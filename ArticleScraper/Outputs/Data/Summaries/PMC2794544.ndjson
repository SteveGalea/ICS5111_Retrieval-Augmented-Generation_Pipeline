{"summary": "human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are members of the recently expanded Enterovirus genus. they have a 7200 base single stranded RNA genome and a non-enveloped virion of approximately 30 nm in diameter. their genome organisation and structure are typical for picornaviruses. the large number of distinct genetic lineages identifiable by sequence comparisons in the VP4/VP2 gene region may thus correspond to different serotypes of HRV-C [13], [18], [19], implying major antigenic differences that influence immunological cross-protection in this newly discovered species. initial data however shows no differences in clinical presentations between HRV-C variants with A and C 5\u2032UTR-like sequences. non-selective amplification of all HRV (and HEV) species would have identified an extremely large number of non-HRV-C positive samples that would preclude effective screening using pools. sensitivity and specificity of the selective PCR was evaluated using samples previously identified as HRV-A, -B and \u2013C variants in a previous study. selective primers were moderately effective at selective amplification of species C variants with an overall specificity of 89% in a screened population. a total of 54 putative HRV-C (geno)types could be assigned using previously described criteria. a total of 6 were distinct from previously deposited HRV-C sequences. between 5\u2032UTR and phylogenetic grouping in VP4/VP2 suggestive of recombination are arrowed. for the 13 subjects who were repeatedly positive for HRV-C in the same calendar month, VP4/VP2 gene sequences were similar or identical. those with positive samples separated by one month or longer were invariably infected with different HRV-C types. the only exception to this correlation was a long-term hospitalised patient with acute my all variants of the same (geno)type assigned in the VP4/VP2-encoding region contained the same 5\u2032UTR group. however, two exceptions, the HRV-Ca samples R3856/07 clustered closely with HRV-Cc variants. these observations imply ongoing, bi-directional and frequently recent recombination events. the y-axis depicts the proportion of subjects positive from the total in each category. the y-axis depicts the proportion of subjects positive from the total in each category. detecting frequencies of HRV-C and other respiratory viruses among subjects presenting with LRTIs, URTIs and those without respiratory symptoms were compared. HRV-C was nearly three times more commonly detected in those co-infected with adenovirus (16.0%) than in mono-infected subjects (5.8%; p0.001). HRV-C had a highly significant effect on detection frequencies of RSV and other respiratory viruses. onaviruses, HBoV, HPeV were separately analysed (x-axis, top) for each, mono-infection frequencies were compared with those where HRV-C, RSV, AdV and other respiratory viruses were co-detected. the existence of statistically significant differences in frequencies was determined by chi-squared test; NS: not significant. a total of 2787 samples collected from 1540 study subjects initially combined into pools of 10 and with positive pools split and re-tested as previously described. on nucleotide sequencing of the amplified VP4/VP2 gene region, 144 samples were identified as belonging to species C. a total of 162 samples were positive on initial screening. the neighbour-joining tree was constructed using maximum composite likelihood distances estimated between sequences in the amplified region. data was bootstrap re-sampled 100 times to assess robustness of branches; values of 70% or greater shown. the majority of HRV-C variants characterised in the current study from separate infection episodes (96 from 141; 68%) contained species A-like 5\u2032UTR sequences, termed HRV-Ca [19] the majority of HRV-C variants characterised in the current study contained species A-like 5\u2032UTR sequences, termed HRV-Ca. 85% of HRV-C infections were observed in children younger than 2 years of age. no systematic difference was evident between HRV-Ca and HRV-Cc in their seasonal distribution or age range of infection. HRV-C was twice as frequently detected in subjects with respiratory disease than in those without relevant symptoms (p = 0.009 by Chi-squared test) there was no significant difference between disease categories in the proportion of HRV-Ca and HRV-Cc variants. study subjects showed a 5.8% HRV-C mono-infection frequency compared to 4.6% and 8.6% in those co-infected with RSV and other respiratory viruses respectively. each of the three most frequently detected respiratory viruses (HRV-C, RSV and AdV) and a combined group of others (influenza A and B, PIV1-3, hMPV, coronaviruses, HBoV, HPeV) were separately analysed (x-axis, a total of 60 types could be provisionally assigned on the basis of VP4/VP2 gene sequence divergence. the findings are consistent with previous observations for a 10\u201321 day period of virus shedding of HRV in immunocompetent individuals [23]\u2013[26]. published sequence data from both the 5\u2032UTR and VP4/VP2 gene regions is only available from 34 Chinese species C strains. these were classified into 20 HRV-Ca and 14 HRV-Cc variants. other studies from south Korea and Italy separated species C variants into HRV-Ca and HRV-Cc groups. the occurrence of multiple recombination events is consistent with recent observations for differences in the recombination breakpoints between different HRV-Ca and HRV-Cc variants. a variant in the current study differed in 5\u2032UTR group from other members of the same type (the HRV-Ca strain R3856/07 clustered with HRV-Cc variants) 5\u2032UTR sequences from HEV-A and -B were similarly interspersed in this region, as were sequences from species C and D, implying a similar process of frequent interspecies recombination. no evidence was gained in this study for any distinct epidemiological features or in their clinical presentations that might originate from hypothesised fitness differences. a longer study period would be required to discount the effect of year-on-year fluctuations in the incidence of species C. it is increasingly recognised that HRVs are collectively underestimated as a cause of significant respiratory illness [27], [32]. predicted prevalence matches closely to that of the control group in the current study. the increased frequency in the LRTI and URTI groups is therefore consistent with its proposed aetiological role in respiratory disease among the predominantly hospitalised study subjects. the order of acquisition of infections may be largely ineffective in a respiratory tract already induced into an antiviral state by prior infection with HRV-C. if RSV infected the respiratory tract first, then this would have no effect on the subsequent susceptibility of the individual to HRV. study provides evidence for the substantial clinical impact of HRV species C infections in young children, their associations with respiratory disease and interfering effects on susceptibility to other virus infections. recent surge of interest in rhinoviruses following unexpected discovery of species C will undoubtedly contribute to a major re-appraisal of the roles of all three species in paediatric respiratory disease. a total of 60 types could be provisionally assigned in the VP4/VP2-encoding region. the 10% pairwise distance threshold in VP4/VP2-encoding region matched the divergence that effectively categorises HRV species A and B into their 74 and 25 constituent serotypes. the occurrence of multiple recombination events is consistent with recent observations for differences in the recombination breakpoints between different HRV-Ca and HRV-Cc variants. we do not know and likely cannot reconstruct the actual evolutionary steps that created the complex phylogeny relationships in this genomic region. a variant in the current study differed in 5\u2032UTR group from other members of the same type. PCR assays using 5\u2032UTR and VP4/VP2 gene primers may have amplified a different (species A-like) 5\u2032UTR sequence from that possessed by the species C virus in the VP4 gene. recombination in species C and absence of species A rhinoviruses with group C 5\u2032UTR sequences suggests possession of group A 5\u2032UTR may be advantageous. however, no evidence was gained in this study for any distinct epidemiological features or in their clinical presentations. detecting HRV-C mono-infection in a substantial proportion of subjects presenting with LRTIs and URTIs is concordant with recent PCR-based studies [13]\u2013[17], [29], [33], [34] that demonstrate a numerically significant role for HRV-C and other rhinovirus species in severe respiratory disease requiring hospitalisation in children and exacerbation of asthma. there is no published information on the rate of asymptomatic infections with species C rhinovirus HRV and Co-Infection Frequency In the current study, all samples were screened for an extended range of human respiratory viruses. this allowed a detailed investigation of frequencies of virus co-infections among subjects presenting with respiratory illnesses. most striking observation was the evidence for interference of RSV and other respiratory viruses by HRV-C. if, however, RSV infected the respiratory tract first, then this would have no effect on the subsequent susceptibility of the individual to HRV. successful colonisation of the respiratory tract by coronaviruses, influenza and parainfluenza viruses is dependent on a wide variety of evolved mechanisms to evade intracellular defences. the recent surge of interest in rhinoviruses following the discovery of species C will undoubtedly contribute to a major re-appraisal of the roles of all three species in paediatric respiratory disease. upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) with coryza, sore throat, tonsillitis and tracheitis were also classified as an URTI symptom. subjects with no relevant respiratory symptoms included referral categories of vomiting, diarrhoea, trauma and elective cardiac surgery. published sequences included the 9 complete genome sequences of HRV-C available on GenBank and all species C VP4(/VP2) gene sequences available on GenBank in august 2009. phylogenetic trees were constructed by neighbour joining from 100 samplings of maximum-composite-likelihood (MCL) distances. study incorporated previously collected data from 456 samples collected in September, 2006 and February, 2007. subjects with no relevant respiratory symptoms included vomiting, diarrhoea, trauma and elective cardiac surgery. subjects with no relevant respiratory symptoms included vomiting, diarrhoea, trauma and elective cardiac surgery. isation, archiving and screening of diagnostic specimens was obtained from the Lothian Regional Ethics Committee (08/S11/02/2) information retained through anonymisation included age band, partial postcode, any recorded symptoms or clinical information, referral source, month of sample collection, and results of other virological testing of each sample. VP4/VP2 sequences generated in this study have been assigned GenBank accession numbers GU294336-GU294480. HRV-C positive samples identified on VP4/VP2 gene screening were amplified in the 5\u2032UTR region."}
