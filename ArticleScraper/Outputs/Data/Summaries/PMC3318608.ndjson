{"summary": "the 230-kb linear, double-stranded DNA genome consists of long unique (UL) and short unique (US) sequences. each flanked by the inverted repeats referred to as TRL/IRL and IRS/TRS, resulting in the overall genomic configuration TRL-UL-IRL-IRS-US-TRS. gene content is relatively well conserved across related herpesviruses. gpRL13 and gpUL4 are members of the primate CMV RL11 gene family. the RL11 gene family is comprised of 11 members conserved in both HCMV and chimpanzee CMV (CCMV) members were initially assembled due to the presence of a defined motif in their sequence resembling cellular Thy-1 within a region conserved between other IgSF members. UL7 encodes a hypervariable protein expressed on the cell surface of infected cells. RL11 genes, dispensable for virus growth in cell culture, are among the most variable HCMV genes. RL5A, RL13, and UL9 are members of a restricted set of HCMV hypervariable genes. pUL1 is glycosylated and localizes at the site of virus assembly and secondary envelopment in infected cells. an HCMV mutant with a targeted deletion of UL1 exhibits a growth defect phenotype in retinal pigment epithelium cells but not in fibroblasts. the MRC-5 human fibroblast cell line (ATCC CCL-171, passages 5 to 15) and the U373-MG cell line derived from glio endotheliotropic strain TB40/E (49), TB40/E reconstituted from respective BAC clone TB40/E BAC4 (48) and AD169 reconstituted from respective BAC clone pHB5 (6). MRC-5 cells were infected at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI) and the supernatants of infected cells that exhibited 100% cytopathic effects were cleared of cellular debris by centri TB40/E BAC4 (48) was used for the generation of UL1 deletion viruses, removing the complete UL1 gene. pHB5 was used to generate recombinant AD169 with the UL1 HA epitope-tagged virus. TB40/E BAC4 UL1 and pHB5 UL1-HA mutants were digested with XbaI. the presence of the Kanr gene was further confirmed by probing after Southern blotting with a kanamycin cassette-specific probe. a reverse primer containing the homology region downstream of UL1 was used. s in the UL128 gene locus was performed with DNA extracted from infected cells. HCMV particles were further purified by negative-positive glycerol-tartrate gradient centrifugation as previously described. late-phase gene expression was inhibited by the use of phosphonoacetic acid (PAA; Sigma-Aldrich) a total of 250 g/m1 of PAA was added to the medium at the time of infection. commercial MAbs specific for IE1 (B810R; Chemicon) and pp28 (ab6502; Abcam) were employed. mm-diameter coverslips were mock infected or infected with AD169 UL1-HA for 72 h. cells were then fixed for 20 min at RT in 4% paraformaldehyde freshly prepared in PBS. cells were blocked with PBS containing 2% BSA for 20 min at RT. the removal of N-linked oligosaccharides from cell lysates was carried out by using N-glycosidase F (PNGase F; Roche), according to the manufacturer's specifications. the samples were denatured in glycoprotein-denaturing buffer at 100\u00b0C for 10 min and cooled to 4\u00b0C for 5 min. a total of 1,314 Ig domain-containing human and HCMV proteins were obtained by using the program HMMsearch (19) with an E value cutoff of 103. sequence alignments of homologous Ig domain-containing HCMV proteins and cellular proteins were generated with the help of the CLUSTALW program. MRC-5 cells were infected at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI) the cells were incubated for 2 h with graded volumes of virus-containing supernatants. the inoculums were washed away with a phosphate-buffered saline rinse. nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (4\u2032-6\u2032-diamidine-2-phenylindole; Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 min at room temperature. TB40/E BAC4 (48) was used for the generation of UL1 deletion viruses, removing the complete UL1 gene. a reverse primer containing the homology region downstream of UL1 was used. the TB40/E BAC4 UL1 and pHB5 UL1-HA mutants were digested with XbaI. the pattern of the restriction enzyme was compared to that of wild-type TB40/E BAC4 or wild-type pHB5. recombinant HCMV was excised from both viruses by FLP-mediated recombination. correct mutagenesis was verified by restriction pattern analysis. TB40/E UL1 and the parental virus had not acquired additional mutations in the UL128 gene locus. UL1-specific DNA hybridization probes were labeled with digoxigenin-dUTPs using a DIG DNA labeling kit (Roche) a total of 250 g/m1 of PAA was added to the medium at the time of infection and maintained throughout infection. 555 goat anti-mouse IgG(H+L) and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG(H+L) were used for immunoblotting. MRC-5 cells grown to 90% confluence in 13-mm-diameter coverslips were mock infected or infected with AD169 UL1-HA for 72 h. antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 3% BSA. removal of N-linked oligosaccharides from cell lysates was carried out by using PNGase F. a total of 1,314 Ig domain-containing human and HCMV proteins were obtained by using the program HMMsearch (19) with an E value cutoff of 103. the number of amino acid substitutions per site (K) was calculated for orthologous pairs of HCMV and CCMV proteins by using the PHYLIP program Protdist with default parameters (22). 224-amino-acid type I transmembrane glycoprotein comprises a signal peptide (amino acids 1 to 26), an Ig-like domain (amino acids 45 to 152) with 8 potential N-linked glycosylation sites, a transmembrane region (amino acids 184 to 206) and a short cytoplasmic tail (amino acids 207 to 224) without apparent signaling motifs. a significant sequence similarity multiple alignments of the Ig-like domain of pUL1 and the N-terminal IgV domain of several CEA proteins showed that a number of well-conserved residues in members of the CEA family are also present in pUL1. pUL1 shares key conserved residues with CEA proteins. pULl sequence is found exclusively in HCMV genomes but lacks a counterpart in other CMV lineages and betaherpesviruses. the RL11 gene family is a rapidly evolving and highly variable virus gene family, both in terms of gene members and in terms of sequence divergence across related viruses or strains. aa substitutions/site) RL5a 3.5 RL6 3.3 TRL11 0.7 TRL11 1.9 TRL12 1.6 TRL12 1.9 TRL13 1.2 TRL13 1.9 UL4 2.5 UL4 2.8 UL6 1.2 UL6 3.1 UL7 1.3 UL7 2.3 UL9 2.0 UL9 2.6 UL10 2.3 UL10 2.0 UL11 1.0 UL54 0.1 a aa, amino RNA was isolated from HCMV AD169-infected cells at 72 h p.i., incubated with or without PAA, and processed as described above for panel A. ethidium bromide staining of 28S rRNA (4.8-kb) and 18S rRNA (1.8-kb) species. HCMV lytic gene expression is conventionally divided into three major kinetic classes of viral genes, immediate-early, early, and late. the 224-amino-acid-long UL1 polypeptide is predicted to be expressed as a type I glycoprotein with a signal peptide and a membrane anchor. for this purpose, we generated an HCMV (AD169-derived HB5 background) recombinant virus with an HA tag fused to the UL1 C-terminal end. IE1 pp72 was present, as expected, already being expressed after 4 h p.i. and remaining for the duration of the HCMV replication cycle. a metabolic blockade with PAA resulted in the disappearance of the 55-kDa band, indicating that the UL1 protein is expressed late during HCMV replication. the UL1 protein was -mercaptoethanol resistant, implying that it is not part of a disulfide-linked oligomer in infected MRC-5 cells. the high number of putative N-linked glycan sites (n = 9) present in pUL1 and the difference between the apparent molecular mass (55 kDa) observed for this protein by immunoblotting and the calculated molecular mass (25.5 kDa) of the 224 the staining of GM-130, a cis-Golgi marker, appeared in a dotted ring forming structures in the proximity of pUL1 but did not exhibit a superimposing pattern indicative of colocalizing proteins. alterations in the morphologies of the golgi compartment and the ERGIC were seen during HCMV infection (45). the cellular markers were detected with Alexa 488 goat anti-mouse IgG. pUL1-HA was detected with Alexa 555 goat anti-rabbit IgG. pUL1-HA was detected with a yellow signal in the merge channel. antibodies reactive with the tegument phosphoprotein pp28 and the major virion envelope glycoprotein gB were employed. pUL1 colocalized with pp28 (Fig. 5A) and gB (Fig. 5B), consistent with its presence at the site of viral assembly and final envelopment. this suggests that it might be integrated into the HCMV virion. purified wild-type AD169 virions were used as a negative control. the 55-kDa HA-tagged UL1 band was not detected in wild-type AD169 virions. the tegument phosphoprotein was present only in preparations of infected cells. pUL1 is a structural glycoprotein that forms part of the HCMV envelope. analysis of pUL1 in cell lysates of AD169 UL1-HA-infected MRC-5 cells for 72 h (lane 1) and AD169 UL1-HA virions (lane 3) Western blots were developed by using anti-HA antibodies. TB40 virions exhibit an intact tropism for endothelial as well as epithelial cells. the complete UL1 sequence was removed from the genome of endotheliotropic strain TB40/E, generating the recombinant virus TB40/E UL1. we then infected human MRC-5 cells, retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, and U373-MG cells, derived from glioblastomas MRC-5 (A), RPE (B and C) and U373-MG (D) cells were infected with TB40/E or TB40/E UL1 at MOIs of 0.025 (A), 0.1 (B), 5 (C) and 0.3 (D). pUL1 gene encodes a 224-amino-acid type I transmembrane glycoprotein. sites, a transmembrane region (amino acids 184 to 206) and a short cytoplasmic tail (amino acids 207 to 224) without apparent signaling motifs. we performed BLASTP searches of all RL11 gene family members. a significant sequence similarity (E value of 103) was found between the Ig-like domain in pUL1 and the N-terminal IgV-like domain in the CEA family. pUL1 shares key conserved residues with RL11 proteins. a schematic drawing of the 224-amino-acid UL1 protein is shown. pUL1 shares key conserved residues with CEA proteins. the pULl sequence is found exclusively in HCMV genomes but lacks a counterpart in other CMV lineages and betaherpesviruses. to better understand the origin and evolution of the RL11 gene family, we determined the number of amino acid substitutions per site (K) between RL11 HCMV-CCMV orthologous proteins. the estimated number of amino acid substitutions per site (K) between RL11 HCMV-CCMV orthologous proteins is, on average UL1 extends from nucleotide 11835 to 12509 (675 bp) in the HCMV AD169 genome, UL1 extends from nucleotide 11835 to 12509. large UL1 transcripts, of approximately 5.8 kb and 3.8 kb, could be detected no earlier than 48 to 72 h p.i. ethidium bromide staining of 28S rRNA (4.8-kb) and 18S rRNA (1.8-kb) species. HCMV lytic gene expression is conventionally divided into three major kinetic classes of viral genes, immediate-early, early, and late. the presence of UL1 transcripts in MRC-5 cells infected with different HCMV strains (AD169, TB40/E, Toledo, and Towne) for 72 h the 224-amino-acid-long UL1 polypeptide (molecular mass of 25.5 kDa) is predicted to be expressed as a type I glycoprotein with a signal peptide and a membrane anchor. for this purpose, we generated an HCMV (AD169-derived HB5 background) recombinant virus with an HA tag fused to the UL1 C-terminal end. a metabolic blockade with PAA resulted in the disappearance of the 55-kDa band. the UL1 protein was -mercaptoethanol resistant, implying it is not part of a disulfide-linked oligomer in infected MRC-5 cells. pUL1-HA accumulated in a large cytoplasmic compartment. pUL1-containing structures failed to colocalize with several intracellular markers. the staining of GM-130, a cis-Golgi-intermediate compartment (ERGIC), was not detected in uninfected cells. alterations in the morphologies of the Golgi compartment and the ERGIC were seen during HCMV infection (45). a partial colocalization of pUL1-HA and the trans-Golgi marker TGN-46 was observed. a partial colocalization of pUL1-HA in a cytoplasmic compartment was observed. mouse IgG, and pUL1-HA were detected with Alexa 555 goat anti-rabbit IgG. pUL1 did not colocalize with markers of the cis- or medial-Golgi compartment. to further confirm these results, infected cells were incubated with brefeldin A (BFA), and the distributions of pUL1-HA-, GM-130-, and ERGIC-53-positive membranes were compared pUL1 colocalized with pp28 and gB (Fig. 5A) and gB (Fig. 5B) colocalized with tegument and envelope HCMV proteins. MRC-5 cells grown on glass coverslips were infected with AD169 UL1-HA. 169 UL1-HA-infected cells were used as a positive control. the 55-kDa HA-tagged UL1 band was not detected in wild-type AD169 virions, while the tegument phosphoprotein was (Fig. 6A, lane 4). further experiments were performed to define the virion incorporation of pUL1. pUL1 is a structural glycoprotein that forms part of the HCMV envelope. analysis of pUL1 in cell lysates of AD169 UL1-HA-infected MRC-5 cells for 72 h (lane 1) and AD169 UL1-HA virions (lane 3) western blots were developed by using anti-HA, anti-pp28, or anti-IE1 antibodies. the complete UL1 sequence was removed from the genome of endotheliotropic strain TB40/E, generating the recombinant virus TB40/E UL1. we then infected human MRC-5 cells, retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, and U373-MG cells, derived from glioblastomas, at a low MOI with TB40/E UL1 or parental strain TB40/E. MRC-5 (A), RPE (B and C) and U373-MG (D) cells were infected with TB40/E or TB40/E UL1 at an MOI of 5. these results indicate that pUL1 is required for efficient HCMV growth in a cell type-specific manner. each data point represents the average and standard deviation of data from three separate cultures. pUL1 is a PNGase F-sensitive glycoprotein, with a putative C-terminal transmembrane anchor domain. in infected human fibroblasts, pUL1 is targeted to a cytoplasmic site. pUL1 belongs to the highly variable and rapidly evolving RL11 gene family. pUL1 may have originated from a gene from the RL11-TRL cluster (TRL11, TRL12, or TRL13) this is supported by the K values found between UL1 and its closest homologues. a substantial heterogeneity of pUL1 among different HCMV strains has been appreciated (16, 47) pUL1 bears 9 potential N-glycosylation sites that are modified by N-linked carbohydrates. eight of them residing in the Ig-like domain and the remaining one residing in the 32-amino-acid stretch that connects the Ig-like domain to the transmembrane sequence. the HCMV envelope is still incompletely defined (8). conserved residues found in several members of the CEA family are also present in pUL1. this raises the possibility that pUL1 acts as a decoy receptor mimicking host CEA proteins. pUL1 is dispensable for HCMV growth in cell culture. pUL1 has the potential to modulate HCMV host cell tropism. a TB40/E mutant lacking UL1 showed attenuated growth in RPE cells. this was not observed for MRC-5 or U373-MG cells. this differential growth phenotype is MOI dependent."}
