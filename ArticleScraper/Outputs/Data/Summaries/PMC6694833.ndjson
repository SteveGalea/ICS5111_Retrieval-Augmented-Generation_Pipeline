{"summary": "inTRODUCTION Zika virus (ZIKV) is a member of the Flavivirus genus in the Flaviviridae family. other members of the genus include dengue virus (DENV), west Nile virus (WNV), yellow fever virus (YFV) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) (1, 2). recombinant subunit vaccines have better safety over attenuated viral vaccines. unlike attenuated vaccines, subunit vaccines do not contain residual infectivity. structure-based vaccine designs have been intensively pursued to improve efficacy of subunit vaccines. the strategy of using NII to quantitatively characterize epitopes has not been extended to subunit vaccine designs targeting another virus. we analyzed the tertiary structure of ZIKV EDIII, identified an artificially exposed epitope on the vaccine surface, shielded it with a glycan probe and measured its efficacy. the mutant EDIII generated in this study can be a promising subunit vaccine candidate for preventing ZIKV infections in humans. both proteins contain a C-terminal Fc tag and were purified to homogeneity. the mutant EDIII ran slower and with a slightly larger molecular weight than wild-type EDIII. the mutant EDIII ran slower and with a slightly larger molecular weight than wild-type EDIII. proteins (5 g) were analyzed using ZIKV E-His-specific mouse polyclonal antibodies (1:1,000) and HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:5,000). mouse mAbs ZV-2 and ZV-54, as well as human MAbs ZV-67, ZKA64-LALA, Z004 and SMZAb5 were detected for neutralizing activity against ZIKV strain R103451 using the plaque reduction SMZAb5 can potently neutralize ZIKV infections in mice and/or in vitro. mutant EDIII bound to ZV-54, ZV-67, ZKA64-LALA, Z004 and SMZAb5. mutant EDIII has successfully incorporated a glycan at residue 375. we previously defined the neutralizing immunogenicity index of an epitope as the contribution of the epitope to the overall neutralizing immunogenicity of the vaccine. for epitope 375 on ZIKV EDIII, the NII can be calculated as the difference between the neutralizing immunogenicity of wild-type EDIII and that of the mutant EDIII, divided by the neutralizing immunogenicity of wild-type EDIII. values of NII varied slightly in different mice. the negative NII confirms the negative contribution of epitope 375 to the overall neutralizing immunogenicity of the vaccine. masking epitope 375 increases the overall neutralizing immunogenicity of the vaccine by 50%, 76%, and 34%. the IgG antibody titers are expressed as the endpoint dilutions that remain positively detectable. serum neutralizing antibody titers represent PRNT50 neutralizing antibody titers for the wild-type and mutant EDIII proteins. the wild-type and mutant EDIII vaccines induced the same amount of IgG antibody titers. mutant EDIII elicited significantly higher titers of anti-ZIKV neutralizing antibodies than wild-type EDIII did. the wild-type and mutant EDIII vaccines were immunized with the wild-type and mutant EDIII protein vaccines. sera were collected on day 10 post-2nd immunization for detection of IgG subtype antibodies (A to E) that specifically targeted ZIKV EDIII protein. mutant-EDIII-immunized pregnant mice had undetectable viral titers and RNA copies in placenta and fetal brain. negative-control pregnant mice, treated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), contained significantly higher viral titers and RNA copies in their tissues. there were no significant morphological changes in the uteri of the wild-type- and mutant-EDIII-immunized pregnant mice. quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) (B) assays 6 days after challenge. detection limit for plaque assay was 20 PFU/g. qRT-PCR was 2.5 102 RNA copies/g, of tissue. the viral titers were high in all the tested tissues and fetal brain. there were significant morphological changes in the uteri, with severe fetal resorption or fetal death. male Ifnar1/ mice were immunized with either the wild-type or mutant EDIII vaccine and then challenged with low-dose ZIKV. mutant EDIII vaccine protects pregnant mice and their fetuses from ZIKV infection more effectively than wild-type EDIII vaccine. pregnant mice were challenged with EDIII strain R103451 (103 PFU) and tested for viral titers 6 days postchallenge. adult male Ifnar1/ mice were immunized with the ZIKV WT and mutant (M375N/E377T) EDIII proteins, or PBS control, and challenged with ZIKV (R103451; 103 PFU) 10 days post-2nd immunization to evaluate survival (A) and weight (B) for 14 days. the surviving Ifnar1/ mice in the WT and mutant (M375N/E377T) groups were further challenged viremia was significantly lower in the mice passively transferred with mutant-EDIII-induced sera than in those transferred with the wild-type-EDIII-induced sera. while 77% of the mice transferred with the mutant-EDIII-induced sera survived the ZIKV challenge, mice transferred with undiluted sera all survived the ZIKV challenge (100% survival) challenge with ZIKV strain R103451 followed by evaluation of serum viral titers in the sera of challenged mice collected on days 3 and 5 postchallenge. survival and weight changes for 14 days were also recorded. mutant-EDIII-induced mouse sera blocked binding between wild-type EDIII and EDIII-specific neutralizing MAbs more effectively. ELISA was performed to detect binding between human neutralizing MAbs and wild-type EDIII protein in the presence of mutant (M375N/E377T) EDIII-induced mouse sera. binding was calculated in the presence or absence of immune sera. differences between WT- and mutant-EDIII-induced immune sera are shown. the experiments were repeated twice, and similar results were obtained. EDIII of monomeric subunit A is colored in magenta. the two monomeric subunits are colored green and cyan. EDIII of monomeric subunit A is colored in magenta. ELISA was performed to test the binding of mutant M375N/E377T protein to ZIKV EDIII-specific MAbs ZV-2 (a), ZV-54 (b), ZV-67 (c), ZKA64-LALA (d), Z004 (e) and SMZAb5 (f). the experiments were repeated three times and similar results were obtained. structural analysis of EDIII complexed with Z004 identified the lateral ridge (away from epitope 375) of EDIII as its recognizing epitope. despite the introduced glycan, the mutant EDIII retains its native structural conformation and antigenicity by binding to five different neutralizing MAbs. we immunized mice with wild-type EDIII and mutant EDIII individually. we measured the neutralizing antibody titers of the induced sera. the immunized mice included immunocompetent BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice as well as immunocompromised interferon-/ receptor-deficient (Ifnar1/) mice. epitope 375 is an immunodominant nonneutralizing epitope. it can significantly improve the neutralizing immunogenicity of the EDIII vaccine. the data are presented as mean PRNT50 SEM of quadruplicate wells of 2-fold serially diluted sera. mutant represent PRNT50 neutralizing antibody titers for the wild-type and mutant EDIII proteins. the data are presented as means SEM of quadruplicate wells of 2-fold serially diluted sera (pooled from 5 mice in each group) the results showed that IgG1 was the predominant subtype induced by both vaccines in all mouse strains. compared to the wild-type EDIII, the mutant EDIII induced more IgG1a, IgG2b, and/or IgG2c subtypes in these mice. the antibody titers are expressed in the form of the endpoint titers calculated as the reciprocal of the highest detectable dilution. the experiments were repeated three times, and similar results were obtained. mutant EDIII vaccine provides enhanced efficacy in protection of pregnant mice from ZIKV infection. both the wild-type and mutant EDIII vaccines protect the fetuses of immunocompetent pregnant mice from ZIKV infection. unocompromised mice are lethal models for ZIKV infection. we immunized female and male Ifnar1/ pregnant mice with either the wild-type or mutant EDIII vaccine. we then challenged adult male Ifnar1/ mice with low-dose ZIKV. mutant-EDIII-immunized mice all survived 14 days post-1st challenge. weight decreased slightly during days 4 to 7 postinfection. all mice had at least 25% weight loss and were humanely euthanized 10 days postinfection. pregnant mice (E10-E13) were challenged with ZIKV strain R103451 (103 PFU) and tested for viral titers using plaque assay. detection limit for lung and heart was 25 PFU/g, and for liver, muscle, placenta, and fetal brain was 20 PFU/g, of tissue. the percent weight in panels B and D represents the mean percent weight of all surviving mice at the indicated days after challenge. viremia was significantly lower in the mice passively transferred with the mutant-EDIII-induced sera than in those transferred with the wild-type-EDIII-induced sera. mutant-EDIII-induced sera had significantly higher anti-ZIKV neutralizing antibody titers than wild-type-EDIII-induced sera. negative-control mice transferred with the mutant-EDIII-induced sera had a 0% survival rate at day 10 postchallenge. mutant-EDIII-induced sera contained significantly higher anti-ZIKV neutralizing antibody titers. IKV challenge were also recorded. the percent weight in panel C represents the mean percent weight of all surviving mice. tralizing epitope 375 triggered the host immune system to refocus on neutralizing epitopes. ELISA was performed to detect the binding between human neutralizing MAbs and wild-type EDIII protein. the immune sera were from BALB/c (A to D) and Ifnar1/ (E to H) mice. a number of vaccine candidates have been tested in mouse and nonhuman primate models for ZIKV infection (16, 17, 35\u201337) some of these candidates are currently in clinical trials (7\u20139, 38) subunit vaccines contain only the antigenic components of the pathogen. epitope 375 shielded the mutant ZIKV EDIII. mutant EDIII bound to EDIII-specific neutralizing MAbs through its receptor-binding regions. but only the wild-type EDIII, and not the mutant EDIII, bound to an EDIII-specific nonneutralizing MAb targeting epitope 375. compared to the wild-type EDIII vaccine, the mutant EDIII vaccine protected female pregnant mice and their fetuses more effectively. the mutant-EDIII-immunized mouse sera passively protected mice more effectively than the wild-type-EDIII-immunized mouse sera against lethal ZIKV challenge. aluminum hydroxide and MPL adjuvant combination elicited high-titer neutralizing antibodies in conjugation with wild-type and mutant ZIKV EDIII vaccines. aluminum hydroxide and MPL adjuvant combination elicited high-titer neutralizing antibodies in conjugation with both the wild-type and mutant ZIKV EDIII vaccines. aluminum hydroxide and MPL adjuvant combination helps induction of IgG2. future studies will be needed to compare immunogenicity of ZIKV EDIII vaccines in the presence of aluminum hydroxide and MPL adjuvant combination, aluminum hydroxide alone, or MPL alone. this study is the second successful application of the concept of NII in vaccine design. /c and C57BL/6 mice and 3- to 6-week-old male and female Ifnar1/ mice were used in the study. the recombinant proteins were prepared as previously described. aluminum hydroxide adjuvant (500 g/mouse, vau-alu-250; InvivoGen) and monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) adjuvant (500 g/mouse, vac-mpla; InvivoGen) immunized mice were boosted once with the same immunogens at 4 weeks. sera were collected 10 days post-last immunization to test antibody responses and neutralizing antibodies. ELISA plates were coated with the wild-type or mutant ZIKV EDIII protein overnight at 4\u00b0C and blocked with 2% fat-free milk in PBST for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. ELISA plates were sequentially incubated with serially diluted MAbs and HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG-Fab (for ZV-2 and ZV-54, 1:5,000; Thermo Fisher Scientific) b5) and mutant EDIII-induced mouse sera for binding of wild-type ZIKV EDIII was performed using ELISA as described above. binding between wild-type EDIII and the MAbs was tested in the presence of serially diluted mouse sera induced by the ZIKV EDIII vaccine (wild type or mutant) or PBS. the cells were overlaid with medium (1% carboxymethyl cellulose in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium [DMEM] containing 2% fetal bovine serum [FBS] and cultured at 37\u00b0C for 4 to 5 days before being stained with 0.5% crystal violet. dilutions and neutralizations of sera or MAbs were calculated using the CalcuSyn computer program. surviving Ifnar1/ mice in wild-type or mutant ZIKV EDIII groups were immunized. mice with 25% body weight loss were humanely euthanized. qRT-PCR. RNA copies in sera and tissues of challenged mice were detected. the forward and reverse primers for the amplification were 5\u2032-TTGGTCATGATACTGCTGATTGC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CCTTCCACAAAGTCCCTATTGC-3\u2032. qRT-PCR was established by serial dilutions of a recombinant plasmid containing ZIKV membrane (M) and E genes. animal studies were carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the care and use of laboratory animals. the protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the New York Blood Center (permit numbers 344.00 and 345.01) immunized mice were boosted once with the same immunogens at 4 weeks. sera were collected 10 days post-last immunization to test antibody responses and neutralizing antibodies. group of five BALB/c mice (4 to 6 weeks old) were immunized and boosted with the EDIII vaccine (wild type or mutant) -type or mutant ZIKV EDIII protein overnight at 4\u00b0C. after three washes, plates were sequentially incubated with serially diluted MAbs and HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG-Fab. reaction was detected using substrate 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma). the EDIII-MAb binding was measured by addition of HRP-conjugated anti-human antibody (1:5,000) and subsequent enzymatic reaction. the titers were detected from around 40 or 50 mg of tissue samples. the detection limit was about 25 or 20 PFU/ml of sera. dilutions and neutralizations of sera or MAbs were calculated using the CalcuSyn computer program. specific PRNT50 and ND50 of sera or MAbs were obtained. female Ifnar1/ and BALB/c mice immunized with ZIKV EDIII were mated with respective naive male mice within the same strain. groups of 5 to 13 male and female Ifnar1/ mice were injected with pooled sera (200 l/mouse; normalized for equal ZIKV EDIII-specific IgG titers at 105 or a 1:5 dilution in PBS) mice were i.p. challenged with ZIKV strain R103451 (103 PFU) reverse primers for the amplification were 5\u2032-TTGGTCATGATACTGCTGATTGC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CCTTCCACAAAGTCCCTATTGC-3\u2032. qRT-PCR was established by serial dilutions of a recombinant plasmid containing ZIKV membrane (M) and E genes."}
