{"summary": "the aims of this study were to compare serum procalcitonin (PCT) levels between febrile children with Kawasaki disease (KD) and those with bacterial or viral infections. the patients were divided into 3 groups as follows: 49 with KD, 111 with viral infections, and 24 with bacterial infections. PCT levels were found to be significantly elevated in patients with bacterial or fungal infections, but normal or slightly elevated in those with several inflammatory diseases. PCT was found to be a significant biomarker for diagnosing pediatric urinary tract infection and neonatal sepsis, and for identifying patients without serious bacterial infections. the age range of the enrolled patients was from 29 days to 5 years. complete KD was diagnosed in cases in which a fever persisted for 5 days. incomplete KD was diagnosed when fewer than four of the 5 typical clinical manifestations were observed. serum PCT levels were measured by using electrochemiluminescence immunoassays. serum PCT levels were measured by using latex-enhanced immunoturbidimetry. complete KD was diagnosed in cases in which a fever persisted for 5 days. at least 4 of the 5 typical clinical manifestations were observed. nonresponders included patients with KD whose fever subsided within 48 hours after initial treatment. MS PCT, Roche, Henningsdorf, Germany) with a detection range of 0.02\u2013100 ng/mL. the following cutoff levels of PCT were used to determine whether antibiotic treatment would be used. the most commonly detected virus was respiratory syncytial virus A/B (40 of 108, 37%), followed by rhinovirus (22 of 108, 20%) and parainfluenza (17 of 108, 16%). most common diagnosis was acute lower respiratory tract infection. 24 patients with bacterial infections, the causative organisms were Staphylococcus or Streptococcus in blood, and Enterococcus, Escherichia coli, or Klebsiella pneumoniae in urine. the final diagnoses of bacterial infections were septicemia, pneumonia, cellulitis, and urinary tract infections. the mean PCT level in the KD group was significantly higher than that in the viral and bacterial infection groups (P0.001 and P0.001) the mean PCT level in the bacterial infection group was significantly higher than that in the viral and bacterial group (P0.001 and P0.001). the number of patients according to PCT levels in each group is shown in Table 2. the number of patients with PCT levels 0.25 ng/mL and >1.0 ng/mL was significantly different between the KD and viral infection groups (P=0.001) and between the viral infection and bacterial infection groups (P=0.099) there was no significant difference in PCT levels between patients with complete and incomplete KD (P=0.477) responders, 2 (18%) had a PCT level 0.25 ng/mL. 4 (36%) had a PCT level >1.0 ng/mL. 184 patients were enrolled in this study, including 49 with KD. 38 patients were classified as responders and 11 patients as nonresponders. most commonly detected virus was respiratory syncytial virus A/B. most common diagnosis was acute lower respiratory tract infection. patients in the KD group had a significantly longer fever duration before admission than those in the viral and bacterial infection groups (P=0.001 and P0.001) the bacterial infection group had a significantly longer fever duration before admission than the viral infection group (P=0.001) wasaki disease versus viral infections. P0.05 in viral infections versus bacterial infections. the mean WBC count in the KD and bacterial infection groups was significantly higher than that in the viral infection group (P=0.044 and P=0.005) the mean neutrophil proportion in the KD group was significantly higher than that in the viral infection group (P0.001 and P0.001). the proportion of patients with each PCT level was not significantly different between the 38 complete and 8 incomplete KD patients (P=0.477) of the 49 KD patients, 5 who had 0.5PCT levels1.0 were excluded in the figure. patients with KD with PCT levels >1.0 ng/mL tended to be nonresponders to initial IVIG treatment. PCT is more accurate than CRP in differentiating bacterial infections from noninfectious inflammation1. patients with KD do not respond to antibiotic therapy and require IVIG treatment. we hypothesize that serum PCT level may differentiate KD from other infections. the first study of PCT levels in patients with KD was reported in 2004. a recent study enrolled 77 patients with complete KD and 24 patients with incomplete KD. nonresponders to initial IVIG more frequently had complete KD than incomplete KD. the PCT level seems to be useful in predicting IVIG response. the PCT levels may help differentiate KD from bacterial infections. a combination of disease markers including ESR, CRP, and PCT may be useful for differentiating between KD and viral or bacterial infections."}
