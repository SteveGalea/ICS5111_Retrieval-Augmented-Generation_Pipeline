{"summary": "mDEF201 doses of 105 to 107 PFU/mouse administered to the lungs in a 50-l volume 24 h prior to virus challenge protected 90\u2013100% of mice from death. the same report described giving a single 107 dose of mDEF201 56 days (8 weeks) prior to infection, with a 90% survival outcome. systemic infections were produced by intraperitoneal infection with virus [3] and primarily LRI and URI infections were developed by using either a large (50-l) or small (5-l) i.n. infection volume [4] these models are useful to address the efficacy of mDEF201 in treating various types of infections caused by cowpox and vaccinia viruses. a single dose given 56 days prior to vaccinia virus challenge provided remarkable protection. human DEF201 appears to hold promise as both a prophylactic and early treatment agent. the experiments were conducted in accordance with protocol 552 approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Utah State University. cowpox virus (Brighton strain) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) the cowpox virus contained a syncytium forming (SF) variant. placebo-treated mice were given saline by i.n. route. each animal was weighed every other day starting the day before and during the 21-day infection period. separate animals were maintained for determination of tissue virus titers and lung hemorrhage scores. adenovirus vectored mouse interferon alpha, mDEF201, was prepared at the Robert Fitzhenry Vector Laboratory (McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada) mDEF201 was cloned into a replication deficient Ad-5 vector (deletions of E1 and E3 genes), amplified in 293 cells and purified by cesium chloride gradient centrifugation. WR strain was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. cowpox virus contained a syncytium forming (SF) variant that was isolated. 10 mice in each mDEF201 or cidofovir treated group and 20 placebos per experiment. each animal was sacrificed for removal of tissues after 5 days of infection. lungs, spleens, livers, and snouts were weighed prior to homogenization. mDEF201 Prophylaxis delivered via nasal sinus or lung mDEF201 protected mice from death. mDEF201 protected against weight loss as well as a nasal delivered 107 dose and cidofovir. mDEF201 deposited primarily in the sinuses (5-l volume) or in the lungs would have to generate interferon that ultimately needs to reach the liver and other organs for protection. each dose of mDEF201 delivered to the lungs was less protective (11/30 survived) than the same dose delivered to the nasal sinus (21/30 survived) mDEF201 was administered to the lung before cowpox virus infection. lower doses of mDEF201 could not prevent severe infection-induced weight loss. mDEF201 was administered to the lung before cowpox virus infection. the syncytium forming strain of cowpox virus in a low volume inoculum works well for causing a lethal upper respiratory tract infection in mice [4], and there is minimal LRI involvement. URIs were treated with mDEF201 delivered to the nasal sinus (5 l) or lung (50 l) intranasal (5- and 50-l) treatments with mDEF201 were given one time only 24 hours prior to virus exposure. there were 10 treated animals per group and 20 placebos per group at the start of the experiment. 107 dose of mDEF201 administered 56 days pre-infection was significantly different (P0.05 or less) than all other treatments. spleen virus titers were undetectable in animals treated with mDEF201 either 56 days or 1 day before virus challenge. mDEF201 treatments were effective against vaccinia virus infections initiated by 50-l virus infection volumes [1] this virus infection method causes more of a lung infection that a sinus infection (URI) and virus dissemination to other tissues (such as liver and spleen) is lower. treatment with mDEF201 (5- and 50-l) and cidofovir (pFU/mouse) were given one time only 24 hours prior to virus exposure. mDEF201 was administered i.p. once a day for two days at 4 and 24 hours after infection. intranasal 5- and 50-l treatments with mDEF201 (PFU/mouse) were given one time only 24 hours prior to virus exposure. there were 10 treated animals per group and 20 placebos per group at the start of the experiment. cowpox virus URIs were treated with mDEF201 delivered to the nasal sinus (5 l) or lung (50 l) the small volume would concentrate the vector at the site of infection, whereas the large volume would deposit most of the vector more diffusely in the lungs. 106 doses of mDEF201 were administered via nasal sinus or lung. results suggest upper respiratory tract infections are more difficult to treat with mDEF201, even when very concentrated amounts of mDEF201 are administered locally. 106 dose administered 56 days pre-infection showed comparable virus titer reduction to the 106 dose given 1 day prior to infection. spleen virus titers were undetectable in animals treated with mDEF201 either 56 days or 1 day before virus challenge. single 50-l i.n. treatments (PFU/mouse) were given on the day indicated prior to virus challenge. determinations were made five days after infection. mDEF201 delivered to the nasal sinus required a 10-fold higher dose than that delivered to the lungs. Conversely, in the vaccinia virus systemic infection, mDEF201 delivered via nasal sinus were clearly superior to lung dosing. this is the first report where mDEF201 is reported to be active against cowpox virus infections in mice. this is the first report where mDEF201 is reported to be active against cowpox virus infections in mice. mDEF201 was administered 56 days (8 weeks) prior to infection. 106 doses administered 8 weeks pre-infection provided a similar degree of viral titer reduction capacity. also, lung weights and lung hemorrhage scores in these mice were similarly improved. mDEF201 may provide significant protection to first responders and medical chain personnel confronted with a deliberate release of variola or monkeypox virus into the environment. many unrelated virus infections are important to both biodefense and public health."}
