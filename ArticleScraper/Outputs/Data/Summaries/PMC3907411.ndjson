{"summary": "lineageCD34+CD31+ cells isolated from peripheral blood of severely burned patients were shown to be inhibitory on the HBD production by normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) the lack of antimicrobial peptide production leads to the invasion of pathogens from surface infections to systemic infections [11]. mice were grafted with unburned skin tissues of severely burned patients. they were inoculated with their syngeneic peripheral blood CD31+ IMC (patient chimera substitutes) experimentally induced CD31+ IMC were isolated from peripheral blood of healthy volunteers 24 hours after intense exercise. antimicrobial peptides were not produced significantly at grafted site skin tissues in patient chimeras. the compound did not directly stimulate the production and mRNA expression of HBD-1 by epidermal keratinocytes. both groups of chimeras treated with glycyrrhizin resisted the infection. these mice were exposed to whole body -irradiation (4 Gy) to deplete neutrophils. neutrophils were not recovered from these mice 1 to 7 days after -irradiation. they were fed autoclaved food and water to avoid infectious complications. jugated anti-CD34 mAb and PE-conjugated anti-CD31 mAb purchased from BD Biosciences. mAbs directed against CCL2 and rIL-10 were purchased from BioLegend. adult normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) were obtained from Lonza. glycyrrhetic acid is the active form of glycyrrhizin for various immunomodulating and anti-inflammatory actions. 1,000 g of the compound was first dissolved in 1 ml of saline or serum free RPMI medium at room temperature. then, it was further diluted to the appropriate concentrations with saline or serum free RPMI medium and stored at 4\u00b0C until utilized. lineageCD34+CD31+ cells were used as experimentally induced CD31+ IMC. experimentally induced CD31+ IMC and patient CD31+ IMC were shown to have identical properties for producing IL-10 and CCL2 and inhibiting HBD-1 production by NHEK. two series of in vitro assays were performed for the determination of anti-IMC activities of glycyrrhizin. glycyrrhizin was administered i.p. to the chimeras 2 and 24 hours after grafting of the peptide-producer cells. the depth of the skin biopsy extended all the way to the skeletal muscles of the back (epidermal, dermal, and panniculus carnosus components) the tissues were weighed and rinsed in cold, sterile PBS containing 1% antibiotic mixture (penicillin 100 U/ml, streptomycin sulicoricehate 100 g/ml) for 2 min. the homogenates were centrifuged (1000 g, 20 min), and supernatants the activities of human -defensins (HBD-1, HBD-2 and HBD-3) were not neutralized by this IgG. -irradiated NOD-SCID IL-2r/ mice were shown to be susceptible (100% died) to 10 CFU/mouse of P. aeruginosa intradermal (i.d.) infection. 80% of the same mice treated with saline survived after infection with 104 CFU/m infected mice were monitored twice a day for signs of disease. survival of infected mice was recorded for up to 7 days after infection. written informed consent was obtained from all adult subjects. ethical approval was obtained from the Ethical and Scientific Committee of the University of Texas Medical Branch. the youngest and oldest ages were 2 and 41 years old. the regimen consisted of fluid resuscitation, topical antimicrobial agents, and aggressive nutrition support based on estimated energy and protein needed. glycyrrhizin is a triterpenoid saponin in Glychyrrhiza glabra (licorice) glycyrrhizin is converted into glychyrrhetic acid by glycaronidase when it is injected to animals and patients. lineageCD34+CD31+ cells (patient CD31+ IMC) were prepared from peripheral mononuclear cells of severely burned patients. same cells were experimentally generated from healthy donor peripheral blood cells. chimeras were grafted with unburned skin tissue removed from burn patients. unburned skin (0.80.8 cm) was implanted in a single layer. exposed area was surgically closed with absorbable sutures. six hours later, mice were intradermally inoculated with 1106 cells/mouse of CD31+ IMC. conditioned media obtained were added to unburned skin (0.20.2 cm) cultures (5\u201320% v/v, 1105 cells/ml) for 48 hours. culture fluids harvested were assayed for HBD-1 by ELISA. uginosa was grown in a brain-heart infusion broth for 18 hours at 37\u00b0C. two days before skin infection, both groups of chimeras were treated s.c. with 100 units of an IgG preparation against anti-murine skin antimicrobial peptide. FU/mouse of P. aeruginosa i.d. infection was shown to be 1 LD50 in these mice not treated with the IgG. two days after IMC inoculation, 100 CFU/0.1 ml of P. aeruginosa was injected i.d. to the grafted skin site of chimeras. xylazine (30 mg/kg, i.p.), and death was assured by cervical dislocation. death was recorded as infection induced mortality. survival curves were analyzed using a Student\u2019s t test. glycyrrhizin is a triterpenoid saponin in Glychyrrhiza glabra (licorice) it is converted into glychyrrhetic acid by glycaronidase when it is injected to animals and patients. glycyrrhizin have been confirmed as non-toxic in many papers [19]\u2013[22]. lineageCD34+CD31+ cells were prepared from peripheral mononuclear cells of severely burned patients. same cells were experimentally generated from healthy donor peripheral blood cells. unburned skin (0.80.8 cm) was implanted in a single layer. exposed area was surgically closed with absorbable sutures. -irradiated NOD-SCID IL-2r/ mice were intradermally inoculated with NHEK (1106 cells/mouse) conditioned media obtained were added to unburned skin (0.20.2 cm) cultures for 48 hours. culture fluids harvested were assayed for HBD-1 by ELISA. effect of glycyrrhizin on HBD-1 production in patient chimeras. both groups of chimeras were treated s.c. with 100 units of an IgG preparation. anti-murine skin AMP rabbit IgG was purified from sera of rabbits. rradiated NOD-SCID IL-2r/ mice treated with the IgG, and 105 CFU/mouse of P. aeruginosa i.d. infection were shown to be 1 LD50 in these mice not treated with the IgG. two days after IMC inoculation, 100 CFU/0.1 ml of P. aeruginosa was injected i.d. to the grafted skin site of chimeras humanely euthanized with ketamine (300 mg/kg, i.p.) and xylazine (30 mg/kg, i.p.) death was recorded as infection induced mortality. survival curves were analyzed using a Student\u2019s t test. murine antimicrobial peptide (MBD-1) was detected in skin homogenates of -irradiated NOD-SCID IL-2r/ mice, while this peptide was not detected in those of the same mice treated with anti-murine AMP rabbit IgG. all of the chimeras created with NHEK alone (chimera A) survived after P. aeruginosa i.d. infection. chimeras created with healthy donor lineageCD34+CD31 cells were shown to be resistant against 100 CFU/mouse of P. aeruginosa i.d. infection. skin antimicrobial peptides (a, murine peptides; b and c, human peptides) are very important in the resistance of mice to P. aeruginosa i.d. infections. chimera substitute were i.d. infected with 20 LD50 of P. aeruginosa. survivals were observed for a week after the infection. antimicrobial peptide production in the grafted site tissues was tested. chimeras created with unburned skin tissues from patients #4#7 and their respective CD31+ IMC were treated twice with 1 to 10 mg/kg of glycyrrhizin. as controls, the chimeras were treated with saline (0.2 ml/mouse) twenty-four hours after the treatment, 5 skin biopsies were obtained from grafted site tissues, homogenized together. in patient chimeras treated with 3 mg/kg of glycyrrhizin, 0.45 g/ml of HBD-1 was detected in their skin homogenates. the impaired peptide production in patient chimeras was not influenced by 1 mg/kg dose of glycyrrhizin treatment. survival of patient chimera substitutes i.d. infected with 20 LD50 of P. aeruginosa was tested bacteria grew in kidneys of all patient chimeras infected with P. aeruginosa. pathogen was not detected significantly in kidneys of the chimeras treated with glycyrrhizin. 3 independent experiments performed using skin and blood specimens from 3 patients. Fig. 3B-1 shows mean SEM of the results shown in Fig. 3B-1. effect of glycyrrhizin on suppressor cell activity of patient CD31+ IMC. skin tissues harvested were analyzed for HBD-1 mRNA. data are representative of 4 individual experiments using unburned skin tissues and CD31+ IMC obtained from patients #12#15. culture fluids harvested from cultures supplemented with or without glycyrrhizin were added to cultures of patient unburned skin tissues. culture fluids harvested from the cultures were assayed for HBD-1 by ELISA. culture fluids harvested were assayed for CCL2 and IL-10 by ELISA. significant amounts of CCL2 and IL-10 were not detected in culture fluids of patient #16 CD31+ IMC treated with glycyrrhizin. similar results were obtained when the experiments were performed with CD31+ IMC from patients #17 and #18. patients #16#18 CD31+ IMC were treated with glycyrrhizin (100 g/ml) for 48 hours. the number of CCL2-producing cells in the cultures was determined by ELISPOT assay. human antimicrobial peptide (MBD-1) was not detected in skin homogenates of -irradiated NOD-SCID IL-2r/ mice treated with or without the IgG. mice depleted of the murine peptides were grafted with NHEK (1106 cells/mouse, i.d.) and inoculated with experimentally induced CD31+ IMC inoculation (chimera B) died within 3 days of the same antibacterial resistance of chimeras created with NHEK against P. aeruginosa i.d. infection is completely inhibited by experimentally induced CD31+ IMC. chimeras created with healthy donor lineageCD34+CD31 cells were shown to be resistant against 100 CFU/mouse of P. aeruginosa i.d. infection. chimeras were infected with P. aeruginosa in the same fashion. survivals were observed for a week after the infection. each infection experiment was performed by a group of 2\u20133 mice. chimeras created with unburned skin tissues from patients #4#7 and their respective CD31+ IMC were treated twice with 1 to 10 mg/kg of glycyrrhizin. as controls, the chimeras were treated with saline (0.2 ml/mouse) twenty-four hours after the treatment, 5 skin biopsies were obtained from grafted site tissues, homogenized together. in patient chimeras treated with 3 mg/kg of glycyrrhizin, 0.45 g/ml of HBD-1 was detected in their skin homogenates. the impaired peptide production in patient chimeras was not influenced by 1 mg/kg dose of glycyrrhizin treatment. survival of patient chimera substitutes i.d. infected with 20 LD50 of P. aeruginosa was tested bacteria grew in kidneys of all patient chimeras infected with P. aeruginosa. pathogen was not detected significantly in kidneys of the chimeras treated with glycyrrhizin. the effect of glycyrrhizin on the suppressor cell activity of patient CD31+ IMC on HBD-1 production by patient unburned skin tissues was examined in vitro. skin tissues in the lower chamber were analyzed for HBD-1 mRNA. skin tissues harvested were analyzed for HBD-1 mRNA by RT-PCR. data are representative of 4 individual experiments using unburned skin tissues and CD31+ IMC obtained from patients #12#15. culture fluids harvested from cultures supplemented with or without glycyrrhizin were added to cultures of patient unburned skin tissues. patients #17 and #18 were treated with or without glycyrrhizin for 12 hours. culture fluids harvested were assayed for CCL2 and IL-10 by ELISA. significant amounts of CCL2 and IL-10 were not detected in culture fluids of patient #16 CD31+ IMC treated with glycyrrhizin. soluble factors were detected in cultures of patient CD31+ IMC not treated with glycyrrhizin. the effects of glycyrrhizin on sepsis stemming from P. aeruginosa burn wound infection were studied in a chimera model of severely burned patients. a glycyrrhizin therapy may be the new paradigm to treat opportunistic burn wound infections. glycyrrhizin was administered i.p. to these chimeras at a dose of 1 to 10 mg/kg. the greatest efficacy of glycyrrhizin on recovering HBD-1 production was seen in the chimeras treated with a 10 mg/kg dose of glycyrrhizin. the protective effect of glycyrrhizin against graft site P. aerugi the effect of glycyrrhizin on the survival of chimera substitutes i.d. infected with a lethal dose of P. aeruginosa was also tested. all chimeras treated with saline died within 3 days of infection. 100% of the same chimeras treated with glycyrrhizin survived more than 7 days after the same infection. the protective effect of glycyrrhizin against grafted site pseudomonal infections in chimeras must be displayed through the host\u2019s antibacterial functions influenced by glycyrrhizin. the importance of skin antimicrobial peptides against invasion of pathogens in wound tissues has been well-described [4]\u2013[7]. glycyrrhizin inhibits cytokine production by CD31+ IMC. glycyrrhizin binds to glucocorticoid-like receptor and mobility group box protein 1. phosphorylation of HMGB1 promotes release of inflammatory cytokines. yrrhizin on the activation of NF-B, STAT3 and MAPKs is important for CCL2 production [47]. increased production of CCL2 requires STAT3 activation [48]. further analytical studies are required."}
