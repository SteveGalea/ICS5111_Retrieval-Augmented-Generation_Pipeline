{"summary": "the immune privileged hypothesis of the brain arose from the unique cells that populate the central nervous system (CNS) many cells in the brain, such as neurons and mature oligodendrocytes, are postmitotic and terminally differentiated. the consequences of these viral brain infections\u2014e.g., meningitis, myelitis, encephalitis, and demyelination\u2014contribute to a significant health burden worldwide. CD8 T cells respond to infections in non-lymphoid organs can differentiate into tissue-resident memory cells (TRM), which remain in the tissue and survey for reinfection [11]. despite their ubiquitous presence following viral infection, the migration of T cells into the brain might depend on the virus and the type of cells infected. IL-1 produced by infiltrating macrophages allowed effector CD8 T cells to extravasate into the brain parenchyma. despite robust recruitment of effector CD8 T cells during early, acute infection, there was little evidence that CD8 T cells continue to infiltrate the brain during late stages of persistent infection. effectsor molecules produced by CD8 T cells fall into two broad categories: cytotoxic granules and cytokines. cytotoxic granules are modified lysozymes that contain perforin, granzymes, and granulysin. these molecules work synergistically on the target cell to induce apoptosis. IFN signaling is thought to reduce viral spread by promoting an antiviral state in infected cells and neighboring uninfected cells. other common effector mechanisms of CD8 T cells, such as perforin-mediated killing, are not effective during LCMV infection of the CNS. we found that IFN produced by virus-specific CD8 T cells in the brain upregulated the expression of MHC class II on microglia. these studies suggest that IFN has simultaneous, conflicting activities during viral infection in the brain: (1) constraining neuropathology by controlling the virus. (2) increasing neuropathology by promoting inflammation. IFN and TNF can induce cell death in oligodendrocytes during inflammatory conditions, suggesting that these cytokines may cause demyelination. inflammatory demyelinating lesions in TMEV, JCPyV-PML IRIS and JHMV infections are enriched with microglia and macrophages. infection of the brain results in the infiltration and persistence of pathogen-specific CD8 bTRM. the resident CD8 T cell population in the brain represents a bona fide CD8 TRM population that provides frontline defense against reinfection by attacking infected cells and communicating with immune cells. population seems to depend on the virus and its preferred location. reliance on antigen or the tissue microenvironment may affect CD4 TRM retention. reliance on antigen or the tissue microenvironment may affect CD4 TRM retention. CD103 Binds to E-cadherin VSV: 90% LCMV: 60% MCMV: 40% MuPyV, T. Gondii: 40\u201360% WNV: 20% [11,19,51,52,53,54] CD69 Antagonizes S1PR1 expression VSV, LCMV: >80% MCMV: 60% MuPyV, T. Gondii: 30\u201350% WNV: 20\u201330% [11,58, a comparison of CD103+ and CD103 CD8 bTRM to splenic CD103 CD8 T cells revealed increased effector activity and differential regulation of chemokine and cytokine genes. there is speculation that CD103+ and CD103 CD8 bTRM may have different functions. PD-1 expression on CD8 bTRM PD-1 expression is traditionally considered a marker of T cell exhaustion. PD-1 expression on CD8 bTRM PD-1 expression is traditionally considered a marker of T cell exhaustion. brain CD8 T cells express PD-1 during muPyV infection. memory CD8 T cells in the spleen do not, despite similar viral loads. PD-1 expression was independent of viral dose or inflammatory status. high expressions of PD-1 and engagement of the PD-1 pathway promotes CD8 bTRM differentiation and maintenance. PD-1 expression on CD8 TRM promotes the maintenance of CD8 T cells, improves viral control, and restrains inflammation. PD-1 expression on CD8 TRM promotes the maintenance of CD8 T cells, improves viral control, and protects the tissue from extensive damage. muPyV-infected glial cells expressed high levels of PD-L1. this suggests that infected glial cells may directly affect differentiation of CD8 bTRM through engagement of PD-1. however, no direct interaction between PD-L1+ glial cells and PD-1+ CD8 T cells has been reported. the exact mechanism by which CD4 T cells help CD8 T cells become CD8 bTRM is unknown. IL-21 from CD4 T cells binds IL21R on CD8 T cells to induce CD8 TRM differentiation. IL-21-/- mice had fewer IFN-producing CD4 and CD8 T cells during brain T. gondii infection. a loss of IFN from CD4 T cells was associated with a reduced frequency of virus-specific CD8 T cells localized to the airway epithelium following influenza infection. il-21 and IFN may also directly affect CD8 TRM differentiation. the differentiation and maintenance of CD8 TRM may also depend on the tissue microenvironment. memory CD8 T cells favor oxidative phosphorylation for their maintenance. not all CD8 TRM require TGF, as shown by the development and maintenance of a TGFR-deficient CD103 TRM population in the gut following Yersinia pseudotuberculosis infection. cells in the surrounding tissue parenchyma and immune cells can secrete these cytokines, especially TGF. differentiation occurs in an antigen-independent manner in most non-lymphoid tissues, such as the gut, female reproductive tract, and brain. antigen-experienced CD8 T cells recruited from the periphery do not displace original CD8 TRM, thus ensuring durable protection in tissues prone to reinfection [97,98]. circulating antigen-experienced CD8 T cells recruited from the periphery do not displace the original CD8 TRM, thus ensuring durable protection in tissues prone to reinfection. CD8 bTRM-mediated control of LCMV and HSV-1 reinfection exhibited minimal neuropathology, unlike the extensive immunopathology that resulted from the infiltration of circulating memory CD8 T cells from the periphery [24,51,102]. these studies demonstrate that CD8 bTRM are essential for long-term protection against viral infections in the brain."}
