{"summary": "interferon-induced transmembrane gene family (Ifitm) consists of four genes in humans and five in the mouse that encode very similar proteins of 40\u201360 residues. each protein consists of a unique extracellular N-terminus, a highly conserved transmembrane domain, and equally well-conserved hydrophilic (cytoplasmic) domain followed by a much more diverse transmembrane-like domain. a number of models have been proposed to describe the function of Ifitm3 in providing resistance to cellular infections including building a protein lattice in the membrane to block endosomal exit. the mouse Ifitm gene family encompasses about 65,000bp on mouse chromosome 7. this section of the chromosome has been removed by LoxP mediated deletion to create the IfitmDel animal. IfitmDel mice were backcrossed for more than 10 generations to the C57BL/6 strain. background- and age-matched littermates were used as WT controls. mice were fed ad libitum with normal chow. Ifitm6 (NM_001033632.1), NPY (NM_023456.2), POMC (NM_023456.2), TNF (NM-013693), IFN (NM_010510), Ifit1 (NM_008331), iNOS (NM_010927) IL-10 (NM_010548) IL-1 (NM_008361), F4/80 (NM_010130) and actin (M12866.1). epididymal fat pads were dissected from animal and fixed immediately in 4% paraformaldeyde in PBS overnight at 4\u00b0C. next day, tissues were dehydrated with serial alcohol solutions (50%, 70% and 100%) at room temperature for 2 hours each. tissue was then infiltrated in Immuno-bed resin (Polyscience, Inc.) at room temperature overnight. brain tissues were embedded in 2% gelatin (Sigma\u2013Aldrich) sectioned at 10m with the Thermo Scientific HM 550 Cryostat (ThermoFisher Scientific) sections were permeabilized with 0.02% Triton (Sigma) and stained with Iba1 (Abcam), F4/80 (eBioscience), CD11b (eBioscience), GFAP (Abcam), O2A (Abcam) and MAP-2 (in blood levels were measured at indicated time points by FreeStyle Lite blood glucose monitoring system. blood samples were obtained from tail bleeds. energy expenditure and locomotor activity were analyzed by indirect colorimetry. epididymal fat pads were dissected from animal and fixed immediately in 4% paraformaldeyde in PBS overnight at 4\u00b0C. tissue was dehydrated with serial alcohol solutions (50%, 70% and 100% at room temperature for 2 hours each. Tissues were moved to fresh Immuno-bed resin with catalyst (Polyscience, Inc.) at 1:25 ratio and polymerized in the mold at room temperature overnight. sections were adhered to microscope slides and proceed to H&E staining according to manufacturer's instructions. BMDM were isolated and cultured using standard protocols. cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.02% Triton (Sigma) and stained with Iba1. results The IfitmDel animals demonstrate enhanced adiposity. IfitmDel: Shown is the representative weight of wild-type (n = 10\u201322 per point) and IfitmDel (n = 4\u201316 per point) both are in the C57BL/6 genetic background. IfitmDel mice develop metabolic dysfunction. blood glucose of 2 and 9-month old WT and IfitmDel mice were measured at 10 AM (fasted) or 10 PM (fed) the same trends were observed with female IfitmDel animals. the IfitmDel animals have elevated levels of serum leptin. the leptin cytokine is critical in regulating appropriate food uptake. this level of food intake is significantly less than observed with ob/ob or db/db mice. RNA was isolated from the hypothalamus of WT young (2 months) or older (12 month) mice. transcript levels of Ifitm1, Ifitm2, Ifitm3 and Ifitm6 were then determined using quantitative PCR as described in methods. mc gene whose expression is increased upon leptin signaling while the transcription of the neuropeptide y (npy) gene is depressed. bio-active peptides from the Pomc protein dampen eating while those of Npy have the opposite effect and promote food intake. IfitmDel animals have significantly reduced Pomc transcripts than WT. 8 week old WT animals treated with Poly I:C over a time course of 28 days showed the expected progressive weight loss. but age and sex matched IfitmDel animals were much more resistant to the cachexic effects of the poly I:C treatment. animals were treated with poly I:C for 10 days (treatment every two days) weighed and analyzed. the increased level of F4/80 RNA in the hypothalamus of the poly I:C treated IfitmDel animals could be for a number of reasons including enhanced recruitment of blood monocytes/macrophages to that anatomic site. similar analyses were performed with RNA obtained from abdominal fat pads. in total these cytokine profiles suggest the response to interferon induced by the poly I:C treatment is intact but much more polarized towards a pro-inflammatory signature in the If transcripts from the same sample as in panel B show varied responses of: (C) TNF; (D) IL-1; (E) IFN; (F) iNOS; (G) IL-10; and (H) F4/80. morphology of the hypothalamus has not been examined in depth in the IfitmDel mice. the altered microglia morphology of the IfitmDel mice was evident in other brain regions including the cortex and hippocampus. microglia are mesoderm/mesenchymal derivatives that share a bone-marrow macrophage lineage. after 10 days, cells were gently rinsed with PBS and immunostained to reveal Iba1 expression. ohistochemical examination of sections prepared from saline perfused and paraformaldehyde fixed brains stained for the expression of the microglial marker, Iba1 (red) are shown. arrow heads point to typical appearance of (A) microglia in the Ifitm wild-type (WT) mice or (B) IfitmDel mouse. dotted lines indicate extending processes of microglia seen in the Ifitm wild-type (WT poly I:C treatment of WT and IfitmDel animals stimulates accumulation of Iba1/CD11b positive cells (Fig 6C and 6D; i.e., macrophages) in the choroid plexus. a notable difference in the response of the WT compared to the poly I:C treated mice was evident in choroid plexus structures. microglia accumulation in the choroid plexus differs in IfitmDel mice treated with poly I:C. sections of the indicated genotype were prepared from the brains of mice treated with either PBS or Poly I:C (12.5mg/kg) injection as indicated. IfitmDel mice demonstrate enhanced adiposity. no coding sequences or regulatory sequences other than those associated with the Ifitm genes are known to be lost in this deletion.

IfitmDel mice develop metabolic dysfunction. blood glucose of 2- and 9-month old WT and IfitmDel mice were measured at 10 AM (fasted) or 10 PM (fed) the same trends were observed with female IfitmDel animals. l animal in the cage trended towards less than the WT in the 12 month age group. the IfitmDel animals possess elevated levels of serum leptin. the leptin cytokine is critical in regulating appropriate food uptake. this level of food intake is significantly less than observed with the ob/ob or db/db mice. RNA was isolated from the hypothalamus of WT young (2 months) or older (12 month) mice. the transcript levels of Ifitm1, Ifitm2, Ifitm3 and Ifitm6 were then determined using quantitative PCR. transcript levels of POMC or NPY were analyzed in similar manner. ifitmDel mice showed altered responses to chronic type I interferon induction chronic poly I:C treatment, via activation of Tlr3 and the RIG-I-like receptors. ifitmDel mice showed altered responses to chronic type I interferon induction chronic poly I:C treatment. age and sex matched IfitmDel animals showed the expected progressive weight loss. but age and sex matched IfitmDel animals were much more resistant to the cachexic effects of the poly I:C treatment. animals were treated with poly I:C for 10 days (treatment every two days) weighed and analyzed. the hypothalamus was removed by dissection and total RNA isolated. the increased level of F4/80 RNA in the hypothalamus of the poly I:C treated IfitmDel animals could be for a number of reasons including enhanced recruitment of blood monocytes/macrophages to that anatomic site. similar analyses were performed with RNA obtained from abdominal fat pads. in total these cytokine profiles suggest the response to interferon induced by the poly I:C treatment is intact but much more polarized towards a pro-inflammatory signature in the If immunohistochemistry of the morphology of the hypothalamus has not been examined in depth in the IfitmDel mice. we first assessed the hypothalamus in unstimulated mice using markers for microglia/macrophages (Iba1), astrocytes (GFAP), oligodendrocytes (O2A) and neurons (MAP2) the altered microglia morphology of the IfitmDel mice was evident in other brain regions including the cortex and hippocampus. microglia are mesoderm/mesenchymal derivatives that share a bone-marrow macrophage lineage. after 10 days, cells were rinsed with PBS, cells fixed with paraformaldehyde and immunostained to reveal Iba1 expression. arrow heads point to typical appearance of (A) microglia in the Ifitm wild-type (WT) mice or (B) IfitmDel mouse. Dotted lines indicate extending processes of microglia seen in IfitmDel mouse sections. bar = 30 microns. (C,D) increased magnification of individual microglia as marked by an arrow head. poly I:C treatment of WT and IfitmDel animals stimulates accumulation of Iba1/CD11b positive cells (Fig 6C and 6D; i.e., macrophages) in the choroid plexus. a notable difference in the response of the WT compared to the poly I:C treated mice was evident in choroid plexus structures. microglia accumulation in the choroid plexus differs in IfitmDel mice treated with poly I:C. sections of the indicated genotype were prepared from the brains of mice treated with either PBS or Poly I:C (12.5mg/kg) injection as indicated. increased accumulation of either Iba1/CD11b or Iba1/F4/80 cells are found in the PolyI:C treated IfitmDel mice. 3V = third ventricle. alterations associated with lack of the Ifitm proteins. our preliminary analyses of the Stat3 signaling pathways in the IfitmDel animals revealed no difference with WT animals. further, other signaling systems that require Stat3 activation such as the IL-6 receptor is similar in IfitmDel splenocytes to that of WT-responses. however, the elevated expression of certain inflammatory cytokines such as TNF, which is often associated with cachexia and weight loss, require further exploration. altered microglia cell morphology could specifically affect leptin signaling and the production of neuropeptides such as Pomc or Npy is not known. however, it is possible that IfitmDel microglia are unable to produce normal interactions with other cells types including neurons and astrocytes. nal dysfunctions or inflammation in certain brain regions may also be linked to metabolic disorders. activation of microglia in addition to astrocytes can worsen disease progression by secreting excessive inflammatory cytokines. metabolic syndrome phenotypes characterized by weight gain and/or leptin resistance. the microglia deficiency seen in the IfitmDel animal is due to the lack of Ifitm6 during microglial cell development. other possibilities such as the indirect regulation of other modulators of adipose cell signaling by Ifitm will need to be investigated."}
