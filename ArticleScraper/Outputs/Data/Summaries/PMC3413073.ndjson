{"summary": "a total of 8096 cases and 774 deaths were reported. about 20% of patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) x-rays revealed bilateral diffuse consolidation. oligo-microarrays were used to profile the expression of immune function-related genes in monocytes/macrophages. the expression of immune function-related genes in SARS-CoV-infected monocytes/macrophages has never been revealed. the cell line was maintained in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) the cells were seeded in 15-mL TPP culture tubes at a density of 1106 cells/mL. the infectivities of SARS-CoV TW1 and CoV-229E were compared and they were comparable. RNA extraction Total RNA was extracted from uninfected, coV-229E-infected, and SARS-CoV-infected THP-1-DC-SIGN cells. a total of 19,137 oligos were used in the microarrays. the samples were labeled with cyanine 3-dUTP (Cyt3), and cyanine 5-dUTP (Cyt5). the samples were then mixed with 1 L of human Cot1-DNA (10 g/L), polyA (8\u201310 g/L) and yeast tRNA (4 g/L) each. the sample mixture was then denatured at 100\u00b0C for 1 min. all the data was uploaded to the US National Cancer Institute Microarray Website. the transformed numerical data, with gene annotations, were then downloaded from the website. if the data were still inconsistent, they were excluded from further analysis. genes that are immune response related were selected in the pathway analysis. red and green colors denote upregulation and downregulation. straight lines with blunt ends indicate downregulation from upstream gene A to downstream gene B. cytopathic effects were assessed 3 d later.

SARS-CoV infection of monocytes creates a hypoxic environment, which induces the expression of hypoxia-related genes. a microarray analysis of PBMCs of patients recovering from SARS revealed that SARS-CoV infection causes a general suppression of gene expression, and induces the upregulation of several specific ESTs and eosinophil-derived neurotoxins. a different study showed that interferon-/ signaling fails to occur in macrophages after SARS-CoV infection (9). downregulation or null expression of IFN-/-related genes is significant as a pathogenic mechanism of SARS-CoV. TLR7 was recently shown to appear on the endosomal membrane, and is an intracellular receptor for single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) myD88-independent CD14 signaling is upregulated after SARS-CoV infection. monocytic CD14 signaling is usually activated in the LPS reaction to bacteria. this means that SARS-CoV fails to initiate an antiviral interferon response, and may induce ineffective antibacterial immunity. monocytes/macrophages process antigens through the activities of cathepsins and proteasomes, and present antigens via chaperon/MHC molecules. it is interesting that SARS-CoV infection downregulates all the cathepsin and proteasome genes, and most of the chaperon/MHC genes. pathway network analysis showed that many genes that upregulate CXCL8/IL-8 were upregulated after SARS-CoV infection. this includes C/EBP delta, CD14, and complement C3 (11,42,59,62). Interestingly, alanyl aminopeptidase (ANPEP, Fig. 2) was downregulated after SARS-CoV infection. the relationship between leukotriene and lung fibrosis has been demonstrated in mice deficient in 5-lipoxygenase. no increase of inflammatory cells in the lungs was noted in knockout mice, in contrast to wild-type mice, which have abundant leukocytes. reduced PGE2 levels in SARS patients may contribute to lung fibrosis. PDGF is a major fibroblast mitogen (61). therefore upregulation of PDGF receptor by SARS-CoV would result in fibroblast proliferation, neutrophil and monocyte infiltration, and worsened lung fibrosis. in/proteasome genes are downregulated; hypoxia/hyperoxia-related genes upregulated. TLR/TLR-signaling, cytokine/cytokine receptor-related, lysosome-related, MHC/chaperon-related, and fibrosis-related genes are differentially regulated. authors are grateful to mong-Hsien Tsai, Chang-Hsui Sun, Hang-Ni Lee, Hsang-"}
