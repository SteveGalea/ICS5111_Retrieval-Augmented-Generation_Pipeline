{"summary": "antigen-specific immunotherapy has emerged as an attractive approach for the treatment of cancers since it has the ability to specifically eradicate systemic tumors and control metastases without damaging normal cells. DNA vaccination has become a potentially promising approach for antigen-specific immunotherapy due to its safety, stability and ease of preparation. DMXAA is a synthetic flavonoid that induces the production of local cytokines including TNF. it has been shown to induce antitumor effects in animal models. it has demonstrated a good safety profile and has been shown promising in phase I clinical trials. FITC-conjugated rat anti-mouse CD4, CD8, IFN- and PE-conjugated anti-mouse CD8 antibodies were purchased from BD Pharmingen (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). 5,6-dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid (DMXAA) was dissolved in 5% sodium bicarbonate, and injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) at a dose of 20 mg/kg of body gene gun particle-mediated DNA vaccination was performed using a helium-driven gene gun. gold particles coated with pcDNA3 encoding HPV-16 E6 or HPV-16 E7 or PADRE were delivered to the shaved abdominal region of mice using a helium-driven gene gun. mice were vaccinated with 2 g of pcDNA3-CRT/E7 DNA. mice were treated with either 20 mg/kg of DMXAA or buffer via i.p. injection. 48 hours later, splenocytes were harvested and apoptosis of T cells analyzed. FITC-conjugated rat anti-mouse CD4, CD8, IFN- and PE-conjugated anti-mouse CD8 antibodies were purchased from BD Pharmingen (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) DMXAA was dissolved in 5% sodium bicarbonate, and injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) at a dose of 20 mg/kg of body weight. mouse tumor challenge model C57BL/6 mice were injected with 1 105 TC-1 tumor cells subcutaneously at the flank site in 100 L PBS. tumor volume was estimated using the formula 3.14 [largest diameter (perpendicular diameter)2]/6. pcDNA3 encoding HPV-16 E6 or HPV-16 E7 or PADRE was delivered to the shaved abdominal region of mice using a helium-driven gene gun. cells were stained with FITC-conjugated rat antimouse CD8a. intracellular IFN- was stained with FITC-conjugated rat antimouse IFN-. Flow cytometry analysis was performed using FACSCalibur with CELLQuest software. treatment with DMXAA generates significant therapeutic effects against TC-1 tumors but does not enhance the antigen-specific immune responses in tumor bearing mice. tumor bearing mice treated with DMXAA showed significantly lower tumor volumes over time compared to tumor bearing mice without DMXAA treatment. we harvested splenocytes from vaccinated mice and characterized them for the presence of E7-specific CD8+ T cells using intracellular cytokine staining for IFN- followed by flow cytometry analysis. the data are from one representative experiment of two performed. combination of DMXAA treatment with E7 DNA vaccination generates potent antitumor effects and E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses in the splenocytes of tumor-bearing XAA enhances the systemic E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses generated by CRT/E7 DNA vaccination. 5-8 weeks old C57BL/6 mice (5 per group) were challenged with 1 105 TC-1 tumor cells subcutaneously, and were either treated with DMXAA or left untreated as indicated. vaccinated mice treated with DMXAA 3 days after vaccination generated the best E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses compared to any of the other regimens. splenocytes were harvested from vaccinated mice and characterized for the presence of E7-specific CD8+ T cells using intracellular cytokine staining. splenocytes from tumor-bearing mice harvested and characterized for E7-specific CD8+ T cells using intracellular IFN- staining followed by flow cytometry analysis. one week after last vaccination, splenocytes from tumor-bearing mice were harvested and characterized for E7-specific CD8+ T cells using intracellular IFN- staining followed by flow cytometry analysis. 5-8 weeks old C57BL/6 mice were challenged with 1 105 TC-1 tumor cells subcutaneously, vaccinated with pcDNA3-CRT/E7 DNA vaccine via gene gun delivery and treated with DMXAA. one week after last vaccination, splenocytes from tumor-bearing mice were harvested and characterized for E7-specific CD8+ T cells. mice vaccinated with 3 different vaccines (CRT/E6 DNA or Sig/E7/L1 vaccinia virus or PADRE DNA vaccine via gene gun delivery and treated with DMXAA at 3 days before vaccination. one week after last vaccination, splenocytes from mice were harvested and characterized for antigen-specific T cell immune responses using intracellular IFN- staining. antigen-specific IFN+ CD4+ T cells per 3 105 splenocytes SEM following vaccination +/- DMXAA treatment. splenocytes from mice were harvested and treated with either one dose or two doses of DMXAA. administration of two doses of DMXAA after first CRT/E7 DNA vaccination generates significantly better E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses in vaccinated mice. vaccinated mice treated with DMXAA 3 days after the first vaccination generated significantly better memory T cell immune responses compared to vaccination without DMXAA treatment. splenocytes were harvested and characterized for the presence of E7-specific CD8+ T cells using intracellular cytokine staining for IFN- followed by flow cytometry analysis. cytokines IL-6, G-CSF, KC, MIP-1, MCP-1 and RANTES were found to be elevated in vaccinated mice treated with DMXAA compared to vaccinated mice without DMXAA treatment. these cytokines may potentially play a role in the enhancement of antigen-specific T cell immune responses caused by co-administration of DMXAA with the DNA vaccine. mouse cytokines were analyzed using bio-Plex Pro mouse Cytokine 23-plex Assay. each sample was assayed in duplicate. iNOS plays a role in the immune suppression caused by DMXAA administration at the time of the first DNA vaccination. mice were vaccinated with CRT/E7 DNA vaccine via gene gun delivery. mice were treated with DMXAA either at the time of first vaccination on D0 or 3 days after the first vaccination on D3. splenocytes from vaccinated mice were harvested and characterized for E7-specific CD8+ T cells using intracellular IFN- staining followed by flow cytometry analysis. 5-8 weeks old wild-type or iNOS deficient mice were vaccinated with pcDNA3-CRT/E7 via gene gun delivery at day 0, and boosted once at day 7. the mice were treated with DMXAA (20 mg/kg) via i.p. injection either at day 0 (A) or day 3 (D) of first vaccination. tumor bearing mice treated with DMXAA showed significantly lower tumor volumes over time compared to tumor bearing mice without DMXAA treatment. one week after DMXAA treatment, splenocytes from tumor-bearing mice were harvested and characterized for E7-specific CD8+ T cells using intracellular IFN- staining followed by flow cytometry analysis. however, as shown in Figure 1B, we found that treatment with DMXAA generates significant therapeutic effects against TC-1 tumor representative data of intracellular cytokine staining followed by flow cytometry analysis showing the number of E7-specific IFN+ CD8+ T cells in after DMXAA treatment. the results suggest that treatment of tumor-bearing mice with DMXAA enhances the systemic E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses. 5-8 weeks old C57BL/6 mice (5 per group) were challenged with 1 105 TC-1 tumor cells subcutaneously. were either vaccinated with pcDNA3-CRT/E7 DNA vaccine or control vectors. splenocytes from tumor-bearing mice were harvested and characterized for E7-specific CD8+ T cells. vaccinated mice treated with DMXAA 3 days after vaccination generated the best E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses compared to any of the other regimens. vaccinated mice treated with DMXAA at the time of vaccination or 3 days before the first vaccination generated suppressed E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses in tumor-bearing mice. C57BL/6 mice (5 per group) were challenged with TC-1 tumor cells subcutaneously, vaccinated with pcDNA3-CRT/E7 DNA vaccine via gene gun delivery. one week after last vaccination, splenocytes from tumor-bearing mice were harvested and characterized for E7-specific CD8+ T cells. splenocytes from tumor-bearing mice were harvested and characterized for E7-specific CD8+ T cells per 3 105 splenocytes SEM following DNA vaccination +/- DMXAA treatment. the increased number and function of DCs contribute to the enhanced processing and presentation of E7 antigen to the generation of E7-specific CD8+ T cells in treated mice. one week after last vaccination, splenocytes from mice were harvested and characterized for antigen-specific T cell immune responses using intracellular IFN- staining followed by flow cytometry analysis. one week after last vaccination, splenocytes from mice were harvested and characterized for (A) HPV-16 E6-specific CD8+ T cell responses, (B) HPV-16 E7/L1 vaccinia virus or PADRE DNA responses. C. Bar graph depicts the number of antigen-specific IFN+ CD4+ T cells per 3 105 splenocytes SEM following vaccination +/- DMXAA treatment. in order to determine if additional doses of DMXAA following the first vaccination would further enhance the immune responses generated in vaccinated mice. vaccinated mice treated with DMXAA 3 days after first vaccination generated significantly better E7-specific CD8+ memory T cell immune responses compared to vaccination without DMXAA treatment. splenocytes were harvested and characterized for the presence of E7-specific CD8+ T cells using intracellular cytokine staining for IFN- followed by flow cytometry analysis. co-administration of DMXAA with DNA vaccine leads to elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines in the serum of treated mice. cytokines IL-6, G-CSF, KC, MIP-1, MCP-1 and RANTES were found to be elevated in vaccinated mice treated with DMXAA compared to vaccinated mice without DMXAA treatment. apoptosis of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in splenocytes derived from mice treated with DMXAA. mice treated with DMXAA have been shown to induce iNOS production. iNOS and TNF have been implicated in playing an important role in antitumor immunity. splenocytes from vaccinated mice were harvested and characterized for E7-specific CD8+ T cells using intracellular IFN- staining followed by flow cytometry analysis. iNOS is a major factor in the immunosuppression mediated by DMXAA when administered at the time of the first DNA vaccination. vaccinated iNOS-/- mice treated with DMXAA on D0 suppressed the E7-specific CD8+ T cell C57BL/6 mice were vaccinated with pcDNA3-CRT/E7 via gene gun delivery at day 0 or day 3 (D) of the first vaccination. the mice were treated with DMXAA (20 mg/kg) via i.p. injection. treatment of tumor-bearing mice with DMXAA alone leads to therapeutic antitumor effects without generating antigen-specific immune responses. this may be due to the fact that as a vascular disrupting agent, DMXAA exert antitumor effects by non antigen-specific mechanisms such as selectively destroying the established tumor vasculature and shutting down blood supply to solid tumors. DMXAA administered after the first DNA vaccination influences the cytokine profile in the serum of mice with observed immune enhancement. mice treated with DMXAAA showed upregulation of the cytokines IL-6, G-CSF, KC, MIP-1 and RANTES. IL-6 can be secreted by T cells and macrophages to stimulate immune response to trauma, leading to inflammation. it will be of interest to further characterize the role of iNOS on immunosuppression mediated by DMXAA treatment. the combination of DMXAA treatment with HPV-16 E7 DNA vaccination can enhance or suppress the antitumor effects. these results may have potential implications for future clinical translation. 5-8 weeks old C57BL/6 mice were vaccinated with pcDNA3-CRT/E7 DNA vaccine via gene gun delivery and treated with either one or two doses of DMXAA. bar graph representing the percentage of CD11c+CD45+ DCs. ** indicated p 0.001. the data shown here are from one representative experiment of two performed. click here for file (2.9MB, TIFF) Acknowledgements This work was supported by R21 AI085380, P20 CA118770, 1 RO1 CA114425 01."}
