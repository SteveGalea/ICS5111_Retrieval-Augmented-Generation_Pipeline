{"summary": "pigs were humanely euthanized and necropsied at 28 dpi. pigs were humanely euthanized and necropsied at 28 dpi. microtiter plates were coated with 0.44 ng per well (100 l) of the S1 antigen diluted in coating buffer and incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C. plates were used immediately after blocking or dried at 37 \u00b0C for 2\u20134 h and stored at 4 \u00b0C until use. secondary antibody incubation a. was added to each well and incubate at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min. second incubation using substrate a. TMB substrate (100 l; SureBlueTM TMB Microwell Peroxidase Substrate Kit, KPL Inc.) ISA were obtained from a pig infected experimentally with PEDV. pigs were inoculated with 10 ml of the 5th passage of PEDV isolate 13-19338E. pigs were humanely euthanized and necropsied at 28 dpi. microtiter plates were coated with 0.44 ng per well (100 l) of the antigen. plates were incubated with blocking buffer for 2 h at 22 \u00b0C. plates were used immediately after blocking or dried at 37 \u00b0C for 2\u20134 h. third incubation using substrate a. TMB substrate (100 l; SureBlueTM TMB Microwell Peroxidase Substrate Kit, KPL Inc.) was added to each well and incubated at 22 \u00b0C for 20 min in the dark. reaction stopped by addition of 50 l of 2 M sulphuric acid solution per well. the secondary antibody (100 l) was added to each well and incubate at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min. the reaction was stopped by addition of 50 l of 2 M sulphuric acid solution per well. the cut off value for the IgA ELISA was calculated by the mean S/P ratios of PEDV negative samples plus three standard deviations (SD) the cut off points were determined to be a sample S/P ratio of 0.13 (average S/P SD, 0.02 0.03) and sample S/P ratio of 0.14 (average S/P SD, 0.00 0.01) for the serum ELISA. PEDV is a member of the genus Alphacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae. it causes acute diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration in neonatal piglets. PEDV infection has resulted in high economic losses in Asian pig industries. a previous study has shown that anti-PEDV IgA antibodies in serum samples correlated with protection against a subsequent challenge 21 days after the first inoculation. in veterinary diagnostics, serum is a standard sample for serological testing; however, testing fecal samples may allow a better assessment of local immunity."}
