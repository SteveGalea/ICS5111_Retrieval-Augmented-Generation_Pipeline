{"summary": "honey bees are essential pollinators of agriculturally important crops including apples, almonds, alfalfa, and citrus. current agricultural practices demand a seasonal abundance of honey bees in geographic locations incapable of maintaining sufficient pollinator populations year-round. ing viruses are positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses of the Picornavirales order. they include acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV) [12], black queen cell virus (BQCV) [13], Israeli acute bee paralysis virus (IAPV) [14], Kashmir bee virus (KBV) [15], deformed wing virus (CBPV), swollen yellow larva and/or dark-brown larva carcasses in the cells of worker-be cophaera apis, the causative agent of Chalkbrood disease, kills infected larvae, but does not typically cause colony loss. microbial infections, mite infestation also weakens and kills honey bee colonies. honey bees from 20 colonies were consistently sampled beginning with the introduction of a new queen in April 2009 (Mississippi (MS), through transport to summer foraging grounds in south Dakota (SD), and transfer to California (CA) for almond pollination. arthropod pathogen microarray is a custom DNA microarray capable of detecting over 200 arthropod-infecting viruses, microbes, and metazoans. oligonucleotides represent every arthropod-infecting virus with published nucleic acid sequence in the international committee on taxonomy of Viruses database. a sample from a collapsed colony in Montana tested positive for the highest number of viruses (BQCV, DWV, KBV, IAPV) and documented the array's ability to simultaneously detect multiple pathogens. analysis of symptomatic honey bees confirmed the presence CBPV and DWV, respectively. 138 Birnavirus 12 Cypovirus 98 Densovirus 110 Iridovirus 46 Luteovirus 10 Nimavirus 68 Okavirus 10 Poxvirus 74 Rhabdovirus 10 Tetravirus 30 Totivirus 10 Unassigned Virus Families Total: 88 chronic bee paralysis virus 26 Solenopsis Invicta virus II 26 Acyrthospihon Pisum virus 12 Nora virus 12 kelp fly virus 12 Bacteria Total each hive was analyzed at a single time-point per month by species specific PCR. in April and May, N.apis was predominant whereas in June, July, and October through December, N. ceranae was exclusively detected. 75% of all colonies were infected with Nosema ceranae. viruses The APM readily detected common honey bee viruses in samples collected throughout the time-course. overall virus incidence was sporadic, which we attribute to cycles of acute infection in predominantly healthy monitor colonies. virus (ABPV), acute bee paralysis virus (IAPV), Kashmir bee virus (KBV), deformed virus (DWV) in each colony (5 bees per sample) were assessed by end-point PCR from a single time-point each month. the positive sample percentages in each pie-chart are indicated in red. four distinct novel viruses were discovered via deep sequencing. tBlastx screened contigs against non-redundant nucleotide database (NR) at an e-value threshold of 1105. the two viruses shared 97% nucleotide homology along 171 nt of the IRES. the high sequence similarity between this new isolate and canonical ALPV makes it unclear whether this is a novel species or a new strain of ALPV. incidence peaked in may, when 7 out of 20 hives were infected. twenty-eight incidences of BSRV were detected from 197 time-course samples by specific PCR. peak abundance was 7.64103 copies per 100 ng of RNA sample. peak abundance was 7.64103 copies per 100 ng of RNA sample. both LSV genomes display similarities to the RNA1 molecule of chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV) with predicted open reading frames (ORFs) of similar size and arrangement. LSV1 and 2 ORFs are contained on a single RNA rather than in the bipartite configuration of CBPV. lake Sinai virus strain 1 (LSV1; HQ871931), lake Sinai virus strain 2 (LSV2: HQ888865), chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV; NC010711), boolarra virus (BoV; NC004142), nodamura virus (NoV; nov; NC002690), barfin flounder nodavirus BF93Hok (BFV; NC011063), grapevine Algerian latent virus (GALV; LSV1 and 2 share 70% amino acid identity over the capsid. the capsid overlaps the RdRp gene in the +1 reading frame for 125 nt. the LSV2 capsid is separated by 18 nt without a redundant stop codon. seven of twenty hives sampled on august 5, 2009 were positive for LSV1. cDNA synthesis reactions were performed using tagged negative strand-specific LSV1 and 2 primers followed by exonuclease I digestion of excess unincorporated RT-primers. PCR amplification using a tag-specific forward primer and LSV-specific reverse primers confirmed the presence of the replicative forms of both LSV1 and LSV2 in the July RNA sample. PCR retrieved 593 nt of the GAPDH gene to confirm phylogenetic placement. DAPI stained kinetoplast DNA (yellow arrow) and nuclear DNA (white arrow), as well as the flagellar pocket (bottom panel, red arrow); scale bar = 5 m. the features observed by microscopy (flagella and kinetoplast) and phylogenetic analysis unambiguously identify this species taxonomically. we have deposited the GADPH sequence (JF423199) for future molecular identification. additional oligonucleotides complementary to the C. mellificae rRNA and kinetoplast sequence were designed and included on the APM beginning in October 2009. a close relative of the genus Mycoplasma, are bacterial parasites that have been implicated as pathogens of insects, vertebrates and plants. spiroplasma and pan-mycoplasma PCRs targeting the 16S rRNA gene detected sporadic infections over most of the time-points. pooled monthly samples were weakly positive for Apocephalus borealis in December and January. two individual hive samples produced robust amplicons. phorid rRNA sequences from our time-course shared 99% similarity to honey bee-parasitizing phorids. us plutonius bacterial species [53] were represented on the microarray. sensitivity of the APM was estimated to be 1.9105 viral genome copies (1 pg Drosophila C virus in vitro transcribed genomic RNA) sensitivity was confirmed by performing pathogen-specific PCRs in conjunction with nucleic acid sequencing. in total we detected and sequence confirmed ten previously characterized honey bee pathogens using the array including: CBPV, IAPV, DWV, ABPV, BQCV, SBV, KBV, Nosema apis, N. ceranae and Varroa destructor. 264 acute bee paralysis virus 38 black queen cell virus 42 Israeli acute paralysis virus 26 Kashmir bee virus 42 other Dicistroviruses 116 Iflavirus Total: 1 temporary monitoring of 20 migratory honey bee colonies. prospectively collected 10-month time-course of 431 data points. each consisting of 50\u2013100 bees isolated separately from the entrance and brood comb (younger house bees) nosema ceranae and nosema apis incidence assessed by species-specific end-point PCR from a single time-point (n = 20) each month. the positive sample percentages in each pie-chart are indicated in red. a single virus was detected in multiple colonies at a given time-point. qPCR analysis of pooled monthly samples confirmed and extended APM findings. BQCV, SBV and ABPV levels peaked in mid-summer to early fall. novel virus reached the highest copy number observed in this study in January 2010 (1.42109 copies per 100 ng of RNA sample; approximately 7.11011 copies per bee); note the y-axes on each graph are independently scaled. four distinct novel viruses were discovered via deep sequencing. sequences from four novel viruses were recovered and Sanger validated. these include two members of Dicistroviridae, and two RNA viruses distantly related to Nodaviridae. the recovered sequence aligned with 83% nucleotide and 89% amino acid identity to the canonical ALPV genome. four contigs of size 1473, 861, 1164 and 1311 nt (GenBank JF423195-8) derived from the non-structural region, the IRES, and the capsid gene. this level of amino acid divergence is consistent with the taxonomic rank of a new species. both contigs were confirmed by specific PCR and Sanger sequencing. the first contig represents a novel RNA virus that we designate Lake Sinai virus (HQ871931), after Lake Sinai in Brookings County, south Dakota. the second contig also represented a related, yet divergent, RNA virus which we designated Lake Sinai virus 2 (HQ888865) both LSV RdRp genes have the DxSRFD and SG amino acid motifs in the NTP binding pocket (residues 375\u2013380 and 436\u2013437 in LSV1) conserved between the families Nodaviridae,Tombusviridae and CBPV. capsids of LSV1 and 2 are encoded on the same RNA as Orf1 and the RdRp unlike that of CBPV. similarity to tetravirus capsid genes consistently outranked similarity to CBPV or nodavirus capsids. LSV1 copy number peaked in July, at 1.39108 copies per 100 ng of RNA sample (approximately 7.01010 copies per bee) notably, LSV2 was the most abundant virus detected in this study (1011 copies per bee) cDNA synthesis reactions were performed using negative-strand specific RT-PCR to detect the replicative forms of both LSV1 and LSV2. oligonucleotides from these two distantly related organisms predicted to hybridize to all other Crithidia species with published sequence. three oligonucleotides and their reverse complements derived from Crithidia oncopelti were repeatedly detected in samples throughout the time-course. honey bee intestines were dissected in a sterile environment from which Crithidia mellificae was cultured. light microscopy of these parasites enabled visualization of the flagella and motility. previous studies describing trypanosomatids in honey bees lacked DNA-sequencing data. C. mellificae was readily detected in pooled monthly RNA samples by qPCR throughout the year. despite peak levels in late summer and early fall, peak trypanosomatid levels occurred in January 2010. despite this, C. mellificae infections statistically associated with N. ceranae infections (Chi Square p = 0.004, OR = 3.1) phorid flies have previously been associated with bumble bee parasitism. they are well-characterized parasites of ants and other insects. they lay eggs inside the insect hosts, which are consumed by the larvae during development. nearly every colony was infected during a surge in August and September. in April and May, N.apis was predominant whereas in June, July, and October through December, N. ceranae was exclusively detected. 75% of all colonies were infected with Nosema ceranae. 69 virus incidences in 63 of 431 total samples. overall virus incidence was sporadic, which we attribute to cycles of acute infection in predominantly healthy monitor colonies. sacbrood virus (SBV), black queen cell virus (BQCV), acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV), Kashmir bee virus (KBV), deformed virus (DWV) were assessed by end-point PCR from a single time-point each month. the positive sample percentages in each pie-chart are indicated in red. four distinct novel viruses were discovered via deep sequencing. tBlastx screened short contigs against the non-redundant nucleotide database. the two viruses shared 97% nucleotide homology along 171 nt of the IRES. the high sequence similarity between this new isolate and canonical ALPV makes it unclear whether this is a novel species or a new strain of ALPV. twenty-eight incidences of BSRV were detected from 197 time-course samples. peak abundance was 7.64103 copies per 100 ng of RNA sample. peak abundance was 7.64103 copies per 100 ng of RNA sample. both LSV genomes display similarities to the RNA1 molecule of chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV) with predicted open reading frames (ORFs) of similar size and arrangement. LSV1 and 2 ORFs are contained on a single RNA rather than in the bipartite configuration of CBPV. phylogeny of the nodavirales superfamily. tetravirus capsid genes consistently outranked similarity to tetravirus capsids. the LSV1 capsid overlaps the RdRp gene in the +1 reading frame for 125 nt before ending in a pair of stop codons. the LSV2 capsid overlaps the RdRp gene in the +1 reading frame for 125 nt before ending in a pair of stop codons (separated by two residues) cDNA synthesis reactions were performed using tagged negative strand-specific LSV1 and 2 primers followed by exonuclease I digestion of excess unincorporated RT-primers. PCR amplification using a tag-specific forward primer and LSV-specific reverse primers confirmed the presence of the replicative forms of both LSV1 and LSV2 in the July RNA sample. PCR retrieved 593 nt of the GAPDH gene to confirm phylogenetic placement. previous studies describing trypanosomatids in honey bees lacked DNA-sequencing data. osomal RNA that was too conserved between trypanosomatids for precise taxonomic assignment. phylogenetic analysis and microscopy unambiguously identify this species. additional oligonucleotides complement the C. mellificae rRNA and kinetoplast sequence were designed and included on the APM beginning in October 2009. spiroplasma melliferum and S. apis are bacterial parasites that have been implicated as pathogens of insects, vertebrates and plants. spiroplasma infections had strong associations with N. ceranae and C. mellificae (p = 0.000076, OR = 16.3) pooled monthly samples were weakly positive for Apocephalus borealis. two individual hive samples produced robust amplicons. phorid rRNA sequences from our time-course shared 99% similarity to honey bee-parasitizing phorids captured in San Francisco. nosema infection was prevalent in our 20 monitor colonies. N. ceranae abundance peaked in early-spring and late-summer. lower N. ceranae levels from November to January likely reflects antifungal treatments. ae found no correlation between colony loss and Nosema infection. standardized molecular biology-based monitoring of large sample cohorts is required to understand the dynamics of Nosema infection. this report highlights the importance of further characterizing the epidemiology and pathogenicity of Nosema. increased brood rearing during the summer results in a greater number of bees capable of transmitting pathogens to other members of the colony living in very close proximity. increased brood rearing during the summer results in a greater number of bees capable of transmitting pathogens to other members of the colony living in close proximity. we did not observe either increased incidence or abundance of any of the microbes and viruses monitored in our study after long distance transport. the colonies in our study cleared or reduced IAPV infection to levels below detection within one week, indicative of a mild infection. DWV-specific PCR of pooled monthly time-course samples was negative. DWV-specific PCR of pooled monthly time-course samples was negative. lack of DWV in our monitor colonies is consistent with low Varroa destructor incidence. the presence of viral nucleic acid does not necessarily indicate infection, as pollen pellets of infected and non-infected workers are known to harbor honey bee viruses. the enormous magnitude of LSV throughout the time-course suggests that these are bona fide honey bee viruses. the effects of C. mellificae on the honey bee host remain relatively uncharacterized compared to those of C. bombi on bumble bee. the importance of honey bees in agriculture underscores the need to monitor honey bee associated viruses and microbes in healthy colonies over time. our discovery and genomic characterization of four new viruses will facilitate future monitoring. Temporal characterization of these and the other microbes described herein offers a more complete view of the possible microbe-microbe and microbe-environment interactions. further studies examining any subtle or combinatorial effects of these novel microbes are required to understand their role in colony health. honey bee colonies were periodically supplemented with sugar syrup and protein supplement. in April and October colonies received 3 gallons of a 11 mixture of high fructose corn syrup-55 (HFCS-55, 55% fructose, 42% glucose) and sucrose syrup. this operation experienced an average 18% colony loss from November 2009 to February 2010. honey bee samples, 5 bees per colony each time-point, were homogenized in 1 mL 50% TRIzol Reagent (Sigma) and 50% phosphate buffered saline (PBS, UCSF Cell Culture) solution. RNA was isolated according to TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) manufacturer's instructions. array oligonucleotides were selected for uniqueness against an insect nucleic acid background, for 50% GC content to maintain high complexity and for cross-reactivity of highly-conserved nucleic acid features with evolutionarily related targets. each oligonucleotide and its reverse complement were printed twice for redundancy. one-quarter of the random priming reaction is used in a 50 LTaq PCR reaction for 25 cycles with a single primer (5\u2032GTTTCCCACTGGAGGATA) samples were purified with the Zymo DNA Clean and Concentrator (Zymo) and resuspended in a buffer of 3 SSC, 50 mM HEPES and 0.5% SDS.
