{"summary": "corticosteroid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) was associated with high doses of corticosteroids. the incidence of corticosteroid-induced ONFH was associated with high doses of corticosteroids. underlying diseases in certain predisposed individuals mainly occurred in the first 3 months of corticosteroid prescription. corticosteroid use is the most common cause of ONFH. the stage at diagnosis was earlier than those in other groups. the incidence of osteonecrosis was 6.7% with corticosteroid treatment of >2.0 g. corticosteroid-induced ONFH may require early detection and prevention of femoral head necrosis. the systemic use of corticosteroids as the gold standard treatment for many diseases is an independent factor for corticosteroid-induced ONFH. osteonecrosis is directly associated with the dose of steroids. long-acting corticosteroid use yielded a higher risk of ONFH. sporadic case reports on topical steroid application-induced ONFH. some studies attempted to reduce side effects of short-term and higher dose application of corticosteroids. a study involving 284 patients took statins and high doses of steroids at the same time reported a 1% incidence rate of ONFH. the study also confirmed the suppressive effects of simvastatin on plasminogen activator inhibitor-I (PAI-1) expression. patients with SLE have positive correlations with ONFH as an independent risk factor. underlying diseases and corticosteroid administration entail an increasing risk of ONFH. underlying diseases and corticosteroid administration entail an increasing risk. studies on specific types of gene variants more focused on single nucleotide polymorphism variant correlated with pathogenic hypotheses. inherited hypofibrinolysis proved to be a risk factor of idiopathic ONFH. inherited hypofibrinolysis was a risk factor of idiopathic ONFH. the development of ONFH depended on the response to a high dose of corticosteroid therapy and a decrease in the bone mineral density value in the 1st year. adolescent and adult patients had a significantly higher risk of osteonecrosis than pediatric patients. children who received dexamethasone had a higher incidence of skeletal morbidity than those treated with prednisolone. there were sporadic case reports on topical steroid application-induced ONFH. sporadic case reports on topical steroid application-induced ONFH. underlying diseases play as a significant risk factor in the development of osteonecrosis. underlying diseases singly or mutually result in osteonecrosis. patients with SLE have positive correlations with ONFH. the incidence of corticosteroid-induced osteonecrosis varies among different diseases. there are no exact criteria for association degree and specific risk stratification. there are no exact criteria for association degree and specific risk stratification. osteonecrosis was associated with inherited variations near glutamate receptor genes. there may be a genetic basis associated with the risk factor, which would determine the development of ONFH. patients using corticosteroids should be warned of the complication of ONFH. bone marrow edema on MRI should be considered as a marker for potential progression to advanced osteonecrosis. osteonecrosis could occur within 3 weeks after initiation of high-dose corticosteroid therapy. MRI evaluation may be useful in following up the progression of small asymptomatic lesions of ONFH in patients with SARS. asymptomatic osteonecrosis had a high prevalence of progression to symptomatic disease and femoral head collapse, while small, medially located lesions had a low rate of progression. the stage of ONFH and the time from discerning corticosteroid use to the diagnosis of ONFH are important factors in predicting its spontaneous regression. compared with the nonoperative management group, the core decompression group had a notable effect on the natural history and clinical progression in the early stages of ONFH. patients with high-risk factors should receive preventive methods and regular follow-up in the next 12 months and should be diagnosed early. serial MRI evaluation might be useful in following up the progression of small asymptomatic lesions of ONFH in patients with SARS. MRI also helps quantify the area and extent of ONFH in different planes and could also be used to guide treatments as a validated technique in following up patients. asymptomatic osteonecrosis had a high prevalence of progression to symptomatic disease and femoral head collapse, while small, medially located lesions had a low rate of progression. the stage of ONFH and the time from discerning corticosteroid use to the diagnosis of ONFH are important factors in predicting its spontaneous regression. conservative treatment Pharmacologic agents Bisphosphonate is initially used in the treatment of osteoporosis by decreasing osteoclastic activities while improving bone mass density. some physicians have attempted to treat osteonecrosis using bisphosphonates and accumulated some experiences. the most prioritized procedure is CD for early-stage ONFH. the technique is superior to nonoperative management. the ideal result is pain alleviation and bone regeneration and repair. nonvascularized bone grafting (NVBG) removes necrotic bones and replaces them with cancellous and/or cortical autografts. it rebuilds the structure of the femoral head and supports the subchondral bone and articular cartilage. osteotomy and porous tantalum rod aims to relocate the necrotic area of the bone from the weight loading area without the risk of autografting. osteotomy may increase surgical difficulty and reduce surgical effectiveness following end-stage arthroplasty. 83.9% of patients with early-stage ONFH (335 patients, 528 hips) were treated with shockwave therapy. the result showed significant improvements in the function of the affected hips and reduction in the BEM on MRI. medullary pressure inside the femoral head and improve blood flow in early-stage ONFH. the ideal result is pain alleviation and bone regeneration and repair. the technique is superior to nonoperative management. nonvascularized bone grafting (NVBG) removes necrotic bones and replaces them with cancellous and/or cortical autografts. it rebuilds the structure of the femoral head and supports the subchondral bone and articular cartilage to avoid collapse. this technique has evolved from the Phemister technique to the Trapdoor technique and lightbulb technique. osteotomy and porous tantalum rod Osteotomy aims to relocate the necrotic area of the bone without the risk of autografting. many studies reported promising clinical results with angular intertrochanteric or trans-trochanteric rotational osteotomy in ONFH. sion characteristics, patient factors, and preference of doctors. Surgical treatment showed better results than conservative therapy in earlier-stage ONFH. there should be a trend in minimizing surgical injury and evaluation of treatment."}
