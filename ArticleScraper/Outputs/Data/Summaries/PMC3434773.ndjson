HK1 isoform I, HK1 isoform II, KLHL7, KLHL12, and ZBTB2C1 are displayed. all of the extreme outliers beyond the 1.5 interquartile range + median are shown as black dots. positive rates for the other three members, OGDC-E2, PDC-E1, and PDC-E1, were only 8.4, 9.4 and 12.6%, respectively. HK1 isoform I (46.6%), HK1 isoform II (44.0%), Kelch-like protein 12 (KLHL12) (40.3%), Kelch-like protein 7 (KLHL7) (35.1%), zinc finger and BTB domain-containing protein 2 (ZBTB2) (16.8%), and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2C (eIF2C1) (15.2%). autoantigens were highly specific for PBC. we therefore surveyed their autoimmunity in 142 serum samples. all five antigens showed significantly reduced positive rates in both RA and SSc. all 934 cases were classified according to clinical diagnosis of PBC, AIH, HBV, HCV, RA, RA, SSc, and healthy. the observed positive detection rates for KLHL12 and ZBTB2 ELISA were 29.6 and 11.2%, respectively, slightly lower than the rates obtained with the microarray platform. recombinant HK1 isoform I and KLHL7 proteins purified from yeast and bacteria. HK1 and KLHL7 proteins were tagged with either the GST-His6 or His6 epitope. no significant signals were observed for the negative controls. AMA, including anti-M2 autoantibodies, are frequently detected in patients with other non-PBC autoimmune diseases (85), such as SLE (86, 87), AIH (19, 22), SSc (18), primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome (20), and even in some infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis (23) and viral hepatitis (21). arily conserved protein-protein interaction motif found in species ranging from flies to mammals (90, 91) it is often present at the N termini of zinc finger transcription factors. previous studies have suggested that the BTB/POZ domain is required for interaction with cullin-3 and for the formation of the ubiquitin-protein E3 ligase complex. ZBTB2 acts as a potent p21 transcription repressor, a function that requires its BTB domain for interactions with other co-repressors. the fact that the BTB domain of ZBTB2 is in common with those of KLHL7 and KLHL12 suggests that there might be a common epitope residing in the BTB domain. the HK1 has been identified as an autoantigen associated with autistic children. anti-HK1 autoantibodies were shown to impair growth and induce apoptosis in cultured human neuroblastoma cells. eukaryotic translation initiation factor EIF2C1 was also identified as a new autoantigen that was recognized by 15.2% PBC sera. six new autoantigens with at least 15% positivity in PBC serum samples. successful application of these autoantigens in a clinic friendly ELISA suggests that these new autoantigens may serve as useful serological biomarkers for diagnosis of PBC."}
