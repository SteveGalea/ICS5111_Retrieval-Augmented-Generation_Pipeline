{"summary": "Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF) is clinically characterized by hemorrhagic manifestations and central nervous system involvement. the incubation period of AHF is usually from 6 to 14 days, followed by the onset of fever with a flu-like syndrome that is considered to be the first day of clinical AHF. arenavirus genome consists of two single-stranded, negative-sense RNA segments, the small (S) and large (L) segments. each genomic segment uses an ambisense coding strategy to encode two gene products that are expressed in opposite orientations. NP is the most abundantly present viral protein in both infected cells and virions. the Z protein of the new world pathogenic arenaviruses has been shown to interfere with induction of IFN-I mediated by the cytosolic pattern recognition receptor RIG-I. also, the PML protein has been shown to interact with a variety of cellular factors, including the promyelocytic leukemia protein. rulence model does not accurately reproduce the pathobiological features of human AHF. guinea pigs and nonhuman primates are highly resistant to challenge with JUNV. studies in more-relevant animal models, guinea pigs and nonhuman primates are needed. virulent strains of JUNV and animal experiments performed in the university of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) facilities in accordance with institutional health and safety guidelines. rescue of recombinant Romero (rRom) and recombinant candid #1 (rCan) viruses previously described. guinea pigs were anesthetized using an isoflurane precision variable-bypass vaporizer prior to virus inoculation by the intraperitoneal route with 103 PFU. animals were anesthetized and implanted subcutaneously with BMDS IPTT-300 transponders (chips) animals were monitored for signs of infection or transponder migration for 2 days prior to transfer to the BSL-4 facility. a standard hematologic analysis was performed using a Hemavet 1700 analyzer (Drew Scientific, Inc.) total RNA from infected tissues lysed in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) was isolated using a direct-zol RNA MiniPrep kit (Zymo Research) following the manufacturer's protocol. RNA quantification was performed in triplicate using a iScript one-Step reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) kit. viral stocks prepared by infecting vero cells (multiplicity of infection [MOI] = 0.01) and collecting virus-containing tissue culture supernatants (CS) at 4 days postinfection (p.i.), followed by elimination of cell debris by centrifugation. work with virulent strains of JUNV and animal experiments were performed in the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) facilities. 10-fold dilutions of TCS specimens were determined by a plaque assay. plaques were revealed by fixation of cell monolayers with formaldehyde. infected tissues were dissected and homogenized in MEM containing 1% P/E. animals were anesthetized and implanted subcutaneously with BMDS IPTT-300 transponders (chips) obtained from Bio Medic Data Systems, Inc. (Seaford, DE), using a trocar needle assembly. animals were monitored for signs of infection or transponder migration for 2 days prior to transfer to the facility. serum dilutions corresponding to an endpoint of 50% plaque reduction were determined. RNA quantification was performed in triplicate using a iScript one-Step reverse transcription-PCR kit with SYBR green (Bio-Rad) the highly pathogenic Rom strain and attenuated Can strain of JUNV exhibit significant differences in amino acid sequences of the viral proteins (8, 7, 2, and 49 amino acid [aa] changes in the GPC, NP, Z, and LP loci. the polymerase complexes of Rom and Can replicate and transcribe the S segment of Can with similar efficiencies (25). this observation led us to consider the feasibility of using reverse genetic approaches to rescue rJUNV. rRom/CanGPC and rRom/CanNP produced plaques on vero cells. both viral genes carried by the S segment contribute to the JUNV plaque phenotype. black and gray colors indicate the genetic material of Rom and Can strains. rRom/G2/F427I strain exhibited growth properties in vero and A549 cells similar to those of rRom and rCan. a single amino acid substitution in the transmembrane region of GP2 (F427I) of the XJ13 strain of JUNV was shown to further increase attenuation in suckling mice. we infected guinea pigs with rRomL/CanS, rCanL/RomS, or rRom/G2/F427I. they monitored their survival and disease manifestations compared to those of guinea pigs infected with parental viruses, rRom and rCan. none of the guinea pigs inoculated with rRom/G2/F427I developed m infection, caused thrombocytopenia and general immunosuppression indicated by the reduction of platelet, lymphocyte, and total white blood cell counts, as well as by the decrease in albumin production and release of liver enzymes. rRom/CanS- and rRom/G2/F427I-infected animals were very similar to those of rCan-infected animals. rCanL/RomS 465 109/137 70 4.79 1.23/1.81 0.56 3.33 0.29/0.62 0.24 4.1 0.3/2.3 0.1 30 3/52 15 rRom/CanNP 518 188/164 74 4.53 0.79/1.87 1.0 3.15 0.29/0.62 0.07 4.1 0.3/2.3 0.4 28 1/46 9 rCandid #1 447 110/464 190 5.60 1.5/6.14 1.64 rRomL/CanS induced neutralizing antibody titers at 30 and 45 days p.i. than rRomL/CanS infection. rRom/G2/F427I infection induced much higher neutralizing antibody titers than rRomL/CanS infection. rRom/CanNP or rRom/CanGPC were used to infect guinea pigs. all animals infected with rRom/CanNP developed disease symptoms. all guinea pigs infected with rRom/CanGPC survived. length GPC of candid #1 origin compared histopathological manifestations in the spleen and liver of guinea pigs infected with different rJUNV strains. rRomL/CanS, rCanL/RomS, rRom/CanNP rRom/CanGPC, rRom/G2/F427I, and parental viruses rRom and rCan. livers of guinea pigs infected with rRom/G2/F427I showed more foci of mononuclear cell inflammation with the presence of hepatocyte apoptosis. rRom/G2/F427I replicates more efficiently in the organs of infected guinea pigs than rRomL/CanS and rRom/CanGPC. guinea pigs infected with chimeric JUNV variants were inoculated with 103 PFU of rJUNVs. additional mutations in can GPC were required to restrict viral replication in the organs of infected animals to below pathogenic levels. RNA was extracted from brain tissues of rJUNV-infected guinea pigs euthanized at 12 days p.i. levels of RNA derived from the NP locus were normalized to GAPDH mRNA levels. rRomL/CanS produced small plaques similar to those of rRom and rCan. both viral genes carried by the S segment contribute to the plaque phenotype observed for the reassortant rJUNV. we rescued two strains that expressed the GPC gene (rRom/CanGPC) or NP gene (rRom/CanNP) of Can in the backbone of the Rom genome. we infected (MOI = 5) IFN-deficient (Vero) and IFN-competent (A549) cells and determined titers of infectious virus in tissue culture supernatants (TCS) over time to examine the one-step growth curve for each rJUNV strain and thecorresponding parental rRom and rCan strains. these results indicated that the observed differences in plaque phenotype did not reflect impaired growth properties in cultured cells. we infected Hartley guinea pigs with rRomL/CanS, rCanL/RomS, or rRom/G2/F427I. guinea pigs infected with rRom and rCan experienced a steady weight loss starting at 7 days p.i., followed by rapid deterioration of the health of the animals around 11 days p.i. two of three experimental animals experienced mild weight loss between days 4 and 8 p.i. one of them also developed a transient fever that fully resolved by day 10 p.i. rCanL/RomS, similar to rRom infection, caused thrombocytopenia and general immunosuppression.
