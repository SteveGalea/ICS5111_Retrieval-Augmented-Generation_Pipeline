{"summary": "global cross-continental disease transmission is more likely by airline travel than by other means of travel, such as by boat. air travel is the main form of transportation to remote areas such as small towns in Alaska, Siberia, and certain islands in the Pacific [1] using the entire sample of 3100 air transport connected cities leads to connectedness bias. some of the most-connected cities are not necessarily the largest. some of the largest cities (and thus very important for their role in epidemics) might not be the most connected. the full OAG data set contains 3883 airport codes. however, a number of codes refer to train stations or bus stops. some small airports (100 passengers/day) are located on small islands for which population size was not available. we have selected networks containing the 52, 155, and 500 largest connected city nodes. we have also used the entire network of 2904 nodes. these sample sizes are equivalent to sampling proportions of 0.018, 0.05, 0.17, and 1 (on a natural logarithmic scale these sample sizes correspond approximately to 4, 5, 6, and 8). 99% of all commercial airlines report their daily scheduled flight information to the OAG throughout the year. most of the cities represented in the data set correspond to a single airport. for some larger cities, OAG has aggregated data from multiple airports. the samples varied by city list (OAG list, Epstein list), sampling method (most populous cities, cities with the greatest airline seat traffic, cities from Rvachev and Longini [10], cities from Epstein et al. [4], and sample size. for the sampling methods, we will refer to sampling the most populous cities as population-based, sampling the cities with the greatest airline seat traffic as volume-based. population-based, n = 52 sample provides reasonably good coverage if regions are defined as continents. volume-based, n = 52 sample includes no african cities and only one south american city. volume-based samples typically need to be larger than population-based samples. a sample of 52 cities with the largest flight volume accounts for about 40% of the total traffic. the coverage increases to about 75% for n = 155 and to about 90% for n = 500. a simple correlation analysis shows that city sizes and flight volumes are not strongly correlated. compared to the orthogonal regression, there are many large cities that have a small flight volume as well as small cities with high flight volume. the average shortest paths between the cities would become longer and betweenness would increase because a larger number of geodesics would pass through a node. at the same time, the probability is low that cities connected to a selected city have also been selected into the sample. the largest degree of 500, and the average degree is around 17. the same argument applies to the clustering coefficient and the geodesic. the same argument applies to the clustering coefficient and the geodesic. a sample as large as 1500 cities (about one-half of the total network) is needed to ensure that 50% of the cities appear on all four lists. a nonlinear relationship between sample size and betweenness produces a bump in the curves involving betweenness. the GEM differs from other models mostly in the details of stochasticity and seasonality. the specific details about the model equations, table of parameters, and multi-lag travel matrix can be found in the supporting materials. the requests for the code and information about the latest version of the model can be found at https://www.epimodels.org/midas/globalmodel.do. each number in the table is an average over 50 runs. the standard deviations varied between 3 and 6 days. a cell containing \u201c\u2013\u201d indicates that the city was not selected. 94 92 95 93 94 Sydney 25 27 26 27 25 27 25 24 27 27 Washington, DC \u2013 65 76 \u2013 65 72 64 65 65 63 a double dash means that the city is not present in the sample. we chose cities that represent major world regions (Athens, Beijing, Bogot\u00e1, Cairo, Cape Town, Istanbul, Lagos, London, Moscow, New Delhi, Sao Paulo, Shanghai, and Sydney) a reliable sample should include at least the 100\u2013150 cities with the largest flight volume and cities that are well connected. the addition of cities with large population sizes or those in remote locations will improve regional coverage. the population-based, n = 52 sample provides reasonably good coverage if regions are defined as continents. the volume-based, n = 52 sample includes no African cities and only one south american city. this result is not surprising since air traffic volume tends to reflect economic development. the coverage increases to about 75% for n = 155 and to about 90% for n = 500. the lower slope in the regression line compared to the orthogonal regression indicates that there are many large cities that have a small flight volume. a larger number of geodesics would pass through a node. at the same time, the sample's average degree does not show a monotonic decrease. when smaller and less-connected cities are added, the average degree decreases. the 25 most-connected cities are not necessarily the most central in terms of betweenness. we have created lists of cities sorted by air travel volume, population size, city betweenness, and city degree. 80% of the 155 highest volume cities also appear among the 155 highest degree cities and vice versa. a sample as large as 1500 cities (about one-half of the total network) is needed to ensure that 50% of the cities appear on all four lists. the multiplier generally decreases with increasing sample size. but a nonlinear relationship between sample size and betweenness produces a bump in the three curves involving betweenness. EM differs from other models mostly in the details of stochasticity and seasonality. the specific details about the model equations, table of parameters, and multi-lag travel matrix can be found in the supporting materials. a double dash means that the city is not present in the sample. a double dash means that the city is not present in the sample. model based on the sample was 7 days or larger (6 days was the largest standard deviation), we used bold font in that cell. we chose cities that represent major world regions (Athens, Beijing, Bogot\u00e1, Cairo, Cape Town, Istanbul, Lagos, London, Moscow, New Delhi, Sao Paulo, Shanghai, and Sydney) a reliable sample should include at least 100\u2013150 cities with the largest flight volume and cities that are well connected. the addition of cities with large population sizes or those in remote locations will improve regional coverage. the addition of cities with large population sizes or those in remote locations will improve regional coverage. a relatively small number of cities (around 200 or 300) can capture enough network information to adequately describe the global spread of a disease such as influenza. the models that aim to answer more specific questions need to consider a more systematic approach. the sample size should be the balance of the scale at which the conclusions are made. the analysis is based on the airline network, and its generalizability to other networks such as social or ground transportation might be limited. the current study has a number of limitations. the quantitative results would be different for each specific study. the methodology of selecting a sample based on individual and network characteristics will guide future studies."}
