{"summary": "METHODS Virus and Cells MERS-CoV isolate HCoV-EMC/2012 was grown in vero81 cells with Opti-MEM (Gibco) plus 5% fetal bovine serum (HyClone) the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) per milliliter was determined on vero81 cells and calculated using the Reed\u2013Muench method. qRT-PCR analysis was run in duplicate, using 200 ng of RNA per reaction with MERS-CoV nucleoprotein (N3) primers [11] and the SuperScript III Platinum One-Step qRT-PCR kit. samples were resected from formalin-fixed tissue. anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG; Vector Laboratories) was incubated for 30 minutes with Vectastain ABC-AP reagent and 25 minutes with Vulcan Fast Red chromogen. equal volumes of virus and sera were combined and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. the neutralization titer is the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution that neutralized the infectivity of 100 TCID50 of virus. animals were euthanized at days 1 or 3 after infection, and lung tissues were collected. all animal studies were conducted in biosafety level 3 laboratories. all protocols were approved by the NIH Animal Care and Use Committee. sections were baked at 60\u00b0C for 1 hour then deparaffinized with xylene and rehydrated with alcohol-gradated washes. hmAb m336 is effective in reducing MERS-CoV RNA Titers. rabbits received a Hendra virus\u2013specific hmAb (m102.4) as an isotype control. one day later, rabbits were infected intranasally with 105 TCID50 of MERS-CoV EMC/2012. neutralizing MERS-specific antibody titers in rabbits that received 1 mg/kg of m336 ranged from 10 to 32 immediately before infection. the group that received 10 mg/kg of m336 had serum titers ranging from 113 to 320 before virus inoculation. the control group of rabbits did not develop detectable neutralizing antibody against EMC/2012. not detected in rabbits following intranasal administration of m336. Rabbits received human monoclonal antibody (hmAb) m336 or irrelevant control hmAb m102.4 intranasally 24 hours before intranasal infection. m336 at either dose had minimal inflammation and no evidence of virus antigen. prophylaxis with hmAb m336 is effective in reducing viral RNA titers. antibody was administered to rabbits intravenously or intranasally 1 day after infection. additional rabbits received a Hendra virus\u2013specific hmAb (m102.4) as an isotype control. one day later, the rabbits were infected intranasally with 105 TCID50 of MERS-CoV. neutralizing MERS-specific antibody titers in rabbits that received 1 mg/kg of m336 ranged from 10 to 32 immediately before infection. the group that received 10 mg/kg of m336 had serum titers ranging from 113 to 320 before virus inoculation and from 101 to 320 on day 3 after infection. rabbits received merS-CoV\u2013specific human monoclonal antibody (hmAb) m336 or irrelevant control hmAb m102.4 intranasally 24 hours before intranasal infection with 105 50% tissue culture infective doses of EMC/2012. titers were quantified by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction analysis. treatment with m336 does not lead to a significant reduction in Viral RNA Titers. the antibody was administered to rabbits intravenously or intranasally 1 day after infection and lung tissue was collected at day 3 after infection. m336 antibody treatment by intravenous or intranasal route was not effective in reducing viral RNA titers. prophylaxis with hmAb m336 resulted in significant reduction of viral RNA titers and virus-related pathology in the lungs of rabbits. intravenous administration of m336 resulted in neutralizing antibody titers in the serum for several days. but intranasal administration of antibody did not result in detectable titers. this implies that the topically administered antibody remained in the respiratory tract. the hmAb m336 has high specificity and neutralizing activity against MERS-CoV in vitro. within 1 day of infection, we observed a 40 to 9000-fold reduction in pulmonary viral RNA load. m336 antibody, when administered before exposure, is able to prevent MERS-CoV infection."}
