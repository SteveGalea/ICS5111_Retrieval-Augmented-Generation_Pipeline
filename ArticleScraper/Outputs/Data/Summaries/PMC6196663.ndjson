{"summary": "retrospective case\u2013control study of children hospitalized between January 2014 and April 2015 who had a respiratory viral specimen collected. 198 were positive for HRV, 167 positive for another respiratory virus, and 306 where no respiratory virus was detected. HRV-positive patients had a significantly shorter length of stay compared with patients with no respiratory virus isolated. retrospective case\u2013control study conducted from January 2014 to April 2015. included children up to 18 years of age who had a respiratory viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) specimen obtained during hospitalization. readmissions within a 2-month interval were excluded and readmissions 2 months intervals were treated as independent events. Statistical analysis Patients were sorted into three groups based on whether their respiratory viral PCR detected HRV with or without another respiratory virus. primary outcome measures were requirement for mechanical ventilation, LOS, 14-day readmission, and mortality. patients were sorted into three groups based on whether their respiratory viral PCR detected HRV with or without another respiratory virus, some other respiratory virus, or no respiratory virus. primary outcome measures were requirement for mechanical ventilation, LOS, 14-day readmission, and mortality. ncytial virus (38%) followed by adenovirus (11.3%), parainfluenza type 3 (6.5%), influenza A (4.0%), influenza B (2.8%), parainfluenza type 2 (1.7%), and parainfluenza type 1 (0.9%). the only comorbidity associated with HRV was a history of asthma. leukocytosis and thrombocytosis were most common in HRV-positive patients. leukopenia and thrombocytopenia were most common in patients with no virus detected. Mortality was also highest in patients who had no respiratory virus detected (7.8%) compared to HRV patients (2.2%; P = 0.001) HRV-positive patients did have a significantly shorter LOS compared to patients with no respiratory virus isolated. by comparison, patients with another respiratory virus isolated also had a significantly shorter LOS (difference 0.35; P = 0.008) compared to patients with no respiratory virus isolated. a prospective study of HRV in hospitalized children detected HRV in 15% of patients with respiratory illness but also in 13% of asymptomatic controls. this study also noted that patients were less likely to have a LOS longer than 3 days compared to those with other viruses. the lack of adverse outcomes among HRV-positive patients may have been due to the prolonged positivity of HRV in nasal secretions. both HRV-positive patients and patients positive for another respiratory virus still had a significantly shorter LOS compared to patients with no respiratory virus detected (1.42 and 1.37 respectively, respectively, compared to 1.67 in log scale) the findings may not be generalizable to other settings. these patients had similar clinical outcomes to patients who had another respiratory virus isolated. this study also supports earlier evidence that HRV positivity is strongly associated with asthma and asthma appears to be a risk factor regardless of the clinical diagnosis."}
