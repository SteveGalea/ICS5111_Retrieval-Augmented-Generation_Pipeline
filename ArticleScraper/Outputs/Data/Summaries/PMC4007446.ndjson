{"summary": "in 2003, the virus responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) produced a near pandemic with 8,273 cases and 775 deaths (6). in 2012, a novel -coronavirus (HCoV-EMC) (7\u20139) was discovered that has already led to many fatalities (10\u201312) viruses lacking the E gene showed attenuation and did not grow in the central nervous system (23, 24), whereas stress response genes were up-regulated and cell apoptosis increased (25). these results suggest a role of E protein in both tissue tropism and pathogenicity, where modulation of stress responses contributes to viral attenuation. fusion peptides were found to be responsible for redirecting a plasma membrane protein to the Golgi region. however, mutations designed to increase its -helical propensity disrupted localization to membranes. in both proteins, the native cysteines were mutated to alanine. truncated form of the SARS-CoV E monomer includes both its TM domain and its predicted -coil motif at the C-terminal tail. the plasmid was transformed into pTBMalE plasmid downstream of the MBP fusion tag and tobacco etch virus cleavage sequence. the plasmid was transformed into pTBMalE plasmid downstream of the MBP fusion tag and a tobacco etch virus clea two EFL mutants previously described by Cohen et al. (43) were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis. protein expression was induced by adding 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio--d-galactopyranoside. cells were harvested by centrifugation at 7,500 g and stored at 80 \u00b0C. peptide was eluted in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 2 mm -mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 5 mm myristyl sulfobetaine. peptide was dissolved with 1% TFA in acetonitrile and separated under an isopropyl alcohol-acetonitrile linear gradient (4:1 (v/v) SDS-NuPAGE was performed in 4\u201312% NuPAGE\u00ae BisTris gel (Invitrogen) with NuPAGE\u00ae MES SDS running buffer and stained with SimplyBlueTM SafeStain (Invitrogen) the gel was run at 80 V for 2\u20133 h with MES running buffer containing 0.5% PFO. lyophilized ETR peptides were dissolved at 0.3, 0.5, and 0.8 (12-mm path length cell) in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 5.5, 50 mm NaCl, and for detergent either 5 mm C14SB, 100 mm DPC, or 12.5, 25, or 50 mm SDS. radial distribution profile was acquired after sufficient time to reach equilibrium, as tested by HeteroAnalysis. the tube was placed in a vacuum lyophilizer overnight to remove any residual methanol. the thin protein film was solubilized with sample buffer containing 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 5.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 50 mm SDS. a single point mutation (S60C) was introduced into ETR by site-directed mutagenesis using appropriate sets of primers. a 7% polyacrylamide gel was polymerized in a gel chamber of 5.4-mm inner diameter. after complete polymerization, gels were washed in H2O overnight and then twice with sample buffer containing 20 mm sodium phosphate and 50 mm NaCl at pH 5.5. the gels were then completely dried at room temperature. 1H-15N TROSY-HSQC spectra were recorded in presence and absence of 1 mm dry 5-doxyl stearic acid (5-DSA) or 16-doxyl stearic acid (16-DSA) the PRE effect was measured using 15N HSQC spectra of the S60C mutant. the intensities of cross-peaks in the MTSSL and dMTSSL (Id) were calculated in CARA. the correlation time was set to 10 ns. the ratios of intensities (Ip/Id) were normalized against a set of the eight highest Ip/Id ratios. 1DNH 0.71 0.03 Root mean square deviation from the average atomic coordinates (residues 12\u201363,)b Residues in most favored regions 87.5 Residues in additional allowed regions 12.5 Residues in generously allowed regions 12.5 Residues in additional allowed regions 0.0 Residues in additional allowed regions 0.0 Residues in additional allowed regions 0.0 Residues in additional allowed regions 0.0 Residu a negative control was synthesized by standard solid phase and purified by reverse-phase HPLC. a negative control consisting of C-terminal peptide from the small hydrophobic (SH) protein of human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV SH(45\u201365) was synthesized by standard solid phase. full-length SARS-CoV E protein (EFL) was cloned into pTBMalE plasmid downstream of the MBP fusion tag and tobacco etch virus cleavage sequence. the plasmid was transformed into pNIC28-Bsa4 with an N-terminal His6 tag followed by a tobacco etch virus cleavage sequence. culture density reached an A600 of 0.7, the medium was exchanged to M9 minimal medium at 25% of the initial volume. the medium was appropriately supplemented with 15N-NH4Cl and [13C]glucose (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) to produce 15N-labeled and 15N/13C-labeled protein. cells were harvested as described above and stored at 80 \u00b0C. peptide was dissolved with 1% TFA in acetonitrile and separated under an isopropyl alcohol-acetonitrile linear gradient. the identity and purity of peptide fractions were confirmed by SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF MS. peptide was solubilized (0.1 mm) in sample buffer containing 25 mm SDS and either 25, 50, or 100 mm DPC. Aquaporin Z in 20 mm SDS (heated at 65 \u00b0C for 10 min) was included as an additional molecular weight marker. Circular Dichroism CD data were acquired on a 0.2-mm quartz cuvette (Hellma). CD spectra were acquired from 180 to 260 nm with a 1-nm spectral bandwidth. data points with excessive absorbance were excluded. labeled ETR-S60C was dissolved in 20 mm sodium phosphate, 50 mm NaCl, 200 mm SDS, and 0.8 mm DTT at pH 5.5. a 10-fold molar excess of both reagents was added from 75 mm stocks in methanol. NMR experiments were performed at 308 K using an Avance-II 700 NMR spectrometer. Sodium 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate was used as the internal reference for 1H nuclei. the chemical shifts of 13C and 15N nuclei were calculated from the 1H chemical shifts. the titration experiments were performed with 15N-labeled ETR. NOE distance restraints were obtained from 15N NOESY-HSQC (mixing time 80, 100, and 150 ms) and 13C NOESY-HSQC (mixing time 120 ms) spectra. structure calculations were performed using CYANA version 3.0 (65, 66) and visualized using PyMOL (Schroedinger LLC, New York) CNS 1.3 (67, 68) was used to refine the structure using the standard simulated annealing protocol. all of the restraints used in the calculations were summarized in Table 1. giant unilamellar vesicles of 1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine were prepared in 1 m sorbitol using Nanion Vesicle Prep Pro\u00ae. 0.5 l of a giant unilamellar vesicle solution in ethanol was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. a buffer-equilibrated carboxymethyl dextran surface was activated with a 10-min injection of a 1:1 mixture of 0.05 m N-hydroxysuccinimide and 0.2 m N-ethyl-N-[3-(diethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide. another 10-min injection of 1 m ethanolamine-HCl (pH 8.5) was used to deactivate the surface. all three native cysteines (Cys-40, Cys-43, and Cys-44) were mutated into alanines. in both constructs, all three native cysteines were mutated into alanines. in addition, two EFL mutants previously described by Cohen et al. (43) were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis. cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 2 mm -mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol) the cells were completely lysed by sonication and microfluidization. insoluble particles were removed by centrifugation at 40,000 g. the identity and purity of peptide fractions were confirmed by SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF MS. gel electrophoresis Standard SDS-PAGE was performed in 13.5% Tris-glycine gel with TGS running buffer and stained with Coomassie Blue G-250. to perform electrophoresis in the presence of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFO) detergent, we modified Invitrogen's SDS-NuPAGE protocol lyophilized peptides were dissolved at A280 of 0.3, 0.5, and 0.8 (12-mm path length cell) in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 5.5, 50 mm NaCl, and for detergent either 5 mm C14SB, 100 mm DPC, or 12.5, 25, or 50 mm SDS. a radial distribution profile was acquired after sufficient time to reach equilibrium. 1.2 mg of lyophilized ETR protein was solubilized in 100 l of methanol. thin protein film was then solubilized with sample buffer containing 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 5.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 50 mm SDS. the sample was vortexed and sonicated several times until a clear solution was obtained. a centrifugal filter unit was used to remove excess of both reagents. labeled samples were washed four times by concentrating to 100 l. 7% polyacrylamide gel was polymerized in a gel chamber of 5.4-mm inner diameter. CO, HN(CA)CO, HNCA, HN(CO)CA, and HNCACB experiments on a 15N/13C-labeled ETR protein. side-chain resonances were assigned using three-dimensional 15N-resolved NOESY-HSQC (80-, 100-, and 150-ms mixing time), (H)CCH-TOCSY, and 13C-resolved NOESY-HSQC (120-ms mixing time from 13C\u2032, 13C, 13C, 1H, and 1H chemical shift values using TALOS+ (61) the short range and medium range NOE connectivities were used to establish the sequence-specific 1H NMR assignment and to identify elements of the regular secondary structure. 1.564 Medium (2 |i j| 4) 321 Long range (|i j| 5) 11 Dihedral angle restraints 85 Hydrogen bond restraintsa 20 RDC restraints 44 PRE restraints 38 Root mean square deviation from the experimental residual dipolar couplings (Hz) 1DNH 0.71 0.03 Root mean square deviation from the average atomic coordinates. surface plasmon resonance measurements were performed on a biacore 3000 system (GE Healthcare) using 10 mm phosphate buffer at pH 6.5, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.05% n-octyl--d-glucopyranoside, and 0.27% C14-betaine at 25 \u00b0C. a 10-min injection of a 1:1 mixture of 0.05 m N-hydroxysuccinimide and 0.2 m full-length SARS-CoV E protein (EFL) was cloned into pTBMalE plasmid downstream of the MBP fusion tag and tobacco etch virus cleavage sequence. all three native cysteines (Cys-40, Cys-43, and Cys-44) were mutated into alanines. 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio--d-galactopyranoside was produced by growing the culture in LB medium at 37 \u00b0C. cells were harvested by centrifugation at 7,500 g and stored at 80 \u00b0C. cells were completely lysed by sonication and microfluidization. peptide was eluted in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 2 mm -mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 5 mm myristyl sulfobetaine (C14SB) peptide was dissolved with 1% TFA in acetonitrile and separated under an isopropyl alcohol-acetonitrile linear gradient (4:1 ( peptide was dissolved in sample buffer containing 4% PFO. gel was run at 80 V for 2\u20133 h with MES running buffer containing 0.5% PFO. Aquaporin Z in 20 mm SDS (heated at 65 \u00b0C for 10 min) was included as an additional molecular weight marker. D2O was added at 61.6, 65, and 72.4% to each SDS concentration. samples were centrifuged in six-channel Epon centerpieces using quartz windows. 0.3 mm 15N-labeled ETR-S60C was dissolved in 20 mm sodium phosphate, 50 mm NaCl, 200 mm SDS, and 0.8 mm DTT at pH 5.5. a 10-fold molar excess of both reagents was added from 75 mm stocks in methanol. gels were dried overnight and then twice with sample buffer containing 20 mm sodium phosphate and 50 mm NaCl at pH 5.5. the protein solution containing ETR/SDS was then compressed into a 4.2-mm inner diameter tube using the gel press assembly (New Era Enterprise, Inc.) tra were recorded in the presence and absence of 1 mm dry 5-doxyl stearic acid (5-DSA) or 16-doxyl stearic acid (16-DSA) the PRE effect was measured using 15N HSQC spectra of the S60C mutant before spin labeling and after MTSSL and dMTSSL labeling. peaks with ratios below 0.15, no lower distance restraints were used. upper and lower distance restraints were generated using 3 margins. structure calculations were performed using CYANA version 3.0 (65, 66) idues in disallowed regions 0.0 a Backbone hydrogen bonds of -helix were applied to regions confirmed to be -helical. single channel activity measured by using Nanion Port-a-Patch\u00ae. giant unilamellar vesicles of 1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine containing 10% cholesterol were prepared in 1 m sorbitol. plasmon resonance measurements were performed on a biacore 3000 system (GE Healthcare) using 10 mm phosphate buffer at pH 6.5, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.05% n-octyl--d-glucopyranoside, and 0.27% C14-betaine at 25 \u00b0C. a buffer-equilibrated surface was activated with a 10-min injection of a 1:1 mixture of 0.05 m N a series of hexahistidine-tagged SARS-CoV E constructs were screened to obtain an expressing and well behaved sample. the best construct, encompassing residues 8\u201365, was successfully expressed in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography in milligram amounts without any enzymatic cleavage steps. after HPLC, the ETR monomer (9 kDa) showed anomalous migration in standard SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1F 1H-15N TROSY-HSQC spectra of 0.2 mm ETR in 50 mm SDS in H2O (A) and in 99% D2O (B) the cross-peaks are labeled by one-letter code and residue number. peak intensity reduction upon the addition of 5-DSA (C) and 16-DSA (D), calculated as the ratio of peak intensity before and after the addition of the paramagnetic reagents. a longer -helix (residues 15\u201345) encompasses the TM domain, which is connected to another shorter -helix (residues 55\u201365) by a flexible (see Fig. 2E) linker domain (residues 46\u201354), forming an L-shape. the most affected residues, which would face the micelle surface, are Val-52, Thr-55, Tyr-59, and Ly the TM -helix has a slight bend at residues 26\u201330, consistent with previous results for the synthetic TM domain in DPC micelles (34). a kink near this location is suggested by the short distance (2.0 0.1 ) between Thr-30 H and the carbonyl oxygen at Phe-26, in the range of a hydrogen bond. d amide I band of ETR (red) and EFL (blue) in DMPC lipid bilayers and their respective Fourier self-deconvolved spectra. comparison of secondary 13C chemical shifts for ETR (red dots) and EFL (blue dots) in SDS micelles and for ETR in mixed SDS/DPC micelles. for the latter, Pro-54 and Thr-55 were excluded from the analysis. Ion Channel Activity of ETR and its Inhibition by HMA Purified EFL has channel activity (71), which is inhibited by the drug HMA (30). an I/V plot obtained in a symmetrical 0.5 m NaCl experiment for purified ETR in 1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine was used to determine a conductance of 0.39 0.02 nanosiemens. arrows show residues with significant change in chemical shifts after the addition of HMA. arrows show residues with significant change in chemical shifts after the addition of the drug. significant CSP (CSP 0.025 ppm) clustered near the membrane interface regions of the TM domain. most affected were Glu-8, Gly-10, Thr-11, Val-14, asn-15, and Ser-16. at the C-terminal end of the TM, Leu-37 was the most affected. a constant SDS concentration (25 mm) was titrated with increasing DPC. bands consistent with dimers and trimers were observed at 1:1 and 1:2 molar ratios. tetramers and pentamers were observed at a 1:4 molar ratio. radial distribution profiles (open circles) of ETR in a (25:100 mm) SDS/DPC mixture at 16,600 rpm (red), 20,300 rpm (green), and 24,900 rpm (blue) the profile was fitted to a monomer-pentamer self-association model (black line) the fitting residuals are shown below each plot. the site of interaction with E is not known, but it is likely to involve the C-terminal tail because it is the largest extramembrane domain. to test that the conformation of ETR is structurally equivalent to the sequence in EFL, we tested its ability to interact with Nsp3a (49) using surface plasmon resonance. rapid and reversible interaction was observed using purified Nsp3a. affinity was determined as 1.6 mm, although binding is already evident at concentrations as small as 1\u201310 m. the residues involved in the interaction were identified by the differences in CSP values before and after the addition of Nsp3a to ETR. to test if at least some part of the population adopts this structure in lipid membranes, we mutated EFL residues 56\u201359 to increase the predicted helicity of this part of the molecule (43), from -branched Val or bulky Tyr to small side chain Ala. to test the effect of the conserved Pro-54 at the center of this putative motif, we generated the mutant EP54A. infrared amide I and II bands corresponding to SARS-CoV E peptide E46\u201360 in DMPC lipid bilayers before (blue) and after (red) being exposed to D2O (39). synthetic peptide E46\u201360 (39), which encompasses the predicted -hairpin in SARS-CoV E, was found to produce 100% -structure and was completely resistant to H/D exchange (Fig. 9C). coV E proteins have been proposed to have at least two roles. one is related to their TM channel domain. this would be active in the secretory pathway, altering lumenal environments and rearranging secretory organelles. the other would be related to their extramembrane domains. the purified peptide appeared in MALDI-TOF MS as a single-charged peak at 8,997 Da and a double-charged peak at 4,512 Da. after HPLC, the ETR monomer (9 kDa) showed anomalous migration in standard SDS-PAGE. the topology of ETR was also delineated by introducing the paramagnetic probes 5-DSA and 16-DSA. a slight intensity reduction was observed around residues 11\u201320 and 40\u201355. the addition of 16-DSA caused pronounced intensity reduction in the stretch of TM residues 19\u201340. shorter C-terminal -helix (residues 55\u201365) by a flexible linker domain (residues 46\u201354), forming an L-shape. most affected residues, which would face the micelle surface, are Val-52, Thr-55, Tyr-59, and Lys-63. IR spectra of ETR in DPC, SDS, and mixed (1:2 molar ratio) SDS/DPC micelles are almost superimposable. these data are entirely consistent with the CD spectra of EFL. both ETR and EFL (i) are predominantly -helical and (ii) have a secondary structure. 13C chemical shifts of ETR and EFL in SDS are highly correlated with secondary structure (72, 73) in EFL, the shifts for the last 10 residues (residues 66\u201376) are predicted to correspond to random coil, which is consistent with results obtained previously with a synthetic peptide spanning residues 59\u201376 (39). synthetic full-length SARS-CoV E and ETM (residues 7\u201338) produced single channel conductances of 0.19 0.06 picosiemens and 0.18 0.12 nanosiemens in 1 m NaCl. the lower conductance observed in synthetic samples may be due to extraneous modifications or impurities resulting from exposure to harsh chemicals. the arrows show residues with significant change in chemical shifts after the addition of HMA. the TM domain is indicated only to guide the eye. the arrows show residues with significant change in chemical shifts. gel electrophoresis performed in the presence of SDS or an SDS/DPC mixture. no oligomerization is consistent with the lack of interaction between HMA and ETR observed in SDS micelles. equilibrium sedimentation data could be fitted to several oligomeric models. similar ambiguous results were obtained for a 1:2 molar ratio SDS/DPC mixture (Fig. 7C), suggesting that ETR forms a mixture of oligomers in SDS/DPC micelles. the mobility of ETR in PFO-NuPAGE corresponds to a molecular mass of 45 kDa (i.e. a pentameric form) the interaction of ETR with Nsp3a was previously mapped to an N-terminal acidic domain, Nsp3a (49) Binding and unbinding of RSV SH(45\u201365) was very slow (>1 min) the data could not be fitted to any model, suggesting a nonspecific interaction. the association phase extends from 0 to 60 s, whereas the dissociation phase extends for minutes. 3a and ETR were identified by the differences in CSP values before and after the addition of Nsp3a to ETR in SDS/DPC micelles (1:4 molar ratio) large chemical shift changes at leu-39, Val-49, and Leu-65 indicated a potential binding site at the C-terminal tail, whereas the central TM region did not experience any change. the IR spectrum of these mutants shows a similar amide I band. however, for the mutant EP54A, two shoulders are eliminated. this indicates that these shoulders in EFL do not represent misfolded protein. the predicted -hairpin in SARS-CoV E, was found to produce 100% -structure and completely resistant to H/D exchange (Fig. 9C). a delicate balance between these two forms may alter processes in the infected cell (e.g. membrane scission, binding to protein partners, or E protein localization). expression and purification of SARS-CoV E protein Initially, we successfully expressed and purified full-length SARS-CoV E protein (EFL, Fig. 1B) by using either a -barrel (71) or MBP as fusion tags. however, the yield of pure protein was low due to the presence of truncations. the best construct, encompassing residues 8\u201365, was successfully expressed in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography in mill 1H-15N TROSY-HSQC spectra of 0.2 mm ETR in 50 mm SDS in H2O (A) and in 99% D2O (B) identified a stretch of 21 residues, from leu-18 to leu-39, protected from H/D exchange in EFL. the same residues were protected from H/D exchange in EFL. a 1H-15N steady-state heteronuclear NOE experiment (Fig. 2E) showed that the protein forms a well folded structure, with high 1H/15N NOE values. however, more dynamic regions can be observed (i) at the N terminus and (ii) at residues 46\u201355, which connect the TM domain to the proposed membrane-bound domain. the latter is predicted to be -helical (Fig. 2F). the TM -helix has a slight bend at residues 26\u201330. the TM -helix has a slight bend at residues 26\u201330. a kink near this location is suggested by the short distance between Thr-30 H and the carbonyl oxygen at Phe-26. both ETR and EFL (i) are predominantly -helical and (ii) have a secondary structure that is not significantly affected by the reconstitution environment. comparison of 13C chemical shifts of ETR and EFL in SDS shows that ETR shifts (red) are almost identical to their counterpart residues (residues 8\u201365) in EFL (blue) IR spectrum centered around 1,650 cm1 and immediately experienced complete H/D exchange. only the N-terminal region (residues 7\u201315) showed minor differences. a comparison between EFL and ETR in an SDS/DPC mixture also revealed an almost identical pattern in the C-terminal tail. cis and trans compartments contained 10 mm HEPES and 500 mm NaCl at pH 5.5. each point represents the mean of at least three current readings. the line is a linear regression fit of data points. in mixed SDS, the average CSP value was low, 0.006 ppm (Fig. 5F), even at an HMA/ETR 10:1 molar ratio. the same panel shows that the addition of HMA to ETR in mixed SDS/DPC micelles produced an average CSP value of 0.013 ppm, even at an HMA/ETR 2:1 molar ratio. no oligomerization is consistent with the lack of interaction between HMA and ETR observed in SDS/DPC micelles. the equilibrium sedimentation data could be fitted to several oligomeric models, from trimers to heptamers. the traces to a monomer-pentamer model produced an apparent Ka of 1.25 1015 m4 (i.e. 6 103 m1) or a Kd for monomer-monomer interaction of 0.17 mm and a molar fraction standard free energy change (74), Gx0, of approximately 4 kcalmol1. higher oligomeric states, including pentamers, are observed when increasing the DPC concentration. the mobility of ETR in PFO-NuPAGE corresponds to a molecular mass of 45 kDa (i.e. a pentameric form) thus, E-TM, ETR, and EFL show a similar oligomerization behavior, being able to form pentameric channels that are inhibited by HMA. inset, dose-response plot, where the equilibrium responses of Nsp3a were plotted against the log10(concentration) of Nsp3a. binding is already evident even in interval 1\u201310 m Nsp3a concentration. we investigated the structure of the C-terminal extramembrane domain of ETR and its apparent contrast with secondary structure predictions. the secondary structure predictions clearly suggest the presence of a -turn- motif in the C-terminal region, not only in SARS-CoV E but also in other representative sequences of other coronaviruses. a similar effect was observed for the P54A mutant in IR spectrum. regions that change after mutation of the four residues indicated in Fig. 1A (E4ALA) are shown. a reconstructed model was obtained based on the published structure of the E-TM pentamer (34) and the current ETR structure. the model suggests that these residues belong to different monomers. the side chains of Val-49 and Leu-65, which have been shown to interact with HMA, are shown as line representations. a series of hexahistidine-tagged SARS-CoV E constructs were screened to obtain an expressing and well behaved sample. the best construct, encompassing residues 8\u201365, was successfully expressed in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography in milligram amounts without any enzymatic cleavage steps. after HPLC, the ETR monomer (9 kDa) showed anomalous migration in standard SDS-PAGE. 1H-15N TROSY-HSQC spectra of 0.2 mm ETR in 50 mm SDS in H2O (A) and in 99% D2O (B) cross-peaks are labeled by one-letter code and residue number. peak intensity reduction upon the addition of 5-DSA (C) and 16-DSA (D), calculated as the ratio of peak intensity before and after the addition of the paramagnetic reagents. a longer -helix (residues 15\u201345) encompasses the TM domain, which is connected to another shorter -helix (residues 55\u201365) by a flexible (see Fig. 2E) linker domain (residues 46\u201354), forming an L-shape. the most affected residues, which would face the micelle surface, are Val-52, Thr-55, Tyr-59, and Ly a kink near this location is suggested by the short distance (2.0 0.1 ) between Thr-30 H and the carbonyl oxygen at Phe-26, in the range of a hydrogen bond. effect of truncation and the presence of a His tag on the ETR secondary structure was also determined. comparison of secondary 13C chemical shifts for ETR (red dots) and EFL (blue dots) in SDS micelles. for the latter, Pro-54 and Thr-55 were excluded from the analysis. Arg-38 was excluded from the analysis due to the peak overlapping. Ion Channel Activity of ETR and its Inhibition by HMA Purified EFL has channel activity (71), which is inhibited by the drug HMA (30). synthetic full-length SARS-CoV E and ETM (residues 7\u201338) produced single channel conductances of 0.19 0.06 picosiemens and 0.18 0.12 nanosiemens in 1 m NaCl (35) arrows show residues with significant change in chemical shifts after the addition of HMA. arrows show residues with significant change in chemical shifts after the addition of the drug. the most affected were Glu-8, Gly-10, Thr-11, Val-14, asn-15, and Ser-16. at the C-terminal end of the TM, leu-37 was the most affected, suggesting that the interaction of HMA at H of Arg-38 reported previously (34) may have been an artifact due to a TM peptide. oligomeric states, including pentamers, are indicated by arrows and black dots, respectively. arrows and black dots indicate higher oligomeric states, including pentamers, when increasing the DPC concentration. radial distribution profiles (open circles) of ETR in a (25:100 mm) SDS/DPC mixture at 16,600 rpm (red), 20,300 rpm (green), and 24,900 rpm (blue) the profile was fitted to a monomer-pentamer self-association model (black line) the site of interaction with E is not known, but it is likely to involve the C-terminal tail because it is the largest extramembrane domain. as a negative control, the mock peptide RSV SH(45\u201365) was used to bind to immobilized ETR in detergent. rapid and reversible interaction was observed using purified Nsp3a. affinity was determined as 1.6 mm, although binding is already evident at concentrations as small as 1\u201310 m. residues involved in the interaction were identified by the differences in CSP values before and after the addition of Nsp3a to ETR in SDS/DPC micelles. we mutated EFL residues 56\u201359 to increase the predicted helicity of this part of the molecule (43) to obtain the construct E4ALA. to test the effect of the conserved Pro-54 at the center of this putative motif, we generated the mutant EP54A. however, for the mutant E4ALA, two shoulders are eliminated. synthetic peptide E46\u201360 (39) was found to produce 100% -structure. a delicate balance between these two forms may alter processes in the infected cell (e.g. membrane scission, binding to protein partners, or E protein localization) a reconstructed model was obtained based on the published structure of the E-TM pentamer (34) and the current ETR structure. coV E proteins have been proposed to have at least two roles. one is related to their TM channel domain. this would be active in the secretory pathway, altering lumenal environments. the other would be related to their extramembrane domains."}
