{"summary": "small simple viruses may contain fewer than a dozen genes on a genome consisting of a few kilo-bases that encode up to a dozen proteins. significantly more complex eukaryotic organisms possess genomes in the mega-base range that, with alternative splicing and various possible post-translational modifications, may encode upwards of millions of protein permutations. kinase signaling is a powerful and central cellular mechanism that mediates signal transduction events. it is involved in a wide range of nearly all cellular processes including cell cycle progression, transcriptional regulation, cell transformation, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. assessing the kinome can provide insight into complex pathological processes across a wide array of diseases. siRNA siRNAs are regulators of expression and function of genes. double stranded precursors are cleaved by dicer proteins into short fragments. resulting decrease in mRNA in the cell leads to a decrease in expression of the gene. kinase or phosphorylase siRNA screens in cell lines can also be performed. kinases have a role in acquired resistance to CDK4/6 small-molecule inhibitors which are associated with breast cancer. kinase is a key modifier of sensitivity to the inhibitor. gene expression measurements can be determined by coupling qPCR with reverse transcription (RT-qPCR), where RNA is reverse transcribed into cDNA, then the cDNA is used as the template for qPCR. the expression of gene copy number for numerous kinases and phosphatases in a sample can be determined using qPCR assays. two most common detection methods are by the incorporation of fluorescently-labeled nucleotides during synthesis, or the incorporation of biotin-labeled nucleotides. mRNA molecules are taken from a sample and a reference, the samples are converted into complementary DNA, then are labeled with separate fluorescent probes. expression of the kinome can be observed with this method by using probe sequences of kinases and phosphatases. peptide arrays can be designed for a variety of different classes of kinase activity such as tyrosine kinases, serine kinases or threonine kinases. peptide arrays can be adapted for any particular species for which the genome sequence is known [[29], [30], [31]]. phospho-ELISAs can be found both for specific kinases, such as ERK1/2 or EGFR, as well as for broader kinase classes such as phospho-tyrosine [37] or phospho-serine/threonine activity. a common use is to determine or confirm whether specific kinase signaling pathways are activated under different conditions. flow cytometry is a useful tool for analyzing a multitude of cell signaling pathways in one experiment. cells can also be rapidly screened for phosphorylation by using automated microscopy in 96-well plates. other assays have been designed to monitor wound healing in the presence of different chemical compounds. high-throughput, tandem mass spectrometry based techniques have become the main method for identification of protein phosphorylation sites. these techniques allow one to collect phosphorylated peptides from any protein sample of interest and identify thousands of phosphorylation sites within a reasonable timeframe. phosphorylated peptides are eluted at high pH where they can be purified. this method can be performed either in batch format by adding beads directly to the peptide solution, by using a TiO2 column in an HPLC format [53], or in a microcolumn format where metal oxide beads are packed into a pipette tip containing C8 material. the same research group used six different methods to analyze the phosphoproteome of Arabidopsis. they used a combination of TiO2, ZrO2 and iron-immobilized metal affinity chromatography (Fe-IMAC) coupled to ammonia or phosphate buffers for phosphopeptide elution. methylesterification is that heavy labels can be used in the labelling reagent to perform phosphosite quantification. the disadvantage to using methylesterification is increased variation during the sample labelling steps. it is also possible to prevent non-specific binding by changing buffer conditions. phosphopeptides from HeLa cell digests were first enriched by HILIC chromatography followed by enrichment by Fe-IMAC. from 300 g of HeLa cell protein they were able to identify 1000 unique phosphorylation sites, including 700 novel sites not previously discovered. kinases and other ATPases are enriched through binding to avidin or streptavidin agarose and then eluted for LC-MS/MS analysis. the latter method will identify multiple peptides per kinase and provides stronger evidence for identification. the latter can be used to quantify the extent of active site labelling. Patricelli et al. used the ActivX system to profile kinases and identify potential kinase inhibitors in HL60 and PC3 cancer cell lines. to quantify these proteins, they specifically targeted the active site peptides of approximately 100 of these kinases. they measured the effect of several different inhibitors on the signal intensity of these peptides to find IC50 values and binding affinities. high throughput kinase activity kits can be purchased through several companies. kits measure specific kinase activities (ex. Abcam) and universal kinase activity (ex. R&D) RNAi panel screening is a high throughput method using siRNAs to determine the effects of multiple genes in a specific experimental system. some panels are specific for specific cellular functional pathways, such as Qiagen's SureSilencing\u00ae siRNA arrays. sen and colleagues used a kinome-wide siRNA screen to identify kinases that have a role in acquired resistance to CDK4/6 small-molecule inhibitors which are associated with breast cancer [19]. this study was able to determine which kinase was a key modifier of sensitivity to the inhibitor, and was also able to restore sensitivity by targeting this factor. cDNA is used as the template for qPCR. it can be used to target specific phosphatases or kinases of interest. the expression of gene copy number can be determined using qPCR assays. expression of the kinome can be observed by using probe sequences of kinases and phosphatases. using a cDNA microarray, Lee and colleagues identified a cysteine-rich receptor-like kinase that is responsive to a fungal pathogen. kinases involved in tau protein hyperphosphorylation, known to occur during Alzheimer's disease. siRNA transfection was used for 572 kinases, then increases or decreases in tau phosphorylation levels in a neuroglioma cell line were observed. using kinase or phosphorylase siRNA screens in cell lines to determine cell viability can also be performed. polymerase chain reaction polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a highly sensitive technique that rapidly amplifies specific segments of DNA in a sample. amplification of DNA fragments into billions of copies allows detection and identification of gene sequences in a sample using specific primers that are short DNA fragments. cDNA microarrays are assays that examine expression levels of a large number of genes simultaneously. microarrays can be used to identify kinase activity by spotting proteins onto microarray slides, then adding kinases with phosphatases. peptide arrays have become a productive, high-throughput method for studying cellular or tissue kinomes [27]. this technique involves spotting glass arrays or 96 well plates with peptide sequences that are kinase-targets. the array is then exposed to a lysate containing active kinases. this results in peptide phosphorylation and generates a visual signal. phospho-ELISAs can be found both for specific kinases, such as ERK1/2 or EGFR, as well as for broader kinase classes such as phospho-tyrosine [37] or phospho-serine/threonine activity. a common use of this technique is to determine whether specific kinase signaling pathways are activated under different conditions. peptide array is exposed to a lysate containing active kinases. this results in peptide phosphorylation and generates a visual signal of substrate-enzyme phosphorylation such as HRP or autoradiography. peptide arrays can be adapted for any species for which the genome sequence is known [[29], [30], [31]]. phospho-ELISAs can be found both for specific kinases, such as ERK1/2 or EGFR, as well as for broader kinase classes such as phospho-tyrosine [37] or phospho-serine/threonine activity. a common use is to determine or confirm whether specific kinase signaling pathways are activated under different conditions. flow cytometry can be easily used to evaluate phosphorylation events where fresh or fixed cells are incubated with phospho-specific antibodies and then conjugated to a fluorescent tag for detection. one can calculate the number of cells that are incubated with phospho-specific antibodies and then conjugated to a fluorescent tag for detection. newer flow cytometers can analyze samples in a 96-well plate format. a second advantage of flow cytometry is the ability to multiplex multiple antibodies. multiple samples may also be barcoded and combined into a single tube for high-throughput analysis. high content screening and fluorescent microscopy used in kinase-focused library to identify novel kinase inhibitors of p38-mediated MK2-EGFP translocation. phosphorylation targets can trigger a signaling cascade, which leads to activation of transcription factors and changes in protein expression. phosphorylation can also affect downstream signaling. metal oxide affinity chromatography (MOAC) uses beads composed of metal oxides such as TiO2 or ZrO2 to bind phosphorylated peptides and separate them from their non-modified counterparts. under acidic conditions, phosphorylated peptides will adsorb to the surface of metal oxide beads. this method can be performed either in batch format by adding beads directly to the peptide solution. the type of metal used may affect the binding affinity of specific phosphorylated sequences. lactic acid and B-hydroxypropanoic acid provided the best results. of the 1645 phosphopeptides they identified, 636 were identified by both methods. non-specific binding of acidic peptides is a significant issue with IMAC. one method to prevent non-specific binding with IMAC is to chemically modify acidic residues via methyl esterification. a direct comparison of the two methods resulted in 47 phosphopeptides identified by SAX and 24 identified by IMAC at 0.96% FDR. hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) uses hydrophilic column material coupled with hydrophobic mobile phases to separate hydrophilic from hydrophobic compounds. phosphorylated peptides are eluted at high pH where they can be purified and subsequently sequenced by mass spectrometry. the technique can be performed either in batch format by adding beads directly to the peptide solution, by using a TiO2 column in an HPLC format [53], or in a microcolumn format where metal oxide beads are packed into a pipette tip containing C8 material. the same research group used six different methods to analyze the phosphoproteome of Arabidopsis. they used a combination of TiO2, ZrO2 and iron-immobilized metal affinity chromatography (Fe-IMAC) coupled to ammonia or phosphate buffers for phosphopeptide elution. the disadvantage to using methylesterification is increased variation during the sample labelling steps. a solution of 6% acetic acid adjusted to pH 3.5 with NaOH provided optimal binding conditions for phosphopeptide binding. phosphopeptides from HeLa cell digests were first enriched by HILIC chromatography followed by enrichment by Fe-IMAC. from 300 g of HeLa cell protein they were able to identify 1000 unique phosphorylation sites, including 700 novel sites not previously discovered. kinases and other ATPases are enriched through binding to avidin or streptavidin agarose and then eluted for LC-MS/MS analysis. kinases exist in a state of constant interaction with other proteins in the cellular network that may modify their activity. this is at least part of the reason for poor translation of many kinase inhibitors from in vitro. Patricelli et al. used the ActivX system to profile kinases and identify potential kinase inhibitors in HL60 and PC3 cancer cell lines. they specifically targeted the active site peptides of approximately 100 of these kinases. they measured the effect of several different inhibitors on the signal intensity of these peptides to find IC50 values and binding affinities. high throughput kinase activity kits can be purchased through several companies. kits measure specific kinase activities (ex. Abcam) and universal kinase activity (ex. R&D) the acyl group reacts with a conserved lysine residue in most ATP-binding sites leaving behind the desthiobiotin tag. the acyl group reacts with a conserved lysine residue in most ATP-binding sites leaving behind the desthiobiotin tag. kinases can be isolated in their intact state after reaction with the ATPase probe and subsequently trypsin-digested on-bead. kinases exist in a state of constant interaction with other proteins in the cellular network that may modify their activity. this is at least part of the reason for poor translation of many kinase inhibitors from in vitro assays into being used as treatment for disease. the first step in this chemical reaction is the reversible conversion of D-luciferin to luciferyl adenylate using ATP. the assays quantify the amount of kinase activity that remains in a sample after a kinase reaction. kinase-dependent ATP depletion is measured. a common strategy is to use expression methodologies such as siRNA or RT-qPCR to first identify the kinases and phosphatases that are present. then perform further investigations using kinase activity assays to determine the activities of those identified enzymes. each method has advantages and disadvantages (Table 1) which need to be considered when designing an experiment. microscopy Once set up it can be automated.
