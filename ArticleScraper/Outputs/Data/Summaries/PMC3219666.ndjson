{"summary": "fecal samples were obtained from 212 cats (107 pet and 105 feral) in 2009. fourteen cats were FCoV-positive, including infections with type I FCoV (n = 8), type II FCoV (n = 4), and types I and II co-infection (n = 2). the majority of field isolates in these countries are of type I. however, in a small proportion of cats, FCoV infection leads to the development of a lethal, immune-mediated condition known as feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) 129 samples were from clinically healthy cats and 83 were from cats displaying symptoms of illness that included inappetence, anorexia, weight loss, weight loss, lethargy, icterus, fever, diarrhea, and thoracic effusion. RNA extraction and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) Viral RNA was extracted from fecal samples. the phylogenetic tree was created by a neighbor-joining method using MEGA 4.0 software. the phylogenetic tree was created by a neighbor-joining method using a neighbor-joining method. ted PCR using primers for the amplification of the highly conserved 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of the FCoV genome [19] is a multiplex-nested PCR using 2 L of the first PCR product as the template and nested primers [5] for discrimination of type I and II FCoVs. the phylogenetic tree was created using a neighbor-joining method. the phylogenetic tree was created by a neighbor-joining method. 212 feline fecal swab samples, eight positive for FCoV type I, four positive for type II, and two positive for types I and II (n = 2). Among the ill cats, the infections were due to type I (n = 6), type II (n = 3) and both types I and II (n = 2). canine coronavirus (CCoV) or TGEV can be used as a target antigen because of their close serological identity with FCoV. the prevalence of anti-FCoV antibody in the feline samples was low. all six Korean type II FCoVs (08K-609, 08K-656, 08K-1154, 08K-1553, 08K-559/II and 08K-1429/II) were shown to be originated from the same lineage as F20-54-II isolated from Japan (Figure 2). phylogenetic relationships between partial spike gene sequences of 46 coronaviruses were obtained from GenBank. there was no incidence of co-infection with type I and II FCoV in healthy cats. the prevalence of co-infection in ill Korean cats was slightly higher. this indicates that type II FCoV may have originated from a double recombination between type I FCoV and type II CCoV. the perfect bootstrap percentage on the node indicates that our strains may have originated from this type II prototype. the authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
