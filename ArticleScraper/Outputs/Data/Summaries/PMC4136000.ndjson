{"summary": "since September 2012, 206 cases, including 86 deaths, have been attributed to infection with MERS-CoV. the virus rapidly spread to 29 different countries, resulting in 8,273 confirmed cases and 775 (9%) deaths. significant progress has been made toward understanding the epidemiology, ecology, and biology of the virus. over 30 whole- or partial-genome sequences from different patients have been posted to GenBank. a subset of MERS-CoV patients reported close contact with camels. the most promising and clinically available drugs were ribavirin and interferon (IFN), or a combination of the two, since they demonstrated efficacy in an in vivo model for MERS-CoV infection (15, 16). this combination has failed to demonstrate benefit in the small number of severely ill MERS-CoV patients treated (17). the ISARIC recommendations had few alternatives for treating clinicians. 66 of the screened drugs were effective at inhibiting either MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV infection in vitro. 27 of these compounds were effective against both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. this data demonstrate the efficiency of screening approved or clinically developed drugs. mouse adapted SARS-CoV (MA15) has been described previously (24). a subset of 290 compounds was selected for screening against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV based on the antiviral activity observed in screens against other RNA viruses (21). compounds were shot in nanoliter volumes directly onto 96-well plates. plates were frozen at 80\u00b0C for a minimum of 24 h prior to shipment. compounds were plated in 200 l of media at 4 times the final concentrations. duplicate plates were pretreated with drugs for 1 h before the plates were transferred into the containment laboratory to add MERS-CoV strain Hu/Jordan-N3/2012. plates were fixed with 10% neutral buffered formalin and removed from biocontainment. the drugs with >50% inhibition of Spike expression and 30% toxicity were then screened with SARS-CoV. duplicate Vero E6 cells were seeded into white opaque 96-well plates. cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C for 48 h and then mock infected or infected with SARS-CoV (MA15) at an MOI of 1. a third identical drug compound plate was used to assess drug toxicity in the absence of SARS-CoV. percent Normal = (T V)/(N V), where T represents the number of cells infected with SARS-CoV but vehicle treated, and N represents the number of the normal control cells that are neither infected nor treated with compound. after normalization, average activity values were calculated between replicate measurements along with 1. the MERS-CoV titers on Vero E6 cells were determined by plaque assay. all procedures using live MERS-CoV were performed under biosafety level 3 conditions at the IRF. dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was used as a solvent for the high-throughput screening assay described below. 290 compounds were selected for screening against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV based on antiviral activity observed in screens against other RNA viruses. cells in 100 l DMEM plus 10% FBS per well were added to 3 cell plates in 50 l. the DMSO concentration was kept at 0.05% or lower. plates were pretreated with drugs for 1 h before plates were transferred. 174 of 290 drugs were screened against SARS-CoV, including all the hits that blocked MERS-CoV (72 drugs) the assay used to screen for inhibition of SARS-CoV replication was different from the one used for MERS-CoV replication due to differences in equipment for analysis at UMB. raw phenotype measurements (T) from each treated well were converted to normalized fractional inhibition, I, by the formula I = 1 (T/V), relative to the median, V, of vehicle-treated wells arranged around the plate. the calculation used to measure the antiviral activity of the compounds was the Percent Normal. 72 compounds were active against MERS-CoV (>50% inhibition) with no or low cytotoxicity (30% toxicity) in the secondary screen, the 72 compounds were plated at eight doses for confirmation of antiviral activity against MERS-CoV as well as to determine EC50s in the MERS-CoV ELISA. s and 19% (33 of 174) for SARS-CoV inhibitors can be explained by the fact that the library was enriched for compounds that have shown antiviral activity against other viruses. a cathepsin inhibitor blocked both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. onaviruses (26) identified only a small number of drugs that seem to inhibit only SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV. primarily anti-inflammatories interfere with cell signaling associated with the immune response to virus infection. rol metabolism inhibitor 12.203 15.327

MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV at an MOI of 0.1 or 1, respectively, and treated for 48 h with eight doses of dasatinib (A) or imatinib mesylate (B). antiviral activity is shown in blue, and cytotoxicity is shown in red. EC50s are indicated. chlorpromazine hydrochloride and triflupromazine hydrochloride strongly inhibit MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV with micromolar EC50s (range, 5.76 M to 12.9 M) no significant difference was observed between the effects of these drugs on MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. both imatinib mesylate and dasatinib were developed and approved as inhibitors of this pathway for treating human cancers. both imatinib mesylate and dasatinib inhibit SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with micromolar EC50s (range, 2.1 to 17.6 M) and low toxicity (data not shown) toremifene citrate is an estrogen receptor 1 antagonist that inhibits both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV with micromolar EC50s and low toxicity. a primary screen of 290 compounds containing both approved drugs and developmental drugs with defined cellular targets was performed with three-point dose-response curve. 72 compounds were plated at eight doses for confirmation of antiviral activity against MERS-CoV. the 72 compounds were also evaluated for their antiviral activity against SARS-CoV using a cytopathic effect inhibition assay. a library of 290 compounds was screened at three doses for activity against MERS-CoV. high hit rates of 21% (60 of 290) for MERS-CoV inhibitors and 19% (33 of 174) for SARS-CoV inhibitors can be explained by the fact that the library was enriched for compounds that have shown antiviral activity against other viruses. the library was enriched for compounds that have shown antiviral activity against other viruses. drugs that seem to inhibit only SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, but not both, were discovered. primarily anti-inflammatories interfere with cell signaling associated with the immune response to virus infection. e citrate Estrogen receptor inhibitor 12.915 11.969 Terconazole Sterol metabolism inhibitor 12.203 15.327 Triparanol Sterol metabolism inhibitor 5.283 Anisomycin Protein-processing inhibitor 0.003 0.191 Cycloheximide Protein-processing inhibitor 0.189 0.043 Homoharringtonine Protein-processing inhibitor 0.0718 Benztropine mesylate Neurotransmitter inhibitor 16.627 21.611 Fluspirilene Neurotransmitter cytotoxicity is shown in red. results are representative of one experiment (means standard errosr of the means [SEM]; n = 2). chlorpromazine hydrochloride and triflupromazine hydrochloride have a single chlorine. triflupromazine hydrochloride has three fluorine atoms surrounding a carbon. no significant difference was observed between the effects of these drugs on MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Imatinib mesylate and dasatinib are known inhibitors of the Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 pathway. the ABL1 pathway is involved in cell differentiation, cell adhesion, and the cellular stress response. both imatinib mesylate and dasatinib were developed and approved as inhibitors of this pathway for treating human cancers. toremifene citrate is an estrogen receptor 1 antagonist that inhibits both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV with micromolar EC50s. two of these blocked both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV with micromolar EC50s and low toxicity. screening of 290 drugs identified 27 compounds with activity against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, 33 compounds with activity against MERS-CoV and 6 compounds with activity against SARS-CoV alone. libraries of approved compounds can be used to screen for inhibitors of viruses and have identified a number of potential antivirals. ine kinase signals play an important role in the egress of these viruses. in vivo studies performed in the mouse model of vaccinia virus infection showed that imatinib mesylate was more effective than dasatinib in blocking dissemination of the virus. this was attributed to the immunosuppressive effect of dasatinib (36) toremifene citrate also showed activity in the mouse model of Ebola virus infection (21) antiviral actives in the pharmaceutical class of neurotransmitter receptor antagonists have been developed as antipsychotics, antiemetics, anticholinergics, and antidepressants. this drug is currently approved by the FDA as an antipsychotic. our screen identified 33 MERS-CoV actives. the two largest classes were cytoskeleton inhibitors (8 drugs) and ion channel inhibitors (11 drugs) drugs targeting the cytoskeleton specifically interfere with microtubule polymerization and are antimitotics developed for treatment of cancer. salinomycin was specifically shown to be able to kill human cancer stem cells (45). Interestingly, these compounds affected MERS-CoV but not SARS-CoV. further studies will reveal if these drugs act at a similar step during MERS-CoV infection."}
