{"summary": "MHV strain induces moderate to severe hepatitis in mice (2). replication and the consequent liver pathogenesis depend on the 2\u2032,5\u2032-phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity of the viral accessary protein NS2 (3). BMDC and microglia, brain-resident macrophages, limit NS2H126R replication by activating the OAS-RNase L pathway. the liver is composed of two populations of cells, including approximately 80% liver parenchymal cells (hepatocytes) and 20% nonparenchymal cells (NPC) mouse fibroblasts were cultured as described previously (14, 15) recombinant coronaviruses inf-MHV-A59 (A59) and inf-NS2H126R (NS2H126R) have been described previously (14, 15) cells were centrifuged at 40 g for 3 min at 4\u00b0C. pellet was resuspended in digestion buffer containing 1 mg/ml. cells were placed on plates coated with rat tail collagen (Sigma-Aldrich) KC were recovered by TrpLE select enzyme (Invitrogen) digestion and plated for experiments. the isolation protocol used for the liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) was adapted from previously described methods (17) LSEC and KC were collected from the interface between the two density layers. cells were washed with preservation buffer and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. cells then were plated onto a petri dish and incubated for 8 min. goat anti-RNase L (clone T-16; Santa Cruz) (1:200) as well as anti-GAPDH (anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) (Thermo-Fisher) (1:1,000), goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase (IgG-HRP) (Santa Cruz) (1:5,000), donkey anti-goat IgG- st stain solution (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the medium. hepatocytes (1.5 105 cells per well in 24-well plates), KC (1 105 cells per well in 48-well plates) were infected with A59 or NS2H126R. cells and supernatants were harvested together and then frozen. cell lysates were mixed with 4 Laemmli buffer, boiled at 95\u00b0C for 5 min. proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. membranes were then washed three times with TBST and incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h. inf-MHV-A59 (A59) and inf-NS2H126R (NS2H126R) mice were purchased from the national cancer institute. all procedures were approved by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) mice were bred in the university of Pennsylvania animal facility. cells were centrifuged at 40 g for 3 min at 4\u00b0C. pellet was resuspended in digestion buffer containing 1 mg/ml. cells were placed on plates coated with rat tail collagen (Sigma-Aldrich) KC were harvested by shaking and then selected by binding to a petri dish. the isolation protocol used for the liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) was adapted from previously described methods (17) the pellet was resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. cells then were plated onto a petri dish and incubated for 8 min to remove the KC which attached to the surface. the cells were washed vigorously with ice-cold PBS twice. goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase (IgG-HRP) (Santa Cruz) (1:1,000), donkey anti-goat IgG-HRP (1:5,000) secondary antibodies were used to detect the primary antibodies of the appropriate species. fluorescence was visualized with a Nikon Eclipse 2000E-U fluorescence microscope. images were acquired using Nikon NIS-Element BR software (Nikon) hepatocytes (1.5 105 cells per well in 24-well plates), KC (1 105 cells per well in 48-well plates) or LSEC (5.0 105 cells per well in 48-well plates) were infected with A59 or NS2H126R. cells and supernatants were harvested together and then frozen (80\u00b0C) and thawed three times. cell lysates were mixed with 4 Laemmli buffer, boiled at 95\u00b0C for 5 min. proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. membranes were treated with 5% nonfat milk\u2013TBST blocking buffer for 1 h. membranes were then washed three times with TBST and incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h. hepatocytes were isolated from total liver nonparenchymal cells. KC cells were isolated from total liver nonparenchymal cells. LSEC was isolated from total liver nonparenchymal cells. KC, and LSEC were isolated as described in Materials and Methods. KC and LSEC were stained with mouse anti-human HNF-4 followed by secondary Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (green) DAPI staining (blue) LSEC were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated LDL (green) in serum-free media at 5 g/ml for 4 h. both KC and LSEC limit NS2H126R virus replication by activation of the OAS-RNase L pathway. replication in both these cell types was robust in KC and LSEC. cells were lysed and total cellular RNA was harvested and analyzed for degradation by the use of a bioanalyzer. BMM, hepatocytes, KC, and LSEC were infected with MHV A59 and ns2H126R (MOI = 1). at 12 h (BMM and KC), 13 h (LSEC), or 15 h (Hep) postinfection, RNA was harvested and analyzed by a bioanalyzer for rRNA integrity. the positions of 28S and 18S rRNA are indicated. depletion of KC or LSEC partially restores liver pathogenicity. mice were infected with 200 PFU of virus intrahepatically at 24 h postinjection and sacrificed 5 days postinfection. hepatocytes express undetectable levels of RNase L and OAS. KC and LSEC may have higher basal expression levels of OAS genes than hepatocytes. we hypothesized that KC and LSEC might have higher basal expression levels of OAS genes than hepatocytes. the results are consistent with previous data, in that myeloid cells express higher basal levels of OAS genes. expression levels of OAS1a, OAS2, and RNase L were below the level of detection in hepatocytes. cells were mock treated or treated with IFN- (1,000 U/ml) overnight. cells were lysed, and proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting. KC cells, the resident liver macrophages, were detected by immunostaining for CD68 (Fig. 1D), a KC-specific marker (21). LSEC were isolated from total liver nonparenchymal cells. over 95% of the cells were Alexa Fluor 488 positive. hepatocytes, KC, and LSEC limit NS2H126R replication in vitro. hepatocytes, KC, and LSEC derived from KO mice were infected with NS2H126R. NS2H126R virus replicated to a titer similar to that seen with A59. the replication of NS2H126R is limited in KC and LSEC isolated from B6 mice but not from RNase L/ mice. hepatocytes (Hep) from B6 mice (A), KC from B6 mice (B), KC from RNase L/ mice (C), LSEC from B6 mice (D) and LSEC from RNase L/ mice (E) were infected with MHV A59 and ns2H126R (MOI KC or LSEC were depleted from the livers of B6 mice by intravenous injection of gadolinium(III) chloride (KC depletion) or intraperitoneally injected with 300 mg/kg of cyclophosphamide (LSEC depletion) the depletion of KC was monitored by india ink uptake, which occurs only with KC (24), and the disruption of the endothelial barrier was monitored by morphology as assessed by electronic e were infected with 200 PFU of virus intrahepatically at 24 h postinjection. the data were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney test. hepatocytes express undetectable levels of RNase L and OAS. basal expression of OAS3 was detected in KC but not in hepatocytes and LSEC. however, upon IFN treatment, OAS3 was further induced in KC and detected in LSEC but not in hepatocytes. results consistent with previous data, in that myeloid cells express higher basal levels of OAS genes. LSEC and KC form a barrier between the parenchymal hepatocytes and the blood. previous studies showed that depletion of KC leads to a partial restoration of NS2H126R liver replication. this was the first study to have found that KC and LSEC use the OAS-RNase L pathway during viral infection. a key characteristic of LSEC is fenestration; these cells form pores with diameters of 100 to 200 nm (28) MHV either cannot cross the fenestration or can cross only inefficiently. LSECs represent the first example of nonmyeloid cells in which rRNA degradation and inhibition of viral replication are observed. hepatocytes tightly control the OAS-RNase L pathway, which may protect them from pathogen-induced cell death. a lack of activation of the pathway correlated with low expression of RNase L as well as low levels of basal expression of OAS."}
