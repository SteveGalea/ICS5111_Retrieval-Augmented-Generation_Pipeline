{"summary": "the field of vaccinology provides excellent promises to control different infectious and non-infectious diseases. the term of cancer vaccine refers to a vaccine that prevents either infections with cancer-causing viruses or the development of cancer in certain high risk individuals. several vaccination types are available against different disorders (e.g. cancer) tumor-specific shared antigens and tumor-specific unique antigens have been classified into two broad categories. shared antigens or tumor-associated antigens are expressed by more than one type of tumor cells. a number of TAA are also expressed on normal tissues. the current approach to immunotherapy mainly relies on the role of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) various strategies have been developed to enhance the potency of DNA vaccines such as a) increasing the number of antigen-expressing dendritic cells (DCs) or antigen-loaded DCs, b) improving antigen expression, processing and presentation in DCs. the uptake of DNA plasmids by cells upon injection is very inefficient. both approaches are effective in animal models but have yet to be evaluated fully in human clinical trials. the method of delivering a DNA vaccine can influence the type of immune response induced by the vaccine. the success of intranasally delivered mucosal vaccines has been limited by lack of effective vaccine formulations. however, conventional vaccinations involve subcutaneous or intradermal inoculations. it has been demonstrated that intra-tumoral and/or intra-nodal vaccination may be more effective than other routes. tattooing tattooing has been described as a physical delivery technology for DNA injection to skin cells. it seems to decrease the time that is required for the induction of potent immune responses and protective immunity. a codon modified gene encoding the L1 major capsid protein of the human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) was used as a model antigen. molecular adjuvants substantially enhance the efficiency of the HPV16 L1 DNA vaccine when administered intramuscularly. however, the tattoo delivery of DNA is a cost-effective method that may be used in laboratory conditions when more rapid and more robust immune responses are required. high expression of epidermal growth factor receptor protein was observed in several types of cancer including breast, bladder, colon and lung carcinomas. gene gun administration using gold-coated DNA induced strongest cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity and best anti-tumor effects in lung cancer animal model. gene gun administration using non-coating plasmid DNA induced best anti-tumor effects in lung cancer animal model. pNGVL4a-Sig/E7 (detox)/HSP70 vaccine administered via gene gun generated the highest number of E7-specific CD8+ T cells as compared to needle intramuscular and biojector administrations in mice model [20]. ultrasound Ultrasound (US) can be used to transiently disrupt cell membranes to enable the incorporation of DNA into cells [21,22] electroporation (EP) technology has remained a reliable laboratory tool for the delivery of nucleic acid molecules into target cells. this approach uses brief electrical pulses that create transient \"pores\" in the cell membrane. this allows large molecules such as DNA or RNA to enter the cell's cytoplasm without causing cell death. delivery of plasmid DNA has been shown to be effective as a boosting vaccine in mice primed with DNA alone, possibly owing to the high level of antigen production obtained by the EP-booster vaccine. however, electroporation during priming with the optimal vaccination protocol did not improve AH1-specific CD8+ T cell responses. however, electroporation during boosting strikingly improved vaccine efficiency in mice. the researchers used HPV E6 and E7 tumor antigens to generate an optimal HPV DNA vaccine by codon optimization (Co), fusion of E6 and E7 (E67), addition of a tissue plasminogen activator (tpa) signal sequence, addition of a tissue plasminogen activator (tpa) signal sequence, addition of CD40 ligand (CD40L) or Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 ligand (F vaccination via electroporation generated the highest number of E7-specific cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, which correlated to improved outcomes in anti-tumor effects. electroporation has been successfully used to administer several HPV DNA vaccines to mice model as well as rhesus macaques. DNA vaccine was delivered by intradermal electroporation to treat colorectal cancer. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a CEA DNA immunization approach in patients with colorectal cancer. laser beam can deliver a certain amount of energy (e.g., up to 20 mega electron volts for the first time) onto a target cell, modifying permeability of the cell membrane by a local thermal effect. a further increase in the amount of energy (e.g., up to 250 mega electron volts for the first time) is necessary for therapeutic applications. the most effective immunization protocol may involve priming with one type of immunogen and boosting with another. some of the most effective methods of immunization, like the use of recombinant vaccinia virus or adenovirus, can be applied for only a limited number of times because of host anti-vector responses. recombinant adenoviruses (Ads) are ideal nanoparticles due to their regular geometries. they can be incorporated onto the viral surface with control over their spacing and orientation. this can be used to add reactivity to specific sites of the capsid. the combined gene delivery resulted in three- to four-fold reduction in tumor size in nude mice bearing xenografted thyroid cancers as compared to single IL-12 gene treatment. however, multiple gene delivery via retroviral vectors is rarely applied due to their limited encapsulation capacity. recently, bacteria-based vectors are being investigated as optimal vehicles for antigen and therapeutic gene delivery to tumor cells. the efficacy of PSA-TRICOM has been evaluated in phase II clinical trials in patients with metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer. PANVAC-VF consists of a priming vaccination with rV encoding CEA (6D), MUC1 (L93), and TRICOM plus booster vaccinations with rF expressing the identical transgenes. lipids/liposomes, polysaccharides, cationic polymers, micro-/nano-particles, cationic peptides and cell-penetrating peptides (CPP) non-viral vectors must be able to tightly compact and protect DNA, target specific cell-surface receptors, disrupt the endosomal membrane and deliver the DNA cargo to the nucleus. liposomes/liposomes Lipid-based systems (e.g., liposomes) are commonly used in human clinical trials especially in anti-cancer gene therapy. cationic liposomes are assembled into a bilayer vesicular-like structure (liposomes) because of poor stability, lipoplexes are usually administered directly after their formation. a variety of techniques have been developed for encapsulating both conventional drugs (such as anticancer drugs and antibiotics) and the new genetic drugs (plasmid DNA containing therapeutic genes, antisense oligonucleotides and small interfering RNA) within LNs. these properties include a diameter centered on 100 nm, a high drug-to-lipid ratio, excellent retention of the encapsulated drug, and a long circulation lifetime (> 6 h). a randomized phase II B clinical trial evaluated the effect of Stimuvax on survival and toxicity in 171 patients with stage III B and IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), after stable disease or response to first-line chemotherapy. a cationic lipid DNA complex (CLDC) consisting of DOTIM/cholesterol liposomes and plasmid DNA has been designed. cationic lipid-DNA complex JVRS-100 enters dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages; immunostimulatory DNA binds to and activates Toll-like receptors (TLRs) this agent may induce a strong cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response to co-administered antigen. polysaccharides and other cationic polymers have been recently used in pharmaceutical research and industry for their properties to control the release chitosan and chitosan nanospheres have been reported using a novel and simple osmosis-based method. the most widely studied polymers for gene therapy include poly (L-lysine) (PLL) and polyethylenimine (PEI) cationic polymers may be effective by non-specific stimulation of host immune response to transplanted cells. cellular and humoral immune responses can be elicited to antigens encapsulated in, or conjugated onto PLG microspheres. microspheres elicit CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses by releasing antigen intracellularly. PLGA-based nanotechnology has been widely used in diagnosis and treatment of cancer. NPs have been shown to stimulate the immune response as measured by an increase in IL-2 and IFN- in spleen homogenates. the polymers can offer long-term release of their contents in a pulsatile manner. plasmid DNA encodes HPV E6/E7 antigens. the capsule is formed from polymeric PGLA microparticles. these microparticles have a greater propensity toward APC uptake compared to naked DNA. this technique allows HPV DNA to be condensed inside the microparticle. multi-functional nano-devices based on dendritic polymer or dendrimers can also be applied to a variety of cancer therapies to improve their safety and efficacy. new applications of dendrimers in photodynamic therapy, boron neutron capture therapy, and gene therapy for cancer are being examined. electrolytes including incorporation of ligands into the DNA-polyelectrolyte shells were mixed with Pluronic F127 gel and polyethylenimine. nanoparticles/liposomes containing epidermal growth factor receptor vaccine include mannan-modified recombinant adenoviral EGFR vaccine, mannan-modified liposome recombinant EGFR gene and protein vaccine; b) nano vaccines prepared by two applications of CPP already validated in vaccine studies are delivery of tumor-associated antigens into antigen-presenting cells. the used CPP, attached cargo, concentration and cell type, all significantly affect the mechanism of internalization. the mechanism of internalization and subsequent processing still remains controversial. soluble Tat-antigen conjugates can deliver the antigen directly to the MHC class I processing pathway. soluble Tat-antigen conjugates can deliver the antigen directly to the MHC class I processing pathway and increase the generation of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in vivo [73,74]. a Tat-derived peptide in combination with Quil A generated effective suppression of HPV16-positive C3 tumor outgrowth. this study offers a new strategy for improving subunit cancer vaccines. it includes protection for plasmid DNA, low toxicity and significantly enhanced transfection efficiency under in vivo conditions. VP22 can form compacted complexes with short oligonucleotides and form particles of spherical nature with a size range of 0.3 to 1 m in diameter. VP22 enables spreading of the antigenic peptide to the cells surrounding the transfected cells. VP22 has been used for HPV16E7 linked to the VP22. bovine herpesvirus VP22 (BVP22) and Marek's disease virus VP22 (MVP-1) are closely related by their structural homology to HSV-1 VP22, and can also have a significant role in intercellular spreading. in vivo experiments, the recombinant adenoviruses Ad5CMVp53 and Ad5CMVp53-VP22 were constructed. hepatitis B core particles, human papillomavirus VLPs and parvovirus VLPs displaying T-cell specific epitopes from another protein on their capsid. chimeric VLPs can be used to enhance E7-specific cellular immune responses in mice. chimeric VLPs can be used to enhance E7-specific cellular immune responses. polyomavirus VP1 VLPs (89,90) or HPVL1 VLPs (91,92) are able to mediate delivery and expression of plasmid DNA in vitro. a potentially important role for L2 has been identified in facilitating DNA delivery and expression in vitro. ND10 sites are known to contain RNA polymerase II, and CBP, a transcriptional co-activator. ND10 sites are also known to contain RNA polymerase II, and a transcriptional co-activator. ND10 sites are also known to contain RNA polymerase II, and CBP, which supports a transcriptional role for these structures. researchers have developed antigen delivery tools based on cross presentation theory of exogenous antigens for DCs. liposomes [98,99], poly-(-glutamic acid) nanoparticles [100] and cholesterol pullulan nanoparticles [101] can deliver antigen into DCs via an endocytosis mechanism. valbumin was directly delivered into the cytosol but not via the endocytosis pathway. the combination of BLs and US exposure is a promising antigen delivery system in DC-based cancer immunotherapy. targeting nanoparticles (NPs) to DCs provides a promising strategy for developing an efficient protective immune response. DCs were pulsed with synthetic peptides that represent cytotoxic T-lymphocyte epitopes of HPV16 E7. the goal was to determine the safety and induction of the immune response using these vaccinations. NPs can contribute to a better design of medical applications by a controlled release of a specific agent. a method has recently reported for the incorporation of an immunostimulatory CpG oligonucleotide into the polymer backbone of the particles. these particles were designed to degrade in the acidic environment of endosomal vesicles and release their protein as well as a CpG-polymer conjugate capable of binding TLR9, an endosomal receptor for un-methylated viral and bacterial DNA. many designs for delivering antigenic peptides and adjuvants have been explored. the route of administration and the specific vaccine formulation will have a profound effect on factors such as peptide orientation and structure. the mucosal immune system has been established as an ideal target site for vaccines. ization usually favors the development of mucosal antibodies and cell-mediated immune responses. the efficacy of a vaccine is dependent on whether the administered agents can survive into the gastric and intestinal environments, including pH-induced degradation, enzymes, and diffusion across mucus layer. cellular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a promising approach for this purpose. it relies on cell-to-cell transfer of super-paramagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) from tumor cells to endogenous APCs. MRI is capable of monitoring, in vivo, the trafficking of magnetically labeled APCs inducing a tumor-specific immune response. DNA vaccines have been successfully directed against a wide variety of tumors, almost exclusively by driving strong cellular immune responses in an antigen-specific fashion. however, there is still a need to improve the delivery of DNA vaccines and increase the immunogenicity of antigens expressed from the plasmids. non-viral and non-biological delivery systems (non-physical delivery methods) such as: 2.1. Cationic lipids/liposomes 2.2. Polysaccharides and cationic polymers 2.3. Micro-/Nano-particles 2.4. Cationic peptides/Cell-penetrating peptides (CPP) I. the sequential use of primary vaccination subcutaneously followed by booster vaccination intra-tumorally produced more effective anti-tumor effects than the use of either route alone [3]. biolistic and needle injections may produce different types of immune responses. tattooing of 20 g DNA results at least ten times lower peak values of gene expression than intramuscular injection of 100 g DNA in mouse model [15]. despite lower dose of DNA and decreased gene expression, DNA delivered by tattoo induced higher antigen-specific cellular and humoral immune responses than that by intramuscular needle injection [15]. gene gun technology has been developed as a non-viral method for gene transfer into various mammalian tissues. particle-mediated or gene gun technology has been developed as a non-viral method for gene transfer into various mammalian tissues. gene gun is a biolistic device that enables delivered DNA to directly transfect keratinocytes and epidermal Langerhans cells. the effect of the CpG motif was observed to switch the Th2-type cytokine microenvironment produced by gene-gun bombardment in draining lymph nodes. the addition of the CpG motif can increase IL-12 mRNA expression in draining lymph nodes. the CpG motif can act as a 'danger signal' and an enhancer of Th1 immune response in DNA vaccination. ultrasound (US) can be used to transiently disrupt cell membranes to enable the incorporation of DNA into cells. this system has been applied to deliver proteins into cells, but not yet to deliver antigens into DCs for cancer immunotherapy. the technique of ultrasound can aid in the transduction of naked plasmid DNA into colon carcinoma cells. EP-mediated delivery of plasmid DNA has been shown to be effective as a boosting vaccine in mice primed with DNA alone. a comparison of ultrasound versus electroporation (EP) showed that EP can significantly enhance the transfection efficiency of naked plasmid DNA into skeletal muscle against ultrasound. in vivo electroporation mediated vaccination is a safe and effective modality for the treatment of prostate cancer. phPSA vaccine therapy significantly delayed the appearance of tumors. co-administration of the synthetic CpG with phPSA increased anti-tumor responses. the optimal construct, tFE67(Co), was generated by using tpa signal sequence, Flt3L, fusion of E6 and E7 and codon optimization. this induced 23 and 25 times stronger E6- and E7-specific CD8+ T cell responses than those of initial E67 fusion construct. this vaccine regimen induced 34- and 49-fold higher E6- and E7-specific CD8+ T cell response, respectively, as compared to responses observed following vaccination with E the vaccine is proposed to be given to patients with a history of CIN 2 and 3 that have been treated by surgery [18]. VGX-3100 is a therapeutic DNA vaccine being given to individuals already infected with hepatitis C virus to clear the infection by boosting a cell-mediated immune response. a phase I dose escalation trial of plasmid interleukin (IL)-12 electroporation was carried out in patients with metastatic melanoma. the results indicated that the modality was safe, effective, reproducible and titratable. tattooing has been described as a physical delivery technology for DNA injection to skin cells. this approach seems to decrease the time that is required for the induction of potent immune responses and protective immunity. this effect might be related to the rapid and highly transient nature of antigen production after vaccination. a codon modified gene encoding the L1 major capsid protein of the human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) was used as a model antigen. molecular adjuvants substantially enhance the efficiency of the HPV16 L1 DNA vaccine when administered intramuscularly. however, the tattoo delivery of DNA is a cost-effective method that may be used in laboratory conditions. gene gun administration using non-coating plasmid DNA induced strongest cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity and best anti-tumor effects in lung cancer animal model. the addition of the CpG motif can increase IL-12 mRNA expression in draining lymph nodes. this can act as a 'danger signal' and enhancer of Th1 immune response in DNA vaccination. a pNGVL4a-Sig/E7 (detox)/HSP70 vaccine has been used in clinical trials. the vaccine encoding a signal sequence linked to an attenuated form of HPV16 E7 (E7 detox) and fused to heat shock protein 70 [Sig/E7detox/HSP70] has been used in clinical trials. electroporation (EP) technology has remained a reliable laboratory tool for the delivery of nucleic acid molecules into target cells. this approach uses brief electrical pulses that create transient \"pores\" in the cell membrane, thus allowing large molecules such as DNA or RNA to enter the cell's cytoplasm. a comparison of ultrasound versus electroporation (EP) showed that EP can significantly enhance the transfection efficiency of naked plasmid DNA into skeletal muscle against ultrasound. this regimen was more effective than the one consisting of two doses of DNA with EP. effective priming and tumor protection in mice are highly dependent on vaccine dose and volume. electroporation during priming with optimal vaccination protocol did not improve AH1-specific CD8+ T cell responses. optimal HPV DNA vaccine by codon optimization (Co), fusion of E6 and E7 (E67), addition of a tissue plasminogen activator (tpa) signal sequence, addition of CD40 ligand (CD40L) or Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 ligand (Flt3L) tFE67(Co) was generated by using tpa signal sequence, Flt3L, fusion of E6 and E7 vaccination via electroporation generated the highest number of E7-specific cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, which correlated to improved outcomes in anti-tumor effects. electroporation has been successfully used to administer several HPV DNA vaccines to mice as well as rhesus macaques. DNA vaccine was delivered by intradermal electroporation to treat colorectal cancer. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a CEA DNA immunization approach in patients with colorectal cancer. laser beam can deliver a certain amount of energy (e.g., up to 20 mega electron volts for the first time) onto a target cell, modifying permeability of the cell membrane by a local thermal effect. for therapeutic applications, a further increase in the amount of energy (e.g., up to 250 mega electron volts) is necessary. live vectors (attenuated or non-pathogenic live virus or bacteria) are most common gene delivery tools used in gene therapy. most effective immunization protocol may involve priming with one type of immunogen and boosting with another. some of the most effective methods of immunization can be applied for only a limited number of times because of host anti-vector responses. recombinant adenoviruses (Ads) have enormous potential for gene therapy. they are extremely efficient at delivering DNA to target cells, can infect both dividing and quiescent cells, have a large capacity for incorporation of cDNA expression cassettes, and have a low potential for oncogenesis because they do not insert their genome into the host DNA. the combined gene delivery resulted in three- to four-fold reduction in tumor size in nude mice bearing xenografted thyroid cancers as compared to single IL-12 gene treatment. however, multiple gene delivery via retroviral vectors is rarely applied due to their limited encapsulation capacity. bacteria-based vectors are being investigated as optimal vehicles for antigen and therapeutic gene delivery to tumor cells. the efficacy of PSA-TRICOM has been evaluated in phase II clinical trials in patients with metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer.

PLGA polymers can offer long-term release of their contents in a pulsatile manner. in the past, their utilization primarily focused on replacement with multiple immune boosting administrations typically required to induce protective immunity. the capsule is formed from polymeric PGLA microparticles. these resulting microparticles have a greater propensity toward APC uptake compared to naked DNA. the physical and chemical properties of the PGLA scaffold render DNA inaccessible to nuclease and preventing degradation. nano-devices based on dendritic polymer or dendrimers can also be applied to a variety of cancer therapies to improve their safety and efficacy. new applications of dendrimers in photodynamic therapy, boron neutron capture therapy, and gene therapy for cancer are being examined. nanoparticles/liposomes containing epidermal growth factor receptor vaccine. mannan-modified recombinant adenoviral EGFR vaccine, mannan-modified liposome recombinant EGFR gene and protein vaccine. mannan-modified liposome recombinant EGFR gene and protein vaccine. polypeptides will recognize and bind to cell surface receptors that are unique to target cells and deliver the bound DNA into the cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis. this process may ensure the therapeutic effect in desired cells and limit the potential side effects caused by transgene expression in non-target cells. cationic nanopeptide is known to be a transfection enhancer of plasmid DNA. soluble Tat-antigen conjugates can deliver the antigen directly to the MHC class I processing pathway. soluble Tat-antigen conjugates can deliver the antigen directly to the MHC class I processing pathway. a Tat-derived peptide in combination with a PEG-PEI copolymer could be a promising candidate as gene delivery vehicle intended for pulmonary administration. a new approach to non-viral gene carrier for lung therapy includes protection for plasmid DNA, low toxicity and significantly enhanced transfection efficiency under in vivo conditions. VP22 can form compacted complexes with short oligonucleotides and form particles of spherical nature with a size range of 0.3 to 1 m in diameter. VP22 enables spreading of the antigenic peptide to the cells surrounding the transfected cells. VP22 has been used for HPV DNA vaccines targeting the E6 protein. bovine herpesvirus VP22 (BVP22) and Marek's disease virus VP22 (MVP-1) are closely related by their structural homology to HSV-1 VP22. mice vaccinated with DNA encoding MVP22/E7 significantly increased number of IFN--secreting, E7-specific CD8+ T cell precursors compared to mice vaccinated with wild-type E7 DNA alone. the most effective immunization protocol may involve priming with one type of immunogen and boosting with another. some of the most effective methods of immunization can be applied for only a limited number of times because of host anti-vector responses. recombinant adenoviruses (Ads) have enormous potential for gene therapy. they are extremely efficient at delivering DNA to target cells, can infect both dividing and quiescent cells, have a large capacity for incorporation of cDNA expression cassettes. adenoviral vectors can deliver high antigen concentrations, promote effective processing and MHC expression, and stimulate potent cell-mediated immunity. retroviral vector was encapsulated with genetic segment bearing both IL-12 and herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) genes. the combined gene delivery resulted in three- to four-fold reduction in tumor size in nude mice bearing xenografted thyroid cancers. however, multiple gene delivery via retroviral vectors is rarely applied due to their limited encapsulation capacity. each vaccine consists of the transgenes for PSA, including an agonist epitope, and three immune co-stimulatory molecules. the efficacy of PSA-TRICOM has been evaluated in phase II clinical trials in patients with metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer (mHRPC) non-viral vectors include cationic lipids/liposomes, polysaccharides and cationic polymers, micro-/nano-particles, cationic peptides and cell-penetrating peptides. non-viral vectors must tightly compact and protect DNA, target specific cell-surface receptors, disrupt the endosomal membrane and deliver the DNA cargo to the nucleus. loxamer CRL1005 and the cationic surfactant benzalkonium chloride resulted in a stable complex that elicited the efficient antigen-specific cellular and humoral immune responses. cationic lipids/liposomes Lipid-based systems (e.g., liposomes) are commonly used in human clinical trials especially in anti-cancer gene therapy. a variety of techniques have been developed for encapsulating both conventional drugs (such as anticancer drugs and antibiotics) and the new genetic drugs (plasmid DNA containing therapeutic genes, antisense oligonucleotides and small interfering RNA) within LNs. if the LNs possess certain properties, they tend to accumulate at sites of disease, such as tumors, where the endothelial layer is 'leaky' cationic peptides must be able to tightly condense DNA into small, compact particles. target the condensate to specific cell surface receptors; 3) induce endosomal escape. cationic lipid DNA complex (CLDC) consisting of DOTIM/cholesterol liposomes and plasmid DNA. cationic lipid-DNA complex JVRS-100 enters dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages. immunostimulatory DNA binds to and activates Toll-like receptors (TLRs) this agent may induce a strong cytotoxic T-lymphocyte response to co-administered antigen. polysaccharides and other cationic polymers have been recently used in pharmaceutical research and industry for their properties to control the release of antibiotics tylated chitin and the commercial product has an average molecular weight ranging between 4 and 20 kDa. it contains several amino groups that may undergo protonation leading to its solubilization in water. chitosan may also establish electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged DNA to form complexes (polyplexes) cationic polymers may be effective by non-specific stimulation of host immune response to transplanted cells. cellular and humoral immune responses can be elicited to antigens encapsulated in, or conjugated onto PLG microspheres. microspheres elicit CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses by releasing antigen intracellularly.

ND10 sites are also known to contain RNA polymerase II, and a transcriptional co-activator, which supports a transcriptional role for these structures. optical imaging approach has been designed to directly visualize the trafficking of simian-human immunodeficiency (SHIV) VLPs. in dendritic cell-based cancer immunotherapy, it is important that DCs present peptides derived from tumor-associated antigens on MHC class I, and activate tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes. however, MHC class I generally present endogenous antigens expressed in the cytosol. DCs were treated with ovalbumin (OVA) as a model antigen. BLs and US exposure effectively induced OVA-specific CTLs. this resulted in the complete rejection of E.G7-OVA tumors. exosomes derived from DCs loaded with tumor peptides induce anti-tumor immune response with a final eradication of established tumors. NPs can contribute to a better design of medical applications by a controlled release of a specific agent with more efficient and specific targeting. microparticles greatly enhance the efficacy of MHCI antigen presentation and subsequent activation of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) these particles were designed to degrade in the acidic environment of endosomal vesicles and release their protein as well as a CpG-polymer conjugate capable of binding TLR9, an endosomal receptor for un-methylated viral and bacterial DNA. many designs for delivering antigenic peptides and adjuvants have been explored. the route of administration and the specific vaccine formulation will have a profound effect on factors such as peptide orientation and structure. the route of administration and the specific vaccine formulation will have a profound effect. oral or respiratory immunization usually favors the development of mucosal antibodies and cell-mediated immune responses. the efficacy of a vaccine is dependent on whether the administered agents can survive into the gastric and intestinal environments, including pH-induced degradation, enzymes, and diffusion across mucus layer. non-invasive techniques for monitoring in vivo antigen capture and delivery. the use of cellular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a promising approach for this purpose. both viral and non-viral vectors were developed and evaluated for delivering therapeutic genes into cancer cells. many viruses such as retrovirus, adenovirus, herpes simplex virus, adeno-associated virus and pox virus have been modified to eliminate their toxicity and maintain their high gene transfer capability."}
