{"summary": "a diagnostic strategy that clarifies these uncertainties could enable personalized asthma treatment and mitigate antibiotic overuse. results Of 46 subjects enrolled, 7 were clinically adjudicated as bacterial, 18 as viral, and 21 as noninfectious. antibiotics are not standard of care for asthma exacerbations, and several trials have shown no benefit to the use of macrolides for asthma exacerbations. despite this, 22% of patients presenting to the emergency room and 58% of patients hospitalized for asthma receive antibiotics. traditional pathogen-based approaches have limitations, including sampling bias, time-to-result, and inability to distinguish infection from colonization. RADICAL enrolled subjects with acute respiratory illness of suspected bacterial, viral, or noninfectious etiology. subject medical history, clinical data, and patient-reported symptom scores were recorded. subjects also reported sick contacts and duration of illness. adjudicators could still make a classification of \u201csuspected bacterial\u201d or \u201csuspected viral\u201d infection if the clinical presentation was consistent with such an etiology. each case was independently reviewed by two physicians. the model created 3 separate classifiers: bacterial versus non-bacterial, viral versus non-viral, and infectious versus non-infectious. the fixed-weight classifiers were then applied to a cohort of patients with acute asthma exacerbations of various etiologies. clinical findings assessed included those routinely available at the time of clinical evaluation: vital signs, white blood cell count, and radiography. total RNA was extracted using PAXgene Blood miRNA kit (Qiagen). RNA quantity and quality were assessed by nanoDrop Spectrophotometer and Aligent 2100 Bioanalyzer. a complementary DNA library was generated from total RNA using SuperScript VILO MasterMix. the asthma validation cohort was measured in an independent TLDA experiment. we included technical replicates in both training and validation TLDA experiments. the specific clustering algorithm used was T-distributed stochastic neighbor with a perplexity parameter of 10. RADICAL developed a host response-based diagnostic assay to discriminate bacterial from viral infection. subject medical history, clinical data, and patient-reported symptom scores were recorded. symptom scores included nasal discharge, nasal congestion, sneezing, cough, malaise, throat discomfort, fever/chills, and headache. the validation cohort included 46 subjects with asthma exacerbation adjudicated as having bacterial, viral, or noninfectious triggers. both the training cohort and validation cohort were retrospectively selected from the same pool of subjects enrolled through CAPSOD, CAPSS, and RADICAL. continuous variables were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis statistical test. binary variables were analyzed with the Fisher\u2019s exact statistical test[21, 22]. Statistical tests were employed using R version 3.5.0[23]. first, raw gene expression results were normalized against two reference probes. the data was used to fit a logistic regression model to perform both classification and target weight selection using the R package \u201cglmnet\u201d[28]. Specifically, we performed nested cross validation to select parameters. the viral group exhibited lower illness severity, as inferred from hospital admission rates (39% for viral vs. 100% for bacterial and 48% for noninfectious), and were younger (mean 42 years) compared to the bacterial (54 years) and noninfectious groups (58 years) an independent validation cohort of 46 subjects with asthma exacerbation was identified (Table 1). of these, 7 subjects (15%) were clinically adjudicated as having a bacterial infection, though none had confirmatory microbiology. influenza and rhinovirus most frequently identified (7 cases each) clinical data from asthma exacerbation cohorts. ening, reticular markings, adenopathy, and nodules. symptom scores across clinically adjudicated phenotypes. 0 indicating not present and 4 indicating \u201cvery severe\u201d. most symptoms were similar between groups. only two reached statistical significance. set of asthma exacerbations clinically adjudicated as bacterial. only one had a gene expression signature consistent with bacterial infection. 83.3% were identified as viral by gene expression. gene expression identified 23.8% as bacterial and 14.3% as viral. two adjudicated bacterial cases were classified as viral by the model. one had patchy airspace consolidation on x-ray and the other had a clear x-ray. four subjects were adjudicated as bacterial and classified as noninfectious by the model. dicted phenotype, antibiotics were prescribed more frequently in cases with viral and noninfectious signatures than cases with bacterial signatures. oseltamivir was prescribed for 9 individuals despite only a third testing positive for influenza. an independent validation cohort of 46 subjects with asthma exacerbation was identified. 7 subjects (15%) were clinically adjudicated as having a bacterial infection. none had confirmatory microbiology. influenza and rhinovirus most frequently identified (7 cases each) 25 subjects (46%) were adjudicated as having a noninfectious asthma exacerbation etiology including medication noncompliance, seasonal allergies, smoking/illicit drug use, and dust exposure. terial (n = 7) 36.8 (35.8\u201338.2) 91 (86\u201397) 14 (5.9\u201321.7) 100% Viral (n = 18) 37.2 (35.6\u201338.8) 96.8 (89\u2013100) 9.4 (5.9\u201315.9) 38% *CBC was not obtained in all individuals. 100% of the bacterial cohort, 83% of the viral cohort, and 43% of the noninfectious cohort had a CBC ordered on admission bacterial versus non-bacterial, viral versus non-viral, and noninfectious versus infectious. cross validation within the training cohort revealed accurate discrimination between bacterial, viral, and noninfectious. etiology, 83.3% were identified as viral by gene expression. gene expression identified 23.8% as bacterial and 14.3% as viral. clinical adjudication groups were stratified by gene expression class. two adjudicated bacterial cases were classified as viral by the model. one had patchy airspace consolidation on x-ray and the other had a clear x-ray on enrollment but lobar infiltrates on repeat imaging two days later. four subjects were adjudicated as bacterial and classified as noninfectious. antibiotics were prescribed more frequently for subjects with viral and noninfectious signatures than for subjects with bacterial signatures. the rest were negative for all viruses on clinical respiratory virus testing (n = 4), or did not undergo clinical respiratory virus testing (n = 2). our study is the first use of a host gene expression classifier to identify infectious and noninfectious causes of asthma exacerbation. many other studies have used gene expression profiling to better understand asthma pathogenesis. if clinical intuition were perfect, there would be no need for additional diagnostic tests. the prior success of procalcitonin to guide antibiotic use is tempered by recent studies raising some doubts. one large meta-analysis estimated only 77% sensitivity in sepsis. another study showed 67% sensitivity in discriminating bacterial and viral infection. asthma exacerbations often occur in younger individuals, but our cohort was largely adult. however, the signatures used for this study were previously evaluated in both adult and pediatric patients, showing no significant difference based on age[16]."}
