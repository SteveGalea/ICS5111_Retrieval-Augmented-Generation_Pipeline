{"summary": "in humans, IFITM1, -2, and -3 are expressed in a wide range of tissues, while IFITM5 expression is limited to osteoblasts. gene analysis of chickens has predicted the existence of two IFITM genes, orthologous to human IFITM10 and huIFITM5 (9). IFITM proteins are the only mediators of innate immunity known to inhibit viral infection by blocking cytoplasmic entry and replication of diverse enveloped viruses. IFITM-mediated viral restriction occurs at entry sites of susceptible viruses, in the late endosomal and lysosomal compartments. mice lacking Ifitm1, -2, -3, -5, and 6, suggesting IFITM3 accounts for most of the antiviral activity of this locus for the viruses investigated. direct clinical relevance of IFITM3's involvement in restricting human IAV infection has recently been shown in individuals hospitalized with seasonal or pandemic influenza H1N1/09 viruses. chicken IFITM1 (chIFITM1) and chIFITM3 gene sequences were synthesized as codon-optimized genes for expression in human cells. chicken IFITMs were synthesized as codon-optimized genes for expression in human cells. lentivirus vector stocks were made by a three-plasmid transfection of HEK293T cells, grown to confluence in a 10-cm dish. 200 l of Opti-MEM (Gibco) was mixed with 10 l of Fugene-6 (Roche) before adding 1 g of a gag-pol-expressing vector (p8.91), 1 g of a vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (p cells were resuspended with anti-HA antibody conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and incubated for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. cells were resuspended with 100 l PBS and transferred to a 96-well V-bottomed plate. cell lines were seeded at 3 103 cells/well in 96-well plates 1 day prior to infection with either green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing pseudotyped lyssaviruses. RABV challenge virus standard 11 (CVS-11; GenBank accession no. EU352767) and Lagos bat virus (LBV) luciferase activity, as a measure of lentivirus infection, was determined at 48 h postexposure using 50 l Bright-Glo reagent (Promega) the cells were allowed to lyse for 2 min before the level of luciferase activity was measured using the FLUOstar Omega (BMG Labtech) cDNA from each tissue was amplified by PCR using primer sets. material to be assayed was serially diluted in serum-free DMEM. after 1 h of incubation, the cells were overlaid with DMEM. chicken and human IFITM genes were synthesized as codon-optimized genes for expression in human cells. all IFITM genes were cloned into the BamHI and NotI sites of the lentivirus vector, pSIN-BNHA (20), and sequences confirmed by capillary sequencing. the medium was removed from the cells and replaced with 8 ml of DMEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum. the DNA mixture was added dropwise to the cells. the lentivirus vector was harvested 48 and 72 h after transfection. transfected cells were harvested using 300 l 0.25% trypsin-EDTA. cells were resuspended in 100 l of PBS and transferred to a 96-well plate. cells were resuspended with anti-HA antibody conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) luciferase-expressing influenza viruses were determined by fluorescence microscopy at 48 h postinfection following fixation (20 min) with 4% (vol/vol) paraformaldehyde (USB) and permeabilization (10 min) using 0.3% Triton X\u2013PBS. cells were washed with 100 l of PBS-Hoechst solution (200 ng/l) d at 5 104 cells/well in a 24-well plate and transfected with a small interfering RNA (siRNA) against chIFITM3 (GCGAAGTACCTGAACATCACG) or a nonspecific siRNA (UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUGU) the cells were stimulated by addition of either 200 ng/ml of chicken IFN- (RP0115c; Kingfisher Biotech) or chicken IFN- (PAP00 the cells were fixed with 4% formal saline\u2013PBS solution for 20 min before being stained with 0.1% toluidine blue solution. RNA was DNase treated, and reverse transcription was carried out. cDNA from each tissue was amplified by PCR using following primer sets. the putative IFITM5 gene is located next to an uncharacterized gene (ENSGALG00000006478) with which it shares 30% amino acid identity. the telomeric -1,4-N-acetyl-galactosaminyl transferase 4 (B4GALNT4) gene and the centromeric acid trehalase-like 1 (ATHL1) gene flank the antiviral IFITM 1, 2, -3, and -5 gene block in mamma all of the chIFITM paralogues are comprised of two exons. the location of the intron-exon boundary is conserved across all of the chicken IFITM genes. the genome contains an intact IFITM locus with four putative IFITM genes flanked by the genes B4GALNT4 and ATHL1. a number of conserved chIFITM family motifs are present in some of the chicken sequences. multiple sequence alignments also reveal important amino acids in the chicken IFITMs that help categorize each sequence as either IFITM1 or IFITM2/3. the alignment also reveals that other functionally significant amino acids are conserved in some of the chicken IFITM sequences. human IFITM1, -2, and -3 localize distinctly in the cell. IFITM1 is predominantly cell surface expressed and IFITM2 and -3 are predominantly intracellular. chIFITM3 shares synteny, amino acid similarity, and subcellular localization with huIFITM3. chicken IFITM proteins restrict diverse virus infection. we investigated if, despite considerable amino acid sequence divergence, chicken IFITMs could function as restriction factors. we then compared the level of antiviral restriction of chicken IFITM2 and -3 to that of their orthologous human proteins in A549 cells. chIFITM3 and huIFITM3 only share 42% amino acid identity. level of viral restriction of chIFITM3 is similar to that in huIFITM3. lack of stability at high expression levels is supported by Hach et al. the expression levels of each cell line are shown by Western blotting (C) relative to endogenous B-actin. the stable cell line expressing chIFITM3 was infected with a pseudotyped virus expressing a luciferase reporter gene. overexpression of chIFITM3 in DF-1 cells reduced viral replication by an average of 55%. chIFITM3 has an antiviral activity in DF-1 chicken cells. the effect of knocking down endogenous chIFITM3 expression was measured by flow cytometry using an antibody against nucleoprotein (NP) (B) expression of chIFITM2 and -3 was detected in all tissues. lower levels of expression in the muscle and brain and higher levels in the cecal tonsils. expression of chIFITM1 was more restricted and confined to the bursa of Fabricius and the cecal tonsil. BLAST hits span the exons of genes designated chicken IFITM3-like (NCBI, LOC422993; GenBank accession no. XM_420925.4) and IFITM1-like (NCBI, LOC422993; GenBank accession no. XM_001233949.3) this region is syntenic with the IFITM gene cluster on human chromosome 11 (A) this region is syntenic with the IFITM gene cluster on human chromosome 11 (A) the colored columns in the sequence alignment (B) show residues that are shared between all nine IFITM sequences from humans, chimps, and chickens. Tyr20 is conserved in all primate IFITM2 or -3 sequences and is also present in chicken \u201cIFITM1-like\u201d (NCBI) but none of the other IFITM1 orthologues. this further supports our assessment of this gene as an IFITM2 or -3 gene, and by synteny, the gene is IFITM3. chIFITM1 was diffusely expressed throughout the cytoplasm. chIFITM2 localized perinuclearly, consistent with huIFITM3. chIFITM3 shares synteny, amino acid similarity, and subcellular localization with huIFITM3. overexpression of chIFITM3 resulted in 79.4% and 85% reductions in infection of A549s to lentivirus vectors pseudotyped with the lyssavirus envelope of LBV. chIFITM2 also restricts lyssavirus LBV and RABV infection to a similar level as chIFITM3. an increase in the expression of chIFITM3 is associated with a decrease in viral infection. a range of clonal A549 cell populations expressing increasing levels of chIFITM3 protein (bars A to G) were assessed by Western blotting of the HA tag. DF-1 cells abundantly express chIFITM3 (threshold cycles [CTs] of 20 for IFITM3 and 22 for GAPDH) addition of IFN- resulted in only a moderate induction, whereas addition of IFN- caused a 2.67-log2 (6.4-fold) increase in chIFITM3 expression. expression level and log fold change of chIFITM3 were measured using quantitative RT-PCR. the effect of knocking down endogenous chIFITM3 expression was measured by flow cytometry using an antibody against nucleoprotein (NP) (B) expression of HA and NP was detected by flow cytometry (C and D), and viral titers were measured by PFU (E). RT-PCR was performed without reverse transcriptase (RT) to control for genomic DNA contamination. the antiviral activities of the IFITM2 and IFITM3 proteins have only been demonstrated in mammals. a single report characterizing the function of chicken IFITM1 and IFITM5 (2) suggests the IFITM gene family is present throughout vertebrates. chIFITM2 and chIFITM1 are flanked by the genes ATHL1 and B4GALNT4 (9) the locus is flanked by the genes ATHL1 and B4GALNT4 (9) this suggests the duck retains four IFITM genes at a conserved locus. avian influenza virus (A/duck/Hubei/49/05 and A/goose/Hubei/65/05), levels of expression of duck IFITM3, -5, and -10 (measured by RNAseq) increased to various degrees, reflecting a response befitting their expected function (27). RABV is responsible for approximately 70,000 human deaths each year (28), while other lyssaviruses have only been conclusively shown to cause a handful chIFITM proteins expressed in DF-1 chicken cells constitutively express chIFITM3 and huIFITM3 effectively restrict the entry of all lyssavirus and IAV envelope pseudotypes tested. however, certain key amino acids in the N terminus, IM1, and CIL domain are conserved in chicken and human IFITM3."}
