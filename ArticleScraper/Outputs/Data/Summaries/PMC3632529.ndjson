RNA and DNA were automatically extracted with RNeasy and QIAamp DNA mini kits respectively. the secondary structure of circovirus genome was predicted with the mfold Web Server. all partial and full genome sequences of selected viruses have been deposited in the GenBank Sequence Reads Archive under accession numbers SRA059263 and SRA05929. the collection and sampling of bats for this study was approved by the Administrative Committee on Animal Welfare of the Institute of Military Veterinary, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, China. issue Samples and Extraction of Viral Nucleic Acids Briefly, bat organs and tissues (laryngopharynx, trachea, lung, heart, liver, spleen, stomach, gut, kidney and bladder) of each of the 4 groups were pooled and homogenized in a blender (Waring, Torrington, CT) with SM buffer (50 mM Tris, 10 mM MgSO4, 0.1 M NaCl, pH7.5) the four 20-nucleotide barcode DNAs were designed online (http://www.changbioscience.com/primo/primor.html) each group of nucleic acids was added separately to the four barcode primers (10 M) Mixtures were heated at 65\u00b0C for 5 min and cooled on ice for 2 min. ddH2O was denatured at 94\u00b0C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C denaturing for 30 s, 55\u00b0C annealing for 30 s, 68\u00b0C extending for 1 min with final 68\u00b0C extension for 8 min. ddH2O was then inactivated at 75\u00b0C for 10 min. amplicons were bound to a flow cell to which was then added fluorescent-labeled dNTPs. the sequences were separated by their barcodes and then assembled into contigs with SOAPdenove software. the significant data were aligned online against the nonredundant and viral reference databases of GenBank with BLASTx and BLASTn. positive PCR products were sequenced in both directions commercially by an ABI 3730 DNA Analyzer. two near full genomes of bat bocaviruses were constructed with a genome walking kit (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. the virome of the bats in the study comprised viruses of vertebrates, insects, plants and bacteria. the remaining 26,698 (2%) contigs were annotated to eukaryotes and bacteria respectively. the remaining 26,698 (2%) contigs were matched to viruses according to the defined cutoff value. 433 3,965 419,167 Total 187,177,789 3,742,314 1,649,512 88% 114 33,501 19,940 26,698 1,569,373 a XM: M. fuliginosus from Sedon County; WO: other species bats from Wutao County; XM: M. fuliginosus from sedon County; XO: other species bats from sedon County; XO: other species bat Retroviridae Deltaretrovirus 0 22 0 1 23 Parvoviridae Dependovirus 0 0 0 4 4 Bocavirus 9 0 11 0 20 Astroviridae Mamastrovirus 35 0 0 22 57 Picornaviridae Kobuvirus 1 0 1 1 3 Enterovirus 0 1 0 0 1 Flaviviridae Hepacivirus 0 0 0 1 Subtotal 172 100 11,587 227 like virus 5 0 13 32 50 Phieco32-like virus 0 0 13 0 13 N4-like virus 0 0 1 0 1 P22-like virus 0 0 53 29 82 T7-like virus 39 220 825 1,149 2,233 Siphoviridae C2-like virus 0 0 1 2 3 lambda-like virus 2 0 3 1 6 T1-like virus 12 9 131 81 233 T5-like virus 1 virus, bocavirus, parvovirus, mamastrovirus, kobuvirus, iflavirus, had strong BLAST bit to viruses with bit score >200 and e value 10e20. herpesvirus-like contigs had diverse nt identities to known viruses. longest reads with 210 nt sharing the highest nt identity of 70% with human herpesvirus 6B. the iflavirus was present in, and Iridoviridae absent from, M. fuliginosus of both counties. alpha- and betabaculoviruses within the Baculoviridae, and bracovirus and ichnovirus within the polydnaviridae were first time discoveries in bats. 95 contigs of plant viruses were identified for the first time in bats. genus Mamastrovirus is composed of 19 viral species based on the ORF2 gene [48]. the taxonomic tree of the 19 species of Mamastroviruses based on a partial ORF1b gene was the same as that based on ORF2. astroviruses detected in this study could be further grouped into two branches with 57\u201363% nt identity between them. RT-PCR of all bat organs targeting 369 nt at the 3\u2032 end of the single ORF confirmed results of Solexa sequencing. 18% (56/320) of guts of M. fuliginosus in WM and 8% (26/320) of M. fuliginosus in XM were positive for the genus Iflavirus. ten amplicons with lengths of 620 nt were sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed against representative sequences of bocaviruses identified to date. results showed that newly identified bat bocaviruses were significantly divergent from known bocaviruses. the highest aa identity (53%) observed was with canine minute virus and only 43% aa identity with M. myotis bocavirus. the highest (54%) aa identity was with canine bocavirus HK882U. the highest (54%) identity was with canine bocavirus HK882U but only 40% to Myotis myotis bocavirus 1, with the same results obtained by analysis of VP1. gene sequence of bat adeno-associated viruses and other representatives with Muscovy duck parvovirus as outgroup. the sequences in our study are identified by filled triangles and those of bat bocavirus and adeno-associated viruses from previous studies by open triangles. covirus (CV) CVs contain a circular genome of 1,700\u20132,000 nt length. it encodes a replication-associated protein (Rep) and a capsid protein (Cap) in opposing directions. 7% (6/92) of guts of R. ferrumequinum in group XO were circovirus positive. the sequences in our study are identified by filled triangles, those from previous studies by open triangles. the sequences are identified by filled triangles, those from previous studies by open triangles. the highest circovirus identities BtCV XOR1 and BtCV XOR7 shared were only 56% with canine CV strain NY214 identified in 2012 and 70% to PCV-1. PCR Amplification of bat hepadnavirus Members of family Hepadnaviridae have a compact circular genome. all viral sequences could be classified into 24 viral families: 13 dsDNA, 2 ssDNA, 2 retro-transcribing, 1 ssRNA plus stranded and 1 dsRNA. the remaining 26,698 (2%) contigs were matched to viruses according to the defined cutoff value.

PCR Amplification of adenovirus The members of the family Adenoviridae infect a wide range of vertebrates including mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and fish. only one contig showing identity with genus Mastadenovirus was found in group WO. two complete genomes (BtCV XOR1, BtCV XOR7; accession numbers JX863737 and KC339249 respectively) were amplified by inverse PCR. sequence revealed that BtCV XOR1 and XOR7 DNAs were respectively 1,862 nt and 1798 nt in length and contained two ORFs in opposite strands. Phylogenetic analysis of BtCVs based on the complete aa sequence of Rep protein with other representatives. the sequences in our study are identified by filled triangles, those from previous studies by open triangles. PCR Amplification of bat hepadnavirus Members of family Hepadnaviridae have a compact circular genome. in our study, >10,000 hepadnavirus-like contigs were detected in all four groups through viral metagenomics. the 423 bp amplicons of partial S genes of 7 selected bat hepadnaviruses showed >97% nucleotide identity with each other, 77% nucleotide identity with WHV and 7 alian viruses, along with a number of unknown viruses, have been identified in last two or three years by a few laboratories. a virome of Myanmar bats comprises 24 viral families capable of infecting vertebrates, insects, plants or bacteria. 4% of all bats were mammalian viruses, much higher than rates reported in previous virome studies. mixed tissue samples are likely to provide a more complete virome profile. bat viromes have been studied in 3 american states and 10 Chinese provinces. each of the 853 bat samples was subjected to RT-PCR or RT-PCR for 6 selected viruses. results were completely consistent with that of the metagenomic analysis. none of the bat samples tested positive for coronavirus by RT-PCR screening using published method [60], this may be due to insufficient bat sampling and limited locations. PCR and RT-PCR screening also revealed the prevalence rates of selected viruses in the bat virome. astv, CV, Adv and CV sequences were not investigated in previous studies. three species within the genus Rhinolophus (R. pusillus) in china have been found to harbor CVs. hepadnavirus-like contigs were the second largest population. PCR and sequencing of a partial S gene sequence showed that the bat hepadnavirus identified here had approximately equal identity with WHV and HBV. this suggests that it should be classified as a new species in genus Orthohepadnavirus. only 48% identity with BtCV YN-BtCV-2 (No. JF938079) there are currently the only two members in the genus Bocavirus and share 43% sequence identity. bocaviruses were first identified in the 1960s, and can cause respiratory, gastrointestinal and reproductive diseases. more novel bat Astvs were detected that diverged from the current 19 Astv species, indicating that these form new species within the genus Mamastrovirus. the continuing emergence of new mamastrovirus species and their wide genetic divergence in bats indicates that there could still be more unknown bat astroviruses."}
