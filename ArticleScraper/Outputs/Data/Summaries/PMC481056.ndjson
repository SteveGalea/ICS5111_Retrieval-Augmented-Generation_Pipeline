{"summary": "a software package, Base-By-Base, has been developed that provides visualization tools. it allows users to quickly and easily compare large viral genomes. it highlights small differences that may be responsible for important phenotypic differences. poxvirus genomes range in size from 150\u2013380 kb and encode several hundred proteins. there are now more than 30 completely sequenced poxvirus genomes available from GenBank. the largest genome (30 kb) of all RNA viruses and 99 isolates of the SARS virus completely sequenced. software has the ability to easily and quickly answer a database query. no software existed that could display all nucleotide differences between variola virus strain 1 and variola virus strain 2. a second problem associated with the alignment of closely related, large virus genomes is that the available software makes occasional small errors. a user initially accesses the application (client) from a web page using Java Web Start. it also automatically downloads the application from the host server computer whenever a new version is available. the native file format of BBB is based on the bioinformatics Sequence Markup Language (BSML) [11] standard. the annotations for viral genomes in a BBB alignment are read into BBB from a GenBank file or from a VOCs database. the gene annotations are required by BBB to generate the tabular summary of the differences between genomes that details the effect of nucleotide changes on the genes and predicted proteins. the native file format of BBB is based on the bioinformatics Sequence Markup Language (BSML) [11] standard. it stores sequence alignment, gene features and other user-defined annotations. XML is also highly interoperable since it has as its root a plain text file. results and discussion Editing and display of sequence differences in real-time BBB is primarily intended to be a sequence analysis tool focused on genome sequence comparisons. the program provides similar functionality to other editors such as GeneDoc [15] and BioEdit [16]. the consensus sequence generated from an alignment can also be saved to a file (FASTA format) for analysis with other software. it was discovered that it was important to have the flags that highlight nucleotide differences updated in real-time. 3-frame translations of the DNA sequences can be displayed in the main sequence alignment window to help with alignment decisions. methionines (green) and stop codons (red) are highlighted on the 3-frame translations, as are the genes associated with individual sequences through annotations in the BBB file. a tool was created in BBB that allows the user to add comments to different regions of one or more sequences in an alignment. these comments can be color coded, labeled with text and hidden or viewed in the main window as required. basic gene information is listed in a table, including start/stop positions, strand and length, followed by: 1) number of nucleotide differences counted and categorized as substitutions, deletions and insertions. a single deletion event removing 12 nucleotides creates larger effect in the percent difference table than 6 single substitution events that could affect 6 different amino acids. this type of adaptation of a virus to a particular environment/host occurs at a much higher frequency than the acquisition of novel genes/promoters derived from the host or other viruses. this type of adaptation occurs at a much higher frequency than the acquisition of novel genes/promoters derived from the host or other viruses. similarity shading styles, scored with BLOSUM62 and PAM250 matrices, are available for analyzing protein sequences that might not be similar enough for the default parameters. a grey scale indicates similarity (black-perfect match; white-low) and gaps are shown as dashes. regular expression and fuzzy motif searches are often necessary to search through viral genome sequences for restriction sites, primer sequences and other patterns. a fuzzy motif search capability was also implemented in BBB that allows a user-selected number of mismatches. data connectivity BBB has been designed to accommodate large virus genomes. alignments are read into BBB from FASTA or ClustalW format alignment files. they are then converted to the native BBB file format. users have found it convenient to maintain a series of alignment files. BBB provides a button to allow the user to skip through a sequence from one flagged nucleotide difference to the next. the difference data represents differences between each adjacent pair of sequences or to a consensus sequence calculated by BBB. the sequence differences indicated on the screen are those differences between each sequence and the consensus sequence. this allows for a global view of the alignment and easily identifies conserved/variable regions. the consensus sequence generated from an alignment can also be saved to a file (FASTA format) for analysis with other software. a new BBB window displays the new local alignment. forward and backward 3-frame translations of the DNA sequences can be displayed in the main sequence alignment window. the user is offered the option to import this new local alignment back into the original complete genome alignment. users can toggle on/off the display of sequence difference flags, sequence-numbering scales, user annotations. this feature is especially useful for alignments of 30 sequences or more. a tool was created in BBB that allows the user to add comments to different regions of one or more sequences in an alignment. a single deletion event removing 12 nucleotides creates larger effect in the percent difference table than 6 single substitution events that could affect 6 different amino acids. a region of 200 nucleotides upstream of each gene is also analyzed for differences. determine which few genes have differences in the promoter regions. this type of adaptation of a virus to a particular environment/host occurs at a much higher frequency than the acquisition of novel genes/promoters derived from the host or other viruses. this type of adaptation of a virus to a particular environment/host occurs at a much higher frequency than the acquisition of novel genes/promoters. similarity shading styles, scored with BLOSUM62 and PAM250 matrices, are available for analyzing protein sequences that might not be similar enough for the default parameters. similarity shading styles, scored with BLOSUM62 and PAM250 matrices, are available for analyzing protein sequences that might not be similar enough for the default parameters. a tabular report of the percent identity between all pairs of sequences in the alignment can be exported as a tab-delimited file for convenient importing into a spreadsheet or table in a word processor. regular expression and fuzzy motif searches are often necessary to search through viral genome sequences for restriction sites, primers and other patterns. allowing 2 mismatches in 2 SARS coronavirus genomes. upper panel, search results window with hits sorted by confidence. lower panel, hits displayed as black arrows in sequence alignment window. data connectivity BBB is designed to accommodate large virus genomes. the site maintainer only has to save the BBB file to the appropriate WWW directory. this feature also provides access to the summary display without the need to download BBB or learn how to run the software. BBB is written in Java and has been tested on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. it is freely available for use under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL)"}
