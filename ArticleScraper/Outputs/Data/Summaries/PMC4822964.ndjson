{"summary": "coronaviruses include the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus that caused outbreaks of respiratory disease in humans in 2002\u20132003 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus identified in 2012. contemporary work suggests that bat and bird species are the natural reservoirs of coronaviruses. the primary site of PEDV replication is the cytoplasm of villous enterocytes throughout the small intestine. infection causes epithelial cell degeneration and villous atrophy, which leads to diarrhea, dehydration, and prolonged shedding of PEDV in feces. sows with higher anti-TGEV SIgA levels in milk were better able to protect their piglets against clinical TGE [19, 25\u201327]. this concept is primarily derived from research showing that sows with higher anti-TGEV SIgA levels in milk were better able to protect their piglets against clinical TGE [19, 25\u201327]. PEDV inoculum was isolated from piglet small intestine from an Indiana swine farm. infection in 5-day-old piglets was reported as 0.056 TCID50. infection caused watery diarrhea at 1 DPI, virus shedding in feces at 4 DPI. flask was inoculated with 0.5 ml of a mixture of PEDV and post-inoculation medium. flasks were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 2 h. contents were harvested, centrifuged at 3,000 x g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. the experiment was conducted in the Iowa State University Livestock Infectious Disease Isolation Facility (LIDIF) the facility was equipped with a single-pass non-recirculating ventilation system that provides directional flow from low contamination areas to high contamination areas. each room was ventilated separately and humidity and temperature was strictly controlled. seven clinically healthy pregnant sows were acquired from one commercial sow farm at day 110 of their second gestation. 1 ml iron hydrogenated dextran (VetOne\u00ae, Boise, ID) and 5 mg (0.1 ml) ceftiofur sodium (Excenel\u00ae, Zoetis) swine serum proteins and serum antibody (IgG and IgA) were precipitated by single fractional precipitation using 30% and then 40% ammonium sulfate. concentrated antibody solution was aliquoted into 50 ml centrifuge tubes and stored at -80\u00b0C until used. antibody solution was thawed at 22\u00b0C for 2 h and then 2-fold diluted with PBS (1X pH 7.4) to create 6 treatments. treatment was administered by intraperitoneal inoculation at the rate of 1.35 ml of the solution per kg of piglet bodyweight. piglets were assigned to treatment using randomized block design whereby all treatments were assigned to each litter. animals unable to suckle, reluctant to stand, or demonstrating 10% dehydration based on skin tenting were euthanized by intravenous administration of pentobarbital sodium. blood samples were drawn from the jugular vein or cranial vena cava using a single-use blood collection system. blood samples were processed by centrifugation at 1,500 x g for 15 min. Approximately 1 gram of feces was collected from each piglet using a disposable fecal loop (VetOne\u00ae), mixed with 1 ml PBS (1X pH 7.4, Sigma-Aldrich) immediately after collection, placed in a 2 ml cryogenic tube. viral RNA was extracted from 100 l of fecal swab samples and eluted into 90 l of elution buffer using the Ambion\u00ae MagMAX sow fecal swab samples were tested for PDCoV using a membrane (M) gene-based rRT-PCR described in Chen et al. (2015). the protocol included positive control standards of known infectivity titers. Coronavirus antibody assays PEDV indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) plates were prepared by inoculating confluent monolayers of vero cells (ATCC\u00ae CCL-81TM) at 1 x 103 plaque-forming units/ml. plates were then incubated for 18 to 24 h, after which the inoculum was removed and the cell monolayers fixed with cold acetone:alcohol (70:30) solution (Sigma-Ald the virus was pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 140,992 x g for 3 h. the purified virus was resuspended in PBS (1X pH 7.4) at a dilution of 1:100 of the original supernatant volume and stored at -80\u00b0C. plates were washed 5 times, blocked with 300 l per well of a blocking solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin. 100 l of peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-pig IgG (Fc) antibody diluted 1:20,000 for serum and colostrum/milk samples or goat anti-pig IgA (Bethyl Laboratories Inc.) diluted 1:3,000 for serum and 1:45,000 for colostrum/milk samples was added to each well. after 5 min incubation, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 l of stop solution (1 M sulfuric acid 5 l Rennet was added to 1 ml of defatted milk or colostrum. mixture was then incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min, vortexed, and centrifuged at 2,000 x g for 15 min. test samples, antibody-positive control serum, and antibody-negative control serum were heat inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 30 min. then, 75 l of each dilution was transferred to new dilution plate. negative neutralizing endpoints were determined as the highest dilution. plates in which the positive control deviated more than 2-fold from its expected antibody titer were considered invalid. time to death was analyzed using proportional hazard regression analyses. piglets (n = 62) from 6 PEDV indirect fluorescent antibody-negative sows were intraperitoneally administered concentrated serum antibody sufficient to achieve one of 6 targeted levels of circulating anti-PEDV antibody. each day, sow milk and piglet fecal samples and data on piglet clinical signs, body weight, and body temperature were collected. virus shedding in feces at 4 DPI and villous atrophy within 4 DPI. inoculum used in this study was 7th passage of the virus on cell culture. virus was serially propagated on vero cells in flasks using methods described elsewhere. flasks were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 until cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed. contents were harvested, centrifuged for 10 min at 4\u00b0C to remove cell debris. contents were stored in -80\u00b0C until used. sow fecal swabs tested for PEDV, TGEV, and PDCoV. all sows had been bred on the same day. all sows were administered 10 mg of dinoprost tromethamine. 2 sows were humanely euthanized and exsanguinated to collect whole blood. serum was harvested and stored in 1 L bottles at -20\u00b0C. mixture was centrifuged (4\u00b0C) at 4,000 x g for 10 min to remove protein aggregates. concentrated antibody solution was thawed at 22\u00b0C for 2 h and then 2-fold diluted with PBS (1X pH 7.4) to create 6 treatments. piglets were randomized to treatments in a randomized block design using statistical software R (R 3.2.0, R foundation) 7c 2 12 1 1 3 3 3 2 2 Totals 74 12 12 13 13 12 12 a Piglets were assigned to treatment using randomized block design. b Treatment 1 piglets served as negative controls. c Litter 7 was excluded because the sow was agalactic. 2 sows were humanely euthanized and exsanguinated to collect whole blood. the serum was thawed for 24 h at 4\u00b0C, the volume of saturated ammonium sulfate (Sigma-Aldrich) calculated to achieve 30% concentration was added in a drop-by-drop fashion while stirring continuously. concentrated antibody solution was thawed at 22\u00b0C for 2 h and then 2-fold diluted with PBS (1X pH 7.4) to create 6 treatments. piglets were blocked by sow and randomized to treatments in a randomized block design using statistical software R. b Treatment 1 piglets served as negative controls. c Litter 7 was excluded because the sow was agalactic. PEDV inoculation A virulent U.S. PEDV isolate was used as the challenge virus in this study. blood samples were processed by centrifugation at 1,500 x g for 15 min. defatted samples were then aliquoted into 2 ml cryogenic tubes. blood samples were drawn from the jugular vein or cranial vena cava. blood samples were processed by centrifugation at 1,500 x g for 15 min. defatted samples were then aliquoted into 2 ml cryogenic tubes. samples were stored at -20\u00b0C until tested. Coronavirus primers and probes Sow fecal swab samples and piglet fecal samples were tested for PEDV using a PEDV nucleocapsid (N) gene-based rRT-PCR described in Madson et al. (2014). primers and probes targeting conserved regions of the PEDV N gene were designed to match a U.S. PEDV nucleotide sequences. the protocol included positive control standards of known infectivity titers. the forward primer, reverse primer, and probe were designed to match the M gene of global and U.S. PDCoV isolates. sow fecal swab samples were tested for PDCoV using a spike (S) gene-based rRT-PCR described in Kim et al. (2007). the protocol included positive control standards of known infectivity titers (TCID50) real-time RT-PCR The eluted RNA, primers, and probe were mixed with commercial reagents (Path-ID\u00ae Multiplex One-Step RT-PCR kit, Life Technologies) results were analyzed using an automatic baseline setting with a threshold at 0.1. the plates were rinsed 3 times with PBS (1X pH 7.4) and 50 l of 1:50 diluted with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) labeled mouse monoclonal antibody was added to each well. the cells were observed under an inverted fluorescent microscope for PEDV-specific cytoplasmic staining. ELISA conditions for detection of anti-PEDV IgA and IgG antibodies in serum and colostrum/milk (defatted) specimens were identical. plates were incubated at 25\u00b0C for 1 h and then washed 5 times with PBST wash solution. the antibody response in serum and colostrum/milk samples was represented as sample-to-positive (S/P) ratios. for serum, S/P ratios 0.80 were considered positive for PEDV IgG antibody. ilutions of 1:8 to 1:1024, and incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 1 h. cells were fixed with 80% cold acetone:alcohol (80:20), stained with FITC-conjugated monoclonal antibody. positive neutralizing endpoints were determined as the highest dilution. serum samples were serially two-fold diluted (1:40 to 1:320) in PBS (1X pH 7.4) and then 100 l of each dilution was transferred to IFA plates and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. the plates were rinsed 3 times with PBS (1X pH 7.4) and 50 l of 1:50 diluted with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) labeled mouse monoclonal antibody was added to each well. plates were washed 5 times, blocked with 300 l per well of a blocking solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin. plates were then dried at 37\u00b0C for 4 h and stored at 4\u00b0C in a sealed bag with desiccant packs. ELISA conditions for detection of anti-PEDV IgA and IgG antibodies were identical. the reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 l of stop solution (1 M sulfuric acid) to each well. the antibody response in serum and colostrum/milk samples was represented as sample-to-positive (S/P) ratios. 75 l of each dilution was transferred to new dilution plate (Axygen\u00ae, Corning\u00ae), mixed with 75 l of PEDV (1 x 103.6 TCID50/ml) to give final serum dilutions of 1:8 to 1:1024, and incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 1 h. cells were fixed with 80% cold acetone:alcohol (80:20), stained with FITC-conju a 2 group (antibody-positive vs. antibody-negative) model was run. percent change in body weight for any DPI was calculated relative to DPI -4. the qualitative effect of PEDV infection body temperature was assessed. one sow and her litter were eliminated from the study on DPI 6. the remaining 6 sows were clinically normal throughout the study. no significant difference in survival piglets was detected among the 6 litters. the highest concentration of virus in feces was observed between DPI 2 and 4. all fecal samples from piglets in the antibody-negative control group were positive through DPI 12. no significant difference in body temperature was detected with treatment defined as 6 groups. a comparison based on 2 groups showed a significant difference in body temperature. piglets with body temperature below the lower bound of the normal range were observed. serum samples collected on DPI 0, i.e., 24 h post treatment, had FFN antibody titers ranging from 1:8 to 1:32 and ELISA S/P ratios of 0.2 to 3.3 (IgA) and 0.5 to 1.4 (IgG) the PEDV antibody response on DPIs -4, 0, and 14 was analyzed using the Wilcoxon rank test. the 7 sows farrowed a total of 74 liveborn pigs, 3 stillborn pigs, and 4 mummified fetuses. each piglet litter was kept intact and remained with its dam throughout the study. serum samples collected on DPI -7 had PEDV WV IgG ELISA S/P ratios between 0.2 and 0.6. by DPI 14, milk S/P ratios ranged between 0.4 and 2.0. rRT-PCR positive on DPI 1, with all samples positive on DPI 2. the highest concentration of virus in feces was observed between DPI 2 to 4. negative fecal samples were recovered from 40% (n = 6) of antibody-positive pigs on DPI 14. body temperature data collected on DPIs -4 to -1 showed a mean piglet body temperature of 39.3\u00b0C with a 95% confidence interval of 38.6\u00b0C to 40.1\u00b0C (\"normal range\" piglets with body temperature below the lower bound of the normal range were observed from DPI 1 through 12. the PEDV antibody response on DPIs -4, 0, and 14 was analyzed using the Wilcoxon rank test. no significant differences in FFN, IgA, and IgG serum antibody responses were detected in treated versus control groups on DPIs -4 and 14. most treatment groups had significantly higher antibody responses relative to antibody-negative piglets (treatment 1) on 0 DPI. passive antibody model was previously used to study maternally-derived humoral immunity in mice [37\u201339], rats [40] and hamsters [41]. passive antibody provided protection against clinical rotaviral infection. intraperitoneal injection of PRRSV antibody sufficient to achieve serum neutralizing antibody titers of 1:16 inhibited PRRSV replication in 2 - to 5-week-old pigs [46\u201347]. the size of the experiment was limited by the number of piglets within treatments and the physical and logistical requirements of daily observations, sampling, and handling. a PEDV viremia lasting at least 7 DPI has been reported in young pigs inoculated under experimental conditions. the results are compatible with previous reports for swine coronaviruses. mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) effected by interactions between antibody and other components of the immune system, e.g. complement, phagocytic cells, and natural killer cells. ADCC kills antibody-coated infected cells by inducing the expression of cell death-inducing molecules. the optimal protection to piglets will be provided by dams able to deliver both high antibody titers in colostrum and high titers of secretory IgA in milk."}
