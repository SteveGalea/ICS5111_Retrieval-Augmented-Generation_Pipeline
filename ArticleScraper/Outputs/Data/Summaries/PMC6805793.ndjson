{"summary": "acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) is the primary cause of child morbidity and mortality worldwide. the vast majority of childhood deaths related to ALRI occur in resource-limited settings. in rural areas, the true community-based burden of respiratory virus-associated ALRI remains poorly characterised. the aims of this analysis were to characterise the transmission of nine non-influenza respiratory viruses within households in rural southern Nepal. the study site is in the low-lying region of rural southern Nepal called the \u2018terai\u2019, with inhabitants broadly representative of the population of india, Bangladesh and Nepal. a mid-nasal turbinate swab was collected from mothers and other adult household members aged 15 years with self-reported fever. swabs were collected from all children 15 years with at least one of the following symptoms within the previous 7 days: subjective fever, cough, draining ear, wheezing or difficulty breathing. a hemi-nested PCR protocol was used targeting the 5\u2032 untranslated region and the second hypervariable region of the attachment (G) glycoprotein coding region for HRV and RSV respectively [22, 23]. Sequences were aligned using MAFFT v7.309. maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were inferred using PhyML 3.1 within Geneious [24, 25]. regression was performed by including all measures significant in the univariable analysis at P 0.1. a single index case type was included in the multivariable model. potential risk factors for transmission included maternal and household characteristics. the first participant enrolled in the household substudy began on 14 April 2011. the household ended 180 days after birth. a mid-nasal turbinate swab was collected from all children 15 years. samples were tested by a real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for 12 respiratory viruses, including RSV, MPV, influenza viruses A and B, parainfluenza virus 1\u20134 (PIV 1\u20134), adenovirus (AdV), human coronavirus (CoV), HRV and bocavirus. the 14-day risk period began on the first day of criteria respiratory symptoms associated with virus-positive specimen collection. each initial infection and its corresponding risk period comprise a single data point in the regressions and include subsequent infections and time at risk. 752 households were enrolled with a median household size of 9 (range 2\u201331) within the 555 surveyed households, 3232 out of 5521 (59%) initially enrolled household members were surveyed for weekly respiratory illness. a total of 825 virus-positive initial illness episodes occurred within 362 households with a median of one (range 0\u201310) illness episode per household. a total of 825 virus-positive initial illness episodes occurred within 362 households with a median of one (range 0\u201310) illness episode per household. a total of 79 transmission events in 68 household illness episodes resulted in a PCR-confirmed secondary case within the household. the incidence of a PCR-confirmed transmission event of any virus occurring in the 14 days following initial infection was 1.14 transmissions per 100 person-weeks. preschool age children were the second most common secondary case in 30 (38%) any-virus transmission events. transmission events 13 8 43 4 1 4 13 2 0 79 Transmission incidence per 100 p-weeks 1.53 1.09 0.93 0.43 0.38 2.71 2.19 0.96 0 1.14 Median (IQR) Household members, follow-up within 14 days of index infection 4 (3, 6) 4 (3, 6) 6 (3, 9) 5 (3, 7) 4 (4, 7) 6 (4, 6) 5 (3, 6) 4 (3, 6) 4 (3, 5) 7 (4, 13) Media 5 (38.5) 1 (50.0) \u2013 33 (41.8) Child 5\u201314 years 2 (15.4) 0 (0.0) 10 (23.3) 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) 2 (50.0) 1 (7.7) 0 (0.0) \u2013 14 (17.8) Other adult 1 (7.7) 0 (0.0) 1 (2.3) 1 (25.0) 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) \u2013 3 (3.8) Secondary cases, n (%) Infant 9 (69.2) 3 (37.5) all initial illness episodes vs. initial episodes resulting in any transmission by proportions and counts.

South Asia is an area of the world with a high incidence of low birthweight infants, household crowding and malnutrition. study highlights importance of targeting preschool-age children to prevent the spread of respiratory viral illness."}
