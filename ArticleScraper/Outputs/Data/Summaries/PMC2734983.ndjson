{"summary": "several outbreaks of infectious diseases in humans linked to such an initial zoonotic transmission have highlighted this problem. factors related to our increasingly globalized society have contributed to the apparently increased transmission of pathogens from animals to humans over the past decades. zoonotic pathogens may need multiple genetic changes to adapt successfully to humans as a new host species. these changes might include enhanced replication, enhanced replication, evasion of innate and adaptive host immune defenses, and/or increased efficiency of transmission. genetic analysis of HIV-1 has provided clues to the geography and time scale of the early diversification of HIV-1 strains when the virus emerged. genome sequences of many host species have become available the last decade. advances in high-throughput sequencing technology and in (bio)informatics and statistics allow us to analyze the networks of gene interactions that control the host response to pathogens. the power of this approach was nicely demonstrated for SIV infection of various primate host species. influenza is transmitted through the air by coughs or sneezes. but influenza can also be transmitted by bird droppings, saliva, feces, and blood. birds and pigs play an important role in the emergence of new influenza viruses in humans. the hemagglutinin of avian influenza A viruses preferentially binds to oligosaccharides that terminate with a sialic acid\u2013-2,3-Gal disaccharide. the hemagglutinins of mammalian influenza A viruses prefer oligosaccharides that terminate with sialic acid\u2013-2,6-Gal. microarray-assisted mRNA expression profiling of emerging zoonotic viral infections, including influenza A virus, is used to phenotype the host response in great detail. researchers can generate a \u201cmolecular fingerprint\u201d of the host response genes or pathways specifically involved in the often-exuberant host responses to the emerging virus. antagonist of the CXCL10 receptor (CXCR3) reduced the severity of the flu symptoms and the viral titers compared to the controls [19], clearly demonstrating the potential of biological response modifiers. the host evasion and evolution of influenza virus is further discussed in [20] researchers have reconstructed the events that led to the emergence of a virus able to spread efficiently in humans [24]. they predicted that the virus had an increased affinity for both civet and human ACE2 receptors due to adaptation. the pathological changes observed in the lungs are initiated by a disproportionate innate immune response. Species-to-species genetic variation in the viral receptor in bats and in the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) gene affects the efficiency with which the virus can enter cells. the virus evolved a high affinity for both civet (center) and human (right) ACE2 receptors (indicated by the single diagonal and the right side vertical arrow) host responses to emerging viruses may also point toward a dysregulated host response to a range of emerging virus infections. this approach may readily reduce the burden of disease and time will be gained to design preventive pathogen specific intervention strategies."}
