{"summary": "our previous donor-derived VSTs were generated using conventional T cell manufacturing strategies. we replaced virus/vector components with clinical grade overlapping peptide libraries spanning immunogenic antigens from each of our 5 target viruses. within 10 days we could reproducibly expand polyclonal T cell lines specific for up to 12 immunogenic antigens from our five target viruses. however, specificity was dependent on donor serostatus. 139 post-transplant there were no immediate infusion-related toxicities. only 1 patient developed de novo GvHD of the skin (grade II) this improved with the administration of topical steroids. all 5 viruses proved sensitive to our adoptively-transferred VSTs. d dendritic cells and pepmix-pulsed EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines are mismatched at 1 or more HLA alleles. the majority of infused lines are mismatched at 1 or more HLA alleles. however, a limited number of clinical studies have shown the promise of this strategy. the cells proved safe in vivo and produced complete or partial responses in 74% of patients infused (74% for CMV, 78% for AdV and 67% for EBV), the majority of which were durable (19). we developed a large bank (>55 lines) from healthy donors with activity against CMV, AdV, EBV, BK and/or HHV6. cell therapy beyond the HSCT setting is to consider if there are other immunocompromised patient populations that would benefit from this therapy. the potential utility of third party VSTs has yet to be explored. the potential utility of third party VSTs has yet to be explored. rejection pre-disposes SOT recipients to a wide range of viral complications. rejection pre-disposes HSCT recipients to a wide range of viral complications. many of the same viruses that afflict HSCT recipients also account for a spectrum of clinical diseases. de Angelis and colleagues knocked down FKBP12 in EBV-VSTs using a small-interference RNA (siRNA) and demonstrated that in the presence of FK506, the \u201cprotected\u201d cells exhibited enhanced proliferation and increased IFN production. this translated to better tumor control in mice engrafted with an EBV-positive lymphoma receiving FK506 intraperitoneally 3 times a week. the majority of patients (n=23) received 4 infusions of cells (at 2106 VSTs/kg) while 1 patient received 6 and 2 received 8 infusions. despite the multiple infusions there were neither infusion-related reactions nor adverse effects on the allograft and allo-antibodies detected. the patient developed a mild fever but no other adverse effects were noted. within 4 months his CMV viral load decreased from >5106 copies to 682 copies/mL and remained controlled up to 1 year. it is likely that VSTs will become an increasingly important means of providing safe and effective anti-viral protection to immune compromised patients."}
