{"summary": "many vertebrate intestines harbor commensal organisms named segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) that bind specifically to the host intestinal epithelium. these organisms appear as long, segmented filaments that bind tightly to the host epithelium via a specialized structure. these bacteria are Gram-positive, spore-forming bacteria that possess the capability to develop into long filaments. the holdfast form serves as the vegetative form, while the spore serves as the dormant form (Chase and Erlandsen, 1976). the spore serves as the dormant form (Reiland, 2016). rodents and longitudinal studies have shown that SFB appear in juvenile mice that are around 20 days in age. at this stage of development, SFB proliferate to become a dominant gut microbe and then recede in mature vertebrates to lower levels. it is believed that the spread of SFB then occurs via vertical transmission of spores from parents to offspring. spores germinate in the host\u2019s gut to produce teardrop-shaped, single-celled bacteria referred to as intracellular offspring. they penetrate the intestinal mucus layer and intimately associate with host cells without invading the host. cellular flagella have not been observed microscopically. symmetric division begins from the distal end to divide each original segment in half into secondary undifferentiated cells. these secondary cells range in length from 1 to 1.7 m, forming segments containing 30\u201380 cells. after elongation, the filament will often separate from the holdfast segment and enter into the ileum. these secondary segments undergo differentiation form a mother cell and a daughter cell. spores lack the ability to colonize the host until favorable environmental conditions are presented. once shed, the spores can be transmitted to another host via horizontal transmission. filaments containing differentiated intracellular offspring only appeared as detached and free-floating. all sequenced SFB genomes have displayed a small genome size of 1.5\u20131.62 Mbp, low G+C content (27.9%) and around 1,350\u20131,400 protein encoding genes (Prakash et al., 2011). the biosynthetic pathways of most amino acids, vitamins and cofactors are incomplete or absent altogether in SFB genomes. a particularly strong requirement for iron uptake was noted by Sczesnak et al., since six different ORFs for iron transporters are found in the mouse genome. the genomes contain genes for the non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway and a complete glycolysis pathway to convert glucose to pyruvate. the genomes of SFB sequenced from mice and rat hosts revealed several clustered regularly interspaced palindromic Repeat (CRISPR) loci. the genomes of SFB sequenced from mice and rat hosts revealed several clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeat (CRISPR) loci. this suggests that SFB genomes may have had exposure to invading DNA throughout their evolutionary history. attempting to colonize an animal species with SFB from another species has been unsuccessful. germ-free mice and rats were inoculated with ileal homogenates containing SFB from both species. fliC3 and flicC4 show greater variability than fliC1 and fliC2. the exact mechanism of host specificity remains unclear. it is believed that initial binding of the holdfast segment to the host epithelium serves as a ligand-receptor interaction, triggering a response from the host. the holdfast binding of SFB to the ileal mucosa does not elicit a strong inflammatory response. several interactions between the host and the host have been investigated. a large amount of research has demonstrated the indispensable role that SFB play in the maturation of the host gut immune barrier. mice colonized with SFB were more resistant to sepsis secondary to cecal ligation. oral vancomycin treatment to mice diminished the number of intestinal Gram-positive bacteria (including SFB), which negatively impacted anti-fungal Th17 immunity in the respiratory tract. Virulent Shiga-toxin producing E. coli and Citrobacter rodentium induced a Th17 response in the murine intestinal tract. virulent Shiga-toxin producing E. coli (O157) and Citrobacter rodentium induced a Th17 response in the murine intestinal tract. neutrophil recruitment may lessen IL-17A and chemokine production. the regulation of these immune-stimulatory compounds and cell types is essential in combatting intestinal colonization and infection from microorganisms. proteins from SFB, secreted or bacterial-associated, are believed to interact with host cells and modulate immunity include ADP-ribosyltransferases and a myosin-cross reactive antigen. the exact antigen presenting cell responsible for immune modulation by SBF is controversial. metabolites from SFB may also impact the differentiation of Th17 cells. SFB flagellar proteins may induce Th17 cells by signaling through TLR5 in a subset of CD11chiCD11bhi intestinal dendritic cells. the flagellar binding motifs that are targeted by TLR5 appear to be highly conserved in SFB. it is unclear whether natural colonization by SFB in poultry is capable of promoting autoimmunity. germ-free mice monoassociated with SFB triggers production of IgA serum levels equivalent to that of specific pathogen free, SFB-negative mice. both T-cell dependent (B-2 cell) and T-cell independent (B-1 cell) production of sIgA occurs in SFB mono-associated mice. a negative feedback mechanism to prevent overcolonization by SFB and dysbiosis in older animals is growing problem facing commercial turkey production in the united states. birds affected by LTS display symptoms similar to poult enteritis complex (PEC) birds do not experience watery and pale intestinal contents or distended ceca. a higher number of different pathogenic organisms are found in these younger birds than in birds aged 4\u20139 weeks. astrovirus, reovirus, and rotavirus types were detected in the host, and are not associated with poult mortality. astrovirus, which is commonly associated with mortality, was not detected in LTS/PES poults. the potential for Candidatus Arthromitus to serve as an immunostimulatory probiotic makes it an organism of great interest. the turkey production industry is in need of alternatives to promote animal health in this age of restricted use of antibiotics in food-producing animals. the role of SFB in turkeys must be better elucidated. the role of commensal microorganisms, like SFB, play in the overall function of the gut microbiome will aid in understanding the interplay between microbiome and host."}
