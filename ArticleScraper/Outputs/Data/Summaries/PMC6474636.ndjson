{"summary": "animals are constantly exposed to animal viruses through the food that we eat, the pets that we keep, and our interactions with nature. however, on rare occasions, an animal virus encounters a human host and begins to replicate itself. the virus will mutate and evolve under the selective constraints of the human body for the first time, adapting and improving itself for replication in this new host. there are 8,615 known species of mammals and 17,413 species of birds. there are over 86,000 mammalian viruses and 174,000 avian viruses in nature. the actual number may be much higher, as high as 1.6 million animal viruses in nature. this essay focuses on the most extreme bottleneck in viral disease emergence: the replication of animal viruses in their first human host. in this essay, we discuss how experimental virology and an understanding of host\u2013virus interactions render clear the reasons for the most extreme bottleneck in this process. zoonosis requires that human-compatible viral variants pre-exist in the animal reservoir. zoonosis requires that human-compatible viral variants pre-exist in the animal reservoir. zoonosis requires that human-compatible viral variants pre-exist in the animal reservoir. the macaque monkey is the most common experimental model for HIV/AIDS research. macaques encode at least five restriction factors that are constitutively expressed. these factors create multiple genetic barriers to HIV in the macaque. dengue virus does not replicate to high titers in any of these animals. in mice, several innate immunity proteins block dengue virus from replicating to high titers. scientists genetically modify mice to lack key immunity pathways. mice can be modified to express human versions of proteins that support virus infection. transgenic mice lack STAT2 or are knocked out for IFN, -, - [35,36] Poliovirus Mouse Cellular receptor PVR Modify mice Create transgenic mice that express human CD81, OCLN receptors, and lack STAT1 [38] Epstein\u2013Barr virus/Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus Mouse Highly species specific in pathogenicity and disease Study mouse virus instead MHV-68 [39] human papillomavirus Mouse in a world of 7 billion people, there are a staggering number of collisions occurring between people and animals every day. human overcrowding has increased the chances that zoonotic viruses will circulate in human populations long enough to be detected. however, only 219 viruses have ever been identified in human infections. nonspecific immune barriers, including skin, mucosa, and chemical defenses, play a key role in blocking animal viruses at portals of entry into the human body. if an animal virus gains access to human cells of its target tissue type, productive replication is far from guaranteed. if the animal virus is successfully recognized by any of these human proteins, this will potently block viral replication. HIV-1 group M derives from a reservoir of SIVs found in african monkeys. chimpanzees first entered african apes via infection of chimpanzees. the virus adapted its vpu gene, which encodes an antagonist of human Tetherin. EC3H drove adaptive change in the viral vif gene encoding the antagonist for APOBEC3 proteins. many people, including many africans, encode APOBEC3H alleles that do not express high levels of protein. it\u2019s possible that these individuals provided a lower adaptive barrier for SIVcpz, giving the virus a foothold in the human population. the viral adaptive mutations acquired during transmission to and between different ape species mapped to capsid. some of the human proteins known to block replication of animal viruses. the final outcome is a highly effective defense against these animals. ACE2 receptor Mutations in viral surface glycoprotein Spike S1 [66,67] b Feline leukemia virus APOBEC3 restriction factor Not yet zoonotic (escape path not yet known) [72] aMutations each virus gained to overcome these barriers in humans. a new virus of chimpanzees called SIVcpz was transmitted to humans. this led to a new virus of chimpanzees called SIVcpz. the virus adapted its vpu gene, which encodes an antagonist of human Tetherin. the key to identifying the animal viruses that are most likely to harm humans boils down to understanding \u201cthick\u201d versus \u201cthin\u201d barriers to zoonosis. virologists are already well on their way to identifying genetic barriers to animal virus replication in humans. animalsb Arenaviridae zoonotic arenaviruses typically associated with rodents Chapare virus Dandenong virus Guanarito virus Junin virus Lassa virus Lassa virus Lujo virus Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus Machupo virus Filoviridae animal associations poorly understood Bundibugyo virus Marburg virus Reston virus Tai Forest virus Ebola virus Hantaviridae zoonotic hantaviruse disease virus Langat virus Louping-ill virus Murray Valley encephalitis virus Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus Powassan virus Rocio virus Sepik virus Wesselsbron virus west Nile virus Yellow fever virus Zika virus Dengue virus 1\u20134 Hepatitis C virus Orthomyxoviridae zoonotic retroviruses typically associated with primates SIVcpz SIVgor Simian foamy virus HIV-1 HIV-2 HTLVs animal viruses are highly unlikely to randomly acquire compatibility with humans when there are many different host blocks to overcome. some of the virus that are currently circulating in the avian reservoir already harbor PB2 mutations that would make them compatible with the human ANP32A [64,73] in every host genome, some genes get trapped into a different mode of evolution in which they are selected for continual sequence change at the protein level. this occurs in genes that are engaged with ever-changing forces in the external world. these types of dynamic external forces can place intense selective pressure on certain classes of host genes, such as odorant receptors and innate immunity genes, to encode proteins with ever-new interaction specificities. avian versions of ANP32A have 33-amino\u2013acid insertion compared to mammalian versions [55] candidate human proteins that are protecting us from animal viruses can be identified bioinformatically, usually by a signature of dN/dS > 1 in their gene sequence. cell-surface receptors are commonly protecting humans from infection by animal viruses. the cocrystal structures are shown for four human cellular receptors (green) in complex with the surface glycoproteins (blue) of four viruses that use these receptors to enter cells. these residue positions are rapidly evolving, which means that each species within these animal groups tend to encode unique amino acids at these positions. the index case was a 2-year-old boy in the village of Meliandou, Guinea. this toddler and other children liked to play in an old, hollowed-out tree. this particular bat species has been found to harbor antibodies to Ebola virus in nature. sequence data from the 2013\u20132016 epidemic revealed the appearance of a new mutation in Ebola virus genomes recovered from infected patients. this mutation caused a single amino-acid change, A82V, in the surface glycoprotein of Ebola virus, which increased viral fusion with human cells via the endosomal receptor NPC1. receptors and innate immunity proteins are prominent examples of proteins that block the replication of animal viruses in humans. villagers reported that the children would regularly catch and play with the bats in this tree. a new ebolavirus, Bombali virus, was recently detected in this same bat species [112]. did a viral variant arise in this tree capable of replicating in humans? mutation caused a single amino-acid change in the surface glycoprotein of Ebola virus. it increased viral fusion with human cells via the endosomal receptor NPC1. adaptation to NPC1 seems to be required during transmission of zoonotic viruses between hosts in multiple directions. if a poorly spreading virus emerged in a densely populated megacity, then it might be capable of continued spread and refinement in humans. unique human situations and behaviors are often factors in defining the scale of epidemics. the strong human desire to care for sick family members has promoted the spread of Ebola virus whenever it strikes. dangerous animal viruses are those that require few mutations to begin replicating themselves in human cells. they are dangerous because the required combination of mutations might randomly arise in the natural reservoir. identifying these dangerous viruses will require significant work, including the integration of viral surveillance with virologic experimentation in the lab."}
