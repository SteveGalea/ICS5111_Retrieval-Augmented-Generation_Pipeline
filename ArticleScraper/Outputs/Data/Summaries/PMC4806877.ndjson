{"summary": "arenaviruses are enveloped viruses with a single-stranded RNA genome. the small (S) segment encodes the nucleoprotein (NP) and glycoprotein (GP) and the large (L) segment encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) and the matrix protein (Z) [6]. arenaviruses are enveloped viruses with a single-stranded RNA genome. ESCRT machinery is required for most cellular membrane scission events. many enveloped viruses hijack cellular ESCRT machinery via their late domains to complete the final membrane scission step required for virions to bud from host membranes. virions from diverse families produce defective interfering (DI) particles. LCMV's sole late domain, PPXY, is not required for standard virus budding. PPXY motif is tyrosine phosphorylated and this post-translational modification appears to regulate DI particle formation. the matrix protein plays a multifactorial role in the arenavirus life cycle. plasmids encoding either WT Z or a phenylalanine mutant (Y88F) that cannot be phosphorylated were transfected into HEK293T cells. the phosphotyrosine signal detected from Y88 was greatly enhanced following inhibition of tyrosine phosphatases. b particles were separated on polyacrylamide gels and stained with Coomassie brilliant blue. a gel slice containing the Z protein was excised, subjected to in-gel tryptic and/or chymotryptic digestion. peptides were analyzed by mass spectrometry for the presence of phosphorylated peptides. LCMV is phosphorylated in rodent cells. L929 cells were infected or not with a rLCMV that encodes a streptavidin binding peptide (SBP) fusion tag at the C terminus of Z. two days later, cells were exposed to either water or the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, H2O2, for 15 minutes. rLCMV Z-Y88F and Z-Y88A viruses containing all three mutations were recoverable despite the well-described defect in Z\u2019s budding efficiency caused by mutation of this residue. the growth kinetics of rLCMV Z-Y88F and Z-Y88A during the first 36 hours (hr) post-infection (pi) were nearly identical, but impaired 15-fold compared to rLCMV WT (P 0.0001; Fig 2 LCMV Z PPXY late domain dispensable for production of infectious LCMV particles. sequence alignment of arenavirus Z proteins reveals conservation of Y88 among most Old World, but not New World, arenaviruses. rLCMV containing substitutions at Z Y88 that either mimic constitutive phosphorylation (Y88E) or cannot be phosphorylated. the LCMV Z protein is sufficient for the production of VLPs in the absence of any other viral proteins. the LCMV Z G2A mutant exhibits a pronounced defect in VLP formation due to its inability to be myristoylated at this glycine residue. y88A mutant confirmed earlier findings by Perez et al. [11]. we did not observe a significant difference between the budding of the Z-Y88E phosphomimetic compared to Y88F and Y88A. this suggests that the partial gain of fitness observed with the phosphomimetic rLCMV-Z-Y88E virus in Fig 2B is not due to an increase in budding activity. levels in the phosphomimetic virus, Y88E, were not significantly different than WT (Fig 3E and 3F), which may explain a component of its partially restored growth kinetics. the PPXY mutants may have defects in their ability to generate DI particles. monolayers inoculated with high concentrations of standard infectious LCMV exhibit no cytopathic effect due to DI particle inhibition. as the inoculum is diluted, standard virus particles that infect cells in the absence of a co-infecting DI particle will subsequently form plaques. PPXY mutant viruses showed significant increase in cytopathology. rLCMV rLCMV (range 25 to 2.5 x 104 PFUs) were inoculated onto monolayers of vero E6 cells. a standard plaque assay was performed. the data in (B) are representative of the mean SEM relative to rLCMV WT. the plaque interference assay was originally used to define LCMV DI particles. it capitalized on the strong UV-resistance exhibited by LCMV DI particles. LCMV DI particles were treated with UV to neutralize standard virus particles while leaving interfering properties of DI particles intact. rLCMV WT and Y88 mutant samples examined in Fig 4 showed substantial DI particle interfering activity (mean 926 PIU50/mL 68 SEM) there was no detectable DI activity for either the Y88F or Y88A viruses while the Y88E virus contained intermediate levels of interfering activity (mean 131 PIU50/mL 64 SEM) rLCMV DI titer is expressed as plaque interfering units50 (PIU50) per mL of a given sample. serial 5-fold dilutions of each UV-LCMV preparation were added to vero E6 cells followed by a fixed amount of 50 PFU of rLCMV WT. dilutions of each UV-treated sample were inoculated onto vero E6 cells. the addition of 50 PFU of standard LCMV impacted the ability of standard LCMV particles to form plaques. for each rLCMV, DI titer is reported as mean PIU50/mL SEM. the cells were washed and fresh media containing the induction agent was added to the cells 6 hr after initial induction. the virus-containing media was collected 18 hr later (72 hr pi) to determine levels of standard infectious particles and DI particles. expression of DN VPS4B had no impact on the release of standard infectious LCMV (P = 0.27; Fig 6B) LCMV DI particle formation requires a functional ESCRT pathway. VSV requires a functional ESCRT pathway for infectious virus release. t-rex HEK293 cells stably transduced with vectors for tetracycline-based induction of DN VPS4B. T-Rex HEK293 cells stably transduced with vectors for tetracycline-based induction of WT or the DN VPS4B EQ were infected with rLCMV WT and 2 d later treated with tetracycline to induce the expression of WT or DN VPS4B. supernatants were collected 18 hr later (72 hr pi) and titered via plaque assay. the data in (D) are representative of the mean SEM relative to WT VSP4B (at 2,000 PFU per well) from 4 independent experiments. each virus-containing preparation was subjected to UV-irradiation to inactivate standard infectious LCMV particles while preserving DI particle activity. LCMV strain Armstrong 53b particles grown in vero E6 cells were purified via sucrose-banding. this analysis revealed a tyrosine phosphorylation site near the C-terminus of the LCMV Z protein. both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated peptides containing this residue were observed at a ratio of 1 to 11, respectively. rLCMV encodes tyrosine with a streptavidin binding peptide (SBP) tag. two days later, cells were either treated with hydrogen peroxide or not. a phosphotyrosine signal was clearly detectable from Z. LCMV is phosphorylated in rodent cells. hek293T cells were transfected with an empty vector or a plasmid encoding LCMV Z with a C-terminal streptavidin binding peptide (SBP) tag. this residue is part of LCMV\u2019s only late domain, PPPY. it is well conserved among most Old World arenavirus Z proteins. to investigate the role of this late domain in the context of authentic virus, we generated rLCMV encoding either phenylalanine or alanine at position 88. rLCMV Z-Y88E was significantly increased compared to the Z-Y88F and Z-Y88A viruses (0.67 vs 0.53 or 0.52 mm2; P 0.01; Fig 2D), indicating virus spread was partially restored in the phosphomimetic virus. each mutant virus eventually reached peak WT titers. the area of plaques from rLCMV WT or Z Y88 mutants was measured using Image J. Mean values were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test with Dunn\u2019s multiple comparisons test. plasmid-derived WT or Y88 mutants showed a defect in VLP formation due to its inability to be myristoylated at this glycine residue. hek293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding WT or Y88 mutants and 1 day later the VLP-containing supernatant. the budding activity of all three Z Y88 mutants was significantly reduced compared to WT Z. quantitative western blotting revealed substantial reductions in the total amount of NP, GP, and Z in the Y88 mutant particles relative to WT virus. however, no difference was observed in the levels of these proteins among the three Y88 mutant viruses. representative western blots for NP, GP2 and Z are shown in (A) data in (B-F) are representative of the mean SEM relative to rLCMV WT from at least 3 independent experiments. the number of DI particles per cell is lowered allowing standard virus to enter cells in the absence of DI particles and form plaques. the PPXY-mutant viruses exhibited a considerable increase in cytopathology (Fig 4A, 25,000 and 2,500 PFU) rLCMV WT or Y88 mutants were unable to isolate fractions containing pure DI particles as abundant levels of standard virus were detectable across all 15 fractions. however, it was not possible to identify a DI particle-specific signature for screening purposes. the rLCMV WT and Y88 mutant samples examined in Fig 4 showed substantial DI particle interfering activity. the mutant Y88 viruses had much less. a stock of rLCMV WT containing both standard infectious virus particles and DI particles was subjected to UV irradiation for 2 min to inactivate standard LCMV particles but spare DI particles. serial 5-fold dilutions of each UV-LCMV preparation (filtered or not) were added to vero E6 cells followed by a fixed amount of 50 PFU of the indicated challenge virus. the ability of these UV-LCMV preparations to interfere with the ability of standard LCMV to form plaques was measured via plaque assay and LCMV DI titers are reported as PIU50/mL. rLCMV WT or Y88 mutants examined in Fig 4 were subjected to the assay described in (A-B) to directly measure the DI particle titer present in each virus preparation. the ESCRT pathway can also affect LCMV entry. we infected cells with LCMV for 48 hr to allow the entire monolayer to become infected before inducing expression of WT or DN VPS4. the virus-containing media was collected 18 hr later (72 hr pi) LCMV LCMV produced significantly fewer DI particles per standard infectious virus particle in the DN VPS4B background compared to cells expressing WT or DN VPS4A (Fig 6C and 6D). LCMV LCMV produced significantly fewer DI particles per standard infectious virus particle compared to cells expressing WT or DN VPS4A (S3 Fig). cells were infected with VSV in media containing tetracycline. one hr later, the viral inoculum was removed and replaced with fresh media containing tetracycline. supernatants collected to determine VSV PFU titers via plaque assay. fixed at 72 hr pi to examine, via immunofluorescent microscopy, the expression and localization of WT or DN VPS4B (green) or LCMV NP (red) the results represent the mean LCMV PFU SEM from 4 independent experiments. the LCMV DI titers were reported as mean PIU50/mL SEM for 4 independent experiments. the ability of most arenavirus matrix proteins to drive viral budding is thought to be highly dependent upon one or more encoded late domains. the arenavirus LCMV encodes a single late domain, PPPY. disruption of the PPXY motif (PPXF or PPXA) or disruption of the ESCRT pathway causes decreased overall DI particle production compared to standard infectious particles. LCMV uses divergent pathways for the production of infectious and DI particles. pancy may reflect differences in the particular VLP assays employed. the different VLP systems could recapitulate different aspects of virus particle release. one VLP assay mimicking infectious virus production while the other more closely resembles DI formation. rLCMV PPXY mutants release much less NP, GP, and Z per PFU of cell-free virus. this is presumably due to reduced levels of DI particles being released by the PPXY mutant viruses. the degree of reduction was not equivalent among the viral proteins. the PPXY domain is particularly strong in driving DI particle assembly and release. it is possible that individual arenaviruses require different rates of DI particle formation for optimal fitness. the LCMV Z protein is phosphorylated, suggesting that phosphorylation may be important for the regulation of one or more of Z\u2019s functions. PPXY-containing viruses also require NEDD4 family E3 ubiquitin ligases (e.g., NEDD4, ITCH, or WWP1) that can directly bind to the PPXY motif via their WW domains. phosphorylation of the PPXY motif could regulate DI particle release. the ability of the PPXY late domain to drive the production of DI particles is a novel finding with important implications for understanding host-pathogen relationships. the ability of the PPXY late domain to drive the production of DI particles is a novel finding with important implications for understanding host-pathogen relationships.
