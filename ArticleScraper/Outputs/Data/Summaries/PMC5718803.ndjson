{"summary": "Advax4+ECMX immunization induced high vaccine-specific IgG2a and IgG1 levels and Th1 T cell response. around one third of the world population is infected with latent Mtb, of which 10% will develop active disease at some point in their life. Advax is an adjuvant derived from delta inulin, a polysaccharide found in the roots of plants of the Compositae family. it has shown high levels of efficacy in vaccines against respiratory syncytial virus, west Nile virus and Japanese encephalitis virus. it has also been shown to be safe and effective in pregnant mothers and newborns. adjuvant alone and combined with CMX protein was injected into the quadriceps muscle and the tissues collected after 2 days. there was no difference in the striated muscle tissue morphology in the saline group (Figure 1B) the mice inoculated only with rCMX (Figure 1C) or Advax4+CMX (Figure 1E) had a small increase in mononuclear cells. these results confirmed the lack of muscle damage in response to injection Advax4+CMX vaccine increases lymphatic endothelial cells and activated macrophages in the draining lymph nodes. the percentages of blood endothelial cells (BECs) were similar to the nodes from control mice. both Advax4+CMX and Advax4+ECMX vaccines are highly immunogenic. serum antibodies and the IgG2a/IgG1 ratio are a convenient marker to assess vaccine immunogenicity. all vaccines induced high antibody levels since 30 days after first vaccination. results shown are representative of two independent experiments (N = 6; *, # p 0.05). Advax4 formulated vaccines reduce lung inflammatory injury caused by Mtb Forty-five days post infection the normal lung alveolar architecture was extremely altered due to inflammation associated with Mtb infection. the presence of mononuclear cells at periarteriolar inflammatory areas could still be observed. the presence of mononuclear cells at periarteriolar inflammatory areas could still be observed. rCMX formulated with either CpG-DNA or Advax4 adjuvant did not reduce lung bacillary loads when compared to control unimmunized mice. the combination of ESAT-6 and CMX protein when formulated with Advax4 adjuvant reduced lung bacillary load. mice inoculated only with rCMX (Figure 1C) or Advax4+CMX (Figure 1E) had a small increase in mononuclear cells. results confirm lack of muscle damage in response to injection of Advax4 adjuvant. mice were immunized three times with 30 days intervals. Advax4+CMX vaccine increases lymphatic endothelial cells and activated macrophages in the draining lymph nodes. the percentages of blood endothelial cells (BECs) were similar to the nodes from control mice. mainly work via induction of T cell immunity, serum antibodies and the IgG2a/IgG1 ratio are a convenient marker to assess vaccine immunogenicity. sera from immunized mice were therefore analyzed to compare the immunogenicity of vaccine-specific IgG1 and IgG2a. Statistical difference between the analyzed group and the same group after the first vaccination. mice were challenged with Mtb (105 CFU per mice) and then euthanized after 45 days to evaluate the cellular response. the presence of mononuclear cells at periarteriolar inflammatory areas could still be observed. both vaccine formulations containing Advax4 exhibited significantly reduced Mtb-associated alveolar inflammatory damage. the presence of mononuclear cells at periarteriolar inflammatory areas could still be observed. rCMX formulated with either CpG-DNA or Advax4 adjuvant did not reduce lung bacillary loads when compared to control unimmunized mice. immunization with Advax4+ECMX significantly reduced lung bacillary load when compared to control unimmunized mice. rCMX antigen was expressed by a live M. smegmatis vector. a potent and protective response was induced against M. tuberculosis. the rCMX antigen even when formulated with Advax-4 was non-protective and stimulated poor T-cell responses. Advax delta inulin adjuvant alone or combined with either CpG or murabutide innate immune activators has been shown to be safe and effective in human subjects. if the vaccine antigen generates Th1 responses, delta inulin will potentiate the Th2 response. this is a property borne out in this study where Advax4 adjuvant was associated with a balanced IgG2a/IgG1 response. Advax4+ECMX vaccine was associated with the highest frequency of vaccine specific Th1 cells in the lungs post-challenge together with the best lung protection against alveolar damage. however, Advax4+ECMX vaccine did not induce measurable Th17 responses associated with protection. the lack of IL17 induction by Advax4 may explain reduced lung damage. the addition of ESAT-6 made a major difference in the protection provided by the recombinant protein vaccine. the rCMX protein was previously shown to be protective for mice in other vaccine formulations against Mtb. a challenge is to create an Mtb vaccine able to act at the start of infection with enough strength to overcome Mtb's ability to escape and survive within myeloid immune cells. an important next step for Advax4+ECMX vaccine development will be to further evaluate its effects on cellular immunity. animals were kept in animal-housing facilities at Instituto de Patologia Tropical e Sade Pblica. animals were kept in micro-isolators containing HEPA filters. room humidity controlled from 40 to 70% and light/dark cycles of 12 hours. rCMX and rECMX production Large-scale recombinant CMX (rCMX) or rECMX protein production was achieved by culturing E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS transformed with each recombinant plasmid separately in liquid LB medium. cultures were further incubated for additional 4\u20135 hours. Advax4+ECMX contained Advax4 (1mg delta inulin/injection); 2: CpG-DNA+CMX consisted of CpG-DNA (200 g/ml) (20 g/injection) with the rCMX fusion protein (200 g/ml) as controls, the adjuvant and the recombinant proteins were formulated alone at the same concentration used in the vaccine formulations. blood collection and indirect ELISA for rCMX and rECMX Blood from the caudal vein was obtained. samples were incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C, centrifuged at 800 x g and the serum obtained were frozen at 20\u00b0C. the indirect ELISA was performed as previously published with less modifications to optimize the reaction to rECMX. cells from each group were euthanized and homogenized. cells were then stimulated with ConA (10 g/mL), rCMX (10 g/mL) or rECMX (10 g/mL) non stimulated cells from all animals were used as control. lymphocytes were gated by size and granularity before fluorometric analysis. at least 50,000 lymphocytes were acquired per sample. apical lung lobe from each mouse was collected 45 days after infection. rCMX and rECMX construction de Sousa et al. (2012)6 described pET23a/CMX plasmid construction. resulting recombinant plasmid named pET23a/ECMX was confirmed by enzyme-restricted profiles as well as sequencing of the entire construction. rCMX protein has a molecular weight of 30 KDa and the rECMX protein has 36 KDa. a combination adjuvant contained delta inulin 1mg, oligonucleotide 10 g and murabutide 10 g per vaccine dose. experimental design Six groups of 6\u20137 adults (8-10 weeks old) female BALB/c were used in this study. animals from groups CpG-DNA+CMX, Advax4+CMX, rCMX alone, Advax4+ECMX, and rECMX alone were injected three times intramuscularly with each vaccine. the indirect ELISA was performed as previously published with less modifications to optimize the reaction to rECMX. 100 L of each serum sample were diluted to 1:200 (rCMX) or 1:800 (rECMX) in 1% skim milk in saline. cell phenotypes were acquired using a BD Biosciences leased to the Instituto de Patologia Tropical e Sade Pblica/Universidade Federal de Goi\u00e1s. lymphocytes in the spleen or lungs were gated by size and granularity before fluorometric analysis. load evaluation To evaluate bacillary load after vaccination, the apical lung lobe from each mouse was collected 45 days after infection. the data were digitalized using Microsoft Office Excel 2013 and GraphPad Prism version 6.0. the average and standard deviation were calculated for each experimental group."}
