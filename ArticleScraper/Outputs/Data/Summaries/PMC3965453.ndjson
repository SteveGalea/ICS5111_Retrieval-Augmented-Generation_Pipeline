{"summary": "the majority of orthoreoviruses are fusogenic, including avian, baboon, reptilian and Nelson Bay orthoreoviruses. the majority of orthoreoviruses are fusogenic, while the mammalian and piscine orthoreoviruses (MRV) are nonfusogenic. a throat swab sample was centrifuged for 10 min at 15000g at 4\u00b0C. the supernatant fractions were inoculated into the monolayers of the RD-18S, HEp-2, Vero, and CaCo-2 cell lines. a rapid determination system of viral genome detection (RDV) was developed by our group. the method is effective in the identification of unknown emerging viruses [10]\u2013[15]. avian orthoreovirus [16], mammalian orthoreovirus 1 [17], and mammalian orthoreovirus 3 [18] were used for evaluation of migration pattern of Miyazaki-Bali/2007-dsRNA segments in comparison with those of these viruses. Plaque assay for determination of infectious dose Infectious dose of Miyazaki-Bali/2007 was determined by a plaque assay using vero cell monolayers. the cell monolayers were inoculated with each of serially diluted virus solutions and incubated for 1 hr for adsorption. orthoreovirus nucleotide sequence data obtained in this study or from GenBank (Table 1) were phylogenetically analyzed using MEGA5.2 (PMID: 21546353) the nucleotide sequences of the open reading frames (ORFs) for sigma C protein (S1-segment), major inner capsid protein (S2-segment), sigma NS protein (S3-segment), or major outer capsid protein AB521793 (550\u20131545) AB521794* (1\u20131241) AB521795 (4\u20131107) AB521796* (9\u20131094) Mammalian 1 strain Lang L19774 (19\u20131275) M13139 (33\u20131104) Mammalian 2 strain D5/Jones M10261 (14\u20131213) L19775 (19\u20131275) X60066 (33\u20131104) Mammalian 3 strain Dearing HM159619 (13\u2013 serum samples were collected from 46 people who may have had contact with the patient. they were subjected to neutralization antibody assay as described above. information on symptoms after possible contact with the patient was collected. human rights of the patient were protected as much as possible. serum samples collected from contact persons with the index patient were also collected only for detection of the neutralization antibody to the orthoreovirus isolated, Miyazaki-Bali/2007. the RDV method uses whole-genome amplification and nucleotide sequencing techniques. the method is effective in the identification of unknown emerging viruses [10]\u2013[15]. the supernatant fraction containing dsRNA was treated with ethanol precipitation. precipitated dsRNA was solubilized with water and separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Genome segments were visualized by ethidium bromide staining. d protein, nonstructural replication (NS) protein, and major outer capsid protein were amplified by RT-PCR. the nucleotide sequence of the genomes amplified was determined using the direct sequencing method. orthoreovirus nucleotide sequence data obtained in this study or from GenBank were phylogenetically analyzed using MEGA5.2. mammalian 1 strain Lang L19774 (19\u20131275) M13139 (33\u20131104) Mammalian 2 strain D5/Jones M10261 (14\u20131213) L19775 (19\u20131275) HM159621 (28\u20131128) K02739 (33\u20131112) Mammalian 4 strain Dearing HM159619 (13\u20131380) L19776 (19\u20131275) HM159621 (28\u20131128) K02739 (33\u2013 HK50842/10 JF803295 (529\u20131501) JF803297 (1\u20131178) JF803299 (1\u20131046) JF803301 (9\u20131078) Kampar EU448334 (527\u20131567) EU448335 (16\u20131266) EU448336 (29\u20131132) EU44833 (30\u20131115) Melaka EF026043 (584\u20131570) EF026044 (16\u20131266) EF026046 (30\u20131115) Nelson Bay ethical statement Serum samples collected from the patient were obtained only for etiological analyses. travel history, clinical and laboratory data of the patient were also disclosed under the written informed consent. human rights of the patient were protected as much as possible. no abnormalities were observed in serum electrolyte concentrations. at 2.66 mg/dl, the patient's C-reactive protein was elevated. on November 29, eight days after admission, all of the patient's symptoms resolved. comparison of genome segments of the CPE agent by gel electrophoresis revealed an electropherotype that was almost identical to previously reported electropherotypes of Melaka and Pulau orthoreoviruseses. icosahedral particles resembling those of the family Reoviridae, genus Orthoreovirus rose significantly against the isolated virus. homology was evaluated using nucleotide sequences of S3-segment. homology of miyazaki-Bali/2007 S4-segment was 94% to those of HK23629/03, HK46886/09, and HK50842/10 and less than those of other orthoreoviruses. homology was almost the same as that observed in S2-segment. 36.2 23.7 HK23629/07 54.9 58.0 57.8 56.3 63.9 45.4 63.1 64.9 47.4 35.4 21.7 HK46886/09 97.8 56.1 99.5 99.5 91.7 54.7 46.0 56.2 55.1 46.5 35.1 23.3 HK50842/10 97.2 55.5 99.3 91.5 54.7 46.1 56.2 55.1 46.6 35.1 23.3 Kampar 93.6 55.2 91.5 90.9 56.1 48.2 Miyazaki-Bali/2007 formed a subcluster with HK23629/07, but not with HK46886/09 and HK50842/10. all the 4 viruses including Miyazaki-BaliHK23629/07, HK46886/09, and HK50842/10 originated from Indonesia. a small lymph node in the patient's right neck was palpable with mild tenderness. the patient's white blood cell, red blood cell, hemoglobin, and platelet counts were within normal ranges. RT-PCR was performed against the isolated virus with primer sets designed specifically for the amplification of the S4 segments of HK23629/07. icosahedral particles resembling those of the family Reoviridae, genus Orthoreovirus possessed a mean diameter of approximately 75 nm. the homology of Miyazaki-Bali/2007 was 97% to those of HK46886/09 and HK50842/10. the homology pattern was almost identical to that observed in S2-segment. the homology pattern was almost identical to that observed in S2-segment. sigma NS protein (S3-segment) and major outer capsid protein (S4-segment) between the orthoviruses of Nelson Bay group as well as avian, baboon and mammalian orthoreoviruses. sigma NS protein (S3-segment) and major outer capsid protein (S4-segment) between the orthoviruses of the Nelson Bay group. i river 41.9 39.5 40.4 40.7 41.0 44.2 57.8 38.7 43.3 38.1 24.1 Avian_strain_138 23.6 23.0 22.7 22.7 23.0 23.5 23.9 25.3 24.4 23.9 23.2 Mammalian_2_strain_D5/Jones 12.6 11.7 12.2 12.0 12.8 11.7 10.0 11.2 11.6 10.2 10.4 Phylogenetic analyses Miyazaki-Bali/2007 formed NS protein (C), and major outer capsid protein (D) listed in Table 1. sporadic outbreaks belong to the species of Nelson Bay orthoreovirus isolated from humans with RTI. a patient infected with an orthoreovirus classified to the species of Nelson Bay orthoreovirus was infected. three patients were infected in Malaysia, and the other 4 were imported to Hong Kong. both the present and 2 of the Hong Kong cases were infected with their respective viruses in Bali. the association pattern was different from those based on the S1- and S3-segments' sequences. the cause behind this difference might be the reassortment event among these orthoreoviruses in the endemic regions. orthoreoviruses isolated from patients with RTI were classified to the species of Nelson Bay orthoreovirus. there is no direct evidence of bat origin in the reported cases. however, epidemiological studies that were performed in each of the reports indicated the potential for bat exposure before the onset of the disease. the virus genome of ebolavirus, another genus of family Filoviridae, was detected in serum samples from three species of fruit bats. this suggests that fruit bats may serve as a viral reservoir for ebolavirus. the authors described an imported case of an RTI associated with an orthoreovirus."}
