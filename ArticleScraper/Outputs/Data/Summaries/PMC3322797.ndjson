{"summary": "the index case, patient A, was admitted to TTSH, a 1,400-bed hospital, on march 1, 2003 for atypical pneumonia. she was treated in a six-bed ward until she was isolated on march 6. a second superspreading event occurred when one of the nurses infected by patient AA, patient AA, was admitted to an open ward (8A) on march 10. TTSH was aware of five healthcare workers who were on medical leave for fever, four of whom were from ward 5A and one from ward 8A. asymptomatic contacts were isolated while asymptomatic contacts were advised to seek medical attention if they became ill. by march 21, approximately 30 probable SARS cases had been reported. the decision was made to close TTSH\u2019s normal operations on march 22. all healthcare workers in the hospital adopted the use of N95 masks, gowns, and gloves at all times. a strict regimen (3x/day) of temperature surveillance of all staff was also instituted on march 21. if all discharges from affected areas in TTSH had been stopped on March 15, the 60 probable SARS cases in SGH linked to patient B might have been prevented. if a no-visitor policy had been implemented in TTSH on March 15, at least 17 new SARS cases outside of TTSH could theoretically have been prevented. the public health response was based on two key considerations: first, with 1,600 beds, SGH is the largest acute hospital in Singapore. all SARS cases came from wards 57 and 58. no affected healthcare workers came to work when they had fever. outcome Containment measures controlled intrahospital infection spread within 10 days. of exposed patients and healthcare workers transferred to TTSH, probable SARS developed in eight. all were infected before the transfer. two exposed clinical areas were missed in the initial containment strategy. ward 64 remained isolated until the morning of April 9 when he was transferred to TTSH. probable SARS was diagnosed after a complete history of contact was elicited. the key containment strategy was isolating exposed persons. a second superspreading event occurred when one of the nurses infected by patient A, patient AA, was admitted to an open ward (8A) on march 10. 25 people (12 healthcare workers, four patients in the same ward, eight visitors, and one household contact) had been infected. staff found to have a temperature >37.5\u00b0C were given medical leave for 3 days with a review on the third day. probable SARS was diagnosed in a total of 13 people, all of whom were admitted to TTSH. asymptomatic contacts were isolated while asymptomatic contacts were advised to seek medical attention if they became ill. a strict regimen (3x/day) of temperature surveillance of all staff was also instituted on March 21. the hospital limited visitors; visits to SARS case-patients were initially permitted, but visitors were required to use personal protective equipment. non-SARS patients were discharged if they had no known exposure to SARS. if no-visitor policy had been implemented in TTSH on March 15, at least 17 new SARS cases outside of TTSH could theoretically have been prevented. the index case-patient in SGH was patient B, who did not exhibit typical signs and symptoms of SARS. workers were March 31 for one case-patient, April 2 for three case-patients, April 3 for four case-patients, and April 4 for five case-patients. the key containment strategy in the SGH was to completely remove exposed patients and healthcare workers to TTSH, the designated SARS hospital. the first group identified was the 80 patients in wards 57 and 58 during the \u201chot\u201d period. 11 additional cases were detected in two new areas in the diagnostic radiology department and a tertiary cancer facility. patient B had been in the diagnostic radiology department on April 1, where two healthcare assistants, two outpatients, and one visitor were infected. fortunately, the cases were detected early because of SGH\u2019s strict 3x/day temperature monitoring regimen for all staff. the last probable SARS case from this ward was detected on April 25. the last probable SARS case from this ward was detected on April 11, by which time two family contacts had been infected. if an outbreak is recognized early, can the likely source of the infection cluster be rapidly identified\" the most prudent course in our view is to close the hospital and place all healthcare workers on work quarantine as an immediate measure. if the outbreak is detected late, the most prudent course in our view is to close the hospital and place all healthcare workers on work quarantine as an immediate measure. a small cluster of 10 secondary cases arose as a result of failing to identify exposed healthcare workers and patient contacts. the contact history for both patients B and C was not thoroughly obtained at admission, but they were not isolated. temperatures were checked by designated staff and recorded in other hospitals. no-visitor policy in all public hospitals was implemented 2 weeks after detecting the NUH outbreak. key difficulties in containing the TTSH outbreak were: late recognition of disease, 2) lack of understanding of the disease, 3) inadequate infrastructure to support outbreak management of this scale, 5) lack of understanding of superspreading events. fever surveillance among healthcare workers quickly identified potentially infected healthcare workers in hospitals with SARS outbreaks. in the NUH outbreak, temperature surveillance identified two ward 64 nurses who were isolated the same day. at least 21 cases resulted from spread by hospital visitors to family and community contacts. the second component was detecting possible SARS clusters early. the third component was ensuring all hospitals have established and tested systems to rapidly generate a complete list of potential healthcare workers, patients, and visitor contacts."}
