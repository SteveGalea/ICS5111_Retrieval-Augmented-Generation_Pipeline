{"summary": "the ever-increasing incidence of chronic viral infections caused by HIV and hepatitis B and C viruses continues to increase the global burden of infectious diseases. there are enormous challenges to the development of these vaccines, especially since millions of people are already chronically infected with these viruses. advent of cell-penetrating Peptides Traditional antiviral therapy has relied on small molecules such as protease inhibitors or nucleotide analogues to inhibit viral enzymes. however, due to their physical properties, the cellular uptake of these molecules is strongly restricted. the inability of these molecules to cross the cell membrane to reach their intracellular target precludes further clinical application. the exact mechanism of cellular uptake is not clear and studies remain controversial. current models include uptake through transient pore formation, caveolae, clathrin-dependent endocytosis, and macropinocytosis. an heptamer arginine-conjugated cyclosporine A (Psorban) has entered phase II of a clinical trial for topical treatment of psoriasis. the oligoarginine peptide allows the penetration of cyclosporine A into cells throughout the otherwise impermeable epidermis and dermis. treatment given after MHV challenge PPMO with higher number of arginine residues exhibit greater antiviral activity in cell culture PPMO with insertion of 6-aminohexanoic acid offer greater protection in mouse Equine arteritis virus. [80] (RXR)4XB Cell culture Influenza A virus [81,82,83] (RXR)4XB Cell culture Higher doses of PPMO induced abnormal infiltration of mouse lungs by immune system cells R5F2R4C Mouse DNA viruses Kaposi \u2019s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus [84,85] R5F2R4C Cell culture (RXR)4XB Herpesvirus type 1 (RXR) phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs) are antisense DNA oligonucleotide analogues. their backbone is composed of morpholine rings joined by uncharged phosphodiamidate linkages. they act through steric blockage of the complementary RNA sequences. proCasp3 stands for pro-caspase 3; RT stands for reverse transcription; Tn stands for transportan. investigators have been arming them with CPPs to promote their uptake into virus-infected cells. PPMOs are particularly well-suited cargoes for CPPs as their uncharged components do not interact with the positively-charged carrier peptide. arginine-rich peptides with insertions of 6-aminohexanoic acid stood out for their in vivo effectiveness. the higher the number of arginine-6-aminohexanoic repeats, the higher were PMO antiviral effect on MHV in cell culture [63] and protection against EBOV infection in mice [64]. PPMOs were shown to suppress viral replication, attenuate symptoms of disease in and/or increase survivorship of mice infected with WNV [67], DENV [70], MHV [63], PV1 [75], CVB3 [76], EBOV [64,78], RSV [79], and FLUAV [82,83]. some PPMOs demonstrated very profound and impressive antiviral effects. mice treated with 200-g doses of a (RXR)4XB-conjugated PPMO survived lethal infection. VEEV was undetectable in PPMO-treated mice brain, blood and peripheral tissues. PPMOs are being routinely tested against RNA viruses. PPMOs were covalently conjugated at their 5\u2019 to (RXR)4XB or R5F2R4C. PPMO treatment inhibited vIL-6 expression, which in turn reduced human IL-6 level and KSHV yield, and reduced growth of treated cells. PPMOs exhibited antisense activity 3- to 25-fold higher than corresponding PMOs while bearing lower off-target effects. authors propose that the arginine-rich peptides enhance RNA-PMO binding affinity thereby increasing specific antisense activity. PPMO vs. PMO in vivo Antiviral Efficacy There have been a few reports of PMO-mediated antiviral activity in animal models. studies have been done that directly compared PMO and PPMO antiviral activity in vivo. eptide-nucleic acids or PNAs are oligonucleotide analogues in which the sugar-phosphate backbone has been replaced with peptide bonds. they are resistant to both nucleases and proteases. they are used as antisense molecules to specifically bind to their complementary DNA or RNA sequences. tat and penetratin conjugates failed to inhibit transcription. none of the conjugates carrying the stable polyether linker could elicit trans-activation inhibition. authors argue endosomal release is a limiting factor in conjugates efficiency. all PNAs were conjugated to tat via an O-linker to promote efficient cellular uptake. tat-PNA conjugates successfully inhibited JEV proliferation in cell culture. only few in vivo studies have been reported with CPP-PNA conjugates. 125I-labeled PNATAR and its penetratin and tat conjugates showed a similar tissue distribution and clearance profile. unconjugated naked PNATAR displayed a similar tissue distribution and clearance profile. in vivo antiviral activity of PNATAR and its penetratin and tat conjugates must be assessed. the authors developed a novel method for systemic delivery of antiviral siRNAs into T cells in mice. they used an antibody to the CD7 receptor as their delivery system by receptor-mediated endocytosis. they successfully suppressed HIV-1 infection in a humanized mouse model using a cocktail of these siRNA complexes. antiviral agents can target retroviruses, as shown for HIV, non-retroviral RNA viruses, and DNA viruses, as shown for HSV. interference with viral RNA processing and translation further inhibits viral replication. CPP conjugates can also be designed to target virus-infected cells. nature of Peptides Conjugated to PMOs Peptide-mediated PMO delivery has been the focus of intense efforts to identify active, stable, non toxic and endosomolytic CPPs. arginine-rich peptides with insertions of 6-aminohexanoic acid stood out for their in vivo effectiveness. PPMOs against RNA Viruses PPMO antiviral activity has mainly been exploited against a wide range of non-retroviral RNA viruses. cell culture assays consistently showed that PPMO readily entered infected cells and could specifically and strongly inhibit viral replication. PPMOs were shown to suppress viral replication, attenuate symptoms of disease in and/or increase survivorship of mice infected with WNV [67], DENV [70], MHV [63], PV1 [75], CVB3 [76], VEEV [77], EBOV [64,78], RSV [79], and FLUAV [82,83]. PPMOs are being routinely tested against RNA viruses. fluorescein (Fl)-labeled PMOs entered cells poorly. PPMOs were efficiently taken up by BCBL-1 lymphocytes. PPMOs could effectively inhibit RTA and LANA protein expression in cell culture. the investigators applied 100 g ICP0 PPMO daily to the eyes of uninfected mice. no gross or microscopic eye damage, no effect on body weight and temperature were observed following the seven-day treatment. the results strengthen the potential of PPMOs as a treatment for recurring corneal disease from HSV-1 reactivation. mice treated with high doses of PPMO would suffer from weight loss and develop abnormal behavior and smaller livers. authors hypothesize that the arginine-rich CPP mimics the eosinophil major basic protein in triggering the migration of inflammatory cells. PPMOs increased survival of DENV-infected mice up to eight days. PPMOs could not protect mice against WNV infection while PPMOs did not provide any survival benefit. PPMOs against RNA Viruses PPMO antiviral activity has been exploited against a wide range of non-retroviral RNA viruses. PPMOs against RNA Viruses PPMO antiviral activity has been exploited against a wide range of non-retroviral RNA viruses. fluorescein-labeled PPMOs accumulated in the nucleus but were present throughout the cells. many investigators identified potent PPMO activity in cell culture assays and went on to test their antiviral properties in murine experimental models. some PPMOs demonstrated very profound antiviral effects. PPMOs could effectively inhibit RTA and LANA protein expression in cell culture. treatment of KSHV-infected cells with RTA PPMO suppressed KSHV replication. PPMO treatment inhibited expression of vIL-6 with PPMOs. the most potent PPMOs designed against ICP0 or ICP27 strongly inhibited HSV-1 replication in cell culture by reducing viral protein expression. the authors also tested ICP0 PPMO in a mouse model of ocular herpes infection. PPMO Toxicity PPMOs appear to be generally well tolerated by cultured cells and animal recipients. however, some studies reported toxicity in cell culture with increase of PPMO dose [66] or longer period of exposure. in vivo toxicity as the treatment dose increased, usually at doses higher than antiviral ones. studies have been done that directly compared PMO and PPMO antiviral activity in vivo. PPMOs offered 100% protection against EBOV infection at 5-g and 50-g doses. PPMOs increased survival of deNV-infected mice up to eight days. groups have been working on antivirals targeting highly-conserved regulatory regions of the HIV-1 genome critical for its replication and gene expression. the authors designed PNAs directed against these regions to inhibit HIV-1 gene expression and replication. the poor cellular uptake of these uncharged compounds led Pandey and co-workers to covalently conjugate PNA at its 5' end to various cell-penetrating peptides. tat and penetratin conjugates failed to inhibit transcription. none of the conjugates carrying the stable polyether linker could elicit trans-activation inhibition. authors argued endosomal release is a limiting factor in conjugates efficiency. only few in vivo studies have been reported with CPP-PNA conjugates. toxicity, immunological and pharmacokinetic studies have been carried out in mice. mice were given 100 mg/kg of the conjugate at repeat doses ranging from 100 mg/kg. the extent of its uptake was lower than its CPP conjugate. in vivo antiviral activity of PNATAR and its penetratin and tat conjugates needs to be assessed. authors designed PNAs directed against these regions to inhibit HIV-1 gene expression and replication. tat and penetratin conjugates failed to inhibit trans-activation. none of the conjugates carrying the stable polyether linker could elicit trans-activation inhibition. tat and penetratin conjugates failed to inhibit transcription. all PNAs were conjugated to tat via an O-linker to promote efficient cellular uptake. tat-PNA conjugates crossed the plasma membrane but also penetrated into the convoluted membrane system to interfere with viral replication. only few in vivo studies have been reported with CPP-PNA conjugates. unconjugated naked PNATAR displayed a similar tissue distribution and clearance profile. the extent of its uptake was lower than its CPP conjugate. in vivo antiviral activity of PNATAR and its penetratin and tat conjugates needs to be assessed. authors developed a novel method for systemic delivery of antiviral siRNAs into mice. they used an antibody to the CD7 receptor as their delivery system by receptor-mediated endocytosis. they successfully suppressed HIV-1 infection in a humanized mouse model using a cocktail of these siRNA complexes. p27SJ, a protein from the St John\u2019s wort, has been put forward as a potential anti-HIV-1 molecule by Darbinian et al. recently, the investigators have used the tat peptide as part of a bi-directional protein transduction system. the antiviral protein of interest was expressed with tat at its C-terminal. a tat peptide containing a cysteine residue at its C-terminal (tat-C) was shown to inhibit infection in three ways. tat-C appears to act by inhibiting viral entry at the fusion step rather than at the virus attachment step. the conjugates may have been able to enter the virion particles and bind to the TAR region of the viral RNA. the PNA-CPP may also have altered or disrupted the viral envelope through the interaction of the CPP moiety with the viral lipid bilayer, thereby inhibiting host cell infection. however, their work set the stage for exploring anti-HIV-1 activity displayed by CPPs on their own. CPP-antiviral agents have great promise as novel preventive and therapeutic modalities against viral infections. they also show promise in inhibiting the reactivation from latent infections of viruses such as HSV-1. this is particularly true for PPMO research where much effort has been put towards developing highly active peptides. a disulphide bond would result in the rapid release of the cargo through the action of cytoplasm glutathione. research on antiviral CPP-PNA, -siRNA and -protein conjugates is still at its infancy and importantly needs validation in animal models. ense molecules targeting multiple sequences in the viral genome should have a greater antiviral effect compared to a treatment with a single antisense molecule. a number of CPPs are derived from viral proteins, such as tat, VP22, and FHV."}
