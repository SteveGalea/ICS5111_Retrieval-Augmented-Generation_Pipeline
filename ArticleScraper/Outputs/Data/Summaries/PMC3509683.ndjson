{"summary": "human coronaviruses 229E and OC43 (HCoV 229E and OC43) were previously known to be responsible for mild and upper respiratory tract diseases. since then, two further members of this family have been identified (HCoV HUK1 and NL63) and HCoVs have been involved in more serious respiratory tract infections. coronavirus infections occur mainly in winter, with a short incubation time. they are recovered in 3 to 11% of patients sampled with a respiratory tract infection. they have since been implicated in more serious diseases of the lower respiratory tract as bronchitis, bronchiolitis or pneumonia. HCoV OC43 antibodies in children with gastroenteritis support this idea. this is supported by a body of evidence, e.g. neurological symptoms in some HCoV OC43 infected patients [29], experimental infection of neural cells with HCoV 229E and OC43 [41,42,43], detection of HCoV 229E and OC43 RNAs and antigens in brain of multiple sclerosis patients [44,45,46], or in one-third of the infected patients, the clinical symptoms regress. in the remaining two-thirds of the infected patients, the disease progresses to an atypical pneumonia. respiratory failure is the most common cause of death among those infected with SARS-CoV. studies have been conducted to identify potent anti-SARS-CoV treatment. standard molecules used in viral infections such as ribavirine, interferon or hydrocortisone were used, leading to diverging, and not so conclusive, results as they were tested in vivo or in vitro. the HCoV 229E and the HCoV OC43, now called betacoronavirus 1 [1], were the first human coronaviruses to be identified. since the late sixties, they were recognized as being responsible for upper and mild respiratory tract infections such as the common cold [2,3,4,5,6] new studies have been conducted on the clinical features of HCoVs infections. these infections concern predominantly weak patients such as newborns or infants [23,24,26,30,32,33], elderly people [34,35] or immunosuppressed patients [23,36,37]. they have also been implicated in nosocomial infections notably in neonatal care unit [32,33]. despite these arguments, their implication in human intestinal infections is still controversial. oV 229E and HCoV OC43 were the first human coronaviruses to be identified. since the late sixties, they were recognized as responsible for upper and mild respiratory tract infections such as the common cold [2,3,4,5,6]. new studies have been conducted on the clinical features of HCoVs infections. implication of HCoVs in other human diseases is still controversial, but should be considered to evaluate the potential routes of HCoVs spread. this is supported by a body of evidence, e.g. neurological symptoms in some HCoV OC43 patients [29], experimental infection of neural cells with HCoV 229E and OC43. from November 2002 to July 2003, SARS-CoV affected more than 8000 people in all five continents and caused about 800 deaths. mortality rate was higher than 50% in aged (>60-year-old) populations. coronaviruses may have evolved from the bovine coronavirus OC43. this is suspected for the HCoV OC43 that may have evolved from the bovine coronavirus. a zoonotic virus that crossed the species barrier was amplified in palm civets. a similar immunopathologic reaction has been described in mice vaccinated with a SARS-CoV vaccine and subsequently challenged with SARS-CoV [97,98,99,100,101] safety concerns related to effectiveness and safety for vaccinated persons, especially if exposed to other coronaviruses, should be carefully examined. a study compared the survival rates of the HCoV 229E to the ones of a non-enveloped virus, the type 1-poliovirus, under different conditions of temperature and humidity. results are reported in Table 1. Table 1. Survival rates of the HCoV 229E and the poliovirus, type 1, under different conditions of temperature and humidity. the exposure of the virus to a temperature of 56 \u00b0C over 30 min reduced virus titer under an undetectable level. in this case, the temperature needs to reach 60 \u00b0C over 30 min to bring virus titer below the detection limit. this emphasizes the importance of organic material in which viruses could be embedded in the real conditions. HCoV OC43 was more sensitive to desiccation, since its infectivity was below the detectable threshold after three hrs of drying. the HCoV 229E and the HSV-1 were stable over nine days, with and without proteins. the adenovirus was the most stable virus assayed as it conserved its infectivity throughout the nine days of the experiment. a more recent study implicated water and sewage in the transmission of SARS-CoV. the time required for 99% reduction in water was 22 days for TGEV and 17 days for MHV. in sewage, it took nine days for TGEV and seven days for MHV. after four weeks in almost the same conditions, there was less than 1 log10 infectivity decrease for both viruses. sputum, serum and feces were shown to survive at least 96 hrs. infectivity level is still lower when it is suspended in urines. the same study revealed a SARS-CoV survival until four to five days. 15 min 24 h 15 min 24 h 30% 87% 65% >50% n.d. 91% 65% 0% 0% n.d. n.d. 50% 90.9% 75% >50% 20% 96.5% 80% 0% 0% n.d. 104.8% 86% 90% 30% n.d. n.d. at 4 \u00b0C, there was no loss of infectivity after 90, 60 and 30 min exposure at 56 \u00b0C, 67 \u00b0C and 75 \u00b0C, respectively. HCoV 229E and OC43 displayed survival rates of 80% and 100%, respectively, in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) over three days and 30% and 55%, respectively, over six days. the adenovirus was the most stable virus assayed. it retained its infectivity for as long as six days, with a further protecting effect of proteins. the adenovirus was the most stable virus assayed. studies have shown the potency of coronaviruses and especially the SARS-CoV. it was shown to survive at least 96 hrs in sputum, serum and feces. it could survive longer, up to four days, in diarrheic feces. the same study revealed a survival until four to five days in respiratory specimen. contamination of inanimate materials or other people seems to play a role in SARS-CoV transmission. the absence of treatment, the high mortality rate and the transmission patterns of SARS-CoV involved the setting of powerful and coordinated means of prevention. essentially, antiseptic-disinfectant antiviral activity is evaluated by combining viruses and the product to be tested for an appropriately defined and precise contact time. product activity and eventual cytotoxicity are then neutralized and the loss of viral infectivity due to the product activity is estimated. these tests require appropriate controls, especially to check the absence of interference on viral infectivity, due to the test itself. chemical neutralization associates dilution and chemical inactivation of the tested product and its cytotoxicity. but few neutralizers are available, especially when taking into account the huge number of antiseptics-disinfectants. this method may lengthen the contact time and lead to an overestimation of the product\u2019s activity. to date, only one European standard on virucidal antiseptic-disinfectant activity testing has been published. this protocol specifies the test method and the minimum requirements to establish virucidal activity according to the potential use of the products tested. a product is considered to have an antiseptic-disinfectant antiviral activity if it induces a loss of infectivity of at least 4 log10 in viral titers during an accurate contact time. two non-enveloped viruses (type b-coxsackievirus and type 5-adenovirus) and two enveloped viruses (HCoV 229E and type 3-parainfluenzavirus) with this aim, viral inocula were suspended in feces or mucin to mimic organic matter and left to dry on stainless-steel disks. n-alkyl-dimethylbenzyl chloride 0.04 (6.0) Yes Yes Yes + HCl 7.00 n-alkyl-dimethylbenzyl chloride 0.04 (1.0) Yes Yes Yes + sodium metasilicate 0.5 Chlorhexidine gluconate 0.008 (5.0) Yes Yes No No + cetrimide 0.08 Chlorhexidine gluconate 0.05 (4.5) Yes Yes No + cetrimide 0.50 + ethanol 70.0 the association chlorhexidine and cetrimide did not seem to be effective on HCoV 229E, except if ethanol is added. a more recent study investigated the action of antiseptics-disinfectants on HCoVs 229E and OC43 with suspension tests and contact times of 5 min. the neutralization step was achieved by dilution in medium culture. antiseptic antiviral activities were assayed thanks to suspension tests. the efficacy criterion was a reduction of 4 log10, as recommended by the european standard. a novel method of gel filtration for the neutralization step was developed in these studies. antiseptic HCoV 229E activity of (a) chlorhexidine (CHX) and (b) the 1,3-bis(bithiazolyl)-tetra-para-sulfonato-calix[4]arene (C[4]S-BTZ) was assessed using suspension tests with different organic loads. most of the tested alcoholic-based solutions (isopropanol or ethanol) has been shown to allow a reduction > 4 the results are recorded in Table 3. Virucidal activity on MHV and TGEV of different hand-rub formulations and surfaces disinfectants thanks to suspension tests. a study used MHV and TGEV as SARS-CoV surrogates. study found higher reductions of HCoV 229E viral titers with concentrations of hypochlorite greater than the one tested here. the results are consistent with a concentration-dependent effect. the absence of treatment, the high mortality rate and the transmission patterns of SARS-CoV involved the setting of powerful and coordinated means of prevention to stop the spread of this virus. the WHO expressed recommendations for travelers coming from areas affected by the SARS with screening of potential cases followed by aircraft disinfection [121]. a germicide can be considered to have an efficient antiseptic-disinfectant antiviral activity if it induces, in a well-defined contact time, a reduction in viral titers higher than 3 or 4 log10. it requires viruses with very high titers to observe a reduction in viral titers afterwards, making impossible the titration of the virus. this method may lengthen the contact time and lead to an overestimation of the product\u2019s activity. a precise contact time is fundamental to respect future use conditions and to reflect the real activity of the product in the field. chemical neutralization associates dilution and chemical inactivation of the tested product and its cytotoxicity. however, few neutralizers are available, especially when taking into account the huge number of antiseptics-disinfectants. this method may lengthen the contact time and lead to an overestimation of the product\u2019s activity. a precise contact time is fundamental to respect future use conditions and to reflect the real activity of the product in the field. only one european standard on virucidal antiseptic-disinfectant activity has been published. a product is considered to have an antiseptic-disinfectant antiviral activity if it induces a loss of infectivity of at least 4 log10 in viral titers during an accurate contact time. in the united states, the principal standard is relatively close to the European one but it specifies an efficacy criterion of 3 log10. viruses (type b-coxsackievirus and type 5-adenovirus) and two enveloped viruses (HCoV 229E and type 3-parainfluenzavirus) were suspended in feces or mucin to mimic organic matter. the contact time was 1 min and the efficacy criterion was a reduction in viral titers of 3 log10. n-alkyl-dimethylbenzyl chloride 0.04 (6.0) Yes Yes Yes + HCl 7.00 n-alkyl-dimethylbenzyl chloride 0.04 (1.0) Yes Yes Yes + ethanol 70.0 n-alkyl-dimethylbenzyl chloride 0.04 (1.0) Yes Yes Yes + sodium metasilicate 0.5 Chlorhexidine gluconate 0.008 (5.0) Yes Yes Yes + cetrimide 0.08 Ch the association chlorhexidine and cetrimide did not seem to be effective on HCoV 229E, except if ethanol is added. the neutralization step was achieved by dilution in medium culture. the povidone-iodine (0.75% free iodine) caused a 50% reduction in infectivity of both of the viruses. chlorhexidine was shown to have a time and concentration-dependent anti-HCoV 229E activity allowing a 3 log10 reduction. it was then not sufficient to claim an antiseptic anti-HCoV 229E activity. hexamidine did not show any activity against HCoV 229E [130,131] antiseptic HCoV 229E activity of chlorhexidine (CHX) and 1,3-bis(bithiazolyl)-tetra-para-sulfonato-calix[4]arene (C[4]S-BTZ) was evaluated using suspension tests with different organic loads. most of the tested alcoholic-based solutions (isopropanol or ethanol) has been shown to allow a reduction > 4 log10 in viral tit the results are recorded in Table 3. Virucidal activity on MHV and TGEV of different hand-rub formulations and surfaces disinfectants thanks to suspension tests. a study used MHV and TGEV as SARS-CoV surrogates. o-phenylphenol, 7.66% p-tertiary amylphenol, 7.66% p-tertiary amylphenol, 7.66% p-tertiary amylphenol, 0.55% ortho-phthalaldehyde, 71% ethanol, 71% ethanol, 71% ethanol, 71% ethanol, 71% ethanol, 71% ethanol, 71% ethanol, 71% ethanol, 71% ethanol, 71% septics-disinfectants activity evaluation should be developed in-field tests. we should also develop in-field tests in order to have a better appreciation of the true action of antiseptics-disinfectants.

[4]arene (C[4]S-BTZ) showed an equivalent, and even better, activity than that of chlorhexidine. activity reached almost 3 log10 reduction in viral titers from 5 min of contact time. the same team pursued its investigation evaluating the SARS-CoV virucidal activity of different disinfectants based on alcohols (propanol, ethanol used for hands disinfection), aldehydes (formaldehyde, glutardialdehyde), glucoprotamin and wine vinegar. the method was the same that previously described, except for the organic load, which was FCS. MHV TGEV Bleach (6% sodium hypochlorite \u2013 use dilution: 1:100, 600 mg/mL) no no 9.09% o-phenylphenol, 7.66% p-tertiary amylphenol No No 0.55% ortho-phthalaldehyde No No No 70% ethanol Yes Yes 62% ethanol No Yes 71% ethanol No Yes This study revealed first that there were behavioral differences between the two chosen as surrogates. s, containing either 0.05% of triclosan, 0.12% of chloroxylenol, 0.21% of sodium hypochlorite, 0.23% of pine oil, or 0.10% of a quaternary compound with 79.0% of ethanol, were investigated. all of them provided at least a 3 log10 reduction in viral titers within a 30 sec contact time, which is consistent with the previous results. only few formulations are efficient within an adapted contact time and without a too-strong toxicity. some largely used antiseptics-disinfectants such as ethanol or bleach show a significant activity on the HCoVs. however, some critical parameters should be considered, especially in case of chlorine-derived compounds."}
