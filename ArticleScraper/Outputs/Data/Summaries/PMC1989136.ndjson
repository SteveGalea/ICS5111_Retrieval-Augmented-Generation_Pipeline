{"summary": "HRV infections cause a wide spectrum of clinical outcomes ranging from asymptomatic infection to severe lower respiratory symptoms. traditional serology requires viral culture and neutralization tests using 101 serotype-specific antisera. the first HRV was discovered in 1956 [2], [3], and by 1987, 101 serotypes (1A and 1B to 100) were identified using susceptible cell cultures and specific antisera. many serotypes identified earlier were still circulating. these results suggest HRV serotypes are stable and do not undergo influenza virus-like antigenic drift. Molecular typing involves PCR amplification of a portion of the target viral genome, sequencing and phylogenetic analyses. in this report, we analyzed clinical specimens from sick infants with a new molecular method. we identified 26 new HRV strains including 9 that constitute a new HRV group. PCR fragment B (about 390 bps) was generated with pan-HRV PCR forward primer P1-1 and reverse primer P3-1. equimolar mixture of reverse primers P2-1, P2-2 and P2-3 were used for molecular typing assay. phylogenetic tree depicts the relationships between all 101 HRV serotypes in the P1-P2 region of 5'NCR. tree was constructed using the neighbor joining method according to the distances (divergences) between all pairs of sequences in a multiple alignment. only significant bootstrap values were shown. the nucleotide divergence between the clinical isolates and the respective reference strain was lower at the P1-P2 region (mean 3.5%, range 0\u20138%) than at the NIm-1A region (mean 9.6%, range 5\u201313%) this result agreed with previous reports that nucleotide sequences were more conserved at the NCRs than the coding region due to the preservation of conserved RNA structure elements within the NCR[31], [32]. HRV was detected in 108 samples (60%). other viruses detected were enterovirus, RSV, adenovirus, coronavirus, influenza A virus, metapneumovirus and parainfluenza virus. samples contained 2 different HRVs. serotypes were assigned to 49 HRVs by phylogenetic tree reconstruction. one assignment (HRV20) had a low but still significant bootstrap value (52%) 91 97 HRV54 1 96 99 HRV52 1 89 96 HRV61 2 93 95 HRV83 1 99 98 a) The first 19 serotypes are HRVA. HRV14, 27, 52 and 83, are HRVB. we propose that they represent a new HRV genetic group (HRVC) none of the new strains clustered with HRVB viruses. seventeen new strains (blue) belonged to HRVA group. 9 strains (red) cluster into a new group (\u201cC\u201d) that is separate from groups A and B. HRVC was distinct from human enterovirus (HEV) HEVs are closely related to HRVs [1], and comprise >65 distinct serotypes that include polioviruses, coxsackieviruses A and B, echoviruses and the newer numbered EVs. phylogenetic tree reconstruction was performed with the P1-P2 sequences of 9 HRVC strains. 97.5% of all serotype pairs had >9% pairwise nucleotide divergence. maximum pairwise divergences (%) of P1-P2 sequences among HRVA and HRVB viruses were 33% and 27% respectively. phylogenetic tree reconstruction confirms that the 101 P1-P2 sequences clustered into 2 previously defined genetic groups. the topology of the P1-P2 tree was similar to that of the VP1 and VP4-VP2 trees [28], [29], [30]. the 101 HRV serotypes clustered into 2 previously defined groups. HRVA group had 76 serotypes and HRVB, 25 serotypes. degenerate primers EV292 and EV222 for PCR amplification were not sensitive enough. nucleotide sequences were more conserved at the NCRs than the coding region due to the preservation of conserved RNA structure elements within the NCR[31], [32]. this result agreed with previous reports that nucleotide sequences were more conserved at the NCRs than the coding region due to the preservation of conserved RNA structure elements. HRV was detected in 108 samples (60%). other viruses detected were enterovirus, RSV, adenovirus, coronavirus and parainfluenza virus. 3 HRVs clustered with HRV89 reference sequence with insignificant bootstrap values (42\u201350%). HRV36 has 97% identity with HRV89 in the P1\u2013P2 region. 54 HRVs clustered into 26 new unique strains with high degree of nucleotide divergence from nearest reference serotypes. different new HRVs of the same strain had a high degree of identity among themselves. seventeen of the new strains clustered with group A HRV. seventeen new strains (blue) belonged to HRVA group. 9 strains (red) cluster into a new group (\u201cC\u201d) that is separate from groups A and B. new HRV Strain # Detected Divergence from the Nearest Refererence. phylogenetic tree reconstruction was performed with the P1-P2 sequences of 9 HRVC strains. the results indicate that HRVC viruses are distinct from HEV. the pairwise divergence of P1-P2 sequences between a HRVC strain and the nearest HEV ranged from 31% to 35%. new strains were detected with a sensitive molecular method to type HRV directly from the original clinical specimens. phylogenetic tree reconstruction has been shown to be more accurate than the other sequence analysis methods for molecular typing of enteroviruses. multiple epidemiologic studies of serotype circulation conducted between 1975\u20131983 showed that >90% of the field isolates could be identified with the 90 serotype-specific antisera (HRV1A through HRV89) prepared before 1973. many serotypes identified earlier were still circulating [8], [11] [6], [7], suggesting almost all HRV serotypes had already been identified. only one possible new serotype, HRV-Hanks, was reported in the next 20 the P1-P2 phylogenetic tree revealed that HRV-QPM and one of our new HRVA viruses, W24, were the same strain and thus supported McErlean's conclusion that HRV-QPM was a group A virus. the 8 NY HRVs and HRV-QPM were related to the same cluster within HRVA group. however, our 9 HRVC strains form a distinct group separated from both HRVA and HRVB. the number of HRV strains has been markedly underestimated by traditional viral culture and serotyping techniques. the inability to culture these viruses suggests receptor utilization or other growth requirements are distinct. the development of molecular assays for the detection and analysis of respiratory viruses provides important tools for new epidemiologic and mechanistic studies to address these questions. 85 children who completed the first year of the study, 27 infants had frequent (5) moderate to severe respiratory illnesses. samples from 26 were available for further study. infected cell lysates of 79 additional HRV clinical isolates were obtained from Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene. the supernatant aqueous phase (700 l) was mixed with 600 l isopropanol. the mixture was pelleted for 10 minutes, washed once with 75% ethanol. to make cDNA, 16 l of RNA solution was mixed with 24 l of reaction solution. cloning and sequencing of the 5'NCR of 101 reference HRV serotypes. 5'NCR sequences were available for only a fraction of 101 serotypes. reverse primer was selected for each of the 101 serotypes within a region corresponding to bases 1000-1100 of HRV16 near the 5' end of VP2 gene. the PCR product, a DNA fragment of about 900 bp covering 75% of the 5'NCR, complete VP4 gene and about 200 bases of VP2 gene (PCR fragment A of Figure 1), was isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis. the RMA assay was added to a tube containing 23 l Platinum PCR SuperMix HF, 1 l of forward primer P1-1 (25 M) and 1 l of each reverse primer P2-1 (25 M), P2-2 (25 M) and P2-3 (25 M) the reaction started with 2 min at 94\u00b0C, followed by a 'touchdown' cycle. this reaction produces a PCR product of 390 bp (Figure 1, fragment B). 6 additional plasmids were generated for each new sequence (NIm-1A or P1-P2) and 101 homologous reference sequences using Clustalwith default alignment. a phylogenetic tree with bootstrap values and a matrix of % pairwise nucleotide divergence (distance100%) were generated for each new sequence (NIm-1A or P1-P2) a new isolate or detection was assigned the serotype to which it clustered with in the phylogenetic tree. if the P1-P2 sequence did not cluster with one of the 101 known serotypes in the phylogenetic tree, it was designated as a new strain (prefixed with W) the threshold pairwise divergence value (9%) for assigning a new strain was determined after considering the pairwise divergence values between reference serotypes and clinical isolates of infected cell lysates of 79 additional HRV clinical isolates were obtained from a prospective birth cohort study in Wisconsin. clinical samples were obtained from two sources. samples were obtained from infants ages 0\u20131 year participating in a prospective birth cohort study. tree with branch length proportional to the divergence of sequences was evaluated by bootstrapping (1000 replicates) bootstrapping values of >700 (70%) indicate the highly significant clustering. values 500 (50%) indicate that the clustering is not statistically significant. oviruses, respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV), parainfluenza viruses, influenza viruses, metapneumoviruses, adenoviruses and coronaviruses. the output signal is expressed as MFI (median fluorescence intensity), and samples with an average signal >6 standard deviations of average negative control signals are considered positive. PCR primer pairs were forward primer P1-1 (CAAGCACTTCTGTYWCCCC) for all serotypes and a serotype-specific reverse primer. a DNA fragment of about 900 bp covering 75% of the 5'NCR, complete VP4 gene and about 200 bases of VP2 gene was isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis. the serotype identity of each sequence was verified by matching of its VP4/VP2 sequence to the respective published sequence. for reverse primers, multiple candidates were designed within highly conserved P2 and P3 regions. for the first PCR, 2.5 l of leftover cDNA was added to a tube containing 23 l Platinum PCR SuperMix HF. the reaction conditions are 2 min at 94\u00b0C, 28 cycles of (20 sec at 94\u00b0C, 30 sec at 52\u00b0C, 40 sec at 68\u00b0C) the final product is a 300 bp DNA fragment (Figure 1, fragment C). this semi-nested PCR protocol requires only 10 copies of cDNA template per sample to produce sufficient product for cloning. fragment C was purified, cloned, and 3 plasmids containing fragment C were isolated and sequence the PCR product (350 bp) was isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis and then sequenced. RNA was amplified by RT-PCR using P1-1 and P3-1 primers. a new isolate or detection was assigned the serotype to which it clustered with in the phylogenetic tree with a significant bootstrap value (>50%) 99%, 98%, 97%, 95%, and 90% of the P1-P2 pairs of all 101 serotypes had >7%, >8%, >9%, >10% and >12% pairwise nucleotide divergence. the pairwise nucleotide divergence of all P1-P2 pairs between clinical isolates and the respective reference serotypes was consistently 8%. therefore, a threshold of 9% is associated with probabilities of 3% and 1% PCR primer pairs were forward primer P1-1 (CAAGCACTTCTGTYWCCCC) for all serotypes and a serotype-specific reverse primer. a DNA fragment of about 900 bp covering 75% of the 5'NCR, complete VP4 gene and about 200 bases of VP2 gene was isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis. the serotype identity of each sequence was verified by matching of its VP4/VP2 sequence to the respective published sequence. for reverse primers, multiple candidates were designed within highly conserved P2 and P3 regions. for the first PCR, 2.5 l of leftover cDNA was added to a tube containing 23 l Platinum PCR SuperMix HF. the reaction conditions are 2 min at 94\u00b0C, 28 cycles of (20 sec at 94\u00b0C, 30 sec at 52\u00b0C, 40 sec at 68\u00b0C) the final product is a 300 bp DNA fragment (Figure 1, fragment C). this semi-nested PCR protocol requires only 10 copies of cDNA template per sample to produce sufficient product for cloning. fragment C was purified, cloned, and 3 plasmids containing fragment C were isolated and sequence the PCR product (350 bp) was isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis and then sequenced. RNA was amplified by RT-PCR using P1-1 and P3-1 primers. a new isolate or detection was assigned the serotype to which it clustered with in the phylogenetic tree. 99%, 98%, 97%, 95% and 90% of the P1-P2 pairs of all 101 serotypes had >7%, >8%, >9%, >10% and >12% pairwise nucleotide divergence. a threshold of 9% is associated with probabilities of 3% and 1% for errors A and B, respectively."}
