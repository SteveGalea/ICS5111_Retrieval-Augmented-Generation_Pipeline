{"summary": "emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) represents a serious medical concern for the treatment of S. aureus infections. emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) represents a serious problem for the treatment of MRSA infections. glycyrrhetinic acid has many properties, including anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, anti-peptic ulcer, and anti-viral activities. it has been reported that the structure of glycyrrhetinic acid is similar to that of cortisone, a steroid hormone. fifty clinical S. aureus strains, including 31 methicillin-sensitive S. aureus strains and 19 MRSA strains, were used in this study. a chemically defined medium supplemented with glucose (50 mM) was prepared. the MICs were determined by using the micro-dilution method. each GRA derivative was adjusted to 4,096 mg/L in TSB. dilutions were prepared in a 96-well microplate (thermo Fisher Scientific, Roskilde, Denmark) the bacterial suspension was diluted to 107 cells/ml with PB. 10 l of the diluted suspension was inoculated into 500 l of PB. dilutions of the reaction mixture (100 l) were plated onto TSA plates. stock solutions (1 g/L) of gentamicin, oxacillin or ofloxacin were prepared in ethanol. the final concentrations of gentamicin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, oxacillin and ofloxacin were 32 mg/L, 32 mg/L, 64 mg/L, 128 mg/L, and 4 mg/L, respectively. the Agilent eArray platform (Agilent Technologies) was used to design the microarray. 13,939 probes (60-mers) were designed for the 2,628 protein-coding genes of S. aureus MW2 (up to five probes per gene) for microarray analyses, the test (GR-SU treatment) and control cDNAs were labeled with Cy3 mono-Reactive Dye and Cy5 mono-Reactive Dye. the bacterial cells were collected after 1, 2, 4 and 8 h of incubation. RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis were performed as described above. hla 5' -GGGGACCATATGATAGAGATT 3' 5' -TGTAGCGAAGTCTGGTGAAA 3' coa 5' -ACAGGGCACAATTACAGGT 3' 5' -CCTGTTTTTCCAATAC 3' nuc 5' -AATCATACGGGTCCTTTCA 3' 5' -CCGTTTCTTTCA 3' icaA 5' -AGTTGTCGACGTTCTAC 3' 5' the CDM was prepared using 2-fold serial dilutions with CDM depleted of all amino acids. then, 10 l of the bacterial culture (1x105 cells) was applied to each well. the minimum dilution rate that showed visible bacterial growth was determined. stock solutions were prepared at a concentration of 20 mg/ml. each GRA derivative was adjusted to 4,096 mg/L in TSB. dilutions were prepared in a 96-well microplate. the data were analyzed for statistically significant differences compared to untreated control at each timepoint by a two-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett\u2019s post hoc test. overnight cultures of S. aureus MW2 were adjusted to 107 cells/ml. 10 L of the bacterial suspension was applied to each well in a 96-well plate. bacterial cells without GR-SU treatment were prepared as the control. cDNA was synthesized from 10 g of total RNA using the FairPlay III microarray labeling kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. gene expression analysis by quantitative PCR Overnight cultures of S. aureus MW2 (108 cells) were inoculated into 5 ml of TSB and aerobically incubated at 37\u00b0C with shaking. when the OD660 reached 0.3, either 1/4 or 1x MIC of GR-SU or GRA was added to the culture. clfA 5' -TACAAGTGCGCCTAGAATGA 3' 5' -TTTGACATAGCCTGCTTGGT 3' hla 5' -GGGGACCATATGATAGAGATT 3' 5' -TGTAGCGAAGTCTGGTGAAA 3' coa 5' -ACAGGGCACAATTACAGGT 3' 5' -GGTGTCGTCGGTTGAGTAT 3' lukS-PV 5' 105 cells were applied to each well after incubation for 24 h at 37\u00b0C. the minimum concentration of each sugar that showed visible bacterial growth was determined.

S. aureus MW2 was treated with 1x MIC and 2x MIC of GR-SU (grey bar) or GRA (white bar) in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer. an untreated bacterial culture was used as a control. a synergistic effect of GRA and GR-SU with gentamycin was found. in the presence of 1/2 MIC of GRA, 4 strains exhibited a 2- to 8-fold decrease in the MIC of oxacillin. in the presence of the 1/4 MIC of GRA, 2 strains also exhibited an 8-fold decrease in the MIC of oxacillin. more than 200 genes exhibited altered expression levels in response to GR-SU. many genes responsible for metabolic and biosynthetic pathways also exhibited altered expression patterns. expression levels of 6 genes involved in protein synthesis, 10 genes in RNA synthesis and 2 genes in amino acid metabolism were increased. ed RNAIII expression at 1/4 MIC exhibited a pattern similar to that of RNAIII. overnight cultures of S. aureus MW2 (108 cells) were inoculated into 5 ml of TSB. overnight cultures of S. aureus MW2 were inoculated into 5 ml of TSB. a quantitative PCR was performed using cDNA as the template DNA. we hypothesized that GRA and GR-SU may inhibit the growth of S. aureus by influencing amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism. MICs were evaluated using 50 S. aureus strains (19 MRSA strains and 31 MSSA strains) the MICs of GR-K and GR-S were higher than GA, GR-SU and GR-SA. the MICs ranged from 64 to 512 mg/L and from 16 to 256 mg/L. 2048 256 128 1024 512 SA5046 1024 64 512 512 512 SA5052 4096 128 512 512 512 SA5053 1024 16 32 2048 2048 SA5056 >4096 128 512 512 512 512 SA5053 1024 16 32 2048 2048 SA5056 >4096 128 512 512 512 512 512 SA5053 1024 16 32 2048 2048 SA5056 >4096 128 512 512 256 SA5064 4096 256 512 1024 1024 SA5066 2048 64 128 256 128 SA5067 1024 64 128 256 >4096 1024 SA5071 2048 64 128 >4096 >4096 SA5073 2048 256 256 2048 1024 aDipotassium glycyrrhizate bdisodium succinoyl glycyrrhetinate cGlycy 100 l of bacterial culture was inoculated into 5 ml of TSB. different concentrations of GR-SU or GRA were added to the medium. the growth and colony counts were monitored. the colony forming units were determined as the total number of colonies identified on each plate. the antibacterial effect was calculated as the ratio of the number of surviving cells to the total number of bacteria incubated. the data were analyzed for statistically significant differences compared to the untreated control. in the presence of the 1/4 MIC of GRA, 2 strains also exhibited an 8-fold decrease in the MIC of gentamicin. in the presence of the 1/8 MICs of GRA or GR-SU, increased MICs were not observed in any of the antibiotics tested. expression levels of 6 genes involved in protein synthesis, 10 genes in RNA synthesis and 2 genes in amino acid metabolism were increased. levels of 8 genes for RNA synthesis, 12 genes for carbohydrate metabolism and 8 genes for amino acid metabolism were decreased. overnight cultures of S. aureus MW2 (108 cells) were inoculated into 5 ml of TSB and aerobically incubated at 37\u00b0C with shaking. when the OD at 660 nm reached 0.3, 1/4 MIC (a, c) or 1x MIC (b, d) of GR-SU or GRA was added to the culture. we hypothesized that GRA and GR-SU may inhibit the growth of S. aureus by influencing amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism. we investigated sugar and amino acid requirements in the presence of GRA, GR-SU or GRA-K (1/2 MIC or 1/4 MIC at the final concentration for each agent) GR-SU is synthesized from GRA by adding a succinic acid moiety to increase water solubility. both GR-SU and GR-K have high water solubility, but the antibacterial effect of GR-K is much lower than that of GR-SU. glycyrrhetinic acid derivatives are known anti-inflammatory drugs. bactericidal activity of GRA and GR-SU at a 2x MIC dose. expression levels of many phage-related genes increased by the addition of 1x MIC of GR-SU. expression levels of many genes involved in sugar, amino acid and nucleic acid were significantly decreased. the expression of RNAIII was fully repressed by GRA and GR-SU. RNAIII is responsible for the regulation of many S. aureus virulence factors. we found that GRA and GR-SU suppressed growth in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that RNAIII expression was inhibited. various concentrations of GR-SU or GRA were added to the medium. growth and colony counts were monitored during growth. three independent experiments were performed, and the mean SD was calculated."}
