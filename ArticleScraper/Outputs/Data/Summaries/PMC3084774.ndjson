{"summary": "the development of DNA vaccines is widely considered to be one of the most important medical advancements of the 20th century. new techniques need to be developed and employed to combat a new generation of diseases and infections. initial in vivo EP DNA vaccine studies evaluated gene expression and immune stimulation from delivery of plasmids encoding either Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) protein or human immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) protein, gag, to the muscle. results confirm increased humoral responses to HBV [6] and cellular [9] immune response to HIV gag from EP compared to injection only (IO of plasmid DNA) electrodes developed for skin EP include: caliper, plate, tweezer, and clip electrodes. electrodes developed for skin EP include: caliper, plate, tweezer, and clip electrodes. guinea pigs were anesthetized with 2.5\u20133.0% isoflurane before and during all procedures. guinea pigs were anesthetized with 2.5\u20133.0% isoflurane before and during all procedures. gWizTM HBsAg encodes for the surface antigen of Hepatitis B. plasmid encodes for the surface antigen of Hepatitis B. the plate was blocked with 3% BSA in PBST for 2 hours at 37\u00b0C. serum samples were two-fold diluted in blocking buffer. AP substrate, pNPP, (Sigma) was added to colorize and plate read at 405 nm. a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of South Florida, College of Medicine vivarium. all animals were housed, handled and utilizing following guidelines of the United States National Institutes of Health. guinea pigs whose tissue was collected for plasmid expression were sacrificed 48 hours after one treatment and the tissue was snap frozen. skin samples taken 48 hours after treatment were frozen, sectioned, and placed on slides. samples collected at 96 hours frozen, sectioned, and placed on slides were stained with H & E to determine the extent of cellular infiltrate/inflammation. guinea pigs were treated as described with or without EP using the MEA. IO samples show slight increases in infiltrate as compared to no treatment control. I+EP groups contained primarily macrophages and multi-lobed cells. expression of plasmid was evaluated at 48 hrs post treatment. a more accurate measure is the induction of specific antibodies generated against HBsAg. guinea pigs were treated as described in Methods 2.1 with pHBsAg. expression of HBsAg is seen in IO and I+EP animals. guinea pigs were treated as described and tissue samples harvested 96 hours after treatment. induction of immune cell infiltrate was observed. edema was seen in all samples except no treatment controls. in most samples tissue damage and necrosis were not seen. however, two EP delivered samples had minimal ulcerations at 96 hours after treatment, one of which also had about 1% necrosis. IO and EP n = 6 for each experiment with 3 independent experiments conducted. results demonstrate that the MEA can be effective for the use in electrically mediated DNA vaccination in a human-like skin model. EP has been shown to have an adjuvant effect by recruiting immune cells to the site of pulse application. this is most likely a combination of an EP mediated adjuvant effect and increased plasmid expression. our GMT's are likely to still be within the protective range without generating unnecessary additional responses. the most recent comparable publication evaluated a minimally invasive device for protective vaccination against influenza [62]."}
