{"summary": "SARI is an acute respiratory infection with fever, cough and hospitalisation and is used for surveillance in acute care settings globally. a better understanding of global variability in the epidemiology and care provided for critically ill patients with SARI is lacking. all patients admitted over a 1-week period during peak respiratory infection season in northern and southern hemispheres were enrolled. hospitals and intensive care units were sampled through convenience, due to participation in prior studies or involvement with ongoing research networks. all statistical significance was assessed at the 5% level of significance (two-sided p0.05) analysis was performed using STATA V.14 statistical software. data collection was facilitated through open-access clinical protocols, case report forms and web-based data entry through secure servers. analysis The data were first checked for completeness and missing values. statistical significance was assessed at the 5% level of significance (two-sided p0.05) east Asia and Pacific 206 (30.2) South Asia 35 (5.1) North America 184 (27.0) Europe and Central Asia 63 (9.2) Middle East and North Africa 3 (0.4) Latin America and the Caribbean 3 (0.4) Age group (%) 0\u201310 205 (30.0) 11\u201320 24 (3.5) 21\u201330 30 (4.4) 31\u201340 32 (4.6) 41\u201350 52 (7.6) 51\u201360 63 (9.2) 61\u201370 103 (15.1) 71\u201380 80 ( patients without a documented infectious aetiology were 66.9% (456 of 682) the most commonly diagnosed pathogen was influenza virus (11.6%, 77 of 663) the most commonly diagnosed pathogen was coronavirus (0.92%, 6 of 655) the lack of SARI pathogen-specific diagnostics on recently released Essential Diagnostic Lists exemplifies the lack of clarity on best testing strategies. the lack of SARI pathogen-specific diagnostics on recent releases exemplifies the lack of clarity on best testing strategies.
