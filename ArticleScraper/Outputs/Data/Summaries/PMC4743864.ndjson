{"summary": "at least one respiratory tract pathogen was detected by polymerase chain reaction in 78.6% of the patients. influenza A 33.5%, influenza B 16.4%, respiratory syncytial virus 9.2%, adenovirus 7.8%, rhinovirus 7.1%, coronavirus 7.1%, human metapneumovirus 5.7%, parainfluenza virus 3.5%, coinfection 2.8%. viral respiratory tract infections have a significant place in national health spending because of increased hospital admissions, labour loss of parents and school abseteeisms of children. there are a limited number of studies evaluating viral agents in respiratory tract infections and generally hospitalized patients and lower respiratory tract infections have been examined. study examined the epidemiology of respiratory tract viruses found in nasopharyngeal swab samples of patients aged above 2 years who presented to our pediatric emergency outpatient clinic. the records of 178 patients aged above 2 years who presented to the pediatric emergency outpatient clinic with signs of upper respiratory tract infection in the 2013\u20132014 influenza season were examined retrospectively. association of 37.8\u00b0C with cough or sore throat was defined as 'influenza-like illness' the study was approved by the ethics committee of stanbul University, stanbul Medical Faculty. the data which showed a normal distribution were compared using t-test in independent groups. the other data were compared using Mann-Whitney U test. the limit of significance was accepted as a p value of 0.05 and to be bidirectional. the data were expressed as mean, standard deviation, median, the lowest-the highest value, frequency and percentage. the other data were compared using t-test in independent groups. the other data were compared using Mann-Whitney U test. no difference was found between the viruses in terms of rates of leading to URTI and LRTI. the most common virus was influenza A virus in both groups. the second most common virus was influenza B in the group above 5 years of age (p=0.008) and RSV in the 2\u20135-year age group (p=0.003) the symptom period was found to be similar in both groups. the other respiratory tract viruses made two peaks in January and march. headache and malaise-myalgia were markedly more common in cases of influenza (p=0.01, p0.001, respectively) influenza vaccine was administered in only 6 of a total of 140 patients (4.2%). p Age, median (the lowest-the highest) 6.5 (2.5\u201316.0) 4.5 (2.5\u201314.0) 0.001 Gender, male/female n (%) 46/24 (65.7/34.3) 36/34 (51.4\u201348.6) 0.086 Age group, n (%) 2\u20135 years 27 (38.6) 42 (60) 0.011 >5 years 43 (61.4) 28 0.038 Lymphocytes 1 950 (500\u20136 100) 2 450 (450\u201310 470) 0.006 CRP 7 (0\u201374) 18 (0\u2013200) Hospitalization in ICU, n (%) 2 (2.9) 1 (1.4) 0.559 Hospitalization time, days, median (the lowest-the highest) 7 (4\u201314) 6 (4\u201321) 0.078 CRP: C reactive protein. the leukocyte and neutrophil counts, CRP values and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratios at presentation were markedly higher in the patients who were hospitalized. on the other hand, the eosinophil counts in the patients who required hospitalization were markedly lower compared to the outpatients. at least one viral respiratory tract pathogen was found in 78.6% of our patients with molecular method (multiplex PCR) this rate has been found to range between 41.8% and 67.8% in limited number of studies performed in this area in our country. multiplex PCR kits which could identify 115 respiratory tract pathogens were used in some other studies conducted in turkey. in the 2013\u20132014 winter season, an influenza epidemic was experienced. in one study which was conducted in the 2010\u20132011 season, influenza viruses were found only with a rate of 12.6% (14) the relationship between the disease severity and identification of multiple viral agents is still unclear. the age of the patients with influenza viruses was older compared to the patients with other respiratory tract infections. the most prominent difference between the age groups was observed in RSV and influenza B infections. there are many definitions of influenza-like illness made with this objective. none has been found to be sufficiently sensitive and specific to describe influenza infection. influenza viruses were identified in 56% of these patients. the respiratory tract viruses observed commonly in the mild temperate zone which also includes our country have typical seasonal distributions. it has been shown that respiratory syncitial virus and influenza make a peak in winter months and RSV generally emerges earlier (16). neutrophilic leukocytosis, elevated CRP and elevated procalcitonin were found with a markedly higher rate in the patients who were hospitalized. eosinopenia may be used as a prognostic marker in differentiating infectious and non-infectious conditions and in identifying the severity of infection. low eosinophil count at presentation."}
