{"summary": "several recently emerging pathogenic viruses belong to the Bunyavirales order. the genus Orthobunyavirus includes more than 170 named viruses. some of the viruses cause important diseases in humans, livestock and crops. ruminants have abortions and congenital malformations, while ruminants have congenital malformations. a new orthobunyavirus emerged in the summer of 2011. the risk of transmission of SBV to humans was considered low. the same viruses cannot overcome the innate immune response of non-susceptible species. the same viruses cannot overcome the innate responses of non-susceptible species. the same viruses cannot overcome the innate responses of non-susceptible species. sheep and cows possess two BST2 paralogs, BST2A and BST2B. it lacks predicted glycosylation sites and a carboxy terminal GPI anchor. this protein is retained within the Golgi apparatus. in this study, we investigated the role of BST-2 in determining orthobunyavirus host range. polyclonal antibody against the HA tag was obtained from Abcam. HIV p24 was obtained through the NIH AIDS Reagent Program. AKAV was rescued by reverse genetics using the plasmids described below. pUCAKAVST7, pUCAKAVMT7 and pUCAKAVLT7 encode the full-length antigenomic S, M and L AKAV segments. pTM1-SBV-N and pTM1-SBV-L express the N and L proteins of SBV under the control of the T7 promoter. 293-hBST2 or control cells were infected with SBV (MOI of 0.001) and 48 h post-infection supernatants were then collected, filtered and virions pelleted. the remaining cells were washed twice with PBS before they were treated with either dilution buffer (10 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 1 mM CaCl2 and 150 mM NaCl) or subtilisin A (10 g/ml Reactions were cycled on a Stratagene Mx3005 qPCR System (Agilent Technologies) data was analyzed with the Mx3000P software. data is expressed as the log10 relative reduction in expression compared to the cell line expressing a GFP shRNA. luciferase activity was measured using the Dual-Luciferase\u00ae Reporter Assays System (Promega) 24 h later, luciferase activity was measured using the Dual-Luciferase\u00ae Reporter Assays System (Promega) the experiment was performed four times, each time in triplicate. antibody against -tubulin was obtained from Sigma. fluorescent secondary antibody included AlexaFlour 488 or 594 goat anti rabbit. AKAV was rescued by reverse genetics using the plasmids described below. pTM1-SBV-N and pTM1-SBV-L express the N and L proteins of SBV under the control of the T7 promoter. pUCAKAVST7, pUCAKAVMT7 and pUCAKAVLT7 encode full-length antigenomic S, M and L AKAV segments. the remaining cells were washed twice with PBS before they were treated with either PBS, dilution buffer (10 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 1 mM CaCl2 and 150 mM NaCl) or subtilisin A (10 g/ml dilution buffer) the reaction was stopped by the addition of 10% FBS DMEM and 5 mM of PMSF and supernatants. RNA was reverse transcribed using a SBV specific primer (5\u2032 TTCGCGCCCAGGTGCAAATC 3\u2032) with AccuScript HF reverse transcriptase following manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was used for qRT-PCR using the Brilliant III Ultra Fast QPCR master mix as indicated by the manufacturer. HEK 293T cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing the hBST2 gene or an empty plasmid as a control. 14 h post-transfection cells were infected with SBV at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI 0.001). all cells expressed hBST2 by transduction with retroviral vectors carrying hBST2 tagged with the HA epitope. we found a 10-fold reduction in the titers of SBV produced in 293-hBST2 cells compared to those obtained in 293-control. the restriction of SBV in 293-hBST2 cells could be partially overcome by transient transfection of a plasmid expressing HIV-1 Vpu. representative experiment showed SBV growth kinetics in 293-hBST2 and control cells transfected with 500 ng of an expression plasmid of HIV-1 VPU or an empty plasmid (pCI) before infection with SBV. if hBST2 blocks SBV entry, we would find a reduction in the number of virus positive cells early after infection. 293-hBST2 and control cells were infected with SBV and 48 h post-infection virions were stripped from the cell surface by protease treatment. hBST2 does not induce the accumulation of SBV within the cytoplasm or cell membrane of infected cells. 293-hBST2 and 293-control cells were infected with SBV at a MOI of 0.001 and 48 h post infection cells were lysed and analyzed by western blotting using a SBV N antibody. -tubulin was used to equilibrate protein loading. er of cell-associated SBV preparations derived from 293-hBST2 lower compared to control cells in each of three independent experiments. we found a significant reduction in the amount of intracellular SBV N in lysates derived from 293-hBST2 compared to control cells in each of three independent experiments. hBST2 restricts SBV replication by reducing the amount of envelope glycoproteins in viral particles. 293-hBST2 and 293-control cells were infected and 48 h later supernatants collected, filtered and the number of viral genomes quantified by qRT-PCR. 8 h post infection cells were fixed and stained by immunofluorescence using an antiserum against SBV N. the number of SBV infected cells was counted (10 fields of view per condition) and compared between groups. three independent experiments were carried out using three viral preparations. a significant decrease in the Gc/N ratio in SBV virions produced in 293-hBST2 suggesting that viral envelope protein incorporation is hampered by hBST2. we quantified the amount of Gc in total cells lysates of 293-hBST2 and 293-control cells. hBST2 restricts replication of AKAV and SATV (approximately 100 fold at 48 hpi) on the other hand, hBST2 is unable to restrict replication of OROV and LACV, both human orthobunyaviruses and humans. cells were infected with SBV at a MOI of 0.01 and virus titers assessed at 24 and 48 h post-infection. data was analyzed using a 2-way ANOVA. 93-oBST2A and 293-oBST2B cell lines are shown in Fig. 4C. the data suggest that there is a correlation between the capacity of BST2 to restrict orthobunyavirus replication and their host range. we assessed the replication kinetics of some of the viruses described above in primary sheep and human fibroblasts. we observed a substantial difference in the Gn/N ratio between SBV and OROV. we attribute this difference to the differences in sensitivities of each of the antibodies used against each viral protein. control and 14 h post-transfection cells were infected with SBV at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI 0.001). we then developed HEK 293T cells stably expressing hBST2 (termed 293-hBST2) by transduction with retroviral vectors carrying hBST2 tagged with the HA epitope or an empty retroviral vector. 293-hBST2 and 293-control cells were transfected with 500 ng of an expression plasmid of hBST2 or an empty plasmid before infection with SBV (MOI 0.001) hBST2 does not affect the early stages of the SBV replication cycle nor the intracellular localization of its nucleocapsid protein We infected 293-hBST2. 293-hBST2 and control cells were infected with SBV. if hBST2 blocks SBV entry, we would find a reduction in the number of virus positive cells early after infection. if hBST2 blocks SBV entry, we would find a reduction in the number of virus positive cells early after infection. 293-hBST2 and 293-control cells were infected at a MOI of 0.001 and 48 h post infection virions were released from the cytoplasm by freeze and thaw cycles. results show the average and standard deviation of three independent experiments performed in triplicates. values represent the average of four independent experiments. we quantified and compared the amount of intracellular infectious virus in 293-hBST2. 293-hBST2 and 293-control cells were infected and viral RNA quantified at 1, 2 and 5 h post-infection by qRT-PCR. no statistically significant differences in the amount of viral RNAs in cells expressing hBST2 compared to control cells. hBST2 restricts SBV replication by reducing the amount of envelope glycoproteins in viral particles. 8 h post-infection CPT-Tert cells were fixed and stained by immunofluorescence using an antiserum against SBV N. the number of SBV positive cells was counted and compared between groups. the graph displays the average of the Gc/N ratio of at least five independent experiments. the data is expressed relative to the expression of control cells at 22 h post-infection. hBST2 is unable to restrict the replication of AKAV and SATV. hBST2 restricts the replication of AKAV and SATV in 293-hBST2 and 293-control cells. data was analyzed using a 2-way ANOVA. 293-oBST2A and 293-oBST2B cells were infected at a MOI of 0.01. data was analyzed using a 2-way ANOVA. orthobunyaviruses with ruminant tropism are restricted by hBST2 while orthobunyaviruses with human tropism are not. to this end, we developed HEK 293T cell lines stably expressing the ovine orthologues of BST-2 (oBST2A and oBST2B) we found that the replication of orthobunyaviruses with only ruminant tropism (SBV, AKAV the levels of BST-2 knockdown are shown in Fig. 4F. we then examined the ability of the human and ovine orthologues to modulate the incorporation of envelope glycoprotein into virions. virions in the supernatants were pelleted followed by western blot analysis. orthologues of BST-2 restrict orthobunyavirus replication in a host-specific manner. we found a correlation between the ability of orthobunyaviruses to replicate in the presence of different BST-2 orthologues in vitro and the range of their susceptible hosts. some restriction factors such as BST-2 are constitutively expressed in some cell types. these factors are often referred to as part of the \u201cintrinsic\u201d immune response of the host as they are available in the cell even before pathogens are sensed. this indicates that the host range of these viruses does not totally depend on receptor availability or other factors required for viral replication. the role of BST-2 in influencing orthobunyavirus host range will likely derive from a variety of factors including its sites and timing of expression and its efficiency of restriction of a given virus. the most common mechanism of viral restriction by BST-2 described so far involves the physical attachment of virions to the cell membrane of infected cells. the same orthologue expressed in the same cell line has a different impact on replication of different orthobunyaviruses. restriction is not impacted by the addition of inhibitors of the proteasome thus discarding the possibility that BST-2 can induce the degradation of viral proteins. this study provides for the first time clear clues on one of the host genetic barriers these viruses face to establish themselves in a new host species."}
