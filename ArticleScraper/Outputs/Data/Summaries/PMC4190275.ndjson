{"summary": "TGF- family is a group of structurally related growth factors. they include TGF-, activin, nodal, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and others. these growth factors play critical roles in regulating biological processes during embryonic development. clathrin-mediated endocytosis is the best characterized pathway. receptors are first concentrated on the clathrin-coated pits. clathrin-coated pits undergo invagination and then pinch off from the plasma membrane. caveolae mediates internalization of proteins such as choleratoxin, glycosylphosphatidylinositol, endothelin receptor, and growth hormone receptor. internalized cargos are transported to not well-characterized caveosomes and eventually to later endosomes or lysosomes. internalization of TGF- receptors through clathrin-dependent endocytosis to EEA1-positive endosomes is more enter cells via lipid raft/caveolae and are found in caveolin-positive vesicles. internalization of TGF- receptors through clathrin-dependent endocytosis enhances TGF--Smad signaling. c-Cbl neddylates TRII and facilitates its clathrin-dependent endocytosis. c-Cbl-mediated neddylation could target TRII into EEA1-positive early endosomes and prevent its endocytosis to caveolin-positive compartments. c-Cbl stabilizes TRII by attenuating its ubiquitination and degradation. c-Cbl mutations contribute to leukemia by negatively regulating the activity and stability of receptor tyrosine kinases. our biochemical analyses reveal that PICK1 directly interacts with the C-terminus of TRI via its PDZ domain. PICK1 increases caveolin-mediated endocytosis, ubiquitination, and degradation of TRI and suppresses TGF- signaling. previous studies associated the deviant expression of PICK1 in brain with mental disorders such as schizophrenia. dapper2 interacts with TRI/ALK5 and activin receptor ActRIB/ALK4 in the Rab7-positive late endosomes. it accelerates their lysosomal degradation, suggesting that dapper2 facilitates the transport of endocytosed receptors from late endosomes to lysosomes. however, its detailed mechanism is unclear. TGF- receptors localized in lipid raft/caveolae and caveolin-1-positive vesicles undergo ubiquitination. TSC-22 competes with Smad7/Smurfs for TRI binding and therefore decreases the ubiquitination and degradation of the receptor, leading to enhanced TGF- signaling. the regulation of TGF- receptor expression is also important. microRNA miR-24 reduces the mRNA and protein levels of human activin type I receptor ALK4 (ALK4) by targeting the 3\u2032-untranslated region of ALK4 mRNA and inhibits activin signaling. p21-activated kinase 2 (PAK2) can directly phosphorylate Smad2 at Ser417, which interferes with the TRI-Smad2 association. p21-activated kinase 2 (PAK2) can directly phosphorylate Smad2 at Ser417, which interferes with the TRI-Smad2 association. virus nucleocapsid protein (SARS-CoV N protein) shares little homology with the N proteins of other known coronaviruses. SARS-CoV N interacts with Smad3 and enhances Smad3-p300 interaction. Smad7 directly binds to DNA and represses TGF- signaling. oligonucleotide pull-down assays and single-molecule force spectroscopy studies showed that Smad7 binds to DNA through its MH2 domain and thus represses TGF- signaling by interfering with the functional R-Smads/Smad4-DNA complex formation on the target gene promoters. Yin Yang 1 (YY1), a ubiquitously expressed transcription repressor, is a critical cooperator of Smad7 in degradation of TGF- receptors is sensitive to the inhibitors of lysosome and proteasome. it is unclear how these two degradation pathways cooperate to achieve full degradation of TGF- receptors. conflict of interests regarding publication of this paper."}
