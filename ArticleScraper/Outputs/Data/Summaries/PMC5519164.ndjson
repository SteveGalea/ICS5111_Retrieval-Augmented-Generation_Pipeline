{"summary": "since its emergence in November 2002, the SARS-CoV had induced 8,096 cases, including 774 deaths, in 37 countries within 8 months. no new outbreaks have been reported since 2004 [3], reported biosecurity breaches of SARS-CoV specimens in research facilities [4\u20137] and continuous findings of SARS-like coronaviruses in wild animals [8\u201310] suggest the distinct potential for a resurgence of SARS [11\u201313]. a multi-agent model was developed to simulate the possible spread of the viruses from the index patient to the susceptible by air flow and surface touching. the outbreak occurred in a general medical ward, Ward 8A, in early March 2003 [31]. virus-containing droplet size dg = 100 m, dose\u2013response parameters in respiratory tracts r = 3.2/mRNA copy and on mucous membranes m = 3.2 103/mRNA copy. infection patterns of inpatients were studied because their behaviour was simpler than that of HCWs and visitors. patients exhibited a clear pattern (P = 0.0015, Pearson chi-square test) with the highest attack rate (0.6500, 13 of 20 inpatients) in the source cubicle (including Beds 9x, 9\u201316 and 16x), a little lower (0.5238, 11 of 21 inpatients) in the adjacent cubicle (including Beds 17x, 17\u201324 and 24x) and lowest (0.1818, 6 of 33 inpatients) in the remote cubicles (including Beds a multi-agent model was used to model the spread of the SARS-CoV from the index patient to the susceptible and predict the infection risk distribution from the three hypotheses. eighteen types of representative surfaces were identified (Table A in S1 File) and categorised into five types of material: porous surfaces, non-porous surfaces, toilet surfaces, skin and mucous membranes. generator was used to create representative individuals in the outbreak. each agent corresponded to a person in the outbreak. maximizing fit was selected as the approach to model selection. the viral load coefficient was defined as the ratio of the viral load in the computation to the average values in [33] r, m and cL were combined as the products rcL and mcL, defined as the dose effects of introducing cL mRNA copies of SARS-CoV. the outbreak occurred in a general medical ward, Ward 8A, in early March 2003. the index patient was a 26-year-old man who developed fever and cough on February 24, 2003. he was treated with salbutamol via a jet nebulizer four times a day from March 6 to March 12 to facilitate mucociliary clearance. the intensity of red shading represents levels of attack rate or infection risk. seven groups of people are assumed to be involved in transmission during the exposure period, including inpatients, visitors, doctors, nurses, health assistants, cleaners and medical students. the infection patterns of inpatients were studied because their behaviour was simpler than that of HCWs and visitors. inpatients examined a random nine or ten inpatients in a cubicle. each doctor and each nurse examined them in clockwise and anticlockwise directions. uncertain parameters related to properties of SARS-CoV were assumed. the initialization generator, simulation engine, global database and data processing module were used to build the virtual physical environment and produce surfaces. eighteen types of representative surfaces were identified (Table A in S1 File) in this study, \u2018mucous membranes\u2019 refer in particular to the exposure site for the fomite route. maximizing fit was selected as the approach to model selection [38]. in this approach, the residual sum of squares (RSS) as a measure of fit was selected. r and m were assumed to be 101\u2013101 and 104\u2013102 respectively. the ratio of r to m should have been in the range of 101\u2013105. 1,744 scenarios were considered in the study. two-way airflow occurred at each inner opening in the ward [35] so some airborne droplets spread to other cubicles by airflow. the aerosol concentration in the source cubicle was much higher than that in the adjacent cubicle. the difference between infection risks in the source and adjacent cubicles was very large (1:0.43 in this scenario) inpatients share a similar infection risk of 0.07 for the six routine round patterns considered here. infection risk distributions vary for the six routine round patterns considered here. the difference between infection risks in the source and adjacent cubicles was too small. hypotheses with the best fitness in different scenarios Fig 4 shows the minimum RSS. dg denotes the largest virus-containing droplet size (4 values: 50, 100, 150 and 200 m); rcL and mcL denote products of viral load coefficient and dose\u2013response parameters in respiratory tracts. in all scenarios (the biggest dot) was 0.5505, and the small black dots represent scenarios with the minimum RSS at least five times as much as 0.5505. in Fig 4, the prediction of Hypothesis 1 [Long air] (red dots) fitted best with the reported data. the minimum RSS of other patterns in Hypotheses 3 are smaller than those of the two single-route modes, 1.0394 at least. hypothesis 3 [Long air + Fomite] was more possible than the two single-route hypotheses. among the 6 patterns in Hypothesis 3, the minimum RSS of pattern 5 was smallest (0.5105) dg denotes the largest virus-containing droplet size 2. rcL and mcL denote products of viral load coefficient and dose\u2013response parameters in respiratory tracts and on mucous membranes. dg denotes the largest virus-containing droplet size. rcL and mcL denote products of viral load coefficient and dose\u2013response parameters in respiratory tracts and on mucous membranes. the fomite route plays a non-negligible role in transmission, contributing at least 37% to the infection risk. experimental investigations of SARS-CoV are lacking mainly because of safety considerations [18], and several authors have suggested 229E, a low-virulence human coronavirus [45], as a surrogate. in future, more experimental measurements of parameters for the biological properties of SARS-CoV or the surrogate, 229E, are needed. the spatial distribution of infection risk was similar to that of the reported attack rates (Fig 3A), i.e., highest in the source cubicle, lower in the adjacent cubicle and lowest in the remote cubicles. due to the small temperature differences between zones, two-way airflow occurred at each inner opening in the ward [35], so some virus-containing airborne droplets spread to other cubicles by airflow. infection risk always reaches its highest value in inpatients visited by HCWs after the index patient. but inpatients had the same opportunities to contact common surfaces. common surfaces reduced difference between viruses received by each inpatient from HCWs and contributed to uniform infection risk distribution. the difference between infection risks in the source and adjacent cubicles was too large (1:0.35 in this scenario) the difference between infection risks in the source and remote cubicles was too small (1:0.52 in this scenario), not consistent with the large difference (1:0.80) in the reported attack rate distribution. hypotheses with the best fitness (the minimum RSS) in different scenarios Fig 4 shows the hypotheses with the best fitness in different scenarios. dot diameter is inversely proportion to the value of RSS. the smallest RSS in all scenarios (the biggest dot) was 0.5505. the small black dots represent scenarios with the minimum RSS at least five times as much as 0.5505. s membranes m was 3.2 103/mRNA copy [40] and that parameter in respiratory tracts r was 103 times higher than that on the mucous membranes. the high viral load coefficients support other studies suggesting that the index patient was a super-spreader [42\u201344] hypotheses 3 [Long air + Fomite] are smaller than those of the two single-route modes, 1.0394 at least. dg denotes the largest virus-containing droplet size 2. rcL and mcL denote products of viral load coefficient and dose\u2013response parameters in respiratory tracts and on mucous membranes. dg denotes the largest virus-containing droplet size 2. dg denotes the largest virus-containing droplet size 2. rcL and mcL denote products of viral load coefficient and dose\u2013response parameters in respiratory tracts and on mucous membranes. dg denotes the largest virus-containing droplet size 2. ARS-CoV in the multi-agent model were not available, such as the transfer rates between surfaces (Table C in S1 File) and the first-order inactivation rates in the air and on surfaces (Table D in S1 File) several parameters such as dose response parameters might be variable from patient to patient, but the individual differences were not considered in this study. for most of the routine round patterns, SARS-CoV was less probable to transmit via the fomite route alone. the virus might have spread via the long-range airborne route alone. but it was more probable that the virus could transmit in combined routes."}
