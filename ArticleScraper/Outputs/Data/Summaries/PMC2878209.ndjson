{"summary": "nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from 558 children 6 years of age. 486 were hospitalized with acute lower respiratory tract infection. 72 were asymptomatic. confirmation was performed by using primers AG0048 (5\u2032-TGT TTT TCA AGT ATG TTG CAT CC-3\u2032) and AG0049 (5\u2032-CAC CCA AAA GAC ACT TAA AAA-3\u2032) all PCR products for WUPyV and KIPyV were sequenced to confirm the specificity for each virus. PCR product was examined after electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel. male:female ratios of the symptomatic children (1.9:1) and asymptomatic children (1.7:1) did not differ significantly. bronchiolitis for 250 children, pneumonia for 201, and croup for 35. most children in both groups had no additional medical conditions. hCoV-NL63 in 3 patients, hCoV-OC43 in 1 and hCoV-229E in 1. most of the WUPyV infections were detected in may and June. analysis of the KIPyV strains showed the same sequence with the VP-1 region of the KIPyV strain (S1). VP-1 region showed the same sequence with the VP-1 region of the KIPyV strain (S1) our finding of KPyV in 5 (1.0%) of 486 children is similar to that of a previous study. this virus was frequently found in south Korean children with acute lower respiratory tract infections."}
