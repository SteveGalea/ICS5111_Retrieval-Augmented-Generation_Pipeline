{"summary": "study aims to identify trends over time and regional differences in public perceptions and behaviors, as well as predictors of preventive behavior regarding Q fever. remarkably low levels of perceived vulnerability and anxiety, particularly in the region of highest incidence. Q fever is associated with substantial morbidity, but mortality is uncommon (1-2% of cases) in the Netherlands, the first community outbreak of Q fever occurred in the southern region of the Netherlands in 2007, in the southern region of the Netherlands. in 2009, the number of cases reached a peak of 2,357 [7-9] studies on public perceptions and behavioral responses have been conducted during outbreaks of other zoonotic infections, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and avian influenza. but studies on public perceptions and behaviors during Q fever outbreaks have been limited, and they were mainly directed at specific risk groups. the flycatcher panel meets high quality requirements and is ISO-certified. panel members of three regions with different incidences of Q fever were invited to participate in this study. the regions included noord-Brabant (with around 2464 000 inhabitants) and Utrecht and Limburg (with around 2360 000 inhabitants) analysis Data analysis was performed with SPSS for Windows, release 19.0. for all constructs with 3 or more items, Cronbach\u2019s alpha was calculated. for each construct, a summary score was created based on the number of correct answers (range 0\u20137). survey in 2009 for the predictors in the regression analyses, whereas data from the follow-up survey in 2010 were used for the outcome variable (i.e. preventive behavior) all factors with a p-value 0.1 in the univariate analyses were entered in the multivariate model, and removed one-by-one until only statistically significant predictors (p 0.05) remained. en and friesland (with around 1229 000 inhabitants) served as control regions. all respondents to the first survey were invited to participate in the second and third surveys. panel members received 1.50 Euro in credits, which could be exchanged for gift vouchers through the Flycatcher website. for assessing knowledge, a summary score was created based on the number of correct answers (range 0\u20137). we computed the unadjusted bivariate correlations between the study variables using Cram\u00e9rs V and Spearman\u2019s Rho. in the first follow-up survey, all 1609 respondents from the baseline study were invited, and 79% (n = 1263) responded. for the second follow-up survey, 1343 members of the 1609 respondents from the baseline study were invited. 9% 38% 31% 36% 0.04 Marital status Single 17% 19% 25% 20% Married/Cohabitating 80% 72% 69% 74% Divorced/Widowed 4% 9% 5% 6% 0.001 Children 18 years in household Yes 34% 37% 40% 37% No 66% 63% 60% 63% ns aRegion 1 = Noord-Brabant \u2013 high incidence region; bRegion 2 = Utrecht & Limburg bivariate correlationsa for demographic and cognitive variables (survey 2010, n = 1249) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11a 11b 12 13 14 15 16 Variable b 9 Knowledge.07.09.10.16**.08.10.10.17**.11.11.09.12** 1 11a Perceived severity.04.06.05.12**.08.07.04.14**.11**.23** 1 11b Perceived chance.09*.07.05.14**.07.06.07.19** b1 = gender (1: male; 2: female); 2 = age (1: 18\u201330 yrs; 2: 30\u201350 yrs; 3: 50 yrs); 3 = ethnicity (1: native dutch; 2: immigrant); 4 = education (1: low; 2: intermediate; 3: high); 5 = employment status (1: unemployed/retired; 2: married/cohabiting; 3: divorced/widowed); 7 = children in household (1: no the perceived personal susceptibility to Q fever remained stable over time. the perceived chance of getting infected in the coming year decreased between 2010 and 2012. less than 15% of respondents perceiving that they were susceptible. ived chance of getting infected coming year 2 2.22 3 2.20 1 2.03 ns 0.001. fear for Q fever 3 2.11 5 2.23 4 2.12 0.001 (+) 0.001 (+) 0.001 (+) 0.001 (+) 0.001 (+) 0.001 (+) 0.001 (+) 0.001 (+) 0.001 (+) 0.001 (+) 0.001 (+).
