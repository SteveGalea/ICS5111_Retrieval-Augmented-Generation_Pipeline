{"summary": "the quality of ASF as herbal medicine is typically evaluated and controlled by the total alkaloid content. the quality of ASF as herbal medicine is typically evaluated based on the quantitative content of the marker compounds. chromatographic fingerprints are commonly used for qualitative similarity among the test samples. al used a qualitative hierarchical clustering method to analyze the chromatographic fingerprints of the alkaloids from commercial Sophorae Flavescentis Radix. they also determined the content of multiple marker compounds for the purpose of quality assessment. the chromatographic fingerprints of the herbal medicine samples are typically used in identification and authenticity [35\u201336], which only indicates the qualitative similarity in the presence of the chemical components. slope b, calculated according to Eq 2, can be used to quantitatively compare X and Y after correction of apparent weight of SFP (mj) and RFP (mR) the parameter mj is the weight of the jth sample and the parameter mR is the average weight of 27 batches of samples. b is very close to the apparent content similarity R% (seen in Eq 3), and the error e is about less than 3%. r is always less than unity, however b can be in range of 0. weight correction factor should be taken into consideration for homologue fingerprints lying in profiles. Phosphoric acid (HPLC grade) was obtained from Kermel Chemistry Reagent Co., Ltd (Tianjin, China) and anhydrous ethanol (HPLC grade) from Fuyu Fine Chemical Co., Ltd. the extracted liquid was concentrated by recovering the dichloromethane. the residue was dissolved in ethanol. chromatographic analysis was performed on an Agilent 1100 HPLC series. 0.10 g of the sample was weighed into a 50 ml volumetric flask. the flask was sonicated for 15 minutes. the flask was weighed again and any lost ethanol was replenished. a total of 27 batches of ASF samples were self extracted in laboratory. the structures of the three marker compounds are shown in Fig 1.. the structures of the marker compounds are shown in Fig 1. stock standard solutions were prepared by accurately weighing 9.0 mg, 8.0 mg and 8.0 mg of MT, OMT and SPR standards into separate volumetric flasks of 50 ml, 50 ml, 25 ml respectively. the reference standard was dissolved in adequate ethanol and then diluted to volume with ethanol and stored at 4\u00b0C for subsequent use. the assignment of MT, SPR and OMT was carried out by comparing the retention times and on-line UV spectra with those of standards. the HPLC method was validated for linearity, system repeatability, accuracy, limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ) LOD b /ng LOQ c /ng Linear range/g MT y = 1256.8x-12.181 a 0.999998 2.1 6.3 0.2251.800 SPR y = 1240.0x-17.252 0.999993 3.3 10.0 0.2001.600 OMT y = 1124.5x-3.042 0.999991 0.83 2.5 0.0900.720 a y and x were, respectively, the peak areas and masses 04 84.7 86.6 1.9 1.000 86.1 1.4 -0.5 0.006 3 good S3 235.51 248.77 91.73 576.01 102.9 103.2 0.3 1.000 102.9 0.0 -0.3 0.003 1 best S4 236.03 245.87 90.70 572.59 102.2 102.2 102.7 0.5 1.000 102.6 0.4 -0.1 0.000 1 best S5 232.14 243.02 89.59 564.75 3.7 -1.0 1.000 112.6 -2.1 -1.1 0.009 3 good S15 221.87 230.42 84.41 536.70 95.7 97.4 1.7 1.000 96.2 0.5 -1.1 0.012 1 best S16 250.64 260.95 98.17 609.76 109.2 106.9 -2.3 1.000 107.0 -2.3 0.0 0.000 2 better S17 191.30 234.39 85.53 511.22 78.75 492.59 88.1 84.6 -3.5 0.998 85.7 -2.4 1.1 0.012 3 good S27 197.52 218.35 78.83 494.70 88.4 88.5 0.1 0.998 89.3 0.9 0.8 0.009 3 good RFP 228.77 240.79 89.50 559.06 100.0 100.0 0.0 0.000 1 best RS 228.63 237.62 86.59 the samples in Group 2 (S3-S14, S16, S18, S20, S21 and S22) with positive values on PC1 have relatively higher content of the marker compounds. only three samples (S17, S18 and S19) were found to be outliers (outside the ellipse) based on the content of the marker compounds. the reference fingerprint (RFP) with a negative value on PC1 is situated very close to the origin. the validated HPLC method was used to generate chromatographic fingerprints of the ASF samples. at the analytical wavelength of 210 nm, 18 common peaks were found in all samples and the amplified chromatogram was given with labeled peak numbers in Fig 2A. the reference fingerprint (RFP) was constructed as authentically fingerprint by averaging all the 27 sample fingerprints. the qualities of S3, S4, S5, S7, S8, S11, S15, S18, S20, S22 and RS were best (Grade 1), those of S1, S10, S13, S16, S17, S21, S14, S26 and S27 were better (Grade 2), and those of S2, S6, S9, S12, S14, S26 and S27 were better (Grade 3), except for that of S19 as fine (Grade 4) MT peak was selected as the reference standard, we can calculate the relative weight correction factor SPR/MT as f S P R / M T = A S P R m M T A M T m S P R = 1.024 (RSD = 0.77%, n = 5) and OMT/MT as f O M T / M T = A O M T m M T A M T m O M T = 1.118 (RSD = 0.48%, n = the correlation coefficients between Pi% and b are 0.9471, 0.9664 and 0.9597 for MT, SPR and OMT respectively. this indicates that b is highly correlated to the content of the marker compounds. b is also highly correlated to the apparent content similarity (R%) as shown in Fig 5E. the linear regression plots of the content percentage (Pi%) of the marker compounds vs. the linear quantitative similarity (b) we can quantify all fingerprints by RCFP displayed in Fig 4B to give the same results as described in \u2018Evaluating ASF quality by LQPM based on the fingerprint profiling\u2019 section. RCFP can cancel the systematic differences in the different HPLC machines. the average percent content of total alkaloid was 71.3%, as determined by an acid-base back-titration method. about 0.69% of total amino acids were analyzed by visible spectrophotometry at 570 nm with ninhydrin as the developer and l-tyrosine as the reference substance. the methods met the quantitative requirements as the recoveries were found to be between 98.5% and 100.7% (RSD 1.5%). the HPLC method was validated for linearity, system repeatability, accuracy, limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ) the linearity of the method was assessed at six concentration levels of the three marker compounds as described in Table 2. limit of detection (S/N = 3) c LOQ: limit of quantitation (S/N = 10) Sample analysis The content of MT, OMT and SPR in ASF samples and one reference sample (RS) was determined using the validated HPLC method, and the results are reported in milligrams per gram of ASF. the

the individual contents of the marker compounds and the total amount (SUM) as the input data to construct a two-dimensional matrix with 29 observations and 4 variables (29x4) all four variables are positively correlated to PC1 with the sum of three marker compounds having the highest loading on PC1. the two-component PCA model accounts for 95.40% and 3.94% of the variation in PC1 and PC2 respectively. reference sample (RS) with a negative value on PC1 and the reference fingerprint (RFP) are situated very close to the origin, indicating the \u201csynthesized\u201d reference fingerprint (RFP) is very similar to an independently acquired reference sample. acceptable linearity was demonstrated for the three marker compounds in the concentration range suitable for sample analysis. the relative standard deviation (RSD) was not to exceed 0.62, 1.15 and 1.10% (n = 6) for MT, OMT and SPR, respectively. of MT, SPR, OMT and the total amount (SUM) were in S14. the lowest contents of MT,

91.9 -1.0 0.999 the two-component PCA model accounts for 95.40% and 3.94% of the variation in PC1 and PC2 respectively. the score scatter plot (B) shows that all the samples are grouped into two clusters marked by Group1 and Group 2, respectively. the samples in Group 1 (S1, S2, S15, S17, S19, S23, S24, S25, S26 and S27) all have negative values on PC1. the instrument precision was 6 replicated loading S1 sample solution to determine the average qualitative similarity (AQLS) of 0.963 (RSD = 3.5%) and the average quantitative similarity (AQTS) of 100.5% (RSD = 0.73%). the sample solution stability was analyzed once every 95 minutes after prepared within 11 hours. the method repeatability was assessed by analyzing six independently prepared samples (S1) by above analytical procedures to give AQLS of 0.976 (RSD = 0.75%) and b can exactly discriminate the samples from total contents of all fingerprint peaks. but actually r is disabled for the function. for example, S19 has lower linear quantitative similarity (76.5%). but the linear qualitative similarity (r) is very high (0.998) quantitative fingerprint analysis can provide a more accurate evaluation of the herbal samples. we can calculate the composition similarity of the three biggest peaks. peak16, peak13 and peak17 with 0.478, 0.458, 0.055 of r, and 36.9%, 35.8% and 12.6% of b. the total value of r for the tri-marker is 0.99 and the total value of b for the tri-marker is 85.3%. the method repeatability was assessed by analyzing six independently prepared samples (S1) by above analytical procedures to give AQLS of 0.978 (RSD = 1.75%) and AQTS of 100.2% (RSD = 1.31%) the above AQLS and AQTS were calculated out by the self-made TCM fingerprint software. the validation results exhibited that the method satisfied the fingerprint analysis criteria. the HPLC fingerprints of 27 batches of the ASF samples, the reference fingerprint (RFP) and the reference sample (RS) detected at 210 nm. in terms of the criteria, the qualities of S3, S4, S5, S7, S8, S11, S15, S18, S20, S22 and RS were best (Grade 1), those of S1, S10, S13, S16, S17, S21, S14, S26 and RS were better (Grade r is 0.99 and the total value of b for the tri-marker is 85.3%. the weight content of the ASF was accurately quantitated using the marker compounds (MT, OMT and SPR) but the quantitative analysis requires the reference standards, calibration and more time. in all the samples was averaged to generate its average content ( z) then the percentage of the ith marker content (Pi%) for 27 samples (seen in S1 Table) was calculated out using a mass coefficient f j = m R m j. the mean of Pi% values of the three marker compounds in each sample (P3C%) was calculated according to Eq 6. however, the correlation coefficient between Pi% and b is significantly higher (0.9884). this indicates the biggest error was not more than 3.5% for E1 = R% P3C%, E2 = b P3C% and E3 = b R%. there is no correlation between LQTS and LQLS of 29 profiles in Table 3. we can quantify all fingerprints by RCFP displayed in Fig 4B. each fingerprint peak area was divided by the reference peak area of MT, so the relative peak area in RCFP was obtained. RCFP can also cancel systematic differences in the different HPLC machines. about 0.97% of total saponin was obtained by a colorimetric method at 520 nm using vanillin-perchloric acid as the coloration system and oleanolic acid as the reference substance. about 0.69% of total amino acids was analyzed by visible spectrophotometry at 570 nm with ninhydrin as the developer and l-tyrosine as the reference substance. two more samples were identified as dissimilar (S17 belonged to Grade 2 and S19 belonged to Grade 4) based on different linear quantitative similarities. this demonstrates that LQPM can be used to reliably evaluate the quality of ASF samples."}
