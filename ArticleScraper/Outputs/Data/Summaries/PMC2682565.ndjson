{"summary": "RNAi is a form of posttranscriptional gene silencing mediated by short double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecule to yield double-stranded duplexes 21\u201325 nucleotides in length. in this process, the cellular complex Dicer cleaves a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecule to yield double-stranded duplexes 21\u201325 nucleotides in length. in this process, siRNAs targeting to the viral genes of polymerase 1 (PB1), polymerase 2 (PB2), polymerase A (PA), nucleocapsid protein (NP), non-structure proteins (NS1 and NS2), matrix proteins (M1 and M2) can potently inhibit replication of influenza A viruses [16], [23], [24], [25], [26], and therefore abrogated the further RNAi treatment. two siRNAs targeting the NP gene were included in the experiments as controls. the siRNA M-950 exhibited a good inhibition effect with dose dependent manner. another siRNA M-126 just slightly inhibited virus replication even at a concentration of 100 nM. lentivirus integration didn't influence virus replication. titers in shNP- and shM2-MDCK cell cultures were 2 to 10 folds lower than controls. siM2 exhibited a better inhibition effect, showing about 2-fold lower viral titer than siNP. siM2 inhibits M2 specific mRNA expression level (B)siNP inhibits NP specific mRNA expression level. stable shRNA-expressing cell lines were infected by H1N1. images were taken by using a fluorescence microscope under a 400 magnification. images were taken by using a fluorescence microscope under a 400 magnification. siM2 provided more potent anti-H5N1 Viral Effect than siNP. culture supernatant cultured in shM2-MDCK cells for 40 passages. each 10 passages, the culture supernatant was collected and tested by plaque reduction assay. no obvious larger size of plaque was found. lentiviruses expressing the shRNAs M2-950 or NP-1496 were constructed and transduced into MDCK cells to establish two stable cell lines, shM2-MDCK and shNP-MDCK. the cells were infected with H1N1 virus at a moi of 0.005 in 8 hrs post infection. the siM2 Abolished not only M2 mRNA but also siNP mRNA Accumulation in the Stable Cell Lines. mRNAs were extracted from the cells harvested at 1, 2, 4 and 24 hrs post-infection. the mRNA expression level is normalized by copy number of -Actin. NP protein expression was Suppressed in Virus Infected shM2-MDCK cells. EGFP fluorescence was detected in Mock MDCK, shNP-MDCK and shM2-MDCK but not in MDCK and shM2-MDCK cells. results were consistent with above viral mRNA results. the virus replication was significantly inhibited in shM2-MDCK cells at all time-points, but shNP-MDCK just offered a minor inhibition effect at early stage of the virus infection. siM2 could provide a more potent protection than siNP against H5N1 infection. siRNAs targeting to 6 conserved genes of influenza A virus confer effective long term inhibition against IAV replication. NP-1496 was the best since it can confer a more than 200-folds inhibition of H1N1 virus. NP-1496 exhibited similar inhibitory effect against IAV replication. a broad inhibition to H1N1 influenza virus abolished the accumulations of specific NP or PA mRNAs but also inhibited the accumulations of mRNAs for M, NS1, PB1, PB2 and PA or NP genes. a possible explanation is that some double stranded siRNAs may result in IFN responses or activate a RNA degradation pathway. siRNAs targeting M or NP gene of influenza A virus were designed by siRNA target designer version 1.51 from Promega. the siRNAs were reverse transfected to MDCK cells using LipofectamineTM RNAiMAX (Invitrogene, USA) 24 hours after infection, RNA were extracted from the cells and followed by real time RT-PCR. lentivirus cassettes were constructed by annealing two primers containing the 19-nt sense and reverse complementary targeting sequences with a 9-nucleotide loop -TTCAAGAGAGA- and flanking Mlu1 and Cla1 cloning sites. the sequences of the insertions were confirmed by DNA sequencing. the transduced MDCK was sub-cultured every 3\u20134 days for 4 weeks to get stable viral genome integration. the transduced MDCK was sub-cultured every 3\u20134 days for 4 weeks. serial 2-fold dilutions of virus samples were mixed with a 0.5% suspension of turkey erythrocytes. for plaque assay, serial 10-fold dilutions of virus sample were added into a monolayer of MDCK cells. after 1 hr incubation, the virus was removed and the cultures were overlaid with 1% semi solid agar-MEM. the reactions were performed at 95\u00b0C 10 mins, 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C 1 min, 60\u00b0C 1 min, 72\u00b0C 1 min, followed by melting curve analysis according to instrument documentation. all reactions were done in triplicates and the results were normalized by -action. shM2-MDCK cells in a T25 cm2 flask were infected with H5N1 virus. part of the supernatants was inoculated to shM2-MDCK for next passage of the virus culture. another part was subjected for plaque assay to determine if potential siRNA-resistant virus appeared. RNA was extracted from the cells and followed by real time RT-PCR. lentiviral vectors were constructed by annealing two primers containing the 19-nt sense and reverse complementary targeting sequences with a 9-nucleotide loop. dilutions in DMEM and 8 g polybrene (hexadimethrine bromide, Sigma) ml1 were analyzed with a flow cytometer. Titers of the virus stocks were routinely 107108 transduction units. transduced MDCK was sub-cultured every 3\u20134 days for 4 weeks. infected cells were harvested at 1, 2, 4 and 24 hr after infection. h1N1 or H5N1 virus infected MDCK, Mock MDCK, shNP-MDCK and shM2-MDCK were harvested at 1, 2, 4 and 24 hr. the reactions were performed at 95\u00b0C 10 mins, 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C 1 min, 60\u00b0C 1 min, 72\u00b0C 1 min, followed by melting curve analysis. all reactions were done in triplicates and the results were normalized by -action. shM2-MDCK cells in a T25 cm2 flask were infected with H5N1 virus. part of the supernatants was inoculated to shM2-MDCK. another part was subjected to plaque assay to determine if potential siRNA-resistant virus appeared."}
