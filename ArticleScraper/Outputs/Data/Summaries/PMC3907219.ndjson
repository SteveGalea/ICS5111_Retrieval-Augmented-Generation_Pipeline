{"summary": "a 1 programmed ribosomal frameshift (1 PRF) occurs when the ribosome slips backward by one nucleotide and recognizes a different set of codons. the presence of a downstream pseudoknot can significantly increase the probability of a 1 PRF occurring. programmed 1 ribosomal frameshifting was first studied in the context of viruses (13\u201318) where a 1 PRF causes the ribosome to bypass the normal termination codon. frameshift signals direct elongating ribosomes to premature termination codons, leading to degradation of the mRNA through the nonsense-mediated decay pathway. the mRNA structure is the key to understanding the physical underpinnings of 1 PRF. some studies using mutants of a single 1 PRF promoting mRNA pseudoknot found a correlation between disruption force and 1 PRF (10,25) whereas others using mutants of different 1 PRF promoting pseudoknots did not (26,27). basepair and 234 basepair handles with four-base sticky ends. overhangs are designed to be complementary to the flanking sequence of the RNA pseudoknot. annealing was performed in 33% formamide, 1 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 533 mM NaCl, 50 ng/L mRNA, 1:300 dilution RNasin Plus RNase Inhibitor (2500u; Prom polyclonal anti-digoxigenin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) was diluted to 20 g/mL in phosphate-buffer solution (137 mM NaCl, 8.1 mM Na2HPO4, 1.8 mM KH2PO4, 2.7 mM KCl) and incubated in the chamber for 30 min. sample chamber was filled with 20 L of diluted bead solution with 1:200 dilution RNasin and incubated for 20 min. all experiments had final conditions of Tris-Mg buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 20 mM MgCl2, 0.02% TWEEN-20) with GODCAT (37) oxygen scavenger (721 g/mL glucose oxidase, 144 g the structure was relaxed at 0 force for the specified time. data were fit with exponential decay functions as a visual guide. a pseudoknot incorporating the 5\u2032 portion of the sequence (green) is replaced by a pseudoknot (blue) incorporating the full sequence. CCR5 mRNA constructs Double-stranded DNA handles were generated by PCR, purified, digested with BtgI and BstXI enzymes. these were then excised from a 2% agarose gel to obtain 194 basepair and 234 basepair handles with four-base sticky ends. these were then ligated to single-stranded DNA oligos (invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD) creating overhangs of 47 533 mM NaCl, 50 ng/L mRNA, 1:300 dilution RNasin Plus RNase Inhibitor (2500u; Promega, Madison, WI), and 1.3 ng/L Handle 1 and Handle 2 with overhangs. polyclonal anti-digoxigenin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) was diluted to 20 g/mL in phosphate-buffer solution. the sample chamber was filled with 20 L of diluted bead solution with 1:200 dilution RNasin and incubated for 20 min. all data taken with 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 20 mM MgCl2, 0.02% TWEEN-20 were filtered to 20 kHz for analysis. the mRNA structure was relaxed at 0 force for the specified time. the distribution of the four conformations shown in Fig. 4 was measured. the red state is stable, but a pseudoknot incorporating the 5\u2032 portion of the sequence (green) is replaced by a pseudoknot incorporating the full sequence. single-stranded mRNA properties Contour length 0.26 nm per base, persistence length 12 nm, neglected enthalpic contributions. 136 total bases hybrid DNA/RNA in handles. individual dE/dx curves corresponding to each trace (colors) are overlaid on a log density plot (grayscale) showing all dE/dx data taken for the CCR5 mRNA under the same conditions. each trace is identified with a color type. our method (35,46) for calculating dE/dx works by measuring the fluctuations of the structure as it is held under harmonic constraint. the method can be used to reconstruct the complete energy landscape in cases where there are no irreversible transitions or instances where the rate at which the transition progresses exceeds the time resolution of the apparatus. new techniques derived from these methods (51) can be used to find the relative energy difference of the initial and final states for nonequilibrium or irreversible transitions. however, these methods typically require statistical analysis of a large sample of transition events. substeps in the disruption pathways are plotted in Fig. 8 a. each subdisruption is a point on a scatter plot, where the x axis is the amount of mRNA already released when the disruption starts and the y axis is the amount of additional mRNA released. the substeps are classified based on short-extension features in the energy landscape (Fig. 5), which reflects the fluctuations of the mRNA extension before major disruptions. the disruption pathway is determined by the initial conformation. the high-force green conformation was suppressed when blocking the first 20 bases (5\u2032 end) but not when blocking the last 20 bases (3\u2032 end) green represents a structure that does not incorporate the last 20 bases, such as Pseudoknot 2 or Pseudoknot 3 shown in Fig. 2, d or e. yellow was relatively rare and did not have adequate statistics for us to investigate its response to blocking. however, it shows high dE/dx values at partial extension. it is possible that yellow is either Pseudoknot 2 or Pseudoknot 3, both of which do not incorporate the full 97 bases. these three features make the blue conformation consistent with the Pseudoknot 1 structure in Fig. 2 a. hairpin 1 occupies the 5\u2032 end of the 1 PRF element, the side from which the ribosome approaches. the disruption pathway in optical trap experiments is closely related to the ribosome-driven disruption pathway. the different disruption pathways reflect different initial conformations. blue initially has low occupancy but becomes the dominant conformation after 30 s of relaxation time. red and yellow pathways vary slowly with refolding time. individual dE/dx curves corresponding to each trace (colors) are overlaid on a log density plot (grayscale) showing all dE/dx data taken for the CCR5 mRNA under the same conditions. each trace is identified with a color type. the method can be used to reconstruct the complete energy landscape in cases where there are no irreversible transitions or instances where the rate at which the transition progresses exceeds the time resolution of the apparatus. the system appears to occupy distinct quasi-equilibrium states before and after a large irreversible transition. duplex RNA or DNA typically unzips at 13 pN (43,52) although this depends on G-C content. the red conformation has the lowest measured force and dE/dx levels, usually 13 pN. a similar dE/dx signature is observed under reverse scans. we represent each subdisruption as a point on a scatter plot. the x axis is the amount of mRNA already released when the disruption starts. blue disruptions show a sequence of two disruptions (60.3 bases immediately followed by 29.8 bases) resulting in two points in the scatter plot. disruptions are classified based on short-extension features in the energy landscape. the subsequent chain of disruption substeps (Fig. 8) can be predicted based on fluctuations beforehand. green represents a structure that does not incorporate the last 20 bases. green represents a structure that does not incorporate the last 20 bases. it is possible that yellow is either Pseudoknot 2 or Pseudoknot 3. Fig. 10 shows the energy of the two hairpins as a function of the number of bases of free RNA. only the final stage of disruption is shown, representing hypothetical disruption pathways after 55 bases of free RNA have been released. blue conformation at 67 bases coincides with a local minimum for Hairpin 2, but is not compatible with Hairpin 1 where a local maximum occurs. osome approaches suggest the disruption pathway in optical trap experiments is closely related to the ribosome-driven disruption pathway. we compare the two hairpins from Fig. 2, b and c, and plot the free energy for disruption given by MFOLD (45). green initially has high occupancy, which decreases at approximately the same rate that blue increases, suggesting green is a folding intermediate of blue. the red and yellow pathways vary slowly with refolding time, suggesting they are long-lived alternate conformations."}
