{"summary": "development of drug-delivery systems (DDSs) involves improving drug solubility,1-4 activity,5,6 bioavailability,4,7-11 targeting12 and dosing regimen13 as well as reducing toxicity. despite considerable progress in developing advanced DDSs, efforts are urgently needed to develop a clinically adequate therapeutic delivery platform. EVs are membrane vesicles released from nearly all cell types in mammalian species. they display versatile physiological functions and are involved in the maintenance of homeostasis. EVs can be classified as exosomes, microvesicles (MVs) and apoptotic bodies. apoptotic bodies are significantly different from the other two types of EVs. they are small vesicles formed in cells that suffered from programmed cell death. incoming cargos are generated from the internalized plasma membrane and then sorted into diverse intracellular destinations. colombo et al. analyzed the function of ESCRT components in EVs biogenesis using RNA interference. the existence of ESCRT-independent mechanisms have been corroborated by Stuffers et al. exosomes are formed from multivesicular bodies (MVBs) during endosomal maturation. extracellular vesicles are secreted by fusion of MVBs with the cytomembrane. liposomes are constructed of phospholipids, similar to the plasma membrane. EVs are being widely studied as anti-tumor DDSs due to their passive targeting ability to tumor tissues via enhanced permeation and retention effect. EVs could be genetically engineered as targeted DDSs, offering a versatile platform for delivering drugs to specific targets. EVs encapsulated with doxorubicin and curcumin both effectively inhibit the progression and deterioration of colon and mammary cancer. these research results indicate that EVs have the capability to availably deliver chemotherapeutic drugs to suppress malignant tumors. growth in a rat model of primary brain tumor Katakowski75 exosomes miR-9 MSC glioblastoma multiforme Showed a potential role for MSCs in the functional delivery of synthetic anti-miR-9 to reverse the chemoresistance of GBM cells Munoz76 exosomes doxorubicin immature mouse dendritic cells breast cancer Caused less cardiac damage. sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling is critical for neovascularization and angiogenesis. the authors administered curcumin-primed EVs to a mouse model of LPS-induced hypertension and endothelial dysfunction. EVs originating from DCs loaded with toxoplasma gondii antigens induced protective immune reaction that inhibited toxoplasma gondii infection. EVs are promising candidate drug carriers for the delivery of therapeutics. EVs are superior biocompatibility with the lowest cytotoxicity, and more compatible with the host immune system than other nano-carriers. a zipcode-like 25-nt sequence promoted package miRNAs into EVs, demonstrating great potential for high-yielding EVs loaded with various RNAs.

EV levels of blood circulates may be associated with the onset and progression of disease severity. EVs also exhibit a cardioprotective effect on the myocardium from serious ischemia-reperfusion injury. s possess the ability to alleviate endothelial dysfunction in a hyperhomocysteinemia mouse model. sun et al. studied EVs as DDSs and found that EVs ensured the stability and concentration of curcumin during delivery. EVs can load with different drugs and maintain their nature biological properties during the encapsulation process for personalized medicine.

EV-mimetic nanovesicles can resemble natural viruses in morphology and immunogenicity. such nanovesicles have significant potential to deliver therapeutics with specific ligands on the surface for targeted drug delivery and therapy. medical experts are constantly seeking to develop novel DDSs and improve the targeting and bioavailability of drugs. the future of EV-based DDSs depends on cooperation among biologists, physicists, nanomaterial scientists and clinical specialists. the future of EV-based DDSs depends on cooperation among biologists, physicists, nanomaterial scientists and clinical specialists. mesenchymal stem cells MVBs multivesicular bodies MVs microvesicles NadA neisserial adhesin A NHBA neisserial heparin binding antigen NK natural killer (NK) cells OMVs outer membrane vesicles plexosomes plant-based exosomes RVG rabies viral glycoprotein SARS severe acute respiratory syndrome."}
