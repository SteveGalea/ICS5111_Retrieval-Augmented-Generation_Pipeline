{"summary": "the frequency of viral respiratory infections (VRIs) in asthma attack patients is now recognized as having a major impact on asthma pathogenesis in children. previous reports showed that respiratory tract infections associated with asthma exacerbation ranged from 10% to 21% to 45%. however, preliminary findings could not confirm the evidence of M. pneumoniae infection in those patients. asthma attack patients were enrolled in this study if they had acute or subacute episodes of progressively worsening shortness of breath, cough, wheezing, and chest tightness. exclusion criteria We excluded the patients who had chronic obstructive lung disease, pneumonia, interstitial lung diseases, acute heart failure, and respiratory symptoms. sputum samples were centrifuged at 3000 g at 41\u00b0C for 30 minutes. RNA extraction, (RT)-PCR, and gene sequencing of the pathogens Samples were centrifuged at 3000 g for 30 minutes. phylogenetic analysis of hMPV, RSV, and HRV was based on parts of the F gene (317 bp), G gene (240\u2013312 bp on RSV-A, 234\u2013 294 bp on RSV-B), and VP4/VP2 coding region (390 bp) the species of the viruses were estimated using the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) asthma attack patients were enrolled in this study if they had acute or subacute episodes of progressively worsening shortness of breath, cough, wheezing, and chest tightness. exclusion criteria We excluded the patients who had chronic obstructive lung disease, pneumonia, interstitial lung diseases, acute heart failure, and respiratory symptoms that were possibly due to infections in the last month. RNA extraction, (RT)-PCR, and gene sequencing of the pathogens Samples were centrifuged at 3000 g at 41\u00b0C for 30 minutes. PCR products were purified using MonoFas DNA Purification Kit I (GL Sciences Inc., Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan) phylogenetic analysis of hMPV, RSV, and HRV was based on parts of the F gene (317 bp), G gene (240\u2013312 bp on RSV-A, 234\u2013 294 bp on RSV-B), and VP4/VP2 coding region (390 bp) patients with virus alone (n = 39), virus and bacterial (n = 5) and bacterial alone (n = 5) were identified. the ratio of virus-positive patients in inpatient or outpatient to the total cases was 31.1% (n = 33) and 10.4% (n = 11), respectively. the proportion of smokers (7.7% vs 37.5%, P =.051) were not significantly different in virus-positive and negative inpatients. duration of respiratory failure (days), wheezes (days), steroid treatment (days) and hospital stays (days) did not differ significantly in virus-positive and negative inpatients. the incidence of bacterial coinfection (bacteria plus virus) was 11.4% (n = 5), and the ratio of bacterial alone group (n = 5) to the total 49 pathogen positive patients was 10.2%. no one had M. pneumoniae or C. pneumoniae infections. Phylogenetic tree based on hMPV F gene sequences. Figure 4. Phylogenetic tree based on hMPV gene sequences. a total of 106 asthma attack patients were examined. clinical characterization of inpatients with or without virus infection Of the 49 inpatients, 33 (67.3%) were virus positive (Table 2). the age and male to female ratio was comparable between virus-positive and virus-negative inpatients. the main HRV species were identified as HRV-A (n = 12) and HRV-C (n = 11), with only 1 HRV-B infection. the incidence of bacterial coinfection (bacteria plus virus) was 11.4% (n = 5), and the ratio of bacterial alone group (n = 5) to the total 49 pathogen positive patients was 10.2%. this trend was also found in the analyses of hMPV, Inf-V and RSV. phylogenetic tree based on hMPV VP4/VP2 gene sequences. hMPV was the most common cause of asthma attacks in autumn. the epidemiological data of HRV-A and HRV-C associated asthma attacks in adults were scarcely reported in Japan. however, the epidemiological data of HRV-A and HRV-B in hospitalized children younger than 5 years with acute respiratory illness were scarcely reported in the country. the present study reports the first evidence of VRIs in adults with a clear molecular epidemiology in a single-center cohort. the frequency of VRIs in asthma attacks seemed to be equal throughout the seasons."}
