{"summary": "despite humanitarian crises and troubling political divides, policymakers and researchers continue to pursue the imperative of improving quality and reducing disparities in health. the editorial presents the views of leading thinkers on five such topics: treatment of vulnerable trial participants, dissemination of data and research during outbreaks, strategies for high-burden infectious diseases. if the spread of Zika slows, such trials could also be the only way of testing a vaccine in humans. traditional research ethics has some answers to these questions. the answer to these questions will shape the conduct of clinical research in future disease outbreaks. epidemics of Ebola, Zika, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and chikungunya were all caused by unrelated viruses with different nonhuman hosts. the scale, speed, and diversity of these epidemics highlights the need for an equally scalable, rapid, and agile scientific response to address both short-term needs (e.g., identifying diagnostic tools or assessing disease severity) hepatitis C infects more than 180 million worldwide, with east Asia carrying over 30% of the burden. this year's Lasker-Debakey Clinical Medical Research Award gives the nod to the triumvirate who carried out a series of elegant fundamental experiments underpinning the development of anti-hepatitis C therapies. a third breakthrough in action research on access to medicines would need to be achieved. the future antigenic drift variants were found to cocirculate as a minor virus population years before they finally emerge as an epidemic strain. a joint team provided evidence to support the world health organization\u2019s 5-fold fractional-dose strategy for the Kinshasa vaccination campaign against yellow fever in the summer of 2016 [10] we must look at workforce diversity using a scientific lens, and second, insist that all our efforts are informed by data. we must accept the fact that science is a human endeavor that is affected by sociocultural factors. we need to engage the private sector and to focus on all environments where scientists make important contributions. people from all backgrounds are well-suited not only to careers in clinical, community, and implementation science but also to cutting-edge basic and applied research across all fields including neuroscience, basic-science discovery, and in leading the frontiers of research in medicine and surgery. the NIH made its first funding awards to support enrollment in the PMI Cohort Program. 45% of Asians and 77% of Pacific Islanders are ineffective for 45% of Asians and 77% of Pacific Islanders. the discovery of PCSK9 missense mutations in african americans with unusually low LDL cholesterol allowed for the development of a new class of drugs that have revolutionized cholesterol therapy regardless of race/ethnicity. racial and ethnic minorities remain grossly under-represented in clinical and biomedical research. the NIH and clinical and scientific communities need to be held accountable for increasing diversity in research. we should embrace diversity such that the rising tide of precision medicine lifts all boats, including groups disproportionately affected by disease. eds to match good intentions are potentially hindered by the politics of discrimination and exclusion. eds to match these good intentions are potentially hindered by the politics of discrimination and exclusion."}
