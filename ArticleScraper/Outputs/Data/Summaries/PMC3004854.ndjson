{"summary": "emergence of novel pathogens that threaten public health is unpredictable. the 2003 SARS epidemic is a paradigm that illustrates two essential requirements of biothreat preparedness. the threat of deliberate release of infectious agents in areas where they are not generally encountered further stress the need for rapid identification of unexpected agents. the number of sequences that one array is able to detect must be increased by optimization of the covered sequence space. however, both accuracy and sensitivity are expected to decrease with increasing levels of sequence mismatch between the microbial agent present in the sample. the aim of this study was to demonstrate and assess quantitatively, the advantage provided by using RASs on resequencing DNA microarrays. rpoB coding for the beta subunit of RNA polymerase makes evolution easier to model than 16S rRNA sequences. gene rpoB was sequenced in 169 taxonomic type strains of Enterobacteriaceae species and subspecies. for the purposes of this study, four ancestral nodes were selected at various phylogenetic depths. the most likely rpoB sequence of the ancestor of extant lineages that diversified from these four nodes was determined by a maximum likelihood method. enterobacter gergoviae was selected to compare results obtained with the tiled sequence of E. coli, its closest relative, with results obtained after hybridization on the RAS of the Citrobacter/Escherichia/Salmonella/Enterobacter (CESE) ancestor. for each of the seven hybridized strains, sequences were obtained from the 18 tiled rpoB sequences. yersiniaA, ancestral sequence of the Yersinia clade; PErwiniaA, ancestral sequence of the Pantoea/Erwinia clade; CESE, Citrobacter/Escherichia/Salmonella/Enterobacter clade; RootA, ancestral sequence of all Enterobacteriaceae. best call rate (52.8%) and accuracy (93.25%) values were obtained with the RAS of the CESE the RAS of all Enterobacteriaceae gave, by far, the best accuracy and call rate values compared to tiled sequences of extant Enterobacteriaceae members. it is remarkable that by using the Enterobacteriaceae RAS as tiled sequence, the accuracy jumped from 45% (maximal value obtained with extant Enterobacteriaceae members) to 73.7%. to quantify this beneficial effect of RASs, we reconstructed ancestral sequences at all nodes of the phylogeny obtained for 169 rpoB sequences. we then calculated the number of required RASs to achieve full coverage of extant sequences at divergence levels of 5, 10 and 15%. each extant sequence diverges by less than the chosen threshold from at least one ancestral sequence. gene rpoB was sequenced in 169 taxonomic type strains of Enterobacteriaceae species and subspecies. four ancestral nodes were selected at various phylogenetic depths. the most likely rpoB sequence of the ancestor of extant lineages diversified from these four nodes was determined by a maximum likelihood method. phylogeny of rpoB sequences used in this study. 169 rpoB sequences were used for inferring ancestral sequences. the ancestral node was represented with dotted lines connecting the Pantoea and Erwinia branches. the best values for call rate (82.2%) and accuracy (99.75%) were obtained with the tiled RAS corresponding to the ancestor of the Yersinia/Serratia clade. the values obtained with close relatives of Y. aldovae (Y. enterolitica and Y. pestis) were slightly lower. the accuracy value (81.52%) obtained with the RAS of the Serratia/Yersinia clade was slightly higher than that obtained with extant members of this clade. similar results were obtained when hybridizing M. wisconsensis and E. gergoviae. tiled sequences of some extant members of a clade are less divergent than the RAS of the clade. this is illustrated for eurella multocida: the tiled sequences of C. freundii, E. aerogenes and K. pneumoniae are closer from E. coli. reconstructed ancestral sequences at all nodes of the phylogeny obtained for 169 rpoB sequences. tant sequence with the highest coverage would cover 73 species. the single RAS with the best coverage would cover 108 species. the improvement provided by the use of RASs was more modest. the use of RASs would allow minimizing by approximately 25% the number of sequences that need to be tiled on the microarray to cover at 5% divergence. our results show that the use of RASs can broaden significantly the sequence space around the sequences tiled on a microarray. however, the accuracy of ancestral sequences is strongly affected by evolutionary phenomena such as homologous recombination. using ancestral sequences on microarrays broadens sequence space targeted by these tools and can therefore facilitate pathogen detection. the use of ancestral sequences should be regarded as an important strategy to improve the design of microarrays aimed at identification of pathogens of public health importance. the use of ancestral sequences should be regarded as an important strategy to improve the design of microarrays aimed at identification of pathogens of public health importance. reconstruction was based on 169 rpoB sequences of Enterobacteriaceae type strains. ancestral sequences were reconstructed by maximum likelihood using the software PAML v4. the microarray contains a minimum of 2.5 million of 25-mers probes. a set of 14 sequences corresponding to an internal sequence of gene rpoB were tiled on the array. these include the rpoB sequence of 12 members of the family Enterobacteriaceae: Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii. amplification was performed by Repli-g Mini Kit according to Qiagen's instructions. five micrograms of DNA were fragmented and labeled using the GeneChip Resequencing Assay Kit (Affymetrix Inc.), hybridized overnight at 45\u00b0C and washed, stained and scanned according to manufacturer's instructions. phylogeny used for ancestral sequences reconstruction was based on 169 rpoB sequences of Enterobacteriaceae type strains [26], [27], [28]. the phylogeny was based on 169 rpoB sequences of Enterobacteriaceae type
