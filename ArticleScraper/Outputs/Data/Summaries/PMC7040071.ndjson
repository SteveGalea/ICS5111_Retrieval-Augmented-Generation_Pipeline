{"summary": "pathogenic viruses can cause severe diseases and are threats to human health, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), influenza A virus (IAV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) to eradicate invading viruses quickly and efficiently, host has evolved highly conserved sensors, called pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) (1). PRRs, which include toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid-in the NLRP3 inflammasome is a multimeric platform of proteins that initiate inflammation. it plays an important role in both inflammation and antiviral responses. but the mechanisms of the NLRP3 inflammasome activation are still complicated and remain controversial. NLRP3 recruits ASC through its N-terminal pyrin domain (PYD) by homophilic interactions, resulting in the formation of ASC prion-like oligomerizes (8). the NAIP, CIITA, HET-E and TP1 domain in the middle of the NLRP3 possesses dNTPase activity and mediates downstream oligomerization (9). the NLRP3 inflammasome triggers the auto-cleavage of pro-caspase-1 (12, 13) caspase-1 mediates the proteolytic processing of pro-IL-1, pro-IL-18, and the propyroptotic factor gasdermin D (GSDMD) cytosolic RNA sensors detect viral RNA, such as VSV and IAV. TLR3, TLR7, and TLR9 participate in the sensing of IAV, HCV and adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylate (2\u20135A) synthetase (OAS) recognizes dsRNA from some viruses, such as IAV and VSV. DDX19A, another DExD/H-box RNA helicase family member, senses porcine reproductive and respiration syndrome virus (PRRSV) and promotes NLRP3 inflammasome activation (36). the NLRP3 inflammasome is usually associated with sensing cytosolic danger signals referred to as DAMPs. viruses cause a series of changes in cellular status of their host cells. the maturation and acidification of lysosomes lead to the leaking of catalytically active cathepsin B. potassium efflux is a well-known activator of the NLRP3 inflammasome. HCV infection induces potassium efflux in macrophages, thus leading to the maturation of pro-IL-1 (21) viroporins are small, highly hydrophobic proteins derived from viruses. cation-selective ion channel permits release of Na+/K+ to induce NLRP3 inflammasome activation (53\u201355) mitochondria damage also induces the production of ROS to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome (56, 57) the process of viral replication causes lytic cell death and subsequent potassium efflux. the PB1-F2 protein from IAV induces oxidative stress and the alteration of mitochondrial calcium, leading to apoptosis and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. measles virus, paramyxovirus, and influenza virus NS1 protein inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation by interacting with NLRP3. interaction between viral proteins and NLRP3 prevents self-oligomerization of NLRP3 as well as the recruitment of ASC. miR-BART15 targets the miR-223 binding site in the NLRP3 3\u2032-UTR to inhibit NLRP3 activation. mitochondrial location of PB1-F2 attenuates mitochondrial membrane potential. NLRP3 ubiquitination and protein degradation is a key regulatory mechanism for NLRP3 inflammasome activation. EV71 proteases 2A and 3C directly cleave NLRP3 protein at residues G493-L494 or Q225-G226, respectively. NLRP3 inflammasome activation and subsequent inflammation play significant roles in defending against viral infections. but aberrant NLRP3 inflammasome activation or chronic inflammation can lead to severe pathological injury. NLRP3 inflammasome activation is a double-edged sword for host to defense. author contributions CZ drafted the manuscript and figures. authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
