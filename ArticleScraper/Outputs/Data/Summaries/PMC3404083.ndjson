{"summary": "the pathogenesis of thrombocytopenia syndrome virus is poorly understood. it has been suggested immune mechanisms, including cytokines, play an important role in disease pathogenesis. the pathogenic mechanism in patients with SFTSV infection is at least partly immune-mediated. other viruses, such as Hantaviruses and Crimean\u2013Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, cause cytokine activation. an uncontrolled release of cytokines has been observed in filovirus infection. plasma samples were obtained from patients during acute phase of their illness. serum was extracted and immediately frozen at \u201380\u00b0C until serum analysis. serum samples from 40 healthy volunteers were also included as controls. results were analyzed using SPSS for Windows version 17.0. a suspected case was defined as one with acute fever, in which the pathogen could not be identified. a suspected case was defined as one with acute fever. serum samples from 40 healthy volunteers were also included as controls. serum levels of TNF-, TGF-, IL-6, IP-10, IFN- and RANTES were measured retrospectively by an ABC ELISA kit. median interval between onset of illness and day in which serum samples were obtained at admission was 5.5 days (range, 1\u201310 days) median length of hospital stay was 9.75.2 days (range, 1\u201322 days) six (15.0%) of 40 patients died of acute left ventricular failure, multiorgan dysfunction or aplastic anemia within 4\u201318 days of admission. all patients had thrombocytopenia, and elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. all patients had thrombocytopenia, and elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. serum levels of TNF-, TGF-, IL-6, IP-10, IFN- and RANTES were significantly higher in patients compared with those with non-severe SFTSV infection. levels of IFN- were significantly lower in patients than those in healthy individuals. levels of IFN- in severe cases were significantly lower (p0.001) than those in healthy individuals. levels of IP-10 in severe cases were significantly higher (p = 0.019) than those in healthy individuals. the difference in the lymphocyte subgroups was not statistically significant between severe and non-severe cases. 0.055 IFN- 236.4 (105.0\u20132216.1) 35.4 (0.3\u20131530.8) 0.001 64.0 (0.3\u20132216.1) 136.0 (18.8\u20131083.0) 0.008 RANTES 1144.8 (419.3\u20132785.7) 1618.2 (310.7\u20133231.9) 0.448 1464.0 (310.7\u20133231.9) 243.7 (11.1\u2013443.1) 0.001 Data are median, levels in pg/mL the pathogenesis of virus infection has not been clearly defined. inflammatory cytokines and chemokines play a role in the pathogenesis of virus infection in animals and humans. the most striking phenomenon was the significant increase in plasma TNF-, IL-6 and RANTES and the significant decrease in plasma IFN- in patients with SFTSV infection. IFN- and TNF- have a synergistic effect on endothelial cell cultures in vitro by increasing monolayer permeability. if the role of TNF- in SFTSV infection is the same as that in other viral hemorrhagic fevers is not known. levels of cytokines such as IL-6 and IFN- in the blood of infected patients are also associated with clinical outcome. the cause of the significantly lower levels of IFN- in non-severe cases with SFTSV infection is not yet known. IP-10 is a chemoattractant for recruiting natural killer and activated T cells into sites of tissue inflammation. levels of IP-10 in patients were similar to those in healthy individuals. reduced levels of IFN- in non-severe patients may be due to the inhibited expression of IFN- or production of IFN- antagonist during SFTSV infection. interaction between these cytokines has also been demonstrated. a positive correlation between IFN- and IP-10 levels has been observed in these patients. the levels of Th1 cytokines are correlated with disease severity. further immunological studies are required to elucidate the role of the immune response in patients\u2019 outcomes."}
