{"summary": "three main subtypes of swine influenza virus (H1N1, H3N2, and H1N2) have circulated in pigs worldwide. in march 2009, a new swine-origin H1N1 virus became a pandemic. pig infections with the new H1N1 virus have then been observed in multiple countries. co-infections of swine influenza virus and S. suis in pigs contribute to severe pneumonia. fewer studies have examined swine influenza and S. suis co-infection in pigs. pathogenesis is not yet fully elucidated. an SS2 strain, 05ZY, was isolated from the brain of a diseased piglet in Sichuan Province, china in 2005. the pigs were randomly divided into four groups with three pigs per group. each group was housed in an isolated room. the SS2 and SS2 groups were inoculated intranasally with 2 mL of 107.0 EID50/mL of the H1N1 swine influenza virus. the other pigs were inoculated with PBS containing 106.0 CFU/mL SS2 strain ZY05. all pigs were humanely euthanized by intravenous injection of sodium pentobarbital. bacterial and bacterial isolation At specified time points, the collected nasal swabs were inserted into vials containing 1.5 mL of sterile PBS supplemented with 100 U/mL penicillin and streptomycin. to prevent cross-contamination, separate sterile instruments were used to collect the lungs of pigs from each group. genes with significant similarities (greater than 70%) to transcripts in the nr database were then examined using hierarchical cluster (Ver. 3.0) and treeView (Ver. 1.1.1) analyses. all DE genes were identified by setting a fold change (FC) > 1.5 and p 0.05 as the criteria. RNA was reversely transcribed in a 20l reaction mixture. a value of P 0.05 was considered statistically significant. the study was approved by the Biological Studies Animal Care and Use Committee in Hubei Province, china. the two experiments were performed at the same time and under same conditions. each group was inoculated intranasally with 2 mL of 107.0 EID50/mL of the H1N1 swine influenza virus. the other pigs were inoculated with PBS. at least 6 sections per lung from each group were examined microscopically for tissue damage, necrosis, apoptosis, and inflammatory cellular infiltration. dal lobes were embedded in formalin and embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5m, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. the hybridization data were normalized using Agilent Feature Extraction software. all differentially expressed (DE) genes were then examined using hierarchical cluster (Ver. 3.0) and treeView (Ver. 1.1.1) analyses. the raw and processed data in this study have been deposited in NCBI\u2019s Gene expression omnibus. t-tests were used to compare virus titers, gene expressions, lung pathological damage score, and the apoptosis rate among infection groups. ized on day 6 and the macroscopic lesions of lungs tissues were estimated visually. more serious lung pathological damage was caused by co-infection, including hyperemia, necrosis, bleeding, and consolidation, compared with separate infections. pigs were PBS-control infected with H1N1, SS2 and H1N1-SS2. on day 6 of the experiment, lungs were removed and underwent Hematoxylin and eosin stain. the microscopic lesions of lung tissues from each group showed different extent of acute pneumonia. swabs were collected from the right nostrils of pigs every other day. supernatants were collected and viruses were qualified as LgEID50. at the day 6 of the experiment, all pigs were humanely euthanized. inflammatory response and apoptosis were more intensely activated in the H1N1-SS2 group compared with the H1N1 and SS2 groups. more DE genes were clustered in the immune and inflammation response (cytokine\u2013cytokine receptor interaction, MAPK signaling, Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling, JAK-STAT signaling pathway, antigen processing and presentation) -infection significantly regulated the mRNA expression of several chemokine and chemokine receptor genes, including CCL3 (1.62-fold), CX3CL1 (1.7-fold), CXCL16 (0.56-fold), CCR1 (2.23-fold), and CXCR4 (1.55-fold) the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF- was not significantly regulated, but five tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily genes were significantly regulated. skeletal muscle GEM 404772 -1.63 CD4 molecule CD4 404704 1.58 toll-like receptor 6 TLR6 396621 1.58 Inflammatory response sphingosine-1-phosphate

high fever (41.5\u00b0C, 41.8\u00b0C, and 41.5\u00b0C) all groups except the control exhibited different degrees of pathological damage. extensive lung damages were observed in H1N1-SS2 group.

cytokine TNF- was not significantly regulated, five tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily genes were significantly regulated in the co-infection group.

LBP catalyzes the transfer of LPS to CD14, which then mediates the transfer of LPS to the membrane, where LPS binds with the TLR4-MD-2 complex. the role of TLR4 and its downstream signaling in co-infection are worthy of further investigations. cytokine is an important part of the host defensive system that helps eliminate pathogens by recruiting inflammatory cells. however, overabundant cytokine production could cause pathology. signaling pathway has been found to be greatly induced. it may suggest that the significant activation of the MAPK pathway plays some important roles in the pro-inflammatory responses caused by co-infection. CD163 was significantly upregulated in the SS2 and H1N1-SS2 infection groups. the PPAR pathway has an important role in anti-inflammatory response. it can reduce several pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. this result indicated that the host tried to terminate over-induced inflammatory responses. in the present study, several genes, as immune cell markers, were moderately upregulated, which contained CD14, CD1D, and CD163 in the SS2 and H1N1-SS2 groups. however, CD163 and CD1D were both downregulated, and CD14 was not significantly changed in H1N1 group. more genes related to complement system were upregulated, including C1R, C1S, C5AR1, C6 and KNG1. apoptosis was observed in the lungs from all infection groups. increased robust apoptosis was induced by the H1N1-SS2 co-infection. co-infection led to much higher apoptosis rate compared with separate infections. co-infection by H1N1 and SS2 could potentiate virulence by causing severe apoptosis. co-infections of influenza virus and SS2 are highly complex, which makes the mechanism of the increased virulence much complex. factors contributing to the complex may include infection doses of pathogens, the secondary infection time, different pathogens with various virulence, and even environment factors. the results showed that MYD88 was significantly upregulated in the H1N1-SS2 group at 2.32-fold compared with that in the other two infection groups. however, the role of TLR4 and its downstream signaling in co-infection are worthy of further investigations. MYD88, NFKB1, TIRAP, TLR4 and TLR9 were upregulated from 1.63- to 2.32-fold in this group. these genes are all involved in the TLR signaling pathway. MAPK, a key pathway that regulates the synthesis of numerous cytokines, chemokines, and other inflammatory mediators, was also significantly regulated. CYBB is related to lung inflammation caused by influenza virus. the increased NADPH oxidase expression implied more ROS production and would lead to oxidative stress, which caused more severe inflammatory damage in H1N1-SS2 group. NK cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and neutrophils increased upon influenza virus infection. the increase of the immune cells is not only beneficial for clearing the virus, but may also contribute to pulmonary inflammation. LGMN, a cysteine protease, was reported to be implicated in human regulatory T cell function [52] NK cells play an important role in the immune response to viral infections, which can activate dendritic cells and also secret T helper type 1 (Th1) cytokines to augment cytotoxic T cell responses. apoptosis was observed in the lungs from all infection groups. increased robust apoptosis was induced by the H1N1-SS2 co-infection. the microarray analysis results also indicated that more genes involved in apoptosis pathway were regulated. the H1N1 infection with 107.0 EID50/mL could cause flu symptoms within 3 days. SS2 challenge with 106.0 CFU/mL could lead to severe typical symptoms within 24 hours. many genes reported to play important roles in inflammatory response were not fund to be significantly changed. Lungs were removed on day 6 and were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5m, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for further histopathologic evaluation. (1.1MB, tif) S5 Data.
