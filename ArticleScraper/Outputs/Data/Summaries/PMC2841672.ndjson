{"summary": "study aimed to measure perceptions and responses of staff and students towards pandemic. students were more likely to be infected if unwell compared with staff members. students were more likely to attend the university. as of february 12 2010, there have been 37,000 confirmed cases and 191 deaths in australia. the median age of confirmed cases is 21 years. university settings are unique given the permeability of their boundaries and the activities within the institution that affect social contact. survey data was collected from the 29 June - 30 September, coinciding with the peak of the pandemic in Australia. anonymous online survey was designed to assess knowledge, attitudes and perceptions of pandemic (H1N1) 2009. participants accessed the final questionnaire via a link on an online newsletter. emails were sent to the heads of each Faculty, informing them of the survey. Submitted surveys were collated in a directory and de-identified prior to analysis. anonymous online survey was designed to assess knowledge, attitudes and perceptions of pandemic (H1N1) 2009, which was referred to by its vernacular alternative, \"swine flu\" the final version assessed: demographic characteristics; (2) awareness, perceived personal risk and anxiety; (3) recent influenza-related behaviours changes; (4) intended behaviour in the event of various scenarios at UNSW. total of 2882 UNSW staff and students aged 18 years completed the online survey between the 29 June and 30 September 2009. the overall response rate was 5.7% (2882/50847) and most respondents were young (18-34 years, 73.9%, 2129/2882) and born in Australia (51.8%, 1492/2882) 80 (22.2) 150 (23.2) 38 (2.0) 268 (9.3) 55-64 57 (15.8) 84 (13.0) 11 (0.6) 152 (5.3) 65 13 (3.6) 2 (0.3) 1 (0.1) 16 (0.6) Not specified 0 (0.0) 3 (0.5) 5 (0.3) 8 (0.3) Home/living arrangements Live alone 41 (11.4) 97 (15.0) 116 (6.2) 254 (8.8) Live with parents 25 (6.9) 71 (11.0 60.4% believed that it was serious, 40.4% said that they were \"not anxious\" and a further 23.8% (686/2882) reported \"disinterest\" of respondents who felt they were likely to contract pandemic influenza. respondents aged over 55 were most likely to be anxious (OR, 2.28 [95% CI, 1.00-4.68]; p = 0.02) and younger respondents aged 20-34 were the least likely group to believe they were susceptible to infection. most respondents (75.9%, 2188/2882) had not made any lifestyle changes and 61.8% (1781/2882) had not undertaken specific health behaviours due to the pandemic. n = 360 (%) n = 646 (%) n = 1876 (%) n = 2882 (%) Have you made changes to the way you live your life because of \"swine flu\" I have cancelled travel plans-interstate or international 22 (6.1) 26 (4.0) 170 (9.1) 218 (7.6) I have stopped using public transport 13 (3.6) 102 (15.8) 134 (7.1) 295 (10.2) compliance with specific public health measures 60.2% (1736/2882, p 0.001) of respondents were willing to comply with all five public health measures if requested by authorities.
