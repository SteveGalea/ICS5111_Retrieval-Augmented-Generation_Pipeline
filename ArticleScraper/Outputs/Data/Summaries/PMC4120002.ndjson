{"summary": "exercises provide an opportunity for multiple sectors to practice, test and evaluate their response to all types of public health emergencies. the information from these exercises can be used to refine and improve preparedness plans. there is much less information about the use of exercises among public health agencies in other countries. exercises have explored a wide range of topics from foodborne toxoplasmosis outbreaks [3], chemical disasters [4], acute blood shortages [5], bioterrorism [6], and severe acute respiratory syndrome [7]. a large number of these exercises have been focused on the spread of infectious diseases especially the threat of pandemic influenza because the common challenges pandemic influenza shares with other types of public health emergencies [12-16]. countries in three different geographic regions participated in the exercises. the exercises were part of sub-regional disease surveillance networks established in part through funding from the Rockefeller Foundation. exercise facilitators were all health officials or health researchers who were trained in the facilitation of exercises. participants were asked to make concrete decisions for the topic area being discussed before moving on. six of the exercises were rated for their quality through five Likert scale questions. results and discussion We developed and conducted 12 exercises from august 2006 through December 2008. participants from the health sector were represented in every exercise. the most commonly represented sectors other than health were agriculture and defense. health, civil defense, environment, police, public works, religious, education, social development, agriculture, youth, water Jordan National 9-10 Apr 2008 15.5 55 (5) Health, agriculture, water and irrigation, energy, labor, finance, municipal and rural affairs, industry and trade, religious, education, justice, interior, transportation, immigration, security, tourism, information and culture. participants who completed these evaluation forms consistently rated the overall quality of the exercises as high (88-100% rating the exercise as good or excellent) with one exception (M participants consistently rated the exercises highly for helping them understand the roles and responsibilities of organizations and agencies responding to an influenza pandemic. participants rated the exercises lowest on their ability to identify key gaps in performance (50%-73% agreeing or strongly agreeing the exercises identified important key gaps) there are a variety of factors that could explain this result. participants left the exercises with specific ideas about the most important follow-up actions that they should take in the near future. participants identified better planning, improved planning coordination across sectors and countries. participants also provided feedback on the use of tabletop exercises for pandemic influenza preparedness. responsible parties Significantly revise and improve existing plans Better training of all health workers Improve public awareness of the threat Continue to meet regularly and assess improvements Encourage more collaboration between animal and human health personnel. research has called into question the ability of exercises to adequately expose operational and logistical gaps. despite these flaws, exercises show great promise as tools to build relationships, assess performance and improve collaborative planning for public health threats across multiple sectors and multiple countries. and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."}
