{"summary": "the concept of a viral role in Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) was first proposed several decades ago. it depended on a positive answer to a number of test questions, the first of which was whether or not HSV1 is ever present in human brain. the subsequent discovery that HSV1 DNA resides in a high proportion of brains of elderly people. active HSV1 infection causes severe damage and usually leads to cell death. reactivation events have long been known to occur in the peripheral nervous system. they cause overt damage in the form of cold sores (herpes labialis) in some 20\u201340% of those infected. APOE-e4 is a risk factor, paralleling its proposed role as a risk for AD in the CNS. reactivation of HSV1 in brain obviously does not lead to overt herpes simplex encephalitis. reactivation events must presumably be very localized or mild. many studies have been published using diverse approaches and yielding diverse types of information, all of which explicitly support, or are consistent with, the proposed role for HSV1 in AD. despite the preponderance of supportive data, the concept of a viral role in the disease is still regarded by some as controversial. the likelihood that an asymptomatic person would be classed as a \u201ccontrol\u201d does not necessarily mean \u201caffect\u201d in some diseases. some researchers invoke the first of Koch\u2019s postulates, that the microorganism must be found in abundance in all organisms suffering from the disease. the author\u2019s study sought CMV DNA by PCR, and detected it in 36% of AD brains and 35% of age-matched controls. however, it was stressed that the value might be artefactually high, as no account could be taken of virus residing in lymphocytes rather than in brain cells. the most comprehensive early study (Renvoize et al., 1987) gave negative results for adenovirus, chlamydia Group B, Coxiella burnettii, HSV, influenza A, influenza B, measles and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. a more recent study, with presumably greater sensitivity, found that viral burden was associated with cognitive impairment among home-dwelling elderly individuals with vascular disease. study by Tarter et al. (2014) examined CMV and HSV1 seropositivity over a range of age groups in the general population. they found that HSV1 seropositivity in children was associated with impaired cognition, in the middle-aged with impaired reading and visuospatial processing and slower coding speed. they therefore suggested that HSV1 might have a life-course effect on cognition, while CMV effects might be restricted just to the middle-aged. a study of 1454 multiethnic subjects aged 25\u201391 showed that high antibody titres to HSV1 were significantly associated with both CMV seropositivity and with high CMV antibody levels. also, increases in HSV1 antibody level with age occurred in CMV-seropositive people. authors suggest that HSV1 reactivation is associated with CMV and age. the first study on anti-HSV IgM, by Letenneur et al. (2008), revealed that elderly subjects who were IgM-positive were far more likely to develop dementia within the following 14 years than those who were IgG- but not IgG-positive. however, the authors concluded that their data supported the involvement of virus reactivations leading to alterations in APP processing, and eventually to AD. a longitudinal prospective cohort study investigated a possible relationship between HSV infection and AD by examining serum anti-HSV antibodies. the study was particularly strong in that the design was prospective, the number of participants large, the follow-up duration lengthy, and the diagnostic evaluations numerous. the authors took AI as an indicator of HSV1 reactivation. the anti-HSV1 IgG AI and IgG antibody titre differed between the controls and the aMCI groups. the apparently lower reactivation rate in AD might be explained by the occurrence of structural and functional changes in brain caused by HSV1 (or other agents/factors), at some time before the onset of confirmed AD. authors suggested that these genes might code for proteins that interact in various processes, thus leading to a synergistic effect on AD pathogenesis. they suggested that these genes might code for proteins that interact in various processes, thus leading to a synergistic effect on AD pathogenesis. the author stressed the point that the seroprevalence of HSV1 is much greater than that of the disease. he conceded that host and microbial genetics play a key role in determining outcome of infection. he said even though antiviral drugs and vaccination might affect the incidence of many diseases, host/pathogen protein mimicry suggests that the effects of treatments might be affected by autoimmune features. a pre-PCR study on HSV1 in post mortem human brain specimens strongly suggested that HSV1 reactivates there under conditions such as immunosuppression. a review of multiple sclerosis patients treated with natalizumab revealed that between November 2004 and December 2012, 20 cases developed HSE. study examined the CNS and trigeminal ganglia of HSV1-infected mice for several markers of inflammation and neurodegeneration. they detected viral ICP4 protein during the acute, symptomatic phase of infection at 7 days but also at 60 days post-infection, thus indicating that reactivation was occurring. authors concluded that their data support the hypothesis that HSV1in brain reactivates recurrently, thereby promoting neuroinflammation by triggering TLRs the viral load in brain was maximal during the acute phase, declined during adulthood and then increased with ageing. in wild-type female mice the load was 43 times greater than in apoE-K/O animals. infection caused a memory deficit and reduced a metabolic measure of neuronal health. a novel study by Krut et al. (2013) compared CSF biomarker profiles of AD with various CNS infections, including HSE. values for AD and HSE, in contrast to the other infections, showed a markedly similar pattern in all but one respect. work from several laboratories shows that HSV1 infection of cultured cells causes a marked accumulation of intracellular A and P-tau. also, A deposits are formed in the brains of HSV1-infected mice. these increases were explained by increases in the relevant enzymes. results obtained using GFP-tagged virus showed that APP and HSV1 co-localize and travel together within cells and that the distribution of APP is abnormal in HSV1-infected cells. the most commonly used antiviral agent, acyclovir (ACV), is very effective and very safe. penciclovir and foscarnet did reduce A and P-tau accumulation (as well as HSV1 as expected), in infected Vero cell cultures. but with all three antivirals, P-tau accumulation was found to depend on HSV1 DNA replication, whereas A accumulation was not. antivirals that act on HSV1 at an infection stage before viral DNA replication might be more effective in treating AD. IVIG was effective at reducing accumulation of A and P-tau, in infected Vero cell cultures. it acts synergistically with ACV, suggesting it would be beneficial for treating AD. a double-blind placebo-controlled trial assessed the effects of VCV on cognitive performance and psychopathology. of 24 HSV1-seropositive patients aged 18\u201350 years, 12 were given 2 1.5 g VCV twice daily and 12 given placebo for 18 weeks. the authors pointed out that although there is no proven causal association of HSV1 with schizophrenia, their data indicate an association of the virus with cognitive impairments. memantine reduced the effects in mice of infection with a human neurovirulent coronavirus which causes encephalitis, and a mutant of which induces a paralytic disease involving glutamate excitotoxicity. they therefore proposed the use of memantine to treat certain neurological diseases of possible viral cause, such as AD."}
