{"summary": "BACKGROUND To develop the first international instrument to measure fertility quality of life (FertiQoL) in men and women experiencing fertility problems. a total of 1414 people with fertility problems participated. the main outcome measure was the FertiQoL tool. the 14 existing self-report measures of infertility-specific distress, treatment reactions and QoL shown in Supplementary data, Table S1 do not fulfill the need for a fertility specific QoL assessment tool. the fertility problem inventory (FPI: Newton et al., 1999) is the most frequently used distress measure. the need for a quality of life measure for infertility measure has not been fully met. the European Society of human reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) and the American Society of Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) joined forces with Merck-Serono S.A. Geneva-Switzerland to create the fertility quality of life measure (2002\u20132009) the overall aim of the project was to develop an international instrument to measure QoL in men and women experiencing fertility problems. material The Background Information Form covered socio-demographic status (e.g. age, education), medical history (e.g. current illness) and fertility-related characteristics (e.g. duration of infertility) the items were designed to translate abstract concepts into quantitative items that could collectively indicate the impact of fertility problems on QoL. patients, gynecologists, nurses, clinicians in 11 countries: Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, USA Treatment evaluation tools QoL measures WHO development manual Classification and reduction of item pool to eliminate redundant or irrelevant items. 102 Core FertiQoL + 27 optional treatment items Final Core FertiQol pool for psychometric phase was 102 items + 27 optional treatment items Additional items inquired about clarity, coverage and problems with item pool FertiQoL well accepted, perceived to be important and timely Material translated by experts Items easy to understand and relevant FertiQoL completing 15\u201320 min Main problems: items that did not apply to all people (e.g. single or untreated) and timeframe for ' data were screened and duplicate internet protocol addresses were eliminated unless of different gender and response pattern. descriptive statistics and correlations were used to identify the best items for each a priori domain of QoL. items with factor loadings less than 0.30 and eigenvalues less than one were eliminated. the online sample consisted of 291 women and 75 men. the online sample consisted of 1014 women and 34 men. the internal review board of each clinic approved the clinic studies. researchers, psychologists, social workers, counselors, patients, gynecologists, nurses, clinicians in 11 countries. experts included: researchers, psychologists, social workers, counselors, patients, gynecologists, nurses, clinicians in 11 countries. n = 525 men and women in 10 countries. 102 Core FertiQoL + 27 optional treatment items Final Core FertiQol pool for psychometric phase was 102 items + 27 optional treatment items Additional items inquired about clarity, coverage and problems with item pool FertiQoL well accepted, perceived to be important and timely Material translated by experts. aFocus groups in Singapore cancelled due to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus. data were screened and duplicate internet protocol addresses were eliminated unless of different gender and response pattern. descriptive statistics and correlations were used to identify the best items for each a priori domain of QoL. items with factor loadings less than 0.30 were eliminated. the Online sample was more likely to have at least one child, a shorter duration of infertility but less likely to have other health problems. the Clinic sample was more likely to have at least one child, a shorter duration of infertility. same-sex 1.6 (13) 3.3 (9) Age-related 4.1

FertiQoL is available in 20 languages with more translations in progress. it is expected that FertiQoL will significantly contribute to future research and clinical endeavors aimed at investigating and ultimately improving QoL in people with fertility problems. FertiQol can be used to identify people at risk of impaired QoL. the availability of FertiQoL in 20 languages will facilitate cross-cultural research. large, multi-centered study showed a strong association between patient-centered care and favorable FertiQoL scores. but the sensitivity of Treatment FertiQoL needs to be investigated in clinical trials of new interventions. the aim of the FertiQoL project was to develop an instrument to measure QoL in men and women experiencing fertility problems."}
