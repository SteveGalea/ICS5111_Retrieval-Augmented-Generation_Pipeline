{"summary": "the transmission tree, phylogenetic tree, and within-host dynamics are not observed. from these data we simultaneously estimate both the transmission tree and the phylogenetic tree. the transmission times could be observed or unknown, in which case we estimate them simultaneously. we can further simplify this equation by using conditional dependencies. if we know the full transmission tree, epidemiological parameters, and within-host dynamics, the phylogenetic tree gives no further information on the probability of the epidemiological data: p ( D E | T,, W, P, ) = p ( D E | T,, W, ) p ( D E | T,, W, ) p ( D E | T,, W, ) the first term on the right-hand side is up to the inclusion of the within-host model W, identical to the likelihood equations found in many phylodynamic approaches. the second and third terms together resemble the likelihood equations found in many phylodynamic approaches. using simulated data sets, we apply it to simulated data on an influenza outbreak in a confined school-based population of 200 individuals. each simulation starts with 1 infected and 199 susceptible individuals, half of them children; only outbreaks with at least 50 cases were used for further analysis. we take a substitution rate of 0.003 substitutions/site/year. for each case, we record the time of symptom onset, the recovery time, a sequence sampled 1 day after symptom onset, and whether the case is a child or adult. to this end, we need to specify the three components of the likelihood. the infectiousness does not depend on the infected host, as we assume homogeneous mixing. the likelihood of the phylogenetic tree can be obtained from coalescent theory. we omit the Jukes\u2013Cantor correction because timescales are very short and selection pressures absent. the probability of multiple mutations at the same locus is negligible. to assess robustness of the estimation procedure, we simulate data, estimate parameters and evaluate performance for seven different simulation scenarios. in the baseline scenario, all data are available. in a fourth scenario, we examine the impact of unobserved hosts by randomly discarding 20% of infected hosts. phylogenetic tree, and within-host dynamics We focus on outbreaks for which nearly all cases are observed, host characteristics such as time of symptom onset are known. from these data we simultaneously estimate both the transmission tree and the phylogenetic tree. p ( D E | D E, T,, W, P, ) p ( D G | D E, T,, W, P, ) p ( P | T,, W, ) p ( P | T,, W, ) p ( P | T,, W ) p ( P | T,, W ) p ( P | T,, W ) p ( P | T,, W ) the first term on the right-hand side is up to the inclusion of the within-host model W, identical to the likelihood equations found in many phylodynamic approaches. the second and third terms together resemble the likelihood equations found in many phylodynamic approaches. simulated data on an influenza outbreak in a confined school-based population of 200 individuals are amenable to analysis. each simulation starts with 1 infected and 199 susceptible individuals, half of them children. only outbreaks with at least 50 cases were used for further analysis. we take a substitution rate of 0.003 substitutions/site/year (Jenkins et al. 2002) for each case, we record the time of symptom onset, the recovery time, a sequence sampled 1 day after symptom onset, and whether the case is a child or adult. the likelihood of the phylogenetic tree can be obtained from coalescent theory for haploid organisms. the number can decrease by one due to a coalescent event. the second case is described by the likelihood that the lineages did not coalesce for a time. we take the simplest feasible substitution model; all mutations are equally likely and happen with rate. we omit the Jukes\u2013Cantor correction because timescales are very short and selection pressures absent. probability of multiple mutations at the same locus is negligible. tx and ox are the start of the infection and the start of the infectious period (respectively) of host x, v(x) is the infector of host x, and it(a|, DE) is the infectiousness of host a at time t. the indicator function 1 coal is 1 if the interval starts with a coalescent, 0 otherwise. we take the simplest feasible substitution model. all mutations are equally likely and happen with rate. phylogenetic tree can be considered a nuisance parameter. to assess robustness of the estimation procedure, we simulate data, estimate parameters and evaluate performance for seven different simulation scenarios. both the phylogenetic tree and transmission tree have been estimated before for this outbreak separately, giving inconsistent results. we assume an exponentially increasing function for W as at time of culling the disease is still spreading within the farms. 0% (pink) of infected hosts have been sampled. only a few infectors can be identified at a high probability level. fewer infectors are identified correctly and incorrect inferences are made even at high probability levels. estimates are accurate when all information is available (gray) and when 50% of hosts are sampled (blue) assuming that coalescent events coincide with transmission events, however, leads to a large overestimation. the total branch length of the phylogenetic tree is underestimated. typical sample from the MCMC consisting of a transmission chain connecting the infected farms and a phylogenetic tree connecting the sampled sequences. the mean latency period was estimated at 7.8 (95% credibility interval, CI: 4.9, 12) days (Figure 4), which is in agreement with a typical latency period of 5 days (95% CI: 1\u201312 days) of FMD virus. the estimate (solid black) is higher than we would expect from the literature (blue) the overestimation could be due to unobserved infected farms. not allowing for within-host genetic diversity gives an overestimation. analysis for RNA viruses or bacteria might still be feasible if the times between infection are large enough, as sufficient genetic diversity might still accumulate over the course of the outbreak. a misspecification of the within-host effective pathogen population size is minor. however, the impact of a misspecification of the within-host effective pathogen population size is minor. transmission tree reconstruction methods focus on individual transmission events. many published phylodynamical approaches typically focus on finding general characteristics of an outbreak, e.g., epidemiological parameters, from sampled sequences."}
