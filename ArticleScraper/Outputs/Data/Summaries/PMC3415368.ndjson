{"summary": "1,2-bis-(4,4-difluoro-5,7-dimethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-undecanoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine was obtained from Molecular Probes (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) the animals were free of rat coronavirus and internal and external parasites at the time of study. the rats were fed a control diet supplemented with 0, 100, or 300 mg GE/kg daily for 3 wk. at the end of this period, the rats were weighed, divided randomly into 2 groups, and injected intraperitoneally with either 3 or 15 mg/kg LPS. blood samples were collected from the rats on day 0 (preLPS baseline) and then on days 1 through 5 after LPS injection; body weights were recorded prior to each blood collection. idylglycerol (2 mg) were mixed together in chloroform. the chloroform was evaporated off, and the free phospholipids were dissolved in 1 mL 100% ethanol to form the stock substrate solution. the stock solution was stored at 20 \u00b0C, and was stable for at least 1 mo. the health status of the rats after the LPS injection was assessed by a veterinarian or veterinary staff who were blinded to the diet and LPS dose that the animals received. a repeated-measures ANOVA model, which included factors of time, LPS dose, and diet group, was fit for each measured parameter by using the proc mixed function. the rats were free of rat coronavirus and internal and external parasites at the time of study. a total of 36 rats were fed a powdered control diet (65 g/d; 8728C Teklad Certified Rodent Diet, Harlan) for a week prior to their use. the rats were weighed, divided randomly into 2 groups, and injected intraperitoneally with either 3 or 15 mg/kg LPS (diluted in 1 mL sterile water) blood samples were collected from the rats on day 0 (preLPS baseline) and then on days 1 through 5 after LPS injection; body weights were recorded prior to each blood collection. the reaction mixture contained 10 L stock substrate\u2014ethanol solution (20 g phospholipids) and 3.3 L serum in a final volume of 1 mL assay buffer. the mixture was vortexed, and aliquots were transferred promptly in triplicate to a white polystyrene 96-well microplate. the fluorescence intensity in each well was recorded every 10 s for 60 cycles at 488 nm excitation (excitation slit, 2.5 nm) a repeated-measures ANOVA model was fit for each measured parameter. the correlations between observations taken on the same rat over time were modeled by using a compound symmetry correlation structure. for each measured marker, the model was fit by using the untransformed data. supplementation of the diet with 300 mg/kg GE daily inhibited the increases in sPLA2 activity induced by 3 mg/kg LPS. in the rats given 15 mg/kg LPS, both 100 (P 0.05) and 300 (P 0.001) mg/kg GE daily had no effect. dose of LPS produced 50% greater loss in body weight than lower dose. supplementation of the control diet with GE did not significantly affect changes in body weight induced by the higher dose of LPS. hematocrit changes after intraperitoneal administration of (A) 3 mg/kg LPS and (B) 15 mg/kg LPS to rats (n = 6 per diet) fed a control diet and or the control diet supplemented with 100 or 300 mg/kg GE daily. significant difference between values for control group and each GE-supplemented group at a particular time point. administration of LPS induced a marked increase (70% to 90% above baseline) in serum sPLA2 activity in the control diet-fed rats (Figure 1) on days 1 and 2 after LPS injection. on day 1, serum sPLA2 activity was approximately 30% greater (P 0.05) in rats that received the higher dose. administration of LPS to control-fed rats resulted in loss of body weight. higher dose of LPS produced 50% greater loss in body weight than did the lower dose. changes in body weight after intraperitoneal administration of (A) 3 mg/kg LPS and (B) 15 mg/kg LPS to rats (n = 6 per diet) fed a control diet and or the control diet supplemented with 100 or 300 mg/kg GE daily. significant difference when compared with value for day 0 within same group. administration of LPS produced significantly (P 0.001) increased serum CRP levels in the control diet-fed rats on day 2. there was no significant difference between the effects of the 2 LPS doses on CRP concentrations in serum. an endotoxin derived from bacterial membranes is widely used to study the pathophysiologic consequences of endotoxemia and sepsis. sPLA2 plays a central role in the systemic immune response45,46 and although its level increases in sera of volunteer subjects after receiving an intravenous infusion of LPS34 and in rabbits after LPS injection,44 the time-course of changes in serum sPLA2 activity after LPS administration has not been studied thoroughly. sPLA2-IIA (14 kDa) is the predominant form involved in inflammatory immune responses. the persistent presence of sPLA2-IIA in the sera of patients with systemic inflammation1 and bacteremia37 may exacerbate and intensify inflammation. lysophosphatidylcholine was shown to increase the translocation of luminal bacteria. a spike in lysophosphatidylcholine during sepsis may drive an influx of immunogenic material into the body. a spike in lysophosphatidylcholine during sepsis may cause an influx of immunogenic material into the body. sPLA2 activity profile under the 2 doses of LPS was the only point at which the profile differed and was proportionate to the LPS dose. the current and other14,15 studies have shown an influence of GE polyphenolics on modulators of inflammation. this finding raises the question whether the observed effects of GE were at least partly due to the indirect modulation of serum sPLA2 activity at the gastrointestinal level. reduction in hematocrit may have resulted from the cumulative effects of the blood samplings from the animals. eddietary supplementation with GE attenuated the increase in sPLA2 activity and decrease in hematocrit but had little effect on the loss of body weight."}
