{"summary": "vaccines can still be ineffective due to new strains and can exhibit significant off-target effects. the efficacy of antiviral therapeutics can often be limited by pathogen resistance as another sign of the difficulty in keeping up with rapidly evolving viral genomes. STAT2 enables reruitment of STAT1 and release of the phosphorylated STAT1-STAT2 heterodimer bound to IRF-9. this complex binds to the IFN stimulated response element (ISRE) and in concert with recruited transcriptional co-activators. we aimed to mimic the beneficial actions of STAT1 modification with a small molecule that also enhances the activity of the IFN signaling pathway. STAT1-CC-expressing cells show increased activity of the endogenous ISRE promoter element. we used 2fTGH- or HEK293T-ISRE-CBG99 cells to establish an optimal luciferase light reaction time. each cell line showed a distinct IFN- treatment time for maximum signal. 2fTGH-ISRE-CBG99 cells expressing the ISRE-CBG99 construct were treated with IFN- (1000 U/ml for 0\u201314 h) and monitored for luciferase-catalyzed luminescence over 0\u20134 h. signal maximum was found at 50 min, and the optimal measurement window was found at 40\u201370 min. fTGH-ISRE-CBG99 cells treated with IFN- (1000 U/ml) for 7 h compared to 1% DMSO vehicle alone. assay automation and miniaturization exhibited near-maximal signal at 8000 cells per well and consistent well-to-well and plate-to-plate reproducibility. the improvement in IFN signaling in STAT1-CC-expressing cells correlated with prolonged phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 [13]. each compound was tested at 4 different concentrations (0.24, 1.2, 6 and 30 M) and simultaneous treatment with IFN- at 5 U/ml. each assay plate contained control wells containing a range of IFN- concentrations (0\u2013200 U/ml) in quadruplicate. 64 hit compounds were selected for validation based on a combination of dose-response characteristics and inter-replicate reproducibility. idarubicin hydrochloride ranked highest in potency for enhancing ISRE activity. 2fTGH-ISRE-CBG99 cells were treated with idarubicin and IFN- for 8 h. overall significance for idarubicin dose P0.0001, IFN- dose p0.0001, and Interaction p0.0001. the structure for idarubicin shows characteristic features of an anthracycline antibiotic unrelated to any other antiviral compound in clinical use. to further validate the effect of idarubicin on ISRE activity, we tested three other pots. topoisomerase inhibitors Etoposide, Hu-0331, and ICRF-193 caused no significant increase in ISRE activity. these other compounds caused a decrease in ISRE activity in concert with cytotoxic effects at higher concentrations. these findings provide evidence of idarubicin capacity to increase ISRE activity independent of the anti-neoplastic properties of the drug. in ISRE activity independent of IFN production or IFN\u2013IFN-receptor interaction. instead acts downstream of ligand-receptor binding in the IFN signaling pathway. Idarubicin effect on ISRE activity relative to IFN- treatment concentration. idarubicin enhances IFN-driven ISG expression and antiviral activity. idarubicin increased expression of the antiviral gene 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1). there was no effect of drug on ISG expression in STAT1-null U3A cells. 2fTGH cells were treated with idarubicin along with or without IFN- and then assessed for control of encephalomyocarditis virus levels and virus-induced cytopathic effect. idarubicin-dependent improvement in viral control translates into a significant decrease in viral cytopathic effect under those same treatment conditions. idarubicin dose p0.0001, IFN dose p0.0001, and Interaction p = ns. values represent mean SE (n = 3 biological replicates, n = 2 technical replicates) corresponding levels of virus-induced cell toxicity based on cell viability from propidium iodide (PI) staining. 2fTGH-ISRE-CBG99 cells expressing the ISRE-CBG99 construct were treated with IFN- (1000 U/ml for 0\u201314 h) and then monitored for luciferase-catalyzed luminescence. each cell line exhibited a distinct IFN- treatment time for maximum signal. signal maximum was found at 50 min, and the optimal measurement window was found at 40\u201370 min. time course for effect of IFN- (1000 U/ml) and IFN- (100 U/ml) on ISRE activity in 2fTGH-ISRE-CBG99 cells. based HTS assay for 2fTGH-ISRE-CBG99 cells treated with IFN- (1000 U/ml for 7 h) versus DMSO vehicle alone. automated ISRE activity assay performed a screen of a 2240 chemical compound library. 321 data points (out of a total of 8960 data points) had an ISRE activity z-score 2. this data set represented 285 individual compounds. some compounds had an ISRE activity z-score 2 at more than one dose. idarubicin hydrochloride ranked highest in potency for enhancing ISRE activity. idarubicin hydrochloride ranked highest in potency for enhancing ISRE activity. idarubicin exhibited a significant effect at a lower concentration than other compounds. corresponding data for DMXAA and Imiquimod concentration-response for ISRE activity. overall significance for compound dose p = ns, IFN- dose p0.0001, interaction p = ns. idarubicin is best known as an anti-neoplastic agent that acts via DNA intercalation and topoisomerase II inhibition. idarubicin is best known as an anti-neoplastic agent that acts via DNA intercalation and topoisomerase II inhibition. cytotoxic effect of idarubicin is consistent with previous observations. the effect of idarubicin on ISRE activity was observed under baseline conditions when there was no detectable production of endogenous IFN- and no administration of exogenous IFN-. however, the effect of idarubicin on ISRE activity persisted without change during effective IFN-/ receptor 2 blockade. p-values for individual comparisons are from Bonferroni post-tests. for 15 U/ml IFN-, overall significance: anti-IFNARII, p0.0001, IDA dose, p0.0001; interaction, p = 0.0023. for 1 U/ml IFN-, overall significance: anti-IFNARII, p0.0892, IDA dose, p0.0001; interaction, p = 0.3294. there was no effect of drug on ISG expression in STAT1-null cells. we found similar results for the antiviral ISG guanylate-binding protein 1 (GBP1) and three other ISGs (MX1, PARP9, and IRF1). idarubicin-dependent improvement in viral control translates into a significant decrease in viral cytopathic effect. higher concentrations of idarubicin in combination with IFN- treatment caused a significant cytotoxic effect. results with relatively low concentration of idarubicin provide proof-of-concept that a small molecule activator of the ISRE component of the IFN signaling pathway will allow for increased ISG expression and improved control of viral level. study was undertaken to discover antiviral therapeutics that broadly increase host defense. we focused on the IFN system that is central to the antiviral response. some previous investigators have used administration of IFN itself to increase the antiviral response. phenotypic screening can take longer in terms of hit-to-lead development but provide more proteins in the pathway to be targeted. phenotypic screening can take longer in terms of hit-to-lead development but provide more proteins in the pathway to be targeted. idarubicin facilitates STAT1-dependent ISG expression and control of viral replication and cytopathic effect. we found no increase in cytotoxicity in cells treated with idarubicin and IFN together compared to cells treated with idarubicin alone. idarubicin effect on IFN signaling is distinct from the effect on DNA-based cytotoxicity. the enhancing effect of idarubicin is based on ISRE activation and ISG expression independent of IFN production or IFN\u2013IFN-receptor interaction. the effect of idarubicin is due to an action in the IFN signaling pathway distal to ligand-receptor binding, e.g., at the level of receptor-associated JAK kinases. the IFN signaling pathway may provide much greater flexibility and ease of application to achieve transient adjustment of IFN-related actions. our approach should thereby prove useful to discover drugs with activity against a broad range of viruses and consequent scientific and clinical benefit. 2fTGH cells were co-transfected at a 91 ratio into 2fTGH or HEK293T cells to increase the likelihood that cells tolerating puromycin selection (0.5 g/ml) contained one or more copies of pISRE-CBG99 in addition to pPUR. system equipment included: a Caliper Sciclone ALH 3000 workstation (Perkin Elmer) and a EL406 washer (BioTek) for liquid handling, an automated Cytomat incubator (Thermo Scientific) for cell culture environment, a separate hotel for storage of plates at room temperature, a synergy 4 plate reader, a Flexiseal plate heat sealer (K Biosciences, Beverly, MA), a Caliper Twister II, and a cell treatments were timed so that each assay plate would be incubated for 10.3 h before the final step of performing the luciferase assay. the screen took 41.6 h to complete. a z-score transformation was applied to center and scale the data across the experiment. we used self-organizing maps analysis to cluster hit compounds by shape of the dose-response curve. the significance of change from dose to dose was also analyzed using linear models and moderated F-statistics as implemented in the limma package. ase reporter assay was performed in the presence of mouse anti-human IFN-/ receptor chain 2 blocking mAb (clone MMHAE-2;
