{"summary": "coinfections of the respiratory epithelium by viruses and bacteria are a common clinical manifestation. coinfections of the respiratory tract by viruses and bacteria are a common clinical manifestation. coinfections may affect the course of Streptococcus suis infections. suilysin (SLY), the yet only known cytotoxic protein secreted by S. suis, has been studied for its contribution to pathogenesis at different stages in the development of systemic disease induced by S. suis. it has been suggested that SLY facilitates the colonization and the establishment of the initial stages of infection in pigs by promoting host cell lysis and the invasion of S. suis through the epithelium. both S. suis and influenza virus have a cytotoxic effect on epithelial cells. the release of cellular lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was determined during a coinfection. a significant virus-induced cytotoxic effect was detected at 24 h and 48 h after bacterial infection, i.e., 48 h and 72 h after virus infection. coinfection with the suilysin-deficient mutant 10sly did not affect the SIV-induced cytotoxicity. results are expressed as means SEM. significance was determined using one-way ANOVA and the Tukey multiple-comparison test. the initial step in the development of pneumonia is the adherence of bacteria to airway epithelial cells. wt strain 10 and the 10sly mutant were monoinfected with sialic acid. this result is most likely due to the presence of sialic acid on the capsular polysaccharide. the 10sly mutant is encapsulated and can benefit from this adherence mechanism. the areas containing green fluorescent bacteria were determined from the assay. results are expressed as the means SEM. three areas were randomly chosen for each sample. the number of cell-associated bacteria detected on airway epithelial cells was significantly higher in samples coinfected with SIV than in monoinfected cells. these differences were detectable at both time points postinfection, but at 48 hpi they were more pronounced. the quantitative assay does not differentiate between adherent and internalized bacteria. prior to internalization, bacteria need to adhere and, thus, represent adherent bacteria. mono- and coinfected cells were lysed by saponin. cell lysates were plated on Columbia sheep blood agar. results are expressed as the percentage of bacterial colonization. this effect of an influenza virus infection on differentiated airway epithelial cells has been reported recently (33). this may be explained by the loss of infected ciliated cells due to apoptosis. wt and mutant streptococci invaded into deeper areas of the epithelial cell layer. suilysin-deficient mutant showed an invasive phenotype similar to that of the wt bacteria. PBEC were preinfected with 5 104 TCID50/filter H3N2 for 24 h. PBEC were preinfected with 5 104 TCID50/filter H3N2 for 24 h. streptococci are labeled in green, nucleoproteins of H3N2 are stained in red, and nuclei are shown in blue (DAPI) arrows indicate tissue-invasive bacteria, and dashed lines show the location of the supporting membrane. EC infected with the wt S. suis strain but not after monoinfection with the suilysin-deficient mutant 10sly. this finding is consistent with the results of our previous study on S. suis monoinfection of well-differentiated airway epithelial cells. the time-dependent cytotoxicity of experimental LDH release on PBEC was determined. results are expressed as the percent cytotoxicity of experimental LDH release compared to the maximum LDH release of the ALI culture. samples coinfected by SIV and wt S. suis were higher than those coinfected by suilysin-deficient mutant 10sly. this result is most likely due to the presence of sialic acid on the capsular polysaccharide of wt strain 10 and the 10sly mutant. the 10sly mutant is encapsulated and can benefit from this adherence mechanism, too. streptococci are labeled in green, nucleoproteins of H3N2 are stained in red, and nuclei are shown in blue (DAPI) results are expressed as the means SEM, and significance was determined using one-way-ANOVA. cells from mono- and coinfected filters were collected, lysed with 1% saponin, and used to determine the number of CFU. at both 24 and 48 hpi, the number of cell-associated bacteria was significantly higher in samples coinfected with SIV than in monoinfected cells. these differences were detectable at both time points postinfection, but at 48 hpi they were morepronounced. eptococci are labeled in green, the cilia of ciliated cells are stained in red, and nuclei are shown in blue (DAPI) to quantify the colonized bacteria in PBEC, mono- and coinfected cells were lysed by saponin. results are expressed as the percentage of bacterial colonization. the epithelial cell layer of SIV-infected samples was slightly thinner than that of airway cells that were not infected. this effect of an influenza virus infection on differentiated airway epithelial cells has been reported recently. this may be explained by the loss of infected ciliated cells due to apoptosis. PBEC were preinfected with 5 104 TCID50/filter H3N2 for 24 h. the suilysin-deficient mutant showed an invasive phenotype similar to that of the wt bacteria. the mutant may exploit cells preinfected by influenza viruses to adhere to and then invade the airway epithelial cell barrier. bars, 25 m. (B) Immunostaining detection for invasion of streptococci into the bronchiolar epithelium. nucleoproteins of H3N2 are stained in red and nuclei are shown in blue. cytotoxin can induce apoptosis, resulting in epithelial damage. it can mediate the attachment of S. suis to the surface of the respiratory epithelium. however, suilysin-negative clinical isolates are also frequently found in swine populations worldwide. a comparison of the binding of suilysin-deficient bacteria to virus-infected cells and the binding of wt streptococci to uninfected cells. the interaction between capsular sialic acids of S. suis and influenza virus hemagglutinins expressed on the surface of virus-infected cells appears to be a short-term advantage but also a long-term benefit. virus-dependent cytotoxicity was observed only late in infection. a coinfection with influenza viruses and suilysin-negative S. suis bacteria also affect invasion. the more bacteria adhere to the epithelial surface, the more likely invasion events will occur. wt S. suis mutant lacking suilysin acquires invasion capacity when it adheres to areas of the airway epithelial cells that have been preinfected by influenza viruses. a surprising result of our study was that an S. suis mutant lacking suilysin acquires an invasion capacity when it adheres to areas of the airway epithelial cells that have been preinfected. all materials were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. the cells were incubated in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C and passaged every 2 to 3 days. primary porcine bronchial epithelial cells were harvested from the bronchi as previously described. primary PBEC were transferred to type IV collagen-coated transwell polycarbonate membranes (0.4-m pore size; Corning Costar) at a density of 2.5 105 cells per filter and maintained with ALI medium modified as previously described. infection of well-differentiated epithelial cells by swine influenza virus and S. suis was performed 24 h prior to secondary infection with S. suis. cells inoculated with ALI medium only served as mock-infected cells. cytotoxicity was detected by an LDH-release assay. results were normalized by the maximum LDH release from the ALI culture. supernatants were collected from the apical compartments of coinfected, monoinfected, and mock-infected PBEC. ALI cultures were fixed with 3% formaldehyde for 20 min, followed by 5 min of incubation with 0.1 M glycine. the samples were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 20 min at room temperature, followed by three washing steps with PBS. all antibodies were incubated from both sides of the ALI cultures. samples were analyzed by using an inverse immunofluorescent microscope (Nikon Eclipse Ti-S) the area of the epithelial cell surfaces positive for green fluorescent bacteria was analyzed by applying analySIS (version 3.2) software. all experiments were repeated at least three times. the cells were incubated in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C and passaged every 2 to 3 days. ii) Virus stocks were propagated by infection of MDCK cells at a low multiplicity of infection. supernatants were clarified by low-speed centrifugation (200 g, 10 min, room temperature) ine bronchial epithelial cells (PBEC) were harvested from the bronchi as previously described (47) after treatment of tissue segments with antibiotics and proteases, PBEC were harvested by scraping the cells from the luminal surface of the bronchus with a scalpel. the beGM was modified as previously described (48, 49) PBEC (differentiated for at least 4 weeks) were maintained without antibiotics and antimycotics 1 day before viral infection. influenza virus H3N2 strain (5 104 TCID50/filter) was applied to the apical surface of PBEC that had been washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS+) before infection. apical compartments of coinfected, monoinfected, and mock-infected PBEC prior to the washing step at 4 h postinfection. cells were incubated on a horizontal shaker for 5 min to collect the maximum LDH released into the supernatant. the experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated at least three times. ALI cultures were fixed with 3% formaldehyde for 20 min, followed by 5 min of incubation with 0.1 M glycine and three washing steps with PBS. all antibodies were diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS and incubated with the samples for 1 h at room temperature. three areas were randomly chosen for each sample. all experiments were repeated at least three times. results are presented as the percentage of bacterial fluorescence."}
