{"summary": "seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses, human parainfluenza virus (hPIV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and coronaviruses cause substantial burden of disease globally. currently no licensed hPIV and hPIV vaccines are available for influenza. universal influenza vaccines are most commonly used to protect risk groups against seasonal influenza virus infection. trivalent inactivated vaccines are most commonly used to protect risk groups against seasonal influenza virus infection. vaccines contain components of three virus strains responsible for epidemic outbreaks. inactivated influenza vaccines inefficiently induce virus-specific CD8+ T cells. this contributes to cross-protective immunity. these limitations underscore the need for novel vaccine production platforms. HA stalk-specific antibodies are induced after influenza virus infection or vaccination [11,17,18,19,20] but the magnitude of the stalk-specific antibody response varies considerably between individuals. it has been shown that passive immunization with stalk-specific antibodies affords protection against infection with a heterologous influenza virus in mice and ferrets. a standalone NA-based vaccine would not be the most attractive candidate for universal influenza vaccine development. however, the addition of NA to an HA component can improve the virusspecific antibody response. M2-based vaccines can provide long-term protection against a heterologous virus. however, combining M2 with another influenza antigen could induce a better protective immune response [49]. cross-reactive anamnestic T cells contribute to cross-protective immunity. cross-reactive anamnestic T cell responses contribute to accelerated clearance of infection and reduction of clinical symptoms. a universal influenza vaccine activates both arms of the adaptive immune system. trivalent inactivated vaccines are most commonly used to protect risk groups against seasonal influenza virus infection. these vaccines contain components of three virus strains responsible for epidemic outbreaks: H1N1 and H3N2 influenza A viruses and an influenza B virus. inactivated influenza vaccines inefficiently induce virus-specific CD8+ T cells. this contributes to cross-protective immunity. these limitations underscore the need for novel vaccine production platforms. HA stalk-specific antibodies are induced after influenza virus infection or vaccination. however, the magnitude of the stalk-specific antibody response varies considerably. passive immunization with stalk-specific antibodies affords protection against infection with a heterologous influenza virus in mice and ferrets [11,15,18,21,22,23,24,25,26] a standalone NA-based vaccine would not be the most attractive candidate for universal influenza vaccine development. however, the addition of NA to an HA component can improve the virusspecific antibody response. M2-based vaccines can provide long-term protection against a heterologous virus. combining M2 with another influenza antigen could induce a better protective immune response. cross-reactive anamnestic T cells contribute to cross-protective immunity. cross-reactive anamnestic T cell responses contribute to accelerated clearance of infection. cross-reactive anamnestic T cell responses contribute to accelerated clearance of infection and reduction of clinical symptoms. the development of the attenuated Vaccinia Virus Strain MVA Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) was derived from Chorioallantois Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) through serial passaging in chicken embryo fibroblasts. from 1968\u20131985, the Bavarian State Vaccine Institute produced MVA as a human smallpox vaccine. recombinant MVA viruses as genetically modified organisms can be used under conditions of biosafety level 1 in most countries. the latter attribute is an important advantage compared to replication competent poxvirus vectors (BSL 2 organisms) recombinant genes are only transiently expressed after the infection with non-replicating MVA. the efficacy of the MVA vaccinations compared favorably to the outcome of immunizations with replication competent VACV vectors in mice and non-human primates. however, the efficacy of the MVA vaccinations compared favorably to the outcome of immunizations with replication competent VACV vectors in mice and non-human primates. the development of the attenuated Vaccinia Virus Strain MVA Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) was derived from Chorioallantois Vaccinia virus Ankara (CVA) through serial passaging in chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) from 1968\u20131985, the Bavarian State Vaccine Institute produced MVA as a human smallpox vaccine. recombinant MVA viruses as genetically modified organisms can be used under conditions of biosafety level 1 in most countries. the latter attribute is an important advantage compared to replication competent poxvirus vectors. recombinant genes are only transiently expressed after the infection with non-replicating MVA. the efficacy of the MVA vaccinations compared favorably to the outcome of immunizations with replication competent VACV vectors in mice and non-human primates. however, unlike other VACV strains MVA does not produce the soluble virus proteins that function as receptor-like inhibitors of type I and type II interferons, tumor necrosis factor and chemokines. it has been tested as candidate vaccine against influenza in several studies. it has been shown that with MVA this is not an issue, since protective immunity could be induced against influenza in the presence of pre-existing vector immunity [106]. the development of efficacious H5N1 vaccines is complicated by the co-circulation of viruses that belong to various antigenically distinct clades. the development of efficacious H5N1 vaccines is complicated by the co-circulation of viruses that belong to various antigenically distinct clades. the development of efficacious H5N1 vaccines is complicated by the co-circulation of viruses that belong to various antigenically distinct clades. several recombinant MVA vaccines have been constructed and tested in various animal models. MVA expressing the HA gene of influenza virus strain A/Vietnam/04 (MVA-HA-VN/04) induced strong antibody responses that cross-reacted with other viruses to some extent and protected mice from infection with homologous and heterologous viruses. a single immunization with a dose in the range of 105\u2013108 PFU resulted in protection from disease, albeit no sterile immunity was achieved. a single immunization with a dose in the range of 105\u2013108 PFU resulted in protection from disease, albeit no sterile immunity was achieved. recombinant MVA expressing both the HA and NP genes have been constructed. other vaccines have been prepared with HA genes obtained from influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34. recombinant MVA-HA1+NP induces heterosubtypic immunity. vaccine induces mainly virus-specific CD8+ T cells, which can be detected one week after intramuscular immunization [119] and induced protective immunity against an experimental infection one month after vaccination. the vaccine was not only tested in healthy adults, 18\u201345 years, but also in people over 60 years of age. HA-stalk combined with NP, HA-stalk in combination with four repeats of M2e derived from H5N1, H9N2, H7N2 and H1N1 viruses. subsequently infected with influenza virus subtypes with pandemic potential: H5N1, H7N1 or mouse adapted H9N2. the development of efficacious H5N1 vaccines is complicated by the co-circulation of viruses that belong to various antigenically distinct clades. several recombinant MVA vaccines expressing an HA gene of various A/H5N1 viruses have been constructed and tested in various animal models. two immunizations with a dose as low as 104 PFU were sufficient to induce protective immunity against infection with homologous and heterologous viruses. however, a single immunization with a dose in the range of 105\u2013108 PFU resulted in protection from disease, albeit no sterile immunity was achieved. an MVA-based vaccine would have been able to induce protective immunity against the virus that caused the pandemic of 2009. the extent of cross-protection against unrelated H1N1 viruses may have been limited. the development of efficacious H5N1 vaccines is complicated by the co-circulation of viruses belonging to various antigenically distinct clades. two immunizations with 108 PFU protected cynomolgus macaques against infection with influenza viruses A/Vietnam/1194/04 and A/Indonesia/5/05. a single immunization with a dose in the range of 105\u2013108 PFU resulted in protection from disease. the HA gene of a prototypic strain was cloned into MVA. protection correlated with the induction of virus neutralizing antibodies. cross-protective immunity against some but not all swine A/H1N1 influenza viruses was induced. recombinant MVA induced cross-protective immunity against infection with the homologous pandemic H1N1 strain, an unrelated H1N1 strain and an H5N1 influenza virus. this recombinant MVA induced only protection against H5N1 virus and the pandemic H1N1 strain [106]. the strongest T cell responses were obtained after intramuscular administration (adenovirus vector) and intranasal or intramuscular administration (MVA) compared to intradermal injection. combination vaccination strategy protected mice from a heterologous challenge infection six months after immunization. all the other MVA vaccines tested, MVA-HA-stalk, MVA-HA-stalk+M2e, MVA-M1, MVA-M2, MVA-PB1 failed to induce protective immunity. the vector holds great promise as a vaccine platform for respiratory viruses in general. infections with these viruses are among the leading reasons for pediatric hospitalizations. first generation candidate vaccines against RSV expressed recombinant gene sequences encoding for either the RSV fusion protein (F) or the glycoprotein (G) or both envelope antigens together. in mice, all recombinant MVA induced RSV-specific antibodies were even higher than those found after experimental RSV infection. intramuscular vaccination of calves with bRSV induced bRSV specific IgG antibody and CD8+ T cell responses. however, complete protection against bRSV infection or replication was not achieved. previous studies suggested the safety and at least partial efficacy of first generation recombinant MVA vaccines against PIV or RSV. recombinant MVA vaccine producing SARS-CoV S antigen was found to induce high level (neutralizing) antibody responses in mice, rabbits and rhesus macaques. a first candidate MVA vector vaccine producing the S glycoprotein of MERS-CoV (MVA-MERS-S) was obtained within the year of the appearance of MERS-CoV. recombinant MVA co-producing the fusion (F) and hemagglutinin-neuramidase proteins of PIV3 have been generated for preclinical testing in animal models. recombinant MVA elicited high levels of PIV-specific antibodies upon immunization by intramuscular or intranasal application. recombinant MVA vaccines also induced protection against PIV challenge. a parallel immunization study in infant cynomolgus macaques suggested vaccination with recombinant MVA did not predispose for an RSV associated immunopathology. however, the combined intramuscular/intranasal immunization of these infant (1 year old) macaques with the recombinant MVA failed to provide protection against bRSV replication in the lower respiratory tract. at present, there are no vaccines available which are approved for emergency use in humans to prevent either SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV infections. in 2004, recombinant MVA expressing the spike (S) protein was generated and demonstrated to elicit virus neutralizing antibodies in mice, rabbits and rhesus macaques. the rapid application of recombinant MVA in response to the appearance of SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV demonstrates the suitability of this vector system to readily respond to potential threats of suddenly emerging infectious diseases. established standard protocols allow rapidly obtaining recombinant MVA (rMVA) which are suitable for clinical evaluation. the process from cloning to obtaining the rMVA takes about 6\u201312 weeks. primary CEFs are readily prepared from embryonated eggs without need for further amplification. but cryopreservation impacts the quality of the cells. a newly developed rMVA vaccine is tested in vitro to assess correct gene insertion and protein expression in rMVA infected cells. the vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy is tested in mice, ferrets and/or macaques. there are some pitfalls in the development of a novel recombinant MVA vaccine. in the case of influenza, special procedures are in place in the u.s. to speed up the authorization process for novel vaccines. the normal procedure to approve a new vaccine takes 18\u201324 months, which obviously is too long for a novel vaccine in the case of influenza pandemics. rMVA vaccines have an excellent safety profile considering clinical use and protection of the general environment. rMVA vaccines are expected to be very stable over time."}
