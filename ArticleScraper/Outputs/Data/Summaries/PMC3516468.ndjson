{"summary": "expelled air dispersion distances during coughing were 68, 30 and 15 cm along median sagittal plane when the HPS wore no mask, a surgical mask and a N95 mask. the distances were reduced to 30, 24 and 12 cm during coughing effort as in severe lung injury. respiratory infections such as influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome may spread by airborne route,[3]\u2013[5], [6]. non-invasive ventilation in the presence of an imbalanced medical ward airflow may lead to opportunistic airborne influenza transmission. standard and droplet precautions are important infection control measures for preventing transmission of influenza in most healthcare situations. the room ventilation system was set at a pressure of 7.4 Pa and 16 air changes per hour. the simulator removed oxygen and injected carbon dioxide into the system. Flow rates were reduced to 320L/min and 220 L/min to simulate coughing efforts in moderate and severe lung injury. images were captured by a high-definition camera positioned to the left side of the simulator when examining the cough propagation distances in the median sagittal plane. smoke concentration was estimated from the light scattered by smoke particles. frames were extracted from the beginning of each cough, to generate an ensemble average for the corresponding instant of the coughing bouts. the time at which the normalized concentration contours spread over the widest region, from the mouth of the HPS, was chosen for the ensemble average to estimate the greatest dispersion distance[13]\u2013[19]. the study received approval for non-ionizing radiation and biological/chemical safety. a generalized linear model was used to estimate the difference in exhaled air dispersion among different masks and during varying extent of lung injury. a 2-tailed p value 0.05 was considered statistically significant. the laser light-sheet was initially positioned in the median sagittal plane of the HPS. this allowed us to investigate the regions directly above and lateral to the mask of the HPS[13]\u2013[19]. all coughing jet plume images were captured by the high-definition video camera. frames were extracted from the beginning of each cough, to generate an ensemble average for the corresponding instant of the coughing bouts. the time at which the normalized concentration contours spread over the widest region, from the mouth of the HPS, was chosen for the ensemble average to estimate the greatest dispersion distance[13]\u2013[19]. significant exposure was arbitrarily defined as where there was at least 20% of normalized smoke concentration[13]\u2013[19]. study received approval for non-ionizing radiation and biological/chemical safety by the Chinese University of Hong Kong. peak cough velocity 95%CI Mean cough velocity 95%CI Normal 7.390.25 7.23\u20137.55 3.360.40 3.10\u20133.61 Moderate 6.720.23 6.57\u20136.86 2.57\u20132.90 Weak 5.450.29 5.26\u20135.63 1.490.32 1.29\u20131.69 * Peak and mean cough velocities are expressed in m/s. the use of surgical mask or N95 mask further reduced the dispersion distance to 27.2 2.4 cm, 14.0 1.6 cm (p 0.001) in moderate and severe lung injury. there was again substantial leakage through the mask-nasal bridge interface to the upward direction. the N95 mask prevented the forward leakage well, with slight leakage through the nasal bridge to the upward direction. our coughing propagation distances from the HPS would support the WHO recommendation for the HCW to wear a medical mask if working within approximately 1 m from the patient or upon entering the room/cubicle of a patient on droplet precautions [12]. Surgical masks appeared to be as effective as N95 respirators for respiratory protection of HCWs during the routine care of patients hospitalized with seasonal influenza, [32], [33] and were also as effective in reducing production of infectious aerosols during cough Tang et al[38]\u2013[40] examined cough aerodynamics in healthy subjects in the upright position using the Schlieren and shadowgraph imaging techniques. it was estimated that voluntary human coughing led to airflow propagation distances of 0.55 m and 0.64 m in females and males respectively. a surgical mask could redirect it in a less harmful direction around the top, bottom and the sides of the mask. the smoke particles in this study would therefore represent the \u201cupper bound\u201d estimates for the dispersion of droplets which would be expected to follow a shorter trajectory than the air jet due to gravitational effects. the peak cough velocity during normal coughing was close to the healthy human peak coughing data of 8 m/s."}
