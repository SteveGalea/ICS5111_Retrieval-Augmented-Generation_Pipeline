{"summary": "traditional medicine served most of the population when the Communist Party prevailed in 1949. traditional medicine remains widely accepted throughout China. 1949-1978 Communist ascendency occurred in China while Stalin presided. the shift to a more market-based system commenced and was outlined in the Sixth Five-Year Plan for 1981-1985. it called for use of new technology and some banking reform. it also sought to shift resources toward consumption and away from investment, at least in relative terms. health sector grew rapidly in this period but not always as fast as gross domestic product (GDP) growth of the health sector was increasingly financed from out-of-pocket household spending. out-of-pocket spending as a share of the total peaked in 2001 at about 60% of China\u2019s health spending. there was growing consensus that organizational self-sufficiency in the absence of much more widespread insurance was problematic. there was also a serious public health scare with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) there was also a serious public health scare with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) rising per capita income is expected to drive up this share. the shift to services has important implications. services, including those in health care, have historically shown relatively weak productivity growth. primary data sources include various editions of the China Statistical Yearbook and the Chinese Health Sector Statistical Yearbook for 1990-2012. multivariate analyses use ordinary least squares analysis in SPSS version 16.0 and Excel for Windows 7 to study determinants of household savings. savings is the difference between per capita disposable income and per capita consumption expressed as a proportion of per capita disposable income. data for expenditures on residential housing and education are derived from surveys. independent variables are constructed to measure shares of housing and education spending by households relative to disposable income. *** 0.326 1.982 0.063* 1.025 4.691 0.000*** Health insurance payout 0.965 16.758 0.000*** 0.305 3.296 0.004** 0.712 3.704 0.002** 0.230 1.808 0.087* Residential house spending 0.387 1.913 0.072* 0.026 0.247 0.808 Education spending 0.328 1.1855 0.080* 0.191 0.811 0.428 Adjusted R2.927.811.938 health insurance may release pent-up demand, particularly in poorer rural regions. positive correlation with residential housing expenditure was expected. education spending, an investment in human capital, is seen as a form of savings in this Confucian-oriented society. results indicated that multicollinearity may be a problem for the urban model that included education and residential home spending as independent variables. this calls into question quality of the coefficients associated with the independent variables. professional hegemony by physicians is well-established in china and includes senior hospital management positions. this is unlikely to change soon, but it will be more difficult to sustain in increasingly complex environments, and encroachment by other influences can be expected."}
