{"summary": "Background Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important viral agent causing severe respiratory disease in infants and young children. syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important viral agent causing severe illness in infants and young children. the contribution of RSV to influenza-like illness needs to be assessed if this is to be used as a clinical endpoint for evaluating influenza vaccine effectiveness [10,11]. advances in the development of RSV vaccines has prompted a need for research into the societal and economic impact of RSV infection. methods Influenza and RSV data available in the EISS database for the 2002\u20132003 winter (weeks 40/2002 to 20/2003) were analysed. data from both sentinel practitioners and other sources (from hospitals, non-sentinel physicians, residential institutions) were used. sentinel networks in England and Scotland did not apply a precise case definition for influenza-like illness. the case definition used in the Netherlands contained the following criteria: sudden onset of respiratory symptoms with infection context (fever, headaches), in the absence of other diagnosis. Specimen collection and analysis Combined nose and/or throat swabs were obtained from selected patients presenting to physicians in sentinel practices with influenza-like illness. general practitioners in Scotland were requested to sample patients with acute respiratory infections in the absence of influenza-like illness. the case definition used in the Netherlands contained the following criteria: an acute onset of illness with infection context (fever, headaches), in the absence of other diagnosis. the selection of patients for swabbing was not based on pre-established diagnostic criteria. in france many samples were obtained from children because paediatricians as well as general practitioners are included in the surveillance network [22] in the Netherlands, RSV was detected in one person aged over 65 years. in the Netherlands, the percentage of RSV positive reports (26.7%) was higher than that for influenza (21.3%; Chi2 = 3.9, p = 0.048). non-sentinel data showed 92% or more of the RSV positive reports were obtained in children 0 to 4 years. most confirmed influenza cases in the 0\u20134 and 15\u201364 age groups. sentinel and non-sentinel specimens tested positive for influenza. sentinel and non-sentinel specimens tested positive for influenza. in the Netherlands, RSV was detected in one person aged over 65 years. in the Netherlands, the percentage of RSV positive reports (26.7%) was higher than that for influenza (21.3%; Chi2 = 3.9, p = 0.048). d for each of the four countries in Table 2. RSV detections by country and age group. Sentinel data indicated more influenza reports than RSV in children aged 5\u201314 years. highest specimen positive proportions of influenza viruses were reported in children aged 5\u201314 years. non-sentinel data showed most confirmed influenza cases in the 0\u20134 and 15\u201364 age groups. data on influenza was reported for 97 out of 104 weeks for the four countries. reports were made in a timely manner in 87 out of 104 weeks. virological investigation for a common condition is not economically justifiable. more RSV than influenza virus was reported for one of the winter seasons (1997\u201398), this finding is similar to what we have reported for 2002\u20132003. the best site to collect material for viral detection may differ between influenza virus and RSV. 83 (13.9%) sentinel swabs tested positive for picornavirus during the 2002\u20132003 winter season. positivity rates differed considerably between countries: e.g. in Scotland the percentage positive for RSV and influenza was only 8%. in the future, the EISS might implement more respiratory viruses simultaneously after introducing RSV. conclusion Our conclusions relate to recommendations for an RSV surveillance programme. both combined nose/throat swabs and nasal pharyngeal aspirates are acceptable for RSV diagnosis. members of the European Influenza Surveillance Scheme are: Lisa Domegan (Health Protection Surveillance Centre, Dublin), Douglas Fleming (Royal College of general practitioners, Birmingham), Anne Mosnier (GROG/Open Rome, Paris), Maja Socan (National Institute of Public Health, Ljubljana), Brunhilde Schweiger (Robert Koch Institute, Berlin) and Helena Rebelo de Andrade (Instituto Nacional de Saude, Lisbon)."}
