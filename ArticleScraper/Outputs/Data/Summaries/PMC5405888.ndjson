{"summary": "obstructive hydrocephalus developed as a complication of an ischaemic infarct in the rostral cerebellar artery. clinical findings, diagnostic investigations, treatment and prognosis are reported. the cat was suspected to have a right-sided paradoxal vestibular syndrome. a vascular accident was considered most likely because of the abrupt onset of the clinical signs without pain during examination. other potential causes included traumatic, neoplastic, infectious/inflammatory disease of the central nervous system. vital parameter monitoring during general anaesthesia was obtained via Magnitude 31 MRI compatible monitoring. included electrocardiogram, pulse oximetry, capnography (CO2) in the respiratory gases, oscillometric blood pressures and respiration rates. a single, focal cerebellar lesion that was isointense to grey matter on T1W images. hyperintense wedge-shaped lesion visible in the right rostral cerebellum radiating dorsally towards the dorsal surface of the cerebellum and ventrally towards the fourth ventricle. ventricular system was asymmetrically enlarged, and dilatation of the right olfactory recess could be clearly appreciated in both transverse and dorsal T2W images. a narrowing of the cerebral sulci and obliteration of the subarachnoid space around the dorsal convexity of the cerebral hemispheres were also evident. on the transverse T2W image, it was possible to observe a deformation of the interthalamic adhesion with loss of its distinctly circular shape. overcrowding of the caudal cranial fossa without cerebellar herniation was septic thromboembolism associated with bacterial endocarditis or other infectious diseases. aortic and cardiac thromboembolism secondary to cardiovascular disease or hyperthyroidism. parasite migration (eg, Cuterebra species larvae) or parasitic emboli (eg, Dirofilaria species) were within normal limits. cat remained on continuous IV administration of crystalloid at a dose of 4 ml/kg/h. on IV administration of potentiated amoxicillin at a dose of 20 mg/kg q12h. level of consciousness, heart rate and respiratory rate were monitored hourly. cat was found unconscious in lateral recumbency with bilateral mydriasis. deficits characterised by ataxia with or without hypermetria, non-ambulatory paresis, head tilt, nystagmus, ventrolateral strabismus, decreased menace response, postural and proprioceptive deficits. Ischaemia results in energy deprivation, leading to the development of anaerobic glycolysis, lactic acidosis, inflammation, free radical formation, capillary endothelial damage and blood\u2013brain barrier disruption the abnormality on MRI was confined to the specific territory supplied by the RCA, had a sharp demarcation from the surrounding parenchyma. the presumed infarcted area presented with increased T1 and T2 prolongation time that resulted in low signal intensity. in T1W and FLAIR images it was possible to appreciate a moderate mass effect of the presumed infarcted area on the surrounding brain parenchyma. the narrowing of the cerebral sulci and the obliteration of the subarachnoid space are most likely the result of the high pressure in the ventricle and the low pressure in the arachnoid space. however, there is also the possibility that the overcrowding is simply an incidental finding that is often encountered in domestic shorthair cats. neoplastic or inflammatory conditions are reported to be not helpful in the treatment of cytotoxic oedema. these drugs were used instead when the cat acutely deteriorated in an attempt to control the vasogenic oedema that was causing the neurological deterioration. prompt action focused on medically reducing ICP with administration of mannitol and steroids may have helped achieve a better outcome."}
