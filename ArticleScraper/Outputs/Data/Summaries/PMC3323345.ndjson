{"summary": ">15,000 people with an epidemiologic exposure to SARS were instructed to remain in voluntary quarantine. they were told not to leave their homes or have visitors. they were told to wash their hands frequently, wear masks when in the same room as other household members, not to share personal items. the CES-D is a measure of depressive symptoms composed of 20 self-report items, each with a Likert rating scale from 0 to 4. a score of >16 on the IES-R was used to estimate the prevalence of depressive symptoms (10,12,13) a p value of 0.05 was considered to be significant for all analyses. the development and confirmation of the thematic coding structure is an iterative process involving two researchers in individual, recursive reading of the textual data and group meetings to discuss and test emerging themes. IES-R is a self-report measure designed to assess current subjective distress resulting from a traumatic life event. the IES-R is a measure of depressive symptoms composed of 22 items, each with a Likert rating scale from 0 to 4. The maximum score is 88. the Cochran-Armitage test was used to examine relations between the IES-R and CES-D scores and the following independent variables. relationships between income categories and both PTSD and depressive symptoms were analyzed. a p value of 0.05 was considered significant for all analyses. 129 respondents described 143 periods of quarantine. 90% of respondents were placed into quarantine only once. half of respondents knew someone who was hospitalized with SARS. 10% knew someone who had died of SARS. the source of notification for quarantine influenced understanding of the reason for quarantine. healthcare workers were also more likely to understand the reason for quarantine than non-healthcare workers. Combined household income and level of education did not influence understanding of the reason for quarantine. IES-R score was 15.217.8, and the mean CES-D was 13.011.6. CES-D score was >16 in 31.2% of quarantined persons. no differences between healthcare workers and nonhealthcare workers were found.

Neither age, level of education, healthcare worker status, living with other adult household members, nor having children were correlated with PTSD and depressive symptoms. all respondents described a sense of isolation. lack of social and physical contact with family members was particularly difficult. self-monitoring of temperature provoked considerable anxiety. 129 respondents described 143 periods of quarantine. 90% of respondents were placed into quarantine only once. 66% of respondents were on home quarantine, while 34% were on work quarantine. most (68%) understood that they were quarantined to prevent them from transmitting infection to others. 8.5% believed they were quarantined to protect themselves from infection. 15% did not believe they should have been placed into quarantine at all. healthcare workers more frequently reported that they had received adequate information. 78.8% versus 60.5% (p = 0.03) adherence to home infection control measures. no differences between healthcare workers and nonhealthcare workers were found.

PTSD is an anxiety disorder characterized by avoiding stimuli associated with a traumatic event, reexperiencing the trauma, and hyperarousal. this disorder may develop after exposure to traumatic events that involve a life-threatening component. a person's vulnerability to the development of PTSD can be increased if the trauma is perceived to be a personal assault. as many as 50% of respondents felt that they had not received adequate information regarding at least one aspect of home infection control. lack of knowledge, incomplete understanding of the rationale for these measures, and lack of reinforcement from an overwhelmed public health system were likely contributors to this problem. lack of funding, confidentiality of public health records, and overloaded public health response system limited sampling. a study conducted several months later would have been subject to the limitations of substantial recall bias. a matched control group of persons who were not quarantined should be considered because it would allow an assessment of the distress experienced by the community at large. future studies should assess persons for other psychological responses, including fear, anger, guilt, and stigmatization. inconsistencies: \"information was not always the same. Many inconsistencies\" iii: onset of symptoms: \"what symptoms were considered serious and what to do when I experienced those symptoms\" iii. info is largely unknown\" (respondent #53) iv. mode of transmission: \"if airborne what were the chances of contracting the disease...
