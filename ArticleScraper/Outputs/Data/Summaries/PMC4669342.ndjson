{"summary": "a number of antioxidants, including ascorbate, urate, and glutathione (GSH), are present in high levels in the alveolar epithelial lining fluid (9, 13, 59, 74, 86, 140, 149) the redox potential of the GSH-to-oxidized GSH (GSSG) ratio is known to correlate with the ability of the lungs to suppress an oxidative insult (11, 150) takemura and colleagues examined the role of cholinergic regulation of ENaC in alveolar epithelial cells. they found that carbachol and oxotremorine activated muscarinic receptors in AT2 cells and activated ENaC in a dose-dependent manner, whereas nicotine did not. this activity could be blocked with atropine, supporting the view that ENaC activity was induced by activation of muscarinic cholinergic receptors uPA is a serine protease that converts plasminogen to active plasmin, triggering a proteolysis cascade that promotes fibrinolysis. uPA is expressed in the airways, and its activity is readily detectable in lung lavage fluids of normal animals. increased ENaC activity will limit the degree of alveolar edema in ALI. increased ENaC activity will limit the degree of alveolar edema in ALI. increased ENaC activity will limit the degree of alveolar edema. greenlee and coworkers point out an interesting correlation between estradiol and complications in female influenza patients. low levels of estradiol in female influenza patients lead to reduced AFC. the mechanisms involved here should be investigated further. both treatments downregulated -ENaC message via the ERK and p38 MAPK pathways. the effects could be due to a proinflammatory response, whereas cycloheximide inhibited ENaC through posttranscriptional effects. on et al. (35) used a mouse PKC KO model. they showed that all three ENaC subunits were expressed at lower levels in the KO mouse lung. this correlated with decreased Na+ transport in AT2 cells. a PKC-PKC double KO was used in patch-clamp experiments. it has been shown that reactive intermediates damage ENaC and inhibit Na+-driven AFC in vivo. there is also evidence that another isoform of PKC (PKC) is involved in the downregulation of ENaC. CF and a Mutation in the ENaC -Subunit ASL levels and composition are regulated by a critical balance between Na+ absorption and Cl/bicarbonate secretion (23). in CF, the Cl and bicarbonate channel CFTR has severely compromised surface expression and/or function. loss of CFTR function leads to dysregulated ENaC function (82) ENaC in airway epithelial, short palate lung and nasal epithelial clone 1 (SPLUNC1) has been shown to be useful in treating Na+ hyperabsorption in CF airway epithelial cultures. there are two pools of ENaC channels at the cell surface, an active proteolytically cleaved pool and an inactive noncleaved pool. a functional ENaC is composed of at least one -like subunit ( or ) and that the - and -subunits are required to amplify channel activity (66) in the lung, the -ENaC subunit has been found in human primary alveolar cells and shown to contribute 50% of the amiloride-sensitive salt transport across human nasal epithelial cells. epinephrine in cells that do not express ENaC is stimulated by nitric oxide and compounds that increase cGMP (17, 19) this -adrenergic receptor agonist stimulated two Cl channels, CFTR and TMEM16A. TMEM16A was shown to be present in serous cells and Calu-3 cells (72), as well as human and mouse lung airway smooth muscle cells (42) increased Na+ absorption across the alveolar epithelium contributes to the pathophysiology of pulmonary diseases (reviewed in Refs. 94 and 98), including ALI and ARDS (54, 63, 98). a number of studies found protective effects of MSC therapy, despite low engraftment rates. MSCs exposed for 12 h to normoxia (MSC-M) and conditioned medium from MSCs exposed to hypoxia plus the cytokine mixture (HCYT-MSC-M) the HCYT-MSC-M used in this model was tested to mimic the effects of MSCs in the injured lung. results support the idea that appropriate paracrine factors produced by MSCs in the injured lung hold therapeutic promise. swine bone marrow-derived MSCs administered intravenously during the rapid phase of lung injury in influenza-infected mice would be beneficial in reducing epithelial injury. swine bone marrow-derived MSCs express sialic acid receptors for hemagglutinin binding and, when infected by influenza, secrete proinflammatory cytokines. compound A blocked cigarette smoke-induced ASL dehydration in the bronchial epithelial cultures. compound A was used to demonstrate that inhibition of ENaC is a viable strategy in chronic lung diseases. but, unfortunately, it would be unsuitable as a therapeutic because of its effects on renal handling of potassium.
