{"summary": "two multi-epitope vaccines (MEVs) are composed of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and helper T lymphocyte (HTL) epitopes. both the MEVs carry potential B-cell linear epitope regions, B-cell discontinuous epitopes as well as interferon-inducing epitopes. cDNA analysis of both the MEVs has shown high expression tendency in mammalian host cell line (human) both the MEVs are predicted to elicit humoral as well as cell mediated immune response. epitopes of the designed MEVs are predicted to cover large human population worldwide. protein ORF1a (4P16) and ORF1ab (4WUR) are papain-like proteases (PL(pro) involved in viral infection. protein ORF1ab (5WWP) is a helicase protein of MERS-CoV. both CTL and HTL MEVs contain overlapping regions of linear B-cell epitopes. both MEVs also contain human -defensin-2 (hBD-2) and human -defensin-3 (hBD-3) as adjuvants. analyzed and predicted to be highly expressing in a mammalian host cell line. proteins critically involved in virus\u2013host cell interaction, viral proliferation, and host cell disruption were chosen. a total of 2,499 amino acid sequences belonging to different proteins of MERS-CoV of different strains and origins were retrieved. protein; M protein; ORFs (ORF3, ORF4a, ORF4b, and ORF5); ORF1a (4P16), a papain-like protease (PL(pro)); ORF1ab (4WUR), a PL(pro); ORF1ab (5WWP); and ORF8b. a total of 2,499 amino acid sequences belonging to different proteins of MERS-CoV of different strains and origins were epitopes with high, intermediate, and least affinity of binding to an HLA allele have IC50 values 50 nM, 500 nM, and 5,000 nM, respectively. immunogenicity of the screened CTL epitopes was also obtained by the tool of IEDB. tope prediction Sequence-based B-cell epitope prediction Protein sequence-based linear epitopes were predicted by six different prediction methods available at the tool of IEDB server. these tools are based on the propensity scale method and physicochemical properties of the antigenic sequence. shortlisted CTL, HTL, and B-cell epitopes were subjected to conservancy analysis by the \u201cEpitope Conservancy Analysis\u201d tool (http://tools.iedb.org/conservancy/) of IEDB among all their respective source protein sequences of MERS-CoV. Molecular interaction analysis of selected epitopes with HLA alleles Tertiary structure modeling of HLA alleles and selected T-cell epitopes Template-based homology modeling for HLA class I and II allele binders of the shortlisted epitopes was performed by the Swiss-model. Molecular interaction analysis (docking) of selected CTL epitopes with TAP Molecular docking study was performed by AutoDock Vina. for more accurate prediction, instead of homology modeling, the cryo-EM structure of TAP (PDB ID: 5u1d) was used. human -defensin-2 and -defensin-3 were used as adjuvant at N and C terminals. epitopes from different proteins are colored in different colors. C-terminal 6xHis is designated as His tag. physicochemical analysis of MEVs was used. ProtParam analysis performs empirical investigation for a given protein amino acid sequence. 3D structure modeling and refinement of MEVs. Molecular docking and MD simulation study of CTL and HTL MEVs were subjected to discontinuous B-cell epitope prediction using the ElliPro tool. the tool provides GC content, codon adaptation index (CAI), and tandem rare codon frequency. the total score generated by the tool is a combined score of proteasome, TAP (N-terminal interaction), major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and processing analysis scores. the score is generated using the combination of six methods, namely Consensus, NN-align, SMM-align, and Combinatorial Library. use of multi-epitopes involving both CTL and HTL epitopes would have the higher probability of larger human population coverage worldwide. based on propensity scale method and physicochemical properties of the antigenic sequence. Discontinuous epitopes predicted by ElliPro are clustered on the basis of distance R in between two residues\u2019 centers of mass lying outside the largest possible ellipsoid. the larger the value of R, the larger the number of discontinuous epitopes clustered. IEDB tool \"MHC-II Binding Predictions\" was used to screen HTL epitopes. the percentageile rank for each peptide is generated by the combination of three methods. the rank was generated by the median percentile rank of the three methods. discontinuous epitopes predicted by ElliPro are clustered on the basis of distance R in between two residues\u2019 centers of mass lying outside the largest possible ellipsoid. the larger the value of R, the larger the number of discontinuous epitopes clustered. discontinuous epitopes predicted by ElliPro are clustered on the basis of distance R in between two residues\u2019 centers of mass lying outside the largest possible ellipsoid. the larger the value of R, the larger the number of discontinuous epitopes clustered. epitope toxicity prediction Toxicity assessment of CTL and HTL epitopes and B-cell epitopes was performed by toxinPred (http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/toxinpred/multi_submit.php) s and B-cell epitopes was performed by toxinPred (http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/toxinpred/multi_submit.php) analysis. analysis allows to identify highly toxic or nontoxic peptides. the QMEAN value is a composite (both global and local [ie, per residue] structure) quality estimate of the generated model. models with an acceptable QMEAN value with a cutoff of 4.0 were chosen for further studies. protein sequences of the shortlisted epitopes were retrieved from IPD-IMGT/HLA. template with high sequence identity was chosen for modeling. the models thus generated were validated for quality by the qualitative model energy ANalysis (QMEAN) analysis. hBD-2 and hBD-3 were used as adjuvants for both MEVs at N and C terminals. human -defensin-2 and -defensin-3 were used as adjuvants. epitopes from different proteins are colored in different colors. the prediction is based on a dataset of IFN--inducing and IFN--noninducing MHC class II binders. physiochemical properties of CTL and HTL MEVs, ProtParam (https://web.expasy.org/protparam/) was used. 3D structure modeling and refinement of MEVs Both the CTL and HTL MEVs were further subjected to 3D structure modeling.
