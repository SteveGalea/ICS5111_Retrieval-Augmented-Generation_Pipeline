{"summary": "HF is a leading cause of death, hospitalization, and rehospitalization worldwide. despite advances in the treatment of HF, the condition remains associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. in the united states, HF incidence approaches 10 per 1,000 of the population over 65 years of age. two Chinese herbal medicines, ginseng and aconite root, are used in treating HF over 2000 years. ginseng invigorates qi while prepared aconite root can warm and strengthen yang and lead to diuresis. ginsenosides can improve ischemic myocardium metabolism, scavenge free radicals, protect myocardial ultrastructure, and reduce Ca2+ overload. randomized controlled trails (RCTs) of SFI compared with routine or conventional treatment were included. both acute heart failure and chronic heart failure were included. results include clinical effect rate, death and adverse events, ultrasonic cardiography, heart rate and blood pressure, and quality of life. Dichotomous data was presented as risk ratio (RR), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) continuous outcomes were presented as mean difference (MD), with 95% CI. analyses were performed by intention-to-treat where possible. nonrandomized evaluations, pharmacokinetic studies, animal/laboratory studies, and general reviews were excluded. duplicated publications reporting the same groups of patients were also excluded. the methodological quality of trials was assessed by using criteria from the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. 6 studies with full text papers were excluded because of duplicated publication. 4 studies were excluded because the reported groups were same as previous trials. 97 RCTs were included for systematic review. other parameters such as left ventricular diastolic diameter (LVDd), cardiac output (CO), cardiac index (CI), stroke volume (SV) and A peak E-wave velocity ratio (E/A) were reported in 16, 17, 20, 18, and 11 trials. NT-proBNP level in blood was reported in 12 studies of 887 patients.

NT-proBNP level is used for screening and diagnosis of acute HF. it may be useful to establish prognosis in HF, as it is typically higher in patients with worse outcome. NT-proBNP levels of SFI group were significantly lower than control group. LVEF is the ratio of the stroke volume and the left ventricular end-diastolic volume [107] it is usually used for the assessment of HF and drug efficacy. SV is the volume per stroke by left ventricle, and CO is the volume of blood being pumped by the heart in the time interval of one minute. LVDd is the end-diastolic dimension of the left ventricle. there was no statistical significance between SFI combined with conventional medicine treatment and conventional medicine treatment groups. no statistical significance between SFI combined with conventional medicine treatment and conventional medicine treatment groups. higenamine is the active ingredient of prepared aconite root. 202 studies with full text papers were retrieved. 84 studies were excluded because the reported groups were same as previous trials. 49 trials were observed in inpatients, 5 outpatients [22\u201326], 5 both inpatients and outpatients [27\u201331], and 39 unclear. all studies were published in Chinese. Mortality was reported in eleven studies, while the rest of the eighty eight trials did not mention death.

SV (WMD: 7.25; 95% CI [4.60, 9.90], P 0.01); CO (WMD: 0.67; 95% CI [0.47, 0.87], P 0.01); CI (WMD: 0.36; 95% CI [0.23, 0.48], P 0.01) (Supplementary Figure 8). trials of myocardial infarction-induced HF and nonmyocardial infarction-induced HF were separated into two subgroups. the meta-analysis showed a total significant difference between SFI and control groups on total effect rate. and significant difference appeared in both subgroups separately. NT-proBNP levels of SFI group were significantly lower than control group. at the end of treatment, eight trails all showed significant increase in walking distance. v is the volume per stroke by left ventricle, and CO is the volume of blood being pumped by the heart in the time interval of one minute. results showed that SFI group was better than control group in these three parameters: SV (WMD: 6.31; 95% CI [5.18, 7.44], P 0.01) 3.6. Adverse Effect Thirty seven out of ninety seven trials mentioned the adverse effect except in sixty-two trials which was unclear. dry mouth and fullness of the head were reported in 4 trails with 14 and 10 cases, respectively. western medicine has made tremendous progress and has become the dominating medical treatment worldwide. however, it has been increasingly recognized that western medicine may sometimes fail to treat an illness, whereas such illness is reportedly improved by the so-called complementary medicine based on a different theory. LVEF, CO, CI, SV, LVDd, and NT-proBNP were reviewed by us. there was significant difference between systolic and diastolic functions of heart. but it did not have significant effect on expansion of heart. only eleven studies out of ninety seven trials reported death, and most of the eleven trials assessed mortality at the end of treatment, without followup. only 37.4% of the trials described the occurrence of adverse events, indicating an incomplete evaluation of the safety profile of SFI, and poor quality of reporting. china publishes high proportions of positive results. all of the ninety seven trials were published in Chinese. none of the ninety seven trials reported sample size calculation. there were no significant difference in LVDd (WMD: 1.59; 95% CI [-5.29, 2.12], P=0.40), systolic blood pressure (WMD: 0.07; 95%CI [0.42, 0.27], P=0.68) between routine treatment groups."}
