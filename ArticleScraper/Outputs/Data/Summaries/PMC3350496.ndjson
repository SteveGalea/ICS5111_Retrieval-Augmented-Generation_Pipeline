{"summary": "de-novo transcriptome sequencing of normalized cDNA libraries constructed from tissues or cells allows for full or partial determination of transcribed genes. the ferret has become an important model for studies of infectious diseases, such as influenza virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and canine distemper virus [13]\u2013[20]. cDNA library was constructed using tissues from animals infected with influenza virus as well as ferret splenocytes induced with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to allow for identification of Gram-negative pattern recognition receptors such as toll-like receptor 4. 51076 contigs showed alignment to proteins or RNA sequences in the RefSeq RNA or protein databases. the most overrepresented biological functions describe general cellular functions, such as cellular process (GO:0009987), metabolic process (GO:0008125) and gene expression (GO:0010467) as we infected the animals prior to the harvest of the tissues, we expected an enrichment of genes known to be induced during different stages of early infection. ldehyde dehydrogenase gene (AASDH), where some contigs show the highest overlap to the AASDH gene from giant panda. other contigs are more similar to the dog ortholog. a large number of these genes were represented by two or more non-overlapping contigs. more than 7000 contigs showed high similarity to LINE-1 reverse transcriptase. more than 7000 contigs showed high similarity to LINE-1 reverse transcriptase and were removed from functional analysis. most overrepresented gene-annotation categories from the enrichment analysis were of a more general type. GS-FLX titanium platform allows for longer sequence reads than other comparable platforms. the longer reads allow for accurate assemblies with fewer gaps, longer contigs and better assignment of repeat regions. the longer reads allow for accurate assemblies with fewer gaps, longer contigs and better assignment of repeat regions. ortholog of the T-cell surface glycoprotein CD5 is a transmembrane protein expressed constitutively on the surface of T cells and a subset of B cells [31]. a partial transcript of more than 1000 base pairs showed high resemblance to the CD5 ortholog genes in several other species, including panda, dog, horse and cow. two males and two females were infected with 104 TCID50/ml influenza. one male and one female were euthanized on days three and six post-infection. RNA from blood was extracted using the PAX gene kit from Qiagen. cDNA pool was reverse-transcribed to cDNA that was normalized prior to sequencing to avoid sequencing of abundantly expressed transcripts. assembly was done with iAssembler (version: v1.3) using default settings. we used a more stringent analysis (MegaBlast) and regular blast to annotate the contigs. the contigs aligned with human nucleotide and/or protein sequences using the megaBlast algorithm are shown in Table S2. the searches against the human databases enabled functional analysis using the database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery. \u201cRefSeq RNA_acc\u201d points to the accession number from the RefSeq RNA blast analysis, using all RNA in the GenBank database. the nucleotide sequence for each contigs is displayed in the column denoted \u201cSequence.\u201d (XLSX) The nucleotide sequence for each contigs is displayed in the column denoted \u201cSequence.\u201d (XLSX) Click here for additional data file. table S3 Ferret sequence of genes in immune system process (GO:002376) indicates the human gene Symbol, the protein description and the accession number from the RefSeq RNA blast analysis."}
