{"summary": "AFOP is an uncommon type of acute lung injury associated with infection, connective tissue disorders, drug exposure, and hematologic malignancies. a 53-year-old female presented with intermittent fever, chills, and dry cough since 10 days. case report A 53-year-old female was hospitalized in October 2017 with chief complaints of intermittent fever, chills, and cough since 10 days. prior to her admission, she had received penicillin, cephalosporins and azithromycin. she developed painful round, slightly raised, and nonulcerative red nodules over the extensor aspect of the right calf. despite the treatment, the patient's clinical status worsened with no remission of fever. results of blood culture, 1-3-d-glucan, and galactomannan (GM) tests were negative. patients with acute and severe AFOP show a clinical course similar to those with DAD and typically have a poor prognosis. AFOP is associated with several conditions such as rheumatologic disease, infections, drug reaction, environmental exposure, connective tissue disease, and lung transplantation. AFOP was classified as a rare histologic pattern of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias in 2013. the main clinical manifestations are cough, respiratory distress, asthma-like symptoms, and chest tightness. a definitive diagnosis of AFOP requires histopathologic evaluation. a diagnosis of idiopathic AFOP in patients with lung consolidation and occupying lesions requires exclusion of other types of lesions. AFOP was mistakenly diagnosed in a patient with tuberculosis and the inherent tuberculosis finally progressed to severe bilateral diffuse military tuberculosis owing to the use of steroids. YW, YL, and QW wrote the manuscript and prepared figures. CZ conceived of the study, and participated in its design and coordination."}
