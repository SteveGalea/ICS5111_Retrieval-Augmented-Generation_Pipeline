{"summary": "232 fecal samples or CPV isolates were obtained from dogs with diarrhea in Italy (n = 107), Germany (n = 37), the United Kingdom (n = 41), Portugal (n = 41), Belgium (n = 13), Spain (n = 1), Switzerland (n = 1), and the Czech Republic (n = 1). CPV-positive results from laboratories located in the countries of sample origin were confirmed by TaqMan assay to contain CPV DNA. in Italy, a nearly complete substitution of CPV-2b by CPV-2c was noted; CPV-2a strains were found at low frequency. CPV-2b is still prevalent in Germany and Portugal. CPV-2c, which emerged in Italy in 2000 (2), is spreading with high efficiency in the dog population of Italy and progressively replacing the antigenic variants 2a and 2b (3\u20135) the new variant 2c is widespread in some European countries (Italy, Portugal, and Germany) and that it could be detected sporadically in the United Kingdom. CPV vaccines currently used provide full protection against the new variant. another question is whether they should be replaced by homologous vaccines."}
