{"summary": "in 2005, more than 200 new virus species were submitted to GenBank. the origin of most major infectious diseases is unknown because of our ignorance of the diversity of pathogens in wild animals. this restricts our ability to predict risks and develop treatments. the RNA Virus Database is intended to complement these other sites by providing basic genomic information and tools for all RNA viruses. we provide links to sites such as the Los Alamos Laboratory on the main page for each of these viruses. for such viruses, we do not duplicate work of other groups by attempting to display the available diversity of genomes. Virus Database is a user-friendly site devoted to RNA viruses. provides multiple whole-genome alignments, gene and whole-genome translations for all species where GenBank contains multiple representatives. FigTree will also display strain and isolate information as well as accession numbers. a BLAST of the query to the reference species sequence provides coordinates from the resulting pair-wise alignment. the query sequence can then be placed into a whole-genome multiple alignment for that species. a new multiple alignment is then built using a phylogenetic tree. the translated genomes are intended to facilitate phylogenetic analysis of more distantly related viruses (9) most species have some gene overlap (17), i.e. where the same nucleotides code for two different genes by being read in two different frames. we allow the user to select from three possible options for dealing with this feature. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez\"db=nucleotide Species names, nucleotide sequences and accession numbers were downloaded directly from GenBank using BioPerl modules. further details of the virus\u2014gene coordinates, taxonomic affinities etc.\u2014were subsequently extracted from the flatfile of all GenBank entries that can be downloaded from the NCBI Genome site (19). we intend to update the database on at least a 6-monthly basis to include newly discovered viruses. we are currently working to incorporate biological and epidemiological data."}
