{"summary": "study was undertaken to know the viral aetiology of wheezing among the children less than five years of age. seventy five children, under the age of five years admitted with wheezing, were included in the study. children admitted to the paediatric ward and the PICU with wheezing were selected consecutively as the study patients for virological investigations. exclusion criteria were children above the age of five years, those presenting with or developing status asthmaticus and children whose parents did not provide consent for inclusion. the nasopharyngeal and throat swabs collected from 70 children were sent for viral diagnosis by multiplex real-time PCR assay (ABI 7500, USA) samples were collected within 24 h of admission and sent to the laboratory immediately in viral transport medium in ice packs. children, 56 (75%) were male. Cough was the main presenting complaint (93%, n=70), followed by nasal discharge and respiratory distress (74%, n=55) and fever (64%, n=48) additional symptoms such as watering of the eyes and skin rashes were seen in 71 per cent of children. the viral isolation rate was 28.57 per cent comparable to the study by Chanock et al15 on respiratory infection in 10 countries. RSV was the single most common virus isolated and accounted for 30-70 per cent of cases in Indian studies16,17,18. HBoV infection produced only mild symptoms in our study. HBoV was found to cause severe hypoxia requiring hospitalization. influenza virus was isolated and reported as a common viral pathogen causing severe disease in children under five years of age."}
