{"summary": "nerve blockade is often performed as therapeutic or palliative interventions for pain relief, especially for chronic pain. ganglion impair block appears to be more effective than conservative therapy in resistant patients, 82% achieve at least 50% relief of pain after the first treatment. the addition of dexamethasone to local anesthetics prolongs brachial plexus block. even low-dose dexamethasone (1\u20132 mg) would prolong analgesia duration and motor blockade. the rabbits were placed in the left lying position, positioned, and medicated into the intergroove of right greater psoas muscle. one needle punctured 2\u20132.5 cm so as to break through the intertransverse ligament and enter the intergroove of right greater psoas muscle. group A1: 2.5 ml 2 times, group A2 2.5 ml 4 times, group B1 5 ml 2 times, and group B2 5 ml 4 times, with the injection interval is 5 days. detecting indexes One optical microscopy was sued to observe the right femoral head chondrocytic (FHC) the position accuracy using X-ray, 1 ml of iohexol was then injected, and then computed tomography (CT) was performed to check the distribution of the contrast agent within the intergroove of right greater psoas muscle. another three rabbits were then selected and performed the positioning using the same method. one optical microscopy was sued to observe the right femoral head chondrocytic (FHC) group A1 and A2, B1 and B2, A1 and B1, and A2 and B2 were performed statistical X2 analysis. the counting data were analyzed using the t test. the chondrocytic column was arranged regularly; the trabecular thickness and morphology were normal and closely connected; the osteoblasts and osteoclasts\u2019 size, shape, number, and arrangement were normal. the structure of bone marrow was normal, and the cell proportion and component composition showed no abnormality. ification exhibited abnormality; epiphyseal plate thickness was moderately thinned; chondrocytic size, shape, number, and arrangement were normal; no cartilage growth or ossification exhibited abnormality. a small part of trabecular bone exhibited mild atrophy, and the connection was moderately loose. the structure of bone marrow was normal, and the cell proportion and component composition showed no abnormality. or ossification exhibited abnormality; local epiphyseal plate thickness was slightly thinned; the chondrocytic column was slightly disordered; the trabecular thickness and morphology were normal and closely connected; the osteoblasts\u2019 size, shape, number, and arrangement were slightly disordered; the structure of bone marrow was normal; the cell proportion and component composition showed no abnormality. hte exhibited normal structures, smooth surface, uniform thickness, normal chondrocytic size, shape, number, and arrangement. no cartilage growth or ossification exhibited abnormality. chondrocytic column was arranged regularly; structure of bone marrow was normal. becular bone exhibited mild atrophy, and the connection was moderately loose. structure of bone marrow was normal, and cell proportion and component composition showed no abnormality. chondrocytic size, shape, number, and arrangement were normal. the chondrocytic column was arranged regularly; the trabecular thickness and morphology were normal and closely connected; the osteoblasts and osteoclasts\u2019 size, shape, number, and arrangement were normal. no cartilage growth or ossification exhibited abnormality; the structure of bone marrow was normal; the cell proportion and component composition showed no abnormality. discussion Nerve block has achieved good results in treating chronic pain. it is being used increasingly as a therapy for chronic pain. a mixture of local anesthetic and corticosteroid for the treatment of refractory cancer-related pain was acceptable and effective. glucocorticoids in lumbosacral plexus nerve block cause femoral head necrosis. it\u2019s still unknown whether glucocorticoids in lumbosacral plexus nerve block would cause damages in femur. it\u2019s still unknown whether it can cause damages to the articular cartilage inside the innervation area. inflammatory and analgesic effects of added glucocorticoids are transported around inflammatory tissues via nerve axonal motions. TRI can reach the articular cartilage by an unknown route, and then cause cartilage damages."}
