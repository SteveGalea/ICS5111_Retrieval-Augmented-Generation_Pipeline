Principles Electrochemistry implies the transfer of charge from an electrode to another phase, which can be a solid or a liquid sample. both the electrode reactions and the charge transport can be modulated chemically and serve as the basis of the sensing process [9]. ive electrode (ISE) for the measurement of electrolytes is a common potentiometric sensor. the membrane can be either a solid (i.e., glass, inorganic crystal) or a plasticized polymer. the ISE composition is chosen in order to impart a potential that is primarily associated with the ion of interest via a selective binding process at the membrane-electrolyte interface. the measured cell current (diffusion current) is a quantitative measure of the analyte of interest. there are three so-called \u201cgenerations\u201d of biosensors: first generation biosensors where the normal product of the reaction diffuses to the transducer. second generation biosensors where the reaction itself causes the response and no product or mediator diffusion is directly involved. the amount of charge passing between the electrodes is directly proportional to oxidation or reduction of an electroactive substance at one of the electrodes. the number of coulombs transferred in this process is related to the absolute amount of electroactive substance by Faraday's Law. principles Electrochemistry implies the transfer of charge from an electrode to another phase, which can be a solid or a liquid sample. both the electrode reactions and/or the charge transport can be modulated chemically and serve as the basis of the sensing process [9]. entiometric sensor comprises a membrane with a unique composition. the membrane can be either a solid (i.e., glass, inorganic crystal) or a plasticized polymer. the ISE composition is chosen to impart a potential that is primarily associated with the ion of interest via a selective binding process at the membrane-electrolyte interface. the measured cell current (diffusion current) is a quantitative measure of the analyte of interest. there are three so-called \u201cgenerations\u201d of biosensors: first generation biosensors where the normal product of the reaction diffuses to the transducer and causes the electrical response. second generation biosensors where the reaction itself causes the response and no product or mediator diffusion is directly involved. the number of coulombs transferred in this process is related to the absolute amount of electroactive substance by Faraday's Law. the potential difference between the reference electrode and the indicator electrode is measured without polarizing the electrochemical cell. the change in potential is related to concentration in a logarithmic manner. ion-selective polymeric membranes are deposited directly onto solid electrode surfaces with no internal electrolyte solution. amperometry is a method of electrochemical analysis in which the signal of interest is a current that is linearly dependent upon the concentration of the analyte. first generation amperometric biosensors, second generation amperometric biosensors. other types of electrochemical measurements Conductometric sensors are based on the measurement of electrolyte conductivity, which varies when the cell is exposed to different environments. microfabrication route offers high-volume production of extremely inexpensive and yet highly reproducible disposable enzyme electrodes. most of these advantages are derived from the small sample and reagent volume used in these systems. glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) was applied to glucose sensors. electrochemical reactions using electron transfer mediator are as follows. technique used to immobilize enzyme is one of the key factors. ionic liquid-methylimidazolium hexafluophosphate providing a unique microenvironment for the immobilization of GOx [26], hexagonal mesoporous silica adsorbing GOx retained its bioactivity and stability [27]. LB films had been employed for the immobilization of GOx, since the very thin nature in nanoscale might produce a highly sensitive sensor. carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can be used as electrode materials with useful properties for various potential applications including miniature biological devices. soluble carbon nanofiber was used to modify a glucose sensor, which performed the electroreduction of dissolved oxygen at a low operating potential. amperometric sensor based on polypyrrole nanotube array deposited on a nano-porous alumina substrate was described. polypyrrole nanofibers containing entrapped GOx showed good biocatalytic activity to glucose. quinoprotein GDH (EC 1.1.99.17) uses pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) as a cofactor. some mediators have been involved, such as ferroncene and its derivatives. some mediators have been involved, such as phenazine methosulfate and benzoquinone. new nonenzymatic glucose sensors were developed using nano-materials. the electrodes could be used for the development of enzyme free glucose sensors. the nanosized Au particles have been self-assembled on the silicate network. the reverse iontophoresis application has led to the development of the GlucoWatch Biographer. it provides frequent, automatic, and non-invasive glucose readings for diabetic patients. the device can provide glucose readings every 20 minutes for 12 hours. the glucoWatch must be calibrated with a blood sample prior to use. the iontophoretically extracted glucose flux reflected the glucose concentration profiles in the blood. application of ultrasound has been shown to enhance transdermal transport of various drugs including macromolecules. 68 sensors were implanted with 60 associated devices in 22 Sprague-Dawley outbred rats. average sensor lifetime was 11.2 3.1 days with a maximum of 56 days. some researchers used horseradish peroxidase to measure hydrogen peroxide reduction current at lower potential. the structure-dependent metallic character of CNTs should allow them to promote heterogeneous electron-transfer reactions at low over-potentials. enzyme was entrapped in polypyrrole and polyaniline. entrapped only ChOx within polypyrrole/poly(-phenylenediamine) bilayer. entrapped electron transfer mediator, ferrocene monocarboxylic acid. uric acid Uric acid (UA), a major nitrogenous compound in urine, is the product of purine metabolism in the human body. high levels of UA in the blood are linked with gout and other conditions including increased alcohol consumption, obesity, diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, kidney disease and heart disease. electrochemical interferences such as ascorbic acid (AA) present at high concentrations in biological systems. a self-assembled monolayer of n-octanethiolate (OT/Au) and L--phosphatidylcholine -oleoyl-palmitoyl was coated on the Au electrode. another redox polymer, poly(N-methyl-o-phenylenediamine) as the mediator and another self-assembled monolayer of 2-aminoethanethiolate was studied. high selectivity and sensitivity at 1000 V/s allow the determinations of low concentrations of UA in the presence of high concentrations of AA at a carbon fiber electrode without a permselective film. the response of sensor showed a stable UA oxidation peak, even if AA interfered. the level of lactic acid in blood is used in clinical diagnostics of hypoxia, lactic acidosis, some acute heart diseases and drug toxicity tests. based microelectrode array [146] or nontronite-coated carbon electrodes were also reported [147]. tate oxidase was used to covalently attach to an electropolymerized copolymer film. a novel chitosan/polyvinylimidazole-Os/CNTs/lactate oxidase network nanocomposite was constructed on Au electrode for detection of lactate. enzymatic approaches mostly use NAD+-dependent lactate dehydrogenase from animal muscles or heart. a noninvasive sensor was designed to detect lactate in an electrolyte solution of artificial sweat by Weber et al.

[152] to modify a lactate electrode. enzymatic approaches mostly use NAD+-dependent lactate dehydrogenase from animal muscles or heart (EC 1.1.1.27), or bacterial lactate oxidase (EC 1.13.12.4). a noninvasive sensor was designed to detect lactate in an electrolyte solution of artificial sweat by Weber et al. the counter electrode is the anode electrode, where oxidation takes place. the current output can be calibrated linearly with respect to the dissolved oxygen. dissolved CO2 gas in solution diffuses into the internal electrolyte. the output current was varied from \u20136.2 A to \u20137.8 A within 2 min when the concentration of inhaled oxygen was changed from atmospheric air to 60% oxygen. they also developed a thinner, smaller and flexible oxygen sensor as one of the Soft-MEMS devices. pO2, pCO2, pH, electrolytes, glucose and lactate in vivo have not become widely used in clinical practice. recently, local release of NO at the sensor/blood interface has been suggested as a potential solution to this problem. sensors coated with polymer can release NO continuously at levels >110-10 mol/cm2min for more than 20 hours. the partial pressure can be related to the pH of the sample since H2CO3 dissociates into H+ and HCO3. the pH change is directly related to pCO2 and the activity of the sodium ion by: pH = lg K 1 p C O 2 Na + where K1 is the dissociation constant. a KCl electrolyte solution with a nonpermeable membrane and gas-permeable membrane with Pt and Ag/AgCl electrode patterned by using photolithography and sputtering methods. an ISFET based transcutaneous pCO2 sensor was fabricated by Han et al. with a solid reference electrode, hydrogel-containing electrolyte and a CO2 gas-permeable membrane. mer can release NO continuously at levels >110-10 mol/cm2min for more than 20 hours. control sensors (non-NO release) implanted within the same animals showed a high propensity for cell adhesion and bulk clot formation. i-STAT has commercialized handheld biochemical device for point-of-care use with disposable biochips that detect blood gases, pH, pCO2, pO2; electrolytes, Na+, K+, Ca2+, Cl-, Mg2+; metabolites, glucose, urea, lactate; etc. the Severinghaus design is a Severinghaus design, the O2 electrode is an amperometric Clark electrode design, glucose sensors are based on an iridium film RF sputterd and patterned by lift-off. hematocrit is measured using AC conductimetry [170, 171]. tDNA was oxidased electrochemically on carbon, Au, indium tin oxide and polymer coated electrodes. a DNA electrochemical sensor was described for electrochemical impedance spectroscopy detection. nanogold and zirconia were used to immobilize the ssDNA. electroactive indicators binding preferentially to dsDNA, hybridization and labeling of tDNA or signaling (reporter) oligodeoxynucleotide probes. the target anchored is detected by indicator, which can produce electrochemical signal. a hybridization indicator, bis(benzimidazole)cadmium(II) dinitrate, was used to develop an electrochemical DNA sensor. copolymers bearing both ferrocene redox markers and oligonucleotide probes were selectively electro-addressed on microchip electrodes. the first step, the hybridization was efficiently transduced through the variation of ferrocene oxidation intensity. the target is anchored to the sensor surface by the capture probe and detected by hybridization with a detector probe linked to a reporter function. RPs for monitoring hybridization of DNA can be subdivided in two groups. electroactive, such as metal complexes, and non-electroactive, such as enzymes. an Au complex was used as electroactive label
