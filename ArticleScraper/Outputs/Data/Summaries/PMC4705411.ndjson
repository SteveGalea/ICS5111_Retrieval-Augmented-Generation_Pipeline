{"summary": "eukaryotic cells use tightly regulated pathways to sort and degrade internalized cargo by exploiting lysosomal proteases, the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and endoplasmic reticulum. ER-associated degradation, or ERAD, involves extraction and ubiquitination of misfolded proteins followed by their degradation by the proteasomal machinery. glycans such as heparan sulfate, sialic acid, or galactose are thought to be mediated by integrins and/or specific transmembrane receptors. despite these differences, perinuclear accumulation within the Golgi apparatus (14\u201318) and exploitation of the nuclear import machinery for nuclear entry appear to be broadly conserved, downstream trafficking events (19) human fibroblasts (AG05244) were maintained in modified Eagle's medium. all cells were maintained at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2. anti-capsid protein antibody B1 (24) was used to blot for capsid protein. 9281), nicardipine (N7510), spautin-1 (SML0440) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.

MG132 (10012628) was obtained from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI) baculovirus delivering Emerald Green GFP (emGFP)-tagged Rab7a (late endosomal marker, C10588) and LAMP1 (lysosomal marker, C10596) were obtained from Life Technologies. cells were plated on slide covers in 24-well plates at a density of 5 104 cells/well and allowed to adhere overnight. cells were then treated with EerI 4 h before incubation with AAV2 at 50,000 vg/cell. cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 8 h. cells were stained with primary antibody overnight at 4 \u00b0C. then stained with secondary antibody for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. imaged using a Zeiss 710 scanning confocal microscope. mice anti-VCP (ab11433), rabbit anti-VCP (ab109240) and mouse anti-actin (ab3280) antibodies were obtained from Abcam (Cambridge, MA) Rabbit anti-EEA1 (C45B10) and rabbit anti-Golgin97 (D8P2K) were obtained from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA) transduction and cell viability assays Cells were plated at a density of 5 104 cells/well in 24-well plates and allowed to adhere overnight. cell viability was assayed using the cellTiter Glo\u00ae luminescent cell viability assay system from Promega. cells being used to monitor viral uptake were transferred to 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. cells were triedpsinized and washed three times with PBS to remove all un-internalized virions. cells were plated on 24-well plates at a density of 5 104 cells/well and allowed to adhere overnight. a higher coefficient represents greater colocalization of AAV particles with the corresponding subcellular marker. a two-tailed student t test was used for all statistical analysis. luciferase reporter expression in HeLa cells pretreated with vehicle controls. effect of proteasome inhibitors MG132 (10 m), bortezomib (500 nm), pan-deubiquitinase inhibitor PR-619 (5 m), or UBE1 inhibitor, PYR-41 (50 m) is shown. luciferase expression in HeLa cells transfected with the pTR-CBA-Luc plasmid and treated with various concentrations of EerI 48 h post-transfection. we observed no change in fLuc expression as result of EerI treatment. cells were pretreated with DMSO control or EerI and then transduced with either single-stranded ssAAV2-GFP vectors or self-complementary scAAV2-GFP vectors. cells were fixed 24 h and imaged using confocal microscopy. FP reporter cassettes show that EerI increases transduction regardless of capsid, second strand synthesis, or cell type. we incubated the cells with AAV2 particles, followed by immunofluorescent labeling of AAV capsids and VCP at 2, 4 or 8 h post-incubation. cells were fixed at 2 h (A), 4 h (B) and 8 h (C), immunostained for VCP (green) and AAV2 capsid (magenta) as outlined under \u201cMaterials and Methods,\u201d and counterstained with DAPI (blue). white inset boxes indicate areas imaged at higher magnification. a statistically significant increase in Pearson's coefficients was noted for redistribution of AAV particles to Rab7 and LAMP1+ vesicles. confocal micrographs of HeLa cells infected with BacMam baculovirus encoding for GFP-Rab7a (A) or GFP-LAMP1 (B) EerI treatment does not alter the number of bound virions attached to the cell surface or internalized virions at 1 h post-incubation. further evidence supporting the notion that EerI influences a downstream step in the AAV trafficking pathway was obtained by treating cells at different time intervals. cells incubated with AAV particles at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h were washed to remove unbound virions and then shifted to 37 \u00b0C for 1 h to allow cellular uptake. internalized virions were quantitated by quantitative PCR. MG132 treatment leads to more disseminated capsid accumulation in vesicles. proteasomal inhibition is thought to directly enhance AAV transduction by preventing capsid degradation in the cytosol. however, no differences in recovered vg were observed at early time intervals up to 4 h. Eeyarestatin I Increases AAV Transduction Small molecule inhibitors that augment cellular degradation mechanisms have been used extensively to dissect virus-host interactions. we first treated HeLa cells with various small molecules that modulate the cellular ubiquitin proteasome system. we then incubated the cells with AAV2-CBA-fLuc. we used three additional VCP inhibitors, ML240, NMS-873, or DBeQ (N2N4-dibezylquinazoline-2,4-diamine) to recapitulate these results. however, none of the VCP inhibitors increased AAV transduction with the exception of EerI. luciferase reporter expression in HeLa cells pretreated with vehicle control, 1 m ML240, 1 m NMS-873, 10 m DBeQ, or 10 m EerI was transduced with AAV2-Luc. cells were fixed 24 h and imaged using confocal microscopy. we observed a dose-dependent increase of AAV transduction at EerI concentrations up to 15 m. at an optimal EerI concentration of 10 m, we observed a uniformly beneficial effect on transduction efficiency in HeLa cells. we investigated whether varying AAV capsid types or cell types affected the ability of EerI to enhance transduction. confocal fluorescence microscopy studies showed no significant correlation between intracellular patterns of VCP and AAV capsid immunostaining at 2, 4 or 8 h post-incubation. a steady increase in the perinuclear accumulation of AAV particles was observed over time. AAV particles did not appear to colocalize with EEA1+ vesicles. at 8 h post-incubation, AAV particles did not appear to colocalize with EEA1+ vesicles. this increased colocalization was confirmed by quantitation of fluorescent signal. cells were pretreated with DMSO or EerI at 72 h post-plating. cells were then fixed at 8 h, immunostained for AAV capsid (magenta) and counterstained with DAPI (blue) white inset boxes indicate areas imaged at higher magnification. EerI treatment does not alter the number of bound virions attached to the cell surface nor internalized virions at 1 h post-incubation. further evidence supporting the notion that EerI influences a downstream step in the AAV trafficking pathway was obtained by treating cells at different time intervals before or after viral incubation. confocal micrographs of HeLa cells pretreated with EerI or MG132. cells were fixed at 8 h, immunostained for AAV capsids (magenta) and counterstained with DAPI (blue) a striking increase in the number of AAV genomes recovered after synchronized cellular uptake at later time intervals. no differences in recovered vg were observed at early time intervals up to 4 h. as much as 80\u201390% of AAV genomes was recovered at 16\u201324 h upon treatment with EerI in contrast to 25\u201335% of AAV genomes obtained from untreated cells. proteasome, MG132 and bortezomib, increased transduction by approximately a log order. neither the autophagy inducer, nicardipine nor the autophagy inhibitor, spautin-1 altered AAV transduction. however, neither the autophagy inducer, nicardipine nor the autophagy inhibitor, spautin-1 altered AAV transduction. we used three additional VCP inhibitors, ML240, NMS-873, or DBeQ (N2N4-dibezylquinazoline-2,4-diamine) to recapitulate these results. but none of the VCP inhibitors increased AAV transduction with the exception of EerI. c, HeLa cells pretreated with various concentrations of EerI and transduced with AAV2-Luc (gray bars) or subjected to a CellTiter-Glo assay to determine cell viability (circles) d, HeLa cells pretreated with either DMSO control (squares) or EerI (triangles) and transduced with AAV2-Luc at increasing vector genome copies (vg) per cell. optimal EerI concentration of 10 m, we observed a uniformly beneficial effect on transduction efficiency in HeLa cells over a broad range of viral doses ranging from 10 to 10,000 vg/cell. varying AAV capsid types or cell types affected the ability of EerI to enhance transduction. we investigated whether varying AAV capsid types or cell types affected the ability of EerI to enhance transduction. a steady increase in the perinuclear accumulation of AAV particles was observed over time. at 8 h post-incubation we observed a majority of AAV particles redistributed from the perinuclear space to a large and dispersed punctate pattern throughout the cytoplasm. markers, specifically Rab7 (late endosome) and LAMP1 (lysosome) using baculoviral expression vectors. at 8 h post-incubation, AAV particles did not appear to colocalize with EEA1+ vesicles. this increased colocalization was further confirmed by quantitation of fluorescent signal using the ImageJ software as described under \u201cMaterials and Methods\u201d. subcellular marker DMSO EerI p value EEA1 0.198 0.018 0.252 0.040 n.s Rab7a 0.216 0.019 0.342 0.024 *, p 0.05 LAMP1 0.269 0.036 0.439 0.025 *, p 0.05 Golgin97 0.379 0.025 0.312 0.032 n.s STX5 0.453 0.009 0.334 0.042 n.s. by 8 h post-AAV incubation, the addition of EerI increased transduction efficiency by less than 1.5-fold. confocal fluorescence data suggest that EerI treatment alters the endocytic sorting of AAV particles after cellular uptake, but prior to nuclear entry. luciferase expression in HeLa cells pretreated with DMSO, EerI, MG132, or EerI and MG132 in combination and transduced with AAV2-Luc. at 4 h post-incubation, the drugs and virus were removed and replaced with fresh prewarmed medium. as much as 80\u201390% of AAV genomes were recovered at 16\u201324 h upon treatment with EerI. this contrasts to 25\u201335% of AAV genomes obtained from untreated cells. to assess this possibility, cells were co-treated with EerI and MG132, alone or in combination. these studies were optimized to minimize combined cytotoxicity arising from dual drug treatment. neither the autophagy inducer, nicardipine nor the autophagy inhibitor, spautin-1 altered AAV transduction. we then tested ERAD using two inhibitors, EerI and kifunensine (Kif) the effect seen exclusively affects AAV transduction in a serotype-, cell type-, and vector genome-independent manner. the effect seen exclusively affects AAV transduction in a serotype-, cell type-, and vector genome-independent manner. la cells were pretreated with either DMSO control (squares) or EerI (triangles) and transduced with various AAV serotypes packaging the Luc transgene cassette. F, HepG2, Huh7, and human fibroblasts (hFibroblast) were pretreated with EerI at concentrations individually optimized to limit cytotoxicity. we investigated this possibility by incubating HeLa cells with numerous AAV serotypes at 1,000 vg/cell. EerI uniformly increases the transduction of all serotypes tested, although at varying levels. further, we determined that EerI enhances the intensity of GFP reporter gene expression mediated by AAV vectors packaging single-stranded (ss) or self-complementary (sc). a majority of AAV particles redistributed from the perinuclear space to a large and dispersed punctate pattern throughout the cytoplasm upon VCP inhibition. this observation strikingly contrasts with DMSO-treated cells, in which AAV virions remain concentrated in the perinuclear region. Pearson's coefficients were noted for redistribution of AAV particles to Rab7 and LAMP1+ vesicles. a statistically significant increase was noted for redistribution of AAV particles to Rab7 and vesicles. subcellular marker DMSO EerI p value EEA1 0.198 0.018 0.252 0.040 n.s Rab7a 0.216 0.019 0.342 0.024 *, p 0.05 LAMP1 0.269 0.036 0.439 0.025 *, p 0.05 Golgin97 0.379 0.025 0.312 0.032 n.s STX5 0.453 0.009 0.334 0.042 n.s. luciferase expression in HeLa cells treated with DMSO or MG132. cells were fixed at 8 h, immunostained for AAV capsids (magenta) and counterstained with DAPI (blue) at 4 h post-incubation, the drugs and virus were removed and replaced with fresh prewarmed medium. MG132 treatment leads to a more disseminated capsid accumulation. proteasomal inhibition is thought to directly enhance AAV transduction by preventing capsid degradation in the cytosol. combined drug treatment was synergistic and enhanced AAV transduction by nearly 15-fold. results demonstrate that cellular degradation pathways can influence AAV infection in distinct ways. treatment with this drug delayed trafficking of Shiga toxin to the perinuclear region and the Golgi. erI treatment is consistent with earlier studies demonstrating that AAV transport through Rab7+ late endosomes/lysosomes is highly productive due to their high motility and faster retrograde velocities. such a scenario is possible due to the low pH and high protease activity within such vesicles that could more effectively prime the AAV capsid (38) by exposing the VP1 phospholipase A2 domain (39) and nuclear localization signals (40). endosome-to-lysosome transport as well as retrograde transport from early endosomes to the Golgi leading to perinuclear accumulation. in cells treated with EerI, virions appear to accumulate within Rab7a/Lamp1+ vesicles instead of a perinuclear pattern due to an unknown mechanism. attempts to modulate AAV transduction by using other small molecule VCP inhibitors were unsuccessful. the effective dose and toxicity of such agents will need to be determined in preclinical animal models as well as the clinic prior to potential applications in the gene therapy setting. authors G.
