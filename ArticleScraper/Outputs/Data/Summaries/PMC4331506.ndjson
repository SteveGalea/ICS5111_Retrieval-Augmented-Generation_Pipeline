{"summary": "broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) are widely thought to represent the best means of preventing HIV infection. many factors relating both to the characteristics of known bnAbs and the HIV virus have confounded efforts to induce bnAbs by vaccination. many bnAbs have greatly informed immunogen design. a yeast surface display (YSD) platform is required to implement directed molecular evolution principles to the development of candidate immunogens. the platform allows the display of millions of sequence variants and selection based on flexible design criteria to allow efficient and deep coverage of the envelope structure:function landscape. YSD allows the display of millions of sequence variants and selection based on flexible design criteria. yeast-displayed gp140 SOSIP variants demonstrate the feasibility of production of HIV envelope in yeast. YSD may prove a robust platform for rapid evolution and selection of promising vaccine immunogens. gp120 is trimmed to a human-like 5-mannose stem in engineered Pichia. the mannose-rich N-glycosylation in YVH10 is trimmed to a human-like 5-mannose stem. gp120 appeared somewhat more fragmented on a Western blot. gp120 fragments and full-length gp120 could be secreted at clearly detectable levels, but not full-length gp140. omission of fusion peptide clearly enhanced secretion of gp41. gp120 collapsed near expected MW of 52 kDa after treatment with N-glycosidase PNGase F. d-SOSIP variant was significantly N-glycosylated, and collapsed after PNGase F-treatment. d-SOSIP variant was significantly N-glycosylated, and collapsed after PNGase F-treatment. gp120 core epitopes are included in d-SOSIP, while gp120 core lacks many of the epitopes of d-SOSIP, including variable loop and gp41-associated epitopes. d-SOSIP constructs showed extremely low display levels as compared to the gp120 core. a library of 2.0x107 members was prepared to select for properly folded sequence variants of d-SOSIP. each library member containing an average of about 6.7 random amino acid mutations was extensively screened for improved binding. the pool of clones selected was further diversified to 7.7x107 members during two additional cycles of error prone PCR and repeated FACS selection for improved binding to either VRC01 (track 1) or against a pooled mix of the five CD4bs mAbs VRC01, PGV04, CH31, b12 and b6 (track 3) binding to CD4bs mAbs VRC01 and b6 as compared to the 3.3 pool selected before DNA shuffling. there was no difference in binding observed between tracks 1, 2 and 3. 20,000 yeast cells displaying no HIV envelope protein (-), d-SOSIP gp140 D368R (d-SOSIP D368R), d-SOSIP or selected pools after cycles C3.3 and C4.3. clones with the best VRC01 and least control mAb binding were further screened for broad recognition of conformational CD4bs mAbs PGV04 and b6. 4.3.B01 and 4.3.D01 are identical in the gp41 region. both 4.3.B01 and 4.3.D01 showed greatly improved binding to several CD4bs Abs, both neutralizing and non-neutralizing, and also V3 Ab F425 B4e8 and MPER Ab 2F5. mutations found in 4.3.B01 and 4.3.D01 cluster in a relatively narrow region within the V1/V2 loop region of gp120. their side chains are buried within the protein or located in small cavities. mutated residues H66Q and W112R may form hydrogen bonds stabilizing helices within the inner domain of gp120. mutated residues found in clones 4.3.B01 and 4.3.D01 are shown in green. the molecule was rotated 90\u00b0 around the x-axis and residues found in 4.3.B01 and 4.3.D01 are shown in green. P. pastoris yeast strains with human or human-like N-linked glycosyation have been reported to overcome this limitation. we compared HIV-1 JR-FL gp120 produced in either YVH10 or glycan-engineered Pichia for binding to a panel of conformational HIV-1 bnAbs. the mannose-rich N-glycosylation in YVH10 is trimmed to a more human-like 5-mannose stem in engine gp120 trimmed at N- and C-termini, full-length gp120, full-length gp140, and gp41 lacking its hydrophobic fusion peptide. omission of the fusion peptide clearly enhanced secretion of gp41. gp120 collapsed near its expected MW of 52 kDa after treatment with N-glycosidase PNGase F. expression analysis of different gp140 fragments, including gp120 inner and outer domain (inner and outer), CD4 binding site (CD4bs), V1/2 loop region (V1/2), the V3 loop (V3) and helical regions 1 and 2 of gp41 (H1, H2). Lane is non-adjacent but originates from the same blot. gp120 core lacks many of the epitopes of d-SOSIP, including variable loop and gp41-associated epitopes. induced yeast cells always included a population that did not display the heterologous protein, which is a feature of the Aga2 display system. OSIP gp140 (d-SOSIP), JR-FL d-SOSIP gp140 D368R mutant (d-SOSIP D368R), YU2 gp120 core (gp120 core) or an Hepatitis C Virus reference protein (HCV E2) probed for display level. a library of 2.0x107 members was prepared, with each member containing an average of about 6.7 random amino acid mutations. d-SOSIP and the 3.3 pool variants were DNA-shuffled at a 1:1 ratio. the selected 4.3 population pools showed both greatly enhanced expression and binding to CD4bs mAbs VRC01 and b6. there was no difference in binding observed between tracks 1, 2 and 3. aa/gene 256 nM VRC01 - - No 1.2 FACS - - 256 nM VRC01 - - No 1.3 FACS - - 128 nM VRC01 - - No 2.2 FACS - - 128 nM VRC01 - - No 2.3 FACS - - 128 nM VRC01 - - No 2.4 FACS - - 128 d-SOSIP gp140 (d-SOSIP) and d-SOSIP D368R to HIV mAbs VRC01 or b6. expression-normalized median fluorescence intensity (nMFI) is plotted against antibody concentration. errors represent standard deviations of triplicate measurements. improved binding to natural ligand CD4-Fc was not detected. binding was maintained at a comparable level with d-SOSIP. clones 4.3.B01 (black) and 4.3.D01 (green) selected after DNA shuffling. 4.3.D01 cluster in a relatively narrow region within the V1/V2 loop region of gp120. mutated residues H66Q and W112R may form hydrogen bonds stabilizing helices within the inner domain of gp120. mutated residues H66Q and W112R may form hydrogen bonds stabilizing helices within the inner domain of gp120. a key attribute of most effective anti-viral vaccine responses is development of antibodies to viral envelope proteins which result in the ability to prevent or clear viral infection [61]. induction of neutralizing antibodies capable of blocking viral infection has been a cornerstone of HIV vaccine efforts. a growing number of envelope sequences with SOS and IP mutations have been individually constructed and tested. a complementary approach to the strictly rational development of stable, uniform and well-behaved proteins is combinatorial protein engineering. cellular protein display methods, yeast display in particular, have standing as the gold-standard for evolution of complex and glycosylated proteins. variant of JR-FL SOSIP gp140 represents the first use of a high-throughput platform for whole envelope evolution. variants with improved expression and binding to conformational HIV antibodies could be evolved from repeated rounds of random mutagenesis and flow-cytometric selection points toward promising utility. major classes of bnAbs, including glycan-specific Abs, bound to yeast-produced gp140 variants, were observed after selection. three of the nine mutations (H66Q, W112R and I424N) may form novel hydrogen bonds. these mutations may be related to poor folding of gp140 in S. cerevisiae. gp120 core lacking this domain binds well to d-SOSIP gp140 in S. cerevisiae. fusion peptide could be mutated back to wild-type if it affects trimer structure, or fusion peptide variants could be selected from yeast-displayed libraries that improve trimer-specific antibody recognition. d-SOSIP gp140 variants evolved and the platform and approach described here provide a step forward toward the development of promising novel HIV immunogens. pBGP1-JRFL-gp120, pBGP1-JRFL-gp41 and pBGP1-JRFL-gp41dFP were amplified from pPPI4-JRFL-SOSIPopt_R6 gp140[36] using primers JRFL-for2 and JRFLgp120-rev2, JRFLgp41-for2 and JRFL-rev3.
