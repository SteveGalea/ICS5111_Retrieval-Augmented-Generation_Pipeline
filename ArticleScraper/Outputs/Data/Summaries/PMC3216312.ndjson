{"summary": "transmission of zoonotic influenza A viruses to humans is commonly the cause of new pandemics, which typically result in high disease burden and increased symptomatic severity and mortality. a thorough understanding of viral and host contribution to pathogenesis is required. a thorough understanding of both viral and host contribution to pathogenesis is required. the 2009 H1N1 (pH1N1) pandemic was accompanied by improved surveillance, thereby facilitating better estimation of disease severity and methods to examine the immune mechanisms behind complicated disease. this surveillance allowed for the identification of several novel risk factors among various populations, but with a limited understanding of genetic variation that may contribute to those risk factors. maori individuals represent 13.6% of the new Zealand population, but accounted for 25% of ICU admissions in the ANZIC study [18]. this is an overrepresentation compared to the 4.4% rate of self-reported aboriginal ethnicity according to the 2001 census (Statistics Canada) underlying genetic polymorphisms may lead to impaired responses. the pre-existing antibody response directed largely at the surface glycoproteins is rendered ineffective. underlying genetic polymorphisms may lead to impaired responses. atic severity observed during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic led our group to study CCR5 genotype among patients requiring intensive care admission and respiratory support for severe H1N1 symptoms. this observed frequency is approximately 2.5 times higher than that reported for local North American Caucasian populations [26, 27] an index case of severe influenza in a pregnant woman with IgG2 subclass deficiency measured total IgG and IgG subclasses in all patients with pH1N1 infection requiring ICU care. a low level of IgG2 was correlated with severe pH1N1 infection after multivariate analysis. NLRP3 (NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain-containing 3) inflammasomes are multiprotein complexes containing NLRP3, ASC (or Pycard) and caspase 1. the prointerleukins are in turn cleaved to their respective active forms by caspase 1. the second signal in the context of influenza has been elegantly demonstrated by Ichinohe et al. HLA Alleles The CD8+ T-cell response is a strong predictor of vaccine-induced protection. it has the additional benefit of providing some cross-reaction with new influenza strains. a comprehensive investigation was undertaken by Bermejo-et al. study enrolled 19 critically ill patients with primary pH1N1 influenza pneumonia. they used gene expression analysis to identify host immune responses associated with severe disease defined by illness requiring mechanical ventilation. they identified impaired expression of a number of MHC class II and MHC class I genes, and also of a cluster of genes thought to be involved in dendritic cell maturation. among hospital admissions, pregnancy accounted for 30% of female cases aged 20\u201339 years old. ethnicity was another major risk factor of pH1N1 susceptibility identified in several populations in north America and australasia. mortality in aboriginal communities in north America (3%\u20139%) was significantly higher than among nonaboriginal communities. the partial protection afforded by the immune system is decreased in some of the previously described groups. genetic variation in immune-related genes leading to either gain-of-function or loss-of-function phenotypes could contribute to the variation observed in pH1N1 susceptibility and disease severity. the 32 allele was found to be associated with an increased risk of symptomatic and fatal west Nile Virus (WNV) infection [20\u201322], a severe adverse reaction to the live yellow fever virus vaccine and with severe tick-borne encephalitis symptoms [23, 24]. together, these data suggest that CCR5 may also play a critical role in the immune response to flavivirus infections. NLRP3 2107C/A (Q705 K) rs4612666 (intron 7) rs10754558 (3\u2032 UTR) association with dysregulation of inflammatory response (2107), alteration of NLRP3 mRNA stability and enhancer activity [33, 34] HLA Various alleles Influenza-specific CTL responses exhibit varying frequency and magnitude across various HLA alleles. previously shown to be associated with IgG2 deficiency, but found similar rates among cases and controls. they corroborated previously reported finding of cytokine dysregulation among severe cases of infection. the mechanism responsible for the low IgG2 is the more robust Th1 response and a suppressed Th2 response. the CCR532 allele was found in 5 out of 9 of the Caucasian individuals, giving a Caucasian allele frequency of 27.8%. this observed frequency is approximately 2.5 times higher than that reported for local North American Caucasian populations. a low level of IgG2 was correlated with severe pH1N1 infection. a case-control study enrolled 38 Asian patients with respiratory failure due to severe pandemic influenza. they did not find any cases of selective IgG2 deficiency, but did observe significantly lower levels of IgG2 among the severe cases. NLRP3 (NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain-containing 3) inflammasomes are multiprotein complexes containing NLRP3, ASC (or Pycard) and caspase 1. the prointerleukins are in turn cleaved to their respective active forms by caspase 1. the second signal in the context of influenza has been elegantly demonstrated by Ichinohe et al. [31]. HLA Alleles The CD8+ T-cell response is a strong predictor of vaccine-induced protection. it has the additional benefit of providing some cross-reaction with new influenza strains. mRNA stability has not been examined in context of pH1N1 susceptibility or mortality. 19 critically ill patients with primary pH1N1 influenza pneumonia used gene expression analysis to identify host immune responses associated with severe disease defined by illness requiring mechanical ventilation. they identified impaired expression of a number of MHC class II and MHC class I genes, and also of a cluster of genes thought to be involved in dendritic cell maturation. the group with severe illness also showed higher expression of genes involved in IL-6 and IL-10 pathways. golgi-localized H1N1 M2 is both necessary and sufficient to trigger inflammasome activation. mouse knockout studies have shown that intact inflammasomes are necessary for innate immune responses to influenza A, chemokine production, and late stage viral clearance. NLRP3-mediated signaling is also important in cellular recruitment and tissue repair during infection. the epitope NP44\u201352 responses were higher in HLA-B27-positive donors. they also showed that the HLA-A1-restricted epitope NP44\u201352 responses were higher in HLA-A1-, -A2-, -B8-, and -B35-positive donors than in other donors. avian influenza A/H5N1 viruses are endemic among poultry populations across Asia and Africa. a total of 562 confirmed H5N1 cases and 329 deaths across 15 countries worldwide. a thorough understanding of the immune response and the mechanisms of viral pathogenesis is crucial to improve treatment. a compilation of confirmed H5N1 cases worldwide found that 22% of cases occurred in clusters and only 6% of cases within the clusters were not genetically related to other cluster members. some studies have suggested that the observed clustering of infections among families could occur due to chance alone at the low rates of infection that are observed in H5N1. sporadic and rare nature of avian-to-human H5N1 transmission may partly explain the sporadic and rare nature of avian-to-human transmission. a population genetics study found a significant enrichment of glycan biosynthesis gene SNPs associated with viral selection. ARS [36, 37] MxA 88G/T (rs2071430) 123C/A (rs17000900) Increased basal (123 A) and IFN-stimulated (88 T) MxA expression and activity in vitro; altered susceptibility to SARS [38, 39] OAS1 rs2660 (3\u2032 UTR A/G) rs3741981 (Exon 3 A/G) rs1077467 ( TLRs recognize many elements of foreign pathogens, including LPS, flagellin, and dsRNA, and initiate signaling cascades that result in the production of type I interferons. genetic variation in TLRs and their associated signaling components modulates the response to TLR ligands and, consequently, the inflammatory immune response. viral evasion and attenuation of the IFN pathway contribute to H5N1 pathogenesis in humans. a strong target for analysis includes the myxovirus resistance (Mx) gene. polymorphisms in swine Mx genes have also been associated with influenza susceptibility. cytokine response is believed to be at least partially responsible for the observed pathogenesis and high fatality of H5N1 infection. the robust cytokine/chemokine response often seen in H5N1 infected patients is at least partially responsible for the observed pathogenesis. genetic variants affecting expression and function of chemokine receptors may also modulate influenza pathogenesis, as CCR5 knock-out mice exhibit increased influenza mortality. in vitro evidence further suggests upregulation of CCR5 on monocyte-derived macrophages that may enhance pathogenesis. a number of candidate genes have been identified from both human and mouse immunobiology studies. identifying genetic variants involved in increased susceptibility and disease outcome could provide important data regarding crucial host/virus interactions. osamide alpha-2,3-sialyltranferase 1 (ST3GAL1) gene that produces the SA-2,3Gal linkage affects H5N1 susceptibility is not known, but remains a possibility. a population genetics study designed to detect human SNPs under virus-driven selective pressure found a significant enrichment of glycan biosynthesis gene SNPs associated with viral selection. TLR3 908T/C Missense mutation identified in a patient with influenza-associated encephalopathy [45] Alternately, prevention of viral attachment in the respiratory tract is accomplished by host proteins that can sterically hinder viral HA binding. these proteins include serum mannose-binding lectin 2 (MBL2) and surfactant, pulmonary-associated protein A1 and D (SFTPA1 and SFTPD, resp.). polymorphisms in SFTPA1 and S a missense mutation (908T/C) in the TLR3 gene was identified and was shown to be a loss-of-function mutation. this suggests a protective role for TLR3 signaling in severe influenza infection. these results are consistent with studies suggesting a protective effect of TLR3 in severe influenza infection [45] 123C/A promoter SNP associated with SARS protection correlates with increased basal MxA expression, leading the authors to speculate that 123 genotype may be an important determinant of H5N1 susceptibility. studies have compared susceptibility to respiratory infections between wild-type and trisomy 21 patients. o include IFN, sIL-2R, IL-6, IP-10, TNF, and MCP-1 [75, 84\u201386]. Knocking out IL-1R in mice exacerbates H5N1 pathology and suggests that IL-1-mediated signalling may be important in protection. s to human erythrocytes is highly variable, with up to a 40-fold difference between individuals tested in one study. if variation in the human ST3 beta-galactosamide alpha-2,3-sialyltranferase 1 gene that produces the SA-2,3Gal linkage affects H5N1 susceptibility is not known. 532 increased mortality among CCR5 knockout mice. increased allele frequency among severe H1N1 infections. TLR3 is constitutively expressed on lung alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells. polymorphisms altering TLR function could contribute to susceptibility or protection from infection. this hypothesis is supported by a genetic study of a case of influenza-associated encephalopathy, a condition associated with apoptosis and hypercytokinemia. multiple SNPs in the human MxA gene have been associated with influenza susceptibility [79] and multiple SNPs in the human MxA gene have been associated with variability in IFN responsiveness in Hepatitis C infection [80] and SARS susceptibility [38\u201340] no studies have looked for an association between MxA SNPs and H5N1 disease outcome or susceptibility. ine response often seen in H5N1 infected patients is believed to be at least partially responsible for the observed pathogenesis and high fatality of H5N1 infection. cytokines both in vivo and in vitro include IFN, sIL-2R, IL-6, IP-10, TNF, and MCP-1 [75, 84\u201386]. IL-1-mediated signalling may be important in protection. the extreme cases of human H5N1 disease are very rare, sporadic, with scattered cases in different countries. the extreme cases of human H5N1 disease are very rare, sporadic, with scattered cases in different countries."}
