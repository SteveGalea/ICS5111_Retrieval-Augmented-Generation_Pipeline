{"summary": "a systematic review of published and unpublished economic evaluations of preparedness strategies and interventions against influenza pandemics was conducted. a systematic review of published and unpublished economic evaluations of preparedness strategies and interventions against influenza pandemics was conducted. since the 16th century, influenza pandemics have occurred at intervals ranging between 10\u201350 years. in march 2009, a new subtype of influenza A H1N1 virus was identified in Mexico and the united states. it spread to all continents in less than nine weeks becoming the first pandemic of the 21st century. systematic search was performed in specialist databases NHS EED (via CRD, 1992\u201322.09.2011), HEED (via Wiley Online Library, 1992\u201308.2011), CEA Registry (1976\u20132010), EURONHEED (via INSERM, 1980\u20132010), HTA (via CRD, 1988\u201322.09.2011), and research paper in Economics (rePEc) study selection All identified abstracts were reviewed by two independent reviewers from a review team (AM, KW, NP, RPV and SK) the papers were included in the analysis if they met the criteria shown in Table 1. Inclusion and exclusion criteria employed in the abstract selection process. the studies were assessed according to specific methodological and reporting practices for economic evaluation studies such as expression of perspective used, relationship between time horizon and discounting, reporting of incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs), performing uncertainty analysis, and declaration of funding support. a systematic search was performed in MEDLINE (via PubMed, 1950\u201322.09.2011), HEED (via Wiley Online Library, 1992\u201308.2011), EURONHEED (via INSERM, 1980\u20132010), HTA (via CRD, 1988\u201322.09.2011), Health Evidence Network (HEN) (via WHO/Europe, on 22.09.2011), EconLit (via Ovid, 1969\u201308.2011), and Research Papers in Economics (rePEc). search strategies used controlled vocabulary thesaurus terms, whenever available, and relevant free text terms, including \u2018pandemic\u2019, \u2018H1N1\u2019, \u2018influenza\u2019, \u2018cost benefit\u2019, \u2018cost(s)\u2019, \u2018cost effective\u2019 and \u2018economic(s)\u2019. the articles were grouped according to type of evaluation as follows: i) a cost minimization analysis if they compared costs of different interventions with evidence of equal effectiveness. ii) a cost benefit analysis (CBA) if they measured health outcomes in monetary units. data synthesis and analysis This review compared the value for money of different interventions for the prevention and control of influenza pandemics. cost effectiveness ratios were calculated using national gross domestic product deflator values and implied purchasing power parity conversion rates from the International Monetary Fund. 44 studies were considered in our analysis. the majority adopted CEA and CUA approaches. six studies reported CBA results and five partial economic evaluations. ex-ante = before the 2009 H1N1 pandemic; Ex-post = after the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. some authors used oseltamivir 75 mg once daily for 10 days for prophylaxis in young adults in the us. the number of vaccine doses ranged from one to three, with the vast majority not clearly specifying the duration of protection. a relatively high proportion of studies described the study perspective(s), selection of comparators, using discounting for costs and/or outcomes for studies with time horizon longer than one year, and performing uncertainty analyses. 16 studies (36.4%) did not clearly state the time horizon employed. Table 4 compares the quality of data used for baseline clinical data. more than half of this information was from non-analytic studies.

ICER = Incremental cost effectiveness ratio. Twenty eight studies adopted a societal viewpoint in the analysis. 18 studies were supported by domestic public funders, 4 by the for-profit private sector, 3 by public private co-funding and 1 by an intergovernmental organization. almost half of these studies employed resource use information from reliable administrative data sets from the setting of interest. over half of the utilities were derived from direct or indirect utility assessment rather than from unknown sources or expert opinion. the most appropriate clinical effect size source is the randomized controlled trial and a pandemic event is unrelated to the availability of this type of study. 4 4 (18) 2 (9) 2 (12) 2 (10) 0 (0) 4 (44) Rank 5 0 (0) 3 (14) 5 (29) 3 (14) 3 (14) 0 (0) Rank 6 7 (32) 4 (18) 3 (18) 3 (14) 2 (10) 0 (0) Rank 9 3 (14) 2 (10) 0 (0) Rank 6 7 (32) 4 (18) 3 (14) 2 (10) 0 (0) Rank 9 3 (14) 2 (9) 6 (35) 2 (10) 2 predefined ceiling thresholds, \u2018social distancing\u2019, antiviral prophylaxis for the general population plus the closure of schools, vaccination for the general population plus the closure of schools, and antiviral prophylaxis for household contacts plus the closure of schools are amongst the cost effective strategies for all low, middle and high income countries because their ICERs are well below the maximum threshold for low income countries. the effectiveness of these interventions is highly dependent on how the population interacts or behaves in the initial phase of the pandemic. only one study conducted after the 2009 H1N1 pandemic appears to employ real data in areas affected by the pandemic to construct a social network. despite a large number of studies of pharmaceutical interventions, existing evidence on their value for money is unconvincing. despite a large number of studies of pharmaceutical interventions, existing evidence on their value for money is unconvincing. in Figure 3, we present a novel approach to summarize cost effectiveness evidence across interventions and target populations. this is useful not only for decision makers in each country, but also for intergovernmental organizations which guide and support countries to allocate resources such as the WHO. this synthesis is dominated by only three studies, although data from 16 out of 44 studies were used. this is because the authors of these papers [29], [40], [46] assessed a wide range of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions and met the eligibility paucity of effectiveness and cost effectiveness studies on non-pharmaceutical interventions. limited number of studies assessing value for money across interventions. new acceptable guidelines for the economic evaluation of interventions should be developed to complement existing guidelines. the global community should be prepared for the next event by measuring the consequences of influenza pandemics. guidelines for the preparedness of influenza pandemics are strongly warranted.
