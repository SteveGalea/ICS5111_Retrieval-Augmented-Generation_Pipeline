{"summary": "the pathogenicity of drug-resistant mutants is a primary concern for the implementation of antiviral therapies. the pathogenicity of drug-resistant mutants is a primary concern for the implementation of antiviral therapies. acyclovir-resistant mutants of herpes simplex virus with viral thymidine kinase deficiency are attenuated in immunocompetent individuals. endemic human coronaviruses are recognized to cause primarily upper respiratory tract infection and occasionally lower respiratory tract disease in elderly, newborn, and immunocompromised individuals. peak viral titers occurred 10 days after the onset of fever, indicating a potential \u201cwindow\u201d period for antiviral therapy (16). Efforts are under way to identify specific antiviral inhibitors of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV that target viral entry or replication. we exploited the murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) as a model system to study the phenotype, genotype, and pathogenicity of viruses resistant to a broad-spectrum 3CLpro inhibitor, GRL-001. GRL-001 is a 5-chloropyridyl ester-derived compound which has been shown to inhibit 3CLpro enzymatic activity of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (24 -type (WT) MHV strain A59 (GenBank accession no. AY910861) was the parental strain used for inhibitor selection and mouse infection studies. in order to isolate inhibitor-resistant mutants, the MHV strain was serially passaged on DBT cells in the presence of increasing concentrations of GRL-001. 3CLpro mutations of mutant virus were verified by RT-PCR amplification and sequencing of nsp5. DBT cells at a density of approximately 1 104 cells per well were either mock infected with serum-free MEM or infected with an MOI of 1 in 100 l of serum-free MEM. the viral inoculum was removed after 1 h of incubation, and then 100 l of MEM, supplemented with 5% FCS and the GRL DBT cells were infected with an MOI of 0.1 at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. the medium was replaced with fresh MEM containing 2% FCS. the average titer of each time point was calculated from three plaque assays. the immunoprecipitated products were eluted with 2 Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) the gel was fixed in 25% methanol\u201310% acetic acid, enhanced with Amplify solution (Amersham Biosciences) for 60 min, dried, and exposed to Kodak X-ray film. 3CLpro was added to the wells containing assay buffer, yielding a final concentration of 100 nM. the reaction was initiated by the addition of 2 M UIVT3 substrate. the reaction was initiated by the addition of 2 M UIVT3 substrate. the inhibition of the 3CLpro enzymes by GRL-001 was monitored by following the change in RFUs over time. the initial slope of the progress curve was then converted to the amount of product produced per minute using the experimentally determined fluorescence extinction coefficient. the raw RFU values were corrected for background fluorescence. this value was then taken as a percentage of the uninhibited enzyme value. the amino acid sequences of crystalized 3CLpros were retrieved from the protein data bank (PDB) wild-type (WT) MHV strain A59 (GenBank accession no. AY910861) was the parental strain used for inhibitor selection and mouse infection studies. in order to isolate inhibitor-resistant mutants, the MHV strain was serially passaged on DBT cells in the presence of increasing concentrations of GRL-001. 3CLpro mutations of mutant virus were verified by RT-PCR. all infectious clones of mutant virus were plaque purified and propagated on DBT cells. plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 48 h and fixed by 4% formaldehyde solution for 1 h. the area of plaques was calculated by using Photoshop CS software (Adobe) immunoprecipitated products were eluted with 2 Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) gel was fixed in 25% methanol\u201310% acetic acid, enhanced with Amplify solution (Amersham Biosciences) for 60 min, dried, and exposed to Kodak X-ray film. the total concentration of the UIVT3 substrate was varied to give final concentrations of 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 M. after separate incubations of the assay buffer and UIVT3 substrate at the appropriate temperature for 20 min, 3CLpro was added to the wells containing assay buffer, yielding a final 3CLpro concentration of 100 nM. the inhibitor was added to 100 nM enzyme in assay buffer. the reaction was initiated by the addition of 2 M UIVT3 substrate. the fluorescence intensity of the reaction was then measured over 20 min. time course of the GRL-001 hydrolysis reaction was followed by monitoring the change in RFUs over time. the raw RFU values were corrected for background fluorescence. this value (M UIVT3 hydrolysis product produced per minute) was then taken as a percentage of the uninhibited enzyme value and plotted over time. in coronaviruses, 3CLpro inhibitor GRL-001 was used to select for inhibitor-resistant MHVs. the EC50 of MHV-A59 was 8.5 0.3 M (Fig. 1A) to obtain inhibitor-resistant viruses, wild-type (WT) MHV was serially passaged in the presence of GRL-001 at a concentration of 1 the EC50 for two passages. the MHV-P4 supernatant was plaque purified and the viral RNA isolated from individual plaques was subjected to reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) amplification of the 3CLpro region. single nucleotide changes at multiple genome sites led to single- or double-mutant genotypes within 3CLpro. sensitivity of mutant viruses to GRL-001 was analyzed using an antiviral-activity assay, and the EC50 was determined for each genotype. double-mutant viruses (T26I/D65G and T26I/A298D) induced significant cytopathic effects in the presence of high concentrations GRL-001 (50 M), indicating that double-mutant viruses have much greater resistance to GRL-001 (EC50 > 50 M) than single-mutant viruses BT cells were infected with virus at an MOI of 1, followed by addition of GRL-001. EC50s of WT and 3CLpro mutant viruses were calculated based on the results of the antiviral-activity assay. a plaque-purified isolate of resistant MHV harbors T26I and A298D mutations. this indicates that viruses containing 3CLpro GRL-001 resistance double mutations are impaired for replication in cell culture. infected cells with either WT or MHV-T26I/D65G pulse-labeled newly synthesized proteins with [35S]methionine for 30 min from 4.5 h postinfection. cells were harvested and lysates prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies directed against nsp5 and nsp8. nsp5 and nsp8 products were detected at 60 min into the chase. DBT cells were infected with resistant viruses and newly synthesized proteins were pulse-labeled with [35S]Met for 20 or 30 min at 4.5 h postinfection. labeling medium was removed and replaced with medium containing excess unlabeled methionine and cysteine. cells were harvested at 30-min intervals during the chase period. MHV-T26I/D65G inhibitor-resistant virus is highly attenuated. treatment with 3CLpro inhibitor GRL-001 selects for viruses that exhibit delayed processing and replication kinetics. four-week-old wild-type C57BL/6 mice were intracranially infected with 600 PFU of the WT (n = 5) or MHV-T26I/D65G mutant (n = 5) mice infected with MHV or MHV-T26I/D65G succumbed to infection by day 3. MHV-T26I/D65G-infected mice survived significantly longer than MHV-infected mice. the T26I/D65G mutant is less efficient at catalyzing hydrolysis of the UIVT3 substrate, which correlates with impaired trans-cleavage activity of 3CLpro. the decreased catalytic activity of the T26I/D65G mutant likely contributes to delayed polyprotein processing observed in the pulse-chase analysis. the inhibition of the 3CLpro by GRL-001 as a function of GRL-001 concentration was determined. the data were fit to a dose-response curve to obtain the IC50s. 3CLpro-T26I/D65G is about 6 to 8 times more resistant to GRL-001. the UIVT3 substrate was added at specific time points. initial rates were measured to assess the percent remaining activity of inhibited versus uninhibited enzyme (or free enzyme) at 25\u00b0C, 3CLpro-WT exhibited a rapid reduction of activity at early time points. WT and T26I/D65G MHV 3CLpro enzymes were incubated in a 1:2 enzyme/GRL-001 ratio at the appropriate temperature. enzymatic activity was monitored by measuring fluorescence intensity of the reaction after addition of the UIVT3 substrate at each time point. wild-type (WT) MHV was serially passaged in the presence of GRL-001 at a concentration of 1 the EC50 for two passages. further passaged in the presence of GRL-001 at a concentration of 2 the EC50 for two additional passages. the supernatant collected from serial passage 4 was designated inhibitor-resistant passage 4 (MHV-P4). sequence analysis of 31 plaque isolates revealed single nucleotide changes at multiple genome sites of 10285 (ACAAUA), 10402 (GAUGGU or GCU) and 11101 (GCUGAU), which led to single- or double-mutant genotypes within 3CLpro. the T26I/D65G double mutant was the most frequently identified genotype, with 61% (19/31) of the plaque-purified isolates showing these mutations. double-mutant viruses (T26I/D65G and T26I/A298D) induced significant cytopathic effects in the presence of high concentrations GRL-001 (50 M) double-mutant viruses have much greater resistance to GRL-001 (EC50 > 50 M) than single-mutant viruses (Fig. 2A and B) mutant viruses were calculated based on the results of the antiviral-activity assay. production of WT and mutant viruses produced in the presence of 3CLpro inhibitor GRL-001. DBT cells were incubated with viral inoculum for 1 h. the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing DMSO or GRL-001 inhibitor at 20 M or 50 M. the infectious virus titer in the supernatant was determined by plaque assay. representative plaques formed by WT and 3CLpro mutant MHVs at 48 h postinfection at 37\u00b0C. the relative areas of at least 12 single plaques were measured by Photoshop CS software. cells were harvested and lysates prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies directed against nsp5 and nsp8. in MHV-T26I/D65G-infected cells, the nsp5 and nsp8 products are detected 30 min into the chase. in the cells infected with the double-mutant virus, the nsp5 and nsp8 products were detected at 60 min into the chase protein labeling medium was removed and replaced with medium containing excess unlabeled methionine and cysteine. cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with antisera for nsp5 (B and D) and nsp8 (C and E), and the products were analysed by 10% SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. four-week-old wild-type mice were intracranially infected with 600 PFU of the WT (n = 5) or MHV-T26I/D65G mutant (n = 5) pathogenesis of MHV-T26I/D65G is delayed compared to that of WT MHV in highly susceptible type I IFN receptor knockout (IFNAR/) mice. MHV-T26I/D65G-infected mice survived significantly longer than WT MHV-infected mice (P = 0.0052) these results further document the attenuation of MHV-T26I/D65G. 3CLpro-T26I/D65G mutant forms of 3CLpro were expressed in Escherichia coli. enzymatic efficiency (kapp) (A) and inhibition by GRL-001 (IC50) (B) of both WT and T26I/D65G 3CLpro were determined at ambient temperature (25\u00b0C) and 37\u00b0C. kapp and IC50s were determined using the nonlinear regression program SigmaPlot. 3CLpro-T26I/D65G is about 6 to 8 times more resistant to GRL-001. this is in accordance with the insensitivity of MHV-T26I/D65G to this inhibitor. 3CLpro-T26I/D65G exhibited a rapid reduction of activity at early time points and enhanced activity toward UIVT3 substrate hydrolysis at late time points. at 37\u00b0C, 3CLpro-T26I/D65G exhibited some evidence of activity restoration, but it was again substantially slower than 3CLpro-WT. the inhibitor (GRL-001) is shown in bold type. intermediates and hydrolysis products are labeled with Roman numerals. the restoration of enzymatic activity correlates to the enzymatic rate of hydrolysis of GRL-001. resistance to protease inhibitors is low, as resistant mutants accumulate rapidly under selective pressure. the cost of resistance was high, with reduced levels of replication (42\u201344) resistance to GRL-001 comes at the cost of replication efficiency and pathogenesis. studies are in progress to develop analogs of GRL-001 that can be administered in animal studies. in vitro protease activity data indicate that the substitutions decrease enzymatic efficiency and reduce off-rate of the substrate. we speculate that the side chain of residues D65 or S65 may affect the local conformation surrounding -helix A of 3CLpro domain 1 (amino acids [aa] 1 to 100) the substitution of A298D may alter the conformation of at the -helix tail and impair catalysis. the double-mutant MHV (T26I/A298D) has an increased EC50 compared to that of the single-mutant MHV. this suggests that the mutation also affects inhibitor binding. additional broad-spectrum coronavirus inhibitors have been identified by screening existing drugs for their ability to block the replication of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and other CoVs (55\u201357). three compounds, imatinib mesylate, gemcitabine hydrochloride, and chlorpromazine hydrochloride, were identified in two independent studies (55, 57). Currently the targets for these compounds in coV-infected cells are unclear. studies were performed with virus selected in cell culture in presence of GRL-001. this indicates that resistance to GRL-001 comes at the cost of replication efficiency and pathogenesis. we speculate that the side chain of residues D65 or S65 may affect the local conformation surrounding -helix A of 3CLpro domain 1 (amino acids [aa] 1 to 100) and thus the conformation at the catalytic site. the role of A298D substitution in conferring resistance to GRL-001 is currently unclear. the substitution of A298D may alter the conformation of at the -helix tail and impair catalysis. the double-mutant MHV (T26I/A298D) has an increased EC50 compared to that of the T26I single-mutant MHV, suggesting that the mutation also affects inhibitor binding. three compounds, imatinib mesylate, gemcitabine hydrochloride, and chlorpromazine hydrochloride, were identified in two independent studies (55, 57) the targets for these compounds in coV-infected cells are unclear, and these drugs may impact host cell rather than viral targets."}
