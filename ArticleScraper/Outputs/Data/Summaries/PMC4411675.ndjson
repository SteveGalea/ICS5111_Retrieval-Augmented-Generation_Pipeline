{"summary": "human hCoVs cause 20% of common cold cases in mammalian and avian species. two highly pathogenic hCoVs, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SCoV) cause severe acute pneumonia and respiratory failure. the first two-thirds of the genome contains open reading frames (ORFs)1a and ORF1b, encoding replicase-transcriptase proteins. the remaining one-third encodes four structural proteins. some betacoronaviruses contain an additional membrane protein. the remaining one-third of the genome encodes four structural proteins. spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins (Orange) all proteins are depicted as monomers, but the S and HE proteins form homotrimers and homodimers. some betacoronaviruses have glycosylated HE proteins with a single TM domain in their envelope. one characteristic of CoVs is virion assembly at and budding into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) for most enveloped viruses, this process occurs at the plasma membrane. in this review, we summarize recent findings on the mechanism of incorporation of major M and S glycoproteins into CoV virions. the protein in COPII vesicles (Orange) buds from ER-exit sites to the ERGIC, which is a stable compartment in mammalian cells, and then to the cis-Golgi via a second undefined vesicular transport system (Grey) new live cell imaging suggests the ERGIC is a stable, stationary compartment in mammalian cells. transport from the ER to the ERGIC is mediated by COPII vesicles. in this model, the Golgi cisterna is not a long-lived, stationary entity. the ER and the Golgi complex are controlled by COPI vesicles. membrane proteins are transported directly to the plasma membrane or indirectly via recycling endosomes. no common signal for retention in the Golgi complex has been identified. coV-M protein consists of a short glycosylated N-terminal ectodomain. three TM domains were assigned to tm1, tm2, and tm3 regions. the TGEV-M protein exists in two topologies: the Nexo-Cendo orientation and less commonly the Nexo-Cexo-orientation. the minimum requirement for SCoV VLP assembly is controversial. assembly-incompetent MHV-M proteins lacking parts of the TM domain, the amphipathic domain or the C-terminal domain lack VLP formation ability. M proteins of most CoVs accumulate at the ERGIC and predominantly the Golgi complex. they are not detected at the plasma membrane of infected cells or single M-expressing cells. the IBV-M protein is localized to the cis-Golgi [72,76], while the MHV-M protein is localized to the trans-Golgi and the TGN [72,77]. MHV-M proteins require two domains of the tm1 region and 18 amino acids at the C-terminal for retention. each tm1 region of SCoV-M contains a Golgi retention signal identical to that of IBV-M. the tm3 region was found to contain a plasma membrane trafficking signal. wt MHV-M proteins form heterogeneous oligomers in the Golgi complex. MHV-M mutants lacking one or two TM domains show reduced or no oligomerization. oligomerization is not the sole determinant of retention, and it is unclear whether large oligomers of MHV-M proteins are comparable to those of Gm1 proteins. the minimum viral protein requirement for VLP formation differs between MHV and SCoV. independently expressed MHV-M proteins form large oligomers in the Golgi complex [87] but are not sufficient for VLP formation. a virus-free plasmid-based system was used to demonstrate the involvement of MHV- and IBV-N proteins in VLP formation. the role of N proteins is unknown; however, coV-N proteins predominantly form dimers in solution even in the absence of nucleic acids. the VLP or virion incorporation assay showed the importance of overall domains of MHV-M proteins for VLP formation to some extent. however, further truncation of the C-terminal end prevented formation of virions. the SCoV VLP incorporation assay involved the co-expression of mutant M and wt N proteins or M/N/E proteins. single or double amino acid mutations of overall domains indicate the importance of specific amino acids of the M protein for VLP formation, similar to MHV-M proteins. coV-M protein consists of a short glycosylated N-terminal ectodomain. three TM domains were assigned to tm1, tm2, and tm3 regions. a long C-terminal CT domain is divided into a closely associated, amphipathic domain following the tm3 region. the minimum requirement for SCoV VLP assembly is controversial. assembly-incompetent MHV-M proteins lacking parts of the TM domain, the amphipathic domain, or the C-terminal domain lack VLP formation ability. M proteins of most CoVs accumulate at the ERGIC and predominantly the Golgi complex. the IBV-M protein is localized to the cis-Golgi [72,76], while the MHV-M protein is localized to the trans-Golgi and the TGN [72,77]. tm1 region of SCoV-M contains a cis-Golgi retention signal. MHV-M proteins require two domains of the tm1 region and 18 amino acids at the C-terminal for retention. each domain alone, however, is not sufficient for the retention of mutant M or exogenous proteins in the Golgi complex. wt MHV-M proteins form large heterogeneous oligomers in the Golgi complex. MHV-M mutants lacking one or two TM domains show reduced or no oligomerization. both findings suggest the importance of oligomerization in the Golgi complex for retention. homotypic interactions for VLP or virion assembly have been reported in MHV [45,46,88] and SCoV-M proteins [89] since VLPs enable investigation of the mechanism of viral protein incorporation into virions, the VLP incorporation assay is frequently used. the minimum viral protein requirement for VLP formation differs between MHV and SCoV. the role of N proteins is unknown. however, coV-N proteins predominantly form dimers in solution even in absence of nucleic acids. the VLP or virion incorporation assay showed the importance of overall domains of MHV-M proteins for VLP formation. assembly incompetent MHV-M proteins with mutations in different domains could interact with other M proteins. these observations suggest the importance of M-M interactions via multiple contact sites of overall domains for VLP formation, similar to MHV-M proteins. the S protein (average 1300 amino acids, 180\u2013200 kDa) forms a trimeric spike on the virion surface. the protein is highly glycosylated, containing 21 to 35 potential N-glycosylation sites. the S1 domain contains a binding domain for a host cell receptor. the S2 domain is responsible for viral entry and cell fusion. orange and red boxes indicate potential ER retrieval signals (KxHxx- or KKxx-motif) and tyrosine-dependent localization signals/internalization signals (Yxx motif, where can be F, I, L, M or V) the CRM can be further divided into four subclusters. the betacoronavirus SCoV-S contains an ER retrieval signal. MHV, which has no such signal, is primarily transported to the cell surface. independently expressed IBV-S proteins accumulate in intracellular compartments. a similar discrepancy was observed for TGEV-S. a large portion of wt PEDV-S proteins was retained intracellularly. a chimeric protein with the TGEV-S dibasic signal was retained. the role of the ER retrieval signal of PEDV-S has been reported. both the wt SCoV-S and a mutant S protein lacking the KxHxx motif were detected on the cell surface to the same extent. however, when co-expressed with M proteins, wt SCoV-S could be retained at the ERGIC/Golgi complex via an interaction with M. however, when co-expressed with M proteins, wt SCoV-S could be retained at the ERGIC/Golgi complex via an interaction with M betacoronaviruses MHV and BCoV do not contain both an ER retrieval signal (KKxx or KxHxx motif) and a tyrosine-dependent localization/internalization signal (Yxx motif) a single tyrosine at position 211 of the amphipathic domain of MHV-M proteins is essential for M-S interactions. a single tyrosine of SCoV-M at position 195 plays a critical role in interactions with S proteins, albeit at different positions. tyrosine-based post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and nitrotyrosine are responsible for M-S interactions. the CT domain of MHV-S proteins can be divided into a charge-rich region and highly conserved CRM. the charge-rich region is important for S-incorporation into virions, while the palmitoylation of CRM is involved in fusion activity [105,106,107] ylation or cysteine residues within CRM of MHV-S proteins share two functions: M-S interactions and S-incorporation. neither palmitoylation nor cysteine residues of SCoV-S proteins are required for M-S interaction, but are essential for S-incorporation into VLPs. palmitoylation is essential for the S-incorporation of all CoV-S proteins. it is also possible that hydrophobic palmitic acids cause intra- or inter-molecular interactions that enable tight packing of the CT domain. these studies demonstrate the various requirements of palmitoylation for M-S interactions and S incorporation. recombinant IBV lacking an ER retrieval signal (KKxx) exhibited reduced growth but was viable. the tyrosine signal of IBV-S is essential for survival of recombinant IBV. the deduced MHV-S CT domain contains two subdomains: a cysteine-rich motif (CRM) and charge-rich domains, which partially overlap. some of the cysteine residues in the CRM appear to be modified with palmitic acid. two such signals have been identified in the CT domain of CoV-S proteins. ER retrieval signals (KKxx- or KxHxx-COOH) and tyrosine-dependent localization signals (YxxI or YxxF motif) are identical to the well known Yxx motif that functions as an internalization signal from the cell surface. the efficiency and presence of these signals differs among CoV genera or species. independently expressed IBV-S proteins accumulate in intracellular compartments. the dilysine signals of the full IBV-S protein and a chimera play an important role in protein accumulation near the budding sites. the tyrosine-based signal (YxxF motif) of a chimeric protein functioned as an internalization signal, but not a retention signal. wt SCoV-S and a mutant S protein lacking the KxHxx motif were detected on the cell surface to the same extent. however, when co-expressed with M proteins, wt SCoV-S could be retained at the ERGIC/Golgi complex. ER retrieval signal binds directly to COPI proteins, recruiting them into COPI vesicles for trafficking from the Golgi to the ER by retrograde transport. tyrosine-dependent localization signals (YxxF or YxxF motif) of CoV-S are identical to the well-known tyrosine-containing motif Yxx. betacoronaviruses use cell-cell fusion positively to disseminate their genes. infected cells are treated with tunicamycin, a spike-less and noninfectious virion is produced. the interaction of S and M proteins is essential for S-incorporation. a single tyrosine residue at a specific position in the CT domain of the MHV- and SCoV-S proteins plays a critical role in interactions with S proteins. tyrosine-based post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and nitrotyrosine are responsible for M-S interactions, although SCoV-M proteins have been reported to not be phosphorylated. the importance of palmitoylation for virion assembly was first indicated by an experiment using 2-bromopalmiate (2-BP), which inhibits protein palmitoylation. 2-BP treatment of MHV-infected cells caused under-palmitoylation of MHV-S proteins, which caused reduced S-incorporation into virions. palmitoylation (or cysteine residues) of MHV-S proteins share two functions, M-S interactions and S-incorporation, while SCoV- and TGEV-S proteins are required for S-incorporation. hydrophobic palmitic acids may interact with or insert into the inner leaflet of the lipid bilayer and fix the orientation of CT domains to expose a specific face, which is required for M-S interactions. recombinant IBV lacking an ER retrieval signal (KKxx) showed reduced growth but was viable. a murine-adapted PEDV lacking an ER retrieval signal (KxHxx motif) showed a growth ability and S-incorporation into virions. the ER retrieval signals (KxHxx motif) of SCoV-S appeared to have a marked effect on S-incorporation into VLPs. these findings suggest that the requirement of the ER retrieval signal for S-incorporation differs among CoV-S proteins. a plasma-membrane-targeting signal has been identified in the SCoV-M protein, although its biological role remains unclear. a recent electron microscopy study did not detect a well-ordered rigid lattice structure in individual virions, suggesting that the lattice-like matrix structure formed by M-M interactions might be flexible and unstable. the potency of the ER retrieval signal varies depending on the surrounding amino acid sequence. even the S protein with potent ER retrieval signal would likely not be retained intracellularly under this condition. these ambiguities make interpretation of their roles more complicated."}
