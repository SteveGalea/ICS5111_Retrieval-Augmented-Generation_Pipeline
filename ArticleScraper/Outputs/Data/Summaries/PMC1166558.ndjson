{"summary": "the SARS Extranet was a single, managed electronic and limited access system to manage local, provincial and other SARS control information. a web-based and paper-based survey was conducted with 53 SARS Steering Committee members in Hamilton. it assessed the use and perceptions of the Extranet that had been built to support the committee during the SARS outbreak. an extranet is a private network that uses the Internet to securely share information or operations with selected partners. it is accessible from any web browser; it is accessible from any web browser. the literature describes the use and potential benefits of local area Extranets in hospitals,[1] physician offices,[2,3] and small managed health care organizations. a decision was made to develop a single, limited-access web-based system to manage constantly changing local and provincial SARS control information. the site was developed to support the steering committee in disseminating to partners comprehensive information that was timely, current, accurate and relevant. the site was viewed as a private network using the Internet to securely share information with partners. set-up and maintenance of the site was estimated to require one programmer (100 hours @ $40/hr), one Information Architect and Business/Technical Liaison (95 hours @ $50/hr), and one communicable disease expert (10 hours @ $75/hr) over the twelve weeks the extranet was in use (total = $9,500) participants included all 53 PHCS members. the online survey form was dynamic and, depending on how a respondent replied to one question, determined the next series of questions. changes identified through the think-aloud technique related to branching of questions. the Hamilton SARS Extranet site was rated fifth among the web resources (mean = 3.4) the site had 3478 hits, and 30 respondents (88.2%) visited the Extranet. the home page received the average number of 37.4 hits per day. Extranet most favourably visited the site more often. those who rated it most favourably visited the site more often. the difference was only marginally significant. eight (22.8%) respondents shared the website address, username and password with middle management and staff. most respondents indicated they experienced no personal barriers to accessing the Extranet. some respondents indicated that time to access the site and duplication of information sent through email and the Extranet were barriers. potential future use of a local Extranet Thirty-four respondents rated the usefulness (1-lowest to 5-highest) of communication strategies used during the outbreak. email, teleconferences, and face-to-face meetings were rated the highest. the Hamilton SARS Extranet site was rated fifth among the web resources (mean = 3.4) most respondents visited the site at least once every few days. the home page received the average number of 37.4 hits per day. those who rated the site most favorably visited the site more often. most commonly, users visited to obtain SARS Steering Committee minutes (63.3%), access \"Hamilton medical advisories\" (53.3%) and obtain the SARS Steering Committee contact list (53.3%) 8 (22.8%) respondents shared the website address, username and password with middle management and staff. most respondents indicated that they experienced no personal barriers to accessing the Extranet. some respondents indicated that time to access the site and duplication of information sent through email and the Extranet were barriers. potential future use of a local Extranet Thirty respondents identified features they would like to see on a future Extranet so as to enhance communication with the public health department. participants preferred email, face-to-face meetings, or phone communication to any Internet communication strategy. the extranet could be used for communicable disease communication, surveillance and/or reporting. a discussion board or email link, web-conferencing and real-time online communication may provide more effective interactive web-based solutions. an administrator likely views the use of email as part of his or her daily routine activity, but does not view searching web sites as a routine. the Hamilton Extranet was rated low relative to other SARS web sites. the extranet was built quickly to meet immediate local needs during the SARS emergency without taking time to fully engage end-users in design. health units are therefore urged to work with their communities before the next emergency to create a secure password-protected Internet communication system. study showed that interactive communication strategies were preferred over static web sites during the SARS outbreak. a local area Extranet appears to have an important role in supporting local information sharing and communication in an emergency situation. pre-publication history The pre-publication history for this paper can be accessed here: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6947/5/17."}
