{"summary": "a short questionnaire to survey clinical laboratory practices relating to MERS-CoV diagnostic testing was sent by email to the directors and clinical pathologists in charge of the clinical laboratories performing MERS-CoV testing. a total of 27,009 MERS-CoV real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) tests were performed. most of the specimens were sputum (73.5%) 186 confirmed cases were diagnosed by real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) of MERS-CoV. specimens from tens of thousands of suspected cases were submitted for this testing. the outbreak of H1N1 influenza also had a great influence in the Republic of Korea. the survey was conducted by the MERS-CoV Laboratory Response Task Force of the Korean Society for Laboratory Medicine. it focused on the number of tests and the number of positive test results for MERS-CoV, turnaround time (TAT), request process, collection and transportation of specimens, testing and reporting, communication of results, laboratory safety, and reagents and equipment. daily test volumes peaked on June 24 (1,088 tests) and began to decrease thereafter. number of clinical laboratories that initiated MERS-CoV testing increased in the first two to three weeks. daily test volumes peaked on June 24 (1,088 tests) most of the specimens for MERS-CoV rRT-PCR were sputum (73.5%) 74.7% of all specimens tested and 82.9% of positive specimens were from the lower respiratory. all nasopharyngeal aspirates (N=293) were negative for MERS-CoV rRT-PCR. 35% of the laboratories (nine medical institutions and five referral medical laboratories) were not able to provide or analyze data on TAT. median TAT was 5.29 hr (first and third quartile, 4.11 and 7.48 hr) most of the MERS-CoV rRT-PCR tests were performed only by clinical laboratory technicians of molecular genetics divisions. most of the tests were performed by clinical pathologists via electronic processing. current status of clinical laboratories in referral medical laboratories was similar to that of medical institutions in many aspects. medical technologists of molecular genetics division 3 60.0 Medical technologists of molecular genetics division & other division 2 40.0 Results reported by: Doctors of laboratory medicine-Faculty 5 100.0 Form of report Electronic medical records 4 80.0 Phone call & report paper 1 20.0 Abbreviation: MERS-CoV. the PowerChek MERS Real-time PCR Kit (KogeneBiotech, Seoul, Korea) was the most commonly used kit. tech & Bioneer 1 2.9 KogeneBiotech & NANOBIOSYS 1 2.9 Equipment BIO-RAD CFX96 15 42.9 1 20.0 ABI7500 or 7500 Fast 11 31.4 4 80.0 Bioneer Exicycler 4 11.4 LG SLAN 1 2.9 NANOBIOSYS G2-4 1 2.9 BIO-RAD CFX96 & Bioneer Exicycler 1 2.9 BIO-RAD CFX96, ABI7500 or 7800 a total of 27,009 rRT-PCR tests were performed at 32 medical institutions and five referral medical laboratories. the proportion of medical institutions was significantly underestimated. one tertiary care hospital submitted responses for the survey but not the specimen list. 0 (0.0) 69 (0.6) 11 (15.94) 0 (0.0) 133 (0.9) 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) 138 (0.5) 15 (10.87) 1 (0.72) 135 (1.2) 15 (11.11) 1 (0.74) 3 (0.0) 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) 233 (2.0) 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) the median TAT was 5.29 hr (first and third quartile, 4.11 and 7.48 hr) for 26 medical institutions. the median TAT of more than a half of the laboratories was less than 6 hr. the results were reported within 24 hr in all medical institutions except one. the results were reported in less than 6-9 hr (during weekday daytime) or 9-15 hr (during weekday nights and weekends) the current status of clinical laboratories in referral medical laboratories was similar to that of medical institutions in many aspects.
