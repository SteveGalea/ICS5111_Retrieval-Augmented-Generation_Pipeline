{"summary": "binding of the ligand to the TLR extracellular domain causes homodimerization of TLRs via further interaction of the intracellular Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain. activates myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)-dependent and/or TIR domain-containing adaptor-inducing IFN- (TRIF)-dependent pathways. activated IRAKs directly interact with TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 6 (E3 ubi ORF1a/ORF1ab is the biggest one encoding polyprotein replicases 1a and 1ab. PLPro directly interacts with IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) to block IRF-3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. PLPro suppresses the NF-B signaling pathway by preventing IB degradation. PLPro interacts with the ubiquitinated forms of STING, RIG-I, TRAF3, TBK1 and IRF-3. de-ubiquitinating enzyme cylindromatosis inhibits NF-B signaling via de-ubiquitination and inactivation of TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and TRAF6. de-ubiquitinating protease A20 inhibits NF-B activation induced by toll- analysis of ubiquitin-modified proteins reveals change in ubiquitination of TRAF3 and TRFA6 played crucial role in antagonistic mechanisms of TLR7-mediated type I IFN induction and NF-B activation by PLPro. results 2.1. PLPro Suppressed TLR7 Agonist-Induced Production of Type I IFNs in human promonocytes. the interferon-stimulated response element reporter of the dual-luciferase assay was further performed. the TLR7 agonist dose-dependently upregulated the IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), including PKR and IRF7, in vector control cells, but not PLPro-expressing cells. ISRE-driven luciferase activity was normalized by Renilla luciferase activity (A) mRNA levels of PKR (B) and IRF7 (C) were normalized by GAPDH mRNA. activated status of STAT1 was examined using Western blot with anti-phospho-STAT1 antibodies (D) the levels of NF-B p65, p38 MAPK and c-Jun phosphorylation were detected in responses to TLR7 agonist. PLPro suppressed TLR7-induced cytokines through decreasing the phospho-NF-B p65, p38 MAPK and c-Jun. ly luciferase activity normalized by Renilla luciferase activity (A) mRNA levels of IL-6 (B) and IL-8 (C) were normalized by GAPDH mRNA. activated status of p38 MAPK and AP-1 was examined using Western blot with anti-phospho-p38 MAPK and anti-phospho-c-Jun antibodies (D). PLPro reduced Lys63-linked poly-ubiquitination of TRAF3 and TRAF6. this correlated with activation of TBK1, p38 MAPK, NF-B and IRF3 in the TLR7 signaling pathway. Western blotting probed with either anti-TRAF3 (A) or anti-TRAF6 (B) antibodies. quantitative real-time PCR signified TLR7 agonist treatment stimulating higher transcriptional levels of IFN- and IFN- in vector controls than in PLPro-expressing cells. PLPro inhibited IMQ-induced activation of IRF3 phosphorylation. both types of transfected cells were treated with or without imiquimod (IMQ) for 4 h. mRNA levels of IFN- and IFN- were normalized by GAPDH mRNA. lysates were also analyzed using Western blot with anti-phospho-IRF3 antibodies. the effect of SARS-CoV PLPro on the activation of NF-B and AP1 promoters was further characterized via dual-luciferase reporter assay and SYBR green real-time PCR. results indicated that SARS-CoV PLPro inhibits TLR7 agonist-induced activation of NF-B and AP1 promoters. levels of NF-B p65, p38 MAPK and c-Jun phospho se reporter activity and the TNF- mRNA level were determined using the dual luciferase reporter assay (A) and quantitative PCR (B), respectively. the lysates were also analyzed using Western blot with anti-phospho-NF-B p65 antibodies (C) PLPro reduced Lys48- and Lys63-linked poly-ubiquitination of TRAF3 and TRAF6 induced by IMQ (Figure 5A,B, Lane 2 vs. 4) Western blotting analysis indicated that IMQ-induced activation of TBK1 was suppressed in PLPro-expressing cells. TLR7 agonist-induced IFN- stimulated the transcriptional activity of STAT1 to upregulate the expression of ISGs, such as PKR and IRF7, in vector control cells. however, there was no significant response of STAT1-mediated signaling due to the inhibitory effect of PLPro on the production of TLR7 agonist-induced IFN-. type 5 resulted in the increase of ERK1 poly-ubiquitination in PLPro-expressing cells. the high ubiquitination level of TRAF3 and TRAF6 may be responsible for the activation of the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. previous reports suggested an antagonistic mechanism of SARS-CoV PLPro. both stably-transfected cell lines grew in RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% FBS and 800 g/mL of geneticin\u00ae Selective Antibiotic (G418 Sulfate) the expression level of PLPro and TLR7 in both stable cell lines was analyzed using Western Blotting with anti-PLPro mouse sera and anti-TLR7 mAb. pNF-B-Luc were used to examine the activity driven from each cis-acting transcriptional element. PLPro-expressing and vector control cells were transfected with the indicated cis-reporter plasmid. the activity of experimental firefly luciferase and control Renilla luciferase was measured. amplification and detection of specific products were performed in an ABI Prism 7900 sequence detection system (PE Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA) real-time PCR was performed as described in previous reports [23,24]. immunoprecipitated proteins were dissolved in 2 SDS-PAGE sample buffers without 2-mercaptoethanol, boiled for 10 min, separated by SDS-PAGE. blots were blocked with skim milk, reacted with specific monoclonal antibodies anti-TRAF3, anti-TRAF6, anti-Lys48- or anti-Lys63-linked ubiquitin. blots were probed with specific primary antibodies against IRF3, phosphor-IRF3, STAT1, phospho-STAT1(Tyr701), NF-B p65, phospho-NF-B p65, p38 MAPK, c-Jun, phospho-c-Jun, TBK1, phospho-TBK1, TRAF3, TRAF6 and anti-actin mAb. cDNA was synthesized from 1 g total RNA, using oligonucleotide d(T) primer and a superscript III reverse transcriptase kit. each real-time PCR reaction contained 5 L of a cDNA mixture. real-time PCR was performed in an ABI Prism 7900 sequence detection system (PE Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA) amplification and detection of specific products were performed as described in previous reports [23,24]. nal antibodies anti-TRAF3, anti-TRAF6, anti-Lys48- or anti-Lys63-linked ubiquitin followed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection. PLPro inhibits TLR7-mediated signaling, leading to reducing of the cytokine production during antiviral responses."}
