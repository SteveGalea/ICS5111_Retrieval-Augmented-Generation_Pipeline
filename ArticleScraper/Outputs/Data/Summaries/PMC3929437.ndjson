{"summary": "fully human mAbs have emerged as the fastest-growing group of therapeutic antibodies entering clinical trials. the first fully human phage display-derived mAbs have recently been approved by the FDA for the treatment of rheumatic and chronic inflammatory bowel diseases. a plethora of phage-derived antibody libraries have been constructed that differ in design, origin, diversity, and method of generation. however, depending on the gene sources employed, all antibody libraries can be grouped into nave, immune, and (semi-) synthetic libraries. the design of synthetic libraries involved computational approaches and gene synthesis. seven libraries deriving from donors with high serum titers against herpes simplex virus (HSV) were employed for panning against the viral glycoprotein B (gB) of HSV-1 that serves as an entry receptor for viral transmission. lyNDAL concept is based on the cloning of individual lymph node IgG donor repertoires. of 1460 sequenced clones from 20 donors, 67% contained full-length scFv inserts with similar proportion of kappa and lambda sublibraries. 80 percent of LYNDAL clones investigated by dot blot screening were expressed as soluble antibody-pIII fusion proteins. individual clones from 40 sublibraries were analyzed by (A) dot blot and (B) western blot. clones expressed detectable amounts of antibody-pIII fusion proteins. lyNDAL primer set was designed for PCR amplification of all known functional human antibody alleles and families. Phylogenetic analysis of LYNDAL sequences. 280 randomly chosen clones from all sublibraries identified all antibody V gene families (A) and most of the functional VH (88%), VL-kappa (63%) and VL-lambda (74%) germline sequences (B) we chose envelope glycoprotein B of HSV type 1 (gB-1) as the target for antibody selection because of the high prevalence of HSV-1 in the adult world population (50\u201385%). 14 LYNDAL donors (82%) were gB-reactive with OD signals at least five times greater than those of non-immunized controls. lyNDAL antibodies were detected using an anti-phage peroxidase conjugate. the variable genes of selected scFvs were derived from various germline sequences (18 out of 117) and antibody families (9 out of 22) with a predominant use of VH1 and VH3 gene families and lambda light chains. scFvs were solubly expressed in periplasm of TG1 E. coli cells. scFvs were solubly expressed in periplasm of TG1 E. coli cells. 5 of 34 scFvs showed an almost three times greater reactivity toward HSV-1 than to HSV-2 infected cells. scFvs for binding to cell surface glycoprotein B of HSV-1 and HSV-2 infected cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. ex 75 column in two peaks at retention times correlating to the size of a monomer (34 kDa, 84%) and a non-covalently associated dimeric (scFv)2 fragment (57 kDa, 16%) both antibody fractions were therefore separated by preparative size exclusion chromatography. scFvs to gB on the surface of HSV-1 infected cells were calculated from equilibrium-binding curves. affinity constants were calculated as KD = koff/kon. bivalent binding of the dimeric resulted in increased avidity to glycoprotein B. binding activities of monovalent scFv and bivalent (scFv)2 measured on either (A) HSV-1 or (B) HSV-2 infected Vero cells by flow cytometry. Error bars represent standard deviations of the mean values. lyNDAL repertoires Selection of specific binders from phage display libraries requires expression of correctly folded scFv fragments on the phage surface. of 1460 sequenced clones from 20 donors, 67% contained full-length scFv inserts with similar proportion of kappa and lambda sublibraries. expression of intact scFv-pIII fusion proteins was shown for 27 of 30 clones chosen at random from positive dot blot signals. in total 73% of the LYNDAL clones could be expressed as complete scFv-pIII fusion proteins. 138 VH/VL-lambda were identified with verified scFv insert. all known 22 human V gene families and most of the VH (45 out of 51), VL-kappa (22 out of 35), and VL-lambda (23 out of 31) functional sequences were identified. sequencing of 280 randomly chosen clones from all sublibraries against the VBASE database identified all antibody V gene families (A) and most of the functional VH (88%), VL-kappa (63%) and VL-lambda (74%) germline sequences (B) lyNDAL functional germline gene usage against the three independent human antibody databases VBASE, VBASE2 and IMGT (C) lyNDAL of seven donors with high anti-HSV titers were combined for panning against target gB-1. polyclonal phage ELISA (A) confirmed enrichment of target-specific scFv phage antibodies during selection rounds 1 to 3. the frequency for non-silent mutations was comparable for both variable genes (VH: 54%, VL: 58%) the exchange mutations predominantly accumulated within the CDRs with the highest mutation frequency for CDRH2 and CDRH1 followed by CDRL2 and CDRL1. flow cytometry used vero cells infected with HSV-1 or HSV-2. all scFvs bound specifically to membrane-associated gB of both members of the herpes virus family. no binding was found on uninfected Vero cells. clones confirmed the tight binding (r = 0.90) of selected scFvs. of eight scFvs with HSV-neutralizing activity, clone 28 exhibited the highest antiviral potency. scFv 28 showed a 2-fold weak binding (KD 15.5 nM for HSV-1 and 14.8 nM for HSV-2, respectively, Fig. 8). affinities of scFv 28 and (scFv)2 28 for binding to both HSV-1 and HSV-2 indicated that this antibody must recognize an epitope. dimeric (scFv)2 28 neutralized both HSV serotypes significantly better than the monomeric scFv. efficacy of the dimeric (scFv)2 28 for neutralizing HSV-2 was even more favorable than that of a humanized mAb currently being developed for clinical applications in acyclovir-resistant disease. LYNDAL concept is based on assumption that human immune libraries cloned from antigen-encountered antibody repertoires may have unique antigen-specific biological properties. lymph nodes appear to be a highly valuable source for immune library cloning54 because fundamental processes of the humoral immunity take place within their germinal centers. LYNDAL represents one of the largest lymph node-derived antibody libraries to date. we combined sublibraries from individuals with high target-specific IgG titers for panning. lyNDAL was chosen as the target for antibody selection because of the high infection prevalence in the population. lymph nodes were obtained from 20 donors undergoing surgery. individual lymph nodes were thawed to room temperature (RT) and homogenized using a TissueRuptor. forward primer design was based on all functional variable gene sequences. primers bound to constant genes (kappa, lambda, and CH1) or to J encoding segments were designed on the basis of sequence information of the Kabat63 and VBASE database. transformed bacteria were spread on 145 mm 2xYT agar plates containing 2% (w/v) glucose, and 100 g/ml ampicillin (2xYT-GA) individual donor libraries were stored as glycerol (15% final) stocks in aliquots at 80 \u00b0C. individual colonies were inoculated in 96-well plates in 2xYT-GA medium. induction plates containing 150 l 2xYT-A with 0.1% glucose were inoculated. pelleted bacteria (3000 xg, 10 min, 4 \u00b0C) were resuspended in periplasmic preparation buffer. peroxidase activity was detected by chemiluminescence using ECL substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 32106) and chemical film Curix HT1.000G Plus (Agfa HealthCare) antibody selection Selection of herpes simplex virus specific scFvs, using antigen-coated immunotubes. bound phage antibodies were neutralized (pH 7.4) with 1 M TRIS-HCl pH 9.5 and added to log-phase TG1. after infection at 37 \u00b0C, both cultures were combined before continuing as described. each clone was analyzed for binding to coated selection antigen (1 g/ml gB-1 in PBS) and control antigen (2% MPBS) each clone was analyzed by incubation of blocked wells (2% MPBS for 1 h at RT) readings for gB-1 ten times higher than the average signal for milk protein were considered antigen-specific binding. a superdex 75 10/300 GL column was calibrated using gel filtration low molecular weight standards (Amersham Biosciences, 17-0442-01) scFvs were further purified to homogeneity by preparative SEC on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare) a standard coupling protocol was employed for immobilizing gB(724tHis) via exposed primary amines on a CM5 sensor chip. surface activation of flow cells No.1 and No.2 for 7 min was performed. the humanized version of a highly potent HSV-neutralizing antibody was used as positive control. the study was approved by the ethics committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Heidelberg University. lymph nodes were obtained from 20 donors undergoing surgery. kappa, lambda, and lambda encoding gene repertoires were separately amplified from prepared cDNA in several independent PCRs. antibody genes were PCR-amplified during the first set of PCRs (1st PCRs, 30 cycles), followed by re-amplification of PCR products (2nd PCRs, 15 cycles) individual donor libraries were stored as glycerol (15% final) stocks in aliquots at 80 \u00b0C. two transformed samples per sublibrary were randomly chosen, incubated for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C before serial dilutions of cells were plated on 2xYT-GA agar plates. the next day, the respective library size was calculated by extrapolating the average bacterial number from dilutions. individual colonies were inoculated in 96-well plates in 2xYT-GA medium. induction plates containing 150 l 2xYT-A with 0.1% glucose were grown o/n at 37 \u00b0C. pelleted bacteria were resuspended in periplasmic preparation buffer. antibody selection Selection of herpes simplex virus specific scFvs was performed as described previously66 with the following modifications. antibody-pIII fusions were induced by resuspending the pelleted bacteria in induction medium (2 YT, 100 g/ml ampicillin, 25 g/ml kanamycin, 0.5% IPTG) phage ELISA polyclonal phage ELISA (ppELISA) was performed by adding 1011 t.u./well of rescued phages to the antigen-coated microtiter plates. bacteria were superinfected with 108 t.u./well of helper phages at 37 \u00b0C. scFv encoding genes were PCR-amplified and subcloned as SfiI/NotI fragments into expression vector pAB170 for soluble protein expression in the bacterial periplasm (o/n at 18 \u00b0C) scFvs were purified by IMAC with Ni-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare, 17-5318-01) elution profiles were recorded by monitoring the absorbance at 280 nm. scFvs were further purified to homogeneity by preparative SEC. scFvs were concentrated with centrifugal filter units, filter sterilized, and concentrations measured spectrophotometrically. a standard coupling protocol was employed for immobilizing gB(724tHis) via exposed primary amines on a CM5 sensor chip. surface activation of flow cells No.1 and No.2 for 7 min was performed with a 1:1 mixture of 0.1 M NHS (N-hydroxysuccinimide) and 0.4 M EDC (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride) humanized version of a highly potent HSV-neutralizing antibody was used as positive control."}
