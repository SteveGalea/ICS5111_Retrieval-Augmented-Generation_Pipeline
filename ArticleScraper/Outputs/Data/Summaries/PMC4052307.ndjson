{"summary": "marine sponges of the family Plakinidae are known to be rich sources of structurally unique and biologically active metabolites. bioactivity-guided fractionation of the crude cyclohexane extract from the sponge Plakortis halichondroides yielded a pure endoperoxide metabolite, named plakortide E. the active crude cyclohexane extract (CY) was fractionated using column chromatography and finally purified with HPLC to yield the active pure metabolite plakortide E. the purification process was based upon the bioactivity results, i.e., only fractions which showed activity against the enzymes were purified further. the IC50 values for cathepsin B were determined at three different substrate concentrations (50, 100, 200 M) the values (29, 26, 36 g/mL, 82, 73, 103 M) were almost similar. in the normal enzyme assays, the compound was preincubated with the 10 fold IC50 concentration of the compound. if reversible, the inhibitor will dissociate from the complex and enzyme activity is recovered. plakortide E was determined to be a non-competitive, reversible, inhibitor of cysteine proteases. experimental section The sponge Plakortis halichondroides was collected by SCUBA diving at depths of 30 m in the Bahamas in July 2008. the lyophilized material (640 g) was then macerated and sequentially extracted with cyclohexane (CY), methylene dichloride (DCM), and finally methanol (MeOH) after filtration, the crude extracts were concentrated under reduced pressure. methanol/water amended with 0.1% formic acid 70:30, flow 8 mL/min, and the retention time of the peak was observed at 40 min. the compound 1 was identified as plakortide E by means of MS and NMR spectral data. column chromatography was performed using silica gel (0.063\u20130.200 mm mesh, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) spots were detected using vanillin spray reagent, UV 254 nm and iodinevapours. Plakortide E, obtained from the marine sponge Plakortis halichondroides, was identified as a new protease inhibitor. the anti-protease activity of the compound may contribute to its anti-parasitic activity against Trypanosoma brucei."}
