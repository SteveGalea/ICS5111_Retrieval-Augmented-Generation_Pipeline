{"summary": "in the united states, the rate of hospitalization of patients with sepsis or septicemia increased by 70% from 221 (in 2001) to 377 (in 2008) per 100,000 population. the incidence of severe postoperative sepsis trebled from 0.3% to 0.9% (16) Sepsis is especially common in the elderly and is likely to increase substantially as the population ages (8, 100) an insult triggers the release of PAMPs (pathogen-associated molecular patterns) and/or DAMPs (danger-associated molecular patterns) sensors can be different types of cells, tissues/organs, or proteins/other molecules, which themselves may function as effectors to modulate the immune response through various different pro- or anti-inflammatory mediators or biomarkers. sepsis is still defined and diagnosed by nonspecific alterations in physiology, including changes in temperature and heart and respiration rates. the disconnect between the identification of new therapeutic targets and the shortcomings of the currently available diagnostic tools was elegantly criticized previously by pointing to the fact that it makes no sense to use twenty-first century technology. a recent systematic search identified nearly 180 distinct molecules that have been proposed as potential biological markers of sepsis (207) only 20% of these biomarkers have been assessed specifically in appropriate studies for use in the diagnosis of sepsis (207). we address how new insights into the pathogenesis of sepsis may help in the development of sepsis-specific biomarkers and how this may impact the identification and development of new therapeutic targets. in 1847, obstetricians treated parturients who took part in autopsies introduced antiseptic practices before patient exams. the washing of hands with a solution of lime reduced the mortality rate of puerperal fever from 18% to 3%. this likely represented the first clinical trial in infectious diseases ever performed. fewer than one-half of patients who have signs and symptoms of sepsis have positive blood culture (BC) results or other microbiological proof of an infectious focus. fewer than one-half of patients who have signs and symptoms of sepsis have positive blood culture (BC) results. psis during this era led to the discovery that the host response to infection was both necessary and sufficient to recapitulate septic shock in Gram-negative bacteremia. this also rekindled an interest in the definition of sepsis. in order to assess the efficacy of novel immunomodulatory sepsis therapies, it became necessary to stratify and enroll defined cohorts in placebo-controlled clinical trials. there is a continuum from infection, sepsis, and severe sepsis to septic shock. the definition of sepsis requires the presence of infection and at least two signs of systemic inflammation. sepsis is defined when sepsis results in dysfunction of at least one remote organ function. patients who survive early sepsis develop nosocomial infections with organisms not typically pathogenic in immunocompetent hosts. immunoparalysis in patients with sepsis was further characterized by an association between low levels of monocytic HLA-DR surface expression and immune cell dysfunctions. this immunosuppression caused by sepsis is manifested by the loss of a delayed-type hypersensitivity response to positive-control antigens, a failure to clear the cellular necrosis from major physical injury and trauma releases mitochondrial DNA into the circulation, where it is capable of eliciting inflammatory signals. cellular necrosis from major physical injury and trauma releases mitochondrial DNA into the circulation. cellular necrosis from major physical injury and trauma releases mitochondrial DNA into the circulation, where it is capable of eliciting inflammatory signals. in one-third of sepsis patients, the causative pathogens cannot be identified. a biomarker should provide timely information beyond that readily available from routine physiological data. a biomarker should reflect the biology of sepsis, as evidenced by the biochemical changes that are characterized as the host response to infection. sepsis biomarkers can be classified into seven groups according to their biochemical properties. the host inflammatory response to infection may involve most if not all of these elements. it is unlikely that it will be possible to identify one single biomarker that is able to satisfy all the existing needs and expectations in sepsis research. a biomarker that can rapidly detect elevated levels of a specific target of an adjunctive treatment or reduced levels of a critical factor for replacement therapy is a prerequisite for drug development and the evaluation of novel and specific sepsis therapies. the inflammatory response will involve a more or less pronounced proinflammatory phase, dominated by the activation of innate immune weapons such as leukocytes, monocytes, macrophages, complement and coagulation systems, endothelial and epitheli sepsis patients will likely fall into category 2A (Fig. 2) and may display more or less pronounced pro- and anti-inflammatory responses. others may already start with a severe suppression of the immune response (e.g., transplant patients on immunosuppressive therapy) trials which assessed the efficacy of immune-enhancing strategies used the same nonspecific SIRS criteria for patient enrollment as those used by the numerous trials that addressed downregulating immunomodulatory strategies. in one single-center study, targeted immune-enhancing therapy guided by IFN- and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) resulted in improved patient outcomes. the impact on mortality was statistically significant in an adjusted analysis of IL-6-positive patients, but the incremental benefit over IL-6-negative patients was minimal. an analysis of the treatment effect over a range of IL-6 values revealed a greater separation of the mortality curves of placebo- and anti-TNF-treated patients at higher levels of IL-6 monoclonal antibody (170). a bioassay based on the priming of neutrophil respiratory burst activity by complexes of endotoxin and antiendotoxin antibody has become available for clinical use. a bioassay based on the priming of neutrophil respiratory burst activity by complexes of endotoxin and antiendotoxin antibody has become available. biomarkers are measurable by assays which have been approved for clinical use. this does not mean that the biomarkers themselves have been adequately proven to be clinically useful. C-reactive protein is an acute-phase protein released by the liver after the onset of inflammation or tissue damage. PCT 63\u201397 (infection likelihood), 38\u201390 (septicemia) 68\u201318 (infection likelihood), 91\u201347 (septicemia) 0.1\u20133.0 ng/ml 0.72 (infection likelihood), 0.79 (septicemia) PCT, IL-6, and CRP highly correlate with several infection parameters. a documented infection, determined by 2 experts taking into account complete medical data PCT 0.70 CRP 0.66 Cohort study of 200 ICU patients to detect sepsis at admission and sepsis during ICU stay (308) BPW 92 (sepsis at admission), 76 (sepsis during ICU stay), 81 (sepsis during ICU stay) 0.075%T/s 0.83 BPW may be useful as a simple diagnostic marker of sep sTREM-1 0.40 0.82 3.5 g/liter 0.61 MIF 0.47 0.80 0.81 g/liter 0.72 Neutrophil count 0.74 0.64 8.5 109 cells/liter 0.74 CRP 0.60 0.86 59 mg/liter 0.81 Composite 6-marker test 0.78 0.88 0.88 Prospective study including inceptive and validation cohorts of unselected ICU patients. the CD64 index is a useful and inexpensive test for improving the diagnosis and management of hospital patients with bacterial infection. the score is computed from plasma concentrations of proapolipoprotein CII (Apo) and a desarginine variant of serum amyloid A. PCT 83 85 0.5\u20136.1 ng/ml Graph provided Diagnostic accuracy of PCT markers was higher than that of CRP markers Microbiologically proven infection CRP 60 78 6\u2013100 mg/liter MA of 17 studies with 2,008 patients in the emergency department on the accuracy of PCT to diagnose bacteremia. no significant heterogeneity in studies using a cutoff of >0.5 ng/ml 0.87 (severe acute pancreatitis), 0.91 (infected pancreatic necrosis) PCT may be valuable in predicting severity of acute pancreatitis and the risk of developing infected pancreatic necrosis. a study that evaluated the predictive value of CRP for hospital mortality in 60 surgical patients at the onset of sepsis revealed no significant difference between survivors and nonsurvivors (279). in postoperative esophagectomy patients admitted to the ICU, CRP levels peaked on the third postoperative day and gradually decreased thereafter in unproblematic cases. in patients with community-acquired sepsis, the course of CRP levels was associated with the resolution of pneumonia (212). the complex binds the LPS of Gram-negative bacteria to form an LPS-LBP complex (273, 305) the complex binds to CD14 and toll-like receptors to initiate signal transduction. this leads to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor B pathways. PCT is produced ubiquitously in response to endotoxin or to mediators released in response to bacterial infections (that is, IL-1, TNF-, and IL-6) and strongly correlates with the extent and severity of bacterial infections (96). PCT has become the most widely used biomarker in the management of infection and sepsis in Europe. IL-6, or CRP only moderately discriminated infected from noninfected patients (276) in recent systematic review, we identified 30 articles on the topic and concluded that PCT may have some value as a diagnostic and prognostic tool in patients with febrile neutropenia. findings are not possible due to differences in patient populations and the quality of the studies. all published studies on antibiotic stewardship used similar clinical algorithms. for moderate-risk patients in the emergency department, algorithms recommended the discontinuation of antibiotic therapy based on four different cutoff ranges. most studies were performed with patients with proven or suspected respiratory tract infections. a meta-analysis focused on adult and neonatal ICU patients. the implementation of procalcitonin-guided algorithms decreased the duration of antibiotic therapy for the first episode of infection by approximately 2 days and the total duration of antibiotic treatment by 4 days. a study would require about 4,220 patients; a study to exclude an excess mortality of 2% would need to be powered by 16,500 patients (270) the authors pointed to the fact that random allocation at ICU admission had resulted in slight imbalances in terms of higher disease severity scores for the PCT group. some autoimmune diseases (Kawasaki disease) and paraneoplastic syndromes can also be associated with elevated PCT levels. only sparse and conflicting results regarding the value of PCT in systemic fungal infections have been provided up to now. traxins include serum amyloid P component (SAP) and C-reactive protein (CRP) the pentraxin is secreted by various cells, including leukocytes and endothelial cells. it binds to specific patterns of fungi, bacteria, and viruses and induces phagocytosis by its binding to complement component C1q (33) ine Biomarkers Cytokines are immune-modulating agents that may be derived from virtually all nucleated cells. endothelial/epithelial cells and resident macrophages are potent producers of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (38, 235) in septic patients, the secretion of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines occurs in a simultaneous manner from the very first moments of infection (266). in neonates, increased plasma levels of both IL-6 and IL-8 could predict an early onset of sepsis with high sensitivity and specificity (22, 192) plasma interleukin-8 levels obtained within 24 h of admission had a 95% negative predictive value for mortality in older adults with septic shock. IL-8 plasma levels were unable to discriminate between infected and noninfected pancreatic necrosis (220) high-mobility-group box 1 (HMGB1) is a 30-kDa nuclear and cytosolic protein known because of its properties as a transcription and growth factor. it is also a cytokine mediator of local inflammation as well as lethal systemic inflammation (e.g., endotoxemia and sepsis) it reacts more slowly than tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1. the pathogenic mechanisms that are involved in the interplay between coagulation and inflammation are very complex. changes in coagulation factors such as thrombocyte counts, antithrombin, protein C and S, activated partial thromboplastin time, D-dimers, fibrin, plasminogen activator inhibitor, and thrombomodulin are appropriate markers. there is no added value from the use of antithrombin or protein C measurements for predictions of outcome. the major limitation of coagulation parameters as sepsis biomarkers results from the fact that disseminated intravascular coagulation may also be triggered by a number of other disease states. however, coagulation parameters may be used as part of the inclusion criteria for sepsis trials that aim to evaluate the efficacy of anticoagulants. sTREM-1 levels could differentiate sepsis from SIRS and reflected sepsis severity noninferior to TNF-, PCT, IL-6 and CRP. sTREM-1 levels were also an effective prognostic indicator in critically ill patients. PAR levels and high mortality rates have been observed for patients with HIV, tuberculosis, malaria, and crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever. the diagnostic value of suPAR is low for sepsis; it may have some value for outcome predictions and for monitoring the response to treatment. the CD64 index has been found to be useful for the early detection of sepsis in critically ill neonates (118), was suggested to be an adjunctive marker in combination with more sensitive markers in medical ICU patients (98) levels of other leukocyte cell surface markers, such as CD10, CD11b, and CD11c, were found to be decreased. a combination of a multiplex immunoassay measuring suPAR, sTREM-1, and MIF was evaluated in patients with SIRS to detect community-acquired bacterial infections. the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of the six-marker test was significantly greater than that of any single marker (129). the clinical utility and cost-effectiveness regarding the management of septic patients need further prospective testing (250) 80% of positive blood culture samples included a pathogen covered by the molecular assay. the assay had a sensitivity of 94.7% and a specificity of 98.8%. the sensitivity and specificity were both 100% for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia. despite limitations, PCR may reflect promising approach to decrease time to results in a way that may favorably influence decision making for antibiotic therapy in the septic host. a significant share of blood culture findings was typically not reproduced by PCR. a total of 7,814 samples/episodes were evaluated for positivity rates. 7,347 samples/episodes were evaluated for the concordance of BC and PCR results. 6,586 samples/episodes were evaluated for the concordance of isolates. prospective 70 119 158, 2009 Adults, surgical intensive care unit, screening 2/wk Single center, prospective 52 258 157, 2011 Adults, surgical intensive care unit, SIRS single center 104 148 161, 2008 Adults, emergency department, intensive care unit, general ward, suspected bloodstream infection. single center 79 79 195, 2011 Adults, emergency department, intensive care unit, general ward, presumed sepsis Single center 54 78 202, 2009 Neonates a study by Louie et al. assessed PCR in addition to blood culture and other microbiological specimens. PCR detected potentially significant bacteria and fungi in 45 cases, compared to 37 cases detected by BC. the presence of a pathogen-associated DNA amplicon reflects a meaningful event in severe sepsis. PCR warrants further investigation regarding its suitability to guide anti-infective therapy. this could be achieved by technically less-demanding tests with higher accuracy. a cloned truncated protein derived from CXXC finger protein 1 can be used for affinity chromatography to achieve a relative enrichment of bacterial DNA out of blood samples. the time to result was reduced, as in other PCR-based approaches, to less than 8 h (234) despite the additional preanalytic step. transcriptomic profiling by multiplexed quantitative PCR (qPCR) and metabolite detection by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) may have potential in clinical development of diagnostic tests capable of overcoming limitations of single molecules to differentiate between infectious and noninfectious causes of systemic inflammation. proteomic profiling technologies, such as proteinChip surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization (SELDI), have been used to identify host genome-wide transcriptomic profiling studies involved trauma and burn patients. genome-wide analysis across the spectrum of pediatric SIRS, sepsis, and septic shock showed some common patterns of gene expression and repression across the entire spectrum. the authors of a systematic review did not find strong genomic evidence to support the classical two-phase model of sepsis (268) the most consistent finding in those studies was an upregulation of pathogen recognition and signal transduction pathway genes during the early and late phases of sepsis. 145 human white blood cell genes associated with acute infection and inflammation were identified as being abnormally expressed. sensitivity of 0.81 and specificity of 0.79) (269) could differentiate between postsurgical SIRS and bacteremia with an accuracy of between 86 and 92% for the detection of sepsis. IL-6 is the prototypical stimulus for the induction of CRP, but other cytokines also play a role in its production (87). studies with cancer patients support C-reactive protein as a marker of infection or of sepsis. correlation of PCT, IL-6 and IL-8 with sepsis in 78 critically ill patients with SIRS and suspected infection (102) PCT 78 97 1.1 ng/ml 0.92 Addition of PCT to the standard workup of critically ill patients with suspected sepsis could increase diagnostic certainty Determined retrospectively from patient files by specialists blinded to biomarker data. cohort study of 161 patients with at least 2 SIRS criteria presenting to the medical emergency department and department of infectious diseases suspected of community-acquired infection (129) suPAR 0.67 0.35 2.7 g/liter 0.50 Measurements of suPAR, sTREM-1, and MIF had limited value as single markers, whereas PCT and CRP exhibited acceptable diagnostic characteristics. bioscore of 0 excluded the presence of sepsis (101 of 105 [96.2%] patients); 129 of the 134 patients (96.3%) with a bioscore of 2 or 3 (44.6% of the cohort) were septic; bioscore of 1 was not helpful (61 patients [20.3%]) the bioscore ranged between 0 (all three markers below their respective thresholds) and 3 (all three markers above their respective thresholds) the \u201cApoSAA score\u201d is a biomarker panel identified through a proteomic approach. psis, severe sepsis, or septic shock (280) PCT 48\u2013100 42\u2013100 0.6\u20135 ng/ml Graph provided Procalcitonin represents a good biological diagnostic marker and is superior to C-reactive protein Clinical and/or microbiological criteria defined by those authors CRP 18\u201385 35\u2013100 39\u2013180 mg/liter MA of 18 studies with 2,097 critically ill patients. studies of critically ill patients showed elevated plasma concentrations of CRP were correlated with an increased risk of organ failure and/or death. however, a prospective study of postoperative sepsis showed no significant difference between survivors and nonsurvivors. plasma levels of CRP increase with a delay of up to 24 h compared to cytokines or procalcitonin (184). plasma concentrations of C-reactive protein may increase during minor infections. plasma levels remain elevated for up to several days, even when infection is eliminated. the use of PCT as a biomarker for sepsis and infection was first described in 1993. the biological role of PCT is not yet fully elucidated. PCT is produced ubiquitously in response to endotoxin or to mediators released in response to bacterial infections (that is, IL-1, TNF-, and IL-6) PCT seems to have some potential to discriminate between infectious and noninfectious systemic inflammation (44, 102, 186), also in low-acuity patients (152) levels of PCT correlate with the severity of the bacterial infection and bacterial load. recent guidelines recommended the use of PCT as an adjunctive diagnostic marker to differentiate sepsis from systemic inflammatory response syndromes of a noninfectious origin. antimicrobial resistance has emerged as a major factor affecting patient outcomes and overall resources. concept study (193) found a 4-day reduction in the duration of antibiotic therapy in patients with severe sepsis but only in the per-protocol analysis. one larger multicenter study and two smaller monocentric studies of postsurgical patients also confirmed a reduction of antibiotic exposure by procalcitonin use in the ICU setting. of 1.0 ng/ml were not decreasing at least 10% from the previous day resulted in the escalation of antibiotic use and the prolongation of antimicrobial therapy by 2 days. a recent meta-analysis and systematic review of procalcitonin-guided therapy in respiratory tract infections included eight studies that randomized 3,431 patients. en Antibiotics Duration in ICU Patients (trial number NCT01379547), Diagnostic and Prognostic Value of Serial Procalcitonin (PCT) Measurements in Critically Ill Patients (trial number NCT01362920), Serum Procalcitonin Study in the Management of Ventilated Patients (trial number NCT00726167), and the Neonatal Procalcitonin Intervention Study (trial number NCT00854932) a retrospective comparison of episodes of bacteremia or candidemia showed that PCT levels were significantly lower or near normal in nonneutropenic patients with candidemia (53). the value of PCT for the diagnosis of fungal infection and sepsis is poor. the 2012 update of the SSC guidelines suggests the use of the fungal cell wall components 1,3--glucan and mannan antibodies as biomarkers for fungal sepsis. in febrile patients, PTX3 levels were significantly higher in nonsurvivors than in survivors. hematologic patients with febrile neutropenia after chemotherapy predicted septic shock and bacteremia at the onset of febrile neutropenia (284) studies of the potential of PTX3 for differentiation between noninfectious SIRS and severe sepsis and septic shock are currently missing. studies with cancer patients support C-reactive protein as a marker of infection or of sepsis (80, 211). studies with cancer patients support C-reactive protein as a marker of infection or of sepsis.

PCT is the prohormone of calcitonin, but the induction of the prohormone during sepsis and infection is regulated differently than for hormonal activities of the mature hormone. the biological role of PCT is not yet fully elucidated. it involves a modulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase and cytokine induction; furthermore, the protein interferes with the receptor binding of other peptide hormones that play a role in the modul 0.1 g/liter had a very high sensitivity to exclude bacteremia (188, 283). the course of PCT may have prognostic implications (102, 134, 187, 283). the course of PCT may have some potential to differentiate between viral and bacterial infections. antimicrobial resistance has emerged as a major factor affecting patient outcomes. the potential of PCT to assist in decisions about the initiation and/or duration of antibiotic therapy (antibiotic stewardship) was prospectively evaluated in 13 randomized controlled studies. a total of 4,467 patients were included in the 14 RCTs (i.e., 2,240 in the control group and 2,227 in the PCT group) the authors found no significant difference in mortality between procalcitonin-treated and control patients overall (odds ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.73 to 1.14) or in a primary care setting (odds ratio, 0.13; 95% confidence interval, 0 to 6.64), in the emergency department (o the use of PCT for the discontinuation of antibiotics in patients with severe sepsis and ICU patients awaits further evaluation. a study would require about 4,220 patients; a study to exclude an excess mortality of 2% would need to be powered by 16,500 patients. nonspecific elevations of PCT levels in the absence of a bacterial infection can occur in situations of massive stress, such as after severe trauma and surgery (258) the power of PCT to discriminate between sepsis and sterile inflammation is better for medical than for surgical patients. pentraxins are a superfamily of proteins involved in acute immunological responses. they act as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) like the classical short pentraxins, the \u201clong\u201d pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is secreted by various cells. in hematologic patients with febrile neutropenia after chemotherapy, high pentraxin 3 levels predicted septic shock and bacteremia at the onset of febrile neutropenia (284). studies of the potential of PTX3 for differentiation between noninfectious SIRS and severe sepsis and septic shock are currently missing. cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 are closely related to severity and outcome of sepsis in patients. levels of IL-8 and IL-6, but not C-reactive protein, were significantly different between patients with microbiologically documented infections and patients with unexplained fever (80) plasma levels of both IL-6 and IL-8 were unable to discriminate between infected and noninfected pancreatic necrosis (220) a combined cytokine score comprised IL-6, IL-8, and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was associated with a worse outcome for patients with severe sepsis. the predictive value of the combined interleukin score for mortality was highly superior to those of CRP and PCT (5). low IL-8 levels have a high negative predictive value for sepsis. if IL-6 can be used as a very early predictor of infection or of sepsis, the role of cytokines as sepsis biomarkers remains to be established. in neutropenic patients, levels of IL-8 and IL-6, but not C-reactive protein, were significantly different between patients with microbiologically documented infections and patients with unexplained fever (80). in neonates, increased plasma levels of both IL-6 and IL-8 could predict an early onset of sepsis with high sensitivity and specificity (22, 192). high-mobility-group box 1 (HMGB1) is a 30-kDa nuclear and cytosolic protein known because of its properties as a transcription and growth factor. it is also a cytokine mediator of local inflammation as well as lethal systemic inflammation (e.g., endotoxemia and sepsis) it reacts more slowly than tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1. coagulation biomarkers The host response that is induced by severe infections and sepsis is often accompanied by disseminated intravascular coagulation. changes in coagulation factors such as thrombocyte counts, antithrombin, protein C and S, activated partial thromboplastin time, D-dimers, fibrin, plasminogen activator inhibitor, and thrombomodulin are appropriate markers. the BPW was significantly higher in the sepsis group than in the nonseptic SIRS group. the major limitation of coagulation parameters as sepsis biomarkers results from the fact that disseminated intravascular coagulation may also be triggered by a number of other disease states. sTREM-1 levels could differentiate sepsis from SIRS and reflected sepsis severity noninferior to TNF-, PCT, IL-6 and CRP. sTREM-1 levels were also an effective prognostic indicator in critically ill patients. suPAR levels had little value as a single marker to detect community-acquired infection in patients with SIRS (129). a marked association between high suPAR levels and high mortality rates has been observed for patients with HIV, tuberculosis, malaria, and crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (83) the percentage of PMNs expressing CD64 was higher in SIRS patients than in non-SIRS patients (214). the CD64 index has been found to be useful for the early detection of sepsis in critically ill neonates (118), was suggested to be an adjunctive marker in combination with more sensitive markers in medical ICU patients (98) levels of a number of other leukocyte cell surface markers, such as CD10, CD11b, and CD64 were decreased. sensitivity of sTREM-1 for the diagnosis of bacterial infection was 0.82. the specificity was 0.86. but it was neither sufficiently sensitive nor specific for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections (122) suPAR levels had little value as a single marker to detect community-acquired infection in patients with SIRS (129). the diagnostic value of suPAR is low for sepsis; it may have some value for outcome predictions and for monitoring the response to treatment. the percentage of PMNs expressing CD64 was higher in SIRS patients than in non-SIRS patients (214) the upregulation of CD64 expression on the cell surface of PMN cells and monocytes is considered to be a very early step of the immune host response to bacterial infection. the CD64 index has been found to be useful for the early detection of sepsis in critically ill neonates. in critically ill patients, the combined measurement of PCT concentrations and the presence of a biphasic transmittance waveform (BPW), an atypical BPW due to decreased light transmission from the coagulation marker activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), increased the specificity of either marker alone for the detection of sepsis (308). the clinical utility and cost-effectiveness regarding the management of septic patients need further prospective testing. molecular assays can help in shortening time to results. shortcomings include incomplete coverage of pathogens, inability of test to be applied directly to a biological sample, and restricted information regarding antimicrobial susceptibility. a combined diagnostic approach has been documented to lead to higher rates of detection of an alleged pathogen than with each method alone. the culture-independent, nucleic acid amplification-based detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns carries the potential to improve the detection of infection with typical easy-to-culture sepsis-associated bacteria. itivity rates and concordance of multiplex PCR and blood culture (BC) results from 27 published studies. the left two box plots indicate positive results. the right two box plots indicate the concordance of negative or positive paired samples. a total of 7,814 samples/episodes were evaluated for positivity rates. 138, 2010 Adults, isolation ward, hematological patients undergoing chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with febrile neutropenia Single center. prospective 86 141 142, 2009 Adults, emergency department, intensive care unit, general ward, presumed sepsis Multicenter, retrospective 436 467 143, 2010 Adults, surgical intensive care unit, presumed severe sepsis 2 center, prospective 70 119 158, 2009 Adults, surgical a study by Louie et al. assessed PCR in addition to blood culture and other microbiological specimens from the alleged focus. PCR detected potentially significant bacteria and fungi in 45 cases, compared to 37 cases detected by BC. PCR is a complementary strategy to validate the significance of an amplicon in the absence of a concomitant blood culture result. in predefined cohorts of patients with a fungal amplicon, these were observed twice as frequently as cultures positive for fungi. the presence of a pathogen-associated DNA amplicon reflects a meaningful event in severe sepsis. an increase of the ratio of pathogen DNA to host DNA may improve the diagnostic performance of PCR to amplify pathogen DNA against the eukaryotic background. the discrimination of \u201cself\u201d as opposed to bacterial DNA is achieved by immunocompetent cells via species-specific cytidylate-phosphate-deoxyguanylate (CpG) motif recognition via TLR9. therapy to restrict the duration and narrow the spectrum of therapy is currently considered valuable and may minimize the development of resistant pathogens. the promise of systems biology and \u201cOmics\u201d technologies will contribute to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of sepsis. 104 consecutively suspected sepsis/NEC episodes by using an ApoSAA score computed from plasma ApoC2 and SAA concentrations. the stratification of infants into different risk categories by the ApoSAA score enabled the withholding of treatment of 45% of nonsepsis infants. the negative predictive value of this antibiotic policy was 100% (Table 1) (191). genome-wide analysis across the spectrum of pediatric SIRS, sepsis, and septic shock showed some common patterns of gene expression and repression across the entire spectrum. there also existed patterns of gene expression that were relatively specific to each of these three clinical syndromes, in particular for septic shock. in 158 intubated patients after blunt trauma, expression patterns of 48 genes appeared to discriminate children with and children without VAP (299) another research group identified a molecular signature of 138 genes expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells that could differentiate between sepsis and SIRS among 70 critically ill patients with 80% accuracy. a set of 85 leukocyte genes detected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in 158 intubated patients after blunt trauma. expression patterns of 48 genes appeared to discriminate children with and children without VAP. a molecular signature of 138 genes expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells could differentiate between postsurgical SIRS and bacteremia. based on transcriptomic, proteomic, or metabolic profiling will lead to new diagnostic tools which help to recognize infection and sepsis earlier and differentiate between infectious and noninfectious inflammation. such tools hold promise for the identification of new therapeutic targets and the identification of patient populations that may benefit from specific interventions that are targeted at these targets."}
