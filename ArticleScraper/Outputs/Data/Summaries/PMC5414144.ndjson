{"summary": "new generation sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA gene PCR amplicons (NGS 16S amplicon analysis) is a powerful culture-independent open reference method that has recently been used to increase understanding of BRD-associated bacteria in the upper respiratory tract of BRD cattle. but it has not yet been used to examine the microbiome of the bovine lower respiratory tract. two leptotrichiaceae sequence contigs were assembled from bacterial DNA-enriched shotgun sequences. this suggests that we have identified a novel bacterial species associated with BRD. TU abundance between post-mortem lymph node tissue samples from dairy calves which died from BRD (n = 6) and clinically healthy calves without lung lesions (n = 8).. comparison of OTU abundance between post-mortem lymph node samples from dairy calves."}
