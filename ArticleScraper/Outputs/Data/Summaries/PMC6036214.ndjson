{"summary": "intracellular detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)2 is mediated by membrane-bound Toll-like receptors (TLRs) or cytoplasmic retinoic acid\u2013inducible gene I (RIG-I)\u2013like receptors (RLRs) and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain\u2013containing (NOD)-like receptors. production of type I IFN is also vital for the recruitment and priming of cells involved in bind to the promoter region of the IFNB gene along with resident transcription factor high mobility group I(Y) (12). formation of this multiprotein complex recruits transcriptional activators general control of amino acid synthesis protein 5 (GCN5), p300, and/or cAMP-response element\u2013binding protein\u2013binding protein (CBP) to unmask the downstream TATA box and initiate transcription (13) -like inhibitory protein (cFLIPL) inhibits IFN- transcription by binding to IRF3 and preventing its association with CBP within the nucleus. many viruses themselves also target the TLR/RLR pathways as a method of immune evasion (24\u201326). siRNA reagents targeting C6orf106 resulted in a >90% decrease in C6orf106 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels compared with cells transfected with siNEG, a negative control siRNA. cells were transfected with a pCAGGs-C6orf106 overexpression vector (pCAGGs-C6orf106-FLAG) as a positive control for reduced cell viability compared with control cells. asterisks show significant differences as assessed by one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test. synthetic dsRNA analog poly(I:C) is an established stimulator of type I IFN activation (8) and was utilized to mimic viral RNA replication. g, HeLa cells were stimulated with 2000 enzyme units/ml IFN- for 6 h. ISG15 mRNA expression was determined by qRT-PCR. i and j, mock cells were stimulated with poly(I:C) for the times shown. infected cells were infected with Sendai virus (SeV), an RNA virus (genus Respirovirus, family Paramyxoviridae) that induces type I IFN cytokine transcription in HeLa cells (47) C6orf106 inhibited type I IFN-, IFN-, and TNF transcription induced by Sendai virus infection. C6orf106 differentially modulates the antiviral transcription factors IRF3 and NF-B IFN-/ and TNF transcription is primarily controlled by IRFs and NF-B, respectively, that are activated and translocated to the nucleus. luciferase vectors containing IRF- or NF-B\u2013binding sites were transfected with siNEG. ISRE- (c) or NF-B-firefly luciferase (luc) (b) and Renilla luciferase (d) were transfected for 20 h and then stimulated with poly(I:C) for 6 h. all cell lysates were assayed for luciferase activity, normalized to the transfection control Renilla luciferase. a, HeLa cells transfected with GFP or C6orf106-FLAG for 20 h were stimulated with poly(I:C) for 6 h and then lysed. cellular proteins were separated into cytosolic and nuclear fractions. asterisks indicate 1 S.D. of a typical experiment from duplicate experiments. nuclear staining of IRF3 and p65 was observed in cells overexpressing C6orf106. a significant increase in both IRF3 and p65 Fn/c values was observed upon poly(I:C) stimulation. we also observed a small but significant increase in IRF3 and p65 Fn/c values. expression levels of cyclin B1 and actin were also measured. cyclin B1 expression was reduced by CHX treatment and increased by MG132. c6orf106 does not alter cellular protein levels of IRF3 and NF-B. depleting C6orf106 led to a small but significant decrease in p65\u2013DNA binding upon poly(I:C) stimulation. we then assessed whether C6orf106 binds IRF3 to prevent its association with the promoter. asterisks indicate significant differences as determined by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test. asterisks indicate significant differences as determined by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test. a modest interaction of C6orf106 with IRF3. nuclear and cytosolic fractions were isolated from HeLa cells expressing C6orf106-FLAG (a) or knocked down with siRNAs targeting C6orf106 (b) and stimulated with poly(I:C) as shown. equal amounts of nuclear lysates were probed for members of the enhanceosome complex. c, cytosolic fractions were also probed for the nuclear transactivators CBP/p300. a and b, HeLa cells were transfected with siRNAs targeting C6orf106 (siC6orf106) or a nontargeting control (siNEG) and assayed by qRT-PCR (a) or Western blotting (b) for C6orf106 expression levels. values are normalized against cells treated with transfection reagent only (mock) a, HeLa cells were treated with transfected poly(I:C) for 6 h. c, relative mRNA levels in HeLa cells stimulated with poly(I:C) 24 h post-transfection with cDNAs. d, cell culture supernatants from c were assayed for IFN- using ELISA. C6orf106 overexpression significantly reduced IFN- and IFN- mRNA expression in response to poly(I:C). induction of IL-6 and TNF was not significantly affected. secretion of IFN- protein was decreased in cells overexpressing C6orf106. cells depleted of C6orf106, or those overexpressing C6orf106, were stimulated with intracellular poly(I:C) treatment. in control cells, IFN- mRNA was rapidly induced and plateaued at 6 h of poly(I:C) treatment. however, the overexpression of C6orf106 reduced IFN- mRNA levels at all time points assayed. depletion of C6orf106 caused a smaller (140%) but significant increase in NF-B activity. C6orf106 overexpression resulted in an 80% reduction of ISRE-luciferase activity. a small (20%) but significant reduction in NF-B activity. a cascade of signaling effectors results in IRF3 phosphorylation and dimerization. poly(I:C) stimulation increased levels of phosphorylated IRF3. nuclear accumulation of p65, phospho-IRF3 and total IRF3 was observed to equal extent in both groups. asterisks indicate significant differences as determined by one-way ANOVA. mock- and poly(I:C)-stimulated cells were fixed and probed for C6orf106 and IRF3 or p65. the ratio of nuclear to cytoplasmic staining (Fn/c) was calculated using confocal microscopy analysis. cells expressing C6orf106 were treated with cycloheximide (CHX; an inhibitor of mammalian protein translation), and IRF3 protein levels were assessed by Western blotting. cells were stimulated with poly(I:C) to determine whether upstream antiviral signaling was also required for potential IRF3 degradation. C6orf106 interacts with IRF3 and inhibits binding to its DNA consensus sequence. we isolated cell nuclei and probed the DNA binding capabilities of nuclear IRF3 to its consensus sequence. a significant decrease in IRF3\u2013DNA binding was observed in cells overexpressing C6orf106. nuclear proteins (10 g) were analyzed for IRF3\u2013DNA (a) or p65\u2013DNA (c) binding. HEK293T cells transfected with IRF3 alone or in combination with C6orf106 were stimulated with poly(I:C), lysed, and subjected to indirect immunoprecipitation with an anti-IRF3 antibody. p300 and p300 were detected in cells depleted of C6orf106. there were no discernible changes in nuclear p65 or IRF3 levels. p300 and p300 were detected at extremely low levels in the cytoplasmic fraction. we show that C6orf106 does not interfere with cytoplasmic effectors and the activation/nuclear translocation of IRF3 or NF-B. instead, it interacts with IRF3 and impairs its association with DNA promoter regions. we propose that C6orf106 is a new member of an emerging class of proteins that act to regulate antiviral cytokine transcription from within the nucleus. IRF3/7 inhibitors such as RAUL and FOXO1 possess E3 ligase activity that results in IRF3 ubiquitination and degradation via the proteasome (19, 20). selective targeting of phosphorylated IRF3 has also been shown for TRIM26 (21), a protein with E3 ligase activity. cFLIPL binds IRF3 and prevents interactions with CBP and the IFN- promoter. C6orf106 was reported in a genome-wide screen of host factors required for HeV infection (27) we suggest that C6orf106 facilitates HeV infection by its modulation of antiviral cytokine transcription and/or modulation of p300/CBP. many DNA viruses utilize p300/CBP to modulate host gene transcription and promote replication (40\u201342). degradation of p300 has also been associated with lung cancer cell proliferation and expression of metastasis genes (44, 45), supporting an additional role for C6orf106 in cancer progression. future work will be directed toward defining the roles of C6orf106 in virus infection and inflammation. cell signaling technology, IRF3 (11904S), phospho-IRF3 (Ser-396) (4947S), cyclin B1 (V152) (4135S), GAPDH (2118S); invitrogen, actin (MA5-11869). transfections and drug treatments HeLa cells were reverse transfected with 40 nm siRNA (GE Healthcare) using 1 l of Lipofectamine 2000.
