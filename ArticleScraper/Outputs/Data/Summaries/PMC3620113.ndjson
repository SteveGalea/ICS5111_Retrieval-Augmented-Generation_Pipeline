{"summary": "people routinely engage in activities that vary in relative frequency and duration as well as in geographic location and, more importantly, their spatial behavior can be affected by changes in social and economic contexts. understanding the statistical patterns that characterize human mobility within cities poses fascinating scientific questions and major methodological, technical and ethical challenges. mobile-phone data have been the most widely used technology to capture and describe human mobility within cities. most information derived from mobile phones is coarsely tagged at scales ranging from hundreds to thousands of meters (depending on antenna configuration and availability of GPS-enhanced positioning) and sparsely collected over time (mobile phone data provides information of the location where calls occurred) unmanaged planning, limited public infrastructure and informal employment characterize most urban environments in developing countries [31] potentially making them more socially and environmentally complex than their developed counterparts. we hypothesize that human mobility and spatial behavior within resource-poor urban environments are strongly modulated by geographic distance. the major industries in the area are small commercial enterprises, fishing, oil, lumber, tourism and, to a lesser extent, agriculture. participants were given a 24\u201348 hour period to decide whether to participate or not in the study. a strict protocol for storage (in a secure MySQL database) and management was followed. the analyzed trajectories from 582 participants included 2,299,718 raw GPS positions tagged with date, time, elevation, latitude and longitude. a data reduction algorithm that aggregates consecutive GPS readings located within a spatial (d) and temporal (t) window was used to identify the geographic position and total time a participant spent at a given place. anisotropy is detected when variance is higher than the randomness expectation (grey line) the probability distribution of the number of places an individual routinely visited was determined by joining the I-cluster data with our highly detailed and frequently updated Geographic information system. a wavelet function g(x) is a scalable windowing function. a wavelet function g(x) is a scalable windowing function. a wavelet function is a scalable windowing function. the visitation data was then used to generate 168 Nij bipartite graphs. the graph represents all participants (i) linked to the places (j) they visited. a natural derivation of Nij consists in the generation of affiliation networks that link nodes distanced two units from each other. the affiliation network NP(t) was estimated as before. basic topological indices were calculated for each time slice. a high value of R(t) indicates that a high proportion of individuals were found at their most visited location. for example, a value of R(t) of 0.28 at 100 PM on Wednesday means that 28% of people were visiting their XML at that time. a significant proportion of individuals spent a large proportion of their weekdays on a single location (equivalent to a work-site) to highly unstructured routines in which the duration of visits was more evenly distributed among all locations. the higher the value of, the more structured a routine (i.e., the more it was focused on a single location) despite the unprecedented quality of our dataset, we acknowledge that the information derived may underestimate the full repertoire of movements occurring at the spatial and temporal scales considered. despite our sample size, we did not have enough information to assess temporal variations in routine patterns during and after holidays. participants were given a 24\u201348 hour period to decide whether to participate or not in the study. for children, verbal assent of the minor and written consent of the parent or caretaker were required. for adults, a written consent was required. I-cluster algorithm aggregates consecutive GPS readings within a spatial (d) and temporal (t) window. it estimates the total time a participant spent within such spatio-temporal buffer. the algorithm uses a threshold time (tintv = 30 min) to separate between data gap types. the probability distribution of the number of places an individual routinely visited was determined by joining the I-cluster data with our highly detailed and frequently updated Geographic Information System (GIS) of the city of Iquitos. the temporal patterns of visitation to each identified place were assessed by determining, from the raw GPS locations, the day of the week and time of the day each visit occurred. a wavelet function g(x) is a scalable windowing function. the main metric derived from fitting the wavelet function to the data is the wavelet positional variance. peaks in this variance indicate directions from each individual\u2019s home. a natural derivation of Nij consists in the generation of affiliation networks that link nodes distanced two units from each other. we first quantified the visitation to a given place on an hourly basis during a typical week (Monday to Sunday) by calculating the total number of GPS points observed hourly at each place. we considered the person as having stayed at that place rather than being transiently associated with it. node degree of NL Number of other individuals an individual is connected to given his/her movement into multiple places. Component of NP A fragment of the network (sub-network) involving only individuals interconnected with each other. value indicates how many isolated sub-networks are present inside the full network. a high proportion of individuals were found at their most visited location. a value of R(t) of 0.28 means that 28% of people were visiting their XML at that time. the model relied on mobility estimates inferred from the GPS data-loggers. the higher the value of, the more structured a routine was. we modeled the effect of changes in on the transmission dynamics of a directly transmitted pathogen. the model assumed all infections were symptomatic, and that no behavior change occurred due to infection. despite the unprecedented quality of our dataset, we acknowledge that the information derived may underestimate the full repertoire of movements occurring at the spatial and temporal scales considered. despite our sample size, we did not have enough information to assess temporal variations in routine patterns during and after holidays. GPS units were programmed at 2.5 min collection frequency interval and set to turn off at night. most (77%) GPS tracking of school age children was performed during the period when schools were in session. most (77%) GPS tracking of school age children was performed during the period when schools were in session. raw GPS locations (2.3 million points) obtained from tracking the movements of 582 individuals. map inset shows out-of-city movements. a wavelet function g(x) is a scalable windowing function. the wavelet function g(x) is a scalable windowing function. a wavelet function g(x) is a wavelet function. the analysis was performed for all places, and for places located within 10 km, 5km and 1 km of an individual\u2019s home. inferring mobility networks GPS tracking was not simultaneous for all participants, which were mainly tracked within a 1-year period. we considered the 15-day tracking period sufficient to characterize participants\u2019 short-term spatial routine. as 15% of participants had missing information for periods between 500\u2013700 AM and 1100\u20131200 PM, we excluded those times for the calculation of Nij(t) we first identified the location each participant spent most of his/her time on an hourly basis. Xi,d,h represents the place that received the highest number of visits at a given hour of the day. we calculated a binary variable, XML, indicating whether a participant was at his/her most visited location at hourly intervals during the tracked hours of 700 AM to 1100 PM. a high value of R(t) indicates that a high proportion of individuals were found at their most visited location. time spent at each location, type of location visited) were stochastically derived by randomly sampling from each parameter\u2019s distribution. the model simulated contacts at 15-minute intervals for a total of 10,000 time points (equal to 105 days) introducing a single infected individual in a fully susceptible population. for each simulation we identified the contact structure emerging from the introduced infection. we defined the epidemic curve and the epidemic\u2019s effective reproductive number (Re) [41] most (86.2%) movements by children 7\u201315 years old occurred within 1 km of their home. such value decreased only to 84.2% for ages 16\u201325, 77.4% for ages 26\u201335, 75.8% for ages 36\u201345, and 80.9% for ages 46 and older. the duration of visits to each place was exponentially distributed, with most (78.2%) visits lasting less than 2 hours. the largest network component (out of 22 components) accounting for 96.2% of all individuals and 97.8% of all edges (Figure S5 in File S2). the NP network had two components and 20 isolates. the main component accounted for 96.2% of all individuals. the network\u2019s degree distribution was similar for males and females. only 38% of tracked individuals showed some degree of regularity in their routine. a significant deviation from the 60% regularity reported for the hours of 700 AM to 1100 PM for people living in an industrialized nation. unstructured mobility routines were highly structured ( = 4) individuals spent a significant proportion of their time on the same location (equivalent of home or work) their contact networks were highly dispersed in comparison with individuals with highly unstructured routines ( = 1). the percentage of infections decreased to 88.4% [87.2\u201390.5%] for a scenario with = 2, 87.9% [86.1\u201388.5%] for = 3 and 79.4% [76.2\u201380.5%] for individuals who visit and allocate their time into multiple locations have an unstructured routine ( = 1). individuals who spend a significant proportion of their time at one or very few locations have structured routines ( = 4) most (81.0%) movements occurred within 1 km of each individual\u2019s home. the probability of movement outside an individual\u2019s home P(d) followed an exponential decay. as age increased, the tail of mobility kernels increased. most routinely visited places were residential (57.6%), followed by commercial (16.8%), educational (8.5%) and recreational spaces (6.4%). children 7\u201315 years concentrating most of their trips on residential and educational spaces. most (78.2%) visits lasting less than 2 hours (Figure S4 in File S2) the NP network had two components and 20 isolates. the main component accounted for 96.2% of all individuals. the main component accounted for 96.2% of all individuals. the main component accounted for 96.2% of all individuals. NP(t) are characteristic of \u201csmall-world\u201d topologies in which very few contacts are needed to reach highly distanced individuals. a high value of R(t) indicates that individuals spent a significant proportion of their time at the most visited location over a typical week. dynamic contact network individual-based simulation model quantifying transmission and propagation of a directly transmitted pathogen within an Iquitos neighborhood. we used the parameter, representing the mean time spent visiting a given location. the percentage of infections decreased to 88.4% for a scenario with = 2, 87.9% [86.1\u201388.5%] for = 3 and 79.4% [76.2\u201380.5%] for = 4. heterogeneous contacts have on the spatial and temporal dimensions of infectious disease transmission. red bubbles indicate individuals whereas grey bubbles the locations that belong to their mobility routine. some locations may not be visited every day. a time-varying pattern of human mobility and co-location can be quantitatively described by three network metrics. the size of the largest component, the number of components and the average shortest path of NP(t) at every time slice are characteristic of \u201csmall-world\u201d topologies. a high value of R(t) indicates that individuals spent a significant proportion of their time at the most visited location. a high value of R(t) indicates that individuals spent a significant proportion of their time at the most visited location (equivalent to work or school) the percentage of infections decreased to 88.4% [87.2\u201390.5%] for a scenario with = 2, 87.9% [86.1\u201388.5%] for = 3 and 79.4% [76.2\u201380.5%] for = 4. the larger the size of a bubble the more time an individual spent on a location. accounted for different levels of structure on an individual\u2019s daily routine (from = 1 to = 4) topological metrics of the transmission networks (median, Q1-Q3) obtained after running 50 simulations of the individual based model of the transmission of a directly transmitted pathogen. long-term spatial and temporal scaling patterns of human movement have been mathematically described most frequently by power-law distributions. power laws may not the most important component of human trajectories within resource-poor environments. in developed urban societies, activities to which an individual commits significant time constrain the ordering of other routine activities. most of the working-age individuals in this study lacked a repetitive pattern of visitation to specific locations that is compatible with a journey-to-work structure. instead, they engaged in various activities during a regular day, visiting an average [range] of 6 [1]\u2013[21] places, and potentially interacting with other individuals visiting or residing in them. these temporally unstructured routines affected the daily and hourly connectivity and architecture of the inferred mobility networks. results from a series of detailed stochastic simulation models suggest that halting human contact networks by closing highly visited places could substantially lower pandemic influenza attack rates. high variability in observed mobility routines may make it difficult to enforce household isolation or to identify which premises will need to be closed. most (>90%) of the mortality exerted by a potential pandemic influenza epidemic would occur in developing countries [49]. file S3 Supplementary Videos represent the temporal sequence of the infection. each video represents the temporal sequence of the infection."}
