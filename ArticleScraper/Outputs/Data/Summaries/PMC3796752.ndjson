{"summary": "female Sprague\u2013Dawley rats (Rattus norvegicus) were kept on a 12:12-h light:dark cycle, with access to food and water ad libitum. serologic evaluation of 2 dirty-bedding sentinel rats caged on the same rack gave negative results for serum antibodies to common rat pathogens. rats were ordered so that they were older than 50 d at the onset of experiments. vaginal cytology was performed immediately prior to ischemia\u2013reperfusion experiments to get the most accurate reading of the cycle stage. two independent reviewers examined the smears by counting at least 100 cells per slide in a blinded fashion to determine the stage of the cycle stage. rats were given a 10-min equilibration period while ventilated. the thorax was opened via a left parasternal incision, the pericardium was removed from the heart, and the left anterior descending coronary artery was ligated. after 25 min of occlusion, the ligature was released, and reperfusion ensued for 2 h. arrhythmias were scored from the electrocardiographic signal as described previously6,11 and in accordance with the Lambeth Conventions41. score of 0, 0 to 49 premature ventricular beats; 1, 50 to 499 premature ventricular beats; 2, 500 or more premature ventricular beats or 1 episode of spontaneously reverting VT or VF less than 30 s. female Sprague\u2013Dawley rats (Rattus norvegicus) were kept on a 12:12-h light:dark cycle, with access to food and water ad libitum. serologic evaluation of 2 dirty-bedding sentinel rats caged on the same rack gave negative results for serum antibodies to common rat pathogens. rats were ordered so that they were older than 50 d at the onset of experiments. vaginal cytology was performed immediately prior to ischemia\u2013reperfusion experiments to get the most accurate reading of the cycle stage. two independent reviewers examined the smears by counting at least 100 cells per slide in a blinded fashion to determine the stage of the cycle stage. rats were given a 10-min equilibration period while ventilated. the thorax was opened via a left parasternal incision, the pericardium was removed from the heart, and the left anterior descending coronary artery was ligated. after 25 min of occlusion, the ligature was released, and reperfusion ensued for 2 h. arrhythmias were scored from the electrocardiographic signal as described previously6,11 and in accordance with the Lambeth Conventions41. score of 0, 0 to 49 premature ventricular beats; 1, 50 to 499 premature ventricular beats; 2, 500 or more premature ventricular beats or 1 episode of spontaneously reverting VT or VF less than 30 s in total duration; 3, one or more episodes of reverting VT or VF. no significant differences were observed in body weight or heart weight across stages of the estrous cycle in vivo. there were no differences in baseline left ventricular developed pressure, coronary flow, or heart rate in ex vivo hearts. in vivo, surgical preparation (proestrus, 31% 4%; estrus, 29% 4%; metestrus, 28% 2%; diestrus, 30% 4%; P = 0.91) there were no differences in the zone-at-risk between stages (proestrus, 48% 4%; estrus, 52% 3%; metestrus, 52% 3%; metestrus, 49% 5%; diestrus, 53% 4%; P = 0.91) rous, 230 8 bpm; estrus, 192 16 bpm; metestrus, 192 14 bpm; and diestrus, 220 16 bpm. no differences in infarct size were seen between stages for the in vivo, surgical preparation. there was no correlation between the level of circulating 17-estradiol at the time of heart excision and infarct size in the ex vivo preparation. there was no correlation between infarct size and serum levels of estradiol in isolated rat hearts. rat estrous cycle does not influence ischemia\u2013reperfusion injury in studies where estrous has not, or cannot be controlled for. the cardioprotective phenotype of premenopausal female animals has been demonstrated in mice, rats, rabbits and dogs. exogenous estradiol administration can affect ischemia\u2013reperfusion injury. it increases the activity of the PI3K/Akt pathway. inhibition of PI3K and PKC has been shown to diminish cardiac function and increase infarct size in female, but not male, rats. circulating hormone levels during various estrous- cycle stages do not influence cardiac ischemia\u2013reperfusion injury in rats. circulating hormone levels during various estrous- cycle stages do not influence cardiac ischemia\u2013reperfusion injury in rats. serum estradiol level of rats is not correlated with infarct size or arrhythmia."}
