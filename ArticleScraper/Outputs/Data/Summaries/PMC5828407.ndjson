Peptide spots of APN in the membrane. the membranes with 318 spots encompass the entire APN coding region (963 AAs) each peptide was 13 amino acids in length and offset from its neighboring peptide by 3 amino acids. the initial three-dimensional structure of APN was performed by modeller9.17 based on the template structure obtained from protein data bank (PDB 4FKE) three dimensional structures of the FaeG sequences present in the F4ab+APN (PDB 4WE2), F4ac+APN (PDB 2J6R) and F4ad+APN (PDB 4WEU) are shown as rose-red, purple, and blue."}
