{"summary": "coVs are a type species of enveloped viruses with a single-stranded positive RNA genome of approximately 26\u201332 kilobases. all coVs share similarities in the organization and expression of their genome. coVs are separated into four genera based on phylogeny: alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV. TBK1-IKK complex mediates downstream activation of critical transcription factors, interferon regulation factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor B (NF-B), triggering their nuclear translocation. a new molecule acts as a protein activator of protein kinase R (PKR), namely protein activator of the interferon-induced protein kinase (PKR), and also promotes RIG-I signaling in response to viral infection and dsRNA. MHV N protein exerts its IFN-antagonizing function by targeting PACT, thereby impairing PACT-RIG-I/MDA5 interactions and RIG-I/MDA5 activation for downstream IFN production. this is the same evasion strategy developed by SARS-CoV N protein. the expression of MHV N protein was detected by immunoblotting with an anti-Flag antibody. the expression of MHV N protein was significantly reduced in MHV N protein-expressing cells. meanwhile, SEV NH RNA in mock cells equals to cells expressing MHV N protein. HEK-293T cells were transfected with MHV-N expression plasmid. after infection with SEV for 12 h, cells were lysed to extract total RNA. the results are expressed as increases in mRNA levels or SEV HN gene copies relative to those in cells transfected without SEV infection. MHV N protein blocks IFN- production by targeting molecule(s) upstream of RIG-I and MDA5 RIG-I and MDA5 are RNA sensors and can be activated by their respective RNA ligands to induce the downstream cascade pathway. expression plasmids of hemagglutinin-tagged MHV N and flag-tagged RIG-I or MDA5 were co-transfected into HEK-293T cells. at 28 h posttransfection, co-immunoprecipitations were performed with anti-Flag antibodies. MHV N protein antagonizes IFN- production by targeting molecule(s) upstream of RIG-I/MDA5. cells and immunoprecipitation was performed with an anti-Flag antibody. MHV and SARS-CoV N proteins attenuate PACT-mediated activation of the IFN- promoter. hek-293T cells were co-transfected with expression plasmids for RIG-I. the dual-luciferase assays were carried out at 28 h post-transfection. the results represent the means and standard deviation of three independent experiments. MHV and SARS-CoV N proteins bind to PACT. HEK-293T cells were transfected with expression constructs encoding HA-tagged PACT and flag-tagged MHV or SARS-CoV N proteins. cells were lysed at 28 h after transfection and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody. MHV and SARS-CoV N proteins inhibit the interaction between PACT and RIG-I/MDA5. HEK-293T cells were co-transfected with HA-tagged PACT and Flag-tagged RIG-I/MDA5 vectors. twenty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were harvested for immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibodies. both HA-tagged PACT and MDA5 proteins were found to co-precipitate upon detection with anti-HA and anti-Flag antibodies. this indicated that PACT also interact with MDA5. to investigate this interaction, we repeated the co-immunoprecipitation experiment to detect whether N-PACT interactions could also disrupt the PACT-MDA5 association. HEK-293T cells were co-transfected with HA-tagged PACT or plasmids. lysates were immunoprecipitated with poly(I:C)- or poly(C)-coated agarose. lysates and precipitates were subject to immunoblotting analysis. PEDV and PRRSV N proteins do not counteract PACT. MHV and SARS-CoV N proteins were chosen for co-immunoprecipitation experiments. neither PEDV nor PRRSV N protein was present in the PACT precipitates. HEK-293T cells were co-transfected with HA-tagged PACT and Flag-tagged PEDV-N or PRRSV-N. lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation and immunoblot with anti-Flag or/and anti-HA and -actin antibodies. the cells were harvested for immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibodies. HEK-293T cells were transfected with pCMV-tag2b-MHV-N plasmid. the expression of MHV N protein was detected by RT-PCR. the expression of MHV N protein was significantly reduced in MHV N protein-expressing cells. HEK-293T cells were transfected with MHV-N expression plasmid. the cells were then re-infected with VSV-GFP for 24 h. the cells were then re-infected with VSV-GFP for 24 h. HEK-293T cells were transfected or mock transfected with pCMV-tag2b-MHV-N plasmid prior to infection with SEV and VSV-GFP. MHV N protein blocks IFN- production by targeting molecule(s) upstream of RIG-I and MDA5 RIG-I and MDA5 are RNA sensors and can be activated by their respective RNA ligands to induce the downstream cascade pathway. expression plasmids of hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged MHV N and Flag-tagged RIG-I or MDA5 were co-transfected into HEK-293T cells. MHV N protein antagonizes IFN- production by targeting molecule(s) upstream of RIG-I/MDA5. pCAGGS\u2013HA-MHV-N and Flag-RIG-I or -MDA5 vectors were transfected into HEK-293T cells. immunoprecipitation was performed with an anti-Flag antibody. MHV and SARS-CoV N proteins attenuate PACT-mediated activation of the IFN- promoter. HEK-293T cells grown in 24-well plates were transfected with expression plasmids for MHV (A, C) or MDA5 (B, D), PACT, and N proteins from MHV (A, B) or SARS-CoV (C, D) as well as IFN-\u2013Luc and pRL\u2013TK reporter plasmids. HEK-293T cells were transfected with expression plasmids encoding HA-tagged PACT and Flag-tagged MHV or SARS-CoV N proteins. at 28 h after transfection, cells were fixed for IFA to detect PACT (green) and N proteins (red) with anti-HA and anti-Flag antibodies. MHV and SARS-CoV N proteins inhibit the interaction between PACT and RIG-I/MDA5. hek-293T cells were co-transfected with plasmids expressing HA-tagged PACT and Flag-tagged MDA5 vectors. co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed with lysates of co-transfected or single vector HA-tagged PACT and Flag-tagged MDA5 transfected HEK-293T cells. both HA-tagged PACT and MDA5 proteins were found to co-precipitate upon detection with anti-HA and anti-Flag antibodies. this indicated that PACT also interact with MDA5. dsRNA binding activity could also interact with MHV and SARS-CoV N proteins. hek-293T cells were co-transfected with HA-tagged PACT. lysates and precipitates were co-transfected with plasmids expressing HA-tagged PACT or PACT and flag-tagged MHV or SARS-CoV N plasmids. lysates were co-transfected with plasmids expressing HA-tagged PACT or PACT and immunoblot with anti-HA or/and anti-Flag and -actin antibodies. HEK-293T cells were co-transfected with HA-tagged PACT and Flag-tagged PEDV-N or PRRSV-N. the cells were harvested for immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibodies. MHV N protein was responsible for this IFN-antagonizing activity. coV N proteins share a similar overall topology structure and highly conserved function of packaging the viral genome with structural proteins to form ribonucleoprotein complexes for viral assembly. MHV, SARS-CoV, and PEDV N proteins were identified as IFN antagonists. domain 3 of PACT is sufficient for N proteins association, but weakly compared with wild type PACT. PACT can directly interact with the CTD of RIG-I, thus stimulating its ATPase activity. however, MDA5 seems to be lower activated than RIG-I upon PACT stimuli. proteins can be classified into two types: RNA dependent and RNA independent. us11 and VP35 have higher affinities for PACT than RNA. targeting of PACT by ORF4a of MERS-CoV and the N proteins of MHV and SARS-CoV are mediated by RNA. the strategy exploited by both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV M protein is attenuation of the formation of functional TBK1-containing complexes. it would appear that a strategy of tailoring several inhibitors to one target has been adopted. poly(I:C), poly(I) and poly(C)-agaroses were bought from Sigma-Aldrich. mouse monoclonal antibodies against Flag, HA, Myc and -actin were bought from ABclone. mouse monoclonal antibodies against Flag, HA, Myc and -actin were bought from ABclone. pCMV-tag2b-MHV-N was constructed by standard reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assays with specific primers to amplify the cDNA of the MHV N gene from the total RNA extracted from L929 cells infected with MHV A59. pCAGGS\u2013HA-MHV-N, pCAGGS\u2013Myc-MHV-N, pCAGGS\u2013Myc-MHV-N, pCA cells grown in 24-well plates were co-transfected with 0.1 g/well reporter plasmid, 0.02 g/well pRL\u2013TK plasmid (Promega; as an internal control for the normalization of transfection efficiency) the cells were also mock-infected/treated. firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase activities normalized to the Renilla luciferase activities. data are representative of three independently conducted experiments. values of P 0.05 were considered statistically significant. HEK-293T cells were transfected with the appropriate plasmids for 28 h. transfected cells were lysed in 200 L of lysis buffer. cells were boiled at 100\u00b0C for 10 min before separation. indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) HEK-293T cells seeded on microscope coverslips were co-transfected with MHV or SARS-CoV N protein expression plasmid with PACT. at 28 h post-transfection, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, and then permeated with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature. after three washes with PBS poly(I:C)- or poly(C)-coated agarose was set as a negative control. plasmids IFN-\u2013Luc, 4PRDIII/I\u2013Luc and 4PRDII\u2013Luc have been described. pCAGGS\u2013Flag-PEDV-N-encoded PEDV N protein was constructed with specific primers. pCAGGS\u2013HA-PACT was constructed with overlap extension PCR. pCAGGS\u2013HA-PACT was similarly constructed from HEK-293T cell RNA extracts. pCAGGS\u2013HA-PACT was constructed with overlap extension PCR. cells grown in 24-well plates were co-transfected with 0.1 g/well reporter plasmid, 0.02 g/well pRL\u2013TK plasmid. cells were also mock-infected/treated or infected/treated with SEV. data are the relative firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase activities normalized to the Renilla luciferase activities.
