{"summary": "MERS-CoV was first identified in Saudi Arabia in September 2012 as a novel coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory disease. this virus has caused recurrent outbreaks in the Arabian Peninsula and has spread, occasionally, to other parts of the world. 186 people were infected and 36 were killed in one recent outbreak in south Korea. thelial cells and a subset of specialized immune cells are susceptible to MERS-CoV infection. the retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptor (RLR) family is initiated by ubiquitously expressed viral sensors in the retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptor (RLR) family. TBK1/IKK- complex is impeded to ablate the activation of IRF3 transcription factor. a chimeric protein containing the MERS-CoV M protein N-terminal transmembrane domains and a dormant SARS-CoV M protein C-terminal domain was fully competent in IFN antagonism. the expression plasmids for the SN and MN chimeras were constructed by assembly PCR with the forward primers covering the breakpoints. antibodies Mouse anti-FLAG (M2) and anti-actin antibodies were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) cell culture and Sendai virus HEK-293 human embryonic kidney cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. poly(I:C) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and was transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) expression plasmids for TBK1, IRF3 and TRAF3 were generous gifts from Dr Genhong Cheng. those for RIG-I N, IKK- and MAVS and IB- as well as IRF3-luc and B-luc reporter plasmids have been described elsewhere. mouse anti-V5 and anti-HA antibodies were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Rabbit anti-IRF3 and anti-phospho-IRF3 (Ser 386) antibodies were purchased from IBL-America. cell culture and Sendai virus HEK-293 human embryonic kidney cells were maintained in a humidified chamber. MERS-CoV M protein inhibits IFN expression stimulated by Sendai virus infection or poly(I:C) induction. increased doses of MERS M-V5 were transfected into HEK-293 cells. luciferase reporter plasmid was co-transfected with a control luciferase reporter plasmid. cells were challenged with either Sendai virus infection (SeV; 100 hemagglutinating units per mL) in B or poly(I:C) induction (1 L/mL) in C for 16 h before harvest. bars represent the mean of three biological replicates (n=3) and error bars indicate their s.d a canonical NF-B inhibitor IB- (IB) was included as a positive control for the inhibition of NF-B activity. the luciferase construct suppresses IRF3 activation but not NF-B signaling. the activation signal will be mostly unaffected if the activation event mediated by that transducer is downstream of the action point where M protein exerts its inhibitory effect. the activation signal will be mostly unaffected if the activation event mediated by that transducer is downstream of the action point where M protein exerts its inhibitory effect. the inhibitory effect of the MERS-CoV M protein occurs upstream of IRF3 activation. HEK-293 cells were transfected with increasing doses of the MERS M-V5 expression plasmid and a control Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid. bars represent the mean of three biological replicates (n=3) HEK-293 cells were transfected with different combinations of expression plasmids for wild-type IRF3, RIG-I N, and MERS M-V5. hek-293 cells were transfected with different combinations of expression plasmids for wild-type IRF3, RIG-I N, and MERS M-V5. co-immunoprecipitated TBK1 in B, dimeric IRF3 in C or phospho-IRF3 (p-IRF3) in D for each sample was measured using ImageJ software. the physical association of the MERS-CoV M protein with TRAF3 prompted us to test whether the adapter function of TRAF3 would be particularly affected by M protein. IRF3 dimerization visualized by non-denaturing native PAGE is a sensitive assay for evaluating direct IRF3 activation. we ectopically expressed IRF3 and M protein with the inducer RIG-I N in cultured cells and subjected cell lysates directly to native PAGE to check for IRF3 dimerization. we have constructed two truncation mutants for MERS-CoV M protein, an N-terminal transmembrane domain-containing mutant and a C-terminal mutant. neither exhibited an inhibitory effect, possibly due to unstable expression or aberrant localization. cells were collected after 40 h for a double-luciferase reporter assay. bars represent the mean of three biological replicates (n=3) and error bars indicate their s.d. an empty vector was used as a negative control in lane 1. the breakpoint was designed to occur immediately after the third predicted transmembrane domain at residue 106 and before the conserved Ser residue in both proteins at residue 107. we then compared the inhibitory effect of these two chimeras and the full-length M proteins on IFN- expression using the luciferase reporter assay. the first transmembrane domain of the MERS-CoV M protein is fully responsible for its suppression effect32. the truncation mutant, designated SN TM1, contains only the second and the third transmembrane domains of SARS-CoV M protein at the N terminus fused with the C-terminal domain of the SN chimera. M proteins were expressed in advance, a dose-dependent inhibition of IFN- promoter activity was observed. a similar observation was also observed when synthetic dsRNA analog poly(I:C) was used as an alternative inducer that specifically stimulates the RLR pathway of IFN production. MERS-CoV M protein suppresses IRF3 activation but not NF-B signaling. luciferase mutant of RIG-I known as RIG-I N was chosen to be the inducer. active mutant containing the N-terminal domain of RIG-I alone was used as a potent IFN inducer and co-transfected with an M expression plasmid and a firefly luciferase plasmid. a canonical NF-B inhibitor IB- (IB) was included as a positive control for the inhibition of NF-B activity. the inhibitory effect of the M protein occurs upstream of IRF3 activation. a mitochondrial adapter diverts the activation signal from RIG-I to the IRF3 and NF-B pathways. a similar result was obtained using MAVS as an activator. KK- in C and D as well as a dominant-active IRF3 mutant (IRF3 5D) in E. cells were collected after 40 h for a co-immunoprecipitation. HEK-293 cells were transfected with different combinations of expression plasmids for wild-type IRF3, RIG-I N, and MERS M-V5. after 40 h, IRF3 dimerization from cell lysates was visualized by non-denaturing native PAGE followed by western blotting with anti-IRF3 antibodies (D) the detection of TBK1 confirmed the specific recruitment of TBK1 to TRAF3 in the absence of M protein. but when M protein was added to the system, the interaction between TRAF3 and TBK1 was significantly disrupted. we then evaluated whether IRF3 activation would be affected by the expression of M protein. the total IRF3 level expressed in all samples was highly comparable as detected by conventional denaturing SDS-PAGE. this suggests that IRF3 activation was greatly inhibited by the MERS-CoV M protein. phosphorylation was also suppressed with the expression of MERS M protein. an asterisk (*) denotes identical residues. a colon and a period represent amino acids with highly and weakly similar physicochemical properties. the predicted transmembrane domains and the residue numbers at the breakpoints are indicated. chimeric SN full-length (FL) protein and TM1-deletion (TM1) truncation mutant in upper panel. inhibition of IFN- promoter activity by chimeric SN FL or TM1 proteins was measured by luciferase reporter assay in the bottom-left panel. the chimera was capable of suppressing IFN- promoter activity to comparable level. a biochemical assay also confirmed that the MN chimera maintained the ability to interact with the TRAF3 adapter protein in a co-immunoprecipitation experiment. the removal of the first transmembrane domain of SARS-CoV M largely abolished its inhibitory capability. the C-terminal domain of MERS-CoV M protein is devoid of and largely dispensable for the IFN-antagonizing activity of MERS-CoV M protein. phosphorylation and dimerization were affected by the MERS-CoV M protein. the adapter function of TRAF3 in TBK1 recruitment and subsequent IRF3 activation was perturbed by the MERS-CoV M protein. this plausibly contributed to the IFN antagonism of the MERS-CoV M protein. both the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV M proteins were found to suppress IFN production with a highly similar mechanism in which the IRF3-phosphorylating complex of TRAF3TANKTBK1/IKK- was affected by their N-terminal transmembrane domains. the extent by which the M protein suppressed IFN- promoter activity was lower than that by SARS-CoV M protein. this distinguished MERS-CoV M protein from the SARS-Co we have characterized at least three IFN-antagonizing proteins encoded by MERS-CoV. ORF4a is a dsRNA-binding protein, which directly inhibits RLR activation induced by dsRNA."}
