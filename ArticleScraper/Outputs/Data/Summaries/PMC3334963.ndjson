{"summary": "we sequenced RNA from immune-stimulated R. philippinarum hemocytes by 454-pyrosequencing to identify genes involved in their immune defense against infectious diseases. the reads were assembled into 51,265 contigs and the 44.7% of the translated nucleotide sequences into protein were annotated successfully. we have found sequences from molecules never described in bivalves before. the majority of pathologies are associated with the Vibrio and Perkinsus genera. molluscs lack a specific immune system, but the innate response involving circulating hemocytes and a large variety of molecular effectors seems to be an efficient defense method. but not many immune pathways have been identified in these animals. the use of 454-pyrosequencing is a fast and efficient approach for gene discovery and enrichment of transcriptomes in non-model organisms. the aim of this work was to discover new immune-related genes using pyrosequencing on the 454 GS FLX platform with the Titanium reagents. the length of the contigs varied from 40 to 5565 bp, with an average length of 582.4 bp and an average coverage of 5.7 reads. clustering the contigs resulted in 1,689 clusters with more than one contig. the distribution of contig length and the number of ESTs per contig is shown in Figure 2. only 41,598 nucleotide sequences, 362,149 ESTs, 24,139 proteins and 704 genes from the class Bivalvia have been deposited in the GenBank public database. the top entries are for the Mytilus and Crassostrea genera. the species with the most sequence matches was Homo sapiens with 3,106 occurrences. the first bivalve, Meretrix lusoria, appeared at position 17. a high percentage of sequences had homology with chordates, arthropods and gastropods. amebocyte aggregation factor precursor are immune-related proteins present on the top 35 list. numbers refer to the n\u00b0 of occurrences B: Cellular component. C: Molecular function. D: Biological process. numbers in B, C and D refer to the percentage of occurrences. angiopoietin-like proteins, apolipoprotein D and the integral membrane protein 2B play important roles in defense. in other animals, angiopoietin-like proteins (ANGPTL) potently regulate angiogenesis. inflammation occurs via the a5b1 integrin/Rac1/NF-B pathway. apoD induction is specific to ongoing cellular stress. the short form of the integral membrane protein 2B (ITM2Bs) can induce apoptosis via a caspase-dependent mitochondrial pathway. the longest contig of each cluster was used for gene ontology terms assignment. 121,318 from M. galloprovincialis and 1,034,379 from L. elliptica. the other three species are bivalves that have been studied in transcriptomic assays. the number of coincidences among other groups was very low. 44% of our total results (13,059 clusters) were found in Milan et al. study. 56% of our total clusters (16,620) represent new information about Manila clam transcriptome.

ESTs with homology to the C1q domain have been detected in the American oyster, C. virginica, the tropical clam Codakia orbicularis, the tropical clam Codakia orbicularis and the Zhikong scallop Chlamys farreri. the complement pathway in R. philippinarum was almost complete as compared to the KEGG reference pathway. only the complement components C1r, C1s, C6, C7 and C8 were not detected. glucan recognition proteins are involved in the recognition of invading fungal organisms. they bind specifically to -1,3-glucan stimulating short-term immune responses. two contigs with homology to the beta-1,3-glucan-binding protein were found. the exact role of TLR13 is currently unknown. phylogenic analysis indicates that TLR13 is a member of the TLR11 subfamily [54] suggesting that it could recognize urinary pathogenic E. coli [55]. some genes encoding protease inhibitors were identified in C. gigas [57], A. irradians [58], C. farreri [59] and C. virginica. antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are small, gene-encoded, cationic peptides that constitute important innate immune effectors from organisms spanning most of the phylogenetic spectrum. AMPs alter the permeability of the pathogen membrane and cause cellular lysis [63] in bivalves, they were first purified from mussel hemocyte granules [64], [65]. the most important and well-studied groups of HSPs were present in our R. philippinarum transcriptome (HSP27, HSP40/DnaJ, HSP70 and HSP90), but other, less common HSPs were also represented. numbers refer to the n\u00b0 of occurrences.

Lysozyme is a key protein in the innate immune responses of invertebrates against Gram-negative bacterial infections. angiopoietin-like proteins (ANGPTL) potently regulate angiogenesis, but a subset also function in energy metabolism. angPTL2 promotes vascular inflammation rather than angiogenesis in skin and adipose tissues. a total of 23.05% of the representative clusters matched with at least one GO term. the highest percentage of GO terms were in the groups of cell and cell part with 25.9% in each. cellular and metabolic processes were the highest represented groups. of the total 29,679 clusters, 72% were found exclusively in the R. philippinarum group, while only 7.59% shared significant similarity with all five species. the percentage of new sequences is very low compared to previous transcriptomic studies [33]\u2013[34], in which the fraction of new transcripts was approximately 45%. a keyword list and GO immune-related terms were used to find proteins putatively involved in the immune system. some sequences were found to be clustered in common, well-recognized immune pathways, such as the complement, apoptosis and toll-like receptors pathways.

ESTs from C. gigas, M. galloprovincialis, L. elliptica and B. azoricus were obtained from GenBank and from dedicated databases. BLASTn compared the longest contig from each of 29,679 R. philippinarum clusters with a cut off e-value of 10e-05. of 2,005 clusters identified as immune-related and the Milan et al. contigs as well. the percentage of coverage is the average % of query coverage by the best blast hit. the percentage of hits is the % of query with at least one hit in database, in parenthesis were added the total number of hits. hemocytes were acclimatized to aquaria conditions for one week. a total of 100 clams were notched in the shell in the area adjacent to the anterior adductor muscle. a sample of 500 ul of hemolymph was withdrawn from the adductor muscle of each clam. the RNA quality was assessed in a Bioanalyzer 2010 (Agilent Technologies) from each sample, 1 g of RNA was pooled and used for the production of normalized cDNA for 454 sequencing in the Unitat de Genmica. the amplified cDNA was normalized using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen USA, Valencia, CA) 454 Sequencing is based on sequencing-by-synthesis, addition of one nucleotide, or more, complementary to the template strand results in a chemiluminescent signal. the signal strength is proportional to the number of nucleotides incorporated in a single nucleotide flow. cDNA fraction was amplified twice by sequential PCR reactions. cDNA was fractionated into small, 300- to 800-basepair fragments. the specific A and B adaptors were ligated to both the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends of the fragments. the 51,265 contigs were grouped into a total of 29,679 clusters. two sequences were grouped if at least 60% of the positions had at least 95% identity. an iterative blast workflow was used to annotate the R. philippinarum contigs with at least 100 bp (49,847 contigs out of 51,265) unique sequences from these databases (based on gi number) were used from each of the databases. the comparison between our 454 results, the longest contig from each of 29,679 R. philippinarum clusters, and the Milan et al. contigs. non-selected contigs were checked to identify putative immune-related contigs. the remaining non-selected contigs were revised using the GO terms at level 2, 3 and 4 assigned to each sequence."}
