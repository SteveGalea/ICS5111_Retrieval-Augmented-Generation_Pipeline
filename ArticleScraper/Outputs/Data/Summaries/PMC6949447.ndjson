{"summary": "viral pneumonia may be underrecognized and misdiagnosed as certain ILDs. the most common ILD-related misdiagnoses were AFOP/COP/CEP. the most common ILD-related misdiagnoses were AFOP/COP/CEP. common radiologic patterns of viral pneumonia include patchy bilateral ground-glass opacities (GGOs) and consolidation, which may become confluent. common radiologic patterns of viral pneumonia include patchy bilateral ground-glass opacities (GGOs) the kit detects influenza A and B viruses; coronaviruses (CoV) NL63, 229E, OC43, and HKU1; human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV) 1, 2, 3, and 4; human metapneumovirus A/B; rhinovirus; respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A/B; adenovirus; enterovirus; bocavirus; and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. a multidisciplinary diagnosis of viral pneumonia was made based on a positive virus PCR result, a compatible clinical course, and histological and radiological findings. patients with a diagnosis of AFOP, COP, or chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (CEP) were classified into the same category because of their overlapping histological patterns (3). statistical analysis The demographic characteristics and laboratory measurements at the time of presentation were compared between the viral pneumonia and non-viral pneumonia groups. the interobserver reliability of the radiological findings was evaluated using the kappa coefficient () and was defined as poor (0.00), slight (0.00-0.20), fair (0.21-0.40), moderate (0.41-0.60), substantial (0.61-0.80), and almost perfect (0.81-1.00). all patients underwent BAL for diagnostic purposes. diagnosis included AIP (n=8), AFOP/COP/CEP (n=33), pneumonia (n=24), DILD (n=19), CTD-ILD (n=15), unclassifiable IP (n=4), acute hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) and acute eosinophilic pneumonia (n=2). patients with a final diagnosis of viral pneumonia had been diagnosed on discharge as having COP/CEP/AFOP (n=22), AIP (n=5), CTD-ILD (n=3), unclassifiable IP (n=2), pneumonia (n=20), and DILD (n=1) PCR testing was positive in 60 of the patients, among whom. final diagnosis included viral pneumonia in 53 patients and diseases other than viral pneumonia in 56 patients. unclassifiable IP (n=2); AFOP, COP, or CEP (n=1); radiation-primed OP after breast cancer (n=1); AEP (n=3); AHP (n=3); CTD-ILD [n=12; polymyositis (n=3); amyopathic dermatomyositis with MDA5 antibody (n= acute interstitial pneumonia (AIP) (n=5), connective tissue disease (CTD) -related interstitial lung disease (ILD) (n=3), unclassified interstitial pneumonia (n=2), pneumonia (n=20), and drug-induced ILD (n=1) among the 40 control BALF samples obtained from patients with chronic lung diseases, 3 (7.5%) patients had positive viral PCR results (HPeV in a patient with sarcoidosis, rhinovirus in hMPV+HPeV, n=1; hMPV+HPIV, n=1; hMPV+HPIV, n=1; hMPV+HPIV, n=1; hMPV+HPIV, n=1; hMPV+HPIV, n=1; hMPV+HPIV, n=1; hMPV+HPIV, n=1; hMPV+HPIV, n* (%) Coronavirus 20 (37.7) Human parechovirus 18 (34.0) Respiratory syncytial virus 15 (28.3) Human parainfluenza virus1 15 (28.3) Rhinovirus 14 (26.4) Influenza virus 13 (24.5) Human metapneumovirus2 10 (18.9) Adenovirus 3 (5.7) Influenza B virus 1 (1.9) Coinfection with bacteria 6 (11.3) * Indicates number of patients with each detected virus. histological findings obtained via surgical lung biopsy showed organization, swollen pneumocytes, and pulmonary edema (f). the photos of histological specimens in panels d, e, and f correspond to the patients in panels a, b, and c. median (range) duration from the onset of symptoms to admission of the 53 patients with viral pneumonia was 11.0 (0-30) days. chronic kidney disease 4 (7.5%) 2 (3.6%) 0.4294 Chronic liver disease 1 (1.9%) 1 (1.8%) 1.0000 Connective tissue diseases 1 (1.9%) 13 (23.2%) 0.0010 Malignancy 1 (1.9%) 0 (0.0%) 0.4862 None 22 (41.5%) 16 (28.6%) 0.1665 Smoking history 36 (67.9%) 27 (48.2%) 0.0521 Duration from initial symptoms to admission (days) Mean (SD) 13.9 (9.09) 14.5 (8.5 white blood cell counts and serum procalcitonin value were 9,000 (2,400-27,200)/mm3 and 9.85 (0.09-46.8) mg/dL. serum liver transaminase and CRP values were higher in patients with viral pneumonia than in those with other diseases. fraction of eosinophils in BALF was lower in patients with viral pneumonia than in those with other diseases.

PCR tests using BALF were useful and are recommended for the diagnosis of primary influenza viral pneumonia. in previous adult studies, viruses were detected in 0.4-4.2% of asymptomatic patients. the efficacy of NIs is partially reported in influenza-associated pneumonia (25), NIs were effective in some of our patients. it is recommended that NIs be administered within 48 hours from the onset of symptoms; however, NIs administered after this 48-h period were effective in some of our patients. corticosteroids were administered without NIs to 6 patients. they were effective in the other 20 patients. the significance of corticosteroid therapy for viral pneumonia should be addressed in future studies. clinical symptoms and laboratory findings were not diagnostic for viral pneumonia. significant numbers of patients with viral pneumonia may be misdiagnosed with ILDs, especially AFOP, COP, and CEP."}
