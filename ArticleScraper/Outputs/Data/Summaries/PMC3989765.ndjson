{"summary": "in the late 1960s, researchers estimated that the human genome may contain up to two million protein-coding genes. in 2012, an in vitro gene expression analysis yielded a number of 20,687 protein-coding genes (Pennisi, 2012) several hundred of these genes are interferon-stimulated genes that are upregulated during viral infections. the number of human genes is not significantly larger than that of many less complex organisms such as Caenorhabditis elegans or Drosophila melanogaster. alternative pre-mRNA splicing, DNA rearrangement, post-translational modifications, and the use of alternative start codons are means to increase the coding potential of genes. tetherin is a type II transmembrane protein consisting of a short N-terminal domain followed by an alpha-helical transmembrane domain, a labile coiled-coil ectodomain and a C-terminal glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchor. this unusual topology with two membrane anchors is only shared with a special form of the prion protein. conserved cystein residues that form disulfide bridges are shown in pink and gray. a unique stretch of EQ repeats in the hamster ortholog is marked in green. deletions and truncations in the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain are shown in yellow. ILT7 forms a complex with FcRI, which contains a cytoplasmic ITAM. Tetherin forms a picket fence around lipid rafts and links them to the underlying actin cytoskeleton via RICH2/EBP50/Ezrin. tetherin homodimers are characterized by a parallel dimeric coiled-coil over the C-terminal two-thirds of the ectodomain. the N-terminal third may form an antiparallel four-helix bundle with another dimer, creating a tetherin tetramer. tetherin is trapped in the ER in cells that have defects in the GPI-biosynthetic pathway. the GPI-anchor serves as subcellular localization signal and targets tetherin to cholesterol-rich microdomains. tetherin is most likely located outside lipid rafts with the cytosolic domain being a membrane microdomain exclusion motif. tetherin expression levels are markedly upregulated upon viral infection. protein levels correlate with viral loads both in HIV-infected humans and simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV)-infected macaques. tetherin is more widely expressed and can be detected to high levels in hepatocytes, pneumocytes, activated T cells, monocytes, pDCs, ducts of major salivary glands, pancreas and kidney cells, vascular endothelium, and many other cell types. tetherin was previously described as an interferon-inducible gene in the 1990s. antiviral activity depends on the unusual topology of tetherin. tetherin dimers adopt a parallel configuration with a three- to five-fold preference for the insertion of the GPI-anchor rather than the transmembrane domain into virions. tetherin accumulates at HIV budding sites with around four to seven molecules per assembly cluster. tetherin mutants lacking either the GPI-anchor or the transmembrane domain are non-functional. this protein is part of an enzyme complex that catalyzes the first step of the GPI-anchor synthesis. mutations in PIGL cause the CHIME syndrome that is characterized by colobomas, heart defects, ichthyosiform dermatosis. tetherin restricts budding of members of alpha-, beta-, gamma-, deltaretroviruses, lentiviruses, and spumaviruses. studies using replication competent viruses revealed that tetherin restricts budding of members of alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and deltaretroviruses. restriction of virion release is not the only antiviral activity of tetherin. tetherin was identified in an over-expression screening for activators of NF-B. this raised the possibility that tetherin may act as a PRR inducing an antiviral immune response upon binding of budding progeny virions. tetherin contains a putative TRAF binding site [PxExx(Ar/Ac)] in its N-terminal cytoplasmic domain. mutation of the dual tyrosine motif YxYxx abrogated the signaling activity of tetherin. however, endocytosis is not required for efficient NF-B activation. tetherin has also been shown to directly interact with the immunoglobulin-like transcript 7 (ILT7, LILRA4, CD85g) on pDCs. binding of tetherin to ILT7 may induce a negative feedback signaling to prevent an uncontrolled prolonged inflammatory response. however, a recent study by Tavano et al. (2013) has challenged this hypothesis. the protein RICH2 binds to the cytoplasmic dual tyrosine motif of tetherin and to EBP50, thereby linking it to Ezrin and the apical actin cytoskeleton. the adaptor protein binding site is masked in this process and RICH2 binding prevents clathrin-mediated endocytosis of tetherin. hamster tetherin is preferentially localized to the Golgi apparatus rather than the plasma membrane. the overall topology of the protein is conserved and a certain amount of GREG can also be detected at the plasma membrane. a similar phenotype was observed in cells lacking PIGL. tetherin ectodomain dimers are similar to that formed by BAR-domains. it is tempting to speculate that the extracellular part of tetherin may perform similar activities that are involved in the sensing of budding virions and/or Golgi structure. tetherin accumulates at HIV budding sites with around four to seven molecules per assembly cluster. an artificial tetherin molecule consisting of the transmembrane domain of the transferrin receptor, the coiled-coil ectodomain of the dystrophia myotonica protein kinase (DMPK) was able to restrict the release of budding virions. paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a syndrome that is most commonly caused by mutations in phosphatidylinositol glycan A. mutations in PIGL cause the CHIME syndrome that is characterized by colobomas, heart defects, ichthyosiform dermatosis. viruses that bud from intracellular membranes are also restricted by tetherin. effect of tetherin on HCV replication is still controversial. tetherin may act as a PRR inducing an antiviral immune response upon binding of budding progeny virions. the presence of the GPI-anchor, for example, is essential for inhibition of virion release but dispensable for signaling. disruption of the tetramerization motif specifically disrupts signaling. the short isoform of tetherin fails to act as an innate sensor. it is probably only homodimers of the long isoform that activate NF-B. it is likely that the two N-terminal tyrosine residues in homodimers are phosphorylated upon virion sensing to recruit the first components of the NF-B signaling cascade. antibody-mediated crosslinking of ILT7 significantly suppressed IFN production by pDCs a modulation of IFN production by tetherin was not observed in their experimental setup. binding of ILT7 to tetherin may also activate tetherin-mediated NF-B signaling. tetherin does not only act as an anchor and stabilizer of the apical actin network but also appears to be involved in the regulation of Rho-GTPases. tetherin may also serve as a picket fence stabilizing and organizing membrane microdomains. hamster tetherin is conserved and a certain amount of GREG can be detected at the plasma membrane. a similar phenotype was observed in cells lacking PIGL. a model has been proposed in which opposing membranes within a cisterna are linked by GREG dimers. tetherin is under high selection pressure and residues in all three domains have been shown to be under positive selection. seven very rare non-synonymous SNPs have been described in human tetherin (Y8H, R19H, N49S, D103N, E117A, D129E, and V146L) the long isoform lacks the dual tyrosine motif required for activation of NF-B signaling and binding of RICH2. a short cytoplasmic tail may confer a selective advantage because it reduces the number of target sites for potential viral antagonists. only human tetherin and (to a lesser extent) chimpanzee tetherin have been shown to perform this function. sheep, goats, and cows encode two tetherin variants implying a gene duplication event before the divergence of these ruminants. both proteins (BST-2A and BST-2B) are able to inhibit the release of budding virions, although they may be differentially expressed in various cell types. residues within and adjacent to a highly conserved [D/E]xxxLL motif in the C-loop of Nef are critical for its anti-tetherin activity. these mutations specifically disrupted the downmodulation of tetherin. tetherin is resistant against Nef-mediated counteraction. tetherin is indicated in blue, the viral antagonists are shown in red. HIV-1 Vpu and HHV-8 K5 induce the ubiquitination. the mechanism of Ebola Gp-mediated tetherin antagonism remains unclear. an AxxxAxxxAxxxW face in the transmembrane domain of M Vpu is essential for the counteraction of human tetherin. it remains unclear whether these residues directly interact with the transmembrane domain of tetherin or rather confer stability to the alpha-helical structure of the transmembrane domain. the absence of putative ubiquitination sites in the short isoform of tetherin may explain its relative resistance against Vpu. tetherin enters the ESCRT-dependent endolysosomal pathway upon ubiquitination. a similar DxxxLV motif evolved in the Vpu of a recently isolated highly pathogenic HIV-1 group N strain. most of the previously characterized HIV-1 N Vpus do not contain a DxxxLV motif in their cytoplasmic domain. this poor anti-tetherin activity of HIV-1 group N viruses could be a reason for their very limited spread in the human population. interaction with tetherin occurs very likely via the ectodomain of Env. most assays were performed with Env alleles from HIV-2 group A strains. it remains unclear whether other HIV-2 groups also evolved Env-mediated anti-tetherin activity. in 2006, tetherin was identified in a screen for factors that are downmodulated by the RING-CH ubiquitin ligase K5 of the Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus. it soon became clear that HHV-8 utilizes K5 to ensure efficient virion release by inducing the degradation of tetherin. the exact mechanism of Gp-mediated counteraction of tetherin remains unclear. it has been suggested that tetherin interacts directly with the GP2 subunit. similar mechanism has also been proposed for FIV Env. some viruses may even exploit tetherin for their own benefit. HTLV-1 infected cells produce tetherin-containing extracellular viral assemblies that are transferred to neighboring cells. tetherin has also been suggested to enhance the entry of human cytomegaloviruses. tetherin is resistant against Nef-mediated counteraction. tetherin is indicated in blue, the viral antagonists are shown in red. tetherin is indicated in blue, the viral antagonists are shown in red. HIV-1 Vpu and HHV-8 K5 induce the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the restriction factor. the mechanism of Ebola Gp-mediated tetherin antagonism is still unclear. ane domain of HIV-1 group M Vpu is essential for the counteraction of human tetherin. it remains unclear whether these residues directly interact with the transmembrane domain of tetherin or confer stability to the alpha-helical structure of the transmembrane domain. it is now quite well established that both proteins interact in the TGN. some reports suggest that tetherin enters the ESCRT-dependent endolysosomal pathway upon ubiquitination. the presence of a TrCP- consensus sequence (DSGxxS) is not absolutely required for efficient anti-tetherin activity. a recently isolated highly pathogenic HIV-1 group N strain counteracted human tetherin as efficiently as pandemic HIV-1 group M Vpus. most of the previously characterized HIV-1 N Vpus do not contain a DxxxLV motif in their cytoplasmic domain and counteract tetherin only inefficiently. this poor anti-tetherin activity of HIV-1 group N viruses could be a reason for their very limited spread in the human population. ctodomain of Env depends on an endocytic motif in gp41. it remains unclear whether other HIV-2 groups also evolved Env-mediated anti-tetherin activity. a substantial number of enveloped viruses have evolved antagonists of this restriction factor. the RING-CH ubiquitin ligase K5 of the Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus is downmodulated by the RING-CH ubiquitin ligase K5. HHV-8 uses K5 to ensure efficient virion release by inducing the degradation of tetherin. FIV Env incorporation is required to antagonize feline tetherin. however, it does not involve a reduction of total or surface tetherin levels. a similar mechanism has also been proposed for FIV Env. tetherin has been suggested to enhance the entry of human cytomegaloviruses and to be required for efficient FIV particle release. viruses have evolved a multiplicity of mechanisms to counteract, evade or even hijack the restriction imposed by tetherin. non-pandemic HIV-1 groups N, O, and P strains failed to evolve efficient tetherin antagonists after cross-species transmissions of SIV to humans. notably, however, patients infected with non-pandemic HIV-1 strains develop high viral loads and ultimately progress to AIDS. presence of Vpu did not or only slightly enhance the cytopathicity of HIV-1 in humanized mouse models. effective counteraction of tetherin may confer a selective advantage during all stages of viral infection. tetherin may still restrict direct cell-to-cell spread of HIV-1. tetherin knockout mice infected with Moloney MLV progressed to disease faster than their wild type littermates. tetherin knockout mice express only the short form of tetherin which lacks the tyrosine-based endocytosis signal and is therefore expressed to higher levels at the cell surface. mouse models cannot fully recapitulate all characteristics of human tetherin. conflict of interest statement The author declares that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
