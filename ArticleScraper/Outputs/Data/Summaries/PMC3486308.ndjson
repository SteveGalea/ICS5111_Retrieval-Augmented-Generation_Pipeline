{"summary": "the etiological agent was shown to be SARS coronavirus (11, 23, 37) it is a new type of enveloped virus belonging to the Coronaviridae family. the spike, located on the viral surface, is composed of a trimer of S glycoprotein (S protein) and is important for viral entry into target cells. s calreticulin and ERp57 transiently bind to newly synthesized polypeptides containing monoglucosylated N-glycan side chains. the -glycosidase inhibitors disrupt the interaction of calnexin with its substrate proteins by interrupting glycan chain processing of immature glycoproteins. all experiments using SARS-CoV were performed in biosafety level 3 (BSL3) level facilities. all experiments using SARS-CoV were performed in biosafety level 3 (BSL3) level facilities. resulting hybridomas were screened for their ability to bind to recombinant S2-N protein by conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. monoclonal antibodies against calnexin were purchased, as were anticalreticulin, antiactin, anti-c-myc, and anti-p24 (Chemicon) antibodies. the beads were washed 4 times with 20 mM HEPES\u20131% Triton X-100\u20131% CHAPS. they were suspended in buffer containing sodium dodecyl sulfate. the gels were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue. the plates were incubated for 1 h at room temperature, washed with PBS-T, and incubated sequentially with rabbit anticalnexin antibody and anti-rabbit\u2013horseradish peroxidase. after the addition of stop solution, the absorbance in each well was measured at 450 nm and at 620 nm as a reference using an Infinite 200 plate reader (Tecan) three washes with PBS-T, the cells were mounted and viewed using an Olympus microscope and software DP controller to capture images. HEK293T cells were mixed with each siRNA and Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) and seeded onto poly-d-lysine plates. free S-pseudovirus was removed, culture medium was added, and the cells were incubated for 2 days. the cells were lysed with PicaGene reporter lysis buffer (Toyo B-Net) and centrifuged to remove debris. the cells were mixed with PicaGene (Toyo B-Net) substrate. S-pseudoviruses were purified by ultracentrifugation at 40,000 rpm for 1 h at 4\u00b0C in an SW55Ti rotor. each sample was gently harvested into 16 tubes, each of which was again ultracentrifuged for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. HEK293T cells transfected with a plasmid carrying the S protein gene were cultured for 2 days in DMEM\u201310%FCS containing -glycosidase inhibitors. cells were detached and washed with PBS() several times. each homogenate was clarified by centrifugation at 3,500 rpm for 10 min at 4\u00b0C and at 16,000 rpm for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. the virus was adsorbed onto a vero E6 monolayer for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. the cells were stained with 2.5% crystal violet solution in 30% ethanol and 1% ammonium oxalate. each pellet was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 5 h at 4\u00b0C. a plasmid carrying the human codon-optimized S protein gene of SARS-CoV (47) was kindly provided by G. J. Nabel of the National Institute of Health (Bethesda, MD) DNA fragments carrying S2-N and S protein mutant genes were amplified by PCR and introduced into pcDNA6/Myc/His A. monoclonal antibody to S protein (Chemicon) was used for flow cytometry analysis. monoclonal antibodies against calnexin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Inc., and Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. beads were washed 4 times with 20 mM HEPES\u20131% Triton X-100\u20131% CHAPS. the beads were suspended in buffer containing sodium dodecyl sulfate. the gels were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue. the wells were washed with PBS-T and incubated with rabbit anticalnexin antibody and anti-rabbit\u2013horseradish peroxidase. after the addition of stop solution, the absorbance in each well was measured at 450 nm and at 620 nm as a reference using an Infinite 200 plate reader (Tecan) HEK293T cells were mixed with each siRNA and Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) after incubation for 2 days, the cells were transfected with plasmids for S-pseudovirus production. DMEM was added to remove free S-pseudovirus plasmids. eudovirus was purified by ultracentrifugation at 30,000 rpm for 1 h at 4\u00b0C in an SW55Ti rotor. cells were lysed with PicaGene reporter lysis buffer (Toyo B-Net) and centrifuged to remove debris. S-pseudoviruses were purified by ultracentrifugation at 40,000 rpm for 1 h at 4\u00b0C in an SW55Ti rotor. each of the 16 tubes was again ultracentrifuged at 30,000 rpm for 1 h at 4\u00b0C in a TLA45 rotor (Beckman Coulter) to assess their infectivities. HEK293T cells transfected with a plasmid carrying the S protein gene were cultured for 2 days in DMEM\u201310%FCS containing -glycosidase inhibitors. each homogenate was clarified by centrifugation at 3,500 rpm for 10 min at 4\u00b0C and 16,000 rpm for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. the virus was adsorbed onto a vero E6 monolayer for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. the cells were stained with 2.5% crystal violet solution in 30% ethanol and 1% ammonium oxalate. each pellet was suspended in PBS(), centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 5 h at 4\u00b0C, and suspended in 2 SDS-PAGE loading buffer. the association between S2-N and calnexin was direct and dose dependent. surface plasmon response analysis also showed that their association was direct and dose dependent. truncated mutants of both proteins were used for immunoprecipitation assays. Lysates of HEK293T cells transfected with plasmids carrying full-length S protein and truncated calnexin mutant genes were used for immunoprecipitation assays with anti-S protein antibody. calnexin mutants bound to full-length S protein. in, and bound calnexin was measured by ELISA. each assay was performed in triplicate. results are presented as means standard deviation (SD) concentrated S-pseudoviruses were treated with calnexin siRNA-treated cells. they were treated with PNGase F, which removes all types of N-glycan chains from glycoproteins, and endo H, which removes only high-mannose structures and hybrid structures from glycoproteins. calnexin siRNA-treated cells contain more hybrid and high-mannose N-glycan chains than S proteins from untreated and control siRNA-treated cells. expression of endogenous calnexin in HEK293T cells treated with calnexin and control siRNAs. black bars, hatched bars indicate the S-pseudovirus from untreated cells, control siRNA-treated cells, and calnexin siRNA-treated cells. the luciferase activity of each cell lysate was measured. assays were performed in quadruplicate. es treated with or without PNGase F gradually decreased in a time-dependent manner. the decline in S-pseudovirus infectivity was also dependent on the concentration of PNGase F. analysis of concentrated S-pseudoviruses showed each -glucosidase inhibitor significantly and dose dependently reduced the incorporation of S protein into S-pseudoviruses. the upper band of the S protein doublet was dose dependently reduced and the lower band was shifted upward. S protein in cells producing S-pseudovirus in the presence of -glucosidase inhibitors was concentrated by ultracentrifugation and analyzed by Western blotting. the number 1, 2, and 3 in the concentration column represent 0, 1, and 10 g/ml, respectively, of NN-DNJ and 0, 10, and 100 g/ml, respectively, of both NB-DNJ and castanospermine. NN-DNJ dose dependently shifted the mobility of S protein upward, similar to the case for the S protein of S-pseudovirus produced by HEK293T cells in the presence of -glucosidase inhibitors. the association between S2-N and calnexin was direct and dose dependent. full-length S protein colocalized with endogenous calnexin in wild type MEFs. truncated mutants of both proteins were used for immunoprecipitation assays. the S2-N region (residues 620 to 900) and the RBD (residues 318 to 510) are shown as gray and hatched bars. black bars show the putative N-glycosylation sites in the S1 and S2 domains. immunoprecipitation assays using HEK293T cell lysates containing full-length S protein and endogenous calreticulin. cell lysates were mixed with antibody to S protein (+)., protein G-Sepharose without antibody. direct dose-dependent association between recombinant S2-N and calnexin. -pseudoviruses from untreated and control siRNA-treated cells were analyzed. a single S protein band was observed when S-pseudoviruses were produced by untreated and control siRNA-treated cells. multiple S protein bands, with higher mobility, were observed when S-pseudovirus was produced by calnexin siRNA-treated cells. untreated and control siRNA-treated cells were smaller than those of S protein treated with PNGase F or endo H. both S proteins have a larger number of complex N-glycan chains than hybrid and high-mannose N-glycan chains. Concentrated S-pseudovirus (180 ng of p24 protein) was layered onto a 20 to 60% sucrose gradient and ultracentrifuged. each aliquot was again ultracentrifuged and analyzed by Western blotting. infectivities of both S-pseudoviruses treated with or without PNGase F decreased in a time-dependent manner. decline in S-pseudovirus infectivity was also dependent on concentration of PNGase F. -glucosidase inhibitors NN-DNJ, NB-DNJ, and castanospermine inhibit the interactions of calnexin with its substrates in the ER by interrupting glycan chain processing of immature glycoproteins. each -glucosidase inhibitor significantly and dose dependently reduced the incorporation of S protein into S-pseudoviruses. udovirus (10 ng of p24 protein) produced by HEK293T cells in the presence of the indicated concentrations (g/ml) of NN-DNJ, NB-DNJ, and castanospermine infected ACE2-expressing cells. luciferase activity of the cell lysate was measured. in the presence of NN-DNJ was significantly and dose dependently less infectious than virus generated in the absence of NN-DNJ. NB-DNJ and castanospermine did not significantly reduce the numbers of plaques, but these plaques were smaller than those observed in the absence of these inhibitors. Western blotting showed that NN-DNJ dramatically and dose dependently reduced the amounts of S protein and nucleoprotein. calnexin bound to all truncated S proteins except for S2-C, suggesting that S protein may indirectly interact with actin through calnexin. the presence of many glycosylation sites in S protein is consistent with our Western blot results with cell lysates. in the absence of both PNGase F and endo H, the S protein from calnexin knockdown cells consisted of multiple bands with smearing, whereas the S proteins from untreated and control siRNA-treated cells were each single bands. however, with PNGase F treatment, the band mobilities of those three S proteins were identical, suggesting that excess amounts of S proteins were incorporated into the former virus particles. the secretion of immature glycoprotein is enhanced in calnexin-deficient Saccharomyces cerevisiae (1, 36) in the process of maturation of newly synthesized proteins, posttranslational modification with N-glycan is closely involved in protein folding. calnexin knockdown cells would be misfolded because calnexin is one of the central players in the ER quality control. -glucosidase inhibitors affected the amount of S protein in S-pseudovirus, in the ER, and on the cell surface but not in cell lysates. calnexin binds to S protein possessing monoglycosylated N-glycans. this monitoring would remove improperly glycosylated and incorrectly folded S proteins. er -glucosidases I and II, the targets of the -glucosidase inhibitors, remove terminal glucose residues stepwise from N-glycan chains attached to nascent glycoproteins. disappearance of the upper band in the S protein doublet and upward shifting of the lower band were dependent on the concentration of -glucosidase inhibitors. s may lead to the development of anti-SARS-CoV drugs."}
