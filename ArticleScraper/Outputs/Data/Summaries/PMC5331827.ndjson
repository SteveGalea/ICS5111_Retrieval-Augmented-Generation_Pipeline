{"summary": "arterivirus genetic diversity was recently classified into 14 species (3). five of the newly identified viruses include equine arteritis virus (EAV) (4, 5), lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) (6, 7), simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV) (8), porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus 1 (9), and PRRSV-2 (10). replication encoded in the first two ORFs, ORF1a and ORF1b. capsid proteins controlling virus dissemination encoded in downstream ORFs. pp1a and pp1ab are co- and posttranslationally processed by viral proteases. nsp1-nsp2 is one of the two largest arterivirus proteins. it includes a multifunctional Zn-binding PLP2 domain at the N terminus and adjacent transmembrane (TM1) and Cys-rich (CR) domains at the C terminus. the scale of variation in the nsp1 coding region is even larger. it may encode either one (nsp1; EAV), two (nsp1a and nsp1b; LDV and PRRSV-1 and -2), or three (nsp1a, nsp1b, and nsp1c; SHFV) proteins. the name of each PLP includes a suffix matching that in the name of the nsp in sp1a of the characterized arteriviruses also includes an N-terminal Zn finger (ZnF) domain (37) all three domains of nsp1 are important for template-specific complex regulation of subgenomic mRNA production (transcription) and virion biogenesis in EAV. analysis of tertiary structure and biochemical characterization of nsp1b revealed a small domain with weak nuclease activity residing upstream of the available WPDV sequence, obtained using a classic 5\u2032 rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) protocol, comprised 10,087 nucleotides (nt), which included the published partial sequence of 9,509 nt. however, analysis of this sequence suggested that it may still lack the 5\u2032-terminal region which encodes nsp1-nsp2 in other arteriviruses. the longest PCR product obtained in RACE 2 extended the assembly by 808 nt. small bands of about 250 bp were amplified following seminested PCRs. both bands contained the same sequence, which aligned with the existing WPDV sequence but did not extend it. one of the primary PCRs (lane 3) using the RACE.outer/WPD.S5.R primer pair and target-enriched cDNA captured on streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. Lane 2 represents an unsuccessful 5\u2032 RLM RACE reaction with a different source of starting material. lane 2 represents an unsuccessful 5\u2032 RLM RACE reaction with a different source of starting material. ed by a 245-nt 5\u2032 untranslated region (5\u2032-UTR) and a 97-nt 3\u2032-UTR (Table 1). To facilitate analysis of the nsp1-nsp2 genomic region, we reconstructed the phylogeny of arteriviruses using multiple-sequence alignment (MSA) of seven conserved nsp domains. a large Bayesian sample of rooted trees revealed well-resolved branches for all viruses except APRAV and simian hemorrhagic encephalitis virus. phylogeny is presented by a posterior sample of phylogenetic trees, reconstructed by BEAST software. genome organization, polyprotein processing scheme, and polyprotein domains used for phylogeny reconstruction are shown in the bottom left corner for PRRSV-2 (accession number NC_001961.1) the domain organization of nsp1-nsp2 is shown for each arterivirus species. bar representing the PLP1 domains of WPDV has dark green stripes to emphasize its affinity with PLP1c. delineated species were further grouped into five clusters. all poorly characterized viruses of the simian clade adopted the domain organization described for SHFV. the most informative comparisons were profile comparisons of most diverse simian clades. simian clade and other clades ranked in descending order LDV-PRRSV > APRAV > EAV > WPDV. this ranking was in agreement with the phylogenetic relationships of the clades. support was obtained for the conservation of ZnF and \u201cnuclease\u201d domains in all viruses except for EAV and WPDV. the plots shown are HHalign dot plots, with domains and viruses indicated on the respective axes. the color of each line indicates the probability of the hit. on the right side of each plot, the probability and E value of the top-scoring hit are depicted. the most significant similarity was that between PLP1b variants of the simian and LDV-PRRSV clades. the enzymatically active PLP of EAV (known as PLP1b) was most similar to simian PLP1c rather than to simian PLP1c variants of different origins. the only notable exception to the domain-clade association was EAV PLP1b, which was basal to either PLP1c (70.26% of trees) or PLP1b and PLP1c (23.36% of trees), and this was also sustained in the comparable tree including WPDV. these results combined strongly suggested an orthologous relationship between PLP1b variants of the simian, LDV-PRRSV, and APRAV clades but not that of EAV. these MSAs were then compared with the N-terminal 1,096 aa of WPDV pp1a/pp1ab in the profile-profile mode by using HHalign. significant similarities were observed for the PLP2 (8.4e06) and TM1-CR (1.7e23) domains, which were much stronger than those observed using simian-based profiles only. top-scoring hits were mapped upstream of the putative PLP2 domain. these hits included CysTrp and CysTyr dipeptides. they either matched or closely resembled the CysTrp dipeptide. the 15 top hits were ranked in descending order of probability. the top two secondary structures were derived from PDB entries. the top two secondary structures were predicted by Jpred4 (74) the conservation profile, calculated based on the MSA of sequences from non-WPDV clusters, is shown for each domain of nsp1 and the N-terminal domains of nsp2. area above and below the mean conservation lines are shaded in black and gray, respectively. the structures shown are tertiary structures of PRRSV-2 PLP1a (A) and PLP1b (B) with residues conserved in all non-WPDV arteriviral PLP1a and PLP1b/PLP1c domains, respectively. conserved residues are shown in yellow (catalytic dyad) and red (all the rest) the size of this domain varied >5-fold, from 125 aa (EAV) to 716 aa (PRRSV-2) the presence of tandem repeats was initially detected in the WPDV HVR when it was compared to itself by using HHalign. similar results were obtained using MEME (50), which identified extended versions of this motif (E value = 9.3e9) in representatives of eight species. PxPxPR motifs were found predominantly in the HVR and much less frequently in the hinge domain. the only exception was two isolates of guenon virus 1 (KRTGV) that contain one copy of the motif in the PLP1a domain. the only exception being two isolates of kRTGV that contain one copy of the motif in the PLP1a domain. one motif is present in the PLP1a domain of 2 out of 4 isolates. one or two motifs are present in the hinge domain of 11 or 4 out of 15 isolates. EAV may be the only arterivirus with no PRF motifs in the nsp2 region. nsp2N and nsp2TF were produced during nsp2 PRF in arteriviruses. it was previously suggested that complete codon-anticodon repairing is required at the closely monitored ribosomal A site. mismatches are tolerated at the P site (33) columns containing amino acids whose tRNAs are present in the ribosomal P and A sites prior to frameshifting are highlighted with orange triangles. for each sequence, the genome coordinate of the first nucleotide in the alignment is specified. 4 220 13 uG_GUc_UcU 3 0 4 21 3 15 1 13 1 PBJV 3 Gu_GUU_UUU 3 CCCANCUCC 3 73 3 225 3 SHFV 1 GG_GUU_UUU 1 CCCANCUCC 1 77 1 225 1 KRTGV 4 Gu_GUU_UU 2 55 2 DeMAV 1 Gu_GUU_UU 1 CCCANCUCC 1 73 1 225 nsp2 PRF-related motifs of arteriviruses and the WPDV nsp2 nucleotide sequence were found in close proximity and canonical order. the hit to the slippery sequence profile was the only one observed that allowed complete A-site duplex repairing in the 2 frame. WPDV deviates considerably from arteriviruses in this region, in both PLP1b and PLP1c. this may be due to either coevolution with the PRF motifs or lack of involvement of these domains in PRF regulation. three bands of different sizes (0.4 kbp, 1.5 kbp, and 2.5 kbp) were obtained by primary PCR with the RACE.outer/WPD.S5.R primer pair (RACE 1). each band was reamplified separately with the RACE.inner primer in combination with either the WPD.S5.R, WPD.S7.R or WPD.S8.R primer. RNA containing 5\u2032 phosphates and reverse transcription of the ligated mRNA to cDNA by using random decamers. sequences captured on streptavidin-coated magnetic beads were used in the PCR step of the 5\u2032 RLM RACE protocol. the unknown 5\u2032 end was amplified with a selection of virus-specific reverse primers and adapter-specific RACE primers. the length of the WPDV genome is 12,901 nt, excluding the poly(A) tail, and the length of predicted polyprotein 1ab (pp1ab) of WPDV is 3,402 aa, whose coding sequence is flanked by a 245-nt 5\u2032 untranslated region (5\u2032-UTR) and a 97-nt 3\u2032-UTR (Table 1). ORF7 12,424 12,804 381 a Polyprotein 1ab is predicted to be expressed from ORF1a and -b via a 1 ribosomal frameshift. the total size of the analyzed MSA was 2,055 columns. the viruses represented all species defined by DEmARC (Table 2). phylogeny is presented by a posterior sample of phylogenetic trees. the trees are colored blue, red, or green, in descending order of prevalent topology. the genome organization, polyprotein processing scheme, and polyprotein domains used for phylogeny reconstruction are detailed in the bottom left corner for PRRSV-2. delineated species were further grouped into five clusters. nsp1-nsp2 genomic region of arteriviruses analyzed. all poorly characterized viruses of the simian clade adopted the domain organization described for SHFV. nsp1-nsp2 region for both the simian and LDV-PRRSV clades and three other single-species clades were converted into respective HMM profiles. the most informative comparisons were profile comparisons of the most diverse simian clade with itself and other clades. four Zn-binding residues were conserved in the ZnF MSA of non-WPDV arteriviruses. the residues implicated in the nuclease activity of PPRSV-2 (42) were found to be among the least conserved residues in the MSA of the nuclease domain. the \u201cnuclease\u201d domain included only two residues (Trp and Pro) that were invariant in arteriviruses. MSAs were visualized with the help of Espript 2.1 (82). Secondary structures were derived from PDB entries. relationships between paralogous and orthologous PLPs of all non-WPDV arteriviruses. similarity was limited to the N-terminal half of the domain. MSA of combined PLP1b/PLP1c was used to infer the Bayesian phylogeny of these domains. for each clade, considerable uncertainty of the branching was observed for most viruses. the top-scoring hit is drawn with a transparent line. the probability and E value of the top-scoring hit are given. for other designations, see the legend to Fig. 3A. aa 121 to 125 and 301 to 311 of the WPDV polyprotein. these top-scoring hits were mapped upstream of the putative PLP2 domain. these top-scoring hits included CysTrp and CysTyr dipeptides. catalytic cysteine is expected to be proteolytically silent. however, it did include the most characteristic HXXXXXF motif. no ZnF or nuclease domains were evident in WPDV. the 15 top hits were ranked in descending order of probability. catalytic motifs of nsp1 PLPs are underlined in cyan. the MSAs were visualized with Espript 2.1 (82). the homologous WPDV sequence specified below each logo. the similarity between PLP1a and PLP1b is below the Z-score cutoff. we mapped residues conserved in PLP1a and PLP1b/c of non-WPDV arteriviruses. the structures shown are tertiary structures of PRRSV-2 PLP1a and PLP1b/c. PRRSV-2 (accession number EU624117.1) nsp1a: left subdomain, Gly45, Cys76, and Gly109; and right subdomain, Pro134, Tyr141, Tyr141, His146, Phe152, Ala155, and Pro175. the figure was prepared with PyMOL (85). a subsequent search for strict matches to the PxPxPR motif in the pp1ab proteins of all sequenced arteriviruses identified at least one copy of the motif in the HVR for most viruses of 10 arterivirus species. two of the remaining four species, SHEV and KRCV-1, were found to contain a PxPxPR motif(s) in the hinge domain. the first column shows probability values assigned to hits containing PxPxPR motifs by HHalign. the second column shows matches (+) and mismatches of the PxPxPR pattern. the third column shows matches (+) and mismatches of the PxPxPR pattern. amino acid conservation identified by MEME corresponds to nucleotide PRF motif conservation, slippery sequence RG_GUU_UUU (R = G or A) and downstream element CCCANCUCC (33). these motifs were shown to guide translation of the genome region encoding HVR/TM1-CR junction in two alternative open reading frames, 1 and 2 PRF with the production of nsp2N and nsp2TF. columns containing amino acids whose tRNAs are expected to be present in the ribosomal P and A sites prior to frameshifting are marked with orange triangles. the first column of the TM1-CR domains is marked with a black box. columns containing the first nucleotides of 1TF and 2TF are highlighted with pink and blue bars.

HHalign comparisons were performed with the following parameters: SMIN score threshold of 5, local alignment mode, and realignment by the MAC algorithm not applied. a multistep procedure was used to characterize sequence repeats and associated motifs. the protein sequence of a virus was compared to itself by using HHalign. iviruses was reconstructed using a concatenated MSA of most conserved nsp domains. ProtTest 3.4 (78) favored the LG+I+G4+F model. a relaxed clock with an uncorrelated lognormal rate distribution was favored. MCMC chains were run for 5 million steps and sampled every 500 steps. the first 10% were discarded as burn-in. we used the DALI server (48) for comparison of tertiary structures. the steps included treatment of total RNA with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (CIP) to remove free 5\u2032 phosphates from all noncapped nucleic acids. the steps included treatment with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase (TAP) to remove the cap structure from full-length mRNA. the cDNA was enriched for the target sequence before proceeding with the PCR step. the mixture was incubated for 3 h at 43\u00b0C with gentle shaking. the viral sequences captured on streptavidin-coated magnetic beads were then washed 3 times in 1 wash buffer and resuspended in 8 l of water. the final round of 5\u2032 RLM RACE reactions (RACE 3) was performed using virus-specific primers (WPD.S10.R, WPD.S13.R, WPD.S14.R, and WPD.S15.R (RACE 2). the final round of 5\u2032 RLM RACE reactions (RACE 3) was performed using either HOT FIREPol PCR mix or Kappa LongRange hotstart ReadyMix. full-length genomes of arteriviruses available on 11 June 2015 were retrieved from GenBank (62) and RefSeq (63) using the homology-annotation hybrid retrieval of genetic sequences (HAYGENS) tool. sequence of the WPDV genome, including the newly sequenced 5\u2032 terminus, was added to the set. all presented protein MSAs were deposited at https://github.com/aag1/Arteriviridae_nsp1-2 in FASTA format. to quantify residue conservation at each position of the MSA, we used the R package Bio3D 1.1.-5 (70), the \u201cconserv\u201d command, the \u201csimilarity\u201d conservation assessment method. HHalign enables the user control over the SMIN score threshold, otherwise hard coded to be 20. the user can increase the number of alternative hits reported, which may be informative for analyzing extremely remote relationships. the phylogeny of arteriviruses was reconstructed using a concatenated MSA of most conserved nsp domains (Table S2). to select a model of evolution that best fits the data, ProtTest 3.4 (78) was used. in beAUti 1.8.2, ProtTest favored the LG+I+G4+F model. a relaxed clock with an uncorrelated lognormal rate distribution was favored over a strict clock. MCMC chains were run for 5 million steps and sampled every 500 steps. _index.html (1.2KB, html)."}
