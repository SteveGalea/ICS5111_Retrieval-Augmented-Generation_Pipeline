{"summary": "in all retroviruses except spumaviruses (15), pol is expressed initially as a Gag-Pol fusion from which the enzymes are subsequently cleaved by the virus-encoded protease. translation of the gag-Pol polyprotein is achieved through one of two translational mechanisms. retroviruses with a reduction in frameshifting of about 65% have decreased infectivity compared to the wild type (46). the effect on virus replication of modulating frameshifting efficiency has also been studied in the double-stranded RNA virus L-A of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (10) and in the coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome. a range of mutations stimulate or reduce frameshift efficiency in the alpharetrovirus Rous sarcoma virus. the overlap between gag and pol is very short, comprising just 7 nucleotides. this makes the introduction of synonymous mutations more straightforward than in a virus with a longer overlap such as HIV-1. pLADI (4), containing a highly infectious avian leukosis virus (ALV) subgroup A strain (from ATCC); pATV8 (29), containing the RSV Prague C (PrC) strain (from ATCC); pRCAS (22), containing the RSV Schmidt-Ruppin subgroup proviral genome lacking v-src. the pol gene replaced by that of the RSV Bryan high-titer. plasmids derived from pKT1+ (47) were cloned into a unique ClaI site and positionally replacing v-src. the vector contains the influenza A/PR8/34 PB1 gene under the control of bacteriophage T7 and SP6 promoters. pRCAS-AP was inserted to generate the pRCAS-AP series. it was not convenient to insert the SacII/HpaI fragments directly into pRCAS-AP. mRNAs were recovered by a single extraction with phenol-chloroform (1:1, vol/vol) dried gels were exposed to a Cyclone Plus Storage Phosphor Screen. the screen was scanned using a Typhoon TRIO Variable Mode Imager. DF1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modification of Eagle's medium. monolayers were prepared in 6-cm dishes and transfected in duplicate with pRCAS, pRCAS-AP, or mutant derivative, using FuGENE6. one set of dishes were harvested at 12 h posttransfection and the cell lysates subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting for viral proteins. the pellet was gently resuspended in 5 l of 10 mM Tris (pH 7.5) and incubated for 2 h at 37\u00b0C with 20 l Vogt RT assay buffer. the paper was washed in 0.3 M NaCl\u201330 mM trisodium citrate (4 5 min) and in 100% ethanol (2 1 min) cells were washed with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (50 l/well) for 20 min at room temperature. cells were permeabilized by incubation in a solution of 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS (50 l/well) after two more washes, nonspecific antibody binding sites were blocked by incubation in 100 l IF blocking buffer (1 PBS containing 1% [vol/vol] newborn calf serum) a solution of 5% powdered milk (Marvel) in 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 1.5 mM KH2PO4 (pH 6.7), and 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) the filter was incubated with -p27 diluted 1:1,000 in Marvel-PBST for 1 h at room temperature, followed by 5 5-min washes in PBST. four plasmids harboring infectious proviral clones were used in this work. pLADI (4), containing a highly infectious avian leukosis virus (ALV) subgroup A strain. pATV8, pRCAS, pRCAS, pRCAS and pRCAS. plasmids pMV-ALV, pMV-RSV, and pMV-RCAS were cloned back into the pRCAS infectious clone to generate the pRCAS series of mutants. some plasmids of the pRCAS series were digested with ClaI and the human placental alkaline phosphatase gene inserted to generate the pRCAS-AP series. reporter plasmids were linearized with AflII. mRNAs were recovered by single extraction with phenol-chloroform (1:1, vol/vol) followed by ethanol precipitation. mRNAs were resuspended in water, checked for integrity by agarose gel electrophoresis. DF1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modification of Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) fetal calf serum (DMEM-FCS) cells were seeded in dishes of a 24-well plate and grown for 18 to 24 h. cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pelleted, lysed in cell lysis buffer. cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pelleted, lysed in cell lysis buffer. virus was pelleted from 1 ml medium at 154,000 g for 1 h. the paper was washed in 0.3 M NaCl\u201330 mM trisodium citrate (4 5 min) and in 100% ethanol (2 1 min) and allowed to dry completely before exposure to X-ray film. DF1 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 4 103 cells/well in a final volume of 100 l/well. cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in 50 l/well of a 1:10,000 dilution of secondary antibody (rabbit anti-RSV p27 hyperimmune serum, -p27; Life Sciences Inc.) cells were washed in PBS and visualized under a magnification of 10, using an Olympus IX70 fluorescence microscope. bands were quantified using an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Licor) for horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies, bands were detected by chemiluminescence using ECL Plus Western blotting detection reagents. cell monolayers were washed twice in 1 PBS and fixed with 0.5% glutaraldehyde in 1 PBS for 15 min at room temperature. the four proviral clones have close sequence similarity in the frameshift region (Fig. 1 and 2). to investigate the role of frameshifting in RSV replication, we mutated the signal of the RCAS strain to reduce or stimulate frameshifting. the mutations be silent with respect to amino acid sequence. mutations were predicted to destabilize stem 2 (RCAS-S2) and stem 3 (RCAS-S3) independently. we postulated that the extended stem would prove to be a more substantial barrier to elongating ribosomes and would lead to increased frameshifting efficiencies. a restriction of this approach was that we were unable to achieve this with synonymous mutations. frameshift region was subcloned into the in vitro frameshift assay plasmid pMV1 to generate pMV-RCAS. in vitro transcripts generated using SP6 RNA polymerase were predicted to produce a 40-kDa nonframeshifted product and a 54-kDa 1-frameshifted product. destabilization of the pseudoknot stems reduced frameshifting dramatically for stem 1 (pMV-RCAS-9; 0.2%). pMV-RCAS-S3 (1.1%) was unexpected but may reflect a difference in folding of the major loop region in Prague C and RCAS. we also cloned into pMV1 the frameshifting signals of the PrC and ALV strains (to generate pMV-ALV and pMV-PrC) and a version of ALV in which U2502 (conserved in RCAS) was changed to C (to mimic the situation in PrC) the stop codon of the gag ORF is in red. the wild-type stem 1 is outlined in gray. the mutated nucleotides are shown in the same colors as in panel A. efficiencies measured in RRL for pMV-RCAS and mutant derivatives at 30\u00b0C or 39\u00b0Ca Construct Assay details Frameshift efficiency (%) RCAS (WT) Wild-type RCAS frameshift signal present 4.0 9 Destabilized PK through modification of PK1 0.2 11 Destabilized PK through modification of PK2 1.6 12 Inserted stop codon in pol frame (Gag only) 0.0 22 Modulation of stem 1 (3-bp extension) 7. pRCAS-AP vector was chosen initially because it contains a heat-stable alkaline phosphatase (AP) gene in place of the v-src oncogene, allowing direct visualization of virus spread by staining for the expressed enzyme. monolayers of DF1 cells were transfected in triplicate and even transfection efficiency was confirmed. in transfected cells, some Gag expression was evident, but little or no virus was released into the medium. analysis of the \u201cup\u201d mutants failed to identify an upper boundary to frameshifting efficiency. however, analysis of the \u201cup\u201d mutants failed to identify an upper boundary to frameshifting efficiency, as all of the clones appeared to be viable. cell lysates (upper panels) and supernatant virus (lower panels) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (8% and 15% gels, respectively) and Western blotting using a polyclonal anti-CA (p27) serum. cells and virus were processed and analyzed as described for panel A. the failure of pRCAS-AP-25-IBV to replicate could be attributed to the heightened frameshifting efficiency. pRCAS-AP-12-IBV-transfected cell culture medium had very little RT activity. the slippery sequence contains the codons for the two C-terminal residues of the cleaved enzyme. pMV-RCAS-derived mRNAs were prepared, translated, and analyzed. mRNAs were prepared, translated, and analyzed as described for Fig. 2. in the first virus, the RSV slippery sequence was modified by an A-to-U point mutation such that it resembles that of the simian retrovirus 1 pro/pol slippery sequence (AAAUUUUU; pRCAS-SRV) this mutation changes only the terminal leucine to phenylalanine, and as this maintains the hydrophobic nature of the C-terminal residue, we expected no impairment to protease function. mutations peaked at 18.2% (25-IBV2) and 17.4% (25-SRV) in all cases, either alone or in combination with the RCAS-12 and RCAS-25 mutations. the pattern of frameshifting at 39\u00b0C was similar, although frameshifting efficiency was somewhat reduced for some mRNAs. analysis of cell-associated and supernatant virus from all three rounds of infection was carried out by Western blotting and RT assays. the two Western blots in Fig. 6 are from passages of virus at the highest (Fig. 6A) and lowest (Fig. 6B) concentrations. we therefore expected that any effect of the various mutations on viability would be most evident in Fig. 6B. pRCAS-IBV2 and -SRV were not attenuated in cell culture. this indicates that a 1.5- to 2-fold stimulation in frameshifting efficiency is not detrimental to RSV replication. it also demonstrates that the amino acid changes at the C terminus of the viral protease are tolerated, as we had predicted. mutant derivatives, and released virus, were used to infect new cells. three days later, the procedure was repeated, generating four dishes in round 2. cell lysates (upper panel) and supernatant virus (lower panel) from the eight dishes were analyzed.

DF1 cells were infected with pRCASwt, pRCASIBV2 or pRCAS25IBV2, or pRCAS25IBV2, supernatant virus was harvested by centrifugation. serial dilutions were subjected to Western blotting with the anti-p27 antibody and to RT activity assays. p27 and RT levels were calculated for neat virus and three dilutions. the lower region of stem 1 of the pseudoknot was required for frameshifting and replication in vivo. mutations in pMV-RCAS are shown, with pseudoknot mutations color coded as described for Fig. 2A. four plasmids harboring infectious proviral clones were used in this work. pLADI (4) containing a highly infectious avian leukosis virus subgroup A strain; pATV8 (29), pRCAS (22), pRCAS (22), pRCAS (22), pRCAS (22), and RCAS-AP, a variant of pRCAS with a heat-stable human placental alkaline phosphat a mutation that destabilized stem 2 and another in which both stems 2 and 3 were deleted led to a stimulation of frameshifting of about 1.5-fold in vitro. a series of point mutations were introduced in the loop regions at the top of stem 1 such that the length of stem 1 would be extended by three (RCAS-22) or four (RCAS-25) base pairs. a 924-bp fragment encompassing the RCAS frameshift region was subcloned into the in vitro frameshift assay plasmid pMV1 (see Materials and Methods) to generate pMV-RCAS. in vitro transcripts generated using SP6 RNA polymerase were predicted to produce a 40-kDa nonframeshifted product and a 54-kDa 1-frameshifted product. frameshifting increased to 6.0%, 7.6%, and 9.4%, respectively. no effect was seen with pMV-RCAS-S2 and frameshifting was reduced with pMV-RCAS-S3 (1.1%). this may reflect a difference in folding of the major loop region in Prague C. the valine codon (GUU) mutated in RCAS-22, -23, and -25 is boxed. the wild-type slippery sequence is underlined. the PK2 and PK4 regions, which form stem 2* of the pseudoknot, are in bold. the stop codon of the gag ORF is in red. the 40-kDa nonframeshift (stop) and 54-kDa 1 frameshift products (FS) are indicated. the frameshifting efficiency measured for each signal is indicated below the relevant lanes. the frameshifting efficiency measured for each signal is indicated below the relevant lanes. IBV2 AAC inserted immediately downstream of natural SS to generate IBV SS 6.5 (6.1) 12-IBV2 AAC inserted immediately downstream of natural SS to generate IBV SS. pRCAS-AP vector was chosen initially because it contains a heat-stable alkaline phosphatase (AP) gene in place of the v-src oncogene. culture medium was harvested and sterile filtered, and aliquots were analyzed by Western blotting. in transfected cells, some Gag expression was evident, but little or no virus was released into the medium. in transfected cells, there was no evidence for replication of these mutants. pRCAS-AP-S3 was clearly attenuated, consistent with the measured frameshifting efficiencies. DF1 cells were transfected with pRCAS-WT or mutant derivatives (Transfection), and the released virus was used subsequently to infect new cells (Infection) pMV-RCAS-25-IBV engenders 15% frameshifting (a 4-fold stimulation over pRCAS-WT) and pMV-RCAS-12-IBV effecting 4.2% frameshifting. the failure of pRCAS-AP-25-IBV to replicate could be ascribed to the heightened frameshifting efficiency. cell lysates (upper panels) and supernatant virus (lower panels) were analyzed using a polyclonal anti-CA serum. bacterial particles were harvested from 1 ml culture medium by ultracentrifugation. reverse transcriptase activities were assayed. mRNAs were prepared, translated, and analyzed as described for Fig. 2. alternative strategy of slippery sequence modulation was implemented. substitution of this sequence at the RSV slip site has been shown to generate a 2-fold increase in frameshifting. MV-RCAS-12 and pMV-RCAS-25 were assayed for frameshifting in DF1 cell culture. at 30\u00b0C, we found that the SRV and IBV2 mutations had a stimulatory effect on frameshifting in all cases, either alone or in combination with the RCAS-12 and RCAS-25 mutations. the pattern of frameshifting at 39\u00b0C was similar, although frameshifting efficiency was somewhat reduced for some mRNAs. analysis of cell-associated and supernatant virus from all three rounds of infection was carried out by Western blotting and RT assays. only two viruses, pRCAS-SRV1 and pRCAS-IBV2, replicated as well as the wild-type virus, and these viruses retained wild-type levels of RT activity. the pRCAS-12-SRV clone was nonreplicating in the infectivity assay. it had a TCID50 titer some 2 to 3 log lower than the wild-type virus. pRCAS-12-IBV2 and -SRV were not attenuated in cell culture. this indicates that a 1.5- to 2-fold stimulation in frameshifting efficiency is not detrimental to RSV replication. DF1 cells were transfected with pRCAS-WT or mutant derivatives. released virus was used subsequently to infect new cells. three successive rounds of infection were carried out. pRCAS and mutant derivativesa were harvested from 1 ml culture medium by ultracentrifugation. incorporation of [-32P]dTTP was visualized by autoradiography. f, frameshifting; ND, not determined. comparisons of replication capacity and frameshift efficiency are based on frameshift values measured in vitro. but from these data, we could not account for reduced replication of pRCAS-12-SRV, since this mutant showed activity in RRL at 39\u00b0C close to that of the wild-type signal. pRCAS-25-IBV2 replicated less well than pRCAS-25, pRCAS-IBV2 and pRCAS-SRV. in infectivity assays, pRCAS-25-IBV2 replicated less well than pRCAS-25, pRCAS-IBV2 and pRCAS-SRV. virions from pRCASwt, pRCASIBV2 and pRCAS25IBV2 infected cells contained 1.37- and 3.66-fold more RT. the RT/p27 ratio was calculated for each virus and is shown normalized to the ratio for pRCASwt. virions from pRCASwt and pRCAS25IBV2 were infected with pRCASwt. mutations reduced frameshifting 2 to 3-fold in RRL and blocked virus replication. in the double mutant constructs, frameshifting was at a level close to that of the wild type. the amino acid substitutions present in RCAS-13 and RCAS-14 are clearly tolerated by the virus. cell lysates (upper panel) and supernatant virus (lower panel) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using a polyclonal anti-CA (p27) serum. a 3-fold reduction in frameshifting generated a severe replication defect and an 8-fold reduction abolished replication. transfection of plasmids expressing Gag and Gag-Pol had little effect on virus replication, although higher levels of Gag-Pol were detrimental (44). phenotypic effect of increased Gag-Pol/Gag ratios was attributed to reduced formation of stable virion RNA dimers. ucine zipper-like motif of hydrophobic repeats favorable for formation of a coiled coil. but such a coiled coil was not found in active protease dimers. this could be a mechanism used by RSV to prevent intracellular activation of the high levels of viral protease. the formation of stem 3 (but not stem 2) within the main loop is important for frameshifting in vitro and virus viability in infected cells. previous studies of the Prague C strain of RSV indicated that neither stem 2 nor stem 3 was important for frameshifting and that their destabilization (stem 2) or deletion (both stem 2 and stem 3) actually leads to a 50% stimulation of 1 frameshifting in vitro. this effect was unexpected, as the frameshift regions of RCAS, Prague C, and despite this complexity, it is clear that the formation of the pseudoknot is not absolutely required for virus viability if frameshifting is enhanced. it has long been proposed that frameshifting could be exploited as a target for antiviral intervention."}
