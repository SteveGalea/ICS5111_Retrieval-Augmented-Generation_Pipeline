{"summary": "influenza B virus was detected using a respiratory virus panel of assays. the complete influenza B hemagglutinin gene was amplified and sequenced directly from clinical specimens. 71 hospitalized pediatric patients were influenza B positive. influenza B viruses evolve mainly through genetic reassortment between strains of different lineages. this allows for escape from host immunity and preservation of the ability to cause disease. despite the lineage, influenza B infection can cause severe disease and death. the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Fondazione IRCCS Ca\u2019 Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy. the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Fondazione IRCCS Ca\u2019 Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy, and written informed consent was obtained from the enrolled subjects. a panel of laboratory-developed real-time RT-polymerase chain reactions (PCR) or real-time PCRs was used to detect and quantify the following viruses. influenza virus A and B (including subtype determination), human rhinovirus (hRV), human parainfluenza virus (hPIV) 3, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) types A and B, human coronavirus (hCoV)-OC43, -229E, -NL63, and Purified PCR products were sequenced using the BigDye Terminator Cycle-Sequencing kit. nucleotide alignments were constructed using the Kimura 3-parameter. a bootstrap analysis with 1,000 replicates was performed. the IFEL method is similar to FEL, but tests for site-by-site selection only along internal branches of the phylogeny. sites with SLAC, FEL, IFEL and MEME p-values of 0.1 and a FUBAR posterior probability of >0.90 were accepted as candidates. study approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Fondazione IRCCS Ca\u2019 Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy. written informed consent was obtained from the enrolled subjects. children 8 years were required to give their written assent before entering the study. -r+1730 5\u2019-gacagatggagcawgaaacrttgtctctgg-3\u2019 with the following cycling conditions: 95\u00b0C for 30 min, 95\u00b0C for 10 min. 50 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 30 s, 58\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 2 min. final extension cycle at 72\u00b0C for 5 min. tests for positive selection were conducted using single-likelihood ancestor counting (SLAC), fixed-effects likelihood (FEL), random-effects likelihood (REL), internal branch fixed-effects likelihood (IFEL), the mixed-effects model of evolution (MEME), and fast unconstrained Bayesian approximation (FUBAR) Phylogenetic analyses A total of 55/71 (78.9%) influenza B strains were sequenced. from 49/55 (90.1%), nearly complete HA gene sequencing was performed. only a partial HA sequence, ranging from 597 nt to 1006 nt, was available. bootstrap consensus tree inferred from 1000 replicates is taken to represent the evolutionary history of the analyzed taxa. the percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) is shown next to the branches. HA1 120-loop (116\u2013137) I117V (42), V124A (1), D129N (44) 150-loop (141\u2013150) I146V (3) 160-loop (162\u2013167) - 190-loop (194\u2013202) D197N (46), T199A (1), A202T (1) A global analysis of selective pressure made using the SLAC model indicated an estimated overall dN/dS ratio of 0.175. 380, 462, 531, 563, 565 REL 11, 58, 117, 197, 526 73, 80, 244, 256, 265, 351, 358, 380, 531, 563 FUBAR 11 73, 78, 80, 122, 244, 256,265, 297, 351, 358, 380, 462, 531, 563, 565. none of the enrolled children had received the seasonal influenza vaccine prepared for the 2001 the overall nucleotide identity of analyzed HA sequences with the reference influenza B vaccine strain (B/Brisbane/60/2008) ranged between 98.5% and 99.8%. the great majority of influenza B strains (47/55, 85.5%) fall in a clade defined by amino acid substitutions I117V, N129D and V146I. ylation site in the sequence of B/Brisbane/60/2008 as well as in other influenza B strains is boxed in red. only 2 amino acid changes were observed in HA regions involved in receptor binding or in antibody recognition. no sites were identified as being under positive selection by site-specific analyses in the influenza B alignment. the IFEL model used to determine the selection pressure acting on the codons along the internal branches of the tree identified a positively selected codon in the influenza B sequences. the prevalence of influenza among children aged 5\u201314 years in Italy was calculated to be 17.8% [16], a value quite similar to the found in this study. antigenic characterization of influenza B strains is important in the assessment of the similarity between reference viruses and circulating viruses. in the whole Italy prevalence of B influenza virus was 57% [18], a value not substantially different from that found in this study. the use of a quadrivalent vaccine containing two influenza B strains could reduce the mismatch between vaccine and circulating influenza strains. in four influenza B strains, a loss of an important glycosylation site was observed. in an experimental egg-adapted influenza B variant, the absence of glycans at residue 194\u2013196 (HA1) was observed. this finding suggests a possible impact of this loss in the antibody recognition after vaccination. influenza B viruses circulated in the Lombardy Region of Italy during the influenza season 2015\u20132016 belonged to the influenza B Victoria-lineage not included in the trivalent vaccine commonly administered during the 2015\u20132016 influenza season in Italy. the great majority of influenza B strains were similar to those circulating in the same period."}
