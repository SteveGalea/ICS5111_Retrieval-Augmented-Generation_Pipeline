{"summary": "sequence analysis of SARS-coronavirus isolates revealed specific genotypes predominated at different periods of the epidemic. this information can be used as a footprint for tracing the epidemiology of infections and monitor viral evolution. but direct sequencing analysis of a large number of clinical samples is cumbersome and time consuming. characterization of the viral sequences has been shown to be a useful tool for confirming epidemiological associations between infected individuals as suspected from conventional epidemiological investigations. a 5-nucleotide motif at the GZ02 reference nucleotide residues 17,564, 21,721, 22,222, 23,823, and 27,827 was identified to be most useful for distinguishing the major viral genotypes. RNA was extracted from viral isolates cultured from SARS patients' clinical specimens using the QIAamp viral RNA mini kit. RNA was reverse transcribed with random hexamer according to manufacturer's instructions. the thermal profile consists of an initial incubation at 50\u00b0C for 2 min. then a denaturation period at 95\u00b0C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 92\u00b0C for 15 s. the genotypes were scored with the SDS2.1 software.

DNA of each amplicon was sequenced by the dideoxy terminator method on an automated DNA sequencer based on capillary electrophoresis. CUHK-W1, CUHK-Su10, no template control. allelic discrimination assays were used to genotype SARS-CoV in clinical samples. allelic discrimination plot of 30 SARS patients using the allelic discrimination assay on SNV 27827. synthetic template for FAM-labeled allele, synthetic template for VIC-labeled allele, patients with SARS-CoV showing no allelic signal at SNV 27827. the deletion variant was first isolated from a discrete cohort of 15 epidemiologically related SARS patients. patients had fever onset between April 4 to 15, 2003 which predated the disease onset dates of all cases in the original patient cohort. all but one patient presented to hospital A initially for other medical conditions without fever or evidence of chest infection. the remaining patient was a resident at estate T and presented to hospital A with symptoms and signs of chest infection on April 8, 2003. we were able to trace the emergence of this deletion variant to early April 2003. the approach provides a rapid and simple means to accurate genotype screening. the assay is simple, easy to perform and reproducible. it can therefore be used as an efficient means to screen for virus genotypes."}
