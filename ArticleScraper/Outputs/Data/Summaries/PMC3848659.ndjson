{"summary": "non-severe acute respiratory syndrome (non-SARS)-related human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been detected in respiratory tract samples from children and adults. however, the natural prevalence of antibodies against these viruses in serum among population is unknown. a previously unknown coronavirus caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003. in 2003, a previously unknown coronavirus caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in humans. in 2003, a previously unknown coronavirus caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in humans. the prevalence of anti-S antibodies specific for non-SARS HCoV infection among children and adults is unknown. we expressed S proteins in a eukaryotic system and established an IFA for the detection of IgG or IgM antibodies against these four viruses. artificially synthesised S fragments of HCoV-OC43, -229E, -HKU1 and -NL63 were cloned into the eukaryotic expression plasmid pVRC. the plasmid pVRC-8304 (from Dr. Gary Nabel, NIH, USA) was used as the control. female BALB/c mice were anaesthetised and primed with pVRC-8303 plasmid. all mice were immunised at weeks 0, 3, and 6 and bled at week 8. gene delivery using in vivo electroporation was performed. the membrane was washed in PBS containing Tween 20 (0.1%) and incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Pierce, Rockford, IL) the proteins were visualised with SuperSignal Chemiluminescence Substrate (Pierce) anti-S-specific antibodies in sera were quantified using 1:100-diluted FITC-labelled sheep anti-human IgG (H + L; Zhongahan Co., Beijing, China) or 1:40-diluted FITC-labelled anti-human IgM (-chain-specific), and the slide was viewed under an inverted fluorescence microscope. non-transfected 293 T cells or those transfected with the control plasmid (pVRC8304, which express the leader sequence of the original gene was removed and replaced by a human TPA leader sequence (1\u201321 aa) at the N-terminal of the S fragment. artificially synthesised S fragments of HCoV-OC43, -229E, -HKU1 and -NL63 were cloned into the eukaryotic expression plasmid pVRC. the plasmid pVRC-8304 was used as the control. the control was transfected with pVRC-8303 plasmid and detected with mixed anti-S mouse serum of a non-SARS CoV. all mice were immunised at weeks 0, 3, and 6 and bled at week 8. gene delivery using in vivo electroporation was performed as described previously. the membrane was washed in PBS containing Tween 20 (0.1%) and incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody diluted to 1:50. the membrane was washed and the proteins were visualised with SuperSignal Chemiluminescence Substrate (Pierce) the anti-S-specific antibodies in sera (diluted to 1:20) were quantified using 1:100-diluted FITC-labelled sheep anti-human IgG (H + L; Zhongahan Co., Beijing, China) or 1:40-diluted FITC-labelled anti-human IgM (-chain-specific) slide was viewed under an inverted fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) % No. of subjects 794 (457/337) Mean age (y) 28.75 17.79 Age range (y) 0.5\u201375 Group Child (14 y) 215 (113/102) 1 y 8 (5/3) 1\u20133 y 134 (68/66) 3\u20136 y 46 (7/18) 7\u201314 y 27 (12/15) no false positive/negative result was observed in our study. prevalence of anti-S IgG according to age group A representative anti-S-positive IFA result is shown in Figure 2. the proportions of HCoV IgG-positive samples increased with age during infancy, reaching levels >75% at age >4 years. a significant drop in seropositivity rate was observed for HCoV-OC43 in the 15- to 30-year-old group and for HCoV-HKU1 in the 7- to 14-year-old group. the proportion of subjects with detectable IgG antibodies to HCoV-229E was significantly greater than that to -OC43 and -NL63. however, there were no significant differences in the anti-S IgG seropositivity rates of individual HCoVs with respect to gender in either the child or adult population. the anti-S IgM positivity rate of HCoV-HKU1 was significantly higher than that of the other three HCoVs among the 3-year-old groups. the positivity rate increased with age and began to drop after peaking in the school-age group (6 years), which is similar to that described above for anti-S IgG detection. expression of the HCoV S proteins was confirmed by western blotting. the segments were detected by anti-S mouse serum derived from DNA vaccination with individual HCoV expression plasmids. of 794 serum samples tested for anti-S IgG by IFA, only 29 were negative for anti-S IgG of HCoV. there were no significant differences between genders. the distribution and variation trend of anti-S IgG to the four HCoVs among the age groups is shown in Figure 3. in the adult population (14 years of age), the seroprevalence of anti-S IgG of HCoV-229E, -OC43, and -NL-63 did not differ significantly among the age groups. in the adult population (n = 576), the IgG positivity rate was 87.5% for 229E, 76.39% for OC43, 71.88% for HKU1 and 75.52% for NL63. the total positivity rate of anti-S IgM was 36.24% for 229E, 43.12% for OC43, 54.46% for HKU1 and 44.50% for NL63. there were no significant differences in the anti-S IgM seropositivity rates of individual HCoVs with respect to gender. there was a significant difference in the anti-S IgM positivity rate for individual HCoVs among age groups. four endemic non-SARS-related HCoVs (HCoV-OC43,-229E,-NL63 and \u2013HKU1) are major contributors to respiratory tract infections. but specific and feasible serological surveys of these HCoVs have to date been reported only rarely in China. the rS-based IgM ELISA is more sensitive than the rN-based IgM ELISA for SARS-CoV pneumonia [25]. our results showed that the S-based IFA enabled specific detection of IgG or IgM to four individual HCoVs. both anti-S IgG and IgM antibodies were found in the child group. serum IgG to HCoV-229E, -NL63, and -OC43 was detected in at least 98% of subjects. antibodies to -HKU1 were identified in 96 subjects (91%). 75% and 65% of serum samples were positive for antibodies to HCoV-NL63 and -229E. anti-S IgM to individual HCoVs was detected in a portion of the asymptomatic child population using IFA. a basis for the prevention and control of non-SARS-related HCoV infection. further research is needed to determine the false-positivity and -negativity rates associated with this anti-S IFA. authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
