{"summary": "restriction factors are cellular proteins that target specific stages of virus life cycles. these factors target virus features or replication mechanisms that are broadly conserved within virus orders or families. a multifactorial and sometimes redundant effect of multiple ISG-encoded restriction factors on a specific virus is thought to be a critical adaptation to the evolutionary pressure provided by rapidly mutating viruses. a list of known restriction factors active against human viruses and the specific virus life cycle stages at which they act are shown in Table 1. Known antiviral restriction factors and the specific virus life cycle stages that they act are discussed in detail in this review article. SF2 Entry [205] TRIM5a Uncoating [235], [236], [237], [238] TRIM22 Transcription [240] TRIM25 Replication [240] TRIM56 Replication [242] VIPERIN* Transcription [157] ZMPSTE4 Entry [55] The discovery of restriction factors has also provided us with a deeper understanding of why some cell types and some hosts are particularly susceptible to specific viruses. 3G was identified in 2002 as an antiviral protein active against HIV-1. it has also been shown to inhibit other retroviruses, as well as other retroviruses. a3G belongs to the APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases. HD, CCCH, and WWE domains are named for specific amino acid sequence elements. the exact mechanism of viral inhibition used by A3G was initially an area of contention in this field. IFITM3 is associated with inhibition of fusion at virus endosomes. but is shown here inhibiting fusion at the cell surface for graphical simplicity. APOBEC3G associates with viral genomic material. A3G deaminates residues on the negative sense single stranded HIV-1 reverse transcribed DNA. this deamination causes deoxycytidine to deoxyuridine mutations. this leads to guanine-to-adenosine transformations once the virus completes reverse transcription. induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) is a 133 amino acid protein. it associates with membranes via a transmembrane domain and a palmitoylated amphipathic helix. the first described and most extensively studied antiviral mechanism for IFITM3 is its ability to block virus entry. a role for cholesterol in inhibition of infections by IFITM3 has not been supported by subsequent studies. the aforementioned amphipathic helix within IFITM3 and its amphipathicity were shown to be required for antiviral activity. the presence of these IFITMs reduces virion infectivity, likely through a mechanism that alters membrane fusion dynamics. a unique function of IFITM3 in inhibiting the processing of the HIV-1 env protein has also been described [58], which may serve to limit virus-induced inflammatory pathologies in some instances. resistance of HIV-1 to IFITM3 inhibition has also been mapped to mutations in its fusion glycoprotein [63,66] resistance of HIV-1 to IFITM3 inhibition has also been mapped to mutations in its fusion glycoprotein. MxB localization to the nuclear envelope is governed by an N-terminal nuclear localization signal (NLS) [81], suggesting that MxB and MxA may employ overlapping antiviral mechanisms even though their cellular sites of action are different. the antiviral activity of Mx proteins depends on intricate 3-dimensional configurations. ribonucleoprotein complexes are surrounded by ring-like MxA multimers that interfere with subsequent steps of the influenza virus life cycle [87] conflicting evidence indicates that MxA acts at a step after primary transcription in which dimerization, but not higher-order oligomerization is required for antiviral activity of MxA against IAV [73]. SAMHD1 is ubiquitously expressed in all cell types, where it localizes in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. it exists as a monomer, dimer or tetramer, with oligomerization induced by binding of GTP and dGTP. this domain is also responsible for the nucleic acid binding ability of SAMHD1 [97] the mechanism by which SAMHD1 inhibits HIV-1 infection relies on its dNTPase activity. SAMHD1 depletes the dNTP pools, thus preventing HIV-1 reverse transcription, leading to abortive infection [103,104] depletion of dNTPs is thought to be the primary mechanism by which SAMHD1 restricts virus infections. addition of exogenous deoxynucleotides does not fully rescue HIV-1 infection in target cells, suggesting that SAMHD1 restriction may also occur through a dNTPase-independent mechanism. phenotype was reversed in mice with double KO of SAMHD1 and type I IFN receptor. these reports linked SAMHD1 to innate immunity and suggested that SAMHD1 functions as negative regulator of innate immune responses. HIV-1 does not use Vpx to degrade SAMHD1 but can establish productive infection in target cells. it has been speculated that less pathogenic HIV-1 may rely on SAMHD1-mediated immune suppression to dampen the triggering of antiviral innate immune responses. dimerization of tetherin molecules in relation to is activity has been a subject of debate in the field. it is widely believed that dimerization of tetherin is indispensable for its activity against HIV-1. however, it may not be required for the restriction of all viruses inhibited by tetherin. tetherin-deficient mice exhibit weaker natural killer cell, dendritic cell, and CD8+ T-cell responses to Friend retrovirus. tetherin-deficient mice exhibit weaker natural killer cell, dendritic cell, and CD8+ T-cell responses to Friend retrovirus. etherin was linked to a cytoplasm-facing endocytosis motif that is not involved in its tethering activity. in rare instances, tetherin has been shown to increase viral replication and dissemination. it has been hypothesized that interaction between tetherin and CMV at the cell surface facilitates viral entry. Viperin is a member of the radical Sadenosyl lmethionine superfamily of enzymes. it reduces SAM to a 5\u2032deoxyadenosyl radical intermediate via an iron-sulfur (Fe-S) binding motif. this binding motif is located within the central domain of the protein. the binding of the N-terminal amphipathic helix to the HCV NS5A protein is required for HCV restriction [166,172] a recent landmark study demonstrated that Viperin utilizes a SAM-dependent mechanism to terminate RNA replication catalyzed by RNA-dependent RNA polymerases of multiple flaviviruses. the relevance of this role in vivo is yet to be investigated. the exact role of the conserved C-terminal domain remains unknown. mutating Trp361 in the C-terminus abrogated the antiviral activity. cysteine-cysteine-cysteine-cysteine-histidine type zinc finger motifs at the N terminus are involved in hetero- or homodimerization of ZAP isoforms. despite their differences, ZAP-S and -L both restrict a wide range of viruses including alphaviruses, filoviruses, Hepatitis B virus, influenza A virus, and retroviruses. ZAP restricts retrotransposition of long interspaced Element-1 (LINE-1) by reducing the accumulation of LINE-1 RNA and its encoded proteins. LINE-1 is the only active retrotransposon in the human genome. the mechanism of action is multifaceted and involves distinct cellular pathways. ZAP selectively binds to CG enriched segments, suggesting that ZAP may be the evolutionary driver of viral mimicry of CG suppressed genomes. TRIM25, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, interacts with ZAP, is required for its activation and enhances its ability to inhibit the translational activity of Sindbis virus. siRNA knockdown experiments identified the influenza A virus NS1 protein as an antagonist of ZAP-S [192]. the factors reviewed here are among the dozens of cellular proteins that are reported to limit virus infections [1,2]. additional antiviral restriction factors likely remain to be discovered. restriction factors increase or decrease immune responses to virus infections. identifying deleterious polymorphisms may explain susceptibilities of individuals to severe infections. this knowledge may ultimately inform personalized medicine approaches, such as vaccine prioritization or other measures to prevent or monitor specific infections."}
