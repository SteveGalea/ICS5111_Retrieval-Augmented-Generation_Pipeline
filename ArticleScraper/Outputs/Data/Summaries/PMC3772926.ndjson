{"summary": "the IL-33/ST2 axis is crucially involved in diverse inflammatory and immune mediated pathologies. IL-33 is over-expressed in influenza virus lung infection in mice [5,6] and IL-33 produced by necrotic cells drives protective antiviral CD8+ T cell responses in lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection in mice [7] the polyinosine-polycytidylic acid (Poly(I:C) induces a moderate acute hepatic injury and mimics a model of viral hepatitis [18,19]. a pretreatment with D-galactosamine (D-GalN) in poly(I:C) injected-mice aggravated the acute hepatic injury which become lethal. NK cells decreased after transient increase in liver from pathogenic mice. we found increased expression of IL-33 in liver following poly(I:C) and L2-MHV3-induced fulminant hepatitis in mice. hepatocyte-specific IL-33 expression in poly(I:C) induced liver injury was partially dependent of NK cells but not of NKT cells. in vivo treatment protocol, mice were intravenously injected with 30 g/mouse of poly(I:C) (Invivogen) alone or with D-galactosamine (D-GalN) pretreatment at a dose of 15 mg/mouse (i.p) the control mice received a similar volume of vehicle in each treatment group. immunohistopathological, biochemical and immunohistochemical analyses. hematoxylin and eosin staining and levels of liver transaminase (ALT/AST) in serum were performed as described earlier [10]. animals wild-type (WT) mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories or from Janvier (Le Genest-sur-isle, France) the animals, certified as MHVs-free by the manufacturer, were housed under HEPA-filtered air. control mice received a similar volume of RPMI-1640 (Gibco Laboratories, Grand Island, NY) after 16, 24, 28, 39, 48 and 72 h of infection, the mice were anaesthetized by i.p injection using ketamine hydrochloride (200 mg/kg; Vetrepharm Canada Inc., Belleville, ON, Canada) and xylazine (10 mg/kg; Bayer Inc., Toronto, ON, Canada) and euthan the counting of IL-33 positive hepatocytes was carried in at least 20 different microscopic fields corresponding to 2.67 mm2 surface area. the protocol and conditions for RNA extraction, RT-PCR and qPCR were similar as reported earlier by our laboratory using specific primers for 18S, IL-33, IL-6, IL-1, IFN-, IFN, TNF and CXCL1. the pre-sensitization of mice with D-galactosamine (D-GalN) led to poly(I:C)-induced severe liver injury in mice with elevated serum AST/ALT levels at 8h. the mice treated with combination of D-GalN Poly(I:C) died earlier within 16h compared to D-GalN or Poly(I:C) alone treated mice. histology of liver tissues revealed increased hemorrhagic lesions in liver after D-GalN Poly(I:C) treatment. mRNA expression of IL-33 was significantly increased (2-3 fold) in poly(I:C) treated mice compared to control mice. IL-33 expression was downregulated in D-GalN Poly(I:C) treated mice. the transcript level of TNF-, IL-1, IL-1 and IL-6 was significantly up-regulated following acute hepatitis (8h) compared to D-GalN poly(I:C) induced acute hepatitis. mRNA expression of IFN- and CXCL1/KC was not varied between poly(I:C), D-GalN poly(I:C) or PBS treated mice. anti-ASGM1 pre-treatment effectively depleted NK cells in liver of mice compared to vehicle control or poly(I:C) treated mice. but NK cells depletion led to enhanced liver injury. mRNA expression of IL-33 was not varied between control (non NK depleted) and NK-depleted poly(I:C) or D-GalN Poly(I:C) treated mice at 8h of post injection. NK depletion led to decrease in number of IL-33 expressing hepatocytes in poly(I:C) treated mice compared to non NK depleted mice. pro-inflammatory cytokine expression of TNF-, IL-1 and IL-6 was up-regulated in poly(I:C) or D-GalN Poly(I:C) treated mice. NK cell depletion did not decrease expression level of the inflammatory cytokines. expression of TRAIL was significantly increased in both NK depleted and non depleted mice following poly(I:C) or D-GalN Poly(I:C) administration. liver histology revealed hemorrhagic lesions in liver after D-GalN poly(I:C) treatment in NKT KO mice without remarkable liver injury in Poly(I:C) or vehicle control NKT KO mice. hepatocyte-specific IL-33 expression was evident in Poly(I:C)-administered NKT KO mice but not in D-GalN Poly(I:C)-treated or control NKT KO mice. IL-33 was immunostaining in livers of CD1d KO mice treated with PBS, Poly(I:C) and/or D-GalN Poly(I:C) treatment at 8h of post injection. pathogenic strain of mouse hepatitis virus induces fulminant hepatitis in mice. mRNA expression of IFN-, nucleocapsid of MHV3 and IL-33 in livers of L2-MHV3 induced hepatitis. sections of mice liver following vehicle or L2-MHV3 infection (16, 24, 48 and 72h) were stained with H&E for histopathology. IL-33 expression is up-regulated in liver sinusoidal and vascular endothelial cells. MHV3 infection in mice up-regulated pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. mRNA expression of IL-1 was not greatly increased following hepatitis. mRNA expression of IL-33 was not significantly increased in poly(I:C) or poly(I:C) treated mice. mRNA expression of IL-33 in liver was not significantly increased in poly(I:C) or poly(I:C) alone treated mice. levels of serum AST/ALT (IU/L) and relative fold change in mRNA expression of IL-33 in WT mice treated with Poly(I:C) (30 g/mouse i.v.) sections of mice liver following PBS, D-GalN, Poly(I:C) and/or D-GalN Poly(I:C) were stained with H&E for histopathology. endothelial cells expressed IL-33 constitutively in PBS control mice livers. expression of IL-33 was found in hepatocytes of poly(I:C) treated mice. but not in D-GalN Poly(I:C) induced liver injury. alN, poly(I:C), D-GalN Poly(I:C) induced hepatitis mice. NK cells pre-depletion led to severe D-GalN Poly(I:C) induced acute liver injury, increased pro-inflammatory cytokines and down-regulated IL-33 expression. pre-depletion (48h before) of NK cells by anti-ASGM1 antibody in mice. confirmation of NK cells percentage by flow cytometry analysis. levels of serum AST/ALT (IU/L) and relative fold change. mRNA expression of IL-33 was not varied between control (non NK depleted) and NK-depleted Poly(I:C) or D-GalN Poly(I:C) treated mice. NK depletion led to decrease in number of IL-33 expressing hepatocytes in poly(I:C) treated mice compared to non NK depleted mice. the expression of CXCL1 only increased in NK depleted D-GalN poly(I:C) treated mice when compared to control mice (p 0.05) the role of NKT cells in poly(I:C)-induced liver injury is not well known but we have observed a partial decrease in NKT cells percentages in anti-ASGM1-treated mice. IL-33 expressing hepatocytes significantly increased in poly(I:C)-administered NKT KO mice but not in D-GalN Poly(I:C)-treated or control NKT KO mice. these results suggest that NKT cells have a protective effect on liver injury in association with increased expression of IL-33 in hepatocytes during poly(I:C)-induced liver injury. liver mRNA expressions of IFN- and nucleocapsid of MHV3 increased significantly at 16, 24, 48 and 72h of post infection with peak at 72h. liver mRNA expressions of IL-33 increased significantly at 16, 24, 48 and 72h of post infection with severe and peak liver injury at 72h (p 0.001) IL-33 expression is up-regulated in liver sinusoidal and vascular endothelial cells and hepatocytes during L2-MHV3-induced fulminant hepatitis. the pathogenic strain of mouse hepatitis virus was associated with increased expression of IL-33 in liver. 2-MHV3 induces fulminant hepatitis in mice [23] and mimics a model of fulminant viral hepatitis (HBV) in human. mRNA expressions of IFN- and nucleocapsid of MHV3 increased significantly at 16, 24, 48 and 72h of post infection with peak at 72h. fulminant hepatic tissues by using primary antibody goat IgG anti-mouse-IL-33 and secondary HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-goat antibody with hematoxylin counterstaining. IL-33 expression is up-regulated in liver sinusoidal and vascular endothelial cells and hepatocytes during L2-MHV3-induced fulminant hepatitis. inflammatory cytokines play an important role in development of fulminant hepatitis. we studied expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in liver after MHV3 infection. mRNA expression of IL-1 was not greatly increased following hepatitis. IL-33 and sST2 have shown to be up-regulated in acute on chronic and chronic hepatic failure [15] and in chronic HBV and HCV infections in human [14,16,17]. cellular sources of IL-33 in viral hepatitis are not well known. the cellular sources of IL-33 in viral hepatitis are not well known. innate immune stimulation by the TLR3 agonist alone can induce IL-33 expression in liver especially in hepatocytes. the regulation of IL-33 by TLR viral and bacterial ligands has been demonstrated in human corneal epithelial cells and fibroblasts. IL-33 was up-regulated by Poly(I:C) stimulation in murine macrophages and its transcriptional regulation was dependent on two transcription factors. the increased CXCL1 during MHV3 induced acute hepatitis may lead to chemotaxis/infiltration of neutrophils. the mechanism of MHV3-induced liver injury have shown to be dependent on activation of target cells of virus like Kupffer cells, NK cells, hepatocytes, sinusoidal endothelial and vascular endothelial cells. mRNA expression of IL-33 was over-expressed after L2-MHV the difference seemed to be related with kinetics and dose of D-GalN Poly(I:C) used in these studies. the significant increase in CXCL1 expression in NK-depleted mice may explain the interplay of immune cells migration in liver. the major sources of CXCL1 in liver are endothelial cells, Kupffer cells, hepatic stellate cells and neutrophils. KT cells in association with increased hepatocyte-specific IL-33 expression during fulminant hepatitis. IL-33 is rapidly up-regulated during poly(I:C) and MHV3-induced fulminant hepatitis."}
