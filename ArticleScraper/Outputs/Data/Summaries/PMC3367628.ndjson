{"summary": "we assume a second target host population (H2) enters the community and can become infected by the pathogen. the pathogen is well established in H1, we assume S1 and I1 are unchanged by H2. in the terminology of Haydon et al. (12), H1 may or may not be a maintenance host. the target host population H2 has 4 possible outcomes: 1) uninfected, 2) infected but unable to sustain the pathogen, 3) infected and able to sustain the pathogen, or 4) infected and driven to extinction by the pathogen. the first 2 thresholds are analogous to established density-based thresholds in epidemiology. the within-H2 transmission rate is too low to sustain the pathogen (f22 0) the between-species transmission from H1 is also low (f12 0). this represents the case in which the pathogen is specialized to the endemic host and there is either very low exposure to H2. rabies in side-striped jackals (H2) in africa is an apparent multihost pathogen. rabies is not self-sustaining because of the density of the low susceptible jackal population (S2), and epidemics are frequently seeded from the domestic dog reservoir (high 12) close-contact nature of the infection process prevented transmission of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) from primates to humans (6,24) severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2013associated coronavirus in humans. the primary transmission event is believed to be the result of close human contact with civet cats in China. case represents apparent multihost dynamics that differ from spillover dynamics in that the disease is nontransient in H2 but the pathogen is sustained because of frequent between-species transmission from the disease-endemic host. rabies in side-striped jackals (H2) in africa is an apparent multihost pathogen. the pathogen can persist in the target host (H2) but the net rate of between-species transmission is so low that H2 is rarely exposed to the disease. this case may occur when a disease is transmitted through close contact and thus has little chance of transmission between species. this case represents a potential emerging infectious disease in which the pathogen will become self-sustaining in H2 once the initial barrier to infection has been crossed. pathogens in taxa with high mutation rates, antigenic diversity, and short generation times may rapidly adapt to new hosts (28,29) pathogens in taxa with high mutation rates, antigenic diversity, and short generation times may rapidly adapt to new hosts. phylogenetic relationship between reservoir and target host will have consequences for disease emergence. pathogens harbored by reservoir host populations are of particular concern because they can drive target hosts to extinction. if R0>1, an initial infection can both become established and persist. in the stochastic reality of the natural world, an established infection may fade out, and reinfection from H1 could occur in the future. low between- and within-species transmission prevents the pathogen from persisting in the target host. increasing exposure of H2 to the pathogen leads to a gradual increase in both the prevalence of infection and the proportion of time the pathogen is present in H2. this increase applies even if within-H2 transmission is negligible (22 0) the horizontal lines are the deterministic approximations of the persistence threshold (given by R0 = 1 when 12 = 0) and the vertical lines are the deterministic approximations of the host extinction threshold. the horizontal lines represent different control scenarios for 2-host pathogen systems located at different points within the continuum. a single transmission event may spark an epidemic that completely decimates the population. the correct classification of the different regions of the community-epidemiology continuum are of more than just semantic importance. establishing the initial location of a novel host-pathogen system within the community-epidemiology continuum is essential for optimizing vaccination and culling strategies to lessen the impact of disease. the development of the community-epidemiology framework allows us to clarify the wealth of terminology currently used to describe disease occurrence in host communities. understanding the dynamics of disease persistence in novel hosts has never been more important. human populations understand the dynamics of disease persistence."}
