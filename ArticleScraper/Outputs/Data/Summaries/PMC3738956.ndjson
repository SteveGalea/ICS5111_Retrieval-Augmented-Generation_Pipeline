{"summary": "viruses do not encode a full complement of proteins that allow them to proliferate independent of the host. cyclophilins, a family of highly conserved peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerases, is a family of highly conserved peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans. cis isomers are poor substrates and are cleaved at a rate determined by the spontaneous isomerization of proline. the enzyme was shown to be involved in the refolding of urea-denatured ribonuclease A, a cellular protein. in humans, this protein is the 18 kDa cyclophilin A (hCyPA) encoded by the gene PPIA. some CLDs did not exhibit PPIase activity when tested in vitro. even the single domain cyclophilins may have PPIase-independent roles such as protein chaperoning. yP;SnuCyP-20] (PPIH) NM_006347 Nucleus; Cytoplasm 19 kDa Y mRNA processing; splicing [37,38,39] CyPL1 (PPIL1) NM_016059 Nucleus 18 kDa Y mRNA processing [40,41,42] CyP60 (PPIL2) NM_014337 Nucleus; Golgi 59 kD the rapamycin/FKBP complex targets the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway to inhibit T cell proliferation. a non-immunophilin class of PPIase, the parvulin-like proteins, has also been described. the mechanism by which CyPA functions to facilitate HIV infection is not fully understood. the ability of CyPA to bind HIV capsid also contributes to an intrinsic immunity mechanism that underlies species-specific restriction of HIV infection. early attempts to establish HIV infection in non-human primate cell lines revealed a dominant, capsid-dependent block post-entry. the restriction function of the unfused TRIM5 is also dependent on CyPA. a role of CyPA in HIV pathogenesis is also supported by genome-wide association studies. a role of CyPA in HIV pathogenesis is also supported by genome-wide association studies. RanBP2 is a large protein containing a C-terminal CLD. it is a component of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) of which HIV relies on to transport replication intermediates. this interaction may influence PIC import and the integration preference of the viral genome. this was perhaps not surprising when considering the high expression of the CyPA isoform relative to other members of the CyP family. intriguingly, SNPs in the PPIA gene that destabilize CyPA can protect hepatocytes from HCV infection in cell culture. a recent report showed that CyPA could also interact with the interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) [108] in vitro. the significance of the interaction remains unclear. NS5A-CyPA interaction has strongest experimental support. combination of IFN-a and CsA was more effective in achieving sustained virologic response than IFN-a monotherapy, especially in patients with genotype 1 virus, high viral load, or both [122,123] clinical trials of CsA derivatives lacking immunosuppressive function have shown that these compounds can potently suppress HCV viral load in patients and may become part of the future combination therapy against HCV. a common concern for targeting a host protein is the associated cellular toxicity. knockout studies in a human cell line and mice suggest CyPA is dispensable for basic cell survival. a parvulin PPIase could also inhibit tombusvirus in this model. cyclophilin interactions are unique to particular viruses or part of larger, broad themes is uncertain. cellular and viral substrates of cyclophilins are not fully defined. cyclophilins play a critical role in the host cell."}
