{"summary": "the CDC remains the basic management unit for TB control. a general hospital is designated to provide clinical care for TB patients. the study aims to explore factors that influence the integration of TB services in general hospitals. in many countries national TB programmes function vertically as part of the communicable disease control system. integration of TB services into primary health care has been common since the 1970s. but this has been less successful in parts of Asia where hospitals were not included in initial plans for rapid TB service expansion. the CDC was established during the national health sector reform since early 2000. many TB dispensaries were merged into the CDC as an affiliated department or a department combined with other public health programmes. the national CDC provides technical support and routine management of disease control programmes, including the National TB Programme (NTP) coverage, 80% of new smear-positive TB case detection, and over 90% treatment success rate. the CDC provides both clinical (diagnosis, treatment and clinical management) and public health functions. only complicated and severe TB cases are treated in the general hospitals. a general hospital was \"designated\" to undertake diagnosis, prescription and follow-up management, with other hospitals and health facilities referring those suspected of having TB to the designated hospital. a comparison of the TB functions between the two models is summarized in Table 1. Comparison of TB functions between the CDC and integrated model Functions. services Tuberculosis (TB) control is of great public health importance, particularly in many low- and middle-income countries. the world health organization (WHO) TB strategy, brand named \"DOTS,\" is based on five essential elements: political commitment; case detection using sputum microscopy; standardized short course chemotherapy; regular drug supply; and monitoring and evaluation. china has one of the highest TB burdens in the world, with more than 1.3 million new cases each year. TB control in china has benefited from a series of measures to strengthen the public-health system following the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003. by 2005, china achieved the global targets for TB control, with complete DOTS coverage, 80% of new smear-positive TB case detection, and over 90% treatment success rate. the CDC provides both clinical (diagnosis, treatment and clinical management) and public health functions. only complicated and severe TB cases are treated in the general hospitals. the CDC continues to provide public health functions such as referral management, reporting, staff training and case tracing. a general hospital was \"designated\" to undertake diagnosis, prescription and follow-up management, with other hospitals and health facilities referring those suspected of having TB to the designated hospital. research sites were selected from different economic development regions. two districts were selected from the database of the China National TB Programme. a prefectural general hospital in GN provided TB services since 1996. 22 999 Cure rate of new smear positive TB cases (%) 88.5 89.8 Number of general hospitals in the district 10 46 Data collection Purposive sampling techniques were employed to select participants based on their disciplines and roles. 21 individual interviews were conducted, 11 at SC and 10 at GN, in the autumn of 2008. transcripts of each interview were read through and coded into the related themes and sub-themes. coding was an iterative process which allowed to revise existing themes. a structured, focused approach was used to identify similarities and differences across the two sites. health bureau coordinates 4-5 special meetings annually. the health bureau solved the problem. two districts were selected from the database of the TB programme. xi(GN) had much higher GDP per capita and TB expenditure per person than GN. both sites had similar cure rates of new smear positive TB cases. interviews were conducted by a core research team, mainly consisting of TB researchers from the university of Leeds based in China (XW, GZ and JY) and Shandong University (QS) each interview lasted approximately 40-50 minutes, and was audio recorded with permission of the interviewees. a structured, focused approach was used to identify similarities and differences across the two sites. a structured, focused approach was used to identify similarities and differences. a member of research staff, not involved with data analysis, revisited emerging themes. historical context, clinical capacity, motivation for integration, resource allocation, incentive and staffing, management coordination, and technical exchange. results Seven categories of factors which influenced TB service integration were: historical context, clinical capacity, motivation for integration, resource allocation, incentive and staffing, and management coordination. the complexity of TB service delivery structure had resulted in poor coordination and management of TB care. in 2002, the prefectural general hospital was designated to fully provide the TB service. in 2005, the prefectural general hospital was designated to fully provide the TB service. motivation for integration appeared to be mixed within the two hospitals. GN's hospital began to treat TB in 1996. some recalled they did not want to take over the full TB service. a lack of funding may have contributed to the hospital attempting to make additional money from treating TB patients. the estimated annual hospitalization rate of the TB patients was up to 20%. CDC staff were just sympathetic to the hospital's financial dilemma: \"we could only open an eye and shut an eye\" in both sites, both doctors and nurses rotated from infectious disease or respiratory departments on a regular basis. there was serious concern over staffing turn-around and its effect on quality of service. TB doctors in both sites thought they did not receive fair pay regardless of their qualifications and experiences. a group of TB-related health professionals met regularly to discuss TB diagnosis and quality of x-ray examinations. in GN, TB staff in the hospital attended the general TB training sessions organized by the CDC. in GN, TB staff in the hospital attended the general TB training sessions organized by the CDC. the similarities and differences of the two sites in the process of integration are summarized in Table 6. the similarities and differences of the two sites in the process of integration are summarized in Table 6. the similarities and differences of the two sites in the process of integration are summarized in Table 6. may affect the quality of integration Staffing and incentives Attracting and maintaining skilled TB staff a challenge Management coordination Leadership mechanisms in place Personal relationships count Leadership mechanisms in place Official coordination from the health bureau counts Technical exchange Participatory and collaborative approach. the integration process was found to be contingent on the restructuring process of the public health organizations. the complexity of TB service delivery structure had resulted in poor coordination and management of TB care. in 2002, the prefectural general hospital was designated to fully provide the TB service. in 2005, the prefectural general hospital was designated to fully provide the service. motivation for integration appeared to be mixed within the two hospitals. GN's hospital began to treat TB in 1996. some seemed to be happy with full integration as they thought treatment could improve their reputation. a lack of funding may have contributed to the hospital attempting to make additional money from treating TB patients. the estimated annual hospitalization rate of the TB patients was up to 20%. CDC staff were just sympathetic to the hospital's financial dilemma: \"we could only open an eye and shut an eye\" in both sites, both doctors and nurses rotated from infectious disease or respiratory departments on a regular basis. there was serious concern over staffing turn-around and its effect on quality of service. TB doctors in both sites thought they did not receive fair pay from the hospital. a group of TB-related health professionals met regularly to discuss TB diagnosis and quality of x-ray examinations. in GN, TB staff in the hospital attended the general TB training sessions organized by the CDC. in GN, TB staff in the hospital attended the general TB training sessions organized by the CDC. the hospital staff felt that they received sufficient technical support from the district and municipal CDC during the initial period of integration. the similarities and differences of the two sites in the process of integration are summarized in Table 6. Factors influencing the integration of TB services in Shanghai Changning. TB cases, more profit and clinical-orientated care may affect the quality of integration Staffing and incentives Attracting and maintaining skilled TB staff a challenge Management coordination Leadership mechanisms in place Personal relationships count Leadership mechanisms in place Official coordination from the health bureau counts Technical exchange Participatory and collaborative approach. a strong political commitment from health bureau is the key to motivate and engage the hospitals. a strong political commitment from health bureau is the key to motivate and engage the hospitals. a strong political commitment from health bureau is the key to motivate and engage the hospitals. hospitals may suffer from a \"reallocation\" of the TB control budget from the CDC. integration requires transfer of funds for care from the CDC to the hospital. different practices of hospitalizing TB patients in SC and GN could also reflect conflicts. experiences from both sites highlight the importance of dialogue and flexibility [34,35], informal communication [11,36], and good governance [11,34] to sustaining such collaboration. a powerful intermediary actor, such as health bureau can play a positive role in mediating such collaboration. policy implications Our results add to existing research on factors that influence integration of TB into hospitals. the TB programme has long been working in parallel with the general health services. integration involves the shift from a specialized organization to a horizontal one. government funding has improved for public health facilities such as CDC. distorted incentives constrain the patient-orientated care provision. hospitals may suffer from a \"reallocation\" of TB control budget from the CDC. a more collaborative and participatory inter-organizational approach was observed in the more affluent eastern China site. a more collaborative and participatory inter-organizational approach was observed in the more affluent eastern China site. the CDC and hospital had long-lasting competitive relationship often due to challenges in resource allocation and poor communication. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors' contributions GZ, XW, JW, QS and JY were involved in conception and design of the project. all authors read and approved the final manuscript."}
