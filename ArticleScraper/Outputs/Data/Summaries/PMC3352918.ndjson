{"summary": "SARS-CoV is a positive single-stranded (ss) RNA virus with one of the largest known RNA genomes (29.7 kb) following infection, there is translation of two large replicative polyproteins, the pp1a (the ORF1a polyprotein) and the pp1ab (the polyprotein made from the ORF1a and ORF1b through a 1 ribosomal frameshift during translation) this auto-proteolysis leads helicases were initially thought to be molecular engines that unwind nucleic acids during replication, recombination, and DNA repair [16], recent reports have shown that they are also involved in other biological processes. nsp13 is thought to interact with other non-structural proteins, such as nsp7, nsp8 and nsp12 [31], [32] and probably contribute to the formation of a replication complex. studies were conducted using constructs of nsp13 fused with maltose binding protein (MBP-nsp13) and hexahistidine (H6-nsp13) additional studies demonstrated that the amplitude of DNA unwinding by H6-nsp13 increases with longer 5\u2032-overhang containing DNA substrates. nsp13 has 26 cysteine residues, 14 of which are highly conserved [34] helicase activity of nsp13 is enhanced in the presence of nsp12. this suggests that these proteins also interact in a functional replication complex. results allow mechanistic comparisons with other viral or eukaryotic helicases. 6-nsp13 was the slowest of the three enzymes and that GST-nsp13 is faster than the other variants by up to three orders of magnitude. we also compared the ATPase activities of these three variants of nsp13. the initial rate constants were then plotted against [ATP] and the data were fit to a hyperbolic function. GST-nsp13 or H6-nsp13 was pre-incubated with 31/18-mer and rapidly mixed with various concentrations of -32P-ATP. the reaction products were separated by thin-layer chromatography and visualized by autoradiography. nsp13 does not exhibit a significant preference for either RNA or DNA substrates. a similar lack of preference was also observed for MBP-nsp13 and H6-nsp13 variants [34], [35]. no nsp13 variants could unwind substrates with 3\u2032-end single-strand overhang or blunt-end DNA and RNA duplexes. this was shown using the 48/18-mer and 55/18-mer substrates (Figure S1), which mimic one of the stem loop structures present at the 5\u2032 UTR of SARS-CoV genome. the kinetic step size for GST-nsp13 was calculated by pre-incubating excess of GST-nsp13 with partial-duplex substrates. the experimental data for all the substrates were fit globally to equation (1) derived from Scheme 1. the individual uncorrected kinetic step size for different lengths of dsDNA varied from 14.3 to 16.4. each identical step in the reaction pathway is defined by a forward rate constant, ku, and a dissociation rate constant, kd. each identical step in the reaction pathway is defined by a forward rate constant, ku, and a dissociation rate constant, kd. ed step-size (bp)b 18 1.1 16.4 7.3 30 1.9 15.8 10.5 40 2.6 15.4 11.5 60 6.3 9.5 7.9 The kinetic parameters presented in this table are determined from the reaction mechanism presented in Figure 4A. the kinetic step size m is defined as the (LTL0)/n, where n is the number of intermediates. evidence from yeast-two-hybrid experiments suggested that SARS-CoV polymerase (nsp12) interacts with nsp13. results showed that 500 nM nsp12 clearly enhanced the unwinding rate (mkU, base-pairs per second) of nsp13. the rate of unwinding 31/18-mer DNA increased from 0.70.05 to 1.80.07 (mkU, base-pairs per second) the effect on the amplitude is more significant with the substrate with longer duplex region, 80/60-mer DNA substrate (Figure 5). mku b(bps1) nsp13 0.250.02 29.30.1 6.3 9.5 7.9 231.50.6 nsp12+nsp13 0.520.01 37.60.0 3.5 17.1 14.3 538.00.1 Total length of dsDNA (60 bp) at the outset of reaction (a) final 10 bps are separated without direct helicase action (b) mk u b(bps1) GST-nsp13 RNA 0.720.02 24.152.1 7.3 17615 GST-nsp13+nsp12 RNA 0.730.02 51.064.7 7.3 37334 GST-nsp13+FMDV pol RNA 0.720.02 24.542.0 7.3 17915 GST-nsp13 DNA 0.730.02 28.412.2 7.3 20716 GST-nsp13+n GST-nsp13, GST-nsp13, and H6-nsp13 helicase and ATPase activities were compared using 100 nM of each enzyme and 5 nM 60/40-mer (20ss:40ds) as DNA substrate. the results showed that GST-nsp13 unwound half of the substrate in 0.1 seconds, whereas MBP-nsp13 and H6-nsp13 reached the same unwinding level most subsequent experiments for biochemical characterization were performed with GST-nsp13. comparison of the helicase activity at varying time points for GST-nsp13 (glutathione S-Transferase-tagged nsp13), MBP-nsp13 (Maltose Binding Protein-tagged nsp13) and H6-nsp13 (hexahistidine-tagged nsp13) using 100 nM of the data were fit to a single exponential equation to calculate initial hydrolysis rates. the data were fit to a hyperbolic function to determine the (A) GST-nsp13 optimal ATP hydrolysis rate khydro(ATP) 104.14. s1 and (B) H6-nsp13 optimal ATP hydrolysis rate khydro(ATP) 0.20.006 s1 (two independent experiments) helicase activity of 100 nM nsp13 was measured with 5 nM of each of the substrates at 30\u00b0C for 5 secs. four different substrates with 5\u2032 overhang lengths varying from 5 to 20 nucleotides were designed to determine the minimum length of loading strand required by nsp13 to efficiently unwind its substrate. GST-nsp13 could not unwind the 23/18-mer that has only 5 bases ssDNA at the 5\u2032-end, but it did unwind the 28/18-mer (10 bases ssDNA at 5\u2032-end), 31/18-mer (13 bases ssDNA at 5\u2032-end), and 38/18-mer (20 bases at 5\u2032-end), suggesting that it requires more than 5-base-long 5\u2032-loading strand. the length L T of the dsDNA substrate decreased from 14.3 to 16.4. previous studies have shown that the last 8\u201310 bp of dsDNA can melt spontaneously in the presence of an active helicase[38]. therefore, it is essential to take into consideration the length of dsDNA that spontaneously melts when calculating the kinetic step size. data were fit to the equation A = Pn and the processivity, P, of nsp13 was estimated from the amplitude A and number of steps n and found to be 0.800.03. Kinetic parameters of DNA unwinding by GST-nsp13. the average kinetic step size m was estimated to be 9.42.1 bp per step. nsp13 unwound nucleic acid with a processivity of 0.800.03. helicase activity of nsp13 is enhanced by nsp12. 500 nM of nsp12 was used because optimal unwinding of nucleic acid by nsp13 in the presence of nsp12 was observed at this concentration. the effect of nsp12 on the ATPase activity of nsp13 was examined. no enhancement of the ATPase activity was observed. time course of DNA (5 nM. 80/60-mer) unwinding by 100 nM GST-nsp13 in the presence of 0 nM nsp12H6 (), 250 nM nsp12H6 () and 500 nM nsp12H6 () the products were separated and analyzed by 6% non-denaturing PAGE and the fraction of DNA unwound was plotted against reaction time.
