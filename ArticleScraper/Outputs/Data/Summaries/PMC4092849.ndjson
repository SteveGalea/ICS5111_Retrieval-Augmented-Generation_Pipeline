{"summary": "protein ubiquitination involves a series of cellular enzymes in an enzymatic cascade. it involves the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 and the Ub ligase E3, which form an isopeptide bond between the carboxyl terminus of Ub and the -amino group of a lysine residue on the target protein. the final outcome of the first round of the ubiquitination cascade is the mono-ubiquitin ubiquitination of the cytoplasmic domains of transmembrane proteins results in their sorting to lysosomes via the multivesicular body (MVB) pathway. ubiquitination of the cytoplasmic domains of transmembrane proteins results in their sorting to lysosomes via the multivesicular body (MVB) pathway. a number of Ub-like (UbL) proteins can be conjugated to target substrates by specific enzyme-like proteins. SUMO (Small Ub modifier), ISG15 (Interferon-stimulated gene 15), NEDD8 (Neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated 8), FAT10 (HLA-F adjacent transcript 10), Atg12 (Autophagy-related protein 12) and LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain proteasome inhibitors have been shown to interfere with the replication of major human pathogens such as herpesviruses [15,16], poxviruses [17,18], hepadnaviruses [19], hepadnaviruses [20], hepadnaviruses [20], influenzaviruses [21], retroviruses [22,23,24], coronaviruses [25], picornaviruses [27] and the UPS is linked to the ability of the human pathogen KSHV to penetrate into endothelial cells and to traffic to the nuclei. in all these cases, specific viral proteins which function as transcriptional transactivators are able to interact with the Ub/UbL-conjugating machinery. in all these cases, specific viral proteins which function as transcriptional transactivators are able to interact with the Ub-conjugating machinery. NF-kB is a complex of dimeric transcription factors, which in mammals comprises RelA (p65), RelB, c-Rel, NF-kB1 (p50) and NF-kB2 (p52) viruses prevent the induction of NF-kB and/or IFN. rotavirus NSP1 protein mediates the ubiquitination and degradation of the -transducin repeat containing protein (-TrCP) that otherwise would bind to and degrade IkB. viruses can act downstream the IFN induction, by inhibiting the signal cascade activated by IFN binding to its receptor. TRIM5 and many other members of this family of ISGs function by ubiquitinating, SUMOylating or ISGylating host/viral proteins with different outcomes on the antiviral response. it has been demonstrated that ISG15 displays a broad antiviral activity [55], even though the mechanism/s accounting for this effect is/are still under investigation. rotavirus NSP1 protein leads to -TrCP ubiquitination and degradation through the recruitment of the ubiquitin-ligase complex Skp-1/Cul1/F-Box (SCF) small DNA viruses with known oncogenic activity take control of the cell cycle by usurping specific cellular Ub ligases to target crucial cell cycle regulators such as p53. studies of viral interactions with the host cell cycle have been instrumental in the identification and characterization of p53 and pRB. different viruses have been reported to affect the APC function. the human cytomegalovirus encodes a protein, pUL21a, that is able to induce proteasome-dependent degradation of APC subunits during viral infection. several additional cellular DUBs are known to increase their activity. the disregulation of this signaling pathway has been implicated in tumor development. the study of EBV interference with the Wnt pathway and the role played by the cellular DUBs in this context are relevant. ICP0 is able to disassemble cellular protein aggregates, known as promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML NBs), that are present in the nucleus of infected cells. both herpesviruses and adenoviruses have been described to interfere with PML NBs.

ICP0 is able to disassemble cellular protein aggregates, known as promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML NBs), that are present in the nucleus of infected cells. both herpesviruses and adenoviruses have been described to interfere with PML NBs. boname et al. 2011 [68] Tetherin/BST-2 Boname et al. 2011 [68] Pardieu et al. 2010 [82] ICAM-1 Timms et al. 2013 [81] Isaacson et al. 2009 [80] Boname et al. 2011 [68] B7-2 CD1d HFE PECAM ALCAM MIC-A/-B AICL DC-SIGN DC-SIGNR Lang et TBK1 TRAF6 TRAF3 Hepatitis B Virus HBx RIG-I Jiang et al. 2010 [95] TRAF3 Moreover, viral DUBs have been described. a role for these viral DUBs during both the entry and the egress of the virus from infected cells is very likely. a list of viral proteins with recognized deubiquitinating enzyme activity is reported along with the characterized substrates. cytomegalovirus UL48 unknown Kim et al. 2009 [102] PseudoRabies Virus UL48 unknown Bottcher et al. 2008 [103] Kaposi Sarcoma-associated herpesvirus ORF64 RIG-I Inn et al. 2011 [104] RTA IRF-7 Isaacson et al. 2009 [80] Epstein-Barr Virus BPLF1 EBV ribonucleot HIV-1 is a lentivirus and is characterized by a non-icosahedral particle enwrapped in a lipidic envelope. it is characterized by a non-icosahedral particle enwrapped in a lipidic envelope. its genome comprises two copies of single-stranded RNA with a short dimerized region. the common genetic elements characterizing the proviral DNA of a retrovirus are reported along with the LTR. the relevance of HIV-1 as human pathogen has allowed to deeply dissect several aspects of HIV biology. cullin-RING finger Ub ligase complex usurped by the HIV-1 Vif, Vpu and Vpr accessory proteins with the respective target proteins and biological effects that have been identified so far. this feature has been exploited to optimize the chances of HIV-1 to overcome different restriction factors evolved by the cells to inhibit viral replication and spreading. APOBEC3G is clearly expressed in vif-defective HIV-1 nonpermissive cells where it acts as an intrinsic restriction factor. APOBEC3G is clearly expressed in vif-defective HIV-1 nonpermissive cells where it acts as an intrinsic restriction factor. Vif-CBF--ElonginB-ElonginC-Cullin5-Rbx E3 complex polyubiquitinates APOBEC3G leading to proteasomal degradation. APOBEC3G is not incorporated into viral particle and HIV-1 can replicate in de novo infected cells. additional APOBEC molecules have been characterized for their ability to restrict vif-defective HIV-1. tetherin is a type II transmembrane protein with a topology consisting of an N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane domain, a coiled-coil extracellular domain, and a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor at the carboxy-terminus. tetherin is also one of the major cross-species barrier factor especially in the context of lentiviral infection. studies have revealed a -TrCP2-independent mechanism of tetherin antagonism by Vpu. degradation does not appear to be the primary system by which Vpu counteracts BST-2. other viral proteins are able to counteract tetherin function by inducing its Ub-dependent degradation. uracil-DNA glycosylase (UNG) 2 and single-strand selective monofunctional uracil-DNA glycosylase (SMUG1) do not account for the above described Vpr effect. it is well known that also the endoribonuclease Dicer is involved in the generation of miRNA, with enhanced HIV-2 replication in monocyte-derived macrophages. HD1 is a nucleotide triphosphohydrolase that can inhibit reverse transcription by depleting the intracellular pool of available dNTPs. it has been reported that HIV Vpr and Vpx exploit not only cullin4A but also cullin4B to mediate ubiquitination of target proteins. Vif recruits a multi-subunit E3 Ub ligase complex composed of a scaffold protein, Cullin 5, RING-box protein, a SOCS box binding protein complex, Elongins B/C. the complex is then able to polyubiquitinate APOBEC3G leading to its proteasomal degradation. this finding will help clarify the molecular basis of Vif function. Vpu acts as adaptor protein, directly interacting with CD4 in the ER and with -TrCP, leading to the CD4 polyubiquitination, dislocation from the ER to the cytosol and proteasomal degradation [124]. tetherin is a type II transmembrane protein with an unusual topology consisting of an N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane domain, a coiled-coil extracellular domain, and some studies have indicated a Vpu mediated -TrCP-dependent proteasomal degradation of tetherin [125,126] there are also data supporting a role for the -TrCP-dependent endo-lysosomal pathway in BST-2 degradation [127,149]. pr and Vpx Vpr are a 96 amino acid protein whose function has been difficult to elucidate. it interacts with the cullin4A-DDB1-DCAF1 Ub ligase complex. the exact target/s of Vpr-cullin4A-DDB1-DCAF1 activity linked to the arrest is/are still unknown. myeloid cell types are less permissive to HIV-1 infection with respect to CD4-positive T lymphocytes. this difference in susceptibility to HIV-1 infection has been linked to the expression in myeloid cell types of the Vpx-interacting protein SAMHD1 [133] studies on retroviruses, and in particular on HIV-1, have been instrumental in dissecting the complex viral/cellular interplay. the Gag polyprotein is the only retroviral protein necessary at this level. this feature allowed the development of viral mutants and tools to identify molecular mechanisms involved in budding. a functional L-domain leads to Gag ubiquitination [23] and when directly fused to different retroviral Gags, Ub can functionally replace the L-domains [179,180]. the PPXY type of L-domain interacts with the members of the Nedd4-like family of ubiquitin ligases by directly binding the WW domain characteristic of these cellular proteins. the vesiculation process taking place during endocytosis is topologically opposite to the one occurring during viral budding. however, during endocytosis the vesicles bud into the cytoplasm and membrane fission is driven by dynamin from outside of the bud neck. this apparent discrepancy between experimental data started to find a solution thanks to the seminal discoveries of the Carter\u2019s laboratory [197] and the Sundquist\u2019s group [ a protein needs to be removed from the plasma membrane, it is ubiquitinated and endocytosed on the surface of endosome. then a budding of vesicles from the membrane into the lumen of the endosome takes place. this vesiculation event leads to the biogenesis of the MVB, which will eventually fuse with a lysosome resulting in the degradation of its cargo. details on the ESCRT proteins and on other MVB key factors can be found in several comprehensive reviews [7,169,173,201,202]. ubiquitination is necessary and sufficient to trigger the ESCRT-dependent endosomal sorting of membrane proteins and their degradation through the MVB/lysosomal pathway. ination of Gag would mimic ubiquitination of transmembrane proteins along the endocytic/MVB pathway, thus mediating the engagement of the ESCRT components. ubiquitination of Gag proteins can increase also in the absence of a functional L-domain and when budding is inhibited. we have tried to give an overview of the complexity of the interplay between viruses and Ub/UbL-conjugating systems. more work needs to be done to clarify the functional relevance of Ub involvement in specific steps of viral replication, such as viral budding."}
