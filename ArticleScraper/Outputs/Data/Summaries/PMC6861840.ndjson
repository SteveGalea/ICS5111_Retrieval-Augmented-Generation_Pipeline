{"summary": "classical swine fever virus (CSFV) is a worldwide and highly contagious disease of pigs. the disease is notifiable to the world organization for animal health (OIE) pigs with a very high mortality rate have suffered economic losses to the pig industry worldwide. endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an important membranous organelle in eukaryotic cells. dysfunctions of the ER occur and lead to accumulation of the misfolded/unfolded proteins in the lumen of the ER. the ER responds to the burden of ER stress by activating a set of intracellular signaling pathways to restore normal function of the ER. ER stress and activation of the UPR signaling are general host responses to flavivirus and coronavirus infection. replication of these viruses is closely associated with ER-derived membranes. however, the relationship between CSFV infection in vivo and ER stress-driven UPR remains unclear. autophagy is the best studied autophagic process. autophagy functions as a pro-survival process in most cases by relieving cells from various stress conditions. excessive or uncontrolled autophagy even triggers a form of non-apoptotic cell death. autophagy is tightly regulated by several cellular signaling pathways. all three UPR pathways of PERK, ATF-6, and IRE1 have been demonstrated to participate in autophagy induction. however, which UPR pathway is activated to mediate the induction of autophagy. the relationship between ER stress-mediated autophagy and diseases still needs to be clarified. porcine kidney cell lines PK-15 (ATCC, CCL-33) and porcine macrophage cell lines 3D4/2 (ATCC, CRL-2845) were respectively cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle medium (DMEM, Gbico, C11995500BT) the cells were grown at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator (thermo Fisher Scientific, HERAcell 150i) with 5% CO2.

porcine macrophage cell lines 3D4/2 (ATCC, CRL-2845) were respectively cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle medium (DMEM, Gbico, C11995500BT) the cells were grown at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator. inant plasmid pMD18-T-NS5B was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and sterile ultrapure water as stock solutions. the primary antibodies used in the study were specific for GRP78 (Santa Cruz, sc-13968), phosphor-IRE1 (S724) (Abcam, ab48187), phospho-eIF2 (S51) (Bioworld, BS4787), eIF2 (S goat anti-rabbit IgG(H + L) (A0208) and goat anti-mouse IgG(H + L) (A0216) were purchased from Beyotime Biotechnology. pigs were randomly divided into two groups: a mock group and a CSFV infection group. pigs were sacrificed at 7 dpi to confirm infection of CSFV. pathological changes of immune

results of both RT-PCR and IHC showed that E2 expression was positive in immune organs from CSFV-infected pigs rather than mock-infected pigs. the results demonstrated the successful establishment of a pig model for CSFV infection in vivo. images were captured with a NIKON Eclipse Ci biological microscope (Japan) under a magnification of 200. appreciable brown staining is considered as positive expression of E2 proteins. bar, 100 m. rrhage in the superficial cortex and long arrows show a large amount of inflammatory cell infiltration in the mesenchyma. inflammatory cell infiltration (long arrow) can be seen in infected lung (F) no obvious histopathological changes were obtained in infected liver (G) infection caused severe hemorrhagic and necrotic inflammation in tonsils, spleen, thymus and lymph nodes. these were characterized by the infiltration of massive erythrocytes and inflammatory cells among the tissue cells and the extensive lymphocytes depletion and tissue necrosis. pulmonary hemorrhage, consolidation and interstitial pneumonia, tubular degeneration and necrosis were observed in the CSFV-infected pigs. a standard curve was constructed using 10-fold serially diluted standard plasmids. the viral loads were determined using the linear regression plot. there was no detectable expression of CSFV genes in organs collected from mock-infected pigs. viral genes were differentially detectable in these organs. in terms of NS5B copies/g tissues from the experimental pigs (B\u2013D) were determined using the linear regression plot. each template was ran in triplicate. ER stress is a potential strategy used by many viruses to regulate viral replication for effective infection. the PERK pathways in these organs were significantly suppressed. no obvious activation of ATF-6 pathway was obtained in these organs. the results suggest that ER stress-mediated UPR pathways are associated with CSFV replication in vivo. many viruses have developed specific strategies to regulate autophagy. ER stress-driven UPR is one of the important pathways to regulate autophagy. the details in vivo and the underlying mechanism need to be further investigated. CSFV infection in vivo differentially induces autophagy in infected organs. ER stress and autophagy are associated with the replication of CSFV in infected organs. cine Cell Lines ER stress-mediated autophagy has been well studied due to its significant role in many diseases. the effects of pretreatment with TG and inhibitors (4-PBA and TUDCA) on autophagic activities in the PK-15 and 3D4/2 cells were analyzed with real-time RT-PCR and Western blot assays. the similar results were obtained in cultured 3D4/2 cells. it suggested that upregulation of ER stress to some extent increases autophagic activities in CSFV-infected cells. treatment with ER stress inhibitors 4-PBA and TUDCA markedly inhibited ER stress in PK-15 cells. treatment with ER stress regulators changes transcriptional levels of autophagic genes in PK-15 and 3D4/2 cells. PK-15 (A,B) and 3D4/2 (C,D) cells cultured in 6-well plates were pretreated with 50 nM TG or 200 M TUDCA or 500 M 4-PBA for 6 h. cells pretreated with only DMSO were regarded as the control group. PK-15 cells cultured in 6-well microplates were pretreated with ER stress agonist TG (12.5, 25 and 50 nM) (A), ER stress inhibitors 4-PBA (125, 250 and 500 M) (D) and TUDCA (50, 100 and 200 M) (G) for 24 h. cells pretreated with only MDRV or mock infection or only drugs were regarded as the control group. the indicated concentrations of TG (A), 4-PBA (D) and TUDCA (F) prior to viral infection were quantitated by BCA assays. samples were loaded for western blot analyses using specific antibody against the indicated targets. tubulin was used as a loading control. treatment with ER stress agonists (TG) induces a dose-dependent increase in viral titers measured by TCID50 assays in CSFV-infected cells compared with the control group. however, viral titers were significantly inhibited by treatment with varying concentrations of ER stress inhibitors (4-PBA and TUDCA) autophagy regulators altered both copies of NS5B genes and viral titers in cultured cells. TUDCA treatment further reduced 3-MA-decreased viral replication. TG pretreatment effectively elevated 3-MA-decreased viral replication. similar results were obtained in the PK-15 and 3D4/2 cells. the cells and supernatants of each treatment were collected for virus titration determined with TCID50 assays. each sample was assayed in four replicates and the data represent the mean SD values of two independent experiments. the results are expressed as mean SD values of two independent experiments. the average body temperature of pigs in the mock group was maintained between 38.3 and 39.9\u00b0C. the average body temperature of pigs in the mock group increased to the top (41.6\u00b0C) at 3 dpi, and thereafter remained at 40.8\u201341.2\u00b0C, displaying a high fever retention state. a pig model for CSFV infection was established in vivo. 10 healthy 2-month-old pigs with CSFV and CSFV antibody negative were randomly divided into two groups. pigs in the mock group were only injected the same volume of PBS. the experimental pigs were sacrificed at 7 dpi and the indicated organs were collected for pathological analyses. macroscopic examination was performed immediately after sacrifice of the experimental pigs; bar: 10 mm. steatosis (short arrow) and interstitial cell hyperplasia with concomitant inflammatory cell infiltration (long arrow) in the portal area were observed in infected liver (G) no obvious histopathological changes were obtained in infected heart, except for slight swelling of cardiomyocytes (H) pulmonary hemorrhage, consolidation and interstitial pneumonia, renal hemorrhagic inflammation, tubular degeneration and necrosis were observed in the mock-infected pigs. however, there were no histopathological changes observed in the mock-infected pigs. as for other organs, slight hemorrhage and interstitial hepatitis were observed. viral loads in immune organs and partial non-immune organs of the infected pigs were generally higher than those in heart, liver and brain. viral loads in organs with severe pathological changes were higher than those in organs with slight pathological changes. fected Organs ER stress has been shown to be a potential strategy used by many viruses to regulate viral replication for effective infection. the status of CSFV infection has been demonstrated by real-time RT-PCR and IHC assays. the status of CSFV infection has been demonstrated by real-time RT-PCR and IHC assays. CSFV-induced ER stress appeared to be more serious in organs with severer pathological changes and higher viral titers. relatively mild ER stress was detectable in organs with slighter pathological changes. ER stress-mediated UPR pathways are associated with CSFV replication in vivo. our previous study has revealed that CSFV-induced autophagy is beneficial to its replication in vitro. the details in vivo and the underlying mechanism need to be further investigated. we further investigated the effect of CSFV infection on the expression of autophagic proteins in immune and non-immune organs. CSFV infection in vivo differentially induces autophagy in infected organs. ER stress and autophagy may be linked to autophagy, which needs to be further confirmed. pretreatment with ER stress agonists (TG) and inhibitors (4-PBA and TUDCA) analyzed with real-time RT-PCR and Western blot assays. treatment with TG, a potent inhibitor of Ca2+ transport ATPase to disturb ER homeostasis and cause ER stress, increased ER stress and autophagic indicators. TUDCA markedly inhibited CSFV-induced ER stress in PK-15 cells. similar results were obtained in 3D4/2 cells. ER stress regulators markedly changed copy numbers of CSFV-NS5B genes in both PK-15 and 3D4/2 cells. treatment with ER stress regulators changes transcriptional levels of autophagic genes in PK-15 and 3D4/2 cells. cells cultured in 6-well plates were pretreated with 50 nM TG or 200 M TUDCA or 500 M 4-PBA for 6 h. PK-15 cells cultured in 6-well microplates were pretreated with ER stress. agonist TG (12.5, 25 and 50 nM) (A), ER stress inhibitors 4-PBA (125, 250 and 500 M) (D) and TUDCA (50, 100 and 200 M) (G) for 6 h, respectively, and then subject to CSFV infection. samples were quantitated by BCA assays and then loaded for western blot analyses using specific antibody against the indicated targets. the effects of ER stress or autophagy regulators on CSFV replication in PK-15 and 3D4/2 cells were analyzed with real-time RT-PCR and TCID50 assays. treatment with ER stress agonists (TG) induces a dose-dependent increase in viral titers measured by TCID50 assays in CSFV-infected cells. ER stress inhibitors (4-PBA and TUDCA) confirm requirement of ER stress in CSFV replication in vitro. autophagy regulators altered copies of NS5B genes and viral titers in cultured cells. ER stress-mediated autophagy can be a potential mechanism for regulating CSFV replication. autophagy-regulated replication in cultured PK-15 and 3D4/2 cells can be mediated by ER stress. cell viability measured by the CCK-8 assays after treatments with the indicated concentrations of TG (12.5, 25 and 50 nM), 4-PBA (125, 250 and 500 M) each sample was assayed in four replicates and the data represent the mean SD of two independent experiments. PK-15 (E) and 3D4/2 (F) cells cultured in 6-well plates were pretreated with 50 nM TG or 200 M TUDCA for 6 h. no cytopathogenic effect is detectable in cultured cells infected with CSFV. this makes it difficult to understand replication and pathogenesis of viruses. previous studies have revealed that CSFV infection induces ER stress and autophagy to facilitate viral replication in vitro. immune organs, kidney, lung and intestine were higher than those in other organs. severities of tissue injury are positively correlated with tissue viral loads of CSFV. the underlying mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon are seldom investigated. factor XBP1(s) up-regulates UPR genes encoding ER chaperones and components of the ER-associated degradation machinery to restore ER homeostasis. Activated ATF-6 translocates into the nucleus and activates the transcription of ER chaperones for promoting protein folding, transport, and ER expansion. a great number of viruses can induce ER stress and differentially activate the three UPR pathways during their infection. the increasing expression in CHOP induced by CSFV may be associated with the elevated caspase-3 and PARP cleavation. the remarkable lymphocyte reduction is very likely attributed to the ER stress-mediated apoptosis. however, whether ER stress-mediated apoptosis is induced and its underlying mechanisms during CSFV infection need further confirmation. a remarkable decrease in autophagy substrate p62 suggested induction of autophagy in these organs. no obvious autophagy was detectable in the infected organs with slighter pathological changes and lower viral loads. this suggests that induction of autophagy during CSFV infection in vivo is tissue-specific and may be associated with CSFV replication in vivo. s have revealed that many viruses can trigger autophagy through the UPR signaling pathways. if a cytoprotective autophagy or an autophagic cell death is induced upon ER stress, probably depend on the types of viruses and cells. s have suggested a potential link between CSFV-induced ER stress and autophagy. CSFV infection induces ER stress and autophagy in vivo and in vitro. pharmacological regulation of ER stress by ER stress agonists (TG) and inhibitors (4-PBA and TUDCA) remarkably changed the autophagic activities in CSFV-infected cells. ER stress-mediated autophagy is exploited as a replication-favoring strategy by DENV and HCV. treatment with ER stress agonists (TG) or autophagy inducer (RAPA) remarkably increased CSFV replication in cultured cells, but the replication of CSFV was significantly reduced in the cells incubated in the presence of ER stress inhibitors (4-PBA and TUDCA) ER stress-mediated autophagy contributes to bluetongue virus infection via the PERK signaling pathway. ER stress-mediated autophagy contributes to viral replication in the infected hepatocytes. ER stress-mediated autophagy contributes to bluetongue virus infection via the PERK signaling pathway. conflict of interest The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
