{"summary": "infection studies in bats are limited to the identification of specific pathogens presenting a potential health threat to humans. but the impact of infectious agents on the individual host and their importance on bat mortality is largely unknown. most bat species are listed in the IUCN Red list of endangered species. almost half of these are considered threatened or near-threatened. research has been focused on bat biology, ecology and behavior. carcasses of deceased bats found in germany were kindly provided by bat researchers and bat rehabilitation centers. most animals represented individual cases that were found dead, injured or moribund near human habitation. most animals represented individual cases that were found dead, injured or moribund near human habitation. carcasses were immediately stored at 20\u00b0C and shipped to the leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research, Berlin, Germany, for diagnostic investigations. if bats died in care or had to be euthanized for animal welfare reasons, the carcasses were immediately stored at 20\u00b0C. sections were cut at 2\u20135 m and routinely stained with hematoxylin-eosin. special histological staining methods were used depending on microscopic findings. causes of death were rigorously standardized with the primary cause of death identified as the most serious injury, disease or event subsequently fatal to the animal. biochemical tests were applied to confirm Api test results. 16S rDNA gene analysis was performed for final identification. isolates were characterized at the national reference laboratory for the analysis and testing of zoonoses. gene was extracted from organ homogenates using the NucleoSpin\u00ae Tissue Kit (Macherey-Nagel) genetic identification of the bat species was performed by amplification and sequencing of a 241 bp fragment of the cytochrome B (cytB) gene [38] using primers FM up (5\u2032- CCC CHC CHC AYA TYA ARC CMG ART GAT A -3\u2032) and FM down (5\u2032- TCR ACD GGN age class ranked between 1 and 4 with increasing age (i.e. neonates, juveniles, subadults, and adults) for endoparasitic analysis, we defined a 3 level variable \u2018bat size\u2019 according to the body size of a certain bat species to reduce degrees of freedom of the full model. to detect effects of seasonality, 4 different activity periods were specified according to the date of sampling. analysis data set(total n) Sex(% males) Age(% adults) Bat species(total n) Full dataset Bat samples 486 55.6 67.5 19 Subset 1 Causes of death 433a 55.0 65.4 19 GLMM: disease-

this variable had not been significant as fixed effect. but from other studies we can assume that there are species-specific differences in susceptibility of bats to certain infectious agents and therefore included it as random effect. noctula were collected from tree hibernacula destroyed during wood logging. nine dead juvenile Pipistrellus pipistrellus were collected from a nursery roost. a brain sample of each bat was submitted to the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute, Wusterhausen, Germany, for rabies diagnosis. a full necropsy was performed on each bat and all macroscopic findings including ectoparasite infestation were recorded. colony morphology, hemolysis, Gram-staining, indol production, catalase and oxidase reaction were used. primary identification of bacterial strains was based on colony morphology, hemolysis, Gram-staining, indol production and catalase. for 180 out of 210 bats PCR assays could only be applied for 4 different bat herpesviruses. internal controls were used for all PCR assays to test for inhibition. all retrieved fragments of bat herpesvirus-specific PCR assays were checked for sequence identity to previously published isolates. a rapid multiplex PCR assay was performed using primers PIP-F (5\u2032- CTC ATT CAT TGA YCT ACC AGC -3\u2032), PIP-R (5\u2032- CAG CRA ATA GTA AAA TAA CTC C -3\u2032) and Ppip-F (5\u2032- CAT CTG TTT GGG ACT

disease susceptibility and infection rates. disease-related mortality in bats is influenced by sex, age and species-specific differences, and degree of endoparasitic infection. all statistical analyses were performed using the R software V. 2.13.1. we used the chi-square test for given probabilities to evaluate significant differences in the sex ratio among bats of different species. for hypotheses A and B, we used a generalized linear mixed modeling approach with bat species included as random effect. three bat species, the common pipistrelle (P. pipistrellus, n = 138), the noctule bat (N. noctula, n = 92) and the serotine bat (E. serotinus, n = 53) constituted about 60% of all bat carcasses investigated in this study. animals in their first year of life represented one third (n

Helminthes were predominantly found in the gastro-intestinal tract of the bats, while in some animals, granulomatous organ lesions were associated with larval migration of nematode species. the noctule bat (N. noctula, n = 92) and the serotine bat (E. serotinus, n = 53) constituted about 60% of all bat carcasses investigated in this study. the overall sex ratio was 1.5 males to 1 female with significant species-specific differences. animals in their first year of life represented one third of bat samples. in window 1 0.2 - - 1 - 1 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 81 bats revealed moderate to severe pathological changes of unknown etiology or unconfirmed bacterial or viral cause. fatal bacterial (n = 54), viral (n = 5) and parasitic infections (n = 2) were observed in 42% of individuals. significant age- and sex-dependent differences (AIC = 23.13) were detected between the general causes of mortality, disease and trauma. the disease presence in bat samples decreased continuously with increasing age. a significant trend in disease-associated mortality between the sexes. 2.13 0.03 Vespertilio murinus 1.56 0.55 2.83 0.005 Eptesicus nilssonii 2.01 0.75 2.68 0.007 Pipistrellus pipistrellus 2.04 0.27 7.42 0.0001 Eptesicus serotinus 2.06 0.43 4.75 0.0001 Plecotus auritus 2.40 0.74 3.25 0.001 Pipistrellus nathusii 2.74 0.73 3. the GLMM analysis revealed low sex- and age-dependent differences in bacterial infection (AIC = 1.97) female bats (21.9%) and adults (21.6%) showed marginally higher prevalence of bacterial disease compared to males (18.3%) and to other age classes (15.6%), respectively.
