{"summary": "cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) was used to detect changes in organ cell layer thickness. it was shown to be a good method for identifying significant real-time changes of cells. this is the first real-time study to show that, FGF-9 plays an important role in epithelial invagination. ectodermal organogenesis involves the development of many ectodermal organs. despite diverse forms and functions, ectodermal organs exhibit common developmental features. morphogenesis drives further development of the epithelial and mesenchymal components and is associated with epithelial folding and branching. ectodermal organs are greatly affected by their in vivo environment and its inherent regulating factors. bioengineered ectodermal organs can be developed from murine molar tooth germs by dissociating the epithelial and mesenchymal layers into single cells. this bioengineered organ germ method [10] could facilitate regeneration of other ectodermal organs, even new engineered organs. electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) is a real-time, label-free, impedance-based method to study the activities of cells. it is a real-time, label-free, impedance-based method to study the activities of cells including morphological changes, locomotion, and other behaviors. bioengineered organ-ECIS model provides a non-invasive, controlled environment for the real-time investigation of specific factors. results FGF-9 promotes epithelial invagination for ectodermal organogenesis. liminary results showed that FGF-9 can induce early expression of the homeobox protein Msx genes Msx-1 in mesenchymal cells. these findings were concurrent with the gene expression of mesenchymal origin cells, such as odontoblasts, during the early stage of tooth development. the experimental group also showed earlier epithelial differentiation in molar tooth germs at 1 and 10 days in vitro. MTT assay for in vitro culture of dissociated mesenchymal and epithelial cells. concentrations of 25 and 40 ng/ml were both suitable for cell culture in the first 7 days. ng/ml in the four experimental wells to detect enhanced epithelial cell layer invagination into the established mesenchymal layer. early impedance of the FGF-9 group was always lower than the control group, although not significantly. accelerated epithelial invagination occurred before this time point. accelerated epithelial invagination occurred before this time point. accelerated epithelial invagination occurred before this time point. -actin served as an internal control for real-time 7900HT PCR. we monitored Ameloblastin expression at 12, 60, 72, 84 and 150 h. -actin was an internal control for real-time 7900HT PCR. real-time PCR Amelogenin expression at different time points of the bioengineered organ culture. peak Ameloblastin expression at 60 h is followed by a peak Amelogenin expression at 72 h. significantly higher Amelogenin expression also coincides with early lower impedance data. preliminary results showed that FGF-9 can induce early, significant Ameloblastin, Amelogenin and Osteocalcin expression in mesenchymal cells cultured with FGF-9. the experimental group also exhibited earlier epithelial differentiation in molar tooth germs at 1 and 10 days in vitro. the rate of tetrazolium reduction is proportional to the rate of cell proliferation. we found FGF-9 with 40 ng/ml concentration was the best for promoting cell proliferation in both dissociated epithelial and mesenchymal cells. we separated the epithelial and mesenchymal layers, obtaining single cells. we added 2 105 epithelial cells to each well of the ECIS 8W10E kit. waited 25 h for settling and reaggregation and obtained stable impedance. accelerated epithelial invagination occurred before this time point. accelerated epithelial invagination occurred before this time point. accelerated epithelial invagination occurred before this time point. FGF-9 accelerates and sustains Ameloblastin and Amelogenin expressions. mRNA detection at different time points to determine factors underlying ectodermal organogenesis. evidence suggests that addition of FGF-9 induces early Ameloblastin expression. some early phenotypic characteristics of ameloblasts existed within the epithelial layer and accelerated epithelial invagination. amelogenin expression was significantly higher at 72, 84 and 150 h in the FGF-9 group compared with the control group. ectodermal organs are always affected by the surrounding in vivo environment. ectodermal organs are always affected by the surrounding in vivo environment. ectodermal organs are always affected by the surrounding in vivo environment. mesenchymal cells induc early mesenchymal expression of crucial odontogenic genes Msx-1, Ameloblastin and Amelogenin. inducing early mesenchymal expression of the crucial odontogenic genes Msx-1, Ameloblastin and Amelogenin (Additional file 1), and accelerating and sustaining early Ameloblastin and Amelogenin secretion within the tooth germ. this could explain why FGF our FGF-9 group exhibited faster mesenchymal cell integration in the first 3\u20134 days than previous studies. this could explain how FGF-9 accelerates epithelial invagination in murine odontogenesis by facilitating cross-talk and reunion between mesenchymal cells and stimulating epithelial cell layer differentiation. a significant, proximal\u2013distal pattern exists within the lower jaw epithelium of the mouse embryo. both BMPs and BMPs target the Notch signalling pathway through the Jagged 2 gene, regulating tooth morphogenesis and cytodifferentiation. this suggests a specific counterbalanced relationship exists between FGFs and BMPs. we propose an \u2018FGF-BMP balancing system\u2019 which manipulates the morphogenesis of ectodermal organs. \u201c\u201d is the downregulated pathway proved by previous researches and our study. \u201c\u201d is the suggested pathway need to be investigated further. the separated layers were stored immediately in 400 l Spinner modified ca2+-free minimal essential medium (SMEM; Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) at 4\u00b0C in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. we added 0.01 g protease XIV (Sigma) and 0.02 g DNase (Bioshop Canada Inc., Burlington, CA, USA) to 5 ml SMEM. we added 2104 cells/well epithelial and mesenchymal cells to a 96-well plate. after 1, 4, 7 and 14 days\u2019 incubation, we removed the medium, added 30 l/well MTT solution in darkness, then incubated for 3 h at 37\u00b0C. 7900HT real-time polymerase chain reaction gene expression assay and statistical analysis. we used 48-well plates for Ameloblastin and Amelogenin analysis. we converted mRNA to cDNA using a High Capacity RNA-to-cDNA Kit. we centrifuged the mixture (3500 rpm, 4\u00b0C, 5 seconds) to spin down the contents of each well. after 7900HT PCR, we pooled the data from SDS 2.4 into RQ Manager 1.2.1 to determine the average relative quantity of each sample. then used a base-10 logarithm to determine gene expressions. the separated layers were stored immediately in 400 l Spinner modified ca2+-free minimal essential medium (SMEM; Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) at 4\u00b0C in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. we added 0.01 g protease XIV (Sigma) and 0.02 g DNase (Bioshop Canada Inc., Burlington, CA, USA) to 5 ml SMEM. mm filter (Millipore), covered it with aluminium foil and stored it at 4\u00b0C. we added 200 l/well of a range of FGF-9 concentrations to mesenchymal cells. after 1, 4, 7 and 14 days\u2019 incubation, we removed the medium, added 30 l/well MTT solution in darkness, then incubated for 3 h at 37\u00b0C. 7900HT real-time polymerase chain reaction gene expression assay and statistical analysis. we used 48-well plates for Ameloblastin and Amelogenin analysis. we converted mRNA to cDNA using a High Capacity RNA-to-cDNA Kit (Invitrogen) we performed 7900HT PCR to determine relative gene expressions over time. we marked at least four samples for each time point from the control and FGF-9 groups. we divided the cDNA from each sample into three wells to determine the expression of each gene in triplicate assay. upregulation of Msx-1 and weak expression of Msx-2 evident in this study agree with previous research [14]. osteocalcin was upregulated by FGF-9 in the first week. results highlight the importance of FGF-9 in ectodermal organogenesis. eight embryonic tooth germs were cultured, 4 for experimental group cultured with FGF-9, 4 for control group cultured without FGF-9. only simple epithelium and mesenchyme in the tooth germ was found."}
