{"summary": "bunyaviruses constitute the largest RNA virus family and infect a wide range of hosts. the virus is transmitted from ticks to humans, with human to human transmission occurring on rare instances. the case-fatality rate is approximately 10% in China, with the elderly being disproportionately affected. te entry into dendritic cells depends on the cellular lectin DC-SIGN [15], which can interact with pathogens in a glycan-dependent manner. expression of this protein is required for efficient SFTSV infection of cell lines. elucidating the processing and function of these proteins might reveal targets for antiviral intervention. the integrity of a predicted signal sequence at the N-terminus of Gc is essential. the cellular enzyme signal peptidase liberates Gc from the Gn/Gc precursor. this process is required for viral infectivity. expression plasmids for SFTSV-Gn (aa 1\u2013543) and SFTSV-Gc (aa 536\u20131073) were generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cloning of PCR products into plasmid pCAGGS using asp718 and XhoI restriction sites. the start codon of Gc within the Gn/Gc precursor sequence was mutated by PCR using the primers 5\u2018-CCAGT the PCR product encoding mutRRxR-2 was directly inserted into pCAGGS using MluI and XhoI restriction sites. the PCR products encoding mutRRxR-1 and mutATG-Gc-RRxR-1 were first inserted into pcDNA3.1zeo containing a partial SFTSV fragment followed by insertion of the entire coding sequence into pCAGGS via Asp718 and XhoI restriction culin fused to GFP [27], and pE-GFP-Golgi, which encodes beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase fused to GFP [28], were used to visualize the endoplasmic reticulum and the golgi apparatus. analysis of glycoprotein expression and cleavage 293T cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 250,000 cells per well, incubated for 24 h and then calcium- expression of viral glycoproteins was analyzed with mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against the V5 tag. a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) and a chemiluminescence-based commercially available kit were used for visualization of bound antibodies. signal intensities were performed using Fiji/ImageJ 1.51g software. sk and calcium-phosphate-transfected with 6 g of the glycoprotein expression plasmid. cells were transduced at an MOI of 0.2 with a replication-defective vesicular stomatitis virus (VSVG) pseudotyped with VSV-G and encoding luciferase and green fluorescent protein (GFP) twenty-four hours post transduction rhabdoviral pseudotypes were harvested from the culture supernat cal microscopy cells were seeded on glass coverslips in 24-well plates at 40,000 cells per well and incubated for 24 h at 37\u00b0C. cells were calcium-phosphate cotransfected with 0.5 g of plasmids encoding viral glycoproteins (SFTSV-Gn-myc and/or SFTSV-Gc-V5 or SFTSV-Gc-V5) and marker proteins localized to the endoplasmic reticul glass coverslips were washed three times with PBS and again incubated upside down on 25 L droplets containing secondary antibodies. Alexa fluor 647 donkey anti-mouse IgG (Life Technologies, Eugene, OR, USA) and Alexa fluor 546 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Life Technologies, Eugene, OR, USA) diluted 1:1,000 in PBS supplemented with 0.5% Tween and 1% BSA in PBS. plasmids were encoding severe fever and thrombocytopenia syndrome virus glycoprotein (SFTSV-Gn/Gc) [15], Rift valley fever virus glycoprotein (RVFV-Gn/Gc) [15], La Crosse virus glycoprotein (LACV-Gn/Gc) [25], Ebola virus GP (EBOV-GP) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus spike protein (MERS-S) with and without C-terminal mutRRxR-1 and mutATG-Gc-RRxR-1 were inserted into plasmid pCAGGS using asp718 and XhoI restriction sites. the inner primers 5\u2018-CCAGTGCACCACGGCTGCAGGTCTGGCCATCTCGATCC-3\u2018 and 5\u2018-CCAGTGCGCCATCATGCGCGC-3\u2018 served as inner primers for generation of mutant mutRRxR-2. primers 5\u2018-GGCAACCAGGACGACGTGCGGATCGAG GGCTGTGACGAAATGGTGCAC-3\u2019 and 5\u2018-GTCGCGCGCGAC-3\u2019 were used as inner primers to generate SFTSVSigP-V5 (536\u2013560) the integrity of all PCR-amplified sequences was confirmed by in house (German Primate Center) automated sequence analysis (Sanger method) decyl sulfate (SDS)-lysis buffer (1.5 ml 1M Tris pH 6.8, 6 ml 80% Glycerol, 10 ml 10 x SDS, 2.5 ml -mercaptoethanol, 5 ml 1% bromphenol blue, 50 l 1M EDTA) transfected cells were resuspended in denaturing buffer, incubated at 100\u00b0C for 10 minutes and then exposed to 500 units rhabdoviral pseudotypes were harvested from the culture supernatants via sterile-filtration through 0.45 m filters. target cells were treated with the inhibitors from 6 h post transfection until cells were harvested. 293T cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 30,000 cells/well. at 24 h post seeding, cells were incubated with 50 l pseudotyped virus for 1 h. transduction efficiency was quantified by determining luciferase activity in cell lysates. glass coverslips were washed once with PBS followed by fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at RT. samples were blocked for 30 min with PBS containing 0.5% Tween and 1% bovine serum albumin. all images were cropped to 70% of the original image for presentation purposes. no further image modifications were performed. results The SFTSV-Gn/Gc precursor protein is efficiently processed into Gn and Gc. a weak signal of the molecular weight expected for the SFTSV-Gn/Gc precursor (116 kDa) was detected. results indicate that SFTSV-Gn/Gc and other bunyavirus Gn/Gc precursor proteins were efficiently processed into mature proteins under the conditions studied. a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based pseudotyping system previously shown to be suitable for analysis of SFTSV-Gn/Gc-driven entry [15]. expression of Gn alone was not sufficient to render particles infectious, despite efficient particle incorporation of the protein. particles produced in the presence of Gc did not harbor Gc and were not infectious. results suggest both Gn and Gc are required for infectious SFTSV entry. both proteins are required for host cell entry. findings posed the question whether Gn facilitates virion incorporation of Gc. expression of Gc alone is not compatible with particle incorporation and infectivity. they showed that simultaneous particle incorporation of both Gn and Gc is associated with infectivity. cells seeded on glass coverslips were cotransfected with plasmids encoding indicated glycoproteins (panel A: SFTSV-Gn-myc, SFTSV-Gc-V5 or SFTSV-Gn/Gc-V5) at 48 h post transfection, immunofluorescence staining was performed using antibodies directed against the antigenic tags as primary antibodies. no further image modifications were performed in separate experiment. mutant mutATG-Gc-RRxR-1 and mutRRxR-2 are dispensable for Gn/Gc processing. RRxR motifs and methionine at position 1 within Gc are dispensable for Gn/Gc processing. rhabdoviral pseudotypes analyzed in panel C were used for transduction of 293T cells. rhabdoviral pseudotypes analyzed in panel C were used for transduction. blockade of a serine protease activity previously shown to be required in target cells for efficient Gn/Gc-driven entry [15] was dispensable for processing of SFTSV Gn/Gc. the sequences near the predicted cleavage site in the signal peptide of other phleboviruses showed high similarity to the sequences of signal peptides deposited in the MEROPS database. both deletions completely abrogated Gn/Gc processing (Fig 6B) and particle infectivity (Fig 6D) 293T cells were transfected with empty plasmid (pCAGGS) or pCAGGS encoding SFTSV Gn/Gc wt or Gn/Gc with signal peptide deletions. a single representative blot is shown from which irrelevant lanes were excised. glycoproteins of EBOV-GP and LASV-GPC were analyzed as positive controls for glycoprotein processing. a weak signal of the molecular weight expected for the SFTSV-Gn/Gc precursor (116 kDa) was detected. asterisks indicate processed Gc (SFTSV, RVFV, LACV) or GP2 (EBOV, LASV) a single representative blot is shown from which irrelevant lanes were excised. similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based pseudotyping system. previously shown to be suitable for analysis of SFTSV-Gn/Gc-driven entry. expression of Gn alone was not sufficient to render particles infectious. transduction measured with particles generated in Gn/Gc expressing cells was set as 1. Particles harboring no glycoprotein (pCAGGS) were used as a control. three independent experiments performed with triplicate samples are shown. n facilitates transport of Gc to the site of viral budding, the Golgi apparatus. cellular proteins fused to GFP and known to localize to the endoplasmic reticulum (calreticulin) and the Golgi apparatus were employed as organelle markers. c are dispensable for Gn/Gc processing. predicted signal peptides at the N-termini of Gn and Gc. a potential cleavage site for proprotein convertases or related enzymes was detected. xR-1 and mutRRxR-2 in which RRxR motifs within the Gc signal peptide and in the Gc ectodomain were mutated as indicated. IV, mutant SigP, in which the signal peptide of Gc was deleted. RRxR motifs in Gc do not constitute cleavage sites for proprotein convertases or other cellular proteases. blockade of proprotein convertases inhibited processing of the LASV-GPC and EBOV-GP. cell lysates were lysed 48 h post transfection. expression of -actin was determined as loading control. predicted signal peptide in Gc is essential for Gn/Gc processing. processing of Gn/Gc into mature Gn and Gc proteins depends on the integrity of the predicted signal sequence in Gn/Gc. deletion of the Gc signal peptide abrogates Gn/Gc processing and Gn/Gc-driven entry. ral pseudotypes harboring the glycoproteins analyzed in panel A were used for transduction of 293T cells. the average of four independent experiments performed with triplicate samples was shown. transduction measured with particles generated in Gn/Gc expressing cells was set as 1. proprotein convertases are known to recognize the following consensus motif, (R/K)-2nX-R2 (with n 0\u20133 amino acids) neither mutation of the RRxR motifs in the context of Gn/Gc nor inhibition of proprotein convertase activity reduced processing of Gn/Gc. the impact of the methionine at position 1 of Gc on generation of Gc from its precursor, Gn/Gc. the four amino acid residues preceding the predicted cleavage site in SFTSV-Gc were found to be highly conserved among phleboviruses and residues -4 to -1 matched those most frequently found in signal peptides of cellular proteins. the deletion of the predicted Gc signal peptide in the context of SFTSV-Gn/Gc or the removal of the amino acids preceding the predicted cleavage site abrogated Gn/Gc particle infectivity was expected while the contribution of SFTSV-Gn was less clear. this suggests that Gn might function as a chaperon, which facilitates appropriate trafficking of Gc. a hydrophobic domain in the SFTSV-Gn cytoplasmic tail is responsible for the Golgi localization. a previous study reported that SFTSV-Gn binds to susceptible cells and interacts with the entry factor non-muscle myosin heavy chain IIA. it is conceivable that SFTSV-Gn facilitates trafficking and maybe folding of Gc and binds to entry factors while Gc drives fusion of viral and cellular membranes."}
