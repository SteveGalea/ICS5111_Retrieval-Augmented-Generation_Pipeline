{"summary": "incidence of RSV-associated ILI in the study population and coinfection of RSV with other respiratory viruses in ILI were also estimated. trial was a randomized, observer-blind, parallel group, multicountry trial of AS03-adjuvanted vs nonadjuvanted monovalent pandemic H1N1 vaccines. a 7-day symptom-free period was required between new ILI episodes. the primary outcome variable was PCR-confirmed RSV in nasal/throat swabs. single RSV infections and coinfections with other respiratory viruses were also recorded separately. the incidence per 100 person-years (PY) of RSV-associated ILI in the study population was calculated as follows. incidence rate = i = 1 n i i = 1 n i 100 where n is the total number of children enrolled, and i is the total number of RSV-positive ILI episodes for subject i. illance for Influenza-like Illness and Sample Analysis Passive surveillance was conducted from 2 weeks after first vaccination. contact was made every 1\u20132 weeks through day 385. one anterior nasal swab and 1 throat swab were collected ideally within 24 hours of ILI onset. clinical characteristics of the ILI episode were recorded. no contact with study personnel to collect nasal/throat samples. prevalence of RSV and other respiratory viruses among ILI episodes was calculated. the missing data were accounted for using an analysis. the missing proportion for each country and age group was calculated. of this total, 3717 ILI episodes that occurred in 2421 children were included in the present analysis. demographics in this group were also similar to those of the evaluated cohort. 98 (53.7) 61.5 (30.8) 0 (0) 43 (4.6) 80 (8.6) 98 (10.6) 262 (28.3) 444 (47.9) Costa Rica 444 230 (51.8) 58.1 (31.1) 0 (0) 26 (5.9) 51 (11.5) 51 (11.5) 104 (23.4) 212 (47.7) Mexico 1137 565 (49.7) 59.1 (31.5) 0 (0) 69 (6.1) 108 (9.5) 114 (1 116 (60.4) 50.5 (31.1) 0 (0) 17 (8.9) 31 (16.1) 30 (15.6) 42 (21.9) 72 (37.5) Mexico 435 232 (53.3) 49.2 (29.7) 0 (0) 43 (9.9) 64 (14.7) 43 (9.9) 139 (32.0) 146 (33.6) Philippines 724 366 (50.6) 42.6 (30.5) 0 (0) 81 (11.2) 172 (23.8) 140 (19.3) 132 (18.2) 199 all countries 3717 359 9.7 (8.7\u201310.7) 143 26 18.2 (12.2\u201325.5) 676 109 16.1 (13.4\u201319.1) 657 92 14.0 (11.4\u201316.9) 1050 88 8.4 (6.8\u201310.2) 1191 44 3.7 (2.7\u20134.9) Australia 111 18 16.2 (9.9\u201324.4) 5 0 0 (0\u201352.2) 24 6 25.0 (9.8\u201346.7) 14 3 21.4 (4.7\u201350 Philippines 1045 167 16.0 (13.8\u201318.3) 62 23 37.1 (25.2\u201350.3) 273 71 26.0 (20.9\u201331.6) 233 45 19.3 (14.4\u201325.0) 196 23 11.7 (7.6\u201317.1) 281 5 1.8 (2.3\u201319.6) 0...... 2 0 0 (0\u201384.2) 4 2 50.0 (6.8\u201393.2) 15 1 6.7 (.2\u201331.9) 28 1 3.6 (.1\u201318 no children aged 6\u201311 months in Australia, Colombia, Costa Rica, Singapore, or Thailand experienced an ILI episode associated with RSV infection. overall prevalence of RSV subtype A among ILI episodes was 3.0% and varied by country and age. across all age groups, it was highest in the Philippines (15.2%) and lowest in Mexico (0.9%). incidence per 100 Person-Years (95% Confidence Interval) of Influenza-like Illness Episodes in Which Respiratory Syncytial Virus was Detected. by Country and Age Group (Total Cohort) Age Group (Months) at time of Influenza-like Illness Episode 6\u201311 12\u201323 24\u201335 36\u201359 60+ Person-years Incidence Person-years Incidence Person-years Incidence Person-years Singapore NA NA 2.7 0 (0\u2013137.8) 8.1 24.7 (3.0\u201389.3) 18.6 5.4 (.1\u201330.0) 88.0 1.1 (.0\u20136.3) Thailand 5.1 0 (0\u201372.2) 43.7 2.3 (.1\u201312.8) 46.4 15.1 (6.1\u201331.1) 135.8 2.2 (.5\u20136.5) 179.5 0.6 (.0\u20133.1) Total number of ILI episodes = 3717. 80.4% of ILI episodes medically attended, RSV prevalence was 10.4% (95% CI, 9.3\u201311.6) overall incidence of RSV-associated ILI resulting in medical attendance was 6.6% (95% CI, 4.9\u20138.6) 5.3 (11.6\u201347.9) 107 5 6.8 (2.2\u201315.9) 186 14 7.3 (4.0\u201312.2) 173 6 1.8 (.7\u20133.9) Colombia 9 0 0 (0\u201359.2) 44 5 9.8 (3.2\u201322.8) 55 6 8.9 (3.3\u201319.4) 128 16 8.7 (5.0\u201314.1) 131 9 2.1 (1.0\u20134.0) Costa Rica 2 0 0 (0\u201381.1) 50 2 7.1 (.9\u201325 all children with ILI associated with RSV experienced fever (part of the case definition) a total of 23% of children experienced a sore throat and 39% experienced a stuffy nose (81%).

Almost all children with ILI associated with RSV experienced a new or worsening cough (96%) the median length of ILI episode associated with RSV was 8 days. a total of 29% of RSV-associated episodes resulted in absence from school or day care. only children in the 2 oldest age groups missed school or day care. study showed prevalence of RSV type A or B in ILI ranging from 4.2% to 16.2% across countries. prevalence declined with age, ranging from 18.2% in the 6- through 11-month age group to 3.7% in the >60-month age group. the Philippines and Mexico were the only countries with the highest incidence in infants aged 6\u201311 months. only 3.8% (143/3717) of ILI episodes occurred among children aged 6\u201311 months at the time of the episode. no children remained in the 6- through 11-month age group approximately 6 months post-enrollment. active surveillance studies tend to report higher prevalence and incidence of RSV than passive surveillance. in india, the incidence of RSV-associated LRTI was highest in infants aged 0\u20135 months (14.7 per 100 PY), with incidences of 5.9 to 8.8 per 100 PY in children aged 6\u201330 months. most ILI episodes were medically attended, with an overall incidence of RSV-associated ILI requiring medical attendance of 6.0 per 100 PY. only healthy children entered the efficacy trial (eg, no children with malnutrition) so that participants were healthier than those from a random community sample, thus, limiting generalizability. fever was recorded in approximately 70% of RSV-positive respiratory tract infections primarily in children aged 2 years 6 months [18, 19], so our findings are relevant only to older children."}
