{"summary": "studies of infectious diseases have constructed more accurate parameters of interpersonal contact, based on diary-approach surveys from both Europe [1]\u2013[4] and Asia [5] and other studies have used web-based surveys [6] or time-use methods [7] to ensure that such diary-based contact patterns provide accurate baseline data for policy implementation. a diary-based survey in Taiwan emphasizes the rigorous requirements on systematic probability sampling and in-person (face-to-face) household interviews to ensure proper inference to the population as a whole. only when the modeling of disease infections relies on surveys that target the right populations. study aims to gain insight into the patterns of interpersonal contact among Taiwan's 23 million residents. the survey was crucial, given the pandemic H1N1 influenza that caused world-wide concerns in 2009. the survey sampling and in-person household interviews were both conducted by the Academia Sinica, Taiwan. we followed the sampling procedures used in the well-established Taiwan Social Change Survey (TSCS) [21]\u2013[22]. we sampled 4,207 residents as our targeted respondents. these targets ranged from 1.4 to 4.0 times more than the expected successful sample size. a total of 41 trained interviewers visited respondents' residences to conduct face-to-face interviews. the simplified classification divides all respondents into only 2 groups. we compute contact probabilities for child 0\u20134, child 5\u201319, and adult 19\u201364 respectively. the case with which we compare is a simulation model for pandemic influenza in the united states. survey design Fielded in spring 2010 aimed to gain insight into patterns of interpersonal contact among Taiwan's 23 million residents. the survey aimed to gain insight into the patterns of interpersonal contact among Taiwan's 23 million residents. to capture the possible channel of air-borne transmission of influenza, we asked respondents to record physical contacts and those nonphysical contacts made within 2 meters. part of the diary log followed those used in recent studies elsewhere [1]\u2013[5]. a total of 41 trained interviewers visited respondents' residences to conduct face-to-face interviews to collect individual background information and details about all interpersonal contacts during the past 24 hours. a pandemic flu simulation system was developed at Academia Sinica, Taiwan. we calculate weighted contact duration by multiplying mean contact duration by mean contact frequency. by multiplying mean contact duration by mean contact frequency, we obtain weighted contact probabilities. we also compute contact probabilities for child 0\u20134, child 5\u201319, and adult 19\u201364 respectively. respondents were well distributed over all geographic regions. median age was 37, ranging from 0 to 97, with an interquartile range. median age was 37, ranging from 0 to 97, with an interquartile range. 1,943 contact diaries recorded a total of 24,265 contacted persons during the past 24 hours. the median age of these contacted persons was 33, with an IQR range from 17 to 48. young adults were also underrepresented among the contacted persons. nearly 70% of contacts occurred away from respondents' homes. 17.4% of contacted persons maintained infrequent contact with respondents. average number of persons in our 24-hour diaries reaches 12.5 (S.D. = 9.3). the adjusted contact probabilities would result in a slightly faster and more pronounced epidemic outbreak in Taiwan (Figure 2). a similar pattern can also be observed from the distribution of group infection cases. 0.0001450 0.00015 Anyone Child 5\u201318 0.0000544 0.000054 Anyone Child 0\u20134 0.0000181 0.000018 Figure 2. Distribution of infection cases with different sets of contact probabilities. we completed 1,954 successful interviews after two-and-a-half months of fieldwork. respondents were well distributed over all geographic regions and across different urbanization levels. the household size averaged 4.5. for those over 18 years old (adults), 56.4% were married, and 37.6% received college education. nearly 70% of contacts occurred away from respondents' homes (such as at school, in the workplace, on public transportation, during leisure time, etc.) about 17.4% of contacted persons had maintained infrequent contact with respondents (less often than weekly). average number of persons in our 24-hour diaries reaches 12.5 (S.D. = 9.3). the most active age group of all is schoolchildren (ages 5\u201314), who average around 16\u201318 contacts. the most active age group of all is schoolchildren (ages 5\u201314), who average around 16\u201318 contacts. 0.016 elementary school Child 5\u201318 Child 5\u201318 0.0435 8.42% 0.40 0.034 Middle school Child 5\u201318 Child 5\u201318 0.0315 8.42% 0.40 0.034 Workgroup Adult19\u201364 Adult 19\u201364 0.0575 5.78% 1.00 0.058 Neighborhood Anyone Adult 65+ 0.00087 0.00087 Anyone Adult 19\u201364 0.00058 0.00058 Anyone Child 5\u201318 0.0002175 0.00022 Anyone Adult19\u201364 0.0001450 0.00015 Anyone study in rural Vietnam collected 865 contact diaries showing that 85% of all contacts occurred at home and 93% were with those who kept in touch on a daily basis. compared with findings from european surveys, our systematic sampling helped obtain a sample that displays more diverse contact patterns. more country-specific findings are expected as an increasing amount of comparable diary-based probability survey data becomes available from other countries. preliminary analyses show that the Taiwanese have a different cross-generational pattern of interpersonal contact. large-scale probability survey helps generate contact diaries that are short-term yet representative. such studies should help efforts to implement more appropriate and effective strategies in controlling an emerging or pandemic disease infection."}
