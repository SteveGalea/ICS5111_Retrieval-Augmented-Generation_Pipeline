{"summary": "geographic variation for both epidemic and endemic infectious disease occurrence has important public health consequences. geolocation approaches are likely to have less utility for resource-poor settings where formal address systems are commonly unavailable. the accuracy and precision of three approaches to geolocate health facility attendees in a rural area of western Kenya. the study was conducted in a rural area of Rachuonyo South district, Nyanza Province in the western Kenyan highlands. the population mostly comprises people from the Luo ethnic group whose main occupation is subsistence agriculture. a questionnaire was administered to all consenting participants to obtain information on malaria indicators and their area of residence. a system of geocoding was developed to match \u2018postal addresses\u2019 to an existing spatial database. individuals have three names, two given and one family name. all likely matches were plotted in arcGIS v. 10.1 (ESRI, USA) the distance between the actual geolocated compound and the matched compound from the community survey was calculated. participants would attempt to locate the residence on the map and record the corresponding cell identifier. locations of participants followed to their compounds were plotted in ArcGIS. a compound was considered to be correctly located if it fell within the catchment area or intersecting catchment areas that matched the response provided at the facility. health-facility catchment based on Euclidian distance model. primary school catchment area based on cost-distance model. cost-distance function to account for factors that may either impede or facilitate travel was also used to delineate landmark catchment areas. the mean error for both methods was calculated as the distance between the border of the catchment and the location of the incorrectly located compound. the distance between each compound and the centroid of each polygon could have been calculated. however, due to the irregular shape of many of the polygons, the distance to the centroid would generate a large error rate and be misleading. five rural health facilities were identified whose catchments overlapped with community-based cross-sectional surveys being performed. cross-sectional malaria surveys in the health facilities were conducted in October 2011 and in July 2012. the method would be useful in areas that have existing and updated registries with accompanying spatial information. names from the two databases were matched using stata v. 12.1. possible matches, where the matching probability was 80%, were checked manually. each block/cell combination was given a unique numeric identifier. the system (including size of polygon) was selected because it was familiar to the field workers and would provide them a better frame of reference for facilitating the exercise. participants would attempt to locate the residence on the map and record the corresponding cell identifier. locations of compounds were plotted using ArcGIS. a compound was considered correctly located if it fell within the catchment area or intersecting catchment areas that matched the response provided at the facility. cost-distance models for both health facilities and primary schools were created using IDRISI software (Clark Laboratories, USA) and imported into ArcGIS for analysis. the

those that could not be traced were mainly due to running out of time and inaccurate information provided at the facility. results of participatory mapping exercise, Rachuonyo South, Kenya,

community cross-sectional malaria survey. CI 612\u2013684) of 695 participants who attempted the mapping exercise were successfully located to the appropriate 2 25 km block. when a 500 m buffer in all directions around the block was included, the proportion correctly located improved to 82% (95% CI 789\u2013848) at the block level and from 124% (95% CI 100\u2013150) to 571% (95% CI 533\u2013608) at the cell level. median distance of compounds incorrectly located from identified cells was 539 m (IQR 236\u20131095 m), 1055 m (IQR 737\u20131644) including a 500 m buffer, and 1588 m (IQR 1200\u20132180 m) the proportion of people correctly identified to a specific block or cell significantly varied per facility. the combined responses were able to locate individuals based on the combination of responses with 724% (95% CI 678\u2013768) of compounds successfully located to an area of 37 km2. the mean area reduced to 17 km2 and 487% (95% CI 436\u2013536) of participants' compounds were correctly located. results show a logarithmic relationship between mean catchment area and proportion of compounds correctly identified. using the location of the nearest primary school as well as the participatory mapping with buffer was the most promising method to geolocate rural health-facility attendees. methods based on name-matching or participatory mapping to the 500 500 m cell level proved to be less accurate, but are capable of greater spatial precision. the ideal geolocation approach in a rural setting will ultimately depend on the information available, the objectives, whether it be monitoring for epidemics or planning for disease control interventions. free imagery with good resolution is becoming more widely available for even remote areas in rural and low-income settings. a similar exercise could be conducted using web-based platforms as is increasingly being used for disaster response. the analysis using the cost-distance catchment areas showed a lower error rate based on the distance from the edge of the catchment area. the ideal scale will depend on the spatial pattern of the disease and the size of the area of interest. spatial coordinates were only available for government-run primary schools in the area, thereby restricting the sample to those residing near these schools. spatial coordinates were only available for the government-run primary schools, thereby restricting the sample to those residing near these schools. further research is needed to demonstrate their utility in a range of settings."}
