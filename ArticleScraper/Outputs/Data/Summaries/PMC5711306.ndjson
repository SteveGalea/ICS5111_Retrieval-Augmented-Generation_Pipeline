{"summary": "CDC maintains a pool of trained OHZDP workshop facilitators to conduct workshops and train in-country facilitators to promote country ownership of the prioritization process. variables collected are number and type of workshop participants by sector (voting members and observers), disease assessment criteria selected during the workshop and the resulting zoonoses rankings. in-country facilitators represented ministries of health (n = 8), agriculture (n = 5), environment (n = 1), and wildlife (n = 1); research institutes (n = 2); CDC in-country staff (n = 2); and other partners (n = 2). the average number of voting members per workshop was 15, but excluding 2 outlier workshops that grouped voting members. the total number of voting members for all workshops was 107. countries: Thailand, Kenya, Ethiopia, Azerbaijan, Cameroon, South Africa, Democratic Republic of the Congo. zoonoses on these lists were classified as 41.4% (range 27.8%\u201351.3%) bacterial, 37.7% (range 28.0%\u201344.4%) viral, 18.3% (range 13.9%\u201325.0%) parasitic, 2% (range 0%\u201311.1%) fungal, and 0.8% (range 0%\u20134%) prion in nature. countries average assigned weight (range) Economic, environmental, and/or social impact 7 0.193 (0.150\u20130.210) Economic impact only 3 Economic and/or social impact 2 Availability of interventions (i.e., vaccines and/or medical treatment) 6 0.183 (0.160\u20130.200) Epidemic/pandemic potential (and/or sustained transmission in humans) 6 0.202 (0.160\u20130.220) Case-fatality rate 3 Morbidity and/or mortality rate 3 Presence of disease in country eria Questions and Responses Six of the 7 countries created 1 single or compound question for each selected criterion. one country created 2 separate questions for 4 of their 5 criteria, for a total of 9 questions. seven (17.5%) questions had a binary response whereas most (82.5%) had >3 possible responses per criteria question. one country had 4 diseases that shared the no. 4 ranking place. one country had both B. abortus and B. melitensis on its ranked list. five countries chose a final list of 5 prioritized zoonoses, 1 country chose 6, and 1 country chose 3. the most common zoonoses seen on the final prioritized lists remained the same as the original ranked list. two countries prioritized only endemic zoonoses. a total of 21 in-country facilitators were trained at 5 of the 7 workshops. in-country facilitators represented ministries of health (n = 8), agriculture (n = 5), environment (n = 1), and wildlife (n = 1); research institutes (n = 2); CDC in-country staff (n = 2); and other partners (n = 2). % Total for all workshops (range) Public health, n = 7 5 (3\u20136) 35.5 (16.7\u201350.0) Wildlife, n = 2 5.5 (3.75\u20137.25) 10.3 (0\u201340.1) Research institution, n = 3 3 (2\u20135) 10.3 (0\u201325.0) Environmental health, n = 3 1 (1\u20132) 4.7 (0\u201325) each list, on average, included 37 (range 25\u201343) diseases or syndromes. zoonoses were classified as 41.4% (range 27.8%\u201351.3%) bacterial, 37.7% (range 28.0%\u201344.4%) viral, 18.3% (range 13.9%\u201325.0%) parasitic, 2% (range 0%\u201311.1%) fungal, and 0.8% (range 0%\u20134%) prion in nature. countries average assigned weight (range) Economic, environmental, and/or social impact 7 0.193 (0.150\u20130.210) Economic impact only 3 Economic and/or social impact 2 Economic, environmental, and/or social impact 2 Availability of interventions (i.e., vaccines and/or medical treatment) Criteria Questions and Responses Six of the 7 countries created 1 single or compound question for each selected criterion. one country created 2 separate questions for 4 of their 5 criteria, for a total of 9 questions. six countries ranked viral, bacterial, and fungal zoonoses. 2 countries also ranked parasitic diseases. 1 country ranked only viral diseases. two countries agreed to adjust their lists to incorporate other zoonoses that the voting members felt should be in the top 5. one country chose to adjust the order of the rankings to better reflect importance but retained the same zoonoses. five of the seven countries included both endemic and emerging zoonoses. one country had both B. abortus and B. melitensis ranked separately on the final prioritized list. results Six of 7 countries planned follow-up activities as part of the workshop. CDC successfully carried out 7 OHZDP workshops in Thailand, Kenya (27), Ethiopia (28), Azerbaijan, Cameroon, South Africa, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. the OHZDP process is unique in that it enables country-led decisions using multisectoral approach to prioritize both emerging and endemic zoonotic diseases. CDC-trained OHZDP workshop facilitators conduct workshops and train in-country facilitators to promote country ownership of the process. most voting members were from the human (35.5%) and animal (30.8%) health sectors, but additional sectors were represented where available. most prioritized zoonoses were endemic, illustrating that countries wanted to focus their limited resources on diseases for which they could successfully implement enhanced diagnostic capacity, surveillance, and proven interventions. these activities will enhance the capacity of countries to rapidly detect, respond to, and contain public health emergencies, including outbreaks of zoonotic diseases. zoonotic disease prioritizations were conducted during or in the wake of the 2014 west africa outbreak (11) this event likely influenced the outcome for 1 country that prioritized Ebola despite the disease not being endemic or a likely risk in the country or region. the GHSA uses a one health multisectoral approach to strengthen the capacity at the global and national levels to prevent, detect, and respond to human and animal infectious disease threats. to detect and respond to new and emerging diseases that may occur and become a threat to global health security."}
