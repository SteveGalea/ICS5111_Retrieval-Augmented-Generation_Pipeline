{"summary": "a 2000 sow farrow-to-grow swine operation in southwestern Ontario experienced an outbreak of PED in February 2014. the operation observed a closed herd policy, raised their own replacement breeding stock, and maintained strict biosecurity protocols. the herd was positive for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae. sensitivity and agreement between different environmental test methods to detect PEDV under commercial farm conditions. the study involved the collection of 2 environmental sample types per pen from selected farrowing pens with an individual Swiffer cloth and an individual Dacron swab. at the start of the study, approximately 5 mo following the initial outbreak, all of the farrowing pens on the farm were surveyed. some fluid feces visible on the floor of the farrowing crate 18.2 (42) 21.2 (25) 16.5 (41) 2 Fluid feces clearly visible on the floor. there is equal proportion of normal feces 1.3 (3) 12.7 (15) 0.0 (0) 3 Majority of fecal material is liquid 1.7 (4) 2.5 (3) 0.8 (2) a Diarrhea score assigned to the pen environment. a third visit to the farm occurred 45 d after the first visit and initial sampling and 31 d after the second visit. 30 Dacron swab samples from the farrowing area were collected and pooled (5:1). the diarrhea scores for the nursery rooms ranged from 1 to 2. there was variability in the number of pens per room affected. all pooled environmental samples from the farrowing area were negative for PEDV, PDCoV, TGE, RVB and PCR-positive for RVA and RVC. the third visit was designed to assess the status of the farrowing area with longer lag time relative to the preceding sampling. there were high proportions of samples positive for RVA in the farrowing area and for RVA and RVC in the nursery area. there was no history of clinical problems due to rotavirus on this farm prior to this case report. genetically diverse strains of RVA have been identified in different age groups of pigs and even between suckling piglets and their dam within a pig herd. this emergence of genetically diverse strains of RVA within a herd may lead to subsequent diarrheal outbreaks in suckling pigs (10). piglet diarrhea persisted in the piglets. this led to a presumptive diagnosis that PEDV had been successfully controlled on the farm."}
