{"summary": "the spike (S) protein, known as S1, is responsible for attachment to host cells. the C-terminal part mediates virus fusion to host cells postattachment. the protein comprises four individually folded domains, designated S1A through S1D (2, 3) the localization of 2,3-sialic acids in the respiratory tract of both humans and dromedary camels has been mapped using lectin histochemistry (5). it is important to note that MERS-CoV S1A preferentially binds to short, sulfated, 2,3-linked monosialosaccharides and long, branched, di- and triantenary 2,3-linked sialic acids. these glycotopes were previously identified by glycan array analysis using nanoparticles displaying multivalent MERS-CoV S1A (5). using these nanoparticles, we developed a histochemistry-based technique to map these glycotopes in the tissues of different susceptible species. np-S1A binds specifically to the nasal epithelium of dromedary camels. these glycotopes are expressed in clusters of ciliated and goblet cells in the nasal epithelium in a random multifocal pattern. np-S1A binding is inhibited by prior neuraminidase treatment of these tissues. blet cells (arrows) are negative, unlike nasal ciliated columnar epithelial cells. np-S1A binding is abrogated by a nanobody against the S1A domain. the control nanobody does not bind to S1, S1A, and S1B. the control nanobody (29) was negative in all three ELISAs. each of the anti-S1A and anti-S1B nanobodies reacted specifically to its domain and to S1 in a dose-dependent manner. the identified S1A nanobody inhibited np-S1A binding to nasal epithelial cells, whereas the S1B-reactive nanobody did not. using lectin histochemistry revealed that the nasal epithelium of pigs does not express these sialic acids. unlike dromedary camels, both species do not express these glycotopes. the absence of these glycotopes in the nasal epithelium of rabbits further supports the fine specificity of A domain binding. MERS-CoV S1A binds specifically to the intestinal epithelium of pipistrelle bats. DPP4 has mediate MERS-CoV infection in various bat cell lines. it also mediate entry of pseudotyped viruses expressing spike proteins of two MERS-CoV-like viruses. np-S1A binds to the apical surface of the intestinal epithelium of common pipistrelle bats in both villi and crypts. in other bat species, it mostly binds to intestinal epithelial cells within the crypts. both bronchiolar epithelial cells and type II pneumocytes express 2,3-sialic acids (26) both cell types also express MERS-CoV-recognized glycotopes. the function of MERS-CoV-recognized glycotopes as an attachment factor has been observed only in Calu3 cells. neuraminidase treatment of vero cells did not express MERS-CoV-recognized glycotopes. primary well-differentiated normal human bronchiolar epithelial cells also express DPP4 and MERS-CoV-recognized glycotopes. removal of sialic acids using neuraminidase (NA) treatment diminishes MERS-CoV S1A binding to primary normal human bronchial epithelial cells but not DPP4 expression in these cells. same treatment significantly inhibits MERS-CoV infection in these cells up to 50%. np-S1A binds specifically to the nasal epithelium of dromedary camels. these glycotopes are expressed in clusters of ciliated and goblet cells. np-S1A binding is inhibited by prior neuraminidase treatment of these nasal tissues. np-S1A binding is abrogated by a nanobody against the S1A domain (Nb anti-S1A) but not against the S1B domain (Nb anti-S1B) the control nanobody does not bind to S1, S1A, and S1B. the control nanobody (29) was negative in all three ELISAs. each of the anti-S1A and anti-S1B nanobodies reacted specifically to its corresponding domain and to S1 in a dose-dependent manner. the identified S1A nanobody inhibited np-S1A binding to nasal epithelial cells. of 2,3-sialic acids in these tissues using lectin histochemistry. we then used np-S1A to test for the presence of MERS-CoV-recognized glycotopes in the nasal epithelium of pigs and rabbits. the absence of these glycotopes in the nasal epithelium of rabbits further supports the fine specificity of A domain binding. MERS-CoV S1A binds specifically to the intestinal epithelium of pipistrelle bats. DPP4 has mediate MERS-CoV infection in various bat cell lines. it has also mediate entry of pseudotyped viruses expressing spike proteins of two MERS-CoV-like viruses. np-S1A binds to the apical surface of the intestinal epithelium of common pipistrelle bats in both villi and crypts. in others, np-S1A binds only to the intestinal crypts. our lectin histochemistry staining showed that both bronchiolar epithelial cells and type II pneumocytes express 2,3-sialic acids. both cell types also express MERS-CoV-recognized glycotopes. the function of MERS-CoV-recognized glycotopes as an attachment factor. neuraminidase treatment of vero cells, which do not express MERS-CoV-recognized glycotopes, had no effect on the number of infected cells. primary well-differentiated normal human bronchiolar epithelial cells also express DPP4 and MERS-CoV-recognized glycotopes. removal of sialic acids using neuraminidase (NA) treatment diminishes MERS-CoV S1A binding to primary normal human bronchial epithelial cells. same treatment also significantly inhibits MERS-CoV infection in these cells up to 50%. MERS-CoV preferentially binds 2,3-linked sialic acids via its S1A domain and uses these sialic acids as an attachment factor. previous studies have shown that MERS-CoV-inoculated pigs and rabbits shed less infectious virus than did dromedary camels (6, 7, 10, 11, 27) MERS-CoV has been reported to use host cell proteases to mediate fusion to host cells (54\u201356) the virus has been shown to be sensitive to type I interferon, an essential host innate immune cytokine (5, 54\u201358) absence of these proteases and presence of an inhibiting host innate immune response could effectively limit MERS-CoV replication and transmission. 2,3-sialic acid glycotopes recognized by MERS-CoV S1A vary. these glycotopes and DPP4 are expressed in the nasal ciliated epithelial cells of dromedary camels, type II pneumocytes of humans, and intestinal epithelial cells of common pipistrelle bats. this study corroborates 2,3-sialic acid glycotopes as an important attachment factor for MERS-CoV 107 tissue culture infectious doses (TCID50) were inoculated with cell culture medium. rabbits were inoculated with 106 TCID50 via the intranasal route. infected animals were sacrificed at day 4 postinoculation (6, 7, 27) the tissues were boiled in 10 mM citric acid buffer (pH 6) for 15 min and blocked with 5% normal goat serum (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) before staining with 3 g/ml np-S1A overnight at 4\u00b0C. anti-S1A, anti-S1B, or control nanobodies were incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. these tissues were stained with rabbit anti-Strep-tag sera generated in-house and goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) each at a 1:100 dilution, for 1 h at room temperature and then visualized with 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole. plates were washed three times in PBST, a 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine substrate (eBioscience) was added, and the plates were incubated for 10 min. the reaction was stopped with 0.5 N H2SO4 (Sigma) each well was inoculated with the MERS-CoV EMC/2012 strain (6, 7) at 106 TCID50/ml. each well was incubated for 36 h and fixed in 10% formalin. each well was visualized with 5 g/ml mouse anti-MERS nucleoprotein. dromedary camels and pigs were inoculated via the intranasal route. rabbits were inoculated with 106 TCID50 and 4 106 TCID50 via the intratracheal route. infected animals were sacrificed at day 4 postinoculation (6, 7, 27) incubated in 3% H2O2 for 10 min and in 5% normal goat serum for 30 min. staining was performed by deparaffinizing and hydrating the tissue slides. subsequently incubating them in a periodic acid solution for 5 min and Schiff\u2019s reagent for 15 min. neuraminidase was pretreated with 800 mU/ml neuraminidase from Vibrio cholerae (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 4 h at 37\u00b0C. additional controls were performed by staining tissues with np-S1A previously incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C with either anti-S1A, anti-S1B, or control nanobodies at a 15- amino acids 1 to 357), or S1B (amino acids 358 to 588) protein in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. wells were then washed with PBS and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS\u20130.5% Tween 20 for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. plates were washed three times in PBST, followed by goat anti-mouse each well was inoculated with the MERS-CoV EMC/2012 strain (6, 7) at 106 TCID50/ml (multiplicity of infection [MOI] of 5), incubated for 36 h, and fixed in 10% formalin."}
