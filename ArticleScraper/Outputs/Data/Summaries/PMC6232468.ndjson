{"summary": "coinfections are common causes of both upper and lower respiratory tract infections across all age groups (4, 8\u201310). coinfection by influenza viruses has been found to reduce the severity of rhinovirus infection (13), and coinfection by respiratory syncytial virus enhances disease compared to that caused by rhinovirus alone. influenza viruses and rhinoviruses were detected as copathogens less frequently than would be expected based on their detection rates within the population. this was also true for other virus pairs, including rhinovirus with adenovirus and coronavirus with respiratory syncytial virus. rhinovirus RV1B (RV) reduced the pathogenesis of influenza A virus PR8 infection. the severity of PR8 infection and the timing of coinfection were critical determinants of disease attenuation. RESULTS RV infection 2 days before PR8 lessens disease severity in mice. mice inoculated with RV and mock inoculated (RV/Mock) or mock inoculated and inoculated with PR8 (Mock/PR8) were monitored daily for mortality and weight loss. humane endpoints included loss of more than 25% of their starting weight. mice inoculated with RV had no distinguishable differences in weight loss or clinical signs from mice that received mock inoculations. mice were either mock inoculated or inoculated with PR8 at 100 (PR8Low) (A to C), 200 (PR8Med) (D to F) or 7.5 103 (PR8Hi) (G to I) TCID50 units. mice were monitored for mortality (A, D, and G), weight loss (B, E, and H), and clinical signs of disease (C, F, and I), including lethargy, ruffled fur, hun all mice inoculated with PR8Med alone succumbed to infection, whereas two of the seven coinfected mice survived. both groups of mice, Mock/PR8Med and RV/PR8Med, began losing weight on day 3. mice inoculated with PR8Med had milder clinical signs throughout PR8 infection. coinfection by RV leads to rapid clearance of PR8 from the lungs. groups of mice were either mock inoculated or inoculated with RV 2 days before inoculation. mice were either mock inoculated or inoculated with RV 2 days before inoculation. on day 2, mice were inoculated with 100 TCID50 units of PR8. titrated by TCID50 assay of homogenized lungs. data for individual mice shown with the geometric mean standard deviation indicated for each group. the lack of PR8 antigen staining in lung sections from mock-inoculated mice confirmed the specificity of staining. on day 4, both single-virus- and coinfected groups had extensive infection of the tracheal and bronchial epithelium. both groups had focal viral antigen staining in the alveoli, with antigen detected in pneumocytes and immune cells by day 7 suggesting clearance of infection. Lung tissues were collected on day 4 (B) and day 7 (C) after PR8 inoculation. images were representative of two sections from two animals per group and time point. examples of antigen in epithelial cells, antigen in leukocytes and mucopurulent material are indicated. coinfection stimulated an early yet controlled inflammatory response to PR8 infection. compared to mock-inoculated controls, both Mock/PR8- and RV/PR8-infected mice had multifocal tracheobronchitis and bronchioalveolitis. inflammation was associated with dilated and congested blood capillaries. inflammation was associated with extravasation of blood plasma, hemorrhage, thickened alveolar septae, collapsed alveoli, and enlarged alveolar ducts observed in severe lesions. the right lung\u2019s caval lobe appeared to be commonly more inflamed than other lobes. bronchioles (B), terminal bronchioles (T), respiratory bronchioles (R), normal alveoli (An), inflamed alveoli (An), and blood vessels (V) by day 4, lung pathology was more extensive in RV/PR8-coinfected mice than in Mock/PR8-infected mice. however, by days 7 and 10, mice infected with Mock/PR8 had more severe lung pathology. the results of this analysis are summarized in Fig. 5B. fewer inflammatory cells in the alveoli in lungs of RV/PR8-coinfected mice compared with lungs of Mock/PR8-infected mice. coinfection by RV reduced the magnitude of the inflammatory response to PR8 infection. RV+PR8Low-coinfected mice reached 33% mortality by day 9. this mortality was higher than mice inoculated with RV 2 days before PR8Low (RV/PR8Low) but significantly lower than the 100% mortality seen with mice infected with PR8Low alone. mice were either mock inoculated or inoculated with 7.6 106 TCID50 units of RV 2 days before (RV/PR8), simultaneously with (RV+PR8) or 2 days after (PR8/RV) inoculation with 100 (PR8Low) or 200 (PR8Med) TCID50 units of PR8. mice were monitored for mortality, weight loss, and clinical signs of disease. RV+PR8Med-coinfected mice had slightly lower clinical scores than Mock/PR8Med-infected mice. however, differences in clinical signs did not affect mortality. all mice reached humane endpoints by day 7 1 day earlier than mice inoculated with Mock/PR8Med. MHV2000/PR8-coinfected mice regained weight at a rate lower than that of mice inoculated with MHV2000/Mock. however, coinfection by MHV reduced the severity of PR8-induced disease, but this dose of MHV caused significant morbidity in mice. mice were monitored for mortality, weight loss, and clinical signs of disease. mice were inoculated with a twofold-lower dose of MHV (MHV1000/Mock) there was no mortality associated with infection. MHV1000/Mock-infected mice lost weight very early in infection. mortality was delayed until day 8 compared to day 5 for the higher dose. mice that were coinfected with this low dose of MHV prior to PR8 (MHV200/PR8) had significant mortality, weight loss, and prolonged clinical signs of disease. however, this lowest dose of MHV caused minimal disease in BALB/c mice, but it was not as effective at reducing PR8-induced morbidity and mortality. this data suggest that a dose of MHV that causes significant morbidity is required to effectively protect against a lethal dose of influenza A virus PR8 MHV/PR8-infected groups had significantly increased IFN- expression compared to Mock/PR8-infected mice on day 2. MHV induces early upregulation of IFN- that corresponds with reduced PR8 replication on day 2. however, the upregulation of IFN- and reduction in PR8 replication was not sustained. mice inoculated with RV, followed 2 days later by a low, medium, or high dose of PR8 (PR8Low, PR8Med, or PR8Hi, respectively) mice inoculated with RV and mock inoculated (RV/Mock) or mock inoculated and inoculated with PR8 (Mock/PR8) on day 2/day 0. mice were monitored daily for mortality and weight loss and given a score based on clinical signs of disease. coinfected mice lost weight between days 3 to 7, but the rate of loss and maximum weight loss were less than for mice infected by PR8Low alone. clinical signs in coinfected mice were limited to minor ruffling and hunching, and the onset of these signs was delayed until day 5 compared to mice infected with a low dose of PR8 alone. mice were either mock inoculated or inoculated with PR8 at 100 (PR8Low) (A mice inoculated with a medium dose of PR8 (Mock/PR8Med) had increased mortality, weight loss, and clinical signs compared to mice inoculated with Mock/PR8Low. disease severity was only partially reduced by coinfection with RV (RV/PR8Med), whereas two of the seven coinfected mice survived. coinfected mice (RV/PR8Hi) had no differences in mortality (Fig. 1G), weight loss (Fig. 1H) or clinical signs (Fig. 1I) compared to Mock/PR8Hi-infected mice. coinfection by RV leads to rapid clearance of PR8 from the lungs. mice were mock inoculated or coinfected with 7.6 106 TCID50 units of PR8. mice were either mock inoculated or inoculated with 7.6 106 TCID50 units of RV on day 2. data for individual mice are shown with the geometric mean standard deviation indicated for each group. IFN- expression was not significantly upregulated compared to mock inoculation on day 2. however, there was a trend toward reduced IFN- in coinfected mice on days 4 and 6. the lack of PR8 antigen staining in lung sections confirmed the specificity of staining. images taken of the indicated regions of the lungs show mice given mock inoculations on days 2 and 0 (A) and mice given Mock/PR8 or RV/PR8 on day 2/day 0 (B and C) Tissue sections were immunostained for the PR8 hemagglutinin protein, which was visualized by ImmPACT Vector red. images were representative of two sections from two animals per group and time point. the lower PR8 titers at 96 h may have been due to higher cell death from two viruses being present, providing fewer susceptible cells for PR8 replication. this trend was also seen when cells were inoculated with both viruses simultaneously (Fig. 4A to). this trend was also seen when cells were inoculated with both viruses simultaneously. epithelial degeneration, necrosis, and accumulation of neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes in the inflamed areas. this was associated with the accumulation of mucopurulent discharge in the bronchioles and alveoli. inflammation was associated with dilated and congested blood capillaries with extravasation of blood plasma. bronchioles (B), terminal bronchioles (T), respiratory bronchioles (R), normal alveoli (An), inflamed alveoli (Ai) and blood vessels (V) by day 4, lung pathology was more extensive in RV/PR8-coinfected mice than in Mock/PR8-infected mice. pleurisy was present only in the lungs of Mock/PR8-infected mice. /PR8-coinfected mice had more lymphocytes and macrophages and fewer neutrophils than the lungs of Mock/PR8-infected mice. the findings suggest that Mock/PR8-coinfected mice had more tissue damage and exacerbated inflammation. the findings suggest that Mock/PR8-coinfected mice had more tissue damage and exacerbated inflammation. coinfection with RV resulted in a disease phenotype intermediate between PR8Low and PR8Low. this mortality was higher than mice inoculated with RV 2 days before PR8Low (RV/PR8Low) but significantly lower than the 100% mortality seen with mice infected with PR8Low alone (Mock/PR8Low) mice inoculated with Mock/PR8Low/RV-coinfected mice also lost weight at a greater rate. increased clinical scores were due to severe lethargy and ruffling, moderate hunching, and labored breathing. mice were monitored for mortality, weight loss, and clinical signs of disease. RV was effective at disease attenuation only when given 2 days before a higher dose (PR8Med) of PR8. no significant differences in mortality, weight loss, or clinical signs between simultaneously coinfected (RV+PR8Med) mice and mice inoculated with PR8Med alone. MHV-infected mice (MHV2000/Mock) had rapid, early weight loss followed by gradual recovery of weight. mice had moderate ruffling and hunching early in infection, which decreased to slight ruffling, lethargy, and hunching before the mice finally recovered on day 13. mortality and morbidity of mice coinfected with a lethal dose of PR8 were similar to mortality and morbidity of mice infected by MHV alone MHV1000 and PR8 coinfection mortality (D), weight loss (E), and clinical scores (F) were compared by multiple Student\u2019s t tests with Holm-Sidak multiple-comparison correction. survival curves were compared by using log rank Mantel-Cox curve comparison. coinfected mice were coinfected with a 10-fold-lower dose of MHV. they all survived and had minimal weight loss and clinical signs of disease. a dose of MHV that causes significant morbidity is required to protect against a lethal dose of influenza A virus PR8. titers were equivalent in mice infected with MHV alone or MHV/PR8-coinfected mice on day 2. MHV/Mock- and MHV/PR8-infected groups had significantly increased IFN- expression compared to Mock/PR8-infected mice on day 2. this data demonstrate that MHV induces early upregulation of IFN- that corresponds with reduced PR8 replication on day 2. mice given RV 2 days before influenza A virus PR8 were completely protected against mortality. a respiratory tropic strain of MHV also reduced PR8 disease when given 2 days before PR8. infection of mice with RV 2 days before PR8 did not reduce PR8 levels in the lungs early in infection or prevent spread of PR8 within the respiratory tract. treatment of mice with a live attenuated vaccine strain of Bordetella pertussis or toll-like receptor agonists prior to IAV reduces the severity of IAV infection without affecting viral titers in the lungs. RV/PR8-infected mice had increased IFN- expression early in coinfection (day 2). this was not sufficient to reduce PR8 replication in the lungs at early time points. IFNs are important for the recruitment and functional phenotypes of myeloid cell responses to influenza virus infections. newtrophil levels in the airways of RV-infected mice peak on days 1 and 2. lymphocytes are present through day 7 (29, 40, 41, 44, 45) studies differ in whether macrophage numbers change. RV infection actively downregulates neutrophil responses by inhibiting TLR signaling and thereby reducing expression of neutrophil-specific chemokines upon coinfection by a bacterial pathogen (50). the inflamed areas of the RV/PR8-coinfected lungs contained fewer neutrophils than Mock/PR8-infected lungs. the importance of infection order is also seen in virus/bacterium coinfection systems. bacteria secondary to IAV have been widely shown to have worse disease outcomes than either IAV or the bacterial infection alone. however, when these same bacterial pathogens are given to mice prior to PR8, they can reduce the severity of IAV (56, 58) reducing the dose of MHV to lessen disease resulted in less efficient protection upon coinfection with PR8. however, reducing the dose of MHV to lessen disease resulted in less efficient protection upon coinfection with PR8. Interestingly, coinfected mice had lower PR8 loads in the lungs on day 2 than Mock/PR8-infected mice. MHV and RV induced earlier IFN- expression in coinfected mice. this response was associated with lower PR8 titers only in MHV/PR8-coinfected mice. this may be due to higher level of IFN- expression in MHV/PR8-coinfected mice. a dsRNA mimic protects mice from a number of IAV strains. protection is at least partly independent of TLR3, suggesting other dsRNA receptors, such as MDA5 and RIG-I may also promote protection. MHV has mechanisms that prevent activation of IFN responses during viral replication in cells. mice were given lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) or PR8 6 weeks prior to vaccinia virus had reduced titers of vaccinia virus compared to those of control mice. pigs were infected with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus. influenza A virus PR8 (A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 [H1N1]) was grown and titrated by 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) assay in 17Cl.1 cells. mouse hepatitis virus MHV-1 (ATCC VR-261) was grown and titrated by plaque assay in 17Cl.1 cells. control mice received mock inoculations of the same buffer or medium used for the respective virus: RV (PBS/2% FBS), PR8 (DMEM/1% bovine serum albumin [BSA]), or MHV (DMEM/10% FBS). mice were humanely euthanized if they lost more than 25% of their starting weight or exhibited severe clinical signs of disease. mock-inoculated mice were calculated using the 2Ct method (84) tracheas of euthanized mice were cannulated, and the lungs were inflated with 10% formalin before submerging the lungs in 10% formalin. lungs were embedded in paraffin, cut in 5-m sections, stained with modified Harris hematoxylin and eosin. bronchiolar epithelium, alveolar epithelium, and leukocytes were inoculated with PR8 (multiplicity of infection [MOI] of 1). cells were washed twice with serum-free medium and then incubated in Ham\u2019s F12K medium with 2% FBS and antibiotics at 37\u00b0C. survival curves were compared using log rank Mantel-Cox curve comparison. ine lung epithelial cells (LA-4) (ATCC CL-196) were grown in Ham\u2019s F12 (Kaign\u2019s modified) medium (F12K; Caisson) supplemented with 10% to 15% FBS and antibiotics. influenza A virus PR8 (A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 [H1N1]) was grown and titrated by 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) assay in MDCK cells. mice received mock inoculations of the same buffer or medium used for the respective virus: RV (PBS/2% FBS), PR8 (DMEM/1% bovine serum albumin [BSA]), or MHV (DMEM/10% FBS). mice were weighed and observed for clinical signs of disease daily and were humanely euthanized if they lost more than 25% of their starting weight or exhibited severe clinical signs of disease. tracheas of euthanized mice were cannulated, and lungs were inflated with 10% formalin before submerging the lungs in 10% formalin. lungs were embedded in paraffin, cut in 5-m sections, and stained with modified Harris hematoxylin and eosin. d areas were calculated by the ratio of inflamed area over total tissue area analyzed. bronchiolar epithelium, alveolar epithelium, and leukocytes were measured."}
