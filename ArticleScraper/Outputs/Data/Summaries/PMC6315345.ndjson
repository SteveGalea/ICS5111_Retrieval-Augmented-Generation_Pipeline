{"summary": "dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius, also known as Arabian camel) as direct sources and bats as potential reservoirs. MERS-CoV has caused 2254 laboratory-confirmed human cases, including 800 deaths in 27 countries. a single positive-stranded RNA virus of about 30 kb encodes four viral structural proteins. the S protein (1353 aa) plays an important role in virus infection. the S protein (1353 aa) plays an important role in virus infection. 4C2 and 2E6 Stable hybridoma cell lines were generated by fusing myeloma cells with splenocytes of mice that were immunized with MERS-RBD protein. two neutralizing mAbs, 4C2 and 2E6, had high affinity for the RBD of MERS-CoV. humanized 4C2 showed similar neutralizing activity in cell entry tests. splenocytes of mice that were immunized with recombinant MERS-CoV S1 were critical for Mersmab1 binding to the RBD. splenocytes of mice that were immunized with recombinant MERS-CoV S1 were critical for Mersmab1 binding to the RBD. the 4C2 complex interfered with MERS-CoV binding to DPP4 by both steric hindrance and interface-residue competition. 2E6 competed with 4C2 to bind to MERS-RBD, indicating that they recognized proximate or overlapping epitopes. seven human neutralizing mAbs with varying neutralization efficacy to MERS-CoV were identified [12] with a unique spanning strategy. the epitopes of these mAbs lay within aa 349\u2013590 of the S protein. these mAbs recognized at least three distinct epitope groups. m336 neutralized both pseudovirus and live MERS-CoV infectivity. m336 inhibited 90% MERS-CoV pseudovirus infection at a concentration of 0.039 g/mL. m336 also neutralized live MERS-CoV with IC95 of 1 g/mL. administration of LCA60 reduced MERS-CoV titer in the lungs of these mice more effectively. cross-competition experiment demonstrated that LCA60 competed with 3B11 to bind to the RBD. two fully human neutralizing mAbs, REGN3051 and REGN3048, were obtained [21]. the two mAbs bound with high affinity to distinct epitopes on the RBD of MERS-CoV. structure analysis of the MCA1 Fab-RBD complex showed that MCA1 formed direct contacts with the receptor-binding site (RBS) subdomain on the RBD. superimposed structure analysis of MCA1-RBD and hDPP4-RBD complexes showed that the binding interface of MCA1 was largely overlapped with that of hDPP4. MERS-4 bound to unique epitopes and caused conformational changes in the RBD interface critical for accommodating DPP4. the special neutralizing mechanism made MERS-4 a valuable addition for the combined use of mAbs against MERS-CoV infection. seven human neutralizing mAbs with varying neutralization efficacy to MERS-CoV were identified [12] with a unique spanning strategy. the epitopes of these mAbs lay within aa 349\u2013590 of the S protein. these mAbs recognized at least three distinct epitope groups. m336 neutralized both pseudovirus and live MERS-CoV infectivity. of the three mAbs, m336 neutralized both pseudovirus and live MERS-CoV infectivity. m336 also neutralized live MERS-CoV infectivity. LCA60 effectively neutralizes MERS-CoV infectivity in cells. in vivo study showed that LCA60 provided mice transduced with adenoviral vectors expressing human DPP4. two fully human neutralizing mAbs, REGN3051 and REGN3048, were obtained [21]. the two mAbs bound with high affinity to distinct epitopes on the RBD of MERS-CoV were conserved during the natural evolution of MERS-CoV. MCA1 showed potent neutralizing activity against MERS-CoV in cell entry tests. in vivo, MCA1 completely inhibited the replication of MERS-CoV in common marmosets when administrated prophylactically or therapeutically. MERS-4 bound to the RBD with about 45-fold higher affinity than DPP4. primary neutralizing mechanism was blocking binding of the RBD to DPP4. MERS-4 also demonstrated synergistic effects with m336 and 5F9. residues L506, D509, V534, E536, and A556 on RBD were important for the neutralizing activity of MERS-GD27. in vivo study found that MERS-GD27 could provide both prophylactic and therapeutic protection for hDPP4-trangenic mice against MERS-CoV infection. VHH-83 effectively blocked the entry of MERS-CoV into cells. chimeric camel/human HCAb-83 was highly stable in mice. chimeric camel/human HCAb-83 showed similar neutralizing activity as VHH-83. psuedotyped MERS-CoV bearing a mutation in D539 was critical for NbMS10 binding. NbMS10 effectively neutralized the cell entry of live MERS-CoV. hDPP4-transgenic mice were protected against MERS-CoV infection. chimeric camel/human HCAb-83 was highly stable in mice. a neutralizing Nb, NbMS10, which bound with high affinity to the RBD of MERS-CoV and blocked the binding of RBD to DPP4, was identified. the binding site of the NbMS10 on the RBD overlapped with that of DPP4. single neutralizing antibody bears the risk of selecting escape mutants. most of these escape mutations had little impact on viral fitness. mutants of MERS-CoV during natural infection have also been reported. the in vitro neutralizing potency of 5F9 was approximately 10-fold lower than that of the RBD-targeting neutralizing mAbs [40], it may provide an alternative for the immunotherapy against MERS-CoV. commonly-used laboratory animals\u2014such as wild-type mouse, ferret, hamster, and guinea pig\u2014are not susceptible to MERS-CoV infection due to differences in critical amino acids in the S-binding domain of their DPP4. efficacy."}
