{"summary": "monocytes and macrophages play important roles in pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), therapeutic strategies aim to counteract macrophage homing, activation and differentiation. Activated macrophages are important sources of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) because of this, macrophages are the primary effector of tissue destruction, and they participate in the degradation of both normal and abnormal matrix [ CD147 undergoes extensive post-translational processing and exhibits remarkable variations in its size. the highly glycosylated, high molecular weight forms induce MMP production, whereas the lowly glycosylated, low molecular weight forms have been shown to inhibit MMP function. statins block the formation of cholesterol biosynthesis pathway intermediates such as isoprenoids and dolichol. lower levels of N-glycosylation result in accumulation of immature forms of these proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. statins inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase-mediated formation of mevalonate, which is the rate-limiting step of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. mevalonate, squalene, and water-soluble cholesterol (Sigma) were used at a final concentration of 100 M. farnesylpyrophosphate (FPP), geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP; Sigma) and dolichol (Larodan, Malm\u00f6, Sweden) were all used at 10 M. cell culture All experiments were performed in the human monocytic cell line THP-1 [8,11] cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% FCS (Gibco BRL, Gaithersburg, MD), 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 2% L-glutamine (Gibco) at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere. CD147 immunoblotting cells were preincubated with statins or controls. cells were then lysed in 1 ml RIPA buffer supplemented with sodium orthovandate (Sigma) and a complete protease inhibitor cocktail. the proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a PVDF membrane. positive controls for MMP-2 and -9 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) were added to each gel. the gels were stained with 0.5% Coomassie blue (Sigma) and destained in a buffer consisting of 10% acetic acid, 50% methanol and 40% distilled water. an image of each gel was scanned after drying. a p-value of 0.05 was accepted to be significant. Reagents Fluvastatin (Novartis, N\u00fcrnberg, Germany) and atorvastatin (Pfizer, Karlsruhe, Germany) were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and used at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 10 M. allophycyanin (APC)-labeled anti-CD14 monoclonal antibody (MP9, IgG2b; Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) was used for flow cytometry. anti-CD147 monoclonal antibody (MEM 6/1, IgG1; Immunotools) was also used for immunoblotting. anti-human FITC-labeled anti-CD147 monoclonal antibody (clone MEM 6/1, mouse IgG1; Immunotools, Friesoythe, Germany) and an allophycyanin-labeled anti-CD14 monoclonal antibody (MP9, IgG2b; Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) were used for flow cytometry. cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented cell permeabilization assay THP-1 cells were incubated with statins or controls and differentiated with PMA to upregulate CD147. cells were simultaneously permeabilized and fixed in cell permeabilization buffer containing paraformaldehyde. supernatants were collected after incubation with statins or controls. ten l of supernatant was mixed with 10 l SDS loading buffer. positive controls for MMP-2 and -9 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) were added. cells were lysed using lysis buffer containing 10% SDS, 0.4 M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.1 M benzamidine. the biotinylated proteins were pulled down with beads and eluted in SDS Laemmli buffer for immunoblotting. differentiation of nave THP-1 cells with PMA resulted in a change in morphology, with cells becoming flat, elongated, amoeboid and adherent. pravastatin treatment resulted in a cellular morphology similar to that of undifferentiated THP-1 cells. cellular morphology was assessed by light microscopy at 50x magnification. numbers represent percentage of THP-1 cells with adherent, amoeboid morphology indicating differentiation. treatment with mevalonate reversed the effect of fluvastatin and resulted in a differentiated cellular morphology. inhibition of CD147 expression followed by FTI-277 and GGTI-298. expression of the monocytic differentiation antigen CD14 is regulated in a manner similar to that of CD147. dolichol (Fig 4C) and FPP (Fig 4D) almost completely rescued the differentiation of THP-1 cells. GGPP failed to do so (Fig 4E) results show that in PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells, most of the CD147 molecules were expressed on the cell surface. fluvastatin induced intracellular retention of CD147. this effect was mimicked by tunicamycin treatment. treatment of THP-1 cells with fluvastatin induced LG CD147 expression in a dose-dependent manner. inhibition of isoprenylation by GGTI-298 or FPT1 increased LG CD147. treatment with AP-9, a specific peptide antagonist of CD147, increased LG CD147. p 0.05, compared with PMA-differentiated cells whose value was set as 1.0. cell surface levels of HG-CD147 were markedly downregulated after treatment with any of the three statins. the value of the band intensity of PMA-differentiated cells was set as 1.0. the value of the band intensity of PMA-differentiated cells was set as 1.0. pravastatin and atorvastatin failed to do so. TI-277 and GGTI-298 inhibited the expression of active MMP-9. supernatants were collected and analyzed for MMP digestion activity. p 0.05, fluvastatin plus rescue compounds compared with fluvastatin. pravastatin reduced active MMP-2 levels, whereas pravastatin and atorvastatin did not. dolichol and mevalonate treatment rescued active MMP-2. cellular morphology was assessed by light microscopy at 50x magnification. treatment with mevalonate reversed the effect of fluvastatin and resulted in a differentiated cellular morphology. statin treatment inhibits expression of CD147 and CD14 on PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that the surface expression of CD147 was upregulated in PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells. treatment with pravastatin, atorvastatin or fluvastatin resulted in downregulation. fluvastatin (FS) and fluvastatin-treated cells rescued with farnesylpyrophosphate (GGPP) experiments were conducted in triplicate; one representative result is shown. expression of the monocytic differentiation antigen CD14 is regulated in a manner similar to that of CD147; therefore monitored the expression of CD14 along with CD147. FS-treated cells rescued with (C) dolichol (DOL), (D) farnesylpyrophosphate (FPP) or (E) geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP) experiments were conducted in triplicate; one representative result is shown. statins induce lowly glycosylated forms of CD147 CD147 exists in two different glycosylated forms. HG CD147 forms homo-oligomers and induces MMP secretion and activation, whereas LG CD147 inhibits MMP secretion. treatment of THP-1 cells with fluvastatin induced LG CD147 expression in a dose-dependent manner. total cell lysates were subjected to immunoblotting to assess the glycosylation status of CD147. alpha tubulin served as a loading control for the immunoblots. both HG-CD147 and LG-CD147 were detected in the cell lysate. levels of biotinylated cell surface proteins were compared with cellular total protein levels (in whole cell lysates) mevalonate, FPP, GGPP, or dolichol were able to increase the levels of activated MMP-9. tunicamycin, FTI-277 and GGTI-298 inhibited the expression of active MMP-9. active MMP-2 exists in two forms, a pro-form (72 kDa) and an active form (62 kDa) fluvastatin reduced active MMP-2 levels, while pravastatin and atorvastatin did not. statins inhibit all of the elements of this macrophage differentiation process, retaining THP-1 cells in a dormant state. possible molecular mechanisms described so far include: inhibition of isoprenylation of GTP-binding proteins produced through the farnesylation and/or the geranylgeranylation pathway. monocytes migrate from peripheral compartments to target organs where they mature. this maturation process results in the release of several inflammatory cytokines. AP-9, a specific peptide antagonist of CD147, prevents monocyte differentiation. statins inhibited differentiation of monocytes and inhibit MMP secretion and activation. statin treatment also altered the morphology of THP-1 cells. the extracellular domain of CD147 has three putative N-linked glycosylation sites. isoprenylation, N-glycosylation or intracellular retention of immature pro-forms of CD147 contribute to the expression and activity of CD147. statins regulate CD147 on multiple levels, particularly through isoprenylation. most transmembrane proteins are not as sensitive to changes in glycosylation status as CD147. the requirement for high levels of glycosylation for the MMP stimulating activity of CD147 [18] is unusual but not unique. two groups have described downregulation of IGF-1 receptor by statin treatment. in monocytes, statins have been shown to inhibit proinflammatory responses [52], abort the functional differentiation of monocytes and inhibit MMP secretion and activation [53] statins inhibited the differentiation of THP-1 cells, which was evidenced by decreases in adherence. statin-induced inhibition of CD147 expression was more pronounced at the cell surface compared to the intracellular compartment. we hypothesized that statins regulate expression of CD147 through post-translational mechanisms, e.g., isoprenylation, N-glycosylation or intracellular retention of immature pro-forms of CD147, rather than changes at the genomic level. statins regulate CD147 on multiple levels, particularly through isoprenylation and N-glycosylation. most transmembrane proteins are not as sensitive to changes in glycosylation status as CD147. statins inhibit upregulation of CD147 observed during monocytic differentiation. statins produce anti-inflammatory effects on monocytes and macrophages. statins are already widely used for primary prevention of atherosclerosis."}
