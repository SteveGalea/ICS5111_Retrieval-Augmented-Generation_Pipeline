{"summary": "this work describes the development of a synthetic oligo-cassette for positive controls for accurate and highly sensitive diagnosis of several mutations relevant to influenza virus drug resistance. results Using synthetic paired long oligonucleotides containing complementary sequences at their 3' ends, we generated 170bp dsDNA containing several known specific neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) resistance mutations. strains with altered susceptibility to the NAI have been recovered from approximately 1% of immunocompetent adult patients [6] and up to 18% of pediatric patients [7] oseltamivir-resistant influenza A H5N1 and pandemic H1N1 2009 viruses with the H274Y mutation have been reported from patients during oseltamivir treatment [8,9] significant advances in molecular biology and human genomic research has paved the way for a host of new in the event of an influenza pandemic, drug resistant strains and their transmission could be clinically highly significant. oligonucleotide dimers between two commercially synthesised long single stranded DNA templates generate 170 bp double-stranded artificial DNA templates. this is a more molecularly feasible and durable way to synthesize even longer double stranded DNA templates. PCR products from each oligo were cloned and 5 positive clones were sequenced to validate the presence of desired mutations. each sequence was aligned carefully and compared with the artificial template design.
