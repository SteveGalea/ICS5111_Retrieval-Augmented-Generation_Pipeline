{"summary": "Inoculation of susceptible mice with the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHM) into the CNS results in widespread dissemination of virus, leading to infection and replication within glial cells. chemokines and chemokines are secreted by inflammatory leukocytes and resident cells of the CNS, generating an inflammatory milieu that contributes to host defense. anti-CXCR2 treatment was found to diminish macrophage recruitment to the CNS. other studies have demonstrated that neutrophil depletion in mice in which monocyte trafficking to the CNS is compromised does not alter early CNS inflammation, clinical disease severity, or death. pBI-CXCL1 transgenic (tg) mice were generated by the university of California, Irvine tg mouse facility. hemizygous pBI-CXCL1 tgs were crossed to wild-type C57BL/6 mice to indentify F1 offspring containing the transgene. animals were injected with doxycycline (Dox) starting at day 2 postinfection and continuing through day 12 p.i. primary astrocyte cultures Cortices from postnatal day 1 pBI-CXCL1-rtTA (double-tg) and rtTA-GFAP (single-tg) mice were dissected and triturated according to previously published protocols (11) in brief, cortical tissue was minced with a razor and placed in prewarmed DMEM containing papain to completely dissociate the tissue. expression was determined by normalizing expression of each sample to -actin. expression of defined mouse chemokine and cytokine genes within the CNS of experimental mice was determined using a mouse cytokine and chemokine RT2 Profiler PCR array (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) immunophenotyping was performed using either rat anti-mouse IgG or Armenian hamster anti-mouse IgG Abs. mice were euthanized and perfused with 30 ml PBS to remove NaFl from the vasculature. a 1:1 ratio of supernatant was combined with 15% trichlor. fluorescence intensity was assessed with a Synergy H1 (BioTek, Winooski, VT) set at a 485 nm excitation, and NaFl concentrations were determined through extrapolation from a standard curve generated from defined NaFl concentrations. Mice were euthanized and perfused with 30 ml 4% paraformaldehyde. pBI-CXCL1 cDNA was cloned into a pBI-MCS-EGFP plasmid (9) downstream of a bidirectional tetracycline responsive element. pBI-CXCL1 plasmid was linearized following an overnight incubation with AatII and AseI restriction enzymes to generate a 3350-bp fragment containing the pBI-CXCL1 construct. age-matched 5- to 6-wk-old single-tg or double-tg mice were infected intracerebrally (i.c.) with 250 PFU JHMV strain J2.2v-1 in 30 l sterile HBSS. animals were injected with doxycycline (doxycycline) (50 mg/kg via i.p. injection) cDNA from brains and spinal cords of sham- and JHMV-infected mice at days 4, 7 and 12 p.i. was generated via SuperScript III (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) to determine relative CXCL1 mRNA expression, real-time SYBR Green analysis was performed using mouse -actin primers. expression of defined mouse chemokine and cytokine genes within the CNS of experimental mice was determined using a mouse cytokin spinal cords were homogenized in RIPA buffer and clarified by high-speed centrifugation. samples were diluted in RIPA buffer to a standard protein concentration before performing the ELISA assay. Flow cytometry was performed to immunophenotype inflammatory cells entering the CNS using established protocols (3, 13) mice received 100 l 10% sodium fluorescein (NaFl) in PBS via i.p. injection. after 30 min, mice were euthanized and perfused with 30 ml PBS. severity of demyelination for each mouse was determined using 6\u201312 spinal cord coronal sections per mouse using either a previously described four-point scoring scale (14). slides were first desiccated for at least 2 h and blocked with 5% normal donkey serum with or without 0.3% Triton X-100. tg mice were engineered to use the tetracycline-controlled transcriptional activation system in which the human GFAP promoter drove expression of a modified version of the rtTA protein (rtTA*M2). double-tg mice (pBI-CXCL1-rtTA) were generated and genotyped to confirm they incorporated both constructs. the internal control was performed when detecting GFAP-rtTa amplicons. cortex tissue from double-tg and single-tg postnatal day 1 mice was dissociated and enriched for astrocytes. mRNA transcripts specific for CXCL1 in the brains of infected double-tg mice at days 4, 7 and 12 p.i. compared with single-tg mice. mRNA transcripts were elevated in the spinal cords at days 4, 7 (p 0.05) and 12 (p 0.01) p.i. when compared with single-tg mice. quantitative PCR primers specifically anneal to an untranslated region region specific for endogenous CXCL double-tg and single-tg mice were infected with 250 PFU JHMV. administration of Dox to double-tg mice resulted in a significant increase in CXCL1 mRNA expression compared with single-tg mice within the brain at days 4, 7 and 12 p.i. data from (B) represent two experiments with a minimum of four mice per group. all quantitative real-time PCR samples were run in triplicate. superarray data were compiled used the average value of two mice per group run in duplicate. double-tg and single-tg mice were infected with 250 PFU JHMV. double-tg and single-tg mice were treated with 50 mg/kg Dox daily. clinical severity was assessed until day 30 p.i. using a four-point scale. each symbol represents one individual mouse; solid black lines represent geometric means. double-tg and single-tg mice were i.c. infected with virus. mice were sacrificed at days 4 and 7 p.i. and neutrophil (Ly6GhiCD11b+) levels in blood were measured by flow cytometry. XCL1 overexpression from the CNS resulted in significantly increased frequency of neutrophils within the blood. we also determined whether Dox-induced expression of CXCL1 affected mobilization and migration of Ly6C+ monocytes to the CNS. there were no significant differences in the frequency CD11b+Ly6C+Ly6G cells within the blood or brains of Dox-treated double-tg mice as compared with single-tg mice at defined times after infection with JHMV. however, there was a slight but significant (p 0.05) decrease in numbers of CD11b+ immunofluorescence analysis indicated that Ly6B.2+ neutrophils were primarily located at the ependymal lining and perivascular space at the spinal cord. no differences in the frequency of CD11b+Ly6C+Ly6G cells were detected within either the blood (F) or brain and spinal cords (G) between Dox-treated double-tg or single-tg mice at defined times after infection with JHMV. the increase in demyelination in double-tg mice was associated with a significant loss of mature oligodendrocytes (p 0.05) within the spinal cords. there were increased numbers of microglia (CD45loF4/80+) cells in dox-treated double-tg mice compared with infected single-tg mice within the spinal cord. expression of activation markers MHC class II (Supplemental Fig. 2) or CD80 (Supplemental Fig. 2) is associated with increased demyelination. histopathological analysis of spinal cords of double-tg mice reveals increase. neutrophil accumulation within the spinal cord correlates with increased demyelination in double-tg mice. neutrophils were enriched within the upper thoracic region of the spinal cord undergoing demyelination using anti-Ly6g mAb injection from days 3 to 15 p.i. Flow cytometric analysis revealed a significant increase in the frequency and total number of neutrophils within the spinal cord of double-tg mice. p 0.001 in the percentage of white matter demyelination compared with anti-Ly6g\u2013treated single-tg mice. dox-treated double-tg mice were treated with either anti-Ly6g Ab or isotype-matched control starting between days 3 and 4 p.i. and continuing every other day until day 15 p.i. representative flow analysis of spinal cords confirmed anti-Ly6G treatment successfully depleted neutrophils. double-tg mice were generated by crossing hemizygous human GFAP-rtTA*M2 mice to a tg mouse line incorporating a tetracycline responsive element driving expression of CXCL1 (pBI-CXCL1-rtTA) double-tg mice were generated and genotyped to confirm that they incorporated both constructs. supernatants from dox-treated double-tg and single-tg astrocytes cultures were collected and levels of CXCL1 were measured by ELISA. double-tg cultures yielded significantly elevated CXCL1 protein levels whereas single-tg cultures did not. untranslated region specific for endogenous CXCL1 mRNA and not tg CXCL1 compared with transgene-encoded CXCL1. increased mRNA transcripts are derived from the CXCL1 transgene. double-tg and single-tg mice were infected with 250 PFU JHMV. administration of Dox to double-tg mice resulted in significant increase in CXCL1 mRNA expression. dox-treated double-tg mice had statistically significant increases in CXCL1 mRNA expression over Dox-treated single-tg mice at days 4, 7 and 12 p.i. double-tg and single-tg mice reduced CNS viral titers to below detectable titers as measured by plaque assay within the brain by day 12 p.i. both double-tg and single-tg animals reduced CNS viral titers to below detectable titers. clinical severity was assessed until day 30 p.i. using a four-point scale. n = 23 single-tg mice and n = 12 double-tg mice. double-tg mice showed a significant increase in neutrophil frequency in the brain at days 4 (p 0.0001) and 7 (p 0.01) p.i. compared with single-tg mice. no differences were observed in BBB permeability within the brain or spinal cord at day 7 p.i. a slight but significant decrease in numbers of CD11b+Ly6C+Ly6G cells within the spinal cords of Dox-treated double-tg mice at day 12 p.i. compared with single-tg mice. there were no differences in numbers of CD11b+Ly6C+Ly6G cells within the blood or CNS of dox-treated double-tg mice compared with single-tg mice. two independent experiments with a minimum of three mice per group per experiment at each time point analyzed. data are presented as average SEM; statistical significance was measured using an unpaired two-tailed Student t test. demyelination is increased in response to elevated CNS expression of CXCL1 Examination of spinal cords from JHMV-infected, Dox-treated double-tg mice revealed an overall increase (p 0.05) in the severity of demyelination when compared immunoophenotyping cells infiltrating into the brain via flow cytometry revealed no differences in the frequencies or numbers of CD45hi cells at defined times after infection. however, there were no differences in CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, or virus-specific CD4+ or CD8+ T cells (Supplemental Fig. 1) infiltration into the brain or spinal cords of experimental mice. white matter damage is more concentrated within the upper thoracic (T) regions (T3\u2013T7) compared with lower T9\u2013T13 as well as lumbar (L) regions examined. increased demyelination was associated with a reduction in number total GST-+ oligodendrocytes within the white matter. double-tg mice showed a significant increase in neutrophils (p 0.05) in double-tg mice. neutrophils were enriched within the upper thoracic region of the spinal cord. these cells were relatively absent in demyelinating lesions in single-tg mice. Flow analysis of immune cell infiltrates within the spinal cord confirmed neutrophil depletion. CXCL1 protein was detected by immunohistochemical staining (red arrowheads) within spinal cords of Dox-treated double-tg mice. immunofluorescence staining further demonstrated a significant increase in the number of Ly6B.2+ neutrophils (yellow arrowheads) the severity of demyelination revealed reduced white matter damage in mice treated with anti-Ly6G Ab compared with mice treated with isogenic IgG2a control Ab. data are derived from two independent experiments with a minimum of three mice per group per experiment. double-tg mice showed a sustained increase in clinical disease severity congruent with an increase in mortality. no statistical difference in the frequencies of macrophages or T cells between double-tg and single-tg mice at day 12 p.i. an increase in the severity of white matter demyelination was observed at day 12 p.i. in dox-treated double-tg mice. this correlated with an overall decrease in the total number of GST-+ mature oligodendrocytes. recombinant CXCL1 does not kill these cells (21) neutrophils are implicated in exacerbating lesion development within spinal cords. inhibition of neutrophil elastase, a serine protease released from the primary granules of neutrophils, resulted in reduced neuroinflammation and myelin loss (27, 28). neutrophils have recently been reported to have a role in maturating local APCs within the CNS. yelinated regions include truncated morphologies and hypertrophy. we are currently evaluating how microglia may augment demyelination. findings are consistent with recent studies from Segal and colleagues."}
