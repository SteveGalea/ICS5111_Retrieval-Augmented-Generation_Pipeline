{"summary": "the characteristics of seasonal distribution of active systemic lupus erythematosus were retrospectively analyzed in 640 patients living in the city of Zhanjiang, china. in winter, when there are weaker ultraviolet (UV) rays, the ratio of patients with active SLE to total inpatients was 3.89, which is significantly higher than in other seasons with stronger UV rays. clinical data The 640 patients with active SLE were attented the Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Medical College between January 1997 and December 2006. of the 640 patients, SLE occurred for the first time or recurred as a result of stopping treatment when their condition improved. Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS (12.0) software. the correlations between the number of patients with active SLE and meteorological factors including temperature and humidity were analyzed. 640 patients with active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) had a SLEDAI score of 10. the number of patients with active SLE was highest in winter (December, January and February) and lowest at the junction between summer and autumn (july, August and September) the relative ratios of patients with active SLE were the highest in December, January and February, and lowest in July, August and September. there was no statistical significance in relative ratios of patients with active SLE between spring, summer and autumn (p>0.05). there was no statistical significance in relative ratios of patients with active SLE between spring, summer and autumn (p>0.05). correlation between the number of patients with active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and mean humidity. between January 1997 and December 2006, there were 640 patients who conformed to the diagnostic criteria for SLE and had a SLEDAI score of 10. total 640 100% Ratios of patients with active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) relative to total inpatients Results indicated that the total number of inpatients was less in January and February. the relative ratios of patients with active SLE were the highest in December, January and February. patients with active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were divided into 120 months with a \u2018month' categorized as a unit. then the mean humidity of each month was calculated. correlations between the number of patients with active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and mean humidity were analyzed. patients with active SLE in this study reside in Zhanjiang City. the number of patients with active SLE was highest in winter (December, January and February) and lowest in summer (June, July and August) the annual mean temperature is 23.2\u00b0C. in July, the mean temperature is 29.1\u00b0C, there is the most daylight and sunlight intensity is strongest. in January, the mean temperature is 16.6\u00b0C, there is least daylight. the mechanism of a high incidence of active SLE in winter and a low incidence in summer remains to be further elucidated."}
