{"summary": "VSV is a highly cytopathic virus, which at high multiplicities of infection can cause cytopathic effects as early as 1 to 2 h postinfection. virally expressed proteins are thus readily accessible to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I pathway for the generation of a robust CD8 T cell response. a vector expressing a secretion-deficient mutant of the HBV middle surface envelope glycoprotein (MS) the mutant MS protein used in this study contains a cysteine-to-alanine alteration at residue 69 (C69A), known to be essential for subviral particle secretion (40) e presentation enhances CTL responses, once maximum CTL activity is reached, additional epitope presentation provides no further advantages. we previously generated a VSV vector expressing wild-type MS (VSV-MS) which elicits robust HBV envelope-specific CD8 T cell responses and generates high antibody titers in mice (15). vaccinia virus-infected cells were cotransfected with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing T7 RNA polymerase (multiplicity of infection [MOI], 10). supernatants were collected 48 h posttransfection, filtered through an 0.2-m filter to remove vaccinia virus. titer was determined, and it was stored at 80\u00b0C until use. a portion of each lysate was treated with 100 units endoglycosidase H (EndoH) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. proteins were separated on a 10% SDS gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. secreted HBsAg was detected both in vitro and in vivo. inhalational anesthetization was performed on mice with 30% (vol/vol) isoflurane (Baxter) diluted in propylene glycol prior to all immunizations. DNA immunizations were performed by intramuscular injection of pCMV-MS or pCMV-MSC69A. assay set (BD Biosciences) was used to quantify CD8 T cell activation. plates were coated overnight with purified anti-mouse IFN- antibody (1:200) plates were blocked for 2 h using DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 U/ml penicillin, and 2 mM l-glutamine. ELISPOT assay plates were prepared as described above. we previously had found the CD4 T cell response to MS to be greater at day 14 postinfection than at day 7. splenocytes for this assay were removed 14 days postinfection. both CD4 T cells and CD11c DCs were resuspended in complete DMEM. cells were incubated with 10 mg/ml recombinant MS protein (Biospacific) for 3 days at 37\u00b0C. diluted serum was incubated in a precoated HBsAg ELISA plate for 60 min. a recombinant VSV vector containing MSC69A (VSV-MSC69A) was recovered as previously described. BHK-21 cells grown to 50% confluence were infected with vaccinia virus expressing T7 RNA polymerase. supernatants were collected 48 h posttransfection, filtered through an 0.2-m filter to remove vaccinia virus. cells were treated with 2 M or 10 M lactacystin (Calbiochem) medium was collected, and cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed with 2 SDS sample buffer. secreted HBsAg was detected both in vitro and in vivo. sates and media were collected, and HBsAg was measured using a commercially available ELISA kit. secretion deficiency was confirmed in vivo following intranasal (i.n.) infection of VSV-MS or VSV-MSC69A. a gamma interferon (IFN-) enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) assay set was used to quantify CD8 T cell activation following immunization. plates were coated overnight with purified anti-mouse IFN- antibody (1:200) after removal of capture antibody, plates were blocked for 2 h. splenocytes were removed 14 days postinfection and treated with collagenase D (Roche) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. spleen tissue was passed through 70-m strainers (BD Falcon) for CD4 T cell purification, spleen tissue was then passed through 70-m strainers (BD Falcon) cells were washed and resuspended in MACS buffer and incubated with 100 l CD11c microbeads per 108 cells for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. both CD4 T cells and CD11c DCs were resuspended in complete DMEM, counted, and seeded. in vitro replication of VSV-MSC69A in BHK-21 cells was comparable to that of VSV-MSC69A. the gene encoding MSC69A inserted in the fifth position of the VSV genome was diagrammed from the 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 orientation of the negative-stranded viral RNA genome. 69A-infected cells maintained the secretion-deficient phenotype when expressed from VSV. previous studies demonstrating that MSC69A is improperly processed and/or trafficked intracellularly. secreted MS protein was detected in the medium of VSV-MS-infected GM-CSF-treated murine bone marrow cells. proteins in the lysate from VSV-MSC69A-infected cells were deglycosylated using an EndoH reaction. splenocytes were isolated from CB6F1 (H-2bxd) mice receiving intranasal inoculations of 1106 PFU of VSV, VSV-MS, or VSV-MSC69A. VSV-MS- and VSV-MSC69A-immunized mice generated similar CD8 T cell responses to the four HBs peptides. the memory responses were comparable between mice immunized with VSV-MS and those immunized with VSV-MSC69A. two peptides corresponding to known HBV-specific epitopes (designated 191 and 364); and a VSV N peptide were used to stimulate splenocytes. mice were boosted 3 weeks after pCMV-MS (n = 3) prime with VSV-MS or VSV-MSC69A. HBsAb ELISAs were conducted to determine the effect that expression of the secretion-deficient protein MSC69A from VSV would have on antibody titers. serum was collected from mice via retro-orbital bleed on days 30 and 60 post-intranasal immunization with 1 106, 1 104, or 1 102 PFU of VSV-MS or VSV-MSC69A. a HBsAb isotype-specific ELISA was conducted on serum collected 30 and 60 days postimmunization to measure specific antibody titers. despite differences in antigen processing, there were no statistically significant differences between MS-specific antibody titers for isotypes. immunization with pCMV-MS generated significantly higher antibody titers (P = 0.02) than pCMV-MSC69A, which generated titers barely above the limit of detection. infection with VSVM51 results in reduced cytopathic and apoptotic effects. VSVM51-MSC69A is also attenuated compared to the wild-type VSV vector. even lower antibody titers were generated after VSVM51-MSc69A immunization. cytopathic release of antigen is required for robust antibody responses. perforin-knockout mice do not express perforin, a major component of the cytotoxic granules released from CTLs. any release of virally expressed proteins in these mice can be attributed to the cytopathic effects of the virus itself. ine-to-alanine mutation at residue 69 (MSC69A) was PCR amplified and cloned into a plasmid DNA vector carrying the VSV genome. after sequencing confirmed that the plasmid contained no PCR-generated mutations, a recombinant VSV, designated VSV-MSC69A, was recovered. increased accumulation of unglycosylated MS in VSV-MSC69A-infected cells. we also determined whether MSC69A maintained the secretion-deficient phenotype when expressed from VSV. previous studies showed that MSC69A is improperly processed and/or trafficked intracellularly. proteins in the lysate from VSV-MSC69A-infected cells were deglycosylated using an EndoH reaction. infected BHK cell lysate and media were collected 8 or 6 h postinfection. MS expression following infection was determined by HBsAg ELISA. 8 T cell response was analyzed following an overnight stimulation with a VSV N peptide. two peptides corresponding to known HBV-specific, H-2d-restricted epitopes. the memory responses were comparable between mice immunized with VSV-MS and those immunized with VSV-MSC69A. y days postimmunization, splenocytes were harvested and memory responses were analyzed using an IFN-ELISPOT assay. mice were boosted 3 weeks after pCMV-MS (n = 3) or pCMV-MSC69A (n = 4) prime with VSV-MS or VSV-MSC69A, respectively. VSV-MS and VSV-MSC69A elicited comparable CD4 T cell responses 14 days postboost. HBsAb ELISAs were conducted in order to determine the effect that expression of the secretion-deficient protein MSC69A from VSV would have on antibody titers. a quantitative HBsAb ELISA was conducted on serum collected 30 and 60 days postimmunization to determine isotype-specific antibody titers. despite differences in antigen processing, there were no statistically significant differences between MS-specific antibody titers for isotypes. pCMV-MS or pCMV-MSC69A were boosted with the same plasmids on days 30 and 60 postprime and bled on days 30, 60, and 90 postprime. in a DNA-based system, antigen secretion is required for antibody generation, as immunization with pCMV-MSC69A generated significantly higher antibody titers (P = 0.02) than did that with pCMV-MSC69A, VSVM51 is also attenuated compared to the wild-type VSV vector. even lower antibody titers were generated after VSVM51-MSC69A immunization. cytopathic release of antigen is required for robust antibody responses. perforin-knockout mice do not express perforin, a major component of the cytotoxic granules released from CTLs. however, any release of virally expressed proteins in these mice can be attributed to the cytopathic effects of the virus itself. modifying antigen expression in DNA-based vaccine vectors can alter immunogenicity. antibody responses to DNA-based vaccines, however, are particularly sensitive to the properties of the expressed antigen. a VSV-based vaccine vector expressing a secretion-deficient HBV antigen (MSC69A) induces HBV-specific immune responses comparable to those to the corresponding wild-type, secreted HBV antigen (MS) there is no difference in the CD8 T cell responses between vectors, though one might predict that increased cytoplasmic turnover of MSC69A could enhance MHC class I presentation. VSV matrix inhibits host cell synthesis and the transport of RNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. the evasion of the host innate immune response by VSV likely provides antigen-presenting cells with an abundance of antigen. this evasion may contribute to the superior adaptive immune response seen following VSV immunization. infection with VSVM51 results in reduced cytopathic and apoptotic effects. VSVM51 expressing a foreign protein, HIV Env (VSVM51-EnvG), is not capable of inducing as potent an EnvG-specific CD8 T cell response as that induced by immunization with wild-type VSV-EnvG (46). the induction of potent immune responses to VSV-expressed antigen is largely dependent on intracellular antigen processing. the unique ability of VSV to induce rapid cytopathic effects may account for its superior induction of CD8 T cell responses compared to other viral vaccine vectors. this is further supported by a study demonstrating that targeting of antigen for rapid intracellular degradation can enhance CD8 T cell responses after immunization with a vaccinia virus vaccine vector (64). the characteristics of the vector have the capacity to affect vaccine efficacy as much as, if not more than, the properties of the vectored antigen itself. the immune response to a VSV-based vaccine vector is independent of antigen secretion and cytoplasmic processing."}
