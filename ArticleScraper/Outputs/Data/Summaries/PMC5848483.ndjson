{"summary": "459 hospitalized children and adult RTI patients were screened for respiratory viruses by polymerase chain reaction from April 2013 to April 2016. the VP2 gene from WU virus-positive samples was sequenced and subjected to phylogenetic analysis. two human polyomavirus species were first identified in 1971 from a urine sample of a kidney allograft recipient with chronic pyelonephritis and advanced renal failure. the KI virus was detected in nasopharyngeal aspirates and feces from a patient with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy [4]. a total of 459 hospitalized children and adult patients with viral RTI were screened for WUV during opharyngeal aspirates were sampled from patients with RTI admitted to medical wards, intensive care unit or pediatric ICU. samples were delivered to the Virology Laboratory within 2 h to decrease possible degradation of the viral nucleic acid. the best available nucleotide substitution model was chosen using the FindModel application [13]. Epidemiological classification of WUV types was established using the neighbor-joining method. amplification of the WUV VP2 Typing region and phylogenetic analysis was granted by the health science center and the KIMS (Kuwait Institute for Medical Specialization) clinical data were obtained from the patients' medical records. the best available nucleotide substitution model was chosen using the FindModel application. the evolutionary history was established using the neighbor-joining method. the tree was made to scale, with branch lengths in similar units. Intensive care unit 1 (5.6%) Diagnosis Upper respiratory tract infection 7 (38.9%) Lower respiratory tract infection 11 (61.1%) Nationality Kuwaiti 10 (55.6%) Non-Kuwaiti 8 (44.4%) The 18 cases of WUV infection were distributed among various age groups. median age of the patients infected was 13 years. the 18 circulating strains belong to type Ia and the 4th belongs to type IIIb. the circulating strains belong to the type Ia and among non-Kuwaitis (Indians) to IIIb. the Indian patient is a resident of Kuwait for the past 10 years. the pathogenic potential of the WUV in respiratory tract diseases remains unanswered due in part to high co-infection rates with other viruses. from 18 samples, only 4 genomic WUV DNAs were sequenced and phylogenetic trees constructed. this was probably due to the inconsistent collection of specimens or low viral load. future investigations should be in case-control studies including larger patient cohorts."}
