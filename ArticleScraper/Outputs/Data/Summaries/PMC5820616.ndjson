{"summary": "revised table 2 by adding categories previously omitted from the table. for example, in version 1 we only presented in the table the number of health workers that indicated they felt at extremely low or low risk. in version 2 we have added a column indicating the number of health workers feeling at high or extremely high risk. the world health organization (WHO) has the mandate to support Member states in preparing for and responding to a wide range of public health emergencies. a rapid review of efficacy and comparative effectiveness studies addressing the use of specific PPE items for EVD in outbreak settings was lacking 8. the underlying principle was that evidence from efficacy and comparative effectiveness studies was necessary but insufficient for contextualization and adequate decision-making. the purpose of this study was to support the development process of a WHO rapid advice guideline on PPE for EVD care in outbreaks. the specific objectives were to understand and describe frontline physician and nurses\u2019 perspectives about PPE use while providing direct care for EVD patients in the unprecedented conditions of the 2014\u20132016 EVD outbreak. five experts reviewed the study protocol and questionnaire during the development phase. three clinicians with experience in the EVD outbreak field-tested the survey for consistency, readability, completeness, and question sequencing. the final version of the online survey incorporated all relevant feedback and comments. two independent researchers analysed open-ended questions with STATA 10 (StataCorp. 2007) using counts, proportions, and the Chi-square test when comparisons were appropriate. the researchers then grouped the interpretation and understanding of the participants\u2019 ideas and selected quotes to represent these findings. approach In September 2014, we electronically surveyed international frontline physicians and nurses who participated in foreign medical teams deployed to the affected countries in early stages of the EVD outbreak. this survey was developed and delivered at the height of outbreak and that WHO had very limited time available to produce guidance. a follow-up email reminded potential participants of the deadline (10 days after launching) participants could withdraw from the study at any time without providing any justification. the study population consisted of international frontline physicians and nurses with direct field experience caring for EVD patients in west africa. two independent researchers analysed closed-ended questions with STATA 10 (StataCorp. 2007) using counts, proportions, and the Chi-square test when comparisons were appropriate. this encompassed close reading and re-reading of the answers using constant comparison within and across different participants. the researchers then grouped the interpretation and understanding of the participants\u2019 ideas and selected quotes to represent these findings. we invited 192 health workers (166 from MSF and 26 from WHO) to participate in the survey and 74 (39%) responded. respondents from MSF included 30 logisticians and water, sanitation and hygiene experts. therefore 44 participants (33 physicians and 11 nurses) were included in the final analysis and their characteristics are described in Table 1. health workers felt at low or extremely low risk regardless of the type of PPE used. heat and dehydration were a significant or major issue for 31 participants using goggles (76%) compared to two (29%) using a face shield (p=0.02) and for 27 (64%) using a hood compared to none using a hair cover. eye protection Face shield (n=7) 7 (100%) 0 (0%) 4 (57%) 3 (43%) 3 (43%) 4 (57%) 5 (71%) 2 (29%) 5 (71%) 2 (29%) Goggles (n=42) 31/40 (78%)

issue with goggles. some participants indicated that the goggles caused pain after using them for extended periods. other issues were the poor quality of face shield and particulate respirator. full PPE causes heat exhaustion and dehydration. a number of health workers indicated they had difficulty taking off the coverall. one respondent said that boots were too big causing difficulty walking on irregular ground. participants were very confident that they were using PPE correctly. 17 (39%) were reasonably confident and 1 (2%) was not very confident. participants were least confident about goggles (fogging, moving/displacing), medical masks and particulate respirators. heat and dehydration were a significant or major issue for 31 participants using goggles (76%) compared to two (29%) using a face shield (p=0.02) and for 27 (64%) using a hood compared to none using a hair cover (p=0.02) there was no significant difference between the two groups (p=0.41). mouth protection Medical

(64%) * 27/42 (64%) 15/42 (36%) a medical mask and particulate respirator were reported to cause difficulty breathing when wet (due to sweat or condensation) one participant doubted the mask\u2019s effectiveness when wet. the main problem regarding gloves was the risk of having them slip down. training on PPE use A third of survey participants had received formal training over 2 to 3 days (n=15, 34%) and four (9%) reported training duration of more than 3 days. 20% (n=9) had no formal or on-the-job training and another 20% (n=9) reported training for 2 hours or less. participants were least confident about goggles (fogging, moving/displacing), medical masks and particulate respirators (difficulty breathing, becoming uncomfortable), gloves (rolling down, tearing), and gloves (rolling down, tearing) a respondent also mentioned feeling less confident working in the screening area where much lighter PPE was worn. a rapid review of the effectiveness of different types of PPE for protecting health workers revealed insufficient evidence upon which to draw conclusions about optimal PPE 8. the results of this study formed a critical part of the evidence upon which the recommendations developed by the expert panel were based. if we had had more time for field testing we could have revised the questionnaire before formal data collection began. a study carried out in response to the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome found that PPE made of more breathable material did not lead to significant difference in contamination but did have greater user satisfaction 13, 14. participants mentioned that they would improvise and tape gloves to the coverall in order to prevent them from slipping down. then the coverall would tear when removing the tape. this is particularly relevant if there are frequent changes in the availability of specific types of PPE. the online format of the survey allowed us to quickly reach a larger number of health workers who had recent personal experience with different types of PPE in the EVD outbreak. open-ended questions made analysis of trade-offs and comparisons of health workers\u2019 preferences possible while open-ended questions allowed the survey participants to share additional thoughts and perspectives in more depth. if we had had more time for field testing we could have revised the questionnaire before formal data collection began. if we had had more time for field testing we invited to participate and consequently received responses from workers without direct clinical experience who had been deployed to the EVD outbreak. study limitations Most of the limitations of this study were caused by pragmatic decisions the research team had to make in order to complete the study in the available time. this was in and of itself an invaluable learning experience for undertaking similar projects in the future. the online format of the survey allowed us to quickly reach a larger number of health workers in different countries who had recent personal experience with different types of PPE. open-ended questions made analysis of trade-offs and comparisons of health workers\u2019 preferences possible while open-ended questions allowed the survey participants to share additional thoughts and perspectives in more depth. supplementary material Supplementary File 1: Study
