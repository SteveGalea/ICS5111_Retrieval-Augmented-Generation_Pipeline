{"summary": "inTRODUCTION Yersinia genius contains three species of bacteria pathogenic to humans. yersinia pestis is transmitted by fleas while Y. tuberculosis and Y. enterocolitica are transmitted by the fecal oral route. yersinia sp. uses a type III secretion system for translocation of virulence effectors into the host cell. yersinia pestis is one of the most virulent infectious agents threatening humans. there is an ever increasing risk of the use of Y. pestis by unauthorized groups as a biological weapon of terror. the growing resistance of humans to antibiotics is one of the reasons to search for new treatment options. ATA is considered to be a potential anti-AIDS compound by preventing binding of HIV coat protein, gp120, to its CD4 receptor. it does so by the inhibition of phosphatase activity of viral enzyme. ATA has also been found to prevent apoptosis in a variety of cell models. ATA inactivates YopH and CD45 phosphatases at nanomolar concentrations. ATA inactivates Y. pestis with greater potency than peroctanoic acid. peroctanoic acid was found to be a stronger inhibitor of CD45. recombinant YopH was pretreated for 15 minutes with 100 nM ATA. the increase of activity of YopH was measured every minute on microplate reader as absorbance at 405 nm using pNPP substrate. catalase pretreatment almost completely protected from ATA induced YopH inactivation. elimination of inhibitory effects of ATA in the presence of catalase and a loss of thiol adducts after ATA treatment may lead to the conclusion that ATA is probably inactivating PTPs due to an oxidative mechanism. cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of a) ATA - concentration 4.9 104 M in DMSO solution (black line) b) hydrogen peroxide - concentration 1, 5 103 M (red line) c) potential window obtained in DMSO in 0.1 M TBAP solution. the disappearance of the anodic peak indicates that oxygen radicals react with the molecule of ATA. this peak reached a constant value at 3.7 104 M of ATA concentration and is higher than the current peak for oxygen reduction (red line) the current signal obtained for ATA is very similar to the cyclic voltammograms observed for hydrogen peroxide. docking studies showed that ATA can be easily accommodated inside the binding site and binds specifically in a catalytic center of YopH. the site of binding for top 30 conformations of pTyr obtained from docking of pTyr into the YopH structure. two carboxyl groups of ATA are directed toward essential Cys403 and Arg409 residues in the active site. there are electrostatic interactions between polar groups of ATA with Cys403 and Arg409 and water. Polar + G non-Polar GPolar is the polar contribution to the solvation free energy. TS represents the entropic term and needs to be calculated by normal mode analysis. ATA exhibits stronger binding to YopH than its natural substrate phosphotyrosine. the human CD45 recombinant protein tyrosine phosphatase was used to study the inhibitory properties of ATA on human PTP. ATA inactivated Y. pestis YopH with greater potency than peroctanoic acid, but peroctanoic acid was found to be a stronger inhibitor of CD45. after 15 minutes of treatment with 100 nM ATA with/without catalase (500U/ml) data presented as absorbance (420 nm), means SD (n = 3). one-way Anova test. * significantly different (P 0.001). the enzymatic activity of YopH was measured on microplate reader as absorbance at 405 nm using pNPP substrate. data presented as percent of control, means SD (n = 10). T-test analysis of variance. *significantly different (P 0.001) from control, **significantly different (P 0.001) in pairs. cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of a - e) hydrogen peroxide at different concentrations from 1.6 104 M (black dotted line) to 6.0 103 M (blue line) and ATA at concentration of 9.5 105 M (red dotted line), conditions: scan rate 100 mV/s. the disappearance of the anodic peak indicates that oxygen radicals react with the molecule of ATA. the value of the current obtained for ATA at a concentration of 4.9 104 M is comparable to the hydrogen peroxide at a concentration of 1.5 103 M performed for potentials from 1.25 V to 2.5 V. this may indicate that the hydrogen peroxide could be present during the redox process of ATA. site of binding for top 30 conformations of pTyr obtained from docking of pTyr into the YopH structure. in each conformation ATA binds in the YopH active site. the binding energies of ATA and pTyr to YopH were calculated. the components are described below: Evdw = the Van der Waals contribution from MM. Eele = Electrostatic energy as calculated by the MM force field Gpolar. E MM = E int + E ele + E vdw EMM is the molecular mechanics contribution to binding in vacuo expressed as a sum of the internal, electrostatic and van der Waals\u2019 contributions. ATA exhibits stronger binding to YopH than its natural substrate phosphotyrosine. ATA is more effective against YopH phosphatase than CD45. reduction assay indicated that ATA is a reversible inhibitor of YopH. the presence of catalase abolished the effect of ATA on YopH. ATA can accommodate itself well inside the binding site as compared to pTyr. ATA can accommodate itself well inside the binding site as compared to pTyr. the binding conformation of ATA in the YopH active site contributed to the relatively strong calculated binding affinity of ATA. the solutions of the recombinant PTPs were prepared in 10 mM HEPES buffer pH 7.4. the final concentration of phosphatase in reaction samples was 0.8 g/mL (10 nM) the YopHs and CD45 enzymes were untreated (control) or treated with solution of ATA and peroctanoic acid. the amount of modified YopH thiol adduct with NBD (Cys-S-NBD adduct) was measured after 30 minutes incubation with NDB-Cl as absorbance at 420 nm with a spectrophotometer. the experiments were performed using an Autolab potentiostat/galvanostat (model PGSTAT30) supported by the GPES software. chain A of this pdb file contains 306 residues. chain A was removed from this pdb file. aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) and phosphotyrosine (pTyr) were docked into the structure of YopH. a Berendsen barostat with a collision frequency of 2 ps and a pressure relaxation time of 1 ps, respectively. we have used the velocity-Verlet algorithm (default algorithm for the Amber MD package) recombinant YopH protein tyrosine phosphatase from Yersinia pestis was obtained from millipore and YopH from Yersinia enterocolitica was obtained from Calbiochem. the solutions of the recombinant PTPs were prepared in 10 mM HEPES buffer pH 7.4. the final concentration of phosphatase in reaction samples was 0.8 g/mL (10 nM) the recombinant phosphatase YopH was inactivated by ATA. the amount of modified YopH thiol adduct with NBD was measured after 30 minutes incubation with NDB-Cl as absorbance at 420 nm. the initial structure of YopH was imported from the RCSB protein data bank (http://www.pdb.org) with code 2YDU.pdb [28] the structure was minimized using taff.ff forcefield of the Molecular Operating Environment software (MOE, chemical computing group) chain A of this pdb file contains 306 residues. the systems were then gradually heated from 10 to 300 K over a period of 50 ps. they were then maintained in the isothermal\u2013isobaric ensemble (NPT) at a target temperature of 300 K and a target pressure of 1 bar using a Langevin thermostat and a Berendsen barostat with a collision frequency of 2 ps. Statistical analyses were performed using ANOVA combined with Tukey's test or T test combined with Wilcoxon test."}
