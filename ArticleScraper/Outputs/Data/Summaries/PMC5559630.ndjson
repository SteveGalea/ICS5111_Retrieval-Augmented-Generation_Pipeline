{"summary": "YFV is one of the safest and most potent vaccines ever developed. despite close genetic proximity, the differential interactions of YFV and YFV-17D with the human host remain unknown. type I IFN is responsible for the immune response to many viruses. yFV-17D and virulent YFV can escape the human type I IFN-induced antiviral state. type II IFN alone seems to be of limited importance for clearing a majority of viruses (11) however, IFN- does play a major role during the late stage of infection when the innate immune system has failed to control the early stages of infection and the adaptive immune response is induced. type III IFN-mediated signaling conceivably plays a unique role in protecting epithelial barriers by the activity of a more localized and balanced immune response. IFN- has also been shown to display important and specific roles in the modulation of adaptive immune responses during cancer, viral infection, and autoimmune diseases. RESULTS IFN-/R/ R/ mice are hypersusceptible to YFV-17D infection. we infected WT, R/, R/, and R/ mice with YFV-17D (106 PFU) exhibited similar initial signs of morbidity, but the symptoms worsened and the animals became moribund or died. most of the R/ R/ mice, in contrast to the R/ mice, were not able to recover from infection. we suggest that IFN- likely plays a role in preventing worsening of YFV-17D-induced disease at later stages of infection. YFV-17D to the central nervous system (CNS) quantified viral RNA in the serum of WT, R/, R/, and R/ mice. as expected, the WT and R/ mice exhibited low levels of viremia throughout this period, likely resulting in complete viral clearance. positive-strand RNA copies were quantified by RT-qPCR. the limit of detection is represented by the lowest y axis value. YFV-17D persisted longer (up to 5 days) in other tissues. rare cases of neurologic adverse effects have been observed in YFV-17D-infected rhesus macaques, human vaccinees (2, 24\u201326), and R/ mice (7). viral load in the brains of R/ mice was more elevated than in those of WT and R/ mice at day 5 postinfection. yFV-17D neurovirulence in rhesus macaques has been characterized by the presence of perivascular cuffs and infiltrating mononuclear inflammatory cells in the brain cortex. at day 5 postinfection, all infected brains, regardless of the mouse model, exhibited signs of neuropil vacuolization (or spongiosis) in the brain cortex consistent with all mouse models exhibiting brain viremia. despite significant viral replication, we did not observe major histopathological changes in the liver of infected R/ and R/ mice at day 5 postinfection. this adds to the evidence that viral replication in the liver is not directly involved in the pathogenesis observed in R/ R/ mice. this adds to the evidence that viral replication in the liver is not directly involved in the pathogenesis observed in R/ mice. a statistically significant increase in the BBB permeability of R/ R/ mice. the permeability of the liver and kidney remained unchanged upon infection. we suggest that type III IFN signaling is an important regulator in preserving BBB integrity during extensive YFV-17D infection. six tissue sections from three biological replicates were examined. results are representative of three biological replicates. increased BBB permeability is commonly associated with enhanced lymphocyte infiltration in the central nervous system. c cells (cDCs), plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and monocytes (MN) decreased upon YFV-17D infection. number of spleen-resident macrophages decreased upon infection in WT and R/ mice but not in R/ and R/ R/ mice. Statistical analysis shows significant differences between the results determined under noninfected (Mk, mock) and infected (YFV-17D) conditions for each mouse strain and cell lineage. CD4+, CD4+, CD8+ T cells, cDCs, conventional dendritic cells, pDCs, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, MN, monocytes; MPH, macrophages. type III IFN-mediated signaling appeared to affect peripheral pDCs upon infection, as the number increased only in the WT and R/ mice. the absence of type III IFN signaling in R/ mice could thus significantly perturb the correct immune balance and coordination. the spleens of R/ and R/ R/ mice exhibited an increase in the levels of CCR7 CD62L CD4+ and CD8+ T cells upon infection. a decrease in the levels of CCR7 CD62L CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was observed in R/ and R/ R/ mice. 45RA CD62L CD8+ T cells in R/ and R/ mice supports this conclusion. in the liver, increases in the number of effector CD62L CD44+ CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells were also observed. peripheral CD62L CD45RA and CD62L CD44+ CD4+ T cells were more prominent in R/ and R/ R/ mice. however, only partial T-cell activation was found in R/ mice. phenotype of CD3+ CD4+ and CD3+ CD8+ T-cell populations in spleen (A and C) and blood (B) of noninfected (Mk, mock) or infected (YFV-17D) WT (black), R/ (green), R/ (blue) and R/ R/ (red) mice at day 5 following YFV-17D infection (107 PFU) was performed. fewer CD8+ T cells displayed activated (CD45RA CD127) phenotype in R/ R/ mice. increased BBB permeability was not observed in noninfected R/ R/ mice. the cytokine profiles of all infected R/ and R/ R/ mice distinctly clustered separately from the profiles of noninfected animals. of the 12 cytokines that we quantified, 9 exhibited a significant increase upon infection in R/ and/or R/ R/ mice. only 1 (MCP-1) exhibited a slight increase upon infection of R/ mice. differences in blood cytokine concentrations between infected mice at day 5 post-YFV-17D infection (107 PFU) significant elevation in concentration of multiple cytokines in R/ and/or R/ R/ mice was associated with YFV-17D replication in YFV-17D vaccinees and in other R/ mouse models. IFN-/R/ R/ mice are hypersusceptible to YFV-17D infection. we infected mice with YFV-17D (106 PFU) and monitored survival rates. R/ R/ mice showed increased susceptibility to viral infection. /R/ R/ mice are hypersusceptible to YFV-17D-induced disease. survival of WT (black), R/ (green), R/ (blue) and R/ (red) mice following YFV-17D infection with 106 PFU (A) or 107 PFU (B) RNA in the serum of WT, R/, R/, and R/ R/ mice at days 0, 1, 3, and 5 postinfection. viremia of mice prior to YFV-17D infection and at days 1, 3, and 5 postinfection. positive-strand RNA copies were quantified by RT-qPCR. the limit of detection is represented by the lowest y axis value. evidence of viral replication was found in all tested tissues (spleen, thymus, liver, kidney, and brain) yFV-17D-infected rhesus macaques, human vaccinees and (7) cases of neurologic adverse effects have been observed. the viral load in the brains of R/ mice was more elevated than in those of WT and R/ mice at day 5 postinfection. all infected brains, regardless of the mouse model, exhibited signs of neuropil vacuolization (or spongiosis) in the brain cortex consistent with all mouse models exhibiting brain viremia. this histopathological manifestation has been previously reported during WNV brain invasion (27, 28) and other neurovirulent flavivirus infections (29). however, spongiosis appeared to be more prominent in R/ R/ mice. no significant acute/chronic inflammations, hepatocellular changes, fibrosis, or necrosis was observed in these mice compared to noninfected mice or infected WT or R/ mice. this adds to the evidence that viral replication in the liver is not directly involved in the pathogenesis observed in R/ R/ mice. increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier in IFN-/R/ R/ mice during YFV-17D infection. liver and kidney remained unchanged upon YFV-17D infection. we suggest that type III IFN signaling is an important regulator in preserving BBB integrity during extensive YFV-17D infection. arrows indicate areas with severe lymphocyte infiltration. increased BBB permeability is commonly associated with enhanced lymphocyte infiltration in the central nervous system of WT mice during WNV infection. macrophages decreased upon infection in WT and R/ mice, but not in R/ and R/ R/ mice. similar changes in CD4+ T-cell numbers were also found in R/ mice. CD4+, CD4+ T cells; CD8+, CD8+ T cells; cDCs, conventional dendritic cells; pDCs, plasmacytoid dendritic cells; MN, monocytes; MPH, macrophages; NK cells, natural killer cells; NKT cells, natural killer T cells. similar fluctuations in these cellular subsets were observed in the livers of R/ R/ mice but not in those of R/ mice. depletion of type III IFN signaling impairs T-cell activation during YFV-17D infection. yFV-17D infection was previously shown to be cleared from R/ mice by a T-cell-specific response (16) we analyzed changes in expression of multiple activation/exhaustion markers on the surface of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells during infection (day 5 postinfection) the spleens of R/ and R/ R/ mice exhibited an increase in the levels of CCR7 CD62L CD4+ and CD8+ T cells upon infection. a decrease in the levels of CD44 CD62L+ CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and an increase in the levels of CD45RA CD8+ T cells in R/ and R/ R/ mice. peripheral CD62L CD45RA and CD62L CD44+ CD8+ T cells were more prominent in R/ and R/ mice. however, only partial T-cell activation was found in R/ R/ mice. levels of spleen-resident CD45RA CD127 and CD45RA CCR7 CD4+ T-cell populations increased in R/ mice. fected (YFV-17D) mice at day 5 following YFV-17D infection (107 PFU) were characterized by quantifying expression of activation or exhaustion markers. panel A and C delineate spleen-resident T-cell activation profiles that are found to be similar or different respectively between R/ and R/ mice. depletion of type III IFN signaling negatively impacts T-cell activation. increased BBB permeability was not observed in noninfected R/ R/ mice. of the 12 cytokines we quantified, 9 showed a significant increase upon infection in R/ and/or R/ R/ mice. only 1 (MCP-1) showed a slight increase upon infection of R/ mice. no increases were detected in infected WT mice. significant elevation in concentration of multiple cytokines in R/ and/or R/ mice was associated with YFV-17D replication. increase in serum IP-10 levels has been associated with YFV-17D replication in YFV-17D vaccinees and in other R/ mouse models. the role of type I and type II IFN signaling in controlling YFV-17D infection is less well defined. a significantly larger fraction of R/ mice died upon YFV-17D infection. this phenotype was associated with severe neuroinvasion. type III IFN-mediated signaling depletion led to adaptive immune response. depletion of type I and type II or both type I and type III IFN-mediated signaling led to severe pathogenesis and death through distinct mechanisms. this correlated with immunogenicity, suggesting a link between the type I IFN response and immunogenicity. the precise nature of this link remains to be understood. previous studies have demonstrated the ability of type III IFN to mediate an antiviral response at multiple epithelial barriers. both type I and type III IFNs have been identified in the regulation of BBB permeability and prevention of viral neuroinvasion during infection of mouse models with WNV (22, 30). however, even when potent viral replication was induced, no changes in BBB permeability were observed in the brain of R/ mice despite a more elevated amount of viral RNA. disrupting type III IFN signaling in R/ mice increased BBB permeability upon infection. a hypothetical model would be that type III IFN signaling preserves the integrity of the BBB at its steady-state level upon viscerotropic flavivirus infection. specific immunological changes induced by depletion of type III IFN do not mirror an effective adaptive immune response. additional variations in cell lineage frequencies were also observed only in R/ R/ mice, suggesting that the depletion of both type I and type III IFN can synergistically perturb immune cell proliferation. R/ R/ mice showed a more prominent number of infiltrating T cells in their brain than R/ mice. a potential defect in T-cell-mediated immunity and viral neuroinvasion could create an environment enabling more-extensive viral replication in the brain and viral neuroinvasion. disruption of type III IFN signaling appeared to stimulate, not reverse, this bias. we observed a strong increase in number of IFN- producer cells in R/ R/ mice upon infection. this increase could favor immune evasion through continued stimulation of Th1 differentiation and IFN- production. despite differences between mouse and human immune responses, rare cases of neurological adverse effects following YFV-17D infection have been observed in rhesus macaques and human vaccinees. rare cases of YFV-17D-associated viscerotropic disease have been associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes coding for critical actors in the innate immune response. treatment with IFN- could counterbalance neurotropic manifestations in human vaccinees developing neurologic symptoms. type III IFN signaling is a central regulator of a tight immune balance that preserves both host immune functions and the integrity of the central nervous system during YFV-17D infection. rin (PE)-Texas Red clone 30F11 (dilution 1/100); from Biolegends (San Diego, CA), CD3-PE-Cy7 clone 17A2 (dilution 1/100) and CD4-Alexa Fluor 700 clone V4 (dilution 1/100); from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA, USA), CD8-V500 clone 53-6.7 (d infectious clone constructs, cloning, and in vitro transcription. pACNR-YFV-17D low-copy-number backbone was transformed and amplified. cDNA was purified using an E.Z.N.A. endonuclease-free Maxiprep kit. 5.4 107 Huh7.5 cells were electroporated with 18 g of RNA. at 72 h postelectroporation, virus was pooled and concentrated 40-fold to 100-fold using millipore 10,000-molecular-weight-cutoff spin filter columns. at 4 days postinfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed with 100% ethanol for 25 min, and stained with 0.1% crystal violet. the PFU count for each dilution was then determined. hematoxylin and eosin staining (to stain T-lymphocyte) were performed by the Histopathology Reference Lab (HRL) using the standard procedure. tissue (liver and brain [or brain only for lymphocyte infiltration analysis] was examined using 6 tissue sections from three biological replicates. splenocytes were strained through a 100-m-pore-size cell strainer. splenocytes were then centrifuged and lysed with 10% (vol/vol) FBS\u2013DMEM twice. supernatants containing intrahepatic lymphocytes were transferred into a new 50-ml tube.
