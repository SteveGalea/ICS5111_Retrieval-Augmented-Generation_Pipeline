{"summary": "the effects of complex selective processes, such as epistasis and pleiotropy, on viral intragenomic interactions are partially understood in theoretical terms. the multiple-sequence alignments that underlie most genetic analyses assume that each position in an alignment is independent of all others. a genome-wide approach identifies covariances resulting from all possible causes. tropic flavivirus has an 9,600-nucleotide (nt) positive-polarity single-stranded RNA genome that causes hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. individual isolates of a given viral subtype differ from each other by >28% and multiple subtypes per genotype. covariance networks formed by sequences from responders to therapy differed from those formed by nonresponder sequences. similar conclusions were reached by Lara et al. (41) using the pre- and posttherapy Virahep-C HCV sequences that we generated. all sequences in these analyses must be colinear to maintain a consistent numbering system. the first open reading frame (ORF) in the hepatitis E virus (HEV) sequences contains a polyproline stretch of 52 amino acids (57, 58) that failed to align (19), so this repetitive sequence was removed from the covariance analyses. the expected number for the pair is given by the following equation: N exp = C xi C yj N valid where Nvalid is the number of sequences in the alignment that are nongap residues. the expected number of column pairs calculated in this manner provides a null model for comparisons of the observed pairs. selective pressures on codons in selected viral genomes were evaluated. sequences for all viruses examined were obtained from the NIAID Virus Pathogen Resource Database and Analysis Resource. all sequences in these analyses must be colinear to maintain a consistent numbering system. phylogenetic trees are shown in Fig. S1q to ag in the supplemental material. alignments for use in the covariance algorithm were generated using MUSCLE. covariance scores were converted to a simple interaction file (SIF) format at the chosen OMES score cutoff using a Python script. positions of covariance were plotted using the PyMol Molecular Graphics System version 1.3 on the dengue virus env.

HCV 1a and 1b shuffled sequences were 1% of the number of covariances for the corresponding unshuffled alignments. this procedure was used to define the covariances in all subsequent alignments, and in all cases, a score cutoff of approximately 1.0 was used. 82 1,011 1.9 24.6 0.30 0.71 0.33 0.65 2.1 NAb Random Dengue virus 2 56 427 4.0 15.2 0.27 0.27 0.75 2.2 NA Random West Nile virus 26 115 2.9

generated from 47 HCV subtype 1a sequences (VHCorfs) and in the new networks generated from 300 1a sequences (300orfs) the covariance sets each formed a single network that contained >99% of the covariances. the network extended throughout the viral coding region, with similar numbers of covarying positions in the structural and nonstructural genes. value was 0.40 for subtype 1a and 0.59 for 1b. both networks had hub-and-spoke topologies in which there were no discrete subdomains. the phylogenetic split in the alignment led the OMES algorithm to identify all subtype-specific differences as covariances, resulting in >90,000 covariances. the major effect of increasing the number of sequences from 16 to 300 was to obtain greater sensitivity in identifying covariances. for the remaining analyses, we employed 100 randomly selected sequences if more than 100 were available or all sequences if fewer than 100 were available. the sequences must be representative of the viral genomes in circulation. density of this set of irrelevant networks was 0.001 and their average connectivity was 1.3. similar results were obtained when biologically irrelevant covariances from alignments of randomized sequences for other viruses were graphed. second, we generated 3,199 random associations among the 994 variable positions in the HCV 1a alignments of 100 sequences. these pairings created an intact network that looked superficially like the natural networks. linked positions mimic the number of edges in the alignment of 41 HEV sequences. the first level addresses the pairwise interactions (covariances), including their number and strength (S value) for HCV, about 10% of the positions covaried with relatively high S values that are indicative of relatively strong genetic linkages. n = 27; DV type 2 [DV2], n = 100; and WNV, n = 64) were downloaded and confirmed to be independent. the number of covariances in the alignments for these three viruses ranged from 26 (0.75% of the positions) in WNV to 82 (2.9% of the positions) in GBV-C. genome-wide covariance networks are widespread in the Flaviviridae. genome-wide covariance networks are widespread in the Flaviviridae. network topology was not conserved among the flaviviruses. the mean covariance scores for PV1, HAV, and HEV were moderate (S = 2.6, 3.0, and 2.0, respectively) but they were weak for CCHV (S = 1.5) the covariances for HAV, PV1, and CCHV each formed a single network that contained all or nearly all of the covariant positions. all positive-polarity single-stranded RNA viruses had extensive networks of intragenomic genetic dependencies extending through their structural and nonstructural genes. preliminary analyses of the available IV-A sequences revealed deep phylogenetic splits. covariance analyses using the entire data set revealed patterns dominated by the time-dependent phylogenetic divides. we restricted our analysis to 32 sequences from samples collected between 2005 and 2009. the sizes of the nodes are proportional to the number of edges that they contact. the nodes are color coded by segment, and the node numbers indicate the position in the concatenated gene alignments. the network parameters for the B19 network were similar to the parameters observed for the majority of the RNA viruses we examined. this indicates that covariance networks can exist in DNA viruses if they have sufficient genetic diversity. over half of its genome encodes two proteins simultaneously in overlapping frames. one hundred independent sequences each were obtained for HBV genotypes B, C, and D. amino acid sequences were extracted from their overlapping genomic positions. covariances within the alignments were identified at a 1% false-discovery rate. the presence of covariance networks was assessed as usual. each of the three HBV covariance sets formed a single network with high density that contained essentially all the covariances. the degree distribution plots for these networks failed to fit the power law (Fig. 6C), again due to a large number of highly connected nodes, leading to a random topology. if bottlenecking had generated the covariances, then the effective population size of the bottleneck must have been 3 to 6. if bottlenecking had generated the covariances, then the effective population size of the bottleneck must have been 3 to 6. dr. campo et al. examined amino acid covariance in 114 HCV 1b sequences and independently found that the covariant positions formed an extensive genome-wide hub-and-spoke network (11). dr. campo et al. examined amino acid covariance in 114 HCV 1b sequences. the networks contain less than 10% of the residues in each genome. 71/77 positively selected codons in HCV 1a and 7/9 in HBV genotype B were in the networks. these pressures differ from those on the genome as a whole. polarity 1 64 11,000 3,448 98.9 Hepatitis A virus HAV Picornaviridae Enterovirus ssRNA, + polarity 1 33 7,478 2,228 98.2

the variable positions in the alignment. shuffled sequences were forced into a colinear alignment with the original alignment. the presence of networks among the covariances in alignments of the 300 randomly selected HCV 1a and 1b sequences was assessed using Cytoscape. about 10% of the residue positions in the new alignments covaried with one or more other positions. 77 1.8 NA Random Hepatitis E

heterogeneity, and short characteristic path lengths. the majority of the nodes overlapped with the previously described Virahep-C networks. the phylogenetic trees were inspected to ensure that they lacked deep divisions. this led to pairwise identities among the viral groups that were comparable to the pairwise identities in HCV subtypes 1a and 1b. previous network analyses for HCV employed 16, 32, or 47 Virahep-C sequences each for subtypes 1a and 1b. network characteristics for HCV subtype 1a alignments of various sizes Alignment sizea No. of residue positions (nodes) No. of covarying

connectivity (6.4 versus 32.8), density (0.006 versus 0.17), centralization (0.009 versus 0.39) and average clustering coefficient (0.007 versus 0.59) than the natural network. this random covariance set failed to form a network. the highest level of complexity is network topology, which describes patterns among the connections within a network. for HCV, the topology was nonhierarchical hub and spoke, implying that residues found at the most highly connected nodes have a very strong influence on the identities of residues at the less connected nodes. the average covariance scores for GBV-C, DV2 and WNV were 1.9, 4.0, and 2.9, respectively, due in part to the increasing sensitivity associated with larger sequence sets. each of the other covariance sets formed a single genome-wide network containing essentially all of the covariances. genome-wide covariance networks are widespread in the Flaviviridae. networks were evaluated in four additional single-stranded positive-polarity RNA viruses. network topology was not conserved among the flaviviruses. the 51 positions forming 254 covariances within the VP1, VP2, VP3, VP4, 3C, and 3D proteins of PV1 were mapped onto the available crystal structures. all of these positions covaried with positions both in the same protein and in other proteins. all positive-polarity single-stranded RNA viruses examined had extensive networks of intragenomic genetic dependencies extending through their structural and nonstructural genes. three negative-polarity single-stranded RNA viruses were examined next. the RV alignments had 166 covariant positions (6.2% of the coding positions); 37 covariant positions were found for HDV (19% of the positions); 50 were found for IV-A (1.1% of the positions). the mean covariance scores were moderate for IV-A and weak for RV and HDV (S = 2.6, 1.7, and 1.6, respectively) covariance networks in negative-polarity virus genomes resembled the networks in most of the positive-polarity RNA viruses. each network was genome-wide, included essentially all covariances in a single network, and had a random topology. the subnetworks in the IV-A network were less distinct than the subnetworks formed by the other segmented virus we examined. hepatitis B virus is a partially double-stranded DNA virus with adequate genetic diversity. over half of its genome encodes two proteins simultaneously in overlapping frames. this unusual genetic organization may have impacted its intragenomic genetic interactions. variation at a single nucleotide affecting overlapping codons was manually eliminated. about 5% of the HBV amino acid positions covaried with one or more other positions at moderate to high average covariance scores (S = 2.3 to 4.7) the large majority (83 to 92%) of the covariances involved the viral polymerase, which accounts for about half the viral coding potential. c SAgs are the viral large, medium, and small surface antigen proteins. each of the three HBV covariance sets formed a single network with high density that contained essentially all the covariances. the degree distribution plots for these networks failed to fit the power law, again due to a large number of highly connected nodes. if bottlenecking had generated the covariances, then the effective population size of the bottleneck must have been 3 to 6. the deep divisions in the phylogenetic tree led to >40,000 covariances rather than the 3,199 seen with the natural HCV sequences. similar results were obtained when we modeled a bottleneck for HEV. campo et al. examined amino acid covariance in 114 HCV 1b sequences. they independently found that the covariant positions formed an extensive genome-wide hub-and-spoke network (11) these researchers explicitly examined the role selective pressures may have played in the origin of the network. DISCUSSION We and others previously identified genome-wide networks of covarying amino acids in HCV. these networks were interpreted to indicate that the viral genome evolved as a coordinated unit and to imply the existence of many previously unknown intra- and interprotein genetic dependencies. four observations resulted from this work. the network grew by addition of new nodes to the older nodes (accretion) (6, 10) the most highly connected nodes (hubs) are the most ancient interactions in the network, and that the hubs exert a disproportionately strong influence on the network. this implies that formation of amino acid covariances at most positions in the networks was influenced by preexisting genetic dependencies at the hub positions. differences in recombination rates are not the sole reason why the HCV network has a hub-and-spoke topology. despite the large number of highly connected nodes, none of them exert disproportionately large influences on the identities of residues at other sites in the network. covariance networks can provide inferences regarding viral biology. the viral covariance patterns contain substantial information that is not accessible by other methods. core dimers form both T=3 capsids and T=4 capsids. the second inference involves the spacer domain of the HBV polymerase. the polymerase is a reverse transcriptase in which the spacer appears to simply link the terminal protein domain to the catalytically active reverse transcriptase and RNase H domains. this implies that the spacer domain has a function, even if it may only accommodate conformational flexibility in the polymerase's interactions with other molecules. two regions of the reverse transcriptase domain appear to play an important role in the overall coordination of the polymerase. we speculate that they may be sites of compensatory adaptations to support conformational flexibility needed as the enzyme shifts from protein priming to DNA elongation. the largest of these subnetworks included VP1 residues 32, 221, and 215 and VP2 residues 140, 141, 169, and 173 along the capsid's 3-fold axis. this prediction can be tested by creating sets of disfavored residue pairs at network positions and then creating secondary mutations that restore compatible amino acid combinations. genome-wide covariance networks exist in all viruses examined. amino acid covariances were found in each of the 16 viral genomes we examined from 13 species and nine viral families. the vast majority of the covariances formed a single genome-wide network of genetic associations. the network grew by addition of new nodes to the older nodes (6, 10), that the most highly connected nodes are the most ancient interactions in the network. this implies that formation of amino acid covariances at most positions in the networks was influenced by preexisting genetic dependencies at the hub positions. this also indicates that the identities of residues at the hub positions disproportionately affect permissible genetic variation at a large number of other positions. the correlation between the mean pairwise identity in the sequence sets and the percentage of the genome found in the networks argues for a constraint model. however, the existing data are insufficient to resolve these models, and the causes for the random topology are not necessarily the same for all viruses. the causes for the random topology are not necessarily the same for all viruses. covariance network analysis can provide inferences regarding viral biology. the viral covariance patterns contain substantial information that is not accessible by other methods. five inferences that can be drawn from the HBV and PV1 covariance patterns are presented as examples of the utility of genome-wide covariance analyses. a reverse transcriptase is a reverse transcriptase in which the spacer appears to simply link the terminal protein domain to the catalytically active reverse transcriptase and RNase H domains. the large number of covariances in the spacer domain implies that it is under coordinate selective pressure with much of the rest of the genome. this implies that the spacer domain has a function, even if it may only be to accommodate conformational flexibility in the polymerase's interactions with the reverse transcrptase-RNase H interdomain interface must be 50 to 60 from the DNA polymerase active site (44) the polymerase has resisted crystallographic analyses, but this prediction could be tested through hydrodynamic analyses or cross-linking/mass spectrometry studies. adaptations have been reported for the PV capsid [50]. prediction is that receptor binding and viral infectivity would be impaired by the disfavored amino acid permutations. second-site restoration of compatible sets of residues at the network positions would restore receptor binding and infectivity."}
