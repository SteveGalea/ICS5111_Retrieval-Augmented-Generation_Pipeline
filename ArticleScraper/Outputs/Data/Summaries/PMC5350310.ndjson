{"summary": "millions of children under the age of 5 die annually due to respiratory infections. most commonly detected human respiratory viruses are human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV), influenza viruses (Flu), human rhinovirus (hRV), enterovirus (EV), human coronavirus (hCoV), human parainfluenza viruses (hPIV), human adenoviruses (hAdv) and human metapneumoviruses (hMPV) MERS-CoV is a lineage C betacoronavirus (betaCoVs) [19] which causes symptoms ranging from asymptomatic or mild upper respiratory tract infection to severe infections associated with acute pneumonia and occasional systemic infection. frquent sporadic cases of MERS-CoV and multiple hospital outbreaks have been reported in several cities in the Arabian Peninsula. swabs were collected from all symptomatic outpatients at all ages. all swabs were collected in virus transport media, stored at 80\u00b0C. RNA extraction was carried out using QIAamp Viral RNA mini kit. cDNA was incubated at 85\u00b0C for 5 min to inactivate enzymes. cDNA was stored at 80\u00b0C until use. all samples were tested with Infiniti RVP plus assay. onuclease I (EXO) (GE Life Sciences, USA) and 0.5 l of titanium Taq polymerase (Invitrogen, USA) to each PCR product. mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C, followed by 10 min at 94\u00b0C and a final hold at 4\u00b0C. samples were then loaded in the Infiniti Plus analyzer for testing with RVP plus assay. a total of 182 samples were collected from five healthcare centers in jazan province, Saudi Arabia, between November 2013 and January 2014. swabs were collected from all symptomatic outpatients at all ages who presented with symptoms of ARTI to these five healthcare centers. 10 l of 2x first-strand reaction buffer and 2 l of enzyme mix were added to the mixture and incubated at 25\u00b0C for 5 min. cDNA was stored at 80\u00b0C until use. cDNA was stored at 80\u00b0C until use. PCR products were cleaned up by adding 3 l of Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase (SAP), 0.75 l of Exonuclease I (EXO) and 0.5 l of titanium Taq polymerase to each PCR product. mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C, followed by 10 min at 94\u00b0C and a final hold at 4\u00b0C. the 2 test, the Fisher exact test, or the Z test was applied to evaluate the difference between proportions or to assess whether there were any associations between the proportions. a two-tailed probability value p0.05 was considered statistically significant. virus were more commonly detected in healthcare center 3 (48%, 36/75) and healthcare center number 4 (29.3%, 22/75) compared to the remaining 3 centers. all the samples collected in this study were first tested for MERS-CoV. coinfections include all viruses detected from the 13 coinfected patients (2 13) hRV (40.9%, 36/88), hCoV-OC43 (15.9%, 14/88), FluA (13.6%, 12/88), hRSV-B (10.2%, 9/88), and hAdv (5.7%, 5/88). hCoV-OC43 (19.2%, 5/26), FluA (19.2%, 5/26), hAdv (15.4%, 4/26), hRSV-A (7.7%, 2/26), hRSV-B (7.7%, 2/26), and EV (3.9%, 1/26) the remaining 6 coinfections were detected once and were due to unique combination of respiratory viruses. 0 0 0 1 (100) 0 hRSV-B 7 5 (19.2) 2 (12.5) 0 0 0 4 (57.1) 3 (42.9) FluA 7 2 (7.7) 1 (6.3) 2 (13.33) 2 (15.4) 0 5 (71.4) 2 (28.6) FluB 2 1 (3.8) 0 1 (6.66) 0 0 1 (50) EV 2 (2 (7.7) 0 0 0 1 (100) 0 h clinical symptoms in patients with single infections and coinfection. clinical symptoms in infected and noninfected patients. clinical symptoms in infected patients. epidemiological data Of the samples tested, 41.2% (75/182) were positive for one or more viruses (Table 1) including 72% (54/75) males and 28% (21/75) females. non-Saudis represented 16% (12/75) of all the positive cases.
