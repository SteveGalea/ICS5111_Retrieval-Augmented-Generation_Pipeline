{"summary": "in 2002/3, SARS-Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in the region of southern china. it quickly spread to twenty-seven countries, infecting 8,098 people with 774 deaths. it was declared the first global pandemic of the 21st century. despite recent efforts, there are several notable gaps in our understanding of CoV diversity. foremost, our knowledge of CoVs in resource-limited countries is poor. there has been little effort to understand evolutionary and ecological drivers of CoV diversity on a global scale. the biogeography of bats has shaped the diversity of CoVs globally. the biogeography of bats suggests there could be regional variation in host switching and the risk for zoonotic emergence. all human activities were conducted with permission from local authorities and under the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of California, Davis. all human activities were reviewed and approved by the UC Davis Institutional Review Board (IRB) the best-fitting model of nucleotide substitution for each dataset was selected by Akaike\u2019s Information Criterion (AIC) for both alignments, the general time reversible model with a gamma distribution of rate heterogeneity was the best-fitting model. a network model was constructed to show the distribution of viral sequence clusters across all species. networks were plotted using the force-directed algorithm ForceAtlas2 (Jacomy et al. 2014) a cophylogeny program uses a parameter-adaptive approach to estimate an appropriate cost scheme without any prior value assignment. we used Jane with the default pre-determined cost scheme where cospeciation is the null hypothesis and, therefore, the \u2018cheapest\u2019 event, with the assumption that host switching would theoretically be more costly than genetic drift. 'host switching' refers specifically to viral lineages that have moved into a host belonging to another genus or family, and'sharing' to indicate a viral lineage that has moved into a different host species of the same genus. 'host switching' is consistent with current conventions of taxonomic hierarchy, and verified that the mean genetic distance between host species is consistent between regions. analysis was repeated to explore variation based on bat family (independent variable) some families only possessed one type of event, which would introduce quasi-complete separation into the GEE model. but the numbers of bat species within these excluded families were very small (5) compared to the overall number of bat species for the whole study. binary logistic regression models were used to evaluate significant variables, restricting analyses to species for which 50 individuals were tested. a robust estimation of standard error was calculated by clustering by individual Animal Identification number to account for non-independence of multiple tests from the same animal using STATA 13.1, SE. chi square tests used to evaluate whether viral sub-clade and host family were independent of each other. spatial distribution data on all bat species belonging to associated families was obtained from the international Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) all samples from swabs (e.g. oral, urine, rectal), fluids (e.g. saliva), and tissues were collected into (1) NucliSens\u00ae Lysis Buffer (bioM\u00e9rieux, Inc., Marcy-I\u2019\u00c9toile, France) all human activities were conducted with permission from local authorities and under the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of California, Davis. 2.3 Phylogenetics Coronavirus sequences from the Quan and Watanabe datasets were aligned with reference sequences collected from GenBank using MUSCLE (Edgar 2004), followed by manual alignment in Se-Al v2.0a11. the best-fitting model of nucleotide substitution for each dataset was selected by Akaike\u2019s Information Criterion using jModeltest v2.1.5. the Shannon index was chosen over the Gini\u2013Simpson index because it does not place disproportionate weight on dominant species. effective number of viruses and bats in each cell was then correlated using Kendall\u2019s tau. phylogeny The Jane (Conow et al. 2010) software tool was used for cophylogenetic reconstructions. this approach applies an a priori \u2018cost scheme\u2019 to different evolutionary events in order to test the degree of congruence between two trees (virus and host) these \u2018events\u2019 include cospeciation, duplication, host switching, and failure to diverge (or sorting) the topology of the virus tree was inferred from the topology of the full tree for consistency. for each reconstruction, the most recent evolutionary event leading to a virus\u2013host association was recorded. we also distinguished between two potential types of host switching. analysis was repeated to explore variation based on bat family (independent variable) some families only possessed one type of event, which would introduce quasi-complete separation into the GEE model, so they were excluded from the corresponding models. 2.8 Factors associated with CoV positivity. only bat data were analyzed for factors associated with positivity. among aged bats 7,385 were adults, 1,029 were sub-adults and 8 were neonates. the model fit for each region was evaluated using the Hosmer\u2013Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test and pseudo R2 values. for each viral clade, spatial distribution data on all bat species belonging to associated families was obtained from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) 91 Non-Human Primates 3,470 4 2 Rodents and Shrews 3,387 11 7 Humans 1,124 2 2 Total 19,192 1,082 100a aNote: Numbers do not total as two viruses were detected in two taxa. partial sequences were obtained from two non-overlapping fragments of the orf1ab gene, yielding 654 sequences for the \u2018Quan\u2019 region. e regions within the orf1ab are separated by >3,000 nucleotides. a bimodal distribution was observed and a cutoff of 90% sequence identity used to separate sequences from both the Watanabe (Panel A) and Quan (Panel B) assays into discrete viral taxa. virus in non-human primates from Nepal were detected by four different laboratories. no rodent samples were processed at the same time. avian-associated infectious bronchitis virus-like sequences (IBV) in bats and a closely related virus (PREDICT_CoV-49) in non-human primates from Bangladesh. grid cells where bats were sampled are numbered in each region. Alpha diversity for virus (Panel B) and host (Panel C) were correlated. darker cells indicate higher alpha diversity (i.e. more viral or host taxa) in each grid cell. despite fewer host-switching events in Latin America, there was a concomitant increase in virus sharing (intra-genus transmission) this suggests that viruses are still switching hosts in Latin America but preferentially move between closely related species. in africa and Asia viruses cross between more distantly related species. 3.3 Estimated number of CoVs in bats A large number of host (bat) species in our study were negative for CoV (n = 197), but none of these species were sampled extensively. the average number of CoVs per species was 2.67 (std = 1.38), thus accounting for the likely scenario that some species will have more viruses and others less. the best model included specimen type, bat family, season, and animal\u2013human interface. season was not included in the top model for Latin America. Specimen type was highly associated with CoV positivity. samples collected during the dry season more likely to test positive in Africa and Asia. age datasets were a subset of regional datasets as age class was not determined for all individuals. numbers in bold are statically significant for P 0.05. 1 2.18 6.18 Hipposideridae 1.00 Season Dry 1.49 0.03 1.03 2.16 Wet 1.00 Interface Animal use 3.30

rhinolophid and hipposiderid bats and 2c with vespertilionid bats. map suggests there are hotspots of 2c diversity in regions not covered in this study (e.g. Europe) panel D indicates the potential distribution of 2d viruses based on the distribution of pteropid bats. groups that shared less than 90% identity to a known sequence were labeled sequentially as PREDICT_CoV-1, -2, -3 etc. groups that shared 90% identity to a sequence already in GenBank were considered strains of a known virus. based on these criteria, 100 discrete viral taxa were identified. dRp fragments for both the Quan (Panel A) and Watanabe (Panel B) assays are collapsed into clades. number of sequences for each taxon is indicated in parentheses. both trees were rooted using the related Breda virus. we highlight the detection of avian-associated infectious bronchitis virus-like sequences (IBV) in bats and a closely related virus (PREDICT_CoV-49) in non-human primates from Bangladesh, as well as porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) in bats. beta diversity was also correlated between virus (Panel D) and host (Panel E), and differentiated into three discrete communities by region. shding indicates either viruses (in red) or hosts (in blue) are shared between two corresponding grid cells. only Africa and Asia are connected by two shared viruses (HKU9 and PREDICT_CoV-35) found in species from both continents. the cost scheme calculated in CoRePA was 0.7 for host switching and 0.1 for co-speciation. host switching was the dominant evolutionary event (Panel A) when separated by region, host switching remained dominant in Africa and Asia. a large number of host (bat) species in our study were negative for CoV (n = 197) none of these species were sampled extensively. we estimated the average number of CoVs per species to be 2.67 (std = 1.38), thus accounting for the likely scenario that some species will have more viruses and others less. feces and fecal swabs were significantly more likely to test positive than other specimen types in all regions. season was also significant, with samples collected during the dry season more likely to test positive in Africa and Asia than those collected during the wet season. males were slightly more likely to be CoV positive in Africa. 2.41 Pteropodidae 3.84 0.001 2.27 6.49 Molossidae 1.00 Season Dry 2.42 0.001 1.79 3.25 Wet 1.00

Feces/rectal swab 154 individuals estimate an average of one CoV will be detected (95% CI 136\u2013177) with 397 individuals, we estimate that up to five CoVs will be detected (95% CI 351\u2013458) panel A shows potential hotspots for CoVs based on the distribution of bats worldwide. location of alpha CoV sequences from this study are shown in black and beta CoV sequences in blue, indicating there is no geographical bias. we surveyed the diversity of CoVs from twenty countries in Latin America, Africa, and Asia to identify global factors driving viral diversity. in total, we identified sequences from 100 discrete phylogenetic clusters, ninety-one of which were found in bats. our data suggest that the diversity of bat CoVs has been driven primarily by host ecology. proportionally fewer events in Latin America compared with Africa or Asia. we suggest this finding could reflect regional differences in the risk of disease emergence. if we assume that the risk of spillover to humans reflects the taxonomic distances that CoVs are able to jump. we suggest future surveillance efforts should consider the number of samples carefully and include up to 400 individuals (of either sex) per species in order to maximize the chance of detecting all CoVs. we also recommend that feces (or rectal swabs) followed by saliva should be prioritized if resources are limited and all sample types cannot be processed. the diversity of CoV sequences detected is almost certainly biased by our sampling effort. a small number of species were sampled abundantly, thus maximizing our chances of finding a CoV towards the more abundantly sampled species. however, most were under-sampled (232/282 with 50 individuals) the USAID PREDICT project first had to establish a strategy for viral discovery in twenty different countries, many of which had no prior capacity to do this work at all. cPCR has demonstrated the particular and considerable strengths of cPCR as an affordable screening and discovery tool in resource-poor settings, where HTS is still largely unsupported. most of the putative viruses detected in this study are unlikely to pose any threat to humans. studies such as this are intended to advance our understanding of the fundamental biology of viruses, not to create alarm or incite the retaliatory culling of bats. such actions often have unanticipated consequences; can even enhance disease transmission."}
