{"summary": "there are 12,500 new cases of SCI each year in north America (1). more than 90% of SCI cases are traumatic and caused by incidences such as traffic accidents, violence, sports or falls (2). men are mostly affected during their early and late adulthood (3rd and 8th decades of life). women are at higher risk during their adolescence (15\u201319 years) and 7th decade of their lives (2). the estimated life-time cost of a SCI patient is $2.35 million per patient. a wealth of research has been conducted in preclinical and clinical SCI. the most common form of primary injury is impact plus persistent compression. blast injury is the common cause of SCI in battlefield that usually involves multiple segments of the spinal cord (14). compared to civilian SCI, blast injury results in higher severity scores and is associated with longer hospital stays (15). lower lumbar burst fractures and lumbosacral dissociation happen more frequently in combat injuries. grade B was the most severe SCI with complete loss of sensory and motor function below the level of injury. patients in Grade C and D had different degrees of motor function preservation and Grade E represented normal sensory and motor function. lack of clear distinction between Grades C and D led to its replacement by other scoring systems. the neurological level of injury (NLI) is defined as \"the most caudal neurological level at which all sensory and motor functions are normal\" at thoracic and lumbar levels, each vertebra overlays a spinal cord segment one or two levels below and as the result, a T11 vertebral burst fracture results in neurological deficit at and below the adult spinal cord. neurological outcomes are generally determined at 72 h after injury using ASIA scoring system (20, 27) one important predictor of functional recovery is to determine whether the injury was incomplete or complete. most of the functional recovery occurs during the first 3 months. complete tetraplegic patients with cervical SCI can regain antigravity muscle function in 27% of cases when their initial muscle strength is 0 on a 5-point scale. however, the rate of regaining antigravity muscle strength at one caudal level below the injury increases to 97% when the patients have initial muscle strength of 1\u20132 on a 5-point scale. failure to detect sensory preservation at sacral segments results in inaccurate assessment of prognosis (20). most common form of primary injury is impact plus persistent compression. impact alone with transient compression is observed less frequently but most commonly in hyperextension injuries (8). laceration and transection injuries can occur through missile injuries, severe dislocations, or sharp bone fragment dislocations. in complete SCI, neurological assessments show no spared motor or sensory function below the level of injury (4). several scoring systems have been employed for clinical classification of neurological deficits following SCI. the first classification system, \u201cFrankel Grade,\u201d was developed by Frankel and colleagues in 1969. ASIA scoring system was developed in 1984 by the American Spinal Cord Injury Association and has been updated over time to improve its reliability. the first step in ASIA system is to identify the neurological level of injury (NLI) the injury, AIS score can be C or D (20) the majority of muscle groups below the level of the injury exhibit strength level of 3 or higher (for more details see Figure 1). the AIS is scored D when the majority of the muscle groups below the level of the injury exhibit strength level of 3 or higher (for more details see Figure 1). an NLI below T9 is associated with 38% chance of regaining some lower extremity function (29) in patients with complete paraplegia, the chance of recovery to an incomplete status is only 4%. only half of these patients regaining bladder and bowel control (29) an animal model should have several characteristics including its relevance to the pathophysiology of human SCI, reproducibility, availability, and its potential to generate various severities of injury. small rodents are the most frequently employed animals in SCI studies due to their availability, ease of use and cost-effectiveness compared to primates and larger non-primate models of SCI. mouse SCI studies show the presence of fibroblast-like cells expressing fibronectin, collagen, CD11b, CD34, CD13, and CD45 within the lesion core of chronic SCI. in rats, infiltration of neutrophils, the first responders, peaks at 6 h post injury, followed by a significant decline at 24\u201348 h after SCI (48). small and large animal models of SCI have limitations in their ability to predict the outcome in human SCI. a significant effect from an experimental treatment may not be reproducible in clinical settings due to high variability and heterogeneity in human populations and their injuries. however, the majority of these trials failed to reproduce the same efficacy in human SCI. basso et al.

(37) Heimburger (72) Complete transection A wide variety of small and large animals 1990s Complete transection Reproducible, consistent, easy to perform the following sections will provide an overview on the available SCI models that are developed based on injury mechanisms, their specifications and relevance to human SCI. transection models are specifically suitable for studying axonal regeneration or developing biomaterial scaffolds to bridge the gap between proximal and distal stamps. the NYU impactor was later renamed to multicenter animal spinal cord injury study (MASCIS) impactor. the most recent version, MACIS III, was introduced in 2012 and included both electromagnetic control and digital recording of the impact parameters. inability to control duration of impact and \u201cweight bounce\u201d that could cause multiple impacts have been known limitations of MASCIS impactors. impactor devices are available for small and large animals such as mice, rats, marmosets, cats, and pigs (51, 82) the most commonly used compression model of SCI in rat and mice (51, 61, 62, 83) clip compression model was first used in 1991 for induction of SCI in guinea pigs. in this method, a calibrated forceps with a spacer is used to compress the spinal cord bilaterally (51) this model lacks the initial impact and contusive injury. secondary injury can be temporally divided into acute, sub-acute, and chronic phases. sub-acute phase begins immediately following SCI and includes apoptosis, demyelination of surviving axons, wallerian degeneration, axonal dieback, matrix remodeling, and evolution of a glial scar around the injury site. astrocyte-derived macrophages occupy epicenter of injury to scavenge tissue debris. monocyte-derived macrophages produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, autoantibodies reactive oxygen and nitrogen species that contribute to tissue degeneration. the glial scar and its associated matrix surround the injury epicenter and create a cellular and biochemical zone. a mature longstanding glial scar and upregulation of matrix chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans are shown to inhibit axonal regeneration/sprouting and cell differentiation in subacute and chronic phases. hypovolemia and hemodynamic shock in SCI patients due to excessive bleeding result in compromised spinal cord perfusion and ischemia (93) cellular necrosis and release of cytoplasmic content increase the extracellular level of glutamate causing glutamate excitotoxicity (93, 101) re-establishment of blood flow in ischemic tissue leads to further damage through generating free radicals and eliciting an inflammatory response (93, 102) that will be discussed in this review. a long-lasting abnormal increase in Ca2+ concentration in cytosol, mitochondria or endoplasmic reticulum has detrimental consequences for the cell. mitochondrial calcium overload can cause apoptotic or necrotic cell death (113) in neurons, during glutamate induced excitotoxicity, NMDA receptor over-activity leads to mitochondrial calcium overload, which can cause apoptotic or necrotic cell death (113). calcium overload also impedes mitochondrial respiration and results in ATP depletion disabling Na+/K+ ATPase. excess intracellular Na+ reverses the activity of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger allowing more Ca+ influx. increased Na+ concentration over-activates Na+/H+ exchanger causing a rise in intracellular H+. PAR polymers produced by PARP activity induce the release of apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) from mitochondria and induce cell death (114). acidosis caused by SCI results in the release of intracellular iron from ferritin and transferrin (93). lipid peroxidation leads to Na+/K+ ATPase dysfunction that exacerbates the intracellular Na+ overload (141). lipid peroxidation leads to significant RNS associated oxidative damage following SCI (93). nitrate tyrosine residues of amino acids to form 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) necrosis is a receptor-mediated process. it is induced downstream of the TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) and is dependent on the activity of the receptor interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) and RIPK3. necroptosis is a regulator of the innate immune response involved in both inflammation and cell death. apoptosis is the most studied mechanism of cell death after SCI. it occurs in cells that survive the primary injury but endure enough insult to activate their apoptotic pathways. in rat SCI, apoptosis happens as early as 4 h after the injury. apoptosis occurs due to injury induced Ca2+ influx, which activates caspases and calpain; enzymes involved in breakdown of cellular proteins (7). the death of neurons and oligodendrocytes in remote areas from the lesion epicenter can be mediated through cytokines such as TNF-, free radical damage and excitotoxicity. autophagy is activated and limits cellular loss (177, 178) neurons with dysregulated autophagy exhibit higher expression of caspase 12. blocking autophagy has been associated with neurodegenerative diseases. autophagy promotes cell survival through elimination of toxic proteins and damaged mitochondria. inflammation is more pronounced in the acute phase of injury, but continues in subacute and chronic phase. inflammation is more pronounced in the acute phase of injury, but continues in subacute and chronic phase and may persist for the remainder of a patients' life. Activated microglia/macrophages release pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. they present antigens to CD4+ T cells causing activation of antigen specific effector T cells. autoantibodies cause neurodegeneration through FcR mediated phagocytosis. chemokines mediate chemokine production and recruitment of neutrophils through an IL-1R1-Myd88 pathway (202). astrocytes also produce anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as TGF- and IL-10, which can promote a pro-regenerative M2-like phenotype in the injured spinal cord. TGF- signaling in astrocytes has been implicated in modulation of neuroinflammation through inhibition of NF-B activity and nuclear translocation. increase in STAT3 phosphorylation enhances astrocytic scar formation and restricts the expansion of inflammatory cells in mouse SCI. detrimental signaling pathways in astrocytes are known to be activated by cytokines, sphingolipids and neurotrophins (200) simulated neutrophils release IL-1 receptor antagonist that can exert neuroprotective effects following SCI (217) ablation of neutrophils results in altered expression of cytokines and chemokines and downregulation of growth factors such as fibroblast growth factors. microglia/macrophages populate the injured spinal cord within 2\u20133 days post-SCI. macrophages and microglia share many functions and immunological markers. microglia are resident immune cells of the CNS that originate from yolk sac. macrophages are derived from blood monocytes, which originate from myeloid progeny in the bone marrow (222, 223) some evidence show that Proinflammatory M1-like microglia/macrophages can be induced by exposure to Th1 specific cytokine, interferon (IFN)- (224, 230) Moreover, the SCI microenvironment appears to drive an M1-like proinflammatory phenotype in macrophages after injury (231). IL-10 knock-out mice show higher production of pro-inflammatory and oxidative stress mediators after SCI (242\u2013244) lack of IL-10 is also correlated with upregulated levels of pro-apoptotic factors such as Bax and reduced expression of anti-apoptotic factors such as Bcl-2 (245). adaptive immune response requires a complex signaling process in T cells elicited by antigen presenting cells (250) T and B lymphocytes adopt different phenotypes and contribute to both injury and repair processes. T cells can exert direct toxic effects on neurons and glial cells (194, 252) f cells contribute to tissue damage through production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. f cells promote activation and differentiation of antigen specific B cells to autoantibody producing plasma cells that contribute to tissue damage after SCI (255). cic spinal cord (T3) suppresses the antibody production, a mid-thoracic (T9) injury has no effect on B cell antibody production. an increase in corticosterone in serum and elevation of splenic norepinephrine found to be responsible for the suppression of B cell function acutely following SCI. this suggests a critical role for sympathetic innervation of peripheral lymphoid tissues in regulating B cell response following CNS injury. fibroblasts contribute to the production of fibronectin, collagen, and laminin in the ECM of the inured spinal cord. perivascular pericytes and fibroblasts migrate to the injury site and form a fibrotic core in the scar which matures within 2 weeks post-injury. the astrocytic glial scar has been found within the injured human spinal cord up to 42 years after the injury (267) astrocytes proliferate and mobilize to the site of injury and form a mesh like structure of intermingled filamentous processes around the injury epicenter (284, 285) a number of inhibitory molecules have been associated with activated astrocytes and their secreted products such as proteoglycans and Tenascin-C (288). CSPGs are well-known for their contribution to the inhibitory role of the glial scar in axonal regeneration (290\u2013295), sprouting (296\u2013299), conduction (300\u2013302), and remyelination (241, 303\u2013307) CSPG upregulation was found to be mediated by the activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and mTOR axis (313) further studies are required to confirm these findings. the first successful attempt on improving axon outgrowth and/or sprouting by enzymatic degradation of CSPGs using chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) in a rat SCI model was published in 2002. a study by sofroniew's and colleagues has shown that spontaneous axon regrowth failed to happen following the ablation or prevention of astrocytic scar in acute and chronic SCI. they demonstrated that when the intrinsic ability of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons for growth was enhanced by pre-conditioning injury. however, when astrocyte scarring was attenuated, the pre-conditioned/growth factor stimulated DRG neurons showed a reduced ability for emerging evidence has identified CSPGs as an inhibitor of oligodendrocytes. replacement of oligodendrocytes is important repair process in MS. CSPGs limit recruitment of NPCs and OPCs to the lesion. peptide (ISP) and intracellular LAR peptide (ILP) facilitates axon regeneration following SCI (327, 330) inhibition of RPTP results in significant improvement in locomotion and bladder function associated with serotonergic re-innervation below the level of injury in rat SCI (327. CSPGs induce caspase-3 mediated apoptosis in NPCs and OPCs in vitro and in oligo early studies in sCI described preventing CSPG formation with xyloside treatment at the time of injury results in poor functional outcome. manipulation of CSPGs at 2 days after SCI was beneficial for functional recovery (333). these differential outcomes were associated with modulatory role of CSPGs in regulating the response of macrophages/microglia. a study by Metz and colleagues compared the functional and anatomical outcomes of rat contusive injuries and human chronic SCI (42). high resolution MRI assessments identified that SCI-induced neuroanatomical changes such as spinal cord atrophy were significantly correlated with the electrophysiological and functional outcomes in both rat and human contusive injuries (42). mice show different histopathology than human SCI in which the lesion site is filled with dense fibrous connective-like tissue (43\u201346). in rats, T cell infiltration occurs between 3 and 7 days post injury. in mice, T cell infiltration is not detected until 14 days post injury. in rats, T cell infiltration is not detected until 14 days post injury. in mice, their number doubles between 2 and 6 weeks post injury. larger animals provide the opportunity to refine promising therapeutic strategies prior to testing in human SCI. however, their higher cost, need for specialized facilities and small subject size have limited their use in SCI research (50) stability of spinal cord is not required, can inflict both contusion and compression injuries, different injury severity, clinically relevant Need for calibration due to the loss of force after repeated use. impact parameters not recordable Marcol et al.

(74) inman et transection models are valuable for investigation of nerve grafting, plasticity and where a comparison between injured and non-injured pathways is needed. however, these models lead to a less severe injury and higher magnitude of spontaneous recovery rendering them less suitable for development and evaluation of new therapies (51). there are currently three types of devices that produce contusion injury in animal models: weight-drop apparatus, electromagnetic impactor, and an air gun device (51). er can be immediately retracted upon transmitting a desired force to the spinal cord (51). a limitation with IH impactors is unreliability of their clamps in holding the spinal column firmly during the impact that can cause inconsistent parenchymal injury and neurological deficits. closing force is applied to the spinal cord for a specific duration of time (usually 1 min) to induce a contusive-compressive injury (51). the severity of injury can be calibrated and modified by adjusting the force of the clip and the duration of compression (51). compression and contusion models are considered to be the most relevant and commonly employed methods for understanding the secondary injury mechanisms and therapeutic development for SCI. transection models are specifically suitable for studying axonal regeneration or developing biomaterial scaffolds to bridge the gap between proximal and distal stamps of the severed spinal cord (51). the original NYU impactor included a metal rod of specific weight (10 g) that could be dropped on the exposed spinal cord from a specific height to induce SCI (51). this model allowed induction of a defined severity of SCI by adjusting the height, which the rod fell on the spinal cord (81). the NYU impactor was later renamed to multicenter animal spinal cord injury study (MASCIS) impactor. a modified version of the OSU impactor was developed in 2000 for use in mice (43) however, the device is limited by its inability to determine the precise initial contact point with the spinal cord due to displacement of CSF upon loading the device (51). MASCIS, IH and OSU impactor devices have been extensively and successfully employed to induce SCI. compression model has several advantages compared to contusion models. clip compression model provides contusion and compression simultaneously both dorsally and ventrally. clip compression model mimics most common form of human SCI. secondary injury is referred to a series of cellular, molecular and biochemical phenomena that continue to self-destruct spinal cord tissue and impede neurological recovery following SCI. the term of secondary injury is still being used in the field and is still being used in the field. pathophysiology of traumatic spinal cord injury. astrocytes and microglia infiltrate the spinal cord during sub-acute phase. axonal demyelination followed by spontaneous remyelination. the astrocytic glial scar limits the spread of neuroinflammation from the lesion site to the healthy tissue. but establishment of a mature longstanding glial scar and upregulation of matrix chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) are shown to inhibit axonal regeneration/sprouting and cell differentiation in subacute and chronic phases. cellular necrosis and release of cytoplasmic content increase the extracellular level of glutamate causing glutamate excitotoxicity. re-establishment of blood flow in ischemic tissue leads to further damage through generating free radicals and eliciting an inflammatory response. a long-lasting abnormal increase in Ca2+ concentration in cytosol, mitochondria or endoplasmic reticulum has detrimental consequences for the cell. mitochondria play a central role in calcium dependent neuronal death (113) in neurons, during glutamate induced excitotoxicity, NMDA receptor over-activity leads to mitochondrial calcium overload, which can cause apoptotic or necrotic cell death (113). administration of NMDA receptor antagonist (MK-801) shortly following SCI has been associated with improved functional recovery and reduced edema (121). mitochondrial calcium overload also impedes mitochondrial respiration and results in ATP depletion disabling Na+/K+ ATPase and increasing intracellular Na+ (119, 122\u2013124) reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS) produced by the activity of NOX and ETC activates cytosolic poly (ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) PARP consumes and depletes NAD+ causing failure of glycolysis, ATP depletion and cell death. oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+ gives rise to more superoxide radicals (134) lipid peroxidation leads to ionic imbalance through destabilizing cellular membranes. lipid peroxidation leads to Na+/K+ ATPase dysfunction. amino acids subject to significant RNS associated oxidative damage following SCI. necrosis occurs due to a multitude of factors including accumulation of toxic blood components (151), glutamate excitotoxicity and ionic imbalance (152), ATP depletion (153), pro-inflammatory cytokine release by neutrophils and lymphocytes (154, 155), and free radical formation (142, 156\u2013158). necrosis was conventionally viewed as instantaneous energy-independent non-programmed cell death (142, 156). lysosomal damage can potentiate necroptosis by promoting RIPK1 and RIPK3 accumulation (161). Interestingly, inhibition of necroptosis by necrostatin-1, a RIPK1 inhibitor, improves functional outcomes after SCI (150). apoptosis is the most studied mechanism of cell death after SCI. the intrinsic pathway is regulated through a balance between intracellular pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins. the death of neurons and oligodendrocytes in remote areas can be mediated through cytokines such as TNF-, free radical damage and excitotoxicity. autophagy starts with the formation of an autophagosome around the proteins and organelles that are tagged for autophagy (176). fusion of the phagosome with a lysosome form an autolysosome that begins a recycling process (176). autophagy is activated and limits cellular loss (177, 178) inflammation can be both beneficial and detrimental following SCI. there are multiple cell types involved in the inflammatory response following injury. inflammation is more pronounced in the acute phase of injury, but continues in subacute and chronic phase. Treg and Breg suppress the activation of antigen specific CD4+ T cells. Activated microglia/macrophages release pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. teff cells stimulate antigen specific B cells to undergo clonal expansion. Astrocytes react acutely to CNS injury by increasing cytokine and chemokine production (202) they mediate chemokine production and recruitment of neutrophils through an IL-1R1-Myd88 pathway (202) chemokines are produced by astrocytes and microglia. astrocytes also produce anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as TGF- and IL-10. gp130, a member of IL-6 cytokine family, activates SHP2/Ras/Erk signaling cascade in astrocytes. STAT3 is another key signaling pathway in astrocytes with beneficial properties in neuroinflammation. increased STAT3 phosphorylation enhances astrocytic scar formation and restricts the expansion of inflammatory cells in mouse SCI. neutrophils contribute to phagocytosis and clearance of tissue debris (48) they release inflammatory cytokines, proteases and free radicals that degrade ECM, activate astrocytes and microglia and initiate neuroinflammation (48). they release inflammatory cytokines, proteases and free radicals that degrade ECM, activate astrocytes and microglia and initiate neuroinflammation (48). the population of microglia/macrophages reaches its peak at 7\u201310 days post-injury in mouse SCI, followed by a decline in the subacute and chronic phases (20, 220) microglia are resident immune cells of the CNS that originate from yolk sac during the embryonic period (221) macrophages are derived from blood monocytes, which originate from myeloid progeny in the bone marrow (222, 223) proinflammatory M1-like microglia/macrophages can be induced by exposure to Th1 specific cytokine, interferon (IFN)- (224, 230). increased level of the proinflammatory cytokine, TNF-, and intracellular accumulation of iron drives an M1-like proinflammatory phenotype. pro-regenerative M2-like microglia/macrophages are polarized by Th2 cytokines, IL-4 and IL-13 and exhibit a high level of IL-10, TGF-, and arginase-1. IL-10 knock-out mice show higher production of pro-inflammatory and oxidative stress mediators after SCI (245) T and B lymphocytes play pivotal role in adaptive immune response after SCI (194). lymphocytes infiltrate the injured spinal cord acutely during the first week of injury. adaptive immune response requires complex signaling process in T cells elicited by antigen presenting cells (250) increased activity of autoreactive Teff cells contributes to tissue damage through production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. increased activity of autoreactive Teff cells contributes to tissue damage through production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. studies in murine SCI have shown that SCI can suppress B cell activation and antibody production (261). injury to upper thoracic spinal cord (T3) suppresses the antibody production, but a mid-thoracic (T9) injury has no effect on B cell antibody production (262). ytes are not considered an immune cell per se; however, they play pivotal roles in the neuroinflammatory processes in the CNS. in normal CNS, astrocytes play major roles in maintaining CNS homeostasis. they contribute to the structure and function of blood-brain-barrier. ligand 1 (CXCL1), and CXCL2 are produced by astrocytes. they enhance the recruitment of neutrophils and pro-inflammatory macrophages. astrocytes also produce anti-inflammatory cytokines. NF-B enhances expression of pro-inflammatory mediators, activation of oxidative pathways and exacerbation of neuroinflammation. neutrophils contribute to phagocytosis and clearance of tissue debris (48) they release inflammatory cytokines, proteases and free radicals that degrade ECM, activate astrocytes and microglia. microglia/macrophages populate the injured spinal cord within 2\u20133 days post-SCI. microglia/macrophages reaches its peak at 7\u201310 days post-injury in mouse SCI. microglia are resident immune cells of the CNS that originate from yolk sac during the embryonic period (221) macrophages and microglia play a beneficial role in CNS regeneration. they promote the repair process by expression of growth promoting factors. they promote the repair process by expression of growth promoting factors such as nerve growth factor (NGF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) and thrombospondin (225, 226) M1-like macrophages are associated with higher expression of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) and increased EAE severity and tissue damage. addition of activated M1-like macrophages to dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neuron cultures leads to axonal retraction. IL-10 polarized M2 microglia show enhanced capacity for phagocytosis (241). a balance between proinflammatory M1 and pro-regenerative M2 macrophage/microglia response is beneficial for the repair of SCI (249) gene elimination of T cells (in athymic nude rats) or pharmacological inhibition of T cells (using cyclosporine A and tacrolimus) leads to improved tissue preservation and functional recovery after SCI (194, 253) signifying impact of T cells in SCI pathophysiology and repair. serum IgM level increases acutely followed by an elevation in the levels of IgG1 and IgG2a at later time-points. autoantibody production contributes to CNS injury through pro-inflammatory cytokines that stimulate and maintain the activation states of Teff cells. glial scar is a multifactorial phenomenon that is contributed f several populations in the injured spinal cord including activated astrocytes, NG2+ oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), microglia, fibroblasts, and pericytes (268\u2013271) the heterogeneous scar forming cells and associated ECM provides a cellular and biochemical zone within and around the lesion. glial and immune cells, fibroblasts, pericytes and ependymal cells also contribute to the structure of the glial scar (267) fibroblasts contribute to the production of fibronectin, collagen, and laminin in the ECM of the inured spinal cord (267) fibroblasts have also been found in contusive injuries where meninges are intact (268, 270) the astrocytic glial scar has been shown to serve as a protective barrier that prevents spread of infiltrating immune cells into the adjacent segments. blocking this process leads to exacerbated leukocyte infiltration, cell death, myelin damage, and reduced functional recovery. CSPGs (neurocan, versican, brevican, and phosphacan) are robustly upregulated and reach their peak of expression at 2 weeks post-SCI. disruption of BSB and hemorrhage triggers upregulation of CSPGs in the glial scar by exposing the scar forming cells to factors in plasma such as fibrinogen (311). studies in cortical injury have shown that fibrinogen induces CSPG expression in astrocyte study shows degradation of CSPGs using ChABC attenuates axonal dieback in corticospinal fibers in chronic SCI model in the rat. axon regrowth failed to happen following the ablation or prevention of astrocytic scar in acute and chronic SCI. this study points to the importance of reactive and scar forming astrocytes and their pivotal role in the repair process following SCI (322). this is indeed in agreement with previous studies by the same group that showed a beneficial role for activated astrocytes in functional recovery after SCI by limiting the speared of infiltrated inflammatory cells and tissue damage. targeting CSPGs by xyloside or inhibition of their signaling receptors enhances the capacity of NPCs and OPCs for proliferation, oligodendrocyte differentiation and remyelination. RPTP is the main receptor mediating the inhibition of axon growth by CSPGs (327, 328) CSPGs signaling appears to restrict endogenous repair by promoting a pro-inflammatory immune response in SCI (241, 331) inhibition of LAR and RPTP enhanced an anti-inflammatory environment after SCI by promoting the populations of pro-regenerative M2-like microglia/macrophages and regulatory T cells (241) that are known to promote repair process. current evidence has identified a multifaceted inhibitory role for CSPGs in regulating endogenous repair mechanisms after SCI. this suggests targeting CSPGs may present a promising treatment strategy for SCI."}
