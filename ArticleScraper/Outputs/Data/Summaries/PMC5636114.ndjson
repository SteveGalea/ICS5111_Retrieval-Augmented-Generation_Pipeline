{"summary": "histone proteins for packaging of newly synthesized DNA are encoded by the replication-dependent histone genes. they are distinct from the replication-independent histone genes which are expressed constitutively [2] unlike canonical pre-mRNAs, replication-dependent histone pre-mRNAs lack introns and undergo 3\u2019-end processing that differ from cleavage coupled to polyadenylation. the core U7 snRNP consists of two integral and stably associated components: 60-nucleotide U7 snRNA and a unique Sm ring. SLBP bound to the upstream stem-loop stabilizes this interaction, likely by directly or indirectly contacting a subunit((s) of U7 snRNP [17] secondary structure for FLASH is based on the structure of human FLASH NTD. that for Lsm11 is based on Psipred [63] secondary structure prediction of human Lsm11. blue dots indicate residues at the FLASH dimer interface. gaps are indicated by dotted lines. selenomethionyl FLASH NTD forms a coiled-coil dimer. initial phases were obtained using crystals of selenomethionyl FLASH NTD. however, only residues 51\u2013137 were observed in this structure. two views of the FLASH NTD forming a coiled-coil dimer with respective protomers colored in green and yellow orange. the hexahistidine-tag was observed in protomer 1. the length of the coiled-coil FLASH NTD dimer is approximately 100. the protomers do not superimpose perfectly onto each other (r.m.s.d. 1.5) the majority of the FLASH dimer interface residues are leucines and isoleucines, forming the bulk of the hydrophobic interactions. the observed FLASH NTD dimer may be mediated by a disulfide connection. this is unlikely to occur in the reducing environment in the nucleoplasm. the two structures adopt the same coiled-coil dimer (Fig 3A and 3B) residues 53\u201370 from one of the protomers in the structure at 2.6 resolution are stabilized by crystal packing. this protomer appears to form a single long -helix from residues 53\u2013137. the other protomer showed weak electron density for residues 56\u201362. residues 51\u201355 and 63\u201366 are not observed. mutants Y73A/L76A/Y80A and N101A/L104A/N108A have additional C54S/C83A mutations. the first mutated cluster is located closer to the N-terminal end. the second cluster is located near the middle of the NTD. p130 form an ion pair in the dimer interface, generating the R128A/K129A/D130A mutant. as a control, we made the K88A/K92A/K95A mutant, changing three residues located outside of the dimer interface. the migration behavior of this mutant was nearly the same as that for the C54S/C83A protein (Fig 4B). 30.6 (high salt) 3.9 2:1 complex (FLASH NTD dimer with Lsm11 NTD monomer, calculated MW 34.0 kDa) 26.0\u201355.0 (low salt) 34.0 (low salt) 4.3 2:1 complex. the mutations were not able to disrupt the FLASH NTD dimer. the FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex and FLASH NTD alone eluted in single peaks. the weight-averaged molar masses of the samples eluting in the peaks are 31 kDa for the FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex. FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex at 250 mM NaCl (red) and FLASH NTD C54S/C83A at 250 mM NaCl (green) the positions of the peaks for both the FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex and FLASH NTD C54S/C83A mutant were slightly shifted to the left, suggesting a more extended structure for both. ALS showed that the FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex is a heterotrimer consisting of 2 molecules (a dimer) of FLASH and 1 molecule of Lsm11, while FLASH NTD C54S/C83A is a dimer. wild-type FLASH NTD and the FLASH NTD C54S/C83A double mutant have similar sedimentation coefficients of 1.61 and 1.59. traces of absorbance at 280 nm of the protein in 20 mM Tris (pH 7.5) buffer during sedimentation velocity experiment. the protein concentration was 1 mg/ml. for clarity, only every fifth scan is shown. the values were derived from a global fit of the AUC data to a global c(s) distribution model by SEDPHAT [58] b The values were derived from a global fit of the AUC data to a monomer-dimer self-association model by the SEDPHAT program. Lsm11 NTD complex showed a shift in its sedimentation coefficient value from 1.36 to 3.2 with increasing concentration of the complex. this observation indicates that the dissociation and association of the complex is a rapid event [30] and the exact molar mass of the complex cannot be accurately estimated. the broad range of observed molecular weight by AUC is similar to that seen in the SEC-MALS experiment. the initial phases were obtained using crystals of selenomethionyl FLASH NTD. the structure showed that FLASH NTD forms a coiled-coil dimer consisting of two parallel -helices, one from each protomer. however, only residues 51\u2013137 were observed in this structure. the hexahistidine-tag was observed in protomer 1. side chains of residues involved in the dimer interface are shown as sticks. the other side chains are shown as thin sticks. il FLASH NTD dimer is approximately 100, excluding the hexahistidine tag observed for one of the protomers. the majority of the FLASH dimer interface residues are leucines and isoleucines, forming the bulk of the hydrophobic interactions. other hydrophobic interactions are formed by bulky residues such as Tyr73, Tyr80, and Phe94. two structures adopt the same coiled-coil dimer as the wild-type FLASH NTD. the individual protomers of these two mutant dimers also show differences, similar to those observed for the wild-type dimer (S1 Fig). this protomer appears to form a single long helix from residues 53\u2013137. the other protomer showed weak electron density for residues 56\u201362. residues 51\u201355 and 63\u201366 are not observed in the other two structures. mutant in background of C54S/C83A mutations investigated its oligomeric state by analytical gel filtration. results showed that this mutant had a similar migration behavior as the C54S/C83A mutant control, indicating that the deleterious effect of L118A/I119A mutation on binding Lsm11 is not due to the disruption of FLASH NTD dimerization. the Y73A/L76A/Y80A mutant had the same migration behavior as the C54S/C83A control, while the N101A/L104A/N108A and R128A/K129A/D130A mutants actually migrated faster. as a control, we made the K88A/K92A/K95A mutant, changing three residues located outside the dimer interface. the mutations were not able to disrupt the FLASH NTD dimer. for these experiments, we co-expressed his-tagged Lsm11 NTD with un-tagged FLASH NTD in E. coli. the results showed that the Y73A/L76A/Y80A and K88A/K92A/K95A mutants still interacted with Lsm11 NTD. both the FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex and FLASH NTD alone eluted in single peaks. however, the FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex peak had a trailing edge. the weight-averaged molar masses of the samples eluting in the peaks are 31 kDa for the FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex. the positions of the peaks for both the FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex and FLASH NTD C54S/C83A mutant were slightly shifted to the left, suggesting a more extended structure for both. the weight-averaged molar masses of the samples eluting in the peaks are 34.3 kDa for FLASH NTD-Lsm11 NTD complex. wild-type FLASH NTD and the FLASH NTD C54S/C83A double mutant have similar sedimentation coefficients of 1.61 and 1.59 and frictional ratios of 1.81 and 1.86. both proteins have Stokes radius of 3.2\u20133.4 nm, while the long-axis radius is about 6.5 nm. the y-axis on the right is for the protein at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml (B) and 0.8 mg/ml (E) are shown by dashed lines and that at 8 mg/ml (D) are shown by dotted line. 1.79 21.8 3.2 0.08 1.64 2.01 28.5 4.0 FLASH NTD C54S/C83A -
