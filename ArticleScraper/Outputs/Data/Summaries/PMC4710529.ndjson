{"summary": "a number of serologically similar viruses have been identified and grouped to the classification of Senecavirus A. the virus is most closely related to cardioviruses in the family of Picornaviridae. the single-stranded RNA genome of SV-A displays the secondary structural features of an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) that resembles the IRES element of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) of the family Flaviviridae. vesicular disease syndrome, with as yet unidentified etiology, has been termed swine idiopathic vesicular disease (SV-A) despite isolation of SV-A in cell culture, FADDL has been unsuccessful at reproducing clinical signs by experimental inoculation of pigs with live virus. serum antibody neutralizing test and a competitive enzyme linked immunosorbant assay are not widely available. the principal aim of this study was to develop a specific real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) assay for fast, sensitive, and quantitative detection of SV-A RNA in vesicular diagnostic tissues. no animals were used or experimentally infected to generate these field specimens for the purpose of this study. conventional RT-PCR Amplification Total RNA from various specimens were performed using the Magmax Total RNA Isolation kit (Life Technologies) the amplification of a 983 bp fragment from the polyprotein gene in the VP1 region was adopted from the conventional RT-PCR. RT-qPCR was performed using power SYBR Green RNA-to-Ct 1-step kit. RT-qPCR was performed using AgPath-ID one-step RT-PCR reagents. RNA was quantified using a Qubit flourometer (Invitrogen) synthesis of cDNA was performed with random primers and superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) for 50\u00b0C for 30 min, followed by incubation for 5 min at 65\u00b0C. second strand synthesis was performed by addition of Sequenase enzyme (Affymetrix Santa Clara, CA); followed by a ramped incubation to 37\u00b0C for 16 min, followed by 2 min at 94\u00b0C. the final product was amplified using a 10% homogenate (w/v) was made in Minimum Essential Medium Eagle containing 4% fetal bovine serum (Lonza) in a Retsch Mixer Mill 400 using a 25 ml stainless steel grinding jar and a single 20mm stainless steel grinding ball (Retsch) the homogenate was clarified by low speed centrifugation and passed through a sterile 0.45 micron filter (GE Healthcare) DNA sequences of the plasmid inserts were confirmed using an ABI 3900 automated sequencer (Life Technologies) Sequences were assembled using Sequencher program (Gene Codes Corporation) and confirmed to be SV-A using the BLAST function of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Actin RT-qPCR was performed using AgPath-ID one-step RT-PCR reagents (Life Technologies) with cycling parameters: 48\u00b0C for 10 min, 95\u00b0C for 10 min, 45 cycles of: 95\u00b0C for 2 sec, and 60\u00b0C for 40 sec. RNA was quantified using a Qubit flourometer (Invitrogen) sequences from different isolates were aligned to identify a conserved primer set targeting an 87 bp sequence in the VP1 coding region suitable for RT-qPCR amplification. a recombinant plasmid DNA constructed with a 983 bp SV-A sequence was used as the template to test the efficiency of qPCR primers. amplification of a 90 bp product was visualized on 2% agarose gel, and target standard plasmid DNA containing SV-A gene fragment was used as the template for amplification in a green based qPCR reaction. RT-qPCR product had a melting temperature of 78\u00b0C. ilutions showed linearity of RT-qPCR detection over six orders of magnitude. slope value of -3.68 with R2 >0.99 represented 90% efficiency in doubling of RT-qPCR. three independent series of 10-fold dilutions of RNA were subjected to RT-qPCR. representing positive amplification controls for 21 RNA and 8 DNA viruses were subjected to the SV-A RT-qPCR assay (Table 1) none of which yielded amplification or characteristic melting curve signals, suggesting that the primer set selected was highly specific for SV-A sequence detection. all of these diagnostic specimens, listed in Table 2, were previously diagnosed negative for the presence of high-consequence porcine vesicular diseases. s, representing 44 (i.e., 88% of animals tested) clinical animals, showed detectable amplification plots with Ct values ranging between 11 to 38 and Tm values of approximately 78\u00b0C. a slight variation in Tm of products was observed and expected due to known variations in base composition of target amplicon sequences among different isolates. SV-A RNA was found in a variety of different types of clinical specimens including vesicular fluid, epithel lymph node/spleen 29 24 probang 7 6 epithelium 17 12 tonsil 6 4 lung 3 1 blood 1 1 nasal swab 1 1 kidney 1 0 liver 1 0 pooled vesicular sample (vesicular fluid, tissue and/or lesion swab) 19 18 Total # diagnostic specimens 85 67 (79%) Total # clinical animals 50 44 (88%) A control panel comprised of tissues from 35 swine known to be free of 159 specimens have been confirmed SV-A qRT-PCR positive after virus isolation through November 2015. the qRT-PCR was regularly used starting in June 2015. it resulted in the detection of 52 SV-A positive investigations out of 101 investigations submitted during that time period. five viral isolates were confirmed positive by qRT-PCR. the genome was sequenced to the reference sequence SVV-001: NC_011349.1 (NCBI). SV-A not detected in bovine tissues The possible cross amplification of other vesicular etiological agents was examined by using vesicular diagnostic specimens from 33 animals with signs of vesicular disease. a recombinant plasmid DNA constructed with a 983 bp SV-A sequence was used as the template to test the efficiency of qPCR primers. amplification of a 90 bp product was visualized on 2% agarose gel. target sequence was confirmed. linear amplification of circular plasmid DNA was between copy numbers of 4 x 100 and 4 x 106. calculated efficiency of 86% from y-slope (-3.72) with correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.9993. five diagnostic RNA samples with three controls were analyzed by RT-qPCR on the SmartCyclerII. three independent series of 10-fold dilutions of RNA were subjected to RT-qPCR. the mean Ct value with negligible deviations from triplicate assays was plotted against logarithmic inputs of RNA template. the mean Ct value with negligible deviations from triplicate assays was plotted against logarithmic inputs of RNA template. SV-A RT-qPCR assay was used to test for the presence of SV-A RNA in 85 field tissue specimens collected over 10 years. all of these diagnostic specimens, listed in Table 2, were previously diagnosed negative for the presence of high-consequence porcine vesicular diseases including FMDV, VSV, VESV, and SVDV. SV-A RNA was found in a variety of different types of clinical specimens including vesicular fluid, epithelium, lymph node, swabs and epithelium from hoof lesion. a slight variation in Tm of products was observed and expected due to known variations in base composition of target amplicon sequences among different isolates. the products which contained a single melting peak with positive CT values produced Tm values within the range of 77.7 to 80.8 control panel comprised of tissues from 35 swine known to be free of clinical vesicular disease was tested and found negative for the presence of SV-A RNA by RT-qPCR. 121 serum specimens collected from domestic and feral swine with or without clinical complications of vesicular lesions were also tested for SV-A particles. similar weak detection was also evidenced in 5.5% of serum from disease-free animals, of 47 feral and 35 domestic species, clinical 67 79 35 swine tissue non clinical 0 39 swine serum non clinical 7 18 35 swine serum non clinical 3 9 47 feral swine serum non clinical 3 6 37 bovine tissue clinical 0 Fig 6. Summary of the 2015 swine vesicular case investigation results from FADDL, January to October 2015. SV-A primers were used in the assay, and to the reference sequence SVV-001: NC_011349.1 (NCBI) a total of 37 archived bovine tissues were analyzed from 33 animals with signs of vesicular disease. some of them were positively diagnosed for the presence of other viruses such as bluetongue virus (BTV), epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) and bovine popular stomatitis virus the SV-A RT-qPCR test developed in this study complemented our laboratory needs for a fast, specific, sensitive and quantitative assay. we applied it to analyze swine vesicular diagnostic specimens previously found negative of the foreign animal disease agents FMD, VS, SVD and VES. farm animals are routinely monitored for appearance of vesicular lesions. feral swine are less frequently observed for vesicular disease. pathogenicity of the virus remains unknown and a cause for the observed high frequency of SV-A infection is not yet understood."}
