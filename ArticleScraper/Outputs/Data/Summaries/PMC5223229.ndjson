{"summary": "human convalescent plasma derived from patients recovered from diseases has been used in emergency response to emerging viral diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, H5N1 influenza, Ebola virus disease and Middle East respiratory syndrome5. convalescent serum was injected into the cerebroventricular space of embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5) brains. fetal brains were inspected at E18.5 by immunocytochemistry staining. a large number of cells in the cortex were infected in the brains injected with ZIKV2 and the number of infected cells in the fetal brains from serum-treated pregnant mice decreased substantially. the number of cells positive for activated form of caspase-3 also reduced dramatically. n = 6, ZIKV+Serum: n = 7. (D, E) Similar position of coronal sections of vehicle- or Serum-treated ZIKV-infected brains with Nissl staining. right panel: quantification of thickness stained with individual markers. n: slice numbers from 4 Mock+Vehicle and Mock+Serum brains (B-I), 9 ZIKV+Vehicle and ZIKV+Serum brains (B-E) or 6 ZIKV+Vehicle and ZIKV+Serum brains (F-I) compared with mock-infected littermates, a mild reduction in brain sizes was observed in ZIKV-infected the thinning of VZ/SVZ in the infected brains was shown to be caused by dysregulation of NPC cell cycle and proliferation2,4. we inspected whether convalescent serum could rescue the reduction of NPCs caused by ZIKV infection. this reduction was rescued by convalescent serum treatment, in agreement with the rescue of the thinning of VZ/SVZ. a panel of human monoclonal antibodies with potent neutralizing activities have now been characterized10,11. healthy human serum can not protect embryos from ZIKV brain infection and microcephaly."}
