{"summary": "the probability of no escapes in y years for a single lab is (1 P1)y. for y years and n labs, the probability of no escapes is (1 P1)yn. the probability of at least one escape in y years is 1 ( 1 P 1 ) y n 3 Solving equation 3 for y will allow this question to be answered. the number of years of research, y, which must elapse before we reach our risk tolerance is inversely proportional to the number of labs, n."}
