{"summary": "mice were ventilated at low tidal volume VT = 8 mL/kg or high tidal volume VT = 16 mL/kg and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 2 or 6 cmH2O. MV with repetitive RM every 5 min resulted in stable respiratory mechanics. mechanical ventilation (MV) of mice is increasingly used in biomedical research. the mechanisms of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) have been explored intensively. major reasons for this are the focus on the mechanisms of VILI and the lack of comprehensive monitoring of pulmonary and cardiovascular key parameters. 30 min 7/10 2/0 * + /P + [3] 60 min 8 6/3 ** + [4] 140 min 30/10 2/0 2x/min + + /ECG [5] 150 min 8 6/2 1x/5 min or 1x/75 min + /P + [60] 4 h 25/7 + /ECG [12] 4 h 20/6 2 [61] 4 h 30 [62] 4 h 20/7 02 [7] 4 h 8 4 + studies on the mechanisms of VILI have identified several beneficial ventilation strategies, among them low tidal volume (VT) ventilation and application of recruitment manoeuvres (RM) as well as high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) without RM, pulmonary compliance is likely to decrease as shown already many years ago in anesthetized dogs. recurrent RM reduced the extent of pulmonary inflammation, although mild inflammation was present in the lungs of all ventilated animals. mice were anaesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium and fentanyl. mice were tracheotomized with a 20-gauge cannula and connected to the ventilator. a catheter was inserted into the carotid artery. blood pressure and ECG were recorded permanently. the first series of experiments was performed with a PEEP of 2 cmH2O. repeated recruitment manoeuvres of 1 s duration and 30 cmH2O peak pressure were applied every five minutes (RM5) in one lowVT (lowVTRM5) and one highVT group (highVTRM5) or every 60 minutes (RM60) in one lowVT group (lowVTRM5). s and 30 cmH2O pressure, FiO2: fraction of inspired oxygen, low tidal volume, highVT: high tidal volume, RM5: one recruitment manoeuvre every 60 minutes, noRM: no recruitment manoeuvres, RM60: one recruitment manoeuvre every 60 minutes. mice were ventilated for six hours with low VT = 8 mL/kg or high VT = 16 mL/kg, PEEP = 2 cmH2O and p0.05, ** p0.01, *** p0.001 versus all other groups. p0.05, ** p0.01, *** p0.001 versus all other groups. n = 4, highVTnoRM n = 4, lowVTRM60 n = 5) *** p0.001 versus all other groups. blood samples from ventilated mice were analysed for pO2, pCO2, pH, HCO3 and standard base excess (SBE) blood samples from ventilated mice were analysed for pO2, pCO2, pH, HCO3 and standard base excess. cytospin preparation followed by a modified Giemsa stain (Diff-Quick; Medion Diagnostics, D\u00fcdingen, CH) and differential leukocyte count were quantified using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. the ratio of BSA in serum and BAL fluid was calculated to determine microvascular permeability. boxCox transformation was performed to achieve homoscedasticity and normal distribution, when necessary. non-parametric data were analysed with the Kruskall-Wallis test followed by Dunn's post-test. body temperature was measured rectally and kept stable between 36.5\u00b0C and 37.5\u00b0C by a homeothermic blanket. mice were either ventilated with low tidal volume (lowVT) of 8 mL/kg and a frequency of 180 min1 or high tidal volume (highVT) of 16 mL/kg and a frequency of 90 min1. mice were ventilated for six hours with low VT = 8 mL/kg or high VT = 16 mL/kg. RM were performed every five minutes (PEEP6_RM5), every 60 minutes (PEEP6_RM60) n = 6, highVTRM5 n = 6, lowVTnoRM n = 5, highVTnoRM: n = 5, highVTnoRM: n = 5, lowVTRM60: n = 5). p-values for group comparisons are shown in supplementary Table S1. VTRM5 n = 5, lowVTnoRM n = 4, highVTnoRM n = 4, lowVTRM60 n = 5. p0.05, ** p0.01, *** p0.001, *** p0.001 versus all other groups. sets in A and D contain enlarged images of exemplary leukocytes. scores from 0 to 4 were given according to the number of fulfilled criteria. blood samples from ventilated mice were analysed for pO2, pCO2, pH, HCO3 and standard base excess (SBE) blood gas analysis from anaesthetized control mice was not representative due to reduced breathing activity. histopathology was evaluated in a blinded manner. each criterion scored one point, if present, thus scores ranged from 0 to 4. nine to ten sections per lung were evaluated. pulmonary compliance (R) nearly tripled in mice ventilated with 16 mL/kg and no RM (highVTnoRM) resistance and compliance showed less dramatic trends in mice ventilated with 16 mL/kg and no RM (highVTnoRM) the stability of the lung mechanics demonstrates that application of deep inflations of 1 s duration and 30 cmH2O are sufficient to prevent the deterioration of lung functions in healthy mouse lungs ventilated with 2 cmH2O PEEP. in this group, respiratory conditions were instable. R and C worsened comparable to the lowVTnoRM group, but improved significantly after each RM. blood gas analyses revealed that infusion of saline and application of 3% CO2 in the high VT groups were adequate to keep acid-base status stable. the pO2/FiO2 ratio was between 530 and 620 mmHg in both RM5 and highVTnoRM group. most mice ventilated with highVTnoRM had physiological pCO2 levels after six hours. mmol/L 6.01.6 19.21.6 23.62.3 19.73.4 21.81.9 SBE [mmol/L] 5.51.7 3.52.1 5.42.3 3.51.6 Blood gas analyses from arterial blood after six hours of mechanical ventilation with PEEP = 2 cmH2O. protein levels were highest in the groups without RM. neutrophils were highest in mice ventilated with high VT. less neutrophils were recruited to alveoli of lowVT mice. no severe lung injury was induced by ventilation strategies applied. a plateau was reached at about 30% of the initial C. also ventilation with RM60 (PEEP6_RM60) did not suffice to keep lung functions entirely stable at a PEEP of 6 cmH2O. R, in contrast, returned to the initial value after each RM. IL-6 and KC levels in the BAL fluid were highest in the PEEP6_noRM group, followed by the PEEP6_RM5 group. both mediators were lowest in the group ventilated without RM. a higher PEEP helps preventing the release of pro-inflammatory mediators induced by formation of atelectasis. noRM group (R: p0.01; C: p0.001) showed major alterations in the periphery of the lung. Tissue damping (G) and tissue elastance (H) were elevated in both highVTnoRM and lowVTnoRM mice, reaching significantly higher values in the latter group. heart frequency, blood pressure and oxygenation Anaesthesia resulted in reduced heart frequency (300\u2013400 min1) and mean blood pressure (50\u201360 mmHg) the fluid support with 200L NaCl per hour in all groups was adequate to keep blood pressure stable. oxygen saturation, measured by pulsoxymetry, was over 90% in all mice at all times. lowVTRM60 showed very heterogeneous pO2/FiO2 ratios between 260 and 570 mmHg and markedly increased pCO2 levels. bicarbonate (HCO3 ) was only slightly reduced, resulting in negative values for standard base excess. pro-inflammatory cytokine levels Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and Keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC) were elevated in the BAL fluid and blood serum from all ventilated mice. in both RM5 groups serum levels of IL-6 and KC were clearly lower than in all other ventilation groups. highVTnoRM mice showed alveolar congestion, bringing the lung injury score up to three. only some highVTnoRM mice showed alveolar congestion, bringing the injury score up to three. ventilation without RM leads to impaired lung functions, which stabilize within two hours, though at a low level. we therefore examined the effect of repetitive RM (30 cmH2O) every 5 min. in both the low- and highVT group, lung mechanics stayed in a physiological range and remained unchanged during the whole experiment. blood gas analyses revealed that infusion of saline and application of 3% CO2 in the high VT groups were adequate to keep the acid-base status stable. most mice ventilated with highVTnoRM had physiological pCO2 levels after six hours. the pO2/FiO2 ratio was decreased significantly to around 200 mmHg in the lowVTnoRM group. pCO2 [mmHg] 38.43.9 34.94.0 58.37.61 40.615.1 50.19.4 pH 7.330.03 7.360.04 7.220.03 7.320.08 7.280.05 HCO3- [mmol/L] 19.51.6 19.21.6 23.62.3 19.73.4 21.81.9 SBE [mmol/L] 6.01.6 5.51.7 3.52.1 5.42.3 3.51.6 Blood gas analyses from arterial blood after six hours of mechanical ventilation with induced protein (IP-10) and Tumour necrosis factor- (TNF-) were not significantly increased in the BAL from ventilated mice compared to unventilated controls. the only cell types found in BAL fluid of unventilated control mice were monocytes and macrophages. RM5 at a PEEP of 6 cmH2O (PEEP6_RM5) showed stable lung functions. ventilation without RM (PEEP6_noRM) resulted in a strong decrease in C. also ventilation with RM60 (PEEP6_RM60) did not suffice to keep lung functions entirely stable. pCO2 levels were significantly elevated in the groups PEEP6_RM60 and PEEP6_noRM, compared to the control group. IL-6 and KC levels in the BAL fluid were highest in the PEEP6_noRM group, followed by the PEEP6_RM5 group. both mediators were lowest in the PEEP6_noRM group. KC levels were highest in the group ventilated without RM. ventilation with RM60 (PEEP6_RM60) did not suffice to keep lung functions entirely stable at a PEEP of 6 cmH2O. the decrease in C between the RMs was relatively moderate, but the initial C was not maintained over six hours. R, in contrast, returned to the initial value after each RM. IL-6 and KC levels in the BAL fluid were highest in the PEEP6_noRM group, followed by the PEEP6_RM5 group. both mediators were lowest in the group ventilated without RM. a higher PEEP helps preventing the release of pro-inflammatory mediators induced by formation of atelectasis. low VT ventilation improves the outcome of patients with injured lungs [32] and also reduces inflammation in those with healthy lungs [33] it seems highly important to gain more information on the effects of repetitive \u2018sigh-like\u2019 recruitment manoeuvres during low VT ventilation. we initially selected a relatively low PEEP level, because we plan to use the same PEEP in future studies on the molecular mechanisms of VILI. the supplementation of 3% CO2 to the inhaled gas mixture was adequate to prevent hypocapnia, which otherwise would have occurred at a respiratory rate of 90 min1 in the highVTRM5 group. therefore, a protective effect of hypercapnia during MV seems unlikely. a pressure of 30 cmH2O for each RM was necessary to maintain lung volume stable. small decrease in hysteresivity shows that H increased slightly stronger than G. further, it underlines that impaired lung functions were not primarily due to heterogeneity caused by narrowing of small airways. atelectasis was more severe in low VT than in high VT ventilation. blood gas analysis revealed impaired gas exchange in lowVTnoRM and lowVTRM60 mice. a lack of recruitment manoeuvres may cause what has been termed atelectotrauma. the study demonstrates that repetitive recruitment manoeuvres may cause what has been termed atelectotrauma. IL-6 and KC were increased in the BAL and blood serum of all ventilated mice. it appears that ventilation will always cause mild inflammation in the lungs. it is well-established that protective ventilation attenuates cytokine liberation in the lung and circulation. concentrations were calculated by multiplication with the dilution factor. cytokine levels were in the same range in all groups, allowing a comparison. IP-10 is proposed to play a role in development of ARDS. PEEP = 2 cmH2O was abolished in all groups ventilated with a PEEP = 6 cmH2O. it is well known that a higher PEEP helps to prevent narrowing of large airways during MV. an experimental ventilation strategy using low VT, PEEP and RM resulted in a better outcome in ARDS patient. ventilation with low VT, recurrent RM and sizable PEEP is the most protective ventilation strategy for healthy mice. s is closer to the variable breathing pattern of spontaneously breathing subjects than monotonic MV without variation in VT or breathing frequency. a PEEP level of 6 cmH2O has protective effects and is therefore advisable in studies that require MV. a low PEEP of 2 cmH2O combined with recurrent RM is less protective, but still suffices to gain stable respiratory conditions. ventilation with low VT, recurrent RM and sizable PEEP is the most protective ventilation strategy for healthy mice."}
