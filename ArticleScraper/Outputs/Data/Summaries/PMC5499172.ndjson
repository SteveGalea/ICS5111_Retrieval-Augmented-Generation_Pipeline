{"summary": "CC line refers to the generations between G2:F1 and the point they became > 90% homozygous or extinct. a CC line denotes a CC line that has reached 90% homozygosity. the CC breeding schema used a design so that each of the eight founder strains had an equal probability to be represented in the autosomes. a funnel was declared extinct when no combinations of males and females within that strain would produce fertile offspring necessary to maintain a colony. a single male from each of 347 independent lines was transferred to the laboratory of Fernando Pardo-Manuel de Villena at the UNC at Chapel Hill. phenotyping was performed on subsets of the 347 males from extinct CC lines. each male was killed using CO2 asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation and the carcass was weighed. sperm were diluted, if necessary, and counted using a hemocytometer. the cauda was clipped with iris scissors and transferred to a 37\u00b0 incubator. sperm were then extruded from the cauda with fine forceps. sperm were classified as progressive, intermediate, hyperactivated, slow, or weakly motile. the HTF sperm suspension used for motility analysis was also used to assess sperm morphology. multiple images of each section were recorded using an Olympus BX51 microscope equipped with a motorized stage and an Olympus DP72 digital camera. a composite image of each transverse section (20 ) was generated using a custom interactive image analysis package (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) MDA markers were selected to provide genetic information over a uniform grid based on SNP discovery performed in 17 inbred strains. markers were called using the MouseDivGeno package (Didion et al. 2012) the marker set was then refined through a set of filters. transition probabilities were modeled by an (1e(/K)) exponential decay. a correction factor was added for shared recombination between homozygous inbred states. forty extinct males were genotyped using the Mouse Universal Genotyping Array. QTL mapping was performed with the R package DOQTL, v1.6.0. QTL significance intervals were defined by the 95% Bayesian credible interval. log of the odds ratio was the reported mapping statistic. samples can be found at http://database.csbio.unc.edu/Infertility. MDA genotyping data can be found at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.400269. The genotypes of extant strains are available to the public linked through the NIH-funded Mutant Mouse Resource and Research Center. a funnel was declared extinct when no combinations of males and females within that strain would produce fertile offspring necessary to maintain a colony. a single male from each of 347 independent lines was transferred to the laboratory of Fernando Pardo-Manuel de Villena. mice from six other CC strains do not have any PWK/PhJ contribution on chromosome 2. mice were outcrossed to each other to generate 12 and 11 of the possible 15 F1 hybrids in cases and controls. mice were housed in standard 20 30-cm ventilated polysulfone cages. phenotyping was performed on subsets of the 347 males from extinct CC lines. each male was killed using CO2 asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation. each testis, each epididymis with attached vas deferens, and seminal vesicles were recorded. sperm tracks (90 frames, 1.5 sec) and kinetic parameters for individual sperm were captured at 60 Hz using motility analysis parameters (mouse 2). tracks in 10 fields were typically recorded for each mouse, along with the percentage of motile sperm and the average path velocity (VAP, m/sec) testis histology After wet weights were determined, the left testis was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and preserved for future use while the right testis was prepared for future use. distinct differences occurred in 1 out of every 50 samples. analysis We used one-way fixed effect ANOVA and Student\u2019s t-tests to evaluate differences in reproductive phenotypes within the extinct lines and in the validation populations. all statistical analyses were conducted with JMP 12 or R 3.2.3 software. a hidden Markov model (HMM) was used to infer the founder haplotype mosaics from the filtered MDA genotypes. a transition model was derived to estimate the probability of transitions between the founder genotypes of adjacent markers by recombination. we incorporated a penalty against the fourth, seventh, and eighth positions of each line\u2019s funnel code into the HMM\u2019s transition probabilities. this accounts for a constraint imposed by the funnel breeding structure used to develop the CC. however, a small nonzero probability (1 104) of such transitions was included to allow for potential breeding errors. the subspecific origin of the haplotypes that drive the QTL has been reported previously (Yang et al. 2011). males from 347 funnels that became extinct from 2008 to 2011 were included in this study. CC extinct lines have balanced founder contributions in the autosomes. chromosome X Inspection of the haplotypes identified six extinct lines in which one or more of the eight founder strains were absent. we measured founder haplotype frequency in chromosome X independently from the autosomes. allele frequencies of extinct CC lines in chromosome X are more variable than in the autosomes. this is because of the constraints imposed by funnel code. extinction is not associated with strong selection in favor of or against heterozygosity at one or a few loci. males are infertile in nearly half of the extinct CC lines. males are infertile in nearly half of the extinct CC lines. CC extinct fertile and infertile males have statistically similar means and distributions for the majority of the reproductive traits measured. both the CC extinct infertile and fertile males have a wider phenotypic range than the founders. CC extinct lines show large variation in reproductive organ weights. phenotypic range for males from the extinct lines was apparent in distribution of testis weight, epididymis + vas deferens weight, and seminal vesicle weight. extinct fertile males (16.7 106 sperm/mouse) and C57BL/6J, NOD/ShiLtJ, and NZO/HlLtJ males (F Ratio = 5.4218, P-value 0.0001) sperm counts have a positively skewed distribution with a long tail in the CC extinct mice. age was not significantly correlated with motile sperm in CC extinct mice. we measured other kinematic parameters of sperm motility, including VAP (m/sec), VSL (m/sec), VCL (m/sec), ALH (m), and BCF (Hz) the means for both CC extinct fertile and infertile are significantly lower than two founder strains, PWK/PhJ and WSB/EiJ. age of the mouse was not significantly correlated with any of the morphology traits. testis histology in the CC extinct lines was highly variable, ranging from normal spermatogenesis to partial or complete loss of germ cells. additional abnormal features observed include vacuoles in the seminiferous epithelium, germ cell sloughing into the tubule lumen, abnormal germ cells, expanded rete testis, abnormal blood vessels, tumors or cysts.

CC extinct lines show large variation in reproductive organ weights. sixty-seven mice (19.3%) in the CC extinct population had small testes, with a mean size 0.04 g. weight was highly positively correlated with testis, epididymis + vas deferens weight, and seminal vesicle weight. many CC extinct lines have low sperm counts Mean sperm counts in CC extinct infertile males were significantly lower than counts for CC extinct fertile males. the distribution of the percentage of motile sperm is wider in the extinct CC lines than in the eight founder strains. the exception is in CAST/EiJ mice, where the mean percentage of motile sperm was 30%. the distribution of sperm assessed ranged from 1 to 395 sperm per mouse. we included a cutoff that required a minimum of 40 sperm classified for morphological features. this removed 36 samples, leaving 169 for the analysis. both CC extinct fertile and infertile males have approximately the same mean and distribution for tubule count and seminiferous epithelium length. the variance is greater compared to the founder strains. testis histology in the CC extinct lines was highly variable. from 151 to 347 phenotypes, we identified significant QTL (P-value 0.05) for seven traits, including genetic infertility, reproductive organ weights, and measures of sperm quality. QTL identified for fertility traits in males of CC extinct lines. chromosome X is a binary trait with fertile males producing offspring with a related or unrelated outbred female. males in 53% of lines were genetically fertile and males in 47% of lines were infertile. CC founder allelic effects of genetic fertility in chromosome 2. we identified QTL for combined testis weight, combined epididymis + vas deferens weight, and weight of seminal vesicles. for both traits, the NZO/HlLtJ haplotype is associated with an increase in organ weights. validation of the first QTL on chromosome 2 is described in the next section. we identified a QTL for ALH on chromosome 6 (Figure S6). the allele effects at this QTL are mostly complex. the number of mice for each population and generation is provided in Table S1 and phenotypes are provided in Table S9. the validation of Vcl1 on chromosome 2 refers to cohorts that contained the PWK/PhJ allele or an alternative allele. t 0.0001) reproducing the PWK/PhJ haplotype effect in the CC founders and CC extinct populations. failure to reach significance may be due to smaller sample size. QTL allelic effects for most reproductive traits were driven by PWK/PhJ or CAST/EiJ haplotypes. these two strains are derived from M. musculus musculus and M. musculus castaneus. other six founder strains have mostly a M. musculus domesticus origin. extinction is not associated with grossly distorted haplotype frequencies. but there is a striking difference between the global haplotype frequency of the CC extinct lines and CC living strains. both extinct CC lines and living CC strains have a deficit in the contribution of CAST/EiJ and PWK/PhJ haplotypes. the only consistent transmission ration distortion (TRD) observed was the overrepresentation of WSB/EiJ on chromosome 2, now known to be due to responder to meiotic drive 2 (R2d2). homozygosity for the WSB haplotype for females precludes meiotic drive and is not associated with reduced litter size. genetic diversity between the eight founder strains of the CC has created an abundance of allelic combinations that have not occurred in any existing inbred mouse strains. these new allelic arrangements produce CC strains that are more reproductively fit than the founder strains, as well as strains that are reproductively unfit and contain abnormal phenotypes. individuals in the CC extinct population that had a PWK/PhJ haplotype were much more likely to be infertile. the X chromosome is particularly enriched in loci previously identified in hybrid incompatibility, sterility, and speciation. previous research on the weight of seminal vesicles using 13 inbred strains identified a novel overlapping QTL on chromosome 4. a significant QTL on chromosome 14 for the percentage of hyperactivated sperm just after isolation from the epididymis. this region of chromosome 14 is enriched with genes associated with sperm development. premature hyperactivation has been reported as a motility defect. validation testing for Vcl1 is independent from replication, as it can offer new biological understanding of the trait. the allele effects under the QTL are clearly driven by the PWK/PhJ haplotype. the inclusion of three subspecies was motivated by the desire to increase genetic diversity in the CC. the five classical founder strains in the CC, as well as the majority of the classical mouse strains commonly used in research, are derived from the same few fancy mice.
