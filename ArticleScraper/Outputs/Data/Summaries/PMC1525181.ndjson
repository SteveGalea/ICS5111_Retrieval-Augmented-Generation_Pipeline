{"summary": "studies have shown that gamma interferon (IFN-) synergizes with IFN-/ to inhibit HSV-2 replication in vitro. the presence of CDM did not alter the antiviral activity of IFN-, IFN- or the synergism exerted by their combination. the administration of CDM in vivo could not affect the biological activity of IFNs, which are so important mediators of the innate resistance to HSV-2 infection. meliacine inhibited the replication of HSV-1 and HSV-2 in vero cells [5] and exhibits synergistic antiviral activity when combined with acyclovir. meliacine is a weak inducer of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) in murine macrophage cultures. it causes a synergistic effect on the production of TNF- induced by LPS. meliacine is a weak inducer of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) in murine macrophage cultures. the compound 1-cinnamoyl-3,11-dihydroxymeliacarpin (CDM) is the molecule responsible for the broad spectrum of meliacine antiviral action [22]. in summary, here we analyzed: i) the susceptibility of HSV-2 to IFN-, IFN- and IFNs combination on HSV-2 plaque formation. the level of inhibition achieved with IFN- and IFN- combination treatment was not a consequence of doubling the amount of IFN per culture. the effect of IFN- and IFN- combination treatment was not a consequence of doubling the amount of IFN per culture. IFN- (100) 19 3.1 5.3 IFN- (200) 51.5 5.1 1.9 IFN- (200) 53 5.1 1.9 aVero cells were treated continuously with IFN-, IFN- or combinations of these cytokines from 16 h before infection until the end of the experiment. each interferon showed a greater antiviral activity than in plaque reduction assay. in cultures treated with 100 IU/ml of IFN- or IFN-, MS and G replication was 8-fold and 100-fold reduced respectively at 24 h p.i. supernatants were harvested on the indicated days p.i. and viral titers were determined by plaque assay. average fold inhibition in viral replication observed in cells treated 100 IU/ml each of () IFN-, () IFN- or () IFN- and IFN- was calculated as (average viral titers in vehicle-treated/average viral titers in IFN-treated) 87.5% of vehicle-treated cells were destroyed by 48 h p.i. treatment with IFN- or IFN- delayed the onset of CPE in MS-infected cultures. however, at 48 h p.i. the cultures appeared like vehicle treated cells. one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc t test confirmed that the differences were significant (p 0.001) the results of these experiments supported the previous findings that combination of IFN- and IFN- inhibited HSV-2 replication in the presence of CDM. the results obtained following protocol i) are depicted in Figure 3a. the antiviral effect due to interferon alone or in combination is 2-fold increased in cells pretreated with CDM. the antiviral effect of CDM per se reduced HSV-2 replication by 20-fold. vero cells treated with 100 IU/ml of IFN-, 100 IU/ml of IFN- or a combination of both for 16 h before infection with HSV-2 MS. after virus adsorption cells were re-fed with fresh cytokines which remained until 24 h p.i. the concentration of IFN- and IFN- used in the present experiment was those previously tested against HSV-1 (KOS and F strains) the effectiveness of HSV-1 strains KOS and F plaque formation was quite modestly reduced by the presence of IFN- or IFN- alone. IFN- (100) 86 6.6 1.6 IFN- (100)+IFN- (100) 36.5 4.3 3.8 IFN- (200) 68 5.8 2 IFN- (200) 72 6 1.9 HSV-2 G Vehicle 98.5 7 - IFN- (100) 81 6.4 1.2 IFN- (100) 98 7 1 IFN- (100) + IFN- (100) 11.5 2.4 8.6 IFN- (200) 52 5.1 reduction in each group was calculated as follows: number of plaques in vehicle/number of plaques in treatments. values represent mean from three independent experiments. viral titers recovered at 48 and 72 h from cultures treated with IFN- or IFN- were reduced by 2-fold in MS-infected cultures and 2-and 3-fold in G infected cultures respectively. titers of HSV-2 MS were reduced 100-fold approximately relative to vehicle treated Vero cells at all time point tested. IFN- or () IFN- was calculated as (average viral titers in vehicle-treated/average viral titers in IFN-treated) one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc t test confirmed that the differences were significant (p 0.001) treatment with IFN combination protects HSV-2 infected cells from viral cytopathic effect. treatment with IFN protects HSV-2 infected cells from viral cytopathic effect. one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc t test confirmed the differences were significant. the number of surviving cells was determined at 12, 24, 36 and 48 h p.i. a comparison of Figure 2b and 2c shows that in the presence of CDM alone cells were highly protected from HSV-2 cytopathicity. when cells were treated with CDM plus IFN combination there seems to be an additive antiviral effect. CDM was present during 16 h IFN antiviral induction period. antiviral effect of CDM per se reduced HSV-2 replication by 20-fold. masked interaction with IFNs. CDM was added simultaneously with IFN and remained until virus harvest. CDM was added with IFN 16 h before infection, re-added after infection and remained to virus harvest. Several concentrations of CDM were added after HSV-2 MS infection. recent studies showed that co-activation of IFN/ and IFN- receptors renders cells highly resistant to HSV-1 replication [20]. this finding is turning to be a general phenomenon since a synergistic antiviral effect of the combination of IFN- and IFN- was also demonstrated for other members of Herpesviridae [20,23,33] and a variety of RNA viruses like SARS [34], Lassa virus [35] and HCV [25] a concentration of 50 g/ml of CDM alone or in combination with interferon did not affect uninfected cell viability. the presence of CDM for 48 h contributes to protect cells from virus CPE. the results were not perturbed by compounds cytopathicity. sensitivity of HSV-2 to CDM increased steadily in accordance with time of cell treatment. after 2 h pretreatment with CDM virus titer was 2 fold reduced. if pretreatment was extended to 16 h, virus reduction increased 10 times. IFN-, together with IFN- synergistically inhibits replication of HSV-2 in vitro. we hypothesize that in vivo administration of CDM could not affect the antiviral activity of interferons to inhibit HSV-2 replication in the mice genital tract. vero cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 105 cells per well. 12 h later cultures were treated with vehicle, 100 IU/ml of IFN- and/or 100 IU/ml of each. vero cells were established at a density of 2 104 cells/well in 96-well plates. 12 h later fresh culture medium or medium containing 50 g/ml of CDM or 100 IU/ml of each were added to the culture medium. after virus adsorption the medium was replaced with fresh culture medium. data from IFN-treated groups were compared to vehicle-treated groups. significant differences were determined by one-way analysis of variance. cells and viruses were grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium. vero cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 105 cells per well. 12 h later cultures were treated with vehicle, 100 IU/ml of IFN- or both IFN- and IFN- (100 IU/ml of each) vero cells were inoculated with HSV-2 MS and HSV-1 KOS 16 h later. after virus adsorption the medium was replaced with fresh culture medium containing the same IFN concentrations used in the pretreatment. authors' contributions EP participated in the experimental design, performed all experiments and drafted the manuscript. both authors read and approved the final manuscript."}
