{"summary": "the frequency of Foxp3+ T reg cells was 20\u201330% at 3 and 5 d after infection. it decreased to 10% of total CD4 T cells in the brain and spinal cord by 7 d after infection. the decrease in frequency by day 7 did not reflect a lower rate of proliferation. data are from four to seven mice per time point in two to five independent experiments. rJ2.2-specific T reg cells express IFN- and IL-10. rJ2.2-specific T reg cells express IFN- and IL-10. peptides together (M133 + S358) because virus-specific T reg cells were present in low numbers in the infected CNS. the fraction of T reg cells expressing IFN- increased two- to fourfold. the mean fluorescence intensity of IFN- expression was lower in M133 + S358\u2013specific T reg cells compared with effector CD4 T cells. rJ2.2-infected mice were sacrificed at indicated times after infection. CNS-derived lymphocytes analyzed for IFN- production after peptide stimulation. rJ2.2-infected mice were treated with BFA or vehicle at 6 d after infection. IL-10 production by T reg cells has been previously documented. 50% of IFN-+ T reg cells also expressed IL-10. a substantial percentage only produced IL-10. 6\u201310 pooled brain samples analyzed in three to five independent experiments are shown. error bars indicate mean SEM. These assays all used Foxp3gfp mice to detect virus epitope-specific T reg cells. compared them to T reg cells isolated from naive spleens in proliferation. responder cells were harvested from uninfected spleens and stimulated with anti-CD3 mAb. brain-derived T reg cells expressed higher levels of CD69, ICOS, and CTLA-4 directly ex vivo and of IL-10. cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 mAb. the percentage of suppression by T reg cells is shown. the frequency of M133-specific CD4 T cells is shown. most of the cells were M133-specific T reg cells. a small fraction of these cells were Foxp3+ and most expressed IFN- after M133 peptide stimulation. number of tetramer M133-specific CD4 T cells/3 mice is indicated. some M133 + S358\u2013specific IFN-+ T reg cells in the infected brain expressed high level of helios, consistent with an origin in natural T reg cells. many of the IFN-+ cells were helios intermediate, making it uncertain whether all of these cells were thymically derived. rJ2.2-specific T reg cells were detected in the rJ2.2-infected CNS and not draining CLNs or spleen. the continued expression of IFN- by virus-specific T reg cells likely occurs because virus antigen persists in the infected CNS. rJ2.2-specific T reg cells are most activated and suppressive during acute infection when viral antigen is maximal. rJ2.2-specific T reg cells are detected at 6\u20137 d after infection at the same time as effector CD4 T cells. ns of naive Foxp3gfp and Rg M133 TCR mice are present in the naive T reg cell pool. some M133 + S358\u2013specific T reg cells expressed high levels of helios, a transcription factor expressed by thymus-derived but not induced T reg cells. cytokine expression may suppress proliferation of cognate epitope-specific CD4 T cells. similar fractions of T reg cells and non\u2013T reg CD4 T cells incorporated BrdU at 6 d after infection. it likely reflects recruitment of virus-nonspecific T reg cells into the CNS at early stages of the infection. M133-specific T reg cells were present in the infected CNS until at least 49 d after infection. no positive cells were detected in mice infected with an rJ2.2 variant in which the epitope was mutated, abrogating recognition. the mean fluorescence intensity of IFN- expression was lower in M133 + S358\u2013specific T reg cells compared with effector CD4 T cells. the frequency of Foxp3 and Foxp3+ cells expressing IFN- increased twofold and fivefold after in vivo BFA treatment. rJ2.2-infected Foxp3gfp mice were sacrificed at the indicated times after infection. T reg cells express IFN- after stimulation with peptides M133 + S358 or anti-CD3 mAb. numbers in parentheses represent percentage of IFN-+ T reg cells. T reg cells at sites of Th1-type inflammation express the transcription factor T-bet. all IFN-+ M133 + S358\u2013specific T reg cells were T-bet positive. expression of TNF and IL-10, but not IL-2, by rJ2.2-specific T reg cells. a similar percentage of M133+ S358\u2013specific T reg cells expressed IFN- as was detected in infected Foxp3gfp mice. as a control, we isolated GFP+ and GFP CD4 T cells from the brains of rJ2.2-infected Foxp3gfp mice at day 7 after infection. Foxp3gfp mice infected with rJ2.2 or rJ2.2.MY135Q. CD4 T cells isolated from infected brains at 7 d after infection. 0.2\u20135% of splenic CD4 T cells were M133 specific in uninfected M133 TCR Rg mice. of these cells, 0.5\u20131% were Foxp3+ and most expressed IFN- after M133 peptide stimulation. naive OT-II mice analyzed for tetramer M133\u2013positive T reg cells. numbers of tetramer M133\u2013specific CD4 T cells/3 mice are indicated. representative data from one of three independent experiments are shown. mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) showed that virus-specific T reg cells expressed IFN- and IL-10 in the inflamed brain. we examined cytokine production by MOG35-55-specific T reg cells in Foxp3gfp mice with EAE. IL-10 expression may be particularly useful for detecting epitope-specific T reg cells. production by T reg cells was previously demonstrated in a lethal toxoplasmosis infection. but our results indicate that IFN- is also expressed in the context of a nonlethal viral infection. suppression was estimated to be 20\u201350-fold more potent if T reg cells were specific for an epitope at a site of inflammation. suppression was estimated to be 20\u201350-fold more potent if T reg cells were specific for an epitope at a site of inflammation. rJ2.2-specific T reg cells originate, at least, from natural T reg cells. epitope-specific CD4 T cells may be detected by cytokine expression. previous efforts using T reg cells therapeutically have used adoptive transfer of in vitro propagated T reg cells. RNA was isolated using an RNeasy Mini kit (Invitrogen) PCR products were synthesized because V8 is the most commonly used V element in the M133-specific response. PCR products were cloned into plasmid vector pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen) TCR mice expressing both M133-specific TCR- and TCR- were produced. epitope M133 specificity was confirmed by analysis of GFP+ cells in the infected CNS using peptide stimulation. eFluor 450-conjugated anti-CD11b (M1/70), CD11c (N418), F4/80 (BM8), B220 (RA3-6B2), and CD49b (DX5) mAbs (eBioscience); and IL-10-APC (JES5-16E3) and Helios-PE (22F6; BioLegend). mice were injected with 2 mg BrdU (BD) at 6 d after infection. intracellular expression of IFN-, IL-10, TNF, IL-2, or IL-17 was assayed. rJ2.2- or rJ2.2.MY135Q-infected brains or naive spleens of Foxp3gfp mice using a CD4+ T cell isolation kit and AutoMACS or a mouse CD4+ T cell enrichment kit. after enrichment of CD4+ T cells, CD4+GFP responder and CD4+GFP+ regulatory T cells were then sorted using a FACSDiva or FACSAria cell single cell suspensions were prepared from spleens and cervical, axillary, brachial inguinal, and mesenteric LNs of uninfected 10-wk Foxp3gfp and OT-II mice. CD4 T cells were isolated by negative selection using a CD4 T cell isolation kit II. cells were then stained with anti-PE magnetic microbeads and separated on an MS column. two-tailed unpaired Student\u2019s t tests were used to analyze differences in mean values between groups. differences with values of P 0.05 were considered significant. online supplemental material available at http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20110236/DC1. OT-II mice were transgenic for expression of a TCR specific for epitope OVA323-339. splenocytes were harvested 7 d after infection from mice infected i.p. with the neurovirulent hepatitis virus. epitope-specific CD4 T cells were captured using a mouse IFN- secretion assay. the majority of CD4 T cells in the infected CNS were GFP+. I-Ab/M133 tetramer+ GFP+ cells were sorted from the infected CNS. two TCR- chains (V2.3 and TRAV14-1) were detected using RT-PCR. anti-CD3-PerCP-Cy5.5 (RM 4\u20135), CD69-PE (H1.2F3), IL-2-PE (JES6-5H4; BD); purified functional anti-CD3, CD3-PerCP-Cy5.5 (145-2C11), CD4\u2013Alexa Fluor 700 (RM 4\u20135), CD16/CD32-biotin or -PerCP-Cy5.5 (93), Foxp3-FITC, -PE, or cells were stained with 8 g/ml PE-conjugated I-Ab/M133 tetramers. cells were then incubated with anti\u2013CD16/CD32-biotin and anti\u2013CD4-PerCP-Cy5.5. results are shown after gating on CD16/CD32-negative cell populations. infected mice were treated with 0.25 mg BFA (Sigma-Aldrich) or vehicle (5% DMSO) intravenously. only infected mice were analyzed because virtually no T cells are detected in the uninfected brain. cells were harvested and stained with anti\u2013CD4-PE and anti\u2013Foxp3\u2013Alexa Fluor 647. CD4+Foxp3 responder cells were analyzed for CFSE dilution. percentage of suppression by T reg cells was calculated as follows. mice were immunized with 0.4 ml of an emulsion containing 300 g MOG35-55 (>95% purity; AnaSpec) in PBS. 200 ng pertussis toxin was administered in 0.2 ml PBS i.v. on the day of immunization and 48 h later. Fig. S5 shows helios expression by IFN-\u2013expressing virus-specific T reg cells in the brains of infected mice. IL-10 and IL-17 expression by MOG35-55-specific T reg cells in the CNS of mice with EAE. PCR products were synthesized because V8 is the most commonly used V element in the M133-specific response. an M133-specific TCR- (V8.3, TRBV13-1) identified in three of three mice was produced. retroviral producer cell lines expressing this TCR- were produced and used to transduce B6 donor bone marrow. a recombinant rJ2.2 in which the M133 epitope was mutated to abolish binding to the I-Ab antigen (rJ2.2.MY135Q) was constructed as described previously. 6\u20137-wk-old WT B6 and Foxp3gfp mice were inoculated intracerebrally. mononuclear cells were stained with 8 g/ml PE-conjugated I-Ab/M133 tetramers. cells were then incubated with anti\u2013CD16/CD32-biotin and anti\u2013CD4-PerCP-Cy5.5. results are shown after gating on CD16/CD32-negative cells. mononuclear cells isolated from the brain and spinal cord were stimulated with 5 M of peptides. rJ2.2-specific epitopes encompass residues 133\u2013147 of the transmembrane (M) protein and residues 358\u2013372 of the surface (S) glycoprotein. pleens of Foxp3gfp mice using a CD4+ T cell isolation kit and AutoMACS. CD4+GFP responder and CD4+GFP+ regulatory T cells were then sorted using a FACSDiva or FACSAria cell sorter. cells were harvested and stained with anti\u2013CD4-PE and anti\u2013Foxp3\u2013Alexa Fluor 647. CD4 T cells were isolated by negative selection using a CD4 T cell isolation kit II. cells were then stained with anti-CD16/32 mAb (2.4G2) and PE-conjugated I-Ab/M133 tetramers. cells were then stained with anti-PE magnetic microbeads and separated on an MS column. two-tailed unpaired Student\u2019s t tests were used to analyze differences in mean values between groups. differences with values of P 0.05 were considered significant. online supplemental material is available at http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20110236/DC1."}
