{"summary": "human metapneumovirus (hMPV) causes acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) in infants and children. hMPV nucleocapsid protein is the most important viral agent responsible for ARIs in children. human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a recently identified human respiratory pathogen. the viral genome, clinical manifestations, and epidemiology associated with hMPV are similar to those of human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) since its initial identification, hMPV infections have been reported worldwide. in the Netherlands, virtually all children have been exposed to hMPV by the age of five. hMPV N protein shares 42-44% homology of amino acid sequence with hRSV. hRSV N protein used as a reference to evaluate the seroprevalence of hMPV infection in china. the purity of both recombinant N proteins was greater than 90%. the purified proteins were confirmed by Western blot analysis using mouse anti-6His tag monoclonal antibody as the primary antibody. IRDye 680 goat anti-mouse monoclonal antibody as the secondary antibody. to optimize ELISA conditions, we performed chessboard titration tests using the recombinant hMPV and hRSV N proteins. the optimal antigen (hMPV N protein) concentration for ELISA was determined to be 0.25 g/ml for hMPV. positive sera (#596, #112, #267, #126, #260) and negative sera (#34, #99, #100, #150, #207) were tested in plates coated with purified hRSV N protein. western blot analysis was used to show expression of hRSV N protein. the limits of detection were 0.0625 g/ml IgG and 0.125 g/ml IgG. reactions of mouse sera against influenza virus A (subtypes H1-H16), human coronaviruses (229E, HKU1 and NL63) and polyomavirus JC against hMPV and hRSV N protein were evaluated. there was no obvious cross-reaction between those mouse antibodies and the hMPV or hRSV seropositive rates of hMPV were significantly lower than those of hRSV in the age groups of six months to six years. no significant difference was observed in the age groups of one to six months, or six years to 80 years. all serum samples were grouped based on age, as indicated at the bottom of each panel. the geometric mean titers of anti-hMPV IgG and anti-hRSV IgG were significantly higher in the age group of >20 years than in the age group of 20 years. the GMT of anti-hMPV IgG (481) was also lower than that of anti-hRSV IgG (857) in a younger group between six months and six years of age. a total of 160 human serum samples that were seropositive for hMPV or hRSV were randomly selected for ELISA using hMPV N protein or hRSV N protein as the antigen. recombinant hMPV and hRSV N proteins were effectively expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) as soluble proteins. expression and purification of hMPV and hRSV N proteins were examined by SDS-PAGE (upper panels) and Western blot analysis. ELISA performed chessboard titration tests using the recombinant hMPV. hMPV-positive and negative sera samples were identified by Western blot analysis. the optimal antigen (hMPV N protein) concentration for ELISA was determined to be 0.25 g/ml. the difference between the OD450 nm value of positive and negative sera was greatest. positive sera (#596, #112, #267, #126, #260) and negative sera (#34, #99, #100, #150, #207) were tested in plates coated with purified hRSV N protein. ELISA determined the cut-off value for these assays. polyomavirus JC against hMPV and hRSV N protein were evaluated. there was no obvious cross-reaction between the mouse antibodies and the hMPV or hRSV N proteins. however, we did not observe cross-reaction between the hRSV N protein and the hMPV or hRSV N protein. anti-hMPV and anti-hRSV IgG antibodies were detected using the N-ELISA method. all serum samples were grouped based on age. the percentage of positive samples in each group is listed above each data point. hMPV IgG, 556 vs 2599, P = 0.000; for anti-hRSV IgG, 811 vs 2160, P = 0.000; Mann-Whitney U test, P = 0.005) in a younger group between six months and six years of age, the proportion of specimens with a low anti-hMPV IgG titer (1:400) was significantly higher than those with a low anti-hRSV IgG a total of 160 human serum samples that were seropositive for hMPV or hRSV were randomly selected for ELISA using hMPV N protein or hRSV N protein as the antigen. the 1,156 serum samples included in our study were randomly collected in 2008, from individuals receiving routine physical examinations. over 90% of children are seropositive for hRSV by the age of three. the seropositivity of hMPV decreases during the 6 mo-1 year period. hMPV infection occurs earlier than hMPV infection. sensitivity of the ELISA method for detecting hMPV and hRSV was determined by using purified murine specific anti-hMPV or hRSV N IgG. repeated infections of an individual by hMPV and hRSV have been reported [26-29], suggesting immunity against hMPV and hRSV is not solid. the IgG antibody against hMPV is lower than that against hRSV in children between six months and six years of age. our findings provide further information to aid the development strategies to control and prevent hMPV infection. the lysates were centrifuged at 2,500 g for 15 minutes at 4\u00b0C. the supernatant was resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM phosphate at pH7.4) the supernatant was purified using a HisTrap Q FF 5 ml column. the purification of N proteins was evaluated by 12% SDS-PAGE. membranes were washed three times with PBS-0.1% Tween. membranes were then developed using Odyssey (Li-COR Biosciences) or a tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate. western blot analysis was used to determine the optimal concentration of the coated antigen and serum dilution. antibodies were detected by adding 100 l substrate solutions A and B. the reactions were terminated by adding 50 l of 2 M H2SO4. the average OD values for the hMPV-negative human sera samples were also measured. 20 randomly selected positive serum samples in each group were subjected to anti-hMPV and anti-hRSV titer assays. titers were calculated as the highest dilution of a serum showing an OD450 nm reading of two times the mean of the negative serum control. the lysates were centrifuged at 30,000 g for 15 minutes at 4\u00b0C. cells expressing the hRSV N protein were harvested by centrifugation at 2,500 g for 15 minutes at 4\u00b0C. the lysates were centrifuged at 30,000 g for 15 minutes at 4\u00b0C. membranes were washed three times with PBS-0.1% Tween. membranes were then incubated for one hour at room temperature. membranes were then washed three times with PBS-0.1% Tween. 100 l of a 1:200 dilution of serum specimens was added and incubated at 37\u00b0C for one hour. the plates were then washed six times with PBS-0.3% Tween and incubated for one hour with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG diluted 1:40,000. antibodies were detected by adding 100 l substrate solutions A and B. mice sera against hMPV N protein and hRSV N protein were purified using protein-G sepharose column (GE Healthcare) the purified murine IgG against hMPV or hRSV were tested in serial dilutions of two-fold. titers were calculated as the highest dilution of a serum showing an OD450 nm reading of two times the mean of the negative serum control."}
