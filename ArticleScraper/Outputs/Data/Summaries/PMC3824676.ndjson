{"summary": "clinical care of acute respiratory distress syndrome may result in ischemia reperfusion injury to alveolar cells that are poorly ventilated or poorly supplied with blood. combined immunomodulators and antiviral agents significantly reduced mortality in mice infected with the avian influenza virus (AIV) the reduced mortality rate was still relatively high (over 10%) therapeutic uses of the drugs for avian influenza and associated pneumonia are summarized. conventional therapies using only antiviral drugs resulted in 50\u201380% mortality rate. the new therapies with antiviral drugs and immunomodulators reduced the mortality rate to 10\u201350%. however, this was still a high ratio. the highest mortality rate of 73% and the mortality rate for people over 50 years was only 18%. some researchers believe that the infection of avian influenza causes multiple complications in the patient, resulting in multi-organ failure, and may be related to the hyperimmune response to the virus. this cytokine outbreak is likely to lead to cell death. the active neutrophils generate ROS exponentially (over 10 times the rate in the resting cell) the oxidative injuries include lipid peroxidation and detriments to structures and functions of the cell membrane and the organelle membrane. ascorbic acid (VC) is the best choice as it is effective, non-toxic, easy to be absorbed and more stable than the others. there are about 4000 species of 'normal' mammals that synthesize VC, on average 50 mg/kg body weight daily or about 5 g/day (normalized to 70 kg for a human) this amount has been found to be essential for optimum health and resistance to many diseases. continuous increase of alveolar/capillary membrane permeability is the most common damage. mitochondria have a critical role in mediating calcium overload and oxidative damage (e.g., hydrogen peroxide)-induced cell death. some ARDS clinical cares are usually carried out at this time. mechanical ventilation, high-flow oxygen therapy, corticosteroid treatment and inhaled nitric oxide administration may restore the oxygen supply to the poorly ventilated alveolar cells. for both the conditions, IR injury or similar damages may occur. corticosteroid treatment and inhaled NO administration may restore oxygen supply to poorly ventilated alveolar cells. cell death may ultimately result in ARDS care failure and organ death. cells are not protected from Bax (B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)-associated X protein) potential targets of the drugs are marked in green color. CsA blocks the activation of T cells and suppresses the generation of a variety of cytokines. combination of immunomodulators and antiviral agents significantly reduced mortality in mice infected by a high inoculum of influenza H5N1 virus. they used two immunomodulators \u2013 Celecoxib (cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor) and Mesalazine (5-amino salicylic acid) these drugs did not cause significant immunosuppression and hardly influenced the body's immune system against AIV. a recent study has shown that the TLR4 antagonist Eritoran protects mice from lethal influenza infection. Eritoran is an alternative immunomodulator (besides CsA, Celecoxib and Mesalazine, as mentioned above) for controlling the influenza-associated inflammation. treatment with protease inhibitor Ulinastatin could inhibit these destructive processes. suppression of viral replication or assembly has been adopted at the same time. antiviral drugs and the others for AIV infection cure have been adopted. some new anti-influenza drugs have been developed recently. such as mechanism-based covalent NA inhibitors59 and Geldanamycin (an inhibitor of the viral polymerase assembly chaperone Hsp90) high doses of VC have been used for influenza treatments for a very long time;13, 14, 15, 16, 17 CsA has also been used to treat non-organ-transplantation-associated pneumonia. 68 Celecoxib and Mesalazine successfully cured mice infected with H5N1;26 and Ulinastatin has a good curative effect on acute lung injury. delirium, hallucinations or unusual behavior Amantadine antiviral drug, neuraminidase inhibitor The whole course (especially effective at the early stage) Insomnia, dizziness, nervousness and nausea Considering that they work on different cell death pathways, all four categories of drugs might ideally be used in a large combination to reduce the mortality rate. AICT may have additive or possible antagonistic effects on virus replication or induction of a cytokine storm."}
