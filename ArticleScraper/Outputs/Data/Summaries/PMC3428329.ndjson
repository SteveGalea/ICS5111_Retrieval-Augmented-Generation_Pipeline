{"summary": "80% of infectious diseases that recently emerged were zoonotic [2]. the role of wildlife in emerging pathogen transmission to humans and domestic animals has in many cases been pointed out [3]\u2013[5]. however, contact between wildlife and livestock or their environment sometimes result in wildlife diseases with conservation issues [8], [7]. avian influenza viruses (AIV) have been studied since 2004 in the area. they are highly variable and undergo continuous genetic evolution via two mechanisms. these mechanisms contribute to the emergence of new variants with the ability to transmit to new hosts. 603 HPAIV human infections including 356 fatal cases have been reported worldwide since 2003. a seasonal infection pattern was identified in Mallards during autumn and winter, with higher infection rates in early fall. to clear this gap we conducted a 2-year study in the Camargue to investigate the potential influence of hand-reared Mallard releases on AIV dynamics in surrounding wildlife. we tested shot waterfowl before and after hand-reared Mallards were sampled. genetic analyses suggest 76% of hunted Mallards in the Camargue have a captive origin. the infection rates in the different GBF were determined by real-time RT-PCR targeting the conserved M gene of AIV. in 2010 the infection rates ranged between 0 and 24%, being of 8% in the farm infected in 2009. the viral strains involved in the infections observed in 2010 were LPAIV. phylogenetic analysis of four H10N7 Camargue isolates confirmed that they were very closely related to each other and formed a cluster. none were closely related to highly pathogenic viruses (H5N1 or H7N7) that circulated in Europe and Asia. the LPAIV strain A/mallard/Netherlands/9/2005 (H7N7) was closely related to the H10N7 Camargue virus for the M segment, whereas its PB2 segment belonged to a distinct phylogenetic group. the NS, N7 and H10 sequences were closely related to those of the H10N7 Camargue virus but available sequences of two other segments were clearly distinct. the extremities of the N7 segment revealed two characteristics that confirmed the phylogenetic distinction between the H10N7 Camargue strain and those of the american lineage. the focus strain is a low pathogenic one since the HA segment possesses a monobasic cleavage site. no known determinants of adaptation to mammals (humans or mice) were detected. H10N7 Camargue high pathogenicity HA RERRRKKR [60] Present Adaptation to human 2,6 receptor HA H183N [62] Absent High hemadsorption activity (typical of avian viruses) NA 367S, 370S, 372S, 400N, 403W, 432K [63], [64] Present except for the 432 position (432E) initial subtyping, searching for H5, H7, H9, N1, and N7 by real-time RT-PCR led to the identification of an H10N7 strain in the GBF in 2009. the viral strains involved in the infections observed in 2010 were LPAIV. phylogenetic analysis of four H10N7 Camargue isolates confirmed that they were very closely related to each other and formed a cluster. none were closely related to highly pathogenic viruses (H5N1 or H7N7) that circulated in Europe and Asia. the sequences of all segments were closely related to Eurasian strains. 10 sequences were closely related to those of the H10, N7, PB2 and M. available sequences of two other segments (NP and M) were clearly distinct from the H10N7 Camargue strain. however, this relatedness is difficult to interpret since the involved nodes are not strongly supported statistically. the focus strain is a low pathogenic one since the HA segment possesses a monobasic cleavage site. HA, NA and PB2 sequences all presented some typical avian characteristics. no known determinants of adaptation to mammals (humans or mice) were detected. phylogenetic analysis of four H10N7 Camargue isolates confirmed that they were very closely related to each other and formed a cluster. none were closely related to highly pathogenic viruses (H5N1 or H7N7) that circulated in Europe and Asia. PAIV strains we included in our phylogenetic analysis were closely related to Eurasian strains. this finding suggests an ancient Asian origin of this segment. the most closely-related Eurasian strains differed between segments. phylogenies of H10N7 Camargue viruses reconstructed from sequences of the H10, N7, PB2 and M segments.

HA subtype of virus isolates was determined by RT-PCR and sequencing of the HA0 cleavage site region using a set of H10-specific primers. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using maximum parsimony (MP) methods with the dnapars program of the PHYLIP 3.68 package and the maximum likelihood (ML) with the software PhyML 2.4.4. nodal supports were assessed with 100 bootstrap replicates generated for each method. MGB 5\u2032 [6Fam]-CAA-TCA-GAC-GCA-CCA-AT-[MGBNFQ]3\u2032 probe specific of H10 subtype; N7-1260Fw (5\u2032-CAA-TCC-ATG-CTT-TTA-CGT-AG-3\u2032) primers and N7-1334Rv (5\u2032-CTG-TTA-CTT-GTC-CAC-CAT-3\u2032) probe specific of N7 subtype samples were stored in 3 ml of universal transport medium (Biolys kit) and frozen at 80\u00b0C until molecular analysis was performed. RNA isolation from 140 l of each sample was carried out using a Macherey-Nagel NucleoSpin 96 virus system with RNA elution into a final volume of 60 l. HA subtype of virus isolates was determined by RT-PCR and sequencing of the HA0 cleavage site region using a universal set of primers. the NA subtype was deduced from this analysis and confirmed by RT-PCR and sequencing of 172 nt of the NA using a set of H10-specific primers. sequences of the whole viral genome were analyzed with CLC Main Workbench 5.6.1. RNA was eluted in 60 l of RNase-free water and the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 NC regions were amplified as previously described [59] using an anchored (dT)14 oligonucleotide. after purification, the PCR products were sequenced with internal oligonucleotides using a Big Dye terminator sequencing kit and an automated sequencer.
