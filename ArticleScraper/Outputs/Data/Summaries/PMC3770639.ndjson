{"summary": "a detailed description and quantification of contacts in hospitals provides key information for HAIs epidemiology and for the design and validation of control measures. the study included 46 HCWs and 29 patients and lasted for 4 days and 4 nights. transmission may be the result of effective contact, as in the cases of S. aureus [4], [5], K. pneumoniae [6] or rotavirus [7], of exposure to contaminated aerosols, as for M. tuberculosis [8], or the result of exposure to droplets, as for influenza [9]. obtaining reliable data on these behaviors remains a challenge [10] the amount of available data is still very limited, and the longitudinal aspects of contact patterns have not been investigated in detail. we report on the use of wearable proximity sensors [17] to measure the number and durations of contacts between individuals in an acute care geriatric unit. we define two individuals to be in contact during a 20-second interval. a contact is considered ongoing as long as the devices continue to exchange at least one packet for every subsequent 20 s interval. a contact is considered broken if a 20-second interval elapses with no exchange of packets. two nurses were present from 800 am to 700 pm each day. a physiotherapist and a nutritionist were present each day. a social counselor and a physical therapist visited on demand. study duration was divided into 5 daytime periods (700 am to 800 pm) and 4 nights (800 pm to 700 am) daytime periods were divided in morning (700 am to 130 pm) and afternoon (130 pm to 800 pm) shifts. data aggregated on a 1-hour timescale. a contact is considered ongoing as long as the devices continue to exchange at least one packet for every subsequent 20 s interval. a contact is considered broken if a 20-second interval elapses with no exchange of packets. we make the raw data available to the public as Datasets S1\u2013S5. two nurses and two nurses were present from 800 am to 700 am each day. visits allowed from 1200 am to 800 pm but visitors were not included in the study. a signed informed consent was obtained for each participating patient and staff member. the longitudinal evolution of the contact patterns was studied by considering several shorter time intervals. we divided the study duration into 5 daytime periods (700 am to 800 pm) and 4 nights (800 pm to 700 am) daytime periods were divided in morning (700 am to 130 pm) and afternoon (130 pm to 800 pm) shifts. contacts were most frequent between two NURs (5,310 contacts, 38%), followed by NUR-PAR contacts (2,951 contacts, 21%) and by contacts between two MEDs (2,136 contacts, 15%). very few contacts between PATs or members of the ADM group were observed. at-PAT 97 (0.7%) 4,180 (0.6%) Total 14,037 (100%) 648,480 (100%) Numbers in parenthesis give the percentage with respect to the total number and duration of all detected contacts. in the first line, the matrix entry at row X and column Y gives the average number (resp. duration) of contacts between classes of individuals. 63.3% of contacts between NURs and PATs occurred on the morning, 25.5% on the afternoon and 9.2% during the night. figures show the number of contacts per 1-hour periods. contacts of several types in each day, as a function of the hour of the day, show the similarity of the curves in different days. the absolute numbers of contacts varied from one morning (resp., afternoon or night) to the next, but the mixing patterns remained very similar. 6 NURs (representing 16% of all HCWs) accounted for 42.1% of the number of contacts. 44.3% of the cumulated duration of contacts with PATs. the number of distinct individuals contacted by a given individual was also correlated with the total number of contacts of the same individual (r = 0.69) 12500 7.5% 25.9% 1210 (NUR) 22 75.9% 245 7.0% 30.7% 11540 6.9% 32.9% 1181 (NUR) 11 37.9% 221 6.3% 37.0% 10080 6.1% 38.9% 1193 (NUR) contacts were most frequent between two NURs (5,310 contacts, 38%), followed by NUR-PAR contacts (2,951 contacts, 21%), and by contacts between two MEDs (2,136 contacts, 15%). very few contacts between pairs of individuals belonging to specific classes were observed. ADM-ADM 115 (0.8%) 5,580 (0.9%) PAT-PAT 97 (0.7%) 4,180 (0.6%) Total 14,037 (100%) 648,480 (100%) Numbers in parenthesis give the percentage with respect to the total number and duration. on average we recorded 2,265 contacts per morning, 1,041 per afternoon, and 207 per night. number and duration of contacts between individuals in various periods of the days, aggregated over the observation period of 4 workdays and 4 nights. figures show the number of contacts of several types in each day, as a function of the hour of the day, to show the similarity of the curves in different days. the absolute numbers of contacts varied from one morning (resp., afternoon or night) to the next, but the mixing patterns remained very similar. 6 NURs (representing 16% of all HCWs) accounted for 42.1% of the number of contacts and 44.3% of the cumulated duration of the contacts with PATs. the number of distinct individuals contacted by a given individual was also correlated with the total number of contacts of the same individual (r = 0.69) 4% 1207 (NUR) 20 69.0% 252 7.1% 23.7% 12500 7.5% 25.9% 1210 (NUR) 22 75.9% 245 7.0% 30.7% 11540 6.9% 32.9% 1181 (NUR) 11 37.9% 221 6.3% 37.0% 10080 6.1% 38.9% 1193 (NUR) 21 72.4% 180 5.1% 42.1% 9020 5.4% 44.3% Other HCWs 22 75.9% 139 57.9% 100 these results are consistent with previous studies [23], [28] carried out in pediatrics, surgery and intensive care units. the detailed information about the number and duration of contacts also allowed us to highlight the presence of a limited number of \u201csuper-contactors\u201d among HCWs. a large number of contacts could correspond to different situations, namely to contacts with many different patients. the study of the temporal evolution of the numbers of contacts may help envision and discuss changes in the organization of care during epidemic or pandemic periods. the high numbers of contacts during mornings may indicate a potential overexposure to infection for PATs and NURs. this would decrease the density of contacts, in particular between NURs, at each specific moment, while maintaining the daily number and duration of contacts between NURs and PATs. repeating measurements in the same ward and in other wards represents an important step towards understanding the similarities and differences of contact patterns in hospital settings. the use of close-range proximity as a proxy for the transmission of bacterial infection acquired by cross transmission, such as S aureus or Enterobacteriacea, is more questionable. models of transmission within hospitals might be based on contact matrices. they could be used to better understand the epidemiology of different types of microbial agents. the results suggest that data collected over just a few hours might be insufficient. results to HCWs could be an innovative pedagogical tool in health care settings. the study complements previous work [22], [23], [27], [28], [30], [34] and provides data that can be used to explore the spread of infection in confined settings. each node corresponds to one RFID tag and has an attribute \"role\" that indicates the role of the individual wearing the tag: patient (PAT), medical doctor (MED), paramedical staff (NUR) or administrative staff (ADM). each edge has 3 attributes: \u201cNcontacts\u201d, the number of contact events between the corresponding RFID tags; \u201ccumulativeduration\u201d, the total duration of these contacts, and \u201clist_contacts\u201d. dataset S4. Time-resolved contact network for day 4 in gexf format. each node corresponds to one RFID tag and has an attribute \u201crole\u201d. each edge has 3 attributes: \u201cNcontacts\u201d, the number of contact events between the corresponding RFID tags."}
