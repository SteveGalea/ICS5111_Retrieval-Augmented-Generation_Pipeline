{"summary": "children infected with enterovirus exhibit from asymptomatic, mild symptoms (enterovirus-like illness, EVI) to severe forms with neurologic sequelae, cardiopulmonary failure or death. surveillance of EVI is necessary to detect early signals, reduce cluster size, and slow spreading. school children infected with influenza have higher viral loads, longer shedding of viruses, and higher attack rates. this is the first report to demonstrate the results of a newly-developed syndromic surveillance system. cases identified by non-medical professionals for early detection of common pediatric infectious diseases in the community. the aim of this study was to evaluate timeliness and feasibility of the novel SID-SSS routinely operating in schools. there were 1072 preschools (age-group of 0\u20136 year-olds, including daycare, nursery centers and kindergartens), 148 primary schools (7-12-year-olds), 133 secondary schools (13-18-year-olds), 29 universities/colleges/professional schools. the system requires all school nurses or class teachers (for those preschools without nurses) to collect the following two types of data on a daily basis. the team initiated outbreak investigations and control measures. each submitted case was categorized based on syndrome reports rather than absenteeism. symptomatic students detected in classes were telephone-interviewed by teachers. we retrieved the data from 1 January, 2010 to 31 August, 2011 covering all 12 districts of Taipei City. for the quality of the data, the SID-SSS reserves a column to be filled out the subsequent results of physicians\u2019 diagnoses. teachers and nurses can compare the consistency between initial judgments and the follow-up clinical diagnoses from physicians if the school children seek medical care. all 12 districts were classified into the four geographic groups based on their spatial relationships and socioeconomic development status. group A, B, C, and D represented the Taipei Central Businesses District (Taipei-CBD), the para-CBD, the north, and south-east suburban areas. two departments (Education and Social Welfare) to design a more efficient and collaborative infectious disease surveillance system, SID-SSS (http://subweb.health.gov.tw/infection/) the collected real-time data have auto-feedback which links to both these three government agencies and the participating schools and institutions. the system requires all school nurses or class teachers of every enrolled institution to collect the following two types of data on a daily basis. the system requires mandatory reporting of clinical and epidemiologic information (type of the suspected infection, date of symptom onset, and the class, grade, gender and age of the sick student) the SID-SSS can automatically detect the presence and numbers of syndromic cases and school clusters, and capture the secondary cases in schools and from families as well. symptomatic students detected in classes and the families were telephone-interviewed by teachers to find out if their symptoms belonged to any of the aforementioned five categories. in the web-reporting process, school nurses or teachers first selected one of the infectious diseases' syndrome groups from the five categories. in china, nearly 100% of primary and secondary schools had at least one registered nurse on-site in the compulsory education system. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 16.0 (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, IL, USA) the national health insurance research database with over 99% coverage of approximately 25.68 million Taiwan citizens was used as the second external dataset. VI syndromic cases per 1000 students were calculated by the number of the reported cases for each district divided by the total number of children from the registered preschools to secondary schools in that district. the data were ranked as 1st to 5th quantile for different levels of incidences, based on these four geographic groups. the overall absenteeism rate for symptomatic school cases was 96.40% (Table 1). the absenteeism rate was higher in cases of EVI (98.79%) and ILI (96.62%), but lower in those with diarrhea (65.74%). 9.6 99.35 Secondary schools 1307 1.29 96.10 21.81 6.96 3.1 6.9 98.32 Other institutions 106 1 72.64 14.15 0 2.3 1.8 100.00 Red Eye 730 (3.78%) 2.12 66.03 46.44 16.71 2.2 2.2 85.34 Preschools 77 1.33 92.21 20.78 16.88 2.0 1.6 90.91 Primary schools 272 1.41 70.22 46.69 24.63 2.0 1.6 90 the male-female ratio of the syndromic cases was 1.21 (Table 1), much higher than the data (M/F = 1.09) obtained from population-based school children in Taipei. school clusters and family members with similar symptomatic cases were detected as high as 41.72% among all the reported symptomatic cases. the incidence surged from the northern suburb area C to para-CBD districts B and district D. there was a three-week interval between these areas and district C. the ILI had a similar diffusion pattern but with a shorter interval. 97.69%-98.33%) and ILI (98.32%-100%) in the SID-SSS (Table 1) but this consistency was much lower for diarrhea (12.15%-45.45%) the overall right judgment for the four most prevalent pediatric infectious diseases in Taipei by school staff was 95.68%, particularly high consistency with ILI (98.88%) and EVI (97.80%)(p 0.001).

Fig 3. Temporal trends in the incidence rates of EVI (A) and ILI (B) cases among the three age groups in the SID-SSS were compared with those collected from the ED-SSS in Taipei City, 1 January, 2010 to 31 August, 2011. the trend of EVI cases in the SID-SSS had two waves within a year, one in the spring and the other in the autumn. three age distributions of EVI cases in the SID-SSS revealed clear pattern variations. preschool children in the SID-SSS appeared the earliest in Week 25 (one week prior to summer vacation) the correlation between the SID-SSS and the ED-SSS was high through Semester 1, 2 and 3. but low during the Lunar New Year holidays and summer vacation periods. the correlation coefficients were higher in preschool and primary school children. the Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient was the highest in EVI (ranged 0.818\u20130.976) than those of the other three syndrome groups (Table 2). During the three semesters, the Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient was the highest in EVI (ranged 0.818\u20130.976) than those of the other three syndrome groups. time-lag was significantly shortest in preschools (2.5 3.3), followed by primary schools (2.8 4.5) and secondary schools (3.1 5.1) (p 0.001). red eye had the shortest time-lag days (2.2 2.2), but ILI had longer lag days (3.1 8.1) (p 0.001). emergency department-based Syndromic Surveillance System \u201c*\u201d with light purple background indicates the summer vacation: Week 27\u201334, 2010. the trend of EVI cases in the SID-SSS had two waves within a year, one in the spring and the other in the autumn. this pattern was parallel with the ED-SSS. three age distributions of EVI cases in the SID-SSS revealed clear pattern variations. preschool children in the SID-SSS appeared the earliest in Week 25 (one week prior to summer vacation) the correlation coefficients were higher in preschool and primary school children. the correlation was not significant when comparing age-group-specific trends in ILI cases in the SID-SSS with those in the LHID2005 (S1 Table). the incidence rates of this syndrome were higher among children of primary and secondary schools but lower than those in preschools (p 0.001) the ED-SSS in Taipei is a cost-effective electronic system. fees spent on traditional facsimile communication were US$13,200 annually. in 2009, consumables including paper and ink cost US$2,772. the SID-SSS can guide public health professionals in using evidence-based data to implement more effective prevention and control measures. cases with the SID-SSS have better specificity because the sick leave requests were reported only if their absenteeism was associated with infectious diseases. the ED-SSS at selected medical centers offers the medical information all-year-round. ILI cases of preschools, primary, and secondary schools all peaked in the same week, implying the fast antigenic drift of influenza viruses can undergo a rapid spread in all age groups. vaccination of influenza, particularly for novel influenza viruses with pandemic potential, needs to cover both preschool and older school children to quickly reduce the number of susceptible children. the way to improve hygiene for younger-age children is important for parents and child-care personnel. the SID-SSS is not only a reporting system but also a documentation system for all follow-up actions involving a broad spectrum of services. schools are the best place for health control measures (i.e. hygiene behavior) and ideal training sites for prevention measures. schools are the best place for health control measures (i.e. hygiene behavior) and ideal training sites for prevention measures. a novel surveillance through social media [43] could be added to the weaknesses in lower reporting in colleges and universities. our goal is to provide an alternative system to detect potentially pandemic threats from emerging infectious diseases of unknown etiological agents.
