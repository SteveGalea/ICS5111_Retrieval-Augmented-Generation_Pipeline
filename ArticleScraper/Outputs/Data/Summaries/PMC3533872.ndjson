{"summary": "cinnamon water extract (CWE) was administered to mice for 6 days prior to intraperitoneal injection of LPS. serum levels of TNF- and interleukin (IL)-6 were determined 1 hour after LPS stimulation. essential oil and water-based extracts from cinnamon have been shown to be effective against pathogenic microbes, viruses, and various types of tumor cell lines. inflammation is a protective response for removal of exogenous and endogenous harmful substances produced by injurious stimuli. cinnamon bark water extract elevates glucose uptake through the promotion of insulin sensitivity. it inhibits angiogenesis through blocking vascular endothelial growth factor 2 signaling. the observed pharmacological activities may have originated from polyphenolic compounds in CWE. low molecular weight (MW) fraction (below 3 kDa), a middle MW fraction (between 3 kDa and 10 kDa) and a high MW fraction (over 10 kDa) were 60%, 15% and 25% of CWE, respectively. mice fed rodent chow and water ad libitum in a temperature- and humidity-controlled animal facility. macrophages were collected three days later by peritoneal gavage. cells were resuspended in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum. cells were incubated for 3 hours at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. amplification of cDNA was performed in triplicate using a stepOne realtime PCR system. after an initial heat denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 10 min, the PCR conditions were set at 95\u00b0C for 15 s and 60\u00b0C for 1 min for 40 cycles. the GAPDH gene was used as an endogenous control. the samples were diluted with 6x sodium dodecyl sulfate(SDS) buffer. they were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline. Statistical analysis In vivo data are presented as mean SD. difference between the two means was assessed using a non-paired Student\u2019s t-test. mice fed rodent chow and water ad libitum in a temperature- and humidity-controlled animal facility at the medical center of Kyung Hee University Hospital. in vivo LPS injection CWE (20, 100 or 500 mg/kg of body weight) was given to mice via oral gavage for 6 days. each group consisted of 12 mice. dherent cells were removed using the MTT method. cDNA preparation and real-time PCR were performed in triplicate. cDNA was reverse-transcribed using Superscript III reverse transcriptase. the PCR conditions were set at 95\u00b0C for 15 s and 60\u00b0C for 1 min for 40 cycles. for each PCR, a corresponding mRNA sample without RT was included as a negative control. the GAPDH gene was used as an endogenous control. ted with IB, IKK, tubulin, phospho-IB, phospho-IB, phospho-JNK, JNK, phospho-ERK1/2, ERK1/2, phospho-p38, and p38 in TBST overnight at 4\u00b0C. blots were washed with TBST and incubated for 1 hour. rosis factor- and interleukin-6 upon LPS stimulation LPS is an endotoxin originating from the cell walls of gram-negative bacteria. this stimulates the expression of TNF- and IL-6 in monocytes and macrophages. a large quantity of such cytokines in serum results in disseminated intravascular coagulation, multiple organ failure or septic shock. CWE (20, 100, and 500 mg/kg) was orally administered to mice for 6 days before intraperitoneal injection of LPS (1.3 mg/kg) dexamethasone (Dex) (5 mg/kg) was i.p. injected 18 h before intraperitoneal injection of LPS. despite its inhibition of LPS-induced TNF- transcription, the unabated TNF- levels in supernatant must have been caused by prior exposure of cells to CWE. peritoneal macrophages from thioglycollate-injected mice were isolated and treated with varying concentrations of CWE for 24 hours with or without LPS. IB is subjected to phosphorylation mediated by an upstream kinase, IB kinase (IKK), followed by phosphorylation-induced proteosomal degradation. phosphorylation of IB reaches its peak at 5 min after LPS stimulation and then disappears at 15 min while a complete degradation of IB occurs within 15 min. cytoplasm of mammalian cells relay extracellular signals to the nucleus through various signal transduction pathways. we tested whether CWE can inhibit the activation of JNK, p38, and ERK1/2 15 min after LPS stimulation. phosphorylation of p38 and ERK1/2 was reduced at all concentrations tested. degradation of IB and phosphorylation of p38 and ERK 1/2 was detected only in cells treated with the high MW fraction. the inhibitory activity of CWE in vitro is derived from the polyphenol-rich fraction. dexamethasone was used as a reference drug to compare the suppressive activity of CWE in the presence of LPS. a dose-dependent reduction in serum IFN- occurred only between 20\u2013200 mg/kg of CWE. the 500 mg/kg group showed a higher level of IL-6 than the control group. we used peritoneal macrophages isolated from thioglycollate-injected mice to determine the range of CWE concentration representing no cytotoxic activity. concentrations of CWE up to 400 g/ml was not cytotoxic to peritoneal macrophages treated with or without LPS. peritoneal macrophages treated with varying concentrations of CWE for 24 hours with or without LPS (100 ng/ml) cell viability was measured by the MTT assay. data are expressed as the mean SD of two independent experiments. phosphorylation of IB reaches its peak at 5 min after LPS stimulation. phospho- IB disappears at 15 min while a complete degradation of IB occurs within 15 min. concentrations tested and phosphorylation of p38 and ERK 1/2 was inhibited at 100 g/ml of CWE. this suggests that different constituents of CWE may act on these pathways. we separated CWE into a low MW fraction (below 3 kDa) and a middle MW fraction (between 3 kDa and 10 kDa) peritoneal macrophages were pretreated with 120 g/ml of low molecular weight(MW) fraction(L), 30 g/ml of middle MW fraction (M) and 50 g/ml of high MW fraction (H) signaling molecules in whole protein extracts were examined by Western blot analysis. administration of CWE decreased serum levels of LPS-induced TNF- and IL-6. however, such anti-inflammatory activity was attenuated in the high dose group. if used singularly the anti-inflammatory activity of CWE is subjected to dose ranges. further study is required to examine whether the macromolecular polyphenols of CWE exert these anti-inflammatory effects in animal models. authors have no conflict of interests; authors have read and approved final manuscript."}
