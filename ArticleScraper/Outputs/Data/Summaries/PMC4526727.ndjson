{"summary": "the placenta is obligatory for supporting fetal development and growth. the trophoblast layer is composed of multinucleated, terminally differentiated syncytiotrophoblasts and the subjacent mononucleated, less differentiated cytotrophoblasts. the placenta shows intricate signaling mechanisms to regulate these functions. miRNAs from this cluster are the most abundant miRNAs in human trophoblasts. they are primate-specific and are expressed almost exclusively in the placenta. the expression of C19MC miRNAs is seen as early as 5 wk of pregnancy. the expression of C19MCs in placenta-derived mesenchymal stromal cells in vitro has also been documented. the differentially methylated region is hypermethylated in cell lines that do not express C19MCs. expression of C19MC miRNAs in nonexpressing cell lines can be restored using the DNA methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine. the interaction between C19MC miRNAs and Alu repeats remains unknown. a complete qualitative and quantitative assessment of the miRNA landscape in the human placenta remains to be determined. recent reports indicate that certain C19MC miRNAs are aberrantly expressed in specific tumors, possibly reflecting reactivation of the C19MC cluster as a consequence of chromosomal rearrangements. 80% of the short RNAs in the human placenta are miRNAs. chromosome 14 miRNA cluster (C14MC) is another large miRNA cluster that is expressed in the placenta. miR-675 is expressed from the first exon of H19, a large intergenic noncoding (linc) RNA. miR-675 is controlled by the stress-response RNA-binding protein HuR. Deficiency of H19 promotes placental growth, and miR-675 overexpression decreases cell proliferation. other miRNAs have been suggested as having defined regulatory functions during early placental development. miR-155 attenuates trophoblast proliferation, acting through regulation of cyclin D1 in the HTR-8/SVneo extravillous trophoblast line. miR-155 also targets interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase M (IRAKM), NFB inhibitor interacting Ras-like 1 (NKIRAS1) and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) CENTAL DISORDERS AND miRNAs Research has uncovered intriguing associations among exposures, pathology, and/or altered miRNA expression landscape. miR-210 targets the 3\u2032-UTR of iron\u2013sulfur cluster scaffold homolog (ISCU), which is down-regulated in preeclampsia and is associated with hemosiderosis in interstitial trophoblasts in certain placental pathologies. miR-376c is down-regulated in preeclampsia, targeting activin receptor-like kinase 5 (ALK5) and ALK7 (Fu et al. 2013a) other miRNAs were shown to be regulated in placentas from preeclamptic women. miR-21 is elevated in FGR-related placentas, potentially silencing the expression of PTEN or cystathionine g-lyase, an enzyme that catalyzes the production of the vasodilator hydrogen sulfide. the level of miR-141, which silences the E2F transcription factor 3 (E2F3) protein and pleiomorphic adenoma gene 1 (PLAG1), is also elevated in F miR-424, which silences FGFR1, is up-regulated or unchanged in placentas in vivo. differences likely represent variability in experimental conditions. altered placental miRNA profiles have been associated with preterm delivery and childhood neurodevelopmental outcomes. transmission of viruses into intrauterine compartment may cause pregnancy loss, fetal death, fetal developmental or growth abnormalities. small RNA molecules have been implicated in antimicrobial defense mechanisms. some miRNAs promote viral replication or pathogenesis, such as the liver-specific miR-122. viral resistance can be transferred to other, nonplacental primary cells and immortalized cell lines by exposing these cells to medium conditioned by PHT cells. this effect is mediated, at least in part, by the release of exosome-packaged C19MC miRNAs. cell transfected with a BAC that harbors the C19MC locus or with individual, highly expressed C19MC miRNAs become more resistant to viral infections. primary human trophoblasts release exosomes containing C19MC (C19) miRNAs. these miRNAs stimulate autophagy in the recipient cells. incoming viruses travel within endocytic vesicles (EV) and are guided into C19-induced autophagosomes (APs) trophoblasts package miRNAs in several forms, including microvesicles, apoptotic bodies, exosomes, or protein-bound. exosomes (50\u2013150 nm in diameter) are generated through a series of endocytic steps. microvesicles (100\u20131000 nm in diameter) originate from direct shedding of the plasma membrane. they contain cholesterol-rich microdomains and associated proteins. vesicles can be separated by differential ultracentrifugation with density-gradient, gel chromatography or fluid-based field-flow fractionation. nonvesicular, protein-bound miRNAs are also taken up by recipient cells. trophomiRs, as well as other types of miRNAs, are present in the maternal circulation during pregnancy. the placenta is capable of releasing different types of vesicles. the placenta is capable of releasing different types of vesicles. a correlation exists between plasma miR-210 and preeclampsia. whitehead et al. have found an association between miR-21 and miR-20b and umbilical cord lactate level. members of the C19MC cluster have been suggested as indicators of response to treatment in women with hydatidiform mole. the discovery of miRNAs and their unique function in the regulation of gene expression has added a new dimension to our understanding of gene regulatory networks. miRNAs, as part of the genetic regulatory networks of two individuals, mediate crosstalk at the placental interface. the identification of miRNA targets has been hampered by the suboptimal performance of miRNA target prediction algorithms."}
