{"summary": "toxoplasma gondii is a common intracellular protozoan parasite that forms a chronic infection in the brain for the lifetime of the host. the infection is controlled, in part, through the effector mechanisms of macrophages that result in the conversion of fast replicating tachyzoites to the slow replicating, cyst forming bradyzoites [1]\u2013[3]. the presence of Toxoplasma cysts in the brain presents a critical and constant danger for the immune compromised patient. cyst burden reaches a peak, declines and becomes stable over time pointing to some form of effector mechanism that can target this stage of the parasite. phages respond to chitin present in the cyst wall and produce the true mammalian chitinase, AMCase. this chitinase activity destroys cysts and is essential for the control of cyst burden within the chronically infected brain. macrophage populations from the infected brain were phenotypically analyzed. C57Bl/6 mice were infected with the Me49 strain of T. gondii. brain mononuclear cells were isolated and analyzed for surface expression of CXCR3 and MMR. panels from left to right show MMR (green), Iba-1+ macrophages (red) and merged images in the infected brain with DAPI (blue) scale bar = 21 m. BMNCs were isolated from mice at 4 weeks p.i. and CD11b+ cells were magnetically purified by positive selection. cDNA was analyzed for levels of Arginase transcript using qRT-PCR. qRT-PCR was performed on magnetically isolated CD11b+ cells from the brains of naive and infected animals. results show an approximate 3-fold increase in MMR expression in macrophage populations. ndii tachyzoites can induce arginase expression via STAT-6 dependent pathways [46]\u2013[48]. a survival strategy enlisted by the parasite to inhibit killing via NO. tachyzoites, bradyzoites, and cysts were added to bone marrow derived macrophage cultures. tachyzoites (sTAg) and whole cysts (cystAg) were assessed for their ability to induce urea. this significantly increased during AAM polarization with IL-4. tachyzoite infection of macrophages did not lead to significant production of urea. lysates from whole brains were analyzed for chitinase activity fluorometrically. macrophages were cultured with tachyzoites, sTAg, bradyzoites, whole cysts, cystAg, cysts separated by 5 m transwell membranes (cysts/TW), IL-4 or media alone. studies have linked chitinases and chitinase-like proteins to inflammation [58]\u2013[60]. chitinases and chitinase-like proteins are induced during Th2 type immune responses and plays a role in tissue remodeling, fibrosis, and the modulation of both the innate and adaptive immune response. chitinase activity abolished following chitinase treatment of cysts. treatment with IL-4 to induce alternative activation in macrophages did not lead to increased chitinase activity. previous work has shown macrophages in close association with rupturing cysts. cysts are easily identifiable with a highly spherical distinct morphology. chitinase localization in the infected brain revealed distinct cytoplasmic staining of several cells, nearly all within 75 m of a cyst. arrows point to areas of potential cyst rupture coincident with AMCase expressing macrophages and (C) high magnification (scale bar = 13 m) prevailing view is that cysts in the brain remain intracellular within neurons and that CD8+ T cell production of perforin is responsible for cyst clearance. cysts cultured in the presence of macrophages and the chitinase inhibitor allosamidin survived significantly longer than in untreated cultures. the majority of cysts survived the entire 14 hour period when treated with either 100 M or 10 M allosamidin. only AMCase was significantly increased in the brain following Toxoplasma infection. chitinase cells showed a significantly lower baseline level of chitinase. these cells showed a significantly lower baseline level of chitinase and were unresponsive to the addition of cysts. macrophages that were classically polarized with LPS and IFN- showed a defect in chitinase activity and cyst destruction. chitin is the most likely source of alternative activation and not IL-4. chitin is required to lyse cysts in vitro. at least 3 individual experiments with a minimum of n = 6 are represented as mean SEM, * p0.05, ** p0.01 *** p0.001. if the escaping bradyzoites were quickly killed by macrophages or associated immune cells, this could be a mechanism that promotes the persistence of the parasite in the brain. total parasite burden in the CNS as measured by qPCR was significantly greater by more than 2-fold (p = 0.0055) parasite burden was evaluated using stage-specific primers identifying tachyzoite (SAG1), bradyzoite (SAG4), and cyst (MAG1) specific transcripts. Flow cytometric analysis revealed no differences in infiltrating CD4+, CD8+ T cells, or macrophage populations. whole blood samples at days 3, 7 and 14 post infection and analyzed for (A) IFN-, (B) IL-6, (C) MCP-1, (D) TNF-, (E) IL-12p70 (F) results displayed as parasites per mg tissue. brains were harvested and analyzed for cyst burden, cellular composition and histology. macrophage populations from the infected brain were phenotypically analyzed for the expression of known markers of alternative activation. CXCR3 is required for protective immune responses to T. gondii primarily due to its role in Th1 cell recruitment. C57Bl/6 mice were infected with the Me49 strain of T. gondii. brain mononuclear cells (BMNC) were isolated and analyzed for surface expression of CXCR3 and MMR. BMNCs were isolated and analyzed for surface expression of CXCR3 and MMR. BMNCs were isolated from mice at 4 weeks p.i. and CD11b+ cells were magnetically purified by positive selection. expression of CXCR3 is associated with alternative activation of macrophages. expression of the scavenger receptor \u2018macrophage mannose receptor\u2019 (MMR; also known as Mrc1 and CD206) was analyzed. qRT-PCR was performed on magnetically isolated CD11b+ cells. results show an approximate 3-fold increase in MMR expression in macrophage populations. qRT-PCR was performed on magnetically isolated CD11b+ cells. macrophages and microglia in the infected brain produce arginase. qRT-PCR showed almost a 2-fold increase in arginase-1 expression. during chronic T. gondii infection there is a population of AAM in the CNS characterized by expression of CXCR3, MMR, stabilin-1 and production of arginase-1. tachyzoite infection of macrophages did not lead to significant production of urea. this can be attributed to the use of a type II strain which is a weak inducer of arginase-1 [47], [48] this points to components of the cyst wall as the stimulus for AAM. qRT-PCR analysis of chitinase expression from whole brain RNA normalized to GAPDH. BMDM were analyzed for chitinase activity fluorometrically. chitinase activity is significantly increased in the brains of infected mice. studies have linked chitinases and chitinase-like proteins to inflammation [58]\u2013[60] chitinases and chitinase-like proteins to inflammation. chitinases and chitinase-like proteins possess an enzymatically active domain that hydrolyzes the 1\u20134 linkages that exist in chitin [56], [58]. chitinase activity abolished following chitinase treatment of cysts. treatment with IL-4 to induce alternative activation in macrophages did not lead to increased chitinase activity. previous work has shown macrophages in close association with rupturing cysts. chitinase localization in the infected brain revealed distinct cytoplasmic staining of several cells within 75 m of a cyst. chitinase expressing AAM are in close association with cysts in the CNS. arrows point to areas of potential cyst rupture coincident with AMCase expressing macrophages and (C) high magnification (scale bar = 13 m) prevailing view is that cysts in the brain remain intracellular within neurons and that CD8+ T cell production of perforin is responsible for cyst clearance in the brain. cultured in the presence of macrophages and the chitinase inhibitor allosamidin survived significantly longer than in untreated cultures. macrophage chitinase is required to lyse cysts in vitro. chitinase cells showed a significantly lower baseline level of chitinase. these cells showed a significantly lower baseline level of chitinase. BMDM from WT and AMCase/ mice were fluorescently labeled. macrophages that were classically polarized with LPS and IFN- showed a defect in chitinase activity. chitin is the most likely source of alternative activation and not IL-4. chitin is required to lyse cysts in vitro. chitinase dependent cyst lysis in the CNS could benefit the host or the parasite. if bradyzoites are able to propagate and infect new cells, this could be a mechanism that promotes the persistence of the parasite in the brain. total parasite burden in the CNS as measured by qPCR was significantly greater by more than 2-fold (p = 0.0055) parasite burden was evaluated using stage-specific primers identifying tachyzoite (SAG1), bradyzoite (SAG4), and cyst (MAG1) specific transcripts. Flow cytometric analysis revealed no differences in infiltrating CD4+, CD8+ T cells, or macrophage populations. DNA was isolated from the lungs and analyzed for parasite burden using qPCR. results are displayed as parasites per mg tissue. brains were harvested and analyzed for cyst burden, cellular composition and histology. despite dominant Th1 immune response during Toxoplasma infection there exists a population of macrophages in the infected brain which display a distinct alternatively activated phenotype. chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10 are induced by the presence of the proinflammatory cytokine, IFN- [34], [36], [37], [77]. XCL10 was preferentially expressed on macrophages expressing the scavenger receptors MMR and stabilin-1. this suggests an alternatively activated phenotype for these cells. previous studies have established important functions of AAM in the context of helminth infection and wound healing. macrophage chitinase activity in response to chitin-containing pathogens has been shown to inhibit hyphal growth of chitinous fungi such as Candida and Aspergillus [56], [58] a recent study has demonstrated no role for AMCase in the generation of allergic airway pathology. chitinase-like induction of chitinase activity implies that macrophages have access to the chitin in the cyst wall prior to chitinase-mediated cyst destruction. chitin dependent induction implies that macrophages have access to the chitin in the cyst wall prior to chitinase-mediated cyst destruction. macrophages that are more easily alternatively activated had enhanced cyst lysis activity compared to C57Bl/6. this may be one explanation for increased resistance to toxoplasmic encephalitis in BALB/c mice [30], [88] the protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of California, Riverside. mice and parasites T. gondii Pruigniund and RH strains were maintained in vitro. mice were backcrossed to C57BL/6NTac:129SvEvBrd for at least 10 generations. mice were generated and maintained under IACUC protocols established by Pfizer.
