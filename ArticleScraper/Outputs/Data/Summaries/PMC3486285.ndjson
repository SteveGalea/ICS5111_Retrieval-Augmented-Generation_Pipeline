{"summary": "the family Flaviviridae, consisting of the Flavivirus, Pestivirus, and Hepacivirus genera, causes a significant worldwide disease burden. Viruses in the Flavivirus genus have similar genome organization and replication strategies. translation of the viral positive-sense genomic RNA produces a polyprotein that is co- and posttranslationally cleaved by host and viral proteases. the bovine homolog of this factor, Jiv, is essential for polyprotein cleavage and replication of the pestivirus bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) it acts as a cofactor for NS2-3 cleavage by the NS2 autoprotease (27, 38, 44) endogenous DNAJC14 colocalized with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in YFV-infected cells. despite extensive progress in the characterization of flaviviral RCs, the mechanism by which viral proteins interact with host factors to assemble the RC is unknown. -14384 TTTCTCGAGTCAACGTTGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG CGTTTTTTGCTGCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCT pTrip-EGFP-hDNAJC14-FL was generated by PCR amplification using primers RU-O-14383 and RU-O-14384.

RT with random primers and the Superscript III first-strand synthesis kit. each sample was reverse transcribed in triplicate. the primers used for YFV genome amplification were as described previously. proteinase K digestion efficiency and ER membrane integrity were monitored. antibody recognizes the calnexin N terminus within the ER lumen. proteinase K digested all of the C termini, indicating the DNAJC14 C terminus resides in the cytoplasm. GFP-FL, GFP-NT3, GFP-NT5, and GFP-NT6 were detected for constructs GFP-FL, GFP-NT4, and GFP-NT6. this indicates that the amino-terminal GFP tag for each of these constructs was located in the ER lumen. this indicates that the amino-terminal GFP tag for each of these constructs was located in the ER lumen, even though no signal sequence was present. pTM1 and pTM3 serve as TM domains and both the N and C termini reside on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane. pTM1 and pTM3 serve as TM domains, and both the N and C termini reside on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane. the protected species containing the TM sequence is indicated by the arrowhead. the N-terminal GFP tag location is represented by a circle; green indicates that the GFP was not protected, while red indicates protection from proteinase K digestion. the cells were fixed for immunostaining and observed by confocal microscopy. the DNAJC14 MBD confers detergent resistance and membrane flotation on GFP. SW13 cells were cotransfected to express both GFP and MBD. pTM3 (GFP-NT3, GFP-NT4) or even a portion of pTM3 (GFP-NT4.1) were almost totally membrane associated. similar results were observed with equivalent C-terminally myc-tagged proteins. this data confirm that pTM3 is indeed a TM helix. DNAJC14-CT1 and NS3 colocalized in aggregates that did not appear to be vesicular in nature. NS3-DNAJC14-CT1 colocalized in aggregates that did not appear to be vesicular in nature. yFV NS3 also did not colocalize with ADRP (Fig. 2B, right middle panels) Huh-7.5 cells expressing DNAJC14-FL were therefore infected with YFV (MOI, 5) and fixed late (4 days) after infection. overexpressed DNAJC14 resides in the ER and LD, but during YFV infection, DNAJC14 has reduced association with the LD marker ADRP. SW13 cells expressing myc-tagged NT5CT1 or GFP-pTM were left uninfected or infected with YFV (MOI, 5) and fixed 1 day later. cells were examined by confocal microscopy after staining for myc or NS proteins as indicated. similar results were obtained in independent experiments. mutant constructs with reduced TM3 lengths as small as 19 or 17 amino acids (aa) were able to confer NS3 colocalization on GFP. in contrast, the ER protein calnexin only partially colocalized with NS3. other pTM sequences can also mediate localization to NS protein clustering sites. NS3 and NS4B floated to lighter membrane fractions. GFP fused to third putative TM (GFP-pTM3) floated as efficiently as NS4B. NT5CT1 floated, albeit less efficiently. results show two subregions of DNAJC14, pTM3 and NT5CT1 lacking both pTM and carboxyl-terminal self-interaction domain. NT5CT1 DNAJC14 mutant constructs are associated with YFV NS proteins on DRMs. SW13 cells expressing GFP, GFP-pTM, DNAJC14-FL (A) or NT5CT1 (B) were infected with YFV (MOI, 5) or not infected. BD in DNAJC14 following the pTM3 and before the J domain. we first generated truncated forms of the putative MBD. they examined their relative expression levels and anti-YFV activities. expression levels of the mutant proteins were similar. NT5 truncation constructs NT5.1, NT5.2, and NT5.3 showed a cytosolic pattern. the MBD of DNAJC14 is required for anti-YFV activity. cells were cotransfected with plasmids expressing GFP and MBD-GFP. the majority of NS3, NS4B, calnexin, and DNAJC14 remained with the insoluble fraction. the majority of NS3 was resistant to protease digestion, whereas only a small part of NS4B was resistant to proteinase digestion. a small portion of NS3 remained proteinase K resistant. the YFV RC is on a detergent-insoluble fraction. SW13 cells were infected with YFV (MOI, 5), and permeabilized in situ 1 day later with 50 g/ml digitonin. cells stained with antibodies to dsRNA and DNAJC14, NS3 or NS4B. yFV-infected cells were stained with antibodies to dsRNA and DNAJC14, NS3 or NS4B, as indicated. dsRNA is tightly associated with NS proteins and likely protected within a Triton-sensitive membrane structure. after in situ Triton treatment, the dsRNA remains associated with the NS protein and DNAJC14 network but is more accessible because of the Triton-mediated membrane disruption. the YFV genome in both the S1 and S2 fractions failed to float. this demonstrates that the YFV RC components could survive after Triton solubilization and fail to float. the RC components reside in a Triton-resistant network. YFV RNA levels were quantified by RT-qPCR and normalized to the level found in S1 and S2. yFV RNA levels from each fraction were analyzed by Western blotting. endogenous DNAJC14 resides on a Triton-insoluble but nonfloating fraction in the membrane flotation assay. this is in contrast to the behavior of the DNAJC14 pTM or NT5CT1 subdomain, each of which can reside on floating fractions. we analyzed the in situ Triton solubility of DNAJC14 mutant constructs with different flotation behaviors. NS4B was not detected in the NT5 sample because of very efficient transduction levels and the strong inhibitory effect of NT5 on YFV replication. the ability to partition into a Triton-insoluble fraction correlates with DNAJC14-mediated YFV inhibition. in YFV-infected cells, DNAJC14 was redistributed and recruited to a dsRNA-containing network. we then examined if transduced DNAJC14, like endogenous DNAJC14, associate with the YFV RC-containing protein network after in situ Triton solubilization. yFV can overcome DNAJC14-mediated inhibition in DNAJC14-FL-transduced cells. DNAJC14-FL associates with NS3 and NS5 directly or indirectly within a protein-protein interaction network. results imply a protein scaffold within the YFV RC and support presence of a protein-protein interaction between DNAJC14 and components of the YFV RC. overexpression of DNAJC14 mutant constructs unable to enter into this protein-protein interaction network would fail to inhibit YFV replication. fusion of the DNAJC14 self-interaction domain (MDNAJB1C) to MDNAJB1 (MDNAJB1C) did not change localization of DNAJB1. fusion of either the DNAJC14 self-interaction domain (DNAJB1C) to MDNAJB1 (MDNAJB1C) conferred significant anti-YFV activity on DNAJB1. SW13 cells transduced to express the V1 vector alone (V) or the proteins indicated were infected with YFV (MOI, 5). after 1.5 days, they were fixed for immunostaining with anti-myc antibody. we generated constructs expressing GFP fused to the amino termini of DNAJC14 N-terminal truncation constructs containing successively less of the putative TMs. we used selective permeabilization and protection from protease digestion to determine the orientation of DNAJC14 with respect to the ER membrane. cytosolic exposure of the GFP-DNAJC14 fusion proteins to proteinase K would result in release of the protease-resistant GFP domain. protection within the ER lumen would result in protected fragments larger than the intact fusion protein. protease-resistant GFP domain remaining after digestion was detected for constructs GFP-FL, GFP-NT3, GFP-NT5, and GFP-NT6. pTM1 and pTM3 serve as TM domains, and both the N and C termini reside on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane. pTM1 and pTM3 serve as TM domains, and both the N and C termini reside on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane. the protease-resistant GFP domain released by proteinase K is indicated by the diamond. the protected larger species containing the TM sequence is indicated by the arrowhead. the alternative topology of pTM2 is indicated. the intracellular distribution of mutant constructs was examined by immunostaining with anti-myc antibody (green) and confocal microscopy 1.5 days after transduction. SW13 cells were transfected to express GFP or MBD-GFP. cells were stained with antibodies to NS3 or calnexin (green) and NS3 (red) localization. cells were fractionated into membrane (pellet, P) and cytosolic (soluble, S) fractions. similar results were observed with equivalent C-terminally myc-tagged proteins. the pTM region likely mediated DNAJC14 colocalization with the LD marker, since it conferred ADRP colocalization on RFP (RFP-TM, Fig. 2B, left panel, bottom), a heterologous protein that is normally distributed diffusely in the cytoplasm and nucleus. detection of the LD localization is likely due to the high level of protein expressed during transduction and might not reflect DNAJC14's normal localization. NS3-DNAJC14-CT1 colocalized exclusively with NS3 and NS4B. overexpressed DNAJC14 resides in the ER and LD, but during YFV infection, DNAJC14 has reduced association with LD marker ADRP. cells were left uninfected or infected with YFV (MOI, 5) and fixed 1 day later. cells were stained with antibodies against myc, the LD marker ADRP, or YFV NS3 as indicated. we fused pTM3 to the C terminus of GFP and found that it redistributed and colocalized with NS3. mutant constructs with reduced TM3 lengths as small as 19 or 17 amino acids (aa) were able to confer NS3 colocalization on GFP. 1% Triton X-100-treated cell lysates tested if YFV NS proteins were targeted to DRMs. NS3 and NS4B floated as efficiently as NS4B in the presence or absence of YFV infection. NT5CT1 also floated, although less efficiently. NS3 was detected in the precipitated complex, while the ER protein calnexin was not. we were unable to assess the coprecipitation of NS4B because of the presence of a nonspecific band of the same size. the pTM region of DNAJC14 and the NT5CT1 DNAJC14 mutant construct each physically associate with YFV NS proteins in a membrane microdomain. a newly identified MBD is essential for DNAJC14 function. we first generated truncated forms of the putative MBD. we examined the resultant anti-YFV activity and intracellular distribution. mutant constructs failed to localize in the cytosol and resided primarily in the nucleus. these results indicate that the first and second putative -helices in the MBD are required for DNAJC14's maximal antiviral function. we fused the MBD to GFP to examine if the MBD could mediate membrane targeting of GFP and recruitment to YFV NS protein clustering sites. DNAJC14 subdomains colocalized and cofractionated with YFV NS proteins on DRMs. we then examined if viral proteins remained after permeabilization or solubilization. the majority of NS3, NS4B, calnexin, and DNAJC14 remained with the insoluble fraction. compared to NS3, NS4B was solubilized more efficiently, with a greater portion detected in the supernatants (S) the insoluble NS4B was largely protease sensitive. SW13 cells were infected with YFV (MOI, 5), and 1 day later they were in situ solubilized with 1% Triton X-100, fixed, and then subjected to immunostaining. yFV-infected cells were stained with antibodies to dsRNA and DNAJC14, or NS4B, as indicated. NS proteins and DNAJC14 were not completely colocalized. only partial colocalization was noted in some viral studies. failure to colocalize may be explained by differences in the relative antigen abundance of viral proteins and dsRNA. a greater proportion of NS4B than of NS3 was solubilized with Triton (S1) and the YFV genome (Fig. 7C) failed to be solubilized in the S2 fraction. the YFV RC components could survive after Triton solubilization. proteins from the supernatants (S1 and S2) were precipitated with methanol. pellets from each of the three fractions were solubilized in equal volumes of SDS loading buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. cells expressing DNAJC14 NT5CT1 and NT5CT1 mutant constructs were treated with Triton. lysates were subjected to a sucrose gradient membrane flotation assay. lysates were subjected to a sucrose gradient membrane flotation assay. insoluble fractions (IS) were collected and analyzed by Western blotting. NT5 and FL (each containing the C-terminal self-interaction domain) were partially resistant to Triton solubilization. NS4B was not detected because of very efficient transduction levels. dsRNAs and NS3 and NS4B appeared as a clustered network. in YFV-infected cells, DNAJC14 was redistributed and recruited to a dsRNA-containing network. we then examined if transduced DNAJC14, like endogenous DNAJC14, associates with the YFV RC-containing protein network. in situ solubilization of YFV-infected cells expressing DNAJC14-FL-myc, an S2 fraction was prepared and DNAJC14 was immunoprecipitated using anti-myc antibody. YFV NS3 and NS5 were coprecipitated with DNAJC14-FL-myc, while flotillin-1 and -actin were not. these results imply a protein scaffold within the YFV RC and support the presence of fusion of the DNAJC14 self-interaction domain (MDNAJB1C) to DNAJB1 (MDNAJB1C) did not confer anti-YFV activity. fusion of either the DNAJC14 self-interaction domain (DNAJB1C) to DNAJB1 (MDNAJB1C) conferred significant anti-YFV activity on DNAJB1. the DNAJC14 MBD and self-interaction domain together confer anti-YFV activity on a noninhibitory Hsp40 family member. the chimeric proteins were cloned into the V1 plasmid and contained a C-terminal myc epitope tag. DNAJC14 plays a role after viral genome translation, likely in YFV RC function (56). DNAJC14 could be targeted to DRMs within the ER via its TM or MBD. DRMs or lipid rafts provide the platform for lipid and protein interaction. YFV infection does not change the biochemical behavior of GFP-pTM and NT5CT1. in flotation assays both float efficiently in YFV-infected or mock-infected cells. however, YFV infection does not change the biochemical behavior of GFP-pTM and NT5CT1. substantial amounts of YFV NS3, NS4B, and DNAJC14 are retained after in situ Triton solubilization. this protein is solubilized in the supernatant, which indicates efficient removal of lipid components by in situ Triton solubilization. dsRNA staining, used as an RC marker, is not reduced but is enhanced upon in situ Triton solubilization. protein of HCV is required for viral RC assembly (41). ER membrane-shaping reticulon proteins are incorporated into the Bromovirus RC via protein interaction with viral proteins. the ER membrane-shaping reticulon proteins are incorporated into the Bromovirus RC via protein interaction with viral proteins and probably are crucial for maintenance of the RC (11). DNAJC14 has two potential mechanisms for membrane targeting, the TM region and the MBD. each domain can mediate membrane association, but the two may have distinct roles in DNAJC14's normal cellular roles."}
