{"summary": "inTRODUCTION HIV is a devastating disease affecting at least 33 million people worldwide. VOICE trials were not successful, likely due in part to noncompliance (1, 2). several highly effective proteins are being studied as possible microbicides, particularly lectins that bind the glycosylated surface of gp120. recent work specifically addressing lectin cellular toxicity showed that Grft does not activate T cells, minimally alters gene expression, and minimally induces cytokine secretion (14). there is a critical gap in an understanding of how Grft functions so effectively to inhibit HIV infection. gp120 contains between 18 and 33 N-linked glycosylation sites (depending on the virus strain), approximately a dozen of which are high-mannose sites (26\u201329) these high-mannose sites contain several related branched glycans, often having three terminal mannose residues rarely found on mammalian cells. the obligate dimer shows a spectrum essentially identical to that of wild-type Grft (black) the obligate dimer shows a spectrum essentially identical to that of wild-type Grft (black) ohydrate binding site by substitution leads to only a fewfold loss of ability to bind gp120. there appears to be a lack of direct correlation between carbohydrate binding and anti-HIV activity. this leads to a second question: is the role of the dimer critical for efficient Grft function? this work provides evidence that the mechanism of Grft involves multiple subunits binding to gp120. this mechanism may be related to the ability of Grft to alter the conformation of gp120, reducing the potential of gp120 to mediate viral infection. proteins were eluted using 500 mM imidazole, 5 M guanidine hydrochloride, 500 mM NaCl, and 20 mM Tris (pH 8) and refolded by dropwise addition to low-salt refolding buffer. solution was dialyzed in the same refolding buffer at 4\u00b0C overnight. fractions were analyzed on an SDS-PAGE gel to confirm the size. to identify the oligomerization state of the Grft-linker-Grft construct, the experiments were carried out at multiple concentrations. Enhanced van Holde-Weischet analysis (36) resulted in vertical integral sedimentation coefficient distribution, identifying a major species with identical sedimentation coefficients for each concentration. the protein concentrations ranged from 4.2 M (OD230 of 0.3) to 12.6 M (OD230 of 0.9) the partial specific volume of the Grft-linker-Grft construct was determined to be 0.711 cm3/g by protein sequence. the substrate for horseradish-peroxidase (2,2\u2032-azinobis 3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) was added. the signal was determined by measuring the absorbance at 405 nm. all interaction studies were performed with a Biacore T200 instrument. HIV-1 ADA (R5) was a kind gift from Nathaniel Landau (47) pCAGGS-SF162-gp160 (R5) was from Leonidas Stamatatos and Cecilia Cheng-Mayer. pWITO4160 clone 33 (SVPB 18) was from B. H. Hahn and J. F. Salazar-Gonzalez. different concentrations of Grft variants were used to coat a 96-well plate at 4\u00b0C overnight. wells were then washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)\u2013Tween 20 and blocked with bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h. a supernatant containing viral lysate was transferred to a commercial p24 capture ELISA plate. the ratio of the signal at 570 nm to that at 630 nm for each well was calculated. 50 percent effective concentrations (EC50s) were determined using a linear equation fitted between two data points surrounding 50% inhibition. virus lysed using 0.5% Triton X-100 after 2 h of incubation. virus was transferred to a commercial p24 ELISA plate (Immuno Diagnostic) p24 was measured by following manufacturer's instructions. cells were collected, washed with PBS, and concentrated to 2 107 cells per ml. cells were then centrifuged at low speed for 5 min; then 160 l supernatant was removed. Western blotting was carried out using the mouse anti-HIV gp120 antibody. BL21(DE3) competent cells were harvested at 6,000 g for 10 min. the pellet was resuspended in 5 M guanidine hydrochloride, 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM benzamidine, and 20 mM Tris. this allowed complete solubilization of proteins from both the inclusion body and the supernatant upon cell disruption. Grft variants were expressed in minimal media with 15NH4Cl as the only nitrogen source. to dissolve the protein powder after purification, 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) with 5% D2O was used. 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonic acid (DSS) was added for calibration. spectra were collected at 25\u00b0C on a four-channel 600-MHz spectrometer. all experiments were performed on a Beckman Optima XL-I at the Center for Analytical Ultracentrifugation of Macromolecular Assemblies. SV data were analyzed with the UltraScan software (42, 43) 100 ng ADA gp120 (ImmunoDiagnostic) was used to coat each well of a 96-well plate overnight at 4\u00b0C. the plate was blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. a 1:1,000-fold dilution of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid was added. recombinant gp41 protein from the HIV-1(HxB2) strain were covalently immobilized on the carboxymethylated dextran matrix of a CM5 sensor chip in 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.0. a reference flow cell was used as a control for nonspecific binding and refractive index changes. DU422 clone 1 (SVPC5) was from D. Monteriori, F. Gao, C. Williamson, and S. Abdool Karim. pSG3env was from John C. Kappes and Xiaoyun Wu. pSG3env was from John C. Kappes and Xiaoyun Wu. TZM-bl cells stably expressing CD4, CCR5 and CXCR4 coreceptors were maintained in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) the medium was then changed 3 h before the assay and made to a volume of 50 l per well. a serial dilution of Grft variants were added from the top row to the bottom row as follows. the EC50 corresponds to the compound concentration required to inihibit syncytium formation by 50% in the virus-infected CEM cell cultures. different concentrations of Grft variants (3.2 nM, 16 nM, and 80 nM) were preincubated with HIV virions at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. the data are shown as a fold difference relative to the negative control. the data are shown as a fold difference relative to the negative control. the EC50 is plotted on a log scale. obligate griffithsin dimer was designed to detect a linear epitope on gp120. a metal-enhanced 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine (DAB) substrate was then added. the image was processed using a bioimaging system (UVP) this variant, \u201cGrft-linker-Grft OneArm\u201d has one wild-type subunit and one subunit containing the substitutions D30A, D70A, and D112A in its CBS. this triple substitution essentially removes the ability of the subunit to bind mannose (25) three carbohydrate binding sites for each monomer of the linked dimer were also mutated. all six sites were mutated to Ala. this protein had very little function in a pseudoviral assay at the highest concentration tested (>1,000 nM) wild-type Grft and Grft-linker-Grft bind at equally high affinity to gp41 and to gp120. Grift-linker-Grft OneArm binds gp41 less well, at about 20-fold lower efficacy than wild-type Grft. the P values for interactions with gp120IIIB are 0.0001 (wild-type Grft versus Grft-linker-Grft) and 0.0019 (wild-type-Grft versus Grft-linker-Grft OneArm) at concentrations higher than 12 nM, a weak binding signal was observed. dimer Grft-linker-Grft, grft-linker-Grft OneArm, and negative control were injected with immobilized gp120. serial 2-fold analyte dilutions were injected over the surface of the immobilized gp120. the experimental data were fit using a 1:1 binding model (black lines) kinetic interactions obtained for several carbohydrate binding agents (including Grft) with monomeric gp120 were similar if trimeric gp120 was used in SPR-based assays (64). in these experiments, the Grft variant was used to coat a plate, followed by incubation with pseudovirus. one-armed obligate dimer variant was much less potent for each strain tested. EC50s were 84- to 609-fold worse than those for the wild-type protein. ADA showed reduced binding by Grft-linker-Grft OneArm by only 5-fold. 0.0567 0.050 1.2 13.1 3.7 286 PVO.4 0.0445 0.0066 0.0292 0.0013 0.7 6.28 2.5 141 pWITO4160.33* 0.0484 0.015 0.0509 0.087 1 10.9 2.6 225 IIIB (X4) 0.06 0.0 0.06 0.00 1 60.6 19 1,010 Subtype C DU156.12 0.276 0.015 0.205 0.010 0.7 25.8 8.8 93 data suggests that deletion of these two glycans could lead to marked loss of sensitivity to Grft. in the HIV strains tested, there appears to be a high antiviral potency by Grft against HIV-1 strains lacking the glycosylation site at N234, while strains with the glycan site at N295 missing show a somewhat lower sensitivity to Grft. a potentially important aspect of the mechanism of Grft is whether the Grft dimer is able to affect the conformation of HIV-1 gp120. it has been reported that wild-type Grft can affect the structure of gp120 by exposing the CD4 binding site for 6 strains from subtype B and subtype C upon binding. the grft-linker-Grft obligate dimer showed effects in inducing CD4 binding site exposure similar to those of wild-type Grft on 4 strains tested. however, grft requires both arms of the dimer to facilitate CD4 binding site exposure on gp120 in clade B strains. this suggests that HIV strains lacking glycan sites are less sensitive to Grft (12) in each viral strain, Grft-linker-Grft OneArm induces only very low (if any) CD4 binding site exposure in gp120 above the control. soluble CD4 induces dissociation of gp120. it has been reported that soluble CD4 induces dissociation of gp120. it has been reported that soluble CD4 induces dissociation of gp120. soluble CD4 (sCD4) control is able to induce shedding from the surface of each strain, as expected. the subtype B strain JRFL lacks a high-mannose glycan site at N234. the obligate dimer Grft-linker-Grft oneArm also induces shedding. sCD4 (25 g/ml) was incubated with transfected 293FT cells. different concentrations of wild-type Grft (0.1 nM, 1 nM, and 10 nM) or Grft-linker-Grft OneArm (1 nM, 10 nM, and 100 nM) were incubated with env-transfected 293FT cells. this obligate dimer has 6 CBS, 3 on each monomer, with the distance between the carbohydrate binding faces on each subunit being around 47 (23) the distance between the carbohydrate binding faces on each subunit is around 47 (23) 15N correlation spectra of this one-armed dimer show a folded protein with peaks similar to those for both the wild-type protein (likely from the other subunit) and the triple variant reported previously (from the other subunit) (25) this one-armed dimer does have one subunit as a wild-type Grft subunit and the other subunit as a triply mutated Grft subunit. surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis was carried out to obtain more-quantitative results. the experiments showed that Grft-linker-Grft binds immobilized, monomeric gp120 derived from strain ADA and strain IIIB quite well, about 2-fold worse than wild-type Grft. the P values for interactions with gp120ADA are 0.0001 (wild-type Grft versus Grft-linker-Grft) and 0.0027 (wild-type Grft versus Grft-linker-Grft OneArm) the P values for interactions with gp120ADA are 0.0001 (wild-type Grft versus Grft-linker-Grft) and 0.0019 (wild-type Grft versus Gr no specific binding observed at 12 nM (i.e., 24 and 48 nM) a weak binding signal was observed. the experiment was repeated 3 times. Typical results are shown from an experiment in triplicate using ADA. each experiment was repeated at least 3 times. errors indicate standard deviations from a triplicate experiment. obligate dimer inhibited HIV-1 infection by strain ADA at an EC50 of 0.012 nM (compared to 0.011 nM for the wild-type protein) but the one-armed obligate dimer variant was much less potent for each strain tested, with EC50s being 84- to 609-fold worse than those for the wild-type protein. the experiments were carried out with TZM-bl target cells except for the experiments with the X4-tropic strain IIIB. each experiment was independently repeated at least 3 times in triplicate. the two high-mannose glycans at N234 and N295 are important for Grft function. data suggest deletion of these two glycans could lead to marked loss of sensitivity to Grft. glycan sites lacking the glycosylation site at N234 and glycan sites missing show a somewhat lower sensitivity to Grft.

N448) has been shown to result in a marked decrease in the antiviral activity of Grft (12, 33) both subunits of the Grft dimer are critical for its optimal anti-HIV function, but not for gp120 binding. this is generally due to the increased \u201con rate\u201d of the second (later) site after binding at the first site, which leads to overall better binding and less dissociation of the lectin from the virus. grft-linker-Grft OneArm mediates viral capture only at the level of the negative control. this indicates a correlation between the ability to manipulate the structure of gp120 and the anti-HIV activity of the protein. this implicates both arms of the dimer as being necessary for these functions. gp120 is a trimer on the surface of the virus, and the distance between the two arms of Grft (about 47) could allow binding to putative glycosylation sites on two different gp120 monomers in the trimer (23, 85, 86) shedding can occur as part of the conformational change in gp120 (69, 87, 88) griffithsin has been proposed as the first antiretroviral drug in nonclinical use to be included in a microbicide trial for women living with HIV. griffithsin is the first antiretroviral drug in nonclinical use to be included in a microbicide trial. grft inhibition correlates with glycan patterns on the viral surface. previously reported results that HIV strains lacking glycosylation at both positions N234 and N295 are less sensitive to Grft."}
