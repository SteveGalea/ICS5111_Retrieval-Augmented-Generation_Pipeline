{"summary": "the balance between these protective and deleterious effects may ultimately determine the course of disease after viral infection. prostaglandins (PGs) are important regulators of this inflammatory reaction. they are synthesized by cyclooxygenases (COXs) converting arachidonic acid into PGH2. s/PGs negatively affect adenovirus replication, as well as replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 in macrophages. s/PGs are known pathogens in the veterinary field, causing severe diseases in several domestic species. the role of COXs during CoV infection and pathogenesis is not well understood. indomethacin and curcumine were incubated 1 h prior to infection with the inhibitors. cells were fixed at 6 h p.i. with ice-cold methanol. the number of MHV-infected cells were determined by an indirect immunofluorescence assay using anti-MHV antibodies. a one-way ANOVA with the Tukey-Kramer test was performed using GraphPad Prism version 3.00 for Windows. the ability of specific COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitors to reduce MHV infection was determined in similar way as described above. treated with COX-2 siRNAs, COX-2 mRNA levels were decreased with more than 70% compared to control cells. this data shows the requirement of COX-2 activity for efficient MHV replication. the numbers of MHV-infected cells were determined with an indirect IFA. inhibition of COX activity by curcumine and indomethacin resulted in a significant decrease in the yield of infectious viral progeny. the amount of N protein present in cell lysates was analyzed by Western blotting using a polyclonal anti-MHV serum. reduced expression levels of the MHV S protein are likely to explain the lack of syncytium formation after COXs inhibition. caco-MHVR cells were inoculated with DMSO, 20 M indomethacin, or 30 M curcumine. after 1 h, the cells were inoculated with MHV-A59 (m.o.i. = 1). at 6 and 9 h p.i., supernatants were collected and cells were harvested. the relative amount of viral RNA in the drug-treated cells was expressed as a percentage of the average amount of viral RNA in the mock-treated cells. the cells were inoculated with MHV-A59 (m.o.i. = 0.01) for 2 h at 4\u00b0C to allow binding of the virus to the cells without entry. cells were kept in culture medium containing indomethacin until they were fixed at 6 h post-binding. authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
