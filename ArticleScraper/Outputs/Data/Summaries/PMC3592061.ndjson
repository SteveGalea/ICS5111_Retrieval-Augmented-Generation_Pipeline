{"summary": "nonspecific hybridization noise (once considered a major drawback of microarrays) can now be used to detect or implicate novel pathogens in the specimen. microarrays can detect multiple pathogens simultaneously, but their clinical utility has been limited by their sensitivity in clinical specimens (11) resequencing microarrays (24\u201326) and low-density arrays (27, 28) have been used to detect multiple respiratory pathogens simultaneously in clinical samples. the most prevalent PCR methods in clinical use are single-plex kits, which have been widely commercialized and FDA approved for specific pathogens. all hospital admissions and other important medical events were collected until a study termination visit at 23 months of age or the end of study follow-up at the end of December 2004. all children from the 6 barangays who were 5 years of age and who were not in the trial were enrolled in a separate epidemiologic study. separate consent was obtained for each child to obtain a history and specimens. the specimen was cloudy and had mucus and cells, it was immediately placed on ice and transported to the laboratory. it was then mixed with Remel M4 viral transport medium in a 1:1 ratio. batches of specimens were transported to Denver, CO, on dry ice, where they were stored at 86\u00b0C. a positive result was defined as the presence of bright green fluorescence in the cytoplasm of 2 cells. the RNA pellet was dried at 55\u00b0C for 5 min. three aliquots were made, each with 20 l of the RNA, and then stored at 80\u00b0C. 25,000 full-genome sequences of viruses clinically relevant to humans were downloaded from the NCBI taxonomy database. for each viral genome, a probe recognition signature consisting of probes uniformly spaced out across the entire genome was constructed as previously described (15, 17) the samples were then purified, stained, labeled, and hybridized onto the PathChip according to the manufacturer's protocol. a gold standard was developed to test the sensitivity and specificity of the GIS PathChip compared to those of multiplex panel tests. the gold standard was used to classify each specimen by type of viral infection. the gold standard was then used to classify each specimen by type of viral infection. the 12 samples that were not confirmed by other PCR approaches or Sanger sequencing were selected for NGS validation. each sample was amplified using PathChip's random-tagged PCR protocol. the amplified sample was then further processed for MiSeq multiplexing sequencing. the 6 barangays who were 5 years of age were enrolled in a separate epidemiologic study. separate consent was obtained for each child to obtain a history and specimens. in both groups, 5,570 clinical episodes of pneumonia were observed. in both groups, 5,570 clinical episodes of pneumonia were observed. 0.3 ml of specimens were inoculated into a shell vial containing either RhMK (Viromed) or locally made Hep-2 cell. monolayers were scraped after 48 h of incubation at 37\u00b0C. monolayers stained with monoclonal antibodies for influenza A and B. RNA was extracted from 1 aliquot of nasal wash specimen stored in m4 transport medium. a total of 60 l of RNA storage solution was added to the dried pellet. three aliquots were made, each with 20 l of the RNA, and then stored at 80\u00b0C. s of viruses clinically relevant to humans were downloaded from the NCBI Taxonomy database. for each viral genome, a probe recognition signature consisting of probes uniformly spaced out across the entire genome was constructed as previously described (15, 17) the chip design was custom manufactured by Affymetrix, Inc. (Santa Clara, CA), in their GeneChip cartridge format. the gold standard for comparison was considered positive for a virus if that virus was positive for culture or both PCR methods (EraGen and Luminex) the gold standard was then used to classify each specimen by type of viral infection. Sensitivity, specificity, and overall diagnostic accuracy. each sample was amplified using PathChip's random-tagged PCR protocol. the amplified sample was then further processed for miSeq multiplexing sequencing. this generated 3.5 million paired-end reads (2 100 bp) covering 12 samples. parainfluenza viruses (PIV) 1, 2, and 3, influenza (INF) A and B, human rhinovirus (HRV) or enterovirus (EV), and adenoviruses (AD) (Table 1).
