{"summary": "mice were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine, intranasally infected with 105 PFU of MA15 in a 50 l volume, and weighed daily. mice were acclimated to BSL3 housing for a minimum of 7 d prior to infection. histological analysis and hemorrhage Gross pulmonary hemorrhage was observed at the time of tissue harvest. sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) to determine extent of inflammation. the scanone() function fits a model: y i = m + B x i + where yi is the phenotypic value of individual i, m is the population mean, xi is the genotype at a putative QTL. we then used the scantwo() function of R/QTL to assess the likelihood of higher order interactions between pairs of loci. us 2 and Bc is the estimated interaction effect of transitioning between alleles within each locus. y i = m + B a x 1 i + B b x 2 i + e are assessed relative to a null model: y i = m + e. 00708075 Telomere 7 HrS7 Log titer Chr 7 55.169841 96.668697 UNC070369595 117.22358 12.30 HrS8 Log titer Chr 12 81.649471 88.541688 UNC120199018 108.529109 5.40 HrS9 Hemorrhage Chr 15 Centromere 30.785867 UNC150077326 64.430001 9.10 Data availability Complete CC003/Unc and CC053/Unc mice were obtained from the UNC Systems Genetics Core. both male and female mice were used for F1 and F2 studies. both male and female mice were used for F1 and F2 studies.

CC003/Unc haplotype (NOD/ShiLtJ) associated with lower viral titers than CC053/UNC haplotype (WSB/EiJ 81.6\u201388.9 Mb; WSB/EiJ and PWK/PhJ uncertainty 88.9\u2013108 Mb). CC053/Unc haplotypes were broken out based on a homozygous CC053/Unc genotype, a homozygous CC003/Unc genotype, or a heterozygous genotype for day 3 and day 4 weight loss, log10 viral titer, and hemorrhage at the chromosome 18 QTL. a spontaneous mutation in either CC003/Unc or CC053/Unc is the cause of H knockout mice do not test the effect of allelic variation in candidate genes. they can confirm the overall importance of a given gene in phenotypes of interest. Ticam2/ mice had greater SARS-CoV induced weight loss than C57BL/6J control mice. all mice were infected with 105 PFU of mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (MA15) at 9\u201311 wk of age, and monitored daily for weight loss and signs of disease until harvest at 4 d postinfection. F2 mice showed expanded phenotypes, exceeding both the range of weight loss and titer observed in the parents. rrhage was scored at the time of harvest and is shown in (D) titers ranged from 103 PFU per lung to >107 PFU per lung. both male and female F2 mice had similar ranges of weight loss and virus load in the lung. analysis of the chromosome 18 multi-trait QTL indicated a phenotypic contribution of 6.6% of day 3 weight loss, 8.5% of day 4 weight loss, 12.9% of variation in viral titer, 6% of hemorrhage. we found strong support for additive interactions between Hrs5 and Hrs6 for day 3 weight loss (LOD = 8.27, genome-wide P = 0.05 threshold = 6.25) in both figures, the y-axis is viral titers (log10), while the x-axis shows the HrS7 genotype (A/A= CC003 homozygous A/B is heterozygous, B/B is CC053 homozygous) within each x-axis class the genotypes of HrS8 (A) or HrS5 (B) are binned left to right (CC003/CC003 s6 had the CC003/Unc haplotype (C57BL/6J) associated with reduced weight loss as compared to the CC053/Unc haplotype (WSB/EiJ) s6 showed the CC003/UNC haplotype (PWK/PhJ 55.1\u201369 Mb; C57BL/6J 69\u201378 Mb; 129s1SvImJ 78\u201390 Mb; C57BL/6J and 129 phenotypes were broken out based on a homozygous CC053/Unc genotype, a homozygous CC003/Unc genotype, or a heterozygous genotype for day 3 and day 4 weight loss, log10 viral titer, and hemorrhage at the chromosome 18 QTL. we compared the PWK and C57BL/6J genomes on chromosome 18 from 31.2\u201358.6 M Ticam2/ mice showed no notable increase in scoring relative to wild-type control mice despite their increased weight loss. pulmonary hemorrhage scores were significantly higher in Ticam2/ mice at 4 d postinfection. two strains exhibiting extreme responses to SARS-CoV infection predicted multiple QTL driving these extreme responses. we hypothesized that each of those QTL would contrast alleles from unique pairs of founder haplotypes. each locus in an F2 cross can only contrast two haplotypes. TLR4 deficient mice are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV infection. other laboratories have demonstrated the importance of TLRs in host immune response to porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and mouse hepatitis virus (Mazaleuskaya et al. 2012) nonsynonymous mutations in the extracellular domain of TLR4 are rare in human populations. the relatively common Asp299Gly mutation in TLR4 has been shown to interfere with recruitment of MyD88 and TRIF to TLR4. individuals with this mutation are more prone to septic shock. the four Ticam2 missense mutations between PWK and C57BL/6J are predicted to cause two changes in charge, remove a serine residue, and change a cysteine residue to a serine. those mutations may alter the structure of the Ticam2 amino-terminal domain, impact its membrane localization function, or modify the ability of Ticam2 to properly shuttle TLR4 to the endosome following activation. subspecific alleles were present across the five loci within each of the CC lines, strongly suggesting that the extreme SARS-CoV responses we based our F2 cross are due, in part, to interactions between alleles from diverse sets of CC founders. we found evidence for epistatic relationships across three loci in controlling viral load. the genetic variation present in the CC would be a particularly rigorous and effective test of proposed human therapeutics that modulate TLR signaling."}
