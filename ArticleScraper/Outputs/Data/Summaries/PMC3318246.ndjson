{"summary": "HPLC-grade chloroform, ethyl ether, methanol, glacial acetic acid, heptane, hexane, and Sep-Pak C18 cartridges were purchased from Fisher Chemical (Pittsburgh, PA) free fatty acid, cholesterol ester, triglyceride, phospholipid, and rapeseed oil methyl ester standards, as well as boron trifluoride\u2013methanol, potassium chloride, serum samples from sentinel animals were tested quarterly and during the course of this study by using immunoassays. mice minute virus, mouse parvovirus types 1 and 2, Hantaan virus, Encephalitozoon cuniculi, cilia-associated respiratory bacillus, parvovirus NS1, rat parvoviruses, and rat murine virus. 4.1 g TFA per 100 g of diet contained 0.03% myristic (C14:0), 12.53% palmitic (C16:0), 0.22% palmitoleic (C16:1n7), 3.15% stearic (C18:0), 21.78% oleic (C18:1n9), 56.48% linoleic (C18:2n6), 5.28% -linolenic, and 0.26% 1 107 HeLa human cervical cancer cells or HT29 human colorectal cells in 0.1 mL culture media were inoculated subcutaneously on the flank immediately caudal to the right axilla in female (HeLa) or male (HT29) mice. when the tumors reached approximately 1.5 g, the mice were euthanized by CO2 narcosis, and the tumors were placed in ice-cold saline. the human cancer xenografts grew as subcutaneous implants. ophthalmic lubricant was applied to eyes of the rats to help prevent eye irritation and cornea drying. artificial lung and dual perfusion system (Figure 1) is composed of 3 single-line components in one: a peristaltic transducer assembly unit for the pump head, leading from the reservoir and coupling to the artificial lung. the transducer consists of 2 silicone tubes (length, 0.3 m; inner diameter, 1.35 mm; outer diameter, 3.35 mm; catalog no. 427401, Clay Adams Intramedic, Sparks, MD) the inner silastic tube void volume (0.170 mL) was permeable to the surrounding atmospheric gases within the exterior, nonpermeable silicone tubing line. all gas components were adjusted to maintain arterial pO2 at 155 mm Hg, pCO2 at 33 mm Hg, and pH at 7.40. tal adenocarcinoma xenografts were anesthetized and placed side-by-side on the operating table on a heating pad. each tumor rested undisturbed in the warmed environment of the rat. both rats were rotated 180\u00b0 in this supine position to allow access to the posterior epigastric region. a small (2 cm) incision was made at the site of the tumor, and the skin over the inguinal fossa region was removed by retractors. the human tumor tissue and femoral vascular tree were exposed, cleaned, and then covered with a 1-in 1-in. gauze pad. epigastric stalk was cannulated with a winged infusion set (25 gauge 1/2 in., catalog no. CE0197, Terumo) the femoral vein distal to the epigastric stalk was closed off by ligature. the rat was exsanguinated through the carotid catheter, ensuring the tumor was completely isolated from the host. 20 L of physiologic saline containing [methyl-3H]thymidine into tumor DNA was initiated 20 min prior to the end of each experiment by injecting 20 L of physiologic saline into the arterial catheter. at the end of each experiment, tumors were freeze-clamped under liquid nitrogen, weighed, and stored at 85 \u00b0C until analysis. 2,7-13,35-37 Tumor TFA and fatty acid lipid fractions were separated by using silica gel G plates. methyl esters of the fatty acids were analyzed by using a gas chromatograph (model no. HP 5890A, Hewlett\u2013Packard, Palo Alto, CA) cAMP was measured by using 0.2-mL arterial and venous plasma samples. 2,5,6,10,35,39,40 Tumor levels of cAMP were determined by ELISA assay. the same blots were stripped and reprobed with antibodies to AKT, p44/42 ERK1/2, MEK1/2, or phosphoGSK3 (Cell Signaling) the same blots were stripped and reprobed with antibodies to AKT, p44/42 ERK1/2, MEK1/2, or phosphoGSK3 (Cell Signaling), respectively. the female and male athymic nude mice (Hsd:athymic nude-Foxn1nu) and adult, homozygous, athymic, inbred nude rats (Hsd:RH-Foxn1rnu) used in this study were purchased from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN) these animals were maintained in environmentally controlled rooms (25 \u00b0C; humidity, 50% to 55%) with a 12:12-h light mice minute virus, mouse parvovirus types 1 through 3, Theiler murine encephalomyelitis virus, epizootic diarrhea of infant mice, Sendai virus, Mycoplasma pulmoni, mouse hepatitis virus, parainfluenza virus, reovirus type 3, lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus, polyomavirus, Encephalitozoon cuniculi, cilia-associated respiratory bacillus. all procedures for animal use were approved by the Tulane University IACUC. human cervical-derived HeLa and colorectal-derived HT29 cells were inoculated subcutaneously on the flank immediately caudal to the right axilla in female (HeLa) or male (HT29) mice. xylazine (9.9 mg/kg IP) solution (MWI Veterinary Supply, Meridian, IN) delivered through a 25-gauge, 5/8-in. tuberculin syringe and prepped for an aseptic surgical procedure. each rat received a single dose of buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg SC; MWI Veterinary Supply, Meridian, IN) through a tuberculin syringe. pathologically confirmed highly differentiated grade I colorectal adenocarcinoma tumors and the HeLa human cervical adenocarcinoma xenografts were histopathologically confirmed to be poorly differentiated, high grade masses. tumors reached approximately 5 to 7 g, they were prepared for the in situ perfusion procedure. the transducer consists of 2 silicone tubes (length, 0.3 m; inner diameter, 1.35 mm; outer diameter, 3.35 mm; catalog no. 80-1065-91, Piscataway, NJ) the artificial lung consists of medical-grade silastic tubing (length, 0.30 m; inner diameter, 0.76 mm; outer diameter, 1.65 mm; catalog no. 602-235; Dow Corning, Midland, MI) the artificial lung and perfusion line void volume was 0.650 mL. at a flow rate of 0.130 mL/min, blood flow travel time from reservoir to tumors was 5.00 min. peristaltic pump head leading from reservoir to artificial lung (B) rat 1 and rat 2 were prepped for the surgery. the right common carotid artery was exposed and cannulated with a 4-in. a dissecting microscope was used throughout the procedure. 5-0 black braided-silk suture was coursed around both the proximal femoral artery and vein, and two 2-in. lengths were coursed separately around the distal artery and vein. the wound site then was covered with a 2-in. 2-in. gauze pad. both rats were heparinized by the previously inserted carotid catheter. the rat was exsanguinated through the carotid catheter, ensuring that the tumor was completely isolated from the host. the dissecting microscope was repositioned over rat 1 and the tumor arterial and venous catheterization procedure was repeated. once the perfusion pump was engaged for whole-blood perfusion of the tumor, the machine was not turned off. arterial and venous whole blood samples were taken for measurements of pH, pO2, pCO2, glucose uptake and lactate production. arterial plasma TFA were extracted from 0.1-mL arterial and venous samples after addition of heptadecanoic acid. values for total fatty acids represent the sum of the 7 major fatty acids (myristic, palmitic, palmitoleic, stearic, oleic, linoleic, and arachidonic acids) present in blood plasma as free fatty acids, cholesterol esters, triglycerides, and phospholipids as well as other plasma lipids. the tissue lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 g, 4 \u00b0C. total protein (90 g per sample) was separated electrophoretically on a 12% denaturing gel. the same blots were reprobed with antibodies to AKT, p44/42 ERK1/2, MEK1/2, or GSK3 (Cell Signaling) differences between group means were considered statistically significant at a P value less than 0.05. growth rates depended on the type of tumor and strain of the rat. arterial and venous hematocrits were 43.8% 1.5% and 45.7 1.5%, respectively, for HeLa tumors. these values indicate less than 5% hemoconcentration of the blood as it passes through the tumors. glucose uptake, lactate release, and arterial and tumor venous oxygen and carbon dioxide levels were perfused 150 min each. perfusion of tissue-isolated HeLa cervical and HT29 colon cancer xenografts. 0.71 0.08 not

new \u2018artificial lung\u2019 and dual-perfusion system is a major innovation over the original single-perfusion system13 developed in our laboratory in 1985. improvements include reduction in overall line length from 1.95 m (original system) to 0.9 m. the total time for surgical preparation of each tumor remained less than 20 min, with an overall success rate of 100%. the total time for
