{"summary": "inflammation in response to comorbid conditions, such as hypertension and diabetes, may play a proportionally larger role in HFPEF as compared to HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFREF). a common clinical approach involves classifying. ambulatory patients with chronic HF into HF with preserved (50%) or reduced left-ventricular ejection fraction (50%; HFPEF or HFREF, respectively) despite similarities in outcomes, it appears that HFPEF and HFREF represent distinct groups, with many pathophysiological differences, along the continuum of the HF. family cytokine, interleukin-6 (IL-6), in community-based cohorts of healthy controls, and ambulatory HFPEF and HFREF patients. our novel findings suggest elevated plasma levels of TNF receptors, in particular TNFR2, are more closely linked to the pathophysiology of HFPEF than HFREF. diastolic dysfunction analyses could not be performed due to poor echocardiographic visualization in 9 HFPEF patients and 14 HFREF patients. a further 1 HFPEF patient and 7 HFREF patients were excluded from diastolic function analyses due to the presence of severe mitral regurgitation. commercially-available ELISA kits for TNF-, TNFR1, TNFR2 and IL-6 were used as previously described. Detection rates for the ELISAs were 72.4%, 100%, 100% and 81.2%, respectively. cocktail dissolved to achieve a concentration of 10 M bestatin (aminopeptidase inhibitor), 1 M E-64 (aspartyl protease inhibitor), 154 M AEBSF (aspartyl protease inhibitor), 75 nM phosphoramidon (neprilysin inhibitor), 15 nM aprotinin (serine protease inhibitor) and 75 nM leupeptin (cysteine, serine and ACE2 activity was determined from the maximum fluorescence difference between inhibited and uninhibited aliquots. this was normalized to a standard curve for Mca-containing fluorescent peptide. inter- and intra-assay coefficients of variation were 10.2% and 7.5% (n = 10), respectively. eGFR was calculated by the revised four-variable Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation [22]. Left-ventricular hypertrophy was defined as left-ventricular mass index (LVMI) 115 g/m2 for males and 95 g/m2 for females per previously published criteria. all subjects gave written informed consent. index, lateral e' and medial e were used as a binary classifier for diastolic dysfunction. lateral e' and medial e' were used as a binary classifier for diastolic dysfunction. a further 1 patient and 7 patients were excluded from diastolic function analyses due to the presence of severe mitral regurgitation. commercially-available ELISA kits for TNF-, TNFR1, TNFR2 and IL-6 (catalogue no.'s STA00C, SRT100, SRT200 and S6050) were used as previously described.

Elevated TNFR2 was significantly associated with increasing grade of diastolic dysfunction in HFPEF, but not in HFREF. TNFR1 and TNFR2 levels were significantly associated with increasing NYHA functional class in both HPFEF and HFREF. neither TNF, nor IL-6 were significantly associated with diastolic dysfunction or symptom severity in either HF group. ACE2 is a counter-regulatory homologue of angiotensin-converting enzyme. it is a major regulator of endothelial function and myocardial fibrosis. previous reports of plasma ACE2 activity showed an association with clinically diagnosed HFREF, symptom severity and worsening clinical outcomes. the study subjects were predominantly of white race in all study groups (Table 1). HFPEF patients were older (p = 0.003) and significantly more were obese (p = 0.016) and hypertensive than HFREF patients. neither HF group had different gender ratios (p = 0.210), histories of diabetes, peripheral vascular disease (p = 0.234) or atrial fibrillation (AFib; Table 1). 71 (63\u201379) 72 (64\u201380) 0.449 Medical History Smoker, % 18 61 52 0.001 HTN, % N/A 78 60 0.006 DM, % N/A 46 36 0.134 PVD, % 0 10 5 0.071 AFib, % N/A 52 40 0.089 NYHA Class, % 0.072 I N/A 12 22 II N/A 56 47 III N/A 32 28 IV N/A a significantly greater number of HFPEF patients were in AFib on the day of study than HFREF patients. the HFREF group had significantly lower LVEF compared to control and HFPEF groups. both HFPEF and HFREF had greater LV posterior wall thickness (LVPW; p0.001 for both) and mass index (LVMI; p0.001 for both); and average E/e' ratio (p0.001 for.

TNFR1 and TNFR2 levels were significantly associated with increasing NYHA functional class in both HPFEF and HFREF. nor IL-6 were significantly associated with diastolic dysfunction or symptom severity in either HFPEF or HFREF. plasma levels of TNFR1 and TNFR2 were weakly, but significantly, associated with average E/e' ratio in HFPEF (Figure 2B & C), but not HFREF (r = 0.215, p = 0.053; and r = 0.112, p = 0.318, respectively) ACE2 is a counter-regulatory homologue of angiotensin-converting enzyme. it is a major regulator of endothelial function and myocardial fibrosis. previous reports of plasma ACE2 activity showed an association with clinically diagnosed HFREF, symptom severity and worsening clinical outcomes. in comorbidities, age and HF etiology the NYHA class distribution was similar between HFREF and HFPEF. both groups had cardiac hypertrophy and exhibited marked diastolic dysfunction. a greater prevalence of comorbidities might account for similarity in symptoms between HFPEF and HFREF. non-cardiac comorbidities are more prevalent in the HFPEF population. increased TNF-axis inflammation has been linked to an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular and all-cause outcomes in HF [18], [35], [36]. TNFR1 and TNFR2 levels were significantly associated with increasing NYHA class in both HF phenotypes. the differential role of TNFRs might explain why TNF is not associated with function or symptoms. we found TNFR1 to be associated with the greatest number of HF risk factors. TNFR2 might then be a better biomarker for gauging severity of established HFPEF. a downstream approach involving TNFR1 inhibition or TNFR2 potentiation may represent a more effective therapeutic approach for patients with HFPEF [42]. the results reported herein represent a single cross-section across healthy controls, and HFPEF and HFREF patients."}
