{"summary": "the genome sequence of Ae. aegypti is available, but it has not been fully annotated. previous studies identified a series of small ncRNAs in Ae. aegypti and demonstrated their interaction with arboviruses. lncRNAs, once described as dark matter, are involved in many biological processes such as genomic imprinting and cell differentiation. they also play important roles in epigenetic and non-epigenetic based gene regulation [12]. some lncRNAs enhance virus replication or decrease antiviral immunity. just seven loci (bxd, Hsr, pgc, roX1, rox2, sphinx and yar) have been annotated as functional regulatory lncRNAs by experimentally derived data. lncRNAs in Plutella xylostella, a pest of cruciferous plants, were linked to the insect\u2019s resistance to insecticides. the results help better understanding of mosquito-pathogen interactions. we also examined the expression pattern of some selected lincRNAs in response to microbial challenge. the algorithm scans each gap in the read mapping to explore whether the gap is assigned to a valid splice site or can be relocated to a valid splice site without cost. the genes that were annotated as known Ae. aegypti protein-coding genes were discarded. 3,842 potential lincRNAs were identified and used for further analysis. all known lincRNA sequences were mapped to lincRNA_1317 for possible best fitting using RNAhybrid. data from deNV-2 (Jam1409) infected midgut and carcass tissues at 4 days post-infection (dpi) were compared with their corresponding control groups. data from deNV-2 (Jam1409) were given weights depending on their total counts. the TURBO DNA-free kit (Ambion, USA) was used to remove possible genomic DNA contamination in RNA samples. first strand cDNA was synthesized from 2.5 g of RNA using a poly-dT primer and Superscript III reverse transcriptase. 3105 cells were fected with dsRNAs against selected lincRNAs. cells were allowed to settle for 1 h, medium was removed and replaced. cells were also treated with 3 g dsRNA 72 h after primary transfection. new transcripts were identified by large gap mapping of 1,148,814,115 reads of 35 RNA-Seq libraries to the genomic reference (AaegL3.3) we implemented strict mapping criteria (mismatch, insertion and deletion costs: 2: 3: 3 respectively) the large gap mapper algorithm also requires each mapped segment to include at least 10% of the read with minimum length of 17 bases. we discarded 8,795 sequences with potential ORF above 100 aa or conserved protein domains. the remaining sequences were submitted to a coding potential assessment tool. RNAhybrid is a tool for finding the normalized minimum free energy (mfe) of RNA. we did not allow G:U pairing in the seed region (nucleotide 2\u20138) and required miRNA-lincRNA duplexes to have a helix in either side of an internal loop. maximum 5nt were allowed as unpaired nucleotides in either side of an internal loop. Ae. aegypti infected with the wMelPop-CLA strain of Wolbachia (+Wol) and without Wolbachia (-Wol, tetracycline-cured line) were stocks produced previously. for the experiments, 4-day-old female mosquitoes were used from which total RNA was extracted with 6\u201310 adult mosquitoes for each biological replicates. dsRNAs were synthesized to knockdown selected lincRNAs. dsRNAs were synthesized to knockdown selected lincRNAs. dsRNAs were synthesized to knockdown selected lincRNAs. qPCR was performed to confirm the knockdown and the effect of particular lincRNA knockdown on the genomic RNA of DENV-2. each treatment was repeated three times. qPCR was performed to confirm the effect of particular lincRNA knockdown on the genomic RNA of DENV-2. the majority of scaffolds (77%) only contain 1\u20134 lincRNAs, while only 23 Ae. aegypti genome scaffolds contain more than 10 lincRNAs (2%). the majority of scaffolds (77%) only contain 1\u20134 lincRNAs. 8 4,266,046 76 12 400\u20137336 2,087

and 7 lincRNAs had sequence similarity with the genome of Ae. albopictus. 248 and 203 lincRNAs with fold changes above four were identified in the RNA-Seq libraries of midgut and carcass respectively. only 32% of Ae. aegypti lincRNA candidates decreased in response to DENV-2 infection in the mosquito carcass sample. the relative transcript levels of selected numbers of Ae. aegypti lincRNAs were measured by RT-qPCR analysis of Aa20 cells infected with 1 MOI of DENV-2 for three days. three biological replicates were used for each treatment with three technical replicates each. transcript levels of Ae. aegypti lincRNAs were altered in wMelPop-CLA strain of Wolbachia. it was assumed that the upregulation of small ncRNAs in infected cells may result in an enhanced immune response. however, the role of these modifications in the host lincRNA gene expression profile, and potentially in anti-viral responses, is unknown. lincRNAs could be byproducts of mRNA biogenesis or changes in global transcriptional profile due to microbial challenges. lincRNAs could represent a new class of signaling molecules involved in innate immunity or provide a new layer in gene regulation. lincRNA_1317 was highly overexpressed (2.33 fold) in Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes compared with non-infected mosquitoes. lincRNA_1317 was highly overexpressed (2.33 fold) in lncRNAs in response to viral infection. alterations of expression of cellular lncRNAs in HIV-1-infected cells. lincRNA_1317 is not located in any of the known piRNA clusters. lincRNA_1317 has a large impact on lincRNA transcriptome. elements on lincRNA_1317 were identified by calculating the normalized minimum free energy (mfe) of hybridization. for example, more than four recognition sites were predicted for miR-278-5p and miR-252-3p on lincRNA_1317. lincRNAs with multiple recognition sites may actually be competitive inhibitors of miRNA function. lncTar algorithm predicts any interaction between lincRNA_1317 and DENV-2 genome. one potential interaction was predicted in the region 1\u20133370 of lincRNA_1317 and the region of 3210\u20136579 of DENV-2 genome with mfe of -61.73. mosquito lincRNA-protein interactions can be identified using high-throughput sequencing of immunoprecipitated RNA after cross-linking (CLIP-Seq) functional studies could be carried out to characterize immune-related lincRNAs. the involvement of lincRNAs in pathways associated with responses to viral infection makes them interesting candidates as potential targets for manipulation. the majority of scaffolds contain less than five lincRNA loci (80%) but 23 of scaffolds (2%) were enriched with more than 10 lincRNAs. lincRNA distribution among different Ae. aegypti genome scaffolds. t1.19

conservation even among closely related species. 248 and 203 lincRNAs with fold changes above four were identified in the RNA-Seq libraries of midgut and carcass respectively. the majority of differentially expressed lincRNA candidates decreased in response to DENV-2 infection in the mosquito carcass sample. only significantly overexpressed lincRNAs after DENV-2 infection are represented in Fig 5. the expression patterns of almost all the examined lincRNAs were consistent with the RNA-Seq data (adult mosquito carcass sample) transcript levels of several lincRNA genes significantly increased in Wolbachia-infected Ae. aegypti mosquitoes. this may lead to differential regulation of cellular protein-coding genes. mouse bone marrow-derived macrophage (BMDM) model reported a significant upregulation in 72 lincRNAs after treatment with the synthetic bacterial lipoprotein Pam3CSK4. differential expression of approximately 500 annotated mouse lncRNAs was reported during infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [50] lincRNAs are also differentially expressed during infection with various viruses such as sacbrood virus (SBV) and deformed wing virus (DWV only RNAi-mediated silencing of lincRNA_1317 led to enhancement of DENV-2 replication. expression of lincRNA_1317 increased substantially following the progression of infection. lincRNA_1317 was also highly overexpressed (2.33 fold) in mosquitoes. RT-qPCR used three biological replicates, each with three technical replicates. 80% of host cell lncRNAs were upregulated upon an adenovirus infection of human primary lung fibroblast cells. lincRNA_1317 has a large impact on lincRNA transcriptome. lncRNAs derived from transposons and pseudogenes facilitate degradation of lncRNAs in mouse late spermatocytes. lincRNA recognition elements on lincRNA_1317 were identified by calculating the normalized minimum free energy (mfe) of hybridization for each Ae. aegypti miRNA. we also used LncTar algorithm to predict any direct interaction between lincRNA_1317 and DENV-2 genome. one potential interaction was predicted in the region 1\u20133370 of lincRNA_1317 and the region of 3210\u20136579 of DENV-2 genome. the involvement of lincRNA_1317 in host response to viral infection may be through its interactions with regulatory proteins that are involved in epigenetic changes. this interaction has been shown in several examples in mammalian systems, including host-virus interactions in which lncRNAs mediate antiviral responses by controlling the expression of immune-related genes. further studies are required to validate any potential interaction. identified lincRNA candidates in Ae. aegypti and their genome coordinates.
