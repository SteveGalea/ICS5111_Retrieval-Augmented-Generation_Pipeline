{"summary": "the coronavirus genome consists of a 5\u2032 cap, a 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR), open reading frames (ORFs), a 3\u2032 UTR, and a 3\u2032 poly(A) tail. the 5\u2032 two-thirds of the genome consists of two ORFs (ORF 1a and ORF 1b) that encode 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps) with replicase activity. the other one-third of the genome largely coronavirus nsp9 is a replicase protein and has been shown to be associated with polymerase nsp12 (20) poly(C)-binding protein (PABP) is a 70-kDa cellular protein. the binding of PABP to mRNA poly(A) tails is followed by interactions with eIF4G and other translation factors, including eIF4E. coronaviruses employ a translation mechanism (cap-dependent translation) different from poliovirus, the strategy for coordinating the use of the positive-sense genome for translation or replication has yet to be determined. the bovine coronavirus (BCoV) N protein can bind to a poly(A) tail with high affinity. similar results were not found for the binding between N protein and yeast tRNA (lanes 6) or between glutathione S-transferase (GST) and the 32P-labeled 65-nt poly(A) tail. the data suggest that coronavirus N protein binds to poly(A) tail with high affinity. concentration is presented for the gel in the top portion and fits the Hill equation for Kd determination. values in panels D, E, and G represent means SD from three independent experiments. the potential significance of the poly(A)-binding activity of N protein may be further emphasized. decreasing lengths suggest that the length of the poly(A) tail is the main factor for increasing binding efficiency of N protein and PABP to the RNA probes. the Kd for N protein and these non-poly(A) sequences with the 25-nt poly(A) tail was 4-5-fold higher than that for N and the 65-nt poly(A) tail, suggesting that N protein has greater binding affinity for a poly(A) sequence than a non-poly(A) sequence upper and lower portions of Fig. 2A were observed at molar ratios of N/PABP from 65.6 to 5.7 in lanes 3 to 7 (with the increase of PABP), minor (complex 1, indicated by the white dot in lane 3) and major (indicated by the white asterisk in lane 3) RNA-protein complexes were observed. since the major complex in lanes 3 to 7 corresponded to N-RNA complex in lane 2, the preferential binding the 32P-labeled 65-nt poly(A) tail was transfected into cells, followed by UV cross-linking and immunoprecipitation. antibody against PABP or N protein was employed to immunoprecipitate an 70-kDa protein from mock-infected and BCoV-infected cells. antibody against N protein immunoprecipitated an 50-kDa protein from a cell (lane 5) but not the mock-infected cell (lane 3) the results suggest that in addition to PABP, N protein is able to bind to the poly(A) tail in infected cells. coronavirus replication can occur in a modified membrane-associated compartment (32) different known concentrations of N protein and PABP were identified by immunoblotting using antibodies against both N protein and PABP. signals were scanned densitometrically and plotted against the concentration to obtain a standard curve for quantitation of N protein and PABP. translation of DI-EGFP with the 65-nt poly(A) tail was inhibited with increasing amounts of N protein but not PABP or GST. the translation efficiency of DI-EGFP, however, was not altered (data not shown), indicating that N protein at these concentrations had no effect on the translation efficiency of RRL. the amounts of DI-EGFP at various concentrations of N protein were not significantly altered, indicating that the stability of DI-EGFP is not a factor affecting the translation efficiency. it was therefore concluded that N protein is able to inhibit viral translation by binding to the viral poly(A) tail. the levels of DI-EGFP RNA and 18S rRNA were similar between the groups at the same time point as quantified by RT-qPCR. the levels of viral genome (BCoV gRNA) and 18S rRNA were similar between the groups at the same time point. -actin transcript was transfected into HEK-293T cells, followed by transfection of DI-EGFP with the 65-nt poly(A) tail or by infection of BCoV. inhibition of the DI-EGFP translation was observable in cells transfected with the N protein transcript at 3, 8, and 16 h in comparison with those transfected with the His\u2013actin transcript. similar inhibition results were also obtained for cells infected with BCoV (Fig. 4F, a -actin transcript with the 65-nt poly(A) tail was first incubated with N protein to form an N protein-poly(A) complex. expression of -actin transcripts was inhibited with increasing amounts of N protein. however, inhibition was not observed as no significant difference in expression of the poly(A) tail-deficient -actin transcript was observed with increasing amounts of N protein. 1 g of input poly(A) tail-deficient -actin RNA transcript was preincubated with 0, 2, and 4 M N protein. the values shown are relative to the amount of synthesis in the absence of N protein (i.e., 0 M N protein) inhibition of host protein synthesis was not apparent in cells not treated with actinomycin D. however, with actinomycin D treatment, synthesis of host proteins decreased by approximately one-third in comparison with that in cells transfected with the His-tagged -actin transcript or mock transfected. the fact that the efficiency of N protein inhibition was better in actinomycin D-treated cells than in untreated cells. an 84-nt biotinylated RNA was synthesized and incubated with cell lysates. both the N protein and PABP were detected (indicated by asterisks), demonstrating poly(A) tail interaction. however, neither was observed by immunoblotting, confirming that the N protein is able to directly bind to the PABP. a signal at 70 kDa representing the cellular PABP was observed. both the PABP (left portion, lane 6) and N protein (right portion, lane 5) were detected. it was concluded that the poly(A) tail can interact with both the N protein and PABP from infected cell lysates. cell lysates indicate cellular PABP and coronaviral N protein, respectively. asterisk in lane 4 indicates cellular PABP; lane 7 indicates untagged N protein. pulldown assay to determine direct binding between PABP and N protein. eIF4G (left portion, lane 1) and coronavirus nsp9 (right portion, lane 1) were detected by immunoblotting. but they were not observed with the biotinylated RNA containing only the 19 non-poly(A) tail nucleotides. this suggests that the 65-nt poly(A) tail is able to interact with eIF4G and coronavirus nsp9 from infected cell ly coronavirus nsp9 was detected in infected cell lysates in absence of RNase treatment. the poly(A) tail and N protein interact with eIF4G and nsp9. the poly(A) tail interacts with cellular eIF4G and coronavirus nsp9. the arrow indicates the position of 220-kDa eIF4G. the arrow indicates the position of 12-kDa nsp9. poly(A)-bound N protein interacts efficiently with eIF4G but not eIF4E. ated poly(A) tail not bound to N protein, which resulted from insufficient binding of N protein to the biotinylated poly(A) tail due to the reduced amount of input N protein (2 M) the biotinylated poly(A) tail was still able to bind to PABP and then eIF4G and eIF4E, leading to detection of eIF4E (Fig. 8A, lanes 5 to 6, blot 2). y(A) nucleotides followed by 65-nt poly(A) tail incubated with increased amounts (2, 4, and 6 M) of PABP (lanes 1 to 3) or N protein (lanes 4 to 6), followed by a streptavidin pulldown assay and immunoblotting. for lane 7 in blots 1 and 2, biotinylated RNA consisting of 19 non-poly(A) nucleotides followed by the 65- streptavidin beads were incubated with infected cell lysates, followed by a streptavidin pulldown assay and immunoblotting. blots 5 and 8 show detection of N protein, nsp9, eIF4G, and eIF4E by immunoblotting from uninfected cells. reduced amount of eIF4E detected may have resulted from increased level of poly(A)-bound N protein. reduced interaction efficiency between poly(A)-bound N protein and eIF4E may explain results of decreased translation efficiency observed in coronaviruses and host cells. coronavirus N protein binds to poly(A) tail with high affinity. unlabeled competitor was at 1-, 10-, and 100-fold excesses. unlabeled competitor was at 1-, 10-, and 100-fold excesses. complexes 1 to 4 in panel E were predicted to consist of 1 to 4 PABPs, respectively, and the 32P-labeled 65-nt poly(A) tail. a plot of a fraction of bound RNA against the protein concentration is presented for the gel in the top portion. the Kd for N protein and PABP with RNA probes containing the BCoV 3\u2032-terminal 55 nt and poly(A) tails of decreasing lengths increased. the length of the poly(A) tail is the main factor for increasing the binding efficiency of N protein and PABP to the RNA probes. the 32P-labeled poly(A) tail RNA probe was incubated with mixtures containing various molar ratios of N protein or PABP to the poly(A) tail. the EMSA results of N protein binding to the poly(A) tail and the relative binding percentage are illustrated in the upper and lower portions of Fig. 2A. molar ratio of N protein to PABP was from 3.0 to 4.0 (lanes 8 and 9) it was concluded that N protein can compete with PABP for binding to the poly(A) tail in vitro. PABP exhibits better binding affinity to poly(A) tails than N protein. antibody against PABP immunoprecipitated an 70-kDa protein from mock-infected and BCoV-infected cells. however, in Fig. 2B, antibody against N protein immunoprecipitated an 50-kDa protein from a BCoV-infected cell (lane 5) but not the mock-infected cell (lane 3). the results suggest that in addition to PABP, N protein is able to bind to the poly(A) tail in in the poly(A) tail may preferentially bind with PABP during the initial infection but with N protein in the later infection. we hypothesize that such binding may prevent the poly(A) tail on coronavirus RNA from interacting with translation factors, leading to translation inhibition. translation of DI-EGFP with the 65-nt poly(A) tail was inhibited with increasing amounts of N protein but not PABP or GST. translation efficiency of DI-EGFP, however, was not altered (data not shown), indicating that N protein at these concentrations had no effect on the translation efficiency of RRL. the inhibitory effect of translation shown in Fig. 4B may be attributed to interaction between the poly(A) tail and N protein. after in vitro translation in RRL the amounts of DI-EGFP at various concentrations of N protein were not significantly altered, indicating that the stability of DI-EGFP is not a factor affecting the translation efficiency. the values shown are relative to the amount of synthesis in the absence of N protein (i.e., 0 M N protein) the levels of DI-EGFP RNA and 18S rRNA were similar between the groups at the same time point as quantified by RT-qPCR. inhibition of translation by N protein was observable in cells transfected with the N protein transcript at 3, 8, and 16 h in comparison with those transfected with the His\u2013actin transcript. similar inhibition results were also obtained for cells infected with BCoV (Fig. 4F, right portion, and Fig. 4G) BCoV N protein modulates translation of host mRNAs in vitro and in vivo. a -actin transcript with the 65-nt poly(A) tail was first incubated with N protein to form an N protein-poly(A) complex. expression of -actin transcripts was inhibited with increasing amounts of N protein. the values shown are relative to the amount of synthesis in the absence of N protein (i.e., 0 M N protein) the values shown are relative to the amount of synthesis in the absence of N protein (i.e., 0 M N protein) the N protein transcript or his-tagged -actin transcript was independently transfected into HEK-293T cells for 1 h. after addition of actinomycin D, the cells were labeled with [35S]methionine for 8 h. equal amounts of cell lysate were analysed by SDS-PAGE. inhibition of host protein synthesis was not apparent in cells not treated with actinomycin D. interactions between poly(A) tail, N protein, and PABP regulate gene expression. 84-nt biotinylated RNA, consisting of 19 non-poly(A) nucleotides, was synthesized and incubated with cell lysates, followed by a streptavidin pulldown assay and immunoblotting. both the N protein and PABP were detected (indicated by asterisks), demonstrating poly(A) tail interaction. a reciprocal pulldown assay with His-tagged PABP showed that the N protein can physically bind to the PABP from infected cell lysates. both the PABP (left portion, lane 6) and N protein (right portion, lane 5) were detected, suggesting that RNA bridging is not a requirement for the interaction between the two proteins. ylated poly(A) tail were pulled down by streptavidin, followed by immunoblotting. upper and lower asterisks indicate cellular PABP and coronaviral N protein. asterisk in lane 4 indicates cellular PABP; lane 7 indicates untagged N protein. poly(A) tail is able to interact with eIF4G and nsp9, a coronavirus replicase protein that is associated with polymerase nsp12 (20), is essential for replication. to this end, the 84-nt biotinylated RNA described above was used in the streptavidin pulldown assay. eIF4G (left portion, lane 1) and coronavirus nsp9 (right portion, lane 2 and lane 7 were detected in infected cell lysates in absence of RNase treatment. eIF4G was detected in the absence or presence of RNase treatment. it is possible that at least a portion of the detected coronavirus nsp9 is due to its interaction with the N protein. the arrow indicates the position of 220-kDa eIF4G. the arrow indicates the position of 220-kDa eIF4G. the arrow indicates the position of eIF4G. blots 3 (lanes 1 to 3) and 4 (lanes 4 to 6), respectively, interpret that the biotinylated poly(A) tail not bound to N protein. this resulted from insufficient binding of N protein to the biotinylated poly(A) tail due to the reduced amount of input N protein (2 M), was still able to bind to PABP and then eIF4G and eIF4E, leading to detection of eIF4E Lanes 1 to 6 in blots 3 and 4 show detection of input PABP (blot 3) and N protein (blot 4) bound by biotinylated RNA. a fixed concentration (25 nM) of biotinylated RNA consisting of 19 non-poly(A) nucleotides followed by the 65-nt poly(A) tail was incubated with increased amounts (2, 4, and 6 M) of PABP (lanes 1 to s 1 to 4 biotinylated RNA consisting of 19 non-poly(A) nucleotides followed by the 65-nt poly(A) tail was incubated with infected cell lysates collected at 0, 8, 16, and 24 hpi. lane 2 contained infected cell lysates only, followed by a streptavidin pulldown assay and immunoblotting. poly(A) tail is able to interact with eIF4G and eIF4E. but the efficiency is decreased with increasing amounts of N protein. this argument is supported by increased amounts of nsp9 detected (Fig. 8B, lanes 4 to 6, blot 3) poly(A)-bound N protein can interact with eIF4G and replicase protein nsp9. however, the poly(A)-bound N protein cannot interact efficiently with eIF4E. the binding of PABP to a poly(A) tail (39) followed by eIF4G and eIF4E binding is required for efficient protein synthesis. translation inhibition caused by binding of N to the poly(A) tail has not been previously documented for coronaviruses. binding of N to the poly(A) tail can inhibit translation, possibly preventing the use of mRNA for gene expression. coronavirus assembly occurs at the membrane (13), where the N protein concentration is higher than that of PABP. it is possible that for the incoming viral genomic poly(A) tail, the N protein disassociates from all genome regions except the poly(A) tail. once nsp3 is synthesized, it can associate with the N protein and tether the complex to the replication complex at the ER (9, 10). coronavirus 3\u2032 poly(A) tail is a start site for negative-strand RNA synthesis (47), (iii) the poly(A) tail can also be bound by the N protein with high affinity (Fig. 1), (iv) the N protein can interact with viral replicase proteins (8\u201314) and nsp9 (Fig. 5) and participate in replication (15\u201318), and (v) nsp9 is required for coronavirus replication (21). the poly(A) tail of the coronavirus genomic RNA binds to PABP followed by eIF4G and eIF4E, leading to translation inhibition. the poly(A) tail can bind to the poly(A) tail of coronavirus genomic RNA and interact with eIF4G but not with eIF4E, leading to translation inhibition. binding of poly(A) tail to eIF4G leads to translation. binding of poly(A) tail to N protein decreases interaction efficiency. binding of poly(A) tail to eIF4E leads to translation inhibition. t + 65A, 55 nt, 65A, 55 nt + 45A, 55 nt + 45A, 55 nt + 25A, 25A, and BCoV-65nts were produced by PCR using a primer containing 65 and 25 thymidine nucleotides. except for 3 guanosine residues, there are no extra non-adenosine residues in both RNA probes after in vitro transcription. pET32aN, which contains the BCoV N protein gene, was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells, followed by inoculation into LB medium. cells were then induced with isopropyl thio-d-galactoside, harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and then sonicated. eled RNA and N protein were separated on 6% sequencing gels. passive elution was performed, followed by phenol-chloroform extraction. the RNA-protein complexes were resolved on a native polyacrylamide gel. HEK-293T cells were mock infected or infected with BCoV. after 16 h of infection, the 32P-labeled 65-nt poly(A) tail was transfected. cells were subjected to irradiation on ice for 5 min at 254 nm. his-tagged PABP (25 g) was mixed with N protein in 100 l of binding buffer. beads were washed 3 times with 1 ml of binding buffer containing 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 300 mM NaCl, and 0.02% Tween 20. a streptavidin suspension (MagQu) was added to the mixture and incubated for 30 min. the protein-associated beads were boiled with SDS-PAGE loading buffer. the gel was dried and exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film. cell lysates were collected after 3, 8, and 16 h, and equivalent amounts of cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting. the amounts of translated products were normalized with loading control GAPDH and the amounts of DI-EGFP RNA quantified by RT-qPCR. rectum tumor 18 (HRT-18) and HEK-293T cells were obtained from David A. Brian (University of Tennessee) the samples were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. a DNA template containing the 65-nt poly(A) tail and 19-nt non-poly(A) tail was used for in vitro transcription. a primer with a sequence of 5\u2032-T(65)GTGATTCTTCAATTGG-3\u2032 and a primer with a sequence of 5\u2032-T(65)GTGATTCTTCAATTGG-3\u2032 were used for PCR. the supernatant containing the recombinant protein was purified through the 6His tag by immobilized-metal ion affinity chromatography with EDTA-resistant Ni Sepharose excel resin (GE Healthcare) the expressed BCoV N protein also contains His, Trx, and S tag-coding sequences, the molecular weight is estimated to be 65 kDa. lycerol, 3.6 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 82.5 g/ml of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 36% glycerol incubated for 15 min at 37\u00b0C. RNA-protein complexes were resolved on a native polyacrylamide gel in TBE buffer (50 mM Tris, 45 mM boric acid, 0.5 mM EDTA) cells were subjected to irradiation on ice for 5 min at 254 nm with 4,000 W/cm2 using a Spectrolinker (XL-1000; Spectrolinker) cell lysates were collected and treated with RNase mix containig10 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 400 U/ml of micrococcal nuclease, 1 mM CaCl2, 1% aprotinin the beads were washed 3 times with 1 ml of binding buffer containing 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 300 mM NaCl, and 0.02% Tween 20. the same method was employed to analyze proteins from cell lysates interacting with His-tagged N protein or His-tagged PABP in the presence of RNase mix. 1 g of capped transcript was added to a mixture containing 17.5 l of rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL; Promega), 20 U of RNasin RNase inhibitor (Promega), 1 l of amino acid mixture minus methionine, and 20 Ci of [35S]methionine. after incubation at 30\u00b0C for 1 h, the samples were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. HEK-293T cells were infected with BCoV after 8 h of transfection. equivalent amounts of cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting. amounts of translated products were also normalized with loading control GAPDH."}
