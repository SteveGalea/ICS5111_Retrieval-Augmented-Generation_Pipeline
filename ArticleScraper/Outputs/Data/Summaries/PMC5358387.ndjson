{"summary": "human IFIT1 bound the capped-RNAs with apparent affinities of 250 nM and 100 nM. binding strength decreased as stability and proximity of RNA secondary structure to the 5\u2032-end increased. IFIT1 also binds uncapped PPP-RNA, but this is inherently weaker and more sensitive to the presence of predicted secondary structure at the 5\u2032-end. in vitro translation system consists of Krebs extracts programmed with a bicistronic Cap0-mRNA reporter (27) the 5\u2032-cistron expresses a Firefly luciferase (FF) reporter that is translated in a cap-dependent manner, whereas the 3\u2032-cistron expresses a Renilla luciferase (Ren) reporter under the control of an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) from hepati addition of IFIT1 after reporter was preincubated with translation extracts for 10 min resulted in its inhibitory activity being reduced by more than an order-of-magnitude (IC50 > 5 M) this result suggests that optimal IFIT1 activity in vivo is probably only realized in cells that are already expressing the protein before infection. this is likely because of nonspecific binding of IFIT1 to either the IRES, ribosomal RNA (19), transfer RNA (19), or translation factors ( IFIT1\u2013RNA complex purified and crystallized as a dimer with two molecules in the asymmetric unit, but diffracted X-rays to only 2.7. to improve resolution, we mutated the dimerization interface at the C-terminal end of the protein to produce a monomeric version that crystallized in a different space group. 100 (100) 99.7 (95.2) 100 (99.9) Rpim (%) 2.4 (43.8) 4.1 (52.6) 2.4 (36.8) 2.8 (39.6) I/(I> 33.6 (1.74) 22.2 (1.9) 30.3 (1.96) 27.4 (1.78) Redundancy 14.5 (12.4) 14.5 (12.2) 14.2 (9.4) 14.6 (12.3) Refinement Resolution () 40.1\u20131.58 (1.6\u20131.58) 40.3\u20131.69 (1 the structure is similar to the previously determined RNA-bound structure of human IFIT5 (rmsd 1.9 ) and the N-terminal region of human IFIT1 (rmsd 0.8 ) the subdomains are arranged to form a clamp-shaped structure with a central RNA-binding tunnel. about 30\u201340% of the tunnel volume is occupied by bound water molecules (Fig. 2E) overall structure of monomeric, RNA-bound human IFIT1 with subdomains colored according to A. the non-TPR pivot helices 1 and 2 are bridged by loop L1. the loop mediates contacts between subdomains II and III. the sequence of this loop is not conserved, but the insertion is found in almost all IFIT1- and IFIT5-like proteins. IFIT1 and IFIT5 were previously characterized as PPP-RNA binding proteins (17) however, the role of IFIT5 remains restricted to recognition of 5\u2032-phosphorylated RNAs (13, 14, 16) IFIT5 residue positions are offset by 1 or 2 compared with IFIT1 residue positions. ribose sugar pucker adapts by switching from a C2\u2032-endo conformation in the anti-configuration, to C1\u2032-exo in the syn-configuration. in IFIT5, T37 facilitates recognition of a bent/compact PPP conformation. in IFIT5, K48 sits atop the cap-binding residue to block access to the cap-binding pocket. in IFIT1, K49 from its cap-binding loop is facing the solvent. RNA-bound IFIT1 points toward the nearby unoccupied cap-binding pocket. annealing 2Fo\u2013Fc omit map of the m7Gppp-moiety contoured at 1. m7G sits atop a tryptophan residue (W147) making \u2013 stacking interactions. the base is abutted by I183 from the same side as W147. the ribose of m7G is similar in the syn- and anti-modes of binding. replacement of R38 in IFIT1 with T37 in IFIT5 causes it to recognize a more compact conformation of the PPP in a metal-dependent manner. this positions the -phosphate away from the putative cap-binding pocket, causing them to block access to its putative cap-binding pocket. the formation of a positively charged RNA-binding tunnel with an accessible and spatially separated cap-binding pocket in IFIT1 explains, at least in part, why it can m7G base conformations were evident in lower-resolution wild-type m7Gppp-RNA cocrystals. there are no direct hydrogen bonds from the protein toward the base in either conformation. the water H-bonded to Q42 is 3.3 away from N3 in the anti-mode. water at N7 appears to be in two conformations and was modeled as two water molecules. the water at N1 appears only in the Gppp-bound form. the water at N1 appears to be in two conformations. annealing 2Fo\u2013Fc omit map of m7Gppp moiety bound to monomeric IFIT1 N216A contoured at 1. (C) EMSA between IFIT1 and m7Gppp- or Gppp-RNA. lack of N7-methyl appears to enhance RNA binding. EMSA between IFIT1 mutants and PPP-ss44 or OH-ss44. all mutants retain binding to PPP-ss44, confirming that the protein fold is not affected by the mutations. despite these observations, IFIT1 appears not to be selective for N7-methylation. IFIT1 titration resulted in translational inhibition similar to m7Gppp-capped mRNA (IC50 200 nM), highlighting the importance of binding not only the cap, but also the proximal nucleotides. the physiological relevance of Gppp-RNA binding by IFIT1 is unclear. m7Gppp-43 RNA mutated residues involved in cap binding. both R38A and K151M are critical for binding. Y218A and Q42A weakened binding to capped RNA and reduced IFIT1 inhibition. data in the mutational analysis confirm the importance of cap binding and the role of the RNA-binding tunnel in mediating translational inhibition by IFIT1. Table S2 Sequences of in vitro transcribed RNA and DNA oligos. this RNA is similar to GGG42, except that it is designed to have a 5-nt overhang to allow strong IFIT1 binding. it is designed to have a free 3\u2032-end with sequence AAA to improve pCp-Cy5 labeling efficiency. s involved in N7-methylguanosine triphosphate recognition are highly conserved. both substitutions are conservative, because neither would disrupt hydrogen-bonding patterns nor interfere with van der Waals interactions with the cap. human IFIT1B lacks an apparent function in RNA binding. mutation of R255 in human IFIT1 (R255M) was shown to disrupt capped- and PPP-RNA binding. mice lack a bona fide IFIT1 ortholog and instead encode three copies of IFIT1B-like proteins. the absence of N7-methylation and associated positive charge on the base results in >100-fold loss in binding affinity. these proteins also rely on hydrogen bonds targeting groups at the m7G base periphery. onical cap-binding proteins are highly selective for guanine as the base. recognition of the four RNA nucleotides following the cap is conformation-specific and can be divided into two distinct dinucleotide groups diverging between N2 and N3. recognition of the bases is predominantly through sequence-nonspecific van der Waals and stacking interactions. IFIT1 recognizes a wide variety of RNA sequences that may exist at the 5\u2032-end of viral RNA. a small degree of sequence-dependent binding affinity variation may exist because there are two adenine-specific hydrogen bonds at N2 and N4. two views rotated by 180\u00b0 are shown. the dinucleotide conformation resembles that found in CpG dinucleotides of Z-form RNA and UUCG tetraloop sequences (39). IFIT1 has a 6- to 8-nt footprint at the 5\u2032-end of mRNA. cocrystal structures of IFIT1 with longer oligonucleotides (6\u20138 nt in length) revealed extra electron density for only the 5\u2032-phosphate of a fifth nucleotide. residues in the positively charged groove contribute to nonspecific RNA binding. m7GpppNmN- and m7GpppNmNmNm- are capped RNAs that contain ribose N2 methylation only. ribose 2\u2032-O methylation is also predicted to disrupt RNA binding to IFIT1 because of hydrogen bonds with H289. SYBR Gold-stained EMSAs between 0.5 M IFIT1 and differentially methylated m7Gppp-RNA. the dashed lines demarcate lanes with different cap structures. either N1 or N2 methylation of HCoV and GGG42 RNAs is sufficient to disrupt binding with up to 2.5 M IFIT1. at the same concentrations, individual N1 or N2 methylation only partially reduced the interaction between IFIT1 and MHV RNA. this RNA-dependent effect is likely because of the longer overhang and decreased secondary structure stability. the apparent Kd for Cap1-MHV is in the 200\u2013300 nM range. the apparent Kd for Cap0-MHV is 75 nM. EMSAs between 5 M IFIT1 and differentially methylated m7Gppp-RNA. the combination of N1+N2 (i.e., Cap2-RNA) has not been tested with RIG-I. the combination of N1+N2 (i.e., Cap2-RNA) has an additive and potentially synergistic effect in preventing RNA binding. mRNA reduced IFIT1 inhibitory activity in translation assays by 10-fold (IC50 1 M) whereas translation of Cap1- and Cap0N2Me-mRNA was still strongly inhibited by 5 M IFIT1. this finding suggests that N1- or N2-methyl steric hindrance can be overcome at very high IFIT1 concentrations. capped-RNA recognition and 2\u2032-O methyl sensing by IFIT1 are two tightly linked processes that have likely coevolved. human IFIT1 has been shown to inhibit replication of viruses lacking N1 ribose 2\u2032-O methylation. HCoV 229E bearing a D129A mutation in its viral 2\u2032-O MTase gene (18) human IFIT1 bound the capped-RNAs with apparent affinities of 250 nM and 100 nM, respectively. RNA binding is generally sequence-nonspecific and replacing the first 3 nt of HCoV (sequence A). IFIT1 also binds uncapped PPP-RNA, but this is inherently weaker and more sensitive to the presence of predicted secondary structure at the 5\u2032-end (Fig. S1C). this finding is in contrast to IFIT5, which binds PPP-RNA but cannot accommodate capped RNA. istron expresses a Firefly luciferase reporter that is translated in a cap-dependent manner. the 3\u2032-cistron expresses a Renilla luciferase (Ren) reporter under the control of an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) from hepatitis C virus (HCV) titration of IFIT5 in these assays did not produce the same level of translational inhibition (IC50 5 M), consistent with the notion that IFIT5 cannot specifically bind capped-RNA. data are consistent with an IFIT1 antiviral mechanism that is dependent on the recognition of mRNA cap structures to compete with eIF4F (18, 19) 7Gppp-AAAA Data collection PDB ID code 5UDI 5UDJ 5UDK 5UDL Space group P4222 P4222 P4222 Molecule per ASU 1 1 1 1 Cell dimensions a, b, c (111.7, 111.7, 93.2 112.5, 112.5, 93.5 112.4, 112.4, 93.2 111.8, 111.8, 93.0,, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90 all atoms 30.65 27.64 30.61 30.86 Protein 30.7 27.6 30.4 30.9 Ligand\u2013RNA 18.8 17.0 19.3 22.2 Ligand\u2013RNA 49.2 48.5 57.4 62.6 Ligand\u2013ion 32.1 30.8 26.6 39.5 Solvent 34.8 30.8 32.6 32.6 Rms deviations Bond lengths. we demarcate four distinct regions of the tunnel according to their role in RNA binding. we demarcate four distinct regions according to their role in RNA binding. we demarcate four distinct regions according to their role in RNA binding. non-TPR helices 1 and 2 are bridged by loop L1 which houses a highly conserved CHFTW motif. the two non-TPR pivot helices (15/16) connect subdomains II and III. this loop has high B-factors (loop average 61 2, protein average 46 2), whereas in the other it is disordered. the TPR4 loop (green) is also disordered in the structure of N-terminal IFIT1 (4HOU) likely because of the lack of RNA and missing subdomain contacts. IFIT1 RNA-Binding Tunnel Houses a Functionally Distinct Cap-Binding Pocket. IFIT1 RNA-Binding tunnel houses a Functionally Distinct Cap-Binding Pocket. IFIT5 was previously characterized as PPP-RNA binding proteins. the role of IFIT5 remains restricted to recognition of 5\u2032-phosphorylated RNAs. however, there are some key differences. IFIT5 residue positions are offset by 1 or 2 compared with IFIT1 residue positions. the ribose sugar pucker adapts by switching from a C2\u2032-endo conformation in the anti-configuration, to C1\u2032-exo in the syn-configuration. in IFIT5, T37 facilitates recognition of bent/compact PPP conformation. in IFIT5, K48 sits atop the cap-binding residue to block access to the cap-binding pocket. in IFIT1, K49 from its cap-binding loop is facing the solvent. annealing 2Fo\u2013Fc omit map of the m7Gppp-moiety contoured at 1.

(C) EMSA between IFIT1 and m7Gppp- or Gppp-RNA. lack of N7-methyl appears to enhance RNA binding. EMSA between IFIT1 mutants and PPP-ss44 or OH-ss44. all mutants retain binding to PPP-ss44, confirming that the protein fold is not affected by the mutations. despite these observations, IFIT1 appears not to be selective for N7-methylation. the physiological relevance of Gppp-RNA binding by IFIT1 is unclear. but one possibility is that it may facilitate targeting of transient intermediates formed during viral mRNA capping. IFIT1 titration resulted in translational inhibition similar to m7Gppp-capped mRNA. the structure of IFIT1 with PPP-RNA is occupied by molecules from the crystallization solution, which form interactions that mimic cap binding. both R38A and K151M are critical for binding, and K151M reduces IFIT1 inhibition by one to two orders-of-magnitude (IC50 > 5 M) the data in the mutational analysis confirm the importance of cap binding and the role of the RNA-binding tunnel in mediating translational inhibition by IFIT1. Table S2 Sequences of in vitro transcribed RNA and DNA oligos. this RNA is similar to GGG42, except that it is designed to have a 5-nt overhang to allow strong IFIT1 binding. this transcript was prepared with a plasmid and not a DNA oligo. this RNA is similar to GGG42, except that it is designed to have a 5-nt overhang to allow strong IFIT1 binding. it is designed to have a free 3\u2032-end with sequence AAA to improve pCp-Cy5 labeling efficiency with T4 RNA ligase. it was prepared with a plasmid and not a DNA oligo. promoter top strand for all sequences except HCoV and mRNA reporter. the mode of cap binding identified here likely applies to all mammalian IFIT1- and IFIT1B-like proteins. residues involved in N7-methylguanosine triphosphate recognition are highly conserved. mIfit1, mIfit1b, and mIfitc are NP_032357.2, NP_444447.1, and NP_001103987.1 respectively. human IFIT1B lacks an apparent function in RNA binding (12) eIF4E (PDB ID code 1EJ1), CBC (PDB ID code 1H2T) and VP39 (PDB ID code 1V39) these proteins evolved a highly specific cap-binding slot between two aromatic side-chains that engage the methylated guanine in a cation\u2013 sandwich. the absence of N7-methylation and associated positive charge on the base results in >100-fold loss in binding affinity (37). the canonical cap-binding proteins are highly selective for guanine as the base and in particular, its keto form. IFIT1 does not form any keto- or enolate-specific interactions with the base. recognition of the four RNA nucleotides following the cap is conformation-specific and can be divided into two distinct dinucleotide groups. RNA and UUCG tetraloops (39) are tightly sandwiched between multiple protein residues. the second dinucleotide (N3 and N4) adopts A-form helical geometry. the large water network inside the tunnel interacts with all groups of the RNA. V372 could potentially clash with methylation at the N6 position of the first adenosine. the dinucleotide conformation here resembles that found in CpG dinucleotides of Z-form RNA and UUCG tetraloop sequences. IFIT1 forms a positively charged, solvent-exposed RNA binding groove. the groove is contiguous with the RNA-binding tunnel. the analogous region in IFIT5 can apparently bind tRNA. ribose methylation is a molecular determinant of self that can protect mRNA from IFIT1/IFIT1B recognition (18, 19), but the role of N2 methylation in this process is unknown. to gain additional insight into self- vs. nonself-mRNA discernment by IFIT1, we examined the interaction between human IFIT1 and differentially methylated RNA. IFIT1 tunnel van der Waals surface is restricted to interact with RNAs not methylated at these 2\u2032-hydroxyls. the tunnel is restricted to interact with RNAs not methylated at these 2\u2032-hydroxyls. IFIT1 knockout cells were reconstituted with the indicated IFIT1 constructs or GFP. data represent the mean fold-change SD of triplicate measurements of the viral N-gene signal, relative to GFP control (ctrl). EMSAs between 1 M or 2.5 M IFIT1 and differentially methylated m7Gppp-RNA (C) Comparison of IFIT1 binding to 35 nM Cap0-MHV, Cap1-MHV, or N2Me-MHV. recognition of viral, self, or synthetic Cap0-RNAs by RIG-I leads to IFN production, and other ISG up-regulation. IFIT1 targets single-stranded mRNAs, or structured mRNAs if they have an 4-nt overhang, leading to inhibition of mRNA translation. conserved residues mediate 2\u2032-O methyl-sensing and general RNA binding. single N1 or N2 methylation of the reporter mRNA reduced IFIT1 inhibition. translation of Cap1- and Cap0N2Me-mRNA was still strongly inhibited by 5 M IFIT1. at N1, Y157F had only a minor effect on capped RNA binding. mutating either H289 (H289A) or Q290 (Q290E) completely disrupted binding. capped-RNA recognition and 2\u2032-O methyl sensing by IFIT1 are two tightly linked processes that have likely coevolved. IFIT1 R187H disrupts interactions with the cap ribose and bridging triphosphate. IFIT1 binding to 2\u2032-O unmethylated viral RNA is required for its antiviral properties. host cells have evolved as part of their antiviral program, the IFIT proteins. IFIT1 can accommodate bona fide cap in different orientations, but also unmethylated cap, adenine cap, and presumably other structures too. this plasticity may be to allow IFIT1 to maintain a broad spectrum of antiviral activity, and to thwart the ability of viral structures to rapidly evolve. cellular N1 methylation was generally thought to be the primary determinant of self, protecting endogenous mRNAs from IFIT1 recognition. but we found that the ability to discern between Cap0 and Cap1 structures is diminished for one of our RNAs (Fig. 8B), an effect that is possibly linked to its 5\u2032-sequence or secondary structure. newly synthesized mRNAs undergo a pioneer round of translation directed by the CBC (45), which may also offer protection from IFIT1. adenosine N6-methylation of the first transcribed nucleotide is another modification that accompanies ribose N1 methylation on 20\u201330% of cellular mRNAs. m6Am could protect self-mRNAs by disrupting water-mediated interactions and impinging on nearby IFIT1B (which includes mouse Ifit1) is the only other IFIT family member known to specifically recognize capped RNAs to inhibit viral replication. the ability to overcome N1 methylation in an RNA-dependent manner could distinguish IFIT1 from IFIT1B proteins, and may explain why IFIT1 overexpression inhibited wild-type VSV replication (a Cap1-containing ssRNA virus) human IFIT1 can form complexes with other IFIT family members (IFIT2 and IFIT3) and several host factors (17), which could play a role in modulating self- vs. nonself-mRNA recognition and translational inhibition. new research suggests that rendering viruses more susceptible to IFIT1-like antiviral responses is a strategy for the rapid development of live vaccines. IFIT1 monomeric mutants (L457E/L464E or N216A/L457E/L464E) were purified to homogeneity and mixed with molar excess chemically synthesized oligos. crystals were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen without additional cryoprotection, and subsequent structures by rigid body refinement. band densitometry was performed with ImageJ.
