{"summary": "adenoid samples and middle ear washes were obtained from patients undergoing adenoidectomy and tympanostomy. specific DNA or RNA of 9 respiratory viruses and 5 bacteria were extracted and quantified by real-time PCR. at the adenoid, virus and bacteria were similarly detected in both patients and controls. in the united states, approximately 90% of all children develop an episode of OME before they reach school age. the presence of OME is associated with severe negative impact on child development, including hearing loss with long-term consequences for speech and language acquisition, poor school performance, and imbalance issues. denoidectomy in children with OME older than 4 years-old is independently of the adenoid size [12]. no studies have thoroughly studied the association of respiratory pathogenic microbiota between these two niches. the present study was carried out to compare the detection of common respiratory viruses and bacteria in adenoids and middle ear fluid in children with OME. children with OME and adenoid hypertrophy (AH) underwent adenoidectomy and tympanostomy with ventilation tube insertion. all patients were evaluated by otoscopy, audiometry, tympanometry, and nasal endoscopy. all patients followed the vaccination protocols of the Brazilian ministry of health. patients in the control group were immunized with pneumococcus 23-valent vaccine and meningococcus C. adenoids fragments were collected using Beckmann adenoid curette. samples were placed in Eagle\u2019s minimal essential medium (MEM) with 15% of a solution containing 20,000 U/mL of penicillin-streptomycin and 200 g/mL of amphotericin B. samples were tested by real-time PCR for rhinovirus (HRV), influenza virus (FLU), parainfluenza virus (HPIV), syncytial respiratory virus (HRSV), metapneumovirus (HMPV), enterovirus (HEV), adenovirus (HAdV) and human bocavirus (HBoV) all patients were evaluated by otoscopy, audiometry, tympanometry, and nasal endoscopy. AH was defined at nasal endoscopy by the presence of adenoid in contact with the torus tubaris. all patients were under treatment with nasal corticosteroids for at least one month. Specimen collection Fragments of adenoid (surface and stroma) and middle ear washes (MEW) were obtained from all patients under general anesthesia. adenoids samples were placed in Eagle\u2019s minimal essential medium (MEM) with 15% of a solution containing 20,000 U/mL of penicillin-streptomycin and 200 g/mL of amphotericin B. samples were tested by real-time PCR for rhinovirus (HRV), influenza virus (FLU), parainfluenza virus (HPIV), parainfluenza virus (HPIV), syncytial respiratory virus (HRSV), metapneumovirus (HMPV), enterovirus (HEV), adenovirus (HAdV) and human bocavirus (HBoV) at least one virus species was detected in adenoid samples in 32 of 37 (86.5%) patients with OME-AH and in 11 of 14 (78.6%) control patients.
