{"summary": "clinical presentation Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X chromosome-linked, progressive, fatal degenerative muscle disorder affecting approximately 1/3,500-5,000 male births worldwide. signs of disease are visible early in childhood (2-5 years) and comprise a delayed ability to walk or waddling gait, impairment in movements, difficulty in running and frequent falls. progressive muscle weakness and joint contractures lead to loss of ambulation and wheelchair dependency around the age of 9-12. genetics and pathophysiology DMD is caused by mutations in the largest known human gene called dystrophin (DMD), which spans 24 kbs of genomic DNA with its 79 exons. most common mutations are non-randomly distributed deletions (approximately 68%) that may span one or more exons [[25], [26], [27]. altered myogenic signalling causes impaired proliferative capacity exhaustion of the satellite cell pool and replacement of muscle with fibrotic tissue. this effect is further exacerbated by functional ischemia in the affected muscles. the muscle-specific laminin located in extracellular matrix is composed of 2, 1, and 1 chains. 1 and 1 in dark pink denote 1- and 1-syntrophin. cytolinker protein plectin binds -DG and dystrophin. 1 syntrophin binds to the splice variant of nNOS in skeletal muscle termed nNOS. genetics and pathophysiology DMD is caused by mutations in the largest known human gene called dystrophin (DMD), which spans 24 kbs of genomic DNA with its 79 exons. most common mutations are non-randomly distributed deletions (approximately 68%) that may span one or more exons. dystrophin normally functions as an anchor between the actin cytoskeleton and the connective tissue via a sarcoplasmic complex. muscle fibers that lack dystrophin are subjected to increased mechanical stress and are more susceptible to damage upon contraction. altered myogenic signalling causes impaired proliferative capacity exhaustion and replacement of muscle with fibrotic tissue. dystrophin binds to -DG through cysteine-rich domain (Cys) the transmembrane protein family sarcoglycans (SG) connect the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix. the small leucine-rich repeat proteoglycan biglycan in the extracellular binds to - and -SG and -DG. if correction of the reading frame in Becker patients is successful, it would lead to the production of a truncated albeit semi-functional dystrophin transcript coding for a protein isoform that will remain resistant to proteolytic degradation. the restoration of the disrupted open reading frame for DMD transcripts that generate the BMD phenotype has now become the basis of the exon skipping therapeutic approach [53] unmodified ASOs were subject to degradation by endonucleases and/or exonucleases. substitution of the non-bridging phosphate oxygen with a sulphur atom generates the phosphorothioate backbone (PS), which confers increased binding to plasma proteins and resistance to nuclease activity. 2-OMe and 2-MOE ASOs contain a PS backbone and 2-O-substituted oligoribonucleotide segments. both have high nuclease resistance, reduced immune stimulation due to their PS backbone. in PMOs, a third generation ASOs, the deoxyribose moiety is substituted by a morpholine ring while the charged phosphodiester inter-subunit linkage is replaced by a non-i the most commonly used mdx mouse harbours a spontaneous nonsense mutation in exon 23 which results in early termination codon and mild to moderate DMD histopathological features. in the mdx mouse, exon 23 removal does not disrupt the DMD reading frame, allowing for mRNA induction and a little shorter dystrophin production that simulates the Becker phenotype. multi exon skipping (exon 6-8 or exon 6-9) was successfully applied in the golden retriever canine dog model in vitro [81] and in canine X linked muscular dystrophy model CXMDJ in vivo [82]. a point mutation in exon 6 is responsible for the loss of exon 7 in dystrophic CXMDJ dog (A) ultimately resulting to out of frame mRNA (B) and disruption of dystrophin protein production. first experimental clinical trial used 2\u2019-OMe-PS based drug called drisapersen (PRO051/GSK2402968/Kyndrisa) targeting exon 51 was developed by Prosensa, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and lately BioMarin. preliminary data from phase I clinical trial was very encouraging, indicating dystrophin build up in a dose-dependent manner reaching up to 15.6% of that of healthy muscle. eteplirsen (Exondys 51, AVI4658; Sarepta Therapeutics) targeting exon 51 in DMD patients achieved around 42% positive dystrophic fibers when administered intramuscularly to the extensor digitorum brevis in a single-blind placebo-controlled trial [90], [91], [92]. eteplirsen could successfully mediate 51 exon skipping in dystrophic patients [86,92 eteplirsen appears to increase dystrophin positive fibres up to 23% in phase I trials. but the latest data show that eteplirsen may only restore dystrophin up to 0.28%, yielding similar findings with the non-approved drisapersen. both percentage targets mentioned above are far from those highlighted by the statistics obtained in the eteplirsen\u2019s trials. the level of dystrophin expression in 8 patients participating in Phase I/II clinical trial averaged 5.21%, well-surpassing efficacy data reported with the approved drug eteplirsen. the efficacy and safety of golodirsen and of another PMO drug, casimersen (SRP-4503) are currently evaluated in the ongoing ESSENCE phase III double-blinded assessment. high and repeated systemic doses of PMOs are necessary to achieve upregulation of dystrophin in skeletal muscles in animal models [82,113] without any significant effect in diaphragm or heart. eteplirsen has the potential to penetrate leaky muscle cells to exert its therapeutic effect. eteplirsen has the potential to penetrate leaky muscle cells to exert its therapeutic effect. vivo morpholino (vPMO) is a modified morpholino called vivo morpholino. vPMOs have been tested in the mdx52 mouse and dystrophic dog models. an effective way to enhance PMO penetration in cell membrane is to conjugate them to short cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) conjugation of PMOs to a penetratin which contains six arginines residues near the N-terminus (R6-Penetratin) and a bulky side-chain composed of hydrophobic amino acids generated a new class of PMOs called PMO internalization peptides (Pips) the corresponding CPP's serum stability and nuclear delivery but failed to prevent intracellular degradation. in vitro and animal studies undertaken in the field of DMD. list of developed PPMOs and their therapeutic effects in experimental models.

PPMO administration at a more advanced stage of disease failed to prevent disease progression although significantly delayed the disease progression when applied to mice in an early stage of disease. chimeric fusion peptide generated by conjugation of a muscle-specific heptapeptide and a B peptide can induce effective exon skipping resulting in an efficient restoration of dystrophin in multiple skeletal muscles. PPMOs over PMOs to induce efficient systemic and target specific exon skipping and ameliorate the DMD phenotype was evident from the pioneering studies in mdx mice [121,[159], [160], [161], [16 diaphragm targeting In the mdx mouse model, diaphragm exhibits a fibrotic pattern with loss of elasticity and increased collagen density. a single intraperitoneal injection of 25 mg/kg restored up to 25% of diaphragmatic dystrophin but this percentage dropped when a lower dosage of 5 mg/kg was administered systemically in the mdx mice. a single dose of 19 mg/kg of B-PMO administered intraperitoneally markedly restored diaphragmatic dystrophin. the same dose delivered intravenously also elevated dystrophin in intercostal and sternomastoid muscles of mdx mice [176]. mdx mice have shown little efficacy in upregulating dystrophin protein levels in myocardium. restoration of dystrophin in skeletal muscles and diaphragm in mdx mouse and in the more severely affected dystrophin/utrophin double knock out mouse restored cardiac function to wild type levels. however intravenous administration of 19 mg/kg dose of B-PMO delivered intravenously or intraperitoneally restored dystrophin level of respiratory muscles but failed to improve cardiac function in mdx mice. a dose of 6 mg/kg biweekly for a year rather than the higher treatment regime of 30 mg/kg monthly restores dystrophin in cardiac muscle up to 5%. a single intravenous injection of Pip5e-PMO -conjugated peptide induced 50% dystrophin expression in the heart of mdx adult mice. the dystrophin protein expression improved vacuole degeneration in Purkinje fibres. increased Q/R ratio in the treated dogs. improved internalization into cells can occur via interchangeable pathways. the same group attributed the diminished potency of Pip6-PMO in cardiac cells versus skeletal muscle cells to different endocytic pathway internalization routes. the same group attributed the diminished potency of Pip6-PMO in cardiac cells versus skeletal muscle cells to different endocytic pathways. injection of PPMOs in the tibialis anterior of the mdx mouse resulted in efficient exon 23 skipping and significantly higher dystrophin rescue compared to the naked PMOs.

PPMOs over PMOs to induce efficient systemic and target specific exon skipping and ameliorate the DMD phenotype. diaphragm targeting In the mdx mouse model, diaphragm exhibits a fibrotic pattern with loss of elasticity and increased collagen density. repetitive administration of an (R-X-R)4XB\u2013PMO conjugate effectively restored dystrophin expression in the diaphragm of mdx mice, when treatment was applied as early as the neonatal stage. a single dose of 19 mg/kg of B-PMO administered intraperitoneally markedly restored diaphragmatic dystrophin. the same dose delivered intravenously also elevated dystrophin in intercostal and sternomastoid muscles of mdx mice [176]. 5.6. no available treatment is capable of restoring dystrophin protein in the heart of mdx mice. arginine-rich PPMO with backbone of (RXRRBR)2XB- targeting exon 23 successfully restored dystrophin almost to normal levels. up to 20% of dystrophin expression was detected in the heart of mdx mice. a dose of 6 mg/kg biweekly for a year rather than the higher treatment regime of 30 mg/kg monthly restores dystrophin in cardiac muscle up to 5%. a single intravenous injection of Pip5e-PMO -conjugated peptide induced 50% dystrophin expression in the heart of mdx adult mice. the use of PMO and PPMO in neurodegenerative diseases. the term neurodegenerative diseases encompass a range of progressive disorders characterized by the gradual degeneration of the structure and function of the nervous system [186]. a range of progressive disorders characterized by the gradual degeneration of the structure and function of the nervous system [186] PPMOs can effectively cross the BBB and reach targets in the CNS if administered via intrathecal injection. arginine rich CPP-conjugated PMO was efficiently delivered to cerebellum and Purkinje cells. oligonucleotide analog resulted in dystrophin restoration in the brain of mdx mice. phenotypic variations can be attributed to the number of copies of SMN1\u2019s centromeric homolog, called survival motor neuron gene 2 (SMN2) [199] most SMN2 transcripts lack exon 7 and interfere with SMN\u2019s ability to oligomerize. SMN2 may only partially compensate for the lack of SMN PPMO trials have been conducted to improve systemic delivery and minimize side effects that result from repeated intravenous injections. a derivative of an ApoE (141-150) peptide was capable of successfully inducing pre-mRNA exon 7 inclusion of SMN2 in a mouse model of spinal muscular atrophy. the main scope is to reduce aberrant mRNA transcripts in all other neurodegenerative PPMO trials. a 2-MOE ASO (ISIS 333611) decreased SOD1 mRNA in spinal cord of recruited ALS patients in a phase 1 randomized control trial. a 2-MOE ASO (ISIS 333611) decreased SOD1 mRNA in spinal cord of recruited ALS patients in a phase 1 randomized control trial. exon skipping may aid restoration of partially functional dystrophin in most human tissues. toxicity may arise due to immunogenic mechanisms such as complement activation [167,225] and first-generation arginine-rich peptides were found to be more immunogenic than PMOs [164]. a pre-clinical trial using an arginine rich PPMO conducted by Sarepta had to be terminated due to the toxic side effects. novel biomarkers of acute kidney injury such as Kim1 and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalinare (N-GAL) are highly specific, sensitive and inexpensive and greatly facilitated monitoring the efficacy of experimental treatments in animal models. the timing of exon skipping treatment is equally important to the dosage regime. destabilization of the interactions of satellite cells with the surrounding environment leads to a exacerbation of inflammation and fibrosis, further complicating DMD pathogenesis. PPMO treatment is not effective in advanced disease patients where a prolonged absence of dystrophin has led to advanced fibro-fatty degeneration. this vicious cycle can only be broken if combination of existing therapies with PPMO skipping are applied. a major drawback in order to optimize delivery in tissues is the lack of prediction of PPMO efficiency from their secondary structure. current therapy can target only one exon and thus is applicable to a limited number of individuals harbouring the specific mutation in other exons. if a multi-exon skipping treatment regime is approved, this treatment may be applicable to almost half of the DMD community. a rather conservative approach is required when reviewing and validating drug efficacy data that are solidly based on dystrophin quantification. a clear, dose-response effect on the amount of dystrophin protein quantified from muscle biopsies has not been established yet. a more objective post-therapeutic evaluation of muscle function recovery is pending. the widespread used mdx murine model exhibits the pathological characteristics of disease but has a mild phenotype and normal life span. it is a priority to establish more appropriate pre-clinical models of disease. human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS) have been programmed to produce skeletal muscle constructs expressing the characteristic markers of maturation. biochemical endpoints are correlated with the ability of gene therapy treatments to restore dystrophin and reduce fibrosis. biochemical endpoints are correlated with the ability of gene therapy treatments to restore dystrophin and reduce fibrosis. improvement of existing clinical endpoints can be achieved by the use of novel technology."}
