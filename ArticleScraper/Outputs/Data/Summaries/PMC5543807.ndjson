{"summary": "the list of pathogens that infect bats includes major mammalian paramyxoviruses [2], coronaviruses [3], [4], filoviruses [5], [6], [7], distinct influenza lineages [8], [9], hepadnaviruses [10], and hantaviruses [13], as well as lyssaviruses such as rabies virus [13]. rabies transmitted by vampire bats the rabies G glycoprotein into vaccinia virus has been used for many years to curtail rabies outbreaks in foxes, raccoons and other animals in North America and Europe [21] this vector has undesirable side-effects, especially in immunocompromised individuals [25], necessitating the development of attenuated virus strains. the infectivity and pathogenicity of MVA and RCN in T. brasiliensis was assessed via in vivo imaging studies. the immunogenicity of RCN given oronasally was also assessed using standard serologic techniques after vaccination with an RCN-G. recombinant viruses were generated and amplified on cell monolayers of rat embryonic fibroblasts (Rat-2, ATCC #CRL-1764), baby hamster kidney cells (BHK-21, ATCC #CRL-12072), African Green monkey kidney epithelial cells (Vero, ATCC #CCL-18), or primary chicken embryo fibroblasts. the recombinant viruses were detected by the presence of the RFP gene during homologous recombination. after 48\u201372 h, the cell cultures were put through three freeze\u2013thaw cycles, harvested, sonicated, and centrifuged at 4 \u00b0C. intramuscular (IM) injection split into two 50 l volumes injected into each thigh muscle. remaining four bats were given the same amount of virus in 70 l sterile saline. animals were monitored for 3 h post inoculation for signs of adverse effects. images were collected and analyzed using Living Image software (Caliper Life Sciences, alameda, California, USA) a region of interest (ROI) was created which covered the entire body of the bat when analyzing the luminescence data. at 87 dpi, a random group of six bats, all initially exposed to RCN-luc by either the ON (n = 4) or IM (n = 2) route, was given a booster exposure to the RCN-luc vaccine via the the limit of detection for this PCR protocol was determined to be 0.125 picograms of DNA, or 6.8x104 copies, as determined by serial dilution of a known quantity of viral DNA. any samples positive by PCR were then assessed for levels of live virus by determining the median tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) serum samples from bats given RCN-luc were also collected at 0 and 60 dpi. a micropipette was used to collect the serum from the top of the blood container. adult male bats (T. brasiliensis; n = 22) were caught in Brazos County, Texas under Texas Parks and Wildlife Department permit number SPR-1104-610 and Texas A&M University ACUC approval number 2012-130. Upon transfer to NWHC, bats were maintained in flight cages for a quarantine period of 30 days. cell cultures were maintained at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) or Opti-MEM\u00ae (Life technologies, Madison, WI 53719), supplemented with 2\u20135% fetal bovine serum (FBS). recombinant MVA-luc viruses were constructed as described elsewhere. recombinant virus was confirmed by PCR analysis using oneTaq\u00ae Quick-Load\u00ae 2X Master Mix with standard Buffer. the virus amplified at the Del III flanks using ATGCGGCACCTCTCTTAA as a forward primer and CCAAAGCTTGCACATACATA as the reverse primer. animals were scanned using an IVIS 200 Biophotonic imager at one-day post infection (dpi) and every-other day thereafter until 2 consecutive images with less than 100 radiance units (comparable to background) were observed. images were collected and analyzed using Living Image software (Caliper Life Sciences, Alameda, California, USA) oral swabs were collected and placed in a 1.5 ml tube containing 200 l DMEM media. all samples were quickly stored at -80 \u00b0C until testing. DNA was extracted from 40 l of the samples using the Zymo Quick-gDNATM MiniPrep kit. serial dilutions from 102 to 107 were made, and 100 l from each was used to infect a 96 well plate with BHK-21 cells at 80% confluency. after 3 days of infection, 100 l of the steadylite reagent was added to each well. after 15 min the plates were scanned in a luminometer. femoral vein and collecting up to 200 l of blood in a capillary tube. a micropipette was used to collect the serum from the top of the blood container. the assay was run in triplicate for each sample. peak levels were observed at 1 and 3 dpi for the IM and ON routes. luminescence was significantly higher (P = 0.028) in bats that received raccoon poxvirus (RCN) and significantly higher (P = 0.032) for those administered virus by the IM route compared to the ON route. on poxvirus (RCN) than modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) no significant difference (P = 0.33) was detected in luminescence when compared to initial exposure through 5 days post infection. no significant difference (P = 0.33) was detected in luminescence when compared to initial exposure through 5 days post infection. rabies virus G is very well characterized and known to induce protective humoral immunity to rabies virus [30], [45], [46] all bats assessed by RFFIT had negligible Ab titers prior to vaccination. by 30 dpi all bats (5/5) developed Ab titers greater than 0.2 IU/ml. all bats infected with luc-expressing poxvirus vectors had detectable expression of luminescence by 1 dpi. peak levels were observed at 1 and 3 dpi for the IM and ON routes. viral infection via IM exposure was cleared within 7 days for MVA and 9 days for RCN. infection after ON exposure was cleared within 9 days for MVA. luciferase-expressing constructs were given in photons/second/cm2/steridian (p/s/cm2/sr) no significant difference (P = 0.33) was detected in luminescence when compared to initial exposure through 5 days post infection. oral swabs also had PCR positive fecal samples at 7 and 9 dpi. no live virus was recovered from these samples in titration. rabies virus G is very well characterized and known to induce protective humoral immunity to rabies virus. efforts are focused on culling of populations (e.g. vampire bats in Latin America) or controlling disease after spill-over into other animal hosts. the continued spillover of rabies virus strains to humans and domestic animals has led to the development of successful oral rabies vaccination programs in Europe and North America. these campaigns often utilize recombinant viral vectors that stimulate immunity to the surface glycoprotein of rabies when ingested orally. an average anti-rabies G titer of 5.14 IU at 60 dpi was detected in bats orally administered RCN-G. this is higher than the levels obtained after vaccination with the VR-G construct in any previous studies. previous studies failed to address the infectivity of vaccinia in the bat host. the results of our experiments provide proof-of-principle that oral vaccination is possible in free-ranging bats. topical vehicles will be developed that could be used to deliver oral vaccines to the fur coat of bats as they roost or are otherwise congregated. development of topical poxvirus vectored vaccines could lead to effective, applicable, and practical means for reducing disease burden in some free ranging bat populations."}
