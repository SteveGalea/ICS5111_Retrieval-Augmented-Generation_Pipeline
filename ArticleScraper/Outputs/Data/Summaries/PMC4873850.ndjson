{"summary": "antisera against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), swine group A rotavirus (pGARV), classical swine fever virus (CSFV), porcine circovirus-2 (PCV-2), porcine pseudorabies virus (PRRSV) monoclonal antibodies against histidine (His) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) tags were obtained. rPDCoV-N proteins were purified according to the method described by Zhu et al. [24]. the recombinant proteins of PDCoV were named rPDCoV-N. they were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE. RT-PCR was used to detect PDCoV in pig farms in Heilongjiang province. rectal swab samples were collected from sows and piglets in diarrhea-affected and non-affected pig farms from September 2014 to December 2014. the peroxidase-mediated luminescence was digitally captured using the Molecular Imager ChemiDoc XRS+ System (Bio-Rad) and Image Lab software (Bio-Rad) 56 serum samples were collected from piglets before eating colostra in a PDCoV-negative and diarrhea-unaffected pig farm. the best reaction conditions for the rPDCoV-N-ELISA were as follows. the 56 PDCoV-negative serum samples were tested using the rPDCoV-N-ELISA. the reaction conditions were the same as those described for the rPDCoV-N-ELISA procedures. each sample was tested three times, and the mean PR value was used for analysis. 62 serum samples were randomly selected from six pig farms in Heilongjiang province. 30 serum samples were collected from three diarrhea-free pig farms. 62 serum samples were subjected to western blotting using rPDCoV-N. expression of the synthesized N gene of PDCoV (rPDCoV-N) was performed in the vectors pET-32a (with a His-tag) and pGEX-6p-1 with a GST-tag (64 kDa) rPDCoV-N protein was verified using anti-His-tag and anti-GST mAbs. screening of rPDCoV-positive and PDCoV-negative sera was conducted by western blotting using the rPDCoV-N protein with a His-tag and GST-tag as an antigen. the results revealed that one serum sample, named pZD-166, exhibited a specific reaction with His-tagged and GST-tagged rPDCoV-N proteins. the pZD-166 serum sample was used as a positive control when establishing the rPD rPDCoV-N-ELISA tested antisera against PEDV, TGEV, pGARV, pGARV, CSFV, PCV-2, PRV and PRRSV. sensitivity and specificity of the rPDCoV-N-ELISA were 100% and 90.4%, respectively. a total of 319 serum samples from 15 pig farms were tested by the rPDCoV-N-ELISA. the results indicated that 11.59% of samples (37/319) were positive for antibodies against PDCoV. for the farms without diarrhea, 3.33% of samples (7/210) were positive for antibodies against PDCoV. anti-PDCoV IgG ELISA results are in line with those of an indirect anti-PDCoV IgG ELISA based on the putative S1 portion of the S protein. the N protein exhibited a high degree of conservation, 98.8\u2013100% identities, among different PDCoV strains. a novel ELISA diagnostic method requires validation via a comparison with the same, or similar, commercial ELISA kit. no ELISA kit was available for evaluation of the rPDCoV-N-ELISA. the rPDCoV-N-ELISA exhibited a relative specificity of 90.4% and a relative sensitivity of 100%. results will need to be confirmed through more extensive serological investigation of PDCoV epidemiology."}
