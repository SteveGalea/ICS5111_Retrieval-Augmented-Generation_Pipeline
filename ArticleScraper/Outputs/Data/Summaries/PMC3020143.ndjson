{"summary": "in the induction and maintenance of memory CD8+ memory T cells, different roles of CD4+ T cells have been described [6]\u2013[9]. however, in the so-called \u2018classical model\u2019, CD4+ T cells contribute to memory CD8+ T-cell generation indirectly via APCs. extracellular antigens are presented via MHC class II molecules to CD4+ T cells. intracellular antigens are presented via MHC class I molecules to CD8+ T cells. to induce antigen-specific CTL, antigens must be loaded onto the class I MHC processing pathway in APCs via cross-presentation. this study was aimed at evaluating the role of CD4+ T cells in induction of long-lived memory CD8+ T cells by liposome-coupled peptides. a significant induction of CTL specific for OVA257-264 was observed on day 4 and a complete cell killing was observed as early as 5 days after the immunization. 257-264-liposome as low as 0.6 g/mouse (4 dilution) induced a perfect killing as assayed by in vivo CTL assay. OVA257-264 solution induced only a partial killing even at the highest dose. mice were immunized with 50 l of OVA257-264-liposome and 2, 4, 8, 16, and 20 weeks later, the mice received a booster injection with OVA. three days after the booster injection, in vivo CTL assay was performed. a complete cell killing was observed at 2 weeks after the immunization without a booster injection. data represents mean 3H- thymidine incorporation and SE of triplicate cultures. in vivo elimination with CD4+ T cells affected neither for primary (Figure 5A) nor secondary (Figure 5B) CTL responses. antigen-specific primary CD8+ T cells and CTLs in mice by OVA257-264-liposome conjugates. a significant induction of CTL specific for OVA257-264 was observed on day 4 and a complete cell killing was observed as early as 5 days after the immunization. mice were immunized with 50 l of OVA257-264-liposome in the presence of 5 g CpG. one to 5 days later, an in vivo CTL assay was performed. data represent means and SE of three mice per group. a complete cell killing was observed at 2 weeks after the immunization without a booster injection. a significant recall response was observed even at 20 weeks when the primary CTL response was nearly undetectable. an antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell proliferation assay further confirmed the results. mice were inoculated with GK1.5 and immunized with OVA257-264-liposome. in vivo elimination with CD4+ T cells affected neither for primary or secondary CTL responses. a significant recall response, comparable to that in normal mice, was observed in mice from which CD4+ T cells had been eliminated. osome, CD4+ T cells were not required in either primary or secondary response. immunization of mice with OVA-liposome conjugates induced IgE-selective unresponsiveness without apparent Th1 polarization. this finding was further confirmed in CD4+ cell-depleted mice. surface-linked liposomal antigens could be used to develop vaccines with minimal induction of IgE synthesis. a significant difference was observed between liposomes with different lipid components. this difference could affect their ability to induce cross-presentation. the results of the present study differed from those reported previously [1]-[5]. differences may be due to differences in how mice were primed with antigens. in most of the studies reported previously, mice were primed by infecting viruses. the use of the immunodominant CTL epitope would be more effective than the use of an attenuated, inactivated, or subunit vaccine in the development of virus vaccines to elicit effective antiviral CD8+ T cell responses. cytotoxic T cells specific for the internal proteins NP and M1 show high cross-reactivity between strains and subtypes, reflecting high conservation of the internal proteins. human HLA class I-restricted, immunodominant CTL epitopes derived from internal proteins of H5N1 influenza viruses. most of the CTL epitopes determined were well conserved and were identical with those involved in H1N1 and H3N2 influenza viruses. surface-linked liposomal antigens may be applicable for the development of a CTL-based influenza vaccine capable of inducing protection against heterosubtypic influenza viruses. HC class-I (Kb)-binding peptides OVA257-264 (SIINFEKL) were obtained from Operon Biotechnologies (Tokyo, Japan) they consisted of dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine (DOPC), dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine (DOPE), dioleoyl phosphatidyl ethanolamine (DOPG) and cholesterol. l of saturated NaCl aqueous solution were added to the solution, shaken for 1 min, and allowed to separate. the upper layer washed with the same buffer and 3 ml of acetone was added to dissolve the residue. the solvent was removed under reduced pressure and 5.8 ml of phosphate buffer was added to make a 4.8% lipid suspension. in vivo elimination of CD4+ T cells, mice were immunized intraperitoneally (ip) with 200 l of 1-mg/ml OVA in PBS solution. this treatment resulted in a >99% decrease in the number of CD4+ T cells in the spleen and lymph nodes as determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter. cells were obtained from spleen cells of CBF1 mice using the magnetic cell sorter system MACS. CD8+ T cells and DCs were suspended in RPMI-1640 containing 10% FCS at cell densities of 2106/ml and 8105/ml respectively. all mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions. phospholipids were obtained from NOF Co. (Tokyo, Japan) antigens and Reagents Ovalbumin (OVA, grade VII) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. a mixture of 10 ml of anhydrous chloroform solution containing 0.136 mM DOPE and 24 l of TEA was added in drops to 26.6 ml of anhydrous chloroform solution containing 0.681 mM DSS. the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure, and 18 ml of a 21 mixture of ethyl acetate and tetrahydrofuran was added to the solution. the liposome-coupled- and uncoupled peptides were separated. the resulting solution contained 47 g/ml of peptides. the mice were immunized with indicated doses of OVA257-264-liposome conjugates via subctaneous injection. a total of 1106 cells were injected i.v. into the indicated group of mice. spleen cells were harvested from each mouse and analyzed by using FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA) immunized mice and whole spleen cells (1105 cells/well) of 25 Gy-irradiated nave mice were cultured in 96-well plates for 4 days. cells were pulsed with 1.25 Ci (0.046 MBq) [3H]-thymidine (PerkinElmer) for the final 6 hours."}
