{"summary": "EV71 infection recurs every 2 or 3 years in Asia-Pacific region. redox environment is a factor affecting host-microbe interactions. increased oxidative stress in host cells enhances EV71 infection. the mechanism for ROS production in EV71-infected cells remains elusive. mitochondria-associated adaptors such as MAVS are involved in modulation of innate immunity [22]. EV71 infection induces mitochondrial dysfunction and anomalous changes in their morphology and subcellular distribution. these changes are associated with altered cellular energy metabolism. increased mitochondrial mass may compensate for energy deficit caused by abnormal mitochondria. the infected cells were stained with 100 nM MitoTracker Red and 5 M H2DCFDA for 20 min at 37\u00b0C. they were counterstained with with 5 g/ml of Hoechst 33342. infected cells were loaded with 0.5 M of JC-1 in culture medium at 37\u00b0C for 60 min. they were counterstained with 5 g/ml of Hoechst 33342 prior to examination. to scan for signal of JC-1 monomeric form, we used the 488 nm excitation line of argon laser. cells were stained with 100 nM Mitotracker Red 580FM (Invitrogen, CA, USA) and analyzed according to manufacturer\u2019s instruction. cell monolayer was washed three times with PBS, and trypsinized. cells were infected with EV71 at m.o.i. of 1.25, washed twice with PBS, and scrapped in ice-cold SHE buffer. the homogenate was centrifuged at 1000g at 4\u00b0C for 10 min, then centrifuged at 10000g at 4\u00b0C for 10 min. the pellet was fixed with fresh 2.5% glutaraldehyde/PBS at 4\u00b0C for 2 hr. after fixation, it was rinsed with PBS thrice for 10 min each. it was then stained en bloc with 0.5% uranyl acetate/50% ethanol. SF268 glioblastoma cells were cultured in modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mM glutamine, 2 mM non-essential amino acids, 100 U/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin and 0.25 g/ml amphotericin at 37\u00b0C. EV71 (BrCr strain; ATCC VR784) was propagated in Vero cells. the specimens were examined using Plan-Apochromat 1001.40 NA oil immersion objective. to scan for DCF signal, we used the 488 nm excitation line of argon laser, beam splitter and an emission window set at 505\u2013550 nm. to scan for signal of JC-1 aggregated form, we used the 488 nm excitation line of argon laser, triple-dichroic beam splitter and an emission window set at 500\u2013540 nm. to scan for signal of JC-1 aggregated form, we used the 488 nm excitation line of argon laser, triple-dichroic beam splitter and an emission window set at 500\u2013540 nm. infected cells were loaded with 0.5 M JC-1 monomer fluorescence (FL1 channel) and J-aggregate fluorescence (FL2 channel) with CELLQuest software. the cell monolayer was washed three times with PBS, and trypsinized. the cells were washed three times with PBS; triedpsinized; placed in a BEEM capsule; and centrifuged to form a pellet with a size of 0.5\u20131 mm3. the pellet was fixed with fresh 2.5% glutaraldehyde/PBS at 4\u00b0C for 2 hr. one ml of 1% OsO4 was added to the cell pellet for 1 hr. the pellet was washed with PBS thrice for 10 min each. it was then stained en bloc with 0.5% uranyl acetate/50% ethanol. EV71 infected-SF268 cells were stained at 54 hr post-infection (p.i.) with Mitotracker Red and H2DCFDA. the infected cells showed 3-fold increase in mitochondrial ROS generation. at infection time greater than 60 hr, infected cells exhibited a great loss of viability. EV71 infection causes mitochondrial ROS production. SF268 cells were mock- (A) or infected with (B) EV71 at 1.25 for 54 hr. the results are presented as meanSD of three separate experiments. treatment of cells with apocyanin, a NADPH oxidase inhibitor, did not affect EV71-induced ROS generation in infected SF268 cells. the findings suggest that NOX is not involved in ROS generation in infected cells. the crista arrangement in mitochondria of the infected cells became largely distorted. the outer membrane was no longer closely apposed to the inner membrane, and the intermembrane space was enlarged. EV71 infection results in morphological changes in mitochondria. dria are heterogeneous in morphology, ranging from round, ovoid structure to long, interconnected structure. most mitochondria were elongated tubular or oblong structure. most mitochondria showed green fluorescence, and were depolarized or de-energized. the ratio of MRI of FL2 channel to that of FL1 channel (FL2/FL1) was calculated. results are mean SD, n = 3. *p0.05 vs. uninfected cells. EV71-induced ROS generation and reduction in m are associated with defective electron transport. EV71 infection-induced oxygen consumption is associated with a reduction in respiratory efficiency. SF268 cells were mock- or infected with EV71 at 1.25 for indicated times. EV71 infection causes an increase in mitochondrial mass and alteration in protein expression. mitochondrial mass of EV71-infected cells at 48 hr p.i. was about 50% higher than that of control. EV71 infection induces mitochondrial proliferation and changes in expression of mitochondrial proteins. SF268 cells were mock- or infected (+) with EV71 at an m.o.i. of 1.25 for 48 hr. SF268 cells were mock- (Con) or infected (Infected) with EV71. they were harvested for UPLC-based analyses of ATP, ADP and AMP. these adenine nucleotides are normalized to cellular protein content. the level of eIF2 phosphorylation increased significantly in infected cells. treatment with mito-TEMPO reduced both basal and EV71-induced eIF2 phosphorylation. it was associated with significant reduction in expression of viral 3D protein and viral replication. EV71 induces mitochondrial ROS generation Infection of neural SF268 cells with EV71 induces oxidative stress in time-dependent manner. the levels of ROS in cells infected at multiplicity of infection were 3- and 6-fold that of uninfected control at 48 and 72 hr respectively. EV71 infection causes mitochondrial ROS production. SF268 cells were mock- (A) or infected with (B) EV71 at an m.o.i. of 1.25 for 54 hr. were subject to H2DCFDA staining and flow cytometric analysis. the results are presented as meanSD, n = 3. *p0.05 vs. uninfected cells. the mitochondrial production of ROS is validated by pharmacological approach. treatment of EV71-infected cells with complex I inhibitor rotenone significantly inhibited ROS generation. replication sites of EV71 developed from rough endoplasmic reticulum. the virus-induced membrane vesicles were absent from the uninfected cells. a significant percentage of atypical mitochondria were observed. EV71 causes decline in mitochondrial electrochemical potential m. mitochondria are heterogeneous in morphology, ranging from round, ovoid structure to long, interconnected structure. a functional parameter of mitochondria is electrochemical potential m. SF268 cells were mock- or infected with EV71 at an m.o.i. of 1.25 for indicated times. the ratio of MRI of FL2 channel to that of FL1 channel (FL2/FL1) was calculated, and is expressed relative to that of uninfected cells. oligomycin-sensitive oxygen consumption rate of infected cells was 42% lower than that of control cells. EV71 infection-induced oxygen consumption is associated with a reduction in respiratory efficiency. SF268 cells were mock- or infected with EV71 at 1.25 for indicated times. results are mean SD, n = 6. *p0.05 vs. uninfected cells. EV71 infection causes an increase in mitochondrial mass and alteration in protein expression. mitochondrial proteins include NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) 1 subcomplex 8 (NDUFB8), ubiquinol-cytochrome C reductase core protein I (UQCRC1), and cytochrome c oxidase II (COX-II) were elevated. other proteins, for example succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit B iron sulfur protein (SDHB) and cytochrome C (CYC), remained unchanged mitochondrial dysfunction affects ATP supply. we measured levels of ATP, ADP and AMP in control and infected cells. EV71 infection results in lower energy status of infected cells. mito-TEMPO completely suppressed mitochondrial ROS production in infected cells. this concentration was used in subsequent experiments. it is known that phosphorylation of eIF2 signifies the initiation of viral protein synthesis during enteroviral infection. cells were mock- () or infected (+) with EV71 at an m.o.i. of 1.25. cells were treated without or with 200 M of Mito-TEMPO. forty-eight hours later, cells were analyzed for levels of EV71 genomic RNA. the mechanism for EV71-induced ROS production is currently enigmatic. a number of viral proteins interact with mitochondria or their proteins. hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) interacts with mitochondrial heat shock protein 60 and 70, and VDAC3 [29], [49], and promotes oxidative stress. cristae shape affects the interaction between respiratory complexes and the respiratory efficiency. a drop in m causes a deficit in oxidative phosphorylation. re-distribution of mitochondria in infected cells serves the purpose. glycolytic pathway may be enhanced in EV71-infected cells. mitochondria are involved in biosynthesis of biomolecules as lipids. mitochondria are involved in biosynthesis of such biomolecules as lipids. mitochondrial mass in EV71-infected cells is accompanied by differential increases in mitochondrial proteins. increase in level of COX-II is consistent with increase in its transcription. it is speculative whether such differential changes in protein expression contribute to mitochondrial respiratory functions. membranous structures in picornavirus-infected cells represent the site of replication. synthesis of picornaviral protein can activate ER stress response. EV71 induces ER stress response and causes eIF2 phosphorylation."}
