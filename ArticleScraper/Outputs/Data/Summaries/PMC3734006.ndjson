{"summary": "Background Transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) is an enteropathogenic coronavirus that causes diarrhea in pigs. it is correlated with high morbidity and mortality in suckling piglets. information remains limited about the comparative protein expression of host cells in response to TGEV infection. the genome of TGEV encodes four structural proteins: spike (S), membrane (M,), minor envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. the surface protein S, a large type I transmembrane glycoprotein that forms peplomers, is responsible for cell receptor binding and membrane fusion. the small E protein, a transmembrane protein detected as a minor structural component, is essential for TGEV replication. proteomics method analyzing host cellular responses to TGEV infection can be used to identify important cellular factors involved in viral pathogenesis. a total of 33 differentially expressed protein spots were identified, and those proteins of interest were confirmed by Western blot. a high percentage of TGEV-infected ST cells showed considerable cell death. the cytophatic effect caused by the TGEV virus was analyzed by optical microscopy, at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h p.i. image of imageQuant and DeCyder analysis of 35 differentially expressed protein spots in 2D DIGE gels. T + and T- represent TGEV-infected and mock-infected ST cells. a total of 33 protein spots with a threshold greater than 2-fold were excised manually. proteins 1154 beta actin (ACTB) gi|45269029 44.76 5.55 3 36 285 3.64 0.000035 1308 beta actin (ACTB) gi|45269029 44.76 5.55 3 16 407 4.04 0.00013 1312 beta actin (ACTB) gi|45269029 44.76 5.55 3 14 129 2.82 0.00076 1368 beta actin (ACTB) gi|45269029 44 vimentin (VIM) gi|335296459 53.64 5.05 4 35 582 4.84 0.000014 1968 vimentin (VIM) gi|21431723 30.97 4.67 4 25 366 3.06 0.00036 1970 vimentin (VIM) gi|335296459 53.64 5.06 4 35 603 2.43 0.00082 1907 keratin 19 (KRT19) gi|311267276 44 gi|154147660 46.13 5.32 5 40 531 3.37 0.0011 1509 acidic ribosomal protein P0 (RPLP0) gi|182705234 34.34 5.71 4 50 483 2.38 0.02 Vesicle transport 1602 annexin A8 (ANXA8) gi|194042330 36.71 5.20 6 63 752 3.31 0.0063 1814 annexin A4 (ANXA4) 17 proteins, including cytoskeleton-associated proteins (35.3%), protein biosynthesis and modification proteins (17.6%), vesicle transport proteins (11.8%), mitochondria-associated proteins (5.9%), signal transduction-associated proteins (5.9%), and 5.9% metabolism-associated proteins. some different spots were identified to be products of the same gene. transcript alteration of the differentially expressed proteins in TGEV-infected ST cells. total cellular RNA of ST cells with or without TGEV infection at 48 h p.i. was measured by real time RT-PCR analysis. the average densitometric intensity of keratin19, alpha tubulin, vimentin, and prohibitin in immunoblot analysis. the averaged densitometric intensity of keratin19, alpha tubulin, vimentin, and prohibitin in immunoblot analysis, with GAPDH as a loading control (C) the mAb to N protein in TGEV-infected and mock-infected ST cells was checked using the method of Western blot (B) T + and T- represent the TGEV infected and uninfected ST cells. a total of 33 protein spots with a threshold greater than 2-fold were excised manually from gels. they were subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion and subsequent MALDI-TOF/TOF identification. a total of 33 differentially expressed protein spots were successfully identified. gi|45269029 44.76 5.55 1 16 82 4.68 0.0097 1383 beta actin (ACTB) gi|45269029 44.76 5.55 5 34 537 3.7 0.0019 1647 beta actin (ACTB) gi|150438831 44.76 5.55 3 21 242 7.03 0.005 1675 alpha tropomyosin (TPM1) gi|158931149 32.69 4.71 5 46 keratin 19 (KRT19) gi|311267276 44.19 5.05 8 47 682 3.99 0.000023 2090 vimentin (VIM) gi|21431723 30.97 4.67 2 9 120 5.63 0.0095 2280 vimentin (VIM) gi|335296459 53.64 5.06 6 34 504 9.65 0.0031 RNA processing 1606 heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U gi|4033507 35.81 5.71 5 49 510 5.96 0.000008 Mitochondrion associated protein 906 cytochrome b-c1 complex subunit 1 (UQCRC1) gi|335299041 52.67 5.76 4 38 342 7.9 0.000023 1094 prohibitin (PHB) gi|335308255 28.88 5.74 6 72 688 3.04 0.0031 Signal transduction 1871 14-3-3 protein cleus (11.8%), mitochondrion (11.8%), beta actin, alpha tubulin, vimentin, eukaryotic initiation factor 4A-I and thiopurine S-methyltransferase. 7 protein spots (6 up-regulated spots and 1 down-regulated spots) were identified as beta actin. 8 protein spots (5 up-regulated spots and 3 down-regulated spots) were identified as vimentin. three proteins, alpha tubulin, keratin 19 and prohibitin were selected for western blot analysis. keratin 19 was down-regulated and alpha tubulin and prohibitin were up-regulated. keratin19, alpha tubulin, vimentin, and prohibitin were recognized with respective antibodies. no results have been reported for performing analysis of differential proteome of host cells infected with TGEV. in this study, 2D DIGE coupled with MALDI-TOF/TOF was used to analyze the differential proteome of ST cells infected with TGEV. proteins beta actin and microtubule-associated alpha tubulin and beta tubulin were identified, which was believed to facilitate the transport of viral proteins of TGEV from rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the reservoir for viral replication. this protein serves to maintain cell shape and is involved in attachment, migration and cell signaling [28] the levels of HIV-1 viral transcripts are dramatically down-regulated in cytoplasm of infected cells by HNRNPU. another RNA processing protein, thiopurine S-methyltransferase, was found to be more abundant in TGEV-infected cells. TPMT plays a role in BVDV virus replication and thiopurines inhibit bovine viral diarrhea virus production. the up-regulated 60S RPLP0 was also found after TGEV infection. in this study, the up-regulated eukaryotic initiation factor 4A-I (EIF4A1) was identified after TGEV infection. PP2A enzymes have been clearly involved in regulation of cell transcription, cell cycle and viral transformation. the up-regulation of PP2A was found in TGEV infected ST cells. this suggests PP2A plays an important role in the dephosphorylation of cellular and viral protein during TGEV infection. a total of 17 altered cellular proteins that differentially expressed in TGEV infection were identified. the cells were infected with attenuated H (H167) at a multiplication of infection (MOI) of 1, and the cells were centrifuged at 10,000 g for 5 min. the cells were lysed with lysis buffer (7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% [w/v] CHAPS, 65 mM DTT, 0.2% pharmalyte 4/7 and 1 mM PMSF) IEF was performed using 30 V, 12 h; 200 V, 1 h; 1,000 V, 1 h; 8,000 V, 2 h; and 8,000 V, 65,000 vh. the isoelectric-focused proteins in strips were incubated for 15 min in the equilibration buffer containing 1% DTT. the second dimension separation was performed using the Ettan Dalt II system. determination of protein abundance and statistical analysis was performed using the in-gel standard from each image pair. matching between gels was performed using the Biological Variation Analysis (BVA) mode. only protein spots showing significance (p 0.05) were considered as up-regulated (ratio > 2) or down-regulated (ratio 2). MS analysis of peptides was performed on an AB SCIEX 5800 MALDI-TOF/TOF. the UV laser was operated at a 400 Hz repetition rate with wavelength of 355 nm. mass resolution was maximized at 1,600 Da. the membranes were incubated with mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) to alpha tubulin (1:1000, Abcam), mAb to prohibitin (1:500, II-14-10, Santa Cruz) and rabbit polyclonal antibody to keratin19 (1:500, Bioss) at 37\u00b0C for 60 min. cDNA synthesis was performed with 1 g of total cellular RNA using a cDNA synthesis kit (Fermentas) amplification was performed for 40 cycles, each consisting of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 5 s and primer annealing at 55\u00b0C for 15 s. parallel mock-infected ST cells were used as control (relative expression = 1). the proteins of TGEV infected ST cells were extracted according to the methods previously described. the cells were infected with attenuated H (H167) at a multiplication of infection (MOI) of 1, and the cells were scraped using a cell scraper at 48 h postinfection (p.i.), and centrifuged at 10,000 g for 5 min. IEF was performed using an IPGphor system (GE Healthcare) and commercially available 24-cm long IPG strips (Linear, pH 4\u20137, GE Healthcare) the settings and conditions for active rehydration were used as previously described. all gels were scanned with a resolution of 100 m and a standard pixel volume of 60,000-80,000 for all scans. inter-gel matching performed using the in-gel standard from each image pair. only protein spots showing significance (p 0.05) and at least a 2-fold difference in abundance were considered as up-regulated (ratio > 2) or down-regulated (ratio 2). l matrix solution (5 mg/ml -cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid diluted in 0.1%TFA, 50%ACN) was pipetted to dissolve it. then the mixture was spotted on a MALDI target plate. accelerated voltage was operated at 20 kV and mass resolution was maximized. cDNA synthesis was performed with 1 g of total cellular RNA using a RevertAidTM first strand cDNA synthesis kit. cDNA synthesis was performed with 1 g of total cellular RNA using a RevertAidTM first strand cDNA synthesis kit. a total volume of 20 L containing 10 ng of cDNA template, 1 SYBR\u00ae Premix Ex TaqTM II (Perfect Real Time, TaKaRa) and a 0.4 M concentration of each primer. each primer consisting of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 5 s and primer annealing at 55\u00b0C for 15 s. authors declare that they have no competing interests.
