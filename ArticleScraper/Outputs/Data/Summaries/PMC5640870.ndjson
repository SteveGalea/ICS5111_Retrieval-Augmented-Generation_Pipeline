{"summary": "the green tree python, or southern green python, is an oviparous boid constrictor snake with natural habitats in several Indonesian islands, Florida, Papua new Guinea, and northern Australia (1). in recent years, large numbers of M. viridis green tree pythons have been exported from Indonesia to Europe and the United States (2). recently, fatal pneumonias have been reported in two other python species, ball pyth roniviruses and mesoniviruses are known to infect crustaceans and insects. arteriviruses have been associated with an acute respiratory syndrome and abortion in pigs (porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus [PRRSV]) or a lethal hemorrhagic disease in nonhuman primates (simian hemorrhagic fever virus [SHFV]) in 2014, a Swiss breeder submitted two adult green tree pythons for diagnostic postmortem examination. both animals had died with signs of a mucinous pneumonia. a further five green tree pythons from three additional breeders exhibited similar pathological findings. histological examination revealed a variable degree of epithelial thickening in the trachea and lungs and a mild to moderate interstitial lymphoplasmacellular and heterophilic infiltration of the lung parenchyma. in one animal, a moderate multifocal granulomatous-necrotizing nephritis was additionally observed. the four control snakes (animals G2 to G6) did not exhibit similar gross and/or hist purulent vasculitis around esophagus and trachea G5 1 M Sudden death Focal suppurative pneumonia in one lobe a All animals were from breeding collections. MVNV-positive animals tested positive for MVNV by RT-PCR, RNA-ISH, and RNA-ISH. bronchus-type epithelium is dominated by ciliated cells (panels B1 and C1) in regions 2 (panels B2 and C2) and 3 (panels B3 and C3), the faveolae are covered by a single-layered gas exchange epithelium, comprised of flat type I pneumocytes. surfactant-producing type II pneumocytes (arrows) are less abundant. a further three animals, from the 2015 cohort, were then screened for a range of potentially pathogenic viruses. we prepared primary cultures of green tree python fetal liver and brain cells. after four passages, the cells began to proliferate more rapidly. TEM analysis showed rod- and kidney-shaped virions of 120 nm in length. virions consistent with torovirus particles. first evidence of a cytopathic effect is seen after 2 days (B) as enlargement, rounding, and cytoplasmic vacuolization. we obtained a single 21,000-nucleotide (nt) contig and several shorter contigs. the contig matched the previously identified sequences of ball python nidovirus (BPNV) and python nidovirus (PNV) RNA extracted from pure nidovirus preparation was subjected to another NGS run, which yielded almost a full-length genome in a single contig. we then performed a reference assembly using BPNV as the template to recover the missing genome ends (some 150 nt in total) for the novel virus, MVNV. a prediction for the RNA structure around the RFS in MVNV is shown. arrow highlights a difference from the structure described by Bodewes et al.

MVNV- or mock-infected cells were stained using anti-MVNV N protein antiserum at 3 dpi. the infected cells were stained using anti-MVNV N protein antiserum at a 1:2,000 dilution. the cytopathic effect on M. viridis brain cells was severe. the phylogenetic tree suggests that MVNV forms an outgroup to BPNV and PNV. the python nidoviruses clustered together with shingleback nidovirus (GenBank accession number KX184715) (37), Xinzhou nematode virus 6 (GenBank accession number KX883637), and bovine nidovirus (NCBI reference sequence accession number NC_027199 all diseased snakes had suffered from a chronic pneumonia with epithelial thickening in the trachea and lungs. the inflammatory component was represented by mild to moderate interstitial infiltration of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and/or heterophils. the mucus filling the faveolar space often contained heterophils and cell debris. representative photomicrographs of cross sections of the diseased lungs of animal B4 (A, C, E) and ultramicrographs of cross sections of the diseased lungs of animal A1 (B, D, and F) are shown. the PAS-alcian blue stain highlights positive secretory epithelial cells (arrowheads) in all cell layers of the hyperplastic multilayered trabecular epithelium. pneumocytes lining the faveolar space were found to be infected. intact and degenerated cells shed into the mucus were found to be infected. infected cells also varied in number between animals and in different areas of the lung in individual snakes. the pseudostratified trabelular epithelium (region 1) exhibits abundant viral RNA mainly in superficial epithelial cell layers. in the basal and middle layers, it is represented by a focal cytoplasmic reaction (arrowhead) the fully differentiated superficial epithelial cells exhibit abundant viral antigen (arrow) and a loss of cilia. the epithelial thickening was the most striking feature in the lungs of the nidovirus-positive snakes. the multilayered epithelium covering the trabeculae (region 1) displayed increased cellularity with an increase in cell layers and an irregular arrangement, indicating hyperplasia. the epithelium was significantly higher in the diseased animals than in the control snakes. hyperplasia was confirmed in both the lungs and the trachea. the average number of nuclei in the epithelial layer was significantly higher in the diseased snakes. the average epithelial height measured in three lung regions was significantly higher than that in noninfected (control) animals. box plots illustrate the third quartile (Q3) and first quartile (Q1) range of the data. the values were significantly different between infected and control animals. epithelial hyperplasia was associated with increased proliferative activity. a moderate number of epithelial cells were found to undergo apoptosis. s is also found to undergo apoptosis (arrow, C) in the control animal. only scattered individual basal epithelial cells are found to express PCNA (arrowhead, B) apoptosis is also seen in occasional lymphocytes (arrow) of the lymphoid aggregates. the observed type II pneumocyte hyperplasia is not specific to nidovirus infection in the python, since it has been described in snakes as a consequence of pneumocyte injury in a range of infectious diseases of viral, bacterial, and mycotic origin (39, 40). this suggests excess mucus production and release and reduced surfactant production and release and would explain the clinical findings. increased turnover and hyperplasia of the epithelium has been described for several coronaviral diseases. members of the subfamily Torovirinae are also known to induce epithelial cell apoptosis (35, 48, 49); however, further studies are required to elucidate whether this also applies to MVNV and other snake nidoviruses. the combination of elongated lungs and caudal air sacs may contribute significantly to the outcome of the disease. new nidoviruses were recently identified in the lungs of cattle and wild shingleback lizards with pneumonia. new nidoviruses can be entero- and pneumotropic (31, 55, 56) the study was performed on 16 green tree pythons (Morelia viridis) from six breeding collections in Switzerland and one collection in Germany. the collections varied in both size (i.e., the number of breeding animals) and species range, from a single snake up to a collection of 50 snakes of various species. the remaining four snakes (animals G2 to G5) did not show any changes in the airways or lungs. samples from all organs were collected and fixed in 10% buffered formalin for histological examination. lung tissue samples from the freshly euthanized snake (animal A2) and from two snakes that were necropsied within a few hours after death (animals B1 and D1) were fixed in glutaraldehyde-paraformaldehyde. smalln (0.05 mg/ml), l-glutamine (2 mM, Biochrom), 10% tryptose phosphate broth (Difco) and 20 l -d-glucose (in 90 g/liter phosphate-buffered saline [PBS]) were incubated at 30\u00b0C in 5% CO2. cell cultures were used for inoculations at passages 8 to 15 for the M. viridis cell lines protease inhibitor cocktail tablets were added to the supernatant. for negative staining, samples were adsorbed onto carbon-coated parlodion films. samples were stained with 2% phosphotungstic acid (PTA; pH 7.0; Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) RNA was isolated from the lungs of three diseased snakes (animals A2, B1, and D1, Table 1) with the TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNA samples were initially treated with DNase I (Fermentas), followed by repurification with a GeneJET RNA purification kit. a Ribo-Zero Gold rRNA removal kit for epidemiology was used according to the manufacturer's protocol. contigs from lung tissue sample run were initially screened by nucleotide sequence analysis with the BLAST program (blastn; https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) contigs matching sequences of ball python nidovirus (BPNV; NCBI reference sequence accession number NC_024709.1) and python nidovirus (PNV; GenBank accession number the amino acid sequences of conserved ORF1b were aligned using the ClustalW algorithm implemented in the MEGA (version 6.06) program (62), followed by manual refinement. phylogenetic trees were constructed using the Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) method implemented in the BEAST (version 1.8.0) program (63). qRT-PCR was performed on an Applied Biosystems 7500 fast real-time PCR system using 96-well plates. reaction volume consisted of 12.5 l of one-Step qRT-PCR master mix (Eurogentec), 1 l each of the forward and reverse primers (10 M), 1 l of probe (10 M), 0.125 l of reverse transcriptase (Euroscript RT and RNase inhibitor mix; Eurogentec), 5 l (750 ng) of RT-PCR was set up with 40 cycles between the third and fourth steps. the data were collected during the fourth step of the RT-PCR program. the genome was aligned with the BPNV and PNV genomes. individual colonies were grown in 5 ml of LB supplemented with 100 g/ml ampicillin overnight. the plasmids were purified using a GeneJET plasmid miniprep kit. the plasmids were sequenced using T7 forward and reverse primers. the generated antiserum was cleaned by affinity purification by a method similar to the methods described previously. 500 g of purified recombinant N protein was dialyzed in PBS, followed by coupling to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B. the cells were fixed by replacing the supplemented growth medium with 4% electron microscopy-grade paraformaldehyde in PBS, followed by 15 min of incubation at room temperature. after fixation, the cells were washed once with PBS, permeabilized (0.25% Triton X-100 and 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS), and left in PBS until they were stained. the cell culture supernatant was collected at 0, 1, 2, and 3 dpi. at each time point, 47 l was collected from each well. samples from replicate wells were pooled to make 140 l. rabbit polyclonal antibody demonstrated nidovirus N protein in tissue sections. sections were incubated in peroxidase-blocking solution (Dako) for 10 min. the reaction was visualized with diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride. clonal antibody; asp175; clone 5A1E; cell signaling technology) to demonstrate apoptotic cells, and for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (mouse anti-rat PCNA; clone PC10; Dako) to detect proliferating cells. intestinal epithelium was used as a positive control for all three detection systems. the faveolae are covered by a single-layered epithelium similar to that in the mammalian lung. the faveolae are covered by flat type I pneumocytes with thin, cytoplasmic extensions that cover the pulmonary capillaries. the surfactant-producing type II pneumocytes are cuboidal cells with short microvilli that contain lamellar bodies and numerous micropinocytotic vesicles. epithelium in region 1 in several diseased animals. we counted the total number of epithelial cell nuclei in each of three 200-m segments in all three regions in the cytokeratin-stained section. a P value of 0.05 for significance was used for all calculations. the initial study population was represented by nine snakes. four (animals A1 to A4) were from one breeder (breeder A), two from a second breeder (breeder B; animals B1 and B2) and one from a third breeder (breeder C; animals C1 and C2). one (animal D1) was from a fourth breeder (breeder D) cultures of primary tissues from the Morelia viridis snakes were established as described previously (59), using brain and liver material from a fetus. tissue was trimmed into blocks (1 mm), suspended in 5 ml of minimal essential medium (MEM), gentamicin (0.05 mg/ml), l-glutamine (2 mM, Biochrom), 10% tryptose phosphate broth (Difco), and 20 l -d-gluco supernatants were frozen at 20\u00b0C, pooled, and filtered through a 0.45-m-pore-size filter. one milliliter of the filtered homogenate of lung tissue was further diluted 1:10. the medium was changed at 1- to 2-day intervals until most cells detached or died. the pellets were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4) and embedded in resin by routine procedures for TEM (59) the supernatant was collected from the infected liver cells at 2-day intervals until 8 dpi. the supernatant was collected from the infected I/1Ki cells at 2-day intervals until 8 dpi. libraries were quantified using a NEBNext Ultra RNA library preparation kit. pooled libraries were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq sequencer (Illumina) using an miSeq reagent kit (version 3; Illumina) with 291-bp reads (for lung tissue samples) and 300-bp reads (for RNA isolated from the cell culture supernatant) from both ends (paired-end reads) elia viridis nidovirus (MVNV) was obtained via de novo assembly from RNA isolated from the cell culture supernatant. the contig coverage was determined using the reference alignment of the entire NGS data determined by use of the Bowtie2 program in the Unipro UGENE bioinformatics tool kit. RNA was extracted from lung tissue samples with a TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies) and mechanical homogenization with a MagNA Lyser homogenizer (Roche) the RNA was purified with a Qiagen minikit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's protocol for RNA cleanup. qRT-PCR was performed on an Applied Biosystems 7500 fast real-time PCR system using 96-well plates. reaction volume consisted of 12.5 l of one-Step qRT-PCR master mix (Eurogentec), 1 l each of the forward and reverse primers (10 M), 1 l of probe (10 M), 0.125 l of reverse transcriptase (Euroscript RT and RNase inhibitor mix; Eurogentec), 5 l (750 ng) of cDNA transcription was done using primers designed according to the Champion pET directional TOPO expression kit's manual. the PCR product was purified from the agarose gel using a GeneJET gel extraction kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and ligated to the pET101/D-TOPO vector with an N-terminal V5 epitope and His tags (Thermo Fisher Scientific) the protein in the elution buffer (50 mM Tris, 500 mM NaCl, 300 mM imidazole, 8 M urea, pH 7.5) was concentrated using a 10-kDa-cutoff Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter unit. buffer exchange (to 25 mM Tris, 75 mM NaCl, pH 7.5) was achieved by decreasing the urea concentration slowly using a slide-A-Lyzer di antibody was mixed with glycerol (50%) and stored in aliquots at 20\u00b0C. immunofluorescence staining, qRT-PCR of cell culture supernatants, and estimation of virus titer. anti-MVNV N protein antiserum diluted 1:2,000 yielded the best signal-to-noise ratio. samples from replicate wells were pooled to make 140 l. samples were stored frozen at 20\u00b0C prior to RNA isolation. dilution of the MVNV stock was prepared to reach a 1:106 dilution. 15 l of each dilution was pipetted into 12 parallel wells. sections (4 to 5 m) were prepared and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. a formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded cell pellet prepared from infected cells served as a positive control. sections from the lungs and trachea were also stained by IH for cytokeratins. intestinal epithelium was used as a positive control for all three detection systems. dapB (the bacterial gene coding for dihydrodipicolinate reductase) was used as a negative control. RNA preservation was confirmed by the detection of a housekeeping gene encoding ubiquitin C (ubc) the average total height of the epithelial layer in each of the three regions was determined. the distance between the apical epithelial cell border and the basal membrane was measured at each of 10 points over three 300-m-wide epithelial segments."}
