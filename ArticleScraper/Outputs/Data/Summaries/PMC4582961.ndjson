{"summary": "classification of CD4+ T cells defines distinct subsets but struggles to convey the complex and dynamic nature of T-cell function. in 1986, Mosmann, Coffman and colleagues classified T helper cell clones according to their distinct patterns of cytokine secretion. the framework fulfils the basic desire of most biologists to bring order to the world armed only with a dichotomous key. Treg cells co-expressing effector-associated transcription factors along with Foxp3 can produce pro-inflammatory cytokines. cytokine production and inflammatory potential are also found in mice and humans. asis 106 CD161-18 IL-2 107 RA13 IL-1R1+53 TGF-b16,17 CCR7+53 IL-6 15 Mast cells 105 Mouse T-bet 19,20,23,25\u201327,38,56,57 IFN- 19,20,23,25\u201327,54\u201356,59 CXCR3+ 19,26,27,38,57 IFN- 19,27,108 IL-2 20,54,56,59 Retained 19,20 IL-6 and IL-1 can also induce IL-17 production in Treg cells10,11. in vivo, high frequencies of Foxp3+ ROR-T+ Treg cells are found in the lamina propria. this suggests they may have a role in maintaining immunological homeostasis. IFN-+ Treg cells from patients with multiple sclerosis show reduced suppressive potential. targeting Th1-associated cytokines may increase Treg function as well as having direct anti-inflammatory effects. Gata3 supports and maintains Treg function at diverse inflammatory sites29,30. in the steady state Gata3+ Treg cells are prevalent in gut-associated lymphoid tissues. by interacting directly with Foxp3, Gata3 can suppress ROR- expression and IL-17 production,29\u201331 thereby restraining the pro-inflammatory potential of Treg cells. the first evidence of human Treg cells producing IL-4 and IL-13 has emerged from study of skin samples from patients with systemic sclerosis. a higher proportion of Treg cells produced IL-13 and IL-4 than in the skin of healthy control subjects. these studies emphasize the need to study the behaviour of Treg cells in tissues and at inflammatory interfaces. IL-6 produced by synovial fibroblasts promotes loss of Foxp3 and production of IL-17 by Treg cells. these IL-17-producing Treg cells are also found in both mice and humans. IL-12rB2 expression is slower and lower in Treg cells, limiting STAT4 activation and preventing full acquisition of a Th1 effector phenotype. the amount of either IFN- or IL-17 produced by Treg cells is typically lower than seen in their conventional Th17 and Th1 counterparts. Gata3 expression in Treg cells is induced by T-cell receptor (TCR) activation and IL-2, independently of STAT6 and IL-4/IL-13. this may underpin both the general importance of Gata3 to Treg function and the ability of IL-2 to prevent production of IL-17 by Treg cells. the current paradigm suggests that Treg cells co-expressing effector associated transcription factors exist to facilitate efficient control of the related effector responses. the model proposes that more efficient homing (as a result of a shared profile of chemokine receptor expression between Treg and effector cells) or invocation of subset-specific suppressive mechanisms act to optimize regulation. Treg cells recruited to the inflamed central nervous system (CNS) have elevated expression of T-bet and are uniformly CXCR3+. however, T-bet-deficient Treg cells are unimpaired in their ability to home to the CNS. effector-Treg\u2019 phenotype and expression of IL-10,42 a cytokine also capable of suppressing both Th1 and Th17 responses. inability of STAT3-deficient Treg cells to control Th17 responses provides a clear parallel with the inability of T-bet/ Treg cells to modulate Th1-mediated inflammation during infection. a subset of highly activated Treg cells express ST2 (the IL-33 receptor) and respond to IL-33 with increased proliferation, activation and elevated Gata3 expression. interleukin-33 also increased expression of molecules involved in tissue homing. IL-33 is suppressed by IL-23, demonstrating a further way in which IL-23 can act to destabilize the Treg phenotype. this pathway represents a novel means where cells out-with the immune system can act to promote Treg stability and function during inflammation. Treg cells induced to produce IL-17 in vitro never equals the level of induction seen following stimulation of naive conventional T cells in the presence of TGF- and IL-6.7,11. highly activated Treg cells are IL-6Ra-negative, fail to phosphorylate STAT3 in response to IL-638 and cannot be induced to produce IL-17. reduced sensitivity to IL-6 in Treg cells at inflammatory sites can serve as a potent the first direct evidence that up to 50% of Treg cells can lose Foxp3 expression after transfer to the lymphopenic environment of Rag2/ mice. however, cells that had lost Foxp3 expression subsequently gained a capacity for production of IL-2 and IFN- and showed pathogenic potential upon secondary transfer. loss of Foxp3 expression, or gain of effector function, may have led to an accumulation of cells with an ex-Treg phenotype over time. the pulse-labelling approach avoids the accumulation of these cells in the \u2018ex-Treg\u2019 pool. further epigenetic studies of natural Treg cells have revealed Treg-specific CpG demethylation profiles in other genes. scurfy-like phenotype that develops following diphtheria toxin-mediated deletion of Treg cells shows that redirection of Treg cells to effector function is not required to initiate autoimmune disease. autoimmune inflammation in immunodeficient mice can develop in the absence of Treg cells. deletion of Foxp3 in mature Treg cells leads to loss of suppressor function and resultant Foxp3 Treg cells were unable to prevent the development of severe autoimmune disease. in vitro expansion of ex-Treg cells from CNS autoantigen-immunized mice generated population of ex-Treg cells capable of inducing EAE after transfer to sub-lethally irradiated hosts. in vitro expansion of ex-Treg cells generated population of ex-Treg cells capable of inducing EAE after transfer to sub-lethally irradiated hosts. removing effector function in a minor population of cytokine-producing cells would have a limited effect on the clinical course of disease. a demonstration of reduced pathology in the absence of effector function specifically in Treg cells would provide the most convincing demonstration that Treg cells can contribute to, as well as suppress inflammation. 78,79 iTreg cells that have been induced to lose Foxp3 expression can induce colitis. however, this again required serial transfer into secondary lymphopenic hosts. even large numbers of ex-iTreg cells failed to induce EAE, emphasizing the importance of the environment in setting the threshold for pathogenic potential. cytokine signalling 1 decreases phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3, which drive Treg cells towards Th1 and Th17 differentiation. 86 SOCS-1-deficient Treg cells rapidly lose Foxp3 expression. inhibition of Janus kinase (JAK-STAT-signalling) may also provide a therapeutic means to stabilize Treg suppressive function. IL-2, IL-10 and TGF- can all act to strengthen the Treg transcriptional programme. treatment with anti-IL-12 and anti-IFN- enhance the suppressive capacity of human Th1-like Treg cells22. gain of effector function in these extreme settings could be a case of needs must when the devil drives. overcoming Treg-mediated suppression by local delivery of IL-12 allows eradication of tumours in a murine model of glioblastoma. gene-prone mice also have an elevated frequency of ROR-T Treg cells. deletion of ROR-T specifically within Treg cells provides increased immunosurveillance and decreased polyposis. local modulation of Treg function provides a means to effectively modulate immune responses. our understanding of Treg cells becomes less one-dimensional and the capacity to modulate immunity by targeting Treg function looks set to increase."}
