{"summary": "\"viral pathogens......reference assays\" was changed to \"sensitivity of the Luminex........(270/294)\" Results/Baseline results: 15 changed to 15 Results/Evaluation of the test performance: Sentence \"for individual targets, positive detection by Luminex among references was more often for 12 targets\" acute respiratory infections (ARI) are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in infants and children worldwide. in Vietnam, there is a high burden of ARI in children in the first year of life, who are more likely to be admitted to intensive care. the introduction of multiplex PCR for detection of a panel of respiratory pathogens enables faster results, higher throughput and lower cost 13, 14. samples were derived from the Vietnam initiative on Zoonotic infections (VIZIONS) study 20. the study was approved by the local ethical committee and the Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee. written informed consent was obtained from patients or parents/legal guardians if the patient was a child prior to enrolment into the study. d and subjected to total nucleic acid extraction after addition of internal control. equine arteritis virus was eluted in 50 ul of elution buffer. extracted nucleic acids were stored at -80\u00b0C for further analyses. influenza A virus, influenza A virus subtype H1 (1977), influenza A virus subtype H3 and InFB were tested in the above specific RT-PCRs. the reference was considered to be positive if any one of the reference assays was positive. Luminex assay was evaluated as diagnostic yields and sensitivity against reference assays. agreement between the Luminex and reference assays was determined by Kappa statistic using SPSS version 23. nose and throat swabs were collected from each patient in separate tubes containing 1ml of sterile viral transport medium (VTM), including MEM Hanks: 500ml, gelatin 5%: 50ml and antibiotics. four hundred forty-two samples were simultaneously tested with the Luminex assay and reference assays. the Luminex assay includes reagents to detect influenza A virus (infA: generic, H1N1 (1977), H1N1pdm09, H3N2), Influenza B virus (InFB), enteroviruses including rhinoviruses (ENT/Rhi), human parainfluenza viruses 1\u20134 (PIV1-4), human metapneumovirus (aDV), human coronavirus NL63 (hCoV NL63), h primer set targeting HA (haemagglutinin) gene segment 4 was performed using primer set targeting HA (haemagglutinin) gene segment 4 (forward primer, 5\u2019-GTTACCCAGGAGATTTCATCGA-3; reverse primer, 5\u2019-CATGCTGCCGTTACACCTTTTTG-3\u2019; and probe, 5\u2019-FAM-AAGTTCATCATCATCATCATCATCATCATGTACGA-BHQ1-3\u2019 [FAM, 6-carbox Luminex assay was evaluated as diagnostic yields and sensitivity against reference assays with 95% confidence interval using 2x2 tables. agreement between the Luminex and reference assays was determined by Kappa statistic using SPSS version 23. the frequency of pathogens detected by Luminex and reference assays was 379 and 292 respectively. the Luminex assay had a higher detection rate for most viruses. the Luminex assay had a higher detection rate for most viruses. s were also detected by Luminex assay (true positive rate or \u201csensitivity\u201d against reference assays as gold standard) there were 112 pathogens detected by Luminex but not detected by references, corresponding to an additional 1.8% (95%CI: 1.4-2.1) positives. in addition, there were 24 pathogens detected by reference assays. hCoV (OC43, NL63, HKU1) 16 4 2 420 88.8 (65.3-98.6) 0.9 (0.2-2.3) 0.83 (0.71-0.94) RSVA 9 0 1 432 100 (55.4-99.7) 0.0 (0.0-0.0) 0.95 (0.84-1.05) RSVB 10 0 3 429 76.9 (46.2-94.9) 0.0 (0.0-0.0) 0.87 (0.73-1.00) PIV4 5 43.4% (69/159) of ENT/Rhi were detected by Luminex. concordance between the two techniques was noted in 372 samples. discordance was recorded in 70 samples, showing substantial agreement. a total of 442 samples collected between November 2012 and April 2014 were analysed for the evaluation of the Luminex assay. ENT/Rhi was the most frequently detected pathogen by the two techniques. hBoV (n = 45, 11%) and PIV3 (n = 42, 10%) the frequency of pathogens detected by Luminex and reference assays was 379 and 292 respectively. the Luminex assay had a higher detection rate for most viruses. hBoV, RSV and InFB also had higher detection rates. 270 pathogens detected by reference assays were also detected by Luminex assay. there were 112 pathogens detected by Luminex but not detected by reference assays. there were 24 pathogens detected by reference assays but not detected by the Luminex.

CDC Realtime RTPCR assay - Flu B (CDC): results of influenza A and types from the reference assay: CDC Realtime RTPCR assay - Flu B (CDC) it was defined \"pos\" if sample was positive with any of reference assays or Luminex assay, \"undiagnosed\" if sample was negative with all reference assays and the Luminex assay. a Luminex assay on respiratory swabs collected from patients admitted to four provincial hospitals in Vietnam was a positive test. 5 targets (ENT/Rhi, ADV, hMPV, PIV4 and PIV1) were all more often detected by Luminex than reference assays. this suggests that detection using Luminex is superior to reference assays for these targets. a high number of +L/-ref for Ent/Rhi agent shows a significant difference with other studies in previous xTAG Luminex studies 15, 18, 23\u2013 25. detection rate for hBoV was significantly higher in reference assays than in the Luminex (10 versus 2, p=0.04) hBoV found in this study (P=0.04) is also a weakness of this kit. limitations are lack of a true gold standard as is commonly seen when evaluating diagnostic assays. low numbers of positive samples may conceal true diagnostic rates for these viruses."}
