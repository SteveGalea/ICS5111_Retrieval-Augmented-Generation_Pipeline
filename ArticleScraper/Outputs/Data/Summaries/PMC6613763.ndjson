{"summary": "emergence of Zika virus in the western Hemisphere revealed previously unrecognized disease manifestations. contemporary Zika virus strains encode a glycosylated envelope protein. some historical Zika virus strains lack this glycosylation. the host mRNA transcript, C19ORF66, broadly escapes herpesviral endonuclease cleavage and functions as a Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus restriction factor. this approach can be used to identify new antiviral factors and study virus-host coevolution. a new vaccination strategy employs \u201cmosaic\u201d hemagglutinins as universal influenza B virus vaccine candidates. Sequential vaccination with mosaic hemagglutinins confers protection against multiple influenza B strains in mice."}
