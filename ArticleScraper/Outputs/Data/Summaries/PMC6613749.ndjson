{"summary": "arteriviridae consists of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), equine arteritis virus (EAV), lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) of mice, simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV), and the recently identified wobbly possum disease virus (WPDV) stallions are susceptible to EAV infection; persistently infected stallions can infect and cause abortion ORFs 1a and 1b encode two long nonstructural precursor polyproteins. these polyproteins are subsequently cleaved into mature nonstructural proteins (nsp\u2019s) by ORF1a-encoded proteases (17). nsp1 and nsp2 are involved in cleavage at the nsp1/2 and nsp2/3 sites. nsp4 proteins of PRRSV are responsible for its self-cleavage s) are crucial antiviral cytokines in innate immune responses (24, 25) Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5), and Laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2) serve as the main pattern recognition receptors for recognizing viral RNA (26). viral 3CLpro and 3Cpro have been identified as IFN antagonists. nsp4 impairs RIG-I/MDA5 signaling by cleaving adaptor molecule NEMO. nsp4 can also cleave NEMO by identifying glutamine (Q) at the P1 position. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with the IFN--Luc plasmid (0.1 g), the pRL-TK plasmid (0.02 g) and various concentrations (0.2, 0.4, or 0.8 g) of plasmids encoding EAV nsp4. these cells were then infected with SEV at 24 h posttransfection. their supernatants were collected 16 h after SEV infection. nsp4-D65A, or nsp4-S120A, reveals protease activity of EAV nsp4 is involved in antagonizing IFN- production. nsp4 disrupts RIG-I/MDA5 signaling by targeting NEMO. in response to infections with various RNA viruses, RIG-I/MDA5 signaling plays a pivotal role in mediating the induction of IFN- (34) HEK293T cells were cotransfected with wild-type Flag-NEMO. at 30 h posttransfection, they were harvested for Western blotting. wild-type EAV nsp4 or its protease-defective mutant was cotransfected. NEMO-K277A remained susceptible to EAV nsp4 cleavage. no faster-migrating bands were observed for cells transfected with IPS-1 or HEK293T. plasmids were transfected into HEK293T cells along with NEMO expression plasmids. the size of the smallest-migrating protein band in nsp4-mediated cleavage was similar to that in PRRSV nsp4-mediated cleavage. only NEMO E349 has been reported to be cleaved by PRRSV nsp4. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with flag-tagged NEMO-WT. cell lysates were collected at 30 h posttransfection and assessed by Western blotting. cells were harvested for Western blotting at different time points (12, 24, or 36 h) postinfection. PK-15 cells were infected with transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) the protein level of endogenous NEMO was detected by Western blotting. the results showed that the endogenous NEMO level was not reduced with the duration of TGEV infection. however, the mRNA level of endogenous NEMO in EAV- and PRRSV-infected cells was not significantly different from that in mock-infected cells. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with NEMO nsp4 and flag-tagged NEMO-WT or flag-tagged NEMO-E349A. the cells were harvested at 30 h posttransfection and analyzed by Western blotting. NEMO E349 is one common cleavage position for NEMO cleavage. a series of mutants in which the E residues among the NEMO peptides spanning amino acids (aa) 155 to 179 were targeted was constructed based on the truncation mutant NEMO(1\u2013349). NEMO mutants containing E155A, E161A, E166A, E171A, or E179A mutations were each cotransfected into cells along with PRRSV nsp4. NEMO(E166A-E171A-E349A) was cotransfected into HEK293T cells. resulting blot revealed that the two smallest bands were not present in lysates from NEMO(E166A-E171A-E349A)-transfected cells. this finding indicates that EAV nsp4 can target NEMO at common residues E166, E171 and E349. EAV nsp4 cleaves NEMO by recognizing Q and E residues at the P1 position. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with NEMO(E166A-E171A-E349A) or NEMO(E166A-E171A-E210A-E349A) along with EAV nsp4. NEMO(1\u2013189) or NEMO(1\u2013216) was used as a HEK293T cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding wild-type NEMO or its mutant NEMO(E166A-E171A-Q205A-E349A) the cells were lysed at 30 h posttransfection and treated as described in the legend of Fig. 4C. Western blot analyses revealed that the fourth unidentified 20-kDa cleavage product was not present in cells expressing NEMO(Q205A), indicating that the 20-kDa cleavage product was caused by recognition of Q205. to confirm this result, a NEMO mutant containing four consecutive mutations, NEMO(E166A-E171A-Q205A-E349A), was constructed. PRRSV nsp4 cleaved only three substrates, not including the substrate containing cleavage site Q205. these results were consistent with our above-described results in vivo. nsp4-mediated NEMO cleavages are involved in the inhibition of type I IFN induction. NEMO-K277A(167\u2013349), NEMO-K277A(172\u2013349), NEMO-K277A(206\u2013349), and NEMO-K277A(350\u2013419) failed to activate IFN-dependent promoter activity. nsp4-mediated NEMO cleavage is involved in the inhibition of type I IFN induction. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with NEMO-K277A(1\u2013349) and various concentrations of PRRSV nsp4 (A) or EAV nsp4 (B) similar results were found in the presence of EAV nsp4 and PRRSV nsp4. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with the IFN--Luc plasmid (0.1 g), the pRL-TK plasmid (0.02 g) and various concentrations of plasmids encoding EAV nsp4. this data confirm the antagonistic property of EAV nsp4 in type I IFN signaling. the catalytic dyad of EAV nsp4 comprises the residues His39 (H39), Asp65 (D65), and Ser120 (S120), and any single mutation of these three residues could disrupt the protease activity of EAV nsp4 (3). nsp4 disrupts RIG-I/MDA5 signaling by targeting NEMO. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with flag-appended RIG-I, MDA5, IPS-1, NEMO-WT, or an empty vector. nsp4 significantly inhibited the activation of the IFN- promoter. however, the TBK1-induced activation of the IFN- promoter was not affected by EAV nsp4. wild-type EAV nsp4 or its protease-defective mutant (H39A, D65A, or S120A) was cotransfected along with the NEMO expression plasmid and treated as described above for panel C. IB, immunoblot. the signaling molecules upstream of TBK1 were cotransfected into HEK293T cells along with EAV nsp4. cleavage of NEMO depends on protease activity of nsp4. both EAV and PRRSV encode nsp4 proteins with similar structures and functions. nsp4 cleaves NEMO at glutamate 349 (E349) to produce a single faster-migrating protein band. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with flag-tagged NEMO-WT and EAV nsp4 or PRRSV nsp4. the supernatants were harvested 30 h after transfection and analyzed by Western blotting. PK-15 cells in 6-well plates were infected with TGEV. cells were collected at different time points (12, 24, or 36 h) postinfection. mRNA levels of endogenous NEMO were assessed by real-time RT-PCR. E166, E171, and E349 are three common sites of NEMO cleavage. cleavage characteristics of EAV nsp4 and PRRSV nsp4 lie in positions similar to those of the three EAV nsp4 cleavage products. NEMO with an E349A mutation (NEMO-E349A) was transfected into HEK293T cells. NEMO mutants were cloned by overlap extension PCR using NEMO(1\u2013349) as the template and fused with an N-terminal Flag tag. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with NEMO-WT or NEMO(E166A-E171A-E349) along with PRRSV nsp4 or a NEMO mutant. V nsp4 cleaved the NEMO mutants containing E155A, E161A, and E179A mutations into two products. only a single cleavage product was present in cells transfected with NEMO mutants containing E166A or E171A. a NEMO mutant with multiple mutations, NEMO(E166A-E171A-E349A), was constructed and cotransfected into HEK nsp4 cleaves NEMO by recognizing Q and E residues at the P1 position. results from experiments using the two truncation mutants NEMO(1\u2013189) and NEMO(1\u2013216) showed that the cleavage position of the unidentified fourth cleavage product was located between residues 189 and 216. however, a mutation in NEMO residue E210 did not affect the presence of the fourth cleavage product from HEK293T cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding wild-type NEMO or its mutant NEMO(E166A-E171A-Q205A-E349A) along with EAV nsp4. the cells were treated as described in the legend of Fig. 4C. nsp4 cleaved NEMO-derived substrates in vitro. four fluorogenic peptide substrates were introduced with nsp4. ns, nonsignificant (P > 0.05); **, P 0.01; **, P 0.01; **, P 0.001. nsp4-mediated NEMO cleavages are involved in the inhibition of type I IFN induction. a series of deletion mutants was constructed from the constitutively active NEMO cleavage sites. nsp4-mediated NEMO cleavages are involved in the inhibition of type I IFN induction. NEMO-K277A(1\u2013166), NEMO-K277A(1\u2013171), NEMO-K277A(1\u2013205), NEMO-K277A(206\u2013349), and NEMO-K277A(350\u2013419) failed to activate IFN-dependent promoter activity. nsp4-mediated NEMO cleavage is involved in the inhibition of type I IFN induction. HEK293T and PK-15 cells were transfected with expression plasmids for NEMO-K277A or indicated deletion mutants along with the IFN--Luc plasmid and the pRL-TK plasmid. the cells were then lysed, and their IFN- activity was assessed by luciferase assays. NEMO(1\u2013349) retains the ability to activate IFN- production. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding EAV nsp4 or the related H39A, D65A, or S120A mutant. the cells were lysed at 28 h posttransfection and used in luciferase assays. catalytically inactive mutants of viral proteases, such as PEDV nsp5 (43) and FMDV 3Cpro (44), still retain weak inhibition of SEV-induced IFN production. however, repression of SEV-mediated IFN- promoter activation was strongly relieved with the overexpression of wild-type EAV nsp4 mutants. PRRSV nsp4 blocks NF-B signaling by targeting NEMO at a single site, E349 (33) however, the cleavage fragment NEMO(1\u2013349) still activates IFN- production. the results showed that the cleavage fragment yielded by cleaving NEMO at E349 could also activate the NF-B promoter. SVV 3Cpro could cleave MAVS, TRIF, and TANK. but the corresponding cleavage products were not detected during SVV infection (45). however, we failed to detect the endogenous cleavage products of NEMO in PRRSV-infected porcine alveolar macrophages or in EAV-infected Marc-145 cells. a similar occurrence has been reported for encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) and SVV 3Cpro-mediated TANK cleavages. both EMCV and SVV belong to the family Picornaviridae. while their 3Cpro proteins target TANK at a common residue, SVV also cleaves TANK at another site, E272 (45, 46). additional studies should be conducted to determine which part of the 3C crystal structures revealed that the nsp4 proteins of PRRSV and EAV each contain three domains, including two chymotrypsin-like -barrel domains and an extra C-terminal /-domain. coronavirus nsp5 proteins exhibit a common P1-Q preference for substrate specificity. nsp4 demonstrates a preference for Glu (E) and Gln (Q) at the P1 position to target NEMO the structure-based sequence alignment was generated using the ESPript website (http://espript.ibcp.fr/ESPript/ESPript/index.php). the structure-based sequence alignment was generated using the ESPript website (http://espript.ibcp.fr/ESPript/ESPript/index.php). the structure of arterivirus nsp4 in complex with substrates remains unclear. NEMO plays an indispensable role in the type I IFN production pathway (47) different viruses can disrupt IFN signaling through interaction with NEMO or NEMO-interacting partners. arterivirus nsp4 and PRRSV nsp4 cleave NEMO at multiple sites. only EAV nsp4 could target NEMO at site Q205. cleavage of NEMO led to suppression of type I IFN signaling pathway. plasmid pEAV030 (54) was a kind gift from Eric J. Snijder. TGEV strain WH-1 (55), which was isolated in china in 2010, was propagated in PK-15 cells. luciferase reporter plasmids for IFN--Luc were described previously. expression plasmids for RIG-I, IPS-1, MDA5, NEMO-K277A, TBK1 and NEMO were constructed. all constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. the expressions of PRRSV nsp4 and EAV nsp4 were evaluated using an anti-HA tag (ABclone, China) anti-PRRSV N protein monoclonal antibody was used to detect the expression of PRRSV N protein. optical density at 600 nm (OD600) reached 0.6 to 0.8. both PRRSV/EAV nsp4 expression and purification were carried out as described previously. the coronavirus 3CLpro-substrate complex (PDB accession number 2Q6G) was a model for alignment. the distributions of hydrogen bonds and hydrophilic interactions between arterivirus nsp4 and its substrate were generated by the LigPlot+ program. all tests were performed in triplicate. eukaryotic expression plasmid for PRRSV nsp4 was cloned into vector pCAGGS-HA-C. mutants were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis to create mutant forms deprived of catalytic activity. NEMO constructs with an N-terminal Flag tag were cloned by overlap extension PCR using NEMO-WT or NEMO-K277A as the template. the cells were infected with SEV 24 h after transfection. at 16 h postinfection, the cells were collected for detection of luciferase and Renilla luciferase activities. anti-EAV N protein monoclonal antibody was a kind gift from XiaoJun Wang. RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR were performed three times. fluorogenic peptide substrates, Dabcyl-EAATKECQALEE-Edans, Dabcyl-CQALEGRARAAE-Edans, Dabcyl-DQLRMQGQSVE-Edans, and Dabcyl-KASCQESARIEDE-Edans were derived from NEMO containing four cleavage sites. the donor and receptor fluorophores formed a quenching all tests were performed in triplicate using Student\u2019s t test."}
