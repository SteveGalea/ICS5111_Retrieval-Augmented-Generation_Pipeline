{"summary": "the genome of IAV contains eight single-stranded, negative-sense viral RNA (vRNA) segments [1]. vRNAs reside within the virion as viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complexes bound to a viral polymerase and many copies of nucleoprotein (NP) vRNA segments PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NA, M and NS of IAV are indicated. black boxes at the end indicate the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 non-coding regions. numbers represent nucleotide lengths for each vRNA. replication and transcription of influenza vRNAs is carried out by NP and the three polymerase subunits, an acidic (PA) and two basic (PB1 and PB2) proteins. newly synthesized vRNP complexes are then exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm by the nuclear export protein (NEP) and the matrix protein 1 (M1), and are assembled into virions at the plasma membrane [1]. IAV of three HA subtypes (H1, H2 and H3) thus gained the ability to be transmitted efficiently among humans [24] only two classes of antivirals are approved for IAV that target either the ion channel function of the matrix 2 (M2) protein or the neuraminidase function of the NA protein. readout can be used with high throughput screenings (HTS) and to assess viral infection in tissue culture cells and animals models without the use of secondary approaches to identify the presence of the virus. reporter genes have a noteworthy role in multiple applications, both in vitro and in vivo. luciferase enzymes isolated from different animal species have different variability in light emission, sensitivities, and emission duration times that accommodate different experimental designs. new secreted versions of luciferases [48] and shorter versions of luciferase genes [49] have been described to facilitate detection of reporter gene expression upon viral infection. luciferase reporters preferred over fluorescent proteins because fluorescence requires excitation light to travel to the location of the fluorescent probe. luciferase substrates can be administered systemically for fluorescent targets in vivo. the genome of IAV contains eight single-stranded, negative-sense viral RNA (vRNA) segments [1]. vRNAs reside within the virion as viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complexes bound to a viral polymerase and many copies of nucleoprotein (NP) vRNA segments PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NA, M and NS of IAV are indicated. black boxes at the end indicate the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 non-coding regions. numbers represent nucleotide lengths for each of the vRNAs. replication and transcription of influenza vRNAs are carried out by NP and the three polymerase subunits, an acidic (PA) and two basic (PB1 and PB2) proteins. newly synthesized vRNP complexes are then exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm by the nuclear export protein (NEP) and the matrix protein 1 (M1), and are assembled into virions at the plasma membrane. antigenic drift occurs when the virus accumulates mutations that preclude binding by pre-existing antibodies. IAV of three HA subtypes (H1, H2 and H3) thus gained the ability to be transmitted efficiently among humans. current available options to counter IAV include both vaccines and antivirals. recombinant, reporter-expressing IAV allows for effective tracking of viral infection in vitro and in vivo. readout can be used with high throughput screenings (HTS) and to assess viral infection in tissue culture cells and animals models without the use of secondary approaches. luciferase enzymes isolated from different animal species have different variability in light emission, sensitivities, and emission duration times that accommodate different experimental designs. new secreted versions of luciferases [48] and shorter versions of luciferase genes [49] have been described to facilitate detection of reporter gene expression upon viral infection. luciferase reporters are preferred over fluorescent proteins because fluorescence requires excitation light to travel to the location of the fluorescent probe. for fluorescent targets in vivo, excitation light is scattered from tissue above the plane of the target, which reduces the intensity. IAV segmented genome allows the opportunity to tag various gene segments with fluorescent or luminescent reporters. the virus segments are small (0.9\u20132.4 kb in length) and do not tolerate large insertions. adding a reporter gene in the 3\u2032 or 5\u2032 end disrupts packaging signals located at the end of each viral RNA. reporter gene was fused to PB2; 2A site: reporter gene was separated from the viral ORF via a 2A peptide sequence. PB1 PB1 PA WSN Split Gluc Fusion Virus-host interaction. the reporter gene was separated from the viral ORF via a 2A peptide sequence. the reporter gene was introduced under the control of a duplicated 3\u2032 NCR. the NEP was removed from the NS viral segment and replaced with the foreign gene separated by a 2A site. then, the NEP was fused to the PB1 segment also separated by a 2A site. reporter gene was fused to NS1 protein separated by a peptide sequence. reporter gene was separated from viral ORF via a 2A peptide sequence. PB2 modulates vRNP assembly and is thought to contribute to viral replicase. packaging signals encoding the 3\u2032 terminus of PB2 were mutated to minimize interference with native, which are duplicated at the 3\u2032 NCR-proximal region. studies to examine intracellular vRNP trafficking were previously limited due to the difficulty of visualizing their movement in living cells. live imaging of cells infected with a split-GFP-based virus demonstrated that over the course of infection, vRNPs accumulated pericentriolarly, followed by a wide distribution throughout the cytoplasm and an accumulation at the plasma membrane. Avilov et al. observed vRNP association with Rab11 [61]. d the Gaussia luciferase (Gluc) gene into the C-terminal end of PB2 and separated the viral open reading frame from the reporter via a vRNA. silent mutations were introduced into the original 5\u2032 packaging signals in the PB2 ORF, to eliminate the original packaging signals. the virus was rescued in the backbone of influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8) [66]. mice were given the GG3 and KB2 antibodies 2 h before being infected with a 5 mouse lethal dose-50 (MLD50) the studies showed no morbidity or mortality of mice receiving the antibody therapies. PR8-Gluc had a MLD50 of 5000 plaque forming units (PFU), approximately 50\u2013100 times less lethal than MLD50 of 50. new technologies are thus needed to improve the mapping of pathogen\u2013host interactions, including IAV. a set of recombinant IAV contain a fragment (Gluc1 or Gluc2) of a split Gluc fused to the C-terminus of PB1, PB2 or PA (vP-Gluc1 or vP-Gluc2) in the WSN backbone [80] to reconstitute Gluc activity, a cell must be co-infected by two viruses the assay detected viral\u2013host protein\u2013protein interactions within their exploratory set [80]. PB1 reporter influenza A viruses: Schematic representation of the PB1 segment from WT (A) and reporter influenza A viruses as described in Figure 1. AV PA has minimal packaging sequences at the 3\u2032 and the 5\u2032 end. PA is structurally required for polymerase activity, possesses endonuclease activity to cleave host capped pre-mRNAs. the reporter virus faithfully recapitulated the known polymerase-mediated host range. PATN and PASTN virus infection is therefore a viable model for WSN infection in vitro and in vivo. Tran et al. used this system with multi-modal bioluminescence and positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging. pH1N1-PA-NLuc had WT-like kinetics both in vitro and in vivo. measured bioluminescence reduced the turnaround time of titer determination by 54 h [69] Spronken and Short et al. also generated several recombinant replication-competent IAV harboring reporter genes in the PA segment. PA_iRFP_dPR cloning strategy was used to insert different reporters into PR8, including enhanced GFP (eGFP), far-red fluorescent protein (fRFP), Gluc and FFluc. the levels of virus replication, reporter expression and stability of the reporter were evaluated. 2UP_PA-gluc_dPR, _iRFP, and _FFLuc lost considerable reporter activity after four or five passages in vitro. 2UP_PA_eGFP_sPR and _dPR pH1N1 and HPAI H5N1 and H7N9 viruses were rescued and characterized in vitro [73] each of the reporter viruses rescued grew 2 logs less than WT virus in vitro. the authors developed two new imaging tools: a system to visualize four different vRNA segments within an infected cell. a fluorescent influenza virus (WSN-PA GFP) to track vRNA dynamics in live cells during a productive infection. vRNA assembly includes the formation of flexible subcomplexes that export from the nucleus and then undergo further assembly en route to the plasma membrane. cleave sialic acid is thought to help the virus penetrate mucus. cleave sialic acid is also thought to help the virus penetrate mucus. rPR8-NA-eGFP had a viral growth kinetic similar to WT virus. rPR8-eGFP+NA replicated at lower levels (1 log or more) compared with those in rPR8-eGFP+NA. rPR8-NA+eGFP+NA\u2019s attenuated viral kinetics make rPR8-NA+eGFP the more logical choice. replication-competent IAV harboring fluorescent reporters have been ineffective for such studies and only used ex vivo. IAV-Gluc virus was attenuated in vivo; it took 1,000x more IAV-Gluc to achieve PR8 WT-like pathology. the authors tested whether IAV-Gluc can be used for evaluating antiviral therapeutics in vitro. a duplicated 3\u2032 promoter sequence (NA35-foreign gene) was inserted between the stop codon and the 5\u2032 promoter sequence of the NA segment [93] despite numerous attempts, a virus expressing GFP was not rescued. the authors demonstrated that the duplicated 3\u2032 promoter was used to drive foreign gene expression. vNA38 viruses expressed the foreign gene to higher levels than vNA35 viruses in cell culture and in the pulmonary tissue of infected mice. authors proposed this later recombinant IAV harboring the dicistronic NA segment for the development of live bivalent vaccines. recombinant rearranged IAV reached titers on order of six to seven log10 egg infectious dose (EID50)/mL, and transgene expression was maintained for up to ten passages. rearranged viruses were also attenuated in vivo. the genome rearrangement strategy was extended to influenza A/California/04/2009 (pH1N1 or Ca04) both the GlucCa04 and Res/GlucCa04 grew to significantly reduced titer levels compared to the recombinant Ca04 and Res/GlucCa04 counterparts in MDCK cells over multicycle growth. Sutton et al. used these viruses for an in vitro anti-viral screening microneutralization assay. amantadine treatment significantly decreased Gluc expression of GlucCa04 compared to Res/GlucCa04, with half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) results. in vitro, NS1-GFP was capable of replicating to WT-like titers in IFN-deficient vero cells [90]. NS1-GFP deletion mutants outcompeted NS1-GFP only contained GFP deficiencies and not NS1 mutations. the 5\u2032 are duplicated and contain NEP N-terminal amino acid codons. an HA tag and a heterologous dimerization domain (Dcm) were added after the NS1 ORF. manicassamy et al. described a replication-competent IAV that contained GFP fused to NS1 protein (NS1-GFP) of PR8 [71]. it had been previously shown that functionally active IAV NS1 and NEP could be expressed as a single polyprotein with a FMDV 2A autoproteolytic cleavage site between them. NS1-GFP replicated like WT in a single-cycle replication assay in the authors studied viral dissemination in lungs using the NS1-GFP virus. they found that infection starts in the respiratory tract in areas close to large conducting airways. a 106 PFU intranasal inoculation showed 10% of dendritic cells (DCs) were observed to express GFP. authors used NS1-GFP to demonstrate that lung-resident neutrophils are infected by IAV [110]. innate immune system is critical for antiviral clearance, but signaling can promote IAV replication. authors suggest that innate immune activation triggered by toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) and retinoic acid inducible gene-1 (RIG-I) is required for efficient IAV replication. NS1-GFP infected cells were treated with an NA inhibitor (oseltamivir) and various natural compounds. in both cases, reduced GFP expression was indicative of limited or neutralized infection. zebrafish can support infection and mount an immune response [101] a similar NS1 construct to NS1-GFP, Eckert et al. generated IAV encoding maxGFP, turboRFP, or Gluc that replicated comparably to WT PR8 [48]. NS1-maxGFP and -turboRFP dropped below 5% fluorescent positive cells on the third passage in tissue culture [48]. NS1-Gluc virus could be used to evaluate the antiviral activity of host cell proteins [48]. previous studies have suggested that the IFITM proteins act by increasing endosomal cholesterol [116]. authors found that U18666A displayed a dose dependent inhibitory effect against IAV infection in vitro [48] timer is derived from the red fluorescent protein of Discosoma (DsRed) and contains two point mutations that confer a strong quantum yield and the spectral shift phenotype. the recombinant IAV-Timer, in vitro, showed similar growth kinetics compared to the WT virus [68] the ability to use the four unique viruses for multiplex was tested in infected mice. each reporter could be observed in clusters of whole-lung explants using stereomicroscopy. color-flu can be used to study reassortment, which is implicated in the generation of pandemic strains of IAV along with the generation of human adapted strains. de Baets et al. have reported the generation of an IAV expressing GFP from a tri-cistronic NS segment in the backbone of PR8. they used a truncated NS1 protein of 73 aa combined with a heterologous dimerization domain of the Drosophila melanogaster nonclaret disjunctional protein [120] to increase protein stability. the latter treatment is of interest based on data that show efficacy of M2e IAV vaccines [121]. both treatments protected mice from weight loss post PR8-NS1(1\u201373)GFP infection. the prophylactic treatment of mice with anti-M2e MAb resulted in a decrease in the percentage of GFP-expressing cells. gene segments all contain non-coding regions (NCR), packaging signals () and open reading frames (ORF) for gene replication/transcription, virion incorporation, and protein expression, respectively. packaging signals encoding the 3\u2032 terminus of PB2 were mutated to minimize interference with native. transfected cells are required to observe fluorescence, which is simplified by generating stable cell lines expressing the same GFP trans-complementing domain. vRNPs accumulated pericentriolarly, followed by a wide distribution throughout the cytoplasm and an accumulation at the plasma membrane. t IAV containing foreign sequences [40,41,48,52,66,68,69,70,71,72,73] cloned the Gaussia luciferase (Gluc) gene into the C-terminal end of PB2 and separated the viral open reading frame from the reporter via a viral promoter. silent mutations were introduced into the original 5\u2032 packaging signals in the PB2 ORF. PR8-Gluc was used in vivo to characterize the therapeutic potential of two stalk-reactive monoclonal antibodies (GG3 and KB2) these stalk-reactive MAbs bind to many H1 and H5 IAV. mice were given the GG3 and KB2 antibodies 2 h before being infected with a 5 mouse lethal dose-50. IAV contains a fragment (Gluc1 or Gluc2) of a split Gluc fused to the C-terminus of PB1, PB2, or PA (vP-Gluc1 or vP-Gluc2) in the WSN backbone [80] to reconstitute Gluc activity, a cell must be co-infected by two viruses that, in combination, produce Gluc1 and Gluc2 [80] the split Gluc viruses could thus be used with compound libraries. a single Gluc1-tagged virus was used to infect cells transfected with Gluc2-fused host proteins. the assay detected viral\u2013host protein\u2013protein interactions within their exploratory set. IAV segment 3 encodes the polymerase subunit PA that has previously been shown to tolerate fusions to its C terminus without disrupting polymerase function. compared to other polymerase subunits, IAV PA has minimal packaging sequences at the 3\u2032 and the 5\u2032 end [1,84] mice infected with WT (PB2 K627) WSN PATN lost weight and showed robust bioluminescence that increased over time. in contrast, the virus encoding avian-signature PB2 E627 was severely restricted. a similar approach was used by Karlsson et al. to generate a PA-2A-NLuc IAV in the influenza A/California/04/2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) backbone. a similar approach was also used by Spronken and Short et al. to generate a PA-2A-NLuc IAV in the influenza A/California/04/2009 pandemic. 2UP_PA_iRFP_dPR cloning strategy was used to insert different reporters into PR8, including enhanced GFP (eGFP), far-red fluorescent protein (fRFP), Gluc and FFluc. levels of virus replication, reporter expression and stability of the reporter were evaluated. 2UP_PA-gluc_dPR, _iRFP, and _FFLuc lost considerable reporter activity after four or five passages in vitro. 2UP_PA-iRFP_dPR was chosen as a model for further studying aspects of IAV infection, such as detecting morphological changes in infected cells by fluorescence and electron microscopy (EM) the authors hypothesize that this is due to 2UP_PA-iRFP_dPR\u2019s low reporter expression. lakdawala et al. overcame this limitation by fusing the entire GFP protein to the C-terminus of PA in the backbone of a WSN-PA GFP [87] the authors developed two new imaging tools: a system to visualize four different vRNA segments within an infected cell and a fluorescent influenza virus (WSN-PA GFP) to track vRNA dynamics in live cells during a productive infection. NA segment 6 from IAV encodes the NA protein that promotes viral release and is one of the major surface viral antigens. the receptor-destroying activity in NA resides in the distal head domain that is linked to the viral membrane by an N-terminal hydrophobic transmembrane domain. the order of viral gene and fluorescent reporter did have an effect on viral growth kinetics, plaque phenotype, NA activity, or eGFP localization. in embryonated eggs, MDCK, and human lung epithelial A549 cell lines, rPR8-NA-eGFP had a viral growth kinetic similar to WT virus. the authors attribute the dissimilarities between viruses to the differences in the recombinant NA segments. rPR8-eGFP+NA has the reporter fused to the NA transmembrane anchoring region, thus localizing it to membrane. this could reduce the presence of NA on the membrane, limiting viral release. pan et al. published the generation of replication-competent IAV harboring Gluc in the NA segment using PR8 as the backbone (IAV-Gluc) the viral NA segment was similar to the described above for rPR8-NA + eGFP. it took 1,000x more IAV-Gluc to achieve PR8 WT-like pathology. Vieira Machado et al. attempted the generation of a replication-competent IAV in the backbone of WSN harboring a dicistronic NA segment. despite numerous attempts, a virus expressing GFP was not rescued. recombinant viruses expressing CAT or VP0 were successfully generated. vNA38 viruses replicated stably and more efficiently than vNA35 viruses with a dicistronic NA segment comprised of the native 5\u2032 NCR only [94] vNA38 viruses expressed the foreign gene to higher levels than vNA35 viruses in cell culture and infected mice. authors proposed this later recombinant IAV harboring the dicistronic NA segment for the development of live bivalent vaccines. the transgene was inserted downstream of either a full-length or a truncated NS1 gene. the donor site and branch point within the full-length NS1 were mutated. a stop codon was inserted early in the residual open reading frame of NEP. the genome rearrangement strategy was extended to influenza A/California/04/2009 (pH1N1 or Ca04) the researchers also rescued an amantadine-resistant virus for anti-viral drug screening purposes. the genetic stability of three separate replicates of GlucCa04 was evaluated by serial passaging five times in MDCK cells. of the three replicates, two had a ten-fold decrease in Gluc expression while one had a ten-fold increase in reporter expression after passaging. the truncated NS1 maintained the ability to antagonize type I interferon (IFN) and allowed for the insertion of a foreign gene, like GFP. the GFP-harboring IAV (NS1-GFP) was able to replicate in protein kinase R (PKR) knockout mice and reached similar viral lung titers with or without the GFP gene. multicistronic NS reporter influenza A viruses were generated by insertion of a stop/start transcription site after the NS1 ORF for independent translation of NS1, reporter gene, and NEP. a splice acceptor mutation (SAM; *) inhibits NEP alternative splicing. all viral isolates derived from infected mouse lungs were still capable of expressing GFP in infected cells. authors expressed interleukin-2 (IL-2) instead of GFP [100] using this bicistronic virus. NS1-GFP replicated like WT in a single-cycle replication assay in MDCK cells. NS1-GFP was 100x attenuated when evaluated by MLD50. in vivo, NS1-GFP was 100x attenuated compared to WT virus. authors provided evidence that lung DCs that transport viral antigens to the draining lymph nodes are protected from influenza virus infection in vivo. they also reported that lung migratory non-infected CD103+ DCs express a natural anti-viral state that is further strengthened by type I IFN released during the first few hours following influenza virus infection. authors suggest that they can act not only to stimulate the innate immune response, but to also activate CD8+ T lymphocytes to begin viral clearance in authors suggested that IAV uses physiological levels of inflammatory responses to its replicative advantage. without importin-7, NS1-GFP is unable to replicate in the alveolar epithelium. direct observation of IAV infection provides a means to evaluate antiviral therapies. previous observations using NA-deficient viruses [36] showed that microplaques of IAV appear in cell culture [104]. but the addition of actin inhibitors or microtubule stabilizers to oseltamivir treatment prohibited microplaque formation. NS1-GFP-infected cells show GFP movement from one cell to another through an intercellular connection. authors showed that NS1-Gluc virus can be used to investigate cellular proteins that exhibit inhibitory functions against IAV infection [48]. authors showed that NS1-Gluc virus can be used to investigate cellular proteins that exhibit inhibitory functions against IAV infection [48] ry was attenuated in mice, inoculation with 104 PFU resulted in infection-specific fluorescence. replication could be directly visualized and quantified from whole excised lung using IVIS [41]. the results offer a promising option to directly study the biology of IAV. Fukuyama et al. generated a series of Color-flu viruses in the backbone of PR8, expressing fluorescent proteins of different colors. each of the PR8 reporter-expressing IAV showed higher pathogenicity compared to parental viruses. color-flu can be used to study reassortment, which is implicated in the generation of pandemic strains of IAV. a truncated NS1 protein of 73 aa was fused to NS1 to facilitate protein detection. the resulting PR8-NS1(1\u201373)GFP virus replicated as efficiently as PR8 WT in vitro and retained reporter expression in 100% of plaques from 5 passages in MDCK-V cells. the resulting PR8-NS1(1\u201373)GFP virus replicated as efficiently as PR8 WT. the recombinant virus was slightly attenuated in vivo but maintained 96.4% GFP-positive plaques when recovered five days post-infection from mouse lungs. the prophylactic treatment of mice with anti-M2e MAb or oseltamivir resulted in a decrease in the percentage of GFP-expressing cells. recombinant reporter-expressing, replicating-competent IAV are applicable to translational research and have been demonstrated in screening platforms to identify specific or broadly reactive NAbs, antiviral compounds, or host proteins involved in viral replication. the combination of fluorescent or luminescent genes plus the generation of reporter IAV using different backbones have increased the spectrum of tools that can be used to facilitate the study of these IAV."}
