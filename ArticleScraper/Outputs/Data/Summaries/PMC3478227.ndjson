{"summary": "GA and GRA were tested for the ability to inhibit rotavirus replication in cell culture. levels of viral proteins VP2, VP6 and NSP2 in GRA treated cells were measured by immunofluorescent focus assay. results GRA treatment reduced rotavirus yields by 99% when added to infected cultures. vaccine efficacy is lower in developing nations where the majority of deaths from rotavirus infections occur. it could be due to suboptimal immune responses associated with poor nutritional status or concurrent enteric infections. glycyrrhizin (GA) is present in the highest concentration. activity of GA in vitro showed reduced replication of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), vaccinia virus (VV), herpes simplex 1 virus (HSV-1), but not poliovirus type 1 [18]. suggested mechanisms of activity in these systems include direct effects on the adsorption, penetration and particle maturation steps. en cells from infected animals revealed that GRA induces IFN, TNF, and IL-12. in a bacterial system, GRA attenuated lung pathology associated with Staphyloccus aureus pneumonia [29]. the relative lack of data regarding specific antiviral activity of GRA compared to GA led us to expand on previous data showing GRA treatment reduces rotavirus replication in cell culture. GA reduces rotavirus infectivity while GA has no effect. previous time course of effects of GRA on rotavirus replication showed 40% reduction in infectivity of NCDV. MA104 cells were infected with rotavirus strain RRV at a multiplicity of infection of 3 pfu/cell. 25 g/mL GRA was added to the cultures following the one hour virus adsorption period and maintained in the media throughout the infection. total virus was harvested from cells and supernatant, and yields of infectious virus were determined by IFA. RRV was inoculated onto cells at a multiplicity of infection of 3 pfu/cell. after adsorption, the medium was replaced and cultures were incubated for one hour at 37\u00b0C to allow virus entry. 25 g/mL GRA or DMSO was added to the culture following the 37\u00b0C incubation. RRV was adsorbed to the monolayer for one hour at 4\u00b0C. adsorption medium was removed and replaced with fresh medium. cultures were incubated for one hour at 37\u00b0C to allow virus entry. the lanes are triplicate samples. bands were quantified by densitometry taking the averaged intensity of the bands in the individual samples normalized to the averaged intensity of the GAPDH loading control. GRA is not toxic to MA104 cells up to the highest concentration tested of 10 g/mL. prior experiments measured replication at a low multiplicity of infection. the current experiments were designed to measure one round of replication at a higher multiplicity of infection (three pfu/cell) each compound was added to cells either six hours prior to RRV infection or following the adsorption step. RRV stock was mixed with 25 g/mL GRA or DMSO and incubated for one hour at 37\u00b0C. RRV stocks were incubated with 25 g/mL GRA or DMSO for one hour. infectivity was measured by IFA. cultures were incubated for one hour at 37\u00b0C to allow virus entry. 25 g/mL GRA or DMSO was added to the culture following the 37\u00b0C incubation. virus titers following an additional 5 hours of infection were determined by IFA. a substantial reduction in the amount of VP2 and VP6 in GRA treated cells. the same experiment was performed, except that GRA was added two hours following the 37\u00b0C incubation. the results indicated that the degree of reduction in VP2 was similar to the previous experiment. the antiviral properties of two principal pharmacologically active constituents of licorice root, GA and GRA, have been extensively described. there are ample data to suggest antiviral activity of GA in vivo may result from induction of cytoprotective and immunomodulatory responses. however, when administered intravenously, GA is metabolized in the liver by lysosomal -D-glucoronidase into 3-mono--glucoronide-glycy the reduction in yields of infectious virus and viral protein levels when GRA was added to cultures up to two hours post-adsorption suggests interference with rotavirus replication occurs at a step subsequent to virus entry [18]. Interestingly, the amount of VP2 present when GRA was added two-hours post-entry was similar to the levels observed when GRA was added one hour post-entry, but the amounts of VP6 and NSP2 were considerably higher. inflammatory mediators suggest that the effects of GRA on NFB are context-dependent. a possible alternative mechanism of replication inhibition is provided by several reports indicating GRA modulates PI3/Akt activity. the effects of GRA on these signaling pathways are under investigation. stock solutions were prepared to a concentration of 100 mg/mL in DMSO. stock solutions were diluted to working concentrations in DMEM without FBS. control for 100% cell viability or 100% toxicity consisted of cells and media alone, or treatment with digitonin. cells were inoculated with trypsin-activated RRV at a multiplicity of infection of three pfu/cell. virus was adsorbed to cells for one hour at 37\u00b0C. cells and supernatant were collected and subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles. stock solutions were prepared to a concentration of 100 mg/mL in DMSO. stock solutions were diluted to working concentrations in DMEM without FBS. control for 100% cell viability or 100% toxicity consisted of cells and media alone, or treatment with digitonin. cells were inoculated with trypsin-activated RRV at a multiplicity of infection of three pfu/cell. virus was adsorbed to cells for one hour at 37\u00b0C. cells and supernatant were collected and subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles. read and approved the final manuscript. additional support was provided by NCRR grant RR020185-09, NIGM grant GM103500-09, equipment from the Murdock Charitable Trust."}
