{"summary": "the subfamily Coronavirinae is currently classified into four genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus (2). the alphacoronaviruses (alpha-CoVs) and betacoronaviruses (beta-CoVs) are found exclusively in mammals, while the gammacoronaviruses (gamma-CoVs) and deltacoronaviruses (delt africa is a major hot spot of zoonotic emerging diseases. it is inhabited by many bats of different species, including those that serve as reservoirs of important zoonotic diseases. recent studies have provided strong evidence that HCoV-229E originated from bat viruses circulating in Africa (5). the recombination frequency can be as high as 25% for the entire CoV genome (23) under experimental conditions, the recombination frequency can be as high as 25% for the entire CoV genome (23) the global disease Detection Program (GDD) of the centers for disease control and prevention (CDC, Atlanta, GA) is focused on the detection of emerging infectious agents worldwide. a pan-coronavirus reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assay found an overall prevalence of 11.7% (240/2,050 bats) this prevalence is in line with recent reports of CoVs in bats from numerous locations. the sample number was limited and might not reflect the real prevalence. the viral sequences identified in Kenyan bats showed a remarkable diversity within both alpha- and beta-CoVs. many of the sampled bat genera are associated with more than one viral lineage. divergence of the CoVs within the same host genera may be associated with possible differences in sample types. seven such cross-species transmission events in total, each represented by a single sequence. a more comprehensive and informative phylogeny was obtained later, including the representative global CoV sequences from GenBank. the newly discovered viruses from Kenya have greatly extended our previous work (15) in terms of expanding the diversity of existing lineages. phylogeny suggests ancient virus-host codivergence and recent cross-species transmission of CoVs between bats and other mammalian hosts. coVs from two host groups, one dominated by bats and the other exclusively by nonchiropteran mammals, formed sister clades for both alpha- and beta-CoVs. we used Mantel's test to compare the virus and host genetic distance matrices, as well as virus and geographic distance matrices. the correlation values were positive and highly significant in both comparisons, suggesting both host and geography have shaped the structure of virus genetic diversity. mantel autocorrelograms showed the Kenyan bat CoV RdRp sequences stratified by geographic distances (A) and host genetic distances (B) no obvious clinal patterns in geographic distance were observed within the Kenyan data set. a mantel correlation index (r) was calculated for each of the distance classes. YNL63-15) were from the NL63-like group, and two (BtKY229E-1 and BtKY229E-8) were from the 229E-like group. the additional ORF8/ORFX was identified at the 3\u2032 end of the genome in all bat NL63-like and 229E-like viruses characterized in this study. sequence comparisons of the Kenyan bat CoVs with HCoV-229E or HCoV-NL63 HCoV sequence compared Kenyan bat CoV Genome identity (% nucleotide identity) % Amino acid identity Concatenated domains ADRP nsp12 nsp13 nsp14 nsp16 1ab S ORF3/4 E M N HCoV-229E BtKY229E-1 43 ORF1ab ORF size (nt) 20,286 20,304 20,277 20,349 20,355 Putative TRS TCTCAACTAAAC(N219)AUG CTCAACTAAAC(N219)AUG CTCAACTAAAC(N215)AUG S gene ORF size (nt) 4,095 4,095 4,095 4,119 4,122 4,134 Putative TRS TCTCAACTAAAC(N1)AUG CTCAACTAAAC(N37) phylogeny based on the ORF1b protein alignment confirmed that NL63-like and 229E-like groups are monophyletic. the relationship between HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E was also demonstrated by Corman et al. (5) based on specimens obtained in Ghana. phylogeny of the S protein suggests an entirely different evolutionary history for HCoV-NL63 compared to the rest of the genome. HCoV-NL63 was deeply nested within the 229E-like group, associated exclusively with viruses from Hipposideros bats. HCoV-NL63 evolved from a recombination event between NL63-like and 229E-like viruses. the tree is based on an amino acid alignment and midpoint rooted. to further characterize this recombination event, we performed genome-scale similarity comparisons between HCoV-NL63 and related viruses. a total of 2,050 bat samples were screened for CoV RNA using a pan-coronavirus reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assay. a total of 2,050 bat samples were screened for CoV RNA using a pan-coronavirus reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assay. most species (21/27) were sampled at more than one location. the viral sequences identified in Kenyan bats showed a remarkable diversity within alpha- and beta-CoVs. we found two lineages of CoV in Rousettus aegyptiacus bats, one of which was present in oral swabs. the other one was identified in fecal swabs. the default tissue tropism for bat CoVs is believed to be intestinal. phylogeny included viral sequences recovered from bats of more than 50 species (30 genera) the newly discovered viruses from Kenya have greatly extended our previous work (15) coVs from two host groups formed sister clades for both alpha- and beta-CoVs. cross-species transmission events resulted in the emergence of severe (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) and mild (HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E) human pathogens, as well as animal pathogens. the correlation values were positive and highly significant in both comparisons (Table 1), suggesting that both host and geography have shaped the structure of virus genetic diversity. however, the virus genetic distance matrices had much higher correlation with host genetic distance matrices than with geographic distance matrices. a mantel correlation index (r) was calculated for each of the distance classes. under the null hypothesis of no relationship between the distance matrices, r values would be close to zero. negative r values suggest larger genetic distances between case pairs. ORF1ab-S-ORF3-E-M-N-ORFx was identified at the 3\u2032 end of the genome in all bat NL63-like and 229E-like viruses characterized in this study. the additional ORF8/ORFX was identified at the 3\u2032 end of the genome in all bat NL63-like and 229E-like viruses characterized in this study. nsp13 nsp16 nsp16 1ab S ORF3/4 E M N HCoV-229E BtKY229E-1 88 98 92 98 97 99 97 96 94 95 75 92 93 90 78 BtKY229E-8 88 97 98 98 98 97 94 96 94 97 90 68 HCoV-NL63 BtKYNL63-9a putative TRS TCTCAACTAAAAAUG UCTCAACUAAAAA(4)AUG TCAACTAAAC(N1)AUG CTCAACTAAAUG TCAACTAAAC(N1)AUG ORF3/4 ORF size (nt) 681 684 684 684 684 Putative TRS TCAACTAAAC(N37)AUG TCAACTAAAC(N37)AUG TCAACTAAAC(N37)AUG TCAACTAAAC( the phylogeny based on the ORF1b protein alignment confirmed that NL63-like and 229E-like groups are monophyletic. the relationship between HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E was also demonstrated by Corman et al. (5) based on specimens obtained in Ghana. phylogeny of the S protein suggests an entirely different evolutionary history for HCoV-NL63 compared to the rest of the genome. HCoV-NL63 was deeply nested within the 229E-like group. in sequence was particularly similar to the BtKY229E-1 and BtKY229E-8 CoVs newly identified during this study. HCoV-NL63 evolved from a recombination event between coVs from the NL63-like and 229E-like groups. a full genome structure, with reference to HCoV-NL63, is shown above the similarity plot. the analysis confirmed the chimeric nature of the HCoV-NL63 genome. a closer inspection of the mantel correlogram suggests the presence of less-structured (homogenous; Mantel statistic r > 0) and highly structured (Mantel statistic r 0) diversity. this corresponds to the division between intragenus (10% 20%) and intergenus (>20%) host genetic distances. HCoV-NL63-like and HCoV-229E-like sequences in bats shed new light on CoV evolution. despite the strong signal for recombination, both putative parental strains show substantial genetic distances from human CoVs. a strong secondary structure between ORF1a and S gene may promote transcriptional pulsing, facilitating recombination (40). but there is also evidence that this recombination hot spot does not exist under nonselective conditions (41), such that it may reflect the successful spread of beneficial recombinants rather than an elevated rate of recombination per se. bat-borne CoVs constitute a substantial part of the diversities of alpha- or beta-CoVs. six lineages of nonbat CoVs are nested within the bat-borne clades. these likely represent independent and successful adaptation via shifts from the progenitor reservoir species (bats) to other mammals. each bat was measured, sexed, and identified to species by a trained field biologist. each fecal and oral swab was suspended in 200 l of a phosphate-buffered saline. RT-PCR products of the expected size (400 nucleotides) were purified by gel extraction. sequences were first aligned in MAFFT v7.013 (46) using amino acid sequences as a guide for the nucleotide sequence alignment. phylogenetic trees were then inferred using the maximum likelihood (ML) method available in PhyML version 3.0 (47), assuming a general time-reversible (GTR) model with a discrete gamma distributed rate variation among sites (4) and the SPR branch-swapping algorithm. 's test and a partial Mantel's test were performed, and the correlation was evaluated with 10,000 permutations. the statistical significance of each regression was evaluated by performing multiple linear regression analyses on these distance matrices. a total of 2,050 bat specimens were collected from 30 different locations in Kenya between 2007 and 2010. each bat was measured, sexed, and identified to species by a trained field biologist. each bat was identified to species by a trained field biologist. ecal and oral swab were suspended in 200 l of a phosphate-buffered saline. PCR products of the expected size (400 nucleotides) were purified by gel extraction. a final 1,104-bp fragment of the cytB gene was amplified and sequenced as described previously. we clustered highly similar sequences from the same geographic location and host species and randomly chose one or two to represent each cluster. this condensed data set was combined with 121 reference sequences representative of the genetic diversity of alpha- and beta-CoVs on a global scale. each class had similar numbers of pairwise comparisons. all statistical analyses were performed using the Ecodist package implemented in R 3.0.2 (51) the data set for each gene was translated into amino acid sequences. phylogenetic trees were then inferred using PhyML. seven sequences were analyzed, including potential recombinant and parental viruses."}
