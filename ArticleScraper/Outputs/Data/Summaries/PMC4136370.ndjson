{"summary": "the 23-kb viral genome is comprised of 11 distinct double-stranded RNA segments (i.e., genes) and codes for 6 structural proteins (VP1 to VP4, VP6 and VP7) and 6 nonstructural proteins (NSP1 to NSP6). reassortment can confer selective advantages on the virus, for example, by increasing its capacity to replicate within the host or allowing it to infect a new host. human RVs are classified as either genogroup 1 or 2 as a result of their overall genotype level gene constellation (GC) (9, 11) genogroup 1 strains exhibit the genotype level GC G2-P[4]/P[6]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A2-N2-T2-E2-H2. in most geographical locations, genogroup 1 strains tend to outnumber both genogroup 2 strains and intergenogroup reassort this specimen collection is unique in that it includes samples from as early as 1974\u2014just a few years after the discovery of RVs\u2014to as late as 1991 (22) so an unprecedented 18-year surveillance time span is captured. we have previously reported on the genome sequencing and analysis of 62 genogroup 1 strains from this collection via a semiautomated reverse transcription (RT)-PCR/Sanger nucleotide-sequencing pipeline at the J. Craig Venter Institute. fecal specimens were tested for evidence of RV using electron microscopy. RNA was extracted from RV-positive samples using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) RNAs from a representative subset of G1P[8]-positive fecal specimens were sent to JCVI (Rockville, MD) for RT-PCR and next-generation nucleotide sequencing. long-range RT-PCR amplicons were generated using the Qiagen One-Step RT-PCR kit. b One sample (DC799) was determined to contain a G3 RV by sequence analysis. pooled amplicons were sheared for 15 min, and compatible barcoded adapters were ligated to the sheared DNA using the Ion Xpress Plus Fragment Library Kit. resulting DNA was amplified by PCR using AmpliTaq Gold (Life Technologies) for 35 cycles. PCR mixtures contained primers corresponding to the known 22-nt barcode sequence. the resulting DNA was then treated with exonuclease I (New England BioLabs) at 37\u00b0C for 60 min, followed by incubation at 72\u00b0C for 15 min. nucleotide sequence alignments and phylogenies were generated with Geneious Pro v5.6.5 (Biomatters) trees were constructed with the nucleotide sequences of >97% of each viral gene. monophyletic groupings were collapsed using FigTree v1.4, and the figures were colorized using Adobe Illustrator CS5. alignments were constructed for each of the 12 RV proteins in Geneious Pro v5.5.2 using the ClustalW plug-in with the BLOSUM cost matrix. alignments were constructed for each of the 12 RV proteins in Geneious Pro v5.5.2 using the ClustalW plug-in. 132 concatenated alignments were exported from Geneious Pro v5.5.2 as individual NEXUS files. only intermolecular connections with mutual information scores of >64.9 were quantitated. to KC580204, KC580092 to KC580102, KC579898 to KC579908, KC580022 to KC580032, KC579820 to KC579830, KC580126 to KC580136, KC579719 to KC579729, KC580374 to KC579729, KC579776 to KC579786, KC580562 to KC580572, KC580011 to KC580021, KC580081 to KC580091, KC580385 to KC580395, KC579570 to KC579580, KC580227 to KC580237, KC579603 to KC579613, KC579850 to KC579860, KC579850 to KC579492, KC579492. RNAs from a representative subset of G1P[8]-positive fecal specimens were sent to JCVI (Rockville, MD) for RT-PCR and nucleotide sequencing. RNAs from a representative subset of G1P[8]-positive fecal specimens were sent to JCVI (Rockville, MD) for RT-PCR and next-generation nucleotide sequencing. the reaction mixtures were incubated in a thermocycler at 45\u00b0C for 30 min, 95\u00b0C for 15 min, and then 50 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 10 s, 55\u00b0C for 3 min, and 68\u00b0C for 10 min. the primer sequences used for RT-PCR are included in the GenBank accession pages. pool was diluted appropriately and amplified on Ion Sphere particles (Life Technologies) during emulsion PCR on the Ion OneTouch 2 system (Life Technologies) the pool was cleaned and enriched for template-positive Ion Sphere particles on the Ion OneTouch ES instrument. the sequence reads from the Ion PGM and Illumina HiSeq were sorted by barcode, trimmed, and assembled using the clc_novo_assemble program (CLC bio) the sequence reads from the Ion PGM and Illumina HiSeq were then mapped to the selected reference segments using the clc_novo_assemble program. trees were constructed with the nucleotide sequences of >97% of each viral gene. monophyletic groupings were collapsed using FigTree v1.4. dN/dS values for each codon were determined using SNAP v.1.1.1. the amino acid sequences of the DC RV proteins from the nonmixed fecal specimens only were concatenated in the order VP7-VP4-VP6-VP2-VP3-NSP1-NSP3-NSP4-NSP5-NSP6 and aligned. the complete concatenated alignments were then trimmed down to protein \u201cpairs\u201d in all 66 possible combinations. mutual information scores were calculated for each amino acid position of the input alignment compared to all other amino acid positions in the alignment. only intermolecular connections with mutual information scores of >64.9 were quantitated. KC579536 to KC579536, KC579909 to KC579919, KC580183 to KC580193, KC579776 to KC579786, KC580562 to KC580572, KC580341 to KC580351, KC579592 to KC579602, KC579614 to KC579624, KC579614 to KC579624, KC579614 to KC580362, KC579470 to KC579480, KC580629 to KC580639, KC580573 to KC580583, KC580573 to KC580573, KC579809 to KC579819, KC579787 to KC579797, KC579809 to KC579707, KC579989 to KC579999, KC580148 to KC580159 fecal specimens were collected from infants and young children who were hospitalized with acute gastroenteritis. total RNA was extracted from RV-positive specimens and classified into preliminary G/P types. 230 representatives were sent to JCVI for RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing (Table 2). all RVs sequenced belong to genogroup 1; no genogroup 2 viruses or intergenogroup reassortants were found. genome sequences now exist for 135 genogroup 1 strains from the fecal-specimen collection (72 G1P[8], 52 G3P[8], and 11 G4P[8] RVs. the VP7 genes of DC1230 and DC1127 formed two distinct branches. G1A VP7 alleles were detected only in DC RVs collected during the years 1974, 1975, 1979, and 1980. the vast majority of mixed fecal specimens contained RVs with G1B VP7 alleles. gene sequences from mixed (M) fecal specimens are indicated. we constructed intragenotypic maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees. the G1A VP7 alleles clustered exclusively within lineage 3, along with the G1 VP7 genes of culture-adapted archival strains. maximum-likelihood intragenotypic phylogenetic trees were constructed using the VP7 gene nucleotide sequences. all horizontal branch lengths are drawn to scale (nucleotide substitutions per base), bootstrap values are shown as percentages for key nodes, and lineages/sublineages are labeled. the VP7 genes of these three DC RVs (DC1563, DC1730, and DC799) had >97.3% nucleotide sequence identity to the G3 VP7 genes of wild-type human RVs isolated over the last 10 years. the two G4 VP7 genes sequenced from mixed fecal specimens were found within lineage 1 (Fig. 2D) intragenotypic diversity of the DC RV VP1-VP4, VP6 and NSP1-NSP5/6 genes of the >135 sequenced DC RVs was determined. the groupings showed interallelic nucleotide identity ranges of 83 to 98% and are color coded in the figures for ease of interpretation and discussion. defined alleles and color yellow, beige, pink, pale pink, purple, light green, light green, light gray, white, or dark gray were exclusively comprised of VP6 genes from the previously sequenced G1P[8] and G4P[8] DC RVs. many of the PDA and NDA groupings were supported by strong bootstrap values (>70%) in the phylogenetic trees made with all available DC RV sequences. nucleotides 49 to 1000 (G); NSP3 gene, nucleotides 35 to 967 (H); NSP4 gene, nucleotides 42 to 569 (I); and NSP5/6 gene, nucleotides 22 to 615 (J). monophyletic lines representing allele groupings were collapsed (triangles) and colored coded. archival DC RVs were located in lineages that were separate from those containing genes of human RVs isolated more recently. however, VP2 and VP6 DC RV alleles, designated by the colors orange and pale pink, exhibited close genetic relationships (>95.5% nucleotide identity) with the genes of contemporary human strains. likelihood intragenotypic phylogenetic trees were constructed for each gene and are outgroup rooted to the genes of strain DS-1. the asterisks indicate animal RV strains, and select RV strains are listed. genogroup 1 DC RVs isolated in any given season could have very different GCs when analyzed at the allele level. only 4 of the 7 G1P[8] viruses sequenced from 1974 showed identical allele level GCs. the isolate DC104 showed an allele level GC similar to those of DC412, DC436, DC484, and DC496. allele level GCs of DC RVs from mixed specimens viewed by year of collection are boxed. the schematic illustrates the color coding of each gene for each sequenced DC RV strain based on the phylogenies shown in Fig. 1 and 3. strains from 1977 (e.g., DC2241), 1989 (e.g., DC3859) and 1991 (e.g., DC5423) had the same alleles for their VP4, VP1, VP2, NSP3 and NSP4 genes. this result suggests certain sets of genes stayed together even in context of reassortant strains. a few alleles for 3 of the DC RV genes were found to encode identical polypeptides. VP6 (cyan versus navy versus pink versus beige), VP2 (orange versus pale pink) and NSP5 (green versus gray versus pale pink versus beige; cyan versus pale pink; yellow versus white) and VP4 (green versus gray versus pale pink versus beige versus pink versus cyan); orange versus white. allelic amino acid conservation and complete interallelic amino acid variations were quantitated. for VP7, the G1A and G1B alleles were also compared to genotype G3 and G4 proteins. gray boxes indicate that no allele-specific changes were identified. each viral protein is represented by a black circle. lines connecting the circles indicate that the two proteins showed intermolecularly covarying amino acid positions with mutual information scores of >64.9. gray boxes indicate no connections were found. the three-dimensional locations of these 15 VP4 amino acid positions were mapped onto the atomic structure of the trypsin-activated protein. none of the covarying residues with codon dN/dS ratios of >1 are in the VP5 stalk region. however, residues 125, 131, 173, and 189 are located in the globular VP8* domain; residue 283 is located at the very tip of the VP5 stalk. 123, 125, 126, 146, 147, 149, 159, 178, 179, 193, 211, 212, 213, 217, 220, 221, 227, 233, 237, 238, 239, 242, 267, 268, 278, 303, 309, 316 VP4 Covarying 35, 78, 104, 108, 121, 125, 131, 131, 131, 131, 144, 228, 239, 532, 559, 570, 653, 775 VP3 Covarying 89, 103, 203, 214, 217, 310, 324, 363, 490, 504, 639, 762, 812, 826 dN/dS > 1 115, 139, 200, 277, 301, 328, 346, 356, 363, 373, 452, 454, 521, 568, 681, 683, fecal specimens were collected from infants and young children who were hospitalized with acute gastroenteritis. total RNA was extracted from RV-positive specimens and classified into preliminary G/P types using a microtiter plate hybridization-based PCR-ELISA. each viral gene was genotyped based upon its nucleotide sequence using the RotaC Web server. of the RVs in the 73 nonmixed specimens, 72 had the genotype level GC G1-P[8]-I1-R1-C1-M1-A1-N1-T1-E1-H1 and 1 (DC799) had the GC G3-P[8]-I1-R1-C1-M1- a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree was constructed to determine the extent of inter- and intragenotypic diversity among the VP7 genes of the sequenced DC RVs. the resultant radial dendrogram showed three major branches corresponding to VP7 genotypes G1, G3 and G4. the VP7 gene of DC799 clustered in the phylogenetic tree with those of G3 strains, suggesting that this specimen was previously mistyped the tree is midpoint rooted and shown in radial format. the tree is shown as percentages for key nodes. four major groupings representing G1 (alleles G1A and G1B), G3 and G4 genotypes are labeled. wild-type archival G1P[8] strains were isolated during the years 1982 to 1990 from Korea (Kor-64) and Italy (PA5/90), as well as with VP7 genes of culture-adapted strains from Argentina (Arg964 and A20) (41\u201343) the G1B VP7 alleles of other DC RVs were found within lineages 1 and 2 and were closely related to the G1 VP7 genes of modern wild-type human RV strains. for 49 of the 51 previously sequenced G3P[8] DC RVs, the VP7 genes clustered within sublineage 3a. two of the previously sequenced G3P[8] DC RVs from 1974 and 1979 (DC1563 and DC1730, respectively) and one newly sequenced G3P[8] DC RV from 1979 (DC799) had VP7 genes that clustered along with modern G3 VP7 genes within lineage 3d. the two G4 VP7 genes sequenced from mixed fecal specimens were found within lineage 1. as such, the DC RV G4 VP7 genes are related (>88.7% nucleotide identity) to those of recently isolated wild-type human strains. together, these results suggest that some of the DC RV G1, G3, and G4 VP7 genes are likely ancestors of the genes of contemporary human strains. phylogenetic analysis of genes from the 51 g3P[8] and 11 g4P[8] DC RVs (25, 26). for example, the red, orange, and cyan allele groupings in Fig. 3A are comprised of VP4 genes from previously sequenced G3P[8] and G4P[8] viruses. however, other newly sequenced DC RV genes did not cluster in the phylogenetic trees with the PDAs maximum-likelihood intragenotypic phylogenetic trees were constructed for each gene and are midpoint rooted. monophyletic lineages representing allele groupings were collapsed (triangles) and colored coded. sequences chosen for this analysis included those of wild-type and culture-adapted human and animal RVs that have either genotype P[8] VP4 genes and/or genotype 1 internal protein genes. most of the VP2 and VP6 alleles from the archival DC RVs were located in lineages that were separate from those containing genes of contemporary human strains isolated more recently. VP1 (red, cyan, green, purple, pale pink, yellow, and orange), VP3 (all colors), NSP2 (all colors), NSP4 (all colors), and NSP5/6 (all colors) maximum-likelihood intragenotypic phylogenetic trees were constructed for each gene and are outgroup rooted to those of strain DS-1. color-coded alleles of each isolate were plotted horizontally. isolates were listed vertically by year of collection. genogroup 1 DC RVs isolated in any given season could have very different GCs. the protein encoded by each viral gene (excluding VP7) is shown at the top. the strain name, its year of isolation, and its G genotype are shown on the left of the corresponding genome. the GC represented by the 1974 strain DC412 was indistinguishable at the allele level from that of DC1292, isolated 7 years later in 1980. the 1979 strains DC222 and DC255 had the same allele level GC as DC5413, which was found 13 years later in 1991. this result suggests that certain sets of genes stayed together even in context of reassortant strains. allele designations of G3P[8] and G4P[8] DC RVs that were redefined based on the results of this study are outlined in thick lines. the numbers of years for which viruses with persistent allele level GCs were found are shown. allele-specific amino acid changes in DC RV proteins are involved in extensive covariance networks. the total length of each protein in amino acids (aa) is shown above the corresponding matrix. the gray boxes indicate that no allele-specific changes were identified. each viral protein showed intermolecular connections with at least one other viral protein. of the 195 total VP4 intermolecular connections, 112 were with VP2. each viral protein is represented by a black circle. lines connecting the circles indicate that the two proteins showed intermolecularly covarying amino acid positions. we analyzed the ratio of nonsynonymous-to-synonymous substitution rates (dN/dS) for each codon of the DC RV genomes. we found that many, but not all, of the covarying amino acid positions were encoded by codons with dN/dS ratios of >1. the three-dimensional locations of these 15 VP4 amino acid positions were mapped onto the atomic structure of the trypsin-activated protein.
