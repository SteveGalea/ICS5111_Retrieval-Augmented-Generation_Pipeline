{"summary": "a protein highly homologous to a secreted bacterial amidase is actually an intracellular regulator of peptidoglycan synthesis (3). predictive algorithms to define the locations of non-protein-coding genes are generally poor. these efforts enable improved functional genetic and biochemical experiments. ncRNAs are being assayed for a range of biochemical activities. they are being used to produce antibodies for cellular studies. ncRNAs represent a particular challenge in bacterial and virus research. we have generated catalogues of the ncRNAs for the organisms (for example, in mycobacteria) (9) that we study and are applying large-scale methods to identify their targets. defining catalogues of ncRNAs provides the community with a road map of targets for downstream studies and analyses. deletion strains in parallel with wild-type control strains under 2,000 defined conditions. differences between strains identify specific medium conditions under which a particular gene is required for wild-type growth. a functional genetic study of mutants harboring deletions of genes of unknown function is informing the development of a new live attenuated Brucella abortus vaccine strain. we seek to identify viral entry proteins that program efficient infections across multiple species. our synthetic approach allows us to rapidly test hypothetical proteins. gene expression has not yet been verified in the context of infection. data we generate will be used by the systems biology centers to further create more complex models of host-pathogen interactions."}
