{"summary": "multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test is used frequently in adult patients with respiratory infections. however, clinical data regarding utilization of multiplex RT-PCR test for RVs are lacking. clinical cases of pneumonia associated with variable RVs have been reported with increasing frequency in adult patients. in the near future, RV detection tests may be considered an essential part of the diagnostic work-up for adult patients with acute respiratory tract infections. however, physicians treating adult patients are not yet familiar with RV detection tests. a nonrespiratory infection (NRI) was defined as neither a URI nor pneumonia. if a patient had an episode of acute infection within 2 days after admission, he or she was considered to have received a test for a community-acquired infection. flu season was defined as between January and April in 2012 and between January and April in 2013. adenovirus, influenza viruses A and B, RSV A, RSV B, parainfluenza viruses 1 to 4, HRV, HMPV, human enterovirus, coronavirus 229E, coronavirus NL63, coronavirus OC43, and human bocavirus. an RV16 test was performed to detect fourteen types of RNA viruses and two types of DNA viruses. an upper respiratory infection (URI) was defined as the presence of 1 of the following respiratory symptoms: cough, sputum production, rhinorrhea, sore throat, dyspnea. a nonrespiratory infection was defined as neither a URI nor pneumonia. the flu season was defined as between January and April in 2012 and between January and April in 2013. RV7 testing was performed using a Seeplex RV7 Detection Kit (Seegene) the products were separated on 2% agarose gels containing 0.5 g of ethidium bromide/mL in Tri-borate-EDTA buffer and were visualized under ultraviolet light. multiplex RT-PCR testing was performed for 291 respiratory samples from 282 adult patients. rapid influenza antigen detection tests were performed for 5,890 nasopharyngeal swab samples and bacterial cultures were performed for 38,195 respiratory samples in the study hospital. RVs were identified in 81 of 291 samples (27.8%), with influenza as the most commonly identified (47/81, 58.0%). influenza (27.4% vs. 14.1%, p = 0.02) and human coronavirus (6.4% vs. 1.2%, p = 0.04) were more frequently detected in patients with a URI than in those with pneumonia. 166 patients with pneumonia (four duplicates excluded) who underwent multiplex RT-PCR testing were compared according to pathogen type. a quarter of these patients had an RV infection (26.5%, 44/166) and a bacterial infection (24.1%, 40/166) RVs were identified in more than a quarter (26.5%) of the 166 patients with pneumonia. nearly half of the patients with RV-associated pneumonia had RVs other than influenza (20/44, 45.4%) multiplex RT-PCR test should be performed to diagnose influenza during the flu season, especially considering the low sensitivity of rapid influenza antigen detection tests. however, the test results are not available on-site, unlike the rapid influenza antigen detection test. a turnaround time of 48 hours was observed in only 25.9% of the positive tests. multiplex RT-PCR testing should not be limited to patients with hospital-acquired respiratory infections of unknown cause. the test may be needed for hospital RV infection control [4]. the causal role of RVs other than influenza has not been determined in adult patients with pneumonia. clinical significance of RVs other than influenza should not be neglected. study suggests RVs other than influenza should be considered in adult patients with pneumonia. the clinical impact of these RVs should be evaluated in future clinical studies. multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test for respiratory viruses was infrequently performed. the utilization of the test was limited for the diagnosis of influenza infection."}
