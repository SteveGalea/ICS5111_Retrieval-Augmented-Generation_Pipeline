{"summary": "DENV occurs throughout the tropics and subtropics and infects approximately 50 million individuals annually. a proportion of infected persons will develop symptoms that include fever, rash and myalgia [1], [2] with 2% or less developing the severe disease syndromes of dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS) [2]. a successful dengue vaccine should induce broadly protective antibodies against all geographic variants of each serotype. a successful dengue vaccine should induce broadly protective antibodies against all geographic variants of each serotype, irrespective of the infecting virus genotype. strain variants using recombinant proteins and whole virus have found that neutralization mAbs raised against one DENV-3 genotype have limited neutralization activity against heterologous genotypes [19]\u2013[22]. a recent WHO report on dengue neutralization testing highlighted the need for evaluating vaccine induced immune responses using contemporary strains representing the different serotypes and genotypes of dengue [25]. the molecular clone should be a valuable tool for studying a variety of other aspects of DENV-3 biology, pathogenesis, immunopathogenesis, epitope mapping and evolution. the clone parent is a 1989 Sri Lankan DENV3 isolate (genotype III) designated UNC3001 (submitted to GenBank) the first fragment, A, was PCR amplified using primer set DEN#1 and DEN2kb. the primers created a T7 RNA promoter at the 5\u2032 end of the fragment and a BsmBI restriction site at its 3\u2032 end respectively. the clone was propagated in three circular and one linear plasmid. rals indicate primer names, approximate location and pair orientation. the E construct is amplified for insertion into the DEN A fragment with primers pUC57 and DEN2kb and for the B fragment with primers DEN2kb+ and EGENE. two amplicons \u2013 3\u2032 and 5\u2032, were generated using primers Dengue15 and Den10198 and primers Den10166 and BsmBIDen respectively. resulting product was digested with SapI and ligated to SapI digested DEN D fragment. final cDNA fragment was gel isolated and cloned into the Big Easy v2.0 Linear cloning vector. primer and primer EGENE (Text S1) and the parent B fragment with primer EGENE+ and DENBGL4 (Text S1) were digested with BsaI and cloned together. cDNA was PCR amplified with primers Dengue01+ and Denv900. plasmid DEN A was sequence verified and used to construct the genotype I recombinant virus. fragments were gel-isolated on 0.8% agarose gel, mixed in equivalent copy number and ligated with T4 ligase overnight at 4\u00b0C. RNA transcripts were mixed with 800 l of the vero cell suspension in an electroporation cuvette. the 175 envelope amino acid sequences were aligned using ClustalX version 1.83 [38] and one representative sequence was selected for each DENV-3 genotype. the representative sequence was chosen based on amino acid conservation within the genotype cluster. primary and secondary Sera Sera were collected from adult volunteers with histories of DENV infection [40] and one anonymous donor with dengue infection confirmed by serology. only genotypes I, II, and III are currently circulating. plates were washed once in PBS and foci developed by the addition of 100 ul of TrueBlue HRP substrate. each dilution was mixed with approximately 30 focus forming units (ffu) of virus to a final volume of 200 ul, incubated for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 and added in triplicate to 24 wells plates. FRNT50 values were calculated by sigmoid dose-response curve fitting with upper and lower limits of 100 and 0 respectively. all error bars show 95% confidence intervals unless otherwise specified. clone parent is a 1989 Sri Lankan DENV3 isolate (genotype III) designated UNC3001 (submitted to GenBank) the dengue genome was amplified from cDNA and cloned as a set of four fragments. the first fragment, A, was PCR amplified using primer set DEN#1 and DEN2kb. the primers created a T7 RNA promoter at the 5\u2032 end of the fragment and a BsmBI restriction site at its 3\u2032 end. s EGENE+ and EGENE used to silently introduce a BsaI recognition sequence into the 5\u2032 end of fragment DEN B. the schematic below illustrates approximate arrangement of E gene domains and restriction sites. ment D was amplified with primers DEN5kb+ and BsmBIDen. two amplicons \u2013 3\u2032 and 5\u2032, were generated using overlapping PCR. resulting product was digested with SapI and ligated to SapI digested DEN D fragment. dengue B plasmids containing the envelope variants were generated by first PCR amplifying the synthetic genes with the Den 2kb+ primer and primer EGENE (Text S1) and the parent B fragment with primer EGENE+ and DENBGL4 (Text S1) these products were then digested with BsaI and ligated together. finally, the ligations were gel purified and cloned into the pCR-XL TOPO clon DEN A with SpeI followed by calf intestine phosphotase (NEB) and BsmBI (NEB) yielding a 2.0 kb fragment; DEN C with BglI yielding a 3.9 kb fragment; and DEN D with BglI yielding a 3.0 kb fragment. full-length transcripts of DENV-3 cDNA constructs were generated in vitro. 7 day supernatants were harvested, supplemented to 30% FBS, clarified by centrifugation and frozen at 80\u00b0C or passaged serially to amplify a working virus stock. 164 unique, full-length DENV-3 envelope genes were available in Genbank. one representative sequence was selected for each DENV-3 genotype. each monolayer was covered in a total volume of 5 ml media. samples were supplemented with 30% FCS, clarified by centrifugation. samples were taken in the same manner every 24-hrs for 6 additional days. plate washed with 2% FBS (Cellgro) and antibiotic mix (Gibco Anti-Anti) plates were incubated 5 days at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2. cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 80% methanol and stored at 80\u00b0C or developed. ructural models of the informative sites were generated using MacPymol (Delano Scientific) and the crystal structure of DENV-3 envelope (PDB 1UZG). mean focus sizes were compared by one-way analysis of variance. orated into cells and recombinant viruses were recovered from first passage vero cell culture supernatant. no nucleotide mutations were detected in the entire genome of the recombinant virus after three passages in vero cells. phylogenetic tree illustrates genetic relatedness of DENV-3 virus genotypes, including those from which representative E genes were synthesized. three of the four variant clones were successfully recovered with correct replacement of the parent clone alone. one variant required the replacement of the parent SL '89 genotype III preM/M gene with a genotype I preM/M gene. one variant, however, required the replacement of the parent SL '89 genotype III preM/M gene with a genotype I preM/M gene. growth kinetics of the panel of recombinant viruses were characterized in mammalian vero cells and C6/36 mosquito cells. both cell lines were infected with the parent and clones at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 FFU/cell and grown for 216 hours. peak viral titers achieved between 120 hours and 168 hours. titers ranged from 6.30 log FFU/ml to 6.66 log FFU/ml. the genotype I Indonesia clone did show slower kinetics than the other clones, particularly early in infection. 8 primary anti-DENV-3 serum samples were tested against the parent and isogenic recombinant viruses with variable E genes from different DENV-3 genotypes. titers for 003 ranged from 159 for Cuba'02 (III) to 1203 for Indonesia '82 (I) (Text S1). serum sample 103 was from a traveler infected with deNV-3 in 1995. FRNT50s ranged from a low 142 (PR '77 (IV)) to a high of 1117 for Thailand '95 (II) we found a 9-fold difference (P0.05) between the lowest and highest neutralizing titers. a low neutralizing group consisting of Indonesia '82 (I), 1133, and PR '77 (IV) 1157. a second, high neutralizing group included the remaining clones Cuba '02 - 1701, Thailand '95 - 11091 and SL '89 -11172. serum 006 (Figure 5B) is from a primary DENV-1 infection; Serum 102 (Figure 5C) is from a primary DENV-4 infection. columns show GMT FRNT50 values calculated from FRNT done in triplicate. each clone is identified on the X-axis. uras, had a similarly scaled FRNT50 range of 112 to 158. but repeat FRNTs were not reproducible for heterotypic sera (Text S1). the parent deNV-3 clone is a genotype III variant isolated from a DF patient in 1989. tree is meant to display DENV-3 diversity but does not include all 175 sequences used to evaluate the genetic variability of the DENV-3 gene. representative sequences from each genotype were selected for inclusion in the tree. a total of 1479 positions were in the final dataset. clones with a genotype I preM/M gene found only one nucleotide mutation in one of the five clones, a silent C to T pyrimidine transition mutation at genomic position 7043 in the genotype I virus. focus formation Because some clinical isolates do not reliably form plaques on vero cell monolayers, viral growth on vero cell monolayers was instead characterized through focus formation. growth kinetics of the panel of recombinant viruses were characterized in mammalian vero cells and C6/36 mosquito cells. both cell lines were infected with the parent and clones at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 FFU/cell and grown for 216 hours. peak viral titers achieved between 120 hours and 168 hours. vero and C6/36 cells were inoculated at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i) of 0.01 FFU. no focus forming units were observed at 0 hrs and for C6/36 cells no focus forming units were observed at 0 hrs and 24 hrs. serotype was previously determined by PRNT against reference WHO strains DENV1 WestPac-74, DENV2 S-16803, DENV3 CH-53489, and DENV4 TVP-360 (Text S1). Location and year refer to where and when the traveler acquired the DENV infection. six of the 15 clone titers in this group less than 160 (Text S1). Figure 4. Mean FRNT50 values for homotypic primary and secondary sera. each clone is identified on the X-axis. '89 -11172 (Text S1) showed a significantly lower neutralization titer at 1304 (Text S1). Against samples 105 (Figure 4F) and 118 (Figure 4G), the neutralization titers differed five (105) and six (118) \u2013fold between recombinant viruses expressing Thailand '95 or PR '77 E glycoprotein (P0.05) (Text S1). each of the five clones were tested against 009, serum from a patient who had a secondary DENV infection, in india or Sri Lanka in 2000. all of the clones were efficiently neutralized at relatively high titers, though the highest (Indonesia '82) and lowest (Cuba '02) did differ significantly. the first full-length infectious DENV clone for DENV-4 isolate 814669 was isolated from a patient in the Dominican Republic in 1981 [49] in 1991 [46]. at that time, the authors noted the full-length DENV cDNA was unstable in E. coli. multiple mutations can be incorporated simultaneously into separate fragments. the parent molecular clone backbone was receptive to heterotypic E sequences. genotype specific prM/M-E interactions between genotype III parent prM/M and genotype I E accounted for failure to recover viable genotype I chimera. chimeric construction may affect interactions between E and non-structural proteins. but these effects are likely subtle, given the relatively similar clone growth kinetics in tissue culture. authors hypothesize differences in neutralization were due to within serotype antigenic differences. researchers tested convalescent sera from 20 DF and DHF cases from the 2001/2002 Cuban DENV-3 epidemic against a panel of six DENV-3 isolates. the sera PRNT50 titers against clinical isolates from before and after that epidemic differed by nearly 10-fold. their observed differences are based on neutralization against wild type viruses representing only genotypes III and IV and only three of the seven viruses used were sequenced. a recent human challenge study in deNV-3 vaccinated subjects found that a PRNT titer 157 in one vaccinated volunteer was only partially protective. another volunteer developed fever and viremia with a pre-existing anti-DENV-3 titer of 116. current vaccine trials define 50% or 60% neutralization titers of >110 [62], [63] or 120 as evidence of immunity, potentially lower than the hypothesized protective thresholds. our findings serve as a point of departure for studying the important epitopes in the human antibody response to DENV infection. Ideally, identifying key neutralizing epitopes in the human polyclonal immune response will inform rational vaccine and possibly therapeutic monoclonal antibody design."}
