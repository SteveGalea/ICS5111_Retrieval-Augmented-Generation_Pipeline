{"summary": "the antiviral response is triggered by the activation of specific signaling cascades leading to transcriptional induction of many antiviral genes. the most important cytokines, in this context, are the type I interferons (IFNs) the most important cytokines are the type I interferons (IFNs) type I IFN-signaling uses IRF-9 for this purpose. the membrane-bound toll-like receptors or the cytoplasmic RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) use IRF-3 or IRF-7 to induce ISGs (7\u201311) this is because ISGs are often induced in virus-infected cells in response to TLR or RLR activation. the first IFIT gene product to be discovered was human IFIT1. it was first identified as a 56-kDa protein whose synthesis was strongly induced by IFN. the corresponding gene, ISG56 (also called IFIT1), was one of the first human ISGs to be cloned (15, 16) the murine Ifit family comprises three characterized members, clustered in a locus on chromosome 13. Ifit1 (Isg56), Ifit2 (Isg54) and Ifit3 (Isg49) are an allelic variant of the Ifit1 gene. IFIT3 and IFIT5 induction caused by low-level production of IFN- has been observed after prolonged treatment with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) in mice, B cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells express abundant Ifit2, but not much Ifit1, whereas T cells express high levels of both. 58, are cytoplasmic and do not possess enzyme activities. they are comprised of multiple copies of the eponymous tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR), a 34-amino-acid helix-turn-helix motif of degenerate sequence. interactions are subunit specific: IFIT1 and IFIT2 bind to eIF3e. Ifit1 and Ifit2 bind to eIF3c subunit. IFIT1 inhibits overall cellular translation in HT1080 cells by 40%. IFIT/RNA INTERACTIONS The RLRs (RIG-I and MDA5) recognize specific structural features of viral RNAs that are absent from cellular RNAs (2, 46) similar molecular patterns are also recognized by the IFIT proteins. human IFITs need to form a complex to efficiently recognize 5\u2032-ppp-RNA. the replication of VSV was restored markedly when the expression of IFIT1 was knocked down individually in those cells. similar findings were made with influenza A virus (Bunyaviridae) the IRES element was located in the middle of the RNA and was unaffected by the 5\u2032-methylation/phosphorylation state of the RNA. ectopic expression of IFIT1 in immortalized human hepatocytes increased after knockdown of IFIT1 mRNA expression (50) another flavivirus shows susceptibility to Ifit2 in cell culture (51) mice revealed novel escape mechanisms used by viruses to evade the antiviral actions of Ifit1. ifit2 protects specific tissues from specific viruses and has no effects on others. many viral mRNAs evade the inhibition by 2\u2032-O-methylation. others use RNA hairpin structures, near their 5\u2032 ends, to prevent the access of Ifit1 to the mRNA caps. wt and Ifit2/ mice are equally susceptible to intracranial injection of VSV. despite IFN induction, VSV replicates in the ipsilateral sciatic nerve of the PNS and then spreads to the CNS neurons of the spinal cord and the brain. SV replicates equally well in the presence or absence of Ifit2 in primary fetal neuronal cultures, in a neuroblastoma cell line, or in mouse embryo fibroblasts (53). pathogenesis by another neurotropic virus, encephalomyocarditis virus, was not enhanced in Ifit2/ mice (53). however, an independently derived Ifit1/ mouse line is reported to be susceptible to 100,000 PFU of VSV (30). wt and Ifit2/ mice are affected by Ifit2 and serum levels of inflammatory cytokine. ifit2 does not inhibit WNV indirectly by promoting IFN- induction. MHV neuropathogenesis is studied using an intracranial injection model. 60% of Ifit2/ mice succumb after showing increased clinical scores. IFNAR/ mice are less susceptible to SeV than Ifit2/ mice. higher pulmonary levels of both SeV and IFN are required for pathogenesis. the replication of a 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase mutant of another flavivirus, Japanese encephalitis virus, is restored in Ifit1/ MEFs and macrophages. a respiratory coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), is largely resistant to Ifit1 in the lungs of wt mice. the mutant virus can replicate well and cause airway pathogenesis (62) mRNA is not capped at all and is masked at its 5\u2032 end with a small viral protein. the most elegant evasion mechanism is used by alphaviruses (63) the alphaviral plus-sense RNA genome and subgenomic mRNAs are all capped. resistance of the wt VEEV lies in the hairpin secondary structure adjacent to the 5\u2032 end of the RNA. Ifit1 binds directly to the mutant RNA's capped 5\u2032 end, thereby inhibiting translation of the mutant mRNA (63). FUTURE PERSPECTIVES Identification of the full repertoire of IFIT-sensitive viruses has only begun. cytoplasmic machinery recaps messages, allowing for translation. many of them also have AU-rich elements (AREs) in their 3\u2032 end, they could be recognized by IFIT2 (29)."}
