{"summary": "multihost pathogens have the potential to cause devastating effects on livestock farmers, national economies and the environment via wildlife die-offs. concerns over multihost pathogens are increasing with compounding effects of land development, globalization and climate change. contact networks are thus conduits for transmission pathways of infectious diseases in populations [7,8]. a transmission network () is often represented as a contact network (K) scaled by a probability. black circles could represent individual animals, or groups of animals such as farms. the contact structure of a population fundamentally depends on behaviour. ly or logistically unfeasible in the real world, estimate epidemiological parameters, link data across scales, explain observed patterns and conduct \u2018what if\u2019 experiments by testing possible disease control measures. conventional SIR models assume that all individuals in a population, or subpopulation, are well mixed and therefore have homogeneous contact structure within that group or compartment. these assumptions overlook important heterogeneities at the population and individual levels. network modelling has been proved to be a useful tool to study transmission of infectious diseases in human populations [7,25\u201327], it has generally been an underused approach for investigating disease dynamics in wildlife and livestock populations. this review article will focus on the use of contact networks to answer questions about infectious disease transmission. pathogens are expected to transmit faster and more extensively in populations that have less social or spatial structure. at the population level, pathogens are expected to transmit faster and more extensively in populations that have less social or spatial structure. jackals live in small family groups unless they have access to ample food sources, in which case they live in larger communities. the cause of variation in these \u2018super\u2019 categories could be owing to a range of factors associated with the individual host, including host genotype, prior exposure to the pathogen (leading to an ability to rapidly produce antibodies), demographic class, behaviour and/or coinfection status. behavioural types also affect interspecific contacts, as seen in badger\u2013cattle interactions where higher-ranked cattle were more likely to have contact with badgers. SNA has been used to identify traits of highly connected individuals. it can also identify traits of highly connected individuals. the heterogeneous network of livestock or poultry movements can also be used. high-resolution data on contacts can be obtained from behavioural studies and new technology [6], including livestock tracking and reporting systems. network modelling is now more feasible for animal systems owing to an ability to collect high-resolution contact data and to integrate the contact data into new theoretical approaches. the number of publications in Scopus per year

makes the design of network models challenging. without contact patterns we are not able to tease apart competing hypotheses about the mechanisms of disease transmission for most systems, and as consequence, are not able to implement targeted intervention and control measures. behavioural researchers often lack data on pathogens with transmission modes and life histories that are relevant to the available contact data. however, in the absence of an observable outbreak, it remains a problem to match this contact data with relevant and appropriate parasites. for wildlife species that are abundant, relatively easy to catch and handle, often the circulating pathogens do not cause morbidity or mortality to the host. if infectious diseases are going to be simulated on social networks, edge construction needs to incorporate parasite life cycles and reflect the type of exposure needed for pathogen transmission. there is the potential to have a mismatch between a contact network and a pathogen for both wildlife and livestock. v) Determine the definition of a node based on the minimum level at which it is important and feasible to collect data on heterogeneous contacts. v) Collect the number of contacts between nodes on a time scale relevant to (likely equivalent to or less than) the infectious period of the pathogen. network modelling has mostly been used to model directly transmitted diseases. individual behaviour, and hence the contact network, can change once an individual is infected. healthy animals could avoid or potentially be attracted to sick animals, and sick animals likely change their interactions with others. data collection for step (vi) of box 1 could occur in a population preferably before, during, and after an outbreak. dynamic networks are tools to incorporate temporal changes in contact network structure. the level of resolution will likely depend on the host, pathogen and system of interest. methods for scaling up empirical networks are being developed. but on a case-by-case basis, we need additional tools to enable us to \u2018scale up\u2019 to populations of relevant sizes. automated proximity loggers and camera traps are not feasible when we lack information on which hosts are involved. the wide choice of potential network structures makes the design of network models challenging. without contact patterns we are not able to tease apart competing hypotheses about the mechanisms of disease transmission for most systems. there are different challenges in applying network modelling to livestock systems. behavioural researchers often lack data on pathogens with transmission modes and life histories that are relevant to the available contact data. behavioural researchers often lack data on pathogens with transmission modes and life histories that are relevant to the available contact data. behavioural researchers often lack data on host infection status in wildlife populations. the method of data collection also affects the construction of the social network. if infectious diseases are going to be simulated, edge construction needs to incorporate parasite life cycles and reflect the type of exposure needed for pathogen transmission. unless animal movements and animal testing are mandated, regional studies of disease spread in agricultural settings are challenging. the network model can then be used for hypothesis testing or \u2018what if\u2019 scenarios. lack of detailed contact data can be hampered by lack of detailed contact data. disease outbreaks in wildlife populations are notoriously difficult to observe and measure. there are different challenges in applying network modelling to livestock systems from those faced by wildlife managers. for livestock and managed fish populations, disease outbreaks can be observed, but detailed data on contacts are often missing. if this is done, the choice of a pathogen to simulate should be made with caution. behavioural researchers often lack data on pathogens with transmission modes and life histories that are relevant to the available contact data. this is a problem because pathogens often infect multiple hosts. researchers often lack information on host infection status in wildlife populations. this situation is especially common when infected individuals cannot be identified without capturing the hosts. a simple thought process could be implemented to avoid a mismatch between a contact network and a pathogen. a simple thought process could be used to combine animal contact data with network modelling. if no outbreak data exist, estimate the transmission rate of the pathogen. contacts to construct infectious disease models or infer contact structure from outbreak data are challenging. a contact would be defined as a susceptible and infectious host being within a specified distance for a specified length of time. the distance and time period are normally unknown for the host species and pathogen strain of interest. animals infected with rabies can either experience \u2018furious\u2019 rabies and likely have more contacts. others exhibit \u2018dumb\u2019 rabies and have fewer contacts. toxoplasmosis can cause behavioural changes in the intermediate host (e.g. cat) to enhance predation by the definitive host (e.g. cat) new technologies, such as proximity contact loggers, have the potential to capture the contacts of an entire population, but they are expensive. new technologies, such as proximity loggers, have the potential to capture the contacts of an entire population, but they are expensive. studies of the dynamics of zoonoses or multihost pathogens at the livestock\u2013wildlife interface are rare. a contact would be defined as a susceptible and infectious host being within a specified

(e.g. cat) to enhance predation by the definitive host (e.g. cat) to complete the parasite's life cycle. the scale likely depends on an interaction between host contacts and infectious period [97], and the relative importance of direct versus indirect transmission [109]. new technologies have the potential to capture the contacts of an entire population, but they are expensive in terms of person-hours. zoonoses or multihost pathogens at the livestock\u2013wildlife interface are rare. a promising area for further research includes increased attention to experiments and manipulations. both hosts and pathogens can be experimentally manipulated through removals or additions. pathogens that are spread via direct contact with conspecifics are useful for evaluating transmission of directly transmitted pathogens in populations. fast mutation rate and short generation time result in unique genetic signatures that can be compared and related across individuals. non-invasive sampling is a preferred method over invasive sampling; non-invasive sampling is especially appealing for collecting pathogens from wild animals. the power of this approach over the use of indicator organisms such as E. coli is the high level of discriminatory power. social relationships likely influence the composition of the gut microbiome. similarity in the gut microbiome could be used to infer social contacts to simulate the spread of pathogens on network models. methods for modelling dynamic networks are being developed [8,148,149] and will need to continue to develop to keep up with the growing size and temporal resolution of the contact data. both hosts and pathogens can be experimentally manipulated through removals or additions, and consequent changes on the contact network can be documented. pathogens that are spread via direct contact with conspecifics are useful for evaluating transmission of directly transmitted pathogens in populations [121] RNA viruses are particularly well suited as markers of host contact, because their fast mutation rate and short generation time result in unique genetic signatures that can be compared and related across individuals. non-invasive sampling is especially appealing for collecting pathogens from wild animals. 16S rRNA marker-based studies provide a new opportunity to obtain and analyse high-depth representations of microbial communities at a low cost. profiling of an entire microbial population has been extensively used in the study of human conditions. it has also been used in livestock to study the effects of management changes on the gastrointestinal microbiome [136,135] new methods for modelling dynamic networks are being developed [8,148,149] and will need to continue to develop to keep up with the growing size and temporal resolution of contact data. new techniques build on the foundation of SNA and traditional SIR modelling, often blending the two methods. the field is wrestling with how best to define a contact, capture contacts between multiple host species and scale up observed networks to biologically relevant sizes. some of these challenges can be solved using new approaches. there is excitement about using new pathogen genetic markers from viruses, bacteria and the gut microbial community to infer transmission networks. contact network models could be used to compare effects of increased sociality on health at a population level, and role of social individuals on an individual level. this material is based on work supported by the Cooperative State Research Service, US
