{"summary": "actin polymerization is an evolutionarily conserved biological process in eukaryotic cells. key elements of cellular actin polymerization machinery include, but are not limited to, actin, nucleation promoting factors (NPFs) and the actin-related protein 2/3 complex (Arp2/3) alphabaculovirus is thus far the smallest pathogen known to profit from the host actin polymerization machinery for their propagation. cellular Arp2/3 is activated by P78/83, a virus-encoded NPF [23], which induces cytoplasmic actin polymerization to propel nucleocapsid migration towards the nucleus. the unique feature of nuclear actin polymerization induced by AcMNPV requires the accumulation of the cytoplasm Arp2/3 subcellular distribution is controlled by CRM1-dependent nuclear export under steady-state and virus-infection conditions. this is the first study describing the nuclear retention mechanism of Arp2/3 under steady-state and virus-infection conditions. we prepared plasmid-based expression constructs encoding P40 tagged with a V5 epitope (P40-V5) at its C-terminus or P40 fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein at its N-terminus (EGFP-P40) to monitor the Arp2/3 dynamics during AcMNPV infection. some nuclear localization was observed for cells infected with AcMNPV carrying an EGFP marker. at 24 hpi, the cells were either mock-infected or infected with vAcegfp (MOI = 2). for immunofluorescence microscopy, the cells were fixed, probed with anti-V5 antibody to detect P40-V5. for the cell fractionation assay, the cells were harvested and separated into nuclear (N) and cytoplasmic (C) fractions. the immunoprecipitated proteins and the WCL were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed with anti-Ha and anti-EGFP. they were either mock infected or infected with vAcegfp (MOI = 2). the cells were fixed at 6, 12 and 24 hpi or harvested for fractionation. EGFP-P40 can be used to monitor Arp2/3 dynamics during AcMNPV infection. tagged with mCherry (mC-Ac34) was shown to accumulate EGFP-P40 or P40-V5 in the nucleus when co-expressed in S1. mCherry or mCherry-tagged Ac34 (mC-Ac34) were transiently co-expressed. at 48 hpt, the cells were subjected to fluorescence microscopy assays. immunofluorescence microscopy at 48 hours post-transfection (hpt) showed that exogenous P40 (P40-V5) resided in the cytoplasm of vAc34KOegfp-transfected cells. the restoration of ac34 to vAc34KOegfp (vAc34KOac34, diagramed in S1B Fig) could accumulate P40-V5 in the nucleus. the aa 195\u2013215 region plays a major role in determining the presence of Ac34 in the nucleus. this phenotype indicated that the aa 195\u2013215 region plays a major role in determining the presence of Ac34.
