{"summary": "both S1/S2 and S2\u2032 sites of MERS-CoV S contain the minimal furin cleavage motif R-X-X-R. no furin cleavage sites were observed at S1/S2 or S2\u2032 for the closely related bat coronavirus-HKU4 (BatCoV-HKU4) furin proteolytic processing was measured for both S1/S2 and S2\u2032 sites of MERS-CoV. furin proteolytic processing was measured for both S1/S2 and S2\u2032 sites of MERS-CoV. mutational and biochemical analyses of full-length MERS-CoV S were undertaken. wt and S2\u2032 mutant MERS-CoV S migrated as a single band at 190 kDa. a lower-molecular-weight form was detected, migrating around 90 kDa. this indicates that furin cleaves S at the S1/S2 site during biosynthesis. decrease in 85-kDa band intensity was much more pronounced in cell lysates compared with MERSpp. results suggest preferential enrichment for incorporation of S1/S2 cleaved S into pseudovirions. concentrated wt and mutant MERSpp were subjected to exogenous furin treatment. a new cleavage product migrating at 65 kDa was observed for the wt and S1/S2 mutant S, but not for the S2\u2032 mutant. furin differentially cleaves S, depending on timing of the proteolytic event, during protein biosynthesis or after viral assembly or egress. human hepatoma-7 (Huh-7) liver cells also showed significantly higher levels of DPP4 expression (18-fold higher than HEK-293T) hepatoma-7 (Huh-7) liver cells also showed significantly higher levels of furin expression. luciferase reporter activity was measured to compare susceptibility to infection. HEK-293T cells were transfected with a furin-encoding plasmid. cells were cotransfected (+) or not () with a furin expression plasmid. for A, B, and C, cells were infected with wt MERSpp. measure of furin mRNA levels shows a knock-down of 62.5%. cells in which furin expression was knocked down were significantly less susceptible to infection than nontargeting siRNA treated cells. overexpression of furin in furin siRNA-treated cells rescued susceptibility to infection. MERS-CoV virions were bound at 4 \u00b0C on permissive MRC-5 cells for 1 h. cells were washed to clear unbound particles and incubated at different points at 37 \u00b0C. cleavage status of S on bound or internalized MERS-CoV was analyzed by Western blot. furin inhibitor was applied to cells before internalization, the 65-kDa band was no longer detected. intensity of the band decreased at 5 M NH4Cl and became undetectable at 20 M. this suggests an important role for low intracellular pH in activating furin to allow cleavage. d to treatment with increasing doses of furin inhibitor. the cells were then infected with MERSpp, and luciferase activity was measured. similar results were obtained with human HEK-293T cells overexpressing DPP4 and Lewis lung carcinoma-porcine kidney-1 cells. mERS-CoV entry appears to be less sensitive to furin inhibition. MRC-5 and WI-38 cells were pretreated for 2 h with dec-RVKR-CMK. the furin inhibitor did not affect influenza virus infection rates. cells were fixed and immunolabeled for MERS-CoV S and stained for nuclei (DAPI) for each condition, 10 objective fields were randomly acquired and analyzed for total number of cells (DAPI nuclei stain) and S-positive cells (infected cells) results are expressed as percentage infected cells, with error bars representing SD from the mean (n = 5). cleavage at S1/S2 may be sufficient for limited cell\u2013cell fusion activity. this has been reported for the S1/S2-specific cleavage of SARS-CoV S by human airway trypsin-like protease that is sufficient for cell\u2013cell fusion, but not virus\u2013cell fusion (20). no furin cleavage sites were observed at S1/S2 or S2\u2032 for the closely related bat coronavirus-HKU4 (BatCoV-HKU4) the sequences were also analyzed using a furin cleavage prediction algorithm (PiTou 2.0) this analysis predicts that both the S1/S2 and S2\u2032 sites of MERS-CoV S can be cleaved by furin. mutational and biochemical analyses of full-length MERS-CoV S were undertaken to confirm furin cleavage predictions. a wild-type (wt) construct encoding MERS-CoV S was synthesized along with mutants (mut), where residues for S1/S2 and S2\u2032 sites were substituted with ones found in BatCoV-HKU4. the proteins were expressed in human embryonic kidney-293T (HEK-293T) cells. wt and S2\u2032 mutant MERS-CoV S migrated as a single faint band comigrating with the 85-kDa fragment of lanes 1. furin cleaves S at the S1/S2 site during protein biosynthesis. a lower-molecular-weight form was detected, migrating around 90 kDa. furin proteolytic processing of wt, S1/S2 mutated, or S2\u2032 mutated S were ultracentrifuged and incubated (2) or not (1) with recombinant human furin. concentration of wt and mutant S incorporation was assessed by analyzing MLV capsid p30 content of concentrated pseudovirions. furin differentially cleaves S, depending on the timing of the proteolytic event. furin can also cleave at S2\u2032 after particle assembly and egress. four cell lines were chosen as target cells for wt S MERSpp infection. HEK-293T, Huh-7, MRC-5, and WI-38 cell susceptibility to MERS-CoV S-mediated entry. hek-293T cells were transfected with empty vector or DPP4 expression plasmid and cotransfected (+) or not () with a furin-encoding plasmid. luciferase activity was measured. empty-vector transfected cells showed a baseline level of infection at 1 104 RLU. infection was significantly enhanced when cells overexpressed DPP4. infection was highest when both DPP4 and furin were overexpressed. NH4Cl or the vacuolar-type H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) proton-pump inhibitor concanamycin A significantly decreased infection. both NH4Cl and concanamycin A conditions significantly decreased infection. overexpression of furin partially restored infection. internalization progresses to 60 and 90 min, a new cleaved product is detected around 65 kDa, similar to the one observed for exogenous furin-treated virions. the 65-kDa cleaved product is somewhat indistinct, very much like the one observed for exogenous furin-treated MERS-CoV virions. unbound virions were washed and cells were either lysed or incubated for various times (10\u201390 min) at 37 \u00b0C to allow internalization of virions. samples were analyzed by Western blot using an anti-S antibody. infected cells were treated with increasing doses of dec-RVKR-CMK. infected cells were labeled using anti-S specific antibodies. a marked decrease in MERS-CoV-positive cells is observed. Huh-7, MRC-5, WI-38, and vero cells were pretreated for 2 h with dec-RVKR-CMK at increasing concentrations. the cells were then infected with wt MERSpp. results are expressed as RLU, with error bars representing SD from the mean (n = 3). furin inhibition severely impaired syncytia formation (5 nuclei/syncytium respectively), indicating an important role for furin in activating S. furin inhibition severely impaired syncytia formation (5 nuclei/syncytium), indicating an important role for furin in activating S. cleavage activation activates the fusogenic potential of viral envelope glycoproteins. it can be proteolytically processed by furin at two distinct sites. furin-mediated dual activation adds to the growing list of activation mechanisms. furin is an important factor that may modulate susceptibility to MERS-CoV infection, along with its receptor DPP4. this is consistent with the view that together with the receptor, the host-cell proteolytic environment can play a major role in sensitizing cells to MERS-CoV infection. cleavage at S2\u2032 went from 40.1% to 54.1% relative band intensity. lowering the pH to 6 did not enhance proteolytic processing. s-DPP4 modestly enhances furin-mediated S2\u2032 cleavage. this suggests that the cleavage event promotes the one at S2\u2032. the furin cleaved product band in the mutated S is weaker than in the wt S. similar results were obtained in this study. furin was not inhibited at the concentrations used by Shirato and colleagues in vivo (29) this interpretation offers a possible explanation to why MERS-CoV infectivity was retained using this drug. a possible approach would be to formulate a drug combination that targets cathepsins and lung-specific proteases. cells were cultured at 37 \u00b0C 5% CO2 in DMEM supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) FCS, 10 mM Hepes, 100 IU/mL penicillin and 100 g/mL streptomycin. NHBE cells were cultured in bronchial epithelial growth medium (Lonza) the virus was propagated in a biosafety level 3 facility in Vero cells. titration was performed using 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) assay.
