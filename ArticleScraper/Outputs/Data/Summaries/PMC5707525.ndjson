{"summary": "genetically modified viruses (GMVs) are considered highly desirable for vaccinations against diseases that are difficult to treat or for which there exists no effective conventional vaccine. some of the advantages of GMVs in vaccination are the enhancement of immunogenicity without an adjuvant. vectors derived from SeV show high efficiency in gene transfer and transduce both dividing and non-dividing cells efficiently and can therefore be administered intranasally. this reduces the influence of pre-existing immunity compared to intramuscular administration. the aim of the ERA is to assess the risk to humans and the environment of products derived from genetic modification and to proffer management and mitigation strategies. hazards and potential risks to the environment of GMVs are linked to shedding, survivability, the nature and toxicity of transgenes, the dissemination and transfer of novel/foreign genes to wild-type viruses. smallpox was estimated to be responsible for 300\u2013500 million deaths worldwide in the 20th century alone. the successful eradication of smallpox was possible due to early recognition and diagnosis of the disease. the successful eradication of smallpox was possible due to early recognition and diagnosis of the disease, quarantine of patients, effective vaccination and the fact that VARV infects only humans. multiplication incompetent poxvirus vectors have been developed as a safer alternative to multiplication competent vectors. these include MVA, attenuated VACV Copenhagen (NYVAC) and attenuated derivatives of fowlpox virus (TROVAC) and canarypox virus (ALVAC) these multiplication deficient poxvirus vectors form the backbone of most poxvirus-vectored vaccines. risk characterization of the vector is either regarded as irrelevant or has been unequivocally addressed in scientific literature [42]. the aim of this review is to identify gaps in knowledge with respect to hazard characterization of MVA vector/MVA-vectored vaccines and highlight ongoing and future experiments. this will contribute to a more robust ERA of MVA vector/MVA-vectored vaccines. many viruses have been used as GMVs for vaccination purposes. the major ones are Poxviridae (Vaccinia virus; VACV), Retroviridae (including lentivirus), Adenoviridae (human Adenovirus; hAdV), Parvoviridae (Adeno-associated virus; AAV), Herpesviridae (cytomegalovirus; CMV) and Paramyxoviridae (sendai virus; retrovirus and AAV vectors provide long-term gene expression. but their package size is limited to 4.5 and 7.5 kilobases respectively. retroviruses are associated with various diseases, e.g., leukemia, lymphoma and AIDS. smallpox, a highly lethal disease caused by variola virus, was declared extinct. some protection from smallpox was achieved by transferring material from scabs taken from smallpox patients to uninfected individuals. smallpox is believed to have emerged around 10,000 BC but the origin of VARV is unknown. the successful eradication of smallpox was possible due to early recognition and diagnosis of the disease, quarantine of patients, effective vaccination and the fact that VARV infects only humans and has no animal host reservoir. recombinant vaccines based on poxvirus are good candidates for prophylactic and therapeutic vaccination of humans and animals. s have been developed as a safer alternative to multiplication competent vectors. these include MVA, attenuated VACV Copenhagen (NYVAC) and attenuated derivatives of fowlpox virus (TROVAC) and canarypox virus (ALVAC) these multiplication deficient poxvirus vectors form the backbone of most poxvirus-vectored vaccines. the aim of this review is to identify gaps in knowledge with respect to hazard characterization of MVA vector/MVA-vectored vaccines and highlight ongoing and future experiments. this will contribute to a more robust ERA of MVA vector/MVA-vectored vaccines. a complete replication cycle of MVA is restricted to avian cells. in human and other mammalian cells, the virus replicates its DNA. it has unimpaired expression of early and intermediate genes as well as most late genes. however, the virus is still able to express viral genes. the vaccine was licensed in 1977 and was administered to over 120,000 people. the development and optimization of MVA as a smallpox vaccine continued post smallpox eradication. this in part is driven by the concern that the smallpox virus may re-emerge due to accidental escape from containment or due to bioterrorism. MVA-1721 infects some human cell lines while MVA-BN undergoes abortive infection in mammalian cell lines. even in some non-permissive cells as determined by fold increase in virus titer [50], there is limited production of mature MVA virions [52]. small intestine NP [52] A549 Human; lung SP [52] HaCaT Human; skin NP SP [51] LC5 Human; lung NP [51] 85 HG 66 Human; brain NP [51] U138 Human; blood (T-cell NP [51] HUT 78 Human; blood (B-cell NP [51] MIB Monkey; blood (B-cell NP [51] BSC-1 Monkey African Green; kidney SP, P the attenuation of MVA in vivo depends on the strain or variant. most MVA strains produce abortive infection in intact animal hosts. some variants were virulent to immune-deficient mice [56] MVA is optimized for improved vaccine efficacy by deleting the few intact VACV immunomodulatory genes [87,88,89], insertion of genes that encode co-stimulatory molecules [90,91] and more precise regulation of gene expression from endogenous or synthetic promoters [92,93,94]. studies aimed at further attenuation of the MVA vector are miniscule probably due to the assumption that the development of MVA has reached a satisfactory level of safety. keywords dealing with the efficacy or immunogenicity of MVA returned higher numbers of published articles (223 to 478) whereas keywords dealing with biosafety or ERA returned very few hits (3 to 16) safety studies are not biosafety or environmental risk studies. a complete replication cycle of the virus is restricted to avian cells. in human and other mammalian cells, the virus replicates its DNA. it has unimpaired expression of early and intermediate genes as well as most late genes. however, the virus is still able to express viral genes. of 7098 vaccinees, 2.3% developed fever (i.e., >38 \u00b0C) and 4.1% developed non-specific general symptoms. the MVA vaccine was licensed in Germany in 1977 and was administered to over 120,000 persons. however, these vaccinations were conducted when smallpox was no longer endemic in Germany. there is a significant variability in the susceptibility of mammalian cell lines to mammalian cell lines (Table 1).

depends on the strain or variant. most MVA strains produce abortive infection in intact animal hosts. some variants were virulent to immune-deficient mice. recombinant vaccines against a plethora of other human diseases are in pre-clinical trials [26,34,77]. recombinant vaccines against cancers are in pre-clinical and clinical development [78,79,80,81]. recombinant vaccines against domesticated animals and wildlife are in pre-clinical and clinical development [82,83,84,85,86]. each pre-fixed or suffixed object was searched independently. each pre-fixed or suffixed object was searched independently. 866 and 800 articles respectively were retrieved. the molecular basis for the non-productive infection of human and other mammalian cells by MVA remains unknown. this creates a major knowledge gap in the hazard characterization of MVA. the absence of host range genes and the presence of six major deletions in the MVA genome may be responsible for the severe host cell defect. the role of insertions/deletions (indels) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in MVA non-productive infection of human cells remains uninvestigated. there is also no attempt to re-adapt MVA to multiply in human cells. future work will extend these experiments with MVA-VR1508 to MVA-BN. results from these studies will shed light to the host restriction defect of MVA in human cells. the identical genome sequence of independent MVA strains from at least five independent laboratories is presented as evidence of MVA clonal purity and genome stability. the next generation sequencing approach used in sequencing those genomes only reported the genome of the predominant MVA clone or variant, since it was not designed to determine if minor variants are present. isolation and genome wide mapping of variants within the MVA stock or MSV have never been reported. emergence of quasi-species and their role in the modulation of the MVA phenotype is an omitted research field that needs to be addressed. emergence of quasi-species and their role in the modulation of the MVA phenotype including host range, infectivity, attenuation, virulence and biodistribution is an omitted research field. studies on viral and host factors that modulate transgene stability are miniscule. the effect of transgene insertion site [105,106,107,108], promoter choice [104], promoter spacer length [109], timing of transgene expression [104], sequence/structure of the transgene/flanking region [111] and host cell used for virus amplification [96] are poorly understood. data on the occurrence and characteristics of wild-type OPVs in remaining regions of the globe are limited or non-existent. no scientifically valid inference can be made on the potential of virus-virus interactions between genetically modified poxvirus vaccines and naturally circulating OPVs. the absence of data on naturally circulating OPVs is a significant knowledge gap in the ERA of MVA-vectored vaccines. recombination between poxvirus-vectored vaccines and naturally circulating OPVs during co-infection and superinfection of cells/hosts is significant. the ERA of MVA-vectored vaccine does not evaluate the potential for recombination between the recombinant MVA vaccine and wild-type OPVs. the risk of recombination is said to be negligible because MVA does not produce infectious virions in human and most other cells of mammalian origin. 0.5% of the visual plaques in co-infected cells and 0.4% to 7.1% of plaques in superinfected cells expressed the transgene. both the transgene expressing MVA/fCPXV recombinants displayed different plaque phenotypes. cells were co-infected with the parental viruses at a m.o.i. of 5.0 for each virus. cells were harvested three days post infection, freeze-thawed and sonicated. a rare recombination event may generate progeny hybrid viruses that are more virulent than any of the parental strains. a rare recombination event may generate progeny hybrid viruses that are more virulent than any of the parental strains. biodistribution, shedding and persistence of genetically modified and/or transgenes to ERA is critical in ERA. biodistribution The virus/vector/transgene can potentially be dispersed throughout the body when administered via a route other than the alimentary canal. this has potential of transmission to sex cells (with the attendant risk of transmission to offspring) biological properties of the virus vector/virus-vectored vaccine are important considerations. biodistribution, immunocompetence, dose and route of administration, sampling frequency and duration of sampling, methods for sample analysis and data interpretation are important considerations. multiplication competence of the virus vector is an important consideration in assessing shedding. there is dearth of information on persistence of virus-vectored vaccine. there is dearth of information on persistence of GM viruses/vectors. this ignores the fact that genetic manipulation may have affected some biological properties of the GM virus/vector resulting in a persistence that is different from that of the corresponding parental virus. interactions between GM virus vector and resident natural viruses could generate quasi virus species that are unstable and constantly mutate. altered epitope can result in less efficient immune clearance due to weak binding to receptors on the immune cells. administration of MVA in animal models leads to induction of type I and type II interferons (IFNs), pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. despite mutations and major deletions, the MVA genome still encodes several proteins with immunomodulatory functions. high doses of GM-CSF expressed by MVA/GM-CSF inhibited mucosal antibody response and diminished protection elicited by MVA/Simian Immunodeficiency virus (SIV) macaque\u2019s vaccine. reintroducing VACV genes in MVA to modify the immune response to MVA warrant caution as illustrated by the study of Backes and co-workers. insertion of genes encoding co-stimulatory molecules (e.g., interleukins, IFN), increased expression of the foreign antigen (e.g., promoter strength, codon optimization, terminal signal peptide) and adjuvant (e.g., Glucopyranosyl Lipid A, MF59) modulating the expression of MVA genes in these manners can improve the immunogenicity of MVA vaccines and activate immune responses to heterologous antigen f from HIV-1 subtype C induced IFN-producing CD8+ T cells. the number of these T cells was higher upon infection with a mutant lacking the F1L gene. evidence has to be provided to show that the molecules do not predominantly result in a Th2 response. ERK1/2 activation in HEK293 cells depended on intact O1L gene. infection of DUSP1 knockout mice with MVA increased the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines indicating that DUSP1 is involved in the regulation of innate and adaptive immune responses during poxvirus infection. the molecular basis for the non-productive infection of human cells by MVA remains unknown. this creates a major knowledge gap in the hazard characterization of MVA. the absence of host range genes and the presence of six major deletions in the MVA genome may be responsible for the severe host cell defect. we hypothesized that MVA can be re-adapted to multiply in human cells by multiple serial passaging in human cell lines. we infected non-permissive human Caco-2 cells with MVA (ATCC VR-1508) at a low multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 0.01. we were able to show 2 to 3 log fold increase in virus titer from p28 to p40. infected cells were harvested, freeze-thawed three times and the virus titer was determined. no mature virions were observed from cells infected with non-passaged MVA. a robust hazard characterization of a virus vector will demonstrate that the vector is clonally pure and genetically stable. a study employing passage of MVA strains in immune-deficient mice has shown that the examined MVA strains with the exception of MVA-BN are polyclonal [56] but the observation from that study shows that MVA-BN is homogenous can only be confirmed if MVA-BN is subjected to deep sequencing. instability may occur within the transgene expression cassette (transgene instability) or outside the expression cassette (genome instability) provision of genome sequences of MSV for up to five passages is not mandatory under Directive 2001/18/EC. the genome stability of all MVA-vectored vaccines intended for clinical application remains unknown. there is no report where transgene instability and the underlying mechanisms have been investigated in vivo. there is no report where transgene instability and the mechanisms have been investigated in vivo. this is particularly relevant in immuno-compromised infection models. no scientifically valid inference can be made on the potential of virus-virus interactions between recombinant vaccines and naturally occurring virus relatives in these regions. recombinant vaccines against malaria [136,137], HIV/AIDS [138], tuberculosis [68], MERS-CoV [83], Ebola [73] and several other human and animal diseases [26,86] are in trials in africa, Asia and Middle East. recombination between recombinant poxvirus and naturally circulating OPVs is significant in terms of ERA of MVA-vectored vaccines. this is because recombination has the potential of restoring productive infection of a multiplication-incompetent vaccine-vector as well as generating hybrid viruses with altered host range, cell tropism, transmissibility and virulence. studies aimed at investigating recombination between recombin recombination between recombinant MVA vaccines and wild type OPVs is deemed unlikely. recombination between recombinant MVA and wild type OPVs during co-infection and superinfection cannot be excluded. 0.5% of the visual plaques in co-infected cells expressed the transgene. co-infection and superinfection were done at a m.o.i. of 5.0 for each virus. cell suspension was used to inoculate fresh monolayer of vero cells. recombinant MVA vaccine can recombine with naturally circulating OPVs during co-infection and superinfection of mammalian cells that are semi-permissive to MVA. recombinant MVA vaccine can recombine with naturally circulating OPVs during co-infection. naturally occurring OPVs like CPXV, MPXV or VACV may become more virulent if they acquire the transgene encoding co-stimulatory molecules from an MVA-vectored vaccine. recombination between attenuated infectious laryngotracheitis virus vaccine strains resulted in the emergence of virulent field isolates. biodistribution, shedding and persistence of GMVs A vaccine virus/vector will be biodistribution will be affected especially for multiplication competent GMVs. this information is relevant for mapping the dissemination of the recombinant vector. biodistribution may influence the time window and routes of shedding of the virus from the recipient and thus, the likelihood of transmission to third parties. the ERA of multiplication competent virus vectors is based on the assumption that there is a likelihood of spread of the viral vector from the vaccinee into the environment. shedding of the virus is unlikely but evidence should be provided that in such a case, the protein(s) encoded by the inserted transgene(s) has not altered the multiplication incompetence of the vector. different materials of wild-type viruses commonly employed as vectors are available [163]. this ignores the fact that genetic manipulation may have affected some biological properties of the GM virus/vector resulting in a persistence that is different from that of the corresponding parental virus. an example is where inserted sequences can influence the genome stability of the viral vector. multiplication competence of the virus vector is an important consideration in assessing shedding. biodistribution, the status of the host including immunocompetence, dose and route of administration, sampling frequency and duration of sampling are important considerations. multiplication competence of the virus vector is an important consideration in assessing shedding. poxviruses show high environmental stability, resistance to drying and may remain contagious over a period of several months in ambient temperature [158,159], they are nevertheless sensitive and easily inactivated by all disinfectants commonly approved for surface disinfection [160,161,162]. persistence of viral particles and DNA in the environment can be affected by several factors (reviewed in [163]. there is dearth of information on persistence of virus-vectored vaccine such as recombinant MVA clearance should be effective given that a good proportion of the population already have pre-existing immunity to VACV/MVA. interactions between GM virus vector and resident natural viruses could generate quasi virus species that are unstable and constantly mutate. this could lead to species with altered epitopes and thus less infectivity. VACV infection in mice and humans induces humoral- (antibody secreting B cells or plasma cells) and cell-mediated (CD4+ and CD8+ T cell) responses. despite mutations and major deletions, the genome still encodes several proteins with immunomodulatory functions. ant MVA expressing granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating growth factor may trigger an increased immune response. however, high doses of GM-CSF expressed by MVA/GM-CSF inhibited mucosal antibody response and diminished protection elicited by MVA/Simian Immunodeficiency virus. strategies used to improve immunogenicity of (recombinant) MVA include immunization with prime/boost with other viruses or DNA vectors, insertion of genes encoding co-stimulatory molecules (e.g., interleukins, IFN), increased expression of the foreign antigen (e.g., promoter strength, codon optimization, terminal signal peptide) and adjuvant. MVA-C, a MVA vector, expressed the envelope protein and the Gag-Pol-Nef. the number of these T cells was higher upon infection with a mutant lacking the F1L gene. evidence has to be provided to show that the molecules do not predominantly result in a Th2 response. the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activates ERK1/2 in HEK293T cells. this is in contrast to the findings by Schweneker et al. [188] who showed that CVA induced sustained ERK 1/2 activation in HEK293T cells but MVA failed to do so. VACV infection in mice and humans induces humoral- (antibody secreting B cells or plasma cells) and cell-mediated (CD4+ and CD8+ T cell) responses. despite major deletions, the MVA genome still encodes several proteins with immunomodulatory functions. recombinant MVA vectors expressing host genes encoding immune stimulating proteins may trigger an increased immune response. however, high doses of GM-CSF expressed by MVA/GM-CSF inhibited mucosal antibody response. reinsertion of the K1L gene restored eIF2 phosphorylation. Vaccination with VACV strains that can multiply in patients with glycosylation defects may result in poorer immune response and poorer protection against poxvirus infection. strategies used to improve immunogenicity of (recombinant) MVA include immunization with prime/boost with other viruses or DNA vectors. IFN-, TNF- and IL-2 secreting E3-specific CD8+ T-cells was observed 8 weeks after vaccination with MVA lacking B15R compared to MVA. the number of these T cells was higher upon infection with a mutant lacking the F1L gene [182]. it is not known whether MVA leads to Akt activation. another pathway that is modulated upon MVA infection is the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. there is insufficient knowledge and data on some aspects of MVA biology that are relevant to hazard characterization. the ERA of MVA-vectored vaccines does not incorporate methodological identification of uncertainty and uncertainty analysis. in risk and crisis communication, it is considered a best practice to emphasize and acknowledge uncertainty [196] testing for worst-case scenarios that are falsifiable will reduce uncertainty. assumptions of worst-case scenarios such as recombination with wild-type OPVs and emergence of more virulent hybrid progenies should be falsified or rejected through experimental investigation. the ERA of MVA-vectored vaccines does not incorporate methodological identification of uncertainty and uncertainty analysis [194], implying that uncertainty is low or negligible. uncertainty analysis using different typologies have already been developed for genetically modified (GM) plants, chemical pollutants and nanoparticles. a risk analysis where the worst-case scenario is shown not to occur is evidence that the risk of adverse effect is low. assumptions of worst-case scenarios such as recombination with wild-type OPVs and emergence of more virulent hybrid progenies should be falsified or rejected through experimental investigation."}
