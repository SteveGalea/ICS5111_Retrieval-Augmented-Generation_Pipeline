{"summary": "morpholino oligos, also known as phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers, have demonstrated promising effectiveness in developmental biology research involving gene knockdown as well as clinical trials focusing on treatments of genetic disorders. morpholino oligos are short single-stranded DNA analogs that contain a backbone of morpholine rings connected by phosphorodiamidate linkages. EXONDYS 51TM (Eteplirsen) is a hallmark of PMO-based antisense therapy. it demonstrates the potential safety and effectiveness of PMO technology. PMO therapies have also been evaluated as treatments for other diseases. first antisense ON tested in clinical trials beginning in 1993 was designed to target p53 for treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia. the first antisense drug (Fomivirsen) was approved by the FDA in 1998 for treatment of cytomegalovirus retinitis in immunodeficient patients. RNase-H-independent steric blockage of antisense ON may be a safer strategy. the effective target region of the steric blocking agent ON for inhibiting translation is generally limited to the 5\u2032-UTR (untranslated region) and start codon regions of mRNA. phosphorothioate backbone of morpholine rings connected by phosphorodiamidate linkages. phosphodiester intersubunit bonds replaced with phosphorodiamidate linkages. antisense PMOs have been revolutionary tool in developmental biology. in vitro delivery of unmodified PMO is greatly limited by inefficient in vivo delivery unless a relatively high doses are administrated. in the animal model, high doses of unmodified PMO injection in dystrophic muscle were needed to induce functional dystrophin expression in skeletal muscle. cell penetrating peptide was originally identified after discovery of an unexpected property of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) trans-activator of Transcription (Tat) protein. the novel activity was revealed by observations that Tat could transactivate a HIV-1 LTR promoter after crossing cellular and nuclear membranes. this novel peptide sequence was then evaluated for its ability to confer membrane-crossing abilities to other proteins and compounds, including PMO. the most efficient CPP in this study was (R-Ahx-R)4R, in which Ahx represents a 6-aminohexanoic acid spacer (Moulton et al., 2007), and in treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. this obstacle has limited their use in clinical settings. compared with CPP-conjugated PMO, Vivo-PMO have been less frequently investigated for inhibitory effects against target genes. however, available data suggest that at least a 50% knockdown of target genes can be achieved using Vivo-PMO, with no adverse side effects both in vitro and in vivo. studies have demonstrated this type of PMO is well tolerated and exhibits improved efficacy in numerous in vivo viral infection models relative to other PMO therapies. however, reports available to date suggest that PMOplus may be less cytotoxic than CPP-PMO. peptide-conjugated PMO (PPMO) and non-conjugated PMOs have been tested against Ebola virus infection in cultured cells and animal models. a corresponding non-conjugated PMO also provided complete protection of mice when administered prophylactically as well as a lethal dose of EBOV. combination of EBOV-specific PMOs targeting viral mRNAs for VP24, VP35, and RNA polymerase L protected rodents against EBOV challenge when administered before and after exposure. in the same study, non-conjugated PMO were also tested in a prophylactic proof-of-principal trial in rhesus macaques. picornaviruses are non-enveloped positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses belong to the family Picornaviridae. many picornaviruses are important human and animal pathogens, including poliovirus, coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), enterovirus 71 (EV-71) and foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) no effective antiviral therapy yet exists for picornaviruses other than for PPMO-6 was particularly potent against CVB3 replication in cultured cells. PPMO-6 was designed to target the 3\u2032 portion of the CVB3 IRES. in mice, PPMO-6 intravenous administration once prior to and once after CVB3 infection significantly reduced cardiac tissue damage. three of the PPMOs targeted domains including the 5\u2032 portion of the IRES and the two translational start codon-containing regions were highly effective in inhibiting FMDV replication. at low micromolar concentrations, PPMO led to a dose-dependent and sequence-specific virus titer reduction of over 5 log10. three other PPMO that targeted other genome regions were less effective. PPMO 5TERM targeted the 5\u2032 terminus of the RNA genome. in mice, 5TERM PPMO treatment led to prevention of tissue damage. PPMO also decreased MHV-induced weight loss and prolonged post-challenge survival. PPMO targeting the 5\u2032 UTR were highly effective for inhibiting PRRSV replication in cell culture. PPMO 5UP2 or 5HP caused a 4.5 log10 reduction of PRRSV yield. PPMO 5UP2 or 5HP also demonstrated broad inhibition of heterogeneous PRRSV isolates. antiviral effects of PMO were also evaluated against equine arteritis virus (EAV), another member of the family Arteriviridae. PPMO targeting the 5\u2032 terminal UTR of the EAV genome remarkably reduced virus replication in a sequence-specific and dose-responsive manner. however, PPMO targeting the 5\u2032 terminal UTR of EAV were ineffective to achieve transcription interference. PPMO 5\u2032End or 3\u2032CSI inhibited WNV replication. PPMO 3\u2032CSI also inhibited other flaviviruses. PPMO targeting conserved cis-acting elements of flavivirus genomes should be explored as anti-flavivirus therapeutics. treatment with 10 M 3\u2032CS inhibited replication of all four DEN virus serotypes by over 4 log10, in most cases to below detectable limits. 5\u2032SL inhibited viral translation and 3\u2032CS blocked viral RNA synthesis but not viral translation. 3\u2032SLT inhibited both viral translation and RNA synthesis. of JEV exhibited significant antiviral activity in vero (epithelial), neuro2A (neuronal) and J774E (macrophage) cells at non-toxic concentrations. addition of P10882 to cells before infection decreased JEV replication to undetectable levels in vero cells. antiviral effects of P10882 were also assessed in vivo. administration of 15 g/g CPMO1 before infection conferred 100% survival against CHIKV disease. PPMO have also been tested for antiviral effects toward group V (-)ssRNA virus families that include Pneumoviridae, paramyxoviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Arenaviridae. PPMO inhibited replication of equine influenza A virus FLUAV A/Eq/Miami/1/63 (H3N8) in mice and exhibited no toxicity at effective antiviral concentrations in vivo. PPMO have also been tested for efficacy against host mRNA encoding proteases crucial for viral infectivity. PPMO was shown to prevent cleavage of HAs of various human seasonal and pandemic influenza A viruses, leading to significant reduction of viral titers by 2 to 3 log10. Junn virus, a threat to human health and a member of the Arenaviridae family, can cause meningitis and hemorrhagic fever. PPMO targeting the first AUG region of the ORF1 near the 5\u2032-end of the murine norovirus (MNV) genome effectively inhibited MNV replication in cultured cells. hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus containing three ORFs. PPMO targeting the 3\u2032 UTR of the HEV genome or the 5\u2032 terminus of antisense HEV RNA can also block HEV replication. PPMO targeting the 5\u2032 terminus of antisense HEV RNA can also block HEV replication, but to a lesser extent than achieved by PPMO targeting the 5\u2032 terminus. a combination of EBOV-specific PMOs targeting viral mRNAs for VP24, VP35, and RNA polymerase L protected rodents against EBOV challenge when administered before and after exposure. a corresponding non-conjugated PMO also provided complete protection of mice when administered prophylactically as well. monkeys against lethal EBOV infection, whereas PMOplus AVI-7539, targeting VP35 alone, failed to do so. VP24 may be a key EBOV virulence factor and may serve as a promising target for further development of effective anti-EBOV treatment strategies. PPMO targeting conserved internal ribosome entry site sequences have been shown to be highly effective in protecting cultured cells against infection. coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) is a primary cause of viral myocarditis. PPMO-6, designed to target the 3\u2032 portion of the CVB3 IRES, was especially potent against CVB3 replication in cultured cells. PPMO-6 intravenous administration once prior to and once after CVB3 infection significantly reduced cardiac tissue damage. six PPMOs were designed to target 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs of the FMDV genome. three of the PPMOs targeted domains including the 5\u2032 portion of the IRES and the two translational start codon-containing regions. PPMO led to a dose-dependent and sequence-specific virus titer reduction of over 5 log10. PPMO targeting the MHV replicase exhibited low toxicity in DBT astrocytoma cells. PPMO 5TERM targeted the 5\u2032 terminus of the RNA genome. PPMO also decreased MHV-induced weight loss and prolonged post-challenge survival. PPMOs targeting the 5\u2032 end UTR of the PRRSV genome were highly effective for inhibiting PRRSV replication in cell culture in a dose-dependent and sequence-specific manner. PPMO 5UP2 or 5HP caused a 4.5 log10 reduction of PRRSV yield. PPMO treatment was well tolerated in piglets, with no weight change observed. PPMO administration significantly reduced PRRSV viremia and interstitial pneumonia. antiviral effects of PMO were also evaluated against equine arteritis virus (eAV), another member of the family Arteriviridae. PPMO targeting the 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-termini of the WNV genome, designated 5\u2032End or 3\u2032CSI, exhibited the greatest potency in blocking WNV replication. treatment of WNV-infected cells with either 5\u2032End or 3\u2032CSI PMO led to a significant reduction of virus titers by approximately 5\u20136 log10 without apparent cytotoxicity. the most highly effective PPMO were 5\u2032SL and 3\u2032CS. treatment with 10 M 3\u2032CS inhibited replication of all four DEN virus serotypes by over 4 log10, in most cases to below detectable limits. PPMO and PPMO have been studied for their ability to prevent or treat japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection. PPMO (P10882) targeting the 3\u2032 cyclization sequence (3\u2032CSI) of JEV showed significant antiviral activity in Vero (epithelial), Neuro2A (neuronal) and J774E (macrophage) cells at non-toxic concentrations. two PPMOs were designed to target highly conserved sequences present in CHIKV non-structural and structural polyproteins. CPMO1, a PPMO that targets the ORF1 AUG region, significantly suppressed CHIKV replication in HeLa cells when administered before infection. PPMO 454, targeting conserved sequence in translation start site of mRNA coding for viral nucleocapsid protein, was highly effective against multiple genotypes of MeV. PPMO inhibited replication of equine influenza A virus FLUAV A/Eq/Miami/1/63 (H3N8) in mice and exhibited no toxicity at effective antiviral concentrations in vivo. PPMO can block host protease cleavage of the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) to inhibit viral infectivity. treatment of human Calu-3 epithelial cells with a PPMO T-ex5 resulted in production of TMPRSS2 mRNA lacking exon 5 that resulted in production of an inactive form of TMPRSS2. PPMO targeting both the 5\u2032-terminus and AUG translation start site of the SINV genome significantly suppressed SINV replication in tissue culture. VEEV is another member of the family togaviridae. single-stranded RNA virus containing three ORFs is currently classified within the family Hepeviridae (Nan and Zhang, 2016). PPMO targeting the 5\u2032 terminal of the HEV genome at the start codon of ORF1 are highly effective against both HEV genotypes 1 and 3 infection in vitro. KSHV infection in humans exhibits either a lifelong immunologically silent and latent infection or a transient lytic infection with distinct viral gene-expression profiles. expression of a few key viral regulators, such as latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) encoded by ORF73, viral cyclin (vCyclin) encoded by ORF72 and viral FLIP (vFLIP) encoded by ORF71, are observed during latency. treatment of KSHV-positive PEL cells with PPMO RP1 reduced RTA expression. also caused down-regulation of several other early and late KSHV gene products. PPMO against vIL-6 and vIRF-1 also evaluated. in vitro evaluation of PPMO effects on expression of multiple viral genes was conducted. but in vivo results defied expectations drawn from in vitro studies. PPMO targets selected using in vitro assessments may not achieve expected inhibition in vivo. PPMO were well-tolerated in uninfected mice after 7 days of administration of 100 g/day. PPMO targeting ICP0 or ICP27 mRNA were also highly effective against either non-ACV-resistant or ACV-resistant HSV-2 strains. mRNA-like properties of positive-sense RNA virus genomes make them highly susceptible to PMO-mediated translation inhibition if the PMOs pairing sequence are located at the 5\u2032 terminal end of the viral genomes. however, data appears to be mixed for 3\u2032 terminal-targeting PMOs. the viral genome 5\u2032 end is the preferred target region for antiviral PMO design against positive-sense RNA viruses. the viral genome 5\u2032 end is the preferred target region for antiviral PMO design against positive-sense RNA viruses. anantpadma et al., 2010 Chikungunya virus ORF1 AUG region Lam et al., 2015 togaviridae Sindbis virus 5\u2032 terminal end and AUG translation start site regions Paessler et al., 2008 Caliciviridae Noroviruses AUG region of ORF1 near the 5\u2032 end of the genome Bok et al., 2008 Negative sense RNA virus Filoviridae Ebol unstructured regions are more accessible to oligonucleotide binding than structured regions. direct targeting of IRES sequences could inhibit replication of some viruses, including members of the order Picornavirales. UL30 and UL39 encode the viral DNA polymerase and the large subunit of ribonucleotide reductase. blocking mRNA translation by PMO did not significantly reduce viral replication or transmission from infected cells. a HCMV mutant with sequence-dependent resistance to the phosphorothioate oligonucleotide Fomivirsen was discovered almost simultaneously with market approval of the drug. mutations within or outside of PMO-targeting sequences may lead to PMO resistance. mutations within or outside of PMO-targeting sequences may lead to PMO resistance and will be a future challenge. cells with a PPMO designed to interfere with pre-mRNA splicing of TMPRSS2 resulted in TMPRSS2 mRNA lacking exon 5. blocking of HA0 cleavage by this PPMO was confirmed in different human seasonal and pandemic influenza A viruses and resulted in significant reduction of viral titers. three generations of PMO have been developed (unmodified PMO, conjugated PMO, and PMOplus) to improve intracellular delivery. however, several issues remain unresolved before PMO are adopted. PMO should serve as a promising strategy for treatments of a variety of diseases, including difficult-to-treat viral infections. results discussed in this review show great promise and warrant further research to develop safe and effective antisense treatments for a variety of human diseases. author contributions YN and Y-JZ designed this manuscript."}
