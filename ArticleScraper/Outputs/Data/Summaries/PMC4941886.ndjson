{"summary": "1, 2 Eradication of influenza is impossible but continuous immunization of the population can minimize the impact of the disease. 3 The risk of a new pandemic is at its highest level since the last pandemic in 1968. d'expertise et d'Information sur la grippe (GEIG) questionnaire mailed out in may. a total of 47 982 respondents were included in each country in each season. questions covered reasons to get vaccinated this winter. ninety-five percent confidence intervals (CI) were reported as appropriate. no correction for multiple testing was made. the increase between season 2004/05 and season 2005/06 was statistically significant (P 0001) this was mainly due to significant increases in immunization uptake in Germany and Italy. adjusted the overall vaccination rate in Europe resulted in an average vaccination rate of 268% in season 2005/06. in the year 2005/06 390% of respondents expressed the intention to get vaccinated against influenza in the coming winter of 2006/07. the overall vaccination coverage rate in persons aged 65 increased over time (Figure 2). The increase between season 2004/05 and season 2005/06 was statistically significant (P 0001). Coverage in the elderly was highest in Great Britain (79%) and lowest in Germany and Italy (634%). Table 2 shows unadjusted odds ratios for the target groups for the year 2005/06. adjusted odds ratios were investigated in logistic regression models. adjusted odds ratios were investigated in logistic regression models. multivariate adjustment showed significantly higher vaccination rates for healthcare workers in Great Britain (OR: 18, 95% CI: 15\u201322), France (OR: 17, 95% CI: 14\u201321), Italy (OR: 14, 95% CI: 11\u201319), and Spain (or: 21, 95% CI: 16\u201336). the impact of chronic illness on the vaccination rate was significantly lower after multivariate adjustment. 3 (33) 3 (37) 4 (36) 3 (19) 2 (40) 3 (24) I do not think I am very likely to catch influenza 1 (34) 3 (30) 2 (44) 2 (21) 4 (15) 1 (63) I have never considered it before 2 (33) 1 (37) 3 (37) 3 (36) 3 (19) 2 (40) 3 (24) The proportion of respondents whose decision to get vaccinated was influenced by the recent attention given to avian influenza. only the proportion of those vaccinated most frequently stated reasons were no expectation of catching influenza, not having considered vaccination, and absence of a family physician\u2019s recommendation. the level of knowledge about influenza and the vaccine among the general population was similar across countries. aged 65 years (%)1 190 229 174 195 123 182 Male (%) 489 478 487 480 496 486 Healthcare workers (%)2 66 73 37 58 51 57 Chronic illness (%)3 142 228 137 156 102 153 Target group: 1, 2 or 3 above (%) 332 427 291 339 242 326 Vaccination rates decreased from 225% (95% CI: 216\u2013234%) in season 2001/02 to in 2005/06, 390% of respondents expressed the intention to get vaccinated against influenza in the coming winter of 2006/07. over the years, the proportion of those expressing such an intention was on average 36%, about 13% higher than the actual vaccination rate. the gap was highest in Germany and almost nonexistent in Italy in season 2005/06. the vaccination rate in this group increased over the years and the increase in season 2005/06 was significantly different from the previous season. the coverage rate in the combined target group was highest in Great Britain (60%) and lowest in Germany (49%). but this result could be influenced by the observed difference in the proportion of chronically ill respondents in Germany. table 2 shows unadjusted odds ratios for the target groups for the year 2005/06. adjusted odds ratios took into account gender, age over 65 years, work in medical field, and chronic illness. for years where data on chronic illness were not available, data were only adjusted for the remaining covariates. in france the most commonly stated reason for getting vaccinated was that the vaccine is provided free. over the 5year period, the ranking of the cause for getting vaccinated did not change substantially. only the proportion of those vaccinated for first time was statistically higher among the group influenced by the attention given to avian influenza (P 0001) the most frequently stated reasons were no expectation of catching influenza, not having considered vaccination, and absence of a family physician\u2019s recommendation. a statistically significant increment of 25% was observed between season 2004/05 and season 2005/06. this was mainly due to significant increases in immunization uptake in Germany and Italy. in the elderly 65 years, the lowest coverage was observed in Germany and Italy. a realistic vaccination coverage rate target in Europe could be set at the level of vaccination intentions (39%) in the general population, the characteristics of those who gave the attention to avian influenza were not statistically different from the rest of the vaccinated group. in the u.s. people with landlines had a higher odds (127) of being vaccinated than those with only access to wireless telephones. 20 If this is believed to be similar in Europe, we might have slightly overestimated the vaccination rate.
