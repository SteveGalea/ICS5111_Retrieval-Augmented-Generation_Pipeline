{"summary": "health care facilities of all types in china were required to report any patient who had no clear diagnosis and whose illness met 4 criteria. the criteria were fever (axillary temperature >38C); radiologic characteristics consistent with pneumonia; 3) reduced or normal leukocyte count or low lymphocyte count during early stages of disease; 4) worsening of symptoms or no obvious improvement after 3\u20135 days of standard antimicrobial treatment. china CDC would guide or become directly involved in the field investigation if needed. all specimens from reported PUE cases were required to be tested for influenza A(H5N1) but also for seasonal influenza A, influenza B, and influenza A(H7N9) by real-time reverse transcription PCR (3). if test results for both influenza types A and B were negative, further testing would be performed. to better understand testing patterns during the A(H7N9) outbreak, we looked at historical reporting in the PUE surveillance system from January 2004 through March 2013. we also examined all PUE cases reported to China CDC during March 30\u2013May 3, 2013 and calculated the proportion positive for A(H7N9) by province and in different age and sex groups. upper or lower respiratory tract specimens from each patient were tested for influenza A(H5N1) and for SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and beginning in October 2012, for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. if specimens were negative for A(H5N1) and SARS-CoV, no further testing was required. local-level evaluation of cases was streamlined in early April 2013. the fourth reporting criterion above (antimicrobial treatment failure) was replaced with a requirement that the pneumonia etiology could not be attributed to an alternative clinical or laboratory diagnoses. the study examined the number of confirmed A(H7N9) cases and the proportion of PUE cases who tested positive for A(H7N9) in the week before and the 2 weeks after LPM closures in Shanghai (population 30.5 million), Nanjing (population 8.2 million), and Hangzhou (population 8.8 million). the estimated median incubation period of A(H7N9) infection was 6 days (interquartile range 4\u20137). PUE cases peaked at 61 per day on April 8, 2013, and then dropped rapidly in the following 3 weeks. most PUE cases were reported from Shanghai (468 [42%] of 1,118) and Zhejiang (388 [26%]. most PUE cases were reported from Shanghai (468 [42%] of 1,118) number of reported PUE cases and number positive for influenza A(H7N9) virus in 10 affected areas, mainland China, March 30\u2013May 3, 2013*. the number of cases among female patients was lower overall (449 [45%] of 1,002) 0.435 15\u201324 128 0 64 0 64 0 25\u201359 399 42 (11) 195 28 (14) 204 14 (7) 0.015 >60 315 51 (16) 198 34 (17) 117 17 (15) 0.539 Total 1002 94 (9) 553 62 (11) 449 32 (7) 0.027 *PUE, pneumonia of unknown etiology. in the 8\u201314 days after closure, 1 and 0 cases were confirmed in those cities. the proportion of PUE cases positive for A(H7N9) also declined from 14% and 25% before closure to 2% and 12% 1\u20137 days later and 1% and 0% 8\u201314 days later. the number of reported PUE cases increased above minimum levels only during known outbreaks of A(H5N1) and SARS, the only pathogens for which there had been testing. the number of reported cases increased above minimum levels only during known outbreaks of A(H5N1) and SARS, the only pathogens for which there had been testing. the decline in reported cases after LPM closure probably reflects a true decline in the number of cases. before the A(H7N9) outbreak, it was used to report most A(H5N1) cases in china. the system was not (and still is not) used consistently. 68% of all PUE cases were reported from Shanghai and Zhejiang province. however, only 10% of all PUE cases were reported in the 21 unaffected provinces. variation probably occurs among provinces in the screening that preceded reporting a PUE case. this contrasts sharply with A(H5N1) cases in china. more PUE cases were reported among men who were also more likely to test positive. the reason may be that these men are more exposed to poultry through occupation or behavior. the proportion of PUE cases positive for A(H7N9) decreased after market closure in Hangzhou. the substantial decrease in reporting and testing immediately after market closure may have affected PUE reporting is unknown."}
