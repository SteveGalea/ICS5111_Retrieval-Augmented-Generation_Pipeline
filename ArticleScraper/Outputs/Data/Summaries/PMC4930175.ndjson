{"summary": "the HCV genome is composed of a long open reading frame (ORF) the ORF encodes a polyprotein of approximately 3010 amino acids. microRNA-122 (miR-122) is the most abundant miRNA in the liver. miR-122 regulates hepatic function and cholesterol and fatty-acid metabolisms. miRNA 3\u2032 modification is known to regulate its stability or turnover. despite the ample evidence of post-transcriptional modification on mature miRNAs, the impact of miRNA 3\u2032-end modifications is largely unknown. the miR-122 level was 100-fold lower than that in the normal liver N-1. in this cell line, HCV infection elicited a 70 1.5% decrease in miR-122 levels at 2 days post infection. the miR-122 level decreased gradually during the course of HCV infection as early as day 1 post-infection. miR-122 precursors were analyzed by real-time qRT-PCR of total RNAs isolated from indicated stable cell lines. cells were harvested to assess expression levels of miR-122 (*P = 0.0025; F) and miR-221 (G) and cell viability (H) lines that individually express the HCV core protein, NS5B, and NS proteins (NS3 to NS5B from an HCV genotype 1b subgenomic replicon) the expression of the mature form of miR-122 was not altered by the core protein. miR-122 precursors (primary and precursor forms of miR-122) were not influenced by the core protein. psiCHEK-2_CULT1(WT) dual-luciferase reporter vector contains the CULT1 3\u2032-UTR, a known target of miR-122 [23]. the reporter activity, which was suppressed by miR-122 duplex transfection, could be rescued by the HCV core protein. cells were 76.5 5.1% of the Huh7/vector control. the HCV subgenomic RNA titer was determined 2 days after transfection by real-time qRT-PCR. the titer was expressed as percentage of that in empty vector-transfected control cells. miR-122 transfection into R-1 cells increased HCV subgenomic RNA titer. the expression of the core protein in R-1 cells and its expression in Huh7 prior to HCV (JFH-1) resulted in significant decrease in HCV RNA levels (50.8 2.8% and 61 5.4% of control, respectively) we performed high-throughput sequencing of small RNA libraries from human liver biopsy specimens from healthy individuals (N-1 and N-2) and patients with HCV (HCV-1 to HCV-3). we detected various miR-122 species in the range of 16 to 25 nucleotide (nt) in length. isomer profile analysis for the top 50 most abundantly expressed miRNAs in the liver biopsies revealed that all miRNAs bear a single 3\u2032 terminal non-templated nucleotide. non-templated nucleotide addition to the 3\u2032 end of miR-122 is suppressed in liver tissue from patients with HCV. 23-nt isomers are sorted according to their 3\u2032-end dinucleotide sequences. the pri-miR-122 sequence shows processing sites (blue arrows) for the 22-nt prototype miR-122 and an aberrant 3\u2032-terminal processing site (black arrow) for the 23-nt isomer bearing a template-derived 3\u2032 GU-tail. analysis of small RNA sequencing datasets for each species of the 24-nt miR-122 isomers revealed that their relative ratios decreased by >2-fold in HCV-infected liver tissues. the total read counts of the 24-nt miR-122 isomers were relatively low (approximately 1% of total reads; S3 Table) polymerase [29] decreased the cellular abundance of three major miR-122 isomers (21-, 22-, and 23-nt isomers) resulting in an overall 49% decrease in their miRNA levels and consequent decreases in HCV subgenomic RNA and viral protein (NS3 and NS5B) levels. miR-122 levels were assessed by northern blot analysis after resolving total RNA on a 20cm 20cm denaturing polyacrylamide gel (D) levels of GLD-2, NS3 and NS5B proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting. we tested the adenylation activity of the purified recombinant GLD-2 with an N-terminal histidine tag. we found that wild-type GLD-2, but not its inactive form GLD-2, monoadenylates miR-122-5p. this result was unexpected because GLD-2 was originally identified as a non-canonical cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerase that acts on certain mRNAs. LD-2\u2019s 3\u2032-end monoadenylation activity, whereas severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) capsid protein had little effect on GLD-2 activity. radioactivity present in the bands was quantified using a PhosphorImager. interaction of the HCV core protein with GLD-2 in the cytoplasm is required for the downregulation of miR-122 following HCV infection. Fig 6 shows the ability of the core protein to interact with endogenous GLD-2. nuclei were visualized by DAPI staining. subcellular localization of GFP-fused full-length HCV core protein and its truncated derivatives transiently expressed in Huh7 cells for 48 h. spanning amino acids 174\u2013191, downregulate miR-122 expression. other truncation mutants failed to decrease miR-122 levels. this indicates that the RNA-binding activity of the core protein is not involved in this regulation. d nucleotide addition to miR-122 promotes its activity and stability. all of the 23-nt miR-122 isomers significantly increased the reporter-suppressing activity compared with the 21-nt isomer in a reporter assay with the psiCHEK-2_CULT1(WT) plasmid. reporter plasmid psiCHECK-2_CULT1 harboring a miR-122 target. shown is the normalized luciferase activity (Rluc/Fluc) compared with the scrambled siRNA-transfected control. the miR-122 level was 100-fold lower than that in the normal liver N-1 (1.25% of miR-122 levels in N-1) in this cell line, HCV infection elicited a 70 1.5% decrease in miR-122 levels at 2 days post infection. the miR-122 level decreased gradually during the course of HCV infection as early as day 1 post-infection. plotted in (D) are the relative levels of miR-122 (mean SD) estimated from three independent experiments. the error bars are the standard deviations of three independent experiments. miR-122 levels in Huh7-derived cell lines express the HCV core protein, NS5B, and NS proteins (NS3 to NS5B from an HCV genotype 1b subgenomic replicon) the expression of miR-122 precursors (primary and precursor forms of miR-122) was not altered by the core protein (Fig 1E), demonstrating that miR-122 transcription and biogenesis were not affected. the downregulating effect of the HCV core protein was also observed in mouse primary hepatocytes. a psiCHEK-2_CULT1(WT) dual-luciferase reporter vector contains the CULT1 3\u2032-UTR, a known target of miR-122 [23], showed that the reporter activity could be rescued by the HCV core protein both in Huh7 and R-1 cells. the cholesterol content in core-expressing cells was 76.5 5.1% of the Huh7/vector control. the HCV subgenomic RNA titer was determined 2 days after transfection by real-time qRT-PCR. cellular cholesterol metabolism plays direct or indirect roles in the HCV life cycle [24]. we found a decrease in the cellular total cholesterol content in the core protein-expressing stable cell line Huh7/core. miR-122 transfection into R-1 cells increased HCV subgenomic RNA titer. miR-122 isomers of 21, 22, and 23 nt in length are three prominent species. the proportion of individual miR-122 isomers was substantially altered in patient liver biopsies. the ratio for the 22-nt miR-22 prototype species only slightly decreased. isomer profile analysis for the top 50 most abundantly expressed miRNAs in the liver biopsies revealed that all miRNAs bear a single 3\u2032 terminal non-templated or templated nucleotide. non-templated nucleotide addition to the 3\u2032 end of miR-122 is suppressed in liver tissue from patients with HCV. pri-miR-122 sequence shows processing sites (blue arrows) for 22-nt prototype miR-122. aberrant 3\u2032-terminal processing site for 23-nt isomer bearing a template-derived 3\u2032 GU-tail. % of each isomer read count compared with read counts of four major miR-122 isomers in the indicated liver biopsies. analysis of small RNA datasets for each species of the 24-nt miR-122 isomers revealed that their relative ratios decreased by >2-fold in HCV-infected liver tissues. adenylate residues, which is the major modification event of miR-122, were substantially inhibited by HCV. miR-122 abundance is specifically regulated by GLD-2, a non-canonical cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerase [29] (also known as terminal uridylyl transferase 2 (TUTase-2)) miR-122 level in Huh7 cells silenced for indicated terminal nucleotidyl. miR-122 levels were determined by real-time qRT-PCR at 48 h post-siRNA transfection (20 nM). the miR-122 level was determined by real-time qRT-PCR at 48 h post-siRNA transfection (20 nM). ylate to the 3\u2032 end of miR-122 and sought to test whether GLD-2 catalytic activity is inhibited by the HCV core protein. initially, we tested the adenylation activity of the purified recombinant GLD-2 with an N-terminal histidine tag. we found that wild-type GLD-2, but not its inactive form GLD-2(D215A), monoadenylates miR-122-5p. this result the HCV core protein inhibits GLD-2\u2019s 3\u2032-end monoadenylation activity. severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) capsid protein had little effect on GLD-2 activity. translin mRNA expression level was not altered by the core protein. inhibition of GLD-2-catalyzed 3\u2032 non-templated nucleotide addition by the core protein is responsible for the downregulation of miR-122 following HCV infection. indirect double-immunofluorescence staining of the core protein and GLD-2 in Huh7 cells transiently expressing the Flag-tagged core protein. nuclei were visualized by DAPI staining. FP-C(99\u2013191) localized in the cytoplasm due to presence of the C-terminal region spanning amino acids 174\u2013191, downregulate miR-122 expression. other truncation mutants failed to decrease miR-122 levels. truncation mutants GFP-C(1\u201375), GFP-C(1\u2013121) and GFP-C(1\u2013173) failed to decrease miR-122 levels. 3\u2032-End nucleotide addition to miR-122 promotes its activity and stability in cells. all of the 23-nt miR-122 isomers increased the reporter-suppressing activity compared with the 21-nt isomer. shown is the normalized luciferase activity (Rluc/Fluc) compared with the scrambled siRNA-transfected control. transfected cells were co-transfected with duplex forms of miR-122 isomers. the HCV core protein inhibits GLD-2 by decreasing the proportion of mono-adenylated isomers. only six miRNAs exhibited a decrease in their 3\u2032-end monoadenylated isomer levels upon HCV infection. the cellular abundance of these miRNAs was diverse (S3A Fig) GLD-2 showed a much higher terminal transferase activity on 20-mer homopolymer (A) than other homopolymeric RNA templates (S5C Fig). these results suggested that miRNA sequence and/or structure might also important determinants for GLD-2 template selectivity. the ability of GLD-2 to use UTP and ATP as a substrate was also observed in the 24-nt isomers in which the U-tailed 23-nt isomer was further extended by the addition of a single uridylate or adenylate residue. in these miR-122 species, the non-templated addition of uridylate residues was repeatedly observed in five different liver biopsies. a substantial decrease in the proportion of the single U-tailed abundantly present 23-nt miR-122 isomer (aberrantly processed or terminally modified one), suggesting that pre-miR-122 processing in its single-stranded loop region might also be influenced by HCV infection. the HCV core protein is also known to be involved in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. protein can be one of the mechanisms accelerating tumor development by chronic HCV infection through a previously uncovered pathway. the loss of GLD-2 could be involved in carcinogenesis. we can speculate that cytoplasmic poly (A) addition to some host mRNAs 3\u2032-UTR can be inhibited by the HCV core protein. it remains to be characterized what host mRNAs are subjected to this regulation. pcDNA3.1-Flag-core plasmid expressing the flag epitope-tagged full-length HCV NS5B was previously constructed. psiCHECK-2_CULT1(WT) and psiCHECK-2_CULT1(MT) were provided by Liang-Hu Qu (Sun Yat-Sen University, China) pTrcHisB-GLD-2(D215A) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis to express an inactive GLD-2(D215A) carrying an Ala substitution for Asp215 at the catalytic active site of GLD-2 [19] the bicistronic vector pDual-IRES, which expresses a cap-dependent Rluc reporter and an HCV IRES-dependent Fluc reporter was described previously [49] miRNAs were obtained from ST Pharm (Seoul, Korea) the sequences of miRNAs used in this study are shown in S5A Fig. the cDNA library for small RNA was prepared for Illumina sequencing. the amplified PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on an agarose gel. the DNA band of an appropriate size was then excised from the gel. individual mapped sequence reads were compiled into a set of unique sequences with the read counts for each sequence reflecting the relative abundance. unique sequence read counts were normalized to the total read counts of the \u201cmapped\u201d dataset in millions to give reads per million. blot analysis Total RNA (20 g) isolated from Huh7 cells using trizol reagent was resolved by electrophoresis on a 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. the membrane was pre-hybridized for 30 min and then hybridized with a 5\u2032-radiolabeled antisense probe overnight. immunoprecipitates or lysates (30 g) were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) for detection of HCV HCVcore protein in chimeric mice, liver tissues were homogenized, mixed with an equal volume of a standard RIPA lysis buffer. the clear lysates (100 g) were analyzed by immuoblotting. siRNAs targeting GLD-2 and other nucleotidyl transferases were designed according to the GLD-2 mRNA sequence (GenBank NM 001114394) and previous studies were obtained from ST Pharm (Seoul, Korea) siRNAs were transfected into cells using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen), according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C to 0.8 OD at 600 nm. protein expression was induced at 25\u00b0C by the addition of 1 mM isopropyl--d-thiogalactopyranoside for 12 h. 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 20 U of RNase inhibitor (Promega), 10 Ci of [-32P] rNTP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 250 ng of miRNA or 30 pmol ribonucleotide homopolymer (20-nt) and 3.75 pmol of purified GLD-2.
