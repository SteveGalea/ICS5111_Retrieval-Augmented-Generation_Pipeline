{"summary": "ZIKV is a positive-sense RNA virus that belongs to the family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus. it is similar to dengue virus (DENV), yellow fever virus, japanese encephalitis virus, and west Nile virus. sporadic cases of negligible concern associated with human ZIKV infection were reported. recent outbreaks of ZIKV infections have become fatal on a daily basis in the Americas. the reported occurrences of ZIKV infections are thought to be transmitted mainly by the mosquito species Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. the diagnosis of viral infection requires a routine follow-up to examine thrombocytes along with hematocrit. for CHIKV, chronic arthralgia should be assessed due to its high prevalence. a variety of arboviral infections (arthropod-borne; DENV is the most common arboviral infection) may have similar clinical presentations. testing should be performed in pregnant women with positive or inconclusive results from ZIKV testing. patients with deNV and ZIKV present with temperatures >40\u00b0C and 38.5\u00b0C, respectively. there is still a need to search for and improve on more sensitive and reliable detection methods for the challenging virus candidate ZIKV. there is still a need to search for and improve upon more sensitive and reliable detection methods for the challenging virus candidate ZIKV. V/DENV/ Chikungunya virus 108 to 10 copies/L for ZIKV. from 108 to 102 copies/L for Dengue-1 Waggoner et al., 2016 Real-time-PCR Saliva/Blood ZIKV Tested for positive/negative samples. ide detection based on loop-mediated isothermal amplification Virus cell culture/Human serum ZIKV 1 aM synthetic ZIKV oligonucleotide Tian et al., 2016 Liposome-based detection assay Virus cell culture DENV 50 RNA molecules for serotype 2, 500 RNA molecules for serotypes 3 and 4, and 50,000 RNA molecules for serotype 1. a real-time reverse transcription PCR assay is available for the detection of Micronesian ZIKV strains in Africa and Asia. it does not cover the genetic diversity and geographic distribution of ZIKV. current diagnostic techniques for ZIKV infection are time-consuming. Detection of DENV was confirmed using a recombinase polymerase amplification assay. a specific and sensitive real-time PCR assay was tested for the presence of ZIKV in 88 Dengue and Chikungunya-negative sera samples. the assay displayed specific detection of ZIKV with a low detection limit. Kilianski et al. (2016) developed an unamplified RNA/complementary DNA assay for the detection of RNA viruses. the developed method was able to detect Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus within 3 hours of acquisition. nanopore sequencing is a novel genomics technology, which has potential applications for routine biosurveillance, clinical diagnosis, and outbreak investigation of virus infections. PCR-based molecular techniques have aided in the easy detection of a variety of viruses. these methods are prone to miss detections, favoring false negative results and requiring proper quality control measures. however, precautions have been taken to overcome the problem of inhibition. programmable RNA sensors referred to as \u201ctoehold switches\u201d could be first technology to be rationally applied to bind virtually any sense RNA sequence. a freeze-dried, paper-based, cell-free protein expression platform allows the application of these toehold switches outside of laboratories by providing an abiotic, sterile method. in flavivirus infections, immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies develop within a few days after the onset of illness. in addition, immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies are developed within a few days after development of IgM antibodies. Euroimmun (2016) has developed the first complete test package for the serological detection of ZIKV infections. the ELISAs and indirect immunofluorescence assays allow the determination of specific antibodies against a variety of viruses in the blood of infected patients. yellow fever is another acute viral infection transmitted through mosquito bites. it is strongly believed that the current emergence and re-emergence of yellow fever is partly attributed to the increased migration of people from disease-endemic regions. the use of flavivirus antigens in the development of MAbs has not been well documented. ka fever is a zoonotic infection caused by ZIKV, which shares the limelight with other well-known members of the flavivirus family. there is a high possibility that there may be detection principles and vaccine development strategies that are applicable to both viruses. antibody-integrated magnetic beads were useful for capturing DENVs. the capturing of DENV1-4 was confirmed by the results of the real-time PCR analysis. this method could be used in combination with real-time PCR for the detection of DENV. oligonucleotide detection system can recognize 1 aM synthetic ZIKV oligonucleotide in 20% serum with a total assay time of 27 min. the results suggest that this could be a promising strategy that may give rise to new possibilities for diagnosing and controlling ZIKV infection. ELISA is the most widely accepted serological technique in developing countries. but ELISA has become the technique that is most often applied for the serological diagnosis of DENV infection in deNV epidemic regions. characterization and detection of viruses is a labor-intensive and time-consuming process. biosensors based on liposome technology have been successfully used for the development of rapid, inexpensive, and field-utilizable detection systems. liposome-based immunoassays show applicability in various areas of food chemistry, food microbiology, nano-biotechnology and diagnostic or clinical microbiology, for the detection of foodborne pathogens, toxins, and hazardous components. the amount of liposomes present in the immobilized complex is directly proportional to the amount of target sequence present in the sample. connelly et al. (2012) also developed a method involving microfluidic pre-concentration coupled to liposome-based signal amplification to efficiently detect viruses in environmental samples. liposomes can be used to encapsulate a variety of electrochemical markers. liposomes can be used to encapsulate glioma cells in vitro and in vivo. immunoliposomes have successfully been observed in vitro and in vivo. in propagated cells, the detection of a virus is confirmed by its cytopathic effect in cell culture. positive results are confirmed using tissue culture with an infectious dose 50 (TCID50) in plaque assays. a real-time reverse transcription PCR assay is available for the detection of Micronesian ZIKV strains in Africa and Asia. the real-time quantitative PCR assay was able to detect 37 ZIKV isolates. the real-time quantitative PCR analysis confirmed that the developed assay was able to detect ZIKV infection in amniotic fluid. the same assay showed negative results for the detection of ZIKV infection in urine and serum samples. the assay displayed specific detection of ZIKV with a low detection limit (140 copies of viral RNA), suggesting that this assay could be useful for viral detection in a variety of environmental samples. the developed assay identified 17 co-infections in ZIKV-positive patients, suggesting its potential for application as a multiplex diagnostic test. Kilianski et al. (2016) sequenced unamplified poly(A)-tailed viral RNA using a rapid cDNA library preparation coupled with real-time data analysis. this approach for pathogen genomic characterization differs from the previously used methods on the MinION platform. such approaches limit characterization to known pathogens and require additional viral genome amplification. PCR-based methods are inability to differentiate between infectious and non-infectious viruses. integrated cell culture-PCR assays allow rapid virus detection with selective enumeration of infectious viruses. the long incubation period required to reveal a cytopathic effect is a major limitation. sterile method for the distribution and storage of genetic circuits at room temperature could provide a rapid and inexpensive platform for the development of easy-to-use virus diagnostic sensors. standard serological methodologies involving antibody detection present limitations due to their cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses detected in previously infected patients. the Zika MAC-ELISA is employed for in vitro qualitative detection of ZIKV-specific IgM antibodies in human sera. testing of ZIKV has been applied based on CDC clinical and epidemiological criteria for ZIKV. immune responses under ZIKV infection have only been described in a small number of patients (n = 11) antibodies against ZIKV showed high specificity, confirming the applicability of Euroimmun ELISA for specific detection of virus in patients exposed previously to flavivirus or vaccine. the results suggest that this method could be an effective diagnostic tool for the screening and counseling of patients with a possibility of ZIKV virus infection. MAb-based antigen detection ELISA enabled the detection of virus in 40 culture supernatants containing titers of approximately 1,000 plaque forming units (pfu) the results suggest that MAb-based antigen detection ELISA enabled the detection of virus in 40 culture supernatants containing titers of approximately 1,000 plaque forming units. magnetic nanoparticles have been successfully used for biomedical and environmental applications. magnetic nanoparticles have been encapsulated with a protective shell of graphite, silica, or polymer for chemical stability. the capturing of DENV1-4 using antibody-integrated magnetic beads was confirmed by the results of the real-time PCR analysis. deNV may increase the sensitivity of viral detection for the diagnosis of DENV. based on these findings, it can be hypothesized that this method could be extended for the accurate detection of ZIKV through the immobilization of an anti-ZIKV antibody on the functionalized surface of graphite magnetic nanoparticles. the proposed detection system can recognize 1 aM synthetic ZIKV oligonucleotide in 20% serum with a total assay time of 27 min. the results suggest that this could be a promising strategy that may give rise to new possibilities for diagnosing and controlling ZIKV infection. PCR-based methods require thermal cycling instruments and transformation of DENV/ZIKV genomic RNA to DNA. the assay showed 92% reliability in DENV serotype determination. biosensors based on liposome technology have been successfully used for the development of rapid, inexpensive, and field-utilizable detection systems. liposome immunoassays involve a liposome-encapsulating marker, prepared with a phospholipid composition and coupled to either analyte or antibody through a suitable procedure. the biosensor assay was based on a membrane-based DNA/RNA hybridization system with liposome amplification. liposomes were mixed with the amplified target sequence and applied to the membrane. liposome-based assays are being used in biomedical and therapeutic applications as clinical diagnostic assays. liposome-based lateral flow assays coupled with nucleic acid sequence-based amplification have been proved to represent an effective alternative for the rapid and sensitive detection of viable bacterial pathogens. liposomes can be used to encapsulate a variety of electrochemical markers. liposome system targeting glioma cells in vitro and in vivo. immunoliposomes have been used to deliver contrast agents and radionuclides for diagnostic imaging and therapy. commercial serology tests will become increasingly available for the detection of a variety of viruses. Euroimmun in germany offers an IgM/IgG immunofluorescence assay and an IgM/IgG ELISA based on a NS1 protein. validation data indicate cross-reactivity with antibodies directed against tick-borne encephalitis virus, west Nile virus, and deNV. 210 positive results from 748 blood samples (28.1%) and 182 positive results from 319 saliva samples (57.1%) were the overall number of real-time PCR-positive ZIKV samples. the analysis confirmed 210 positive results from 748 blood samples (28.1%). there are currently no available studies on liposome-based assays for the detection of ZIKV. a specific liposome-based assay can be applied with our developed liposome particles to develop a liposome-based detection system for analyzing ZIKV. liposome assay will involve an antigen capture zone (test line) on a nitrocellulose membrane strip. liposomes are encapsulated in sulforhodamine B and tagged with anti-ZIKV antibody specific for the binding of the specific ZIKV particle. the immunoliposomes migrate along the test strip via capillary action and subsequently bind to the capture antibody zone. sulforhodamine B-encapsulated liposomes can be encapsulated at a high concentration within lipid and phospholipid vesicles to form sulforhodamine B-encapsulated liposomes. the integrity of the sulforhodamine B-encapsulated antibody-tagged liposomes with a target virus particle can be determined by measuring the increase in fluorescence after lysis of the immunoliposome particles multiplexing assays may be based on liposome-based immunochromatographic strips. multiplex tests should be able to detect the ZIKV antibodies in cases of concurrent infection with both pathogens. multiplex tests should be able to detect both RNA and anti-ZIKV IgM. studies should attempt to confirm the practical applications of liposome-based virus detection assays in various food samples contaminated with foodborne viruses. ZIKV is classified as a biological safety level 2 pathogenic agent. precautions should be taken by pregnant women while working in the laboratory. new approaches based on liposome particles should be of interest for the detection of ZIKV. new insights and interpretations should be obtained by studying the mechanisms of several similar detection strategies that are being developed."}
