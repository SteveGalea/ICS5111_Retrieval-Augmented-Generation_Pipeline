{"summary": "the need for the general population to wear face masks is likely to be a key component in ensuring continuity of essential services (eg, public needing to wear face masks in health care settings) the need for the general population to wear face masks is likely to be a key component in ensuring continuity of essential services (eg, public needing to wear face masks in health care settings) studies of public health compliance during or around SARS outbreaks in Hong Kong indicated that 71% would wear face masks if there was a resurgence of SARS. 71% would wear face masks if there was a resurgence of SARS. 78% of respondents would accept quarantine, and 84% would stay indoors. in the comparative Europe/Asia study,15 45%\u201352% would limit contact with family and friends. 24%\u201335% would stay indoors. studies of public health compliance during or around SARS outbreaks have been published in recent years. studies include either reported levels of compliance during the outbreaks of SARS and H5N1/avian influenza, or in anticipation of an H5N1/avian influenza pandemic. 73.8% of respondents reported that they would wear a mask in public venues and 88.3% said they would be fully compliant with any quarantine policies. increased compliance often associated with higher risk perception and anxiety,16 concern for self/family/children,10,16 perceived susceptibility,17,18 greater knowledge regarding transmission,13. questions on potential threats were field tested, validated and administered within the NSW Population Health Survey. the survey includes questions on health behaviors, health status (including psychological distress, using the Kessler 10 measure,20 and self-rated health status), access to health services, as well as the demographics of the respondents and the households. data analysis was performed using the \u201cSVY\u201d commands of Stata version 9.2. the five-point Likert-scale response used in the question module were dichotomized, such that responses of very/extremely willing (high willingness) were coded as 1 and all other responses as 0. This enabled identification and analysis of a group in the sample that reported high universal willingness to comply. 0.05 were retained in the final model. pandemic influenza question module comprised three questions addressing pandemic influenza threat perception and three questions addressing willingness to comply with requested protective health behaviors. all responses were coded on a five-point Likert-scale. respondents who indicated they would be very/extremely willing to comply with all three behaviors had their response coded as 1 and those with willingness to comply with two or fewer behaviors were coded as 0. this enabled identification and analysis of a group in the sample that reported high universal willingness to comply. of the population reported being \u2018not at all\u2019 willing to wear a face mask. considerably lower proportions of the population were \u2018not at all\u2019 willing to comply with vaccination (3%) and isolation (5%) 0.011 1.67 1.10 2.54 0.017 Born in Australia No 1.00 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 Yes 0.26 0.90 1.76 0.175 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 Speak language other than English No 1.00 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 Yes 0.62 0.41 0.95 0.026 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 Living alone No 1.00 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 Yes 0.85 0.64 1.11 0.234 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 Pandemic influenza extremely/very likely No 1.00 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 0.011 1.75 1.00 3.06 0.051 45\u201354 2.24 1.34 3.76 0.002 1.98 1.17 3.38 0.012 55\u201364 2.25 1.35 3.76 0.002 1.95 1.15 3.30 0.013 65\u201374 2.71 1.63 4.51 0.001 2.34 1.39 3.96 0.001 75+ 2.37 1.37 4.09 0.002 1.82 1.03 3.23 0.041 Children in household No 1.00 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 the influence of age on willingness to comply with protective behaviors was found to be a key variable, and this effect is illustrated in Figure 1. The influence of age on willingness to comply with protective behaviors was found to be a key variable. two thirds of the population reported that they would be very/extremely willing to receive vaccination. two thirds reported that they would be very/extremely willing to isolate if needed. more than half reported that they would be very/extremely willing to wear a face mask. in the event of a pandemic it is likely that the public will be required to wear masks, especially in health care facilities, in public places. in the event of a pandemic it is likely that the public will be required to wear masks, especially in. situations where individuals need to interface with the public, eg, certain critical occupations. no statistically significant effects were found for gender, those living alone, employment, or psychological distress. concerns for self and family, has proven to be a significant factor associated with willingness to comply with protective health behaviors. subset of these have been identified in this study. the role of threat perception, anxiety, societal response (the compliance of others), media, and factors directly related to the course of the pandemic are all likely to influence public response."}
