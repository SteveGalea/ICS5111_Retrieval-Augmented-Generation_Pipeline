{"summary": "viral attachment proteins of avian coronaviruses (CoVs) interact with tissue-specific sialic acid structures. IBV and turkey coronavirus (TCoV) belong to the genus Gammacoronavirus within the order Nidovirales. TCoV causes gastrointestinal disease resulting in growth retardation or mortality of entire flocks. avian gammacoronaviruses are a cause of enteritis in guineafowl (8, 10) and quails (11), respectively. the spike glycoprotein in the viral envelope acts as the viral attachment protein. the spike protein contains two subunits, S1 and S2; while S1 mediates virus attachment, S2 initiates the fusion and internalization of the virus. Phylogenetic analysis of the S1 gene shows grouping of IBV and IBV-like viruses on the one hand. TCoV-US and GfCoV on the other hand clusters with the latter viruses. further analysis is hampered by the lack of additional sequence data. avian coronaviruses that cause enteritis use a novel glycan receptor for binding of the spike to tissues. they recognize nonsialylated lactosamine repeats (poly-LacNAc) on complex-type N-glycans. birds were humanely sacrificed at 1, 2, 3, and 7 days postinfection (dpi) necropsy was performed after an experiment at the french agency for food, environmental and  occupational heath safety (Anses) pCD5 expression vectors containing the S1 domains of TCoV-US, GfCoV, and GfCoV were transfected into human embryo kidney cells (HEK293T) pCD5 vectors containing the S1 domains of TCoV-US, GfCoV, and GfCoV were transfected into human embryo kidney cells (HEK293T) S1 proteins were precomplexed with anti-Strep-tag antibody and Alexa 647-linked anti-mouse IgG prior to incubation for 15 min on ice. subsequently mixed with polyacrylic acid (PAA)-3\u2032 LacNAc type 1 (Neu5Ac2,3Gal1,3GlcNAc-OCH2CH2CH2NH-polyacrylamide) or PAA-diLacNAc (Gal1,4Gl glycan arrays were dried by centrifugation and immediately scanned for fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) signals. for each glycan, the mean signal intensity was calculated from 6 replicates spots. the highest and lowest signals of the 6 replicates were removed. cristagalli lectin (ECA; Vector Laboratories) or Phaseolus vulgaris agglutinin (PHA; Vector Laboratories) was diluted in PBS to a concentration of 2 g/ml. the slides were washed in PBS and an avidin-biotin complex (ABC kit; Vector Laboratories) was applied for 30 min to visualize the signal. tissues from experimentally infected chickens and turkeys were fixed in 4% formalin and subsequently dehydrated, embedded in paraffin. antigen retrieval was performed by boiling sections in Tris-EDTA (pH 9.0) for 10 min at 1,100 kW in a microwave. codon-optimized sequences for both S1 genes in pUC57 with upstream NheI and downstream PacI were obtained from GenScript. pCD5 expression vector containing S1 of IBV M41 was previously described (5) and used as a control. expression and purification of proteins. S1:Strep-Tactin HRPO:PAA conjugate complexes were incubated on ice for another 30 min. sections were washed with PBS\u20130.1% Tween, and AEC was applied. the next day sections were washed with PBS\u20130.1% Tween. the 6 replicates were removed, and the remaining 4 replicates were used to calculate the mean signal, standard deviation (SD) and standard error measurement (SEM) the remaining 4 replicates were used to calculate the mean signal, standard deviation (SD) and standard error measurement. avian gammacoronaviruses IBV and TCoV-US are enteropathogenic. infected chickens showed clinical signs of respiratory disease from 4 dpi. infected turkeys showed signs of gastrointestinal disease with diarrhea, starting at 3 dpi. small intestines of turkeys infected with TCoV were stained with H&E or with an antibody against the nucleocapsid protein of TCoV. dpi, days postinfection. epithelium of chicken trachea (black arrows), inflammatory cells (arrowheads) and epithelium of turkey intestine (white arrows) are indicated. immunohistochemistry was performed by using monoclonal antibodies against the S the presence of TCoV nucleocapsid proteins was detected from days 6 to 13 postinfection in the enterocytes of the turkey small intestine. both viruses infected the epithelial cells of the target organs, defined by clinical symptoms, but the course of infection of TCoV appeared to be longer than that of IBV. protein histochemistry was performed by applying recombinant IBV M41 S1 (5) onto trachea and small intestines of chicken and turkey. in parallel, we produced S1 proteins of two other avian coronaviruses with reported gastrointestinal tract tropism, namely guineafowl (8) and quail (11) CoVs. enterotropic CoV protein still had the ability to bind to desialylated tissues. these results confirm the above-described observation that TCoV, GfCoV, and QCoV bind to host cells via a different host receptor than that used by IBV (5). the results showed that TCoV S1 recognized nonsialylated type 2 poly-LacNAc structures. TCoV S1 bound to these glycans only if the core structure was either a bi- or triantennary N-glycan. glycan binding specificity of avian coronavirus spike proteins. shown are glycan binding specificities of TCoV (A), GfCoV (B), QCoV d (C) and the plant lectins Erythrina cristagalli lectin (ECA) (D) and Phaseolus vulgaris agglutinin (PHA) (E) the avian coronavirus spike proteins were also able to bind non-PAA-conjugated LacNAc. however, the more promiscuous lectin ECA could not bind to LacNAc structures in the ELISA-like assay. however, enteric coronavirus S1 proteins show a more strict specificity for the LacNAc N-glycans. be blocked with the sialylglycopolymer containing Neu5Ac2,3Gal1,3GlcNAc. this glycan blocked IBV S1 binding to chicken trachea. these data confirm the relevance of these glycans for determining the receptor specificity of CoVs causing gastrointestinal disease. the role of diLacNAc in TCoV infection awaits further study. we applied ECA onto tissues from chicken, turkey, guineafowl, and quail. the glycan specificities of ECA and the recognition of viral receptors are reflected by broader binding of ECA to tissues. TCoV-US S1 was performed on the multispecies TMA containing intestinal tissues of various other avian species, including Canada goose, graylag goose, mallard duck, teal, partridge, pigeon, pheasant, and chicken. similar results were obtained for TCoV S1 suggesting that the availability of N-glycans with nonsialylated poly-LacNAc may predispose these avian species to infection by avian gammacoronaviruses IBV and TCoV-US are enteropathogenic. infected chickens showed clinical signs of respiratory disease from 4 dpi. infected turkeys showed signs of gastrointestinal disease with diarrhea, starting at 3 dpi. small intestines of turkeys infected with TCoV were stained with H&E or with an antibody against the nucleocapsid protein of TCoV. dpi, days postinfection. epithelium of chicken trachea (black arrows), inflammatory cells (arrowheads) and epithelium of turkey intestine (white arrows) are indicated. the presence of TCoV nucleocapsid proteins was detected from days 6 to 13 postinfection in the enterocytes of the turkey small intestine. both viruses infected the epithelial cells of the target organs, defined by clinical symptoms, but the course of infection of TCoV appeared to be longer than that of IBV. protein histochemistry was performed by applying recombinant IBV M41 S1 (5) onto trachea and small intestines of chicken and turkey. in parallel, we produced S1 proteins of two other avian coronaviruses with reported gastrointestinal tract tropism, namely, guineafowl (8) and quail (11) CoVs. enterotropic CoV protein still had the ability to bind to desialylated tissues.

TCoV S1 bound to these glycans only if the core structure was either a bi- or triantennary N-glycan. we printed diLacNAc, 2,3-linked sialylated diLacNAc, and 2,6-linked sialylated diLacNAc structures. glycan binding specificity of avian coronavirus spike proteins. shown are glycan binding specificities of TCoV (A), GfCoV (B), QCoV d (C) and the plant lectins Erythrina cristagalli lectin (ECA) (D) and Phaseolus vulgaris agglutinin (PHA) (E) avian coronavirus spike proteins were able to bind non-PAA-conjugated LacNAc. however, the more promiscuous lectin ECA could not bind to LacNAc structures in the ELISA-like assay. however, the more promiscuous lectin ECA can be used to profile galactose residues on type 2 LacNAc structures. the sialylglycopolymer containing Neu5Ac2,3Gal1,3GlcNAc (PAA-3\u2032 LacNAc) blocked IBV S1 binding to chicken trachea. these data confirm the relevance of these glycans for determining the receptor specificity of CoVs causing gastrointestinal disease. the role of diLacNAc in TCoV infection awaits further study. we applied ECA onto tissues from chicken, turkey, guineafowl, and quail. the glycan specificities of ECA and the recognition of viral receptors are reflected by broader binding of ECA to tissues. ECA and TCoV-US S1, respectively, were performed on the multispecies TMA containing intestinal tissues of various other avian species, including Canada goose, graylag goose, mallard duck, teal, partridge, pigeon, pheasant, and chicken. similar results were obtained for TCoV S1 suggesting that the availability of N-glycans with nonsialylated poly-LacNAc may predispose these avi the spike viral attachment proteins of turkey, guineafowl, and quail coronaviruses required nonsialylated type 2 poly-LacNAc structures on N-glycan cores for binding. this was in marked contrast to the sialic acid-dependent binding of avian coronaviruses that induce primarily respiratory tract disease. phylogenetic trees based on the S1 gene clearly separate respiratory from gastrointestinal avian coronaviruses. this diversity was reflected by the prominent binding of this S1 protein to the epithelium of the bursa of Fabricius and the only rather mild staining of the small intestine of turkey. further studies are needed to elucidate whether this virus uses yet another receptor for binding, and to determine its tropism, in turkeys. poly-LacNAcs are described to be an age-specific receptor for human rotavirus (28) as they are expressed predominantly in saliva of infants, neonates and young children appear to be more susceptible to diarrhea caused by human rotavirus (28). as they are expressed predominantly in saliva, neonates and young children appear to be more susceptible to diarrhea caused by human rotavirus (28) eafowl, and quail were detected (data not shown) compared to these lectins, S1 proteins of enteric CoVs recognize nonsialylated poly-LacNAc-containing N-glycans with high specificity. this strict specificity points toward the preferred use of viral attachment proteins over lectins for profiling glycans in other cells and tissues. the preference of nonsialylated poly-LacNAc-containing glycans may predispose organ systems and hosts to infection by coronaviruses."}
