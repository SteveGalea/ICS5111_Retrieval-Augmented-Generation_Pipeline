{"summary": "BACKGROUND Influenza pandemics have recurred at irregular intervals since at least the ninth century AD. deaths from influenza-associated pneumonias have repeatedly been documented. the 1918 virus was a novel \u201cfounder virus\u201d that has served as the mother of the descendant influenza A viral progeny that have been infecting and killing humans ever since. genetic sequences of viruses obtained from persons dying between May 1918 and February 1919 show little variation and no evidence of evolution toward enhanced pathogenicity. the reservoir of all influenza A viruses is the global pool of billions of wild waterfowl and shore birds, within which they and their segmented genes continually circulate and reassort. since 1918, pandemics caused by 1918-descended viruses have occurred in 1957 (referred to as H2N2 viruses after the subtypes of the HA and the neuraminidase [NA] proteins), 1968 (H3N2), and 2009 (H1N1, like its parent 1918 virus) over centuries, influenza pandemics have been variably mild (e.g., in 1510 and in the modern era in 2009) or severe (e.g., in 1557 and the 1918 mortality rate in this age range was four to five times that in the 1889 pandemic, presumably reflecting higher inherent viral pathogenicity. another determinant of 1918 pandemic severity was the unprecedented age-specific mortality (and case fatality) pattern in which young infected adults were at extraordinarily high risk of dying. lower-than-expected mortality among elderly persons in 1918 might reflect long-term exposures of that age cohort to a partially 1918-protective 1830s pandemic virus. however, declining 1918 mortality incidence in successive birth cohorts between 1889 and about 1904 could reflect a different mechanism of accumulating cohort protection associated with exposures to the new 1889 virus. in experimental studies of 1918 modern waterfowl chimeric viruses,9 contemporary waterfowl H1 gene segments confer the same degree of extreme pathogenicity as the 1918 pandemic H1. indefinite maintenance of population H1 immunity may be an important component of pandemic prevention. inherent avian H1 pathogenicity also argues against another popular myth that 1918 severity was somehow related to the disruption of World War I. 1918 pandemic mortality was attributable not to more severe complicating pneumonias but to a higher case incidence of complicating pneumonias of typical case fatality in influenza-infected persons in this age group. FUTURE PREVENTION, CONTAINMENT, AND TREATMENT We do not currently have tools to prevent the emergence of influenza pandemics. public health efforts may not stop a future pandemic, but they can potentially blunt it. instituting community prevention with public education, hand sanitation, work leave policies, school closures could also blunt future pandemics. nurses, some professionals, others untrained volunteers or family members or friends, were among the great heroes and heroines of the pandemic. a still unresolved critical problem is that progression from typical influenza to explosive bronchopneumonia may be so rapid that only very early detection and treatment can be life saving. we now have moderately effective influenza vaccines and a standing production capacity based on a reliable viral platform that can be scale up to deliver vaccine across the nation within about six months. study of past pandemics suggests importance of cumulative exposures to related viruses in designing prepandemic vaccines. a century after the world\u2019s deadliest pandemic, we are still studying it."}
