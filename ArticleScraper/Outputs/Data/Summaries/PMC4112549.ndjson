{"summary": "studies of invertebrate antiviral RNA interference (RNAi) pathways have produced powerful tools for probing and manipulating gene function. dipteran organisms, such as Drosophila melanogaster, have been the primary focus of virus-host studies in invertebrates. the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) has been one of the most prolific hardwood forest pests since its accidental release in the late 1800\u2019s. the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) has been one of the most prolific North American hardwood forest pests since its accidental release in the late 1800\u2019s. the extent of RNA virus studies in Lepidoptera is limited compared to DNA virus studies and largely restricted to non-enveloped dsRNA and (+)-sense ssRNA viruses such as cypoviruses (Hill et al., 1999), iflaviruses (van Oers, 2010) and tetraviruses (Short and Dorrington, 2012) these viruses only infect invertebrate hosts. the highly conserved, and previously uncharacterized, VACV gene product is sufficient to alleviate the LD652 cell restriction to VSV and SINV replication. using RNAi and genetic techniques, we found that the highly conserved, and previously uncharacterized, VACV A51R gene product is sufficient to alleviate the LD652 cell restriction to VSV and SINV replication. we found that an A51R point mutant with reduced RNA virus rescue ability still forms filamentous structures and stabilizes MTs. 4% of LD652 cells exhibited GFP fluorescence by 96 hr post-infection. a previous report indicated that VACV enters LD652 cells and reaches the stage of late gene expression but ultimately fails to complete virion morphogenesis. we therefore wondered if VACV co-infection might nevertheless overcome an immune response in LD652 cells that restricts RNA virus replication. Mock-infected data are identical in (C) and (D) Immunoblot of LUC, VSV M (E) or SINV E1 (F), VACV F4L, and cellular actin proteins in lysates from (C) and (D) 72 hpi. arbitrary light units were collected for 72 hr post RNA virus infection. fold change was calculated by dividing LU obtained from each co-infection condition by LU obtained from cells infected with VSV-LUC or SINV-LUC in the absence of VACV-WR. data represent means (+SEM). VSV-LUC and SINV-LUC titers from LD652 cultures also reflected LUC activity, remaining unchanged over time in single infections but increasing during VACV-WR co-infection. together these data indicate that RNA virus restriction occurs post-entry. highest dose (0.1 g/ml) reduced cell viability by 50% after 48 hr of treatment. results suggest that host cell transcription is required for LD652 resistance to RNA virus infection and that LD652 cells express antiviral immunity factors. LD652 cells were transfected with the indicated dsRNAs for 24 hr. in parallel experiments, uninfected cells were transfected with p166 vector encoding LUC (p166-LUC) and each indicated dsRNA. cells were collected 48 hpi/transfection and analyzed for LUC activity. data are plotted as fold change in LU when compared to LU generated in empty vector transfection treatments. Ub-RPL40 and Ub-RPS27A encode highly conserved fusion proteins that are cleaved by endogenous proteases into free Ub and either ribosomal protein L40 (RPL40) or ribosomal protein S27A (RPS27A), components of the 60S and 40S ribosomal subunits. the dramatic effect of Ub RNAi on LUC expression in VSV-LUC-infected cells was next sought to identify the VACV gene(s) responsible for relieving the LD652 restriction to RNA virus infection. we co-infected LD652 cells with VSV or SINV and a heat-inactivated strain of VACV expressing the late A5L core protein fused to GFP. heat inactivated VACV failed to rescue VSV and SINV replication. fold change in LU was calculated as in (A) lysates from cells infected with VSV-LUC (C) or SINV-LUC (D) and in presence of AraC for 72 hr. modified VACV Ankara (VACV-MVA) failed to fully rescue either VSV or SINV as compared to either VACV-WR or Copenhagen strains. arbitrary cut off of 50% of control (GFP) RNAi treatment. A51R knockdown reduced virus gene expression by 95% (VSV) and by 69% (SINV) RNA interference (RNAi) assay in LD652 cells to identify VACV-encoded determinants of SINV rescue. L. dispar cells were treated as described in the legend for Figure 4A,B. VSV was rescued by co-infecting with revertant VACV strains. co-infection with A51R resulted in a 100-fold reduction in VSV gene expression relative to co-infection with VACV-WR. we found that the J2R/A51RFMVAA51R strain failed to fully rescue VSV. lysates from a time course of A51RFA51R infection confirmed that Flag-A51R is expressed early in VACV infection. however, we noticed that other VACV factors in addition to A51R promote SINV replication in LD652 cells. ts confirmed similar levels of Flag-GFP and Flag-A51R expression in these lysates. the stronger A51R-dependent rescue of VSV compared to SINV led us to focus on VSV infection assays. we then tested if VSV replication affected LD652 cell viability over a 7 day course.

A51R relieves RNA virus restriction in multiple lepidopteran hosts. fold changes in LU are relative to LU obtained from VSV-LUC (8 hpi) lysates. fold change in LU are relative to LU obtained from Flag-GFP (8 hpi) lysates. lysates were blotted for VSV M, VACV I3L, and actin proteins. lysates were blotted for VSV M, VACV I3L, and actin proteins. flag-A51R formed both aggregate-like as well as filamentous structures in the cytoplasm of African green monkey-derived (BSC-40) cells. this staining pattern significantly overlapped with that of cellular tubulin, suggesting that A51R associates with a subset of MTs. we observed enhanced co-localization on A51R-dependent, drug-resistant MT structures in infected cells treated with the MT-depolymerizing drug nocodazole we transfected BSC-40 cells with a plasmid expressing Flag-A51R. we found that flag-A51R expression was sufficient for localization to and stabilization of MTs. we found that A51R homologs from other poxviruses also co-localize with and protect MTs from depolymerization by the MT-depolymerizing agent vincristine. methanol fixed 8 hpi for confocal microscopy analysis using antibodies against Flag (red) and tubulin (green) DAPI staining (blue) was also used to mark nuclear and viral DNA in merged images. cells were infected with the indicated strains (MOI = 3) and then paraformaldehyde-fixed 8 hpi. cells were stained with antibodies against flag (red) and tubulin (green) DAPI staining (blue) was included in merge images. both Flag-A51R and Flag-A51RR321A formed filamentous structures that overlapped with tubulin staining. this results suggest that MT stabilization alone is insufficient to promote full RNA virus rescue. multiple alignments were performed using eBioX software (v. 1.5.1) using T-COFFEE alignment parameters. CPXV, cowpox virus; ECTV, ectromelia virus; DPXV, deerpox virus; and Yaba-like disease virus. we transfected LD652 cells with either empty vector or with Flag-A51R expression vector. we matched peptides identified in these LD652 cell immunoprecipitates to Flag-A51R sequence as well as to the available Bombyx mori proteome. the majority of A51R associated with insoluble cell fractions makes direct immunoblot analysis of immunoprecipitated materials impossible. e supplement 1) enhances RNA virus gene expression in L. dispar cells. we used a two hour pulse of [35S]methionine to label newly-synthesized proteins in virus-infected LD652 cells. we then analyzed the abundance of newly synthesized, radiolabeled VSV N protein. the levels of radiolabeled protein appeared to diminish more rapidly during co-infection with VACV-WR. the half-life of VSV N was 5.3 hr during co-infection with VACV-WR while only 1.8 hr during co-infection with the A51R strain. a51R promotes RNA virus protein stability in LD652 cells. lysates containing radiolabeled VSV N protein from VACV-WR and A51R co-infections time courses (B) were processed separately. data represent means (+SD). p0.05 indicates a statistically significant difference between infection group tissue titers. each dot indicates the total virus titers from an individual mouse. cell culture medium containing 1000 U/ml recombinant IFN- or normal growth medium (control) was used to replace growth medium of cells 16 hr prior to infection with indicated viruses (MOI = 0.03) after 24 of infection, total virus titers were determined by plaque assay as in (C) despite 10-fold lower titers of total (intracellular and extracellular) virus in A51R cultures than in VACV-WR or A51RFA51R cultures, A51R cultures shed twofold higher levels of EEV than in VACV-WR or A51RFA51R cultures. by day 6, however, a trend toward lower A51R titers in the lungs was observed. we found that IFN pre-treatment reduced VACV-WR and A51RFA51R titers by 10-fold by 24 hpi relative to control treatment. titers were similarly reduced at this time point, suggesting that loss of A51R does not make VACV more susceptible to the antiviral effects of IFN. LD652 cells were co-infected with VSV-GFP or SINV-GFP. the number of GFP-positive cells increased to 77% (VSV-GFP) and 45% (SINV-GFP) by 96 hpi. VSV N (A) and SINV E1 (B) virion protein staining inside LD652 cells by confocal microscopy 24 hpi. scale bars represent 10 m. RT-PCR assay of VSV (+)-sense transcription and cellular actin mRNA levels in LD652 cells at the indicated times post-infection. effect of timing of VACV-WR co-infection on VSV-LUC (E) or SINV single infections still produced LU levels 10-fold above mock-infected cells by 24 hpi. co-infection of VSV-LUC or SINV-LUC with VACV-WR yielded LU levels similar to those seen in single infection by 8 hpi. however, LU readings increased logarithmically by 24\u201348 hpi. we detected VSV and SINV capsids inside singly-infected LD652 cells. at 8 hpi RT-PCR analysis of VSV- and SINV-infected cells detected similar level of viral transcripts with or without VACV-WR co-infection. together these data indicate that RNA virus restriction occurs post-entry. LD652 cells were transfected with the indicated dsRNAs for 24 hr. uninfected cells were transfected with a p166 vector encoding LUC (p166-LUC) along with each indicated dsRNA. apoptosis induction in LD652 cells is due to apoptosis induction. LD652 cells were transfected with empty pIZ/His-V5 vector (EV) or the catalytic mutant form PLproC112A for 24 hr followed by infection with the indicated viruses. data are plotted as fold change in LU when compared to LU generated in control medium treatments. dsRNAs targeting luc sequences increased LUC expression 10-fold in VSV-LUC- and SINV-LUC-infected cells. the dramatic effect of Ub RNAi on LUC expression in VSV-LUC-infected cells was not caused by increased LUC protein stability due to inhibition of the Ub-proteasome system. the findings suggest that host restriction of RNA virus replication in LD652 cells is mediated by multiple host factors including those involved in RNAi-, NF-B, and Ub-related pathways. heat inactivated VACV failed to rescue VSV and SINV replication. we confirmed that AraC treatments blocked late VACV gene expression by immunoblotting for A5L-GFP in the absence or presence of AraC. we found that inhibiting post-replicative VACV gene expression did not prevent rescue of either VSV or SINV. RNAi of a single, uncharacterized VACV gene, A51R, reduced virus gene expression by 95% (VSV) and by 69% (SINV) RNAi knockdown reduced virus gene expression by 95% (VSV) and by 69% (SINV) SV-LUC (C) or SINV-LUC (D) in the presence of AraC (200 g/ml) for 72 hr. fold change in LU are relative to LU obtained from empty vector treatment. cell viability after VSV infection measured by trypan blue exclusion assay. arose gel showing RT-PCR analysis of A51R, I3L, and actin mRNA expression in recombinant VACV strains 24 hpi in LD652 cells. arose gel showing RT-PCR analysis of A51R, I3L, and actin mRNA expression in recombinant VACV strains. expressing a Flag-tagged gene (Flag-A51R) reintroduced into either the A51R locus (A51RFA51R) or the VACV thymidine kinase locus (J2R/A51RFA51R) we reverted the A51R strain with a Flag-tagged form of the VACV-MVA A51R gene (Flag-MVAA51R) gene. we cloned Flag-A51R into a p166 expression vector and transfected LD652 cells. only 40\u201360% of cells expressed detectable Flag-A51R protein. however, we observed an 60-fold increase in VSV and 12-fold increase in SINV gene expression. this reduced cell viability was not observed when flag-GFP-transfected cells were infected with VSV-LUC. active viral replication was required to induce cell death. A51R genes are found in most vertebrate poxvirus genera. but absent in the genomes of entomopoxviruses. NPV Unclassified \u2013 CRV * VACV strains MVA (Antoine et al., 1998) and Dryvax (Qin et al., 2011) contain a fragmented A51R gene. \u2018+\u2019 Indicates presence, and \u2018\u2018 indicates absence of A51R gene in viral genomes within each genus. the ability of a vertebrate poxvirus to rescue VSV replication in LD652 cells was so unexpected that we asked whether other cell lines from L. dispar or other Lepidopteran species similarly restrict VSV replication. we found that A51R expression relieved restriction to VSV replication in each of the additional Lepidopteran cell lines tested. fold change in LU was calculated by dividing LU in Flag-A51R treatments with LU in Flag-GFP treatments. cells were transfected with p166 vectors encoding Flag-A51R or Flag-GFP and infected with VSV-LUC (MOI = 0.1) A51R expression did not enhance VSV replication in D. melanogaster-derived DL1 cells. if Drosophila cells do have restrictions targeted by A51R, these restrictions are not sufficient to measurably check VSV replication in these experiments. MT structures were absent in mock-infected and A51R-infected cells. however filamentous, drug-resistant \u2018MT pieces\u2019 were abundant in A51RFA51R-infected BSC-40 cells. flag-MVAA51R expression was sufficient for both localization to and stabilization of MTs. Poxvirus A51R proteins localize with and stabilize host microtubules. arrows indicate A51R filaments and arrowheads indicate A51R aggregate structures that overlap with tubulin staining. scale bars represent 10 m. nocodazole-resistant, MT-like filamentous tubulin pieces are only observed in VACV-infected cells when Flag-A51R is also present. coverslips were then methanol-fixed and processed for confocal microscopy using flag (red), VACV (magenta), and tubulin (green) antibodies. DAPI staining (blue) was also used to mark DNA in merged images. alanine substitution of residue R321, which lies within the C-terminal region of A51R that is missing in VACV-MVA A51R (Figure 8A), produced a suitable mutant for analysis. MT stabilization alone is insufficient to promote full RNA virus rescue. 0.019 A merge between Flag (red) and tubulin (green) staining is shown. your browser is not supporting the HTML5 video> element. you may download that video as a file and play it with a player of you choice. flag-A51R/A51RR321A (red) and tubulin (green) proteins in LD652 cells in presence of vincristine 48 hr post-transfection of Flag-A51R vectors. Arrows indicate A51R filaments that overlap with tubulin staining. previous results suggested that A51R may provide functions, beyond MT stabilization, that promote RNA virus replication. proteins most-enriched in Flag-A51R immunoprecipitates from LD652 cells DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02910.021 Protein No. of spectral counts NSAF (NSAFFlag-A51R-NSAFControl) Myosin II essential light chain 110 0.0355 Ub 21 0.0113 Flag-A51R 33 0.0066 Ribosomal protein S15 18 0.0056 Ribosomal protein viral protein translation rates are too low to be detected in VSV-LUC single infections. however, total VSV N protein levels were dramatically reduced in A51R co-infections compared to co-infections with VACV-WR. levels of radiolabeled protein appeared to diminish more rapidly during co-infection. immunoprecipitated complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. lysates containing radiolabeled VSV N protein from VACV-WR and A51R co-infections time courses (B) were processed separately. p0.05 indicates a statistically significant difference in survival between VACV-WR- and A51R strain-infected animals. p0.05 indicates a statistically significant difference between infection group tissue titers. groups of 5 NMRI mice were intranasally-inoculated with the indicated doses of either VACV-WR (A) or A51R (B) strains. percentage survival of these groups of mice was tracked over the indicated time course. in animals infected with VACV-WR, weight loss continued on days 6\u20137 post-infection, with 5/5 animals ultimately succumbing to infection by day 7. only 1/5 animals infected with the A51R strain died by day 7, while the remaining animals recovered from infection gained weight. reduced replication of the A51R strain during in vitro and in vivo infections was not caused by a reduction in the extracellular enveloped form of VACV. despite 10-fold lower titers of total (intracellular and extracellular) virus in A51R cultures than in VACV-WR or A51RFA51R cultures, A51R cultures shed twofold higher levels of EEV than in VACV-WR or A51RFA51R cultures. mRNA-seq-based transcriptome data, combined with RNAi knockdowns studies, allowed us to identify host cell immunity factors that restrict RNA virus replication. we also used an RNAi screen to identify A51R as a poxvirus factor that overcomes Lepidopteran immunity to virus infection. despite promiscuous host ranges in both vertebrates and invertebrates, VSV and SINV were completely restricted in LD652 cells. a role for AGO2 and Dicer-2 in lepidopteran restriction to RNA virus replication is consistent with the deep conservation of RNAi-based antiviral immunity in vertebrates and invertebrates. transient expression of the nodamura virus B2 protein rescues VSV and SINV replication in multiple Lepidopteran cell lines. Activation of Relish requires a series of ubiquitination reactions. homologs of Relish, Effete and Ub all function to restrict VSV and SINV replication in L. dispar cells. however, the mechanism by which viruses are recognized by this pathway is still unknown. we were surprised by the rescue of VSV and SINV replication in LD652 cells by VACV. this is the first example of heterologous virus rescue by a vertebrate virus in an invertebrate host. in mammalian cell culture, VACV also enhances VSV replication. but the VACV-encoded IFN response antagonists E3L and B18R are the major determinants of this rescue. truncated VACV-MVA A51R protein fails to form filamentous, nocodazole-resistant MT structures. truncated VACV-MVA A51R protein fails to form filamentous, nocodazole-resistant MT structures. the presence or absence of functional A51R could explain why the nocodazole-resistant \u2018MT pieces\u2019 previously observed in VACV-infected cells were not observed in uninfected or VACV-MVA-infected cells. previous studies implicate MTs in promoting VSV and SINV gene expression and tubulin has been shown to promote VSV RNA polymerase activity in vitro. antiviral responses by perturbing MT-dependent transport of host factors and/or organelles. Previously it has been shown that VACV-WR infection causes redistribution of endosomes from dispersed cytosolic locations to large perinuclear clusters. this suggests that outward, MT-dependent endosomal trafficking might be impaired during VACV infection. the release of EEV is MT-dependent (Ploubidou et al., 2000), and EEV is known to elicit neutralizing antibodies. thus it is possible that A51R attenuates virion transport along MTs. Interestingly, the Dryvax strain of VACV encodes a fragmented A51R gene. the unexpected uncoupling of RNA virus restriction by A51R has provided an exciting new arena to explore virus-host interactions. chemicals X-gal, nocodazole, vincristine, PYR-41, and MG132 were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, Mo) and dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide. L.dispar-derived embryonic embryonic (LdEP) cells were obtained from the United States Department of Agriculture Research Service. S. frugiperda-derived Sf9 cells were obtained from Invitrogen. VACV stocks were amplified in BSC-40 cells with the exception of VACV-MVA which was passaged in BHK cells. Viruses were collected from culture supernatants by ultracentrifugation (25,000 rpm, 2 hr, 4\u00b0C) and titrated by plaque assay. recombinant viruses were generated using previously described methods. plasmid pZIPPY-NEO/GUS was used to clone 500 bp PCR product.
