{"summary": "WNV is a member of the Japanese encephalitis serogroup within the genus Flaviviridae (1). it contains a single-stranded plus-strand RNA genome that harbors one open reading frame encoding three structural and seven non-structural (NS) proteins. it replicates and accumulates in birds and spreads to new hosts via mosquitoes. no vaccine has been approved for human use (5) leaving current prevention efforts focused entirely on mosquito control (6). there is a demand for a drug effective for treatment of WNV-related diseases. programmed 1 ribosomal frameshifts direct a fraction of translating ribosomes to shift one base in the 5\u2032 direction. a slippery site is a heptameric sequence on which frameshifting can occur while maintaining non-wobble base pairing between tRNAs in the ribosomal A- and P-sites with the mRNA. 1 PRF signal is localized in the WNV genome so frameshift events prevent production of NS proteins. increased frameshifting resulted in decreased ratios of structural/non-structural proteins (E/NS5 ratio) and decreased virus production (11). the h442 strain (accession number EF429200) caused an outbreak of disease in birds in 1978. the h442 strain (accession number EF429200) is one of the few lineage 2 strains associated with human disease. the predicted 1 PRF signal sequences identified in the Recode Database (16) are limited to 75 nucleotides in length, and secondary structures are predicted using mfold (17), a program that cannot predict complex RNA structures such as pseudoknots. these suggested that additional 3\u2032 sequence information may participate in downstream 1 PRF stimulatory structures. thus, the 129-nucleotide long sequences shown in Fig. 1B derived from the new york, Kunjin, Madagascar, and mutated frameshift signals showed a near complete loss of firefly luciferase expression. at least three technical replicates were performed on multiple biological replicates for each sample. at least three biological replicates were performed on multiple biological replicates for each sample. four biological replicates were performed in triplicate. a prior report suggested that the WNV 1PRF signals were entirely encoded within shorter 75-nucleotide long sequences (15). a head to head comparison of the new york versus Madagascar 1 PRF signals revealed both the short and long versions promoted statistically significant greater levels of frameshifting. substitution of the UCCUUUU slippery site into the Madagascar WNV sequence promoted significantly increased rates of 1 PRF relative to the wild-type frameshift signal (Fig. 2D). synthetic \u201cshort\u201d and \u201clong\u201d form RNA transcripts of the New York and Madagascar strains of the WNV 1 PRF signals were treated with 1M7. the different 3\u2032 sequences among all four strains suggested that there may be a significant amount of structural diversity among the various 1 PRF signals. SHAPE analysis was also performed on the long versions of 1 PRF signals derived from the Kunjin and h442 strains. colored arcs link base pairs, and each stem is represented by a unique color. annotations are the same as described in the legend to Fig. 3. The WNV Sequences Encode Bona Fide 1 PRF signals The predicted 1 PRF signal sequences identified in the Recode Database (16) are limited to 75 nucleotides in length. the full-length sequences shown in Fig. 1B were cloned into dual luciferase reporters, as well as three additional series of mutant versions of the frameshift signals that were created as controls. mutated frameshift signals showed a near complete loss of firefly luciferase expression. ourlip controls, 3. Kunjin WT, 7; Kunjin Stop-ss, 8; Kunjin ss-Stop, 4. Mad Stop-ss, ss-Stop, and noslip, 4 each. at least three biological replicates were performed in triplicate. the new york strain CCCUUUU slippery site conforms to the canonical XXXYYYZ slippery site (22). in contrast, the Madagascar UCCUUU slippery site is non-canonical, although it does allow for G-U base pairing between the P-site tRNA and the 1 frame codon upon slippage. autoradiograms of denaturing polyacrylamide gels were scored for reactivity of 1M7 versus untreated control RNAs. SHAPE data were combined with computational predictions to create two-dimensional models of the folded structures. the short forms of both 1 PRF signals form similar stem-loop structures. the slippery sites are contained in the first seven bases of each of the linear sequences. the tandem stem-loop solutions are drawn above the linear sequences. in the long sequence versions, the tandem stem-loop solutions are drawn above the linear sequences. cleotides were analyzed by three programs capable of identifying pseudoknotted RNAs: Pknots (18), NUPACK (19), and HotKnots (20) these suggested that additional 3\u2032 sequence information may participate in the downstream 1 PRF stimulatory structures. thus, the 129-nucleotide long sequences shown in Fig. 1B derived from the new york, Kunjin, Madagascar, and h442 strains were cloned into the dual at least three technical replicates were performed on multiple biological replicates for each experiment. the results provide strong genetic support for the hypothesis that the WNV-derived sequences direct highly efficient levels of 1 PRF. shorter sequences (NY Short and Madagascar Short) were compared using the dual luciferase assay. a head to head comparison of the new york versus Madagascar 1 PRF signals revealed both the short and long versions promoted statistically significant greater levels of frameshifting than those derived from the Madagascar strain. synthetic \u201cshort\u201d and \u201clong\u201d form RNA transcripts of the new york and Madagascar strains of the WNV 1 PRF signals were treated with 1M7. SHAPE analyses indicated that the short forms of both 1 PRF signals form similar stem-loop structures. SHAPE analysis was performed on the long versions of 1 PRF signals derived from the Kunjin and h442 strains. this analysis revealed significant structural diversity in the 1 PRF signals of the four strains. each autoradiogram includes sequencing lanes, control (), and test (+) lanes. ural analyses of the long versions of the WNV h442 (panels A and C) and Kunjin (panels B and D) 1 PRF signals are the same as described in the legend to Fig. 3. the predicted 1 PRF signal sequences identified in the Recode Database (16) are limited to 75 nucleotides in length, and secondary structures are predicted using mfold (17), a program that cannot predict complex RNA structures such as pseudoknots. sites to ACTGACT were constructed to validate 1 PRF through the canonical mechanism. sites harboring termination codons in the zero frame 5\u2032 of the slippery sites were used to control for the presence of cryptic promoters. a head to head comparison of the new york versus Madagascar 1 PRF signals revealed both the short and long versions of the new york-derived sequence promoted greater levels of frameshifting than those derived from the Madagascar strain. in contrast, the Madagascar UCCUUU slippery site is non-canonical. substitution of the CCCUUUU slippery site into the Madagascar WNV sequence promoted significantly increased rates of 1 PRF relative to the wild-type frameshift signal. synthetic \u201cshort\u201d and \u201clong\u201d form RNA transcripts of the New York and Madagascar strains of the WNV 1 PRF signals were treated with 1M7, and subject to SHAPE analyses. the short forms of both 1 PRF signals form similar stem-loop structures. the long versions of the WNV new york and Madagascar 1 PRF signals appeared to be able to assume at least two distinct and mutually exclusive structures. SHAPE analysis was also performed on the long versions of 1 PRF signals derived from the Kunjin and h442 strains. mRNA pseudoknots are more difficult for ribosomes to resolve than the stem-loops observed in shorter sequences. mRNA pseudoknots are more difficult to resolve than the stem-loops observed in shorter sequences, resulting in longer ribosomal stalling. SHAPE analyses revealed a greater degree of RNA structural variation than previously predicted among the 1 PRF promoting mRNA pseudoknots of the different WNV strains. this is likely due to the greater number of sequence differences toward the 3\u2032 ends of the signals, which were not included in earlier computational predictions. the tandem stem-loops first may be formed co-transcriptionally, and that the more complex structure is folded post-transcriptionally. this is consistent with the structure formed by the shorter sequences. this is consistent with the structure formed by the shorter sequences. WNV can be viewed as a prototype for emerging Flaviviruses in the western hemisphere, including the Zika virus. emerging Alphaviruses, e.g. Chikungunya, and the Equine Encephalitis viruses also utilize 1 PRF (16) a deeper understanding of how RNA structural dynamics control 1 PRF and gene expression may contribute towards understanding how to disrupt the process. all other sequences were cloned into p2luci using the Gibson Assembly method. primers were designed with at least 15 nucleotide overlaps with each other and the template. all plasmids were amplified in Escherichia coli strain DH5. cells were transfected with 1100 ng of plasmid and 3.3 l of FuGene reagent in 1 ml of DMEM+++ and grown overnight in 12-well plates. p2luci was employed as the in-frame control. primers were labeled with [-32P]ATP and T4 DNA kinase at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min. labeled primers were purified using Sephadex 25 spin columns. 1M7- and DMSO-treated RNAs were denatured at 65 \u00b0C for 5 min. synthetic forward and reverse primers containing overlaps of at least 20 nucleotides were designed to include BamHI and SalI restriction endonuclease recognition sites. primers were extended and amplified from full-length clones (kindly provided by Dr. Brenda Fredericksen) by PCR using the DreamTaq Master Mix (Life Technologies) a 0-frame UAA termination codon in the 1 frame immediately after the slippery site to control for the presence of cryptic promoters. a substitution of the non-slippery ACTGACT sequence for the wild-type slippery sequences to verify that slippage was dependent on the slippery sequences. transfected HeLa cells were used to control for background levels of luminescence. 1 PRF efficiencies were calculated as the ratio of firefly to Renilla luciferase reads. cDNA synthesis continued at 45 \u00b0C for 10 min. cDNAs and parallel sequencing reactions were separated through 8% polyacrylamide urea denaturing gels. radiolabeled cDNAs were visualized using a Typhoon phosphorimager.
