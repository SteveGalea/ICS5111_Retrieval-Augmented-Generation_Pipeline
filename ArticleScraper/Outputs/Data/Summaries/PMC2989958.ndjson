{"summary": "dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3 grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) plays important role in the susceptibility to various infectious diseases. the aim of this study is to ascertain the potential involvement of DC-SIGN promoter single nucleotide polymorphisms in NPC susceptibility. nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is rare in most populations around the world. it is common in china and Southeast Asia, where the incidence can reach 20 to 50 per 100,000 individuals [1-5] there is a dose-response relationship between EBV antibodies and NPC risk. s in the susceptibility to or pathogenesis of various infectious diseases, such as dengue fever [25,28], tuberculosis [13,14,29,30], celiac disease [34]. s in the susceptibility to or pathogenesis of various infectious diseases, such as dengue fever [25,28], tuberculosis [13,14,29,30], AIDS [19,31-33]. venous blood specimens totalling 5-10 ml were collected from subjects. genomic DNA was then extracted from the lymphocytes using the QIAamp DNA Blood Midi Kit (Qiagen, German) the manufacturer's protocol was reviewed and approved by the human ethics approval committee of SYSUCC. the amplified products were analysed by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis followed by ethidium bromide staining. PCR products were recovered, and further purified using the 3730 automated sequencer. chi-square test or Fisher's exact test was used to compare the genotype frequencies between cases and controls. study subjects All subjects were unrelated Cantonese population in Guangzhou, China. cases were recruited consecutively from December 2005 to October 2006. population controls were cancer-free individuals, randomly selected from individuals who attend annual community-based physical examinations during the same period. primer 2 delimits promoter region between nt -404 and nt -1041 and amplifies a 638 bp fragment. PCR amplification was performed in a volume of 20 L. a chi-square test or Fisher's exact test was used to compare the genotypic and allelic distribution between cases and controls. the analyses were performed in SPSS software for Windows, version 13.0 (SPSS) 0.78 Female 173 (39.0) 185 (39.9) Age(%), mean SD (y) 41.7 9.6 41.3 10.6 30 49 (11.0) 61(13.1) 0.71 31-40 163 (36.7) 158 (34.1) 41-50 162 (36.5) 163 (35.2) 51-60 51 (11.5) 60 (12.9) 61 19 (4.3) 22 (4.8) Level of education Illiteracy or primary school 94 (21.7) 37 (8.0) 0.001 High school 7718587 A/G Promoter 0.003 1.00 100.0 5 DC-SIGN -871 rs4804803 7718733 A/G Promoter 0.085 0.96 100.0 5 DC-SIGN -871 rs735239 7719268 A/G 5'flanking 0.154 0.58 100.0 5 DC-SIGN -871 rs735239 7719268 A/G 5'flanking 0.154 0.58 100.0 subjects carrying mutant genotype -939 AA had 2.56-fold increased risk of developing NPC compared to those carrying allele -139 A (P = 0.001) the association between the risk allele -939 A and NPC susceptibility was statistically significant (OR = 1.43; 95% CI = 1.15-1.79; P = 0.002) association between DC-SIGN promoter variants and NPC SNP Genotype Case Control UnadjustedOR (95% CI)* Unadjusted P-value # DC-SIGN -116 GG 440 457 ref ref GT 4 7 0.59(0.17-2.04) 0.40 0.57 (0.16-2.01) 0.38 TT 0 0 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- h1 'AAAG' represents wild-type for all four common SNPs (-139 A, -336 A, -871 A and -939 G) 68.4% of all haplotypes was associated with protection against NPC. h2 'GAGA' accounts for 14.1% of all haplotypes. the association between DC-SIGN Haplotypes and NPC risk Hap Block HaploFreq Case Ratios Control Ratios Chisq OR (95% CI) P-value* EMP h1 AAAG 0.684 0.643 0.723 13.6 0.69 (0.57-0.84) 2.0 10-4 0.001 h2 GAGA. h1 'AAAG' contains all four wild-type SNPs (-139 A, -336 A, -871 A and -939 G) was associated with a significantly decreased risk of NPC. h2 'GAGA' was significantly associated with the NPC phenotype. in current study, the allelic frequency of DC-SIGN -332 A was 10.7%. a protein expressed on the surface of DCs has recently received considerable attention in research on AIDS [33], dengue [25,35], tuberculosis [29,30] and Ulcerative Colitis [39]. it may mainly due to the location of the DC-SIGN -336 SNP 214 bp upstream of the major transcription site, affecting a Sp1-like binding site and further modulating DC-SIGN transcriptional activity. DC-SIGN -139 is located close to one of the binding sites of the transcription factor AP-1 in the promoter region of DC-SIGN. it is yet to be determined whether this variant will affect the expression of DC-SIGN. no studies have been performed to determine whether DC-SIGN is the EBV receptor. the current study represents the first comprehensive genetic association study examining the relationship between DC-SIGN promoter genetic variants and NPC risk in a case-control study. authors declare that they have no competing interests. all authors read and approved the final manuscript. prepub Acknowledgements This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 30630068 and 30972762)"}
