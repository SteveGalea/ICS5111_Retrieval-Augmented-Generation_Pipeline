{"summary": "filine coronaviruses (FCoVs) are enveloped viruses with a large, capped, polyadenylated RNA genome of about 29,190 nucleotides. other members of this subgroup include transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), canine coronavirus (CCV), raccoon dog coronavirus (RDCoV), and Chinese ferret badger coronavirus (CFBCoV) phylogenetic analyses revealed that sequences of the M and 7b genes in viruses obtained from healthy cats were distinct from those obtained from sick cats. however, genetic differences in the 7b gene were not correlated with pathogenicity in another study. the relationship between virulence and macrophage/monocyte tropism has been established. s are highly infectious and spread predominantly by the faecal-oral route. Diagnosis of FCoV FECV infections are usually associated with mild disease at most. in young kittens mild transient diarrhoea of several days duration is generally the only sign. a typical history of FIP cases includes acquisition of the cat from a cattery and a fever that waxes and wanes and does not improve with antimicrobial therapy. most commonly, kittens are infected between the ages of 6 and 8 weeks. in the \u201cwet\u201d form, the most characteristic sign is a considerable amount of intracavitary effusion (Figure 1). radiographs can reveal pleural, pericardial, or peritoneal effusion and hepatomegaly or renomegaly. meenteric lymphadenopathy may result in abdominal lesions in some cats. most consistent finding in FIP is an increase in total serum protein concentration. the concentrations of APPs such as feline 1-acid glycoprotein (fAGP) and serum amyloid A (SAA) can be measured and facilitate the diagnosis. high levels of fAGP (>1.5 g/L) and SAA in plasma or effusions can indicate FIP and may be useful supportive tests. antibodies in serum are useful diagnostic tools for detection of FCoV infection. some cats with the wet form of FIP have low titres or even no antibodies against FCoV. some cats with the wet form of FIP have low titres or even no antibodies. the utility of this assay is limited because the positive predictive value of the test is not high. some used primers targeted at conserved regions of the viral genome. some RT-PCR assays have targeted the S gene to differentiate the FCoV serotypes. can-ahna et al. (2007) found the specificity of the assay using same primers to be poor. but the different RNA extraction kits used in these studies may have affected the quality of the template RNA and the RT-PCR outcome. liver (48%) and spleen (42.3%) samples appear more likely to contain detectable FCoV than the kidneys (21.1%). RT-PCR results should be interpreted in conjunction with the clinical status of the cat. there are no pathognomonic clinical signs or specific laboratory tests for FIP in cats. no pathognomonic clinical signs or specific laboratory tests for FIP in cats."}
