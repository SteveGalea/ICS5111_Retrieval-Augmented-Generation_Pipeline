{"summary": "type I IFNs act in an autocrine and paracrine manner to switch on hundreds of target genes which contribute to anti-viral innate immunity. they also promote adaptive immune responses by priming T helper cells and cytotoxic T cells [2] 16 signal to cause type I IFN production, while AIM2 activates the inflammasome leading to processing of pro-interleukin (IL)-1 and release of IL-1 [9], [11], [12], [15]. RNA polymerase III is unusual in that it does not signal directly in response to DNA, but instead transcribes AT-rich DNA into RNA species, which are then recognized by RIG-I [8], [10] a related transcription factor of the IRF family, IRF7, plays an important role in anti-viral responses. IRF7 is present at low levels in most cells, but is induced by type I IFNs in a positive feedback loop. a functional type I IFN response provides a potent means of controlling virus infections. viruses have evolved numerous counter-measures to stop the production or action of IFNs or IFN-induced anti-viral proteins. these strategies include blockage of antiviral PRR signalling pathways. a functional screen was used to identify VACV proteins that inhibit the induction of the type I IFN response after PRR activation. in this paper we demonstrate that C6 inhibits the activation of IRF3 and IRF7 downstream of the kinases TBK1 and IKK. recombinant viruses that do not express C6 are attenuated in vivo compared to the wild type and revertant viruses. expression of C6 inhibited the activation of the IFN- promoter by transfected poly(dA-dT) or poly(IC) in HEK293 cells. also inhibited poly(IC)-induced IFN- promoter activation in mouse NIH3T3 cells. NIH3T3 cells were transfected with an IFN--promoter firefly luciferase reporter plasmid, a renilla luciferase transfection control and a renilla luciferase transfection control. cells were stimulated by transfection with 800 ng poly(IC) per well, and stimulated by infection with Sendai virus 24 h after transfection. HEK293T cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing GFP-tagged C6 or a control plasmid expressing GFP for 16 h. the cells were then infected with Sendai virus for 6 h or stimulated with IL-1 for 15 min. the presence of GFP-tagged C6 did not affect the extent of p65 nuclear translocation. HEK293 cells were transfected with a firefly luciferase reporter plasmid. they were treated with 40 ng/ml TNF- or 20 ng/ml IL-1 for 8 h. eight hours after transfection cells were treated with 25 g/ml poly(IC) for 16 h. HEK293T cells transfected with V5-tagged C6 or V5-tagged GFP were infected with Sendai virus for 6 h, fixed and stained for IRF3. in approximately 30% of cells expressing V5-tagged GFP, the translocation of IRF3 was impaired. this indicates that the inhibition of promoter induction by C6 is due to the prevention of the activation and/or nuclear translocation of IRF3. HEK293 cells were seeded in 96-well plates, transfected with a pFR-firefly luciferase reporter plasmid under the control of the Gal4 promoter, a renilla luciferase transfection control, and an IRF3-Gal4 fusion plasmid. expression vector (50, 100 or 150 ng, wedges) and empty vector (EV) were co-transfected per well a luciferase-based assay was used to measure phosphorylation-dependent transactivation activity of IRF3. a fusion protein consisting of the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 and the transactivation domain of IRF3 induces expression of a luciferase reporter gene under the control of a Gal4-dependent promoter. the ectopic expression of signalling proteins that act upstream of IRF3 activation was used to drive the as C6 was unable to prevent the activation of the ISRE by over-expression of constitutively active IRF3 (Figure 3F) C6 inhibits the activation of IRF7 by TBK1- and IKK-dependent pathways IRF7 is a transcription factor that is structurally and functionally related to IRF3. HEK293 cells expressing TLR8 were stimulated with 2.5 g/ml CL075 or 1 M R848 for 16 h. HEK293 cells expressing TLR8 were stimulated with 2.5 g/ml CL075 or 1 M R848 for 16 h. control of an ISRE element, a renilla luciferase transfection control, and a renilla luciferase transfection control. the ISRE was driven by co-transfection of 2 ng of IRF7-4D. in all cases, cells were harvested 24 h after the first transfection. HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged proteins. no interaction with TBK1 or IKK was detected. a reciprocal immunoprecipitation using lysates from cells over-expressing Streptavidin-tagged C6 and FLAG-tagged scaffold proteins also showed an interaction between C6 and adaptors. HEK293 cells were grown in 10-cm dishes and transfected with 5 g plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged NAP1, SINTBAD, TANK or GFP. proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunoblotting. a scaffold protein and luciferase-tagged TBK1 were co-expressed in the presence or absence of C6. the amount of luciferase co-immunoprecipitated with the FLAG-tagged allele was quantified [17], [53]. expression of isolated TBK1-binding domains (TBDs) inhibited the formation of the scaffold-kinase complexes. the expression of the late protein D8 was blocked by the presence of AraC. recombinant viruses that did or did not express the protein were generated. recombinant viruses that did or did not express the C6 protein were generated. a virus expressing HA-tagged C6 was constructed (vC6HA) for localisation and interaction studies a virus expressing HA-tagged C6 was constructed (vC6HA) reduced levels of C6 were detected from this recombinant virus using the anti-C6 serum. however this protein was detected using an antibody against the HA epitope. the anti-C6 serum was not suitable for the detection of wild-type C6 by immunofluorescence. however, both nuclear and cytoplasmic localisation of C6 was also observed by confocal microscopy. the isolation of the deletion mutant and vC6FS virus indicated that C6 is not essential for VACV replication. the viruses lacking C6 also caused significantly fewer signs of illness in infected mice between day 5 and day 12 after infection. female BALB/c mice (n = 10) were infected with 5103 p.f.u. of the indicated viruses. weight data (B) are expressed as the mean score SEM. the lesions induced by vC6 and vC6FS were significantly smaller than those induced by vC6WR and vC6Rev between 6 and 26 days post infection. the lesions induced by the viruses lacking C6 began to heal sooner (11 days post infection) than those induced by the viruses that did express C6. expression of C6 inhibited the activation of the IFN- promoter by transfected poly(dA-dT) or poly(IC) in HEK293 cells. also inhibited poly(IC)-induced IFN- promoter activation in mouse NIH3T3 cells. presence of C6 inhibited expression of endogenous IFN- mRNA in HEK293 cells. NIH3T3 cells were transfected with an IFN--promoter firefly luciferase reporter plasmid, a renilla luciferase transfection control and a C6 expression plasmid (C6). cells were stimulated by transfection with 800 ng poly(IC) per well, and stimulated by infection with Sendai virus 24 h after transfection. HEK293T cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing GFP-tagged C6 or a control plasmid expressing GFP for 16 h. the cells were then infected with Sendai virus for 6 h or stimulated with IL-1 for 15 min. the presence of GFP-tagged C6 did not affect the extent of p65 nuclear translocation. HEK293 cells were transfected with a firefly luciferase reporter plasmid. the luciferase activity was normalized to renilla luciferase activity. eight hours after transfection cells were treated with 25 g/ml poly(IC) for 16 h. HEK293T cells transfected with V5-tagged C6 or V5-tagged GFP were infected with Sendai virus for 6 h, fixed and stained for IRF3. the inhibition of promoter induction by C6 is due to the prevention of the activation and/or nuclear translocation of IRF3. HEK293 cells were seeded in 96-well plates, transfected with a pFR-firefly luciferase reporter plasmid under the control of the Gal4 promoter, a renilla luciferase transfection control, and an IRF3-Gal4 fusion plasmid. expression vector (50, 100 or 150 ng, wedges) and empty vector (EV) were co-transfected per well luciferase-based assay uses a fusion protein consisting of the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 and the transactivation domain of IRF3. when the IRF3 transactivation domain is phosphorylated by upstream signalling events, it induces expression of a luciferase reporter gene under the control of a Gal4-dependent promoter. the ectopic expression of signalling proteins that act upstream of IRF3 activation was used to the ability of C6 to inhibit the TBK1/IKK-dependent and -independent signalling pathways to IRF activation was compared by employing a luciferase-based IRF7 transactivation assay. the ability of C6 to inhibit the TBK1/IKK-dependent and -independent signalling pathways to IRF activation was compared by employing a luciferase-based IRF7 transactivation assay. HEK293 cells expressing TLR8 were stimulated with 2.5 g/ml CL075 or 1 M R848 for 16 h. HEK293 cells were transfected with pFR-firefly luciferase under control of an ISRE element, a renilla luciferase transfection control. the ISRE was driven by co-transfection of 2 ng of IRF7-4D. in all cases, cells were harvested 24 h after the first transfection. data are represented as mean SD from one representative of three experiments. HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged proteins. no interaction with TBK1 or IKK was detected. a reciprocal immunoprecipitation using lysates from cells over-expressing Streptavidin-tagged C6 and FLAG-tagged scaffold proteins also showed an interaction between C6 and adaptors. HEK293 cells were grown in 10-cm dishes and transfected with 5 g plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged NAP1, SINTBAD, TANK or GFP. proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunoblotting as indicated on the right. scaffold protein and luciferase-tagged TBK1 were co-expressed in presence or absence of C6. luciferase co-immunoprecipitated with the FLAG-tagged allele was quantified. expression of isolated TBK1-binding domains (TBDs) inhibited formation of scaffold-kinase complexes. recombinant VACVs were used to infect BSC-1 cells overnight with 5 p.f.u. per cell. cells were harvested and fractionated into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions. recombinant viruses that did or did not express the C6 protein were generated. a plaque purified wild type virus (vC6WR) was isolated from the same intermediate virus as the deletion mutant during transient dominant selection. this virus did not express C6 protein whereas vC6WR and vC6Rev both did. for localisation and interaction studies a virus expressing HA-tagged C6 was constructed (vC6HA) this protein was detected using the anti-C6 serum. the isolation of the deletion mutant and vC6FS virus indicated that C6 is not essential for VACV replication. the size of the plaques formed 72 h post infection with the various recombinant viruses was measured in three different cell lines. the absence of C6 had no effect on the mean plaque size in any of the cell types studied. the viruses lacking C6 also caused significantly fewer signs of illness in infected mice between day 5 and day 12 after infection. female mice (n = 10) were infected with 5103 p.f.u. of the indicated viruses and their weights (A) and signs of illness (B) were monitored daily. the lesions induced by vC6 and vC6FS were significantly smaller than those induced by vC6WR and vC6Rev between 6 and 26 days post infection. the lesions induced by the viruses lacking C6 began to heal sooner (11 days post infection) than those induced by the viruses that did express C6 (14 days post infection) thus, these data show that a virus lacking C6 is attenuated in vivo and indicate C6 is a A52 targets downstream signalling factors TRAF6 and IL-1 receptor associated kinase 2 (IRAK2). each of the viral proteins targets distinct components of these complexes. the kinase complexes to TRAF3 would then require the scaffold proteins. this would lead to the phosphorylation and activation of TBK1 and IKK. however, how exactly complex formation is linked to the activation of the kinases has yet to be elucidated. a complex containing TRAF3 prevents the association of TRAF3 with TBK1, IKK or TANK by inhibiting IRF3 activation. despite this, the effects of K7 and C6 are evidently not duplicative. however, deletion of any single member of this group causes virus attenuation suggesting non-redundant functions. VACV strains are in development as vaccine delivery systems against smallpox and other pathogens. deletion of a single ORF can attenuate the virus, thus making it safer for clinical use. it is shown that deletion of a single ORF can attenuate the virus.
