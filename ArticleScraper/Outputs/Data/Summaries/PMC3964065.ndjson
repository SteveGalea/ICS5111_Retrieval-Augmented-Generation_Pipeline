{"summary": "results and discussion To investigate and measure the strength of bifurcated H bonds, we use both experimental and computational approaches. we start by describing the experimental results based on isotope-edited FTIR spectroscopy and then show that DFT calculations yield very similar results that allow us to compute the energy of the bifurcated H bond. we then used statistical analysis of side-chain rotamer distribution to show the impact of the bifurcated H bond on protein structure. peptides were used: influenza M2 and SARS coronavirus E protein. all isotope-edited amide I modes were centered around 1,597 cm. the small variation in peak position is important to note as it gives an uncertainty range. peptide with valine at position 30 had a Phe26 amide I peak at 1,598 cm. a cysteine at residue 30 resulted in a Phe26 peak at 1,594 cm. hydroxyl residues at position 30 produced a shift of 5 cm and a hydroxyl yielded a shift of 14\u201315 cm. l of acetamide served as the H-bond acceptor, and the amide H+ of the acetamide derivatives was the H-bond donor. derivatives of acetamide mimicked amino acid side chains that were used to quantify the bifurcated H-bonding system. valine was mimicked by N-(2-Hydroxyethyl)acetamide. the isotopically ( C and O) labeled carbonyl group of N-Methylacetamide is depicted in red. we first sought to corroborate our FTIR results by theoretical DFT calculations of the shift in vibrational frequency upon bifurcated H-bond formation. N-Methylacetamide N-(2-Thioethyl)acetamide +gauche 8.2 8 D N-Methylacetamide N-(2-Thioethyl)acetamide +gauche 6.6 ND E N-Methylacetamide +gauche 5.6 ND The different systems and their potential H bonds are depicted in Fig. 3. we can now compute the energy of the bifurcated H bond using the same method. the energy obtained upon forming a bifurcated H-bonding system is mainly dependent on two components. this could be achieved by comparing systems in Fig. 3 B and D when the molecules were far apart from one another. the energy difference between the two systems is 1.2 kcal/mol. when we subtract from this value the energy that accounts for the dihedral angle component (2.2 kcal/mol), we obtain that the strength of the hydroxylic bifurcated H bond is 3.4 kcal/mol. thiolic H+ results in an even weaker bifurcated H bond of 2.6 kcal/mol. we analyzed the side-chain rotamer preference of serine. Threonine was not examined due to its biased side-chain preference. the preferred rotamer of serine in nonhelical structures is +gauche. the gauche rotamer is more prevalent in residues that face the lipid bilayer in comparison with those in the protein core. a side-chain rotamer is selected despite steric preferences when a bifurcated H bond is energetically favorable. the vibrational frequency of a C=O group that is bound to one H+ is expected to change when it is bound to two H+s. an individual amide group can be examined in the background of the entire protein\u2013lipid background using the 1-C=O label (32, 33) the extent of the isotope-edited shift can be used to gauge the strength of a particular additional H bond. in the M2 peptide, the isotope-edited amide I modes of 10 different amino acids were examined. the peptides were: Thr30, Val30, Cys30, and Ser30. each peptide exhibits a well-pronounced peak, which corresponds to the isotope-edited, 1-C=O Phe26 amide I mode (33). however, the precise location of the peak differs between the different peptides. we constructed a system resembling a small portion of an -helical turn with canonical and bifurcated H bonds. the simulations consisted of N-Methylacetamide, paired with four different acetamide derivatives. the amide carbonyl of N-Methylacetamide served as the H-bond acceptor. systems D and E are equivalent to B and C, respectively. the main-chain (canonical) and bifurcated H bonds are shown in orange and purple. the isotopically labeled carbonyl group of N-Methylacetamide is depicted in red. system H-bond acceptor H-bond donor Rotamer G (kcal/mol) (cm1) A N-Methylacetamide N-(2-Hydroxyethyl)acetamide gauche 5.7 0 B N-Methylacetamide N-(2-Thioethyl)acetamide gauche 10.0 15 C N-Methylacetamide N-(2-Thioethyl)acetamide +gauche 6.6 the strength of the canonical, amide H bond could be estimated by examining a system of N-Methylacetamide and N-Isobutylacetamide as a function of distance between the two molecules. in such a system, the energetic difference due to separation should be directly related to the energy of the single, canonical H bond. gauche and +gauche rotamers in N-(2-Hydroxyethyl)acetamide and N-(2-Thioethyl)acetamide are 2.2 and 0.47 kcal/mol, respectively. this was done by comparing the energies of systems in Fig. 3 B and D. the bifurcated H bond does not necessarily weaken the canonical H bond due to the fact that it does not compete with it. however, the formation of bifurcated H bonds depends greatly on their surroundings, stronger in apolar conditions and appreciably weaker in polar environments, such as water. n-(2-Hydroxyethyl)acetamide gauche 10.0 15 C N-Methylacetamide N-(2-Thioethyl)acetamide gauche 8.2 8 D N-Methylacetamide N-(2-Thioethyl)acetamide +gauche 6.6 ND E N-Methylacetamide +gauche 5.6 ND The different systems and their potential H bonds are depicted in Fig. in such a system, the energy difference due to separation should be directly related to the energy of the single, canonical H bond. separating the two molecules and thereby breaking the single H bond resulted in increasing the energy of the entire system by 5.7 kcal/mol. this value is in very good agreement with previous calculations from Honig and coworkers (9). hydroxylic bifurcated H bond differs only in the dihedral angle of N-(2-Thioethyl)acetamide (the H-bond donor) the energy difference between the two systems is 1.2 kcal/mol. a similar analysis comparing systems in Fig. 3 C and E yielded an energy for the thiolic bifurcated H bond of 2.6 kcal/mol. we analyzed the side-chain rotamer preference of serine. the preferred rotamer of serine in nonhelical structures is +gauche. the preferred rotamer of serine in nonhelical structures is +gauche. the gauche rotamer facilitates bifurcated H bonding between the hydroxylic side chain and the carbonyl of the residue. when the residue faces an aqueous environment, water may satisfy the H-bonding potential of both the hydroxylic side-chain and the main-chain carbonyl group. chamberlain and Bowie have also pointed to the same phenomenon when examining membrane proteins (38). 1 mg of lipid and 10 mg of lipid were dissolved in 2 mL of 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol. the solution was then warmed to 37\u00b0 for 30 min. liposomes were prepared by dissolving the sample in 2 mL of water. spectrometer used was a Nicolet Magna 560 spectrometer. 400 L of sample contained ca. 0.5 mg/mL protein and 5 mg/mL lipid. spectrometer was purged with CO2 and water-depleted air. then 1,000 interferograms were collected for each sample. the amide carbonyl acting as the H-bond acceptor was labeled with C =O to mimic the experimental frequency system. the amide carbonyl acting as the H-bond acceptor was labeled with C =O to mimic the experimental frequency system. a database of nonhomologous protein structures was retrieved from PDBselect (37) the database was then purged from any membrane protein using a list of solved membrane protein structures from Protein Data Bank of Transmembrane Proteins (48). the solvent accessible surface area was calculated using a Tcl script in vmd (44). the purification of the peptides was achieved using a 20-mL Jupiter 5 C4-300 high-performance liquid chromatography column (Phenomex); 2 mg of crude synthesis were dissolved in 2 mL of trifluoroacetic acid. elution was attained using a linear gradient to a final solvent composition of 60% isopropanol and 40% acetonitrile. spectrometer was purged with CO2 and water-depleted air. spectrometer was purged with water-depleted air. 1,000 interferograms were collected for each sample and averaged. acetonitrile and 12% (vol/vol) isopropanol were dissolved in 2 mL of 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (Merck) the solution was then warmed to 37\u00b0 for 30 min. liposomes were prepared by dissolving the sample in 2 mL of water. all calculations were carried out with the Q-chem software package to determine energy values for the bifurcated H bond (39). the self-consistent field (SCF) electronic energy and the vibrational frequency calculations were determined for all four systems indicated in Fig. 3 using aug-cc-pVDZ basis functions. nonbonded structures were created by rotating the dihedral angle of the bonded structures from gauche to +gauche. simulations were also conducted when the H-bond donor and acceptor were separated by 1,000 to discount any effect of H bonding between them. the hydroxyl or thiol group of N-(2-Hydroxyethyl)acetamide or N-(2-Thioethyl)acetamide were initially allowed freedom of movement to undergo geometric optimization to determine the bonded structures. the nonbonded structures were created by rotating the dihedral angle of the bonded structures from gauche to +gauche. the solvent accessible surface area was calculated using a Tcl script in vmd (44) the maximum accessibility ratio was calculated by dividing the solvent accessible surface area by the area of the residue detached from the protein."}
