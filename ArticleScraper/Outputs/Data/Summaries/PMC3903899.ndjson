{"summary": "the future of using lactobacilli as carriers of heterogenetic antigens is promising. two recombinant strains, Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 (LA4356-pH) and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp lactis D17 (DLD17-pH), both of which express hemagglutinin 1 of HPAI virus, were successfully constructed. the recombinant strain DLD17-pH is well adapted to the conditions in the intestines and can colonize the digestive tract. therefore, the recombinant strain would likely survive better in chicken intestines and should be able to stimulate a persistent intestinal mucosal immune response. mice immunized with recombinant Lactobacillus expressing HIV-1 Gag fused with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium flagellin (FliC) produced higher levels of sIgA, IgG, IL-4 and IFN- and had a greater ability to neutralize PEDV. this bacterium is a better candidate for a live bacterial vaccine against PEDV infection. professional antigen-presenting DCs located in or beneath the epithelium can sample and capture various bacterial antigens that cross the epithelial layer through M cells. this novel and highly innovative vaccine strategy has various benefits, including the specific activation of DCs. greatly increased immunity was achieved when the antigen expressed by the recombinant Lactobacillus was fused to a dendritic cell-targeting peptide. recombinant L. lactis expressing VP4 of rotavirus (cell surface associated) or VP7 (secreted) could elicit viral neutralizing antibodies. both local mucosal (intestinal IgA) and systemic immune responses against TGEV were induced. lactobacillus strains are widely used for the manufacturing of foodstuffs. they are classified as \"generally regarded as safe\" (GRAS) organisms. safe and highly efficient vaccines based on lactobacilli are an attractive alternative."}
