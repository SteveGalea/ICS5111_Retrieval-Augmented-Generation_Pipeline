{"summary": "Background Fever is an undifferentiated clinical feature that may enhance the sensitivity of syndromic surveillance systems. it may allow early detection of case clustering that indicates imminent threat of infectious disease outbreaks in the community. surveillance systems have emerged in recent years. most of these reported studies focused on emergency department visits. data were grouped into different syndromes (e.g. respiratory) in AHNH, each clinical department owned its designated wards. patients were assigned their destined wards by their presenting illnesses. designated isolation wards for contagious infections were available under the medical and paediatric departments. unpaired Student's t-test and Chi-square test were used for univariate analyses. we defined fever as an oral temperature above 37\u00b0C or equivalent. a case cluster as 3 or more spatially associated patient-episodes with fever during each 3-day period. the spatial growth of each cluster was monitored in GIS. patients with fever vs. patients with normal temperature (n = 1066) Fever (n = 448) Normal temperature (n = 618) Odds ratio (95% confidence interval) Age (mean SD) 51.7 31.7 60.8 25.7 - Age 12 years (number, %) 87 (19.4%) 54 (8.7%) 2.52 (1.75, 3.62) Age 13 years to 64 years (number, %) 166 (37.1%) 235 (38.0%) 0.96 (0.75 top 5 diagnoses made at the emergency department Patients with fever Patients with normal temperature Fever, not otherwise specified Chest pain, not otherwise specified Decreased general condition Decreased general condition Pneumonia/chest infection Dizziness, not otherwise specified Sepsis, not otherwise specified Chronic obstructive airway disease Dyspnea, not otherwise specified We identified 40 clusters (comprising 171 patient-episodes) during the study period. spatiotemporal analysis by means of the space-time scan statistics has been gaining popularity in recent years. we used fever as an indicator of infections in this study. fever is an undifferentiated clinical feature that occurs commonly in most infectious diseases. a buffer zone radius of 50 m and temporal unit of 3 consecutive days should meet the living conditions for most of the people living in the district under our study. the results were summarized in Table 3. Effect of variation on radius and temporal unit on the number of clusters detected. a substantial proportion of residents in RCHEs are physically dependent and hospitalized repeatedly because of the underlying medical conditions. in hong Kong, fever surveillance at sentinel RCHE (percentage of residents that are febrile) has been in place since 2007. in the spatiotemporal analysis of syndromic data from emergency department visits, 4 signals suggestive of possible clustering were detected over a period of one week. this is in contrast with our approach of fever surveillance, which relies on a non-specific indicator of infections. the essence of space-time scan statistics is detection of the excess number of cases under study in a pre-defined time frame and area. we have not categorized patients based on their provisional diagnoses at emergency department to refine the definition of case cluster. however, the provisional diagnoses were often non-specific. this phenomenon is in part explained by the skewing of our results towards elderly population. fectious Diseases, food and health bureau, the government of Hong Kong special administrative region."}
