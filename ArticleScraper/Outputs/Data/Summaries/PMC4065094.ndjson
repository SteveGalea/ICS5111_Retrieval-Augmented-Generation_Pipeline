{"summary": "the ectodomain of E protein alone could be recognized by all 12 mAbs tested. the characteristics of DENV E protein ectodomain in the absence of prM protein remains largely unknown. the four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV1, DENV2, DENV3, and DENV4) cause the most common and important arboviral diseases in humans in the tropical and subtropical areas [1]\u2013[3]. despite numerous efforts to develop therapeutic or prophylactic interventions, there is no licensed antiviral or DENV vaccine currently available [1]\u2013[3]. co-expression of prM and E proteins can produce recombinant virus-like particles (VLPs) at the C-terminus of E protein, there are two -helices (EH1 and EH2) in the stem region and two transmembrane domains (ET1 and ET2) in the anchor region [24]. anti-CD4 mAbs were used a negative control. Western blot analysis showed prM and E proteins form a heterodimer. prM protein has been shown to serve as a chaperon of E protein [28], [29]. expression, membrane association, glycosylation pattern, secretion and particle formation of E protein ectodomain of DENV4 in the absence of prM protein remains unknown. in the absence of prM protein, the ectodomain of E protein can secrete as well as form particles of approximately 49 nm in diameter. culture supernatants were collected at 48 h post-transfection. cells were washed with 1% NP40 lysis buffer, followed by centrifugation at 20,000g at 4\u00b0C for 30 min to obtain cell lystates. cells were clarified by centrifugation at 1,250g for 20 min. the solubilized fraction was subjected to 12% PAGE. the transfected cells were washed, resuspended in PBS, treated with 1% Triton X-100 on ice for 60 min. each of the 13 fractions was collected and subjected to Western blot analysis. mM MgCl2) was overlaid with 4 ml of 55% sucrose in LSB. then 1.5 ml of 10% sucrose in LSB, followed by ultracentrifugation at 247,606g. each fraction was subjected to Western blot analysis. each fraction was subjected to Western blot analysis. aliquot of VLPs was absorbed to a glow-discharged 300-mesh formvar/carbon film. each fraction was first diluted three folds in PBS, then ultracentrifuged at 65,000g and 4\u00b0C for 5 h. ELISA flat-bottom 96 well plate was coated with mouse mAb (1H10-6-7) against DENV4 E protein at 4\u00b0C overnight, followed by blocking with 1% BSA in PBS for 1 h and adding culture supernatants or recombinant DENV4 E protein. anti-E human mAbs and anti-human IgG conjugated with HRP each at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. culture supernatants were collected at 48 h post-transfection. cells were washed with PBS and treated with 1% NP40 lysis buffer. centrifugation at 20,000g at 4\u00b0C for 30 min to obtain cell lystates. membrane Flotation Assay 293T cells prepared in 10 cm dish were transfected with 10 g DNA by calcium phosphate method. cells were washed, resuspended in PBS, treated with 1% Triton X-100 on ice for 60 min, and then loaded into a 5 to 20% (wt/wt) sucrose gradient made with gradient buffer. l of 10% sucrose in LSB followed by ultracentrifugation at 247,606g (SW41 rotor, Beckman) at 4\u00b0C for 14 h. each fraction was subjected to Western blot analysis. aliquot of VLPs was absorbed to a glow-discharged 300-mesh formvar/carbon film. pellets overlaid with 5\u201320% sucrose gradient in PBS. each fraction was first diluted three folds in PBS, then ultracentrifuged at 65,000g and 4\u00b0C for 5 h. recombinant DENV4 E, prMEd395 and Ed395 added at 4\u00b0C overnight. anti-E human mAbs and anti-human IgG conjugated with HRP each at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. the absorbance at wavelength of 450 nm was read. the majority of E protein expressed by prME construct was found in low-density fractions. the peak of prM protein (fractions 4 and 5) expressed by prMEd395 did not co-sediment with that of prM protein ectodomain. in the absence of prM protein, E protein or E protein ectodomain alone can form large complexes. each of the 13 fractions was collected and subjected to Western blot analysis. lysates of 293T cells transfected with prMEd395 or Ed395 were digested with endo H or PNGase F. each of the 13 fractions was subjected to western blot analysis. a, E protein expressed by prME and E constructs was found predominately in the membrane fractions (fractions 2 and 3), as indicated by an ER membrane protein, calnexin. in the absence of transmembrane domains, E protein ectodomain associates with membrane. at 48 h, 293T cells were homogenized and centrifuged to clear nuclei and debris. deglycosylated E (dgE) or deglycosylated Ed395 (dgEd395) subjected to Western blot analysis using a dengue-immune human serum. 293T cells transfected with each of the four constructs were subjected to subcellular fractionation to separate the membrane-bound and soluble fractions. findings suggest that E protein ectodomain associates with membrane in or beyond trans-Golgi probably due to the lack of the stem/transmembrane domains. pellets derived from culture supernatants, which contain VLPs, were examined by Western blot analysis using a dengue-immune serum. supernatants post-ultracentrifugation were quantified by a capture-ELISA. pellets derived from culture supernatants of each transfectant were treated with or without 1% Triton X-100. each fraction was subjected to Western blot analysis using a dengue-immune serum (top), rabbit anti-M serum (middle) and anti-actin mAb. in the absence of Trion X-100 pellets derived from 293T cells transfected with prME, prMEd395 or Ed395 sedimented as a discrete population (fractions 4 to 6) with a density of 1.13\u20131.15 g/cm3 (Figure S2). cytoskeleton-driven mechanism has been shown to be involved in the budding of several RNA viruses [49]\u2013[51]. both top fractions (1 to 4) and bottom fractions (8 to 10) the gradient-purified VLPs were further examined by EM. the VLPs derived from prME had two sizes, small ones with a mean diameter of 32.3 nm (20.7 to 55.8 nm, fraction 4) and large ones with a mean diameter of 47.6 nm (32 to 65.2 nm, fraction 10). mutations introduced to the N-linked glycosylation sites at residues 67 or 153 of E protein affected release and infectivity of DENV virions. site-direct mutagenesis was carried out to replace each of the two threonines (residues 69 and 155) at the third position of N-glycosylation sites with an alanine or valine in the Ed395 construct. alanine or valine substitution introduced to either threonine residue at the third position of two N-glycosylation sites reduce the secretion of E protein ectodomain. alanine or valine substitution introduced to either threonine residue at the third position of two N-glycosylation sites reduce the secretion of E protein ectodomain. the amount of E protein expressed by prMEd395, E or Ed395 construct was generally comparable to that of prMEd395, suggesting that in the absence of prM protein, E protein and E protein ectodomain preserve the epitopes recognized by these two mAbs and human serum. the majority of E protein expressed by prME construct was found in the low-density fractions (fractions 6 to 8). in the absence of prM protein, E protein or E protein ectodomain alone can form large complexes, most likely E-E dimer or higher order complexes in high density fractions. at 48 h, 293T cells transfected with prME, prMEd395, E or Ed395 were treated with Triton X-100; cell lysates and protein markers were subjected to 5 to 20% sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. cated E protein in fraction 14 (of prMEd395 and Ed395) suggests that the truncated E protein in fraction 14 has passed the quality control machinery in ER, transported beyond trans-Golgi. the flaviviral E protein has been shown to associate with membranes in cells [38], [45]. 293T cells transfected with prME, prMEd395, E or Ed395 were resuspended in modified buffer B and disrupted by freeze-thaw. membrane fraction and pellets derived from soluble fraction were subjected to Western blot analysis using a dengue-immune human serum. calnexin, an integral ER membrane protein, was detected in the membrane fraction but not in the soluble fraction. in both membrane and soluble fractions, E protein expressed by prME and E constructs was sensitive to endo H. in contrast, E protein ectodomain expressed by prMEd395 and Ed395 constructs was resistant to endo H. cell lysates and pellets derived from culture supernatants of 293T cells transfected with prME, prMEd395, E or Ed395 were subjected to Western blot analysis using a dengue-immune serum. the amounts of various forms of E protein in culture supernatants, including total E protein in supernatants (Total sup), E protein in pellets containing VLPs (pellet-VLPs) and soluble E the majority (more than 90%) of E protein expressed by prME construct was present in the pellets containing VLPs. in contrast, the majority of E protein expressed by prMEd395 and Ed395 was present in soluble E protein and less than 1% was in the pellets, probably forming VLPs. the possibility that they were derived from cell debris after transfection cannot be ruled out. -actin but not -tubulin was incorporated into the VLPs of prME or prMEd395. the majority of E protein in pellets derived from prME was detected in both top fractions (1 to 4) and bottom fractions (8 to 10), suggesting two major populations of VLPs with different sizes. each fraction of the 10 fractions was subjected to immunogold labeling using anti-E mAb (1H10-6-7), stained with 2% PTA and photographed at same magnification. the size of particles (diameter) of fractions 4 and 10 derived from prME and fraction 10 derived from Ed395 were determined by measuring more than 130 particles from electron micrographs. the amount of mutant E protein ectodomain expressed by the 4 mutants in cell lysates was comparable to that of WT Ed395 construct. alanine or valine substitution introduced to either threonine residue at the third position of two N-glycosylation sites reduce the secretion of E protein ectodomain. the amounts of Ed395 in cells and supernatants were quantified by capture-ELISA. we investigated the DENV4 E protein ectodomain expressed in the presence or absence of prM protein. in the absence of prM protein, E protein ectodomain expresses well. ctodomain expressed by prMEd395 interacts with several hydrophobic residues in the helix B of domain II facing the viral membrane. previous studies of flaviviral VLPs including TBEV and WNV have reported the heterogeneity of VLPs in size with predominantly two populations, large and small VLPs. NV VLPs affect the recognition by different anti-E mAbs. transmembrane domains and prM-E interaction are critical for the production of TBEV and YFV VLPs. the molecular mechanism remains to be further investigated. analysis of DENV E protein ectodomain dimer revealed that the N-linked glycan at residue 153 covers the fusion loop of domain II. mutants DENV2, DENV3 and WNV with loss of N-linked glycan at residue 153 were found to fuse with target membrane at elevated pH or have lower stability at mildly acidic pH [6], [60], [61]. prM protein or from Drosophila Schneicher 2 (S2) cells (recombinant E) [63] can be recognized similarly well by all 9 human mAbs tested. this suggests that lacking prM protein does not affect the overall conformation of E protein ectodomain and that secreted E protein ectodomains derived form mammalian cells and insect cells preserve the epitopes recognized by all human mAbs. recombinant DENV4 E protein (serial dilutions) were added to 96-well plate pre-coated with a human dengue-immune serum, followed by adding mouse anti-E mAb (1H10-6-7) and secondary antibody to generate a standard curve. data are means with standard deviation of duplicates from one representative experiment of two. Pellets derived from 293T cells transfected with prME or Ed395 were subjected to a 5 to 20% (wt/wt) sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation as in Figure 5. Gradient-purified particles from fractions 10 were stained with 2% PTA and photographed at low magnification (A) or subjected to immunogold labeling using anti-E mAb."}
