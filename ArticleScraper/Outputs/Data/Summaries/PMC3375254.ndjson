{"summary": "at least four effector subsets are derived by differentiation from nave CD4 T cells. each expresses a characteristic combination of transcription factors, soluble mediators and surface molecules [1], [2]. Th1 cells predominantly produce interferon- (IFN) and protect against intracellular pathogens. acute modifications of cytokine patterns can also occur. IL-12+ IL-18 enhance the secretion of IFN by Th1 cells. IL-10, TGF, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and adenosine inhibit inflammatory cytokine production. naive and memory, Th1 and Th2, all express AR in response to TCR stimulation. factors that elevate cAMP levels synergized with TCR stimulation to enhance AR expression, while inhibiting expression of most inflammatory cytokines. 45RA (HI100), FITC conjugated anti-human CD45RO (UCHL1), PE-Cy5 conjugated anti-human CD19 (HIB19), PE-Cy7 conjugated anti-human IFN (4S.B3), and APC-conjugated streptavidin were obtained from eBioscience (San Diego, CA). cAMP agonist (8-CPT-cAMP) and cAMP antagonist (Rp-8-Br-cAMP) were PBMC were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque (Cellgro, Herndon, VA) density gradient centrifugation. cells were suspended in complete RPMI-8 medium containing 100U penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) recombinant human IL-2 (5 ng/mL), recombinant human IL-4 (20 ng/mL, R&D Systems), anti-IL-12 (5 g/ml, ebioscience) and anti-IFN (5 g/ml, R&D Systems). fresh medium containing 5 ng/mL IL-2 was added if necessary to cultures showing strong proliferation. cells were stained with anti-AR, anti-IFN, anti-IL-2, anti-IL-4, anti-IL-17A, anti-TNF, anti-CD3 and anti-CD154. after stimulation, cells were stained with antibodies against AR, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD123, CD69 and 7-AAD. specific for AR, HB-EGF, IL-2, IFN, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13, CD3d, EGF, Neuregulin (NRG) 1\u20134, epiregulin (EREG), betacellulin (BTC) and TGF were all obtained from TaqMan Gene Expression Assays. perCP-Cy5.5 conjugated anti-human CD27 (O323), Alexa Fluor 700 conjugated anti-human CD62L (DREG-56), Pacific Blue conjugated anti-human CXCR3 (TG1/CXCR3), PE-Cy7 or PE-Cy5 conjugated anti-human CD123 (6H6), FITC conjugated anti-human IL-4 (MP4-25D2), and PerCP-Cy5.5 conjugated anti-human IL-17A ( cAMP agonist (8-CPT-cAMP) and cAMP antagonist (Rp-8-Br-cAMP) were obtained from BioLog (Bremen, Germany). PBMC were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque (Cellgro, Herndon, VA) density gradient centrifugation. in vitro Induction of allogeneic Th1 and Th2 cell Lines Purified human nave CD4 T cells were stimulated with irradiated (100Gy) allogeneic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) \u2013 transformed B cells (11 ratio) in complete RPMI-8 medium at 105 cells/mL in round-bottom 96-well plate. Th2-biased cultures contained recombinant human IL-2 (5 ng/mL), recomb PBMC (106 per well) were stimulated with medium alone, anti-CD3 (5 g/ml) + anti-CD28 (1 g/ml), Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB, 1 g/ml), PMA (10 ng/mL) + ionomycin (500 ng/mL), influenza H1N1 peptides (H1N1 [New Caledonia/New York], 20 ng/mL quantitative real-time PCR for Gene Expression Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen) cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription from total RNA using multiScribeTM Reverse Transcriptase. cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription from total RNA using random hexamer primers (Applied Biosystems) human PBMCs were stimulated with soluble anti-CD3+ anti-CD28, SEB, or PMA + ionomycin for 10 hours. CD69 staining increased on almost all anti-CD3/CD28- and P+I-stimulated cells, and a subset of SEB-stimulated cells. the upper panels show the gating strategy to identify activated (CD69+) CD4 or CD8 T cells expressing AR. the lower panels show the induction of AR by different stimuli in CD4 or CD8 T cells. the kinetics of HB-EGF mRNA expression were measured on purified CD4 T cells responding to anti-CD3/CD28 beads. at 4 hours, the mRNA levels of EGF family members were measured by RT-PCR. most or all T Cell Subsets can Express AR In mice, AR was expressed selectively in TCR-activated Th2 cells [27] but not Th1 cells. however, most human CD4 (and CD8) T cells expressed AR in response to PMA plus ionomycin stimulation (Figure 1A) AR, IL-2, IFN or IL-4 expression was measured in four subjects in CD45RA+ (open) and CD45RA- (solid) CD4+ and CD8+ T cells after allogeneic EBV-transformed B cell stimulation. background values have been subtracted. PBMC were treated with medium alone or SEB in presence of TAPI-1 for 8 hours. naive human CD4 T cell populations were induced by stimulation of sorted naive human CD4 T cells with an allogeneic B cell line. the populations were further enriched by using the Cytokine Secretion Assay to sort IFN- or IL-5-producing cells. PBMC were treated with influenza H1N1 peptides or tetanus (five subjects each) or the allergens Fel d1 (solid symbols) or Der p1 (open symbols) (three subjects each) the numbers of memory CD4 T cells expressing AR and other cytokines were measured by ICS. each symbol represents one individual and the filled bar is the mean of all tested subjects. with TNF, IL-2, IFN, IL-4 and IL-17 at slightly higher frequencies than predicted by random association. the subset-specific cytokines IFN, IL-4 and IL-17 showed mostly negative associations between each other, as expected. the results were confirmed at the RNA level by sorting SEB-stimulated human PBMC according to surface AR expression. mRNA levels were strongly elevated in the IFN+ influenza-specific cells compared to either CD69+ CD4+ cells from unstimulated cultures. the specificity of the sorting was demonstrated by the strong enrichment of IFN mRNA in the CD69+ IFN+ population. our results showed that AR production was not limited to a pre-committed subset of T cells. we then tested whether AR production was regulated by acute signals in the immediate milieu during TCR stimulation. however, the negatively-selected T cell population would also have contained basophils. the concentrations of AR in the supernatant and cell lysates were measured by ELISA. RNA was extracted at 4 hours, and AR mRNA was measured by RT-PCR. naive and memory CD4 T cells produce AR. cAMP signaling was altered by an agonist (8-CPT-cAMP) that directly targeted PKA to mimic the increase of intracellular cAMP levels. we tested natural and pharmacological agents that increase the intracellular levels of cAMP by acting at two additional steps. cAMP-PKA-CREB signaling pathway regulates AR expression. human PBMCs were stimulated with soluble anti-CD3+ anti-CD28, SEB, or PMA + ionomycin for 10 hours. CD69 staining increased on almost all anti-CD3/CD28- and P+I-stimulated cells. this increase was most obvious in the P+I-stimulated cells. PCR in purified CD4 and CD8 T cells after activation by anti-CD28 beads. results in (A) and (B) are representative of at least three experiments. to independently confirm AR expression by human T cells. the kinetics of HB-EGF mRNA expression were measured on purified CD4 T cells responding to anti-CD3/CD28 beads. all results are representative of three independent experiments. surface AR was stained during TCR activation in the presence of the ADAM17/TACE inhibitor TAPI-1. most or all T Cell Subsets can Express AR In mice, AR was expressed selectively in TCR-activated Th2 cells [27] but not Th1 cells expressed AR even when in vitro-derived mouse Th1 and Th2 cell lines were activated together in same culture. however, most human CD4 (and CD8) T cells expressed AR in response to PMA plus ionomycin stimulation (Figure 1A) PBMC were treated with medium alone or SEB in the presence of TAPI-1. six populations were sorted based on surface AR, CD69 and CD45RA expression. results in (A) and (B) represent at least three experiments, (C) represents two experiments. sorted naive human CD4 T cell populations were induced by stimulation of sorted naive human CD4 T cells with an allogeneic B cell line. the populations were further enriched by using the Cytokine Secretion Assay to sort IFN- or IL-5-producing cells. both Th1 and Th2 human cell lines expressed AR. the backgrounds (no antigen) have been subtracted. each symbol represents one individual and the filled bar is the mean of all tested subjects. the backgrounds (no antigen) have been subtracted. both AR+ and AR- memory CD4 T cells expressed similar levels of IL-4 and IFN as measured by RT-PCR. IL-2 mRNA levels were higher in AR+ T cells, in both CD45RA- and CD45RA+ cells. chemokine receptors expressed selectively by T cell subsets lead to different homing and chemotactic properties. expression patterns of chemokine receptors are partly but not entirely related to cytokine commitment patterns [36]\u2013[39]. both nave and memory human CD4 T cells expressed AR during TCR activation. PBMC were treated with medium alone or allogeneic EBV-transformed B cells for 10 hours and analyzed by ICS. 45RA+ subsets of CD4 T cells were tested at the mRNA level in SEB-stimulated cells sorted according to AR and CD45RA expression. naive CD4 T cells are relatively homogeneous, but the memory population includes wide range of differentiated effector subsets. the figure shows the ratio between the observed frequencies of double-producing T cells for each cytokine pair, and the expected frequencies. values represent the ratios for the double-producer combination defined by the row and column labels. IL-4, IFN and IL-2 mRNA levels were measured by RT-PCR in the sorted populations described in Figure 4C. the frequencies of cells expressing AR plus each of the other cytokines were measured from the ICS results. these values were then compared with the double-producing frequencies predicted for random association of each cytokine pair. the results were confirmed at the RNA level by sorting SEB-stimulated human PBMC according to surface AR expression. RT-PCR showed that AR mRNA levels were strongly elevated in the IFN+ influenza-specific cells compared to either CD69+ CD4+ cells from unstimulated cultures. the specificity of the sorting was demonstrated by the strong enrichment of IFN mRNA in the CD69+ IFN+ population. PBMC were treated with medium alone, anti-CD3+ anti-CD28 antibodies, or SEB in the presence of TAPI-1 for 8 hours. we then tested whether AR production was regulated by acute signals in the immediate milieu during TCR stimulation. RNA was extracted at 4 hours, and AR mRNA was measured by RT-PCR. mRNA levels of AR and other cytokines were measured by RT-PCR. naive and memory CD4 T cells produce AR. cAMP agonist strongly enhanced AR expression in both populations. cAMP signaling was altered by an agonist (8-CPT-cAMP) that targeted PKA to mimic the increase of intracellular cAMP levels. cAMP-PKA-CREB signaling pathway regulates AR expression. these results are consistent with previous studies with cAMP agonists and natural cAMP elevating agents. thus AR expression in T cells is enhanced under conditions that suppress the production of many other cytokines. TCR and cAMP signals synergize to induce AR expression. RNA was extracted at 4 hours, and AR mRNA was measured by RT-PCR. the concentration of AR in the 24-hour supernatant was measured by ELISA. naive and memory CD4 T cells produce AR. all four cAMP elevating agents upregulated AR mRNA and protein expression in anti-CD3-stimulated T cells. the enhancement of AR by the cAMP antagonist suggested that PDE reduced the moderate levels of cAMP induced by TCR activation in CD4 T cells. this suggests that PDE reduced the moderate levels of cAMP induced by TCR activation in CD4 T cells. discrepancy between mouse and human T cell regulation highlights importance of performing cross-species comparisons of effector T cell phenotypes. expression of AR also showed moderate correlation with expression of TNF. natural mediators that elevate the cAMP pathway and lead to PKA activation include PGE2 and adenosine. both mediators are produced at sites of immune inflammation, adenosine by degradation of ATP from dying cells, and PGE2 by activated macrophages. both mediators are produced at sites of immune inflammation, adenosine by degradation of ATP from dying cells, and PGE2 by activated macrophages. anti-inflammatory cytokines and induction of tissue-remodeling cytokines may represent a switch from pathogen clearance to tissue repair mechanisms by effector human T cells. in vitro induced allogeneic Th1 and Th2 cell lines from B6PL or AR/ mice were stimulated with plate-coated anti-CD3 (2 g/mL) + anti-CD28 (1 g/mL) antibodies for 6 hours. IFN (XMG1.2) was obtained from Invitrogen."}
