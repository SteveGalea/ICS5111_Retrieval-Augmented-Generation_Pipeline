{"summary": "the nucleolus is primarily known as the site within the nucleus of ribosome-subunit biogenesis. it is involved in many diverse cellular functions, including regulation of mitosis, cell cycle control and proliferation. many viruses target the host cell nucleolus and usurp its function in order to aid viral replication. viral capsid/nucleoproteins from coronaviruses (14), arteriviruses (15), alphaviruses (16), and flaviviruses (17, 18) hepatitis C virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NS5B) binds to abundant nucleolar protein nucleolin, mislocalizing it to the cytoplasm, leading to enhanced viral replication. NS5 from both deNV-1 and -2 is able to localize within the nucleolus of NS5-transfected and virus-infected cells. NS5 nucleolar accumulation is dynamically regulated by extracellular pH, and identify the key residues responsible for this novel targeting ability. a virus that cannot be recovered without compensating mutations. pEGFP-NS5 (DENV-1 and DENV-2) (22) and pEPI-GFP-NS5-1-900 (DENV-2, TSV01) were produced by subcloning NS5 from pEGFP-NS5 using restriction sites XhoI and HpaI (New England BioLabs) pEPI-GFP-NS5-1-244 was generated for this study as previously using gateway cloning technology (27) HEK-293T cells transfected with GFP, GFP-NS5 wild type (WT) or pHNTRm were lysed 36 h posttransfection. immunocomplexes were precipitated and eluted using GFP-Trap resin. live imaging of vero cells transfected with GFP-NS5 constructs was performed in phenol-free (PF) DMEM containing 10% FCS modified to the indicated pH using HCl and NaOH. cells were stressed by adding 100 M CoCl2 for 6 h (hypoxia) or incubated in hyperosmotic (0.5 M sorbitol in PF-DMEM) or hypo-osmotic medium for 15 min prior to live imaging. the fluorescence intensity in the nucleolus (Fnu), nucleus (Fn) and cytoplasm (Fc) was determined with the background fluorescence (untransfected cells) subtracted to enable the nucleolar/nuclear (Fnu/n) or the nuclear/cytoplasmic (Fn/c) ratio to be determined. for indirect immunofluorescence experiments, cells were incubated with pH-adjusted DMEM at 24 h postinfection (p.i.) for 5 min prior to fixation and staining. mutant and WT virus titers were normalized to infect Vero cells at an MOI of 0.03. pEGFP-NS5 (DENV-1 and DENV-2) (22) and pEPI-GFP-NS5-1-900 (DENV-2, TSV01) were produced by subcloning NS5 from pEGFP-NS5 using restriction sites XhoI and HpaI (New England BioLabs) pEPI-GFP-NS5-1-244 was generated for this study as previously using Gateway cloning technology (27) pEPI-GFP-NS5-1-900 cloned through unique restriction sites within NS5, MluI, and StuI (New England BioLabs) immunocomplexes were precipitated and eluted using GFP-Trap resin (ChromoTek) live imaging of vero cells transfected with GFP-NS5 constructs was performed in phenol-free (PF) DMEM containing 10% FCS modified to the indicated pH using HCl and NaOH. cells were stressed by adding 100 M CoCl2 for 6 h (hypoxia) or incubated in hyperosmotic (0.5 M sorbitol in PF-DMEM) for 15 min prior to live imaging. in the nucleolus (Fnu), nucleus (Fn) and cytoplasm (Fc) was determined with the background fluorescence (untransfected cells) subtracted to enable the nucleolar/nuclear (Fnu/n) or the nuclear/cytoplasmic (Fn/c) ratio to be determined. the data were exported to Microsoft Excel, and the graphs were then plotted using Prism 6. mutant and WT virus titers were normalized to infect vero cells at 0.03. NS5 localizes to the nucleus in infected and transfected cells. RESULTS NS5 accumulates within the nucleolus of deNV-infected cells. plot profile of fluorescence across nucleus, including nucleolus, was analyzed. mCherry-NS5 localizes within nucleolus during DENV infection. mCherry-NS5 localizes within nucleolus even as it intersectes with mCherry. DIC images are shown to the right to identify the nucleoli. the results represent the means + the standards error of the mean. NS5 nucleolar accumulation is modulated by extracellular pH. the ability of NS5 to accumulate in intact nucleoli can be influenced by extracellular pH. NS5 localizes in the nucleus of deNV-2-infected cells varies between serotypes. NS5 from DENV-2 shows almost exclusively nuclear localization. analysis of the Fnu/n showed that NS5 was largely excluded from the nucleolus in DENV-1 infected cells at neutral pH conditions (22). NS5 was localized throughout the nucleus and cytoplasm under acidic conditions such that DENV-1 NS5 was diffusely localized throughout the nucleus. CLSM images of live GFP, GFP-NS5 (DENV-1 or -2 as indicated) expressed in vero cells were imaged 10 min after the cell culture medium was changed to the indicated pH. the results represent the means + the SEM, where n 25. nucleolar accumulation of NS5 occurs rapidly and reversibly in response to extracellular pH. a range of extracellular pHs were tested to characterize nucleolar accumulation of NS5 in more detail. at pH 11, the concentration of GFP-NS5 was lower in the nucleolus than the nucleus. the dynamics of nucleolar accumulation were investigated by initially exposing GFP-NS5 (DENV-2)-expressing cells to basic pH (8.5), before switching to pH 6, or vice versa, with live monitoring of single cells over time by CLSM. nucleolar accumulation was induced very rapidly upon transition of cells from pH 8.5 to pH 6, with increased fluorescence in the nucleoli becoming evident 1 min after the pH change. lus is largely independent of the absolute levels of NS5 in either the nucleus or the cytoplasm. NS5 traffics dynamically between the nucleolus and nucleoplasm. the tumor suppressor, von Hippel-Lindau protein (VHL), has previously been reported to be retained in the nucleolus in an H+-dependent manner. NS5 traffics dynamically between the nucleus and nucleolus. FRAP analysis was performed on GFP-NS5 and -fibrillarin-expressing Vero cells. images of representative cells prebleach and postbleach are shown with red squares indicating the bleach area. NS5 residues 1 to 244 contain the pH-sensitive nucleolar-targeting region (pHNTR) Schematic diagram of NS5 highlights a stretch of hydrophobic amino acids predicted to contribute to nucleolar targeting of NS5. dependent nucleolar detention signal (NoDSH+) within VHL protein. phi symbolizes any hydrophobic residue; R, critical arginines; r, less critical arginine; and X, any amino acid) subnuclear targeting domains confer nucleolar targeting of VHL upon exposure to low pH (42). a sequence within NS5 1-244 possessing limited similarity to the hydrophobic region of the noDSH+. itation experiments showed that both NS5 and NS5 pHNTRm were able to associate with comparable levels of STAT2. this suggests that the key residues of the pHNTR and that NS5 nucleolar localization in general are not critical for this activity. the predicted pHNTR was required for efficient DENV replication. infection of vero cells with a normalized concentration of WT or pHNTR mutant virus (I165/A167/A168; MOI of 0.03) revealed a 71% reduction in viral RNA copies present in the culture supernatant at 72 h p.i. for the mutant virus. this clearly demonstrating that pHNTR mutation is detrimental to viral growth and that the pHNTR provides an essential role for efficient virus replication. NS5 localizes to the nucleus in infected cells. mCherry alone cotransfected with GFP-nucleolin. mCherry alone cotransfected with GFP-nucleolin. mCherry-NS5 localizes within the nucleolus during DENV infection. mCherry-NS5 is present in nucleolar regions colocalized with nucleolin. mCherry-NS5 is present in nucleolar regions colocalized with nucleolin. mCherry-NS5 is present in nucleolar regions colocalized with nucleolin. NS5 nucleolar accumulation is modulated by extracellular pH. the ability of NS5 to localize within the nucleolus can be influenced by extracellular pH. NS5 localizes in intact nucleoli at a ratio of 1.2 (Fnu/n) NS5 from DENV-2 and -3 shows almost exclusively nuclear localization. NS5 from DENV-1 and -4 shows more diffuse localization throughout the nucleus and cytoplasm. at pH 8.5, the Fnu/n for DENV-1 was similar to that at pH 7.4, suggesting NS5 exclusion from the nucleolus is maximal at neutral pH. similar effects were observed in vero cells transfected with GFP-NS5 from DENV-1 and -2 and imaged live using CLSM. CLSM images of live GFP, GFP-NS5 (DENV-1 or -2 as indicated) expressed in vero cells were imaged 10 min after the cell culture medium was changed to the indicated pH. results represent means + the SEM, where n 25. at pH 11, the concentration of GFP-NS5 was lower in the nucleolus than the nucleus (Fnu/n of 0.86) nucleolar accumulation was also modulated consistently with changes in pH over the physiologically relevant pH range of 6.4 to 7.8. nucleolar accumulation was reversible, whereby cells transferred from pH 8.5 to 6 and then back to 8.5 showed a rapid reduction in nucleolar accumulation. however, the pH could be changed several times with responses repeated to similar extent. NS5 both displayed the same levels of nucleolar accumulation and pH-sensitivity as WT NS5 (data not shown) analysis of NS5 using FRAP determined NS5 nucleolar trafficking to be highly dynamic. NS5 levels rapidly increased in the nucleolus and decreased in the nucleus, while remaining constant in the cytoplasm. similar results were obtained for nucleolar markers nucleolin and fibrillarin. the percentage recovery postbleaching was determined by measuring Fnu/n values over time compared with initial (prebleach) Fnu/n values. the results represent the means + the SEM (n = 5). identification of the pH-sensitive nucleolar-targeting region (pHNTR) in NS5. NS5 containing Ala substitutions at Leu-165, Leu-167, and Val-168 fused to GFP. nucleoli are indicated by white and black arrows in DIC images. results represent means + the SEM, where n > 25. the noDSH+ within residues 162 to 172 is highly conserved between all 4 DENV serotypes. we targeted this region in DENV-2 GFP-NS5 for mutagenesis, substituting Leu-165, Leu-167, and Val-168 with Ala. these mutations in the predicted pHNTR resulted in significantly reduced nucleolar accumulation of NS5. mutant virus carrying the pHNTR mutations revealed a 71% reduction in viral RNA copies present in the culture supernatant at 72 h p.i. for the mutant virus. mutation of leu167 to Ala was evident in all three cultures, whereas Val168 substitution by Ala was detected in cultures 1 and 2 but reverted to Val168 in culture 3. additional experiments were attempted using vero cells directly transfected with high levels of viral RNA (29), but this failed to result in cells expressing pHNTRm NS5. this further underlines the critical importance of the pHNTR to DENV infection. however, it remains not possible to discard the potential role of the pHNTR in additional functions of NS5 in the context of viral infection. the nucleolus is a key player in the cellular stress response, including to extracellular pH (50) it is conceivable that NS5's ability to traffic reversibly and rapidly between the nucleus and nucleolus may be important in rapidly countering or modulating cellular responses to viral infection."}
