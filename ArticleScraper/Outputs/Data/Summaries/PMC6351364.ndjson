{"summary": "the total number of hospital visits was 3.44 billion (42.1% of the total number of visits) in 2017 (1). it is more difficult for medical staff to implement infection prevention and control measures in OED, compared to inpatient care settings. system building of HAIs management is critical and long-effective mechanism in infection control and prevention of HAIs in OED. outpatient and emergency medical staff should master and follow the relevant systems and procedures for HAIs management. HAIs management team (HMT) and system should be built in OED of healthcare facilities. outpatient and emergency medical staff should master and follow the relevant systems and procedures for HAIs management, especially the implementation of standard prevention measures. training should include both HCP safety and patient safety. training needs to consider diversified objects (administrators, clinical medical staff, logistics, etc.) and multi-level (Hospital and departmental scope) regular practice surveys or audits offer a means to ensure ongoing compliance of HCP with recommended practice. standard precautions are the minimum infection prevention practices that apply to all patient care which must be strictly adhered (8) in clinical practice. these practices are designed to both protect HCP and patients from spreading infections among patients. PPE is applied to protect HCP from exposure to or contact with suspected or confirmed infectious agents. the selection of PPE is based on potential exposure to blood, body fluids or infectious agents. each outpatient or emergency facility should evaluate potential exposure of each service they provide. the majority resulted from unsafe injection practices and lapses could be accounted for low adherence to standard precaution. injection safety includes practices intended to prevent transmission of infectious diseases between one patient and another. implementation of basic infection prevention measures decreased subsequent transmission. medical staff must clearly understand their mission and responsibilities for reusable devices. medical items should be clearly labeled as either reusable or single-use. disposable medical supplies should be disposed of in accordance with medical waste in a timely manner. hands are the most common vehicle in the transmission of contact-borne pathogen. insufficient hand hygiene would lead to healthcare-associated infections (10,12) hand hygiene is also critical to interrupt transmission risk of spreading infections in outpatient or emergency settings. the strategy proposed has been termed Respiratory Hygiene/Cough Etiquette (14,15) and is intended to be incorporated into infection control practices as a new component of Standard Precautions. the strategy applies to any person with signs of illness including cough, congestion, rhinorrhea, or increased production of respiratory secretions when entering a healthcare facility. reusable medical devices must be cleaned and maintained according to manufacturer's regulations. medical staff must clearly understand their mission and responsibilities for reusable devices. medical items should be clearly labeled as either reusable or single-use. high-risk areas include emergency offices, emergency pharmacies, and interiors. high-risk areas include blood collection room, dressing room, puncture room, injection room, otolaryngology clinic, infectious disease clinic, intestinal clinic, fever clinic, emergency operation room, dental clinic, endoscope department and other areas. Detailed information related to transmission-based precautions can be found in the 2009 guideline for Isolation Precautions (8). the recommendations described the basic or the minimal infection prevention measures for safe care in the OED."}
