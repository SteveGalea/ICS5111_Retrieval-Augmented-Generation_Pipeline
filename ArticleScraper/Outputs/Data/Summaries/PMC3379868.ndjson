{"summary": "Purpose Respiratory infection is the most common cause for acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AE-COPD) the aim of this work was to study the etiology of the respiratory infection in order to assess the usefulness of the clinical and analytical parameters used for COPD identification. the causes of acute exacerbations of COPD (AE-COPD) are multifactorial. half of the cases are attributed to respiratory infections (50%), but exacerbations are also associated with pollution, temperature changes, allergens, and other comorbidities. COPD was defined according to the global initiative for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (GOLD) criteria. a diagnosis of acute exacerbation was assumed when a minimum of two Anthonisen criteria18 were present. any patient with COPD decompensation that was caused by a noninfectious disease was excluded from the study. pneumonia and hospital admissions during the previous year were evaluated. the contact with family members at home suffering from an upper respiratory tract infection was collected. a chest radiograph was taken to rule out pneumonia. sputum Gram stain (10 epithelial cells and >25 polymorphonuclear leukocytes) were collected from patients at admission and 4 weeks after the initial collection for a second paired serology. microimmunofluorescence was used to detect Chlamydia species. a control visit performed one week after admission or coinciding with hospital discharge. we recorded the evolution of the episode with regards to clinical symptoms, physical examination, and treatment. the length of hospital stay and possible complications were also included. a, and sneezing), lower respiratory tract (cough and expectoration), and constitutional symptoms (dysthermia, fever, chills, asthenia, anorexia, headache, arthromyalgia, and impaired consciousness) Upon admission, the severity of the exacerbation was classified as the severity of COPD. anthropometric data were collected from each patient, and a chest radiograph was taken to rule out pneumonia. agglutination techniques were used to detect Mycoplasma pneumoniae. microimmunofluorescence was used to detect Chlamydia species. the different techniques performed are detailed below. conventional sputum Upon hospital admission, the sputum was collected upon spontaneous expectoration in a conventional manner with or without mucolytic agents. sputa were cultured only if the quality criteria were met in a sputum Gram stain (10 epithelial cells and >25 polymorphonuclear leukocytes) the realAccurateTM Respiratory RT-PCR kit (PathoFinder, Maastricht, Netherlands) was used for the nucleic acid and respiratory virus amplification test. the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN Iberia SL, Madrid, Spain) was used to extract RNA from clinical samples. 718 consecutive patients were admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of respiratory infection and dyspnea according to ICD-9-CM guidelines. we included 155 patients based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. 17 of the 148 remaining patients were excluded because the follow-up spirometry readings were not compatible with an infection.
