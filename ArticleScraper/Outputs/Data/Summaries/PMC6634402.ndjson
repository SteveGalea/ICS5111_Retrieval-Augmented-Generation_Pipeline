{"summary": "oral fluid sampling and testing offers a convenient, unobtrusive mechanism for evaluating the health status of swine, especially grower and finisher swine. results Based on the evaluation, oral fluid testing demonstrated value for both settings evaluated. the greatest value was in an outbreak scenario, where using oral fluids would minimize disruption of animal and farm activities, reduce sample sizes by 23%-40%, and decrease resource requirements. OF collection takes advantage of natural swine behavior. samples are collected by hanging cotton ropes in one or more pens in a barn. the ease of OF sample collection and the ability to obtain disease status information from an entire group with a single sample positions OF sampling as a strong methodology for on-farm surveillance. the matrix with the target virus may contain inhibitors that could prevent the assay from working. the abundance or concentration of the target virus in an OF sample is a host factor that depends on the organism concentration in an individual animal\u2019s oral fluid transudate. diseased animals may represent only a portion of the population in a particular pen of animals [9, 10] these hypothetical applications are used to inform how this sampling modality might be applied for surveillance in an outbreak and for early detection in a disease-free setting as a screening test. the hypothetical applications are used to inform how this sampling modality might be applied for surveillance in an outbreak and for early detection in a disease-free setting. scenario 1\u2013outbreak surveillance to support classification of premises status in a control area. scenario 2 \u2013outbreak surveillance within the surveillance zone to show no evidence of infection. animal movement testing was not evaluated due to information limitations, the complexity of different movement scenarios, and the high number of movement scenarios. the value of the information provided by OF sampling was measured by effectiveness. the surveillance target described the probability of detection that must be met for each scenario considered in the cost-effectiveness evaluation. the cost-effectiveness analysis is readily transferrable to additional pathogens or revised parameter estimates. the optimal sampling frequency with OF samples for ASF, CSF, or FMD has not been fully determined. the testing frequency is dependent on the incubation period of the given ASF, CSF, or FMD strain and the window of detection for the virus in OF samples. there is currently no evidence how persistently infected animals would relate to ASF or CSF detection in OF samples. a follow-up testing protocol was assumed to occur with initial non-negative results to rule out laboratory or test inconsistencies. the USDA reference laboratory was assumed to run the same type of rRT-PCR test on the referred OF sample with the same diagnostic specificity. used to determine sample size was conservatively assumed to range from 62% to 95% based on previously published values. the diagnostic test specificity used for these scenarios was estimated to be as low as 99% and as high as 99.99%. one example had the highest total swine population and one had the highest density of swine per premises. the pen size was assumed to be 25 swine per pen, 50\u201370 pens per barn, 1,250\u20131,750 swine per barn, 25\u201350 premises per control area, and 75\u2013150 premises per surveillance zone. the number of ropes per pen was held constant at one rope per pen [5]. testing for acute, highly pathogenic strains in the control area should occur on each premises every 5th day for the duration of the area quarantine or a minimum of 28 days. the 2013\u20132014 USDA documents do not outline the specific frequency or use of aggregate samples for testing. sampling frequency for a national-level early detection system was estimated at every 3 days, the ideal frequency to detect disease prior to clinical signs. scenario 4 was included to evaluate what level of detection could be achieved if sampling frequency reflected monitoring practices industry currently uses for endemic disease. a wide range of pen-level, premises-level, and population-level prevalence could be used to design a surveillance system. this project used examples of 20% infected pens per barn, 33% infected barns per premises, and 2% premises per zone/region/country sampled. the same detection threshold was used to evaluate probability of detection. cost of a false positive would be a minimum of $471 (CSF) to $540 (ASF or FMD), assuming samples are collected from one animal during an epidemiologic investigation. cost-effectiveness calculations are calculated by dividing the cost to acquire the same disease status information for scenarios 1 and 2. Scenarios We examined the hypothetical application, cost, and cost-effectiveness of information provided by OF sampling tested by rRT-PCR for ASF, CSF, or FMD surveillance in swine. scenarios 1 and 2 encompass surveillance in disease outbreak situations while scenarios 3 and 4 encompass surveillance activities in the absence of an outbreak. Scenarios 3 and 4 Early disease detection prior to clinical signs in a disease-free setting. two additional scenarios assessed were early disease detection to estimate the sample size needed to meet 0.95 probability of detection. Scenarios 3 and 4 Early disease detection prior to clinical signs in a disease-free setting. we calculated the probability of detecting disease prior to clinical signs using two different testing frequencies of a representative number of OF samples from the U.S. swine population. cost-effectiveness analysis is readily transferrable to additional pathogens or revised parameter estimates. we conducted a cost analysis for all four scenarios to estimate the total cost for each application of OF sampling and testing. we calculated the detectable prevalence based on industry\u2019s routine OF sampling efforts. the sample types listed are not exhaustive; the list includes those samples currently being used in an ASF, CSF, or FMD investigation or are being compared. there is currently no evidence on how persistently infected animals would relate to ASF or CSF detection in OF samples. d 2\u20133 d 1\u20133 d 2\u20133 d 1\u20134 d 2\u20137 d. a follow-up testing protocol was assumed to occur with initial non-negative results. the USDA reference laboratory was assumed to run the same type of rRT-PCR test on the referred OF sample with the same diagnostic specificity. 62\u201377% 100% Foot-and-mouth disease virus[7, 11, 23] 100% 100% 67\u201392% 81\u201395% 100% 100%. we selected two example counties in Iowa to model the large mock swine populations used in this assessment. one example had the highest total swine population (e.g., Sioux County with 1,177,164 swine) and one had the highest density of swine per premises. Characteristic values held in common across scenarios are summarized in Table 3. Characteristic values held in common across scenarios. Factor Value used Detection window in OF samples prior to clinical signs[7, 11, 13\u201316, 22] ASF 2\u20134 days CSF 0\u20131 days FMD 1\u20133 days Prevalence detection threshold[33] Premises level 2% Barn level 33% Pen level 20% Probability of detection 0.95 Diagnostic test sensitivity[7, 11, 23] 62\u201395% Diagnostic test testing for acute, highly pathogenic strains in the control area should occur on each premises every 5th day for the duration of the area quarantine or a minimum of 28 days. the 2013\u20132014 USDA documents do not outline the specific frequency or use of aggregate samples for testing, such as OF. clinical signs alone 41% of the time compared to relying on clinical signs alone for disease detection. scenario 4 was included to evaluate what level of detection could be achieved if sampling frequency reflected monitoring practices industry currently uses for endemic disease. probability of detection given disease is present was set at 0.95 for scenarios 1, 2 and 3. same detection threshold was used to evaluate what probability of detection could be achieved by this scenario. ASF may be detected in OF samples 2\u20134 days prior to clinical signs. CSF may be detected in OF concurrent to clinical signs, and FMD may be detected in OF samples 1\u20133 days prior to clinical signs. a follow-up testing protocol was assumed to occur with initial non-negative results to rule out laboratory or test inconsistencies. the USDA reference laboratory was assumed to run the same type of rRT-PCR test on the referred OF sample with the same diagnostic specificity. initiation of a full FAD investigation (to run confirmatory testing) would occur. we selected two example counties in Iowa to model the large mock swine populations used in this assessment. one had the highest total swine population (e.g., Sioux County with 1,177,164 swine) and one had the highest density of swine per premises (e.g., Wright County with an average 13,075 swine/operation) threshold[33] Premises level 2% Barn level 33% Pen level 20% Probability of detection 0.95 Diagnostic test sensitivity[7, 11, 23] 62\u201395% Diagnostic test specificity[7, 11, 23] 99\u201399.99% Pen size[5, 24] 25 head Barn size[5, 24] Pens 50\u201370 Animals 1250\u20131750 Barns per premises[5, 24] 3 barns Premises in 10-km control area[20, 21] 25\u201350 premises Premises in 10-km testing for acute, highly pathogenic strains should occur \"once during the first 3-week period of the area quarantine,\" then \"once during each additional 3-week period of the area quarantine\" the 2013\u20132014 USDA documents do not outline the specific frequency or use of aggregate samples for testing, such as OF. scenario 4 was included to evaluate what level of detection could be achieved if sampling frequency reflected monitoring practices industry currently uses for endemic disease. sample size characteristics We calculated sample sizes in Microsoft Excel using the Cannon formula to account for imperfect diagnostic test sensitivity. cost per OF sample tested is $5.56 per collection kit, $15 shipping and handling (assumption), and laboratory PCR testing fees of $32 to $35 per sample including possible accession fees. the total estimated cost per OF sample tested ranges from $55.56 to $62.56. a minimum of $471 (CSF) to $540 (ASF or FMD) assuming samples are collected from one animal during an epidemiologic investigation. these costs exclude any domestic business or trade impacts. cost analysis calculations Several dimensions contribute to the calculations for the overall cost range. if an oral fluids sample has a non-negative result after follow-up testing at NVSL, an FAD investigation will be initiated and confirmatory testing will be performed at the NVSL Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory. the total cost of a false positive would be a minimum of $471 (CSF) to $540 (ASF or FMD), assuming samples are collected from one animal during an epidemiologic investigation. cost-effectiveness is calculated by dividing the cost of a surveillance option by its associated cost; a lower cost-effectiveness ratio is preferred as it is considered more cost-effective. scenario 4 includes the prevalence that can be detected using common industry practices. cost including follow up costs for non-negative samples 7 $900,000 to $3,150,000 $219,650 to $1,290,170 $34,261,050 to $93,254,250 $9,050,950 to $9,150,760 1 Range of samples represents the full range from previously outlined low and high sensitivity values. 3Assumes equal distribution of rope samples among 3 barns per premises and the full range of sensitivity values. for the duration of the outbreak would be much lower for OF sampling (36\u201363 samples per premises) than individual animal sampling (157 samples per premises) to achieve 0.95 detection probability. difference translates to requiring OF sample levels of 23% to 40% of the individual animal sampling levels to acquire the same disease status information. the average number of samples currently submitted to two large swine veterinary diagnostic laboratories per year is approximately 181,000. the cost savings following scenario 4 range from $193,600 to $342,700, which is approximately 88% to 89% lower than scenario 3. assumed prevalence detection thresholds of 20% infected pens/barn, 33% infected barns/premises, and 2% premises per zone prevalence in a control area or surveillance zone. a premises designation within the control area requires objective information on disease status before a premises may be considered for a different designation. a premises designation within the control area requires objective information on disease status before a premises may be considered for a different designation. Depending on the test sensitivity, the number of samples required could range from 685,152 to 1,844,640 at a cost of between $34,257,600 and $92,22,000. with a test specificity ranging from 99 to 99.99%, the number of false positives to undergo follow-up testing would be expected to range from 69 to 18,447. the average number of samples currently submitted to two large swine veterinary diagnostic laboratories per year is approximately 181,000. a sample size of 16 ropes provides a probability of 0.51 of detecting at least one infected premises when 2% of the premises are infected. a sample size of 16 ropes provides a probability of 0.76 of detecting at least one infected premises when 2% of the premises are infected. the number of samples required could range from 685,152 to 1,844,640 at a cost of between $34,257,600 and $92,232,000. the cost savings following scenario 4 range from $193,600 to $342,700. the ability to detect an infected premises is decreased compared to scenario 3. a sample size of 10 ropes only provides a probability of 0.51 of detecting at least one infected premises when 2% of the premises are infected. the actual test utility will largely depend on the results of test validation studies. in both scenarios 1 and 2, the cost-effectiveness ratio of aggregate OF samples is lower than individual animal sampling. OF sample testing could decrease resource utilization. orally, and the duration of sampling is limited by a known period of exposure and a foreseeable end-date (the end of the quarantine) oral fluid sampling may be highly efficacious in this scenario if the benefit of preventing disease spread is greater than the cost of a short but intensive sampling scheme. clinical signs, if seen at all, present at the same time as detectable virus in OF samples. if viral shedding occurs before detectable clinical signs for ASF, CSF, or FMD are observed, the frequency of sampling could be decreased. a higher number of samples submitted per barn could achieve 0.95 probability of detection. OF sample testing could contribute to emergency preparedness and response efforts directed toward ASF, CSF, or FMD in swine. the use of aggregate screening samples would minimize the disruption of animal and farm activities, reduce sample sizes, and decrease resource requirements compared to individual animal sampling regimens. in both scenarios 1 and 2, the cost-effectiveness ratio of aggregate OF samples is lower than individual animal sampling. however, OF sample testing could decrease resource utilization. this approach could decrease resource costs associated with personal protective equipment, waste disposal, and personnel downtime between farms. early detection scenario was designed with 0.95 probability of detecting at least one infected premises prior to clinical signs. scenario assumed sample collection occurred approximately every 3 days to detect disease prior to clinical signs. this scenario could be modified to lower levels of sampling for different goals. a higher number of samples submitted per barn or sampling a greater number of premises could achieve 0.95 probability of detection. a higher number of samples submitted per barn or sampling a greater number of premises could achieve 0.95 probability of detection. scenario presented assumed that each premises collected samples weekly and that the submissions were distributed throughout a given week to temporally space submissions. test validation efforts through positive and negative cohort studies would improve the broader understanding of OF sample testing by rRT-PCR for ASF, CSF, or FMD in swine. this evaluation should be revised if additional studies provide new or updated information about ASF, CSF, or FMD pathogenesis. clinical signs, if seen at all, present at the same time as detectable virus in OF samples. if viral shedding occurs before detectable clinical signs for ASF, CSF, or FMD are observed, the frequency of sampling could be decreased. a higher number of samples submitted per barn could achieve 0.95 probability of detection. OF sample testing could contribute to emergency preparedness and response efforts directed toward ASF, CSF, or FMD in swine. the use of aggregate screening samples would minimize the disruption of animal and farm activities, reduce sample sizes, and decrease resource requirements."}
