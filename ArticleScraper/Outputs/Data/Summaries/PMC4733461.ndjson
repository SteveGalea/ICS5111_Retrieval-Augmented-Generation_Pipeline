{"summary": "influenza virus is a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia, according to the world health organization. virus are a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia, according to the world health organization. systemic steroids are proposed as a valid therapeutic option due to their potential role in controlling host inflammatory response. influenza is an acute respiratory disease that presents with sudden onset of high fevers, upper respiratory tract symptoms, chills, myalgia and gastrointestinal tract symptoms. pandemic H1N1 infected patients presented with fever, cough and sore throat and the most severe case rapidly developed bilateral pneumonia, severe ARDS, multiple organ failure and death. corticosteroids are cyclic organic compounds physiologically secreted by zona fasciculata cells of the adrenal cortex. corticotropin (ACTH) is very sensitive to negative feedback by the circulating cortisol and exogenous (synthetic) glucocorticoids. corticosteroids are metabolized through complexly regulated enzymatic transformations in the liver and kidney [through 11- hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11- corticotropin-releasing hormone stimulates the production of ACTH by the anterior pituitary gland, causing a sustained increase in cortisol secretion. this increased cortisol production originates multiple effects (metabolic, cardiovascular and immune) aimed at restoring homeostasis during stress. corticosteroids stress doses in critically ill patients are at least three times too high. despite this, a standard steroid and dose regimen are not well established. therapy with steroids in severe infections has shown to be beneficial in a pair of clinical situations. Xi et al[34] retrospectively evaluated data from 155 adults with confirmed H1N1 infection in china, one-third (33.5%) were treated with steroids. in a multivariate analysis, the use of steroids was associated with a trend towards increased hospital mortality. however, patients using steroids were often more severely ill. not responding to antiviral therapy Methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg per day Clinical improvement Cornejo et al[40] Case report Two patients with H1N1 that developed organizing pneumonia Methylprednisolone 500 mg/d for 3 d Clinical improvement Diaz et al[37] Multicenter, prospective cohort 372 patients with primary H1H1 pandemic pneumonia, 136 receiving steroids Not reported Corticosteroid therapy was not significantly associated with multicenter, prospective cohort study 37 survivors of ARDS due to H1N1 infection. 126 with steroid treatment at ICU admission Minimal equivalent dose of 24 mg/d (methylprednisolone) or 30 mg/d (prednisone) a higher incidence of hospital-acquired pneumonia was noted in patients receiving early steroid therapy. the crude 90-d mortality for the 107 (43.6%) patients who received steroids was higher than in the patients who did not receive steroids. the association between steroid therapy and death remains significant. corticosteroid tends to be used in the sickest case-patients. the timing and dose of corticosteroid therapy were not controlled in the study. no specific drug regimen has been suggested in this context. corticosteroid effect was not addressed in this small open-label randomized controlled trial as every patient enrolled received corticosteroids. the corticosteroid effect per se was not addressed in this small open-label randomized controlled trial as every patient enrolled received corticosteroids. three influenza pandemics occurred in the 20th century[5,7]: 1918 (Spanish influenza), 1957 (Asian influenza) and 1968 (Hong Kong influenza) different antigenic subtypes of influenza A caused them, each resulting in more than a million deaths. in 2009, a pandemic H1N1 virus developed by reassortment among several influenza strains. hypercytokinemia and a proinflammatory state are related to disease severity in influenza infections. the proinflammatory properties of lectin and anti-inflammatory properties of adiponectin may increase the risk of developing hypoxemic respiratory failure. corticosteroids in critical illness have existed since the early decades of the 20th century[19] every acute physical stress or noxious stimuli results in a coordinated systemic response classically referred to as stress response or general adaption syndrome. corticotropin-driven cortisol production originates multiple effects (metabolic, cardiovascular and immune) aimed at restoring homeostasis during stress[22,23] cortisol plasmatic levels were not consistently elevated after exogenous corticotropin stimulation. the reduction of cortisol metabolism during critical illness emerged as an alternative mechanism. recent data showed suppression of activity of cortisol metabolizing enzymes. the role of steroids as adjunctive therapy in influenza is very attractive theoretical approach to try to modulate hypercytokinemia associated with the most severe presentation[4]. a balance must occur between this phenomenon and the possibility of prolonged viral replication, resulting in more direct cytopathic effect on the infected lungs[32]. 143 hematopoietic cell transplant patients with seasonal influenza Prednisone 1 mg/kg per day (low dose) or prednisone > 1 mg/kg per day (high dose) Steroid use not associated with lower respiratory disease, hypoxemia, need for MV or death. 83 receiving steroids Hydrocortisone 270 mg/d (median) for 11 d (median) nisolone equivalent of 50 mg/d (use for fever reduction) to 61 mg/d (use for pneumonia) early steroid treatment ( 72 h) was associated with development of critical disease compared with who received late (> 72 h) or no steroid treatment. patients who received early steroid therapy were sicker than who did not receive them according to SAPS 3 (55.9 16.8 vs 49.0 14.5; P = 0.001) 12 patients improved lung function, were extubated and discharged alive from the ICU By day 7 of treatment patients experienced a significant improvement in lung injury and multiple organ dysfunction scores. 208 patients with severe H1N1 infections and ARDS were evaluated in a multicenter study in france. steroids were administered to 39.9% and, after using several analytical techniques to adjust for differences in steroid-treated patients to compare clinical outcomes, the association between steroid therapy and death remained significant. a conclusive trial on corticosteroids in severe H1N1 infection would be difficult or even impossible to perform. it is reasonable to conclude that corticosteroids failed to demonstrate any clinical impact in severe influenza infection and, in addition, the data points to potential harm. corticosteroids failed to demonstrate any beneficial effects in the treatment of patients with severe influenza infection. corticosteroids may be associated with higher incidence of hospital-acquired pneumonia and longer duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay."}
