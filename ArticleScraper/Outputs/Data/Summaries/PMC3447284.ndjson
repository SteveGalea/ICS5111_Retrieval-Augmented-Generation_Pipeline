{"summary": "pig populations in most other countries are endemically infected with different swine adapted subtypes of influenza A virus [4\u20136] pig populations in most other countries are endemically infected with different swine adapted subtypes of influenza A virus. a case-control study performed on a nave Norwegian pig subpopulation consisting of all nucleus and multiplier herds. the study population comprised all 118 Norwegian nucleus and multiplier herds, which were all farrow-to-finish herds. the herds were tested serologically for Influenza A specific NP antibodies by ELISA. all farmers who reported clinical signs were asked to report if they had observed signs of coughing, sneezing, depression, decrease in feed intake, or increase in reproductive disturbances in their pigs. in Norway all nucleus and multiplier herds must keep written records of all treatments irrespective of whether they were performed by a veterinarian or herd personnel. the questionnaire was distributed by surface mail in the middle of November 2010. a letter was enclosed with the questionnaire encouraging the farmers to familiarize themselves with the questions and informing them that they would be asked to answer the questionnaire in a telephone interview within the following weeks. a paper copy of the questionnaire was used to register the answers for each interview. a questionnaire of 137 questions was created to record demographics, husbandry information on the herds, and variables of interest. all farmers, regardless of whether they represented case or control herds, were asked to report if they had observed signs of coughing, sneezing, depression, decrease in feed intake, or increase in reproductive disturbance. the questionnaire was distributed by surface mail in the middle of November 2010. farmers were asked to indicate the severity of observed clinical signs. but difficulties defining degrees of severity led to a simplified binomial classification. in the study population, 100 herds (87%) had batch farrowing. the distribution of number of weeks between batches was 1 (1 herd), 2 (1 herd), 3 (32 herds), 5.5 (19 herds), and 7 (47 herds) nineteen (40%) (95% CI of 26\u201355%) of the 48 positive herds reported clinical signs in one or more age groups. n = 17 Unweaned piglets, n = 8 Weaned piglets, n = 6 Growers, finishers, recruit sows, n = 8 Coughing 5 (29.4) 5 (62.5) 6 (100) 5 (62.5) Sneezing 4 (23.5) 4 (50.0) 5 (83.3) 4 (50.0) Lethargy 7 (41.2) 3 (37.5) 2 (33.3) 2 (25.0) Decreased feed intake 12 (70.6 the results for sows are divided in two groups, one for herds that reported reproductive disturbances and one for herds that did not report reproductive disturbances. the results of the reported duration in different age groups are shown in Table 3. Table 3. Duration of clinical signs in herds with reported signs of pig-influenza-like illness. the interviews took place approximately one year after the first incursion of pandemic influenza A (2009) virus. farmers were also likely to have a heightened awareness and report clinical signs beyond the normal situation. farmers were encouraged to review these records in a letter enclosed with the questionnaire before the interview. the proportion of infection was approximately the same in both closed, self-replacing nucleus herds and multiplier herds that buy replacement sows from nucleus herds. this supports that introduction of new pigs was unlikely to be the primary source of infection on farms, as previously described by Hofshagen et al. the direct role of swine influenza virus in abortions is unclear. pyrexia was not emphasized as it was unclear how many farmers routinely checked the rectal temperature of the pigs. the proportion of observed clinical signs varied between herds and age groups. the reported duration most likely reflects on presented clinical signs within a herd level or epidemiological unit. pig-to-pig transmission after introduction of virus will often be observed and recorded for some time after the acute signs have subsided."}
