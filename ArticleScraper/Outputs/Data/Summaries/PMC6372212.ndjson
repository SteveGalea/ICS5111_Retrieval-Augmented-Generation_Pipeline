{"summary": "the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes in vertebrates encode cell surface proteins. the MHC region is one of the most polymorphic gene clusters in vertebrate genomes. this indicates that other MHC-related factors contribute to the capacity of human populations to withstand pathogens. authors found that the self-peptide\u2013binding repertoire of HLA-B shapes the native repertoire of T-cell clones developed in the thymus. their results could explain why individuals carrying HLA-B*57 alleles can maintain low HIV RNA without therapy. the authors suggested that the breadth of epitope-binding repertoire shapes genetic susceptibility to Marek\u2019s disease virus in chickens and HIV disease progression in humans. we first focused on the human HLA class II DRB1 gene, for several reasons. first, we focused on the human HLA class II gene, with over 2,000 registered alleles [19] together with HLA-DRA, HLA-DRA encodes the heterodimeric HLA-DR protein complex, but HLA-DRA is basically invariant. we also evaluated promiscuity patterns of HLA class I molecules. the set of investigated epitopes was derived from the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) and contains 2,691 peptide epitope epitopes of 71 pathogens known to be bound by certain HLA class II alleles. most included epitopes are 15 to 20 amino acids long and are found in only one of the 71 pathogens. promiscuous HLA-DRB1 alleles can present epitopes from a broader range of pathogen species (S5 Fig). Using the global infectious diseases and epidemiology network (GIDEON), we compiled a dataset on pathogen richness in the corresponding 43 countries. it consists of 95 diseases caused by 168 extracellular pathogens. it consists of diverse bacterial species, fungi, protozoa, and helminthes. the dataset and methodology employed for the analysis are standardized. no significant correlation was found between intracellular pathogen diversity and (B) predicted and (D) in vitro promiscuity at the HLA-DRB1 locus (Spearman\u2019s rho: 0.04 and 0.21, P = 0.81 and 0.29, respectively) HLA-DRB1*12:02 has an exceptionally high promiscuity level compared with other alleles. the figure shows alleles with at least 10% frequency in at least one population in Southeast Asia. the figure shows alleles with at least 10% frequency in at least one population in Southeast Asia. to investigate this issue, we combined an established phylogeny of HLA-DRB1 alleles with predicted epitope-binding promiscuity values. to investigate this issue, we selected a set of 96 HLA-DRB1 alleles with a detectable frequency in at least one human population. a comparison of all pairs of these alleles revealed that even very closely related alleles show major differences in promiscuity levels. sequence variability of an amino acid site in the epitope-binding region of HLA-DRB1 correlates positively with the site\u2019s promiscuity fragility. the same result was obtained when promiscuity fragility was calculated based on nucleotide substitutions instead of amino acid substitutions. amino acid positions with a large impact on epitope-binding promiscuity are highly variable in human populations. those sites in the epitope-binding region that are under positive selection tend to have high promiscuity fragility values. mutations at amino acid site numbers 9 and 47 do not seriously affect promiscuity level. we first used established bioinformatics tools to predict binding affinities of experimentally verified epitope peptides. most included epitopes are 15 to 20 amino acids long and are found in only one of the 71 pathogens (S1 Fig, S1 Data) promiscuous HLA-DRB1 alleles can present epitopes from a broader range of pathogen species. no correlation between promiscuity values and the amount of data per allele used for the training of the algorithm. Epidemiology Network (GIDEON) compiled a dataset on pathogen richness. it consists of 95 diseases caused by 168 extracellular pathogens. it consists of diverse bacterial species, fungi, protozoa, and helminthes. no significant correlation was found between intracellular pathogen diversity and (B) predicted and (D) in vitro promiscuity at the HLA-DRB1 locus (Spearman\u2019s rho: 0.04 and 0.21, P = 0.81 and 0.29, respectively) the high frequency of HLA-DRB1*12:02 has been previously suggested to reflect pathogen-driven selection during the migration of a Mongolian population to South China. this allele is associated with protection from recurrent pulmonary tuberculosis, recurrent typhoid fever, and hepatosplenic schistomiasis. to investigate this issue, we combined an established phylogeny of HLA-DRB1 alleles with predicted epitope-binding promiscuity values. alleles with a high promiscuity level have a patchy distribution across the tree (S6 Fig), indicating that high promiscuity has multiple independent origins. sequence variability of an amino acid site in the epitope-binding region of HLA-DRB1 correlates positively with the site\u2019s promiscuity fragility. the same result was obtained when promiscuity fragility was calculated based on nucleotide substitutions instead of amino acid substitutions. a strong positive correlation was found between Shannon entropy and promiscuity fragility. amino acid positions with a large impact on epitope-binding promiscuity are highly variable in human populations. those sites in the epitope-binding region that are under positive selection tend to have high promiscuity fragility values. no marked positive correlation was found for two other MHC genes. other unrelated evolutionary forces may shape the geographical distribution of promiscuous HLA-B and HLA-C alleles. the genomic region encoding these MHC molecules is of special interest. HLA-DRB1*12:02 is a promiscuous allele that has been associated with protection from certain infectious diseases. it is well established that antigens presented by HLA class II molecules derive mainly from extracellular proteins. however, HLA class II molecules have well-established roles in controlling immune response against viruses. the impact of MHC promiscuity level on population allelic diversity is an interesting area for future research. we note that the most promiscuous HLA-DRB1 alleles are rare in certain human populations. this suggests that these alleles are not particularly favored by natural selection in these areas. epitopes of all available viral, bacterial, and eukaryotic pathogens bound by at least one HLA-I or HLA-II allele were extracted from IEDB. only epitopes of these species were analyzed further. all 162 HLA-DRB1 alleles are present in at least one of the human populations studied here. a binding affinity threshold of 50 nM was applied, yielding peptides that are likely to be immunodominant [39]. for alternative binding threshold definitions, see S4 Fig. we excluded IHWG populations reported to deviate from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. populations reported in multiple databases were included only once in the analysis. we grouped populations with highly similar HLA allele compositions. a genetic distance matrix was generated using allele frequency data of the examined locus. we used the Rogers genetic distance measure [75] because it does not assume that allele frequency changes are driven by genetic drift only. populations were merged using a network-based approach. ative species or genera were classified into obligate intracellular and extracellular pathogen groups based on a previous study. putative facultative intracellular pathogens were excluded from the analysis. extracellular and intracellular pathogen diversity of each country was approximated by the number of identified endemic extracellular and intracellular species. each resulting paper containing HLA association data was examined. association was classified as beneficial or detrimental, if all related studies supported the beneficial or detrimental role of HLA allele/allele group. protein sequence alignment resulted in 96 alleles. multiple alignment of nucleotide sequences was performed. epitope-binding region sites were excluded when calculating amino acid distance. nonsynonymous nucleotide diversity (A) measures the average number of nonsynonymous nucleotide differences per nonsynonymous site between two randomly chosen protein coding DNA sequences from the same population. nucleotide sequences of DRB1 alleles were downloaded from the IPD-IMGT/HLA database [19] we calculated promiscuity fragility based on each nonsynonymous nucleotide substitution of the codon instead of each amino acid substitution of the site. we also calculated promiscuity fragility based on each nonsynonymous nucleotide substitution of the site. affinities of the remaining 3,265 HLA-I epitope sequences to 346 HLA-A, 532 HLA-B and 225 HLA-C alleles were predicted with the NetMHCpan-4.0 algorithm. binding of 2,691 HLA-II epitope sequences to 162 HLA-DRB1 alleles was predicted using the netMHCIIpan-4.0 algorithm. allele frequency data of the 14th and 16th IHIW populations were downloaded from dbMHC. population-level promiscuity values were calculated by averaging promiscuity values of alleles weighted by their relative frequencies. we merged populations with highly similar HLA allele compositions. populations were treated as nodes and two nodes were connected if their genetic distance was under a cutoff value. population groups were treated as independent data points in subsequent statistical analyses. pathogen diversity Data on 309 infectious diseases were collected from GIDEON [41] for each disease, the number of causative species or genera was determined using disease information in the GIDEON database. extracellular and intracellular pathogen diversity of each country was approximated by the number of identified endemic extracellular and intracellular species. dr12, \u201cassoc* drb1*12\u201d, \u201cassoc* drb1*03\u201d, \u201cassoc* dr3\u201d, \u201cinfect* drb1*12\u201d, \u201cinfect* drb1 03 01\u201d, \u201cinfect* drb1 03 01\u201d, \u201cinfect* dr3\u201d, \u201cinfect* dr1*03\u201d and \u201cinfect* dr17\u201d. nucleotide sequences of DRB1 alleles contained full exon 2 and 3 regions were downloaded from the IPD-IMGT/HLA database [19] to limit our analyses to alleles that have an impact on the inferred promiscuity level of a population. we considered only those sequences that had a nonzero frequency in at least one human population. nucleotide diversity (A) measures the average number of nonsynonymous nucleotide differences per nonsynonymous site between two randomly chosen protein coding DNA sequences from the same population. nucleotide diversity (A) measures the average number of nonsynonymous nucleotide differences per nonsynonymous site. promiscuity was predicted for each 19 possible amino acid change along the epitope-binding region of each of 96 alleles. the fold difference in promiscuity resulting from each amino acid change was calculated. the median promiscuity fold difference of each possible allele was used to estimate promiscuity fragility at each amino acid position. in vitro and predicted promiscuity of the 11 alleles was determined at a 50 nM binding threshold using the selected 216 and 2,665 epitopes. the proportion of 2,691 epitopes bound by HLA-DRB1 alleles showed strong correlation. promiscuity values were calculated using an alternative algorithm, MHC2SKPan. the proportion of epitopes bound by HLA-DRB1 molecules was independent of the exact epitope set used for the calculations. promiscuity values are represented in log scale in panels A\u2013C. underlying data for this figure can be found in S4 Data. phylogeny of DRB1 alleles from Yasukochi and colleagues [47] indicates rapid and frequent changes in promiscuity. dN/dS value (a common measure of positive selection) of an amino acid site in the epitope-binding region of HLA-DRB1 correlates positively with the site\u2019s promiscuity fragility. promiscuity scores were calculated based on standardized (i.e., z-score) allele promiscuity values and were averaged in each population group. population groups were created using the 15th percentile genetic distance cutoff. for results of multivariate models and obtained upon using alternative distance cutoff values, see S6 Data.
