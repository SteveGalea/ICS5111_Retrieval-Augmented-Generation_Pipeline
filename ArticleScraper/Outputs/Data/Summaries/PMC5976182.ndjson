{"summary": "the urgent need for guidance and the paucity of structured scientific data on emerging diseases hinder the formulation of evidence-informed recommendations using standard methods and procedures. Objectives We selected four recent infectious disease emergencies: outbreaks of avian influenza A\u2014H1N1 virus (2009) and H7N9 virus (2013). adherence to the principles and standards for high-quality, trustworthy and usable guidelines is essential so that end-users adopting and implementing recommendations in the field can optimally impact population health outcomes. the best way to apply traditional quality standards for guidelines to the context of emergencies remains unclear. there were other outbreaks, humanitarian emergencies, and natural disasters between 2009 and 2016 that were graded by the Global Emergency Management Team. we included all information products published in any language that was specifically developed or adapted by WHO for the four selected emergencies. we excluded testimonials, media releases, situation reports and meeting reports. the most widely-used guideline quality appraisal tool is comprised of 23 items, six quality domains and a 7-point Likert-like response scale. for continuous data, we report the prevalence of key characteristics for information products in each emergency. two independent reviewers assessed each document against study inclusion criteria. guidelines included products that contained recommendations and did not reference an underlying, source guideline. non-guidelines are expected to contain detailed methods and other types of information that is expected in a high-quality guideline. we identify 175 information products of which 87 were classified as guidelines. table 1 outlines the methods and processes used in the development of guidelines. data represent number (%) unless otherwise indicated. included the WHO logo a 14 (93) 34 (92) 3 (60) 8 (89) 13 (81) 6 (86) 51 (98) 31 (97) Guideline development processes in recent public health emergencies. external contributors 4 (27) 1 (20) 4 (25) 10 (19) Peer review conducted 2 (13) 0 (0) 6 (38) 5 (10) States the date of expiration or planned update 8 (53) 0 (0) 3 (19) 4 (8) States the source of funding 0 (0) 0 (0) 5 (10) Approved by the WHO Guidelines Review Committee 1 (7) 0 (0) 0 (0) 2 (4) EVD, Ebola virus disease; MERS-CoV, Middle East Res the AGREE II domains are displayed along the horizontal axis. the data points are the median, interquartile range, and minimum and maximum standardized scores based on the scores of the two reviewers for each domain and outbreak. none of the guidelines that reported involving external experts provided a date of expiration or planned update. EVD We included 84 EVD information products, including 52 emergency guidelines and 32 other information products. the lowest scores were editorial independence (median 0%; IQR 0%-0%) and scope and purpose (median 76%; IQR 53%-78%). AGREE II scaled domain scores of guidelines developed for H1N1, H7N9, MERS-CoV and EVD. EVD, Ebola virus disease; MERS-CoV, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus. guideline referenced a systematic review; another cited evidence, but did not indicate whether the evidence review was systematic. none of the guidelines provided a date of expiration or planned update. the lowest-scoring AGREE II domains were rigor of development. 42 (50%) information products were available in English and French. only two guidelines reported or referenced a systematic review. most guidelines (81%) cited other publications, including other WHO information products. the principles for trustworthy guidelines were developed in the context of standard (non-emergency) clinical guidelines where there is a much longer time-period for development. end-users\u2019 needs may be much clearer, there may be much more (high-quality) evidence. the implementation setting and health systems may be much less fragile and chaotic. disclosure is widely regarded as the first step in addressing competing interests. the specific reasons were unclear, although pressure to produce guidelines quickly could lead to ad hoc and variable processes and procedures. rigour of development of guidelines examined in our study appears to be low. high scores in the AGREE II domains of clarity of presentation and scope and purpose may be attributable to the operational focus of most emergency guidelines. guidelines scored inconsistently in the domain of applicability, which includes criteria such as descriptions of barriers to implementation of the recommendations, and provision of or reference to other tools to support implementation. study did not intend to compare guidelines for the four responses with each other or with standard WHO guidelines developed in stable settings. guidelines produced in the context of a public health emergency can be improved upon, helping to assure the trustworthiness and utility of WHO information products in future emergencies."}
