{"summary": "bovine rotavirus group A (BRV) commonly occurs in calves 1-8 weeks of age. it is the main cause of mortality in calves and leads to increase treatment cost and reduces growth rate in calve. the VP4 protein has a molecular mass of 88 kDa and it is presented as a series of spikes with 10-12 nm in length. the protein is cleaved by proteolytic enzyme trypsin cleavage of V4 produces fragments VP8 (N-terminal region) and VP5 (C-terminal region), which have molecular mass of 28 kDa and 60 kDa. chimeric recombinant antigens are economical to introduce and produce an effective multivalent vaccine. the chimeric VP8-S2 antigen was cloned and sub-cloned into pGH and pET32a(+) plasmid pET32a(+) was purchased from Novagen. restriction enzymes, Taq DNA polymerase and T4 ligase were purchased from thermo. oligonucleotides were provided from macrogen (South Korea) the epitopes of the VP8 and S2 protein were screened using an online antigen prediction server VaxiJen v2.0 server (http://www.ddg-pharmfac.net/vaxijen/VaxiJen/VaxiJen.html). the gene sequence was codon optimized for expression in E.coli by GENEray. the pGH-VP8-S2 recombinant plasmid was double digested by BamHI and XohI enzymes. the pET32a(+)-VP8-S2 plasmid was ligated 16 h at 16\u00b0C into pET32a(+) vector. the pET32a(+)-VP8-S2 expression plasmid was transformed into E.coli strain TOP10F' cell tubes were centrifuged for 5 min at 4000 rpm and 18 L of the supernatant was used as template in PCR reaction. PCR reaction was carried out in total volume of 25.2L containing 1.5 mM MgCl2 (1.5 L), 50 mM buffer 10X(2.5 L), 0.2 mM of each of the 4 nucleotide dNTPs(2L),100 pM of T7 primer(1 L), 100 ng of fresh LB liquid (50 ml) containing 100 g/mL ampicillin was incubated by 5ml of pre-culture. culture was induced by 1mM IPTG and incubated at 37\u00b0C. cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8000 rpm at 4\u00b0C for 10 min. lysate was centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 20 min at room temperature. we added 1ml of the 50% Ni-NTA slurry to 4 ml lysate. the recombinant protein was washed once with 4ml of buffer C. nitrocellulose membrane was washed four times for five minutes each time in PBST. membrane was washed four times for five minutes each time in PBST. color development was observed by adding diaminobenzidine dissolved in PBS and H2O2. supplementary criteria such as antigenicity, hydrophobicity, accessibility and flexibility were used in epitope characterization. fragments that involve high density of immune-dominant epitopes were selected for each of the antigens. gene sequence was codon optimized for expression in E.coli by GENEray. codon optimization of sequence does not change amino acids coded by DNA. pGH-VP8-S2 plasmid was double digested by BamHI and XohI enzymes. the recombinant pET32a(+)-VP8-S2 vector was transformed into E.coli strain TOP10F' cell. the plasmids were screened by PCR colony and digestion of miniprep plasmid by BamHI and XohI enzymes. agarose gel stained with ethidiumboromide and visualized under a UV light and photographed with an UVidoc GEL Documentation System (UVitec, UK) gene expression of the VP8-S2 in E.coli E.coli BL21 CondonPlus (DE3) harboring the recombinant pET32a(+)-VP8-S2 vector was grown in Luria broth (LB) culture supplemented with 100 g/mL ampicillin and supernatant and pellets were investigated to find where the supernatant contained the soluble VP8-S2 or insoluble VP8-S2 was present in the pellet. the recombinant protein was purified based on manufacturer\u2019s instructions Qiagen nickel- nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) agarose column (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) the recombinant VP8-S2 protein (2g) was induced by 1mM IPTG. the extract of the transformed bacteria uninduced by IPTG and PBS were dot-blotted on nitrocellulose membrane. the membrane was immersed in 1% bovine serum albumin and was shaken into incubator for thirty minutes. antigen number Final epitope after filtration VaxiJen score VP8 1 8QLLYNSYSVDLSDEITNIGAEK29 0.72* VP8 2 180ADTQGDLRVGTYSNPVPNAVV200 0.57* VP8 3
