{"summary": "Adeno-associated viruses are non-enveloped viruses with a 4.7 kb ssDNA genome packaged into an 25 nm diameter icosahedral capsid. several of the 12 currently identified AAV serotypes are under investigation as vectors for therapeutic gene delivery due to features that make them potentially attractive vectors. both of these serotypes utilize sialic acids as their primary cellular receptors and AAV5 also binds to the platelet-derived growth factor receptor as a co-receptor. cellular immunity leading to virus neutralization has been recognized as a major barrier to clinical trials involving AAV in humans. despite the importance of antibodies in the host response to AAV, relatively little is known about the major antigenic epitopes on the capsid surface or the mechanism(s of antibody neutralization. antibodies may neutralize viruses by a variety of mechanisms that include capsid cross-linking, the direct or steric inhibition of receptor binding, the prevention or premature triggering of conformational changes necessary for infection. studies of AAV2 examining a small number of mAbs or polyclonal anti-capsid antibodies show that antibody binding is affected by changes in a small number of amino acid positions within variable loops on the capsid surface. mutations in some of the sites that eliminated antibody binding also altered the receptor-binding properties by reducing association with heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) antibody production Panels of mAbs were prepared against AAV1 and AAV5 virus-like particles (VLPs) using two different immunization strategies. the first involved repeated immunization of AAV1 VLPs 2\u20133 months prior to a final intravenous immunization 3 days prior to the fusion of the splenic lymphocytes. this protocol resulted in the production of three IgG- and four IgM-secreting hybridomas IgM antibodies tested for cross-reactivity in dot-blot analysis. antibody was raised against AAV2 and recognizes a linear epitope present in all AAVs tested except AAV4. anti-AAV1 and anti-AAV5 mAbs cross-react only with AAV6 capsids. no cross-reactivity is seen with the anti-AAV5 antibodies (3C5, 8F1 and 9F7). the 4E4 IgG, generated against AAV1, was the most efficient and neutralized at 50- and 500-fold lower concentrations compared with the 5H7 and 9A8 antibodies. the 5H7 and 9A8 Fab fragments reached 50 % neutralization only at the highest concentration tested. control IgGs and Fabs directed against canine parvovirus or BSA were non-neutralizing when added under the same conditions as in (a\u2013c) control IgGs and Fabs directed against canine parvovirus or BSA were non-neutralizing when added under the same conditions as in (a\u2013c) serial dilutions of the anti-AAV1 IgGs (a) or Fabs (b) were pre-incubated with Alexa-488 fluorescently labelled AAV1 VLPs, then inoculated onto Cos-1 cells. Flow cytometry was used to determine the level of cell-associated virus and was compared with a no-antibody control. of the anti-AAV1 antibodies, only the 4E4 IgG gave >50 % serial dilutions of the anti-AAV1 IgGs (a) or Fabs (b) were added for 1 h, then cells were washed prior to warming to 37 \u00b0C. cells were scored for GFP expression after 48 h by flow cytometry and data compared to a no-antibody control. IgM antibodies tested for cross-reactivity with different AAV serotypes. cross-reactivity between the hybridoma supernatant from a subset of the AAV1 and AAV5 mAbs was tested by ELISA. anti-AAV1 antibodies cross-react only with AAV6 capsids. mAbs recognized conformational epitopes on assembled capsids. they did not react with AAV2, AAV4, AAV5, AAV7, AAV8 and AAV9. no cross-reactivity is seen with the anti-AAV5 antibodies. mAb neutralization Neutralization titres were defined as the dilutions that resulted in 50 % reductions of cellular transduction by AAV1 and AAV5 vectors packaging the GFP-gene. transduction was scored as the percentage of GFP-expressing cells 48 h post-inoculation. all of the antibodies neutralized as intact IgGs although with different efficiencies. control IgGs and Fabs directed against canine parvovirus or BSA were non-neutralizing when added under the same conditions as in (a\u2013c) control IgGs and Fabs were non-neutralizing when added under the same conditions as in (a\u2013c) control IgGs and Fabs were non-neutralizing when added under the same conditions as in (a\u2013c) Fab of the 5H7 antibody reduced the level of virus binding to 80 % of control levels. Neither the anti-AAV5 3C5 IgG nor Fab fragment reduced the level of virus binding to 80 % of control levels. control antibodies did not inhibit the viruses\u2019 ability to attach to cells. serial dilutions of the anti-AAV1 and anti-AAV5 mAbs were tested for the ability to neutralize at a post-attachment step. rAAV1\u2013GFP capsids were inoculated onto Cos-1 cells at 4 \u00b0C to allow attachment but not endocytosis. the anti-AAV5 antibodies showed only weak cross-reactivity with AAV1. the mice were immunized twice with AAV1 and then once with AAV5 shortly before the fusion. these results suggest that any shared epitopes between the two serotypes are probably weak. the 3C5 antibody was produced after only 3 days of immunization with AAV5. these antibodies may be less able to sterically hinder receptor binding compared with the 5H7 and 4E4 anti-AAV1 antibodies. AV1 4E4 IgG was able to significantly inhibit infection after capsids were already attached to cells. post-attachment neutralization may result from bivalent binding of the intact IgG to the capsid surface leading to cross-linking of adjacent capsid protein subunits. a greater proportion of anti-AAV1-specific IgGs was found following repeated administration of homologous capsid. three IgG- and four IgM-secreting hybridomas were isolated. cross-reactivity of the anti-AAV mAbs These reagents provide useful reagents for the study of AAV immunogenicity and cellular entry. the anti-AAV1 9A8 and anti-AAV5 3C5 were the least efficient neutralizing antibodies. the 3C5 antibody was produced after only 3 days of immunization with AAV5. this ability to neutralize at more than one step may contribute to its neutralization efficacy. 5H7 antibody retains the highest neutralizing ability as a Fab fragment. the antibody is not the most neutralizing as an intact IgG. this suggests that non-specific coating of the virion and cross-linking may be adequate to achieve neutralization in some cases. Fab fragments were composed of VP1, VP2 and VP3 expressed from baculoviruses under control of the polyhedron promoter. mice were immunized with 0.1 mg AAV1 capsids initially by the subcutaneous route. spleen lymphocytes were fused to mouse myeloma Sp2/0 cells. 293T cells were transfected with pAAV1RC or pAAV5cap and pAAV2rep78. capsids were harvested 48 h after transfection and purified using a caesium chloride step gradient. highest titre fractions identified by qPCR and TCID50 analysis in Cos-1 or HeLa cells. ELISA and native dot-blot Westerns of purified VLPs were performed. antibodies were added and incubated for 1 h at 22 \u00b0C. the results of three independent experiments are shown. post-attachment neutralization was examined by incubating the same concentration of virus as above with cells for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C. after an additional hour at 4 \u00b0C the cells were washed extensively, and warm growth medium was added. mice were immunized with 0.1 mg AAV1 capsids initially by the subcutaneous route. Freund\u2019s complete adjuvant in the first immunization and Freund\u2019s incomplete adjuvant for the later immunizations. spleen lymphocytes were fused to mouse myeloma Sp2/0 cells. AAV1 and AAV5 VLPs were fluorescently labelled with Alexa-488 dyes. the degree of labelling was determined to be 10\u201315 dye molecules per VLP. mAb-producing hybridomas were grown in 500 ml culture bags. s of AAV1, AAV2 and AAV4\u2013AAV9 were spotted onto nylon membranes. positive control samples were boiled for 10 min prior to dot blotting. rAAV1\u2013GFP and rAAV5\u2013GFP capsids were incubated with 10-fold dilutions of purified intact IgGs or Fab fragments. ted in solution with 10-fold dilutions of purified intact IgGs or Fab fragments. mixture was applied to Cos-1 or HeLa cells at a concentration of 25 000 particles per cell. cells were washed extensively with cold growth medium and assayed for viral binding compared with a control well. positive anti-AAV antibody secreting hybridomas were cloned three times. mAb-producing hybridomas were grown in 500 ml culture bags. mAb-producing hybridomas were grown in 500 ml culture bags. d with papain using a Fab preparation kit (Thermo Scientific) and the monomeric Fab were further purified by chromatography using a Sephadex G100 column (Sigma) both ELISA and native (non-denaturing) dot-blot Westerns of purified VLPs were performed. cells were washed and fresh growth medium was added. the percentage of transduced cells was measured by determining the number of cells expressing GFP at 48 h after inoculation."}
