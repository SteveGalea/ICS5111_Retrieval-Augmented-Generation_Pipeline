{"summary": "PCR for TGEV-S1 gene amplification was performed using the forward primer (P1) (5\u2032-GGGGAAGCTTATGAAAAAACTATTTGTG-3\u2032) and reverse primer (P2) carrying a HindIII (P1) and an EcoRI (P2) restriction enzyme site. the plasmid was previously constructed in our laboratory. the cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C for about 24 hr, fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, and incubated with anti-TGEV-S1 or anti-pIL-12 (p40) antibody. the green fluorescence signals were detected using a fluorescence microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) four mice per group were euthanized at 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42 days after first immunization. mononuclear cells were isolated from the blood and spleen of the euthanized animals. the levels of pVAX1-(pIL-12) (C), inactivated TGEV vaccine (D), PBS (E) and pVAX1 (F) were detected at 42 dpi with ELISA kits, a) P0.01 (highly significant) as compared with other groups. TGEV-specific antibody from the serum of vaccinated mice was detected with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) the absorbance was detected at 490 nm wavelength. mouse sera (1:10 doubling dilution) were diluted with a diluent. the standard solution of IFN- and IL-4 was diluted from 2,000 to 31.3 pg/ml and 500 to 7.8 pg/ml. the serum (1:100) from 42 days post-immunization was used to evaluate IFN- and IL-4 responses. l) were mixed with LDH assay reagent (100 l/well) for 15 min (37\u00b0C) in 96-well plates. the maximum release of LDH was that the total of target cells were dissolved in Triton X-100 (1% v/v) the spontaneous release was that the target cells exist single. pVAX1-(TGEV-S1), pVAX1-(pIL-12) and pVAX1-(pIL-12) were resuspended in 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at a concentration of 1 g/l, and 1 l of each plasmid was transfected into BHK-21 cells at about 90% confluence. six-week-old mice were immunized with 100 g of pVAX1-(TGEV-S1), pVAX1-(pIL-12), pVAX1-(TGEV-S1) plus pVAX1-(pIL-12) after 15 min, the mice were immunized with 50 l 0.8% lidocaine hydrochloride (27 gauge needles) in the medial vastus muscle. the six groups include pVAX1-(pIL-12) (A), pVAX1-(TGEV-S1) (B), pVAX1-(TGEV-S1) plus pVAX1-(pIL-12) (C), inactivated TGEV vaccine (D), PBS (E), and pVAX1 (F). immunoizing dose, vaccine category, and number of mice are indicated. cells were treated with methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT, 10 l/well) for 4 hr. the reaction was terminated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) viability of cells was calculated by reading the absorbance at 490 nm wavelength. in 24-well plates (37\u00b0C, 5% CO2), and the TGEV-specific cytopathic effects were observed at 48\u201360 hr post-infection. the inhibition rate (%) of TGEV focus-forming unit (FFU) were calculated as follows: [1(FFU in the test serum/FFU in negative control serum) 100] the concentrations of IFN- and IL-4 in the serum were determined according to the standard curve. the test was conducted according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. the effector cells were obtained from the blood and spleen lymphocytes of 42 dpi mice. the sequences of pVAX1-(TGEV-S1) and pVAX1-(pIL-12) were analyzed from GenBank. the results of nucleotide sequence comparison revealed 100 and 99.8% similarity with the strain accession numbers M94101 (PUR46-MAD) (S1) and NM_214013.1 (pIL-12), respectively. T lymphocytes from the peripheral blood (PBL) (A) and spleen (SPL) (B) of mice were analyzed with MTT assay. the y-coordinate represents the lymphocyte proliferate index (OD 490 nm) in the peripheral blood or spleen. the number of CD4+ and CD8+ cells in the peripheral blood was significantly higher (P0.01) in pVAX1-(TGEV-S1) and pVAX1-(pIL-12) groups. at 28 dpi, the pVAX1-(TGEV-S1) plus pVAX1-(pIL-12) group had significantly higher (P0.01) number of CD4+ and CD8+ cells than other groups. the production of neutralizing antibodies in the serum at 35 days post-immunization was evaluated with virus neutralizing assays. pVAX1-(TGEV-S1), pVAX1-(TGEV-S1) plus pVAX1-(pIL-12) and inactivated vaccine groups showed better antibody production than the control groups. pVAX1-(TGEV-S1) plus pVAX1-(pIL-12) group showed the highest activity of CTLs in the blood and spleen. the pVAX1-(TGEV-S1) plus pVAX1-(pIL-12) group showed the highest activity of CTLs both in the blood and spleen. pVAX1-(TGEV-S1) and pVAX1-(pIL-12)-expressing cells. transient expression of proteins was detected with anti-transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV)-S1 antibody. green signals indicate positive protein expression. pVAX1-(TGEV-S1) and pVAX1-(pIL-12) were collected and subjected to flow cytometry analysis to evaluate proportions of CD4+ and CD8+ cells in peripheral blood MCs (C) and SMCs (D) at 28 dpi, the pVAX1-(TGEV-S1) plus pVAX1-(pIL-12) group showed much higher upregulation (P0.01) in spleen T at 28 dpi, the pVAX1-(TGEV-S1) plus pVAX1-(pIL-12) group had significantly higher (P0.01) number of CD4+ and CD8+ cells than other groups. pVAX1-(TGEV-S1), pVAX1-(TGEV-S1) plus pVAX1-(pIL-12) and vaccine-treated groups had a higher proportion of antibodies than the control groups. pVAX1-(TGEV-S1), pVAX1-(TGEV-S1) plus pVAX1-(pIL-12) and inactivated vaccine groups showed better antibody production than the control groups. the serum inhibition rates of TGEV FFU were higher for pVAX1-(TGEV-S1) plus pVAX1-(pIL-12) and vaccine groups. the spleen and peripheral blood of the mice treated with pVAX1-(TGEV-S1) plus pVAX1-(pIL-12) were significantly different from activities in the spleen and peripheral blood of the mice from control groups. the pVAX1-(TGEV-S1) plus pVAX1-(pIL-12) group showed the highest activity of CTLs both in the blood and spleen. pVAX1-(TGEV-S1) and pVAX1-(pIL-12) immunized groups had similar effects on humoral immune response. pVAX1-(TGEV-S1) and pVAX1-(pIL-12) immunized groups had different IFN- and IL-4 responses. pVAX1-(TGEV-S1) and inactivated vaccine had similar effects on humoral immune response. VAX1-(pIL-12) exerted positive effects on the activation of CTLs in the blood and spleen. pIL-12 could act as an immunological adjuvant in the DNA vaccine for TGEV-S1."}
