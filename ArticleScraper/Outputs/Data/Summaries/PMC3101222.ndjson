{"summary": "Perkinsus marinus is a pathogenic alveolate causing \u201cdermo\u201d disease in oysters. other species of Perkinsus cause similar afflictions in a wide variety of other marine molluscs worldwide. this genus belongs to the crown group of eukaryotes known as Alveolata. the presence of SL trans-splicing in Perkinsus spp. [8], [13] allies with dinoflagellates remains unresolved. the genome of P. marinus (86 million base pairs; Project ID: 12736), is closer in overall size to apicomplexans. mt gene mRNA editing occurs only in dinoflagellates. the frequency of editing events decreases from high levels in the late-branching lineages to none in the ancient lineages such as Oxyrrhis and Noctiluca. it is unclear if Perkinsus spp. mt gene mRNAs undergo editing. kinsus full-length cDNAs were mapped to genome sequences to identify corresponding genes. perkinsus marinus is a unique lineage basal to the monophyletic clade of dinoflagellates. Perkinsus SL sequences were used to query P. marinus whole-genome shotgun reads to identify SL RNA genes. the genome sequences were collected for alignment with one another and with SL RNAs from dinoflagellates. oligonucleotides from this study show no reference. no reference. cDNA blot analyses of SL RNA from 106 cells of both Perkinsus species and four strains of dinoflagellates were used for RNA blots. cDNA clones containing the two types of SL RNAs were dot blotted to serve as positive controls. two rounds of touch-down PCR were carried using same conditions as above. first round of PCR was performed using PmaSL-LSF1 and GeneRacer3 primers. mt cox1 and cob sequences were PCR-amplified from both genomic and cDNA templates. application Ncob5a CAAATTATNACWGGWATWTTYTTRGC Universal cob PCR Ncob5c GGTTAYGTNTTACCTTTTKDGGWCARATG Universal cob PCR Ncob3a GCRTARWANGGNTGRAARTACCAYTCNGG Universal cob PCR Ncob3a.

AUUCUGG (L-type) or AUCUGG (S-type) found within the SL was the only recognizable candidate Sm-binding site.

'-' indicates missing sequence; potential quadruplet codons 'aggy' for glycine and 'ccccu' quintuplet codons for proline are marked in grey. a standard 'ggu' codon for glycine in P. chesapeaki cox1 is marked in red. correct translation of Perkinsus mt genes required the TGA codes for tryptophan in general. glycine was also encoded by the quintuplet codons UAGGC and UCGGU. the deduced COB aa sequences of the two Perkinsus spp. shared 97% similarity to each other, 34\u201336% to apicomplexans, 22\u201344% to dinoflagellates, 15\u201317% to ciliates, 27\u201333% to other organisms. perkinsus spp. clustered with dinoflagellates in COB tree. apicomplexans and ciliates formed a monophyletic group. heterokont diatoms formed a monophyletic group. MB produced trees of similar topologies in which P. marinus branched at the base of the dinoflagellate clade. only exception was the MB tree in which P. marinus was allied with the clade of apicomplexans. consensus tree inferred from the three algorithms showed the close relationship between P. marinus and dinoflagellates. the homolog retrieved from the P. marinus genome was clustered with H2A.X in the clade of apicomplexans based on histone H2A. the canonical H2A and the isoform H2A.X consensus tree with support from NJ. SL RNAs mark earlier emergence and more complex evolution of trans-splicing in alveolates PmaSLRNA sequences. the SL has left its footprints in other parts of the dinoflagellate genome in the form of single and tandem exon repeats. SL exons in single or multiple units were found in some P. marinus genes. the SL RNA transcripts in other SL trans-splicing eukaryotes range from 46 nt in the urochordate Ciona intestinalis to 142 nt in trypanosoma brucei. perkinsus spp. may represent the earliest trans-splicing lineage within Alveolata, separated from the non-trans-splicing Ciliophora and Apicomplexa [8], yet distinct from multi-protein phylogenies consistently show that P. marinus is related to dinoflagellates among other representative eukaryotes. in all trees, P. marinus was positioned as the earliest divergent even when Oxyrrhis, a genus hypothesized to be a pre-dinoflagellate [32] or an ancient lineage [12], was included. the current analysis is limited in that only the sequences from one or two species of Perkinsus were available. the current analysis is limited in that only the sequences from one or two species of Perkinsus were available. the current analysis is limited in that only the sequences from one or two species of Perkinsus were available. marinus cob and cox1 mRNAs are identical to their genomic DNAs. the mRNA was not translatable with standard codon usage due to a reading frame that had to be shifted 10 times at every AGG and CCC codon to yield a consensus COX1 protein. one or two sites of +1 frameshifting have been documented in animal mt genes. tRNA mutants suppress +1 frameshifts via an extended anticodon loop in Escherichia coli (e.g. [43]), and quadruplet codons are used in protein mutagenesis. a number of recent phylogenetic trees containing taxa from marine alveolate group I reinforce grouping of Perkinsus spp. as an independent phylum [7], [45], [46]. the form of single and tandem exon repeats is postulated to occur when SL-containing mRNA are reverse-transcribed and integrated to the genome. SL exons in single or multiple units were found in some P. marinus genes. the SL RNA transcripts in other SL trans-splicing eukaryotes range from 80\u201383 nt. the presence of SL RNA trans-splicing in Perkinsus spp. indicates its inclusion in or alliance with the phylum of dinoflagellates. the presence of SL RNA trans-splicing in perkinsus spp. indicates its inclusion in or alliance with the phylum of dinoflagellates. some degree of uncertainty exists in the phylogenetic position of Perkinsus. genes of all four major histones have recently been found in dinoflagellates. genes of all four major histones have recently been found in dinoflagellates. pcna, form II Rubisco, 14-3-3, and centrin for several dinoflagellates. a relatively high intron density for a dinoflagellate is found in amphidinium carterae. a survey of 31 genes yielded a 48% cis-splicing rate. in retroviruses, a \u20131 frameshift is corrected by tRNA back-slippage over homopolymeric codons adjacent to a local secondary structure that may include a pseudoknot. tRNAs in the Perkinsus mitochondrial system recognizing non-triplet codons AGGY and CCCCU to code for glycine and proline may be more likely than the ribosomal frameshifting scenario. phylogenetic trees containing taxa from marine alveolate group I reinforce grouping of Perkinsus spp. as an independent phylum [7], [45], [46]. future phylogenies with broader taxon sampling that include species from Parvilucifera spp., Syndiniales in addition to Amoebophrya, and marine alveolate group I representatives will refine the phylogenetic relationships. groupings of major clades are labeled on the right.
