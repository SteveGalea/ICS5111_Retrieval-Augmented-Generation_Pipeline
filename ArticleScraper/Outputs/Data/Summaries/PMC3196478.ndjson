{"summary": "Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV) was discovered in 1976 as the etiological agent of a severe human viral hemorrhagic fever known as Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever. it typically results in a rapidly fatal illness associated with high-level viremia, lack of an effective immune response, drastic lymphopenia, a severe coagulation disorder. eotaxin, eotaxin, M-CSF, MIP-1, MIP-1, MCP-1, IL-9, IL-13 were typical for fatal cases. mononuclear phagocytes are very early, if not initial, targets of ZEBOV infection. studies performed in vitro suggest macrophages play a major role in inducing cytokine dysregulation. protein VP40 and spike glycoprotein (GP1,2) [19] or with UV-inactivated ZEBOV [16] indicated that virus replication might not be required for the activation of macrophages. the aim of the current study was to determine the gene expression profiles of human macrophages exposed to infectious Ebola virions using DNA microarray technology. cells were cultivated in RPMI 1640 (invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing 20% heat-inactivated human AB serum (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 g/ml), and L-glutamine (2 mM) all cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO2 environment. supernatant from mock-infected Vero E6 cells was purified and quantified by the same procedures. plasmids encoding ZEBOV VP40 and/or ZEBOV GP1,2 were generated by transient transfection of HEK 293T cells with plasmids. RPMI 1640 contains 2% human AB serum, penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 g/ml), and L-glutamine (2 mM) cells were then incubated for one day at 37\u00b0C in a humidified, 5% CO2 environment. cells of donors D4, D5, and D6 were infected with either mock virus preparation or ZEBOV at a multiplicity of infection. the remaining data included 8,861 probe sets. additional data reduction was achieved by excluding all genes identified as \u2018no change\u2019 (NC) in all six experiments. networks of these genes were algorithmically generated based on their connectivity. the biological relationship between two nodes is represented as an edge (line) the intensity of the node color indicated the degree of up- or down-regulation. genes in uncolored notes were not identified as differentially expressed in our experiment. human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T epithelial cells and grivet (Chlorocebus aethiops) kidney epithelial Vero E6 cells were maintained in DMEM (invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing 20% heat-inactivated human AB serum (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 g/ml), and L-glut plasmids encoding HEK 293T cells were generated by transfection of HEK 293T cells with plasmids encoding ZEBOV VP40 and/or ZEBOV GP1,2. negative staining was performed on formvar carbon-coated copper grids. purified VLP solution was exposed to a freshly glow-discharged grid for 2 min. cell supernatants were removed from cells 1 h or 6 h post infection. RNA from 10 MOI was subjected to quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis. the remaining data included 8,861 probe sets. additional data reduction was achieved by excluding all genes identified as 'no change' networks of these genes were algorithmically generated based on connectivity. intensity of the node color indicated the degree of up- or down-regulation. qPCR was performed using strand-specific primers for reverse transcriptase reaction. genes detected as absent (p0.05) on all 12 arrays were removed from a total of 12,606 probe sets prior to ratio analysis. log2 ratio was plotted as a function of the average log2 intensity of Ebola virion-exposed versus mock-exposed samples to test for hybridization quality and for the extent of variation among biological replicates. trend selection criteria were established to screen for a common tendency or direction of changes in cellular gene expression levels. only changes with an associated p-value of 0.01 were considered. changes of less than 2-fold were accepted if the direction of change in macrophages from all donors was the same. clustering of these 205 genes revealed two subclusters. gene subcluster 1 was characterized by extensive expression variability across donors and time points. many genes in subcluster 2 show consistent responses among all three donors in at least one time point. expression levels of cellular genes identified by applying the trend analysis changed at the 1 h time point. expression levels of almost all identified genes were upregulated, with exception of genes encoding GNA13, CREM, and LILRB2 at the 1 h time point and MRPS6, and DUSP2 at the 6 h time point. genes identified above and fold-changes >1.5 and associated p-values>0.01 were chosen as parameters for pathway ORA. the resultsant differentially regulated pathways with p-values0.1 are presented in Tables 1 and 2.

GP1,2 is the only known surface-exposed structural component of Ebola virions. if virion binding is responsible for the observed macrophage responses, then these effects would be mediated by GP1,2. we therefore hypothesize that if virion binding is responsible for the observed macrophage responses then these effects would be mediated by GP1,2. a higher MOI of Ebola virions (100) was used for this experiment. cells were exposed to VLPs and latex particles at a concentration of 100 particles per cell. the results revealed that while a higher MOI did increase the overall intensity of responses compared to the first experiments, it did not eliminate or noticeably reduce the degree of variation of gene expression levels between donors. values indicate upregulation as compared to mock infection/treatments. white indicates no change in gene expression (log2 = 0) each gene has been tested with 5 different stimuli (ZEBOV, VLPVP40-GP, VLPs VLPVP40, LPS, and neutral latex beads) analysis revealed genes that were upregulated at the 1 h and then downregulated at the 6 h time point (GADD45, DUSP2, IL-10), genes that were first downregulated and then upregulated (IDO, ISG 45K), a large group of genes induced at both time points. the second clustering ordered the experimental groups according to similar responses in gene expression. lusters within the first two clusters were identified. one revealed that out of the 13 genes upregulated at both time points, 9 responded, albeit weakly, to VLPVP40 at the 1 h time point. this supports the notion that the matrix protein VP40 might also be involved in cellular interactions upon binding/entry, which may participate in triggering part of the detected responses in macrophages. of the genes that responded to only two of the presented stimuli, more genes reacted similarly to virions and LPS than to virions and VLP. the difference consists of the expression patterns of G-CSF, 4-1BB, TF, RSAD2 (at 6 h only) and DUSP2. genes detected as absent (p0.05) on all 12 arrays were removed from a total of 12,606 probe sets prior to ratio analysis. log2 ratio was plotted as a function of the average log2 intensity of Ebola virion-exposed versus mock-exposed samples to test for hybridization quality and for the extent of variation among biological replicates. fold-change, p-values, and signal strength were established. a minimum of a 2-fold-difference in cellular gene expression levels in infected macrophages from at least two of the three donors in at least one of the two time points. intensity of colors reflects intensity of changes in gene expression. clustering of these 205 genes revealed two subclusters. gene subcluster 1 was characterized by extensive expression variability across donors and time points. expression levels of cellular genes identified by applying the trend analysis changed at the 1 h time point. this set includes genes whose elevated expression was previously associated with human Ebola virus disease, such as those encoding CXCL1, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF- [6], [11], as well as genes previously unknown to play a role in Ebola virus disease. Integrated data was limited to the 2,025 genes identified above. fold-changes >1.5 and associated p-values>0.01 were chosen as parameters for pathway ORA.

DNA microarray results and real-time RT-PCR quantification of changes in cellular expression levels of 16 selected human macrophages genes. data are expressed as fold-change of cellular gene expression. data represent the median value for donors 1, 2, and 3. macrophage responses following exposure with infectious virions were directly compared to exposure to VLPs lacking viral genetic material. GP1,2 is the only known surface-exposed structural component of Ebola virions and contains the cell-surface receptor-binding domain. if virion binding is responsible for the observed macrophage responses, these effects would be mediated by GP1,2. a higher MOI of Ebola virions (100) was used for this experiment. cells were exposed to VLPs and latex particles at a concentration of 100 particles per cell. the results revealed that while a higher MOI did increase the overall intensity of responses compared to the first experiments, it did not eliminate or noticeably reduce the degree of variation of gene expression levels between donors. each gene has been tested with 5 different stimuli (ZEBOV, VLPVP40-GP, VLPs VLPVP40, LPS, and neutral latex beads) each gene has been tested with 5 different stimuli (ZEBOV, VLPVP40-GP, VLPs VLPVP40, LPS, and neutral latex beads) each gene has been tested with 5 different stimuli (ZEBOV, VLPVP40-GP, VLPs VLPVP40, LPS, and neutral first cluster was then used for clustering in a second dimension to group experimental stimuli according to similar effects they had on changes in gene expression. analysis revealed genes that were upregulated at the 1 h and then downregulated at the 6 h time point (GADD45, DUSP2, IL-10), genes that were first downregulated and then upregulated (IDO, ISG 45K), a large group of genes induced at both time points. the second clustering ordered the experimental groups according to similar responses in subclusters were identified within the first two clusters. one revealed that out of the 13 genes upregulated at both time points, 9 responded, albeit weakly, to VLPVP40 at the 1 h time point. this supports the notion that the matrix protein VP40 might also be involved in cellular interactions upon binding/entry. more genes react similarly to virions and LPS than to virions and VLP. difference consists of expression patterns of G-CSF, 4-1BB, TF, RSAD2 and DUSP2. changes on gene expression of IL-10, GNA13 and TLR3 are not significantly changed at these early time points even at 100 MOI infection. genes whose expression is known to be upregulated during acute Ebola hemorrhagic fever are already induced in primary target cells within the first hours of virion binding and entry. pathway ORA of the significantly differentially regulated genes identified from our gene expression studies demonstrated a strong upregulation of specific host signaling pathways during the immediate response to Ebola infection. IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, RANTES, and TNF- expression peaked at 1 h or 6 h before receding to base levels [19]. this results contradict observations in vivo, which demonstrated upregulation of cytokines for extended periods of time. VP40-GP, as well as to LPS, raises the question whether LPS and Ebola virions share receptors on the macrophage surface. the innate immune defense is achieved by activating NF-B and type I IFN responses. the host response to virulent pathogens is likely to fall into two categories [21] it is important to remember that this study partially characterizes the response of humans to ZEBOV infection and that humans are not natural hosts of this virus. it is therefore tempting to repeat our studies with cells from these animals to see whether their responses to Ebola virion are fundamentally different. 88 genes were identified from both threshold and trend analysis. many of these genes express proteins involved in apoptosis, inflammatory and acute immune responses, blood coagulation, and tissue remodeling."}
