{"summary": "a deltacoronavirus (porcine coronavirus HKU15-OH1987) was detected in fecal and small intestine samples from a pig farm in Ohio. the whole genome sequence of another PorCoV HKU15 strain, IN2847, has been detected in Indiana. the complete genome sequence of PorCoV HKU15-IN2847 has a nucleotide identity of 99.2% with HKU15-155 (GenBank accession no. JQ065043), 98.9% with HKU15-44 (GenBank accession no. JQ065042) and a 1-nt insertion (at position 25,263) in comparison with HKU15-44. strain IN2847 is similar in genetic profile to another strain of PorCoV HKU15, OH1987, detected in Ohio. the sequence data suggest that both U.S. strains of PorCoV HKU15 were introduced into the united states by a common source."}
