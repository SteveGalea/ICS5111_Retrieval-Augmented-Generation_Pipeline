{"summary": "osteosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is caused by obstruction or interruption of local blood supply, resulting in tissue ischemia, necrosis, and finally bone collapse. long-term and large-dose use of steroids have become the most important risk factors for non-traumatic ONFH. genetic polymorphisms have been found to be related to SONFH due to individual differences. this study will explicitly exclude studies in which the control group includes a healthy population or other types of ONFH. only comparison studies between ONFH and non-ONFH in the steroid use population are included. study compares patients with SONFH to healthy populations or populations with other types of ONFH; study is about family heredity; study is not SNP-related; and study does not report data pertaining to allelic frequencies. association analysis was performed using five genetic models. the effect size was estimated by calculating the summary odds ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence intervals (CIs) the following studies were included in our meta-analysis if they fulfilled the inclusion criteria: (1), study has a case-control or cohort study design; (2), steroid-using patients are included; (3), study compares ONFH and non-ONFH patients after steroid use; (3), study is about family heredity; (3), study is not SNP-related; and(4), study does not report data pertaining to allelic frequencies or calculable effect size. association analysis was performed using five genetic models. the effect size was estimated by calculating the summary odds ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence intervals (CIs) the study did not include steroid-related ONFH (2); the study was a case report (2); the report was a duplicate (2); and the research was of heredity SONFH (1). we collected 30 trials assessing 7,553 patients for our meta-analysis. prednisolone Hematologic; dermatologic; renal; ophthalmopathy; respiratory disease, etc. PAI-1 7 Wang et al., 2013 China 200 (94/106) 44.5 (18\u201382) Prednisolone Hematologic; dermatologic; dermatologic; renal; ophthalmopathy; respiratory disease, etc. china 157 (34/123) 35 (9\u201364) Methylprednisolone; prednisolone RT GR; CYP3A4; CBP; NCoA2 9 Yang and Xu, 2007 China 127 (21/106) 34 (11\u201367) Methylprednisolone; prednisone SLE ApoA 7 Hirata et al., 2007b Japan 158 (34/124) 36.1 (9\u201364 prednisolone RT PAI-1 8 ALL, Acute lymphoblastic leukemia; AS, Ankylosing spondylitis; ENT, Ear, nose, and throat; GWAS, Genome-wide association study; LT, Liver transplant; NOS, Newcastle-Ottawa Scale; NS, Nephrotic syndrome; RT, Renal transplant; SLE, Systemic lupus erythematosus. six SNPs in four genes were included in the meta-analysis. in the ABCB1 gene, rs1045642 is also known as C3435T, is located in the coding region, and is a synonymous mutation. only the dominant model was analyzed, and the results showed that there was a significant relationship between this mutation and SONFH (I2 = 50.3%; OR: 2.90; 95% CI: 1.49\u20135.66; p = 0.001). subgroup analysis results also indicated a significant relationship (I2 = 0%; OR: 4.81; 95% CI: 2.05\u201311.31;p 0.001) 0.017 0.806 0.664 Heterozygous model 5 790 0.83 0.60 1.15 0.263 0.00% 0.803 0.806 0.427 Case: 0.3666 Homozygous model 5 790 0.64 0.18 2.27 0.493 79.00% 0.003 1 0.934 Control: 0.106 Dominant model 5 790 0.78 0.57 1.06 0.111 11.90% 0.338 0.462 0.518 Total:0.0473 Recess 0.072 58.00% 0.068 1 0.67 Heterozygous model 4 570 2.46 1.27 4.77 0.008 54.50% 0.111 1 0.461 Case:0.0027 Homozygous model 4 570 7.70 1.23 48.16 0.029 24.40% 0.25 1 NA Control:0.2173 Dominant model 5 725 2.99 1.71 5.21 0.001 31.40% 0.212 0.624 0.82 Total:0.0003 Recessive model 4 the allelic model of ABCB1 rs1045642 showed a protective effect against SONFH. in these results, 1,141 patients were included; the average NOS score was 7.88. dominant model of ApoB rs693 showed that the mutation increases SONFH risk without heterogeneity. the SE of the result was less than 0.2, and the OR was greater than 2. Thus, the evidence levels were also moderate. the evidence levels for ApoB rs693 and rs1042031 were moderate. in a previous meta-analysis, Gong et al analyzed 23 studies and 35 genes. there was no relationship between PAI-1 rs1799768 and ABCB1 rs1045642. mutation does not cause changes in the amino acid sequence. this mutation is related to the metabolism of some drugs and to the prognosis of some cancers. mutation is more suitable for clinical use as a predictor of SONFH risk. rs693 is related to the circulating concentration of LDL cholesterol. rs1042031 is a coding sequence variant that causes glutamate to lysine mutation (C > T) the mutation is important for regulating the binding of apolipoprotein B to the LDL cholesterol receptor (Liu et al., 2013). the population was concentrated in Guangxi and Shandong in china. the centralization may be the main reason for the reduction in heterogeneity. atypical cadherin 1 NA NA NA NA NA NA CABIN1 Calcineurin-binding protein 1 NA Phosphatase regulator activity Inclusion body NA AMPD1 Adenosine monophosphate deaminase 1 Cellular metabolic compound salvage Deaminase activity; Myosin binding NA NA KCNMA1 Potassium calcium-activated channel subfamily M alpha 1 Renal system process;Excretion Metal ion transmembran our study only analyzed the SNPs that were examined in more than three studies. but with new research and evidence, more SNPs may be studied. this study was limited by the research available at the time."}
