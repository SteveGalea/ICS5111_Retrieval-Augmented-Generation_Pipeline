{"summary": "liver cancer is the sixth most common malignant tumor and the third largest cause of cancer mortality in the world. hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common histological type of liver cancer. studies have reported that cholesterol intake is an independent risk factor for HCC. 25-HC promotes HCC cells migration and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. the probable mechanism might be the up-regulating of TLR4-depedent FABP4. xenograft tumors were generated via the subcutaneous injection of HepG2 cells (2 106) into the right flanks of the mice. mice were intraperitoneally injected with 25-HC (10 mg/kg) every 3 days for 20 days. mice were sacrificed and the tumors were harvested, weighed and proteins were extracted for Western blotting. for FABP4 inhibition, BMS-309403 (45 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected twice a week after cells inoculation. cells or tumor tissues were washed with PBS twice before lysed with RIPA buffer (Beyotime) cell migration assay was assayed with a 24-well 8-m Transwell chambers (Corning Costar, Corning, NY, USA) non-invading cells remaining on the upper surface were removed and cells on the lower surface were fixed with ice-cold methanol and stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 30 min at room temperature. expression level of each target gene was normalized to a housekeeping gene encoding -actin. pNF-B-luc, pAP-1-luc and pSTAT3-TA-luc reporter plasmids were bought from beyotime. cells were transfected with the luciferase reporter plasmid with Lipofectamine 2000. after transfection, cells were treated with 25-HC for the indicated concentrations. 24 hours later, cells were collected and the luciferase activities were determined with the Bright-Glo luciferase assay system. UALCAN database was used to analyze expression of FABP4 in tumor sub-groups. correlation between expression of FABP4 and prognosis of patients with HCC was assessed in OncoLnc (http://www.oncolnc.org) animal studies 5-6-week-old female BALB/C nude mice were bought from Shanghai Laboratory Animal Company. mice were provided with water and food ad libitum and kept under standard conditions. mice were randomly divided into PBS group and 25-HC group. 5 106 HepG2 cells suspended in 50 L PBS were injected into right lobes of the liver with a syringe. the injection site was gently pressed with cotton to reduce bleeding and leakage of cell suspensions. mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, livers were removed, tumor nodules in the liver and abdominal cavity were observed. p85/p55 (#4228), PI3K p85 (#4292), p-Akt (#4060), Akt (#9145), Stat3 (#4904), p-NF-B p65 (#8242), -Actin (#8457), all bought from Cell Signaling Technologies, Danvers, MA, USA. incubation for 1 hour at room temperature with the HRP-linked goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody. RNA was extracted with the Ultrapure RNA kit (Cwbiotech, Beijing, China) reverse transcriptase PCR was performed with the HiFiScript cDNA Synthesis kit (Cwbiotech) expression level of each target gene was normalized to a housekeeping gene encoding -actin. pNF-B-luc, pAP-1-luc and pSTAT3-TA-luc plasmids were bought from Beyotime. cells were transfected with the luciferase reporter plasmid with Lipofectamine 2000. after transfection for 24 hours, cells were prepared for further experiments. UGATT NC UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUUCGGAGAATT Database analysis The mRNA expression of FABP4 in HCC was analyzed from the GEPIA (Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis) database. the DNA copy number of FABP4 in HCC was analyzed within the Oncomine database (www.oncomine.org). we also assessed the tumor growth in vivo by inoculating HepG2 cells into nude mice subcutaneously. we also detected the protein expressions of Bax, Bcl-2, MMP2, MMP3, MMP9 and MMP13 in xenograft tumor tissues. 25-HC treatment significantly increased the MMPs expressions compared with that of PBS group. proteins of xenograft tumors of two groups were extracted and expressions of MMP2, MMP3, MMP9, MMP13, Bcl-2 and Bax were determined by Western blotting. results were obtained from 3 independent experiments (A and B) or 2 independent experiments (C and D) results were obtained from 3 independent experiments. ns, not significant, *P0.05, **P0.01, ***P0.001. to further clarify role of 25-HC in HCC metastasis, the mice were sacrificed. 25-HC up-regulated all the phosphorylation level of the detected proteins in a dose- and time-dependent manner. then, the activities of NF-B, activator protein-1 (AP-1) and Stat3 were further determined by luciferase reporter assay. this data indicated that 25-HC promotes the activation of multiple signaling pathways. the migration of HepG2 cells induced by 25-HC is partly mediated by TLR4. the migration of HepG2 cells induced by 25-HC is partly mediated by TLR4. LR7 and TLR9 were examined by RT-qPCR. cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of 25-HC for 24 hours. expressions of MMP1, MMP2, MMP3 and MMP9 were determined by Western blotting. HepG2 cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of 25-HC for 24 hours before mRNA or protein was extracted. mRNA expressions of MMP1, MMP2, MMP3, MMP9 were detected by Western blotting. increased FABP4 expression by 25-HC was partly dependent on TLR4 to facilitate HepG2 cells migration. migratory ability of HepG2 cells was determined by Transwell assay. inhibition of FABP4 by BMS-309403 significantly decreased 25-HC-induced tumor metastasis (P0.05) however, there were no big differences in the body weight. transcription level of FABP4 was significantly higher in HCC patients than healthy people in subgroup analyses based on gender, age, weight, race, disease stages and tumor grade. correlation between expression of FABP4 and prognosis was assessed in OncoLnc. 25-HC has no effects on HepG2 cells proliferation and apoptosis. the proliferation of HepG2 cells was not affected by 25-HC treatment. the proliferation of HepG2 cells was not affected by 25-HC treatment. the percentage of FITC positive cells indicating apoptotic HepG2 cells were calculated and statistically analyzed. nude mice were inoculated subcutaneously with HepG2 cells (2 106) followed by PBS or 25-HC treatment intraperitoneally. 25-HC promotes the migratory ability of HCC cells by regulating MMPs in vitro. numbers of cells migrated through the membrane were calculated in five fields per well. BALB/C nude mice were intrahepatic inoculation of 5 106 HepG2 cells. at the end of the experiment, mice were sacrificed, livers were removed and imaged. the survival of mice for the whole experiment was recorded. p-Erk1/2, Erk1/2, p-p38, p38, p-SAPK/JNK, SAPK/JNK, p-Akt, Akt, p-PI3K p85/p55, PI3K p85, p-Stat3, Stat3, p-NF-B p65, NF-B p65 expressions by Western blotting. knockdown of TLR4 in HepG2 cells significantly inhibited the induced MMPs expressions and cells migration. knockdown of TLR9 had no obvious effects, implying that the promotion of cells migration induced by 25-HC is partly mediated by the up-regulation of TLR4. 25-HC significantly up-regulated FABP4 expression in a dose-dependent manner. expressions of FABP4 were validated by RT-qPCR and Western blotting. mRNA expressions of MMP1, MMP2, MMP3 and MMP9 were detected. BP4 knockdown of FABP4 has no effects on HepG2 cells proliferation. after 25-HC treatment, knockdown of FABP4 significantly decreased the number of cells migrated. mRNA and protein expression of FABP4 was assessed by RT-qPCR and Western blotting. results were obtained from 3 independent experiments and are expressed as the means SEM. the expression level of FABP4 was higher in liver hepatocellular carcinoma than in normal liver samples (Figure 9A). the results indicated that the expression level of FABP4 was higher in liver hepatocellular carcinoma than in normal liver samples (Figure 9A). mRNA expression of FABP4 in hepatocellular carcinoma and normal tissues (GEPIA) expression of FABP4 in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines (EMBL-EBI) expression of FABP4 in subgroups of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (OncoLnc) circulating levels of FABP4 increased in patients and in liver tissues of a chemically induced HCC mouse model suffered from a high fat diet. however, one study reported that FABP4 is down-regulated in HCC tissues and suppresses cells proliferation and invasion. this contradictory result requires further research and more clinical samples. information ajcr0009-2140-f10.pdf (280KB, pdf)."}
