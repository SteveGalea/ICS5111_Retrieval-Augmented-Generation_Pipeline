{"summary": "pestiviruses are single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses with genome length of 12.3 kb. the viral RNA genome contains one large open reading frame (ORF) encoding a polyprotein of 4,000 amino acids. cis-cleavage events are essential to generate structurally independent proteases that may carry out trans-cleavages more efficiently. ssRBG, putative single-stranded RNA binding groove. comparison of three global conformations of full-length NS3. conformation represents a \u201cclosed\u201d status with the C terminus buried intramolecularly. the 680-residue pestivirus NS3 is a multifunctional enzyme and a natural fusion of an N-terminal chymotrypsin-like serine protease and a C-terminal nucleotide triphosphatase. the protease is responsible for the cleavage of all the linkages in the NS3-NS4A-NS4B region of the viral polyprotein (20, 21) two minor autocleavage sites were identified within the NS3 protease module. altering either of the cleavage sites by Leu deletion or mutation greatly inhibited RNA replication in a CSFV replicon system. the two-thirds of Flaviviridae NS3 is a superfamily 2 (SF2) DExH/D-box RNA helicase (26) with 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 translocation directionality. the consensus conformation observed in the HCV full-length NS3 structure defines a protease-helicase interface mostly involving helicase D3 (29, 39, 40), providing information valuable to the understanding of NS3-NS4A cis-cleavage. the conformational diversity observed in available Flaviviridae NS3 structures suggests that each genus may have evolved distinct autoregulation mechanisms. single crystals of NS3/NS4APCS were obtained both in the initial screening and subsequent reproduction and optimization trials. the final model has Rwork/Rfree values of 0.196/0.250 and a resolution of 2.35. the structure is relatively complete, with 660 out of 683 residues in NS3 and 31 out of 37 residues in NS4APCS present. the full-length NS3 structure could be divided into a single-domain protease module and a helicase module comprising three globular domains\u2014D1, D2, and D3\u2014that are similar in size. the global arrangement of the helicase domains is consistent with the recently reported helicase-alone structures of CSFV and other helicase-containing Flaviviridae structures. in SF2 helicases, relative and repetitive motions between the NTPase domains (D1 and D2 in NS3) in accordance with other domains (D3 in NS3) are believed to couple with processive translocation on nucleic acids (8, 26) the Flaviviridae NS3 contains a unique extended anti-parallel -type structural element (residues 473 to 492 in CSFV NS3, termed \u201cD our CSFV NS3 structure and the HCV NS3 structure represent a postcleavage state in the NS3-NS4A cis-cleavage event. the C-terminal residues L683 and T631 occupy the protease active site, respectively. the cis-cleavage-related conformation is not a consequence of any protease cleavage event. atoms (95% coverage for both the protease and helicase) of 0.7 and 1.1 respectively. the construction mode of the flavivirus NS3 protease module and its NS4A PCS better resembles that observed in the flavivirus NS3/NS2BPCS structures (18, 44) stereo-pair images of the CSFV, HCV, and WNV NS3 protease structures are shown in blue. the side chains of the catalytic triad and the peptide-like inhibitor in the WNV active site are shown as sticks. cis-cleavage occurs at the NS3-NS4A junction by pesti- and hepacivirus NS3. all flaviviridae helicase D1s and D3s are anchored by extensive interactions, not allowing large-scale domain motions relative to each other. flavivirus NS3 cis-cleavage in flaviviruses may be difficult to achieve. cis-cleavage in flaviviruses was evident only at the NS2B-NS3 junction instead. full-length CSFV NS3 structure also provides structural details for protease substrate specificity. pestivirus NS3 protease activity was sensitive to a deletion at the N-terminal region of NS4APCS (10) the hepacivirus NS3 N terminus forms a shorter anti-parallel structure with its PCSN. the flavivirus NS3 protease does not have any structural equivalent in available crystal structures. the intramolecular interface formed between NS3 protease and helicase occludes a solvent-accessible surface area of 2,243 2 in total. both the N- and C-barrels participate in the interface, while on the helicase side, D3 and D2-D3 linker are the primary contributors. the interface includes a mixture of charged, hydrophilic, and hydrophobic interactions that can be defined into three clusters. three clusters of interactions comprise the protease-helicase interface. top panels show the distribution of interactions, with the left panel viewing from the helicase to the protease (surface representation) and the right panel viewing from the protease (surface representation) to the helicase (surface representation) protease-helicase interactions inhibited in vitro helicase activities but not ATPase activities. we designed three sets of mutants according to the three clusters of interface interactions observed in our NS3/NS4APCS structure. the mutation was introduced into NS3/NS4APCS; this construct is referred as the wild-type (WT NS3 in the enzymatic characterization described below. 93A NA Disrupt a hydrogen bond HB_2 N93D NA Interfere with the hydrogen bonding network HB_3 S525A NA Shorten the side chain but preserve the charge a The WT enzyme contains the NS4APCS (residues 21 to 57) and the full-length NS3 as the N- and C-terminal regions, respectively. pestivirus NS3 exhibited a very low level of unwinding activity. the NS3 \u201cWalker A\u201d K232A mutant was used as a negative control (NC) (17) NS3/NS4APCS has three clusters of interface interactions. the second cluster involving the triple salt bridges and the Y555:(G139/G140) hydrophobic interactions have relatively lower impact on helicase activity. we further assessed the ATPase activity of CSFV NS3 and its variants. the mean unwound percentages are shown underneath the gels. lanes 1 to 9 and lanes 10 to 15 were run on two different gels. ATP hydrolysis was indirectly measured through the detection of phosphate production. the 10 interface mutations were each introduced into an infectious cDNA clone pSM (derived from the CSFV Shimen strain) each cDNA construct was transcribed in vitro from each cDNA construct and then used to transfect PK-15 cells. recovery of infectious virus in transfected cells was detected by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) with an anti-NS3 antibody (17) at 72 h posttransfection. PK-15 cells transfected with construct transcripts according to the vWT NS3, set 2 \u201cCAP\u201d mutants vCAP_1/2 (Y555F and Y555A), set 3 mutants vHB_1/2/3/4 (N93A, N93D, S525A, and E561D Titers are shown as the averages from three independent experiments, with SDs. average plaque diameters (calculated based on 18 to 34 plaques) are shown, with SDs. in NS3 and 31 out of 37 residues in NS4APCS present in the final model. the majority of the unresolved residues are within the linker regions either between the protease and helicase or between helicase domains D1 and D2. the full-length NS3 structure could be divided into a single-domain protease module and a helicase module. the protease module consisting of NS3 residues 1 to 197 and NS4A residues 23 to 53 contains a typical dual -barrel core. the global arrangement of the helicase domains is consistent with the recently reported helicase-alone structures of CSFV and other helicase-containing Flaviviridae structures the bridge likely serves as a steric module at the ssRNA and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) junction (ss-ds junction) it turned out that NS3 adopted a relatively compact or \u201cclosed\u201d conformation with the protease approaching the \u201cback\u201d of the helicase, forming intramolecular interactions mainly with helicase D3. NS3 construct having a C-terminal fusion of NS4A residues 1 to 8. the NS4A residue occupying the protease S1 pocket mimicking a post-trans-cleavage situation. differences at the C termini of the NS3 constructs likely play roles critical to the different global conformation and different cleavage modes captured by crystallography. both PCSN and PCSC are required for pestivirus protease function (15) the PCSC of flavivirus can reach the substrate binding cleft, but the PCSC of CSFV may make only structural contributions to the C-barrel. HCV requires only a 12-residue NS4A segment (CSFV PCSN equivalent) for protease function. the C termini (cyan) of CSFV/HCV NS3 and the peptide-like inhibitor (gray) in the WNV structure are shown as sticks. key side chains in the P1 residue binding pocket (i.e., the S1 pocket) are shown as sticks. flavivirus NS3 cis-cleavage in flaviviruses was evident only at the NS2B-NS3 junction instead. conformation captured related to the cis-cleavage mode provides information for protease substrate specificity. pestivirus and hepacivirus NS3 prefer leucine and threonine/cysteine. flavivirus NS3 P1 site is relatively flat and spacious. comparison provides structural basis for substrate specificity at the S1 pocket. pestivirus and hepacivirus NS3 preferring leucine and threonine/cysteine. in flavivirus NS3, the path of PCSC is quite different. a -type region corresponding to 10 of CSFV NS3 plays a primary role in interacting with the PCSC. the intramolecular interface between protease and helicase in CSFV NS3 featured by three clusters of interactions. the second cluster includes a triple salt bridge charge network and a \u201chydrophobic cap\u201d at its edge. the salt bridges of E141:K183 in the protease C-barrel and R551:E571 in the helicase D3 are in close proximity, allowing an additional salt bridge formed between E141 and R551. top panels show the distribution of interactions, with the left panel viewing from the helicase to the protease (surface representation) and the right panel viewing from the protease (only key side chains are shown) to the helicase (surface representation) bottom panels show clusters 1, 2, and 3. (B and C) Stereo-pair images of the protease-helicase interface viewing from two different angles with 3,500-K composite SA omit electron density map. the mutation was introduced to abolish the autocleavage activity of the protease in all protein constructs listed here. the mutation was introduced to abolish the autocleavage activity of the protease in all protein constructs listed here. the percentage of the unwound release strand to the total amount of release strand (R20) was calculated based on the fluorescent signals detected from native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) resolving free R20 from T40:R20 complex. an NS3 construct containing only the helicase module (NS3Hel) unwound only 20% of the substrate (Fig. 4A, lanes 4 and 5 and Table 3) two out of four mutants in the third set (HB_2, N93D, and HB_4, E561D) showed apparent effects. perturbations into the protease-helicase interface, in general, downregulate helicase activity in vitro. helicase unwinding activity was measured using a T40:R20 pssRNA construct. Lane 1, annealed T40:R20 in the absence of helicase (the upper band represents the annealed form); lane 2, heat-denatured T40:R20 (the lower band represents the released R20) negative control (NC), helicase-only, and WT constructs were compared to three sets of mutants (lanes 6 to 15) NS3Hel 20.0 3.3 36.7 3.6 4.3 0.1 NTe NT NCf 4.1 1.3 NDg ND NT TAIL_2 51.1 2.0 35.4 3.0 4.7 0.1 ND NT TAIL_2 41.2 3.7 114.2 6.4 4.0 0.1 ND NT CEX_1 83.4 4.4 36.0 3.1 5.0 0.1 ND NT CEX_2 63.6 4.1 28.3 3.3 4.8 0.2 ND d The WT helicase unwinding data were based on 10 measurements. e NT, not tested, g ND, not detected. perturbation into the protease-helicase interface inhibited CSFV replication. vHB_1/2 and vCAP_1/2 mutations significantly impaired infectious virus production. compared with vWT CSFV, only the vHB_3 mutant virus showed a similar plaque diameter. vTAIL deletion and vCEX mutant constructs showed a similar plaque diameter. this autoinhibitory effect forms the basis for Mfd to turn on its translocase activity only upon interaction with an RNA polymerase trapped by DNA damage. in the HCV NS3 crystal structure in complex with a single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), the 5\u2032 end of the ssRNA \u201chits\u201d the D2-D3 bridge. the electrostatic potential analysis indicates that these surface patches form a continuous and extended positive-potential groove. this observation is reminiscent of that of the coronavirus nsp10-nsp16 complex in which nsp10 may stimulate the RNA capping process by extending the positively charged RNA binding groove in nsp16 methyltransferase. se domains 1A and 1B coordinate for ATP hydrolysis-driven conformational changes leading to an inchworming motion along the single-stranded region of the nucleic acids. however, the SF2 pestivirus NS3 is quite different from the SF1 helicases. the construction mode of PcrA:pssDNA cannot be readily applied to the unresolved NS3:pssRNA complex. kT/e to 3 kT/e, where k is Boltzman constant, T is temperature in Kelvin, and e is the charge of an electron. cleavage at the corresponding NS3 terminus may be essential for the life cycle of the Flaviviridae viruses. biochemical evidence of cis-cleavages at hepaci- and pestivirus NS3-NS4A and flavivirus NS2B-NS3 has been reported for various virus systems (10, 15, 47, 59) the capture of the post-cis-cleavage state has provided valid evidence to further support the existence of cis-cleavage at the NS3-NS4A junction for the Hepacivirus and Pestivirus genera. internal cleavages within NS3 have been reported for various Flaviviridae (10, 47, 62) the cleavage sites were mapped to Leu159/Lys160 and Leu192/Met193 of CSFV NS3, both within the protease module. mutations at either residue 159 or 192 sites greatly affect virus production. the removal of the majority of the protease module may be detrimental to the helicase function. the low cleavage efficiency at these internal sites may reflect a balance of requirements in polyprotein processing and RNA genome replication. by solving the closed-conformation crystal structure of the full-length CSFV NS3 in complex with its NS4APCS. our structural and functional data suggest that the helicase function of CSFV NS3 is rather stimulated through the intramolecular interactions between the protease and helicase in the closed-conformation state. in the HCV NS3 crystal structure in complex with a single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), the 5\u2032 end of the ssRNA \u201chits\u201d the D2-D3 bridge (39). nsp10 may stimulate the RNA capping process by extending the positively charged RNA binding groove in nsp16 methyltransferase (56) nsp10-nsp16 complex may stimulate the RNA capping process by extending the positively charged RNA binding groove in nsp16 methyltransferase (56) SF1 helicases with respect to the relative placement of accessory domains (D3 and protease in NS3; D1B and D2B in PcrA) relative to the ATPase domains (D1 and D2 in NS3; D1A and D2A in PcrA) therefore, the construction mode of PcrA:pssDNA cannot be readily applied to the unresolved NS3:pssRNA complex the two proteins were manually oriented based on the structural conservation of the -sheet in NS3 D1 and PcrA D1A. cleavages at the viral protease terminus may be essential for the life cycle of the Flaviviridae viruses. cis-cleavage at the NS3-NS4A junction is likely achieved by NS2 protease. for flaviviruses, the NS2-NS3 junction is achieved through NS3 trans-cleavage. this trans-cleavage-defective state is optimal for helicase function. the open conformation is capable of protease trans-cleavage. but the helicase RNA unwinding activity is impaired without the intramolecular protease-helicase interactions observed in the closed conformation. internal cleavages within NS3 have been reported for various Flaviviridae (10, 47, 62) the full-length NS3 (NS3) and its NS4A protease cofactor segment (NS4APCS; residues 21 to 57) were amplified from the CSFV infectious clone pSM (52, 53) and cloned into the pET28a vector. an NS3 S163A mutation was introduced to generate pET28a-NS3S163A/NS4APCS using the QuikChange muta all 10 protease-helicase interface mutants and the helicase \u201cWalker A\u201d mutant were constructed using pET28a_NS4APCS-NS3S163A as the template and the QuikChange mutagenesis method. expression of NS3S163A/NS4APCS and its variants and NS3Hel was performed. the lysate was clarified by centrifugation for 60 min at 17,000 rpm in a fiberlite F21-8x50y rotor (Thermo Scientific) the target protein was eluted with elution buffer (300 mM imidazole, 50 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 150 mM Na2SO4, 20% [vol/vol] glycerol, and 0.02% [wt/vol] NaN3 molar extinction coefficient of each purified protein was calculated with the exPASy ProtParam tool. the typical yield is 4 to 5 mg of pure protein per liter of bacterial culture. crystals were obtained by sitting-drop vapor diffusion at 16\u00b0C using 10 mg/ml of protein. the 3,500-K composite simulated-annealing omit 2Fo-Fc electron density maps were generated using crystallography and NMR System (CNS) the omit map corresponding to each box was then calculated by excluding the model in that box. rhodamine N-succinimidyl ester (6-TAMRASE) was designed to form an 18-bp duplex in an annealing buffer (25 mM HEPES [pH 7.5], 500 mM NaCl) at a 2.5:1 molar ratio. the mixture was incubated at 95\u00b0C for 5 min and was then slowly cooled down to 25\u00b0C. RNAs in the quenched reaction mixtures were resolved by 12% nondenaturing gel electrophoresis. the fluorescent signal of 6-TAMRASE-labeled R20 was detected with a Typhoon 9200 imager (GE Healthcare) with an excitation wavelength of 532 nm and a 580-nm emission filter. unless otherwise indicated, each unwinding reaction was performed five times. initial ATPase catalytic rates were determined based on the slope of the initial absorbance change and the reference standard curve of absorbance versus phosphate concentration determined independently. the observed ATP hydrolysis rates at various ATP concentrations were fitted to Michaelis-Menten kinetics to yield the ATPase parameters. PK-15 cell monolayers in 24-well plates were infected with 200 to 400 TCID50s of viruses. the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 96 h. the cells were fixed with 50% (vol/vol) methanol-acetone. residues 204 to 683) were made using pSM as the template and pET28a as the vector. all 10 protease-helicase interface mutants and the helicase \u201cWalker A\u201d mutant were constructed using pET28a_NS4APCS-NS3S163A as the template. all mutations were confirmed by sequencing data. the lysate was clarified by centrifugation for 60 min at 17,000 rpm in a fiberlite F21-8x50y rotor (Thermo Scientific) the target protein was eluted with elution buffer (300 mM imidazole, 50 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 150 mM Na2SO4, 20% [vol/vol] glycerol, and 0.02% [wt/vol] NaN3 crystals of NS3S163A/NS4APCS were obtained by sitting-drop vapor diffusion at 16\u00b0C using 10 mg/ml of protein. a volume of 0.4 to 1 l of protein was mixed with an equal volume of dl-malic acid (pH 7.0) in the crystallization drop. the 3,500-K composite simulated-annealing omit 2Fo-Fc electron density maps were generated using crystallography and NMR System (CNS) unless otherwise indicated, all protein superimpositions were done using the maximum likelihood-based structure superpositioning program THESEUS. a typical 20-l unwinding reaction mixture contains 8 U of RNasin (RiboLock; Thermo Scientific), 50 mM morpholinepropanesulfonic acid (MOPS)-NaOH (pH 7.0), 5 mM ATP, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.5% Tween 20, 0.1 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin RNAs in the quenched reaction mixtures were resolved by 12% nondenaturing gel electrophoresis. the fluorescent signal of 6-TAMRASE-labeled R20 was detected with a Typhoon 9200 imager (GE Healthcare) with an excitation wavelength of 532 nm and a 580-nm emission filter. initial ATPase catalytic rates were determined based on slope of initial absorbance change and reference standard curve of absorbance versus phosphate concentration determined independently.
