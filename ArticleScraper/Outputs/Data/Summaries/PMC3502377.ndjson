{"summary": "weekly plasma or serum samples collected within 4 weeks before and after diagnosis of lower respiratory tract disease (LRD) were tested for the presence of influenza virus RNA. subjects signed an informed consent permitting use of data and stored samples for research. influenza RNA detection in blood was analyzed as a risk factor for progression to LRD. clinical outcomes included LRD, hypoxemia, respiratory failure, time to death from all causes, and time to influenza-associated death. all statistical analyses were performed with SAS version 9.1. weekly plasma or serum samples collected within 4 weeks before and after diagnosis of lower respiratory tract disease (LRD) were tested for the presence of influenza virus RNA by real-time reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction. subjects signed an informed consent permitting use of data and stored samples for research. influenza if a patient died of respiratory failure and influenza virus was considered to be a contributor to the lung injury. Statistical Analysis We conducted 4 analyses. first, we characterized the occurrence of RNA detection in the blood, and evaluated possible risk factors for its occurrence. second, we determined the overall correlation of detection of influenza viral RNA in blood with clinical outcomes among the entire cohort of HCT recipients. a total of 283 blood samples (113 serum samples and 170 plasma samples) were tested for the presence of influenza viral RNA. an average of 3.6 samples per patient were tested (range, 1\u20138) with a median interval of 7 days. -matched 7 (35.0) 21 (35.6) 28 (35.4) Mismatched or unrelated 8 (40.0) 28 (47.5) 36 (45.6) Stem cell source Bone marrow 6 (30.0) 23 (39.0) 29 (36.7) Peripheral blood 13 (65.0) 34 (57.6) 47 (59.5) Cord blood 1 (5.0) 2 (3.4) 3 (3.8) Conditioning regimen Myeloablative 15 (75.0) 44 (74.6) 59 (74.7) Nonmyelo the day of influenza diagnosis was defined as the day of the first positive bronchoalveolar lavage (for patients with LRD) and nasopharyngeal-throat wash or swab (for patients with URD) sample. influenza viral RNA was detected in 9 out of 79 (11.4%) patients. 3 out of 9 patients with 2009 H1N1 had viral RNA in blood compared with 6 out of 70 patients with seasonal influenza A and B.
