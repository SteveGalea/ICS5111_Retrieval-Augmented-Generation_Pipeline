{"summary": "mixed bacterial infection is especially known to increase mortality and morbidity of influenza. ideal inflammatory biomarkers require accurate discriminatory effects between infectious and noninfectious disease, ability to aid in early detection, and easy application. a retrospective study of adult patients, 18 years and older, was conducted during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. patients were eligible if they were diagnosed as having communityacquired pneumonia caused by 2009 H1N1 influenza infection. 16 exams for atypical pathogens were performed by serum enzyme immunoassay for mycoplasma antibodies, cold agglutinin test, and legionella urine antigen test. organs detected in sputum were considered pathogenic when sputum was qualified with 10 epithelial cells and more than 25 leukocytes per low power field. serum PCT was measured by the VIDAS BRAHMS enzymelinked fluorescence assay (measurement range 005\u2013200 ng/ml; bioMerieux, Lyon, France) and CRP was measured with an automated multichannel analyzer. treatment outcomes were classified into patients whose conditions improved to discharge and those who died following admission. a total of 96 patients were diagnosed with communityacquired pneumonia. the most common bacterial organisms in mixed bacterial infection pneumonia were Streptococcus pneumoniae, followed by Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. the mean age of the 60 patients was 494 189 years, and 33 (550%) were men. patients with 2009 H1N1 pneumonia were younger but this was not statistically significant. the median value for PCT was statistically higher in patients with pneumonia caused by mixed bacterial infection than in patients with 2009 H1N1 pneumonia. other laboratory findings were similar in the two groups. 5) 8 (500) 0142 Chronic lung disease 20 (455) 10 (625) 0243 Malignancy 16 (364) 9 (563) 0167 Clinical presentations, n (%) Sore throat 13 (295) 7 (438) 0302 Rhinorrhea 24 (545) 9 (563) 0907 Headache 20 (455) 7 (438) 0907 Cough 34 (773) 7 (438) 0014* Myalgia 17 (386) 9 (563) 0223 Nause a PCT cutoff of >15 ng/ml best identified patients with mixed infection pneumonia (sensitivity 56%, specificity 84%). sensitivity 56%, specificity 84%. the area under the curve was 0696 (95% CI 0539\u20130852) and a cutoff of >10 ng/ml best identified patients with mixed infection pneumonia (sensitivity 69%, specificity 63%, positive predictive value 41% and negative predictive value 54%) the distribution of PCT and CRP between 2009 H1N1 infection alone and pneumonia caused by mixed infection are also depicted. 96 patients were diagnosed with communityacquired pneumonia. of these 60 patients, 44 had pneumonia caused by 2009 H1N1 infection alone. the most common bacterial organisms in mixed bacterial infection pneumonia were Streptococcus pneumoniae. no difference in gender was found between the two groups. median value for PCT was statistically higher in patients with 2009 H1N1 pneumonia (345 versus 015 ng/ml, P = 0019) myalgia 17 (386) 9 (563) 0223 Nausea/vomiting 17 (386) 7 (438) 0721 Diarrhea 14 (318) 9 (563) 0085 Vital signs (mean SD) SBP (mmHg) 1214 181 1205 232 0785 DBP (mmHg) 718 148 716 145 0621 RR (/min) 238 62 228 72 0776 PR (/min) 1142 240 a PCT cutoff of >15 ng/ml best identified patients with mixed infection pneumonia (sensitivity 56%, specificity 84%, positive predictive value 56% and negative predictive value 84%) for CRP, the area under the curve was 0698. the distribution of PCT and CRP between 2009 H1N1 infection alone and mixed infection pneumonia is also depicted. the accuracy of diagnostic criteria for the detection of mixed infection pneumonia was as follows: sensitivity, 50%; specificity, 93%; positive predictive value, 73%; and negative predictive value, 84%. mixed infection pneumonia is an important contributor to morbidity and mortality during influenza pandemics 7, 8 and also during periods of seasonal influenza. mixed bacterial infection is an important contributor to morbidity and mortality during influenza pandemics 7, 8 and also during periods of seasonal influenza. both PCT and CRP were useful in discriminating viral infection from mixed bacterial infection. the cutoff was 15 ng/ml for PCT, and 10 mg/dl for CRP. indiscriminant antibiotic usage may lead to bacterial resistance and complications of the drug itself. retrospective studies have innate limitations. recent studies have shown that when serum PCT concentration is used to make decisions regarding antibiotics administration and duration, the trend in PCT values over time may be more important than the initial PCT level itself. who.int/csr/don/2010_02_12/en/index.html.
