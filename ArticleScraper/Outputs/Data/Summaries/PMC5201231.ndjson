{"summary": "seasonal influenza has been well studied and be known as one of the main causes of substantial morbidity and mortality. public health interventions can be implemented to prevent and control influenza. studies on age-specific epidemic activity curves could provide key information. there is a growing body of evidence supporting that human mobility may drive the dispersal of influenza virus activity. but this hypothesis has not been supported consistently; some studies questioned the hypothesis that the children actually bring about influenza epidemic fluctuations. the density of the area is about 25 thousand people per square kilometer. the daily children outpatient visits represent more than half of all of the daily children outpatient visits to hospitals in the entire city [17, 18]. wavelet analysis and coherence comparisons were implemented in R version 3.2.4 using the sowas package by [23, 24] following Maraun et al. [23], we estimated the coherence by smoothing 3 periods in the time direction and one octave (0.5 in each direction) in scale direction. the density of the area is about 25 thousand people per square kilometer. the daily children outpatient visits represent more than half of all of the daily children outpatient visits to hospitals in the entire city [17, 18] wavelet analysis and coherence comparisons were implemented in R version 3.2.4 using the sowas package by [23, 24] following maraun et al. [23], we estimated the coherence by smoothing 3 periods in the time direction and one octave (0.5 in each direction) in scale direction. time series of weekly percentage of laboratory-confirmed influenza specimens (LAB) and weekly percentage of clinical consultations for ILI were normalized with mean and standard deviations as zero and one. the irregular shapes of the epidemic curves for. the results of wavelet coherence analysis between LAB and ILI are shown in Fig 2A. the LAB data presented a consistently significant coherence with ILI for the semiannual cycle during 2009\u20132011 and 2014\u20132015. for the semiannual cycle, high coherence was found only in the year 2014. the peak in the 5\u201315-year-old age group appeared much sharper than that of the adults of aged 25\u201360. this phenomenon only appeared during the pandemic, but not in any other peak of the year, such as those in 2011 and 2013\u20132015. there were no clear epidemic periods after 2012, despite two sharp spikes around the winters of 2009 and 2010. wavelet analysis revealed that influenza activities for type A showed a statistically significant annual pattern with one peak in the winter in 2012, 2014 and 2015. the black solid contour lines indicate the regions of power significant at the 95% confidence level which can be assumed to be a true feature. the region outside the black-curved cone indicates the presence of edge effects and is not the evidence for conclusions. weekly percentage of positive laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza A and B (LAB) the power values were colored in Fig 2B. the black solid contour lines indicate the regions of power significant at the 95% confidence level which can be assumed to be true feature. age-specific normalized weekly ILI time series for Ages 0\u20135 (red), Ages 5\u201315 (green), and Ages 25\u201360 (black); phase differences between Ages 0\u20135 and Ages 25\u201360 (red dashed lines) and between Ages 5\u201315 and Ages 25\u201360 (black); type A was the most virulent of the three types of influenza virus. annual cycles were observed in both the laboratory-confirmed influenza and ILI activity data. both disease indicators were highly synchronized for most of the study period. peak timing provides a complementary measure of synchrony between influenza surveillance systems. clinical ILI consultation rates could be a reliable and timely indicator of changes in influenza virus activities in Beijing, a city with temperate climate. laboratory confirmation will likely play an increasingly important role in the development of better methods of early detection and summary measures of influenza activity in key times. the main limitation of the approach we used to study influenza epidemics is that we need to be cautious when interpreting distinctions because it is hard to determine whether it was the epidemic activities among school children that drove the pandemic after 2009 or whether the pandemic itself acted as a major destructive effect on school children."}
