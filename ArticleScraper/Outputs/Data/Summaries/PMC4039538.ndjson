{"summary": "porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (App) are considered pathogens of major importance or relevance for the pig industry. bacterial-viral co-infections can exacerbate the pathogenicity of respiratory pig diseases. the etiological agent, PRRSV, possesses a RNA viral genome with ten open reading frames [8]\u2013[10]. PRRSV virulence is multigenic and resides in both the non-structural and structural viral proteins. the disease induced by PRRSV has many clinical manifestations. in vitro interactions between PRRSV and App in PRRSV permissive cell models were investigated. MARC-145 cells, SJPL cell line and pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAM) were used in this study. cell death induced by App occurs through necrosis and not apoptosis. only a cytotoxicity experiment was performed in order to verify if PRRSV infection increases the cytotoxicity of App. cytotoxicity assays were performed on cells infected with PRRSV for 72 hours. SJPL (A and B) and MARC-145 cells (C and D) were infected with or without PRRSV at an MOI of 0.5 during 72 hours. then cells were co-infected with App (for 1 or 2 hours) (A and C, respectively) or with AppapxIapxIIC (for 4, 5 and 6 hours) (B and D, respectively) at an MOI of 10. Cytotoxicity was measured in % using lactate dehydrogena antiviral activity of App was tested in a porcine relevant cell model. co-infection with AppapxIapxIIC and PRRSV in PAM cells also showed total absence of PRRSV N protein detection. a weak inhibition was observed in MARC-145 cells. pH did not vary between all the tested conditions. PRRSV antigen detection in SJPL, MARC-145 and PAM cells co-infected with AppapxIapxIIC. PRRSV titers were measured to confirm IFA observations. in MARC-145 cells, their antiviral effect on PRRSV replication was markedly less efficient. 4.9 log10 TCID50/ml (which correspond to a 751 fold decrease compared to PRRSV non-treated infected cell) and 6.5 log10 TCID50/ml. PRRSV titer was determined on MARC-145 cells by the K\u00e4rber method. the same results were obtained with all small fractions tested, 3 (Figure S2D), 10 (data not shown) and 50 kDa (Figure S2F). appapxIapxIIC cell culture supernatant 1 kDa fraction antiviral activity against PRRSV. Detection of the N viral protein in PRRSV infected SJPL cells by immunofluorescence. other viruses were tested to verify if this inhibition is virus specific or if it is a general antiviral effect. BVDV-1, Influenza H1N1 and Influenza H3N2 viruses were able to infect and replicate in SJPL cells. treatment with AppapxIapxIIC culture supernatant was performed to verify its spectrum of antiviral activity. 50% of the viruses tested that are able to replicate in SJPL cells (excluding PRRSV) were inhibited by AppapxIapxIIC cell culture supernatant. no modulation of IFN was observed in any of the tested conditions. no modulation of IFN was observed in any of the tested conditions. PRRSV infection in SJPL cells did not modulate IFN mRNA levels. but treatment with AppapxICapxIIC supernantant alone or as co-treatment significantly increased IFN mRNA compared to mock infected SJPL cells. adherence was measured in CFU per well after 1, 2 and 3 hours post bacterial infection. no statistical significance was obtained following two-away ANOVA analysis. all experiments were repeated 3 times. appapxIapxIIC mutant allows longer incubation periods with cells. co-infection with PRRSV and AppapxIapxIIC increased death compared to app single infection. cytotoxicity over time of Appwt or AppapxIapxIIC in PRRSV co-infected SJPL and MARC-145 cells. MARC-145 cells are the most common cells used during in vitro PRRSV studies. only a small reduction of cells expressing the PRRSV N protein was observed following a co-infection with AppapxIapxIIC (Figure 3G) dilutions of AppapxIapxIIC supernatant showed a dose-dependent effect on PRRSV\u2019s detection by IFA. a 12 dilution resulted in twice as much PRRSV N protein when observed with IFA. pictures were taken at 100X magnification for SJPL and MARC-145 cells. titers were measured to confirm IFA observations and quantify the inhibitory effect of AppapxIapxIIC on PRRSV infection. virions to 2.9 log10 TCID50/ml correspond to a 1250 fold decrease. inhibition in PAM is total with live AppapxIapxIIC as observed previously in SJPL cells. fractionation of cell culture supernatant of AppapxIapxIIC indicated that the ihnibitory effect on PRRSV infection is mediated by small App metabolite(s) weighting 1 kDa (Figure 5C) the same results were obtained with all small fractions tested, 3 (Figure S2D), 10 (data not shown) and 50 kDa (Figure S2F). antiviral activity of AppapxIapxIIC cell culture supernatant inhibits PRRSV replication. other viruses were tested in order to verify if this inhibition is virus specific or if it is a general antiviral effect. Viruses Virus titer Relative virus replication inhibition Without AppapxIapxIIC With AppapxIapxIIC (TCID50 log10 SD) DNA genome BHV-4 Neg - CPV Neg - - PCV2 Neg - - BAV3 2.750.35 2.880.18 0.742.45 BHV-1 4.540.48 4.420.59 1.325.75 EHV-1 4.380.18 no modulation of IFN was observed in any of the tested conditions, including the Poly I:C control. PRRSV infection in SJPL cells significantly increased IFN mRNA compared to mock infected cells. no modulation of App adherence was observed when cells were infected with PRRSV. appwt induced, as expected, a high percentage of cytotoxicity in SJPL cells. however, co-infection with PRRSV and AppapxIapxIIC did not result in a significant increase of cell death compared to PRRSV alone. inhibition of PRRSV replication by AppapxIapxIIC is not generated by contact between bacterial and eukaryotic host cell. this antiviral effect is not only observed in SJPL cells but also in the PRRSV natural host target cells, i.e. PAM. the difference in PRRSV infection between both cell lines could explain the difference observed for the AppapxIapxIIC supernatant antiviral activity. the difference in PRRSV infection between both cell lines could explain the difference observed for the type I IFNs. apxIapxIIC supernatant alone and in PRRSV + AppapxIapxIIC supernatant condition. it may give a clue by which cellular response AppapxIapxIIC supernatant induces its antiviral effect. it is not known if SJPL cells possess IFN receptors. there is no commercially available antiviral drug against PRRSV on the market. this is the first description of an App antiviral activity. this study might lead to the development of a new antiviral molecule against PRRSV. porcine lung epithelial cell was provided by Dr. R.G. Webster (St. Jude Children\u2019s Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA) this cell line was grown in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS (Wisent Inc), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 M MEM nonessential amino acid, 10 U/mL of penicillin, 10 app strains were cultured on brain heart infusion (BHI) broth and/or agar (Gibco) supplemented with 15 g/ml nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) non-adherent bacteria were removed by washing four times with DPBS. cells with adherent bacteria were released from the wells by adding 100 l of 1X trypsin-EDTA (Gibco) Optical densities were measured at 490 nm with a Power Wave X340 microplate reader. the presence of PRRSV antigens in infected cells was determined by an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) cells were infected or treated as described below. cell culture supernatants were resuspended at an MOI of 10 in a rocking petri dish. resuspended AppapxIapxIIC at an MOI of 10 were inactivated for 2 hours under UV light. appapxIapxIIC supernatant was also diluted 12, 110, 120, 140. one ml of suspensions was added to each well 4 hours after PRRSV infection. samples infected by the virus were subject to three cycles of freeze-thaw.
