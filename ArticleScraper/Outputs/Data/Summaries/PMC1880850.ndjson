{"summary": "new prophylactic and therapeutic strategies are needed to combat human infections with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses. mAbs FLA3.14 and FLD20.19 neutralized both Clade I and Clade II H5N1 viruses. in vitro, mAbs FLA3.14 and FLD20.19 neutralized both Clade I and Clade II H5N1 viruses. every year, millions of people catch influenza, a viral disease of the nose, throat, and airways. epidemics kill about half a million people annually. experts believe another pandemic is overdue and may be triggered by the avian H5N1 influenza virus. new preventative and therapeutic strategies are needed to combat human infections with H5N1. passive immunotherapy involves treating people with antibodies that can stop H5N1 from infecting cells (so-called neutralizing antibodies) patients who have survived infection with H5N1 make neutralizing antibodies, so the researchers isolated and immortalized the immune cells. monoclonal antibodies could help combat avian H5N1 if (or when) it starts a human pandemic. a crude form of the approach halved the death rate during the spanish flu pandemic. a virus capable of efficient human-to-human transmission could result from either adaptation of the HPAI H5N1 viruses and/or reassortment of the virus genome with that of a circulating human influenza virus. in humans, overall mortality in HPAI H5N1 infection exceeds 60%, with variation according to the patient's age and the year of infection. antibody therapy using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is effectively used as prophylaxis against varicella, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, rabies, and respiratory syncytial virus infections. specific mAbs can confer prophylactic and therapeutic protection in mice [9\u201311]. four adult blood donors in this study were diagnosed with HPAI H5N1 influenza between January 2004 and February 2005. the clinical features of acute disease in three of the four patients have been described previously (patients #5, #7, and #8 in the online supplement to [7] supernatants were incubated with 100 TCID50 of virus for 1 h at room temperature. plasma samples were tested at a starting dilution of 1:10. supernatants were tested at a starting dilution of 1:8 and residual infectivity was tested in four wells per dilution. PBMCs were thawed and stained with antibodies to CD22+ IgM, IgD, and IgA. cells were immortalized at 30 B cells/well in replicate cultures using a FACSAria (Becton Dickinson, http://www.bdbiosciences.com) cells were cultured in complete RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. the isotype, subclass, and light chain of the mAbs were characterized by ELISA using specific antibodies and HRP-labeled anti-human Ig antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, http://www.sigmaaldrich.com). the antibodies were quantified with reference to a standard certified preparation (Sigma-Aldrich, http://www.sigmaaldrich.com). mice were first infected i.n. with 5 LD50 of A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) then 24, 48, or 72 h later they were injected i.p. with 1 ml of a mAb preparation. pathology Mice were necropsied and the lungs were inflated with 10% neutral buffered buffered formalin. sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. ABC immunohistochemistry was performed using a goat antibody to avian influenza H5 Goat Alpha H5 diluted at 1:1,000. all patients had detectable neutralizing antibody titers to their autologous virus. all patients provided written informed consent. influenza Viruses geneBank accession numbers for the genomic sequences of the H5N1 viruses isolated from subjects CL26 (A/Vietnam/CL26/2004), CL36 (A/Vietnam/CL36/2004) and CL115 (A/Vietnam/CL115/2005) have been published previously [3]. supernatants were incubated with 100 TCID50 of virus for 1 h. plasma samples were tested at a starting dilution of 1:10. supernatants were tested at a starting dilution of 1:8. residual infectivity was tested in four wells per dilution. cells were cultured in complete RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. supernatants were harvested after 14 days and assayed for neutralizing activity against 100 TCID50 of influenza A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) mice were injected with 1 ml of various antibody preparations or hyperimmune sheep antisera raised against baculovirus expressed HA of A/VN/1203/2004 (H5N1). mice were bled to collect samples for measurement of neutralizing human mAb titers, then challenged intranasally (i.n.) with 105 TCID50 of A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) or A/Indone mice were first infected i.n. with 5 LD50 of A/Indonesia/5/2005 (H5N1). then 24, 48, or 72 h later they were injected i.p. with 1 ml of a mAb preparation. pathology was evaluated in a semiquantitative manner by a pathologist. the Mann-Whitney U test was used to measure differences in viral loads in mice. samples with undetectable viral burdens were given the value 1.5 log10 TCID/g. all analyses were performed in Stata 8.2 software. more distant HPAI H5N1 strains, including the Clade II H5N1 virus A/Indonesia/5/2005, were neutralized by FLA3.14 and FLD20.19. however, none of these clones neutralized an H3N2 influenza virus, A/California/7/2004. all preparations of mAb FLA5.10 conferred 100% protection from lethality by A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1). mAb FLA3.14 also conferred some protection from lethal A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) infection, but with lower efficacy and in a dose-dependent manner. mice receiving the highest dose of FLA3.14 were as susceptible as mice receiving a human mAb of irrelevant specificity. mAbs FLA3.14 and FLA5.10 conferred protection from lethal infection. the lowest dose of FLA3.14 delayed time to death. the lowest dose of FLA3.14 (1 mg/kg) delayed time to death. s with FLA5.10 prophylaxis had less dramatic pathological changes in the pulmonary airways and parenchymal tissue. fewer inflammatory interstitial lesions in which H5 antigen was detected by immunohistochemical staining in the lung sections of mice given FLA5.10 relative to the control antibody, D2.2. either FLA3.14 or FLA5.10 than mice that had received the control mAb, D2.2. the lower limit of detection (1.5 log10 TCID50/g) is shown. established infection represents a clinically relevant endpoint for antiviral therapy against H5N1 infection. efficacy of treatment with FLA3.14, FLA5.10, FLD20.19, and FLD21.140 was determined in BALB/c mice i.n. infected 24, 48, or 72 h previously with 5 LD50 of A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) a factor found in vivo enhances the neutralizing activity of this mAb. this mAb therapy for at least 72 h postinfection in the mouse model can markedly improve survival from highly virulent H5N1 infection. these data also imply it is possible to obtain significant cross-protection against a Clade II H5N1 virus. postinfection therapy at 24 h with mAbs FLA3.14, FLD20.19, or FLD21.140, but not FLA5.10 or D2.2, was associated with absolute protection from lethal infection. the risk of a devastating human influenza pandemic caused by an H5N1 influenza strain remains difficult to quantify. patients with fatal H5N1 infections had high viral loads in the respiratory tract, hypercytokinemia, multiple organ dysfunction, and acute respiratory distress syndrome [3]. a recent review of these studies suggested this treatment was associated with a halving in mortality (37% to 16%) and that early treatment was associated with greater benefits [16] the mAbs produced in this study were derived from immortalized memory B cells of donors who had recovered from H5N1 infection. compared with the yield of neutralizing B cells we previously derived from patients who had recovered from SARS coronavirus infection [19], donor-derived B cell clones that neutralized H5N1 influenza were relatively scarce. the only mAb licensed for use against a viral agent (respiratory syncytial virus) is used at 15 mg/kg of body weight. the ongoing process of antigenic variation in antibody binding sites, called antigenic drift, represents a challenge to vaccine design and also to therapy using mAbs. HA sequences of the H5N1 viruses discussed in this paper are A/Vietnam/CL115/2005 (DQ497727), A/Vietnam/CL26/2004 (DQ497723) and A/Vietnam/CL36/2005 (DQ497724)."}
