{"summary": "foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is a highly contagious infectious agent inducing disease of cloven-hoofed animals including cattle, swine, goats and sheep. its high mutation rate contributes to immune escape and the presence of seven serotypes (O, A, C, Asia-1, South African Territories 1, 2 and 3) each containing a large variety of isolates with high antigenic variability. mononuclear cells produce high amount of antiviral type-I IFN. pDC activation is mediated by sensing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP) through pattern recognition receptors (PRR) by expressing PRR, such as toll-like receptors (TLR) and C-type lectin receptors, pDC contribute to the innate and adaptive antiviral immunity [10]. PBMC cultured in modified Eagle\u2019s minimal essential medium (DMEM) 21 cells were grown in Glasgow\u2019s minimum essential medium (GMEM, Life Technologies) supplemented with 5% v/v Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS, South America Origin, Biowest, Nuaill\u00e9, France) cells were cultured in FBS-free GMEM at 37\u00b0C, 6% CO2. the sorted population was identified as CD4highCD172alow cells by flow cytometry detection. the pDC population was identified as CD4highCD172alow cells by flow cytometry. the isolates were not passaged more than three times in BHK-21 cells. the neutralization titre was calculated according to Kaerber [18] based on FMDV-induced cytopathogenic effect. induction of type-I IFN and inhibition of the TLR7 pathway Isolated PBMC and sorted cells (4 106cells/mL) were stimulated in 100 L of serum-free medium. mAbs CAM36A, 8E6 and PT90A were purchased from VMRD (Pullman, WA, USA) PBMC were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s minimal essential medium (DMEM) pDC were enriched either using CD172a positive selection with LD columns or by a first depletion of CD14+ cells with a subsequent positive selection for CD14+ cells. PBMC were isolated using Ficoll Paque and Optiprep (60% w/v solution of oidixanol in water, Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA) two pigs were immunized intra-muscularly with the full-dose of a monovalent FMDV vaccine consisting of inactivated type-O Manisa antigen. at day 0, 14, 21, 28, and 42, blood samples were taken and serum prepared for storage at -20\u00b0C. a nave animal of the same litter was used as controls. pDC activation by influenza virus employed an multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 TCID50/cell. supernatants from enriched pDC were harvested after 24 h. pDC were only enriched about 5-10 fold from PBMC using a CD172a positive selection by magnetic cell sorting. pDCs were gated based on their CD4highCD172alow phenotype. the cells were stimulated for 24 h at 39\u00b0C with 10 g/mL of CpG D32, medium (B), or FMDV O UKG 2001 at a MOI of 5 TCID50/cell (C). CD3-depleted/CD4-enriched PBMC were compared with the CD14-depleted/CD172a-enriched PBMC. the number of cells obtained upon enrichment was higher with the latter protocol, the CD14 depletion/CD172a enrichment method was employed for the following experiments. IFN- was measured in the supernatants by ELISA. the bars represent the mean value of triplicates and the errors bars show the standard deviation. the data are representative of three independent experiments. the NT of the serum against the two viruses is expressed in log10 of serum dilution. the same approach was applied for O Bulgaria 1/91, a high IFN-inducing FMDV isolate. immuno-regulatory sequence 661 (IRS661) representing an ODN inhibitor of TLR7. we found that complement is not required for the enhancement of IFN- by immune-serum. 0.8\u20133.3 M of IRS661 inhibited 60\u201370% of IFN- production. FMDV O UKG 2001 was not able to activate pDC in presence of IRS661. the control ODN did not influence IFN- production of pDC. an anti-O Manisa serum was employed and tested against FMDV O UKG 2001 (NT of 4.1 log10) and against A Brazil 10/93 (NT below detection limit) also the maximum IFN- production was reached at the same serum dilution of 3 log10 with both FMDV isolates. similar results were also obtained with another serum sample obtained from a second vaccinated pig. IFN- in supernatants was measured by ELISA. values are shown as box plots representing of 3-5 independent experiments. the black line represents the median value and the red line the mean value. pDC were only enriched about 5-10 fold from PBMC using a CD172alow. this resulted in a frequency of 3-5% of pDC (20 fold enrichment) depending on the experiment. pDCs were gated based on their CD4highCD172alow. the cells were stimulated for 24 h at 39\u00b0C with 10 g/mL of CpG D32, medium (B), or FMDV O UKG 2001 at a MOI of 5 TCID50/cell (C). the bars represent the mean value of triplicates and the errors bars show the standard deviation. pDC activation by FMDV varies between different FMDV isolates. we tested more FMDV isolates for their ability to activate pDC at an MOI of 5 TCID50/cell. a serum with a neutralization titre (NT) of 4.1 log10 at dilutions below 1 log10 did not induce pDC activation. such high serum concentrations showed suppressive effects on pDC stimulation by FMDV, which were independent on the immune status of the donor animal. the same approach was applied for O Bulgaria 1/91, a high IFN-inducing FMDV isolate. the serum employed showed a NT of 3.1 log10 against this virus. low MOIs have to be employed to measure antibody-dependent enhancement of IFN- responses. immuno-serum, and heat-labile serum factors could even have a suppressive effect. all further experiments were performed with heat-treated serum. IRS661 inhibited 60\u201370% of IFN- production induced by influenza virus. FMDV O UKG 2001 was not able to activate pDC in presence of IRS661. similar levels of inhibition were also observed with other FMDV isolates. opsonising activity against both viruses was observed at a similar serum dilution between 2 to 4 log10. also the maximum IFN- production was reached at the same serum dilution of 3 log10 with both FMDV isolates. similar results were also obtained with another serum sample obtained from a second vaccinated pig. NT and opsonisation titres (OT) representing the highest serum dilution able to opsonise FMDV for enhanced IFN- responses. as expected the immune serum was only able to neutralize the O serotype viruses O, A, C and Asia-1. non-enveloped viruses such as FMDV have been shown to be unable to trigger pDC activation in vitro unless the cells are stimulated with immune complexed virus. however, in the present study we demonstrate that both immune-complexed FMDV and uncomplexed FMDV activate pDC via TLR7. the differences we observed with pDC are not related to a cell culture adaptation of certain FMDV isolates to heparin sulphate binding. this study found no differences in the ability to activate pDC. on the other hand, the leader proteinase Lpro inhibiting the type-I IFN pathway [28] is variable among serotypes [29] and could contribute to a isolate-specific FMDV counteraction on the IFN- induction in pDC. serotypes A and C are more distant, partially explaining our findings. this opsonisation efficiently occurred with serum dilutions similar to those required for neutralization. this would indicate that the type of antibodies and their specificities is similar for both functions. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors' contributions Conceived and design the experiments: AS, NL."}
