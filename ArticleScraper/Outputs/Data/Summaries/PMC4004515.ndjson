{"summary": "the 3a protein functions as an ion channel, induces apoptosis and is important for viral pathogenesis. it is expressed on the cell surface and contains a tyrosine-based sorting motif and a di-acidic motif, which may be crucial for its intracellular trafficking. however the role of these motifs is not fully understood in case of 3a protein. the etiological agent of the disease, the SARS Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified and classified as a unique member of beta Coronavirus. the etiological agent of the disease, the SARS-CoV, carries a 30 kb positive-sense RNA genome that contains 8 unique open reading frames. the Orf3A encodes a protein of 274 amino acids. the 3a protein lacking both of these motifs failed to express on the cell surface. mutation in the YXX or EXD motif does not impact the release. the YXX motif can also mediate interaction with other members of the clathrin complex. the tyrosine based sorting motif (YXX) of the 3a protein is responsible for its sorting from the Golgi to plasma membrane. most of the YXX mutants are retained in Golgi and lipid droplets. the 3a protein is required for its trafficking to the plasma membrane. YXX motif is conserved in all the isolates studied where as the EXD motif is mutated in all the seven bat isolates and one out of 21 human isolates. the YXX motif was shown to be crucial for endocytosis from the cell surface [19].

YXX mutant protein localized with late endosome/lysosomal marker Rab7. both of these led to 3 to 5 fold increased levels of the YXX mutant protein. mutation of the tyrosine-based sorting motif causes abnormal trafficking of the 3a protein leading to increased accumulation in the Golgi compartment. the 274 amino acids (aa) long 3a protein contains three potential transmembrane regions between residues 34\u201356, 77\u201399 and 103\u2013125. the cytoplasmic domain of 3a also contains a tyrosine-based sorting motif, YXX (aa 160\u2013163) and a di-acidic motif, EXD (aa 171\u2013173) the amino acid changes in the YXX and EXD mutants are indicated. an N terminal c-Myc epitope tag is attached to all the constructs.

Western blotting was done with anti-3a and ERK (loading control) antibodies. a mutant 3a protein lacking this motif was efficiently transported from the ER to Golgi and the plasma membrane. so, the EXD motif does not function as an ER export signal in many proteins. we also found the 3a protein of SARS-CoV to be localized to lipid droplets. the wild type 3a protein or the EXD mutant are sorted efficiently from the ER and Golgi to the plasma membrane. the mutant protein fails to reach the plasma membrane as it gets stuck in the Golgi compartment. this mutant protein is then targeted to lipid droplets. tamine, 1.5 g/lit sodium bicarbonate, 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, 100 U penicillin and 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) anti-3a antibodies were generated using the purified cytoplasmic domain of the 3a protein. cytoplasmic domain of the protein was cloned into the eukaryotic plasmid vector pSGI-HA. transfected cells were harvested in PBS 48 hr post-transfection. western blotting was done after lysing the cells with lysis buffer. western blotting was done after lysing them with protease inhibitors. the cells were washed thrice for 5 min each with PBS and then incubated with a 1:200 dilution of the relevant secondary antibodies conjugated with either Alexa 488 or Alexa 594. the coverslips were mounted on slides with antifade reagent (Bio-Rad, USA) and sealed with a synthetic rubber-based adhesive (Fevicol; Pidilite Industries, India) in vitro transcription and translation The gene to be expressed was cloned downstream of a T7 promoter in the pSGI expression vector [29] plasmid was then added to the reaction mixture containing T7 polymerase, amino-acid mixture (lacking methionine), appropriate buffer and rabbit reticulocyte lysate according to manufacturer\u2019s guidelines. ic domain were cloned into pSGI-HA to give expression vectors pSGI-3A-HA and pSGI-3ACyto-HA. c-Myc-tag was added to the mutant by taking c-Myc-epitope tag from pGBKT7 vectors. site directed mutagenesis was carried out using the QuickChange site directed mutagenesis kit system (Stratagene) semi-quantitative RT-PCR RNA was isolated from transfected cells 48 hr post-transfection using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) equal amounts of RNA were taken for reverse transcription using Superscript reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies) confocal images were collected using a 60x objective in a bio-Rad Radiance 2001 laser-scanning confocal system attached to a Nikon Eclipse TE-2000U inverted microscope. cells were cotransfected to express the required protein and a relevant fluorescent subcellular marker. authors\u2019 contribution K.P. conceived and designed the experiments.
