{"summary": "parasitologists quantify parasite generalism (or specificity) by number of host species that a parasite can infect. this is because simple metrics do not characterize all dimensions of parasite generalism. they are often not calibrated against null expectations. this is because simple metrics do not fully characterize all dimensions of parasite generalism. the rapid development in integrating information on evolutionary history has inspired recent research aimed at bringing an evolutionary perspective to the mechanisms underlying parasite generalism. we quantify the phylogenetic relatedness among host species infected by the same parasite, i.e. mammalian parasites capable of infecting multiple host species from disparate evolutionary lineages. two recent studies uncovered substantial variation in the degree of phylogenetic generalism. most parasites infecting multiple primate hosts appeared to be phylogenetic generalists. but for carnivores, many multi-host parasites were constrained by host phylogeny, especially helminths and viruses. the GMPD data were analysed in R [35] to establish the number and identity of parasite species per host species and the number and identity of host species per parasite species. the analysis includes 404 terrestrial mammal host species. previous work has demonstrated that pairwise distance metrics are not generally biased by small differences in phylogenetic topology [38]. for the set of hosts of each parasite species, the mean pairwise PD between hosts was calculated, as was its standard effect size [39]. a null model was also explored in the electronic supplementary material. the null model allows the calculation of standard effect sizes that return a z-score and a p-value. scores in interval 1.96 z +1.96 are equivalent to a random host set. negative z-scores indicate that a parasite species tends to infect host species that are more closely related than expected by chance. negative values indicate that a parasite species tends to infect host species that are more closely related than expected by chance. null model that ignores the frequency of host records (unweighted) in the GMPD compared patterns with the weighted null model used here (electronic supplementary material, figure S2) standard effect sizes are highly correlated across the two null models. viruses and bacteria are the parasite types most likely to be re-classified as phylogenetic specialists in an unweighted null model. helminths tend to be more consistent in their degree of generalism. helminths contain relatively few species that are at either extreme of the generalism\u2013specialism spectrum. the mean standard effect size is very close between the two types. the x-axes provide a standard effect size of maximum pairwise PD of a parasite's host set (span) and the y-axes provide a standard effect size of the ratio of mean minimum pairwise PD to maximum pairwise PD (aggregation) circled bacterial and protozoan parasites are Leptospira interrogans and Trypanosoma cruzi. these parasites have a similar span (x 0), but very each model was fitted with and without the inclusion of a second predictor variable, the number of host records in the GMPD, which was used to control for sampling bias. only one model showed that more evolutionarily distinct hosts (but not those subtending from longer terminal branches) had significantly fewer parasite species. primate parasite research used taxonomy to classify host specificity. protozoan and viral parasites exhibit specialism when transmission is through close contact. some caution must be applied when jointly considering parasite type and transmission mode. phylogenetic patterns in the hosts of parasites can represent multiple drivers of parasite sharing. these include geographical ranges of hosts [17], although the relationship between host species relatedness and range overlap is complex. phylogenetic patterns in the hosts of parasites can represent multiple drivers of parasite sharing. taxonomically biased sample compared to single-host parasites. we have established the likely biases associated with well-studied host species. some parasite types may disproportionately represent low or near-zero fitness associations with hosts. if a parasite has only two host species, then picking many pairs of host species at random may be more likely to result in the observation occurring towards the centre of the distribution of random relatedness. the variation in host richness may be partly attributed to the fact that some parasites are simply studied less than others, or hosts that harbour a particular parasite may be sampled less often. the explicit inclusion of geography is a promising line of macroecological inquiry that could provide further insights into parasite host range. by extending taxonomic definitions of generalism, using a large set of host and parasite species, the nuanced patterns of host\u2013parasite associations are clarified. further biological interpretation will require extensive accumulation and accessibility of additional variables known to impact host specificity.
