{"summary": "mice with coronavirus-induced encephalomyelitis (CIE) and age-matched controls were cut into 5\u20137 strips and suspended in physiological muscle baths. results The maximum effect of EFS was not significantly different between CIE and control bladders. pathologic changes in the mucosa resulting from demyelination in the CNS. a collection of symptoms including urgency and frequency of micturition, incontinence, incomplete emptying, hesitancy, weak urine stream and urinary retention are common in MS patients. mice with EAE show micturition symptoms common to MS patients. detrusor hyperactivity, shortened intermicturition intervals, decreased voiding volumes, morphology changes and fibrosis in the bladder. a better understanding of pathological changes in bladder innervation and effects of nerve degeneration on the contractile mechanisms of the detrusor will lead to the development of much-needed treatment options. onavirus-induced encephalomyelitis (CIE) male mice were injected with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV, A59 strain, 5,000 PFU) in 20 l of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) intracranially. a Clinical Symptom Score (CSS) was determined for each animal. most animals show significant CSS scores within a few days. staining in mouse bladder wall (A) and pudendal nerve (C) was similar to age matched control mouse bladder wall (B) and pudendal nerve (D) for reference. no evidence of peripheral demyelination in CIE mice compared with age matched control (D) for reference. hoctramine (0.1, 10, or 100 M, n = 4\u20136 per condition) or competitive M3 selective antagonist darifenacin (1, 3, or 10 nM, n = 4\u20136 per condition) hoctramine concentrations from 0.1 M up to 10 mM were used with approximately 3 minutes intervals before the next concentration of bethanechol. tter II (Med-Lab Instruments, Loveland, CO) power amplifier. a frequency response curve was constructed for each strip (2, 5, 12, 20, and 30 Hz) the strips were allowed to equilibrate 2 minutes before the next stimulation. following this frequency response, the strips were exposed to either 1 M atropine or 30 M of,-methylene ATP for 30 minutes. a total of 918 measurements were made per layer and per bladder. the average thickness of each layer automatically generated at 10 m intervals. statistical differences were determined by either Student\u2019s t-test or a nonparametric statistic. mouse hepatitis virus (MHV, A59 strain, 5,000 PFU) were injected with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) intracranially in 20 l of phosphate buffered saline. a clinical symptom score was determined for each animal. most animals show significant CSS scores within a few days. the bladders were cut into longitudinal strips approximately 2 mm wide and 5\u20136 mm long. the bladder strips were then suspended with 0.75 g of tension in tissue baths containing 10 ml of modified Tyrode\u2019s solution (125 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 0.4 mM NaH2PO4, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 23.8 mM NaHCO3, and 5.6 ifenacin (1, 3, or 10 nM, n = 4\u20136 per condition) was used with approximately 3 minutes intervals before the next concentration of bethanechol. a frequency response curve was constructed for each strip (2,. the strips were allowed to equilibrate 2 minutes before the next stimulation. after this frequency response, the strips were exposed to either 1 M atropine or 30 M of,-methylene ATP for 30 minutes. a third frequency response was performed after the last treatments. a total of 918 measurements were made per layer and per bladder. the results averaged for each layer and bladder. the variance between groups was non-homogenous. there was no difference in the CXA between mucosa denuded CIE (0.210.01 mm2) and mucosa denuded control bladder strips (0.210.01 mm2) in mucosa intact bladder strips, the CXA was significantly (p0.01) greater in bladder strips from CIE (0.410.02 mm2) compared to control mice (0.290.01 mm2). this suggests there is mucosal hypertrophy, but not muscle hypertrophy in CIE insets showing detail of urothelial layer were compared using bioQuant image analysis software. average layer thickness was compared between mice, such that N reflected the number of mice. in age matched control mice, the maximum bethanechol-induced contraction was significantly less in mucosa denuded compared to mucosa intact bladder strips. this suggests that the mucosa augments the cholinergic-induced maximal contraction in control. removal of the mucosa from control or CIE mouse bladders had no effect on the potency of bethanechol to induce contraction. intact 755.2 102.0 9.2 (9.0\u20139.4) 6.4 (6.0\u20136.8) CIE denuded 691.7 141.5 9.9 (9.0\u20139.4) 6.1 (5.9\u20136.3) Potency values were determined by Schild analysis for the M3 selective antagonist darifenacin and the M2 selective antagonist methoctramine. there were no differences in the maximum contraction to,-methylene ATP between control and CIE bladder strips, either mucosa denuded or mucosa intact. the EC50 values were similar for all groups, ranging from 1.4 to 1.9 M. EFS (12 V, 1 ms pulse duration) was used to induce nerve-evoked contractions in aged-matched control (A) and CIE (B) mouse bladder strips. the data is presented as the percent of the high potassium-induced contraction. the data is presented as the percent of the high potassium-induced contraction. cholinergic and purinergic components of nerve-evoked contractions were quite different in mucosa intact CIE mouse bladder strips. cholinergic stimulation (Figure 8A, open squares) mediated 553% while cholinergic stimulation (Figure 8C, open circles) mediated 467% of the maximal nerve-evoked contractions. mice with CIE (N = 54) weighed significantly less (p0.01) than controls. weight of bladders from mice with CIE was not different in comparison to bladders from control mice (23.51 mg and 23.10.5 mg respectively) elin basic protein was observed within the bladder wall and pudendal nerve of CIE mice. no evidence of peripheral demyelination was observed in this model. the data is presented in terms of both grams and grams per cross sectional area (g/mm2) CON denotes age-matched control. effect of CIE on exogenous bethanechol-induced contraction. subtype selective muscarinic receptor antagonist darifenacin was highly potent for inhibition of bethanechol-induced contraction in both mucosa intact CIE and control bladder strips. removal of the mucosa significantly increased darifenacin potency in both CIE and control bladder strips. the M2 selective antagonist methoctramine had low potency for inhibition of bethanechol-induced contraction of mucosa intact and mucosa denuded CIE and control bladders. there was no difference in the maximum nerve-evoked contraction between mucosa intact and mucosa denuded. removal of the mucosa from control and CIE mice significantly reduced the maximal nerve-evoked contraction at frequencies of 5 Hz and above. this suggests that the mucosa augments nerve-evoked contraction in control but not in CIE bladders, possibly, through nerve-mediated release of either acetylcholine (ACh) or ATP from the mucosa. cholinergic and purinergic components of nerve-evoked contractions were quite different in mucosa intact CIE mouse bladder strips. purinergic stimulation (Figure 8A, open squares) mediated 553% while cholinergic stimulation (Figure 8C, open circles) mediated 467% of the maximum nerve-evoked contractions. mice have shortened inter-micturition intervals, lower voided volumes, and an elevated number of non-voiding contractions in comparison with controls. a previous study showed increased urothelial permeability within several hours of spinal cord injury in rats. in normal mice, a purinergic component of nerve-evoked contractions was observed. removal of the mucosa did not alter the relative magnitude of either the purinergic or cholinergic components of nerve-evoked contractions. mucosa from CIE mouse bladder decreases the cholinergic component of nerve-evoked contraction, while augmenting the purinergic component. the urothelium is known to release various substances, such as ACh, ATP, nitric oxide, and prostaglandins. these substances could have either inhibitory or augmenting effects on muscarinic receptor-mediated detrusor contractions. there is also evidence for a mucosal-derived, yet unidentified, factor that inhibits bladder contraction. our subtype-selective antagonist data support the role of the M3 receptor predominantly mediating the contraction. urothelial M2 receptors have been shown to mediate the release of ATP and PGE2. this may suggest that mucosal M2 receptors participate in the bethanechol-induced contraction of these strips. a distinct phenotype of neurogenic bladder dysfunction is observed. this is characterized by an increased number of non-voiding contractions and shortened inter-micturition interval. previous studies have shown a tight link between the urothelium and nervous system. caused suppression of muscarinic receptor-mediated contractile response. augmentation of purinergic response of smooth muscle."}
