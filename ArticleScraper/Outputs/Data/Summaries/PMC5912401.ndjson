{"summary": "isoenzymes of 44 previously reported isolates were obtained from fresh cultures and extracted using glass beads. nine isoenzymes were investigated using multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (MLEE) several investigators have observed an increase in the amount of microorganisms during clinical procedures in a dental environment. Streptococcus viridans and Staphylococcus spp. are the most prevalent microorganisms found on the surfaces of dental equipment 12, which includes the methicillin-resistant S. aureus. MLEE data are considered representative of the whole genome of an organism and form a good basis for population genetic studies of bacteria, fungi, and protozoa. MLEE data are considered representative of the whole genome of an organism and form a good basis for population genetic studies. aureus isolates were isolated, identified, and had their resistance profiles performed as described in a previous study. the bacteria were passively harvested from a clinical environment (the air) in the academic clinic (Dental School) pellets were transferred to 2 mL microtubes containing 250 mL PBS and 250 mg glass beads (0.45-0.55 mm) these mixtures were kept on ice (4\u00b0) for 5 min and then agitated 4 times in a beadBeater\u00ae (Biospec Products, Inc.; Bartlesville, OK, USA) at 4,200 rpm for 30 s with one-minute intervals. gels were put on acrylic base and sliced into 1.5-mm sections with the aid of rulers and #15 nylon strings. sections were carefully placed inside white porcelain containers and stained for 9 enzymes (14 enzymatic loci) 28. eles over the 14 enzyme loci examined resulted in an electrophoretic type (ET) \u2013 subtype or strain 28. discriminatory power was established using the numerical index of discrimination (D) this probability can be calculated using Simpson's index of diversity, developed to describe species' diversity within an ecological habitat. a tree with two-dimensional classifications (dendrogram), based on matrix dij, was generated using the SAHN grouping method (Sequential, Agglomerative, Hierarchic, Nonoverlapping clustering methods) a threshold (average value:dij) was established in the dendrograms to identify clusters of identical isolates and highly related isolates. r j k = i = 1 n ( X i j X k ) i = 1 n ( X i j X k ) 2 i = 1 n ( X i j X k ) 2 i = 1 n ( X i j X k ) 2 i = 1 n ( X i j X k ) 2 i = 1 n ( cultures were grown in flasks containing 200 mL BHI (Brain Heart Infusion) culture medium. cells were centrifuged at 5,000g for 3 min and washed in sterile 40 mM PBS (pH 7.5) three times. the upper aqueous phase was applied to Whatman #3 filter papers wicks (125 mm) and maintained at -70\u00b0C until use 3, 28. electrophoresis and specific enzyme stainings The enzymes were separated in 13% (wt/vol) penetrose 30\u00ae starch gels (dimensions 20012010 mm) enzymatic expression levels of alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh-1 and Adh-2), mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase (M1p-1 and M1p-2), malate dehydrogenase (Mdh-1 and Mdh-2), and a- and b-esterase (EC 3.1.1.1) identified two genetically interpretative loci. the probability that two consecutively sampled isolates will belong to that type (strain) this summation can be subtracted from 1 to obtain the equation above. this equation can be applied both to a direct comparison of the discriminating power of typing methods and to an analysis of the discriminating power. a tree with two-dimensional classifications (dendrogram) was generated using the SAHN grouping method (Sequential, Agglomerative, Hierarchic, Nonoverlapping clustering methods) a threshold (average value:dij) was established in the dendrograms to identify clusters of identical isolates and highly related isolates and taxa. y unit (OTU) j, Xiis the mean of all state values for OTU j, and n is the number of characters sampled] was used as a measure of the agreement between the genetic distance values implied by the UPGMA dendrograms and the ones from the original genetic distance matrices (dij) these agreements were interpreted as follows: r>0.9, very good fit; 0.8r0.9, good fit; 0.7r0.8, poor fit; r a 98.6% probability that two unrelated S. aureus isolates will be classified as different types (strains or ETs) the migration of the enzymes occurred from the negative pole (cathode) to the positive pole (anode) the isolates are labeled from left to right 1 to 44 (TS corresponds to the S. aureus type strain \u2013 ATCC\u00ae 29213) cluster I: 18 highly related and/or identical isolates 40.9% (isolates 3 ET17 \u2013 area E, 7 ET17 \u2013 area B, 9 ET15 \u2013 area E, 10 ET15 \u2013 area I, 11 ET12 \u2013 area K, 15 ET3 \u2013 area F, 18 ET10 \u2013 area B, 20 ET17 \u2013 area C, 23 ET2 \u2013 area A, 28 ET16 \u2013 area G, 29 ET16 \u2013 area K, 30 ET4 \u2013 area taxon B comprised one isolate (isolate 8 ET28 - area F) and two moderately related clusters (V and VI; totaling 7 isolates 15.9% or 6 ETs 18.2%) taxon C comprised two isolates (4 ET32 - area F and 33 ET29 - area C) and one moderately related cluster (VII; totaling 4 isolates 9.1% or 4 ETs 12.1%) the letters A to L are the sampling sites (Cluster I, Cluster II, Cluster III, Cluster IV, and isolates nonclustered*) MLEE allows for evaluations of genetic diversity and population structure analyses and provides a high discriminatory power and reproducibility 2. a certain structural genetic locus is defined as polymorphic when the frequency of its most common allele presents a value below 0.99 (99%) a certain structural genetic locus is defined as polymorphic when the frequency of its most common allele presents a value below 0.99 (99%) the genetic relationship between the S. aureus strains could be explained using Nei's distance dij 25 and a UPGMA dendrogram 3. a high degree of genetic polymorphism (0.000dij0.184) was found among the clinical isolates. taxon A contained a larger number of isolates, strains or bacterial clusters. these results reinforce the hypothesis that S. aureus is dispersed in clinical microenvironments following both monoclonal and polyclonal patterns during a certain period and/or re-emerging temporarily. however, these data also suggest the possibility of microevolutionary processes in S. aureus populations, as demonstrated in each cluster. investigators have observed an increase in the amount of microorganisms during clinical procedures. Streptococcus viridans and Staphylococcus spp. are the most prevalent microorganisms found on the surfaces of dental equipment 1, 12, 20. high-speed drills and cavitrons generate aerosols and droplets that are contaminated with blood and bacteria. the highest concentration of S. aureus was found in the noses and on the tongues of children and among the dental students. at the end of dental treatment, S. aureus colonies isolated from the gloved hands decreased significantly. the most contaminated areas were the auxiliary table and the storeroom. the presence of microorganisms on dental impressions and gypsum casts was analyzed. only 54% of general dentists had a cross-infection policy in their dental clinics. only 30% to 40% were aware of the possible persistence of MRSA or P. aeruginosa. molecular-based epidemiological studies are useful in identifying possible sources of the spread of microorganisms in dental hospitals and clinical settings. this study points to the need for containment barriers, use of personal protective equipment, periodic identification and treatment of carriers among clinical staff, and installation of air purifiers."}
