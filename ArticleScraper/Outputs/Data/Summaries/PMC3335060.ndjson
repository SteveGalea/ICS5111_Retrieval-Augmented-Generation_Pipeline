{"summary": "a virus-like-particle vaccine in mice induced protection against infection. challenged animals exhibited an immunopathologic-type lung disease. results All vaccines induced serum neutralizing antibody with increasing dosages. more than 8000 cases, including almost 800 deaths, were reported during the outbreak period [4] since 2003, only sporadic cases have been reported; however, the possibility that SARS outbreaks could reemerge naturally or be deliberately released is a public health concern. an early concern for application of a SARS-CoV vaccine was the experience with other coronavirus infections which induced enhanced disease and immunopathology in animals. animals given an alum adjuvanted SARS vaccine and subsequently challenged with SARS-CoV showed an immunopathologic lung reaction reminiscent of that described for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in infants and in animal models given RSV vaccine and challenged naturally (infants) with RSV. Vaccines Four different SARS-CoV vaccines were evaluated in these studies. one was prepared in vero tissue cultures, zonal centrifuged for purification, and double-inactivated with formalin and UV irradiation. the other whole virus vaccine was prepared in vero cells, concentrated, purified, inactivated with beta propiolactone and packaged with alum adjuvant (BPV) g 6 DIV/0.5 g + alum SV/9 g + alum DIV/1 g + alum 7 DIV/0.25 g + alum SV/3 g + alum BPV/undil + alum 8 DIV/0.125 g + alum PBS-PBS 9 SV/2 g2 DIV/1 g PBS 10 SV/1 g DIV/0.25 g (50 l) each inactivated whole virus SV/dosage = Vaccine VLP = Virus-like particles containing SARS-CoV S glycoprotein and E, M, and N proteins from mouse hepatitis coronavirus BPV/dosage = Vaccine BPV = Purified beta propiolactone inactivated whole virus plus alum. five mice from each group were sacrificed for assessing serum neutralizing antibody titers and lung histopathology. challenged mice were euthanized for determining virus quantity and preparing lung tissue sections for histopathology. Lung lobes were placed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for virus quantitation. the remaining tissue specimen was weighed and frozen to 80\u00b0C. titers of virus in lung homogenates were expressed as TCID50/g of lung (log10) a working stock of the seed virus was prepared by serially passaging a portion of the seed virus three times (p3) in vero E6 cultures. the culture fluid from infected cells was clarified by low-speed centrifugation, filtered through a 0.45 m filter, aliquoted, and stored at 80\u00b0C. Vaccines Four different SARS-CoV vaccines were evaluated in these studies. g Live virus 4 DIV/0.125 g SV/3 g Flu vaccine 5 DIV/1 g + alum SV/1 g 6 DIV/0.5 g + alum SV/9 g + alum DIV/1 g + alum 7 DIV/0.25 g + alum BPV/undil + alum 8 DIV/0.125 g + alum PBS-PBS 9 SV/2 g2 DIV/1 2 DIV/dosage = Vaccine DIV = Zonal centrifuge purified doubly inactivated whole virus SV/dosage = Vaccine VLP = Virus-like particles containing SARS-CoV S glycoprotein and E, M, and N proteins from mouse hepatitis coronavirus BPV/dosage = Vaccine VLP = Vaccine VLP = Virus-like particles containing SARS-CoV S glycoprotein five mice from each group were sacrificed for assessing serum neutralizing antibody titers and lung histopathology. the remaining seven or eight mice in each group were challenged with 106TCID50/60 l of SARS-CoV intranasally. mice were euthanized and their lungs were removed. titers of virus in lung homogenates were expressed as TCID50/g of lung (log10) adjuvanted vaccine and mice that had been vaccinated with a VLP vaccine. the primary orientation was to assess for immunopathology in relation to type of vaccine, dosage, serum antibody responses, and virus infection. three vaccine preparations were simultaneously evaluated, the double-inactivated whole virus vaccine (DIV), the rDNA-expressed S protein vaccine (SV) and the previously evaluated chimeric viral-like particle vaccine (VLP) Vaccine comparisons of three SARS-CoV Vaccines, Experiment 1. Vaccine Comparisons of three SARS-CoV Vaccines, Experiment 1. Serum neutralizing (neut) antibody and lung virus titers for each vaccine dosage group. seven to eight mice per group were given 0.1 ml of vaccine intramuscularly. all vaccine groups exhibited lower titers or no detectable virus on day two after challenge. none of the animals given any of the alum-adjuvanted DI vaccine (DIV) dosages and only an occasional animal in the lower doses of nonadjuvanted vaccine yielded virus. the group given the DI vaccine without alum had higher mean scores than those given the DI vaccine with alum (p = 0.001, Mann-Whitney U); the group given the VLP vaccine without alum had a higher mean score than those given the VLP vaccine with alum (p = 0.008, Mann-Whitney U). s on histologic evaluation for seven to eight mice in each vaccine dosage group is the mean percent eosinophils on five separate microscopy fields of lung sections. DIV without alum greater than with alum p =.001, VLP without alum greater than with alum p =.008. cent eosinophils were lower in these vaccinated animals (mean 1\u20133.2%) than had been seen in animals given VLP vaccines in the earlier study. but no eosinophils were seen in the lung infiltrates of control animals in this experiment. the original propiolactone inactivated whole virus vaccine (SV) showed an immunopathologic-like reaction after challenge of vaccinated ferrets and nonhuman primates. a live virus group was added in this experiment for comparison of challenge results following vaccinations with inactivated vaccines to those following earlier infection. two days after challenge with 106 TCID50 of SARS-CoV, titers in mice varied between 107.0 and 108.0 TCID50 per g of tissue. one vaccinated animal in the group given the S protein vaccine (SV) at the 3 g and the 1 g dosage without alum yielded virus. vaccinated groups despite no detectable virus on day two. eosinophil scores were lower for SV than DIV p.001 and less than BPV p =.006. the mean eosinophil scores for the lung infiltrations were lower for the S protein vaccine groups. however, they were clearly greater than seen in those given live virus earlier. pathologic changes were extensive and similar in all challenged groups (H & E stains) morphological identification of eosinophils in H&E stains was supported by using Giemsa stain to highlight intracytoplasmic granules in selected lung sections. eosinophil-specific major basic protein (EOS MBP) stain column is on the left and eosinophil-specific major basic protein (EOS MBP) stain column is on the right. H&E and immunohistochemical stains for eosinophil major basic protein were performed as described for figure 5. sections from normal mice (no vaccine or live virus) and mice given PBS (no vaccine) or live SARS-CoV were then challenged with SARS-CoV. b/c mice than the C57BL/6 mice but only the nonadjuvanted DI vaccine group was significantly higher. the serum antibody responses after BPV and live virus administration were similar for the two mouse strains. eosinophil scores for the vaccine groups were not different between the two mouse strains (p>0.05, t test) both vaccines in both mouse strains showed significant cellular infiltrations that included numerous eosinophils. prior influenza vaccine did not lead to an eosinophil infiltration in the lung lesions after challenge. ten to 20 microscopy fields were scored for each mouse lung. scores are mean of scores for seven to eight mice per group. scores are mean of scores for seven to eight mice per group. the three experiments performed, vaccines and dosages used and controls for each experiment are shown in Table 1. the vaccines were evaluated for immunogenicity and efficacy; however, because of previous report of immunopathology on challenge of ferrets and nonhuman primates that had been vaccinated with a whole virus adjuvanted vaccine. postvaccination titers for the DI vaccine (DIV) were significantly increased by both alum and higher dosage (for alum, p = 0.012, for dosage, p 0.001) for the S protein vaccine (SV), only alum increased responses (p = 0.001) p =.012 and dosage p.001, for SV alum only p =.001, for all DIV groups not different p>.05, for SV group without alum p.008 and with alum p.023. two days after challenge, lungs were obtained from all animals for virus quantitation and histology. virus infection induced inflammatory infiltrates and epithelial cell necrosis. scores are mean (S.E.) for each vaccine dosage group. 0 \u2013 no pathology, 1 and 2 \u2013 (1) minimal (2) moderate peribronchiole and perivascular cellular infiltration, 3 and 4 \u2013 1 and/or 2 plus minimal (3) or moderate (4) epithelial cell necrosis of bronchioles with cell debris in the lumen. mean percent eosinophils on five separate microscopy fields of lung sections. eosinophils are a marker for a Th2-type hypersensitivity reaction. percent eosinophils was lower in these vaccinated animals (mean 1\u20133.2%) than had been seen in animals given VLP vaccines in the earlier study. experiment was conducted to verify the findings in the initial experiment of a hypersensitivity immunopathologic-like reaction after SARS-CoV challenge of vaccinated animals. a live virus \u201cvaccination\u201d group was added in this experiment for comparison of challenge results following vaccinations with inactivated vaccines to those following earlier infection. five mice per group given 0.1 ml of vaccine intramuscularly on days 0 and 28. five mice per group given 0.1 ml of vaccine intramuscularly on days 0 and 28. scores were significantly different from each other (p0.001, Anova) and lower for the S protein vaccine. those given live virus and challenged with live virus two months later showed an infiltrative disease severity comparable to the PBS and vaccinated groups. ten to 20 microscopy fields were scored for each mouse lung. mean eosinophil scores were lower for SV than DIV p.001. eosinophil scores greater for SV than PBS or live virus p.001. the morphological identification of eosinophils in H&E stains was supported by using Giemsa stain to highlight intracytoplasmic granules in selected lung sections. eosinophils are prominent (brown DAB staining) in all sections examined. eosinophils are prominent (brown DAB staining) in all sections examined. photomicrographs of lung tissue from unvaccinated unchallenged mice and from balb/c mice two days after challenge with SARS-CoV that had previously been given PBS only (no vaccine) or live virus. eosinophils in all groups remain within normal limits. titers for the highest dose of the DI vaccine were higher for those vaccine groups in the Balb/c mice than the C57BL/6 mice. the serum antibody responses after BPV and live virus administration were similar for the two mouse strains. double inactivated whole virus, (DIV), propiolactone inactivated whole virus (BPV), with alum (+A) p>.05.

DIV without alum greater than with alum p =.001, VLP without alum greater than with alum p =.008. SV lower than controls p.048. increased eosinophils are a marker for a Th2-type hypersensitivity reaction. eosinophils were lower in these vaccinated animals (mean 1\u20133.2%) than had been seen in animals given VLP vaccines in the earlier study. sensitivity immunopathologic-like reaction after challenge of vaccinated animals. bp inactivated vaccine (BPV) was only available at one dose with alum so a smaller volume (25 l) was given to one group for a dosage comparison. two days after challenge with 106 TCID50 of SARS-CoV, titers in mice varied between 107.0 and 108.0 TCID50 per g of tissue. one animal in the group given the S protein vaccine (SV) at the 3 g and the 1 g dosage without alum yielded virus but all other animals in all other groups were culture negative for virus. given live virus and then challenged with live virus two months later exhibited an infiltrative disease severity comparable to the PBS and vaccinated groups. no detectable virus on day two, again suggesting some degree of infection may have occurred earlier. sinophil scores were lower for SV than DIV p.001 and less than BPV p.001. the mean eosinophil scores for the lung infiltrations were lower for the S protein vaccine groups. but they were clearly greater than seen in those given live virus earlier. morphological identification of eosinophils in H&E stains was supported by using Giemsa stain to highlight intracytoplasmic granules in selected lung sections. the morphological identification of eosinophils in H&E stains was supported by using Giemsa stain to highlight intracytoplasmic granules in selected lung sections. ged mice (no vaccine or live virus) were challenged with SARS-CoV. eosinophils in all groups remain within normal limits. the different groups of vaccinated animals showed similar trends in severity of pathology. titers for highest dose of the DI vaccine were higher for those vaccine groups in the Balb/c mice than the C57BL/6 mice. the serum antibody responses after BPV and live virus administration were similar for the two mouse strains. none of the Balb/c mouse groups given either vaccine or live virus earlier yielded virus after challenge. the BPV vaccine and live virus were not different for the two strains p>.05. GMT for DIV without alum and BPV with alum greater for C57BL/6 than Balb/c p =.004. eosinophil scores were significantly different between groups (p0.001, Anova) with significantly lower scores for nonvaccine groups than for vaccine groups of both mice. cellular infiltration, 2 - moderate peribronchiole and perivascular cellular infiltration, 3 - severe peribronchiole and perivascular cellular infiltration. thickening of alveolar walls, alveolar infiltration and bronchiole epithelial cell necrosis and debris in the lumen. scores are mean of scores for seven to eight mice per group. emergence of the disease SARS and rapid identification of its severity and high risk for death prompted rapid mobilization for control. a concern for reemergence naturally or deliberate release supported continuation of a vaccine development effort so as to have the knowledge and capability necessary for preparing and using an effective vaccine. this type of tissue response is associated with an increase in type 2 cytokines including IL4, IL5 and IL13 and an influx of eosinophils into the infected lung. recent studies indicate that the Th2-type immune response has both innate and adaptive immune response components. concern for safety of administering SARS-CoV vaccines to humans became an early concern in vaccine development. virus vaccine was seen by us after challenge of mice vaccinated with a SARS VLP vaccine [20]. this finding was duplicated in an experiment reported here and was also seen in mice vaccinated with a range of dosages of a double-inactivated whole virus vaccine (DIV) and an rDNA S protein vaccine (SV). the immunopathology in all experiments in the present study occurred in the absence of detectable virus in lungs of mice two days after challenge with infectious virus vaccinia was used as a vector vaccine for immunizing balb/c mice with each of the SARS-CoV structural proteins (N, S, membrane, and envelope) eosinophilic infiltrates and IL-5 were increased in the N vaccine group but only IL-5 was increased in the S vaccine group. alum was used as an adjuvant and this adjuvant is known to promote a Th2 type bias to immune responses. alum was used as an adjuvant and this adjuvant is known to promote a Th2 type bias to immune responses. alum was used as an adjuvant and this adjuvant is known to promote a bias to immune responses. the authors indicate no lung immunopathology was seen among animals after challenge. however, whether the hamster model could develop a Th2-type immunopathology is uncertain. a number of other studies of vaccines in animal models have been reported. animal model Vaccine1 Protection2 Immunopathology3 Mice Whole virustr w alum Yes Yes Whole virus25,tr w alum Yes Yes wo alum Yes Yes VEE Vector15 for N protein No Yes for S protein Yes \"No Ferrets Whole virus11 w alum Yes Nonhuman Primate4 Whole virus11 w alum Yes Yes Hamsters Whole virus22 w ASO1 Yes No 1 Reference for each indicated; tr = this report this concern emanates from the proposal that the N protein may be the dominant antigen provoking the immunopathologic reaction. similarity to the SARS-CoV vaccine evaluations in mice supports caution for clinical vaccine trials with SARS-CoV vaccines in humans. a successful study with a Th1-type adjuvant that did not exhibit the Th2 pathology after challenge would have confirmed a Th2 bias to immune responses."}
