{"summary": "TEXT The 2002-2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus was a significant public health threat at the beginning of the 21st century (1). initial evidences showed that the masked palm civet (Paguma larvata) was the primary suspect in the animal origin of SARS-CoV (2, 3) later studies suggested that Chinese horseshoe bats are natural reservoirs and that the masked palm civet most likely served as an intermediate amplification the full genomic sequence of SL-CoV WIV16 (GenBank accession number KT444582) was determined and contained 30,290 nucleotides (nt) and a poly(A) tail which is slightly larger than those of SARS-CoVs and other bat SL-CoVs (6, 8\u201313) the WIV16 genome has a 40.9% G+C content and short untranslated regions (UTRs) of 264 and 339 nt at the identity SZ3 WIV16 WIV1 Rs3367 RsSHC014 Rs672 Rp3 Rf1 Rm1 LYRa11 HKU3-1 YNLF_31C BM48-31 FL 99.8 96.0 95.6 95.7 95.4 93.4 92.6 87.8 88.2 90.9 87.9 93.5 78.8 P1a 13,134 4,377 99.9/99.9 96.6/98.1 96.9/9 99.3 98.3/99.5 88.0/95.5 88.4/96.2 85.5/92.7 88.3/96.0 87.3/96.3 85.9/93.9 86.0/93.7 76.7/89.6 ORF3a 825 274 99.0/97.8 99.2/98.2 99.0/97.8 99.2/98.2 99.0/97.8 99.2/98.2 99.0/97.8 99.2/98 SL-CoV WIV16, WIV1, Rs3367, and RsSHC014 were identified from Rhinolophus sinicus collected in Yunnan, China, during 2011 to 2013. SARS-CoV GZ02 was isolated from patients in the early phase of the SARS outbreak in 2003. full-length genome; S1, the N-terminal domain of the S protein (aa 1 to 680); S2, the C-terminal domain of the S protein (aa 681 to 1255); NA, not available. a pairwise comparison was conducted for all ORFs at nucleotide and amino acid levels. the WIV16 RBD (amino acids [aa] 318 to 510) has 95% sequence identity to the SARS-CoV RBD. thus, the WIV16 S gene is likely a recombinant of WIV1's gene and a recent ancestor of SARS-CoV's gene. nuclei were stained with rabbit antibody against the SL-CoV Rp3 nucleocapsid protein. cyanine 3 (Cy3)-conjugated mouse anti-rabbit IgG. the columns show staining of nuclei (blue), virus replication (red) and both nuclei and virus replication (merged triple-stain images) we isolated and characterized a novel bat SL-CoV isolate, WIV16, which is the closest ancestor to date of the SARS-CoV. full-length ORF8 is present in several SARS-CoV genomes of early-phase patients, all civet SARS-CoVs, and bat SL-CoVs. full genomic sequence of SL-CoV WIV16 was deposited in GenBank under accession number KT444582. nucleotide sequence accession number."}
