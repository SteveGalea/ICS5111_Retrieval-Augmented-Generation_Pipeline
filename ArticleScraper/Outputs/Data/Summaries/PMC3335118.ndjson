{"summary": "NGOs such as the ETC Group and headlines announcing the creation of artificial life have increasingly brought policy attention to bear on synthetic biology [13]. in April of 2012 the Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTTA) will consider the potential implications of synthetic biology as a new and emerging issue. the data in this article is available as an interactive Tableau workbook in Workbook S1 for use with free Tableau Reader software and online through the Synthetic Biology Scientific Landscape Tableau Public workbook (Legends S1) Methods In approaching a new and emerging area of science and technology a variety of search strategies may be used with Thomson Reuters or other publication databases. the choices made in the development of search strategies may be used with Thomson Reuters or other publication databases. search strategy focusing on \u201csynthetic biology\u201d, \u201csynthetic genomics\u201d, \u201csynthetic genome\u201d and \u201csynthetic genomes\u201d was used to capture the core landscape. other important contributions to the field are captured through analysis of cited literature and exploration of the landscape of researchers citing work in synthetic biology within their publications. a significant proportion of the literature takes the form of review articles with a provisional total of 62 review articles against 207 articles in 2011. a significant proportion of the literature takes the form of review articles with a provisional total of 62 review articles against 207 articles in 2011. this profile of review against research articles suggests an emerging field. synthetic biology is an extension of synthetic chemistry leading to the development of novel molecules and advancing research on the origin of life. for engineers biology is classified as a \u2018technology\u2019 that requires \u201cthe development of foundational technologies that make the design and construction of engineered biological systems easier\u201d a total of 36,262 individual words and phrases from the titles, abstracts and author key words of publications were available for analysis from our dataset of 1,255 publications. these terms were then reduced to 24,023 multi-word phrases and composite terms (i.e. biotechnology, bionanotechnology) to focus on meaningful concepts and categories. this method revealed that 356 terms capture 99% of records on synthetic biology. figure 3 narrows the focus to the top ranking phrases and composite terms in more than 20 records across the dataset. synthetic biology is strongly associated with systems biology, protein engineering, genetic engineering and nanotechnology. but synthetic biology would immediately be swamped by the results from these much larger fields. synthetic biology emerges as a research mobilisation around the term \u201csynthetic biology\u201d and, to a lesser extent, \u201csynthetic genomics\u201d that draws on methods, techniques and technologies from a wider range of established and emergent research areas. this is a rallying flag around which researchers are articulating themselves focusing on genetic circuits, networks, pathways and parts. the figure ranks countries on the number of authors from a country appearing in publications in Web of Science linked to geocoded organizational information on their global distribution. country rankings are base on data for 1160 records of 1255 records. this data can be explored in Workbook S1. network mapping in Gephi using modularity class algorithm revealed 527 distinct research clusters or modules that make up the primary human resources for synthetic biology. ranked authors purely by the number of publications revealed the leading authors to be Fussenegger [49], Benner [25], Keasling [50], Weber [51], Chen [52], Collins [24], Silver [54], Stano [55] and Zhang [56]. data can be explored for all authors with five or more citations in the core landscape. data is accessible in Workbook S1 and online through the Synthetic Biology Scientific Landscape. the data does not refer to total citations for an author or article within the wider scientific literature. this data can be explored in Workbook S1 and online through the Synthetic Biology Scientific Landscape. the citing literature reveals an expanded landscape involving 78 countries, approximately 3,000 organizations. research by Dunn focusing on metabolomics and mass spectrometry provides a reminder of the importance of methodological development [74], [75]. citing landscape is diffuse and characterised by low frequency terms relative to the size of the landscape. citing landscape encompasses researchers from 78 countries. the core of synthetic biology is strongly situated in Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, followed by Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology and the interdisciplinary Science & Technology category. in the citing landscape these categories are reinforced and shift in importance notably through influence of synthetic biology in chemistry. the impacts of synthetic biology are also observed in the emergence of publications in Virology, Environmental Sciences and Ecology. 530 funding organizations have supported research appearing in 3 or more publications within Web of Science on synthetic biology. figure 10 provides a visualisation of the network of relations between funding organizations appearing in 5 or more publications within Web of Science. the US Department of Energy has been funding research on biofuels [91], [99] along with work on a synchronized genetic clock for engineering genetic circuits [100] and whole genome engineering [39]. the United States Department of Defense, through the DARPA, the Office of Naval Research, the Air Force and the Army, emerges as an important co-funder of research with other agencies in areas such as bacterial quorum sensing. data by funding organization can be explored in Workbook S1 and online through the Synthetic Biology Scientific Landscape. this type of information is rarely made visible and funding networks may not be visible to the agencies engaged in supporting research. this data is unlikely to fully or adequately reflect private sector involvement. a significant proportion of literature takes form of review articles with a provisional total of 62 review articles against 207 articles in 2011. the first class focus on assembling non-natural or synthetic components to create chemical systems that support Darwinian or biological evolution. the second class focus on understanding \u2018natural\u2019 biology while the latter focuses on engineering. synthetic biology is an extension of synthetic chemistry leading to the development of novel molecules and advancing research on the origin of life. for engineers biology is classified as a \u2018technology\u2019 that requires \u201cthe development of foundational technologies that make the design and construction of engineered biological systems easier\u201d. this method revealed that 356 terms capture 99% of records on synthetic biology. the top unifying term is synthetic biology. when synthetic biology was excluded the remaining 355 terms captured 88% of records providing sufficient accuracy for representation of the data. a Fruchterman-Reingold representation in Gephi of the top aggregated terms for synthetic biology within Web of Science based on titles, abstracts and author keywords appearing in more than 20 or more records following stemming. this approach revealed the prominence of relations between genetic circuits, gene networks, synthetic genes, synthetic systems and gene regulatory networks. synthetic biology is a rallying flag around which researchers are articulating themselves focusing on genetic circuits, networks, pathways and parts. it draws on techniques from systems biology, metabolic engineering, protein engineering and genetic engineering but cannot simply be reduced to these fields. impacts of synthetic biology are being disseminated and picked up in multiple other fields. network mapping reveals the prominence of the university of California at Berkeley, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH), Harvard and MIT. the data does not discriminate by discipline with the social sciences represented in work at Berkeley, Exeter and Edinburgh. the details of the network come into greater focus in Figure 7 that ranks all authors with 5 or more publications within the data. this data includes one social scientist [46] to capture the wider network of those working on and writing about synthetic biology. cited references are only available in raw form i.e. Elowitz MB, 2000, NATURE, V403, P335. this is compounded by a requirement to retrieve cited references individually. the citing literature reveals an expanded landscape involving 78 countries, approximately 3,000 organizations, and an estimated 19,751 researchers. in total 1,153 of the 2,934 researchers working on synthetic biology are present in this landscape and dominate the publication rankings. the citing landscape encompasses researchers from 78 countries. it is also important as an indicator of knowledge transfer between countries. the citing landscape encompasses researchers from 78 countries. data on journal subject categories for the citing landscape can be explored in Workbook S1 and online through the Synthetic Biology Scientific Landscape. future work in exploring the emerging scientific landscape for synthetic biology could build upon recent efforts to map the structure of the scientific literature. large nodes such as the US National Science Foundation may display intersections with unrelated edges. funding is dominated by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) in the united states and the European Union Framework programme. the NIH has funded notable research on synthetic gene oscillators [87], an ER mitochondria screening tethering complex using a synthetic biology screen [88], work on synthetic genetic networks [89] and development of the proposed second wave of synthetic biology in moving from funding by the Swiss National Science Foundation appears to be more targeted towards biopharmaceutical applications and work relating to mammals [36], [51], [102]\u2013[104]. research funders may begin to focus on distinctive emerging flavours of synthetic biology. a fuller picture will be generated by ongoing work to map the patent landscape. the predominance of organizations funded by taxpayers within the scientific literature provides important levers for policy makers under the Convention on Biological Diversity. discussions 193 governments are parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity. international rules and procedures on liability and redress relating to living modified organisms. this protocol establishes international rules and procedures on liability and redress. rules also address damage arising from authorized use of LMOs and unintentional and illegal transboundary movements. synthetic biology is relevant to the third objective of the Convention on access to genetic resources and benefit sharing and the recently concluded Nagoya Protocol on access to genetic resources and benefit sharing. concerns have been expressed regarding the use of artemisinin and the increasing ease with which genetic material can be transformed into digital information, transmitted, reproduced and manipulated. a number of civil society organizations have made individual and joint submissions on this topic. the key recommendation by the International Civil Society Working Group on Synthetic Biology (ICSWGSB) is that countries should conduct impact assessments for proposed synthetic biology projects. if adopted these recommendations would have serious implications for the conduct of scientific research in synthetic biology. the question of a potential moratorium on synthetic biology as a field was considered as part of the 2010 United States Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues report on synthetic biology. the Commission found no reason to endorse additional federal regulations or a moratorium on work in this field at this time. in arriving at this conclusion the Commission sought to find a middle ground between a moratorium on synthetic biology pending assessment of all risks and \"unfettered freedom for scientific exploration\" a number of choices will be available to SBSTTA and Parties to the Convention. it would be open to SBSTTA to include a recommendation to establish a technical expert group to consider the available evidence. a moratorium on the release of synthetic organisms and components would have major implications for future research in synthetic biology across the spectrum of research areas. Parties could invite funding organizations to ensure that research they fund is supportive of, and does not run counter to the objectives of the Convention. such an invitation would serve to promote greater awareness of the Convention among public funding bodies and private foundations that recognise the importance of international commitments on the environment. if a moratorium is introduced on field release opportunities should be provided for periodic review of biocontainment and control measures to encourage further development in this area. the core contribution of this article has been to promote the development of longer term monitoring capacity. this community has demonstrated a considerable willingness to engage with civil society and policy and to consider appropriate measures for governance. however, at this early stage in the development of this field proposals regarding biocontainment and control remain under developed."}
