{"summary": "a pool of NSP4 colocalizes with the autophagy marker protein LC3. the requirement for or role that autophagy might play during rotavirus replication was unknown. the pharmacological inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) inhibits Vps34. inhibition of autophagy reduces yield of rotavirus. MA104 cells were treated with 0, 10, or 25 mM 3-MA for 3 h before rotavirus infection (moi) 1. cells and media were harvested at the indicated times. atg5+/+, Atg5/, or Atg5/ cells transfected with plasmids expressing WT Atg5-EGFP (WT) or Atg5-EGFP K130R were infected with rotavirus and harvested 18 hpi. the lysates were analyzed by Western blot using antibodies against LC3 and GAPDH. atg5/ cells increased production of infectious rotavirus. the cellular autophagy machinery is required for infectious rotavirus production. rotavirus infection induces LC3 Lipidation and NSP4/LC3 Puncta Formation. confocal microscopy was used to visualize the location of LC3, NSP4 and NSP5 (a component of viroplasms) in rotavirus-infected cells at various time points postinfection. at 4 hpi, small NSP4 puncta were observed, and most of these NSP4 puncta colocalized with endogenous LC3. rotavirus-infected MA104 cells were fixed; permeabilized at 3 (A), 4 (B), 5 (C) and 6 (D) hpi. antibody against NSP5 detected viroplasms (blue), endogenous LC3 (green), or NSP4 (red). rotavirus initiates autophagy maturation. the expression level of NSP4 was similar in the presence or absence of bafilomycin A1. these results suggest rotavirus infection both induces LC3 II lipidation and LC3 puncta formation. a tandem-tagged monomeric (m)RFP-GFP-LC3 probe was used to detect autolysosomes. mRFP-GFP-LC3 probe can detect whether an autophagosome has fused with a lysosome. the low pH inside an autolysosome quenches GFP, and only the fluorescent signal is detected. induction of autophagy is complex and can occur through multiple signaling pathways. rotavirus infection suppresses autophagy maturation. rotavirus infection suppresses autophagy maturation. MA104 cells were transfected with WT NSP4-EGFP (Top) or NSP4-ASDASA-EGFP (Middle and Bottom) at 24 hpi, the cells were fixed, stained with antibody against LC3 and imaged by confocal microscopy. the number of cells containing only NSP4 puncta (white bars) or puncta that colocalize (black bars) were quantitated. the mutant was previously shown to form puncta following elevation of [Ca2+]cyto by the sarcoplasmic/ER Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) inhibitor thapsigargin (TG) (23). LC3/NSP4 puncta were observed in 77% of TG-treated NSP4-ASDASA-EGFP\u2013expressing cells (n = 79 cells; Fig. 5 A, Bottom, and B; P 0.001, Fisher\u2019s exact test) elevated [Ca2+]cyto induces autophagy and is required for formation of NSP4/LC3 puncta. a similar increase in [Ca2+]cyto was observed in cells expressing NSP4 either in the absence or presence of STO-609 as. rotavirus-infected cells were cultured in the absence or presence of STO-609. LC3 II was detected in rotavirus-infected cells cultured in the absence of STO-609. a similar level of NSP4 expression was observed in rotavirus-infected cells. cell lysates were harvested 6 hpi and analyzed by Western blot to detect LC3, and NSP4 as well as GAPDH as a loading control. quantification of LC3 II/LC3 I ratios and NSP4 normalized to GAPDH is shown below the respective blots. MA104 cells were transfected with a scrambled (Scr) siRNA or siRNA against gene 10, which encodes NSP4 (G10), and infected with rotavirus 72 h post transfection. the LC3 II/LC3 ratio detected in NSP4-specific siRNA-transfected cells was similar to that in mock-infected cells. rotavirus, specifically the NSP4-viroporin\u2013mediated increase in [Ca2+]cyto, activates CaMKK-\u2013AMPK signaling to induce autophagy. chelating calcium or inhibiting CaMKK- suppresses rotavirus-mediated induction of autophagy and virus replication. in transfected but not rotavirus-infected cells, NSP4-ASDASA-EGFP was reticular. but in rotavirus-infected cells in which viral-encoded NSP4 increased [Ca2+]cyto, NSP4-ASDASA-EGFP puncta formed and surrounded viroplasms. this result indicates that the viral-encoded NSP4 increase in [Ca2+]cyto is responsible for trafficking the a pool of NSP4 colocalizes with the autophagy marker protein LC3 and surrounds viroplasms, sites of virus replication. the requirement for or role that autophagy might play during rotavirus replication was unknown. Akt and NF-B are required for efficient synthesis of viral proteins and cell survival following rotavirus infection. infectivity assays were performed in cells genetically deficient in proteins required for autophagy membrane formation. infectivity assays were performed in cells genetically deficient in proteins required for autophagy membrane formation. rotavirus infection of Atg5+/+ MEFs or Atg5/ MEFs transfected with plasmids expressing WT Atg5-EGFP (WT) induces LC3 II. atg5+/+, Atg5/, or Atg5/ cells transfected with the mutant Atg5-GFP K130R (light gray bars) (D) were infected with rotavirus (moi 10) and then harvested at the LC3 II was detected in rotavirus-infected parental and Atg5/ cells expressing WT Atg5-EGFP but not in Atg5/ cells or Atg5/ cells expressing Atg5-EGFP K130R. expression of WT Atg5-EGFP, but not the Atg5-EGFP K130R mutant, in Atg5/ cells increased production of infectious rotavirus. rotavirus (RV) infection leads to LC3 lipidation and insertion into autophagic membranes. proteins on the blots were detected with antibody against LC3. LC3 II forms puncta that can be visualized using immunofluorescence. rotavirus-infected MA104 cells were fixed; permeabilized at 3 (A), 4 (B), 5 (C) and 6 (D) hpi. rotavirus initiates autophagy process, compared with detection of LC3-positive puncta. basal LC3 II catabolism occurred in mock-infected cells cultured in DMEM based on minimal LC3 II detection. however, an increase in LC3 II was detected in rotavirus-infected cells cultured in the absence of bafilomycin A1 compared with infected cells cultured in the presence of bafilomycin A1. monomeric (m) RFP-GFP-LC3\u2013expressing rotavirus-infected MA104 cells were fixed at 20 hpi, stained with antirotavirus antibody (blue) both RFP and GFP fluorescence are observed in the same puncta in rotavirus-infected cells. rotavirus infection suppresses autophagosome maturation. Lysotracker probes are weakly basic amines that selectively accumulate in the low pH of lysosomes and autolysosomes. the NSP4/LC3/viroplasm puncta did not colocalize with the autolysosome marker protein LAMP1. rotavirus infection initiates the early stages of the autophagy process. if elevated [Ca2+]cyto triggered autophagy, NSP4/LC3 puncta would be observed following expression of either WT NSP4-EGFP or NSP4-ASDASA-EGFP. we observed NSP4/LC3 puncta in 90% of cells expressing WT NSP4-EGFP. MA104 cells were transfected with WT NSP4-EGFP and cultured in media (Vehicle), 50 M BAPTA-AM, or 50 M STO-609. at 24 hpi, the cells were fixed, stained with antibody against LC3. the number of cells containing only NSP4 puncta (white bars) or puncta containing both NSP4 and LC3 that colocalize (black bars) were quantitated. -tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester) (BAPTA-AM) was expressed in MA104 cells in the absence of 7-Oxo-7H-benzimidazo[2,1-a]benz[de]isoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid acetate. only 5% of the BAPTA-treated cells contained NSP4/LC3 puncta. SP4/LC3 puncta were observed in 90% of the WT NSP4-EGFP\u2013expressing cells (n = 21) whereas NSP4/LC3 puncta were observed in only 40% of STO-609\u2013treated WT NSP4-EGFP\u2013expressing cells (n = 34 cells; Fig. 5C and S2A, Lower; P = 0.0002, Fisher\u2019s exact test) rotavirus-infected cells cultured in the absence or presence of STO-609. only LC3 I was detected in rotavirus-infected cells cultured in the presence of STO-609. a similar level of NSP4 expression was observed in rotavirus-infected cells. the cells and media were harvested at the indicated times. the cells and media were assayed for infectious rotavirus by fluorescent focus assay. the cells and media were harvested at the indicated times. inhibiting autophagy using 3-MA or cells genetically deficient in proteins required for autophagy membrane formation reduced the yield of rotavirus. chelating [Ca2+]cyto by BAPTA-AM significantly reduced the yield of rotavirus. rotavirus activates CaMKK-\u2013AMPK signaling to induce autophagy. the outer capsid proteins (VP4 and VP7) then assemble onto the particle to form the mature, infectious particle. in rotavirus-infected cells, NSP4 mediates the early increase of [Ca2+]cyto. in transfected but not rotavirus-infected cells, NSP4-ASDASA-EGFP was reticular. in the absence of STO-609, NSP4 and VP7 surround viroplasms. confocal and infectivity assay results indicate rotavirus hijacks the autophagy trafficking pathway to transport the ER-associated viral proteins required for infectious particle assembly to viroplasms. viroporins are small, hydrophobic proteins that oligomerize to create a transmembrane aqueous pore. a virus hijacks the autophagy membrane trafficking pathway to transport viral proteins required for infectious particle assembly to sites of virus replication. the viroporin domain is responsible for the release of ER calcium into the cytoplasm. formation of endogenous LC3-containing autophagy-like membranes requires PI3K activity, as well as the autophagy-initiation proteins Atg3 and Atg5. by confocal microscopy, NSP4 and LC3 form small and later larger NSP4/LC3 puncta that eventually surround viroplasms. ovirus 3A protein disrupts microtubules, which inhibits autophagosome-like vesicle trafficking. however, poliovirus induces autophagosome-like vesicles that are decorated by lipidated LC3 and the lysosomal marker protein LAMP1. future studies will determine whether disruption of microtubules or another mechanism is responsible for the lack of fusion between the autophagosome-like puncta surrounding viro a number of viruses induce autophagy as well as increase [Ca2+]cyto. the mechanism(s) used by these viruses to induce autophagy is largely unknown. however, all encode one or more proteins that increase [Ca2+]cyto from ER or Golgi [Ca2+] stores. guinea pig hyperimmune serum prepared against NSP5 purified from Escherichia coli as previously described (49) was generated by Cocalico Biologicals, Inc. LC3 antibody was obtained from Novus, and GAPDH antibody was obtained from Chemicon. clone 3 gene 10 siRNA sequence, AAGCCACAGUCAGCCAUAUCG, or for Scr control, AAGCGGCCCUCCAAAGCCAAA, was transfected into MA104 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) (50). cells were infected 72 h after transfection with SA11 clone 3 rotavirus or were mock-infected. cells were stained with 0.4% trypan blue at room temperature for 5 min. Statistical differences between groups were determined using a two-tailed Student t test or Fisher\u2019s exact test. MA104 cells were transfected with the mRFP-GFP-LC3 plasmid (Addgene) or atg5/ cells were transfected with the plasmids (p) pEGFP-C1-mApg5 (WT Atg5-EGFP) expressing mouse WT Atg5 or with pEGFP-C1-mApg5 (K130R) expressing a mutant Atg5 (Addgene) (20 a subset of transfected cells was treated with 1 M TG for 3 h. all the cells were then fixed, permeabilized, and stained as described above. the majority of cells with either NSP4 alone or NSP4/LC3 puncta contained between 7 and 35 puncta."}
