{"summary": "multisectoral approaches under a One Health umbrella are more expedient and effective, and lead to efficient utilization of limited resources (4,5). multisectoral approaches under a One Health umbrella are more expedient and effective, and lead to efficient utilization of limited resources (4,5). multisectoral partnerships are easier to create if participants from multiple sectors develop a prioritized list of zoonotic diseases. the one health office at the centers for disease control and prevention (CDC) developed the one health zoonotic disease prioritization tool, a semiquantitative tool for prioritization with equal input from represented sectors. the tool has been used to select zoonotic diseases for further programmatic activity in multiple countries. the country\u2019s government ministries should select participants. in countries that have conducted prioritization workshops, CDC provided training to in-country workshop facilitators. estimating the burden of zoonotic diseases is a critical step in identifying public- and animal-health priorities. a rapid and effective response to endemic and emerging zoonotic diseases relies heavily on a timely and efficient surveillance and reporting system (13). surveillance in animals and humans is critical for early identification and possible prediction of future outbreaks, allowing for preemptive action. training epidemiologists and establishment of effective laboratory systems are critical for a successful zoonotic disease surveillance program. a requirement for ensuring testing quality is commitment from the top levels of management to provide the necessary resources to sustain the functional roles of the laboratory in an environment that supports quality and safety. all laboratory staff should be trained on these policies and procedures to ensure they are executed in consistent and reliable manner. countries should establish functional cross-sector coordination and communication pathways before an outbreak occurs. multisectoral collaboration is easier during an emergency if agencies had already been working together to address prioritized zoonotic diseases. early detection of an impending human outbreak may be achieved through detection of an increase in disease in animal populations, such as livestock and wildlife populations. disease outbreaks in animals may be the first signal to start implementation of prevention programs such as ring vaccination of animals. effective human and animal disease surveillance systems are critical for early detection and response. effective communication and collaboration between human and animal health agencies are essential to develop disease prevention and control strategies. prioritization of zoonotic diseases is challenging in resource-poor settings. multisectoral partnerships are easier to create if participants from multiple sectors develop a prioritized list of zoonotic diseases. one health office at the centers for disease control and prevention (CDC) developed the one health zoonotic disease prioritization tool. the country\u2019s government ministries should select participants. in countries that have conducted prioritization workshops, CDC provided training to in-country workshop facilitators to promote country ownership of the process. illance in animals and humans is critical for early identification and possible prediction of future outbreaks. training epidemiologists and establishment of effective laboratory systems are critical for a successful zoonotic disease surveillance program. an effective surveillance system may require standard case definitions for priority zoonotic diseases under surveillance. critical human and animal laboratory systems that countries need to establish or expand include central and regional laboratory capacity; specimen referral systems for rapid, safe, and reliable specimen transport; laboratory training programs that promote workforce development and retention. a successful zoonotic disease outbreak response requires the ability to detect the outbreak using established surveillance systems including event-based reporting. countries should establish functional cross-sectoral coordination and communication pathways before an outbreak occurs. multisectoral collaboration is easier during an emergency if agencies had already been working together to address prioritized zoonotic diseases. early detection of an impending human outbreak may in some instances be achieved through detection of an increase in disease in animal populations. prevention and control may involve large-scale culling and effective biosecurity programs. for diseases such as anthrax and rabies, preemptive vaccination of animals will prevent outbreaks in the animal population while at. the same time protecting humans. the development and implementation of cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit models will ensure effective use of resources. evaluations may include the negative effects culling has on societal well-being and livelihood of farmers. effective zoonotic disease prevention, detection, and response requires close collaboration. in some countries, formal, national collaborative One Health coordinating mechanisms were established to facilitate multisectoral engagement. examples include the Zoonotic Disease Unit in Kenya, the Zoonotic Disease Secretariat in Cameroon, and the Guidelines for Coordinated Prevention and Control of Zoonotic Diseases in Vietnam (17)."}
