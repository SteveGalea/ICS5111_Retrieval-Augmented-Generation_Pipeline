Myocardial hypertrophy is usually considered as a compensatory response to pathological conditions [64] APS can exert its anti-hypertrophic action via inhibiting Ca2+-mediated calcineurin/NFATc3 and CaMKII signaling cascades in isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy rats. SR plays an important role in the regulation of intracellular calcium. the authors found that AS-IV can activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR) to stimulate fatty acid -oxidation and increase cardiac energy production. the pathological characteristics of cardiac fibrosis are an infinite proliferation of fibroblasts and excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins in the myocardium [74] AS-IV has been demonstrated to possess remarkable antifibrotic effects via its antioxidative activity. it was reported that AS-IV may inhibit isoproterenol-induced cardiac fibrosis by suppressing ROS-mediated MAPK activation. excessive ROS can promote the production of cardiotrophin-1. the effects of the AR extracts and their main compounds on mitochondrial bioenergetics were evaluated. the results showed that AR water extract inhibited the ROS production and possessed the strongest antioxidant activity. this protection was proposed to be mediated by increasing the spare respiratory capacity and mitochondrial ATP production in the stressed cells. the different signaling pathways regulated by AR and its components are numbered 1 to 2.

APS could activate the AMPK signaling pathway to promote GLUT4. it could also activate the insulin signaling pathway to promote GLUT4 from intracellular vesicles to cell membranes. also, it was observed that the AR water extract could prevent the development of diabetes. endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an organelle responsible for regulating the synthesis of membrane proteins and regulating secretory organs. pathological stress state can disturb the homeostasis of ER, leading to unfolded and misfolded ER lumen and ER stress response. microRNAs play a vital role in regulating the expression of insulin secretion-related proteins. diabetic cardiomyopathy is characterized by an imbalance between myocyte death and regeneration mediated by the progressive loss of cardiac stem and progenitor cells. APS could increase the CSPCs abundance by the inhibition of oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis in diabetic hearts of streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice. inhibiting oxidative stress is believed to be an important strategy for the therapy of diabetic cardiomyopathy. previous studies revealed that the neuregulin-1 pathway is impaired in diabetic cardiomyopathy cells. APS could increase proliferation and inhibit apoptosis. NF-B is bound with an inhibitory protein of nuclear factor-B (IB) to form as an inactive transcription factor in the cytoplasm. APS was proven to inhibit the expression of inflammatory factors and alleviate diabetic nephropathy by inhibiting the NF-B signaling pathway in streptozotocin-induced diabetic nephropathy rats. growing evidence suggests that the Wnt/-catenin pathway and the TGF-1/Smads pathway are closely linked to the process of cell injury. overexpression of miR-21 activated the -catenin pathway and the TGF-1/Smads pathway and promote renal injury and fibrosis. AS-IV could also improve renal function and fibrosis in diabetic KK-Ay mice. formononetin could inhibit the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway to induce the apoptosis of cervical cancer HeLa cells and suppress xenograft tumor growth in nude mice. formononetin could be used as an anti-cancer drug for cervical cancer in the future [120] formononetin may be a potential chemopreventive drug for therapy lung cancer and prostate cancer. it is well known that ROS takes part in a variety of cellular activities. low ROS concentration can promote cell survival, while excessive ROS production easily causes DNA damage and induce cell apoptosis. epithelial-mesenchymal transition exerts an important role in regulating the chemoresistance properties of glioma. the histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5) has been shown to play a critical role in cell proliferation, cell cycle progression and apoptosis. it could promote glioma cells proliferation and might provide novel therapeutic targets in the treatment of gliomas.

AS-IV could attenuate allergic inflammation by regulation Th1/Th2 cytokine and enhancement CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells in ovalbumin-induced asthma [155] it was observed that AS-IV could significantly ameliorate airway inflammation by inhibiting the mTORC1 signaling pathway in an established model of asthma [158] APS could effectively inhibit asthma by inhibiting ER stress. increasing evidence suggests that EMT plays a critical role in pulmonary fibrosis. anti-EMT pathway or the method of inhibiting of TGF-1 signaling could provide a novel potential target for the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis. epidermal growth factor-like domain 7 (EGFL7) is secreted by endothelial cells. it is widely distributed in lung, heart and spleen, plays an important role in angiogenesis. APS could exert protective effects in newborn rats with bronchopulmonary dysplasia by upregulating the expression of EGFL7 in lung tissue [169] pharmacological intervention to preserve mitochondrial HK-II is shown to protect mitochondrial function and reduce apoptosis in the ischemic brain. AS-IV could protect the integrity of mitochondrial function, inhibit the expression of apoptosis-related proteins and protect the ischemic brain tissue damage. the p38MAPK signaling pathway plays a vital role as transducers of extracellular stimuli into a series of intracellular phosphorylation cascades. ERK, as one of the major MAPK subfamilies, can be activated by inflammatory cytokines and extracellular stressors. a high-throughput comparative proteomic approach based on 2D-nano-LC-MS/MS to investigate the possible mechanism of action involved in the neuroprotect in could prevent the decrease in activity of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and depletion of GSH in glutamate-damaged PC12 cells. these compounds could also protect the integrity of membrane structure and inhibit nerve injury by inhibiting the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) APS could attenuate MPTP-induced motor dysfunction, increase the proportion of TH-positive cells, reverse MPTP-induced mitochondrial structural damage and reduce MPTP-induced high levels of ROS.

Myocardial hypertrophy can lead to myocardial inflammation, myocardial metabolic disorders, abnormal energy production of myocardial cells, myocardial ischemia and hypoxia, heart failure and sudden death. urin and promote the nuclear factor of activated T cells cytoplasmic 3 (NFATc3) transcription factor into the nucleus, then activate calmodulin II kinase (CaMKII) and promote the expression of cardiac hypertrophy indicators. APS could alleviate the increase of intracellular free calcium during cardiac hypertrophy induced by isoproterenol. cardiac fibrosis is an infinite proliferation of fibroblasts and excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins in the myocardium. AS-IV could inhibit transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily M, member 7 (TRPM7), decrease intracellular calcium, decrease the -smooth muscle actin (-SMA), inhibit fibroblasts differentiation into fibroblasts and inhibit expression of ECM and collagen I. AS-IV was able to effectively inhibit isoproterenol-induced cardiac fibroblast proliferation and collagen production through negative regulation of ROS-mediated CT-1 upregulation. the vasoreactivity of the endothelial-dependent coronary artery is a key indicator of vascular function. it is well known that NO plays an important role in physiological and pathological endothelial cells function. metalloproteinases are closely related to hyperhomocysteinemia induced cardiovascular disease. total extract of AR and Astragalus saponins (ASP) could increase the production of NO in abnormal aorta, increase the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and decrease the concentration of metalloproteinases MMP-2 and MMP-9, thereby improving vascular endothelial dysfunction. T lymphocyte (T cell) mediated immune response plays an important role in the pathogenesis of T1DM. the main functional subgroups of T cell include CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells. under normal physiological conditions, CD4 + T cells maintain a dynamic balance of CD4 +/CD8 + and keep a normal immune response in the body. APS could up-regulate expression of galectin-1 in muscle of streptozotocin-induced T1DM mice, resulting in the apoptosis of CD8 + T cells. APS could protect cells of the pancreatic islets from apoptosis induced by CD8 + T cells in T1DM in vivo. the regulation of the IRS1-PI3K-GLUT signaling pathway by AR water extract could significantly improve diabetic nephropathy [10]. it has been revealed that the activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway can produce a inhibition on the GSK3 activity [94]. APS can inhibit ER stress by inhibiting ATF6 activation and PTP1B expression in streptozotocin-induced T2DM rats. microRNAs microarray combined with bioinformatics has been used to screen differentially expressed microRNAs after treatment with APS in T2DM Goto Kakizaki (GK) rats. apoptosis is mainly mediated by intrinsic mitochondrial-mediated apoptotic signaling pathway and extrinsic death receptor-mediated apoptotic signaling pathway. the change of mitochondrial extracorporeal membrane permeability (MOMP) can promote the release of cytochrome C from mitochondria to the cytoplasm. inflammatory factors such as TNF- can activate Fas death receptors and then promote the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins Caspas APS could increase proliferation, inhibit apoptosis and improve antioxidative function. db/db diabetic hearts had elevated rates of fatty acid oxidation, ectopic fat deposition and subsequent lipid peroxidation by PPAR regulatory pathways. high glucose-induced inflammation, renal microangiopathy, renal injury and fibrosis are main characteristics of diabetic nephropathy. APS was proven to inhibit the expression of inflammatory factors and alleviate diabetic nephropathy by inhibiting the NF-B signaling pathway in streptozotocin-induced diabetic nephropathy rats. over-expression of TGF-1 can promote the expression of its downstream SMAD and then promote the EMT process, thereby promoting renal fibrosis in diabetic nephropathy. the overexpression of miR-21 activated the -catenin pathway and the TGF-1/Smads pathway in the process of podocyte dedifferentiation and mesangial cell activation. AS-IV could also improve renal function and fibrosis in diabetic KK-Ay mice. cytokines secreted by Th1 cells include IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-12, TNF- and INF-. APS could downregulate blood glucose level, upregulate serum insulin concentration, increased beta cell mass and decrease apoptotic beta cell percentage.

CG was likely to be hydrolyzed in enterocytes to its aglycone calycosin. pharmacokinetic characteristics of CG were determined after oral administration of CG in rats. hepatic first-pass effect, as well as the UGT-mediated metabolism, could account for the low detection of CG in plasma and urine. ononin had a relatively low bioavailability of 7.3%. after an oral administration, ononin had a small absorption in the small intestine and most parts were absorbed in the large intestine. permeability of ononin was poor, which is proposed as an alternative contributor for its poor bioavailability. the absolute bioavailability of AS-IV in beagle dogs was fairly low (7.4%), which would restrict its application in oral administration. it was also confirmed that AS-IV has low gastrointestinal tract absorption and bioavailability in rats in another study. brachyoside B (Bra B), cyclogaleginoside B (Cyc B), cycloastragenol (CA), iso-cycloastragenol (iso-CA) and a dehydrogenated metabolite of CA (CA-2H) the metabolism of AS-IV in intestinal microbiota was markedly inhibited. variations in intestinal microbiota may change the disposition of AS-IV. isoflavonoids and their metabolites are the major type of constituents absorbed in plasma. daidzein was not found in the AR water extract but its metabolite D-7-G could be detected in the plasma. the plasma concentration of calycosin, a major constituent in AR, was too low to be detected. 51 compounds in AR extract and 31 prototype compounds with nine metabolites were detected in mice plasma. flavonoids and saponins accounted for almost three-quarters of the 31 compounds. pharmacokinetic studies on AR ethanol extract were also reported. mononetin, AS-IV, were analyzed after oral administration of AR water extract in mice. formononetin showed relatively slow absorption and elimination with tmax at 2 h and t1/2 at 3.99 h. the double-peak phenomenon as a common phenomenon in the absorption of AR flavonoids was found. in and calycosin in vivo and attributed to biotransformation of flavonoid glycosides to aglucones by intestinal bacteria and enzymes in vivo. a great increase of formononetin and calycosin in plasma.

AS-IV is the most abundant saponin and a characteristic compound of AR. the pharmacokinetic behavior of pure AS-IV ingested by rats and dogs have been widely studied and clearly elucidated. studies reported the absorption of AS-IV in the perfused rat intestinal model. it was found that the transport of AS-IV was predominantly via a passive route. a total of 22 metabolites, including phases I and II metabolites, were detected. the metabolism of AS-IV in intestinal microbiota was markedly inhibited. variations in intestinal microbiota may change the disposition of AS-IV. a similar study also confirmed that the bacteria play a crucial role in the metabolism and biotransformation of AS-IV in vivo. two superfamilies of phase II enzymes catalyze the formation of hydrophilic phase II conjugates for flavonoids. flavonoids and their conjugates, which are transported to the liver, may be subject to additional metabolism or excretion via the bile [24,214,215]. formononetin and daidzin conjugates are the main existent form in rat plasma after oral and intravenous administration. formononetin was moderately bioavailable in rats with absolute bioavailability of 21.8%. formononetin was moderately bioavailable in rats with an absolute bioavailability of 21.8%. glucuronide was the main metabolite in intact Caco-2 cell model. the excretion of formononetin is mediated by the multidrug resistance-related proteins (MRPs) and organic anion transporters.

CG was likely to be hydrolyzed in enterocytes to its aglycone calycosin by broad-specific -glucuronides (BSG) and glucocerebrosidase. then, calycosin was rapidly and extensively metabolized by UGTs to 3\u2032-glucuronide in the enterocytes and liver. the metabolites were also transported into the lumen by BCRP and MRP2. ononin had a relatively low bioavailability of 7.3%. after an oral administration, ononin had a small absorption in the small intestine. permeability of ononin was poor, which is proposed as an alternative contributor for its poor bioavailability. a total of 22 metabolites, including phases I and II metabolites, were detected. a total of 22 metabolites, including phases I and II metabolites, was detected and tentatively identified. authors investigated enterohepatic circulation of AS-IV. brachyoside B (Bra B), cyclogaleginoside B (Cyc B), cycloastragenol (CA), iso-cycloastragenol (iso-CA) and a dehydrogenated metabolite of CA (CA-2H). only 62 patients showed markedly attenuated disease after oral AR administration at the dose of less than 30 g. only 39 patients were cured, which corresponds to a cure rate of 7.5%. the personalized use of AR represents a novel strategy that is necessary for obtaining AR with enhanced efficacy and precise treatment. pharmacokinetic studies on AR concluded that the coupling of UGTs and ETs plays a crucial role in regulating the bioavailability of the bioactive compounds from AR. it can be speculated that the diverse polymorphisms of UGTs extensively exist in different individuals, which directly regulate the efficacy and toxicity of drugs in different individuals. significant associations between sorafenib exposure and the studied polymorphisms were observed for ABCB1 3435C > T SNP in the patients during the treatment with sorafenib of hepatocellular carcinoma [248] rheumatoid arthritis-patients carrying wild-type alleles of MDR1 might benefit from P-gp inhibition or administration of glucocorticoid analogs that are non-P-gp substrates. a higher plasma concentration of substrate is observed in patients carrying an ABCG2 c.421C > A allele. the polymorphisms in the UGTs and ETs are important determinants of inter-individual differences in the toxicities and response to many drugs. thus, the genetic polymorphisms of the UGTs and ETs can be applied to characterize and optimize personalized therapies of AR in clinics in the future. in the last decade, the molecular mechanisms involved in the therapeutic effects of AR have been widely studied and reported. but further investigation is needed because of the various and complicated compounds contained in AR. more than 200 compounds have been isolated and identified from AR."}
