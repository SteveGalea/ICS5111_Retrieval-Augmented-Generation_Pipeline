{"summary": "this study aimed to exploratively develop a standardized preparedness system to use during unfolding threats of severe infectious diseases. a qualitative three-step study among infectious disease prevention and control experts was performed. these triggers informed the design of a phased preparedness system which was tested in a focus group discussion. international response to ebola was inadequate in the Netherlands. a multidisciplinary national EVD outbreak evaluation in the Netherlands concluded that better guidance on preparedness was needed for diseases such as EVD. the EVD outbreak showed that successful preparedness during a threat requires flexibility and adaptations to be able to respond to differences. the aim of this study was to define preparedness during an unfolding threat of an infectious disease that requires centralized care. we aimed at finding generic triggers for preparedness, applicable to different types of healthcare institutions, such as hospitals, ambulance services, general practitioners and the municipal health services. the municipal health service (MHS) was also involved because of their coordinating role between all partners at the regional level. a hypothetical scenario of a fictitious marburg virus outbreak was used for data collection. the outbreak scenario consisted of three stages, each hypothetically representing a preparedness phase of the preparedness system. the preparedness system was adjusted based on the results from step 2 and was sent by e-mail to the participant to discuss in step 3. the results of step 3 were used to finalize the preparedness system by grouping preparedness activities into overarching topics. participants discussed specific needs and adaptations per preparedness phase of the preparedness system. participants discussed specific needs and adaptations per preparedness phase of the preparedness system. participants discussed specific needs and adaptations per preparedness phase of the preparedness system. the municipal health service (MHS) was additionally involved because of their coordinating role between all partners at the regional level. the invited key player was not able to participate, we asked him or her to nominate a colleague in the same type of healthcare institution. the outbreak scenario consisted of three stages, each hypothetically representing a preparedness phase of the preparedness system. the preparedness system was adjusted based on the results from step 2 and was sent by e-mail to the participant to discuss in step 3. a focus group discussion with 1\u20133 representatives per type of healthcare institution was organized to validate the concept preparedness system. participants discussed terminology for preparedness during a threat. participants discussed specific needs and adaptations per preparedness phase of the preparedness system. participants discussed specific needs and adaptations per preparedness phase of the preparedness system. a mixed focus group discussion with 1\u20133 representatives per type of healthcare institution was organized to validate the concept preparedness system. the focus group took place at the RIVM and lasted 2 hours and 15 mintues. participants were asked if preparedness would be necessary within their institutions, what they would expect other healthcare institutions to do. study population In step 1, we invited 8 participants, of whom 3 could not be included. a microbiologist of an academic hospital, an infection preventionist in a general hospital, a medical manager of the national ambulance service, and a regional communicable disease control consultant. participants included participants per step. \"scaling up\" and \"enhanced preparation\" were used as synonyms. a third trigger was the situation of several patients hospitalized within the country. the final preparedness system based on these three triggers consists of four preparedness phases and is shown in Figure 4. Preparedness phase green is a situation without the presence of the infectious disease threat that requires centralized care, anywhere in the world. the system provides in rows the four ascending preparedness phase, and in columns the preparedness activities divided by topic. academic hospitals and peripheral hospitals named preparedness activities for patient care. a sub-commission on preparedness for the admittance of patients needs to be installed. in preparedness phase orange, preparedness activities should start, except for diagnostics and patients' care/cure. the preparedness activities of general practitioners are limited to triage and primary infection prevention in all preparedness phases. collaborative preparedness activities were discussed in all interview rounds. participants of all types of healthcare institutions stressed aligned preparedness activities are preferred over institutional autonomy. participants of all types of healthcare institutions stressed aligned preparedness activities are preferred over institutional autonomy. in step 3, we re-invited 7 participants from step 2, of whom only 3 accepted participation. one of the infection preventionists, the GP and representative of the NHG, and one of the regional communicable disease control consultants. if the likelihood of admitting a VHF patient increases, they would enhance preparations. for academic hospitals, general hospitals and ambulance services, only an outbreak in their region would lead to preparedness activities. a third trigger was the situation of several (potential) patients hospitalized within the country. academic hospitals, peripheral hospitals and ambulance services named preparedness activities for patient care. academic hospitals and peripheral hospitals discussed the need to prepare their personnel for extra working hours. general practitioners and municipal health services needed preparedness for controlling unrest among their staff and the population. GPs, academic hospitals and ambulance services described how to deal with suspected cases in life-threatening situations. they need guidance on when concerns for their own safety would overrule their duty as a care provider, and based on which criteria. participants explicitly stated that these were dilemmas during the latest EVD outbreak. the aim of this study was to define preparedness during an infectious disease that requires centralized care. the four identified preparedness phases were based on (a) the likelihood of presentation of an infected patient to one of the healthcare institutions and (b) the unrest among the general population and staff. this system could be used for any future threat from an infectious disease requiring centralized care. specific phases for frontline institutions emerged during the evaluation of the Ebola threat. the identified triggers for enhanced preparedness match with other studies and theory. the founding risk classification theory of Kinney and Wiruth (1976) states that risk is the chance that something happens times the impact of that event. absence of uniform terminology impedes communication between public and curative health care, while smooth communication between the two is a must, especially during threats or outbreaks. centralized care in dedicated health centers for patients suspected for an infectious disease requiring centralized care is described in Israel [7], the United States [19], and in Canada [20]. participants may have reported from previous EVD experience where sometimes activities were performed in phase yellow, organge or red, whereas ideally these should be tackled in the green phase. most participants worked in the most urbanized parts of the Netherlands. data Availability The datasets generated and/or analyzed during the current study are not publicly available due to the privacy protection of the participants. consent All participants provided informed consent and were informed that their responses would be used for research purposes. authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.
