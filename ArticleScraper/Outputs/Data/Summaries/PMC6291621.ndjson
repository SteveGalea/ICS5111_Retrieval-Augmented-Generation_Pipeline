{"summary": "the human sodium iodide symporter gene has emerged as one of the most promising reporter genes in preclinical and translational research for oncology and gene therapy. the hNIS symporter is an intrinsic plasma membrane protein belonging to the sodium/solute symporter family, which drives negatively charged solutes into the cytoplasm using a sodium ion electrochemical gradient (10) the advantages of hNIS as an imaging reporter gene include its relatively hNIS is unlikely to perturb the underlying cell biochemistry. no negative effects of resultant sodium influx have been observed. animal models for MERS-CoV are under development with no single model identified as the standard. reporter gene with an emerging virus such as MERS-CoV requires functional evaluation of the recombinant virus to ensure similar fitness to the parental pathogen. rMERS-CoV/hNIS replicated similarly to rMERS-CoV in vero E6 cells infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. the cells were infected with either rMERS-CoV or rMERS-CoV/hNIS at an MOI of 0.01 (c) or 3 (d) and analyzed by light microscopy at the indicated time points. RT-PCR confirmed hNIS expression in rMERS-CoV/hNIS-infected cells up to 96 h. rMERS-CoV/hNIS cells were infected with rMERS-CoV/hNIS (a) or parental rMERS-CoV (b) at an MOI of 0.01 or 3 and then collected at 96 h postinfection for RT-PCR. RNA was extracted from cells 72 h postinfection followed by RT-PCR at passage 6. vero E6 cells were infected with rMERS-CoV or rMERS-CoV/hNIS at an MOI of 0.01 or 0.04. images of the plates acquired at 24 h postinfection were acquired. 99mTc-pertechnetate uptake was dependent on the virus MOI. uptake by rMERS-CoV/hNIS-infected cells was also dependent on the dose of 99mTc-pertechnetate. the relationship between radioactivity measured by the gamma camera on plate images and the dose of 99mTc-pertechnetate added to each well was linear with high correlation. at 96 hours postinfection with an MOI of 0.01, uptake was slightly above the background level when the 99mTc-pertechnetate dose of effective inhibition of 99mTc-pertechnetate uptake with 0.1 mM sodium perchlorate declined between 48 and 96 h postinfection. by 96 h postinfection, 99mTc-pertechnetate uptake in rMERS-CoV/hNIS-infected cells was nearly double the uptake at 24 h postinfection. SPECT/CT imaging was performed to determine whether sites of virus replication were evident in these animals. the low resolution of the clinical scanner used in our biocontainment facility prevented clear discrimination of hNIS-expressing tissues and limited the utility of the imaging. exposed animals did not reveal any significant pathological changes except in one of the five mice in group 2 (rMERS-CoV) the right caudodorsal lung lobe of this animal was congested. microscopically, minimal-to-mild perivascular and peribronchiolar inflammation was noted multifocally. representative mouse infected with rMERS-CoV/hNIS (group 2) with multifocal, minimal-to-mild perivascular and peribronchiolar inflammation, with congestion at day 7 pe. rMERS-CoV/hNIS (group 4) with multifocal, minimal-to-mild perivascular and peribronchiolar inflammation with congestion at day 7 pe. the asterisk in lane 5* of the rMERS-CoV/hNIS-treated group indicates altered PCR conditions (48\u00b0C annealing temperature, 3% dimethyl sulfoxide) to improve the sensitivity to detect rMERS-CoV/hNIS. the differences in viral loads between groups 2 and 3 were not statistically significant. rMERS-CoV/hNIS replicated similarly to rMERS-CoV in vero E6 cells infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 with a peak in virus yield of 4 log10 plaque-forming units (PFU)/ml at 24 h. at an MOI of 3, viral yields peaked at 7 log10 PFU/ml at 48 h. the cells were infected with either rMERS-CoV or rMERS-CoV/hNIS at an MOI of 0.01 or 3 (d) and analyzed by light microscopy at the indicated time points. expression of the hNIS transgene was evaluated by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) using primers to specifically detect hNIS expression by MERS-CoV. hNIS functionality in rMERS-CoV/hNIS-infected cells was demonstrated in vitro. a series of assays were performed to characterize the kinetics of 99mTc-pertechnetate cellular uptake. rMERS-CoV/hNIS-infected cells were differentiated from the background radioactivity in the wells. 99mTc-pertechnetate uptake by rMERS-CoV/hNIS-infected cells at an MOI of 0.01 or 0.04 at 24 and 48 h postinfection. uptake by rMERS-CoV/hNIS-infected cells was dependent on the virus. the 99mTc-pertechnetate dose should be considered a limiting factor for detection of hNIS expression in rMERS-CoV/hNIS-infected cells. no changes in 99mTc-pertechnetate accumulation were detected in the wells infected with the parental virus rMERS-CoV. sodium perchlorate blocked 99.5% of the cellular uptake of 99mTc-pertechnetate in rMERS-Co 99mTc-pertechnetate uptake was reduced in rMERS-CoV/hNIS-infected cells with increasing sodium perchlorate concentrations. in vivo evaluation of rMERS-CoV/hNIS mice were challenged with parental rMERS-CoV or rMERS-CoV/hNIS by the intranasal route. netate in infected 288/330+/+ transgenic mice followed by SPECT/CT imaging. rMERS-CoV/hNIS specific 99mTc-pertechnetate uptake in the lungs. mice in groups 2 and 3, respectively, infected with rMERS-CoV or rMERS-CoV/hNIS. the percentage of mice with alterations in the lung was higher on day 7 pe compared to that observed on day 3 pe. extensive focal congestion in the lungs and multifocal congestion in the kidneys were observed in one of five mice from group 1 receiving sham infection. the leftmost lane contains molecular size markers (in kilobases) the next three lanes contain stock controls, rMERS-CoV/hNIS (stock control, without RT step), rMERS-CoV stock and rMERS-CoV/hNIS stock. rMERS-CoV 3 40 (2) 40 (2) 80 (4) 40 (2) Group 3 (6) rMERS-CoV/hNIS 3 33 (2) 33 (2) 83 (4) 50 (3) Group 4 (6) rMERS-CoV 7 33 (2) 50 (3) 100 (6) 33 (2) Group 5 (6) rMERS-CoV/hNIS 7 17 (1) 67 (4) 100 (6) 50 (3) Infectious virus could be detected only in the lungs from 3/6 mice from group 3 (5.01 rMERS-CoV/hNIS has similar fitness to the parental virus, rMERS-CoV. genetic stability of the hNIS transgene cloned into MERS-CoV was confirmed over six in vitro passages. kinetics, fitness, and cytopathic effect in vivo also support similar fitness. rMERS-CoV/hNIS was detected by PCR in only 50% of infected mice on day 3 pe, suggesting limited in vivo genetic stability. a clone of the MERS-15 virus with an ORF5 deletion was attenuated compared to a clone in which the ORF5 gene was not deleted. imaging with a small-animal PET scanner and PET radiotracer 18F-tetrafluoroborate would improve image quality and sensitivity. alternative to the SPECT is use of a gamma counter to measure the radioactivity in the tissues; unfortunately, a suitable gamma counter is not available in our biosafety level 4 laboratory. the hNIS open reading frame (ORF) was inserted into the NS5 ORF of MERS-CoV. the nine bases between the M gene TRS and its start codon were included at the start of the hNIS sequence and cloned using the SanDI restriction enzyme site upstream of ORF 6. rMERS-CoV and rMERS-CoV/hNIS plaque assays were performed in vero E6 cells as previously described (32) for titration of virus in tissues, the collected tissues were homogenized using a bead-based tissue homogenizer to make a 10% homogenate in DMEM plus 2% FBS (Sigma) one-step and multistep growth curves and serial passage. stock rMERS-CoV/hNIS was used as a positive control. uninfected-cell lysates were used as a negative control for RT-PCR. cells were infected with 99mTc-pertechnetate. 99mTc-pertechnetate counts from each well were converted into radioactivity units. decay-corrected relative to the time of probe introduction to the wells. recombinant parental virus (rMERS-CoV) and MERS-CoV expressing hNIS (rMERS-CoV/hNIS) were generated as previously described (30) the hNIS open reading frame (ORF) was inserted into the NS5 ORF of MERS-CoV. rMERS-CoV and rMERS-CoV/hNIS plaque assays were performed in vero E6 cells as previously described (32) for titration of virus in tissues, the collected tissues were homogenized using a bead-based tissue homogenizer to make a 10% homogenate in DMEM plus 2% FBS (Sigma) one-step and multistep growth curves and serial passage. hNIS6 (reverse primer sequence, 5\u2032GAAGCCACTTAGCATCAC) were used to create PCR products. stock rMERS-CoV/hNIS was used as a positive control. uninfected-cell lysates were used as a negative control for RT-PCR. 99mTc-pertechnetate counts from each well were converted into radioactivity units. decay-corrected relative to the time of probe introduction to the wells. mice were monitored daily for clinical signs of disease. using Graphpad Prism 7.03 (Graphpad Software Inc.) as indicated in the text."}
