{"summary": "HSPG is composed of a core protein covalently linked to glycosaminoglycan chains formed by unbranched anionic polysaccharides. the core protein of syndecans is composed of an extracellular domain, a single transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic domain that interacts with the cell. glycans are encoded by 6 different genes and are anchored in the cell membrane via glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) the synthesis of HSPG is initiated through the attachment of the first tetrasaccharide (i.e., xylose, galactose, galactose, glucuronic acid) to a serine residue (Ser) of the core protein. enzymes are involved in the degradation of HSPG, in particular heparanase-1. similar enzymes are expressed also by bacteria and used as a tool to modify HSPG on the cell surface. HSPG in the ECM contribute to basement membrane organization. ocytosis and lysosomal degradation can be shed in response to stress after proteolytic cleavage. more detailed descriptions of HSPG physiological, pathological, and morphological functions are beyond the aim of this review. adenovirus 5 [50,51,52] Adenovirus 2 [50,51,52] Filoviruses [53,54] Rhinovirus 8 [55] Coronavirus NL63 [56,57] Coxsackie virus B3 [63] Rabies virus [64] Rhinovirus 54 [65] Yellow fever virus [66] Swine vesicular disease virus [67] Enterovirus 71 [68] Japanese encephalitis virus [69, HSV-1 causes mainly herpes labialis and is transmitted by intimate oral contact. HSV-2 causes herpes genitalis and is transmitted by sexual intercourse. both HSV-1 and HSV-2 use HSPG to attach to the cell surface. a specific interaction between gD and different receptors mediates the entry. a soluble form of 3O-HS can mediate HSV-1 infection in CHO-K1. a soluble form of 3O-HS can mediate HSV-1 attachment and fusion in primary corneal fibroblasts. drimers, nanoparticles, and others inhibit HSV infection, further supporting the role of HS in viral attachment [27,92,93,94]. drimers, nanoparticles, and others inhibit HSV infection, further supporting the role of HS in viral attachment. human papillomavirus (HPV) is a small, non-enveloped dsDNA virus in the papillomaviridae family. it is a small, non-enveloped dsDNA virus in the papillomaviridae family. HPVs are the most common sexually transmitted viruses. they are subdivided into low-risk types, which can cause low-grade cervical lesions and genital warts. high-risk types can cause cervix carcinoma, anus, vulva, vagina, penis, and oropharynx cancers. a significant decrease in infection was observed in presence of these treatments. the critical residues for the interaction between HSPG and HPV have been mapped as Lys278 and Lys361 on the exposed portion of the capsid protein L1 [126]. this leads to the loss of affinity for HSPG and binding to different secondary receptors. dengue Virus (DENV) is an enveloped, positive-sense single-stranded RNA (ssRNA+) virus of the Flaviviridae family. it is composed of 4 distinct serotypes (DENV1, DENV2, DENV3, DENV4) the virus is transmitted by aedes mosquito bites. several papers have been published on the interaction between the E protein and HSPG in human endothelial, liver, and animal cell lines. it is unclear if there is also an interaction with HSPG in insect cell lines (C6/36) to exclude any effect linked to cell adaptation. infections in neurons of the sensory ganglia may reactivate and cause recurrent lesions at the site of primary infection. the absence of HSPG expression does not abolish the infection rate, but decreases it significantly, as the virus rarely binds directly its entry receptor. a soluble form of 3O-HS mediates HSV-1 attachment and fusion in primary corneal fibroblasts. gL also play a fundamental role in this process, forming a fusion complex, together with gD and gB, necessary for release of the tegument proteins and viral DNA into the host cell. this mechanism prevents virus trapping at the cell surface through receptor binding, as does the cleavage of sialic acid by influenza neuraminidase [90,91] dendrimer [98] Carrageenans [102] Sulfated K5 derivatives [103] Sulfated K5 derivatives [101] Agmatine-derived polymers [104] DSTP 27 ** [94] HIV Heparin [27] HPV Heparin c [105] Carrageenans d [27,106,107] Carrageenans c,e [105,108,109] Cellulose sulfate d [95,110 human papillomavirus (HPV) is a small, non-enveloped dsDNA virus in the papillomaviridae family. it infects the epithelial cells of the skin and the anogenital oropharyngeal mucosa. it infects the epithelial cells of the skin and the anogenital oropharyngeal mucosa. contact is mediated mainly by HSPG expressed on the cellular surface of basal keratinocytes or on the ECM. a role for laminin-332 (formerly called laminin-5) in the attachment has also been proposed. the dependence on HSPG has been demonstrated in vitro, but also in vivo. -31 pseudovirions in epithelial cells is independent of clathrin and caveolae [129,131] suggesting a common endocytic pathway for all HPV. HSPG-mimicking molecules such as small molecules, dendrimers, carrageenan, heparin, and nanoparticles have proven to be effective for preventing HPV infection. sulfation on cells reduced DENV infectivity, as demonstrated by treatment of Vero cells with heparinase I and III or sodium chlorate (a sulfation inhibitor) and through infection in psg-D677 and psg-A745 CHO cell lines. the interaction site with HSPG has been mapped to domain III of the dengue envelope protein, on an external loop region rich in surface basic residues. viruses become HSPG-dependent after repeated passage in cell culture. a possible outcome is an increase in the number of basic residues on their surface protein. this leads to improved viral fitness and the out-competing of HSPG-independent variants. the third RV species, RV-C, uses cadherin-related family member 3 (CDHR3) to infect the cell. exogenous expression of CDHR3 in these cells renders the cells permissive to RV-C. rhinoviruses are small ssRNA+ viruses in the Enterovirus genus. they are the main causes of acute viral infections worldwide. in immunocompetent individuals, RVs typically induce the common cold with nasal congestion and rhinorrhea, coughing, sneezing, sore throat and malaise. some major group RVs (RV-8, -54, -89) can also use HSPG as an additional receptor [55,60,65] either directly or after multiple passages in cells lacking ICAM1. the third RV species, RV-C, uses cadherin-related family member 3 (CDHR3) to infect the cell. enterovirus 71 EV-A71 is a non-enveloped ssRNA+ virus in the Picornaviridae family. it is associated with mutations in VP1 and a change of cellular tropism with lytic infection in a wider spectrum of cell lines. the virus adapts easily to HS binding during tissue culture. no effective antiviral treatment is currently available for EV-A71 infections. EV-A71 can infect cells via two entry receptors that trigger viral uncoating and RNA release in the cytoplasm. a single mutation in the VP1 capsid protein was present in the blood and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and in the gastrointestinal tract. polyomaviruses belong to the family of polyomaviridae. they are non-enveloped dsDNA viruses. the majority of these viruses can hemagglutinate erythrocytes. enterovirus 71 EV-A71 is a non-enveloped ssRNA+ virus in the Picornaviridae family. EV-A71 is one of the major causative agents of the mild and self-limiting hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) outbreaks in the Asia-Pacific region. EV-A71 can use a variety of attachment receptors such as HSPG [68], sialic acids [165], nucleolin [152,166], vimentin [140,167], and annexin II [168]. a single mutation in the VP1 capsid protein was present in the blood and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and in the gastrointestinal tract. dsDNA viruses persistently infect the majority of the population. the primary infection occurs in early childhood through person-to-person contact. however, healthy individuals do not show any signs of disease. in immunocompromised patients, the viruses can reactivate and cause pathologies. heparinase treatment and increased heparin inhibition can confer the ability to infect neural cells. mutations and differences in binding can confer the ability to infect neural cells, which are known to express high levels of glypicans and syndecans. nucleolin [180], ICAM1 [181], C-X3-C motif chemokine receptor 1 (CX3CR1) [182], and annexin II [183]. these interactions induce a conformational change of the F protein with exposure of its fusion peptide. enzymatic removal of HSPG from the cellular surface, as well as inhibition of sulfation have shown that RSV initial attachment to cells is HSPG-dependent [118,177 HSPG, in particular syndecan-1 and syndecan-4, are abundant in the alveolar epithelia. restricted HSPG expression at the apical side of HAE may also be due to artifacts linked to HAE differentiation in vitro. the results of successive studies that used the full virus did not indicate a dependence of ZIKV on HSPG. a negatively charged molecule proved to be active against ZIKV, but not through inhibition of HSPG binding. however, the infectivity of ZIKV in cell lines was not diminished after sodium chlorate wash. ZIKV, as well as DENV, requires expression of EXT1 and NDST1. another study showed that ZIKV binding to cells was not affected by inactivation of the HS biosynthetic pathway gene. monoclonal antibody directed against RSV fusion (F) protein is limited to pre-term, low-weight, immunocompromised infants [175,176] it involves an initial interaction between the basic amino acids present on the viral envelope proteins G and F and the negatively charged HSPG. these interactions induce a conformational change of the F protein with exposure of its fusion peptide. there has been no study in HAE with clinical isolates to investigate whether HSPG binding is linked to cellular adaptation or is a property of all RSV strains. in the latter case, this receptor may be used by the virus in vivo to infect cells expressing HSPG such as in the alveoli or in yet unidentified cells. a study using a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) binding assay showed that ZIKV E protein interacts with HS and chondroitin sulfates. the binding constant (Kd) is 443 nM, while that of DENV E protein is 15 nM. the results of successive studies that used the full virus did not indicate a dependence of ZIKV on HSPG. a clinical isolate was serially passaged in vero cells. the mutation in domain III of the ZIKV E protein boosted viral infectivity. HSPG is highly expressed in almost all human tissues. HSPG binding promotes HIV neurovirulence by allowing the infection of endothelial cells that do not express CD4. increased neurovirulence was also described for a natural isolate of North American eastern equine encephalitis virus compared to a mutant with impaired HSPG binding ability. a HSPG-binding mutant was isolated from the blood and CSF of a patient with disseminated infection. a recent study in a mouse model of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection also corroborates a negative association between HSPG binding and viral spread. the authors suggested that HBV could use this process to avoid becoming trapped in the blood stream. with this strategy, the virus can reach the liver and after binding HSPG, infect the cells via its receptor, sodium/taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) HSPG binding appears to promote dissemination and neurovirulence. in other reports, it traps the virus and leads to attenuated infection. several HSPG-mimicking compounds have failed in phase III clinical trials."}
