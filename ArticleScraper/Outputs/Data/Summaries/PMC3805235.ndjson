{"summary": "whole blood was collected in PAXgene tubes, together with routine clinical samples. patients were recruited early in their admission, before diagnostic studies were completed. written, informed consent was obtained. microarray Analysis Expression data were analyzed using \u2018R\u2019 Language and Environment for Statistical Computing 2.12.1 and GeneSpringGX 11.5 software (Agilent) the data have been deposited in NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus and are accessible through Series accession number GSE42026. differences in gender, severity of illness, and deaths were calculated using 2 tests of independence. RNA Expression Profiling PAXgene tubes were extracted using PAXgene Blood RNA extraction kits (Qiagen) biotin-labeled cRNA was prepared using Illumina TotalPrep RNA Amplification kits (Applied Biosystems) two children in the H1N1/09, RSV, and bacterial cohorts had oral or intravenous steroids prior to blood sampling. Statistical Analysis of Cohorts Differences between cohorts in age, proportion of white cell type, and days from illness onset to presentation were calculated using Kruskall-Wallis tests. differences in gender, severity of illness, and deaths were calculated using 2 tests of independence. RESULTS Our consecutively recruited cohort included 25 patients with H1N1/09 infection. support vector machine (SVM) with leave-one-out validation, strong class prediction sensitivity was achieved (96%; Supplementary Data 1). as the RSV patients were significantly younger than the control or H1N1/09 patients, we compared the RNA expression signature of RSV to a subgroup of the youngest controls. eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2 - P = 3.16 1025), eukaryotic initiation factor 4 (eIF4 - P = 3.24 1088) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR - P = 1.91 106) transcripts with reduced abundance were enriched for pathways including antigen presentation through MHC class II (TAP1, MR1, HLA-B) a publically available adult data set was used for H1N1/09 and controls. there was complete segregation of patients and controls when SDE transcripts from our data were used for clustering. of 69 transcripts in the top canonical pathway, 32 were SDE in the validation data set. the most significant canonical pathways were related to protein synthesis. eIF2 pathway (P = 2.0 1020 and 9.0 1010), eIF4 (P = 4.7 108 and 0.006), and mTOR (P = 8.1 107 and 0.016) for H1N1/09 vs RSV, and H1N1/09 vs bacterial infection, respectively. each bar is colored in proportion to the number of SDE H1N1/09 transcripts increased (red) or decreased (green) in abundance relative to the comparator cohort. protein synthesis pathways (yellow) were the most significant in all 3 comparisons. transcripts with reduced abundance were enriched for pathways including antigen presentation through MHC class II (most decreased: HLA-DQA, HLA-DPB, HLA-DOA), T-cell signaling and protein synthesis. there was reduced expression in 63 of 69 SDE transcripts in the eIF2 pathway, P.0001. patients with H1N1/09 showed increased expression in well-established pathways of the innate antiviral immune response. many interferon-induced genes with anti-viral roles showed increased expression, including IFI27 (P = 5.8 1011, FC 72.3) increased IFITM3 expression (P = 3 103, FC 6.25) supports its role in H1N1/09 infection. differences in lymphocyte proportion do not explain the observed differences. differential expression of translation initiation pathway genes was identified in symptomatic but not subclinical infections. increased expression of protein synthesis-inhibiting genes with reduced expression of translation initiation genes is likely to impair protein synthesis. suppression of protein synthesis may be a distinctive feature of H1N1/09 infection. the association of influenza with bacterial infection is well known. changes in RNA expression during disease may result from altered cell type proportions, as well as upregulation or downregulation of genes."}
