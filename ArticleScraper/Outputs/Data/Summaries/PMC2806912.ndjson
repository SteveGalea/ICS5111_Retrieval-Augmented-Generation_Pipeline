{"summary": "from 2003 to November 2009, influenza H5N1 virus has caused 444 confirmed human cases and 262 of them were fatal. human H5N1 cases were found in 15 countries; the three most affected countries were Vietnam, China and Indonesia. a swine origin influenza H1N1 virus (H1N1pdm) has recently emerged to become pandemic. undifferentiated NHBE cells were readily infected with both seasonal H1N1 and avian H5N1 viruses. but H5N1 influenza virus induced exceptionally high levels of cytokines and chemokines when compared to the contemporary human influenza H1N1 virus. the virus behaved differently in the ud- and wd-NHBE cells. these results emphasized the importance of using a physiologically relevant respiratory epithelium model to study the pathogenesis of influenza virus. wd-NHBE cells were plated into a culture flask in a humidified atmosphere. cells were incubated in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO2, 37\u00b0C) after subculture, they were plated to a cell density of 2.5105 cells/cm2. the expression of human airway trypsin-like protease was detected by RT-qPCR using the mRNA extracted from the NHBE cultures. human bronchial tissue was also stained with -tubulin and MUC5AC. development was performed using the AEC substrate kit (Vector, Burlingame), the nuclei were counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin and then the sections were dried and mounted with DAKO aqueous mount (Dako Cytomation, Cambridgeshire, UK). ud- and wd-NHBE cell cultures were infected with influenza A viruses at a multiplicity of infection (MOIs of 2 for the analysis of virus replication and at a the cell layer was fixed at 16 h post infection using 4% paraformaldehyde for immunofluorescence staining with mouse anti-influenza nucleoprotein and matrix antibody conjugated with FITC. gene expression profile for cytokines, TNF-alpha (TNF-) and interferon beta (IFN-) and chemokines (IP-10, RANTES) and viral matrix gene were quantified and normalized using the housekeeping gene product -actin mRNA. the concentrations of IFN-, RANTES and IP-10 proteins in culture supernatants were measured by ELISA assay as recommended by the manufacturer. culture of ud-NHBE Cells NHBE cells were grown and subcultured according to suppliers instructions in serum-free and hormone supplemented bronchial epithelial growth media. cells were incubated in humidified atmosphere (5% CO2, 37\u00b0C) under submerged conditions. medium was changed in the basolateral compartment every 48 h until day 21 of ALI culture. the transepithelial resistance was measured by EVOM epithelial voltohmeter. at day 21 of ALI culture, the NHBE cells became well differentiated and ready for use. sis lectin (MAL)-I and MAL-II identifie two linkages. sia-2-3Gal1-4GlcNAc and sia-2-3Gal1-3GalNAc respectively. sections were microwaved in citrate buffer and blocked with H2O2 in Tris buffered saline. the cell culture was incubated with the virus inoculum for 1 h in a water-jacketed 37\u00b0C incubator with 5% CO2 supply. the cell culture was rinsed 3 times with warm PBS. the infected cell culture was then replenished by the appropriate growth medium. the plates were observed for cytopathic effect daily. the end-point of viral dilution leading to CPE in 50% of inoculated wells was estimated. cDNA was synthesized with Oligo-dT primers and superscript III reverse transcriptase. hematoxylin and eosin staining of wd-NHBE cells after 7-days and 21-days in ALI culture showed pseudostratified columnar epithelium structure with ciliary projections. the ciliated cells on the wd-NHBE cells stained positive with -tubulin ( Figure 1C ) and goblet cells were stained positive with MUC5AC. lated MUC5AC showed the presence of both ciliated and mucus secreting goblet cells along the epithelium. we evaluated the transepithelial resistance developed between the apical and basolateral compartment of the NHBE cells in transwell inserts from day 1 to 21 of ALI culture from six independent NHBE cell cultures. ud-NHBE cells expressed more avian influenza Sia-2-3 linkage receptors. wd-NHBE cells showed strong binding with MAL-I and SNA. MAL-II binding was sparse, focal and confined to ciliated cells. influenza matrix (M) gene copy number was measured by quantitative PCR as a measure of viral replication after the infection of both influenza viruses. similar infection experiments in wd-NHBE cells showed comparable M gene transcription for both the influenza H1N1 and H5N1 viruses at 3 h and 6 h post infection. 1N1 and VN04/H5N1 virus infection with infection rates of 95.444.55% in HK98/H1N1 and 814.17% in VN04/H5N1 infected cells. virus titers peaked higher (p = 0.04) and earlier in wd-NHBE compared to ud-NHBE cell cultures. titers of virus in HK98/H5N1 infected ud-NHBE were significantly higher (p = 0.005) than in wd-NHBE. titer was determined after influenza viruses infected in ud- and wd-NHBE cells from 1 h to 48 h post infection at MOI of 2. NHBE cell cultures in the absence of exogenous trypsin. there was no convincing evidence of VN04/H5N1 virus replication in wd-NHBE cells with or without the addition of exogenous trypsin. we investigated the influence of the differentiation state of NHBE cells on the cytokine and chemokine responses induced by HK98/H1N1 and VN04/H5N1 viruses. the chart showed the mean and the standard error from three independent experiments. single asterisk indicated statistically significant difference of means with p0.05, double asterisks indicated statistically significant differences of means with p0.001. in wd-NHBE cells, VN04/H5N1 induced significantly higher IFN- and RANTES mRNA expression than HK98/H1N1 at 6 h post infection. the concentration of RANTES and IP-10 in the supernatants of mock infected cells was below the detection limit of the ELISA kit (31.25 g/ml and 62.5 g/ml, respectively) at 24 h post infection, VN04/H5N1 led to significantly higher RANTES secretion in ud-NHBE cells compared with HK98/H1N1 (p0.01). VN04/H5N1 virus infected ud-NHBE (dark bars) and wd-NHBE (grey bars) cells at 24 h post infection. double asterisk indicated statistically significant difference of means with p0.001. UD indicated the protein concentration of the sample is below the detection limit. human bronchus stained with (D) FITC-conjugated -tubulin and (F) biotinylated MUC5AC showed the presence of both ciliated and mucus secreting goblet cells along the epithelium. transepithelial resistance and (H) HAT mRNA expression by of the differentiating NHBE culture from D1 to D21 ALI culture. ud-NHBE cells expressed more avian influenza sia-2-3 linkage receptors. wd-NHBE cells showed strong binding with MAL-I ( Figure 2G and 2J) and SNA ( Figure 2F, cross-section) bound strongly and the SNA ( Figure 2C, en face and Figure 2F, cross-section) bound weakly to the ud-NHBE cells. influenza matrix (M) gene copy number was measured by quantitative PCR as measure of viral replication after the infection of both influenza viruses. similar infection experiments in ud-NHBE cells showed comparable M gene transcription for both the influenza H1N1 and H5N1 viruses at 3 h and 6 h post infection. the ud-NHBE cells were equally susceptible to HK98/H1N1 and VN04/H5N1 virus infection with infection rates of 95.444.55% in HK98/H1N1 and 814.17% in VN04/H5N1 infected cells. however, in wd-NHBE cell cultures, the percentage of cells infected by influenza VN04/H5N1 virus (8.630.69%) was significantly lower (p = 0.0 titers in ud-NHBE cells peaked at 24 h post infection with a significant increase in the virus titer (p = 0.006) at 24 h post infection, the titers of virus in ud-NHBE was significantly higher (p = 0.005) than in wd-NHBE cells. the low pathogenic HK98/H1N1 virus can replicate efficiently in both ud- and wd-NHBE cells in the absence of exogenous trypsin. on the other hand, there was no convincing evidence of VN04/H5N1 replication in wd-NHBE cells with or without the addition of exogenous trypsin. HK98/H1N1 virus induced a significantly higher RANTES expression than HK98/H1N1 virus infected cells at 6 h and 24 h post infection. but at 24 h post infection, RANTES and IP-10 mRNA expression levels were comparable in VN04/H5N1 and HK98/H1N1 viruses infected. this suggests that virus replication was required for cytokine induction. an increase in the MOI up to 5 did not result in changes in the expression profile of the cytokine and chemokine mRNA induced by the influenza H1N1 and H5N1 viruses in both the ud- and wd-NHBE cells. sensitivity of the IFN- ELISA (detection limit 250 g/ml) showed the mean and the standard error from three independent experiments. double asterisk indicated statistically significant difference of means with p0.001. UD indicated the protein concentration of the sample is below the detection limit. differences in Sia configurations and expression between ud-NHBE and wd-NHBE may explain at least in part, the different permissiveness to the human seasonal H1N1 and avian H5N1 viruses. lower abundance of Sia-2-3Gal1-3GalNAc in wd-NHBE may be associated with the lower permissiveness of these cells for avian influenza H5N1 virus. mucin secreted by the goblet cells was present in ud-NHBE cells. mucin secreted by the goblet cells was present in wd-NHBE cells. mucin secreted by the goblet cells was present in wd-NHBE cells. a strikingly different cytokine and chemokine expression was observed in ud-NHBE and wd-NHBE upon infection by the same virus. at 6 h post infection, wd-NHBE cells had an apparently reverse IFN- mRNA profile compared with HK98/H1N1 virus. in NHBE cells at 24 h post infection, H5N1 virus induces more IFN- than H1N1 virus. these apparently contradictory findings may partly reflect the cell type (Calu-3 vs. NHBE) and the extent of cell differentiation in the two experimental models. the origin and differentiation of bronchial epithelial cells has a major impact to the permissiveness of cells to influenza A virus replication. this reinforces the importance of the use of physiologically relevant models for the understanding of influenza pathogenesis."}
