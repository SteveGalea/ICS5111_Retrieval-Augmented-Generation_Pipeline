{"summary": "public health informatics (PHI; also known as public health & epidemiology informatics in Europe) focuses on the application of information and communications technologies (ICT) to promote the health of populations rather than individual patients. PHI is generally organized and conducted by governmental public health authorities, which is most often a nation\u2019s \u2018ministry of health\u2019 except in the united states where public health practice is dispersed among a federation of local, state and federal health agencies. a semi-systematic review of the biomedical literature was conducted between 2012 and 2014 in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines [3]. our review is based on the work conducted by the AMIA PHI and GHI working groups to present a \u2018Year in Review\u2019. information science, or computing had to be the primary subject of the study or a main component of the study methodology. the primary research must have focused on activities taking place within an LMIC. multiple volunteers from the PHI and GHI working groups assisted with review of candidate articles. reviewers examined titles, abstracts, and other article metadata. each article was reviewed by at least two individuals. data sources and searches Multiple searches were conducted between September 2013 and August 2014 using disparate keywords to identify all possible english-language literature indexed in PubMed or MEDLINE that was published between January 1, 2012 and September 30, 2014. the searches in 2014 expanded the keyword list to include the name of every LMIC as defined by the world bank. articles were excluded from the GHI group if the research occurred principally within a LMIC nation. the primary research must have focused on activities taking place within an LMIC. trainees in PHI programs volunteered to read through the full text of each selected article and summarize key metadata. they examined the information system implemented or evaluated (e.g., syndromic surveillance system, immunization information system); method of data capture (e.g., electronic health record, mobile device); impact of the technology on practice or research. 1241 GHI articles were excluded when they did not focus on informatics or an information system. candidates were excluded when they did not focus on an information system. all four systems remained in the 'Top 4' each year. in Figure-4, we summarize the methods used in the PHI articles. 43 articles used a quantitative methodology. just nine articles employed a controlled experimental or comparative design. more recent articles tended to focus on information systems implemented in compliance with the CMS meaningful use program. more recent articles also synthesize lessons and implementation strategies at the local level for ELR, IIS, and other meaningful use related information systems. the theme of telemedicine remains the largest portion of GHI-related literature. telemedicine applications bridge healthcare delivery needs when providers and specialists are not physically present in a specific region. some studies evaluated mobile survey platforms, generally acknowledging the value of this technology for survey distribution. the literature also described mobile applications used to improve specific clinical activities. the final major theme, eHealth, focuses on the development, use and impact of electronic health record systems on LMICs. Count of articles based on study methodology stratified by year of publication. themes arose during discussion of the articles were assessments of infrastructure needed for system implementation and readiness of an environment. topics included measuring system and power outage and security and privacy enhancements. reviewers also identified an additional theme related to emergency services supported by information systems in LMICs [125-127]. synthesis of PHI Studies PHI articles focus on a wide range of information systems. 43 articles used a quantitative methodology. just nine articles employed a controlled experimental or comparative design. twelve articles were even more exploratory in nature. fourteen articles describe information systems deployed or used by hospitals or health systems. three studies examined information systems in hospitals used by infection preventionists to monitor and control outbreaks within a hospital or health system. the theme of telemedicine remains the largest portion of literature. telemedicine applications bridge healthcare delivery needs when providers and specialists are not physically present in a specific region. telemedicine has also been a source for access to specialists in fields, such as dermatology and pediatric cardiology. some studies evaluated mobile survey platforms, generally acknowledging the value of this technology for survey distribution [73-88] the final major theme, eHealth, focuses on the development, use and impact of electronic health record (EHR) systems on LMICs. the largest category of articles included a mix of various primary studies. themes that arose during our discussion of the articles were assessments of infrastructure needed for system implementation and readiness of an environment, such as a clinical facility or a group of system users. a total of 85 PHI articles and 282 GHI articles were identified through a search of the available literature and suggestions from AMIA working group members. the selected articles suggest growth with respect to both implementation of information systems within the public health enterprise as well as a widening of scope within each informatics discipline. the last few years have witnessed a global recession with shrinking public health budgets and a sharp decline in funds allocated to public health preparedness. the last few years have witnessed a global recession with shrinking public health budgets and a sharp decline in funds allocated to public health preparedness. despite a change in search methodology, we observed similar patterns across all publication years. we believe there is true growth in the development, implementation and use of ICT in LMICs across the globe. despite growth in articles many studies continue to focus on implementation rather than outcomes. there exists a growing body of implementation science literature in the developed world [165,166], which would be strengthened by contributions from LMICs. many studies involve partners from multiple universities, research institutes, and countries with diverse funding streams. public health informatics At the turn of the twenty-first century, PHI efforts around the world were characterized by a focus on the core public health function of monitoring populations. the threat of a large-scale epidemic has not diminished in recent years, as evidenced in 2014 by MERS [133,134] and Ebola [135] the scope of PHI has broadened to support the full range of functions performed by public health authorities. the focus of GHI research intersects at the crossroads of clinical and public health informatics in the context of LMICs. recent articles reflect an increase in the development, implementation and use of telemedicine, mHealth, EHR, and other forms of healthcare ICT in LMICs on all continents. the literature suggests that the use of ICT will continue to expand in LMICs. this will likely generate new studies on their impact on patient and population health. more rigorous review and synthesis will provide stronger evidence that many policymakers seek as they contemplate policies. our review was limited to peer-reviewed articles indexed in MEDLINE. this limited our ability to identify relevant articles published in newer journals or journals which do not meet scientific scope. this query in 2013 returned 392 results, with 20 articles meeting the criteria for full review. the group feels the query is not sensitive enough to capture \u201cinformation system\u201d articles that fail to use the term \u201cinformatics\u201d.
