{"summary": "the highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) isolate HuN4 (GenBank Accession No. EF635006) and the classic PRRSV isolate CH-1a (GenBank Accession No. AY032626) were provided by the PRRS research group of the National Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology (Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Harbin, China) all viruses were used at a multiplicity of infection that resulted in a 50% infection rate in PAM or MARC-145 cells were grown to 90% confluence in sterile cell culture flasks and gently detached using a scraper. cells were plated in triplicate at a density of 1.5 106 cells/well in Costar 12-well plates (Corning Inc., Ithaca, NY, U.S.A.) to generate M1 PAMs. all experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated at least three times. indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) PAMs were fixed with cold methanol-acetone (3:7) for 20 min at 20\u00b0C, washed three times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). the protein concentration was then determined by using a bicinchoninic acid assay kit. equal amounts of each sample were separated by SDS-PAGE. membranes were incubated with anti-PRRSV N protein mouse monoclonal antibody SDOW17 (1:10,000, RTI) at 37\u00b0C. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase served as an endogenous control. the specific primers used are listed in Table 1. Table 1. Quantitative RT-PCR primers. anti-pig macrophage monoclonal antibody (MAb) clone BA4D5 (AbD Serotec, Kidlington, U.K.), FITC-conjugated mouse anti-TLR4 (Abcam, Cambridge, U.K.) and APC-conjugated anti-arginase 1 (R&D Systems) nitrite concentration was measured as an indicator of NO production using the Griess reaction. urea production was measured by the absorbance at 540 nm and normalized to total protein content. the HP-PRRSV strain was serially diluted 10-fold in medium. 100 l of each dilution was added into six wells. Statistical analysis All experiments were performed with at least three independent replicates. data were analyzed with SPSS 16.0 and GraphPad Prism software (version 5.0) MARC-145 cells were maintained in minimal essential medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine and antibiotics in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37\u00b0C. cells were grown to 90% confluence in sterile cell culture flasks and gently detached using a scraper. multiple aliquots of culture supernatants were collected at 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 hr post-infection. supernatants were thawed and analyzed for viral content. all experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated at least three times. western blots were infected with PRRSV at an MOI of 0.1. cells were collected and lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (Beyotime Co., Shanghai, China), supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. the protein concentration was then determined by using a bicinchoninic acid assay kit. quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed as previously described [29] for quantitative analysis of PRRSV in tissues. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) served as an endogenous control. TCACCACCTTCT Flow cytometry analysis was performed on an Accuri C6 flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson, Mountain View, CA) the data were analyzed using Expo 32 software (Becton-Dickinson), and the data were analyzed using Expo 32 software (Becton-Dickinson) nitrite concentration was measured as an indicator of NO production using the Griess reaction. urea production was measured by the absorbance at 540 nm and normalized to total protein content. the HP-PRRSV strain was serially diluted 10-fold in medium. 100 l of each dilution was added into six wells. s were labeled with calcein-AM (2.5 M; Calbiochem) for 60 min at 37\u00b0C, fixed with 80% methanol (5 min, 4\u00b0C) and spun down onto glass slides using a cytospin. s were stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Sigma) prior to imaging. the morphology of (M1) IFN-/LPS- and (M2) IL-4-treated PAMs was examined by confocal microscopy. the morphology of (M1) IFN-/LPS- and (M2) IL-4-treated PAMs was examined by confocal microscopy. qRT-PCR analysis to determine optimal stimulation procedure for macrophage polarization. mRNA levels of genes of M1- and M2-type AM were monitored by qRT-PCR analysis following treatment with various concentrations of LPS/IFN- or IL-4. iNOS is an important factor expressed in M1 mouse macrophages that catalyzes the production of nitric oxide (NO) from L-arginine substrate. no significant changes in NO concentrations were measured in culture supernatants of M1, M2 and control macrophages. a significant increase in the M2 genes IL-10 and Arg-1 in M2-polarized macrophages as compared to M0 and M1 PAMs. expression of M1 TLR4 and M2 Arg-1 was notably higher LPS/IFN- and IL-4-stimulated PAM, respectively, when compared to control cells. qRT-PCR and viral titer analysis (TCID50) showed that viral replication in control PAM progressively increased, pe M1-type cells were infected 48 hr after polarization. no inhibitory effects on PRRSV replication were observed. HP-PRRSV and CH-1a strain of PRRSV were altered in cells with different activation status. compared with untreated PAMs (M0-type), PAMs with IL-4 stimulation showed a decreased cell population that was permissive to infection of both PRRSV strains. cells infected with the HuN4-F2 strain (A) of HP-PRRSV or CH-1a strain (B) of PRRSV were fixed and labeled using anti-N protein antibody (green) nuclei were detected with DAPI (blue) Scale bar, 200 m. total RNA was isolated from cells infected with the HuN4-F2 strain (C) of HP-PRRSV. PAMs were incubated for 24 hr in RPMI medium in the presence of IFN-/LPS or IL-4. cells were then fixed and labeled using calcein-AM (green) morphology of (M1) IFN-/LPS- and (M2) IL-4-treated PAMs was examined by confocal microscopy. qRT-PCR analysis to determine optimal stimulation procedure for macrophage polarization. mRNA levels of genes of M1- and M2-type AM were monitored by qRT-PCR analysis following treatment with various concentrations of LPS/IFN- or IL-4. PPAR- and STAT6 expression was markedly higher in IL-4-simulated M2 PAMs. iNOS is an important factor expressed in M1 mouse macrophages that catalyzes the production of nitric oxide (NO) from L-arginine substrate. IL-10-stimulated PAMs were compared to control and M1 samples. expression of M1 TLR4 and M2 Arg-1 was notably higher LPS/IFN-- and IL-4-stimulated PAM. treatment with LPS/IFN- or IL-4 potently induces M1 or M2 polarization in PAMs. TCID50 and MAC145 assays revealed a significant decrease in viral protein expression and infection rate in M1 macrophages. no inhibitory effects on PRRSV replication were observed in M1-type cells. replication of different PRRSV strains was altered in cells with different activation status. compared with untreated PAMs (M0-type), PAMs with IL-4 stimulation showed no significant change in the population of permissive cells. cells infected with the HuN4-F2 strain (A) of HP-PRRSV or CH-1a strain (B) of PRRSV were fixed and labeled using anti-N protein antibody (green) nuclei were detected with DAPI (blue) scale bar, 200 m. morphology of human macrophages changes with different maturation and activation methods in vitro. previous studies showed that LPS/IFN- stimulation causes macrophages to stretch through cytoskeletal arrangements and modulates macrophage elasticity. these results suggest that LPS/IFN- increase phagocytosis through effects on macrophage elasticity (morphology) the observed effect on PRRSV replication in M1-type macrophages results from the decreased expression of viral receptors on the PAM surface. however, when M1-type cells were infected 48 hr after polarization, no inhibitory effects on PRRSV replication were observed. however, when M1-type cells were infected 48 hr after polarization, no inhibitory effects on PRRSV replication were observed. PRRSV infection can modulate macrophage polarization. we established a PAM polarization model in vitro and confirmed similarities in cytokine expression as previously observed in mouse and human macrophages."}
