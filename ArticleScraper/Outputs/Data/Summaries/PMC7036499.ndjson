{"summary": "in 2003, the outbreak of the serious infectious disease severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) took place in china, which was extremely horrible due to its spread and high death rate. according to statistics, 5327 residents in mainland china were infected with SARS, of which 349 died. at the same time, 665 cases were infected in Taiwan, china, of which 180 died. in the united states, even if the flu outbreak is not so severe, the death toll may reach 56 000, of which 80% are elderly. the main reason for the high infection and deaths due to flu may be attributed to the nonfeasance of government because took no effective measures were taken against the spread of the infectious disease. based on the Kermack and McKendrick model, Metcalf and Lessler3 analyzed both the opportunities and the challenges in the control of infectious diseases. recently, the effects of insecticide on infectious diseases are analyzed. the average effective contact (transferable) with other people for a person in a unit time is ; the number of people who are cured within the unit time is ; the treatment cost is ; and the government compensation is. the number of people cured in a unit time is determined by the cost of treatment and government compensation. the number of people at each stage is S ( t ) = S t, I ( t ) = I t, and R ( t ) = R t. the initial setting is S 0 = 0. 4, I 0 = 0. 4, R 0 = 0. 2,. the cost of treatment has an important impact on the transmission of infectious diseases. at high cost, even after 10 000 times of simulation, the number of infected people will drop to zero after about 1774 periods. the cost of treatment has an important impact on the transmission of infectious diseases. the horizontal axis is the number of time periods, and the vertical axis indicates the number of people in each period. the initial setting is S 0 = 0. 4, I 0 = 0. 4, R 0 = 0. 2, and = 1 and 2000 times of simulation. the total number of social treatments and the total cost were further analyzed. the government compensates people to control the disease, but compensation for the government supply will only be enough for people to treat infectious diseases. if = 0, then = 1 means higher expenditures for the government. numerical simulation of the number of infected people in different parameters. the impact of treatment cost on the evolution of infectious diseases was captured by comparing the results between no subsidy and full subsidy. the proportion of infected people still exceeds 50%, and the highest number of infected people is close to 80%. if the government implements full subsidy for infectious disease, the number of infected people will drop rapidly and will fall to zero in the eighth period. the initial setting is S 0 = 0. 4, I 0 = 0. 4, R 0 = 0. 2, and = 1 and 10 000 times of simulation. at high cost, even after 10 000 times of simulation, the number of infected people will drop to zero after about 1774 periods. the cost of treatment has an important impact on the transmission of infectious diseases. the cost for high-cost treatments was close to infinity. the number of low-cost treatments was 1654.48, and the cost of treatment was 8272.40. when treatment costs are low, the government does not have to intervene. the number of infected people drops rapidly and will reach zero in the eighth period. the total cost of treatment is related to unit person treatment cost, which is 55.88 at high cost and 27.94 at low cost. the impact of treatment cost on the evolution of infectious diseases was captured by comparing the results between no subsidy and full subsidy. the results are shown in Figure 4; for more details on the numerical simulation, please see the appendix. government intervention has an important impact on the evolution of infectious diseases. if the government implements full subsidy for infectious disease, the number of infected people will drop rapidly and will fall to zero in the eighth period. without government reimbursement, this article finds that high expenditures accelerate the disease infection."}
