{"summary": "the world\u2019s nine warmest years in the time period from 1850 to 2017 have all occurred in the last twelve years. this ostensibly small increase in average global temperature is responsible for significant changes in the worldwide weather patterns. over the past 70 years, the overall annual average temperature in Canada has increased by 1.8\u00b0C (4), with an average winter temperature increase of 3.4\u00b0C (4). climate change is influencing the mobility patterns of people and goods. refugees, often from geographical areas where infectious diseases are more common and with different vaccination schedules and practices, may inadvertently bring these diseases into Canada. tourism is also affected by climate change, as changes in both home and travel destinations influence the push and pull of factors motivating people to travel. the more quickly signals from an evolving outbreak are identified, the more quickly the outbreak can be tracked and a public health response can be planned and implemented (27). the more quickly signals from an evolving outbreak are identified, the more quickly the outbreak can be tracked and a public health response can be planned and implemented (27). artificial intelligence algorithms in GPHIN automate a stream of two to three thousand news articles per day that are moderated by 12 expert analysts who identify and issue alerts for threats using tacit contextual information. Unlike ProMED, GPHIN benefits from multi-staged filtering using AI and trained analysts. fully automated systems include the European Commission\u2019s Medical Information System (MedISys), Pattern-based Understanding and Learning System (PULS) and HealthMap. the EBS systems use natural language processing (NLP) methods to process and understand event narratives (46\u201348) natural language processing is a field of research dedicated to understanding human discourse. early methods include the sub-language approach, where rules and patterns are used to interpret and classify vocabulary, syntax and semantics of the unstructured narrative. taxonomic classification of narratives can identify health-related articles by searching for related terms. information flow from open-source internet data in event-based surveillance systems is presented in Table 2. ML algorithms filter and classify events based on their metadata. sex, location, date of onset, hospitalized. Statistical inference is a well-rounded and informative risk modelling approach. the method is used to determine how risk factors (explanatory variables) are associated with the outcome of interest (e.g. number of reported cases) data from open-source internet data includes regression analysis. the compartmental modelling approach has more recently developed to simulate transmission dynamics among multiple populations. this requires the inclusion of mobility data to define the rate of individuals moving among populations. this requires the inclusion of mobility data to define the rate of individuals moving among populations. taxonomic classification of narratives can identify health-related articles. the sublanguage approach for identifying health-related data in EBS systems is effective but also has drawbacks. the sublanguage approach for identifying health-related data in EBS systems is effective but also has drawbacks. a summary of information flow from data collection, processing, analytics and reporting for EBS systems is presented in Table 2. information flow from open-source internet data in event-based surveillance systems is presented in Table 2. ML algorithms filter and classify events based on their metadata. regression models and statistical inference are developing to include information from open-source internet data. the resulting model was then used to predict the number of seasonal influenza cases one to two weeks into the future. however, this approach was not as effective in predicting outbreaks outside of the traditional flu season because of associations being identified with search query trends not related to seasonal influenza. human mobility at a meta-population level can be considered as the movement of people in a connected network of cities and countries. this requires the inclusion of mobility data to define the rate of individuals moving among populations (62). this requires the inclusion of mobility data to define the rate of individuals moving among populations (62). there are gaps in internet and mobile phone use in africa (67); the propensity of people using Twitter to report illnesses is dependent on age and socioeconomic status (68). advances in risk modelling approaches include integrating open-source internet and climate data to inform these estimates, and accounting for the mobility of humans to spread infectious diseases globally. advances in assessing changes to vector and reservoir populations and human activity are now being monitored by a number of different surveillance and analytical strategies. event-based surveillance systems use open-source data to gather information relating to infectious diseases. these systems can be moderated, partially moderated or fully automated."}
