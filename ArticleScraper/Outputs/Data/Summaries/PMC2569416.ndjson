{"summary": "recombinant adenoviruses have been shown to elicit significant immune responses to bacterial (anthrax, plague), viral (Hepatitis C, Rabies, SARS) and tumour-associated antigens [1]\u2013[3]. immunity eventually develops against virus capsid proteins. this severely reduces the immunogenicity of adenovirus-based vaccines in mice, [4]\u2013[8], primates [9] and humans [10] recombinant adenoviruses are one of the few well-studied vectors currently under development for vaccination against Ebola virus infection. the first protocol for an Ebola vaccine employed a prime-boost regimen consisting of naked DNA expressing either Ebola glycoprotein (GP) or nucleoprotein (NP) systemic and mucosal T and B cell responses to Ebola GP were assessed in both nave mice and those with pre-existing immunity. the influence of PEGylation of the vaccine carrier on the immune response after oral immunization is also described. purified virus was administered in sterile phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4) and had particle to plaque forming unit (pfu) ratios of 1001 or less. protein content of the virus preparation was determined using bioRad DC protein assay reagents. mice were immunized with 11010 particles of recombinant virus per mouse. for nasal immunization, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane. pre-existing immunity to adenovirus serotype 5 was established by injecting 51010 particles of adenovirus expressing beta-galactosidase (AdlacZ) the animals were weighed daily for 13 days and monitored for clinical signs of Ebola infection using an approved scoring sheet. all infectious work was performed in the \u2018Biosafety Level 4\u2019 facility at PHAC. gA antibodies, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid was collected in situ with a 20-gauge catheter inserted into the proximal trachea. BAL from each animal was incubated at 56\u00b0C for 45 minutes. two-fold serial dilutions were added to 96 well plates pre-coated overnight with 30 ng of ZEBOV-like particles per well. antibody titers were calculated as the highest dilution at which 50% of the cells stained blue by visual inspection. splenocytes were harvested and cultured for 5 hours at 37\u00b0C. a 96-well ELISPOT plate was coated with 5 g/ml anti-mouse IFN- capture antibody. control cells were incubated either without peptide or with the non-specific stimulator, SEB (200 ng/ml) recombinant virus was sequentially amplified to large-scale infections (5108 cells) and purified on an affinity column (Adeno-X virus purification mega kit, BD Clonetech, Mountain View, CA) the virus was administered in sterile phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4) PEGylated preparations were administered in sterile potassium phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4) and had particle to plaque forming unit (pfu) ratios of 1001 or less. 13,000 PEG molecules were associated with each virus particle in the studies outlined here as determined by a PEG-biotin assay. mice had an average anti-adenovirus circulating NAB titer of 1320. at the time of vaccination, mice had an average anti-adenovirus circulating NAB titer of 1320. the animals were weighed daily for 13 days and monitored for clinical signs of Ebola infection using an approved scoring sheet. 100 l of DMEM supplemented with 20% FBS was then added to each well. plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 for 48 h. bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid was collected in situ with a 20-gauge catheter inserted into the proximal trachea. serum was incubated at 56\u00b0C for 30 minutes and then diluted in DMEM in twofold increments starting from a 120 dilution. each dilution (100 l) was mixed with an aliquot of a standard stock of adenovirus type 5 expressing E. coli beta-galactosidase (106 pfu), incubated for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C, and applied to HeLa cells in 96-well plates. bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was collected in situ with a 20-gauge catheter inserted into the proximal trachea. two-fold serial dilutions were added to 96 well plates pre-coated overnight with 30 ng of ZEBOV-like particles per well and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 hr. adenovirus type 5 expressing E. coli beta-galactosidase (106 pfu) incubated for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C for 24 hours. antibody titers calculated as the highest dilution at which 50% of the cells stained blue by visual inspection. ELISPOT mouse set was coated with 5 g/ml anti-mouse IFN- capture antibody. cells pooled from 4 B10.BR mice per experimental group were added to microwells along with the TELRTFSI peptide. pre-existing immunity was induced by intramuscular administration of recombinant Ad5 expressing a non-relevant antigen, beta-galactosidase (AdlacZ) at the time of vaccination, mice had an average anti-adenovirus circulating NAB titer of 1320. Nave mice (n = 10) were vaccinated with a single dose of 11010 particles of adenovirus expressing the Ebola Zaire glycoprotein (Ad5-ZGP) by the intramuscular (I.M.), nasal (I.N.) or oral (P.O.) route. animals in which pre-existing immunity was established by I.M. injection of 51010 particles of adenovirus serotype 5 expressing beta-galacto NAB levels equivalent to 4010 reciprocal dilution were detected in nave animals. anti-Ebola NAB could not be detected in samples from mice given the AdlacZ vector alone (AdlacZ Control) uclear cells were detected in splenocytes of nave animals immunized with the AdlacZ vector. a limited number of activated IFN- secreting mononuclear cells were detected in bronchioalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) this was not significantly compromised by pre-existing immunity to adenovirus (12016 SFC/million MNCs, p0.06, Figure 2D). INF- positive cells were found in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) and peyer's patches (PP) only after oral vaccination with Ad-ZGP. pre-existing immunity reduced production of these cells to 1812 SFC/million MNCs (MLN) and 162 SFC/million MNCs (PP) error bars represent the standard deviation of the data. animals immunized with an irrelevant adenoviral vector (AdlacZ) served as negative controls. positive results obtained from this group are indicative of artificial cellular stimulation. PEI - pre-existing immunity to adenovirus serotype 5. bronchioalveolar lavage fluid was analyzed for Ebola-specific IgG and IgA antibodies by ELISA. mice immunized with 11010 particles of adenovirus by intramuscular (I.M.), nasal (I.N.) or oral (P.O.) route. animals had an average anti-adenovirus neutralizing antibody titer of 1320 reciprocal dilution. only mice immunized by the nasal route survived lethal challenge. mice were challenged with 200 LD50 of mouse-adapted Ebola virus (Zaire strain) data represent survival (panel A) and loss of body weight (panel B) over time. naive mice immunized orally survived challenge while none in the I.M.+PEI group survived. pre-existing immunity was induced by I.M. injection with 51010 particles of adenovirus expressing beta-galactosidase (AdlacZ) pre-existing immunity was induced by I.M. injection with 51010 particles of adenovirus expressing beta-galactosidase. characterization of Ebola glycoprotein-specific Ig isotypes revealed that the PEGylated vector could possibly stimulate production of IgG in the presence or absence of pre-existing immunity. modification of the virus induced a slight increase of IgA in the presence of pre-existing immunity. animals with pre-existing immunity to adenovirus and immunized with the PEGylated vaccine orally did not survive after challenge with 200 LD50 of (MA at the time of vaccination, mice had an average anti-adenovirus circulating NAB titer of 1320. oral immunization lowered the response against Ebola glycoprotein (P.O., 20.5%) samples obtained from nave animals immunized by the intramuscular route (I.M.) contained the largest population of IFN- positive CD8+ T cells (102%) mice had an average anti-adenovirus circulating NAB titer of 1320. animals given a single dose of (AdlacZ) served as negative controls. the number of activated IFN- secreting mononuclear cells harvested from splenocytes was significantly reduced by 38 and 59% in mice vaccinated nasally or orally. a very limited number of activated IFN- secreting mononuclear cells were detected in splenocytes of nave animals immunized with the AdlacZ vector. significant levels of INF- positive cells were detected in bronchioalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) after intranasal immunization. this was not significantly compromised by pre-existing immunity to adenovirus (12016 SFC/million MNCs, p0.06, Figure 2D) the frequency of IFN- positive mononuclear cells was analyzed from the spleen (panels A and C), the lung via bronchioalveolar lavage (BAL) and the intestine via the mesenteric lymph nodes. samples were obtained from nave animals (Panels A and B) and those with pre-existing immunity to adenovirus serotype 5 (Panels C and D) bronchioalveloar fluid was analyzed for the presence of neutralizing antibody by measuring the reduction in infectious titer of ZEBOV-EGFP. the reciprocal dilution plotted for each treatment group reflects the dilution at which the ability of the ZEBOV-EGFP vector to infect target cells was reduced by >50%. mice were immunized with 11010 particles of Ad5-ZGP by the intramuscular (I.M.), intranasal (I.N.) or oral (P.O.) route in the presence or absence of pre-existing immunity. only mice immunized by the nasal route survived the lethal challenge. controls and mice immunized by the other routes began to lose weight. all naive mice immunized orally survived challenge while none in the I.M.+PEI group survived. studies suggest that only intranasal immunization can afford protection against Ebola virus in the absence and presence of pre-existing immunity. additional strategies were needed to improve vaccination by either the oral or intramuscular route in the presence of pre-existing immunity. samples from animals given the unmodified virus had levels of 205 reciprocal dilution. characterization of Ebola glycoprotein-specific Ig isotypes revealed that the PEGylated vector could possibly stimulate production of IgG in the presence of pre-existing immunity. mucosal immunity is often the first line of defense against pathogens coming in contact with susceptible hosts. systemic immunization produces strong anti-viral systemic responses. a single intranasal immunization with Ad5-ZGP conferred 100% protection even in the presence of pre-existing immunity. the strength of the immune response generated by this route of administration was quantitatively lower than that seen in animals vaccinated by intramuscular injection. the level of anti-Ebola GP antibodies in the circulation and in the lung was also not significantly compromised by pre-existing immunity to adenovirus. the ability of the wild-type adenovirus to replicate is limited. additional studies are underway in an effort to further define stringent conditions under which pre-existing immunity can be established for experimental testing. each nave animal immunized with a single oral dose of Ad-ZGP survived challenge, giving better precision on the minimal threshold of immunity required to achieve protection. recombinant adenoviral vaccines to either the nasal or intestinal mucosa are an attractive vaccination strategy for many reasons. nasal immunization with recombinant adenovirus-based vaccines can facilitate translocation of the virus to the central nervous system. pre-existing immunity to adenovirus serotype 5 is not impeded by pre-existing immunity to adenovirus serotype 5. further characterization of the immune response against both the encoded antigen and the adenovirus vector in larger, clinically relevant animal models is vital."}
