{"summary": "viral genomic RNA-binding protein plays a key role in virus biology. for many viruses contributes towards the regulation of viral RNA synthesis. these proteins may also interact with host cell proteins to facilitate their activities related to the virus life cycle. IBV N protein is postulated to bind RNA via a lure-and-lock mechanism (15, 16) glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) is the acting kinase for SARS-CoV and MHV N protein. interaction of coronavirus N proteins with host cell factors has not been subjected to extensive study. coronavirus N protein was chosen because both its biophysical properties and subcellular localization to the cytoplasm and nucleolus (40\u201344) have been extensively characterized. phosphate was used to transfect cells with plasmid DNA. per 10-cm2 dish, 500 l of 2 M CaCl2 and 1.5 mM Na2HPO4. solution was added dropwise to 61 l of 2 M CaCl2 and 10 g of DNA. the beads were resuspended in 2 SDS-sample buffer and boiled for 10 min to elute bound proteins. the resulting separated proteins were cut from the gel in 10 slices and subjected to in-gel digestion with trypsin. a sample volume of 10 l was loaded at a constant flow rate of 20 l/min onto a PepMap C18 trap column. full-scan MS survey spectra (m/z 335 to 1,800) in profile mode were acquired in the Orbitrap instrument with a resolution of 60,000 after accumulation of 500,000 ions. the five most intense peptide ions from the preview scan were fragmented by collision-induced dissociation in the LTQ instrument. LC-MS/MS data from this project for the IBV N protein were deposited in the Proteomics Identifications database. IPA networks were generated using data sets containing gene identifiers and expression values. each gene identifier was mapped to its corresponding gene object in the IPKB. transfer between the SDS-polyacrylamide gel and the membrane was performed using a bio-Rad semidry blotting system. after transfer, PVDF membranes were blocked in 10% (wt/vol) skimmed milk powder (Marvel) made up in Tris-buffered saline containing Tween 20. Sucrose gradients were made up in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, and 20 mM EDTA and passed through a 22-m-pore-size filter. the cytoplasmic fraction (200 l) was then centrifuged at 287,000 g in a swinging-bucket rotor for 5 h at 4\u00b0C. vero cells were seeded at a density of 3.8 103 (for 40 to 50% confluence) cells/well in clear 96-well microplates at 24 h prior to small interfering RNA (siRNA) treatment. 24 mg MTT powder was dissolved in 10 ml DMEM (plus 10% [vol/vol] FBS) at 37\u00b0C to make a 10 mM solution. the absorbance at between 425 and 570 nm was 1 l/well Lipofectamine 2000 was mixed with 50 l/well Opti-MEM medium at room temperature for 5 min. dilute oligomers and the dilute Lipofectamine 2000 were then mixed gently and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. control wells of reagent only and medium only were included to assess any background reactivity. cell pellets were incubated for 30 min with 200 l lysis buffer, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, and 1 EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche). cell dissociation buffer (phosphate-buffered saline [PBS] based; Invitrogen) was used instead. the beads were equilibrated with ice-cold dilution buffer and then incubated with diluted cell lysate for 2 h at 4\u00b0C on a rotary mixer. the bead pellet washed once with dilution buffer, followed by a single wash in buffer comprising 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl. peptides were eluted onto a PepMap C18 nanocolumn (75 m by 15 cm; Dionex Corporation) with a linear gradient of 5 to 35% solvent B (90% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid) over 65 min at a constant flow rate of 300 nl/min. full-scan MS survey spectra (m/z 335 to 1,800) in profile mode were acquired in the LTQ instrument with a resolution the derived peak list was searched with the Mascot search engine. SILAC- and extracted ion current-based quantitation, calculation of the posterior error probability, and calculation of a false discovery rate were carried out using the MaxQuant program. the derived peak list was searched against a concatenated database. STRING analysis was performed using version 9 (52) and STRING has been found to be a robust noncommercial algorithm for predicting protein-protein interactions (53). a total of 5 106 cells were used for each experiment. cells were resuspended in 1 ml of cytoplasmic lysis buffer. the samples were then centrifuged at 1,500 g for 2 min. all cell culture experiments in this study were conducted in the absence of antibiotic or antifungal agents. at 60% confluence, cells were infected with IBV and then incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C, after which the cells were incubated in maintenance medium. cells were then processed for analysis at 12 h postinfection. amine 2000 was used to transfect Vero cells with siRNA. cells were seeded at a density of 3 104 in antibiotic-free DMEM at 24 h prior to transfection. DMEM and siRNA were mixed with 50 l well Opti-MEM medium. a 63 objective and a digital zoom factor of 1 to 4 within the software was used to ensure that images were taken wherever possible within the linear range. a SILAC-based quantitative proteomic approach coupled to an immunoprecipitation strategy based on expression of an EGFP-N fusion protein in cells was used. a human cell line was used in this study to provide cellular proteins with potential interaction with N protein. this was due to the superior annotation of the human genome allowing protein identification. 293T cells were also chosen because of their efficiency in taking up exogenous plasmid DNA by calcium phosphate. this was due to their efficiency in taking up exogenous plasmid DNA by fluorescence-activated cell sorting compared to that of vero or DF1 cells, thus allowing higher blot analysis using either an anti-EGFP antibody or an anti-IBV antibody confirmed the expression and immunoprecipitation of EGFP and EGFP-N respectively. the species visualized migrating between the 98- and 64-kDa markers in the anti-GFP and anti-IBV EGFP samples was present in other pulldown samples. 9 12.8 G3BP-2 14.02 11 29.5 RPL31 13.99 3 27.3 RPL13 13.45 2 9 RPS18 13.20 16 69.7 RPS3A 12.23 14 48.9 G3BP-1 12.21 14 38.8 ALYREF 11.94 2 6.8 RPS9 11.89 3 9.3 RPS19 11.55 14 62.1 RPS16 10.67 13 63 RPS5 10.26 11 42.6 RPL24 9.81 4 21.4 RPS8 9.76 8 35 f166 5.91 3 11.9 RPL3 5.83 4 8.9 RBM3 5.76 2 19.1 USP10 5.55 5 9.1 RPL27A 5.51 3 31.1 XRCC6 5.51 15 28.1 DDX21 5.48 13 21.1 RPL9 5.42 5 28.6 NONO 5.42 12 25.3 SFRS1 5.34 6 29.8 RPL27 5.19 2 22.9 SFPQ 5.19 10 17.5 HNRNPD 5.15 9 29.9 R THDF2 3.38 5 10.2 GNB2L1 3.33 13 50.1 HNRNPG 3.30 2 6.6 IGF2BP1 3.29 20 40.2 PTBP1 3.27 11 26.8 PABP4 3.25 30 41.5 DHX36 3.23 6 7 MOV10 3.21 3 3.6 DHX57 3.18 2 1.7 H1FX 3.11 3 21.1 ATXN2L 3.09 3 2.8 FMR1 3.05 3 4.9 DHX15 3. ingenuity pathway analysis was used to investigate whether the identified proteins grouped into distinct functional clusters. independent analysis of the potential network interactions using STRING revealed clustering of proteins into those involved in translation and RNA processing/modification. the eight most abundant proteins in human cells at the time of analysis were recorded as APOA2, RBP4, APOC2, ALB, TTR, APOA1, APOC1, and APOC3. none of these were part of the 142 proteins associated with EGFP-N. this is the 446th most abundant out of 12,797 cellular proteins. no identified proteins were shown to interact with EGFP. some EGFP may be cleaved from EGFP-N, and this may be through the action of caspase. cosedimentation was performed on a 5 to 20% sucrose gradient in the presence of EDTA to induce separation of the large and small ribosomal subunits. migration of these subunits was determined by extraction of RNA from the fractions and running of these on a 1% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide (EtBr) the ribosomal protein L19 localized to both the cytoplasm and the nucleolus both in bystander cells and also in infected cells. the ribosomal protein L19 localized to both the cytoplasm and the nucleolus both in bystander cells and also in infected cells, as would be predicted for a ribosomal protein. a yellow signal suggests an interaction between this protein and EGFP-N protein. in infected cells (green), B23.1 (red) and hnRNPA2/B1 (red) localized not only to the nucleolus and nucleus, but also to the cytoplasm. no relocalization or colocalization with N protein was observed with hnRNPA1 despite capturing the signal for hnRNPA1 beyond the linear range. four target proteins were chosen: RPL19, GSK3/GSK, nucleolin, and procyclic acidic repetitive protein 1 (PARP1) these proteins had EGFP-to-EGFP-N binding ratios of 15.78, 7.60/4.69, 6.58, and 2.5, respectively. Western blotting indicated that the abundance of all four proteins was decreased in the presence of the specific siRNA but not the nontargeting siRNA. qRT-PCR analysis of the abundance of the IBV genomic RNA in either mock-infected cells (mock) or cells treated with the nontarget siRNA or the specific siRNA to the mRNAs encoding the selected protein of interest. the experiment was performed three times in triplicate for each condition. IBV N protein was expressed in 293T cells as part of an EGFP fusion protein (EGFP-N), as previously described (41\u201344), and the GFP-trap system was applied to allow isolation of potential interaction partners from the cell lysates. EGFP alone gave heavy staining between the 28- and 38-kDa marker bands, with a few faint bands being present at different molecular masses under the 150 mM NaCl wash condition. SILAC-labeled samples (R0K0 EGFP, R6K4 EGFP-N) were immunoprecipitated. a 300 mM NaCl concentration was used in the wash buffer. this appeared to yield a decrease in nonspecific binding in the EGFP-N samples. 9.81 4 21.4 RPS8 9.76 8 35.9 RPL26 9.59 8 48.4 RPL22 9.54 4 48.4 YBX1 9.47 9 43 RPS11 9.45 10 54.4 RPS10 9.39 8 33.9 RPS17 9.07 7 65.2 RPS25 9.07 8 46.4 SFRS4 8.94 2 3.2 RPS3 8.92 18 69.1 RPL4 8.74 7 19.7 RPS14 8.54 7 40.4 RPS26 8.40 HNRNPD 5.15 9 29.9 RPL10A 5.15 7 36.5 RPL23A 5.00 3 17 DDX1 4.99 13 24.5 XRCC5 4.97 12 19.7 HNRNPA/B 4.95 8 31.6 SSB 4.89 7 20.1 RPL5 4.79 6 26.6 HNRNPA1 4.69 16 43 GSK3B 4.69 5 15.9 C22orf28 4.60 11 27.5 RPL0 4.53 7 28.4 RPL14 1 3.05 3 4.9 DHX15 3.01 2 2.9 HNRNPH1 3.01 6 19.5 HNRNPF 2.98 3 10.6 H2AFX 2.97 4 37.9 HNRNPK 2.95 12 35.6 ILF2 2.91 3 10.3 DDX6 2.80 2 4.3 LRRC59 2.78 3 11.4 HNRNPM 2.69 10 17.3 HDLBP 2.68 9 8.9 HNRNPH3 2.54 2 8.4 PARP1 2.50 7 8. proteins associated with large (28 proteins) and small (21 proteins) ribosomal subunits, as well as 16 hnRNP proteins with other groups, including the DDX and DHX RNA helicases and kinases GSK3 and GSK3. number in parentheses indicate the number of proteins identified in each grouping. RENT1, which was the least enriched protein out of the 142 selected, is ranked 1,564 out of 12,797. there is no apparent correlation between the abundance of a protein in a cell and its association with N protein. SILAC immunoprecipitation results by immunoblotting. a small aliquot of the input lysate was used in the pulldown assay. a potential interaction between N protein and ribosomal proteins was suggested. EGFP sedimented at the top of the gradient in fractions 9 to 12. a gel containing ethidium bromide (EtBr) allows visualization of the 18S and 28S rRNAs. migration of the EGFP-N protein was determined by immunoblotting. three proteins with some of the highest potential binding ratios were caprin-1, G3BP-1, and G3BP-2. potential relocalization and association of cellular proteins with N protein in IBV-infected cells. the ribosomal protein L19 localized to both the cytoplasm and the nucleolus both in bystander cells and also in infected cells. the ribosomal protein L19 localized to both the cytoplasm and the nucleolus both in bystander cells. no relocalization or colocalization with N protein was observed with hnRNPA1. no relocalization or colocalization with N protein was observed with caprin-1, NONO, or ALY. Western blotting indicated that the abundance of all four proteins was decreased in the presence of the specific siRNA but not the nontargeting siRNA. but the efficiency of ablation was different, with RPL19, PARP1 and GSK3 being the most efficiently depleted. the observed decreased abundance of N protein was not due to any gross effects on cell viability. the experiment was performed three times in triplicate for each condition. qRT-PCR analysis of the abundance of the IBV genomic RNA in either mock-infected cells (mock) or cells treated with the nontarget siRNA or the specific siRNA to the mRNAs encoding the selected protein of interest. ribosomal proteins were not the top proteins with binding to HRSV NS1 or NS2. ribosomal proteins were not the top proteins with binding to either HRSV NS1 or NS2. a decrease in the abundance of N protein and a reduction in genomic RNA compared to the results for the control treated cells. hnRNPs have previously been reported for other members of the Coronaviridae, including 68, 69. depletion of DDX1 in IBV-infected cells resulted in a reduction of IBV replication (61). cellular proteins identified as interacting with the IBV N protein have also shown to be essential cofactors in the replication of other RNA viruses."}
