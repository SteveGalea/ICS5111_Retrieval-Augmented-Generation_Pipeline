{"summary": "the costs of illness associated with noninfluenza infections are estimated at 40 billion USD, including direct and indirect costs. colds comprise a syndrome of symptoms, typically with nasal complaints, cough, sore throat, and sometimes constitutional complaints, like headache, malaise, and fever. the development of effective cold preventives is hampered by the multiplicity of viruses and the complex interplay between host and virus. long-term clinical trials that studied spontaneous colds reported mixed results. three studies on artificially induced rhinovirus infections showed a trend toward preventing symptomatic cold episodes by Echinacea [19\u201321] a good safety profile is mandatory for therapies that are designed to be taken over several months. the study was registered under the Eudra-CT number, 2009-012297-12. from October to November 2009, healthy participants were included in the study. each participant received medication to cover 1 month of treatment and a diary for daily recordings of adverse reactions. participants returned each month to the study center, and returned any unused medication and the completed diaries. participants swallowed 3 0.9 mL per day for illness prevention. this corresponded to 2400 mg of extract per day. each single dose was diluted in water and retained in the mouth. randomization code was prepared in block-sizes of 6 with the \u201cRANCODE Professional 3.6\u201d program. each participant received treatment based on his/her identification number. the randomization procedure was prepared by a statistician. AE analysis included all AEs with a date/time of onset on or after the start date of the study treatment. the analysis excluded AEs with a date/time of onset that occurred before the start date or when information on the date/time of onset was missing. the alternative hypothesis was to show non-inferiority by determining that the proportion of patients with ADRs in the Echinaforce group (E) would be lower than the proportion of patients with ADRs in the placebo group (P) plus delta (i.e., HA: E P + ). the alternative hypothesis was accepted when the upper 95% confidence limit (two-sided) of the difference in proportions between Echinaforce and placebo was lower than delta. three predefined prophylactic variables were analyzed individually with a chi-square test. the primary efficacy analysis focused on episodes with durations 9 days. the primary efficacy analysis focused on episodes with durations 9 days. za virus 1\u20134, human Metapneumovirus, Entero-rhinovirus, Adenovirus, and human Bocavirus were compared to the underlying group sizes using a chi-square test. all statistical analyses were performed with the SAS system (Version 9.2) and Testimate 6.4 (IDV, Datenanalyse und Versuchsplanung, Gauting/M\u00fcnchen) Echinacea was prepared by alcoholic extraction from freshly harvested E. purpurea with a combination of 95% herba (DER = 1 : 12) and 5% roots (DER = 1 : 11) the sample was microbiologically tested and proven to be free of endotoxins. Placebo drops were similar in shape, color, consistency, odor, flavor, and they contained the same amount of alcohol. randomization participants were randomly allocated to receive treatment or placebo. the randomization code was prepared in block-sizes of 6 with the \"RANCODE Professional 3.6\" program. participants were randomly allocated to receive treatment or placebo. 15 recipients of placebo (39%) and 17 (42%) with verum said they did not know which preparation they were given. the upper limit of the observed one-sided 97.5% confidence interval of the difference between the placebo proportion, P, and the Echinaforce proportion, E, was expected to be less than 0.1 with 86% power. primary analysis was performed on the basis of the per protocol population. participants provided blood samples to determine clinical chemistry, hematology parameters, and differential blood cell counts. the final safety criterion was the assessment of therapy tolerability. a cold episode was defined as a minimal total symptom score of 14. the participants believed they had a cold and/or reported rhinorrhea that lasted for 3 days. a chi-square statistic was rejected when the chi-square statistic was >3.84. samples were inserted into a transport vial and stored at the study site at 70\u00b0C. RNA was isolated from the nasal secretions using MagMax Express 96 Nucleic Acid Extractor (Applied BioSystems), screened with a Respiratory Virus Panel. results A total of 755 study subjects were screened and allocated into one of the treatment groups. participants in the placebo group were significantly less susceptible to infections than those in the Echinacea group. there was no noticeable difference between groups in anamnestic variables, including blood pressure or heart rate. a total of 293 AEs were reported by 177 subjects treated with Echinaforce. 306 AEs were reported by 172 subjects in the placebo group. no severe AE was observed with Echinaforce. no abnormalities were found after the 4-month exposure to Echinaforce. Previously reported safety concerns like induction of allergic reactions, leucopenia, or autoimmune diseases were not observed under Echinacea treatment. a total of 201 nasal secretion samples were collected in the study. 86 in the Echinacea group and 115 in the placebo group. in 128 samples, the presence of a respiratory virus was confirmed. there was no noticeable difference between groups in anamnestic variables. there was no noticeable difference between groups in anamnestic variables. participants in the placebo group were significantly less susceptible to infections. a total of 293 AEs were reported by 177 subjects treated with Echinaforce and 306 AEs were reported by 172 subjects in the placebo group (safety collective) no severe AE was observed with Echinaforce. one severe AE (glandular fever) occurred with placebo, and this required hospitalization. no abnormalities were found after the 4-month exposure to Echinaforce. the placebo group had 188 cold episodes, with a collective duration of 850 episode days. in 128 samples, the presence of a respiratory virus was confirmed. the strongest effect was seen with membranous viruses, like Corona-, Influenza-, Parainfluenza-, Respiratory Syncytial- and Metapneumovirus. in total, 14 recurring viral infections occurred under Echinacea, i.c. to 34 under placebo. the study was designed and large enough to show preventive efficacy with sufficient power. it is assumed that the typical adult spends up to 2 years over a lifetime with cold symptoms. no specific preventive treatment has been developed to date that has a tolerable safety profile for use over the long term. in the present study, two covariates confounded the reported outcome significantly. participants in the Echinacea group had a higher susceptibility to colds than those in the placebo group. participants in the Echinacea group reported less frequent use of classical pain medications. long-term treatment with Echinacea over 4 months appeared to be beneficial for many reasons. prolonged treatment with Echinaforce was associated with significant therapeutic benefits."}
