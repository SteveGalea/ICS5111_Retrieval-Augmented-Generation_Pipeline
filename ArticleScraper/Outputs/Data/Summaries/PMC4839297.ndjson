{"summary": "the virus is a member of the genus flaviviruses, Family Flaviviridae. it is a positive sense, single-stranded RNA virus and a member of the genus flaviviruses, family flaviviridae. the virus is wide spread in Africa, the Middle east and Russia. replicons harbor luciferase or GFP alone [14] or replicons with luciferase and Neor reporters [15]. first HT screen of WNV consisted of diverse set of 200 compounds in which triaryl pyrazoline was identified as an inhibitor of viral RNA synthesis [17]. a small library of 108 compound pyrolizines were identified. we tested complete DMEM, MEM-E with or without non-essential amino acids (NEAA) and MEM-E with reduced NaHCO3 (1.3 g/L) we did not find a significant difference among the three MEM-E based media with regard to luminescence. but cytopathic effect (CPE) was more evident in cells grown and infected with WNV in MEM-E than in DMEM. the efficacy of the positive control compound, mycophenolic acid (MPA), varied depending on infectious dose. at MOI 0.04, MPA showed 30% protection without decreasing Z\u2032 value. the top 110 inhibitory compounds were evaluated in a dose response assay using the identical screen. the secondary assay revealed 24 compounds with a dose dependent response and fifteen of those compounds showed EC50 values less than 30 M. three compounds, however, were cytotoxic with low CC50 values ranging from 16.21 to 36.75 M. the compounds selected by the primary and dose response screening were re-supplied from the suppliers as a solid form except 4 compounds. serially diluted compounds were added to vero E6 cells at -1, 4, 8 and 18 h post-infection. a similar pattern was seen with the positive control (MPA) EC50 calculated as described in the text. other compounds showed sudden increase in EC50 between 8 and 18 h post-infection. the titer of the progeny virus produced in the presence of the compounds was measured in TCID50 format. infection of vero E6 cells using a 0.1 MOI resulted in around 3.3 109 TCID50/mL in two days post-infection. titer was measured as TCID50/mL. each data point represents the mean from experiments performed in duplicate. all compounds with weak correlation in the correlation analysis have turned out to be \u201creplication dependent\u201d in the time of addition assay.

Z\u2032 values ranged from 0.54\u20130.83 with a median of 0.74. average S/B was 17 and S/N for each plate ranged from 10.8 to 23.9 with a mean of 16.94. ten compounds showed an SI50 (Selectivity Index 50, ratio of CC50 to EC50) >5. the compounds selected by the primary and dose response screening were re-supplied from the suppliers as a solid form. MR000394098, SMR000059052, SMR000027739 and SRI-4578 were not available at that time. serially diluted compounds were added to vero E6 cells at -1, 4, 8 and 18 h post-infection. seventeen compounds showed EC50 values less than 30 M and 5 compounds were not active. EC501hr EC504hr EC508hr EC5018hr MPA, SRI-12784 increase. NS3 protease is an important enzyme responsible for the maturation of viral proteins at early stage during the replication of virus in the host cells. titer of the progeny virus produced in the presence of the compounds was measured as 0.44 M. infection of vero E6 cells using a 0.1 MOI resulted in around 3.3 109 TCID50/mL in two days post-infection. correlation analysis have turned out to be \u201creplication dependent\u201d in the time of addition assay. the endpoint we developed and employed in the HT screen was CPE caused by viral replication. a CPE based antiviral screen is expected to elucidate a wider range of antiviral compounds than other target based assays.

MPA was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. (St. Louis, USA) and solubilized in 100% DMSO to a 5 mg/mL stock concentration. high-throughput Screen Vero E6 cells were suspended in complete MEM-E at 400,000 cells/mL and dispensed at 15 L into black, clear-bottom, tissue culture treated, 384-well plates. cells were maintained overnight at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2 in an actively humidified incubator. each plate consisted of 32 wells representing the Cell control, 24 wells for Virus control, 8 wells for positive control, and 320 wells for testing individual compounds. a ten point, two-fold dilution series of compound concentrations ranging from 30 M to 0.059 M were used in the assay. the plates were incubated 96 h in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 \u00b0C. cell viability was measured as stated above. a recombinant NS3 protease expressed and purified from E.coli with the cofactor NS2b (residues 49-96) and a fluorescence resonance energy transfer based assay kit were purchased from AnaSpec Inc (CA, USA) the assay was performed in a 384-well format with 10 ng/well of NS2b-NS3pro enzyme. the TCID50 was calculated with the numbers of positive infection and negative infection by the Reed-Muench method [26]. 3.1. Cells and Virus All work with WNV was performed at BSL-3 following CDC guidelines. the stock concentrations of both compound sets were 10 mM in 100% DMSO. in the single dose primary screen, the stock compounds were diluted 1:100 in a 10 solution using the Biomek FX giving a 100 M working concentration in 1% DMSO. a 3 L aliquot of the working concentration plus an additional 2 L of assay media was transferred into each well. each entire plate represents one of the ten concentrations in the dilution series. the final test concentrations for the dose response screen were 30 M, 15 M, 7.5 M, 3.75 M, 1.875 M, 0.9375 M, 0.4688 M, 0.2344 M, 0.1172 M, and 0.0586 M all at 0.3% DMSO. dilution series of compound concentrations ranging from 30 M to 0.059 M were used in the assay. a ten point, two-fold dilution series of compound concentrations ranging from 30 M to 0.059 M were used. mean cell control signal (c) minus mean virus control signal (v) divided by the (standard deviation of the cell control signal (c)2)1/2. effective concentration at which the drug inhibited cell death at 50% in the presence of virus (EC50) and the cytotoxicity of the drug alone at 50% (CC50) were calculated using ActivityBase software (IDBS, Inc, Guildford, UK) progeny virus titer was measured by TCID50 assay in 384-well plate format with 6 wells per dilution of virus. a well with a luminescence signal less than the mean of the non-infected control signal was regarded as a positive infection."}
