{"summary": "sepsis, viral infection, extracorporeal circulatory support and outcome after cardiopulmonary arrest are particular problems. hypotensive, catecholamine-resistant shock is increasingly recognized as a cause of death in the post-resuscitation period. septic shock is resistant to inotropic therapy. the authors suggested that AVP may be of use in septic shock in the ELBW population. but a question remains as to the mechanism of action of AVP. the mortality in MD in developed countries is close to 10%. in developing countries, it is as high as 50%. the clinical presentation of MD varies from mild illness to septic syndrome. Arginine-vasopressin (AVP) and terlipressin (TP) are capable of improving blood pressure but not without adverse effects such as limb gangrene. action of AVP is mediated via two receptors, vascular V1, leading to arterial vasoconstriction, and renal tubular V2. a synthetic analog of AVP with a longer half-life was tested in a multicentre study. children presenting with catecholamine-resistant septic shock were enrolled for rescue therapy. TP induced a fast and stable rise in blood pressure; the mean blood pressure increased from 50.5 to 77 mmHg 30 minutes after administration. mortality in MD is close to 10%; in developing countries, it is as high as 50%. the clinical presentation of MD varies from mild illness to septic syndrome with meningitis. diagnostic methods Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) leading to respiratory failure is an important cause of admission for PIC. the cause of illness in these cases may be difficult to establish, but most are believed to be due to respiratory viruses. the cause of illness in these cases may be difficult to establish, but most are believed to be due to respiratory viruses. the need for a rapid diagnosis is an ongoing discussion in the literature [12,13]. highest values of pro-thrombotic fractions were observed at the end of CPB. early postoperative TFPI levels were significantly lower (p 0.01) and TxB2 levels were significantly higher (p 0.05) in paediatric CPB, there is a transient imbalance in coagulation which is more significant in those undergoing TCPC. the most frequent, non-shockable cardiac rhythms seen during arrest in children are asystole and pulseless activity. if shockable rhythms are evident at presentation, outcome is better than when they develop during resuscitation. VF or PVT was the first documented rhythm in 19 patients. the highest values of pro-thrombotic fractions (fragment 1+2 from prothrombin, thromboxane B2 [TxB2] and MCP-1) were observed at the end of CPB. early postoperative TFPI levels were significantly lower (p 0.01) and TxB2 levels were significantly higher (p 0.05) in paediatric CPB. 92 patients had psychomotor assessments performed. 26% exhibited motor difficulties and 14% had cognitive delay. most frequent, non-shockable cardiac rhythms seen during arrest in children are asystole and pulseless activity. ECMO = extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; LRTI = extremely low birth weight; LRTI = lower respiratory tract infection; MCP-1 = monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 alpha; NE/E = norepinephrine/epinephrine; PIC = paediatric intensive care; PVT = pulseless ventricular tachycardia; ROSC = return to spontaneous circulation; RSV = respiratory syncytial virus; RT-PCR"}
