{"summary": "quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) is one of the most powerful tools for this purpose. cDNA microarray and quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) have become the most important and reliable tools to study differential gene expression in fish. RT-PCR combines advantages of specificity, sensitivity, speed, throughput and reproducibility. a common strategy to overcome this problem is to simultaneously amplify a non-regulated housekeeping gene with those targeted to allow quantitative normalization of the experimental cDNA inputs. however, expression levels of these genes may vary considerably depending on cell types, tissues, experimental treatments and even under different diseases. the five housekeeping genes were selected based on their previous use as internal controls for gene expression studies. they have roles in different cellular functions, thus reducing the likelihood that they exhibited regulated covariation. the cultures were free of mycoplasma, as determined by qualitative PCR. bacteria pellets were resuspended in the medium appropriate for each cell line. both CHSE-214 and RTS11 cultures were inoculated at a MOI of 1. cells were harvested at 6 h, 24 h and 48 h post-infection. all experiments were carried out using three biological replicates. mycoplasma contamination was absent as tested by amplifying with the primer set MyF1/MyR1 (PCR Mycoplasma Detection Set - TaKaRa Biomedicals Takara Shuzo) five reference genes were selected to reduce the chance of co-regulation. PCR was achieved with 10 min activation and denaturation step at 95\u00b0C. followed by 40 cycles of 30 s at 95\u00b0C, 30 s at the specific annealing temperature, 30 s at 72\u00b0C and 2 s at 74\u00b0C for fluorescence measurement. melting curve analysis were performed to examine the specificity in each reaction tube. EF1A were calculated using the geometric mean of the three most stable genes of each assay as normalization factors. the 2d (in P. salmonis assays) and the 6 h (in IPNV assays) controls as calibrators, respectively. significance was set at P 0.05. salmonis infection showed the characteristic vacuolisation of cells. this CPE was visible in small groups of cells as early as three days after infection. 80% of the population showed CPE. transcriptional levels of potential reference genes measured by QPCR. each mark shows the mean Ct value included standard deviations. stability of gene expression over different samples can be achieved by evaluating qRT-PCR data with statistical algorithms. UBQ and EF1A were the best ranked reference gene candidates. EF1A was a good housekeeping gene for the analysis of infection challenges. ACTB showed a good performance during P. salmonis and IPNV infection. gene expression was normalized by the geometric mean of the three most stable housekeeping genes determined by geNorm in each assay. gene expression was normalized by the geometric mean of the three most stable housekeeping genes determined by geNorm in each assay. TUBA showed increased expression over 48 h in both control and IPNV-treated CHSE-214 cultures. in infected RTS11 cultures, TUBA was downregulated. authors declare that they have no competing interests. NCB revised critically the manuscript for important intellectual content and SHM supervised the study. all authors read and approved the final manuscript."}
