{"summary": "emergence of highly pathogenic human coronavirus in the middle east has sparked interest in human coronaviruses around the world. the highly fatal human severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged from china in 2003. zoonotic transmission can occur by a spillover event from an animal to a human. only country outside of the region with a significant number of cases was Canada, with 251 confirmed cases and 44 deaths. emergences of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have highlighted the Coronaviridae as potentially important human pathogenic viruses. cleocapsid (N), two replicase polyproteins (purple), ORF1a and ORF1b, and unique accessory proteins (red) perform important functions in coronavirus replication and pathogenesis. cleocapsid (N), two replicase polyproteins (purple), ORF1a and ORF1b, and unique accessory proteins (red) dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius) have neutralizing antibodies to MERS-CoV (8). the reservoir for MERS-CoV is currently unknown. dromedary camels have neutralizing antibodies to MERS-CoV. known bat coronaviruses, BtCoV-HKU4 and BtCoV-HKU5 (10), and screening of bats for MERS-CoV-like coronaviruses (ML-CoVs) have been detected. the full MERS-CoV sequence has not been isolated from any bat source. there are no specific anticoronavirus drugs that have been proven effective in vivo. there is a movement toward screening approved drugs against novel viruses in vitro. development of effective vaccination strategy is vital in the fight against emerging infectious diseases of all types. emergences of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV demonstrate the importance of the Coronaviridae as emerging human pathogens. emergence of MERS-CoV nearly 10 years later has shown that highly pathogenic coronaviruses will continue to spill over from zoonotic sources into the human population."}
