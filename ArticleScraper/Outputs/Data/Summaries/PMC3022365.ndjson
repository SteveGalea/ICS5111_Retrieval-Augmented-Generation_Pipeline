{"summary": "Gastrointestinal pathology was assessed in three separate strains of SHIP-deficient mice and their respective wild-type (WT) littermates. SHIP-deficient mice developed segmental, transmural pyo-granulomatous ilietis. ileitis results from a local deficit in mucosal T cell immunity that promotes a damaging granulocyte\u2013monocyte inflammation of the distal ileum. SHIP controls the homeostasis of immunoregulatory myeloid and T lymphoid cells in peripheral lymphoid tissues such as spleen and lymph node. more than 30 susceptibility loci for IBD disturb either intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) barrier homeostasis or immune effector cell functions. primary IEC or immunological defects in genetically susceptible individuals often remain enigmatic. only two animal models spontaneously develop chronic inflammation of the ileum, the SAMP1/Yit mouse24 and the TNFARE mouse. increased IEC paracellular permeability appears to be the primary susceptibility factor in this model. p110 subunit of an enzyme that SHIP opposes, PI3K, is critical for the formation and survival of Treg cells in the periphery. 39 SHIP-deficiency also promotes the inappropriate expansion of myeloid immunoregulatory cells in spleen and lymph nodes. ophilic pneumonia is a cause of shortened life span in various genetically engineered mouse models. 43 Granulocytes are less susceptible to apoptotic signals in SHIP-deficient mice. granulocyte\u2013monocyte infiltrations can be found in the liver, kidney, heart, skeletal muscle, pancreas lymph nodes and thymus. the first CD animal model capable of adoptively transferring CD-like disease to an immunocompetent host. SHIP/ mice were generated by deletion of the promoter and first exon of SHIP via a Cre-LoxP strategy. coronavirus (MHV), mycoplasma pulmonis, paramyxovirus (PVM), parvovirus (MPV, MMV), poliovirus (TMEV) reovirus type 3 (Reo), arterivirus (LCM), adenovirus (MAD1, MAD2), poxvirus (Ectro), rotavirus (EDIM), papovavirus (Poly), and free of Helicobacter sp. each host received 2.4105 SHIP/ T cells and 7.5103 SHIP/ NK cells. the entire alimentary tract, including the oesophagus, stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, caecum, and colon was evaluated. the entire alimentary tract was insufflated with 10% neutral-buffered formalin. inflammatory grade 2=moderate predominantly PMN leucocyte infiltrations (>25 cells/hpf) of the lamina propria and/or enteric lymph nodule. inflammatory grade 3=marked inflammatory cell infiltrations with extension below the muscularis mucosa causing architectural distortion of the mucosa and submucosa. SHIP expression is ablated in these mice following three intraperitoneal injections of polyI/C at 625/dose. the PI3K haploinsufficient SHIP/ mice were sacrificed 4\u20135 weeks after the last polyI/C injection. BM cells were flushed from intact femur and tibia. they were collected in tissue media (TM) consisting of RPMI, 3% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 10 mM HEPES. the single cell suspension was then filtered through a 70 mm strainer. the skin, subcutis, skeletal muscle, inguinal lymph node and mammary fat pad, cervical lymph node, salivary glands, reproductive tract and associated glands, liver, gall bladder, spleen, pancreas, kidneys and adrenal glands were evaluated. the larynx, trachea with attached thyroid and parathyroid glands, heart, thymus, and lungs were insufflated with 10% neutral-buffered formalin. inflammatory grade 6=marked transmural leucocyte infiltrations with extension into the mesentery and/or other organs. in each section the presence of granuloma, crypt abscess, stricture, fissure, and dissemination of inflammation to other sites was noted. 50 of the 53 (94%) of SHIP-deficient mice had some degree of ileitis, significantly more than the absence of ileitis in WT littermates. both SHIP/ and SHIPIP/IP that harbour deletions in exons encoding different regions in the SHIP1 locus developed ileitis with comparable frequency with 25 of 26 (96%) of SHIP/ mice. grade 2 Crohn's disease-like ileitis of SHIP-deficient mice was comprised of a moderate, mixed, predominantly polymorphonuclear leucocyte infiltration of the ileum. higher magnifications showed a predominantly PMN leucocyte infiltration of the villous lamina propria (F) and within the underlying lymph nodule. grade 4 ileitis was typically sharply delimited aggregates of pyo-granulomatous inflammatory cell infiltrations. multinucleated giant cells (H) and pyo-granulomas (I) were frequently present in affected segments. crypt abscesses (J, arrow) were less frequently observed. most SHIP-deficient mice presented with grade 6 Crohn's disease-like ileitis. the ileum of 9 of the 53 (17%) of the SHIP-deficient mice had grade 1 lesions. this mild, earliest lesion of the SHIP-deficient ileum had progressed in other individual SHIP/ and SHIPIP/IP mice to a moderate (>25 PMN/hpf), mixed, but still PMN leucocyte infiltration of the expanded lamina propria. pyo-granulomas and pyo-granulomas were present in the mucosa, submucosa and/or tunica muscularis. Thickening of the bowel wall due to grade 4 inflammation resulted in lumen narrowing and stricture formation. more SHIP-deficient mice with marked, mixed, transmural inflammatory cell infiltrations of the ileum were assigned inflammatory grade 6 than any other grade. bouring segments of ileum and those of more proximal small intestine or distal large intestine were unaffected. granuloma were present in 15 of 53 (28%) of SHIP-deficient mice. crypt abscesses were observed in 5 of 53 (9%) of SHIP-deficient mice. vascular thrombi and emboli may rarely develop as a consequence of CD-like ileitis in SHIP-deficient mice. this pulmonary consolidation was distinct from that which occurs routinely in SHIP/ and SHIPIPIP mice as an eosinophilic crystalline pneumonia. ileitis occurs in germline SHIP mutant mice, indicating this CD-like pathology may have a developmental origin. eosinophilic crystalline pneumonia in adult mice rendered SHIP deficient. the gastrointestinal tract of the six SHIP/ hosts reconstituted with WT BM lacked any abnormalities including all features of the CD-like ileitis observed in germline SHIP/ and SHIPIP/IP mice. the lungs and intestines were then analysed 1 month later for evidence of pathology. SHIP-deficiency of the haematolymphoid compartment is sufficient to alter enteric immune cell homeostatic responses in the small intestine resulting in a CD-like phenotype. we also observed that SHIP/ splenocytes transfer a mild to moderate eosinophilic crystalline pneumonia to WT hosts with progression to patchy pulmonary consolidation in some cases. CD-like ileitis observed in SHIP-deficient small intestines is not attributable to an autoimmune attack by SHIP-deficient T cells. analysis of CD11c+CD11b+ mature dendritic cells and CD4+CD25+ Treg cells did not show a significant difference in the numbers of these immune cells. among the 53 SHIP-deficient mice evaluated, only 3 of the 53 (6%) of SHIP-deficient mice lacked ileitis. 50 of the 53 (94%) of SHIP-deficient mice had some degree of ileitis, significantly more than the absence of ileitis in WT littermates. grade 1 Crohn's disease-like ileitis of SHIP-deficient mice was comprised of a moderate, mixed, predominantly polymorphonuclear leucocyte infiltration of the ileum lamina propria. this PMN infiltration of the ileum was typically present in the mucosa overlying and within lymph nodules. grade 4 Crohn's disease-like ileitis of SHIP-deficient mice was comprised of a marked, mixed, predominantly polymorphonuclear (PMN) inflammatory cell infiltration of the ileum extending through the mucosa, submucosa, and into the tunica muscularis. such inflammatory cell infiltrations varied in composition, were in some areas of affected ileum predominantly polymorphonuclear (D), while in other areas were predominantly mono most SHIP-deficient mice presented with grade 6 Crohn's disease-like ileitis. earliest manifestation of CD-like ileitis in SHIP-deficient mice, assigned grade 1, consisted of mild (25 PMN/hpf), predominantly PMN leucocyte infiltration of the lamina propria and frequently underlying lymph nodule. deficient mice had grade 3 inflammatory lesions within the ileum. six of 53 (11%) of SHIP-deficient mice had grade 4 inflammatory lesions. grade 4 inflammation varied from PMN in some segments to mononuclear in others. more SHIP-deficient mice were assigned inflammatory grade 6 than any other grade with 23 of 53 (43%) assigned ileitis grade 6. inflammation extending into the mesentery consisted of mixed inflammatory cells, granuloma, fibrosis, and rarely thrombosis and vasculitis. draining mesenteric lymph nodes were often enlarged and inflamed in 33 of 53 (62%) of SHIP-deficient mice. an individual SHIP/ mouse had inflammatory cellular thrombi in mesenteric veins and a granulomatous pulmonary consolidation comparable to the ileitis in this case. SHIP-deficient mice develop an eosinophilic crystalline pneumonia. it consists of large crystals in bronchiolar airways, foci of mixed inflammatory cell infiltrations (A, arrow), bronchiolar subepithelial fibrosis (B, arrows), hypertrophy and mucous metaplasia of bronchiolar epithelium (C), numerous alveolar macrophages and multinucleate cells (D, E only 1 (8%) of the 12 MxCreSHIPflox/flox mice lacked ileitis. 11 of 12 (92%) developed ileitis with a mean inflammatory grade of 3.51.9. SHIP-deficient parenchymal cells do not cause ileitis. /IP mice were not present in lungs of SHIP/ hosts reconstituted with WT C57BL/6 BM. SHIP-deficient haematolymphoid cells transfer ileitis to WT hosts. small intestine Our pathology findings and adoptive transfer studies described above suggest that a granulocyte\u2013monocyte lineage cell may underlie the ileitis that we observe in SHIP-deficient mice. to further evaluate this possibility, we conducted multi-parametric cytometry assays of major immune cell populations including neutrophils, dendritic cells, CD4/CD8 T cells and Treg cells present in small intestines. total CD16/32+Ly6G+ neutrophils and CD62L+ neutrophils in the small intestine of SHIP-deficient and WT mice as indicated. FACS detection of CD3+CD4+ (A) and CD3+CD8+ (B) T cells in the small intestine of SHIP-deficient and their wild-type (WT) littermates. transfer of SHIP-deficient haematolymphoid cells from the spleen is sufficient to trigger CD-like ileitis in an immunocompetent host. this suggests that a SHIP-deficient myeloid cell may promote the CD-like enteritis that occurs in SHIP-deficient mice. ileitis in SHIP-deficient mice may result from a deficit in mucosal T cell function. the present SHIP-deficient mouse is unique in that it recapitulates the CD phenotype apparently through perturbation of immune cells that can be transferred to a host. the CD-like pathological findings are routinely observed in the ileum of both SHIP/ strains31 41 and the SHIPIPIPIPIP strain47 that harbour different mutations of the SHIP1 gene. phenotype occurs in the SHIPIPIPIP strain where only the inositol phosphatase domain encoding exons of SHIP are excised. genetic analysis of mice and genome wide association studies have led to the identification of mutations that can predispose to CD with varying probability of incidence and timing of onset. a similar situation may also be revealed by close examination of SHIP expression and function in CD patients."}
