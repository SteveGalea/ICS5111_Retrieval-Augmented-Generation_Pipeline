{"summary": "interferons (IFNs) are the most important cytokines aimed to restrict viral replication and spread. the 2\u2032\u20135\u2032 oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)/RNase L pathway is one of the best-characterized IFN effector pathways. IFN-resistant genotypes of hepatitis C virus (HCV) accumulated fewer RNase L cleavage sites compared to IFN-sensitive HCV genotypes [16], [17]. EMCV was shown to upregulate the expression of RLI, a cellular protein that antagonizes 2\u20135A binding and RNase L activation. istent strains of Theiler's virus are responsible for a biphasic CNS infection. the virus migrates to the spinal cord white matter where it infects macrophages and oligodendrocytes. the virus persists lifelong in spite of a strong innate and adaptive immune response. apoptosis is not directly linked to the impaired replication of L*-mutant viruses in macrophages. apoptosis is not directly linked to the impaired replication of L*-mutant viruses in macrophage cell lines. we hypothesized that L* inhibits a cellular ribonuclease (RNase) activated following virus infection. we hypothesized that this RNase was RNase L, an effector of the IFN response. TMEV L* protein inhibits the OAS/RNase L pathway. results show that RNase L is the nuclease responsible for RNA degradation. theiler's virus L* protein inhibits the 2\u20135A/RNase L pathway in infected macrophages. peritoneal macrophages prepared from RNase L / (central panel) or RNase L+/+ 129/Sv mice were mock-infected or infected at a MOI of 20 with VV18 (L* WT), TM770 (L* 1\u201392) or FS58 (L* 1\u201312) the reduced fitness of L*-mutant viruses in macrophages mostly results from the inability of these viruses to counteract RNase L activity. basal expression of enzymes involved in the IFN-inducible 2\u20135A/RNase L pathway can vary according to the cell type. Mock-treated or IFN--treated L929 cells were infected with 2 PFU per cell of viruses KJ6 (L* WT) and FS57 (L* 1\u201392) total RNA was extracted 16 hours post-infection and viral replication was followed by quantitative RT-PCR. a small (3.5-fold) but significant reduction of viral RNA replication was observed for the mutant, compared to the wild-type virus. total cell RNA was then isolated and analyzed on RNA chips. ectopic expression prevents poly(I:C) and 2\u20135A-mediated rRNA degradation. inhibition of the OAS/RNase L pathway by TMEV L* is effective in non-macrophage cell lines. poly(I:C) was transfected in IFN-primed L929-L* and L929-NEO cells. poly(I:C)-triggered RNA degradation was observed in samples from L*-expressing cells. no RNA degradation was detected in L*-expressing cells. atypical mechanism of RNase L inhibition has been discovered in the case of poliovirus, the prototypical member of the Picornaviridae family. in this case, RNase L inhibition involved a cleavage-resistant RNA structure formed by the 3C-coding region of the poliovirus genome. TMEV tested whether inhibition of the OAS/RNase L pathway was due to the expression of L*-coding RNA. TMEV L* protein interacts with the murine RNase L during infection. we cloned the murine RNase L from cDNA and verified that the cloned RNase L was catalytically active and 2\u20135A-dependent. we also constructed a TMEV recombinant virus, called FS96, expressing a N-terminally HA-tagged L* protein (HA-L*) TMEV L* and muRNase L proteins interact in infected murine cells. a signal corresponding to the HA-L* protein was detected by immunoblot. a signal corresponding to the HA-L* protein was detected by immunoblot. TMEV L* protein acts in a species-specific manner and interacts with the ankyrin domain of muRNase L. indicated cell lines were transduced with empty (Neo) or with L*-expressing lentiviruses. RNA degradation was assessed by RNA chips. 293/T cells were cotransfected with the chimeric constructs. total cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG (RNase L) and anti-HA (L*) antibodies (D) total cell lysates corresponding to 5% of the input used for immunoprecipitations were analyzed as controls (E). coimmunoprecipitation between HA-L* and the FLAG-tagged chimeric RNase L was conducted in transfected 293/T cells. in the first case, the lack of inhibition of huRNase L by L* would result from the inability of L* to bind the human adapter. TMEV L* protein directly interacts with the murine RNase L. cells expressing either empty vector (Puro) or L* were transfected with pcDNA3 or pcDNA3 derivatives expressing indicated RNase L constructs. wild-type (lanes 3\u20134), flagged (lanes 5\u20136) and catalytically inactive (R666A)(lanes 7\u20138) murine RNase L, or wild-type (lanes 9\u201310) and catalytically inactive (R667A)(lanes 11\u2013 tUNEL staining of infected cells failed to show any reproducible influence of L* on apoptosis in macrophages. apoptosis was not directly linked to impaired replication of L*-mutant viruses in macrophage cell lines. we hypothesize that this RNase was RNase L, an effector of the IFN response. we hypothesize that L* fails to block apoptosis but prevents RNA degradation in infected macrophages. TMEV L* protein inhibits the OAS/RNase L pathway. we compared rRNA degradation in peritoneal macrophages prepared from RNase L/ and RNase L+/+ mice and infected with 20 plaque-forming units (PFU) per cell. theiler's virus L* protein inhibits the 2\u20135A/RNase L pathway in infected peritoneal macrophages. peritoneal macrophages prepared from RNase L / (central panel) or RNase L+/+ 129/Sv mice were mock-infected or infected at a MOI of 20 with VV18 (L* WT), TM770 (L* 1\u201392) or FS58 (L* 1\u2013 indirect immunofluorescent labeling of the VP1 capsid protein confirmed the higher replication level of the wild-type virus in RNase L+/+ cells. the reduced fitness of L*-mutant viruses in macrophages mostly results from the inability of these viruses to counteract RNase L activity. Mock-treated or IFN-treated L929 cells were infected with 2 PFU per cell of viruses KJ6 (L* WT) and FS57 (L* 1\u201392) total RNA was extracted 16 hours post-infection and viral replication was followed by quantitative RT-PCR. a small (3.5-fold) but significant reduction of viral RNA replication was observed for the mutant, compared to the wild-type virus. total cell RNA was then isolated and analyzed on RNA chips. the inhibition of the OAS/RNase L pathway by TMEV L* is effective in non-macrophage cell lines. this results indicate that the inhibition of the OAS/RNase L pathway by TMEV L* is effective in non-macrophage cell lines. poly(I:C) was transfected in IFN-primed L929-L* and L929-NEO cells. poly(I:C)-triggered RNA degradation was observed in samples from L*-expressing cells. no RNA degradation was detected in L*-expressing cells. mechanism of RNase L inhibition has been discovered in the case of poliovirus. it involved a cleavage-resistant RNA structure formed by the 3C-coding region of the poliovirus genome. TMEV tested whether inhibition of the OAS/RNase L pathway was due to the expression of L*-coding RNA. TMEV L* protein interacts with the murine RNase L during infection. we cloned the murine RNase L from cDNA (Genbank accession JX443419) and verified that the cloned RNase L was catalytically active and 2\u20135A-dependent. we also constructed a TMEV recombinant virus, called FS96, expressing a N-terminally HA-tagged L* protein (HA-L* TMEV L* and muRNase L proteins interact in infected murine cells. cell lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with indicated antibodies. 5% of the input used for immunoprecipitations were analyzed. TMEV L* protein acts in a species-specific manner and interacts with the ankyrin domain of muRNase L. indicated cell lines were transduced with empty (Neo) or with L*-expressing lentiviruses. RNA degradation was assessed by RNA chips. 293/T cells were cotransfected with expression plasmids coding for HA-L* and for either murine or human FLAG-RNase L. total cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG (RNase L) and anti-HA (L*) antibodies. a lack of inhibition of huRNase L by L* would result from the inability of L* to bind the human adapter. TMEV L* protein directly interacts with the murine RNase L. the second encodes converse chimera (Nmu-Chu) stably expressing either empty vector (Puro) or L* were transfected with pcDNA3 or pcDNA3 derivatives expressing indicated RNase L constructs. wild-type (lanes 3\u20134), flagged (lanes 5\u20136) and catalytically inactive (R666A)(lanes 7\u20138) murine RNase L, or wild-type (lanes 9\u201310) and catalytically inactive (R667A)(lanes this experiment confirms the lack of adaptor protein required for RNaseL inhibition by L* as well as the species-specificity of L* activity. this protein is important for the establishment of persistent CNS infections by TMEV [32], [34]. RNase L activity is a major cause of L*-mutant virus replication inhibition in macrophages. ectopic expression of L* allows to rescue the replication of mutant viruses, through RNase L antagonism. several viral proteins were shown to interfere with the OAS/RNase L pathway. proteins like influenza A NS1 are believed to act by sequestering dsRNA. hiding dsRNA is also expected to prevent other events triggered by dsRNA, such as the activation of PKR or of the helicases. mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) was recently shown to interfere with RNase L activation in macrophages by triggering the cleavage of 2\u20135A with a virally-encoded 2\u2032,5\u2032-phosphodiesterase [15]. it is therefore tempting to speculate that the antiviral activity of RNase L is particularly prominent in macrophages which fits with the observation that these cells contain higher basal levels of OAS enzymes. peritoneal macrophages from 129/Sv, RNase L/ and C57BL/6 mice were harvested 4 days after inoculation of 1.5 ml of sterile 10% Thioglycolate Medium, Brewer Modified. cells were washed by centrifugation at 300 g for 5 min and resuspended in RPMI containing 10% FCS, 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.5 and 2 mM L-glutamine DA1 mutants carrying stop codon mutations in L* were described previously. mutations L* 1\u201312 (virus OV84) and L* 1\u201392 (virus OV42) prevented expression of full-length L* protein. both mutations affected the ability of the virus to establish persistent infections of the mouse CNS. Viruses were resuspended in 300 l of Tris-HCl, 10 mM pH 7.5. they were dialyzed against the same buffer using Slide-A-Lyser Dialysis Cassette 10,000 MWCO. for macrophage infection, viruses were typically used at a MOI of 20 PFU per cell. duced cells were selected with G418 (1 mg/ml) or puromycin (2 g/ml). transgene expression was verified by indirect immunufluorescence or immunoblot analysis. RNA isolation, RNA chips and real-time PCR RNA was isolated by the method of Chomczinsky and Sacchi. RNA degradation was assessed by running RNA samples either on conventional 1% agarose gels in Tris-sodium acetate-EDTA buffer or on RNA nano 6000 microfluidics chips run on a 2100 Bioanalyzer.

NS is indicative of p-values higher than 0.05; * is indicative of p-values of 0.05. a recombinant TMEV cDNA was constructed, carrying the extra sequence coding for the HA epitope at the N-terminus of L*: 5\u2032 GGT ACC CGT ACG ACG TTC CGG ACT ACG TTC CGG ACT ACG CGC TTG TAA GCA CGG 3\u2032. the corresponding virus, FS96, produced by reverse genetics gave titers and plaque sizes similar to those of the parental DA1 virus in L929 cells infected with these viruses, cytopathic effect becomes visible from 6 hours post-infection. viral replication was found to peak between 12 and 20 h post-infection. TMEV plasmids carry point mutations in capsid that increase the efficiency of cell infection. pQCXIN and pQCXIP (Clontech) plasmids carry point mutations in capsid that increase the efficiency of macrophage infection. pFS27 L* Puro Retroviral (pQCXIP) pTM898 - Neo Lentiviral (pTM898) pTM900 - Hygro Lentiviral (HIV) pFS174 FLAG-muRNase L Hygro Lentiviral (pTM900) pcDNA3 - Neo Plasmid pTM667-8 L* Neo Plasmid (pcDNA3) pFS111 HA-L* Neo Plasmid RNA degradation was assessed by running RNA samples either on conventional 1% agarose gels in Tris-sodium acetate-EDTA buffer or on RNA nano 6000 microfluidics chips run on a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) cells were then incubated for 1 hour with primary antibodies diluted in the same buffer at a dilution of 1800 (anti-L*, rabbit polyclonal) or 110 (anti VP1-F12B3, mouse monoclonal) after extensive washes with Tween 20 0.1% in PBS, species-matched AlexaFluor-conjugated secondary antibodies were added. cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and harvested in lysis buffer (Tris-HCl 50 mM pH 8, NaCl 100 mM, NP40 0.5%, EDTA 2 mM, PMSF 1 mM, protease (Sigma) and phosphatase (Calbiochem) inhibitors. supernatants were pre-cleared using 50 l bed-volume of Protein A/ plasmid L*-pET15b was expressed in shuffle T7 express E. coli. cells were harvested and washed with ice cold 20 mM HEPES pH 8.2 containing 150 mM NaCl and lysed by sonication. the recombinant murine (180 nM) or human RNase L (100 nM) were pre-incubated with purified L* (10 g/ml) for 10 min on ice. the reactions contained 100 nM FRET probe, 25 mM Tris\u2013HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 100 M ATP, and 7.2 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. measuring 2\u20135A levels in cells The L929 cells stably expressing L* (L929-L*) or transduced with the empty vector (L929-NEO) were transfected with poly(I :C) for different times. cell suspension was heated to 95\u00b0C for 7 min.
