{"summary": "emphysema and osteoporosis are epidemiologically associated diseases of cigarette smokers. the causal mechanism(s) linking these illnesses is unknown. emphysema among tobacco smokers often occurs in association with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a complex syndrome typified by airway narrowing and inflammation. smoking-associated lung diseases are also linked to many systemic abnormalities, including vasculopathies [5], lung cancer [6], renal dysfunction [7], and osteoporosis. the pathophysiological processes that cause or promote emphysema and its co-morbidities remain enigmatic. systemic immunological responses, including the actions of activated monocyte-lineage phagocytes, have been implicated in these disorders. however, most reports of autoimmunity in smokers to date are correlative rather than mechanistic. subjects recruited under auspices of the Specialized Center for Clinically Oriented Research (SCCOR) registry at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center were excluded. subjects with unstable cardiovascular disease, malignancies, chronic oral steroid use, or BMI >35 were excluded. clotted (non-heparinized) blood was isolated by density-gradient centrifugation. bone mineral density (BMD) was measured at the hip and lumbar spine using a bone densitometer. autoantigens associated with smoking-related emphysema could be identified by using patient-derived IgG antibodies to immunoprecipitate these autoantigens from cell lysates. we hypothesize that autoantigens associated with smoking-related emphysema could be identified by using patient-derived IgG antibodies. glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78), a member of the heat shock protein 70 family, was identified in two sequential discovery assays. unpublished findings indicated the presence of an autoantibody with specificity for a then cryptic 75 kDa cell antigen tended to be associated with disease manifestations among smokers. the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and blocked with 5% dry milk in TTBS. each of these was individually incubated overnight at 4o with a particular subject plasma specimen (@ 120 dilution) the strips were washed in TTBS, and then incubated for one hour. bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was obtained from lung explants by wedging sterile plastic tubing in segmental bronchi. the supernatant was centrifuged (400 g), concentrated using 3 kDa centrifugation-size filters (Millipore, Billerica, MA), and quantified by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay. the immunoblotting method was validated using commercial rGRP78 and lysates of normal human CD14+-derived macrophages. the IgG was applied to rGRP cross-linked to an AminoLink Plus Gel Spin column (Thermo Scientific), following manufacturer protocols. cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-human IgG antibody. cells were incubated with 2 mcg/ml of either anti-GRP78 or normal human IgG for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C. media was removed from concurrent, autologous macrophage cultures. human leukocyte antigen (HLA) Class II DRB1*15 Allele prevalence was determined by leukocyte DNA PCR-SSP [21]. idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients with clinically-relevant autoimmunity are over-represented in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. kine in cultures with added test antigen(s) minus cytokine production. chi-square compared results of two or more assays in the same specimen. chi-square compared results of two or more assays in the same specimen. 0%, 10%, 10\u201325%, 26\u201350%, 51\u201375%, and >75% visual emphysema are associated with clinically important outcomes in smokers [6]\u2013[8]. the validity and comparability of these assessments with other radiographic measures of emphysema has also been established. Flow cytometry confirmed >98% of the cells harvested day seven expressed intracellular CD68+ and were CD3 and CD19. non-adherent cells were collected and cultured for 28 days in the same media supplemented with 25 ng/ml M-CSF. emphysema IgG-bound autoantigens were eluted by acidification, pH neutralized, concentrated by centrifugal size-filtration. gels were imaged by Typhoon TRIO (GE Healthcare) and analyzed by Image QuantTL software (GE Healthcare) recombinant rGRP78 was purchased from prospec (Rehovot, Israel) aliquots were frozen at 80\u00b0C until use. the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and blocked with 5% dry milk in TTBS (50 mM Tris HCl [pH 7.4], 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) Lung Specimens Tissue (0.5\u20131 cm3) was dissected from emphysematous lungs explanted during therapeutic transplantations and cadaveric normal lungs that were not used as donor organs. the few equivocal specimens were repeated until all blinded judges were in agreement. immunoblotting method was validated using commercial rGRP78 and lysates of normal human CD14+-derived macrophages. anti-GRP78 was eluted by acidification, pH neutralized, concentrated using 5 kDa centrifugation filters and validated for IgG characteristics and specific avidity. indirect immunofluorescence assays (IFA) Plate-bound normal alveolar macrophages from BALF (n = 3) and bone marrow osteoclasts (n = 2) were pre-incubated with 0.1 bovine serum albumin and azide-free Fc receptor blocker. cells were incubated for 30 minutes with 0.5 mcg/ml of patient-derived anti-GRP78 IgG or the same concentration of pooled normal human Ig mice were analyzed for mediator productions using protein-suspended bead array platform multiplex kits (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), following manufacturer's protocols [21]. idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients with clinically-relevant autoimmunity are over-represented. ration was determined by incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), added two days prior to cell harvest, with measurements in gated CD4 T-cells established by flow cytometry. Specific indices (SI) of proliferation were calculated as %CD4 T-cells that produced this cytokine in cultures with added test antigen(s) minus incorporation in concurrent unstimulated (control) cultures. 42 (42) of 175 emphysematous subjects had normal spirometry. another distinct cohort of healthy controls who had never smoked (n = 27) were 595 years old and 63% were male. ema = subjects with emphysema on CT scan; p values are for nonparametric comparisons of smokers who do not have anti-GRP78 IgG autoantibodies (GRP78+); NS = not significant. females were over-represented among the smokers who had anti-GRP78 autoantibodies. anti-GRP78 autoantibodies are significantly associated with emphysema prevalence (%) in the smoking subjects. emphysema scores per CT were also significantly greater among those subjects with anti-GRP78 autoantibodies. lowest, second lowest, middle, second highest, and highest lines represent 10th, 25th, median, 75th, and 90th percentiles respectively. serum levels of bone turnover metabolite type 1 (N-terminal) procollagen were greatest among smokers with anti-GRP78 autoantibodies. a post hoc analysis was performed to compare autoantibody prevalence in those subjects who have concurrent emphysema and osteopenia. emphysematous lungs showed increased immunostaining in macrophages and alveolar epithelial cells (blue arrows) bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from emphysematous lungs was greater in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from individual emphysematous lung explants. augmented productions of IL-8 (B.), CCL-2 (C.) and MMP9 (C.) rGRP78 does not induce proliferation or IFN-gamma production in CD4 T-cells from normal nonsmoking subjects. GRP78-induced CD4 T-cell proliferation was greatest among cultures from smokers with emphysema (n = 34) specific indices were calculated as %CD4 T-cells producing IFN-gamma production in GRP78-supplemented cultures minus that of concurrent controls. age (years old)* 670.4 670.5 670.7 NS % male 58 63 47 0.01 Still smoking (%) 42 41 43 NS Pack-years* 632 652 593 NS ICS (%) 22 20 28 NS Past oral steroids (%) 7 7 NS FEV1% predicted* 771 782 743 NS FEV1/FVC* 0.630.01 0.640.1 0.600.2 NS DLCO% predicted* 682 712 642 0.02 the prevalence of autoantibodies to GRP78 was greater in smokers (32.2%) than in the healthy, never-smoked controls (7.4%) females were over-represented among the smokers who had anti-GRP78 autoantibodies. females were over-represented among the smokers who had anti-GRP78 autoantibodies. the presence of anti-GRP78 autoantibodies was significantly associated with the prevalence (Figure 1B) and severity of emphysema. the presence of anti-GRP78 autoantibodies was also highly associated with decreased bone mineral density and osteoporosis. anti-GRP78 autoantibody prevalence was significantly greater in smokers with both emphysema and osteopenia. intrapulmonary GRP78 expression GRP78 protein was and increased in emphysema specimens and predominantly localized in alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages. emphysematous lungs showed increased immunostaining in macrophages and alveolar epithelial cells. bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from emphysematous lungs was greater in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from individual emphysematous lung explants. lanes 9\u201314 are BALF from normal lung explants. NFkB among paired, concurrent autologous CD14+ derived macrophages was increased in all 10 normal specimens after incubation with patient-derived autoantibodies to GRP78 (-GRP78) relative to control cells treated with normal human IgG. rGRP78 does not induce proliferation or IFN-gamma production in CD4 T-cells from emphysematous smokers. specific indices (SI) of proliferation were calculated as %CD4 T-cells producing IFN-gamma production in GRP78-supplemented cultures minus incorporation in concurrent media controls. IFN-gamma production was also greatest in the CD4 T-cells from the emphysematous smokers. obverse of analogous studies in IPF patients in whom DRB1*15 is over-represented among those with autoantibodies against heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), a stress response protein with considerable sequence homology to GRP78 [21] disparate findings are thus indicative of biologically-distinct, antigen- and disease-specific autoimmune responses. incubations with anti-GRP78 also increased macrophage production of MMP9, a type IV collagenase produced by macrophages and osteoclasts that promote enzymatic breakdown of extracellular matrix. emphysema and osteoporosis are most prominent among middle-aged or elderly smokers. increased production of IFN-gamma is believed to be an important factor in the pathogenesis of smoking-associated lung disease. increased production of IFN-gamma in particular is believed to be an important factor in the pathogenesis of smoking-associated lung disease. anti-GRP78 autoreactivity is prevalent among subjects with rheumatoid arthritis. autoantibodies from these patients also enhance macrophage pro-inflammatory functions. findings lend support to an evolving paradigm of autoimmune pathogenesis in smoking-associated lung diseases. immunoblots were used to detect circulating anti-GRP78 autoantibodies in plasma specimens. rGRP detected with mouse anti-human GRP78 monoclonal antibody. 78 confirmed by rGRP78 immunoblot. patient-derived anti-GRP78 IgG was used here at a concentration of 1 g/ml."}
