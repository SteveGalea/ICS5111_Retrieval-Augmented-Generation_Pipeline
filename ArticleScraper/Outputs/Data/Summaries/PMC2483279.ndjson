{"summary": "RNAi was induced by in vivo transfection of plasmid vectors encoding for short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting EGFP. RNAi was induced by in vivo transfection of plasmid vectors encoding for short hairpin RNAs. siRNAs are dsRNAs of 21\u201323 base pairs (bp) generated by chemical synthesis [6], enzymatic cleavage [7] or expression systems [8], while shRNAs are dsRNA molecules that mimic endogenous pre-miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) shRNAs consist of two palindromic sequences of 19\u201329 nucleotides (nt) with a short loop of single-stranded RNA (4\u2013 in vitro experiments were performed to verify the efficiency of RNAi in sertoli cells, the main transfected target cell seen in in vivo transfections. in vitro experiments were performed to verify the efficiency of RNAi in sertoli cells. in vivo electroporation Male mice of 30\u201345 days post-natal (dpn) were anaesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of Rompun (Bayer, Kiel Germany)/Ketolar (Pfizer, Dublin Ireland) solution (315 l/Kg; 84 mg/Kg respectively) each testis was held between tweezer-type electrodes briefly soaked in PBS. two sets of four electric pulses of square wave were applied. each pulse provided 50 V for 50 ms; the interval between the pulses was 950 ms. four days later the mice were sacrificed and the testes removed. testes from 17 days post-natal (dpn) were decapsulated in DMEM:Ham's F12 medium (1:1, Gibco BRL, Eggenstein, Germany) containing 2% foetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.2 mg/ml collagenase-dispase (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and 0.1 mg/ml DNAse I (Roche) for 30 min at 32\u00b0C. germ cells that had residually attached to the Sertoli cells were removed by hypotonic treatment with 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 at 20\u00b0C for 3 min. RT-PCR analysis was performed for the expression of Hsd17 (17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase) as a Leydig cell marker and S16 (ribosomal protein) were assessed as negative and positive controls respectively. ected cells were detected by the presence of HcRed1 excited at 630 nm and emission recorded at 660 nm. each value represents the mean of three individual experiments. pGtoR contains the RNA polimerase III promoter H1. in vivo electroporation Male mice of 30\u201345 days post-natal (dpn) were anaesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of Rompun (Bayer, Kiel Germany)/Ketolar (Pfizer, Dublin Ireland) solution (315 l/Kg; 84 mg/Kg respectively) after opening the abdominal cavity, the testes were exposed under a binocular microscope. testes were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, passed through a series of 10, 20 and 30% sucrose. the samples were then placed in Tissue-Tek OCT (Sakura Finetek, The Netherlands) and frozen on dry ice. the cells were incubated in DMEM:F12 containing 2% FBS, 0.4 mg/ml hyaluronidase I-S and 0.1 mg/ml DNAse I for 30 min at 32\u00b0C. the settled cells were cultured at 32\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere for three days in DMEM:F12. the cells were harvested three, five and seven days post-transfection. each experiment was performed three times. the average number of cells analysed per flow cytometry run was 3 104 cells. cytological detection of green or red fluorescent proteins indicated that Sertoli cells were the cell type most commonly transfected. but the efficiency of transfection of Sertoli cells was always less than 10% although no differences were found between the plasmids used. red1-shRNA-EGFP (pGtoR) [50] allows detection of transfected cells expressing shRNA-EGFP, based on the co-expression of the red fluorescence protein HcRed1. the reduction in green fluorescence from monocellular dispersions of seminiferous tubule cells from in vivo transfected testis was measured by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) the histogram shows the mean (Mean SE) intensity of green fluorescence of the cells (EGFP) transfected in vivo with pRed or pGtoR. sertoli cells from C57B/6J mice were independently transfected with pEGFP-N1, pGtoR or pRed vectors. fluorescence intensity in transfected Sertoli cells was determined by flow cytometry. reduction of EGFP fluorescence was more significant at seven days (41.77%) and five days (36.55%) than at three days post-transfection (28.63%) in the mature mouse, sertoli cells occupy approximately 15\u201320% of the volume of the seminiferous epithelium. a large proportion of the Sertoli cell surface is in contact with elongated spermatids and the tubular lumen [63] the sertoli cells should be the most readily transfected cell type. elongated spermatids are the germ cells most likely to be transfected. elongated spermatids are in an advanced state of chromatin condensation. this reduces their volume by approximately 25%. this confers characteristics upon them that disables the entrance of transfecting molecules to the cytoplasm. cytological detection of green or red fluorescent proteins indicated that Sertoli cells were the cell type most commonly transfected. but the efficiency of transfection of Sertoli cells was always less than 10% although no differences were found between the plasmids used. altering the experimental conditions, i.e. increasing voltage and/or the number of electrical pulses, was found to damage the seminiferous epithelium as assessed by histopathological analysis. RNA-EGFP is based on the co-expression of the red fluorescence protein HcRed1. the reduction in green fluorescence from monocellular dispersions of seminiferous tubule cells from in vivo transfected testis was measured by fluorescence activated cell sorting. red fluorescent cells were selected four days after transfection. transfection and gene silencing were assessed in cultured primary Sertoli cells. sertoli cells from C57B/6J mice were independently transfected with pEGFP-N1 and 25% with pRed or pRed. the reduction of EGFP fluorescence was more significant at seven days (41.77%) and five days (36.55%) than at three days post-transfection. the efficiency of vector transfection in vivo after electroporation was relatively low with all the vectors used. in the mature mouse, Sertoli cells occupy approximately 15\u201320% of the volume of the seminiferous epithelium. a large proportion of the Sertoli cell surface is in contact with elongated spermatids and the tubular lumen. in vivo gene transfer to seminiferous epithelium cells has been conducted in the past using different strategies. elongated spermatids are the germ cells most likely to be transfected. elongated spermatids are in an advanced state of chromatin condensation. this reduces their volume by approximately 25%. this confers characteristics upon them that disables the entrance of transfecting molecules to the cytoplasm. contributions EGG participated in designing the study and performed the experimental transfection of shRNAs.
