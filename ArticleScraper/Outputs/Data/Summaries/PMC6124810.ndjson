{"summary": "structural viral proteins have an inherent property for self-assembly. these structures mimic the morphology of the native virus. they do not replicate within the host cell, but can be used as carriers for nucleic acids, proteins or drugs. HCoV-NL63 virion is composed of membrane (M), envelope (E) and protruding spike (S) proteins. the HCoV-NL63 virion is composed of membrane (M), envelope (E) and protruding spike (S) proteins, all three shaping the membrane to form the envelope protecting ribonucleocapsid. in this manuscript we present the design and production of HCoV-NL63-based VLPs. several modifications of proteins forming HCoV-NL63 VLP were introduced. HCoV-NL63 VLPs may serve as highly specific delivery vectors to cells expressing the ACE2 protein. human airway epithelium cultures were prepared and maintained as previously described. primary human tracheobronchial epithelial cells were obtained from airway specimens resected from patients undergoing surgery under Silesian center for heart diseases. recombinant bacmids and baculoviruses were generated using BAC-TO-BAC system. the isolated bacmid DNA was purified and transfected into Sf9 cells. after 6 days recombinant baculoviruses were harvested, then amplified and finally titrated using plaque assay method. samples were resolved by 8% Laemmli SDS-PAGE, for M protein by 12% Laemmli SDS-PAGE, for E protein by 16% Schagger/von Jagov SDS-PAGE. gels were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue or subjected to electrotransfer in 25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 20% methanol buffer onto an activated PVDF membrane. cell culture supernatant was collected 72 hours p.i. from HF culture infected with (M+E rBV) an aliquot of culture supernatant was diluted with water and mixed with denaturation buffer containing 10% SDS and 5% -mercaptoethanol. samples were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 15 minutes in the presence or absence of SDS. cells were infected with rBVs at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 and 48 hours p.i. expression of M, M-HA, E, E-HA and S proteins was detected with rabbit polyclonal anti-membrane serum (1:1,000; 2 hours incubation), mouse anti-HA antibody (1:500, Antibodies Online, USA), and rabbit polyclonal anti-S serum (1:100. LLC-Mk2 cells were pre-incubated for 2 hours with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. ACE2 was detected with rabbit antibody (1:100, Abcam, UK) and secondary anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with Alexa 488 at 1:400 dilution (Santa Cruz, USA) all images were processed using ImageJ 1.47v (Leica Microsystems CMS GmbH, Germany) and ZEN 2012 SP1 software (Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH, Germany), respectively. HF cells were co-infected with (M + E) rBV and S rBVs at MOI = 4 and cultured for 48 hours. untagged VLPs were harvested by centrifugation (5,000 g, 30 min) of cell culture medium (secreted fraction) or by re-suspension of cells expressing tagged VLPs were disrupted by 3 rounds of mechanical homogenization. before purification, the column was equilibrated with the binding buffer. the collected peak fractions were pooled and counter dialysed against 25 mM Tris pH 8, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA buffer. the dialysate was loaded onto 1 ml CIM-QA monolith column pre-equilibrated with dialysis buffer and connected to AKTA FPLC system. cell lines and viruses Sf9 (Spodiptera frugiperda, ATCC: CRL-1711) and HF (High Five, Trichoplusia ni, ATCC: CRL-7701) cells were cultured in a medium supplemented with 2% FBS (fetal bovine serum), 100 g/ml streptomycin, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 10 g/ml gentamycin, and 0.25 g/m the culture was maintained at 37\u00b0C under 5% CO2. primary human tracheobronchial epithelial cells were obtained from airway specimens resected from patients undergoing surgery under Silesian center for heart disease. recombinant bacmids and baculoviruses were generated using BAC-TO-BAC system. bacmids and baculoviruses were generated using recombinant pFastBacDual vectors. the isolated bacmid DNA was purified and transfected into Sf9 cells. gels were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue or subjected to electrotransfer in 25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 20% methanol buffer onto activated PVDF membrane. membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline supplemented with 0.05% of Tween 20. cell culture supernatant was collected 72 hours p.i. from HF culture infected with (M+E rBV) an aliquot of culture supernatant was diluted with water and mixed with denaturation buffer containing 10% SDS and 5% -mercaptoethanol. samples were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 15 minutes in the presence or absence of SDS. HF cells were grown in 6-well culture plates on glass coverslips coated with 0.01% poly-L-ornithine in water. cells were infected with rBVs at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 and 48 hours p.i. expression of M, M-HA, E, E-HA and S proteins was detected with rabbit polyclonal anti-membrane serum (1:1,000; 2 hours incubation) LLC-Mk2 cells or HAE cultures were incubated for 3 hours at 32\u00b0C under 5% CO2 and further washed thrice with PBS. cells were fixed, permeabilized and stained as described above. images were acquired using Leica Application Suite Advanced Fluorescence LAS AF v. 2.2.1 (Leica Microsystems CMS GmbH, Germany) or ZEN 2012 SP1 software (Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH, Germany) all images were processed using ImageJ 1.47v (National Institute of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA) with only linear adjustments of brightness and contrast. ultrastructural observations were performed by transmission electron microscope Hitachi H500 at an accelerating voltage of 75 kV. for imaging of purified VLPs the suspension was fixed in Karnovski solution and inoculated onto a single-hole copper grids. after drying the material was stained with uranyl acetate and citrate lead. proteins were eluted with linear NaCl gradient (50 mM to 2 M NaCl in binding buffer) the collected peak fractions were pooled and counter dialysed against 25 mM Tris pH 8, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA buffer. cells were seeded in 96-well culture plate 48 hours earlier. cells were incubated for 3 hours under 5% CO2 and washed 4 times with PBS. cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. expression of HCoV-NL63 proteins was sufficient to be detected by coomassie staining of the SDS-PAGE gel. respective bands were visible in cell lysates collected 48, 72 and 96 hours p.i. the M and the S proteins were more elusive, and their expression could only be confirmed by Western blot. HF cells were co-infected with different monocistronic rBVs. this result suggests that HA tag on the E protein impairs its interaction with other proteins and thus precludes VLP formation. however, considering results of co-localization studies, tagged or untagged M protein and untagged variants of E and S were selected for further analysis. co-infection of monocistronic M with E did not lead to detectable VLP secretion. for this reason, bicistronic (M + E) and (M-HA + E) rBVs were used in subsequent experiments. Western blot found that secreted M and E proteins were assembled into enveloped particles. the resistance to trypsin proteolysis was evaluated. cytoplasm of cells undergoing apoptosis due to baculovirus infection. HF cells co-infected with (M + E) rBV and S rBV (a), infected with control rBV (b) and uninfected HF cells (c) respective fractions were collected (indicated with frames) and analyzed with Western blot with anti-M and anti-S antibodies (b). VLP internalization into target cells We investigated the capacity of HCoV-NL63 VLPs to transduce target cells. for this, LLC-Mk2 cells were incubated with the VLPs. LLC-Mk2 cells and HAE cultures (b) were incubated with (M + E) + S VLPs, (M-HA + E) + S VLPs, HCoV-NL63 and mock. cells were then immunostained and analyzed by confocal microscopy (Z-stacks) ACE2 relative quantity per cell after PMA treatment or mock-treatment was determined. HCoV-NL63 VLPs mediated delivery to target cells. a signal was clearly detected only in preparations were VLPs present. antibody (a), anti-HA antibody alone (b) HA-tagged VLPs alone (c) or control (mock-incubated) cells (d) abI denotes primary antibody (anti-HA tag) and abII denotes secondary antibody, conjugated with the fluorophore. ELISA detection of anti-HA antibody transported to LLC-Mk2 cells. recombinant baculoviruses coding for M, E and S proteins of HCoV-NL63 were created. all sequences were codon-optimized for the expression in insect cells. expression of the E protein was sufficient to be detected by coomassie staining of the SDS-PAGE gel. rBVs were grown on coverslips, fixed and stained with fluorophore conjugated antibodies. expression and co-localization of HCoV-NL63 proteins in insect cells. HF cells were co-infected with monocistronic rBVs. HCoV-NL63 VLPs are properly expressed and co-localize in insect cells only when all three proteins are untagged, or when M protein is HA-tagged. media harvested from HF cells infected with bicistronic (M + E) and (M-HA + E) or monocistronic M and M-HA rBVs were analyzed by Western blot with anti-M antibody. this experiment revealed that M protein can be only detected in culture medium when HF cells infected with (M + E) rBV were lysed, mixed with denaturing buffer containing 10% SDS and 5% -mercaptoethanol. aliquots of supernatants containing (M + E) HCoV-NL63 VLPs were incubated with (+) or without (-) trypsin and SDS and analyzed by Western blot. HF cells co-infected with (M + E) rBV and S rBV were examined under electron microscopy. the diameter of putative VLPs ranged from 40 nm to 200 nm. the diameter of putative VLPs ranged from 40 nm to 200 nm. Western blot analysis showed the presence of M and S proteins in the same fractions. homogeneity of the obtained material was assessed by Dynamic Light Scattering. the mean diameter of obtained VLPs is 180 nm. LLC-Mk2 cells were pre-treated with PMA, known to deplete ACE2 from the cell surface. VLPs adhesion, but not penetration into target cells pre-treated with PMA was observed, proving that the obtained VLPs specifically penetrate cells expressing the entry receptor. ACE2 molecule was additionally stained in PMA-treated LLC-Mk2 cells. ACE2 receptor is detected with anti-ACE2 antibody and visualized in yellow. each image is a single confocal plane (xy) with its orthogonal view (xz) anti-HA antibody was visualized with confocal microscopy. a signal was clearly detected only in preparations were VLPs present. HCoV-NL63 VLPs mediated delivery to target cells. the measured absorbance was proportional to the concentration of VLP-antibody complexes. the detected signal was similar for doses of 10 g and 20 g of antibody pre-incubated with VLPs. this result is a proof of concept for the development of the HCoV-NL63 VLP as a protein delivery platform. HA peptide tagged M protein was still assembly competent and the (M-HA + E) + S VLPs were functional but were not released from producer cells. only TEGV M protein was shown to adopt two topologies: Nexo-Cendo and Nexo-Cexo orientation. heparin column was successful and allowed partial purification of HCoV-NL63 VLPs. the quality of preparation was high, but unfortunately BVs co-purified with VLPs. this observation is in agreement with known BVs affinity for heparin columns. but this problem was solved by further fractionation using monolith ion exchange column. HCoV-NL63 VLP cell entry is mediated by ACE2 [67]. the presence of the ACE2 receptor on cell surface is a pre-requisite for internalization. HCoV-NL63 VLPs may serve as a carrier for antibodies.
