{"summary": "in the united states, mortality arising from respiratory disease is 50% higher in winter than in summer [1]. weather variability could influence influenza mortality variations. recent research examining climatic influences on influenza transmission has galvanized interest in this topic. cold and/or dry weather enhances human pneumonia and influenza (P&I) mortality through a retrospective study of daily mortality in new york city and environs from 1975\u20132002. it is commonly assumed that winter indoor crowding enhances influenza transmission, though direct evidence is lacking [8]. if correct, these relationships suggest that indoor winter heating without humidification could enhance influenza transmission [8]. our study examines daily mortality, and statistical robustness is enhanced when the daily sample size is sufficiently large. weather obviously has a high spatial variability, so it is important that the observed weather be representative of the environmental conditions likely experienced by the decedents. this research is exempt from IRB review under the auspices of Title 45 Part 46 exemption category 4. the number of deaths attributable to influenza is difficult to estimate directly because of a lack of virologically-confirmed infections. many influenza-associated deaths occur from secondary complications when influenza viruses are no longer detectable by laboratory means. we removed this artifact by converting each day's P&I mortality to a z-score. the time series of age-standardized mortality prior to and after deseasoning and z-score adjustment is shown in Figure 1a and Figure 1b. this z1 criterion was chosen because the frequency distribution of smoothed mortality is positively skewed. after smoothing, there is an obvious tendency for high mortality events to cluster into prolonged periods when the z1 threshold is exceeded. we thus identified 12 mortality episodes over the 28-year period of record. daily mortality data were deseasoned to remove the large influence of season on respiratory infection and converted to z-scores to adjust for discontinuities related to ICD coding. days or periods with z-scores>1 were identified as mortality \u201cevents\u201d or \u201cepisodes,\u201d respectively. temperature and dew point time series were converted to z-scores to remove seasonality and then smoothed using a centered 5-day moving average filter. the filter length was employed after examining various options because it represents a balance between high frequency weather events and more long-term (monthly to seasonal) trends. N\u2032 = adjusted degrees of freedom P = lag one temporal autocorrelation. N\u2032 was then adjusted again based on the length of the smoother employed to determine the final effective sample size. a Type I error rate of 0.05 was employed and Levene's test for equality of variances was used to determine if pooling was required. retrospective cohort study of pneumonia and influenza (P&I) mortality. daily frequencies of P&I mortality were tallied from national center for health statistics archives. this period of record spans three revisions of the ICD codes. multiple studies have shown that there exists a relationship between influenza morbidity and P&I mortality that can be mathematically described and used in epidemiological studies. daily deaths were aggregated into ten age groups and standardized via direct standardization [32] based on the age distribution of population of the united states in the year 2000. influenza in the summer months, June, July, and August were removed from the analysis as they had the potential to distort any relationships during the primary influenza season. a) daily age-standardized pneumonia and influenza mortality time series (deaths per million; June, July and August have been deleted) centered smoother is used to more clearly present peak times of mortality episodes. days or periods with z-scores>1 were identified as mortality \u201cevents\u201d or \u201cepisodes,\u201d respectively. we use 1200 and 1900 Universal Time Coordinate (UTC) air temperature (T) and dew point temperature (Td) to approximate the typical times of the warmest and coldest hours of the day (7 or 8 a.m. and 2 or 3 p.m. local time). we use dew point as a measure of the amount of moisture in the air because, unlike relative humidity, it is independent of air temperature [5]. if Moist Moderate air was present on average 30% of the time on January 1 over the period of record, then its occurrence on January 1, 2000 would result in a value of +0.7 for that day. daily air mass frequencies were converted from a nominal to a continuous variable by first adjusting for the long-term frequency on each day and then smoothing those frequencies using a 5-day moving average filter. we used a 17-day lag in which the mean for each variable was calculated across the days in the episode and the preceding 17 days. this lag was selected based on prior research that examined absolute humidity [6] and the results of other studies [43]. a type I error rate of 0.05 was used to determine the final effective sample size. the following tests were performed: smoothed temperature, dew point, and air mass frequency, lagged 17-days, between mortality events (z1) and non-events (z1) using an unpaired two-sample t-test. the same as in 1 for unsmoothed temperature and dew point temperature. results daily analyses In the daily analysis, 1200 UTC dew point temperature was significantly lower for events than for non-events. however, 1900 UTC dew point was higher during events (p = 0.036), a result that contradicts the hypothesis that drier conditions are related to enhanced P&I mortality. 0.026 0.001 0.000 n/a n/a n/a 0.000 Moist Polar 0.020 0.002 0.019 n/a n/a 0.015 Moist Tropical 0.000 0.001 0.691 n/a n/a n/a 0.931 Transition 0.009 0.001 0.484 n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a n/a 0.153 Mean values for events and non the longest episode (57 days in 1981) was associated with a dry period during which the mean dew point was more than 0.8\u00b0C below normal for that time of year. 2 of the three episodes with the lowest mortality also had dew points that were near normal, whereas higher mortality episodes exhibited drier conditions. 2-sample Smoothed 2-sample Unsmoothed 1-sample Event Non-Event p p 1200 UTC T 0.114 0.025 0.068 0.120 0.026 0.150 0.018 1200 UTC Td 0.72 0.003 0.003 0.003 0.383 0.248 0.028 0.000 1900 UTC T 0.012 0.028 0.725 0.012 0.029 0.767 0.783 1900 UTC Td 0.05 z-score values for events in the 1-sample test are the same as in column 2. 1200 UTC temperature and dew point were significantly lower during high P&I mortality events. no relationship was found for dry polar (DP) air (p = 0.277) a correlation between dry air and influenza mortality is consistent with the dew point results. the average morning dew point in Moist Polar air in New York City is lower than for any air mass other than Dry Polar (Table 4).
