{"summary": "interleukin-27 is an IL-6/IL-12 family heterodimeric cytokine composed of the IL-27p28 and EBV-induced gene 3 (EBI3) subunits (1, 2). it is produced by activated APC and exhibits critical immune-regulatory properties during both infection as well as autoimmunity (1, 2). IL-27 initially was considered a proinflammatory Th1-polarizing cytokine because of its ability to increase sensitivity of CD the role of IL-27 in the regulation of Treg remains unclear. only a subset of Treg expresses the IL-27R (10, 14) and IL-27 negatively regulates Foxp3 expression (12) but conversely amplifies TGF-induced Foxp3 expression (15) IL-27 may be dispensable for Treg homeostasis under steady state conditions. iFN- and IL-10, both potentially regulated by IL-27, are highlighted in the murine neurotropic coronavirus model of encephalomyelitis. the complex roles of IFN- and IL-10 are highlighted in the murine neurotropic coronavirus model of encephalomyelitis. despite constituting a source of IL-10, Treg have only a minimal ability to limit the clearance of infectious virus or regulate subsequent CNS demyelination (36). this suggests that viral persistence and demyelination are facilitated via suppression of the adaptive immune response by a Foxp3IL-10+CD4+ T cell population reminiscent of IL-27\u2013dependent type 1 regulatory T cells. female and male mice at 6 wk of age were infected intracranially with 1000 PFU of the sublethal glial tropic mAb-selected J2.2v-1 variant of JHMV. mice were scored daily for clinical signs of encephalitis as follows: 0, healthy; 1, hunched back; 2, partial hind limb paralysis or reduced ability to regain an upright position. supernatants were analyzed for virus by plaque assay on monolayers of the continuous Delayed Brain Tumor astrocytoma cell line as described (36, 38). single cell suspensions from the cervical lymph nodes were prepared from infected individual mice as described previously (36, 38). surface marker expression was examined using mAb purchased from BD Biosciences (San Diego, CA) intracellular cytokine expression was detected using FITC or PE mAb specific for IFN- (XMG1.2; BD Biosciences) and allophycocyanin-conjugated mAb specific for IL-10 (JES5-16E3; eBioscience) cell staining for Foxp3 (FJK-16a; eBioscience) was performed. 510\u2013coated targets were labeled with 2.5 M CSFE. uncoated control targets were labeled with 0.125 M CFSE. cells were harvested and acquired on a flow cytometer. s, spinal cords, and CLN were homogenized in TRIzol. RNA was precipitated with isopropyl alcohol, washed with 75% ethanol. cDNA was eliminated using a DNA-free kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) cells stained for expression of CD45 and F4/80 to separate infiltrating monocyte/macrophages (CD45hiF4/80+) from microglia. Typical yields for six to seven brains were 400,000\u2013600,000 macrophages or microglia. sections were incubated with anti-JHMV mAb J.3.3 specific for the viral N protein. a p value 0.05 was considered statistically significant. female and male mice at 6 wk were infected intracranially with 1000 PFU of the sublethal glial tropic mAb-selected J2.2v-1 variant of JHMV. cells were collected from 30/70% interphase, washed, and analyzed phenotypically by flow cytometry and functionally for cytolytic activity. supernatants were analyzed for virus by plaque assay on monolayers of the continuous Delayed Brain Tumor astrocytoma cell line as described. the presence or absence of either 5 M M133 peptide to stimulate CD4+ or 0.5 M S510 peptide to stimulate CD8+ T cells in RPMI 1640 medium. after stimulation, cells were stained for surface expression of CD4, CD8 and CD45, fixed, and permeabilized using a Cytofix/Cytoperm kit (BD Biosciences) jugated mAb specific for phosphorylated STAT1 for 60 min at room temperature (pY701; BD Biosciences) events were acquired on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) and analyzed. EL4 (H-2b) targets were pulsed with virus-specific peptide. anti-IFN- mAb (XMG1.2; BD Biosciences) and avidin-HRP followed by avidin-HRP. Optical densities were read at 450 nm in a bio-Rad model 680 microplate reader. gene expression Brains, spinal cords, and CLN were homogenized in TRIzol (invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) cells were separated from myelin debris by centrifugation on a 30/70% Percoll step gradient. cells were stained for expression of CD45 and F4/80 to separate infiltrating monocyte/macrophages (CD45hiF4/80+) from microglia. spinal cord sections of all six levels per individual mouse were scanned with an AperioScanScope (Vista, CA) at 40, digitally imaged at a high resolution, and scored in a blind manner for inflammation, demyelination, and viral Ag. a p value 0.05 was considered statistically significant. levels peaked in the CNS at day 7 p.i. coincident with peak cellular inflammation. expression of IL-12p35 component of IL-35 in the infected CNS remained unchanged. expression of IL-27 in brain was maximal coincident with peak cellular inflammation. IL-27 is primarily produced by APC (1, 2). CNS resident microglia and infiltrating monocytes constitute the vast majority of APC within the CNS following JHMV infection. expression of IL-27p28 mRNA was readily detected in microglia of naive mice at levels exceeding basal levels in total CNS derived RNA. IL-27 increases morbidity independent of CNS cellular inflammation or IFN- JHMV infection causes a sublethal encephalomyelitis. IL-27 increases morbidity independent of CNS cellular inflammation or IFN- JHMV infection causes a sublethal encephalomyelitis. inflammatory cells declined in IL-27R/ mice after the acute phase but were sustained during viral persistence. alterations in inflammatory cell composition were assessed as reduced clinical symptoms did not correlate with decreased inflammation. however, the relative frequencies of both T cells within the infiltrating population were not altered. the frequency of CNS-derived CD8+ T cells secreting IFN- was moderately increased in the absence of IL-27 signaling. the frequency of CD8+ T cells secreting IFN- was moderately increased in the absence of IL-27 signaling. decreased clinical disease during encephalomyelitis in absence of IL-27 signaling therefore does not correlate with reduced T cell\u2013dependent IFN- production within CNS. IL-27 delays virus control Morbidity is not only associated with CNS IFN-, a major effector of viral clearance, but also with virus replication. IL-27 delays virus clearance. Virus titers in the brains of wt and IL-27R/ mice. IL-27 induces IL-10 in virus-specific CD4+ but not CD8+ T cells. infected IL-27R/ mice expressed significantly less IL-10 mRNA in the CNS. however, IL-10 mRNA expression reached similar low levels in both groups by day 10 p.i. both groups maintained low IL-10 mRNA levels throughout viral persistence. IL-10+IFN-+ virus\u2013specific CD4+ T cells from the CNS of wt and IL-27R/mice analyzed by flow cytometry. data in (C) and (D) represent mean SD of two to three combined experiments. ability of IL-27 to activate STAT-1 phosphorylation in activated CNS-derived CD4+ T cells was reduced. naive splenic CD4+ T cells still exhibited a detectable response to IL-27. by day 21 p.i., a modest responsiveness was recovered. IL-27 enhances viral induced pathology without altering viral persistence. sterile immunity is not achieved resulting in viral persistence. expression of viral RNA encoding the N protein was decreased at days 10\u201314 p.i.. expression during persistence at day 21 p.i. was independent of IL-27 signaling. data in (A) and (B) represent mean SEM of two combined experiments. data in (C) represent mean SEM of two combined experiments with at least three individuals per group. differences in neutralizing Ab were detected when comparing the two groups. IL-27 signaling is associated with limiting pathological changes within the CNS following both parasite infection and autoimmune-mediated demyelination (2, 27\u201329) the extent of demyelination was quantified. in mice deficient in EBI3 (37), the common chain shared by IL-27 and IL-35 implicated IL-27 and/or IL-35 as a critical regulator of an otherwise sublethal encephalomyelitis. however, the relative expression and kinetics of IL-27 in the CLN, the site of lymphocyte activation following CNS infection, or the CNS during JHMV infection are unknown. IL-27 can exert regulatory function in both the CLN and the CNS during JHMV-induced encephalomyelitis. data represent average expression SEM in four individuals per time point. expression of IL-27p28 mRNA in microglia (CD45lowF4/80+) and macrophage (CD45hiF4/80+) purified from the naive and infected CNS. peak early expression of IL-27 in CNS-infiltrating monocytes resembled the overall kinetics in CLN. Alternatively, infiltrating monocytes express higher basal levels of IL-27p28 than microglia. however, analysis of IL-27p28 mRNA in bone marrow\u2013derived macrophages suggested basal levels were similar or even lower than microglia. similar survival rates of 95% in IL-27R/ and wt mice contrasted with mortality evident following JHMV infection of mice (37). clinical symptoms were even reduced compared with wt mice and declined more rapidly in the absence of IL-27 signaling. initiation of clinical symptoms during JHMV infection correlates with a vigorous inflammatory response. IL-27 increases disease severity and limits inflammation. progression of clinical symptoms in wt and IL-27R/ mice infected with JHMV. increased frequencies of IFN-\u2013producing T cells following ex vivo stimulation supported enhanced differentiation, expansion, and/or survival of virus-specific T cells. IFN- was maximal in both groups of mice at day 7 p.i. and rapidly declined by day 10 p.i. IL-27 delays virus control Morbidity is associated with CNS IFN-. virus replication initially was similar to wt mice (days 5 and 7 p.i.); however, by day 10 p.i., infectious virus was eliminated from the CNS of all IL-27R/ mice. IL-27 induces IL-10 in virus-specific CD4+ but not CD8+ T cells. IL-27 also induces subsets of T cells to secrete IL-10 (2). infected wt mice expressed significantly less IL-10 mRNA in the CNS. IL-27 induces IL-10 expression by virus-specific CD4+ T cells. IL-10 mRNA expression within the CNS of wt and IL-27R/mice at various times postinfection. STAT-1 phosphorylation analyzed by flow cytometry in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from naive spleen or the infected CNS of wt mice at various times postinfection. earlier and enhanced upregulation of IL-27 mRNA in CLN relative to the CNS after JHMV infection suggested that IL-27 may exert effects on T cells during both the priming and effector phases. IL-27 signaling accounts for the majority of virus-specific IL-10+IFN-+CD4+ T cells. the differential ability of IL-27 to influence CD4+, but not CD8+ T cells, was thus independent of overall IL-27 responsiveness. IL-10 mRNA expression was reduced in spinal cords of infected mice lacking IL-27 signaling during the early chronic phase of infection. levels were only marginally different by day 21 p.i. to determine whether decreased IL-10 mRNA reflected a decrease in Treg. the number of foci of infected cells was reduced in the infected IL-27R/ mice. the infected cells exhibited morphology consistent with oligodendroglia. too few virus-infected cells were present at day 21 p.i. to confirm the viral mRNA analysis. IL-27 impairs viral control in the CNS by induction of IL-10 in virus-specific CD4+ T cells. the distinct and even opposing effects of IL-27 signaling on T cell function in different infections may reflect differences in the anatomical effector site of IL-27. this is consistent with the limited ability of activated T cells within the CNS to respond to IL-27 compared with peripheral naive T cells. the rapid emergence of IL-10+CD4+ T cells in the CNS of wt-infected mice (34), which is dramatically reduced in the absence of IL-27 signaling. however, additional effects on early infiltrating T cells can not be excluded. IL-27 has also been associated with increased CD8+ T cell effector function during acute lung infection via promoting IFN- and IL-10 secretion (20, 21, 24) the absence of IL-27 signaling alone only reduced IL-10 secretion by virus-specific CD4+ T cells but not CD8+ T cells. IL-35+CD4+ T cells have been described in patients with chronic hepatitis (56), suggesting IL-35 may be an important regulator of established immune responses. the precise mechanisms of JHMV-induced demyelination are unclear, yet both infection of oligodendrocytes and T cell responses are absolute requirements (30) limited IL-27 responsiveness during JHMV persistence predicted by downregulated IL-27R expression on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. IL-27 also induces a subset of IL-27R+ Treg to express IFN- and CXCR3 which are implicated in immune suppression at the site of infection."}
