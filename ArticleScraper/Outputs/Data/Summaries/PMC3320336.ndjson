{"summary": "in the united states, an estimated 1 million people are infected with HIV. in the united states, an estimated 1 million people are infected with the disease. in the united states, an estimated 1 million people are infected with the disease. NIAID has funded >70 clinical trials evaluating >50 different HIV vaccine candidates. many different vaccine strategies, including viral and bacterial vectors, DNA vaccines, viruslike particle vaccines, and peptide vaccines are being investigated. a critical and so far elusive milestone is the discovery of a stable and immunogenic conformational epitope of the HIV envelope. drug-resistant Plasmodium strains are widespread, as are insecticide-resistant strains of the mosquitoes that carry the parasites. resistance to chloroquine and other antimalarials is caused by a mutation in a single gene, called pfcrt (14,15) this information is being used to track the spread of drug-resistant strains of the parasite and identify new drug targets. 8 million new cases of TB develop worldwide each year that carry a death toll of >2 million (3,6). the only currently available TB vaccine, M. bovis bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), offers some protection, but its effect diminishes with time (20) TB drug treatment is effective, but adherence to lengthy therapeutic regimens is difficult to maintain. in 1918, a pandemic of the \"Spanish Flu\" killed 20\u201350 million people worldwide. the virus could acquire characteristics that allow it to be readily transmitted among humans. this could lead to a worldwide influenza pandemic. researchers recently showed that the hemagglutinin gene from the 1918 virus conferred a high degree of pathogenicity to avirulent influenza strains when introduced into mice. these recombinant viruses and others are being evaluated in various animal models, including nonhuman primates, to further determine how genes of the 1918 virus contributed to its ability to spread so rapidly. in product is being tested in hospitalized patients who are at high risk for or who have WNV encephalitis (36) technology also developed to screen large numbers of chemical compounds for antiviral activity. as of February 2005, 1,500 compounds had been screened in vitro. 2% were shown to have antiviral activity against WNV. at least 1 of the 500 compounds with activity against SARS-CoV has been selected as a candidate for further clinical development. NIAID also has been very active in vaccine development as well as in vaccine development. the institute has supported the development of a next-generation anthrax vaccine. it is undergoing clinical trials, and contracts for the strategic national stockpile to acquire it have recently been awarded. several new smallpox vaccines also are being tested for safety and efficacy. the past 10 years have been challenging but no more so than will be the future. the past 10 years have been challenging but no more so than will be the future."}
