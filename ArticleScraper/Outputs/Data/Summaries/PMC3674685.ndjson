{"summary": "avian influenza virus is an important concern to the poultry industry. low pathogenic strains cause a disease that is seldom fatal. low pathogenic strains cause a disease that is rarely fatal. low pathogenic strains cause a disease that is rarely fatal. L. lactis does not colonize the oral cavity or gastrointestinal tract. it is thought noncolonizing bacteria may be preferred over commensal bacteria for vaccine delivery. the closely related Streptococcus genus is abundant in chicken gastrointestinal contents. 10xM2e was cloned into the lactococcal expression vector pP16pip. pBG-10xM2e was transformed into the plasmid-free strain L. lactis LM2301 [34] using standard methods. dilutions of washed cells were added to a 96-well microtiter plate. plates were read in a Tecan Infinite F500 plate reader. plates were read in a Tecan Infinite F500 plate reader. each sample was analyzed at three dilutions in duplicate. 2.6. Cell-Mediated Immune Response A lymphocyte proliferation assay performed as described. peripheral lymphocytes isolated from blood collected 14 days after final vaccination. tracheal swabs were collected by inserting a calcium alginate fiber-tipped applicator swab into the trachea and moving the swab 10 times up and down about 1 cm. the swab was immediately placed in 1 mL minimal essential medium (Life Technologies) plus streptomycin (100 g/mL), penicillin (100 units/mL), and amphotericin B (0.25 g/mL a 1 : 10 dilution series of each sample was prepared in PBS. plates were fixed with formalin and stained with crystal violet. plaques were counted after 72 h at 37\u00b0C + 5% CO2. protein and nucleic acid sequence of coding region of 10xM2e used for expression in L. lactis. bases in italics were added to the ends of the coding region for 10xM2e. anti-M2e serum and preimmune serum, goat-anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate and chemiluminescent substrate were read in a Tecan Infinite F500 plate reader. the plates were developed with goat antichicken IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate and chemiluminescent substrate. six seventeen-day-old Neo Brown chickens were vaccinated subcutaneously on the back of the neck with a 1: 1 mixture of Titermax Gold adjuvant and 50 g M2e equivalent KLH-M2e conjugate. a negative control group of six seventeen-day-old Neo Brown chickens was not vaccinated. birds were challenged intranasally 2 weeks after vaccination with 1 104 egg infectious dose of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus A/chicken/Pennsylvania/1370/1983 (H5N2) in 100 L PBS using a micropipettor to deliver the virus into the nasal opening. body weight and cloacal temperature were recorded daily. rum means and tracheal plaques were compared using two-tailed, unpaired Student's t-test with Welch's correction. survival was analyzed by the method of Kaplan and Meier using the logrank test. temperature and weight change was analyzed using nonparametric ANOVA. expression of M2e protein on the surface of LL vector with no M2e gene was not detected using preimmune and polyclonal antibodies. the signal was developed with secondary antibody anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate and chemiluminescent substrate. six chickens were vaccinated with LL-M2e, which formed a negative control group. none of the birds in the nonvaccinated group showed an M2e-specific humoral response. serum was collected 1 week after final vaccination and analyzed for M2e-specific serum IgG. each sample was analyzed at two or three different dilutions. n = 12 (LL-M2e), n = 6 (KLH-M2e and nonvaccinated) errors indicate standard deviation. weight loss for each bird was calculated as a difference compared to day 0, and the group mean is shown. an analysis of the group vaccinated with LL-M2e showed a significant correlation for the group vaccinated with LL-M2e. the correlation was not statistically significant (P > 0.05, data not shown) e protein on the surface of LL-M2e was measured by ELISA assay. expression of M2e protein on the surface of LL vector with no M2e gene was not detected using preimmune and polyclonal antibodies. expression of M2e protein on the surface of LL vector with no M2e gene was not detected using preimmune and polyclonal antibodies. 8 of 12 birds vaccinated with LL-M2e had a measurable humoral response. none of the birds in the nonvaccinated group showed an M2e-specific humoral response. n = 12 (LL-M2e), n = 6 (KLH-M2e and nonvaccinated) birds were challenged with high pathogenic avian influenza H5N2 (A/chicken/Pennsylvania/1370/1983) s vaccinated with LL-M2e or KLH-M2e had a median survival time of 3.5 days. two of 12 birds from the LL-M2e group survived and 2 of 6 birds from the KLH-M2e group survived. there was no statistical difference in survival between the two vaccinated groups. antibodies against M2e reduce infection and protect against viral replication and death, at least in mammalian models. current vaccines and natural infection induce a humoral response to two immunodominant viral surface antigens, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) vaccinated chickens developed an M2e-specific serum IgG response. the lack of robust M2e-specific fecal IgA or CD4+ T lymphocyte response could be due to differential processing of antigen by the immune system. this indicates that LL-M2e induced humoral response, but less significant cellular response. some studies show antibodies to M2e provide protection from infectious challenge. some studies show that antibodies to M2e provide protection."}
