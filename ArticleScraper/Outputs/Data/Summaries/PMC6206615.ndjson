{"summary": "crimean\u2013Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a negative-sense RNA virus in the Nairoviridae family. CCHFV contains three genomic segments: small and medium. a large segment encodes the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase. CCHFV was first described in humans in the 1940s when soldiers re-occupying abandoned farmland in the Crimea became ill with a hemorrhagic isolates differ at the amino acid level by 5% in the nucleoprotein and L protein. isolates differ at the amino acid level by 5% in the nucleoprotein and L protein. up to 25% in the glycoprotein precursor 3 are ticks of the Hyalomma genus. subclinical or mild cases of CCHFV may go unnoticed. high viral loads, absence of early antibody responses, and high levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are common predictors of poor outcome 10\u201314. Thrombocytopenia and prolonged clotting times are also seen in severe and fatal CCHF cases 16\u201319. the ability of CCHFV to cause severe or lethal disease in mice deficient in the type I interferon system but not wild-type (WT) mice 23\u201325 suggests that innate immune responses in vertebrate hosts play a substantial role in limiting CCHFV pathogenesis. innate immune responses in vertebrate hosts play a substantial role in limiting CCHFV pathogenesis. the CCHFV OTU domain can also cleave interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) modifications 37, 38. the de-ISGylation activity of the CCHFV OTU domain may be important for viral pathogenesis. the role for adaptive immune responses against CCHFV in human pathogenesis is less clear. studies evaluating a modified vaccinia virus-based vaccine for CCHFV found protection to require both cellular and humoral responses. levels of circulating CD3 +CD8 + T cells in peripheral blood were found to positively correlate with fatal outcome 46. human leukocyte antigen alleles have also been found to correlate with protection and susceptibility to CCHFV 48. CCHFV is directly capable of causing liver damage independent of host adaptive immune response\u2019s attempts to control viral replication. cynomolgus macaque model of CCHF 51 may provide insight into the role of adaptive immune response and disease outcome. a mouse model using the interferon blockade antibody MAR1-5A3 has been developed, allowing transient blockade of interferon signaling in a variety of mouse genetic backgrounds 50, 56. this model also allows the vaccination of fully immunocompetent animals that are rendered interferon deficient only at the time of CCHFV challenge. humanized mouse model identified strain-specific virulence with humanized mice infected with a Turkey strain of CCHFV succumbing 2 to 3 weeks PI. mice infected with an Oman strain survived until the study endpoint 49. cynomolgus macaques infected with a human clinical isolate recapitulate many aspects of human CCHF cases 51. a tick transmission model involving infected ticks feeding on mice has recently shown that CCHFV genetic diversity may be shaped by the tick reservoir rather than the vertebrate hosts 60. a modified vaccinia virus expressing the glycoproteins of CCHFV was shown to provide 100% protection to lethally challenged mice 44. CCHFV was also found to be protective against CCHFV infection in mice 55. vaccination with an adenovirus expressing the nucleoprotein of CCHFV provided substantial protection against lethal CCHFV challenge in mice 67. a modified vaccinia virus expressing the nucleoprotein failed to protect against lethal CCHFV challenge 68. the inconsistent data on the clinical benefit of ribavirin for the treatment of CCHFV and potential adverse events with ribavirin treatment have caused significant debate in the field 78\u201381. studies in mouse models have also shown inconsistent efficacy of ribavirin. favipiravir is approved in japan for the treatment of influenza virus infections 83 but has shown promise against other highly pathogenic RNA viruses, including Ebola 84 and Lassa 85, 86. two studies have evaluated favipiravir against CCHFV in vivo. monoclonal antibodies have shown efficacy against CCHFV in vivo 43. several clones were shown to neutralize divergent CCHFV strains 89. the toolset for studying CCHFV has been steadily improving in recent years with the development of mouse and non-human models. national veterinary institute, Uppsala, Sweden Dennis A Bente, department of microbiology & immunology."}
