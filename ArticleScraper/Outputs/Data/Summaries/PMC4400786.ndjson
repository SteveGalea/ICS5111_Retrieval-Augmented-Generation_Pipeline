{"summary": "infected herds had clinical signs of acute watery diarrhea in sows and nursing pigs. mortality was found only in nursing pigs. there is no evidence that PDCoV is transmissible to humans. PDCoV strains HKU15-44 and HKU15-155 were identified in fecal and intestinal samples from pigs with diarrheal disease in Ohio. PDCoV was also detected in 6 farms in Ontario, Canada, in march 2014. a real-time reverse transcription-PCR method was developed by Marthaler et al. (9) to detect PDCoV. but other virological and serological diagnostic assays are lacking. a critical step in the development of PDCoV diagnostic assays is the isolation of PDCoV in cell culture. the collected samples were tested for PDCoV by using qRT-PCR. the samples were tested for other swine enteric viruses, including PEDV, rotavirus group A (Rota A) to Rota C, TGEV/porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), and caliciviruses. a PDCoV and PEDV were detected by qRT-PCR. the percentage of PDCoV-positive piglet clinical samples (13/42) was 31%. the original samples were diluted 10-fold with phosphate-buffered saline. the LIC of pig 1 was designated OH-FD22(DC44) and was used as the inoculum for virus isolation in cell culture. the pig was reinoculated intramuscularly with the virus mixed with Freund's incomplete adjuvant (Sigma-Aldrich) LLC-PK cells were grown in MEM supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), 1% antibiotic-antimycotic (Gibco, USA), and 1% l-glutamine (Gibco, USA) one- or two-day-old, 80% confluent cell monolayers were used for virus inoculation. titration was performed by qRT-PCR, 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) and plaque assays. the additives and conditions were as follows: trypsin (Gibco, USA) was added at a final concentration of 10 g/ml. qRT-PCR was performed by using the Qiagen OneStep RT-PCR kit. the results were analyzed by using the system software. the RT-PCR method was also applied by amplifying a 541-bp fragment of the M gene that covered the qRT-PCR-amplified fragment. the virus inoculum was removed and cells were washed 2 times with Dulbecco's PBS (DPBS) without Mg2+ and Ca2+ (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) an equal volume of 3% seaPlaque agarose was mixed with 2 MEM (Gibco, USA) containing 1% antibiotic-antimycotic, HEPES, NEAA, and 2% pancreatin. LLC-PK cells were seeded into 96-well plates. one hundred microliters of 10-fold dilutions of PDCoV was inoculated. virus titers were calculated by using the Reed-Muench method. PDCoV-infected ST and LLC-PK cell culture media were clarified by centrifugation at 1,847 g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. after filtration through 0.45-m filters, the virus medium was further ultracentrifuged at 106,750 g for 2 h at 4\u00b0C by using an ultracentrifuge. purified samples were incubated with the OH-DC97 antiserum overnight at 4\u00b0C. primers PDCoV-NF1 and PDCoV-NR1 were designed according to the sequence of the PDCoV strain Illinois121/2014. the RNA was converted to cDNA by using an oligo(dT)-priming strategy (Invitrogen) the genes were amplified by using PrimeSTAR GXL DNA polymerase (TaKaRa Bio Inc., Japan) phylogenetic trees were constructed using the maximum likelihood method with MEGA6.06 software. Bootstrap analysis was carried out on 1,000 replicate data sets. 10 samples (PDCoV positive only) were selected for isolation of PDCoV in cell culture. PDCoV strain OH-FD22 from farm SF-OH had the highest viral RNA titer of these 10 samples. the original samples were diluted 10-fold with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), vortexed, and centrifuged at 1,847 g for 10 min. the supernatant was filtered through a 0.22-m syringe filter (Millipore, USA) and used as the inoculum for the Gn pigs or for virus isolation in cell culture. the pig was euthanized after 1 week, and PDCoV antiserum was collected and designated OH-DC97. the OH-FD22(DC44) sample was diluted 10-fold with minimum essential medium (MEM). the supernatant was filtered by using a 0.22-m syringe filter. 1% HEPES for ST cells and MEM supplemented with 1% antibiotic-antimycotic, 1% NEAA, and 1% HEPES for LLC-PK cells. after adsorption for 60 min at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2, cells were washed 3 times, and maintenance medium was added. cell cultures were observed for cytopathic effect (CPE) the SIC were prepared in our laboratory as described previously by Flynn and Saif (18) the small intestinal contents of a 9-day-old uninfected Gn pig were collected aseptically, diluted 1:10 in PBS, clarified by low-speed centrifugation, and filtered through a 0.45-m-pore-size filter. the viral RNA was extracted from the intestinal content suspensions, rectal swab fluids, feces, and cell culture the PCR products were purified by using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA, USA) the detection limit of qRT-PCR was 10 GE per reaction, corresponding to 4.6 log10 GE/ml. a plaque assay for PDCoV was developed with modifications of an assay for PEDV described previously. the plaques were counted under oblique light and confirmed by using a light microscope (CK2; Olympus, Japan) for virus plaque purification, uniform and clear plaques were picked by using sterile pipette tips. the OH-DC97 hyperimmune antiserum (diluted 1:100) was used as the primary antibody. plates were washed 6 times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. cell staining was examined by using a fluorescence microscope. PDCoV S and N genes were amplified by using primers PDCoV-SF2 and PDCoV-SR2. the RNA was converted to cDNA by using an oligo(dT)-priming strategy (Invitrogen) the PCR program was as follows: 95\u00b0C for 5 min; 40 cycles of 98\u00b0C for 10 s, 55\u00b0C for 15 s, 68\u00b0C for 5 min for the S gene and 2 min for the N gene. the PCR products were ligated with the linearized pMiniT vector by using a PCR cloning kit (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA) a total of 59 samples were collected from 5 pig farms in Ohio and Indiana. 17 (29%) were positive for PDCoV. four (80%) of the farms had at least 1 PDCoV-positive sample. PDCoV (OH-FD22 strain) was successfully isolated in cell culture from the intestinal contents of a piglet from farm SF-OH. PDCoV from the first passage on LLC-PK cells was designated OH-FD22-P0. 8.5 10.1 9.1 8.6 8.8 NT NT P14 8.9 NT NT NT 10 10.5 8.8 P15 9.5 8 7.8 10.6 9.6 9.9 NT NT P16 9.9 9.9 7.9 10 10.5 7.2 9.9 10.5 8.5 P19 9.1 8.4 7.6 9.8 10.5 9.6 P20 8.9 7.5 7.1 10.2 10.9 9.2 a NT, not tested. the pancreatin or SIC/trypsin-treated groups showed earlier evident CPE than the trypsin (10 g/ml) treatment group. the virus titers (7 log10 PFU/ml) were lower than those for the trypsin (10 g/ml) treatment group (9 log10 PFU/ml) the PDCoV antigens were located mostly in the cytoplasm. OH-FD22-inoculated ST cells with 10% SIC plus 10 g/ml trypsin at p.i. day 2 showing cytopathic effects characterized by cell rounding. OH-FD22-inoculated ST cells with 10 g/ml trypsin at p.i. day 2 showing no CPE. IF staining of mock-inoculated LLC-PK cells showed no IF-positive cells. original magnification, 400. ST and LLC-PK cells inoculated with OH-FD22 were fixed at p.i. day 1. the samples were negatively stained with 3% phosphotungstic acid. harvested from the ST cells was designated OH-FD22-P0. when the OH-FD22-P0 virus was further passaged in ST cells, no viral titer increase was detected for the next 5 passages. different culture conditions were applied for the OH-FD22-P0 passages in ST cells. significant increases in virus RNA titers were observed following each cell passage compared with those at 0 hpi. however, the RNA virus titers in LLC-PK cells (9.7 to 10.6 log10 GE/ml; average of 10.2 log10 GE/ml) were usually higher than those in ST cells. the OH-FD22-P11 virus in LLC-PK cells (9.2 log10 PFU/ml) was used for plaque purification on ST cells. the plaque-purified virus OH-FD22(DC44)-P10 was serially passaged to P16 on LLC-PK cells (9.2 log10 PFU/ml) the field strain OH-FD22 had the highest nucleotide similarity (100%) with the Ohio HKU15-OH1987 strain. OH-FD22-P11 and -P20, passaged in both ST and LLC-PK cells, each had five nucleotide changes. these nucleotide changes all induced the corresponding amino acid changes. enetic tree was constructed by using the entire S gene sequences of 27 PDCoVs from this study. the trees were constructed by using the maximum likelihood method with MEGA6.06 software. bars represent 0.1 nucleotide substitutions (CoV S) or 0.2 nucleotide substitutions (CoV N) per site. the N genes of these sequenced samples were determined to be 1,029 nucleotides long, coding for a polypeptide of 342 amino acids. the N genes shared 100% nucleotide identities with each other. seven (41.2%) of the PDCoV-positive samples were positive for PEDV (3 samples) or Rota C (4 samples) only the OH-FD22-inoculated cell monolayers showed visible CPE in the form of enlarged, rounded cells at p.i. day 2 that rapidly detached from the monolayers on p.i. day 3. PDCoV from the first passage on LLC-PK cells was designated OH-FD22-P0. OH-FD22-P0 virus was further serially passaged in LLC-PK cells for a total of 20 passages (P1 to P20) different culture conditions were compared: cultures with or without exogenous trypsin, with the addition of SIC from healthy Gn pigs pre- or postinoculation. PDCoV replicated in LLC-PK cells without trypsin, but it did not induce visible CPE. the virus titer (5 log10 PFU/ml) was lower than that with trypsin (10 g/ml) treatment (9 log10 PFU/ml) LLC-PK or ST cells were inoculated with PDCoV OH-FD22-P19 with different additives (1% pancreatin, 10% SIC plus 10 g/ml trypsin, and 10 g/ml trypsin) at p.i. day 1 or 2, cytopathic effects were examined. OH-FD22-inoculated LLC-PK cells with 10 g/ml trypsin at p.i. day 2 showing rounded and detached cells. original magnification, 400. IF staining of OH-FD22-inoculated ST cells showing IF-positive staining mainly in the cytoplasm of infected cells. the viral RNA titers of OH-FD22(DC44) propagated in LLC-PK cells were similar (8.8 to 11.1 log10 GE/ml) to the OH-FD22 viral RNA titers. the original OH-FD22 sample was also inoculated onto ST cell monolayers. the OH-FD22 isolate was further serially passaged on ST cells for a total of 20 passages. distinct CPE, characterized by cell rounding, clumping together in clusters, and eventual detachment of cells, was usually observed on p.i. days 2 to 3. titers in the pancreatin- or SIC/trypsin-treated groups tested at p.i. day 3 were similar. the virus titers ranged from 7.2 to 9.6 log10 TCID50/ml in LLC-PK cells and from 6.5 to 8.5 log10 PFU/ml in ST cells. the OH-FD22(DC44) virus infectious titers were similar to those of the OH-FD22 strain in LLC-PK cells (7.2 log10 PFU/ml) all the sequenced S genes were 3,483 nucleotides long, encoding a protein of 1,161 amino acids (aa) the S genes of the field strain OH-FD22 had the highest nucleotide similarity (100%) with the Ohio HKU15-OH1987 strain. mutations observed at P11 were sustained through P20. the PDCoV S protein contained 27 potential glycosylation sites. no amino acid changes were located in any of the predicted N-linked glycosylation sites. Phylogenetic analyses of complete S and N gene nucleotide sequences of 7 PDCoVs from this study (indicated by triangles) the trees were constructed by using the maximum likelihood method with MEGA6.06 software (http://www.megasoftware.net/). prevalence of PDCoV in pigs in north America was reported to be >25% on the farms surveyed (4, 8, 9) higher rates of PDCoV positivity were reported in Ohio. despite rapid detection of PDCoV RNA sequences in the last 8 months, there are no published papers reporting the successful isolation of PDCoV. PDCoV OH-FD22 replicated in both ST and LLC-PK cells without trypsin. but it did not induce visible CPE, and virus titers were low. isolation procedures need to be improved to increase the rate of success of PDCoV isolation. SIC from a noninoculated Gn pig and trypsin were incorporated into the cell culture medium to support PDCoV propagation in ST cells. substances in SIC may be beneficial for PDCoV attachment to its receptor and/or virus entry or for other stages of the viral replication cycle. SIC of healthy Gn pigs is a complex mixture, and we did not determine which components exert growth effects. PDCoV still failed to grow in vero cells, even when high-titer PDCoV obtained from infected LLC-PK cells was used to inoculate Vero cells. the medium was supplemented with different additives (SIC, trypsin, and pancreatin) these results suggest PDCoV, TGEV, and PEDV share different cellular tropisms in vitro. PDCoV strains clustered into one clade in the genus deltacoronavirus. they were distinct from the avian deltacoronaviruses. these findings suggest that PDCoV strains currently circulating in multiple U.S. states are closely related. PDCoV strains OH-FD22 and OH-FD22(DC44) were isolated and serially passaged in cell culture and characterized. the full-length S and N genes were sequenced to study PDCoV genetic changes during passage in cell culture and pigs."}
