{"summary": "LLPCs are terminally differentiated, non-dividing cells that reside in the bone marrow. these antibodies are typically assessed by in vitro neutralization and binding assays. the specificity and breadth of potential MBC responses are increasingly appreciated. MBCs can be identified by their B-cell receptor (BCR), a membrane bound immunoglobulin (Ig) identical to the antibody they secrete upon activation. Upon reinfection, the recall response is rapid, dominated by high affinity isotype switched antibodies, IgG, IgA or IgE, depending on pathogen. secondary (2\u00b0) infection with a different serotype can lead to broader protection, up to all four serotypes, but comes at a greater risk of serious disease during acute infection. the mechanism by which subsequent broader immunity develops is incompletely understood. the relative contribution of type specific, weakly cross-neutralizing and broadly neutralizing antibodies to long-term immunity is unclear. methods to interrogate antigen-specific MBCs have had several useful functions. identifying subset of MBCs available to respond to repeat infections (27, 28), tracking MBCs prior to and after vaccination or booster (6), and isolating and characterizing human mAbs following natural infection or vaccination (29), and analyzing memory-derived antibody repertoire (28). only recently have these methods been employed in the DENV field. positive wells fused to generate hybridomas. >10-fold increase in the # of successful human hybridomas generated 12 6\u20131\u00b0 6\u20132\u00b0 4\u201324 years post-infection 37 29/37 isolated mAbs recognized E protein, 26 were IgG1 and 3 were IgG2 26/37 isolated mAbs were cross reactive, most bound to EDI/II 5- isolated mAbs EDIII specific. 64% of the sorted MBCs were positive for IgG, 20% were positive for DENV by ELISA, 8% secreted DENV2 specific mAbs Of the 9 mAbs isolated 1-non-neutralizing, 3-serotype-specific, 2-neutralized 2\u20133 serotypes 3-neutralized 4 serotypes. antibody containing supernatant or MBCs can be used for a wide range of assays including: ELISpot, ELISA, and neutralization. the major limitations of this approach are that the cells are not immortalized therefore longevity is limited, surface BCR is down-regulated, and single antigen-specific MBCs clones cannot be identified. hybridomas are made by fusing a myeloma cell with a B-cell from an immunized or naturally infected individual. the resulting hybrid cell secretes mAbs specific to their antigen. fusion efficiency improved from 0.001 (40) to 0.43% (41) which enabled them to isolate neutralizing mAbs against RSV and influenza. work by wahala et al. (43) found that humans and mice recognize distinct and different epitopes on the DENV virion following immunization in mice or natural infection in humans. almost all neutralizing antibodies found in humans after natural infection recognize complex quaternary epitopes on the surface of whole virions. BCL-6 + BCL-XL transduced cells express AICDA, encoding the enzyme activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), at the same levels as isolated tonsil derived GC B-cells. AID mediates somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class-switch recombination (CSR) using EBV-transformed human B-cells to generate human hybridomas can increase efficiency by as much as 25-fold compared to that of using untransformed PBMCs. a combination approach of EBV immortalization followed by fusion has been used to isolate human DENV-specific mAbs from naturally infected donors. a major strength of this approach is the possibility of tracking multiple serotypes of DENV-specific MBCs prior to and post infection or vaccination. PBMCs or enriched B-cells are stimulated ex vivo with a mitogen cocktail along with non-proliferating feeder cells. Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Spot Assay (ELISpot) provides a sensitive and specific tool to detect antigen-specific MBCs. first described over 35 years ago (36) as a method for quantifying rare B and T cells and is still widely used today. technical advances have made it feasible to generate hybridomas from human peripheral blood MBCs. these advances include expanding B-cells prior to fusion, finding new human myeloma cells to fuse with. fusion efficiency improved from 0.001 (40) to 0.43% (41) which enabled them to isolate neutralizing mAbs against RSV and influenza. B-Cell Immortalization MBC immortalization can be achieved through transforming peripheral MBCs using Epstein Barr Virus. this results in stable cell lines that express BCR on the surface and secrete antibodies, making them a useful tool in the generation of human mAbs. AID mediates somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class-switch recombination (CSR) low levels of SHM is observed in the Ig genes of expanded B-cells. these cells can be maintained for prolonged periods of time in culture to allow for mAb production. a combination approach of EBV immortalization followed by fusion has been used to isolate human DENV-specific mAbs from naturally infected or vaccinated donors (28, 55) the method enabled researchers to isolate 8 DENV-neutralizing mAbs from a single donor. single-cell RT-PCR approaches (64) allow for sequencing, cloning, and characterization of each BCR from individually sorted MBCs. this approach is time and resource intensive as it requires heavy and light chains to undergo PCR, sequencing, and cloning independently. high throughput methods that capture the entire antigen-specific MBC repertoire recently developed with other pathogens would be expected to advance the DENV field as well. mAbs from humans involves using microfluidics to partition individual cells then physically link heavy and light mRNAs and perform overlap extension PCR to generate a continuous heavy-light chain amplicon for cloning into a yeast display system. the ability to fully interrogate the MBC response established after natural infection to viral antigens will allow researchers to durably and comprehensively interrogate vaccine responses."}
