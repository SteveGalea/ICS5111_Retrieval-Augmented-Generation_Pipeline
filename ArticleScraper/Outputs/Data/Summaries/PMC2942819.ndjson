{"summary": "rheumatic fever, syphilis, cellulitis and bacterial pneumonia were common causes of death and disease in the pre-antibiotic era. the availability of antibiotics enabled revolutionary medical interventions such as cancer chemotherapy, organ transplants and essentially all major invasive surgeries. antibiotics are unique among drugs in that their use precipitates their obsolescence. resistance to antibiotics occurs through four general mechanisms: target modification; efflux; immunity and bypass; and enzyme-catalyzed destruction. target modification can occur through mutation of the targets themselves - for example, the topoisomerases that are the target of the fluoroquinolone antibiotics. many of the -lactamase genes that confer resistance to the penicillin, cephalosporin, penem and monobactam antibiotics are located on mobile genetic elements such as plasmids. the prevalence and mobility of resistance genes in previously sensitive pathogenic bacteria has reached crisis levels in many cases because new antibiotics are no longer being developed at a rate that can keep pace with microbial evolution. antibiotic resistance is the evolutionary response to the strong selective pressure that results from exposure to these compounds. the horizontal dissemination of resistance genes into bacterial species and genera that are not themselves intrinsically resistant is likely to be the result of contemporary use of these drugs in the clinic. antibiotics themselves are the source of evolutionary pressure that eventually render them obsolete. the inappropriate use of antibiotics by clinicians and the agricultural community needs to be curtailed. in the developing world, access to antibiotics is often not regulated and their use in agriculture is often rampant. antibiotic-resistant enterobacteria are one example of antibiotic-resistant enterobacteria. other Gram-negative pathogens resistant to virtually all antibiotics include multi-drug resistant A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa. the growing problem of MRSA requires new therapies. the first wave of antibiotics discovered five decades ago have been termed the 'low hanging fruit' despite the discovery of numerous compounds with antibiotic properties in the years since, few have had the requisite properties to become drugs. despite the discovery of numerous compounds with antibiotic properties in the years since, few have had the requisite properties to become drugs. natural-product-based screening programs have fallen out of favor in many pharmaceutical firms over the past few decades. the ability of parallel synthesis methods to generate hundreds of thousands of synthetic molecules suitable for modern high-throughput screening has shifted the focus in favor of synthetic molecules in commercial antibacterial drug discovery. a direct comparison of the success and failure of synthetic as against natural product libraries is unfair. secondary metabolites range in molecular weight from around 100 daltons (Da) to up to 5,000 Da. they include induction of cell death (antibiotics such as tetracycline, vancomycin and daptomycin), iron sequestration (for example, enterobactin), facilitation of cell-cell communication (-butyrolactones), protection from oxidizing agents (phenazines) natural-product biosynthetic clusters are being investigated. some of this diversity will include new antibiotic chemical scaffolds. existing discarded antibiotics can be re-examined. a second option is the combination of antibiotics with each other. we need antibiotics to maintain our current standard of health care. we need antibiotics to maintain our current standard of health care. stewardship alone cannot fulfill our requirement for new antibiotics. scientists, funders, industry, regulators and clinicians, I believe they can be overcome. \"where can I go for more information\" an update from the Infectious Diseases Society of America. an update from the Infectious Diseases Society of America. marine actinomycete bacteria are emerging pathogens. a molecular, biological, and epidemiological study. livermore DM: Has the era of untreatable infections arived. imipenem activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, produced by Penicillium radicum.
