{"summary": "a growing concern over the role of bioaerosols in spread of various airborne infections. the study was to analyze the number of colony forming units (CFUs) in bioaerosols generated during ultrasonic scaling. bioaerosols are defined as particles 50 m in diameter containing microorganisms in saliva, nasopharyngeal secretions and blood. plaque that are small enough to stay airborne for an extended period of time before they settle down on the environmental surface or enter the respiratory tract. blood agar plates were kept for 10 min in the four corners and in the middle of the closed room to collect bioaerosol samples. after 10 min, agar plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 48 h to allow for the growth of bacteria. after this, the culture plates were assessed for CFUs using manual colony counting device. cultures obtained with samples from 1 and 4 quadrants are presented in Figure 3. cultures obtained with samples from 1 and 4 quadrants are presented in Figure 3. cultures obtained with samples from 1 and 4 quadrants are presented in Figure 5. a regimen of 30s preprocedural rinse with 10 ml CHX (0.12%) before the ultrasonic scaling procedure significantly reduced the CFUs. the efficacy of CHX (0.12%) preprocedural rinse alone in reducing bioaerosol contamination during ultrasonic scaling procedure was assessed. log-colony forming units with and without use of HVE Comparison was also done between A versus B groups (P = 0.135) and B versus C groups (P = 0.411); however, a moderate statistical significance was found between A versus C groups (P = 0.043) during ultrasonic scaling procedure. a study using a similar protocol during scaling procedures showed that a 2 min prerinse with CHX significantly reduced the number of CFUs. this can be attributed to CHX (0.12%) being an effective antiseptic against free floating bacteria. this is the first ever study done where CFUs were assessed when a combination of CHX (0.12%) preprocedural rinse and HVE have been used. a significant reduction in CFUs was found in the first two groups. a significant reduction in the CFUs when a combination of both CHX (0.12%) and HVE were used. a combination of both CHX (0.12%) preprocedural rinse and HVE reduced bacterial contamination of bioaerosol more effectively than individual methods during ultrasonic scaling procedure."}
