{"summary": "pure RNA will have A260:A230 equal to A260:A280 and >1.8 (1). a second check involves electrophoresis, routinely performed using agarose gel electrophoresis, with RNA stained with ethidium bromide (etBr) or the more sensitive SYBR Green dye (10). the standard of a 2.0 rRNA ratio is difficult to meet, especially for RNA derived from clinical samples. it appears that total RNA with lower rRNA ratios is not necessarily of poor quality especially if no degradation products can be observed in the electrophoretic trace. standardized RNA quality assessment would allow a more reliable comparison of experiments and facilitate exchange of biological information within the scientific community. two software packages recently developed to gauge the integrity of RNA samples with a user-independent strategy. they were developed separately to extract information about RNA integrity from microcapillary electrophoretic traces. RNA extraction was carried out in an RNase-free environment. commercially available RNA samples were the \u2018Universal Human Reference\u2019 (N = 75) distributed by Stratagene (USA), and human brain (N = 2) and muscle (N = 2) RNAs supplied by Clontech (USA) total RNA sample within a discrete category from 1 to 5, examining the integrity of the RNA sample. a low number indicates high integrity. reference criteria parameters include ribosomal peaks definition, baseline flatness, existence of additional or noise peaks between ribosomal peaks. a fifth class labeled White (8) was introduced when no alert was produced by the software. software and manual are freely available at http://www.dnaarrays.org/downloads.php. an integer number in the range of 1\u201310 is returned for a completely degraded RNA sample. in some cases, the measured electropherogram signals are of an unusual shape, showing for example peaks at unexpected migration times, spikes or abnormal fluctuation of the baseline. 4.6 4.0 2.5 DegFact 4.9 4.8 5.5 5.2 5.0 6.9 6.1 6.8 13.1 11.6 12.3 16.6 16.1 22.3 26.0 30.5 HC Ref HC-level2-3 HC-level4 HC-level5 Samples are grouped in three quality categories (HC), according to both metrics, i.e. RIN and DegFact values. sample-n corresponds to any sample for the target gene normalized to the reference gene. mean 2Ct and SD were calculated, considering the samples individually or grouped by quality metrics categories. values of mean fold change should be very close to 1 (since 20 = 1) (27) RNA purification was performed by cesium chloride ultracentrifugation according to Chomczynski and Sacchi (26), by phenol-based extraction methods. material was maintained at 80\u00b0C with minimal handling. commercially available RNA samples were the \u2018Universal Human Reference\u2019 (N = 75) distributed by Stratagene (USA), and human brain (N = 2) and muscle (N = 2) RNAs supplied by Clontech (USA) RNA integrity checks were performed by experts who classified each total RNA sample within a discrete category from 1 to 5. a low number indicates high integrity. a smearing of either 28S and 18S peaks indicates degradation of the RNA sample. a new group of integrity is defined after 8 graduation steps. 4 groups of integrity are displayed, 3 showing an alert warning indicative of some measurable degradation. a fifth class labeled White (8) was introduced when no alert was produced by the software. the output RIN is a decimal or integer number in the range of 1\u201310: a RIN of 1 is returned for a completely degraded RNA sample. in some cases, the measured electropherogram signals are of an unusual shape. in such cases, a reliable RIN computation is not possible. 5.3 6.2 5.5 4.7 4.6 4.0 2.5 DegFact 4.9 4.8 5.5 5.2 5.0 6.9 6.1 6.8 13.1 11.6 12.3 16.6 22.3 26.0 30.5 HC Ref HC-level2-3 HC-level4 HC-level5 Samples are grouped in three quality categories (HC), according to both metrics. sample-n corresponds to any sample for the target gene normalized to the reference gene. mean 2Ct and SD were calculated, considering the samples individually or grouped by quality metrics categories. A260:A280 and 28S:18S ratio distributions were checked for 399 RNA sample profiles. rRNA area ratios were successfully computed from 348 RNA sample profiles. the distribution is represented by the number of records in each class. RNA integrity was assessed by resolving the 28S and 18S ribosomal RNA bands using the Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer and the RNA 6000 protocol. data from 15 samples was not obtained due to device problems during the runs. the system automatically provided 28S:18S ratios for 348 (87%) of the 399 profiles. a 28S:18S ratio of 2.0 denoted high quality for a majority of RNA samples, 91% being classified in HC-levels 1 to 3. 83% of total RNAs with 28S:18S 1.0 but a low baseline between the 18S and 5S rRNA or front marker were also classified in HC-levels 1\u20133. a total of 334 RNA profiles were successfully categorized into 5 predefined alert classes using a mathematical model that quantifies RNA degradation and computes a degradation factor (DegFact) four classes are associated with different levels of degradation. a fifth class, Black alert corresponds to samples that the system was not able to qualify with accuracy. over the 399 RNA profiles checked, 363 (91%) were scored successfully. the remaining 36 (9%) samples were associated with various unexpected signals, disturbing computation of the RIN using default anomaly detection parameters. a first group, corresponding to 295 (82%) of the 363 RNA profiles, was analyzed using the default settings of the RIN system. a lower threshold of RNA quantity loaded (20 ng) for reliable detection of anomalies than that recommended by the manufacturer (50 ng) a significant linear relationship was found between the RIN number and both the explicit human classification provided by our operators. RNA profiles were flagged Black by the degradometer software. human interpretations agreed in most cases, with 11% of inconsistency. both automated systems and human interpretations agreed. according to the 2Ct quantification method (see Materials and Methods), were found lower than 1.0, corresponding to the expression level (1) in the sample exhibiting the highest RNA quality (Table 2 and Figure 5). these results indicate that 2- to 7-fold differences may be expected in the relative expression levels of genes in samples that differ only by their quality. degFact 4.9 \u2014 1 1.00 \u2014 0.04 \u2014 1.1 5.8 0.6 7 0.69 0.08 0.03 31 [1.3\u20131.6] \u2014 1.3 1.1 13.9 1.8 5 0.31 0.05 0.01 69 [2.9\u20133.8] [1.8\u20133.0] \u2014 1.3 1.1 26.3 3.8 3 0.18 0.04 0.01 82 [4.5\u20137.4] [1.2\u20132.6] 1.6 1.2 The N-value corresponds to the number of samples by change (2Ct) of the RNA aliquots grouped by quality metrics categories, including (A) RIN number and (B) DegFact values. it would be expected that measuring expression of an intact mRNA would yield approximately equal results regardless of the region being probed. similar results were obtained for TFRC, with probes separated by 2066 nt (r = 0.84, parameter = 0.92, data not shown) the distribution of A260:A280 and 28S:18S ratios was not found to correlate with either purification methods or tissues of origin. rRNA area ratios were successfully computed from 348 RNA sample profiles by the Agilent biosizing software. 28S:18S ratio (19\u201324%) was found for identical samples from replicate runs (2\u201350 times) the integration failed in the remaining 51 cases, displaying an atypical migration. the integration failed in the remaining 51 cases, displaying an atypical migration, with no clear 28S and 18S rRNA bands. a low baseline between the 18S and 5S rRNA or front marker were also classified in HC-levels 1\u20133. over the 399 RNA profiles checked, all were scored in one of the five predefined classes. the remaining 65 RNA samples (16%) displaying profiles that could not be interpreted reliably. most of them correspond to samples previously classified as degraded (HC-level 5) the distribution is represented by the number of records in each class. rRNA peak heights and DegFact values were taken at each of the 5 HC levels. the distribution is represented by the number of records in each class. the remaining 36 (9%) samples were associated with various unexpected signals, disturbing computation of the RIN using default anomaly detection parameters. in each case, a flag alert was added corresponding to critical anomalies including unexpected data in sample type, (or) ribosomal ratio, (or) baseline and signal in the 5S region. each HC class corresponds to an explicit RIN number, with HC-levels 2 and 3 forming once again a single class. HC-level 1, mean RIN of 9.6, SD of 0.7 (IC 9.5\u20139.7), HC-level 2 and 3, mean RIN of 8.6, SD of 0.9 (IC 8.4\u20138.9), HC-level 4, mean RIN of 6.1, SD of 1.5 (IC 5.2\u20137.1); HC-level 5, mean RIN of 3 of them were estimated to range from high (HC-level 1; N = 12) to correct (HC-level 2 and 3; N = 12) quality levels. some slight degradation was detected, associated to a low mean DegFact value of 9.7. both automated systems and human interpretations agreed in most cases, with 11% of inconsistency. a gap in the distribution may be defined (Figure 5A and B), distinguishing the RNA samples of the higher quality categories (RIN 8 and DegFact values 7) from those of the lower categories (RIN 8 and DegFact values 12). Q-PCR results collected on three housekeeping genes (HGK)\u2014GAPD, GUSB and TFRC\u2014considering the sample aliquots grouped by quality metrics categories. observed technical variation (IC-rep, P = 0.05) is also specified. the reference sample exhibits a RIN of 9, a DegFact value of 4.9 and by default mean fold change set to 1. The observed decrease in the expression (relative expression, %) relative to the reference sample is calculated. the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 GUSB probes, separated by 1209 nt, were associated with highly similar threshold cycle (Ct) measures (r = 0.98, parameter = 0.92, data not shown) similar results were obtained for TFRC, with probes separated by 2066 nt (r = 0.84, parameter = 0.92, data not shown) samples displaying low A260:A230 ratios (1.8) did not exhibit any inhibition during downstream applications. the 28S:18S rRNA ratios may not be used as a gold standard for assessing RNA integrity. however, due to a lack of reliability, the 28S:18S rRNA ratios may not be used as a gold standard for assessing RNA integrity. human evaluation of the integrity of RNA through visual inspection of the electrophoresis profiles provided very consistent data. variability between classifications produced by five independent expert operators (CV 16%) was lower than with automated management of more conventional control 28S:18S area values (CV 19\u201324%). 5% of the set of RNA samples could not be allocated to any of the five predefined categories; their corresponding profiles were considered as atypical. the degradometer and RIN algorithms were highly reliable user-independent methods for automated assessment of RNA degradation and integrity. the system was able to compute assessment metrics for 91% of the RNA profiles, compared to 84% with the degradometer software. the degradometer software could classify only 44% of the samples. some studies report collection of reasonable microarray data from RNA samples of impaired quality (28) degradation does not preclude microarray analysis if comparison is done using samples of comparable RNA integrity. we confirmed the direct influence of the RNA quality on the distribution of gene expression levels. RNA-based bioassays performed across laboratories with RNA samples of similar quality, in much the same way as sequencing traces are compared. Integrity of the RNA, once extracted and purified from cell lines, clinical or biological tissues samples, is controlled from the widely used bioanalyzer electrophoretic traces."}
