{"summary": "HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE The quest for a suitable alternative for human blood dates back to the 17th century. the quest for a suitable alternative for human blood dates back to the 17th century when Sir Christopher Wren suggested the use of ale, wine and opium as blood substitutes. free haemoglobin was collected by lysing the red blood cells and transfusing the unmodified products in animals. this resulted in renal failure, coagulopathy, complement activation, antigenicity, antigenicity, histamine release, iron deposition and vasoconstriction. also the strong affinity of free haemoglobin for nitric oxide caused unopposed vasoconstriction and pressor response. marrow has regenerated sufficient RBC\u2019s. the main clinical indications of administration of artificial blood include: Trauma: For volume replacement and stabilization. Elective Surgery: Preoperative blood conservation in form of acute normovolemic haemodilution. HBOC\u2019s are derived from haemoglobin which is isolated or synthetically manufactured Fig. (1). the source of haemoglobin is either human, obtained from stored blood or bovine blood or genetically engineered. haemoglobin molecules are produced by attachment of large molecules like polyethylene glycol to surface lysine groups. this modification increases the viscosity and oncotic pressure of the solution. these solutions have the propensity to cause moderate vasoconstriction. emoglobin is re-encapsulated in a stable lipid membrane. liposomes are made of phospholipid bilayer with cholesterol molecules added for increasing rigidity and mechanical stability. ultraviolet radiations or redox inhibitors are used which causes polymerization of unsaturated phospholipids. the first choice for obtaining haemoglobin is outdated human blood which has a limited supply. bovine haemoglobin has the potential of harbouring prion pathogen responsible for causing bovine spongiform encephalopathy (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease) PERFLUOROCARBON (PFC) BASED PRODUCTS PFCs are chemically inert molecules with structural similarity to hydrocarbons. their size is about 100 times smaller than RBC\u2019s. they are capable of carrying oxygen and carbon dioxide without binding to these gases. perfluorodecalin, perfluorooctyl bromide and bis (perfluorobutyl) ethylene belong to this class. their oxygen carrying capacity is substantially higher than the first generation PFC. higher rate of neurological complications have been found in human cardiac surgery cases. higher extraction rates and ratios of PFC\u2019s allow for reaching 90% of the oxygen carrying capacity compared to 25-30% for haemoglobin. the gap between the increasing demand of human blood and the limited supply continues to widen. the existing varieties of artificial blood only serve for oxygen transport, delivery and volume expansion. hyperoxic ventilation in combination with small boluses of PFC\u2019s can maintain adequate tissue oxygenation intraoperatively in surgeries with anticipated major blood loss. artificial blood substitutes are not devoid of their share of complications. commonly observed side effects include increase in systemic and pulmonary arterial resistance, decreased cardiac output, jaundice, increased activities of enzymes like amylase, lipase or transaminases. the increased levels reflect clinical pancreatitis or is an error of interference with the photoelectric detector is still speculative. a new avenue in the field of transfusion medicine is thus open to immense possibilities.
