{"summary": "two experienced radiologists reviewed chest radiographs of 28 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome. each lung was divided into upper, middle, and lower zones. a SARS-related lesion in each zone was scored using a four-point scale. all subjects experienced fevers exceeding 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F) and fulfilled the WHO criteria for probable SARS (9) all 28 patients were shown to have significant seroconversion of the SARS-coV antibody indicating arecent infection by the coronavirus. 12 patients had lived in an area in which community transmission of SARS was documented. the radiographic findings were recorded without the knowledge of the clinical data but with the knowledge that the patients were victims of suspicious or probable cases of SARS. each lung was divided into upper, middle and lower lung zones transversely, with each zone spanning one-third of the craniocaudal length of the lung. a chest radiograph in the posteroanterior projection obtained 4 days after fever onset shows a subtle ground glass density in the lateral aspect of the right upper lung (arrows) a close-up view of a follow-up chest radiograph in the anteroposterior projection obtained 8 days after fever onset shows progression of air space opacities to consolidation (black arrows) a follow-up chest radiograph obtained 9 days after fever onset shows progression of lung opacities to involve the middle and lower zones of bilateral lungs. for each patient, we retrospectively recorded the age, severity of fever (degree of elevated body temperature above 38\u00b0C or 100.4\u00b0F), leukocyte count, decreased percentage ( 20%) of lymphocytes in the leukocyte count, lymphopenia (absolute lymphocyte count 1,000/mm3), thrombocytopenia (platelet count seven of our 28 patients had associated comorbid diseases. these include hypertension, chronic lung disease, valvular heart disease and diabetes mellitus associated with hypothyroidism. three of 28 patients expired due to SARS. the maximum radiographic score also correlated with the severity of hypoxemia (p = 0.050) the mean radiographic score of the patients who died, patients with comorbidities and without comorbidity were 11.12 2.56 (mean SD) and 6.31 5.69 and 2.89 2.55, respectively (p = 0.032) the mean radiographic score of the patients who died, patients with comorbidities and without comorbidity were 11.12 2.56 (mean SD) and 6.31 the maximum radiographic score correlated best with the percentage of lymphocytes in the leukocyte count (p 0.001) the second most significant factor was the number of hospitalized days (p 0.001) and the third most significant factor was the absolute lymphocyte count (p = 0.13) leukocytosis were observed in 61% of our patients that was most prominent on day 20 after the onset of fever. leucopenia was found in 52% of cases that was most severe on day 10 of the illness. 91% of the patients had lymphopenia with the lowest lymphocyte count (mean: 347.97/mm3 247.28) at a mean time of 13.7 days. the relationship between lung change and blood gas found in this series is consistent with previous reports describing an inverse relationship between radiographic scores and the percentage of oxygen saturation. the maximum percentages of the involved lung in the mortality and survival groups were significantly different (41.5% 8.6 vs 16.4% 10.0, p 0.001) study only described the radiographic abnormalities in patients with SARS pneumonia. pathological changes were not elucidated by either histopathological studies or an animal model. the number of hospitalized days correlated most significantly with the mean radiographic score. leucopenia was found in 52% of cases that was most severe on day 10 of the illness. 91% of the patients had lymphopenia with the lowest lymphocyte count at a mean time of 13.7 days. thrombocytopenia was closely related to prognosis by multivariate analysis. the maximum percentages of the involved lung in the mortality and survival groups were significantly different (41.5% 8.6 vs 16.4% 10.0, p 0.001) (38). damage to those organs was associated with elevated enzymes by a frequency of 85% for AST, 74% for ALT, 43% for LDH, 13% for creatine kinase, and 95% for C-reactive protein. pathological changes were not elucidated by either histopathological studies or an animal model. the number of hospitalized days correlated most significantly with the mean radiographic score. the percentage of lymphocytes in a leukocyte count correlated best with the maximum radiographic score."}
