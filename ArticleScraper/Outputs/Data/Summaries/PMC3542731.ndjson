{"summary": "attenuated bacteria have been tested for the targeted delivery of heterologous antigens of bacterial, viral and parasitic origin into a variety of animal hosts. LAB and E. coli are a commensal and lactic acid bacteria are present in most fermented food items. salmonella is one genus that has been well examined as a vector. there exist several commercial vaccines that are used as anti-Salmonella vaccines in humans and animals. one genus which has been widely tested as vector is Listeria. Listeria can invade a variety of cells, including antigen presenting cells (APCs) it can escape the phagosome with the help of listeriolysin O (LLO; Hly) and reside in the cytoplasm of the cells, thereby efficiently presenting antigen to both CD8 and CD4 T cells. recombinant vaccines are based on both DNA viruses and RNA viruses. yFV (YF-17D strain) was the first to be licensed for use in humans. cDNAs encoding envelope proteins of YFV were replaced with genes of a Japanese encephalitis virus strain. the adenovirus vector is another of the most widely evaluated vectors to date. they have been extensively examined as a delivery vector in several preclinical and clinical studies for infectious diseases such as anthrax, hepatitis B, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1, influenza, measles, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) if a host has previously been infected there will exist robust B and T memory responses. this will theoretically reduce the exposure of the heterologous antigen to the immune system, as the vector is rapidly cleared. this could result in a reduction in the antigenicity of the vectored antigen. ous vaccine antigen was first raised in 1987. both serum and mucosal antibody responses against the foreign antigen were in fact upregulated in animals with prior exposure to the vector strain.

(2008) Mouse S. typhimurium S. typhimurium Fusion a vector suggested that there was no change in the T cell immune response against the heterologous antigen in pre-exposed individuals. the interleukin 4 (IL4) response was significantly higher when the animal host was exposed to the homologous strain, whereas pre-exposure to a related species did not have such an impact on IL4 responses. similar results were reported by Roberts et al. (1999) and Vindurampulle & Attridge (2003a, b). however, the latter authors found that the hypo-responsiveness could be eliminated by exposing animals to the foreign antigen prior to vector-priming. this would appear to be impractical for an immunization regimen! colleagues reported that pre-existing anti-vector immunity seriously compromises CD8+ responses in mice exposed to a similar strain used as vector. the difference between these two studies was that in the first, the prime and boost were with identical serovars, while in the second, different serovars were used. this may point to a way of avoiding downregulation of CD8 responses by pre-existing immunity by pre-existing immunity. vertical and horizontal transmission is associated with Salmonella in chickens. cross-protective cross-reactive immunity has been demonstrated against both homologous and heterologous challenges. pre-treatment of newly hatched chickens with different Salmonella strains could produce a complete invasion\u2013inhibition effect on any subsequent exposure to both homologous and heterologous strains. mouse HSV HSV Chicken ovabumin Lauterbach et al.

(2002) and Leong et al. (2009). only the study by Vijh et al. (1999) indicated that exposure to empty vector may completely abrogate immune responses against the delivered antigens. however, these studies also indicate that downregulation of antigen-specific immune responses is highly dependent on dose and time. the vaccines showed a lack of efficacy and tended to increase the risk of HIV-1 infection in vaccine recipients who had pre-existing neutralizing antibodies to AdHu5. however, pre-existing immunity to poliovirus has little effect on vaccine efficacy in a poliovirus-vectored vaccine. a common theme in these experimental approaches has been the limitations that pre-existing immunity to the vector may pose. some studies have reported on the influence of pre-existing immunity on humoral responses. boosting time and nature of the antigen used might be important. boosting at 7 weeks after pre-exposing animals to empty vector leads to lower antigen-specific IgG and secretory IgA responses. however, boosting at 14 weeks leads to higher IgG and secretory IgA responses. this is in conflict with the above result, although it should be mentioned that they used different Salmonella species. a large proportion of the population will have immunological memory against common serotypes. the presence of opsonizing antibodies should mean a higher level of bacterial uptake, leading to higher presentation to the immune system and therefore a better immune response. humoral immunity, especially for humoral immunity."}
