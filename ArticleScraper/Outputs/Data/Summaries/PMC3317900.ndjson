{"summary": "early diagnosis and prompt treatment are important in preventing disfiguring complications associated with late stages of the disease progression. presently there is no simple and rapid test that is appropriate for early diagnosis and use in low-resource settings where M. ulcerans is most prevalent. mycobacterium ulcerans (M. ulcerans) is a necrotizing skin disease endemic mostly in rural wetland of tropical countries of africa, America, Asia and Australia. the disease also occurs in non-tropical areas of Australia, China and Japan. BU has replaced leprosy as the second most prevalent mycobacterial disease [1], [3]\u2013[5]. IS2404 PCR has close to 96% sensitivity and is considered the method of choice for laboratory confirmation of BU [16]\u2013[25]. the WHO recommends that at least 50% of cases must be confirmed by IS2404 PCR before commencement of antibiotic therapy [22]\u2013[25]. pocket warmer LAMP (pwLAMP) technique offers high detection sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of BU. swabs were kept in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and swabs were stored dry in sterile tubes. each swab was transferred to separate new eppendorf tubes containing 250 l of lysis buffer. the mixtures were incubated horizontally in a shaker (200 rpm) overnight. 40 l of diatomaceous earth solution (10 g diatomaceous earth) was added to the suspensions. pellets were dried at 50\u00b0C for 20 min and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 sec. PCR for IS2404 targeting IS2404 was performed as described previously. first and second round PCRs used primers pGp1: 5\u2032-AGGGCAGCGCGGTGATACGG-3\u2032 and pGp2: 5\u2032- CAGTGGATTGGTGCCGATCGAG-3\u2032 and pGp2: 5\u2032-CAGTGGTGATACGG-3\u2032. PCR products were electrophoresed in agarose gel with ethidium bromide. size of amplicons was estimated by comparison with 100 bp plus DNA ladder. the reaction was terminated at 85\u00b0C for 5 min and the results were read by eye in ambient light and also using UV illumination. chi-squared test was performed to reveal the statistical difference using SPSS software. each swab was transferred into a tube containing 2 ml milli-Q purified water. the mixtures were incubated horizontally in a shaker at 60\u00b0C overnight. the mixtures were incubated horizontally in a shaker (200 rpm) to capture the DNA. Detection limit of LAMP Ten M. ulcerans strains grown on LJ slants were harvested. dilutions of purified DNA containing 300,000, 30,000, 300, 30 and 3 copies of IS2404 element per 5 l were prepared. the second round PCR products were electrophoresed in a 2% TAE (0.04 M Tris-acetate and 0.001 M EDTA pH 8.0) agarose gel with ethidium bromide. amplicons were estimated by comparison with 100 bp plus DNA ladder. reaction mixture contained 1.6 M of FIP and BIP, 0.2 M each of F3 and B3, 0.8 M each of LF and LB, 2 reaction mixture (12.5 l), 1 l of Bst DNA polymerase, 1 l of fluorescence detection reagent. reaction was terminated at 85\u00b0C for 5 min and results were read by eye in ambient light and also using UV illumination. 3 pocket warmers (of a pack of 30 hand warmers) tested in this study achieved a temperature of 60\u00b0C after 60 min. the pocket warmer provided a suitable temperature (60\u00b0C) and time range (60 min) for amplification. both pwLAMP and the conventional LAMP assays were able to detect to the limit of 300 copies of the target sequence after 60 min of amplification. the sensitivity and specificity of the LAMP assays for the detection of M. ulcerans is shown in tables 1 and 2. sensitivity and specificity of the LAMP assays for the detection of M. ulcerans is shown in tables 1 and 2. all negative specimens in IS2404 PCR were negative in both LAMP assays. the positivity of swabs was found to be in the range of 30% to 80% compared to 50% for fine needle aspirates. Detection limit of LAMP for M. ulcerans LAMP reaction requires a constant temperature of about 60\u00b0\u201365\u00b0C for 60 min for amplification of DNA [27]\u2013[34]. pwLAMP and the conventional LAMP assays were able to detect to the limit of 300 copies of the target sequence after 60 min of amplification. sensitivity and specificity of the LAMP assays for the detection of M. ulcerans is shown in tables 1 and 2. sensitivity and specificity of the LAMP assays for the detection of M. ulcerans is shown in tables 1 and 2. conventional LAMP Unboiled extract Boiled extract Purified extract (+) Total (+) Total (+) () Total IS2404 PCR (+) 12 9 21 9 12 21 21 0 21 IS2404 PCR (Loop mediated isothermal amplification) sensitivity of pwLAMP and PCR assays for the detection of M. ulcerans in clinical specimens is enhanced when purified DNA extracts are used. the method of choice for confirmation of BU diagnosis cannot be operational in BU endemic areas [16],[17],[24]\u2013[25]. pwLAMP, conventional LAMP and IS2404 PCR were able to detect 300 copies of IS2404 element (equivalent of 1.5 genomes of M. ulcerans) the detection limit of the conventional LAMP at 65\u00b0C improved to 30 copies of IS2404 and this level of sensitivity may be achieved with a pocket warmer that can attain a temperature of 65\u00b0C. however, 2 of the samples that were positive by IS2404 PCR were negative by the pw LAMP. potential boost to the application of pwLAMP in resource poor settings. development and testing in larger numbers of specimens is therefore necessary to access the potential use of pwLAMP as a simple and rapid point of care diagnostic test."}
