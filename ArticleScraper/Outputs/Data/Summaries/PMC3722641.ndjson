{"summary": "a new incidence peak was reached in 2012, with more than 2800 reported cases. these viruses are transmitted from small mammals to human beings. the disease begins with high fever and non-pathognomonic manifestations that can end in shock and organ failure. the most striking features of hantavirus disease are initially high fever and impaired renal function. hantavirus disease (along with norovirus and rotavirus disease, flu, and hepatitis C) is among the five most common notifiable viral diseases. clinical symptoms and parameters on which a suspected diagnosis of hantavirus disease may be based in Germany are summarized in Box 2. stage 1 High fever (3\u20134 days); non-specific \u201cflu-like\u201d symptoms such as headache, myalgia, chills, and conjunctivitis. severe, often colic-like flank pain, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting Stage 2 Hypotension; other hemostatic disorders; conjunctival bleeding and skin petechiae Stage 3 Ren hantavirus-induced cardiopulmonary syndrome (HFRS) is caused by hantaviruses circulating in America. hantavirus-induced cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) is caused by hypoxia and bilateral interstitial pulmonary infiltrates that start 2 days after disease onset. disease Virus species Genotype Reservoir host Distribution of the virus and of the disease Mortality (approx.) large majority of clinical cases are due to PUUV infection; in the north-eastern parts of the country, DOBV infections occur. hantavirus disease is marked by vasodilation and disturbances of the capillary endothelial barrier, resulting in extravasation of blood and inflammatory processes in the internal organs. the strength of the specific CD8-T-cell response and the synthesis of inflammatory cytokines appear to be correlated to the severity of disease. a number of different hantavirus species are in circulation in Germany. the one that most commonly causes disease in humans is the Puumala virus. the virus\u2019s natural host is the bank vole (Myodes glareolus), a cricetine rodent that is ubiquitous in Germany. the average number of reported cases each year is around 230. but much higher numbers were reported in 2007, 2010, and 2012. these hantavirus outbreaks affected in particular known endemic areas. cases of human infection have also been seen in cities in Cologne. a de novo hantavirus infection is given by parallel demonstration of IgM and IgG antibodies that react with hantavirus antigen. the hitherto inadequate state of knowledge about the occurrence of Tula virus infections could also be due to the antigenic relationship between Tula virus and Puumala virus. the viral strains from these areas each form their own sequence cluster in the molecular phylogenetic analysis. in each cluster the nucleotide sequences from patients and host animals are very closely related. it is also entirely possible to specify the origin of the individual virus strain more and more closely. the largest European study so far reported two pregnant women with acute Puumala virus infection and two others with acute Dobrava\u2013Belgrade virus infection. despite the fact that all four women became ill, in no case did the maternal infection lead to intrauterine damage or infection of the child. infection can be transmitted by rodents kept in the laboratory, such as brown rats, common voles and bank voles. this is only prescribed for brown rats by the Federation of European Laboratory Animal Science Associations. \"early warning system\"."}
