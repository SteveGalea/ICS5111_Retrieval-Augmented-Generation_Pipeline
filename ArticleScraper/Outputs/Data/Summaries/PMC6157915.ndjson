{"summary": "drugs with USD 1 billion or more of annual sales allow investments to be made in early-stage projects and smaller markets. the industry is also undergoing a transformation as traditional small molecule drugs are supplanted by next-generation protein-based biotechnology products manufactured from cell cultures. biomarkers are responsive to a broader agenda often referred to as the \u201cprecision medicine\u201d initiative. in some cases digital versions of these biomarkers have been identified. this will prompt and encourage the pharmaceutical industry to consider additional approaches and products. biomarker sensor is embedded device that monitors circulating glucose levels. it is invasive, and its embedded sensor is subject to interactions with the dermal and subcutaneous layers, collectively inducing what is referred to as a \u201cforeign body reaction,\u201d which includes an inflammatory response [14]. the emergence of wrist-based and handheld devices capable of recording and tracking biomarkers digitally has been dramatic. smartphones routinely possess basic step counters to allow owners to track physical activity, and a number of smart watches contain sophisticated sensors. a number of smart watches contain sophisticated sensors including photoplethysmograms and other circuitry to allow estimates of blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and body temperature. biomarkers could be captured digitally and longitudinally. if captured digitally and longitudinally, such outputs would constitute the \u201cdigital exhaust\u201d of a person, the \u201cdigital emissions\u201d providing information on the degree of wellness, a composite and wide-ranging equivalent of annual vehicle inspection and emission tests. the aircraft flight data recorder uses the knowledge gained to correct potential problems on other aircraft. the human analogy could involve phenotype-level alerts being issued to the medical community based on combinations of a deceased patient's genetics, lifestyle factors, and triggering events. a new generation of digitally savvy consumers is already using smartphones and computers to diagnose problems with their vehicles. the consumer seeks such vehicle data in a reactive manner, to diagnose a fault. this touches on a key consideration regarding the illness/wellness conundrum in healthcare. the pharmaceutical industry is ideally positioned to embrace a revamped pharmaceutical industry. this requires a rethinking of lifestyle management akin to life cycle management in the case of a vehicle. a purchaser of a vehicle will usually enjoy free service through at least the first 10,000 miles of its life. a new pharmaceutical industry model would offer a series of diagnostic tests (DX) in the form of both general and disease-specific screens. these would involve a combination of conventional liquid biopsy and digital monitoring biomarkers. some corporations have a portfolio of vaccines in their repertoire. data could be used to track wellness and provide information on relevant materials as a subject transitions through the juvenile and post\u00adpubescent stages. in the case of certain cardiovascular and neurological diseases, there is growing evidence that digital biomarkers can provide actionable diagnoses. the potential for reciprocal agreements between pharmaceutical companies could become a reality in this model. key drivers identified include increasing patient engagement, improving health outcomes measures, and the desire for deep data analytics [35]. a number of partnerships between pharmaceutical and health technology companies have recently been formed. a number of partnerships have recently been formed. the convergence of the pharmaceutical and digital technology sectors promises to have a defining impact on healthcare. however, numerous challenges will be experienced, not the least of which will be a clash of cultures between the two sectors. a major, perhaps defining issue is related to the actual data captured through these technologies. future leaders in the pharmaceutical sector will be those with access to large quantities of highly granular patient data. one such application is a joint program between IBM Watson and Pfizer on data analytics for immuno-oncology [39]. the impact of digital technologies on medicine seems certain to help evolve managed healthcare. an ultimate expression of a disease detection-intervention tool would be in the form of an integrated closed-loop disease management system. positioned sensors (DX) would track key biomarkers and communicate with a wireless hub. sensors able to detect such an event could trigger the release of a platelet-activating factor antagonist or anticoagulant. similar considerations apply to stroke and microstroke victims, and precision monitors could be engineered to pinpoint the onset of ischemic events. advances in our understanding of disease, coupled with new diagnostic technologies (both conventional and digital), have the potential for a revolutionary impact on patient care. a related set of technologies which focuses on health maintenance and wellness has also emerged, in some cases traversing the illness/wellness boundary. the need for this engagement is becoming acute, driven by both ethical and financial considerations. the focus on wellness is a central tenet for extending life expectancy, but considerations of later-stage quality of life have now become of heightened importance.
