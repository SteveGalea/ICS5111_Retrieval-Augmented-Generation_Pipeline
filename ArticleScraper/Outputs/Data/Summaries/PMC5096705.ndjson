{"summary": "EVs are small, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses with a genome of 7.5 kb, encapsidated into an icosahedral capsid, forming a non-enveloped virion of around 30 nm diameter. there are total 5 types of EV-D species: EV-D70, associated with acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis [2, 3], EV-D94, from mid-August 2014 to January 2015, 1,153 cases of respiratory illness caused by EV-D68 in 49 states and in the district of Columbia were reported. most cases were children, with a large percentage of them requiring pediatric intensive care, and some cases were fatal [25]. a cluster of cases with acute flaccid paralysis and cranial nerve dysfunction was also reported in 12 children. clade C is geographically restricted and circulated in many countries before the 2014 outbreak. subclades A1 and B2 are considered endemic and were found in many countries before the 2014 outbreak. the majority of EV-D68 strains circulating in the 2014 outbreak differ significantly from prior ones, mostly having three nucleotide variables. lectin-based staining showed that both 2,3-linked and 2,6-linked SA receptors are present in the cotton rat respiratory tract. 2,3-linked SA receptors were found on ciliated cells, whereas 2,3-linked SA receptors were more associated with mucin-producing cells in the cotton rat trachea. infection and immunization of cotton rats with live EV-D68 generated various levels of protection from virus challenge that correlated with the production of different levels of serum NA. we conclude that EV-D68 infection in cotton rats can provide novel insights that will enable the molecular dissection of immune responses to EV-D68. cotton rats were infected i.n. with 106 TCID50 per rat with 3 different strains of EV-D68, ATCC, VANBT and MO/49. evolutionary tree showing three major clades of EV-D68, A, B and C, distributed worldwide. we infected groups of 10 adult cotton rats i.n. with 106 TCID50 of each of the 3 strains of EV-D68. five animals per group were euthanized at 10 and 24 h post infection. groups of 4 animals were euthanized at 0.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 24, 48, and 96 h p.i. to measure the profile of virus replication in nose and lung tissues. infectious virus was almost undetectable at 48 h p.i. in the nose. in the lung, virus titers decreased to undetectable levels by 48 h. strands were detected in lungs of infected animals up to 48 h p.i. the levels of (-) vRNA in the lung briefly peaked at 4 h, maintained a brief plateau between 6\u201310 h, followed by a decrease and final clearance of viral intermediate by 96 h p.i. a set of animals infected with the different EV-D68 strains were followed 21 days after challenge. VANBT infection dramatically induced early production of the neutrophil chemoattractant chemokine GRO and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1), peaking within 4 h and sharply decreasing to basal levels by 10 h of infection. chemokines IP-10 and RANTES were induced with a more delayed kinetic, peaking within 10\u201324 h p.i. expression of the IFN-inducible genes, Mx-1 and Mx chemokines (GRO, MCP-1, IP-10 and RANTES), IFN-, two IFN-inducible genes (Mx-1 and Mx-2) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IFN-) in the lung tissues were measured by qRT-PCR. results are calculated as fold induction over uninfected (nave) animals. intramuscular immunization with EV-D68 strains enhances NA response. ibronchial inflammation (black arrow) and alveolitis (black arrow head) are indicated. images shown are representative of four cotton rats. i.m. immunization with UV-VANBT did not induce detectable NA titer. groups of cotton rats were mock-inoculated i.m. with 1x PBS or inoculated i.m. with live VANBT and sacrificed at 2, 5, and 15 h post inoculation. the following day, animals were challenged i.n. with 106 TCID50 of VANBT and euthanized 10 h later to determine nose and lung viral titers. n = 4\u20135 per group. * p0.05 for each group compared with mock group. ATCC immune sera generated measurable homologous NA titers against VANBT and MO/49. however, VANBT appeared to be the strongest inducing NA responses against all the three strains. all animals were immunized on day 0 and boosted at 3 weeks. i.m. immunization with live VANBT resulted in complete and rapid virus clearance in both nose and lung tissues. i.m. immunization with live VANBT resulted in complete and rapid virus clearance. animals mock-immunized i.m. (as primary infection), previously infected with VANBT i.n. (as secondary infection), or immunized i.m. with either UV-VANBT or live VANBT. immunization with live VANBT significantly reduced expression of IFN- and Mx-2 at 10 and 48 h p.i. animals previously infected with VANBT i.n. or immunized i.m. with UV-VANBT showed higher expression of IFN- compared to mock-immunized group. the magnitude of IFN- induction in live VANBT-immunized group was higher than these two groups. at either 10 or 48 h p.i. in the lung tissues were measured by qRT-PCR. results were calculated as fold-induction over uninfected animals. the Fermon strain is the oldest EV-D68 sequence in GenBank. it was collected in 1962 in California, USA. the tree is rooted by the oldest EV-D68 sequence in GenBank. group of 5 animals were euthanized at each time point. each bar corresponds to an individual animal. UN = uninfected. the amount of VANBT virus recovered was generally higher in the lung than in the nose at both 10 and 24 h p.i. the decrease in recovered infectious VANBT titer was around 1 log10 in both the tissues at 24 h p.i. virus titers remained constant between 0.5 to 10 h p.i. in the lung. in the lung, virus titers decreased to undetectable levels by 48 h. no infectious virus was detected in the lung and nose of animals inoculated with UV-VANBT. VANBT infection generated the highest NA titer (8 of 10 infected animals showed detectable homologous NA titers), MO/49 infection showed only one animal with detectable NA titer. ATCC infection resulted in no detectable NA response. VANBT infection in cotton rats induces pulmonary chemokine, IFN, and proinflammatory cytokine mRNA expression. cotton rats were infected with 106 TCID50 of VANBT or the same amount of UV-VANBT. VANBT infection in cotton rats causes lung pathology. n = 4\u20138, *p0.05 for VANBT compared to UV-VANBT at respective time point. intramuscular immunization with EV-D68 strains enhances NA response. no signs of clinical disease were seen in animals immunized i.m. with either inactivated or live viruses. serum samples from animals immunized with live ATCC showed the lowest NA titer (log2 8.70.5), followed by the group immunized with MO/49 (log2 12.70.5), while animals immunized with live VANBT showed the highest titer (log2 13.80.3) intramuscular immunization with live EV-D68 strains induces virus-specific homologous NA titers. female cotton rats were immunized i.m. with 106 TCID50/100 l of indicated virus on day 0 and boosted 3 weeks after the first immunization. aFemale cotton rats were immunized i.m. with 106 TCID50/100 l of indicated virus on day 0 and at 3 weeks. cGeomean SE of Log2 NA titers. Highlighted values represent homologous titers. dLimit of detection of the assay. all animals that received EV-D68 immunized showed a significant reduction in the nose and the lung viral titers by 1 Log10 at 10 h p.i. whereas animals that received UV-VANBT or MO/49 sera prophylactically showed no significant protection. intramuscular immunization with EV-D68 accelerates virus clearance. MO/49-immunized animals showed a moderate reduction in viral titer in nose and lung tissues by 0.7 Log10 and 1.7 Log10 respectively. intramuscular immunization with EV-D68 protects against VANBT challenge. immunization with live VANBT significantly reduced expression of IFN- and Mx-2 at 10 and 48 h p.i. in the immunized groups. animals previously infected with VANBT i.n. or immunized with UV-VANBT i.m. showed decreased expression of IFN-, but not of Mx2. intramuscular immunization with VANBT induces both Th1 and Th2 cytokines upon virus challenge. female cotton rats were mock-immunized i.m. on day 0 and at 3 weeks with UV-VANBT. at 7 weeks, all animals were challenged i.n. with 106 TCID50/100 l of virus. Graphs represent the average scores for bronchiolitis, vasculitis, interstitial pneumonia, and alveolitis. results are representative of two independent experiments, n = 5. p0.05 for each group compared with mock immunized group. the cotton rat is a preferred model for an impressive list of human pathogens. the species of the cotton rat (genus Sigmodon) has been shown to be a preferred model for an impressive list of human pathogens. EV-A71 strain isolated from samples of the brain and feces of children during an outbreak in Bulgaria in 1975 induced a paralytic disease in newborn and adult cotton rats [51]. we recently showed that cotton rats are permissive to infection with HRVs, and i.n. infection resulted in recovery of infectious viral load in the lung until 2 days p.i. accompanied by significant pathology, mucus production, and expression of inflammatory mediators. viral replication intermediate, (-) vRNA, showed peak expression prior to detection of peak infectious virus titer. it confirms that we are detecting early products of viral replication, which eventually increased the viral titer at 10 h p.i. the 2014 USA outbreak of acute flaccid paralysis occurred at the same time as a far larger outbreak of EV-D68 across the USA. rats by fully functional Mx genes may underlie the short-lived replication cycle of VANBT in cotton rats. however, it has been suggested that healthy adults usually show a milder range of respiratory symptoms upon EV-D68 infection. EV-D68 infection was reported in adult patients with hematologic malignancy and hematopoietic cell transplant recipients. a recent study has estimated that genetic diversity in the VP1 region increased after the late 1990s, which may have resulted in the emergence of the three clades. this suggests that ATCC could differ vastly in terms of its antigenic characteristics, and even replication in humans, and as shown here, in cotton rats. i.m. immunization with live VANBT and MO/49 resulted in a decrease of viral loads in nose and lung tissues. i.n. infection with VANBT resulted in induction of NA titer. animals previously infected with VANBT did not show any significant protection. live i.m. VANBT-immunized animals mount both strong Th1 and Th2 responses. UV-inactivated viruses used for immunization have the propensity to develop Th2-biased responses and enhanced respiratory disease. a live EV-D68 vaccine generates high titer NA and could be useful to define mechanisms of immunity against the virus. we used EV-D68 clinical isolates from human patients without any adaptation to infect cotton rats. this is one of the biggest advantages of our model because it is clear that virus adaptation introduces a considerable number of nucleotide variations in viral genome. the strains detected in recent years have similar VP1 sequences as long as they belong to the same genetic clade. rats were infected i.n. or immunized intramuscularly (i.m.) with three different strains of EV-D68. rats were fed a diet of standard rodent chow and water ad libitum. euthanized by carbon dioxide asphyxiation. d vigorously to release the cell associated viruses and centrifuged at 800 x g before determination of TCID50/g of tissue. cDNA was prepared from 1 g of initial RNA and diluted to 100 l of the final volume. cDNA for the negative strand viral RNA was synthesized by priming with a forward primer flanking at the start of the VP1 sequence. the entire VP1 PCR amplicon was gel purified and diluted to generate a copy number standard curve. the assessment of cotton rat cytokines mRNA expression was carried out using primers as previously described. cytokine genes and total vRNA or (-) vRNA were calculated as geometric means standard error (SE) for all animals in a group at a given time p.i. student t-test was used to determine statistically significant differences between two groups. serum samples were obtained by retro-orbital blood collection. animals were euthanized by carbon dioxide asphyxiation. Viruses Three strains of EV-D68 were studied. in 96 well plates were washed with serum free medium and infected with serial 10-fold diluted tissue homogenates. each assay was repeated at least three times with three to five replicates per assay. each assay was repeated at least three times with four replicates per assay. the assessment of cotton rat cytokines mRNA expression was carried out using primers as previously described. lungs were embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained using hematoxylin and eosin. slides were scored blindly on a 0 to 4-severity scale. group of 4 cotton rats were infected i.n. with 106 TCID50 of VANBT. vRNA was quantified by qRT-PCR in lung tissue. animals inoculated with UV-VANBT and sacrificed at 6 h p.i. were shown as control.
