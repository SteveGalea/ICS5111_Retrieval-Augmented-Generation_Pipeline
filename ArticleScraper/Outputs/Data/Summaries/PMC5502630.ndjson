{"summary": "MHV causes mild encephalitis with immune-mediated demyelination. absence of DP1 expression increased mortality from 10 to 80%. the virus is detected only in the brain in MHV-infected mice (20) survival decreased from 70% in WT mice to 0% in DP1/ mice. no differences in virus titers in the liver or in inflammation as assessed by proinflammatory cytokine expression. MHV titers in the brains of MHV-infected B6 or DP1/ mice were measured at 5 dpi. data represent the mean SEM of two independent experiments. brains from MHV-infected mice were harvested at 8 dpi for quantifying T-cell responses. brain cells were incubated with M133 peptide in the presence of Brefeldin A for 6 h. frequency and number of IFN + cells (Left and Center) and frequency of TNF+IFN + cells (Right) are shown. FN- levels at 3 dpi, we sorted brain hematopoietic (CD45+) and nonhematopoietic (CD45) cells from virus-infected mice. differences in IFN- mRNA were confined almost entirely to microglia. differences in IFN-I and IFN-III expression in microglia. WT or DP1/ mice were infected i.c. with MHV. brains were harvested at indicated time points post infection for qRT-PCR (A\u2013D and F) and lipid analysis (E) the activation status of microglia and macrophages is shown as the MFI (mean fluorescence intensity) of CD69 (B), F4/80 (C), CD40 (D), and CD86 (E). the frequency and number of neutrophils. functionality of microglia and macrophages are depicted as frequency (A) and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) (B) of TNF+ cells. data represent the mean SEM of two independent experiments; n = 4 mice per group. infiltrating hematopoietic cells was not able to compensate for lack of DP1 signaling in microglia and macrophages. to understand the global effects of DP1 signaling better, we performed genome-wide expression analysis using sorted brain CD11b+ cells from WT and DP1/ mice at 3 dpi. most of these genes either were not annotated or did not fall into specific pathways. microarray analyses of CD11b cells at 3 dpi. DP1/ or WT mice were infected with MHV. at 3 dpi CD11b+ cells from the brain were sorted using magnetic beads. activated caspase 1 levels were elevated in total CD11b+ cells and microglia from DP1/ mice compared with those in total CD11b+ cells and microglia from WT mice. increased inflammasome activity in the absence of DP1 signaling. data represent the mean SEM of two independent experiments. n = 4 samples per group; *P 0.05, **P 0.01, two-way ANOVA. in accordance with direct ex vivo analyses, levels of secreted IL-1 were significantly greater in DP1/ BMMs than in WT BMMs at both 12 and 24 h post infection (hpi) we also measured levels of a related protein, IL-1, which is not inflammasome dependent. treatment with anakinra improved survival of MHV-infected DP1/ mice. treatment with an IL-1 receptor antagonist (i.e., anakinra) improved survival. in the up-regulation of Pydc3 mRNA expression in uninfected DP1/ BMMs. we treated WT or IFN- receptor double-negative (IFNAR) BMMs with either agent resulted in increased PYDC3 expression in WT. however, contrary to this prediction, IFN- was not up-regulated in uninfected cells following BW245C treatment. WT or DP1/ BMMs were treated with BW245C (C and F), forskolin (D and F) and Pydc3 mRNA levels were quantified using qRT-PCR. IL1 in cell supernatants was quantified by ELISA. the human protein POP3 (Pyrin only protein 3) is not encoded in the human genome. however, the human protein POP3 (Pyrin only protein 3) may be its functional analog. to assess the clinical relevance of PGD2 up-regulation of PYDC3, we determined whether treatment with BW245C or forskolin up-regulated the expression of POP3 in human macrophages. the absence of DP1 expression increased mortality from 10 to 80%, with concomitant weight loss. the virus is detected only in the brain in MHV-infected WT mice (20), but the increased lethality in DP1/ mice was consistent with the notion that virus spread extraneurally in these mice. 59 is also hepatotropic, but we observed no differences in virus titers in the liver or in inflammation as assessed by proinflammatory cytokine expression. results indicate that DP1 signaling was protective in infected DP1/ mice. increased morbidity and mortality in infected DP1/ mice. the absence of DP1 signaling and increased mortality were associated with changes in virus load. we measured MHV titers in the brain at 3\u20139 dpi. DP1 signaling was required for initial control of the infection. the frequency and number of IFN + cells (Left and Center) and the frequency of TNF+IFN + cells (Right) are shown. the frequency (Left) and total number (Right) of virus-specific CD8 T cells, determined using MHC class I/peptide S510 tetramers are shown. IFN- mRNA was expressed at much lower levels in CD45+ cells. differences in IFN- mRNA were confined almost entirely to microglia. differences in IFN-I and IFN-III expression in microglia. Ifn mRNA expression on days 3, 6, and 9 post infection in total brain (A) and in CD45 and CD45+ cells (B, Left) and microglia (CD45intCD11b+) and macrophages (CD45hiCD11b+) (B, Right) in WT and DP1/ mice at 3 dpi. n = 4 mice per group; *P 0.05; **P 0.01; ***P 0.001, Mann\u2013Whitney U test. microglia and macrophages were less activated in the absence of DP1 signaling. functionality of microglia and macrophages depicted as frequency (A) and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of TNF+ cells. data represent mean SEM of two independent experiments; n = 4 mice per group. total CD11b+ cells (comprising microglia and macrophages) were used to obtain adequate amounts of RNA. 169 genes were differentially regulated in naive WT and DP1/ CD11b cells. i. DP1/ or WT mice were infected with MHV, and at 3 dpi CD11b+ cells from the brain were sorted using magnetic beads for microarray analysis. the heat map shows the percentage of differentially expressed genes with various immune-related functions. brain-derived cells from MHV-infected WT or DP1/ mice (A\u2013C) or BMMs infected with A59 in vitro (D\u2013G) were analyzed for IL1 (A, B, D, and G), caspase-1 (C and E), or cAMP (F) BMMs were generated from WT, NLRP3/, ASC/, or caspase-1/ bone marrow. cells were assayed for IL-1 by ELISA at 24 hpi. data represent mean SEM of two independent experiments. we measured levels of a related protein, IL-1, which is not inflammasome dependent. we also measured levels of a related protein, IL-1, which is not inflammasome dependent. cAMP directly inhibits inflammasome activation, so its absence likely contributes to the increased IL-1 production in DP1/ mice. treatment with anakinra improved survival of MHV-infected DP1/ mice from 10 to 70%. treatment with IFN-induced Pydc3 expression in both WT and DP1/ BMMs. DP1 signals through cAMP but not in DP1/ BMMs. treatment with either agent resulted in increased PYDC3 expression in WT but not in ifnar/ cells. however, contrary to this prediction, IFN- was not up-regulated in uninfected cells following BW245C treatment. BMMs were infected with A59 following either siRNA-mediated knockdown in WT BMMs (G) or overexpression of Pydc3 in DP1/ BMMs (H) mRNA levels were quantified using qRT-PCR. IL1 in cell supernatants was quantified by ELISA. GD2/DP1 signaling in upregulation of human POP3 is not encoded in the human genome. however, the human protein POP3 (Pyrin only protein 3) may be its functional analog. treatment with BW245C or forskolin up-regulated expression of POP3 in human macrophages (MDMs) differences in PYDC3 expression and inflammasome activation were detected to a greater extent in microglia than in infiltrating macrophages. bone marrow chimera experiments demonstrated that DP1 signaling in nonhematopoietic cells was critical for mouse survival after MHV infection. POP3 has extensive (60%) sequence identity with the PYD of the DNA sensor molecule AIM2. NLRP3 was not required for inflammasome activation in infected cells. other members of the NLRP family contain PYDs. mortality in DP1/ mice was mediated in large part by high levels of IL-1. survival was still only 60\u201370%, suggesting other consequences of excessive inflammasome activation may contribute to disease severity. reduced levels of IFN-I and IFN-III mRNA in DP1/ microglia also may have contributed to delayed virus clearance and poor clinical outcomes. inflammasomes can up-regulate eicosanoid expression, resulting in a hyperinflammatory state with high mortality (2). inflammasomes can up-regulate eicosanoid expression, resulting in a hyperinflammatory state with high mortality (2). eicosanoids may regulate inflammasome activation, but the relationship is complex. mice were lightly anesthetized by administering avertin (300 L) i.p. for infections, mice were lightly anesthetized by administering avertin (300 L) i.p. and were infected intracranially (i.c.) with 700 or 3,000 pfu of the JHM strain of MHV or the A59 strain of MHV. microglia and macrophages were gated as CD45intCD11b+ and CD45hiCD11b+. antibodies and Flow Cytometry were used. 1 106 cells were blocked with 1 g of anti-CD16/32 antibody. cells were incubated with anti-IFN-, anti-TNF, or anti-IL1 antibody. to measure caspase-1 activation, cells were stained with tetramer. cells were permeabilized using a Foxp3 staining kit (BD Biosciences) to 23 L of PCR mixture containing 2 SYBR Green Master Mix (ABI) and 0.2 M of forward and reverse primers. cycle threshold values were normalized to those of the housekeeping gene hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) RNA was purified using a mirVana kit (Life Technologies) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions.
