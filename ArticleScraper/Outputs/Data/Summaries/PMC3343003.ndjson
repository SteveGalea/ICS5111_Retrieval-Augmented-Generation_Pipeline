{"summary": "new treatment regimens for non-transplanted patients with hematological malignancies have had potential to increase the incidence of viral infections in this group. this study prospectively investigated the prevalence of a broad range of respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) as well as viruses that commonly reactivate after allogeneic HSCT. reactivation of cytomegalovirus (CMV) is reported in neutropenic hematological neutropenic patients with fever. bacterial infection is documented in only about one-third or fewer of febrile episodes [11]\u2013[14]. qPCR for parvovirus B19 (B19) was performed on an ABI 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) and carried out in a total of 50-l. new primers and probes are described in Table 1. for human rhinovirus (HRV) [17], human enterovirus [18], influenza A virus (IFA) [19], influenza B virus (IFB) [20], respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [21], and parainfluenza virus type 1 (PIV1) [22], the design is described elsewhere.

PCR was the commonest finding in our study which could be explained by the use of PCR instead of culture. not all viral respiratory tract infections cause fever, and different virus types are known to be variously pyrogenic. bacterial culture is limited in sensitivity, but it is of interest to note that virus existed more often as the sole pathogen identified here than as a cofactor with bacteria. both respiratory virus infections and low titers of viruses in blood from patients with neutropenia were common. viral findings in NPA were associated to URTS indicating active infection."}
