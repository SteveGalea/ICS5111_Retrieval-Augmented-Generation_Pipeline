{"summary": "influenza is an important burden on human health and a challenge for health services, making it a priority for surveillance activities. objectives of influenza surveillance include monitoring annual epidemics and detecting and characterising circulating viruses. a wide variety of statistical methods are available for defining influenza epidemics, detecting influenza outbreaks, and to assess the intensity of epidemics. some important issues remain unresolved such as the evaluation of the validity of a given method in the absence of a gold standard. a modified version of this approach named MEM is being implemented by the world health organisation and the European Centres for Disease Prevention and Control. the method is to define the baseline influenza activity in historical data and to establish an epidemic threshold above which the weekly rates are considered to be in the epidemic period. the moving epidemic method is to model influenza epidemics based on historical data from a specific country or region. the method has three main steps: first, the length, start and the end of the annual epidemics are determined. the postepidemic baseline is the mean of all preepidemic rates. for each season, the highest n values from the preepidemic period are taken. t (i),j is the ith preepidemic highest rate. Romania provided both ILI and ARI data independently. four countries provided data from nationwide or a combination of notification systems. the MAP curve draws the maximum cumulated rate for a period of a given length r, expressed as percentage of the total rate of the jth season. t i,j is the ith rate of the jth season, N is the number of seasons, and S is the number of surveillance weeks per season. when this increment is lower than the predefined criteria, the optimum is found. a postepidemic threshold is calculated using the n highest values of each epidemic period to build a sample of n N rates. the geometric mean and 50%, 90% and 95% onesided confidence intervals are calculated. lag is zero if there is no delay between the start of the epidemic period modelled by MEM for the 2009\u20132010 season and the alert week. crossvalidation analysis The accuracy of the method was evaluated using a crossvalidation procedure. the number of nonepidemic weeks below the threshold divided by the number of weeks below the threshold. a crossvalidation procedure was used to assess the quality of the method. negative predictive value (PPV): the number of nonepidemic weeks below the threshold divided by the number of weeks below the threshold. the number of nonepidemic weeks below the threshold divided by the number of weeks below the threshold. preepidemic thresholds per 100 000 population ranged from 25 (Ireland and Portugal) to 168 (Romania) for ILI data. from 189 (Kazakhstan) to 762 (Romania) for ARI data. most of the countries with a variation in a range of 10% were different to preepidemics thresholds, with the exception of Castilla y Le\u00f3n (Spain), Hungary and Poland in which these differences were much higher. the modelling results for the 2009\u20132010 epidemic, summarised in Table 2, are also plotted by the countries. EM identified an epidemic period of 12 weeks and a preepidemic threshold of 71 cases per 100 000 population. the alert week in week 38 was the first week of the epidemic period detected by MEM. there was no detection lag, and no false alerts were observed prior to that week. intensity of the epidemic was moderated, peaking very much below the 90% level of historical epidemic values. the false alerts and timeliness results appeared quite similar to the ILI countries. in Albania, epidemic was detected 2 weeks after the start of the epidemic period, producing a detection lag according to the model. data 718 955 913 886 1 Influenzalike Illness data 757 960 924 904 1 Belgium 946 987 973 973 0 Castilla y Leon 773 984 964 915 0 Greece 855 936 906 952 05 Hungary 768 935 929 887 1 Ireland 554 961 939 838 2 Israel 726 964 939 881 1 Kyrgyzstan 800 920 815 881 1 Norway 596 914 the specificity of the alert signal was 955%. the specificity was similar for both types of data. no significant differences were found (P = 020) used in each country varied from five in Kyrgyzstan (ILI), Romania (ILI and ARI) and Kazakhstan (ARI) to 15 in the Netherlands.

ARI data show more differences between pre and postepidemic baselines than ILI data. despite the differences between ILI and ARI, the only statistic that we observed to be significantly different between ILI and ARI systems is positive predictive value. changes in case reporting, demographics, case definitions and secular trends 39 could affect how well the model fits the tested data. the main achievement of the MEM is an algorithm splitting one wave season in three periods using preepidemic information to calculate a threshold. intensity calculated by MEM with a standard algorithm would allow international assessment of clinical influenza activity among European countries. authors would like to thank all investigators, the secretaries and the staff from the WHO Regional Office for Europe, the European Centre for Diseases Prevention and Control and country representatives. the state Sanitary Epidemiological surveillance committee (Bishkek): Dr. Temirgalieva Aigul; and the Department of Epidemiological Surveillance Republic SES of Kazahstan: Dr. Ainagul Kuatbaeva.
