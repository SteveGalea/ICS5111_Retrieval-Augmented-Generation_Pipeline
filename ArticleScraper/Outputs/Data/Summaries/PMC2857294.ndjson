{"summary": "survey of risk perception, knowledge, and sources of information for a hypothetical influenza pandemic in 5 European countries (Denmark, Spain, Great Britain, the Netherlands, and Poland) participants were asked to rate how serious they thought it would be to contract a range of illnesses including a heart attack, common cold, a new strain of influenza, and the like. respondents were given a list of 6 places and asked in which of these they thought they would run the greatest risk for infection. they were then randomly given 1 of 2 scenarios: a high-risk scenario in which 10% of their fellow inhabitants of all ages would be seriously ill with influenza and 0.1% would have died. probit regression was used to assess the effect of individual- and regional-level covariates on each reported precautionary action. the main outcome variable was whether respondents reported that they would avoid the places presented to them. for 8 different specifications, the explanatory variables remain the same. questionnaire was based on a SARS and influenza risk perception questionnaire (14) the questionnaire was translated into local languages and back translated to check the accuracy of these translations. respondents were asked to rate how serious they thought it would be to contract a range of illnesses. respondents asked in which of these they thought they would run the greatest risk for infection. they were randomly given 1 of 2 scenarios: a high-risk scenario in which 10% of their fellow inhabitants of all ages would be seriously ill with influenza. a low-risk scenario in which these rates were 2.5% and 0.025% respectively. regression was used to assess the effect of individual- and regional-level covariates on each reported precautionary action. for 8 different specifications, the explanatory variables remain the same. only the outcome of interest (the probability of taking the preventive action) varied. the number of respondents in each participating region ranged from 401 to 502 (Table 2). compared with Asians, relatively more Europeans had a secondary education, fewer had a university education and substantially fewer lived in urban areas. region NA NA High-risk scenario 1 if given outbreak scenario is high risk 0.50 (0.50) 0.66 (0.47) Health status on 1\u20136 Likert scale 4.28 (1.10) 4.25 (1.08) Employed 1 if employed 0.60 (0.49) 0.22 (0.49) *NA, not available.

Asian respondents reported that they were less likely to avoid restaurants and other entertainment establishments and more likely to avoid visiting physicians. the participation rate varied 21%\u201381% among regions. a low response brings into question the representativeness of the samples. the similarity in findings between regions suggests that the low participation rate did not bias the findings."}
