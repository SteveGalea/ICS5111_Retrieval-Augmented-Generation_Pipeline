{"summary": "TB infection is a clinical state in which the child exhibits no symptoms or signs of disease, but, if tested, would have evidence of immunological sensitization to mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) of these one million children, modeling studies suggest that 250,000 children die each year (3). the typical adult-type disease begins to manifest, with apical cavities and parenchymal breakdown, reflecting pathology largely caused by the host immune response. societal and behavioral elements may influence these age-related changes in risk of disease progression and resulting disease phenotype. in this article we aim to bring together all the available evidence into one review. where evidence is available, we have focused on evidence from co-infection with TB in children. we present data on co-infection in adults, recognizing this is imperfect, but preferable to excluding those co-infections. host immune response to M. tuberculosis involves both the innate and adaptive immune system. bacilli are inhaled into the terminal alveoli where they are readily phagocytosed by resident alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells. this process results in activation of antimicrobial mechanisms, which serve to limit the growth of M. tuberculosis and recruit additional immune cells. excessive TNF- promotes immunopathology by interfering with cell death processes and induction of a hyper-inflammatory milieu. a neutrophil-driven, IFN-inducible transcript signature in adult whole blood was recently identified that correlated with clinical severity. neutrophilia has been associated with poorer prognosis. the immune mechanisms involved in these processes are poorly defined. co-infections play a role in disrupting this balance. this balance can be influenced by several factors. both CMV and TB induce Type I IFN signature EBV CD8+ T cell response predominates, strong type I IFN response Unknown in humans Herpes virus latency in mice protective against bacterial infection due to persistent IFN signature Hepatitis B and C Hep B\u2014CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. chronic infection with either Hepatitis B or C is associated with higher regulatory T cells and IL10, lower IFN, IFN which may increase susceptibility to TB primary infection may result in immunosuppression, while secondary infection may result in T cell activation (as measured by HLA-DR), both associated with increased risk of TB disease progression Respiratory viruses Influenza\u2014induces type I IFN signaling pathway Downregulates TLR stimulation, decreased neutrophil recruitment. concurrent infection seen Helminths IgE, IgG4, Th2 cytokines (IL4, IL9, IL13), Regulatory T cells and cytokines (TGF, IL10) Shift away from Th1 likely to contribute to immune susceptibility and progression to disease. malarial parasites decrease the humoral and cellular response to TB. children diagnosed with TB should be screened for TB and conversely, children newly diagnosed with TB should be screened for TB (22). combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) can restore immune function and reduce morbidity and mortality among HIV-infected children. it takes 2 years for the full potential of protection against TB to be realized. IL-10, produced by macrophages and regulatory T cells, also decreases apoptosis. plasma IL-10 levels are higher in TB-HIV co-infected adults with pulmonary disease compared to those with HIV and TB infection alone. EBV, cytomegalovirus (CMV), varicella zoster virus (VZV) and the human herpes viruses (HHV)6-8 have sophisticated mechanisms for evading the host immune system. CMV infection of the mother during pregnancy can be associated with congenital infection of the fetus, leading to fetal loss and, in surviving infants, neurodevelopmental delay. children with asymptomatic CMV infection have been shown to have markedly fewer CMV-specific CD4+ T cells that produced IFN- compared to adults with asymptomatic CMV infection, an effect that lasted for over a year (42). compared to adults with asymptomatic CMV infection, a response demonstrated to be associated with TB disease (44). most children are infected with HHV6 by the time they are 2 years of age. positive HHV7 serology is almost universal by adulthood (54) and HHV8 is common in low resource settings. the herpes viruses have a marked effect on the host immune system. in highly endemic areas, HBV is acquired perinatally through vertical transmission from the mother to neonate, or during early childhood. the outcome of acute HBV infection is largely age-dependent. 80\u201390% of infants and 30\u201350% of children aged 1\u20136 years old developing chronic infection, compared to just 5% of adults. 1% of the global population (71 million) is HCV-infected with an estimated 1.75 million new infections occurring in 2015. mother-to-child transmission occurs in 6% of HCV-affected pregnancies. up to 80% of pediatric cases of chronic infection (70) the global burden of measles remains high with an estimated 7 million cases and 89,780 measles-related deaths in 2016. measles is most common in poorly nourished young children, particularly those with immunosuppression, or vitamin A deficiency (77). in vivo, expression of IFN-stimulated genes is not increased in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of children with measles. CD8+ T cells are important for viraemic clearance which occurs within a few days of the onset of the rash (90). circulating activated CD8+ T cells and plasma levels of IFN- fall rapidly. the clinical effect of measles co-infection on TB has been studied since the early 20th century. measles co-infection has a deleterious effect on TB containment in children and adults. in the 1960s, increased TB relapses in those with wild measles compared to those with vaccine measles. human adenoviruses are a common cause of childhood infections worldwide. their ability to infect many cell types makes them useful vectors for gene delivery (109) and their immunogenic properties mean they are also used as vaccine vectors (110). an estimated 90 million new cases of influenza and 20 million cases of influenza-associated acute LRTI in children 5 years old each year. of the estimated annual 28,000-111,500 pediatric deaths attributable to influenza LRTIs, 99% occur in developing countries (122) studies of previous influenza pandemics suggest an interaction between influenza and TB. authors speculate that young children living with adults with infectious pulmonary TB could be at enhanced risk of TB exposure. this immunomodulation could precipitate reactivation of TB infection (130) but results from a single study comparing anti-influenza antibody titres in adults without and without pulmonary TB were inconclusive. an estimated 90 million new cases of influenza and 20 million cases of influenza-associated acute LRTI in children 5 years old each year. the global burden of influenza disease in young children is high, with an estimated 90 million new cases of influenza and 20 million cases of influenza-associated acute LRTI each year. a seasonal pattern of influenza activity is followed by a peak in pulmonary TB cases 2\u20133 months later and IPD 3 months later. this window between influenza and TB peaks corresponds to the time it takes for a young TB-exposed child to develop primary TB. young children living with adults with infectious pulmonary TB could be at enhanced risk of TB exposure. non-influenza respiratory viruses account for an even greater burden of morbidity and mortality in children than influenza. an estimated 33 million new episodes of acute LRTI per year in children age 5 years and under, 3.2 million of which necessitate hospital admission. several studies report on pneumonia and TB in children. TB was diagnosed in 1.8\u201323% of cases and HIV co-infection was common. autopsy studies suggest bacterial co-infections are important causes of death in children with TB. respiratory bacteria were less frequently detected in nasopharyngeal swabs of TB patients compared to controls. TB disease severity was higher only in those in whom both viruses and bacteria were detected. bacterial bloodstream infection (particularly salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, Staphylcoccus aureus, and enterobacteriaceae) have also been reported as a common cause of febrile illness in children. inia spp, Listeria monocytogenes, and listeria monocytogenes found fewer Chlamydia trachomatis infections observed within the first year post-TB diagnosis compared to the non-TB population. all 8 patients with salmonella and TB were also HIV co-infected (158). besides ICBI, multiple other bacteria have been reported to be associated with TB, including S. aureus, Streptococcus milleri, there exists an inverse correlation between cystic fibrosis carriership and TB incidence, suggesting a lower susceptibility of cystic fibrosis carriers to TB. the relationship is complex and unproven; both blocking and masking mechanisms have been proposed. the epidemiology of NTM varies by world region (166) a previous history of TB disease is a risk factor for NTM pulmonary disease. bronchiectasis is often seen in children with HIV and chronic lung disease, (178) past TB, recurrent pneumonia, severe immunosuppression, and lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis. mycobacteria and fungi are both \u201cpoor agonists\u201d of the TLRs. virulent strains of both mycobacteria and fungi appear to induce a Th2 rather than a Th1 response. granuloma are also noted in fungal, but not other bacterial infections. chronic pulmonary aspergillosis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. the most common predisposing factor is previously-treated TB. the most common predisposing factor is previously-treated TB, independent of HIV infection (189). the microbiome can prime the adaptive immune system, particularly in its mucosal T-cell response. there is increasing interest in the role of the microbiome in TB pathogenesis. a comprehensive review of the microbiome and potential TB risk is beyond the scope of this article. infants experience infections with rotavirus, cryptosporidium, E. coli, Shigella and adenovirus most commonly. infants experience infections with rotavirus, cryptosporidium, E. coli, Shigella and adenovirus. this shift away from Th1 responses is responsible for making individuals infected with helminths more susceptible to TB infection and disease. there is variability in studies of the influence of helminth infection on diagnostic tests for TB infection, mostly focusing on the TST. T-cell functional studies showed suppressed IFN- responses to whole blood stimulation with BCG and Plasmodium falciparum. children with ascaris or schistosomiasis infections showed significantly increased Th2 responses to mycobacterial stimulation. however, no longitudinal studies have been powered to determine whether helminth infection influences progression from TB infection to disease. an Indian study of more than 5000 patients over 10 years showed no effect of helminth co-infection on progression to disease nor severity of disease in an adult population. the burden of helminthic infection peaks by adolescence, suggesting at least partial protective immunity with increasing age. co-infections have been studied in both animal models and humans. in humans, co-infection with malaria and TB seems to modulate the immune response to confer immunological protection against malaria while weakening response to TB. animal models suggest that M. tuberculosis offers some non-specific protection against rodent plasmodium. both diseases seem to share common pathogenesis pathways and genetic factors affecting susceptibility. multiple other protozoa, including leishmania, trichomona, toxoplasma, giardia and entamoeba, have been described in co-infection with TB. the literature is limited to several case reports, few epidemiological surveys and some immunological research. gulate the IL-12 receptor expression after stimulation of the triple infection (245) it has been suggested that TB could be a decisive contributing factor to the high mortality observed in patients with visceral leishmaniasis and HIV. the true prevalence and impact of co-infection remain unclear. antigen specific induction of T and B lymphocytes and the \u201cadaptive\u201d immune system have traditionally been ascribed the role of vaccine-induced protection. but cells in the innate immune system appear to be influenced by contact with a variety of antigens. the duration and mechanisms by which this long-term innate immunity is induced are the subject of extensive research. s induce antibodies mediated protection against TB, but this has not been explored. a relationship between TB and other infections has been explored. the relationship between TB and other infections has been explored. a more comprehensive understanding of the effect of co-infections on the diagnosis and treatment of children with TB would help manage children with both illnesses. a more comprehensive understanding of the effect of co-infections on the diagnosis and treatment of children with TB would help manage children with both illnesses. udinal cohorts Describe the natural history of TB exposure in children following a variety of different exposures/interventions Mother -infant and birth cohort studies. these infants will be having samples taken to explore the impact of maternal immunization on their vaccine responses. these studies would also collect samples for serological analyses, transcriptomics, presence of pathogen particles in blood (antigen/PCR), and culture samples from blood or other sites. co-infections are common in children in low resource settings. co-infections may affect host response to M. tuberculosis. Vaccinations are also important, both for direct protection from the pathogens vaccines."}
