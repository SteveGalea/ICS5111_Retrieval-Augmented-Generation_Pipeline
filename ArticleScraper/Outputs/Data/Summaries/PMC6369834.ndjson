{"summary": "Investing in neighboring countries' epidemiological and laboratory capacities is key for the security of both EU citizens and their neighbors. strong capacity of public health microbiology laboratory systems is crucial in providing timely and reliable information on pathogen detection and characterization needed for effective infectious diseases prevention and control. the transformation process will be reinforced in socio-economic development. despite positive achievements in national microbiology laboratory service capabilities, there is an urgent need for these countries to further improve their public health microbiology systems before they join the EU. establishing the Observer role to NMFP facilitated national efforts to improve antimicrobial resistance surveillance. a majority of countries reported that being part of the ECDC microbiology expert network helped them prepare for implementation of EUCAST clinical breakpoints for standardized antimicrobial susceptibility testing. this role also facilitated participation in WHO/Europe coordinated central Asian and Eastern European Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (CAESAR) network (5). delegates discussed the feasibility of sharing expertise across countries and possible mechanisms to enable certain laboratories to serve as reference laboratories for other countries in the region. delegates discussed the feasibility of sharing expertise across countries. the capacity in the western Balkan countries ranged between 70 (37 out of 53 diseases) and 85% (45 out of 53 diseases) only a few countries reported full capacity for rare and emerging diseases, such as smallpox, SARS, and yellow fever. LUENZAE, INVASIVE DISEASE (Haemophilus influenzae) HEPATITIS A (Hepatitis B virus) HEPATITIS C (Hepatitis C virus) INFLUENZA A (H1N1) LEGIONNAIRES' DISEASE (Legionella spp.) LEPTOSPIROSIS (Leptospira spp.) MEASLES (Measles virus) MEAS countries identified key issues in the organizational set up and structures of national laboratory systems supporting public health that need to be addressed. a majority of countries identified several key issues in the organizational set up and structures of national laboratory systems supporting public health. four out of six countries have a national database of all available microbiology laboratories operating in the public and private sectors. none of the countries have established an electronic laboratory data reporting system from microbiology laboratories to the public health central level. all six countries have the capacity to identify methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates. all countries except one have developed algorithms for sample referral for meningitis. only half of the countries have algorithms for sample referral for cases of diarrhea. there is a lack of support for clinical and reference laboratories for enteric disease/diarrhea diagnostics. the western Balkan region reported significant gaps in harmonized and effective procedures and logistical arrangements on cross-border transportation and handling of specimens of highly contagious agents. this is possibly due to a lack of legal basis/regulations enabling efficient sample transferral and intergovernmental collaboration. all Western Balkan countries acknowledged that their persistent financial constraints, if not addressed sufficiently, will ultimately lead to decreased numbers of laboratory workforce. european pre-accession countries should ensure formal agreements for collaboration are in place within and outside the countries. a regulatory framework for sample transfers is needed (within and outside the country), including the organization of the transportation process, handling of specimens, and intergovernmental collaboration. annual monitoring of laboratory capabilities based on the ECDC EULabCap indicator tool (10) customized for EU pre-accession countries could help countries promote necessary changes in national public health microbiology systems. system could improve public health, e.g., in settings lacking robust laboratory capacity (12), such as in countries of the western Balkan region. building resilient and responsive public health systems in countries of EU's neighborhood entails more than just enhancing technical capacities of epidemiology and public health microbiology systems."}
