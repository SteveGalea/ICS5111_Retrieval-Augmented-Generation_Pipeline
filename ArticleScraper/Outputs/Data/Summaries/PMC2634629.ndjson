{"summary": "114 bats collected from their natural habitats from December 2006 through July 2007 were euthanized after being deeply anesthetized with 2% xylazine and 10% ketamine administered subcutaneously. the carcasses were then taxonomically classified on the basis of morphology. for sampling, the carcasses were thawed at 4\u00b0C for 3\u20134 hours, then oropharyngeal and anal samples were taken with Dacron-tipped sw viral RNA was extracted from swabs by using the QIAamp viral RNA minikit. primers based on the RdRp gene were then used for RT-PCR detection. RNA from samples positive for coronavirus was then used for cDNA synthesis by using random hexamer, gene-specific, and oligo(dT) primer. s were trimmed to equal length, creating 2 datasets of 780 bp (n = 40) and 378 bp (n = 45) the latter included Bt-CoV sequences from North America and Germany. a third dataset comprised an alignment of the HEL domain (n = 46) trimmed to 1,797 bp. maximum likelihood tree of coronaviruses based on 378-bp fragment of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene. tree was inferred under the General Time Reversible (GTR + 4 + I) by using PAUP* version 4.0b. previously defined phylogenetic groups and a putative novel group (10) are delineated by the bars on the right. ML phylogenies inferred from the RdRp genes of 40 viruses (780 bp) and the HEL domains of 46 viruses (1,797 bp) were strongly supported with bootstrap values >95% in all cases. in each case the Trinidadian sequences clustered with group 1 CoVs within a clade containing all other group 1 bat and human CoVs as well as porcine CoV. group 1 CoVs form 2 well-supported clades designated 1a and 1b (12) the Trinidadian bt-CoV clustered within the latter clade contains all other group 1 Bt-CoVs, including those from Germany and North America, and the 3 known group 1 human CoVs associated with respiratory illness (13\u201315)."}
