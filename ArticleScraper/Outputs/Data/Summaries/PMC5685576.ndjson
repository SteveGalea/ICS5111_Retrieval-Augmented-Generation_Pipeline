{"summary": "a minimum quality assurance program is composed of quality control (QC), external quality assessment (EQA), standard operating procedure (SOP) and competency assessment (CA) of coworkers. despite their established role, QC are insufficient [11], especially because they do not cover pre- and post-analytical steps [10,16,17] PT only partially evaluates pre- and post-analytical steps. PT are not available for all the different tests offered by our laboratories. it has been shown that their recognition as EQA can lead to falsely reassuring results because of the extra caution given in their processing. the authors concluded that their works showed the capacity of this system to detect error, highlighted point of improvement and produced relevant data on the reproducibility of their results. a new IQA procedure was initiated in the three clinical laboratories (serology, molecular microbiology and conventional microbiology) this procedure was designed and implemented by the quality committee of our laboratories. the correspondence between the patient identification code and the replicate identification code was reported into a database for later comparison of the results. results of the matching samples were later reported into an Access database and data analyses were conducted with Microsoft Excel. the weighted version of Kappa score is used to consider partial agreements within ordered scales [37]. we adopted the weighting suggested by Cicchetti et Allison [38], which sanctions discrepancies in a linear and not in a quadratic method [39]. Quantitative variations were scored according to S1B Table. the head technicians of our three labs were instructed to secretly withdraw samples from the already processed ones. samples were chosen to be proportionally representative of the analyses done by our facilities, but also to test at least once every test offered by our service. the analysis request forms were replicated with anonymous identification data, which are commonly used in our institution for clinical research purposes. the most important discrepancy between all parameters of a pair of samples was recorded. the weighted version of Kappa score is used to consider the partial agreements within ordered scales [37]. discordant results were done by a data review committee of three persons (VS, CD and GG) a total of 121 (98.4%) were concordant. the first discordant test was a measure of IgG against cytomegalovirus (CMV) by enzyme immuno-assay (EIA), which was initially positive (index of 1.20) and intermediate when redone (0.953 for a cut-off for positivity of 1 and negative) 61.8% 10/122 6/10 Qualitative results 95.1% 6/122 6/6 182.8 (45.8) Quantitative results 82.6% 4/23 0/4 169.1/191.5/215.8 Microscopy 75.2%*1 185/745 13/71*2 10.3 (9.5) Culture 50.0% 43/86 13/43 AST Aggregated by panels 75.0% 12/48 1/12 5.0/6.5/8.2 Single antibiotics 96.4% 25 these 5 discordant results corresponding to EBV in blood (n = 3) and BKV in blood and urine (n = 2) DNA amplifications could be explained by stochastic repartition of nucleic acids. the remaining qualitatively discordant result corresponded to the detection of a coronavirus in a nasopharyngeal secretion. a nasopharyngeal secretion was initially reported at 505\u2019000 copies/ml and then reported at only 50\u2019000 copies/ml when redone, a difference not considered to be associated with a significant clinical impact. the third quantitatively discordant result corresponded to the detection of HSV-1 in a vaginal swab with a viral load of 9.61010 copies/ml versus 1.6108 copies/ml. 32 out of 81 (39.5%) pairs exhibited at least one major discrepancy. major discordances were observed in 5.3%, 4.9% and 3.7% for Gram-negative coccobacilli, Gram-negative bacilli and Gram-positive bacilli respectively. urines are examined under microscopy only if considered cloudy. no significant differences were observed when comparing the identical and negligible discrepant results versus the minor and major discrepant results. this absence of difference was recovered both when comparing all parameters together and bacteria and yeasts only. 96.3% 2 2.5% 0 0.0% 1 1.2% 81 96.3% N.R.

Suspicion of error in sample handling Enterococcus faecalis * (105 germs/ml) recovered only in patient\u2019s urinary sample, in otherwise agreeing results (Proteus vulgaris) difference explained by the usage of a Gram-positive selective agar plate. at least one major discrepancy was observed in five (10.4%) out of 48 comparable AST panels. 7 (14.6%) included at least one minor discrepancy. the remaining 36 AST panels (75.0%) were perfectly identical. a comment suggesting a request for AST via phone call 5 Diverging culture results, leading to different AST 15 Strain presence discrepancy considered as negligible in culture. there were 15 minor (sensitive versus intermediate or intermediate versus resistant) and 10 major (sensitive versus resistant) discrepancies. only antibiotics tested more than 10 times are represented. mycobacteria Five pairs of samples submitted to conventional microbiology or molecular biology laboratories also included auramine stains, culture and AST for mycobacteria. all the results were concordant, showing agreement on two positive samples and three negative samples. the second discordant pair of results was in the titers of a syphilis test (TPPA) obtained manually, being twice positive but with titers of 1/2'560 initially and 1/10\u2019240 when redone. the clinical impact was considered significant in this 2nd case since a high titer of 1/10\u2019240 generally reflects an acute infection. the limited number of discrepant results did not allow to investigate the effect of the time delays between the management of the six tests were qualitatively different, being once positive and once negative. four discordant molecular results corresponded to low positive samples. one initially negative result turned out to be positive at 100 copies/ml when retested. straight line represents the line of identity, expressing perfect match. low positive versus negative results (n = 5, diamonds); moderate positive versus negative results (n = 1, square); quantitative discrepancies with over one log10 difference in copies/ml. 92 negative agreeing results are not represented on this figure. 1.6108 copies/ml versus 1.6108 copies/ml, a difference identified to be due to a human transcription error since the Ct values were similar (19.8 and 19.0) the fourth quantitative discordance had little clinical impact (Table 1) despite the Ct difference (39.1 versus 35.4) since the calculated EBV viral load exhibited a difference of less than one log10 (182 versus 771 copies/ml) this relatively high overall agreement rate should be weighted by the common negativity of some parameters such as Gram-positive diplococci (100% of negativity), yeasts (96.3%) and Gram-negative coccobacilli (93.0%) the obtained overall agreement would drop significantly from 75.2% to 67.6%. 8% 81 33.3% 0.55 Epithelial cells 58 71.6% 11 13.6% 6 7.4% 6 7.4% 81 60.5% 0.62 GP cocci 49 60.5% 21 25.9% 4 4.9% 7 8.6% 81 46.9% 0.66 GP diplococci 57 100.0% 0 0.0% 0 0.0% 57 100.0% N.R.

Bifidobacterium spp (107 bacteria/ml) recovered only in the patient\u2019s urinary sample. the Enterococcus grew on a Gram-positive selective plate only used for the IQA sample because of abundant Gram-positive cocci seen under microscopy. possible error in samples handling, during the preparation of the sample, since Gram results were also discordant. low quantities of Klebsiella oxytoca group, Escherichia coli and C. albicans recovered only in the patient\u2019s sample. at least one major discrepancy was observed in five (10.4%) out of 48 comparable AST panels. 7 (14.6%) included at least one minor discrepancy. results 36 (75.0%) AST including at least one minor discrepancy 7 (14.6%) AST including at least one major discrepancy 5 (10.4%) Total 48 Major and minor categories as defined in S1C Table. as many as 23 AST panels, done on the patient sample or the IQA replicate, had no matching AST panel for its counterpart. Counts of concordant pairs of AST results are in green, minor discrepancies (sensitive versus intermediate or intermediate versus resistant) are in yellow and major discrepancies are in red. only antibiotics tested more than 10 times are represented. serological tests are achieved on sera, which are by nature homogenous. most discrepancies were due to stochastic variability of qPCR occurring around the limit of detection, where by definition qPCRs lose part of their sensitivity. almost 40% of the compared results included at least one discrepancy of more than two relative units, which we categorized as major. the other studies on the reproducibility of Gram stain use very different methodologies, such as comparison of the concordance between Gram stain and culture results. errors were typically suspected when discrepancies were not compatible with biological variations because they were of very large amplitude. despite the high proportion of discrepant cases, our experts concluded that most of them would have no clinical impact, mainly because they involved host cell quantifications and not detection of bacteria. culture is a dynamic process influenced by many factors, including heterogeneity of samples, Gram stains results, selected culture media, stochastic growth variability and interpretation of the clinical significance of the presence of colonies with choices to identify or not the grown colonies. we observed a low rate of significant discrepancies within the AST performed on identical bacteria. the serology laboratory is testing anterior results from the tested patients. despite this limitation, we consider that our process could still have an interest for IQA in serology laboratories, but that it would need to be partly redesigned. this way, each laboratory would play the role of reference laboratory for one fourth of all samples. such interlaboratory shared quality assurance would also help to provide \u201cexternal assurance\u201d for some serological and molecular parameters for which there is currently no EQA available. minor discrepancies are sensitive versus intermediate versus resistant. major discrepancies are sensitive versus resistant."}
