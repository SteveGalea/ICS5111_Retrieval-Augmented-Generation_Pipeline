{"summary": "steroid-associated osteonecrosis (ON) frequently occurs. it is highly desirable to develop agents which could prevent ON occurrence due to its generally poor surgical prognosis [1]\u2013[3]. the ideal strategy would be simultaneously target both intravascular thrombosis and extravascular lipid deposition for preventing steroid-associated ON development. a simplified procedure for isolating flavonoids from herbal Epimedium has been established. it generates seven major flavonoid compounds with common stem nuclei. the common structure is 8-prenylkaempferol. the common structure is 8-prenylkaempferol. study II was to use human umbilical vein endothelial cell model and 3T3-L1 preadipocyte model in vitro to detect the prevention effect of Icaritin, the detectable metabolite of the EF, as well as those seven prototype flavonoid glycosides. rabbits received a standard laboratory diet and water ad lititum. plasma and serum were prepared for evaluating endothelium damage index TM (Thrombomodulin) using established protocols [7], [14]\u2013[15] and detection of both prototype and metabolite of EF. serum hepatocyte injure indices, including Alanine aminitransperase (ALT) and Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), were examined for evaluating potential hepatocyte toxicity of EF. LC separation was conducted using an Agilent Series 1100HPLC system and a C18 reversed-phase column (5 m, 4.6 mm250 mm; Shimadzu, Japan) and 75% MeOH-H2O as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. the positive ion mode and MS/MS analysis were selected. the isolated MNCs were cultured for mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) in basal medium. the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C, 5% humidified CO2. after three days, the medium was changed and nonadherent hematopoietic cells were discarded. proximal femoral samples were embedded in paraffin, cut into 6-m-thick sections along the coronal plane for histopathological examination. identification of ON lesion was performed using established criteria, i.e. diffuse presence of empty lacunae or pyknotic nuclei of osteocytes in the trabeculae accompanied by surrounding necrotic bone marrow [20]\u2013[21]. study II In Vitro Study using human umbilical Vein Endothelial Cell Damage Model Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs, SC-8000, ScienCell Research Laboratories, USA) were maintained in commercialized Endothelial Cell Medium (SC-1001, ScienCell Research Laboratories, USA) these HUVECs were incubated in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C and passed every three supernate soluble TM was measured using commercialized human Thrombomodulin ELISA Kit (ab46508, Abcam, UK) all experiments were performed in triplicate. longitudinal quantification data were analyzed using \u2018ANOVA of Repeated Measures\u2019 with body weight as a covariant variable for eliminating its influence on the measurement results. all statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 10.0. plasma and serum were prepared for evaluating endothelium damage index TM (Thrombomodulin) using established protocols [7], [14]\u2013[15] and detection of both prototype and metabolite of EF. serum hepatocyte injure indices, including Alanine aminitransperase (ALT) and Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), were examined for evaluating potential hepatocyte toxicity of EF. LC separation was conducted using an Agilent Series 1100HPLC system and a C18 reversed-phase column (5 m, 4.6 mm250 mm; Shimadzu, Japan) and 75% MeOH-H2O as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. mass spectra were acquired and processed using the software provided by the manufacturer. isolated MNCs were cultured for mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) in basal medium. containing DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% mixture of penicillin, streptomycin and neomycin. after three days, the medium was changed and nonadherent hematopoietic cells were discarded. Sodium Pentobarbitone, the decalcified proximal femoral samples were embedded in Paraffin, cut into 6-m-thick sections along the coronal plane. identification of ON lesion was performed using established criteria, i.e. diffuse presence of empty lacunae or pyknotic nuclei of osteocytes in the trabeculae accompanied by surrounding necrotic bone marrow. rabbits were intravenously injected with 10 g. kg1 of Lippolysaccharide (LPS; Escherichia coli 0111:B4, Sigma-Aldrich, Inc. USA) on day 0 (week 0), 24 hours later, three injections of 20 mg. kg1 of Methylprednisolone (MPS; Pharmacia & Upjohn, USA) were given intramuscularly at a time interval of 24 hours. plasma and serum were prepared for evaluating endothelium damage index TM (Thrombomodulin) using established protocols [7], [14]\u2013[15] and detection of both prototype and metabolite of EF. serum hepatocyte injure indices, including Alanine aminitransperase (ALT) and Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), were examined for potential hepatocyte toxicity of EF. LC separation was conducted using an Agilent Series 1100HPLC system and a C18 reversed-phase column (5 m, 4.6 mm250 mm; Shimadzu, Japan) and 75% MeOH-H2O as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. the positive ion mode and MS/MS analysis were selected. the basal medium was repalced with an adipogenic medium for culture in two weeks. after 2 weeks in culture, the cells in vitro were stained with oil red O. the colonies cotaining adipocytes that are positive for Oil red O were considered as adipocytic colonies. Rabbit that had at least one ON lesion in the areas was considered as ON+, while that with no ON lesion was considered as ON. fifteen successive slices in each dissected proximal 1/3 part of bilateral femur samples of each rabbit were chosen. HUVECs were incubated in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C. the cells were incubated with LPS at a concentration of 0.625 g/ml for 24 hours. on an established protocol by manufacture, supernate soluble TM was measured using commercialized human Thrombomodulin ELISA Kit (ab46508, Abcam, UK) all experiments were performed in triplicate. longitudinal quantification data were analyzed using \u2018ANOVA of Repeated Measures\u2019 with body weight as a covariant variable. all statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 10.0. Statistical significance for compaison was set at P0.05. supernate soluble TM was measured using commercialized human Thrombomodulin ELISA Kit (ab46508, Abcam, UK) all experiments were performed in triplicate. longitudinal quantification data were analyzed using \u2018ANOVA of Repeated Measures\u2019 with body weight as a covariant variable for eliminating its influence on the measurement results. results prevention Efficacy and safety evaluation Neither organ bleeding nor death was found in any group throughout the experimental period. there was no significant change from baseline in ALT (A) and AST (B) when compared to the CON group. significantly increased TM (C) from baseline was attenuated in the CON group or prevented in both the M-EF and H-EF group at week 1 post induction. adipocyte positive colonies (D) in the CON group were attenuated in the L-EF group or prevented in both the M-EF and H-EF group after induction. the increased Thrombotic Vessel Counts in the CON group were either attenuated in the L-EF group or prevented in both the M-EF and H-EF groups. the increased Thrombotic Vessel Counts in the CON group were either attenuated in the L-EF group or prevented in both the M-EF and H-EF groups. marrow was predominantly occupied by numerous fat cells in the CON group after induction. the Fat Cell Area Fraction in the CON group increased signficantly at week 1 post induciton and then maintained until week 2 post indcution (P0.05 for both) there was a significant difference in the changing pattern between the CON group and the three EF groups. significant decrease in the PEP in the CON group was attenuated in the L-EF group and almost prevented in both the M-EF and H-EF group at week 1 post induction. a total ion chromatogram in full scan mode was generated by HPLC/UV/MS/MS. the +MS showed the mass weight by 391 ion (m/z [M+Na]+) and the absence of 56 exhibited the existence of prenyl in the +MS2 chromatography. seven prototype flavonoids in EF at the concentration of 1014 M could not decrease the supernate soluble TM compared to the induction group. supernate soluble TM in endotoxin induction group (A) and optical density in destained oil red O staining (B) were significantly higher than the corresponding control group, respectively. Icaritin dose-dependently lowered supernate soluble TM (A) and optical density in destained oil red O staining (B) compared to the corresponding induction group. there was no significant difference in the ON Extent among the CON group (2.80.8), L-EF group (2.50.6), M-EF group (2.40.7) and H-EF group (2.60.5) there was no significant difference in the ON Extent among the CON group (2.80.8), ALT (A) and AST (B) when compared to the CON group. the increased Thrombotic Vessel Counts in the CON group increased to peak level at week 1 post induciton, and then maintained until week 2 post indcution. there was no significant difference in ON Extent among all the groups. the significant increase in TM in the CON group was either attenuated in the L-EF group or almost prevented in both the M-EF and H-EF group at week 1 post induction. there was a significant difference in the changing pattern between the CON group and the three EF groups. PEP in the CON group decreased significantly at week 1 post-induction (P0.01) then significantly increased over the baseline at week 2 post-induction (P0.01) there was a significant difference in the changing pattern of the PEP over time between the CON group and three EF groups (P0.01 for L-EF vs CON, P0.01 for both M-EF vs CON and H-EF vs CON) the +MS showed the mass weight by 391 ion (m/z [M+Na]+) and the absence of 56 exhibited the existence of prenyl in the +MS2 chromatography. seven prototype flavonoids in EF at the concentration of 1014 M could not decrease the supernate soluble TM compared to the induction group. no differences were found between the seven flavonoids in EF at the concentration of 1014 M and the induction group in optical density in destained oil red O staining (Figure 5C). however, no differences were found between the seven parent flavonoids in EF at the concentration of 1014 M and the induction group in optical density in steroid induction group (B) the groups suggested a threshold beyond which development of ON lesion was initiated. the prevention with EF had little effect on development of ON. hepatic safety is also an important concern. a high level of Adipocyte Positive Colonies was considered to reflect excessive adipogenesis. the results showed that excessive adipogenesis occurred at early stage of steroid-associated ON development. a significant increase in TM in the CON group at week 1 post induction was attenuated in the L-EF group or almost prevented in both the M-EF and H-EF group. significantly decreased PEP in the CON group at week 1 post-induction indicated insufficient vascular perfusion at an early stage. results also indicated that EF was able to dose-dependently protect endothelium from injuring. EF was either attenuated in the L-EF group or almost prevented in both the M-EF and H-EF group. the in vitro data from 3T3-L1 Preadipocyte model in the present study showed dose-dependent measurable protection effect of Icaritin on endotoxin-induced damage of human umbilical vein endothelial cell. the in vitro data from human umbilical vein endothelial cell model in the present study showed dose-dependent measurable protection effect of Icaritin on steroid-induced lipid deposition of 3T3-L1 Preadipocyte gluconolactone, a broad specificity glycosidase inhibitor, can cause limited hydrolysis of flavonoid glycosides. gluconolactone could be employed to limit the hydrolysis of EF. a novel small molecule Icaritin would emerge into effective prevention of steroid-associated ON. EF was a potential phytotherapeutic agent for reducing risk of steroid-associated ON in a dose-dependent manner. no significant difference in the ON Extent among all the groups suggested a threshold beyond which development of ON was initiated. hepatic safety is also an important concern. dependent Influence on Inhibiting Extravascular Events Histopathological examination suggested that EF was able to dose-dependently inhibit extravascular lipid deposition. elevated adipogenesis occurred at early stage of steroid-associated ON development, which was evidenced by the significantly increased level of Adipocyte Positive Colonies in the CON group. endothelium TM is a cell surface glycoprotein that is expressed in endothelial cells and plays a role in counteracting both coagulation and hypofibrinolysis. a significant increase in TM in the CON group at week 1 post induction was found, which was also corresponding to a published study. in vitro data from 3T3-L1 Preadipocyte model showed dose-dependent measurable protection effect of Icaritin on endotoxin-induced damage. however, no differences were found between the seven parent flavonoids in EF and the induction group in the supernate soluble TM. this finding was consistent with recent studies that Icaritin was the primary intestinal metabolite of prenyl flavonoids from Epimedium [29] Icaritin, the metabolite of EF, inhibited both thrombosis and lipid-deposition for reducing incidence of steroid-associated ON in a dose-dependent manner. a novel small molecule Icaritin would emerge into effective prevention of steroid-associated ON. ed dose-dependent effect on inhibition of thrombosis and lipid-deposition. underlying mechanism could be explained by counteraction effects on endothelium injury and excessive adipogenesis."}
