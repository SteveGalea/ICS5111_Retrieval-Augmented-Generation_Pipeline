{"summary": "human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a paramyxovirus responsible for acute respiratory tract infections that are especially severe in young children [1,2], elderly people [3,4] and immunocompromized individuals [5,6] hMPV infection is associated with the disruption of the epithelial architecture and the presence of inflammatory infiltrates around and within alveoli. ribavirin is associated with many side-effects and teratogenicity. the development of new antivirals and/or immunomodulatory strategies is warranted for the treatment of severe hMPV infections. the role of PAR1 in the pathogenesis of infectious diseases has recently been investigated for a number of pathogens including feline immunodeficiency virus [38], mycobacterium tuberculosis [39], dengue virus [40], herpes simplex virus [41,42] and influenza A virus [43,44]. for the latter pathogen, upregulation of PAR1 was observed in the airways of mice infected with the highly pathogenic influenza A/PR-8/34 (H1 no antiviral effect was observed using concentrations up to 250 M of the PAR1 agonist (TFLLR-NH2) in a second experiment, hMPV was pre-incubated with the compounds (maximum concentration of 0.8 M) before addition to LLC-MK2 monolayers. no antiviral effect was again observed when the compounds were removed and replaced by fresh medium. titers in the lungs of PAR1 antagonist-treated mice were significantly lower than those of vehicle-treated mice by about 1 log. titers in the lungs were significantly lower than those of vehicle-treated mice by about 1 log. a 3-day treatment with the PAR1 antagonist (SCH79797) reduced weight loss in a dose-dependent manner. in order to evaluate if a longer treatment had a more pronounced effect, the compound was administered as a single daily dose of 500 M for 5 days. the compound was administered as a single daily dose of 500 M for 5 days, starting at the time of infection. on day 5 pi, 6 mice per group were euthanized and lungs removed, fixed, embedded, sectioned and stained for histopathology. significant differences in pulmonary histopathological scores were observed between treated and untreated mice based on a two-way ANOVA. significantly reduced populations of activated dendritic cells, macrophages and CD4- T-lymphocytes were observed in the lungs of PAR1 antagonist-treated mice compared to hMPV-infected untreated mice. however, there appears to be a decrease in neutrophils in infected untreated mice. proprotein convertases, especially furin, process a number of cell surface glycoproteins of infectious viruses at single and paired basic residues. the minimal cleavage site is RXXR, exhibiting a P1 and P4 Arg residues [46]. treatment of hMPV-infected mice with either the PAR1 agonist or antagonist did not alter F cleavage (43.7 and 41.2% cleavage, respectively, compared to 36.8%) co-transfection of cells with cDNA encoding the F protein, furin as well as recombinant human PAR1 (rhPAR1) reduced F cleavage from 36.8% to 12.4%. western blot analysis of cell lysates using an anti-V5 mAb. cell lysates were analyzed using an anti-V5 mAb. hMPV was pre-incubated with compounds before addition to LLC-MK2 monolayers. PAR1 agonist and antagonist have an inverse dose-dependent effect on hMPV infection in vivo. groups of 12 mice were infected intranasally with hMPV (4-6x105 TCID50) or mock infected and simultaneously treated intranasally, for a period of 3 days, with a single daily dose of 50 or 500 M of PAR1 agonist (TFLLR-NH2) or PAR1 antagonist (SCH79797) a 3-day treatment with the PAR1 antagonist (SCH79797) reduced weight loss in a dose-dependent manner. the compound was administered as a single daily dose of 500 M for 5 days, starting at the time of infection. the findings were confirmed in a second experiment using 18 mice per group. on day 5 pi, a significant decrease in pulmonary inflammation was observed in treated mice. viral replication in the lungs on day 5 pi, was significantly reduced by about 1 log in PAR1 antagonist-treated mice. significant differences in pulmonary pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine levels were observed between treated and untreated mice. no detectable values were obtained for these cytokines in any of the groups. fected mice treated with the PAR1 antagonist were infected intranasally with hMPV. groups of 6 mice were infected intranasally with hMPV. lungs were removed, homogenized in HBSS and analyzed. hMPV infection resulted in a significant increase in furin transcripts. treatment of infected mice with the PAR1 antagonist significantly reduced furin transcript levels. furin was the only tested proprotein convertase that was able to cleave the hMPV fusion precursor protein into its active form. hMPV-infected mice were treated intranasally with hMPV or mock infected. RNA was extracted and furin transcript levels were determined using RT-PCR. hMPV-infected mice were treated with a plasmid encoding the hMPV F protein. hMPV infection causes a wide spectrum of diseases from mild upper respiratory tract infections (RTI) to severe lower RTI such as bronchiolitis or pneumonia. hMPV is one of the most prominent respiratory pathogens in children. we used an agonist (TFLLR-NH2) and an antagonist (SCH79797) of PAR1 to investigate the role of this receptor during hMPV infection. we examined its well-known effect on intestinal permeability [55] in wild-type and PAR1-knockout mice. pulmonary inflammation mostly consists of interstitial, perivascular and alveolar inflammation. all these parameters were significantly reduced by treatment with the PAR1 antagonist. we also showed a significant reduction in the levels of key cytokines that are usually increased in hMPV infection. dritic cells and its activation induces the release of MCP-1, IL-10, and IL-12 from these cells. a significant reduction in dendritic cells present in the lungs of PAR1 antagonist-treated mice compared to untreated hMPV-infected mice. it remains to be confirmed whether these CD4- T-lymphocytes represent cytolytic T lymphocytes. the use of immunomodulators for viral infections has been most extensively investigated for chronic infections such as HIV and viral hepatitis infections. the use of immunomodulators for viral infections has been most extensively investigated for chronic infections such as HIV. rhPAR1 antagonist-treated and infected mice had reduced pulmonary viral titers on day 5 pi. this observation suggests a direct or indirect effect on viral replication. however, testing was limited by cytotoxicity so we cannot rule out a direct antiviral effect. PAR1 antagonists have been shown to decrease the plasmin-mediated cleavage of the influenza hemagglutinin protein with subsequent reduction in mouse lung viral titers. this could explain the slight reduction in viral titers observed in the lungs of hMPV-infected mice. hMPV group A strain C-85473, a clinical isolate that was passaged nine to ten times on LLC-MK2 cells, was grown on LLC-MK2 cells in OptiMEM (Life technologies, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) the same protocol was used with 16 flasks of uninfected mice.
