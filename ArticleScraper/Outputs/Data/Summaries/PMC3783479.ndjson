{"summary": "new influenza virus subtypes have infected humans and caused significant public health concerns. in 2009, a new swine/human/avian-origin H1N1 influenza virus emerged in Mexico and resulted in a worldwide pandemic. in 2009, a new swine/human/avian-origin H1N1 influenza virus emerged in 2009. immunization with recombinant adenovirus (rAd/NP) vaccines encoding conserved influenza antigens such as NP and M2e generated cross-reactive immune responses. this could offer broad-range cross-protection against multiple strains of influenza virus in mice. virus with the only HA genes of A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) origin in the genetic background of the high-growth strain A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) was grown in the embryonated chicken eggs. the allantoic fluid was collected and stored at -70\u00b0C. rAd/Mock was generated by the same method using the vacant pShuttle-CMV vector. the recombinant adenoviruses were amplified on HEK293 cells and purified by double CsCl2 density-gradient ultracentrifugation. s.l. groups were secondarily immunized by the same procedure two weeks after primary immunization. mice were lightly anesthetized by isoflurane and challenged i.n. with 10 LD50 of PR8, CA04, A/Philippines or A/Vietnam. 107 PFU of PR8 virus in allantoic fluid was disrupted with 0.5% Triton X-100. 96-well plates were coated with 100 l/well of split influenza virus diluted in PBS. then blocked with PBS containing 1% non-fat milk and 0.05% Tween 20 for 2 h at RT. color development was analyzed at 450 nm by a Thermo Multiskan\u00ae EX. lungs perfused with 5 ml PBS including 10 U/ml heparin. tissues were homogenized with 3 ml Iscove\u2019s Modified Dulbecco\u2019s Medium. after centrifugation, lymphocytes were resuspended in fresh IMDM. after washing with IMDM, cells were washed two times with FACS buffer. mouse-adapted influenza virus strains of A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (abbreviated PR8, H1N1) virus, A/California/04/09 (CA04, H1N1), A/Philippines/2/82 (A/Philippines, H3N2), and A/Vietnam/1203/04-PR8/CDC-RG-attenuated (A/Vietnam, H5N1) were used in this study RT-PCR using forward primer (5\u2019-GGGTACCGCCACCATGGCGTCCCAAGGCACC-3\u2019) that contains a stop codon and an XbaI restriction enzyme site at 3\u2019 terminus. the whole open reading frame was digested with Kpn I/Xba I double digestion and inserted into the pShuttle-CMV vector. recombinant adenoviral DNA containing the NP gene was transfected into HE 5 week-old mice were inoculated with varying doses of rAd/NP vaccine. for i.n. immunization, mice were lightly anesthetized by isoflurane. for s.l. immunization, mice were lightly anesthetized by isoflurane. subsets of mice were sacrificed and tracheotomy was executed. blood was acquired from the retro-orbital plexus by a heparinized capillary tube. -tetramethylbenzidine (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD) was added and stopped by adding 1 M H3PO4. the color development was analyzed at 450 nm by a Thermo Multiskan\u00ae EX (Vantaa, Finland) cells were stained with anti-mouse CD8a-APC (clone 53-6.7; Biolegend, San Diego, CA), anti-mouse CD44-FITC (clone IM7; Biolegend) and Kd/NP147-155 (TYQRTRALV)-tetramer-PE. difference comparison was conducted using an unpaired, two-tailored Student t-test. in rAd/NP-infected HEK293 cell lysates, no band was detected in uninfected HEK293 cell lysates or rAd/Mock-infected HEK293 cell lysates. however, no such band was detected in uninfected HEK293 cell lysates or rAd/Mock-infected HEK293 cell lysates that were used as all mice immunized intranasally received a single immunization with the indicated dose of rAd/NP or rAd/Mock. all i.n. and s.l. vaccination groups that received rAd/NP elicited significant levels of PR8-specific serum IgG compared to control mice given rAd/Mock. lenge following rAd/NP immunization significantly increases PR8-specific serum IgG levels in intranasally immunized mice. mice were immunized intranasally or sublingually with 1107 or 1108 PFU of rAd/NP. mice that previously received rAd/NP via sublingual route were boosted with the same dose of rAd/NP used during the primary immunization. PR8-challenge following 1108 PFU of rAd/NP immunization increases PR8-specific mucosal IgA levels in intranasally immunized mice. however, we did not detect PR8-specific mucosal IgAs in BAL collected from mice that were given rAd/NP via s.l. route. this suggests that rAd vector-based vaccine expressing the NP gene of PR8 virus is all immunized mice were then challenged with a lethal dose of PR8. at day 5 post-challenge, mice lungs were harvested and Kd/NP147-155 tetramer-specific CD8 T-cell frequency was determined via flow cytometry. this increase in NP-specific CD8 T-cell recruitment was dose-dependent. BALB/c mice were immunized intranasally or sublingually with rAd/NP. mice that received rAd/NP via sublingual route were boosted two weeks after primary vaccination. mice in all vaccination groups were challenged intranasally with 10 LD50 of PR8 virus. ve mice succumbed to PR8 infection by day 9 post-challenge. rAd/NP immunization protects mice from weight loss and mortality. rAd/NP immunization protects mice from homologous virus challenge. immune mice were challenged at 3 weeks after their last respective immunization regimen. first, to investigate protective efficacy of rAd/NP immunization against heterologous influenza virus infection. mice were challenged with a lethal dose of CA04 and monitored daily for body weight change and mortality. mice were challenged with a lethal dose of influenza A/Philippines (H3N2) or A/Vietnam (H5N1) and monitored daily for body weight change and mortality. i.n. immunization with 1108 PFU of rAd/NP provided 40% of protection against the challenge with the same dose of H5N1 virus. i.n. immunization of rAd/NP during heterologous H1N1 or heterosubtypic H3N2 virus challenge. results suggest a high dose intranasal immunization may be required to confer complete protection against H5N1 virus challenge. d/NP immunization can be successfully recalled during a subsequent heterosubtypic influenza virus infection. d/NP immunization can be successfully recalled during a subsequent heterosubtypic influenza virus infection. rAd/NP-infected HEK293 cell lysates were immunized intranasally or sublingually with either 1107 or 1108 PFU of rAd/NP. no such band was detected in uninfected HEK293 cell lysates. sublingually primed mice were boosted two weeks after their first immunization using the same vaccination scheme used during their priming. however, all mice immunized intranasally received a single immunization with the indicated dose of rAd/NP or rAd/Mock. the levels of PR8-specific serum IgG in the immune sera were determined via ELISA using detergent-disrupted PR8 virus as the coating antigen. immunizations with rAd/NP elicit considerable levels of PR8 NP-specific serum IgGs. PR8-challenge following rAd/NP immunization significantly increases PR8-specific serum IgG levels compared to that of pre-challenge levels in intranasally immunized mice. PR8-challenge following 1108 PFU of rAd/NP immunization increases PR8-specific mucosal IgA levels compared to that of pre-challenge levels in intranasally immunized mice. however, we did not detect PR8-specific mucosal IgAs in BAL collected from mice that were given rAd/NP via s.l. route. d/NP vaccination and subsequent PR8-challenge were evaluated. mice were immunized i.n. once with either 1107 or 1108 PFU of rAd/NP or immunized s.l. with rAd/NP. all immunized mice were then challenged with a lethal dose of PR8. control mice were immunized intranasally with 1107 PFU or 1108 PFU of rAd/NP. mice in all vaccination groups were challenged intranasally with 10 LD50 of PR8 virus three weeks after their last immunization. rAd/NP immunization protects mice from weight loss and mortality following homologous PR8 challenge. control mice were immunized intranasally with 1107 PFU or 1108 PFU of rAd/NP. rAd/NP immunization protects mice from weight loss and mortality. immune mice were challenged at 3 weeks after their last immunization regimen. first, to investigate the protective efficacy of rAd/NP immunization against heterologous and heterosubtypic influenza virus infection. mice were challenged with a lethal dose of CA04 and monitored daily for body weight change and mortality. mice in all vaccination groups were challenged with 10 LD50 of CA04 (H1N1) virus, A/Philippines (H3N2) virus, or A/Vietnam (H5N1) virus. i.n. immunization with 1108 PFU of rAd/NP provided 40% of protection against the challenge with same dose of H5N1 virus. rAd/NP immunization via i.n. route, but not s.l. route, provides complete protection against heterologous H1N1 and heterosubtypic H3N2 virus challenges. a high dose intranasal immunization may be required to confer protection against H5N1 virus challenge. i.n. rAd/NP immunization recalled NP-specific CD8 T cells. rAd/NP immunization and heterosubtypic influenza virus challenge. the BALB/c mice were challenged with 10 LD50 of A/Philippines (H3N2) previous studies have identified influenza A virus NP as a major target antigen for cross-reactive influenza virus-specific CD8 T cells. we engineered a recombinant adenovirus expressing full-length NP derived from PR8 influenza virus as a potential vaccine candidate. however, pre-existing vector immunity could interfere with vaccine efficacy in scenarios requiring multiple booster vaccinations. rAd/NP immunization increases the frequency of NP-specific CD8 T cells recruited to the lungs of i.n. immunized mice following homologous challenge with PR8 virus. rAd/NP immunization increases the frequency of NP-specific CD8 T cells recruited to the lungs of i.n. immunized mice following homologous challenge with PR8 virus. i.n. immunization failed to confer complete protection against the lethal challenge with heterosubtypic H3N2 virus. only 40% of mice in the group that were given 1108 PFU dose of rAd/NP survive this lethal challenge. a single i.n. administration of rAd/NP confer cross-protection against lethal challenge by different influenza virus strains. i.n. immunization with rAd/NP can induce protective immunity against different strains of influenza virus by priming for cross-reactive NP-specific CTL response."}
