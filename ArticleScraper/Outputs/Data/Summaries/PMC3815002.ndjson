{"summary": "AGE is characterized by the onset of diarrhea with or without vomiting. it is one of the most common causes of hospitalization and is associated with a substantial disease burden. globally, about 10.6 million children still die every year before reaching their fifth birthday. the severity of acute diarrhea is related to etiology, with rotavirus infection disproportionately implicated in severe cases that frequently require hospitalization. rotavirus infection accounts for more than 50% of hospitalizations for gastroenteritis and about one-third of emergency department visits. mortality risk for very low-birth-weight infants due to acute diarrhea is 100 times higher than for infants of low or appropriate birth weight (more than 1500 g) mortality risk for very low-birth-weight infants due to acute diarrhea is 100 times higher than for infants of low or appropriate birth weight (more than 1500 g) s of age Acute diarrhea with or without blood or mucus in stool >1 week in only 10%\u201320% Malaise Abdominal pain Abdominal tenderness Fever Nausea Vomiting Headache Myalgia Arthralgia Contact with farm animals. EIEC can cause systemic infection especially in children 5 years. watery (ETEC, EPEC, EAEC) or bloody diarrhea and dysentery (ETEC, STEC, EHEC) Variable, depending on the pathotype and the age. salmonella spp 20\u201324 months in resource-constrained nations. Usually loose, nonbloody, moderate volume. large volume, bloody stools, or symptoms of dysentery do not rule out the diagnosis. yersinia enterocolitica Children 5 years of age Mucoid diarrhea, containing leukocytes, with or without blood 1\u20133 weeks Fever, Abdominal cramps Most commonly transmitted through undercooked pork meat. it has been suggested as a cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in infants. the dysentery lasts 3 to 4 weeks 90% of infections produce a spectrum of clinical syndromes ranging from dysentery to abscesses of the liver or ther organs. weight loss, fatigue, abdominal pain are seen. Very young children seem predisposed to fulminant colitis. some bacteria directly invade the intestinal mucosa, causing an inflammatory response of the host, while others cause damage by producing toxins. pathogenic role of A. hydrophila as an enteric pathogen causing gastroenteritis is difficult to confirm. enterotoxin production has been more frequently observed in isolates from resource-constrained nations where infection by C. jejuni has been associated with watery diarrhea. the clinical significance of the toxigenicity of these organisms is still unclear. in the last 5\u20137 years, a change in the epidemiologic pattern of C. difficile infection has been observed. the clinical presentation of C. difficile-associated disease can range from asymptomatic carriage in the gastrointestinal tract to potentially fatal pseudomembranous colitis. enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) serotypes in the past were associated with serious outbreaks of diarrhea in newborn nurseries in the us. they remain an important cause of acute infantile diarrhea in resource-constrained nations. most outbreaks and sporadic cases of bloody diarrhea and HUS have been attributed to strains of STEC serotype O157:H7. however, the role of non-O157 STEC strains as causes of HUS, bloody diarrhea, and other gastrointestinal illnesses is being increasingly recognized. in an urban slum, H. pylori infection was twice as common among subjects with typhoid fever (Salmonella typhi)46. in a Thai orphanage, no association was found between seroconversion and diarrheal disease. some investigators have even speculated local inflammatory factors induced by infection may be protective. domonas aeruginosa can colonize the intestine of the newborn during the first days of life. the infection may be asymptomatic at first, later developing into grayish-blue stool color or watery diarrhea. 3%\u20135% of infants may have extraintestinal symptoms. yersinia enterocolitica is a common enteropathogen usually causing relatively mild disease. children infected present acute diarrhea associated with fever and pharyngitis, chronic or recurrent diarrhea, or abdominal pain associated with mesenteric adenitis. pathogen, within phagocytes, can reach other sites through the bloodstream. water is the most common source of outbreaks and may include water from municipal supplies, wells, recreational lakes, and water stored aboard cruise ships. most cases occur during winter in temperate climates and during the rainy season in tropical climates Rotavirus (Reoviridae family) Children 5 years of age (predominant between 12 and 24 months) infected food handlers prepare salads, sandwiches, and other foods that require no cooking can spread the disease Winter disease in the temperate zones. rotavirus is present all year round Viruses are responsible for approximately 70% of the episodes of acute gastroenteritis in children. most people who are infected with a non-polio enterovirus (EV; family Picornaviridae, genus Enterovirus) have no disease, but all EV may cause diarrhea. a large increase in respiratory disease associated with EV-D68 has been reported in the last 3 years. 68 human bocavirus (family Parvoviridae, genus Mamastrovirus) may also be responsible for sporadic infections or epidemics, occasionally in newborns and children. a new coronavirus was found to be a causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome. norovirus has a major role in both epidemic and sporadic cases of gastroenteritis. the illness is milder than that caused by noroviruses. nearly all children are infected with sapoviruses by the time they are 5 years of age. Candida infection can cause intestinal symptoms similar to necrotizing enterocolitis. symptoms include prolonged secretory diarrhea with abdominal pain and cramping but without blood, mucus, fever, nausea, or vomiting. infection.91 is one of the intestinal protozoa that cause public health problems in most resource-constrained nations. many infected persons can be asymptomatic, leading to difficulties in the eradication and control of this parasite due to the number of potential carriers, such as school children. nondysenteric diarrhea is a common presentation of amebiasis in children less than 2 years of age. nondysenteric diarrhea is a common presentation of amebiasis in children less than 2 years of age but also among children aged 2\u201312 years of age. the pathogenic role of A. hydrophila as an enteric pathogen causing gastroenteritis is difficult to confirm. but a. hydrophila is recognized increasingly as a clinically significant enteric pathogen associated with diarrhea also in children younger than 2 years of age living in rural communities. newborn infection by Campylobacter spp is rare; most cases were born to mothers with Campylobacter diarrhea at the time of delivery. the transplacental passage of Campylobacter fetus is responsible for abortion, premature birth and bacteremia. the clinical presentation of C. difficile-associated disease can range from asymptomatic carriage in the gastrointestinal tract to potentially fatal pseudomembranous colitis. 5%\u201310% of patients have bloody diarrhea, but approximately 5%\u201310% have bloody diarrhea. enterohemorrhagic E. coli serotypes are a major cause of traveler\u2019s diarrhea and diarrhea in children in resource-constrained nations. serotypes number about 50 and in rich countries are primarily responsible for gastroenteritis with bloody diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, and cramps that resolve in a few days with an adequate oral rehydration. a significant association between illness and consumption of pink or undercooked hamburgers, pinkish ground beef, undercooked meat, or barbecued food has been demonstrated. the natural reservoirs of STEC are ruminant animals, especially cattle, and transmission to humans usually occurs via contaminated food or water. no association was found between seroconversion and diarrheal disease. some investigators have even speculated that local inflammatory factors induced by infection may be protective. pylori decreased gastric acid secretion in some people. 3%\u20135% of infants may have extraintestinal symptoms. the colonization and initial invasion likely occur at the distal ileum. mucosal edema and cryptic abscesses are frequently in the colon. ngitis, chronic or recurrent diarrhea, or abdominal pain associated with mesenteric adenitis. the pathogen, within phagocytes, can reach other sites through the bloodstream. some of the Y. enterocolitica pathogenic biotypes express the yst gene encoding for an enterotoxin. norovirus disease is also called \u201cwinter vomiting disease\u201d Sapovirus Children 5 years of age Mild, self-limiting, nonbloody diarrhea 2\u20133 days Occasionally fever and vomiting Mainly transmitted via fecal-oral route and consumption of contaminated food. most cases occur during winter in temperate climates and during rainy season in tropical climates Rotavirus (Reoviridae family) enteric adenoviruses are a common cause of viral gastroenteritis in infants and young children. only serotypes 40 and 41 cause gastroenteritis and are difficult to grow in tissue culture. non-polio enterovirus (EV; family Picornaviridae, genus Enterovirus) have no disease, but all EV may cause diarrhea. EV71 infections can be asymptomatic or can cause diarrhea, rashes, and hand, foot, and mouth disease. cases of fatal EV71 encephalitis have occurred during outbreaks. human coronaviruses (HCoVs; family Coronaviridae, genus Coronavirus) are common causes of upper respiratory tract infections. a new coronavirus was found to be a causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) nearly all children are infected with sapoviruses by the time they are 5 years of age. the illness most likely is sporadic with a high rate of asymptomatic infection. enterocolitis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in neonatal intensive care units. infection-associated mortality following Candida bloodstream infections is as high as 40% (very low birth weight 2%\u201330%, extremely low birth weight 12%\u201350%) Giardia lamblia is observed almost three times more in asymptomatic children than in symptomatic children. the first signs of acute giardiasis include nausea, loss of appetite and an upper gastro-intestinal uneasiness. the acute stage usually resolves spontaneously in a few days. strongyloidiasis is an infection caused by the intestinal nematode Strongyloides stercoralis. infected healthy individuals are usually asymptomatic; however, it can cause watery or chronic diarrhea, abdominal cramping, failure to thrive, and cachexia. feces, the clinical history of the disease, and environmental risk factors can support the diagnostic evaluation. it would be important to be aware of any history of recent contact with someone with acute diarrhea and/or vomiting and exposure to a known source of enteric infection. virus, adenovirus, or astrovirus are more indicative of an invasive germ, such as salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter jejuni, or Yersinia enterocolitica. the presence of vomiting and fever with diarrhea is nonspecific and cannot help in the diagnosis. stool specimens should be delivered to the laboratory as soon as possible, as a delay may compromise bacterial pathogen recovery. a single stool specimen, properly collected and promptly submitted will. the presence of leukocytes is a sign of intolerance to carbohydrates. infection mediated by enterotoxins (ETEC, Vibrio cholerae, and viruses) have no white blood cells in stool. PCR methods have been applied to investigate the prevalence of the virulence genes specific for five major patho-groups of diarrheagenic Escherichia coli. another study investigated using PCR for the incidence, antimicrobial resistance, and genetic relationships of EPEC in children with diarrhea. antibacterial substances, such as lactoferrin, lysozyme, phagocytes, and specific secretory immunoglobulins play a protective role. ligand-specific action of -casein inhibits Helicobacter pylori adherence to the gastric mucosa. this is confirmed by a recent Cochrane review documenting that LGG reduced the duration of diarrhea, mean stool frequency on day 2 and the risk of diarrhea lasting 4 days. a more recent review confirmed that S. boulardii significantly reduced the duration of diarrhea and hospitalization. treatment Rehydration therapy Dehydration is probably the main complication of gastroenteritis in childhood. the presence of one of these signs or symptoms immediately classifies the patient as a more severe case. oral rehydration via nasogastric tube Administer within first 4 hours. 200\u2013400 mL Children 4\u201311 months (5\u20137.9 kg): 400\u2013600 mL Children 13\u201323 months (8\u201310.9 kg): 600\u2013800 mL Children 2\u20134 years (11\u201315.9 kg): 800\u20131200 mL Children 5\u2013years (16\u201329.9 kg): 1200\u20132200 mL Children over 15 years and adults if the pulse is weak or the capillary perfusion is greater than 2 seconds, increase the speed of perfusion 2. Oral rehydration Start oral rehydration as soon as the patient is able to drink. in the 1960s, efforts by young scientists and researchers led to the development of ORT for the treatment of dehydration that often accompanies acute attacks of diarrhea. they developed a new framework for treatment that would soon be adopted throughout the developing world as a key element in the overall strategy to combat acute diarrhea and the potentially fatal dehydration. the most important aspect of treatment of gastroenteritis is the water and electrolyte balance. it must be adjusted according to serum electrolytes, body water content, and the water demand must be calculated on the weight of the newborn infant. infants with moderate dehydration, suspected infected by EHEC, should be hospitalized. to age Premature Infant 1 year old 3 years old 9 years old Adult Weight (kg) 1.5 3 10 15 30 70 Body surface area (m2) 0.15 0.2 0.5 0.6 1 1.7 Liquid body weight (%) 80 78 65 60 60 60 Extracellular fluid (%) 50 45 25 20 20 20 Intracellular fluid (%) 30 33 40 40 40 40 40 Note: 2009 Biomedia.

Efficacy and safety were demonstrated in comparison with liposomal amphotericin B and fluconazole. the most appropriate dose in children weighing less than 40 kg is 2 mg/kg/day in the treatment of invasive candidiasis and or gastroenteritis. 187,188 Giardia lamblia is a protozoan pathogen most commonly treated with metronidazole or tinidazole. failures occur in 10%\u201320% of cases. albendazole may be of similar effectiveness to metronidazole. Ivermectin is the first-choice therapy because of its higher tolerance, and albendazole is the second-choice therapy. heavy infestations may cause mechanical or inflammatory damage to the mucosa, abdominal pain, profuse or chronic diarrhea, and bloody diarrhea. 100\u2013200 mL of ORS, after each evacuation, providing a volume similar to the assessed fluid loss (gastrointestinal and urinary) up to 2 L daily Moderatea (3%\u20138% weight loss) Sunken eyes with ocular hypotony Absence of tears Dryness of the oral mucosa, tongue, and mucous membrane Intense thirst, drinks eagerly Skin pinch goes back slowly (1\u20132 seconds) Oral rehydration salts and close clinical monitoring, especially in children under 18 0.9%) can be used \u2013 never use glucose solution 2. Oral rehydration. sit the patient, supporting the arms on a table, at the beginning of the oral rehydration. this keeps the patient alert and improves the oral tolerance. oral rehydration therapy is considered the treatment of choice in cases of failure of ORT. it has to be reserved for patients with severe dehydration or who eliminate more than 10\u201320 mL/kg/hour. in the 1960s, efforts by young scientists led to the development of ORT for the treatment of dehydration that often accompanies acute attacks of diarrhea. the use of ORS to rehydrate children is safe and there are no significant differences in incidences of hyponatremia, hypernatremia, mean duration of diarrhea, weight gain, or total fluid intake if compared with IVT. the main reason for this failure is that ORS neither reduces the frequency of bowel movements and fluid loss nor shortens the duration of illness. initial oral rehydration is 50\u2013100 mL/kg in the first 4 hours. also consider giving the ORS via a nasogastric tube if patients are unable to drink it or if they vomit persistently. glucose mmol/L Na mEq/L K mEq/L Cl mEq/L HCO3/citrate mEq/L mOsm/L Kcal/L Aroma Probiotics WHO (1984/2002) 110/75 90/75 20 80 30/8\u201312 311/245 80 No No ESPGHAN (1989/1997) 74\u2013111 60 20 >25 20 200\u2013250 52\u201380 No No Dicodral forte antisecretory drug is a peripherally acting enkephalinase inhibitor. it reduces intestinal water and electrolyte hypersecretion acting on the enkephalins. the action of racecadotril takes place only when there is a hypersecretion and has no effect on the activity secretory baseline. a recent individual patient data meta-analysis129 assessed the efficacy of the use of racecadotril as an adjunct to ORS compared with ORS alone or with placebo. the results of this recent meta-analysis support the use of racecadotril as an adjunct to ORS for the management of AGE in children. despite racecadotril\u2019s proven safety and efficacy in treating acute watery diarrhea, its cost-effectiveness for infants and children has not yet been determined in Europe. the UK model highlights the potential savings arising from reduction in diarrhea duration and avoidance of reconsultation and referral rates in children with diarrhea. the proportion of patients with cessation of vomiting in 24 hours was 58% with intravenous ondansetron, 17% placebo, and 33% in the metoclopramide group (P = 0.039) this case, the authors\u2019 conclusions were that oral ondansetron increased the proportion of patients who had ceased vomiting and reduced the number needing intravenous rehydration. the WHO has recommended zinc supplementation in children with gastroenteritis. supplementation should be started at the beginning of the symptoms. probiotic strains are of interest as they elicit health-promoting properties to the host. they release various soluble low-molecular-weight molecules of different nature. they can interact with corresponding cell receptors, support stability of host genome and microbiome. antibacterial therapy should be restricted to specific bacterial pathogens. infections with Shigella spp and Vibrio cholera should usually be treated with antibacterials. antibacterials are only used in severe unresponsive infections with Salmonella, Yersinia, Aeromonas, Campylobacter, Plesiomonas spp, and Clostridium difficile. therapy should be initiated only if diarrhea persists after suspension of antibiotic therapy Escherichia coli \u2013 Cephalosporins III (ceftriaxone 50 mg/kg IV every 24 hours) the use of antibiotics increases the risk of hemolytic uremic syndrome Helicobacter pylori. therapy prolongs the carrier state; however, recommended under 3 months of age for the high incidence of bacteremia. treatment reduces duration of illness, but does not prevent complications Vibrio cholerae \u2013 Cephalosporins III (ceftriaxone 50 mg/kg IV every 24 hours) aeromonas spp produce a -lactamase that induces resistance to penicillin and first-generation cephalosporins. low rates of resistance has been found to third generation cephalosporin (cefotaxime), to ciprofloxacin and to chloramphenicol. antibiotics are initiated in cases of febrile diarrheas, especially those believed to have moderate to severe disease. metronidazole is the drug of choice, with efficacy similar to vancomycin. in adults, recurrence is less frequent with fidaxomicin than with vancomycin. ciprofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim are not appropriate for treatment of O157:H7. azithromycin significantly reduced Shiga toxin levels, even when relatively high levels of O157:H7 were recovered. many reports on non-O157 STEC have been documented worldwide. the probiotic Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917 (EcN) seemed to have very efficient antagonistic activity on the EHEC strains of serotype O104:H4 and O157:H7, with reduced growth of pathogens. the acquisition of mechanisms mediating increased antibiotic resistance hampered patient treatment and recovery. treatment regimens include proton-pump inhibitor (lansoprazole, omeprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole, dexlansoprazole, or esomeprazole) and two antibiotics to reduce the risk of treatment failure and antibiotic resistance. antibacterials are used only in cases of severe and unresponsive infections. most effective are ciprofloxacin and azythromycin, and partially trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. antibiotics are initiated in cases of febrile diarrhea, especially in case of moderate to severe disease. different antibiotics have been effective against isolates of Shigella dysentery in different parts of the world. ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, nalidixic acid, fluoroquinolones like ciprofloxacin, pivmecillinam, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin. limited data suggest fluoroquinolones would be more effective than a beta-lactam (ampicillin) in reducing diarrhea among adults yersinia enterocolitica usually shows in vitro susceptibility to aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol, doxycycline, cotrimoxazole, third-generation cephalosporins, carabapenems, and fluoroquinolones. most common clinical manifestation of a cholera infection is a self-limited gastroenteritis that resolved spontaneously within 2 weeks. echinocandines \u2013 anidulafungin, caspofungin, and micafungin, recently introduced \u2013 seem to have some advantages over fluconazole and amphotericin B. the most appropriate dose in children weighing less than 40 kg is 2 mg/kg/day in the treatment of invasive candidiasis and or gastroenteritis. ia and Entamoeba histolytica amebiasis are the fourth-leading cause of death. nitazoxanide is not effective without an appropriate immune response. nitazoxanide is not effective without an appropriate immune response. helminths nematodes Strongyloides stercoralis and Trichuris trichiura are causes of diarrhea. strongyloides stercoralis can penetrate host skin and parasitize human intestines, leading to burning pain, tissue damage, ulcers, edema and obstruction of the intestinal tract, and diarrhea. antibacterials are only used in severe unresponsive infections with Salmonella, Yersinia, Aeromonas, Campylobacter, Plesiomonas spp, and Clostridium difficile. there is no evidence of benefit for antibiotics in nontyphoidal Salmonella diarrhea in otherwise healthy people. therapy should be initiated only if diarrhea persists after a suspension of antibiotic therapy Escherichia coli \u2013 Cephalosporins III (ceftriaxone 50 mg/kg IV every 24 hours) the use of antibiotics increases the risk of hemolytic uremic syndrome Helicobacter pylori. therapy prolongs the carrier state; however, recommended under 3 months of age for the high incidence of bacteremia. treatment reduces duration of illness, but does not prevent complications Vibrio cholerae \u2013 Cephalosporins III (ceftriaxone 50 mg/kg IV every 24 hours) ciprofloxacin and other quinolone class antimicrobials may be considered as potential drugs for the treatment of bacterial diarrhea caused by A. hydrophila. antibiotics are initiated in cases of febrile diarrheas, especially those believed to have moderate to severe disease. enteropathogens are generally susceptible to meropenem and ceftriaxone, followed by amikacin and ciprofloxacin. infection is primarily a disease of infants younger than 2 years of age, often contracted during travel in hot countries. ciprofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim are not appropriate for treatment of O157:H7. azithromycin significantly reduced Shiga toxin levels, even when relatively high levels of O157:H7 were recovered. numerous outbreaks, as well as sporadic cases of HUS, have been documented worldwide. the probiotic Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917 (EcN) seemed to have very efficient antagonistic activity on the EHEC strains of serotype O104:H4 and O157:H7, with reduced growth of pathogens. the 2011 outbreak strains perfectly showed the genome plasticity and evolution of E. coli as a result of horizontal gene transfer. prazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole, dexlansoprazole, or esomeprazole) are two antibiotics to reduce the risk of treatment failure and antibiotic resistance. the eradication of this infection stops the activity of the inflammatory process but also restores the mucous membranes. antibiotics are initiated in cases of febrile diarrhea, especially in case of moderate to severe disease. antibiotic treatment (ampicillin, amoxicillin, cefixime, azithromycin, cotrimoxazole) did not shorten the duration of diarrhea. fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin) would be more effective than a beta-lactam (ampicillin) in reducing diarrhea among adults. beta-lactams would be more effective than fluoroquinolones in reducing diarrhea among adults. emerging drug resistance to ciprofloxacin and second-line drugs such as pivmecillinam, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin is increasingly being reported in many parts of the world. yersinia enterocolitica usually shows in vitro susceptibility to aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol, doxycycline, cotrimoxazole, third-generation cephalosporins, carabapenems, and fluoroquinolones. most common clinical manifestation of a Yersinia enterocolitica infection is a self-limited gastroenteritis that resolved spontaneously within 2 weeks. the most appropriate dose in children weighing less than 40 kg is 2 mg/kg/day in the treatment of invasive candidiasis and or gastroenteritis. the most appropriate dose in children weighing less than 40 kg is 2 mg/kg/day in the treatment of invasive candidiasis and/or gastroenteritis. nitazoxanide is not effective without an appropriate immune response. it significantly shortens the duration of diarrhea and decreases mortality in malnourished children. strongyloides stercoralis can penetrate host skin and parasitize human intestines, leading to burning pain, tissue damage, ulcers, edema and obstruction of the intestinal tract, and diarrhea. albendazole is the second-choice therapy. children are especially vulnerable to infection due to their high exposure risk. an estimated 2.5 million gastroenteritis deaths occur each year in children less than 5 years of age. most cases of AGE in children are viral, self-limited, and need only supportive treatment. intestinal infections often require drugs such as antiemetics. 5%\u20138% of infected individuals will develop HUS following STEC infection with E. coli O157:H7 the most commonly involved serotype, antibiotics should be prescribed according to more recent guidelines."}
