{"summary": "antibiotics for growth promotion in farm animals have been used for several decades. it is widely believed that use of antibiotics as growth promoters promotes evolution and/or selection of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms in farm animals. plant compounds have received considerable attention and probably are the most studied compounds especially for farm ruminants. the molecular weights of HT range from 500 to 3,000 Da (Haslam, 1989). they are susceptible to hydrolysis by acids, bases or esterases. they can be easily degraded and absorbed in the digestive tract. tannins are widely distributed in plant kingdom, especially abundant in nutritionally important forages, shrubs, cereals and medicinal herbs. condensed tannins are the most common type of tannin in forage legumes, trees and shrubs while HT is often present in leaves of trees and browse shrubs in tropical areas. tannins are more abundant in vulnerable parts of the plants, e.g., new leaves and flowers. tannins have long been recognized and the toxicity of tannins to bacteria, fungi and yeasts has been reviewed. mechanisms proposed so far to explain tannin antimicrobial activity include inhibition of extracellular microbial enzymes, deprivation of the substrates required for microbial growth, direct action on microbial metabolism through inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation. evidences have shown that the microbial cell membrane is the primary site of inhibitory action by tannins through cell aggregation and disruption only CT isolated from purple prairie clover (Dalea purpurea Vent) and PT from brown alga (Ascophyllum nodosum) possessed strong anti-E. coli and anti-E. coli O157:H7 activity. Phlorotannins also have greater antimicrobial activity than CT and HT. sed tannins of purple prairie clover (Dalea purpurea Vent.) incubated for 24 h with (C) 0 or 50 g/mL of (D) phlorotannins, (E) hydrolyzable tannins or (F) condensed tannins. four tropical tanniniferous plant extracts have shown anthelmintic effect on Haemonchus contortus and T. colubriformis. tannins extract from quebracho (Athanasiadou et al., 2001), chicory (Molan et al., 2003) and green tea (Molan et al., 2004) significantly inhibited the larval migration in a dose dependent manner. these results suggest anti-parasitic effect of tannins occurred throughout different stages of life-cycle of parasite. the antioxidant property of tannins has wide application in food industry and medical field to prevent oxidative stress related diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer or osteoporosis. it has been shown that CT and HT of relatively high molecular weight exhibited greater antioxidant activities than simple phenolics. quebracho tannins were not degraded or absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. but increased the antioxidant capacity of liver and plasma in sheep. tannins-protein complexation has been shown to reduce but not eliminate the antioxidant activities of tannins. hydrolyzable tannins from myricaria bracteata showed a significant anti-inflammatory effect on croton oil-induced ear edema in mice and on collagen-induced arthritis in DBA/1 mice. the authors speculate that the mechanism of anti-inflammatory effects was related to the potent ability for scavenging free radicals rather than inhibitory effects of HT on NO and pro-inflammatory cytokines production. tannin exerted inhibitory effect on HIV-1 through inhibiting HIV-1 replication by targeting the virus reverse transcriptase (Tan et al., 1991), protease (Xu et al., 2000), and integrase (Au et al., 2001), or inhibiting HIV-1 entry into target cells by interfering with the gp41 sex-helix bundle formation. tannic acid (HT) inhibited hepatitis tannins possess varying anti-virus activities depending on chemical compositions and structures. inhibition of virus adsorption to cells, inhibition of virus penetration into cell nucleus and inhibition of virus reverse transcriptases may be some of the underlying mechanisms. tannins particularly CT isolated from several plants have been shown to possess strong activity against Gram-negative bacteria. it is worth noting that pathogenic bacteria such as Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella, Shigella, Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas and Helicobacter pylori all sensitive to tannins. eptococcus, Clostridium, Proteus and Staphylococcus species were greater than catechin with a dihydroxy B ring. the toxicities of epi-catechin gallate and epigallocatechin gallate were greater than those of their ungallated counterparts-epicatechin and epigallocatechin. screening and identification of tannins that are effective and specific to target microbes would continuously be a research endeavor. sulla (Hedysarum coronarium) reduced the proportion of Trichostrongylus colubriformis hatched eggs and inhibited egg development of lungworm and gastrointestinal nematodes. four tropical tanniniferous plant extracts have shown anthelmintic effect on Haemonchus contortus and T. colubriformis. these results suggest anti-parasitic effects occurred throughout different stages of life-cycle of parasite. tion of nematodes eggs by adult worms, and 3) reducing development of eggs to larvae. anthelmintic effects vary greatly depending on chemical composition and structure of tannins. phenolic compounds have long been recognized as effective antioxidants. s as natural antioxidants is due to their complex combinations of reducing and redox activities. tannins-protein complexation has been shown to reduce but not eliminate the antioxidant activities of tannins. anti-inflammatory properties Tannins possess varying anti-inflammatory activities. tannins from grape-seed lowered low-grade inflammatory disease such as obesity by modulating cytokine expression. tannin exerted inhibitory effect on HIV-1 through inhibiting HIV-1 replication by targeting the virus reverse transcriptase (Tan et al., 1991), protease (Xu et al., 2000), and integrase (Au et al., 2001) tannic acid (HT) inhibited HCV entry and cell-to-cell transmission. tannins from persimmon (Diospyros kaki) significantly reduced viral infectivity of 12 tested viruses. tannins derived from green tea, acacia and gallnuts were effective only for some of them. the effects of CT on ruminant nutrition, health and production have been extensively studied and reviewed. it is generally believed that CT in temperate forage in low to medium concentration benefit ruminants in terms of improving protein utilization without negatively affecting feed intake and nutrient digestion. in the rumen, increase the amount of dietary protein reaching small intestine for absorption. CT would impede feed intake due to their astringent nature. at high concentration, however, CT would impede feed intake due to their astringent nature. the condition is characterized by an accumulation of gas in the rumen and reticulum that can impair both digestive and respiratory function. many factors can contribute to the bloat but the rapid lyses of plant cells and release of proteins from plant cells upon their entry into the rumen increasing the viscosity of the rumen fluid is a major contributing factor to pasture bloat. tannins-containing forage are regarded as \u201cbloat free\u201d dietary concentration below 20 g/kg DM of tannins is ineffective in controlling intestinal parasites in ruminant. sheep could detect the presence of internal parasites or associated symptoms. supplementation of A. nodosum meal at the dietary concentrations of 10 to 20 g/kg DM significantly decreased E. coli O157:H7 fecal shedding in cattle. dietary tannins could be a practical method to effectively decrease the presence of E. coli O157:H7 in ruminant digestive tract. E. coli O157:H7 challenged cattle Barley based concentrate diet 10 or 20 g/kg diet, up to 14 days Reduced fecal shedding of E. coli O157:H7 Bach et al. (2008) Purple prairie clover Condensed tannins (CT) the mechanisms of growth-promoting effects of tannins in monogastric animal are much less understood compared with those in ruminants. some reports indicated that low concentrations of tannins increased feed intake and thus increased performance of monogastric animals. tukelj et al. (2010) Chestnut HT Pigs (22 to 127 d) 0.19% HT + 0.16% of 5 acids Increased growth performance; increased lactic acid bacteria; lowered intestinal E. coli Brus et al. (2013) Chestnut HT Pigs (11 to 50 kg) 0.71% and 1.5% No effect on feed intake, body weight gain and carcass traits; reduced feed efficiency; reduced salivary and bulbourethral gland size effect on egg weights, cell thickness or yolk color; reduced cholesterol content; increased monounsaturated fatty acid Antongiovanni et al. (2014) Grape seed extract CT and other phenolic compounds Broiler chicken 0.72% Decreased weight gain; increased Lactobacillus, Enterococcus and decreased the counts of Clostridium in the ileal content. grape pomace CT and other phenolic compounds Broiler chickens 6% No effect on growth performance; increased Lactobacillus, Enterococcus and decreased the counts of Clostridium in the ileal content. Tannic acid HT pigs 125, 250, 500 and 1,000 mg/kg Reduced daily average daily gain, feed efficiency and faecal coliform count Lee et al. (2010) Tannic acid HT pigs 125 mg/kg No effect on growth performance; negatively affected blood hematology and plasma Fe status when diets are inadequate in Fe; reduced total anaerobic bacteria, Clostridium spp. and coliforms. 0.05% on growth and feed efficiency; reduced growth at 0.1%; no effect on carcass quality; reduced E. coli and coliform bacteria in small intestine Jamroz et al. chestnut HT increased feed efficiency, tended to increase viable counts of Lactobacilli in the jejunum and reduced caecal concentrations of ammonia, iso-butyric, and iso-valeric acid. but increased concentration from 0.71% to 1.5% reduced feed efficiency. coli and coliform bacteria in the small intestines of 28-d-old chickens were also reduced at the tannin levels of 0.5% to 0.1%. addition of 0.07% and 0.2% of the same tannin product did not affect broiler growth performance or the organic matter, crude protein, crude ash, calcium and phosphorus balance and utilization. ace contain significant amount of polyphenolic compounds including CT. added 1% of grape seed extract to pig diets increased abundances of Lachnospiraceae, Clostridales, Lactobacillus and Ruminococcaceae in fecal microbiome. tannic acid is a HT from varying plants including tara pods (Caesalpinia spinosa), gallnuts from Rhus semialata, Quercus infectoria or Sicilian Sumac leaves (Rhus coriaria) pigs were fed Fe deficient diets but fed 0.0125% of tannic acid. tannic acid at the dietary concentrations of 0.5% increased growth performance and fat content in breast and thigh meat, but reduced blood glucose concentration and cholesterol content in the liver of broiler chickens. increased concentrations to 2.5% and 3.0% reduced weight gain and protein efficiency and impaired the immune function of growing chickens by decreasing weight of bursa of fabricius, thymus and spleen. s fed tannin supplemented diets also reduced ileal digestibilities of energy, protein and amino acids. however, no negative effect was observed on pancreatic and jejunal enzymes activities. increased concentration from 0.71% to 1.5% reduced feed efficiency. tukelj et al. (2010) reported that chestnut HT at the level of 0.15% in combination with 0.15% of a mixture of acids had no effects on health status or growth performance of pigs. tosi et al. (2013) reported that chestnut HT at the dietary concentrations of 0.71% and 1.5% reduced Clostridium perfringens in the gut of broiler chicken orally challenged with these coccidia. supplementations of chestnut HT at levels of 0.45% and 0.5% also have been shown to increase live weight gain and feed intake of rabbits. 1% of grape seed extract increased abundances of Lachnospiraceae, Clostridales, Lactobacillus and Ruminococcaceae in fecal microbiome. oligomers (dimer\u2013pentamer) of grape tannin were only partially metabolized by the gut microbiota, producing phenolic metabolites that are known to be more readily absorbed. Tannic acid is a HT from varying plants including tara pods (Caesalpinia spinosa), gallnuts from Rhus semialata, Quercus infectoria or Sicilian Sumac leaves (Rhus coriaria) tannic acid at the dietary levels of 0.3% negatively impacted growth performance, hematological indices and plasma iron status of pigs. tannic acid at dietary concentrations of 0.75% and 1.5% did not alter salmonella cecal culture-positive chicks or the numbers of Salmonella typhimurium in the cecal contents of broiler chickens. increased concentrations to 2.5% and 3.0% reduced weight gain and protein efficiency and impaired the immune function of growing chickens by decreasing weight of bursa of fabricius, thymus and spleen. supplementing acorn (Quercus pubescens Willd.) HT at the dietary level of 0.516 tannic acid equivalent/kg diets did not affect feed intake or gastric mucosa but improved feed efficiency. addition of 10% quebracho CT extract increased body weight gain of challenged birds, increased crypt:villi ratio of the intestine and decreased oocyst excretion. antimicrobial resistance may not be the case in prolonged use of the isolated single plant-based antimicrobial compound. a good example is antimalarial compound artemisinin in traditional Chinese medicinal plant Qinghao."}
