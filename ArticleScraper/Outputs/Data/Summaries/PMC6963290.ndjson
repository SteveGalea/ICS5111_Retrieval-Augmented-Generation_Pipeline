{"summary": "rabbit caliciviruses Lagovirus europaeus GI.1 and Lagovirus europaeus GI.2 are characterized by severe necrotizing hepatitis and disseminated intravascular coagulation in the liver, spleen, kidney and other solid organs. rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHDV) is a highly contagious and often lethal infection in rabbits. ORF1 encodes a polyprotein that is cleaved by the viral protease into seven nonstructural proteins (NSP1-7) and a major structural capsid protein VP60 (presently VP1) at its C-terminus. Vaccination is the main approach for controlling RHDV because no effective treatment is available for this disease. oral vaccines using L. casei as a delivery system for pathogenic antigens have garnered much interest in vaccine development [27,28,29] there is increasing interest in the development of L. casei oral vaccines. this approach is significant for the effective induction of a mucosal immune response. lactobacillus casei was cultured in de Man, Rogosa and Sharp (MRS) broth at 37 \u00b0C without shaking under anaerobic conditions. pPG-T7g10-PPT, constructed in our previous study, encoded resistance to chloramphenicol (Cm) pMD18-T simple-eGFP and pMD18-T simple-VP60 were constructed in our previous study. recombinant plasmid pPG-T7g10-eGFP-VP60 (Cm+) was disrupted by MunI and NcoI. recombinant plasmid pPG-T7g10-eGFP-VP60 (Cm+) was obtained via blunt end ligation. recombinant plasmid pPG-t7g10-eGFP-VP60 was obtained via blunt end ligation the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred onto PVDF membranes. the immunoblot was then incubated with the following primary antibodies. recombinant L. casei was cultured overnight in MRS at 37 \u00b0C. recombinant L. casei was cultured overnight in MRS medium, washed with PBS, then resuspended in PBS at a final concentration of 1 1010 CFU/mL. the rabbits were immunized orally once a day for three consecutive days and boosted twice at 2-week intervals. three groups of rabbits (n = 6), immunized with pPG-eGFP-VP60/LC393, were challenged with 1 mL RHDV crude liver extract (at a viral RNA copy number of 1.0 105.79) administered via intramuscular injection into the leg at 37 d after the first vaccination (Figure 2). tissue samples were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin. sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) morphology was evaluated using light microscopy. pPG-T7g10-PPT was used as a constitutive expression plasmid in this study. it encoded resistance to chloramphenicol (Cm) and contained an HCE promoter, T7g10 enhancer, PgsA anchor, and the rrnBT1T2 terminator. pMD18-T simple-eGFP and pMD18-T simple-VP60 were constructed in our laboratory. d pPG-T7g10-eGFP-VP60 was obtained via blunt end ligation. recombinant plasmid pPG-t7g10-eGFP-VP60 was cleaved with SacI and ApaI. eGFP-VP60 fragment, cleaved with SacI and KpnI, was inserted into constitutive expression vector pMD18-T simple-VP60 digested by SacI immunoblot was incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies (at the dilution of 1:5000) at 4 \u00b0C for 30 min. protein expression was visualized using a chemiluminescent substrate reagent (thermo Scientific, Durham, NC, USA) recombinant L. casei was cultured overnight in MRS medium, washed with PBS, then resuspended in PBS at a final concentration of 1 1010 CFU/mL. the rabbits were randomly separated into three groups, with six rabbits per group. the first group was injected with a single do of a commercial inactivated RHDV vaccine. all rabbits were humanely euthanized and dissected at 10 days post-infection. ELISA Immunoassay The levels of anti-VP60(VP1)-specific IgG in the sera and those of SigA in the feces, genital tract secretions and intestinal mucusa were determined via ELISA. recombinant L. casei pPG-eGFP-VP60/LC393 grew normally on MRS medium without chloramphenicol, but did not grow on MRS medium containing chloramphenicol. morphology was evaluated using light microscopy. recombinant L. casei pPG-eGFP-VP60/LC393 was serially inoculated 40 times. plasmid was then extracted and inherited stability was assessed. recombinant L. casei showed good inherited stability and no gene deletion. cell lysates were analyzed by western blotting using anti-eGFP monoclonal antibody and rabbit anti-VP60(VP1) polyclonal antibody. specific immunoreactive bands of the expected size were observed in recombinant L. casei. the relevant immunoreactive bands were detected in cell pellets of strain pPG-eGFP-VP60/LC393 (lane 1), but not those of strains pPG/LC393 (lane 2) or LC393 (lane 3). the fluorescence of eGFP was observed by confocal microscopy directly (top), identification of VP60 by an anti-VP60(VP1) antibody. mucosal SigA levels increased significantly in the feces (Figure 6a), vagina (Figure 6b), nasal cavity (Figure 6c) and tears (Figure 6d) of the group orally immunized with pPG-eGFP-VP60/LC393 compared with those of the PBS-treated control group (p 0.01) the level of SigA induced by oral immunization with pPG-eGFP-VP60/LC393 was three groups of rabbits administered pPG-eGFP-VP60/LC393, inactivated vaccine, or PBS were infected with 1 mL RHDV at 7 days after the last booster. all rabbits in the PBS group died within three days post-challenge. the rabbits were completely protected against challenge with RHDV. there are almost no differences between the pPG-eGFP-VP60/LC393-immunized group and inactivated vaccine-immunized group. the tissues were obtained from the groups administered L. casei pPG-eGFP-VP60/LC393, inactivated vaccine, or PBS at 10 days post-challenge. recombinant L. casei pPG-eGFP-VP60/LC393 was serially inoculated 40 times. plasmid was then extracted, and inherited stability was assessed. recombinant L. casei showed good inherited stability and no gene deletion. 3 cells were cultured in MRS broth without chloramphenicol antibiotic. cell lysates were analyzed by western blotting using mouse anti-eGFP monoclonal antibody and rabbit anti-VP60(VP1) polyclonal antibody. the relevant immunoreactive bands were detected in cell pellets of strain pPG-eGFP-VP60/LC393 (lane 1), but not those of strains pPG/LC393 (lane 2) or LC393 (lane 3). the fluorescence of eGFP was observed by confocal microscopy directly (top), identification of VP60 by IFA assay using an anti-VP60(VP1) antibody. mucosal SigA levels increased significantly in the feces (Figure 6a), vagina (Figure 6b), nasal cavity (Figure 6c) and tears (Figure 6d) of the group orally immunized with pPG-eGFP-VP60/LC393 compared with those of the PBS-treated control group (p 0.01) the level of SigA induced by oral immunization with pPG-eGFP-VP60/LC393 was a vs. c, b vs. c indicate significant differences (p 0.01) at the same time point. all rabbits in the PBS group died within three days post-challenge. the rabbits were completely protected against challenge with RHDV. splenic sinus was congested, intestine villi were necrotic and severely desquamated. there are almost no differences between the pPG-eGFP-VP60/LC393-immunized group and inactivated vaccine-immunized group. recombinant engineered vaccines containing VP60(VP1) have been developed using bacteria, yeasts, plants, poxvirus-based vectors as delivery vectors. but intramuscular injection, which is the main route of administering these recombinant engineered vaccines, requires trained personnel. LC393 was selected as a vector in the genetically engineered L. casei oral vaccine. the main disadvantage of traditional plasmid expression systems is using antibiotic resistance genes as selective markers for genetically engineered bacteria. using antibiotic resistance genes in practice can impact biosafety, contribute to antibiotic resistance, and present potential hazards to health and the environment [55]. the multiple immunization procedure of recombinant Lactobacillus was employed in this study was due to the amounts of recombinant Lactobacillus adhered to the intestinal mucosa were decreased with the time. the rabbits were immunized with inactivated vaccine according to the instruction. rabbits vaccinated with recombinant L. casei pPG-eGFP-VP60/LC393 successfully induced a sufficient immune response to protect rabbits against infection with RHDV. pPG-eGFP-VP60/LC393 administered via oral immunization effectively induced a sufficient immune response to protect rabbits against infection. this finding indicates that L. casei protected the intestinal environment against the effects of RHDV. we developed an anti-RHDV vaccine using L. casei to deliver the VP60(VP1) antigen."}
