{"summary": "the human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) was the most common causative pathogen of CRV-LRDs at 100 days. the 30-day overall mortality rates due to influenza-LRDs, respiratory syncytial virus-LRDs, HPIV-LRDs, and human rhinovirus-LRDs were 35.7, 25.8, 31.6, and 42.8%, respectively. more than 50000 individuals receive hematopoietic stem cell transplantations (SCTs) worldwide. CRVs are common causes of both upper respiratory tract disease (URD) and lower respiratory tract disease (LRD) in this population. clinical information, including demographics, comorbidities, coinfections, and mortality were investigated. endpoint of the study was set as January 31, 2012, or the time of death or loss to follow up. hospital-acquired infection was defined as symptom onset 3 or more days after hospital admission. presence of co-pathogens defined as isolation of pathogenic bacterial species, fungal species, or other opportunistic viruses. high-dose corticosteroid use was defined as 1 mg/kg/day of prednisone and its equivalent dose of corticosteroids. the grade of immunodeficiency was classified into three groups, including severe, moderate, and mild immunodeficiency. all variables with a p0.05 upon univariate analysis were included in a multivariate logistic regression analysis. all variables with a p0.05 upon univariate analysis were included in a multivariate logistic regression analysis. p values were two-tailed, and statistical significance was set at p0.05. respiratory virus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) multiplex panel was used to test for influenza A and B viruses, RSV, HMPV, HPIV, HRhV, and HAdV. influenza-specific reverse transcription PCR was used to detect the influenza A (H1N1) during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Mortality due to CRVs was defined as death resulting from respiratory failure. mortality was defined as death from any cause within 30 days following diagnosis of CRV-LRD. an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) of 200 cells/mm3 blood within the 2 weeks preceding a CRV infection diagnosis was defined as lymphopenia. patients who met only one criterion of MID were regarded as having a mild immunodeficiency state. patients who met only one criterion of MID were regarded as having a mild immunodeficiency state. the baseline characteristics of the 67 SCT recipients with CRV-LRDs are shown in Table 1. During the winter, RSV and influenza A virus were the predominant CRVs, while the proportion of HPIV infection increased through spring and summer. multiple myeloma 13 (19.4) Myelodysplastic syndrome 9 (13.4) Non-hodgkin lymphoma 4 (6.0) Others* 6 (8.9) Transplantation type Autologous 17 (25.4) Allogeneic 50 (74.6) Matched, related 24 (35.8) Mismatched or unrelated 21 (31.3) Familial mismatched 5 (7.5) Stem cell source Peripheral blood 46 (68.7) Bone marrow 21 (31.3) Conditioning seven (50%) of 14 patients with influenza-LRDs received antiviral therapy within 48 hours following influenza-LRD diagnosis. one patient received combination therapy with peramivir (600 mg/day for 8 days) and oseltamivir (300 mg/day for 15 days) five (35.7%) patients experienced mechanical ventilation. n=7; 10.4%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=5; 7.4%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=4; 5.9%) only 2 patients died without pneumonia being the cause of death, one due to septic shock as a result of infectious colitis and one due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. mortality at 30 days 5 (35.7) 8 (25.8) 6 (31.6) 3 (42.9) 22 (30.9) mortality at day 30 after CRV-LRD diagnosis was 32.8% (22/67) high-dose steroid usage (p=0.025), SID (p=0.033) and lymphopenia (p=0.006) were independent risk factors for mortality within 30 days of CRV-LRD detection.

HPIV and RSV coinfection was observed in one patient. ignancy Acute myelogenous leukemia 25 (37.3) Multiple myeloma 13 (19.4) Myelodysplastic syndrome 9 (13.4) Non-hodgkin lymphoma 4 (6.0) Others* 6 (8.9) Transplantation type Autologous 17 (25.4) Allogeneic 50 (74.6) Matched, related 24 (35.8) Mismatched or unrelated 21 (31.3) Familial mismatched 5 (7.5) Stem cell source Peripher seven (50%) of 14 patients with influenza-LRDs received antiviral therapy within 48 hours following symptom onset. one patient received combination therapy with peramivir (600 mg/day for 8 days) and oseltamivir (300 mg/day for 15 days) five (35.7%) patients experienced mechanical ventilation. bacterial co-pathogen was Acinetobacter baumannii (n=7; 10.4%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=5; 7.4%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=4; 5.9%) only 2 patients died without pneumonia being the cause of death, one due to septic shock as a result of infectious colitis. viral therapy within 48 hrs after symptom onset 3 (21.4) 2 (6.5) 1 (5.3) - 6 (8.5) Hospitalization 12 (85.7) 26 (83.9) 17 (89.5) 6 (85.7) 61 (85.9) Mechanical ventilation 5 (35.7) 9 (29.0) 12 (63.2) 4 (57.1) 30 (42.3) overall mortality at 30 days 5 (35.7) 8 (25.8) 6 (31.6) 3 (42.9) 22 (30.9) Mortality due to CRV-LRD Characteristics Survived >30 days after CRV-LRD (n=45) Death 30 days after CRV LRD (n=22) Unvariate analysis (p value) Age (yrs)* 43 (13) 44 (13) 0.905 Male 28 (62.2) 15 (68.2) 0.633 BMI* 22.2 (3.55) 22.9 (3.96) 0.520 Obesity (BMI>25) 7 (15.6) 6 (27.3) 0.260 Donor type 0.7 D 320 (409) 204 (276) 0.128 Lymphopenia (ALC0.2109/L) 6 (13.3) 10 (45.5) 0.006 CRV, common respiratory virus; LRD, lower respiratory tract disease; BMI, body mass index; GVHD, graft-versus-host disease; SCT, stem cell transplantation; absolute lymphocyte count. the incidences of influenza-associated LRD among SCT recipients reported in other studies ranged from 0.4\u20134.1%. the mortality rates were 14.7\u201328%. the 30-day mortality rate of influenza-LRD at our center was 14.3%. independent predictors of HPIV-associated death have been reported in the literature. steroid usage, cancer status, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, LRD, infection immediately following SCT (30 days), mismatched donor, need for mechanical ventilation, and presence of co-pathogens. 0.7\u20131.2% of SCT recipients progressed to death. no cases of HAdV-LRDs or HMPV-LRDs were observed in our patient cohort. CRV infection may contribute to sustained inflammation or activation of an inflammatory process that leads to irreversible airway damage. there were no standardized guidelines for screening and treatment of CRV-LRDs. to overcome this limitation, only CRV-LRD cases were included. however, it was difficult to determine whether the fatal outcome was solely attributable to the CRV or due to a combination of the CRV and co-pathogens. influenza is the only CRV with an available vaccine. the annual seasonal influenza vaccination is recommended for all SCT recipients."}
