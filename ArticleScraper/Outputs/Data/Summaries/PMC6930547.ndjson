{"summary": "HSV-1 infection establishes life-long latency with reactivation triggered by stimuli like UV light, tissue damage, or compromised immunity. the severity of HSV-1 infection varies from mild symptoms to life-threatening encephalitis in humans. stable isotope-labeled amino acid culture (SILAC)-based quantitative proteomic analysis of HSV-1-infected HEK 293T cells was performed. RNAi-based functional analysis was employed to explore the role of several regulated host proteins in viral replication. host cell activates various antiviral responses to limit viral infection. HEK 293T cells are highly permissive to HSV-1 infection. their innate immune response during infection with a DNA virus is weak. this results in weak activation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and related biological processes. the total DNA was extracted, and the intracellular DNA level of the HSV-1 genome was measured with quantitative RT-PCR. three independent biological replicates were subjected to an MS analysis. glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and lamin B1 were used as markers of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins. a confidence score above 95% and a ratio >0 and 99 were considered as being quantified. 6607 host proteins were quantified, among which 5784 were from the cytoplasmic fraction and 3382 were from the nuclear fraction (nucleo). in the cytoplasmic fraction, 3225 quantified proteins were from 4 h p.i. and 3266 quantified proteins were from 20 h p.i. the SILAC-MS data indicated that IRF3 and IFITM3 were upregulated at 20 h p.i. in the cytoplasm, but upregulated at 20 h p.i. both the Western blots and SILAC-MS analysis did not detect IRF3 and IFITM3 in the nucleus. a quantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed on five regulated proteins. the intracellular mRNA level of CHCHD2 was downregulated at 20 h p.i. but hardly at 4 h p.i. TRIM27 was identified by the MS data as being downregulated. regulated proteins at 4 h p.i. in the cytoplasmic fraction were over-represented by the regulated proteins at 4 h p.i. in the nuclear fraction. the categories \u201csignal transduction\u201d, \u201cion trans-membrane transport\u201d, \u201cresponse to oxidative stress\u201d and \u201cresponse to oxidative stress\u201d were over-represented by the regulated proteins at 20 h p.i. in the nuclear fraction. a GO analysis based on biological processes indicated that these proteins were enriched in the following categories. these proteins were selected based on a comparison with our previous quantitative analysis of RNA virus-infected cells. the intracellular levels of HSV-1 DNA were significantly higher in cells transfected with siRNAs against IFITM3, CHCHD2 or TRIM27. the knockdown of IFITM3, CHCHD2 or TRIM27 also increased the HSV-1 titer. this implies that IFITM3, CHCHD2 and TRIM27 play positive roles in defending against HSV-1 infection. supernatants were collected and viral titers in the supernatants were measured. the cells transfected with scrambled siRNAs were indicated as NC. SILAC-based quantitative proteomic analysis of HEK 293T cells. mock- or HSV-1 (MOI = 5)-infected HEK 293T cells were harvested at 4 h p.i. and 20 h p.i. total RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed into the cDNA to quantify the intracellular mRNA level of IFNB1 and ISG56. the cells were then subcellularly fractionated into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions. the fractionated proteins were digested into peptides and further fractionated with strong cation exchange chromatography (SCX) for MS analysis. a total of 6607 host proteins were quantified. in the nuclear fraction, 3225 proteins were quantified at 4 h p.i. and 3266 proteins were quantified at 20 h p.i. in the nuclear fraction. the average values of the protein ratio from the three biological replicates were calculated and plotted on a volcano plot. proteins from the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of the mock- or HSV-1-infected (MOI = 5) HEK 293T cells were extracted for Western blot analysis. lamin B1 and GAPDH were used as internal controls for nuclear (nucleo) and cytoplasmic (cyto) proteins. differentially regulated proteins in both fractions were submitted to the database for annotation, visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) all the proteins quantified in all the fractions as the background. the over-represented categories suggest that these biological processes are more vulnerable under HSV-1 infection than other pathways. regulators identified at 4 h p.i. (A) or 20 h p.i. (C) in cytoplasmic (cyto) or regulated proteins identified at 4 h p.i. (B) or 20 h p.i. (D) in nuclear (nucleo) fractions were submitted to the database for annotation, visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) website for gene ontology (GO) analysis. HEK 293T cells were transfected with siRNAs against IFITM3, CHCHD2 and TRIM27. at 24 h post transfection, the total mRNA was extracted and transcribed into cDNA for quantitative RT-PCR analysis. all six pairs of siRNAs decreased gene expression significantly. HEK 293T cells were transfected with mock or siRNAs for selected genes, followed by a 24 h culture and then infected with HSV-1 at an MOI of 5. total DNA was harvested and the intracellular level of the HSV-1 DNA was measured with quantitative RT-PCR analysis. a total of 6607 host proteins were quantified, of which 498 proteins were differentially regulated. the significance of the NF-B pathway and the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system [19] on virus\u2013host interactions during HSV-1 infection have been reported repeatedly. the role of the coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix domain containing 2 (CHCHD2) during herpesvirus infection has not been reported yet. the role of the coiled-coil-helix domain containing 2 (CHCHD2) during herpesvirus infection has not been reported. HEK 293T cells were grown in a modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM, GIBCO, Grand Island, NE, USA) supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin (GIBCO) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, GIBCO) at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2. the HSV-1 strain 129 was used in this study, and virus was stocked at 80 \u00b0C. subcellular fractionation was performed with a nuclear and cytoplasmic protein extraction kit (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) the cell pellets were first washed three times with pre-chilled PBS and then resuspended in pre-chilled nuclear and cytoplasmic protein extraction kit buffer A. the pellet was then resuspended in nuclear and cytoplasmic protein extraction kit buffer A and incubated on ice for 15 min. a hybrid quadrupole-TOF LC/MS/MS mass spectrometer (TripleTOF 5600+, AB SCIEX) was coupled to a nanospray ion source. a 100 min gradient was established using mobile phase A (3% DMSO, 96.9% H2O, and 0.1% formic acid) protein ratio was calculated by weighted averaging ratios of its peptides, with peptide intensity as the weight. peptide quantitative information, as long as the peptide is unique to the protein, was also used as the quantitative information of the protein. protein ratios should be greater than the upregulated or lesser than downregulated cut-off values in at least two independent replicates. category B: proteins with ratios greater than the upregulated or lesser than downregulated cut-off values in at least two independent replicates. Western Blot Analysis Cell samples were lysed with a radio immunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer (Beyotime, China) and subjected to SDS-PAGE. proteins in the gel were transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore) and blocked with 5% non-fat milk in TBST buffer. SYBR Premix Ex TaqTM (Applied Biosystems) was used as the fluorescent dye on Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-Time PCR Systems. the primers used were synthesized by Sangon (Shanghai, China) and the sequences were as follows (5\u2019\u20133\u2019): HSV-1, Forward: CGGCTGTGACACTATCG, Reverse: CTCGTAAAATGGCCCCCCCCC; GAPDH, Forward: GAAGATGGTGA HEK 293T cells were grown in a SILAC medium containing 10% dialyzed FBS (Thermo) and l-arginine and l-lysine (R0K0, \u201clight\u201d), l-arginine-13C6 and l-lysine-4,4,5,5-d4 (L), or l-arginine-13C6, 15N4 and l-lysine-13C6, 15N2 (R10K8, mock-treated cells (light), HSV-1 infected cells harvested at 4 h p.i.
