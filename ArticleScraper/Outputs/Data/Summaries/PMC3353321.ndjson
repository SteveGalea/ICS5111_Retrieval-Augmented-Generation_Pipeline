{"summary": "a new coronavirus was the aetiological agent of SARS, the SARS-CoV. subsequently bats were the natural reservoir for several viruses closely related genetically to the SARS-CoV. at present, the presence of SARS-like CoVs in bats has been demonstrated in Asia, Africa, and Europe [4\u20139], showing the wide diffusion of these viruses. -time PCR assay is a method with a significantly lower limit of detection than conventional PCR, allowing to increase the sensitivity of diagnostic test. the developed real-time PCRs described by other authors have used primers designed on viral sequences found in local geographical areas. it is uncertain whether these assays are able to detect viruses from other areas, in light of the high genetic variability of the coronaviruses. the bats were caught using harp traps and placed individually into cotton bags before subsequent investigation started. the faeces were immediately collected when bats produced fresh bolus during handling. the samples were then conserved at 80\u00b0C before processing. cDNA was synthesised using random hexamers with the ImProm-II Reverse Transcription System (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA) the forward and reverse primers were designed on the basis of the 11FW and 13RV degenerate primers which amplified a fragment of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene (RdRp) sequences were modified on the basis of a multiple sequence alignment including 10 SARS-related coronavirus a 168 bp fragment located between the nt 15647\u201315814 (Coronavirus, SARS-CoV Tor2; NC_004718) was detected using 11FW-modified and 13RV-modified primers. a conventional PCR was carried out by Taq DNA Polymerase (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) using 11FW-modified and 13RV-modified primers. plasmid purification was carried out using the TOPO TA Cloning Kit. purity was assessed by a spectrophotometer using the 260/280 nm ratio. plasmid was linearised above the bat-SARS-like CoV fragment sequence. the SYBR Green real-time PCR was performed in a final volume of 25 L containing 12.5 L of SYBR Premix Ex Taq II, 0.4 M of forward (11FW-modified) and reverse (13RV-modified) primers and 2 L of template DNA. each run consisted of an initial incubation for activation of the hot-start DNA polymerase at 95\u00b0C for 30 sec followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 10 sec, the limit of detection (LOD) of the reaction was determined based on the highest dilution of plasmid possible to amplify with good reproducibility. five microliters of the amplicons were electrophoresed in 2% (w/v) agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide in 1x standard tris-acetate-EDTA buffer and visualised by ultravioltet (UV) light. the canine distemper virus CDV (Morbillivirus, Onderstepoort strain, NOBIVAC PUPPY CP, Nobivac, Boxmeer, The Netherlands, cDNA obtained from RNA extracted from vaccine suspension) and the feline panleukopenia virus FPV (Parvovirus, strain 1033/09, DNA extracted from tongue, [20] were tested as noncoronavirus RNA viruses. the interassay variability was tested on bat samples by testing the three samples with different viral concentrations (B1, B2, and B3) in triplicate on three different days (Table 2). Mean, standard deviation (SD), and coefficient of variation (CV) were calculated. the CV was calculated as the percentage of the ratio of standard deviation and the mean of the copies obtained. bat samples were considered positive if the mean of three replicates was greater than the LOD. five microliters of the amplicons were electrophoresed in 2% (w/v) agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide in 1x standard tris-acetate-EDTA buffer. massRuler Low-Range DNA Ladder was used to check the size of DNA fragments. bats were caught using harp traps and placed individually into cotton bags. species, sex, age category (juvenile, subadult, adult), forearm length, and weight were determined. faeces were immediately collected when bats produced fresh bolus during handling. alignment including 10 SARS-related coronavirus reference strains available from the GenBank database. reference sequences were aligned using ClustalW software implemented with BioEdit version 7.0.5. alignment includes 10 SARS-related coronavirus reference strains. 13RV-modified (5\u2032- TGT GAG CAA AAT TCG TGA GGT CC-3\u2032) primers, a 168 bp fragment located between the nt 15647\u201315814 (Coronavirus, SARS-CoV Tor2; NC_004718) was able to be detected. the template DNA to be inserted as a target sequence in the plasmid vector was produced by amplifying the cDNA obtained from sample 89 the linearised plasmid was visualised and quantified by electrophoresis on 1% (w/v) agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide in 1x standard TAE buffer. the copy number of standard plasmid DNA was calculated using the equation described by the US Environmental Protection Agency protocol [18]. each run consisted of an initial incubation for activation of the hot-start DNA polymerase at 95\u00b0C for 30 sec. 40 cycles of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 10 sec, annealing at 55\u00b0C for 20 sec, and polymerization at 72\u00b0C for 20 sec. specimens were considered positive if the fluorescence curve in the amplification plot showed an exponential increase, and a specific melting peak was observed. cDNA obtained from RNA extracted from faecal sample 893/09-11 was used as a standard to test the amplification of the bat-SARS-like CoV. coronaviruses of different genera tested were feline coronavirus FCoV and infectious bronchitis virus IBV. seven successive 10-fold dilutions (from 2 106 to 2 100 copies/L) of recombinant plasmid were tested in triplicate within the same run. the same was done for three samples with different viral concentrations (the highest viral concentration detected among the sampled bats) dilutions of recombinant plasmid: A1 (2 106), A2 (2 105), A3 (2 104), A4 (2 103), A5 (2 102), A6 (2 101), and A7 (2 100). dilutions of recombinant plasmid: A1 (2 106), A2 (2 105), A3 (2 104), A4 (2 103), A5 (2 102), A6 (2 101), and A7 (2 100 the linearity and efficiency of the SYBR Green real-time PCR were determined by generating a standard curve in which serial 10-fold dilutions of recombinant plasmid were tested. the standard curve was generated by plotting the real-time PCR threshold cycle numbers (Ct) of each dilution against the known copy numbers of recombinant plasmid. the resulting slope showed a linear relationship over 9 orders of magnitude, ranging from approximately 1 specific bands of approximately 168 bp were visualised for all replicates of recombinant plasmid dilutions. for recombinant plasmid dilution with a concentration of 1 101 copies/L only one specific amplicon to three replicates was visualised. coefficient of variation (CV) obtained ranged from 0.45 to 1.41 for plasmid concentrations higher than 102 copies/L. for bat samples, the CV obtained was 1.27 for the viral concentration of 102 copies/L and 7.56\u201313.68 for concentrations of 100 copies/L. the faeces sampled during the extraction procedure showed a single peak between 83\u00b0 and 84\u00b0C for each positive bat sample. the difference in the melting temperature between the standard plasmid (83.3\u00b0C, see above) and the faecal samples was a probable consequence of nucleotide mutations in the amplified target sequence. the real-time PCR products were checked on agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide in standard TAE buffer the standard curve was generated by plotting the real-time PCR threshold cycle numbers (Ct) of each dilution against the known copy numbers of recombinant plasmid. the resulting slope showed a linear relationship over 9 orders of magnitude, ranging from approximately 1 100 to 1 108 copies/L. the slope was 3.36 with a coefficient of determination (R 2) > 0.99 and a reaction efficiency (E) of 0.99, calculated from the slope (S) using E = a, b, c, d, and e: recombinant plasmid dilutions with concentrations of 1 101 copies/L. the developed assay was capable of detecting bat-SARS-like coV sample 893/09-11. the melting curve analysis of sample 893/09-11 showed a single peak at 83.3\u00b0C. for bat samples, the CV obtained was 1.27 for the viral concentration of 102 copies/L and 7.56\u201313.68 for concentrations of 100 copies/L (Table 2). the determination of the interassay variability tested on three bat samples gave a CV of 1,38 for the viral concentration of 102 copies/L and 23.97\u201328.79 for concentrations of 100 copies/L (Table 2). the real-time PCR products were checked on agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide in standard TAE buffer. all replicates of the detected positive samples showed a well-defined specific band of approximately 168 bp. in this figure is represented the 2% (w/v) agarose gel electrophoresis of five of the 11 positive samples detected in bats belonging to sampling area A (San Cesario sul Panaro, MO) the predominance of surveys on coronavirus infection in bats has used a reverse-transcribed PCR (RT-PCR) technique for the initial faecal sample screening. however, it is possible that there has been an underestimation of the real prevalence of infection in bats. this possible underestimation of the real prevalence of infection can affect the evaluation of the real epidemiologic impact of bats in viral ecology. nineteen of the 45 greater horseshoe bats sampled were positive with a 42% prevalence and viral quantities in positive samples ranged from orders of magnitude 100 to 102. the prevalence of SARS-like coronavirus infection resulted higher in Italian bats than in Bulgarian bats."}
