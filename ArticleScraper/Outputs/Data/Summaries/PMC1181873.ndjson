{"summary": "methods and Findings First, we use analytical methods to show that (i) ignoring the latent period or (ii) making the common assumption of exponentially distributed latent and infectious periods always results in underestimating the basic reproductive ratio of an infection. we then proceed to illustrate these points by fitting epidemic models to data from an influenza outbreak. the most commonly used framework for epidemiological systems is still the susceptible\u2013infectious\u2013recovered (SEIR) class of models. this assumption gives rise to exponentially distributed latent and infectious periods, which is epidemiologically unrealistic for most infections [18\u201320]. the probability density function of the infectious period, p(t), is just the negative derivative of the survivorship function, dP(t)/dt. different functional forms for p(t) give rise to alternative assumptions concerning the distribution of the infectious period in the model. estimates of latent and infectious period durations have received some attention over the past two decades. the precise distribution of the infectious period has no qualitative effects on the asymptotic values or properties of the system. changes in p(t) are known to have important consequences for the persistence likelihood of infections. we document systematic differences in the model parameters estimated from an epidemic using the exponential and gamma-distributed models. we demonstrate that the use of exponential models produces overoptimistic predictions about the low levels of control required to subdue an epidemic. a fraction q of those who had contact with an infectious and symptomatic individual (IS) are removed to the quarantined susceptible class, SQ, where they spend exactly Q days. the estimation of the basic reproductive ratio of the infection (R 0) measures the transmission potential of the infection, and determines the degree of control required. one approach is to fit model parameters to data by \u201ctrajectory matching\u201d where one looks for the combination of parameters that give rise to dynamics most consistent with observed patterns. relationship was first determined by Anderson and Watson [36] and has recently been applied in context of viral life cycle dynamics by Lloyd [33]. it reveals a subtle yet very important interaction between model structure and estimated R 0. In general, as the infectious period becomes more tightly distributed (increasing m), lower values of R 0 are estimated for any given growth rate. n = m = 1) may be substantially over- or underestimated using the classical exponentially distributed model (n = m = 1) compared to periods of fixed lengths (n = m), depending on whether an exposed class is included (solid lines) or not (dashed lines) the least squares error (LSE) (A) and R 0 (B) of the best-fit model differs. we plot the incidence data along with the SEIR best fit (m = 2, n = 2) and that obtained by ignoring any latent period (n = 1). the effective population size for the influenza outbreak was known to be N = 763. the initial rate of increase in incidence does well in estimating R 0 for the exponentially distributed SIR model but significantly less well for the gamma-distributed SEIR model. this also highlights that even when incorporating a latent period, estimates of R 0 may potentially underestimate the true value of R 0. management Consequences The results outlined above highlight the pitfalls of making a priori assumptions regarding the distributions of latent and infectious periods. an exponential (colored surface) or gamma (black grid surface; m = n = 10) distribution of the latent and infectious periods results in a reduction in the mean infectious period. this effect is not as pronounced in the gamma-distributed models because there is less variation in the infectious periods. if the average latent period is increased relative to the fixed quarantine period, then the control measures are predicted to be more effective for the gamma-distributed model. if the average latent period is increased relative to the fixed quarantine period, then the control measures are predicted to be more effective for the gamma-distributed model. models with an exponentially distributed infectious period will always overestimate the infection's basic reproductive ratio. when the latent period is included, however, this finding is reversed when the growth rate is large. ignoring the latent period or assuming exponential distributions will lead to an underestimate of R 0. we use data from an influenza outbreak in an English boarding school [37] to estimate model parameters by trajectory matching. in the absence of independent data, this method can be used to provide estimates of the key infectious parameters. we can also compare the parameter estimates to observed parameter ranges. the effective population size for the influenza outbreak was known to be N = 763. the SIR best-fit and SEIR best-fit models result in strikingly different estimates of R 0: 3.74 for the SIR model versus 35.9 for the SEIR model. however, the best-fit estimate of R 0 obtained from the gamma-distributed SEIR model is much more sensitive to the number of points used to obtain the fit. a priori assumption may give rise to gross over- or underestimates for the basic reproductive ratio of an infection. however, choice of model structure can also be very important when making recommendations regarding individual-level control strategies. both measures are crucially affected by whether the classic exponentially distributed model or a more realistic framework is used. gamma-distributed models are more effective when the infectious period is exponentially distributed. this effect is not as pronounced in the gamma-distributed models because there is less variation in the infectious periods. a longer delay in detecting infected individuals has fewer consequences for the exponentially distributed model. the large discrepancies between estimates of R 0 from the exponentially distributed and gamma-distributed fits reiterate the importance of accurately determining the precise distributions of latent and infectious periods. if the underlying structure of the model is inappropriate, the method of parameterization is largely irrelevant. latent and infectious periods had a particular pattern\u2014called exponential. both assumptions could potentially lead to underestimating the way the disease spreads. they then tested their predictions on a known outbreak of influenza that occurred in a school. the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the united states has a web site that explains its work on assessing infectious disease outbreaks. it is important to try to predict how the disease will behave, e.g., how infectious it is and what its latent period is, so that the spread of the disease can be estimated."}
