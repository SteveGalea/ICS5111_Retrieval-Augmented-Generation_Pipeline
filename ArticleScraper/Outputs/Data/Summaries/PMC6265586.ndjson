{"summary": "FMD viruses are a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus. they belong to the genus Aphthovirus, family Picornaviridae. the size of the virus genome is approximately 8.5 kb. antiviral agent interferon alpha (IFN-) was expressed using a recombinant adenovirus to verify its protective effect against FMDV in pigs. antiviral agents have emerged to complement the early immunity of vaccines or to replace vaccines when emergency inoculation is required. ribavirin was evaluated for its antiviral effect with a proper tool to overcome disadvantage on FMDV-infected cells and model animals. it was demonstrated that complementary treatment with ribavirin and vaccines are synergistically effective in sustaining survival rates and body weights. in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37\u00b0C, cells were treated for 3 h with MTS. absorbance was measured with a microplate reader at 490 nm. the 50% effective concentration (EC50) and 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) were calculated using GraphPad 5.0. a 3 mg/dose of ribavirin or 6-azauridine was injected IP twice per day from day 0 to day 3. six hours after the agent was first administered, the mice (n = 5 per group) were IP inoculated with 50 LD50 (50% lethal dose) DV, 5 108 TCID50 (50% tissue culture infective dose) of Ad-3siRNA or Ad-IFN was injected IM. ribavirin was IP or intramuscularly (IM) injected from day 0 to day 3. weight changes and survival rates of all mice were monitored for 10 days. six hours after first provision of reagents, 50 LD50 Asia1 Shamir were injected IP. weight changes and survival rates of the mice were monitored for 10 days. at days 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8, blood was collected, serum was prepared, and RNA was extracted to measure the amount of virus present. mice were inoculated with 50 LD50 Asia1 Shamir. changes in weight and survival rates were monitored for 15 days. copy number of viral RNA in serum for viremia assessment was also determined. mice were twice injected IP with 50 LD50 of Asia1/Shamir. survival rate of mice for 10 days and average weight of live mice for 10 days. negative control animals all died by day 3. pigs were administered ribavirin (1,800 mg/pig; the dosage was determined in a preliminary dose-dependent survival/efficacy test in the pigs. pigs were challenged with 105 TCID50 Asia1 Shamir by needle challenge to the heel-bulb. each clinical observation was given a score (maximum, 16 points) GraphPad Instat (ver. 3.05; GraphPad Software) and GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software) were used to statistically assess differences in survival rates and weight changes. t-test was also used for statistical significance analysis. 50 is the effective concentration where the cytopathic effect is 50% with the control value as the standard. the CC50 is the cytotoxicity concentration at which normal cells account for 50% of the total cells based on the control value. mice expressing three siRNAs against FMDV and Ad-IFN- were injected IP. at day 0, the challenge virus was injected IP. survival rates for all mice were monitored for 10 days. six hours after the agents were first provided, 50 LD50 Asia1 Shamir were injected IP in all groups (n = 5 per group) weight changes and survival rates of all mice were monitored for 10 days. ELISA kit for detection of FMDV structural protein antibodies was employed. responses to repeat challenge in mice treated with antiviral agents/vaccine. at day 0, trivalent vaccinations were administered, and 6 mg or 10 mg ribavirin absorbed in feed were provided from day 0 to day 6 to each mouse. mg ribavirin, or oil/gel adjuvant, or with/without commercial vaccine. mice were IP inoculated with 50 LD50 Asia1 Shamir. mice were injected intramuscular with 50 LD50 of Asia1/Shamir. arrows indicate the day of the second challenge (3 dpc) blood was collected, serum was separated, and RNA was extracted using the MagNaPure LC 96 System. real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was conducted to quantify the amount of FMDV. each clinical observation was given a score (maximum, 16 points) using the following criteria: lameness (1 point), vesicles in the hoof or foot (1 or 2 points for each affected hoof and foot) and vesicles in the snout, lips, or tongue (1 point for each affected area) ribavirin and azauridine had similar values but T1105 produced the lowest reaction by the cells. ribavirin, azauridine, T1105, and adenovirus, known to protect against RNA virus replication, could treat and protect against FMDVs. ribavirin was administered twice a day from day 0 to day 3. group treated with combined application of vaccines and antiviral agents administered vaccines and ribavirin. adult mice had a significantly high 100% survival rate (p 0.0001) the weight change rate for each day was less than 5%. uvants and/or vaccine ISA 201 or gel (Rehydragel HPA) used as an adjuvant was concomitantly administered with ribavirin. when the vaccine alone was given, there was no significant difference in survival from the negative control. when ribavirin was concomitantly inoculated with adjuvants or adjuvants and vaccines, there were significant differences in survival compared to the control group. ribavirin with oil and commercial vaccine did not exhibit clinical signs during all experimental days. negative control was found to have high RNA copy numbers of viremia. cellular toxicity and virus growth inhibition by the different antiviral agents were measured in IBRS-2 cells. inoculation was more effective in the protection against FMDVs than IM inoculation. when 15 mg of ribavirin was orally administered in the feed, the survival rate of the mice was 100% for 10 days. when ribavirin was orally administered, there were less than 10% weight changes in the mice. at day 10, the adult mice were challenged with the same concentration of FMDV. survival rates and weights of the mice did not change or they showed a decreased then increased pattern of change. the group to which ribavirin was orally administered had FMDV detection levels similar to or lower than those in the control group at day 2. group in which ribavirin was orally administered along with vaccines was not detected at 10 or 16 dpi. pigs that were administered ribavirin with oil adjuvant were observed to have the highest clinical score (5 points) within 3 dpc. negative control was found to have high RNA copy numbers of viremia. systemic application by an IP route was more effective than a local application by an IM route. simple oral administration, as opposed to inoculation through injection into adult mice, was shown to have a protective effect against FMDVs. the provision of agents absorbed into feed more effectively treated FMD. ribavirin-treated pigs showed signs of dyspnea, anorexia, weakness, and depression. ribavirin-treated pigs showed significant decreases in body weight and red-blood-cell counts until 8 dpi. lowering the administrated amount of antivirals being co-administered with an adjuvant (oil or gel) used in FMD vaccine can enable protection from lethal challenge. administration of the ribavirin and an FMD vaccine synergistically enhances antiviral activity during early viral infection."}
