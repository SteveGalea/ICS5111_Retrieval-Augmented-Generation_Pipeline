{"summary": "mucosal tissues are the major entry points and first line of host defense against human immunodeficiency virus/simian immunodeficiency virus (HIV/SIV) transmission (1\u20133) entry can occur in only a few hours and leads to a productive infection in activated memory CD4+ CCR5+ T cells. a successful HIV/SIV vaccine must induce protective immunity to block initial acquisition and subsequent replication (8\u201310) replicating ovirus vectors can disseminate across multiple mucosal sites irrespective of delivery route (44). a replicating vector engages the mucosal system in concert with a potent boosting agent may significantly bolster protective immunity against HIV/SIV mucosal transmission. compared with its parental VTT strain, MVTT has reduced neurotoxicity and pathogenicity (50\u201352) vaccinia virus Tiantan strain (MVTTSIVgpe) and adenovirus type 5 strain (Ad5SIVgpe) were generated using the homologous recombination technology described previously. the original SIVmac239 stock was a generous gift of P. A. Marx and was further adapted in Chinese macaques. eight monkeys were divided into two groups: four monkeys received the MVTTioin+Adim testing regimen as in study I. four monkeys received an empty MVTT control vector (109 PFU) through intraoral (0.5 ml) and intranasal (0.5 ml) routes and an empty Ad5 control vector (1011 vp in 1 ml of PBS) each animal was challenged intrarectally with 5 105 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID infection with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), simian T cell lymphotropic virus (STLV-1) and simian retrovirus (SRV) were sacrificed humanely by euthanasia. symptoms included severe diarrhea, wasting, weight loss, muscular atrophy, severe ulceration, and hypothermia. a gamma interferon enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (IFN- ELISPOT) assay, multicolor intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) for T lymphocyte polyfunctionality, and carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) staining for ex vivo T cell proliferation. nAbs against SIVmac239 and SIVmac1A11 were evaluated as a function of reductions in Tat- levels of nAbs against the Ad5 and MVTT vectors were measured as a 50% reduction in either reporter-secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) or green fluorescent protein (GFP) activity. levels of SIV RNA in plasma were quantified by real-time PCR as described previously (56). a total of 20 rhesus monkeys that weighed 3 to 5 kg were used in two separate studies: study I and study II. 12 macaques were divided into three groups: 4 monkeys received MVTTSIVgpe (109 PFU in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline [PBS] through intraoral (i.o.) and intranasal (i.n.) (0.5 ml) routes and Ad5SIVgpe three groups (n = 4 per group) were used in study I. two groups (n = 4 per group) were used in study II. emerald symbols represent the four animals in the MVTTioin+Adim group. the method of euthanasia was intravenous injection of pentobarbital sodium (80 mg/kg of body weight) pools of overlapping SIVmac239-specific peptides were obtained through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, National Institute of Health (NIH). these peptide fragments are 15 amino acids in length, with 11 overlapping residues. cyanin (APC)\u2013Cy7, anti-CD28\u2013fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), anti-CD95\u2013phycoerythrin (PE)\u2013Cy5, anti-IFN-\u2013PE, anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNF-)\u2013PE\u2013Cy7, and anti-interleukin-2 (anti-IL-2)\u2013APC (BD Pharmingen) the survival curves were analyzed by log rank (Mantel-Cox) tests. two-tailed P values were calculated for all analyses. RESULTS MVTTioin+Adim regimen elicits potent immune responses in rhesus monkeys. the frequency of positive responses in the MVTTioin+Adim group peaked 9 weeks after initial immunization. responses were predominately against Gag and Pol peptides. positive IFN- responses in the MVTTioin+Adim group declined slightly after boosting. MVTTioin+Adim and Adim+Adim regimens elicited equivalent levels of binding antibodies against the tier 1 virus SIVmac1A11. no detectable nAbs against neutralization-resistant strain SIVmac239 were observed. d by the MVTTioin+Adim regimen would correlate with better control of pathogenic SIVmac239 infection. all animals became infected, except for monkey 2 in the MVTTioin+Adim group. differences in peak and set-point viral loads were observed across all three groups. over the course of infection, up to week 120 after challenge. changes in body weight and CD4 T cell count 3 weeks before and 120 weeks after challenge. values for the last time point before sacrifice were used for animals that were euthanized before 120 weeks after challenge. in the majority of animals, peak responses were primarily against Gag and Pol peptides. despite a decline in antigen-specific CD8+ T cell ELISPOT responses, IFN--secreting cell levels remained relatively stable in the MVTTioin+Adim group. this coincided with a rise in viral plasma loads in both groups of animals. MVTTioin+Adim regimen elicited high levels of CD8+ T cell ELISPOT responses against Gag, Pol, and Env. the frequency of positive responses in the MVTTioin+Adim group peaked 9 weeks after initial immunization, at an average of 5,336 1,459 IFN-secreting cells per million PBMCs. studies I and II provide strong evidence that the MVTTioin+Adim regimen induces a superior, more potent and antigen-specific immune response against pathogenic SIVmac239 infection in Chinese rhesus monkeys. peak levels of SIV-specific IFN- ELISPOT responses to the MVTTioin+Adim or control vector regimen. MVTTioin+Adim regimen elicits potent immune responses in rhesus monkeys. the MVTTioin+Adim regimen contained a combined intraoral (i.o) and intranasal (i.n.) mucosal prime. ELISPOT assays for SIV-specific IFN--secreting cells were performed on PBMCs obtained over the course of immunization. the frequency of positive responses in the MVTTioin+Adim group peaked 9 weeks after initial immunization, at an average of 7,382 3,685 IFN--secreting cells per million PBMCs. all animals but monkey 3 in the MVTTioin+Adim group maintained significantly higher levels of Gag-specific CD8+ TEM cell polyfunctionality. both the MVTTioin+Adim and Adim+Adim regimens elicit equivalent levels of SIVmac239-specific binding antibodies. the MVTTioin+Adim regimen generated significantly higher levels of nAbs against the tier 1 virus SIVmac1A11. no detectable nAbs against neutralization-resistant strain SIVmac239 were observed. the MVTTioin+Adim regimen elicited higher levels of nAbs and cellular immune responses. at 120 weeks postinfection, all four monkeys vaccinated with the MVTTioin+Adim regimen remained clinically healthy. three-fourths of the animals in the Adim+Adim and sham groups developed simian AIDS. SIVmac239 infection boosted the antigen-specific CD8+ T cell ELISPOT responses against the structural proteins Gag, Pol, and Env. response magnitudes were significantly higher in MVTTioin+Adim groups. the MVTTioin+Adim and Adim+Adim vaccine regimens generated distinct immune response profiles. in terms of antibody responses after viral challenge, only minimal differences in anti-SIVmac1A11 binding and neutralizing antibody responses were observed. a second control group of four macaques was inoculated with empty MVTT and Ad5 viral vectors. high levels of Gag-specific CD8+ TEM cells secreting both IFN- and TNF- were identified. the regimen also reproduced the observed protection against the SIVmac239 intrarectal challenge. SIV-specific CD8+ T cell-mediated immunity against Gag and Pol is associated with protection. eight animals vaccinated with the MVTTioin+Adim regimen. four animals vaccinated with the Adim+Adim regimen. replicating vaccinia virus/adenovirus vector-based vaccine regimen primes mucosal system for robust and sustainable immunity against neutralization-resistant SIVmac239 challenge in monkeys. a replicating vector was hypothesized to improve the quantity and the quality of vaccine antigens through de novo synthesis and multiple yet limited rounds of replication. the MVTTioin+Adim regimen combined key correlates induced by other promising vaccine approaches. a recombinant yellow fever 17D (rYF17D) prime vaccine boosted with recombinant Ad5 (59) was able to induce persistent, high-frequency SIV-specific TEM responses. the number of animals was relatively small, limiting the statistical power of these findings. it would be ideal to examine the protective potential of the MVTTioin+Adim regimen against virus swarms through repeated low-dose rather than single high-dose challenge. it is uncertain whether any of the observed SIV-specific immune protection against high-dose viral challenge was due to unique genotypic features of Chinese rhesus monkeys. the MVTTioin+Adim regimen is superior to the Adim+Adim regimen. it is unclear whether immune responses specific to the mucosal surface correlated with protection and disease attenuation in infected animals."}
