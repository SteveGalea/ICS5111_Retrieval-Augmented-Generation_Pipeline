{"summary": "scFvs were constructed from the enriched antibody secreting EBV transformed cells. scFvs showed cross-reactivity against both the clade C and B V3 peptides and did not show any reactivity against other unrelated peptides in ELISA. clones were pretested for antigen binding, a comparatively small library sufficed for the selection of a considerable number of unique antigen binding phage. this is the first study to generate anti-V3 scFvs against HIV-1 Clade C. hybridoma technology combines antigen specific pre-selection of EBV transformed B cells with the construction of a phage library. researchers are using this technology for the production of antibodies with the desired isotype specificities and affinity for research, clinical and industrial applications. a limited number of monoclonal antibodies are generated against the HIV-1 Clade C which is the most predominant subtype worldwide and in India [21]. the V3 region of HIV-1 gp120 is an important target to induce neutralizing antibodies against different strains of HIV-1. the numerical values on the extreme right of table represent the mean 50% neutralization titers (ID50) defined as the reciprocal dilution of plasma which neutralized 50% of viral infection. each experiment was performed at least two independent times and in duplicates. cells from 5 out of 7 wells showing V3 binding with OD > 0.6 were expanded in a six-well plate, pooled and transferred to a T- 25 flask. PBMCs were subjected to EBV transformation in 96 well culture plate and expanded to 24 well stage and then to six well stage. 96 well culture plate 48 4Number of wells successfully EBV transformed 48 5Number of wells secreting anti-V3 Abs (OD>2) in 96 well stage(first screening) 7 6Number of wells secreting anti-V3 Abs (OD>0.6) in 24 well stage(second screening) 5 7/48 (approx 14.6%) wells showed positive binding (OD>2) with V3 peptide and expanded to 24 well stage. the heavy chains VH1, VH4, VH5 and VH6 were preferentially more expressed while VH2 and VH3 were very less expressed. all the 30 kappa light chain combinations were successfully amplified and expressed almost at the same level. clones 3 and 6 showed identical DNA fingerprinting patterns. clones 3 and 6 showed identical DNA fingerprinting patterns. clones 3 and 6 showed identical DNA fingerprinting patterns.

ELISA wells were coated with the V3C and V3B peptide. MPER peptide, ID loop peptide, BSA and a peptide pool were used as negative controls. the experiment was done in duplicates and repeated at least twice. ten anti-V3 scFv sequences are distinct. nine out of the ten sequences are distinct. clones 3C3C and 3E7B show similar gene usage. scFv protein of 32kDa was expressed in different elute fractions E1 to E5. protein samples were concentrated using ultrafiltration columns (Ambion) over a 10kDa cut off. agarose gel electrophoresis (1%) and purification of scFvs. the binding of scFv antibodies was determined by ELISA against V3 peptides of clade C and B, MPER and ID peptides of HIV, peptide pool (unrelated viruses) and BSA. the binding of scFv antibodies was determined by ELISA against clade C and B, peptide pool (unrelated viruses) and BSA. scFv (HepB) is an scFv against the Hepatitis B surface antigen (negative control) and 1418 is human antibody to parvovirus (negative control). each experiment was performed at least two independent times. twenty nine randomly selected clones from the transformed cells library exhibited the VH4 and VH5 gene usage. the light chain did not show any preferential gene usage and all the light chains were successfully amplified. successful isolation of positive clones with higher affinity and specificity is possible when a library is more diverse. stringency in the biopanning also reduces the number of false positive clones. none of our clones had internal Sfi1- NotI sites. this reduced the number of non-specific phage binders. scFv phage library generated anti-V3 human scFvs against clade C HIV-1. by antigen pre-selection, the phage library served as an adequate source of positive clones. the combination of EBV transformation and selection of immortalized lines provides a useful strategy for specific recombinant antibodies. the neutralization assay was carried out in 96-well tissue culture plates. 50 l of the heat inactivated plasma/purified scFv was added to 200 TCID 50 of the virus and incubated for 1 h. a cell control well containing culture media only and a virus control well were tested in parallel.
