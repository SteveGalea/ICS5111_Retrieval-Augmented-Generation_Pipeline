{"summary": "a large number of population-based observational studies have reported a positive association between ambient concentrations of air pollution and hospitalizations for respiratory and cardiac disease. improvements in both air quality and health effects have been documented following a number of large-scale changes in local air pollution emissions. study assesses the health impact of the closure of an oil refinery in Oakville, Canada on residents\u2019 hospitalizations. study focused on changes in ambient air pollution in relation to those in morbidity records to measure the impact of the refinery closure on public health. no major changes to pollution sources in the local region occurred during the study period aside from the closure of the refinery described in the following. data collected from two national air pollution surveillance stations. stations 61602 and 61603 recorded air pollutant monitoring data for some portion of the study period (1996\u20132012) no one station has complete data for the entire study period. 94.8% Oakville station 61603 SO2 28 April 2003 31 December 2007 75.9% CO 29 April 2003 31 December 2011 97.5% PM2.5 29 May 2003 31 December 2011 98.6% O3 29 April 2003 31 December 2011 98.4% 2.1.3. weather data Hourly temperature and climate records were obtained from the Climate Data records of ECCC for the study period (1996\u20132012) seasonal (four 3-month blocks, seasons 1 to 4) aggregate counts were standardized against a distribution of six age categories. the GTA had a population of 6.3 million people in 2006, and encompasses Oakville, which comprises only a small portion of the overall population. t the city-specific age category health count at given time t, P c the city-specific age category population for the given time block, and P the total reference population (GTA) for the same. the standardization was done by blocks (e.g., 3 months), multiplying the resulting seasonal totals by 4000 to become standardized cases per thousand persons per year. data All data referenced in the following section were recorded in, and around, the city of Oakville, Ontario (ON), Canada. Typical monthly average temperatures range from 5 \u00b0C to +26 \u00b0C. the city itself is largely suburban, and major pollutant sources nearby include the city of Hamilton, ON. the refinery and oakville stations recorded air pollutant monitoring data for some portion of the study period (1996\u20132012), although no one station has complete data for the entire period. the figure includes a prevailing wind vector, accounting for approximately 40% of all hourly wind directions recorded between the two weather stations. 96.6% NO2 01 January 1996 31 December 2002 92.1% PM2.5 NA O3 01 January 1996 31 December 2002 94.8% Oakville station 61603 SO2 28 April 2003 31 December 2007 75.9% CO 29 April 2003 31 December 2004 94.3% NO2 29 April 2003 31 December 2011 97.5% PM2.5 29 May 2003 31 December 2011 98.6% O3 29 April 2003 31 December 2011 98.4% 2.1.3. Health Data Daily morbidity (hospitalization) counts for Oakville, data were obtained for air emissions from the refinery of SO2, CO, NO2, total PM, PM10, and PM2.5 for 2002\u20132005. daily values of sulfur dioxide, the indicator pollutant for the oil refinery emissions, were available for 1996\u20132002 at the Refinery station. the Refinery station was closed in 2002 and the Oakville station was opened in 2003. the figure includes a prevailing wind vector, accounting for approximately 40% of all hourly wind directions recorded between the two weather stations. the figure includes a prevailing wind vector, accounting for approximately 40% of all hourly wind directions recorded between the two weather stations, 7868 (Piers) and 5097 (Pearson) the international classification of diseases 10th Revision (ICD-10) [15] was used to identify circulatory (I00\u2013I99) and respiratory (J00\u2013J99) diagnoses. data recorded under ICD-9 were converted to ICD-10 based on the conversion table provided by the Canadian Institute for Health Information. we used six age categories (years): 1\u20135, 6\u201320, 21\u201365, 66\u201375, 76\u201385, and 86 or older. the specific categories chosen here are a convenient choice for other studies and analyses. a 15-week block centered on that maximum week (i.e., 7 weeks prior to, 7 weeks following, and the maximum week) the proposed dynamic approach has value for our analysis over the traditional seasonal approach with a pre-determined fixed time period. the dynamic approach puts weight on exact episode occurrence time rather than on calendar time. aggregate counts were standardized against a distribution of six age categories. the GTA had a population of 6.3 million people in 2006, and encompasses Oakville, which comprises only a small portion of the overall population (approximately 3%). the yearly cold and respiratory virus epidemic has variable start and termination dates year-by-year. it is possible to locate the maximum weekly rate of respiratory hospitalization (between September and July) and then take a 15-week block centered on that maximum week (i.e., 7 weeks prior to, 7 weeks following, and the maximum week) this 15 weeks of age-standardized rates can then be aggregated and scaled to cases per thousand persons per year. the closure of the refinery in 2004\u20132005 reduced emissions of SO2, CO, NO2, PM, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by considerable amounts. annual emissions of SO2 were reduced from 6000 tons in 2002 to 900 tons (15%) in 2005, corresponding to the three months of operation in calendar year 2005. the ambient, unrestricted ambient concentration dropped 0.4 ppb, from 2.62 ppb to 2.26 ppb. this larger reduction for the sub-case of wind from the south-west may reflect the impact of the refinery closure. it appears that the variability of the exposure in both stations decreased. 1.6 1.4 7 1997 19.1 5.9 37 3.3 1.9 10 1.6 1.4 9 1998 19.5 6.5 41 3.3 1.8 10 1.6 1.4 9 2000 20.2 6.1 36 3.3 1.9 9 2.0 1.6 9 2000 20.2 6.1 36 3.3 1.9 9 2.0 1.6 9 2000 20.2 6.1 40 3.1 2.0 13 1.9 1.5 9 2001 21.7 6.7 38 3.2 1.9 11 2.1 1.5 9 2002 20.8 6.3 40 3.1 1.9 9 1.9 1.5 8 2003 2 in oakville, respiratory hospitalization rates were up to 50% greater in the cold season (winter, January\u2013March, and fall, October\u2013December, in white dots, Figure 2) than in the warm season (spring, April\u2013June, and summer, July-September, in dark dots, Figure 2). seasonal age-standardized SHRs were used to detect any changes in the number of hospitalizations after the refinery closure. in all cases, the decrease in Oakville stood out as unusual among nearby cities, and against the demographic reference population of the GTA in 2006. the peak of the respiratory-related hospitalization rates typically occurs during the yearly epidemic of cold and respiratory virus infections. we therefore considered a dynamic approach of taking 15-week blocks centered on the peak week of respiratory hospitalizations for a given cold season (October\u2013March) and city. ICD Cause Oakville * Toronto * 2 p-Value 2 p-Value All-cause (1) 5.1 0.0816 2.3 0.5291 Circulatory (2) 0.8 0.3071 0.3 0.6386 Respiratory (3) 2.2 0.0006 0.1 0.8564 Non-cardiorespiratory (1 (2 +3)) the closure of the refinery in 2004\u20132005 reduced emissions of SO2, CO, NO2, PM, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by considerable amounts. annual reported emissions of SO2 were reduced from 6000 tons in 2002 to 900 tons (15%) in 2005. the wind direction-restricted average hourly ambient SO2 fell further by 20% after the refinery closure in 2004. the wind direction-restricted average hourly ambient SO2 dropped 0.4 ppb, from 2.62 ppb to 2.26 ppb. this larger reduction for the sub-case of wind from the south-west may reflect the impact of the refinery closure. hospital admission data showed little annual daily change in non-accidental all-cause, circulatory and respiratory gross number of hospitalizations over the study period (1996\u20132012) in Oakville. the unstandardized hospital admissions in Table 4 do not reflect demographic (e.g. we age-standardized the seasonal counts for Oakville against the GTA as a 6.3-million-person demographic reference population. in oakville, respiratory hospitalization rates were up to 50% greater in the cold season (winter, January\u2013March, and fall, October\u2013December, in white dots, Figure 2) than in the warm season (spring, April\u2013June, and summer, July\u2013September, in dark dots, Figure 2). in all cases, the decrease in Oakville stood out as unusual among nearby cities, and against the demographic reference population of the GTA in 2006. a dynamic approach of taking 15-week blocks centered on the peak week of respiratory hospitalizations for a given cold season and city. cold-season peak-centered respiratory hospitalizations in Oakville fell by 2.2 cases per thousand persons per year from before the refinery closure to after, excluding the two outlier years. Across the same period, no immediate decrease (after accounting for trend) was found in Toronto. census data from 2001, 2006 and 2011 showed no corresponding change in median income, sex, education status, labor force status, or industry of main employment. the time period of interest shows a steady increase in traffic volume and density, which we cannot plausibly link to a sudden decrease in respiratory-related hospitalizations in Oakville. the 1996\u20132002 span of available data from 61602 should give reasonably accurate estimates of ambient air quality before closure. the NPRI data used as a gauge of pollution emissions from the refinery are not entirely reliable. the closure of the refinery coincided with a measurable reduction in hourly ambient SO2 levels in the city of Oakville only, not in Toronto. this is another strength of the study, as with the local nature of SO2 ambient concentration we would not expect to see step-function reductions of SO2 concentration outside of the immediate region surrounding the refinery. a decrease in the ambient concentration of sulfur dioxide (SO2) in Oakville appears to be in addition to the background decrease in SO2 levels associated with the reduction in allowable sulfur content in gasoline. however, examination of the present data revealed neither a significant decrease in 2001\u20132003 such as was observed in SO2 with the roll-out of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act (1999) [35] regulations. data availability for the region and the study shows measurable reductions in ambient SO2 levels as would be experienced by the residents of Oakville. no other contributory factor was found which could explain this decrease."}
