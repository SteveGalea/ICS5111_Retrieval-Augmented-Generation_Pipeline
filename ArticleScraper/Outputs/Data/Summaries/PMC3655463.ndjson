{"summary": "HCV is a major cause of chronic hepatitis worldwide, and end-stage liver disease caused by HCV has increasingly become the leading indication for liver transplantation (LT) it has been well known that HCV reinfection following LT examined by HCV RNA detection using the polymerase chain reaction occurs almost universally [1]. the absence of preventive strategy for HCV reinfection after transplant is a major challenge for the recipients undergoing LT. recurrence of HCV infection in the liver allograft is universal after LT, and its natural history is variable. a number of risk factors have been mentioned regarding this clinical issue. earlier studies have advocated that HCV recurrence may be more severe in living donor LT compared to cadaveric LT. however, there are no differences observed in hepatitis C recurrence rate, severity of intrahepatic pathology, or graft and patient survival between living donor LT and cadaveric LT recipients. viral loads dropped with an average half-life of 0.8 hours during the anhepatic phase. the viral load reached a plateau before rising, suggesting a nonhepatic source supplied virions. the remaining 96% occurred in the liver. IL28B polymorphism has been strongly associated with SVR in patients with genotype 1 chronic HCV infection who are treated with pEG-IFN plus RBV in the nontransplant setting. authors suggested recipient IL28B TT genotype is associated with more severe histological recurrence of HCV after LT. methylprednisolone treatment for acute rejection led to a 4-100-fold increase in serum HCV RNA. glucocorticoids are often given as an induction protocol during LT. glucocorticoids are used as maintenance immunosuppression after operation. plasmacytoid dendritic cells are capable of producing large amounts of IFN against HCV infection. prednisolone suppressed the functions of plasmacytoid dendritic cells by promoting their apoptosis. boluses for treating acute rejection can increase the viral load. immunophilins can work as a supportive role in viral infection. it is conceivable that CyA affects multiple steps in the life cycle of HCV. but there is controversy about the anti-HCV effects of cyclosporine A in vivo. rapamycin induces autophagy through inhibiting mTOR. autophagy is incomplete through blocking the maturation of autophagosomes to autolysosomes. rapamycin could affect HCV recurrence and antiviral interferon therapy. nonviral Factors One study examined 307 patients who underwent LT for HCV over a 10-year period. earlier studies have advocated that HCV recurrence may be more severe in living donor LT compared to cadaveric LT. a sharp decrease in viral load during the anhepatic phase and immediately after graft reperfusion. this decrease was presumably attributed to massive binding of HCV to the hepatocytes. the authors also mentioned that viral loads then continued to drop up to 23 hours after implantation. some studies showed that the severity of recurrence and levels of viral replication for HCV hepatitis after LT were higher in patients with genotype 1b HCV infection than other genotypes. another study by Gayowski et al. reported that the rate of recurrent HCV hepatitis, timing to recurrence, severity of recurrence and response to IFN therapy did not differ among genotypes. retrospective study of 347 first LT recipients was performed to evaluate association of CMV infection and disease with recurrent hepatitis C after LT. it was found that short-term CMV viremia does not enhance the replication of HCV after LT. plasmacytoid dendritic cells are capable of producing large amounts of IFN against HCV infection in this specific CD4 T cell response [36, 37] plasmacytoid dendritic cells are capable of producing large amounts of IFN against HCV infection in this specific CD4 T cell response. cyclophilins have an important role in viral replication and de novo virus production. recent data suggest that HCV replication is dependent on the interaction between cyclophilin B and nonstructural protein 5B (NS5B, HCV RNA polymerase) to stimulate its RNA binding activity. it is conceivable that CyA affects multiple steps in the life cycle of HCV. MPA could have effects in synergy with IFN- on HCV replication in the same HCV experiments. rapamycin engages the cytosolic protein FKBP12 to form a complex. rapamycin induces autophagy through inhibiting mTOR. new strategy to recurrent HCV infection after LT is almost universal among recipients with active infections at the time of transplantation. accelerated progression of fibrosis is noted in those recipients with recurrent HCV after transplant, and at least 25% of patients will eventually develop liver cirrhosis within 5 to 10 years. pegylated IFN plus ribavirin therapy is the standard of care for chronic hepatitis C. however, the treatment has shown to be limited in patients with decompensated cirrhosis because of the frequent and severe treatment-related complication. telaprevir and boceprevir triple therapy showed a higher SVR rates compared to pegylated IFN/RBV therapy in advanced fibrosis and cirrhotic patients. severe advanced events rates were also increased in patients receiving triple therapy. preemptive or early posttransplant antiviral therapy aims to prevent the rapid development of chronic hepatitis before there is evidence of recurrent HCV infection. compared to immunocompetent subjects, antiviral therapy response decreases during this period because of the high level of immunosuppression. three systematic reviews showed 20\u201340% of SVR rate in genotype 1 and 50\u2013100% in genotype 2/3 subjects using pegylated IFN-based therapy for recurrent hepatitis C after LT. the same result is also found in the histological improvement, regardless of necroinflammation or fibrosis. the first generation of DAAs, telaprevir and boceprevir were recently used to enhance the efficacy of the standard regiment, Pegylated IFN plus RBV [76] there are some limitations for safety and tolerance. pegylated interferon (IFN) plus ribavirin (RBV) combination therapy is the standard of care for chronic hepatitis C. but the treatment has shown to be limited in patients with decompensated cirrhosis because of the frequent and severe treatment-related complication. direct acting antivirals (DAAs), including protease, polymerase or other nonstructural protein inhibitors, are the newly developed agents for HCV treatment. current data on HCV treatment using DAA are limited in patients with cirrhosis. studies using hepatitis C immunoglobulin or monoclonal antibody show only transient decrease of liver HCV RNA levels in liver transplant recipients. compared to immunocompetent subjects, antiviral therapy response decreases during this period because of the high level of immunosuppression. conventional IFN-based therapy was used to treat recurrent hepatitis C after LT. compared to conventional IFN-based therapy, pegylated IFN-based therapy showed a significant improvement of SVR rate. the same result is also found in the histological improvement. the first generation of DAAs, telaprevir and boceprevir were recently used to enhance the efficacy of the standard regiment, Pegylated IFN plus RBV [76]. the first generation of DAAs, telaprevir and boceprevir increased the SVR rate in nave patients, relapsers, and nonresponders. current therapy against HCV infection is limited by resistance, adverse effects, and high costs. absence of preventive regiment is a major limitation for patients undergoing LT for HCV-related liver failure. accelerated progression to liver cirrhosis after graft reinfection are two major clinical issues leading to poor posttransplant outcome of the recipients. HCV entry to the hepatocytes requires interaction of its viral envelope glycoproteins (E1 and E2) and the cell membrane. both E1 and E2 contain putative fusion domains. sulfate (HS), SR-BI, and claudin-1 (CLDN1), occludin (OCLN) have been demonstrated to interact with the soluble truncated form of HCV E2 [89]. SR-BI, an 82 kDa glycoprotein with a large extracellular loop, is highly expressed in the liver [92] the LDLR has been shown to mediate the internalization of serum-derived HCV into CD81-deficient HepG2 cells by binding virus-LDL particles. the LDLR has been shown to mediate the internalization of serum-derived HCV into CD81-deficient HepG2 cells by binding virus-LDL particles. accumulated data have tried to unravel potential molecular mechanisms of HCV entry. some studies described the critical role of the association between CD81 and CLDN1 coreceptors in HCV entry. a rate-limiting role for SR-BI in HCV infection has been reported. anti-CD81 antibodies completely protected human liver-uPA-SCID mice from a subsequent challenge with HCV consensus strains of different genotypes. however, administration of anti-CD81 antibodies after viral challenge had no effect. anti-SR-BI antibodies are another interesting strategy to prevent HCV entry. the human liver-chimeric Alb-uPA/SCID mouse model also showed that PS-ON block de novo HCV infection. in clinical setting, patients spontaneously resolving from acute HCV infection tend to have an early induction of neutralizing antibody response. in chronic infection patients have a delayed initiation of neutralizing antibody response. new conformational and conserved epitopes have been identified in the N-terminal part of E2 [89]. the conserved nature of these epitopes holds great promise for the development of potent inhibitors for HCV entry. CLDN1 is a 23 kDa four transmembrane protein expressed in the tight junction of polarized cells. nonjunctional CLDN1 may localize to the tight junction and the basolateral surfaces of hepatocytes. recent studies have shown that nonjunctional CLDN1 may be also involved in HCV entry. HCV is believed to first interact with HS and LDLR on the membrane surface of hepatocytes to allow concentration of the virion. interaction with other host factors such as SR-BI, CD81, CLDN1 and OCLN leads to viral internalization via the so-called clathrin-mediated endocytosis. anti-SR-BI antibodies have been demonstrated to inhibit HCVcc infection in vitro. a human monoclonal antibody targeting SR-BI effectively precluded HCV infection and viral spread without affecting viral replication. anti-CLDN1 antibodies inhibit cell entry of highly infectious escape variants of HCV that are resistant to host neutralizing antibodies. erlotinib and dasatinib are also promising HCV inhibitors in preventing HCV reinfection after LT. the outcome of HCV recipients after liver transplantation."}
