{"summary": "in 2004, a new biomarker sCD14-subtypes (presepsin) was found. its value was shown in the diagnosis and evaluation of sepsis. a literature search using multiple databases was performed for articles. in 2004, a new biomarker sCD14-subtypes (presepsin) was found[9] and its value was shown in the diagnosis and evaluation of sepsis. a series of downstream tyrosine protein kinases and mitogen-activated protein kinase are gradually activated including the nuclear transcription factor NF-B. this leads to the release of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-, IFN-, IL-1 ar macrophages, neutrophils and endothelial cells release more cytokines and cell adhesion molecules. this could trigger intense and excessive systemic inflammatory response and activate the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems, resulting in SIRS, sepsis shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) the specificity of sCD14 was poor, and the level of sCD14 significantly increased in patients with coronary heart disease, heart failure, liver cirrhosis, high blood glucose and so on. preepsin is generated as the body response to bacterial infection, and phagocytosis against bacteria may play a major role. Spanuth et al[21] studied the concentration of presepsin in emergency patients on admission. they found that it was significantly higher in sepsis patients than in healthy people. the concentration of presepsin was positively correlated with APACHE II score and SOFA score. sepsis biomarkers with a high sensitivity and specificity are required in addition to rapid detection methods. plasma, serum heparin, heparin whole blood, and EDTA anti-coagulated serum can be used as the detection samples. Presepsin was superior to PCT in the assessment of prognosis. the level of presepsin was significantly different between the survival group and the death group. the level of presepsin was significantly different between the survival group and the death group. the sensitivity of presepsin was not different significantly between patients with gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections. there were no immediate reports on presepsin levels of patients with atypical pathogen infection but without mycobacterium tuberculosis infection."}
