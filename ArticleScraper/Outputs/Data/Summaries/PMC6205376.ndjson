{"summary": "enteroviruses include polioviruses, the causative agent of poliomyelitis. infection with poliovirus is controlled by vaccination, although some strains of polio and vaccine-derived virus continue to circulate and cause disease. EV-A71 is most prevalent in east Asia and along the Pacific rim. hWARS expression in EV-A71\u2013resistant cells increased EV-A71 susceptibility. hWARS expression in mice via lentivirus transduction increased EV-A71 susceptibility. hWARS expression in mice increased EV-A71 susceptibility, demonstrating that expression of this molecule by itself increases infection. hWARS is a remarkably multifunctional protein, and several studies have demonstrated that it has additional roles as an extracellular ligand. this activity depends on secreted hWARS and its binding to E-cadherin (11). this activity depends on secreted hWARS and its binding to E-cadherin (11). hWARS is typically expressed as a cytoplasmic protein (i); however, the secreted form binds to and promotes entry of EV-A71. hWARS is enclosed in a vesicle in the cell (iv) and is released into the extracellular medium. tRNA synthetase is the only tRNA synthetase that is IFN- induced. EV-A71, as well as other enteroviruses, will induce an inflammatory response. thereby, IFN- can be considered a proviral factor that positively reinforces an EV-A71/IFN-/hWARS loop. using cryoelectron microscopy (20) make it feasible to explore such interactions and should provide additional information about the interaction of the virus with hWARS. it will also be of interest to determine whether the tRNA synthetase enzymatic activity of hWARS is required for enterovirus entry and whether angiostatic, immunomodulatory, and proviral activities depend on distinct structural elements of hWARS."}
