{"summary": "the arenavirus genome encodes for a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) with endonuclease cap snatching activity [2] and a small RING finger protein (Z) with matrix-like functions. the small segment encodes for the viral nucleoprotein (NP), endowed with a 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 exoribonuclease activity [4], and the glycoprotein precursor. NIAID is considered a select agent by the centers for disease control and prevention. arenaviruses associated with hemorrhagic diseases in humans are generally considered to be non-cytopathic viruses [21]\u2013[23] candid#1 contains multiple amino acid changes in GP, NP and L that hinder identification of genetic markers of attenuation [27]\u2013[32]. we have recently documented an induction of type I IFN in response to pathogenic, Romero, and attenuated, Candid#1 strains of JUNV infection in human lung epithelium carcinoma cells (A549). IFN-I-independent, caspase-9, Apaf-1-dependent signaling trough RIG-I/MDA5-MAVS-mediated induction of Puma and Noxa transcription [36], [40] or MAVS mediated IFN-I, IRF3, NF-B-independent, caspase-3, -9-dependent [35]; or IFN-I, NF-B-independent, RIG-I-TRAF3/TRAF2/ human lung epithelial carcinoma (A549) cells were maintained in minimum essential medium (MEM) or F-12K medium Kaighn\u2019s modification supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin (10,000 U/mL) apoptosis was enhanced by RIG-I signaling but independent of production of type I IFN. all work with JUNV Romero was performed at the University of Texas Medical Branch BSL-4 facilities (Robert E. Shope Laboratory or the Galveston National Laboratory) all work with JUNV Romero was performed in accordance with institutional health and safety guidelines and federal regulations [45]. cells were mock-infected or infected with JUNV in triplicates. treatment with camptothecin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at 20 M for 16 h. proteins were resolved on 4\u201320% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to PVDF membrane using mini Trans-Blot Electrophoretic Transfer Cell apparatus (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) primary antibodies used for western blot analysis were rabbit monoclonal RIG-I (D14G6), cleaved CASP3 (Asp175) (5A1E), cleaved PARP (Asp214) (D64E10) XP (C Viruses Romero (GenBank accession nos. AY619640 and AY619641) and Candid#1 (GenBank accession no. U70801) strains of JUNV were obtained from Dr. Thomas G. Ksiazek and Dr. Robert Tesh. cells were mock-infected or infected with JUNV in triplicates. cells were stained using FITC Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit. treatment with camptothecin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) at 20 M for 16 h was included as a positive control of apoptosis induction for the detection of cleaved CASP3 and PARP. down-regulation of Gene Expression via siRNA ON-TARGET plus SMART pool siRNA targeting human DDX58, IRF3 or Non-targeting Pool were transfected into A549 cells by electroporation using ved CASP3 (Asp175) (5A1E), cleaved PARP (Asp214) (D64E10) secondary antibodies used were HRP-linked goat anti-rabbit IgG (Cell Signaling technology, Inc., Danvers, MA) and donkey anti-goat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) cells were mock-infected (Mock) or infected (MOI = 1.75 PFU/cell) with Candid#1. production of infectious progeny and cell viability determined by plaque assay. cell viability of mock-infected samples was assigned as 100%. the percentage of late apoptotic cells in candid#1-infected samples increased from 5.2% at day 3 p.i. to 18.3% at 4 days p.i. the percentage of late apoptotic cells in mock-infected samples increased from 5.2% at day 3 p.i. to 18.3% at 4 days p.i. we also detected the large fragment of cleaved executioner CASP3 and cleaved PARP, a CASP3 downstream substrate. treatment with camptothecin was included as a positive control of apoptosis induction. infection of human lung epithelium carcinoma cells with the attenuated strain of JUNV activated the RIG-I/IRF3 signaling pathway. -specific siRNA exhibited efficient silencing of IRF3 expression (70\u201380% reduction) at 1 and 2.5 days p.i. cell viability was 55.41.8 and 67.12.4% in IRF3 and RIG-I knockdown cells, respectively, versus 48.61.4% in Candid#1-infected cells transfected with control siRNA. at 1.5 days post transfection cells were infected with candid#1 or mock-infected (Mock-infection) a. Down-regulation of RIG-I and IRF3 upon transfection. cell lysate was collected at 0, 1, and 2.5 days p.i. and subjected to western blotting analysis. RIG-I-enhanced type I IFN-independent apoptosis in response to JUNV infection. A\u2013B. shRNA-mediated stable down-regulation of RIG-I expression diminished DNA fragmentation in infected A549 cells. reduced DNA fragmentation was observed despite a 5.8-fold increased production of infectious progeny over that observed in infected Control KD cells at 4 days p.i.. in order to exclude possibility that the apoptotic response to JUNV infection was cell type-specific, we also mock-infected or infected with candid#1 or Romero JUNV human hepatocarcinoma cells with a functional (Huh7) or non-functional (Hu production of infectious progeny of both candid#1 and Romero viruses was similar in both cell lines. induction of DNA fragmentation in candid#1-infected Vero cells was 5.8-, 15.2- and 9.2-fold higher than that in mock-infected cells at days 2, 3 and 4 p.i., respectively. candid#1 infection induces apoptosis in A549 cells. cells were mock-infected (Mock) or infected (MOI = 1.75 PFU/cell) with candid#1. production of infectious progeny and cell viability determined by plaque assay. apoptosis induction in candid#1-infected cells was detected 2 days p.i. the percentage of late apoptotic cells increased from 5.2% at day 3 p.i. to 18.3% at 4 days p.i. ation in candid#1-infected cells was 1.2-, 2.2- and 1.9-fold of that in mock-infected cells at days 2, 3 and 4 p.i., respectively. treatment with camptothecin was included as a positive control of apoptosis induction. both mock-and Candid#1-infected cells transfected with IRF3-specific siRNA showed efficient silencing of IRF3 expression (70\u201380% reduction) at 1 and 2.5 days p.i. the induction was observed even in the cells transfected with RIG-I-specific siRNA (Figure 2A) A549 cells were transfected with siRNA targeting RIG-I, IRF3, non-targeting siRNA (Control) or mock-transfected (Mock-infection) at 1.5 days post transfection cells were infected with candid#1 or mock-infected (Mock-infection). poly(I:C) and cell lysates were examined by western blotting. induction of RIG-I expression upon poly(I:C) treatment was detected in Control KD but not in RIG-I KD cell lysates. at 4 days p.i. we observed increased levels of DNA fragmentation in control KD cells infected with either candid#1 (1.8-fold) or Romero (1.5-fold) reduced DNA fragmentation in the infected KD cells was observed despite a 5.8-fold increased production of infectious progeny over that observed in infected Control KD cells at 4 days p.i. production of infectious progeny of both candid#1 and Romero viruses was similar in both cell lines. production of infectious progeny of both candid#1 and Romero viruses was similar in both cell lines. induction of DNA fragmentation in candid#1-infected Vero cells was 5.8-, 15.2- and 9.2-fold higher than that in mock-infected cells at days 2, 3 and 4 p.i. apoptosis induction in human hepatocarcinoma and non-human primate Vero cells was stronger upon infection with attenuated strain of JUNV. the magnitude and kinetics of apoptosis induction in Huh7 and Vero cells were stronger upon infection with attenuated strain of JUNV. uclear lineage, JUNV primary target [50]\u2013[54] or parenchymal cells, may contribute to host antiviral response by limiting virus replication and spread. immunogenicity of apoptotic cancer cells has been attributed to the exposure of calreticulin, an endoplasmic reticulum chaperon, on the cell surface during early apoptosis. IFN-I independent RLH-mediated induction of apoptosis in response to dsRNA, RNA and DNA viruses has been documented. deficiencies in RLH or apoptotic pathways often result in enhanced viral replication or pathogenicity in cultured cells and animal models. we have used an ELISA-based assay that allowed us to detect and quantify formation of mono- and oligo-nucleosome in low number of cells. apoptosis induction in human hepatocarcinoma cells in response to candid#1 infection induced cytoplasmic nucleosomes. Vaccine strain of JUNV Candid#1 induces more potent apoptosis than virulent Romero strain in human hepatocarcinoma and vero cells, but not in A549 or Vero E6 cells. future studies should address the detailed molecular mechanism underlying JUNV induced apoptosis and its contribution to virus attenuation or pathogenesis."}
