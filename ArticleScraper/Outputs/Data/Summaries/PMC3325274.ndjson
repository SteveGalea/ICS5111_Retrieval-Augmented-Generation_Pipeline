{"summary": "genital CpHV-1 infections are characterized by painful erythematous-oedematous lesions evolving into vesicles and ulcers healing in two weeks. reactivation of latent virus and mucosal shedding are responsible for CpHV-1 transmission to other animals in the same flock and to newborns. intranasal vaccination with a live attenuated gE negative bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1) vaccine was shown to confer partial cross-reactive protection to goats challenged vaginally with virulent CpHV-1 [13], [12]. intranasal vaccination with a live attenuated gE negative Bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1) vaccine was shown to confer partial cross-reactive protection to goats eight female goats (18 months-2 years) of mixed breed were employed in the study. before vaccination the goats were tested to insure they were negative for both serum VN antibodies, serum CpHV-1-specific IgG and vaginal CpHV-1-specific IgG [18]. inactivated CpHV-1 emulsified with 2 ml of MF59TM or left unvaccinated. experiments carried out as follows: experiment n.1, n = 4 goats, experiment n.2, n = 6 goats. vaccines immediately injected subcutaneously in the neck. serum was obtained after centrifugation of non-heparinized glass tubes. vaginal samples were collected by flushing the vaginal lumen with a sterile pipette containing 2 ml of sterile PBS. sera and vaginal washes were stored at 80\u00b0C until tested. the colorimetric reaction was measured at 405 nm with an ELISA plate reader. the antibody titers were determined as the reciprocal of the highest sample dilution exhibiting an O.D. value of 0.2 units above the O.D. of negative control sera. PBMC cultures were stimulated with inactivated CpHV-1 (10 g/ml) a commercially available ELISPOT kit specific for bovine IFN-gamma was employed. the test was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. MC suspensions were directly cultured onto nitrocellulose-well plates included in the kit (Leica MS5, Leica Microsystems Srl, Milan, Italy). the challenge was performed two weeks following the second immunization in vaccinated animals. cumulative clinical score was determined in each animal by grading the clinical signs as follows: 0, absent; 1, mild; 2, moderate; and 3, severe. real-time PCR A real-time PCR assay was employed to detect and quantitate CpHV-1 genomic DNA in vaginal swabs and sacral ganglia. data on latency in sacral ganglia are expressed as arithmetic mean SEM of the log10 transformed number of CpHV-1 genomes. data were recorded from day 0 to day 14 post challenge (i.e., vaginal CpHV-1 shedding titers, number of CpHV-1 genomes in vaginal swabs and clinical scores) the viral titer was 106.5 50% tissue culture infectious doses. the suspension was tested and found to be free from bacterial and fungal contamination. the adjuvant employed in the study was the oil-in-water emulsion MF59TM. experiment n.3, n = 9 goats (three goats received inactivated CpHV-1 only; three goats received inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59TM; three goats remained unvaccinated); experiment n.4, n = 9 goats (three goats received inactivated CpHV-1 only; three goats received inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59TM. sera were heat-inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 30 min and serial 2-fold dilutions starting from 12 (of each individual sample) were mixed with 100 TCID50 of CpHV-1 Ba.1 strain in 96-well microtiter plates (Corning Inc., NY, USA) the plates were kept at room temperature for 45 min, and then 20,000 MDBK cells were added to each well. the colorimetric reaction was measured at 405 nm with an ELISA plate reader. the antibody titers were determined as the reciprocal of the highest sample dilution exhibiting an O.D. value of 0.2 units above the O.D. of negative control sera. the levels of soluble IL-4 in culture supernatants were measured by using a commercially available ELISA kit (Bovigam, Prionics, Victoria, Australia) the levels of soluble IFN-gamma in culture supernatants were determined by using a commercially available ELISA kit (thermo Scientific) the test was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. vaginal swabs were collected daily and placed in 1.5 ml of DMEM. the supernatant was treated with 0.1 ml of an antibiotic solution. each sample was serially diluted (10-fold) and inoculated onto MDBK cells placed in 96-well microtiter plates. goats were also examined daily to evaluate the severity of the infection. data on latency in sacral ganglia are expressed as arithmetic mean SD of the log10 transformed number of CpHV-1 genomes. data on latency in sacral ganglia are expressed as arithmetic mean SEM of the log10 transformed number of CpHV-1 genomes. log2 serum anti-CpHV-1 IgG1 and IgG2 titers (within the same vaccine group) were analyzed by the Students' t-test. p value less than 0.05 was considered significant. goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59TM showed average VN titers (log2 3.42) which were 4- to 8-fold higher than those of nave goats. a double asterisk denotes probability, p, 0.001 that the VN titers (A) or the serum IgG titers (B) or the vaginal IgG titers (C) were equivalent to those of nave goat titers in goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59TM were compared to those of goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1. titers increased in goats immunized with CpHV-1-only but reached average titers (log2 21) that were only 2-fold higher than those of nave goats. 20 post-immunizations were 64-fold higher than those of nave goats. goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59TM developed significant titers of serum IgG specific to CpHV-1 (log2 160.5) titers were approximately 64-fold higher than titers measured in goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 only. a total of 8 goats in the nave group, 8 goats in the inactivated CpHV-1 only vaccinated group and 12 goats in the inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59TM vaccinated group. a single asterisk (*) denotes probability that the serum IgG1 titers are equivalent to the serum IgG2 titers in goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59TM showed low titers of vaginal IgG (log2 10.5) administration of second vaccine dose resulted in significantly elevated titers of CpHV-1-specific vaginal IgG (log2 41) on day 20 post immunization, CpHV-1-specific vaginal IgG remained undetectable in goats vaccinated with inactivated CpH PBMC isolated from goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59TM did not produce detectable levels of IFN-gamma upon antigen-stimulation in vitro. the profile of IFN-gamma and IL-4 secretion by PBMC isolated from goats was studied in culture supernatants after CpHV-1 stimulation. soluble IFN-gamma in culture supernatants was measured by ELISA (A) and frequencies of IFN-gamma Spot Forming Cells (SFC) were measured by ELISPOT (B) data are cumulative from 4 independent experiments performed as described in Materials and Methods. a total of 8 goats in the nave group, a total of 8 goats in the inactivated CpHV-1 only vaccinated group and a total of 12 goats inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59TM vaccine reduces viral replication. all goats were vaginally infected with 4 ml of virulent CpHV-1 suspension. nave goats shed titers of challenge virus that reached maximum levels by day 6. vaginal shedding was not detected by the standard cell-culture test in any goat vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59TM. the shedding of challenge virus in goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59TM was statistically different from that of nave goats and from that of goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 only. in (A), (B) and (C) the double asterisk denotes probability, p, 0.001 that the clinical scores in goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 only were equivalent to nave goats. the same probability, p, 0.001 was observed when the CpHV-1 shedding titers (A) or the number of CpHV-1 genomes (B) or the clinical scores (C) in goats vaccinated with the number of CpHV-1 genomes increased from day 1 to day 6 post challenge for nave goats. the number of CpHV-1 genomes progressively decreased from day 7 to day 14 post challenge. in these same groups of goats, the number of CpHV-1 genomes progressively decreased from day 7 to day 14 post challenge. in goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59TM, the infectious challenge virus was undetectable by the standard cell-culture test from day 1 to day 14 post challenge. this was probably due to neutralization of the virus (whose genome was detected) by the antigen-specific vaginal antibodies. differences in the level of vaginal CpHV-1 genomes on day 1 post challenge could be due to the immune responses induced by the adjuvanted vaccine that could IFN-gamma producing cells were detected at similar levels in goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59TM. the frequency of IFN-gamma producing cells remained stable before and after vaginal challenge in goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59TM. all goats were challenged vaginally two weeks after the second vaccination. blood was drawn three weeks post-challenge and PBMC were stimulated in vitro. a similar trend was observed in all five pairs of sacral ganglia isolated from nave goats. the amount and distribution of latent CpHV-1 in sacral ganglia do not appear to be related to the severity of the clinical signs of disease following challenge [23] a double asterisk denotes probability, p, 0.001 that the number of CpHV-1 genomes in the third (or fourth) pair of ganglia of goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59TM was equivalent to nave goats. in nave goats, the latent CpHV-1 genomes were most abundantly found in the second, third and fourth pair of sacral ganglia. in four out of six goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59TM, the CpHV-1 genome was undetectable in all five pairs of sacral ganglia. the remaining two goats had detectable latent CpHV-1 DNA in one single ganglion. goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 only were used as controls. nave goats served as background controls. goats showed a variable VN antibody response to CpHV-1. serum VN titers (A) or ELISA serum IgG titers (B) or ELISA vaginal IgG titers (C) data reported are cumulative from 4 independent experiments performed as described in Materials and Methods. a total of 8 goats in the nave group, a total of 8 goats in the inactivated CpHV-1 only vaccinated group and a total of 12 goats in the inactivated CpHV-1 goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59TM developed significantly elevated VN titers (log2 7.40.5) on day 20. goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59TM developed significantly elevated VN titers (log2 7.40.5) on day 20. goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59TM developed significant titers of serum IgG goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59TM produced low titers of both IgG1 and IgG2 subclasses. goats exhibited titers of serum IgG1 (log2 12.80.4) that were an average 256-fold higher than nave goats and titers of serum IgG2 (log2 14.30.5) that were an average 512-fold higher than those of nave goats. a single asterisk (*) denotes probability that the serum IgG1 titers are equivalent to the serum IgG2 titers in goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59TM. the levels of CpHV-1-specific serum IgA were also studied by ELISA and they were undetectable at all time points tested. specific vaginal IgG in goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59TM was an average 16-fold higher than those of nave goats. on day 20 post immunization, CpHV-1-specific vaginal IgG remained undetectable in goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59TM. the level of VN activity in vaginal washes from all vaccinated goat goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59TM exhibited significant levels of soluble IFN-gamma. these levels were approximately 150-fold higher than those of either nave goats or goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 only (5 pg/ml) in the same cultures, IL-4 was always undetectable in response to CpHV-1 stimulation. soluble IFN-gamma levels (A) or IFN-gamma SFC (B) in goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59TM were equivalent to nave goats. the same probability, p, 0.001 was observed when soluble IFN-gamma levels (A) were compared to those of goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 only. goats were vaginally infected and used as unvaccinated controls. from day 1 to day 14 post challenge, goats immunized with inactivated CpHV-1 only. nave goats shed titers of challenge virus that were not significantly different. all goats were challenged vaginally two weeks following the second vaccination as described in Materials and Methods. goats were monitored daily for 14 days post-challenge and vaginal swabs were collected daily. inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59TM were compared to those of nave goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 only. the clinical scores in goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 were equivalent to those of nave goats. in nave goats, the CpHV-1 DNA remained detectable on day 13 and 14 post challenge. a different vaginal CpHV-1 genome profile was observed in goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59TM. a decreasing number of CpHV-1 genomes was detected from day 1 to day 11 post challenge. the differences in the level of vaginal CpHV-1 genomes on day 1 post challenge could be due to the immune responses induced by the adjuvanted vaccine that could interfere with virus replication. clinical scores were recorded after the vaginal challenge to monitor the clinical efficacy of the vaccine formulations. IFN-gamma producing cells were detected at similar levels in goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 only (175 IFN-gamma SFC/106 PBMC) and nave goats (188 IFN-gamma SFC/106 PBMC) the frequencies of IFN-gamma producing cells in goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59TM were significantly higher than those observed in nave goats. a single asterisk denotes probability that the IFN-gamma SFC in goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59TM were equivalent to those of nave goats. the same probability, p, 0.05 was observed when IFN-gamma SFC in goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59TM were compared to those of goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 all goats were challenged vaginally two weeks following the second vaccination with 4 ml of virulent CpHV-1 suspension (105 TCID50/50 l) the five pairs of sacral ganglia were excised one month after challenge, the DNA was extracted from individual ganglion to detect and quantitate the number of CpHV-1 genomes by real-time PCR. nave goats, the latent CpHV-1 genomes were most abundantly found in the second, third and fourth pair of sacral ganglia. they were approximately 1,500 times, 1,000,000 times, and 3,500 times above the limit of detection of the real-time PCR assay for the second, the third and the fourth ganglia. in nave goats, CpHV-1 genomes were detected in 3 out of 12 first sacral ganglia. in four out of six goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59TM, the CpHV-1 genome was undetectable in all five pairs of sacral ganglia. the remaining two goats had detectable latent CpHV-1 DNA in one single ganglion. the vaccine-induced immune responses were protective as they reduced the replication of challenge virus in the genital mucosa to undetectable levels. MF59TM is able to increase immunogenicity of several types of antigens. it promotes both antibody and cell-mediated immune responses. it is licensed for human use in the eu and is a component of seasonal and pandemic injectable human flu-vaccines. the presence of Ag-specific IgG in the preferential site of entry of CpHV-1 would provide a first line of defense against infection that could be further implemented by the physiologic increase in serum transudation. serum antibodies specific to HSV have been shown to neutralize herpesviruses at the axon terminus/synapses. the results from the present study seem to extend this observation also to CpHV-1. in goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59TM, CpHV-1-specific vaginal IgG and IFN-gamma production are associated with protective immunity against vaginal CpHV-1 infection. ii) only female goats were vaccinated; ii) only female goats were vaccinated. future studies should employ larger numbers of animals of both sexes. this is the first study showing that MF59TM in goats."}
