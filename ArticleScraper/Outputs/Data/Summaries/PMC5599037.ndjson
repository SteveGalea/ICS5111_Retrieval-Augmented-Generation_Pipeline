{"summary": "nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from cases and controls. pneumococcal density was quantified by lytA real-time polymerase-chain reaction. nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from cases and controls. gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae), a frequent colonizer of the child\u2019s nasopharynx, remains one of the major killers of children globally despite extensive pneumococcal vaccination programs [1\u20133] colonizing pneumococci spread from their nasopharyngeal niche to normally sterile body sites and cause potentially life-threatening invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) culture in non-invasive samples collected from the upper respiratory tract has been proposed as a candidate surrogate marker to discriminate from asymptomatic carriage. we aimed to determine whether pneumococcal load quantified with a lytA real-time PCR in NP aspirates taken from a rural pediatric population could be a marker of IPD. variables recorded in cases and controls included patient age, sex, height, weight, weight-for-age z (WAZ) score, nutritional status, recruitment season, co-infection with HIV or malaria, NP carriage (lytA positivity), NP serotype identification, serotype invasiveness potential. children with a weight-for-age z-score with a dispersion -1SD were considered to be undernourished. Frozen samples were shipped to hospital Sant Joan de D\u00e9u and Hospital Clinic, both in Barcelona (spain), where pneumococcal and respiratory virus studies were conducted. a duplex real-time PCR targeting the lytA gene of S. pneumoniae and the internal control targeting RNaseP of human cells were performed. patients with indistinguishable serotypes were excluded from the analysis of pneumococcal co-colonization. patients with indistinguishable serotypes were considered non-invasive for studying invasiveness potential. the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) was the parameter used to select the most accurate predictive model and determine the optimal cut-off value of NP pneumococcal load that maximizes sensitivity and specificity. Statistical significance was set at a p-value of 0.05 and confidence intervals (CI) at 95% level. a NP aspirate was collected for both cases and controls to determine pneumococcal load and respiratory viral infection. two asymptomatic controls for IPD of the same age (+/-3 months) and sex were randomly selected in the community for each case from the DSS databases, and recruited during the period September-November 2012. NP specimens were collected using NPAK\u00ae kits (M-Pro, Michigan, US) they were processed into aliquots (obtained by injecting a small 2\u20133 mL amount of physiological saline, and then aspirating) and immediately frozen at -80\u00b0C. non-detectable serotypes by this technique were classified as indistinguishable serotypes. patients with indistinguishable serotypes were excluded from the analysis of pneumococcal co-colonization. DNA was amplified with the Applied Biosystems 7500 real-time PCR System. genome-copy number is less variable than colony forming unit (CFU) on of influenza A, B, C, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, coronavirus, enterovirus, human parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, 3, 4, human metapneumovirus was performed according to previously published studies. HIV-infection was confirmed when necessary by an HIV-1 DNA Amplicor test. thick and thin blood films were processed and examined according to standard methods for malaria diagnosis. a total of 30 IPD patients and 60 healthy controls were included in the study. males predominated in both groups (70%) the difference in median age between cases (12.8 months) and controls (11.7 months) was minor (p = 0.37). 42 (70.0) 1.00 Recruitment during dry season 16 (53.3) 26 (43.3) 0.37 Recruitment during the pre-vaccine era 25 (83.3) 60 (100.0) 0.003 Weight, kg, Md (IQR) 8.1 (6.1\u201310.0) 8.8 (8.0\u201311.1) 0.06 Underweight, WAZ -1SD 21 (70.0) 25 (41.7) 0.01 Data expressed in No. (%), unless otherwise specified. s identified in cases were 7C/(7B/40) (27.3%), 5 (10.6%), 6A/B (9.1%), and 23F (9.1%), whereas for controls, serotype 6A/B predominated (19.7%), followed by 19F/C/B (14.8.%), 7C/(7B/40) (13.1%) and 14 (11.5%) no significant differences were found in median platelet (PLT) and white blood cell (WBC) counts. table 2 describes results of laboratory microbiological and hematological tests in the two groups. human rhinovirus 10/30 (33.3) 15/60 (25.0) 0.41 Adenovirus 4/30 (13.3) 1/60 (1.7) 0.02a Influenza virus 1/30 (3.3) 0/60 (0.0) 0.16a Parainfluenza virus 1/30 (3.3) 1/60 (1.7) 0.60a Hb level, g/L, Md (IQR)* (cases: n = 29; controls: n = 57) 23.5 (21.5\u201329 NP pneumococcal load quantified by lytA real-time PCR, NP pneumococci co-colonization, invasive serotypes, underweight, and Hb and HCT markers were significantly associated with IPD. a fair diagnostic accuracy was observed for serotype invasiveness (AUC-ROC: 71.3%, 95% CI 61.6%-81.8%), pneumococcal co-colonization (AUC-ROC the adjusted odds ratio for IPD per log unit increase of NP pneumococcal load was 8.06 (95% CI 1.57\u201341.41, p = 0.01) in this model.

NP pneumococcal carriage was highly prevalent in both groups. cases were more extensively colonized by invasive serotypes 1, 5 and 7F/A (46.4% vs. 3.8%, p0.001). the mean NP pneumococcal load of cases recruited after the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine did not substantially differ from that of cases recruited in the pre-vaccine period (6.8 log10 copies/mL vs. 7.1 log10 copies/mL, p = 0.52) half of the cases (50%) tested positive for HIV. p valuea,b NP pneumococcal carriage 28/30 (93.3) 53/60 (88.3) 0.71a NP lytA real-time PCR load, log10 cp/mL, mean (SD) 7.0 (0.9) 5.8 (1.0) 0.001 NP pneumococcus serotype high invasiveness potential 13/28 (46.4) 2/53 (3.8) 0.001 NP colonization with one serotype 4/28 0.16a Parainfluenza virus 1/30 (3.3) 1/60 (1.7) 0.60a Hb level, g/L, Md (IQR)* (cases: n = 29; controls: n = 57) 23.5 (21.5\u201329.4) 31.0 (28.6\u201333.5) 0.001b PLT, 103 cell/mm3, Md (IQR)* (cases: n = 29; controls: n = 57) 421 NP pneumococcal load showed good discriminatory power between cases and controls. a colonization density of 6.5 log10 copies/mL was determined to be the optimal cut-off value to distinguish cases from controls. a fair diagnostic accuracy was observed for serotype invasiveness. results of univariate and multivariate analysis are presented in Table 3. Table 3. Factors associated with IPD. NP pneumococcal load discriminated with moderately high sensitivity (75%) and specificity (73.6%) between cases and controls. the idea of such a discriminating threshold is not new and has previously been explored for diverse pneumococcal conditions. sputum lytA real-time PCR was used to discriminate HIV-infected adults with pneumococcal pneumonia from controls. sensitivity and specificity values were slightly lower for NP aspirates and 4.5 log10 copies/mL for sputum measured by quantitative lytA real-time PCR in an elder Swedish pneumonia cohort. a new biomarker, NP pneumococcal DNA load may allow designing point-of-care tests capable of quantifying bacterial load in a simple manner. the results of the multivariate analysis suggest that the adoption of a holistic approach by combining quantification of NP pneumococcal load with serotype identification could substantially increase overall diagnostic yield. in controls was unknown but we have no reason to suspect that it could be considerably different from that reported for healthy children in the same community. a low NP pneumococcal load in a range of 3\u20135% has been documented. this suggests that this factor does not substantially increase NP density of pneumococcus in young patients."}
