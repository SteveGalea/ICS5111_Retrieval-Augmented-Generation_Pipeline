{"summary": "more than 1300 species of bats belong to the order Chiroptera. the Yinpterochiroptera suborder includes the non-echolocating Pteropodidae family. the echolocating Rhinolophoidea superfamily contains the remaining microbat families. coronaviruses are enveloped and have single stranded positive sense RNA genomes. the genome encodes a variety of structural, non-structural and accessory proteins. the accessory proteins vary between coronaviruses, even within the same clade, and perform a variety of functions including antagonism of the host response following infection. tis virus (IBV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and more recently, swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) many of these human and animal coronaviruses appear to have origins in a variety of bat species. human to human transmission resulted in a global SARS epidemic which lasted 8 months. the role of bats as the original animal reservoir hosts of SARS-CoV was speculated as similar viruses were detected in them. dromedary camels are a natural reservoir host for MERS-CoV. in the Arabian Peninsula and across northern Africa, the seroprevalence rate for MERS-CoV in dromedary camels ranges from 70% to nearly 100%. a recent study found 16 out of 30 camel workers surveyed in Saudi Arabia show evidence of prior MERS-CoV infection via seroconversion. HCoV-NL63 was first identified in a pediatric patient with bronchiolitis in 2004. since then it has come to be appreciated that the virus causes approximately 1\u20139% of the common colds each year. HCoV-NL63-like sequences were also identified in bats in africa. a novel alphacoronavirus was identified in an outbreak of respiratory disease in alpacas in the us in 2007. it is geographically separated from the bat species that harbor HCoV-229E-like viruses in africa. full genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the alpaca CoV placed it as an intermediate between the bat HCoV-229E-related viruses and HCoV-229E from humans. PEDV is more closely related to a Scotophilus bat coronavirus (BtCoV) 512/2005 than to other known alphacoronaviruses. this finding suggests that PEDV and BtCoV/512/2005 have a common evolutionary precursor. 98% similarity to SADS-CoV were detected in 9.8% of the bats. none of the human serum samples that were collected from farm workers were positive for antibodies against SADS-CoV. further studies will be required to confirm the ability of SADS-CoV to infect and propagate in human cells. opositive patients responded more strongly against the SARS-like-CoV isolated from a palm civet compared to the human SARS-CoV isolate [31] low levels of human exposure to zoonotic SARS-like CoV occurred prior to the SARS-CoV epidemic that began in 2002. dromedary camels are a natural reservoir host for MERS-CoV. HCoV-NL63 was first identified in a pediatric patient with bronchiolitis in 2004. since then it has come to be appreciated that the virus causes approximately 1\u20139% of the common colds each year. human coronaviruses that cause the common cold are also thought to have their origins in bats. HCoV-229E-related viruses have been found in hipposiderid bats. in 2007, a novel alphacoronavirus was identified in an outbreak of respiratory disease in alpacas in the us. it is geographically separated from the bat species that harbor HCoV-229E-like viruses in africa. PEDV is more closely related to a Scotophilus bat coronavirus (BtCoV) 512/2005 than to other known alphacoronaviruses. PEDV has since emerged in north America and continues to cause periodic outbreaks that significantly affect producers. no clinical cases of PEDV have been reported in humans so far. pigs in china caused the death of 24,693 piglets across four farms. none of the human serum samples that were collected from farm workers were positive for antibodies against SADS-CoV. this means that SADS-CoV does not pose a risk for human transmission yet. the increase in virus replication may enhance the chances of a virus spillover. similar ecological studies need to be undertaken for bats and CoVs. other stressors, such as secondary infections, may also affect the relationship between bats and their viruses. bats are known to harbor a wide variety of coronaviruses, but the mechanisms for virus spillover into humans or livestock are widely unknown. bats are known to harbor a wide range of coronaviruses, but the mechanisms for virus spillover into humans or livestock are widely unknown. a variety of studies have been performed that evaluate the bat immune response to virus infections at the genomics level, in vitro using cell culture systems, and performing experimental infections in vivo. the primary bat species being used to study the bat immune response to virus infections in vitro and in vivo are Pteropus alecto (black flying fox), Rousettus aegyptiacus (egyptian rousette), and Artibeus jamaicen work has been done to characterize many of these genes in cell lines derived from various bat species including P. alecto [79,80,81] cytokines, chemokines, and interferon-related genes were detected, while genes encoding for natural killer (NK) cell receptors were absent. studies show that bat cells respond to RNA and induce an antiviral response. many viruses encode proteins that antagonize the host response to infection and dampen the innate antiviral response. many viruses encode proteins that antagonize the host response to infection. systems using whole genome sequence from CoVs isolated from bats could be generated, propagated and evaluated in both bat and human cell lines. this would allow researchers to better understand the role of viral proteins in a species-specific context. only two studies have been performed looking at the in vivo response of bats to virus infection. the authors detected virus shedding in the respiratory and intestinal tracts for 9 days. no overt signs of disease were observed. a moderate and transient induction of the innate immune response was seen. the primary bat species being used to study the bat immune response to virus infections in vitro and in vivo are Pteropus alecto (black flying fox), Rousettus aegyptiacus (egyptian rousette), and Artibeus jamaicensis (Jamaican fruit bat) Papenfuss et al. were the first to sequence the P. alecto transcriptome and identified approximately 500 genes that different species of bats may have evolved specific strategies to control viruses. RNA sensing and subsequent antiviral responses in bat cells have been studied using viruses known to induce an interferon response. multiple studies with PEDV, SARS- and MERS-CoVs have identified accessory proteins that can effectively inhibit an IFN response in mammalian cells. however, to date, there have been no published studies looking at the role of these accessory proteins in modulating antiviral responses in bat cells. the first study was performed in an attempt to rescue a bat CoV isolate. the authors reported that this bat CoV replicates in Leschenault rousette bats. no clinical disease was observed. several MERS-like viruses have been detected in bats since the study in Jamaican fruit bats. none have been successfully isolated [25,41,47,99]. a recent study showed that secondary infection with the white-nose syndrome fungus (Pseudogymnoascus destructans) increases CoV replication in M. lucifugus [71]. this study opens up a new avenue of investigation in infection dynamics."}
