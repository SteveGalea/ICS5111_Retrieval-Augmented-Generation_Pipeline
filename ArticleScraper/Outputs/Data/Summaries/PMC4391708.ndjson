{"summary": "the studies on HAdV infection among children with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) are limited. 76 (13.8%) of 552 SARI patients were positive for HAdV. HAdV co-infection with other respiratory viruses was frequent. HAdVs are classified into 7 species (Human mastadenovirus A to G) and at least 69 recognized genotypes based on serology, whole-genome sequencing, and phylogenetic analyses. HAdVs have been recognised as pathogens that cause a broad spectrum of diseases [1, 2], including acute respiratory infection (ARI), gastroenteritis, conjunctivitis, cystitis, and meningoencephalitis. study population and specimens We defined a case of SARI according to the world health organisation case definition for all hospitalised children in whom the onset of illness occurred within 7 days of admission. two separate banks of specimens between May 2007 and March 2010 were used in this investigation. PCR reactions contained 1.25 U FastStart Taq DNA Polymerase, 10 PCR Buffer with 2 mM MgCl2. 0.5 M of each primer, 200 M of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate (i.e., dATP, dGTP, dCTP, dTTP; TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan) phylogenetic tree and typing The partial hexon gene sequences have been deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers KM377987-KM378038 and KM877524-KM877547. a total of 28 prototype reference sequences of HAdV used for comparison with sequences from this study were obtained from GenBank (S1 Table) nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens collected from paediatric patients with SARI in Beijing (Northern China) the second specimen bank comprised 293 induced sputum specimens from paediatric patients with SARI in Zhejiang Province (Eastern China) PCR conditions comprised an initial denaturation step at 94\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 36 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 1 min, annealing at 50\u00b0C for 1 min, and extension at 72\u00b0C for 7 min. the final step was an extension at 72\u00b0C for 7 min. phylogenetic tree and typing The partial hexon gene sequences have been deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers KM377987-KM378038 and KM877524-KM877547. a total of 28 prototype reference sequences of HAdV used for comparison with sequences from this study were obtained from GenBank (S1 Table) 52 20.1 24 8.2 0.0001 in total, 76 (13.8%) of 552 SARI patients were positive for HAdV. most of the HAdV infections occurred in children aged 6 months to 2 years. seasonal distribution indicated most of the HAdV-B infections occurred during the winter and spring. phylogenetic tree was built based on alignment of nucleotide sequences of amplicons of HAdV and relevant prototype sequences from GenBank. HAdV-B and HAdV-C were the most prevalent among four seasons. HAdV-C was predominant among the strains from Eastern China with HAdV-1 (n = 5), HAdV-2 (n = 8), HAdV-5 (n = 6), and HAdV-6 (n = 1). HAdV-B also contained several strains from Eastern China with HAdV-3 (n = 2) and HAdV-7 (n = 1), and HAdV-4 (HAdV-E). dV-2 (n = 9) 1 (1.9) 8 (33.3) HAdV-5 (n = 8) 2 (3.8) 6 (25.0) HAdV-6 (n = 3) 2 (3.8) 1 (4.2) HAdV-2/6 (n = 5) 5 (9.6) 7 (29.2) 0.0298 Co-infection (n = 64) 47 (90.4) 17 (70.8) with RSV (n = 37) 32 (61.5) 5 (20.8) 0.0057 Demographic, typing and clinical profiles with single HAdV infection are shown in Table 5. dominant types for single HAdV infection were HAdV-7 (3 cases), HAdV-1 (3 cases) and HAdV-2 (2 cases). analysis of clinical records, the clinical manifestation of the patients with HAdV infection included fever, cough, and sputum. a few cases showed signs of a runny nose, nasal congestion, and gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea and vomiting. the prevalence of HAdV infection is higher than that of HAdV infection alone. the seasonal distribution indicated that most of the HAdV-B infections occurred during the winter and spring (Table 2). however, no season variation was shown for HAdV-C infections in this study. the phylogenetic tree was built based on alignment of the nucleotide sequences of the amplicons of HAdV and the relevant prototype sequences from GenBank. HAdV-B and HAdV-7 were the most prevalent among the strains isolated from northern China. phylogenetic tree was constructed by neighbour-joining method. bootstrap values were determined by 1000 replications in MEGA5.0. genome profiles and co-infection of HAdV.
