{"summary": "viral vaccines have been instrumental in the worldwide eradication of smallpox and rinderpest, the elimination of polio within much of the developed world, and the effective control of many other diseases. many infectious diseases cannot yet be controlled or eradicated through vaccination programmes, either because an effective vaccine has not yet been developed (as with HIV) or because it is impossible to vaccinate a sufficient proportion of the population to guarantee herd immunity. the most obvious and significant risk posed by a live transmissible vaccine is the potential for increased virulence to evolve. the risk of reversion to high virulence can be minimized by genetically engineering transmissible vaccines using techniques that impede evolution. the safest implementation would also engineer the vaccine so that it can transmit only weakly (R0 1). the model Our model assumes populations are large and well mixed. we assume hosts are either susceptible to the disease and vaccine (S), infected by the vaccine (V), infected by the disease (W) or immune/resistant to both vaccine and disease (R) the fractional reduction in vaccination threshold arising from use of a transmissible vaccine is given by 3.1. the quantities R0,W and R0,V are the basic reproductive numbers for the infectious disease and vaccine, respectively. the closer the R0 of the vaccine to that of the disease, the greater the reduction in direct vaccination effort required for disease eradication. 3.2 where is the fraction of newborns directly vaccinated and less than the critical value guaranteeing disease eradication given by equation (A 5). the key implication of (3.2) is that even weakly transmissible vaccines can significantly reduce the incidence of an infectious disease. a modestly transmissible vaccine (R0 = 0.93) resulted in the eradication of this disease in 99.9% of simulations (999 of 1000 simulations), in cases where our analytical results predicted eradication. simulations showed vaccine transmission reduced the number of infected individuals by 61.8%. reductions in disease incidence caused by the transmissible vaccine result in a high probability of disease eradication even before the critical threshold of vaccine transmission is reached. the reason disease eradication occurs prior to reaching the eradication threshold is that vaccine transmission reduces the number of individuals infected with the disease sufficiently for stochastic extinction. a weakly transmissible vaccine has some potential to revert to wild-type virulence. this is particularly true for live, attenuated vaccines developed using traditional methods that adapted a virus to unnatural conditions. this is particularly true for live, attenuated vaccines developed using traditional methods that adapted a virus to unnatural conditions in the hope that growth in the focal host would decline. a recombinant transmissible vaccine has been developed to protect wild rabbit populations against myxomatosis. similar approaches could be used to develop transmissible vaccines against invasive wildlife diseases, such as west Nile virus [27], to protect threatened wildlife populations from infectious disease [28] or to eliminate diseases like rabies from wild reservoir populations. authors' contributions J.J.B., R.A., B.M.A. and S.L.N. conceived of the study. all authors gave final approval for publication."}
