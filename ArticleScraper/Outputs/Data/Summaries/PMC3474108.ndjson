{"summary": "results The most common CT findings in patients with S-OIV infection are ground-glass opacities with or without consolidation at the first week. abnormalities peaked at the second week and resolved after that time, which resulted in substantial reduced residual disease. 38 of these patients were confirmed to have S-OIV (H1N1) by testing respiratory specimens with real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) group 1 consisted of 29 critically ill patients. group 2 consisted of 41 patients who required brief hospitalisation without advanced mechanical ventilation but were administered drugs. bronchiectasis, irregular linear opacities, interfaces and traction bronchiectasis were considered evidence of probable fibrosis. the presence of parenchymal bands, irregular linear opacities and interfaces was considered evidence of probable fibrosis. each lung zone (total of six lung zones) was assigned a score based on 0 when no involvement, 1 when 25% involvement, 2 when 25\u201350% involvement and 4 when >75% involvement. p-value 0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. group 2 consisted of 41 patients who required brief hospitalisation without advanced mechanical ventilation. CT techniques Thin-section MSCT was performed for all 70 patients on a 10-slice scanner (Sensation 10; Siemens Healthcare, Munich, Germany) consolidation was defined as homogeneous opacification of the parenchyma. nodular opacities were defined as linear opacities forming a mesh-like pattern. air trapping was defined as an area of low attenuation. a p-value 0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. differences in the two groups were tested by using 2 statistics. smooth intralobular lines, reticular opacities, mild traction bronchiectasis, parenchymal bands, irregular linear opacities and interfaces were noted in the first week after onset of symptoms. by the second week, the greatest number of smooth intralobular lines and other superimposed reticular opacities were noted in association with GGOs. transverse CT scan obtained on day 4 of illness shows ground-glass opacities (GGOs) with bilateral areas of consolidation in mid and lower lung zones. 4 (5.5%) of the 70 patients developed pneumomediastinum that was only evident on high-resolution CT. serial thin-section CT scans obtained between the time of initial and final scans were obtained in 56 patients. the final CT findings showed most of these patients had improved. the disease extent was greater in group 1 patients requiring advanced mechanical ventilation at the time of the initial CT scan. reticulation superimposed on GGOs persisted, although reduced in extent. arrows suggestive of air trapping in the ventral and subpleural lung regions. the most common pattern observed in initial CT scans was GGOs alone in Group 2 patients (51.2%; 21/41) and GGOs with superimposed consolidation in Group 1 patients (62.9%; 18/29) by the second week, the greatest number of smooth intralobular lines and other superimposed reticular opacities were noted in association with GGOs. Scan obtained on day 7 of illness shows diffuse peripheral distribution of ground-glass opacities (GGOs) transverse thin-section CT scans in 34-year-old pregnant female with laboratory-confirmed swine-origin influenza A. Scan obtained on day 40 of illness shows that GGOs were resolved, but air trapping persisted. 4 (5.5%) of the 70 patients developed pneumomediastinum that was only evident on high-resolution CT. 15 (21%) of the 70 patients had small bilateral or unilateral pleural effusions. Scan obtained on day 4 of illness shows a peripheral distribution of patchy ground-glass opacities (GGOs) with progression of symptoms, he was admitted to the intensive care unit on the sixth day of illness for mechanical ventilation. he was admitted to the intensive care unit on the sixth day of illness for mechanical ventilation. the estimated marginal means of CT score peaked at week 2 of illness in both groups, with a slow decline thereafter. the most common clinical symptoms at presentation are fever, cough, dyspnoea and respiratory distress. the most common clinical symptoms at presentation are fever, cough, dyspnoea and respiratory distress. pneumonia foci with intra-alveolar exudates without evidence of bacterial colonies. tracheitis and bronchitis, focal squamous metaplasia, and submucosal inflammatory infiltrates have also been reported. the intermediate stage begins in the second week and is a transitional period. it is believed that pulmonary fibrosis observed at the recovery phase would account for the respiratory symptoms. it may be difficult to distinguish diffuse alveolar damage caused by H1N1 infections from that caused by other micro-organisms, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), coronavirus (SARS-CoV) or avian influenza A (H5N1). long-term follow-up imaging of survivors shows gradual decrease of GGO and reticulation, with persistent air trapping in some patients. the latter is evidence of small airway disease that cannot be detected on CT scans at the onset of the disease [26]. the most common MDCT findings in patients with S-OIV infection are unilateral or bilateral GGOs with or without associated focal or multifocal areas of consolidation. the most common MDCT findings in patients with S-OIV infection are unilateral or bilateral GGOs with or without associated focal or multifocal areas of consolidation."}
