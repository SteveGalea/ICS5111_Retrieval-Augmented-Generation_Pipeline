{"summary": "Intracellular pathogens are responsible for an overwhelming amount of morbidity and mortality worldwide. successful dissemination of many of these pathogens requires complex life cycles that involve survival and replication in environmental or vector niches. the pathogens establish a variety of unique intracellular niches that are essential for their pathogenesis. PrfA-mediated gene expression is regulated by PrfA abundance, affinity for target promoters, and activation via cofactor binding. most distal is a PrfA-dependent read-through transcript that is essential for appropriately high levels of intracellular gene expression [10\u201312]. a genetic system was designed to select for mutants that failed to express ActA intracellularly. this screen led to the identification of L. monocytogenes glutathione synthase (GshF) and glutathione, a tripeptide antioxidant, as the allosteric activator of PrfA. suicide strain grew like wild type in rich media but was unrecoverable after infection of bone marrow-derived macrophages. a himar1 transposon library was then constructed in the suicide strain background and used to infect BMMs. nearly all mutants harbored transposon insertions in cre, actA promoter driving cre expression (actA1p), loxP sites, and gshF, encoding glutathione synthase. 11 insertions in the actA promoter driving cre and 31 insertions in the loxP sites were identified. the remaining transposon mutations were transduced into a wild type background and analyzed in a plaque assay. the remaining transposon mutations were transduced into a wild type background. female CD-1 mice were infected with 105 colony forming units (CFU) of each mutant. Spleens were harvested 48 hours post-infection. data represent three pooled experiments totaling n = 15 mice per strain. deoR family transcriptional regulator 84.28 1.36 93.6 6.7 P-lmo2191 b spxA1 ArsC family transcriptional regulator 75.22 1.52 107.0 4.4 lmo2199 ohrA hypothetical protein (peroxiredoxin, OsmC/Ohr family) 79.44 1.25 100.6 5.9 lmo2250 arpJ polar amino acid ABC transporter 47.90 0.82 60.6 2.0 l twelve mutants isolated by genetic selection were identified based on in vitro assays for virulence. the importance of these genes to L. monocytogenes pathogenesis was confirmed in a murine model of infection. mutants exhibited phenotypes consistent with published pplA defects. other reports have identified genes necessary for virulence of L. monocytogenes. it remains to be investigated if the activity of these genes is regulated post-transcriptionally in response to the host. lmo2200 encodes a hypothetical protein with a peroxiredoxin domain. it is co-transcribed with lmo2200, encoding a marR family transcriptional regulator. this suggests that Lmo2200 may act as a transcriptional repressor. gshF suppressor mutations increased the virulence of a gshF mutant. mice were serially infected with a high-inoculum of gshF. livers were harvested at 72 hours p.i., homogenized, and diluted to inoculate mice. these results did not directly implicate any of the other genes identified in our genetic selection. but these findings did highlight the impact of both PrfA abundance and activation during infection. pplA::Tn formed 100% plaques in both the P2 and PrfA* backgrounds. the mutant was deficient in expression of PrfA-dependent genes required early during infection before cytosolic access and glutathione-mediated activation of PrfA. p values were calculated using a heteroscedastic Student\u2019s t-test ** p 0.01; *** p 0.001. the mean s.e.m. of at least three independent experiments. mutations in P-spxA1, ohrA, and pplA resulted in aberrant LLO secretion and/or that these mutants were unable to survive in the harsh environment of the vacuole. we tried to segregate these two possibilities by analyzing sensitivity to vacuolar conditions. hly restored the majority of the plaque defect for P-spxA1::Tn and ohrA::Tn. however, it did not restore the plaque to 100% of the parent strain. mutants may also be impaired in the ability to grow in the host cytosol, independently from virulence gene expression. arpJ may contribute to glutathione-dependent transcriptional activation of actA. for panels A and B, data are the mean s.e.m. of at least three independent experiments. the actA gene is preceded by 149 nucleotides of untranslated mRNA. the actA gene is preceded by 149 nucleotides of untranslated mRNA. this is important for sufficient ActA expression [21]. actA gene and 5\u2019 UTR were moved to a neutral locus within the L. monocytogenes chromosome. this strain was called actA1p and was only mildly impaired in plaque formation and virulence. however, actA1p yjbH::Tn was unable to form a plaque. the suicide strain grew like wild type in rich media but was unrecoverable after infection of bone marrow-derived macrophages. a himar1 transposon library was then constructed in the suicide strain background. nearly all mutants harbored transposon insertions in cre, the actA promoter driving cre expression (actA1p), loxP sites, and gshF, encoding glutathione synthase. 11 insertions in the actA promoter driving cre and 31 insertions in the loxP sites were identified. the remaining transposon mutations were transduced into a wild type background and analyzed in a plaque assay. the remaining transposon mutations were transduced into a wild type background. female CD-1 mice were infected with 105 colony forming units (CFU) of each mutant.

YjbH, Spx, OhrA, and GshF have defined roles in maintaining redox homeostasis in the presence of disulfide and organic peroxide stresses in Firmicutes. YjbH-bound Spx is recognized by the ClpXP protease and is degraded so that Spx concentrations are low under steady-state conditions. gshF mutants are more sensitive to redox stressors such as hydrogen peroxide and diamide. gshF mutants are fully virulent in L. monocytogenes harboring prfA* mutations that lock PrfA in its constitutively active conformation. host-derived glutathione activates virulence gene expression in burkholderia pseudomallei. reactive nitrogen species (RNS) are produced in the phagosome and once in the host cytosol, L. monocytogenes is confronted with RES and mitochondrial-derived ROS. it is possible that the bacterial response to the redox stresses is also compartmentalized, requiring specific factors in the vacuole and host cytosol. glycerol is the principle carbon source used by L. monocytogenes intracellularly. growth on glycerol is a well-described stimulant of methylglyoxal production. methylglyoxal stress stimulates the Spx regulon and production of bacillithiol. this would further link metabolism of an alternative carbon source to virulence. the complexity of actA activation is likely the result of selective pressure to respond appropriately to host-derived cues. the complexity of actA activation is likely the result of selective pressure to respond appropriately to host-derived cues. redox cues are a mechanism by which intracellular pathogens recognize the host. all L. monocytogenes strains were cultivated shaking in LB (Miller) at 37\u00b0C. all E. coli strains are listed in Table 2 and all L. monocytogenes strains are listed in Table 3.
