{"summary": "paramyxoviruses include respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV) and human metapneumovirus (MPV), which may cause significant respiratory tract infectious disease (RTID) but clinical data regarding frequency and outcome are scarce. patients with verySID progressed to lower RTID (P =.075), required intensive care unit transfer, and showed higher mortality. allogeneic HCT recipients were identified if they had symptoms or signs of RTID and the detection of RSV, PIV, or MPV by multiplex nucleic acid amplification testing. -host diseases (GvHD) grade 2 or bronchiolitis obliterans, leucopenia 1.0 109/liter or neutropenia 0.5 109/liter, lymphopenia 0.1 109/liter or hypogammaglobulinemia 4.5 g/L. moderate immunodeficiency (MID) was defined as HCT >6 months ago, GvHD grade 2, absolute leucocyte count >1.0 109/liter, absolute lymphocyte count intravenous immunoglobulin was administered at 0.5 g/kg bodyweight 1 to 3 times per week. treatment was discontinued if there was a clinical response, the respiratory viruses were no longer detectable. a 2-sided P value.05 was considered to be significant. duration of viral shedding was defined as the time from the first positive to the first negative virological result. multiple episodes in 1 patient were only considered for inclusion if they occurred at least 1 week apart and were caused by different viruses or by the same virus. systemic RBV was administered orally with a loading dose of 10 mg/kg bodyweight followed by 200 mg three-times daily (tid) intravenous immunoglobulin was administered at 0.5 g/kg bodyweight 1 to 3 times per week. the most common underlying disease was acute myeloid leukemia (20 of 66, 30%) at RTID diagnosis, 82% (54 of 66) of patients were in complete hematological remission and 58% (38 of 66) of patients suffered from GvHD (grade 2 in 27%, 18 of 66) myeloproliferative syndrome, n (%) 6 (5.8) 2 (4.2) 1 (3.0) 3 (13.6) Multiple myeloma, n (%) 13 (12.6) 6 (12.5) 4 (12.1) 3 (13.6) Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, n (%) 11 (10.7) 7 (14.6) 3 (9.1) 1 (4.5) Primary immunodeficiencies, n (%) 1 (1.0) 0 0 1 (4.5) Type myeloablative, n (%) 60 (58.3) 27 (56.3) 19 (57.6) 14 (63.6) Non-myeloablative, n (%) 43 (41.7) 21 (43.8) 14 (42.4) 8 (36.4) Hematological condition at RTID Diagnosis Complete remission 87 (84.5) 40 (83.3) 28 (84.8) 19 (86.4) patients with more than 1 episode of RTID had similar baseline characteristics compared with patients with only 1 episode. nineteen patients suffered from 2 or more different paramyxoviruses. median time of re-occurrence of patients infected with same virus was 415 days. V infections occur significantly more frequently during winter (P.001), whereas PIV infections appear significantly more often in autumn (P.001). in the SID group, 19 of 63 (30%) episodes had 2 SID criteria, thus fulfilling the criteria of verySID (Supplementary Table 2). oral RBV+IVIG was administered in 38 of 97 (39.2%) episodes. Respiratory syncytial virus and MPV episodes were more frequently treated with RBV+IVIG than PIV episodes (P.001). episodes among SID patients were more commonly treated than episodes with MID patients (47 of 63 vs 16 of 40; P =.001) episodes in SID patients were more commonly treated than episodes with MID patients (47 of 63 vs 16 of 40; P =.001) six of 103 episodes (6%) progressed from upper to lower RTID. one episode of PIV infection in an MID patient progressed to lower RTID without administration of any antiviral drug. 103 (38.8%) RTID episodes required hospitalization. lower RTID, absence of hematological complete remission, HCT 6 months, as well as presence of verySID criteria (P.001) were significantly associated with a higher risk of hospitalization in univariate analysis. hypogammaglobulinemia 4.5 g/L 2.46 (0.72\u20138.37).150 Graft-versus-host-disease 0.86 (0.38\u20131.95).722 Graft-versus-host-disease grade 2 0.61 (0.26\u20131.42).250 Bronchiolitis obliterans 0.62 (0.23\u20131.68).351 Immunosuppressive Treatment Calcineurin inhibitors 1.07 (0.48\u20132.37).866 Mycophenol six of 103 episodes were admitted to the intensive care unit and 2 required mechanical ventilation. the overall mortality was 6% (6 of 103 RTID episodes) the most common underlying disease was acute myeloid leukemia (20 of 66, 30%). at RTID diagnosis, 82% (54 of 66) of patients were in complete hematological remission and 58% (38 of 66) of patients suffered from GvHD (grade 2 in 27%, 18 of 66). 382 (162\u2013709) 503.5 (298.8\u20131066.8).859 Acute lymphoid leukemia, n (%) 17 (16.5) 8 (16.7) 5 (15.2) 4 (18.2) Acute myeloid leukemia, n (%) 31 (30.1) 15 (31.3) 9 (27.3) 7 (31.8) Chronic lymphoid leukemia, n (%) 7 (6.8) 2 (4.2) 2 (6.1) 3 (13.6) Chronic lymphoi n (%) 31 (30.1) 17 (35.4) 9 (27.3) 5 (22.7) D/R+/, n (%) 5 (4.9) 1 (2.1) 4 (12.1) 0 D/R+/+, n (%) 28 (27.2) 15 (31.3) 8 (24.2) 5 (22.7) Stem Cell Source 1.000 Bone marrow, n (%) 0 0 0 0 0 Peripheral blood, n (%) 102 (99.0 patients with more than 1 episode of RTID had similar baseline characteristics. nineteen patients suffered from 2 or more different paramyxoviruses. median time of re-occurrence of patients infected with same virus was 415 days. the frequency of the different paramyxovirus infections was similar during spring (Figure 1B) the frequency of the different paramyxoviruses was similar during spring (Figure 1B) -creatinine concentration (P =.942) or presence of anemia (P = 1.000) did not differ between the 3 viral infection groups. no fungal coinfections were seen in 24 episodes. only 1 dual paramyxovirus infection was detected with PIV and MPV. palivizumab was administered to only 1 patient with verySID suffering from RSV in the early posttransplant period. episodes among SID patients were more commonly treated than episodes with MID patients. six of 103 episodes (6%) progressed from upper to lower RTID. one episode of PIV infection in an MID patient progressed to lower RTID without administration of any antiviral drug. a reduction of FEV1 from baseline PFT to RTID diagnosis was documented for RTIDs caused by RSV and PIV. the DLCOc/VA was measured in 75 episodes (86.2%) and was only marginally influenced by the RTID. mission at RTI diagnosis 0.32 (0.10\u20130.95).041 0.62 (0.13\u20132.85).539 SID criteria One SIDb criteria 1.31 (0.57\u20132.97).525 VerySID 13.33 (3.56\u201349.96).001 12.08 (1.59\u201391.54).016 alloHCT 6 months 5.84 (1.88\u201318.13).002 2.35 (0.39\u201314.14).351 Leucocyte 1.0 109/liter; bSID criteria were defined as alloHCT 6 months ago. graft-versus-host-disease grade 2, leucopenia 1.0 109/liter or neutropenia 0.5 109/liter, lymphopenia 0.1 109/liter or hypogammaglobulinemia 4.5 g/liter, or T-cell or B-cell depletion 3 months ago. anic ventilation, n (%) 0 0 2 (10.5) Mortality, n (%) 0 0 6 (31.6) overall mortality was 6% (6 of 103 RTID episodes) all deaths occurred in patients with verySID. a recent study also showed that RTIDs continue to occur at high frequency in the late post-HCT phase after a median of 4 months. this is also reflected in the recently completed trial of the RSV fusion inhibitor presatovir. low or very low lymphocyte counts are an important determinant of progression and outcome. the impact of treatment with RBV and/or IVIG on outcome cannot be ascertained in our study. this is also reflected in a recent study for presatovir. treatment was more often provided in the setting of MPV infections than PIV infections. but the viral shedding was shorter for RBV-treated MPV infections, but this trend was not found for PIV. a score by Shah et al [43] is awaiting independent validation. study lacks a randomized control group to evaluate treatment approach. paramyxovirus RTID are frequent >100 days after allogeneic HCT and clinically more severe in SID patients despite preferential antiviral treatment. ofy077_suppl_supplemental_tables Click here for additional data file.
