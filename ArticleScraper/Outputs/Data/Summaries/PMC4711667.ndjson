{"summary": "EBOV initiates infection by fusion from within endosomes. cell-cell fusion has not been among the systems in use for EBOV. cell-cell fusion has several advantages over intracellular fusion assays. the GP1 subunit is cleaved by the endosomal proteases cathepsin B and/or L [7,23,24,25,26], while remaining attached to GP2 [9], and then binds to NPC1 [14,15]. the low pH within endosomes is necessary for viral fusion. but it has not been known whether low pH directly triggers fusion by causing conformational changes in GP or whether it augments fusion thermolysin treatment cleaves GP1 on the viral membrane into a fusion-competent form. the COS7 cells were bound to 293T target cells that were either unlabeled or loaded with the aqueous dye CMAC (blue) we tracked the transfer of calcein between cells to quantify the extents of fusion. effector cells expressing IAV HA were treated with trypsin and neuraminidase. fusion was triggered with a 10-min pH 5.0 pulse. for mock-transfected effector cells, a 10-min pH 5.7 pulse was employed. a 10-min pH 5.7 pulse applied at room temperature augmented fusion. for both thermolysin-treated and non-treated cells, a 10-min pH 5.7 pulse applied at room temperature augmented fusion. for each condition, at least 7 experiments were performed. the extent of fusion for non-treated effector cells 2 hrs after reneutralization was almost equal to that observed after a 1 hr reneutralization for thermolysin-treated cells. but 4 hrs after a pH 5.7 pulse, the extent of fusion was independent of whether EBOV GP was cleaved by thermolysin. effectsor cells that were not treated with thermolysin yielded fusion at pH 7.2. calcein spread was greater for target cells overexpressing NPC1. fusion was still pH-dependent for target cells overexpressing NPC1. overexpression of NPC1 led to greater fusion with effector cells than did mock-transfected target cells. for each set of experiments, a 10-min pH 5.7 pulse (labeled \u201cpulse pH +\u201d) led to more fusion than when pH was never lowered (-). for each condition, n = 4. a fraction of GP on the cell surface was cleaved into a fusion-competent form. an antibody that only recognizes cleaved GP has not been reported. we used a sNPC1 to examine cleaved GP by flow cytometry. antibody was detected by FITC-conjugated secondary antibody. the fraction of WT GP cleaved on parental cells was the same. cotransfection of cells by GPfurin and furin resulted in greater cleavage. vage of EBOV GP led to greater extent of fusion. cotransfecting cells with GP and furin led to more fusion. cotransfecting with GPfurin led to more fusion (bar 4) than transfecting only GPfurin (bar 1). blots showed cleavage of GP in cell lysate of transfected cells used in panels (A), (B), and (C) to confirm that the observed fusion was indeed mediated by EBOV GP. we used mutations that had previously been shown to greatly reduce viral infection. the inhibitor 3.47 and the neutralizing antibody KZ52 against EBOV GP significantly reduced EBOV GP-mediated cell-cell fusion. fusion was not further reduced by increasing the concentration of KZ52 beyond that employed in Fig 6B (S1A Fig) FITC-conjugated antibody showed presence of BafA1 reduced cleavage of plasma membrane GP. addition of BafA1 (25 or 100 nM) reduced the amount of cleaved GP that appeared on the cell surface. extents of fusion were always greater than those achieved after more acidic pulses. fusion was independent of pH for 5.7 and above after a 1 h reneutralization. effector cells expressing IAV HA showed the typical response of greater extents of fusion for lower pH values at all times after reneutralization. effector cells were labeled with DiO and target cells with DiI. both dyes were excited by a 488 nm laser. DiO emission was detected at 515 nm and DiI emission was recorded for 560 nm. effector cells with lipophilic fluorescent dye DiO labeled target cells with DiI. the double positive cells are clearly products of hemifusion or cell-cell fusion. the percentage of fusion for the representative experiment was 18.5% at pH 5.7, the optimal pH for fusion and only 1.5% at pH 5.0. calcein fluorescence equalizes for EBOV GP-induced pores. the fusion pores did not irreversibly close (or if they did, new pores opened) within tens of minutes of formation. calcein was loaded into effector cells and target cells were unlabeled. the right panels show calcein within the cells at t = 10 min. the red line is the trace for an EBOV GP pore. the blue line is the trace for a JSRV Env pore. the lower time scale in units of minutes refers to the EBOV GP pore. fusion pores typically did not enlarge sufficiently to allow passage of a molecule of the size of the nucleocapsid of EBOV. the slow time course for EBOV GP-mediated fusion necessitated that the tight electrical seal between the patch pipette and plasma membrane be maintained for long times. electrical measurements demonstrate the slow, limited growth of EBOV GP-mediated pores. traces of the three fusion pores, as detected by capacitance measurements, are shown. none appreciably enlarged. bar 2 was largely reversed by adding a recombinant cathepsin B to the external solution. the pool of EBOV GP on the cell surface that was previously uncleaved must have been cleaved by the added membrane-impermeant recombinant protease. chloroquine or NH4Cl was added 20 min prior to acidification. the majority of the blockage of EBOV GP-induced fusion by NH4Cl was restored by the addition of recombinant cathepsins B (rh CatB) to the external solution immediately after a 10-min pH 5.7 pulse. treatments expected to increase the amounts of cleaved EBOV GP on the cell surface led to greater extents of fusion. we prevented cathepsin-induced cleavage by treating bound effector and target cells with a cathepsin B inhibitor (CA-074) or a cathepsin L inhibitor (Z-FY-CHO) it is known that low pH acts, at least in part, by augmenting cathepsin activity on the cell surface. the same pattern of pH-dependence of fusion was observed for effector cells treated with thermolysin while cathepsin activity was continually inhibited. fusion was measured for the case without (third set of bars) and with a low pH pulse (fourth set) only inhibitors of cathepsin L or B diminished fusion. each of the four cathepsin inhibitors was added at the time of mixing effector and target cells. cathepsins aid EBOV GP-mediated fusion between cells. the reduction from the control was 2-fold; a 2-fold reduction also occurred when the cathepsin B inhibitor was constantly present. incubating effector cells that were not treated with thermolysin increased fusion significantly over the control (bar 1). GP-mediated fusion is independent of pH after cleavage of EBOV GP. fusion was much greater in the absence of a cathepsin inhibitor. fusion was independent of pH, and considerably less than when the trafficking inhibitor was not employed. fusion was caused by copies of EBOV GP that had been cleaved by thermolysin. acidity did not promote conformational changes in cleaved EBOV GP that would lead to fusion. EBOV GP mediates cell-cell fusion. effectsor COS7 cells transfected to express EBOV GP were loaded with calcein-AM (CaAM, green) and pretreated with thermolysin (Th) it has been shown that thermolysin treatment cleaves GP1 into a fusion-competent form. cells expressing EBOV GP were treated with 200 g/ml thermolysin for 20 min. fusion was triggered with a 10-min pH 5.0 pulse. effector cells expressing IAV HA were treated with trypsin and neuraminidase. a 10-min acidification led to greater amounts of fusion than occurred at neutral pH when measured after a 2-h reneutralization. Mock transfected effector cells did not support any dye transfer at neutral or low pH. thermolysin treatment results in greater extents of fusion between cells. the extent of fusion for non-treated effector cells (dark yellow circles) 2 hrs after reneutralization was almost equal to that observed after a 1 hr reneutralization for thermolysin-treated cells. but 4 hrs after a pH 5.7 pulse, the extent of fusion was independent of whether EBOV GP was cleaved. we used thermolysin-treated effector cells to maximize cleavage of EBOV GP. compared extents of fusion for target parental HEK 293T cells versus target HEK 293T cells that stably overexpressed NPC1. calcein spread was greater for target cells overexpressing NPC1. fusion increased by overexpressing the receptor for EBOV GP. overexpression of sNPC1 led to greater fusion with effector cells. for each set of experiments, a 10-min pH 5.7 pulse led to more fusion than when pH was never lowered. antibody against endogenous NPC1 was 3-fold greater than in absence of primary Ab. expression was reduced for cells in which NPC1 was knocked down by shRNA. copies of NPC1 reside in the plasma membrane of the 293 cells we used as targets in cell-cell fusion experiments. the extent of cleavage of GP on the plasma membrane would be greater for this construct than for WT. we determined the amount of cleaved GP on the cell surface by adding sNPC1 (fused with GST) to cells expressing either EBOV GP or GPfurin. the specificities of sNPC1 and antibody binding were confirmed by the 4\u20135 fold higher fluorescence than was seen for cells that did not express GP (bar 2). furin did not cleave any WT GP (lanes 1). cleavage of EBOV GP led to greater extent of fusion. cotransfecting with GPfurin led to more fusion (bar 4) than transfecting only GPfurin (bar 1). the same number of transfected cells were used to measure cleaved GP using sNPC1. the same number of transfected cells were used to measure cleaved GP using sNPC1. we used mutations that had previously been shown to greatly reduce viral infection. retroviral MLV pseudotyped infection is shown for a series of EBOV GP mutants. each mutant was expressed well on the cell surface as determined by flow cytometry using an anti-FLAG antibody. the small molecule inhibitor 3.47 and the neutralizing antibody KZ52 against EBOV GP blocked GP mediated fusion. a 10-min low pH pulse (pH 5.7 for EBOV GP, pH 5.4 for SFV E1-E2 cleaved by trypsin) was employed. a comparison was made between pH 5.7 and 7.2 in each column. fusion induced by EBOV GP is maximal at mildly acidic pH. extents of fusion were always greater than those achieved after more acidic pulses. fusion was independent of pH for 5.7 and above after a 1 h reneutralization. the extent of cell-cell fusion induced by IAV HA is shown for the same conditions as in panel (A) the extent of fusion as a function of pH (pH pulse applied at room temperature) after a 1 h and 4 h reneutralization. fusion was relatively independent of the acidity of the pH pulse. a low pH pulse did not greatly augment fusion. fusion could be a consequence of all cell pairs quickly fusing at low pH. we also monitored lipid dye continuity between effector cells and target cells. the fluorescence due to calcein never equalized between target and effector cells for EBOV GP-induced fusion. however, for fusion pores created by other viral fusion proteins, the fluorescence did equalize. the calcein fluorescence of a target cell never equalized the decreasing fluorescence of an effector cell. a small percentage of calcein is not free to transfer, possibly because it is bound to cellular elements. the small difference in fluorescence of effector and target cells connected by the JSRV Env pore indicates that a small percentage of calcein is not free to transfer. the size distribution of molecules labeled by CMTMR is expected to be quite diverse, some only somewhat larger than calcein and others very much larger. fusion pores typically did not enlarge sufficiently to allow passage of a molecule of the size of the nucleocapsid of EBOV. the absence of pore enlargement for EBOV GP suggests that many of the prior attempts at monitoring cell-cell fusion mediated by this fusion protein did not succeed. the finding that each of them did not exhibit increased conductance over time implies that the slow passage of fluorescent dyes through them was not due to structures that prevent their access to the pores. the elimination of fusion by the addition of 10 mM NH4Cl was most likely caused by reducing cathepsin activity. the pool of EBOV GP on the cell surface that was previously uncleaved must have been cleaved by the added membrane-impermeant recombinant protease. fusion induced by SFV E1/E2 (with a pH 5.4 pulse, second set of three bars) or IAV HA (cleaved into HA1-HA2 subunits by a standard trypsin procedure) neither chloroquine nor NH4Cl greatly reduced fusion. fusion was measured 1 h after reneutralization. EBOV GP was cleaved by cathepsins B and L, but not by cathepsins A or D. we also used Brefeldin A (BFA, 50 M) to further characterize the consequences for fusion of altering intracellular trafficking of EBOV GP. fusion observed in the absence of thermolysin treatment is due to copies of EBOV GP on the cell surface that have their GP1 subunits cleaved by cathepsins. results also document that neither cathepsin A or D cleaves EBOV into a fusion-competent form. fusion experiments were performed in the absence of a low-pH pulse (first set of columns) and with a pH 5.7 pulse (second set of columns) for effector cells not thermolysin-treated, fusion experiments were performed in the absence of a low-pH pulse. only inhibitors of cathepsin L or B diminished fusion, and they did so for all conditions. 293T cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding EBOV GP and cathepsin B. cleaved GP on the plasma membrane was measured by flow cytometry using sNPC1. GP-expressing cells were treated with thermolysin, and cleaved GP was normalized. we used sNPC1 to measure the percentage of GP in the plasma membrane that was cleaved. this percentage was greater than the control (column 1) in the presence of cathepsin B transfection. adding thermolysin to solution did indeed increase cleavage of cell surface GP. we incubated effector cells with BFA for 45 min to prevent further delivery of EBOV GP to the plasma membrane prior to a thermolysin-treatment. the extent of fusion was independent of pH, and considerably less than when the trafficking inhibitor was not employed. the finding that acidity did not promote the conformational changes in cleaved EBOV GP that would lead to fusion. lysin treatment significantly contributes to fusion. acidic conditions have no direct effect on EBOV GP-mediated fusion. the pH dependence of fusion is solely due to the ability of cathepsin to cleave EBOV GP. the EBOV GP fusion pore is large enough to allow the passage of calcein. fluorescent dye CMTMR does not permeate the pore because virtually all of it complexes with proteins; the complex becomes permeable only after a pore enlarges. a fraction of EBOV GP on the cell surface is cleaved. late endosomes and lysosomes are generally thought to be the cellular site of cleavage of EBOV GP by cathepsins. it is likely that a fraction of EBOV GP is cleaved within endosomes and then recycled to the plasma membrane where it mediates cell-cell fusion. thermolysin cleaves uncleaved copies of GP1 that are delivered to the cell surface. extents of cell-cell fusion induced by EBOV GP are affected by its delivery to, and loss from, plasma membranes. tetrandrine blocks these channels and inhibits EBOV infection by fusing to endosomal membranes that contain both NPC1 and the two-pore channel. fusion occurs after 4 h at neutral pH equal to the extent that follows a pH 5.7 pulse. acidification may promote more fusion at early times through activation of surface cathepsins that cleave EBOV GP. fusion mediated by the cleaved form is intrinsically pH-independent. cleaved EBOV GP is essentially a neutral pH fusion-inducing protein. fusion mediated by the cleaved form is intrinsically pH-independent. fusion kinetics for viral proteins that induce fusion are slower than for proteins that utilize low pH as a trigger. this could explain the slow fusion kinetics of EBOV GP-mediated cell-cell fusion. a need to continually deliver EBOV GP could be the reason. thermolysin converts all surface GP to the cleaved form, resulting in the maximum extent of fusion. EBOV GP can undergo endocytosis from the plasma membrane and eventually reach late endosomes and lysosomes. it is then cleaved by cellular cathepsins, bound by NPC1, and recycled back to plasma membrane. the mucin-deleted EBOV GP construct was originally obtained from David Sanders (Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN) the plasmid to express JSRV Env has been described [38]. cell lines HEK 293T and COS7 cells employed have been previously described. all cells were grown in modified Eagle\u2019s medium with glucose, L-glutamine, and sodium pyruvate. all cells were grown in aqueous dye transfer. 2x106 cells/ml were incubated with 10 M DiO for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. the day before an experiment, target cells were split and plated on glass cover slips placed in culture dishes so as to allow convenient transfer. labeled effector cells were thermolysin treated (200 g/ml) and added above labeled target cells. fusion protein was induced in E. Coli. by IPTG (0.5 mM) and purified by glutathione sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) HEK293T cells were transfected with EBOV GP or GPfurin. cells were detached by PBS containing 5 mM EDTA. one portion (1 million cells) was used to measure cleaved GP by incubating cells with 2 g sNPC1 for 2 h on ice. EBOV GP was proteinase K-sensitive by treating cells with 0.2 mg/ml proteinase K for 20 min, and maintaining or removing it as indicated. all experiments were performed in parallel on the same days; as controls, proteinase K was not employed. the same procedure was used with chloroquine (100 M unless stated otherwise) or BafA1 (25 or 100 nM) to cause endosome neutralization. the ionic and buffering contents of the low pH solutions were pre-adjusted to the required pH so as to maintain osmotic strength at 290 mOsM during low pH pulses. fusion was promoted by a 10-min pH 5.7 pulse at room temperature. a seal between the patch pipette and cell could only be maintained once solutions and temperature were established. temperature was raised to 37\u00b0C for 15 min before attempting electrical measurements. a single asterisk (*) denotes p 0.05, two asterisks (**) denotes p 0.01, and three asterisks (***) denotes p 0.001. the mucin-deleted EBOV GP construct was originally obtained from David Sanders (Purdue University, west Lafayette, IN) all GP mutants, including GPfurin, were made by overlapping PCR. a standard calcium phosphate method was used to express SFV E1/E2 via transfection of the pCB3-wt vector. a small molecular inhibitor, 3.47, was a gift of James Cunningham. 2x106 cells were loaded with 20 M CMAC. hek 293T cells were maintained in the same media and in the same way as COS7 cells. hek 293T cells were used as targets. target cells were labeled by 100 M DiO for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. labeled effector cells were incubated with trypsin for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. the day before an experiment, target cells were split and plated on glass cover slips. fusion protein was induced in E. Coli. by IPTG (0.5 mM) and purified by glutathione sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) protein was quantified by a Bradford assay and used for cell-cell fusion and for measurements of cleaved GP. mutants were transfected with plasmids encoding the EBOV GP or mutants. the viruses were used to infect HTX cells, a subclone of HT10180. fusion was determined by counting AP+ foci 72 h after infection. the time of transfer is defined as time = 0. for thermolysin-treated cells. the extents of fusion were quantified at varied times by spread of calcein. the fluorescence of both effector and target cells was proportional to calcein concentration. a secondary FITC-conjugated goat anti-human antibody was added at a final concentration of 100 g/ml and maintained for 45 min at room temperature in the dark. cells were then fixed for 20 min with 2% paraformaldehyde, and washed twice with DMEM. patch clamp Pore size over time was also quantified by using patch clamp time-resolved admittance measurements. t-tests were used to compare the outcome of a manipulation on fusion as compared to the control. a single asterisk (*) denotes p 0.05, two asterisks (**) denotes p 0.01, and three asterisks (***) denotes p 0.001. left-hand bars of each pair denote that a pH pulse was not applied. adding proteinase K and washing out immediately before thermolysin treatment virtually abolished fusion. Waiting 3 h completely restored fusion (third set of bars) expression of EBOV GP was greatly reduced by the proteinase K treatment. significantly recovered after protease was absent for 3 h. presence of Brefeldin A (BFA, 50 M) at all points of the fusion protocol reduced fusion greatly (bar 2) compared to control."}
