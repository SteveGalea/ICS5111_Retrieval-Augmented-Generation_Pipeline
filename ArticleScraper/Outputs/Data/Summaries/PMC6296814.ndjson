Statistical analysis The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used for identification of qualitative factors that support systematic evaluation or evaluation criteria that were complex. it was useful as quantitative results were obtained by systematically scaling the ratio of the relative importance or preferences. the priorities of these 32 policy projects were evaluated on this basis. weighted values were then given to 32 policy projects after pairwise comparison. aHP analysis was performed with expert Choice software. results involving \u2018Establishment of a response to suicidal risk and post-management system\u2019 (6.76), \u2018Establishment of evidence-based research systems for suicide prevention\u2019 (6.15), \u2018Reinforcement of crisis psychological support such as that for disaster victims\u2019 (6.07), and \u2018Improvement of suicidal risk circumstances\u2019 (5.74) were evaluated. 4.8 5.07 5.02 4.96 Intensive management support to high risk groups of stress 4.46 4.81 4.37 4.55 Reinforcement of crisis psychological support such as that for disaster victims 5.09 6.07 5.25 5.47 Construction of mental health support systems across generations Mental health support to infants 3.95 4.85 4.38 4.39 Mental health support to children and adolescents 4.62 5.34 4.59 4.85 Mental health support to young and middle-aged people 3.58 3.67 3.54 3.60 Mental health support to the elderly 4.24 5.06 intervention service provision for high risk groups of addiction 3.9 4.43 4.23 4.19 Reinforcement of treatment and restoration support for addicts 4.88 4.42 4.2 4.17 Realization of a safe society without suicidal risk Construction of total social environment for suicide prevention Improvement of social recognition 4.6 4.88 4.74 4.74 4.74 Establishment of social support systems for suicide prevention 5.32 6.15 5.69 5.72 Improvement of suicidal risk circumstances 4.9 5.74 5.09 5.24 Provision of customized suicide prevention services Promotion of counter 63 Magnitude of the ripple effect Projects for national mental health promotion 0.299 4.39 1.31 Projects for rehabilitation support to patients with mental illness 0.172 4.46 0.77 Projects for technology development of total periodic addiction management 0.170 4.26 0.72 Projects for reinforcement of social safety networks for suicide prevention 0.359 5.45 1.95 Total 1.000 - 4.76 Necessity of a national response Projects for national mental health promotion 0.195 4.95 0.96 projects. 7 people in their 30s, 17 people in their 40s, and 3 people in their 50s. their majors were psychiatry, nursing science, preventive medicine, health science, social welfare, clinical psychology, medical biotechnology, medical informatics, and humanities and social sciences. 5 people were employed for less than 10 years, 16 people were employed for 10 years or more, 5 people were employed for 20 years or more, and 1 person was employed for 30 years or more. results involving \u2018Establishment of a response to suicidal risk and post-management systems\u2019 (6.59), \u2018Establishment of evidence-based research systems for suicide prevention\u2019 (6.41), \u2018Establishment of a social support systems for suicide prevention\u2019 (5.69), \u2018Improvement of health insurance and medical benefit cost system\u2019 (5.34), \u2018Reinforcement of crisis psychological support such as that for disaster victims\u2019 (5.25), were ranked in the order named. health support systems across generations Mental health support to infants 3.95 4.85 4.38 4.39 Mental health support to children and adolescents 4.62 5.34 4.59 4.85 Mental health support to young and middle-aged people 3.58 3.67 3.54 3.60 Mental health support to the elderly 4.24 5.06 4.3 4.53 Integration of patients with serious mental illness into local communities Prevention of early intensive treatment Improvement of health insurance and medical benefit cost system 5.45 5.7 5.34 5.50 Development of incipient mental illness patient management models and treatments 5.09 the results such as necessity of a national response (5.23), magnitude of the ripple effect (4.76) and possibility of technology development success (4.63) are ranked in the sequence listed. national response Projects for mental health promotion 0.195 4.95 0.96 Projects for rehabilitation support to patients with mental illness 0.237 4.93 1.17 Projects for technology development of total periodic addiction management 0.186 4.64 0.86 Projects for reinforcement of social safety networks for suicide prevention 0.382 5.86 2.24 Total 1.000 - 5.23 4. Priorities of 32 policy projects Figure 1 illustrates the results of drawing priorities of 32 policy projects. a response to public demand related to a disaster and psychological crisis support, would generate greater support for R&D projects. a response to public demand related to a disaster and psychological crisis support, would generate greater support for R&D policies. 'promotion of national mental health' should consider promotion of mental health in local communities, management of mental health through lifestyle choices for prevention/diagnosis, development of treatments, and mental health management in high risk groups. the aim is for emotional anxiety of people involved in disasters such as the sewol ferry accident and earthquakes. the policy objective of 'Realization of a safe society without suicidal risk' considers establishment of suicide prevention countermeasures and construction of systems managing a suicide high risk group as crucial factors. projects involved with obtaining data may enable continuous monitoring systems for persons vulnerable to committing suicide. only a small number of questionnaires were analyzed from the online survey carried out by the experts. this led to partial and untrustworthy responses being excluded."}
