{"summary": "FETPs are a competent and diverse source of highly skilled public health professionals who contribute significantly to public health\u2019s global human resource needs. results A total of 6980 public health professionals worldwide have graduated from an FETP or from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Epidemiology Intelligence Service. 57 FETPs belong to one global network, the Training Program in Epidemiology and Public Health Interventions Network (TEPHINET) all 57 FETPs belong to one global network, the training program in epidemiology and public health interventions network (TEPHINET) the number of countries that send health professionals for training to FETPs has also grown from 10 to 84. FETPs are typically hosted by a country\u2019s MOH or national public health institute and are closely affiliated with local public health institutions and universities. the institutions that host FETPs are vitally important to their development and sustainability because they provide space, equipment, staff, expertise and a potential career path for residents. the FETP focus on learning through service Most FETPs are modelled on the Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS), established in 1951 at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) FETPs also require residents to support the host institution priorities through field assignments during which the residents apply the concepts learned during didactic teaching. regional networks of FETPs have formed to increase the capacity of the global network to share information and implement quality improvement measures. the regional networks comprise several countries in the same geographic area. some regional FETPs have headquarters in one country and train residents of neighbouring countries. FETPs are requested to update this information every 2 to 3 years. data on FETP course offerings, training competencies, criteria for residents to apply to the programme, proportion of field versus didactic training, and collaborating agencies and organizations were abstracted from the membership surveys. key activities and accomplishments of programmes in 2012 were added to the repository of programme information. at least 60% of training is in-service and supports national public health priorities. 58.5% of FETPs now grant a master of public health or a master of epidemiology. many FETPs now offer specializations in laboratory science or veterinary epidemiology. 41 of 57 FETPs report being hosted by one public health institution. of these, 21 were hosted by an MOH, 15 by a public health institute and 5 by a local university. the remaining 16 FETPs are hosted by two institutions. the number of residents currently enrolled in an FETP somewhere in the world is 1269. most graduates are physicians (51%), with the rest being epidemiologists (22%), veterinarians (9%), laboratory specialists (9%), pharmacists (3%) or some other type of health professional (6%). the number of residents currently enrolled in an FETP somewhere in the world is 1269. about 50% of graduates reported working in their country\u2019s MOH. close to 70% reported working in a governmental organization for 5 years or more. FETPs can strengthen a country\u2019s public health capacity. from 52 countries to the most recent TEPHINET global scientific conference in amman, Jordan in November 2012. out of the 759 abstracts submitted 231 were selected for oral or poster presentation. presentation topics included HIV, influenza (H1N1), malaria, cholera, tuberculosis, measles, nutrition, road traffic injuries, brucellosis and vaccine-preventable diseases. FETP training programmes value learning by doing or learning through service. at least 60% of training is in-service and supports national public health priorities. 58.5% of FETPs now grant a master\u2019s degree or a master\u2019s degree. FETPs offer training in each of 13 subjects. bioethics, health economics, scientific writing, software for data analysis, research methods, programme evaluation, health promotion, qualitative research. the global network of FETPs (excluding the US EIS programme) collectively graduated 3678 epidemiologists, which is approximately 73% of all those who enrol. the number of residents currently enrolled in an FETP somewhere in the world is 1269. FETP is the model for most FETPs and FE(L)TPs. includes Kazakhstan, Kyrgystan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and uzbekistan. FETP collaborated with the WHO and CDC to identify 53 high-risk areas for the project - stop the transmission of Polio. residents and graduates of the programmes submitted 759 abstracts from 52 countries to the most recent TEPHINET global scientific conference in amman, Jordan in November 2012. this was the largest submission of abstracts to a TEPHINET scientific conference. all FETPs have a regional or programme representative involved in finalizing the process for programmes to apply for accreditation. an accreditation manual summarizing the criteria and process to become accredited was created in may 2012. this manual will be updated with information obtained from pilot site-visits to a programme in each region, so that interested programmes can apply to the process in 2014. FETPs and their thousands of graduates are not only evidence of a resource to serve communities effectively, but also of a significant human health resource for addressing emerging and established public health challenges. the global network of FETPs has continued to grow and adapt to meet the changing needs of public health and to improve field epidemiology training to produce skilled health professionals. he helped develop the final concept of the article and the draft submitted to reviewers. all authors approved the final manuscript."}
