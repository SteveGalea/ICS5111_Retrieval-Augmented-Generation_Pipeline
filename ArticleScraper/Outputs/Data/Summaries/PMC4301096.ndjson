{"summary": "the evolution of hepatitis E is often benign, but severe forms or chronic infections have been described. sporadic cases have been reported in patients who have never traveled to areas where HEV is endemic. sporadic cases have been reported in pregnant women (20%) (1, 2). the cellular factors involved in the replication and/or virulence of HEV are still unknown. in the recently proposed classification of HEVs, HEVs that can infect humans belong to the Orthohepevirus genus, Orthohepevirus A species. approach has been used to study infections caused by several viruses. a recent proteomic analysis of livers infected by swine hepatitis E virus identified 10 proteins that may be involved in HEV infection. the three strains studied belonged to three different phylogenetic clusters. strains A, B, and C clustered within subtypes 3c, 3e, and 3f. fecal suspensions were prepared (2 g in 10% [wt/vol] phosphate buffer) liver, bile, and feces were collected, and livers were frozen in liquid nitrogen for proteomic analysis. this experimental protocol was validated by the ethics committee (comEth number 12-043) of the national veterinary school of alfort, the french Agency for food, environmental and  occupational health & safety, and University Paris 12. e 30 mg of liver was incubated on ice with a lysis buffer (7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% CHAPS 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate, 2% immobilized pH gradient (PIP) buffer, 40 mM dithiothreitol, and 1% protease inhibitor mix [Roche]) electrophoresis was performed using an IPGphor apparatus (GE Healthcare) for a total of 60 kV h. gels were scanned using a Typhoon 9400 molecular imager (GE Healthcare) the mass spectrometer acquired data throughout the elution process. full MS scans were acquired with the Orbitrap mass spectrometer. for full MS, automatic gain control (AGC) was 1 106, the resolution was 6 104. oxidation as a variable modification for methionines was tolerated. cDNA synthesis was performed from 400 ng of total liver RNA at 42\u00b0C for 60 min. the reverse transcriptase activity of PrimeScript reverse transcriptase TaKaRa was then heat inactivated at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. PCR was performed using a green PCR kit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France) a lightCycler PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Meylan, France) was used for sample analysis according to following steps: 30 s at 94\u00b0C and 45 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 30 s, annealing for 30 s at 56\u00b0C, and an extension at 72\u00b0C for 30 s. each sample was analyzed in duplicate. incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:3,000) or rabbit anti-goat Ig (1:5,000) or goat anti-rabbit Ig (1:5,000) for 1 h at room temperature (Dako, Les Ulis, France) Blots were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence and scanned with a Fusion Fx5 solo system. piglets negative for anti-HEV antibodies and HEV RNA were divided into four groups. the first group was mock infected and inoculated intravenously with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) the other groups were inoculated intravenously with a suspension of HEV strain A, B, or C containing 106 copies of HEV RNA. pig liver samples were collected and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. tissues were then dehydrated and embedded in paraffin. 2D-DIGE analysis. each protein sample (50 g) was labeled with CyDyes Fluor minimal dyes (GE Healthcare) according to manufacturer's instructions. a spot was considered differentially expressed if the fold change was larger than +1.5 or smaller than 1.5. PCA was performed on the global distribution of proteins. peptides were loaded and washed on a C18 reverse-phase precolumn. the loading buffer contained 98% H2O, 2% acetonitrile (ACN) and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. the maximum ion injection time was 500 ms; for MS/MS, AGC was 5 103. the minimum signal threshold was 500, the isolation width was 2 Da. the dynamic exclusion time setting was 15 s. cDNA synthesis was performed from 400 ng of total liver RNA at 42\u00b0C for 60 min with 2.5 l of hexamer, 60 U of PrimeScript reverse transcriptase TaKaRa. reverse transcriptase activity of PrimeScript reverse transcriptase TaKaRa was heat inactivated at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. real-time PCR was performed using a SYBR green PCR kit. a lightCycler PCR system was used for sample analysis. the data were submitted to quantitative analysis using the 2CT threshold cycle (CT) method. the proteins of interest were detected using goat polyclonal anti-GAPDH (1/100; clone V18; catalog number sc-20357; Clinisciences, Nanterre, France) the membranes were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:3,000) or rabbit anti-goat Ig (1:5,000) or goat anti-rabbit Ig (1:5,000) for 1 h at room pigs were euthanized at 8 days p.i., and the bile and liver were collected from each animal. the pigs were euthanized at 8 days p.i., and the bile and liver were collected from each animal. median viral RNA level reached 5.4 106 GE g1 with strain A. median levels were 7.6 106 GE ml1, 1.86 106 GE ml1 and 1.81 106 GE ml1 respectively. most specimens were affected by diffuse liver steatosis. the level of cholesterol did not significantly differ between mock-infected pigs and pigs in the infected groups (strain A, 0.82 mmol/liter; strain B, 0.83 mmol/liter; strain C, 0.84 mmol/liter) the median triglyceride levels obtained for pigs infected with strain C were significantly lower (0.32 mmol/liter) the data represent the medians and minimum and maximum values obtained for three pigs in each group. a total of four groups were analyzed: a mock-infected group (group T) and the groups infected with the three different strains: strain A, strain B, and strain C. 153 differential spots were excised and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization\u2013time of flight/time of flight. a total of 24, 25, and 30 different proteins were identified with the strain A-, strain B-, and strain C-infected groups. no upregulation of a protein involved in transcription/transcription regulation was identified with strain A. downregulated proteins identified with strain C were distributed into the eight functional groups. metabolism (43%), cholesterol/lipid metabolism (13%), cytoskeleton/trafficking (13%), signaling pathways (9%), cell proliferation (9%), chaperone proteins (4%), transcription/transcription regulation (4%), and toxicity/inflammatory/immune response (4%). 02 1.3 Glutamine synthetase GLNA_PIG 1.9E02 2.0 2.1E03 1.7 1.2E02 2.2 Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K gi|392513715 2.2E01 1.6 1.2E02 1.8 7.1E03 1.6 Indolethylamine N-methyltransferase gi|347800713 3.0E02 1.7 1.1E02 1.5 1.2E 1.4E02 1.5 3.5E01 1.3 3.0E01 1.4 4-Trimethylaminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase gi|194036835 1.7E01 1.2 5.2E02 1.3 7.3E05 2.4 Actin, cytoplasmic 1 ACTB_PIG 1.1E01 1.1 1.8E01 1.1 5.5E03 1.5 Aminoacylase-1 ACY1_PIG 1.6E02 1.7 lysosomal thiol reductase GILT_PIG 1.0E02 1.6 1.9E02 1.4 2.8E01 1.2 Golgi reassembly-stacking protein 2 isoform 1 gi|335302969 1.5E01 1.4 9.1E02 1.4 2.2E02 1.6 Golgi reassembly-stacking protein 2 isoform 1 gi|3353029 02 1.6 Liver carboxylesterase EST1_PIG 4.8E02 2.3 1.1E01 2.1 6.8E02 1.8 l-Lactate dehydrogenase B chain LDHB_PIG 2.6E02 1.7 1.1E02 1.4 5.1E02 1.4 Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase FKBP4 gi|305855148 2.0E02 1.6 4.3E01 1.2 7E02 1.3 3.3E01 1.4 2.7E03 2.8 Pyruvate kinase isozymes R/L-like gi|350597093 2.7E01 1.7 3.6E02 1.5 6.2E02 1.4 Retinol-binding protein 4 RET4_PIG 1.0E01 1.4 4.4E02 1.3 2.3E02 1.7 Ribokinase/actin, cytoplasmic 1 gi 1.3 1.9E01 1.4 4.6E02 1.5 Tetranectin-like isoform 2 gi|335298955 1.5E01 1.3 1.9E01 1.4 4.3E03 1.6 Threonine synthase-like 1-like gi|335296548 2.8E01 1.5 1.2E01 1.3 4.2E02 1.7 trans-1,2-Dihydrobenzene-1,2-diol dehydrogenase DH positive fold change values represent upregulation, whereas negative fold change values indicate downregulation of identified proteins. expression levels of three proteins upregulated with all three HEV strains were quantified after immunoblotting. the results were comparable to the fold changes observed by 2D-DIGE analysis, which were, with strains A, B, and C, 1.6, 1.8, and 1.6, respectively, for HnRNPK. the results were comparable to the fold changes observed by 2D-DIGE analysis, which were, with strains A, B, and C, 1.6, 1.8, and 1.6, respectively, for HnRNPK. changes of HnRNPK and PP2A were comparable for strains A, B, and C. however, the mRNA level of PHB was higher with strain C than with the other two strains (strain A, 1.8; strain B, 1.8; strain C, 2.5) infection with strains B and C resulted in a stronger upregulation of the mRNA of ApoE than infection with strain A. a network was built using the Ingenuity Pathway system. the results showed that 17 proteins, approximately the same number obtained with Pathway Studio software, could be connected in a network. candidates whose expression is modulated during HEV strain C infection were imported into the Ingenuity Pathway program. pigs were euthanized at 8 days p.i., and the bile and liver were collected from each animal. there was no significant difference in the kinetics of HEV fecal excretion in fecal samples. no significant difference in viral RNA level of strains A, B, and C was observed in bile samples. median levels were 7.6 106 GE ml1, 1.86 106 GE ml1, and 1.81 106 GE ml1 respectively. most specimens were affected by diffuse liver steatosis. the level of cholesterol did not significantly differ between mock-infected pigs and pigs in the infected groups. median triglyceride levels obtained for pigs infected with strain C were significantly lower (0.32 mmol/liter) than those obtained for pigs infected with strain A (0.44 mmol/liter) 2D-DIGE analysis of infected and uninfected livers was performed. a total of four groups were analyzed: a mock-infected group (group T) and the groups infected with the three different strains: strain A, strain B, and strain C. 153 differential spots were excised and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization\u2013time of flight/time of flight (MALDI-TOF/TOF) tandem mass spectrometry (MS) and LTQ-Orbitrap MS. a total of 24, 25, and 30 different proteins were identified with the strain A-, strain B-, and strain C-infected groups. downregulated proteins identified with strain C were involved in metabolism (22%), cholesterol/lipid metabolism (22%), chaperone proteins (22%), signaling pathways (11%), cytoskeleton/trafficking (11%), or toxicity/inflammatory/immune response (11%). cleoprotein K gi|392513715 2.2E01 1.6 1.2E02 1.8 7.1E03 1.6 Indolethylamine N-methyltransferase gi|347800713 3.0E02 1.7 1.1E02 1.5 1.2E01 1.3 Phosphoglucomutase-2 and mitochondrial inner membrane protein, partial 3.7E02 1.6 1.3E02 1.8 8.3E03 2.0 Serotransferrin TR 1.2 5.2E02 1.3 7.3E05 2.4 Actin, cytoplasmic 1 ACTB_PIG 1.1E01 1.1 1.8E01 1.1 5.5E03 1.5 Aminoacylase-1 ACY1_PIG 1.6E02 1.7 1.8E02 1.5 9.2E03 1.4 Apolipoprotein A-IV APOA4_PIG 3.4E02 1.7 2.7E01 1.5 1.5E03 2.5 Apolipoprotein E APOE reassembly-stacking protein 2 isoform 1 gi|335302969 1.5E01 1.4 9.1E02 1.4 2.2E02 1.6 Golgi reassembly-stacking protein 2 isoform 1 gi|335302969 9.2E02 1.3 2.1E02 1.7 2.6E02 1.5 Heat shock protein beta-1 HSPB1_PIG 2.7E01 1.2 1.9E02 1.4 LDHB_PIG 2.6E02 1.7 1.1E02 1.4 5.1E02 1.4 Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase 2.0E02 1.6 4.3E01 1.2 3.8E01 1.1 Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP), mitochondrial gi|330417958 3.5E02 2.0 1.1E01 1.8 3.0E01 1.4 Phosphoenolpyr 1.7 3.6E02 1.5 6.2E02 1.4 Retinol-binding protein 4 RET4_PIG 1.0E01 1.4 4.4E02 1.3 2.3E02 1.7 Ribokinase/actin, cytoplasmic 1 gi|351738777/ACTB_PIG 4.0E02 1.5 3.5E01 1.1 4.9E02 1.4 Serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2A 65-kD 1.3 3.5E01 1.2 5.0E03 1.6 Type VI collagen alpha-1 chain gi|335310813 4.4E02 2.1 4.1E01 1.3 5.0E01 1.3 Ubiquitin/ISG15-conjugating enzyme E2 L6 gi|350539097 2.8E02 1.6 9.4E01 1.0 6.2E01 1.1 Valacyclovir hydrolase precursor or alcohol dehydrogenase 1C (class I the number represents the percentage of identified proteins categorized in the indicated functional classification for each strain of HEV tested when their expression was compared to that in the control group (group T). the expression levels of three proteins upregulated with all three HEV strains were quantified after immunoblotting. results were comparable to the fold changes observed by 2D-DIGE analysis. strains A, B, and C were 1.6, 1.8, and 1.6, respectively, for HnRNPK;

HEV particles are secreted into the intestinal lumen via the bile duct. it is possible that the secretion of new HEV progeny virions involves some hepatocyte transporter proteins involved in the secretion of biliary lipids. lipids are secreted into the intestinal lumen via the bile duct. the tricarboxylic acid cycle (succinate dehydrogenase, short-chain specific acyl coenzyme A [acyl-CoA] dehydrogenase) and amino acid metabolism (3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase, threonine synthase, etc.) were identified. some transcription factors, such as STAT3, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4), sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1 (SREBF-1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR) are probably impacted by HEV infection. this protein has been shown to enhance the infection with several viruses by interacting either with a viral genome, such as the genome of HCV (59\u201361), HBV (62), enterovirus 71 (63), or influenza A virus (64) this protein has been shown to enhance the infection with several viruses by interacting either with a viral genome, such as with the genome of HCV. a similar proteomic analysis of HEV-infected liver was performed by Lee and collaborators using another strain of HEV. 10 factors were found to be modulated during infection, and only the upregulation of ApoE was confirmed. some of these proteins have previously been shown to interact with HEV ORF3 or ORF2. the data provided important guidance for further analysis of the pathogenesis of HEV."}
