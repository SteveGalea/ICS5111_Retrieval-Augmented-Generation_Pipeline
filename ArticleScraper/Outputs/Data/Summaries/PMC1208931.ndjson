{"summary": "in the past globalisation has often been seen as a more or less economic process. but health inequalities between rich and poor persist, while the prospects for future health depend increasingly on the relative new processes of globalisation. our identification of the most important factors influencing health is based on a comprehensive analysis of a diverse selection of existing health models. we argue that the nature of the determinants and their level of causality can be combined into a basic framework that conceptualises the complex multi-causality of population health. globalisation is a co-evolution of multiple technological, cultural, economic, political, social and environmental trends at all conceivable spatiotemporal scales. globalisation is an intensification of cross-national cultural, economic, political, social and environmental interactions that lead to the global integration of cultural, economic, environmental, political and social processes on global, supranational, national, regional and local levels. globalisation is characterised by global changes in economic infrastructures and the emergence of global markets and a global trading system. global mobility is characterised by a major increase in the extensity, intensity and velocity of movement. cross-cultural interaction Globalisation makes the sharing of information and the exchange of experiences around common problems possible. globalisation and distal health determinants Figure 3 shows that the processes of globalisation can have an impact on all identified distal determinants. the most important organisations in global health governance are the world health organisation (WHO) and the world bank (WB). 'optimists' argue that global markets facilitate economic growth and economic security, which would benefit health. 'optimists' argue that global markets facilitate economic growth and economic security, which would benefit health. 'pessimists' are worried about the health effects of the exclusion of nations and persons from the global market. they argue that the risk of exclusion from the growth dynamics of economic globalisation is significant in the developing world. notwithstanding some spectacular growth rates in the 1980's, especially in east Asia, incomes per capita declined in almost 70 countries during the same period. globalisation can decrease the risk on tensions and conflicts, as societies become more dependent on each other due to the worldwide increase in global communication, global mobility and cross-cultural interactions. others argue that the resistance to globalisation has resulted in religious fundamentalism and to worldwide tensions and intolerance. the term 'globalisation of education' suggests getting education into every nook and cranny of the globe. millions of people acquire part of their knowledge from transworld textbooks. the term 'globalisation of education' suggests getting education into every nook and cranny of the globe. the most important organisations in global health governance are the world health organization (WHO) and the world bank (WB) the most important organisations in global health governance are the world health organization (WHO) and the world bank (WB) 'optimists' argue that global markets facilitate economic growth and economic security, which would benefit health. 'pessimists' are worried about the health effects of the exclusion of nations and persons from the global market. human migration has increased at unprecedented rates, according to et al. tourism is one of the most obvious forms of cultural globalisation. tourism is one of the most obvious forms of cultural globalisation and it illustrates the increasing time-space compression of current societies. it is feared that self-interested individualism of the marketplace spills over into cultural norms and values. exclusion involves disintegration from common cultural processes, lack of participation in social activities, alienation from decision-making and civic participation. a socially integrated individual has many social connections, in the form of both intimate social contacts and more distal connections. tv, film and computer graphics have greatly enlarged the visual dimensions of communication. tv, film and computer graphics have greatly enlarged the visual dimensions of communication. it is expected that the above-discussed developments will also improve health training and health education. health is increasingly perceived as a private good leaving the law of the market to determine whose health is profitable for investment and whose health is not. populations of transitional economies are no longer protected by a centralized health sector that provides universal access to everyone and some groups are even denied the most basic medical services. social interactions through the internet influenced the coping ability of HIV-positive individuals through promoting empowerment, augmenting social support and facilitating helping others. violence often is the result of the complex interplay of many factors. the WHO argues that globalisation gives rise to obstacles as well as benefits for violence prevention. smoking tobacco is predicted to be the leading health risk factor by 2030. it causes cancer of the trachea, bronchus and lung [49] and cardiovascular diseases. alcohol consumption increases to risk on liver cirrhosis, raised blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, pancreatitis and cancers of the oropharnix. the spread of infectious diseases is probably one of the most mentioned health effects of globalisation and past disease outbreaks have been linked to factors that are related to the globalisation process. the combination of movement of goods (Figure 3; arrow 10) and people (Figure 3; arrow 11), and profound changes affecting ecosystem goods and services (Figure 3; arrow 12) all contribute to increased risk of disease spread. free trade permits food consumption to grow faster than domestic food production in countries where there are constraints on increasing the latter. some argue that the forces of globalisation in fact endanger food security. globalisation is accompanied by privatisation policies affecting the provision of water [65]. governments and international financial institutions promote privatisation. but others are less optimistic about the effects of privatisation. health services are increasingly influenced by globalisation-induced changes in health care policy (Figure 3; arrow 5), economic development and trade (Figure 3: arrow 6), but also by migration (3: arrow 7). health is increasingly perceived as a private good leaving the law of the market to determine whose health is profitable for investment and whose health is not. globalisation-induced changes in social cohesion, integration and interaction can influence the degree of social support in a population. this link is demonstrated by Reeves [47] who discussed that social interactions through the Internet influenced the coping ability of HIV-positive individuals through promoting empowerment, augmenting social support and facilitating helping others. violence is often the result of the complex interplay of many factors. inactivity linked to obesity, coronary hearth disease, hypertension, strokes, diabetes, colon cancer, breast cancer and osteoporotic fractures. smoking tobacco is predicted to be the leading health risk factor by 2030. health education can play a role in promoting healthy lifestyles. policies can also directly discourage unhealthy behaviour by means of economic incentives (e.g. charging excise on tobacco) food food trade has become an increasingly important factor with regard to food security worldwide. at present, however, the developed countries usually subsidise their agricultural sectors. current liberalisation policies are expected to have profound implications on food trade and, subsequently food security [60], some argue that the resulting free trade will create access to better and cheaper food supplies via food imports. globalisation process can increase food security by facilitating the worldwide implementation of better technologies and improved knowledge (e.g. irrigation technologies, research on genetically modified food) conflicts are, of course, a threat to food security and it is expected that food security in sub-Saharan Africa, for example, will not increase without the establishment of political instability. water The effects of globalisation are also raising concerns over water security. globalisation is causing profound and complex changes in the nature of our society. effects of globalisation are causing a growing concern for our health. the intergenerational equity implied by sustainable development forces us to think about the right of future generations to a healthy environment and a healthy life. approach has several beneficial characteristics. first, it is embedded in a holistic approach towards globalisation. the conceptual framework is embedded in a holistic approach towards population health."}
