{"summary": "plasma proteomic fingerprinting can provide a molecular snapshot defining disease state that can be used to develop point-of-care diagnostics. 156 patients with active TB and 110 symptomatic controls were investigated. the global burden of active TB occurs on a background of quiescent or latent TB infection (LTBI), affecting one third of the world\u2019s population and a higher proportion of the population of TB-endemic areas. in terms of rapid diagnosis, sputum microscopy will only identify approximately 50% of patients with active pulmonary TB. in practice this difficulty may give rise to 2 types of therapeutic error. traditional serological analysis of single circulating proteins is notoriously unreliable for TB diagnosis [7]. circulating proteins could provide an accessible readout of pathophysiological status. discovery of such discriminatory biomarkers could open the way for development of new point-of-care tests based on a lateral flow format such as dipsticks. all patients underwent the local standardized clinical workup for TB. this included up to 4 consecutive sputum samples for microscopy and culture. participation in the study did not change patients\u2019 routine clinical management. local incidence of TB in this population is 130 per 100,000/year. QuantiFERON\u00ae-TB gold in tube assay was performed on all participants. plasma was separated 3500 rpm, 10 minutes, aliquoted and frozen at 70\u00b0C at 6 hours following collection. spectra were generated at both high (3,000 nJ) and low (1,600 nJ) laser energies with mass focus set to 40,000 Da and 6,000 Da respectively. spectra were normalised by total ion current starting with a minimum mass/charge (m/z) of 2,500. spectra with normalisation factor outside mean 2 standard deviations were removed. six fractions were obtained from each sample eluting at pH 9.0, pH 7.0, pH 5.0, pH 4.0, pH 3.0 and organic phase. PCA encapsulates the covariance within a set of variables by extracting a ranked set of independent factors or principal components. study participants were recruited over a period of two years from adults over the age of 15 years attending 16 community TB clinics serving a population of 400,000. the local incidence of TB in this population is 130 per 100,000/year [16] and 95\u201397% of TB cases are HIV negative. patients with respiratory symptoms without active TB recruited if they had a persistent cough and one or more of the following clinical features. symptomatic controls had 1\u20134 sputum smears and cultures to exclude active TB. symptomatic controls were followed for 6 months to confirm cultures had not become positive. samples were coded, blinded and randomised before application onto weak cation exchange (CM10) ProteinChip\u00ae arrays (Bio-Rad) in duplicate. each proteinChip\u00ae included 1 quality control standard derived from a single healthy individual, placed at random. anion-exchange fractionation was carried out using the proteinChip\u00ae Serum Fractionation Kit (Bio-Rad) the first 3 components encompass a high proportion (95%) of informational content of a multivariate dataset. the first 3 components encompass a high proportion (95%) of informational content of a multivariate dataset. results were expressed as sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. 151 patients with active TB and 110 symptomatic controls were recruited. 48% of symptomatic controls had LTBI on the basis of a positive QuantiferonGold assay. RA had positive TSTs (>10 mm) compared with those without LTBI (62% vs. 30%, p0.001) there was a higher proportion of female patients among the symptomatic controls than among the TB group. the effects of this potential bias are discussed below. the QuantiferonGold test was indeterminate or unavailable on 13 symptomatic control patients. culture results from 4 patients were unavailable for 28 control patients. the spectra from patients with active TB (purple spheres) cluster relatively tightly together and are well separated from symptomatic control patients regardless of LTBI. this analysis does not clearly separate symptomatic controls with or without LTBI (blue and green spheres, respectively) nearly half of the symptomatic controls have LTBI (Table 1). the ROCs are derived from 1000 random train/test re-samplings of the data. error bars show standard deviations. Symptomatic LATENT Controls (40) 908 9010 9213** 0.920.08 ActiveTB (90) vs. Symptomatic NOLATENT Controls (40) 908 9010 9213** 0.920.08 The classifier performance is expressed as accuracy, sensitivity and specificity as percentages +/standard deviations obtained by 1000 train/test randomizations. separate comparisons were made between active TB and symptomatic controls. active TB could be distinguished from symptomatic controls with overall classifier accuracies of at least 87%. the main influence of LTBI among the symptomatic controls was to reduce classifier specificity, reflecting in a higher proportion of false positives. 151 patients with active TB and 110 symptomatic controls were recruited. 48% of symptomatic controls had LTBI on the basis of a positive quantitative assay. symptomatic controls had clinical features overlapping those of active TB patients. TST was not performed in patients with active TB. a parallel area of up-regulation is seen at 5 kDa. each vertical line represents an active TB patient or symptomatic control. areas where a protein is present in high abundance are seen in red and low abundance in green. mass spectra from 5 kDa to 12 kDa of four active TB and four symptomatic controls individuals. the ROC curves in Figure 5 summarize the performance of the classifiers in discriminating active from latent tuberculosis in symptomatic patients using the number of selected relevant m/z clusters. it was possible to distinguish patients with active TB from undifferentiated symptomatic controls with partially overlapping respiratory and constitutional symptoms with an overall accuracy of 85%. the area under the curve (AUC) is shown in the centre of each plot. the area under the curve (AUC) is shown in the centre of each plot. symptomatic controls 271 (98) 102 (10) 72 (8) 93 (4) 85 (8) 75 (12) 96 (12) ActiveTB vs. Symptomatic NOLATENT Controls 271 (57) 102 (16) 72 (0) 93 (8) 85 (0) 75 (8) 96 (5) Total number of mass/charge (m/z) clusters obtained from SELDI-ToF profiling of crude and pre-fractionated plasma. a new classifier was trained on male patients alone, to discriminate active TB from symptomatic controls. this classifier was still capable of classifying TB to an accuracy of approximately 80%. we also confirmed the presence of differential expression of the Serum Amyloid A (SAA, 11.5\u201311.8 kDa) and transthyretin (13.7\u201313.8 kDa) peak complexes. the use of TSTs in the diagnosis of active TB in high prevalence settings is greatly limited by its poor specificity for active TB as reactivity is also seen in LTBI, previous BCG vaccination and exposure to environmental mycobacteria. a diagnostic that overcome these limitations is urgently required and would be a major advance in the management of the global TB pandemic. proteomic fingerprinting has been applied in the past decade to a variety of disease states, particularly in the sphere of cancer diagnostics. the power of this approach is reflected by the recent granting of FDA approval of a novel blood test derived from a SELDI-based fingerprinting method for distinguishing malignant from benign ovarian tumours. TB obtained from pre-fractionated as compared to crude plasma spectra. the gold standards used for defining patient groups in this study are notoriously imperfect. the lack of an adequate gold standard for defining LTBI must be considered. biomarkers derived from this study into a lateral flow device or similar platform are the logical next step. the utility of defining proteomic patterns in TB may extend beyond diagnostics to provide new methods for monitoring treatment response and disease stage."}
