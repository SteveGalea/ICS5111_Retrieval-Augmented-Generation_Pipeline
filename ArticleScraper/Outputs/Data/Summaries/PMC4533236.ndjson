{"summary": "Background Molecular assays are the gold standard methods used to diagnose viral respiratory pathogens. introducing target independent next generation sequencing could resolve these issues and revolutionise respiratory viral diagnostics. commercial PCR based tests are available that overcome some of the pitfalls associated with in-house tests. introducing NGS into a diagnostic setting may revolutionize the investigation of respiratory infections. introducing NGS into a diagnostic setting may revolutionize the investigation of respiratory infections. RNA was purified from the reaction using RNAClean XP beads (Agencourt) and eluted in 15 l of water. second strand cDNA was synthesised and the reaction purified with Ampure XP beads. up to 24 sample libraries were pooled per sequencing run. 151 bp paired-end reads were generated on the Illumina MiSeq. high quality paired-end sequences were retained for downstream analyses. sample Total Reads % mapping to human reference PCR Ct Taxonomy Accession % reads mapping % genome covered Nucleotide mismatch 1C2 1107488 81.67 HRV 26.75 Enterovirus D-68 AB601885 1.46 14.9 1.4 2A3 1110727 88.23 HCoV 229E 18.14 HCoV 229E JX503060 9.63 99.8 0.6 2A4 311141 hMPV 25.68 hMPV-B KF530171 6.35 48.4 3.1 1C7 538412 69.88 HRV 24.93 HRV-A1 JN837694 4.76 87.4 1.2 1D1 1010455 59.82 HRV 20.68 HRV-A1 JN837694 32.03 100 1.9 1D4 1089553 23.19 HRV 19.81 HRV-A1 JN837694 V 19.39 HRV-B4 JN798573 39.08 99.7 1.4 1B2 638257 93.07 HRV 26.78 HRV-B92 FJ445169 2.53 56.4 7.5 1I6 1063930 57.27 HRV 29.11 HRV-C (UTR) JX129433 2.92 N/A 2.3 2A6 1056405 83.90 HRV 23.12 HRV-C11 EU84095 nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from adults with upper respiratory tract infections between may 2010 and October 2011. samples were collected as part of the VIDARIS trial, a random subset of which were used. the VTM was thawed at 37 \u00b0C and centrifuged at 1500 g for 10 min. total nucleic acids were extracted from 200 l of the supernatant.
