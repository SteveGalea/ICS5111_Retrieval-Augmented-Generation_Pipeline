{"summary": "female 11- to 14-wk-old C57BL/6J (B6) mice were used in all experiments. mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 2,2,2-tribromoethanol. both strains are mouse adapted and grow only in the murine respiratory tract. the plethysmographic measurements were breath frequency (counts/min), expiratory time (s), tidal volume (ml, calculated), and minute volume (ml/min, calculated) gas measurements determined the volume of oxygen consumed (Vo2) and the volume of carbon dioxide produced (both ml/min) sections stained for podoplanin using an Aperio ScanScope XT Slide Scanner. the percentage of lung field with reduced type I pneumocyte coverage was calculated by using Aperio's imageScope software. the percentage of lung field with reduced type I pneumocyte coverage was calculated by using an imageScope software. mice were given 30 l PBS intranasally containing 4 103 EID50 (egg infectious dose 50) and 1 106 EID50 A/Aichi/02/68 (HA, NA) both strains grow only in the murine respiratory tract. all procedures were done according to an institutionally approved IACUC protocol. gas measurements determined the volume of oxygen consumed (Vo2) and the volume of carbon dioxide (Vco2) produced (both ml/min) data analysis was performed by one-way ANOVA with Tukey's correction. five types of pulmonary lesions were scored histologically for H&E sections. 0 = no lesions; 1 = minimal, focal to multifocal, inconspicuous; 2 = mild, multifocal, prominent; 3 = moderate, multifocal, prominent; 5 = severe, extensive, and diffuse, with multilobar consolidation. both strains are mouse adapted and grow only in the murine respiratory tract. all procedures were done according to an institutionally approved IACUC protocol. all procedures were done according to an institutionally approved protocol. data analysis was performed by one-way ANOVA with Tukey's correction. mouse lungs underwent gravity inflation via tracheal infusion with 10% neutral-buffered formalin solution (vol/vol) after removal, lungs were immediately fixed in the same formalin solution for a minimum of 24 h before embedding, sectioning, and staining for conventional histopathology. tissue sections were stained for influenza virus as described above. whole lungs were homogenized in infection medium (double-distilled H2O, 0.3% BSA, 0.45% NaHCO3, 1 MEM) whole lungs were homogenized in infection medium (double-distilled H2O, 0.3% BSA, 0.45% NaHCO3, 1 MEM), and added to confluent monolayers of mCK cells. respiration patterns for nonlethal and lethal infections. we tracked the respiration of individual x31- and PR/8-infected mice for 14 days using unrestrained whole body plethysmography. breaths per minute (BPM), tidal volume, minute volume, and expiratory time on d2\u2013d15 in at least four mice per influenza strain. four to 6 mice per time point until d13. d13\u201315 PR/8, n = 2; x31, n = 3.

PR/8-infected mice exhibited decreased tidal volume, Vo2, Vco2 and MR by d9 through d12. by d15, however, the PR/8 survivors regained normal levels for all these measures. whole lungs were removed on d3, d6, d9, d12, and d15 after infection and H&E-stained sections were analyzed for five categories of lung lesions. x31 mice had slightly higher levels of alveolitis and interstitial pneumonitis than the PR/8 group on d6. bronchioles and alveoli were elevated through d30. blinded sections were also scored (scale 0\u20135) for virus staining. x31 was controlled by d9 whereas PR/8 virus could be found until d12. lung tissue removed from mice on noted days after infection was stained for influenza A (A and B) or analyzed for plaque-forming units (PFU) on MDCK cell monolayers. pathologist blindly scored tissues on a 1\u20135 scale for influenza A presence in bronchioles and alveoli (B) type I pneumocyte coverage of alveolar septa for the x31 group was 100% (d3), 99% (d6), and 97% (d10), with any type II pneumocyte loss reflecting the profile for type I cells in being limited to restricted foci. the d10 x31-infected lungs showed evidence of more advanced bronchiolar and alveolar repair. a pathologist blindly graded alveolar areas of lung tissues for intensity and localization of staining. Means SE are shown for 3\u20134 mice per virus examined per day. increased depletion of type I and type II alveolar epithelial cells (AEC) in uninfected or d10 postinfection mice. the two groups of infected mice began to converge on d3, and were well matched for most measures by d6. inspiratory time changed only at later times after x31 infection. tidal and minute volumes were significantly decreased in the PR/8 mice, beginning on d10 and d6, respectively. x31-infected mice returned to normal by d12, whereas PR/8-infected mice exhibited substantially lower levels beginning d9. the ppO2 levels of PR/8 survivors were still lower than normal on d30, suggesting the time PR/8-infected mice succumb to disease. x31 vs. x31-infected mice showed ppO2 throughout. arterial blood carbon dioxide remained constant. ppO2 remained constant. decreased tidal volume, Vo2, Vco2, and MR by d9 through d12. by d15, however, the PR/8 survivors regained normal levels for all these measures. d13\u201315 PR/8-infected mice consumed less oxygen and produced less carbon dioxide during times of peak illness. lethal infection is more severe in lethal infection after day 9. whole lungs were removed on d3, d6, d9, d12, and d15. x31 mice had slightly higher levels of alveolitis and interstitial pneumonitis than the PR/8 group on d6. whole lung tissue removed from mice on noted days after infection was stained with hematoxylin and eosin. pathologist scored tissues on a 1\u20135 scale for severity of bronchiolitis (A), peribronchiolitis (B), pervasculitis (C), alveolitis (D) and interstitial pneumonitis (E) pathologist blindly scored tissues on a 1\u20135 scale for influenza A presence in bronchioles (A) and alveoli (B). d3, d6, and d10 induced a progressive loss of type I pneumocytes, with coverage of alveolar septa declining from 95% (d3) to 91% (d6), to 60% on d10. 10 x31-infected lungs showed evidence of more advanced bronchiolar and alveolar repair in x31- and PR/8-infected mice. the presence of alveolar epithelial hyperplasia around some terminal airways was characterized by an absence of denuded bronchiolar airways. a pathologist blindly graded alveolar areas of lung tissues. representative images of uninfected mouse lung podoplanin staining (A), uninfected mouse lung surfactant C staining (B), d10 surfactant C staining in x31-infected mouse lungs (D), d10 surfactant C staining in x31-infected mouse lungs (D), and d10 surfactant C staining in PR/8-infected mouse lungs (F) were removed, sectioned tidal and minute volumes increased above uninfected mouse levels in the x31-infected group. Enhanced Pause and Pause are thought to be influenced by changes in respiratory patterns (2, 22) these patterns were similar to those of expiratory time. x31-infected mice returned to normal by d12, whereas PR/8-infected mice exhibited substantially lower levels beginning d9. ppO2 levels of PR/8 survivors were still lower than normal on d30, suggesting persistent pulmonary damage and compromised function. x31, n = 3\u20136 mice/time point; PR/8, n = 3\u20138 mice/time point.

Lung damage is more severe in lethal infection after day 9 and the virus persists longer. the x31 mice had slightly higher levels of alveolitis and interstitial pneumonitis than the PR/8 group on d6 (Fig. 5, A and E), whereas PR/8 infection caused slightly elevated levels of bronchiolitis on d3 when such damage was maximal. blinded sections were also scored (scale 0\u20135) for virus staining. alveolitis (A) d12 P 0.05; d15, d20, d30 P 0.0005; bronchiolitis (B) d3 P 0.05; perivasculitis (C) d15 P 0.05, d20 P 0.0005, d30 P 0.05; peribronchiolitis (D) d9 P 0.0005, d15 P 0.005, d20 P 0.0005; interstitial pneumonitis ( Podoplanin/T1a is a known marker for type I pneumocytes.

DISCUSSION Severe influenza virus infections result in substantial respiratory incapacitation. they have been shown to induce significant alveolar epithelial cell death in patients, animal models, and in vitro cell cultures. analysis of data set from d9\u2013d12 time reveals two curious findings. first, despite the absence of virus at d9, the x31 mice had high alveolitis scores indicative of continued inflammation. however, this had little effect on respiration or gas exchange and did not lead to the severe loss of type I pneumocytes. loss of type I cells could compromise the rapid repair of the alveolar epithelial lining and favor the development of interstitial and intra-alveolar fibrosis. edema can be attributable to the epithelial cell loss. study was funded by NIAID contract HHSN272200800058C, American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities (ALSAC), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Grant F32HL099168. no conflicts of interest, financial or otherwise, are declared by author(s)"}
