{"summary": "bortezomib (Velcade) was approved as treatment for multiple myeloma in 2003. since then, bortezomib has also been approved for the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma. ins have pleiotropic effects and are used to treat a variety of diseases. proteasome inhibition causes side effects such as peripheral neuropathy, myelosuppression, nausea, hypersensibility and increased susceptibility to infection. a selective immunoproteasome inhibitor PR957 was shown to prevent experimental colitis and interfere with arthritis in a mouse model. inhibition of DUBs as a novel approach to treat cancer, neurodegenerative diseases and viral infection has also been molecular targets for inhibitor development in recent years. members of the DUB family known to contribute to neoplastic transformation include USP1 (Fanconi anaemia), USP2 (prostate cancer), DUB3 (breast cancer), USP4 (adenocarcinoma), USP7 (prostate cancer, non-small-cell lung a HBX 41,108 is a functionalised cyano-indenopyrazine derivative that inhibits several DUBs, including USP7, and stabilises p53 in a nongenotoxic manner. an independent screen recently identified compound P005091 and analogues such as P045204 and P022077 as USP7 inhibitors. USP8 (UBPY) and endocytosis As a function of its key role in regulation of receptor endocytosis and trafficking, USP8 (UBPY) interacts with a number of clinically relevant cancer targets, including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) compounds unrelated to prostaglandins, but also containing cross-conjugated,-unsaturated ketones and accessible -carbons, also inhibit isopeptidase activity. the mechanism of inhibition by J-series prostaglandins is most likely based on the nucleophilic addition of a DUB thiol to the endocyclic -carbon of a compound and the electrophilic accessibility of prostaglandin. punaglandins, such as punaglandin 4, are also more potent inhibitors of cellular DUB activity than the J-series prostaglandins. the proposed mechanism for this enhanced inhibitor activity is the presence of an electronegative Cl substituent at the -position of,-unsaturated carbonyls that increases the reactivity towards the nucleophilic addition of the DUB catalytic cysteine thiol group. USP14 has been previously linked to neurodegenerative disease. loss of USP14 leads to an ataxic neurological phenotype in mice. PLpro blocks IRF3-dependent antiviral responses, indicating its relevance to key infectious processes and viral evasion of host innate immune responses. PLpro blocks SARS-CoV viral replication without measurable cytotoxic effects. HBX 41,108 is a functionalised cyano-indenopyrazine derivative that inhibits several DUBs, including USP7, and stabilises p53 in a nongenotoxic manner. an independent screen recently identified compound P005091 and analogues such as P045204 and P022077. USP8 (UBPY) interacts with a number of clinically relevant cancer targets, including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) Knockdown of USP8 results in the accumulation of ubiquitylated EGFR in endosomes. the inhibitory effect of prostaglandins is exemplified by 15-deoxy-12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) (Fig. 2, compound 4), which inhibits the activities of UCHL-3 (Ref. 54) and UCH-L1 (Refs 56, 57) IU1-mediated inhibition of USP14 indirectly accelerates proteasomal degradation of proteins, such as tau and ataxin-3, both of which are involved in neurodegenerative diseases. IU1 or other USP14-directed small-molecule inhibitors could be used to eliminate these toxic proteins. general DUB inhibitors WP1130 (degrasyn) is a derivative of AG490, a small-molecule compound that blocks Janus-activated kinase 2 (JAK2) activity. in cells, WP1130 treatment induces accumulation of polyubiquitylated conjugates. PLpro blocks IRF3-dependent antiviral responses, indicating its relevance to key infectious processes and viral evasion of host innate immune responses. GRL0617 induces a conformational change in PLpro, which effectively inactivates this DUB. the best characterised substrate of HDM2 is p53, which is targeted to the proteasome by HDM2. inhibition of HDM2 leads to activation of the p53 pathway. the crystal structure of HDM2 bound to p53-derived peptide reveals a deep hydrophobic cleft in HDM2 necessary for p53 binding. bortezomib is currently in Phase I clinical trials for the treatment of solid tumours and haematological malignancies. small-molecule inhibitors against ubiquitin/Ubl-conjugating enzymes include nutlin-3a (10), RITA (11), MI-219 (12), JNJ-26854165 (13), chlorofusin (14) and chalcone (AM114) (15), which specifically interfere with the HDM2\u2013p53 or HDM the spiro-oxindoles exemplified by MI-63 and MI-219 (Fig. 3, compound 12) and the chromenotriazolopyrimidines were also reported to be effective nonpeptidomimetic small-molecule inhibitors of the HDM2\u2013p53 interaction. another mode of inhibition of HDM2 is by blocking its association with the proteasome. hexylitaconic acid impairs p53\u2013HDM2 interactions in a dose-dependent manner. its derivatives, including a monomethyl ester, a dihydro derivative and a dihydro derivative monomethyl ester, showed no inhibitory activity. boronic acid binds to lysine residues Lys51 and Lys94 of HDM2. ubiquitin E3 ligase containing Skp2 determines substrate specificity. upregulation of SCFSkp2 is associated with decreased p27Kip1 levels. therefore, compounds directly targeting SCFSkp2 represent potential drugs for cancer therapy. CRBN E3 ligase targeted by thalidomide Cereblon (CRBN) damaged DNA-binding protein 1 (DDB1) and Cul4A form an E3 ligase complex that is important for embryonic development. the complex is targeted by thalidomide, a clinically approved drug for the treatment of multiple myeloma, leprosy and inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn disease) nutlin-3a belongs to a class of tetrasubstituted imidazolines. it acts as a competitive inhibitor, blocking the interaction of p53 with HDM2. it effectively eliminates tumour xenografts in mice, causing no measurable abnormalities in animals. the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 is targeted by PYR-41 (Ref. 95) and the NEDD8-activating enzyme NAE1 is inhibited by MLN4924 (18) all molecular targets are associated with disease pathologies, in particular cancer. microbial extracts derived from fermented microorganisms were screened to discover new compounds that antagonise the HDM2\u2013p53 interaction. chlorofusin has a nine-residue cyclic peptide containing an l-ornithine side chain linked to a highly functionalised tricyclic chromophore. boronic acid binds to lysine residues Lys51 and Lys94 of HDM2. the detailed mechanism of the cytotoxic activity of chalcones remains to be determined. the detailed mechanism of the cytotoxic activity of chalcones remains to be determined. p2 ligase complex leads to ubiquitin-dependent accumulation of substrates for SCFSkp2 E3 ligase activity, such as p27. this leads to ubiquitin-dependent accumulation of substrates for SCFSkp2 E3 ligase activity, such as p27. recently, two additional examples of E3 inhibitors were reported. thalidomide was found to have teratogenic side effects by the perturbation of embryonic development. muRF1 E3 ligase inhibition and muscular atrophy muRF1 is a key effector enzyme of muscular atrophy. a novel modulator of the E3 ubiquitin ligase, P013222, inhibited muRF1 autoubiquitylation and myosin heavy-chain ubiquitylation. thiol ester activates the C-terminus of ubiquitin for a subsequent nucleophilic attack. blocking this reaction could therefore be used to inhibit ubiquitin conjugation. in vitro studies suggest knockdown of E1 ligase results in lower levels of protein ubiquitylation. the effects of PYZD-4409 have also been studied in a mouse model of leukaemia. this study underlines the importance of E1 as a potential drug target in leukaemia and possibly other cancers. neural precursor cell-expressed developmentally downregulated-8 (NEDD8) is a ubiquitin-like protein with the highest homology to ubiquitin. NEDD8 primarily functions in the regulation of E3 ubiquitin ligases. cullins are scaffold components of the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligases that control proteasomal degradation of proteins involved in the cell cycle, transcriptional regulation or signal transduction. the functional mechanism of MLN4924 involves formation of the MLN4924\u2013NEDD8 covalent adduct. this is similar to the first intermediate of the reaction catalysed by the NEDD8-activating enzyme, thus efficiently inhibiting the NEDD8 E1 enzyme. there is concern that inhibition of 300 E3 ligases might lead to serious side effects in a clinical setting. inhibitors such as PYR-41, Nutlin-3a, Compound A, P013222 and SCF-I2 have proved successful in the preclinical stage. it remains to be determined whether small molecules are required to specifically target only one molecule to be clinically useful or if, in a manner similar to medically relevant kinase inhibitors, molecules with broader specificities might exhibit clinical efficacy."}
