{"summary": "lectins have been categorized into many families conventionally designated as calnexin, C-type, L-type, P-type/mannose-6-phosphate receptors (MPRs), I-type/siglecs, M-type, F-type (absent in mammals), R-type, F-box, chitinase-like lectins, galectins and intelectins. the diversity of locations and functions indicates the importance of cose F-type sequence motif Extracellular, Cell membrane No F-box lectin GlcNAc2 F-box sequence motif Cytoplasm No Chitinase-like lectin Chito-oligosaccharides TIM (Triose-phosphate isomerase) barrel-like structure. recognition of a specific carbohydrate structure is considered to be a common and effective method for distinguishing between self and non-self factors in animals. extracellular lectins, including C-type, R-type, I-type/siglecs lectins and galectins, are secreted into the extracellular milieu or are localized to the plasma membrane. intracellular lectins, such as the calnexin family, are located in luminal compartments of the secretory pathway and function in the trafficking, sorting and maturation of glycoproteins. the binding specificity of these two groups is mediated by diverse residues flanking the conserved cis-proline in the long loop region. previous studies have demonstrated that interchange of the E-P-N and Q-P-D sequences is sufficient to switch the mannose- and galactose-binding specificity. however, several lectins are exceptions to this rule. MBL is a member of the collectin family, a subgroup of C-type lectins. the molecule contains four domains that are standard for collectin family proteins. the native functional form of MBL is a hexamer; however, the dimers and trimers do not have biological activity. the mechanism of viral elimination by the MBL-based complement cascade is still unclear. the mechanism of viral elimination by the MBL-based complement cascade is still unclear. three possible mechanisms have been proposed for MBL-mediated viral elimination. dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) functions as a key attachment factor used for the recognition and uptake of multiple viruses. MBL can prevent interaction between HIV and DC-SIGN, thereby inhibiting the HIV infection of T cells, which is mediated by DC-SIGN. SP-D binds to IAVs and thereby inhibits virus attachment and entry by viral aggregation. also controls IAV infection in human by activating neutrophil chemoattraction. SP-A has been reported to bind fusion (F) and adherence (G) glycoproteins on surfaces of RSV virions. DC-SIGN/L-SIGN are capable of binding to the surface proteins of HIV [28], cytomegalovirus [30], DENV [32], WNV [52,53], Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [54,55,56], HCV [57,58], Ebola virus [29] and MARV [54] and consequently facilitating viral entry. the recognition of viral surface glycoproteins by MR is also beneficial CLEC5A/MDL-1 (myeloid DAP12-associating lectin) is a C-type lectin associated with DAP12 (12-kDa DNAX-activating protein) on myeloid cells such as monocytes, macrophages and neutrophils. the association between CLEC5A and DENV does not result in viral entry, but rather induces DAP12-mediated immune signaling to stimulate the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines langerin is capable of directly capturing HIV-1 and sequentially degrading it in BGs to promote T cell elimination of HIV-1 infection. a recent study reported that langerin is a natural barrier for HIV-1 transmission among Langerhans cells. a large number of host proteins are abundantly glycosylated. galectins Galectins are a group of secreted proteins that associate with specific cell surface glycans containing beta-galactosides. galectins accumulate directly beneath the plasma membrane and are involved in the establishment of membrane-bound vesicles that pinch off before release outside the cell. galectins then bind to glycoconjugates on the plasma membrane or remain in the extracellular matrix. galectin-1 binds to NiV-F, a viral envelope glycoprotein of Nipah virus (NiV) to reduce the NiV-F-mediated fusion of endothelial cells and thereby inhibit NiV-induced syncytium formation. the role of galectin-3 in viral infection has been elucidated by several studies. calnexin and calreticulin are lectin-like, membrane-bound molecular chaperones that associate with newly synthesized proteins in the ER. maturation of virus-encoded proteins occurs in the ER, and calnexin family proteins have been shown to transiently interact with multiple viral proteins that consequently undergo rapid maturation. maturation of the viral S protein due to its interaction with calnexin is essential for the formation of infective exin binds to the ER-associated viral transmembrane protein NSP4, a nonstructural glycoprotein that acts as a toxin capable of inducing diarrhea in animals. lectin-like calnexin proteins interact with viral components to facilitate viral assembly and protein maturation. human herpes simplex virus (HSV) glycoprotein D (gD) binds to both CI-MPR and CD-MPR. MPRs were also found on surfaces of mammalian cells as serving as putative cellular receptors for HSV entry and cell-cell viral spread. chemo- or immuno-blocking MPRs was shown to inhibit HSV entry and the production of HSV plaques in monkey cells. in the absence of ERGIC-53, viral particles can be formed but are noninfectious. there are some other lectin classes in animals, e.g., M-type, R-type, I-type, Chitinase-like, F-box lectins and intelectins. sequence of the core motif is E-P-N for mannose-binding and Q-P-D for galactose-binding specificity. previous studies have demonstrated that interchange of the sequences is sufficient to switch the mannose- and galactose-binding specificity. however, several lectins are exceptions to this rule. the molecule contains four domains that are standard for collectin family proteins. the native functional form of MBL is a hexamer; however, the dimers and trimers do not have biological activity. at least a tetramer form is needed to activate the complement cascade. specific recognition of these viral particles by MBL is a central event for activation of the lectin-based complement cascade. the mechanism of viral elimination by the MBL-based complement cascade is still unclear. a study reported that MBL can prevent interaction between HIV and DC-SIGN, thereby inhibiting the HIV infection of T cells. MBL interacts with the viral envelope glycoproteins of Ebola and Marburg viruses (MARV), resulting in the impairment of viral internalization by blocking virus-DC-SIGN interaction. SP-A has been reported to bind fusion (F) and adherence (G) glycoproteins on the surfaces of RSV virions, resulting in opsonization to reduce infection by enhancing viral uptake by peripheral blood mononuclear cells. SP-D also directly interacts with RSV surface G protein to modulate host immune responses to control RSV infection. severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [54,55,56], HCV [57,58], Ebola virus [29] and MARV [54] and consequently facilitating viral entry. only mannosylated Envelope glycoproteins on DENV, but not E proteins with complex glycosylation, have been shown to interact with DC-SIGN-expressing cells. the association between CLEC5A and DENV does not result in viral entry, but rather induces DAP12-mediated immune signaling to stimulate the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. the blocking of CLEC5A in mice can significantly reduce the infiltration of JEV-harboring leukocytes into the central nervous system. however, the intracellular modules determine the role of C-type lectins in viral infection. langerin is capable of directly capturing HIV-1 and sequentially degrading it in BGs to promote T cell elimination of HIV-1 infection. a large number of host proteins are abundantly glycosylated. microbial recognition by lectins relies on the mechanism for distinguishing carbohydrate structures between self and non-self. the molecule contains four domains that are standard for collectin family proteins. the native functional form of MBL is a hexamer; however, the dimers and trimers do not have biological activity. at least a tetramer form is needed to activate the complement cascade. specific recognition of viral particles by MBL is a central event for activation of the lectin-based complement cascade. the mechanism of viral elimination by the MBL-based complement cascade is still unclear. three possible mechanisms have been proposed for MBL-mediated viral elimination. a study reported that MBL can prevent interaction between HIV and DC-SIGN, thereby inhibiting the HIV infection of T cells.

SP-A has been reported to bind fusion (F) and adherence (G) glycoproteins on the surfaces of RSV virions. SP-D also directly interacts with RSV surface G protein to modulate host immune responses to control RSV infection. both DC-SIGN and L-SIGN are trans-membrane proteins. differential glycosylation patterns of viral surface proteins influence viral recognition by DC-SIGN/L-SIGN. only mannosylated Envelope glycoproteins on DENV, but not E proteins with complex glycosylation, have been shown to interact with DC-SIGN-expressing cells. MR is expressed in multiple immune cells, including macrophages and dendritic cells. CLEC5A/MDL-1 (myeloid DAP12-associating lectin) is a C-type lectin associated with DAP12 (12-kDa DNAX-activating protein) on myeloid cells such as monocytes, macrophages and neutrophils. the association between CLEC5A and DENV does not result in viral entry, but rather induces DAP12-mediated immune signaling to stimulate the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines Langerin is capable of directly capturing HIV-1 and sequentially degrading it in BGs to promote T cell elimination of HIV-1 infection. langerin functions as an attachment factor to facilitate Measles virus (MV) infection in Langerhans cells. galectins are a group of secreted proteins that associate with specific cell surface glycans containing beta-galactosides. they accumulate directly beneath the plasma membrane and are involved in the establishment of membrane-bound vesicles that pinch off before release outside the cell. galectins then bind to glycoconjugates on the plasma membrane or remain in the extracellular matrix. -1 binds to NiV-F, a viral envelope glycoprotein of Nipah virus (NiV) to reduce the NiV-F-mediated fusion of endothelial cells and thereby inhibit NiV-induced syncytium formation. galectin-1 has also been reported to be a susceptibility factor for viral entry. calnexin and calreticulin are membrane-bound molecular chaperones that associate with newly synthesized proteins in the ER. calnexin and calreticulin preferentially interact with glycoproteins that carry monoglucosylated N-linked oligosaccharides. maturation of virus-encoded proteins occurs in the ER. the lectin-like calnexin proteins interact with viral components to facilitate viral assembly and protein maturation. the lectin-like calnexin proteins interact with viral components to facilitate viral assembly and protein maturation. MPRs were found on surfaces of mammalian cells as serving as putative cellular receptors for HSV entry and cell-cell viral spread. chemo- or immuno-blocking MPRs were shown to inhibit HSV entry and the production of HSV plaques in monkey cells. mouse cells lacking both CI-MPR and CD-MPR remain sensitive to HSV infection. viral particles can be formed but are noninfectious. there are some other lectin classes in animals, e.g., M-type, R-type, I-type, Chitinase-like, F-box lectins and intelectins. many lectin homologues have been identified and reported in invertebrates. a recent study on lectins in aedes aegypti initially assessed lectin functions in viral infections of arthropods. tens of C-type lectins were identified in Aedes [122,123] and Anopheles [124] mosquitoes, and most are soluble forms. a recent study has identified a C-type lectin in the shrimp Marsupenaeus japonicus that interacts with an envelope protein of white spot syndrome virus. a cell-surface calreticulin serves as a membrane receptor that facilitates viral entry in a cholesterol-dependent manner. the role might not be limited to WNV/DENV in mosquito and WSSV in shrimp but might extend to other virus infections in arthropods. the combined use of UDA with HHA and GNA showed broad anti-viral activity against four serotypes of DENV in monocyte-derived dendritic cells by preventing virus attachment. an interesting monoclonal antibody, 2G12, which interacts with specific, highly conserved glycosylation sites on HIV envelop protein gp120 shows a broad anti-HIV neutralizing activity. lectins are employed as attachment factors that recruit viral particles to the cell membrane to enhance viral entry. some intracellular lectins, such as calnexin and ERGIC-53, function as susceptibility factors associated with virus-encoded proteins to facilitate viral replication or assembly.
