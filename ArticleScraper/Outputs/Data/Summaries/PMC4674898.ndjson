{"summary": "data analytic challenges in the realm of public health surveillance. results We demonstrate the utility of ORBiT in automatically extracting a small number of spatial and temporal patterns during the 2009-2010 pandemic. the patterns show that the south-eastern regions of the us were widely affected by the H1N1 flu pandemic. public health surveillance is a big data problem. it can serve as an effective vehicle for monitoring epidemiology of various health problems, including infectious (e.g., flu, West Nile Virus, Ebola, etc.) and chronic (e.g., diabetes, cancer, etc.) health conditions, documenting impact of interventions and/or tracking progress of specific health goals. developing effective public health surveillance systems is a priority. current platforms for biosurveillance make use of event-based, unstructured data to monitor for emerging infectious disease spread within geographically distributed populations. a detailed overview of these systems is further described in Shmueli and Burkhom [13] the availability of electronic health records (EHR) and electronic healthcare reimbursement claims (or briefly, claims) [28-30] have proven valuable resources for collecting, monitoring and analyzing public health-related questions. privacy and security-related concerns, data disparity across diverse/individual clinics/hospitals, as well as the sheer complexity involved in processing such large-scale structured datasets can pose significant data analytic challenges for even simple public health surveillance tasks. the complex etiologies of diseases pose special challenges in developing analytic tools to monitor them. for example, the symptoms of the common flu and a serious outbreak such as west Nile virus can be very similar. however, teasing out these symptoms from a context specific search of Twitter and other social media data can be quite challenging. our analysis of these datasets shows that a small number of distinct temporal patterns govern how the 2009-2010 influenza pandemic spread across the country. these patterns depict the process by which the H1N1 flu spread across the entire country in distinct waves, each with its own unique temporal and spatial signature. a detailed overview of these systems and their applications is further described in Shmueli and Burkhom. these systems include tools for natural language processing (NLP) for parsing unstructured textual data, basic statistical analyses tools, time-series counts/ratios and geographic information system (GIS) based visualization. the availability of electronic health records (EHR) [26,27] and electronic healthcare reimbursement claims (or briefly, claims) [28-30] have proven to be valuable resources for collecting, monitoring and analyzing public health-related questions. privacy and security-related concerns, data disparity across diverse/individual clinics/hospitals can pose significant data analytic challenges for even simple public health surveillance tasks. the Oak Ridge biosurveillance toolkit (ORBiT) is being developed as a machine learning platform. it processes both direct and indirect data sources by integrating insights from heterogeneous datasets for answering public health surveillance-related queries. the toolkit can also simultaneously examine heterogeneous data sets to identify emerging patterns of disease spread across geographically distributed regions. a small number of distinct temporal patterns govern how the pandemic spread across the country. we extract intrinsic multi-scale patterns from the claims data, moving successively from local to regional to national patterns. this study provides a summary of ORBiT capabilities and how it can be used as a scalable platform for public health surveillance. the claims data was processed for flu-related records using the definition shown below: \u2022 flu case definition: include only hospital diagnosed cases of the flu. the definition of the flu corresponds to hospital diagnosed cases of the flu, which provides a specific count in terms of the number of flu cases recorded within any zip code. the data is usually reported every day with claims coming into the data warehouse continuously. the CDC maintains information on patient visits to health care providers for influenza like illnesses (ILI) the data reported every week consists of the total number of patient visits as well as the total number of patients with ILI-like symptoms organized by age groups. the CDC then baselines these reports based on the state population and defines several metrics for individual geographic regions. a log-linear model estimates the probability that a query is related to ILI. this model was validated across CDC-observed ILI percentages and made available for the public from http://www.google.org/flutrends/us/#US. we used non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) as a technique to extract low-rank approximations from the claims data. given a data matrix A with non-negative values, Nz Nt finds low-rank approximation (s) of the form A = WH, where W (Nz s) captures spatial patterns. claims data consists of over 1 billion claims collected annually and represents over 165 million unique patients. the claims data consists of over 3 billion claims collected annually and represents over 165 million unique patients. the data was loaded/processed with the IMS Health data warehouses. we defined local metropolitan areas (for cities) and the different geographic regions based on an aggregation of data from these individual zip codes. the data reported every week consists of the total number of patient visits as well as the total number of patients with ILI-like symptoms organized by age groups. IMS Health collects over 55-60 million claims every week. claims data consists of over 1 billion claims collected annually. the claims data was processed for flu-related records using the definition shown below: \u2022 flu case definition: include only hospital diagnosed cases of the flu, namely ICD9 codes 486XX and 488XX. the definition of the flu corresponds to hospital diagnosed cases of the flu, which provides a specific count in terms of the number of flu cases recorded within any zip code. the CDC maintains information on patient visits to health care providers for influenza like illnesses (ILI), which consists of more than 2,900 outpatient healthcare providers. the data reported every week consists of the total number of patient visits as well as the total number of patients with ILI-like symptoms organized by age groups. a log-linear model estimates the probability that a query is related to ILI. this model was validated across CDC-observed ILI percentages and made available for the public from http://www.google.org/flutrends/us/#US. we used non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) as a technique to extract low-rank approximations from the claims data. given a data matrix A with non-negative values, with dimensions Nz Nt, NMF finds low-rank approximation (s) of the form A = WH. both CDC ILINet and GFT data are known to be correlated [14,18] but both datasets correspond to different modalities. we hypothesize that the IMS Health claims data will closely match the temporal trends observed from the data. IMS health claims, CDC ILINet and google flu trends are plotted together with IMS claims data (black line) the temporal trends for the entire US are plotted in the center, followed by the 10 human and health services regions shown around the US (HHS-I to HHS-X) in all the cases, the agreement between IMS claims data, GFT and CDC ILINet data is quantified by the correlation coefficient. claims data is dependent on the primary care physician's reporting of transactions. the reported number of cases within the claims data can be regarded as upper-bound estimates of the true infection. even across different HHS regions, the claims data consistently presents higher number of ILI cases compared to CDC ILInet and GFT. codes within each HHS region for which claims data is available vary from a minimum of 28.4% to a maximum of 58.4%. the reporting from the claims data is fairly consistent across these regions for any given year, as reflected by the total number of diagnostic records available at these regions. the reconstruction error rates of both PCAorig and PCAscram at subspace around s = 12. we use a smaller subspace (s = 5) to describe the 2009 H1N1 pan- demic. s beyond 12 is only explaining noise within the dataset. temporal patterns is left shifted - indicating a lag period in the ILI incidence rates observed across the different geographic regions. notably, H1 shows a peak in ILI incidence around day 206-210, corresponding to a time period of Oct 24, 2009; H2 shows peak about a week earlier (Oct 18, 2009) followed by H3 peaking around Sep 28, 2009 and H4 peaking around Aug 19, 2009. model captures nation-wide, state-wide and zip code specific behaviors observed during the pandemic flu season. each Wi depicts how the flu encompassed the entire nation. darker colors of red correspond to a higher flu prevalence in the region. lighter colors (orange, yellow, green and blue) represent a lower flu prevalence. state-wide panel shows how flu patterns uniquely affected different counties/regions. TN was widely affected by the H1N1 pandemic as a south-eastern state. a small subset of zip codes act as bridge regions. only the area of Bartlett and Collierville show the presence of early and late fly patterns (corresponding with the spatial pattern W5). a dominant pattern is defined as a spatial pattern that is prevalent in a specific zip code based on the maximum Wi value(s) within the zip codes that constitute the state (or HHS region) states like north Dakota, Pennsylvania and others show a dominant, single spatial pattern. states such as Kentucky and Tennessee act as bridge regions in the spread of the pandemic. both CDC ILINet and GFT data are known to be correlated [14,18] but both datasets correspond to different modalities. IMS Health claims data will closely match the temporal trends observed from the CDC ILINet and GFT data. the total incidence of the 2009-2010 pandemic flu is plotted together with IMS claims data (black line) the temporal trends for the entire US are plotted in the center, followed by the 10 human and health services (HHS-I to HHS-X) the agreement between IMS claims data, GFT and CDC ILINet data is quantified by the correlation coefficient, depicted on the side of each panel. the claims data is dependent on the primary care physician's reporting of transactions, which can vary across the nation. even across different HHS regions, the claims data consistently presents higher number of ILI cases compared to the CDC ILInet and GFT. zip codes within each HHS region for which claims data is available vary from a minimum of 28.4% to a maximum of 58.4%. claims data provides similar insights into public health surveillance as traditional sources such as CDC ILINet. we used the strict definition of the flu (ICD9 codes: 486XX and 488XX) the temporal trends for the entire US are plotted in the center, followed by the 10 HHS Regions shown around the US (HHS-I to HHS-X) the agreement between IMS claims data, GFT and CDC ILINet data is quantified by the correlation coefficient, depicted on the side of each panel. the claims data consistently presents higher number of ILI cases compared to the CDC ILInet and GFT. except for HHS-I and HHS-II, all the other regions consistently show that the peak of the pandemic occurred around the Oct-Nov 2009 time-frame. non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) identifies distinct spatial and temporal patterns from the 2009-2010 pandemic H1N1 flu season. the total number of zip codes with reported flu cases (Nz) was 14,098 and we used Nt to be 365 days. instead of examining weekly reports, we used a daily resolution to fully leverage the claims data. we use a smaller subspace (s = 5) to describe the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. this is mainly due to the fact that we wanted a simpler representation of this high dimensional space and traded the interpretability of a lower dimensional representation for the complexity of patterns when s = 12. we have chosen to detail our analysis with a subspace size of 5. H5 corresponds to an early flu outbreak observed in the early-middle spring time. the early peak of the ILI-incidence is followed by a secondary peak in and around the same time of H1, indicating that the likely presence of an early flu season also influenced the late peaks observed in the fall season. each Wi vector provides a specific spatial pattern during the 2009-2010 pandemic flu season. the spatial pattern W5 depicts flu prevalence only within large metropolitan areas and southern Florida. the nation wide panels depict how W1 pattern is widespread throughout the US followed by progressively moving down south (W4 ). this analysis can be extended out towards the state and nation-wide areas. TN was widely affected by the H1N1 pandemic. as a south-eastern state, TN was widely affected by the H1N1 pandemic. a cluster of three zip codes in the area corresponding to Bartlett showed very little flu. a dominant pattern is defined as a spatial pattern that is prevalent in a specific zip code based on the maximum Wi value(s) within the zip codes that constitute the state (or HHS region) a small number of regions within the us act as bridge regions for the 2009-2010 H1N1-flu season. states such as Kentucky and Tennessee act as bridge regions in the spread of the pandemic. the entire southeast acts as a bridge region showing the presence of two or more patterns simultaneously occurring within 50% of the zip codes. the entire southeast acts as a bridge region showing the presence of two or more patterns simultaneously occurring within 50% of the zip codes.

ORBiT can be used in other contexts including extracting and analyzing emerging, indirect datasets for public health surveillance. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors declare that they have no competing interests. the full contents of the supplement are available online at http://www.biomedcentral.com/bmcbioinformatics/supplements/16/S17."}
