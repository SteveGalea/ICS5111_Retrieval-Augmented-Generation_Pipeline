{"summary": "blood and nasal swab specimens were obtained from all camels. samples were grouped according to the camels\u2019 ages rather than sampling site. RT-PCR testing of nasal swab specimens showed a considerable prevalence of MERS-CoV RNA among all dromedaries 4 years of age but particularly in calves. ELISA used a recombinant MERS-CoV globular spike (S1) domain as described by Drosten et al. (11), modified by the reagent manufacturer. the anti-human conjugate was replaced by an anti-camel conjugate. the test was not selective for IgG. virus was detected in 11/15 (73.3%) calves, and on sampling day 8, it was detected in 4/15 (26.7%) calves. this overall pattern was suggestive of a recent infection peak in the flock that was already on the decline at the time of sampling. we sequenced genomes of 9 virus isolates from dromedaries on the 3 farms. phylogeny of full genomes showed that all viruses clustered according to their place of origin. the phylogenetic position of 1 of these clades suggested recent separation from viruses circulating in the eastern part of Saudi Arabia. trees were annotated by using the last 75% of all generated trees in TreeAnnotator v.1.5 (http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/TreeAnnotator/) and visualized with FigTree v.1.4 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/). Statistical support of grouping based on Bayesian posterior probabilities is shown at all nodes (95% highest posterior density; we did not design our study to cover the duration of virus shedding in young dromedaries. our results suggest excretion to be short lived in individual camels. shedding occurred for 35 days after virus inoculation (8). -CoV transmission."}
