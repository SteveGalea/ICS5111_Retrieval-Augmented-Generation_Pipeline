{"summary": "TEXT Avian astroviruses (AstV) are classified within the genus Avastrovirus and are known to cause infection in poultry leading to economic losses to farms. these viruses have been associated with avian diseases, including enteritis in turkeys, chickens, and guinea fowl, mild growth depression and nephritis in chickens, and hepatitis in ducklings. avian astroviruses in poultry have not always been associated with diseases. infection of avian astroviruses in these hosts has not always been associated with diseases. the significance to the astrovirus ecology of interspecies transmission requires further investigation. RNA was extracted from bird dropping samples and swabs kept in viral transport medium using a viral RNA extraction kit (Qiagen) the extracted RNA was screened for astroviruses using a previously described pan-astrovirus reverse transcription-PCR assay targeting the RdRp gene (5). astrovirus was detected in 47 of a total of 658 wild aquatic bird dropping samples collected in Mai Po marshes. positive samples were detected from all sampling trips performed biweekly in a 3-month period, and the positive rates of each sampling occasion ranged from 2.8% to 14.7%. all the astrovirus-positive samples were subjected to DNA bar coding to identify the host species. none of these aquatic bird species found positive for astrovirus in Hong Kong and Cambodia had previously been reported as hosts for astrovirus infection. bird dropping samples collected at Mai Po were reverse transcription-PCR positive for astrovirus Speciesa No. of astV-positive samples (% of total) the majority of rescued birds sampled by cloacal swabs at KFBG in Hong Kong were resident nonmigratory wild birds. the majority of rescued birds sampled by cloacal swabs were resident nonmigratory wild birds. astrovirus was detected in 10.1% (11/109) of cloacal swabs of chickens collected in Hong Kong and 9.6% (27/282) of chickens collected in Sri Lanka. no positives were detected in cloacal swabs from quails, ducks, and geese. novel viruses were detected from a black-faced spoonbill and a common greenshank in Hong Kong and from a lesser whistling duck in Cambodia. the findings reveal a previously unrecognized and large diversity of avastroviruses in wild aquatic birds. group 1, TAstV, chicken AstV GA2011, duck AstV DA08, TAstV3, and TAstV2. group 3, MPJ0552/northern shoveler, MPJ1561/northern shoveler, and MPJ0126/common teal. all group 1 avian astroviruses were detected from hosts. five (TAstV1, TAstV2, DuAstV, DuHV3, and CAstV) of six previously known avian astroviruses are in this group. subgroup 1.1 includes only one previously known member, TAstV1. viruses closely related to TAstV1 were repeatedly detected from our chicken samples. group 2 avian astroviruses detected from wild bird samples were all collected from birds of the orders of Charadriiformes, Pelecaniformes, and Columbiformes. Previously known members in this group are avian nephritis virus (ANV), which was detected primarily from chickens, and pigeon astroviruses reported by Kofstad and Jonassen in 2011 (16). group 3 astrovirus sequences formed 6 distinct clades in our phylogenetic analysis. the RdRp gene sequence identities of these 6 distinct clades range from 0.643 to 0.761. the 3\u2032-half genomes of 6 novel avian astroviruses were sequenced from representative samples. novel viruses detected from wild birds in this study are indicated in bold type. TAstV1 was detected from 3 cloacal swab samples collected from chickens in poultry in Sri Lanka. avian influenza virus and coronaviruses have shown that migratory birds are able to carry viruses across widely disparate geographical locations. the discovery of diverse astroviruses in wild birds enabled us to deduce the evolutionary relationships of astroviruses in poultry, and in avian hosts as a whole, more precisely. group 3 avian astroviruses appear to show a more stringent species specificity. this new group of viruses was not detected in poultry by this or previous surveillance studies. astroviruses in wild doves and pigeons are phylogenetically closely related. more than 20 novel viruses were discovered in this study. future surveillance for avian astroviruses in wild birds will very likely elucidate further the diversity of avastroviruses."}
