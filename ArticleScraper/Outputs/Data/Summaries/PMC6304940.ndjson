{"summary": "we first examined CK1 in RV-infected cells using immunofluorescence (IF) confocal microscopy. we observed increased expression of CK1 in RV-infected cells compared with adjacent uninfected cells. CK1 expression is required for RV replication. CK1 is required for vNSP2 association with NSP5 and Viroplasm Assembly. silencing CK1 had little effect on the dispersed pattern of dNSP2 compared with cells transfected with an irrelevant siRNA. CK1 is critical for viroplasm formation, specifically for characteristic vNSP2 assembly and its association with NSP5. this disruption in viroplasm assembly provides an explanation for why CK1 is required for RV replication. viroplasmic localization of NSP2 and association with NSP5 is disrupted in CK1-silenced cells. silencing CK1 reduces vNSP2 and Prevents NSP5 hyperphosphorylation. previous in vitro reports showed that NSP5 hyperphosphorylation is CK1 and NSP2 dependent (23\u201325). dNSP2 interacts with only hypophosphorylated NSP5 and vNSP2 interacts with only hyperphosphorylated NSP5 (16). CK1 is clearly required for the appearance of the 28-kDa isoform of NSP5. phosphorylation may also require vNSP2 which is significantly reduced in CK1-silenced cells. vNSP2 could play a direct role in NSP5 phosphorylation. unmodified rNSP2 primarily migrates as a major protein band at 35 kDa in reducing conditions in SDS/PAGE gels. when incubated with [32P]ATP, rNSP2 was detected by autoradiography correlating with the addition of radiolabeled -phosphate to the protein. results confirm that NSP2 does autophosphorylate and showed that CK1 can directly phosphorylate NSP2. rNSP2 autophosphorylates and is phosphorylated by CK1. rNSP2 was separated in reducing gels and detected by CK1. phosphorylation of rNSP2 appears to have dual-specificity autokinase activity. phosphorylated amino acids are a serine/threonine kinase as well as tyrosine kinase. many of the identified phosphorylated residues are surface exposed. some near the active site could result from cis autophosphorylation. sh-NSP2 crystal structure shows a disulfide linkage between C8 and C85. the side chain of C8 acquires an alternative conformation to form a disulfide bridge with C85. the nitrogen (blue), oxygen (red) and sulfur (yellow) elements of C8 and C85 have been colored separately. CK1 phosphorylates NSP2 on CK1 after incubation with CK1. CK1 phosphorylates NSP2 on CK1 after incubation with CK1. CK1 phosphorylation was determined using rNSP2 double mutants. phosphorylated S313 resides within the C-terminal helix domain of NSP2. it is predicted to form interoctamer chains through domain swapping with the CTH on neighboring NSP2 octamers (17). we wanted to assess the contribution that a phosphorylated S313 might provide to the formation of NSP2 octamer chains. the black box outlines the magnified view of the four interoctamer interactions formed between R287 and D313. modeled phosphorylated S313 can engage in two hydrogen bond interactions with R287. CK1 expression is required for RV replication. viroplasms are detected using antibodies to vNSP2 (red) and NSP5 (purple) cell nuclei are stained with DAPI (blue) images to verify that the secondary antibody used to detect CK1 does not cross-react with anti-vNSP2 or anti-NSP5 primary antibodies are shown in SI Appendix, Fig. S1. silencing CK1 had little effect on dispersed pattern of dNSP2 compared with cells transfected with an irrelevant siRNA. some areas of increased dNSP2 density were noted, as well as a decrease in signal from NSP5. vNSP2 exhibited an uncharacteristic dispersed-like phenotype, reminiscent of dNSP2 and also appeared in large, asymmetric structures. NSP2 was detected with either anti-dNSP2 (nonreducing gel) or anti-vNSP2 (nonreducing gel) antibodies. the CK1-silenced lysate was run on the same gel as the controls. vNSP2, unlike dNSP2, can be detected only in RV-infected cell lysates prepared and separated on SDS/PAGE gels. all WBs to detect NSP2 in RV-infected cell lysates are performed under nonreducing conditions. phosphosite.org identified several amino acids in NSP2 that are potential targets for CK1 phosphorylation, including a serine, S313, that we previously found phosphorylated on NSP2 immunoprecipitated from RV-infected cell lysates. to test this possibility directly, we developed an in vitro phosphorylation assay. tidine at position 225 changed to alanine (NSP2 H225A) that is unable to hydrolyze ATP. the mutant was not able to autophosphorylate, but CK1 phosphorylation was unimpaired. this result confirmed that NSP2 autophosphorylation is dependent on NSP2 NTPase activity. mass spectrometry analysis of autophosphorylated rNSP2 from the in vitro phosphorylation assay showed 22 phosphorylated amino acids with high confidence values. rNSP2 appears to have dual-specificity autokinase activity, acting as both a serine/threonine kinase as well as a tyrosine kinase. ATP radioisotope buffer alone to freshly purified rNSP2 catalyzes the formation of four NSP2 protein bands. to determine if NSP2 forms disulfide bonds in RV-infected cells, we prevented the oxidation of free cysteines. this produced a single band of NSP2, demonstrating that NSP2 can form multiple disulfide linkages. the side chain of C8 adopts a conformation that forms a disulfide bridge (yellow) with C85. nitrogen (blue), oxygen (red) and sulfur (yellow) elements of C8 and C85 have been colored separately. CK1 Phosphorylates NSP2 on Serine 313. CK1 phosphorylates NSP2 on S313 with anti-dNSP2 monoclonal antibody. blot exposed to autoradiography film overnight to detect transfer of radiolabeled phosphate to NSP2. phosphorylation-deficient H225A single mutant was used as a positive control. the phosphate group can interact with the positively charged side chain of R287. phosphorylation of S313 leads to additional octamer\u2013octamer interactions. phosphorylation of S313 leads to additional octamer interactions. viroplasm assembly requires phosphorylation of RV nonstructural protein NSP2 by the cellular protein kinase CK1. CK1 facilitates interoctameric interactions not achieved by unmodified S313. viroplasm formation also requires the interaction of NSP2 with NSP5. vNSP2 is likely to have a role in NSP5 hyperphosphorylation. however, further studies are required to determine the role of vNSP2 in NSP5 hyperphosphorylation. CK1 phosphorylation of NSP2 S313 could induce conformational changes in the protein, exposing previously inaccessible residues for autophosphorylation. this is supported by the data (Fig. 5) showing no addition of 32P to the S313A or S313D mutants in presence of CK1. viroplasms have been shown to form on lipid droplets (32) conformational changes in NSP2 or NSP5 may expose lipophilic residues that allow the proteins to interact with cellular lipids bound for LDs. RV NSP5 possesses an amphipathic helix which theoretically could bind to LD membranes. kDa isoforms by CK1 and/or NSP2 to remain associated with vNSP2. phosphorylation is a common biological mechanism to turn enzymes on and off. kinases are often regulated by phosphorylation, which is a common biological mechanism to turn enzymes on and off. CK1-phosphorylated dNSP2 traffics to, or assembles at, viroplasm assembly sites. dNSP2 protein is hyperphosphorylated by CK1 during replication. CK1 also phosphorylates the RNA-binding nucleocapsid of coronavirus avian infectious bronchitis. our data suggest a phosphorylation-dependent mechanism for the formation of RV viroplasms. this suggests common mechanisms may exist for assembling the virus replication factories from other RNA viruses. cellular kinases are attractive targets for therapeutic intervention (38, 51) RV primary polyclonal antibody serum (1:1,500 in PBS) for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C. plates were washed three times with PBS and incubated with donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to fluorophore 488 (1:1,000 in PBS; Sigma) RV antibodies and commercially available polyclonal immunogen-purified rabbit anti-CK1 antibodies (1:200; Abcam), and mouse anti-tubulin (1:1,500; Sigma) were diluted in a 20% solution of SuperBlock Blocking Buffer. secondary antibodies goat anti-mouse, goat anti-guinea pig, and goat anti-rabbit conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (1:3,000; Sigma) were diluted in 20% SuperBlock.
