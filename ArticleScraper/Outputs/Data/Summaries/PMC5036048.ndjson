{"summary": "a solvent exposed hydrophobic pocket is located around the N-terminus of NHR. it cannot be covered by canonical CHRs or CHR-derived peptides. the NTHP is majorly composed of four hydrophobic residues, including leu544 and Ile548 from one NHR helix. the original CP peptide has low inhibitory activities against HIV-1 clinical strains, 92TH009 (subtype A/E, R5) and 92UG024 (subtype D, X4), with IC50 of 281.25 nM and 207.79 nM, respectively. CP-IDL showed the highest potency with increase of 109- and 55-fold for 92TH009 and 92UG024, respectively.

Table 2. Inhibitory activities of CP, CP-IDL and T20 against T2635 or T20 resistant strains. the helix, isoleucine and aspartic acid residues of IDL are located at the outer side. the residue participates in hydrophobic interactions with Ile548 and Val549. the interface area between one CP-IDL and trimeric NHR is 10981218 2, where IDL tails contribute 66124 2 (approximately 10%) CP in split pea and IDL in magentas extend region of N43 in cyan. IDL was designed to target N-terminal hydrophobic pocket (NTHP) but N36 (Ser546Leu581) trimer does not contain intact NTHP target. IDL hook-like tail contributes 158165 2 (approximately 13.914.4%) in the structure of N36-L6-CP-IDL. compared to the helical form, the hook-like IDL exhibited more extensive interactions with NHR. both structures contain 6 chains of fusion peptides within one asymmetric unit. molecular dynamics simulations of CP-IDL peptides were performed on two 6-HB models from the crystal structures of N36- and N43-L6-CP-IDL. the positions of 6 C-terminal residues were assessed by calculating the variance of their distances to the NHR within the same fusion peptide (average C-C distance) MD simulations indicated that the IDL tail in a separated CP-IDL peptide tend to bear a disordered conformation, which will be altered to a stable helical or hook-like structure when binding to short or long NHR helices. NTHP is majorly composed of four hydrophobic residues, including leu544 and Ile548 from one NHR helix, and leu545 and Val549 from an adjacent NHR helix. the previously undescribed pocket could be a potential target for enhancing the inhibitory potency of CP peptide. CP-IDL showed the highest potency with increase of 109- and 55-fold for 92TH009 and 92UG024 respectively. the enhanced activities of CP-IDL were stronger than that of T20 by 24- and 12-fold for the two strains. we compared the inhibitory activities of CP, CP-IDL and T20 against more HIV-1 isolates, including tire1, 2 and 3 viruses. animal 2 42.29 2.9 5.79 1.1 28.79 2.4 CRF02_AG/A1 clone 280 AG/A1 R5 Tier 2 213.3 14 5.62 1.2 28.39 3.2 CRF02_AG clone 278 AG R5 Tier 3 44.39 13 8.59 2.4 78.79 11 CRF02_AG clone 33 AG R5 Tier 3 111.2 4.8 2.82 0.5 45.73 1.6 BG505.W6 fusion peptide N36-L6-CP-IDL folds into a continuous -helix. CP-IDL tails contribute 66124 2 (approximately 10%) crystal structure of N36-L6-CP-IDL, N36-L6-CP-IDL and N43-L6-CP-IDL is shown in both side view and cross-section view. CP-IDL is colored in grey, C34 in blue and CP in forest and IDL in violet. isoleucine and leucine residues in IDL tail are toward the NHR trimer. the hydrophilic aspartic acid residue in IDL tail also forms an interaction with NHR by contributing its side chain oxygen atom to form a salt bridge. both the structures of N36- and N43-L6-CP-IDL contain 6 chains of fusion peptides within one asymmetric unit, forming two 6-HBs. for each structure, the 6 chains are generally identical (r.m.s. deviations of 0.380.88 and 0.120.30 for N36- and N43-L6-CP-IDL, respectively, table S1) the positions of 6 C-terminal residues were assessed by calculating the variance of their distances to the NHR within the same fusion peptide (average C-C distance) the interface area between a hook-like IDL tail and an NHR trimer was roughly stable in the range of 150300 2, contributing 1225% of the interface between CP-IDL and NHR. the 6HB fusion core is a critical target of anti-HIV fusion inhibitors. a hook-like structure formed by two native N-terminal CHR residues could increase the antiviral activity of both modified and unmodified inhibitors15,20. we are showing a novel case of rationally designed non-helical C-terminal IDL tail. it is capable to effectively enhance the potency of anti-HIV-1 fusion inhibitors. we crystallized two distinguished conformations, a one-turn helix and a hook-like structure. the structure with hook-like structure is more likely to represent the natural conformation of CP-IDL:NHR complexes in solution. the hook-like tail is conformationally similar to the previously disordered tail. it has been more than a decade since T20 was proved by u.s. FDA as an anti-HIV agent in the combination therapy of AIDS23,24. however, its shortcomings have limited its clinical application, including the lower anti-HIV activity, shorter half-life, expensive synthetic cost. concentrations of the peptides were determined by UV absorbance and a theoretically calculated molar-extinction coefficient based on tryptophan and tyrosine residues. for inhibition of HIV-1 92TH009 (subtype A/E, R5) and 92UG024 (subtype D, X4) infection,100 TCID50 of the virus was added to 1 105/ml M7 cells. fusion protein N36-L6-CP-IDL or N43-L6-CP-IDL was crystallized at 16 \u00b0C using the hanging drop, vapor-diffusion method. the drops were set on a siliconized cover clip by equilibrating a mixture containing 1 l protein solution (25 mg/ml N36-L6-CP-IDL trimer in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and 150 mM NaC the phasing problem of all three structures was solved by the molecular replacement method using the HKL2000 program29. the final models were manually adjusted in COOT31 and refined with PHENIX.refine32. the space group of N43-L6-CP-IDL was first assigned as P63 with one peptide in one asymmetric unit. cRfree is equivalent to Rcryst, but calculated using randomly chosen 10% (N36-L6-CP-IDL) or 5% (N43-L6-CP-IDL) reflections as the test set. the protein models were solvated by a TIP3P water box with a 20- layer of water molecules at each direction and then ionized with sodium and chloride ions. each model was subjected to energy minimization of 50,000 steps, followed by restrained NPT equilibration of 5 ns with isobaric and isothermal conditions maintained at 1 atm and 350 K. the structure of N36-L6-CP-IDL and isolated CP-IDL peptide models were subjected to MD simulations in the same fashion as described above. inhibition of peptides on HIV-1 clinical strains Inhibition activities of peptides on infection by HIV-1 clinical strains were determined as previously described28. for inhibition of HIV-1 92TH009 (subtype A/E, R5) and 92UG024 (subtype D, X4) infection,100 TCID50 of the virus was added to 1 105/ml M7 cells. fusion protein N36-L6-CP-IDL or N43-L6-CP-IDL was crystallized at 16 \u00b0C using the hanging drop, vapor-diffusion method. the drops were set on a siliconized cover clip by equilibrating a mixture containing 1 l protein solution (25 mg/ml) and 1 l reservoir solution (1.4 M Sodium Potassium Phosphate pH 8.2) the phasing problem of all three structures was solved by the molecular replacement method using PHENIX.phaser30 as a search model. the final models were manually adjusted in COOT31 and refined with PHENIX.refine32. the space group of N43-L6-CP-IDL was first assigned as P63 with one peptide in one asymmetric unit. cRfree is equivalent to Rcryst, but calculated using randomly chosen 10% (N36-L6-CP-IDL) or 5% (N43-L6-CP-IDL) reflections as the test set. each model was solvated by a TIP3P water box with a 20- layer of water molecules at each direction and then ionized with sodium and chloride ions. production simulations were conducted on equilibrated models for proper duration (60115 ns), followed by restrained NPT equilibration of 5 ns. the structure of N36-L6-CP-IDL and isolated CP-IDL peptide models were subjected to MD simulations in the same fashion as described above."}
