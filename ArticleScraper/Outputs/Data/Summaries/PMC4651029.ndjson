{"summary": "cell walls are robust layers that surround the cell membrane and are best known in plants, fungi, protists, algae, and bacteria. studies of brown algae and archeaplastida suggest that cell walls have evolved convergently (2). cell wall has a variety of functions from protection to the maintenance of cell shape. animal cells lack cell walls and are surrounded by a flexible lipid bilayer. these structures are responsible for molecule uptake and excretion, are involved in cell signaling, and maintain a stable osmotic pressure and pH (13). the cell walls found in plants, fungi, protists, algae, and bacteria provide a strong barrier for viral entry and exit not seen in animal cells. viruses from organisms possessing cell walls have evolved a variety of ways to ensure successful infection and spread. we selected 101 virus families from the 2013 release of the international committee on taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) (22). s\u201d contains all Eumycota, while animals were subdivided into \u201cVertebrates\u201d and \u201cInvertebrates\u201d (all non-Chordata) the remaining members of the animal clade were classified as \u201cProtozoa\u201d. this classification was developed only as a general guide for data analysis. the pattern of association between virus envelopes (presence or absence) and hosts (with and without cell wall) among 101 virus families. nonenveloped viruses are an adaptation to the evolution of the cell wall. cell entry pathways of the virus families analyzeda Cell entry pathway Virus family [reference(s]b Endocytosis Caliciviridae

single virus can induce several endocytosis pathways as observed for dengue virus and HIV-1. a single virus can induce several endocytosis pathways. plants and fungi are obligate intracellular parasites in that they remain with their host indefinitely but can be transmitted by vectors, fungi (42), mechanical injuries, or vertically (16). in plants and fungi, viruses do not actively breach the cell wall. calcified shell may have cell wall-degrading enzymes. most bacteriophage follow a three-step program to penetrate the cell wall. most bacteriophage use lytic enzymes to penetrate the cell wall. enveloped bacteriophage found in the Cystoviridae and Corticoviridae families fuse their envelope with the outer membrane of their hosts. both phages form a tube for DNA delivery which is initiated by capping vertices from the capsid. both phages form a tube for DNA delivery which is initiated by capping vertices from the capsid. different entry mechanisms are shown for nonenveloped (Head-Tail, Corticovirus, and Tectivirus), enveloped (Cystovirus), and filamentous (Enterobacteria phage M13) bacteriophage. structures are not drawn to scale, and only key structures for viral entry are shown. the presence of the cell wall requires cell wall-degrading enzymes for successful infection. the presence or absence of a viral envelope is clearly better associated with cell structure, especially the presence or absence of a cell wall, than to a specific type of host species. noncirculative transmission is essential for viruses that remain within the vector at the mouthparts or foregut. in contrast, circulative transmission allows longer times between acquisition and transmission of the virus into the new host. transport across the plasmodesmata requires a virus-encoded movement protein which interacts with the plasmodesmata to allow the passage of the virus particles. enveloped virions are found in the perinuclear space and at the cell membrane (74) the enveloped form of plant viruses is not transported to neighboring cells. this scenario has also been reported for tospovirus, the only genus of the Bunyaviridae infecting plants. envelopes are needed only upon vector-aided translocation due to the fact that viral transport is possible as capsid, RNP, or naked DNA/RNA, such that the viral envelope is not required. only a few enveloped viruses lyse the host cell to be released, while virtually all nonenveloped viruses exit the host cell through lysis. virus envelopes can be targeted by holins without being permeabilized themselves. the envelope is acquired from the inner membrane of the host. this would release capsids capable of digesting cell walls. a single virus can induce several endocytosis pathways as observed for dengue virus and HIV-1. additional entry pathways for dengue via the clathrin-mediated pathway (34) and HIV-1 through fusion have been observed. such entry pathways are blocked in plants and bacteria due to presence of the cell wall. hyphal anastomosis (fusion of encountering vegetative hyphae) allows fungal viruses to stay in the host. some plant viruses remain asymptomatic inside the host. algae share similarities with plants with respect to cell architecture. all known bacteriophage use lytic enzymes to penetrate the cell wall. different mechanisms have been described to overcome the bacterial membranes. enveloped bacteriophage, such as X174, form a tube to deliver their genome into the host. cytosol pushes the internal membrane through a special vertex in the capsid. the emerging membrane has lytic properties and digests the cell wall. PRD1 possess proteins that are loosely associated with the internal membrane. however, as Bam35 infects Gram-positive bacteria, it does not need to perforate an outer membrane. no Gram-positive hosts are known for corticovirus and cystovirus. a red X indicates possible interference of the cell wall onto the entry mechanism. another bacteriophage family has evolved a very different approach. plant viruses move from cell to cell by plasmodesmata and across whole vascular plants by phloem (62) multicellular fungi are coenocytic (large cells with several nuclei) or the cells are separated by septa, i.e., end walls that can be perforated and therefore connect neighboring hyphae. the movement of viral capsids within or between fungi is not restricted and can occur horizontally by hyphal anas the transport of viruses within plants occurs either as a viral capsid (67, 68) but not as enveloped viruses. only four plant-infecting virus genera possess an envelope: Cytorhabdovirus, Nucleorhabdovirus, Emaravirus, and Tospovirus. two transmembrane glycoproteins GN and GC are required for vector transmission. targeted point mutations in GN and GC inhibited transmission through thrips. toposvirus is associated only with thrips (18, 80) inoviridae encode three proteins that create a secretion channel through the cell wall and bacterial membranes. holins and pinholins, small viral membrane proteins, are secreted into the inner membrane of the host. the subsequent release of endolysins into the periplasm degrades the peptidoglycan. the release pathway of the enveloped bacteriophage Cystovirus is currently unclear. a strong relationship between enveloped viruses and animal host cells and nonenveloped viruses and host cells with cell walls. the lack of a cell wall provides an adaptive advantage to viruses with envelopes. a variety of models can be proposed to explain evolution of the viral envelope. a large number of new RNA viruses have recently been identified in arthropods. a pivotal position of arthropods between plants and vertebrates could have facilitated the adaptation of nonenveloped viruses to vertebrates. the only enveloped viruses in plants are Emaravirus, Bunyavirus, and Rhabdovirus. fusion or budding from a plant or fungal cell is not feasible due to the presence of a cell wall. early bacteriophage viruses were very likely nonenveloped. a scenario of coexisting nonenveloped and enveloped early viruses is unlikely. nonenveloped bacteriophage show the simplest adaptation for bacterial infection. enveloped bacteriophage need to deal with the lytic pathway and limited entry possibilities. without a cell wall, endocytosis of enveloped and nonenveloped viruses would most likely occur. capsids (in the absence of envelopes) offer less visibility to the immune system. innate immunity recognizes pathogens in a generic way. innate immunity recognizes pathogens in a generic way. the envelope may serve as a decoy, as the virus appears to be a host cell. the cell wall provides a physical barrier that hinders the interaction of receptors on the viral envelope with receptors in the cell membrane. the viral envelope has evolved several times independently, reflecting the diversity of hosts encountered. a large number of new RNA viruses have recently been identified in arthropods. animal cells show less discrimination between enveloped and nonenveloped viruses than organisms that possess a cell wall. the only enveloped viruses in plants are Emaravirus, Bunyavirus, and Rhabdovirus. most plant and fungal viruses are not enveloped due to presence of a cell wall. adaptation of viral capsids or RNPs for transport by plasmodesmata means early plant viruses were nonenveloped. bacteriophage encode their own membrane proteins but gain lipids from their hosts. nonenveloped bacteriophage show the simplest adaptation for bacterial infection. enveloped bacteriophage need to deal with the lytic pathway and limited entry possibilities. without a cell wall, endocytosis of enveloped and nonenveloped viruses would most likely occur. capsids have the ability to trigger more than one endocytosis pathway. innate immunity recognizes pathogens in a generic way. innate immunity recognizes pathogens in a generic way. the envelope may serve as a decoy, as the virus appears to be a host cell. the cell wall provides a physical barrier that hinders the interaction of receptors on the viral envelope with receptors in the cell membrane. this is a new perspective on our understanding of virus origins and evolution. the average density of a protein of 60 kDa can be calculated as described previously. the average density of a protein of 60 kDa can be calculated as described previously (100, 101), resulting in 1.4114 g/cm3. assuming a sphere with volume V, the diameter (d) is calculated as follows: d ( nm ) = 2 ( 3 V / 4 1 / 3 ) (7) d ( nm ) = 2 [ 3 70.579 ( nm 3 ) / 4 1 / 3 ] (8) d = 2.563 nm (9) Supplementary material supp_79_4_403__index.html (921B, html)"}
