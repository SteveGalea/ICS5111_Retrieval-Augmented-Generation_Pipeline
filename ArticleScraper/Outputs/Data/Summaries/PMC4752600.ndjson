{"summary": "the overexpression of the SARS-CoV M gene has been shown to upregulate the transcriptional level of IFN- (26) the result of a dual-luciferase assay using the Renilla luciferase gene as a transfection control demonstrated that the SARS-CoV M gene rather than the S and E genes markedly increased IFN- promoter activity. pCMV-Myc-M was cotransfected with pNFB-luc, which contained five copies of NF-B recognition sites, into HEK293T cells. results of the dual-luciferase assay revealed that the SARS-CoV M gene specifically and dramatically upregulated NF-B activity compared with the controls. HEK293T cells were individually transfected with pCMV-Myc, pEGFP, pCMV-Myc-M, pCMV-Myc-M plus pBS-U6-siM1 and poly(I:C) after 48 h of transfection, total RNAs were isolated from each transfection. pCMV-Myc-M(V68A), pCMV-Myc-E, pCMV-Myc-S, and poly(I:C) were transiently transfected into HEK293T cells. whole-cell lysates were harvested and subjected to Western blotting by using specific antibodies (Ab) as indicated. dual-luciferase assay performed 48 h of transfection to detect IFN- expression. each value represents the mean standard deviation from three independent tests. individually diminishing either TBK1 or IRF3 mRNA expression by siTBK1 or siIRF3 significantly reversed M-mediated IFN- induction. increased doses of pCMV-Myc-M plasmid DNAs were transfected into HEK293ET cells grown on 35-mm2 culture dishes. total RNAs or whole-cell lysates were isolated or harvested at 48 h posttransfection. one-step RT-PCR (RT) was conducted to detect the TBK1 mRNA expression with specific primers. Western blotting was performed to detect TBK1 protein expression using specific anti-TBK1 antibody. -siIRF3 plasmid DNAs were transiently transfected into HEK293T cells. total RNAs or whole-cell lysates were isolated or harvested at 48 h posttransfection. Western blotting was performed to detect IRF3 protein expression. each value represents the mean standard deviation from three independent tests. both RLR and TLR pathways transmit the signal to a common class of adaptors called tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) pCMV-Myc-M constructs was first transiently transfected into HEK293ET cells. the results in Fig. 3A demonstrate that the increased delivery of pCMV-Myc-M into HEK293ET cells markedly enhanced TRAF6 but not TRAF2 and TRAF3 expression. LR signaling pathways in HEK293ET cells was assayed by Western blot analysis. effect of M gene product on expression of TRAF signaling molecules. reaction products were probed with anti-TRAF2, anti-TRAF3 and anti-TRAF6. expression of -actin served as an internal control. the SARS-CoV M gene product promotes IFN- production through toll-like-receptor-related signaling pathways in immortalized murine bone marrow-derived macrophage cells. the pCMV-Myc-M construct was transiently transfected into J2-M cells, an immortalized murine bone marrow-derived macrophage cell line established with J2 virus (30, 31) the delivery of the M gene product is effective in stimulating the activation of both IFN about 100 ng of pGL3-IFN-luc reporter was cotransfected with 2 g of pCMV-Myc or pCMV-Myc-M plus 10 ng of pRL-TK into J2-M cells. the dual-luciferase assay was conducted to assay the relative expression of the NF-B promoter. each value represents the mean standard deviation from three independent tests. the increased doses of pCMV-Myc-M plasmid DNAs were transfected into J2-M cells. cell lysates were harvested 48 h posttransfection. the reaction products were probed with antibodies to p-IRF3 and IRF3, p-NF-B p65 and NF-B p65, and p-TBK and TBK1. the expression of -actin served as an internal control. the relative band intensity was quantitated with the Image J program. the results in panels D to G are representative of at least 2 identical experiments. pCMV-Myc, pCMV-Myc-M, or pCMV-Myc-M-stop were transiently transfected into HEK293T cells. at 48 h posttransfection, cell lysates were prepared. the reaction products were probed with anti-Myc antibody. expression of -actin served as an internal control. doses (0, 5, 20, and 100 g/ml) of cycloheximide (CHX) were added to the culture medium. both total RNAs and cell lysates were harvested from the same transfection. RT-PCR was conducted to detect expression levels of IFN-, M gene, and -actin. either M or M-stop constructs were cotransfected with IFN- luciferase reporter into HEK293T cells. the chemical inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) was used to block the protein biosynthesis in transfected HEK293T cells. this indicates that protein translation is necessary for M-induced IFN- production. brefeldin A (BFA) was employed in the assay system to block M protein transport from the rough endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface. addition of BFA effectively inhibited the secretion of IFN- into the cell culture medium. RT-PCR analysis was conducted to measure mRNA expression of the IFN- gene in the absence or presence of BFA. mRNA expression of the M gene and the loading control of the -actin gene were also analyzed. western blotting was performed to detect the protein expression of IFN- in the absence or presence of OxPAPC. hek293T cells were transfected with 100 ng of pGL3-IFN-luc plus 10 ng of pRL-TK in the absence or presence of 1 g CD14 plus 1 g MD2 plasmids. SARS-CoV M protein promotes IFN- induction independently of TRAF3. it has been well known that TRAF3 plays a critical role in TLR-mediated IFN- induction. to address this issue directly, a specific siRNA against TRAF3 was successfully constructed. pSilencer-siTRAF3 plasmid DNAs were transiently transfected into HEK293T cells. total RNAs were isolated at 48 h posttransfection. effect of siTRAF3 on M-mediated IFN- induction was evaluated. cell lysates were harvested 48 h posttransfection. reaction products were probed with antibodies to p-TBK1, p-IRF3, p-NF-B p65, and IFN-. expression of -actin served as a loading control. pCMV-Myc-M or pCMV-Myc was cotransfected with TBK1-Flag and TRAF3-HA. cells were harvested 48 h posttransfection. co-IP was conducted as shown in the left panel. the statistical difference was considered to be significant at a P value of 0.05. the relative band intensity was quantitated with the Image J program in comparison with the -actin control. M mutant [M(V68A)] fails to activate IFN- production in infected cells. it has been shown that codelivering the M, N, and S genes of SARS-CoV into HEK293 cells readily produced SARS-CoV pseudovirus with the corona-like halo (35). RT-PCR was used to detect the mRNA expression of ACE2 in the HEK293, HEK293T, and HEK293-ACE2 stable cell line. results are representative of at least 2 identical experiments. 293T cell line was transformed with simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen. HEK293ET cell line was transformed with both SV40 large T antigen and EBNA1 antigen. cells were a gift from Genhong Cheng and were cultured in RPMI 1640. both pEF-BOS-TBK1 and pCDNA-HA-TRAF3 were from Addgene (Cambridge, MA, USA) both pEF-BOS-TBK1 and pCDNA-HA-TRAF3 were from Addgene (Cambridge, MA, USA) oligonucleotides 5\u2032 GATCCGCGAGAACTCCTCTCTCGAGGGAGAGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG the reaction product was evenly distributed onto the cell culture surface of either 6-well plates or 35-mm2 dishes. after a 24-h transfection, the cell culture medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 1,200 g/ml G418. Western blot analysis was performed to detect TRAF3 expression. real-time qRT-PCR was carried out with the CFX real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) the dissociation of the reaction products was conducted from 55\u00b0C to 95\u00b0C as the temperature rose at 0.2\u00b0C per 10 s. the transfected cells were lysed with a lysis buffer containing 1% NP-40, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 120 mM NaCl, 200 M NaVO4, 1 g/ml leupeptin, 1 g/ml aprotinin, and 1 M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) about 15 g of cell lysate for each sample was resolved by firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were read with a Modulus microplate multimode reader. the transfected cells were lysed with a lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.2% Triton, 1 g/ml leupeptin, 1 g/ml aprotinin, and 1 mM PM 293 cells were cotransfected with either the S, M, and N genes or the S, M mutant M(V68A) and N of SARS-CoV. the reaction products were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. the supernatant containing VLPs was then applied to HEK293-ACE2 stable cells and incubated for 4 h. after 24 h, the cells were subjected to total RNA isolation. all values were calculated as means standard deviations (SDs) from three independent experiments. calculated difference was considered significant at the P value of 0.05."}
