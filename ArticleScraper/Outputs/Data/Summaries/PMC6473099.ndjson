{"summary": "influenza A and B viruses cause 500,000 annual deaths worldwide. the majority of severe human infections are caused by IAV. IVs have segmented negative-sense single-stranded RNA genomes. in otherwise healthy individuals, IAV infections are mild and the ensuing pro- and anti-inflammatory responses are balanced. a cytokine storm is typically associated with severe infections including those caused by highly pathogenic IV strains. acute lung injury (ALI) caused by this inflammatory response is typically characterized by significant damage or destruction of the respiratory epithelium leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) mouse-adapted laboratory IAV (H1N1) (16) C5a IFX-1 antibody \u2013 Reduced viral load and virus-induced ALI due to reduced infiltration of lung macrophages and neutrophils in IAV-infected African green monkeys. 2009 pandemic IAV (H1N1) (28) MEK CI-1040 \u2013 Reduced lung viral load and mortality of IAV-infected mice. similar effect when administered 48\u201372 h after infection. the effectiveness of these HA-stem Abs against a broad range of IAV subtypes is overshadowed by Abs targeting the viral HA-stem. MHAA4549A, MEDI8852, and VIS410 are human monoclonal Abs that have been shown to control viral replication. NETs released during IAV-induced pneumonia caused alveolar damage. complement protein C5a was shown to induce NETs release and administration of anti-C5a Abs (IFX-1) reduced H7N9-induced ALI due to reduced infiltration of lung macrophages and neutrophils. LL-37 is a human cathelicidin derived AMP that is found predominantly in neutrophils. its expression can also be induced in epithelial cells and macrophages. both cellular and viral IL-1-converting enzyme-inhibitory protein protect cells from death receptor mediated apoptosis. c-Jun N-terminal kinases 1 and 2 (JNK1/JNK2) regulate pro-inflammatory responses. in vivo inhibition of JNK1/JNK2 resulted in reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduced viral titers. SC75741 is a potent NFkB inhibitor that functions by reducing the ability of the p65 subunit of the NFkB complex to bind DNA. in vitro inhibition of SphK1 was shown to decrease IAV RNA synthesis via suppression of NFkB activation. specific inhibitors to either SphK1 or SphK2 or a pan-SphK inhibitor led to prolonged survival of mice following lethal IAV infection (29). PPAR, PPAR, and PPAR regulate metabolic homeostasis and are important mediators of the inflammatory response. the association was contested in two additional studies that found no benefit of statin treatment on IAV-induced disease burden. however, this uncertainty regarding the therapeutic potential of these widely used compounds warrant further investigations at the basic science level and in clinical trials.

LL-37 is a human cathelicidin derived AMP that is found predominantly in neutrophils. its expression can also be induced in epithelial cells and macrophages. both cellular and viral IL-1-converting enzyme-inhibitory protein protect cells from death receptor mediated apoptosis. IAV infection has been shown to upregulate c-Jun N-terminal kinases 1 and 2 (JNK1/JNK2) these kinases directly regulate pro-inflammatory responses. in vivo inhibition of JNK1/JNK2 resulted in reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduced viral titers. SC75741 is a potent NFkB inhibitor that functions by reducing the ability of the p65 subunit of the NFkB complex to bind DNA. in vivo administration of SC75741 at 4 days after lethal infection resulted in significant protection with most mice showing little to no clinical symptoms. treatment of mice with specific inhibitors to either SphK1 or SphK2 or a pan-SphK inhibitor led to prolonged survival of mice following lethal IAV infection. treatment of mice with specific inhibitors to either SphK1 or SphK2 or a pan-SphK inhibitor led to prolonged survival of mice following lethal IAV infection. UK and USA reported an association of reduced IAV-related pneumonia and lower case fatality due to lower respiratory tract IAV infections with statin treatment. however, this association was contested in two additional studies that found no benefit of statin treatment on IAV-induced disease burden (78, 79). this uncertainty regarding the therapeutic potential of these widely used compounds warrant further investigations at the basic science level and in clinical trials. TRAIL regulates immune cell-mediated apoptosis of infected cells. blocking TRAIL signaling by genomic deletion or depletion by monoclonal antibody administration can improve infection outcome in mice. inhibition of TRAIL signaling in alveolar macrophages and other monocytes can improve infection outcome in mice. in vivo models will increase the likelihood of identifying BRMs with clinically relevant antiviral and immunomodulatory potentials. authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
