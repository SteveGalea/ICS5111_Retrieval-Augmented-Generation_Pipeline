{"summary": "botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) is the strongest organic poison for humans and animals. it is produced by the anaerobic, Gram-positive, spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium Clostridium botulinum. the estimated human lethal dose is about 10 nanograms per kilogram of bodyweight if the toxin is inhaled and one microgram if it is taken orally. monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to BoNT can be prduced in vitro. sdAbs recognize the antigen with only one special variable domain, referred to as VHH. the structure of the HC-Abs resembles the VH IgG domain. the antigen-binding region of VHHs produced by camelids showed strong anti-BoNT activities in animal models. sdAbs are currently in clinical phase trials for the treatment of a wide range of diseases, including cancer, inflammation, hematology, and respiratory diseases. in vitro studies and stem cell transplantation research has demonstrated that the half-life of these VHHs could be extended to several weeks with retained functionality. fusionbodies increase the total protein complex size, as well as VHH-Fc interaction with neonatal Fc-receptor (FcRn), making it impossible to clear. botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT)/A was used as an antigen with Freund\u2019s complete adjuvant (FCA) and Freund\u2019s incomplete adjuvant (FIA) for alpaca immunization. polyclonal phage library titer for all rounds was approximately 1013 CFU (colony-forming unit)/mL. ELISA characterization of phages from different rounds of selection (1011 phages/well) binding to BoNT/A or BoNT/A-DTT (dithiothreitol) (100 ng/well) 0.2 and negligible reactivity with bovine serum albumin (BSA) were selected for sequencing. a total of 15 clones with different CDR3 amino acid sequences were selected for further research. the most protective clones, B11 and G3, were titrated in series down to 107 CFU and introduced intraperitoneally into mice simultaneously with 10 LD50 of the toxin. each group of mice was challenged with 5 LD50 of the toxin and administered 1011 CFU/mL phages. both clones failed to protect the mice. the polypeptide chain of the toxin bound specific antibodies was denatured by DTT into its HC and LC. anti-human IgG (Fc-specific)-peroxidase antibodies (1:2500) were used as detection reagents. a total of 500 ng of the toxin was used per well. BoNT/A-DTT preparations contained approximately 250 ng of the toxin. modified forms of VHHs, different amounts of monomers, dimers, and VHHs fused with Fc fragments were premixed with 5 LD50 BoNT/A. monomers had only partial protectiveness even at the highest amount, 100 g, with protectiveness gradually decreasing and failing at 10 g. monomers had only partial protectiveness even at the highest amount, 100 g, with protectiveness gradually decreasing and failing at 10 g. the appropriate amount of antibodies was mixed with 5 LD50 of BoNT/A for one hour. the final number of surviving mice was determined four days later. the concentrations of the molecules in the sera at indicated time points were measured by ELISA. mice who previously received 100\u201350 g of the VHH-Fc were partially protected (clone B11-Fc) or not (clone G3-Fc) after two weeks, 1 g of the preparation had no protectiveness. three hours after toxin challenge, the clones lacked protectiveness. clone B11-Fc increased the protective activity at least 100,000 times. clone B11-Fc increased the protective activity at least 100,000 times. the estimated molecular ratio of the 5 LD50 to 0.001 g pre-mix was 1:22. a library with a size of 5 106 phagemids was obtained. two rounds of selection were performed for acquiring phage libraries. the polyclonal phage library titer was approximately 1013 CFU. in vivo monoclonal phage neutralization assay was performed. mice were divided into groups and received one intraperitoneal injection with 10 LD50 or 50 LD50 BoNT/A after 1 h incubation with phage libraries. all mice in the positive control group survived, while all mice in the negative control group and the TeNT group died. each group received one intraperitoneal injection with 10 LD50 BoNT/A. only the four clones (B10, C10, B11, G3) that fully protected the mice against a 10 LD50 challenge were chosen to test their protectiveness with a 50 LD50 challenge. the most protective clones, B11 and G3, were titrated in series down to 107 CFU. the second construction was a monomer of each clone linked to a human IgG Fc fragment (B11-Fc and G3-Fc) the dimers were produced and purified from the bacterial periplasmic fraction and verified by SDS-PAGE to be 30 kDa. ize BoNT/A and BoNT/A-DTT on the sensor chip. the kinetic binding on- and off-rates between the antibodies and the toxin were determined from sensorgram analysis. in vivo protection analysis, modified forms of VHHs fused with Fc fragments were premixed with 5 LD50 BoNT/A and injected intraperitoneally into mice. monomers had only partial protectiveness even at the highest amount, 100 g. the dimers showed a better result on average, with full protectiveness of the B11-dimer at 100 g and partial protectiveness of the G3-dimer at 100\u201320 g amounts failing at 10 g. all forms of VHHs fused with Fc fragments could protect the mice even at the lowest amounts tested (0.1\u20130.001 g) ELISA was used to measure the concentrations of G3, B11, G3-dimer, B11-dimer, or B11-Fc in mouse blood taken at different time points after injection. the concentrations of B11-Fc and G3-Fc 96 h post-injection were only about 10% of the initial level observed at 0 h. two weeks after injection, the concentrations of B11-Fc antibodies were approximately 1% of the initial level. both clones fully protected the mice before and after toxin challenge. three hours after toxin challenge, the clones lacked protectiveness. discussed boNT is the most potent and lethal known toxin. HHs are a popular tool for constructing recombinant antibodies to detect and neutralize targets. the main differences of VHHs from conventional antibodies include specific conserved amino acid substitutions in framework region 2 (FR2) that make contact with the LC of classical antibodies, as well as a longer length, more variable amino acid composition in the CDR3s. all clones with neutralizing potency did not have the highest ELISA signals. the next step was to produce and purify VHHs in protein form to test their neutralizing potency in vivo. even when pre-mixing a 100 g dose with the toxin, they had a 50\u201375% protection efficiency. scFvs fused with Fc fragments (scFv-Fc) obtained from a macaque immune library were tested ex vivo. two chosen clones were dimerized via a (Gly4Ser)3 linker or fusion to human Fc fragments to stabilize the molecules and slow down their clearance. both clones fully protected the mice at doses as low as 0.1 g. both clones with Fc fragments showed at least a 1000-fold improvement in protectiveness compared to conventional VHHs and dimers. the ED50 dose for clone B11-Fc could not be determined, while it was 0.01 g for clone G3-Fc. the clone failed to protect the mice at 0.001 g. the toxin has provided a new method to screen for neutralizing VHHs. they increase the range of options for BoNT/A targeting and neutralization. they increase the range of options for BoNT/A targeting and neutralization. animals with characteristic symptoms of botulism were euthanized by cervical dislocation. antigen preparation BoNT/A from the C. botulinum strain A98 was obtained. small blood samples (5\u20137 mL) were collected before immunization. five days after the final injection, 50 mL blood sample was collected. mRNA isolation, PCR amplification, and library construction were performed. the bacteria from the VHH library were added to 2 YT medium (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and incubated at 37 \u00b0C in a culture shaker at 210 rpm to an OD600 = 0.6. the next day, the culture was centrifuged, the supernatant was purified and concentrated by 20% polyethylene glycol (PEG 8000), 2.5 M NaCl precipitation. a total of 1011 phages were added to each well and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. the bound phages were eluted by trypsin with a final concentration of 1 mg/mL. unbound phages were removed by washing 10 times with TPBS. the plate wells were detected by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-M13 antibodies (1:5000) followed by the addition of peroxidase substrate 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) the reaction was stopped by 1 M H2SO4, and the absorbance at 450 nm was read with an iEMS Reader MF. eluted fraction was subjected to dialysis with Visking dialysis tubing (MWCO 12000\u201314000) under denaturing conditions.
