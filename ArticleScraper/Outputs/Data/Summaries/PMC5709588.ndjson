CHIKV is an alphavirus transmitted by mosquitoes, mainly Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. ti and 96.7% in A. albopictus populations indicate a high risk of establishment and spread of CHIKV throughout tropical, subtropical, and even temperate regions of the Americas. early antiretroviral treatment, even when continued for >10 years, is unlikely to lead to virus eradication. onavirus (MERS-CoV) has caused more than 900 human infections with 40% mortality. animals are needed to study MERS-CoV pathogenesis and for the development of preventive and therapeutic agents. several entry factors, including DC-SIGN, AXL, and Tyro3, allowed ZIKV entry. further, ZIKV induced the transcription of toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), RIG-I, and MDA5."}
