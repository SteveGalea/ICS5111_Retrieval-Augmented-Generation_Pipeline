{"summary": "clinical characteristics of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) patients versus test-negative patients were compared by Pearson's 2, Fisher's Exact, and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. fourteen untreated patients returned, and 3 were hospitalized on oseltamivir (median ILI-score = 19) the severity of seasonal influenza epidemics is unpredictable and influenced by the predominant circulating virus strains and level of immunity in the population. re-emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) virus among poultry with sporadic transmission to exposed persons has stimulated global influenza pandemic preparedness [5]. clinicians from the Adult Infectious Diseases Unit used a modified ILI scoring system to systematically triage adult patients with respiratory complaints. the scoring system was adapted from a system developed by Hak et al in the united states for hospitalization decision-making among elderly patients with pneumonia or influenza during influenza epidemics. one aliquot was tested by rapid diagnostic test and immunofluorescence at the hospital. a second aliquot was sent frozen at 70\u00b0C to the national public health laboratory in Mexico City. each hospitalized patient had a chest x-ray and a chest CT scan performed at admission. patients' median age was 29 years [IQR 22\u201341 years] and 55% were female. 167 (9.1%) were classified at high risk (mean ILI-score = 19), 725 (39.4%) at intermediate risk (median ILI-score = 10), and 945 (51.4%) at low risk (median ILI-score = 3) of developing complications of presumptive 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) disease.
