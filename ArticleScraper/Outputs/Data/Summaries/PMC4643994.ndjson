{"summary": "low Clostridium leptum levels are a risk factor for the development of asthma. the impact of early-life C. leptum exposure on cesarean-delivered mice remains unclear. mice exposed to C. leptum + OVA did not develop typical asthma phenotype. IL-25 and IL-33 were recently recognized as playing a central role in immune deviation toward pathogenic Th2 responses during the evolution of T helper effector cells. Th17 cells are characterized by IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-21 production. these cytokines indirectly promote eosinophilic infiltration and airway macrophage survival. contact with maternal vaginal and intestinal flora is an important source for initiating bacterial colonization of the infant\u2019s gut. clostridia colonization is associated with CD [20], altering microbial stimuli that may influence immune system maturation and the development of antigenic tolerance. mice created an immunosuppressive environment that increased CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ Treg numbers. increased T effector cells, including Th1, Th2, Th9, and Th17 production and cytokine secretion in vivo. a single C. leptum colony was grown in chopped meat broth. esarean section was performed to obtain the pups in a SPF barrier environment. the pups were transferred to postpartum (24\u201348 h after vaginal delivery) female SPF mice served as foster mothers. the experimental protocols were established according to the national institutes of health animal research and care guidelines. mice were challenged with 1% aerosolized OVA or PBS for 20 min. mice underwent pulmonary function tests (PFT) and bronchoalveolar lavage. the mediastinal lymph nodes and lungs were collected for the experiments. the responder cells (2 105) were plated in 96-well U-bottom plates along with the Treg cells at ratios of 1:1, 1:0.5, 1:0.25, and 1:0.125, or without any Treg cells (positive control), and cultured for 72 h at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. ophycocyanin-conjugated anti-CD8, FITC-conjugated anti\u2013IFN-, IL-4, IL-9, and IL-22 intracellular staining was performed after 4-h stimulation with 25 ng/mL phorbol 2-myristate 13-acetate, 1 mg/mL ionomycin, and 2 nmol/mL monensin. total RNA was extracted from lung tissue using TRIzol reagent ( the results were analyzed using the comparative threshold cycle value (2-CT) method. the concentrations of secreted IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-9, IL-22, IL-21, IL-23, IL-17A, IL-17F, IFN-, IL-10, IL-25, and IL-33 in the supernatants of the co-cultures were determined. tissue sections (5 m) were fixed in 10% formalin overnight and paraffin-embedded. hematoxylin\u2013eosin scoring system was described previously. pregnant mice were killed by cervical dislocation on gestational day 20. the pups were transferred to postpartum (24\u201348 h after vaginal delivery) female SPF mice that served as foster mothers. experimental protocols were established according to the national institutes of health animal research and care guidelines. mice were challenged with 1% aerosolized OVA or PBS for 20 min. the mice underwent pulmonary function tests (PFT) and bronchoalveolar lavage. the mediastinal lymph nodes (MLN) and lungs were collected. 4+CD25+FOXP3+ cells were sorted into the CD4+CD25+ Treg subset and the CD4+CD25\u2013 responder T subset. the responder cells (2 105) were plated in 96-well U-bottom plates along with the Treg cells at ratios of 1:1, 1:0.5, 1:0.25, and 1:0.125, or without any Treg cells (positive control) FITC-conjugated anti-IFN-, IL-4, IL-9, IL-17A, and IL-22 intracellular staining was performed after 4-h stimulation with 25 ng/mL phorbol 2-myristate 13-acetate. total RNA was extracted from lung tissue using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) the amplification thermal cycling reaction consisted of 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 30 s, 58\u00b0C for 60 min, and 95\u00b0C for 5 min. the results were analyzed using the comparative threshold cycle value (2-CT) method. numbers in 200 cells per BALF sample were counted in a masked manner. the scoring system used has been described previously [30]: 0, no cells; 1, a few cells; 2, a ring of cells 1\u2013cell layer deep; 3, a ring of cells 2\u20134-cell layers deep. early-life fed-CL reduced airway responsiveness and cell numbers in CD asthmatic mice. we fed 8-day-old CD pups with C. leptum and established an asthma model after they had been weaned. pulmonary function 48 h after the final OVA challenge day. early-life fed-CL reduced airway responsiveness, BALF cell numbers, and inflammatory cell infiltration in CD asthma mice. early-life fed-CL induced Treg cells in the lungs of the C/-/OVA mice. RT-PCR investigation of the expression of the Treg-specific transcription factor FOXP3 in whole lung tissue revealed increased Foxp3 expression in both fed-CL groups relative to C/-/-. fresh CD4+CD25+ Treg cells and CD4+CD25\u2013 T cells were obtained from untreated mice. p 0.05 vs. C/-/-; p 0.05 vs. C/CL/-; *p 0.05 vs. fresh Treg cells. fed-CL has an immunosuppressive effect Th1, Th2, Th9, Th17, and Th22 lymphocytes are regularly associated with allergic asthma. the Th22 cytokine IL-22 in C/-/OVA mice was significantly decreased. there was no difference in IL-22 production in C/CL/OVA mice. IL-5, IL-13, IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, and IL-23 levels in C/CL/OVA mice were higher than that in C/-/- mice. fed-CL increased Treg cells in CD mice compared with VD weanling mice. the difference was not significant. the asthma model was established when the mice were 52 days old. oral feeding with C. leptum attenuates allergic airway resistance in asthmatic mice. total cell number, eosinophils, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages increased in the C/-/OVA group. Lung tissue sections stained with hematoxylin\u2013eosin to evaluate allergic inflammation. p 0.05 vs. C/-/-; p 0.05 vs. C/CL/-; & p 0.05 vs. C/-/OVA. early-life fed-CL induced Treg cells in CD asthma mice. inhibition of CD4+CD25+ Treg cells was strongest at a 1:1 ratio. analysis of the cytokine content of the cell-free BALF revealed significantly decreased Treg cytokines (IL-10, TGF-1) in C/-/OVA mice as compared with the control C/-/- mice. Th1, Th2, Th9, and Th17 levels were significantly higher in C/CL/OVA mice compared with C/-/- and C/CL/- mice. cytokines of Th1 (IFN-), Th2 (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13), Th9 (IL-9), and Th17 (IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, IL-23) were all significantly increased in C/CL/OVA mice as compared with C/-/- IL-25 and IL-33 were statistically increased in both C/-/OVA and C/CL/OVA mice as compared with the C/-/- mice. early-life fed-CL had an immunosuppressive effect. ELISA determination of (B) Th1, (C) Th2, (D) Th9, (E) Th17, (F) Th22 cytokines. children born by caesarian section have significantly increased asthma risk when they are 36 months old. the commensal microbiota is abundant in the intestinal tract, but are significantly decreased in germ-free animals. a mixture of clostridial species appears to drive their development. eosinophils, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages in the BALF of OVA-sensitized mice. increased eosinophil numbers in the BALF and airway tissue inflammatory infiltrates is a characteristic of asthma. enhancing Treg function is attractive potential therapy for treating allergic asthma. early-life fed-CL increased Treg numbers in target tissue\u2013associated lymph nodes, Foxp3 expression in the lung, and IL-10 and TGF-1 levels in BALF. this immunosuppression could have beneficial effects with respect to asthma airway inflammation. IL-22 attenuates the allergic response in the lungs of mice, demonstrating the negative regulatory function of IL-22 in allergy [46]. IL-22 also appears important in the defense against severe chronic rhinosinusitis, which often develops from allergic rhinitis."}
