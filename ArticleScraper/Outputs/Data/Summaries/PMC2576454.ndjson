{"summary": "human Ads are dsDNA viruses grouped into six species. Species A, C, D, E, and F use different infectious entry pathways. no viral progeny is made during the infection of mouse cells in vitro. the extracytoplasmic induction is initiated by triggering the surface-expressed transmembrane protein toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 with certain non-nucleic viral constituents [16],[17],[18] or upon recognition of viral nucleic acids in the endosomes of specialized cells. TLR7, 8 and 9 signal through the adaptor molecule Myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) dsRNA and 5\u2032-triphosphate RNA produced during viral replication are sensed by the RNA helicases RIG-I and MDA-5 [23],[24],[25],[26],[27],[28]. this pathway has been extensively studied, mostly in virus-infected fibroblasts. the late phase of the IFN- response is regulated by positive feedback via the increased levels of IRF-7 elicited by IFN- production. the induction of type I IFN in mice has been recently studied. it was claimed that a part of the IFN- response is initiated by TLR9 and MyD88 signaling in pDCs and another part by cytosolic DNA recognition in non-pDCs. however, the induction was independent of IRF-3. we first examined how two types of human Ad, Ad3 (species B) and Ad R700 (species C) known to use distinct infectious entry routes, elicit an IFN- response in vivo. we then injected mice with an ultraviolet-inactivated Ad3 (Fig. S1B) or Ad R700, incapable of viral gene expression. a similar early-peaking IFN- response was obtained in mice injected with UV inactivated Ad R700. mice were infected with 1.21010 intact Ad3 or 3.61010 of UV-inactivated Ad3 and IFN- in plasma collected at the indicated time points was determined. actin mRNAs were determined in cells 6 h after Ad2 infection by RT-PCR. expression of early adenoviral genes negatively regulates type I IFN production. viral gene expression did not inhibit the production of IL-6 in either Ad3- or Ad R700-infected mice. further experiments revealed that heat-inactivated Ad did not elicit IFN- in mice. signal transduction leading to IFN- production is activated during Ad entry. EFs, L-929 cells infected with Ad2 produced no IFN- either. in order to identify the organ site of viral uptake and IFN- production in vivo, we analyzed the expression of the early viral gene E1A and of type I IFN mRNAs in the spleen, liver, lung and kidney of infected mice. both CD11c+ (DC-containing) and CD11c (non-DC) populations contained viral DNA. this finding is in accordance with the report of Morelli et al describing that both splenic DC and non-DC contain the virus in Ad-infected mice [49] however, quantitative RT-PCR determination of IFN- and IFN- mRNA in both populations revealed the presence of IFN- mRNAs predominantly in the DC-containing CD11c+ fraction the relative expression of IFN- (A, D), IFN- (B, E) and IL-6 (C) was measured in CD11c+ versus CD11c cells (A,B,C) and in the mDC, pDC and F4/80+CD11b subsets of CD11c+ cells (D, E) using real-time RT-PCR. splenic mDCs are the major IFN-- but not the dominant IL-6-producing cells in adenovirus infected mice. mDCs are the major IFN--, but not the dominant IL-6-producing cells in adenovirus infected mice. animals were injected with 1.21010 Ad3 particles. plasma levels of IFN- (A) and IL-6 (B) were measured 4 and 8 h after infection. ablation of mDCs in CD11cDTR/GFP transgenic mice affected only moderately the induction of IL-6. signaling via TLR9 was shown to be responsible for the strong type I IFN response of pDCs to Ad in vitro. Fig. 4A shows that TLR9/ mice produced normal levels of IFN-. upon infection with Ad3. comparable results were obtained with the recombinant Ad5-GFP (Fig. S7A) BMDC generated from wt, Myd88/ and TRIF/ mice were infected in vitro with 600, 1800 and 5400 Ad3 particles/cell or were mock-infected. the induction of IFN- and IL-6 in response to Ad infection is dependent on IFN- feedback signaling. production of both IFN- and IFN- is strictly dependent on positive IFN- feedback. the determination of IL-6 protein and mRNA levels in the same plasma and spleen tissue samples revealed that the induction of IL-6 is also positively regulated by IFN- signaling. mock immunoprecipitated samples showed no significant values for all samples. one representative experiment of three (D) or two (E) is shown. we also tested whether IFN-R-dependent signaling is involved in the IFN- response of Ad-infected BMDCs in vitro. Fig. 6 shows the patterns of IFN- genes induced in vivo and in vitro. included were IFN-2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14 and IFN-. all of them were induced in the spleen by Ad3 in vivo and in BMDC in vitro. IFN- subtypes were analyzed by real-time RT PCR in total RNA prepared from the spleen or from in vitro generated BMDCs of wt or IFN-R/ mice 8 h after infection with 6.21010 Ad3 particles/mouse. one representative experiment of two is shown. the critical role of IRF-7 but not IRF-3 in IFN- production induced by viruses or other pathogens. IFN- was measured in cell-free supernatants 16 h after infection (A) compared to wt mice, poly IC injected IRF-7 deficient mice produced significantly less, but still well detectable amounts of IFN-. bp1 may play a major role in the induction of the IFN- response to Ad. normal IFN- responses to Ad were obtained in BMDCs and BMMs. the responses to the known MDA-5 ligand Poly IC were abrogated. transfection of the gene-specific siRNA downregulated the expression of DAI/Zbp1 on both the mRNA and protein levels and efficiently inhibited the IFN- response to B-DNA. the results indicate that known nucleic acid sensors such as MDA-5, RIG-I and Zbp1/DAI are not involved in the type I IFN production. the pharmacological blockade of the SAPK/JNK MAPK almost completely inhibited the production of both IFN- and IL-6. in contrast, the inhibition of the p38 MAPK pathway partially inhibited the production of IL-6, but had no effect on the production of IFN-. BMDCs were pretreated with SP600125 or with diluent for 15 min. then infected with 5400 Ad3 or Ad5 particles/cell, or were mock-infected. plasma IFN- was measured 4 and 8 h after infection. infected mice with 3.61010 viral particles of wt Ad2 and Ad2Ts1 showed normal IFN- responses. the inability of Ad2Ts1 to escape from endosomes was confirmed by electron microscopy. escape from endosome is critical for the induction of IFN- and IL-6 by adenoviruses. plasma IFN- was measured 4 and 8 h (A) or 2 and 8 h (B) after infection. BMDCs were infected with 1800, 5400, and 16 200 particles of Ad2Ts1-32\u00b0C/cell or were mock-infected. a further increase in the Ad2Ts1 dose (2.161011 particles) resulted in detectable levels of plasma IFN- that were released with different kinetics. this already suggests a mechanism for type I IFN induction by Ad2Ts1 that is fundamentally different from the IFN- induction seen with wt. 1-infected mice deficient in MyD88, an essential component of TLR9 signaling. corresponding amount of empty particles (DNA-free) of Ad2Ts1 elicited no IFN- response in wt mice. these data illustrate the critical role of TLR9 in the induction of IFN- by means of high doses of Ad2Ts1. cells treated with this drug produced significantly reduced levels of IFN- and IL-6 respectively, in response to Ad3. this is consistent with the notion that Ad7 infection of cultured cells requires low endosomal pH [70],[71]. similar results were obtained using treatment with ammonium chloride. a severe impairment of the IFN- response to Ad was also observed. sensitization to LPS developed normally in Ad5-GFP-infected TLR9/ mice. only Ad5-GFP-infected wt, but not IFNR/ mice exhibited enhanced susceptibility to LPS shock. FNR/ mice were infected with 11010 Ad5 GFP particles i. p. or left uninfected. 16 h later mice were injected with 3.5 g LPS/gr. bw. induction of IFN- by adenovirus is elicited by viral entry and is inhibited by viral early gene expression. we investigated whether the expression of viral genes is required and/or regulate the induction of IFN- by Ads in vivo. IFN- and IL-6 responses to Ad infection in vivo and in vitro. Mice (4\u20135/group) were infected intraperitoneally with 1.21010 intact Ad3 or 3.61010 of UV-inactivated Ad3 and IFN- in plasma collected at the indicated time points was determined. 6 h and 8 h values were analyzed for statistical significance. 3 mice/group were infected i.p. with 1.21010 Ad3 particles. relative levels of IFN- and IFN- mRNA in organs were analyzed. c+ indicates a spleen sample from a Ad3-infected mice used as a positive control. we conclude that signal transduction leading to IFN- production is activated during Ad entry. BMDC and BMM, but not MEFs, produced IFN-. pDCs also produced IFN- in response to Ad infection in vitro. the present data confirm that Ads can trigger IFN- production in various immune cells in vitro. but it furthermore indicates that production does not proceed ubiquitously in all types of infected cells. we analyzed the expression of the early viral gene E1A and of type I IFN mRNAs in the spleen, liver, lung and kidney of Ad3-infected mice. quantitative RT-PCR determination of IFN- and IFN- mRNA in both populations revealed the presence of IFN- and IFN- mRNAs predominantly in the DC-containing CD11c+ fraction. mRNA levels of IL-6, another cytokine known to be induced by Ad, were comparably upregulated in both the CD11c+ and CD11c population. mDCs expressed significantly more IFN- than pDCs, but both mDCs and pDCs expressed similar amounts of IFN- or IFN-. mDCs comprise approximately 60% of all analyzed CD11c+ splenocytes and their numbers are approximately 10-times higher than pDCs. xin into the CD11c-diphtheria toxin receptor CD11cDTR/GFP transgenic mice [54] 24 h prior to infection with Ad. DT pre-treated CD11cDTR/GFP transgenic mice were challenged with Ad3 and examined for IFN- in plasma 4 and 8 h after infection. only marginal IFN- responses were found at both time-points. the efficacy of splenic DC depletions is shown in Fig. S5 and S6. the ablation of mDCs in CD11cDTR/GFP transgenic mice affected only moderately the induction of IL-6. this confirms that non-DCs contribute significantly to the Ad-elicited IL-6 response in vivo. Fig. 4A shows that TLR9/ mice produced normal levels of IFN-. upon infection with Ad3. comparable results were obtained with the recombinant Ad5-GFP. BMDC generated from wt, Myd88/ and TRIF/ mice were infected with 600, 1800 and 5400 Ad3 particles/cell or were mock-infected. the induction of IFN- and IL-6 in response to Ad infection is dependent on IFN- feedback signaling. BMDCs from wt and IFNR/ mice were mock-infected or infected with 600, 1800 and 5400 Ad3 particles/cell. IL6 was measured in cell-free supernatants 16 h (D) or 8 h (E) after infection. cells from IFN-R/ mice infected with Ad3 produced significantly less type I IFN than similarly infected cells from wt mice. loss of IFN- signaling also resulted in strong inhibition of the Ad induced IL-6 production in BMDCs and BMMs. IFN- subtypes were not detectable in the spleen of unstimulated mice or BMDCs. Fig. 6 shows the patterns of IFN- genes induced in vivo and in vitro in the presence or in the absence of IFN- feedback signaling. in wt mice and cells IFN-5 and IFN- were the most strongly expressed genes and IFN-13 was the least activated IFN- subtype. one representative experiment of two is shown. IFN-2, (2) IFN-4, (3) IFN-5, (4) IFN-6, (5) IFN-9, (6) IFN-11, (7) IFN-12, (8) IFN-14, (10) IFN-. n.d.: not detectable. t mice, poly IC injected IRF-7 deficient mice produced significantly less, but still well detectable amounts of IFN-. IFN- was measured in cell-free supernatants 16 h after infection. BMDCs from IRF-3/ mice were transfected with a GFP-expressing plasmid (transfection control) with or without RIG-IC and subsequently stimulated with Ad or control leader RNA. the transfection of RIG-IC prevented induction of IFN- mRNA by the leader RNA, but not by Ad. IFN- production after adenovirus induction is independent of known cytosolic nucleic acid sensors. BMDCs were infected with 0, 600, 1800 and 5400 Ad5GFP particles/cell. BMDCs were stimulated with synthetic poly IC (10 g/ml) or leader RNA complexed with Lipofectamine 2000. Fig. 9A and Fig. S11 show that the pharmacological blockade of the SAPK/JNK MAPK almost completely inhibited the Ad3-induced production of both IFN- and IL-6. the inhibition of the p38 MAPK pathway partially inhibited the production of IL-6, but had no effect on the production of IFN-. B6 Mice (4/group) were pretreated with the SP600125 inhibitor (20 mg/kg) i.p. or with diluent for 45 min. then infected with 3.61010 Ad5-GFP particles. plasma IFN- was measured 4 and 8 h after infection. we infected mice with 3.61010 viral particles of wt Ad2 and Ad2Ts1. wt virus did not induce detectable levels of type I IFN at 4 and 8 h after infection. IL-6 response was also severely reduced in these animals. IFN- levels were measured in plasma at the indicated time-points after infection (C) BMDCs were infected with 1800, 5400, and 16 200 particles of Ad2Ts1-32\u00b0C/cell or with 32 400 particles of Ad2Ts1-38.5\u00b0C/cell. the expression of E1A mRNA in the spleen 6 h after infection was analyzed by RT-PCR in samples from the individual Ts1-infected (lane 1, 2) and Ad2-infected (lane 3, 4) mice. a further increase in the Ad2Ts1 dose (2.161011 particles) resulted in detectable, albeit very low levels of plasma IFN- that were released with different kinetics. this already suggests a mechanism for type I I bensonase-treated Ad2Ts1 still induced an IFN- response in mice. we also tested the role of endosomal escape of Ad in the in vitro induction in BMDCs of IFN- and IL-6. this is consistent with the notion that Ad3 and Ad7 infection of cultured cells requires low endosomal pH. the late phase of the Ad infectious entry triggers an innate response characterized by the production of type I IFNs and IL-6. a characteristic consequence of infection with Ad, the induction of type I IFNs might be mediated by type I IFNs. for this purpose, we infected wt and IFNR/ mice with Ads, challenged them with LPS and measured the TNF- response. IFN- is an essential mediator of the LPS hypersensitivity induced by adenovirus infection. wild-type and IFN-R/ mice (4\u20136 mice/group) were infected i. p. with 11010 Ad3 particles. 16 h later the animals received 1 g LPS i. p. or diluent only. expression of mCD14 was measured on surface of splenic macrophages. expression of mCD14 was measured 16 h after infection. splenic macrophages from Ad infected mice overexpress receptor components mCD14 and TLR4/MD-2. the response is entirely independent of viral replication, TLR-, MyD88-, TRIF- and IRF-3-signaling. this is dependent on viral escape from the endosomes, activation of the SAPK/JNK pathway and IRF-7, and subsequent IFN- feedback signaling. this suggests an IFN- induction pathway that is different from the extracytoplasmic and cytoplasmic pathways so far described. IFN- subtypes induced by Ads in spleen of infected mice were markedly different. pDCs and other types of non-pDCs were suggested to be responsible for the type I IFN response in vivo. the ratio of pDCs to mDCs (approximately 11) was quite different from that we and others have found. bone marrow stromal antigen 2 (BST2) was shown to be up-regulated on numerous cell types following stimulation that triggers an IFN response. this is in accordance with the concept that in vivo macrophages make no significant contribution to the IFN- response to Ad. blockade of p38 MAPK in mDCs in vivo had no effect on IFN- production. but partially inhibited the production of IL-6. this effect could be explained at least in part by the positive regulatory effect of IFN- on IL-6 transcription. we excluded a major involvement of the cytoplasmic RNA sensors RIG-I and MDA-5 in the induction of IFN- by Ads. the pathway(s) of IFN- induction activated by cytosolic DNA is strictly dependent on IRF-3. adenoviral cysteine protease L3/23 is devoid of any IFN--inducing activity. a small fraction of the protease-lacking Ad2Ts1 still reaches the cytosol. this enzyme, apart from its involvement in maturation of viral proteins and endosomal escape, is essential for the stepwise disassembly of Ads. mouse embryonal fibroblasts do not produce IFN- upon Ad infection. but they posses efficient cytosolic induction pathways for dsRNA or dsDNA. further studies are required to identify the viral components and the host receptors involved. increased mCD14 expression on LPS target cells and epigenetic changes on promoters of relevant genes may explain the role of IFN- in the development of Ad induced LPS hypersensitivity. this response was observed also in patients with recombinant adenoviral vectors in vivo. o, in mice infected with different viruses, splenic mDCs are the major source of IFN- is surprising. expression levels of IFN- mRNAs in organs and cells from Ad-infected mice suggested a dominant role for splenic mDCs in the IFN- response. also, the IFN response to Ad was practically absent in mice depleted of CD11chigh MHC II+ myeloid DCs. the loss of TLR9 signaling resulted in a reduction of the IFN- response in mice infected with the recombinant species C Ad-lacZ. this finding suggested a significant contribution of TLR9, and therefore of pDCs, to the Ad-induced IFN- response in vivo. this may explain conflicting results on the role of TLR9 in vivo. in vivo macrophages make no significant contribution to the IFN- response to Ad. this is in agreement with the concept that in vivo macrophages make no significant contribution to the IFN- response to Ad. this is in agreement with the concept that in vivo macrophages make no significant contribution to the IFN- response to Ad. in myD88-, TRIF-, Unc93B and various TLR-deficient mice excluded a participation of TLRs in the IFN- responses to Ads, including the recombinant Ad5-GFP. however, compared to all other Ads used in this study, Ad2Ts1 induced very low levels of IFN-, with faster kinetics and only when used in very high amounts. IRF-3 is strictly dependent on IRF-3 and minimally on IRF-7. transfection of BMDCs with naked adenoviral DNA or with whole virions of the endosomal escape deficient Ad2Ts1 results in a strictly IRF-3 dependent IFN- response. findings do not exclude a requirement for dsDNA recognition in the induction of IFN-. a cytosolic dsDNA-signaling pathway, mediated by the RNA helicase RIG-I and MAVS, leads to the induction of IFN-. this pathway is absent in murine systems [22],[37],[84],[85] and is therefore unlikely to participate in the IFN- response of Ad-infected mice. adenoviruses, toxic effects and therapeutic applications may have important implications for Ad gene therapy applications. the adverse effects observed in therapeutic trials can be at least partly explained by the enhanced susceptibility of the Ad-infected host to microbial components, such as LPS [72] and lipopeptides. we assume that Ad-induced IFN- can induce LPS hypersensitivity in humans in vivo. andesirable complications mediated by IFN- can occur in immunocompromised patients. blocking SAPK/JNK signaling inhibits IFN- response to Ads. mice of both sexes, 8-12 weeks of age were used for the experiments. all of the experimental procedures were in accordance with institutional, state and federal guidelines on animal welfare. c+ CD11b B220+ CD62L+ pDCs were MoFlo sorted (purity higher than 95%) as described [55] mDCs were infected with the indicated amounts of Ads in growth medium containing 10% of donor serum. mouse L-929 cells were grown in DMEM with 10% FCS. cleic acids complexed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in 96-well plates.
