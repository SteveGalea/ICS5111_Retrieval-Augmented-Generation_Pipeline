{"summary": "public health agencies attend to a wide range of disease and health threats, including those that require routine, acute, and emergency responses. a number of challenges have been cited as barriers to research advancement in this field, including: the infrequent nature of large-scale public health emergencies [3], [5]\u2013[7], the heterogeneity of emergency events and of public health delivery structures [6], the limited ability for standardized surveys to measure complex agency and system processes [6], and the difficulty of identifying a comparison group public health emergency response is largely derived from simulated emergencies. simulated emergencies introduce artificialities that do not reflect real-world response situations. simulated emergencies introduce artificialities that do not reflect real-world response situations. governmental public health response has deviated from these expectations. such deviations can provide opportunities to improve and update our understanding of response performance. we focused this research on describing the public health response systems from the perspective of the local health department. a random sample of 169 local health departments from the remaining sampling frame, using a probability-proportional-to-size sampling strategy. a convenience sample of 14 local health departments included in the pilot phase, with whom the researchers either had a personal connection or had learned about their involvement in incidents through an online disease outbreak alerting system, HealthMap.org [19]. interviews were conducted by phone using a structured interview tool. participants were offered a customized report that would summarize their interview. participants were also entered into a raffle for the chance to receive monetary prizes. the CDC Public Health Preparedness Capabilities framework identifies and defines 15 types of services public health systems might be expected to deliver during emergencies. the framework identifies and defines 15 types of services public health systems might be expected to deliver during emergencies. a summary score was calculated by summing the total number of public health response activities initiated during an event. participants were asked to specify whether public health served in the lead role, joint-lead role with another responding agency, or supporting role. a list of 41 organizations types was developed once all interviews were completed. a summary measure of the total number of organizational categories mentioned in the interviews was calculated. a summary measure of the total number of organizational categories mentioned in the interviews was calculated (between 0 and 41 organizations) alternative explanatory variables. participants\u2019 provided verbal informed consent to participate and to have the research interview audiorecorded. this consent process is consistent with our institutional review board's requirements for research with exempt status and with our approved research protocols. study invitations were emailed to preparedness coordinators and health officers for selected LHDs. each round of recruitment lasted six weeks, during which individuals were sent the initial email invitation and study description. participants were also informed that they could forward the invitation to another person within the health department who might be better positioned to participate. interviewers were extensively trained on the intent of each question in the instrument, administration protocols, and response coding. each event was characterized with respect to a number of contextual features. a non-adaptive response system would engage similar functions and partners based on the type of incident. public health response activities are the first of our primary outcome variables. the response activities are the first of our two primary outcome variables. we deviated from this framework for the purpose of data collection in three key ways. participants were asked to identify organizations and agencies that contributed to that activity. a list of 41 organizations was developed once all interviews were completed. the categorization of organizations was based on the descriptions of the public health system in the literature and expert opinion. the differences between infectious disease and non-infectious disease events were assessed using t tests or chi-square tests. results Sample demographics Of the 354 recruited local health departments, participants from 123 health departments completed an interview. participants from 123 health departments completed an interview, resulting in a 35% response rate. participants represented health departments in 38 of 48 states targeted for recruitment. agencies served populations from 50,000 to several million residents, reported annual expenditures ranging from $1 to more than $500 per capita. participating agencies were significantly more likely to serve a larger population. s n % of Participants % of LHDs Nationwide 1 Governing authority Centralized authority at the state 18 15 19 Decentralized, authority at the local level 84 69

vertical bars show the proportion of events that involved each of the 19 defined response activities. the horizontal gray bars provide the percent of events for which that activity was perceived to be \u201cessential\u201d within infectious disease events. in 82% of events this activity was felt to be essential. emergency operations management, volunteer management, and mass care and sheltering remained more common in non-infectious disease events. participants identified \u201cother\u201d public health activities that were carried out in the response to their event. activities most commonly reported to be essential were epidemiology/surveillance and laboratory testing. figure 4a shows the public health response system profile for each of six different types of events. the green vertical

events. multiple linear regression models were used to assess the relationship between the community and agency measures (predictor variables: size of the population served by a LHD, number of FTEs, and annual per capita expenditures) each of the six models included a single predictor and outcome variable, controlling for the type of event. participants represented health departments in 38 of 48 states targeted for recruitment, with a diversity of community and public health agency characteristics. these agencies served populations from 50,000 to several million residents, reported annual expenditures ranging from $1 to more than $500 per capita, and had staffing levels between 10 and more than 1,000 Full-Time Equivalents.

Table 2. List of events. more than half indicated that this was the only event of its kind in recent history (29% of events) other events occurred with a greater frequency, from one to two times per year (28%) to three or more times per year (13%). a mean of 37 confirmed or probable cases per event resulted in hospitalization or death. a t-test comparison of the log-transformed variables, duration of response and number of probable or confirmed cases revealed that infectious disease events involved significantly more cases (p0.05) than non-infectious disease events. of the 19 activity categories, urgent event response efforts involved between 3 and 18 types of activities. response activities most commonly initiated were information sharing and management (100% of events), public health surveillance and epidemiology (98%), emergency public information and warning (89%), non-pharmaceutical interventions (88%), non-pharmaceutical interventions (88%), environmental or product investigation (82%), consulting subject matter experts (79%), public health laboratory testing (74%), and emergency operations management (65%). severe weather and natural disaster events constituted majority of non-infectious disease events. sensitivity analysis found that infectious disease and non-infectious disease events did not differ significantly with respect to the number of response activities. only differences in type of activity that persisted were: dispensing of medical countermeasures, which was still more common in infectious disease events. public health response systems comprised of 3 to 25 types of organizations, with a mean of 10 organizations. the types of organizations mentioned as contributors in more than half of the urgent event responses included: local public health agencies, including environmental health (98% of events); state public health agencies (92%); healthcare providers (78%); members of the general public. the difference in the number of response partners between infectious disease and non-infectious disease events remained significant after excluding severe weather events. however, only half of the previously observed differences in the types of response partners remained. participants from health departments in which governmental authority is centralized at the state level were significantly more likely to choose non-infectious disease events as the subject for the interview. participants from health departments in which governmental authority is centralized at the state level were significantly more likely to choose non-infectious disease events as the subject. public health representatives described their experiences responding to more than 120 incidents involving unusual clusters of illness, unexpected exposures to hazardous substances, or sudden loss of infrastructure. more than half of the health departments described an event that happens once every few years or an event that was the only one of its kind in recent history. study and dissemination of lessons learned from near-miss incidents serves as a cornerstone for learning and improvement. study demonstrates that it is possible to identify meaningful insights from a large set of real world events. lessons may have relevance in other public health settings and contexts. public health departments were ten times more likely to serve in a lead role for infectious disease events compared to events involving severe weather. public health departments were ten times more likely to serve in a lead role for infectious disease events. in the second model of response, typical of severe weather and natural disasters, public health agencies serve in a joint or supporting role to the overall response. response activities and partners are more numerous and diverse; disruption to community infrastructure defines event severity; and environmental health and mass sheltering and care activities are considered most essential to the response. our study finds that certain types of events were much more likely to elicit response activities related to specific capabilities. the frequencies with which capability-related activities were performed did not necessarily equate with how \u201cessential\u201d that capability was to the overall event. the CDC PHEP Capabilities framework may be of particular value to preparedness planners. fewer than ten percent of the events included in this investigation were published in the peer-reviewed literature or other professional information-sharing web portals. fewer than ten percent of events included in this investigation were published in the peer-reviewed literature or other professional information-sharing web portals. our approach draws strength from the application of a systems-based and functions-based approach, both seen as essential features of high-quality research in this field. the results describe responses to a wide range of incidents, but our method of event-finding did not draw from a sample that is statistically representative of all health departments. we did not claim to know anything about the events that were not selected. however, it is not possible to know how representative our set of events really is. we do know that the distribution of event types in our sample is similar to that found in other research. some entities are likely to take part in a public health response of any nature, including public health agencies, healthcare providers, and members of the general public. many other organizations are either infrequently involved in public health responses or typically have a role only under specific event circumstances. conceptual models of response could provide the basis for a new avenue of planning that builds on the strengths of those currently used. response models are grounded in concrete real-world incidents, making it easier to conceptualize the likely functional and structural aspects of a response. our results complement the PHEP Capabilities by highlighting the circumstances in which related activities or functions might have particular relevance in practice. the frequency with which capability-related activities were performed did not necessarily equate with how \u201cessential\u201d that capability was to the overall event. fewer than 10 percent of the events included in this investigation were published in the peer-reviewed literature or other professional information-sharing web portals. fewer than ten percent of the events included in this investigation were published in the peer-reviewed literature or other professional information-sharing web portals. study adopted broad definition of urgent events, thereby expanding case material on public health responses. daniel sturridge: this is a fairly new field of research, but the use of in-depth interviews for data collection was invaluable. he says our approach draws strength from the application of a systems-based and functions-based approach. sturridge: we hope to be able to contribute to the scientific literature in a way that is standardized. non-participants health departments were significantly more likely to serve a larger population, have higher public health expenditures per capita, and have more full-time staff. participants selected a single event, which is one of many from which they could have potentially chosen. however, it is not possible to know how representative our set of events really is. we recommend that future studies examine the types of events that were less commonly reported in our sample. we suggest continued use of standardized data gathering to ensure that future guidance, policy, and research is grounded in the best evidence learned through real-world events."}
