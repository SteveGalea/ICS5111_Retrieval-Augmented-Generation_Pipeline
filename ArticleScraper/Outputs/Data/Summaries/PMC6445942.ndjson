{"summary": "PERSPECTIVE In recent decades, new human infectious diseases have emerged. well-known diseases have reemerged because of human movement, crowding, and other population factors. outbreak acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) is characterized by sudden denervation-associated muscle paralysis of healthy children in one or more limbs. long-recognized syndrome of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) (9, 10), in which cord myelitis is documented. term AFP subsumes additional causes of flaccid paralysis such as trauma, tumors, and immunopathologic disorders. clusters of cases began to be recognized in 1840, with larger epidemics documented in 1881 and in the united states in 1894. in temperate climates, NPEVs circulate together endemically and epidemically every late summer/fall, causing localized outbreaks of aseptic meningitis and other conditions. immunity to NPEVs is near-universal by early childhood (10), some continure to occur because there are many different NPEV types. as many as 60,000 documented cases of nonpolio AFP are reported annually. cases are predominantly associated with NPEVs or Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. sporadic AFM is not rare, but its sudden appearance in epidemic form is unprecedented. despite coclustering of AFM and EV-D68, viruses are rarely isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) a precipitating EV-D68 infection may well have run its course by the time of onset and diagnosis of AFM, several days to a week later. EV-D68 is a major cause of epidemic AFM, while circumstantial, is nonetheless strong. epidemiologic evidence that EV-D68 is a major cause of epidemic AFM is strong. it is also appropriate to consider whether epidemic AFM results only from high-level epidemic circulation of viruses such as EV-D68 and EV-A71. a related question is how to explain the paradox of EV-D68 epidemics in populations with virtually 100% preexisting neutralizing antibody to EV-D68. a related question is how to explain the paradox of EV-D68 epidemics in populations with virtually 100% preexisting antibody to EV-D68, e.g., 2012\u20132013 preepidemic data from Kansas City, Missouri. a major challenge in the study of this disease is that AFM is an uncommon, sporadically occurring complication of a common infection that is difficult to diagnose with viral specificity. a major challenge in the study is that AFM is an uncommon, sporadically occurring complication of a common infection that is difficult to diagnose with viral specificity. a new term for a subset of cases of the long-recognized syndrome of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) (9, 10), in which cord myelitis is documented. the term AFP subsumes additional causes of flaccid paralysis such as trauma, tumors, and immunopathologic disorders. in temperate climates, NPEVs circulate together endemically and epidemically every late summer/fall, causing localized outbreaks of aseptic meningitis and other conditions. immunity to NPEVs is near-universal by early childhood (10), but infections continure to occur because there are many different NPEV types. as many as 60,000 documented cases of nonpolio AFP are reported annually. cases are predominantly associated with NPEVs or Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. multiple NPEVs have been closely linked to thousands of AFP and AFM cases. the EV-D68/AFM epidemiological association has become unmistakable. despite coclustering of AFM and EV-D68, viruses are often not identified from AFM cases. a precipitating EV-D68 infection may well have run its course by the time of onset and diagnosis of AFM. polio epidemic has been associated with cases of cranial nerve paralysis, bulbar paralysis, and meningoencephalitis (3, 20). intracellular virus may not be released into the (anatomically distant) spinal fluid and thus detected by lumbar puncture. EV-D68-induced pathogenic processes associated with early brief low-level viral replication and early transient viremia might well lead to AFM without providing good opportunity for viral detection. a related question is how to explain the paradox of EV-D68 epidemics in populations with virtually 100% preexisting antibody to EV-D68. a related question is how to explain the paradox of EV-D68 epidemics in populations with virtually 100% preexisting neutralizing antibody to EV-D68, e.g., 2012\u20132013 preepidemic data from Kansas City, Missouri (33). therapy for polio was developed to address each of the three conceptual stages of acute, convalescent, and chronic polio paralytic disease (36, 37). specific therapeutic goals targeted loss of flexibility, loss of muscle power, potential for residual deformity, loss of skill, and loss of functional stamina. the trajectory of AFM over the past 5 years suggests that the problem is getting worse. it is critical that we galvanize our efforts to learn more about, and respond adequately to this ubiquitous, often crippling, continually reemerging group of viruses."}
