{"summary": "weekend-extension strategies were designed to extend regular two-day weekend by one, two and three days, respectively, and in combination with either a continuous or discontinuous pattern. results If extensions last more than two days, the weekend-extension strategies can remarkably reduce the overall disease attack rate of seasonal flu. non-pharmaceutical mitigation strategies have been embedded in the latest framework of influenza prevention and control recommended by the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. they are critical because they represent the only type of intervention measure guaranteed to be available against a novel strain of influenza in the early phases of a pandemic. an individual has 24 more personal contacts during weekend than weekdays. a study of university students found that individuals made 26 contacts per day during weekdays, but only 19 per day during weekend. extending the weekend period might be an effective strategy to mitigate influenza outbreaks. s of extensions were investigated, including one, two and three days. the combination of the two dimensions (3 lengths 2 patterns) resulted in six strategies to be evaluated. individuals were assumed to follow activity patterns of either Saturday or Sunday. census data was used to build the nighttime population of individuals and households. the nighttime population was assigned to business locations to create the pastime population. the average number of contacts at the weekend is 2.4 fewer than that in the weekday. five infectious individuals were randomly seeded into the study area at the first day of simulation. the simulation took a tri-daily time step and lasted for 200 days. each time step, an individual held one of four infection status, i.e., susceptible, latent, infectious, or recovered. baseline outbreak represented a 'no response' situation with no strategies applied. the six weekend-extension strategies were assumed to be implemented when the cumulative number of influenza cases exceeded 1,000 (about 1 of the population) the simulation results were aggregated into a daily epidemic curve. the simulation results were converted from points of infections to grid cells of infections per km2 as infection intensity maps. the cell size was set to 50 50 m because it approximated the average extent of land parcels in the study area. ations Patterns Lengths (day) Continuous Discontinuous One Monday (Mon) Wednesday (Mon + Tue) Tuesday + Thursday (Mon+Tue+Wed) three Monday + Wednesday (Mon+Tue+Wed) Monday + Wednesday (Mon+Wed+Fri) Study area and data collection The six proposed strategies were investigated in the urbanized area of Buffalo, new york, US. the nighttime population was assigned to business locations to create the nighttime population. the pastime population was generated based on the travel time to work and industrial types of business locations. the research further distinguished the weekday and weekend activities of individuals. asymptomatic and infectious, followed by 4-7 days infectious varying over age groups. a proportion of symptomatic individuals was selected to withdraw to home. transmission of influenza was simulated by repeatedly tracing susceptible contacts of infectious individuals. the six weekend-extension strategies were assumed to be implemented when the cumulative number of influenza cases exceeded 1,000 (about 1 of the population) the results were aggregated into a daily epidemic curve, which depicted the number of new influenza cases per day during the course of an epidemic. an outbreak was deemed to be successfully controlled if the overall attack rate can be reduced below 10% [5] the modeled epidemic curve under R0 = 1.4 matched well with the observed time course of a seasonal flu outbreak in year 2004-05. this is because a large proportion of infected people may not manifest symptoms or seek health care. the pandemic flu caused an earlier and higher epidemic peak with more influenza cases. the three continuous weekend-extension strategies did not perform as effectively as in the seasonal flu scenario. only the three-day continuous extension can significantly lower the overall attack rate from 26% to 20%. all three strategies were not capable of controlling the pandemic flu independently. bRelative effectiveness = (Baseline attack rate -Strategy-specific attack rate)/Baseline attack rate. a95%CI stands for 95% confidence intervals from 50 model realizations. the intensity maps divided the study area into three zones. the zonel delineation was based on densities of households and businesses. the entire study area was dominated by high intensity of infections. the 'Mon+Tue+Wed' strategy mitigated infections in all three zones. only the three-day discontinuous extension ('Mon+Wed+Fri') with a 90% compliance level can control the seasonal flu (attack rate 10%) if the compliance could be raised to 100%, the three-day extension would be adequate to prevent the seasonal flu epidemic (attack rate 5%). 5% 15.73 (15.63, 15.83) 0.15 25.23 (25.17, 25.29) 0.09 25.70 (25.62, 25.77) 0.03 Mon+Wed+ 100% 5.49 (1.59, 6.88) 0.69

weekend-extension strategies given R0 = 1.4 and compliance level = 100%. each 50 m 50 m cell value indicates the total number of infections during the 200 days at the cell location. the pandemic flu (R0 = 2.0) caused an earlier and higher epidemic peak with more influenza cases, because this virus strain is far more contagious and spreads faster. the simulation model performed well in predicting the time trend, and at least allowed a representation of the worse case result. only the three-day continuous extension can significantly lower the overall attack rate from 26% to 20%. all three strategies were not capable of controlling the pandemic flu independently. bRelative effectiveness = (Baseline attack rate -Strategy-specific attack rate)/Baseline attack rate. a95%CI stands for the 95% confidence intervals from 50 model realizations. the entire study area was dominated by high intensity of infections (>200 infections per km2) the 'Mon+Tue+Wed' strategy mitigated infections in all three zones, but could not downsize the affected areas. the affected areas were largely reduced, leaving the extensive suburb with only a small number of infection clusters. discontinuous weekend-extension strategies failed to reduce the attack rate below 20%. even the three-day extension strategy with a 100% compliance level failed to reduce the attack rate below 20%. a95%CI stands for the 95% confidence intervals from 50 model realizations. the overall attack rates and relative effectiveness resulted from three discontinuous weekend-extension strategies. a majority of the study area underwent a high intensity above 200 infections per km2. all percentages are averages of 50 randomly seeded simulation runs. share of infections (%) were calculated by counting number of infections occurring at each type of location, and dividing it by the total number of infections during the epidemic. longer and less frequent interruptions on influenza transmission would be more effective in disease control than shorter and more frequent interruptions. a discontinuous weekend extension allows disease transmission between household members, but eliminates the transmission among co-workers for a relative long period (e.g., 35 days) the three-day continuous extension strategy is the most effective to confine the spatial spread of seasonal flu. many infectious individuals stay home for 5 consecutive days, \"using up\" the infectious period of influenza. the weekend-extension strategy may involve milder issues than other non-pharmaceutical strategies. weekend-extension strategy could be a feasible measure for countries with limited health resources, because no stockpiles of vaccines and antiviral drugs are needed. influenza is taken as an example in this research, but it is believed that the concept of weekend extensions can also help fight emerging infectious diseases that are poorly understood and unprepared for."}
