{"summary": "retrospective observational study at a single, university-affiliated center was performed to evaluate the respiratory viral infection etiologies in children compared to that in adults. the common viruses detected from children were human rhinovirus (hRV) (31.8%), adenovirus (AdV) (19.2%), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A (17.4%), RSV B (11.7%), and human metapneumovirus (9.8%). acute respiratory infection is a major cause of morbidity, hospitalization, and mortality with a worldwide disease burden estimated at 113 million disability-adjusted life years and 3.5 million deaths. acute respiratory infection is a major cause of morbidity, hospitalization, and mortality with a worldwide disease burden estimated at 113 million disability-adjusted life years. isolation rate for each respiratory virus was defined as the ratio of the number of patients showing the presence of the given virus divided by the total number of specimens submitted for multiple real-time PCR assay. the presence of influenza virus (IFA/IFB), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV A, RSV B), parainfluenza virus (PIV 1-4), adenovirus (AdV), human rhinovirus (hRV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), the Seeplex RV15 assay kit contained primers designed from conserved regions of genetic sequences for the 15 respiratory viruses mentioned above. an initial pre-PCR step of 94\u00b0C for 15 minutes was performed, followed by a total of 35 PCR cycles according to manufacturer's instructions. chi-squared test and t-test were performed, respectively, to compare the characteristics of adult patients with solitary viral detection and bacterial co-detection. laboratory procedures Most of the samples were collected by nasopharyngeal swab, nasopharyngeal aspiration, or throat swab. nosocomial infections were excluded by identifying and omitting cases in which respiratory symptoms developed 2 days after admission. a -PCR step of 94\u00b0C for 15 minutes was performed. the types of respiratory virus were identified by comparison with the reference band size provided by the manufacturer. chi-squared test and t-test were performed to compare the characteristics of adult patients. combining rates were greater than 100% because of co-infection. hRV, human rhinovirus; AdV, adenovirus; RSV, respiratory syncytial virus; hMPV, human metapneumovirus; PIV, parainfluenza virus; hBoV, human bocavirus; EV, enterovirus; IFA, influenza A virus; hMPV (29, 14.0%) despite lower detection, hMPV showed a seasonal pattern (March to May) similar to that of IFB. common comorbidities were diabetes mellitus and malignancy. solitary IFA, IFB, RSV A, RSV B, PIV 1-4, AdV, hMPV, hRV and hCoV-OC43 infection. multiple virus detection was observed in 868 children (22.4%) and 11 adults (2.0%) bacterial sputum culture was performed for 140 patients (84.3%) for these patients, bacteria were isolated in 44 cases (26.5%). cases with bacterial co-detection were more likely to have lower respiratory tract involvement. median patient age was 27 months, with 57.3% of participants being 1-5 years of age. most commonly identified pathogens were hRV (889, 31.8%), AdV (537, 19.2%), RSV A (486, 17.4%), RSV B (328, 11.7%), and hMPV (273, 9.8%). hCoV-229E, hCoV-OC43, hBoV, and EV were excluded from this analysis because the isolated numbers were too low. IFA, IFB, RSV A, RSV B, and hMPV showed strong seasonal patterns. the common comorbidities were diabetes mellitus, chronic renal disease, and malignancy. but nasal congestion and rhinorrhea were more common with hRV (82.8%) and hCoV-OC43 (69.2%) infection. lower respiratory infection was found in about 50% of patients for most viruses. solitary pathogens were more likely to be identified as solitary pathogens. hRV, EV, and hMPV were more likely to be identified as co-infections. the number of total co-detections was too low in adults. a microbiologic database was reviewed to identify the prevalence of 15 viruses in the hospitalized children and adults with acute respiratory infection. compared to the respiratory virus isolation rate in adults, the isolation rate was low in adults. hRV had the highest isolation rate, followed by AdV, RSV A/B, and hMPV, in children. differences likely originated from distinct study designs and patient populations. hRV and IFA/IFB were major pathogens associated with hospitalization. the number of cases was too small to compare the clinical outcomes. the occurrence of staphylococcal and pneumococcal pneumonia complicating Spanish influenza pandemics is well known. clinical diagnosis based on patient's age and clinical features should be made with discretion. real-time PCR assays should be considered in severe and complicated patients. etiology of respiratory viral infection appears to differ according to the patient's age."}
