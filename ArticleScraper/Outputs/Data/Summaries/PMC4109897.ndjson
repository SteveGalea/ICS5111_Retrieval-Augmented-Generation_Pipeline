{"summary": "despite the sustained threat of the virus, there is no approved vaccine or antiviral therapy against CHIKV. despite the sustained threat of the virus, there is no approved vaccine or antiviral therapy against CHIKV. it is critical to develop a vaccine that is both well tolerated and highly protective. CHIKV is the etiologic agent of chikungunya fever. large outbreaks have occurred on la R\u00e9union island. autochthonous transmission has been seen in Europe. adenovirus expressing the complete CHIKV structural poly-protein has been described and was shown to be immunogenic and protective in mice [19] there currently are no licensed vaccines or antiviral treatments available for CHIKV. adenovirus based-vectors may limit this approach. MVA has been extensively tested as a vaccine vector, expressing viral, bacterial or parasite antigens. it has been shown to induce both humoral and cell-mediated protective immune responses. a vectored CHIKV vaccine would be an attractive option for resource-limited countries. depletion of CD4+ T cells in vaccinated mice resulted in loss of protection, with 100% succumbing to infection upon challenge with wild-type CHIKV. CHIK-IRES vaccine candidate was previously described as a positive control. a recombinant MVA virus expressing GFP (herein called MVA-GFP) was based on the wild-type MVA. it was cloned into a specially modified poxvirus transfer vector, pI2-Red. the vector contained flanking sequences that when transfected into MVA-GFP infected cells can recombine into the Deletion III region of the viral genome. MVA-CHIK was created by transfecting the plasmid containing CHIKV p62 under control of a se/l promoter. this plasmid contains flanking regions to deletion III (DelIII) this is where the recombinant gene was inserted into the genome with a fluorescent marker (A) red represents CHIKV E2 positive cells, red is dsRed protein produced by the virus and blue is nuclear staining with Hoechst. recombinant virus-generated plaques were detected by observing fluorescence and picked into 300 L media with a sterile filter pipette tip. DNA was extracted using the quick-gDNA Miniprep kit from Zymo Research per manufacturer's instructions. PCR was then performed using Phusion polymerase with deletion III specific primers. cells were seeded at 3.0105 cells/well into six-well plates. BHK-21 cells were used for immunocytochemistry experiments. one day prior to infection, 2105 cells were plated onto glass coverslips. infection was allowed to progress for 24 hrs and fixed using 2% paraformaldehyde solution. serum samples from mice inoculated with CHIK-IRES were serially diluted from 1100\u2013112,800 in ELISA diluent. 100 L per well of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgM+G was added to each well and incubated at RT for 1 hr. the highest dilution that was positive was considered the endpoint. a dose of 1107 TCID50 units in 50 L was used for all MVA vaccinations. as a positive control, mice were vaccinated with experimental control vaccine virus CHIK-IRES [17] at a dose of 104 TCID50 units. to ten-week-old mice were vaccinated i.d. with 107 TCID50 units of MVA-CHIK on day 0 and boosted day 28. each treatment group was challenged i.d. with 500 TCID50 units of CHIKV-LR three days later. each treatment group was challenged i.d. with 500 TCID50 units of CHIKV-LR three days later. a serum sample was taken ten days post-vaccination to measure neutralizing antibodies. for studies with prime and boost serum samples were collected on days 28 and 42 post-primary vaccination. the samples were stained intracellularly for IFN- APC (XMG1.2), IL-2 PE (JES6-5H4), TNF- PE (MP6-XT22) and CD40L (MR1). survival analysis was performed to assess vaccine effectiveness against. chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) were obtained from Charles River (Charles River Laboratories International, Inc., Wilmington, MA) and maintained in OptiMEM (invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) the virus was used for both the construction of recombinant poxviruses and challenge experiments. the expression of p62 was controlled by a synthetic early/late Vaccinia virus promoter and used the Vaccinia virus transcription terminator. this vector contained flanking sequences that when transfected into MVA-GFP infected cells can recombine into the Deletion III region of the viral genome. the different areas where deletion occurred in the vaccinia virus genome to create MVA-CHIK are shown. cellular pellet and supernatant were analyzed for expression of CHIKV E3/E2. cells for immunostaining were either allowed to remain intact or permeabilized with triton X-100 (D) recombinant virus-generated plaques were detected by observing fluorescence. they were picked into 300 L media with a sterile filter pipette tip. PCR analysis was performed on final virus stocks to ensure genetic homogeneity and stability. supernatants were diluted into 2 Laemmli buffer (Bio-Rad), heated at 95\u00b0C for 5 min and loaded into a Bio-Rad 4\u201320% precast gel. gels were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using trans-Blot Turbo Blotting System following manufacturer's instructions. cells were mounted using Vectashield mounting medium. images were acquired using an Evos microscope with attached camera. 96-well ELISA plates were coated with purified CHIKV. imetry was measured using an ELx800 absorbance microplate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT) at test wavelength of 450 nm and a reference wavelength of 630 nm. the highest dilution that was positive was considered the endpoint, and its reciprocal value was recorded as the titer. 100 L (BALB/c) or 200 L (A129) of this inoculum were then injected into naive mice intraperitoneally (i.p.) mice were bled three days consecutively to monitor viremia via the maxillary vein. histopathology performed on tissues collected from mice 7 days post infection (d.p.i.) Footpad and leg tissues were severed from euthanized mice, cut in half to expose the tissues. Hind limbs were then decalcified in 4% PFA containing 14% EDTA for 3\u20134 weeks, changing decalcification solution weekly. the mixture was added to 96 well plates seeded with Vero cells. the mixture was monitored for 3\u20134 days for presence of cytopathic effects. the presence of E3/E2 was confirmed in MVA-CHIK by a band at the expected size of roughly 3 kb. DNA sequencing confirmed that no genetic alterations were present in the final construct. expression of p62 antigen by the recombinant viruses and wild-type CHIKV was monitored by immunoblot analysis. a single cell set was permeabilized to determine if the protein was reaching the surface of the cells. a single cell set was permeabilized while the other set remained intact. this indicated that CHIKV E3/E2 proteins were being maintained inside the cell and not reaching the cell surface. mice were vaccinated with either prime alone or a prime and boost of each vaccine virus. mice were then challenged with 102 TCID50 units of wild-type CHIKV intradermally. cinated mice showed low levels of inflammation (A) upon infection with 102 TCID50 units of wild-type CHIKV. mice developed massive inflammation with necrotic muscle degeneration and edema following challenge (B) immunogenicity and protection in BALB/c mice. 100 L for BALB/c and 200 L for A129 were then injected into mice. survival was monitored for two weeks post-challenge. pooled immune serum was passively transferred into nave A129 mice. 4+ T cells produced the cytokine IFN and upregulated co-stimulatory molecule CD40L at significantly higher levels as compared to MVA-GFP vector control. no response was observed when MVA-CHIK splenocytes were stimulated with peptide pools against either E3 or NSP2 (viral protein negative control) no cytokine production in CD8+ T cells was observed. we depleted CD4+ or CD8+ T cells from vaccinated mice prior to challenge with wt-CHIKV. mice depleted of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells also had footpad swelling. the presence of E3/E2 was confirmed in MVA-CHIK by a band at the expected size of roughly 3 kb. in addition, DNA sequencing confirmed that no genetic alterations were present in the final construct. expression of p62 antigen by the recombinant viruses and wild-type CHIKV was monitored by immunoblot analysis. a single cell set was permeabilized in order to determine if the protein was reaching the surface of the cells. a single cell set was permeabilized while the other set remained intact. this indicated that CHIKV E3/E2 proteins were being maintained inside the cell and not reaching the cell surface. mice were vaccinated with either prime alone or a prime and boost (day 28) of each vaccine virus. mice were then challenged with 102 TCID50 units of CHIK-IRES. CHIK vaccinated mice showed low levels of inflammation (A) upon infection with 102 TCID50 units of wild-type CHIKV. viremia was not detected in any of the vaccinated mice (n = 6). s of serum (100 L for BALB/c and 200 L for A129) were then injected into mice. survival was monitored for two weeks post-challenge. pooled immune serum was passively transferred into nave A129 mice. CHIK immune CD4+ T cells produced the cytokine IFN and upregulated co-stimulatory molecule CD40L at significantly higher levels as compared to MVA-GFP vector control. no response was observed when MVA-CHIK splenocytes were stimulated with peptide pools against either E3 or NSP2 (viral protein negative control) no cytokine production in CD8+ T cells was observed. mice depleted of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells had no footpad swelling. mice depleted of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells also had high levels of viremia and footpad swelling. several groups have employed varying strategies to construct effective vaccines against CHIKV. live-attenuated, inactivated, adenovirus vectored, DNA, and VLP based strategies have been tested and have been shown to be effective in providing protection against CHIKV. despite promising results, these vaccine candidates all have some drawbacks. 80% of mice were protected from lethal challenge with wtCHIKV. vaccinated mice developed undetectable levels of neutralizing antibodies. however, they did produce a significant amount of anti-virus antibodies. previous reports have shown that it could be an effective immunogen against other alphaviruses. absence of E2 on the surface of infected cells is not completely unexpected. this could explain the lack of a strong humoral immune response. new studies have shown that a correlate of protection based on antibodies can be established for CHIKV. this is specific to the vaccine being used and that there may be more than one way to provide protection against CHIKV. s are required for recall responses to produce antibodies following challenge. this is unlikely as mice would be expected to have early viremia. our data are contrary to previous report by Teo et al. (2013). the vaccine constructed by Garcia-Arriaza et al. (2014) uses the entire structural protein consisting of Capsid-E3-E2-6K-E1. the vaccine contains immunodominant epitopes for both B and T cells [55], [82], and was therefore excluded from our vaccine construct in favor of E2."}
