{"summary": "worldwide, scavenging bird populations are rapidly declining. in africa, eight species of vulture have declined by an average of 62% in recent decades. infectious diseases, including rabies, plague and canine distemper, are expected to increase. the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) is found mostly in western north America. the California condor is listed as critically endangered [25] and an intensive captive breeding program initiated in the 1980s has succeeded in the reintroduction of free-flying condor populations in California, Arizona and Baja California, Mexico. adenoviruses have been implicated in outbreaks involving three species of falcons. adenoviruses have been implicated in outbreaks involving three species of falcons. adenoviruses have been implicated in outbreaks involving three species of falcons. mycoplasma gallisepticum and M. synoviae are economically important pathogens in poultry, causing respiratory disease (M. gallisepticum and M. synoviae) and synovitis (M. synoviae) mycoplasma gallisepticum has been associated with respiratory disease in peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus) [56] and other wild avian species [57]. oal parasite was reported to cause fatal myocarditis of a bald eagle [71]. the aim of our study was to obtain baseline data on the seroprevalence of common avian pathogens that could pose a threat to condors, turkey vultures and golden eagles. study populations and sites Free-flying California condors were sampled between September 2010 and January 2011 at three release sites in California. samples were obtained from 28 California condors in captivity at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park (SDZSP) and 13 California condors in captivity at the Los Angeles Zoo (LAZ) these birds were held in captivity throughout their lives and were never released to the wild prior to sample collection. serological testing for avian adenovirus, Chlamydophila psittaci, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was performed at Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory (College Station, TX) using assays optimized for poultry species. exposure status for the three strains of IBV was determined by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay. a titer of 1:32 or greater on the HI assay was considered positive for each of the three paramyxoviruses. a titer of 1:32 or greater was considered positive for each of the three paramyxoviruses. free-flying condors that had a high WNV titer were also screened for active WNV infection by PCR on whole blood (n = 9) tissue samples were screened for presence of avian adenovirus, coronavirus (including infectious bronchitis virus), paramyxovirus and mycoplasma spp. seroprevalence for each pathogen was estimated along with 95% confidence intervals. the two-sided Fisher\u2019s exact test was used to compare seroprevalences between free-flying condor release locations, between the three scavenger bird species, and between captive and free-flying condors. study populations and sites Free-flying California condors (n = 96) were sampled between September 2010 and January 2011 at three release sites in California. serum samples were also obtained from 28 California condors in captivity at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park (SDZSP) and 13 California condors in captivity at the Los Angeles Zoo. samples were obtained from 26 eagles between December 2008 and may 2009 in Kern County, California. Golden eagles were aged based on plumage and categorized as juvenile (n = 3), subadult (n = 14) or adult (n = 9). mycoplasma gallisepticum, mycoplasma synoviae, avian paramyxovirus-2, avian paramyxovirus-3, and avian reovirus were performed at Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory (College Station, TX) exposure to avian adenovirus was evaluated using an agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) test. serological testing for toxoplasma gondii was performed at university of California, Davis. a titer of 1:32 or greater was considered positive. sera from free-flying condors were also screened for active WNV infection. representative cases were selected for analysis based on availability of frozen tissues at San Diego Zoo Safari Park and degree of autolysis. DNA from tissues was extracted using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. RNA was also extracted from the lung tissue samples using the QIAamp cador Pathogen Mini kit. west Nile virus serostatus among free-flying condors was evaluated for associations with sex, age (years), rearing site, time since last vaccination. five condors had been free-flying initially and were then brought into captivity for medical treatment for various reasons including lead exposure, microtrash, or injury. six other individuals had insufficient sample volume for WNV serology. all free-flying condors were seronegative for IBV, M. gallisepticum, AVPM-1, AVPM-3, and avian reovirus. all free-flying condors were seronegative for avian adenovirus, 17% (4/24) for C. psittaci, 15% (4/26) for T. gondii. tures were seronegative for IBV, M. gallisepticum, M. synoviae, AVPM-2, AVPM-3 and avian reovirus. age and sex distributions did not differ among the three free-flying condor release locations. /32 (28%; 21\u201340%) 25/38 (66%; 52\u201373%) 38/85 (45%; 35\u201355%) Infectious Bronchitis Virus (Mass)* 0/16 (0%; 0\u201319%) 8/31 (26%; 20\u201337%) 18/35 (51%; 40\u201363%) 26/82 (32%; 23\u201342%) Mycoplasma gallisepticum 0/16 (0%; 0\u201319%) 1/34 (3%; 3\u201313%) golden eagles and turkey vultures number positive/number tested(%; 95% CI) number positive/number tested(%; 95% CI) Avian adenovirus * 19/25 (76%; 57\u201389) 26/62 (42%; 30\u201354) toxoplasma gondii 4/26 (15%; 6\u201334) 7/66 (11%; 5\u201320) west Nile virus 0/26 (0%; 0\u201313) 6/66 (9%; 4\u201318) CI = confidence interval * A significant difference between species was found. condors released in southern California also had a higher seroprevalence of IBV-Mass (51%, 18/35), compared to those released in Pinnacles National Park (0%, free-fly condors also showed a significantly higher seroprevalence of APMV-2. a higher seroprevalence of C. psittaci was found in both golden eagles and golden eagles. the SDZSP condors also had a higher seroprevalence of AVPM-2 and M. gallisepticum compared to free-flying condors. the seroprevalence of C. psittaci was significantly lower in LAZ condors compared to free-flying condors. age was significantly associated with WNV serostatus in both the Big Sur and Southern California condors. time since vaccination was also associated with WNV serostatus in all condors. age and time since vaccination were not statistically significant. free-flying condors had a seroprevalence of 32% (29/92) for avian adenovirus, 9% (7/81) for IBV-Ark, 45% (38/85) for IBV-Conn, 32% (26/82) for IBV-Mass, 1% (1/92) for M. gallisepticum, 26% (22/86) for AVPM-2, and 3% (3/92) for T. gondii all eagles were seronegative for avian adenovirus, 17% (4/24) for C. psittaci, and 15% (4/26) for T. gondii. all turkey vultures had a seroprevalence of 42% (26/62) for avian adenovirus, 9% (4/43) for AVPM-1, 11% (7/66) for T. gondii, and 9% (6/66) for WNV Avian adenovirus 4/16 (25%; 10\u201350%) 13/34 (38%; 29\u201350%) 12/42 (29%; 22\u201338%) 29/92 (32%; 23\u201342%) Chlamydophila psittaci 0/16 (0%; 0\u201319%) 0/34 (0%; 0\u201310%) 0/42 (0%; 0\u201320%) 0/92 (0%; 0\u20138%) 0/92 (0%; 6%; 27\u201348%) 7/39 (18%; 14\u201327%) 22/86 (26%; 18\u201336%) Paramyxovirus-3 0/16 (0%; 0\u201319%) 0/32 (0%; 0\u201311%) 0/83 (0%; 0\u201310%) 0/34 (0%; 0\u201310%) 0/42 (0%; 0\u20138%) 0/92 (0%; 0\u20139%) nchitis Virus (Mass) 0/25 (0%; 0\u201313) 0/56 (0%; 0\u20136) Mycoplasma synoviae 0/15 (0%; 0\u201320) 0/35 (0%; 0\u201310) Paramyxovirus-1 0/25 (0%; 0\u201313) 0/46 (0%; 0\u20138) Avian Reovirus 0/12 (0%; 0\u201324) 0/21 (0% the seroprevalence to IBV-Mass was significantly higher in condors from Big Sur compared to Pinnacles National Park. free-flying condors also showed a significantly higher seroprevalence of APMV-2 than turkey vultures (P 0.001) and golden eagles (P = 0.003) condors housed at the LAZ had a seroprevalence of 14% (2/13) for C. psittaci, IBV-Conn, M. synoviae, AVPM-1, AVPM-3, avian reovirus and T. gondii. condor tissue samples were negative by PCR for adenovirus, coronavirus, paramyxovirus and Mycoplasma s. free-flying condors, eagles, and turkey vultures Exposure to several different potential pathogens was found in all three scavenging bird species. the seroprevalence of WNV was 61% (55/90) in free-flying condors. all turkey vultures were seronegative for IBV, M. gallisepticum, M. synoviae, AVPM-2, AVPM-3 and avian reovirus. age and sex distributions did not differ among the three free-flying condor release locations.
