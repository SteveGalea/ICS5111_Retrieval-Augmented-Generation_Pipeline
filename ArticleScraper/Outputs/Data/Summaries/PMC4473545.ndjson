{"summary": "six hCoV strains have been identified to date and belong to four different groups. hCoVs are usually associated with mild to moderate respiratory tract illnesses. they can also cause severe and highly lethal disease, depending on the virus strain. human aminopeptidase N (CD13) is the cellular receptor determinant for hCoV-229E (9). hCoV-NL63 and SARS-CoV both employ human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to mediate cellular entry (11, 12), while hCoV-NL63 utilizes heparan sulfate proteoglycans for attachment to target cells. the hCoV-HKU1 HE protein mediated viral attachment by utilizing O-acetylated sialic acids on glycoprotein(s) as a receptor determinant or as initial attachment factors. the hCoV-HKU1 HE protein mediated viral attachment by utilizing O-acetylated sialic acids on glycoprotein(s) as a receptor determinant. hCoV-HKU1 acted as a sialate-9-O-acetylesterase RDE. hCoV-HKU1 employs sialic acids as a primary receptor determinant or attachment factor. hCoV-HKU1 also requires additional receptor determinants. proteins, including the NT domain of HKU1-S1 (aa 15 to 268), the NT domain of hCoV-OC43-S1 (aa 15 to 268), and the NT domain of S1 of CoV-HKU3 (aa 16 to 323) were constructed. the extracellular domains of HE proteins from different CoVs, including HKU1-HE (aa 14 to 358; GenBank accession no. NC_006577.2) cells were washed three times with FACS buffer followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled anti-mouse Fc antibody. binding of proteins to cells was analyzed by the use of a BD FACS LSRII (Becton Dickinson) flow cytometer and FCS Express software (De Novo Software) cells were washed three times and incubated with 5 g/ml Hoechst 33258 at 37\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by three additional washes. cells were then incubated with 5 g/ml FM-4-64 on ice for 1 min. the binding of S1 proteins to bovine submaxillary mucin was determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) the wells were washed with washing buffer (PBST, 0.05% Tween 20\u2013PBS] and treated with blocking buffer. an unrelated protein was used as a control in the enzymatic assay. an unrelated protein was used as a control in the enzymatic assay. the OD405 for HE protein or mutants was subtracted from that of this control. the unbound virus was removed by washing with 500 l for 10 min at 32\u00b0C for three washes. the apical sample was harvested for RNA isolation after 10 min of incubation. the RNA was then analyzed by real-time reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR. hCoV-OC43-HE protein (aa 19 to 376; GenBank accession no. NC_006577.2), hCoV-OC43-HE protein (aa 19 to 377; AAA92991.1), and MHV-S-HE (aa 25 to 393; AAX08110.1) were similarly constructed. cells were washed three times with FACS buffer followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled anti-mouse Fc antibody at a dilution. binding of proteins to cells was analyzed by the use of a BD FACS LSRII (Becton Dickinson) flow cytometer and FCS Express software (De Novo Software) cells were washed three times and then incubated with 5 g/ml Hoechst 33258 at 37\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by three additional washes. cells were analyzed and imaged with a 63 oil objective using an Zeiss LSM510 Meta confocal microscope. serially diluted S1 proteins were prepared in blocking buffer (starting concentration, 20 g/ml) and then added to the BSM-coated wells at 100 l/well. incubation was continued for 1 h followed by washing with PBST. an amplex red neuraminidase assay kit was used to measure NA activity. the fetuin substrate was serially diluted 100-fold from 2.5 mg/ml to 2.5 pg/ml. the mixture was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 10 min under dark conditions. apical sample was harvested for RNA isolation after 10 min of incubation at 32\u00b0C. RNA was then analyzed by real-time reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR to determine viral genomic mRNA copy numbers (20). RESULTS S1 domain of hCoV-HKU1 binds to RD cells. RD cells showed specific strong binding with 5 g/ml of HKU1-S1(600)-mFc. no specific binding was found for any of the other cell lines tested. a cellular attachment factor or receptor is present on the surface of the RD cells. the NT domain did not bind to RD cells even at a high concentration of 10 g/ml. the binding activity was weaker than that of HKU1-S1(600) to RD cells. the binding activity was weaker than that of HKU1-S1(600) to RD cells. FITC-labeled anti-mouse antibody detected the HKU1-S1 staining. st dye 33258 (blue) showed the binding of HKU1-S1(600)-mFc to RD cells in a dose-dependent manner in a FACS analysis. RD cells were pretreated with TPCK-trypsin protease and then inoculated with 5 g/ml of HKU1-S1(600)-mFc. a control protein, signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRP), binding to RD cells via its protein receptor, CD47 (32), was not affected by NA treatment. this result indicated that cell surface sialic acids participated in the binding of HKU1-S1(600) protein to RD cells stained with TPCK-treated trypsin reduced binding to RP-mFc. OC43-S1(268)-mFc served as a positive control. OC43-S1(268)-mFc served as a positive control. hCoV-OC43 and influenza C viruses use 9-O-Ac-Sia for attachment. both viruses have hemagglutination (HA) activity specific for rat and mouse RBCs. hCoV-OC43 and influenza C viruses use 9-O-Ac-Sia for attachment. sia-O-acetyl-esterase and NAs are two types of viral RDEs identified so far. no function for HKU1-HE during infection has been demonstrated. hCoV-OC43, BCoV, and porcine toroviruses are also present. pretreatment of RD cells with HKU1-HE dramatically reduced binding of S1 to RD cells in a dose-dependent manner. this indicates that the HKU1-HE serves as a RDE for hCoV-HKU1, possessing enzymatic activities capable of cleaving off the binding determinants for the S protein of HKU1 from the surface of the host cell. we then expressed OC43-HE, BCoV-HE, and MHV-S- HKU1-HE is an O-acetylesterase and RDE for HKU1-S1 binding to RD cells. all proteins were expressed in 293T cells and purified by the use of protein A Sepharose beads. purified proteins were run on SDS-PAGE and stained by the use of Coomassie blue. g/ml were used to hydrolyze pNPA (2-fold serially diluted) at room temperature for 15 min. the Km and Vmax values were calculated from the Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics curve fitting of two independent repeats. as expected, HKU1-HE had no detectable NA activity. hemagglutinin-esterase fusion protein (HEF) of hCoV-OC43, BCoV, MHV, and toroviruses revealed that the conserved sialate-O-acetylesterase catalytically active sites are also present in the HE protein of HKU1. hemagglutinin-esterase fusion protein (HEF) of influenza C virus and the HEs of hCoV-OC43, the acetyl modification at the 9-O position of sialic acid is a necessary but not sufficient binding determinant for HKU1-S protein. the protein possesses sialate-9-O-acetylesterase activity or even broader sialate-O-acetylesterase activity. ml were incubated with serially diluted pNPA at room temperature for 15 min. each data point represents the OD405 value for HE or its mutants subtracted from that of a negative control. RD cells were treated with 10 g/ml of HE or HE mutant proteins prior to HKU1-S1 staining (5 g/ml) no cell line has been found to be permissive for hCoV-HKU1 infection. no cell line has been found to be permissive for hCoV-HKU1 infection. hCoV-HKU1-HE protein at 100 g/ml blocked replication in HAE cells. enzymatically inactive HE variant, HKU1-HE-S40A, showed no inhibition activity. hCoV-HKU1 uses O-acetylated sialic acids as an attachment factor. only RD cells showed specific strong binding with 5 g/ml of HKU1-S1(600)-mFc compared with the control protein. we incubated cells with either HKU1-S1(600) or HKU3-S1(323) followed by fluorescently labeled secondary antibody and then used FM-4-64. no HKU3-S1(323) could be detected on the surface of the cells. binding was detected at a low concentration of HKU1-S1(600)-mFc protein at 0.61 g/ml. the NT domain did not bind to RD cells even at a high concentration of 10 g/ml. the binding activity was weaker than that of HKU1-S1(600) to RD cells. RD cells stained by HKU1-S1(600)-mFc or the control protein, HKU3-323-mFc, are shown. cell membranes were stained with FM-4-64 (red), the nuclei were stained with Hoechst dye 33258 (blue), and the HKU1-S1 staining was detected by an FITC-labeled anti-mouse Fc antibody. RD cells were pretreated with TPCK-trypsin protease and then inoculated with 5 g/ml of HKU1-S1(600)-mFc. pretreatment with NA at concentrations ranging from 20 to 500 mU/ml markedly reduced the binding of HKU1-S1(600) to RD cells in a dose-dependent manner. RD cells were pretreated with NA at different concentrations as indicated. RD cells were stained with 5 g/ml of HKU1-S1(600)-mFc, OC43 (268)-mFc, or SIRP-mFc control protein followed by detection with an FITC-labeled anti-mouse Fc antibody. the FACS assay method was similar to that described for panel A. bovine submaxillary mucin (BSM) contains 9-O-Ac-Sia and 8,9-di-O-Ac-Sia. hCoV-OC43 and influenza C viruses use 9-O-Ac-Sia for attachment. hCoV-OC43 and influenza C viruses use 9-O-Ac-Sia for attachment. the presence of 9-O-Ac-Sia alone at least is not sufficient to mediate entry for hCoV-HKU1. the HE protein of HKU1 was predicted to have a hemagglutinin domain and a putative Sia-O-acetyl-esterase active site (15) however, there is only 50% to 57% amino acid conservation between the HKU1-HE and those of other group 2a coVs. was incubated with RD cells, no direct binding was detected. this result suggests that HKU1-HE is unlikely to mediate viral attachment. RD cells were pretreated with HKU1-HE-mFc protein and then incubated with HKU1-S1(600)-mFc followed by FACS analysis to determine how much HKU1-S1(600) could still bind to RD cells. HKU1-HE is an O-acetylesterase and RDE for HKU1-S1 binding to RD cells. MHV-S-HE showed no effect on binding of either HKU1-S1 or OC43-S1. HKU1-, OC43-, or BCoV-HE inhibited OC43-S1-mediated hemagglutination activity, whereas MHV-S-HE had no effect. HEs of HKU1, OC43, BCoV, and MHV-S were used to hydrolyze pNPA (2-fold serially diluted) at room temperature for 15 min. lesterase activity showed stronger acetylesterase activity than HKU1-HE. a Km value of 1.20 0.06 mM and a Vmax value of 3.32 0.00 for OC43-HE, a Km of 1.50 0.09 mM and a Vmax of 3.42 0.04 for BCoV-HE, and a Km of 1.25 0.01 mM and a Vmax of 3.34 0.04 for MHV-S-HE both HE mutants completely lost esterase activity. this result suggests that HKU1-S1 binding required a specific type(s) of O-acetylated sialic acid to be present on the cell surface. this corresponds to the sialic acid acetylesterase specificity of the HKU1-HE. HE proteins of MHV-S, bovine torovirus (BToV) and porcine torovirus (PToV) strain p10 are enzymatically inactive. each data point represents the OD405 value for HE or its mutants subtracted from that of a negative control. the dotted line indicates the detection limit for panel D and E. HKU1-HE inhibited hCoV-HKU1 infection in tracheobronchial HAE cultures via its RDE activity. previous attempts to culture clinical isolates of HKU1 in RD cells also failed. no cell line has been found to be permissive for hCoV-HKU1 infection. NA pretreatment and HKU1-HE pretreatment of HAE cells markedly inhibited hCoV-HKU1 infection. HKU1-HE protein at 100 g/ml completely blocked hCoV-HKU1 replication in HAE cells. enzymatically inactive HE variant, HKU1-HE-S40A, showed no inhibition activity. the 9-O-Ac-Sia serves as a receptor determinant for several members of group 2a CoVs, including the closely related BCoV, hCoV-OC43, and porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus. the binding with 9-O-Ac-Sia is essential for these viruses to initiate infection. hCoV-OC43 HE lost its Sia binding activity although it has high sequence identity with the HE of BCoV (Mebus stain), which exhibits high sialate-O-acetylesterase activity. hCoV-OC43 HE lost its Sia binding activity although it has high sequence identity with the HE of BCoV (Mebus stain) the HE of hCoV-HKU1 failed to hemagglutinate erythrocytes and bind to O-Ac-Sia. the HE of hCoV-HKU1 failed to hemagglutinate erythrocytes and bind to O-Ac-Sia. a synthetic 4,9-di-O-Ac-Sia substrate analogue showed sia-9-O-Ac-esterase activity similar to that seen with OC43-HE and BCoV-HE. the results strongly support the idea that HKU1-HE has sia-9-O-Ac-esterase activity similar to that seen with OC43-HE and BCoV-HE. acetyl modification at 9-O of sialic acid may be a necessary but not sufficient receptor or attachment factor determinant. hCoV-HKU1 is similar to BCoV and hCoV-OC43, employing its two surface proteins to complete the viral infection cycle in a concerted manner."}
