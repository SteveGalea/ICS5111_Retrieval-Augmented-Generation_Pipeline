{"summary": "interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) are a family of highly related proteins characterized by the presence of two hydrophobic transmembrane domains (TM1 and TM2) separated by a conserved intracellular loop (CIL) and variable N- and C-terminal domains (NTD and CTD, respectively) in humans, this family is composed of five expressed members (IFITM1, -2, -3, -5, and -10), three of virions produced in the presence of IFITMs exhibit impaired ability to undergo fusion with cellular membranes. virions produced in the presence of IFITMs exhibit an impaired ability to undergo fusion with cellular membranes, the same step that hinders fusion between the membranes of incoming virions. a panel of 16 different mutants spanning the entire length of IFITM3 against HIV-1 analyzed the behavior of a group of 16 different mutants. this included their incorporation into virions, their stability, their reported ability to increase the levels of formation of CD63-positive vesicles and multivesicular bodies (MVBs) in the cell, as well as their ability to affect cholesterol levels. a new gain-of-function IFITM3 mutant and the second located in the CTD may represent a region involved in the differential regulation of the two antiviral properties ascribed to IFITM3 against HIV-1. we took advantage of a collection of mutants spanning the entire length of IFITM3 (6 amino acids changed to alanines per mutant, named by the number of the first and last substituted residues) IFITM3 mutants were expressed transiently at levels comparable to those observed in primary dendritic cells stimulated with interferon alpha (IFN-) cells were cotransfected with DNAs encoding the variants, the NL4-3 proviral clone, and a miniviral HIV-1-based genome bearing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter and a self-inactivating long terminal repeat. all IFITM3 mutants were detectable in cell lysates. the structural viral proteins Gag p55 and Env gp160 were also detected at similar levels. the amounts of virion particles produced under different conditions varied little in comparison to the control. mutant 19-24 was the sole mutant whose detection required hybridization with a distinct anti-IFITM3 antibody compared to the remaining mutants. all mutants displayed statistically significant differences over the control according to the same test. all IFITM3 mutants copurified with HIV-1 virions. none of the mutations analyzed here prevented the incorporation of IFITM3 into HIV-1 virions. all mutants tested exerted measurable and variable effects on infectivity of virion particles. two mutations that individually relieve negative imprinting properties of IFITM3 on virion particles fail to cooperatively alleviate the antiviral phenotype. the antiviral activity of the double IFITM3 mutant 73-78/109-114 was assessed as described in the legend to Fig. 2. the domains spanning residues 13 to 18 and 37 to 42 have been strictly conserved during million years of primate evolution. the region spanning residues 37 to 42 is well conserved among New and Old World monkeys. the one spanning residues 13 to 18 has undergone more-drastic diversification. mutagenesis study failed to reveal a single mutation that completely abrogated the ability of IFITM3 to be incorporated into virion particles. several mutations were identified that decreased the absolute levels of IFITM3 molecules incorporated into normalized amounts of virion particles. the levels of incorporation of IFITM3 into virions do not correlate with their ability to negatively affect HIV-1 virion infectivity. we used our results to determine whether the physical presence of IFITM3 in virion particles is instrumental for their ability to decrease virion infectivity. the results indicate no correlation between incorporation levels of IFITM3 and the potency of the antiviral phenotype. the ability of IFITM3 to decrease virion particle infectivity does not correlate with the accumulation of CD63-positive vesicles in cells. however, it is unclear whether this observation is functionally linked to the antiviral functions of IFITM3. IFITM3 mutants modulate the extent of accumulation of CD63-positive vesicles as well as MVBs in cells. this phenotype does not directly relate to the ability of IFITM3 to decrease virion particle infectivity. IFITM3 does not affect cholesterol levels in cells or in purified virion particles. cells treated with either methyl--cyclodextrin (1 mM) or oleic acid (100 M) showed low to undetectable and increased intracellular cholesterol levels. the infectivity defect of virion particles produced in the presence of IFITM3 is unlikely to affect cholesterol homeostasis in the cells tested in this study. however, they do not exclude the possibility that the infectivity defect of virion particles produced in the presence of IFITM3 could be due to a specific enrichment of cholesterol in virion membranes. the virion preparations were normalized by either exo-RT activity or total lipid contents. CD4 and CXCR4 were used as targets for viral challenge. extent of infection was measured 2 to 3 days later by flow cytometry. susceptibility of cells expressing the different IFITM3 mutants varied from 85 to 15%. the panels present typical results obtained, while the graph presents averages and SEM obtained from 5 to 7 independent experiments. all mutants display P values of 0.05 when the same test is carried out in comparison to control cells. these two IFITM3 mutants are less stable than the WT. this would suggest that target cell protection is more sensitive than negative imprinting to the intracellular levels of IFITM3. this parameter does not simply explain the protein\u2019s phenotypes. several of the IFITM3 mutants were found to exhibit a more peripheral (mutants 8-13 and 19-24) or a more internal (mutants 79-84, 85-90, 103-108, 115-120, and 127-132) distribution than the wild type (WT) IFITM3 mutants were expressed transiently at levels comparable to those observed in primary dendritic cells stimulated with interferon alpha (IFN-) cells were cotransfected with DNAs encoding the IFITM3 variants, the NL4-3 proviral clone, and a miniviral HIV-1-based genome bearing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter and a self-inactivating long terminal repeat (LTR) p160 were also detected at similar levels, although small variations could be observed across experiments. no major variations were observed in the levels of mature Env gp120 incorporated in virions produced in the presence of the different IFITM3 mutants. the expression of WT IFITM3 had been previously associated with the loss of mature Env incorporation in HIV (37) mutant 19-24 was the sole mutant whose detection required hybridization with a distinct anti-IFITM3 antibody compared to the remaining mutants. all IFITM3 mutants copurified with HIV-1 virions, although to widely different extents. type IFITM3 resulted in a 55% decrease in infectivity in single-round infection assays. all IFITM3 mutants tested exerted measurable and variable effects on the infectivity of virion particles with respect to the control. the 19-24 and 85-90 IFITM3 mutants imparted greater infectivity defects (70% and 85% lower infectivity than the control, respectively) several conserved domains in IFITM3 influence the protein\u2019s stability. mutations led to a statistically significant decrease in the accumulation of IFITM3 in the cell. region spanning residues 37 to 42 is well conserved among New and Old World monkeys. one spanning residues 13 to 18 has undergone more-drastic diversification. evolutionary conservation of domains influencing IFITM3 levels. mutagenesis study failed to reveal a single mutation that completely abrogated the ability of IFITM3 to be incorporated into virion particles. however, several mutations were identified that decreased the absolute levels of IFITM3 molecules incorporated into normalized amounts of virion particles. we compared levels of accumulation of different IFITM3 mutants in cells and in purified virions. the levels of incorporation of IFITM3 into virions do not correlate with their ability to negatively affect HIV-1 virion infectivity. we used our results to determine the possible existence of a correlation between incorporation levels of IFITM3 and the potency of the antiviral phenotype. this suggests that the incorporation of IFITM3 into HIV-1 particles is not sufficient for the negative imprinting phenotype. the expression of WT IFITM3 was clearly accompanied by an increase in the proportion of CD63-positive cells (from 35% to 70%) it is unclear whether this observation is functionally linked to the antiviral functions of IFITM3. cells expressing or not expressing a short list of IFITM3 mutants were analyzed by confocal microscopy using the endosomal marker CD63. the graphs present data obtained in 2 independent experiments (electron microscopy) or 3 independent experiments (immunofluorescence analysis) with over 100 scored cells under each condition. hek293T cells were analyzed by confocal fluorescence microscopy. hek293T cells were treated with either methyl-cyclodextrin (1 mM) or oleic acid (100 M), well known to either deplete or increase the intracellular levels of cholesterol. rion preparations were normalized by either exo-RT activity or total lipid contents. this purification procedure cannot separate bona fide virion particles from exosomal vesicles. however, the extent of cholesterol modification for the different mutants was not explored further. the susceptibility of cells expressing the different IFITM3 mutants varied from 85 to 15%. only two mutants significantly relieved the antiviral properties of IFITM3 compared to the wild type, mutant 13-18 and mutant 37-42. the partial loss of the antiviral activity of these mutants may be related to their lower expression levels than the WT. correlative analysis between the extent of incorporation of the different IFITM3 mutants into virion particles and their levels of expression in cells. the effects of individual mutations on these parameters were normalized to those of the WT and compared. mutants 85-90 and 127-132 display a divergent behavior. this may support a model in which two distinct antiviral mechanisms are at play. the behavior of mutant 127-132 may suggest that this region differentially regulates target cell protection and negative imprinting of virions. mutants 13-18 and 37-42 in the NTD; 73-78 in TM1; and 79-84, 85-90, and 103-108 in the CIL. mutant 13-18 (13NSGGQPP18) is not unexpected, as it overlaps a region that acts as a docking site for several proteins. mutations in the CIL are of high interest because this region is extremely conserved among members of the IFITM family. genous IFITM3 mutants in primary macrophages undergoing spreading HIV-1 infection did not have a major influence. differences in localization of IFITM3 mutants did not have a major influence, in line with similar findings for IFITM1, -2, and -3, which were equally well incorporated into virion particles. the absence of a correlation between the antiviral activities of several IFITM3 mutants and their degree of incorporation into particles. a previous observation from our laboratory indicating that IFITM1 can decrease the infectivity of dugbe virus (a member of the Bunyaviridae family) without being detectably incorporated into virion particles. two regions in the NTD are important for the antiviral effects of IFITM3 against HIV-1 during target cell protection. these regions do not play major roles in the case of influenza A virus (IAV) and dengue virus (DENV), viruses that are instead influenced by nonoverlapping regions in the NTD as well as by mutations in TM1 and the CIL (19). mutant 85-90 in the CIL represents a gain-of-function mutant that interferes with the trafficking and/or incorporation of HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins into virions. mutant 127-132 presents wild-type behavior with respect to virion particle infectivity but is less active during target cell protection. a previous study identified regions of IFITM3 that strongly influenced protein stability. mutants 13-18 and 37-42 in the NTD, 73-78 in TM1 and 79-84, 85-90, and 103-108 in the CIL. mutant 13-18 (13NSGGQPP18) overlaps a region that acts as a docking site for several proteins. a single 6-amino-acid-stretch mutation capable of excluding IFITM3 from virions did not reveal a single mutation capable of excluding IFITM3 from virions. the comparison between IFITM3 levels in cells and in virions allowed us to appreciate that the main driver of the incorporation of mutant into virion particles seems to be their degree of expression. we have not identified a single IFITM3 mutant completely excluded from HIV-1 virions. either very low levels of IFITM3 are sufficient to impart a negative effect on virion infectivity or the physical presence of IFITM3 in virion particles is not important for the antiviral phenotype. two regions in the NTD (spanning residues 13 to 18 and 37 to 42) are important for the antiviral effects of IFITM3 against HIV-1 during target cell protection. these regions do not play major roles in the case of influenza A virus (IAV) and dengue virus (DENV) we have obtained four modulatory regions in IFITM3. two regions in TM1 and TM2 (residues 73 to 78 and 109 to 114) that relieve infectivity defect. two in the NTD and CIL that interestingly increase it (residues 19 to 24 and 85 to 90) the 85-90 mutant should be considered to have a gain-of-function phenotype. this mechanism would affect more deeply the infectivity of newly produced virion particles rather than target cell protection. mutant 127-132 presents wild-type behavior with respect to virion particle infectivity. double mutants were engineered in the same backbone using standard molecular biology techniques. IFITM3 variants are expressed in the context of the QCXIP vector (Clontech) quantification of the different proteins analyzed here was carried out after densitometric analysis of results obtained after WB. for IFITM3 mutants expressed at low levels, quantifications were carried out on overexpressed signals. pilot comparative experiments were carried out with digital-fluorescence-based WB quantification. we had previously determined that these concentrations were comparable to those measured in primary dendritic cells stimulated with type I interferons. forty-eight hours after DNA transfection, cells were lysed, supernatants were filtered through a 0.45-m syringe filter, and virions were purified by ultracentrifugation at 28,000 rpm for 75 min. cells were incubated with primary antibodies overnight, followed by incubation for 2 h with a donkey anti-rabbit IgG\u2013Alexa Fluor 594 conjugate. a 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)-containing mounting medium was used (Southern Biotech) images were acquired using a spectral Zeiss LSM710 confocal microscope and analyzed with Fiji software. sections were stained with 2% uranyl acetate and 5% lead citrate. phylogenetic analyses of the primate IFITM1 to -3 genes were retrieved from publicly available databases. IFITM3 variants are expressed in the context of the QCXIP vector (Clontech) in the absence of any epitope tag. double mutants were engineered in same backbone using standard molecular biology techniques. Nile Red, methyl-cyclodextrin (MCD) and oleic acid (OA) were purchased from Sigma. the 19-24 mutant did not cross-react with the anti-NTD antibody. quantification of the different proteins analyzed here was carried out after densitometric analysis of results obtained after WB. virion particles were produced by calcium phosphate DNA transfection of HEK293T cells in the presence of different IFITM3 mutants or control DNAs with a DNA ratio of 8:4:3 for NL4-3, pRRL-CMV-GFP, and IFITM3 respectively. virions were then purified by ultracentrifugation at 28,000 rpm for 75 min through a 25% (wt/vol) sucrose cushion. lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used according to manufacturer's instructions. cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, quenched with 50 mM NH4Cl for 10 min, and permeabilized with PBS\u20130.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min. images were acquired using a spectral Zeiss LSM710 confocal microscope. the impregnation step was performed with a mixture (1:1) of propylene oxide-Epon resin. cells were then embedded in Epon resin, which was allowed to polymerize for 48 h at 60\u00b0C. phylogenetic analyses of the primate IFITM1 to -3 genes in primates challenging (41) relevant data are within the paper."}
