{"summary": "EV-G, enterovirus G, FMDv, Foot-and-mouth disease virus, PLpro, papain-like cysteine protease, qPCR, quantitative PCR. qPCR, quantitative PCR has greatly enhanced our ability to identify unknown pathogens in a variety of sample types. us Enterovirus comprises 12 species (enterovirus A\u2013H and J, and rhinovirus A\u2013C). the two most common genotypes are EV-G1 (previously called porcine enterovirus 9) and EV-G2 (previously called porcine enterovirus 10). a nursery in central Texas containing 21\u201355 day-old piglets was experiencing an outbreak of diarrhoea. two faecal samples were tested for common viral pathogens by qPCR or bacterial culturing. the samples were processed for NGS on the Illumina Miseq. a majority of reads in each sample were either host (2\u201337 %) or bacterial (49\u201358 %), and only 2.1\u20133.5 % of the reads were classified as viral. EV-G was the only virus detected, excluding bacteriophages. taxon-specific reads (EV-G) were isolated and de novo assembled with the Iterative Virus Assembler (iva) v1.0.6 [20], and the genomes were manually verified by remapping all sample reads using Bowtie2 v2.2.4 [21]. each EV-G genome exhibited a mean coverage of 118and 170 (min/max: 42/231 and 58/316), respectively. the two Texas strains are highlighted in blue, and dots represent identical positions. sequence alignment of 223 aa Texas insertion and Torovirus strains reveals a core 173 aa region of considerable conservation. insertion sequence exhibited only 80 and 70 % nt identities (89 and 88 % aa identities) with the RefSeq EV-G strain UKG/410/73 (NC_004441) the Texas strains only exhibited 77 % nt identity with the only other USA EV-G strain USA/13-03212/2013 (KF985175.1), illustrating the substantial EV-G diversity between the current complete genomes. the PLpro of other coronaviruses (e.g. SARS-CoV) are known to hydrolyse poly-ubiquitin chains, which may prevent degradation of viral proteins by the host proteasome. the function of the PLpro insertion in the Texas strains, and its contribution to viral replication, transmission and pathogenesis are still unknown. a blastn search was run using the Texas strains as the query sequence. the blastn hits were translated and aligned with muscle v3.8.31 [25], revealing a core set of 173 aa conserved across all samples. this alignment showed multiple regions of perfect conservation, suggesting that the protease active sites are retained. the 14 currently available EV-G genomes from GenBank (with VP1-based genotypes: 1\u20136, 8\u201310) were identified from swine in the UK, Belgium, China, Hungary, Vietnam, South Korea and the USA [9, 13, 27\u201333] phylogenetic relationships between all genomes were explored by aligning nucleotide sequences and creating phylogenetic trees (as described above) a larger sampling of full-length EV-G genomes will reveal the global prevalence and provide evolutionary insights for this novel sequence. a larger sampling of full-length EV-G genomes will reveal the global prevalence and provide evolutionary insights for this novel sequence. the strain names are followed by GenBank accession numbers and genotypes. the branch lengths between taxa are based on the mean number of nucleotide substitutions per site and bipartitions are labelled with bootstrapping support values."}
