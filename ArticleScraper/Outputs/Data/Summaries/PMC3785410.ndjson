{"summary": "more than 2 million children under 5 are killed by pneumonia every year worldwide. etiology of CAP is critical for defining proper treatment and preventive measures. many studies have been conducted to investigate bacterial etiology of CAP. %-45% of cases of the disease are still caused by unknown pathogens. multiplex PCRs have been developed and optimized to be performed on lower respiratory tract samples. new information on the incidence of atypical pathogens and of pathogens in cases of severe CAP and in CAP in the elderly. the viruses targeted by the RPM-IVDC1 assay are identified in Material S1, consisting of 9 influenza A subtypes, 11 rhinoviruses, 28 enteroviruses and 38 other viruses. a total of 110 patients (62 of whom were male) meeting the criteria, aged from 1 month to 96 years old, were enrolled. purified nucleic acid was frozen at -80\u00b0C in 15-l aliquots. internal controls were chosen for reverse transcription (RT) and multiplex PCR. DNA was obtained from 10-day plantlet. RT reactions were performed in 20-l volume containing 500M each dATP, dTTP, dGTP and dCTP, 50ng of random hexamers, 1x RT buffer, 5mM MgCl2, 10mM DTT, 40U of RNaseOUT, 200U of SuperScript III. a 2-l aliquot of RT product was subject to each of the four different multiplex PCRs. primer mix B contained 36 primer pairs corresponding to 32 target genes of 5 influenza A subtypes, eight RV serotypes, three PIV types, coV-OC43 and one internal control (NAC1-1) PCRs were performed in 25-l volumes containing 1x QIAGEN Multiplex PCR Master Mix (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany), 500 nM primer UTS, 50 nM each primer from each primer mix, 1,000 copies of cloned plasm 10 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30s, 55\u00b0C for 90s, 72\u00b0C for 75s. 30 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30s, 50\u00b0C for 90s, 72\u00b0C for 75s. hybridization was performed at 49\u00b0C for 16h. images were scanned and processed as previously described. a panel of six samples with different numbers of copies (1000, 500, 200, 100, 50 and 10) for each of the 16 organisms was prepared. each sample was tested ten times over five days. the results were analyzed by SPSS 17.0 (IBM Corp.) to calculate the analytical sensitivity. assay data analysis software evaluates a \"C3 Score\" for each RPM-Flu detector tile. it is the total number of GSEQ-identified nucleotides that appear in runs of three or more consecutive (non-N) base calls. the threshold of C3 Score was increased to 50 due to shortened detector tile sequences. a standard questionnaire including demographic data, radiological result and clinical signs was filled out. the NPAs were kept at -70\u00b0C until further study. participants received information on the study\u2019s purpose and of their right to keep information confidential. the purified products were ligated to pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI) the recombinant plasmids were transformed into E. coli. 10,000 copies of in vitro transcribed TIM RNA and 1,000 copies of NAC1 plasmid were used as internal controls. random hexamers, 1x RT buffer, 5mM MgCl2, 10mM DTT, 40U of RNaseOUT, 200U of SuperScript III. a 2-l aliquot of RT product was subject to each of the four different multiplex PCRs. primer mix A contained 38 primer pairs corresponding to 38 target genes of common respiratory viruses. PCRs were performed in 25-l volumes containing 1x QIAGEN Multiplex PCR Master Mix (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany), 500 nM primer UTS, 50 nM each primer from each primer mix, and 2.5l of the RT product. the application reactions were carried out in a Px2 Thermo Cycler (Thermo Electron Corp, Vantaa, Finland) with initial incubation at 95\u00b0C for 15min to activate the a probit regression analysis was calculated by SPSS 17.0 (IBM Corp.) giving a C95 value (concentration detectable 95% of the time) of 59.5, which indicate that the limit of detection is about 60 copies/reaction and samples containing that concentration would be detected 95% of the time. specificity of the assay was investigated with previously confirmed positive specimens infected with 16 common respiratory virus types/subtypes. clinical samples were used to compare utility of the microarray-based diagnostic to a geXP-based multiplex RT-PCR assay of respiratory virus detection. the samples were selected randomly without any test for respiratory pathogens. the lack of culture results and the concern about upper respiratory bacterium contamination make it difficult to properly identify the bacterial pathogens. a conventional PCR and sequencing was performed. results Sensitivity and Specificity were confirmed with pre-determined clinical samples. 92 (spike) RSVA RSVA (DQ780565.1) 97.5 (NP), 78.5(GP) RSVB RSVB (AF013254.1) 97 (NP), 79.5(GP) PIV1 PIV1 (M80818.1) 89 (M), 71 (HN) RV RVA 79.5 (5\u2019UTR) RV RVC 51.5 (5\u2019UTR) HBoV HBoV 94 (VP1), 87.5 ( sensitivity of the assay was evaluated using serial 10-fold dilutions of in vitro transcribed RNA or DNA clones. lowest detectable dilutions revealed an individual sensitivity ranging from 10 to 1,000 copies per reaction for 16 virus types/subtypes.

Viruses detected in 110 (age, 0.1-96 years) CAP patients by RPM-IVDC1. the detection result of RPM-IVDC1 completely coincided with the parallel reference assay. the same situation occurred in human rhinovirus detection where 17 more RVs were detected by RPM. for the group of children aged 5 years, 16 (72.7%) of 22 patients had viral infections. hMPV, human metapneumovirus; HBoV, human bocavirus. Table 8. Comparison of RPM-IVDC1 with GeXP-based PCR assay for detection of PIV2, AdV, RSVA, CoV-229E, RV, FluAa. a targeted multiplex PCR based on temperature-switch PCR (TSP) amplification technology was adopted. a commonly used multiplex PCR reagent was used. this increased assay sensitivity compared to conventional amplification strategy in samples with heavy backgrounds. resequencing array design of RPM-IVDC1 allows more coverage of respiratory viral pathogens. two main changes of the new microarray design compared to RPM-Flu3.1 were the length of the detector tiles and primers selected for amplification of the chosen targets. control strains of febrile respiratory illness (FRI)-causing pathogens (18,19) and different reference strains of influenza A virus [16] were used to assess the performance of RPM v.1 and RPM-Flu3.1. the results showed excellent specificity of the new microarray for type- or strain level identification of some reference samples. the most common etiologic agent in the adult group was RV. the most common etiologic agent in the adult group was RV. the most common etiologic agent in the adult group was RV. the presence of HHV in the throat is a highly significant and independent risk factor for the development of lower respiratory tract infections with HHV [32,34]. HHV-1, 7 HHV-4 (EBV), 1 HHV-5 (CMV), 4 HHV-6 infections were detected using the RPM method, which was later confirmed by PCR and sequencing. HHV-6 virus, which causes roseola and fever after the primary infection, was identified in three children with ages under 5 and one RSVA should be addressed prior to clinical adoption. the capability of this assay for the simultaneous detection of a broad-spectrum respiratory tract viruses should also be further validated."}
