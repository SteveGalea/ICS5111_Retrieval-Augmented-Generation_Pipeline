{"summary": "it has been difficult to eradicate the H9N2 virus because of its low pathogenicity. it is important for the control of AI to assess whether the virus acquires pathogenicity as H5 and H7 viruses. more than 75% of chickens inoculated intravenously with the virus, rgY55sub-P10, died. a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (H1 to H16 and N1 to N9) is generated when a non-pathogenic virus brought in by migratory birds from nesting lakes in the north is transmitted to chickens via domestic ducks, geese, quails, turkeys. the hemagglutinins (HAs) of HPAIVs differ from those of low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAIVs) with di-basic amino acids no specific-pathogen-free chickens experimentally infected with H9N2 isolates from diseased chickens showed any clinical symptoms. it is important for controlling avian influenza to assess whether the H9N2 virus aquires pathogenicity as H5 and H7 viruses. rgVac1ins (H5N1) was generated by inserting the RRKKR motif into the HA of the non-pathogenic virus A/duck/Hokkaido/Vac-1/2004 (Vac1) (H5N1) since recent H5 HPAIV isolates have the motif as insertion mutation. rgVac1sub (H5N1) was also generated to examine whether subtitution mutation with basic amino acid residues at the HA cleavage site contributed to y55sub (H9N2) and rgVac1ins (H5N1) replicated in MDCK cells without exogenous trypsin. one of the eight chickens inoculated with the virus showed slight depression at one day post-infection. 6 -

LPAI caused by H9N2 strains in poultry is now causing serious economic losses. yokohama/aq-55/2001 (Y55) (H9N2) isolated from chicken meat imported from china upon quarantine was provided by Dr. M. Eto, Animal Quarantine Service (Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan) [36]. viruses were propagated in ten-day-old embryonated chicken eggs for 48 hours at 35\u00b0C. confluent 293T and MDCK cells in 75 cm2 flasks were trypsinized. 10% of each cell line was mixed in 12 ml of Opti-MEM I. transfection mixture was replaced with Opti-MEM I after six hours of incubation. gVac1sub (H5N1), rgVac1ins (H5N1), and rgVac1ins (H5N1) were rescued by reverse genetics. the entire genomes of the eight gene segments were sequenced to confirm the existence of the introduced mutations. unbound viruses were removed by washing the cells with MEM. cells were then overlaid with MEM containing 0.7% Bacto-agar. eight chickens were intravenously inoculated with 200 l of each virus (1:10 diluted allantoic fluid) three chickens were infected intranasally with 100 l of allantoic fluid containing each virus at an EID50 of 106.5. each virus was inoculated into three chickens at an EID50 of 106.5. Viruses were propagated in ten-day-old embryonated chicken eggs for 48 hours at 35\u00b0C. the complete nucleotide sequences of Y55 (H9N2) and Vac1 (H5N1) have been registered in GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ. clones were digested with BsmBI and inserted into the vector pHW2000 [42] before transfection, confluent 293T and MDCK cells in 75 cm2 flasks were trypsinized. before transfection, confluent 293T and MDCK cells in 75 cm2 flasks were trypsinized. mutant viruses rgY55sub (H9N2), rgVac1sub (H5N1) and rgVac1ins (H5N1) were rescued by reverse genetics. the entire genomes of the eight gene segments were sequenced to confirm the existence of the introduced mutations and the absence of undesired mutations. Y55 virus were substituted with basic amino acids. the allantoic fluid was harvested and stored at -80\u00b0C. eight chickens were intravenously inoculated with 200 l of each virus. the experiments were performed according to the guidelines of the institutional animal care and use committee of the Graduate School of Veterinary Medicine.
