{"summary": "FMD is a member of the Aphthovirus genus in the Picornaviridae family. it is one of the major constraints to international trade in animal products. asymptomatic FMDV carrier animals are perceived as a threat and the existence of the carrier state complicates regaining FMD-free status. several published works have implicated the pharyngeal tissues of cattle as the predilection site for FMDV persistence [13\u201317] however, the mechanism(s) responsible for the establishment, maintenance, and resolution of the carrier state remain undetermined. lower FMDV RNA content compared to probang samples led to the conclusion that the targeted biopsy area within the DSP does not consistently harbor FMDV replication during persistent infection [22] it is well documented that FMDV subverts the early immune response particularly by targeting innate immune mechanisms. this occurs through inhibitory effects on cytokine-driven pathways resulting in impaired function of antigen presenting cells and their precursors. the current study investigated tissue-specific localization of FMDV in persistently infected cattle. none of these mechanisms have been demonstrated to represent a defining event in establishment of persistent infection. however, none of these mechanisms have been demonstrated to represent a defining event in establishment of persistent infection. all experimental subjects were 9-12 month-old Holstein steers weighing 400\u2013500 kg. animals were housed in a BSL-3Ag animal facility from time of inoculation or vaccination until time of euthanasia.

FMDV structural protein localized to multiple cells within basal layers of crypt epithelium. superficial cells containing FMDV antigen are squamous. deeper immunopositive cell is polygonal, scale bar 25 m. cells containing FMDV-VP1 are in superficial epithelium and are cytokeratin-positive. rRT-PCR, VI, rRT-PCR or by virus isolation (97.22%), with 91.66% positive for rRT-PCR, 81.48% positive for VI and 75.92% positive by both techniques. only amongst SAT2-infected animals, several probangs were found to contain infectious FMDV, but not viral RNA. tid and hilar lymph nodes, esophagus, parotid salivary gland and skin (interdigital cleft, coronary band and metacarpal skin) only the epithelium of the Dorsal Nasopharynx occupies the highest stratum of 80\u2013100% indicating this tissue as the most consistent site of FMDV persistent infection. IL-6 was the only cytokine showing increased expression amongst carriers with more than two-fold increase of relative expression. boxes represent the interquartile range, or the middle 50% of observations. nasopharyngeal epithelia were consistently intact with no evidence of erosion, ulceration or microvesiculation. epithelial segments containing FMDV antigen were typically closely associated with MALT follicles. rare single cells containing FMDV protein were localized to subepithelial lymphoid regions. for host cell antigens indicated that FMDV-positive cells were morphologically and phenotypically consistent with epithelial cells. in some tissues, cytokeratin-/MHCII+ intra-epithelial cells (presumptive DC) were in close proximity, but were never observed to contain FMDV antigen. superficial cells containing FMDV antigen are squamous. deeper immunopositive cell is polygonal, scale bar 25 m. nasopharynx, steer #626, 37dpe, FMDV O1 Manisa. retropharyngeal lymph nodes cannot be definitively concluded to be the principal sites for persistence of FMDV due to inconsistent detection of FMDV RNA in these tissues. the extent to which these differences across studies reflect variation in experimental designs, utilization of different FMDV strains, as well as different inoculation routes remains undetermined. confirmed carrier cattle indicated no histopathological lesions were present in any animal. this suggests that the interaction of virus and host in the nasopharynx during the carrier state is quite different from what occurs during acute infection. primary infection of the nasopharyngeal epithelium of carriers induces a less severe extent of an apparently similar process resulting in keratinocyte degeneration and ultimately cell loss (erosion) phenotypic profile of intra-epithelial cells containing FMDV antigens was uniformly cytokeratin (+)/ CD11c(-)/MHCII(-) this suggests that replication of FMDV occurs in epithelial cells rather than intra-epithelial dendritic cells. current data suggest that in the persistent phase of FMDV infection in cattle there is a clear lack of stimulation and a trend towards suppression of transcription of various host cytokine genes at IL-12, suppressed in the current study, has previously been shown to be inhibited by measles virus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) persistent hepatitis C virus infection has been associated with disruption of the cellular signaling pathways which lead to interferon production. however, the mechanism whereby FMDV evades the host response is still unclear. previous work describing gene expression in tissues with different FMDV tropism from non-infected cattle suggested that pharyngeal tissues are intrinsically poor IFN inducers and responders. the manners in which innate cytokine production influence pathways of cellular immunity add another level of mechanistic complexity to considering transcriptome analysis. FMDV has immunomodulatory effects at various tissues at various stages of infection. the effects were not statistically significant. there was an undeniable lack of immunostimulation which is often an expected result."}
