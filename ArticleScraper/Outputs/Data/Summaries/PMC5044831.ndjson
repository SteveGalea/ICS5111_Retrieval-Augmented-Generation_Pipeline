{"summary": "MERS-CoV is the sixth coronavirus known to cause infection in humans (8). MERS-CoV uses a unique cellular receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), for virus entry (9. the host cell receptors for a number of animal coronaviruses have also been identified. ine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) binds APN (10), and betacoronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) uses carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) for entry (11). HCoV-NL63 uses heparan sulfate proteoglycans for attachment to target cells (14) recent in vitro and in vivo studies have highlighted the extraordinarily wide range of tissue and cell tropism of MERS-CoV. the broad tissue tropism of MERS-CoV infection was in part explained by the ubiquitous cellular expression of DPP4. however, alternative factors may exist and potentiate the infection either in conjunction with or independently of DPP4. BHK21 cells were maintained in minimum essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 g/ml streptomycin. aliquots of MERS-CoV were used for plaque assays on confluent VeroE6 cells in 24-well plates. the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 h. agarose overlay was added to the cells. the cells were then incubated for approximately 72 h. the fragment was cloned into the pSFV vector with the 6His sequence fused in frame with the FLAG sequence. the fragment was PCR amplified and cloned into the pSFV vector. for the construction of the pSFV-DPP4-6His plasmid, a forward primer containing a KpnI site and a reverse primer with an ApaI site. pcDNA 3.1(+) contained the XhoI site in the cytoplasmic domain. the amplified fragment was used to generate full-length CEACAM5 in pcDNA 3.1(+) with a V5 tag (GKPIPNPLLGLDST) in frame at the C terminus, resulting in pcDNA-CEACAM5-V5. pNL4-3-R.E is an HIV backbone plasmid bearing the the biotinylated surface extracts were bound onto neutrAvidin agarose resin (Thermo Scientific, USA) after electrophoresis in a gradient nuPAGE SDS-PAGE gel. the membranes were blocked in 10% skim milk (Oxoid, UK) in PBS at 4\u00b0C overnight on a rotator. the membranes were then incubated with 1% skim milk solution containing MERS-S-pseud the gel fragment was excised for LC\u2013MS-MS analysis. cell lysates were harvested in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% NP-40, protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails. Viral RNA in the supernatant was extracted with a PureLink Viral RNA/DNA minikit (Life Technologies, USA) reverse transcription (RT) and quantitative PCR were performed with the Transcriptor First Strand cDNA synthesis kit and LightCycler 480 master mix from Roche. reverse primers against the NP gene of MERS-CoV were used to detect cDNA complementary to the positive strands of viral genomes. CAM5 at different concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 4 g/ml were included as controls. the cells were challenged with MERS-CoV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. the cells were then washed with PBS and lysed with 40 mM DTT. incubation period, inoculum was discarded and cells were washed with PBS, followed by lysing in RLT with 40 mM DTT. virus copy number was determined by qPCR. to determine virus entry, the cells were inoculated with MERS-CoV at an MOI of 5 at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. after 2 h, the cells were washed extensively with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and immunolabeled for flow cytometry. beAS2B and Calu3 cells were maintained in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 g/ml streptomycin. L929 cells were maintained in MEM supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 g/ml streptomycin. the diluted MERS-CoV stocks were serially diluted in DMEM. the cells were then incubated for approximately 72 h. the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 h and stained with crystal violet. the fragment was cloned into the pSFV-DPP4-6His plasmid. the fragment was PCR amplified and cloned into the pSFV vector. for the construction of pcDNA-DPP4, the forward primer containing a KpnI site was used. the forward primer (5\u2032GATATCCACCATGGAGTCTCTCGGCCCCCCCCCCCAC) contained the XhoI site in the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. the amplified fragment was used to generate full-length CEACAM5 in pcDNA 3.1(+) with a V5 tag. biotinylated membrane extracts were bound onto neutrAvidin agarose resin (Thermo Scientific, USA) after electrophoresis in a gradient nuPAGE SDS-PAGE gel. membranes were blocked in 10% skim milk (Oxoid, UK) in PBS overnight on a rotator. the protein contents were electroeluted at a constant voltage of 50 V for 6 h. the eluted contents were electrophoresed and confirmed by VOPBA. the gel fragment was excised for LC\u2013MS-MS analysis. membranes were lysed in RLT buffer with 40 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) cells were lysed in RLT buffer with 40 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and extracted with an RNeasy minikit. reverse primers against the NP gene of MERS-CoV were used to detect cDNA complementary to the positive strands of viral genomes. the infected cells were infected with MERS-CoV at an MOI of 0.0005 for 1 h at 37\u00b0C in the presence of antibodies. the cells were then washed in PBS and replenished with DMEM with blocking antibodies. the protein-virus complexes were incubated with the Calu3 and Huh7 cells for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. after the inoculation period, the inoculum was discarded and the cells were washed with PBS, followed by lysing in RLT with 40 mM DTT. the virus copy number was determined by qPCR. the transfected cells were transfected with pSFV-DPP4 or pcDNA-CEACAM5. the cells were inoculated with MERS-CoV at an MOI of 5 at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. after 2 h, the cells were washed extensively with PBS. RESULTS Identification of CEACAM5 as a cell surface binding protein of MERS-CoV. we used the VOPBA to identify host cell surface binding proteins of influenza A virus (26) membrane proteins on A549 cells were selectively biotinylated and separated from nonbiotinylated intracellular proteins by binding to avidin agarose (23) new tab CEACAM5 is a cell surface binding protein of MERS-CoV. a549 and NIH 3T3 biotinylated cell membrane proteins were extracted, separated by 4 to 12% gradient gel. membrane proteins were probed with MERS-S-pseudotyped virus followed by detection of virus binding. the polyclonal antibody against human DPP4 also cross-reacted with DPP4 on a number of nonhuman mammalian cells. despite being recognized by the human DPP4 antibody, the expression of CEACAM5 was more restricted. however, little to no CEACAM5 expression was detected on AD293, BEAS2B, and Caco2 cells. the numbers represent the percentage of positive cells. the same fixation and immunostaining procedures were performed for human primary T cells (B) and a number of nonhuman mammalian cells (C). representative images of CEACAM5 and DPP4 expression in various regions of the human lung are shown. the arrowheads indicate alveolar macrophages with CEACAM5 and DPP4 coexpression. CEACAM5-V5- or empty-vector-transfected BHK21 cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-V5 preadsorbed protein A/G Sepharose. as a negative control, the V5 empty vector did not pull down MERS-CoV S1 (Fig. 4C, top, lane 3) co-IP was performed using CEACAM5-V5 as the bait. Western blots were detected with the anti-FLAG or the anti-CEACAM5 antibody. we first assessed the capacity of CEACAM5 antibody to block the entry of MERS-S pseudovirus. the antibody blocking experiment was further validated using infectious MERS-CoV under a titration of different CEACAM5 antibody concentrations ranging from 0.5 g/ml to 4 g/ml. culated cells were then washed and incubated in DMEM culture medium. CEACAM5 antibody significantly reduced MERS-CoV propagation in both cell lysates and supernatants of infected Huh7 cells. the impact of CEACAM5 inhibition on MERS-CoV replication was investigated in Huh7 cells. the cells were preincubated with antibodies at 2 g/ml for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. the cells were then inoculated with MERS-CoV at an MOI of 0.0005 for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. the human CEACAM5 recombinant protein blocked the entry of MERS-CoV in a dose-dependent manner in both Calu3 and Huh7 cells. as a control, CEACAM5 protein added after MERS-CoV inoculation had no effect on virus entry. human recombinant DPP4 and human recombinant IgG were included as positive and negative controls. results from the human recombinant DPP4-, human recombinant CEACAM5-, and control human recombinant IgG-treated samples were compared with those of mock-treated samples. overexpressing BHK21 cells were inoculated with high-MOI MERS-CoV at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. the cells were then washed, harvested, and immunolabeled for flow cytometry. in both cases, DPP4-overexpressing BHK21 cells were included as controls. human CEACAM5-expressing BHK21 cells were challenged with MERS-CoV at an MOI of 30 for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. human CEACAM5-expressing BHK21 cells were then challenged with MERS-CoV at an MOI of 5 for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. the cells were incubated for another 4 h before being harvested for flow cytometry. the means and standard deviations were derived from the results of three independent experiments. Statistical analyses were carried out using Student's t test. asterisks indicated statistical significance is indicated by the asterisks. CEACAM5-transfected veroE6 cells were challenged with SARS-S pseudovirus or VSV-G pseudovirus at a ratio of 100 LP per cell for 1 h. means and standard deviation were derived from the results of three independent experiments. identification of CEACAM5 as a cell surface binding protein of MERS-CoV. the relevant fractions from the SDS-PAGE gel were excised, electroeluted, and hybridized with MERS-S-pseudotyped virus. the protein at around 90 kDa returned a much stronger signal and was selected for subsequent analyses. the protein was human CEACAM5, using the MASCOT search engine against the NCBI and Swiss-Prot databases. to verify the relevance of CEACAM5 in MERS-CoV entry, we investigated the expression of CEACAM5 on a number of cell types. different cell types in 6-well plates were detached with EDTA, washed, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. the percentage of positive cells and the surface mean fluorescent intensities were determined by flow cytometry. surface expression of CEACAM5 on mammalian cells. the indicated human cell lines were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. the shaded curves and the open curves represent isotype- and antigen-specific staining. arrowheads indicate alveolar macrophages with CEACAM5 and DPP4 coexpression. arrowheads indicate alveolar macrophages with CEACAM5 and DPP4 coexpression. arrowheads indicate alveolar macrophages with CEACAM5 coexpression. CEACAM5-V5- or empty-vector-transfected BHK21 cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-V5 preadsorbed protein A/G Sepharose. antibody against human CEACAM5 did not pick up any signal from the BHK21 cell lysates. the interaction between MERS-CoV spike and CEACAM5 was confirmed by reciprocal co-IP using antibody against MERS-CoV spike. in contrast, MERS-CoV spike was not detected from uninfected samples or from infected samples immunoprecipitated with nonspecific rabbit IgG. Western blots were detected with the anti-FLAG or the anti-CEACAM5 antibody. CEACAM5-specific antibody blocks MERS-CoV entry and spread. antibody added after MERS-CoV inoculation did not affect virus entry. addition of the CEACAM5 antibody did not prevent the entry of MERS-CoV into Caco2 cells. antibody blocking experiment was performed in Calu3 cells using MERS-S-pseudotyped virus. the cells were then inoculated with MERS-CoV at an MOI of 1 for 1 h at 37\u00b0C in the presence of the antibodies. after 1 h, the cells were washed and harvested. the results were normalized to that of the mock-treated cells. human recombinant CEACAM5 protein and human recombinant IgG were included as controls. human recombinant protein and human recombinant IgG were included as controls. cells were inoculated for 2 h with the virus-protein mixtures. CEACAM5 recombinant protein and siRNA knockdown of CEACAM5 inhibit MERS-CoV entry. the protein-virus mixture was added to Calu3 cells (A) or Huh7 cells (B) for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. the cell lysates were harvested for qPCR analysis. the data are represented as means and standard deviations of the results of three independent experiments. to further define the role of CEACAM5 in MERS-CoV entry and attachment, we examined the capacity of CEACAM5 to support MERS-CoV. human CEACAM5 was overexpressed in BHK21 and AD293 cells. the cells were then challenged with MERS-CoV at an MOI of 5 for 2 h. the cells were incubated for another 4 h before being harvested for flow. human CEACAM5-expressing BHK21 cells were challenged with MERS-CoV at an MOI of 30 for 2 h at 4\u00b0C before being harvested for flow cytometry. the data are represented as the percentage of MERS-CoV NP-positive BHK21 cells after infection with or without DPP4/CEACAM5 overepression. the means and standard deviations were derived from the results of three independent experiments. Statistical analyses were carried out using Student's t test. Statistical significance is indicated by the asterisks (P 0.05) a series of co-IP studies demonstrated the capacity of CEACAM5 to bind to the spike protein of MERS-CoV in either overexpressed or endogenous settings. recombinant expression of CEACAM5 did not confer susceptibility to infection by MERS-CoV on nonpermissive BHK21 cells. however, the entry of MERS-CoV was significantly inhibited by CEACAM5 overexpression. some CEACAMs, including CEACAM5, are expressed on the apical membranes of epithelial cells and are exploited as receptors or binding factors for a number of pathogenic bacteria. the discovery of CEACAM5 as a cellular binding target of MERS-CoV spike suggested that perhaps cell surface CEACAMs are common binding targets of coronavirus spike proteins that can be exploited for attachment or entry. MHV binds CEACAM1 at the first 330 amino acids of the S1 NTD. MHV may similarly bind CEACAM5 with the NTD of S1. this may orchestrate the DPP4-S1 CTD interaction (36, 39) CEACAM5 may help to concentrate the virus particles at the cell surface and provide the virus particles with greater accessibility to DPP4. this novel surface binding protein could facilitate MERS-CoV entry."}
