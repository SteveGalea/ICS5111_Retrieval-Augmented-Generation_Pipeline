{"summary": "major improvements have been achieved in surgery or chemotherapy treatments for CRC [3-5] however, recurrence and metastasis are very common. there is an urgent need to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms of CRC and find new molecular targets. cell culture human CRC cell lines SW48, SW403, COLO205, SW620, COLO320DM, KM202L, SW480 and normal colonic cell line FHC were purchased from National Rodent Laboratory Animal Resource. all CRC cell lines were grown in DMEM/F-12 medium with 10% FBS, 10 ng/mL cholera toxin, 5 g/mL transferrin, 5 g/mL insulin, 100 ng/mL hydrocortisone small interfering RNA (siRNA) was synthesized and purified using lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for CCND3 depletion, small interfering RNA (siRNA) was synthesized and purified by RiboBio Co. (Guangzhou, Guangdong, China) the membranes were blocked in TBST (Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Triton X-100) containing 5% non-fat milk for two hours. the membrane was incubated overnight with anti-CCND3 (1:500; Abcam), anti-retinoblastoma (anti-Rb, 1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology) and anti-phosphorylated Rb (anti-p-Rb, 1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology) antibodies the agar-cell mixture was plated on top of a bottom layer consisting of 1% agar in complete medium. cells were incubated for 14 days at 37\u00b0C until colony formation. only cell colonies containing more than 50 cells were counted. human CRC cell lines SW48, SW403, COLO205, SW620, COLO320DM, KM202L, SW480 and normal colonic cell line FHC were grown in DMEM/F-12 medium with 10% FBS, 10 ng/mL cholera toxin, 5 g/mL transferrin, 5 g/mL insulin, 100 ng/mL hydrocortisone and extra 10 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-pipe miR-592 mimic, miR-592 inhibitor, miR-592-mut and negative control were purchased from GeneCopoeia (Guangzhou, China) for CCND3 depletion, small interfering RNA (siRNA) was synthesized and purified by RiboBio Co. the membranes were blocked in TBST (Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Triton X-100) containing 5% non-fat milk for two hours. the membrane was incubated overnight with anti-CCND3 (1:500; Abcam), anti-retinoblastoma (anti-Rb, 1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology) and anti-phosphorylated Rb (anti-p-Rb, 1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology) antibodies agar-cell mixture was plated on top of a bottom layer consisting of 0.3% agar in complete medium. cells were incubated for 14 days at 37\u00b0C until colony formation. only cell colonies containing more than 50 cells were counted. expression of miR-592 was down-regulated compared to the normal colonic cell line FHC. in all 8 tested cells, miR-592 was down-regulated compared to the normal colonic cell line FHC. the results suggest that miR-592 was down-regulated both in human CRC samples and cell lines. fected with miR-592-in were significantly increased the cell growth rate. all these results showed that miR-592 inhibited cell proliferation of CRC in vitro. potential target of miR-592 was predicted using TargetScan 6.2. CCND3 suppresses CCND3 expression by directly targeting the CCND3 3\u2019-UTR and altered levels of proteins related to proliferation in SW48 cells. CCND3 mRNAs were cotransfected with miR-592mimic, miR-592-in, miR-592-mut or miR-NC for 48 h. the reporter plasmid with wild type targeting sequence of CCND3 mRNA caused a significant decrease in luciferase activity in cells transfected with miR-592. CCND3 exerts its functions by preventing activity of the cyclin D/cdk4 CCND3 effectively decreased the expression of CCND3 in miR-592-in-transfected SW48 cells. CCND3 suppression is required for miR-592-in induced cell proliferation of CRC. expression of miR-592 in human colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues and cell lines was down-regulated. expression levels in 8 paired primary CRC tissues (T) and adjacent non-tumor tissues (TAT) from same patient were detected by PCR analysis. up-regulation of miR-592 inhibited growth of SW48 cells. c. Representative micrographs and quantification of colonies that were > 0.1 mm. each bar represents the mean of three independent experiments. miR-592 target sequence in 3\u2019-UTR of CCND3 (CCND3-3\u2019-UTR) and positions of three mutated nucleotides in the 3\u2019-UTR of miR-592 (miR-592-mut) CCND3 protein expression in SW48 cells transfected with miR-592 or the miR-592 inhibitor were detected by western blotting analysis. reporter plasmid with wild type targeting sequence of CCND3 mRNA caused significant decrease in luciferase activity in cells transfected with miR-592. CCND3 exerts its functions by preventing activity of the cyclin D/cdk4/6 complex, which in turn may cause the inhibition of the phosphorylation of Rb. CCND3 suppression is required for miR-592-induced cell proliferation in CRC. CCND3 suppression is required for miR-592-in induced proliferation of CRC. CCND3 suppression is required for miR-592-in induced proliferation of CRC. miR-592 is significantly down-regulated in CRC and inhibits cell proliferation in vitro. CCND3 protein is critical in cell growth, proliferation, and development of cancer."}
