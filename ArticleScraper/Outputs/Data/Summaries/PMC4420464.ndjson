{"summary": "previous studies suggested a close association between the rs12252 and influenza susceptibility and severity. rs12252 induced severe morbidity and mortality throughout the world. the rs12252-C allele causes a 23.7% higher chance of infection. it also constitutes a risk factor for more severe influenza. despite the effective vaccination, influenza remains a major global health threat due to the high morbidity and mortality caused by seasonal epidemics. interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) inhibit infection of diverse enveloped viruses, including the influenza A virus. IFITM3 is considered to be most active against IAV and resides in late endosomes and lysosomes using several orthologous genetic approaches. we conducted a systematic meta-analysis with characteristics of large sample sizes and two ethnic populations. this study should be helpful in the prevention and treatment of severe influenza as well as in studying host-virus interaction during pathogenesis in future. patients were definitively diagnosed with influenza confirmed by viral genome polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. a total score from 0 to 22 was reported for each article. cochran\u2019s 2 -based Q statistic test was performed to assess possible heterogeneity between the individual studies. the fixed-effects model was applied to calculate the pooled OR with its 95% CI when there was no obvious heterogeneity between studies. a study was considered appropriate for the meta-analysis when it met the following criteria. it evaluated the association of IFITM3 SNP rs12252 and influenza risk. all patients were definitively diagnosed with influenza confirmed by viral genome polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. studies would be divided into 3 grades: Grade A (scored 15\u201322, high quality), Grade B (scored 8\u201314, medium quality), or Grade C (scored 0\u20137, inferior quality) only the studies of Grade A or B would be included in the final analysis. a random-effects model was applied to calculate the pooled OR with its 95% CI when there was no obvious heterogeneity between studies. the flow chart of article selection process is described in Fig 1. Flow chart of data selection. studies characteristics include country of origin, ethnicity, type of virus, sample size, type of control, genotyping method, and deviation from HWE. a significant increase in influenza susceptibility was found in the recessive model (CC vs. CT+TT: OR = 2.35, 95% CI: 1.49\u20133.70, P0.001), the dominant model (CC+CT vs. TT: OR = 1.60, 95% CI: 1.49\u20133.70, P0.001). homozygote comparison (CC vs. TT: OR = 4.11, 95% CI: 2.15\u20137.84, P0.001) and allele contrast (C vs. T: OR = 1.67, 95% CI: 1.32\u20132.13, P0.001) but not for the heterozygote comparison (CT vs. TT: OR = 1.37, 95% CI: 0.98\u20131.92, P = 0.07) a significant increase in influenza susceptibility was found ethnicity in the recessive model and homozygote comparison respectively are shown in Figs 2 and 3. no association was found between rs12252 and mild influenza subjects. results suggest a significant association between a minor IFITM3 allele with severe influenza susceptibility, but not in mild influenza subjects.

CC genotype is rare in both UK Caucasians and Han Chinese. the incidence of severe influenza infection might be higher in Chinese than in Northern Europeans. this is the first meta-analysis evaluating the association between IFITM3 SNP rs12252 and influenza susceptibility and severity. the rs12252-C allele causes a 23.7% higher chance of infection and also constitutes a risk factor for more severe influenza."}
