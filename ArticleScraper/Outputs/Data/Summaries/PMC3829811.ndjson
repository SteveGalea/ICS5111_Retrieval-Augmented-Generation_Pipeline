{"summary": "a total of 61 genes were differentially expressed by both samples. most genes were closely clustered together suggesting a homogeneous expression. the majority of the genes that were significantly regulated were those associated with monocytes-macrophage and Th1 cell functions. apoptosis associated gene PD-1 expressions in fIPV infected CRFK cells and in PBMCs from healthy and FIP diagnosed cats produced concordant results with transcriptome data. FECV is very common in the cat population worldwide, and has been shown to have infected 20-60% pet cats and shed by 75-100% cats in multi-cat environments. apoptosis of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells is probably caused by mediators from infected macrophages and/or intestinal epithelial cells. apoptosis of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells is probably caused by mediators from infected macrophages and/or intestinal epithelial cells. trimmed sequence reads match to 25,689 annotated transcripts. only 96 (44.7%) transcripts were expressed with fold absolute change. of the 44 up-regulated genes, there were 2 transcripts per gene for 32 genes. most genes from both samples are closely clustered except for 4 genes label 1 to 6. 1 and 2 are MX1 transcripts 1 and 2, respectively, 3 and 4 = RSAD2 transcripts 1 and 2, respectively, 5 = PLIN2 and 6 = SERPINB1. the majority of the genes were those associated with immune response, while the rest were associated with apoptosis, cell cycle, cytokine, and ubiquitination activities.

PD-L1 gene was consistently down-regulated from 3 hours to 48 h. the highest expression fold for A3H, PD-1 and PD-L1 genes was detected from cat no. 3 at 3.44 0.36, 68.13 19.45, and 96.94 21.54 fold changes. cat no. 5 showed less fold changes of the genes compared to other FIP diagnosed cats. only cats with titer S3-S6 are considered positive for FIP based on the manual. the manual stated that S3 a significant positive response is equivalent to IFA titer 1:20. of the 17 down-regulated genes, there was one transcript per gene for 14 genes and 2 transcripts per gene for 3 genes. the plot excluded 3 genes (CCL8, RNF7, and RPL39) that had infinite fold change expressions. the plot excluded 4 genes label 1 to 6. the majority of the down-regulated genes were involved in pro-inflammatory cytokine\u2019s activation, CMI, and anti-apoptosis activities. the latter had anti-apoptotic effect and the latter translated RNA to protein. viral RNA/DNA causing mutation 10** 5.35/ 4.48 MDA5 NG_ 011495 ISG, viral RNA sensor induce cytokines and interferons 11* 4.96/ 3.00 IFI35 XM_ 002930054 ISG, inhibit viral gene transcription 12* 4.46/ 3.90 TRIM25 XM_ 548223 ubiquitination of RIG-I and ISG15 induce type I IFN 13* 4.46/ 4.34 MX poptosis inducer, clathrin dependent endocytosis 03** -2.14/ -2.44 JUB XM_ 537368 co-trancriptional repressor with GFI-1, cell adhesion 04 -2.22 SERPINB1 AF 053630 neutrophil proteolytic activity inhibitor, cell adhesion 04 -2.34 CD59 NM_ 001112709 T-cell differentiation, gene transcription repression 06 -2. real-time RT-qPCR analysis of CRFK infected cells. three host genes (A3H, PD-1, and PD-L1) were selected for real-time RT-qPCR analysis because they were highly up-regulated and may play important roles during FIPV induced disease. transcriptome resulted in 4.07 and 5.65 fold change for 2 transcripts of A3H while real-time PCR resulted in 5.23 1.15 fold changes. FIPV induced high and exceptionally high A3H expression at 3 and 48 h.p.i. from 6 to 24 h.p.i., the gene was down-regulated. PD-L1 gene was consistently down-regulated from 3 hours to 48 h.p.i. the kit\u2019s CombScale range from S0 to S6. only cats with titer S3-S6 are considered to be positive for FIP. the expressions of 215 transcripts were statistically significant. only 96 transcripts, which consisted of 44 up-regulated genes and 17 down-regulated genes, were expressed with fold absolute changes of 2 or more. the expression of A3H is readily expressed at higher levels in PBMCs than in FIPV infected cells. the up-regulation of the gene is less, compared to PD-1 and PD-L1 in FIPV diagnosed cats. the actual reason for this high expression of the gene is unclear. it has been established that cats infected with FIPV undergo extensive tissue destruction due to inflammatory reaction. it is interesting to note that transcriptome analysis of cells proposed that the inflammation process was associated with proinflammatory and Th1-like cytokines production. further study on infection of FIPV on macrophage-like cells will add more value to our findings. earlier in vitro infection is also associated with a marked increase in the expression of RSAD2 (radical S-adenosyl methionine domain-containing protein 2) also known as viperin. previous studies have shown viperin involvement in inhibiting viral RNA and/or protein synthesis during different virus infections. cells were grown in a base media consisting of minimum essential medium (MEM), 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), 2% penicillin and streptomycin, 2% amphotericin B, and non-essential amino acids at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. after incubation, 1% FBS MEM was added and the cells were incubated for further 3 hours. samples with RNA Integrity Numbers (RIN) 9 to 10 and concentrations higher than 500 ng/l per sample were sent for Illumina GAII sequence analysis. the sequences were trimmed for adapter sequences and low quality base. unpaired group comparisons, based on reads per Kilo base per Million, were chosen as expression values for comparison. Primers were designed using Primer-BLAST (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/) and synthesized by AITbiotech PTE LTD (Singapore) the reactions were performed using SensiFASTTM SYBR No-ROX One Step kit (Bioline Ltd, UK) RT-qPCR reaction conditions were as follows. one cycle at 45\u00b0C for 10mins, one cycle at 95\u00b0C for 2 mins, and 35 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 5 secs. 57\u00b0C (YWHAZ), 58\u00b0C (PD-L1), 59\u00b0C (GAPDH), 64\u00b0C (A3H), and 65\u00b0C (PD-1) for 20 secs. two to 5 ml of cat blood was drawn and stored at 4\u00b0C in BD Vacutainer\u00ae (BD USA) EDTA-K2 tubes. part of the blood was used for the test kits, while the rest was processed for PBMCs extraction. total RNA from PBMCs was isolated using an RNeasy mini plus kit. the cells were harvested using TrypLETM and centrifuged twice in a PBS at 4\u00b0C for 5 minutes at 1000rpm. the same process was applied, with the exception that 2 ml of sterile PBS was used to replace the virus. RNA extraction and sequencing An RNeasy\u00ae Mini Kit was used to extract and purify RNA samples as per the methods recommended by the manufacturer. the expression profiles of 3 genes (A3H, PD-1, and PD-L1) were analysed using real-time RT-qPCR. the expression profiles of 3 genes (A3H, PD-1, and PD-L1) were analysed using real-time PCR. reaction mixture of 20 l contained 10 l 2 SensiFAST SYBR No-ROX One-Step mix, 0.5 l forward & reverse primers (5 nM for GADPH, PD-L1 and A3H, 3 nM for PD-1 and 10 nM for YWHAZ), 0.2 l RT, 0.4 l RiboSafe RNase inhibitor, 2.5 l H2O, and 6 l extracted RNA. real-time RT-qPCR analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from FIP diagnosed cats. six domestic short hair breed cats, with ages ranging from 8 months to adult, were considered for this study. 5 healthy cats, with negative results for FCoV, FeLV, and FIV antibodies, were selected as controls. the isolated RNA samples were either kept at -80\u00b0C for further analysis, or immediately used for real-time RT-qPCR analysis. authors declare that we have no competing interests. list of 20 transcripts from 17 down regulated genes with proportions fold change of -2 or more (Kal\u2019s Z test, FDR 0.05) with their BLAST results, NCBI accession number and gene product function."}
