{"summary": "isatin-thiosemicarbazones have been found to demonstrate numerous chemotherapeutic properties such as anticancer, antimicrobial, antituberculosis, antiulcer, antiviral, antiplasmodial, cytotoxic and urease inhibition. a number of isatin-3-thiosemicarbazones, prepared earlier in our laboratory, displayed different biological activities. certain N4-aryl substituted 5-nitroisatin-3-thiosemicabazones exhibit more cytotoxic activity than their alkyl and alkenyl counterparts. this combined effect of substitution of different inductively electron-attracting groups at position-5 of the isatin part and the attachment of a variety of aryl substituents to N4 of the thiosemicarbazone moiety would result in increased toxic activity. IR spectra of 3a-3u showed absorption bands of NH stretching in the 3354\u20133200 and 3196\u20133055 cm1 regions. absorption bands of lactam C=O, azomethine C=N and thioamide C=S stretchings appeared in the 1705\u20131692, 1629\u20131564 and 1182\u20131143 cm1 regions. the synthetic route to the title compounds 3a-3u was screened for toxic activity by a brine shrimp (Artemia salina) lethality bioassay. the compound 2-(2-oxo-1,2-dihydro-3H-indol-3-ylidene)-N-phenyl-1-hydrazinecarbothioamide served as reference compound (without a substituent in the isatin part as well as on the phenyl ring ent at position-4 of the phenyl ring showed enhanced toxicity. compounds 3n and 3o possessing fluoro groups at positions-2,4 and -2,6 of the phenyl ring showed increased toxic activity. compound 3l with trifluoromethoxy group at position-5 of the isatin scaffold showed almost the same activity. corresponding compounds without trifluoromethoxy group at position-5 of the isatin moiety gave LD50 values of 5.10 105 M, 3.10 105 M, 4.60 105 M, 1.26 104 M, 1.20 104 M and 1.10 105 M respectively. compounds 3i, 3j and 3p with 2-trifluoromethyl, 3-trifluoromethyl and 3,5-difluoro substituents about the phenyl ring showed reduced toxic activity. compound 3q has fluoro and bromo substituents at positions-2 and -4 of the phenyl ring, respectively, exhibited induced toxic activity (LD50 = 1.60 104 M) on the whole, out of twenty one compounds tested for toxic activity, 10 proved to be active, exhibiting promising toxicity. the remaining compounds i.e., 3b-3d, 3f-3h, 3m and 3r-3u gave LD50 values ranging from >1.98 104 M to >2.51 104 M in the present assay. the next potent compounds were found to be 3n and 3o with fluoro groups at positions-2,4 and -2,6 of the phenyl ring, showing toxic activity with LD50 values of 1.43 105 M and 1.34 105 M the IR spectra of 3a-3u showed the absorption bands of NH stretching in the 3354\u20133200 and 3196\u20133055 cm1 regions. the absorption bands of lactam C=O, azomethine C=N and thioamide C=S stretchings appeared in the 1705\u20131692, 1629\u20131564 and 1182\u20131143 cm1 regions. the compound 2-(2-oxo-1,2-dihydro-3H-indol-3-ylidene)-N-phenyl-1-hydrazinecarbothioamide served as reference compound (without a substituent in the isatin part as well as on the phenyl ring) the results given in the table 1 revealed that substitution of trifluoromethoxy group alone in the isatin scaffold or in combination with some other functions on the phenyl 3o possessing fluoro groups at positions-2,4 and -2,6 of the phenyl ring showed increased toxic activity (LD50 = 1.43 105 M and 1.34 105 M, respectively) in comparison to the corresponding compounds having no trifluoromethoxy substituent at position-5 of the isatin part, giving the same LD50 values of 2.00 105 M. 10 105 M, 3.10 105 M, 4.60 105 M, 1.26 104 M, 1.20 104 M and 1.10 105 M respectively. compounds 3i, 3j and 3p with 2-trifluoromethyl, 3-trifluoromethyl and 3,5-difluoro substituents showed reduced toxic activity (LD50 = 1.80 104 M, 1.70 104 M and 4.32 105 M, respectively) Brine shrimp bioassay of compounds 3a-3u. ten i.e.,3a, 3e, 3i-3l and 3n-3q proved to be active. remaining compounds gave LD50 values ranging from >1.98 104 M to >2.51 104 M. k having an inductively electron-attracting trifluoromethyl substituent at position-4 of the phenyl ring proved to be the most potent toxicant. the next potent compounds were found to be 3n and 3o with fluoro groups at positions-2,4 and -2,6 of the phenyl ring. these preliminary results indicate that structural modifications may lead to the development of novel compounds with improved toxicity. in vitro biological evaluation of the synthesized compounds was done at Panjwani Center for Molecular Medicine and Drug Research, H.E.J.
