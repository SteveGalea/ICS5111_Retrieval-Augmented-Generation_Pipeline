{"summary": "encephalitis has emerged as an encephalitis causing pathogen in both epidemic and sporadic forms. this pediatric disease follows rapid course leading to 55\u201375% mortality. in the absence of specific treatment, effectiveness of RNA interference (RNAi) was assessed. r resulted in 40% and 20% survival respectively. results highlight therapeutic potential of siRNA in treating rapid and fatal Chandipura encephalitis. RNAi has emerged as a powerful tool for gene silencing. the central nervous system (CNS) is also acquiescent to RNAi as in the case of brain cancer [18], Spinocerebellar ataxia [19]. a recent study has shown inhibition of rabies virus replication by multiple artificial microRNAs (amiRNA) in neuro 2a cells. transfected cells were observed under florescent microscope periodically to check the expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused CHPV P protein and confirmed by western blotting using anti-GFP antibodies. design and synthesis of siRNA All CHPV sequences present in the GenBank [23] and the sequences of the new isolates generated in the lab.

RNA was isolated using RNAeasy minikit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) to remove plasmid 80U RNase-free DNaseTM (Promega, Madison, USA) enzyme was used. each real time one step RT-PCR assay had at least two no amplification controls (NAC) in which RT enzyme was substituted by DNase-RNase free water to check for the DNA contamination. the cells were grown to near confluence in 24-well tissue culture plate. the cells were adsorbed with a 10-fold serially diluted supernatant containing CHPV at 37\u00b0C for 60 min. the cells were incubated for 2 days and stained with crystal violet. TTCGGCTCCAAA Comparison of P-2 siRNA and P-2 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) efficiency. DNA oligos were synthesized and named as pH1-P2 or pCMV-P2 depending upon the plasmid promoter used for expression of shRNA. the oligos were synthesized by IDT, USA. Sense and antisense oligos were annealed and ligated to either pSilencer 3.1 H1 neo or pSilencer 4.1 CMV neo vectors. all the clones were screened by restriction digestion and confirmed by sequencing. mouse infection BALB/c mice aged 4\u20136 wks were used for all in vivo experiments. these experiments were done in a biosafety level 2 animal facility. mice were inoculated intracranially (ic) with CHPV. siRNAs were complexed with HiPerfectTM (QIAGEN, Valencia CA) mice were euthanized and brains/spleens were removed. hek-293 cells were transfected with 2 g each of pAcGFP1N1 and pAcGFP1N1-CHPV-P. hek-293 cells were transfected with 2 g each of pAcGFP1N1 and pAcGFP1N1-CHPV-P. negative control siRNA (ncsiRNA) with no significant homology to any known mammalian gene was used as a non-silencing control in all RNAi experiments. negative control plasmid (NCP) was used in shRNA experiments (Ambion, USA) amaxa nucleofactor II device and supplemented kit V solution was used as suggested by the manufacturer. for transfection of siRNA, amaxa nucleofactor II device and supplemented kit V solution was used. hek-293 cells were seeded 12\u201316 hr before transfection in a six-well plate (1105 per well) cell supernatants were harvested 24 hr post transfection. RNA isolated using QIAmp viral RNA minikit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) and real time one step RT-PCR was carried out as described earlier [24]. tolerance for mismatches in the siRNA relative to target mRNA. different siRNAs with mismatches at specific positions were designed. the sequence was subjected to the link www.ambion.com/techlib/misc/psilencer_converter.html. RNA22 (http://cbcsrv.watson.ibm.com/rna22_targets.html) and RNAhybrid (http://bibiserv.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/rnahybrid/submission.html) revealed that CHPV P gene has two potential binding site for hsa-miR-93. all the oligos were synthesized by IDT, USA. different shRNA expressing plasmids were individually transfected 24 hr at post transfection. cells were infected with 36 PFU/ml of CHPV. at 12 and 24 hr post PI, cells were assayed for the presence of the CHPV. mice aged 4\u20136 wks were used for all in vivo experiments. mice were inoculated intracranially (ic) with CHPV. mice were euthanized and brains/spleens were removed. real time one step RT-PCR, RNA isolated using Ribopure RNA isolation Kit (Ambion, USA) according to manufacturer's instructions and 500 ng of total RNA was used per reaction. RNA from spleens of the mice (n = 3) were pooled and samples were run in duplicate on 7900-HT fast real time PCR machine. pAcGFP1N1-CHPV-P showed cytoplasmic localization of fusion protein P gene siRNA validation with pAcGFP1N1-CHPV-P and CHPV. at 24 hr post transfection, cells transfected with both P gene siRNAs showed that P-2 siRNA could reduce the GFP expression and P gene expression approximately by 80%. siRNAs with virus and comparison with P-2 siRNA M gene siRNAs (M1-M8) were tested with the virus and efficiencies were compared with P-2 siRNA. the results showed P-2, M-5 and M-6 to be equally potent in inhibiting CHPV induced cytopathic effects. infection with CHPV at as low as 36 PFU/ml and as high as 3600 PFU/ml did not alter the efficiency of the siRNA the reduction was 2logs in all cases. results are expressed as means SD. pol III (pH1-P2) or pol II promoter (pCMV-P2) was as efficient as P-2 siRNA. the reduction was approximately 70% (p0.05) intracranial route was used for infection with the virus. 100LD50 CHPV and single dose of ncsiRNA were administered. virus dose was reduced to 10 LD50. both mice groups were sacrificed on 5th day post-CHPV inoculation. expression of IFN- (>100-fold), IL-10 (17fold), IL-1 (2.8 fold), IL-15 (8-fold), SOCS-1(17-fold) and TNF (5-fold) cytokines genes were upregulated at 24hr PI. expression of the chemokines genes (Ccl-2, >200-fold; csf2, >10-fold and Ccxl-10, 30-fold) and surface receptor molecules (FasL, >2.5 fold and IL-2R, 4-fold) were upregulated at the initial phase of infection, but decreased at later time points. none of the above changes observed in CHPV infected mice were recorded in mice treated with P-2 siRNA or control mice receiving P-2 siRNA complexed hek-293 cells transfected with pAcGFP1N1 and pAcGFP1N1-CHPV-P showed cytoplasmic localization of fusion protein P gene siRNA validation with pAcGFP1N1-CHPV-P and CHPV. p-1, P-3 and P-4 were not very effective in reducing replication. doses of P-2 siRNA on expression of P gene determined by flowcytometry and real time one step RT-PCR. efficiencies were compared with P-2 siRNA. results showed P-2, M-5 and M-6 to be equally potent in inhibiting CHPV induced cytopathic effects as observed by phase-contrast microscopy. infection with CHPV at as low as 36 PFU/ml and as high as 3600 PFU/ml did not alter the efficiency of the siRNA the reduction being 2logs in all cases. results are expressed as means SD. short hairpin RNA (shRNA) validation with pAcGPF1N1-CHPV-P plasmid and with CHPV Flowcytometery and real time one step RT-PCR documented that P-2 shRNA expressed either from pH1-P2 or pCMV-P2 was as efficient as P-2 siRNA. the reduction was approximately 70% (p0.05) perfect was less effective than nucleofaction (2logs reduction at 12hr for both and 1log less at 24hr) for all in-vivo experiments, 100LD50 CHPV was used for delivery of P-2 siRNA. as adult mice are not susceptible to CHPV by peripheral route, intracranial route was used for infection. histopathology of the brains of ncsiRNA treated mice showed typical features of viral encephalitis. both mice groups were sacrificed on 5th day post-CHPV inoculation. expression of IFN- (>100-fold), IL-10 (17fold), IL-1 (2.8 fold), IL-15 (8-fold) and SOCS-1(17-fold) was upregulated at 24hr PI. expression of the chemokines genes (Ccl-2, >200-fold; csf2, >10-fold and Ccxl-10, 30-fold) and surface receptor molecules (FasL, >2.5 fold and IL-2R, 4-fold) were upregulated at the initial phase of infection, but decreased at later time points. anti-CHP-IgG antibodies were absent on days 7, 14 and 21 post-infection in surviving mice. the first step was selection of the viral gene(s) to be targeted by RNAi. we selected P and M genes as (1) P protein is indispensable for the activity of L protein which functions as RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and (2) M protein is most lethal protein encoded by rhabdoviruses. inhibition of CHPV replication in P-2 and M-5/M-6 siRNA treated cells was assessed by G gene and P gene-based real time PCRs respectively. in both cases, 2logs reduction was recorded. this may reflect the possibility of these siRNAs targeting their cognate mRNA but also the positive (+) strand pre-genomic RNA thus affecting overall replication of the virus. siRNA was effectively shown for the treatment of JEV encephalitis in mice by using lentiviral vector. 100% survival was recorded when mice were injected IC with pseudotyped RV-G lentiviral vector expressing shRNA specific for JEV. cationic lipid formulation, i-Fect (Neuromics) was found to deliver siRNA into neuronal cells without toxicity. survival was reduced to 40% and 20% respectively. a single injection containing 40ug of siRNA with JetSI/DOPE led to complete protection. a single injection containing 40ug of siRNA with JetSI/DOPE led to complete protection. IFN has been shown to have antiviral effect both against VSV [41] and CHPV [42]. Fig 10a clearly documents excessive upregulation of IFN gene in the early stages of the infection followed by drastic decrease. however, desired effect was not achieved leading to death. the gene profiling results clearly demonstrate that none of the genes modulated during the course of CHPV infection were affected in P-2 siRNA treated mice. the siRNA did not allow replication of CHPV and therefore did not lead to the cascade of immune reactions leading either to recovery or death."}
