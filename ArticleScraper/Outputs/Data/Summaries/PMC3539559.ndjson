{"summary": "material/Methods We retrieved papers published in 105 public health-related journals from ML, HK and TW. total papers, impact factor, times cited, papers published in the highest impact factor journals were analyzed for quantity and quality comparisons among the 3 regions. scienceWatch.com provides a behind-the-scenes look at the scientists, journals, institutions, nations, and papers selected by Essential Science IndicatorsSM. according to ScienceWatch.com in December 2009, china ranked 5th place in number of papers in all fields and the 9th place in total citations. there have been no studies evaluating the quantity and quality of Chinese research production in public health. after identification of the 105 journals, we ran the \u201cWeb of Science\u201d application in the ISI database. we analyzed the Countries/Territories of all the papers from each of the 3 regions using the \u201cCombine Search History\u201d and \u201cRefine Results\u201d functions on \u201cWeb of Science\u201d. the literature searching date (February 27, 2010) were calculated for each of the 3 regions. papers published in the top10 highest impact factor public health journals were generated. the top 10 public health journals in which authors published most often among the 3 regions were determined according to the numbers of published papers. we ran the \u201cWeb of Science\u201d application in the ISI web of knowledge database. the search engine produced a list of papers, including all available abstracts. the procedure was performed in exactly the same way for all of the 105 journals on February 27, 2010. the top 10 public health journals in which authors published most often among the 3 regions were determined according to the numbers of published papers. both data searching and paper selection processes were performed independently by 2 authors (Zheng ML and Yang LL) Discrepencies were resolved by consensus. ML had the most papers annually contributed between 1999 and 2003. in 2008, the number of papers from ML (226) exceeded the combined number of papers from HK (61) and TW (137). the trend of the number of papers from mainland, Hong Kong, and Taiwan between 1999 and 2008. 1999 1.540 2.144 2.257 2.257 2.665 2000 1.676 2.683 2.849 2.849 2001 1.582 2.113 2.523 2.523 2.439 2002 1.603 2.480 2.428 2.474 2.584 2003 1.432 2.277 2.704 2.704 2.845 2004 1.526 2.062 2.649 2.683 2.476 2005 1.430 2.231 2.447 2.447 2.653 2006 1.416 2.027 2.450 2.484 2.545 2007 the journal Biomedical and Environmental Sciences (BES) was jointly established by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the Coulston International Corporation (CIC), USA in 1988. between 1999 and 2008, only 5 papers from HK and none from TW were published in BES; however, 444 papers from ML were published in BES. ML had a lower level of increase in the number of annual papers, and only surpassed TW in the year 2008. journal 2009 IF Total publications during 1999\u20132008 Papers from China (%) Paper distribution in three regions of China ML (%) HK (%) TW (%) 1 Environmental Health Perspectives 6.191 4,502 70 (1.55) 18 (26) 6 (8) 46 (66) 2 American Journal of Epidemiology 5.589 3,504 40 (1.14) 3 (7) 13 (33) 24 (60) 3 Epidemiology 5.511 1,581 14 (0.89) 3 (21) 7 (50) 4 (29) 4 Bullet the accumulated IF of the top 10 journals in ML (18.610) was the lowest in comparison with HK (28.944) and TW (26.438) the public health journals in which authors published most often among mainland, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. there were 2587 (2.3%) papers with the first affiliation from the 3 regions of china, including 1089 (42.1%) from ML, 471 (18.2%) from HK, and 1027 (39.7%) from TW. the total number of papers from the 3 regions increased significantly over the 10 years in each of the 3 regions. ML\u2019s researchers cooperated with colleagues in 87 countries. HK and TW both cooperated with colleagues in 37 countries. the USA contributed to 60.7% (603), 32.3% (64) and 83.0% (220) of papers. the average times cited per paper of publications from mainland, Hong Kong, and Taiwan published in public health journals between 1999 and 2008. between 1999 and 2008, only 5 papers from HK and none from TW were published in BES. between 1999 and 2008, only 5 papers from HK and none from TW were published in BES. a total of 320 papers were published in the top 10 highest impact factor public health journals. ML had a lower level of increase in the number of annual papers, and only surpassed TW in the year 2008. ML had a lower level of increase in the number of annual papers, and only surpassed TW in the year 2008. no journal in which authors of all 3 regions were published in ranked among the top 10 journal lists. accumulated IF of the top 10 journals in ML (18.610) was the lowest in comparison with HK (28.944) and TW (26.438) ML surpassed both HK and TW in the annual number of papers from 2005 onward, showing a total growth of 414% over the 10 years, from 44 to 226. on a \u201cper capita\u201d basis, ML is significantly underperforming compared to HK and TW. more ML medical journals in the English language enter the ISI database [11], which causes a larger number of high-quality papers published from ML to be indexed by the ISI database. at least 1 paper indexed in SCIE is required for most academic promotions in ML China. research papers from ML showed lower average IF compared with those from HK and TW. ML faces the same challenge on a greater scale, compounded by various other problems, including poor capacity to respond to public health emergencies. research output in the 3 regions of china increased dramatically over a 10-year period [5\u20139], which is consistent with the public health publication evaluated in the present study. ML exceeded TW and HK in the research output in gastroenterology and cardiovasology, but ML kept the lower average IF score compared with HK and TW [6,8] the study should reflect the exact status of public health-related output in the whole of china. there was a significant increase in the annual output of papers in all 3 regions of China over a 10-year period."}
