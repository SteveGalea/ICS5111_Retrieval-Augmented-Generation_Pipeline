{"summary": "accurate and timely diagnosis may reduce the transmission of HIV when the individual is most infectious. early detection of HIV has been shown to lead to reduced high-risk behavior and to connect individuals to treatment earlier, which can reduce the risk of virus transmission. 1.1 million people in the u.s. were living with HIV at the end of 2011. there are no definitive guidelines for HIV testing at the POC. rapid antibody tests are available that are FDA-approved. they are not as sensitive for detection of early HIV infection as most laboratory based assays. the RT-LAMP assay was able to detect samples from acutely infected individuals up to 24 days prior to a representative rapid antibody test. the RT primers recognize target sequences within the genome location 2900\u20133118, relative to the HXB2 reference strain. HQ1) was designed to be added directly into the reaction mix as opposed to adding post-reaction. this eliminates the need to open the reaction tubes after amplification. a region within the integrase gene was selected for primer design. an HIV-1 DNA linearity panel was created using the human monocytic cell line OM-10.1. the panel contains a single integrated HIV-1 provirus per cell. a negative DNA control was generated by extracting DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) infected with an HIV-2 isolate. serial plasma specimens were collected from 12 US donors who became HIV-1 infected during the collection period. the seroconversion panels were obtained from SeraCare Life Sciences (n = 7) and ZeptoMetrix Corp. (n = 5). all HIV testing was performed in-house according to the package inserts. the viral loads for each sample were determined by the COBAS AmpliPrep / COBAS TaqMan HIV-1 Monitor Test. the reaction mixture was heated at 60\u00b0C for 60 minutes using a GeneAmp PCR System 9700. each specimen was tested in duplicate with each primer set. a reagent control was included in every run to check for reagent contamination. XB2 sequence (GenBank accession number AF033819) was used as reference for generating the primers. all primers were synthesized in-house and the FIP and BIP primers were HPLC purified. an HIV-1 RNA linearity panel was created using the supernatant from 8E5 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) the viral load of the cell supernatant was determined using the Roche COBAS AmpliPrep / COBAS TaqMan HIV-1 Test V2.0. serial dilutions were made in plasma to create a panel that ranged from 106 to 103 RNA copies/ml. d), fourth-generation GS HIV Combo Ag/Ab EIA (Bio-Rad) and APTIMA HIV-1 Qualitative Assay (Hologic Inc., San Diego, CA) test results were represented as rapid Ab, WB, Ab EIA, Ag + Ab EIA and qualitative RNA. all HIV test results were supplied by the manufacturer, with the exception of the Multispot and the APTIMA. a 5\u2019 HEX label was added to LoopF for RT and LoopB for INT. a reverse transcriptase enzyme allows the amplification of both DNA and RNA simultaneously in the same reaction tube. a 3\u2019 BHQ1-labeled quencher probe was added into the reaction. the sensitivity of the assay for both DNA and RNA was similar to the reported sensitivity for the RT primers. the limit of detection for DNA was 102 copies/ mL and 105\u2013104 RNA copies/ mL, depending on the experiment. members in all seroconversion panels prior to the Ab EIA. 0 to 7 days (median = 3.5) prior to the Ag + Ab EIA. none of the seroconversion panel members became WB positive. rapid Ab test detected panel members 7 to 29 days (median = 19) post first detectable viral load and the first qualitative RNA positive. RT-LAMP assay detected panel members within 0 to 24 days (median = 5) post first detectable viral load. RT-LAMP assay detected panel members anywhere from 2 to 14 days (median = 9) prior to the Ab EIA and 0 to 14 days (median = 2) prior to the Ag + Ab EIA. the RT-LAMP assay was able to detect samples 9 to 29 days (median = 22) before the WB assay. - - - 12007\u20135 2 1.29 x 105 + + + + + - - - - 12007\u20135 2 1.29 x 105 + + + + + + + + IND - 12007\u20136 7 4.89 x 104 + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + the figure shows the timing of test positivity in relation to the rapid antibody test (Day 0) for the Zeptometrix cohort. sensitivity of the assay for both DNA and RNA using the RT primers was similar to the reported sensitivity for the RT primers.

SeraCare panels were not included in the timeline because of the short follow-up time and the fact that only one subject became rapid Ab test reactive during the sample collection period. the panel ID days since 1st VL Viral Load Qual RNA RT RT-LAMP INT RT-LAMP Ag+Ab EIA WB Rapid Ab 6240\u20136 0 2.43x101 + - - - - - - - 6240\u20137 5 2.41 1.0 x 107 + + + + + + - - 12008\u201312 19 1.09 x 105 + + + + + + + + 9079\u20138 0 2.08 x 101 + - - - - - - - - 9079\u20139 5 9.60 x 104 + + + + + + + + + + + + - - - - 9079\u201310 7 3.40 x 105 + + + + + + + + the figure shows the timing of test positivity in relation to the rapid antibody test (Day 0) for the Zeptometrix cohort. this is the first demonstration of acute HIV infection detection using the RT-LAMP assay. a multiplexed approach may be beneficial to circumvent potential mismatches due to resistance mutations induced by antiretroviral use. the RT-LAMP assay may be performed using low-tech, portable heating devices, such as the ESEQuant Tube Scanner (Qiagen, Valencia, CA)[29] or non-instrumented nucleic acid (NINA) heaters. the HIV-1 RT-LAMP assay is estimated to cost 15-40X less per test. RT-LAMP exhibited the expected limit of detection for the assay. peak viral loads during acute HIV infection are estimated to be >100,000 RNA copies/mL. this is not surprising given the large discrepancy in input sample volume between the two assays. the RT-LAMP assay used only 7% of the sample volume required for APTIMA. the sensitivity of the RT-LAMP assay can be increased by increasing the overall reaction volume. LAMP assay has the potential to be implemented at the POC. NAAT testing is currently not feasible due to cost and time limitations."}
