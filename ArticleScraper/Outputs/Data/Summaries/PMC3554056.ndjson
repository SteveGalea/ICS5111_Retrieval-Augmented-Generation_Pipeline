{"summary": "the most studied and the best described are clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), caveola-dependent endocytosis, and macropinocytosis (4). the most studied and the best described are clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), caveola-dependent endocytosis, and macropinocytosis. viruses are usually transported to lysosomes through endosomal vesicles of increasing acidity (10) they can also be transported, specifically for caveola-mediated endocytosis, through neutral pH routes and organelles such as caveosomes (11). vaccinia and herpes simplex viruses are capable of pH-independent PMF. however, they may also infect target cells by pH-dependent FAE. studies using primary human CD4+ T cells showed that both PMF and FAE occur in these cells (20), whereas only PMF seems to be important for infection of dendritic cells (21). macrophages are important targets of HIV-1 and contribute to disease progression by persisting after infection. anti-p24 hybridomas 31-90-25 and 183-H12-5C were obtained from the American Type and Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program (ELISA) both antibodies were purified using MabTrap protein affinity columns. DRAQ5 was obtained from Biostatus (Leicestershire, United Kingdom) and Lysotracker Red from Lonza (allendale, NJ) preparation of macrophages. monocyte-derived macrophages were recovered by scraping following incubation with Accutase. the pNL4-3env molecular clone was obtained by introducing a 1 frameshift in the envelope (Env) precursor. pJRFLenv and pHCMV-G were from N. R. Landau (NYU School of Medicine, New York, NY) and J. C. Burns (UCSD, San Diego, CA), respectively. 293T cells were cotransfected using equimolar amounts of pNLC4.3Balenv and pNLC4.3gag-eGFPBalenv. cells were then washed and treated with trypsin for 5 min to remove uninternalized viruses from their surface. this treatment effectively removed 75 to 80% of the viruses on the cell surface (20 ng of p24/105 cells) after a 2-h binding experiment at 4\u00b0C. after additional washes, cells were disrupted in lysis buffer (PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, 2.5% Triton X-100, and 0.02% thimerosal), and intracellular p24 was evaluated by ELISA (26), with a limit of detection of 31 pg/m macrophages were put in contact with different virus stocks (20 ng of p24/105 cells) at 37\u00b0C to allow for virus internalization (i.e., fusion and endocytosis) after 2 h of incubation, cells were washed and treated with trypsin for 5 min to remove uninternalized viruses from their surface. macrophages (105 cells/well) were seeded on coverslips and then allowed to interact with NL4-3gag-eGFPBalenv (20 ng of p24/105 cells) at 4\u00b0C for 2 h for synchronized viral entry. cells were then washed to remove unbound viruses and transferred to 37\u00b0C to allow for virus internalization. microscope slides were then mounted using fluoromount G microscope. image processing was made using either the Volocity 4.2.1 (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) or NIH ImageJ 1.42 software. each data set was independently analyzed for Gaussian distribution. intracellular p24 was quantified over time by ELISA after cell lysis. results represent mean values of 5 or more independent experiments performed with macrophages derived from different blood donors. cells were pretreated for 30 min with EIPA (25 M), DMA (100 M), or the equivalent amount of DMSO (as vehicle control) before allowing for internalization of NL4-3env/VSV-G (A) or NL4-3Balenv (B) viruses for 2.5 h at 37\u00b0C. after a 5-min trypsin treatment, cell lysis was performed. dimethyl amiloride (DMA), 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride (EIPA) and bafilomycin A1 were all obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) the anti-p24 hybridomas 31-90-25 and 183-H12-5C were respectively obtained from the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. monocytes were separated from other cells, mostly lymphocytes, by adhesion for 2 h at 37\u00b0C in 150- by 20-mm tissue culture dishes followed by washing with endotoxin-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) monocytes were then allowed to differentiate for 4 days in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% autologous plasma, 25 ng/ml macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) the pNL4-3gag-iCFPBalenv construct was obtained by replacing the X4-tropic NL4-3 env gene with that of the bal virus. both pNLC4.3Balenv and pNLC4.3gag-eGFPBalenv were obtained using the same restriction sites. the integrity of all constructs was verified by restriction analysis and by sequencing. reagent induces covalent modification of the free sulfhydryl groups of the cysteines of internal virion proteins, in particular, the nucleocapsid proteins. this inactivation method preserves the structural and functional integrity of Env glycoproteins on the virus surface and therefore has no impact on its interaction with cell surface receptors. a sandwich ELISA previously developed in our laboratory (26) was used to quantify the amount of p24 in each of these viral preparations. the amount of intracellular p24 was normalized on cellular viability measured on drug-treated cells. ultracentrifuged viruses were used to ensure that no free p24 was present in viral preparations. p24 concentrations ranged from 0.2 to 3.6 ng/ml. cells were washed and treated with trypsin for 5 min to remove uninternalized viruses from their surface. cell lysis was performed at time zero and at 1.5 and 3 h. intracellular p24 content was measured at every time point using our in-house ELISA (26) macrophages (105 cells/well) were seeded on coverslips in 24-well plates and then allowed to interact with NL4-3gag-eGFPBalenv (20 ng of p24/105 cells) at 4\u00b0C for 2 h for synchronization of virus entry. cells were then washed to remove unbound viruses and transferred to 37\u00b0C to allow for virus internalization. processing was made using either the Volocity 4.2.1 (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) or NIH ImageJ 1.42 software. each data set was independently analyzed for Gaussian distribution using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality test. asterisks denote statistically significant differences (*, P 0.01; **, P 0.01; **, P 0.01; ***, P 0.001; NS, not significant) compared with DMSO-treated cells. cells were either left untreated (left panel) or pretreated with 100 nM bafilomycin A1 for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. intracellular p24 was quantified by ELISA and normalized for cell viability. results represent mean values of at least 11 independent experiments performed with macrophages derived from different blood donors. CME is not significantly involved in HIV-1 endocytosis in macrophages. intracellular HIV-1 p24 assay allows for quantification of virus internalization. p24 represents both endosomal and cytosolic viral particles at a given time point. however, the assay will detect any significant reduction in HIV-1 endocytosis. this effect was greater for EIPA, with a reduction of 38% compared to 24% with DMA. we tested a fully replicative R5-tropic virus, NL4-3Balenv, in the same assay. however, DMA failed to reduce HIV-1 endocytosis in macrophages. the presence of EIPA reduced the mean intracellular p24 concentration following a 2.5-h virus internalization of either NL4-3env/JRFLenv (1.18 ng/ml for DMSO and 0.92 ng/ml for EIPA) or YU-2 (0.79 ng/ml for DMSO and 0.68 ng/ml for EIPA), confirming our results with the NL4-3Balenv virus. intracellular p24 concentrations measured for NL4-3Balenv in cells treated with DMSO or EIPA were 1.03 ng/ml or 0.77 ng/ml in the absence of MVC. results correspond to reductions of viral internalization in the presence of EIPA of 25% and 16%, respectively, following normalization for cell viability. intracellular p24 measured following endocytosis of NL4-3env virus was greater than that of other viruses (1.0 to 3.2 ng of p24/ml) the amount of intracellular p24 measured following endocytosis was greater than that of other viruses (1.0 to 3.2 ng of p24/ml) this was also expected, as the endocytosis of this virus is known to be very efficient, and its degradation rate is expected to be lower than that of we did detect caveolin-1 RNA transcripts in macrophage preparations. but we were unable to detect the protein by either Western blotting or immunofluorescence microscopy using antibodies from different sources. we then investigated whether CME could be involved in HIV-1 endocytosis in macrophages. treatment with bafilomycin A1, an inhibitor of vesicular H+-ATPase (40), blocks vesicular acidification and should inhibit viral degradation. macrophages were treated with bafilomycin A1 for 30 min or left untreated prior to their contact with NL4-3Balenv, NL4-3env, or NL4-3env/VSV-G viruses and then incubated for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. cells were then imaged every 20 to 30 min. the average virus colocalization with Lysotracker Red-labeled vesicles increased over time, reaching a peak level at 60 min following the temperature shift. this suggests that HIV-1 is transported and degraded in acidified vesicles. cells were imaged for 180 min, and colocalization analysis was performed. the experiment was performed on macrophages derived from 3 different blood donors. the endolysosomal pathway is involved in HIV-1 transport and degradation following endocytosis in macrophages. the loss of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled particles occurred 30 min after the temperature shift, corresponding to peak lamp1 colocalization. this suggests that viral degradation begins when viruses reach Lamp1-positive compartments, corresponding to lysosomes. this suggests that the endolysosomal pathway is involved in HIV-1 transport and degradation following endocytosis in macrophages. two groups have shown that HIV-1 replication is reduced in macrophages infected in the presence of amiloride derivatives such as DMA and EIPA (24, 25) these drugs specifically inhibit macropinocytosis by acting on Na(+)/H(+) exchange and submembranous pH, thereby affecting F-actin remodeling (36). authors concluded that macropinocytosis is involved in HIV-1 infection in such cells. a VSV-G-pseudotyped virus has been shown to exploit macropinocytosis in some cells. both EIPA and DMA reduced VSV-G internalization in macrophages. this effect was greater for EIPA, with a reduction of 38% compared to 24% with DMA. NL4-3env/JRFLenv/JRFLenv and YU-2 (R5-tropic) can bind CD4 and CCR5. NL4-3 (X4-tropic) can bind both CD4 and CXCR4. internalization in the presence of EIPA reduced the mean intracellular p24 concentration following a 2.5-h virus internalization. env internalization was only slightly reduced (0.98 ng/ml, compared to 1.03 ng/ml for DMSO) but the effect of EIPA on NL4-3Balenv internalization was significantly reduced by MVC, while that on NL4-3env/VSV-G was not. intracellular p24 measured following endocytosis of the VSV-G-pseudotyped virus was greater than that of other viruses (1.0 to 3.2 ng of p24/ml) the amount of intracellular p24 measured following endocytosis of the VSV-G-pseudotyped virus was greater than that of other viruses. we investigated which other endocytosis mechanism(s) could be involved in HIV-1 internalization in macrophages. we first discarded caveolin-mediated endocytosis, given that both caveolin-1 RNA transcripts and protein were not detectable in macrophages. however, we were unable to detect the protein by either Western blotting or immunofluorescence microscopy using antibodies from different sources. CPZ had either no effect or slightly increased internalization in macrophages. we adapted our in vitro intracellular p24 assay to follow intracellular p24 in a time course study. in this experiment, treatment with bafilomycin A1 blocks vesicular acidification. alenv and NL4-3env viruses suggest that the great majority of internalized HIV-1 particles are degraded after their internalization in macrophages. however, bafilomycin A1 almost completely inhibited intracellular p24 decrease over time for all the viruses. cells were loaded with 100 nM Lysotracker Red for 1.5 h and then allowed to bind NL4-3gag-iCFPBalenv particles at 4\u00b0C for 2 h for viral entry synchronization. cells were imaged for 180 min, and colocalization analysis was performed. colocalization between HIV-1 and all the endolysosomal markers tested. peak colocalization for EEA1, CD63, and Lamp1 was sequential in time. loss of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled particles occurred 30 min after temperature shift, corresponding to peak lamp1 colocalization. this suggests that viral degradation begins when viruses reach Lamp1-positive compartments, corresponding to lysosomes. ea1 (top panels), CD63 (middle panels), or Lamp1 (bottom panels) at peak of colocalization. three graphs represent colocalization coefficients at different time points for all three endolysosomal markers. total number of fluorescent viral particles detected over time in 12 random fields. DMA reduced VSV-G-pseudotyped virus internalization by only 24% compared to 38% for EIPA. this is much more likely to explain the discrepancy between the effects of DMA on HIV-1 infection and on viral integration presented in their paper. this unique characteristic of macropinocytosis explains its specific disposition for HIV-1 infection in macrophages. it is possible that a variety of receptors are involved in nonproductive internalization of HIV-1 in these cells. it is known that gp120 can bind to a variety of cell surface receptors present at the cell surface. cytosolic p24 represents about 55% of total intracellular p24 in macrophages after a 2-h viral internalization of fusion-competent R5-tropic viruses. cytosolic p24 is likely to be overestimated in this study, as the author showed that 30% of an Env-deficient virus was also detected in the cytosolic fraction. s that were highly positive for Lysotracker Red remained low throughout the experiment. this suggests that HIV-1 does not reach highly acidic compartments. however, a decrease in GFP-positive particle detection was observed only after 30 min of internalization. macropinocytosis offers favorable conditions for FAE. a small number of virus particles may benefit from a slow progression into the endolysosomal pathway."}
