{"summary": "graphical representation of DNA sequences is a kind of alignment-free method. it provides intuitive information of data by visualization of biological sequences. numerous works based on graphical representation have been presented by researchers. in this article, we propose a 3-dimensional (3D) graphic representation of protein sequences based on 10 physicochemical properties17\u201321 of amino acids. the representation can provide good visualization without degeneracy or circuit. then, we extract a specific vector from the graphical curve of a protein sequence. the results are consistent with the evolution fact and works by other researchers.
