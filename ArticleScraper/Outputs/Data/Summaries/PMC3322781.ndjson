{"summary": "the patient was a 40-year-old Chinese man with previously good health. he smoked but did not use alcohol. he was hospitalized in shenzhen and given intravenous antibiotics. sputum and blood samples were taken for routine microscopy. PCRs targeting Chlamydia pneumoniae, Chlamydia. psittaci, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were performed on the sputum sample. adenovirus was detected by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. monolayers were examined daily for cytopathic effect. the growth of influenza A and B, parainfluenza 1, 2, and 3, and adenovirus was examined. hemadsorption test was performed for LLC-MK2 and MDCK monolayers. central lobular hemorrhagic necrosis was noted in the liver. no myocarditis was observed in the kidneys. results of examining other tissues were unremarkable. detached atypical multinucleated pneumocytes indicated by arrow. definite viral inclusion was not apparent (H&E stain, original magnification x400). the nasopharyngeal aspirate collected on admission and the postmortem lung tissue were negative for SARS-CoV by RT-PCR. the postmortem histologic findings were different from the classic picture of virus-associated interstitial pneumonitis. the predominant histologic finding was the presence of fibrin thrombi in small pulmonary arteries. bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia were also detected. a role of HMPV in severe respiratory tract disease should not be discounted. a role of HMPV in severe respiratory tract disease should not be discounted."}
