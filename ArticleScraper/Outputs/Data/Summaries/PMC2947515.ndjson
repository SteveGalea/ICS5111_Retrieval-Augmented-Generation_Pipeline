{"summary": "proteasome inhibitor bortezomib represents an important advance in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) 233 phosphoproteins were identified and 72 phosphoproteins showed a 1.5-fold or greater change upon bortezomib treatment. proteasome activity is a novel therapeutic strategy against cancer cells. bortezomib has been reported to trigger pleiotropic signaling pathways in MM cells. the exact number and identity of signaling events involved in proteasome inhibition remain to be elucidated. SILAC has been widely used in the proteomics community. the entire proteome of a given cell population is metabolically labeled by heavy, non-radioactive variants of amino acids. SILAC has been widely applied to profile dynamic phosphorylation changes in signal transduction. results Quantitative Phosphoproteomic analysis of proteasome inhibition in myeloma cells. we compared the phosphoproteome of cells treated with or without bortezomib. cells grown in normal medium (light culture) were treated with bortezomib. a representative MS/MS spectrum for a phosphosite-containing peptide in the detection is available via the hyperlinks in the Table S1. the application of SILAC in differential phosphoproteomic profiling. dysregulated phosphorylation may play an important role in bortezomib-induced apoptosis. we chose stathmin for Western blotting verification using an anti-phospho-Ser38 stathmin antibody. stathmin was almost unchanged in Western blotting verification. the network was mapped using the STRING system (http://string.embl.de/) based on evidence with different types. different line colors represent the types of evidence for the associations, which are shown in the legend. phosphopeptide library phosphorylation data predict substrates recognized by specific kinases. most of the phosphopeptides determined in this study were phosphorylated by acidophilic serine/threonine kinase and proline-dependent serine/threonine kinase. CK2 is a constitutively active protein kinase implicated in cellular transformation and the development of tumorigenesis. phosphorylation of stathmin at Ser38 increased whereas steady-state stathmin remained unchanged. upregulation of phosphorylation at Ser16 and Ser38 and down-regulation of the phosphorylation at Ser25 were observed in bortezomib-treated cells. the decrease in phosphorylation levels of stathmin was correlated with the inactivation of MAPK, a critical kinase for cell survival. this suggests that the regulation of the phosphorylation profile of stathmin at the level of residues Ser16, Ser25, and Ser38 may participate in the response of myeloma cells to proteasome inhibitors. mutant cells transfected with stathmin were significantly less sensitive to bortezomib lethality than U266 cells. mutant cells were significantly less sensitive to bortezomib lethality. phosphorylation turns off microtubule destabilizing activity of stathmin. bortezomib induced changes in the polymerization status of the MTs in myeloma cells. the baseline proportion of -tubulin in the polymerized fraction ranged from 43% to 52%. the polymerized proportion observed after bortezomib treatment was 60\u201390%. tubulin polymerization in stable U266 clones resulted in a significant decrease in the percent of polymerized tubulin following treatment with bortezomib. bortezomib-treated myeloma cells were treated with or without bortezomib. total 1024 phosphopeptides from the target database passed our criteria. the phosphopeptide false-positive rate was therefore estimated to be 1.4%. multiple filtering criteria were established to validate search results. 131 phosphosites from 75 unique phosphopeptides showed a 1.5-fold or greater change after bortezomib treatment. phosphorylation of stathmin at Ser38 increased, whereas steady-state stathmin remained almost unchanged in Western blotting verification. bortezomib exerts its anticancer function by inhibiting protein degradation in cancer cells [22]. many bortezomib-regulated phosphoproteins found in current study were nucleic acid binding (14%) and transcription factors (4%), as shown in Figure 3A. bortezomib exerts its anticancer function by inhibiting protein degradation in cancer cells. some proteins remained orphans because there is insufficient information in the database to link them to other proteins in the network. bioinformatics analysis was used to distinguish known phosphorylation sites from novel phosphorylation sites. many of the phosphorylation sites were also reported by others previously. SILAC phosphoproteomic analyses and Western blotting revealed an increase of phosphorylation of stathmin at Ser38 and the unchanged steady-state stathmin in U266 cells. it has been reported that the functional alteration of stathmin resulting from specific phosphorylation events may be involved in the process of apoptosis induced by proteasome inhibitors in proliferating cells. ase and ser38 target for cycline-dependent kinase-2 (CDK2) to test activation status of upstream kinases catalyzing incorporation of phosphoryl groups to each of these residues. a parallel activation of CamKII and CDK2 was detected after bortezomib-treated cells. the complete methods and characterization in terms of proliferation, cell cycle, colony-forming efficiency (CFE) and apoptotic ratio of these cells are described in the Supplemental Data S1. aliquots of equal volume were separated by SDS-PAGE. phosphorylation turns off microtubule destabilizing activity of stathmin. proteasome inhibitors increase tubulin polymerization and stabilization in myeloma cells. 0.075 U266-WT 51.24.6 78.65.5 0.005 0.042 U266-S16A 52.53.9 74.17.6 0.007 0.015 U266-S25A 43.68.9 60.85.1 0.011 0.003 U266-S38A 51.67.7 61.88.5 0.047 0.004 *p1: 3 nM bortezomib treated vs. No treatment. a total of 72 phosphoproteins were found to have a 1.5-fold or greater change upon bortezomib treatment (Table S2). according to their change pattern, these DEPPs can be categorized into up- (0.75) or down- (>1.5) regulated groups (Table S2). this unbalanced pattern has also been revealed by previous in vitro biochemical studies. stathmin is a phosphorylation responsive regulator of microtubule dynamics. the regulation of stathmin phosphorylation is complex and multifactorial. it is reasonable to speculate that regulation of stathmin phosphorylation can be achieved by multiple pathways. bortezomib-induced cell death is not completely blocked by the stathmin mutants. bortezomib-induced phosphorylation of stathmin promotes cell death. bortezomib-induced changes in MT stabilization can be attributed to bortezomib-induced phosphorylation of stathmin. BAG3 was found to have increased phosphorylation at Ser377 upon bortezomib treatment. it is involved in a wide variety of cellular processes, including cell survival, cellular stress response, apoptosis and virus replication. recent evidence implicates an additional function of BAG3 in the regulation of the autophagy pathway. bortezomib-induced phosphorylation of BAG3 may play an important role in autophagy activation. the increase in BAG3 phosphorylation is likely part of the cell's response to bortezomib treatment. further investigations are undergoing to determine the functional implication of BAG3 in coordination between the proteasome and autophagy. treptomycin, 1 mmol/L L-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 in air. cells were grown in SILAC RPMI 1640
