{"summary": "the Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease Virus (RHDV) is a positive-strand RNA virus that causes in wild and domestic rabbits an acute highly fatal disease first reported three decades ago. hepatic damage plays a central pathogenic role and is histologically similar to fatal viral hepatitis causing fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) in humans. autophagy activates a molecular complex containing the serine/threonine kinase ULK1. the activation of this complex is down-regulated by mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) the nucleation of the autophagosome membrane is controlled by another molecular complex containing Bcl-2-interacting protein (beclin)-1. ubiquitin-like conjugation systems are involved in the elongation. many viruses, including hepatitis C virus (HCV), dengue virus, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1, have evolved mechanisms to evade autophagy. ER stress is important in maintaining the physiology of healthy cells. it is known that some viruses stimulate signalling pathways from UPR to autophagy. rabbits were kept in the animal facility of the university of le\u00f3n with 12-h light cycle at 21\u201322 \u00b0C and 50% relative humidity. they were given a standard dry rabbit food and water ad libitum. they were injected intramuscularly with 2 104 hemagglutination units of the RHDV isolate AST/89. ultrathin sections (70 nm) were cut with an automatic ultra-microtome (Reichert Ultracut E, Vienna, Austria) using a diamond knife. sections were collected on copper grids (200 meshes) and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate solutions. TEM images were observed under a transmission electron microscope (JEOL Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) operating at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. atg5 TGCTGAAGGCTGTGGGAGAT TGTTCGCTCTCTACAGCCCATTT XM_002714882 417 479 Atg16L1 CCACCAAACCGGCATGAG CTTGCAGCTCTTC XM_002721435.1 190 250 p62/SQSTM1 AACAGAGGTGACCACCCTTCA AGCACAGAAGTC XM_002710315.1 738 798 RHDV T natant fraction was recollected and stored at 80 \u00b0C in aliquots until use. equal amounts of protein extracts (30 g) were separated by 7-12% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred electrically to polyvinyllidene difluoride membranes. membranes were then blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk. the slides were incubated with rabbit anti-VP60 and anti-LC3 antibodies overnight at 4 \u00b0C. they were stained with hematoxylin for 10 s and mounted. pathological findings were assessed by one of the authors blinded to the group allocations. activity expressed as fluorescence units per milligram of protein per min of incubation. results are expressed as mean values standard error of the mean (SEM) data were compared by analysis of variance (ANOVA) the samples were post-fixed in 2% osmium tetroxide for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C. the tissue block was then infiltrated and embedded in epon resin at 60 \u00b0C for 72 h. ultrathin sections (70 nm) were cut with an automatic ultra-microtome. in this study Gene Sense primer (5\u2032-3\u2032) Accession number Fwd start Rev start Beclin-1 CATGCAATGGTGGCTTTCC TCTCGCCCTTTTCAACCTCTT XM_002719409.1 936 994 UVRAG GCGGCGTCTCT GATGGCTTTCTATTAACAATGTT XM_002708684.1 117 178 Atg5 CGTCCTGTGTGTGTGGGAGAT TGTTCGCTCT homogenised in 1 mL from RIPA buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails. further disrupt and homogenize tissue with a manual homogenizer. then the samples were incubated on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged at 13 000 g for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C. immunohistochemistry Tissue samples were recovered, fixed in 10% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. sections were treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide to inactivate endogenous peroxidase activity. the slides were incubated with rabbit anti-VP60 and anti-LC3 antibodies overnight at 4 \u00b0C. EPES buffer containing 100 M concentrations of the specific fluorogenic substrate was monitored using a spectrofluorimeter. activity was expressed as fluorescence units per milligram of protein per min of incubation. results are expressed as mean values standard error of the mean (SEM) VP60 antigen was first detected in hepatocytes from animals killed at 18 hpi. extent of labelling increased markedly at 24 hpi. liver revealed extensive viral VP60 antigen immunolabelling. autophagic structures were present in liver cells from 12 hpi. cytoplasmic biliary necrosis was observed in the periportal rather than centrilobular hepatocytes. bile canalicular microvilli were very swollen and stunted. hepatocytes showed vacuolization of the cytoplasm (black arrows) hepatocytes showed vacuolization of the cytoplasm (black arrows) hepatocytes showed a decrease in the number of hepatocytes. LC3 is a major marker of the autophagosome formation. a significant increase in protein expression of LC3-II was observed at 18 and 24 hpi, with a later decrease at 30 and 36 hpi. TEM studies, LC3 hepatocyte labelling and LC3-II protein expression unequivocally demonstrate that the autophagy was induced at an early stage in rabbits infected with the RHDV. g12-Atg5-Atg16L1 complex is situated in the isolation membrane. results obtained indicate that mRNA levels increase from 12 hpi for Atg12 and Atg5 and from 18 hpi for Atg16L1 reach a maximum at 18 hpi. the beclin-1-PI3K complex is a critical element in the autophagy signalling pathway. levels of mRNA were analyzed by real-time PCR assays. values are expressed as means S.E.M (n = 6), compared with Control. effects of mTOR on pathways regulating autophagy induction. /enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP), immunoglobulin-heavy-chain-binding protein (BiP/GRP78) and glucose-regulated protein 94 (GRP94) results showed a peak of mRNA expression for both chaperones at 24 hpi. p62/SQSTM1 100 4 145 6* 192 8* 202 8* 86 6 69 4* BiP 100 7 118 17 177 41* 304 29* 241 39* 184 18* CHOP 100 8 169 10* 211 19* 540 79* 158 9* 161 13* GRP94 100 4 80 4* 163 5* 412 54* 314 13* 226 21* Levels of mRNA were analyzed by real Western blot analysis showed that at 30 and 36 hpi there was a marked proteolysis of PARP-1 (Figure 5B-C), a nuclear enzyme whose cleavage into a 85-kDA fragment by caspase-3 confirms that cells are undergoing apoptosis [5]. the relative VP60 mRNA expression increased exponentially after 18 hpi in infected hepatocytes. labelling was not found in infected rabbits from the group of animals killed at 12 hpi. autophagy vesicles were detected in hepatocytes by transmision electron microscopy. TEM examination in this study reveals that autophagic structures were present in liver cells from 12 hpi. early disease periods (B-D) showed increased levels of lysosomes and mitochondria. chromatin was condensed and aggregated at the periphery of the nuclear membrane. hepatocytes showed vacuolization of the cytoplasm (black arrows) the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II is a certain and specific marker of autophagy. a significant increase in protein expression of LC3-II was observed at 18 and 24 hpi, with a later decrease at 30 and 36 hpi. mRNA levels increase from 12 hpi for Atg12 and Atg5 and from 18 hpi for Atg16L1. beclin-1-PI3K complex is a critical element in the autophagy signalling pathway. beclin-1-PI3K -mediated autophagy is positively regulated by UVRAG. mRNA and protein expression increased from 12 to 24 hpi. levels of mRNA were analyzed by real-time PCR assays. values are expressed as means S.E.M (n = 6) autophagy plays an important role in maintaining cellular homeostasis through alleviating stress. different transcription factors regulate the expression of ER chaperones that enhance the folding capacity of the ER. hepatic expression of BiP was measured by RT-PCR. 139 7* 87 7 63 5 Atg12 100 9 173 12* 296 41* 177 9* 104 8 82 7 Atg16L1 100 10 106 9 223 6* 140 12* 130 7* 106 10 p62/SQSTM1 100 4 145 6* 192 8* 202 8* 86 6 69 4* BiP 100 7 118 17 177 41* 304 29* 241 39* 184 18* CHOP 100 8 samples were incubated with a specific fluorigenic substrate. cleavage indicated that infection resulted in a marked increase of caspase-3 activity only at 30 and 36 hpi. at later periods of infection there was a marked proteolysis of PARP-1. TEM analysis showed that number and content of autophagy vesicles increased in RHDV-infected livers. p62/SQSTM1 expression increased from 12 hpi and remained elevated until 24 hpi. p62/SQSTM1 expression increased from 12 hpi. upregulated expression of both p62/SQSTM1 and LC3-II has been shown to exist in different types of tumours. p62/SQSTM1 and LC3-II also increases in livers from patients with primary biliary cirrhosis and cultured biliary epithelial cells treated with hydrogen peroxide. p62/SQSTM1 indicates that HCV does not enhance autophagic protein degradation. mTOR activation is necessary for cell growth through regulation of phospho-eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein (EBP)1 [34]. further work would be necessary to identify if there is a similar requirement following infection with the RHDV. autophagy is a cytoprotective mechanism which enables cells to survive unfavourable growth conditions and can prevent cell death by apoptosis. however, some studies have demonstrated that autophagy may have an active contribution to cell death in virus infected cells. inhibition of autophagy effectively suppresses apoptosis induced by the avian influenza A H5N1 virus in mice. autophagy occurs at early stages whereas apoptosis occurs late. apoptotic death of hepatoma cells expressing the oncogenic HBV X protein increases when autophagy is blocked. apoptotic death of hepatoma cells increases when autophagy is blocked. the findings could contribute to the search for new pharmacological strategies to protect livers from FHF injury. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors read and approved the final manuscript."}
