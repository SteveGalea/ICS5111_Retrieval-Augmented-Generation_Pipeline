{"summary": "influenza surveillance at paediatric intensive care units (PICUs) in germany indicated increased incidence of PICU admissions for the pandemic influenza subtype A(H1N1)pdm09. influenza cases among children between 1 month and 16 years of age admitted to these PICUs with acute respiratory infection were confirmed by PCR analysis of respiratory secretions. in season 3, patients with A(H1N1)pdm09 were younger than in season 1 (p = 0.020), were diagnosed more often with bronchitis/bronchiolitis (p = 0.004), and were admitted to a PICU later after the onset of influenza symptoms (p = 0.041). the age shift of severe A(H1N1)pdm09 towards younger children may be explained by increasing immunity in the older paediatric population."}
