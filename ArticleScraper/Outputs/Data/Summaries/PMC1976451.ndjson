{"summary": "CPPPMO conjugates include those with Tat and oligoarginine peptides. oligoarginine peptides containing non-aminohexanoic acid are not stable in human serum. (RXR)4PMO conjugates have been shown to cause effective exon skipping in muscle cells from DMD dogs (8), in human muscle explants (9) and in mdx mice (10), as well as inhibiting the replication of various viruses in cell cultures (7,11\u201313) and in mice (7,13) unnatural amino acids can confer enhanced stability and activity, and therefore improve the potential of CPPs to deliver therapeutic PMO. the antisense PMO (CCT CTT ACC TCA GTT ACA) is designed to target a -thalassemic mutant splice site present in the human -globin intron 2 of a positive-readout antisense activity assay system. the final product contained >90% CPP as determined by HPLC and mass spectrometry analysis. PP conjugated to incomplete PMO sequence, nonconjugated full-length or incomplete PMO. the balance composed of CPP conjugated to incomplete PMO sequence, nonconjugated full-length or incomplete PMO. each peptide had an acetyl group at the N-terminus and a carboxyl group at the C-terminus. cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mM L-Glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) cell viability assay and microscopy pLuc705 cells were seeded 20 h before treatment in 48-well plates at 30 000 cells/well. cells were washed twice with 200 l PBS (HyClone, Ogden, UT) and incubated with 100 l of cell lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) 85% of the media of each well was then replaced with DMSO containing 0.01M HCl. percent cell viability was determined by normalizing the absorbance of each treated sample to the mean of untreated samples. TT ACA is designed to target a -thalassemic mutant splice site present in the human -globin intron 2 of a positive-readout antisense activity assay system. the final product contained >90% CPP conjugated to full-length PMO, with the balance composed of CPP conjugated to incomplete PMO sequence, nonconjugated full-length or incomplete PMO. the sequences of peptides are written from N to C terminus. each peptide had an acetyl group at the N-terminus and a carboxyl group at the C-terminus. cells were seeded 20 h before treatment in 12-well plates at 100 000 cells/well. cells were washed with 500 l of cold PBS, incubated with 400 l of trypsin at 37\u00b0C for 10 min and combined with 500 l of CPPPMO conjugates. luciferase levels were determined by mixing 30 l of cell lysate and 50 l of luciferase assay reagent (Promega) the relative light units (RLU) per sample were normalized to microgram of sample protein. pLuc705 cells were seeded 20 h before treatment in 12-well plates at 100 000 cells/well. cells were treated by removing the medium, washing with 500 l PBS and incubating with medium containing CPPPMO conjugates. trypsin was neutralized with 500 l of the serum containing medium. cells were transferred to the tubes containing previously collected treatment medium. oligoarginine R9PMOF had a mean fluorescence (MF) of 662, nearly 3-fold higher than the 234 produced by R8PMOF. a difference of a single arginine can make a substantial difference in the biological properties of a CPP. cells treated with 2 M of (RXR)4 or R9PMOF in media containing 0, 10, 30 or 60% serum. addition of 10% serum to the medium caused a decrease in the uptake of the R8 or R9PMOF conjugates. increased the uptake of conjugates containing RX, RB or RXR motifs. the luciferase coding sequence was interrupted by the human thalassemic intron 2 which carried a mutated splice site at nucleotide 705. in the pLuc705 system, steric-blocking AOs must be present in the cell nucleus for splicing correction to occur. peptides with 5 or 3 RX or RB repeats, (RX)5, (RX) 3 (RB)5 or (RB)3 generated much lower luciferase activity than those with 8 and 7 repeats. pluc705 cells were treated with the conjugates in OptiMEM medium with or without 10% serum for 24 h. at 2 M, (RX)8PMO (8 X residues) had the highest activity followed by (RXR)4PMO (5 X residues) at 5 M, three conjugates containing 3 (3d), 4 (4c) and 8 ((RX)8) X residues had the highest activities. the position of X residues affects activity. pluc705 cells were treated with the indicated compounds at 1, 2 and 5 M in OptiMEM containing 10% FBS for 24 h. data represent a mean of 9\u201312 samples from four independent experiments. effect of serum on antisense activity of the conjugates depended on the CPP sequences. all conjugates, except (RX)8 and (RXR)4, had no toxicity at up to 60 M. the LD replacement in (RX)8PMO did not change viability profiles of these conjugates. the cell viability is represented as the percent of viable pLuc 705 cells treated at 0, 2, 10, 20, 40 and 60 M of the indicated compounds. pLuc705 cells were treated with the vehicle (No treatment), (RX)8PMO and (RXR)4PMO appeared rounded and detached from the culture well. propidium iodine exclusion assay. PI can only permeate unhealthy/damaged membranes. only (RXR)4 and (RX)8PMO conjugates significantly affect membrane integrity. similar concentration- and time-dependent PI uptake profiles were observed for (RX)8PMO but not for (RB)8PMO and the remaining conjugates. addition of 10% serum to the treatment medium significantly reduced membrane toxicity for the (RXR)4 and (RX)8 PMO conjugates. all treatments were carried out in the presence and absence of 10% FBS. fresh rat red blood cells were treated with the conjugates at 60 M, PBS (background) or 0.005% TX-100 (positive control) the supernatants of conjugate- and PBS-treated samples had small and similar amounts of free hemoglobin released, far lower than that of the TX-100-treated samples. cells were treated with trypsin (19) to remove membrane-bound conjugates. pLuc705 cells were treated with carboxyfluorescein-tagged PMOs. pLuc705 cells were treated with carboxyfluorescein-tagged PMOs. pLuc705 cells were treated with carboxyfluorescein-tagged PMOs. increased the MF of (RX)8, (RXR)4 and (RB)8PMOF from 41, 70 and 60 to 92, 92, 92 and 111, respectively. higher serum concentrations (30 and 60%) decreased the uptake of (RXR)4PMOF and oligoargininePMOF. luciferase activity normalized to protein of cells treated with various conjugates at 1 and 5 M for 24 h. at 5 M, all conjugates generated higher luciferase activity than at 1 M, with (RX)8PMO and (RXR)4PMO again the most effective. nuclear activity of a conjugate is indicated by relative luciferase activity (RLU) per microgram of protein. data represent a mean SD of 6\u20139 data points from three independent experiments. nuclear activity of a conjugate is indicated by relative luciferase activity (RLU) per microgram of protein. data represent a mean SD of 9\u201312 data points from four independent experiments. replacement of the eight l-arginine residues in R8 or (RB)8PMO with D-arginine residues did not change the luciferase activity generated over the 1\u20135 M. the addition of 10% serum nearly doubled the luciferase activity of (RXR)4, (RX)8 and (RB)8PMO at 5 M. we further studied this effect for (RXR)4PMO up to 60% serum. this \u2018up and down\u2019 profile was also observed with the 1 M (RXR)4PMO treatment. all conjugates generated higher luciferase activity than at 1 M. the peptides with 5 or 3 RX or RB repeats, (RX)5, (RX) 3 (RB)5 or (RB)3, generated much lower luciferase activity than those with 8 and 7 repeats. at 2 M, (RX)8PMO (8 X residues) had the highest activity followed by (RXR)4PMO (5 X residues) at 5 M, three conjugates containing 3 (3d), 4 (4c) and 8 ((RX)8) X residues had the highest activities. the position of X residues affects activity. pluc705 cells were treated with the indicated compounds at 1, 2 and 5 M in OptiMEM containing 10% FBS for 24 h. luciferase activity of (RXR)4PMO or R9PMO only decreased as the serum concentration increased. pLuc705 cells were treated at concentrations ranging from 2 to 60 M for 24 h. all conjugates, except (RX)8 and (RXR)4, had no toxicity at up to 60 M. the LD replacement in (RX)8PMO decreased the toxicity. we found that only (RXR)4PMO caused dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation while other two conjugates had no toxicity up to 60 M. the cell viability is represented as the percent of viable pLuc 705 cells treated at 0, 2, 10, 20, 40 and 60 M of the indicated compounds. pLuc705 cells were treated with the vehicle (No treatment), (RX)8PMO, (rX)8PMO, (RXR)4PMO or (RXR)3RBRPMO (4c) at 60 M in OptiMEM. only (RXR)4 and (RX)8PMO conjugates were found to significantly affect membrane integrity at higher concentrations. similar concentration- and time-dependent PI uptake profiles were observed for (RX)8PMO but not for (RB)8PMO and the remaining conjugates. added 10% serum to the treatment medium significantly reduced membrane toxicity for the (RXR)4 and (RX)8 PMO conjugates. all treatments were carried out in OptiMEM in the presence and absence of 10% FBS. (RXR)4 and (RX)8PMO conjugates were tested in a hemolysis assay. the supernatants of conjugate- and PBS-treated samples had small and similar amounts of free hemoglobin released. all conjugates, except (RX)8 and (RXR)4, had no toxicity at up to 60 M. we found that only (RXR)4PMO caused dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation while other two conjugates had no toxicity up to 60 M. the cell viability is represented as the percent of viable pLuc 705 cells treated at 0, 2, 10, 20, 40 and 60 M of the indicated compounds. pLuc705 cells were treated with the vehicle (No treatment), (RX)8PMO, (rX)8PMO, (RXR)4PMO or (RXR)3RBRPMO (4c) at 60 M for 0.5, 5 and 24 h. only (RXR)4 and (RX)8PMO conjugates were found to significantly affect membrane integrity at higher concentrations. at higher concentrations, the PI+ population appeared and the percentage of PI+ cells increased as the treatment concentration increased. similar concentration- and time-dependent PI uptake profiles were observed for (RX)8PMO but not for (RB)8PMO and the remaining conjugates. added 10% serum to the treatment medium significantly reduced membrane toxicity for the (RXR)4 and (RX)8 PMO conjugates. hemolysis assay The (RXR)4 and (RX)8PMO conjugates were tested in a hemolysis assay and found to be compatible with red blood cells. fresh rat red blood cells were treated with the conjugates at 60 M, PBS (background) or 0.005% TX-100 (positive control) despite lower cellular uptake of X/B-containing CPP\u2013PMO, they generated higher antisense activities in the cell nucleus than oligoargininePMO. we hypothesize that X/B-containing conjugates have a greater ability to escape from endosomes/lysosomes than oligoarginine conjugates. ine, or X- and B-containing conjugates caused a small but statistically significant decrease in activity. difference between results may be due to the type and size of cargos and the cell lines used for the assays. it is possible that the CPP portion was degraded into free amino acids and/or smaller peptide fragments which were toxic. however, our investigation revealed that neither free R nor X, alone or in combination, caused cellular toxicity. this explanation does not account for the difference in toxicity observed between (RX)8PMO and (rX)8PMO. the X/B-containing CPPPMO conjugates are superior to oligoargininePMO conjugates. they display higher activity in cell nuclei, are less affected by serum and are more stable in blood. the toxicity of the X/B-containing CPPs can be reduced by keeping the number of X residues below 5 while still maintaining a reasonable delivery efficacy and stability."}
