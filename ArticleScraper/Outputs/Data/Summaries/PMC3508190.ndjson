{"summary": "rats were housed on 1/4-in. corncob bedding in static, polysulfone, microisolation cages. rats were kept in a conventional, AAALAC-accredited facility with a HEPA-filtered air supply, 12:12-h light:dark cycle. rats were anesthetized with isoflurane gas by using a lab research anesthesia system (SurgiVet, Waukesha, WI) rats were anesthetized with isoflurane gas by using 4% to 5% isoflurane delivered in 100% oxygen (1 L/min) inside the attached chamber. rats were kept warm by using a recirculating-water heating blanket. they recovered inside their cages while being placed half on, half off of the recirculating-water heating blanket. the rats were weighed for baseline evaluations. positive and negative control monitors below the test panels were tested in a similar manner. tests with an obvious blue color were recorded as positive; equivocal or trace reactions were deemed negative. blood sampling and measurement of PCV and total protein concentration. weighed by using a digital baby scale (Tanita, Arlington Heights, IL) before providing them to rats. five days later, before preexperimental blood draws, the remaining food was weighed. body weights were measured (in grams) by using the same baby scale at 10 d after arrival. two 5-m, serial sections were applied to a single glass slide per intestinal roll and stomach for each rat. the slides were examined in a blinded fashion by a board-certified veterinary pathologist using a microscope (BX40, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) group of 14 or 7 female rats were singly housed and allowed to acclimate for 10 d before being handled for baseline evaluations. rats were kept in a conventional, AAALAC-accredited facility with a HEPA-filtered air supply. rats were injected in the dorsal rump area with ketoprofen (5 mg/kg SC) without subsequent anesthesia. rats were euthanized with CO2 gas at 24 h after these experimental manipulations. rats were anesthetized with isoflurane gas by using a lab research anesthesia system (SurgiVet, Waukesha, WI) anesthesia was induced by using isoflurane delivered in 100% oxygen (1 L/min) through a diaphragm-covered nose cone. two drops of the developer, which consisted of 6% hydrogen peroxide, were applied to each panel. after 30 s, the panels were observed for the development of a blue color, which indicated a positive reaction. positive and negative control monitors below the test panels were tested in a similar manner. rodent chow pellets were placed into a stainless steel bowl and weighed (in grams) by using a digital baby scale (Tanita, Arlington Heights, IL) before providing them to rats. five days later, before preexperimental blood draws, the remaining food was weighed. twenty-four hours later, during postexperimental evaluations, the remaining pellets were weighed. two 5-m, serial sections were applied to a single glass slide per intestinal roll and stomach for each rat. the severity of mucosal erosions and ulcerations was graded according to 5-point scales. arcsine-transformed to compare groups by using 2-tailed, repeated-measures ANOVA. the remaining continuous variables were compared directly by using 2-tailed, repeated-measures ANOVA. the threshold for statistical significance for all analyses was set at a P of less than 0.05.

PCV, 15% below baseline; total protein, 3.7 g/dL below baseline. the only lesion found in group S+A was a minimal ulcer located in the duodenum of a single rat. of the 11 ulcers found in rats in group K+A, 73% (8) were located in the jejunum and 27% (3) were in the ileum. 55% (6) of the total ulcers were grade 1, 18% (2) were grade 2, and 27% (3) were grade 3. 0 0 duodenum 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 ileum 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 total no. of lesions 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 (8) were in the jejunum, 8% (1) were in the ileum, 25% (3) were in the stomach. 50% (6) of the total erosions were grade 1, 25% (3) were grade 2, 17% (2) were grade 3, and 8% (1) were grade 4. post hoc comparisons could not detect differences between subgroups. body weights in all 3 groups had been increasing by a daily average of 3.3 g (95% CI, 2.5 to 4 g), 3.1 g (95% CI, 2 to 4 g), and 3.7 g (95% CI, 3 to 4.4 g) in groups K+A, S+ A, and K, respectively, during the 5-d preexperimental period. there was no linear relationship between body weight at time 0 and 24-h measurement for PCV for all 3 groups no significant difference between the positive FOBT in groups K+A and K (P = 0.487) PCV showed a significant difference among the 3 groups at 24 h (P = 0.039, repeated-measures ANOVA; Figure 2). three rats in this group showed declines of 1% to 5%. 75% of the PCV values in this group increased by 1% to 7%. the mean total protein concentration declined in groups K+A and K but increased in group S+A. total protein dropped by 1.1 to 6.2 g/dL (95% CI, 5.7 to 6.7 g/dL) in group K+A, total protein fell by 0.9 to 6.3 g/dL. 85% of the values fell by 0.2 to 4.6 g/dL, with 10 rats showing decreases. intestines from rat 49, group K, 24 h after ketoprofen injection. thin arrow points to darkened intestinal loops, indicative of blood in the lower intestines. there was no statistical difference between the numbers of rats with ulcers in group K+A compared with group K (2, 0.1; df, 1; P = 0.7518). Ulcers of grades 1 through 3 were observed throughout the small intestines of groups K+A and K, with most ulcers located in the jejunum. no regional bias was apparent along the length of the jejunum. 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 of the 18 erosions found in group K+A, 9 (50%) were located in the jejunum. 3 (17%) were in each of the ileum, duodenum, and stomach. 44% (8) of the total erosions were grade 1, 39% (7) were grade 2, and 17% (3) were grade 3. there was a significant (P = 0.049) difference in mean food intake among the groups. data are expressed as mean values with bounds of their respective 95% confidence intervals (n = 20 per group) a related aim was to determine whether anesthesia combined with ketoprofen in rats was more deleterious to the gastrointestinal tract than was ketoprofen administered without subsequent anesthesia. the results confirmed our primary hypothesis and suggested that the combination of anesthesia and ketoprofen in rats may be more toxic to the gastrointestinal tract than is ketoprofen treatment alone. anesthetic-related hypotension8,31 contributed to ketoprofen-induced gastrointestinal toxicity due to reduced perfusion of the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys. this effect could have led to higher blood levels of the drug and diminished washout from the gastrointestinal mucosa. rats with intestinal ulcers in the K+A and K groups were nearly equal. the majority of the stools for the experimental groups were dark, reddish brown, indicative of bleeding in the lower gastrointestinal tract. the 2 positive FOBT observed in group S+A may reflect effects of anesthesic stress. normal jejunum, rat 18, group S+A, 24 h after ketoprofen injection. arrows indicate denuded mucosal surface. arrows indicate denuded mucosal surface. a drop in serum proteins increases the levels of unbound drug. a positive feedback loop of intestinal mucosal damage, loss of serum proteins, and ensuing higher drug availability may have occurred in the most severe cases in groups K+A and K. study found fewer gastrointestinal tract lesions in fed rats treated with a nonselective NSAID compared with the number of gastric lesions in fasted rats that underwent the same treatment. group K+A showed the largest decline, in line with their other generally worse clinical signs. studies contend that an important mechanism of nonselective NSAID-induced damage to the intestinal tract involves increased intestinal mucosal permeability. recirculation of the drug through the bile in the intestinal tract would prolong mucosal exposure to the toxic effects of the drug. a single, therapeutic dose of ketoprofen (5 mg/kg SC) causes significant gastrointestinal bleeding, erosions, and ulcers of the small intestines of rats within 24 h after administration. the toxic effects of ketoprofen were evident in anesthetized and unanesthetized rats."}
