{"summary": "autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved and genetically controlled cellular response to nutrient deprivation that is found in yeast, plants, worms, flies, mice, and humans. autophagy is characterized by formation of double-membrane vesicles (autophagosomes) in the cytosol that first engulf organelles and cytoplasm and then fuse with the lysosomes to form the autolysosomes. autophagy is induced by a wide range of intracellular stresses to degrade protein aggregates, oxidized lipids, damaged organelles, and even intracellular pathogens. accumulating evidence has pointed to the importance and functional role of autophagy in various human diseases. in recent years, accumulating evidence has pointed to the importance and functional role of autophagy in various human diseases. autophagy modulators may lead to a new generation of therapeutic agents for the treatment of various human diseases. aim is to show how autophagy modulators may lead to a new generation of therapeutic agents for the treatment of various human diseases. mTOR is activated and inhibits autophagy through repression of ULK1 activity. growth factors such as insulin or insulin-like growth factor can activate the class I PI3K-Akt/PKB pathway. microautophagy involves the sequestration of intracellular components by the lysosome through invagination of the lysosomes. elongation/enclosure, the phagophore membrane elongation and fusion of its edges to form the autolysosome. third is degradation of the sequestered materials for recycling and energy production. cytosolic proteins are recognized by heat-shock cognate protein (HSC70) microautophagy involves direct internalization of cytoplasmic materials into the lysosome. cellular constituents are sequestrated into the lysosomal lumen for degradation through invagination of the lysosomal membrane. excessive autophagy can cause nonapoptotic programmed cell death. autophagy participates in maintaining cellular homeostasis by degrading and recycling unnecessary or excessive cellular components. autophagy may result in accumulation of abnormal and misfolded protein aggregates. autophagy also involved in monitoring the quality of important organelles. atg11, Atg32, and Atg8 have been identified as critical regulators of mitophagy. autophagy also plays critical roles in development and differentiation. autophagy can affect embryogenesis, including midembryonic development. autophagy-defective cells fail to maintain physiologic levels of amino acid. autophagy-defective cells fail to maintain physiologic levels of amino acid. autophagy-defective cells fail to maintain physiologic levels of amino acid. plants with mutant autophagy genes show defects in development, including accelerated senescence and enhanced chlorosis. the postnatal survival time of the starved mice deficient for Atg5 was less than 12 hours but was prolonged by forced milk feeding. cellular autophagy also plays a cytoprotective or prosurvival role under stressful conditions. autophagic cell death was observed in tumor cells treated with chemopreventive or chemotherapeutic agents such as resveratrol (Opipari et al., 2004), arsenic trioxide (Kanzawa et al., 2003), and tamoxifen (Bursch et al., 1996) support for the role of autophagy in cell death was provided via the use of autophagy inhibitors. inhibition of caspase arrests apoptosis but activates autophagic cell death. autophagy-associated cell death can be revealed when apoptosis is blocked. more than 30 autophagy-related genes (Atg) have been identified in yeast. all the Atg proteins found in yeast have mammalian homologs. all the Atg proteins found in yeast have mammalian homologs. atg13 promotes the formation of the Atg1-Atg1 self-interaction complex. atg13 promotes the formation of the atg1-Atg1 self-interaction complex. the complex is conserved in various eukaryotes. at least three Atg8 homologs in mammalian cells are cleaved by ATP hydrolysis. light chain 3 (LC3) is cleaved by Atg4 to form the cytosolic soluble soluble soluble soluble soluble soluble soluble soluble soluble soluble soluble soluble soluble soluble soluble soluble soluble soluble soluble soluble. LC3-II is cleaved and converted to membrane-associated form LC3-II. lysosome-associated membrane protein p62/SQSTM1 binds directly to LC3 via sequence motif. p62/SQSTM1 decreases when autophagy is activated, thus p62 is often used as a marker for autophagic flux. signaling pathway regulates autophagy when activated by nutrients, growth factors, or hormones such as insulin. mTOR is present in two structurally and functionally distinct protein complexes known as mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTOR is downstream of PI3K and is activated in response to mitogenic stimuli or nutrient availability. kinases further recruit and activate the class I PI3K-Akt/PKB. phosphorylates and inhibits the receptor tyrosine kinase. AMPK can be phosphorylated and activated. activation of AMPK phosphorylates and activates TSC1/2, leading to inactivation of mTOR and induction of autophagy. AMPK can also cause inactivation of mTOR by directly phosphorylating the mTOR binding partner Raptor. the human homolog of Atg13 is also a direct substrate for mTOR. mTORC1 inactivates ULK1 by phosphorylating this protein. eEF2K catalyzes phosphorylation of eEF-2, a 100-kDa protein involved in the translocation step in peptide-chain elongation. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a chief sensor of cellular energy. it regulates the metabolism of glucose and lipids in response to alterations in nutrient and intracellular ATP concentrations. AMPK is activated when intracellular AMP/ATP ratio increases. AMPK-mediated suppression of mTOR is controlled by TSC2 and Raptor. AMPK binds to the N-terminal proline/serine domain of ULK1. AMPK also participates in regulation of other cellular functions. AMPK-dependent phosphorylation of ULK1 is important for ULK1 regulation of ATG9 localization. AMPK promotes autophagy by directly phosphorylating ULK1 on ser317 and Ser777, thus activating ULK1. antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members also inhibit autophagy. BH3 domain inhibits beclin1-dependent autophagy. other proteins with BH3 domains can competitively disrupt the association between Beclin-1 and Bcl-2/Bcl-XL. p53 activates autophagy by inhibiting mTOR in an AMPK-dependent and TSC1/TSC2-dependent manner. sestrin 1 and sestrin 2, two p53 target genes, have been identified as a critical link between p53 activation and mTOR inhibition. thus, p53 can modulate autophagy in dual ways, depending on its cellular localization. mTOR is activated and inhibits autophagy through repression of ULK1 activity. growth factors such as insulin or insulin-like growth factor can activate the class I PI3K-Akt/PKB pathway. microautophagy involves the sequestration of intracellular components by the lysosome through invagination of the lysosome. cytosolic proteins are recognized by heat-shock cognate protein (HSC70), a 70-kDa chaperone that mediates the translocation of proteins to the surface of the lysosomes. this particular pentapeptide consensus motif is the only binding region recognized specifically by HSC70 for protein delivery to the lysosome. CMA involves recognition of the KFERQ region of cytosolic proteins by HSC70. substrate proteins are binding to the cytosolic tail of LAMP-2A. substrate degradation and LAMP-2A dissociation into monomers. autophagy is evolutionarily conserved in eukaryotes from yeast to mammals. autophagy is the major pathway for degradation of short-lived proteins. autophagy is responsible for degradation of long-lived proteins and other cellular contents. autophagy is also involved in monitoring the quality of important organelles such as the mitochondria. autophagy is a process termed \"mitophagy\" in rat hepatocytes. nutrient deprivation initiates mitochondrial depolarization and subsequent sequestration of the mitochondria into autophagosomes. molecular mechanisms of mitophagy remain incompletely understood. autophagy-dependent cellular survival occurs with different types of stress. nutrient starvation can induce autophagy in yeast, plant cells, mammalian cells, and whole animals. autophagy-defective cells fail to maintain physiologic levels of amino acid. the impaired protein synthesis in the mutant yeast cells was much more severe than in the wild-type cells during starvation. plants with mutant autophagy genes show defects in development. postnatal survival time of the starved mice deficient for Atg5 was less than 12 hours but was prolonged by forced milk feeding. autophagic cell death often occurs when groups of cells or entire tissues die during development. more recently, autophagic cell death was observed in tumor cells treated with chemopreventive or chemotherapeutic agents. studies also showed that knockdown of some key autophagy genes can reduce cell death. nonapoptotic cell death induced by z-VAD, a caspase inhibitor, decreased when cells were cotreated either with the autophagy inhibitors 3-MA and wortmannin. inhibition of caspase arrests apoptosis but activates autophagic cell death. autophagy can be revealed when apoptosis is blocked. autophagy-dependent cellular homeostasis can occur due to autophagy alone. there are two known cellular mechanisms for protein degradation. the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is responsible for degradation of short-lived proteins. atg5-deficient mice display disorganized sarcomere structure. mitochondrial misalignment and aggregation can be selectively removed by autophagy. selective degradation of mitochondria by mitophagy is vital for cellular homeostasis. autophagy enables cells to undergo structural remodeling. autophagy contributes to cellular differentiation during erythropoiesis, lymphopoiesis, and adipogenesis. nutrient starvation can induce autophagy in yeast, plant cells, mammalian cells, and whole animals. the amino acids and fatty acids generated through autophagy can be used by the tricarboxylic acid cycle to maintain ATP production in the mitochondria. the impaired protein synthesis in the Atg7 mutant yeast cells was much more severe than in the wild-type cells during starvation. in yeast, autophagy-defective cells are susceptible to starvation-induced damage. autophagic vacuoles containing organelles such as mitochondria were first observed in dying animal cells. this area of investigation is confounded by the possibility that the appearance of autophagy in dead or dying cells is an unsuccessful cellular attempt at survival. studies found that autophagy often occurs when groups of cells or entire tissues die during development. inhibition of autophagy by the small-interfering RNA against Atg7 or Atg9 decreases the sensitivity of the tumor cells to STF-62247. inhibition of caspase arrests apoptosis but activates autophagic cell death. some studies suggest inhibition of autophagy may result in either delayed or partial inhibition rather than prevention of cell death. the question of whether cell death can truly occur due to autophagy alone remains to be clarified. all these proteins are present in the beclin1-regulated autophagy protein 1 (AMBRA1) when it binds to Beclin1 it reduces the activity of Vps34 and impairs the formation of autophagosome. Atg1 plays a key role in the early stage of autophagy by forming a complex with Atg13 and Atg17. ubiquitin-like system, Atg12 is conjugated to Atg5 through Atg7 and Atg10. the E1-like Atg7 binds to the C-terminal glycine of Atg12 through its active cysteine site to form an intermediate complex via a thioester bond. atg8-PE can be detected on both of the intermediate vesicle and the completed autophagosome. light chain 3 (LC3) is cleaved by Atg4 to form the cytosolic soluble LC3-I. LC3-II remains on the mature autophagosomes until fusion with lysosomes is completed. p62/SQSTM1 (sequestosome 1) binds directly to LC3 via a specific sequence motif. p62/SQSTM1 decreases when autophagy is activated. p62 is often used as a marker for autophagic flux. mTOR regulates various cellular functions such as energy metabolism. mTORC1 is downstream of PI3K and is activated in response to mitogenic stimuli or nutrient availability. growth factors such as insulin and insulin-like growth factor bind to receptor tyrosine kinases, leading to autophosphorylation of these receptor substrates. activation of receptor tyrosine kinase stimulates PI3K/Akt and Ras. Akt inhibits PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling and is an autophagy-promoting signal. AMPK can also cause inactivation of mTOR by directly phosphorylating the mTOR binding partner Raptor. activated mTORC1 induces the phosphorylation of Atg13 and prevents its association with Atg1. mTORC1 inactivates ULK1 by phosphorylating this protein. eEF2K catalyzes phosphorylation of eEF-2, a 100-kDa protein involved in the translocation step in peptide-chain elongation. elongation occurs when energy is deficient, the activity of mTOR is decreased, and eEF2K is activated. eEF2k can act as a positive regulator of autophagy under environmental or metabolic stresses, including nutrient deprivation. native 1-subunit of AMPK is phosphorylated at three sites. mutations on ser24/Ser25, ser108, and ser182 have no effect on enzyme activity. AMPK-mediated suppression of mTOR is controlled by TSC2 and Raptor. AMPK binds to the N-terminal proline/serine domain of ULK1. this interaction is required for the ULK1-mediated autophagy. AMPK-dependent phosphorylation of ULK1 is important for ULK1 regulation of ATG9 localization. antiapoptotic proteins such as BNIP3L, Bad, Noxa, Puma, BimEL22, and Bik stimulate autophagy. other proteins with BH3 domains can competitively disrupt the association between Beclin-1 and Bcl-2/Bcl-XL and induce autophagy. p53 activates autophagy by inhibiting mTOR in an AMPK-dependent and TSC1/TSC2-dependent manner. p53 activates autophagy through transcriptional regulation. cytoplasmic p53 inhibits autophagy in the same cells. beclin1, the mammalian homolog of yeast autophagy gene Atg6, was the first identified autophagy gene in mammalian cells. the initiation step of autophagosome formation requires the Beclin1-class III PI3K complex. all these proteins are present in the Vps34 complex and act as inducers of autophagy. atg13 promotes the formation of the Atg1-Atg1 self-interaction complex. the complex is correlated with the kinase activity of Atg1 and the amount of autophagy. atg8 was recently identified as a regulator of Atg1, which directly binds to Atg1. the second conjugation system involves the cleavage and lipidation of Atg8. Atg8 is cleaved near the C-terminal glycine residue by the cysteine protease Atg4, is activated by the E1-like Atg7. it then is conjugated to the lipid PE. p62/SQSTM1 (sequestosome 1), an ubiquitin-binding scaffold protein, binds directly to LC3 via a specific sequence motif and is degraded by the autophagic process. p62/SQSTM1 decreases when autophagy is activated, thus p62 is used as a marker for autophagic flux. mTOR is present in two structurally and functionally distinct protein complexes known as mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTOR consists of mTOR, mLST8 (mammalian lethal with SEC13 protein 8), Raptor (regulatory-associated protein of mTOR), PRAS40 (proline-rich Akt substrate of 40 kDa) and DEPTOR (DEP domain containing mTOR-interacting protein) phosphorylation allows Rheb-GTP to accumulate and activate mTOR. phosphoinositide-3 phosphatase antagonizes the signaling of the Akt/PKB pathway. activation of PI3K indirectly regulates AKT (protein kinase B) cytoplasmic p53 is responsible for the inhibition of autophagy. proapoptotic proteins exert inhibitory effects on autophagy. mTORC1 inhibits the association between Atg1 and Atg13. factor 2 kinase (eEF2K) catalyzes the phosphorylation of eEF-2, a 100-kDa protein involved in the translocation step in peptide-chain elongation. eEF2K is controlled by mTOR and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) when energy is abundant, eEF2K is inhibited by the activity of mTOR and protein elongation occurs. AMPK is activated when the intracellular AMP/ATP ratio increases. liver kinase B1 (LKB1), the major upstream activating kinase of AMPK, ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase--activated kinase--activated kinase- (TAK1) are major kinases that phosphorylate AMPK on Thr172 and cause activation of AMPK-mediated suppression of mTOR is controlled by TSC2 and Raptor. AMPK directly phosphorylates TSC2 on T1227 and S1345 and enhances the functions of TSC2. AMPK can regulate the mTOR signaling by directly phosphorylating the mTOR binding partner Raptor on two conserved serine residues. AMPK promotes autophagy by directly phosphorylating ULK1 on Ser317 and Ser777, thus activating ULK1. dephosphorylation of ULK1 leads to its dissociation from AMPK. antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins also inhibit autophagy. p53 is a transcription factor that transactivates proapoptotic and cell cycle\u2013arresting genes. it is frequently inactivated or mutated in cancer cells. it has been found that inactivation of p53 can trigger autophagy in vitro and in vivo. p53 activates autophagy through transcriptional regulation. cytoplasmic p53 inhibits autophagy. mTOR regulates various cellular functions such as energy metabolism. downstream of PI3K and is activated in response to mitogenic stimuli or nutrient availability. growth factors such as insulin and insulin-like growth factor bind to receptor tyrosine kinases, leading to autophosphorylation of these receptors.
