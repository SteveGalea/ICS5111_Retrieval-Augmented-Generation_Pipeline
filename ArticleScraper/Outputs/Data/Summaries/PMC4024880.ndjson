{"summary": "Purified Spike-containing paramagnetic proteoliposomes and Spike-expressing 293 T cells were used to select Abs from the mehta I/II nonimmune human single-chain variable domain fragment (scFv)-phage libraries. a total of 1,344 clones were screened to verify their binding to S1 and S2 fused with constant region fragment of human IgG (hFc) 9 and 1F8 Abs use VH3-30 and VH1-3 and have 10 and 9 substitutions. the lengths of the VH complementarity-determining region 3 vary from 11 to 19 amino acids. anti-Flag biosensor capturing S1(349\u2013590)-hFc initially was saturated with one Ab, and additional binding with another Ab was evaluated. results indicate that 1E9 can block the binding of 1F8 and 3A1 completely and can block 3B12 and M14D3 partially. all Abs had nanomolar to subnanomolar binding affinity to S1(349\u2013590) conversion of three of the seven scFvFcs (3A1, 3B12, and M14D3) to IgG1 resulted in 11- to 34-fold higher Kd values. 3B11 exhibited the best pseudovirus neutralization activity in both the scFvFc and IgG1 formats. all scFvFcs strongly neutralized MERS-CoV with varying degrees of efficiency. six of seven scFvFcs neutralized MERS-CoV completely at concentrations 20 g/mL. three IgG1 Abs also tested for live virus neutralization. 3B11 had a lower IC50 value than 1F8 and 3A1 IgGs. hDPP4 and scFvFcs could block hDPP4 binding to the RBD. hDPP4 also could block all seven scFvFcs from binding to S1(349\u2013590) control scFvFc, F10, did not inhibit S1(349\u2013590)-hFc binding to 293T-hDPP4 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Fig. S5B shows that all scFvFcs could inhibit the attachment of MERS S pseudovirus to hDPP4-expressing cells. the structure was adapted from protein Dana Bank ID code 4KR0. the RBM (amino acids 484\u2013567) is colored in purple. the receptor-binding core is colored in light blue. the hDPP4 is colored gray. eight escape mutants had IC50 values of 20 g/mL. only Em3B11-Fc achieved an IC50 value of 6.76 g/mL. mutant viruses were assigned to three epitope groups. 3B11-Fc (a group 3 escape virus) could neutralize Em3C12-Fc (a group 3 escape virus) at a much higher Ab concentration (IC50 = 8.94 vs. 1.83 for wild type) 3C12-Fc (a group 3 escape virus) could neutralize Em3B11-Fc (a group 3 escape virus) at a much higher Ab concentration (IC50 = 13.8 vs. 2.0 for wild type) each purified RBD mutant was serially diluted 2 (12 dilutions starting from 5 or 20 g/mL) and then incubated with 1 105 293T-hDPP4 cells. binding of the mutant proteins was monitored with APC-Cy7\u2013labeled anti-hFc Abs. Fc had two- to fivefold reductions in titer, and Em1E9-Fc had a slightly increased viral titer. this results suggest that most of the escape mutations resulted in impaired fitness. we compared contact changes between the RBD and hDPP4 before and after neutralization escape. Y540C and R542G substitutions resulted in a net of four and 11 decreases in VDW contacts between the RBD and hDPP4. a total of 1,344 clones were screened to verify their binding to S1 and S2 fused with constant region fragment of human IgG (hFc) five of seven VH chains belong to one gene family, IGHV1-69. these segments show very low levels of somatic hypermutation (SHM) ranging from zero (3B12, 3B11) to only five (3A1, 3C12) amino acid substitutions. all seven scFvFcs recognized S1(349\u2013751)-hFc and S1(349\u2013590)-hFc but not S1(21\u2013358)-hFc. results demonstrate that the epitopes of all seven Abs lie within the 349\u2013590 amino acid fragment of the S protein, which contains the RBD of MERS-CoV. epitope 2 Abs most likely is centrally, whereas epitopes 1 and 3 are flanking. all Abs had nanomolar to subnanomolar binding affinity to S1(349\u2013590) all Abs had lower Kd values than their scFvFc counterparts. 3B11 exhibited the best pseudovirus neutralization activity in both the scFvFc and IgG1 formats. 3B11 exhibited the best pseudovirus neutralization activity in both the scFvFc and IgG1 formats. all scFvFcs strongly neutralized MERS-CoV with varying degrees of efficiency. Abs 3B11, 3A1, 3B12, and 3C12 were very strong neutralizers. the other three neutralized the virus with IC50 values of 3.21, 4.3, and 6.27 g/mL. 3A1, 3B12, and M14D3 IgGs had lower neutralization activities than their scFvFcs, in agreement with their lower binding affinities. so, as expected, virus neutralization potency was positively correlated with nAb binding affinity, with 3B11 the most potent nAb in both formats. all scFvFcs could inhibit 50 nM S1(349\u2013590)-hFc binding to 293T-hDPP4 cells in a dose-dependent manner. the control scFvFc, F10, did not inhibit S1(349\u2013590)-hFc binding to 293T-hDPP4 cells in a dose-dependent manner. escape mutations confirmed the presence of three epitopes. Ab 1F8, 3A1, and 3B12 bind to amino acids in the center of the RBM. 1E9 binds to epitope 1, and 3B11, 3C12, and M14D3 bind to another flanking epitope, epitope 3. binding affinity for all Abs fell below the level of Octet detection. 1E9 maintains good binding affinity with both the Y540C mutant and the L506F and Y540C mutants. all escape mutants clearly escaped from their parent Abs. 3B11-Fc and 3C12-Fc (group 3 Abs) still could neutralize escape viruses from group 1 (Em1E9-Fc) and group 2 (Em1F8-Fc) Abs. 3C12-Fc neutralizes Em1F8-Fc with an approximately sixfold higher IC50 (11.7 g/mL) all seven mutated RBDs can bind to 293T-hDPP4 cells with varying efficacy. the P547S mutation did not change RBD binding to hDPP4 cells. however, the L506F single substitution caused an approximately threefold higher 50% effective concentration (EC50) than the wild-type RBD. all six neutralization escape viruses grew in vero cells, reaching peak titers of 106\u2013108 pfu/mL by 36 h after infection. escape mutants Em3B11-Fc and Em3A1-Fc had 1- to 2-log reductions in titer at 12\u201336 h after infection, compared with the wild-type virus. the T512 side chain does form an important hydrogen bond with D509. this hydrogen bond is lost with the T512A substitution, along with a 25% loss of other internal loop contacts. these atomic changes may alter the local conformation of the RBD, resulting in a decrease in hDPP4 binding. the basis and biases of human nAbs against MERS-CoV may contribute to MERS-CoV clearance and evolution. we used mammalian cell-produced full-length S protein expressed on PMPLs and cell surfaces for Ab panning. all Abs identified were directed to the RBD and have potent neutralizing activity. five of seven Abs use the IGHV1-69 germ-line gene that is preferentially used by many anti-viral nAbs. the IGHV1-69 is the only VH gene that has two hydrophobic residues at the tip of its CDR\u2013H2 loop that can make direct contact with the viral glycoprotein (42). the Abs 3B11 and 3B12 use the IGHV1-69*06 germ-line gene without any SHMs. human DPP4 binds to the MERS-CoV RBD with a Kd of 21.4 nM. all seven nAbs bind to the RBD with 10- to 450-fold higher affinity than to hDPP4. nAbs with higher binding affinity had higher neutralizing activity. the generation of neutralization escape mutants can be a helpful tool for identifying residues critical for neutralization and for investigating virus evolution under immune pressure. the escape mutants from these nAbs may reflect virus evolution under similar nAb-mediated immune pressure in patients. the IC50 values for 3B11-Fc and 3B12-Fc were 5.48 and 13.8 g/mL. the effects of these escape mutations on hDPP4 binding activity and viral fitness also are significant. this study identified potent anti\u2013MERS-CoV S nAbs that bind to three epitopes at the RBD interface and show minimal evidence of cross-epitope resistance. we suggest that MERS-CoV vaccines, particularly those that express S in the context of virus/VLP membranes, may be an effective way to present this vulnerable interface for immune recognition. a series of constructs encoding different fragments of MERS-CoV S protein was designed. the last-named three constructs also have Flag tags at their N termini. a full-length S with an N-terminal Flag tag was cloned into the pHAGE lentiviral vector. hDPP4 was RT-PCR-amplified from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. was then cloned into a pHAGE vector without a ZsGreen reporter gene. 293T cells, 293T-PMPLs, and S-PMPLs were

were incubated in a 96-well plate with an equal volume of pseudovirus at the final volume of 60 L at room temperature for 1 h. plaques formed in each dilution were counted 48\u201372 h. the percentage of neutralization was calculated as [(100 number of plaques with Ab)/number of plaques without Ab)] 100. the binding of MERS-VLPs to 293T-hDPP4 cells was monitored. cells were incubated with mouse
