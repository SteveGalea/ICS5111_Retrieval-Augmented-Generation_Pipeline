{"summary": "chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is considered to be one of the major diseases of modern times. bronchitis is caused by increased secretion of mucus from differentiating goblet cells leading to a thicker mucus layer lining the airways. a number of therapeutic programmes are ongoing to develop strategies for the treatment of COPD [22,23,24,24,25,26,27,28,29,30] we will focus on the current status of antiprotease therapy against COPD. the cysteine proteases including caspase-1, caspase-3, caspase-7, caspase-8, caspase-9, caspase-11, cathepsin K, and cathepsin S have also been shown to be up-regulated in COPD patients. NE is the primary enzyme present in azurophil granules in the neutrophil cytoplasm. MR899 is a cyclic thiol compound derived from homocysteine lactone and thiolactic acid. it was found to be a competitive and reversible NE inhibitor. oral administration of MR899 at a dose of 500 mg twice a day for 4 weeks was tested. oral pre-administration of ONO-6818 at a dose of 100 mg/kg was found to reduce hemoglobin concentration as well as neutrophil count and myeloperoxidase activity in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid within 6 h of human NE instillation. despite these promising results, ONO-6818 was later shown to have a deleterious effect on liver function. ase instillation, was shown to effectively reduce elastase-induced lung hemorrhage in mice. SSR69071 also decreased lung hemorrhage and lung injury. preclinical studies with AZD9668 have found it to bind NE more rapidly compared to ONO-6818 and sivelestat. Bauhinia bauhinioides L., a plant from the Caesalpinioideae sub-family, has been shown to secrete many protease inhibitors. among them, Bauhinia bauhinioides Kallikrein proteinase Inhibitor [73] and Bauhinia bauhinioides scruzipain inhibitor [74] have been found to effectively ameliorate elastase-induced e the lung Lm was reduced in the recombinant BmTI-6-D1 *(Domain 1) treated group. the BmTI-6-D1 instillation reduced the respiratory mechanics and the macrophages, neutrophil and lymphocyte count in BAL fluid. also increased the volume proportion of collagen and elastic fibers. keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC), a murine homolog of IL-8, reduced the neutrophilic load by 66% in the smoke-induced inflammation model. in-depth studies in chronic lung models are required to establish the potential of RWJ-35578 for the treatment of chronic lung inflammation associated with COPD. elastase-induced emphysema showed prominent anti-inflammatory activity compared to WT-elafin. kanamycin derived N-arylacyl O-sulfonated aminoglycoside has been shown to have the most potent IC50 (16 M) against PR3. a large number of studies have shown anti-inflammatory properties of elafin. there was no clinical evaluation of this inhibitor in COPD. clinical trials with elafin or its functional variants may be an interesting future treatment option. tryptases Tryptases are tetrameric serine proteases secreted by mast cells during anaphylactic shock. they are the most abundant form of serine proteases secreted by mast cells during anaphylactic shock. tryptases are associated with smoking-related chronic lung diseases. a number of tryptase inhibitors have been used to study the signaling mechanisms in allergic induced airway disease models [111,112,113,114] a study pertaining to COPD pathophysiology is yet to be carried out. pre-clinical studies to evaluate tryptase inhibitors in COPD models may useful to delineate further a role for this protease in COPD. chymase-positive cells were found to be higher in peripheral airway cells compared to central airways. chymase was shown to stimulate mucin production by the human bronchial epithelial cells. inhibition of chymases may be of interest in COPD treatment. trophil Elastase (NE) is the primary enzyme present in azurophil granules in the neutrophil cytoplasm. it is thought to play a role in the proteolytic breakdown of phagocytosed molecules. unopposed NE activity in the lung may lead to lung parenchyma destruction. se inhibitors tested against COPD models. FR901277 is a cyclic peptide lactone isolated from the fermentation broth of Streptomyces resistomycificus. FR901277 was shown to be effective in reducing porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE)-induced emphysema in hamsters. a saccharide derivative was found to be more potent than earlier tested NE inhibitors. AZD9668 has found it to be effective against both human NE- and cigarette smoke-induced emphysema models. AZD9668 was shown to completely prevent airspace enlargement (emphysema) and small airway remodeling in chronic models. a randomized, placebo-controlled phase IIb trial, three months treatment with AZD9668 improved neither the lung function nor the sign and symptoms associated with COPD patients. plant-derived protease inhibitors have been evaluated. rBbKI was shown to effectively reduce elastase-induced inflammation and extracellular matrix remodeling. rBbKI reduced the number of BAL cells and inflammatory markers including TNF-, lung remodeling markers (MMP-9, MMP-12, and TIMP-1), and oxidative stress markers (eNOS and iNOS) markers. cat G was found to protect against Streptococcus pneumoniae-induced lung damage. genetic knockdown of cat G has also been found to protect lung tissue destruction from long-term exposure of cigarette smoke. increased expression of cat G can lead to alveolar wall destruction. neomycin, kanamycin, and apramycin showed significant inhibition of cat G at IC50 doses ranging from 0.42 to 209 M. further in vivo studies will be required to determine the therapeutic potential of these aminoglycosides for the treatment of COPD. the engineered trappin-2, trappin-2 A62L, decreased PR3 induced pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-8 by lung cells. the GG-elafin variant was shown to reduce inflammation in both LPS challenged in vitro and acute in vivo lung inflammation models. decreased serum levels of DPP IV were found to be associated with COPD pathogenesis. increased levels of DPP IV were also associated with acute exacerbation in COPD patients. soluble recombinant human treatment (2 g/mL) reduced neutrophil infiltration. ses Tryptases are serine proteases secreted by mast cells during anaphylactic shock. they are the most abundant form of serine proteases secreted by mast cells during anaphylactic shock. tryptases have also been found to be associated with smoking-related chronic lung diseases. the primary function of chymases is the conversion of angiotensin-I to angiotensin-II. excessive leakage of chymase due to higher mast cell degranulation leads to cellular matrix degradation. chymases present in humans are -class whereas rodents possess -chymases in addition to -chymases. de Garavilla et al. provided the first evidence of the anti-inflammatory effect of chymase inhibitor JNJ-10311795 against LPS-induced airway inflammation. the inhibitor was shown to reduce inflammatory mediators within 24 h of LPS instillation. the first randomized, double-blind study was undertaken by Salmen et al. [134] who tested the efficacy of a broad spectrum MMP inhibitor, CP-471,474 in a cigarette smoke-induced emphysema model in guinea pigs. it reduced the alveolar size and destruction of lung parenchyma as compared to smoke-treated guinea pigs. a clinical, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with selective MMP-9 and MMP-12 inhibitor, AZD1236, did not yield any significant effect in reducing symptoms associated with moderate /severe COPD [138]. a lipid-lowering medication was found to effectively reduce the emphysematous changes in murine models. a single intratracheal injection of active caspase-3 into the mouse lung could induce emphysematous changes. the percentage of alveolar wall cells undergoing proliferation was higher in emphysema patients compared to healthy smokers and non-smokers. emphysematous lungs showed other signs of apoptosis. resveratrol was shown to protect bronchial epithelial cells from smoke-mediated apoptosis by attenuating the expression of caspase-3 and caspase-4. resveratrol was shown to protect bronchial epithelial cells from smoke-mediated apoptosis by attenuating the expression of caspase-3 and caspase-4. induced DNA damage, emphysema, and apoptosis in murine models. increased CD8+ cell count in bronchial biopsies has also been found to be inversely correlated with lung function in chronic bronchitis patients. only one study has demonstrated increased expression of cat K in lung homogenates. chronic smoke exposure significantly increased cat K expression by alveolar macrophages. protease: antiprotease imbalance theory is considered to be important mechanism underlying emphysema development. resveratrol was shown to protect bronchial epithelial cells from smoke-mediated apoptosis by attenuating the expression of caspase-3 and caspase-4. resveratrol was shown to protect bronchial epithelial cells from smoke-mediated apoptosis by attenuating the expression of caspase-3 and caspase-4. cathepsin S (cat S) is an elastolytic cysteine protease with both intracellular and extracellular activities including tissue remodeling. recent studies have shown an increased level of serum cat S in COPD patients which were inversely correlated with severe airway limitation. increased number of CD8+ T lymphocytes in peripheral airways was found to be associated with COPD [156,157,158] SLPI inhibited IFN- induced IB degradation and subsequently reduced cat S expression in macrophages. studies with COPD genetic models will provide more validation to use of anti-cat S therapy for COPD treatment. cathepsin E (cat E) is a major intracellular non-lysosomal aspartyl protease. it plays an important role in antigen processing, cell proliferation, and activation of cat D. emphysema pathogenesis is very limited to date. cat E is a major intracellular non-lysosomal aspartyl protease. it mediates the increased expression of mitochondrial fission protein dynamin. it activates the caspase-dependent apoptosis pathway leading to parenchymal destruction in smoke-exposed murine models. neutralisation of one such protease with a specific protease inhibitor may lessen the overall protease burden in COPD without the need for multiple inhibitors."}
