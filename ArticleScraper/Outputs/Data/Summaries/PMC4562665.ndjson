{"summary": "canine parvovirus-2 (CPV-2) causes a highly contagious and often fatal disease characterized by vomiting and hemorrhagic gastroenteritis in dogs of all ages. the vaccine could provide protective immunity against the classic CPV-2 infection in canine populations, reducing the mortality of animals and spreading of the virus. however, the long-term interaction of the virus and its host may have led to the emergence of CPV-2 antigenic variants. 201 fecal samples were collected in the form of rectal swabs from animal hospitals of the Harbin, Daqing, and Mudanjiang districts. 141 of the 201 samples, 141 were collected in Harbin, 20 were collected in Daqing, and 40 were collected in Mudanjiang. PCR amplifications were conducted in a 50 L reaction volume containing 0.1 M of forward primer, 0.1 M of reverse primer, 4 L of genomic DNA. mixtures were amplified by 35 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 55\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min. a total of 95 sequences (507 bp in length) were submitted to the NCBI Genbank under the accession numbers KT074258\u2013KT074352. a nucleotide phylogenetic tree of the VP2 fragments (507 bp) of CPV-2 was generated from the ClustalX-generated alignments.

CPV-2-positive animals aged from 2\u20134 months, 48.42% had a vaccination history, and 32.63% (31/95) had no vaccination history. all 14 CPV-2c strains and 20 new CPV-2b strains identified in our study were divided into the GI group. GII group consisted of four subgroups, GIIa, GIIb, GIIc, and GIId. recombination analysis based on the VP2 gene revealed two potential recombination events occurred between the selected 13 strains in this study and the 25 reference strains from china. Fig 2 shows the recombination event that occurred between the HRB-F8 strain (accession no. KT156836) and a G1 strain (accession no. KF482468) the recombination event was confirmed by fast neighbor-joining trees. Fig 3 shows the recombination event that occurred between MDJ-20 strain (KT156829) and a G1 strain (KF482468), which led to the recombinant 08/09 strain (GU380305). tree (1000 replicates, Kimura two-parameter distance) constructed using the regions derived from minor parent strain (1\u2013133, 558\u20131755) (B), the recombination region (134\u2013557) (C), and non-recombinant region (D). the potential recombination event was detected in Maxchi (P = 3.74E-02) and SiSscan (P = 1.42E-04) methods. mixed infections of CCoV (22.11%), CaKV (14.74%) and CBoV (7.37%) were found in the CPV-2-positive samples. a coinfection of CCoV, CBoV, and CCoV with CPV-2 was also found in one sample. the new CPV-2a (Ser297Ala) variant, accounting for 64.21% of CPV-2 infections, was the predominating strain circulating in the three districts of Heilongjiang province in northeast China. the prevalence of the new CPV-2b variant reported here in CPV-2-positive samples was higher than those in other reports in China. all 95 identified CPV-2 strains contained the unique Tyr324Ile mutation. this mutation affects binding to canine transferrin receptors. this mutation affects binding to canine transferrin receptors, resulting in stronger receptor binding. new2b and 2c strains of CPV-2 circulating in northeast china exhibited 100% amino acid identity. compared with CPV-2 reference strains, the type new2b and 2c strains showed a unique Thr440Ala substitution (100%), and the type 2c strains exhibited a unique Gln370Arg substitution (100%). the amino acid substitutions resulted in phylogenetic changes in the new2b and 2c strains identified in our study. the new CPV-2a strains are the predominating strains circulating in china. the high variability of the new CPV-2a strains in our study may be attributed to long-term interactions between the new CPV-2a strains and their hosts. the epidemiological information of CPV-2 strains circulating in china has been frequently reported. since 1983, the epidemiological information of CPV-2 strains circulating in china has been frequently reported [8, 15, 30, 34, 35, 46]. CPV-2a, CPV-2b, new CPV-2a, and new CPV-2b strains was identified in different districts of china, of which new CPV-2a was predominant strains in china. nucleotide sequences of the partial VP2 gene of CPV-2 strains identified in our study were used for analysis of recombination events. our data still need to be validated by further and extensive epidemiological investigation in future."}
