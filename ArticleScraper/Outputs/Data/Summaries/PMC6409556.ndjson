{"summary": "CoVs are classified into four genera, Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus. in 2018, these four lineages were reclassified as subgenera of Betacoronavirus and renamed as Embecovirus (previous lineage A), Sarbecovirus (previous lineage B), Merbecovirus (previous lineage C) and nobecovirus (previous lineage D) bats are a unique group of mammals of the order Chiroptera. Traditionally, bats have been classified into two suborders. the megabats, which are mostly frugivorous, and the microbats, which are mostly insectivorous. in this article, we review the various aspects of the global epidemiology of bat CoVs. the detailed molecular evolution, phylogenetic analysis and recombination studies will not be included in this review. only alphaCoVs and betaCoVs have been found in bats. several betaCoVs from the subgenus Embecovirus (Murine CoV and ChRCoV HKU24) have been discovered in rodents. scientists have proposed several possible activities or events that have led to successful interspecies jumping of CoVs in the last decade. bats serve as a major reservoir of alphaCoVs and betaCoVs. the wide diversity of bat species and their capability of sustained flight allow them to occupy a broad worldwide habitat. there are few reports on direct or indirect transmission routes between donor and recipient hosts. a high genomic mutation rate allows CoVs to evolve, and leads to high diversity with potential for host receptor adaptation. the presence of viral lipid envelopes renders CoVs sensitive to environmental conditions such as desiccation, heat, extreme pH, UV light and presence of detergents. a common phenomenon observed in both SARS-CoV and SADS-CoV outbreaks is that civets in the wild were free from the infection. civets in the wild were found to be free from the infection. alphaCoVs seem to be more widespread than betaCoVs for bats in Hong Kong. both bats have been confirmed to be the origin of SARS-CoV and SADS-CoV. the outbreaks were located in southeast china, where a large diversity of horseshoe bats resides. this suggests that the next CoV outbreak can be geographically predicted by the specific bat species\u2019 distribution. each colored rectangular box represents the geographical distribution of a specific horseshoe bat species respectively. a few horseshoe bat species like Rhinolophus ferrumequinum reside across both realms. two coV species from nobecovirus, Ro-BatCoV HKU9 and Ro-BatCoV GCCDC1 are found in a species of fruit bats located in southern Asia. most of the Rousettus and Eonycteris bats reside within the Indomalaya realm. however, these ecozones may become hotspots for interspecies jumping events of Nobecovirus. Merbecovirus diversity is positively correlated with the diversity of bats in the large family Vespertilionidae. the largest population of completely sequenced bat SARS-like CoVs were found in Chinese horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus sinicus) so far, the largest population of completely sequenced bat SARS-like CoVs were found in Chinese horseshoe bats. there are no reports on bats being symptomatic due to either alphaCoVs or betaCoVs infection. there are no reports on bats being symptomatic due to either alphaCoVs or betaCoVs infection. the genome sequences of MERS-CoV in human and dromedaries possess only around 65\u201380% nucleotide identities to those of other members of subgenus Merbecovirus from different bats. compared to Sarbecovirus and Nobecovirus, the bat hosts that harbor viruses from the Merbecovirus sub-genus are more diverse. Pteropine orthoreovirus (PRV) is a zoonotic virus from the family Rheoviridae discovered from humans and Pteropus bats. the zoonotic potential of nobecovirus should not be underestimated. surveillance of the Pteropodidae family in tropical and subtropical regions like southeast Asia is necessary for future outbreak precaution. the largest population of completely sequenced bat SARS-like CoVs were found in Chinese horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus sinicus) there are not enough data to establish the prevalence of SARS-like CoVs in different bat host species, especially the species under the genus Rhinolophus. there are no observable pathogenic features reported in bats that are infected with SARS-like CoVs. there are few reports on bats being symptomatic due to either alphaCoVs or betaCoVs infection. the majority of bat species from the Pteropodidae family are found in tropical and subtropical areas. the majority of bat species from the Pteropodidae family are found in tropical and subtropical areas. zoonotic viruses are also found in several bats belonging to the Pteropodidae family. reovirus (PRV) is a zoonotic virus from the family Rheoviridae discovered from humans and Pteropus bats. a p10 fusogenic gene was obtained from orthoreovirus [27]. surveillance of the Pteropodidae family in tropical and subtropical regions is necessary for future outbreak precaution."}
