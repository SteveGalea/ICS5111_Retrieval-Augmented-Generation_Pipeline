{"summary": "every year, this pathogen causes 30 million LRTIs and the annual death toll from RSV-related diseases is now 200,000. the virus is able to remain infectious on various environmental surfaces, suggesting fomites as a source of spread. aerosolized ribavirin (a synthetic guanosine analog) is available for treating RSV replication. ribavirin is characterized by a broad spectrum of antiviral activity, potential toxicity, besides relatively high cost. the use of ribavirin is still limited because beneficial effects on clinical outcomes remain unproved. the protein conformational rearrangement results in fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. this conformation of F is considered to be the ideal vaccine antigen. antibody and small molecules that disrupt its structure and function constitute a very active field of research. scheme 2.

MDBK, Hep-2 and BHK cells were seeded at an initial density of 6 105, 5 105, and 1 106 cells/mL, respectively, in 96-well plates containing Minimum Essential Medium with Earle's salts (MEM-E), L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 25 mg/L kanamycin. cell cultures were then incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified, 5% CO2 atmosphere virucidal Activity Assay 10d (20 M) was incubated with 1x105 PFU/mL of RSV at either 4 and 37\u00b0C for 1 h. titers were determined on vero-76 cells at high dilutions, at which the compound was not active. confluent monolayers of vero-76 cells in 96-well tissue culture plates were infected for 2 h at room temperature with 100 L of proper RSV dilutions to give a final m.o.i. of 1. after each incubation period, the monolayers were washed two times with maintenance medium and incubated with fresh medium until 10 h post-infection. 76 cells in 24-well plates were pre-chilled for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. the medium was removed and then serial dilutions of RSV in ice-cold MEM-E were added. the monolayers were washed three times in cold PBS in order to remove unbound viral particles. the presence of bound virus was detected by indirect immunofluorescence. monolayers cultures of vero-76 cells in six-well dishes were infected with RSV. after 2 h of adsorption period, the monolayer was washed with PBS. 10d was added at concentration of 50, 10 and 2 M at 8 h post infection. 72 h post infection cells were examined microscopically for syncytium formation. 293T cells were transfected with plasmid DNA encoding the eGFP-renilla luciferase dual-split fusion proteins DSP17 or DSP811 respectively. one cell population received the plasmid DNA encoding RSV L19F. another cell population was transfected with plasmid DNA coding for Mev F and H proteins for control. the binding free energy, Gbind, between 10d and the RSV F-protein was then estimated by using the MM/PBSA approach implemented in Amber 16. the corresponding Gbind was computed as: G bind = G complex - ( G protein + G ligand - E MM + G SOL - T S bind = H bind - T S bind. Viruses representative of negative-sense, single-stranded RNAs (ssRNA+) were: retroviridae: the IIIB laboratory strain of HIV-1, obtained from the supernatant of the persistently infected H9/IIIB cells (NIH 1983); bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (BVDV), Picornaviridae: human Enterovirus B [coxsackie type B5 (CV-B5), Faulkner the virus representative of double-stranded RNAs was: (vi) Reoviridae Reovirus type-1 (Reo-1) [simian virus 12, strain 3651 (ATCC VR-214)] DNA virus representatives were: (vii) Poxviridae: Vaccinia Virus (VV); (viii) Herpesviridae: Human Herpes 1 (HSV-1). cell cultures were then incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified, 5% CO2 atmosphere. the test medium used for cytotoxic and antiviral assay contained 1% of the appropriate serum. cell viability was determined after 72, 96, or 120 h at 37\u00b0C by the MTT method. titers were determined by plaque assay in vero-76 cells. dilutions in MEM-E gave compounds concentrations from 100 to 0.8 M. 50 L of RSV (approximately 200 PFU/well) and 50 L of compounds dilutions was added in triplicate. inactivated FBS, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 0.025 g/L kanamycin (Maintenance Medium) incubated with the same medium at 5% CO2 and 37\u00b0C. after each incubation period, the monolayers were washed two times with maintenance medium and incubated with fresh medium until 10 h post-infection. washed three times in PBS-Tween-100 and incubated with a 1:500 dilution of an Alexa Fluor 488-labeled anti-mouse secondary antibody. images of each well were captured with the ZOE Fluorescent Cell Imager (Biorad) approximate 200 plaque-forming units (PFU) of RSV cp-52 was added to the cells. the medium was added to non-treatment wells as non-infection controls. Syncytia developed after 3 days and were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde solution. the activity of the reconstituted luciferase was measured after cell loading with 10 M ViviRen (Promega) for 30 min. the reconstituted luciferase was measured after cell loading with 10 M ViviRen (Promega) for 30 min. the corresponding IC50 value for each compound was obtained from the fundamental relationship: Gbind = -RT log 1/IC50. the same computational protocol was applied for the simulation of an established potent RSV F-protein inhibitor in complex with the RSV F-protein for comparison purposes. the key intermediates 1-(4-aminophenyl)-5,6-dichlorobenzotriazole (1a) and 2-(4-aminophenyl)-5,6-dichlorobenzotriazole (1b) were prepared following the procedure described by Carta et al.

(2007). a Compound concentration (M) required to reduce the viability of mock-infected VERO-76 cells by 50%. the most relevant result was the potent and selective activity of ten 1-phenyl-benzotriazole derivatives. the presence of two acyl substituents on the amino group (5d) was detrimental to antiviral activity. in the case of aromatic amides the unsubstituted phenyl derivative (7a) showed only a moderate activity (EC50 = 60 M) whereas the introduction of three methoxy groups on the phenyl moiety (7d) or an electron-withdrawing group in the same position (7e-h) potentiated anti-RSV activity (EC50 = l derivatives (6d,e,f) compared to monoacyl compounds (6a,b,c) were probably due to a different arrangement in the space of the amide chains. phenyl amide or 4' substitution with an electron-donor group (8a and 8b,c respectively) generally did not exhibit high activity (EC50 = 27 - >100 M), while the derivative bearing three methoxy groups or a nitro group or a chlorine atom in 4' on the virucidal activity of 10d was further tested in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results showed a reduction of viral antigen of 80% at 20 M and an EC50 of 5M. no significant differences between the titer of RSV treated at the two different temperatures were observed. 10d failed to inhibit RSV infection at the time point analyzed. results show that pretreatment with 10d does not protect cells from RSV infection. m.o.i = 1) by addition of 10d (20 M) at different times (filled circles) data for untreated virus (open circles) and for addition of 6-azauridine (filled squares) are also shown. variation among duplicate samples was 15%. effect of 10d on formation of multinucleate Syncytia. common features of severe lower respiratory infections with RSV are cell fusion, multinucleate syncytia formation, and cell sloughing. syncytium formation was assessed 72 h p.i. in vero-76 monolayers. quantitative dose-response cell-to-cell fusion assay using the viviRen renilla luciferase substrate in the presence of compound 10d (filled symbols) the meV (Measles Virus) F and H glycoprotein expression constructs (open symbols) were included for selectivity control. cp-52 is an RSV mutant variant containing a large deletion that ablates the synthesis of the SH and G glycoproteins. cp-52 is infectious and replicates to high titer in tissue cultures. in analogy, two alternative potent compounds 10b and 8d gave comparable results. assay using the DSP-chimeric reporter proteins and the ViviRenrenilla luciferase substrate in the presence of compounds 10d (black filled symbols), 10b (green filled symbols), and 8d (red filled symbols) the meV (Measles Virus) F and H glycoprotein expression constructs (open symbols) were included for selectivity control. compound 10d is shown as atom-colored balls-and-sticks (gray, C; blue, N; red, O; green, Cl) the three F protomers are represented as colored ribbons (gray, C; blue, N; red, O; green, Cl) the same computational approach was applied to the 8d/ and 10b/protein complexes. the replacement of the cyclohexyl ring of 10d with a propyl chain in 10b did not lead to any significant variation in the interaction spectrum described for 10d. the binding energetic profile is utterlt comparable to that calculated for the 10d/protein complex with a Gbind of 7.18 0.31 kcal/mol. the hydrophobic pocket of protomer A (consisting of residues F140, M396, and F488) and the side chains of F137 and F488 of protomer B can properly accommodate the benzimidazole moiety of TMC353121 through favorable hydrophobic interactions. the morpholine group of the inhibitor optimizes protein binding by exploiting specific electrostatic interactions. the virucidal effect of 10d was negligible at the tested concentration of 20 M at either 4\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C. the virucidal effect of 10d was negligible at the tested concentration of 20 M at either 4\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C. no significant differences between the titer of RSV treated at the two different temperatures were observed. virucidal effect measured 3 days post infection in vero-76 cells pretreated with 10d. the same experiment performed with 6-azauridine (6AZA 10 M) is shown for comparison. results are presented as mean standard deviation of 3 separate experiments. 10d is active in the earliest stages of viral replication, that is the virus attachment to target cells or the virus-cell fusion event. the ability of 10d to interfere with virus binding was investigated in an immunofluorescence assay. syncytium formation was assessed 72 h p.i. in vero-76 monolayers with different concentrations of 10d at 8 h post infection. inoculum was removed 2 h post infection, cells were left untreated or incubated 8 h p.i. syncytia formation was assessed 72 h p.i. using the ZOE Fluorescent cell imager. images were taken using the ZOE Fluorescent cell imager (Bio-Rad) 10d was effective in reducing both syncytia area and number at a concentration of 50 M. this evidence suggests 10d could interfere with the RSV F protein-mediated syncytium formation. cp-52 is an RSV mutant variant containing a large deletion. compound 10d was able to specifically inhibit the RSV F protein-mediated membrane fusion process, with an EC50 value of 3.2 M (90% confidence interval = 2.9\u20133.6) repeating the same assay using the two alternative, potent compounds 8d and 10b yielded completely analogous results. the binding process was estimated to be enthalpy-driven (Hbind = 21.37 0.16 kcal/mol and -TSbind = +14.15 0.24 kcal/mol, respectively), in agreement with evidences from other RSV fusion inhibitors. the compound is shown as atom-colored balls-and-sticks (gray, C; blue, N; red, O; green, Cl) the alternative H-bond is provided by the ureidic NH group of 10d and the side chain of E487 on protomer B. the alternative H-bond is provided by the ureidic NH group of the compound and the side chain of E487 on protomer B. however, 8d is provided with a good affinity against the RSV F-protein, with a calculated IC50 of 12.5 M. 10d is less potent because it is not able to fully exploit the same plethora of stabilizing interactions that underlay binding mode of e.g., TMC353121. the hydrophobic pocket of protomer A (consisting of residues F140, M396, and F488) can properly accommodate the benzimidazole moiety of TMC353121 through favorable hydrophobic interactions. a series of new 5,6-dichloro-phenylbenzotriazole derivatives were synthesized and tested for antiviral activity against RSV. all compounds were generally endowed with high activity (EC50 in the low micromolar range), low cytotoxicity (CC50 in the high micromolar range), and very high RSV selectivity in whole-virus cell-based assays. ELISA data revealed a dose-dependent reduction of viral antigen by 10d at non-cytotoxic concentrations, whist a negligible virucidal effect of 10d was found against RSV virions. 10d effectively inhibited viral infection by hampering the binding and penetration processes of the virus into the host cells. all three protomers were found to be involved in binding 10d via stabilizing hydrogen bonds, - and other hydrophobic interactions, ultimately resulting in an IC50 value of 8.2 M. a comparison with the known and potent RSV F-protein inhibitor highlighted the molecular level the lower potency of this compound."}
