{"summary": "the introduction Newcastle disease virus (NDV) belongs to the paramyxoviridae family. it has been found worldwide since its first report among poultry in the areas of Java, Indonesia, and England in 1926. 27 of the 50 orders of birds reported to be capable of infection by NDV [1], making this disease a global animal health concern. the haemagglutination inhibition (HI) and the virus-neutralization (VN) assays are available for the detection of neutralizing antibodies against NDV [12]\u2013[16]. conventionally used VN assay is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and less objective [15], making it unsuitable for large scale evaluation of neutralizing antibodies. we further established a novel neutralization assay with the NDV-pseudotyped HIV-Luc viruses to evaluate neutralizing antibodies against NDV. the mutant HN and F were amplified from cDNA templates with the primer pairs. /HN and F/VCT were generated by replacement of the cytoplasmic domains of HN and F with the cytoplasmic domain of VSV-G (VCT) all wild-type and mutant HN and F were inserted into pCAGGS to facilitate their expression in 293 T cells. 1106 cells in 100 l PBS were stained with monoclonal antibodies against HN or F for 30 min at room temperature. pseudotyped viruses were purified by ultracentrifugation at 28000 rpm in a SW32Ti rotor (Beckman) the pellets were resuspended in PBS and aliquoted for storage at 80\u00b0C. a p24 antigen capture assay was performed as previously described. OD450 value of each well was immediately read with a microplate photometer. pseudotyped virus containing supernatant was removed and replaced with fresh DMEM supplement with 10% FBS. 48 h post-infection, 293 T cells were lysed with 50 ul lysis buffer (Promega) 293 T cells were seeded in 96-well plates with 2104 cells per well. the pseudotyped virus infection was detected by measuring the luciferase activity in the cells 48 h post infection. the luciferase activity was detected by measuring the luciferase activity in the cells. the serum-NDV mixtures were then incubated with an equal volume of NDV (100 l containing 100 TCID50) at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. the highest dilution of serum at which infectivity was inhibited in 50% of the wells was set as NT titer as previously described. the PCR products were inserted into the pCAGGS vector between the EcoR -Xho I and Hind III -Xba I sites to generate pCAGGS-HN and pCAGGS-F. mutant HN and F were generated by replacement of the cytoplasmic domains of HN and F with the cytoplasmic domain of VSV-G. production of Pseudotyped Virus Particles Production of viral particles pseudotyped with NDV envelope proteins or VSV-G were performed as previously described. the supernatant of transfected cells was replaced with fresh medium 4 h post transfection to rule out the influence of existing complexes of plasmid-transfection reagent on the following pseudovirus infection. the plate was washed four times with PBST before the addition of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG to each well and incubation at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. the reaction was stopped using 0.5 N H2SO4 after incubation at room temperature for 30 min. DF-1 cells were seeded in 96-well plates with 1105 cells per well. after 24 h, virus samples were ten-fold serially diluted with DMEM. cytopathogenic effect on cells in each well was observed using light microscopy. TCID50 values were calculated by the Reed-M\u00fcench method. negative serum control (negative serum plus pseudotyped viruses) were included. the neutralization efficiency was calculated using GraphPad Prism version 5 software. the serum dilution at 50% inhibition was calculated using NT titer. the expression of wild-type and mutant HN and F proteins was confirmed by transfection of the individual recombinant plasmids into 293 T cells. the expression of the wild-type and mutant HN and F proteins was confirmed by transfection of the individual plasmids. luciferase activity in the cells infected with NDV-pseudotyped HIV-Luc viruses reached more than 40000 RLU, much higher than in the control (P0.01) luciferase activity in the cells infected with the virus reached more than 40000 RLU, much higher than in the control. pseudotyped HIV-Luc viruses by HN and F or VSV-G envelope proteins were used to infect 293 T cells in 96-well plates. 48 h later, luciferase activity of infected cells was detected and normalized with titer of p24 protein in pseudoviruses. the highest, reaching from 8 to 50 folds higher than all other groups (P0.01) the infection efficiency between the two combinations was not significantly different (P>0.05) replacement of the cytoplasmic domain of HN by VCT greatly enhanced the infection efficiency of NDV-pseudotyped HIV-Luc viruses. however, fusion of VCT to the N-terminus of the cytoplasmic domain of HN resulted in the complete loss of infectivity. a panel of mutant and wild-type HN and F combinations were co-transfected into 293 T cells with the HIV-Luc vector. the luciferase activity of the infected cells was detected 48 h post infection and normalized with the titer of p24 in the pseudoviruses. 100 l titrated NDV-pseudotyped HIV-Luc viruses were mixed with an equal volume of diluted anti-NDV sera. the mixtures were added to 293 T cells in 96-well plates after incubating at room temperature for 1 h. neutralizing antibodies were successfully detected in all sixteen sera using the NDV-pseudotyped HIV-Luc virus versus twelve with the VN test. our results indicate that the NDV-pseudotyped HIV-Luc virus-based neutralization assay was more sensitive than the conventional VN test. antibodies (negative/total) NT positiverate (%) VN test 12/16* 4/16* 75 NDV-pseudovirus 16/16* 0/16* 100. we constructed six recombinant plasmids carrying wild-type F (F); FCT, in which the cytoplasmic domain of the F protein was deleted; F/VCT, in which the cytoplasmic domain of the F protein was replaced by VCT. individual plasmid of wild-type and mutant HN or F was transfected into 293 T cells. protein expression was evaluated with FACS after staining with anti-HN mAb or anti-F mAb. production of NDV-Pseudotyped HIV-Luc Viral Particles HIV-Luc is an HIV-1 based lentiviral vector bearing the luciferase reporter gene. luciferase activity of infected cells was detected and normalized with p24 protein in pseudoviruses. infection efficiency was 34-fold lower than with the VSV-G-pseudotyped HIV-Luc virus (P0.01) nine combinations of wild-type and mutant HN and F were co-transfected into 293 T cells with HIV-Luc vector to produce corresponding pseudotyped viruses. the infection efficiencies of VCT/HN plus F and VCT/HN plus F/VCT were the highest, reaching from 8 to 50 folds higher than all other groups. a panel of mutant and wild-type HN and F combinations were co-transfected into 293 T cells with the HIV-Luc vector. the luciferase activity of the infected cells was detected 48 h post infection and normalized with the titer of p24 in the pseudoviruses. all results are shown as means SD from four independent experiments. neutralization efficiency calculated based on the RLU of luciferase activity corresponded negatively with serum dilutions. results confirm the successful use of the NDV-pseudotyped HIV-Luc virus-based system for measuring neutralizing antibodies against NDV. NT titers from each of the sixteen immune sera against NDV were successfully detected by both neutralization assays. the NT titers determined by the NDV-pseudotyped HIV-Luc virus-based neutralization assay were two to five folds higher than those obtained with the conventional VN test. there was a strong correlation between the two neutralization assays (y = 1.05x1.81, R2 = 0.92) the correlation coefficient was 0.92. NT titer values determined by NDV-pseudotyped HIV-Luc virus plotted between 6.5 and 9 on the x-axis scale. those by VN test plotted between 5 and 8 on the y-axis scale. two other paramyxovirus pseudotyped lentiviral vectors have been successfully reported. this is the first report of a NDV-pseudotyped retroviral vector. previous reports have shown that the interaction between matrix protein and the cytoplasmic domain of envelope proteins was required for the incorporation of the envelope proteins into mature viral particles. replacement of the cytoplasmic domain of HN with VCT improved infection efficiency and stabilization of the NDV-pseudotyped HIV-Luc virus. the infectivity was lost when VCT was added directly to the N-terminus of the HN protein, regardless of which combination of F protein was used. these results differ from those seen in previous research with the Sendai virus where similar replacement and fusion were carried out. in this study, we developed a novel assay to evaluate the neutralizing antibodies using the NDV-pseudotyped HIV-Luc virus. this assay is capable of evaluating all neutralization activities of antibodies through detection of viral entrance into host cells. the NT titers determined with the NDV-pseudotyped HIV-Luc virus-based assay were around 4 times higher than those with conventional VN tests. the value titrated by this method is more variable and less objective. we prefer the latter method to titrate NDV-pseudotyped HIV-Luc viruses."}
