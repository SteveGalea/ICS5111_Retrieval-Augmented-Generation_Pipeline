{"summary": "a century later, Pasteur pioneered vaccine development by exposing people to dead or attenuated microorganisms that mimicked the infectious agent, but did not cause disease. in the 1940s the discovery that viruses could be grown in in vitro cultures on animal cells allowed the development of many vaccines against poliomyelitis, measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, hepatitis A and, more recently, rotavirus and influenza. ant DNA in the late 1970s made it possible to safely make large quantities of hepatitis B vaccine by producing it in yeast viral-like particles (VLPs) identical to those released in the plasma by the hepatitis B virus (18). more recently, reverse vaccinology used the entire genomic sequence of pathogens to discover antigens that could not be discovered by conventional approaches. structure-based antigen design recently hit another milestone. a peptide epitope from RSV has been shown to induce functional neutralizing antibodies in nonhuman primates. the same approach was used to make a completely synthetic RNA vaccine able to induce protective antibody titers in less than 40 d after the discovery of the pandemic virus (29). the potential of developing novel adjuvants has increased exponentially with the discovery of innate immune receptors. innate immune receptors such as toll-like receptors (TLRs) and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors (NLR) can synergize if combined in the same formulation. rhesus monkeys chronically infected with pathogenic simian-human immunodeficiency virus SHIV-SF162P3 (37) infusion with autologous T cells can proliferate and efficiently eliminate aggressive, treatment-refractory leukemia cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, resulting in complete tumor remission. the great challenge for the vaccine field is whether vaccines will be able to unleash the full power of the immune system and succeed in prevention and cure of these diseases in the near future. the great challenge for the vaccine field is whether vaccines will be able to unleash the full power of the immune system and succeed in prevention and cure of these diseases. the blue bars represent the time needed to develop and implement one or more vaccines derived from the same technology. the blue bars represent the time needed to develop and implement one or more vaccines derived from the same technology. a menB vaccine was recently licensed in Europe, Australia, and Canada. a maternal vaccine preventing GBS is in late-stage development. tetanus vaccination is recommended by the WHO for low-income countries with a high risk of neonatal tetanus. a vaccine against GBS is presently in late-stage development to prevent early and late onset of meningitis and decrease the risk of premature birth and stillbirth. the second population with a high need of vaccines is adolescents. udomonas, E. coli, Klebsiella, and S. aureus are within reach of modern technologies. hope is vaccines may improve health status of a population that is constantly aging. emergence of new communicable diseases will continue despite modern advances in science and technology. vaccines for the prevention of and therapy in cancer and neurodegenerative diseases today we know of two types of cancer. there are those induced by chronic infections, such as the stomach, caused by Helicobacter pylori; the liver, caused by human hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) viruses; and the cervix, caused by human papillomavirus (HPV), as well as burkitt lymphoma and nasopharyn the global convergence by 2035 requires vaccination to be available globally against most communicable diseases, especially those present only in low-income countries. but we are still struggling to develop those vaccines because there is no market to justify the investments in vaccine development. appropriate tools to calculate vaccine values have been used to calculate cost-effectiveness of vaccines. these primitive analyses restrict the calculation to cost/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) these primitive analyses do not consider the real value of vaccination. vaccines are prioritized purely on the basis of economic considerations."}
