{"summary": "mayaro virus (MAYV) is an alphavirus in the togaviridae family originally identified on the island of Trinidad in 1954. it can result in an acute febrile illness lasting 3 to 5 days with symptoms including headache, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. only sporadic cases of MAYV infection have been reported, mostly in tropical areas of south America. mayv has single-stranded, positive sense RNA genomes that encode four nonstructural proteins (nsP1-4) and structural polyproteins. envelope mRNA also encodes for a 6K polypeptide, which contributes to the processing and membrane insertion of E1 and precursor E2 (pE2) viral envelope glycoproteins. both 6K and TF appear to be involved in efficient virus budding [13, 16] DNA-based vaccines are cheaper to design, manufacture, and deploy than conventional vaccine platforms. they are capable of inducing both humoral and cellular responses with virtually no risk of causing disease themselves. improvements in plasmid and antigen designs combined with electroporation (EP)-enhanced vaccine delivery have greatly improved the immunogenicity of these vaccines. mouse splenocytes were cultured in incubators set to 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. the synthetic MAYV vaccine DNA construct encodes a full-length MAYV envelope sequence. the construct encodes a full-length MAYV envelope sequence. the transfection was carried out in Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) the transfected supernatants and cell lysates were collected 48 hours post transfection. antigen expression was confirmed by western blot analysis. cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed with lysis buffer. isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-human IgG. the nucleus was stained with 4\u2032, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) at room temperature for 20 minutes. the samples were subsequently mounted onto glass slides using a confocal microscope. each prong consists of 26-gauge, solid stainless-steel electrode, and triangulated square-wave pulses of 0.1 Amps are delivered at 52 msec/pulse twice with a 1 second delay at the insertion site. all mice were anesthetized with 2\u20135% isoflurane (Phoenix, Clipper, MO, USA) during procedures. media alone (negative control), media with cell Activation Cocktail (BioLegend, USA) containing pre-mixed phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) and ionomycin (positive control), or media with peptide pools (1 g/ml) consisting of linearly pooled 20 individual peptides that are 15-mers overlapping by 9 amino acids spanning the length of the MAYV envelope protein. 100 l of fresh 3,3\u20195,5\u2019-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) Substrate (Sigma-Aldrich) was added per well and incubated for 10 minutes. the antibody endpoint titer was defined as the highest dilution of a serum sample with OD values > (mean + 3SD) mayV envelope peptides (1g/ml) spanning the length of the entire protein. all of the samples contained a protein transport inhibitor cocktail. cells were washed again with FACS buffer, then fixed and permeabilized using BD Cytofix/Cytoperm (BD Biosciences) all data was collected using an LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR, USA) and SPICE v5. all data was collected using an LSRII flow cytometer and analyzed using FlowJo software. total weight loss reaches 20% of the body weight, (2) mice exhibited 3 or more signs of clinical symptoms concurrently for over 3 days, or (3) mice were moribund. eight days post challenge, number of surviving mice was noted and humanely euthanized. a group receiving splenocytes i.p.
