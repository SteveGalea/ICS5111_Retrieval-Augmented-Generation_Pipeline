{"summary": "study carried out to identify ethnic group differences for lower respiratory tract infections. participants 4.65 million people on whom information was available from the 2001 census followed from May 2001 to April 2010. of the lower respiratory tract infections, pneumonia causes the most deaths, with four million each year worldwide. reduction in modifiable risk factors, e.g. smoking and increased uptake of vaccination represents an important approach to reduce illness and death. a retrospective cohort study of 4.65 million individuals was created using probabilistic linkage methods. all personal identifiers including the encrypted Community Health Index identifier were removed from the data before analysis began. over 80% linkage was achieved for each ethnic group. es of interest Hospital admissions and deaths for lower respiratory tract infection, pneumonia and influenza (after hospitalisation for any of these diseases) were collected for a nine-year period from May 2001 to April 2010. the time period chosen reflects the time between the 2001 census and the most recent available outcomes data. all comparisons relate to the reference as stated or implied. no test for interaction was carried out because of the lack of statistical power. we further adjusted risk ratios for country of birth (born in the UK or born outside the UK) the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation is the Scottish Government\u2019s official measure of area-based multiple deprivation. it is based on 31 indicators in six individual domains of current income, employment, housing (although not household crowding), health, education, skills and training. bronchiolitis, respiratory tuberculosis lung abscess and pleural empyema) 480\u2013485, 486, 487, 514, 466.0, 519.8, 466.1, 513, 510, 010\u2013012 J10\u2013J18, J20\u2013J22, A15\u2013A16, J85\u2013J86 Statistical analysis. the majority of person-years at risk were for the white Scottish population. lower respiratory tract infection accounted for 201,873 hospitalisations (a rate of 528 per 100,000 person-years at risk) and influenza 2136 hospitalisations (6 per 100,000 person-years at risk). 5912 12,436,76 422.7 78.2 (70.0, 87.3) 84.5 (78.0, 91.4) 71.9 (64.5, 80.1) 79.5 (73.2, 86.3) 1594 91.4 (86.9, 96.2) White Irish 1254 159,151 633.8 117.2 (106.9, 128.5) 107.7 (99.4, 116.7) 107.2 (97.1, 118.2) 100.9 (92.5, 110.1) 353 99.3 aPoisson rates are derived from relatives risks with age adjustment using the White Scottish rate as the reference. lower respiratory tract infection white Scottish men had a rate of lower respiratory tract infection of 541 per 100,000 patient-years. women, the results (i.e. in comparison with White Scottish women) were similar to those in men, although significantly higher adjusted risk ratios (145; 95% confidence interval 120\u2013175) were found among Other South Asian women. also (as with White Irish men), risk ratios among White Irish women became significantly lower than the reference population. any mixed background 116 46,518 566.1 105.9 (87.1, 128.7) 102.0 (80.9, 128.7) 103.0 (82.0, 129.4) 100.5 (81.1, 124.5) 15 55.5 (33.5, 92.1) Indian 122 46,110 556.3 104.1 (94.4, 114.8) 112.1 (96.6, 130.1) 107.4 (94.1, 122.7) 113.9 (97.7, 132.9) 18 83.7 (52.7, 132.9) male ethnic group N of second event Overall readmission N of second event Overall readmission HR and 95% CI HR and 95% CI HR and 95% CI HR and 95% CI HR and 95% CI LRTI Pneumonia White Scottish 15409 100.0 (\u2013) 5809 100.0 (\u2013\u2013) Other White British 937 82.5 (77.1, 88.3) 368 85.5 (76.7, 95.2) Other White British 862 80.4 (74.9, 86.2) 267 Pakistani 79 159.6 (126.5, 201.3) 19 158.9 (101.2, 249.6) Other South Asian 13 85.2 (48.4, 150.1) 7 152.5 (72.6, 320.2) Other White British and Chinese had the lowest adjusted risk ratio of pneumonia hospitalisations of any group. survival was mostly similar or better in men of minority ethnic groups.

Influenza Influenza hospitalisation adjusted risk ratios were found to be higher in Pakistani men (235; 95% confidence interval 134, 412) than the reference group. we used Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation because hospitalisation/death from respiratory diseases is commonest in older populations. other alternative measures such as educational and economic status are only collected from 18 to 74 years of age. both approaches have merits and limitations. linkage was to the 2001 census, we were unable to link data to those born in Scotland after 2001. the number of children was therefore too small to allow a separate analysis. a stratified analysis by age should be a priority for future research. inactivated and live attenuated influenza vaccine is a key preventative measure for reducing the burden of pneumonia. areas where more non-White groups live have lower uptake of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine vaccination (areas with population 99\u2013100% White: 7.8% vs. areas with population 90% White: 4.2%) lower rates of pandemic H1N1 vaccination have also been found among blacks when compared to whites in the us. the strengths of Scottish Health and Ethnicity Linkage Study include the analysis at national level, the cohort design, the availability of ethnic group and sociodemographic data. we used all diagnostic data on the hospitalisation and on mortality records (so-called multi-cause coding) and not just first hospital diagnosis and underlying cause of death. linkage was to the 2001 census, we were unable to link data to those born in Scotland after 2001. lower risks could reflect unrecorded emigration. lower risks could reflect unrecorded emigration. Vaccination is a key preventative measure for reducing the burden of pneumonia. areas where more non-White groups live have lower uptake of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine vaccination. lower rates of pandemic H1N1 influenza vaccination have also been found among blacks compared to whites in the us. all authors served on the respiratory subgroup of Scottish Health and Ethnicity Linkage Study, which planned the work in detail. all authors helped to plan the study and/or analysis, interpret data, critically revise drafts of the manuscript and agreed submission of the final draft. cant advised particularly in relation to NRS contributions. the authors helped to plan the study and/or analysis, interpret data and critically revise drafts. contributetors from the Scottish Health and Ethnicity Linkage Study research team served on the Steering Group and some on other important subgroups of Scottish Health and Ethnicity Linkage Study.
