{"summary": "lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) are the most important cause of morbidity in adults. LRTIs are responsible for 7.1% of deaths worldwide each year. mortality rates of up to 44% in elderly aged >85 years have been reported. only few studies have addressed the possible etiologic influence of the URT microbiome on the development of LRTIs. the available studies typically include only small numbers of subjects without a healthy control population. research is focused on specific risk groups like HIV (human immunodeficiency virus)-infected patients. patients aged 18 years with a suspected community-acquired pneumonia were invited to participate in the study. in- and exclusion criteria were previously described. we also studied the microbiota composition of the oropharynx in 100 patients aged 60 years. samples of patients were taken before hospitalization at the emergency ward. samples of controls were taken during routine visits. samples were subsequently frozen at 70 \u00b0C until further analyses. aligned sequences were taxonomically classified using the Bayesian RDP classifier. for each sample, -diversity was determined by calculating diversity indices. qPCR was used to test for the presence of respiratory viruses and bacteria. a multivariate linear regression model was used to explore the independent association between microbiome composition and pneumonia. the correlation between relative abundance of OTUs and age was assessed using corrected Spearman rank coefficients. the optimal number of clusters was estimated using iTol. we studied the microbiota composition of the oropharynx in 100 patients aged 60 years (\u2018elderly pneumonia') and 27 patients aged 60 years (\u2018adult pneumonia') for all pneumonia patients, the pneumonia severity index was assessed and used to stratify patients in mild (PSI 1\u20133), moderate (PSI 4) and severe pneumonia (PSI 5; Fine et al., 1997). quantitative PCR was performed by amplification of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene V5\u2013V7 hypervariable region as previously described. templates containing 10 pg l1 DNA were cycled 35 times instead of 30 times. -diversity was determined by calculating diversity indices (number of observed species and Shannon) at a rarefaction depth of 1100 sequences. eluded in two aliquots of 25 l elution buffer and stored at 20 \u00b0C until further analyses. aligned sequences were taxonomically classified using the Bayesian RDP classifier. for each sample, -diversity was determined by calculating diversity indices at a rarefaction depth of 1100 sequences. nucleic acids extraction and qPCR for viruses and bacteria was used to test for the presence of respiratory viruses and bacteria. the correlation between relative abundance of OTUs and age was assessed using corrected Spearman rank coefficients. hierarchical clustering, average linkage dendrograms were built and visualized using iTol (Letunic and Bork, 2011) the optimal number of clusters was estimated using the Silhouette index. 91 (22.5%) 100 (24.7%) 187 (46.2%) 27 (6.7%) Inclusion period From December 2007 November 2008 September 2007 November 2008 to January 2008 February 2009 Age-mean (s.d.) years 75.3 (6.3)a 75.7 (8.6)a 34.4 (4.1)a 46.4 (10.0)a Male sex 49 (53.8%)b 61 (61.0%)b 19 (10.2%)b 15 (55.6%)b Smoking No. smoking 7 (7.7%)b 35 (35.0%)b 22 a total of 1 528 288 sequences were obtained over all four cohorts. a core microbiome (defined as OTUs present in >80% of individuals) of 12 out of 243 OTUs (Supplementary Table S1). two-dimensional nonmetric multidimensional scaling plot of the oropharyngeal microbiome composition in adult and elderly pneumonia patients. each dot represents the total oropharyngeal microbiome composition of a single individual and was colored according to group; healthy elderly in blue, elderly pneumonia patients in yellow, healthy adults in green and adult pneumonia patients in red. we observed a positive CT-value (40 cycles) for lytA in 56% of elderly pneumonia patients respectively, vs 17% in healthy elderly (2-test, P0.0005) the observed age-related dynamics of the above species could be verified within the healthy elderly cohort. bars represent geomean and 95% CI of geomean per group. species richness decreased in elderly pneumonia patients compared with healthy elderly. differences were not detected in the young adult cohort. bars represent geomean and 95% CI of geomean per group. healthy adults vs adult pneumonia (triangles) and healthy adults vs healthy elderly were calculated using Mann\u2013Whitney U-tests. two clusters (IIIb, n=76 and IIIa, n=7) showed a relative abundance of Prevotella melaninogenica (4% vs 1%) within these two clusters, 80/83 (96%) subjects were healthy individuals. 98/100 (98%) of the individuals in this cluster were healthy. three clusters were significantly associated with health. clusters showed high relative abundance of either lactobacilli (IV), Rothia (Va) or Streptococcus (pseudo)pneumoniae (VII) cluster IV was most strongly associated with the presence of influenza virus (50%). oropharyngeal samples were taken from elderly and adult controls and pneumonia patients. 88 (96.7%) 100 (100.0%) influenza virus (A/B) 0 (0.0%)a 19 (19.0%)a NA 2 (7.4%) RSV 2 (2.2%) 5 (5.0%)b NA 0 (0.0%) Rhinovirus 0 (0.0%) 4 (4.0%) NA 1 (3.7%) Other virusesd 1 (1.1%) 5 (5.0%) NA 1 (3.7%) seven OTUs, prevotella melaninogenica, leptotrichia, Streptococcus OTU rank 5, leptotrichia, Streptococcus OTU rank 8, Veillonella dispar, Parascardovia, Gemellales and Prevotella OTU rank 20, appeared most discriminative. the decision tree was validated separately for the young adult and within-young adult cohort analysis. decision tree model based on the relative abundance of prevotella melaninogenica, Leptotrichia, Streptococcus, Gemellales and Parascardovia. seven variables (Prevotella melaninogenica, Leptotrichia, Streptococcus, Gemellales and Parascardovia) were found to be most important in the discrimination between healthy controls and pneumonia patients. cohorta Specificity (95% CI) 90% (82\u201395%) 97% (94\u201399%) Sensitivity (95% CI) 89% (81\u201394%) 67% (46\u201383%) Combinedb Specificity (95% CI) 95% (92\u201397%) Sensitivity (95% CI) 84% (76\u201390%) Fivefold cross-validation combinedc Specificity (95% CI) 89% (88\u201391%) Sensitivity (95% CI) 73% (70 Statistically significant differences in variables between healthy elderly and elderly pneumonia patients as well as between healthy adults and adult pneumonia patients were calculated using a Student's t-test or a Student's t-test. a total of 1 528 288 sequences were obtained over all four cohorts. a core microbiome (defined as OTUs present in >80% of individuals) of 12 out of 243 OTUs (Supplementary Table S1). differences were observed using Jensen\u2013Shannon and weighted Unifrac as distance measures. each dot represents the total oropharyngeal microbiome composition of a single individual and was colored according to group; healthy elderly in blue, elderly pneumonia patients in yellow, healthy adults in green and adult pneumonia patients in red. the data set lacked the statistical power to assess the associations between disease severity and microbiome composition. we verified the contribution of Streptococcus pneumoniae in our study cohorts by qPCR. diversity and bacterial density in relation to health and pneumonia was decreased in elderly pneumonia patients compared with healthy elderly. bacterial density was significantly higher in elderly pneumonia patients as opposed to elderly controls. the bacterial density per sample is depicted in pg l1. bars represent geomean and 95% CI of geomean per group. differences between groups were calculated using Mann\u2013Whitney U-tests. 4/42 (81%) of the individuals in this cluster were pneumonia patients. a third large cluster (VIII, n=100) showed a more even profile. 98/100 (98%) of the individuals in this cluster were healthy. presence of influenza virus and non-influenza virus is shown in purple and orange respectively. dark purple/orange, virus present in moderate-high amount (CT-value 35 cycles); moderate light purple/orange, virus present in low amount (CT-value 35\u201345 cycles); white, no viral qPCR performed. clusters of samples comprising less than four samples are shown opaque. viral presence was more frequently observed in the pneumonia-associated clusters. the Lactobacillus-dominated cluster IV (5/10 positive for any virus (50%), one missing, and the Streptococcus (pseudo)pneumoniae-dominated cluster VII (6/31 positive (19%), 11 missing. seven OTUs, prevotella melaninogenica, leptotrichia, Streptococcus OTU rank 5, leptotrichia, Streptococcus OTU rank 8, Veillonella dispar, Parascardovia, Gemellales and Prevotella OTU rank 20, appeared most discriminative. the decision tree model was based on the total study cohort and the final model was based on five OTUs. a high specificity was retained for both the within-elderly cohort and within-young adult cohort analysis. the results decision tree model was based on the relative abundance of prevotella melaninogenica, Leptotrichia, Streptococcus, Gemellales, Parascardovia, Prevotella OTU rank 20 and Veillonella dispar. 82 (90.1%) 89 (89.0%) 182 (97.3%) 18 (66.7%) Incorrectly classified (n, (%)) 9 (9.9%) 11 (11.0%) 5 (2.7%) 9 (33.3%) Elderly cohorta Specificity (95% CI) 90% (82\u201395%) 97% (94\u201399%) Sensitivity (95% CI) 89% (81\u201394%) 67% (46\u201383%) Combinedb Specificity (95% CI) 95% (92\u201397%) Sen discussion The URT can be regarded as an ecological niche in which a dynamic interplay takes place between commensals and potential disease causing bacteria. the microbiome is generally advantageous to the host by direct or immune-mediated colonization resistance, which refers to the resilience against invasion and dissemination of pathogens. prevotella is associated with a reduced risk of hospital-acquired pneumonia in adult ICU-patients. leptotrichia is a lactic acid-producing bacterium of the Fusobacteriaceae. this is in line with observations regarding periodontal health. new longitudinal studies should be executed to elucidate a possible role of the observed species in relation to increased or decreased risk of developing respiratory infections. potential limitations include the relatively high number of \u2018healthy' non-pneumonia elderly suffering from one or more comorbidities, although this seems to reflect the normal population distribution of comorbidities. in our young adult cohort largely resembled those observed in the Human Metagenome Project. sampling was performed by multiple different caregivers in different hospitals and home-based settings. this is the first explorative study on correlations between oropharyngeal microbiota composition and health and pneumonia in large cohorts of elderly and young adult individuals.
