{"summary": "a growing diversity of biological data is tagged with unique identifiers (UIDs) associated with polynucleotides and proteins to ensure efficient computer-mediated data storage, maintenance, and processing. these identifiers are often substituted by biologically meaningful names in various presentations to facilitate utilization and dissemination of sequence-based knowledge. SNAD mediates automatic conversion of sequence UIDs into biologically meaningful names and acronyms. unique and non-unique identifiers in databases used by SNAD database Identifier Uniqueness Example GenBank1 gi number, primary ID + 1234567 version number = accession.version +9 AY123456.1 accession number - AY123456, NC_006558, NP_000483 locus/sequence name - MTVCG, SCU49845 UniProt2 accession number + Q10AA9, P47123, A2 some replaced or removed records in GenBank have no accession number but they can be retrieved from GenBank with the primary ID. sequence IDs are commonly replaced by biologically meaningful names and acronyms, e.g. species names in trees and gene/protein names in alignments. researchers studying few economically most important viruses developed nomenclatures restricted for these viruses [17-22] each decision about naming that concerns a majority of viruses is an ad hoc and, often, lengthy process. naming viruses with artificially designed genomes, which are not product of natural evolution, is formally outside of the ICTV authority and completely unregulated. SNAD recognizes input as alignment or tree with the use of BioPerl drivers. if the input is not recognized as alignment or tree, SNAD processes it as a list of identifiers separated by one or more of the following symbols. SNAD uses standard bioPerl functions from Bio::Seq for extracting features/annotation from the database entries. SNAD analyzes input, extracts UIDs from it and queries a user-defined database to locate cognate entries. the next step is extracting annotation from the entries and parsing the user-selected template. SNAD substitutes the submitted UIDs in list, alignment, or tree with the designed names. SNAD accepts IDs from five databases (Table 1) including GenBank (gi or accession number) and UniProt (accession number or entry name) that are automatically recognized in and extracted from the input data prepared in several formats. examples of IDs, unique and non-unique, in alignment, tree, and plain list are available for testing purposes. UIDs from source DB can be used for searching in target DBs. only gi's from GenBank are recognized as UID in SeqHound. SNAD generates a tree drawn to facilitate visual inspection of generated names in graphic format. two other templates can be used for converting UIDs into gene and species names. the \"Complex species name\" template combines full species name with primary ID. the \"Complex protein name\" includes primary ID, condensed species name, protein description and CDS. SNAD-mediated solution to the generation of complex virus names reinforces the role of diverse fields in sequence entries as the primary source of information. if these fields are completed with records as expected, viruses can be readily generated under different and evolving conventions. SNAD provides a tool for exploration of different name arrangements that could facilitate the development of conventions for naming different viruses by the virology community. SNAD has a menu that controls output display interactively. output includes ID-to-name log in which selected information about generated names is detailed in table format. users can also extract IDs from submitted alignment or tree. a tool for controllable annotation-based conversion of sequence UIDs into biologically meaningful names and acronyms has been developed and placed into service. authors read and approved the final version of the manuscript."}
