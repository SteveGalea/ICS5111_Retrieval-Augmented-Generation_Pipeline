{"summary": "critical care providers receive little to no training on how to perform safe and effective ICU evacuations during a disaster. the suggestions are important for all who are involved in pandemics or disasters with multiple critically ill or injured patients. mutual-aid agreements should be established with other appropriately staffed and resourced hospitals to redistribute critically ill and injured patients from an evacuating hospital. we suggest creation of predisaster formal agreements between hospitals and transport agencies or between health coalitions or regional health authorities and transport agencies for air or ground transport of critically ill patients during a disaster. a primary role of the CCTL should be to categorize each candidate ICU patient evacuee by (1) ICU resources required and (2) skill set of transport staff required. 4d. we suggest CCTLs and staff should receive special training, education, and practice on patient categorization and transport requirements. flexible electrical power and oxygen requirements should be available to support patients with respiratory failure that can maintain function while either sheltering in place or evacuating to an outside facility. surge ventilators may be of limited capability but should be able to ventilate and oxygenate patients with acute lung injury or ARDS as well as airflow obstruction. they should be safe (disconnect alarm) and relatively easy for staff to operate. the most critically ill patients dependent on mechanical devices for life support may be safely cared for with a shelter-in-place strategy if it is deemed the risk of evacuation is too high. 9b.i. every hospital should be specifically affiliated with (and drill evacuation with a Regional or National Command Center for such events) a staging area should be ideally located near the point of embarkation and be staffed by medical personnel with training and experience in critical care evacuation. we suggest a paper medical record be required to travel with the patient because there may be no ability to send an electronic copy of the medical record or the receiving facility may not be able to read the electronic format. we suggest alteration in the usual standards for modes of transport may be required during a disaster where transport resources are overwhelmed. tracking of patients should commence in the sending clinical unit, continue to the point of embarkation, and if possible, continue to the destination facility. we suggest both the evacuating and receiving hospitals should track patients and equipment. 2c. we suggest hospital exercises should simulate a mass critical care event. we suggest specialized care is resource intensive, and specialized ground and aeromedical teams may be required to ensure appropriate initial and ongoing care prior to and during evacuation. designate a Critical Care Team Leader 4a. We suggest the CCTL should support early and frequent communication between Incident Command and a designated Critical Care Team Leader during an impending evacuation. initiate pre-event ICU Evacuation Plan 5a. if pre-event hospital evacuation of critically ill patients might be required, then we suggest planning for patient evacuation or shelter in place using an Incident Command System should begin as early as possible. possible strategies include shelter in place, partial evacuation, or early evacuation. 7b. we suggest availability of adequate portable energy and medical gas flexible ventilators. the most critically ill patients dependent on mechanical devices for life support may be safely cared for with a shelter-in-place strategy. CCTLs should coordinate with Hospital Incident Command and identify receiving hospitals for patient evacuation. 9b.i. every hospital should be specifically affiliated with (and drill evacuation with a Regional or National Command Center for such events) a regional or national emergency command center may need to assume responsibility for designation of the receiving facilities for their patients. the CCTL and staff recommend utilizing a staging area for patients prepared and awaiting transport. the area should have the capability for additional surgical and medical stabilization pretransport if necessary. we suggest a paper medical record be required to travel with the patient because there may be no ability to send an electronic copy of the medical record. minimum data sets for tracking should include the patient first and last name, date of birth, medical record number or tracking number or triage number, time leaving facility, time leaving facility, transportation company name and transport vehicle number. 13c. we suggest both the evacuating and receiving hospitals should track patients and equipment. ICU evacuation was not included as a central topic in the prior American College of Chest Physicians consensus statement. this consensus development process and literature search was created de novo.

to 2012. 139 of 519 articles were selected for critical review. no studies of sufficient quality were identified. few hospitals and regional health-care coalitions have created mutual-aid agreements for this purpose. financial compensation for patient transfer and proper credentialing of outside providers have been cited as significant challenges. prepare for and Simulate Critical Care Evacuation 2a. disaster plans that consider staffing requirements for safe and rapid vertical evacuation are important. prepare for and Simulate Critical Care Transport 3a. we suggest specialized care is resource intensive. we suggest preidentifying unique transport resources that are required for movement of specific populations. common problem areas deserving additional focus include contingency plans when ICUs suffer significant infrastructure damage,3,19,20 timing of evacuation,2 evacuation methods (including vertical evacuation plans),21,24-26 patient distribution, and tracking. the 9/11 disaster highlighted the paucity of pediatric medical resources compared with available adult services. a critical care unit leader is an essential direct point of contact for the Hospital Incident Command Center during evacuation of critically ill patients. the CCTL should receive education and training similar to other HICS leaders. the CCTL should receive education and training similar to other HICS leaders. each ICU would categorize its patients more frequently, even hourly. this would occur at least daily during routine care. this would be entered into an electronic checklist. structure should be activated and evaluate existing hospital resources, including food, water, backup generators, staff, and equipment. the CCTL should start evacuation planning well in advance of the official decision to evacuate, starting by requesting that each ICU team complete the Critical Care Patient Categorization Checklist. the CCTL should be aware of the process for requesting evacuation assistance and the resources available at a regional and national level. in the united states, the federal government mobilizes emergency medical resources through the national disaster medical system (NDMS) the first NDMS response requiring large-scale regional patient evacuation followed Hurricane Katrina in 2005. surge ventilators with flexible electrical power and oxygen requirements should be available to support patients with respiratory failure. they should be portable, run on alternating current power with battery backup. they should be able to ventilate and oxygenate patients with acute lung injury or ARDS as well as airflow obstruction. prioritizing Critical Care Patients for Evacuation 8 suggests evacuation order and identification of appropriate facility should be based on factors: 8a. in a time-limited evacuation, less critical patients can be evacuated faster and with fewer resources per patient. if there is adequate time for evacuation, more critically ill patients may be moved first and in parallel with less ill patients. factors to consider are infrastructure damage, medical supplies and staff resources, anticipated additional patients and their needs, and provider capability. if the disaster-affected hospital is able to deliver care, it should provide medical supplies and assistance to rapidly stabilize and prepare patients for evacuation. regional or national agencies are responsible for selecting appropriate receiving hospitals for evacuations. the responsible agencies vary from country to country. in the united kingdom, emergency evacuation and patient allocation during a disaster is the responsibility of the national health service. a risk of medical equipment malfunction exists during transport due to factors such as temperature and barometric pressure swings, vibration, limited supply of electric power and oxygen, and electromagnetic interference. a solution adopted by experienced military transport programs is to equip the transport team with a standard gear set. we suggest utilizing a staging area for patients prepared and awaiting transport. the most critical patients should be staged directly from their bed in the sending hospital. this can be accomplished by adding a transport staging team to the hospital. this can be accomplished by adding a staging area adjacent to an airfield. electronic media provide the most efficient means of transferring a large volume of data. effective electronic transfer may be limited by incompatibility issues between sending and receiving hospitals or because of computer system malfunction. we suggest transportation methods should prioritize moving the greatest number of patients as quickly and safely as possible. tracking of patients should commence in the sending clinical unit; continue to the point of embarkation; and, if possible, continue to the destination facility. minimum data sets should include the patient first and last name, date of birth, medical record number or tracking number or triage number, time leaving facility, and expected destination and next of kin. a large-scale exercise provides an opportunity to identify weaknesses and to train personnel to optimally use the system. multiple models have been published describing successful evaluation of a tracking system. 77-81 Form Hospital and Transport Agreements 1a. hospitals and coalitions should consider defining the process of provider credentialing, repatriation, and payment for services rendered once a crisis resolves. prepared for and Simulate Critical Care Evacuation 2a. we suggest hospital exercises should simulate a mass critical care event. multiple reports have described the hazards of planning and conducting large-scale critical care movement at the time of a disaster. such efforts have been marked by significant heroism but lack of resource coordination resulting in frequent reduction in patient monitoring and supportive care. centralized regional real-time tracking and communication are essential to match available facilities\u2019 resources to patients. close coordination with specialty centers can minimize adverse outcomes during transport. we suggest the CCTL coordinating the critical care evacuation should support early and frequent communication. a critical care unit leader is an essential direct point of contact for the Hospital Incident Command Center during evacuation of critically ill patients. the CCTL should receive education and training similar to other HICS leaders. the CCTL should receive education and training similar to other HICS leaders. every ICU would categorize its patients more frequently, even hourly. each unit leader most aware of patient details should be relayed directly to and verified by the Critical Care Team Leader. a mechanism for electronically collating these data so that both the Critical Care Team Leader and the Incident Command can have real-time ICU situational awareness. we suggest a checklist approach to evacuation when an ICU evacuation appears imminent. we suggest a clear and direct mechanism for communication with local governing bodies to prevent obstruction of ground medical transport during a threatened hospital evacuation. in the united states, the federal government mobilizes emergency medical resources through the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) the hospital must request assistance through local emergency management. since its inception in 1984, the first NDMS response requiring large-scale regional patient evacuation followed Hurricane Katrina in 2005. oxygenate patients with acute lung injury or ARDS as well as airflow obstruction. this requires capability to deliver a high minute ventilation, high flow, and high positive end-expiratory pressure. this requires capability to deliver a high minute ventilation, high flow, and high positive end-expiratory pressure. the most critically ill patients dependent on mechanical devices for life support may be safely cared for with a shelter-in-place strategy if it is deemed the risk of evacuation is too high. in some situations, it may be favorable to evacuate less ill patients first and in other situations, it may be favorable to evacuate the most critically ill patients first. if the disaster-affected hospital is able to deliver care, it should provide medical supplies and assistance to rapidly stabilize and prepare patients for evacuation. burn surgeons and staff have been deployed to the incident hospital to ensure adequate patient resuscitation and management prior to evacuation for definitive burn care. patients who require advanced specialty care should be directed to high-volume centers and distribution take into account the capacity and resources required to provide ongoing care to these patients. standardized preparation of critically ill patients should be performed prior to hospital-to-hospital transfer. a solution adopted by experienced military transport programs is to equip the transport team with a standard gear set. the transport team\u2019s equipment is applied to patients in the sending hospital, and patients are observed for stability prior to departure. a solution to relieve caregivers in a disaster area is to insert teams that can manage these patients until they are ready for transport. a transport staging team is needed to create a staging area adjacent to an airfield. this may be required if there is a long distance from hospital to airfield. the staging area is collecting patients from multiple hospitals for evacuation on the same vehicle. the most rapid means of decompression is to transfer patients to the nearest hospital with adequate resources. we suggest alteration in the usual standards for modes of transport may be required during a disaster where transport resources are overwhelmed and evacuation and transport of critically ill patients to a receiving hospital ICU is required. we suggest both the evacuating and receiving hospitals should track patients and equipment. an efficient mechanism is necessary to track patients from the point of initial triage back through the evacuation chain to the final receiving hospital. the availability of patient care equipment must also be closely tracked. regional resources, along with the variation and complexity associated with the care and transport of critically ill patients following a variety of disaster events, make it impossible to provide systematic, evidence-based recommendations to guide universal preparations in this area. all critical care providers should become familiar with the newly proposed ICU Evacuation Timeline and its three stages: (1) no immediate threat, (2) ICU evacuation threat, and (3) ICU evacuation."}
