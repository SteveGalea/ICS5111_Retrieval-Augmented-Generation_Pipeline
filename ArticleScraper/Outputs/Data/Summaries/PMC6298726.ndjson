{"summary": "most of these diseases are of viral origin, suggesting the emergence and reemergence of viruses that are triggered by human activities that modify the environment. the populations of wild animals that inhabit forest fragments are strategic groups for studies of public health and the transmission of zoonosis. acute gastroenteritis can be caused by infection in the gastrointestinal tract, caused by different infectious or parasite agents. the occurrence, diversity and role of rotavirus in these animals are still poorly studied. in the Brazilian Amazon, especially in the state of Par\u00e1, the city of Bel\u00e9m and northeast metropolitan mesoregions are some of the areas with the highest indexes of environmental changes [35], which are concentrated. the study area included the settlements of Expedito Ribeiro (Santa B\u00e1rbara do Par\u00e1), Vila Ananin (Peixe-Boi) and A\u00e7aiteua-Centro Alegre (Viseu), located in areas with environmental degradation in the state of Par\u00e1. data on deforestation and land use were obtained from the PRODES [43] and TerraClass [44] Projects. the satellite image was generated using the sensor Sentinel 2 of the European Space Agency (ESA) from the years of 2017 and 2018. All the data obtained was stored in a Geographic Database (BDG) the chi-square analysis was carried out using the EstimateS 8.0 software. indices of infected animals were calculated for each treatment sampled by collection area. the data was inserted into a database for a descriptive analysis. wild animals (small non-flying mammals) were trapped in live-containment traps of the Tomahawk cage (size 45x16x16cm) and Sherman type aluminum (size 30x9x8cm) in each sample plot, 61 traps were distributed, 20 Shermans and 41 Tomahawks being baited with a mixture made with peanut paste, sardines, cod liver oil and corn meal, as well as fruit like banana, apple and pineapple. primers for the NSP3 gene, Primer NSP3 Forward (20mM), Primer NSP3 Reverse (20mM), template (RNA) 3L, having a total reaction volume of 17L and reverse transcription cycling of 50\u00b0C, 30 minutes, denaturation of 95\u00b0C, 10 minutes, annealing of 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C, 15 seconds. the city of Santa B\u00e1rbara do Par\u00e1 presents a tropical type of motion-type Am and Viseu presents atype of motion, with dry seasons in summer and winter-Am, As and Aw. the collection points of the positive samples were georeferenced and the data were transported to the ArcGIS 10.3 program. all the data obtained was stored in a Geographic Database (BDG) the BDG was imported/stored in a GIS for the editing of graphic elements, establishment of topological relations between the elements and their respective attributes. the selected fragments were distributed within the mesoregions studied. the data obtained for the occurrence of RVA was inserted into a database for a descriptive analysis of the epidemiological profile of the animal population in the three forest ecosystems studied. descriptive statistical treatments were carried out using customized \"row-columns\" type charts, referring to the data, to characterize the sample. the wild animals were sedated with a combination of ketamine 20mg/kg and xylazine 2mg/kg intramuscularly and then euthanized with anesthetic overdose of 2% lidocaine. from October 2014 to April 2016, 1,282 fecal samples were collected from wild and domestic animals. all RVA-positive samples were subjected to reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. first round was performed with consensus primers N-VP4F1/N-VP4R1 and the Nested-PCR was conducted with the same primers of Nested-PCR. sequence fragments were assembled and edited using the geneious biosystems software platform v.8.1.7. 61 traps were distributed in each sample plot, 20 Shermans and 41 Tomahawks were baited with a mixture made with peanut paste, sardines, cod liver oil and corn meal. the wild animals were sedated with ketamine 20mg/kg and xylazine 2mg/kg intramuscularly and euthanized with anesthetic overdose of 2% lidocaine in the foramen magnum. the assay was conducted in a mixture containing: RNAse-free H2O, TAqMan RT Enzyme Mix (40x), primers for the NSP3 gene, Primer NSP3 Forward (20mM), Primer NSP3 Reverse (20mM), template (RNA) 3L. the analysis was considered positive when presenting the cycle threshold (CT) 40. fecal samples of wild and domestic animals belonging to three forest fragments areas were tested by qualitative qPCR. 178 (27.5%) were positive for RVA, distributed among the species: birds (23.6%), canines (21.35%), bats (17.98%), cattle (14.6%), horses (8.43%), small rodents (6.74%), swine (3.93%) and felines (38.36) Fig 3 shows the results obtained for all the species of animals investigated in the forest fragment as well as in the peridomicillus area. the anthropic variables were analyzed for the three cities studied, as well as the use of the soil within the range of the animals. the city of Peixe Boi had the largest area, according to the data shown in Fig 5. in the city of Viseu, a higher regeneration was observed in the pastures during the period of the study. annual rainfall is quite high, generally around 2,350 mm, but strongly concentrated from January to June (80%). the average deforestation index in the three study areas was calculated from data obtained from INPE information systems. it was observed that in the years of 2013 to 2014 there were no changes in these regions; in the period from 2014 to 2015 about 4.1% of the city of Viseu was changed. in relation to the period of 2016, great changes were observed in Peixe Boi (79%) and in the city of Viseu (70%) 80 stool samples were selected, reextracted and analyzed using PCR for the VP4 gene. eight strains (10%) were positive for VP4 gene, being 2 strains bellowed to P[6] genotype and 6 to P[4]-type. the first description of RVA in chiroptera was recorded in feces of Eidolon helvum caught in Vihiga, Kenya. the present study shows the occurrence of RVA in 17.98% of the chiroptera. a prevalence of 28.12% was of Desmodus rotundus. in the amazon region there are records of RVA, RVD, RVF and RVG that infect birds [57\u201358] and RVG in migratory birds [59]. prevalence in felines (16%) and pigs (22%) was lower, probably because there are few animals of these species in the region, as well as few creations. the wild animals detected in the present study are asymptomatic and have low viral load for RVA. the occurrence of RVA in this population of animals may explain the possibility of dispersion of viral strains. the occurrence of RVA in this population of animals may explain the possibility of dispersion of viral strains. the RT-qPCR assay may be a useful alternative for the differential diagnosis of RV in possible coexisting mixed infections clinically indistinguishable. the most prevalent genotypes isolated from feces of Belgian diarrheal and non-diarrheal piglets in 2012 [62] demonstrate a wide range of combinations of genotypes G / P including. the most prevalent genotypes isolated from feces of Belgian diarrheal and non-diarrhe this genotype was described in animal and human populations in studies of Luchs et al. [32]; Honma et al. [67]; Arajo et al.[68]; Mascarenhas et al.[69] and Lorenzetti et al. [70] such studies corroborate the importance of continuing to monitor genotypes to verify if uncommon strains or new strains are emerging. the quality of the analyzed samples is characterized as low detectable viral load. the technique presented a good analytical response in the detection of the source animals."}
