{"summary": "Purpose Human adenovirus infection mimics Kawasaki disease (KD) but can be detected in patients with isolated adenoviral infection. 147 patients with isolated adenovirus were identified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. 11 patients with isolated adenovirus were also evaluated. adenoviral infection is often involved in young children less than 3 years. it is characterized with prolonged high fever, upper and lower respiratory tract symptom, conjunctivitis and gastrointestinal symptom with hepatic involvement. 129 patients with adenoviral infection were diagnosed during this period. the most common symptoms were fever more than 4 days (81.3%), cough (73.2%), sputum (68.8%), rhinorrhea (65.2%). adenoviral fever was initially diagnosed in 12 patients (8.2%). laboratory & clinical characteristics analysis All patients with KD were examined for inflammatory markers such as total white blood cell count, neutrophil count, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, ESR, CRP, lactate dehydrogenase (LD) and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) to identify the coronary abnormalities, we assessed the z value of coronary arteries according to the body surface area. continuous variables were expressed as the median (interquartile range) and categorical variables as either a number or a percentage. the most common symptoms were fever more than 4 days (81.3%), cough (73.2%), sputum (68.8%), rhinorrhea (65.2%). the most common diagnosis at admission was acute pharyngotonsillitis (57.3%), followed by pneumonia (16.1%), bronchiolitis (12.5%), and gastroenteritis (5.9%). acute clinical features such as conjunctival injection, lip and tongue changes, skin rash, cervical lymphadenopathy, and changes in extremities were also evaluated. all patients with KD were initially treated with IVIG (2 g/kg) for 12 hours and additionally treated with IVIG in case of IVIG resistance. a multivariate analysis was performed to detect independent variables associated with KD with adenoviral detection using all parameters with a P value0.05. the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve was used to evaluate the discrimination of KD with adenoviral detection from isolated adenoviral infection. AST/ALT elevation more than 45 IU/L was detected in 3 patients. sterile pyuria defined as 10 WBC/high-power field was shown in 6 patients. four patients had developed coronary artery abnormalities. the median fever duration was 6 days and was not different from isolated adenoviral infection group (P=0.356) lip and tongue changes and skin rash were more frequently demonstrated in the KD with adenoviral detection group than the adenoviral infection group. 0.351 Total fever duration (day) 6 (5.0\u20136.5) 6 (4.9\u20136.6) 0.356 Conjunctival injection 11 (100) 110 (74.8) 0.067 Lip and tongue change 9 (81.8) 23 (15.6) 0.001* Cervical lymphadenitis 9 (81.8) 78 (53.1) 0.084 Changes in extremities 7 (63.6) 15 (10.2) 0.001* Total white blood cell count (103/L) 10.5 (8.4\u201319.5) 1 the cutoff value of CRP that differentiated adenovirus-positive KD from isolated adenoviral infection was 56 mg/L. the cutoff value of CRP that differentiated adenovirus-positive KD from isolated adenoviral infection was 56 mg/L, which resulted in a sensitivity of 81.8% and a specificity of 75.9%. clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients with KD with adenovirus were compared with those who were adenovirus-negative (n=87) we excluded the patients with other virus isolation (n=31) in the adenovirus-negative group. adenovirus without coinfection was identified in 11 patients. the median age of these patients was 36 months (range, 5\u2013109 months) nine patients (81.8%) were diagnosed as typical KD. most of the patients had 4 or more clinical symptoms satisfying the KD criteria. coroner artery abnormalities 2 (43.1) Values are presented as median (range), number, or number (%).
