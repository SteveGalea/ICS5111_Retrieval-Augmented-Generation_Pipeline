{"summary": "human metapneumovirus (HMPV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza A virus (IAV) are leading causes of acute lower respiratory infection (LRI) worldwide. no effective vaccines or therapeutics exist for either HMPV or RSV. protective immunity is poorly established as individuals can be repeatedly reinfected throughout life (5\u20137) anti\u2013PD-1 monoclonal antibody therapy is safe and at least partially effective against both refractory hematological malignancies (30) and solid tumors. a role for PD-1 in mediating TCD8 impairment during acute infections is unclear. mice acutely infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus have functional TCD8 that rapidly downregulate PD-1 in the infected spleen. memory TCD8 were severely impaired and expressed more PD-1 than TCD8 during secondary infection. PD-1 signaling blockade during challenge infection restored function to pulmonary TCD8. PD-1 and PD-L1 were expressed in the lungs of patients with severe acute viral LRI. RT-PCR targeting the HMPV N gene was used to quantify genome levels in the lungs of infected mice at the indicated times after infection. images represent serially cut lung sections stained with H&E or anti-CD3. data in B are representative of 3 experiments. in spleen, 11.8% of lung-infiltrating TCD8 were detected with M195 tetramer, while only 3.5% produced IFN- or degranulated when restimulated with M195 peptide. a large fraction of pulmonary H. MPV-specific TCD8 failed to respond to antigen, and this impairment persisted for several weeks beyond viral clearance. spleen and lung lymphocytes were isolated from B7tg mice at the indicated times after HMPV infection. thirty-six percent of lung-infiltrating TCD8 expressed granzyme B (GzmB) while about two-thirds of M195-specific TCD8 were predominantly M195 tetramer+. pulmonary HMPV-specific TCD8 were impaired in multiple key effector functions. over half of pulmonary TCD8 remained PD-1+ several weeks after viral clearance. PD-1 levels returned to those observed during primary infection. PD-1 expression was not restricted to a limited TCR repertoire. PD-1 expression was not restricted to a limited TCR repertoire. the immunodominant epitopes A34R82\u201390 (A34R) and D1R808\u2013817 (data not shown) indicate that functional impairment of pulmonary PD-1hi TCD8 is a common host response to different virus families capable of causing acute LRI. this is a common host response to different viruses capable of eliciting pulmonary TCD8 impairment and PD-1 upregulation. matured bone marrow-derived DCs are potent antigen-presenting cells. they traffic to draining LNs to prime naive TCD8 (47, 48) DCs were loaded with M195 peptide and administered i.n. to recapitulate the route of infection utilized by respiratory viruses. i.n. immunization with M195-DCs resulted in an even greater, 35-fold reduction in viral titers compared with unimmunized mice. i.n. immunization with M195-DCs resulted in an even greater, 35-fold reduction in viral titers as compared with unimmunized mice. mice infected with HMPV and then challenged i.n. with M195-DCs several weeks R-immunized mice were either unchallenged or HMPV challenged. M195-immunized mice mounted a robust secondary response to the M195 epitope. PD-1 expression on A34R-specific TCD8 was similarly low in unchallenged and challenged mice. mice were immunized i.n. with VACV A34R-loaded or HMPV M195-loaded DCs. mice were harvested at either day 14 after immunization (A34R immunization) or day 7 after HMPV challenge (both A34R and M195 immunizations) antigen-dependent TCR signaling is sufficient for PD-1 upregulation. PD-L1 expression increased 4-fold by day 5 after infection and 10-fold by day 7. PD-L1 expression increased early during viral infection but not during DC immunization. blockade or ablation of PD-1 signaling prevents pulmonary TCD8 functional impairment during acute viral LRI. anti\u2013PD-L resulted in a greater percentage of M195-specific TCD8 in the spleens of infected animals. IL-17A and the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF- were unchanged. prevention of pulmonary TCD8 impairment and augmentation of cytokine levels resulted in enhanced viral clearance. blocking PD-1 ligation prevents functional impairment of pulmonary TCD8 during HMPV infection. data in A\u2013E are combined from 2 or 3 independent experiments with 4\u20135 individual mice per group per experiment. data in F and G are representative of 2 independent experiments with 5 mice per group. anti\u2013PD-L was not associated with increased lung histopathology. /\u2013 mice had a higher percentage of splenic HMPV-specific TCD8. this translated to a greater percentage of functional pulmonary HMPV-specific TCD8 in PD-1\u2013/\u2013 mice. this translated to a greater percentage of functional pulmonary HMPV-specific TCD8 in PD-1\u2013/\u2013 mice. 28\u2013specific TCD8 response (A) and the lung F528 and H2-Kb/N11\u2013specific TCD8 responses (B) were quantified. the percentage of functional F528- or N11-specific lung TCD8 (C) and the absolute number of tetramer+ (D) and IFN-+ (E) epitope-specific cells were calculated. increased supernatant GzmB levels found in some studies may be attributable to increased degranulation and not increased production. more prolonged blockade of the PD-1 pathway may be necessary to increase TCD8 granzyme expression. PD-1 negatively regulates TCD8 during LRI caused by both HMPV and IAV. anti\u2013PD-L treatment improves secondary immune responses by overcoming TCD8 impairment during challenge infection. i.n. DC immunization elicits lung-infiltrating M195-specific TCD8 in the absence of infection. anti\u2013PD-L treatment improves secondary immune responses by overcoming TCD8 impairment during challenge infection. mice were either not immunized (HMPV only) or immunized i.n. with M195-loaded DCs. eighteen days later, mice were challenged with HMPV. PD-1 and PD-L1 are expressed in the lower airways of patients with severe 2009 H1N1 pandemic IAV or RSV. both 2009 H1N1 pandemic IAV and RSV caused pronounced lung pathology, including severe pneumonia (Figure 10B) and bronchiolitis (Figure 10C), with extensive TCD8 infiltration (Figure 10C) anti\u2013PD-1 (H\u2013K), or anti\u2013PD-L1 (L\u2013S) antibodies were used as positive controls. \"Lung control\" (A, E, I, M, and Q) is from a patient with non-pulmonary disease. \"2009 H1N1 case\" (B, F, J, N, and R) is from a 12-year old patient with 2009 H1N1 pandemic IAV infection. images represent serially cut lung sections stained with H&E or anti-CD3 and are representative of 3\u20135 individual mice per time point. original magnification, 200 (days 1\u20135); 100 (day 7). data in B are representative of 3 experiments. tetramer staining enumerates total epitope-specific TCD8 directly ex vivo. epitope restimulation followed by intracellular cytokine staining. in the spleen, we observed a high concordance between tetramer staining and CD107a mobilization or IFN- production in TCD8 at all time points. enumerate the TCD8 response directed against the M195 epitope. numbers indicate the percentage of CD8+ T cells that either bind to M195 tetramer or respond to restimulation with M195 peptide. CD8 expressed granzyme B (GzmB), which were predominantly M195 tetramer+. about two-thirds of M195-specific TCD8 were GzmB+, far fewer produced IFN-, and even fewer produced TNF- or IL-2. pulmonary HMPV-specific TCD8 were impaired in multiple key effector functions. PD-1 expression was indistinguishable between different TCR V families. prolonged PD-1 expression by a polyclonal lung TCD8 population was associated with impairment. viral infection is required for pulmonary TCD8 impairment and PD-1 upregulation. mice were immunized i.n. with M195 peptide-loaded, LPS-matured DCs. the lung TCD8 response (A) and PD-1 expression (D) were quantified. PD-1 expression on total lung CD8+ lymphocytes and epitope-specific CD8+ T cells are shown. M195-specific TCD8 were detected in the lung by day 5 after immunization. the same time HMPV-specific TCD8 arrived in the lung following HMPV infection. mice were DC immunized either s.c. or i.n. to determine if DC-elicited TCD8 provide protection against subsequent challenge infection. i.n. DC immunization elicits unimpaired, PD-1lo TCD8 directly in the lung environment. i.n. DC-immunized mice were either unchallenged or HMPV challenged. i.n. DC immunization elicits unimpaired, PD-1lo TCD8. M195-immunized HMPV-challenged mice mounted a robust secondary response to the M195 epitope, but their TCD8 were the most severely impaired. the degree of impairment in each group correlated with PD-1 levels. PD-1 expression on A34R-specific TCD8 was similarly low in unchallenged and challenged mice. expression is shown as either representative histograms, percentage positive, or MFI. the M195-specific TCD8 response (D) and PD-1 expression (E) following repeated peptide administration were quantified. PD-L1 expression increased 4-fold by day 5 after infection and 10-fold by day 7. PD-L1 expression increased early during viral infection but not during DC immunization. PD-L1 expression increased in lungs upon viral infection but not during DC immunization. anti\u2013PD-L1 resulted in a greater percentage of M195-specific TCD8 in the spleens of infected animals. the percentage of functional M195-specific cells increased from 65% to 95% CD107a+. anti\u2013PD-L also augmented the amount of IFN- synthesized in spleen and lung M195-specific TCD8. -1 ligation prevents functional impairment of pulmonary TCD8 during HMPV infection. the percentage of functional M195-specific pulmonary TCD8 was calculated by dividing the percentage of CD8+ cells that were either CD107a+ or IFN-+ by the percentage of cells that were tetramer+. anti\u2013PD-L was not associated with increased lung histopathology. despite increased level of proinflammatory cytokines and functional TCD8, anti\u2013PD-L was not associated with increased lung histopathology. however, we used a mouse oximeter to quantify airway dysfunction. IFN- and TNF- cytokine levels were significantly elevated in the lungs of PD-1\u2013/\u2013 mice. IL-10 and IL-17A were trending upward and IL-6 and TGF- were unchanged. PD-1 signaling functions to prevent immunopathology during acute viral LRI. PD-1\u2013/\u2013 mice were either H&E or anti-CD3 stained. images are representative of 4 individual mice per group. lack of PD-1 signaling did not exacerbate airway dysfunction. PD-1 negatively regulates TCD8 during LRI caused by both HMPV and IAV. recovery is delayed in PD-1\u2013/\u2013 mice. primary HMPV infection elicits sterilizing immunity. we employed i.n. DC immunization to elicit lung-infiltrating M195-specific TCD8 in the absence of infection. pulmonary TCD8 impairment during both primary and secondary infection is mediated by PD-1. mice were either not immunized (HMPV only) or immunized i.n. with M195-loaded DCs. eighteen days later, mice were challenged with HMPV. PD-1 expression of lung M195-specific TCD8 quantified. PD-1 was detected on small lymphocytes and macrophages present in the airway and interstitium. PD-L1 was expressed on alveolar and bronchiolar epithelial cells. PD-L1 was detected in 3 of 4 2009 H1N1 cases, 2 of 3 RSV cases and 1 of 1 PIV-3 case. mic IAV infection and \"RSV case\" is from an 18-month-old child with RSV infection. PD-1/PD-L1 pathway mediates this impairment during murine acute viral LRI. both dominant and subdominant epitope-specific TCD8 were impaired. splenic TCD8 were unimpaired and downregulated PD-1 over time. splenic TCD8 were unimpaired and PD-1lo even during HMPV challenge. regulation and expression of PD-L1 contributes significantly to impairment during acute viral LRI. in vitro, both HMPV and IAV infection of human bronchial epithelial cells resulted in PD-L1 upregulation. PD-L1 expression correlated with viral replication and induction of adaptive immune response. pulmonary TCD8 impairment is preventable, indicating novel therapeutic avenue for acute viral LRIs. disruption of PD-1 signaling via therapeutic antibody blockade preserved TCD8 effector functions and decreased viral titers. direct manipulation of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway has so far proven safe and at least partially effective against both hematologic malignancies (30) and solid tumors (31) in humans and against SIV in non-human primates. cytokine therapies that indirectly overcome PD-1 signaling also hold therapeutic promise (64, 65) human airway epithelial cells upregulate PD-L1 and PD-L2 in response to IFN- and TNF- in vitro (27, 68) and to human rhinovirus infection in vivo (69). PD-L would be poised to impair airway-resident memory T cells as well as newly recruited cells. results suggest that memory TCD8 may be similarly, if not more, affected by PD-1 signaling than naive cells. influenza virus strains A/34/PR/8 (PR8; H1N1; ATCC) and HK/x31 (x31; H3N2; provided by Jon McCullers, St. Jude Children\u2019s Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA) were grown in MDCK cells and titered on LLC-MK2 cells. for all experiments, mice were anesthetized with ketamine-xylazine and infected i.n. with 1.5 106 the top approximately 80 HLA-B*0702\u2013, 40 H2-Db\u2013, and 40 H2-Kb\u2013restricted 8- to 10-amino-acid-long predictopes were synthesized for HLA-B*0702 (by Mimotopes) or H2b (by Genscript) to greater than 95% purity. the mitogen concanavalin A (ConA, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a positive control, while stimulation lungs were minced with a scalpel and incubated with 2 mg/ml collagenase A (Roche) and 20 g/ml DNase (Roche) for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C. single-cell suspensions of digested lungs or whole spleens were obtained by pressing through a steel screen. 2 106 to 3 106 lymphocytes were added to each well of a 96-well round-bottom plate (Falcon) lymphocytes were first stained with violet LIVE/DEAD dye (Invitrogen) then Fc blocked with 1 g per 106 cells anti-CD16/32 (BD Biosciences), then incubated with PE- or APC-labeled tetramers (0.1\u20131 g/ml), anti-CD8 (clone 53 Flow cytometry data were collected using an LSR II (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with FlowJo software (Tree Star). tetramer staining, lung or spleen lymphocytes isolated from the same mice were restimulated in vitro for 6 hours at 37\u00b0C. intranasal immunization with 3 105 peptide-loaded, LPS-matured lung CD11c+ DCs elicited unimpaired, PD-1lo epitope-specific TCD8. however, because of the need for large numbers of naive mice to obtain a sufficient quantity of pulmonary DCs, bone marrow\u2013derived DCs were employed for all immunization experiments. mice were immunized i.n. with 2 106 peptide-loaded, LPS-matured DCs. some mice were then challenged as described in figure legends. the same procedure was used to isolate lung lymphocytes from mice. primers and probes were previously published (80) for PD-L1 gene expression. all values were normalized to the housekeeping gene Hprt. experimental samples are reported as fold change in PD-L1 compared with that in mice that were mock infected using the Ct method. mouse lungs were inflated with 10% formalin and fixed overnight. samples were then paraffin embedded and sectioned at 5-m thickness. paraffin was removed from the slides and baked overnight at 50\u00b0C. the slides were counterstained lightly with Mayer\u2019s hematoxylin. the slides were counterstained lightly with Mayer\u2019s hematoxylin, dehydrated, and coverslipped. 12-week-old age- and sex-matched animals were used in all experiments. influenza virus strains A/34/PR/8 and HK/x31 were grown in MDCK cells. x31 was used in experiments with PD-1\u2013/\u2013 mice because it induced a more robust CD8+ T cell response than PR8. the top approximately 80 HLA-B*0702\u2013, 40 H2-Db\u2013, and 40 H2-Kb\u2013restricted 8- to 10-amino-acid-long predictopes were synthesized for HLA-B*0702 (by Mimotopes) or H2b (by Genscript) to greater than 95% purity. the mitogen concanavalin A (ConA, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a positive control, while stimulation UV-mediated exchange of conditional peptide with virus-derived peptides and quantification of peptide exchange were conducted as previously described (76). tetramers were generated for the following viral epitopes: HMPV (HLA-B*0702/M195\u2013203 [APYAGLIMI], HLA-B*0702/N198\u2013206 [YPRMDIPKI], H2-Db/F528\u2013536 [SGVTNNGFI], H2-K 2 106 to 3 106 lymphocytes were added to each well of a 96-well round-bottom plate (Falcon) Lymphocytes were first stained with violet LIVE/DEAD dye (Invitrogen) then Fc blocked with 1 g per 106 cells anti-CD16/32 (BD Biosciences), and finally incubated with PE- or APC-labeled tetramers (0.1\u20131 g/ml), anti-CD8 (clon Flow cytometry data were collected using an LSR II (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with FlowJo software (Tree Star). tetramer staining, lung or spleen lymphocytes isolated from the same mice were restimulated in vitro for 6 hours at 37\u00b0C. intranasal immunization with 3 105 peptide-loaded, LPS-matured lung CD11c+ DCs elicited unimpaired, PD-1lo epitope-specific TCD8. however, because of the need for large numbers of naive mice to obtain sufficient quantity of pulmonary DCs, bone marrow\u2013derived DCs were employed for all immunization experiments. mice were immunized i.n. with 2 106 peptide-loaded, LPS-matured DCs. some mice were then challenged as described in the figure legends. primers and probe targeting the HMPV N gene were previously published (80) for PD-L1 gene expression, exon-spanning primers and probes were obtained and used according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. experimental samples are reported as fold change in PD-L1 compared with that in mice that were mock infected using the Ct method. IVE/DEAD stained mice with anti\u2013human PD-L1 antibody (clone MIH1, BD Biosciences) or isotype control for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0C. the fold increase in PD-L1 expression relative mock infection was determined by flow cytometry. samples were then incubated with mouse anti\u2013human PD-L1 antibody (clone MIH1, BD Biosciences) anti-PD-1 (clone 7A11B1, Sigma-Aldrich) and anti-CD8 antibodies (clone C8/144B, Thermo Scientific) were used as primary antibodies. the slides were counterstained lightly with Mayer\u2019s hematoxylin, dehydrated, and coverslipped. the slides were then inflated with 10% formalin and fixed overnight. -L1 (clone 29E.2A3, BioLegend), anti\u2013PD-1 (clone 7A11B1, Sigma-Aldrich), and anti-CD8 antibodies (clone C8/144B, Thermo Scientific) were used as primary antibodies. the slides were counterstained lightly with Mayer\u2019s hematoxylin, dehydrated, and coverslipped."}
