{"summary": "a wide spectrum of mammalian cells exhibit cytopathic effects (CPEs) after the virus invades host cells. the first line of cellular defense involves the activation of pathogen-associated molecular patterns by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including toll-like receptors, nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors, and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors. high-throughput RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) technology has the advantages of broad genome coverage, speed, low-cost, high precision, and unbiased quantification of transcript expression. transcriptome analysis via RNA-Seq can reveal all RNA transcripts in tissues or cells and further elucidate expression of genes in specific tissues or cells. no CPEs were observed in mock-infected cells. mock-infected DEFs showed nearly 100% viability at 12 and 24 hpi. sample Raw Reads Clean Reads Clean Data (%) Q20 (%) Q30 (%) Total Mapped (%) 12hD1 82,525,576 81,938,158 99.28 97.70 94.29 76.51 12hD2 82,444,204 81,830,302 99.25 97.66 94.24 77.84 12hD3 82,505,912 81,871,548 99.23 97. mock-infected cells (i.e., 12D and 24D) were clearly distinct from those infected with DTMUV (i.e., 12S and 24S) the correlation coefficients were proportional to the time post-infection; samples at 12 hpi did not cluster with those at 24 hpi. the details of the DEGs are listed in Table S1. 2.4.

DTMUV was sensed by PRRs in DEFs, and various immune molecules were efficiently induced. but these cytokines could not inhibit DTMUV replication in DEFs. it is well-known that the transcription of innate immune molecules depends on activation of several transcriptional factors. inactivation of NF-B or disruption of IRF7 could significantly reduce productions of type I and type III IFN. these highly expressed transcriptional factors provide favorable conditions for the high production of ILs, IFNs, and chemotactic factors. dsorption at 37 \u00b0C in a 5% CO2 incubator was replaced with maintenance medium. the inoculum was harvested at 12 and 24 hpi, respectively. all animal experiments were performed according to the guidelines of the committee on ethics of animals of Shandong and the appropriate biosecurity. defs samples were collected at 12 and 24 hpi (three replicates each) and rapidly stored at 80 \u00b0C until further use. integrity and concentration of RNA samples were checked using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA, USA) the clean data were assembled de novo into unigenes using Trinity software (http://trinityrnaseq.sf.net) [49], and the key parameters of clean data were also calculated. the assembled unigenes were then mapped to the Peking duck reference genome (duckbase.refseq.v4.fa, http://www.duckbase.org/Download) using topHat2 software (version 2.1.1, Baltimore, MD, USA) [50 nine DEGs were randomly selected for quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) using the specific primers. each 20-L reaction mixture contained 0.5 L of each primer, 1 L of DNA template, 10 L of 2Trans Strat\u00ae Top Green qPCR Super Mix and 8.0 L of ddH2O. q and qRT-PCR data using the SAS 9.1 software (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA) 4.7.
