{"summary": "interferon inducible trans-membrane protein 3 (IFITM3) is a double trans-membrane protein that belongs to the IFITM family members. it is involved in interferon-triggered processes, such as anti-proliferative activities of different pathogenesis, antivirus infections in innate immune response, cell adhesion, cell apoptosis, and germ cell homing. swine IFITM3 gene was mainly isolated from severely inflamed mucosa. it increased in gastric cancer, colorectal tumors, and colorectal tumors. previous studies have shown that toll like receptor 4 may play a major role in various inflammatory diseases. TS Characterization and expression pattern of IFITM3 gene We searched the predicted IFITM3 CDS in the NCBI database. the length of IFITM3 CDS is 438 bp, and encodes 145 amino acids. we clearly observed the green fluorescence in the transfected PBIFM3 and PBv, but not in the non-transfected PK15 cells. this results indicated that vectors with the GFP gene were successfully transfected into cells and integrated into the genome. mRNA abundance in swine IFITM3 cells was notably higher than that in PBv cells (p 0.0001). these data noted that the IFITM3 expression can be up-regulated in inflammatory response. PBIFM3 and PBv cells stimulated with or without LPS (100 g/ml) for 4, 8, 12 h. cells in 0 h (control group) were cultured in basal medium. swine IFITM3 was involved in the TLR4-NFB signaling pathway. results showed that IFITM3 mRNA was expressed in all 13 tissues. spleen and lung, while the IFITM3 mRNA in heart and ileum was hardly detected (Figure 2). these differential expression implicated that IFITM3 might be involved in the functional regulation of immunity. we then constructed the eukaryotic expression vector PBIFM3. green fluorescence was observed clearly using fluorescence microscopy in the PBv (B), and PBIFM3 (C) cells, but not in non-transfected PK15 cells (A). swine IFITM3 expression in inflammatory response LPS is the most commonly used experimental inflammatory factor. IFN was significantly up-regulated in the PBIFM3 and PBv cells. however, IFN abundance in PBIFM3 cells was lower than that in PBv cells. similar results were also observed in the change of IFN expression. swine IFITM3 overexpression suppressed the inflammatory development of PK15 cells. the levels of TNF and NFB reached peak 4 h after LPS treatment. however, the change of TBK1 expression had no significance correlation with LPS treatment time. cDNA of swine IFITM3 from lymph node tissue encodes 145 amino acids residues. the length of swine IFITM3 gene was also 438 bp, encoding 145 amino acids residues. IFITM3 has been reported to participate in adhesion, apoptosis, immune response, growth and development. the IFITM3 mRNA abundance was hardly detected in ileum (Figure 2). we considered that different intestine and pathological grades may be the major reason resulting in the differential result. however, some studies indicated that IFITM3 was necessary to regulate the complex IFN- response. p38 MAPK activates a wide range of transcription factors, protein kinases, cytosolic and nuclear proteins. TBK1 mediates the activation of interferon regulatory factor, leading to the induction of type I IFNs. PB vector and PB transposes were obtained from TaKaRa Bio Inc. (Shiga, China) a total of 13 tissues samples including skin, muscle, fat, heart, liver, spleen, kidney, lung, dudens, jejunum, ileum, cecum, rectum from 5 healthy swines were collected. IFITM3 fragment was amplified using trizol reagent (TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan), and RNA was then used for cDNA synthesis. the final PCR product was isolated by electrophoresis using 1 % polyacrylamide gels. plasmid solution was subject to agarose gel electrophoresis to confirm the presence of the correct sequence of IFITM3. PB-IFITM3 cDNA was subcloned from pMD19-T-IFITM3 into the PB vector after double restriction enzyme digestion. PB-IFITM3 cDNA (438 bp length) was subcloned from pMD19-T-IFITM3 into the PB vector. PK15 cells were plated at the density 2105 cells per well in six-well plates. the cells were transfected with PB-IFITM3 and in parallel with empty vector. after 12 h of transfection, the images were captured using a dual mode cooled charged coupled device (CCD) camera. cDNA synthesis and PCR Cells were seeded in a 6 well plates at 2105 cells/well and treated with LPS at the concentration of 100 g/mL. after 4, 8 and 12 h incubation, total RNA was extracted from cultured cells using a reverse transcriptase kit. P-values less than 0.05 were taken to indicate statistically significant differences. PB vector and PB transposes were obtained from TaKaRa Bio Inc. swine tissues using trizol reagent (TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan) were amplified. the final PCR product was isolated by electrophoresis. the purified target fragment was ligated into the plasmid pMD19-T. plasmid solution was subject to agarose gel electrophoresis. PB-IFITM3 cDNA (438 bp length) was subcloned from pMD19-T-IFITM3 into the PB vector after double restriction enzyme digestion. the obtained recombinant expression vector was called PB-IFITM3. cell culture, transfection, and photograph PK15 porcine kidney epithelial cells. PK15 cells were plated at density 2105 cells per well in six-well plates. cells were divided into three groups: PB-IFITM3, PB-vector and non-transfection. cDNA synthesis and PCR Cells were seeded in a 6 well plates at 2105 cells/well and treated with LPS at the concentration of 100 g/mL. after 4, 8 and 12 h incubation, total RNA was extracted from cultured cells using a reverse transcriptase kit. values less than 0.05 were taken to indicate statistically significant differences."}
