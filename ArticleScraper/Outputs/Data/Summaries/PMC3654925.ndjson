{"summary": "toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular protozoan that belongs to Phylum Apicomplexa. the parasite has a heteroxenous life cycle, with different warm blood species, including humans, serving as intermediate hosts that sustain replication of its asexual forms. domestic and wild felines are the definitive hosts that develop sexual stages of the parasite in the gut. the development of vaccines against T. gondii is an important alternative for disease control [10], [11]. the development of vaccines against T. gondii is an important alternative for disease control [10], [11]. the recombinant adenovirus is a well-characterized viral vector that has been used to express antigens from a number of infectious agents. it has been safely tested in various immunization protocols with a wide range of hosts, including humans, resulting in different degrees of immune response and protection. the defect in the morphogenetic program that rendered the MVA incapable of replicating does not alter the expression of recombinant antigens in mammalian cells. the defect in the morphogenetic program that rendered the MVA incapable of replicating does not alter the expression of recombinant antigens in mammalian cells compared to replication-competent Vaccinia virus [38]. adenovirus encoding the same antigen was used in a heterologous prime-boost protocol in combination with the adenovirus encoding the same antigen. the protocol of this study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee from FIOCRUZ, Brazil. fetal bovine serum (FBS) was obtained from GIBCO (CA, USA) the antibodies and streptoavidin-peroxidase conjugate were obtained from eBioscience (CA, USA) the antibodies used for intracellular staining of TNF- were purchased from eBioscience (CA, USA);

Statistical Analysis Mortality curves of different immunized groups after infection with ME49 strain were compared using Chi-Square test. to compare the number of spots, percentage of cytokine secreting cells and levels of secreted cytokines we used two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni\u2019s post-test. plasmid pLW44 was used as shuttle vector for recombination with wild-type MVA genome. the Sag1 coding sequence was subcloned in the SmaI site of plasmid pLW44 under control of the promoter mH5. the presence of recombinant MVA virus is indicated by expression of green fluorescence (FITC channel) mice were immunized according to a homologous protocol consisting of two doses of adenovirus or were submitted to a heterologous protocol, with one prime dose of adenovirus followed by one dose of MVA. serum samples were tested in Western blot, using total tachyzoite lysate (TLA) as antigen. animals were vaccinated according to homologous (Adeno+Adeno) or heterologous (Adeno+MVA) protocol. splenocytes were vaccinated with viral vectors expressing the antigen SAG1 of T.gondii. spleens from animals that received the viruses encoding SAG1 showed higher frequencies of CD4+ T cells that produced TNF- (figure 3A) and IFN- (figure 3B) in comparison to control-vaccinated mice. the difference between protocols did not reach the level of statistical significance. total spleen cells were obtained two weeks after vaccination. stimulated cells were stained for CD4+ T cell markers and intracellular TNF- and IFN- and analyzed in flow cytometry. the supernatant of stimulated cells were tested for presence of secreted cytokines in ELISA. the bar graphs on the left show the medianrange of 3 animals tested individually. the plots on the right show the response to SP0534 of one representative animal of each SAG1-vaccinated group. mice were immunized with two doses of recombinant viruses. two weeks later, animals were challenged with an oral dose of 10 cysts of ME49. asterisks indicate significant differences between vaccinated and control-vaccinated groups. newly obtained recombinant viruses were submitted to seven rounds of selection, to eliminate contamination with the wild type virus. expression of the SAG1 protein by the recombinant viruses was confirmed by Western blot assay with extracts of infected CEFs. lysate of cells infected with a control MVA

heterologous AdSAG1 109 s.c. 4 MVACTRL 107 i.m. s.c. vaccinated mice with viral vectors expressing antigen SAG1 of T.gondii. the experiment was performed two times, independently. spleens from animals that received the viruses encoding SAG1 showed higher frequencies of CD4+ T cells that produced TNF- and IFN-. assay confirms increased frequency of IFN- secreting specific cells in heterologous-vaccinated spleens. spleen cells were obtained two weeks after vaccination and cultured in plain complete medium (Med) or with the MHCI-restricted. peptide SP0534, derived from SAG1 was stained for CD8+ T cell markers and intracellular TNF- and IFN- and analyzed in flow cytometry. the supernatant of stimulated cells was tested for presence of secreted cytokines in ELISA. the bar graphs on the left show the medianrange of 3 animals tested individually. mice from heterologous vaccination groups developed a significantly lower (p0.01) number of brain cysts in comparison to animals from homologous vaccination groups. mice were immunized with two doses of recombinant viruses according to the homologous or heterologous protocol. two weeks later, animals were challenged with an oral dose of 10 cysts of ME49. our strategy for development of an anti-toxoplasmosis recombinant vaccine has been the generation of viral vectors expressing T. gondii antigens. most of our work has centered in the surface protein SAG1, which is expressed in tachyzoites, and mediates adhesion of the parasite to the surface of the host cell prior invasion. protection was correlated with the capacity of AdSAG1 in activating CD8+ T cell-mediated responses, in a mechanism dependent on myD88 innate signaling and IL-12 production. anti-vector immunity can be induced by natural exposition of hosts to the wild type viruses that are used as base for construction of the vectors. in the last years, MVA has become a very popular recombinant viral vector for the development of immunization protocols. this vector is capable to activate both humoral and cellular immune responses against the heterologous gene. this vector is capable to activate both humoral and cellular immune responses against the heterologous gene. this difference does not seem to be related to the vaccine-induced humoral response, as all SAG1-immunized groups developed similar levels of IgG1 and IgG2c antibodies. adenovirus-MVA heterologous vaccination protocols resulted in activation of polyfunctional T cells that produced IFN-, TNF- and IL-2, which was not observed in the homologous vaccination. some studies have shown that CTLs are involved in cyst control during T. gondii infection, in a mechanism mediated by perforin. the initial assays failed to detect any CTL activity, in both homologous and heterologous protocols. further investigation is necessary to determine the status of CTL activity in our vaccination model. the CD4+ cells and CD8+ cells were gated in the single cell population by plotting perCP-Cy5.5 (CD4 stain) against PE (IFN- stain) C, TNF- producing CD4+ T cells were identified by plotting APC-CyTM 7 (CD8 stain) against PE-CyTM 7 (TNF- stain)."}
