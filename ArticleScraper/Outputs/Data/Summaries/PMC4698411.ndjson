{"summary": "30% of children and 70% of adults in the united states are now overweight or obese (90). despite substantial investments, the cardiovascular research community is poised to fall far short of the highly publicized American Heart Association 2020 Impact Goal. the 7.2 kcal/day estimate highlights the sensitivity and reliability of the physiological systems in place to control energy balance. the RAS is integrally involved in the regulation of all aspects of energy balance, but also that this control is mediated through complex, opposing, and tissue-specific actions. obesity is due to an imbalance between energy \u201cinput\u201d and \u201coutput\u201d. liraglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist that was approved in 2014. it likely works through suppressing appetite, but its complete mechanism is not yet documented. the RAS is known to modulate food intake behavior. new colocalization studies have documented expression of AT2 receptors with GABA- and acetylcholine-synthetic enzymes in brain regions well recognized as contributing to ingestive behavior. however, various studies have implicated AT1 receptor subtypes and its second-messenger systems in the control of sodium intake behavior. orlistat (tetrahydrolipstatin) is the longest-running FDA-approved antiobesity drug available in the united states. it is approved for prescription use in 1999 and now sold over the counter as Alli. it has been suggested that the major mechanism of weight loss in human users is actually the learned avoidance of fatty foods. weight gain in wild-type mice with 45% high-fat diet was suppressed in a dose-dependent manner by dietary sodium. this was not mediated through any changes in food intake, physical activity, or resting metabolism. chronic infusion reversed the digestive efficiency-suppressing effect of high dietary sodium. mice harboring a null allele for angiotensinogen exhibit altered spontaneous locomotor activity. adipose-specific manipulation of angiotensinogen also exhibit altered spontaneous locomotor activity. however, further studies are needed to better understand this effect. the single most potent antiobesity drug ever used clinically was 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) this compound is a mitochondrial proton ionophore, acting as an artificial uncoupling protein to destroy the proton gradient across the inner membrane of mitochondria (125). the drug indiscriminately affects all cell types and exhibits highly undesirable pharmacokinetic properties that can lead to cataracts and even death. genetic deletion of renin (127), ACE (65), the angiotensin AT1A receptor (70) and the angiotensin AT2 receptor (147) are all associated with increased RMR. pharmacological inhibition of ACE by captopril (137) or antagonism of AT1A receptors by candesartan (150) both appear to increase RMR. ipose RAS also has a major suppressive effect on \u201cnonaerobic\u201d RMR (11) such findings are strikingly similar to those reported from humans by Pittet et al. (102, 103). mass follows a simple positive scaling function by a factor of 1018 (39) before the late 2000s brown fat had not yet been identified in adult humans. molecular analyses have aimed to clarify the identity and understand the function of such \u201cbrown/beige/brite\u201d adipose in humans. indiscriminant RAS inhibition on obesity in humans is rooted in the established independent (and occasionally opposing) effects of local paracrine tissue versions of the RAS versus the circulating hormone version of this system. delivery of angiotensin II into the brain results in increased RMR and reduced body mass (26, 104, 105) the failure of whole body RAS inhibition to oppose obesity in humans stems from the effects of anti-RAS compounds to simultaneously modulate both stimulatory and inhibitory tissue-specific mechanisms. indiscriminately activating or suppressing the RAS may have no net effect on energy balance, yet the cardiovascular system may pay a hefty price for such stimulation. pril exhibits low permeability through the BBB in normotensive Wistar rats. lisinopril and benazepril also exhibit low permeability through the BBB. losartan, irbesartan, and telmisartan all exhibit much lower permeability. rats exhibit increased BBB permeability, and a nondepressor dose of olmesartan reduces permeability (98, 99) candesartan also reduces BBB permeability (74, 97) a dysfunctional BBB during obesity and obesity-related hypertension may eliminate beneficial compartmentalization of RAS hyper- versus hypoactivity. a dysfunctional BBB during obesity may eliminate beneficial compartmentalization of RAS hyper- versus hypoactivity, resulting in loss of tissue-specific metabolic control by the RAS. hypothesized mechanism for the uncoupling of resting metabolic rate control by the circulating RAS, leading to obesity-related hypertension. increased adiposity causes increases in leptin and the circulating RAS. increased BP causes a reflexive suppression of the circulating RAS. a relatively simple model of the pathogenesis of obesity and obesity-related hypertension may result from opposing, tissue-specific effects of the RAS on energy balance. the RAS is involved in the control or regulation of all of the cardinal metabolic processes (food intake behavior, digestive efficiency, physical activity, and resting metabolism); the production of RAS components by (and action upon) adipose tissue may ultimately explain the pathogenesis of obesity. edited and revised manuscript; N.K.L. and J.L.G. approved final version of manuscript."}
