{"summary": "a series of symptoms and consequences caused by the influenza virus are not caused by the direct action of the influenza virus itself but are rather due to the inflammatory injury caused by the excessive activation of the immune response induced by an influenza virus infection. the modest cytokine response contributes to the induction of antiviral and Th1-type immune responses in the body. in 1918, the \u201cSpanish flu\u201d also caused fatal inflammatory damage to the lung tissue. this inflammatory injury is both an important cause of death due to influenza virus infection and a major cause of lung infections caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), sepsis, and aspiration pneumonia. immunosuppressive agents (e.g., glucocorticoids) are often used in clinical practice to inhibit inflammatory cytokine responses, thereby blocking disease progression. IGF1 mainly functions by binding to IGF1R, a transmembrane protein composed of two domains and two domains. the domain binds to IGF1 to activate the domain (Siddle et al., 2001). the levels of serum IGF1 protein in patients with type 2 diabetes are significantly higher than those in healthy people. in non-autoimmune inflammatory contact dermatitis, IGF1 recruits anti-inflammatory proteins to protect nerve cells from degeneration. the human alveolar epithelial cell line A549 is particularly sensitive to influenza virus infection and has been widely used as a good in vitro model to study influenza virus for nearly 20 years. the cell line was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, USA) and propagated in 9- to 11-day-old SPF chicken embryos. pcDNA3.1-IGF1 vector was transfected into a549 cells with LiPO2000. the cell line overexpressing IGF1 was screened with G418 (500 g/ml) the human IGF1 shRNA lentiviral particles were purchased from Santa Cruz Company. a 30 g protein sample was obtained for polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the total cellular protein was quantified using a bicinchoninic acid. protein was quantified using the Whole Cell Lysate (Beijing ComWin, Cat: CW0074) containing a protease inhibitor cocktail. a 50 g protein sample was obtained for PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane. mice were induced into a deep anesthetic state and administered a nasal inhalation of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or PR8. in the PR8 + IGF1 group, IGF1 was intraperitoneally injected 6 h before infection. after infection, IGF1 was intraperitoneally injected every 24 h. changes in the clinical symptoms of mice were observed daily. injury conditions and Lung Index After removing the whole lung tissue of the mice, damage to the lung tissue was observed. the degree of lung injury visible to the naked eye was dark red due to edema. each sample was estimated by at least three different individuals. the allantoic fluid was collected and titrated to determine the 50% tissue culture infection dose (TCID50) in A549 cells and the median lethal dose (LD50) in mice following the Reed-Muench method. specific pathogen free (SPF) grade female BALB/c mice aged 6\u20138 weeks (body weight: 18\u201320 g) were purchased from the Experimental Animal Center of the Military Medical Research Institute. primer sequence of matrix protein 1 (M1) was forward: 5\u2032-GACCRATCCTGTCACCTCTGAC-3\u2032; Reverse: 5\u2032-GGGCATTYTGGACAAAKCGTCTACG-3\u2032. the results were analyzed using the 2Ct method. the total cellular protein was quantified using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit. a 30 g protein sample was obtained for polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. level of cytokine expression was detected using mouse IGF1 ELISA Kit, IL-6 ELISA Kit, TNF- ELISA Kit, IFN- ELISA Kit, and IL-1 ELISA Kit. cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and subsequently infected with PR8 at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.5 or 1.0. the blood was taken by excising the eyeballs and the lung tissues were collected. the blood was kept at room temperature for 1 h and centrifuged at 11,000 g for 15 min. the serum was collected and aliquoted and stored at 80\u00b0C for later use. IGF1 expression was upregulated in A549 cells infected with influenza A virus PR8. levels of IGF1 mRNA and protein expression were detected at 12, 24, 48, and 72 h post-infection. level of IGF1 mRNA expression peaked at 48 h post-infection, 6.35 0.30 times higher than that of the Mock controls. compared with the Mock group, the level of IGF1 protein expression peaked 1.82 times at 48 h after PR8 infection at a MOI of 0.5. the level of IGF1 protein expression reached 2.26 times that of the Mock group at 48 h post-infection. stably transfected A549 cells were infected with PR8 at a MOI of 0.5. IGF1 overexpression further increased the level of cytokine mRNA expression. levels of cytokine expression in the cells with IGF1 knocked down. lowest CCL2 and TNF- mRNA of PR8 + Lenti + shIGF1 group downregulated to less than half that of the uninfected Mock group. results indicate that overexpression of IGF1 aggravated the inflammatory response induced by influenza virus infection. inhibition of IGF1 expression can alleviate this inflammatory response. the level of IGF1 mRNA expression in the lung tissue gradually increased at days 3, 5, and 7 after PR8 infection. on day 7 post-infection, IGF1 mRNA increased to 5.81 0.623 times that of the control group. a Western blot was used to detect changes in IGF1 protein expression in the lung tissue following PR8 infection. IGF1 regulates acute inflammatory lung injury in PR8-infected mice. mice were randomly divided into four groups: (1) PBS; (2) PR8 + IGF1; (3) PR8+ PPP; and(4) PR8 + PBS. the symptoms of the PR8 + IGF1 group were more severe than those of the PR8 + PBS group. the PR8 + PPP group showed milder clinical symptoms than that of the PR8 + PBS group. the survival rate of the PR8 + PPP group was dramatically increased up to 75% compared with the survival rate of the PR8 + PBS group was only 25%. the extent of lung injury in the PR8 + IGF1 group was significantly less severe than that of the PR8 + PBS group. the lung index of uninfected mice increased significantly from 1.953 0.074 to 2.515 0.121%. the area of lung injury also increased from 0.38 0.042 to 0.78 0.069, approximately twice that of the control group. if IGF1 regulates viral replication of IAV, qPCR was used to detect changes of the viral matrix protein 1 (M1) expression in the lungs of PR8-infected mice. however, the viral load in the lungs of the PR8 + IGF1 group was significantly increased to nearly two-fold of the PR8 + PBS group. c mice (n = 6, females, 6\u20138 weeks) were intranasally infected with PR8 (50LD50 PR8) the mice serum were examined for changes in (A) IFN- mRNA, (B) TNF- mRNA, (C) IL-1 mRNA, and (D) IL-6 mRNA. the administration of IGF1 protein following influenza virus infection promoted the activation of the PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling pathway. the results suggest that IGF1 affected the expression of key proteins associated with MAPK and the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in response to IAV-mediated inflammation. level of IGF1 mRNA expression in A549 cells peaked at 48 h post-infection. the level of IGF1 mRNA expression decreased slightly at 72 h post-infection. the level of IGF1 mRNA expression increased to 7.49 0.38 times that of the Mock group. grayscale analysis of Figure 1D was performed and plotted according to the ratio of the integrated density of IGF1/GAPDH. level of IGF1 protein expression was also upregulated at 12, 24, 48, and 72 h post-infection of PR8 (Figure 1C) level of IGF1 protein expression in the A549 cells following PR8 infection was consistent with the level of IGF1 mRNA. expression of IGF1 in the cells was inhibited by lentiviral packaged shRNA (Lenti + shIGF1) after which the level of IGF1 mRNA was reduced to 0.21 0.087 times that of the control group. the level of IGF1 protein was also increased in stable A549 cell line with pcDNA3.1-IGF1 and inhibited in stable A549 cell line with Lenti + shIGF1. inhibition of IGF1 expression can alleviate this inflammatory response. IGF1 regulates the expression of inflammatory cytokines in response to PR8 infection. the content of IGF1 in the serum of mice was detected by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) the content of IGF1 protein in the serum increased significantly on day 5 post-infection of PR8 and decreased on day 9. the results were consistent with the qPCR and Western blot findings. mice in the PR8 + IGF1 group were intranasally inoculated with 30 l influenza virus PR8 (50LD50) from 6 h before the inoculation to day 14 post-infection, the mice were intraperitoneally injected with IGF1 protein (20 g/kg/24 h); and the PR8 + PBS group was injected with PBS (30 l/24 h). the clinical symptoms of the mice were observed daily for 14 days, and changes in the survival rate of the PR8 + PPP group was dramatically increased up to 75% compared with the survival rate of the PR8 + PBS group was only 25%. the first death in the PR8 + IGF1 group was accelerated to day 5 post-infection. all mice have succumbed to the infection by day 8. the lung index of the PR8 + IGF1 group increased significantly from 1.953 0.074 to 2.515 0.121%. the area of lung injury also increased from 0.38 0.042 to 0.78 0.069. the level of inflammatory cell infiltration in the lung tissue of the PR8 + PBS group was greater than that of the PR8 + PBS group. the viral load in the lungs of the PR8 + IGF1 group was significantly increased to nearly two-fold of the PR8 + PBS group. however, the viral load of the PR8 + PPP group and the PR8 + PBS group was similar, indicating that IGF1 responded to influenza infection via the host immune response. the results further confirm that IGF1 induced an inflammatory response following influenza virus infection. a Western blot was used to detect the expression of molecules in key signaling pathways in the lung tissue of PR8-infected mice. each sample was from six mice in a group and was tested for three times. IGF1 expression was upregulated in A549 cells and BALB/c mice infected with PR8, which modulated inflammatory cytokine expression. phosphorylation of IGF1R triggered PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling pathways to induce inflammation. neutralizing antibodies can prevent the adsorption of the virus via opsonization. Activated Th1 cells release various cytokines (i.e., IFN- and TNF), activate macrophages and NK cells to induce further inflammatory reactions. inhibitor PPP was used to inhibit IGF1R function, thereby disrupting its downstream signaling capacity. the inhibition of IGF1 only affects the immune response but has no significant effect on IAV replication. this is consistent with previously reported effective treatments for influenza-mediated inflammation. p-AKT expression was upregulated in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. p-p38 and p-JNK expression were upregulated in the MAPK signaling pathway compared with the PBS group. there was no significant difference in the level of p-JNK expression between the groups infected with influenza virus. the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
