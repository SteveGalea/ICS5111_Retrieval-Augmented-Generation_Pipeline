{"summary": "the study of equine infectious diseases has been an early and important part of veterinary science. many equine viral diseases and their causative agents have been described by using classic virological methods, including equine influenza virus, west Nile virus (Toplu et al., 2015), equine encephalitis viruses, equine arteritis virus. a deep sequencing approach was used to characterize eukaryotic viral sequences in a variety of biological sample types from horses with diseases of suspected viral aetiology. twenty-two barcoded equine DNA libraries consisting of 57 samples from 34 horses were generated and sequenced. we detected viral sequences related to anellovirus, parvoviruses, herpesvirus, hepacivirus and circoviruses. the majority of viral sequences were highly divergent. the hepacivirus sequences showed 91\u201396 % nucleotide identity to the hepacivirus found in equine serum and liver. herpesvirus sequences with >80 % nucleotide identity to equid herpesvirus 2 genome were also identified. RT-nested PCR bridging Segment 1 and 2 was used to amplify a 500 bp amplicon. the expected size PCR product was sequenced and confirmed to be a junction between both segments. the results corroborated the presence of a fused picobirnavirus genome. es are currently classified into genogroups I, II and III (GI, GII and GIII) based on RdRp sequences (B\u00e1nyai et al., 2014; Malik et al., 2014; Smits et al., 2014; Verma et al., 2015). we took RdRp proteins of PBV Equ1\u20134 together with all available picobirnavirus RdRp proteins 450 a partial parvovirus genome of 4922 bp with partial NS1 (513 aa), complete VP1 (1077 aa) and a 3\u2032 UTR (138 bp) was acquired by filling genomic gaps by PCR and amplifying 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 extremities using RACE. horse parvovirus CSF was classified as a tentative new species in the genus Copiparvovirus. ungulate copiparvovirus 3 was named ungulate copiparvovirus 3. protein sequence alignment of VP1 revealed horse parvovirus CSF possessed the Ca2+-binding loop (YXGXG) and the catalytic centre (HDXXY) of the putative secretory phospholipase A2 motifs. ORF2\u20134 encoded proteins of 134, 78 and 70 aa respectively. none of these theoretical proteins showed significant similarity with annotated proteins in GenBank. the CyCV Equ1 Rep showed 40\u201349 % amino acid identity to Rep proteins of circoviruses and cycloviruses. cyclovirus capsid showed no significant sequence identity with those of known circoviruses and cycloviruses. faeces of both healthy and diarrhoeic pigs were detected by inverse PCR. the complete 3800 nt circular genome was acquired by inverse PCR. it encoded a Rep protein of 305 aa plus four other major ORFs. the parenchyma between the portal and centrilobular areas is dark brown to red. the walls of the portal veins and hepatic arteries/arterioles are yellowish (icterus) bar, 500 m. (c) Liver histopathology, haematoxylin and eosin stain. several histiocytes/Kupffer cells contain intracytoplasmic haemosiderin granules. occasional bi-/tri-nucleated cells contain intracytoplasmic red blood cells. semicircular perivenous fibrosis is also shown (*). tosis and loss of >80 % of the hepatocytes in the centrilobular, midzonal and periportal areas. scattered erythrophagocytosis, multifocal moderate perivenous fibrosis in the centrilobular veins. pathological findings resemble those in the condition known as equine serum hepatitis. no. of reads, blastx, E value 1 10-5) HB1-12 Blood 6 Depression, loss of appetite, fever and nasal or ocular discharge 4 803 968 Anellovirus (718) HB2 Blood 6 1 061 712 None HB3 Blood 6 511 992 Picobirnavirus (380) hepacivirus sequences showed 91\u201396 % nucleotide identity to the hepacivirus found in equine serum and liver. the hepacivirus sequences showed 91\u201396 % nucleotide identity to the hepacivirus found in equine serum and liver. kb in length showed translated sequence similarities with the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene of picobirnavirus. a large contig of 4.2 kb was generated, which unexpectedly included both Segments 1 and 2. a high read coverage was distributed evenly across the 4.2 kb region, including at the expected junction of Segments 1 and 2. picobirnaviruses are currently classified into genogroups I, II and III (GI, GII and GIII) based on RdRp sequences (b\u00e1nyai et al., 2014; malik et al., 2014; Smits et al., 2015; Verma et al., 2015). the high degree of sequence divergence to currently characterized RdRp justified the classification of PBV Equ4 and PBV Equ1 and 3 as members of new genogroups GIV and GV respectively. un-rooted phylogenetic analysis of horse parvovirus CSF generated with the near-complete NS1 protein (500 aa) horse parvovirus CSF was classified as a tentative new species in the genus Copiparvovirus. the species currently comprises parvoviruses infecting pigs and cows. conservationed sequence motifs were identified, including two replication initiator motifs. the largest ORF, ORF1, of TTV Equ1 encodes a putative capsid protein of 635 aa, which as expected is arginine rich in its N terminus. a blastp search revealed that the amino acid sequence of ORF1 was closest to that of torque teno sus virus 1a from pig. s encoding the putative replication-associated (Rep, 271 aa) and capsid (Cap, 268 aa) proteins. the characteristic stem\u2013loop structure was found in the 5\u2032 intergenic region. the 3\u2032 intergenic region between the start codons of the two major ORFs was only 6 nt long, similar in length to those of other cycloviruses. liver and spleen tissues from horse with fatal idiopathic hepatopathy jaundice were pooled and analysed. the presence of this genome in both tissues was confirmed by PCR. the complete 3800 nt circular genome was acquired by inverse PCR. hepatic lobules have an irregular instead of hexagonal shape, a consequence of parenchymal collapse. hepatic lobules have an irregular instead of hexagonal shape, a consequence of parenchymal collapse. there is almost complete hepatocellular loss with very few remaining degenerate (arrowheads) and necrotic hepatocytes. centrilobular area is hypercellular due to infiltration of abundant histiocytes, fewer lymphocytes, and rare neutrophils. several histiocytes/Kupffer cells contain intracytoplasmic haemosiderin granules. diffuse icterus, a flabby liver with dark brown to red capsular and cut surfaces, and diffuse enhancement of the reticular pattern. microscopically, the most relevant histological lesions were present in the liver. the most relevant histological lesions were present in the liver. the second equine metagenomics study was published in 2013. it described a novel member of the genus Pegivirus (family Flaviviridae) in the serum of horses with non-fatal clinical hepatitis, as well as in the equine blood-derived botulinum antitoxin administered to these animals prior to the onset of their hepatitis. in order to further define the virome of horses with unexplained signs of disease the pathogenicity of picobirnavirus alone or as co-infections remains unclear. two studies reported picobirnaviruses in the respiratory tract of pigs and humans. pools HN3 and HF1 included the nasal swab and faecal samples. picobirnavirus RNA may have also been present in nasal secretions and faeces. no other eukaryotic viral sequences were detected in the same sample. anelloviruses are small, non-enveloped viruses with a negative-sense, circular ssDNA genome. the family Anelloviridae contains 11 genera, named from Alphatorquevirus to Lambdatorquevirus. a large number of diverse anelloviruses have been characterized in humans and other mammals. cyclovirus DNAs have been detected in the faeces, muscle tissue, blood, CSF and nasopharyngeal aspirates of human and other mammals. different cycloviruses (sharing 40 % amino acid identity in their capsid proteins with mammal-associated cycloviruses) have been identified in the abdomen of dragonflies and cockroaches. co-detection of sequence reads from insect viruses in pools of equine respiratory secretions indicated that viruses in the environment may also be inhaled onto these respiratory secretions. cycloviruses can replicate in mammalian tissues, including the respiratory tract, or are environmental contaminants remains to be determined. the cyclovirus genome was detected in presumably sterile sites (spleen and liver) there are presently no data to more firmly demonstrate its replication in mammalian cells. a causative role for any of these viruses in these horse diseases remains tentative. the horse was humanely euthanized in terminal stages of the disease due to poor prognosis. sections of all major organs were immersion-fixed in 10 % neutral buffered formalin for 24 h. fresh tissue samples and serum were collected for routine ancillary testing. the viral particle-containing filtrates were digested with a mixture of DNases and RNases to remove unprotected nucleic acids. they were then extracted using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen) or MagMAX Viral RNA Isolation kit (Ambion) and resuspended in 60 l water plus 40 U RNase inhibitor (Fermentas) ode Linux cluster was used to process the data. the reads were subtracted by mapping the reads to bacterial RefSeq genomes release 66 using bowtie2. Adaptors were trimmed using the default parameters of VecScreen. horse sample collection and veterinary testing All samples were stored at 80 \u00b0C until metagenomics analyses by this study. the plasma (n = 18), nasal swabs (n = 17) and faecal samples (n = 7) were collected from horses from California, Maryland and Pennsylvania, whose signs consisted of fever (>38.6 \u00b0C), depression, loss of appetite and ocular or nasal discharge. fresh tissue samples and serum were collected for routine ancillary testing to investigate infectious diseases. these included testing for west Nile virus, equid herpesvirus 1 and equine pegivirus by PCR, rabies virus by direct fluorescent antibody test on the brain and bacterial aerobic cultures from liver, lung and brain. samples included plasma, nasal swabs, faeces, CSF and tissues. NGS and data analysis Multiplexed viral DNA/RNA libraries were constructed using a Nextera XT DNA sample preparation kit (Illumina) the quality of the libraries was assessed using a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) and the quantification was estimated by a KAPA Library Quant kit (Kapa Biosystems) the presence of virus genome sequences assembled from NGS reads was confirmed by PCR and Sanger sequencing. multiple methods including nested PCR, inverse PCR, and 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 RACE were then used to obtain the genome of target viruses. putative ORFs with a coding capacity >100 aa were predicted by ORF finder."}
