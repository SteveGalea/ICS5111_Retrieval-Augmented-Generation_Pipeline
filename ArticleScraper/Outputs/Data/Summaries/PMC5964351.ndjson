{"summary": "current estimates indicate that 70% of all new emerging infectious diseases are of zoonotic origin (1, 2). historical examples of zoonotic pathogens include avian and swine influenza viruses, henipaviruses, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) a number of highly pathogenic viruses have been identified as reservoirs or potential reservoirs. the norovirus genus contains the most common and well-known caliciviruses. other caliciviruses have been identified in sea lions (22\u201324), minks (25), rabbits (26, 27), chickens (28), geese (29, 30), fish (31), and nonhuman primates. phylogenetic analyses have revealed that these viruses are closely related to sapoviruses (45, 46, 49) and \"valoviruses\" (46). the potential of these viruses to transmit into other mammals, including humans, is difficult to predict from genome-length sequences. RESULTS BtNoV is antigenically similar to noroviruses. we first sought to identify if BtNoV maintained any antigenic similarity with noroviruses. we produced BtNoV VLPs using alphavirus replicon vectors. data presented are the mean absorbance values (optical density at 450 nm [OD450]) measured following subtraction of negative-control absorbance values SEM for GI serum and GII.4 serum. Mean EC50 SEM (1/serum dilution) for reactivity of each antibody with each VLP. the GI HuNoV and GII.4.Sydney.2012 VLPs had almost identical EC50s for binding GI HuNoV-derived serums. we analyzed interactions between GI HuNoV and GII.4.Lordsdale.1997 HuNoV VLPs. data presented are mean OD450 absorbance values following subtraction of negative-control absorbance SEM. each interaction was evaluated in duplicate in two independent experiments. GII.4.Lordsdale.1997 VLPs bound significantly better to H type 1 HBGAs. we identified multiple viral sequences from Coronaviridae, Herpesviridae, Iflaviridae insect viruses, Tymoviridae plant viruses, and Podoviridae bacteriophage. we assembled two contigs of 865 nucleotides and 534 nucleotides from 232 and 3 sequence reads from the guano of Perimyotis subflavus, the tri-colored bat. a maximum-likelihood cladogram (B) and radial phylograms (C) of 51 known calicivirus S domain amino acid sequences were generated based on the JTT matrix-based amino acid substitution model (SB) we analyzed the amino acid sequences of the conserved shell (S) domain of the capsid protein. phylogenetic results suggest that BtCalV/A10 most likely represents a genus and species distinct from all of the previously identified caliciviruses. a maximum-likelihood cladogram (A) and radial phylograms (B) of 50 known VP1 capsid amino acid sequences were generated based on the JTT matrix-based amino acid substitution model (SA) the data are presented as percent consensus amino acid and sequence identity. download TABLE S1, DOCX file, 0.01 MB (15.9KB, docx) Copyright 2018 Kocher et al. data presented are mean absorbance values (OD450) following subtraction of negative-control values SEM. each VLP-HBGA interaction was measured in duplicate in two independent experiments. caliciviruses bind HBGAs, sialic acids, and other host ligands. the unrecognized structures in P1 and -helices in P2 suggested that BtCalV/A10 contained novel structures dissimilar from the structures in other caliciviruses. modeling of full-length VP1 capsid sequence from HuNoV, MNV, GI.1 human sapovirus, BtNoV, and BtCalV/A10 using the PHYRE2 protein recognition server. the homologous models for both BtCalV/A10 and BtNoV resembled the MNV P domain backbone. however, as expected, the homologous models resembled the MNV P domain backbone. we also modeled the BtCalV/A10 and BtNoV P dimers on the backbone of two GII.4 HuNoVs (Fig. 4E to G) GI.1.Norwalk.1968 VLPs primarily bound H type 3 and A antigens but weakly bound the H type 1 and B antigens and -2,6-sialic acid. GII.4.Lordsdale.1997 VLPs strongly bound H type 3, A, and B and -2,6-sialic acid with limited binding to H type 1 and -2,6-sialic acid. lic acid has moderate binding to H type 1 and H type 3, A, and B HBGAs. caliciviruses can bind to host receptors and offer multiple routes for cross-species transmission. BtNoV is antigenically similar to noroviruses, specifically HuNoVs. GI.1.Norwalk.1968, GII.4.Lordsdale.1997, GII.4.Sydney.2012. GI and GII.4 HuNoV-derived serums strongly reacted with their homotypic VLPs. GI (EC50 of 1/340.4) and GII.4 (EC50 of 1/694.4) serums had almost identical EC50s for binding GI HuNoV-derived serums. BtNoV binds histo-blood group antigens similarly to a historic HuNoV. data presented are mean OD450 absorbance values following subtraction of negative-control absorbance SEM. each VLP-HBGA interaction was evaluated in duplicate in two independent experiments. dsdale.1997 VLPs bound to HBGAs and their carbohydrate binding interactions were impacted by temperature. the A10 bat calicivirus is phylogenetically related to \"recoviruses\" we hypothesize that other caliciviruses are circulating in bats. we identified multiple viral sequences from Coronaviridae, Herpesviridae, Iflaviridae insect viruses, Tymoviridae plant viruses, and Podoviridae bacteriophage. the sampling site of Little Orleans, MD, is marked by a star. the map was generated using data from the International Union for Conservation of Nature. a maximum-likelihood cladogram (B) and radial phylograms (C) of 51 known calicivirus S domain sequences were generated. BtCalV/A10 clustered most closely with RHDV and next most closely with the \"recoviruses\" a maximum-likelihood cladogram (A) and radial phylograms (B) of 50 known calicivirus VP1 capsid amino acid sequences were generated based on the JTT matrix-based amino acid substitution model. the data are presented as percent consensus amino acid and sequence identity. the data are presented as percent consensus amino acid and sequence identity. previous works have solved the capsid and P domain structures of several caliciviruses. binding patterns of BtCalV/A10 and BtNoV were screened in comparison with those of HuNoVs. the data presented are mean absorbance values (OD450) following subtraction of negative-control values SEM. each VLP-HBGA interaction was measured in duplicate in two independent experiments. the presence of -sheets in the S domain suggested that the BtCalV/A10 capsid sequence resembled a calicivirus capsid sequence. the unrecognized structures in P1 and -helices in P2 suggested that BtCalV/A10 contained novel structures dissimilar from the structures in other caliciviruses. the homologous models for both BtCalV/A10 and BtNoV resembled the MNV P domain backbone. however, as expected, the homologous models resembled the MNV P domain template. we also modeled the BtCalV/A10 and BtNoV P dimers on the backbone of two GII.4 HuNoVs (Fig. 4E to G) GI.1.Norwalk.1968 VLPs primarily bound H type 3 and A antigens but weakly bound the H type 1 and B antigens and -2,6-sialic acid. GII.4.Lordsdale.1997 VLPs strongly bound H type 3 and A HBGA carbohydrates but bound weakly to H type 1 and -2,6-sialic acid. caliciviruses are important reservoir hosts for newly emerging viruses. the existence of distinct genera and genogroups, coupled with multiple variable genotypes, suggests that multiple novel independent introductions from animal populations may have contributed to the genetic diversity of noroviruses and caliciviruses. both bat viruses retain ligand binding sites similar to those seen with HuNoVs. similarities in attachment and entry cofactors suggest that these bat viruses have the potential to overcome a major roadblock to cross-species transmission across a variety of mammalian species. a similar approach has identified the potential for MERS and SARS-like coronaviruses within Asian and African bat populations to replicate and emerge in human populations. we also identified bat coronaviruses that emerged more recently and caused outbreaks in swine (8, 9, 69, 70) noroviruses have been historically classified on the basis of capsid sequence homology. based on this strategy, BtNoV would likely be classified within norovirus GV alongside MNV. other bat noroviruses have shown extensive homology with GIV noroviruses. NVs bind sialic acids and CD300lf (78\u201380), porcine sapoviruses bind sialic acids (81), and both feline calicivirus and the zoonotic San Miguel sea lion virus Hom-1 bind junctional adhesion molecule-1 (82, 83). HBGAs have been identified or predicted across numerous animal species. the study did not support the conclusion that bat caliciviruses will emerge in human or other mammalian populations. the results suggest that more bat caliciviruses should be identified and sequenced, primarily in China. maximum-likelihood cladograms of 50 known calicivirus VP1 amino acid sequences and 51 known calicivirus S domain amino acid sequences were generated using MEGA7. cladograms were generated based on the JTT matrix-based amino acid substitution model and initially derived with the Neighbor-Join and BioNJ algorithms. amino acid sequences were aligned using the Clustal Omega platform. predicted tertiary structure of the aligned sequence was determined by the use of the Modeller platform. a carbohydrate binding assay was conducted to detect VLP binding. the plates were incubated at 25\u00b0C, 32\u00b0C, and 37\u00b0C for 1 h. the plates were washed 3 times with PBS\u20130.05% Tween. data are presented as mean absorbance values standard errors of the means (SEM) at 450 nm after removal of negative-control absorbance values. an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) was conducted as previously described (53, 95) cladograms of 50 known calicivirus VP1 amino acid sequences and 51 known calicivirus S domain amino acid sequences were generated using MEGA7. maximum-likelihood cladograms of 50 known calicivirus VP1 amino acid sequences were generated using MEGA7. the full-length BtCalV/A10, GII.4.1997.Lordsdale HuNoV, GI.1 human sapovirus, GV.1 MNV, and BtNoV capsid sequences (50) were submitted to the Protein Homology/analogy Recognition Engine V2.0 (PHYRE2) server (88) and analyzed using Intensive Mode. the predicted tertiary structure of the aligned sequence was determined by the use BtNoV mRNAs were electroporated in C6/36 mosquito larva (Aedes albopictus) cells (ATCC) and BHK cells. VLPs were purified by velocity sedimentation in sucrose. Streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was diluted in blotto (1:10,000) and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. plates were washed 3 times with PBS\u20130.05% Tween between steps. each HBGA-VLP interaction was evaluated in duplicate. anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were diluted in blotto, added to each plate, and incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. negative controls included wells with no VLP and no primary antibody."}
