{"summary": "epithelial cells are positioned strategically to provide barriers to pathogens and other environmental agents. they are located both on the outside, e.g., in the skin surface, and on the inside, e.g., along the gastrointestinal tract. these barriers display both physical and immune characteristics. water fluxes through aquaporins (AQP) play a pivotal role in cell migration. by such interplay with the cytoskeleton and signaling cascades, the AQP do assist directly and indirectly distinct processes. epithelial barrier functions at the front line of viral infections. CCHFV is a human high-fatality rate pathogen causing fever, hemorrhagic symptoms and gastro-intestinal disorders. it is an enveloped virus, with three negative-stranded RNA, designated as small, medium and large. it encodes the nucleocapsid protein (N), surface glycoproteins, and a RNA-dependent polymerase. hazara virus is classified as a hazard group 2 pathogen. it is not associated with serious diseases in humans. CCHFV exhibit about 70 and 86% nucleotide and amino acid sequence similarity. aquaporin 6 (AQP6) appears to have a protective role against Hazara virus infections. the aim of this study was to assess in greater detail consequences of virus-host cell interactions, focusing on whether and how the virus infection impacts wound-healing, cytoskeleton organization, IQGAP1 and AQP6 characteristics. we found that the virus load and infection duration strongly impacted epithelial cell structure, signaling and the repair potential. SW-13 cells were supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 25 mM HEPES, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 g/ml streptomycin. cells were starved in serum-free DMEM overnight and then infected with Hazara virus at 3 multiplicities of infection (MOI) 0.02, 1 and 2 for 1 h at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 in DMEM supplemented with 100 U/ at 0, 24 and 48 hpi, the insert was removed to get two cell patches with a 500 50 m cell-free gap in between allowing the cells to migrate and heal the wound. for each dish, the images of cells migrating into the gap area were taken at indicated time points using the benchtop microscope. cells were fixed, permeabilized, labeled with polyclonal rabbit anti-CCHFV/Hazara N antibodies. fluorescent foci were counted in an Axiovert 35 fluorescence microscope. this allowed the determination of the infectious virus titer in focus forming units per ml (FFU/ml) IQGAP1 or polyclonal rabbit antibodies against AQP6 (05-504, AB3073, Millipore, Temecula, CA) diluted 1:200 in blocking buffer were then applied for 1 h at 37\u00b0C in a moist dark chamber. to detect F-actin, cells were stained with Alexa 488-conjugated phalloidin (A12379, Life Technologies) ed with 25U nuclease (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL), 1 mM phenyl-methyl-sulfonyl-fluoride, 1 mM Na3VaO4, 25 mM NaF (Sigma Aldrich), protein inhibitors Complete (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) cell suspensions were homogenized through a 21-gauge needle and centrifuged at 18,000 g for 30 min at at least 4 independent experiments were performed on separate days on different cell passages. immunoprecipitation Total-cell lysates were pre-cleared for 30 min at 4\u00b0C with of protein G-Sepharose \u201c4 fast flow\u201d. samples with equal protein concentrations were then precipitated overnight at 4\u00b0C. mm 100 m C18 pre column followed by a 100 mm 75 m C18 column with particle size 5 m (NanoSeparatoons, Nieuwkoop, Netherlands) at a flow rate 300 nL/min. automated online analyses were performed with a LTQ Orbitrap Velos Pro hybrid mass spectrometer. the label-free quantitative analysis of peptides was performed by spectral counting analysis using normalized spectral abundance factor (NSAF) calculated for each protein to normalize run-to-run variations. differences with P 0.1 were considered statistically significant. identified proteins were categorized according to gene ontology terms. DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 g/ml streptomycin, 1% non-essential amino acids and 2 mM L-glutamine (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. this was done for 7\u201310 days to allow the cells to become mature, differentiated and establish polarized epithelial monolayers. cells were serum-starved overnight and either non-infected or infected with Hazara virus at different MOI for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. after 1-h infection, cells were rinsed and maintained for 0, 24, or 48 hpi. the images of cells migrating into the gap area of the wound were taken using a benchtop microscope. the images of cells migrating into the gap area of the wound were taken at indicated time using the benchtop microscope. the pre-treatment with 0.2% Triton X-100 was important for a clear labeling of proteins. cells were further permeabilized in 0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. non-specific background staining was blocked for 10 min in PBS containing 1% BSA and 10 mM glycine. at least 3 independent experiments were done on separate days on different cell passages. total cell lysates, SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting monolayers grown on 6-well plates or flasks were washed with PBS, pH 7.6 and lysed with ice-cold RIPA buffer. the membranes were then incubated with antibodies against CCHFV/Hazara N. they were then incubated with antibodies against IQGAP1, AQP6, and GAPDH. the signals were detected and the density ratio was quantified using the Odyssey CLx and the Image Studio software. the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue (Thermo Scientific) at least 4 independent experiments were done on separate days on different cell passages. protein identification by in-gel digestion and LC-MS/MS Coomassie Blue-stained protein bands were excised, reduced, alkylated and digested. label-free quantitative analysis of peptides was performed by spectral counting analysis using normalized spectral abundance factor (NSAF) calculated for each protein to normalize run-to-run variations. differences with P 0.1 were considered statistically significant. experiments for immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, proteome and interactome were repeated 4 times on separate days. results Hazara virus modulates migration and wound-healing capacity of epithelial cell monolayers. cell monolayers were either untreated (Control) or infected with Hazara virus at MOI 2.0 and 0.02 for 1 h. after 1-h infection, cells were rinsed and maintained for 0, 24, or 48 hpi. to create a wound, the inserts were removed at 0, 24, or 48 hpi. confocal imaging revealed dramatic decreases in F-actin and redistribution of IQGAP1 and AQP6 in Caco-2 monolayers infected with Hazara virus. the distribution of these proteins in juxta-membrane regions went from a distinct uniform to a more disorganized and diffuse pattern. the quantification of fluorescence intensities of F-actin, IQGAP1 and AQP6 in juxta- the infection with Hazara virus at MOI 1 for 24 h caused a significant decrease in the expression level of either protein. untreated non-infected Caco-2 cell monolayers were used as a control. samples were then fixed and stained for: (A) viral N (red) and F-actin (green); (B) viral N (red) and IQGAP1 (green); (C) viral N (green) and AQP6 (red); nuclei were immunoblots for IQGAP1, AQP6, viral N, and GAPDH. blots are from one representative out of four independent experiments. blots are from one representative out of four independent experiments. total cell lysate samples were separated on SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie blue. for the latter, no significant difference in protein patterns was observed. cells were immunoprecipitated using antibodies against CCHFV/Hazara (viral N) Identified proteins Gene (Uniprot accession number) Protein (Uniprot accession number) Protein (Uniprot accession number) MW kDa P-value Fold change, (infected/control) Functional groups of human proteins # PROTEINS DETECTED IN N-ENRICHED IMMUNE COMPLEXES ONLY in virus-infected cells.

IQGAP1 regulates egress of Ebola virus (Lu et al., 2013), invasion and replication of Moloney leukemia virus (Leung et al., 2006) and virulence of swine fever virus (Gladue et al., 2011). CCHFV did perturb strongly the microtubule and actin filaments during entry, growth and release to the surroundings. of around 500 cellular proteins were typically identified in N-enriched immune complexes. 10 proteins were detected only in virus-infected cells. further 13 and 12 proteins displayed either increased or decreased binding to N-enriched immune complexes. a large group of proteins is required for regulation of cell morphology, migration, differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. virus can target and manipulate host cytoskeleton dynamics and organization which may ensure virus replication and spread. pathogenic bacteria and viruses can hijack host EMV and thereby enhance their pathogenicity. ribonucleoproteins in mature virions are seen in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (Huang et al., 2004), infectious bronchitis virus (Spencer and Hiscox, 2006), and CCHFV (Morikawa et al., 2007). Viral N interferes with immune system to enhance virus virulence, arrest host cell cycle and inactivate chaperons.
