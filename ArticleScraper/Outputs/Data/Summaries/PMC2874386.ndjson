{"summary": "a confirmed case of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 was defined as an ILI in a patient with a temperature >37.5\u00b0C, cough, rhinorrhea, sore throat, or myalgia. a confirmed case of pandemic was defined as an ILI in a patient with a temperature >37.5\u00b0C, cough, rhinorrhea, sore throat, or myalgia. 152 people with confirmed pandemic (H1N1) 2009 were admitted to TTSH. 116 cases span 5 weeks (epidemiologic weeks 21\u201325) from when the first confirmed case-patient arrived in Singapore on may 26, 2009. TTSH screening center airport doctor 15 (12.9) Self-referred 51 (44.0) Screening criteria documented during clinical examination Temperature >37.5\u00b0C 84 (72.4) Temperature >37.8\u00b0C 71 (61.2) temperature >38.0\u00b0C 61 (52.6) WHO ILI criteria 51 (44.0) Arrival at TTSH, by epidemiologic week 21 5 (4.3) 22 8 (6.9) 23 13 (11.2) 24 41 (35.3) 25 49 (42.2) the first cases of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 detected among travelers arriving from the Philippines (week 22), Thailand (week 23), and Indonesia (week 25) indicated potential community transmission in those countries earlier than official announcements. infections from Southeast Asian countries accounted for 29% of imported cases during the containment phase. time of symptom onset was closer to the time of arrival in Singapore for those arriving from longer distances (p = 0.001) patients with longer travel durations were also more likely to have onset of symptoms before arrival (p = 0.04) predictors of time to isolation for 116 patients with travel-associated pandemic (H1N1) 2009, Singapore, April 26\u2013June 27, 2009*. predictors of time to isolation for 116 patients with travel-associated pandemic (H1N1) 2009. p value by t test for dichotomous variables and 1-way analysis of variance for multichotomous variables. temperature >37.8\u00b0C plus cough or sore throat. temperature >38.0\u00b0C plus cough or sore throat. thermal scanners detected 40% of cases-patients from all flights. symptoms would develop in most passengers who become ill after entry. exit screening will depend on the role of asymptomatic persons in transmission. if the converse were true, transmission occurring in nearby countries. clinical features were assessed at a single time point and there was potential recall bias. affected areas shifted from the Americas to Australasia to Asia within a matter of days. the monitoring of travelers fulfills a vital sentinel surveillance function."}
