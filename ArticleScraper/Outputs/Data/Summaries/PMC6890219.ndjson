{"summary": "public health agencies often implement a variety of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions to prevent epidemic expansion, including vaccination and medical prophylaxis, school closures and other social distancing measures. however, such measures require population adherence and are often hindered by failure to take recommended actions. in the united states, 2015-2016 uptake was only 59.3% in children and 41.7% in adults [7] in some cases, oversimplified or erroneous media reports regarding flawed vaccines can trigger panic and increases in vaccine hesitancy. vaccination protects not only the immunized individual, but also social contacts who might have been infected by the individual. social distancing decisions may break chains of transmission by protecting the decision-maker. we compare the efficacy of these three different paradigms across a range of diseases in a realistically heterogeneous network. the most naive model\u2013simply counting one\u2019s infected contacts\u2013affords the most epidemiological protection using the least amount of resources (e.g., vaccinations or economic costs associated with social distancing) b\u00e1si-Albert scale-free network has degree distributions constrained to achieve the same epidemic threshold as the focal exponential network. all three networks share T c = k k 2 - k = 0. 056 where k and k2 are the average degree and squared degree in the network. individuals decide to vaccinate based on one of three risk measures. the number of infected contacts (local count), the fraction of infected contacts (local prevalence) or the overall fraction infected (global prevalence) the global prevalence model assumes that individuals base vaccination decisions on the epidemiological state of the entire population. the mean degree (k) appears in the global prevalence and local prevalence as a normalizer. if node i has the average degree (ki = k) and its local prevalence mirrors global prevalence ( i ( t ) k = I ( t ) N. all infected contacts were just infected and at the beginning of their infectious period. but overestimates risk if some are nearing recovery. we estimate these expected values by averaging over 500 simulations. infected individuals transmit disease to each susceptible contact at a rate. infected individuals remain infectious for 7 days before recovering with full immunity to future infection. individuals decide to vaccinate based on one of three risk measures. the number of infected contacts (local count), the fraction of infected contacts (local prevalence), or the overall fraction infected (global prevalence) individuals assess infection risk by tracking the fraction of their social contacts that are currently infected. k i k (2) where i(t) is the number of neighbors of i that are infected at time t, ki is the total number of neighbors (degree) of i, and k is the average degree of the network. in the second model, local count, individuals track their number rather than proportion of infected neighbors, and decide to vaccinate according to v lc. vlc is the probability that any currently infected contact will transmit disease to the focal node at some point during his or her infections period. this exactly estimates risk if all infected contacts were just infected and at the beginning of their infectious period. this exactly estimates risk if all infected contacts were just infected and at the beginning of their infectious period. the mean degree (k) appears in the global prevalence and local prevalence as a normalizer. if node i has the average degree (ki = k) and its local prevalence mirrors global prevalence ( i ( t ) k = I ( t ) N, then it will have the same probability of vaccinating across all three models. the expected total number of individuals vaccinated under the global prevalence strategy is averaging over 500 simulations with the specified R0 and decision model. the local strategies avert more infections with fewer vaccinations than the global strategy. the local count strategy is more protective than the local prevalence strategy. individuals more accurately assess the local force of infection by tracking the number rather than proportion of infected contacts. if they both have two infected contacts, their risk of infection will be similar. all values are averages across 500 stochastic simulations. the global prevalence strategy leads to near universal vaccination, consistently more than double the coverage produced by the local count strategy. the population-level protection afforded by the local count strategy exhibits a non-trivial trend with R0. in a sensitivity analysis, we find that these qualitative results are robust to our assumptions about the efficacy of the vaccine. for each degree class, we graph the proportion of individuals that vaccinate (top) along with the epidemiological situation at the time a node chooses to vaccinate. the local count strategy (light blue) is the only strategy for which the probability of vaccinating consistently increases with degree. the local count strategy robustly affords the most efficient population-level protection, averting the maximum number of infections. we compare three different network structures\u2013homogeneous (top), exponential (middle), and scale-free (bottom) and show the susceptible (black), infected (dark gray) and vaccinated (light gray) for two different values of R0. two out of three infected contacts carries the same immediate risk as two out of ten. the advantage of local risk assessment stems from two sources of variation in risk. the more similar the two networks, the greater the individual and population-level protection achieved by vaccination. the best paradigm for averting infections also requires the fewest resources. for every individual that takes action, almost two infections are averted under the local strategy. for every individual that takes action, almost two infections are averted under the local strategy. the model assumes that individuals are short-sighted and make reactive decisions to avert immediate threat. the results of our analysis are robust for a large class of \u2018on-the-fly\u2019 interventions that afford relatively rapid protection in the heat of an epidemic. we highlight our assumption that all edges (contacts) in our networks are equally likely to transmit disease. models can elucidate vaccine campaign failures and identify key pressure points for increasing uptake. we do not suggest public health agencies should promote \u2018infection-counting\u2019. we conclude that data-driven models can be instrumental in designing effective outbreak information campaigns. x-axes indicate the delay between an individual deciding to vaccinate and becoming immune to infection. each simulation assumes an exponential network with N = 10000 individuals. 80% of vaccinated individuals become protected against infection."}
