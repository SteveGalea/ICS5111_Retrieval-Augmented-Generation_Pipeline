{"summary": "the rapid and accurate diagnosis of respiratory viral pathogens has the potential to reduce complications, antibiotic use, and unnecessary laboratory testing (4\u20136) clinical laboratories traditionally use methods such as direct fluorescent-antibody assay (DFA) and viral culture to detect respiratory viruses. multiple catchers with unique melting-temperature profiles can be detected by catcher melting-temperature analysis (CMTA) multiple target analytes can be detected simultaneously in a single fluorescence channel. in this study, we evaluated the diagnostic performance of RV16 compared to those of xTAG and RV15. a total of 482 specimens were tested by RV15, RV16, and xTAG. the patients included 287 males and 195 females whose median age was 51 years. CMTA was performed by cooling the reaction mixture to 55\u00b0C, maintaining the mixture at 55\u00b0C for 30 s, and heating the mixture from 55\u00b0C to 85\u00b0C. the melting peaks were derived from the initial fluorescence (F) versus temperature (T) curves by plotting the negative derivative of fluorescence over temperature versus temperature (dF/dT versus T) the xTAG assay required two PCRs for multiplex amplification PCR. the cDNA and amplification steps were performed in a single-tube format. the xTAG assay required a separate cDNA synthesis step. the samples were tested for 13 types of RNA viruses and two types of DNA viruses with respiratory virus detection kits. PCR was conducted in a final volume of 20 l containing 3 l of cDNA, 4 l of 5 RV15 ACE primer (A, B, or C), 3 l of 8-MOP solution, and 10 l of 2 master mix using the thermocycler. a total of 482 specimens were tested by RV15, RV16, and xTAG. the patients included 287 males and 195 females whose median age was 51 years. cleic acids were extracted from 500 l of specimens by easyMAG (bioM\u00e9rieux, France) for RV15 and by STARlet (Hamilton Robotics, NV) for RV16 and xTAG. an internal control was added to each specimen so as to check the entire process from nucleic acid extraction to PCR, according to the manufacturer's instructions. the melting-temperature analysis was done by Seegene viewer software, which interpreted the results as \u201c+\u201d or \u201c.\u201d the user also could check the \u201cdF/dT versus T curve\u201d on this program. cDNA and amplification steps were performed in a single-tube format. xTAG assay required two PCRs for multiplex target-specific primer extension PCR. cDNA synthesis was performed with a cDNA synthesis kit. ACE primer (A, B, or C), 3 l of 8-MOP solution and 10 l of 2 master mix were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Specimens with discordant results were tested by monoplex PCR and sequencing. the primers for monoplex PCR were identical with the primers of the RV15 or RV16 assay. 102 (38.0%) gave true-positive results. a single virus was detected in 228 specimens, two viruses in 62 specimens, three in 7 specimens, four in 2 specimens, and five in 1 specimen. RV16 demonstrated higher sensitivity in the detection of ADV (100% [39/39] versus 79.5% [31/39]; P 0.01) but was less sensitive than xTAG for RhV and EV (89.4% [84/94] versus 97.9% [92/94]; P 0.05) viruses in 83.6% (56/67), 73.1% (49/67), and 70.1% (47/67) of the samples containing multiple viruses. xTAG has combined RhV and EV targets, these viruses were lumped together as RhV/EV to perform a sensitivity and specificity analysis. of the 199 retrospectively collected specimens, 198 gave true-positive results. 102 (38.0%) gave true-positive results. a single virus was detected in 228 specimens, two viruses in 62 specimens, three in 7 specimens, four in 2 specimens and five in 1 specimen. RV16 was more sensitive than xTAG for CoV OC43/HKU1 (100% [23/23] versus 26.1% [6/23]; P 0.0001) and ADV (100% [39/39] versus 79.5% [31/39]; P 0.01) but less sensitive than did RV15. specificities of the three methods were generally very high. multiple viruses were detected in 67 specimens (22.6% of positive specimens, excluding BoV results) RV16, RV15, and xTAG detected all of the contained viruses in 83.6% (56/67), 73.1% (49/67), and 70.1% (47/67) of the samples containing multiple viruses. the sequencing analysis identified RhV as RhV A (n = 34), RhV B (n = 4), or RhV C (n = 24). RV16 missed four cases of RhV C and one case of RhV C. xTAG missed one case of RhV A. sensitivity of RV15 and RV16 assays for RhV should be improved. otherwise, the advantage of differentiating RhV and EV would diminish with lower sensitivity. xTAG was the most time- and labor-intensive, requiring 8 to 9 h. xTAG and RV15 detected 100% and 90% of ADV in specimens harboring ADV as a single agent. but only 71.4% and 79.6% of ADV in specimens harboring multiple agents. impact of multiple viruses on severity of clinical illness is still unclear."}
