{"summary": "emergence of influenza H1N1v prompted development of pandemic preparedness plans. national systems of public health law are essential for public health stewardship. but little research has been undertaken on how law works as a tool for disease control in Europe. there is insufficient understanding of the role and importance of law in pandemic planning. states need to build capacity in public health law to support disease prevention and control policies. emergence of avian influenza H5N1 galvanized political and public health communities. the review was limited to documents in French and English that were available in the public domain between 2003 and 2007. 114 open-ended and closed-ended questions were framed around an emergent influenza pandemic scenario. the questionnaire addressed the temporal phases and public health interventions identified through the scoping exercise. participants were identified through contact with ministries of health, academic institutions, professional networks, announcements at conferences, and searching journals. participants were identified through contact with ministries of health, academic institutions, professional networks, and search journals to identify authors with relevant expertise. approach to analysis consisted of five interconnected stages: familiarisation; identification of a thematic framework; indexing; charting and mapping; and interpretation. Ethics approval Not required. participants states The research focus was all European Union countries and the neighbouring countries of Croatia, Turkey, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. respondents from each country with legal and public health expertise were identified through WHO, ministries of public health, screening of pertinent publications. questionnaires were sent by email with follow up reminders to ensure a high response rate. participants were identified through contact with ministries of health, academic institutions, professional networks, announcements at conferences, and searching journals. self-administered questionnaire was developed, piloted and finalised. questionnaire addressed temporal phases and public health interventions. questionnaires were framed around emergent influenza pandemic scenario. respondents analysed how differences between national legal systems and between specific laws might support or hinder regional responses to pandemic influenza. participants were identified through contact with ministries of health, academic institutions, professional networks, announcements at conferences, and searching journals to identify authors with relevant expertise. participants from 23 states have laws addressing the prevention and control of communicable diseases. in nine states there are also emergency powers provided in legislation that include a pandemic in the definition of an emergency. 23 states report duties specific to human influenza 15 Compulsory screening 13 Compulsory isolation 17* Compulsory quarantine 12* Compulsory vaccination 9 Compulsory treatment 17 Provision of healthcare to an EU national resident in their state 18 Provision of healthcare to a visitor from outside Europe 16 Authorise unlicensed staff to be requisitioned to perform medical acts in a pandemic 7 Requisition of persons 16 Authorise unlicensed staff to be the national pandemic plans of the five federal or quasi federal states where plans were available in English were analyzed. the national pandemic plans of the five federal or quasi federal states where plans were available in English were analyzed, examining the distribution of pandemic planning roles and responsibilities. preliminary analysis of coherence between laws and plans. in only two of these states were all the measures proposed in plans supported by specific legal authorisation. in other states, such as Ireland, there is a broad power to make regulations to prevent the spread of infectious disease. new laws in france allow the minister of health to take any measures proportionate to protect the public health. new laws in france allow the minister of health to take any measures proportionate to protect the public health. new laws in france allow the minister of health to take any measures that are proportionate to protect the public health. in some states it was considered that legislation was more developed than the preparedness plan, and in others that the plan was well defined. there are also differences in the extent to which emergency powers can be drawn upon in a pandemic. in the Netherlands there is emergency powers legislation applicable to a pandemic, in exceptional circumstances and on a decision of the cabinet. there are laws in some states to authorise restrictions on movement of goods. some states have incorporated the EU legislation on data protection[14]. some states have passed laws to authorise the provision of public health data to public health authorities. interventions proposed in some plans lack legal underpinning. 'there is confusion about who is competent'; 'there is a gap in planning in relation to coordination' one workshop participant commented, 'there is a definite need for public health law training for medical personnel and there are not enough courses available' 'there is little training in public health law, as this issue is not well addressed within Europe' 'it would be good to have uniform guidelines to avoid medical tourism, for example' one participant noted, 'there are economic considerations. Individual states are reluctant to be the first to take measures such as contact tracing, for economic reasons' the Schengen Treaties (1985) on free traffic of persons are applicable in 26 countries, including the non-EU countries Norway, Iceland and Switzerland, but excluding the UK, Ireland, Bulgaria, Cyprus and Romania. ten states have laws that would authorise border closure in a pandemic. the pandemic planning roles and responsibilities between national and regional governments were analyzed. the national pandemic plans of the five federal or quasi federal states where plans were available in English were analyzed, examining the distribution of pandemic planning roles and responsibilities. national government Sweden 21 provinces 290 municipalities Planning and co-ordination Situation monitoring Assessment Communication Reducing the spread of diseases Guidance for health systems Management of health system Provision of a knowledge base Planning and co-ordination Reducing the spread of diseases Contingency plans Provision of health care and medical services Distribution of vaccine and antiviral drugs Mixed - response between national and regional United Kingdom* 4 regions. some states have laws that are detailed and prescriptive. new laws in france allow the minister of health to take any measures proportionate to protect the public health. the european convention on human rights (ECHR) is considered to limit measures that can be taken under public health legislation. in all states there are differing approaches to the status of pandemic preparedness plans. the intention to use emergency powers is significant in that emergency powers may allow for greater intervention, with possible derogation from the European Convention on human rights[13]. thematic coherence Discussion in the workshops was facilitated in accordance with the predetermined themes. there are differences in accessibility to healthcare resources across european states. some states, such as Malta, intend to continue to allocate healthcare on clinical grounds. some states may use emergency powers to control movements of goods and people so as to prioritise state citizens. the lack of public health law expertise was even more significant in states where public health powers were not detailed in legislation. 'there is a need for education, training and research on the role of law in public health in Europe,' one workshop participant commented. a person can only be detained for the purposes of treatment, with a focus on individual benefit rather than public health. in other states, such as England and Wales, a person can be detained but cannot be compulsorily treated. differences in access to healthcare and in the obligation of healthcare workers to work in a pandemic. a. movement of people, goods and information There is no common approach across the states represented as to the control of movement of people. some states, such as Sweden and Ireland, envisage no restrictions. states such as Cyprus that are not signatories to the Schengen Agreement have the option to close borders against travellers from within Europe. some states, such as Malta, intend to continue to allocate healthcare on clinical grounds. some states may use emergency powers to control movements of goods and people so as to prioritise state citizens in the allocation of health benefits. the lack of public health law expertise was even more significant in states where public health powers were not detailed in legislation. one workshop participant commented, 'there is a definite need for public health law training for medical personnel and there are not enough courses available' a person can be detained but cannot be compulsorily treated. there were differences in access to healthcare and in the obligation of healthcare workers to work in a pandemic. participants suggested a need for greater guidance in the management of a disease pandemic. the results of this study show differences in the extent to which national pandemic policy and pandemic plans have been integrated with public health laws. there are differences in the legal status of pandemic plans; in some states plans have for all practical purposes the status of law. only in two states were lines of command thought to be clear, coordinated and detailed. lack of public health legal expertise compounds inaccessibility. lack of understanding of laws by persons working in public health has contributed to lack of coherence between the IHR, plans and laws in some states. the first two workshops considered plans and laws on this basis. participants were concerned about the feasibility of legal reporting obligations where disease was so widespread, and possible conflict between national laws on disease reporting and WHO advice. the project, scenario and questionnaire was designed with H5N1 influenza in mind. participants were concerned about the feasibility of legal reporting obligations where disease was so widespread, and possible conflict between national laws on disease reporting and WHO advice. there are significant differences in legislation and in the legitimacy of conduct across states in Europe. in some states pandemic plans are part of the law and in others not. in some states pandemic plans are part of the law and in others not. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors' contributions RM, RC, AL and AC contributed to the writing and review of this paper."}
