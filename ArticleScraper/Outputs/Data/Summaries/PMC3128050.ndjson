{"summary": "Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis are the primary bacterial pathogens of otitis media. antecedent respiratory viral infection increases bacterial density and progression to perforation. early dense colonization predicts early onset of otitis media. progression to tympanic membrane perforation occurs in 30% of children by 6 months of age and 40% by 18 months of age. overcrowding, poor hygiene, limited formal education and inadequate access to under-resourced medical services contribute to prevalence and severity of OM in remote indigenous populations. human rhinovirus (HRV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus A and B (FLUA, FLUB), HAdV, HCoV and parainfluenza virus 1, 2 and 3 (PIV 1, PIV2 & PIV3) are commonly associated with OM. recent advances in molecular viral diagnostics now allow a broader insight into viral OM pathogenesis. in the tropical north of Australia, AOM is endemic in remote communities and not subject to seasonal viral outbreaks. in this study we use molecular methods to investigate whether antecedent nasopharyngeal viral infection increases bacterial load and progression to AOMwiP. analysis of bacterial and viral pathogens was performed as part of a larger case-control/crossover study. PCR target genes were: 16S rRNA for total bacterial load [28], autolysin (lytA) for S. pneumoniae load [29], protein D (hpd) for H. influenzae load [3], and the outer membrane protein (copB) for M. catarrhalis load [30]. rank test and Mann Whitney Wilcoxon ranksum tests were used to compare bacterial loads between ear states, with or without viral co-detection. all statistical analysis was performed using STATA IC version 11 (StataCorp, Texas, USA) middle ear discharge present for longer than 6 weeks and perforation covering greater than 2% of the pars tensa of the TM. analysis of bacterial and viral pathogens was performed as part of a larger case-control/crossover study. non-parametric tests for continuous variables, Kruskal-Wallis equality of populations rank test and Mann Whitney Wilcoxon ranksum tests, were used to compare bacterial loads between ear states. linear regression was used to examine the relationships between the bacterial loads and interacting variables such as age and antibiotic use (2 weeks before swab was taken) by RTQ-PCR most swabs were positive for M. catarrhalis (96%), H. influenzae (91%) and S. pneumoniae (89%). by RTQ-PCR most swabs were positive for all ear states. HRV (38%) was the most frequently encountered virus, followed by HPyV (14%), HAdV (13%), HBoV (8%) and HCoV (4%). other viruses (FLUA and B, PIV 1,2 and 3, HMPV, RSV and EV) were only found in 9% collectively. the total bacterial loads were all greater than 107, showing no trend for ear state. the geometric mean bacterial loads are segregated by clinical ear state. a significantly higher load was seen for M. catarrhalis, H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae in children with AOM compared to Normal ear states. the dotted line represents the baseline mean load in the absence of viral co-infection. the dotted line represents the baseline mean load in the absence of viral co-infection. 0.041 Antibiotics Yes 193 12.82(4.96) 0.22(-0.36 to 0.81) 0.455 (2 weeks) No 173 13.41(4.00) Number of viruses 0 138 12.35(5.13) Baselevel -- 1 153 13.34(4.35) 0.65(-0.01 to 1.30) 0.05 >1 75 13.98(3.46) 1.00(0.21 to 1.81) 0.013 Overall 0.029 S. pneumoniae Sex Male 180 12.22(3.96) - 0.464 3-6mo 95 17.71(1.44) 0.46(-0.14 to 1.06) 0.131 6-9mo 122 17.45(1.76) 0.21(-0.37 to 0.79) 0.48 9-12mo 71 17.10(1.50) -0.15(-0.78 to 0.48) 0.646 >12mo 42 17.25(1.46) Baselevel -- Overall 0.185 Antibiotics Yes 193 17.36(1.61) 0.14(-0.20 to 0.48) RTQ-PCR and clinical ear state was consistent with original semi-quantitative microbiology. of the 356 swabs cultured for M. catarrhalis, 82% were culture positive and 96% were RTQ-PCR positive. 75% were culture positive and 91% were RTQ-PCR positive. the nasopharynx and the middle ear show concordance of infection. studies suggest a lapse of 3-10 days between upper respiratory symptoms and onset of otitis media. 58 (16%) swabs were from children diagnosed with tympanic membrane perforation. by RTQ-PCR most swabs were positive for M. catarrhalis (96%), H. influenzae (91%) and S. pneumoniae (89%). by RTQ-PCR most swabs were positive for all ear states. more children from the AOM group were positive for each of the bacteria. HRV (38%) was the most frequently encountered virus, followed by HPyV (14%), HAdV (13%), HBoV (8%) and HCoV (4%). other viruses (FLUA and B, PIV 1,2 and 3, HMPV, RSV and EV) were only found in 9% collectively. the total bacterial loads were all greater than 107, showing no trend for ear state. the geometric mean bacterial loads are segregated by clinical ear state. a significantly higher load was seen for M. catarrhalis, H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae in children with AOM compared to Normal ear states.

TS's laboratory screened the swabs for the 17 respiratory viruses. DW performed the DNA extractions and PCR assays to identify the viruses. AJL concepted this study and contributed significantly to the analysis and editing of this manuscript."}
