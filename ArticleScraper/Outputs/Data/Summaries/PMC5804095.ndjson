{"summary": "Currently approved antiviral drugs treat fewer than ten viral infections. a majority of these drugs are direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) that target proteins encoded by individual viruses. this approach provides a narrow spectrum of coverage and therefore cannot address the large clinical need. kinases hijack a large number of host kinases at distinct steps of their life cycle. some of these host kinases are broadly required and thus represent attractive targets for broad-spectrum therapy. findings combined with development and approval of a large number of kinase inhibitors for the treatment of cancer.

EGFR-mediated signaling is implicated in the endocytosis of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and influenza A virus (IAV) erlotinib and gefitinib inhibited HCV and HCMV infections in a mouse and guinea pig model, respectively. erlotinib and gefitinib inhibited HCV and HCMV infections in a mouse and guinea pig model. the replication of viruses from the Flaviviridae family is dependent on the activation of various SFKs, such as Fyn, Lyn, c-Src, and Csk (DENV) the unrelated HIV-1 also activates SFKs to effectively replicate. anticancer c-Abl inhibitors lacking anti-SFK activity inhibited replication of EBOV (Garcia et al., 2012), DENV (Clark et al., 2016), MERS-CoV and/or SARS-CoV (Dyall et al., 2014) in cultured cells. imatinib effectively reduced viral load, viral spread, and mortality. CDK6 and CDK9 have both been validated as potential antiviral targets in HIV-1 infection. hepatitis B virus increases activity of the kinase CDK4 (Gearhart and Bouchard, 2010) inhibition of phosphorylation of viral proteins plays a role in the case of IAV and varicella zoster virus. reduced intracellular dNTP availability and viral mRNA transcription is one mechanism by which palbociclib exerts its anti-HSV-1 and HIV-1 activities. a better understanding of the MOA of these compounds remains an important area of investigation. iflunomide suppresses Akt phosphorylation and is approved for rheumatoid arthritis treatment. treatment with leflunomide and the approved immunosuppressant mTOR inhibitors everolimus and sirolimus reduced BK viremia and disease progression in patients with BK virus nephropathy. simultaneous inhibition of several kinases or pathways by the same drug or drug combination could increase the effectiveness while minimizing viral resistance, as previously shown in cancer. erlotinib's effect on HCV entry was first attributed solely to its effect on EGFR, its known cancer target (Kd of 3.4 nM vs. 1 nM) these examples provide a proof-of-concept for the potential feasibility of repurposing approved kinase inhibitors as host-targeted broad-spectrum antiviral therapies to combat viral infections. compounds targeting other kinases have already demonstrated antiviral activity. such approaches may find utility in combination with other strategies being developed to combat viruses."}
