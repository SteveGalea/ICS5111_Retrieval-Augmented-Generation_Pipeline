{"summary": "six coVs have been reported to infect humans, including human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), OC43 (HCoV-OC43), NL63 (HCoV-NL63), HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and MERS-CoV. HCoV-229E belongs to type I enveloped virus. its spike (S), consisting of S1 and S2 subunits on viral membrane, plays vital roles in viral entry into the host cells. target cell proteases can activate S protein by cleaving it into S1 and S2 subunits. peptides derived from the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gp41 HR2 region possess highly potent HIV-1 fusion inhibitory activities [20,21,22]. peptides targeting the HR1 domains of the S proteins of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with potent viral fusion inhibitory activity [24,25,26]. in the native state, the fusion peptide (FP), heptad repeat 1 (HR1) and heptad repeat 2 (HR2) domains in the S2 subunit are shielded by the S1 subunit. in the receptor-binding state, the S1 subunit binds with receptor on the target cell surface. in the pre-hairpin state, the S1 subunit dissociates, and FP in the S2 subunit is inserted into the target cell 229E-HR1P and 229E-HR2P spanning residues 795\u2013850 in the HR1 domain and 1053\u20131102 in the HR2 domain of HCoV-229E spike protein respectively. we incubated 229E-HR1P in phosphate buffer saline at 40 M with 229E-HR2P at 20, 40, and 80 M, respectively. 229E-HR1P alone showed no band in the gel (lane 1) because this peptide carries net positive charges. however, the mixtures of 229E-HR1P at 40 M and 229E-HR2P at 20, 40 and 80 M, respectively, showed new bands corresponding to the 6-HB at the upper part in the gel (lane 2). HCoV-229E HR1 and HR2 domains are capable of harboring the biological activity required to mimic viral fusion core structure by forming 6-HB in vitro. the 229E-HR1P/229E-HR2P complex provides a useful model for studying the detailed role of the HCoV-229E 6-HB fusion core. 293T/229E/EGFP cells that express no HCoV-229E S protein on cell surface could not fuse with the target cells. each of these cells contained only one nucleus, suggesting that the effector cells cannot spontaneously fuse with each other or do not undergo propagating divisions. trypsin could effectively promote cell-cell fusion in a time- and dose-dependent manner. cocultured at 37 \u00b0C for 3\u20136 h, stained with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and then photographed under an optical microscope with fluorescence microscopy (upper left) and DAPI (middle) the overlap picture shows that each of the fused cells contains two or more nuclei. inhibitory activities of 229E-HR1P and 229E-HR2P on cell-cell fusion mediated by HCoV-229E S protein or vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G protein. results further confirm that 229E-HR2P is more effective than 229E-HR1P in inhibiting HCoV-229E pseudovirus infection. 229E-HR1P and 229E-HR2P-HCoV-229E pseudovirus (PsV) infection in Huh-7 cells. 229E-HR1P- and 229E-HR2P-mediated inhibition of HCoV-229E infection and replication in A549 cells. 229E-HR1P and 229E-HR2P were used as target cells in assays for cell-cell fusion. neither 229E-HR1P nor 229E-HR2P had significant cytotoxicity to these cells at concentrations up to 1,000 M. the selectivity index (SI: CC50/IC50) of 229E-HR2P was more than 500. 229E-HR2P may not be degraded by proteolytic enzymes. the peptide can maintain effective antiviral activity in both upper and lower respiratory tracts against HCoV-229E-mediated cell-cell fusion. peptide (FP), heptad repeat 1 (HR1), heptad repeat 2 (HR2), transmembrane domain (TM) and cytoplasmic domain (CP) 229E-HR1P and 229E-HR2P derived from HR1 and HR2 domains are shown in the diagram. 229E-HR1P and 229E-HR2P at 20, 40 and 80 M, respectively, showed new bands corresponding to the 6-HB at the upper part in the gel (lanes 3, 4 and 5) to further study characteristics of the interaction between 229E-HR1P and 229E-HR2P, we determined the secondary structures of 229E-HR1P, 229E-HR2P and their complex in mixture (229E-HR1P/229E-HR2P) fected cells could form syncytia with uninfected cells in the presence of trypsin [19], suggesting that the S protein on HCoV-229E-infected cells may mediate the fusion between infected and uninfected cells. to assess the inhibitory activities of 229E-HR1P and 229E-HR2P, we established a cell-cell fusion model. trypsin could effectively promote cell-cell fusion in a time- and dose-dependent manner. this finding confirms that HCoV-229E S protein can mediate membrane fusion between effector cells and target cells followed by syncytium formation. this finding suggests that this cell-cell fusion assay can be used to study HCoV-229E S protein-mediated membrane fusion process. 229E-HR1P and 229E-HR2P could effectively inhibit HCoV-229E S-mediated cell-cell fusion with IC50 of 5.7 and 0.3 M respectively. they showed no significant inhibition of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G protein-mediated cell-cell fusion at the concentration as high as 10 M. 229E-HR1P and 229E-HR2P could significantly inhibit HCoV-229E pseudovirus infection in a dose-dependent manner, with an IC50 value of 0.5 M. 229E-HR2P is more effective than 229E-HR1P in inhibiting HCoV-229E pseudovirus infection. 229E-HR1P and 229E-HR2P-mediated inhibition of HCoV-229E infection and replication in Huh-7 and A549 cells. 229E-HR1P and 229E-HR2P could effectively inhibit HCoV-229E infection and replication in Huh-7 and A549 cells. 229E-HR1P and 229E-HR2P exhibited significant viral membrane fusion-inhibitory activity. the peptide can maintain effective antiviral activity in both upper and lower respiratory tracts against HCoV-229E infection. fusion inhibitory activity of upper respiratory tract lavage fluid of mice treated with or without 229E-HR2P. data are means SD of triplicate samples from a representative experiment. asterisks represent significant differences: ** p 0.01; * p 0.05. HCoV-229E HR1P peptide has higher -helicity than that from either SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV. the peptide derived from the HIV-1 gp41 HR1 domain could not form -helical trimer in solution. however, the N28Fd could form -helical trimer in solution and exhibit potent anti-HIV-1 activity. HCoV-229E-specific fusion inhibitory peptides are expected to inhibit membrane fusion mediated by HCoV-229E S protein that is proteolytically processed by TMPRSS2. different coronaviruses possess different infection characteristics in the human respiratory tract. some studies have shown that HCoV-229E mainly causes lower respiratory tract infection in pediatric cases. 229E-HR1P and 229E-HR2P inhibit fusion and entry of HCoV-229E into the target cells by targeting HR2 or HR1 respectively. the combination of 229E-HR1P and 229E-HR2P and the above inhibitors with different antiviral mechanisms may have a synergistic effect against HCoV-229E infection. all cell culture media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Biowest, Loire Valley, France) and the antibiotics penicillin and streptomycin (Cytogen, Wetzlar, Germany) cells were maintained at 37 \u00b0C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. peptide 229E-HR2P was incubated with an equal molar concentration of 229E-HR2P at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min. the final concentration of each peptide was 10 M in PBS (pH 7.2) id pAAV-229E-IRES-EGFP into 293T cells (293T/229E/EGFP) to transiently express GFP protein in cytoplasm and 229E-S on the membrane surface. then, 293T/229E/EGFP cells cultured alone or cocultured with Huh-7 cells at 37 \u00b0C for 3\u20136 h. after further coculture at 37 \u00b0C for 24 h, the fused and unfused the number of fused and unfused cells was counted. the percentage inhibition of cell-cell fusion was calculated according to the previously described method. 4.7.
