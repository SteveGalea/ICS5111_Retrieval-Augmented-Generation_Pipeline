{"summary": "the development of miniaturized PCR chips becomes possible (2,3) with the advent of micro-electro-mechanical-systems (MEMS) technology. the development of PCR microchips has been discussed in recent reviews. the reader may wish to refer to several reviews of general microfluidic technologies (5\u20139) in PCR chips are discussed, which include thermal insulation, evaporation and gas-bubble formation and measures to counteract these phenomena. e.g. off-line and on-line detection are covered, followed by integration of functional components in PCR chips, biological samples used in PCR chips and potential applications of PCR chips. PDMS, an inexpensive elastomeric polymer, has emerged as a promising substrate. it exhibits high flexibility, better optical transparency, lower cost of fabrication and better biocompatibility than silicon. PDMS adsorbs less PCR sample than other materials. the hydrophilic PCR solution is not easily introduced into the hydrophobic chip (28) a proper surface treatment is required to ensure the success of on-chip PCR. the treatment processes can be classified as static treatment and dynamic treatment. Legendre et al. developed a rapid (5 min) and simple (one-step) Sigmacoat\u00ae silanization method on a dry glass surface without extensive rinsing and cleaning steps often associated with other chip coating procedures (29). this dynamic treatment occurs during the actual operation of PCR chips because the reagents are in the PCR solution because the reagents are in the PCR solution. olefin copolymer (65), Gene Frame\u00ae (70), perfluoroalkoxy-modified polytetrafluoroethylene (PFA) (13,71\u201376), LiNbO3 (77) and 317 stainless steel (78) have also been used in PCR microfluidic devices. the superior thermal conductivity of silicon makes rapid PCR cycling possible. the permeability of PDMS can result in diffusional loss of biological sample. implantation of polyethylene vapor barrier in the PDMS has been proposed to prevent this fluid loss (53). biocompatible PMMA is another suitable candidate. Sigmacoat\u00ae (16,29) or trimethylchlorosilane (33) is a reproducible and inexpensive standard MEMS process and can be accomplished in a batch fashion. it is argued that diacrylated PEG (DAPEG) can be grafted into PDMS polymer for polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEM) deposition. the first PCR chip developed by northrup et al. in 1993 was based on such a stationary chamber. this format has been widely replicated and improved (2\u20134). chamber-based PCR chips are constructed as closed systems where the reaction chamber(s) are actually microfabricated on the chip. the concept of virtual reaction chamber (VRC) was applied for the first time on the PCR chip in 2005. the continuous-flow PCR concept was introduced by Nakano et al. in 1994. in 1998, Kopp et al. reported a continuous-flow PCR chip using a serpentine channel passing through three thermostable copper blocks. however, such PCR chips have undergone substantial improvements. a hybrid chip incorporating the continuous-flow PCR, LDR and hybridization assays has been proposed by Hashimoto et al. to perform analysis of single base mutations in genomic DNA. this is significant work because it opens the door to the integration of the continuous-flow PCR with pre-PCR or post-PCR analytical step. microfluidic digital PCR (23,71,72,89\u201393) is another example of the power of microfluidic PCR chips. it can provide precise control of sample volume and high-throughput analysis of serial (23,71,72,89\u201391) or parallel (93,92) format. however, such systems easily suffer from cross-contamination between samples and sample dispersion. the first PCR chip developed by northrup et al. in 1993 was based on such a stationary chamber (84) this format has been widely replicated and improved (2\u20134). the first PCR chip developed in 1993 was based on such a stationary chamber (84) chamber-based PCR chips are constructed as closed systems where the reaction chamber(s) are actually microfabricated on the chip. the concept of virtual reaction chamber (VRC) was applied for the first time on the PCR chip in 2005. the continuous-flow PCR concept was introduced by Nakano et al. in 1994. in 1998, Kopp et al. reported a continuous-flow PCR chip using a serpentine channel passing through three thermostable copper blocks. however, such PCR chips have undergone substantial improvements. al. have proposed a novel EOF-driven continuous-flow PCR on a serpentine channel chip on the basis of numeric simulation (87). similar work was also reported by Chen et al. (56). an oscillatory-flow-based approach (23,64,65) provides the possibility of performing high-throughput PCR amplifications in a parallel format (64) microfluidic digital PCR (23,71,72,89\u201393) represents another example of the power of microfluidic PCR chips. quantification relies only on binary, positive/negative calls for each subreaction within the partitioned analyte. this affords an absolute readout of DNA copy number with single-molecule resolution (93), allowing for transcription factor profiling in individual hematopoietic progenitors (93) and multigene analysis of individual environmental bacteria (92). large-volume (>3 l) on-chip PCRs are still in use (see Table 1). large-volume (>3 l) on-chip PCRs are still in use (see Table 1). volume and heating/cooling rates of PCR chips Reaction volume (nl) Heating rate (\u00b0C/s) Cooling rate (\u00b0C/s) Amplification time (s)/Cycle number Amplicon length (bp) References Chamber PCR Small volume 0.45 240 (49) 33 (78) 40 6000 or 3720/40 74 (17) 100 175 125 340/40 82 (80) 200 10\u201350 5 600/30 150/1382 (77) the use of small-volume PCR does not necessarily reduce amplification time if the heating method does not fully use the advantages of small-volume reaction system (17,43,49,78) there is no definitive correlation between PCR time and PCR volume. PCR speed ultimately depends on the thermal mass of the entire PCR system. to date, the fastest heating rate (175\u00b0C/s) and cooling rate (125\u00b0C/s) have been obtained using this method (80) to reduce costs, the temperature control chip can be physically separated from the PCR reaction chip and reused after initial temperature calibration (20,46,48,79,80). the temperature transition time depends only on the sample thermal mass. the speed of continuous-flow PCR is limited only by the synthesis rate of the DNA polymerase. in the 30-cycle continuous-flow PCR chip proposed by Kim et al., only 8\u201330 min were required to produce a detectable amount of 430-bp PCR products (44) viovy's group performed continuous-flow, high-throughput PCR amplification using droplets in an immiscible, fluorinated oil/fluorosurfactant solvent. stability of droplet trains is essential for eliminating cross contamination between droplets. use of differential hydrophilic/hydrophobic coating. if the chips are cleaned with organic solvents or strong detergents, the carryover cross contamination from run-to-run can be effectively eliminated. if each PCR chip is sealed with a cover immediately after loading the sample, contamination is less likely. if each PCR chip is sealed with a cover immediately after loading the sample, contamination is less likely. t al. recently proposed a new technology using parylene-cross-linking structure to achieve air gap thermal isolation for on-chip continuous-flow PCR (81). this technology provides excellent thermal isolation efficiency. its simplicity of integration with other analytical components also makes applications of micro total analysis systems (TAS) feasible. evaporation rate decreases with the increase of the gas pressure around a liquid. a single opening serves for both sample loading and syringe pump port. a single opening serves for both sample loading and syringe pump port. a single opening serves for both sample loading and syringe pump port. ii) The sealing pressurization of the PCR chamber. under pressurization and high-temperature, the gas solubility will increase. this process can eliminate non-condensable gases in the PCR sample. this process can eliminate non-condensable gases before loading. invasive temperature measurements are still most widely used (4). invasive temperature measurement involves a disturbance, which manifests itself as a difference between the temperature being measured and that which would exist in the absence of the temperature-measuring element. invasive temperature measurement involves a modification of the component in the PCR solution. the chip used in this work has the smallest volume (ca. 1 l) that has been reported in TLC thermometry (18). Kim et al. used the TLC thermometry to measure the temperature at the Raman calibration point to calibrate the Raman intensity of O\u2013H stretch band of water with temperature (15). noninvasive temperature measurement techniques for PCR chips. IR devices are sensitive to the spectrum in the infrared region. optimum techniques such as absorption and emission spectroscopy are sensitive. spectroscopy-based temperature measurement has been successfully applied to the PCR chips. the diameter of the laser beam can be adjusted to 1 m and the perturbation of the fluid condition can be negligible. the laser beam can be focused anywhere inside the chamber/channel to allow the whole field temperature measurement. numerical simulation is thought to be a very effective approach. it can provide the opportunity to evaluate flow, thermal and even chemical processes during PCR (4). a great attention has been focused on the numerical simulation of the continuous-flow PCR chips. thermal isolation should also be used to eliminate or weaken the thermal crosstalk between chambers within the PCR array chip. thermal isolation should also be used to eliminate or weaken the thermal crosstalk between chambers within the PCR array chip. this technology provides excellent thermal isolation efficiency. evaporation and its Inhibition Measures of PCR Sample Sample evaporation is often problematic because PCR volumes are usually very small. the sample evaporation is so rapid that the sample would dry up quickly under standard atmospheric pressure. the formation of air bubbles has two prerequisites: the liquid must be superheated and there must be nucleation site(s) a diamond-shaped or rhomboidal chamber is superior to a circular chamber in preventing bubble formation (10,51) a diamond-shaped chamber is superior to a circular chamber in preventing bubble formation. invasive temperature measurement techniques for PCR chips can be classified into three categories based on the nature of the contact mode between the temperature measuring element and the PCR solution. invasive temperature measurement involves a disturbance, which manifests itself as a difference between the temperature being measured and that which would exist in the absence of the temperature-measuring element. semi-invasive temperature measurement based on TLCs TLCs are substances with a molecular structure intermediate between a crystalline solid and an isotropic liquid. cholesteric liquid crystals (commonly called TLCs) are optically active since they react to changes in temperature and shear stress by changing their color. rhodamine B, one of most widely used temperature sensitive dyes, has been used to evaluate the accuracy of the in-channel temperature measured by K-type thermocouple or numerical simulation (39). rhodamine B, one of most widely used temperature sensitive dyes, has been used to evaluate the accuracy of the in-channel temperature measured by K-type thermocouple or by numerical simulation (39). Kim et al. used the TLC thermometry to measure the temperature at the Raman calibration point to calibrate the Raman intensity of O\u2013H stretch band of water with temperature (15). TLC solution has also been used to determine the rate of temperature change in the PCR microchannel (64). noninvasive temperature measurement techniques for PCR chips.

CE chip platform can offer walkaway and unattended analysis of DNA molecules. the manual sample loading may increase the risk of cross contamination. some of the on-line detection methods described below may soon be routinely implemented for on-chip quantitative and/or qualitative PCR detection. hybrid DNA analytical chip that performs PCR in a silicon microheater and CE in a glass chip was first reported by Woolley et al. in 1996. the integrated PCR-CE chip is still a burgeoning research area. a four-lane PCR-CE chip is capable of performing multiple (RT-) PCR-CE analyses in parallel (31,35) the chips are capable of performing multiple (RT-) PCR-CE analyses in parallel (31,35) the end-point detection measures the fluorescence only before and after PCR amplification. it is difficult to obtain reliable results if the DNA template concentrations are calculated only by fluorescence signals. the real-time method has become popular. hybrid DNA analytical chip performed PCR in a silicon microheater and CE in a glass chip. the integrated PCR-CE chip is still a burgeoning research area (26,27,31\u201333,35,40,43) hybridization and PCR amplification can be incorporated on a single chip to directly detect the PCR products. for example, Guttenberg et al. applied the PCR and/or LDR chips combined to hybridization microarrays to detect low-abundance DNA point mutations in a continuous-flow format. the partially integrated PCR chips have been successfully developed. the 'complete' lab-on-a-chip still requires further development. bottlenecks blocking the realization of a truly and highly integrated PCR chip include on-chip pre-PCR sample preparation and on-chip PCR product detection. cDNA are reverse transcription from the corresponding RNAs. cDNA may include cDNA from sorted CD19+ malignant B cells (52), cDNA from brain tissue from transgenic GFAP\u2013GFP mice (80), cDNA from human breast cancer cell lines T47D (71), cDNA from human heart and human liver samples (78) and influenza viral cDNA (32). lowest mutant:wide-type ratio that could be detected by this chip was up to 1:80. lowest mutant:wide-type ratio that could be detected by this chip was up to 1:80. total assay time was 50 min, including 18.7 min for PCR, 8.1 min for LDR, 5 min for hybridization, 10 min for washing and 2.6 min for fluorescence scanning. the development of fully integrated PCR chips is limited by complicated design and fabricating process. many PCR chips can only perform the DNA/RNA amplification. the development of the highly integrated PCR chips is limited by complicated design and fabricating process. microstructures should make a full use of the better MEMS procedures to meet the requirements of each bioassay procedure to enable them to be widely customized to accomplish specific bioassays."}
