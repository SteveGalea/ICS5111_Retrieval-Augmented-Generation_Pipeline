{"summary": "Currently available influenza vaccines have effectively reduced disease incidence. however, 3\u20135 million cases of severe illness are reported annually, with 250,000\u2013500,000 deaths. new seasonal vaccines need to be formulated annually, which is a time-consuming process. outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are phospholipid bilayer vesicles produced naturally by Gram-negative bacteria. they have been studied as a vaccine candidate against pathogenic bacteria such as Vibrio cholerae and Borrelia burgdorferi [17, 18] fmOMV elicits host innate immune response against influenza virus infection. intranasal administration of fmOMV resulted in the recruitment and activation of macrophages in the lung tissue. these macrophages sufficiently protect infection from different influenza viruses. mice were seeded at 5 104 cells/well in 96-well plates. they were treated with fmOMV or control reagents. mice were challenged with a 10 lethal dose 50 (LD50) of PR8, pH1N1, H5N2. trivalent split influenza vaccine containing a/California/7/2009 (H1N1), A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3N2), and B/Massachusetts/2/2012 (1.0 g of HA/mouse, Green Cross, Korea) was immunized either intranasally (Fig. 2) or intramuscularly (Fig. 5) twice at a 2-week interval. the vaccine-immunized groups were f IFN--secreting T cells were estimated by enzyme-linked immunospot assay. a Mice (n = 8\u20139) were injected with fmOMV and challenged with 10 LD50 of PR8, H5N2 and highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza viruses. splenocytes (5 105 cells/well) were incubated with inactivated pH1N1 virus on ELISPOT plates coated with IFN- capture antibody. after 40-h incubation, plates were further incubated with biotinylated IFN- detection antibody and then horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin. titer was expressed as log10 of the 50% tissue culture-infective dose (TCID50) per Flow Cytometry Samples were resuspended in fluorescence-activated cell sorting buffer (PBS containing 2.5% FBS and 0.1% sodium azide) cells were stained for CD11b, CD11c, SiglectF, CD40, CD45, CD80, CD86, MHC class II, F4/80, and Ly6G (eBioscience) fmOMV fmOMV was produced by transforming a mutant strain with pWSK29-LpxF plasmid as previous ly reported [23]. fmOMV in the filtrate were precipitated in 390 g/L ammonium sulphate solution. pellets were centrifuged again at 16,000 g for 15 min. TM mTLR2, mTLR3, mTLR4, mTLR5, or mTLR9 (Invivogen, CA, USA) cell lines were maintained in RPMI1640 media. each cell line was resuspended in HEK-BlueTM Detection media. each cell line was resuspended in HEK-BlueTM Detection media. mice were challenged with a 10 lethal dose 50 (LD50) of PR8, pH1N1, H5N2 or highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses. the trivalent split influenza vaccine containing A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) and A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3N2) was immunized either intranasally or intramuscularly. the vaccinated group was immunized intramuscularly with pH1N1 split vaccine followed by a booster injection after 2 weeks (n = 8). two weeks after the second injection, the mice were challenged with each virus. ELISPOT plates coated with vaccine antigen were coated with 200 ng/well. antibodies were detected by sequential incubation with peroxidase goat anti-mouse total IgG (Cell Signaling Technology, MA, USA) and 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine substrate. Flow Cytometry Samples were resuspended in fluorescence-activated cell sorting buffer (PBS containing 2.5% FBS and 0.1% sodium azide) after washing, cells were stained for CD11b, CD11c, SiglectF, CD40, CD45, CD80, CD86, MHC class II, F4/80, and Ly6G (eBioscience, CA, USA) quantitative RT-PCR was performed using specific primers (IFN-: sense, 5\u2032-ATGGCTAGGCTCTCTGTGC\u00adTTTCCT-3\u2032, antisense, 5\u2032-AGGGCTC CAGACTTCTGCT\u00adCTG-3\u2032; HPRT-: sense, 5\u2032-CCCTATGGAGATGACGGA-3\u2032, antisense, 5\u2032-TCCCACGTCTT TCCTC-3\u2032) treatment with fmOMV induced TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, and TLR9 signaling in a dose-dependent manner. fmOMV treatment elicits innate immunity required to generate antiviral host immunity via simultaneous triggering of various TLR signaling. mice were challenged both 5 and 14 days after immunization with fmOMV. fmOMV-induced antiviral effect is not associated with adaptive immunity. fmOMV-induced antiviral effect is not associated with adaptive immunity. macrophages and neutrophils comprise the majority of innate immune cells responsible for the antiviral response in an influenza infection model [27], we measured the change in counts of macrophages and neutrophils in the lungs. both cell counts significantly increased after fmOMV injection. depletion of macrophages completely abrogated antiviral effect by fmOMV administration. macrophages play an important role in antiviral effect by fmOMV against influenza virus infection. fmOMV activates macrophages and induces antiviral cytokines. Alexa Fluor 488 (Alexa488)-labeled fmOMV was analyzed after 3 h. levels of type I interferons, IL-1, and C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) in the lungs were determined. fmOMV injection increased the level of IFN- and, IL-1, and C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2, MCP-1) in the lung tissue. fmOMV activated the innate immune system leading to antiviral soluble factors. we also challenged fmOMV-injected mice with PR8, H5N2 and highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses. the body weight of mice administered fmOMV significantly declined upon viral challenge compared to that of mice administered fmOMV. inflammation in the lung tissue was not observed when fmOMV was intranasally injected. fmOMV provides broad and potent protection against diverse influenza A viruses without endotoxic inflammation. the extent of fmOMV- or TLR ligand-induced TLR stimulation was determined by mea\u00adsuring secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase activity. data are presented as mean standard deviation from triplicate culture wells, at optical density (OD) of 570 nm. the viral titer in the lungs was the lowest at 3 days after fmOMV injection. however, survival rates decreased with an increase in the interval between fmOMV injection and pH1N1 virus challenge. fmOMV-induced antiviral effect is not associated with adaptive immunity. the CD45+F4/80+ macrophage population was subdivided in terms of CD11b and CD11c expression. mice were injected with fmOMV intranasally and infected with 10 LD50 of pH1N1 at 3 days after fmOMV injection. fmOMV activates macrophages and induces antiviral cytokines. at 3 h, 94.2% of fmOMV-Alexa488 cells were Alexa488-positive. fmOMV activates macrophages and induces antiviral cytokines. data are presented as mean SEM and representative of at least three independent experiments. macrophages are indispensable for the fmOMV-mediated antiviral effect. the activation markers, such as CD40, CD80, CD86, and MHC class II, were upregulated after fmOMV injection. eighty to one hundred percent of the fmOMV-injected mice survived the viral challenge at 3 days after fmOMV injection. the protective effect of fmOMV was compared with other TLR ligands: Pam3, LPS, flagellin, and CpG. fmOMV completely protected against lethal influenza virus challenge. cell depletion and subtype analysis studies revealed an increase and activation of macrophages by fmOMV injection provided broad-spectrum antiviral effects. AMs produce type I IFNs that play an important role in the protection against influenza viruses by both inhibiting viral replication and suppressing excessive tissue inflammation. inflammatory macrophages suppress viral replication after influenza virus infection. fmOMV injection may transform recruited macrophages to hyperresponsive state. inflammatory macrophages suppress viral replication after influenza virus infection. antiviral activities of neutrophils are associated with secretion of antiviral molecules such as long-chain pentraxin (PTX3) and defensin. these molecules are secreted from neutrophils after activation via interaction directly with influenza virus or virus-induced molecular inflammatory milieu. viral load and inflammatory cytokines may have been insufficient to activate neutrophils to produce antiviral molecules after influenza virus infection. fmOMV injection protected against infection by a wide spectrum of IAV strains. this antiviral effect was mediated by infiltrated macrophages. the authors declare that they have no competing interests. ies through Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs Research Center Support Program. funded by the ministry of agriculture, food and rural affairs (716002-7)."}
