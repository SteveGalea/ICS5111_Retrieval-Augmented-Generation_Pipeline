{"summary": "spread may be via direct contact, over short distances on large \u2018cough\u2019 droplets (diameter >10 m), over longer distances in aerosols of small droplet nuclei (diameter >10 m) and on fomites. meteorological variables such as air temperature, relative humidity, rainfall and wind have been suggested as important drivers of the spread of influenza. research on detailed animal outbreak datasets has several advantages over comparable research on public health influenza data. human populations move about on a daily basis (albeit with some regularity) implementation of a complete human movement standstill is considered an extraordinary and perhaps unfeasible social distancing measure reserved for the most severe of human influenza pandemics. the typical incubation period of equine influenza is 1\u20133 days [23], [24], [25], but delayed onset of clinical signs of up to 5 days has been observed after low dose aerosol exposure. over the course of 4 months, nearly 70 000 horses were infected, on over 9 000 premises in two Australian States. vaccination was initially restricted to disease containment zones and the protection of high value horses. previous epidemiological analyses of this outbreak have investigated spatial and network components of early spread [29], [30], [31], [32], and premises-level risk factors for disease spread. in one cluster of 437 infected premises, a relationship was observed between prevailing wind conditions and the global direction of spread [13]. this spatio-temporal analysis aims to identify and quantify the association between four meteorological variables (air temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, wind velocity) and time to infection. a single 'index' for the 2007 outbreak of equine influenza in australia was selected for inclusion in the study. premises were selected for inclusion in the study if their centroid was within 15 km of nine contact-traced \u2018source\u2019 premises. the \u2018Northwest Sydney\u2019 cluster studied was approximately 65 km in diameter, bounded to the North and West by national parks. clinical signs were first observed on 17 August 2007 in a horse in quarantine at Eastern Creek Quarantine Station (red closed circle) the cluster is surrounded by national parks and urban areas. data was structured into a daily \u2018counting process\u2019 formulation. each premises contributes one observation for every day that it is at risk. each observation contains covariates for the subject at each time point of observation and a start and stop time denoting interval of risk. there is no overlap in intervals of risk in the set of observations for each subject. the likelihood never involves more than one observation for a subject. we excluded premises that may have been infected in the first 10 days of the outbreak, before the complete implementation of horse movement bans. variables analysed for associations with time to infection of premises in the largest cluster, northwest of Sydney, during the 2007 equine influenza outbreak in australia. variables analysed for associations with time to infection of premises in the largest cluster, northwest of Sydney. 132 weather stations were operated by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology during the study period. each time-varying meteorological covariate was time-lagged by 1\u20135 days to encompass the full range of incubation periods observed in experimental infection studies. hourly wind velocity data from sixteen automated weather stations were converted into their east-to-west (\u2018u\u2019) and north-to-South (\u2018v\u2019) components. for each premises on each day prior to infection, the (\u2018directed\u2019) maximum wind speed originating within 45( arcs centred on the direction of the nearest 1\u20133 infected premises was estimated for time lags of 1\u20135 days. hourly wind velocity vectors were interpolated for each premises and back-transformed into the original polar coordinates. to test the directionality of wind exposure risk we generated \u2018directed\u2019 maximum daily wind speed covariates (\u2018WIND_SPDundir\u2019) without making any directional assumptions. time-varying predictors were lagged by 1\u20135 days to serve as proxies for wind within the range of incubation periods that have been observed for equine influenza. 20 time-lagged explanatory covariates were produced: \u2018WIND_SPDundir t1, t2,..., t5\u2019 and \u2018WIND_SPDdir(k) t1, t2,..., t5\u2019. all continuous covariates were tested for collinearity in pairs by calculating Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. intrainsic temporal autocorrelation was expected amongst certain groups of time-lagged time-varying meteorological predictors. only the variable with the strongest statistical association with the outcome was retained for further analysis. state government of new south Wales provided contact-tracing and laboratory testing data on all horses investigated during the 2007 outbreak. premises attribute records included address, geocoded coordinates (based on premises centroid), number of horses, date of onset of clinical signs in the first horse affected (\u2018onset date\u2019), vaccination status and date of vaccination. premises were defined as infected (IP) if they held horses that had been observed with the classical clinical signs of equine influenza (cough, elevated temperature the 15 km buffer used to delineate the cluster was selected based on an earlier likelihood-based analysis. 98% of premises infected in the first month of the outbreak were within this distance of a contact-traced \u2018source\u2019 premises. the \u2018Northwest Sydney\u2019 cluster studied was approximately 65 km in diameter, bounded to the North and West by national parks. relative risk surfaces with upper 95% tolerance contours were estimated as the Gaussian-smoothed kernel density surface of infected horse premises divided by the surface of the population of horse premises at risk in 4-week time periods. the amount of smoothing (bandwidth) applied varied across the study extent in inverse proportion to the population at risk in each time period. each subject contributes one observation for every day that it is at risk. each observation contains covariates for the subject at each time point of observation and a start and stop time. this enables covariate values for individual subjects to either be time-invariant or to change with time. premises boundaries were extracted from cadastral data provided by the NSW Government Department of Finance and Services. these boundaries were used to generate a continuous variable representing the length of fence each horse premises shared with any contiguous horse premises. a WIND_SPDundir t1,t2,...,t5 Maximum daily wind speed \u2013 directed (km hour1)a, b Premises AREA Area (acres) attributes HORSE_DENSITY Horse density (horses acre1) HORSES_NUMBER Number of

spatial dependency (autocorrelation) in spatially continuous data based on a covariance function. generation of wind speed covariates was available from sixteen weather stations. wind velocity data were supplied in a polar coordinate structure. the average direction of origin of the wind (in degrees from true north) and maximum wind speed (in kilometres hour(1), measured over the 10(minutes leading up to the observation time) based only on wind coming from within 45\u00b0 arcs centred on the bearing of the nearest k infected premises to each premises on each day. for each premises, on each day of observation, we identified the nearest three infected premises from among those infected premises that had a date of onset within the previous 14 days. variable representing the length of fence that each horse premises shared with any contiguous horse premises in the equine influenza dataset. premises elevation was extracted from a digital elevation model of Australia [45], which is a grid of ground level elevation covering the whole of Australia with a grid spacing of approximately 250 metres.

owing to a wide variance in local environmental characteristics and potential for differences in disease transmission dynamics, mixing clusters in the same analysis might dilute any meaningful results. a classical geostatistical approach [49] (kriging based on a least squares fit of an empirical variogram) may be more appropriate. a single global direction of spread has been noted [13] with the aim of estimating the typical contribution of wind to disease spread rather than circumstantially associating prevailing wind with the global direction of disease spread. our methods provide a means to answer this research question and to retrospectively investigate the contribution of windborne aerosol spread to local disease spread during outbreaks. the relationships described are of direct importance for managing disease risk during influenza outbreaks in horses. supporting information supporting information S1 Survival analysis dataset formulation examples and correlations between explanatory variables in Cox regression modelling of factors associated with time to infection in 2007 outbreak of equine influenza in Australia."}
