{"summary": "small and medium business sector is a major provider of private sector employment in many countries. but we have little information about the preparedness of this sector for pandemic influenza. findings suggest small and medium businesses in Australia are not well prepared for pandemic influenza. strategic plans have been prepared for an outbreak of pandemic influenza associated with human avian influenza infection. many of these plans include mechanisms to facilitate and manage community-wide responses in recognition of the likelihood that pandemic response requirements will exceed the response capacity of health authorities and governments. small and medium businesses are a major employer in Australia, accounting for approximately half of all private sector employees. protection motivation theory conceptualises an individual's acceptance of advice on how to protect themselves from a health threat as primarily a function of four specific beliefs. if a sufficient level of threat is perceived to exist, and coping appraisal is low, the individual is unlikely to take appropriate action. research has supported the importance of health belief model constructs in behaviour change [15] structured face-to-face interviews were conducted with owners or managers of 201 small or medium businesses in Australia. participants were recruited from New South Wales (101) and Western Australia (100) participants were randomly sampled from a purchased list of 1500 businesses stratified by industry type. the response categories for industry type were pre-coded based on the divisions in the 1993 Australian and New Zealand Standard Industrial Classification [18] for analysis purposes, businesses operating in the primary and secondary industry sectors were aggregated. the general belief about the severity of the threat was operationalised as the likelihood that pandemic influenza would become a significant health issue in Australia in the near future. an additional business-specific indicator of risk, the perceived level of risk that pandemic influenza poses to the interviewee's business, a small proportion of participants nominated the responses 'don't know' and 'no idea' to represent their beliefs about the risk and severity of pandemic influenza. the responses were aggregated with the other low risk or low severity responses for analysis purposes. this coding did not significantly affect the findings of the analysis. participants were asked how much have you thought about the impact of pandemic influenza on your business. the need for help with planning for pandemic influenza can be considered an indicator of an adaptive response to the threat of pandemic influenza. the presence of a plan for pandemic influenza was assessed by the single question. chi-square test of independence was used to test for associations between categorical study variables. independent samples t-test was used to test for differences between groups on continuous variables. 201 small or medium businesses were recruited from New South Wales (101) and western Australia (100) participants were selected from businesses located in capital cities (n = 140), 20 per cent from large satellite cities (n = 41) and 10 per cent from rural centres (n = 20) the response categories for industry type were pre-coded based on the divisions in the 1993 Australian and New Zealand Standard Industrial Classification [18] for analysis purposes, businesses operating in the primary and secondary industry sectors were aggregated. tertiary industry businesses were aggregated according to the following three industry type categories: property and business services; retail trade. these responses were aggregated with the other low risk or low severity responses for analysis purposes. these responses indicated an absence of perceptions of high risk or high severity. coding did not significantly affect the findings of the analysis. the need for help with planning for pandemic influenza was assessed using the following open-ended question: \"Is there anything you need to help you prepare for pandemic influenza\" Responses were dichotomised into a. analysis The chi-square test of independence was used to test for associations between categorical study variables. independent samples t-test was used to test for differences between groups on continuous variables. Dependent variables were dichotomised for analysis due to skewed distributions. most participating businesses had less than 20 employees and more than half of the individuals interviewed were business owners. non-participation was most frequently associated with the business owner or manager being either too busy or unavailable during the interview period. demic influenza was likely or very likely to become a significant health issue in Australia in the near future. around 40% of participants reported that they had not spent any time thinking about the impact of pandemic influenza on their business. only 6 per cent of participants reported having a pandemic influenza plan for their business (3 per cent were unsure), and over 60% of participants reported needing help to prepare for pandemic influenza. businesses in NSW were also significantly more likely to have a plan for pandemic influenza than businesses in each of the significant predictors of beliefs identified only explained a small proportion (less than 5 per cent) of the overall variance associated with the belief variables. n = 201) Adjusted OR (95% CI) Wald statistic* p Risk of pandemic influenza (Likely or Very likely) the significant independent predictors of dependent variables depend on the inclusion of both belief variables and business characteristics. the significant independent predictors of dependent variables, based on the inclusion of both belief variables and business characteristics, are summarised in Table 5. businesses that were located in the capital city were about three times more likely to have spent a lot of time thinking about the impact of a pandemic compared with businesses in satellite city or rural locations. the perceived need for help was most strongly associated with the perceived risk of pandemic influenza to the business. businesses in the property and business services and retail trade sectors were significantly less likely to report needing help than those in WA. industry type was not significantly associated with perceptions about the risk or severity of a pandemic, but significantly associated with coping appraisal. participants who believed 30 per cent or more of the local community would become sick were over 9 times more likely to have a plan. business owners were significantly more likely to be interviewed in WA than NSW (Table 1). most of the participating businesses operated within the tertiary or service sector. the representation of businesses from different industry types was significantly different by state. businesses in NSW were significantly more likely to have a plan for pandemic influenza than businesses in WA. however, the difference in response rate for the two states renders the generalisability of such differences as tenuous. 1.9 (1.1 \u2013 3.5) 4.65 0.03 *The Wald statistic indicates whether the independent variable is significantly associated with the dependent variable Odds ratio (OR) Predictors of dependent variables Bivariate associations between belief variables and dependent variables were significantly associated. there was no significant association between having a plan and the need for help, and coping appraisal was independent of perceptions of severity. logistic regression models were used to determine the significant independent predictors of having considered the impact of, having a plan for, and needing help to prepare for a pandemic. the significant independent predictors of dependent variables, based on the inclusion of both belief variables and business characteristics, are summarised in Table 5. businesses that were located in the capital city were about three times more likely to have spent a lot of time thinking about the impact of a pandemic on their business. the perceived need for help was most strongly associated with the perceived risk of pandemic influenza to the business, with participants who perceived the risk of a pandemic to the business as moderate or high. participants who believed 30 per cent or more of the local community would become sick were over 9 times more likely to have a plan. participants who identified steps that could be taken to protect their business were over 8 times more likely to have a plan for pandemic influenza. the study provides the first systematically collected information on preparedness among small and medium businesses in the field worldwide. beliefs about the risk of and severity of pandemic influenza were the most important predictors of having thought about, and having a plan for pandemic influenza respectively. perceived risk of pandemic influenza to the business was also the most important predictor of needing help to prepare. individual business characteristics were relatively unimportant among the predictors of having thought about or planned for pandemic influenza. industry type and state were significant predictors in addition to beliefs about risk. retail traders and businesses that provide property and business services were less likely to report the need for help. the associations found in this study explained a low proportion of variance in preparedness behaviour. the associations found in this study explained a low proportion of variance in preparedness behaviour. however, experimental research has provided support for the impact of beliefs on protection motivation and current behaviour. there is a shortage of data available to guide public health policy and practice in pandemic influenza planning and response. current guidance for pandemic influenza preparedness appears to have had little impact on preparedness among the small and medium business sectors in Australia. authors declare that they have no competing interests.
