{"summary": "GENOME ANNOUNCEMENT Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) belongs to the genus Gammacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae of the order Nidovirales (1). IBV is a highly contagious pathogen transmitted through the respiratory tract and causes infectious bronchitis. in its genome, two variant transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs) were found. a highly conserved TRS, CTTAACAA, located ahead of ORFs 1a, 1b, 3a, M, 5a, and N, and a variant TRS, AAGAACAA, located ahead of S. an amino acid deletion, 169T, in the N gene of CK/CH/HB/2016 was detected. the genome sequence of IBV strain CK/CH/HB/2016 was deposited in GenBank under the accession number MF882923. this result suggests that the spike genes of these IBV strains have the same origin."}
