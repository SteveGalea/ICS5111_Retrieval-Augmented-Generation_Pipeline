{"summary": "sheep were exposed to saline or BM acetate:phosphate 1:1 mixture at the 80th day of gestation via injections given to a pregnant ewe. at 6 mo, male offspring were brought to our facility where they were maintained on a normal diet. proteins were separated on 12% mini-PROTEAN TGX gels for 80 min at 120 V. immunodetection was performed on blots blocked for 1 h with 5% dry milk. antibody was raised against residues 25\u201334 (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe-His-Leu-Cys*; ANG I sequence) of the rat protein (25) the pellet was solubilized by resuspending in 10 l/mg tissue of 0.5% Triton. the following day, samples were spun at 28,000 g for 5 min. a fraction of the supernatant was saved as a nonenriched control. each reaction includes 0.5 nM 125I-labeled ANG I or 125I-labeled ANG II, and 1 M noniodinated ANG I or ANG II. the reaction was stopped after 120 min by addition of ice-cold 1.0% phosphoric acid and centrifuged at 16,000 g. PCMB-peptidase ANG-(1\u20137) was pooled separately from control and BMX animals. concentration was resuspended in 500 l of MHK buffer and protein concentration was measured using a Bradford protein assay. supernatants were centrifuged at 30,000 g for 20 min. solution was decanted and acidified with 1% n-heptafluorobutyric acid. ANG peptides were measured directly in the CSF. neprilysin inhibitor MLN4760 was provided by Merck (Madison, NJ) all other reagents were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) and BioRad (Hercules, CA) data are expressed as means SE. samples from a total of 32 animals were used in this study. the age of 6 mo was chosen because these animals exhibit a lower nephron number, higher blood pressure and lower BRS. ine residue (Cys*) was added for covalent coupling of the ANG I peptide to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. both rat and sheep contain the identical ANG I sequence (25) a fraction of the supernatant was saved as a nonenriched control. the pellet was discarded and centrifuged at 300 g for 15 min. the pellet was resuspended in a minimal volume of MHK buffer. amastatin (2 M), bestatin (10 M), chymostatin (10 M), benzyl succinate (10 M), and p-chloromercuribenzoic acid (PCMB; 0.5 mM) lisinopril to block ACE activity, SCH39370 for NEP activity, or MLN4760 for ACE2 activity (all at 10 M final concentration) the assays included amastatin (2 M), bestatin (10 M), chymostatin (10 M), benzyl succinate (10 M), and lisinopril (10 M) the inhibitory constant (Ki) of PCMB was determined by adding varying concentrations of PCMB (50 nM to 500 M) to a pool of control CSF. the ANG peptide content of each fraction was determined by separate RIAs for ANG I, ANG II, and ANG-(1\u20137) that fully recognize each peptide but cross-react less than 0.01% with each other. minimum detection levels for the assays are 1 fmol/ml, 0.8 fmol/ml, and 2.8 fmol/ml for ANG I, ANG II, and ANG-(1\u20137), respectively. animals were exposed to saline or BM acetate:phosphate 1:1 mixture at the 80th day of gestation via injections given to a pregnant ewe. animals were farm-raised and weaned at 3 mo of age. proteins were separated on 12% mini-PROTEAN TGX gels for 80 min at 120 V. immunodetection was performed on blots blocked for 1 h with 5% dry milk. antibody was raised against residues 25\u201334 (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe-His-Leu-Cys*; ANG I sequence) of the rat protein (25) the pellet was solubilized by resuspending in 10 l/mg tissue of 0.5% Triton. the following day, samples were spun at 28,000 g for 5 min. a fraction of the supernatant was saved as a nonenriched control. each reaction includes 0.5 nM 125I-labeled ANG I or 125I-labeled ANG II, and 1 M noniodinated ANG I or ANG II. the reaction was stopped after 120 min by addition of ice-cold 1.0% phosphoric acid and centrifuged at 16,000 g. PCMB-peptidase ANG-(1\u20137) was pooled separately from control and BMX animals. concentration was resuspended in 500 l of MHK buffer and protein concentration was measured using a Bradford protein assay. supernatants were centrifuged at 30,000 g for 20 min. solution was decanted and acidified with 1% n-heptafluorobutyric acid. ANG peptides were measured directly in the CSF. a neprilysin inhibitor was provided by Merck (West Point, PA) SCH39370, a neprilysin inhibitor, was provided by Schering-Plough (Madison, NJ). the ACE2 inhibitor MLN4760 was provided by Millennium Pharmaceuticals (Baltimore, MD). major bands were detected at 50 and 60 kDa via Western blot. no difference between control and BMX animals. protein expression normalized to -actin for quantification. activity was abolished with specific inhibitors to ACE + lisinopril (LIS); ACE2 + MLN (MLN4762); and NEP + SCH (SCH37392). ACE2 activity was significantly higher than either ACE or NEP (n = 10). ANG I, ANG II, and ANG-(1\u20137) were quantitated in the ChP4 from both groups. there were no significant differences between BMX and control animals for the individual peptides. ANG II was the predominant peptide in the ChP4 of both groups. a single 50-kDa band was detected in the CSF samples. there was no difference in protein expression between control and BMX animals. the time-course studies revealed a significantly higher rate of metabolism in both groups. the rate of 125I-labeled ANG-(1\u20137) metabolism did not appear to plateau with increasing concentrations of unlabeled ANG-(1\u20137) in control CSF. the rate of ANG-(1\u20137) metabolism did not appear to plateau with increasing concentrations of unlabeled ANG-(1\u20137) in controls. BMX animals have significantly more metabolism at the 120-min time point in the presence of no inhibitors, PCMB alone, and PCMB with LIS (n = 5 per group). major bands were detected at 50 and 60 kDa via Western blot. there was no difference between control and BMX animals. protein expression was normalized to -actin for quantification. activity abolished with specific inhibitors to ACE + lisinopril (LIS); ACE2 + MLN (MLN4762); and NEP + SCH (SCH37392) activity was abolished with specific inhibitors to ACE + lisinopril (LIS); ACE2 + MLN (MLN4762); and ACE2 + MLN (MLN4762); and ACE2 + MLN (MLN4762); and ACE ANG I, ANG II, and ANG-(1\u20137) were quantified in the ChP4 from both groups. no significant differences between BMX and control animals for the individual peptides. ANG II was the predominant peptide in the ChP4 of both groups. a single 50-kDa band was detected in the CSF samples for both groups via Western blot. there was no difference in protein expression between control and BMX animals. 125I-labeled ANG-(1\u20137) metabolism appeared to plateau with increasing concentrations of unlabeled ANG-(1\u20137) in control CSF. the rate of 125I-labeled ANG-(1\u20137) metabolism did not appear to plateau with increasing concentrations of unlabeled ANG-(1\u20137). BMX animals have significantly more metabolism at the 120-min time point in the presence of no inhibitors, PCMB alone, and PCMB with LIS (n = 5 per group). high-molecular-mass renin protein was detected as a single band at 60 kDa. there was no difference between control and BMX animals. activity was abolished with specific inhibitors to ACE + lisinopril (LIS); ACE2 + MLN (MLN4762); and NEP + SCH (SCH37392). ACE2 activity was significantly higher than either ACE or NEP (n = 10) ACE2, ACE2 and NEP activity were significantly higher in BBM fractions (n = 5) there were no significant differences between BMX and control animals for the individual peptides. ANG II was the predominant peptide in the ChP4 of both groups. ANG-(1\u20137) exhibited the highest concentration of the three peptides. the CSF content of ANG-(1\u20137) was significantly lower in BMX sheep compared with the vehicle-treated group. the rate of metabolism of 125I-labeled ANG-(1\u20137) to 125I-labeled ANG-(1\u20134) appeared to plateau with increasing concentrations of unlabeled ANG-(1\u20137) in control CSF. ANG II does not compete for the PCMB-sensitive peptidase to metabolize ANG-(1\u20137) over this concentration range. chromatographs of ANG-(1\u20137) metabolism with no inhibitors, PCMB alone, or PCMB and LIS were terminated at 30, 60, or 120 min. BMX animals have significantly more metabolism at the 120-min time point. the relative activities of ACE, ACE2 and NEP were localized to the brush-border fraction of the ChP4. ACE2 activity was the predominant peptidase activity in this compartment. ANG II, ANG-(1\u20137), or ANG I content were significantly higher in BMX animals. systemic d-Ala increased MAP and lowered BRS only in control sheep at 6 wk, 6 mo, and 1.8 years of age (41). it now accepted that the functional actions of the ANG-(1\u20137)-ACE-Mas receptor axis of the RAS counteract or antagonize the actions of the ANG II-ACE-AT1 receptor pathway. nephrectomized sheep plasma showed a 60-kDa band at 50 kDa. renin is the precursor to renin, in which a 43-amino acid prosegment blocks the active site of renin. prorenin is 10-fold higher than renin (38, 47) renin activity and (pro)renin receptor expression in the ChP of control and BMX animals will be measured to determine the role of fetal programming on central renin activity. ACE2 activity was 3.5-fold higher than ACE and 2.4-fold higher than NEP. ANG-(1\u20137) to form ANG-(1\u20135) was mediated by ACE. a PCMB-sensitive peptidase was the major activity that metabolized ANG-(1\u20137) to ANG-(1\u20134). the peptide contents in the ChP4 tissue and CSF were similar between BMX and control animals. d-Ala given icv reduced BRS in normotensive Wistar rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats. a decrease in the peptide could contribute to alterations in pressure and BRS in BM-exposed sheep. a decrease in the peptide could contribute to alterations in pressure and BRS in BM-exposed sheep. ACE sheddase is very similar to -secretase, a sheddase that cleaves the amyloid precursor protein involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. -secretase is present in the CSF of both healthy individuals and patients with Alzheimer's disease (49), suggesting that a similar sheddase that cleaves ACE may also be present in the CSF. this is the first report of a thiol-peptidase involved in the metabolism of ANG-(1\u20137) in sheep CSF or other tissue compartments in the sheep. we previously reported that NEP cleaved the Tyr4-Ile5 bond of ANG-(1\u20137) in the BBM fraction from rat kidney (3). however, NEP is a metallopeptidase that is insensitive to thiol inhibitors such as PCMB. dysregulation of RAS components in epithelial elements of both brain and kidney resulting from fetal programming events represents at least one target contributing to the observed cardiovascular and autonomic dysfunction. however, epigenetic modifications play an important role in initiating the long-term programming effects.
