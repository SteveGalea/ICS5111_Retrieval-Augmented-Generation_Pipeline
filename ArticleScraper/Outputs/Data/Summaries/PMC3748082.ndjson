eukaryotic viruses, phages, bacteria, and eukaryotes based on the taxonomic origin of the best-hit sequence using MEGAN 4.40 [29], [30]. a diagnostic ferret coronavirus real time RT-PCR was used. a diagnostic ferret coronavirus real time RT-PCR was used. a diagnostic ferret coronavirus real time RT-PCR was used. the similarity between different picornaviruses was measured using Simplot version 3.5.1 with the Kimura-2 parameter. transition/transversion ratio of 3.0 and window and step sizes of 600 and 20 nucleotides respectively. genomes of identified viruses were deposited in GenBank under the following accession numbers. chicken anemia virus, chicken astrovirus, chicken parvovirus, turkey hepatitis virus, fowl adenovirus, and turkey parvovirus. avian viruses may originate from the ferrets'diet (they were fed chicken) and do not represent genuine enteric infections in the ferrets. ferret viruses with homology to torque teno virus (family Anelloviridae), picobirnavirus (family Picobirnaviridae), kobu- and parechovirus (family Picornaviridae) and papillomavirus (family Papillomaviridae) were identified. ferret kobuvirus encodes a 2,482-amino-acid polyprotein flanked on each side by untranslated regions (UTRs) cleavage sites were predicted by NetPicoRNA analysis and by alignment with known cleavage sites in aichiviruses. ferret kobuvirus (red), porcine kobuvirus (GU292559, green), and human aichivirus (FJ890523; blue) polyprotein-coding nucleotide sequences were scaled to the genome diagram in A. phylogenetic trees of the amino acid sequences of ferret kobuvirus (MpKoV32, 38, and 39) with other aichiviruses in the P1 (C ferret kobuvirus 38 (MpKoV38; KF006985) and bovine kobuvirus (BKoV; AB084788), human aichivirus (AIV; FJ890523), porcine kobuvirus (PKoV; GU292559). a ferret kobuvirus-specific real time PCR targeting the 3D/3\u2032NTR region of the kobuvirus genome was performed the genus is composed of two species, human parechovirus and Ljungan virus from bank voles. the genome encodes a single stranded positive sense RNA genome of 7.5 kb. the genome encodes a single polyprotein that is cleaved by virus-encoded proteases into the structural and nonstructural proteins. virus genome organization shares less than 43% identity on the amino acid level in the entire polyprotein compared to human parechoviruses and Ljungan virus. phylogenetic analysis of ferret parechovirus showed amino acid positions of predicted cleavage sites in the polyprotein (numbering based on the ferret parechovirus polyprotein sequence) papillomaviruses are a highly diverse family of viruses with double stranded circular DNA genomes of 8 kb in size. some papillomaviruses cause benign or malignant epithelial tumors of the skin and mucous membranes. a papillomavirus strain is a new type if the complete genome has been sequenced. the L1 ORF shares less than 90% homology with the closest known papillomavirus type. most papillomavirus types within a genus share more than 60% nucleotide identity in L1. a p-distance calculated with MEGA5 [32] showed that the partial ORF1 nucleotide sequence of anellovirus MpfTTV1 was >56% divergent on the nucleotide level from anelloviruses identified in wildlife. a phylogenetic tree of the partial ORF1 nucleotide alignments was generated using the partial ORF1 nucleotide alignments. ide sequence of ferret torque teno virus (MpfTTV1) and corresponding region of representative human and animal anelloviruses was generated using MEGA5. the neighbor-joining method with p-distance and 1,000 bootstrap replicates was generated. the presence of corona- and hepeviruses was confirmed by real time PCR assays. ferret viruses with homology to torque teno virus (family Anelloviridae), picobirnavirus (family Picobirnaviridae), kobu- and parechovirus (family Picornaviridae) and papillomavirus (family Papillomaviridae) were identified. the genome encodes a single polyprotein that is cleaved by virus-encoded proteases into the structural and nonstructural proteins. a near-complete kobuvirus genome was obtained by 454-sequencing from a rectal swab from ferret 38. two partial polyprotein sequences were obtained from rectal swabs of household ferrets 32 and 39. dicted genome organization of ferret kobuvirus showing amino acid positions of predicted cleavage sites in the polyprotein. sites were predicted by NetPicoRNA analysis and by alignment with known cleavage sites in aichiviruses. et kobuvirus from bovine and ovine kobuviruses was consistently greater than that observed within different isolates of human aichiviruses or different ferret kobuviruses. no evidence of genetic recombination among ferret kobuviruses was observed. ferret parechovirus Parechovirus is a viral genus in the family Picornaviridae. the genus is composed of two species, human parechovirus and Ljungan virus from bank voles. the genome encodes a single polyprotein that is cleaved by virus-encoded proteases into the structural and nonstructural proteins. members of a picornavirus genus should normally share phylogenetically related P1, P2 and P3 genome regions. each sharing >40%, >40% and >50% amino acid identity, respectively. jungan P1 MpPeV1 40.1 40.3 43.1 HPeV1 79.3 50.5 HPeV2 50.4 P2 MpPeV1 40.6 40.1 46.2 HPeV1 94.9 47.7 HPeV2 48.8 P3 MpPeV1 37.5 37.5 40.0 HPeV1 93.6 46.3 HPeV1 (JX575746), HPeV2 (AF055846), Ljungan (NC_00 the most closely related papillomavirus to MpPV1 was canine papillomavirus 2 (60% identity) from the genus Taupapillomavirus. papillomaviruses are classified based on nucleotide sequence identity in the L1 ORF and their biological and pathological properties. a phylogenetic tree of the L1 genome region of ferret papillomavirus (MpPV1) and representative human and animal papillomaviruses was generated using MEGA5, with the maximum-likelihood method with Kimura-2 parameter and 1,000 bootstrap replicates. no samples were positive for MpPV1 (Table 1). torque teno virus species identified in ferrets belongs to genus Xitorquevirus. phylogenetic tree of the partial ORF1 nucleotide sequence of ferret torque teno virus (MpfTTV1) was generated using MEGA5, with the neighbor-joining method with p-distance and 1,000 bootstrap replicates. amplification and next-generation sequencing and a specific ferret hepatitis E virus taqman assay indicated that household ferrets that are kept as pets are significantly more likely to excrete ferret hepatitis E virus in their fecal material than farm animals. the correlation was not observed for ferret coronavirus excretion for which prevalence in both cohorts seemed similar, but not as high as previously reported. the ferret parechovirus is the third parechovirus species identified to date. it is highly divergent from human parechovirus and Ljungan virus. only 1 out of 39 ferrets was positive for MpPeV1, suggesting that the ferret parechovirus prevalence may be relatively low. ferret anellovirus MpfTTV1 is most closely related to the recently identified anellovirus from pine marten. a closely related virus to MpfTTV1 seemed to be present in one other ferret (Table 1) besides ferret 21, resulting in a virus prevalence of 5% in this study. ferrets are carnivores that are significantly affected by a number of human. the characterization of the fecal virome of ferrets provides epidemiological baseline information about pathogens. this allows the swift identification of possible sources of future zoonotic infections and their subsequent control. ferrets can be infected with a wide range of different viruses."}
