{"summary": "rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a chronic symmetrical autoimmune disease, is characterized by synovial inflammation and proliferation accompanied by cartilage erosion and bone loss. more than one-third of patients eventually experience employment disability and lower quality of life because of this disease. mortality rates in RA patients are higher than in the healthy population. studies have shown that the levels of DKK1 in serum were significantly higher in RA patients. treatment with an anti-DKK1 antibody has attenuated bone erosion. over the last 20 years, great progress has been made in developing DNA vaccines. four B cell epitopes and designed a novel DKK1 multiepitope DNA vaccine. our data demonstrated that this DNA vaccine ameliorated bone erosion significantly in mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) the reactions were stopped by the addition of 50 L of Stop Solution (R&D Systems) and OD450 readings were measured with an ELISA plate reader. the peptides (100 g/injection, intraperitoneally) were applied for a week. transfection of Plasmid pCMV-DP into COS7 Cells were cultured in a 6-well tissue culture plate. cells reached 60% to 80% confluence and were transfected with purified plasmid DNA. the membrane was exposed to a superSignal west Pico stable peroxide solution. the protein secreted in the cell culture supernatant was detected with ELISA. 96-well plates were coated with a goat anti-human DKK1 antibody. the sections were incubated with a goat anti-human anti-human antibody. the next day, the sections were incubated with a donkey anti-goat IgG. positive signals were detected with 3, 3\u2032 diaminobenzidine (DAB, R&D Systems) the plates were blocked with 200 L of 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBST for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. after washing, 100 L of diluted serum (1 : 200) was added to each well. the plates were incubated for 2 h at 37\u00b0C and washed five times with PBST. each limb was graded independently, resulting in a maximum clinical score of 16 per affected animal. X-ray images were analyzed using the software SPSS (version 16.0) and presented as the mean SEM. 96-well plates were coated with peptides (1 g/mL) overnight at 4\u00b0C. peptides were added to wells and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. plasmid pCMV-DP was incorporated into the expression vector pCMV6-XL5 using an endotoxin-free plasmid extraction kit. the cells were transfected with the purified plasmid DNA using TurboFect in vitro Transfection Reagent. mL was diluted in 390 L of serum-free DMEM. 400 L of the mixture was distributed dropwise into cultured COS7 cells in a 6-well plate. transfected cells were cultured for 72 h. the cell culture supernatant (200 L) was added to the wells and was incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. 100 L of a working dilution of Streptavidin-HRP was added to each well. the reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 L of 2 M H2SO4. LB/c mice (n = 6) were injected intramuscularly (i.m.) with plasmid pCMV-DP three times at weeks 0, 2, and 4. intramuscular injection of plasmid DNA followed by electroporation (DNA + EP) was performed as previously described. mice (n = 6) were immunized with plasmid pCMV-DP three times at 2-week intervals. mice were given a booster injection with 100 g of bovine C II dissolved in incomplete Freud's adjuvant (IFA) containing 4 mg/mL of heat-killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis. each animal was graded independently, resulting in a maximum clinical score of 16 per affected animal. X-ray images were analyzed by reconstructed 3D quantitative analyses using the software VGstudio MAX 2.0. X-ray images were analyzed by reconstructed 3D quantitative analyses using the software VGstudio MAX 2.0. the recombinant amino acid sequence of human DKK1 DNA vaccine was evaluated in COS7 cells. the multiepitope DNA vaccine recombinant protein of DKK1 was secretly recognized by its polyclonal antibodies. recombinant protein in the DNA vaccine was much higher in the muscles at the injected site than in the control group. expression of the multiepitope gene in vitro and in vivo was determined in cell culture supernatants by ELISA, cell lysates by Western blotting and the muscles of mice. the disease incidence was 83% in prevaccinated mice and 100% in the positive control mice on day 39. the infiltration of inflammatory cells was reduced in the vaccine-immunized mice compared with the controls. a panel of twelve peptides fragments was synthesized. to select the high affinity and immunogenicity of synthesis peptides, the titers of peptides were determined. the peptides of grey-blue columns were candidates to design DNA vaccine. expression of the multiepitope DNA vaccine in vitro was evaluated in COS7 cells. the multiepitope gene was expressed in eukaryotes both in vitro and in vivo. expression of recombinant protein was much higher in the muscles at the injected site than in the control group. the serum IgG titer began to increase as early as 4 weeks after the primary immunization and reached its peak at 6 weeks. the end-point titer of anti-DKK1 was only 1 : 1600. the specific antibody existed persistently in the serum up to 6 months after immunization. the results of micro-CT scanning and TB staining showed that the DNA vaccine attenuated bone erosion in CIA mice. the greatest advantage of DNA vaccines is their ability to elicit humoral immunity and cellular immunity. to increase the titer of specific antibodies, we combined the predictions of the software DNASTAR 7.1 and the affinity and immunogenicity assays. to reduce their potential bone resorption of natural DKK1, the synthesis epitopes were injected to BALB/c and no significant osteoclastogenesis was observed. plasmid DNA was blocked by perimysia of the skeletal muscles. less than 1% of the plasmid DNA entered the nucleus. electroporation has been used for DNA vaccine delivery. the four selected epitopes were separated from one another with AAY spacers. the full-length protein was more easily processed and presented in vivo. the pan DR T helper epitope (PADRE) was added to enhance antibody responses. es and other antigen-presenting cells, infiltrated the injected muscles, enhanced the efficiency of antigen presentation. the highly specific IgG antibodies in serum were induced as early as 4 weeks, which also demonstrated the efficiency of the electroporation of the DNA vaccine."}
