{"summary": "two of the largest hospitals in Singapore report that one in seven hospitalized patients acquire a nosocomial infection. on average, one in seven hospitalized patients acquire a nosocomial infection,1 with immunocompromised children at greatest risk. little is known regarding the transmission of respiratory viruses in clinical environments. each sampler separates collected particles into three aerodynamic diameters. nucleic acid extraction PTFE filters were removed from cassettes attached to the samplers. one mL of 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) fraction V was then added to each 50mL falcon tube and vortexed again for 15 s. Extracted DNA was tested for adenovirus by realtime PCR. 500 L of sample was inoculated into adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cells. after 72 hours, inoculated shell vials were observed for cytopathic effect. the NIOSH samplers were stationed on tripods and placed along the corridor outside the open patient bedding area. one SKC filter cassette was attached to a mobile computer on wheels (COW) used by doctors and nurses during ward rounds. each sampler was connected to an AirChekR TOUCH Sample Pump (SKC, Eighty- Four, USA) for air collection at a rate of 3.5 L/min. swabbed filters from SKC cassettes were soaked in 0.5% BSA fraction V solution. swabs were then placed in 50mL falcon tubes, vortexed for 15 s, and transferred to cryovials. QIAamp viral RNA kit and QIAamp DNA Blood kit (Qiagen) were then used to extract RNA and DNA. eight of the 28 aerosol samples tested positive for adenovirus and one tested positive for influenza A virus. none of the samples tested positive for influenza B or D virus, enterovirus or coronavirus.
