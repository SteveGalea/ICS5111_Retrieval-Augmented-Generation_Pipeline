{"summary": "RIG-I (Retinoic acid-inducible gene I) encoded by the DDX58 gene in the human genome (1, 2) and MDA5 (Melanoma Differentiation-Associated protein 5) encoded by the IFIH1 gene (3, 4) are known as important protein initiators of earliest immune responses to viral infection. however, it is becoming increasingly clear that there are unique differences between RIG-I and MDA5. the activated RIG-I and MDA5 interact with the mitochondrial antiviral signaling proteins (MAVS), which forms a multilayered protein complex contain several different proteins (6\u20139). the MAVS complex catalyzes the interaction of inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit epsilon (IKK) and the serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (TBK1) (10\u201312), which phosphorylate the DA5 signaling pathway activated by recognition of PAMP dsRNA. phosphorylation of the transcription factors IRF3 and p-IRF7 ensures to translocate the phosphorylated p-IRF3 and p-IRF7 into the nucleus. expression and exportation of these genes into the cellular milieu trigger the IFN1 signaling cascade in an autocrine or paracrine fashion. RIG-I and MDA5 may also play a role in recognizing non-viral pathogens. the presence of either in combination with toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) is critical to have effective anti-viral repsonses (32). each serves an additive role during west Nile virus infection (33), which is likely mediated by the production of multiple PAMP species in the infected cells. IG-I and MDA5 have distinct autoimmune presentations, with RIG-I mutations being associated with atypical Singleton-Merten syndrome. MDA5 mutations have been linked to classical Singleton-Merten syndrome, Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res syndrome, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, type 1 diabetes and Graves disease (43, 44) RIG-I (but not MDA5) also induces inflammasome assembly-mediated cleavage and maturation of pro- IL-1 by caspase 1 (24, 34, 53) also induces inflammasome assembly-mediated cleavage and maturation of pro- IL-1 by caspase 1 (24, 34, 53) the structure of the ATP binding site distinguishes RIG-I and MDA5 from other helicase proteins, such as Dicer. the ATP binding site in RIG-I and MDA5 remains comparatively open and structurally dynamic following RNA binding. each protein also contains a positively charged groove within this domain that recognizes dsRNA. RIG-I primarily recognizes short double-stranded RNA with 5\u2032 triphosphate groups (67\u201375), while MDA5 primarily recognizes long double-stranded RNA (76\u201379) the motifs adopt different orientations relative to dsRNA in RIG-I and MDA5. I unfolds into an open and activated state that is mediated by the flexible hinge regions between the CARD domains and the helicase domain. there is evidence to suggest that MDA5 has a more dynamic structure (99) unlike a model of RIG-I activation described above, it is possible that MDA5 may be inhibited in the absence of the dsRNA ligand by its structural dynamics. ubiquitin ligase Riplet attaches ubiquitin peptides onto the C terminal domain of RIG-I at residues K849 and K851. in-situ studies found that dsRNA was sufficient to weaken the interaction between purified RIG-I C terminal domain and RIG-I CARD domains. this domain is polyubiquinated at K172 by the E3 TRIM25 ubiquitin ligase (104 the question remains whether Riplet can ubiquitinate other lysine residues in the absence of TRIM25. in-situ experiments compared RIG-I ubiquitination by Riplet and TRIM25 used an E2 enzyme (103) that had been found to be specific for Riplet. TRIM25 has been found to be essential for RIG-I activation and IFN signaling in-vitro and in-vivo. s from TRIM25 KO mice have significantly downregulated IFN1 production upon viral infection (113) KO mice for NLRP12 show increased interferon production and more resistance to viral infection (117). it is clear that both Riplet and TRIM25 can mediate K63-linked polyubiquitination. it has also been found that in-situ incubation of purified RIG-I CARD domains with ubiquitin can be activated by free and un independent studies have found that MDA5 is (125, 126) or is not (126) K63 polyubiquitinated. TRIM25 does not affect ubiquitination of MDA5 (without distinguishing between K63 and K48 polyubiquitination) and for TRIM25 to increase K63 ubiquitination (125) the minimum length of dsRNA found to activate RIG-I is 13 base pairs. this is equivalent to the minimum length to facilitate the formation of a 2-RIG-I/dsRNA dimer (75) shorter (5 bp) stem loop dsRNA complexes can also activate IFN signaling in cells (135, 136) and in mice (136). the formation of longer filaments by RIG-I has been more controversial. it is significantly shorter than the length of dsRNA that activates MDA5, which forms filaments on 2,000 bp dsRNA (137). I and MDA5 interacting with dsRNA may explain decrease in dsRNA length efficiency to activate RIG-I as compared to MDA5. RIG-I seems to recognize the 5\u2032ppp end before sliding down the length of the dsRNA (144), whereas MDA5 dynamically associates and disassociates along the length of long dsRNA (137). however, it is still unclear whether RIG-I can preferentially be activated by longer d ARD domains on the outside of the tetramer and the RIG-I CARD1 (1\u201387) domain facing toward the center of the tetramer (63) dephosphorylation of T170 is largely buried within the CARD2 domain in a section that would be in closer contact with the helicase domains. dephosphorylation of T170 affects an interaction domain between CARD2 and the C terminus (151) the activated p-IRF3 (15) and p-IRF7 (14) then translocate into the nucleus and dimerize. they then act as the primary transcription factors for IFN and IFN. there is also a distinction between innate immune cell types for IFN1 production. RIG-I has the highest affinity for short dsRNA that is tri-phosphorylated at the 5\u2032 end (67\u201375) a single unpaired 5\u2032 tri-phosphorylated nucleotide is sufficient to competitively inhibit RIG-I. a single unpaired 5\u2032 tri-phosphorylated nucleotide is sufficient to competitively inhibit RIG-I. features of the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 dsRNA ends for RIG-I activation have proven to be complex. a 5\u2032 diphosphate group is the minimum feature required for RIG-I binding and activation. a 5\u2032 diphosphate group is the minimum feature required for RIG-I binding and activation. a possible explanation for the discrepancy between the studies was that higher order RNA structures might compensate for the less optimal 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends. monophosphate dsRNA that did not contain stem-loop structures did not activate RIG-I and RNA regions repetitive in certain nucleotides were found to be critical for RIG-I activation. uridine-rich 5\u2032 tri-phosphorylated hairpin RNA (190), synthetic AU- rich hairpins (191) and those naturally found in the genomes of Sendai virus defective-interfering (DI) particles (192), measles (193), Influenza A virus (IAV) (194) and in KSHV RNA transcripts (195), poly (U/UC) regions (196) and poly (A/AG) regions (197) in the antisense Hepatitis C some DVG RNAs have been noted to have \u201ccopy-back\u201d motifs in which one end of the genome can base pair with an inverted copy at the opposite end of the genome. this may be due to stalled and aberrant replication (202, 203) the extent of MDA5 interacting with DI RNA is currently unknown. it appears to be more predominantly activated by DVG RNA than RIG-I specifically in dendritic cells early in the viral infection cycle (211) the comparative abilities for DI particles vs. infectious virions to activate RIG-I and MDA5 have important implications for understanding viral pathogenesis. the preference for specific RNA species by RIG-I and MDA5 allows for them to distinguish between viral RNA and host RNA in most circumstances (225) studies from clinical cases of MDA5 mutations provide contradictory models, with certain mutations found in Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res syndrome (AGS) increasing MDA5 avidity for self RNA (226) mutations E373A and C268F found in the RIG-I protein in patients with auto-immune disorder Singleton-Merten syndrome confer the ability of the protein to recognize Cap1 RNA and become activated by ATP dependent and independent mechanisms. also, the E373Q mutation of RIG-I was found to increase the affinity of RIG-I with ribosomal RNA (233) e activity may also be sufficient to potentiate RIG-I and MDA5. RNA-DNA hybrids are able to bind RIG-I and activate ATPase activity, but don't induce IFN expression. it is currently undetermined whether such hybrids can sterically inhibit RIG-I due to the presence of mostly dNTPs. overhang RNA (144, 170) found in miRNA (240) as well as other RNA motifs. an impaired ATPase functionality increases the promiscuity of RIG-I binding these host RNA motifs (144, 176, 242) circRNAs in eukaryotic cells were first thought to be byproducts of the pre-mRNA splicing process. however, they have later been found to be produced by a non-canonical \u201cbacksplicing\u201d process. there is increasing evidence to suggest that they play some important regulatory roles. direct exposure of cells to type 1 and 3 interferons increases expression of the cellular long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), namely lncATV. increased serum selenoprotein level has been found to significantly associate with treatment failure of anti-viral drugs in HCV patients. cellular RNA has also been found to activate RLR signaling during viral infection. Knockdown of RNA5SP141 decreased cytokine signaling during infection with HSV and EBV as well as influenza A virus (IAV) (251) mitochondrial dsRNA degrading enzymes were able to activate MDA5 (253) extracellular vesicles were found to contain long interspersed nuclear element (LINE) and short interspersed nuclear element (SINE) RNAs that are products of RNA polymerase III. there are many mechanisms viruses have evolved to evade RIG-I and MDA5 signaling. such mechanisms are of particular importance to segmented RNA viruses, providing potentially more dsRNAs for RIG-I and MDA5 activation. viral infection has the capability to disrupt processes of the cell's basic functions, such as transcription and translation. viral infection has the capability to disrupt processes of the cell's basic functions, such as transcription and translation, thereby affecting viral replication and immune signaling in complicated ways (258). the US11 protein of HSV1 (282) and the arenaviral Z matrix proteins (274) directly interact with and inhibit RIG-I and MDA5 in a similar fashion. there are also many other viral proteins that can regulate proteins in the RIG-I and MDA5 pathways. host proteins and viral proteins that modulate RIG-I and MDA5 signaling are shown. ubiquitination at other lysine residues in RIG-I besides K172 induces proteasomal degradation (291\u2013293) this proteasomal degradation may be mediated by a p62 autophagic complex that associates with LRRC25/ISG15 (294) and SQSTM1 (295) and also mediates mitophagy and downregulation of MAVS signaling during measles virus infection (296) the NS1 protein of west Nile virus targets both RIG-I and MDA5 for degradation by proteasomes. NS1 inhibited K63 ubiquitination of RIG-I, but MDA5 was not found to be K63 ubiquitinated (126) heat shock protein 90-alpha (HSP90) has been found to protect RIG-I from proteasomal degradation. the human hemoglobin subunit beta (HB) has recently been suggested to decrease MDA5 signaling by competing for long dsRNA. the zinc-finger protein ZCCHC3 has recently been found do so for both RIG-I and MDA5 in similar mechanisms to the other known RNA-binding proteins. cellular proteins such as NLRC5 (330) have been shown to block interaction of both RIG-I and MDA5 with MAVS. DHX15 has been identified as a RIG-I cofactor that interacts with the RIG-I CARD domains and with PAMP (dsRNA), thereby increasing RIG-I ATPase activity. the evolutionary tract of RIG-I, MDA5, and related DExD/H-box helicases are shown as a phylogenetic tree, along with their lowest level of biological taxonomy that these proteins are found in present day. the precursor of the MDA5 helicase-CTD likely originated from a common ancestor with the precursor for LGP2. analysis has shown that the helicase-DExD/H and CARD2 have strong co-evolution history (347, 348), while CARD1 has evolved more independently (184). positive selection can be seen in the flexible hinge region connecting the CARD domains to the helicase in RIG-I and MDA5. RLR-like proteins in prokaryotes do not have CARD domains and the PRRs in plants found so far are surface-receptor kinases that respond to external molecular elements of bacteria. RNA silencing has been demonstrated to be an important anti-viral strategy in plants. the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) has been found to express a LGP2 variant in addition to the canonical LGP2 that contains an incomplete C-terminal domain of RIG-I (376) a mutation in the IAV polymerase subunit PB2 found in avian-adapted strains decreases the inhibition of human RIG-I function by IAV nucleoproteins. logs are found on the X and Y chromosomes, they may contribute to immunological differences between genders (381). DHX9 (382), DHX15 (383), and a complex consisting of DDX1/DDX21/DHX36 (384) have also been found to associate with the MAVS complex to enhance IFN1 signaling. DDX proteins can also activate other proteins in the IRF pathway. an immediate step is to determine the functions of some critical proteins, such as the RIG-I and MDA5 of the innate immune arm. examining their structural and functional similarities and differences at multiple levels will allow for a deeper level of appreciation of these proteins."}
