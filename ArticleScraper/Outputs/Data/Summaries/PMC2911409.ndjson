{"summary": "study examined coping patterns, coping flexibility, and depressive symptoms. results A total of 266 participants both completed the entire questionnaires. depressive symptoms were significantly associated with higher levels of event frequency and event impact. effective coping is achieved only if the appropriate coping style is used. positive emotion can occur even when depression and distress are frequent. a failure of effective coping with stress may lead to psychological problems. depressive participants with higher educational qualifications exhibited lower levels of coping flexibility. active-inflexible coping was the dominant strategy employed by Chinese university students perceiving most situations as controllable. study aimed to explore prevalence of depressed mood among undergraduate students. the mean age of participants was 18.49 years (SD = 0.789) and participants, on average, had completed 12.27 years (SD = 0.712) of education. participants received $10 RMB in return for completing questionnaires. the BDI is a 21-item, self-report questionnaire that assesses depressive symptoms experienced in the past two weeks. scores range from 0 to 63, with higher scores indicating higher levels of depressive symptoms. the BDI has been found to exhibit high levels of reliability and validity [20] in mainland China. participants, 56 (30 men and 26 women) were classified as depressed (MEAN BDI = 20.03; SD = 6.80) and 210 (177 men and 93 women) as non-depressed (MEAN BDI = 1.67; SD = 1.50) in order to match demographic data, 56 participants were randomly selected for subsequent data analysis. current study was approved by the ethics committee of the institute of psychology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. participants were given a general introduction to the study as well as the opportunity to ask questions about the study. written consent was obtained prior to the administration of questionnaires. the BDI has been found to exhibit high levels of reliability and validity [20] in mainland China [22,23] Procedure The current study was approved by the ethics committee of the Institute of Psychology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. lower levels of perceived controllability (r = -.261, p.001), coping effectiveness (r = -.375, p.001), and ratio of strategy to situation fit (r = -.108, p.05) were not significantly associated with cognitive flexibility (variance of perceived controllability; r =.031, p =.527). the results of a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) revealed a significant effect of group status on all variables (F(18, 91) = 13.777, p 0.001) neither gender (p = 0.249) nor the interaction between gender and depressive symptoms (p = 0.348) exhibited significant effects. there were no significant group differences in the use of emotion focused strategies in either controllable (p = 0.369) or uncontrollable (p = 0.268) situations. no significant group differences in the use of emotion focused strategies in either controllable (p = 0.369) or uncontrollable (p = 0.268) situations. the depressed and non-depressed groups significantly differed from one another on multiple subscales of the CFQ (i.e., event frequency, event impact, perceived controllability, and ratio of strategy-situation fit) each subscale exhibited a unique effect in predicting group status. perceived controllability failed to exhibit a unique effect. depressive symptoms were significantly associated with higher levels of event frequency (r =.368, p.001) and event impact (r =.245, p.001) and lower levels of perceived controllability (r = -.261, p.001), coping effectiveness (r = -.375, p.001), and ratio of strategy to situation fit (r = -.108, p.05) 61*** -.168*** -.246*** - 5.
