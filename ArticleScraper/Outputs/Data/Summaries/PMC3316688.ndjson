{"summary": "the four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV1\u20134) are responsible for approximately 50 to 100 million infections annually, and 2.5 billion people are at risk of infection. most symptomatic DENV infections present as a debilitating, febrile disease known as dengue fever (DF), but serious cases can progress to dengue hemorrhagic fever (DF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) these can be fatal if patients do not receive fluid replacement. IFITM proteins are relatively small (130 amino acids) and share a common topology. in humans, IFITM1, 2, and 3 are expressed in a wide range of tissues. in humans, IFITM1, 2, and 3 are expressed in a wide range of tissues. IFITM-mediated restriction can be bypassed by inducing viral fusion at the plasma membrane, suggesting that the site or mechanism of viral entry can affect the sensitivity to IFITM-mediated restriction. previous studies of IFITM-mediated restriction of flaviviruses used cell lines lacking Fc receptors [8], [11], [12]. IFITM proteins restrict both direct and ADE-mediated DENV infection of K562 cells. K562 cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of human interferon- or mock treated, and lysed for Western blot analysis 48 h later. stably transduced cells were infected with infectious deNV2 NGC strain. pQCXIP was incubated for 2 days before harvesting for flow cytometry. anti-prM antibodies opsonize virions that are not fully mature. anti-prM antibodies opsonize most virions. intracellular staining of deNV antigen less than 43 h post-infection indicates a single round of infection. we stably transduced K562 cells to express previously characterized shRNAs against IFITM1, 2, or 3 [8], [9], or with a control non-targeting shRNA (scrambled) we subsequently investigated whether endogenous IFITM proteins contributed to DENV restriction. shRNA-transduced K562 cells characterized in panel A were infected with the indicated pseudoviruses as described in Fig. 1C. Error bars indicate standard error. single and double asterisks indicate statistically significant differences. different MOIs were used to achieve comparable infection levels between direct and ADE-mediated infection. different MOIs were used to achieve comparable infection levels between direct and ADE-mediated infection. differences between direct infection and ADE-mediated infection were not statistically significant. the mechanisms of IFITM-mediated restriction remain elusive. we have previously demonstrated that IFITM proteins do not interfere with virion access to acidic cellular compartments. inducing viral fusion at the plasma membrane bypasses IFITM-mediated restriction. Western blots Cells were lysed with 1% NP-40 (Thermo Scientific) and Western blot analysis was performed as previously described. endogenous IFITM protein expression was detected by rabbit anti-IFITM1 (FL-125, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) entry proteins, plasmids and procedures for generating pseudotyped MLV-EGFP have been described. 2105 cells were seeded overnight in 12-well plates and infected with a similar total volume (500 l) of virus or virus-antibody complex in DMEM containing 2% FBS the next day. the dilution that gave the best enhancement in infection was subsequently used in all experiments. human myelogenous leukemia K562 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium. media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 g/ml streptomycin. plasmids encoding control shRNA or shRNA targeting IFITMs in pRS vector have been described. entry proteins used are IAV HA proteins from A/Thailand/2(SP-33)/2004(H5N1) and glycoprotein (GP) from Machupo virus Carvallo. transduction of K562 or J774A.1 cells and MLV-EGFP pseudovirus infection procedures have been described [9] the infection protocol was slightly modified for adherent J774A.1 cells. 2105 cells were seeded overnight in 12-well plates and infected with a similar total volume (500 l) of virus or virus-antibody complex."}
