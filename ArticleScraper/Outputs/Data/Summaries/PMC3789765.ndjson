{"summary": "pathogenic agents are known to be causally related to 20% of human cancer cases [1] and significantly affect the global health burden of this disease [2]. the majority of these agents comprise oncogenic viruses such as human papilloma virus (HPV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) [3]. Consequently, viral cofactors for several idiopathic cancers are currently investigated the early onset of the disease overlaps with periods of high susceptibility to viral infections. epidemiological studies have associated reduced neuroblastoma risk with immunologic indicators such as previous childhood infections, day care attendance, and breast feeding [20] that are suggestive of an infective cofactor [21]. -virus associations based on negative evidence and aided in the identification of MCPyV, a human polyomavirus, as a cofactor of Merkel cell carcinoma [31]. however, the large numbers of sequence fragments generated by these methods necessitate data reduction approaches for filtering and condensing the list of putative viral transcripts. digital transcript subtraction that discards human sequence homologs from the sequence data. the approach is configured to allow for high mismatch rates and mappings to multiple reference sequences (\u2018multimaps\u2019) Virana exploits multimaps to assign sequence reads to a homologous context comprising human reference transcripts and viral reference genomes. these homologous regions retain the full, unfiltered information contained in the raw sequence data. all patients were enrolled in the German Neuroblastoma trials with informed consent. an EBV-positive B-cell-lymphoma (BCL) was received from the pediatric oncology and Hematology Department of the Hannover Medical School. all libraries had insert size distributions approximating bp, bp as later confirmed by read mapping. the data were filtered according to signal purity by the Illumina Realtime Analysis software. simulated sequencing data from three viral genomes homologous to human factors. the NB1 panel contains seven transcriptomes of neuroblastoma stages 4 and 4S each. the NB2 panel contains one sample of stages 4 and 4S each. positive control panels of human cancer transcriptomes with known viral cofactors are denoted as POS. a set of all available viral reference genomes and their taxonomic lineages were obtained from UCSC via the E-utilities web service. all available complete viral reference genomes were combined into a single human-viral reference database for Virana. all data were mapped against a combined human-viral reference database with the splicing-aware and gapped read mapper STAR [59] in paired-end mode. all data were mapped against a combined human-viral reference database with the splicing-aware and gapped read mapper STAR [59] in paired-end mode. STAR supports detection of putative new viral transcripts. the read mapper employed in our study is able to partially align reads that contain a human-viral chimeric breakpoint to multiple reference sequences. resulting partially aligned reads can be detected by Virana within the generic analysis of homologous regions. the second, more sensitive approach to detecting chimeric transcripts is based on paired-end read information. pooled HITs originating from the same analysis panel are assigned to viral taxonomic families based on the viral genomic references they refer to. the same HIT may, in principle, be assigned to several HOGs. this circumstance considerably complicates interpretation of homologous relationships between multiple reads and references. sequences within each HOR are amenable to sequence alignment against the longest reference sequence within that HOR using LASTZ. sequences within each HOR are now amenable to sequence alignment against the longest reference sequence within that HOR using LASTZ. homologous groups are represented as multiple sequence alignments. taxonomic annotations and phylogenetic analyses are further enriched. basepairs then merge pair_of_homologous_regions; extend all reference aligment positions within new homologous_region; end end end end end end Consensus sequences can be further processed by phylogenetic analyses. the software PhyML [64] follows the maximum likelihood approach and using default parameters recommended by the HIV sequence database. gene annotations for high-scoring reference hits are pooled and query transcripts are assigned a putative viral, human, or ambiguous origin based on the pooled information. we constrain the allowed taxonomic origin of reference sequences to only viral (NCBI taxon ID) or human (NCBI taxon ID ) hits while excluding artificial sequences (NCBI taxon ID ). four human-viral spike-in sets are analyzed by Virana, RINS, and CaPSID using identical reference sequences. sensitivity and specificity of viral read detection are determined for each method and data set. reads from a particular viral genome may be distributed across several closely related reference genomes, all of which may be considered valid mappings. cordant read ends in order to detect the origins of chimeric transcripts were performed as described before. we quantify the theoretical sensitivity of Virana by estimating the number of viral transcripts per cell that are required for a certain minimal sequencing coverage. silico simulation of paired-end reads takes into account the distribution of insert sizes of paired-end reads. a mean estimator for and its standard error were derived by averaging the success rates of homologous region constructions across simulations for each transcript length, read length, region linkage, and read coverage. all patients were enrolled in the German Neuroblastoma trials with informed consent. an EBV-positive B-cell-lymphoma (BCL) was received from the pediatric oncology and Hematology Department of the Hannover Medical School. a negative control panel consisting of a normal brain transcriptome. the data were filtered according to signal purity by the Illumina Realtime Analysis software. reads originating from the ABL1-homologue of the Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV, GI:9626953, positions ), from the gag region of HERVK22I (obtained from Repbase [53], positions ) were generated in silico by dwgsim, a read simulator based on wgsim. the NB1 panel contains seven transcriptomes of neuroblastoma stages 4 and 4S each. the NB2 panel contains one sample of stages 4 and 4S each. positive control panels of human cancer transcriptomes with known viral cofactors are denoted as POS. UCSC build hg19, GRCh37, and refGene splice-site annotations were obtained from UCSC. a set of all available viral reference genomes and their taxonomic lineages were obtained from NCBI via the E-utilities web service. splicing-aware and gapped read mapper STAR [59] in paired-end mode. STAR supports detection of chimeric transcripts by reporting discordant read pairs whose ends map to different chromosomes. read pairs with at least one unmapped read end were extracted from BAM files. STAR mapper able to partially align reads that contain a human-viral chimeric breakpoint to multiple reference sequences. the second, more sensitive approach to detecting chimeric transcripts is based on paired-end read information. reads that map to at least one viral reference are extracted from the mapping together with their primary (highest alignment score) and secondary mapping positions. set of HITs assigned to the same viral taxonomic family are denoted as the homologous group (HOG) of that family. sequences in HOGs cannot conveniently be aligned in a multiple sequence alignment. this circumstance considerably complicates interpretation of homologous relationships between multiple reads and references. sequences within each HOR are amenable to sequence alignment against the longest reference sequence within that HOR using LASTZ. resulting star-shaped multiple sequence alignment is then used for construction of per-sample (for reads) and per-gene (for human reference transcripts) consensus sequences can then be manually inspected to determine single nucleotide permutations and indels up to length that distinguish sequence reads, viral references, and human reference transcripts. homologous groups initialise: homologous_groups; for read in mapping do obtain all mapped references of read; for viral reference the read maps to do add alignment positions of cDNA to read_hit; end for viral reference of a viral taxonomic family thus added do add read_hit to the homologous group for that family. Virana employs the software PhyML [64] following the maximum likelihood approach. we also compare consensus sequences of aligned HOGs and de-novo assembled sequence contigs to nucleotide (NCBI NT) and protein (NCBI NR) reference archives. this approach is recommended for discovering remote similarities. the allowed taxonomic origin of reference sequences is restricted to only viral (NCBI taxon ID ) or human (NCBI taxon ID ) hits while excluding artificial sequences (NCBI taxon ID ) using the NCBI database query \u201c(((txid10239 [ORGN]) OR (txid9606 [ORGN]) OR (human [ORGN])\u201d. sensitivity and specificity of viral read detection are determined for each method and data set. reads from a particular viral genome of the validation data set may be distributed across several closely related reference genomes. sensitivity and specificity of the methods change only minimally if data is analyzed on the single species level. the probability of sequencing a viral transcript fragment among the overall transcript fragments is specified by the cumulative binomial distribution function with parameters. this approach has a negligible approximation error of, where [67] silico simulation of paired-end reads that are assigned randomly independently and uniformly to transcripts of different lengths and at varying coverages. a mean estimator for and its standard error were derived by averaging the success rates of homologous region constructions across simulations for each transcript length, read length, region linkage, and read coverage. the background set is used to construct four additional validation data sets spiked with viral reads at increasing rates of sequence divergence. performance is quantified in terms of sensitivity and specificity (see Materials and Methods) the two subtractive methods achieve fold higher sensitivities compared to Virana. HERV reads are correctly classified by Virana during homologous region construction. the background set without any spike-ins of viral reads serves as negative control. the background set without any spike-ins of viral reads serves as negative control. the analysis allows for further reduction in processing time. time required for data analysis is reported for negative control without viral spike-ins. the resulting human-viral fusion transcripts mimic transcriptional signals indicating retroviral integration or homologous recombination of viral DNA next to a human gene. performance is quantified by detection sensitivity, specificity, as well as by the absolute number of reads correctly detected. only Virana detects viral transcripts at all coverages. performance is quantified in terms of sensitivity (right panel) and absolute number of reads correctly identified (left panel) methods are validated at detecting both isolated gene regions (upper part) and at detecting human-viral fusion transcripts involving each of the three gene regions fused to the human TP53 proto-oncogene (lower part) specificity of detection is 1.0 (100%) for all detection methods. a transcript length corresponding to a small viral genome ( bp) and a per-sample sequencing depth of % of the sequencing depth generated in the NB1 panel are required for reliable detection. the probability of successful region construction by Virana depends on the lengths of the viral transcript being sought, the region linkage parameter, as well as characteristics of the sequencing platform employed. negative control sequencing data originate from a normal brain transcriptome that is suitable as a control for neuroblastoma data. positive controls span a range of cancer transcriptomes that are associated with several viral cofactors such as a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell line with proviral integration of Hepatitis B virus, a cervical squamous cell carcinoma (ceSCC) and two HeLa cell line samples with associated human papillomavirus (HPV) several retroviral and flaviviral hits at low abundances of reads per million reads mapped (RPMM) highlight human factors such as HERV-Ks (endogenous retroviruses) as well as human proto-oncogenes SRC/ABL and DNAJC14/RP11 that have close homologs in the viral families Retroviridae and Flaviviridae. bp long EBV segment containing latency-associated factors EBNA 3b, 3c, and 4a. several HORs with lower abundances assigned to the taxonomic families Retroviridae and Flaviviridae represent human-viral sequence homologies that are automatically flagged to be of ambiguous taxonomic status by Virana.

Virana exhibits a slightly lowered specificity compared to subtractive approaches. the majority of time spent by CaPSID is lost on subtraction. we note that the majority of time spent by CaPSID is lost on subtraction. time required for data analysis. time in minutes required for analysis. simulated sequencing reads are sampled directly from human-viral homologs. in the second scenario reads are generated from artificial fusion transcripts. the resulting human-viral fusion transcripts mimic transcriptional signals indicating retroviral integration or homologous recombination of viral DNA next to a human gene. performance is quantified in terms of sensitivity and absolute number of reads correctly identified. Methods are validated at detecting both isolated gene regions (upper part) and at detecting human-viral fusion transcripts involving each of the three gene regions fused to the human TP53 proto-oncogene (lower part) Virana requires a minimum twofold sequence coverage of an average viral cDNA transcript in order to detect the transcript within a homologous region with % probability. the number of viral transcripts per cell required for detection is inversely related to transcript length and sequencing depth. at a transcript length corresponding to a small viral genome ( bp) and a per-sample sequencing depth of % of the sequencing depth generated in the NB1 panel, a transcript coverage of and at least negative control sequencing data originate from a normal brain transcriptome that is suitable as a control for neuroblastoma data. negative control sequencing data originate from a normal brain transcriptome that is suitable as a control for neuroblastoma data. several retroviral and flaviviral hits at low abundances of reads per million reads mapped (RPMM) highlight human factors such as HERV-Ks (endogenous retroviruses) as well as human proto-oncogenes SRC/ABL and DNAJC14/RP11. viral cofactors associated with each of the cancer samples are correctly recovered at a high dynamic range of read abundances between RPMM and RPMM (HeLa cell line associated with HPV18) several viral fragments were successfully reconstructed within HORs of the positive control samples. reads from each sample panel and each tumor stage (4 or 4S) were pooled for analysis. all HORs were associated with low relative read abundances of RPMM compared to confirmed viral signatures of experimental positive controls.

Virana was the only method able to detect all viral families independent of sequence divergence. both RINS and CaPSID discarded a substantial amount of homologous transcripts due to their high similarity to the human reference genome. these false positive hits are limited to only two viral families (Flaviviridae and Retroviridae) that display high sequence similarity to human factors. these hits are additionally annotated with an ambiguous taxonomic origin by Virana. our approach aims to counteract these confounding factors by two strategies. first by sequencing neuroblastoma transcriptomes at comparatively high depth. second by using several biological replicates at different tumor stages. we can conclude that our approach requires minimal abundances of only two average-length viral transcripts per cell even under adverse conditions. in HERV-K abundances, no quantitative difference between neuroblastoma stages 4 and 4S could be identified with regard to viral transcription. our observations provide negative evidence regarding the question of putative viral cofactors of metastatic neuroblastoma."}
