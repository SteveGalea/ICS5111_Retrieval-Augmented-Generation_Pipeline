{"summary": "retrospective longitudinal study was conducted using Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database collected during 1997\u20132005. patients with incident severe gallstone disease (acute cholecystitis, biliary pancreatitis, acute cholangitis) and gallstone-related procedures were identified. annual incidence rates of gallstone-related complications and procedures were calculated and their 95% confidence intervals were estimated assuming a Poisson distribution. cholelithiasis led to 325,000 hospitalizations in the us in 2005. the prevalence of gallstone disease is higher in older individuals and females. the prevalence of gallstone disease is higher in older individuals and females. the source population for this study was all beneficiaries aged 20 or above during 1996\u20132005. asymptomatic disease, disease of lesser severity that did not result in hospitalization, and biliary colic not requiring surgical or endoscopic procedures were not studied. the incidence of biliary pancreatitis was calculated after excluding cases possibly caused by alcohol use. we excluded data in 1996 because events occurred in that year that could not be correctly counted as incident or prevalent events. annual rates of hospital admission for severe gallstone disease (acute cholecystitis, biliary pancreatitis, acute cholangitis) among the study population were calculated by dividing the number of patients with confirmed incident gallstone disease by the mid-year. age-adjusted gender-specific rates were directly standardized by applying the age-specific rates to those of the population in 2000. the source population for this study was all beneficiaries aged 20 or above during 1996\u20132005. selection of cases Severe gallstone disease was defined as gallstone-related complications (acute cholecystitis, biliary pancreatitis, and acute cholangitis) that lead to hospitalization. ary pancreatitis was calculated after excluding cases possibly caused by alcohol use. we excluded data in 1996 because events occurred in that year that could not be correctly counted as incident or prevalent events. annual rates of hospital admission for severe gallstone disease (acute cholecystitis, biliary pancreatitis, acute cholangitis) were calculated by dividing the number of patients with confirmed incident gallstone disease by the mid-year Taiwanese population of that year. age-adjusted gender-specific rates were directly standardized by applying the age-specific rates to those of the population in 2000. 155,322 incident cases included diabetes in 11% of cases, chronic liver disease in 3%, hyperlipidemia in 1%, alcoholism in 0.2%, and hemolytic disease in 0.3%. the mean annual population of Taiwan aged 20 years or older during 1997\u20132005 was 15,863,966. 0.11 (0.10\u20130.11) 4,214 0.13 (0.12\u20130.13) 40 \u2013 59 10,697 0.43 (0.42\u20130.43) 9,645 0.39 (0.38\u20130.40) 60 \u2013 79 15,418 1.38 (1.36\u20131.40) 13,443 1.28 (1.26\u20131.30) 80 3,488 2.43 (2.35\u20132.51) 3,804 2.50 (2.42\u20132.57) All ages 33,320 0.46 (0.46\u20130.46) 31, 47\u20130.48) 19,861 0.80 (0.79\u20130.81) 60 \u2013 79 12,963 1.16 (1.14\u20131.18) 15,414 1.47 (1.44\u20131.49) 80 1,793 1.25 (1.19\u20131.30) 1,775 1.16 (1.11\u20131.22) All ages 31,442 0.43 (0.43\u20130.44) 46,445 0.66 (0.65\u20130.67) Non-elective cholecystectomy 20 \u2013 39 2,791 0. the increase in the incidence of acute cholangitis was more marked for men (91%) than for women (32%; test for interaction p 0.001) the increase in the incidence of biliary pancreatitis was similar for men and women. for both men and women, the hospital admission rates for elective cholecystectomy increased steadily from 1997 to 2001 then gradually decreased especially during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak in 2003. for both men and women, the upward trend in hospital admissions for gallstone receiving ERCP was significant (test for trend p 0.001). age-standardized incident hospital admission rates of gallstone-related complications for age group (20\u201339, 40\u201359, 60\u201379, and 80) in the younger population (20\u201339), increase in the incidences of all gallstone-related complications was significant (82% for acute cholecystitis, 70% for biliary pancreatitis, and 63% for acute cholangitis. increasing use of ERCP occurred in almost all age groups. trend in incident hospital admission rates of gallstone-related procedures occurred in almost all age groups. the incidence rate of all gallstone diseases per 100,000 population decreased from 127.8 in 1988\u20131991 to 114.2 in 1992\u20132000. this decline was attributed to the widespread adoption of laparoscopic cholecystectomy leading to a reduction in the incidence of acute cholecystitis. a modest increase in incidence of gallstone diseases in 10-year intervals may also play a role. incidence of acute biliary pancreatitis increased from 1970 to 2000. the proportion of patients with common bile duct stones decreased in Taiwan and Korea from 1980 to late 1990. study observed significant increase in the incidence of biliary pancreatitis. the rate of acute cholecystitis was higher for men than women. but the change in cholecystectomy rates were almost parallel in both genders. the strengths of our study were use of a nationwide data with large sample size, presentation of incidence trends in the recent decade. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors' contributions JH, JLW, CHC, and WYS designed the study and wrote the manuscript. authors read and approved the final manuscript."}
