{"summary": "RV is classified in different groups or species based on viral protein 6 (VP6) antigenic- and nucleotide-related features. RV from types A (RV-A), B (RV-B), C (RV-C), E (RV-E) and H (RV-H) have been detected in pigs. IHC stains RV-positive granules in the cytoplasm of enterocytes, with a positive staining peak at 31\u201348 hpi. the staining is more intense in the distal and middle portions of the small intestine, although there can be positive enterocytes in the duodenum, cecum, and colon. the team performed autopsies on 32 affected piglets that were severely dehydrated and in poor body condition. in total, 28 severely affected piglets were euthanized with a barbiturate overdose. one piglet from outbreak A and 3 piglets from outbreak D died before the veterinary pathology team arrived at the farms. veterinary practitioners who attended outbreak B euthanized 2 piglets with a barbiturate overdose, immediately performed autopsies, and collected and sent refrigerated and 10% buffered formalin\u2013fixed intestinal samples to the Veterinary Pathology Sector. immunohistochemistry sections of jejunum, ileum, and colon from all 34 piglets underwent IHC staining using streptavidin\u2013biotin linked to peroxidase. endogenous peroxidase blocking was performed through incubation of sections in 10% hydrogen peroxide in methanol solution for 15 min. antibody against RV-A VP6 protein was diluted 1:100 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) positive intestinal sections were examined (at a magnification of 400) a positive cell per field (CPF) count was established using the average of 10 fields. sections with a CPF count 1 were considered mild IHC labeling. a CPF count of 1\u20131.5 was considered moderate, and a CPF >1.5 was considered marked. RT-PCR assays to detect coronavirus were carried out using specific primers to amplify the spike protein coding region (859 bp) and the membrane protein gene (377 bp), respectively. the amplicons were analyzed by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gel in TBE buffer, pH 8.4. one amplicon for each detected virus per diarrhea outbreak was selected for sequence analysis. the team from the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul performed autopsies on 32 affected piglets that were severely dehydrated and in poor body condition. in total, 28 severely affected piglets were euthanized with a barbiturate overdose. one piglet from outbreak A and 3 piglets from outbreak D died before the veterinary pathology team arrived at the farms. these piglets were not included in the enteric viral assay and bacterial culture because they were in a more advanced state of autolysis compared to piglets sampled immediately after euthanasia. veterinary practitioners who attended outbreak B euthanized 2 piglets with a barbiturate overdose, immediately performed autopsies, and collected and sent antibody against RV-A VP6 protein (Rotavirus Omnitope polyclonal goat serum, ViroStat, Portland, ME) was diluted 1:100 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and applied to the slides in a humid chamber overnight at 4\u00b0C. a slide of pig intestinal sections that tested positive previously for RV-A in both PCR and IHC was used as the positive control. positive intestinal sections were examined (at a magnification of 400) a positive cell per field (CPF) count was established using the average of 10 fields. sections with a CPF count 1 were considered mild IHC labeling. a CPF count of 1\u20131.5 was considered moderate, and a CPF >1.5 was considered marked. RT-PCR assays to detect coronavirus were carried out using specific primers to amplify the spike protein coding region (859 bp) and the membrane protein gene (377 bp), respectively. the amplicons were analyzed by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gel in TBE buffer, pH 8.4 (89 mM Tris, 89 mM boric acid, 2 mM EDTA) the most frequent small intestinal histologic lesions were villus atrophy (29 of 34), vacuolation of epithelial cells at the tips of villi (27 of 34), cell debris in the lamina propria (LP; 20 of 34; Table 2). in outbreak D, RV and KoV were detected in 6 samples each. 6 0 of 6 0 of 6 5 of 6 4 of 6 2 of 6 0 of 6 1 of 6 0 of 6 0 of 6 1 of 6 0 of 6 0 of 6 1 of 6 0 of 6 0 of 6 1 of 6 1 of 6 0 of 6 0 of 6 1 of 6 1 of 6 0 of 6 0 of 6 0 of 6 1 of 6 D 10 of 11 10 of 11 7 of 11 2 of 11 1 of 11 1 of 11 0 of 11 IHC staining was observed in 5 cases of outbreak A and 2 cases from outbreak B. outbreaks C and D had no cases with marked staining. RV was detected by molecular assays in 20 of 30 cases. four cases in relatively advanced autolysis underwent histologic and IHC analysis. agreement between RT-PCR and IHC detection occurred in 17 of 30 cases. Clostridium sp. was isolated in 15 cases. there were no histologic findings suggestive of clostridial infection. piglets from outbreak B were older, and passive protection can impair the function of antibody-secreting cells from the host. piglets from outbreak B were older, and passive protection can impair the function of antibody-secreting cells from the host. this outbreak had 5 samples positive for RV by either IHC or RT-PCR analysis. outbreak C had 5 cases positive (in IHC and/or RT-PCR) for RV. 5 cases with E. coli\u2013compatible bacteria adherent to the epithelium. the most likely scenario is that these lesions were caused by RV because the lesions can occur in intestinal segments where there is no virus. villus atrophy and epithelial vacuolation are caused by several intestinal viruses,6,7,16,30. viroplasms are electron-dense structures filled with VP6 antigen that are formed inside infected cells during RV replication. viroplasms are isolated round spots positioned next to the nucleus, suggesting a high homology between RV-A and RV-C. single detection of RV-C was found in only 3 of 102 fecal samples analyzed in that study. our study agrees with these results."}
