{"summary": "HTLV-1 is the etiologic agent of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) in infected individuals. HTLV-1 is the etiologic agent of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic parapare HTLV-1 Tax acts to transactivate the viral long terminal repeat (LTR) through tax-responsive elements (TREs) in the U3 region. this occurs through transcriptional induction of TREs, posttranslational modifications of TRE-binding factors, and binding with transcription factors. tax is known to interact with the transcription factors CREB, serum-responsive factor, and NF-B. tax activates HTLV-1 transcription through CREB and three CRE enhancer sequences on the LTR. tax also interacts with CBP/p300, which is involved in the formation of the preinitiation complex and the p300/CBP-associated factor, P/CAF. tax is heavily involved in direct interactions with critical cellular proteins that control not only viral gene expression but also cellular genes involved in tumor formation. HTLV-1 infection in the presence of Tax significantly downregulates Drosha protein expression. the changes in cellular miRNA expression in HTLV-1 infected cells can be mimicked in uninfected cells. retroviruses have been shown to control the cellular RNAi pathway. DGCR8, Dicer, Ago2, and -Actin were detected in three uninfected, tax-positive cells. Drosha protein levels were significantly downregulated in all of the HTLV-1 infected, tax-positive cells. DGCR8 and Ago2 showed no significant changes in protein level amongst all cell lines screened. HTLV-1 infected primary CD4+ primary T-cells were screened for endogenous protein levels of Drosha, DGCR8, Dicer, and Ago2. total lysates of HTLV-1 infected, Tax-negative cell lines were titrated. RT-PCR was performed for cellular Drosha transcript levels. uninfected 293T cells were transfected with pcDNA (0.1, 1.0, and 10 g), pACH (0.1, 1.0, and 10 g), pcTax (0.1, 1.0, and 10 g) cells were western blotted for the presence of Drosha, Dicer, Ago2, and -Actin. the western blot serves as a positive control for tax expression. the -Actin western serves as a positive loading control. we transfected pcTax into HeLa cells and stained the cells 48 hours post-transfection for confocal imaging. we labeled both untransfected and tax-transfected HeLa cells with antibodies against BRG1, Drosha, Rb, GIT2 and Tax. cells stained for BRG1 (A), Drosha (B, C), Rb (D) and GIT2 (E) cells were stained with confocal microscopy. cellular protein staining is represented in green, tax staining in red, and yellow foci represent colocalization of dual stained cells. we transfected 293T cells with the HTLV-1 clone pACH.Tax (5 g) or pACH.M22 (5 g) mutant Tax. this mutant is unable to interact with the proteasome. this mutant is only faintly ubiquitinylated and can\u2019t interact with the proteasome. the western blot recognizes all three isoforms of Drosha. the strongest binding is to the 170 kDa form. a ubiquitin western blot is included as an indication that Drosha is being ubiquitinated. lysate was incubated with -IgG, -Drosha, or -Tax overnight at 4\u00b0C. the next day, 50 l of a 30% Protein A + G slurry was used to IP Drosha or Tax and subsequently western blotted for the presence of Drosha and Ubiquitin. both PSI and ALLN treated cells showed an increase in Drosha protein levels compared to C81 cells alone. all treated cells showed no toxicity across three independent experiments. this data further indicates that Drosha protein levels can be rescued from suppression by HTLV-1 infection with proteasome inhibitors. this suggests that Drosha is targeted by tax to be degraded via the proteasomal pathway. the expression of miR326 was determined by the quantiMiR PCR kit. the tax mutants spanning from residue 99 to 353 have no functional implications for miR326 expression. these mutants are as functional as the Tax WT. tax interacts with the proteasome at residues 23\u201362, depicted as the grey shaded area. this data agrees with the interactions of Tax and Drosha in Figure 3. the N-terminus of Tax is responsible for Drosha binding. a graphical depiction of the tax mutant constructs TD1 and TD55. the function of each domain is indicated in brackets and arrows. the proposed Drosha binding region is indicated by the grey shaded box. it is important to distinguish between a Drosha-specific dysregulation. western blot confirmation of the siRNA knockdowns is shown in Figure 5B. we treated 293T cells transfected with pACH with the RISC/Ago2 inhibitor Acriflavine (ACF) at 72 hours post transfection, we collected supernatants and assayed for the presence of virus via RT. HTLV-1 infection results in a dramatic up (i.e. miR-130b, miR-18a, miR-20b) and downregulation of many host cellular miRNAs. the modulation of these host miRNAs has an effect on the expression of cellular proteins such as p300, NF-B, and BRM. antagomiRs used include anti-hsa-Let-7i to target p50 and p65 miRNA, anti-hsa-miR-132 to target GSK-3 miRNA, and anti-hsa-miR199a-3p to target IKK- and BRM miRNA. western blots were performed for IKK-, p65, p50, GSK-3, and -Actin. 293T cells were transfected with tax (5 g) or antagomiRs (100 nM) targeting miR-199a-3p, miR-132, or Let7i. western blotted (50 g) for each indicated protein normalized to -Actin. HTLV-1 infection has been shown to impart a specific suppression of Dicer expression in monocyte-derived-macrophages as compared to T-cells. total protein levels of Drosha, DGCR8, Dicer, Ago2 and -Actin were detected in three HTLV-1 infected cells, as well as in three HTLV-1 infected, Tax-positive T-cell lines. we titrated both MT1 and ED- cells in order to determine if this downregulation was an artifact. the relative decrease in Drosha is less in HTLV-1 infected, tax-negative cells as compared to tax-positive cells. total lysates of HTLV-1 infected cell lines ED- and MT1 were titrated (50, 75 and 100 g) and screened for endogenous protein levels of Drosha, DGCR8, Dicer, and Ago2. RT-PCR was performed for cellular Drosha transcript levels. 293T cells were transfected with three concentrations (0.1, 1.0, 10 g) of plasmids expressing pACH (full-length HTLV-1 clone), pcTax, pACH.M22 (mutated tax gene), or an empty vector control. the pACH.M22 plasmid contains a double amino acid substitution at positions 130 and 131 and eliminates the ability of Tax to transactivate the NF-B western blot serves as a positive loading control for tax expression. HTLV-1 infection in the presence of tax downregulates the RNAi enzyme Drosha in chronically infected cell lines, transfected cells, and primary cells infected. GIT2 serves as a negative control for a protein that does not shuttle to the nucleus or colocalize in the presence of Tax. cells were stained for BRG1 (A), Drosha (B, C), Rb (D), and GIT2 (E) motifs used for dimerization and activation of NF-B [5], [58]\u2013[61]. to identify the domain of Tax that binds to Drosha, we performed an in vitro binding assay using full-length Tax and various fragments covering the entire tax protein fused to GST. the binding was observed at the N-terminal domain that contained sequence 1\u2013244. 293T cells serve as a positive control for the Drosha western blot (lane 1) and a positive control for the Drosha IP/western blot (lane 3). the mutant ACH.M22 Tax is unable to interact with Drosha (lane 7) this mutant is only faintly ubiquitinylated and can\u2019t interact with the proteasome. GST-Tax wild type, GST-Tax N-terminus, 1\u2013244, GST-Tax C-terminus, 244\u2013336, and GST-Tax truncated, 288\u2013353. lysates were prepared from cells alone or cells transfected with pACH.Tax (5 g) or pACH.M22 (5 g) in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor PSI (10 M) HTLV-1 infected C81 cells were treated with proteasome inhibitors PSI and ALLN. at 48 hours post-treatment, the cells were collected and western blotted for the presence of Drosha. the 10 M-treated cells showed almost a 30% increase in Drosha protein levels compared to C81 cells alone. the expression of miR326 was determined by the quantiMiR PCR kit. the tax mutants spanning from residue 99 to 353 have no functional implications for miR326 expression. the tax mutants are as functional as the Tax WT. the tax D1 mutant decreased Drosha functionality by 25% compared to the control. the mutant increased the efficiency of processing of Drosha 100%. however, only increased the relative miR326 expression 1.5 fold. y-eight hours post transfection, total RNA was isolated by TRIzol extraction. expression of miR326 was determined by quantiMiR PCR kit using primers specific to miR326. values shown are normalized to U6 and shown relative to control. pACH clone was able to replicate well with the highest concentration of siDrosha. the loss of DGCR8 across all three concentrations of siRNA resulted in a consistent activation of viral replication. a knockdown of Ago2 did not result in a significant increase in viral replication. HTLV-1 infection results in a dramatic up (i.e. miR-130b, miR-18a, miR-20b) and downregulation of many host cellular miRNAs. the modulation of these host miRNAs has an effect on the expression of cellular proteins such as p300, NF-B, and BRM. tax would decrease Drosha levels, resulting in downregulation of miRNAs. cellular miRNAs, such as Let-7i, miR-199a-3p, and miR-132, are downregulated after infection. a set of cellular miRNAs are known to be recruited and utilized by the HTLV-1 promoter. densitometry counts of western blots for each indicated protein normalized to -Actin, plotted as a percent change (measured as arbitrary counts) between antagomiR treated cells and 293T cells alone. HTLV-1 is an oncogenic retrovirus which targets and manipulates common cellular tumor suppressors and signaling pathways in order to establish and maintain a productive infection. all DNA tumor viruses encode viral miRNAs which modulate tumorigenesis, thus indicating that the cellular RNAi pathway is important for viral pathogenesis and control. we have demonstrated that Drosha is downregulated in HTLV-1 infected cell lines. we have also shown that Dicer is downregulated in HTLV-1 infected cell lines only. this suggests that this loss of Dicer could be due to a cell line specific phenomenon. the N-terminus of Tax is most commonly known for the CREB (cAMP-responsive element-binding)-transactivation domain. the transcription factors p300/CBP, and p/CAF (p300/CBP-associated factor) bind and promote viral transcription from the LTR. this interaction is not seen when a cell is expressing the tax mutant, ACH.M22. three large studies have examined the dysregulation of cellular miRNAs in both HTLV-1 infected cell lines and ATLL samples. these studies provide a large pool of upregulated and downregulated cellular miRNAs from which to pull functional data in the context of HTLV-1 infection. endogenous Drosha is less functional and not as efficient in processing miRNAs in the presence of tax. HTLV-1 infection downregulates a particular miRNA which targets a cellular protein necessary for tax transactivation. if HTLV-1 downregulates a particular miRNA, we could mimic this interaction by introducing an antagomiR into uninfected cells. miR-199a-3p has been shown to regulate IKK- to affect NF-B activity. antagomiRs mimic the cellular protein expression seen in tax-expressing cells. tax plays a major role in the activation of cellular NF-B. HTLV-1 infected cells develop tax-independent activation of NF-B. DMEM containing 10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine, and 1% streptomycin/penicillin (Quality Biological) at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2.
