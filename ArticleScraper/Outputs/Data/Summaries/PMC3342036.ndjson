{"summary": "the increasing depth and breadth of immunological studies is also bringing to light a greater awareness of the impact that immunity has had on all forms of life. this discussion excludes a broad range of behavioral defenses like avoidance or preening. the role of immune systems in macroevolutionary processes is one that deserves recognition and more study. the role of immune systems in macroevolutionary processes is one that deserves recognition and more study. similarities between membrane-associated and intracytoplasmic receptors of plants and animals suggest that some basic solutions to recognition and response to parasites have been conserved since at least the time animal and plant lineages diverged. however, some of these similarities are a likely result of convergent evolution rather than indicative of a common origin. oligoadenylate system Scavenger receptor cysteine-rich molecules Wiens et al.

(2008) Cnidaria (anemones, corals, jellyfish, Hydra Diploblastic with mesoglea No No Bonafide TLR and NF-B pathway, complement-3 component, multiple NACHT domains and NLRs likely, recognizable RAG1 homolog. Triploblastic Yes No Over 100 TLR genes, extensive involvement of coelomocytes from coelom in defense, cytotoxicity against allogeneic cells, hemolytic and clotting factors in body fluid, antimicrobial peptides, and protective body mucus. lectin and alternative pathways, RAG1 and RAG2 homologs present In addition to expanded sets of TLRs, NLRs, and SRCRs, they also have novel Sp 185/333 gene family producing diverse immune proteins Messier-Solek et al. (2010), Hibino et al. (2006), Ghosh et al. (2010). the most basal animal group is the phylum Porifera, the sponges. phylum Porifera has membrane-spanning molecules that contain an intracellular Toll-interleukin 1 receptor (TIR) domain. the starlet sea anemone Nematostella vectensis has at least one TLR, an NF-B signaling pathway, a homolog of a complement 3-like molecule, the likely presence of functioning intracellular NOD-like receptors (NLRs), perforin-like molecules, diverse C-type lectins. the remaining animals, the Bilateria, are bilaterally symmetrical and triploblastic, with well-developed tissues and organs. ide TLR that plays a role in defense against some bacteria lacks Myd88, NF-B and several other components of the canonical Toll pathway. C-type lectins may serve as recognition molecules in C. elegans. insect studies provide additional examples of immunological novelty, at the ordinal, family, or even genus level. a comparison of three different mosquito genera has revealed prominent genus specific expansion of some immune gene families. novel immune genes and immune gene families have originated relatively recently. for particular immune proteins, the amino acids under positive selection vary between Drosophila species groups. insects with very different life styles, such as the social honey bees, and ants (Smith et al., 2011), and symbiont-dependent aphids (Pennisi, 2009) also have immune systems that are surprisingly divergent from the Drosophila immune system. sea urchins possess >220 TLR genes (vertebrates usually have 21\u201325), >200 NLRs (mammals have 20\u201335), >200 SRCR genes (humans have 16; Messier-Solek et al., 2010), and a novel Sp 185/333 gene family. the latter gene family produces a repertoire of defense proteins more diverse than the sequence diversity encoded in the genes. urochordates lack obvious expansions of any gene family highly relevant to vertebrate immunity. urochordates lack obvious expansions of any gene family highly relevant to vertebrate immunity. urochordates lack obvious expansions of any gene family highly relevant to vertebrate immunity. gnathostomes lack RAG1 and RAG2 and do not produce TCRs or Ig. gnathostome adaptive immune system features a close collaboration between innate and adaptive arms. gnathostome adaptive immune system features a close collaboration between innate and adaptive arms. there is considerable variability among gnathostomes in how their immune systems function. however, it is argued from the examples provided above that at least as compelling are the differences between and within phyla, even among species in a genus. animals have been extant and diversifying for up to 800 million years. they have adopted a diversity of life styles: sessile, colonial predators; inhabitants of extreme environments dependent on chemosynthetic symbionts; pelagic species that live in enormous schools; inhabitants of arid terrestrial environments; social species living in large colonies; and endoparasites that are so modified morphologically. the adoption of body plans differing in complexity and mass has also influenced immune system structure and function. evolution of the vertebrate jaw and an accompanying predatory life style introduced parasites into the gut and required a more elaborate adaptive immune system that now typifies gnathostomes. if all emerging animal lineages had the same defenses, it would be possible for an effective parasite that had overcome the defenses of one host group to spread into another host phylum. being immunologically different increases the odds that parasites from other inhabitants of the same coral reef are not as easily acquired. ichneumonid and braconid hymenopteran parasitoids have acquired mutualistic polydnaviruses that function to suppress the immune responsiveness of their hosts. however, without the aid of viral symbionts, larvae of digenetic trematodes secrete both anti-oxidants and immunosuppressive factors that down-regulate snail host immune components. this is not to imply that only animal parasites have developed lineage-specific associations

creating an advantage of rareness. being immunologically different increases the odds that parasites from other inhabitants of the same coral reef are not as easily acquired. being immunologically different increases the odds that parasites from other inhabitants of the same coral reef are not as easily acquired. lineage-specific animal parasites are another general factor expected to drive immunological novelty. these parasites often establish prolonged, intimate, and extensive infections in their chosen hosts. ichneumonid and braconid hymenopteran parasitoids have acquired mutualistic polydnaviruses that function to suppress the immune responsiveness of their hosts and facilitate parasitoid infection. imply that only animal parasites have developed lineage-specific associations with hosts. merely serves to illustrate the concept that particular host lineages acquire unique parasites that are likely to have distinctive methods of infectivity that could influence their host\u2019s immune systems. microevolutionary processes occur below the species level, within and among populations of either host or parasite species. these microevolutionary processes may culminate in speciation of either participant. speciation may be accompanied by colonization of new habitats, and further divergence. parasites have limited ranges of host species, often with restricted ranges of habitats within their chosen host lineages. parasites like Schistosoma japonicum, toxoplasma gondii, Borrelia burgdorferi, or the rabies virus routinely infect a remarkably broad range of host species. encounter and compatibility filters operate to restrict the spectrum of host usage. parasite infectivity is not always dependent on a long accommodation to a particular host species. experimental infections of new hosts with parasites essentially bypass the encounter filter. a role for unsuitability should not be discounted and could be manifested in several ways. the extraordinary diversity of strategies undertaken by parasites to evade, manipulate, or suppress the immune system is testament to the impact of immunity on their success. examples of colonizing parasites, or parasites placed in novel hosts, that are engaged and killed by immune responses. trypanosome Trypanosoma brucei brucei brucei brucei by apolipoprotein L-1 in serum of humans who are refractory to this subspecies. disruption of the Erk-STAT1 signaling pathway allows cross species transmission of the normally rabbit-specific myxoma virus to mice. different strains of influenza A virus likely have NS1 genes adapted to antagonize the IFN/ antiviral system of their specific host species. variola proteins are particularly adept at overcoming human immunity relative to vaccinia. ubiquity of host defenses argue that host immune systems play a critical role in limiting parasite host ranges and thereby at least in part dictate the specialization so characteristic of parasitic organisms. some patterns of parasite host specificity can be attributed to the operation of specific immune evasion strategies, and such strategies are pervasive among parasites. the interactions between a host and parasite species can be expected to be variable across space. parasite abundance will vary across local scales, possibly because of the variable presence of other hosts needed to complete its life cycle. local adaptation to host immunity could potentially lead to 'assortative survival'. parasites often seek mates and undergo sexual reproduction within their hosts. fluctuations in local patterns of abundance may diminish local adaptation. parasites are often cited as examples of specialists because they have limited ranges of host species. parasites like Schistosoma japonicum, toxoplasma gondii, Borrelia burgdorferi, or the rabies virus routinely infect a broad range of host species. parasites like the rabies virus routinely infect a broad range of host species. the compatibility filter includes both physiological and biochemical suitability of the host to support the parasite, and the active defense provided by the immune system. many examples of emerging infections owe their emergence to a change in the encounter filter such that a new combination of parasite and host are juxtaposed. the immune system is associated with increased susceptibility to several different pathogens. the parasite replicates poorly or is inefficiently transmitted in a new host. the extraordinary diversity of strategies undertaken by parasites is testament to the impact of immunity on their success. -host Raja radiata kills the tapeworm Acanthobothrium quadripartitum. larvae survive in serum of the normal host, Raja naevus. parasite immune evasive factors can prevent cross species transfer. lococcus aureus isolates from humans depend on different virulence factor genes. different strains of influenza A virus likely have NS1 genes adapted to antagonize the IFN/ antiviral system of their specific host species. specialization and attendant host specificity is a central, emergent property of parasitism and has multiple underlying determinants. ubiquity of host defenses argue that host immune systems play a critical role in limiting parasite host ranges and thereby at least in part dictate the specialization so characteristic of parasitic organisms. e groups closely tied to their hosts and with limited options for colonization of new hosts may occur if the hosts upon which they are found themselves speciate. persistence of new daughter parasite species should be favored by the fact that the parental species had already achieved successful accommodation to the parental host species. ivity to their hosts is a pervasive phenomenon. this is likely driven in part by variations in immune evasive measures taken by parasites. this is likely driven in part by variations in immune evasive measures. localized parasite-coevolutionary races select hosts to prefer immunologically similar conspecifics and avoid out-group individuals. this mechanism has also been predicted to lead to parasite diversification (Fincher and Thornhill, 2008) a study of host switches in bats involving the fast-evolving RNA virus causing rabies showed the success of cross species transfers diminished as the phylogenetic distances among the hosts involved increased. major clades are associated with shifts into different families of dipteran vectors, and the Plasmodium species of birds and squamate reptiles show evidence of repeated switching back and forth. Coronaviruses have undergone several host switches, between mouse and rat, chicken and turkey, birds and mammals, and between humans and other mammals. a host switch can lead to a speciation event if the parasite in the new host becomes isolated from the founding stock. host switches are often favored by changes in the encounter and not the compatibility filter. in cross species transfers of rabies into bats, the vast majority are dead ends. in cross species transfers of rabies into bats, the vast majority are dead ends. the role of immune systems in preventing such infections would be easy to underestimate. the result is a failed experiment that in all probability we never even knew had happened. innate immunity in routinely preventing acquisition of new parasites is probably considerable and easy to underestimate. Varroa mites (Varroa destructor) in honey bees (Apis mellifera) suppress the activity of several immune-related genes. the malaria parasite Plasmodium gallinaceum suppresses the encapsulation response of the mosquito Aedes aegypti. HIV in people was associated with parasites that rarely if ever had been implicated in causing human disease including microsporidia, cryptosporidia, JC virus, and Mycobacterium avium. studies suggest taxonomic distinctiveness of ectoparasites and endoparasite richness are positively correlated across species of rodent hosts. high host density, stressful thermal (Bruno et al., 2007) or oxygen regimes, and even mating (Rolf romised individual of a new host species likely to be temporary and not lead to speciation unless the new parasite can better adapt to its new host. Availability of populations of similarly immunocompromised new hosts could favor divergence from the founding parasite and speciation. comparisons of rodents have associated helminth species richness with increased MHC class II polymorphisms. the evidence supporting the idea that variability in immune response driven by parasites can be a factor favoring speciation of host lineages. differentiation resulting from antagonistic interactions with parasites would provide the substrate for further diversification of host lineages. local adaptation and assortative mating could be augmented by assortative mating mediated by sexual selection to favor further divergence of new host species. females prefer conspicuously colored males. conditions of light penetration favor blue males in shallow depths and red males in deeper waters. parasites encountered at different depths also vary in density and composition. interactions between hybrids and parasites may be reinforced by breakdown of co-adapted immune gene complexes among their hybrids. hybridization contributes to formation of new species by allopolyploidy, as has been postulated for anurans. the study of immunology is relevant to extinction in at least three broad contexts outlined below. it has long been argued that specialization leads to a greater probability of extinction because if the host on which the specialized parasite is dependent undergoes severe population fluctuations or itself goes extinct. a generalist parasite able to exploit alternative hosts would have a greater likelihood of surviving under similar circumstances. in some cases, invasion of a parasite can occur even without the benefit of a simultaneous introduction of its indigenous host. the invading species may enjoy a distinct advantage over its competitors in its relative freedom from parasites. the relative inability of parasites to colonize an introduced host is a testament to the specialization often required to achieve infectivity. eels mount immune responses that prevent a high and robust population of worms from building up. many parasite introductions fail because colonist is unable to breach indigenous host defenses. a third context in which immunology becomes relevant to extinction is the role played by diminution of diversity in key immune loci such as the MHC. the role of random drift in diminishing allelic diversity in bottlenecked or fragmented host populations would seem to increase the risk of successful parasite attack. there is a need to determine if other factors like genome-wide inbreeding depression are more important in causing extinction. diversity in immune systems among and within phyla is in and of itself a major macroevolutionary pattern that should become a more central part of how we characterize animal diversity. study of model parasite\u2013host systems shows that the strength of selection imposed on particular immune genes is strong. if we adopt a broader perspective with a longer time frame, it seems likely such intense interactions will have an impact on cladogenesis, the origin of lineages, as well."}
