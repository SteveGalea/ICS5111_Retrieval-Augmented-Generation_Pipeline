{"summary": "the concept of One Health is currently advancing with the emergence and spread of epizootics, zoonoses, and epidemics. the risks of pandemics have become an increasing critical challenge (2). the misuse and overuse of antibiotics generate selective evolutionary pressures that increase the chance of survival of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which puts individuals at risk of becoming infected by drug-resistant bacteria. the development of novel and efficient extraction techniques has led to renewed and increasing interest in plant-derived bioactive compounds. some plant-derived compounds have weaker antibiotic activity than the common chemicals produced by bacteria and fungi. this review attempts to provide knowledge about zoonotic diseases and insight into the rich variety of antimicrobial secondary metabolites (i.e., phytochemicals) from plants that can be applied in the treatment of zoonoses. gram-positive bacterium commonly exists on the skin and mucous membranes of healthy humans and animals. but it has also been recognized as a significant opportunistic pathogen in chickens and farmed rabbits and has been reported to cause mastitis in dairy-producing animals. campylobacter jejuni and C. coli are representative pathogens that are a major cause of human gastroenteritis. their predominant ecological niche is the gastrointestinal tract of a wide range of domesticated and wild vertebrates. zoonotic transmission from animals to people via meat, especially chicken, is a food safety issue. pets have been identified as notable reservoirs for human infection, implying a potentially high risk of humans. pathogenic bartonella spp. are endotheliotropic bacteria with a distinctive mechanism for invasion into host cells. cat fleas, sand flies, human body lice, and many other flea species can transmit certain Bartonella spp. leptospirosis is an endemic bacterium in many domestic and wild animals. it spreads through urine (28) and causes leptospirosis in humans and animals. it can cause fever, meningitis, kidney damage, respiratory distress, liver failure and even death. salmonella is an opportunistic pathogen that causes food poisoning, typhoid fever, enteric fever, and gastroenteritis. the respiratory illness psittacosis caused by Chlamydia sp. in humans and animals was first reported approximately 100 years ago. only 218 reports on illness were found when searched using \u201cChlamydial, Zoonoses\u201d in the NCBI database. the collapse of gut microbial ecosystems due to antibiotics could cause undesired negative effects, such as altered physiology of the body or susceptibility to infectious diseases. plant therapy is one of the oldest medical fields traditionally based on empiricism and is considered the largest source of new antibiotics to address antibiotic resistance. phytochemicals with antioxidant activity include monoterpenes (aromatic plants), diterpenes (berries and essential oils), triterpenes (olive oil and leaves), tetraterpenes (colored fruits and vegetables), sesquiterpenes (essential oils), and polyphenols (from tea and grapes) andrographolide (Andrographis paniculata), oridonin Antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antioxidant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (41, 44) Triterpenes Olives, olive tree leaves, and virgin olive oil Oleanolic acid, ursolic acid, ginsenoside, gypenosides. phytochemicals, which are bioactive plant components with an amphipathic or hydrophobic structure, exhibit antitumor, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects. phytochemicals are known to exhibit pharmacological effects on interaction with microbial membranes, such as changes in membrane permeability and microviscosity. monoterpenes, such as palmarosa oil, cinnamon oil, geraniol, carvacrol, eugenol, and thymol, are present in aromatic plants, fruits, vegetables, and herbs. cinnamon oil exhibits antimicrobial activity on both planktonic and attached cells of clinically isolated S. epidermidis and S. aureus strains. monoterpenes carvacrol and thymol are essential oils of Origanum and Thymus species (64) they have been extensively tested as antimicrobial compounds against pathogens, including B. cereus, E. coli O157:H7, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria monocytogenes, Sa. typhimurium, S. aureus, Pseudomonas fluorescens, and Vibrio chol triterpenes, including oleanolic and ursolic acids, exhibit antibacterial activity as adjuvants of aminoglycoside. other triterpenoids, such as betulinic acid, rotundic acid, and amyrin, have shown anti-staphylococcal activities. phytochemicals can be synergistically used with antibiotics to develop different antibacterial mechanisms. anthocyanins and cyanidins have been shown to inhibit the growth of E. coli (51) flavonoids have a broad spectrum of pharmacological activities. p-Coumaric acid shows antibacterial activity against E. coli by destroying cell membranes and binding to the bacterial genomic DNA. phytomedicines, in particular Triticum aestivum L. and Theobroma cacao L., have been used in zoos to treat gastrointestinal pain and diarrhea in african elephants (Loxodonta africana) and crab-eating macaques (70). the effective use of plant extracts with antimicrobial, antioxidant, and immune-boosting effects in combination with antibiotics can work synergistically and may provide a solution for management of antibiotic-resistant in this review, we have summarized representative bacterial zoonoses in humans and animals. representative strain, transmission routes, infection site, and symptoms are summarized. bacterium is most commonly isolated from staphylococcosis cases. campylobacteriosis is a common disease transmitted from other livestock, e.g., farmed cattle, swine, or poultry, with staphylococcosis (22). zoonotic transmission from animals to people via meat, especially chicken, is a food safety issue. common cat scratch disease is primarily caused by Bartonella henselae (25) pets have been identified as notable reservoirs for human infection, implying a potentially high risk of humans (25). pathogenic bartonella spp. are endotheliotropic bacteria with a distinctive mechanism for invasion into host cells involving the injection of peptides and transport of bacterial DNA into the cells. many antibiotics, including azithromycin, penicillin, tetracyclines, cephalosporins, and aminoglycosides, are effective against Bartonella infection (25, 26). endemic bacterium in many domestic and wild animals spreads through urine (28) and causes leptospirosis in both humans and animals, including livestock and marine mammals. 2,300 subtypes of the Salmonella enterica, including serovars Enteritidis, Agbeni, and Typhimurium, can cause asymptomatic, mild clinical, or fulminant bacteremia/septicemia. salmonella is an opportunistic pathogen that causes a wide range of infectious symptoms, including food poisoning, typhoid fever, enteric fever, and gastroenteritis. the collapse of gut microbial ecosystems due to antibiotics could cause undesired negative effects, such as altered physiology of the body or susceptibility to infectious diseases. the overuse and misuse of antibiotics are associated with both human and animal immune systems. herbal medicine interacts with the gut microbiome and alters metabolites, including short-chain fatty acids, bile acids, and lipopolysaccharides (35). in animals, self-medication remains a controversial subject because the evidence is mostly anecdotal (39) antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-fungal Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus (41\u201343) Diterpenes Essential oil from berries, traditional Chinese medicine (Euphorbiaceae, Lamiaceae, and Taxaceae family) Andrographolide (Andrographis paniculata), oridonin Antim phytochemicals, which are bioactive plant components with an amphipathic or hydrophobic structure, exhibit pharmacological effects on interaction with microbial membranes. phytochemicals, which are bioactive plant components with an amphipathic or hydrophobic structure, are known to exhibit pharmacological effects. plant compounds are responsible for a wide spectrum of pharmacological activities. terpenoids and phenolic compounds are the most commonly known antimicrobial plant components (51) terpenoids have exhibited cancer preventive effects and cytotoxic effects on tumor cells in preclinical animal models. ium graveolens is used as a flavoring agent and stimulant (63) and exhibits significant growth-inhibitory effects against S. aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and E. coli (43). the phenolic monoterpenes carvacrol and thymol are major components of the essential oils of Origanum and Thymus species. phytochemicals can be synergistically used with antibiotics to develop different antibacterial mechanisms or pathways to produce antimicrobial effects against S. aureus, B. cereus, and P. aeruginosa. triterpenes, including ursolic acids, exhibit antibacterial activity as adjuvants of aminoglycoside by changing membrane permeability and proton-motive force against Acinetobacter baumannii. cyanidins, delphinidin, flavone, luteolin, flavonols, myricetin, quercetin, rutin, and (\u2013)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate. flavonoids have a very broad spectrum of pharmacological activities. flavonoids have a very broad spectrum of pharmacological activities. phytomedicines, in particular Triticum aestivum L. and Theobroma cacao L., have been used in zoos to treat gastrointestinal pain and diarrhea in african elephants. the effective use of plant extracts with antimicrobial, antioxidant, and immune-boosting effects in combination with antibiotics can work synergistically and may provide a solution for management of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. further research should be performed to obtain more comprehensive knowledge of the use of phytochemicals as drugs in veterinary medicine. authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
