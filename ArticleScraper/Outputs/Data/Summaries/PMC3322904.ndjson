{"summary": "patient-care environment was inspected by a team of environmental engineers and industrial hygienists. laboratory specimens were obtained from healthcare workers with symptoms that fulfilled the SARS clinical case definition after exposure during the attempted cardiopulmonary resuscitation. the mother had recently been admitted to the same hospital and died of a nosocomial pneumonia after orthopedic surgery for a fractured hip. on admission, the patient was febrile and her chest radiograph showed left lower lobe and lingular infiltrates. both acute-phase serologic tests and serum RT-PCR were positive for SARS-CoV (National Microbiology Laboratory, Health Canada, Toronto) a bacterial/viral filter was placed on the bag-valve-mask after the intubation. healthcare worker exposures, personal protective equipment, and outcomea. all nurses in the room during the resuscitation were wearing protection equipment that was considered standard for routine SARS patient care at this hospital. the equipment consisted of two gowns, two sets of gloves, goggles, a full-face shield, shoe covers, hair cover, and N95 disposable respirators that were not fit-tested. both ICU-RN1 and ICU-RN2 had a temperature >38.0\u00b0C, myalgia, and malaise. RN3 reported a headache and myalgia on June 1, 2003, but her maximum temperature reached only 37.8\u00b0C. case report A 67-year-old woman with a history of asthma admitted to hospital. she had a 5 day history of fever, cough, malaise, headache, and myalgias. her mother had recently been admitted to the same hospital and died of a nosocomial pneumonia after orthopedic surgery for a fractured hip. tracheal intubation completed in 30 seconds. no suctioning was required during or after the intubation. no respiratory secretions or other bodily substances were observed. ator Myalgia, malaise, SOA, Tmax 38.5\u00b0C (May 31) Positive ICU RN3 Ventilated patient with bag-valve-mask (5\u201310 min) 5\u201310 min Gown x 2, gloves x 2, safety glasses, face shield, shoe cover, hair cover, N95 respirator None Negative RT1 Intubated patient (30 s), ventilated patient with bag-valve-mask (10\u201315 min) 10\u201315 min T4 both ICU-RN1 and ICU-RN2 had a temperature >38.0\u00b0C, myalgia, and malaise. ICU-RN1 complained of headache and nausea, and ICU-RN2 reported dyspnea. both RNs were admitted to the hospital for observation. this equates to a reduction factor (i.e., particles outside of the hood would be reduced in number by this factor) of 3.1 and 2.2 respectively. the similar symptom onset dates suggest a point source of exposure. this episode is unique in that the patient was neither conscious nor breathing at the time of the intubation. investigation of the epidemiology of nosocomial viral infections establishes the occurrence of airborne transmission. two explanations may account for the transmission observed in this case. an unrecognized breach in contact and droplet precautions occurred or an airborne viral load was great enough to overwhelm the protection offered by droplet precautions. policies that are too focused are of little value in dealing with the hundreds of unforeseeable possible situations that may arise. policies that educate healthcare workers to assess the risks of a task and empower them to take appropriate protective action will be more effective. first is to recognize that isolation wards cannot be staffed with the same nurse-to-patient ratio as a regular ward. policies should be developed to address appropriateness and application of advanced cardiac life support for patients suffering cardiopulmonary arrest on a SARS ward. many considerations must enter into any such discussion, including the usefulness and outcome of resuscitation efforts. staff must be trained in both the application of policies and the use of protection equipment. a higher level of respiratory protection should be considered in environments with a potentially very high SARS-CoV load. some hospitals in Ontario, canada, have adopted use of the T4 Personal Protective System (Stryker Instruments) disposable N95 is commonly worn under the T4 in Ontario hospitals. the powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) most commonly used in healthcare settings have a disposable full hood with face shield covering the healthcare worker\u2019s upper body. this device provides a higher level of protection against airborne infectious agents. one of the best ways to prevent healthcare worker infections is to ensure that no sustained transmission of SARS occurs within the patient population. the last step is to ensure ongoing adherence to the standards set by quality control. lapses in infection control procedures will occur as healthcare workers become fatigued during a prolonged outbreak. policies that are too focused are of little value in dealing with the hundreds of unforeseeable possible situations that may arise. policies that educate healthcare workers to assess the risks of a task and empower them to take appropriate protective action will be more effective. first is to recognize that isolation wards cannot be staffed with the same nurse-to-patient ratio as a regular ward. policies should be developed to address appropriateness and application of advanced cardiac life support for patients suffering cardiopulmonary arrest on a SARS ward. many considerations must enter into any such discussion, including the usefulness and outcome of resuscitation efforts. staff must be trained in both the application of policies and the use of protection equipment. a higher level of respiratory protection should be considered in environments with a potentially very high SARS-CoV load. some hospitals in Ontario, Canada, have adopted use of the T4 Personal Protective System (Stryker Instruments) disposable N95 is commonly worn under the T4 used in Ontario hospitals. the powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) most commonly used in healthcare settings have a disposable full hood with face shield covering the healthcare worker\u2019s upper body. ensuring that a hospital has adequate protection against airborne diseases, even if not absolutely required for SARS. one of the best ways to prevent healthcare worker infections is to ensure that no sustained transmission of SARS occurs within the patient population. the last step is to ensure ongoing adherence to the standards set. lapses in infection control procedures will occur as healthcare workers become fatigued during a prolonged outbreak."}
