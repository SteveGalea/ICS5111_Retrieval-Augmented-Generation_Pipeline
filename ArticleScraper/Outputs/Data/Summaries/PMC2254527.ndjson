{"summary": "SARS-CoV is a positive-stranded RNA virus with an envelop. the genome of SARS-CoV is around 29,727 nucleotides in length. the sequence was annotatedin silico [10]. al S2 domain (residues 12\u2013672) binds to the host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), while the S2 domain is responsible for membrane fusion [13\u201315]. monoclonal antibodies against S1 domain can block the receptor binding and contain potent neutralization activity against SARS-CoV infection [12]. Molecular mimicry is defined as similar structures shared by molecules from dissimilar genes or by their protein products. the reported accuracy of the method is about 75% [18] in silico secondary structural analyses of spike protein were performed based on PHD [19] and PREDATOR [20] algorithms. similarity searches between S protein and human genome database were performed by using BLASTP [23] with BLOSUM 62. ELISA plate was coated with or without 50 L peptides (100 g/mL) per well and blocked by 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in 0.05% Tween-20 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 1 hour at room temperature. antibody was detected by horseradish peroxidase- conjugated antihuman immunoglobulin antibodies. synthetic peptides (1 mg/mL) were emulsified with complete Freund's adjuvant. mice were boosted with the same peptide in PBS (50 g/mouse) intraperitoneally. antibody titer (greater than 4 folds) against immunized-peptide was found. cell proliferation was detected using commercial XTT assay. IL-8 production was assessed by commercial ELISA kits. protein topology prediction was based on the algorithm developed by TMHMM [21] similarity searches were performed by using BLASTP [23] with BLOSUM 62. extra amino acid residues were added at either N- or C-terminus. ered saline (PBS) for 1 hour at room temperature. antibody was washed with 0.05% Tween-20 in PBS for 3 times. antibody was detected by horseradish peroxidase- conjugated antihuman immunoglobulin antibodies (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo, USA) mice were boosted with the same peptide in PBS (50 g/mouse) intraperitoneally. antibody titer (greater than 4 folds) against immunized-peptide was found in mouse hyperimmune sera compared to normal sera after boosting. A549 cells were cultured alone or with different doses of peptides for 48 hours. plates were washed four times with the washing buffer. bound IL-8 was detected by HRP-conjugated antibodies and substrate. residues 490\u2013502 (GYQPYRVVVVLSFEE) of S protein showed sequence homology with bradykinin (RPPGFSPFR) and Ang I (DRVYIHPFHL) the identity score is 27%; the similarity score from conservative substitutions is 36%. the designed peptide sequences were synthesized and tested with clinical samples of SARS patient sera. the peptides were designed based on algorithms predicting immunogenicity, second structure, protein topology, and hydrophobicity. sera of SARS patients at convalescent stage as well as normal controls were collected as described in Section 2. antibodies binding to different peptides were detected by ELISA as described in Section 2. hyperimmune sera against D08 crossreacted with human proteins. significant increase of antibodies against D10 was found in D10 hyperimmune sera. hyperimmune sera could crossreact with bradykinin, but not with Ang I-coated plates. crossreactivity of D10 antibody with bradykinin and Ang I was found. Ang I. A549 cells were incubated with or without peptides for 48 hours. the levels of IL-8 in the culture supernatants were assayed. data represents the mean SD of triplicates. regions shared sequence homology with human proteins, blue regions. purple regions are both immunogenic and pathogenic regions. grey region is the leader sequence and brown region is transmembrane. peptides D01, D07, and D08 were found as compared to the binding of normal sera. ELISA immunized mice with these peptides to generate hyperimmune sera against D08. hyperimmune sera against D08 could recognize more bands in A549 cell lysate compared to normal mice sera. hyperimmune sera against D07, but not D01, showed similar crossreactivity to A549 cells as hyperimmune sera against D08 did. Peptide D10 induced IL-8 secretion and cell proliferation of A549 cells. both Vero and A549 cells were induced to proliferate in the presence of D10 and Ang I but not the control peptide. murine hyperimmune sera against peptides D07 or D08 were able to bind to recombinant S2 but not S1 domain of S protein. hyperimmune sera against peptides D07 or D08 also bounded to the cytoplasmic region of A549 cells and recognized several proteins in the A549 cell lysate. this results indicate that regions represented by D07 and D08 are immunogenic and may induce autoantibodies. further molecular mimicry occurs between SARS-CoV and host proteins. motifs shared sequence homology with host proteins of SARS-COV may be involved in binding and fusion of SARS-CoV to host cells."}
