{"summary": "the Asia-Pacific has developed at a surprising rate, leading to a meteoric rise in its diplomatic, strategic, and economic importance. the region's sheer size, stretching from the Indian subcontinent to the western shores of the Americas, makes it strategically important to America's future. inequities in nutrition and access to health care have negatively affected life expectancy and workforce productivity in some areas. increased energy demand, mounting nuclear issues, and transnational and nonstate terrorist movements threaten security and prosperity. the average number of people exposed to flooding in the Asia-Pacific more than doubled, from 29.5 million to 63.8 million. more than 15,800 people in the region died, and 340,000 were displaced. the world was not prepared for this event, and the international response and integration with the Japanese authorities fell short. forecasts suggest that Southeast Asia will continue to be disproportionately affected by severe climate events. new and reemerging diseases have spread by the increasing density of populations and unregulated animal markets. many of the world's decision makers have been critically slow in recognizing the increasing impact the region has in the proliferation of infectious diseases. pesticides, fertilizers from agricultural runoff, industrial chemicals, and human and animal waste have altered the downstream microorganism ecology. this has led to an unprecedented, complex, and burgeoning pool of new and resistant microorganisms, a public health risk impossible to reverse. emerging infectious diseases emanating from the Asia-Pacific region include avian influenza A/H5N1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Nipah virus. health can infringe upon a nation's ability to defend and provide for itself. public health can be severely affected by disruptions to security and the economy. extreme weather events and a spectrum of regional instability reinforce the importance of preventing epidemics. the vast majority of their spending is in Africa and the Middle East, with 70% going into operations that have been going on for at least 5 years. the international humanitarian aid system is designed to respond to big wars, refugees, or famine28 (Figure 1). of the top 10 recipients of humanitarian cash transfer programs from 2008 through 2012, only 2 countries were in the Asia-Pacific region. western NGOs are rural, not urban, in focus, yet the future of Asia is urban. the continent is urbanizing at a rapid rate, but public health infrastructure and approaches are not keeping pace. traditional western-based NGOs do not have relief plans for urban settings. education efforts in North America, the United Kingdom, the European Union, and Australia have been initiated from both academic and nation-state resources. education efforts in north America, the United Kingdom, the European Union, and Australia have been initiated from both academic and nation-state resources, but on a limited basis. the need and potential for growth in the Asia-Pacific is strong, but the common thread of multidisciplinary complex public health emergencies demands that professionalization be introduced early. this is especially true in nation-states where indigenous government public health capacity and disaster preparedness competencies are still evolving. the Hyogo Framework for Action was undertaken in an ambitious effort to improve the integration of disaster reduction into sustainable development policies and planning. this includes a UN strategy for developing a Pacific regional disaster risk reduction framework to prevent or mitigate threats to the public's health. this includes a global authority, required for all large-scale disasters and crises, does not exist. crisis and disaster risk reduction begins and ends at the local level. concept recognizes that individual communities are both unique and discrete in better understanding what individual risks they live with and what the impact would be of any disaster on both their communities and their needs. many traditionally grounded professionals remain averse to accelerating solutions outside their favored discipline. many traditionally grounded professionals remain averse to accelerating solutions outside their favored discipline. many traditionally grounded professionals remain averse to accelerating solutions outside their favored discipline."}
