{"summary": "polyalanine (poly(A) diseases are caused by the expansion of GCN (where N refers to any of the four bases) trinucleotide repeats in the disease genes encoding the poly(A) amino acid tract in the disease proteins (1, 2). Expansion of alanine tracts has been shown to cause several human pathological conditions. the longer a poly(A) tract appended to the disease protein is, the lower the trans-activation activity of FOXL2 (9) the longer a poly(A) tract is, the lower the trans-activation activity of FOXL2. eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 (eEF1A)3 is involved in the nuclear export of proteins. eEF1A1 regulates the localization of protein that carries a novel nuclear export signal (NES) in a poly(A) tract of disease proteins implicated in poly(A) disorders. our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for how transcription factor dysregulation is triggered in poly(A) pathogenesis. the Rev(1.4)-A6-EGFP protein was found in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. this result suggests that the expanded poly(A) tract alters the localization of nuclear proteins, directing them to the cytoplasm. the Rev(1.4)-poly(A)-EGFP protein with a 6-alanine tract (A6) localized in the nuclear compartment. that with a 37-alanine tract Rev(1.4)-A37-EGFP (A37) showed both nuclear and cytoplasmic localization. EGFP and pRev(1.4)-A7PA6PA6PA6PA6PA6PA6PA6-EGFP contain three or five proline residues within the expanded 37 poly(A) tract. as a result, the continuity of the expanded poly(A) tract is disrupted, and the long poly(A) tracts are split into shorter alanine stretches. this indicates that the continuity of expanded poly(A) tract is crucial for its effect of cytoplasmic the threshold repeat length that would lead to nuclear + cytoplasmic localization in the majority of cells lies between 28 and 31 repeats. eEF1A1 interacted with protein carrying an expanded poly(A) tract but not with the unexpanded poly(A) tract. GST-pulldown assay was performed to determine interaction between endogenous eEF1A1 and GST-poly(A) the eluents were detected by Western blotting using anti-eEF1A antibody. the eluents were detected by Western blotting using anti-eEF1A antibody. c agarose affinity gel followed by immunoblotting with mouse anti-Myc antibody (Myc-eEF1A1) and mouse anti-GFP antibody (Rev(1.4)-poly(A)-EGFP) the interaction with eEF1A1 was abolished when continuity of the expanded poly(A) tract was disrupted by proline. eEF1A1 regulates the cytoplasmic localization of expanded poly(A) tract-containing protein eEF1A is a GTP-binding protein that associates with protein synthesis (23). eEF1A1 regulates the cytoplasmic localization of expanded poly(A) tract-containing protein eEF1A is a protein that associates with protein synthesis (23) the knockdown of eEF1A1 has no effect on changing the N/C ratio. the efficiency of the eEF1A1 siRNA was analyzed by immunoblotting. results also showed that overexpression of eEF1A1 enhanced the cytoplasmic localization of expanded poly(A) protein. Knockdown of eEF1A1 expression caused a statistically significant increase in the percentage of cells expressing Rev(1.4)-A37-EGFP protein with an N/C ratio of >1. overexpression of Myc-eEF1A1 caused Rev(1.4)-A37-EGFP protein cytoplasmic enrichment but had no effect on localization of Rev(1.4)-A6-EGFP protein. knockdown of eEF2 expression did not change the percentage of cells expressing Rev(1.4)-poly(A)-EGFP protein with N/C ratio >1. eEF1A1 knockdown-mediated nuclear enrichment of expanded poly(A) proteins results from a blockage of general protein translation elongation. a mutation in SOX3 causing the addition of extra 7\u201311 alanine residues to normal 15-alanine tract induces X-linked hypopituitarism. the protein plays a critical role in embryogenesis, including the formation of neuroblasts (26, 27) and axonal patterning (28). eEF1A1 mediates expanded poly(A) domain-containing SoxN nucleocytoplasmic distribution but does not alter wild-type SoxN localization. Knockdown of eEF1A1 expression caused nuclear enrichment of A34-SoxN-EGFP protein but had no effect on subcellular localization of A12-SoxN-EGFP protein. images of external eyes were taken from 2 days post-eclosion flies. transcript levels of poly(A)-SoxN and Ef1a48D were detected using RT-PCR. the overexpression of A34-SoxN resulted in abnormal eyes, characterized by a rough surface due to the disturbance of ommatidia architecture. the overexpression of A12-SoxN did not display any effect on the external eye morphology, nor did the GAL4 driver control. depletion of Ef1a48D by gene knockdown rescued the external eye rough surface phenotype caused by A34-SoxN. se reporter assay measures the regulation of gene expression mediated by the GAL4 transcription activator fused with either an unexpanded or expanded poly(A) tract. the pFR-Luc plasmid contains a promoter with five tandem repeats of the GAL4 binding sites that control the expression of the firefly luciferase gene. eEF1A1 knockdown partially corrected cytoplasmic mislocalization of expanded poly(A) tract-containing protein. reduction of firefly luciferase transcription level in expanded poly(A) tract-containing protein was partially restored upon eEF1A1 knockdown. a small region of interest (ROI) of the target cell was repeatedly photobleached using a high-power 488-nm laser and followed by an immediate postbleach capture using a low-power 488-nm laser. the Rev(1.4) possesses only nuclear import activities but lacks nuclear export activities. if expanded poly(A) tract mediates nuclear export activities then the nuclear export of the reporter protein would result in the dilution of the remaining fluorescence in the nuclear compartment fluorescence intensity of A37 protein was observed postbleach compared with the control protein (A6). at least 14 transfected cells from three independent transfection experiments were analyzed. at least 100 transfected cells were measured per experiment. eEF1A1 is mediator of expanded poly(A) tract-induced nuclear export. eEF1A1 was found to localize to the nucleus, whereas eEF1A1-NES localized to the cytoplasm. eEF1A1 mediates cytoplasmic localization of poly(A)-containing proteins. cytoplasmic eEF1A1 may also mediate cytoplasmic retention of poly(A)-containing proteins. eEF1A1 plays dual roles in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm to mediate the cytoplasmic mislocalization of proteins with an expanded poly(A) tract. cytoplasmic eEF1A1 may also participate in cytoplasmic retention of poly(A)-containing proteins. a poly(A) tract (control) was found to predominantly localize to the nuclear compartment (Fig. 1, A and B) the Rev(1.4)-NES-EGFP protein was used as the positive control to show that the insertion of a functional NES from the HIV-1 Rev protein (21) caused cytoplasmic localization of the nuclear export reporter protein. Rev(1.4)-poly(A)-EGFP protein localized to the nuclear compartment. positive control Rev(1.4)-NES-EGFP (NES) localized to the cytoplasm. cell nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342. independent transfection experiments were performed. at least 100 transfected cells were analyzed in each experiment. the continuity of expanded poly(A) tract is disrupted. 26% of cells with pure nuclear localization showed both nuclear and cytoplasmic localization. eEF1A1 interacted with Myc-eEF1A1 by a GST-pulldown experiment in HEK293 cells. the endogenous eEF1A protein interacted with Myc-eEF1A1. eEF1A1 interacted specifically with protein carrying an expanded poly(A) tract. eEF1A1 interacted with GST-poly(A) but not with the unexpanded poly(A) tract. lysates of cells co-transfected with pRev(1.4)-poly(A)-EGFP and pcDNA3.1-myc-eEF1A1 constructs were subjected to a co-IP assay. IP was performed with c-Myc agarose affinity gel followed by immunoblotting with mouse anti-Myc antibody (Myc-eEF1A1) and mouse anti-GFP antibody (Rev(1.4)-poly(A) eEF1A1 regulates the cytoplasmic localization of expanded poly(A) tract-containing protein eEF1A is a GTP-binding protein that associates with protein synthesis. eEF1A1 regulates the cytoplasmic localization of expanded poly(A) tract-containing protein eEF1A. knockdown of eEF1A1 expression caused enrichment of the Rev(1.4)-A37-EGFP protein in the nuclear compartment. knockdown of eEF1A1 has no effect on changing the N/C ratio. eEF1A1 protein levels were reduced after eEF1A1 siRNA treatment. down of eEF1A1 expression caused a nuclear enrichment of Rev(1.4)-A37-EGFP protein but had no effect on localization of Rev(1.4)-A6-EGFP protein. the cell nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33432. knockdown of eEF2 expression did not change the percentage of cells expressing Rev(1.4)-poly(A)-EGFP protein with N/C ratio >1. knockdown efficiency of eEF2 was measured using immunoblotting. at least 100 transfected cells were measured per experiment. the human sex-determining region Y-box 3 (SOX3) protein is a transcription factor that is expressed in the brain and plays a role in neural development (1). a mutation in SOX3 causing the addition of an extra 7\u201311 alanine residues to normal 15-alanine tract induces X-linked hypopituitarism. overlapping was observed in cells treated with control siRNA and eEF1A1 siRNA. overlapping was partially restored upon eEF1A1 knockdown. nucleocytoplasmic fractionation assay performed. Knockdown of Ef1a48D rescued the eye phenotype induced by expanded poly(A) SoxN. the images of external eyes were taken from 2 days post-eclosion flies. transgenic fly lines, UAS-A12-SoxN and UAS-A34-SoxN consist of the SoxN gene with a 12-alanine tract or a 34-alanine tract. Gmr-GAL4 driver was used to overexpress A12-SoxN in the fly eye, and the external eye phenotypes were examined. the overexpression of A34-SoxN resulted in abnormal eyes, characterized by a rough surface due eEF1A1 partially restores the transcription function of poly(A)-containing protein Eight of nine poly(A) disease genes encode for transcription factors. luciferase reporter assay measures the regulation of gene expression mediated by the GAL4 transcription activator fused with either unexpanded or expanded poly(A) tract. eEF1A1 knockdown partially corrected cytoplasmic mislocalization of expanded poly(A) tract-containing protein. reduction of firefly luciferase transcription level in expanded poly(A) tract-containing transcription factor was partially restored upon eEF1A1 knockdown. expanded poly(A) tract possesses nuclear export activity mediated by nuclear eEF1A1. expanded poly(A) tract possesses nuclear export activity mediated by nuclear eEF1A1. ER-Tracker Red was used as a cytoplasmic marker (gray channel) eEF1A1 was exported to the cytoplasm starting at 1 min postactivation. eEF1A1 was cytoplasmic, but eEF1A1 was detected in the nucleus. both constructs resulted in increased cytoplasmic localization of Rev(1.4)-A37-EGFP protein. the cell nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33432. at least 100 transfected cells were measured per experiment. eEF1A1 is a mediator of expanded poly(A) tract-induced nuclear export. it should be present in the nucleus to interact with the poly(A) tract. however, there is a need to verify the presence of eEF1A1 in the nucleus. nuclear eEF1A1 mediates nuclear export of poly(A)-containing proteins. cytoplasmic eEF1A1 may also mediate cytoplasmic retention of poly(A)-containing proteins. eEF1A1 plays dual roles in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. the expanded poly(A) tract is sufficient to confer cytoplasmic localization to a YFP reporter protein (12). eEF1A1 is an expanded poly(A) protein-interacting partner that binds specifically to the expanded poly(A) sequences (Fig. 2, A and B) eEF1A1 is a poly(A)-containing protein's interaction with eEF1A1. this interaction is a major determinant of the poly(A)-containing protein's mislocalization in the cytoplasm. previous mammalian studies have demonstrated eEF1A as a novel component of the nuclear protein export machinery. the knockdown of eEF1A1 expression did not affect the transcript and protein levels of poly(A)-containing proteins. however, the knockdown of eEF1A1 expression did not affect the transcript and protein levels of poly(A)-containing proteins. the expanded poly(A) tract can function as a novel NES. nuclear export assay allows a continuous monitoring of nucleocytoplasmic trafficking. it illustrates the nuclear export event of expanded poly(A) protein in living cells. the classical NES is a hydrophobic leucine-rich sequence. the knockdown of eEF1A1 does not alter classical NES-mediated nuclear export. both XPO1-dependent and XPO1-independent pathways contribute to the nucleus export of constitutive androstane receptor. calreticulin plays a role as a chaperone (49), although it harbors only an XPO1-independent NES (50\u201352). candidate gene siRNA knockdown approach identified other molecules that may regulate the nucleus export of poly(A)-containing proteins. eEF1A1429\u2013449 is responsible for translocating the peptidyl-tRNA to the A site of the ribosome. knockdown of eEF2 does not affect subcellular localization of Rev(1.4)-A37-EGFP protein. cytoplasmic localization of expanded poly(A) protein was not due to blockage of general protein translation. overexpression of A34-SoxN-EGFP results in the formation of aggregates in the cytoplasm in SK-N-MC cells. the knockdown of eEF1A1 does not induce changes in the transcript level of binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP), a chaperone protein that regulates protein folding. this indicates that the regulation of subcellular localization of poly(A) expansion proteins by eEF1A1 is not related to protein misfolding. siRNA-silencing eEF1A1 rescues transcriptional activity of GAL4-A37-FLAG. knockdown of eEF1A1 partially restores cellular function of poly(A)-containing transcription factors. it has recently been reported that the expanded poly(A) PHOX2B disease protein adopts a cytoplasmic localization. expanded poly(A) tract is a NES, signaling the export of expanded poly(A) proteins from the nucleus to the cytoplasm with the assistance of nuclear eEF1A1. eEF1A1 may be involved in the cytoplasmic retention of expanded poly(A) proteins, which aggregate and exert toxic effects. oligo_A22_F (5\u2032-GAT CCA GCA GCT GCT GCT GCT GCT GCT GCT GCT GCT GCT GCT GCT GCT GCT GCT GCT GCT GCT GCT GCT GCT GCT GCT GCT GCT GCT GCT GCT GCT GCT GCT GCT GCT GCT GCT GCT GCT GCT GCT GCT GCT GCT GCT GCT GCT GCT GCT GCT oligo_A28_R (5\u2032-CCG GTG GAG CTG CTG CGG CGG CGG CGG CGG CGG CGG CGG CGG CGG CGG CGG CGG CGG CGG CGG CGG CGG CGG CGG CGG CGG CGG CGG CGG CGG CGG CGG CGG CTG CTG CTG CTG CTG CTG CTG CTG CTG CTG CTG CTG CTG CTG CTG CTG CTG pRev(1.4)-poly(A)-PAGFP, Rev(1.4)-poly(A) (A6 and A37) fragments were subcloned from pRev(1.4)-poly(A)-EGFP to pPAGFP-N1 vector (32) using EcoRI and AgeI enzymes. pRev(1.4)-EGFP and pRev(1.4)-NES-EGFP constructs were gifts from Professor beric Henderson (Westmead Institute for Cancer Research, University of Sydney, Westmead, Australia) the pRev(1.4)-EGFP and pRev(1.4)-NES-EGFP constructs were gifts from Professor beric Henderson (Westmead Institute for Cancer Research, University of Sydney, westmead, Australia) cell culture and transfection HEK293 and SK-N-MC cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. cells were seeded at a density of 0.8 105 cells/24-well plate. for transfection experiments, cells were seeded at a density of 0.8 105 cells/24-well plate. cells and flies were extracted using TRIzol\u00ae reagent (Invitrogen) RT-PCR was performed according to manufacturer's instructions.
