{"summary": "a large-scale study on the prevalence of viral infections has not been previously reported from china. we included 28,369 ALRI patients from 81 sentinel hospitals in 22 (of the 24) provinces. the most frequently detected virus was RSV (9.9%), followed by influenza (6.6%), PIV (4.8%), ADV (3.4%), hBoV (1.9), hMPV (1.5%) and hCoV (1.4%). influenza vaccination should be implemented on a wider scale in china. the incidence of ALRIs in children aged less than 5 years is estimated to be 0.22 episodes per child-year. in china, ALRIs were the most frequent cause of child mortality in 2008. large-scale study aimed to identify the viral etiologies associated with ALRIs from patients across 22 provinces of china between 2009\u20132013. a patient was considered having ALRI if they had: measured fever (38\u00b0C), abnormal white blood cell differential, leukocytosis (a WBC count more than 10,000/L) or leukopenia (a WBC count more than 10,000/L) Specimen collection and testing Each week or month, the first 2\u20135 ALRI patients were enrolled for specimen collection in each sentinel hospital. cases were screened weekly in 49 hospitals and monthly in the other 59 hospitals. polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or real-time PCR were performed to detect ADV and hBoV. reverse transcriptase- PCR (RT-PCR) or real-time RT-PCR were performed to detect the other five viral agents as described previously. analysis was performed with SPSS (v18.0, SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) two tailed Mann-Whitney tests were used for multiple comparisons of median age between patients positive and patients negative for different viruses. P0.05 was considered statistically significant. Specimen collection and testing Each week or month, the first 2\u20135 ALRI patients were enrolled for specimen collection in each sentinel hospital. cases were screened weekly in 49 hospitals and monthly in the other 59 hospitals. fluenza virus (PIV), hMPV, hCoV and hBoV was directly extracted from respiratory specimens using commercial kits. polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or real-time PCR were performed to detect ADV and hBoV. reverse transcriptase-PCR or real-time RT-PCR were performed to detect the other five viral agents. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS (v18.0, SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) two tailed Mann-Whitney tests were used for multiple comparisons of median age between patients positive and patients negative for different viruses. 81 hospitals in 22 provinces participate in acute lower respiratory infection surveillance for final analysis. the box indicates Spratly Islands in southern china sea. 45 (11.5) 425 (20.9) 1652 (9.2) 12\u201323 months 3337 (11.8) 1627 (15.7) 422 (15.1) 199 (10.6) 202 (14.8) 168 (17.6) 137 (24.9) 69 (16.3) 47 (12) 383 (18.8) 1710 (9.5) 2\u20134 years 5159 (18.2) 2206 (21.2) 484 (17.3) 446 (23.9) 265 (19.4) 288 (30.1) 116 (21.1) 141 (3 511 (28.2) 219/381 (57.5) 152/360 (42.2) 645/1912 (33.7) 7531/16847 (44.7) Cough 22364 (78.8) 8816 (84.9) 2466 (88.2) 1567 (83.8) 1134 (83) 756 (79.6) 457 (82.9) 365 (86.1) 313 (79.6) 1758 (86.5) 13548 (75.3) Runny nose 5350 (18.9) 2282 (22) 709 data is presented as no.
