{"summary": "adjuvant formulations have been shown to enhance desirable immune responses. the ability of adjuvants to direct the immune response to immunogens suggests they will be critically important in a successful AIDS vaccine. a number of excellent reviews have been published [1,2,3,4\u20138] that the reader may find useful. the development of adjuvants has accelerated in the last 25 years and has to some degree paralleled the development of HIV-1 vaccine candidates. vaccine studies focused on leveraging strategies that had been successful for other vaccines including virus inactivation [12\u201314] and subunit immunogens [15], along with novel strategies such as recombinant viral constructs [17,18]. no clearly superior regimen was identified, likely because of the lack of a consistent immunogen across trials. Freund's complete adjuvant with a recombinant gp160 as the immunogen were highest with Freund's complete adjuvant and MDP. many mouse studies were published and nearly all demonstrated that one adjuvant was superior. Vaccine candidates deemed the most promising advanced to phase I and phase II human trials. without a stronger candidate available, a controversial decision was made to pursue a phase III trial of poxvirus prime-gp120 boost vaccine strategy. studies are being considered to examine the same immunization regimen using more potent adjuvants to see whether protection can be enhanced or prolonged. the remainder of this review will address more recent developments in adjuvant research. electrical current as an adjuvant has been tested in mice [55], rhesus macaques [56,57], and humans [58] electroporation alone is as effective as DNA-encoded adjuvants, although side-effects were higher in electroporation groups. further testing will be needed to determine whether electroporation can be implemented so as to reduce side-effects yet remain effective. tethering of liposomes to a poxvirus vector overcame previous immunity. many adjuvants, such as oil-in-water emulsions, can disrupt lipid membranes. it is not clear that an adjuvant that is only transiently present at the site of injection would be useful. one adjuvant in this series, AS01B, elicited high-titered antibodies in rhesus macaques [69] and was also used in a human HIV-1 clinical trial. another adjuvant in that series, AS02A, also elicited immune responses in humans [71] but which of the adjuvants in this series is best for an HIV-1 vaccine is not yet established. a protein derived from the worm Onchocerca volvulus enhanced antibody responses in mice [76]. a protein derived from the worm Onchocerca volvulus enhanced antibody responses in mice [76]. cholera toxin (CT) and other bacterial products have been extensively tested in animal models. CT combined with Env gp120 elicited mucosal IgA in rhesus macaques. cytokines were able to elicit mucosal antibodies to a peptide immunogen when given to cynomolgus monkeys. intranasal cytokines appear to be as effective as CT in eliciting mucosal antibodies in mice [85]. a study in rabbits using an oil-in-water emulsion for the prime and alum showed that antibody responses were highest with the mixed regimen. the regimen could be used to overcome the undesirable side effects of strongly adjuvanted vaccines by using less reactive adjuvants in subsequent steps. vaccines should be well tolerated for the general population and ideally cause no side-effects to anyone. as preventive measures, vaccines should be well tolerated for the general population and ideally cause no side-effects.
