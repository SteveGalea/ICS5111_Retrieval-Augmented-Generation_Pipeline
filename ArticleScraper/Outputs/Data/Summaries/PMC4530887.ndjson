{"summary": "the disease is caused by dengue virus (DENV) belonging to the Flaviviridae family. it also includes several other human pathogens such as the west Nile virus, japan encephalitis virus, and yellow fever virus. despite intense studies, currently there are neither vaccines nor other treatments available to treat this disease. flavivirus proteases including dengue protease require a stretch of approximately 40 amino acids from the cytosolic domain of NS2B for catalytic activity. unlike other proteases with a chymotrypsin-like fold, the protease domain requires a stretch of approximately 40 amino acids from the cytosolic domain of NS2B for catalytic activity, thus called two-component protease [6\u20138]. d NS3pro spontaneously folds into the well-structured and active enzyme. a truncated NS2B is able to form a buffer-soluble complex with NS3pro. a truncated NS2B is able to form a buffer-soluble complex with NS3pro. fragments for NS3 (14\u2013185), NS2B (1\u2013130) and NS2B (48\u2013100;77\u201384) were cloned into pGEX-4T1 vector with GST-tag (GE healthcare) using NcoI and XhoI restriction sites. DNA sequences of cloned constructs were verified by automated DNA sequencing. the NS2B (1\u2013130) and NS3pro proteins were completely insoluble. they were solubilized with PBS buffer (pH7.4) containing 8 M urea. cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 40000g. activity of the isolated NS3pro and refolded NS2B-NS3pro was measured in the assay buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.001% Triton X-100, 0.5 mM EGTA, or 100 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.0) in the 100 l reaction mixtures containing 0.3 M protease, 20 M protease specific fluorophore-tagged three single-cysteine mutants were prepared: Q27C, E86C, S158C by use of the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) as previously described. mutated plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing and their recombinant proteins were expressed and purified by the same procedures described above. the purity of the MTSSL-modified proteins of all mutants was > 99% after the HPLC purification. the NS2B, NS3pro and NS2B-NS3pro samples were prepared at a protein concentration of 20 M in either Milli-Q water (pH 4.0). 1H-15N steady-state NOEs were obtained by recording spectra on the 15N-labeled NS3pro domain at 500 M in either milli-Q water (pH 4.0), with and without 1H presaturation with duration of 3 s plus a relaxation delay of 6 s at 800 MHz. NH, N, C and C chemical shifts of the isolated NS3pro in water at pH 4.0 were further analyzed by both delta2D [26] to der NS2B residues Thr77-Met84 are missing in the crystal structure. these residues were added and the obtained structure was post-processed. three independent 20-ns simulations for either NS2B-NS3pro complex or NS3pro alone were performed. MutInf represents an entropy-based approach to analyze ensembles of protein conformers. this approach is even applicable for detecting conformational changes which are subtle in the short MD simulations because the coupling is mostly entropic in nature. NS2B (48\u2013100;77\u201384) with Thr77-Met84 replaced by three Gly residues were cloned into pGEX-4T1 vector with GST-tag. DNA sequences of cloned constructs were verified by automated DNA sequencing. cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 40000g. supernatant containing His-tagged NS2B (1\u2013130) and NS3pro were purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. reaction mixtures contain 0.3 M protease, 20 M protease specific fluorophore-tagged substrate benzoyl-Nle-Lys-Arg-Arg-aminomethylcoumarin. reaction mixtures were incubated at 37\u00b0C and the liberated coumarin fluorophore was continuously monitored. 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectroscopy (HSQC) experiments were performed on each mutant to validate that these mutations did not significantly perturb the native NS3pro sequence. the recombinant proteins of three single-cysteine mutants were Cys-modified following the previous procedure [18] by the thiol-reactive nitroxide free radical probe, MTSSL (1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-3- the NS2B, NS3pro and NS2B-NS3pro samples were prepared at a protein concentration of 20 M in either Milli-Q water (pH 4.0) and 1 mM phosphate (pH 7.5) respectively. all NMR experiments were acquired on an 800 MHz Bruker Avance spectrometer equipped with pulse field gradient units. NH, N, C and C chemical shifts of the isolated NS3pro in water at pH 4.0 were further analyzed by both delta2D [26] to derive the secondary structure population. HSQC spectra were acquired for 3 corresponding cysteine mutants without spin-labelling at the same conditions. three independent 20-ns MD simulations for either NS2B-NS3pro complex or NS3pro alone were performed with the program GROMACS [27] with the AMBER-03 [28] all-atom force field. temperature during the simulations was kept constant at 300 K by Berendsen's coupling. 0.3 was set up to be the threshold value to determine the pairs of highly correlated residues. residue pairs with correlated values 0.3 make up top 1% of the entire matrix. recombinant NS3pro protein found to be completely insoluble. NS3pro has very similar far-UV CD spectra in milli-Q water (pH 4.0) and 5 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) this indicates that the isolated NS3pro domain is highly disordered in aqueous solution. this indicates that the isolated NS3pro consists of 53% random coil, 14% turn, 29% extended strand and 4% helix secondary structures. values of NS3pro in the isolated state obtained in the present study (red) and in the complex with NS2B (grey) previously published (10). NS2B (48\u2013100) contains 32% random coil, 24% turn, 7% extended strand and 37% helix secondary structures. HSQC peaks of the isolated NS2B (48\u2013100) are much more broadened than those of NS3pro. despite narrow spectral dispersions, we have successfully assigned NMR resonances of almost all non-proline residues of the NS3pro (14\u2013185) isolated NS3pro residues have the absolute values of (C-C) 2 ppm. the isolated NS3pro adopts highly-populated random coil conformations over the whole sequence. however, over some short segments, the extended strand conformation is also populated. isolated NS3pro has largely unrestricted backbone motions on the ps-ns time scale. residues over Ile65-Leu100 have relatively large hNOE. three single Cys mutants were subsequently labelled with the nitroxide free radical probe, MTSSL whose PRE were measured by HSQC. the residues which were significant affected are all located in the first -barrel of the chymotrypsin fold adopted by the NS3pro domain in the native NS2B-NS3pro complex. the isolated NS3pro domain is not completely extended, but rather has a loose tertiary packing. the residues over the middle region of the NS3pro sequence are slightly less dynamic than the N- and C-terminal ones. the isolated NS3pro (14\u2013185) and NS2B (48\u2013100) are largely disordered in solution. 2B refolded NS2B (48\u2013100)-NS3pro complex at a molar ratio of 1:1 at milli-Q water at pH 4.0 (blue) and at 7.5 (red) as measured in the assay buffer (pH 7.5) HSQC spectrum of the isolated NS3pro (blue) and NS2B-NS3pro mixture (red) in buffer (pH 7.5) refolded NS2B-NS3pro complex at pH 4.0 and 7.5 has a HSQC spectrum. the complex at pH 7.5 has a HSQC spectrum typical of a well-folded protein. a large portion of the HSQC peaks of the present NS3pro domain are almost superimposable to those of the previous complex. the enzymatic parameters of the refolded NS2B-NS3pro complex in the buffer at pH 7.5 were obtained with Km = 92.39 9.94 M and Kcat = 0.15 0.01 s-1. the structure and enzymatic activity revealed that once NS2B and NS3pro meet, they will bind to each other and initiate the folding process to form the two-component complex. full-length NS2B (1\u2013130) was reconstituted in the LMPC micelle at a molar ratio of 1:200 (NS2B:LMPC) in buffer (pH 7.5) NS3pro and NS2B (1\u2013130) were also refolded together at the equimolar concentrations in presence of LMPC in buffer. the observed line-broadening cannot mainly result from the increased molecular weight in the LMPC micelle. more narrow peaks for almost all residues could be detected for the helical superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1). the far-UV CD spectrum of the complex between NS2B (1\u2013130) and NS3pro in the LMPC micelle has the maximum negative signal at 206 nm and positive signal at 190 nm. the deconvolution shows that its secondary structure contents are very similar to those of the complex between NS2B (48\u2013100) and NS3pro in buffer, only with 3% increase of -strand conformation and 1.6% reduction of the helix conformation. some HSQC peaks of the NS3pro domain complexed with the NS2B (1\u2013130) in the LMPC micelle are not superimposable to those in the NS2B (40\u2013100)-NS3pro complex. this implies that these residues may have different structures, or/and dynamics, or/and chemical environments in the NS2B (40\u2013100)-NS3pro and NS2B (1\u2013130)-NS3pro in the LMPC Fig 5A and 5B present the structure snapshots in the first MD simulations for the NS3pro alone and the NS2B-NS3pro complex. in this structure, the NS2B cofactor assumes an open conformation, thus has a minimal contact surface with the NS3pro domain. this would facilitate the identification of the most important residues of the NS2B in mediating the dynamics of the protease complex. the NS2B cofactor has much higher structural fluctuations than NS3pro. the bound NS2B cofactor is still capable to sample a large ensemble of conformations. Fig 6C presents the averaged RMSF of three independent MD simulations. the NS2B residues with RMSF > the average are over loop/turn residues and C-terminal residues. RMSF trajectories averaged over three independent MD simulations of the isolated NS3pro (a) and the NS2B-NS3pro complex (b) a mutation N214A on the extra domain is sufficient to decouple the correlated motions and consequently leads to the inactivation of the enzymatic catalysis. a global correlation network does exist in the NS2B-NS3pro complex. the majority of the significant correlated motions are established between the cofactor and NS3pro residues. mutual information matrixes of the NS2B-NS3pro complex (A) and isolated NS3pro (B) calculated from their MD simulation data by MutInf. yellow boxes are used for indicating the NS2B cofactor residues. pink boxes for the NS3pro residues having significant correlation motions. NS2B (48\u2013100;77\u201384)-NS3pro complex contains 19% helix. NS2B (48\u2013100;77\u201384)-NS3pro complex contains much lower strand (8%) but higher (36%) turn conformations than the isolated NS3pro and NS2B (48\u2013100)-NS3pro complex. NS2B (48\u2013100;77\u201384)-NS3pro complex has 37% unstructured conformation. HSQC peaks of the NS2B (48\u2013100;77\u201384)-NS3pro complex are superimposable to those of the NS2B (48\u2013100)-NS3pro complex. a large portion of detectable HSQC peaks are superimposable to those of the NS2B (48\u2013100)-NS3pro complex. the recombinant NS3pro protein was found to be completely insoluble and all in inclusion body as previously reported. as a result, the NS3pro proteins were first purified by Ni2+-affinity column in the presence of 8 M urea, followed by purification with reverse-phase (RP) HPLC. on the other hand, the GST-fused NS2B (48\u2013100) cofactor was found in supernatant and thereby purified under native condition isolated NS3pro consists of 53% random coil, 14% turn, 29% extended strand and 4% helix secondary structures. HSQC spectrum with very narrow spectral dispersions at both 1H (0.9 ppm) and 15N (19 ppm) dimensions. NS2B (48\u2013100) has a CD spectrum with the maximum negative signal at 206 nm and positive signal at 190 nm. NS2B contains 32% random coil, 24% turn, 7% extended strand and 37% helix secondary structures. NS2B has a short helix over residues Glu62-Gly69 while in the closed state (PDB ID: 3U1I), the NS2B only has -strands but no helical segment. HSQC peaks of the NS2B (48\u2013100) are much more broadened than those of NS3pro Fig 1C presents the obtained (C-C) chemical shifts. this is a sensitive indicator of the residual secondary structures in disordered proteins. the NS3pro domain in complex with NS2B has very large (C-C) deviations characteristic of a well-folded protein. isolated NS3pro has no stable secondary and tertiary structures in absence of the NS2B cofactor. dNN(i,i+1) and dN(i,i+1) manifest over the majority of the sequence. isolated NS3pro has no stable secondary and tertiary structures. residues over Ile65-Leu100 have relatively large hNOE. this region might have transit tertiary packing to a certain degree. residues over Ile65-Leu100 have relatively large hNOE. 0.85) are all located in the first -barrel of the chymotrypsin fold adopted by the NS3pro domain in the native NS2B-NS3pro complex. this suggests that these affected residues have long-range contacts with Cys27 with distances 25. the spin-label at the position 86 significantly affected the residues on both -barrels. the NS3pro alone showed no detectable catalytic activity even with a protease concentration up to 5 M in buffers at pH 7.5. however, the mixture has a CD spectrum for a protein with a substantial amount of secondary structures, which has a large positive signal at 190 nm and the maximum negative signal at 208 nm. HSQC spectrum of isolated NS3pro (blue) and NS2B-NS3pro mixture (red) in milli-Q water (pH 4.0) refolded NS2B-NS3pro complex in which only the NS3pro is 15N-labeled in buffer (pH 7.5) green ovals are used to indicate characteristic peaks. 3pro complex at pH 7.5 has a HSQC spectrum typical of a well-folded protein. it has very large spectral dispersions at both 1H (3.6 ppm) and 15N (28 ppm) dimensions. a large portion of the HSQC peaks of the present NS3pro domain are almost superimposable to those of the previous complex. the NS2B-NS3pro complex at pH 4.0 is enzymatically inactive. but once it is transferred into the buffer at pH 7.5, the tightly-packed structure will immediately form. the complex is expected to be anchored into the membranes by forming transmembrane helices at both N- and C-termini. spectrum of the full-length NS2B (1\u2013130) reconstituted in the LMPC micelle have the maximum negative signal at 209 nm and positive signal at 192 nm. the NS2B (1\u2013130) in the LMPC micelle contains 28% random coil, 23% turn, 17% extended strand and 32% helix secondary structures. a small set of broad peaks could be detected in its HSQC spectrum. NS2B (48\u2013100)-NS3pro complex reconstituted in the LMPC micelle. HSQC spectrum of the full-length NS2B (1\u2013130) reconstituted in the LMPC micelle in the buffer at pH 7.5 (red) green arrows are used to indicate the HSQC peaks of the refolded NS2B (1\u2013130)-NS3pro complex. HSQC spectrum of complex between NS2B (48\u2013100) and NS3pro in buffer. only a small set of HSQC resonance peaks could be observed. this is partly due to increased molecular weight of complex upon being anchored into LMPC micelle. the NS2B (1\u2013130)-NS3pro in the LMPC micelle is similar to the activity of the NS3pro in complex with the NS2B (48\u2013100) with transmembrane regions deleted. the NS2B cofactor assumes an open conformation, thus has a minimal contact surface with the NS3pro domain. the NS2B cofactor has large structural fluctuations, particularly over the residues Thr77-Met84 which are invisible in all previous crystal structures with an open conformation. the NS2B cofactor has large structural fluctuations, particularly over the residues Thr77-Met84 which are invisible in all previous crystal structures with an open conformation. RMSD trajectories averaged over three independent MD simulations of the isolated NS3pro (C), the NS3pro (D) and NS2B (cyan) in the context of the NS2B-NS3pro complex. only three regions of the isolated NS3pro have slightly higher fluctuations than the corresponding ones in the complex. RMSF trajectories averaged over three independent MD simulations of the isolated NS3pro (blue) and the NS2B-NS3pro complex (red) a mutation N214A on the extra domain is sufficient to decouple the correlated motions and consequently leads to the inactivation of the catalysis. cofactor residues asp20-Gln28, Gly39-Gly44, Met59-Glu66, Ly84-Val95, Pro106-Gln110, and Lys145-Gly148 are highly dynamic in the MD simulations. however, the global correlation network is eliminated as uncovered by the correlation analysis of the isolated NS3pro with the NS2B cofactor removed. NS3pro forms a complex with NS2B (48\u2013100;77\u201384) and the complex is soluble in buffer. NS2B (48\u2013100;77\u201384)-NS3pro complex contains 19% helix. NS2B (48\u2013100;77\u201384)-NS3pro complex contains much lower strand (8%) but higher (36%) turn conformations than the isolated NS3pro and NS2B (48\u2013100)-NS3pro complex NS2B (48\u2013100;77\u201384)-NS3pro complex has a very different structure from isolated NS3pro or NS2B (48\u2013100)-NS3pro complex. far-UV CD spectra of the isolated NS3pro (black), refolded NS2B (48\u2013100)-NS3pro complex at a molar ratio of 1:1 in the buffer at pH 7.5 (red) and NS2B (48\u2013100;77 some residues of the NS2B (48\u2013100;77\u201384)-NS3pro complex have conformations similar to those of the NS2B (48\u2013100)-NS3pro complex. however, HSQC peaks of the majority of residues were not detected, indicating that the NS2B (48\u2013100;77\u201384)-NS3pro complex undergoes conformational exchanges on s-ms, or/and dynamic oligomerization. this isolated NS3pro domain has been extensively characterized in solution by CD, NMR and PRE. despite owning a high-complexity sequence which is very different from classic IUPs, the NS3pro with the native sequence is intrinsically disordered without the NS2B cofactor. this indicates that the isolated NS3pro becomes completely insoluble in buffers by following the same mechanism as we previously established for other \u201ccompletely insoluble\u201d proteins [15\u201319] the dengue NS3pro complex only had weak binding to the FASN domain. the NS3pro itself may also play a role in triggering the early rearrangement of the ER before activating specific pathways. the NS3pro protein itself is also anchored into the ER membrane before NS3 forms the catalytically-active complex with NS2B. the NS3pro domains have different dynamics on the s-ms time scale. they are complexed with NS (48\u2013100) in buffer and with NS2B (1\u2013130) in the LMPC micelle. this complex may provide a platform for screening the inhibitors for the dengue protease. a similar scenario has been observed for the dengue NS2B-NS3pro complex. a global correlation network does exist in the NS2B-NS3pro complex. a slight perturbation of the NS2B-NS3pro interface may be sufficient. the dengue NS3pro protease may at least partly contribute to the current failure in developing effective inhibitors [7,45] alternative strategies are requested to target sites other than the active sites of the viral proteases, such as to inhibit the dimerization required for activity [46], or even to block the folding of the protease [54]. chymotrypsin-like fold requests the NS2B cofactor to coordinate the correct folding as well as correlated motions of the NS2B-NS3pro complex to achieve its catalytic function. results also suggest potential strategies to manipulate the NS2B-NS3pro interface for design of molecules in the future, which may effectively and specifically inhibit the protease activity."}
