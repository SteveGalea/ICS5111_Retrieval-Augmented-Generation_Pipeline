{"summary": "a strategy that seems to be common for all viruses involves the formation of specialized cellular microenvironments where cellular and viral macromolecules are recruited. viruses promote the progression of a productive replication cycle but also concomitantly coopt cellular factors and counteract a variety of antiviral responses. nuclear replication compartments are vital for virus replication. they contain DNA and RNA polymerases, transcriptional and posttranscriptional processing factors, and RNA export factors. RC assembled in the infected cell nucleus have not been isolated. adenoviral RC and nucleoli seem to have similar functional organization. morphological organization suggests a spatial separation of replication and transcription regions. adenoviral RC and nucleoli seem to have similar functional organization. the ultrastructural analysis of nucleoli has revealed three subcompartments that include the fibrillar centers (FC) surrounded by dense fibrillar components (DFC) the transcription of rRNA genes has been suggested to take place at the interface of FC and DFC, while ribosome assembly takes place in the granular component (48, 49) adenoviruses are ubiquitous infectious agents and one of the main models of tumor virology. but the molecular mechanisms by which adenoviral proteins reorganize and reprogram the infected cell nucleus are not completely understood. a detailed study of these viral structures should allow the elucidation of molecular mechanisms that govern the regulation of viral genome replication and expression but also cellular activities by viral infection. primary human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) were maintained in monolayer cultures in modified Eagle's medium. titers were determined as fluorescein-forming units (FFU) on HEK-293 cells. 107 cells were resuspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol [DTT], 20 g/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride [PMSF], 10 g/ml aprotinin, 10 g/ml pepstatin A, and 10 the supernatant contained cellular debris, and the pellet containing isolated nuclei was resuspended in S2 and stored at 20\u00b0C. the sonicated nuclei then were layered over an equal volume of solution 3 (S3) and centrifuged at 3,000 g at 4\u00b0C for 10 min. polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes were blocked for 2 h at room temperature with 3% nonfat milk. membranes were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with primary antibodies. bands were visualized on X-ray film (Kodak) superresolution imaging measurements were performed on an Olympus IX-81 inverted microscope configured for total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) excitation (cellTIRF Illuminator; Olympus Soft Imaging Solution GMBH) samples were continuously illuminated using excitation sources. all movies were recorded onto a 65- by 65-pixel region of an EMCCD camera at 100 nm per pixel. 300 images were acquired at 37 Hz with an exposure time of 23 ms at full laser power. each superresolution reconstruction was created at a pixel size of 10 nm. the DNA was precipitated with a 1/10 volume of 3 M sodium acetate and one volume of isopropanol overnight at 4\u00b0C. the pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 rpm at room temperature. RNA was purified from NUC, CYT, Nlo, RCf, and Npl from two independent experiments using TRIzol. primers for nucleolar DNA and RNA hybridized within the 18S rRNA sequence from nucleotide 1085 to 1224. primers used to detect spliced viral ML mRNA spanned the splice junction within the second and third exons of the TPL. 100 ng of RNA obtained from each subnuclear fraction from two independent experiments was reverse transcribed using Revert-Aid reverse transcriptase in a 20-l reaction volume. RT reactions were prepared to confirm the absence of DNA contamination. RC transcriptional activity was assayed in duplicate samples from two independent experiments. incubating RCf for 30 min at 37\u00b0C in a solution containing 200 mM ammonium sulfate, 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 5 mM MgCI2, 3 mM DTT, 50 M each deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) after this time, DNA was purified as described in the DNA pur the products were amplified for 25 cycles to avoid signal saturation. splicing activity associated with RCf was assayed in duplicate from two independent experiments. all primers were validated, proving to have an amplification efficiency close to 100%. the stepOne system was used for thermocycling; RT and NTC controls were prepared for each experiment. RNA extraction, cDNA library preparation, and sequencing were performed. primary human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) were maintained in monolayer cultures in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) fetal calf serum (Gibco-Invitrogen Corp.) for no more than 14 passages. titers were determined as fluorescein-forming units (FFU) on HEK-293 cells. a procedure designed to isolate nucleoli described previously (58) and recently adapted (59) all procedures were carried out on ice, except as indicated. ml aprotinin, 10 g/ml pepstatin A, and 10 g/ml leupeptin were layered over equal volume of solution 2 (S2) to isolate subnuclear fractions enriched with adenovirus RC (RCf), nuclei were sonicated with a Branson 1510 ultrasonic bath, until all nuclei were lysed as observed by phase-contrast microscopy. gels were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. membranes were blocked for 2 h at room temperature with 3% nonfat milk. membranes were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with primary antibodies. X-81 inverted microscope with a 100/1.49-numerical-aperture oil-immersion objective lens with an extra 1.6 intermediate magnification lens and an electron-multiplying charge-coupled-device camera. cells were mounted on coverslips and treated as described above. RC and nucleolar fractions were spotted onto silane (Sigma)-coated slides. all movies were recorded onto a 65- by 65-pixel region of an EMCCD camera at 100 nm per pixel. subdiffraction images were derived from the Bayesian analysis of the stochastic blinking and bleaching (termed 3B analysis) of Alexa Fluor dyes (61). each superresolution reconstruction, 300 images were acquired at 37 Hz with an exposure time of 23 ms at full laser power. proteinase K inactivation was performed for 10 min at 95\u00b0C. the reactions were centrifuged for 2 min at 14,000 rpm at room temperature. the DNA was precipitated with a 1/10 volume of 3 M sodium acetate and one volume of isopropanol overnight at 4\u00b0C. primers used to detect spliced viral ML mRNA spanned the splice junction between exons 4 and 5 in the actin mRNA, from nucleotide 875 to 1013. primers for nucleolar DNA and RNA hybridized within the 18S rRNA sequence from nucleotide 1085 to 1224. nucleolar DNA and RNA (18S) Fw, CGATGCCGACCGGCGATG; Rv, CTCCTGGTGGTGCCCTTC; nonnucleolar DNA (U1) Fw, ACCTGGCAGGAGATACCAT; Rv, GCAGTCGAGTTTCCCACATTTGG; spliced viral mRNA (actin mRNA) Fw, CGCCTCCGAACGGTACTCCGCC; Rv, CG RCf-associated DNA polymerase activity was assayed in duplicate samples from two independent experiments. DNA was purified as described in the DNA purification section. after this time, DNA was purified as described in the DNA purification section. RNA synthesis was determined by RT-PCR using viral primers within the TPL sequence and cellular primers for actin mRNA and 18S rRNA. the products were amplified for 25 cycles to avoid signal saturation. RNA synthesis was determined by RT-PCR using viral primers within the TPL sequence. the primers used allowed the amplification of ML and L5 pre-mRNA and spliced species. snRNA was used as an endogenous control. the primers were validated, proving to have an amplification efficiency close to 100%. reads were aligned using Bowtie2 aligner (68) to exon-exon junctions. adenoviral replication cycle comprises a complex interplay between viral and cellular factors that regulate and establish optimal conditions for viral genome replication. the accumulation of newly replicated viral DNA molecules promotes late gene expression and consequently viral progeny production. fractionation protocol was developed to isolate adenovirus RC (Fig. 1A) (53) was used to determine the localization of DBP and nucleolin within isolated RC particles by TIRF microscopy and the Bayesian analysis of blinking and bleaching (3B analysis) this approach allowed, for the first time, a nanoscale analysis of isolated RC particles that can help us study their organization at a resolution of approximately 50 nm. TIRF images and 3B reconstructions of Ad-infected HFF, fixed 24 (D) or 36 (E) hpi and immunolabeled for DBP (green) and nucleolin (red) the TIRF images represent averages from 300 micrographs. the TIRF image represents the average from 300 micrographs. in contrast to conventional IF microscopy, each of the larger structures was overlaid with numerous small DBP foci, especially by the later time point analyzed (36 hpi) the distribution of DBP or nucleolin in these particles was the same as that observed in RC within Ad-infected cells. RCf isolated at 36 hpi formed clusters (Fig. 1E, o to q), displaying a similar morphology to that observed for RC within Ad-infected cells. adenoviral pV protein induced the relocalization of nucleolin to the cytoplasm. nucleolin is known to be phosphorylated and to possess autocatalytic activity, resulting in cleavage fragments with apparent molecular masses of about 100, 70, 60, and 50 kDa (72) such fragments closely match the bands observed in RCf fractions from Ad-infected cells. these results confirm that nucleolin was relocalized to RC. RCf are sites of viral DNA synthesis and late gene expression. RCf could be expected to contain other viral and cellular components that participate in these molecular processes, such as the viral E2B DNA polymerase (Ad pol), the cellular RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II) and spliceosome components. both nucleolar DNA (ribosomal DNA) and nonnucleolar DNA (U1 gene) were measured in these experiments when no amplification from these cellular DNA was observed. this results clearly indicate that RCf contain active Ad pol that can direct de novo synthesis of viral DNA. rRNA synthesis was dependent on the presence of NTP and inhibited to input levels by ActD treatment. same analysis was made to evaluate cellular mRNA synthesis when no in vitro transcription was observed. RNA was isolated, and de novo-synthesized pre-mRNA was amplified by RT-PCR. rRNA synthesis showed an almost 3-fold increase at 36 hpi compared to the level for MK. RCf have both RNA pol I- and pol II-associated activity. splicing factors and snRNP are localized adjacent to DBP foci. RCf from Ad-infected cells showed a progressive increase at the different times postinfection in the levels of spliced actin mRNA species. it is possible that IG coisolate with RC, which may account for the de novo processing of cellular species of pre-mRNA in RCf. adenovirus late gene expression program requires the initiation of viral DNA synthesis for the activation of the major late (MLP) and L4 (L4P) promoters. the complexity of the viral late gene expression program is compounded with posttranscriptional processing of all mRNA species produced by the L1 to L5 viral late mRNA families. RNA was isolated from RCf and Npl at 24 and 36 hpi as before. primers designed to amplify sequences from the ML TPL and L5 spliced or unspliced mRNA were employed as described in Materials and Methods. a similar increase in ML or L5 pre-mRNA was observed from 24 to 36 hpi. cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were harvested at 24 or 36 hpi. total RNA was isolated from each fraction and analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. no amplification of pre-mRNA was detected in cytoplasmic fractions. ratio of processed to nonprocessed mRNA increased to a greater extent than that for ML mRNA in RCf. decrease in quantity of spliced L5 mRNA in the nucleus and its simultaneous accumulation in the cytoplasm at the same time point. mRNA splicing and export to the cytoplasm are more efficient than those of the rest of the ML transcripts. splice sites for the Ad genome have been reported for serotype 2 (85) but the annotation was not complete for serotype 5. in this viral genome a region in the E3 transcription unit that includes the 5\u2032 splice site of the z leader has been deleted, while x and y leaders remain intact. a greater quantity of spliced than unspliced mRNA was found for both ML and L5 at 36 hpi. the number of reads aligned for ML mRNA species was greater than those for L5 mRNA. the biological significance of i leader exon inclusion or exclusion has not been elucidated, but it has been shown to depend on the viral E4Orf3 and E4Orf6 proteins. quantitative analysis of the differential biogenesis of individual viral late mRNA species at different times of viral replication should be performed. results from quantitative RT-PCR assays and RNA-Seq indicate for the first time that alternative splicing of L5 mRNA is associated with RC. mRNA are spliced and accumulate in the cytoplasm more efficiently than the rest of the ML mRNA at late times postinfection. adenovirus RC has been isolated from the nucleus on the basis of features such as size, molecular mass, and density. a fractionation protocol was recently developed to isolate adenovirus RC. it was used to determine the localization of DBP and nucleolin within isolated RC particles. micrographs of RCf and nucleolar fractions were taken with a 63 objective (scale bar, 2 m) micrographs of RCf and nucleolar fractions were taken with a 63 objective (scale bar, 2 m), and insets show a 5 zoom of RC or nucleoli of the expected size. nucleolin was detected as a faint, diffuse signal that was mostly nuclear, with some cytoplasmic staining near the periphery of the nucleus. the weak signal was overlaid with a small number of higher-intensity large inclusion-like structures that were devoid of DBP. however, each of the larger structures was overlaid with numerous small DBP foci. a to c and h to j showed that nucleolin was associated with these structures. essentially no colocalization with DBP was observed at 24 hpi. colocalization of DBP and nucleolin was observed at the periphery. nucleolin was redistributed from the nucleolus to all subcellular fractions. the protein levels were approximately 5-fold higher in the nucleolar fraction (Nlo) than in the nucleoplasmic (Npl) and total nuclear fractions (NL) Western blot (WB) of nucleolin and DBP in subnuclear fractions. nucleolar (Nlo), replication compartment (RCf), nucleoplasm (Npl) and cytoplasmic (CYT) fractions, as well as total cell lysates (TL) and total nuclear lysates (NL) were obtained from mock-infected or Ad-infected HFF at 36 hpi. viral DNA synthesis in RCf was evaluated in fractions obtained at 16 hpi. the RCf were incubated in a reaction mixture in the presence of ATP and dNTP. DNA then was extracted and purified, and viral DNA was amplified by PCR. DNA was isolated, and de novo synthesized DNA was amplified by RT-PCR. RNA was isolated, and de novo-synthesized pre-mRNA was amplified by RT-PCR. rRNA synthesis was observed both in mock-infected (MK) and Ad-infected cells. rRNA synthesis showed an almost 3-fold increase at 36 hpi compared to the level for MK. viral late mRNA splicing was evaluated in the subnuclear fractions. the RCf were incubated in a reaction mixture in the presence of ATP and creatine phosphate. RNA then was extracted and purified, and spliced viral mRNA was analyzed. RNA was isolated, and spliced mRNA was amplified by RT-PCR. spliced viral late mRNA (A) and cellular mRNA (C) correspond to nucleoli. it is not yet clear at which stage of posttranscriptional processing these transcripts may dissociate from RC to be transported to IG and later exported to the cytoplasm. it is not known whether each viral late mRNA species can be processed in the same compartments or with similar kinetics. this studies all have relied on immunofluorescence or electron microscopy. the increase in spliced mRNA from 24 to 36 hpi was higher for L5 than for ML, for which a 6-fold increase was observed. cytoplasmic accumulation of L5 mRNA was more efficient than that of ML, since at 36 hpi a greater number of spliced L5 transcripts was quantified in the cytoplasm than in the nucleus. mRNA splicing activity was detected in RCf at 36 hpi. the decrease in the quantity of spliced L5 mRNA in the nucleus. mRNA splicing and export to the cytoplasm are more efficient than those of the rest of the ML transcripts. RCf and Npl fractions were obtained from Ad WT-infected HFF. total RNA was isolated from each fraction and quantified by real-time RT-PCR as described in Materials and Methods. splice sites for the Ad genome have been reported for serotype 2 (85) but the annotation was not complete for serotype 5. in this viral genome a region in the E3 transcription unit that includes the 5\u2032 splice site of the z leader has been deleted. in this viral genome a region in the E3 transcription unit that includes the 5\u2032 splice site of the z leader has been deleted. reads aligned to the splice junction between leaders x and y could correspond to either of these two viral mRNA species. the overall coverage pattern for reads aligned to splice junctions in RCf closely matched those from total cell lysates recently reported for Ad2 (85) d to the leader 2-3 junction (ML P, black bars), leader 3-fiber junction (L5 P, gray bars), and intron region immediately upstream of fiber (L5 NP, gray bars) the number of sequence reads covering these splice sites as well as the nucleotides covering the splice junctions shown in the graph are listed in the table. Isolated adenoviral RC are morphologically similar and recapitulate activities associated with RC in the infected cell. the distribution of DBP associated with RC within the infected cell nucleus by conventional or confocal microscopy has shown that the protein forms closed circular structures that seem to coalesce. studies are under way to determine the localization of viral and cellular proteins associated with RC. the presence of bona fide RC markers in RCf (53) suggested these subnuclear fractions should contain the enzymatic activities associated with these viral sites in the infected cell. gene replication, transcription, RNA processing, and transport are nuclear activities that, although transient, can be associated with the nuclear matrix (reviewed in references 90 and 92). the RC subnuclear fraction contains associated nuclear matrix molecules, explaining the presence of cellular mRNA in the RCf. nucleolin is relocalized to RC in adenovirus-infected cells. phosphoproteins B23.1 and B23.2 interact with viral E2 proteins. accumulation of rRNA in the cytoplasm is impaired during adenovirus infection. nucleolin localized to specific compartments of adenoviral RC. nucleolin interacts with viral DNA replication factors UL44 and UL84 at the periphery of viral replication compartments. other proteins from RNA or DNA viruses target nucleolar proteins to subserve viral transcription, translation, and regulation of the cell cycle to promote viral replication. nucleolin is a phosphoprotein with self-cleavage properties. slower-migrating bands detected with anti-nucleolin antibody were more abundant in RCf than Npl or other subcellular fractions. nucleolin also was detected in its intact form, suggesting that the various forms of nucleolin become associated with RCf during infection. it is unlikely that the fractionation procedure accounts for the generation of the proteolytic (or posttranslationally modified) products. adenoviral replication cycle involves a gene expression program with multiple levels of regulation, from sequential regulation of transcription to the selective export and translation of viral late mRNA. such increases depend on the accumulation of replicated viral genomes and the presence of a number of cellular and viral proteins. the spliced versus unspliced L5 mRNA was different from that for ML. the pattern of accumulation of the spliced versus unspliced L5 mRNA was different from that for ML. this suggests that each viral late mRNA family is subject to different regulatory events during their biogenesis associated with RC. adenoviral RC are morphologically similar and recapitulate activities associated with RC in the infected cell. the distribution of DBP associated with RC within the infected cell nucleus by conventional or confocal microscopy has shown that the protein forms closed circular structures that seem to coalesce. this complex assembly of RC is stable enough to be isolated. studies are under way to determine the localization of viral and cellular proteins that are known to be associated with RC. the presence of bona fide RC markers in RCf (53) suggested these subnuclear fractions also should contain the enzymatic activities associated with these viral sites in the infected cell. the nuclear matrix is commonly defined as the subnuclear fraction that results from sequential salt extractions using increasing concentrations of detergent and nuclease treatment (90, 91) DNA replication, transcription, RNA processing, and transport are nuclear activities that, although transient, can be associated with the nuclear matrix (reviewed in references 90 and 92) nucleolin is relocalized to RC in adenovirus-infected cells. phosphoproteins B23.1 and B23.2 interact with viral E2 proteins and basic core proteins pV and pVII, promoting efficient DNA replication. nucleolin localized to specific compartments of adenoviral RC. the localization of nucleolin at the periphery of RC particles suggests this nucleolar protein could participate in adenoviral genome replication or expression. in cytomegalovirus-infected cells, nucleolin interacts with viral DNA replication factors UL44 and UL84 at the periphery of viral replication compartments. anti-nucleolin antibody was more abundant in RCf than Npl or other subcellular fractions. nucleolin also was detected in its intact form, as the expected 102-kDa band was more abundant than the modified products. this suggests that Ad infection mimics the conditions in the cell that induce modification and processing of nucleolin. the complex adenoviral replication cycle involves a gene expression program with multiple levels of regulation, from sequential regulation of transcription to the selective export and translation of viral late mRNA. such increases depend on the accumulation of replicated viral genomes and the presence of a number of cellular and viral proteins. all nuclear pre-mRNA increased as the late phase of infection progressed. the efficiency of the cytoplasmic accumulation of the L5 mRNA was significantly higher than that of the rest of all ML mRNA combined. the pattern of accumulation of the spliced versus unspliced L5 mRNA was different from that for ML. exons from the MLTU are present in PRZ and in IG, suggesting that splicing occurs in both compartments. but the data presented here suggest either that IG are coisolated in the RCf or that all IG components required for complete splicing of viral late mRNA are coopted to adenovirus RC. quantitative analyses of the proteomic composition and further transcriptomic analyses of RCf are under way."}
