{"summary": "if the hospital does not have isolation rooms, it is possible that patients with respiratory problems will be assigned to normal beds in the ED. airborne pathogens are particles that are 5 m or smaller (aerosol) as they travel in the air, their dispersion to nearby areas is possible. isolation rooms for patients with airborne pathogens require a minimum ventilation rate of 6\u201312 ACH [5,6]. second, the location of diffusers was changed around the beds in the ED. an alternative was designed by considering the general design of inlets and outlets for negative pressure chambers. airborne pathogens are particles that are 5 m or smaller (aerosol) as they travel in the air, their dispersion to nearby areas is possible, depending on the indoor air conditions. partitions are used in target ED in hospitals as a means to control the dispersion of airborne pathogens. a partition was installed between the ED beds, and the degree of change observed in the pathogen dispersion patterns was analyzed. this approach is thought to be an alternative that can prevent the dispersion of airborne pathogens to adjacent beds. the conventional fabric partition or curtains between beds easily pass the airborne pathogens smaller than 5 m. conditions concerning the surrounding areas, which cannot be specified, were excluded and the subject space was independently modeled in the analysis. the subjects of the analysis were the airflow and ventilation conditions of the bed area in the ED. the ventilation condition without airborne pathogen control was set at 3 ACH. this is the minimum value in the range of 6 ACH\u201312 ACH. this is the required ventilation rate inside negative pressure units. base model 2,405,265 Type 1 2,691,618 The numbers of inlets and outlets were slightly different in the base model and the Type 1 model. this was because the diffusers were placed in the spaces between the beds so that the ventilation would not occur directly in the face of the patient. Figure 4 shows the data measuring points for the analysis of pathogen concentration. the points were set at a height of 1.0 m, in consideration of the location of the respiratory system of a patient lying in a bed. the meshing conditions of the base models are provided in Table 2. ventilation rate was 3 ACH, per regulation, with no partitions between the beds. inlets were around the periphery of the ED (Region A) and the outlets were in the central area (Region B) the quanta generation rate of influenza was set to 515 particles/h [17,18] in south Korea, only one patient companion can stay in the ED and take care of the patient near their bedside. star-CCM+ is a CFD simulation tool to fluid dynamics, particle/gas flow and heat transfer in a controlled volume. the subjects of the study were the airflow and ventilation conditions of the bed area in the ED, and variation in the pathogen dispersion trend with the installation of partitions. pathogen control was set at 6 ACH. this is the minimum value in the range of 6 ACH\u201312 ACH. this is the required ventilation rate inside negative pressure units. base model 2,405,265 Type 1 2,691,618 The numbers of inlets and outlets were slightly different in the base model and the Type 1 model. the inlet condition for the Star-CCM+ simulation model was set to the velocity inlet, and the outlet condition was set as a split ratio outlet. the detailed thermal conditions of the simulation models are shown in Table 1. the meshing conditions of the base and Type 1 models are provided in Table 2. the black boxes above the beds are inlets and outlets of the ventilator. the bulge of the bed is 2.0 m 0.9 m 0.5 m. the inlets were around the periphery of the ED (Region A), and the outlets were in the central area (Region B) the inlet was located near the side of the patient\u2019s respiratory system. the conditions of Case 2 were the same as in Case 1 and 2, respectively. the duration of a patient\u2019s stay in the emergency room depends on the patient\u2019s condition, but in the worst case, a patient may stay for two or three days. in the worst case, a patient may stay for two or three days. in the condition without partitions, there was minimal effect on the average concentration at the periphery. however, the change of outlet location (from Region B to Region A) reduced the dispersion of the pathogen to the adjacent beds. Figure 8 shows the analysis results for Cases 1 and 2 in plan and sectional views. the pathogen concentration at the hallway side was slightly higher in case 1 than in case 2. Changing the Diffuser Locations and Increasing the Ventilation Rate Cases 3 and 4 are the same as Cases 1 and 2 respectively, except for the ventilation rate. the ventilation rates for Cases 3 and 4 are the same as Cases 1 and 2, respectively, except for the ventilation rate. ventilation system inlets were installed over the patients\u2019 respiratory systems. the airflow into the inlet acted like an air-curtain and prevented the airborne pathogen dispersion to other places. in case 6, with a 3 ACH ventilation rate, the airborne pathogens were not sufficiently exhausted at the outlet above the patients\u2019 respiratory organs. the simulated results of Cases 7 and 8 demonstrate that the increase in airborne pathogen concentration occurred mainly at X3. the increased ventilation ensures a solution for airborne infection prevention. the pathogen concentration at the pathogen source bed was slightly reduced. the pathogen concentration at X2-Y5 and X3-Y5 in case 6 exceeded the corresponding values in Case 1 and 2. a higher pathogen concentration means a higher infection risk. Changing the Diffuser Locations Case 1 and 2 had the same ventilation rate of 3 ACH. but the ventilation system inlet and outlet locations were switched to compare the consequent pathogen dispersion patterns. Figure 8a,b show the results of a central air supply and peripheral exhaust over the respiratory systems of patients. the ventilation rates for Cases 3 and 4 were increased to 6 ACH. pathogen control by increasing the ventilation rate would have a greater effect on the pathogen concentration than changing ventilation inlet and outlet locations would. the pathogen concentration at the hallway side was higher in both cases 1 and 2. the pathogen dispersed towards the adjacent beds on the opposite sides. the pathogen concentration at the hallway side was higher in both cases 1 and 2. in plan view, the pathogen dispersion for the conditions of changing the inlet locations at the ventilation rate of 3 ACH. in case 5, the air was supplied over the patient\u2019s respiratory system (Region A), and the air supply pattern in sectional view was as shown in Figure 10b. installing partitions caused airborne pathogen concentration to increase at X2 and X4. however, installing partitions contributed to a decrease in the airborne pathogen concentrations at X1 and X5. this could increase the infection risk for medical staff working in the source bed area. in plan view, the pathogen dispersion for the conditions of changing the inlet locations at the ventilation rate of 3 ACH. in case 5, the air was supplied over the patient\u2019s respiratory system (Region A), and the air supply pattern in sectional view was as shown in Figure 10b. installing partitions contributed to a decrease in the airborne pathogen concentrations at X1 and X4. the pathogen concentration in the pathogen source bed greatly increased compared to the other cases. the study focused on the effects of some potential solutions for preventing the spread of airborne pathogens in EDs. adjusting ventilation inlet and outlet locations could cause dispersion of the airborne pathogen (Case 6) setting the parallel bed layout and exhaust port near the patient\u2019s head will lower the probability of air infection in the isolating room. natural ventilation has limitation or disadvantage regarding airflow control, heat recovery, outdoor contaminants incoming [28,30]. partial fan assisted natural ventilation with appropriate filtering system, dedicated outdoor air system (intermediate season) and heat recovery system (heating season) in HVAC system can be good solutions. the most effective method for pathogen control was to use all the methods studied: Increasing the ventilation rate, installing partitions, and positioning the ventilation system outlets over the patients\u2019 respiratory organs. further research will be conducted to improve architectural techniques for preventing the dispersion of airborne pathogens."}
