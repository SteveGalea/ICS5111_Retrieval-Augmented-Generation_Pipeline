{"summary": "influenza A viruses are divided into three types: A, B and C. influenza A viruses are responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality during seasonal epidemics. a zoonotic spillover event of influenza A could potentially be the cause of a novel pandemic. zoonotic transmission of avian influenza A viruses from birds to humans of subtypes H5N1 [7,8] H7N9 [9], H9N2 [10], H6N1 [11], H7N3 [12,13] and H10N8 [14] has occurred, sometimes leading to fatal disease. infections with H5N1 and H7N9 viruses in particular constitute a pandemic threat [15] vaccines that induce HA globular head-specific antibodies will become less effective when mutations in HA accumulate to such an extent that vaccine-induced HA-specific antibodies can no longer recognize their target. currently used vaccines are generally trivalent; they contain components of two influenza A strains (H1N1 and H3N2) and one influenza B strain. inactivated vaccines can induce mucosal immunity, in addition to systemic antibody and T cell responses, more closely mimicking the immune response induced after natural influenza virus infection. despite low immunogenicity of inactivated vaccines in children, LAIV may be better suited to protect this age group. novel approaches to vaccination against influenza can be improved in two important ways. such vaccines should induce antibodies against more conserved proteins or regions thereof. such vaccines should hit the nail (but not just on the head) influenza genome encodes 11 proteins on eight segments of RNA: HA, NA, NP, M1, M2, NS1, NS2, PA, PB1, PB1-F2 and PB2. these proteins are variably conserved among avian and human virus isolates. PB1-F2, NA, M2, NS1 and NS2 proteins were found to contain no sequences completely conserved in at least 80% of the viruses. antibodies do not cross-protect against different HA subtypes or distantly related strains of the same subtype. they can also mediate a number of non-neutralizing immunologic functions. this includes blocking of fusion between the viral and endosomal membrane, innate immune system activation, complement-mediated lysis and phagocytosis. a conjugate peptide vaccine targeting the HA cleavage site induced an antibody response that was able to protect mice from challenge with both influenza B lineages. a similar strategy was attempted for influenza A and achieved a decrease in mortality and morbidity but did not fully protect vaccinated mice. inducing antibodies against the HA cleavage site or globular head may be of interest for universal vaccine development. but by far most attention has focused on inducing antibodies against the stem region. infection of humans with pandemic H1N1 led to induction of broadly neutralizing antibody responses against epitopes. conserved HA epitopes are essentially an HA molecule that lacks the globular head domain while maintaining the structural integrity of the stem. mice challenged with homologous virus showed no mortality and were partially protected against weight loss. the induction of NA-specific antibodies alone is considered an undesirable strategy for universal vaccine production as it would result in an infection-permissive vaccine. however, they remain of considerable interest as vaccine candidates in combination with other antigens. the original Hepatitis B core protein-linked M2e vaccine candidate [78] was improved upon by expressing multiple M2e sequences in tandem. the combination of a production system that circumvents egg-based methods, the possibility of intranasal vaccination and the high immunogenicity has spurred phase 1 clinical trials with this vaccine (ACAM-FLU-A, Sanofi Pasteur) several other production systems have been tested for M2e, some of which will be discussed further under the novel antigen delivery heading. protective role of pre-existing virus specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells has also been demonstrated against experimental infections [96,97] and natural infection with the pandemic virus of 2009 [98] studies employ adoptive transfer of T cells from primed donor to naive recipient mice have contributed to our understanding of the function of CD8+ cells in viral clearance. nucleoprotein (NP) is a structural protein that encapsidates the influenza virus RNA genome. it has key functions in RNA transcription, replication and packaging. it is highly conserved among different influenza A subtypes. viral vectors are recombinant, non-influenza viruses engineered to express influenza viral proteins. cellular immune responses appear to play a pivotal role in protection from influenza infection. the advantage of using viral vectors is that they drive de novo synthesis of proteins in infected cells and facilitate endogenous antigen processing and presentation. price et al have shown that immunization with a mixture of adenoviruses expressing NP and M2 confers heterosubtypic immunity [112], and can even reduce transmission in a mouse model [113]. the simultaneous expression of surface and internal proteins has the potential to induce both humoral and cell mediated immunity. RNA viral vectors have also been considered for expression of influenza virus proteins. RNA virus vectors have received less attention than DNA vectors as novel antigen delivery systems for universal influenza vaccines. some of the practical advantages include rapid production and flexible antigen exchange. the lack of replication in the recipient has consequences for the type and the magnitude of immune response induced. the advantages are mostly practical, as it is an efficient, easy to produce, safe platform that potentially allows for rapid production of vaccines in pandemic situations. alum has had only limited effects on improving immunogenicity of influenza virus vaccines. oil-in-water combinations such as MF59 and ASO3 have been shown to be much more effective and are now licensed and used in seasonal and (pre)pandemic vaccine preparations. PB1-F2, NA, M2, NS1 and NS2 proteins were found to contain no sequences that were completely conserved in at least 80% of the viruses. however, comparison of the sequences of PB2, PB1, PA, NP, and PB2 proteins showed that 55 sequences of 9\u201358 amino acids were completely conserved in at least 80%, or even as much as 95% to 100%, of the avian and human virus isolates. ADCC occurs when effector cells recognize the Fc portion of IgG bound to viral antigens presented on cell surfaces. the interaction of CD16 on NK cells with the Fc portion of IgG activates pathways that result in DNA damage and apoptosis. the viral antigens considered to induce a humoral immune response, either neutralizing or non-neutralizing, are discussed below. a similar strategy was attempted for influenza A and achieved a decrease in mortality and morbidity but did not fully protect vaccinated mice. decreased mortality and induction of heterosubtypic immunity could also be demonstrated in mice immunized with a H3N2 fusion peptide. group 2 HA stem-specific antibodies have less frequently been reported in humans. 4% of vaccinated individuals were able to cross-neutralize H7N9 viruses. alternative stem-specific antibodies that broadly neutralize group 1 influenza A viruses have been identified in humans. vaccine strategy resulted in production of immune sera with broader reactivity than when full-length HA was used. mice challenged with homologous virus showed no mortality and were partially protected against weight loss. alternative strategy to induce stem-specific antibodies involves repeated vaccination with chimeric HA molecules that contain the same stem region. matrix 2 protein is a relatively conserved transmembrane ion channel important for uncoating of the virus particle. the extracellular domain of this protein (M2e) consists of only 23 amino acids. the proposed immunological mechanism that mediates the protection is ADCC, but also a role for alveolar macrophages. internal proteins Non-neutralizing antibodies mounted against highly conserved internal proteins may contribute to clearing influenza virus-infected cells. NP may be transiently expressed on the cellular surface [83], thus offering a target for antibody binding and possible subsequent neutralization or ADCC. studies employing adoptive transfer of T cells from primed donor to naive recipient mice have contributed to our understanding of the function of both CD4+ and CD8+ cells in protection. CD4+ cells are thought to be of importance predominantly for the generation and maintenance of memory cells and for antibody production. a number of novel vaccine platforms have been developed that allow for this. matrix 1 protein is an influenza protein that plays important structural and functional roles in the viral life cycle. it forms a layer between the viral envelope and the ribonucleoproteins (RNPs, the combination of genomic RNA, viral polymerase and NP proteins) functionally it drives viral budding and helps to control intracellular trafficking. the viral antigens considered to induce a humoral immune response, either neutralizing or non-neutralizing, are discussed below. a conjugate peptide vaccine targeting the HA cleavage site induced an antibody response that was able to protect mice from challenge with both influenza A and B lines. conserved epitopes on the globular head, instead of the stem, can be advantageous because they are readily accessible to antibodies. a human monoclonal antibody, designated CH65, was found to neutralize 30 out of 36 H1N1 strains tested, but no heterosubtypic immunity was demonstrated. group 2 HA stem-specific antibodies have less frequently been reported in humans. 4% of human monoclonal antibodies from vaccinated individuals were able to cross-neutralize group 2 viruses. alternative stem-specific antibodies that broadly neutralize group 1 influenza A viruses have been identified in humans. alternative strategy to induce stem-specific antibodies involves repeated vaccination with chimeric HA molecules that contain the same stem region but that differ in their globular head domains. chimeric HA molecules that contain the same stem region are boosted with each vaccination while the response to the globular head is a primary response. these approaches show considerable promise as universal vaccine candidates. matrix 2 protein is a relatively conserved transmembrane ion channel important for uncoating of the virus particle. the extracellular domain of this protein (M2e) consists of only 23 amino acids and appears to be an attractive target due to its surface localization. the proposed immunological mechanism that mediates the protection is ADCC, but also a role for alveolar macrophages. the exact mechanism through which this clearance is mediated remains largely unclear. non-neutralizing antibodies to conserved proteins alone may not be sufficient for broad immunity. however, evidence is mounting that they are of importance in conjunction with, for example, cell mediated immunity. a conjugate peptide vaccine targeting the HA cleavage site induced an antibody response that was able to protect mice from challenge with both influenza B lines. a similar strategy was attempted for influenza A and achieved a decrease in mortality and morbidity but did not fully protect vaccinated mice. targeting epitopes on the globular head, instead of the stem, can be advantageous since they are readily accessible to antibodies. antibodies to group 1 influenza HAs can typically be induced by infection or vaccination. but remain subdominant to the head-specific antibodies due to limited access of the stem. infection of humans with pandemic H1N1 led to the induction of broadly neutralizing antibody responses against epitopes in the HA head and stem region. encoding headless HA resulted in production of immune sera with broader reactivity than when full-length HA was used. mice challenged with homologous virus showed no mortality and were partially protected against weight loss. matrix 2 protein is a relatively conserved transmembrane ion channel important for uncoating of the virus particle. the extracellular domain of this protein (M2e) consists of only 23 amino acids and appears to be an attractive target due to its surface localization. the proposed immunological mechanism that mediates the protection is ADCC, but also a role for alveolar macrophages. clinical trials with this vaccine (ACAM-FLU-A, Sanofi Pasteur) have shown both good safety and high levels of seroconversion. many other production systems have been tested for M2e, some of which will be discussed further under the novel antigen delivery heading. a wealth of evidence exists for the importance of CD8+ cells in viral clearance. CD4+ cells are thought to be of importance predominantly for the generation and maintenance of memory cells and for antibody production. a number of novel vaccine platforms have been developed that allow for this. matrix 1 (M1) protein is an influenza protein that plays important structural and functional roles in the viral life cycle. it forms a layer between the viral envelope and the ribonucleoproteins (RNPs, the combination of genomic RNA, viral polymerase and NP proteins) functionally, it drives viral budding and helps to control intracellular trafficking. highly conserved epitopes and consensus sequences have been employed in various vaccine platforms. the immunodominant HLA-A*0201 restricted M158-66 epitope [104] is under functional constraints. mutations were not tolerated without loss of viral fitness. vaccines may be used as bivalent vaccines, inducing immunity against the vector itself or its origin and the transgenic influenza virus protein(s) other concerns include the possibility of recombination and reversion to virulence in chickens. potentially pre-existing immunity to the MVA vector induced after vaccinia virus vaccination against small pox before 1975 does not interfere with immunogenicity. many different influenza virus proteins have been expressed in MVA vectors. priming with an adenoviral vector with NP and M1 followed by an MVA-NP-M1 boost, provided better heterologous protection than using either recombinant vector alone [124] DNA Vaccines Vaccination with DNA plasmids encoding influenza viral antigens has been investigated as a potential universal influenza virus vaccination strategy. some of the practical advantages include rapid production, flexible antigen exchange and safety for use with highly pathogenic viruses. concerns have been raised about integration of constructs into the vaccine recipient's genome. virosomes are essentially influenza virus envelopes that lack the genetic material of the original virus. they consist of a phospholipid bilayer with incorporated surface glycoproteins (HA and NA) this vaccine platform is shown to be safe, potentially more effective than existing vaccines at inducing protective antibody titers. oil-in-water adjuvants raise the quantity of cross-reactive antibodies. the use of specific adjuvants may help to improve these cell-mediated immune responses. some saponin based adjuvants can translocate antigen across the membrane of antigen presenting cells. vaccines could be used as bivalent vaccines, inducing immunity against the vector itself or its origin and the transgenic influenza virus protein(s) other concerns include the possibility of recombination and reversion to virulence in chickens. immunity to the MVA vector induced after vaccinia virus vaccination against small pox before 1975 does not interfere with immunogenicity. many different influenza virus proteins have been expressed in MVA vectors. priming with an adenoviral vector with NP and M1 followed by an MVA-NP-M1 boost provided better heterologous protection than using either recombinant vector alone. clinical trials have so far been only moderately successful [135,136,137] since plasmid DNA was poorly immunogenic in humans. new techniques, such as self-amplifying mRNA-based vaccines, also appear to show promise in pre-clinical studies. phospholipid bilayer with incorporated surface glycoproteins (HA and NA) is safe, potentially more effective than existing vaccines at inducing protective antibody titers. it has been postulated that they may achieve these cellular responses through HA-mediated virosome entry into cells, mimicking infection, and delivery of antigen into the cytoplasm. conventional inactivated influenza vaccines induce virus specific CD8+ T cells responses inefficiently. the use of specific adjuvants may help to improve these cell-mediated immune responses. some saponin based adjuvants, like ISCOMS, can translocate antigen across the membrane of antigen presenting cells and thus promote the endogenous route of antigen processing and presentation. platforms such as MVA show much promise for decreasing response time in an outbreak situation. but as for a universal influenza vaccine, we haven't quite nailed it yet."}
