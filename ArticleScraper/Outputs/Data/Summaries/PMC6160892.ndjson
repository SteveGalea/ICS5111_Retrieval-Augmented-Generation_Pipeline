{"summary": "IBV local isolates GX-YL5, GX-GL11079 and GX-NN09032 belonging to serotype 1, 2 and 5, were isolated from Guangxi, China. the birds were reared in separate isolators following animal welfare guidelines and under strict biosecurity measures. experimental design Seven-day-old SPF birds were randomly divided into five groups. there were 12 birds in the blank control group, 4/91 group, LDT3-A group, non-vaccinated group and 36 birds in the other four groups. birds in the blank control group received no challenge virus. a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (IDEXX Laboratory, Inc., Westbrook, ME, U.S.A.) was developed following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. 1 106 cells were stained with mouse anti-Chicken CD4-PE and CD8a-FITC antibodies. three live, attenuated vaccines were purchased commercially. each vaccine was reconstituted according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. serotype of LDT3-A was different from Mass-type vaccines. experimental design Seven-day-old SPF birds were randomly divided into five groups. there were 12 birds in the blank control group, 4/91 group, LDT3-A group, non-vaccinated group and 36 birds in the other four groups. birds in the blank control group received no challenge virus. a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (IDEXX Laboratory, Inc., Westbrook, ME, U.S.A.) was developed following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. 1 106 cells were stained with mouse anti-Chicken CD4-PE and CD8a-FITC antibodies. the antibodies of vaccinated groups were significantly higher (P0.05 or P0.01) than those of non-vaccinated groups. at 7 dpi, the 4/91 and H120 groups showed the highest CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes in peripheral blood of vaccinated chickens. at 14 dpi, the percentages of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes in the 4/91 group were the highest. the percentages of peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes in the 4/91 group were the highest. the birds challenged with GX-YL5, GX-GL11079 and GX-NN09032 strains exhibited more exudates in the trachea. no clinical signs or gross lesions were observed in any birds in the blank control group. -YL5 (serotype 1) 0 (0/12) 16.7 (2/12) 83.7 GX-GL11079 (serotype 2) 0 (0/12) 25.0 (3/12) 75.0 GX-NN09032 (serotype 5) 0 (0/12) 16.7 (2/12) 83.7 LDT3-A (unknown) GX-YL5 (serotype 1) 8.3 (1/12) 33.3 (4/12) 66.7 GX-GL11079 ( the viral loads in trachea and kidney of the 4/91 group challenged with the same serotype strain GX-NN09032 maintained a low level of less than 102 copies/l. none of the viruses was detected in the trachea or kidney samples from the blank control group. at 21 dpi, the LDT3-A group showed the highest antibody level (P0.01), while the H120 group showed a medium level. the 4/91 group presented the lowest level (P0.05). peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected at 0, 7, 14 and 21 dpi. error bars indicate the means SE per group. the results showed that the protection rates of H120, 4/91 and LDT3-A vaccines against the infection of GX-YL5, GX-GL11079 and GX-NN09032 strains were 41.7\u201358.3%, 75.0\u201383.7% and 66.7\u201375.0% respectively. the protection rate of the 4/91 group against the challenge of GX-NN09032 strains was the highest (83.7%) viral loads in trachea and kidney of vaccinated groups were significantly lower than those in the kidney. in all vaccinated groups, the viral loads in the trachea and kidney of the vaccinated groups were significantly (P0.01) lower than those in the kidney. l and were significantly lower than those of the H120 group and the LDT3-A group at 5 dpc. the birds were vaccinated at 7 days of age with H120, 4/91 and LDT3-A vaccines. at 5 dpc, the protection rates of vaccines against the challenges of the three prevalent IBV isolates were 41.7\u201358.3%, 75\u201383.7% and 66.7\u201375.0% respectively. none of the three attenuated vaccines could provide complete protection against all the current prevalent isolates. but vaccine 4/91 offered the best immune protection of the three and vaccine LDT3-A had better protection than the H120 vaccine. a compliant IB vaccine must be not less than 80% against a virulent challenge. previous studies demonstrated that the H120 vaccine couldn\u2019t provide sufficient protection against the field isolates in china [6, 13,14,15, 24] CONFLICT OF INTEREST The authors declare no conflicts of interest."}
