{"summary": "large animal models offer unique biological and experimental advantages that have been and continue to be of great value to the understanding of biological and immunological processes. the humble cow, the underestimated pig and the unassuming chicken have greatly influenced our current understanding of human immunology. Edward Jenner published a booklet entitled \"An Inquiry into the Causes and Effects of the Variolae Vaccinae\" he was the first person known to vaccinate against smallpox (3) protecting his family against the virus even after numerous exposures (3). pigs also played an important role in early vaccinology studies. by the late 1800s swine plague or hog cholera, CSFV was killing hundreds of thousands of pigs across the word. the first report of a biosynthesized polypeptide vaccine was published in 1981 (22) the structural protein VP3 of FMDV was cloned and expressed in E. coli and the purified protein used to vaccinate six cattle and two swine. new technologies have only helped to highlight the importance of farm animals in vaccine development. avian bursa of Fabricius named after Hieronymus Fabricius of Aquapendente (30) is a sac-like structure located in the cloacal passage of the bird and its function remained elusive until well into the Twentieth century. the bone marrow in mammals was shown to be the equivalent of the bursa in birds. cows can be immunized with a single HIV Env trimer. this results in potent HIV-specific nAbs. chickens have serum IgM and IgA both of which are homologs of their mammalian counterparts. engineers have solved crystal structures of three new bovine Fab fragments. they have solved crystal structures of three new bovine Fab fragments. they propose that varying the length of the stalk and the positions and number of disulphide links in the knob may help drive antibody diversity. between 3 (in normal individuals) and 60% (in certain pathologies) of human peripheral blood lymphocytes have been shown to be CD4/CD8 double positive (DP) T cells. however, the presence of CD4/CD8 DP T cells in many animals makes it impossible to ignore these cells. cytokine profiles defining TH1/TH2 responses to antigens in cattle are more similar to human responses. dendritic cells (DC) as such, and their role in immunity were first described in the 1970s. in 1995, Ralph Steinman published a series of papers identifying an important and until then uncharacterized marker expressed on pseudo-afferent lymph veiled cells (also called ALDC) dendritic macrophages that are involved in long term immunological reactions differed from \u201cclassical\u201d peritoneal macrophages (67), thus indicating that DC and macrophages were different cell types (67) several years before Steinman's observations (68) swine and human DC/macrophage populations have recently been described (71) a subset of bovine T cells expressed MHC class II and co-stimulatory molecules on their surface, a characteristic normally attributed to macrophages, B cells and DC but not T cells (83). this function of bovine T cells was subsequently reported in pigs (84) and much later in mouse (85) and human (86\u201388) T cells. inflammatory responses in mouse models do not correlate with human inflammatory disease. pigs, pigs, and chickens are useful, valid, and valuable models to study human infectious diseases and important clinical targets in their own right. pigs have been used in rotavirus research to study disease pathogenesis and identify virus-specific IgA and ASC as correlates for protection and vaccine efficacy in children. the presence and potential reactivation of endogenous retroviruses has very important consequences in both allo- and xeno-transplantation. the main mechanism for organ and tissue rejection has been proposed to involve arteriosclerosis, or thickening of the arterial walls. this process if thought to be caused by activated and allo-reactive lymphocytes that migrate over time to the transplanted organ (104). developmental immunology studies in laboratory mice have underpinned many concepts of immune tolerance and the generation of immune responses in the neonate. studies using mice have shown the efficacy of vaccines against FMDV. however, these efficacy studies have failed to be translated to the target species (cattle and pigs) studies have shown the effectiveness of vaccines against FMDV. the availability of reagents to study immune cells and processes in mice far out competes the availability of these reagents for large animals. the use of these animals in research is not difficult as long as the appropriate facilities and reagents are available. authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
