{"summary": "PRRSV is an enveloped, positive-stranded RNA virus. it belongs to the genus Porartevirus, family Arteriviridae and order Nidovirales (1). rapid evolutionary rate often leads to the emergence of PRRSV variants. the negative immunomodulatory mechanism induced by type 2 PRRSV has been linked to the induction of interleukin-10 (IL-10), which in turn provides an immunological niche for Treg expansion. however, the immunosuppressive effect of PRSSV might not be solely associated with the induction of IL-10 and Treg. iency virus (HIV)-induced IL-1Ra production weakens inflammatory processes through inhibition of IL-1 synthesis in human monocytes. the impact of PRRSV-induced IL-1Ra on porcine innate and adaptive immune functions were investigated. orcine IL-10 mAb (945A4C437B1, IgG1) was purchased from Biosource (Camarillo, CA, USA) anti-porcine CD25 mAb (K231.3B2, IgG1), goat anti-mouse IgG1-FITC and goat anti-mouse IgG2a-FITC were purchased from AbD Serotec (Kidlington, UK) non-adherent cells, referred as peripheral blood lymphocytes, were collected and stored at 5 107 cells/mL in liquid nitrogen until needed. remaining adherent cells were cultured with 10 ng/mL porcine recombinant IL-4 (R&D system, Minneapolis, MN, USA) the antibody pre-treated MoDC (2 106 cell) were inoculated with inactivated E. coli-FITC in complete RPMI at a MoDC:E. coli ratio of 1:50 for 10 min at 37\u00b0C. the cell pellet was washed twice with PBSA and subjected to flow cytometric analyses. pre-treated PBL or PBMC were inoculated with 1 g/mL PHA (Sigma Chemical Co.), DMSO (Sigma Chemical Co.), 0.1 m.o.i. of CSFV or mock (SK6 cell lysate) for 48 (IFN- production) or 96 h (proliferation) the cells were harvested and subjected to immunofluorescent staining and flow cytometric analyses. PBMC and MoDC were stained and permeabilized with 1:100 anti-PRRSV N mAb (SDOW-17) diluted in Reagent B (Leucoperm, AbD serotec) in the dark at the 4\u00b0C for 30 min followed by PBSA washing. the cells (1 106 cells/well) were harvested and transferred into round-bottom plates and then washed twice with FACs buffer. diluted in FACS buffer was added to the cells and incubated in the dark at 4\u00b0C for 30 min. for secondary staining, 1:500 of streptavidin-APC or 1:100 of goat anti-mouse IgG1-Alexaflur 647 was added to the cells. cells were gated at least 1 105 cell/events for each analysis. qPCR reaction was carried out as previously described (26, 35\u201337) differences in Ct values between the treatment groups were analyzed by the formula 2Ct. Viruses and Cells Type 2 PRRSV strain 01NP1 (33) and classical swine fever virus (CSFV) were cultured and titrated in MARC-145 (CU-VDL) and SK6 (CU-VDL) cells. all viruses and mock-infected cell lysates were stored at 80\u00b0C until needed. biotinylated anti-porcine IFN- mAb (P2C11) was purchased from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA, USA) anti-porcine IL-10 mAb (945A4C437B1, IgG1) was purchased from Biosource (Camarillo, CA, USA) anti-porcine CD25 mAb (K231.3B2, IgG1), goat anti-mouse IgG1-FIT the PBMC were resuspended at 5 x 106 cells/mL in Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Media (GIBCO, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and incubated at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 2 h. non-adherent cells, referred as peripheral blood lymphocytes, were collected and stored at 5 107 cells/mL in liquid nitrogen until needed. IL-1Ra antibody (R&D system, clone AF780) or polyclonal goat IgG isotype control antibody (R&D system) at 2 h post-inoculation to neutralize PRRSV-induced IL-1Ra. the antibody pre-treated MoDC (2 106 cell) were further incubated with inactivated E. coli-FITC in complete RPMI at a MoDC:E. coli ratio of 1:50 supernatant-treated PBMC were inoculated with 0.1 m.o.i. of type 2 PRRSV or mock (MARC-145 cell lysate) at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 2 h. the cells were harvested and subjected to immunofluorescent staining. in some experimental conditions, cells were pre-treated with final concentration of 10 ng/mL polyclonal goat anti-porcine IL-1Ra antibody (R&D system, clone AF780) or polyclonal goat IgG isotype control antibody (R&D system) at 2 h post-inoculation to neutralize PRRSV-induced IL-1Ra. the antibody pre-treated MoDC (2 106 cell) were further incubated with pre-treated PBMC were inoculated with 0.1 m.o.i. of type 2 PRRSV or mock (SK6 cell lysate) at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 2 h. the cells were harvested and subjected to immunofluorescent staining. MC (2 106 cells/well) or MoDC (1 106 cells/well) were cultured with 0.1 m.o.i. of type 2 PRRSV or mock (MARC-145 cell lysate) in 24-well plates at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 48 h. the cultures were measured for the level of PRRSV-induced IL-1Ra by porcine IL-1Ra ELISA. 1:500 of streptavidin-PE, 1:500 of streptavidin-PEcy7, 1:100 of goat anti-mouse IgG1-FITC or 1:100 of goat anti-mouse IgG2a-FITC were added to the cells and incubated in the dark at 4\u00b0C for 30 min. for primary staining, the cells were then fixed and permeabilized with 50% reagent A (Leucoperm, Serotec), total mRNAs were isolated from the cells by using the total mRNA extraction kit (Biotechrabbit, Germany) the extracted mRNAs were assayed by NanoDrop (Thermo scientific, USA) and converted to cDNA using a cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen, USA) levels of porcine IFNA, IL1, IL6, TBET, GATA3, RORGT, FOXP3, and GAPDH expression were quantified by S TTA-GGA-GAC-TCT-GGG-TGA-AC GATA3 XM_022745494.1 F: ACA-GAC-CCC-TGA-CCA-TGA-AG 193 (35) R: GGA-GAT-GTG-GCT-GAG-AGA-GG FOXP3 XM_021079539.1 F: CTC-CTA-CTC-CCT-GCT-GGC-AAA phagocytic activity of MoDC could be restored by the neutralization of IL-1Ra. the blockade of IL-1Ra in the culture increased SLA-DR (MHC II) and restored CD86 expression. neutralization of IL-1Ra restored IFNA and IL1 gene expressions up to the levels observed in the control treatments (mock) however, neutralization of IL-1Ra appeared to have little effect on the level of IL6 gene expression. PRRSV-induced IL-1Ra inhibited (A) IFNA and (B) IL1 but not IL6 expression. restimulation of PBMCs with same antigen significantly upregulated TBET expression. IL-1Ra neutralization was shown to restore or even increase expressions of TBET and GATA3 compared with CSFV restimulation alone. PRRSV-induced IL-1Ra decreased expressions of (C) TBET and (D) GATA3, (E) but not FOXP3 gene expressions. supernatants from type 2 PRRSV- or mock (MARC-145 cell lysate)-infected MoDC were pretreated with anti-IL-1Ra Ab. the presence of PRRSV-infected MoDC supernatant significantly reduced the number of proliferating CD4+, CD8+, and CD4+CD8+ cells in the PHA-stimulated cultures. PRRSV-induced IL-1Ra inhibited PHA-induced proliferation of the (A) CD4+, (B) CD8+, and (C) CD4+CD8+ subpopulations. the presence of PRRSV-induced IL-1Ra in the culture system inhibited mitogen-induced and virus-specific lymphocyte proliferation. however, the negative effect of PRRSV-induced IL-1Ra on IFN- produced by T lymphocytes was not significant. PRRSV-induced IL-1Ra was not involved in suppression of IFN--producing T lymphocytes in both (A) polyclonal and (B) recalled CSFV responses. PBMC were cultured with PHA, CSFV or controls for 48 h. data represents mean SD from 5 pigs. PRRSV-induced IL-1Ra decreased numbers of (A) Treg, (B) but not IL-10-producing T lymphocytes. PBMC were cultured in the presence of type 2 PRRSV or mock. PRRSV-induced IL-1Ra inhibited (A) phagocytic activity, (B) SLA-DR and (C) CD86 expression. moDC were cultured with type 2 PRRSV or mock, in presence of anti-IL-1Ra. PRRSV-induced IL-1Ra inhibited (A) IFNA and (B) IL1, (C) but not IL6 expression. moDC were cultured with type 2 PRRSV or mock in the presence of anti-IL-1Ra Ab. restimulation of PBMCs with same antigen significantly upregulated TBET expression. IL-1Ra neutralization was shown to restore or even increase expressions of TBET and GATA3 compared with CSFV restimulation alone. supernatants from type 2 PRRSV- or mock (MARC-145 cell lysate)-infected MoDC were pretreated with anti-IL-1Ra Ab for 2 h prior to addition into the culture system. PBMC obtained from CSFV-immunized pigs were in vitro reactivated with CSFV or mock (SK6 cell lysate), in the presence of pretreated supernatants. the presence of PRRSV-infected MoDC supernatant significantly reduced the number of proliferating CD4+, CD8+, and CD4+CD8+ cells in the PHA-stimulated cultures. the results indicated that PRRSV-induced IL-1Ra was involved in suppression of PHA-induced T lymphocyte proliferation. the presence of IL-1Ra in the culture system significantly inhibited mitogen-induced and virus-specific lymphocyte proliferation. however, the negative effect of PRRSV-induced IL-1Ra on IFN- produced by T lymphocytes was not significant. PRRSV-induced IL-1Ra was involved in the Induction of Treg, but not IL-10-Producing T lymphocytes. PBMC were infected with PRRSV or mock, and in the presence or absence of anti-IL-1Ra Ab. PRRSV-induced IL-1Ra decreased numbers of (A) Treg, (B) but not IL-10-producing T lymphocytes. PBMC cultured in the presence of type 2 PRRSV or mock. inhibition of phagocytic activity and APC maturation by PRRSV-induced IL-1Ra strongly supported the role of IL-1Ra in PRRSV immunopathogenesis. IL-1Ra downregulated IFNA and IL1 gene expression by PRRSV was not dependent with IL-1Ra. blocking of IL-1R signaling pathway inhibited Th1 and Th2 differentiations. IL-1Ra neutralization resulted in a higher level of TBET and GATA3 expressions. a basal level of IL-1Ra is requested to balance the Th differentiation. transcriptomic analysis of PRRSV-immunized pigs revealed the IFN- pathway was essential for activation of anti-viral defense mechanism (75). IL-10, a potent inhibitory cytokine, is known as one of the major PRRSV-induced immunosuppressive mechanisms (22, 49, 50). development and function of Treg are distinct among Th lymphocyte lineages (82) expression of FOXP3 per se is not sufficient to maintain Treg phenotype and their functions. other costimulatory regulators including PD-L1, CTLA-4, IL-2, IL-10, and TGF- collectively contribute to stable Treg phenotype. PRRSV-induced IL-1Ra is responsible for negative immune responses in the infected pigs. this study highlights the negative immunomodulatory effects of PRRSV-induced IL-1Ra on both porcine and adaptive immune functions. all methods and animal studies were approved by Chulalongkorn University Animal Care and Use Committee, Chulalongkorn University. authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
