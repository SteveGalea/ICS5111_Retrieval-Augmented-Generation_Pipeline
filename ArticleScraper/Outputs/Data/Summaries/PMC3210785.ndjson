{"summary": "CCoV is a single positive-stranded RNA virus responsible for enteric disease in puppies [1]. CCoV-I and \u2013II share about 90% sequence identity in most of their genome. CCoV-II is the only one which grows in cell cultures. previous studies showed that SIRT1 is a key regulator of cell defenses and survival in response to stress [8] and deacetylates and represses FOXO1 dependent apoptosis [9]. other authors reported that SIRT1 inhibited the ability of FOXO3A to induce cell death. SIRT3 regulates acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 [18], [19] and glutamate dehydrogenase [20], [21]. Moreover, sirtuins also regulate viral transcription. the aim of the present study was to analyze the modulations of sirtuins. cell line was maintained free of mycoplasma and of bovine viral diarrhoea virus. CCoV type II strain S/378 was used for the study. virus titers were determined by end point dilution tests. the relative amount of mRNA level was quantified throughout gel-Doc Phosphorimanger and Quantity One software (Bio-Rad) the relative amount of mRNA level was normalized by the band intensity of -actin. the cell pellets were homogenized directly into lysis buffer.

TRAIL antibody recognized the 28\u201330 KDa bands for TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 respectively. -actin was used as a loading control. the bars represent the mean SEM of the results from three separate experiments. CCoV-II infection modulates SIRT4 protein expression in mitochondrial fraction. cell lysates were collected at the indicated times p.i. and equal amounts of proteins from each sample were subjected to Western blot analysis and probed for SIRT3. TIM50 was used as a loading control. the expression of pro-apoptotic member bax significantly decreased in the cytosolic fraction from 12 h p.i. onwards. in the mitochondrial fraction, significantly increased at the same times (P0.001), indicating the translocation of this protein from the cytosol into the mitochondrial compartment following infection. significant differences between CCoV-II-infected cells and control cells are indicated by probability P. **P 0.01 and ***P 0.001. the bars represent the mean SEM of the results from three separate experiments. sirtuins are considered key regulators of cell survival and apoptosis. it is established that sirtuins interact with and regulate the activity of FOXO gene family proteins. targeted deacetylation of histones is thought to occur through its interaction with specific DNA binding factors, such as FOXO3A and FOXO1. TRAIL, FasL and Fas, which are further transcriptional targets of FOXO, can control cell cycle and apoptosis [31], [33]\u2013[37]. TRAIL expression level increased at 12 h p.i. when CCoV-II-induced apoptosis starts, as previously described. mitochondrial sirtuins, SIRT3 and SIRT4, are able to inhibit cell death by maintaining constant mitochondrial NAD+ levels following stress. apoptotic protein bax translocates from the cytosol to the mitochondrial compartment, while the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 was down-regulated in the cytosolic compartment. TRAIL may be a primary mediator of CCoV-II-induced apoptosis. the mitochondrion plays a critical role in a host defense mechanism. we believe that both the activation of extrinsic apoptotic pathway and the activation of intrinsic apoptotic pathway occurred during CCoV-II infection."}
