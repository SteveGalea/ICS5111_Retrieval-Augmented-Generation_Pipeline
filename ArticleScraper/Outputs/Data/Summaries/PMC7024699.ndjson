{"summary": "e-mails were retrieved from the archives of the mailbox of the WPRO IHR CP. the e-mails covered communications from September 2006 to January 2017. the contents of e-mails received from NFPs and external partners were reviewed to determine the disease or public health hazard reported. 64 e-mails (7%) included fax notices, surveillance reports that did not list recipients and e-mails sent to a very large group of recipients. 5809 (27.4%) were from Member States in the Western Pacific Region, 508 (2.4%) were from Member States and areas outside the Western Pacific Region, 2881 (2.4%) were from WHO IHR CPs in WHO headquarters or other WHO regional offices. all states in the western Pacific region made at least one notification of a potential PHEIC to the WPRO IHR CP during this period. forty-three diseases and one nuclear accident were reported to the WPRO IHR CP. the most frequently reported diseases were tuberculosis (53 events), measles (29 events), chlamydia (16 events), Legionnaire\u2019s disease (15 events), MERS (14 events), Zika virus disease (12 events) and Ebola virus disease (10 events for sharing notice of travellers under monitoring with low risk exposure and two events for contact tracing) between 1 April 2013 and 12 January 2017, 166 updates of H7N9 were posted on EIS. sixty-two out of 177 updates were posted on the same day. median time from reporting to EIS posting was 1.62 days. five countries consulted with the WPRO IHR CP about 14 events that either did not require notification as a potential PHEIC or did not have enough information to determine if PHEIC criteria had been met. none of these events was declared as a PHEIC. in 36 instances, NFPs made requests for information from another NFP. these communications usually took place when NFPs wanted to verify media reports of diseases in another country or ask questions following an EIS posting. 90 postings from 24 countries or areas in the western Pacific Region were shared on EIS as of January 2017. IHR Exercise Crystal has been held annually from 2008 to 2016, with exception of 2009 when the real-world event of pandemic influenza A(H1N1) tested IHR communication between countries and WHO. the scope of IHR Exercise Crystal has been evolving with increased complexity. 2011 Notification of a potential PHEIC (severe acute respiratory infection of unknown etiology) and share the information on EIS. 2014 Joint exercise between NFPs and INFOSAN emergency contact points on notification and information sharing of an outbreak of Verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli infection caused by an internationally distributed food product. twenty-three countries participated in the exercise that simulated the scenario of an imported case of EVD. the majority of the countries were able to complete the expected actions, including sharing national EVD guidelines and response plans. timely communication during epidemics exemplifies importance of investment in public health preparedness in peaceful times. increasing numbers of NFPs could complete tasks of making notifications and developing an EIS posting in the exercises. this report presents a conservative picture of the extent of IHR communication within the region. IHR communication has played a pivotal role in communicating public health risks between countries and WHO and among countries."}
