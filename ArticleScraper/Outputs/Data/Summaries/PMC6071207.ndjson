{"summary": "porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is a highly contagious swine disease characterized by acute watery diarrhea and vomiting in piglets. since late 2010, the highly virulent porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has emerged and has attacked neonatal piglets in china [4] since late 2010, outbreaks of highly virulent PED were reported in North America and East Asia [5,6], including in Taiwan [7]. the naturally assembled S protein forms a homotrimeric structure with several predicted glycosylation sites [12]. the S1 domain contributes to receptor recognition, enteropathogenicity, and immunogenicity, as it contains the dominant neutralizing epitopes on the S protein of PEDV. baculovirus is a very stable DNA virus, which can be stored at 4 \u00b0C for up to 5 days. baculovirus displaying a heterologous protein on its surface could be a novel tool for the development of new generation of vaccines. several immunogens have been generated using the recombinant baculovirus display strategy. the titer of the PEDV-PT-P6&7 viral stock was determined as 105 TCID50/mL by performing a 10-fold serial diluted inoculation on Vero cells. the nucleotide sequence of S gene derived from the Taiwan G2b PEDV-PT strain was codon optimized for insect cells and synthesized by ProTech. full-length spike (S) and S1 genes are driven by the TriEx promoter. the pTriEx-S contains the codon optimized S1 gene associated with GP64 transmembrane domain (TM-B) and the GP64 cytoplasmic domain (CTD-B) for membrane anchoring. both constructs were also inserted with an mCherry fluorescent protein gene driven by the SV40-pag promoter as a reporter. signals were detected by using mouse anti-6xHis-tag monoclonal antibody (1:5000 dilution, EnoGene, New York, NY, USA) the goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to HRP (1:5000 dilution, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) were used as secondary antibodies for signal detection. the protein bands were detected by using the ClarityTM Western ECL Blotting Substrates. the grids were stained with 2% phosphotungstic acid (PTA) for 1 min. the grids were incubated with 6 nm gold-conjugated anti-mouse IgG for 1 h. piglets were labeled by ear tags, stoc. each group of pigs was intramuscularly injected with 2 mL control medium, 2 mL of 109 TCID50/mL S1-Bac, or 2 mL of 109 TCID50/mL S-Bac on both sides of the thigh, two times at a two-week interval. at day 28, all pigs were orally challenged with 5 mL of 105 TCID50/mL PEDV-PT- the plates were washed six times with 200 L washing buffer (KPL, SeraCare) after incubation. antibodies were detected by either using 1000 diluted horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (KPL, SeraCare) or HRP-conjugated goat anti-pig IgG (KPL, SeraCare) in blocking buffer. ISA for Detecting Mucosal IgA Each rectal swab was resuspended in 1 mL PBS and was two-fold diluted in blocking buffer (KPL, SeraCare) the fecal swab from challenged pig was used as the positive control. RNA extraction was performed by QIAcube HT (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA, USA) plasma samples were incubated at 56 \u00b0C for 30 min to inactivate the complement. the procedure of the neutralizing assay was performed as previously published with some modifications. the highly virulent PEDV Pintung 52 passage 5 (PEDV-PT-P5) was used for preparation of the PEDV-PT passage 6 (PEDV-PT-P6) and PEDV-PT passage 7 (PEDV-PT-P7) in vero cells. a viral challenge stock of PEDV-PT-P6&7 was prepared by admixing 1:1 ratio of the PEDV-PT-P6 and PEDV-PT-P7 supernatants. the plasmids were constructed according to the instruction manual of the In-Fusion\u00ae HD Cloning Kit (Clontech Laboratories Inc., Fremont, CA, USA) pTriEx-S contains the codon optimized full-length S gene associated with GP64 transmembrane domain (TM-S) and the PEDV S cytoplasmic domain (CTD-S) for membrane anchoring. both constructs were also inserted with an mCherry fluorescent protein Western Blotting The infected cell lysates were subjected to gradient sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel (HR gradient gel solution, TOOLS, Taipei, Taiwan) after electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes. the protein bands were detected by using the ClarityTM Western ECL Blotting Substrates. viral particles were collected and washed with PBS to remove sucrose. aliquot of 10 L virus particles preparation was loaded onto a carbon-coated grid. grids were stained with 2% phosphotungstic acid (PTA) for 1 min, then the excess PTA was dried out. the blood was collected at day 0 (pre-priming), 14 (2 weeks after priming) and 28 (2 weeks post-boosting) for evaluating the change of PEDV-specific plasma IgG. all piglets were labeled by ear tags, stochastically separated into three groups. pigs of each group were weighed every two weeks. antibodies were detected by either using 1000 diluted horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (KPL, SeraCare) or HRP-conjugated goat anti-pig IgG. ABTS\u00ae Peroxidase Substrate System (KPL, SeraCare) was added each well at RT for 10 min. reaction stopped by adding 50 L stopping solution (KPL, SeraCare) optical density (OD) was read at a wavelength of 405 nm by EMax Plus Microplate Reader. the real-time PCR condition was 95 \u00b0C for 2 min and 45 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 15 s and 55 \u00b0C for 15 s and 55 \u00b0C for 15 s. 2.12. Neutralizing assay The plasma samples of each pig were incubated at 56 \u00b0C for 30 min. the neutralizing titers of each plasma were calculated as the reciprocal of the highest dilutions without CPE. the differences between each group were statistically compiled with SAS 9.4 (Statistical Analysis System, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) the molecular weights of S and S1 proteins were approximately 170\u2013200 kDa and 90\u2013100 kDa respectively. the corresponding molecular weights of S and S1 proteins were approximately 170\u2013200 kDa and 90\u2013100 kDa, respectively. systemic PEDV S-specific blood IgG levels were determined at day 0 (pre-priming), 14 (2 weeks post-priming) and 28 (2 weeks post-boosting) in mice using a PEDV S-based indirect ELISA. anti-PEDV S protein IgG levels were detected by the ELISA. the X axis represents the day post vaccination. the Y axis shows the sample-to-positive control ratios. the error bars represent the SD values of each group in different time points. plasma IgG was evaluated at day 0 (pre-priming), 14 (2 weeks post-priming) and 28 (2 weeks post-boosting) the mean S/P ratios of systemic IgG levels of pigs were significantly elevated to 0.63 0.09 and 0.77 0.16 in both S-Bac and S1-Bac groups. the data is shown as the mean values of the sample-to-positive control ratios (S/P ratio) the error bars represent the SD values of each group at different time points. the solid line with square icon and the gray line with round icon represent the climbing trend of IgG level in the control group. no neutralizing antibody against the PEDV-PT strain was detected in the control group. at day 28 (2 weeks post-boosting), the neutralizing titers of the S1-Bac and S-Bac groups were significantly higher than that of the control group, 1:6 4.9. the piglets were challenged with 5 105 TCID50 PEDVPT-P6&7 at 9 weeks old. the Y axis is the averaged body weights of five piglets in each group. the error bars represent the SD values of each group in different time points. four of five (4/5) pigs presented no clinical symptoms during the study. one pig had soft feces (score 1) at 6 DPC and semifluid feces (score 2) at 11 DPC. each piglet was orally challenged with 5 105 TCID50 PEDV-PT-P6&7 at day post vaccination 28. most pigs in the S-Bac group had no detectable viral shedding during 0\u201310 DPC, excepting 1 pig, who exhibited an intermittent viral shedding of 4.5 log10 copies/mL at 6 DPC. the limit of detection for this probe-based quantitative real-time RT PCR was 1.8 log10 and is labeled as the gray zone. of the S and S1 proteins were observed at the sizes around 170\u2013200 kDa and 90\u2013100 kDa respectively. as a negative control, no detectable signal was observed in the lysate of Sf21 cells infected with wild-type AcMNPV virus. apex of both S-Bac, S1-Bac and wild-type baculovirus (wild type-Bac, Figure 3c) virions showed positive colloid gold signals of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) full-length S and S1 proteins on the surface of recombinant S-Bac (a); S1-Bac (b); and wild-type Bac (c), respectively. no statistical difference of systemic PEDV specific IgG levels was observed between the S1-Bac and S-Bac groups. serum samples of the mice were collected three times in two-week intervals, including day 0 (pre-priming), 14 (2 weeks post-priming) and 28 (2 weeks post-boosting. the average neutralizing antibody titer in the S-Bac group was elevated and reached 1:30 14. the shift of neutralizing titers in the blood of control mice is represented as a solid line with square icons and a gray line with round icons. the error bars represent the SD values of each group at different time points. the systemic IgG levels of piglets were detected every two weeks at day 0 (pre-priming), day 14 (2 weeks post-priming) and day 28 (2 weeks post-boosting) by using the PEDV S-based ELISA. the data is presented as mean OD values from five pigs. the error bars represent the SD values of each group at different time points. the solid line with square icons and gray line with round icons represent the climbing trend of IgA level in the control group. the piglets were vaccinated twice at 5 weeks old and 7 weeks old. the piglets were challenged with 5 105 TCID50 PEDVPT-P6&7 at 9 weeks old. no clinical signs were observed in any groups. all pigs in the control group had 5\u20136 days of watery diarrhea (score 3) and recovered at 9 DPC. the appearance of clinical signs was postponed to 3 to 4 DPC. in the S-Bac immunized group, the appearance of clinical signs was postponed to 3 to 4 DPC. pigs in the control group started to shed PEDVs into the stool with the mean value of the copy number of 4.6 0.19 log10 copies/mL at 1 DPC. peak viral shedding was 7.6 0.57 log10 copies/mL at 5 DPC. pigs in the control group had no detectable viral shedding during 0\u201310 DPC. baculoviruses displaying the full-length S protein (S-Bac) and the S1 domain (S1-Bac) of PEDV-PT were successfully generated in this study. piglets present milder clinical symptoms with significantly lower fecal viral shedding than those in the control group. intramuscular vaccination with S-Bac elicits superior protection against PEDV over intramuscular S1-Bac vaccination in piglets. peptide, transmembrane domain (TM) or cytoplasmic tail domain (CTD) of GP64 in attempt to present large, complex foreign proteins and simple peptides are available [29,46] using the traditional chimeric GP64 display strategy, the S1-Bac has been successfully generated and confirmed. this is the first evidence showing the full-length S protein of coronavirus could be successfully displayed on the surface of the baculovirus by utilizing PEDV studies using full-length ectodomain trimeric S protein [40] or different truncated S proteins derived from different G2b PEDVs were combined with commercial adjuvants as subunit vaccine regimens. piglets vaccinated with S-Bac can be elicited higher neutralizing antibody titers and good protective efficacy over the pigs. baculovirus display S protein comprising both S1 and S2 regions is crucial for generating protective immunity against PEDVs. the viral particle of baculovirus is able to evoke robust innate immune responses by regulating cytokines such as interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) [26]. adjuvants are capable of either boosting immunity or elevating common mucosal immunity should be considered."}
