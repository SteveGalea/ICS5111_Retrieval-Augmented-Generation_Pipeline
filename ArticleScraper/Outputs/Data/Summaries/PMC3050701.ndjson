{"summary": "the aim of this study was to determine the analgesic and sensorial benefits of two different amylmetacresol/2,4-dichlorobenzyl alcohol (AMC/DCBA) throat lozenge formulation variants, AMC/DCBA Warm lozenge and AMC/DCBA Cool lozenge, compared with an unflavoured, non-medicated placebo lozenge. 80% of sore throats are caused by viruses and not bacteria. antibiotics are ineffective in most cases and are not recommended for primary treatment of acute sore throat. all AMC/DCBA throat lozenges contain the two core active ingredients, AMC (0.6 mg) and DCBA (1.2 mg), both of which possess antibacterial [8,9], antiviral [10] and local anaesthetic [11] properties. clinical evidence available supports the efficacy and safety of AMC/DCBA throat lozenges in the rapid relief of acute sore throat due to upper respiratory tract infections. more participants took the AMC/DCBA Warm lozenge (58%) agreed that the experience provided by the Warm lozenge was 'comforting' compared with 23% in the control lozenge group (p 0.0001). all patients gave written informed consent and had a sore throat score of 6 on the Throat Soreness Scale at baseline and the presence of tonsillopharyngitis. interventions Patients were randomlyised to receive either one of two AMC/DCBA throat lozenge variants or an unflavoured, non-medicated lozenge. functional impairment scores, emotional and sensorial benefits of the lozenges were also assessed. primary efficacy endpoint was area under the change-from-baseline curve (AUC) in severity of throat soreness from 0 to 2 hours. the difference in the mean AUC for the change from baseline in the severity of throat soreness from 0 to 2 hours was assumed to be of similar magnitude. 75 patients per group would be sufficient to provide 90% power to detect a difference of 0.58 in the mean AUC. randomisation and blinding The method of randomisation used for the assignment of patients to treatment groups was similar to that described previously by McNally et al. scores at 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105 and 120 minutes. all adverse events reported spontaneously by the patient or in response to questioning or observation by the investigator and/or the study nurse pre-dose. 225 patients with acute sore throat due to URTI were enrolled in the study. all patients gave written informed consent and had a sore throat score of 6 on the Throat Soreness Scale at baseline and the presence of tonsillopharyngitis. the placebo lozenge was unflavoured, while the active lozenges were flavoured. primary objective of this study was to determine functional impairment scores, emotional and sensorial benefits of the lozenges. functional measures of difficulty in swallowing and throat numbness were also assessed. the difference in the mean AUC for the change from baseline in the severity of throat soreness from 0 to 2 hours between the two test lozenges and the unflavoured, non-medicated lozenges was assumed to be of similar magnitude. a third-party blinding method was employed, where each patient was blindfolded and provided with a single lozenge (from an opaque blister pack) a medical history, current medical use, therapy history in the past 14 days, baseline TPA and the patient's current medical status were confirmed. patients recorded throat soreness, difficulty in swallowing, throat numbness and sore throat relief scores at 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105 and 120 minutes. questions with binary responses were analysed using chi-square tests. questions on non-numeric ordinal scales were analysed using a proportional odds model using PROC LOGISTIC in SAS with factors for treatment group and centre and a covariate for baseline throat soreness severity. 77 74 74 225 Age (year) (Mean SD) 30.3 12.2 32.4 14.7 32.6 13.2 31.7 13.3 Gender (% male) 41.6 39.2 41.9 40.9 Race (% Caucasian) 97.4 97.3 95.9 96.9 Alcohol drinker (%) 83.1 86.5 75.7 81.8 Current smoker (%) 36.4 37.8 35.1 36.4 Former smoker (%) 26.0 17.6 14.9 19.6 Duration of sore throat ( PP analysis was qualitatively identical to those obtained with the ITT analysis (Table 2).
