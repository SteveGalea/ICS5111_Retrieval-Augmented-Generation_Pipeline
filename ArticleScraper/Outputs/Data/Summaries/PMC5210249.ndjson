{"summary": "primary treatment failure or primary refractory AML is defined by failure to achieve a complete hematologic remission (CR) after one or two courses of induction chemotherapy. the chance of achieving a CR with another standard or conventional treatment is 10\u201320% at best. overall survival rate at 1 year is less than 20%, with a median survival of less than 6 months. the results achieved with the sequential FLAMSA strategy are among the most promising published so far. however, the results are still unsatisfactory in terms of relapse incidence and long-term leukemia control. the high incidence of severe toxicities, related to amsacrine, hamper the overall safety and success of the procedure. sequential regimen combining a short course of intensive chemotherapy based on clofarabine, Ara-C and RIC allogeneic SCT with cyclophosphamide, i.v. busulfan and anti-thymocyte globulin. delayed prophylactic donor lymphocyte infusion (pDLI) in patients with AML in primary treatment failure. patients included in the study proceeded directly to the sequential allogeneic SCT. additional cytoreductive chemotherapy was allowed to control leukemic proliferation while preparation for allogeneic SCT was ongoing. day 0 was designated as the day of graft infusion. assessed at least once a week for cytomegalovirus reactivation. patients were given either cyclosporine A alone, in the case of an HLA-matched sibling donor, or cyclosporine A and mycophenolate mofetil. patients received pDLI if they were in CR after >30 days without immunosuppression. the overall survival rate at 2 years after transplantation was the primary endpoint. secondary endpoints included engraftment, leukemia-free survival, leukemia response rate, relapse rate, treatment-related toxicity, pDLI, acute GvHD and chronic GvHD. survival was defined as survival with no evidence of leukemia after achieving complete remission. we defined NRM as death with no evidence of leukemia relapse or progression. induction chemotherapy itself was administered according to the participating institutions\u2019 preference. additional inclusion criteria were the availability of a matched sibling donor or unrelated stem-cell donor (10-HLA match or a single HLA antigen or allele mismatch) blood products were filtered, irradiated and screened for cytomegalovirus. patients were assessed at least once a week for cytomegalovirus reactivation. for graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis, patients were given either cyclosporine A alone. a single HLA mismatch out of ten (HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-Cw, HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQB1) was allowed at the antigen level. granulocyte - colony-stimulating factor-mobilized peripheral blood stem cells were the graft source recommended per protocol. unmanipulated bone marrow was accepted when peripheral blood stem cells were not available. surviving patients at 2 years is six or less, the hypothesis that 2-year overall survival is >40% is rejected with a target error rate of 0.20. overall survival was defined as the time from allogeneic SCT to death. median marrow blast percentage at transplantation was 20%. in 11 patients the Karnofsky score was 90%, whereas in 13 (54%) it was 90%. chimerism was evaluated on CD3+ T cells on day +28. aspergillus spp. in three patients, bacteria in two, viruses in two, and was of unknown etiology in one patient. two patients had cytomegalovirus reactivation, two had Epstein-Barr virus reactivation, one had corona virus infection and one had BK virus-associated hemorrhagic cystitis. the Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall survival and leukemia-free survival at 2 years were 38% (95% CI: 19\u201356%) and 29% (95% CI: 13\u201348%). at 2 years, the cumulative incidences of relapse/progression were 54.2% (95% CI: 31.8\u201372.0) and 12% (95% CI: 3\u201329%), respectively. grade II acute GVHD developed in one patient after DLI for mixed chimerism. one patient died from extensive chronic GvHD after pDLI. at the last follow-up, two patients were alive in CR. marrow in 21 patients, while only one patient had persistent hypoplasia. median marrow blast percentage at transplantation was 20%. fifteen donors were HLA-identical siblings and nine (38%) were unrelated donors. eight patients developed pneumonia, caused by Aspergillus spp. in three patients. two patients had cytomegalovirus reactivation, two had Epstein-Barr virus reactivation, one had corona virus infection and one had BK virus-associated hemorrhagic cystitis. the Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall survival and leukemia-free survival at 2 years were 38% (95% CI: 19\u201356%) and 29% (95% CI: 13\u201348%). at 2 years, the cumulative incidences of relapse/progression were 54.2% (95% CI: 31.8\u201372.0) and 12% (95% CI: 3\u201329%), respectively. grade II acute GVHD developed in one patient after pDLI and in two after DLI for mixed chimerism. one patient died from extensive chronic GvHD after pDLI. at the last follow-up, two patients were alive in CR. retrospective study recently reported a 1-year NRM incidence of 24% after allogeneic SCT for AML in primary induction failure. however, our sequential conditioning regimen approach still exerts an antileukemic effect in patients with AML in primary treatment failure. relapse remains the principal complication, leading to a 2-year leukemia-free survival rate of 29%. persistent CR after 2 years in these very high-risk patients is an important achievement since retreatment is possible after late relapse. however, a longer interval from transplantation to relapse is associated with an improved survival. preliminary data and case reports suggest that FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors can be effective in the post-transplant setting. we may consider early use of these new therapeutic strategies after allogeneic SCT, alone or in combination with pDLI, in order to enhance the GvL effect. this regimen represents a significant improvement in terms of toxicity, with a low NRM. however, relapse remains the principal complication in these patients."}
