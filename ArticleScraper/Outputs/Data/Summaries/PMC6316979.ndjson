{"summary": "pure titanium and Ti alloys are the most commonly used metals in biomedical materials [2], and naturally form a TiO2 oxidation layer on the material surface. overly thin TiO2 layers cannot protect the pure titanium and Ti alloy beneath the surface. surface treatment and coating are promising methods for improving surface properties of pure titanium and Ti alloys. biomedical instruments may disperse aluminum and vanadium into the human body [8], causing possible health threats. but small amounts of these metals can efficiently improve mechanical properties (e.g., mechanical strength and toughness) of the Ti alloy. samples were annealed through HTA using a high-temperature tube furnace. samples were heated to three different temperatures (i.e., 500, 600, and 700 \u00b0C) another group was treated by LSTO, and three different laser frequencies (100, 300, and 500 kHz) were used to perform LSTO on the TiV coating surface. ness and hydrophobicity of the samples were measured using a Vickers hardness testing machine. the obtained images were analyzed to calculate the contact angle of deionized water for each sample at room temperature. the data for surface hardness and contact angle are both expressed as mean and SD values for at least three independent measurements. the extract was based on the thickness of material extraction ratio of 1.25 cm2/mL 10%. each sample had, at most, 3.5 mL of medium, and was incubated at 37 \u00b0C under 5% CO2 in humidified air. 1.2 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added to dissolve blue crystals in cells for 10 min. supernatants were added at a concentration of 200 L/well in a 96-well plate. absorption at 570 nm was measured using a standard spectrophotometer. the surface morphology of the Ti-V-O coating was examined using a laser scanning microscope (VK-X100, Keyence Co., Osaka, Japan), and a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) the chemical composition of the deposited Ti-V-O films was confirmed through energy dispersive spectroscopy. the retention of bacteria on the coated samples was determined using a fluorescence staining method that employed a SYTO9 nucleic acid stain. first, 500 L of Staphylococcus aureus (2 107 cfu/mL) was added to the sample surface. the retained bacteria were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. extract was based on the thickness of material extraction ratio of 1.25 cm2/mL 10%. each sample had, at most, 3.5 mL of medium, and was incubated at 37 \u00b0C under 5% CO2 in humidified air. the conditioned medium was collected after 72 h of culture and passed through a 0.2 m filter. cytotoxicity tests between the coated samples and uncoated pure-Ti plates were determined by Student\u2019s t test. results revealed that surface morphology and texture of the samples exhibited obvious changes when oxidized after laser surface texturing oxidation (LSTO) the untreated Ti-V-O coating exhibited some microparticles on the surface. when HTA was conducted at 500 \u00b0C, the Ti-V-O coating exhibited blob- and needle-shaped oxides. the oxide changed to stripe-shaped (Figure 2c) Element TiV Ti-V-O 500 \u00b0C Ti-V-O 600 \u00b0C Ti-V-O 700 \u00b0C Ti (at. %) 41.30 25.34 10.41 31.29 V (at. %) 58.70 36.36 32.38 4.28 O (at. %) - 38.30 57.21 64.43. Vickers hardness test results of the uncoated Ti, TiV coating, and LSTO Ti-V-O coating samples. annealing temperature increased from 500 \u00b0C to 700 \u00b0C. the coating hardness increased from Hv 362 50 to Hv 1171 144. Ti-V-O coatings treated by LSTO at frequencies of 100, 300, and 500 kHz exhibited lower COF values. compared with untreated Ti-V-O coatings, the Ti-V-O coatings treated by LSTO showed lower COF values. the Ti-V-O coating annealed at 700 \u00b0C had the lowest water contract angle. when it was annealed at higher temperature, the surface of the deposited oxide layer had greater roughness, increasing its wettability. Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive bacteria) was used to analyze the antibacterial properties of samples coated with Ti-V-O using HTA and LSTO. the longitudinal axis of Figure 10 and Figure 11 is related to the amount of remaining bacteria. a lower value represented greater antibacterial properties. the 100 kHz LSTO Ti-V-O coating showed higher antibacterial properties. the superhydrophobic surface lowered the binding power between the bacteria cell and sample surface. this reduced bacterial cells\u2019 ability to attach to the sample surface. HTA-deposited coating and LSTO Ti-V-O coating showed poor cell proliferation. oxidation states of vanadium could induce DNA damage in cells. low laser frequency possessed high laser energy density. a higher laser frequency is attributed to more flashes from the light source. of the laser settings used to perform LSTO on the coatings, the highest laser frequency was 500 kHz. the Ti-V-O coating mainly consisted of vanadium oxide (V2O5) after oxidation at 600 \u00b0C, the Ti-V-O coating exhibited grain-shaped oxides. the oxygen increased to 64.43%, the titanium content increased from 10.41% to 31.29%, while the vanadium content decreased to 4.28%. annealing effect created under large temperature differences resulted in higher oxygen component ratios, thereby generating more surface oxides. annealing effect created under large temperature differences resulted in higher oxygen component ratios, thereby generating more surface oxides. the titanium alloy thin-film surface exhibited the effect of oxidation, substantially increasing thin film hardness. the results revealed that TiV coatings had greater hardness than the Ti-V-O 300 kHz and Ti-V-O 500 kHz coating. the Ti-V-O coatings treated by LSTO at frequencies of 100, 300, and 500 kHz exhibited lower COF values. the deposited Ti-V-O coatings with coatings deposited at a frequency of 100, 300, and 500 kHz had the lowest COF value. the 300 kHz LSTO coating and 500 kHz LSTO coating had greater surface roughness and wettability than did the Ti (uncoated) sample and the TiV deposited sample. however, the Ti-V-O coating treated under a laser frequency of 100 kHz had a high water contact angle of 140\u00b0, significantly reducing surface wettability. antibacterial effects of the Ti (uncoated) sample, TiV coating, and LTSO Ti-V-O coating were significantly different from the control group\u2014uncoated Ti plate (p 0.01). the difference in antibacterial values between those three samples were small. the 100 kHz LSTO Ti-V-O coating seems to exhibit superior antibacterial properties compared with the 300 kHz and 500 kHz LSTO Ti-V-O coatings. higher longitudinal axis values indicate greater cell proliferation. oxidation states of vanadium could induce DNA damage [21,22] in cells. some researchers have indicated vanadium compounds exert observable toxic effects on body tissues. the surface of the 100 kHz LSTO Ti-V-O thin film sample showed the lotus leaf-like effect, exhibiting superhydrophobic properties. both the HTA and LSTO Ti-V-O coatings showed antibacterial properties."}
