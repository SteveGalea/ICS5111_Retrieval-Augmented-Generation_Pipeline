{"summary": "verapamil is a calcium channel blocker used clinically for hypertension, atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, cluster headache, and angina (1, 2). there has been a growing interest in repurposing verapamil and other efflux pump inhibitors for the treatment of tuberculosis. the MIC may be as high as 600 M (5). apamil derivatives for specific efflux pump inhibition in M. tuberculosis demonstrated various effects on the antimycobacterial activity of rifampin. an unsubstituted derivative resulted in a 2-fold reduction in the MIC of rifampin. ethyl- and propyl-substituted derivatives did not exhibit synergistic interactions with rifampin. groups demonstrated varied effects on the antimycobacterial activity of rifampin. this ranged from no effect to a 2- and 4-fold reduction in the MIC of rifampin. all compounds that led to a 4-fold reduction in the MIC of rifampin were selected for further experiments described in this paper. -diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), saponin, human AB (HAB) serum, fetal calf serum (FCS), and apoptosis detection kits were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA) Components of the mycobacterial growth media, such as Middlebrook 7H9, Middlebrook 7H10, and supplements (albumin, dextrose, catalase [ADC] and oleic stock vials of BCG and M. tuberculosis were prepared from 2-week-old cultures. aliquots were frozen at 80\u00b0C until needed for different experiments. a leukemic monocyte line (THP-1) was cultured in RPMI medium. approximately 10% of the initial number of PBMCs plated were retained as adherent monocytes (>90% CD14+), which were then cultured for 2 to 4 days before infection with M. bovis BCG or M. tuberculosis (Erdman) the amount of formazan formation was quantified by measuring the absorbance at 570 nm using an SLT Rainbow plate reader. Bacteria were harvested on glass fiber filter mats (PerkinElmer Wallac, Inc.), using a Tomtec Mach III cell harvester 96 (Tomtec, Inc., Hamden, CT) the filter mats were air dried, scintillation fluid was added, and the mycobacterial incorporation of tritiated uridine was quantified using a microbeta scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Wallac, Inc.) the absolute numbers of effector CD3+ T cells were calculated by multiplying the total number of viable cells recovered times the percentage of the specific T cell subset detected by flow-cytometric analysis. identifying effects of verapamil and norverapamil on activation of BCG-infected human monocytes. streptomycin were added to flat-bottom 96-well plates (2.5 104/well) and allowed to mature at 37\u00b0C. extracellular bacteria were removed by washing with medium three times. different concentrations of verapamil and norverapamil were added. twenty verapamil analogs were designed and synthesized. five were selected for further studies based on compounds to potentiate the in vitro antimycobacterial effect of rifampin against M. tuberculosis. the StarDrop program (version 5.0; Optibrium Ltd., Cambridge, United Kingdom) was used to predict 90% plasma protein binding (PPB90), log distribution coefficient at pH 7.4 (D7.4) and log water solubility at pH 7.4 (S7.4) the supernatants were capped, mixed on a multiplate vortex for 5 min, and centrifuged for 5 min at 3,200 rpm. the mobile phases consisted of 0.1% formic acid in water (aqueous) and 100% acetonitrile (organic) the MIC was defined as the lowest concentration that inhibits at least 90% of intracellular M. tuberculosis cells. the effects of combinations of verapamil analogs with sub-MICs of isoniazid or rifampin on intracellular M. tuberculosis were studied using infected human macrophages. monocytes and bacterial cultures were grown in a suspension with constant gentle rotation in roller bottles containing Middlebrook 7H9 broth supplemented with 10% ADC enrichment. stock vials of BCG and M. tuberculosis were prepared from 2-week-old logarithmic-phase cultures. a leukemic monocyte line (THP-1) was cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 200 mM l-glutamine and 10% FCS. human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) stored in liquid nitrogen were used to generate monocyte cultures. THP-1 cells in RPMI with l-glutamine were cultured in round-bottom plates at a concentration of 1.5 104/well. drugs were added at different concentrations, and cultures were incubated at 37\u00b0C. after 24 h, MTT assays were performed. mycobacterial growth inhibition was determined using a microbeta scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Wallac, Inc.) the results from the uridine incorporation assay were confirmed by culturing pooled aliquots from triplicate wells of at least one of the multiple experiments. human monocytes were plated (3 104) in 96-well round-bottom microtiter plates. the monocytes were then infected with BCG for 4 h (MOI, 3) extracellular bacteria were removed by washing three times in RPMI medium. different concentrations of verapamil and norverapamil were added. the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. a minimum of 5,000 events were acquired. norverapamil was selected because it has been used as a standard for comparison in various studies on verapamil. in vitro antimycobacterial data, docking score, and physiochemical properties of verapamil analogs a MIC99, MIC for 99% inhibition; b Fold reduction in rifampin MIC99 when evaluated in combination with analogs. the preparation wizard version 5.8 software was used to prepare a model of Rv1258c. five putative binding sites on the prepared model protein were identified using SiteMap (version 2.6) mil and KS21 were m/z 455.3165.2 and 495.4165.1 respectively. the mobile phases consisted of 0.1% formic acid in water (aqueous) and 100% acetonitrile (organic) with an Amour C18 reverse-phase column. the starting phase was 10% acetonitrile for 0.9 min and was then increased to 95% acetonitrile over 0.4 min. the 10% acetonitrile was held for an additional 0.3 s with sub-MICs of isoniazid (INH) or rifampin on intracellular M. tuberculosis were studied using infected human macrophages. a P value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. percent inhibition was calculated as follows: 100 (100 [dpm in the drug-treated cultures/dpm in the untreated cultures]. verapamil and norverapamil do not enhance activation of intracellular mycobacteria. autophagy is not involved in the activities of verapamil and norverapamil on intracellular mycobacteria. verapamil increases microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 expression. verapamil is a known autophagy inducer (26) verapamil and norverapamil inhibit expansion of M. tuberculosis-specific T cells. BMDM were lysed with saponin and the released bacteria quantified by a [3H]-uridine incorporation assay. PBMCs from PPD-positive subjects (n = 5) were labeled with CFSE and stimulated with M. tuberculosis WL for 7 days in the presence or absence of different concentrations of efflux pump inhibitors. viable cells were estimated after counting of cells in aliquots mixed with trypan blue dye. cobacteria were tested using concentrations that have no or minimal cytotoxicities on THP-1 cells. the effects of new analogs on intracellular BCG were not significantly different from those seen with equivalent concentrations of verapamil or norverapamil. effects of new verapamil analogs on intracellular M. tuberculosis and M. tuberculosis-specific immunity. each drug was used at a final concentration of 2.5 M. KSV21 had significantly better activity than MKV4. new verapamil analog KSV21 inhibits mycobacterial efflux pumps. ethidium bromide-stained mycobacteria remove the dye through efflux pumps. ethidium bromide-stained mycobacteria remove the dye through efflux pumps. infected monocytes were cultured in the presence or absence of drugs for 72 h. lysed with saponin and released bacteria quantified using a [3H]uridine incorporation assay. KSV21 is a unique efflux pump inhibitor with potent activity on intracellular BCG and M. tuberculosis. unlike verapamil and norverapamil, KSV21 was shown not to interfere with the proliferation of M. tuberculosis-specific T cells. the highest concentrations selected had no or minimal cytotoxicity on THP-1 cells. the highest concentrations selected had no or minimal cytotoxicity on THP-1 cells. the infected monocytes were cultured for at least 4 h before washing. Activated macrophages release effector molecules, which help them control the growth of intracellular mycobacteria (18\u201323) verapamil and norverapamil did not increase the levels of nitric oxide, IL-1, TNF-, or IFN-. control and atg5mice indicated that the anti-TB effects of verapamil are not due to the induction of autophagy. BMDM from Atg5flox/flox (control) and Atg5flox/flox/flox Lyz-CreA plated on 96-well plates were infected with BCG (A) or M. tuberculosis (Mtb) (B) for 4 h. extracellular bacteria were removed by washing we stimulated CFSE-labeled PBMCs from PPD-positive donors. after 7 days, we measured the number of proliferated and IFN--producing T cells. new analogs were designed and synthesized for structure-activity-relationship studies. they would address the liabilities associated with high doses of verapamil or norverapamil (i.e., hypotension and other toxicities) the activities of new analogs on intracellular mycobacteria were tested using concentrations that have no or minimal cytotoxicities. the activity of the highest concentration of each drug was compared with the activity of a similar concentration of verapamil. the activities of KSV21, MKV4 and MKV9 were comparable with the activity of verapamil. CFSE-labeled PBMCs from PPD-positive donors stimulated PBMCs. MKV9 inhibited M. tuberculosis-specific T cell proliferation and IFN- production. KSV21 and MKV4 showed no effect on M. tuberculosis-specific immunity. Efflux pump inhibitory activities of drugs were measured using an ethidium bromide-based flow-cytometric assay. results show that BCG cultured in the presence of verapamil (100 M) or KSV21 (40 M) had significantly higher fluorescence than the drug-free control (P 0.01). the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) results showed that KSV21 accumulates within macrophages better than verapamil, with intracellular accumulation rates of 26% and 11% respectively. a higher intracellular accumulation rate may make KSV21 a more attractive efflux pump inhibitor. verapamil is one of the major metabolites of verapamil. its serum levels may be equivalent to those of verapamil after first-pass metabolism. higher serum concentrations may cause serious side effects, with high mortality. verapamil inhibits proliferation of T and B cells following polyclonal stimulation with concanavalin, phytohemagglutinin, pokeweed mitogen, and alloantigens. the effects of verapamil on M. tuberculosis-specific T cells have not yet been investigated. KSV21 inhibited intracellular M. tuberculosis. it retained inhibitory activities at concentrations that did not interfere with expansion of M. tuberculosis-specific T cells. interference with the functions of mycobacterial efflux pumps is expected to limit survival inside macrophages. edward et al."}
