{"summary": "levofloxacin injection was given for continuous intravenous infusion treatment. in group B, levofloxacin injection and levofloxacin capsule were given as sequential therapy. cost-effectiveness of the two groups was 17.86 and 13.81 respectively. the global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2010 estimates that there were 2.8 million deaths because of lower respiratory infections globally in 2010. the main etiological agents responsible for ALRI include bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b, Staphylococcus aureus, etc), viruses, and fungi. patients included 52 male and 56 female patients aged between 58 and 76 years; 15 had bronchiectasis with infection, 16 had bacterial pneumonia, 8 had tuberculosis with infection, and 69 had acute attack of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. group A had 200 g intravenous infusion of levofloxacin, bid, for 5 days. group B had ST, which involved 200 g intravenous infusion of levofloxacin, bid, for 5 days. total treatment period for both groups was 10 days. 100 mg/piece levofloxacin injection was 26.9 RMB per piece. 100 mg/piece Levofloxacin capsule had 12 pieces in each box. cost of each group was 18.0 RMB per box. group A had 200 g intravenous infusion of levofloxacin, bid. Upon the improvement of patients\u2019 condition, intra-venous infusion was continued. group B had ST, which involved 200 g intravenous infusion of levofloxacin, bid. indirect costs included patients\u2019 salary loss because of hospitalization or medical treatment. the calculation of total medicine costs was based on the medicine price in our hospital in September 2013. most patients in Group A could benefit from the treatment, with a cure rate of up to 61.1% and an effective rate of 88.9% effective rate = (number of recovered patients + significant patients) in Group B, the cure rate and effective rate were 59.3% and 83.3%, respectively, with no statistically significant differences. however, compared to the group treated with continuous intravenous infusion, clinical results show that Group B had more patients with \u201cimproved\u201d and \u201cno effect bacterial strain clearance rate was 92.6% with no statistically significant differences (P>0.05). cost-effectiveness analysis was carried out as shown in Table 5. cost-effectiveness analysis was to determine the treatment plan with the least cost for certain treatment effect. analysis produced almost the same results, which were shown in Table 6.

Adverse drug reactions During this research, no obvious adverse reactions were found in any of the 2 groups. levofloxacin offers a combination of documented efficacy and tolerability. levofloxacin offers a combination of documented efficacy and tolerability. it has an established place in the routine treatment of bacterial infections."}
