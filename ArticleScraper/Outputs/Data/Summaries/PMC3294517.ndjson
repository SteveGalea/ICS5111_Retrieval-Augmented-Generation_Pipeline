{"summary": "a case of influenza A was defined as illness in a person with positive RT-PCR results for that virus. further subtyping was conducted for 44 of 100 patients with positive influenza A but negative pandemic influenza virus results by NAT. a primary case was defined as illness in the first person in a cabin to report ILI symptoms; a co-primary case, as illness in a person who reported symptom onset within 24 hours after a primary case. public health legislation requires diagnostic laboratories to report confirmed influenza cases to the jurisdictional health department (7). the names of influenza case-patients reported after completion of cruise A were checked against the ship\u2019s manifest. 6 years of age, the epidemiologic investigation focused on this group. all specimens collected from childcare attendees were tested for pandemic and seasonal influenza subtypes. cases per child-sessions at risk and exact Poisson confidence intervals were considered significantly different. a case of influenza A was defined as illness in a person with positive RT-PCR results for that virus. a primary case was defined as illness in the first person in a cabin to report ILI symptoms. symptomatic passengers from cruise A were referred to nearby hospitals for testing. crew members and passengers on cruise B were asked to immediately report fever or respiratory symptoms to medical staff. the names of influenza case-patients reported after completion of cruise A were checked against the ship\u2019s manifest. activities were provided in 3 daily sessions (9:00 am\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u201310:00 pm) in 3 areas of the ship for 3 age groups: 3\u20136, 7\u201312, and >13 years of age. most childcare activities for this group took place in 1 room. the epidemiologic investigation focused on this group. results A total of 1,970 passengers and 734 crew members were on cruise A. median age of passengers was 46 years (range 1\u201394 years), 57% were female. most were born overseas (not in Australia) the attack rate for pandemic influenza was highest for children 3\u20136 years of age, followed by children 7\u201312 years of age. for seasonal influenza, the attack rate was similar among children in all age groups. two co-infected case-patients have been counted in both influenza categories. symptoms and Severity of Illness In total, 2 (3%) patients with pandemic influenza and 8 (8%) patients with seasonal influenza were hospitalized (p = 0.16); none died. the pandemic influenza outbreak began in the childcare center on may 18, which was 2 days after embarkation, and peaked on May 25. the first reported seasonal influenza case was in an adult whose symptoms began on may 17. the number of seasonal influenza cases peaked on may 25. the number of seasonal influenza cases also peaked on may 25. the number of seasonal influenza cases peaked on may 25. of the 45 children who attended childcare, 44 attended concurrently with an infectious pandemic influenza case-patient. 43 attended concurrently with an infectious seasonal influenza case-patient. the risk for pandemic influenza infection was significantly higher than was the risk for seasonal influenza. patients with pandemic and seasonal influenza were isolated in 149 discrete (family or household-like) groups. of the 45 quarantined passengers interviewed, 52% were initially informed of the need for quarantine through media reports, 25% by work or school colleagues, 11% from the ship\u2019s staff, and 5% from public health staff. clinical data Pandemic (H1N1) 2009, no.
