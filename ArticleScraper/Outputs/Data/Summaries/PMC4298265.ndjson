{"summary": "piglets from a 500 sow farrow-to-finish herd in southwestern Ontario experienced diarrhea, vomiting, and mortality over a 24-hour period. the herd had a past history of sporadic Escherichia coli diarrhea in piglets 5 d of age. the producer was instructed to submit live, acutely affected piglets to the AHL. piglets were transported together in a ventilated box and covered in watery feces. body condition appeared adequate for their age with signs of minimal dehydration. small and large intestine were distended with watery yellow translucent content. phenylethylalcohol plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 48 h. phenylethylalcohol plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 48 h. no E. coli F4 positive or Salmonella spp. were isolated from any of the samples tested. porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) real-time PCR assays were carried out in 25-L reactions in a light cycler 480 (Roche, Laval, Quebec) samples with crossing points lower than 37 were considered positive. TGEV-S \u2014 transmissible gastroenteritis spike protein gene; PCoV \u2014 porcine coronavirus; n/a \u2014 not available. the tests for PDCoV were negative. forward primer PEDN253 \u2014 5\u2032-GGCATTTCTACTACCTCGGA-3\u2032 and forward primer PEDS218 \u2014 5\u2032-GCTAGTGG CGTTCATGGTAT-3\u2032 and reverse primer PEDS442 \u2014 5\u2032-TAGGCAATTACGACCTGTTG were used to amplify 739 bp and 224 bp fragments. these were then sequenced directly, and gel-purified or cloned prior to sequencing four live piglets with acute diarrhea were submitted to the AHL. they ranged in age from 2 to 5 d, and in weight from 0.7 to 0.84 kg. piglets were transported together in a ventilated box. small intestine of a PED infected pig showed typical watery yellow intestinal content and congestion of serosal blood vessels. small intestinal samples from all piglets were submitted for E. coli F4, Salmonella spp. and Clostridium perfringens cultures. Clostridium perfringens was isolated from 1 piglet and 1 piglet. nucleic acid extraction and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) Colon samples were stab-swabbed and agitated in virus transport medium.
