{"summary": "stress granule formation is a pan-cellular mechanism employed to counter exposures to osmotic (Goulet et al., 2008; Dewey et al., 2011); oxidative (Kedersha et al., 1999; Stohr et al., 2006; McDonald et al., 2011); mitochondrial (Stoecklin et al., 2004; Chalupnikova et al., 2008); inhibition of RNA polymerase, exposure to inflammatory cytokines, nutrient depletion, and destabilization of microtubules do not induce SG formation in mammalian cells. stress granules were first defined as cytoplasmic foci containing polyadenylated RNA, small ribosomal sub-units, translation initiation factors, and RNA binding proteins (RBPs) PBs contain proteins involved in translational repression and mRNA degradation. they are present in basal conditions but can also be induced by some stress exposures. PB formation is dependent on available mRNA in the cytoplasm. the majority of the proteins described as localized to SGs belong to the large family of RBPs (60%). a similar proportion are implicated in RNA metabolism including transcription (12%), splicing (8%), RNA transport (7%), degradation (4%), silencing (2%), mRNA stabilization (3%), and translation (12%). TIA-1 (T-cell-restricted intracellular antigen-1) and G3BP1 (Ras GAP SH3 domain-binding protein 1) are the two most commonly studied and utilized SG markers. both feature a glycine-rich domain, also known as a prion-like, low complexity or intrinsically disordered domain. poliovirus infection, G3BP1 is cleaved by the viral protease 3C. infected cells exposed to heat shock have disrupted SG dynamics. SG size is diminished compared to non-infected heat-shocked cells. TIA-1 co-localizes with neuronal inclusions formed in response to expression of the first exon of the Huntingtin gene containing a polyglutamine expansion. in two different mouse models of Alzheimer\u2019s disease expressing Tau, three different cytoplasmic inclusions containing TIA-1, G3BP1 or TTP (Tristetraprolin, an RBP recruited to SGs) it has been proposed that the formation of these pathological inclusions may be due to misregulation of the SG response. there is no data nor methodology available to determine if these inclusions are broadly composed of SG proteins or if SG proteins are themselves recruited to pre-formed inclusions. the functional significance of these structures remains poorly defined. inclusions could be harmful due to inappropriate sequestration of critical cellular signaling proteins. inclusions could also be considered as neuroprotective due to sequestration of misfolded protein. a number of proteins linked to ALS are found in SGs and/or patient inclusions. this leads to the proposal that mutant disease proteins may interfere in the normal SG response during pathogenesis. the question remains very much open as to whether inclusions derive from SGs. TDP-43 and FUS share many structural similarities (Figure 3). they are involved in various aspects of mRNA metabolism including splicing, nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, transcription, mRNA stability, and SG dynamics. in ALS, exposure to external stress is frequently proposed as a contributor to either disease initiation or rate of progression. FUS and TDP-43 have structural similarities with both harboring a Prion-like domain, RNA recognition motif(s), nuclear localization signal, and nuclear export signal. details regarding the position of domains were derived from UniProt. stress granules contain translation initiation factors eIF3, eIF4, eIF5 and small ribosomal subunits. TIA-1 and G3BP1 feature a glycine-rich domain. TIA-1 was the most frequently studied marker of SGs, but has now been surpassed by G3BP1 in the literature. it is implicated in mRNA degradation via its endoribonuclease activity induced by its phosphorylation at Ser149. infected cells exposed to heat shock disrupt SG dynamics. a second model was created that generates viable pups. it shows that G3BP1 is critical for synaptic plasticity and calcium homeostasis. a close homolog of G3BP1 is also recruited to SGs. further studies are needed to define the role of G3BP2 in SGs. TIA-1 and TTP colocalize with phosphorylated Tau inclusions in murine models. cytoplasmic inclusions label for SG markers such as TIA-1, eIF3 and PABP. the formation of these pathological inclusions may be due to misregulation of the SG response. ALS-TDP Spinal cord Colombrita et al., 2009 TDP-43 TIA-1 Sporadic ALS Volkening et al., 2009 XRN1, not frequent FUS PABP1, eIF4G 1 Familial ALS-FUSR521C Spinal cord Dormann et al., 2010 7 Sporadic FTD-FUS Hippocampus TDP-43 PABP1, eIF4G 2 Sporadic FTD-T inclusions could be harmful due to inappropriate sequestration of critical cellular signaling proteins. pathological process or mutations could induce protein misfolding. inclusions could also be considered as neuroprotective due to sequestration of misfolded protein. a number of proteins linked to ALS are found in SGs and/or patient inclusions. this leads to the proposal that mutant disease proteins may interfere in the normal SG response during pathogenesis. however, generally the focus is on TDP-43 and FUS. both proteins are involved in various aspects of mRNA metabolism. they have prion-like domains (Cushman et al., 2010; King et al., 2012; Li et al., 2013). a combination of a prion-like domain and a RRM has been used to predict genetic modifiers or causes of several neurodegenerative diseases. localization of TDP-43 to SGs is mediated by both its RRM1 domain as well as its C-terminal glycine-rich/prion-like domain. the binding of TDP-43 to mRNA via its RRM1 as well as proteins, via the C-terminus, is relevant to its SG localization. wey et al., 2011 Cortical glia BE-M17 HEK293 0.5 mM SA, 1 h TIA-1, TIAR, PABP, eIF3 Overexpression Liu-Yesucevitz et al., 2010 Hanks balanced salt solution NSC34 0.5 mM SA, 30 min TIA-1, HuR Overexpression + Endogenous Colombrita et al., 2009 Heat shock, 44\u00b0 mutant s localized to SGs will further recruit wild type FUS protein. mutant s is independent of its glycine-rich/prion-like domain but does require its capacity to bind mRNA. mutant s localized to SGs will further recruit wild type FUS protein. et al., 2013 The Role of endogenous TDP-43 and FUS in stress Granule Dynamics. many teams have analyzed the effect of mutant or wild type proteins on SG phenotypes using overexpression in a range of transformed cells. SGs form initially as multiple small cytoplasmic puncta, which gradually coalesce into larger and less numerous structures. this process, sometimes called secondary aggregation, is completely abolished when TDP-43 levels are reduced. reintroduction of G3BP1 in depleted cells fully rescues SG secondary aggregation and function, G3BP1. expression of ALS-linked mutations in TDP-43 is reported to increase number of SGs per cell and the size of individual SGs compared to cells transfected with TDP-43WT. stress exposure exacerbates cell death uniquely in cells overexpressing mutant forms of TDP-43. mutant FUS expression increases the number of cells forming SGs in response to oxidative stress. mutant FUS expression increases the number of cells forming SGs in response to oxidative stress. microtubule destabilization leads to defective secondary aggregation of SGs. also increased PB formation in cells depleted of TDP-43 or G3BP1. however, depletion of endogenous TDP-43 or G3BP1 is not reported to be associated with obvious alterations in the microtubule network. e-directed SG dynamics, TDP-43 regulates both G3BP1 and HDAC6, which together are reported to bridge the interaction between SGs and motor proteins. the involvement of FUS in cellular movement is less studied compared to TDP-43. dewey et al., 2011; baron et al., 2013; Walker et al., 2013; Walker et al., 2013) there are only a handful that have examined the role of the endogenous proteins in SG dynamics. decreasing expression of either TDP-43 or FUS does not abolish SG formation. s et al., 2012, uncovered that SG coalescence favors interactions with PBs. this interaction seems essential to the protection of polyadenylated mRNA during oxidative stress. reintroduction of G3BP1 in TDP-43 depleted cells fully rescues SG secondary aggregation and function. the role for FUS in SG disassembly is unknown. mutations in ALS-linked mutations in TDP-43 and FUS have very divergent endogenous roles in the regulation of SG dynamics. mutant FUS expression increases the number of cells forming SGs in response to oxidative stress. SG assembly is delayed and disassembly is accelerated. mutant FUS expression increases the number of cells forming SGs. phenotypes are observed in cells depleted of TDP-43 or G3BP1. depletion of endogenous TDP-43 or G3BP1 is not reported to be associated with obvious alterations in the microtubule network. the role of FUS in actin-based transport has been confirmed. actin-based transport is reported as not involved in SG movement. the role of FUS in actin-based transport has been confirmed. tmann et al., 2012, reported the generation of \u201cstable\u201d TDP-43 positive inclusions that are distinct from SGs in cultured cells. the experimental conditions are quite different from those generally used to examine TDP-43 in SGs. this model recapitulates the main features observed in ALS/FTD tissues. despite these shortcomings, the functional significance of these inclusions on cell survival/vulnerability remains unknown. despite these shortcomings, this paraquat model is intriguing because it mimics ALS/FTD pathology. however, even though the impact on assembly is well described, SG disassembly is typically ignored. mutant TDP-43 loss of function induces the down-regulation of the major SG regulator G3BP1 (McDonald et al., 2011) this is linked to increased susceptibility of neuronal-like cells to oxidative stress. more in-depth studies examining the impact of mutant TDP-43 on SG kinetics. larger SGs with more labile TIA-1 and G3BP1 protein compared to cells transfected with FUSWT. inefficient clearance of non-specific aggregates composed of non-functional proteins could yield these cytoplasmic accumulations or \u201cprimo-aggregates\u201d of undefined composition. elucidating whether these cytoplasmic inclusions are beneficial, toxic or irrelevant is of utmost importance. conflict of interest statement The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
