{"summary": "coronaviruses are positive-sense RNA viruses with large genomes ranging in size from 26 to 31 kb. a process of discontinuous transcription during negative strand synthesis leads to expression of the structural and accessory proteins as a nested set of subgenomic (sg) mRNAs. avian gammacoronavirus IBV causes disease in chickens of all ages. a reverse genetics system for IBV, utilizing vaccinia virus, has also been established. a number of studies have demonstrated the generation of infectious recombinant coronaviruses that are able to express heterologous genes. this is a key requirement of any vaccine vector [23]\u2013[27]. avian viruses such as the paramyxovirus Newcastle disease virus and the avipoxvirus fowlpox virus have previously been evaluated for use as vectors. rIBV possesses two accessory genes, Gene 3 and Gene 5 and the recently characterised IR. successfully rescued viruses were characterised and investigated for genetic stability. the replacement of Gene 5 with heterologous genes represents a promising target for the generation of IBV-based vaccine vectors. the chickens were sacrificed under a schedule 1 procedure, cervical neck dislocation, a procedure that does not fall under any UK home office licence requirements. the kidneys were removed from the sacrificed chickens for preparation of the primary CK cell cultures. three fragments were amplified with primer pairs: 24979M \u2013 25487IR (24979M: 5\u2032-TTTGGCGCGCCGCTAAGTGTGAACCAGACCACTTGCC-3\u2032 and 25487IR-eGFP: 5\u2032-GCTCCTCGCTCTCACCATCGTGTTAAGTTTTTG-3\u2032. eGFP or hRluc (eGFP-F: 5\u2032-CAAAAACTTAACAAATAATACGCGAT pGPTNEB193 was used to generate plasmids pGPT-eGFP5ab and pGPT-hRluc5ab. only synthetic sequence representing IBVhRluc could be cloned into pGPTNEB193 by Geneart\u00ae. 5.3 (1533) CGC 5.6 (1612) CUA 11.4 (3266) CCA 20.0 (5733) CAA 24.2 (6937) CGA 2.5 (708) CUG 7.2 (2057) CCG 18.8 (5381) CGG 1.5 (424) AUU 27.2 (7813) AGU 21.6 (6186) AUC 5.6 (1596) ACC 4.8 (1379) AAC 12.8 (3671) AGC 5.9 (1690) AUA 19.7 (5643) ACA underlined nucleotides are derived from reporter gene sequences. bold italics show inserted restriction sites NheI and XmaI. sequences were cloned into NheI/XmaI digested pGPTIR.

RNA was transferred to brightStar\u00ae-Plus positively charged nylon membrane (Ambion) using capillary action for 2 h, cross-linked by treatment with UV light using the auto-crosslink function on a Stratalinker UV Crosslinker (Stratagene) and prehybridised overnight at 42\u00b0C. we first designed a series of rIBVs that could be used to assess the ability of IBV to express heterologous proteins and determine the stability of each rIBV. the growth characteristics of the rIBVs were compared to the control viruses BeauR5ab, BeauR3ab and BeauRIR [42] in which the regions being replaced were deleted. IBVeGFP and IBVhRluc were the same as the normal reporter genes. rIBVs were expressed using the existing Gene 3 TRS. a stretch of 20 nucleotides was maintained to avoid disruption of ORF 3c. a copy of the consensus IBV TRS with flanking nucleotides derived from the Gene 5 TRS (5\u2032-GUUUUAUAACAAAUACGGACG-3\u2032) was based on our knowledge of the expression of foreign genes from IBV D-RNAs [12], [14]. inclusion of six 5\u2032-flanking, and nine 3\u2032-flanking nucleotides was based on an extension of previous findings demonstrating that the four nucleotides new eGFP and hRluc nucleotide sequences, IBVeGFP and IBVhRluc, were generated and synthesised with 34 and 29% of nucleotides changed, respectively. the final two rIBVs, BeauR-IBVeGFP5ab and BeauR-IBVhRluc5ab, were subsequently designed in which Gene 5 was replaced with the synthesised codon-optimised reporter genes. rIBVs BeauR-eGFP5ab, BeauR-hRluc5ab and BeauR-IBVhRluc5ab were replaced with reporter genes eGFP, hRluc or IBVhRluc. each rIBV was subsequently passaged to P4 on CK cells for further analysis. northern blot analysis of purified mRNA extracted from CK cells infected with 1105 pfu wild type, parental virus, Beau-R. mRNA was not quantified prior to loading on gel and is shown only to demonstrate that sg mRNAs were generated as expected. RNAs were hybridised with a DNA probe specific to the IBV 3\u2032 UTR. peak titres for all rIBVs lacking the Gene 5 proteins were approximately 1-log10 lower, at 1106 pfu/ml, than wild type Beau-R. a 2-log10 increase was noted for Beau-R compared to a0.5-log10 increase at 8 hpi for all rIBVs suggesting a delay in replication or release of the rIBVs lacking Gene 5. the luciferase activity of BeauR-IBVhRluc5ab R1 reached approximately 2-log10 lower peak levels at 24 hpi. the mutation led to a frameshift and alteration of the hRluc amino acid sequence downstream of amino acid 262. analysis of BeauR-IBVhRluc5ab R2 showed luciferase activity levels more closely mirroring those of BeauR-hRluc5ab. the amino acid sequence of the mutated hRluc gene (hRluc*) identified in the R1 of BeauR-IBVhRluc5ab is shown aligned to the hRluc gene sequence. the modified region in hRluc* sequence is underlined. the IR contains deletions rendering the sequence more likely a non-coding region. Plaques produced from BeauR-eGFPIR were 1.5 mm smaller in diameter than those observed from BeauR-hRlucIR. both Beau-R and BeauRIR had similar replication kinetics, showing maximum peak titres of 5107 pfu/ml at 24 hpi and supporting the plaque assay data. mRNA was extracted from CK cells infected with 1105 pfu wild type, parental virus, Beau-R (WT) and replicates R1 and R2 of P4 BeauR-eGFPIR or BeauR-hRlucIR. mRNAs were hybridised with a DNA probe specific to the IBV 3\u2032 UTR. a double mutation of 25770UA and 25771UA led to the introduction of a premature termination codon within ORF 5b. a similar mutation has been previously identified in rIBVs with a Beau-R background [45] however, this particular mutation is not associated with the presence of heterologous genes. sg mRNAs expressing the reporter genes EGFP and hRluc from rIBVs BeauR-eGFPIR and BeauR-hRlucIR were aligned with the reporter gene sequences in the rIBV genomes to identify the origin of the leader-body junctions. the sg mRNAs originate from the natural IR TRS and not from the inserted copy of the canonical IBV TRS. Renilla luciferase activity from BeauR-hRlucIR was also lower. peak activity from BeauR-hRluc5ab was approximately 2-log10 lower. it is possible that these reduced protein expression levels may also be a result of reduced translation due to the presence of the wild type IR AUG upstream of the reporter gene AUG. this was confirmed by sequence analysis which identified sequence variation in a region initiating approximately 40 nts from the 3\u2032 end of the hRluc gene in R2 and extending into the inserted TRS required for the transcription of a sg mRNA for the E protein. also, a 3 nt deletion was also observed within the inserted canonical, CUUAACAA, TRS for the E protein in R1 of BeauR-hRluc3ab, resulting purified mRNA was not quantified prior to loading on gel. RNAs were hybridised with a DNA probe specific to the IBV 3\u2032 UTR. the new sg mRNA (labelled E), synthesised from the inserted TRS for expression of the E protein, is indicated with an open arrowhead. analysis of IBV RNA from CK cells infected with BeauR-hRluc3ab R1 identified a low abundant sg mRNA, at the expected position above the M gene sg mRNA. the low abundance of this new sg mRNA could result from an effect of the observed deletion in the introduced TRS. synthesis of a new mRNA species may not be as efficient as that for normal viral sg mRNA transcription. the genetic stability of each rIBV was initially assessed by blind passage of the rIBVs on CK cells and characterisation by RT-PCR analysis to determine the presence, or absence of the heterologous gene. rIBVs in embryonated hens' eggs revealed the same pattern of genetic instability for each virus. replicates R1 and R2 of BeauR-eGFP5ab, BeauR-eGFPIR, BeauR-hRluc5ab, BeauR-IBVhRluc5ab, BeauR-hRlucIR and BeauR-hRluc3ab were blind passaged on CK cells from P4 to P12. regions flanking the reporter gene sites of rIBVs following passage to P8 on CK cells were amplified by RT-PCR. non-wild type PCR products were cloned and sequenced. Schematics representing deletions are shown for wild type (A) BeauR-eGFPIR and (B) BeauR-hRluc5ab. expression of hRluc, and IBVhRluc, was stable for at least 12 passages in cell culture following replacement of Gene 5. expression of hRluc, and IBVhRluc, was stable for at least 4 passages compared to passage at a higher MOI. genetic instability was observed for BeauR-hRlucIR and BeauR-hRluc3ab as indicated by the appearance of smaller PCR products. size markers (L) in base pairs are indicated to the left. design of recombinant IBVs. expression of eGFP or hRluc from BeauR-eGFP5ab and BeauR-hRluc5ab was achieved via the existing Beaudette Gene 5 TRS. schematic diagrams of the rIBVs containing codon optimised versions were the same as the normal reporter genes. the introduced reporter genes were expressed using the existing Gene 3 TRS. to ensure expression of the E protein the insertion of an artificial TRS was required downstream of the reporter gene sequence for the transcription of an additional sg mRNA for translation of eGFP or hRluc. new eGFP and hRluc nucleotide sequences, IBVeGFP and IBVhRluc, were generated and synthesised with 34 and 29% of nucleotides changed, respectively. the final two rIBVs, BeauR-IBVeGFP5ab and BeauR-IBVhRluc5ab, were subsequently designed in which Gene 5 was replaced with the synthesised codon-optimised reporter gene sequences rIBVs expressing eGFP or hRluc were replaced with reporter genes eGFP, hRluc or IBVhRluc. a potential rIBV, BeauR-IBVeGFP5ab containing the codon-optimised eGFP gene, was not possible. the successful rescue of infectious rIBVs was confirmed by formation of plaques on CK cells. extracellular virus was harvested at various times post infection. progeny virus titres determined by plaque assay. Error bars represent standard deviation (SD) of results from three experiments assayed. effects of deleting IBV Gene 5 and subsequent insertion of the reporter genes in place of Gene 5 were compared to wild type Beau-R and control virus BeauR5ab. similar replication kinetics were observed for all three rIBVs and for control virus BeauR5ab. peak titres at 24 hpi for all the rIBVs lacking the Gene 5 proteins were approximately 1-log10 lower, at 1106 pfu/ml, than wild type Beau-R luciferase activity was measured in CK cells infected with P4 of rIBV BeauR-eGFP5ab. luciferase activity was measured in CK lysates during time course assays. luciferase activity was found to correlate with levels of virus titre during infection. hRluc expression, as relative light units, was detected in CK cells infected with R1 of BeauR-hRluc5ab, BeauR-hRlucIR, BeauR-hRluc3ab and with R1 and R2 of BeauR-IBVhRluc5ab. the amino acid sequence of the mutated hRluc gene (hRluc*) identified in R1 of BeauR-IBVhRluc5ab is shown aligned plaques produced from BeauR-eGFPIR were 1.5 mm smaller in diameter. plaque size differences were observed depending on whether the IR sequence was replaced by eGFP or hRluc. both rIBVs had similar replication kinetics. extracellular virus was harvested at various times post infection. progeny virus titres determined by plaque assay. Error bars represent SD of results from three experiments assayed in triplicate. rIBVs BeauR-eGFPIR and BeauR-hRlucIR were included as a negative control. the replication kinetics of rIBV BeauR-eGFPIR R2 were also investigated. this indicated that the replication differences observed between BeauR-eGFPIR and BeauR-hRlucIR resulted from the insertion of different reporter genes. non-canonically transcribed sg mRNA recently confirmed for the IR [42] was increased in size as would be predicted for the presence of the reporter gene sequences. sg mRNAs expressing the reporter genes EGFP and hRluc were aligned with the reporter gene sequences in the rIBV genomes to identify the origin of the leader-body junctions. eGFP or hRluc was not affected by the unexpected observation that the proteins were produced from an existing sg mRNA, rather than from a new sg mRNA generated from an additionally inserted TRS. however, because of the naturally low levels of the IR sg mRNA due to transcription from a non-canonical TRS, we consequently observed lower levels of fluorescence from BeauR-eGFPIR than from BeauR-eGFP5a plaques were observed between replicates of the 5ab and IR recombinants. this was not the case for BeauR-hRluc3ab, where a mixture of plaque sizes was visible for R2. this was confirmed by sequence analysis which identified sequence variation in a region initiating approximately 40 nts from the 3\u2032 end of the hRluc gene in R2 and extending into the inserted TRS required for the transcription of a sg mRNA for the extracellular virus was harvested at various times post infection. the progeny virus titres determined by plaque assay. Error bars represent SD of results from three experiments assayed in triplicate. gene expression was confirmed by northern blot analysis. size of the hRluc sg mRNA of R2 appeared smaller than that of R1. the issues identified above may be due to deletions within the hRluc gene. characterisation of R1 and R2 of BeauR-hRluc3ab demonstrated rescue of rIBVs may result in differences arising between replicates of the same virus. genetic stability of each rIBV was initially assessed by blind passage of the rIBVs on CK cells and characterisation by RT-PCR analysis to determine the presence or absence of the heterologous gene. replicates R1 and R2 of BeauR-eGFP5ab, BeauR-eGFPIR, BeauR-hRluc5ab, BeauR-IBVhRluc5ab, BeauR-hRluc5ab, BeauR-hRlucIR and BeauR-hRluc3ab were blind passaged on CK cells from P4 to P12. ion of instabilitya R1 R2 BeauR-eGFP5ab P9 P8 BeauR-eGFPIR P7 P7 BeauR-hRluc5ab P8 P8 BeauR-hRlucIR P8 P8 BeauR-hRluc3ab P5 P7 a Final passage number achieved including rescue passages, P0\u2013P4 Figure 10 Schematic representation of rIBV genetic instability. RT-PCR analysis indicated large-scale deletions did not arise until P7. smaller PCR products representing possible deletions were observed as early as P5 for BeauR-hRluc3ab R1, which may have resulted from the 3 nt deletion observed at P4 within the inserted TRS for expression of the E gene. replicates R1 of BeauR-hRluc5ab, BeauR-IBVhRluc5ab, BeauR-hRlucIR and BeauR-hRluc3ab were passaged on CK cells from P4 to P12 at an MOI of 0.01. Extracellular virus was harvested 24 hpi and RNA analysed by RT-PCR. genetic instability was observed for BeauR-hRlucIR and BeauR-hRluc3ab as indicated by the the replacement of accessory genes with heterologous genes has been successfully demonstrated for a number of coronaviruses in recent years, including IBV. the replacement of accessory genes with heterologous genes has been successfully demonstrated for a number of coronaviruses. youn et al. obtained a rIBV, genetically stable up to P15, by replacing ORFs 3a and 3b with firefly luciferase. insertion of heterologous sequences resulted in viruses arising rapidly with deletions within the hRluc gene. despite deletions arising rapidly in the population from P5 onwards, we observed the expression of hRluc up to P11 in initial experiments and up to at least P12 when passaged at an MOI of 0.01. this was in contrast to the replacement of Gene 5 or the IR, where once deletions were detected loss of the heterologous gene from the virus population was complete following 1\u20133 further passages. this was in contrast to the replacement of Gene 5 or the IR, where once deletion in both cases there was limited complementarity between the artificially inserted consensus TRS and the leader sequence of the virus beyond the CUUAACAA sequence. it is possible that increasing this complementarity would lead to more stable gene expression or, in case of the IR, the switch in transcription occurring at the artificial TRS and not the natural non-canonical IR TRS. codon-optimisation of genes has been shown to increase translational efficiency of heterologous genes in different cell types. expression of viral genes has also been shown to be increased by codon-optimisation [53], [54] or decreased by codon-deoptimisation [55], and this may be important for expression of heterologous genes from vaccine vectors. a complete investigation of the translation efficiency of a codon optimised gene would be required if such a modification were pursued for vaccine development. the stability of these rIBVs varied depending on genome location of the heterologous gene and/or the level of modification to the IBV genome required for expression of the gene. the replacement of Gene 5 proved to be the most successful in terms of stability while the replacement of ORFs 3a and 3b was found to be the least stable. cellular tropism of the virus and the potential for using IBV as a broader vector for use in non-avian animals and humans."}
