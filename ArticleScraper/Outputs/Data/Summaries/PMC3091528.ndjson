{"summary": "LSECtin is one of a group of glycan-binding receptors encoded near the end of human chromosome 19. other receptors in the cluster include dendritic and endothelial cell receptors dendritic cell-intercellular adhesion molecule 1 grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) and the structurally related Fc-binding receptor CD23 (Soilleux et al. 2000) rin-mediated endocytosis can undergo antibody-induced internalization in myeloid cells. human LSECtin can provide a route for Ebola virus and SARS coronavirus infection of cells initiated by binding of LSECtin to glycans of the viral envelope glycoproteins. knockout mice lacking LSECtin show increased sensitivity to liver damage mediated by T cells following acute injury. biochemical characterization of mouse LSECtin is presented. it is demonstrated that the simple disaccharide GlcNAc1-2Man acts as an effective inhibitor of binding to the viral glycoprotein. expression was detected exclusively in the liver, as was previously observed for human LSECtin in a survey of a similar set of human tissues. the resulting 1050 bp DNA fragment was resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis. the protein was eluted from the column with EDTA-containing elution buffer. the protein was inserted immediately after the bacterial ompA signal sequence. the signal sequence allows folding of the CRD in the periplasm. resulting protein was purified by affinity chromatography as for untagged protein. tetrameric protein retained on 1-mL affinity column, whereas uncomplexed CRD washes through. bound CRD\u2013streptavidin complex was then eluted from affinity column. only two glycans that contain terminal GlcNAc1-2Man yield poor signals on the array. the specificity of mouse LSECtin for the GlcNAc1-2Man group was further demonstrated in competition binding assays. the affinity for the disaccharide was 1000-fold higher than for any of the monosaccharides tested. methyl mannoside 2.0 0.7 -Methyl galactoside >500 GlcNAc1-2Man 0.0102 0.0008 CRD immobilized on polystyrene wells was probed with 125I-mannose-BSA in presence of competing sugars. initial characterization of mouse LSECtin binding to glycan ligands suggested its ligand-binding specificity is closely analogous to that of the human protein. a virus glycoprotein confirmed that the absence of the tryptophan side chain does not significantly affect the interaction. the absence of the tryptophan side chain does not significantly affect the interaction. the effects of changing Trp259 to arginine, as in the mouse CRD, on binding of Ebola glycoprotein-Fc fusion protein to the immobilized CRD. Saturation binding curves were obtained in parallel assays. the simple GlcNAc1-2Man disaccharide competes at micromolar concentrations for binding of neoglycoprotein ligands to mouse LSECtin. results demonstrate that the KI of the disaccharide is in the low micromolar range for both human and mouse receptors. expression and characterization of the CRD from mouse LSECtin LSECtin is a type 2 transmembrane protein in which the C-type CRD resides at the C-terminal end of the protein. an initial survey of the distribution of LSECtin expression was undertaken using the polymerase chain reaction. the cDNA encoding the CRD is inserted immediately after the bacterial ompA signal sequence. the signal sequence allows folding of the CRD in the periplasm. however, for the mouse CRD, more efficient expression was obtained by production of the CRD as inclusion bodies that were dissolved in guanidine hydrochloride and renatured by dilution and dialysis. tetrameric protein is efficiently retained on a 1-mL affinity column, whereas uncomplexed CRD washes through. the bound CRD\u2013streptavidin complex was then eluted from the affinity column with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) 1-2Man disaccharide was immobilized on polystyrene wells and probed with 125I-mannose-BSA. affinity for the disaccharide was 1000-fold higher than for any of the monosaccharides tested. testing of the pH sensitivity of ligand binding indicated that the binding activity of mouse LSECtin is enhanced at low pH. the combined results thus suggest close similarity in the mechanism of ligand binding to human and mouse LSECtin. the observed high degree of similarity between the human and mouse proteins was not necessarily predicted based on sequence comparison. position 259 in the human protein has been suggested to contribute to high affinity binding of the GlcNAc1\u20132Man epitope. similarity in binding specificities of human and mouse LSECtin suggested that, like the human protein, mouse LSECtin might be a target for binding to the surface glycoprotein of Ebola virus. the disaccharide was tested for its ability to compete for binding of both receptors to the Ebola virus glycoprotein. results demonstrate that the KI of the disaccharide is in the low micromolar range for both human and mouse receptors. this result provides an important lead toward the development of high-affinity inhibitors of Ebola virus binding to sinusoidal endothelial cells. tin is consistent with the fact that DC-SIGN functions as an endocytic receptor able to a direct pathogen uptake and presentation to the immune system. the binding of endogenous ligands, such as CD44 on T cells, would be the primary function of LSECtin, which has been hijacked by certain pathogens like Ebola virus. mice in which LSECtin has been knocked out are shown to have a physiological role in the human receptor. cDNA was isolated by polymerase chain reaction amplification from a mouse liver cDNA library from BD Biosciences (Oxford, UK) synthetic oligonucleotides were combined with restriction fragments from the cDNA to insert the region encoding the CRD into vector T5T. codons for an initiator methionine
