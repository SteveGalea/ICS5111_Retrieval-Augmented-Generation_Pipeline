{"summary": "the most common route of infection is cutaneous, although infection via the respiratory route is highly efficient and can cause a lethal infection in 30\u201360% of patients that do not receive treatment. in mice, respiratory infection with a single virulent organism is virtually always lethal while in a human as few as 50 organisms are believed to result in a potentially lethal infection. the alveolus is composed of two other cell types: alveolar epithelial type I (AT-I) and alveolar epithelial type II cells (AT-I), which are important components of a physical barrier to protect deeper tissues from microbes and airborne particles. the bacteria must interact with other cell types in order to breach the respiratory epithelium and gain access to deeper tissue and the bloodstream. bacterial counts increased rapidly in the lungs, suggesting that the organisms were multiplying within type II airway epithelial cells. a study by Hall et al. examined the types and percentages of murine lung cells infected after inhalation of F. tularensis. strains were grown in modified Mueller-Hinton broth with aeration at 37\u00b0C. antibiotics kanamycin and/or spectinomycin were added to the growth media at a concentration of 25 g per ml when necessary. at 4, 16 or 24 hours post-infection the cells were seeded onto collagen-coated coverslips in 24 well dishes and infected according to the protocol described above. at 4, 16 or 24 hours post-infection the cells on the coverslips were fixed with 10% formalin for 30 minutes, permeabilized with acetone/methanol (1:1) for 15 minutes. after 4 hours, cells were washed three times with PBS before adding fresh tissue culture media containing 50 g per m immunoostaining was performed using mouse anti-GFP monoclonal antibody diluted 1:10,000 (Sigma) secondary antibodies were acquired from the University of Iowa Central Microscopy and used at a dilution of 1:500. samples were viewed and images were captured with a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope. Lungs were removed by dissection from each mouse and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 2 days. the other lung samples were placed into 2.5% gluteraldehyde. samples were then washed for 15 minutes in a series of increasing ethanol concentrations starting with 50% ethanol, 75% ethanol, 95% ethanol. strains were grown in modified Mueller-Hinton broth with aeration at 37\u00b0C. antibiotics kanamycin and/or spectinomycin were added to the growth media at a concentration of 25 g per ml when necessary. epithelial cell growth assays Approximately 3 x 105 cells were infected. AT-II cells were seeded onto collagen-coated coverslips in 24 well dishes. at 4, 16 or 24 hours post-infection the cells on the coverslips were fixed with 10% formalin for 30 minutes, permeabilized with acetone/methanol (1:1) for 15 minutes, washed with PBS and stored in blocking buffer until immunostaining was performed. each mouse was anesthetized by inhalation of isoflurane and then infected intranasally with F. tularensis SchuS4, F. tularensis SchuS4 waaY::TrgTn or F. tularensis LVS in a volume of 50 l. each mouse was anesthetized by inhalation of isoflurane and then immediately infected intranasally with samples were washed 3 times in 0.2M sodium cacodylate buffer and then fixed in a 1% osmium, 1.5% potassium ferrocyanide solution for 1 hour. samples were then washed for 15 minutes in a series of increasing ethanol concentrations starting with 50% ethanol, 75% ethanol, 95% ethanol, and ending with 100% ethanol. the interactions of virulent F. tularensis Schu S4 and the F. tularensis LVS strains in human AT-II cells remain unknown. we characterized the O-antigen mutant Schu S4 waaY::TrgTn (FTT_1236), which has been reported to have 10-fold higher uptake and growth kinetics in human MDM cells. bacterial burden in cells infected with Schu S4 compared to cells infected with Schu S4 waaY::TrgTn or LVS (P 0.05 and P 0.01, respectively) we saw no apparent sign of cell death by cells infected with Schu S4 at 24 hours. the cells that were infected contained 2,500\u20135,000 cfu. as a control, Miller assays were performed which demonstrated that overexpression of FevR from this plasmid increases an iglA-lacZ reporter (4-fold) however, even when fevR gene expression was substantially increased in LVS the AT-II cell growth defect was not rescued. nutrient availability (i.e. amino acids) is important for Francisella cytosolic cell growth. a similar set of experiments examined the interactions of the bacteria with these cells using confocal microscopy. however, by 24 hours there were several notable differences between the three strains that correlated well with the bacterial count data shown in Fig 1. ularensis Schu S4 replicates robustly in human AT-II cells. F. tularensis waaY::TrgTn has a low capacity to grow in the cytosol of these cells. the mechanism for why this mutation results in this cell growth phenotype is unknown and is under active investigation. infected cells were classified into three separate categories based on the amount of bacteria each cell contained at 24 hpi. mice were euthanized and the lungs were perfused and processed for TEM imaging. a MOI of 100 bacteria per alveolus was used to increase the probability of detecting organisms within the lung tissues. at 16 or 24 hours post-infection, mice were euthanized. TEM images of infected mouse lungs at 24 hours post infection. infected cells were classified as dark stratified stained organelles. bacteria were identified by smooth dark staining that lacked stratification. multiple AT-II cells were observed that contained 1\u20133 bacteria from lungs infected with each of the three Francisella strains. there may be small differences in quantitative uptake of the different Francisella strains into the AT-II cells, but no differences could be determined using TEM. infected mice were sacrificed at 32 or 48 hpi and lungs were harvested. the majority of the cells containing internalized Francisella were AT-II cells. however, several infected AT-II cells had visible changes suggesting the cells were dying. at 16 and 24 hours post-infection, lungs infected with either PBS, Schu S4 or LVS were clear of debris within the airspace observed. by 24 hours post-infection, a substantial portion of the airspace was observed to contain this cellular debris. averages were calculated from analysis of greater than 50 scored airspaces from 2 separate lung sections per strain and time point. individual alveolar airspaces, defined by the border of the alveolar epithelium, were evaluated for the percent of the airspace containing cellular debris. in the PBS control mice, there was little to no cellular debris observed at 16 or 24 hours post-infection. wild type Schu S4 only had 3% of all scored airspaces that contained over half of the airspace filled. no airspace was observed in Schu S4 infected lungs to have greater than three-fourth of the airspace filled with cellular debris. ensis strain Schu S4 waaY::TrgTn (FTT_1236) has been reported to have 10-fold higher uptake and growth kinetics in human MDM cells. the organism grows robustly within human MDMs until 16 hours post-infection when the organisms cease growing. growth of F. tularensis Schu S4 and F. tularensis waaY::TrgTn was measured. the ability of the three Francisella strains to enter and replicate with these epithelial lung cells was measured after infecting at an MOI 100:1. the growth pattern of the Schu S4 waaY::TrgTn strain in the human AT-II cells paralleled its growth pattern in human MDMs. a significant impact on the growth of the strain was observed (90-fold growth over 24 hours) cell cytosol infected with F. tularensis Schu S4 clearly allowed vigorous replication as observed by the filling of cell cytosol with GFP-labeled F. tularensis. the majority of LVS-infected cells at 24 hours post infection still contained only a single bacterium, suggesting that LVS was significantly impaired in its ability to replicate within the human AT-II cells. infected cells were placed into one of three groups: 5 or less intracellular bacteria, between 6\u201335 intracellular bacteria, and greater than 35 intracellular bacteria. more than 300 cells for each strain were counted from three separate experiments. 80% of infected cells had robust growth with more than 35 bacteria. mice were infected intranasally with F. tularensis Schu S4, Schu S4 waaY::TrgTn, LVS or PBS (negative control), and mice immunized with Schu S4 waaY::TrgTn demonstrated some protection against a wild type Schu S4 challenge. the cause of death is different between Schu S4 and the waaY mutant. at 16 or 24 hours post-infection, mice were euthanized and the lungs were perfused and processed for TEM imaging. a MOI of 100 bacteria per alveolus was used to increase the probability of detecting organisms within the lung tissues. panel A\u2014Cell containing a F. tularensis organism magnified 8,000-fold. white rectangle marks area of interest shown in panels B and C. bacterium and membrane surrounding the organism are shown. TEM images of infected mice intranasally with either F. tularensis Schu S4 (A-F), F. tularensis Schu S4 waaY::TrgTn (G-K), and F. tularensis LVS (I,L) each image shows an AT-II cell containing organisms. the area containing the internalized bacteria is within the white rectangle. the majority of the cells containing internalized Francisella were AT-II cells. however, unlike cells with intracellular F. tularensis at 16 and 24 hpi, several infected AT-II cells had visible changes suggesting that the cells were dying. these dying cells were observed in all strains tested and no significant differences were observed. at 16 and 24 hours post-infection, lungs infected with either PBS, Schu S4 or LVS were clear of debris within the airspace observed. however, mice infected with Schu S4 waaY::TrgTn had significant pathology in the alveoli. in the control mice, there was little to no cellular debris observed at 16 or 24 hours post-infection for F. tularensis Schu S4 or F. tularensis LVS. at 24 hours post-infection, both Schu S4 and LVS had some observable cellular debris that increased the average airspace damage score from 1 to 1.3. tularensis is a Tier 1 Select Agent pathogen capable of causing lethal human respiratory infection with a very low inoculum. organisms in the airway must breach the epithelium and pass through the endothelium to enter the bloodstream. the mechanisms by which Francisella passes through the respiratory epithelia are still poorly understood. type II pneumocytes, or AT-II cells, are an integral part of the alveolar epithelium. these cells have a variety of biological functions including production of surfactant that is important for biophysical stabilization of the alveolus [41], maintenance of alveolar fluid balance [42], differentiation into AT-I cells which are important for structural integrity of the alveolus [43], and involvement with activating components of both innate and adaptive immunity [17]. the results demonstrate no discernible growth differences between F. tularensis Schu S4 and F. tularensis LVS in both human macrophages and A549 cells. others demonstrated that LVS grows well in A549 cells [48, 50], but did not compare the growth of LVS to a virulent F. tularensis strain. virulence strain F. tularensis LVS has an attenuated virulence phenotype in the human AT-II cells. the strain also has an attenuated virulence phenotype in the human AT-II cells. this may provide the opportunity to engineer a better vaccine strain. alveolar macrophages that had engulfed organisms may have been washed out of the mouse lungs by perfusion. it is not a trivial exercise to identify intracellular Francisella organisms within the AT-II cells of the alveoli by TEM. the TEM images highlight the path that organisms within the AT-II cells likely follow to cause systemic disease. as organisms pass through or escape from an AT-II cell they will have access to the bloodstream via passage through the endothelium of the immediately available alveolar capillary. this mutant strain induced significant levels of pathology in the mouse lungs. the lack of debris in the airspaces adds to the evidence that virulent wild type Francisella strains establish infection of a host using a host. TEM data and in vitro cell infection data have allowed us to develop model of how F. tularensis establishes lung infection. inhaled organisms are carried to the small alveolar sacs and interact with the cell populations present in the alveoli: alveolar macrophages and AT-II cells. study by Forestal et al. showed 75% of Schu S4 organisms in the bloodstream were extracellular. future experiments will help to clearly define the individual steps in the infection process."}
