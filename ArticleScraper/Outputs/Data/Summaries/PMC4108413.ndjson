{"summary": "the prevalence of neural tube defects (NTDs) is known to vary significantly based upon geography and ethnicity. the mothers of an NTD-affected child are 10-fold more likely to give birth to a second child with an NTD. there are multiple types of isolated NTDs including spina bifida and anencephaly. 27 out of 6,188 pregnancies (0.4%) without any increased NTD risk had AFAFP levels >2.5 MoM. two out of 258 pregnancies (0.8%) with an increased NTD risk had elevated AFAFP levels and were associated with affected pregnancies. 44 of 55 pregnancies with clinically diagnosed fetal NTDs had increased AFAFP levels. this technique has been successfully applied in the discovery of serum biomarkers for many cancers [5]\u2013[18], nervous system diseases [19]\u2013[22] and renal diseases [23]\u2013[32]. a classification tree using \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d algorithms to process SELDI data improves the accuracy to differentiate cancer patients from non-cancer groups [33]\u2013[34]. control amniotic fluid samples were collected from pregnant women with a normal fetal karyotype. prenatal diagnoses of NTD-affected and normal fetuses were confirmed using ultrasonography. protein chips (Ciphergen Biosystems, Inc., Fremont, CA, USA) for serum protein profiling were tested in this study. results showed that the weak cationic exchange ProteinChip, CM10, had a higher capture ability and signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) therefore, CM10 was selected for all subsequent experiments. each spot was washed with 200 l deionized water. then 0.5 l saturated sinnapinic acid was applied to each spot. chips were re-incubated with sinnapinic acid. classification tree was generated using BPS version 5.0. spectral data of the training set were further analyzed. the classification tree is cut down to a desired size. 113 maternal amniotic fluid samples were collected between gestational weeks 15.0 and 34.0. gestational age was determined from the date of the last menstrual period or by an ultrasonography examination when the LMP was uncertain. amniotic fluid samples were collected during an aseptic procedure through the abdominal wall and by direct ultrasound guidance. two ml of amniotic fluid were collected, immediately centrifuged at 2,500 rpm, 4\u00b0C for 5 min, distributed into 100 l aliquots and stored at 80\u00b0C until analyzed. 100 l prepared serum sample, or urine sample, or amniotic fluid sample, was added into each well. 200 l binding buffer was added into each well, shaking at 250 rpm for 5 min. 0.5 l saturated sinnapinic acid was applied to each spot and the chips were allowed to air dry. molecular masses from 0\u20131000 Da were excluded from analysis. peak intensities were normalized to total ionic current of peaks with m/z between 1000 and 30000 Da. sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were performed using the t-test. results Serum SELDI Profiles of NTDs versus Normal Controls Total of 55 qualified mass peaks were detected. mass(Da) P value NTDs (Mean SD) Ctrl (Mean SD) Fold 4105 0.000163 59.348.53 47.185.73 1.26 4297 0.000641 35.823.62 22.833.60 1.57 4188 0.00196 40.205.08 25.564.52 1.57 5497 0.00376 4.190.20 7.970.73 0.53 28078 0.00483 5.410.92 6.610.89 0. 10567 and 10567 Da were up-regulated, while 1 peak with m/z of 3458 Da was down-regulated in NTDs group compared to control group. the mass-to-change ratio (m/z) ranged between 8800\u20139400 Da. 23417 da was down-regulated in NTDs group compared to control group. the mass-to-change ratio (m/z) ranged between 12000\u201318000 Da. X-axis showed molecular weight of peaks and Y-axis showed intensity of peaks. protein peaks and 2 protein peaks at 4105 and 7788 Da were automatically selected as splitters. the left node included peaks with intensity 53.002 and the right node contained the remaining peaks with intensity >53.002. each branch node was further classified into next layer using the same method with 7788 Da as the cutoff. the algorithm correctly classified 86% (31 of 36) of the testing samples with a sensitivity of 89% (17 of 19), specificity of 94% (17 of 18), positive predictive value of 95% (18 of 19) and negative predictive value of 89% (17 of 19) our results yielded sensitivity of 95%, specificity of 89%, positive predictive value of 91% and negative predictive value of 94% (17 of 19) the algorithm correctly classified 89% (33 of 37) of the testing samples with a sensitivity of 90% (18 of 20), specificity of 88% (15 of 17), positive predictive value of 90% (18 of 20) and negative predictive value of 88% (15 of 17) the results yielded sensitivity of 93%, specificity of 89%, positive predictive value of 90% (18 of 20) and negative predictive value of 88% (15 of 17) z of serum, Urine and amniotic fluid SELDI profile Comparing among serum, urine and amniotic fluid SELDI profile, four differentially expressed masses with the same m/z of 4188, 6451, 11744 and 23425 Da, coexists in the serum, urine and amniotic fluid. the same peaks of serum, urine and amniotic fluid proteomic profile of mothers with NTD-affected fetuses were detected serum mass spectra of 2 mothers with NTD-affected fetuses were compared with those of 2 control mothers. mass-to-change ratio (m/z) ranged between 5300\u20135600 Da. the intensities of 5 of 39 mass peaks were significantly different between NTDs group and normal control group. 4 proteins with m/z of 8320, 8209, 9099 and 10567 Da were up-regulated. 1 peak with m/z of 3458 Da was down-regulated in NTDs group compared to control urine. 7 of 35 mass peaks in NTDs group have significantly different intensity to that of normal control group. 6 proteins with m/z of 14700, 7995, 15891, 16027, 13776 and 11040 Da were up-regulated. 1 peak with m/z of 23417 Da was down-regulated in NTDs group. CART Analysis of Serum, Urine and amniotic fluid SELDI Profile No single peak was identified alone. no peak could completely differentiate the NTD group from the normal control group for serum, urine and amniotic fluid samples. the 4105 da peak was used as the root node in the classification tree to split all samples into two groups. PPV indicates positive predictive value. NPV indicates negative predictive value. the validity and accuracy of the classification tree algorithm were then evaluated by challenging to classify blinded objects correctly in the test set. the validity of the classification tree algorithm was then challenged with. the algorithm correctly classified 86% (31 of 36) of the testing samples with a sensitivity of 89% (17 of 19), specificity of 82% (14 of 17), positive predictive value of 85% (17 of 20) and negative predictive value of 88% (14 of 16) our results yielded sensitivity of 93%, specificity of 89%, positive predictive value of 90% and negative predictive value of 91% (Table. 6). the algorithm correctly classified 89% of the testing samples with a sensitivity of 90% (18 of 20), specificity of 88% (15 of 17), positive predictive value of 90% (18 of 20) and negative predictive value of 88% (15 of 17) the same peaks of serum, urine and amniotic fluid SELDI profile of mothers with NTD-affected fetuses. screening for fetal hydrocephalus has a low sensitivity for fetal hydrocephalus. it is now a routine prenatal test due to its association with second-trimester maternal serum screening for Down syndrome. sensitivity is 80%, and sensitivity is not satisfactory. sensitivity to detect proteins at picomole to attamole range. sensitivity to detect proteins at picomole to attamole range. sensitivity to detect proteins at picomole to attamole range. the ultimate clinical application of protein profiling is for the early detection of NTDs from the maternal body fluid, such as serum or urine. not all differentially expressed protein peaks were used in the CART analysis. it was noted that not all differentially expressed protein peaks were used in the CART analysis. the comparative proteomic study of AFSs from rat fetuses with spina bifida aperta may provide new insights in neural tube defects and contribute to the prenatal screening. this study suggests that NTDs-specific proteomic signatures are likely to present in serum, urine, and amniotic fluid of mothers carrying a NTDs fetus. if ultrasound is not enough, we think, SELDI-TOF-MS can serve as an additional method for NTDs pregnancy detection because of its relatively high sensitivity and specificity."}
