{"summary": "it is cost-prohibitive to treat every (re)emerging agent as the etiologic agent of the next pandemic. the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)5 is a very attractive target for both the design of broad spectrum, antiviral therapies and mechanism-based strategies for viral attenuation and vaccine development. mutagenesis of the RdRp or the proofreading exonuclease can lead to increased genetic diversity but nevertheless decreases virus fitness. the ability to rationally design RdRp derivatives with increased or decreased nucleotide incorporation fidelity would be of great practical value. a conformational change step has been implicated in the high fidelity G64S RdRp (6). a conformational rearrangement of conserved residues is required for stable binding of an incoming nucleotide. shown is the WT PV RdRp-RNA complex (PDB code 3OL6) (19) conserved structural motifs are essential for faithful, efficient, nucleotide addition. the closest structure to the catalytic state solved is for a complex after nucleotide incorporation. every residue shown has had to undergo a conformational change relative to the binary complex for nucleotide addition to occur. this study exploited the PV H273R and G64S RdRp to interrogate the basis for nucleotide incorporation fidelity. fusion plasmid were grown at 30 \u00b0C overnight in 100 ml of NZCYM medium supplemented with kanamycin at 25 g/ml (K25), chloramphenicol at 20 g/ml (C20), and dextrose at 0.1%. cells were chilled to 25 \u00b0C and induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) the fraction of proteins containing RdRp was pelleted by centrifugation at 25,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C. the pellet was suspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 20% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 60 m ZnCl2) the protein was stripped from the Q-Sepharose column using 500 mm NaCl in buffer B. the concentrated protein (10 mg/ml) was stored at 80 \u00b0C. the enzyme solution (4 m), WT or H273R, was incubated. the correct nucleotide (UTP) and nucleotide with an incorrect sugar (2\u2032-dUTP) was achieved by using the symmetric RNA duplex S/S-UG substrate (Eurofins Genomics) with the sequence 5\u2032-GpyrCAUGGGCCCG-3\u2032. pyrC or pyrrolo-C at the +1 templating position is a fluorescent analog of the cytidine nucleoside that retains its Watson-Crick base fluorescence was plotted as a function of time and fit to a single exponential equation (Equation 1), yielding an observed rate constant, kobs, where A is the amplitude and C is the end point. the SDKIE was calculated as the quotient kpol (H2O)/kpol (D2O) crystals of H273R were grown using vapor diffusion at 20 \u00b0C. for data collection, crystals were soaked briefly in the crystallization solution, adjusted to contain 20% glycerol as a cryoprotectant, prior to flash-cooling in a nitrogen stream. the primer-template RNA of the crystal structure was trimmed to include only nucleotides within 5 distance from protein atoms. the initial simulated structure (termed WT-RNA) included protein residues 1\u2013461 (chain A), a 13-mer RNA template strand (chain B), a 9-mer RNA primer strand (chain C) and 153 structural waters. each system was energy-minimized by applying convergence criteria for the energy gradient DRMS (the root-mean-square of the Cartesian elements of the gradient) each system was slowly heated to 300 K over a period of 150 ps under conditions of constant volume and temperature (NVT) and applying a Berendsen thermostat (43) principal component analysis (PCA) PCA (46, 47) was carried out to separate major motions from irrelevant noise sampled during MD simulations over the last 75 ns. ri represents the coordinates x, y, and z of the Ci atom; rj represents the coordinates x, y, and z of the Cj atom in the average structure; t denotes the time average over the MD trajectory. the PCA values were mapped onto the structure as shown in Fig. 9. backbone of functional residues contribute more to overall motions observed for the H273R RdRp-RNA complex relative to WT. matrix was visualized and analyzed using MATLAB 2012b (MathWorks, Natick, MA) for completely correlated motions c(i,j) = 1 and for completely anti-correlated motions c(i,j) = 1. Complete correlation indicates that the motions have the same phase as well as the same period. a Bruker Advance III 600 MHz spectrometer was equipped with a 5-mm inverse detection triple resonance (1H/13C/15N) single axis gradient TCI cryoprobe. a, structural model of H273R RdRp (green) is superimposed onto the structure of WT RdRp (gray) the larger Arg side chain is accommodated without any steric issues. cluster analysis of the last 100 ns of the MD trajectories of the free and binary complex was performed as described under \u201cMaterials and Methods\u201d Shown is the NTP-binding site. for the free enzyme, the binding-occluded conformation predominated (H273R, Binding-occluded) the binding-competent conformation predominated (H273R-RNA, Binding-competent) the distance between Arg174-NH2 and Asp238-OD1 atoms was used as a probe of the binding-occluded (7 ) or binding-competent state. the binding-occluded conformation was present 70% of the time for H273R; the binding-competent conformation was present 98% of the time for H273R-RNA the duration of time each C atom spends in a predetermined, residue-specific volume is calculated. inflexible residues will have the longest residence time. the palm subdomain exhibited the least flexibility for both enzymes. we calculated the cross-correlation of the dynamics for all C atoms of both the WT and H273R RdRp-RNA complexes. instead of plotting data for all 461 C atoms, we only plotted residues with known functional significance. for simplicity of presentation, the analogous pairs on opposite side of the diagonal were not highlighted. the distance between Arg174-NH2 and Asp238-OD1 atoms was used as a probe of the binding-occluded (7 ) or binding-competent state. the binding-competent conformation was present 95% of the time for G64S and 71% of the time for G64S-RNA. correlation scores range from +1 (blue, positive correlation) to 1 (brown, negative correlation) the red outline indicates residues of the G64S RdRp-RNA complex that differ from WT. for simplicity of presentation, the analogous pairs on the opposite side of the diagonal were not highlighted. the environment of Met-187 in T362I RdRp appears substantially different from WT when bound to a nucleotide with an incorrect base. the nascent base pair is shown, as modeled from the post-incorporation complex (PDB code 3OL7) an isotope-trapping experiment was performed for the H273R RdRp-RNA complex. the line represents the mechanism described in A, with K2 = 3.0 and kchem = 30 s1. this data are consistent with H273R making the conformational change step more facile. binding-occluded state (A) and binding-competent state (B) are shown. the stability of the nucleotide binding-competent state should be proportional to the number of interactions between the enzyme and nucleotide. the stability of the nucleotide binding-competent state should be proportional to the number of interactions between the enzyme and nucleotide. cell pellets were washed once with buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA and stored at 80 \u00b0C. lysate was stirred for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C and centrifuged at 25,000 rpm. sample was loaded onto a phosphocellulose column that was pre-equilibrated with buffer A containing 50 mm NaCl (1 ml bed volume/20 mg of total protein was used) the protein was stripped from the Q-Sepharose column using 500 mm NaCl in buffer B. the enzyme solution (4 m), WT or H273R, was incubated with a symmetrical self-complementary 10-nt RNA substrate containing uracil as the templating base for the first incorporation (S/S-U, 20 m). reactions at various time points were either pulse-quenched or pulse-chased by adding a large excess of ATP (20 mm) (Sigma) to proceed for an additional 30 s. all reactions were conducted at 30 \u00b0C in the reaction buffer. for PV RdRp, WT or H273R, similar assays were performed. for each experiment, at least four fluorescent traces were averaged. kpol, the maximum rate constant for nucleotide incorporation, and Kd,app, the apparent dissociation constant for nucleotide. the SDKIE was calculated as the quotient kpol/kpol (H2O) the data were integrated, merged, and scaled using DENZO and SCALEPACK (29). the structure was determined by molecular replacement in PHASER (CCP4) (30) using the structure of WT PV RdRp (PDB 1RA6) (18) as the search model. the model was built using Coot (31, 32) and refined with REFMAC5 (33, 34) the steric clashes generated in the mutants were removed by subsequent energy minimization and equilibration. each system was subjected to two cycles of energy minimization followed by short constrained dynamics (100 ps) each system was slowly heated to 300 K over a period of 150 ps. this was followed by a 200-ps NVT dynamics before switching to NPT dynamics for another 150 ps. all MD simulations were carried out using the parallel version of PMEMD in AMBER12. the starting coordinates for the WT binary complex were obtained from the crystal structure (PDB code 3OL6). the initial simulated structure (termed WT-RNA) included protein residues 1\u2013461 (chain A), a 13-mer RNA template strand (chain B), a 9-mer RNA primer strand (chain C) and 153 structural waters. each system was energy-minimized by applying convergence criteria for the energy gradient DRMS (the root-mean-square of the Cartesian elements of the gradient) each system was heated to 300 K over a period of 150 ps under conditions of constant volume and temperature (NVT) each system was slowly heated to 300 K over a period of 150 ps. simulations for the two mutant systems (termed WT and G64S) started from the end of the previous 25-ns trajectories. the solved crystal structure (PDB code 4R0E) was used to prepare the initial model. the two surface residues Asp-446 and Asp-455 introduced to help in crystallization were mutated back to the WT residues Leu-446 and Arg-455 respectively. a version of AMBER99bsc0 (38) with improved parameters for nucleic acid. an integration time step of 1 fs was used in all simulations. electrostatic interactions were treated using the particle mesh Ewald method. all MD simulations were carried out on 128 Intel Xeon X5675 Six-Core processors managed by the high performance computing group. the refinement \u201cmeans\u201d algorithm (45) in PTRAJ was used to cluster the structures extracted at 20-ps intervals across the trajectories. gonalization of the matrix S produced an orthogonal set of eigenvectors (or modes) that describe the directions of maximum variation in the observed conformational space sampled during simulations. for each C atom, contributions to the total variance along the top 10 modes were summed and normalized to the average of the least contributing residues. the radii of the tubes indicate the magnitude of the PCA values on a scale from largest radius (2.4) to smallest radius (2.4). the radii of the tubes indicate the magnitude of the PCA values on a scale from largest radius (2.4) to smallest radius (2.4). a cage was identified when the distance between three consecutive centers of mass varied less than 5%. we considered that an atom left its cage when it spent more than 6 consecutive ps outside of it. this analysis brings new insights to the dynamics of the relatively less mobile atoms. r.m.s.d. values for the sugar-phosphate backbone of the primer RNA (cyan) and template RNA (blue) of the RNA substrate were plotted. the proteins exhibited no dramatic fluctuations after 50 ns. the last 100 ns of the trajectories were used for analysis. the binding-occluded conformation was present 88% of the time for WT. the binding-occluded conformation was present 98% of the time for H273R-RNA. the binding-occluded conformation was present 70% of the time for H273R. each panel shows the distribution of interatomic distances for the indicated pair during the MD simulation. the WT RdRp-RNA complex is abbreviated as WT and shown in black. the H273R RdRp-RNA complex is abbreviated as WT and shown in black. shown is a box plot of the residence time for the two complexes. the lower and upper ends of the box indicate the cutoff for 25 and 75% of the data, respectively. the lower and upper whiskers extending from the box indicate the minimum and maximum values of the data. dihedral angles for lysine are indicated; the arrow indicates the \u201cplus\u201d direction. polar coordinate system from 180\u00b0 to +180\u00b0 was used to plot each dihedral angle. in all cases, no more than three clusters (conformations) were observed. the residence time experiment described in Fig. 7 was performed for the G64S RdRp-RNA complex. the lower and upper ends of the box indicate the cutoff for 25 and 75% of the data, respectively. the lower and upper whiskers extending from the box indicate the cutoff for 25 and 75% of the data, respectively. in H273R RdRp, a unique Met-187 resonance was not observed for the H273R RdRp-RNA-UTP complex. both an incorrect base and an incorrect sugar are \u201csensed\u201d in the ternary complex. in the post-incorporation complex, Met-187 interacts with Phe-296. the motif-B loop, which contains Ser-288, is not in a catalytically competent conformation. the vicinity of this loop to the base pair likely links changes in Met-187 to both RNA and nucleotide binding. the data are plotted, and the line represents the mechanism described in A. the line represents the mechanism described in A, with K2 = 3.0 and kchem = 30 s1. kinetic simulation was used to obtain estimates for K2 and kchem. error-prone activity of the H273R RdRp was limited to base mispairing. we evaluated the ability of this enzyme to utilize a nucleotide with an incorrect sugar configuration (Table 1, 2\u2032-dUTP) and the ability of this enzyme to extend a mispaired primer terminus (Table 1, S/S-UG RNA) the x-ray crystal structure of the H273R RdRp was unable to show a significant difference relative to WT. a root-mean-square deviation (r.m.s.d.) was 0.33, which was essentially no change. most of the changes were localized to the site of the substitution. b Rmerge = |Ih Ih|/Ih, over all h where Ih is the intensity of reflection h. c Rcryst and Rfree = Fo| |Fc/ |Fo| were calculated using the 5% of data excluded from the refinement. analysis of the r.m.s.d. of the backbone of the stable core of the protein (palm subdomain) revealed that all trajectories had reached stability by 50 ns (Fig. 3). the average r.m.s.d. value decreased when RNA was bound (compare each enzyme in the absence and presence of RNA shown in Fig. 3) binding-occluded conformation was the only state observed for WT RdRp. in contrast, both a binding-occluded state and a binding-competent state were observed once RNA was bound. the presence of RNA caused sampling of the two states to occur more often. the presence of RNA shifted nearly all of the observed conformations to those that would be classified as binding-competent. the binding-occluded state predominated (70% of the whole simulation time) once was sampled. the H273R RdRp-RNA complex existed most of the time (98% of the whole simulation time) oration complex by comparing the distances between several side chains. we determined the distance between the indicated residues at 1-ps intervals over the last 75 ns of simulation for both the WT and H273R RdRp-RNA complexes. the data for the WT and H273R RdRp-RNA complexes are shown in Fig. 7A. the median residence time was 100 ps. the palm subdomain was the least flexible. the most striking difference between the WT and H273R RdRp-RNA complexes was that the H273R RdRp-RNA complex exhibited a substantial increase in the number and intensity of the positively correlated residues. a similar trend existed for the positive correlation between residues interacting with the templating base and residues interacting with the nucleotide substrate. the number of modes is equivalent to the number of atoms evaluated multiplied by three. each principal component is associated with an eigenvalue that defines its magnitude of motion. a relative displacement was calculated by normalizing to the average displacement observed for the least flexible 5% of residues. residues in conserved structural motifs exhibiting differences with an absolute value greater than 0.3 are listed in Fig. 9C. seven of the 10 listed active-site residues demonstrated positive PCA values. analysis of the side chain dihedrals used dial plots to present the conformational space sampled by the dihedrals (180\u00b0 to +180\u00b0) at 1-ps intervals. lysine side chain has four dihedral angles: 1, 2, 3, and 4 (Fig. 10B) p The very first PV RdRp derivative exhibiting perturbed incorporation fidelity contained the G64S substitution but conferred a high fidelity (anti-mutator) phenotype (6, 8) in a previous study, we performed a MD analysis of the unbound G64S RdRp (23) in that study we observed changes between the dynamics of that G64S and WT RdRp that were on par with that observed between WT PV RdRp and WT residues of motif A (residues 235\u2013238) in the G64S RdRp-RNA complex, in contrast to the H273R RdRp-RNA complex, have shorter residence times than that of WT RdRp-RNA (p 0.05) the residence time analysis revealed that residues of motif A (residues 235\u2013238) in the G64S RdRp-RNA complex, in contrast to the H273R RdR the resonance for H273R RdRp senses transitions of the WT enzyme from the free protein to the binary complex and to the ternary complex. the addition of nucleotide failed to cause a detectable change in the Met-187 resonance. the Met-187 resonance was the same regardless of the correctness of the bound nucleotide. we reported previously a PV RdRp derivative with reduced stringency of selection against nucleotides with an incorrect sugar configuration (21) this derivative changed Thr-362 of motif D to Ile (T362I RdRp) (21) this derivative changed Thr-362 of motif D to Ile (T362I RdRp) (21) this derivative senses nucleotide binding. however, binding of a nucleotide with an incorrect base pair leads to a Met a faster conformational change step (less rate-limiting) will yield a SDKIE larger than that observed for the WT. we measured the SDKIE for H273R RdRp during correct nucleotide incorporation, incorporation of nucleotide with an incorrect sugar configuration, and extension of a mispaired primer terminus. we performed this experiment herein for both the WT and H273R. these data are consistent with at least a 2-fold increase in K2 for H273R. this is a lower limit, as essentially all of the pulsed nucleotide is chased into product as fast as it can be measured. kpol Kd,app

was attributed to differences related to dynamics (23). we pursued the x-ray crystal structure of the H273R RdRp to make sure that we did not miss any significant structural perturbations. Rfree was calculated using the 5% of data excluded from the refinement. Previously, we performed 25-ns all-atom and 1 s coarse-grained MD simulations of four picornaviral RdRp (23, 24) these studies revealed conserved and correlated motions of the conserved structural/functional motifs comprising the RdRp active site. most of this flexibility derived from the n + 2 to n + 4 regions of template that interact with the fingers subdomain away from the active site. the binding-occluded conformation was the only state observed for WT RdRp. the binding-occluded conformation was the only state observed for WT RdRp. the presence of RNA caused the sampling of the two states to occur more often, with the population of each state essentially equal (Fig. 4B). Previously, we performed 25-ns all-atom and 1 s coarse-grained MD simulations of four picornaviral RdRp (23, 24) these studies revealed conserved and correlated motions of the conserved structural/functional motifs comprising the RdRp active site. the binding-occluded conformation was the only state observed for WT RdRp and the WT RdRp-RNA complex. the binding-occluded conformation was the only state observed for WT RdRp. the presence of RNA caused sampling of the two states to occur more often, with the population of each state essentially equal (Fig. 4B). Previously, we performed 25-ns all-atom and 1 s coarse-grained MD simulations of four picornaviral RdRp (23, 24) these studies revealed conserved and correlated motions of the conserved structural/functional motifs comprising the RdRp active site. binding-occluded conformation was the only state observed for WT RdRp. the binding-occluded conformation was the only state observed for WT RdRp. the binding-occluded conformation was the only state observed for WT RdRp. H273R RdRp-RNA complex was favored by H273R RdRp. in the absence of RNA, the nucleotide binding-occluded state was favored by H273R RdRp. the average structure of this state was similar to that observed for WT. complexes for WT and H273R observed by MD. significant differences in positions of Arg-174 and Asp-238 were also evident. similar residues showed the largest positional differences. we performed a \u201cresidence time\u201d analysis to obtain information about differences in regions of RdRp exhibiting the most motion. this analysis provides a kinetic perspective of the motions that is hidden in other analyses, such as a B-factor analysis. all of these residues exhibited longer residence times in the H273R RdRp-RNA complex than observed for the WT complex. the strongest correlated motions, both positive and negative, were observed for functional motifs. the strongest correlated motions, both positive and negative, were observed for functional motifs. residues of motif A (Asp-233 to Asp-238) appeared positively correlated with each other in H273R RdRp-RNA relative to WT RdRp-RNA. in the absence of RNA, the nucleotide binding-occluded state was favored by H273R RdRp. the average structure of this state was similar to that observed for WT. RNA Complex Resembles the post-incorporation complex Observed Crystallographically. we also performed a comparison of the average structures of the RdRp-RNA complexes for WT and H273R observed by MD. H273R RdRp-RNA complex exhibit reduced backbone dynamics. previous MD studies of picornaviral RdRp emphasized changes in dynamics occurring for residues, structural elements, and/or domains exhibiting the most motion. we focused our attention on residues of the palm known to contribute to nucleotide binding and/or catalysis. all of these residues exhibited longer residence times in the H273R RdRp-RNA complex than for the WT complex. residues interacting with the templating base (Thr-114, Ser-115, Lys-159, Leu-175, Ile-176, Ala-178, and Ser-179) and residues interacting with the nucleotide substrate (Thr-235, Gly-236, Tyr-237, and Asp-238) appeared more positively correlated with each other in H273R RdRp-RNA relative to WT RdRp-RNA. RNA complex existed most of the time (98% of the whole simulation time) in binding-competent state. a comparison of the average structures of the RdRp-RNA complexes for WT and H273R observed by MD. RNA complex were closest to those observed in the post-incorporation complex. the level of coincidence was not as observed for the binary complex. previous MD studies of picornaviral RdRp emphasized changes in dynamics. this analysis identified 109 residues exhibiting statistically significant differences (p 0.05) between the complexes. of these, only 11 residues became more flexible (shorter residence time) in the H273R RdRp-RNA complex. a similar trend existed for the positive correlation between residues interacting with the templating base (Thr-114, Ser-115, Lys-159, Leu-175, Ile-176, Ala-178, and Ser-179) residues of motif A (Asp-233 to Asp-238) appeared more positively correlated with each other in H273R RdRp-RNA relative to WT RdRp-RNA. we used the top 10 modes to compare the WT and H273R RdRp-RNA complexes. a relative displacement was calculated by normalizing to the average displacement observed for the least flexible 5% of residues. a PCA value of zero means that no change was observed between the two complexes. determinants for substrate binding are substantially more flexible in the H273R RdRp-RNA complex relative to the WT complex. the average structure of the WT RdRp-RNA complex observed during the simulation represents the nucleotide binding-occluded state. in going from the occluded to the competent state there is a rearrangement of motif F (Tyr-157, Lys-159, Arg-174, and Ile-176) and motif G/G angles 1 3 of the H273R RdRp-RNA complex sampled unique conformations relative to the WT complex. we used k-means algorithm in MATLAB R2102b (MathWorks) to cluster the observed conformations. in general, the conformational space sampled by the dihedrals was trimodal (Fig. 10C) conserved structural motifs (A, D, E, F, and G/G\u2032) exhibited the largest amplitude of motions. a relative displacement was calculated by normalizing to the average displacement observed for the least flexible 5% of residues. seven of the 10 listed active-site residues demonstrated positive PCA values. we concluded that enzyme determinants for substrate binding are substantially more flexible in the H273R RdRp-RNA complex relative to the WT complex. the lysine side chain has four dihedral angles: 1, 2, 3, and 4. the position of each angle can be defined by a polar coordinate. angles 1 3 of the H273R RdRp-RNA complex sampled unique conformations relative to the WT complex. conserved structural motifs (A, D, E, F, and G/G\u2032) exhibited the largest amplitude of motions. a relative displacement was calculated by normalizing to the average displacement observed for the least flexible 5% of residues. residues in conserved structural motifs exhibiting differences with an absolute value greater than 0.3 are listed in Fig. 9C. all of the residues shown interact with the triphosphate or ribose of the nucleotide substrate. analysis of the side chain dihedrals used dial plots to present the conformational space sampled by the dihedrals at 1-ps intervals. the lysine side chain has four dihedral angles: 1, 2, 3, and 4. the position of each angle can be defined by a polar coordinate and plotted accordingly. in a previous study, we performed a MD analysis of the unbound G64S RdRp (23) we observed changes between the dynamics of that G64S and WT RdRp that were on par with that observed between WT PV RdRp and WT foot-and-mouth disease virus RdRp (23). the PV and foot and mouth disease virus enzymes share only 30% sequence identity (23). residues of motif A (residues 235\u2013238) in the G64S RdRp-RNA complex, in contrast to the H273R RdRp-RNA complex, have shorter residence times than that of WT RdRp-RNA. the residence time analysis revealed that residues of motif A (residues 235\u2013238) in the G64S RdRp-RNA complex, in contrast to the H273R RdRp-RNA the resonance for Met-187 senses transitions of the WT enzyme from the free protein to the binary complex and to the ternary complex. the addition of nucleotide failed to cause a detectable change in the Met-187 resonance (Fig. 12A, H273R), a state that is not achieved in the H273R RdRp. this derivative changed Thr-362 of motif D to Ile (T362I RdRp) (21). binding of a nucleotide with an incorrect sugar configuration leads to a Met-187 resonance that is coincident with that of a correct nucleotide. a faster conformational change step (less rate-limiting) will yield a SDKIE larger than that observed for the WT. we measured the SDKIE for H273R RdRp during correct nucleotide incorporation, incorporation of nucleotide with an incorrect sugar configuration, and extension of a mispaired primer terminus. a 2-fold increase in K2 for H273R RdRp. essentially all of the pulsed nucleotide is chased into product as fast as it can be measured using the chemical quench-flow device (Fig. 13C) ide with an incorrect base pair and a nucleotide with an incorrect sugar configuration. the Met-187 resonance was the same regardless of the correctness of the bound nucleotide. the lost conformational sampling of the Met-187 side chain was also observed in our MD simulations. kinetic mechanism for PV RdRp includes conformational change step preceding nucleotidyl transfer. equilibrium constant for this step is 0.6, imposing a barrier for correct nucleotide incorporation that is partially rate-limiting for nucleotide addition. a faster conformational change step (less rate-limiting) will yield a SDKIE larger than that observed for WT. using an isotope-trapping experiment, [-32P]NTP was pulsed into the reaction. the reaction was either quenched or chased by the addition of an excess of unlabeled NTP. the equilibrium constant for the conformational change step (K2) would determine any difference in the observed kinetics of [-32P]NMP incorporation. the Met-187 resonance was the same regardless of the correctness of the bound nucleotide. for the H273R RdRp-RNA complex, the Met-187 resonance was the same regardless of the correctness of the bound nucleotide. the lost conformational sampling of the Met-187 between WT and H273R was also observed in our MD simulations. the kinetic mechanism for PV RdRp includes a conformational change step preceding nucleotidyl transfer. the equilibrium constant for this step for WT is 0.6, imposing a barrier for correct nucleotide incorporation. a faster conformational change step (less rate-limiting) will yield a SDKIE larger than that observed for the WT. in all cases, the SDKIE observed for H273R RdRp was always higher than that observed for WT. we conclude that the conformational change step is no longer effective as a fidelity checkpoint because of an increase in the equilibrium constant for this step. we used an isotope-trapping experiment (16) to get a better idea of the magnitude of the change in the equilibrium constant for this step. fidelity of nucleotide addition by viral RdRp is a determinant of viral virulence. fidelity of nucleotide addition by viral RdRp is a target for antiviral therapy. fidelity of nucleotide addition by viral RdRp is a determinant of viral virulence. the fidelity of nucleotide addition is not known. our previous MD simulations showed that the conserved structural motifs could not explain the functional change. observations made for PV RdRp were reproduced with three other picornaviral RdRp. one of the most unexpected observations was that the nucleotide-binding pocket remained in an occlude state. this observation was expected, as ligand binding often leads to reduced protein flexibility. in the nucleotide binding-competent state, the RdRp interacts with all functional groups on the nucleotide. in the absence of a 2\u2032-OH, for example, Ser-288 and Asn-297 might remain in the nucleotide binding-occluded conformation, leading to expulsion of this nucleotide with an incorrect sugar configuration. luded and nucleotide binding-competent states observed on nanosecond timescale are related to the conformational change step linked to fidelity observed on the millisecond timescale (16). two observations are consistent with this possibility. a complete disruption of the interactions, especially of residues participating in multivalent interactions, will not represent the best strategy. both substitutions perturbed the fidelity of the RdRp but debilitated the corresponding mutant virus to an extent that would preclude any practical use of the mutant viruses. enhanced flexibility of the active site may also contribute to the relaxed specificity observed for H273R RdRp. the closure of motif D to permit Lys-359 to donate a proton to the pyrophosphate leaving group (53) the simulation would suggest that stable interaction of Lys-359 with the pyrophosphate will release its interaction with Asp-233. this residue will contribute to formation of the binding site of the divalent cation essential for catalysis. 187 resonances in the NMR experiment are governed by the conformation of the motif-B loop. the side chain of Met-286 located in the motif-B loop moves from a site remote from the Met-187 side chain to a site nearby the Met-187. the conformational change of the motif-B loop facilitates the interaction of Ser-288 with nucleotide. substitutions in motif B that stabilized the down conformation were more efficient than those that stabilized the up conformation (61). Interestingly, the C290V RdRp was 3-fold more active than WT, and we have shown that this derivative exhibits a mutator phenotype in vitro. simulations of high fidelity mutant G64S revealed active-site residues. these dysfunctional dynamics exhibit the greatest adverse effect on an incorrect nucleotide. the concept of creating dysfunctional dynamics to perturb RdRp fidelity may have merit. the presence of the ribose 2\u2032-hydroxyl will trap the motif-B loop in the catalytically competent conformation. the presence of the ribose 2\u2032-hydroxyl will trap the motif-B loop in the catalytically competent conformation by interacting with Ser-288, Asn-297, and Asp-238 (supplemental Movie S2)"}
