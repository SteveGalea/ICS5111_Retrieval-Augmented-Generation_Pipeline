{"summary": "CHIKV is endemic in Africa, India, and Southeast Asia. mutation in the CHIKV envelope glycoprotein 1 enabled viral transmission through Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. CHIKV causes a debilitating rheumatic disease, characterized by arthritis. CHIKV genome encodes two envelope glycoproteins, E2 and E1, derived from a larger polyprotein precursor (capsid/E3/E2/6K/E1) and are embedded in the viral membrane. the majority of antibodies triggered by CHIKV infection appear to target the viral envelope glycoprotein E2 (29, 30) IM-CKV063 neutralized virus and protected mice in two CHIKV animal models. fusion loop MAbs neither demonstrated neutralizing ability in vitro nor offered protection from lethality in mice. fab phage display library constructed from peripheral blood donated by three CHIKV-infected individuals. RNA was converted to cDNA using a superscript first-strand synthesis system for reverse transcription-PCR (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). individual Fab peripreparations were prepared from single colonies by induction with 1 mM IPTG (isopropyl--d-thiogalactopyranoside) Candidate Fabs were converted to human IgG1 format for production in HEK293T cells. phage-derived Fab variable domains were subcloned downstream of the human interleukin-2 signal sequence and upstream of either human IgG1 heavy-chain (1) or human IgG1 light-chain (1) constant domains. the mixture was spun for 30 min at 7,000 rpm and 4\u00b0C using a rotor. the medium was aspirated and 25 ml HEPES buffered saline (HBS; 150 mM NaCl, pH 8.0) was added to resuspend the precipitated VLPs. the sample was spun for 3 h at 31,000 rpm and 4\u00b0C. in total, 910 CHIKV envelope mutants were generated (98.5% coverage) the sequences were confirmed, and the mutants were arrayed into 384-well plates at one mutant per well. cells were stained with purified MAbs IM-CKV057, IM-CKV061, IM-CKV062, and IM-CKV067. MAbs were detected using 3.75 g/ml Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) in 10% NGS. cells were washed twice with PBS without calcium or magnesium (PBS/) and resuspended in cellstripper solution (Cellgro, Manassas, VA) CHIKV VLPs diluted to 20 g/ml were loaded for 45 min. IM-CKV063 was prepared as a 2-fold serial dilution. nonspecific binding was assessed using sensor tips without VLPs. ninety-six-well white, flat-bottom microtiter plates were coated with retroviral VLPs containing CHIKV E2/E1 at 5.0 g/well or CHIKV VLPs at 0.5 g/ml. the particles were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. for the comparative retroviral/CHIKV VLP ELISA, primary MAb was diluted to a previously optimized concentration. target HEK293T cells were plated at 0.4 106 cells/well in DMEM. serial dilutions of MAb and virus preincubated for 45 min. serially diluted MAbs were mixed with S27 diluted to 400 PFU/ml. mice were infected with 5 105 PFU of CHIKV (strain S27; the strain was expanded and the titer was determined in Vero cells) intradermally in the ventral thorax. each mouse was intraperitoneally injected with test MAb or control human IgG. the ability of MAbs to protect against the arthralgia induced by CHIKV infection was evaluated in an arthritic mouse model as previously described (55). female C57BL/6 mice (8 weeks old) were inoculated with CHIKV (LR2006-OPY-1 strain; 104 log10 50% cell culture infectivity doses [CCID50s]) or heat-inactivated CHIKV in 20 l DMEM. log 50% effective concentrations (EC50s) were compared using Prism's extra sum-of-squares F test. other values were compared using Student's t test. Fab phage display library constructed from peripheral blood donated by three CHIKV-infected individuals. 0.25 g of protein per well in 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.6. Fabs in 4% PBSM were added to each well, and the plate was incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C with gentle agitation. the plate was washed 3 times with PBS plus 0.01% Tween 20. CHIKV VLPs were produced by transfecting HEK293T cells with an expression plasmid encoding a codon-optimized chimera between O'Nyong-Nyong virus capsid and CHIKV E3/E2/E1. after production for 2 to 3 days, the supernatant was filtered through a 0.22-m-pore-size filter (catalog number 430517; Corning) the resuspension was added to a small Beckman Ultra-Clear centrifuge tube. the sample was spun for 3 h at 31,000 rpm and 4\u00b0C using an SW-41 rotor. after the sample was spun, the suspension and sucrose layer were aspirated. 4% paraformaldehyde (PBS) in PBS plus calcium and magnesium (PBS++) cells were stained with purified MAbs IM-CKV057 (0.25 g/ml), IM-CKV061 (0.75 g/ml), IM-CKV062 (0.75 g/ml), IM-CKV065 (1.0 g/ml), and IM-CKV067 (1.0 g/ml) each mutant E2/E1 clone relative to the reactivity against wild-type E2/E1 protein were calculated by subtracting the signal from mock-transfected controls. mutated residues within critical clones were identified to be critical to the MAb epitope if they did not support the reactivity of the test MAb. E26D9 at 25 g/ml in 10 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.5) was then immobilized on the sensor tips with a 10-min incubation. CHIKV VLPs diluted to 20 g/ml were loaded for 45 min, followed by another 10 min of stabilization. primary MAb was diluted to 2 g/ml in blocking buffer. diluted MAb allowed to incubate for 1 h at room temperature (22\u00b0C), 37\u00b0C, or 45\u00b0C. plates were washed 3 times with PBS/, then HRP-conjugated rabbit antihuman secondary antibody diluted 1:5,000 in blocking buffer. a spinoculation was performed at 2,000 rpm for 60 min at 20\u00b0C. infected target cells were lysed at 48 h postinfection. lysates were assayed for luciferase activity. mice were infected with 5 105 PFU of CHIKV (strain S27; the strain was expanded and the titer was determined in Vero cells) each mouse was intraperitoneally injected with test MAb or control human IgG in 0.2 ml PBS immediately prior to CHIKV infection. CHIKV-infected mice (n = 5 mice per group) were inoculated by a shallow subcutaneous injection into the top, toward the lateral side, of each hind foot in the metatarsal region. IM-CKV063 with endotoxin levels below 10 endotoxin units/mg were used. phage library was panned using virus-like particles (VLPs) with retroviral cores (from murine leukemia virus Gag) that present CHIKV envelope proteins E2 and E1. two different VLP types and slightly different panning protocols were used to increase the chances of isolating diverse MAbs. genes encoding the MAb heavy and light chains were sequenced and cloned into full-length human IgG1 vectors for MA the majority of the clones tested showed at least a 10:1 selectivity for the target. IM-CKV057, IM-CKV061, IM-CKV062, and IM-CKV067 have identical heavy chains but different light chains. each MAb was also shown to be immunoreactive against CHIKV E2/E1 expressed on HEK293T cells. our previously described neutralizing MAb, C9 (32), was selectively reactive with CHIKV and SFV envelopes, as was the newly isolated MAb IM-CKV063, suggesting that the epitopes are relatively conserved between these two alphaviruses. at least two replicate values were obtained for each experiment. es CHIKV, SFV, RRV, and SINV expressed on HEK293T cells. samples were either fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde or left unfixed. as a control, cells were permeabilized for immunodetection of the V5 epitope tag engineered onto the C terminus. IM-CKV065 demonstrated high reactivity with E2/E1 presented on cells. but low reactivity when E2/E1 was presented in the context of retroviral and CHIKV VLPs. IM-CKV063 is a highly potent CHIKV-neutralizing human MAb. MAb IM-CKV063 neutralized CHIKV pseudoviruses with an average IC50 of 7.4 ng/ml. anti-CHIKV MAbs were tested for the ability to neutralize infectivity of reporter HIV isolates pseudotyped with CHIKV S27 E2/E1 (A) or the VSV envelope (B) IM-CKV063 was selective for CHIKV E2/E1. this MAb did not neutralize viruses bearing envelopes of other alphaviruses. it is possible that its lower level of reactivity with SFV is not sufficient for neutralization. IM-CKV063 showed a specific association with immobilized E2/E1. it did not demonstrate nonspecific binding in the absence of CHIKV VLPs. IM-CKV063 showed a strong binding affinity to E2/E1. IM-CKV063 binding to CHIKV E2/E1 was measured starting at 400 s. an apparent binding affinity of 320 pM was calculated for IM-CKV065. IM-CKV063 is protective in animal models of CHIKV infection. MAb IM-CKV063 provides therapeutic protection in mouse models of CHIKV pathogenesis. IM-CKV057, IM-CKV066, and nonspecific human anti-HCV antibody controls were also tested. all mice died within 9 days of infection. IM-CKV063 was tested for the ability to protect against foot swelling in an adult mouse model. mice were injected intraperitoneally with 100 g of MAb concurrently with the injection of CHIKV. each MAb binds to CHIKV E2/E1 variants. the entire mutation library was transfected into human HEK293T cells in a 384-well array format. each well contained one mutant with a defined substitution. clones with reactivity of 20% relative to that of wild-type CHIKV. IM-CKV063 identified six critical residues whose mutation greatly impaired MAb binding to levels of 20% of that to wild-type E2/E1. bars represent mean and range of at least two replicate data points. each MAb was screened against the CHIKV mutation library. residues E24 and I121 on one E2 subunit form a single MAb binding site together with G55, W64, K66, and R80 on the adjacent E2 subunit within the trimer. the distance between the epitope residues on different heterodimers in the trimer is predicted to be approximately 13, consistent with the size of a MAb binding site. this epitope is predicted to be solvent exposed at neutral pH and easily accessible for binding on the native trimeric structure of the envelope the distance between residue I121 and residue W64 on two different E2 subunits of the trimer is 13. we also mapped the epitopes of the nonneutralizing MAbs IM-CKV057, IM-CKV061, IM-CKV062, and IM-CKV067. all nonneutralizing MAbs bound to epitopes that encompassed the fusion loop region of E1 (residues 83 through 100 s on E1 domain II (T228 and V229) and E2 arch 1 (Q146) are less well conserved than fusion loop residues. the involvement of these residues in MAb binding may explain the lack of reactivity of IM-CKV066 with other alphaviruses. a distinct spatial difference can be observed for the location of neutralizing versus nonneutralizing epitopes. the epitopes for nonneutralizing MAbs are found on the accessible outer face and top of the trimer spike. the epitopes for nonneutralizing MAbs localize to the inner regions of the E2/E1 subunits. all of the published epitopes map to the membrane-distal domains of E2/E1. each individual E2/E1 heterodimeric subunit is shown in a different color for clarity. epitopes on outer-facing surfaces of the trimer correlate with MAbs that are neutralizing. nonneutralizing fusion loop MAbs IM-CKV057, IM-CKV061, IM-CKV062 and IM-CKV067 were essentially nonreactive on cells expressing E2/E1 under native unfixed conditions at room temperature. similar trend was observed when CHIKV E2/E1 was presented on the surface of retroviral VLPs. retroviral VLPs were either fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde at 22\u00b0C or left unfixed. primary MAb was added at the temperatures indicated for 60 min. data points represent mean and standard deviation of three replicates. the effect of temperature on MAb neutralization is shown for a representative nonneutralizing MAb (IM-CKV061) (A), a moderately neutralizing MAb (IM-CKV065) (B), and a strongly neutralizing MAb (IM-CKV063) (C). reporter HIV isolates pseudotyped with CHIKV S27 E2/E1 were preincubated with MAbs at the indicated temperatures. Isolation of human CHIKV MAbs by phage display. phage library was panned using virus-like particles (VLPs) with retroviral cores that present CHIKV envelope proteins E2 and E1. immune phage Fab library was created from the most highly reactive patient samples (red symbols; patients C2, C3, and C4) an immune phage Fab library was created from the most highly reactive patient samples (red symbols; patients C2, C3, and C4). the majority of the clones tested showed at least a 10:1 selectivity for the target. each MAb was shown to be immunoreactive against CHIKV E2/E1 expressed on surface of HEK293T cells. four of the seven MAbs were found to be broadly cross-reactive. two MAbs were selectively reactive with CHIKV E2/E1 alone. surface expression was determined by immunoreactivity with a rabbit polyclonal antibody. data in the surface expression column represent the percentage of rabbit polyclonal antibody immunoreactivity for each mutant relative to that of the wild type. data in the infectivity column represent the functional activity of mutant CHIKV E2/E1 reporter virus relative to that of the wild type. K293T cells expressing CHIKV E2/E1 were either fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde or left unfixed. all data are representative of those from at least two independent experiments. MAbs showed negligible reactivity with controls that included dengue virus VLPs and mock-transfected HEK293T cells. IM-CKV063 is a highly potent CHIKV-neutralizing human MAb. the seven CHIKV-reactive MAbs were tested in cellular neutralization assays. they showed a range of activity, from nonneutralizing (IM-CKV057, IM-CKV061, IM-CKV062, and IM-CKV067) to moderately neutralizing (IM-CKV065; average 50% inhibitory concentration [IC IM-CKV063 was tested for neutralization of additional alphavirus envelope proteins pseudotyped onto reporter HIV isolates. data points represent the mean and standard deviation of two to three replicates and are representative of those from at least two individual experiments. CKV063 demonstrated a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the infectivity of live virus. IM-CKV065 did not neutralize S27 live virus using PRNTs. but did neutralize CHIKV strain 37997 with a PRNT50 value of 81 ng/ml. rapid dissociation of IM-CKV065 led to decreased affinity. the fast dissociation of IM-CKV065 may explain its relatively weak binding to CHIKV VLPs. mice were concurrently inoculated with live virus and test MAbs. complete survival was observed with 100-g, 20-g, and 10-g doses of IM-CKV063. 90% survival was observed with a 4-g dose. survival of >90% was observed at doses of >4 g of IM-CKV063. IM-CKV057, IM-CKV066, and nonspecific human IgG and human anti-HCV antibody controls were also tested. groups of 6 to 7 mice were used for each condition, depending on litter size available. mice received a 100-g intraperitoneal injection of purified IM-CKV063. mice were monitored for foot swelling as described previously. mice injected with CHIKV alone experienced foot swelling at 5 to 6 days. 910 E2/E1 mutations were constructed. each well contained one mutant with a defined substitution. eight positive (wild-type E2/E1) and eight negative (mock-transfected) control wells were included on each plate. IM-CKV063 identified six critical residues whose mutation greatly impaired MAb binding to levels of 20% of that to wild-type E2/E1. this model suggests that these residues form a conformational epitope that lies at the interface of two different E2 subunits. the distance between the epitope residues on different heterodimers in the trimer is predicted to be approximately 13. the IM-CKV063 epitope appears to span two E2 subunits in the trimer. a single epitope crossing two E2 subunits (one gray and one blue) is shown with multicolored residues. the distance between residue I121 and residue W64 on two different E2 subunits of the trimer is 13. IM-CKV057, IM-CKV061, IM-CKV062, and IM-CKV067 bind to identical or overlapping epitopes directly on the fusion loop. epitopes of IM-CKV061 and IM-CKV062 also included the seemingly distant residue E2-M267, which is in fact proximal to fusion loop epitope residues on adjacent heterodimers in the trimeric structure of the protein 57 and IM-CKV067 (A), IM-CKV061 and IM-CKV062 (B) and moderately neutralizing MAb IM-CKV065 (D) are visualized on the heterodimeric and top-down trimeric forms of the CHIKV envelope crystal structure. epitopes for nonneutralizing MAbs localize to the inner regions of the E2/E1 subunits (i.e., facing the interior of the epitope mapping reveals highly immunogenic and neutralizing regions of CHIKV E2/E1. the epitopes of nonneutralizing (IM-CKV057, IM-CKV061, IM-CKV062, IM-CKV066, IM-CKV067) and neutralizing (IM-CKV063, IM-CKV065) MAbs along with additional CHIKV epitopes reported in the literature are boxed. a cutaway view with two subunits made transparent reveals nonneutralizing and fusion loop residues that face the interior of the trimer. Residue E2-E24 is located on the inner face in this view but is part of the cross-subunit epitope formed by neutralizing MAb IM-CKV063. a major portion of E2/E1 is immunogenic in patients but does not elicit neutralizing MAbs. CHIKV MAbs were tested for immunoreactivity on HEK293T cells. cells were either fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min or left unfixed prior to the addition of primary MAb. bars represent the mean of eight replicate data points. fusion loop MAbs IM-CKV057, IM-CKV061, IM-CKV062, and IM-CKV067 showed increased immunoreactivity at 37\u00b0C and 45\u00b0C compared with that at room temperature. these results suggest that fusion loop epitopes are shielded at room temperature in their native state but that both elevated temperature and fixation can increase fusion loop epitope exposure. neutralizing MAb IM-CKV065 has a discontinuous epitope that appears to be sensitive to conformational changes resulting from fixation but not temperature. it is possible that the Lys233 residue of this epitope is cross-linked to paraformaldehyde during fixation, decreasing its ability to interact with IM-CKV065. this is consistent with these neutralizing MAbs targeting a well-exposed epitope on the native infectious virus that contributes to IM-CKV063 is one of the most potent CHIKV MAbs reported to date (IC50, 7.4 ng/ml; PRNT50, 11 ng/ml; PRNT50, 11 ng/ml; PRNT50, 12 ng/ml) IM-CKV063 is one of the most potent human MAbs reported to date. murine MAb IM-CKV063 was protective in vivo in two animal models. IM-CKV063 effectively prevented the arthritis caused by CHIKV. a separate adult mouse model of CHIKV arthritic disease was used. IM-CKV063 binds to a conformational epitope that spans two E2 subunits. a mutation at residue E2-I121, part of the IM-CKV063 epitope, has previously been shown to enhance viral infectivity in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes (63) and allow MAb escape for Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (39), so IM-CKV063 could also block other IM-CKV057, IM-CKV061, IM-CKV062, IM-CKV066, and IM-CKV067 bound overlapping epitopes. the fusion loop MAbs were not capable of neutralizing CHIKV in our assays. the lack of neutralization was further evident in animal studies. fusion loop MAb E1f (which is also nonneutralizing) showed little binding to virus particles under native conditions, binding the fusion loop only when dissociation of the E2/E1 dimer was triggered by low pH (59, 60) it is likely that nonneutralizing fusion loop MAbs have been isolated by others but have been either not characterized as binding the fusion loop or not reported due to their apparent lack of therapeutic potential."}
