{"summary": "PED is an acute and highly contagious disease, which causes severe enteritis, vomiting, watery diarrhea, dehydration, and high mortality rates in pigs. PEDV belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus of the family Coronaviridae. phylogenetic markers and powerful Bayesian phylogenetic approaches have been successfully applied to track the origin of important viral outbreaks. phylogenetic markers together with powerful Bayesian phylogenetic approaches have been successfully applied to track the origin of important viral outbreaks [13, 14] and establish molecular epidemiology links among different viral strains including coronavirus members. a clinical outbreak with epidemiological characteristics compatible with PEDV was reported in a pig farm in the province of Cotopaxi, Ecuador. a viral isolation was obtained and named PEDV/Cotopaxi/2014. a total of five fragments of ileum from three different diarrheic pigs were taken together with the viral isolate for total RNA isolation. amplicons were visualized in agarose gel and purified by Pure Link Kit Quick Gel Purification (Invitrogen) the resulting products were submitted to bidirectional DNA sequencing using BigDye Terminator cycling conditions by an external laboratory (Macrogen, Korea) amplification (fragment 4) 1409 S3627R CATCACCACCACAAAAACCA 24030\u201324011 56.73 DPS3045 F GGTGTTGTTGACGCTGAGAA 23448\u201323467 58.7 Amplification (fragment 5) 1377 DP4421R TGACAACTGTGTCAATCGTGT 24824\u201324804 58.1 426R GGCCAGCACAGTACCAAGTT 20829\u201320810 2.0 [34] was used to estimate the best-fit model using the Akaike (AIC) and Bayesian information criteria (BIC) the best-fit models for the complete S gene were selected. phylogenetic analyses were performed by Bayesian Inference (BI) and Neighbour-Joining (NJ) methodologies. a clinical outbreak with epidemiological characteristics compatible with PEDV was reported in a pig farm in the province of Cotopaxi, Ecuador. a viral isolation was obtained and named PEDV/Cotopaxi/2014. a total of five fragments of ileum from three different diarrheic pigs were taken together with the viral isolate PEDV/Cotopaxi/2014. the amplicons were visualized in agarose gel and purified by Pure Link Kit Quick Gel Purification (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. the resulting products were submitted to bidirectional DNA sequencing using BigDye Terminator cycling conditions. amplification (fragment 5) 1377 DP4421R TGACAACTGTGTCAATCGTGT 24824\u201324804 58.1 426R GGCCAGCACAGTACCAAGTT 20829\u201320810 58.7 Sequencing - 1220R TGAGCCTTCAGCAAGAATGA 21623\u201321604 60.54 Sequencing - 3045F GGTGTTGTTGACGCTGAGAA 23448\u201323467 a model of the S protein was kindly provided by professor Douglas Marthaler from department of Veterinary Population Medicine, University of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN, USA. a discrete phylogeographic analysis (DPA) was conducted using a standard continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) model with Bayesian stochastic search variable selection (BSSVS) to model the geographic transmission of PEDV. phylogenetic comparisons and Bayesian phylogeographic inference based on complete S gene sequences were conducted to track the origin and putative route of PEDV. the S gene of PEDV has more than 4000 nucleotides and encodes the S protein, which constitutes the spikes of the viral envelope, responsible for its high variability. sequence PEDV/Cotopaxi/2014 showed the changes 360SxG and 1203LxF compared with the sequence of PEDV isolate USA/Colorado/2013. these mutations were not located at the neutralizing epitopes (SS2, SS6, or 2C10) [37]. a mutation of serine in this domain could lead to an increase of the infectivity of the viral strains with this mutation. all algorithms yielded congruent results showing the same topologies. the tree yielded by BI was the best, but the statistical support for this tree was not significantly different from the NJ or ML trees. a short tree obtained from 60 PEDV strains showed the same distribution than the full tree. phylogeographic reconstruction identified a specific location for the root of the tree with posterior probabilities for state sp = 0.81 for the locality of China. the phylogeographic study revealed the emergence of the Chinese PEDV strains followed by spreading to US in 2013. the emergence of the PDEV strains in china is represented in panel (a), the arrival to us in 2013 is shown in panel (b) and the posterior distribution of the PEDV strains-like US is represented in panels (c) and (d). the emergence of the PDEV strains in china is represented in panel (a), the arrival to us in 2013 is shown in panel (b) and the posterior distribution of the PEDV strains-like US is represented in panels (c) and (d). a rigorous measurement of the global phylogeographic approach for PEDV strains was performed based on complete S gene sequences. the study provides evidences that PEDV strains are circulating into Ecuador swine herds. the spatial analyses suggested that these strains were introduced to Ecuador by an importation from US. conflicts of interest The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.
