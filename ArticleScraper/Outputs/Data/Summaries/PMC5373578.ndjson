{"summary": "all residents within this area (over 110,000 people) were evacuated. the evacuation order was issued with no advance warning. most local residents had no time to assemble their belongings to accompany them. the primary health issue reported for cats at animal shelters was upper respiratory infection (URI) URI is caused by feline herpesvirus-1 (FHV-1), feline calicivirus (FCV), Bordetella bronchiseptica, Chlamydophila felis, and Mycoplasma species. retrospective epidemiological evaluation of sheltered cats was performed at a temporary disaster shelter in Ihno, Fukushima prefecture, Japan. the incidences of URI and diarrhea were compared between the first and second years, and related to factors predictive of disease duration and frequency. data collection: Sex, intake date, vaccination date, location of capture, health status, and administered drugs were recorded. Statistical analysis Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and the log-rank test were used to determine whether the impounded year (2011 vs 2012) was associated with the incidence of URI and diarrhea development. retrospective cohort study was performed at a temporary disaster shelter in Ihno, Fukushima prefecture, Japan. between April 27th, 2011 to December 31st, 2012, 189 cats brought by animal control officers from the restricted area were included. ninety five cats were impounded during 2011, and 94 cats were impounded during 2012. cox proportional hazards regression models were used to assess the association between potential risk factors and the count of temporally independent URI events. log-rank test was used to determine whether the impounded year (2011 vs 2012) was associated with the incidence of URI and diarrhea development. one hundred and forty-eight cats were rescued from the restricted zone by the prefecture government in 2011. 95 (52 females, 36 males, and seven of unknown sex) were admitted to the Ihno shelter in 2011, and 53 were transferred to animal hospitals or government shelters in other prefectures. the 2011 incidence of diarrhea in cats was highest between one and two weeks after entering the shelter, with up to nine cases per week. in 2012 the first peak was observed in week 5 with up to six new cases per week, and declined to one new case per week. the median duration (range) the cats presented the URI signs was 15.5 (1\u2013174) days and 8 (1\u2013110) days in 2011 and 2012, respectively. curves are significantly different (p = 0.001). X-axis; Days at shelter. Y-axis; Probability free of diarrhea. Approximately 96% of cats (91 of 95) either showed signs of URI or diarrhea in 2011 and approximately 80% of cats (75 of 94) in 2012 had both URI and diarrhea. in 2011, odds ratio that cats acquired both URI and diarrhea was higher than 2012. in 2012, 75% of cats were given less than four drugs. interferon was given to 66% of the cats (52 of 79) to treat URI in 2011. median duration of medication administration per cat was 11 (1\u201352) days. 5, 95% CI = 1.19\u20135.49, p = 0.016), chlorpheniramine (OR = 4.32, 95% CI = 1.94\u20139.60, p 0.001), enrofloxacin (OR = 2.31, 95% CI = 0.96\u20135.56, p = 0.063), cefovecin (OR = 2.65, 95% CI = 1.00\u20136.97, p = 0.049), prednisone 1.00 2 weeks (n = 19) 0.37 0.22\u20130.65 0.001 3 weeks (n = 9) 0.24 0.10\u20130.54 0.001 4 weeks (n = 9) 0.25 0.12\u20130.53 0.001 Antihistamine (n = 113) 0.45 0.30\u20130.68 0.001 Chlorpheniramine (n = 113) 0.36 0.23\u20130.56 0.001 Multivariable model (n = 89) Number of antibiotics 1 1.00 2 0.61 0.001 Parturition (n = 99) 0.42 0.26\u20130.68 0.001 Number of drugs (n = 153) 1 to 4 (n = 92) 1.00 5 to 8 (n = 42) 2.64 1.86\u20133.75 0.001 9 or more (n = 19) 5.41 3.67\u20137.97 0.001 Number of antibiotics (n = 122) 1 (n = 59) 1.00 2 (n = 33) 1.22 0.84\u20131.76 0.299 3 or one hundred and forty-eight cats were rescued from the restricted zone by the prefecture government in 2011. of these, 95 (52 females, 36 males, and seven of unknown sex) were admitted to the Ihno shelter in 2012. until first vaccination was 2 (range = 1\u201367) days and the median time until the second vaccination was 81 (range = 3\u2013117) days in 2011. in 2012, all cats were vaccinated within 48 hours of intake with the same inactivated vaccines. no records were kept for second vaccinations. disease Incident diarrhea was observed in approximately 71% of cats in 2011 and 54% of the cats in 2012. the 2011 incidence of diarrhea in cats was highest between one and two weeks after entering the shelter, with up to nine cases per week. median days (range) to develop clinical signs of diarrhea following intake was 30 (1\u2013136) days in 2011 and 59 (1\u2013189) days in 2012. Approximately 26 of 79 cats that developed URI (33%) and 15 of 74 (20%) cats that developed URI in 2011 and 2012 had relapse of URI events. curves are significantly different (p = 0.001). antibiotics were given to 67.4% of cats (64 of 95) in 2011. half the cats were administered five to eight drugs, and 20% received more than nine drugs. in 2012, 75% of cats were given less than four drugs. Medications associated with relapse of URI were steroids (OR = 3.10, 95% CI = 1.44\u20136.68, p = 0.004), antihistamines (OR = 2.55, 95% CI = 1.19\u20135.49, p = 0.016), chlorpheniramine (OR = 4.32, 95% CI = 1.94\u20139.60, p 0.001), enrofloxacin (OR = 2.31, 95% CI = 0.96\u2013 0.48 0.21\u20131.09 0.08 Number of antibiotics (n = 101) 1 (n = 44) 1.00 2 (n = 29) 0.38 0.23\u20130.64 0.001 3 or more (n = 28) 0.25 0.15\u20130.44 0.001 Number of drugs (n = 105) 1 to 4 (n = 53) 1.00 5 to 8 (n = 34) 0.38 0.24\u20130.61 0.001 9 or more (n = 18) 0.20 0.11\u20130.39 0.00 n = 118) 0.29 0.087\u20130.96 0.043 Enrofloxacin (n = 113) 0.55 0.30\u20131.00 0.051 Scopolamine butylbromide (n = 113) 0.38 0.18\u20130.80 0.011 Berberine (n = 113) 0.44 0.20\u20130.95 0.037 Table 4. Univariable and multivariable Poisson regression model and incidence rate ratio (IRR) of the frequency of URI. twenty-four different medications were used for treating URI in 2011 including five types of antihistamines, 13 types of antibiotics, two kinds of steroids. Medicating with more than five drugs in the same patient was not a high priority; sheltering was hence established in a disorganized manner. the most common causative agents responsible for URI in shelters are FHV-1, FCV, Mycoplasma species, Bordetella bronchiseptica, and Chlamydophila felis. more than 60% of the cats were treated with antihistamines, the majority with chlorpheniramine. the use of antihistamines in cats to treat URI is not typically considered to be an appropriate treatment. interferon administered to 66% of cats with URI in this study. there is no evidence to date supporting its effectiveness for treatment of clinical signs of URI. virulent systemic FCV disease has not been reported in Japan. the most common first choices of antibiotic used in shelters are doxycycline (52%), amocixillin/clavulanic acid (33%), and azithromycin (7%)[27]. multiple agents are involved in URI, and each causative agent has different susceptibility to the antibiotics. tranexamic acid, antibiotics, antidiarrheals, anthelmintics, antiflatulents, interferon, antimuscarinics, anticholinergics, berberine, metoclopramide, corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories. twenty-three different drugs were administered to treat diarrhea. ylobacter, Giardia, Cryptosporidium, hookworms, and ascarids are pathogens with zoonotic potential. the majority of bacterial enteropathogens are associated with self-limiting disease. antibiotic therapy can potentially alter microbiota, cause gut bacterial overgrowth[34] and deregulate defense against viruses. indiscriminately treating the cats was ineffective, and reducing environmental stress is a more important management strategy for controlling disease outbreaks. the incidence proportion of diarrhea and URI in cats at Ihno shelter was high. rese exposing cats to less environmental noise, reducing population density, and providing consistent care by trained personnel. avoid using corticosteroids, interferon, antihistamines, or multiple antibiotics."}
