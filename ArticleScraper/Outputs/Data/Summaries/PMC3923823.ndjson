{"summary": "influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) varies between countries because of the difference in the circulating strains and population characteristics [1] for effective control of influenza, country-specific influenza VE must be monitored every season [3], [4]. test-negative case-control study design has been widely used to estimate influenza VE. a prospective case-control study was conducted at a middle-sized community hospital in the city, which was the study site used in our previous influenza VE study during the 2010\u20132011 season. none of the influenza VE estimates in the 2011\u20132012 season have been reported from Asian countries, including Japan. a case was excluded if the hospital did not have a paediatric department. a standardised questionnaire was distributed to all outpatients during the study period. patients were considered \u201cvaccinated\u201d only if they had been vaccinated more than 14 days prior to the hospital visit. the vaccines for use in the 2011\u20132012 northern hemisphere influenza season contain A/California/7/2009(H1N1)-like, A/Perth/16/2009(H3N2)-like, and B/Brisbane/60/2008-like strains. the world health organization recommended that the vaccines for use in the 2011\u20132012 northern hemisphere influenza season contain A/California/7/2009(H1N1)-like, PCR results but not RIDT results were used to define laboratory-confirmed influenza cases. the phylogenetic tree was constructed using the Neighbor-Joining method. HA1 sequences from reference strains used in the phylogenetic analysis were obtained from the EpiFlu database of the global initiative on sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) sensitivity and specificity of RIDT for detecting influenza were assessed. all statistical analyses were performed using STATA 11.2 (STATA Corp., USA) testing was performed more than five days after disease onset, 3) testing was performed within seven days after previous testing, 4) the clinical sample was lost, or 5) it presented before the week of the first PCR-confirmed influenza case. the study period was from December 1, 2011 through April 30, 2012. the world health organization recommended that the vaccines for use in the 2011\u20132012 northern hemisphere influenza season contain A/California/7/2009(H1N1)-like, A/Perth/16/2009(H3N2)-like, and B/Brisbane/60/2008-like strains [13]. Virus Characterisation Viral nucleic acid was extracted using a QIA viral RNA minikit. the phylogenetic tree was constructed using the Neighbor-Joining method. HA1 sequences from reference strains used in the phylogenetic analysis were obtained from the EpiFlu database of the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID). data analysis Patients were categorised into three groups: ILI episodes that were positive for influenza A and B (influenza positive cases), negative for influenza and positive for non-influenza respiratory viruses (NIRV all statistical analyses were performed using STATA 11.2 (STATA Corp., USA) results Between December 2011 and April 2012, 444 ILI episodes were enrolled in the study. 78 (25.2%) were single-positive for influenza A, 37 (12%) were single-positive for influenza B and one (0.3%) was positive for both influenza A and B. 58.2% of all influenza A-positive samples were positive for the H3N2 strain. all unsubtyped influenza A samples were negative for the H3N2 strain. HRV was the leading virus identified, followed by RSV. unadjusted estimate of influenza VE against medically attended, laboratory-confirmed influenza was 18.3% (95% confidence interval: 34.4 to 50.3) based on the use of all influenza-negative controls. unadjusted and adjusted VE estimates were 26.7% (95% CI: 28.1 to 58.1) and 16% (95% CI: 54.5 to 54.3) 5% CI: 67.5 to 63.4) in the early phase (week 1 to week 8) and 8.9% (95% CI: 155.7 to 67.5) in the late phase (week 9 to week 17) similar patterns were observed in the estimates of VE against medically attended influenza. sensitivity and specificity of RIDT for detecting influenza A and/or B were 78.6% (95% CI: 73.9 to 83) and 95.3% (95% CI: 93 to 97.7) respectively. in total, 23 H3N2 viruses were characterised by phylogenetic analysis of the HA1 sequence. a significant proportion of circulating viruses showed reduced reactivity against A/Perth/16/2009, the vaccine virus used for the 2011\u20132012 northern hemisphere seasons. in the UK, VE against influenza A(H3N2) decreased from 43% in the early phase (Oct 2011\u2013Jan 2012) to 17% in the late phase (Feb 2012\u2013Apr 2012) [4]. the low VE in Japan may be explained by the combination of the vaccine strain mismatch and the waning of protection, as is the case in Europe. the point estimate was highest when we used all influenza-negative controls and RV-negative controls. this finding was consistent with the hypothesis recently proposed by Cowling et al. this study design allows for the collection of appropriate controls that are drawn from the same source population as the cases. if the risk of NIRV infection is high among the people vaccinated for influenza, the inclusion of NIRV-positive cases in the test-negative control group overestimates the true VE. the influenza VE was limited in Japan during the 2011\u20132012 season. the vaccine strain mismatch and the waning of protection may explain the low VE. further investigations are warranted to identify an appropriate control group in this study design. 71% of subtyped strains were A(H3N2), 0.2% were A(H1N1)pdm09, and 28% were B based on the national surveillance of this season [14]. HI assays using post-infection ferret antiserum raised against the vaccine virus recommended for the 2011\u20132012 influenza vaccine, A/Victoria/210/2009(H3N2) showed that 34% of the test viruses had a reduction in HI titre of eight-fold ling et al conducted a randomised controlled trial and demonstrated that TIV recipients had an increased risk of NIRV infections. if the hypothesis is true, NIRV-positive cases are more likely to have been vaccinated for influenza. a supporting finding was reported in australia; specifically, Kelly et al conducted a test-negative case-control study on children. the test-negative case-control study using RIDT provides rapid estimates of influenza VE in clinical settings. the influenza VE estimate using RIDT results (adjusted VE = 5.2%) was almost identical to that using PCR results (adjusted VE = 5.3%)"}
