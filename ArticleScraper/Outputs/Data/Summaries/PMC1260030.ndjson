{"summary": "the two common types of chronic viral hepatitis (CVH), hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) are major causes of death and morbidity. conservative estimates suggest 400 million people are persistently infected with HBV, while HCV may infect a further 200 million. in excess of two million people will die from cirrhosis or liver cancer caused by CVH. this genetic variability causes near-infinite antigenic heterogeneity, facilitating viral evasion of host defences. RNA polymerases probably cause more morbidity and premature mortality in man, and other animals. there is no argument for HBV, and other viruses, high affinity antibody will prevent HBV infection. acute HCV or HIV infection results in life-long viral persistence. many patients develop immunological responses, including specific antibody and CTL reactivity to various viral antigens. however, these responses have little discernible impact on either HCV or HIV replication that occurs unchecked. the first part of this paper explores the impact of RNApol fidelity on quasispecies behaviour. we suggest the primary event causing reduction in viral replication is inhibition of RNApol processivity by variant viral proteins, specifically envelope and envelope-related proteins. we also suggest immune responses are thwarted initially by broad antigenic diversity generated by low RNApol fidelity but develop when they do. 40 million people have become infected worldwide and each year about a million die from resulting immunodeficiency and consequent opportunistic infections. poor countries bear a disproportionate burden of disease caused by these viruses that further exacerbate poverty through pervasive economic disruption. emerging viral pathogens including WNV, the SARS coronavirus, endemic viruses like Murray Valley, Japanese, and other encephalitis viruses, dengue and yellow fever, and seasonal influenza, hepatitis despite global epidemiology, the immune system is thought to \"control\" viruses. there is no argument for HBV, and other viruses, high affinity antibody will prevent HBV infection. most patients develop neutralizing antibodies, clear HBsAg from serum, and normalize liver function long term. evidence that prior HCV infection confers no protective immunity against heterologous HCV infection in humans [9] or chimpanzees [10] or against either homotypic [11] or heterotypic [12] human reinfection. strong specific CD4/CD8 immune responses with T-helper (TH1) cytokine profiles are found more frequently in patients with self limiting viral infections than those who develop chronic viral carriage [18,19] immune responses to viruses are thwarted initially by broad antigenic diversity generated by low RNApol fidelity but develop after viral replication falls. polymerase fidelity increases \u2013 linked events that occur because of replicative homeostasis. we further suggest immune responses strategically exploit replicative homeostasis to force viruses to reveal critical antigenic epitopes. fluctuating transaminase elevation \u2013 mirroring fluctuating viraemia in HCV infection \u2013 often persists indefinitely. if immune functions are responsible for falling viral replication seen between point A to point B, then the immunological clearance forces at point A must exceed the viral expansive forces. there is no evidence this occurs, and very considerable evidence that immune force(s) are increasing during this time [29] (observation 2, proposition 4) and (observation 2, proposition 4) are self-contradictory and incompatible with the conclusive belief that immune responses cause HCV replication to fall. adaptive immune responses to HCV are completely undetectable for at least 7\u201310 weeks after infection. despite high level viral replication, adaptive cellular immune responses to HCV are completely undetectable for at least 7\u201310 weeks [33] after infection. adaptive immune responses to HCV are completely undetectable for at least 7\u201310 weeks after infection. adaptive immune responses do not develop in the first 6\u20137 weeks of HCV infection simply because the virus isn't \"seen\" cDNA assay (bDNA) or quantitative PCR (qPCR) uses probes or primers complementary to conserved 5'untranslated (5'UTR) HCV RNA sequences. RNA transcription may prematurely terminate making 5'UTR RNAs relatively more prevalent than EeRNAs. ii) HCV 5'UTR is highly conserved, while EeRNA s are less constrained. ii) hybridization efficiencies of PCR primers or bDNA probes greater for 5'UTR RNAs than for the population of EeRNAs. there is no evidence this occurs, and very considerable evidence that immune force(s) are increasing during this time [29] (observation 2, proposition 4) and (observation 2, proposition 4) are self-contradictory and incompatible with the conclusive belief that immune responses cause HCV replication to fall. adaptive immune responses to HCV are undetectable for at least 7\u201310 weeks after infection. adaptive immune responses to HCV are completely undetectable for at least 7\u201310 weeks after infection. the adaptive response seems to really ignore for several weeks a substantial quantity of virus. adaptive immune responses do not develop in the first 6\u20137 weeks of HCV infection. it is more likely that adaptive cellular or humoral immune responses do not develop in the first 6\u20137 weeks of HCV infection simply because the virus isn't \"seen\" RNA transcription may prematurely terminate making 5'UTR RNAs relatively more prevalent than EeRNAs and ii) HCV 5'UTR is highly conserved, while EeRNA s are less constrained, making hybridization efficiencies greater for 5'UTR RNAs than for the population of EeRNAs, causing relative under-estimation of true envelope RNA concentration. mutations will develop at each genomic locus 107 times/day. probability any two genomes synthesized consecutively will be identical is about 10-6. progressive dilution of wild-type genomes act together to prevent RNA quasispecies extinction. mutations that create new or obliterate pre-existing, start or stop codons in a significant proportion of RNAs will cause translation of highly unusual and heterogeneous proteins. the probability of any particular sequence arising will fall dramatically with increasing genetic distance from that consensus sequence. a zone of'reagent specificity' may be defined encompassing wild type and some variant sequences. there will be some RNA sequences and corresponding proteins of any quasispecies undetectable with these sequence-specific reagents. the 5'UTR concentration corresponds to the area under the frequency distribution curve. two-dimensional representation of hyperdimensional RNA frequency distribution curve (scale arbitrary) with conceptual centre of gravity of replication (wild type, green) and variant sequences (blue), zone of reagent specificity (red shading) and threshold of detection (TOD) of any assay. probability of any particular sequence arising will fall dramatically with increasing

variations confer to individual birds. if a species is widely distributed in space, but population mixing is slow or incomplete, locally prevalent interactions with other species will vary. regional genetic variations will arise and be maintained, hence progressive divergence from the original genotype (speciation) may result. if alteration of RNApol fidelity causes synthesis of either wild-type or variant RNA sequences that then interact with RNApol. alteration of both processivity and fidelity of RNApol results, permitting viruses to adaptively respond to environmental changes. equilibria develop as a result of RNApol/envelope interactions and viral autoregulation. cell-surface protein polymorphisms are strongly selected for, and have been highly conserved over deep time. polymorphisms are found in all organisms from primitive prokaryotic cells [51] and thermophilic bacteria [52] through to plants [53] as well as mammalian cells. the lock and key hypothesis contends polymorphisms arise, and are maintained, as protection against cellular parasitism, particularly by viruses2. enzymes acting in a milieu of increasing concentrations of inhibitory molecules become less processive until reduced enzyme output is insufficient to further inhibit enzyme activity. if alteration of RNApol fidelity causes synthesis of either wild-type or variant RNA sequences. if alteration of RNApol fidelity causes synthesis of either wild-type or variant RNA sequences that then interact with RNApol. development of cell-surface protein polymorphisms is an obvious adaptive strategy to thwart invasion by primitive viruses. polymorphisms are strongly selected for, and have been highly conserved over deep time. the lock and key hypothesis contends polymorphisms arise, and are maintained, as protection against cellular parasitism. a typical clinical serum sample, containing 4 105 geq/ml HCV and mutating at 10-5 substitutions/base, will contain examples of each possible nucleotide at every locus. most variations will remain undetected during sequencing or any other method of quasispecies analysis. replicative homeostasis may suggest a solution for rates of intracellular viral replication and mutation. high affinity wild-type envelope:polymerase interactions predominate. RNApol infidelity ensures synthesis of variant viral RNAs and proteins predominates early. variant protein molecules progressively accumulate within cells relative to wild-type viral molecules. affinity responses further deplete intracellular concentrations of wild-type proteins, greatly reducing RNApol processivity to the point of viral latency (E,e) in a newly infected cell, high-affinity wild-type:RNApol interactions will predominate resulting in high RNApol processivity but low fidelity causing high-level viraemia with broad virus phenotypic spectrum. variant viral envelope: RNApol interactions increase, RNApol fidelity increases. processivity decreases, restricting the distribution of viral RNA and proteins. hepatitis C \"early replication\" paradox resolves completely when considered in context of replicative homeostasis. the transaminase peak would not be expected until after viral replication falls due to autoinhibition of RNApol processivity. this mechanism of immune avoidance might also explain maternal-foetal tolerance. the human foetus maintains a stable parasitic existence. autoimmunity arises from \"inability to distinguish self from non-self\" hepatitis C \u2013 and its treatment with interferon \u2013 is associated with many varied autoimmune phenomena. rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies, anticardiolipin, antithyroid, anti-liver/kidney/microsomal antibodies are common accompaniments of chronic HCV infection [73] biology suggests a solution to the problem of viral autoimmunity and autoimmunity in general. aetiologies include inflammatory components, such as coronary artery disease. aetiologies include lectins, hormone receptors and cell signaling molecules. viruses are capable of generating highly plastic ligands with very broad receptor affinities. if a virus co-opts a receptor for cell entry then wild-type envelope epitopes will probably form the common viral ligand. if a virus co-opts a receptor for cell entry, then wild-type envelope epitopes will probably form the common viral ligand. a virus enters cells because wild-type envelope motifs interact with insulin, insulin receptor substrate [79,80], TSH or related molecules [83], or acetylcholine [76] receptors. many variant envelope polypeptides, generated by envelope ORF quasispecies RNAs, would have similar receptor binding affinity, but could effectively disrupt receptor function. obstructive sleep apnoea [103] and myocardial infarction [104]. polymorphisms of the leptin gene are associated with insulin resistance [105] and long-term risk of developing diabetes mellitus [102] cardiovascular disease, leading cause of premature death and disability in most western countries, has a well-established multi-factorial basis. complex interplay between genetic predisposition, environmental and personal risk factors \u2013 including systemic hypertension, diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidaemia. systemic hypertension, diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidaemia have long-established, but complex patterns of inheritance. confluence of established risk factors for coronary artery disease, including genetic susceptibility, polymorphisms predisposing to hypertension [126-128], diabetes [126] and hypercholesterolaemia. new data implicating vascular inflammation [119,129], endothelial dysfunction [119,130], leptin dysregulation [104] and viral infection [131,132] in pathogenesis of vascular disease. if statins compete with variant viral proteins for H highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has reduced the incidence of HIV-D by 40\u201350%. direct cytopathic effects of HIV or other viruses are unlikely. active replication of virus, high-level viral protein expression and increased viral envelope sequence-diversity in blood and brain are all important. cognitive abnormalities found in patients with early HCV and HIV infection are unsurprising. viral quasispecies biology predicts VRD will have other characteristics. if wild-type proteins are dominantly agonist in function with respect to their receptor, variant proteins will predominantly exhibit antagonist function. a corollary of fluctuating phenotypic dominance of viral protein quasispecies is that receptor affinity of these proteins will also fluctuate. a corollary of fluctuating phenotypic dominance of viral protein quasispecies is that receptor affinity of these proteins will also fluctuate, and any resulting inflammation may vary in both intensity and anatomical distribution over time. if confirmed, the well-documented seasonality of some depressive illnesses [158] and schizophrenia, [146] and increased rates of schizophrenia during influenza epidemics [144,145] may be more rationally explained. if quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays of both 5'UTR and envelope RNAs are performed serially, then a numerical expression describing changing quasispecies complexity over time may be obtained. professors Mike McCall, Dick Joske, Bill Reed, Bill Musk, Peter Pullan, Michael Quinlan, Dick Lefroy and Ted Haywood have turned back-of-envelope sketches into first-class graphics."}
