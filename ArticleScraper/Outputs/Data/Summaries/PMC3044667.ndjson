{"summary": "few epidemiological studies have been published based solely on DFA. none included respiratory picornaviruses and human metapneumovirus. we wished to evaluate the use of DFA for epidemiological studies. the most commonly used diagnostic methods for virus detection are culture, rapid culture, direct immunofluorescence staining of clinical specimens and PCR. PCR is attractive due to its high sensitivity and broad range of virus detection. a significant proportion of asymptomatic children test positive by PCR to respiratory viruses [14-16], and picornavirus RNA can be detected by PCR up to 5 weeks after an acute infection. no commercial antibodies for the detection of respiratory picornaviruses or hMPV included testing for respiratory picornaviruses. prospective DFA testing in nasopharyngeal aspirates has been used routinely in this institution. direct immunofluorescence testing (DFA) for respiratory viruses. results of samples from same patient taken within a time period of 7 days. results of samples from same patient taken within a time period of 7 days. a cut-off of p 0.05, two tailed, was used for all statistical analyses. a total of 12'189 respiratory samples were collected. 10'629 samples remained for the retrospective analysis of DFA results. the D3 Ultra DFA Respiratory Virus Screening & ID Kit (Diagnostic Hybrids) was used for the same viruses. starting in march 2006, the Light Diagnostics Pan-Enterovirus Reagent \"Blend\" was introduced for the detection of picornaviruses. the addition of DFA for picornaviruses increased the positivity rate. the positivity rate after 2006 was on average 65% in winter and 52% in summer, with a yearly average of 58%. 57 from the 78 additional positive results were respiratory picornaviruses. 3 4 6 3 2 2 3 4 4 hMPV 0.2 4 1 8 3 Picorna 2 24 26 33 28 27 An epidemiological year lasts from May 1st to April 30th of the following year ADV = adenovirus; RSV = respiratory syncytial virus; IFA = influenza A; IFB = influenza B; parainfluenza viruses 1-3. hMPV was detected in 3.4% of all samples collected after November 2006. it caused yearly winter epidemics, except during the winter season 2005-2006. hMPV activity varied from being almost absent during the winter season 2006 to 2007. number of nasopharyngeal aspirates with viral codetections by DFA picorna hMPV PIV IFB IFA RSV ADV 9 2 4 0 2 10 RSV 29 0 0 1 7 IFA 1 0 4 PIV 9 1 hMPV 3 ADV = adenovirus; IFB = influenza B; parainfluenza viruses 1-3. in 0.8% of samples we detected three respiratory viruses. the median age of the study population was 11 months (range 0-17 years) and 57.5% were boys. the rate of viral detection was dominated by the RSV season. respiratory picornaviruses were the most common pathogens detected overall in our study population. they were present year round, with peaks in the spring and the fall. this was the only time during the year when respiratory picornaviruses were not the most common respiratory virus. opharyngeal aspirates from hospitalized children between may 1998 and April 2010, with introduction of the hMPV and respiratory picornavirus assays in 2006. hMPV was detected in 3.4% of all samples collected after November 2006. hMPV activity surpassed previous years, with more cases observed within 5 months. SV, p 0.0001; 5-8 years: 26% versus 7% other viruses, p 0.0001; 9-17 years: 16% versus 9% influenza A, p = 0.007) and RSV was the most common detected in children 1 year (30% versus 23% picornavirus, p 0.0001) xTag Respiratory Viral Panel (Luminex) 10.2% of samples were positive for two viruses. in 0.8% of samples we detected three respiratory viruses. PCR detection of respiratory picornaviruses suggests a previously unexpected role in severe respiratory disease. more than one virus was detected in 11% of samples. in 81% of these a respiratory picornavirus was present. hMPV has a biennial \"large-early\" and \"small-late\" season cycle. clinical relevance, flexibility and capacity to conduct \"multiplex\" assays at very low cost make it a valuable diagnostic tool. this allows for long-term, systematic, real-time monitoring of local epidemiology. authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
