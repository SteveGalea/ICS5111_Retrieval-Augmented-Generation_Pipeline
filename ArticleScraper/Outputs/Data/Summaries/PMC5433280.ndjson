{"summary": "155 throat swabs were collected from equal number of children suspected to have SARI. multiplex real-time RT-PCR helped in rapid identification of viruses. seventeen viruses were detected in SARI cases with overall positivity of 72.9 per cent. a total of 155 throat swab samples were collected from equal number of consecutive patients with SARI using a sterile nylon flocked swabs. a total of 155 samples were collected from equal number of consecutive patients with SARI using a sterile nylon flocked swabs. BI7500 Fast used 1 l AgPath-IDTM One-Step RT-PCR kit (Ambion, USA), 12.5 l assay buffer and 1.5 l primer probe mix (5 sets) of FTD respiratory pathogens 21 kit (Fast-track Diagnosis, Luxembourg) for the detection of (18 viruses, two subtypes RSV A & B, HMPV A & B and Mycoplasma pneumoniae) influenza A, influenza A (H1 no human parechovirus (HPeV) was identified in the study. four samples (2.6%) were found to be positive for bacterial agent Mycoplasma pneumoniae. in cases presenting with fever and cough followed by influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 as compared to other viruses in the study. 68 (50%) in three to six days of illness and 12 (8.8%) in samples collected after more than six days of illness. HCOV HKU1, human coronavirus HKU1; HCOV OC43, human coronavirus OC43; HCOV NL63, human coronavirus COR 229E; HPIV-1, human parainfluenza virus 1; HPIV-2, human parainfluenza virus 2; HPIV-3, human parainfluenza virus 3; HPIV-4, human parainfluenza virus 4; EV, enterovirus; HBOV, human influenza A (H1N1)pdm09, HRV, HAdV, RSV, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43 were found to be more in females than in males. the predominant isolate in the present study was found to be HMPV with 25.7% of children showing positivity. the presence of RSV in the present study was found to be low (4.41%) compared with other studies reporting 13.1-21.3 per cent2,20 in patients with different degrees of respiratory illness and acute LRI. the reason might be due to low number of children enrolled in the age group of 0-12 months. use of throat swab only for collecting samples might have limited the detection of RSV. most of the respiratory viruses were found in the age group 49-60 months followed by 25-36 months old children. similar findings have been made previously with predominant infections in the children of less than five years21. the distribution of respiratory viruses in males was found to be higher as compared to females. detailed clinical work up for better clinico-virological correlation. follow up bacterial culture to understand role of secondary bacterial infection."}
