{"summary": "RNA virus replication is characterized by a high mutation rate. this diversity can be utilized by the virus to evade and escape the immune system. maintaining the correct amount of virus diversity of 1 mutation per genome is of utmost importance to RNA virus survival within the host. fidelity mutants have similar growth kinetics in vivo, but are attenuated in vivo due to the alteration of diversity produced during replication. the alphavirus genus, family Togaviridae, contains a number of important arboviruses that are distributed worldwide. equine encephalitis virus is a new world encephalitic alphavirus. it circulates continuously in an enzootic cycle in the forests and swamps of northern South America, Central America and Mexico. the virus emerges to cause epizootic cycles in equids, which can also spill over into humans. reliance of TC-83 on only two point mutations for its attenuation increases the potential for reversion during vaccination, as well as instability during manufacturing. reliance of TC-83 on only two point mutations for its attenuation increases the potential for reversion during vaccination. rate is also hypothesized to decrease the ability of the virus to successfully revert or pseudorevert through Muller\u2019s ratchet. deletions can also impair the ability of fitter viruses to replicate and increase in the population. RNA virus error rate is finely tuned to allow for optimal virus population health while also allowing for the production of mutations. three mutations were identified in both 5FU passages. all were located in the 5\u2019 end of the RdRp gene (nsP4). all were located in the 5\u2019 end of the RdRp gene. resistance of TC-83 mutants to treatment by 5FU (D) cells were treated with 0, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200 or 300 g/ml of 5FU. all experiments were performed in triplicate. titers for all single RdRp mutants dropped compared with parent TC-83. treatment with higher 5FU concentrations caused titers to drop. titers were significantly reduced compared with parent TC-83. TC-83 and the RdRp mutants were exposed to various concentrations of Ribavirin. no significant difference was observed, except for the G14R mutant. individual TC-83 mutants were injected intracranially into 6-day-old CD-1 mice. s were injected subcutaneously into 6-day-old CD-1 mice to measure their ability to cause mortality. TC-83 3x and TC-83 4x exhibited significantly reduced mortality. the remaining mutants caused similar mortality to original TC-83. mutation frequency analysis of TC-83, 3x and 4x after 1 passage on vero, HEK-293, C7/10 or U4.4 cells. TC-83 3x and 4x only appear to be resistant to one nucleoside analog. parent TC-83 and TC-83 4x produced diversity hotspots in E1. TC-83 3x appeared to have an increased number of diversity hotspots in C7/10 cells. a representative replicate is pictured for each virus isolate from each cell type. adult CD-1 mice, 7 weeks of age, were vaccinated with 5 log10 PFU in a 50ul volume via the subcutaneous route. animals were bled on days 1\u20133 after vaccination and weighed daily for 1 week and then again on days 11 and 14. animals showed no weight loss and viremia was sporadic with no significant differences among any of the viruses. the effectiveness of the vaccine was determined by neutralizing antibody titer using serum from 6-week post-vaccination (B) mice were challenged with 105 PFU of VEEV strain 3908 and were monitored for percent weight change from the original weight at D0 (C) and survival (D). inoculum backtiters ranged from 3.5 104 to 1.1 105 PFU per dose. inoculum backtiters ranged from 3.5 104 to 1.1 105 PFU per dose. inoculum backtiters ranged from 4.8 to 8.8 104 PFU per dose. TC-83, TC-83 3x and TC-83 4x were subjected to five passages in vero cells. Sanger sequencing of the RdRp revealed no mutations. the 3x and 4x mutants and TC-83 were also subjected to 10 serial intracranial passages in infant mice. -83, 3x or 4x from infant mouse intracranial passages (A) differences were determined using Kaplan-Meier tests. mutation frequency of the E2 8922 mutation required for TC-83 attenuation. TC-83 and TC-83 3x each produced two SNPs following 10 passages. TC-83 and TC-83 4x each produced two SNPs. no consensus sequence changes were found in all passage series. 2.2 Cloning of TC-83 mutants The three mutations identified following the 5FU passages were cloned into the TC-83 backbone in conjunction with a high fidelity mutation. a 3x mutant including G14R, E37G and A96T and a 4x mutant including G14R, E37G, A96T and C488Y. all experiments were performed in triplicate. Statistical differences were determined by repeated measures ANOVA. no significant differences were observed between the mutants and their parent. treatment with higher 5FU concentrations caused titers for all single RdRp mutants to drop compared with parent TC-83. titers were significantly reduced compared with parent TC-83 when cells were treated with 100\u2013300 g/ml. individual TC-83 mutants were injected intracranially into 6-day-old CD-1 mice at a titer of ca. 5 log10 PFU. the TC-83 3x mutant was significantly more virulent than the parent virus, with all animals succumbing by Day 2 compared with TC-83. TC-83 3x and 4x were the only RdRp mutants chosen for this analysis. they were most likely to have altered fidelity as measured by a preliminary Illumina sequencing analysis. the 3x mutant produced a significantly higher amount of genetic diversity than parental TC-83. TC-83 3x and 4x only appear to be resistant to one nucleoside analog. parent TC-83 and TC-83 4x both produced diversity hotspots in E1. TC-83 3x appeared to have an increased number of diversity hotspots in C7/10 cells than the other cell types. TC-83 3x appeared to have an increased number of diversity hotspots in C7/10 cells. a representative replicate is pictured for each virus isolate from each cell type. five-week-old mice were injected with 105 PFU of TC-83, 3x, 4x or mock in a 50ul volume (n = 8 per vaccine treatment) mice were challenged with 105 PFU of TC-83, 3x, 4x or mock in a 50ul volume. VEEV strain 3908 was monitored for percent weight change from the original weight at D0 (C) and survival (D). viremia titers following vaccination with TC-83, TC-83 3x, TC-83 4x or mock were monitored for percent weight change from the original weight at D0 (C) and survival (D). R1 denotes replicate 1. R2 denotes replicate 2. Statistical differences were determined using Kaplan-Meier tests. intracranial survival curves were similar to those in Fig. 2A. x were subjected to five passages in vero cells. the 3x and 4x mutants and TC-83 were also subjected to 10 serial intracranial passages in infant mice. TC-83, TC-83 3x and TC-83 4x all gained virulence by passage 5 compared with their unpassaged counterparts. TC-83 3x and 4x were producing more diversity than the parent TC-83. fewer revertents occurred at the mutation required for TC-83 attenuation. TC-83 3x and 4x were producing more diversity. TC-83 and TC-83 3x each produced two SNPs following 10 passages. TC-83 and TC-83 4x each produced two SNPs following 10 passages. there were no consensus sequence changes found in all passage series. fidelity mutants have only been generated using wt virus strains. fidelity mutants are unlikely to be sufficiently attenuated for vaccine use. low-fidelity mutants have been isolated by mutating residues found to alter fidelity in other viruses or by passingaging virus in the presence of a nucleoside analog. these mutants exhibit higher fidelity for the specific mutations selected by the nucleoside analog, but not ribavirin. TC-83 3x mutant showed no significant difference in virus diversity compared with TC-83 parent after one cell culture passage. however, TC-83 4x may actually be a low-fidelity variant. a combination of these two hypotheses might explain the observed results. TC-83 exhibited low-fidelity features when a low-fidelity CHIKV mutation was inserted. the effects did not transfer to TC-83 even though the residue is highly conserved among alphaviruses. no increased hotspots were observed for U4.4 cells, which do produce antiviral siRNAs. further work is needed to determine how these hotspots correspond to small RNA targeting in mosquito cells and examine the effects of the host immune response on virus populations. mutants exhibit decreased risk of reversion to wt virulence compared with TC-83. mutants were put through a standard challenge model previously used for different VEEV vaccines. the mutants induced higher antibody titers than TC-83. the presence of low-fidelity mutations in a LAV resulted in reduced virulence in an infant mouse model and increased immunogenicity in an adult mouse model. however, we also observed different outcomes in low-fidelity mutant attenuation in vivo when different pools of virus stock were used. this suggests that the virus population stabilizes after multiple growth cycles, so low-fidelity RNA virus vaccines may require passaging. 7/10 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% minimal essential medium Non-essential amino acids, 1% trypose phosphate broth and Pen/Strep (100 U/ml) in a 30\u00b0C CO2 incubator. Viruses were rescued from a TC-83 infectious clone as described previously. TC-83 clone six TC-83 subclones containing mutations identified in the TC-83 RdRp or high-fidelity CHIKV RdRp were created by joining-PCR cDNA fragments from the TC-83 genome using designed primers. all viruses were rescued after electroporation into BHK cells as described previously in Greene et al. (2005). cDNA was produced using the superscript III First Round Synthesis kit. cDNA was amplified for sequencing using the Phusion enzyme. products were sequenced on the ABI 3700 sequencer (ABI, 3500) six-week post-vaccination, animals were challenged SC with 105 PFU of wt epidemic VEEV strain 3908. animals were euthanized 48-h post-inoculation, and their brains harvested and homogenized to determine viral titer by standard plaque assay. PCR was first done using sequence-specific primers tiled across the VEEV genome to provide amplified products of 1.5 kb in size. products were fragmented using transposons, then adapter ligation and amplification of the library was performed using the Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation kit. samples were tracked using the \u2018index tags\u2019 incorporated into the adapters. Mutation frequency per sample was calculated by summing per position diversities and normalizing by the number of positions for which diversity was calculated. 4.1 Ethics statement This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals of the national institute of health. ters of virus were determined by standard plaque assay using Vero cells. 4.3 Mutagenesis of TC-83 Parental TC-83 was passaged in the presence of mutagens, Ribavirin (Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO), 5\u2019Fluorouracil (5FU) or Azacytidine (Sigma Aldrich) at concentrations of 40 mM, 80 g/ml and 0.4 M. cells were pretreated 2 h cells were infected at an MOI of 1 (HEK-293) or 0.01 (Vero) in 12-well plates. were incubated for 1 h before being washed twice with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and overlaid with 2 ml of DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS and Pen/Strep (100 U/ml) cDNA was produced using the superscript III first round synthesis kit. the cells were infected with 0.01 MOI of the TC-83 mutants. the cells were then infected with 0.01 MOI of the TC-83 mutants. virulence, immunogenicity and protection studies were carried out. animals were euthanized 48-h post-inoculation, and their brains harvested and homogenized to determine viral titer by standard plaque assay. the homogenized brain was diluted to produce the same inoculum dose and used to initiate the subsequent passage. first and second strand synthesis, adapter ligation and amplification of the library were performed using the Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation kit. products were fragmented using transposons, then adapter ligation and amplification of the library was performed. samples were tracked using the \u2018index tags\u2019 incorporated into the adapters as defined by the manufacturer. diversity per position in the viral genome was calculated by taking a ratio of the reads mapped with mismatches and all reads mapped at that position. positions in which the number of reads mapped with mismatches was higher than perfectly mapped reads were excluded from diversity calculations. all reads mapped with mismatches were excluded from diversity calculations. positions with non-zero mutation frequency were considered variant positions."}
