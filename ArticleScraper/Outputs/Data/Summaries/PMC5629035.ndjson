{"summary": "HBV is a small DNA virus that chronically infects 240 million people worldwide. it causes approximately 686,000 deaths annually due to various severe liver diseases, including cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver failure. core protein is a small polypeptide of 183 amino acid residues. over the last two decades, at least five chemotypes of CpAMs have been reported. these compounds bind to a hydrophobic pocket, designated as the HAP pocket, at the dimer-dimer interface near the C-termini of core protein subunits. these compounds alter the capsid assembly kinetics and pathways. cccDNA became detectable as early as 1 day and reached maximum levels at 2 day post infection by qPCR and conventional Southern blot assays. we hypothesized that HBV CpAMs may disrupt capsid assembly, but also alter the structure and function of assembled nucleocapsids. cccDNA synthesis from a de novo infection and intracellular amplification pathways. CP cells were mock-treated or treated with representative HAP (Bay 41\u20134109, GLS4) or SBA (ENAN-34017) and control compounds entecavir (ETV) or myrcludex B (MyrB) starting at 24 h before HBV infection until harvesting at day 3 and day 6 post infection. ETV, an HBV DNA polymerase inhibitor, did not affect the synthesis of cccDNA and accumulation of pgRNA. HBV cccDNA (A), pgRNA (B) and cytoplasmic core DNA (C) were quantified by real-time PCR assays. differences in viral cccDNA, core DNA or pgRNA were statistically analyzed. all three CpAMs inhibited cccDNA formation in a concentration dependent manner. the cells were mock-treated or treated with the indicated concentrations of Bay 41\u20134109, GLS4 or ENAN-34017. cccDNA was quantified by a real-time PCR assay. inhibition of cccDNA formation is due to inhibition of NTCP-mediated HBV entry. cpAMs accelerate intracellular cccDNA synthesis from cytoplasmic progeny nucleocapsid rcDNA. inhibition of cccDNA is due to interaction with HBV-specific components. ocapsids and cccDNA amplification cannot be investigated in cells directly treated with those compounds. we first arrested HBV DNA replication by culturing cells in medium without tetracycline. the cells were then cultured in the presence of tetracycline to stop HBV pgRNA transcription from integrated transgene in cellular chromosome. cccDNA was readily detected as early as 9 h after the removal of PFA in cytoplasmic nucleocapsids. cccDNA was readily detected as early as 9 h after the removal of PFA in cytoplasmic nucleocapsids. analysis of effects of CpAMs on cccDNA synthesis. HepAD38 cells were treated with 2 mM of PFA from day 2 to day 6. cells were mock-treated or treated with 1 M of ETV, 1 M of GLS4, 2.5 M of Bay 41\u20134109 or 5 M of ENAN-34017. nucleocapsids were purified from the cytoplasmic fraction of PFA-treated cells. an endogenous DNA polymerase assay was performed in vitro. rcDNA synthesized in the presence of Bay 41\u20134109, ENAN-34017 or AT-61, but not AT-61. capsid assembly inhibitors do not inhibit completion of positive-strand DNA synthesis. intracellular capsids were purified by sucrose gradient centrifugation. three-fourths of each reaction were subjected for extraction of viral DNA without or with prior DNase I digestion. virion particles were treated with the CpAMs in an endogenous DNA polymerase reaction without dNTP and followed by DNase I treatment prior to DNA extraction. each of the three tested CpAMs rendered all virion DNA species susceptible to DNase I digestion in a concentration-dependent manner. each endogenous DNA polymerase reaction contains approximately 108 HBV virions prepared from chronic HBV carriers. 108 virions in each endogenous DNA polymerase reaction were incubated. rcDNA became susceptible to DNase I digestion at lower concentrations of GLS4 or ENAN-34017. this result strongly suggests that elongation of positive strand DNA in hepatocytes may incrementally induce structural changes of nucleocapsids and confer gradually increased sensitivity to the CpAM induction of viral DNA exposure. kinetics study further revealed that up to 6 h incubation required for ENAN-34017 to induce significant exposure of rcDNA. 1 to 2 h exposure was sufficient for GLS4 and Bay 41\u20134109 to induce extensive exposure of rcDNA. cytoplasmic lysates were mock-treated or treated with DNase I before extraction of DNA. the extent of disruption on the structure of mature nucleocapsids by the different CpAMs remains to be determined. we therefore examined whether the mature viral DNA species, rcDNA and double-stranded linear (dsl) DNA, were still associated with capsids after CpAM treatment. rcDNA and dslDNA were lost or reduced from capsids sedimenting to 21% to 25% sucrose after Bay 41\u20134109 or GLS4 treatment. the majority of rcDNA and dslDNA still co-sediment with capsids after ENAN-34017 treatment. the less active compound may only induce structural changes that render the DNA content susceptible to DNase digestion. reaction containing 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH8.0, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT and 0.1% NP-40 for at 37\u00b0C for 16 h. cccDNA became detectable as early as 1 day and reached maximum levels at 2. pgRNA and core-associated viral DNA replication intermediates accumulated sequentially in infected cultures. HBsAg was readily detectable by ELISA as a product of HBV infection in the culture media. C3AhNTCP cells were mock-treated or treated with representative HAP. C3AhNTCP cells were infected with HBV at an MOI of 500 genome equivalents. the cells were mock-treated or treated with 100nM of MyrB, 1 M of ETV, 2.5 M of Bay 41\u20134109, 1 M of GLS-4, 5 M of ENAN-34017 or 1,000 IU/ml of IFN-. myrB treatment starting at 24 h before or at the time of infection effectively blocked cccDNA formation. delayed treatment starting at 24 h post infection completely failed to inhibit cccDNA formation. all three CpAMs inhibited cccDNA formation in a concentration dependent manner. the cells were mock-treated or treated with the indicated concentrations of Bay 41\u20134109, GLS4 or ENAN-34017. differences in viral cccDNA between mock-treated control and treated group cultures under each treatment schedule were statistically analyzed. intracellular cccDNA amplification pathway has been demonstrated to function in cultured cells and in vivo in duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV)-infected ducks. cpAMs inhibit pgRNA encapsidation and thus preclude viral DNA replication and intracellular amplification of cccDNA. cccDNA amplification cannot be investigated in cells directly treated with those compounds. deproteinized rcDNA (DP-rcDNA) and cccDNA became readily detectable at 9 and 12 h, respectively. cccDNA was readily detected as early as 9 h after the removal of PFA in CpAM-treated cells. the cytoplasmic core DNA (B), cccDNA and DP-rcDNA (C) were analyzed by Southern blot hybridization. the relaxed circular (RC) DNA, double-stranded linear (DSL) DNA and full-length single stranded (SS) DNA species were indicated. the relative amounts of cccDNA were plotted. the relaxed circular (RC) DNA, double-stranded linear (DSL) DNA and cccDNA (CCC) species were indicated. 61, was susceptible to DNase I digestion at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. a native agarose gel electrophoresis-based particle gel assay revealed that the selected CpAMs alter the structure of, and destabilize mature rcDNA-containing nucleocapsids. the rcDNA-containing nucleocapsids only constitute a small fraction of cytoplasmic capsids. endogenous DNA polymerase reactions were performed in the presence of dNTP and indicated concentrations of bay 41\u20134109, ENAN-34017 or AT-61 for 16 h. the relaxed circular (RC) DNA, double-stranded linear (DSL) DNA and full-length single stranded (SS) DNA species were indicated. virion nucleocapsids derived from virion particles are sensitive to CpAM-induced structural changes that expose viral DNA for DNase I digestion. each endogenous DNA polymerase reaction contains approximately 108 HBV virions prepared from chronic HBV carriers. each endogenous DNA polymerase reaction contains approximately 108 HBV virions prepared from chronic HBV carriers. the less mature, partially double-stranded DNA species became susceptible to DNase I digestion under gradually increased concentrations. this result strongly suggests that elongation of positive strand DNA in hepatocytes may incrementally induce structural changes of nucleocapsids. the minimum concentrations of ENAN-34107, Bay 41\u20134109 and GLS4 that induce a complete exposure of rcDNA are approximately 0.3, 0.04 and 0.02 M. ENAN-34017 in reactions containing 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH8.0, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT and 0.1% NP-40 at 37\u00b0C for 16 h (A) or harvested at the indicated time of incubation (B). viral DNA were extracted without or with prior DNase I digestion at 37\u00b0C for 30 min and detected by Southern blot hybridization with a full-length ribo the amounts of total capsids and capsid-associated DNA in each of the fractions were analyzed by a 1.5% native agarose gel electrophoresis-based particle gel assay. treatment with any of the three CpAMs did not alter the sedimentation profile of capsids and capsid associated HBV DNA. however, analysis of viral DNA by Southern blot hybridization in each of the fractions revealed that rcDNA and dslDNA were lost or HBV capsids prepared from HepAD38 cells were mock treated (A) or incubated with 5 M ENAN-34017 (B), 3 M Bay 41\u20134109 (C) or 3 M GLS4 (D) in a reaction containing 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH8.0, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT and 0.1% NP-40 for at 37\u00b0C for 16 h. cccDNA pool size in infected hepatocytes is key determinant of cccDNA pool size in infected hepatocytes. targeting HBV core protein may disrupt multiple steps of HBV replication and activate innate immune response in virally infected cells. genome replication, their effects on other aspects of nucleocapsid function have not been investigated. we provide evidence suggesting that selected HAPs and SBAs are able to interact with nucleocapsids from virions and mature forms of rcDNA-containing nucleocapsids in the cytoplasm and interfere with their function of delivering viral rcDNA to the nuclei. a recent report showed that the carboxyl-terminal domain of core proteins is hypophosphorylated in DNA-containing virions, but remains hyperphosphorylated in intracellular DNA-containing nucleocapsids. the dephosphorylation may alter the interaction between core protein and viral DNA [53], and thus affect the nucleocapsid structure in a manner distinct from that of the hyperphosphorylated state [54]. in de novo infection, CpAMs may interact with nucleocapsids during endocytic entry or immediately after their release into the cytoplasm. the premature disassembly of nucleocapsids results in viral DNA release and decay by cytoplasmic DNases before its arrival to the nuclear pore complex for nuclear import and subsequent cccDNA synthesis. rcDNA decay in the cytoplasm may also occur. inhibition of cccDNA synthesis from de novo infection is detrimental. inhibition of pgRNA encapsidation by CpAMs will quickly block viral DNA replication and production of mature progeny nucleocapsids. the only chance for CpAMs to accelerate cccDNA synthesis during antiviral therapy is at the initial period of treatment to promote cccDNA synthesis. sembly of mature nucleocapsids occurs at or near the nuclear pore complex may facilitate the import of rcDNA into the nuclus for cccDNA synthesis. careful monitoring of cccDNA synthesis during the early phase of CpAM treatment in vivo in animals and in clinical trials. sequence was amplified from a cDNA clone purchased from Origene (SC118232) a carboxyl-terminal C9 tag was added by PCR amplification with the primers harboring C9 tag sequence. the purified PCR fragments were digested with restriction enzymes Not I and Bam HI and subsequently cloned into a pQCXIP vector. a fraction of cDNA preparation was digested with 1 unit of plasmid-safe adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent deoxyribonuclease (PSAD) in a 25 L reaction for 1 h at 37\u00b0C to remove rcDNA. the DNase was inactivated by incubation of the reactions for 30 min at 70\u00b0C. cccDNA in the PSAD-treated samples were quantified by a real membrane was probed with -32P-UTP labeled minus strand specific full-length HBV riboprobe. cells were co-transfected with plasmid containing three copies of HDV cDNA sequence (pSVLD3) and plasmid expressing HBV envelope proteins L, M and S (pSV45H) supernatant fluid was removed and pellet was dissolved in TNE buffer. cells were cultured in tetracycline-free medium with or without 2 mM Foscarnet. lysate was centrifuged for 5 min to remove nuclei and cell debris. endogenous DNA polymerase reaction (EPR) mixture was assembled with 20 l of HBV virion or capsid preparation. 25 l of 2x EPR buffer consisted of 0.15 M NaCl, 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 20 mM MgCl2, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.2% (vol/vol) Nonidet P-40. fugation analysis of HBV capsid integrity Two hundred microliters of the purified HBV capsids were mixed with 250 l of reaction buffer containing 0.15 M NaCl, 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 20 mM MgCl2, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.2% (vol/vol) Nonidet P-40. water was provided to bring the reaction volume to 500 l.
