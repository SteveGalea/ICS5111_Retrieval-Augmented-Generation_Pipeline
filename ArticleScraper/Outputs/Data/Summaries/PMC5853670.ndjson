{"summary": "six of the identified participants were considered confirmed cases. the remaining 8 participants were suspected cases based on a detailed questionnaire. participants were asked to complete a physical assessment, which included weight, height and blood pressure. a sample was determined mildly reactive if they harbored titers greater than 5 Units/mL. a 4.7 U/mL cutoff yielded 96.7% sensitivity and 97.7% specificity. a sample was determined mildly reactive if the serum antibody concentration was greater than the 1.0 Units/mL control calibrator. pseudotype viruses were titered on human rhabdomyosarcoma cells. the virus was incubated with serial dilutions of sera (1:50, 1:250, 1:1250, 1:6250) each plate contained identical controls. infection rates in presence of negative control serum expressed as percentage of infection in presence of negative control serum. serum from the patients had to at least neutralize approximately 50% of virus compared to appropriate control. 300 L of virus/serum inoculum was added to triplicate wells of a 6-well plate containing 90%\u2013100% confluent Vero E6 cells. after incubation, 2 mL of overlay (1.25% Avicel in minimal essential media) was added to each well before incubation at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 8 days. the cells were seeded one day prior at 4 104 cells/well in 96-well plates (Greiner bio-one 655948) and 1 106 cells/well in 6-well plates (Corning 3506), respectively, and incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. a sample was determined mildly reactive if they harbored titers greater than 5 Units/mL of the purified IgG control calibrator. mayinga EBOV Zaire viral protein 40 (VP40; bp 583\u2013981) was cloned into the pRen2 plasmid. cell lysates were harvested and used in immunoprecipitation assays. beads were washed 4 times with buffer A and 1 time with phosphate buffered saline. pNL-Luc viral backbone obtained through the NIH AIDS Reagent Program. pseudotypes were pelleted through a 20% sucrose cushion by ultracentrifugation for 1.5 hours at 4\u00b0C and 27000 rpm in a SW-28 rotor. the viral pellet resuspended in 1/100 volume of Hank\u2019s buffered saline solution overnight at 4\u00b0C. LPs were incubated with serial dilutions of sera (1:50, 1:250, 1:1250, 1:6250) before spin-infection of target cells. the virus/sample mixture is then incubated with cells, and nonneutralized virus infects cell monolayers. the antibody titer can be calculated by comparing the number of virus plaques in each sample dilution well to the virus-only control wells (no test sample) the plates were washed with tap water and dried, and the total number of plaque forming units (PFUs) were counted and recorded for each well. an anti-Ebola virus antibody from IBT Bioservices (#01-0004) was used as a positive control. RESULTS Study Population Fourteen individuals were identified as survivors of the 1976 EBOV outbreak in Yambuku, DRC. eight participants were male and 6 were female, ranging from 55 to 86 years of age (between 15 and 46 years of age at the time of infection) six of these individuals were classified as confirmed EBOV cases. 23.79% 7 28 68 M Suspected + 13.13% 36.12% 8 22 62 M Confirmed + + + + 69.12% 80.10% 1:60 1:30 1:30 9 28 68 F Suspected + + + 37.38% 37.89% 10 33 73 F Suspected + 41.33% 51.63% 11 21 61 M Suspected + + + 10.14% 35.82% 12 46 86 F Suspected + 22.77% 17.98% 1:120 all 14 subjects were run on PRNT platform. survivors harboring antibodies that were able to neutralize live EBOV to at least 50% of control are marked in bold font. antibody titers measuring reactivity to EBOV nucleoprotein (NP) using ELISA. luciferase signal obtained after immunoprecipitating EBOV viral protein 40 (VP40)-Luc using patient serum samples. three survivors demonstrated capacity to neutralize the pseudovirus >50% using a serum dilution factor of 1:50. 4 survivors (29.0%) were able to neutralize live EBOV using a serum dilution factor of 1:50. ES-4, 8, 12, and 13 were able to neutralize live EBOV using a PRNT. despite the inability to neutralize pseudovirus, our PRNT revealed that subject ES-12 neutralized live EBOV to at least 50% of control at a 1:120 serum dilution with nonactive compliment proteins. it should be noted, however, that the neutralization curve is atypical for ES-12, which may indicate that this patient simply exhibited nonspecific inhibition, or toxicity.

ES-4, 8, 12, and 13 were able to neutralize live virus using a PRNT. ebola survivors were able to neutralize at least 50% of live virus. 1 of the 4 neutralizing survivors had a strong enough response to neutralize 80% of virus on the PRNT. bars represent the standard deviation obtained from the data between multiple tests conducted using serum from each ES. despite the identifying levels of GP (12/14) and NP (13/14) reactivity, we only identified 3/14 survivors as retaining immunoreactivity to VP40. the findings are comparable to an earlier study of serological responses to the related Sudan Ebola virus (EBOV-S), suggesting that VP40 appears to be less commonly immunogenic than GP or NP [27]. the majority of survivors react at least mildly to GP, yet are unable to neutralize may indicate that GP response is not necessarily the best indicator of downstream neutralization. however, protective antibodies are not necessarily always neutralizing using in vitro assays. this leads to the possibility that in vivo, our survivor cohort may all be protected from reinfection because there have not been documented cases of reinfection with EBOV. participants in this study represent the long-term survivors of EVD from the 1976 Yambuku outbreak. they represent a unique and highly important cohort, enabling the opportunity to glean insight into the long-term immune response against this potent pathogen. this population is among the lowest in the world."}
