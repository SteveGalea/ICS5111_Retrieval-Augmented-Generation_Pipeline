{"summary": "p62 is a protein that is degraded mainly by autophagy. accumulation of p62 marks suppression of the autophagy flux. p62 is a reliable indicator of autophagy flux in cells30,31,32. chloroquine treatment of the cells led to reduced viral yields in cells. some of these agents suffer from side effects that make it difficult to interpret whether the results are directly caused by autophagy. however, some of these agents suffer from side effects that make it difficult to interpret whether the results are directly caused by autophagy. HCE cells were mock-treated or treated with BFN for 16 hours. the cells were then harvested, lysed and immunoblotted. qPCR assay confirmed that BFN treatment significantly reduced HSV-2 infection. qPCR HSV-2 genome quantification from HSV-2-infected, mock-treated or BFN-treated, HCE cells at 16 hpi. cell death was assessed using MTT assay. mouse embryonic fibroblasts are incapable of executing autophagy. LC3-GFP-expressing WT or ATG5/ MEFs were cultured in regular serum-containing medium (Fed) or starved for 3 hr. the cells were then fixed and imaged using confocal microscopy at 63x magnification. compared to WT cells, ATG5/ cells showed significantly lower viral yields. even at higher MOIs, ATG5/ cells seemed highly resistant to infection. qPCR assay also showed that ATG5 knockout in cells dramatically diminishes the infection. based on the integrated MFI (=percentage X MFI) of the GFP-positive population in the gated region R3. the graph shows relative fluorescence levels of infected cells to background of uninfected cells. infection was monitored microscopically at 12 hpi. human foreskin fibroblasts were infected with HSV-2 for 2 hrs. at 20 hpi, intracellular viral genomes were determined by qPCR. p62 is a protein that is degraded mainly by autophagy. accumulation of p62 marks suppression of the autophagy flux. its depletion reflects autophagy induction30,31,32. this result indicated that HSV-2 prevents autophagy induction in response to infection, but maintains the basal autophagy activity of the host mostly unhampered. chloroquine and vinblastine were shown to cause autophagy-complicating nonspecific effects such as mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition. however, some of these agents suffer from side effects that make it difficult to interpret whether the results are directly caused by autophagy. qPCR assay confirmed that BFN-mediated block of autophagy suppressed viral yields and HSV-2 infection. suppression of basal autophagy in host cells interferes with viral replication and the progress of infection. the possibility of cell death upon BFN treatment was ruled out. we used mouse embryonic fibroblasts that are incapable of executing autophagy due to a genetic knockout of the autophagy-essential gene ATG519,36. 18 genes are essential for development and maturation of autophagosomes37. the cells were then fixed and imaged using confocal microscopy at 63x magnification. the cells were then fixed and imaged using confocal microscopy at 63x magnification. qPCR assay also showed that ATG5 knockout in cells dramatically diminishes the infection. qPCR assay also showed that ATG5 knockout in cells dramatically diminishes the infection. after 24 hr, the supernatants of infected cells were collected and titered using plaque assay. after 24 hr, the supernatants of infected cells were collected and titered using plaque assay. human foreskin fibroblasts were infected with HSV-2-GFP for 2 hrs. at 20 hpi, intracellular viral genomes were determined by qPCR. a closely related -herpesvirus, varicella-zoster virus (VZV), which lacks the ICP34.5 gene can allow robust induction of autophagy responses to infection40,41. a closely related -herpesvirus, varicella-zoster virus (VZV), which lacks the ICP34.5 gene can allow robust induction of autophagy responses to infection40,41. suckling and non-suckling mice all died at the same time, within 1 day of birth38. absence of induced autophagy in HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection suggests a role for this basal autophagy that supports infection. some scenarios may be proposed based on lessons learned from other viruses. autophagy-deficient cells showed increased NALP3 inflammasome activity and caspase-1 levels. autophagy could limit inflammasome activity directly through targeting inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 for autolysosomal degradation. dysregulation of metabolism and turnover of metabolites known to regulate infection68,69 may contribute to their resistance to HSV-2 infection. a distinct role of autophagy machinery in enodosomal trafficking and endolysosomal functions was recently reported70. MEFs, ARPE19, human foreskin fibroblasts and vero cells were grown in Dulbecco Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium (DMEM; Gibco) supplemented with antibiotics and serum. Viruses HSV-2 (strain 333) and HSV-2 (333)-GFP viruses were provided by J. Vieira. the cells were washed in FACS buffer (PBS, 1% BSA, 0.05% NaN3) and analyzed cytofluorimetrically on LSRFortessa cytometer (BD) Viral genome isolation and quantification Cell pellets were re-suspended in buffer containing 1% SDS, 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), and 10 mM EDTA. DNA was then extracted by phenol/chloroform extraction-ethanol precipitation transfection Transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invuitrogen) according to manufacturer's guidelines. the cells were washed in PBS for three times to remove residual medium. after treatment, the cells were washed, fixed in paraformaldehyde, and used in imaging. human retinal pigment epithelial cell line (ARPE19), human foreskin fibroblasts, and African green monkey foetal kidney epithelial (Vero) cells were grown in Dulbecco Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium (DMEM; Gibco) supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma) infection The cells were incubated with the virus in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 0.1% glucose and 1% serum at 37 \u00b0C-5% CO2 conditions. after 2 hrs, the virus was removed and fresh medium was added to the cells. the cell extract was incubated with proteinase K (50 g/mL) at 37 \u00b0C for 1 hr. DNA was then extracted by phenol/chloroform extraction-ethanol precipitation procedure. the cells were washed, fixed in paraformaldehyde, and used in imaging. cells were grown for 72 hrs, then fixed and stained with crystal violet. plaque counts were used to calculate viral titers. cell viability was assessed using MTT assay."}
