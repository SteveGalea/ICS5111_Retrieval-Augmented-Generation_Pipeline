{"summary": "the arsenal of antimalarial drugs is limited and currently the most effective treatment against the pathogenic agent Plasmodium falciparum includes artemisinin combination therapies. resistance to artemisinins has been reported in four countries of the south-east Asia region: Cambodia, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam [2,3] the need for new antimalarial therapies has stimulated research into the search for synthetic molecules that are effective against acquired resistance to artemisinin derivatives. this study led to the selection of a lead candidate with optimal oral absorption properties. all compounds showed potency against the P. falciparum chloroquine-resistant clone W2. the compound 1a had the best selectivity index (9.0) physicochemical properties of 4-methoxychalcone derivatives 1a\u2013i. pIC50 cLog P LipE a 1a 387.45 5.685 2.34 3.345 1b 345.41 5.237 2.74 2.497 1c 393.46 5.692 3.87 1.822 1d 423.48 5.439 3.74 1.699 1d 427.90 5.549 4.42 1.129 1f 462.35 5.364 4.98 cLogP versus molecular weight distribution of synthesized 4-methoxychalcone derivatives. lipophilicity, clearance and volume of distribution are also important to consider in the profile of drug candidates. lipophilic efficiency (LipE) helps in establishing a more balanced relationship. cLogP versus pIC50 plot showed a distribution along lines of identical LipE values. cLogP versus pIC50 plot and LipE analysis. it is interesting to observe that substitution of the pyrrolidine group in 1i by a morpholine group in 1a had similar potency. Compound 1a docked into the plasmepsin-2 (PL-2) binding site. Highlighting the H-bond with residue Thr217 and oxygen atom. the binding free energy of compound 1f, determined to be the most optimal chalcone derivative, for falcipain-2 (6.5 Kcal/mol), plasmepsin-4 (7.6 Kcal/mol) and plasmepsin-2 (8.5 Kcal/mol) showed a better interaction for aspartic proteases. compound 1f does not exhibit the best physical chemistry parameters for oral administration. the majority of the compounds were active in vitro against P. falciparum with low cytotoxicity. but they lacked oral bioavailability due to poor ADMET properties. physicochemical properties of our chalcone derivatives 1a\u2013i. 84 1g 387.49 4.959 4.83 0.129 1h 407.48 5.707 4.17 1.537 1i 371.45 5.683 3.05 2.633 CQ b 515.86 6.343 3.73 2.613 a LipE = pIC50 \u2013 cLogP; b chloroquine There is a general consensus that the molecular properties of drug candidates are important ADMET properties. high potency compounds reduce the chances that a drug will lack specificity for its target. the concept of Lipophilic Efficiency (LipE) helps in establishing a more balanced relationship between the potency observed in vitro and lipophilicity properties of evaluated chemical compounds. Figure 5 highlights a short distance between the,-unsaturated carbonyl moiety (Michael acceptor) of 1a and carboxylate anion (Michael donor) of Asp214, suitable for a nucleophilic attack resulting in an alkylation process.
