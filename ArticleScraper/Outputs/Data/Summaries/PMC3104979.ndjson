{"summary": "maternal influenza vaccine information was available for 4,168 (96.3%) among 4,326 live births between 1 June 2004 and 30 September 2006. the primary intervention evaluated was receipt of influenza vaccine during any trimester of pregnancy. infants born during the putative influenza season (1 October\u201331 May) were less likely to be premature compared to infants of unvaccinated mothers born in the same period. influenza is associated with increased morbidity and mortality among pregnant women compared to women who are not pregnant or who acquire influenza infection after delivery. some respiratory infections, especially those that can cause maternal pneumonia, are known to be associated with the baby being small\u2014below the 10th percentile\u2014for gestational age. researchers used logistic regression to evaluate association of maternal influenza vaccine and (a) prematurity and (b) small for gestational age. compared with newborns of unvaccinated mothers, infants of vaccinated mothers also had 69% lower odds of being small for gestational age. influenza vaccination during pregnancy is the most effective tool to prevent morbidity and mortality due to influenza. a randomized controlled clinical trial in Bangladesh demonstrated that vaccination of pregnant women with the inactivated influenza vaccine had 63% effectiveness in reducing laboratory-confirmed influenza in their infants. the primary exposure variable was receipt of inactivated influenza vaccine during any trimester of pregnancy by mothers of infants born between 1 June 2004 and 30 September 2006. the main outcomes assessed were prematurity and SGA. the PRAMS sample is drawn monthly from the state's birth file. influenza activity is considered local if there are influenza outbreaks or increases in influenza-like illness with recent laboratory-confirmed influenza in at least two but fewer than half the regions of the state. the pre-influenza period is characterized by the availability of the vaccine and the absence of influenza activity. logistic regression was used to evaluate the association of maternal influenza vaccine and (a) prematurity and (b) SGA. a group of covariates would move the odds ratios of association between maternal influenza immunization and birth outcomes during the pre-influenza period to 1.0 (i.e., no effect), thus arriving at a set of covariates. varie models modified the association between maternal influenza vaccine and the birth outcome and moved the OR towards 1. if dropping a covariate resulted in moving ORs away from 1 and a change in magnitude of less than 1%, we removed the covariate that caused the least change and then repeated the process. the population prevented fraction for a vaccine estimates the reduction in an outcome given the efficacy/effectiveness of the vaccine and the specific vaccine coverage. the population prevented fraction for a vaccine estimates the reduction in an outcome given the efficacy/effectiveness of the vaccine. we used gender-specific reference values for the US published by Oken at al. [9] to assign SGA (yes/no) categories. we used a modified version of the CSTE report categories of influenza activity. Statistical analysis and confounder assessment In Georgia PRAMS, live births to black women and those that are low birth weight are oversampled. logistic regression was used to evaluate the association of maternal influenza vaccine and (a) prematurity and (b) SGA. variables for each birth outcome were evaluated for potential confounding by selecting the covariates that modified the association between maternal influenza vaccine and the birth outcome. we excluded the variable whose removal moved the OR the most towards 1 and a change in magnitude of less than 1%, we removed the covariate that caused the least change and repeated the process. the population prevented fraction for a vaccine estimates the reduction in an outcome given the efficacy/effectiveness of the vaccine and the specific vaccine coverage. a total of 4,326 women (and their newborns) were included in the study. insured women were more likely to have received the influenza vaccine (OR = 1.41; 95% CI, 1.09\u20131.81). gestational age at first prenatal visit was similar for vaccinated women and unvaccinated women. maternal weight before pregnancy was similar for vaccine recipients and non-recipients. birth defect 16 (15.4) 87 (1.4) 562 (15.0) 4,081 (98.6) 0.94 1.03 (0.41\u20132.61) Maternal diabetes 10 (5.2) 100 (2.0) 567 (15.2) 4,057 (98.0) 0.03 0.30 (0.08\u20130.95) Hypertension 39 (15.1) 316 (4.1) 538 (15.0) 3,841 (95.9) 0.97 1.01 (0.57\u20131.78) Multivitamin use in pregnancy 31 (9.3) 306 (6. the odds of having received the influenza vaccine were 22% higher among married women than among unmarried women. the group of covariates in the prematurity multivariate models included gestational age for first antenatal visit, maternal diabetes (gestational and/or non) covariates included maternal age less than 19 y, maternal medical risk factors, labor/delivery complications, birth defects, and alcohol use during pregnancy. infants born during the putative influenza season (1 October\u201331 May) were less likely to be premature than infants of unvaccinated mothers born in the same period. primary adjusted models were based on identifying covariates that produce adjusted ORs of 1 during the pre-influenza period. covariates included gestational age at first antenatal visit, maternal age less than 19 y, maternal age more than 35 y, multiple births, maternal medical risk factors, labor/delivery complications, birth defects, maternal diabetes (gestational and/or non-gestational), hypertension, education less than 12th grade, and mother married. the odds of prematurity in newborns of mothers who received the influenza vaccine during pregnancy were 25% lower among the infants of unvaccinated women. those born to vaccinated mothers had lower odds of SGA (adjusted OR = 0.31; 95% CI, 0.13\u20130.75) during the period of widespread influenza activity. the primary adjusted models were based on identifying covariates that produce adjusted ORs of 1 during the pre-influenza period. the covariates included gestational age at first antenatal visit, maternal age less than 19 y, maternal age more than 35 y, multiple births, maternal medical risk factors, labor/delivery complications, birth defects, maternal diabetes (gestational and/or non-gestational), hypertension, education less than 12th grade, and mother married. newborns of vaccinated women were, on average, 96.7 g heavier than newborns of unvaccinated women. the difference between the two groups increased to 113 g. there were no significant differences in birth weights outside the putative influenza season. odds of prematurity were approximately 70% lower among the newborns of the vaccinated mothers compared to mothers who did not receive the influenza vaccine. the magnitude of association between influenza vaccine and prematurity increased with the increase in the intensity of influenza activity. the 2004\u20132005 influenza season was more intense than the 2005\u20132006 season in the us. the use of the pre-influenza period for selecting confounders from a broad set of covariates is an approach suggested by Nelson et al. [12] and Jackson et al. [11] that takes advantage of the seasonality of influenza circulation. the association observed in our study was robust to adjustment for confounders identified using this approach. NF-, interferon (IFN)-, IFN-, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor are strongest for intrauterine viral infections. the association is strongest for intrauterine viral infections and systemic and intrauterine bacterial infections. a recent literature review found that SARS infection in the second or third trimester of pregnancy may be associated with spontaneous preterm delivery. the association between maternal influenza vaccination and SGA was only statistically significant (and the highest in magnitude) for the period of widespread influenza activity. possible reasons for the effect being limited to the period of highest influenza activity include: (a) in a developed country setting, the effect of maternal influenza infection on fetal growth is milder than the effect on prematurity; (b) SGA represents fetal compromise resulting from infection that is insufficient to trigger early parturition. the PRAMS dataset does not contain information regarding the precise trimester of vaccination. it is possible that mothers of premature infants had less time to receive influenza vaccine than term infants."}
