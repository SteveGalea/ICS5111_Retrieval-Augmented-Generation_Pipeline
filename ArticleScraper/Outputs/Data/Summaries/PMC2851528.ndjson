{"summary": "deer mice were trapped near Fort Lewis, Colorado. whole blood was diluted (1:100) in 1 mL of phosphate-buffered saline. the remainder of the blood was frozen on dry ice and returned to the laboratory for additional testing. samples from 222 deer mice were collected during 3 trapping sessions in the summer of 2006. one sample (HA-2564) was scored negative by field and laboratory PAGEIA. 0.327/0.055 Pos HA-2565 1+ 0.236 Pos 0.715/0.046 Pos HA-2567 4+ 2.123 Pos 1.485/0.080 Pos HB-2604 4+ 2.065 Pos 1.161/0.067 Pos HB-2608 2+ 0.855 Pos 0.653/0.095 Pos HB-2612 1+ 0.282 Pos 1.136/0.071 Pos HB-2616 1+ 0.311 Pos 0.458/0.001 Pos HB- field-collected samples were retested by PAGEIA under laboratory conditions. OD was recorded for diluted (1:100) blood with both SNV antigen (numerator) and control antigen (denominator) the OD of the laboratory EIA with antigen was 0.293. of the 39 samples that were scored positive in the field, 5 discrepancies between these and laboratory tests were found. one sample (TS-0830\u20137) scored as 1+ in the field was negative on subsequent laboratory testing by both PAGEIA and conventional EIA. the other 4 samples (HB-2628, HA-2609, HA-2616, HB-2710) were scored as positive by field and laboratory PAGEIA. deer mice are the population most likely to be naturally infected with that virus. the rapid PAGEIA can detect only seropositivity, which is not necessarily indicative of current infection or of current shedding of virus. it is not useful for discriminating other immunoglobulin classes, such as IgM. coronavirus-like viruses and Nipah virus in bats."}
