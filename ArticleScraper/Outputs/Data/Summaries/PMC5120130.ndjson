{"summary": "PBVs are small non-enveloped bisegmented double-stranded RNA viruses found in human and a wide variety of mammals and birds. in 2012, we reported the discovery of a PBV, named otarine PBV (Ot-PBV), in a California sea lion (Zalophus californianus) in Hong Kong. as of December 31, 2015, 931 PBV nucleotide sequences have been submitted to GenBank. however, only nine are complete/near-complete segment 1 sequences and 21 are complete/near-complete segment 2 sequences. genogroup I PBVs may exist in different animals of the same species. those of pigs and cattle were collected from various locations in HKSAR. those of horses were collected with the assistance of the Hong Kong Jockey Club. all specimens of rabbits were collected from live food animal markets in Guangzhou, China, in October 2007. RNA Extraction Viral was extracted from rectal and cloacal swabs and fecal samples using EZ1 Virus Mini Kit v2.0 (Qiagen, Germany) RNA was eluted in 60 l of AVE buffer (Qiagen, Germany) about 200 ng of RNA was used as template for RT-PCR. mM Tris-HCl pH 8.3, 50 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2), 200 M of each dNTPs and 1.0 U Taq polymerase were amplified in 60 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 1 min, 50\u00b0C for 1 min and 72\u00b0C for 1 min. the mixtures were amplified in 60 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 1 min, 50\u00b0C for 1 min and 72\u00b0C for 1 min and a the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the viral genomes were confirmed by rapid amplification of cDNA ends using the 5\u2032/3\u2032 RACE kit (Roche, Germany). the PCR products were gel purified and sequenced using an ABI Prism 3700 DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems, USA) 10 l FastStart DNA master SYBR green I mix reagent (Roche) and 5 mM each of forward and reverse specific primers were thermal-cycled at 95\u00b0C for 10 min followed by 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 10 s, 60\u00b0C for 10 s and 72\u00b0C for 20 s using a Roche LightCycler 96 real time PCR system (Roche, Germany) 20080911 CCATGACTCAAGTCCTTACTAGT TTTAGTGATCCGCTGGTCGACGGCA PF090302 Segment 2 5.4 104 20090304 ACTAGCCACGGTCTGGAT ACACACACCATCTTGCCGAT Caddy PF080910 Segment 1 1.7 104 20080912 GAAGATGGTTATACCATTAGTGGTTA AACTGTGAAGGAATTTTGAATCTG PF080910 Segment 2 1.3 106 20090310 GGTTTGGACGCATATCAAGA ACATTCTAGTTATAGCTCGA Terry PF080915 Segment 1 4.6 106 20080912 GAAGATATGGCTATTATGAGTGGTGA CCAGATTGTAGCATTTTCGATCTG PF080915 Segment 2-1 7.8 105 20080912 CCATGACTCAAGTCCTTACTAGT TTTAGTGATCGATCTG PF080915 Segment 2-2 pigs and cattle were collected from various locations in HKSAR. those of horses were collected with the assistance of the Hong Kong Jockey Club. all specimens of rabbits were collected from live food animal markets in Guangzhou, china.

Adaptor primer was ligated to the 3\u2032 termini of the viral RNA and subjected to reverse transcription using complementary primer. the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the viral genomes were confirmed by rapid amplification of cDNA ends using the 5\u2032/3\u2032 RACE kit (Roche, Germany). 1 l cDNA, 10 l FastStart DNA master SYBR green I mix reagent (Roche) and 5 mM each of forward and reverse specific primers were thermal-cycled at 95\u00b0C for 10 min. PCR products were subjected to a melting curve analysis (65\u201395\u00b0C, 0.1\u00b0C/s) to confirm the specificity of the assay.

BV HuPBV-E-CDC16 (GenBank number KJ663816) and human PBV VS10 (GenBank number GU968924) they possess three conserved motifs (D-T/S-D, SG-T, GDD) common in the RdRp sequences of other dsRNA viruses. phylogenetic analyses of ORF2 (A), capsid (B) and RdRp proteins of otarine PBVs (C) were constructed using the RdRp gene. the clade of each otarine PBV is also indicated. 104 to 5.9 106 (for segment 1) and 4.1 103 to 1.3 106 (for segment 2) copies/ml in the fecal samples. segment 2 could be detected and sequenced in all 12 samples. segment 1 could only be detected and sequenced in seven samples due to the limited number of segment 1 PBV sequences available in GenBank. RT-PCR for a 205-bp fragment in the RdRp gene of genogroup I PBVs was positive in specimens from six cattle, six monkeys, 17 horses, nine pigs, one rabbit, one dog, and 12 sea lions. nucleotide polymorphisms were observed in most of the specimens. the PCR products were cloned and 10 clones from each specimen were sequenced. multiple sequence types were confirmed to be present in most samples. the corresponding sequences of other genogroup I PBV strains were widely distributed in the whole phylogenetic tree with high diversity. otarine PBVs Complete Segments 1 and 2 Sequence Analysis Nine complete segments 1 of otarine PBVs from sea lions were sequenced and assembled. these segment 1 sequences ranged from 2,158 to 2,522 bases in length with overall G+C contents of 41.1\u201346.0%. the 5\u2032 non-coding regions (44\u2013169 bases) were AU-rich (G+C contents of 22.7\u201337.9%) with five conserved bases, GUAAA, the protein encoded by the ORF2 of segment 1 from the nine otarine PBVs possessed different numbers of repetitions of the same motif, ExxRxNxxxE. the protein encoded by the ORF2 of segment 1 from the nine otarine PBVs possessed different numbers of repetitions. the name of each California sea lion, year of sample collection and clade (C1\u2013C4 and R1\u2013R9) for each otarine PBV are indicated for the nine segment 1 sequences. upstream to the capsid protein, ORF1 and ORF2 are represented by orange and green boxes respectively. the three different types of previously undescribed ORF upstream to the RdRp in six of the 15 segment 2 sequences are represented by boxes highlighted with different colors. six of our 15 sequenced segment 2 sequences possess a previously undescribed ORF 48\u201371 amino acids upstream to the RdRp ORF. in the first group, the three ORFs showed 97.6\u201399.4% nucleotide identities among each other. in the second group, the two ORFs showed 100% nucleotide identity. the 15 sequenced segment 2 of the otarine PBVs were clustered into nine distinct clades (R1\u2013R9). there were >14% amino acid difference between any two clades. the trees are constructed using maximum likelihood method. in the 12 samples that were positive for PBV, segment 2 could be detected and sequenced in all 12 samples. segment 1 could only be detected and sequenced in seven samples due to difficulties in designing PCR primers. more than one clade of segment 2 was present in three of the 12 samples. gene sequences of otarine PBVs obtained from the present study were deposited in GenBank with accession numbers KU729746\u2013KU729769. despite the relatively high evolutionary rate of RNA viruses, those that infect a specific host usually fall into several discrete viral species. s of PBVs amplified from human samples downloaded from the GenBank. in the present study on PBVs of different animal hosts, a similar phenomenon was observed. PBVs from horses, pigs, and cattle were widely distributed in the whole phylogenetic tree. in addition no two PBVs were detected to be the same among the 52 positive samples, except for that found in two pairs of sea lions. more than one segment 1 and/or more than one segment 2 were observed in at least five fecal samples of the sea lions in this study. the presence of more than one segment 1 and/or more than one segment 2 in the same sample is rare in other segmented RNA viruses. encoding RdRp in the segment 2 sequences of six otarine PBVs in this study. these three types of ORFs showed no homology to any known proteins. the most thoroughly studied segmented RNA viruses are influenza viruses (negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus) and rotaviruses (double-stranded RNA virus) possible otarine PBVs detected in serial fecal samples of California sea lions collected in different years are shown. possible reassortment of segments 1 and 2 of different clades (C1\u2013C4 and R1\u2013R9) circulating in the California sea lions are also indicated."}
