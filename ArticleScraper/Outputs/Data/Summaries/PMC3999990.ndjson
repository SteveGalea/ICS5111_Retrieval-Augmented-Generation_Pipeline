{"summary": "age correlated with more adverse disease outcomes following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection in humans. age- and infection-dependent differences were observed in both systemic and mucosal immune compartments. the elderly have heightened susceptibility to infection, an increased risk of developing severe viral-induced pulmonary disease and slower recovery rates. the decline in immune function with age also results in reduced vaccine efficacy, further enhancing susceptibility to infection in the elderly. age and comorbidities were significantly associated with increased risk of SARS-CoV related death. advanced age and comorbidities were significantly associated with increased risk of SARS-CoV related death due to acute respiratory distress syndrome [15-18] nonhuman primates undergo immune senescence similar to what has been described for humans [24,25] the aim of this study was to determine how the peripheral and mucosal immune responses to SARS-CoV infection compare in the aged and juvenile nonhuman primate host. the difference in titers between age groups was negligible. SARS-CoV titers were measured in nasal swabs and in several respiratory tissues by plaque assays. no significant age-dependent differences in SARS-CoV levels were observed in aged and juvenile monkeys. l per nasal swab (+/SE) are graphed on a log scale. aged n = 5, juvenile n = 6 for each tissue. venous thrombosis was observed in 17-18% of juvenile animals. a marked increase in the incidence of interstitial pneumonia was observed in juvenile but not aged monkeys at 10 d.p.i. (83% in juvenile versus only 20% in aged) the histologic changes associated with SARS-CoV-induced pneumonia were slightly lower in incidence and severity in the aged compared to juvenile host. the total white blood cell counts for aged monkeys were lower than their juvenile counterparts at pre- and post SARS-CoV infection time points. age was a significant source of variation for lymphocyte numbers with reduced CD8 T cells and B cells in the peripheral blood of aged compared to juvenile animals. serum cytokine profile during SARS-CoV infection in aged and juvenile monkeys was defined using bead-based protein arrays focusing on inflammatory cytokines and chemokines associated with antiviral responses. levels of IL-12 and IFN-gamma were similar but had a trend of being higher in the aged monkeys whereas CCL2 was higher in juveniles. il-23 34.1 6.8 58.1 15.4 37.5 14.6 45.0 21.2 24.4 8.8 75.9 42.1 IFN-y 0.7 0.3 1.1 0.3 1.6 0.9 2.7 0.8 2.5 1.1 3.8 2.6 CCL2 1657.5 129.5 1631.0 463.9 3279.1 619.9 1920.4 535.5 1826.0 5972 1160.0 415.0 d.p.i. proinflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and IL-6 were significantly lower in aged as compared to juvenile animals at 5 and 10 d.p.i. respectively. aged monkeys showed significantly lower levels of IL-12 at day 5 and lower IL-15 and IL-18 at 10 d.p.i. as compared to juvenile animals. the chemokine milieu in the lungs following SARS-CoV infection was evaluated in aged and juvenile animals by targeted protein arrays. several of the chemokines showed increased expression with SARS-CoV infection and were detected at higher levels in the aged compared to the juvenile host. however, CXCL11 levels in the aged lung did not reach the same magnitude as the juveniles. inflammatory lung infiltrates in SARS-CoV infection differ in aged compared to juvenile animals at 10 d.p.i. the number of total lung leukocytes per gram lung tissue was similar at 5 d.p.i. but was significantly lower in the aged as compared to juvenile animals at 10 d.p.i. most infection time points, significantly lower CD8 T cell and B cell frequencies were detected in aged monkeys. no age-dependent differences in the leukocyte numbers or frequency of T and B cells were noted in the tracheobronchial lymph nodes. chemokine receptor profile was assessed on monocytes/macrophages, DCs and CD8 T cells. expression of the activation marker CD86 showed significant age-dependent differences in the monocytes, lung macrophages and DC populations.

Graphs represent average values, n = 5 for aged and n = 6 for juvenile. all animals showed a slight initial decrease in body weight with SARS-CoV inoculation. time post infection but not age was a significant source of variation for the fold change in body weight. body temperature fluctuated throughout the infection time course. the average plaque-forming units (PFU) per ml per nasal swab are graphed on a log scale. the average plaque-forming units (PFU) per ml per nasal swab (+/SE) are graphed on a log scale. venous thrombosis was observed in 17-18% of the juvenile animals at both 5 and 10 d.p.i. severity of lung pathology was only slightly higher in aged as compared to juvenile animals at 5 d.p.i. 0% 0% aSeverity is the average grade for the group (0 = normal, 1 = minimal, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = marked); incidence is the percentage of the group affected. systemic and mucosal SARS-CoV-induced inflammatory responses were compared in aged and juvenile animals. the serum cytokine profile during SARS-CoV infection in aged and juvenile monkeys was defined using bead-based protein arrays focusing on inflammatory cytokines and chemokines associated with antiviral responses. the levels of IL-12 and IFN-gamma were similar but had a trend of being higher in the aged monkeys. iFN-y 0.7 0.3 1.1 0.3 1.6 0.9 2.7 0.8 2.5 1.1 3.8 2.6 CCL2 1657.5 129.5 1631.0 463.9 3279.1 619.9 1920.4 535.5 1826.0 5972 1160.0 415.0 d.p.i. proinflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and IL-6 were significantly lower in aged as compared to juvenile animals at 5 and 10 d.p.i. respectively. aged monkeys showed significantly lower levels of IL-12 at day 5 and lower IL-15 and IL-18 at 10 d.p.i. as compared to juveniles. interferon-gamma was below the level of detection in aged lung samples. IL-15 (D), IL-18 (E) and IL-21 (F) were compared in aged and juvenile monkeys. chemokine milieu in the lungs following SARS-CoV infection was evaluated in aged and juvenile animals by targeted protein arrays. chemokines CXCL11 (A), CCL5 (B), IL-8 (C), CXCL13 (D), CXCL12 (E), CCL20 (F) were measured in standardized collected lung tissue homogenates of the right caudal lung lobe by bead-based arrays as in Figure 3. inflammatory lung infiltrates in SARS-CoV infection differ in aged compared to juvenile animals at 10 d.p.i. juvenile animals in mock and SARS-CoV infection reached significance at 10 d.p.i. the proportion of lung DCs was also significantly lower in aged animals at all infection time points examined. no age-dependent differences in leukocyte numbers or frequency of T and B cells were noted in the tracheobronchial lymph nodes. the percent frequency of total lymph node cells were determined for (G) CD8+ T cells and (H) B cells. Graphs represent average values (+/SE) to further assess age-specific differences in immunity to SARS-CoV infection, the activation status and chemokine receptor profile was assessed. percent frequency of chemokine receptor and activation marker positive leukocytes in SARS-CoV infected aged and juvenile monkeys Frequency of cells a Peripheral blood Day 1 Day 5 Day 10 Juvenile Aged Juvenile Aged Juvenile Aged Statistics Monocytes CCR1 5.0 0.9 1.8 0.4 1.0 0.1 2.2 1.7 2.5 0.3 2.4 0.6 d.p.i* CCR3 1.6 0.4 1.9 04 aAverage frequency of chemokine receptor or activation marker positive cells of total perhipheral blood or lung leukocytes. monocytes (CD14 + HLADR+), peripheral blood dendritic cells (DCs: CD14-HLADR + CD11c+), CD8 T cells (CD3 + CD8+) granzyme B + T cell levels tended to be higher in the peripheral blood of aged compared to juvenile animals, reaching significance at 1 d.p.i. anti-SARS-CoV antibodies were evaluated in the serum and lung. the gating strategy for flow cytometric analysis is shown in Additional file 1: Figures S1 and Additional file 2: Figure S2. Graphs represent average values (+/SE) the elderly are considered the fastest-growing demographic in the united states. we have a poor understanding of the relationship between aging and the host response to respiratory virus infection in humans. we have a poor understanding of the relationship between aging and the host response to respiratory virus infection. we have a poor understanding of the biological changes that occur with aging in humans. flow cytometric results showed significantly reduced CD8 T cells and B cells in aged compared to juvenile monkeys. inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-15, IL-12 and IL-18 were all significantly lower in the lungs of aged animals at either day 5 or 10 post infection. the low cytokine response may also be a reflection of the reduced total inflammatory cell numbers found in the lungs of aged as compared to juvenile animals. cynomolgous macaques were used in the previous study whereas our SARS-CoV infection model utilizes African green monkeys. timing of lung sample collection differed between the two studies, days 2 and 4 were assessed in the cynomolgous macaques. the frequency of costimulatory CD86+ cells was significantly reduced in aged animals compared to juvenile animals in SARS-CoV infection. this corresponded to significantly lower levels of CD8 T cell proliferation at these sites in aged animals as well. aged monkeys had lower frequencies of granzyme + T cells compared to juvenile animals at 5 and 10 d.p.i. despite deficiencies observed in the aged adaptive responses, viral titers were only significantly higher in aged monkeys at day 1 post infection. this suggests that innate or other compensatory immune responses are sufficient for viral control. kine levels and leukocyte frequencies in lung as compared to peripheral blood and tracheobronchial lymph nodes. pulmonary immunity is intrinsically different in the aged as compared to the juvenile host. the estimated age conversion is not as well established for African green monkeys. there is 95% genetic similarity between the two Old World monkey species. all monkeys were quarantined for 6 weeks prior to the study. patients were sacrificed at 5 and 10 d.p.i. by intravenous overdose of Euthasol\u00ae. Virus-free cell culture medium was used to inoculate mock-infected controls. some of the immunology, virology and pathology data for the juvenile animals were previously reported. peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from heparinized blood with a Ficol-Hypaque gradient. flow cytometric analysis was conducted on previously frozen PBMC, lung or lymph node leukocytes. all antibodies were used in 4- or 6- color staining panels. samples were fixed for 16 hr in 1% paraformaldehyde and 3% FBS in phosphate buffered saline. data files were analyzed using FlowJo software 7.6.1 (TreeStar, Medford, OR) similar gates were used across the two different experiments. serially diluted lung tissue homogenate supernatants were incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C. anti-monkey IgG or IgA HRP-conjugated antibody (KPL Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) was applied followed by substrate development with ABTS Microwell peroxidase substrate system (KPL) and absorbance reading at 405 nm using a Thermo Electron Corporation plate reader. IL-2, CCL24 and CCL26 were below the level of detection in lung tissue homogenates. all organs were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution prior to embedding in paraffin. histologic lesions were graded for severity (normal, 1 = minimal, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = marked) two female African green monkeys of 17 yrs and 18 yrs were acquired from the Wake Forest University Primate Center (Medical Center Boulevard, Winston-Salem) the aged African green monkeys in our study are expected to represent approximately, 50 year old humans while the juvenile African green monkeys correspond to 6\u201312 year olds. experimental infection with 107 plaque-forming units (PFU) of SARS-CoV instilled intranasally was conducted as previously reported. monkeys were examined twice per day (at least 6 h apart) on each day of the study for parameters including appetite, appearance, activity, stool, posture, neurological signs, respiration, ocular discharge and nasal discharge. single-cell suspensions for flow cytometry and cytokine protein evaluation were prepared. mechanical and enzymatic digestion with liberase (Roche, Pleasanton, CA) and DNAse (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) solution was performed prior to overlaying samples on a Percoll gradient for 20 min at 500 g with no brake. orochromes FITC, PE, PerCP, PerCpCy5.5, APC, PECy7, Alexa647 or APCCy7 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA unless specified) samples were fixed for 16 hr in 1% paraformaldehyde and 3% FBS in phosphate buffered saline. ELISA plates were coated with purified recombinant SARS-CoV S protein in carbonate-coating buffer (S protein NR-686 obtained through NIH Biodefense and Emerging Infections Research Resources Repository) an anti-monkey antibody was applied followed by substrate development with ABTS Microwell peroxidase substrate system (KPL) data was collected on the Bio-Plex System (BioRad, Hercules, CA) and a weighted logistic curve-fitting method used to calculate the concentration of individual analytes. CD40L was undetectable in serum of either age group and IL-5, TNF-alpha, IL-17, IL-2, CCL24 and CCL26 were below the level of detection. gating strategy for flow cytometric analysis of lung, lymph node and PBMC is illustrated based on PBMC from an aged monkey. first a lymphocyte gate based on forward and side scatter is applied with the percent frequency of total cells indicated in the plot. dendritic cells were defined as CD68 + HLADR + and were evaluated for expression of CD86. CD8 T cells were defined as CD3 + CD8+ and were assessed for expression of intracellular antigens. the percent frequencies of total gated leukocytes based on FSC/SSC are indicated in each plot. regarding the experimental design."}
