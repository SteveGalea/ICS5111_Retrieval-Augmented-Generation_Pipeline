{"summary": "hepatitis C virus (HCV) and malaria parasite Plasmodium both enter the liver through the sinusoids and infect hepatocytes using the two host proteins CD81 and scavenger receptor class B member 1 (SCARB1). CD81 is essential for infection with both pathogens as mice are only susceptible to HCV when expressing human CD81 and blocking CD81 on human hepatocytes impairs P. falciparum infection. the viral nucleocapsid disassembles and releases the viral genome to the cytoplasmic sites of viral genome translation and replication. this is thought to require serum response factor binding protein 1 (SRFBP1), which is recruited to CD81 during HCV entry [20] the steady-state CD81 interaction partners required for HCV entry are largely unknown and demand elucidation. a whole cell proteome expression dataset for human hepatoma cells shows that CAPN5 is strongly associated with CD81. we used a combined proteomics\u2013CRISPR/Cas9 strategy to map CD81 interactions in liver cells. we identified CAPN5 and CBLB as HCV entry facilitators. in contrast expression of hCD81 or hCD81HA in hepatoma cells rendered cells HCV susceptible [26,27]. quantitative proteomics identifies 30 CD81 receptor interactions in hepatoma cells. enriched proteins found in anti-CD81co-IPs from Lunet N hCD81 and Lunet N hCD81HA. we compared enrichment data from endogenous CD81 bait and HA-tagged CD81 bait. we also compared enrichment data from endogenous CD81 bait. the CD81 bait was strongly enriched (2 to 3 orders of magnitude) in all CD81 IPs but not in control IPs. as expected positive (SCARB1) and negative controls (APOL2) showed high and low enrichment. -CD81, ctrl anti-HA, ctrl anti-HA, ctrl anti-CD81, IgG CD166 antigen ALCAM Q13740 2.581 2.203 0.859 0.898 0.776 Annexin A11 ANXA11 P50995 2.535 2.080 0.596 1.204 0.368 Apolipoprotein A-I;Proapolipoprotein A-I;Truncated apolipoprotein 58 Guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit alpha-11 GNA11# P29992 2.123 1.856 0.978 1.905 1.523 Guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit alpha-13 GNA13 Q14344 2.365 1.770 0.722 1.845 1.371 Guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(i) subunit alpha-1 GNAI1 P63096 1.421 0.779 0.179 1.4 P23229 3.054 1.942 0.752 0.964 0.033 Integrin beta-1 ITGB1# P05556 2.596 2.228 1.053 1.818 2.413 Prostaglandin F2 receptor negative regulator PTGFRN Q9P2B2 2.713 1.453 -0.491 2.397 2.615 Poliovirus receptor PVR P15151 1.790 1.576 -0.303 0.962 0.842 Rho-related GTP-binding n.d. n.d. n.d. n.d. n.d. n.d. g(I)/G(S)/G(O) subunit gamma-4 GNG4* P50150 n.d. n.d. n.d. n.d. n.d. n.d. n.d. n.d. n.d. n.d. n.d interaction partners detected in presence of competing soluble CD81 LEL are labeled with +. the enrichment of each protein in the indicated co-IP is listed as median value of four biological replicates. n.d. not detected. we found 29 CD81 interactors in human hepatoma cells. 17 of which are novel CD81 interactors without a previously reported function in CD81 binding or HCV cell invasion. we developed a second LFQ affinity enrichment mass spectrometry (AE-MS) pipeline. ten hits together with 23 hits from the first overlap analysis resulted in 33 high confidence CD81 interactors in primary hepatocytes and hepatoma cells. from this network, we included the closest nine nodes in our hit list for follow up, resulting in a final hit list of 42 proteins. this ensured that putative network proteins poorly amenable to MS identification were still included in subsequent infection assays. Fig 2. Stratification of 33 CD81 receptor interactions in primary human hepatocytes. l = lysate, FT = flow through, E = eluate. a subset of CD81 interacting proteins is required for full HCV infectivity. yellow lines between genes indicate high-confidence (>0.9) STRING interactions. lower confidence (>0.35) STRING interactions are shown as red lines. 81 interactions are required by both pathogens to infect liver cells. we found proteins previously reported as HCV entry facilitators. we investigated human hepatoma cell susceptibility to HCV after silencing each factor. the discovery of CBL and CBLB as HCV host factors is in line with findings showing that ubiquitination events are required in endocytosis and entry of viruses of diverse families including influenza virus and adenoviruses. a similar or distinct set of CD81 PPIs was necessary for hepatoma cell entry of the malaria parasite Plasmodium yoelii. despite the use of CD81 as entry factor by HCV and Plasmodium sporozoites, a distinct subset of CD81 interactors seems to aid entry into liver cells. despite the use of CD81 as entry factor by HCV and Plasmodium sporozoites, a distinct subset of CD81 interactors seems to aid entry into liver cells. infectivity was measured 24 hpi as formation of exoerythrocytic forms by microscopy. Knock down of CD81 significantly decreased P. yoelii infection. CAPN5 and CBLB are cytoplasmic proteins enriched in the CD81 complex. expression level as iBAQ value indicated for the CD81 interactor CAPN5 (red) and the HCV entry factors CD81 (green), SCARB1 (black square), CLDN1 (black hexagon) and OCLN (black diamond) in human hepatoma cells we detected both proteins in intracellular compartments but not exposed to the cell surface. both CAPN5 and CBLB showed a weak co-localization with the plasma membrane expressed protein zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1) with Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients of 0.28 and 0.26 respectively. 72 hpi infection rates were quantified as luciferase activity and normalized to infection rates in cells transduced with a non-targeting scrambled sgRNA. CD81 knockout cells served as positive control. cell lines electroporated with wildtype replicon RNA (JFH1) or a polymerase active site mutant JFH1-GDD (dotted lines) results normalized to the 4 h time point to account for electroporation efficiency. results normalized to the indicated time point to account for electroporation efficiency. we monitored surface expression levels of SCARB1, CD81, CLDN1 and OLCN in CAPN5 and CBLB knockout cells by flow cytometry. neither CAPN5 nor CBLB affected surface expression of SCARB1, CD81, CLDN1 and OLCN on human hepatoma cells. we analyzed whether receptor usage of HCV was impaired by CAPN5 or CBLB. rates through the plasma membrane bypass, while flunarizine reduced infection rates to background levels. this indicates that HCV membrane fusion is not altered by CAPN5 and CBLB and moreover that HCV uncoating is unaffected by CAPN5 and CBLB. human coronavirus (hCoV; strain 229E) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV; strain Indiana) were dispensable for CoV and VSV infection in human hepatoma cells. CAPN5 and CBLB knockout cells were necessary for full infection with all tested HCV genotypes. proline-rich and ubiquitin associating domain (UBA) led to a maximum 1.5-fold increase in HCV infection. this suggests that both proteins have a scaffolding function. CAPN5 and CBLB are HCV-specific, pan-genotypic host factors. non-targeting scrambled sgRNA shown as mean +SEM. data from three independent experiments shown as mean +SEM. infection was quantified 72 hpi by luciferase assay. we used human hepatoma cell lines lacking endogenous CD81. we expressed wildtype or HA-tagged CD81 in these cells. 81 were expressed at the cell surface and in intracellular compartments comparable to endogenous CD81 in human hepatoma cells. expectedly, Lunet N cells lacking CD81 were refractory to infection with HCV and with lentiviruses pseudotyped with HCV glycoproteins. the t-test difference (log10) of CD81 versus control co-IP of 4 biological replicates is plotted against the p value (-log10) of CD81 versus control co-IP of 4 biological replicates is plotted against the p value (-log10). s0 = 2. Proteins significantly enriched are highlighted in dark grey. to map the CD81 PPI network in human hepatoma cells, we performed 64 CD81 co-IPs in quadruplicates from Lunet cells lacking or expressing CD81. on average our mass spectrometric analysis identified 2600 proteins with a false discovery rate (FDR) of 1%. the CD81 bait was strongly enriched (2 to 3 orders of magnitude) in all CD81 IPs but not in control IPs. of the 30 detected hCD81HA interactions, 29 overlapped with the hCD81 interactome (Fig 1F and Table 1). we argued that HCV infection relevant interactions should be preserved for hCD81HA. -0.211 Ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase family member 1;Alkaline phosphodiesterase I;Nucleotide pyrophosphatase ENPP1 P22413 1.610 0.630 0.391 1.694 1.734 Junctional adhesion molecule A F11R Q9Y624 1.693 1.558 1.076 1.488 0.658 Guanine nucleotide-binding protein sub beta-2 GNB2# P62879 1.510 1.319 1.282 1.761 0.782 Integrin alpha-1 ITGA1 P56199 2.334 1.294 0.210 1.782 1.704 Integrin alpha-6;Integrin alpha-6 heavy chain;Processed integrin alpha-6 ITGA6 P23229 3.054 1.942 0.752 0.964 0.033 Integrin beta-1 ITGB1# P05556 2.596 2.228 0.408 0.777 0.778 1.332 E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase CBL-B CBLB* Q13191 n.d. n.d. n.d. n.d. n.d. guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(I)/G(S)/G(O) subunit gamma-4 GNG4* P59768 n.d. n.d. n 0.293 0.327 0.590 SHC-transforming protein 1 SHC1*+ P29353 n.d. n.d. n.d. n.d. n.d. n.d. n.d. n.d. n.d. the tetraspanin and postulated papilloma virus entry factor CD151 and apolipoprotein E were reported HCV entry facilitators. we found 29 CD81 interactors in human hepatoma cells, 17 of which are novel CD81 interactors without a previously reported function in CD81 binding or HCV cell invasion. we performed a second overlap analysis exclusively with the primary hepatocyte hits (>4-fold enrichment) and highly significant hepatoma cell hits (FDR = 0.004, s0 = 2) from cells with untagged CD81. ten \u2018novel\u2019 proteins were also enriched in anti-CD81 co-IPs from CD81HA expressing cells. the LFQ approach and extensive comparison of hepatoma and primary cell datasets elucidated 27 CD81 interactors without a previously reported role in HCV entry or CD81 binding. we defined a stringent set of 42 CD81 interactors in human liver cells. 26 proteins identified in CD81-IPs from PHH donor 1 and 2 and in Lunet N hCD81 cells with high stringency (FDR 0.004). 16 overlapped with analysis in (F), resulting in a total of 33 stringent CD81 interactors in PHH and hepatoma cells. a subset of CD81 interacting proteins is required for full HCV infectivity CD81 is an essential factor for HCV and Plasmodium sporozoite entry into liver cells. as CD81 mediates its molecular functions through PPIs, we hypothesized that a subset of CD81 interactions is required by both pathogens to productively infect liver cells. we found CAPN5 as CD81 interaction partner in hepatoma cells and primary human hepatocytes. we included CBLB as a hit from the STRING network analysis. ubiquitination events are required in endocytosis and entry of viruses. dependent P. berghei sporozoite entry confirms redundant role for CD81 and SCARB1 in P. berghei liver infection. only CD81 was identified as important host factor required for sporozoite entry. sporozoites use CD81, but not CAPN5 or CBLB. hepatoma cells were transfected with a pool of three siRNAs. infectivity was measured 24 hpi as formation of exoerythrocytic forms by microscopy. Knock down of CD81 significantly decreased P. yoelii infection. a large fraction of CAPN5 is associated with CD81 in human hepatoma cells. a subfraction of CAPN5 and CBLB colocalizes with the membrane marker ZO-1. a subfraction of CAPN5 and CBLB colocalizes with the membrane marker ZO-1. Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient for ZO-1 and CAPN5 or CBLB calculated by intensity correlation analysis. each symbol represents an individual frame; horizontal lines indicate the mean SEM. both proteins have multiple cellular component annotations including plasma membrane, cytosol and nucleus. knockout of CD81 almost completely abrogated susceptibility of human hepatoma cells to HCV. PN5 and CBLB support a postbinding step during HCV lipoviroparticle entry. acidification, cold-bound with HCV luciferase reporter virus (JcR-2A; 4\u00b0C, 2 h), shifted to 37\u00b0C (1 h) and washed with a pH 7 buffer to induce artificial plasma membrane fusion. 48 hpi infection rate was quantified as luciferase activity at the indicated time point post electroporation. we assessed HCV receptor expression, receptor usage, virus membrane fusion, uncoating and genome replication in CAPN5 and CBLB knockout cells. Neither CAPN5 nor CBLB affected surface expression of SCARB1, CD81, CLDN1 and OLCN on human hepatoma cells. we fused HCVcc particles at the plasma membrane of CAPN5 and CBLB knockout cells by low pH wash and monitored infection rates. this indicates that HCV membrane fusion is not altered by CAPN5 and CBLB and moreover that HCV uncoating is unaffected by CAPN5 and CBLB. CAPN5 and CBLB are HCV-specific, pan-genotypic entry facilitators. we infected knockout cells with human coronavirus (hCoV; strain 229E) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV; strain Indiana) CAPN5 and CBLB were dispensable for CoV and VSV infection in human hepatoma cells. overexpression of full length CAPN5, the N-terminal protease core domains (PC1 and PC2) or the two C2-like domains (C2L) led to a maximum 1.5-fold increase in basal HCV infection three-fold. this suggests that CAPN5 and CBLB function in HCV entry independent of their enzymatic and signaling functions. infectivity measured 72 hpi as luciferase activity and normalized to infection of Lunet N hCD81 cells transduced with non-targeting scrambled sgRNA. data from three independent experiments shown as mean +SEM. truncated variants of CAPN5 and CBLB were overexpressed in Lunet N hCD81 cells and cells infected with Renilla reporter HCV. infection was quantified 72 hpi by luciferase assay. ephrin receptor signaling, ephrin B signaling, thrombin signaling, and Tec kinase signaling as top four biological pathways. ephrin receptor signaling, ephrin receptor signaling, ephrin B signaling, thrombin signaling, and Tec kinase signaling as top four associated diseases and disorders. the here-defined CD81 interactome can reveal host factors with a role in pathogen invasion in the liver. host factor CBLB is an E3-ubiquitin ligase, which functions together with CBL. this is in line with an E3 ligase activity independent role of CBLB in B cell receptor internalization. CBLB and CBL were not identified as CD81 interacting partners. transient binding of E3 ligases and subsequent targeting of the protein complex to proteasomal degradation hampered detection. our network analysis suggests cellular PPIs engaged by the virus during entry may be linked to tumor development. CAPN5 forms a complex with CD81 and is required for productive HCV uptake CAPN5 is a calcium dependent endopeptidase, which is predicted to regulate protein function. our data points towards a role of CAPN5 and CBLB in guiding endosomal uptake and trafficking to HCV replication competent cytoplasmic compartments. a model in which CBLB and CAPN5 regulate endosomal uptake of HCV\u2013receptor complexes and subsequent routing towards replication competent subcellular compartments. HCV relied on CBL and CBLB, while Plasmodium relied on CBL and the EGFR adaptor protein GRB2. this highlights the versatile follow up of receptor interaction proteomics and demonstrates similarities and differences in use of CD81. this confirms the notion that CD81 interactors like SCARB1 contribute to the narrow tissue tropism of HCV [70] proteomics methods have just in the past decade reached resolution and throughput necessary for systematic analysis of host pathogen interactions. in the future, we may be able to predict how perturbations of such a network by pathogens influences cellular functions. CD81 organizes tyrosine kinase and small G protein signaling networks in the membrane of human liver cells Tetraspanins organize membrane microdomains and signaling platforms in a cell type specific manner. in liver cells only little information on the CD81 guided membrane protein complexes is available and this is reflected by a limited knowledge on endogenous CD81 functions in the liver [15,39]. the two top ranked cellular networks associated with the CD81 interactome in liver cells are cell-to-cell signaling and movement (score 36, 18 focus molecules) and infectious disease (score 16, 10 focus molecules) the analysis suggests a role for CD81 in integrin and G protein coordination as well as TFRC and EGFR signaling. the latter receptors are HCV entry facilitators. EGFR, SHC1, GRB2 and TRFC did not influence HCV susceptibility upon knockdown under the given assay conditions. the RNAi screen may have missed CD81 interacting proteins with a role in HCV or P. yoelii infection. expression of the CD81 interactor and HCV entry facilitator CBLB is altered in gastric and breast tumor tissue. CBLB regulates cell migration and epidermal to mesenchymal transition (EMT) through EGFR degradation. cellular PPIs engaged by the virus during entry may be linked to tumor development. CAPN5 and CBLB regulate an entry step, which is not mimicked by lentiviral pseudoparticles. lentiviruses replicate in the nucleus, while lentiviruses replicate in the nucleus. this model is supported by the notion that endosomal sorting depends on membrane protein\u2013lipid complexes. EGFR associated molecules scored positive for HCV and Plasmodium in the RNA interference screen. HCV relied on CBL and CBLB, while Plasmodium relied on CBL. a very slow disease progression with limited viral spread in the liver reflects this phenotype. future work will clarify the existence of protective protein networks in primary hepatocytes. this confirms the notion that CD81 interactors like SCARB1 contribute to the narrow tissue tropism of HCV.
