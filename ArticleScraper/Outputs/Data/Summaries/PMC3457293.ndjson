{"summary": "influenza A virus belongs to the Orthomyxoviridae family and is classified into A, B, and C types (26) influenza A virus is further categorized into 16 hemagglutinin (HA) and 9 neuraminidase (NA) proteins. each of the influenza A virus subtypes is thought to have originated from waterfowl (23) the TTSP family consists of a number of trypsin-like serine proteases. they are subdivided into the HAT/DESC (differentially expressed in squamous cell carcinoma gene), hepsin/TMPRSS (transmembrane protease, serine 2), matriptase, and corin families (13). a significant proportion of matriptase is thought to be shed from both the basolateral and apical faces of polarized epithelial cells. the membrane form of matriptase is not likely to be involved in HA cleavage in intact epithelia. plasmids encoding the A/WSN/33 (H1N1), A/PR/8/34 (H1N1), and A/California/04/09 (H1N1) HAs were purchased from Sino Biological Inc. pro-UK-pSUMO was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21. pro-UK-pSUMO was grown in 1 liter of Luria broth containing 35 g/ml kanamycin. pro-UK was then eluted with buffer C (50 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl, pH 7.8). 293T cells were grown in polylysine-coated plates and transfected with 1.0 g of each HA-expressing plasmid. the cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and treated with 200 nM matriptase. the HA-expressing cells were washed with PBS and treated with 200 nM matriptase in buffer A for 3 h at 37\u00b0C. the cells were then washed with PBS and treated with HBMSS buffer (5 mM HEPES, 5 mM MES [morpholineethanesulfonic acid], 5 mM succinate, 150 mM NaCl, pH 5.0) resulting viral solutions were incubated for 6 h at 37\u00b0C. peptide mimics of the HA cleavage site by matriptase. each protease along with the peptide mimic was diluted to 50 l. the reaction was carried out for 1 h at 37\u00b0C and monitored for cleavage. the same concentrations of matriptase and each zymogen were incubated alone for 3 h at 37\u00b0C as controls. plasmids encoding the A/WSN/33 (H1N1), A/PR/8/34 (H1N1), and A/California/04/09 (H1N1) HAs were purchased from Sino Biological Inc. plasmin, prekallikrein, and urokinase were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. pro-UK-specific primers were used to amplify the pro-UK gene. pro-UK-pSUMO was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 and grown in 1 liter of Luria broth containing 35 g/ml kanamycin. 293T cells were grown in polylysine-coated plates and transfected with 1.0 g of each HA-expressing plasmid. the cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and treated with 200 nM matriptase in buffer A (20 mM Tris, 10 mM CaCl2, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) HA-expressing cells were washed with PBS and treated with 200 nM matriptase. cells were then washed with PBS and treated with HBMSS buffer. the cells were then washed with PBS and incubated in DMEM for 1 h. the trypsin reaction was stopped by adding 2.5 g trypsin inhibitor (EMD Chemicals) the resulting viral solutions were incubated for 6 h at 37\u00b0C. each protease along with the H1 cleavage site peptide mimic was diluted to 50 l in buffer A to produce a final concentration of 100 M peptide and 20 nM protease. the reaction was carried out for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. the concentration of matriptase was measured by a standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using an anti-matriptase antibody (R&D Systems) coupled with an antimouse secondary antibody (Pierce) RESULTS Presence of secreted matriptase in the human respiratory tract. HA cleavage of the A/PR/8/34, A/New Caledonia/20/99, and A/California/04/09 strains was observed. HA cleavage was also observed to a lesser extent for the A/South Carolina/1/18, A/WS/33, and the A/WSN/33 H1 strains with matriptase treatment. Western blot analysis of HA cleavage from the A/Aichi/2/68, A/Wyoming/3/03, and A/Wisconsin/67/05 (A/WI/05) H3-subtype strains by matriptase. the percent HA cleavage was determined by densitometry of the Western blot shown in Fig. 1. a high degree of syncytium formation was observed with matriptase treatment of the H1 influenza virus A/California/04/09. a lower abundance of syncytia was observed for either the H2 or H3 HA. however, no syncytium formation was observed for either the H2 or H3 HA. matriptase was incubated with the noncleaved virus and subsequently incubated with mammalian cells and assessed for infection by immunofluorescence. infection was not observed with the matriptase-treated A/PR/8/34 virus, which is most likely due to the limited HA cleavage by the protease. fluorogenic peptides of the HA cleavage site region of A/California/04/09 (H1), A/WSN/33 (H2), A/Japan/305/57 (H2), and A/Aichi/2/68 (H3) were designed to determine whether the differences in the amino acid sequence among each subtype affect cleavage by matriptase. the rate of cleavage was determined by monitoring the increase in fluorescence at 390 nm. RFU, relative fluorescence units. Thrombin, urokinase, and plasmin all displayed relatively low activity toward the H1 peptide. in contrast, matriptase displayed a high activity toward the H1 peptide. matriptase has the ability to cleave and activate each protease. in all cases, matriptase efficiently activated the zymogens. matriptase has the ability to both directly and indirectly activate the influenza virus HA. matriptase is a protease capable of activating influenza virus HA by matriptase. mammalian cells expressing HA from six strains of the H1 subtype, one strain of the H2 subtype, and three strains of the H3 subtype were treated with matriptase. sin treatment of HA from each H1 strain resulted in a similar cleavage efficiency. in the case of the H2 subtype, minimal cleavage was observed with matriptase treatment of each strain. matriptase has a strong preference for the H1 subtype, with a preference for particular strains within the H1 subtype. the cleavage efficiency of trypsin and matriptase was determined by densitometry of the Western blot. a high degree of syncytium formation was observed with matriptase treatment of the H1 influenza virus A/California/04/09. blot cleavage analysis shows the specificity of matriptase. cells expressing A/California/04/09 (A/CA/09), A/South Carolina/1/18 (A/SC/18), A/Japan/305/57, and A/Aichi/2/68 were stained with either trypsin or matriptase. matriptase activates influenza virus, a process that is dependent on the HA cleavage efficiency of the protease. the viral nucleoprotein was stained with trypsin and no protease treatment. the cell nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33258 (blue) matriptase cleavage of the HA cleavage site peptide mimic (VPQIESRGL) also resulted in a low rate of cleavage compared to that for the H1 consensus peptide. the rate of cleavage was determined by monitoring the increase in fluorescence at 390 nm. RFU, relative fluorescence units. matriptase showed a high activity toward the H1 peptide. this suggests it is a highly efficient enzyme for HA cleavage. the majority of these proteases are circulating in their inactive form in blood serum. virus HA is synthesized as an inactive precursor that must be cleaved by host proteases to enable fusion with the host endosome. the membrane-bound proteases TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4, and HAT are some of the more recent examples of respiratory tract-localized proteases. matriptase is a protease that is specific for cleavage after an arginine residue. it is found both on the plasma membrane and in the extracellular space of the respiratory tract. TMPRSS2 and HAT that were secreted were shown to be unable to cleave HA (6). matriptase cleavage was limited to the H1 influenza virus subtype, whereas no cleavage was observed with the H2 and H3 subtypes. this finding is distinct from that for other proteases identified in humans, where it is assumed that all human-adapted subtypes are cleaved in an equivalent manner. arginine in the HA cleavage site region can affect proteolytic cleavage (31) matriptase effectively cleaved the peptide mimic of the H1 cleavage site consensus. however, matriptase cleavage was also low for other H1 strains that retain the consensus P-2 serine residue. matriptase cleaved and activated HA from human-adapted influenza virus subtypes. our studies reveal both a subtype and strain specificity. matriptase is the first example of a member within the matriptase TTSP subfamily having the ability to cleave HA."}
