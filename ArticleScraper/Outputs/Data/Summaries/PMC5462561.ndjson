{"summary": "there is no widely accepted, universal definition for acute febrile illness. abrupt-onset illnesses, lasting less than 2 weeks, encompass a wide range of diseases including respiratory tract infections, diarrheal disease, malaria, and other vector-borne diseases which combined cause one-third of all morbidity. despite changing WHO guidelines to give antimalarials only to patients with confirmed malaria, 35\u201358% of smear or rapid diagnostic test negative patients receive antimicrobials in certain settings in an environment of diagnostic uncertainty. rising antimicrobial resistance in resource-limited settings affects antimicrobial effectiveness everywhere. in rural Guinea, 79 people died over 3 months before samples were sent to reference laboratories in france and germany. early detection using rapid diagnostics would reduce disease transmission and outbreak severity. effective diagnostic tools will be essential to demonstrate vaccine efficacy and provide surveillance for outbreaks to most efficiently guide vaccine deployment. the Sensititre MYCOTB MIC Plate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) is preconfigured with lyophilized antibiotics. it can perform drug susceptibility testing for Mycobacterium tuberculosis faster than conventional methods. standard bacterial culture 92% agreement No 62 Microtiter plates TB drug susceptibility on Middlebrook agar 92% agreement Yes 63 ELISA = enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; Ref = reference; RLS = resource-limited setting; TB = tuberculosis. technology has been developed to use smartphones to accurately read results of serologic tests. recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) use alternative cocktails of enzymes to accomplish same goal of replicating pathogen DNA or RNA for detection without the need to quickly vary temperature as required for PCR. is Gl pathogens Ebola Alere i Alere Nicking endonuclease amp 15 FilmArray influenza 79 100 8,628 94 78,79 FilmArray BioFire Nested multiplex RT-PCR 65 Ebola PCR 83 97 40,000 109 80\u201384 Genedrive Epistem Multiplex RT-PCR 45\u201375 TB culture 45 98 NCA NCA 85,86 GeneXpert Cepheid Heminested RT- RT-PCR is real-time polymerase chain reaction; Spec = specificity; TB = tuberculosis; Tech = Technologies. most isothermal NAAT still require laborious sample preparation by skilled technicians and at times nuanced interpretation of results. the Alere isothermal instrument costs $8,628 and each kit $94.79. current walkaway PCR systems are far out of reach for diagnosis of acute febrile illness in resource-limited settings. arboviruses include multiple offerings for a multiplex dengue, chikungunya, and Zika assay. advances in molecular biology are allowing for increasingly multiplex detection strategies. advances in each individual component are paving the way for a future in which such a device will surely be surely available. many infectious diseases do not release pathogen genetic material in sufficient quantities to be diagnosed by NAAT using blood or serum samples. new approaches to use NAAT to detect a host RNA expression signature in lieu of pathogen nucleic acids may circumvent these limitations. a decade ago, the WHO ASSURED criteria challenges developers to produce ideal point-of-care diagnostic tests for resource-limited settings. disposable paper-based lateral flow diagnostics have no infrastructure requirements, require minimal training, and do not break. accelerated technologic innovation has led to rapid breakthroughs in NAAT. improvements in traditional serologic and culture techniques, imaging devices, and next-generation sequencing as tools for infectious disease diagnosis."}
