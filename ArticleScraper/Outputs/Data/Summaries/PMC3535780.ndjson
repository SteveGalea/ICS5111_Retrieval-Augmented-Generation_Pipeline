{"summary": "cats can also be infected with (H1N1) pdm09 human influenza A virus (5, 6) no serological or etiological studies about pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza A virus infections have been carried out in cats in china. ELISAs can detect antinucleoprotein antibodies based on competition principles. HI titers 40 are considered to represent seropositivity and to indicate previous infection. a total of 415 serum samples collected in 2006 had no HI and NP ELISA antibodies against a/Guangdong/1057/2010. a total of 415 serum samples collected in 2006 had no HI and NP ELISA antibodies against a/Guangdong/1057/2010. seroepidemiological study was conducted in southern china. 13 of 1,080 sera were found positive by NP-specific ELISA in different cat populations in southern china. the most likely route of free-roaming cats infection is human-to-cat transmission. the data thus suggest that transmission occurred, most probably by close contact, between pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza A virus-infected owners and their pets in recent years. to compare the results of seroepidemiological investigations among cats living in southern china that are infected."}
