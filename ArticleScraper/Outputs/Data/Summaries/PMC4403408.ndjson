{"summary": "human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading viral cause of severe respiratory infection during infancy and early childhood and among immunocompromised populations (1, 2). globally, the virus is estimated to be responsible for 30 million episodes of acute lower respiratory tract infections (RTIs) and more than 50,000 deaths annually in children under 5 years of age. the G protein together with the fusion protein are important targets of human protective antibody responses (8, 15), with changes in this region thought to be driven by pressure to avoid host immune responses. advances in primer design, sequencing technology, and sequence assembly algorithms now allow full-genome sequencing for a number of viruses. the 33-nt sequences were then trimmed to a calculated melting temperature (Tm) of 58\u00b0C, discarding sequences mapping to human rRNA. all sequences were mapped to an RSVA or RSVB reference strain. the two most frequent primers mapping within 300 nt of the end of each amplicon were selected.

PCR primers were selected from all available RSVA and RSVB genomic sequence data based on frequency, location, and predicted PCR function. PCR products of the expected size obtained for all 6 amplicons are shown in Fig. 1A. the 27 Kilifi genomes were combined with RSVA and RSVB genomes from 16 countries from specimens collected between the years 1981 and 2013. RSVA forms 3 major clades: GA1 (including strains only from the united states), GA5 (with U.S. and global strains), and a clade with both GA2 and the ON1 viruses. four clades were designated for the RSVB genomes, with BA containing the majority of the Kilifi sequences. Clade GB1_GB4 included viruses detected in the united states between 1983 and 1991. Clades SAB1, GB3 and BA included viruses from multiple countries. each panel represents a genome nucleotide alignment of RSVs that had identical G gene sequences. the vertical lines indicate where there are nucleotide substitutions occurring outside the G gene region between the genomes. the blue blocks indicate a gap in the sequence. the two regions considered for vaccine targets, G and F, show a strikingly wide difference in rate. an important consideration for vaccine development is how representative a vaccine strain is for locally circulating viruses. the transmission patterns of a virus, the evolutionary rate of the virus, and patterns of human movement can influence how quickly global strains reach a rural location. changes in NS2 protein were determined and are depicted as in panel A. changes in NS2 protein were determined and are depicted as in panel A. d The P value for Fisher's exact test was 0.05 for the number of location-specific distinct changes compared to total distinct changes for RSVA versus RSVB. 80% of the observed changes in the RSVA G protein were also found globally, while the Kilifi RSVB viruses showed a higher degree of local evolution. RSVA-GA2 group showed a frequent change in two predicted glycosylation sites. in the RSVB viruses, 3 of 15 amino acid changes involve asparagine. however, none of these changes are within predicted glycosylation sites. the majority of changes in the Kilifi RSVA NS2 proteins were observed in other parts of the world. however, the RSVB NS2 protein showed a significantly high degree of variation only observed in the Kilifi viruses. RSVA forms 3 major clades: GA1 (including strains only from the united states), GA5 (with U.S. and global strains), and a clade with both GA2 and the ON1 viruses. four clades were designated for the RSVB genomes. Clade GB1_GB4 included viruses detected in the united states between 1983 and 1991. the 4 viruses within clade GB3 (3 from Kilifi and 1 from Germany) lacked the 60-nucleotide duplication. each panel represents a genome nucleotide alignment of RSVB genomes with identical G gene sequences. the vertical lines indicate where there are nucleotide substitutions occurring outside the G gene region between the genomes. the blue blocks indicate a gap in the sequence. vated changes in G and M2-2 were observed previously using RSV full genomes from U.S. and European cohort data (21). the whole-genome estimates for the evolutionary rates showed narrower confidence intervals than those from the individual ORFs. the two regions considered for vaccine targets, G and F, show a strikingly wide difference in rate, and this may be important for selecting conserved vaccine targets. changes in NS2 protein were determined and are depicted as in panel A. Known motifs of the NS2 protein include signal peptide (SP), heptad repeat C (HRC), 27-mer fragment (p27), putative fusion peptide (FP), heptad repeat A (HRA), domains 1 and 2 (Dom1&2), heptad repeat B (HRB), transmembrane domain (TM), and cytoplasm fish's exact test was 0.05 for the number of location-specific distinct changes compared to total distinct changes for RSVA versus RSVB. a large percentage of changes observed in the RSVA G protein were also observed globally, with 88% of the changes seen in Kilifi RSVA G also observed in other parts of the world. nearly half of the observed changes in the in G protein affect S, T, or P residues. this is apparent when potential N- and O-linked glycosylation sites are marked on the G protein region. an N237D polymorphism observed in many of the viruses is within the site NTT and would remove a predicted N-linked glycosylation site. the NS2 showed an elevated level of evolutionary rate. the majority of changes in the RSVA NS2 proteins were observed in other parts of the world. however, the RSVB NS2 protein showed a significantly high degree of variation only observed in the Kilifi viruses. the 27 novel Kilifi RSV genomes (11 RSVA and 16 RSVB) generated in this study were used to assess local versus global RSV variety. phylogenetic clustering appeared to be more influenced by time of virus sample collection than by geographical location. similarity of overall topology of phylogenetic trees from whole genomes and G sequences is encouraging. nucleotide substitution in the RSV genome in the short term is random, i.e., not concentrated in the regions that appear the most variable in the long term. the observed sites of change in the G and F proteins were frequently in exposed regions of the proteins. several involved glycosylation site changes suggestive of immune evasion."}
