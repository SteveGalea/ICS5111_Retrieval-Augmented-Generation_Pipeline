{"summary": "glycan microarray analysis of 52SFK with 128 different sialylated glycans. strong binding signals were observed with 52SFK for a group of linear -2,8-linked oligoSia. this binding was much greater than for -2,3- and -2,6-linked sialic acids. HAdV-5 (5FK) and HAdV-52 long fiber (52LFK) bound efficiently to polySia. HAdV-52 is able to interact preferentially with polySia via the knob domain of its short fiber. HAdV-52 SFK binds to polySia in human cells expressing (SH-SY5Y) or lacking (SK-N-SH) polySia. Flow cytometry-based quantification of HAdV FK binding to human neuroblastoma cells. binding lectins to evaluate the relative levels of glycans with terminal sialic acids on the two cell lines to exclude the possibility that the higher 52SFK binding to SH-SY5Y was due to a higher level of glycans with terminal monosialic acids on these cells. all three lectins tested, Maackia amurensis I and II (MAL I and II; binds to -2,3-linked Sia); Sambu OligoSia effectively reduces HAdV-52 virion binding to and infection of SH-SY5Y cells. binding of soluble monosialic acid (DP1) or pentasialic acid (DP5) was performed three times with duplicate samples. oligoSia glycans (DP3, -4, or -5) as well as the GD3 glycan (Neu5NAc2,8Neu5NAc2,3Gal1,4Glc, representing a disialic acid motif) all complex structures produced similar results. well-defined electron density was found only for a single sialic acid moiety in the canonical binding pocket in all cases. the experiment showed saturation transfer occurring almost exclusively at the nonreducing end. the other moieties received only a very moderate spin saturation occurring exclusively in the N-acetyl group region. in the case of the R316A mutant, saturation transfer was completely abrogated. a length of more than three sialic acid residues is required for a strong interaction with 52SFK. a DP of 3 was sufficient to substantially decrease 52SFK binding at low concentration in solution. similar results were acquired from surface plasmon resonance experiments with immobilized FKs and oligoSia. polySia glycan is unlikely to enhance affinity for polySia. we performed an MD simulation of the complex between 52SFK and DP5. DP5 shows a flexible structure with dynamic partial helical features (Movie S1) colominic acid is only moderately more potent than DP5 given the size difference. the sialic acids display an alternating pattern of transient interactions. there are most of the time at least two pyranoses that directly interact with the protein. trasialic acid (DP4), pentasialic acid (DP5), and polySia (DP 80\u2013100) were simulated over a time of 2 s. the interaction profile of DP5 with the protein is mapped onto 52SFK in a \u201cheat map\u201d style. simulated binding pockets shown from a top view. amino acids of the canonical binding site are boxed in pink, and residues of the steering rim in orange. 349A mutant almost completely lost its cell binding capacity. the residue R321 can no longer counterbalance the charge of the proximal side chain of E348, which then likely repels the polyanionic polySia. this implies that R321 interacts more weakly with polySia than R316 and K349 do. no other HAdV FK with known structure exhibits a comparable steering rim. the 52SFK likely serves as a purely Sia-binding FK. the disordered strand is thought to obstruct the electropositive patch on the side (57), making a Sia interaction unlikely. pancy between SH-SY5Y and SK-N-SH cells indicates a more specific interaction of 52SFK with polySia rather than a general high binding to both cell lines. simian (S) and human AdV SFK binding to polySia-expressing/lacking cells is seen for SAdV-7SFK. the neoglycolipid probe (50) is a result of the reductive amination procedure. this suggests that the high-affinity interaction with 52SFK requires at least three intact -2,8-linked sialic acid residues. we analyzed the binding of recombinant knob domains from HAdV-52 short fiber, HAdV-37 fiber (37FK) and HAdV-52 long fiber (52LFK) numerical scores for the binding intensity are shown as means of fluorescence intensities of duplicate spots at 5 fmol/spot. DP5\u2013DP9 = -2,8-linked sialic acids with a degree of polymerization (DP) between 5 and 9 (from left to right, in steps of 2). the levels of polySia on these cells were confirmed by flow cytometry using the anti-polySia antibody mAb735 (Fig. S1). the levels of polySia on these cells were confirmed by flow cytometry using the anti-polySia antibody mAb735 (Fig. S1). binding to SH-SY5Y cells up to 75%, while no effect was observed on 37FK binding. oligoSia (DP5) also reduced binding to and infection of SH-SY5Y cells. HAdV-52 virions show a clear preference for polySia-expressing cells. we previously identified a sialic acid-binding site on the lateral side of 52SFK (23) this binding site includes a stretch of three adjacent residues that together form a prominent RGN motif. the features responsible for the increased affinity for polySia are unknown, and it seems plausible that additional contacts or an additional epitope are formed between 52SFK and polySia. alic acid moiety does not seem to contribute any direct contacts in the overall interaction, except for a van der Waals contact between its N-acetyl group and E328. this contact seems to cause a local decrease of electron density and a slight rotation of the N-acetyl group. the third (and all following) sialic acids could not be unambiguously traced in any of the structures. the nonreducing sialic acid moiety is colored in yellow, and the adjacent moiety in green. the third sialic acid moiety could not be resolved. the positions of distinctive protons for NMR are indicated. SFK revealed a positively charged rim located around the sialic acid binding site. the rim is mainly formed by residues Q320, R321, R316, and K349. the polyanionic polySia seems to at least transiently adopt a left-handed helical conformation. the moieties toward the reducing end show a much more variable interaction pattern with low occupancies for individual contacts. the dimensions of DP5 are similar to the combined radius of the binding pocket and steering rim. colominic acid is only moderately more potent than DP5 given the size difference. the results from MD simulations should be taken with some caution. a DP of 3 strengthens the interactions with 52SFK. the experiment was performed three times with duplicate samples in each experiment. three pentasialic acid molecules interacting with the three identical binding pockets of 52SFK were simulated over a time of 2 s. the interaction profile of DP5 with the protein is mapped onto 52SFK in a \u201cheat map\u201d style. the number of favorable atom contacts and hydrogen bonds per residue is averaged over the three binding sites. boxing of the amino acid residues is analogous to C and D; sialic acids are boxed in gray. we produced FKs with mutations in the steering rim and analyzed knob binding to polySia-expressing SH-SY5Y cells. dV-19 (SAdV-C), which acquired its short fiber from an unknown type/species, is not found in any other known nonhuman or human AdV. dV-40 and -41 (HAdV-F) are functionally conserved in these SAdV types, but in different permutations (RRK, RKK, RRR) another functionally important residue is Q320. all of the examined short knobs except that of SAdV-2 SFK bound better to polySia-expressing cells than to the control cell line. a possible explanation for the inability of SAdV-2 SFK to bind polySia could be that this knob harbors a sequence more distantly related to the other knobs. polySia was identified as a potential receptor for 52SFK by glycan microarray screening. the topology of the polySia binding site of HAdV-52 allows it to maintain a large pool of glycan ligands while developing increased affinity for a specific subset of surface molecules. monosialylated and disialylated glycans are still able to interact with the knob with lower affinities. but long-range electrostatic and transient polar interactions enable higher-affinity binding of oligosialic acids with a higher DP (DP 3). in humans, it is unknown in which contexts HAdV-52 might encounter polySia for cell attachment. HAdV-52, a naturally occurring, unmodified HAdV that already binds polySia, could form the basis for a viable alternative strategy for developing oncolytic vectors. the specificity for polySia can be increased further by mutating K349 to an arginine."}
