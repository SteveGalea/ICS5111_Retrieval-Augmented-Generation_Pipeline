{"summary": "coVs are enveloped and single-stranded plus-sense RNA viruses that cause a variety of diseases among many different species. coVs enter cells through the interactions of the viral S proteins with host receptors. heptad repeat domains are called the N-terminal and C-terminal heptad repeats, HR-N and HR-C. the juxtamembrane domain (JMD) and a transmembrane domain (TMD) fusion proteins generally contain one FP, located either internally, like the FPs of the glycoprotein (GP) of Ebola virus and the envelope protein (Env) of avian sarcoma leukosis virus (21\u201324), or immediately downstream of the \u201cpriming\u201d site. most are rich in Ala and/or Gly, have an intermediate level of hydrophobicity with membrane binding potential. HEK-293, 293T, HEK-293 cells stably expressing hACE2 (293/hACE2), HeLa cells stably expressing mouse CEACAM1a (HeLa/mCEACAM1a) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2% penicillin-streptomycin-amphotericin B (Fungi a plasmid encoding full-length human hACE2 (pACE2-cq) was purchased from Sino Biological Inc. (Beijing, China) to express soluble human ACE2 (shACE2) and soluble human DPP4 (shDPP4), residues 1 to 236 of mCEACAM1a with C-terminal 6His and AVI tags were cloned into EcoRI and NotI of pFASTBac cells were incubated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) plus 1 mM EDTA. after washing, cells were incubated with the respective primary anti-S antibody for 1 h on ice. ted with mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody (1:1,000 dilution) for shACE2, followed by Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:200) and rabbit polyclonal anti-AVI antibody (1:200 dilution) cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde and analyzed by flow cytometry. transduction efficiency was monitored by quantitation of luciferase activity. all experiments were done in triplicate and repeated at least three times. hek 293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant S proteins by using PEI. the -actin and HIV capsid protein (p24) were detected using mouse monoclonal anti-actin antibody (1:5,000) and rabbit polyclonal anti-p24 antibody (1:5,000) the following day, 293T cells were lifted with trypsin and overlaid onto receptor-expressing cells at a ratio of approximately one S-expressing cell to two receptor-expressing cells. cells were lysed by adding 120 l of medium with an equal volume of Steady-Glo. luciferase activity was measured with a Modulus II microplate reader. all peptides were synthesized using a standard solid-phase FMOC (9-fluorenylmethoxy carbonyl) method. CD spectra were acquired on a jasco J-815 spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan) using a 1-nm bandwidth with a 1-nm step resolution from 195 to 260 nm at room temperature. spectroscopy was performed to study the secondary structure of fusion peptides in increasing trifluoroethanol concentrations. the final lipid concentration was 300 M. the initial residual fluorescence of the labeled and unlabeled vesicles was set up. pcDNA-SARS-CoV S19 (36), pcDNA-MERS-CoV S16 (37), and pcDNA-MHV S (38) have been described previously. plasmid encoding full-length human DPP4 (pcDNA-hDPP4) was purchased from Sino Biological Inc. (Beijing, China) residues 40 to 766 of human hACE2 with N-terminal 6His and FLAG tags and residues 40 to 766 of human DPP4 with C-terminal 6His and AVI tags were cloned between SalI and HindIII. residues 1 to 236 of mCEACAM1a with C-terminal 6His and AVI tags were cloned into EcoRI and NotI of pFASTBac1 vector with cells were stained with 1% paraformaldehyde and analyzed by flow cytometry. HEK-293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant S proteins with PEI. after 40 h, cells were lifted with PBS plus 1 mM EDTA. plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant S proteins were cotransfected into 293T cells with pLenti-Luc-green fluorescent protein (GFP) and psPAX2 (Addgene, Cambridge, MA) the following day, the cells were fed with fresh medium. the virion-containing supernatant was pelleted through a 20% sucrose cushion at 30,000 rpm at 4\u00b0C for 2 h in a Beckman SW41 rotor. cell lysates and pseudovirion pellets were separated on a 4 to 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose blot. the blots were stained with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies goat anti-rabbit IgG trypsin overlaid on a 70% confluent monolayer of 293/hACE2, HeLa/hDPP4 or HeLa/mCEACAM1a cells at a ratio of approximately one S-expressing cell to two receptor-expressing cells. after overnight incubation, images of syncytia were captured with a Nikon TE2000 epifluorescence microscope running MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices) an Ahx-KKK linker was added to all peptides used in CD spectroscopy analysis to increase peptide solubility in PBS. the following peptides were used for the lipid mixing study: CTRL, KWGQYTNSPFLTKGF-Ahx-KKK. liposomes were extruded 21 times through two stacked polycarbonate membranes. liposomes were mixed with unlabeled liposomes at a ratio of 1:9. the final lipid concentration was 300 M. unlabeled vesicles were set up as the baseline for 0% fluorescence value (f0); 100% fluorescence value (f100) was achieved by addition of Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 0.2%. the extent of lipid mixing was calculated using a formula: %ft = (ft f0)/(f100 f0) 100, where ft is the fluorescence value observed after addition of fusion peptide at time the primary amino acid sequences of this region were not conserved in all of the CoVs studied. they were all Ala or Gly rich, relatively hydrophobic, and contained no charged residues. we named this region in CoV S proteins the possible FP (pFP) I955G/V958G, G959A, G959R, W960G, W960R, V958G/W960G, T961A, A962V, A962R, G963A, G963R, L961G/L952G, S965R, S966R, F967G, L964F/F967G, A968R, A969V, A969, I97 the amount of wild-type S protein on cell surfaces was set as 100%. all of the experiments shown were repeated at least three times. +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ A962V +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ ++ ++ ++ ++ ++ ++ ++ ++ ++ ++ ++ ++ ++ ++ ++ ++ ++ ++ ++ ++ ++ ++ ++ ++ ++ ++ ++ 76R +++ ND +++ ND L876G +++ +++ +++ +++ ++ +++ MHV wild type +++ +++ +++ MHV wild type +++ +++ +++ M963R + +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ M963R + +++ +++ +++ +++ +++ P938R ++ ++, strong; +, weak; +, weak;, absent. d cell-cell fusion and pseudovirion mutants with defects in S protein expression and processing also showed only low levels of S proteins on the cell surface. mutants with defects in S protein expression and processing also showed only low levels of S proteins on the cell surface. pFP mutations may affect S protein binding to its cognate receptor, hDPP4. syncytium formation depended on the availability of hDPP4. 14 mutants induced large syncytia in HeLa/hDPP4 cells. these 13 residues in MERS-CoV S protein are critical for S protein-mediated, receptor-dependent membrane fusion that would lead to virus. fusion of 293T cells with HeLa/hDPP4 cells increased luciferase activity by 1,000-fold. pFP mutants retained 50 to 110% of WT-level fusion activity. 14 mutants reduced S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion by more than 85%. cell-cell fusion was quantified by measurement of luciferase activities. luciferase activities from cell-cell fusion induced by wild-type S protein were over 107. the reading for the mock control was less than 1,000. 8G/W960G, T961G, A962R, and L964R almost abolished MERS-CoV S protein-mediated, receptor-dependent pseudovirion entry. this suggests that S954, I955, G957, V958, W960, T961, A962, and L964 are essential for virus entry. the pFP of most class I viral fusion proteins fold predominantly in an -helix structure in the presence of TFE. a scrambled peptide from a previous SARS-CoV study was chosen as the negative control. the FP of HIV-1 was selected as the positive control (46) all peptides were dissolved in PBS, and their CD spectra were measured in the presence of the indicated concentration of TFE. the extent of lipid mixing was determined by monitoring changes in fluorescence intensity at 535 nm at 37\u00b0C upon addition of peptide. mutant FP (mFP) failed to induce any noticeable lipid mixing. resulting mutant mFP (mFP) failed to induce any noticeable lipid mixing. we also investigated the functional role of the pFPs of other CoVs. I878 mutants (I878G, I878R, and the double mutant L876G/I878G) were expressed slightly less well in cell lysates. all Arg mutations in pFP of SARS-CoV effectively abolished S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion and virus entry. the double mutant W868G/F870G abolished S protein-mediated virus entry. protein of SARS-CoV (B) or MHV (E) was detected using rabbit polyclonal anti-SARS S1 antibody. MHV S protein was detected using goat polyclonal anti-MHV S antibody AO4, and p24, a gag protein of HIV, was detected using rabbit polyclonal anti-p24 antibodies. experiments were repeated at least three times, and one representative is shown. proteolytic priming is one of the early essential steps required to activate the fusion potential of class I viral fusion proteins. the proteolytic priming sites for most of the class I viral fusion proteins are either immediately proximal to or not far upstream of the viral FP. therefore, identifying the key proteolytic priming site may lead to discovery of a viral FP. however, in the case of coVs, the priming sites are less clear. pFP region is flanked by YT at the N terminus and PF at the C terminus. pFP region is located at about 7 to 23 amino acids upstream of the N terminus of HR-N of CoV S proteins. this region is essential for S protein-mediated syncytium formation and virus entry. idues close to the C terminus of the pFP of the SARS-CoV S protein also appear to be important for S protein folding. replacement of I878 with R or G also decreased S protein expression and incorporation into virions. this region might also be important for membrane fusion mediated by S protein. if the FP and TMD of CoV S protein interact with each other during membrane fusion remains to be determined. there is a GXXXG or (small)XXX(small) motif (G, Gly; small, Ala, Gly, or Ser; X, any residue) present in all of the pFPs of CoVs. these motifs were initially discovered in human glycophorin A. pFPs of different lineages of -CoVs appear to be better conserved. coV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase error, recombination, and selective pressure during evolution likely contribute to these changes. lack of conservation of the pFP amino acid sequences is not unique for CoVs. GG and PP motifs favor the formation of turn or hairpin structures. the FP from group 2 influenza virus HA also lacks a central GG or PP motif. a similar motif is also present in the pFPs of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. further molecular biological, biochemical, and biophysical analyses showed that this region is essential for receptor-dependent membrane fusion mediated by S proteins of several -CoVs in different lineages. findings will provide significant clues for future studies of the membrane fusion mechanism of CoVs."}
