{"summary": "a seemingly archaic and oft-overlooked reason is that disease epidemics have vast implications on national survival. in 2011, the airport handled a record 46.5 million passengers, a 10.7% increase over 2010's 42 million. in the course of 47 years of nation building, its total population has grown from a mere two million in 1970 to five million in 2010. in this article, we share an epidemiological perspective to Singapore's experience safeguarding its population against the onslaught of novel diseases. we suggest the circumstances that condition its set of disease control measures may not be entirely unique. compared to the economic recession in 1997-1998 and 2001, the SARS crisis had the deepest, albeit short-lived impact on visitor arrivals. by April 2003, visitor arrivals dropped 67% and caused a ripple effect on business activities. the widespread dissemination of the novel influenza A (H1N1) in 2009 was thought to be related to the high number of flights out of early major centres of the epidemic. Singapore's population density has more than doubled from 3.5 thousand population per square km in 1970 to 7.1 thousand population per square km in 2010 [21] in ecological terms, Singapore's rapid urbanization has resulted in an increasingly built environment with new dynamic interactions between niches that are natural (biosphere) and man-made (technosphere) this in turn leads to emerging health concerns peculiar to an urbanized built environment. chikungunya, a mosquito-borne viral disease, surfaced in 2008. the first three local episodes were most likely the result of independent importations of the virus from neighbouring Asian countries. locally acquired cases that occurred around July in the same year were due to a single strain which was closely related to the strain detected in cases imported from Malaysia. a new variable that may amplify disease transmission is climate change. extreme weather events may augur unfavourably for mid- to long-term infrastructural planning. extreme weather events are indicatory of an upset ecological system. agri-food and veterinary authority increased surveillance of food imports to ensure consumption safety. this is compounded by the flagrant use of antibiotics and pesticides, mass production of processed food items, high ambient temperatures, and an extensive farm-to-fork process. the national pastime of exotic dining outside the home needs only small mentioning. the first cohort comprising ten trainees will be graduating in July 2012. the programme aims to build a cadre of field specialists who can lead and support the public health mission. the school aims to produce future public health leaders."}
