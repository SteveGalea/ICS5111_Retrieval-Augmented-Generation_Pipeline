{"summary": "the order of Nidovirales includes four virus families: Roniviridae, Arterividae, Mesoniviridae, and Coronaviridae. they have the largest known viral RNA genomes and infect a wide range of hosts. their virions are 60\u201380 nidovirales. the yellow head virus (YHV) can cause economic losses to the shrimp industry. in recent years, veterinarians have become very concerned about arterividae. the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is causing economic losses to the swine industry. oviruses bind to cell surface receptors, an event that precedes the fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. the fusion takes place either at the plasma membrane or in the endosomes and releases the nucleocapsid into the host cell cytoplasm [19,22] after genomic RNA uncoating from the nucleocapsid, two large replicase open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1a and ORF1b, are translated by newly formed virions then egress the host cell through secretion via the exocytic pathway. infection starts with the binding of the viral particle to a cell surface receptor and subsequent cell entry through membrane fusion in endosomes upon endocytosis. autophagy and the autophagy-related proteins are grouped all catabolic pathways. autophagy is conserved among eukaryotes that allows the turnover of excess or damaged cellular components. autophagy is characterized by double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes. autophagy is regulated by several signaling cascades. the proteins encoded by the ATG genes have been classified in five functional groups. the unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase (ULK) kinase complex, the class III hVPS34 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex and the ATG9 cycling system play a key role in the initiation of autophagy and phagophore formation. ubiquitination-like systems recruit members of the LC3/ATG8 protein family onto autophagosomal membranes. the fusion of autophagosomes first with endosomes and then with lysosomes leads to the formation of amphisomes and autolysosomes. this compendium will focus on the documented viruses in the Arterivirus and Coronavirus families (summarized in Table 1). Table 1. Summary of the current knowledge on autophagy contribution over the course of Arteriviruses and Coronaviruses infections. the equine arteritis virus causes abortions in 10\u201350% of the sows. equine arteritis virus causes fever and anorexia leading to death of 5\u201310% of them. equine arteritis virus infects horses and donkeys. the virus titer in infected cells treated with rapamycin was higher than in the control. intracellular levels of PRRSV N protein or nsp2 assessed by flow cytometry were lower. this latter result is the opposite of those obtained by the other studies where rapamycin treatment led to an up-regulation of nsp2 expression. confocal microscopy and fractionation suggest that the accumulated autophagosomes during PRRSV could represent the replicative platforms. apoptosis and autophagy activation in piglets infected with the HP PRRSV strain could induce apoptosis in bystander cells and autophagy in both infected and bystander cells. co-immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy experiments revealed the formation of a BAD-BECLIN1 complex in infected cells. the authors concluded that the enhancement of autophagy could promote PRRSV replication by postponing apoptosis through the formation of the BAD-BECLIN1 complex. onaviruses are the Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus (TGEV) and Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDV) both infect suckling piglets and lead to a high mortality rate. despite their medical and veterinary relevance, the exact mechanisms of alpha-CoV replication and pathogenesis are not well characterized yet. two more recent studies have addressed the link between autophagy and TGEV replication but they have reached opposite conclusions. they both demonstrated that autophagy is induced in TGEV-infected cells using methods such as TEM, LC3 puncta formation and western blot analysis of both LC3 lipidation and SQSTM1/p62 degradation. authors also found that TGEV N protein and GFP-LC3 localize to mitochondria. expression in ST cells promoted TGEV replication, showing that autophagy has an antiviral function. the apparent discrepancies between these two studies could be explained by the use of different TGEV strains (SHXB versus H165) and/or cell lines (IPEC-J2 versus ST) atg5/ knockout cells did not observe any effect on MHV life cycle in absence of ATG5 [65,66] the fact that MHV infection does not require intact ATG machinery was also later confirmed by another group using atg7/ MEFs. data from both laboratories established that the viral RTCs are co-localizing with endogenous LC3 but not ectopically expressed GFP-LC3. EDEMosomes are decorated with non-lipidated from of LC3 (also called LC3-I) and their formation might require selected components of the ATG machinery, such as ATG5. expression of a non-lipidable LC3 impaired DMVs biogenesis and viral replication, but absence of EDEM1 and OS-9 had no effect. authors hypothesize that one or more nsp proteins might associate with components of the machinery of EDEMosomes. autophagy stimulation could be part of a cellular response caused by the presence of toxic exogenous proteins or ER stress induced by the massive production of viral proteins [89,90,91]. nsp3 fragments derived from several CoV induce autophagy through direct binding to LC3 and BECLIN1 [92]. nsp6 from MHV and SARS-CoV also induced GFP-LC3 puncta formation. this suggests that the nsp6-dependent mechanism for autophagy induction might be conserved among CoVs. the equine arteritis virus, in contrast, infects horses and donkeys. infected cells showed the presence of a higher number of autophagosome-like double-membrane vesicles, an accumulation of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-LC3-positive puncta and higher levels of lipidated LC3. induction of bulk autophagy with rapamycin (mTOR inhibitor) resulted in an enhancement of viral replication. a decrease in the virus titer in cells treated with bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) showed that the HP PRRSV infection inhibits the fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes. this result indicates that PRRSV might trigger an incomplete autophagy and implicates that this could be beneficial for the virus life cycle. the HP PRRSV strain leads to thymic atrophy and thymocyte apoptosis. they previously showed that this virus leads to thymic atrophy and thymocyte apoptosis [61]. a follow-up study found that HP PRRSV replication was attenuated in autophagy deficient cells and potentiated by inhibiting apoptosis using z-VAD-fmk, a caspas the enhancement of autophagy could promote PRRSV replication by postponing apoptosis through the formation of the BAD-BECLIN1 complex [64]. monastyrska et al. found that the DMVs induced by this virus are decorated with LC3 but the EAV life cycle proceeded unaffected in cells lacking ATG7 [68]. sun et al. recently performed a high throughput mass spectrometry analysis in PEDV-infected Vero cells. they found that autophagy might be among the altered pathways as sequestrosome 1 and LC3 expression levels were upregulated. a subsequent study thus focused on the potential interplay between autophagy and PEDV. a reduced mitochondrial mass, a light oxidative stress, and mitochondria in autophagosome-like vesicles. authors also found that TGEV N protein and GFP-LC3 localize to mitochondria. induction of mitophagy by mitochondria depolarization using carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone increased the viral titer, suggesting that this pathway might be beneficial for viral replication. the genus beta-CoV also includes the highly pathogenic human viruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. MHV replication takes place on interconnected structures formed by convoluted membranes and DMVs. the latter is reminiscent of autophagosomes [80]. endogenous LC3 but not ectopically expressed GFP-LC3 co-localizes with coV RTCs. ER-associated degradation (ERAD) tuning pathway, a vesicular transport route out of the ER, has been shown to be important for CoV infection. authors hypothesize that one or more nsp proteins might associate with components of the machinery of EDEMosomes. MHV hijacking of LC3-positive EDEMosomes for its replication appears to be clearly established. however, this finding has not yet been extended to other beta-CoV or other CoV in general. authors of this study observed GFP-LC3 puncta formation in cells ectopically expressing the nsp3 fragment but did not examine whether these puncta are indeed autophagosomes. the relevance of the use of a truncated form of nsp3 in absence of a CoV infection remains to be determined. nsp6 from MHV and SARS-CoV also induced GFP-LC3 puncta formation indicating that the nsp6-dependent mechanism for autophagy induction might be conserved among CoVs. cottam et al. also argued that nsp6 might reduce the expansion of the autophagosomes as well, while maturation into autolysosomes is still possible. results obtained by studying viruses from other orders have revealed that autophagy and ATG proteins can practically play a key role in every step of a virus life cycle. it remains unclear whether this is due to a subversion of autophagy by the virus or whether it is a physiological response to the cellular stress caused by either the infection or the transfection of single viral proteins."}
