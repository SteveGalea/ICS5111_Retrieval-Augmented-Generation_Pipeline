{"summary": "the length of the incubation period varies according to the infectious agent, the host immunological fitness, and previous immunological experience. in humans, it is difficult to determine the length of the incubation period since the exact time of infection is usually unknown. the abrupt onset of symptoms following infection with respiratory viruses marks the termination of the incubation period. patients treated with type I IFN, TNF-, IL-1, IL-1 or IL-6 report flu-like symptoms without actually presenting with a respiratory virus infection [10,11,13]. cytokines are usually observed prior to tissue damage generated by cytotoxic T cells or direct tissue damage caused by the virus infection. symptoms also result from cross talk of the immune system with the nervous system. virus-infected lung and in the serum demonstrate similar kinetics to the above-mentioned cytokines. the cellular sources of these cytokines are still not completely known. both epithelial and hematopoietic cells are involved. the role of a third member of the RLR family, the RNA helicase Lgp2, is less understood. the main inflammasome complex involved in the response to the RNA viruses discussed in this review is NLRP3. NLRP3 is required to generate the active form of the cytokines IL-1, IL-18 and IL-33. influenza virus M2 causes changes in ionic concentration in cellular compartments. some evidence suggests that TLR-4, TLR-6 and TLR-2 play a role in recognition of RSV [31,32] while MeV hemagglutinin is recognized by TLR-2 [33] inflammasome complex is required to produce active form of cytokines IL-1, IL-18 and IL-33. signal one is given by recognition of viral RNA. NLRP3 is activated after exposure to ATP, dsRNA, poly I:C and crystals such as monosodium urate. type I IFNs belong to a family of cytokines consisting of one subtype of IFN-, 13 subtypes of IFN- and also IFN-, IFN-, IFN- and IFN-. the secretion of type I IFNs is delayed in vivo until a few days after infection. transmembrane protein subunits IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 are present on the surface of every nucleated cell. the dimerization of the two subunits leads to activation of the intracellular kinases Jak1 and Tyk2. phosphorylate the STAT transcription factors leading to the generation of STAT homodimers (STAT1) and heterodimers (STAT1 with STAT2) the activation of all these factors in response to virus infection is induced by triggering either the RLR or TLR systems. secreted type I IFNs signal through the IFN-/ receptor complex (IFNAR), composed of two transmembrane protein subunits, IFNAR1 and IFNAR2. FN- (IFN-R) is composed by one IFN-R chain and one IL-10R chain. expression of IFN-R appears to be restricted to non-hematopoietic cells. RSV NS1 and NS2 can block type I IFN induction by binding RIG-I. it is surprising that very little evidence exists for inhibition of the TLR signaling pathway by the viruses discussed above. it has been suggested that certain strains and MeV can inhibit type I IFN induction by TLR-7 and TLR-9 signaling. inhibition of interferon induction Viruses have evolved to inhibit IFN induction in a number of ways. by blocking IFN induction and signaling the virus also limits the enhancement of the response to infection. the many functions of the influenza A non-structural protein 1 (NS1) have been recently reviewed. the V protein acts as a decoy substrate for the kinase IB kinase, competing with IRF7 [79\u201381]. no evidence exists for such inhibition by Influenza, HRV or human parainfluenza virus (hPIV) studies of influenza NS1 antagonism in vivo provide a model for respiratory virus inhibition of innate immunity. a close examination of an in vivo influenza virus infection showed that the virus replicates in the lung for almost two days without inducing an innate immune response. a number of possible mechanisms by which the immune system can be stimulated to initiate inflammation. the immune system may stimulate neighboring cells to produce cytokines and chemoattract other immune cells from the blood. the TLR system avoids viral antagonism by rapidly sensing the virus inside endosomal compartments. type I IFN signal transduction turns on transcriptional programs within cells that can decrease the inhibitory effects of the viral antagonists upon infection. it is known that pre-exposure of DCs to type I IFNs upregulates costimulatory molecules, improving their function as antigen presenting cells. a close examination of an in vivo influenza virus infection in mice showed that the virus replicates in the lung for almost two days without inducing an innate immune response. two days after infection with an NS1 competent virus, a robust and abrupt immune response is initiated in the infected lungs. this event demarcates the initiation of innate immunity. a number of possible mechanisms by which the immune system can be stimulated to initiate inflammation in an inflamed tissue. the sensing of \u201cdanger signals\u201d [97] in the form of factors released from infected necrotic or apoptotic cells may stimulate neighboring cells to produce cytokines. the TLR system avoids viral antagonism by rapidly sensing the virus inside endosomal compartments in uninfected phagocytes. type I IFN signal transduction turns on transcriptional programs within cells that can decrease the inhibitory effects of the viral antagonists upon infection. it is known that pre-exposition of DCs to type I IFNs upregulates costimulatory molecules and major histocompatibility class I and II molecules. inflammatory response can also affect non-hematopoietic cells such as uninfected epithelial cells. sensing of \"danger signals\" [97] in form of factors released from infected cells may stimulate neighboring cells to produce cytokines and chemoattract other immune cells from the blood. the viral polymerase of many viruses discussed here is error-prone. it is also possible that such a process promotes mistakes in viral replication. it has been shown that stocks of SeV with high DI content enhance the immune response. FNs are also induced after respiratory virus infection and likely limit virus spread in epithelial cells. the speed at which this process occurs is controlled by the ability of the virus to suppress inflammation. this observation points out that the multifaceted inflammatory response can also affect non-hematopoietic cells. the incubation period is a helpful definition that describes the time between virus infection and the onset of symptoms. the delayed symptoms (innate immune response) are likely common to almost all known respiratory virus infections."}
