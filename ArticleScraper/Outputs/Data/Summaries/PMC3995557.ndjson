{"summary": "influenza A virus has a wide range of hosts. it has infected human, but also been reported interspecies transmission from humans to other animals, such as pigs, poultry, dogs and cats. prevalence of influenza A virus infections in cats in northeastern china is unknown. a total of 1140 feline blood samples were collected from 56 different pet hospitals and four small animal shelters around northeastern China. 660 blood samples from pet cats in hospitals and 480 blood samples from roaming cats were obtained. serological screening revealed 21% pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infection in cats in northeastern china based on NT. prevalence of the infection also showed a geographical difference in roaming cats based on NT. 115 serum samples collected in 2008 had no HI or NT antibodies against A/California/7/2009. only twenty-four samples had a HI titer of 1:40 against H1N1. a total of 111 (9.7%) sera were positive by HI assay against H3N2 CIV. dalian 120 0 (0/120) 0 (0/120) 67.58[4.06-1124] 165 23.6%(39/165) 21.2%(35/165) 1.96[1.20-3.20] Total 480 11%(53/480) 10.7%(51/480) 660 30.6%(202/660) 28.0%(189/660) OR(95% CI)b Reference Reference 0.28[0.20-0.39] 0.30[0.21-0.41] aThe the prevalence of this virus infection in cats in mainland China remains unknown. this is the first survey on the seroprevalence of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infection in cats in northeastern china. the prevalence of seropositive pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in male cats versus female cats suggests that the male cats may be more susceptible (P 0.05) to the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infections. study has observed a relatively high seroprevalence of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in cats in northeastern china. similar seroprevalence studies should be conducted elsewhere. authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
