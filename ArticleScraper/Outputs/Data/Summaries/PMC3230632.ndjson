{"summary": "the 2009 pandemic has raised several major concerns related to the few prophylactic and therapeutic measures available. antiviral compounds have drawbacks caused by the rapid emergence of drug-resistant isolates [5], [6], require prompt administration to be effective [7], and have several associated side-effects especially in high-risk categories. vaccinal strategy is exposed to the annual risk of being ineffective due to possible mismatches between predicted strains included in the vaccine and those actually in circulation. HA is the major glycoprotein of the influenza virus. it binds sialic acid on the surface of the cells through its globular head. it makes possible the fusion of the viral envelope with the endosomal membranes through its stalk region. the sixteen known subtypes of HA have been clustered in two distinct phylogenetic groups. gG PN-SIA28 was generated and tested in different neutralization assays against human, swine and avian influenza A viruses belonging to both HA based phylogenetic groups. results showed that IgG PN-SIA28 strongly neutralizes viruses belonging to the group 1 as well as those of the group 2. PN-SIA28 is able to neutralize all of the group 1 strains spanning 1968 and 1975. a green \u2018+\u2019 indicates positive neutralizing activity, a red \u2018\u2019 indicates negative neutralizing activity. recombinant HA from H5N1 A/Cygnus Olor/Italy/742/2005 was recognized by PN-SIA28. # H1N1 A/New Caledonia/20/1999 was previously shown to be neutralized by PN-SIA28 as Fab fragment. a random 12-mer peptide phage displayed library was screened. twenty-five positive clones were sequenced. circles on the top indicate PN-SIA28 percent binding to each HA alanine mutant compared to binding to wild-type HA. recombinant HA from H1N1 A/South Carolina/1/1918 pandemic strain was previously shown to be bound by PN-SIA28 [19], [20]. a large panel of HA-alanine mutants was generated. the alanine scanning study showed that PN-SIA28 was not longer able to bind to the mutated HAs. all other mutations listed in the table S1 did not have any effect on binding. four alanine mutants were initially generated on the A/Aichi/2/68 (H3N2) HA. none of these alanine mutated HAs was bound by PN-SIA28. white areas indicate the HA1 domains of H1 trimer. cyan areas indicate its HA2 domains. red regions indicate residues 25 and 45 on HA1. Fab PN-SIA28 recognizes an epitope on the stem region of HA. it is well documented in the literature that bivalency of a whole IgG molecule may be an essential features for the biological activity of a mAb [21], [22], [23], [24] for this reason, in this work, to evaluate PN-SIA28 features as whole IgG molecule. PN-SIA28 neutralizing activity against all tested isolates. subtype Strain IC50 a g/ml (95% CIb) H1N1 A/Wilson Smith/33 0.4 (0.3\u20130.5) A/Puerto Rico/8/34 0.8 (0.2\u20132.9) A/Malaya/302/54 0.7 (0.3\u20131.4) A/Milan/UHSR1/2009 1.5 (1.3\u20131.6) A/swine/Parma/1/97 PN-SIA28 is able to neutralize all of the group 1 strains spanning 1968 and 1975. recombinant HA from (H1N1) A/Cygnus Olor/Italy/742/2005 was previously shown to be bound by PN-SIA28. this study allowed the identification of several possible residues located on the stem region of HA potentially involved in the binding of PN-SIA28. asn336, Ile337, Pro338, Trp357 and Thr358 (sequence numbering refers to A/PR/8/34, GenBank accession number ABO21709) mutated residues decrease PN-SIA28 binding to mutated HAs. a large panel of HA-alanine mutants was generated. the mutants carried each a single amino acidic mutation in position 361 (Ile361Thr) and in position 362 (Asp362Gly) in the HA2 subunit compared to wild type. the residues identified lie on the stem region of HA, that they belong to the HA1 and HA2 subunits. white areas indicate the HA1 domains of the HA trimer, whereas cyan areas indicate the HA2 domains. alanine-mutants (Asp18, Lys57 and Ile70) were generated considering the differences in the stem region between H3N2 A/Victoria/3/1975 and H3N2 A/Philippines/2/1982. a 30% binding decrease was observed for Lys57Ala HA mutant, while the Asp18Ala and Ile70Ala did not have any effect on PN-SIA28 binding to H3N2 HA. PN-SIA28 binding compared to wild-type HA. grey areas indicate HA1 domains whereas white areas indicate HA2 domains. a random 12-mer peptide library was screened. circles on the top indicate PN-SIA28 percent binding to each alanine mutant compared to binding to wild-type HA. recombinant HA from H1N1 A/South Carolina/1/1918 pandemic strain was previously shown to be bound by PN-SIA28 [19], [20]. a large panel of HA-alanine mutants were generated in position 362 (Asp362Ala) the binding of PN-SIA28 to HA was decreased by his25Ala, His45Ala mutants on HA1 and Thr358Ala, Met360Ala, Ile361Ala, Asp362Ala, Gly363Ala, Trp364Ala, Thr384Ala and Val395Ala mutants on trimer decreasing binding of PN-SIA28 to HA. white areas indicate the HA1 domains of the HA trimer. cyan areas indicate the HA2 domains. red regions indicate residues 25 and 45 on HA1 and 361 and 362 on HA2 that, when mutated, were able to inhibit PN-SIA28 binding both to H1 and H3 HAs. yellow circle on Lys57Ala mutant indicate 50\u201375% PN-SIA28 binding compared to wild-type HA. IgG PN-SIA28 was tested against a large panel of influenza A viruses belonging to group 1 (H1N1, H2N2, H5N1, H9N2) and group 2 (H3N2, H7N2) subtypes showing a broader neutralizing activity compared to its monovalent molecule. PN-SIA28 showed a robust neutralizing activity (IC50 = 0.4\u20133.7 g/ml) against all tested strains belonging to group 1. a phagemidic random peptide library suggested the binding of PN-SIA28 to the stem region in the proximity of the viral membrane. none of these two specific mutations is present in any of the more than 6,000 sequences available in public influenza databases. the region is functionally highly conserved in all subtypes. Ile361Ala, Asp362Ala, Gly363Ala, Trp364Ala, Thr384Ala and Val395Ala on HA2 influenced the interaction of PN-SIA28 with HA (H1). the more restricted panel of alanine mutants (His25Ala, Asn45Ala, Ile361Ala and Asp362Ala) were generated considering the differences between solvent exposed residues close to the future definition of HA/PN-SIA28 crystal structure may help confirm the possible role of conserved VH3-30 residues in conferring such unusual neutralization properties. the future definition of HA/PN-SIA28 crystal structure and its comparison with HA/FI6v3 complex may help confirm the possible role of conserved VH3-30 residues in conferring such unusual neutralization properties. PN-SIA28 neutralizes influenza viruses belonging to all subtypes that have caused pandemics in humans, as well as other subtypes with pandemic potential. pharmacokinetic studies have shown that the extremely low IC50 featured by PN-SIA28 against most of the isolates tested can easily be reached in humans after systemic administration. PN-SIA28 is mainly directed against the highly conserved HA2 domain. it is important to identify also residues belonging to HA1 domain to be preserved. the isolation of PN-SIA28 has been previously described [19], [20]. the baculovirus expression vector pAc--Fc was used to infect 1109 H5 insect cells in a final volume of 1 liter. the antibody was eluted with citric acid 0.1 M, pH 3, and immediately neutralized with Tris Base 1 M, pH 9. swine origin influenza virus (S-OIV) (H1N1) A/swine/Parma/1/1997) was previously isolated in our laboratory. swine origin influenza virus (S-OIV) (H1N1) A/swine/Parma/1/1997) was previously isolated in our laboratory. all viruses, excluding the A/swine/Parma/1/1997, were cultured on MDCK (Madin-Darby Canine Kidney) cells propagated in Modified Eagle Medium (MEM), supplemented with 10% inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gibco Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) at 80% confluence, cells in MEM supplemented with 2 g/ml serum-free TPCK-trypsin the supernatant was then aliquoted and stored at 80\u00b0C as cell-free virus stock. each viral isolate was titrated by the limiting dilution method. the neutralization activity for each antibody concentration was expressed as the percentage reduction of fluorescent nuclei compared with the nuclei count in the infection control. the neutralization curves were then fit by non-linear regression with the GraphPad Prism software, allowing IC50 calculation. the viral titre was also calculated as plaque forming units (PFU) on six-well plates. two dilutions, 1\u20130.1 g/ml, of IgG PN-SIA28 were preincubated for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C. after this incubation, the medium was removed and the monolayer washed twice with PBS. 300 ng of PN-SIA 28 were coated on four wells (96-wells plate, COSTAR) the peptide library was amplified transforming electrocompetent E. coli XL1 Blue. positive clones were sequenced using the kit-provided primers. 100 TCID50 of A/PR/8/34 were prepared in 1.5 mL of the same medium. the two solutions, containing antibodies and virus, were mixed in order to obtain a final concentration of 1 g/ml, 5 g/ml and 10 g/ml for the mAbs in a final volume of 3 mL. the mixes were then incubated 1 h at 37\u00b0C. the cells of the infection positive control and mock control were compared with infected cells under selective pressure of PN-SIA28. after ten passages, the cells of the infection positive control and mock control were compared with infected cells under selective pressure of PN-SIA28. the presence or absence of CPE in the PN-SIA28 treated cells was evaluated.
