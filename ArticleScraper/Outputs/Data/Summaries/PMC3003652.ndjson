{"summary": "the lungs are continuously exposed to dust, pollen, chemicals, and microbial pathogens. soluble host defence mediators such as secretory IgA, antimicrobial peptides, surfactant proteins, lactoferrin, and lysozyme also bolster the mucosal defences of the lower respiratory tract. the purpose of this article is to review the role of TLRs in the pathogenesis or consequences of acute lung injury and chronic inflammatory lung diseases. recognition of pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or endogenous damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) by host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) elicits innate immune responses that subsequently instruct adaptive immunity. prototypic examples of PAMPs include lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a outer membrane component of Gram-negative bacteria that stimulates TLR4 [8,9], bacterial lipoproteins that stimulate TLR2 in conjunction with either TLR1 or TLR6 [10] and flagellin, the protein monomer of bacterial flagella that activates TLR5 [11]. nucleic acids are recognized by endosomal TLRs; double-stranded DNA with un mouse TLR10 is a pseudogene and human TLR11 encodes a truncated protein. prototypic examples of PAMPs include lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a membrane component of Gram-negative bacteria that stimulates TLR4 [8,9], bacterial lipoproteins that stimulate TLR2 in conjunction with either TLR1 or TLR6 [10] and flagellin, the protein monomer of bacterial flagella that activates the high mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1) protein that normally resides in the cell nucleus can activate TLR2 and induce hallmarks of lupus-like disease. overlapping intracellular signaling pathways downstream of each TLR activate specific transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes responsible for inflammatory and immune responses. soluble forms of TLR4 and TLR2 may function as decoy receptors to terminate ligand interactions with membrane bound TLRs. soluble forms of TLR4 and TLR2 may function as decoy receptors to terminate ligand interactions with membrane bound TLRs. primary bronchial epithelial cells express mRNA for TLR1-10 and secrete the chemokine CXCL8 (IL-8) in response to various TLR ligands. human AMs express low levels of TLR3, TLR5, and TLR9 and higher levels of TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR7, and TLR8 [35,36] ALI/ARDS is a life-threatening condition that is characterized by increased inflammatory cytokine expression and cell infiltration into the lungs, non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, and diffuse alveolar damage. ALI can be a consequence of bacterial or viral infection or may be triggered by non-infectious insults including environmental toxin exposure (ozone, heavy metals) cross talk between HS-induced ALI elicits heightened inflammatory mediator expression, such as CXCL1. early inflammation in HS-induced ALI is dependent on upregulation of TLR4 by LPS. later inflammation is mediated by heightened TLR2 expression on AMs and endothelial cells. infectious causes of ALI/ARDS Pneumonia is the most common cause of ALI/ARDS. the 2003 global SARS epidemic had a 50% mortality rate with 16% of all infected individuals developing ALI. mice that survived beyond the acute phase of infection had large regions of lung interstitial and intra-alveolar fibrosis and ALI. the role of TLRs has been intensively studied in influenza infection. despite the importance of TLR7/MyD88 signaling, mice can still produce type I IFN, control viral replication, and recover from the infection. non-infectious causes of ALI/ARDS Hemorrhagic shock (HS) can prime the host immune response to elicit excessive inflammation, neutrophil influx and tissue injury in response to a secondary stimulus. cross talk between TLR2 and TLR4 elicits heightened inflammatory mediator expression, such as CXCL1 leading to increased neutrophil influx and pulmonary edema. TLR4 or TLR2/TLR4 double knockout mice exposed to hyperoxia have significantly greater lung inflammation and permeability. TLR3-deficient mice are protected from ALI due to decreased neutrophil recruitment, induction of pro-apoptotic factors, and increased surfactant protein expression that clears injury-induced cellular debris. the 2003 global SARS epidemic had a 50% mortality rate with 16% of all infected individuals developing ALI. the lung pathology in these patients mirrored ALI caused by other factors. a protective role for TLR4 [87] and MyD88 [88] has been suggested. the role of TLR3 in the immune response to influenza has been debated in the literature. dsRNA is not produced during influenza replication [97,98], very low and potentially undetectable levels of this viral intermediate could still elicit a substantial immune response through TLR3 [99,100]. a predisposition to chronic and progressive P. aeruginosa infection occurs despite the finding that both CF and non-CF lung epithelial cells express functional TLRs that can mediate inflammatory responses to microbes. a more recent study showed increased inflammatory responses following stimulation with clinical Pseudomonas isolates in a CF airway epithelial cell line. TLR5-deficient mice showed impaired bacterial clearance, reduced airway neutrophil recruitment and MCP-1 production. deletion of the adaptor molecule MyD88 does confer hypersusceptibility, increased lung bacterial load, and deficient neutrophil recruitment. despite higher bacterial load, myD88-deficient mice had less inflammation and decreased mortality compared to wild type mice infected with B. cenocepacia. microbial pathogens often establish residence in the lower respiratory tract and induce a vicious circle of inflammation and infection that may contribute to progressive loss of lung function. mice with short-term cigarette smoke exposure develop neutrophilic airway inflammation that is dependent on TLR4, MyD88, and IL-1R1 signaling. long-term cigarette smoke exposure induced strain-dependent emphysema in one study. patients with mild or moderate COPD showed increased expression of TLR4 and HBD-2, a TLR4 inducible antimicrobial peptide. those with advanced COPD had a reduction in TLR4 and HBD-2 expression. differences in TLR expression could be related to variable LPS content in tobacco smoke, bacterial colonization, or a persistent inflammatory state. cigarette smoke, dsRNA or influenza virus leads to emphysema in mice. this process was mediated by IL-12, IL-18, and IFN- as well as activation of antiviral response pathways. defective innate immunity may predispose to acute exacerbations of COPD. TLR9-deficient mice are slightly more susceptible to pneumococcal infection compared to wild type animals. abrogation of myD88 signaling leads to uncontrolled airway pneumococcal growth, systemic bacterial dissemination and decreased immune mediator (TNF- and IL-6) expression. experimental treatment of pregnant mice with acinetobacter lwoffii F78 was shown to confer protection against asthma in the progeny. the protective effect was shown to be dependent on maternal TLR expression and suggests that microbial recognition during pregnancy somehow primes the fetal lung environment for a Th1 response later in life. ligands of TLR7 and TLR8 play a role in the development of allergic asthma. ligands of TLR7 and TLR8 are associated with human asthma. ligands of TLR7 and TLR8 can prevent airway remodeling caused by experimentally induced asthma. antibiotic treatment of asthmatic patients infected with M. pneumoniae improves pulmonary function. bacterial colonization and interactions with host innate immune response play in asthma exacerbations and mortality. TLR3-deficient mice have a predominantly Th2 response to RSV. this is characterized by increased airway eosinophilia, mucus hypersecretion and expression of IL-5 and IL-13. this suggests that the disease can be mediated or exacerbated in genetically predisposed individuals by infection. a predisposition to chronic and progressive P. aeruginosa infection occurs despite the finding that both CF and non-CF lung epithelial cells express functional TLRs that can mediate inflammatory responses to microbes. CF and non-CF lung epithelial cells express functional TLRs that can mediate inflammatory responses to microbes. ellin dependent IL-8 secretion, phagocytosis, and respiratory burst activity were attributed to chronic infection. TLR5-deficient mice showed impaired bacterial clearance, reduced airway neutrophil recruitment and MCP-1 production. deletion of the adaptor molecule MyD88 does confer hypersusceptibility, increased lung bacterial load, and deficient neutrophil recruitment. despite higher bacterial load, myD88-deficient mice had less inflammation and decreased mortality compared to wild type mice infected with B. cenocepacia. microbial pathogens often establish residence in the lower respiratory tract and induce a vicious circle of inflammation and infection that may contribute to progressive loss of lung function. mice with short-term cigarette smoke exposure develop neutrophilic airway inflammation that is dependent on TLR4, MyD88, and IL-1R1 signaling. long-term cigarette smoke exposure induced strain-dependent emphysema in one study, although no specific association to TLRs was described. patients with mild or moderate COPD showed increased expression of TLR4 and HBD-2, a TLR4 inducible antimicrobial peptide. those with advanced COPD had a reduction in TLR4 and HBD-2 expression. differences in TLR expression could be related to variable LPS content in tobacco smoke, bacterial colonization, or a persistent inflammatory state. nasopharyngeal infection of TLR4-deficient mice with S. pneumoniae causes enhanced bacterial load, dissemination, and death compared to wild type mice. nasopharyngeal infection of TLR4-deficient mice with S. pneumoniae causes enhanced host defense. myD88 signaling leads to uncontrolled airway pneumococcal growth, systemic bacterial dissemination and decreased immune mediator (TNF- and IL-6) expression. the severe susceptibility phenotype of myD88-deficient mice compared to mice with a single deletion of TLR9 or combined deletion of TLR4 and TLR4 ligands. a cytokine milieu can bias lung DCs towards a Th2 activating phenotype that drives the polarization of nave lymphocytes. eosinophil derived neurotoxin can induce TLR2-dependent DC maturation, leading to Th2 polarization by secretion of high amounts of IL-6 and IL-10 [184] ligands of TLR7 and TLR8 are associated with human asthma. ligands of TLR7 and TLR8 can prevent airway remodeling caused by experimentally induced asthma. ligands of TLR7 and TLR8 have also been associated with asthma. antibiotic treatment of asthmatic patients infected with M. pneumoniae improves pulmonary function. bacterial colonization and interactions with host innate immune response play in asthma exacerbations and mortality. in human lung fibroblasts and epithelial cells, the formation of dsRNA during RSV replication can activate TLR3-mediated immune signaling, leading to the upregulation of the chemokines RANTES and IP-10 [218]. Interestingly, while TLR3 is involved in chemokine expression it has no role in RSV viral clearance, which is primarily mediated by the TLR2/TLR6 heterodimer. despite extensive research, many questions remain unanswered. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors declare that they have no competing interests. health centre and a grant from the german research foundation (MS)."}
