{"summary": "the small glutamine-rich, tetratricopeptide repeat-containing protein alpha (SGTA) is a co-chaperone involved in a specific branch of the global cellular quality control network that determines the fate of secretory and membrane proteins that mislocalize to the cytosol. SGTA recognizes surface exposed regions of hydrophobicity on newly synthesized tail-anchored (TA) proteins and mislocalized proteins (MLPs) SGTA is a 34 kDa protein made up of 313 amino acids. it assembles as a homodimer, with each chain comprising three structural domains. SGTA is highly conserved in different eukaryotes. the central TPR repeats are the most conserved. full length SGTA is made up of 313 residues. an N-terminal homodimerization domain (residues 1\u201369) followed by a 14-residue linker. three TPR repeats with a distinct capping helix (residues 86\u2013208) and a C-terminal domain (residues 211\u2013313) have been aligned. small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) studies concur with an elongated arrangement of the yeast Sgt2 dimer devoid of its C-terminal domain, with full length Sgt2 showing characteristics of a partially folded protein. a lack of conservation of the linker between the N-terminal domain and the TPR suggests a flexible connection between these two domains. SGTA is yet to be structurally characterized, hence the nature and extent of its hydrophobic substrate-binding site. the nature and extent of its hydrophobic substrate-binding site, along with mechanistic details pertaining to its interactions with TA proteins and MLPs, remain poorly understood. two orthogonal views representing solution NMR structure of the N-terminal domain of mammalian SGTA (PDB accession code 4CPG) are shown in blue indicating the four alpha helices present in each protomer (1\u20134) hydrophobic residues present in inner region of the mammalian N-terminal dimer, forming a tight core, are shown as sticks. apolar residues in both proteins are buried in the interface creating further stabilization of the complex through hydrophobic interactions. the association with UBLs breaks the symmetry of the N-terminal dimer, and the stoichiometry of the resulting complex. structure of the TPR domain of human SGTA was solved in 2008 by X-ray crystallography. it consists of three TPR motifs arranged in tandem, each formed by a pair of -helices folded in an antiparallel fashion. this is followed by a C-terminal capping helix (helix 7) that packs against the second helix. helix-turn-helix repeats formed by helices 1/2,3/4, and 5/6 can be observed in the structure, followed by a capping helix (7), to form a right handed superhelical assembly. the TPR structure presents a longer capping helix oriented at a 10\u00b0 angular increment when compared to the equivalent region of human SGTA-TPR. the fold of the human SGTA TPR domain was found to be highly similar to two binding interactions of SGTA through its TPR motif appear to provide a physical link with ATP-dependent molecular chaperones. the TPR domain also interacts with several proteins such as hormone receptors, viral proteins and myostatin. full length SGTA and fragments containing the C-terminal domain were found to interact with polypeptide fragments containing six or more consecutive non-polar residues. SGTA with its C-terminus removed did not interact with the hydrophobic fragments showing that the C-terminus was necessary for interaction with hydrophobic substrates. cysteine string protein was identified by Y2H screening as a binding partner for the C-terminal domain. SGTA in protein homeostasis and quality control SGTA interacts with a range of chaperone networks and pathways through its central TPR domain. the ability of SGTA to recognize and shield surface exposed regions of hydrophobicity, termed \u201cdegrons\u201d on MLPs prevents substrate aggregation and promotes normal cellular proteostasis. SGTA's role extends to the shielding of exposed hydrophobic regions on TA proteins facilitating their post-translational integration into the ER. this enables the handover of TA proteins to the downstream TRC40 targeting complex. SGTA has been implicated in hormone receptor signaling. SGTA is capable of reversing ubiquitination initiated by the BAG6 complex. thus rescuing proteins from degradation via an as yet unidentified deubiquitinating enzyme. SGTA is intricately associated with the quality control function of BAG6 in deciding the fate of hydrophobic substrates. SGTA associates with the 19S regulatory particle of the 26S proteasome. it is known that the BAG6 subunit of the heterotrimeric BAG6 complex interacts with the intrinsic proteasomal ubiquitin receptor RPN10. this model suggests that an SGTA/BAG6 cycle operating at the proteasome may regulate access of MLPs to the proteolytic core, allowing substrates several rescue attempts before being committed to proteasomal degradation. TA proteins constitute around 5% of all human membrane proteins, including SNAREs, ER translocon components and signaling proteins. in mammals, these proteins are delivered to the ER membrane by a conserved transmembrane domain recognition complex (TRC) pathway. this facilitates TA protein transfer to the dedicated TRC40 (transmembrane domain recognition complex 40) targeting complex before being passed onto membrane receptors for insertion. SGTA in the regulation of hormone receptor signaling SGTA interacts with steroid receptor complexes and signaling pathways including those of the androgen receptor (AR), a nuclear transcription factor (Paul et al., 2014). SGTA in the regulation of hormone receptor signaling SGTA interacts with the AR hinge region through its TPR domain. the role of SGTA in viral infections was first described in the context of SGTA as a binding partner for NS1. this was based on data suggesting SGTA localization in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of rat fibroblasts, potentially implicating SGTA in parvoviral replication and/or gene expression. the function of SGTA in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) particle release has been studied in some detail. SGTA is emerging as a key effector in the cellular quality control of MLPs. it is also known that Vpu can affect cellular localization of SGTA and Gag proteins. it is also known that SGTA promotes viral infections where it can facilitate virus transport from ER to cytosol by assisting in membrane penetration. ubiquitination relies on deubiquitinating enzymes that collaborate with components of the SGTA/BAG6 cycle. further investigation is necessary to identify these DUBs. elucidation of the precise mechanism whereby SGTA substrates interact with Hsp70/Hsp90 chaperones will improve our understanding of proteostasis networks in which these components operate. the financial support of the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) of the UK.
