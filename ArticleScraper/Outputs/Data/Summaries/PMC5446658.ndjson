{"summary": "in the early stages, SARS-CoV infection in the human lung causes acute lung injury (ALI) leading to diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), hyaline membrane formation, and interstitial thickening. Survivors have no detectable SARS-CoV virus in nasopharyngeal fluid by 20 days postinfection (2). the wound healing response can become dysregulated, resulting in scarring and fibrosis (8\u201310) there are limited treatment options for pulmonary fibrosis. corticosteroids are used for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pulmonary fibrosis (PF) during a viral infection, these interventions dampen the immune response. mice containing a constitutively active EGFR were infected with SARS-CoV. the key driver of this pathway in wild-type mice is the ligands that are released from damaged cells to bind and activate EGFR. the key driver of this pathway is the ligands that are released from damaged cells to bind and activate EGFR. microarray and transcriptome analyses were performed on total RNA isolated from mouse lungs at days 2, 5 and 9 postinfection. a subset of wound healing pathway genes were induced in the lungs of mice after infection with SARS-CoV(MA15) western blot analysis of protein lysate prepared from NIH 3T3(7d) cells constitutively overexpressing EGFR (NIH 3T3-HER1) that have been transfected with either scrambled siRNA (siScr) or STAT1-targeted siRNAs (siSTAT1) and probed using anti-EGFR and anti-tubulin antibodies. gene expression values were used to create heat maps in Fig. 1A. the gene expression values were used to create the heat maps in Fig. 1A. the EGFR pathway is upregulated in STAT1/ mice. previous studies on repair of damaged tissue have identified EGFR signaling as a key modulator of this response (15\u201320) there is known interplay between EGFR and STAT1. STAT1 in turn suppresses the proliferative effects of EGFR signaling. the details of how STAT1 regulates EGFR are not well understood. mRNA levels of Egfr remain relatively unchanged in wild-type and EGFR(DSK5) mice. once EGFR is activated, it is internalized and undergoes lysosomal degradation (25\u201329) this recycling is continuous in EGFR(DSK5) mice, reducing total EGFR(DSK5) cellular protein. EGFR(DSK5) mice express similar levels of RNA but show lower levels of protein in lung fibroblasts and the liver. protein lysates from the livers of 12-week-old wild-type and EGFR(DSK5) mice were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-EGFR and anti-tubulin antibodies. wild-type 129S1 and EGFR(DSK5) mice infected with SARS-CoV(MA15) lost 12% of their body weight through 4 days postinfection and then recovered to their starting weight by 9 days postinfection. other than weight loss, there were no obvious clinical presentations of disease in either mouse strain. chromogenic reaction was performed using a DAB/HRP kit. Western blot analysis of lung lysates from wild-type and EGFR(DSK5) mice probed with anti-PCNA and anti-tubulin antibodies. values for PCNA levels were normalized to -tubulin. EGFR(DSK5) mouse lungs display cellular overproliferation after SARS-CoV(MA15) infection. a failure to initiate the contraction of fibroblasts can result in fibrosis. overproliferation of fibroblasts near the airways is often seen during pulmonary fibrosis. wild-type lungs showed only disparate cells positive for PCNA. lungs from EGFR(DSK5)-infected mice showed high levels of PCNA-positive nuclei in cells surrounding the airways. this showed that these lungs had sustained cellular proliferation implying unresolved wound healing activity. we infected 20- to 24-week-old wild-type mice with 1 105, 1 104, and 1 103 PFU/mouse of SARS-CoV(MA15) by intranasal inoculation and followed pathogenesis for 9 days. the doses of 1 103 PFU/mouse were 30% lethal in older wild-type mice (n = 10) and 80% lethal in older EGFR(DSK5) mice (n = 10) by older EGFR(DSK5) mice are more susceptible to a SARS-CoV(MA15) infection than younger mice. ten- to 12-week-old (young) and 20- to 24-week-old (old) mice were intranasally inoculated with either PBS or SARS-CoV(MA15) at 104 or 105 PFU/mouse. survival was monitored for 9 days postinfection. EGFR(DSK5) mice infected with SARS-CoV have increased lung pathology at day 9 postinfection. genes associated with wound healing and fibrosis are shown in a heat map comparing wild-type and EGFR(DSK5) mice after infection. expression of fibrosis genes also showed a similar trend at day 2 postinfection. EGFR(DSK5) mice show upregulation of the fibrosis genes Ccl2, Col3a1 and Timp1. expression values were normalized to values from PBS-infected mice. heat maps of fold induction of wound healing-associated genes (A) and fibrosis-associated genes (B) were generated. 096776 1.059201306 0.986298634 Ccr7 0.700600751 0.959284087 0.755442443 0.557370151 Irf1 3.217282227 1.287565169 4.585635657 1.798946617 Muc5b 2.315258479 1.205862028 2.581860544 2.648811986 Muc5ac 0.979148208 1.47593371 1.06899625 1.2 the gene expression values were used to create the heat maps in Fig. 5A. the heat maps were used to create the heat maps in Fig. 5A. the expression of Ccl2, Col3a1 and Timp1 was analyzed by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of lung samples at days 2, 5 and 9 postinfection of wild-type and EGFR(DSK5) mice. qRT-PCR analysis showed that Ccl2 was upregulated 4.8-fold in wild-type mice and 35.7-fold in EGFR(DSK5) mice. the expression levels of Ccl2 and Timp1 in the lungs of older EGFR(DSK5) mice infected at 1 103 PFU/mouse were elevated compared to those in wild-type mice. a subset of fibrosis genes were overactivated in the EGFR(DSK5) mice after SARS-CoV infection. we performed quantitative RT-PCR to measure transcript levels in wild-type and EGFR(DSK5) mice. we found no gene induction of egf, btc, tgfa, ereg, and epgn in wild-type or EGFR(DSK5) mice compared to PBS control-inoculated mice. however, two genes, hbegf and areg, were induced during infection, which corroborates the -type and EGFR(DSK5) mice were inoculated with either PBS or SARS-CoV(MA15) at 103 PFU/mouse. levels of HB-EGF and AREG mRNAs were normalized to those for wild-type mice. 20-week-old wild-type mice were intraperitoneally (i.p.) administered AREG and HB-EGF protein at the time of SARS-CoV(MA15) infection. ligand-treated mice showed enhanced perivascular cuffing, edema, and thickening of the alveolar septa. a subset of wound healing pathway genes were induced in the lungs of mice after infection with SARS-CoV(MA15). a number of genes associated with the wound healing response (e.g., CCL11, CCL3, CXCL1, IL-6, and IFNa) are upregulated in both WT and STAT1/ lungs at day 2 postinfection. however, most of these genes remain at elevated levels through day 9 postinfection. EGFR (NIH 3T3-HER1) transfected with either scrambled siRNA (siScr) or STAT1-targeted siRNAs (siSTAT1) and probed using anti-EGFR and anti-tubulin (as a loading control) antibodies. the gene expression values were used to create heat maps in Fig. 1A. the gene expression values were used to create the heat maps in Fig. 1A. the EGFR pathway is upregulated in STAT1/ mice. previous studies on repair of damaged tissue, regulation of wound healing, and development of fibrosis have identified EGFR signaling as a key modulator of this response. mRNA knocked down in NIH 3T3-HER1 cells using small interfering RNA (siRNA) the expression of EGFR was compared to that in cells treated with scrambled siRNA by Western blotting. this result is consistent with higher EGFR protein levels found in STAT1/ mouse liver. EGFR(DSK5) mice express similar levels of RNA but show lower levels of protein in lung fibroblasts and the liver. lysosomal degradation is continuous in EGFR(DSK5) mice, reducing total EGFR(DSK5) cellular protein. protein lysates from the livers of 12-week-old wild-type and EGFR(DSK5) mice were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-EGFR, anti-phopho-ERK1/2, and anti-total ERK1/2 antibodies. in vitro analysis with EGFR(DSK5) fibroblasts suggests that the constitutively active EGFR(DSK5) allele could lead to EGFR signaling dysregulation. wild-type and EGFR(DSK5) mouse lungs had similar virus titers at days 2 and 5 postinfection. both showed clearance by day 9 postinfection. weight loss is expressed as percentage of starting weight. sates from wild-type and EGFR(DSK5) mice probed with anti-PCNA and anti-tubulin antibodies. values for PCNA levels were normalized to -tubulin. all values are expressed relative to PCNA levels in PBS-treated wild-type mice. fibroblasts followed by the secretion of fresh extracellular matrix (ECM) components on which new tissue is built. failure to initiate contraction of fibroblasts can result in fibrosis. overproliferation of fibroblasts near the airways is often seen during pulmonary fibrosis. we compared the amounts of PCNA in total lung homogenates of wild-type or EGFR(DSK5) mice inoculated with either PBS or SARS-CoV during a time course of infection by Western blotting. at days 2 and 5 postinfection similar amounts of PCNA were observed in both wild-type and EGFR(DSK5) mice. the doses of 1 105, 1 104, and 1 103 PFU/mouse of SARS-CoV(MA15) were 30% lethal in older wild-type mice (n = 10) and 80% lethal in older EGFR(DSK5) mice (n = 10) by 5 days postinfection. both groups showed similar weight loss and recovery profiles over 9 days postinfection. 10- to 12-week-old (young) and 20- to 24-week-old (old) mice were intranasally inoculated with either PBS or SARS-CoV(MA15) at 104 or 105 PFU per mouse. survival was monitored for 9 days postinfection. genes associated with wound healing and fibrosis are shown in a heat map comparing wild-type and EGFR(DSK5) mice after infection. expression of fibrosis genes also showed a similar trend at day 2 postinfection, where wild-type and EGFR(DSK5) mice both expressed higher levels of most fibrosis genes. expression values were normalized to values from PBS-infected mice to obtain fold induction. heat maps of fold induction of wound healing-associated genes (A) and fibrosis-associated genes (B) were generated. gene expression values were used to create the heat maps in Fig. 5A. the gene expression values were used to create the heat maps in Fig. 5A. mice Day 2 Day 9 Icam1 1.5488509 1.149609225 1.855424964 1.596337223 Il1a 3.288089931 1.360019535 3.733819792 1.268028953 Lbp 2.114673337 1.354119802 2.465446331 1.651924068 Tnfrsf1b 2.141017245 1.571891356 2.567532492 1.604735456 Csf1 2.614 the expression of Ccl2, Col3a1 and Timp1 was analyzed by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of lung samples at days 2, 5 and 9 postinfection of wild-type and EGFR(DSK5) mice. qRT-PCR analysis showed that Ccl2 was upregulated 9.4-fold, versus 2.6-fold for the wild type, and Timp1 expression levels were upregulated 6.2-fold. expression levels of Ccl2 and Timp1 in the lungs of older EGFR(DSK5) mice infected at 1 103 PFU/mouse were elevated compared to those in wild-type mice. a subset of fibrosis genes were overactivated in the EGFR(DSK5) mice after SARS-CoV infection. eg, and epgn in wild-type or EGFR(DSK5) mice compared to PBS control-inoculated mice. but two genes, hbegf and areg, were induced during infection. the expression pattern for areg and hbegf in wild-type mice follows that of virus titers. twenty-week-old wild-type mice were intranasally inoculated with either PBS or EGFR ligands. mice were monitored for weight loss every day. if EGFR ligand expression remains persistent, it may lead to fibrosis. 20-week-old wild-type mice were administered AREG and HB-EGF protein at the time of SARS-CoV(MA15) infection. mice were monitored daily for survival and weight loss. a dysregulated EGFR pathway is associated with the development of PF-like disease. mice infected with SARS-CoV(MA15) have increased expression of markers of fibrosis (Timp1, Col3a1 and CCL2) and show a sustained proliferative response in fibroblasts surrounding the airways. this suggests that overactive EGFR signaling remains active in STAT1/ mice after SARS-CoV virus clearance, ultimately resulting in fibrosis. advanced age is a major comorbidity in pulmonary fibrosis caused by SARS-CoV or by other respiratory viruses (50) and in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), where the trigger for the disease is unknown (51). EGFR signaling is a key regulator of SARS-CoV-induced lung damage leading to fibrosis. transgenic mice constitutively overexpressing some of the EGFR ligands tend to spontaneously develop fibrosis (56, 57) the deficiency of some EGFR ligands is beneficial in reducing PF in a bleomycin model (58). studies on influenza A virus show that amphiregulin protects against virus-induced lung pathology in female mice, further complicating the picture.
