{"summary": "infection by more than one variety of microorganism (viruses, bacteria, protozoa, etc.) is termed mixed infection. coinfection is used to describe simultaneous infection of a cell or organism by separate viruses (1). the nature of the host also plays an important role in shaping coinfection patterns. bacterial isolates from a particular geographical region are usually infected more efficiently by bacteriophages isolated from the same niche (15) memory responses generated against one infection may influence the quantity and quality of the immune response to subsequent secondary infection. divergent viruses in a specimen may block replication of the target virus. the detection of the coinfection has been based on serology and virus isolation. the advent of PCR in the 1990s enhanced the specificity of coinfection detection. the presence of a viral genome or antigen in a clinical specimen does not always warrant virus isolation (22, 23) it is likely that due to a difference in the rates of replication or due to viral interference, one of the viruses will be eliminated before appearance of cytopathic effects (24) adsorption of hemagglutinating virus is difficult to achieve. but at lower passage levels, virus may not form CPE, and at higher passage, when it starts forming CPE, defective interfering particles may appear. defective interfering (DI) particles are produced following high-multiplicity-of-infection (high-MOI) passage of a virus in cell culture. DI particles have a defective or deleted genome, replicate quite rapidly compared to the wild-type (WT) virus. the RNA delivery method allows elimination of the DI genome (14) is considered more suitable than antiserum treatment for purification of positive-sense RNA viruses from mixed culture. a single cell line is not always suitable for isolating multiple viruses, but cocultured and genetically modified cell lines have made it possible to simultaneously isolate multiple viruses. both R-Mix and R-MixToo cells facilitate growth of influenza viruses (51, 52) and provide a faster and sensitive cell culture system for isolation of respiratory viral agents. the times needed for positive cultures are 1.4 and 5.2 days, respectively, for R-Mix and single culture (46, 52) ELVIS uses an HSV promoter sequence (UL39 gene) in association with Escherichia coli lacZ. transactivators strongly activate the promoter (55) to induce -galactosidase. BHKICP6 transgenic cell lines can detect virus within 16 to 24 h. hemadsorption is applicable to those viruses that express hemagglutinin proteins on the plasma membrane of infected cells. examples include members of the family Orthomyxoviridae and Paramyxoviridae. qRT-PCR is labor-intensive and expensive, particularly for the detection of multiple viral agents. high-throughput and automated detection platforms (92\u201395) combined magnetic separation technology with a chemiluminescence technique for more sensitive (as low as 10 viral RNA copies) detection of multiple viral agents (82). the technique involved simultaneous extraction of the viral nucleic acid and amplification of the viral genomes in a single tube by qRT-PCR. ViroCap is a test system developed recently (119) that is based on a targeted sequence panel to enrich viral genomes and includes 190 viral genera and 337 species. compared to ViroCap, ViroCap increases virus detection by >50%. ViroCap has the potential to reduce sequencing cost and is flexible. new viral sequences may be periodically added to increase representation of viruses in the shotgun library. it may take a few years until it is available for clinical use. virus purification from mixed culture remains a challenge. cryptic viral agents may also be acquired accidently during in vitro propagation. it is not possible to detect such divergent viruses by virus by virus. the presence of a viral genome or antigen in a clinical specimen does not always warrant virus isolation. the presence of a viral genome or antigen in a clinical specimen is a major bottleneck in cases of coinfections. organic solvents (25), (ii) hemagglutination to separate a hemagglutinating virus, (iii) endpoint dilution assay to separate a hemagglutinating virus, (iv) antibody (Ab) neutralization to eliminate other confecting viruses, (26), (vi) plaque assay to purify single or multiple viruses, and (vii) transfection of the viral RNA mixture into target cells. amplification of only in cell culture adaptation, viruses usually do not show cytopathic effects (CPE) and so plaque purification is not feasible. later, when CPE is evident, all coinfecting viruses may not contribute to CPE formation, thus allowing purification of only CPE-forming virus. further blind passages may be required until noncytolytic virus does become cytolytic (14). transfecting viral RNA (derived from clinical specimens) into primary cells may sometimes show rapid CPE (36, 37), although the reduced amount of viral RNA may require additional passages until CPE becomes observable in primary cells (36). the RNA delivery method, which allows elimination of the DI genome (14), is considered more suitable than antiserum treatment for purification of positive-sense RNA viruses from mixed cultures. viruses with positive-sense RNA genomes can generate infectious virus upon delivery of their viral RNA into host cells. this property may be exploited to eliminate negative-sense RNA viruses from mixed cultures. but in most instances, viral RNA derived only from the cell culture-adapted viruses produces CPE in the established cell lines (14) a mixture of MRC-5 and A549 cells is useful to detect cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV) and adenovirus in the same specimen. a combination of mink lung and human adenocarcinoma cells (R-Mix cells) is useful for the rapid isolation of respiratory viruses (parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3, influenza A and B viruses. 1 cells facilitate multiplex detection of HSV-1, HSV-2, and varicella-zoster virus (VZV) (53, 54) the CPE formed in these cocultured cell lines is as sensitive as fluorescence-based assays (54) BHKICP6 transgenic cell lines can detect virus within 16 to 24 h (59) human embryonic lung fibroblasts, primary monkey kidney, and BGMK cells are generally used for enterovirus isolation, and these produce CPE within 5 days (62). compared to wild-type BGMK cells, BGMK-hDAF, a genetically engineered cell line expressing human decay-accelerating factor (hDAF) can enhance enterovirus detection (64, 65) a mixture of MRC-5 and A549 cells is useful to detect cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV) and adenovirus in the same specimen and can be as sensitive as immunofluorescence or isolation in a single cell type. a coculture of mink lung and human adenocarcinoma cells (R-Mix cells) is useful for the rapid isolation of respiratory viruses. cocultured cells are adequate for concurrent isolation of peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) and foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) (14) cocultured cell lines are also quite sensitive for the detection/isolation of viral agents with a very low virus titer and those which grow slowly (42) but their cost is usually higher than that of a single-cell culture (42). type, coculturing these cells has enhanced the possibility of virus isolation (63, 64) sensitivity of these cell lines was further increased by coculturing BGMK-hDAF with CaCo-2 (BGMK-hDAF/CaCo-2) hemadsorption is useful approach to detect viruses which produce slow or no CPE in cultured cells. a chemiluminescent label-based assay (83, 84) is preferred over fluorescence-based detection (90, 91) because of their easy manipulation under an external magnetic field, surface-modified magnetic particles can be used for enrichment of the target molecules. this permits high-throughput and automated detection platforms (92\u201395) the cost of NGS is sharply declining, and in the future it may be competitive with current diagnostic assays (107). ViroCap (probe enrichment) often fails to detect viruses detectable by PCR (118) and may not produce sufficient data for comprehensive analysis. 1 billion bp of annotated viral genome sequences was reduced to 200 million bp of targets. this process involves hybridization of DNA/RNA probes to the cDNA fragments in a shotgun library. ViroCap increases virus detection by >50% compared to the known vertebrate viruses. qRT-PCR is labor-intensive and expensive, particularly for the detection of multiple viral agents. adsorption and fluorescence spectra for different fluorophores used in fluorescent-labeled probe systems tend to interfere with each other. chemiluminescent label-based assays are preferred over fluorescence-based detection. NGS detects sequences from almost all potential organisms in an unbiased manner. it also allows concurrent genetic characterization of diverse groups of known viruses as well as divergent viruses that evade conventional testing. ViroCap is a test system developed recently (119) that is based on a targeted sequence panel to enrich viral genomes and includes 190 viral genera and 337 species. compared to ViroCap, ViroCap increases virus detection by >50%. PCR amplification results in two heterologous double-stranded DNA products of similar size. homo- and heteroduplexes (nucleotide mismatches) result in altered migration in agarose gel electrophoresis. some of the viruses may be plaque purified, but those which do not form CPE are cumbersome to purify. if the cell line is equally susceptible and the life cycle of the cryptic agent is shorter, the target virus is likely to be eliminated (viral interference) after few passages. coinfections exert a negative effect on health 124. coinfections may modulate viral virulence and cell death. mosquitoes with DNV infection were equally susceptible to infection. iters NDV blocked HPAIV replication 163 WMV and ZYMV Interference Nucleic acid ZYMV inhibited WMV replication 164 Henipavirus and rubulavirus NA Nucleic acid Evidence of dual virus infection in bats 165 SINV and LACV Interference Viral titers Suppression of both viruses but greater suppression of DENV2 142 SINV, SFV and SINV, RRV Exclusion Viral titers Persistent 1/PRV Interference Viral titers Expression of BHV-1 gD inhibited HSV-1, PRV, and BHV-1 replication 172 TTSuV1a and ASFV NA Nucleic acid NA 173 hMPV and hRSV NA NA Increased hospitalization rates in humans 174 HCV and TTV NA Nucleic acid (HMA) NA 120 Fowlpox virus and ILTV NA Viral titers/n nucleic acid/antibody CHIKV and DNV were successfully purified by plaque purification and antibody neutralization.

JEV, Japanese encephalitis virus; LACV, La Crosse virus; LPAIV, low-pathogenic avian influenza virus; NDV IFNs induce multiple so-called interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) Upon binding with cognate receptors, many of which activate numerous cell signaling pathways (127\u2013137) non-interferon-mediated viral interference is a virus-induced cellular state of resistance to subsequent viral infection. deformed wing virus infection 227, 228 RNAi DENV DENV NS4B protein exerted a suppressive effect on RNAi response 232 FHV FHV B2 protein prevented Dicer-2-mediated cleavage of long dsRNA as well as loading of siRNA into RISC 233, 234 Dicistro viruses Encode protein 1A. cDNAs from the defective genome are eventually transcribed by host transcription machinery to produce small ds interference by temp-sensitive mutants Viral mutants that acquire dominance over wild-type virus 238\u2013245 Viral interference usually occurs at specific steps of the virus replication cycle. these include attachment (144, 246\u2013259), entry (217, 260\u2013263), genome replication (167, 217, 231, 264\u2013268), and budding (269). in vivo evidence of superinfection exclusion is rare (279\u2013281) examples include pigs persistently infected with classical swine fever virus (CSFV), which exclude vaccine strains upon challenge infection (282). examples include pigs persistently infected with classical swine fever virus (CSFV) infected K3 cells excluded homologous arenavirus and antigenically related Tacaribe virus with an unknown mechanism 287 Primary virus blocked protein synthesis by the superinfecting virus 277 Classical swine fever virus Dysregulation of innate immune response with an unknown mechanism 279 Influenza A virus Expression of neuraminidase by primary virus blocked secondary virus attachment to the host cells 288 Vaccinia virus Primary virus infection blocked fusion of the viral (secondary virus) and cellular superinfection suppression has been observed between densovirus (DNV) and dengue virus (DENV) persistently DNV-infected cells resist DENV challenge (with a reduced rate of DENV-2 infection, decreased DENV-2 production, and reduced mortality) in insect cells (147, 304). however, the superinfection suppression between DNV and DENV should be called superinfection disease suppression because the most prominent outcome is decreased disease severity rather than decreased viral infection (147). human parainfluenza virus 2 (hPIV2) infection-associated cell fusion facilitated IAV replication and modulated pathological consequences. simultaneous inoculation of culex flavivirus (CxFV) and west Nile virus (WNV) facilitated WNV transmission. persistent viruses have a reduced ability to kill infected cells. compared to naive cells, persistently DNV-infected cells resist CPE formation upon DENV challenge. the molecular mechanism underlying viral persistence is not completely understood. shrimp (148) and shrimp (147, 304, 324, 325) have an immune system. however, persistently infected shrimp only resist viral challenge until they remain infected. there is no system equivalent to immune memory. 5 to 7% of the poliovirus plaque population was found to be associated with multiple parental viruses (333) coinfection with heterologous viruses may also result in altered plaque morphology, as seen with IAV and cowpox virus coinfection in BHK-21 cells. compared to monoinfection, HBV/HCV coinfection results in more severe fibrosis and cirrhosis as well excess liver-related mortality. previous HBV infection has also been shown to significantly enhance the risk of decompensated cirrhosis. both humans and vectors (insects) are infected by multiple DENV subtypes (359\u2013362) in the former, virus is cleared by the immune response, whereas in insects, it may persist for a long time. vectors serve as a mixing vessel for any competition to take place between diverse viral strains. strains of poliovirus have been identified during early periods of excretion. recombination between a persistently infected bovine viral diarrhea virus (noncytopathic form) and a vaccine strain resulted in the formation of a cytopathic form of BVDV. this led to lethal mucosal disease (376) if wild-type SFV was added 15 min after SFV-tr, fewer than 30% of cells were infected. infection with FMDV at 12 h after vaccinia virus superinfection induced viral interference (14) the efficiency of viral interference also depends on the virus dose. HTLV, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and CMV share similarity with the HIV-1 cellular receptor CD4+ present on T helper lymphocytes (380). route of infection also impacts the consequences of viral coinfections. coinfecting viruses with longer cycles will be prematurely terminated. in BPXV/NDV coinfection, the relatively long replication cycle of PPRV led to its removal upon long-term cell culture passage in vero cells. the interference occurred intracellularly without any role of DI particles or interferons and was directed exclusively against FMDV (139) in non-interferon-mediated viral interference, competition between two viruses exists for the metabolites, replication sites, or those host factors that support virus replication. 172 Poxviruses Heterodimers formed by viral A56 and K2 proteins at the cell surface resisted superinfection 229, 230 WNV Long-term incubation of superinfecting virus with primary virus-containing cells resisted superinfection 231 Competition for cellular factors DENV2 and DENV4 coinfection of mosquito cells resulted in reduced replication of both viral strains 142 Nonspecific dsRNA Administration of both sequence-specific and non-seque superinfection exclusion is a phenomenon by which an established viral infection interferes with a second, closely related virus infection (159) this phenomenon occurs in both plant and animal viruses (270\u2013272) and has important consequences for virus replication, pathogenesis, and evolution. it affects genome diversification, antiviral drug resistance, and evasion of vaccine-mediated immune responses. superinfection exclusion Virus Mechanism of exclusion Reference(s) Bovine viral diarrhea virus Primary virus blocked entry and RNA synthesis of the superinfecting virus 283 Hepatitis C virus Presence of primary virus RNA/proteins resisted superinfection 266, 275 Rubella virus Exclusion occurred after entry but before accumulation of detectable amt of viral RNA 267 Semliki Forest virus Superinfection exclusion occurs at the level of binding and endosomal fusion 217 Sind 289 primary virus gene products inhibit early gene expression by the superinfecting virus 271, 290\u2013292 Heterodimer formed by the primary viral proteins (A56 and K2) at the cell surface inhibited secondary virus entry 293\u2013296 Alphaherpesviruses (HSV, PRV, and EHV) Expression of immediate early viral genes resists superinfection with unknown mechanisms 300 PIV3 and NDV Primary virus hemagglutinin-neuraminidase ietic necrosis virus or (IHHNV) and white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) (176) should be referred to as superinfection disease suppression because the most prominent outcome is decreased disease severity rather than decreased viral infection (147). the poliovirus vaccine strain is known to restrict the growth of standard (WT) virus (305), later, following vaccination, this interference is achieved by stimulating antibody production that restricts the growth of the secondary virus. persistently infected (with JUNV) cells did exclude superinfecting homologous or antigenically related arenavirus (277). pigs persistently infected with classical swine fever virus (CSFV), which exclude vaccine strains upon immunization (282). infecting virus at the level of viral entry by downregulating CCR5, the major HIV-1 coreceptors 248, 254 Vaccinia virus Superinfecting virus is unable to carry out its DNA synthesis and early gene transcription 271 west Nile virus Competition for the cellular factors that are required for synthesis of the viral genome 231 Junin virus. es Primary virus infection inhibited budding of the superinfecting virus 269 Citrus tristeza virus Viral protein p33 mediates superinfection exclusion with an unknown mechanism 272, 273 Deformed wing virus (lethal and nonlethal types) lethal infection results in death of honey bees; prior infection with nonlethal DNV resists superinfection by a lethal deformed wing virus 303 Superinfection suppression. coinfections involving viruses may have several virological consequences. interference between closely related viruses eventually results in elimination of the secondary coinfecting virus and is referred to as superinfection exclusion. persistently infected cells harbor virus for long times without clearance (1), thereby facilitating viral transmission to new hosts (236). persistent viruses dominate over the parental virus in acute infections (245) viral DNA is steadily transcribed and produces dsRNA. blocking of reverse transcription prevents the emergence of chimeric DNA. there is little evidence that shrimp or other arthropods possess an immune system. change in Virus Phenotype Plaque assay is one of the most common methods to quantify virus particles. it is generally believed that a plaque represents a single infectious unit. however, a recent study has demonstrated that a plaque may contain multiple parental viruses. SV and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) (174), IAV (344), and multiple respiratory viral agents (345). a less severe clinical impact of viral coinfections has also been reported. compared to monoinfection, HBV/HCV coinfection results in more severe fibrosis and cirrhosis. a competition to succeed among multiple viral strains must be prevalent in the same geographical region, infect corresponding hosts, and target the same cells within that host. in nature, both humans and vectors (insects) are infected by multiple DENV subtypes (359\u2013362) pandemics in 1957, 1968, and 2009 all emerged from reassortment of viral segments. the efficiency with which a given neuraminidase removes sialic acid receptors determines reassortment between two or more viruses. however, the addition of an NA inhibitor in virus-infected cells can reduce viral titers and enhance superinfection. the time gap between coinfecting viruses is a major factor. if wild-type SFV was added 15 min after SFV-tr, fewer than 30% of cells were infected. infection with FMDV at 12 h after vaccinia virus superinfection induced viral interference. Vpu and Env were found to more significantly affect downmodulation of the CD4+ in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) than in the Jurkat T cells (274), suggesting a role of cell type in viral interference (379). sperm proteins, human T-lymphotrophic virus (HTLV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and CMV share similarity with the HIV-1 cellular receptor CD4+ present on 380. the propensity for viral coinfection was greater in children aged 6 to 24 months than in infants (347) the 13- to 24-month age group had relatively higher rates of viral coinfections than the 8-to 12-month or 25-to 36-month age group. if coinfecting viruses significantly vary in replication cycle length, the one with shorter life cycle will persist. fewer than 30% of cells were infected after SFV-tr. infection with FMDV at 12 h after vaccinia virus superinfection induced viral interference. the efficiency of viral interference also depends on the virus dose. -1 cellular receptor CD4+ present on sperm or other coinfecting viruses. route of infection also impacts consequences of viral coinfections. coinfections are more commonly observed in children than in adults. in buffalopox virus (BPXV) infection, evidence of both peak virus titers and CPE formation is observed at 48 h postinfection (hpi) in BPXV, faster CPE formation by BPXV eliminated PPRV on long-term passage (14) in vero cells. heterologous infections result in protective immunity by employing mechanisms that include innate immune activation (389), bystander protection by activated CD4+ or CD8+ T cells (388), and cross-reactive CD8+ T cells (390). in some instances, heterologous infections result in an unaltered immune response, suggesting that the viral coinfection had no significant consequences. response is generated, which helps in antigen clearance. a low dose of the virus generated strong effector T-cell responses. this preventing collateral damage due to the excessive cytokine production by the activated effector T cells. intermediate viral doses could elicit an immune response with a lower rate of exhaustion and provided sufficient time for profound collateral damage to occur in the lung and liver. the net outcome depends upon the stage at which a subsequent viral pathogen is encountered. primary virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are also known in some cases to provide bystander protection against the subsequent pathogen. inversely, the incoming pathogen can result in attrition (type 1 IFN dependent) of preexisting memory CD8+ T cells. inflammatory cascades are triggered that eventually results in secretion of cytokines and chemokines, activation of antigen-presenting cells (APCs), and recruitment of innate immune cells. prior infection of the host may lead to APC activation. these activated APCs undergo cytokine secretion that eventually drives TH subset differentiation. a preexisting polarized T helper immune response generated against primary virus infection may induce bystander protective immunity. Treg depletion at acute and memory stages of an antiviral immune response may lead to enhanced CD8+ T-cell responses (400) Upon IAV infection, the expanded Treg affect the nature and magnitude of the effector responses, as well as their contribution to lung immunopathology. LCMV-specific CD8+ T cells were overactivated and partially exhausted in mice immune to IAV and infected with LCMV. the drastic decrease in lung pathology upon Treg depletion was attributed to the fact that the LCMV-specific CD8+ T cells were overactivated and subsequently partially exhausted. in a mouse model of coinfections, CMV infection conferred protection against IAV infection. the mechanism of this CMV-mediated beneficial effect was attributed to the bystander protection offered by the IFN- (produced from CMV-specific CD8+ T cells) more than one class of interferons can also induce erosion of preexisting memory. a cell surface receptor known as programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) promotes apoptosis. PD1 suppresses autoimmunity by depletion of autoreactive CD8+ T cells in mice. some researchers support attrition because the space in the lymphoid compartment is finite. but others do not support attrition, and theories are proposed to explain both facets. it was argued whether virus-specific CD4+ memory T cells undergo attrition upon heterologous virus infection. naive hosts respond quite differently to antigen exposure than an antigen (heterologous)-experienced host. the presence of antigenically experienced cross-reactive CD8+ T cells contributes to altered epitope-specific hierarchies. immune and LCMV-immune mice with PICV resulted in a narrow oligoclonal repertoire with clones having unpredictable TCR sequences. cross-reactive CD8+ T cells proliferated after heterologous challenge, and the expected TCR motifs were observed. cross-reactive immune responses in viral coinfections can inhibit or augment the growth of new incoming pathogen (431) cross-reactivity could protect under conditions where a large number of pathogenic antigens and a limited TCR repertoire mounted by the host occur. cross-reactive CD8+ T-cell response were shown to occur during coinfection with multiple homologous strains, such as in IAV and DENV strains. specific antibodies are well known to clear virus infection; however, a subneutralizing amount of antibodies can also augment virus infection and therefore disease severity. ADE occurs in patients who have preexisting antiviral immunity and are exposed to a heterologous virus. cross-reactive antibodies are hypothesized to promote DENV infection. the association between the presence of coinfection and increased/decreased disease severity is still unclear. an adequate diagnostic procedure investigating diverse groups of viral pathogens is important for appropriate therapy (439) in coinfected individuals, treatment demands judicious implementation of the therapeutic regime (440) vaccines lacking cross-reactive epitopes (391) could be supplemented to formulate effective vaccination strategies (449) heterologous challenge can lead to erosion of the memory CD8+ T cells generated against the previously experienced antigen. this could mean that new incoming heterologous infection would displace the preexisting memory CD8+ T cells generated against the target pathogen by vaccination. the induction of cross-reactivity and attrition are major concerns in vaccination. such vaccines reduce the risk of infections and are likely to have heterologous impacts on the immune system. smallpox immunization is advocated to lower the risk of asthma and malignant melanoma. MCMV-immune mice remained fully susceptible to LCMV challenge. virus A affecting responses to virus B but not reverse effect. LCMV-immune mice remained fully susceptible to LCMV challenge. a low dose of the virus generated strong effector T-cell responses that efficiently cleared the virus. high viral doses, on the other hand, resulted in T-cell clonal exhaustion, viral persistence, and limited immunopathology. the net outcome depends upon the stage at which the subsequent pathogen is encountered. bystander protection from IFN- production may also be mediated under conditions where subsequent heterologous infection occurs during an ongoing effector CD8+ T-cell response. inversely, the incoming pathogen can result in attrition of preexisting memory CD8+ T cells. subsequent secondary infection of the persistently infected host may culminate in an altered immune response. polarized T cells exert innumerable activities in antiviral immunity. prior infection of the host may lead to APC activation. Treg expand during viral infection, with an enhanced suppressive function (400) such Treg can alter the magnitude and other features of effector T-cell responses and limit immunopathology upon exposure to subsequent heterologous infection. this Treg-mediated impact either may positively influence the outcome or can be detrimental to the host. the study thus confirmed the established role of Treg in regulating effector T-cell exit from lymph nodes. there was no enhancement of virus-specific effector responses when IAV-expanded Treg were depleted during LCMV infection (414, 415) LCMV-specific CD8+ T cells were overactivated and partially exhausted in mice immune to IAV and infected with LCMV. heterologous LCMV infection resulted in altered Treg kinetics. this led to higher viral loads, increased proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine levels in the lungs, and ultimately immunopathology (409) incoming heterologous infection may deplete preexisting CD8+ T cells. this is referred to as attrition (418, 419) more than one class of interferons can also induce erosion of preexisting memory. measles virus provides long-lasting protective immunity in humans (65 years) memory B cells persist for an indefinite period after smallpox immunization, suggesting that memory responses do not need to erode rapidly. primary infection may lead to higher viral loads and increased immunopathology. primary infection may lead to maturation of the APCs that eventually augment antigen presentation upon subsequent viral infection. polarized T cells exert innumerable activities in antiviral immunity. an exacerbated immune response to viral infections is controlled by several regulatory mechanisms. these regulatory mechanisms include the expansion of regulatory T cells (399, 400) and various inhibitory protein-mediated interactions. for example, the PD1-PDL1 axis (406) and CTLA-4 and CD80/86 (406) interactions strongly influence the outcome. the LCMV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses in the spleen were significantly reduced but not those in the mesenteric lymph nodes. the study thus confirmed the established role of Treg in regulating effector T-cell exit from lymph nodes. mmune mice compared to those in naive or LCMV-immune mice. LCMV infection provided peak CD4+ cells, CD8+ cells, and Treg. this led to higher viral loads, increased proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine levels in the lungs. 8+ T-cell-mediated protective immunity was completely abrogated in mice. increased CD8+ T-cell responses were observed upon secondary heterologous infection by WNV, IAV, or human herpesvirus 1 (416) simultaneous infection of gammaherpesvirus and influenza viruses resulted in enhanced numbers of lymphocytes in peripheral blood. PD1 suppression was found to be upregulated by CMV-specific CD8+ T cells. blockade of the PD1 pathway by anti-PDL1 antibody restored the proliferation and cytokine secretion by these CMV-specific CD8+ T cells (422) thus, besides type 1 IFN, PD1-mediated apoptosis is yet another mechanism proposed for attrition. Adaptive immunity is defined by the fact that a unique T-cell repertoire is established to a wide range of immunodominant epitopes. the majority of the antiviral cytotoxic T lymphocyte subsets target only a few peptide/MHC class I complexes. a diverse TCR repertoire benefits the host in combating a large number of pathogens. a heterologous infection can lead to the broadening of an otherwise narrow repertoire by recruiting the nondominant clones but at the same time could narrow the repertoire due to cross-reactivity. cross-reactivity is the capacity of the TCR to recognize multiple peptide/MHC complexes. cross-reactivity may be advantageous as well as disadvantageous for the host. cross-reactivity could be advantageous as well as disadvantageous for the host. cross-reactive antiviral antibodies are hypothesized to promote DENV infection and antigenemia. cross-reactive antiviral antibodies are hypothesized to promote deNV infection. cross-reactive antiviral antibodies are hypothesized to promote deNV infection. cross-reactive, dysfunctional T-cell responses may also contribute to enhancing disease severity (435, 436) there is speculation that preexisting cross-reactive T cells and DENV antibodies can facilitate ZIKV infection. the cross-reactive antibodies against DENV and Zika virus facilitated ZIKV replication and lethality. antiviral cytotoxic T lymphocytes are targeted by antiviral cytotoxic T lymphocytes is known as immunodominance. naive hosts respond quite differently to antigen exposure than an antigen-experienced host. the presence of antigenically experienced cross-reactive CD8+ T cells contributes to altered epitope-specific hierarchies. heterologous infection resulted in a narrow oligoclonal repertoire with clones having unpredictable TCR sequences. non-cross-reactive epitope-containing TCR repertoires were unaffected. cross-reactive CD8+ T cells proliferated after heterologous challenge. cross-reactivity may be advantageous as well as disadvantageous for the host. cross-reactivity could protect under conditions where a large number of pathogenic antigens and a limited TCR repertoire mounted by the host occur. cross-reactivity may involve narrowing the TCR repertoire and consequently viral escape (428) cross-reactive memory cells elicited by past exposure to infection could influence immune response to other infectious agents. cross-reactive antiviral antibodies bind to virion particles and facilitate infection of cells expressing Fc- receptors (Fc-Rs), including macrophages, monocytes, and some dendritic cell subsets. a higher incidence of ZIKV infection with more severe clinical manifestations (congenital malformations) was noticed in areas with a prior flavivirus infection, which could be explained by ADE. an adequate diagnostic procedure investigating diverse groups of viral pathogens is important for appropriate therapy (439) vaccines lacking cross-reactive epitopes (391) could be supplemented to formulate effective vaccination strategies (449) heterologous challenge can lead to erosion of the memory CD8+ T cells generated against the previously experienced antigen. this could mean that new incoming heterologous infection would displace the preexisting memory CD8+ T cells generated against the target pathogen by vaccination. the prime-boost vaccination strategy mainly induced effector memory CD8+ T cells that reside within the nonlymphoid compartment (423). however, it is noteworthy that vaccines which generate a strong interferon response could end up in causing attrition of preexisting memory CD8+ T cells. anti-TNF therapy can be employed to prevent severe immunopathology. if an immunopathological outcome is expected in diagnosed coinfections, appropriate interventions can be employed to prevent severe immunopathology. heterologous challenge can lead to erosion of memory CD8+ T cells. this could be explained by space restrictions within the immune compartment. this could mean that new incoming heterologous infection would displace the preexisting memory CD8+ T cells generated against the target pathogen by vaccination. the measles vaccine has an additional advantage; it could provide protective immunity against other, unrelated infections. if the measles vaccine was followed by an inactivated diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis DTP vaccine (452) mathematical models of viral coinfections have also been developed. Rong et al. (462) presented a mathematical model for drug-sensitive and drug-resistant HCV. the model concluded that viral mutations acquired during the course of drug therapy have no major impact on the dynamics of different viral strains. nonpathogenic divergent viruses present in clinical specimens may influence detection of pathogenic viruses. in vitro and in vivo propagation of viruses also produces subgenomic viral particles (DI particles) that in some affect phenotypic and virulence properties of heterologous viruses during coinfection."}
