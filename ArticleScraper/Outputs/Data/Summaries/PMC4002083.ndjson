{"summary": "translation of mRNAs is a prominent site of gene regulation that occurs at the step of translational initiation. in eukaryotes, there is only a limited number of examples of RNAs using alternative initiation mechanisms or coding for more than one protein. however, such principles are quite commonly found in viral RNAs. a 3\u2032-terminal, small ORF codes for the minor capsid protein VP2 with a size that varies among the caliciviruses from 8 to 20 kDa (34) the major capsid protein VP1 is encoded by a separate ORF2 in members of the genera Vesivirus and norovirus. the genomic RNA serves as a template for the synthesis of the nonstructural polyprotein. huNV genome contains two TURBS, one at the border polymerase (ORF1) and one at the border VP1 (ORF2)/VP2 (ORF3). huNV genome contains two TURBS, one at the border polymerase (ORF1)/VP1 (ORF2) and one at the border VP2 (ORF3). motif 1 (UGGGA) is found to be conserved among caliciviruses. it is located at similar positions in the mRNAs of the different caliciviruses. a complementary sequence to motif 2 is located directly upstream of motif 1. huNV coding regions for constructs pNVWT and pNPWT were generated by PCR from a full-length cDNA clone. the huNV sequences were inserted into a two-tag construct with a 5\u2032 Pep6- and a 3\u2032 V5-His6 tag sequence (pSK-cLC3 with a multiple cloning site inserted between the tag coding regions (44). pNVCdM lacking all internal methionine codons was established synthetically (Invitrogen) for easier detection, the methionine codons were replaced by cysteine codons, and the codons coding for the C-terminal residues 107\u2013268 of VP2 were deleted. huNV proteins were precipitated with the Pep6 antisera (44) and V5 antisera (Invitrogen) the 4\u20135-fold volume of cell lysate was used for precipitation of the protein resulting from translation of the second frame compared with that for precipitation of the first frame. sequence on top represents the TURBS of huNV as determined by sequence analysis. motif 1 (m1), the stop codon of the VP1 coding ORF and the start codon of the VP2 coding sequence are underlined. the complementary motifs 2* (m2*) and motif 2 (m2) are written in boldface. deduced VP2 amino acid sequence starting with the Met encoded by the original start site is given. the amino acid encoded by the altered codon plus the residue upstream thereof is given. aUG in WT as well as the residues altered in the mutants are highlighted in boldface. the calculated VP2 expression efficiencies in percent and the standard deviations (sd) are given below the autoradiographs (relative to pNVWT, normalized to the expression level of Pep6-VP1*).

TS/TS is shown in bold face and underlined. below, sequences of the stop and/or start mutants are given with the original stop/start site highlighted in bold face and underlined. translation of VP1 and VP2 was analyzed in vaccinia virus-infected BHK cells. the vaccinia virus infection prior to transfection of the different cDNA constructs provides T7-RNA polymerase that ensures transcription of the desired RNAs. the mechanism used for initiating translation of the upstream frame has no influence on the principles of reinitiation. the calculated reinitiation frequency for the huNV system was 3% of the VP1 translation rate. substitution mutants were generated and analyzed for each of the essential regions. a gel with the proteins precipitated after transient expression of the wild type construct pNVWT is shown. single substitutions within motif 1 interfering with proposed hybridization with 18 S rRNA led to a prominent reduction of VP2 translation (NV14 and NV15, Fig. 3). a mutation at the same position as in NV14 but still allowing hybridization with the 18 S rRNA via a G-U pairing showed a WT level of VP2 translation. reinitiation occurs at a lower level on non-AUG codons. an AUG as start codon is not essential for reinitiation. most substitutions within the NV-VP2 start codon led to a mild decrease of VP2 translation. pNVCdM mutants were tested in transient expression studies with [35S]Met. a labeled product can only be detected when translation starts with methionine followed by a large residue that prevents removal of the initiator Met. pNV2CdM is expected to yield products without Met when translation starts at the original start site. reinitiation product does not start at the AUU. the original start site was mutated to AGA (construct pNV2_1CdM) reinitiation at the original start site would result in a labeled protein. mutants were established in the background of the WT construct pNVWT. mutation of the original start codon to AGU (NV42) led to a further reduction of the VP2 level (15%) compared with the start codon single mutant NV2 (38%). reduction from 38 to 15% is most likely founded in the loss of reinitiation at the AUA. the sequence surrounding the start codon was changed from a good (3 = A, +4 = G) to a poor Kozak consensus sequence (3 = C, +4 = U, NV58, Fig. 4C) the reinitiation rate observed for this mutant is like wild type (111%). for these constructs just a mild reduction of reinitiation efficiency to levels between 70 and 90% that might not even be statistically significant. pNV59WT, pNV59, and pNV62 were compared to in-frame insertions of 3 or 6 nt. this finding is further proof of the fact that reinitiation represents true de novo initiation of translation. pNV59WT encodes an RNA that contains the original start codon together with the downstream out of frame AUG. pNV59 does not yield significant level of reinitiation product in the VP2 frame. to further support this point, we established a series of expression constructs with newly created AUG codons. these AUGs were located at different downstream positions ranging from codon position 3\u201333 of the VP2 frame. this approach was supposed to allow differentiation of initiation at the original start site from the translational start at a downstream AUG. the total reinitiation rate is around 90% of the WT level for the constructs with a mutated original start site and the new AUG at codons 3 or 4. it cannot be distinguished whether reinitiation occurs here almost exclusively at the newly created downstream AUG or at the original start site and the downstream AUG. a new band was detected after expression of NV57 that could start at the next AUG located at position 78. substitution of a downstream codon by AUG did not result in detection of the shortened VP2-V5 protein. both of the transcripts derived from these constructs have a new engineered AUG at the VP2 codon position +24. the amount of the protein initiated at the downstream AUG decreased from 10 to 2% for a good or bad Kozak context. therefore, initiation at downstream sites relies at least in part on a different mechanism than initiation at the stop/start site. it was therefore important to investigate whether translational start at downstream sites is still a reinitiation event. frame 1 is the VP2 coding frame. frame 3 has no AUG codon in the vicinity of the original VP2 start site. pNV56agu contained the AU1 tag and a mutated original VP2 start codon. reinitiation occurs at three sites. the dominant band results from initiation at the mutated original start site. the two bands of lower intensity are initiated downstream at the next AUG in the VP2 coding frame. mutation of original start codon leads to reduction of reinitiation efficiency. mutant T-/TS lacking original start codon shows reinitiation even further downstream. this finding reveals reinitiation even further downstream, most likely at the AUG at position 63. reinitiation at the second start site is no longer detectable when this AUG is substituted to AGU (-S/T-, Fig. 9). reinitiation in the original stop/start region is still observed, despite the fact that termination takes place 15 codons further downstream and the original start codon is mutated. reinitiation in the original stop/start region is still observed. two sets of constructs were generated with the WT+ constructs containing the original start codon together with an AUG codon a few codons further downstream. the WT and M constructs display the same sequences as WT+ and M+, respectively, but without the downstream AUG. initiation for VP1 translation at the first or second AUG of the wild type sequence is indicated within the gel by 1 or 2 respectively. pCH1 (WT) contains the VP1 and VP2 coding frames. despite the mutation, initiation obviously took place at the altered original start site. to prove that the downstream initiation product would have been detected, we engineered constructs for separate expression of the WT VP2 frame product and the polypeptide that would be generated by downstream initiation. to exclude that the position chosen for the introduced downstream AUG is not suitable for reinitiation, we also tested AUG codons engineered at two other positions, codon +4 or +7 of the VP2 coding frame. but also for these mutants the initiation of translation at the engineered downstream a downstream AUG at codon 8 of the VP1 frame led to reinitiation at this engineered start site. the stop codon of the VP1 coding region is located upstream of the start codon of the VP2 gene. this arrangement differs from what is found at the equivalent site in other caliciviruses. expression construct pNVCdM is expected to yield products without pNV2CdM. pNV2CdM is expected to yield products without pNV2CdM. translation of the reinitiation product does not start at the AUU. reinitiation at the original start site would result in a labeled protein now. reinitiation at the original start site would again not lead to a Met-labeled product. mutants were established in the background of the WT construct pNVWT. Mutation of the AUA codon to GUA and mutation of the original start codon to AGU (NV42) led to a further reduction of the VP2 level (15%) compared with the start codon single mutant NV2 (38%) reduction from 38 to 15% is most likely founded in the loss of reinitiation at the AUA. the optimal context is ACCAUGG, in which the underlined positions 3 and +4 are especially important for the reinitiation event in noroviruses. the sequence surrounding the AUG was changed from a good (3 = A, +4 = G) to a poor Kozak consensus sequence (3 = C, +4 = U, NV58, Fig. 4C) the reinitiation rate observed for this mutant is like wild type (111%). the insertion of 1 or 2 nucleotides changed the arrangement of ORFs 2 and 3. however, reinitiation rates comparable with those of in-frame insertions of 3 or 6 nt were found. this finding is further proof of the fact that reinitiation represents true de novo initiation of translation. an AUG located downstream of the original start site can be used for reinitiation when the original AUG is mutated. the results indicated that an AUG located downstream of the original start site can be used for reinitiation when the original AUG is mutated. this approach was supposed to allow differentiation of initiation at the original start site from the translational start at a downstream AUG. 29 can be used for initiation when the original start codon is mutated. most of the initiation processes still occurred within the original stop/start region. but also initiation at the downstream AUG occurred at significant frequency. a new band was detected after expression of NV57 that could start at the next AUG located at position 78. the original start codon is mutated to AGU, whereas NV32aug contains the original AUG start codon in addition to the new one. this is even true for constructs in which the next AUG in the VP2 frame is located 78 codons downstream of the original start site. site in the stop/start region was nearly the same for the NV52 and NV52b RNAs (about 50% compared with the wild type) however, the amount of the protein initiated at the downstream AUG decreased from 10 to 2% for a good or bad Kozak context. initiation at downstream sites relies at least in part on a different mechanism than initiation at the stop/start site. frame 1 contains no AUG codon in the vicinity of the original VP2 start site. pNV56aug contained the AU1 tag in a WT background. pNV56agu contained the AU1 tag and a mutated original VP2 start codon. reinitiation occurs at three sites for the NV56agu construct. the dominant band results from initiation at the mutated original start site. the two bands of lower intensity are initiated downstream at the next AUG in the VP2 coding frame. mutation of original start codon leads to reduction of reinitiation efficiency. mutant T-/TS lacking original start codon shows reinitiation at codon +16. this finding reveals reinitiation even further downstream, most likely at the AUG at position 63. the site, at which reinitiation occurs, is neither linked to the termination site nor relies on the presence of an AUG codon. reinitiation in the original stop/start region is still observed, despite the fact that termination takes place 15 codons further downstream and the original start codon is mutated. two sets of constructs were generated with the WT+ constructs containing the original start codon together with an AUG codon a few codons further downstream. the WT and M constructs display the same sequences as WT+ and M+, respectively, but without the downstream AUG. initiation for VP1 translation at the first or second AUG of the wild type sequence is indicated within the gel by 1 or 2 respectively. pCH1 (WT) contains the VP1 and VP2 coding frames. despite the mutation, initiation obviously took place at the altered original start site. the expected size difference between the products initiated at the standard or downstream sites was similar to that of clearly separated FCV products. to prove that the downstream initiation product would have been detected, we engineered constructs for separate expression of the WT VP2 frame product and the polypeptide that would be generated by downstream initiation. to exclude that the position chosen for the introduced downstream AUG is not suitable for reinitiation, we also tested AUG codons engineered at two other positions, codon +4 or +7 first we analyzed the importance of AUG as initiation codon. an AUG start codon is not essential for reinitiation. most substitutions within the AUG led to a mild decrease of VP2 translation. expression construct pNVCdM is expected to yield products without pNV2CdM. pNV2CdM, the construct corresponding to pNV2 in Fig. 3, is expected to yield products without Met. translation of the reinitiation product does not start at the AUU. the original start site was mutated to AGA (construct pNV2_1CdM) reinitiation at the original start site would result in a labeled protein now. mutants were established in the background of the WT construct pNVWT containing the internal Met codons. mutations of the upstream AUA to GUA led to a further reduction of the VP2 level (15%) compared with the start codon single mutant NV2 (38%). this result shows again that initiation at the AUA occurs only when the original start codon is mutated. the optimal context is ACCAUGG, in which the underlined positions 3 and +4 are especially important for initiation. the sequence surrounding the start codon was changed from a good (3 = A, +4 = G) to a poor Kozak consensus sequence (3 = C, +4 = U, NV58, Fig. 4C) the reinitiation rate observed for this mutant is like wild type (111%). reinitiation at each of these sites cannot be determined. pNV59WT, pNV59, and pNV62 were compared to in-frame insertions of 3 or 6 nt. this finding is further proof that reinitiation represents true de novo initiation of translation. an AUG close to the original start site is preferred over a mutated codon at the original start site. results show that an AUG located downstream of the original start site can be used for reinitiation when the original AUG is mutated. this approach was supposed to allow differentiation of initiation at the original start site from the translational start at a downstream AUG. constructs pNV28 and pNV29 can be used for initiation when the original start codon is mutated. the total reinitiation rate is around 90% of the WT level for the constructs with a mutated original start site and the new AUG at codons 3 or 4. a new band was detected after expression of NV57 that could start at the next AUG located at position 78. both of the transcripts derived from these constructs have a new engineered AUG at the VP2 codon position +24. this is even true for constructs in which the next AUG in the VP2 frame is located 78 codons downstream of the original start site, but with a low efficiency. the initiation rate at the original start site in the stop/start region was nearly the same for the NV52 and NV52b RNAs (about 50% compared with the wild type) however, the amount of the protein initiated at the downstream AUG decreased from 10 to 2% for a good or bad Kozak context, respectively. initiation at downstream sites relies at least in part on a different mechanism than initiation at the stop/start site. pNV56aug contained the AU1 tag in a WT background. pNV56agu contained the AU1 tag and a mutated original VP2 start codon. the latter plasmid revealed a reduced VP2 expression level and some initiation at the second AUG in-frame. translation of the plasmid pNV56agu starts at the downstream AUG in ORF2. the dominant band results from initiation at the mutated original start site. initiation occurs independent of the frame at different AUGs located further downstream. downstream initiation results in a separate protein band (Fig. 9B, construct T-/TS, band marked with asterisk) mutant T-/TS lacking the original start codon shows reinitiation even further downstream. mutation of the original start codon leads to a prominent reduction of the reinitiation rate (Fig. 9B, construct T-/TS, marked with an o) reinitiation at the second start site is no longer detectable when this AUG is substituted to AGU (-S/T-, Fig. 9). reinitiation in the original stop/start region is still observed, despite the fact that termination takes place 15 codons further downstream and the original start codon is mutated. in the genomic RNA of the noroviruses at the polymerase/VP1 border, we analyzed FCV and RHDV sequences for the ability to reinitiate at a downstream AUG. two sets of constructs were generated with the WT+ constructs containing the original start codon together with an AUG codon. 2 represents a construct designed for expression of VP2 (WT) or a version lacking the N-terminal four residues (K5) established for demonstration of the size difference between the two expression products. initiation for VP1 translation at the first or second AUG of the wild type sequence is indicated within the gel by 1 or 2, respectively. the expected size difference between the products initiated at the standard or downstream sites was similar to that of clearly separated FCV products. to prove that the downstream initiation product would have been detected, we engineered constructs for separate expression of the WT VP2 frame product and the polypeptide that would be generated by downstream initiation. to exclude that the position chosen for the introduced downstream AUG is not suitable for reinitiation, we also tested AUG codons engineered at two other positions, codon +4 or +7 engineering of a third AUG at codon 8 did not lead to a third translation product in the wild type sequence (wt+, Fig. 10C) the product starting at the second AUG codon (here ACA) was obviously missing for this start codon mutant (M, Fig. 10C) expression construct pNVCdM is expected to yield products without Met. a labeled product would result from initiation at the AUU at position 2. pNV2CdM is expected to yield products without Met. pNV2_1CdM did not give rise to a detectable amount of Met-labeled VP2-V5. reinitiation at the original start site would result in a labeled protein now. reinitiation at the original start site would again not lead to a Met-labeled product due to the Ala at position +1. mutants were established in the background of the WT construct pNVWT containing the internal Met codons. mutations of the upstream AUA to GUA led to a further reduction of the VP2 level (15%) compared with the start codon single mutant NV2 (38%) reduction from 38 to 15% is most likely founded in the loss of reinitiation at the AUA. the optimal context is ACCAUGG, in which the underlined positions 3 and +4 are especially important for initiation. the sequence surrounding the start codon was changed from a good (3 = A, +4 = G) to a poor Kozak consensus sequence (3 = C, +4 = U, NV58, Fig. 4C) the reinitiation rate observed for this mutant is like wild type (111%) the exact level of reinitiation at each of these sites cannot be determined. the insertion of 1 or 2 nucleotides changed the arrangement of ORFs 2 and 3. however, reinitiation rates comparable with those of in-frame insertions of 3 or 6 nt were found. results show that reinitiation within the NV stop/start region is not dependent on a specific reading frame. an AUG located downstream of the original start site can be used for reinitiation when the original AUG is mutated. this approach was supposed to allow differentiation of initiation at the original start site from the translational start at a downstream AUG. initiation at the downstream AUG occurred at significant frequency. the total reinitiation rate is around 90% of the WT level for the constructs with a mutated original start site and the new AUG at codons 3 or 4 (NV28 and NV29) it cannot be distinguished whether reinitiation occurs here almost exclusively at the newly created downstream AUG. a new band was detected after expression of NV57 that could start at the next AUG located at position 78. both of the transcripts derived from these constructs have a new engineered AUG at the VP2 codon position +24. this is even true for constructs in which the next AUG in the VP2 frame is located 78 codons downstream of the original start site, but with a low efficiency. the initiation rate at the original start site in the stop/start region was nearly the same for the NV52 and NV52b RNAs (about 50% compared with the wild type) however, the amount of the protein initiated at the downstream AUG decreased from 10 to 2% for a good or bad Kozak context. initiation at downstream sites relies at least in part on a different mechanism than initiation at the stop/start site. pNV56aug contained the AU1 tag in a WT background. pNV56agu contained the AU1 tag and a mutated original VP2 start codon. the latter plasmid revealed a reduced VP2 expression level. reinitiation occurs at three sites. the dominant band results from initiation at the mutated original start site. initiation occurs independent of the frame at different AUGs. downstream initiation results in a separate protein band. mutation of the original start codon leads to a reduction of the total reinitiation efficiency. this is also true for mutants with a second stop/start site. this finding reveals reinitiation even further downstream. the site, at which reinitiation occurs, is neither linked to the termination site nor relies on the presence of an AUG codon. reinitiation at the second start site is no longer detectable when this AUG is substituted to AGU (-S/T-, Fig. 9). reinitiation in the original stop/start region is still observed, despite the fact that termination takes place 15 codons further downstream. caliciviruses and the reinitiation site in the genomic RNA of the noroviruses at the polymerase/VP1 border display an arrangement with the stop of the first frame located downstream of the start codon of the second frame. two sets of constructs were generated with the WT+ constructs containing the original start codon together with an AUG codon. the M+ constructs display a mutation of the former triplet together with the downstream AUG. pVP2 represents a construct designed for expression of VP2 (WT) or a version lacking the N-terminal four residues (K5) established for demonstration of the size difference between the two expression products. pCH1 (WT) contains the VP1 and VP2 coding frames. possible start AUGs in the TURBS region are mutated. the expected size difference between the products initiated at the standard or downstream sites was similar to that of clearly separated FCV products. to prove that the downstream initiation product would have been detected, we engineered constructs for separate expression of the WT VP2 frame product and the polypeptide that would be generated by downstream initiation. substitution of a third AUG at codon 8 did not lead to a third translation product in the wild type sequence (wt+, Fig. 10C) substitution of both original start AUGs led to reduced VP1 expression, and the product starting at the second AUG codon (here ACA) was obviously missing for this start codon mutant. the importance of the three essential TURBS motifs was first shown for the FCV and RHDV VP1-VP2 TURBS and later on for bovine and murine norovirus. in all viral TURBS, the two coding frames overlap in a small region. how is the start site for reinitiation determined\" why do only a few ribosomes reinitiate translation after termination of upstream frame translation\" mutations affecting the start codon have in general a stronger effect in RHDV than in FCV, huNV, and influenza B. however, there is still a significant rate of initiation in the different viruses. reinitiation depends on a Met-tRNA and therefore represents a de novo initiation (23). the distance from an essential element of the TURBS defines the start site. the termination signal is essential for reinitiation but can be moved downstream leading to a less efficient but still prominent level of reinitiation. this is even true for mutants where the total stop/start site is moved. ribosomes recruited by the HCV IRES cannot reach downstream start sites (55). eIF2 is not necessary for translation initiation driven by HCV-like IRESs or the 5\u2032-nontranslated regions of Sindbis 26 S mRNA. it is not known whether the factors described above are or can also be active in TURBS-driven reinitiation. a significant number of ribosomes reinitiate at the engineered downstream site. the ribosome has to move along the RNA in a 3\u2032 direction. this is reminiscent of the scanning process in standard cap-dependent translation initiation. P\u00f6yry et al. (26) for FCV and Powell et al. (50) for influenza B virus have shown that downstream initiation is not dependent on the scaffold initiation factor eIF4G. this finding suggests that downstream initiation can be located in a scanning-independent manner in influenza B virus."}
