{"summary": "460 blood samples of unvaccinated backyard chickens in the mentioned area were tested for antibodies against IBV using commercial ELISA. phylogenetic study revealed that the detected genotypes had high homology with IBV strains in the backyard flocks. IBV is a major poultry pathogen that is endemic worldwide. IB has been reported in peafowl, teal, partridge, turkey, pheasant, racing pigeon and guinea fowl. chickens from different households may mix, potentially exposing them to different diseases. no preventive and controlling strategy has been undertaken against IB in backyard chickens in Iran (10\u201312) titers were assayed for IBV antibodies using a commercially available blocking ELISA (Biocheck) laboratory results of IBV ELISA were entered and managed using the same program. first round amplification was performed in a final volume of 20 L (2 L D.W, 13 L Sinaclon 2X PCR master mix (Sinaclon, Iran), 2 L of SX1 and SX2 primers and 3 L of cDNA. reaction mixture was the same as the previous PCR using nested primers (SX3 & SX4) Mazandaran province is one of the 31 provinces of Iran. it is located along the Caspian Sea in Iran\u2019s Region 3. for serology, we collected 460 sera from backyard chickens. the extracted viral RNA was contained in a 1.5 mL sterile RNase and DNase-free microtube and stored at 70\u00b0C until further use. cDNAs were stored at 20\u00b0C until further use. amplifications were performed in an Eppendorf master cycler gradient thermocycler (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) reactions (20 uL) were performed using 1 uL of the first PCR product. reaction mixture was the same as the previous PCR using nested primers. the phylogeny of the IBVs strains isolated in Iran and their relationship to other representative IBV strains were assessed based on sequence analysis of the S gene variable region. their phylogenetic relationships were compared with sequences available in GenBank and the representatives of the different genotypes. IBV: 793/B (67.7%), (2) Variant 2 (25.8%), and (3) QX (6.5%) detected isolates in this study had 100%, 98%, and 99.35% to 100% homology. also, Variant 2 genotype had 97.71% homology with IS/1494/06 (HM131453) isolate. 82.01 82.73 78.67 79.11 79.11 79.11 79.11 H120 (JN600610) 81.91 81.91 80.31 81.46 74.22 75.16 75.16 75.16 75.16 QX (AF193423) 83.59 83.59 96.71 98.70 81.17 82.01 80.28 80.28 80.28 80.41 82 68% prevalence and 1427 titer average were announced using IDEXX kit (17) the mean titer of chickens was around 4949 in this area. the studied chicks showed no clinical signs and vaccination history based on veterinary history and owner claims. this was the first QX tracing in Iran backyard poultry. the prevalence of Variant 2 was 25.8% in this study and had high homology with Variant 2 viruses circulating in commercial flocks of Iran."}
