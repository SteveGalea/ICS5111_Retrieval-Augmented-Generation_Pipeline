{"summary": "globally, the proportion of DALYs for communicable diseases also decreased from 1990 (46.9%) to 2010 (33.5%). experts have predicted that the DALYs of communicable disease will decrease globally to 20% in 2030. in 2012, an estimated 10,672,000 people visited the hospital due to communicable diseases. some communicable diseases influence the incidence of non-communicable diseases. prevalence of hepatitis B, a risk factor for liver cancer, was 3.2%. in individuals over 30 years old the prevalence was 4.0%. each communicable disease was defined using the Korea burden of disease classification based on the 2010 GBD study. the DALY was the sum of YLL and YLD; the method used for this calculation is defined elsewhere (13,14). ethics statement This study was approved by the local institutional review board of Korea University (IRB No. 1040548-KU-IRB-13-164-A-1) informed consent was exempted by the board. RESULTS The total DALYs of communicable diseases were 445 per 100,000 in 2012. the 40-49 years old age group had the highest number of DALYs. 80 years old age group had the lowest number of DALYs per 100,000. 80 years old age group had the highest proportion of DALYs per 100,000. in 2012, lower respiratory infections were responsible for the highest proportion of DALYs at 143 DALYs per 100,000, followed by tuberculosis at 121 DALYs per 100,000. the top five communicable diseases accounted for approximately 86% of the total DALYs. lower respiratory infections were responsible for the highest proportion of DALYs in men. lower respiratory infections, upper respiratory infections, hepatitis, and otitis media were responsible for the highest proportion of DALYs. the disease with the highest YLLs was tuberculosis at 43 per 100,000, followed by lower respiratory infections, HIV/AIDS, diarrheal disease and meningitis. on the other hand, the disease with the highest YLDs was lower respiratory infections at 104 per 100,000 followed by tuberculosis, upper respiratory infections, hepatitis, and otitis media. the total DALYs from communicable diseases were 445 per 100,000 in 2012. the largest volume of total DALYs was in the 40-49 years old age group. 80 years old age group had highest DALYs per 100,000, followed by 70-79 and 0-9 years old age groups. in 2012, lower respiratory infections were responsible for the highest communicable disease DALY at 143 DALYs per 100,000 followed by tuberculosis. in 2012, lower respiratory infections were responsible for the highest communicable disease DALY at 143 DALYs per 100,000. DALYs for tuberculosis in men were 1.6 times higher than that seen in women. upper respiratory infections had the highest total prevalence for all-cause disease in 2012, followed by lower respiratory infections, low back pain, and diabetes mellitus. 69.1% of the total DALYs were in the 20-49 years old age groups. the highest DALYs per 100,000 in men were seen in the 40-49 years old age group at 85 DALYs per 100,000. in women, the 70-79 years old age group was the highest at 25 DALYs per 100,000. study estimated the DALYs of communicable disease for the first time in Korea. findings should be used to set priorities for evidence-informed policy making. emerging infectious diseases are recognized as a growing threat for public health in Korea."}
