{"summary": "Coronaviruses (CoV) such as 229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1 have been shown to cause mild acute respiratory disease in humans [1]\u2013[5]. intranasal infection with the group 2 CoV mouse hepatitis virus type 1 (MHV-1) results in a pulmonary infection in mice [14]. both CD4 and CD8 T cells contribute to the MHV-1-induced disease. mice were infected intranasally (i.n.) with 5103 plaque forming units (PFU) of MHV-1. each mouse was monitored daily for weight loss and severity of illness. cco's phosphate buffered saline (PBS; Gibco, Grand Island, NY) cell isolation from tissue Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells were harvested by inserting a cannula into the trachea and performing 3 consecutive 1 ml washes with RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 U/ml penicillin G, 10 g/ml streptomycin sulfate, 2 mM l immunoophenotying Single-cell suspensions of the various tissues were plated into 96-well round bottom plates at 1.5106 to 2106 cells/well. cells were washed with staining buffer (PBS containing, 2% FCS and 0.02% sodium azide) and stained with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies. MHV-1-specific CD8 T cell responses were assessed following stimulation with 1 M of the N421\u2013428 peptide. cell responses were assessed following stimulation with either Thy1.2 FITC and CD8 PerCP-Cy5.5 or Thy1.2 and CD4 for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. mice were infected intranasally (i.n.) with 5103 plaque forming units of MHV-1 in a total volume of 50 l while under light anesthesia with isoflurane. each mouse was monitored daily for weight loss and severity of illness. cannula performed 3 consecutive 1 ml washes with RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 U/ml penicillin G, 10 g/ml streptomycin sulfate, 2 mM l-glutamine, 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 10 mM HEPES (all from Gibco), all from. the tissue was dissected and cut into small pieces and placed in d with staining buffer (PBS containing, 2% FCS and 0.02% sodium azide), stained with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies. cells were washed with staining buffer and surface stained with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies. cells were washed twice with staining buffer and lysed with BD Bioscience. cells were stained with permeabilization buffer and stained with mAb. in some cases cells were stained with Foxp3 using the Foxp3 Staining Kit. the total number of AM in the lung at 48 hr was significantly reduced. C3H/HeJ mice were administered 75 l of either CL or PBS i.n. and lung mononuclear cells were isolated 48 hr later. AM depletion reduces MHV-1-induced morbidity and mortality. Mice were treated with either 75 l of CL or PBS 6 hr prior to MHV-1 infection. surviving mice were treated with either 75 l of CL or PBS 6 hr. at day 6 p.i., there was no significant difference between the CL-treated mice and the PBS control mice in total CD4 T cell numbers in the BAL. however, we observed a significant (p0.01) increase in the total number of CD4 T cells in either the BAL or lungs of CL-treated mice. Combined data from five individual experiments in (A) and (B) with n = 20 mice/group. we have previously identified six MHV-1-derived CD4 T cell epitopes in C3H mice [21] because the frequency of the responding CD4 T cells to any one of these epitopes is relatively low. mice were administered 75 l of either CL or PBS, 6 hr prior to MHV-1 infection. BAL cells from the lung airways and mononuclear cells from the lung tissue were isolated at day 6 p.i.. the ratio of Foxp3+ CD4 T cells to Foxp3 CD4 T cells was significantly increased in the BAL (p0.01) and the lungs (p0.05) of the CL-treated mice at day 6 p.i. compared to that of the PBS control mice. depletion of AM was associated with a significant increase in the number of Tregs in the lung following MHV-1 infection. the total number of AM in the lung at 48 hr was significantly (p0.05) reduced as compared to PBS controls. other pulmonary cell populations were unaffected at all time points examined. AM depletion reduces MHV-1-induced morbidity and mortality. Mice were treated with either 75 l of CL or PBS 6 hr prior to MHV-1 infection. weight was monitored over the course of infection. the mean SEM for each group is indicated by a short horizontal line. the limit of detection (LOD) is indicated on each graph by a long horizontal line. both CD4 and CD8 T cells contribute to MHV-1-induced morbidity and mortality. m196\u2013210, N346\u2013360, N376\u2013390, S171\u2013185, S881\u2013895 and S921\u2013935. we used a pool of all six epitopes to stimulate the CD4 T cells ex vivo. the frequency of the responding CD4 T cells to any one epitope is relatively low. we observed no difference in the total number of CD8lo/CD11ahi CD8 T cells in the lungs of CL-treated mice compared to the PBS control mice. the total number of CD4 and CD8 T cells in the lungs of CL-treated mice is increased, but there was not a similar increase in. we questioned if an increase in Foxp3+ Tregs would account for this apparent discrepancy. we observed significant increases in the frequency and total number of Foxp3+ CD4 T cells in the BAL (p0.01) and the lungs (p0.05) of the CL-treated mice at day 6 p.i. our results indicate that MHV-1-induced morbidity and mortality is reduced in mice administered CL prior to infection as compared to PBS control mice. this may explain why we observe a significant reduction in peak viral titers in CL-treated mice as compared to PBS controls. CL was administered 3 days prior to an acute respiratory syncytial virus infection. no significant changes in either CD4 or CD8 T cell recruitment or T cell activation. morbidity and mortality of these mice were also unaffected. the frequency of Tregs in the lung has been reported to be increased following an infection with either RSV [33] or IAV [34]. we observed a significant increase in the total number and frequency of Tregs following MHV-1 infection in both the airways and lung tissue of the CL-treated mice."}
