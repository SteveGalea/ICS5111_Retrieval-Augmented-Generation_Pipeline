{"summary": "the viral taxonomic order Nidovirales is a genetically diverse group of enveloped positive-sense RNA viruses consisting of the families Arteriviridae, Roniviridae, Coronaviridae, and the recently established Mesoniviridae. the latter currently has one member species which was first described in 2009. mesoniviruses replicate in Aedes albopictus (C6/36) insect cells and induce varying degrees of cytopathic effect (CPE) depending on the virus [2], [6], [7] there is a large variation in the reported particle size of 60\u201380 [3], 80 [5], [7] or 120 nm [2], [6] and in the appearance of the surface projections. mesonivirus was isolated from mosquitoes trapped at casuarina in the northern Territory, Australia in 2010. the virus is sufficiently different to justify its classification as a new species of mesonivirus. cell culture and Virus Isolation Aedes albopictus C6/36 cells (ATCC CRL-1660) were cultured in MEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and incubated at 25\u00b0C for 7 days. initial virus isolation was performed from mosquito homogenate that was inoculated onto monolayers of the C6/36 cells. the virus/PEG solution was pelleted at 12,000 rpm (JA16.250 rotor Beckman), for 1 h at 4\u00b0C, prior to ultracentrifugation through a 20% sucrose cushion at 28,000 rpm. the pellet was layered onto a 10\u201340% potassium tartrate/glycerol gradient and centrifuged at 50,000 rpm (SW60Ti rotor, Beckman) for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. using a Tecnai F30 FEG-TEM (FEI) operating at 300 kV with a 4 k lens-coupled camera (Direct Electron) Tilt series data were collected over a range of 60\u00b0 at 1.5\u00b0 increments along two orthogonal axes and recombined computationally to produce a 3D tomogram using the etomo software package. virions were treated with the non-ionic detergent NP-40 (Sigma cells were grown in leibovitz\u2019s L-15 medium supplemented with 10% tryptose phosphate broth and 15% FBS. all vertebrate cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. monolayers of each cell line were inoculated with either CASV or with west Nile virus. RT-PCR was performed using the NidoF1(5\u2032-GTTGTATGCTATGCCGYCG-3\u2032) or FU2/cFD3 [15] primer sets, respectively, and the Superscript III One-step RT-PCR system with Platinum Taq DNA polymerase. cycling conditions for the FU2/cFD3 primer pair were identical apart for the following conditions for the 40 cycles of PCR amplification. monolayers of C6/36 and Vero cells grown on glass coverslips were inoculated with CASV, WNV or mock-infected. after 48 hrs, the cells were fixed in acetone and probed with a cocktail of two monoclonal antibodies that are specific for double-stranded RNA. amplification of viral nucleic acids was a modification of a previously described method [18]. the product of this reaction (2 l) was a template for amplification in a mix with a primer containing only the arbitrary sequence (Primer C 5\u2032-GAGAAACCACCACCAGANNNNNN-3\u2032) the product of this reaction (2 l) was a template for amplification in a mix with a primer containing only the arbitrary sequence (Primer C 5\u2032-GAGAAACCACCACCAGANNNNNN-3\u2032) template preparation and enrichment was performed using an Ion OneTouch Template 200 Kit on a OneTouch 2 and OneTouch ES (Life Technologies, NY, USA) five or six samples were pooled on a single chip, generally yielding >450,000 reads per sample. the mosquitoes were trapped by e.V.S. dry ice baited light traps. all of the mosquitoes were female. a passage 2 stock of CASV was inoculated onto C6/36 cells. the culture supernatant harvested 4 days post-infection by centrifugation. the virus/PEG solution was pelleted at 12,000 rpm (JA16.250 rotor Beckman), for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. two dimensional images were collected using a Tecnai T12 120 keV TEM. images were taken at 67000 magnification and binned by 2 for a final pixel size of 3.4. 2D Image analysis was performed using the IMOD software package. the protein bands were visualized on the Typhoon phosphoimager (GE Healthcare) the vertebrate cells, African Green Monkey Kidney (Vero; ATCC CCL-81), baby hamster kidney (BHK; ATCC CCL-10), human adeno carcinoma (SW-13 ATCC CCL-105) and chicken embryo fibroblast (DF-1; ATCC CRL-12203) were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) containing 2\u2013 culture supernatant harvested at each passage was stored immediately at 80\u00b0C. RNA extraction was achieved with the Nucleospin RNA virus kit (Machery-Nagel) the limit of detection of the assay was determined to be 102 TCID50 equivalents/mL using RNA extracted from 10-fold serial dilutions of a titred stock of CASV. the infectious titres of CASV and WNV in passage 1 C6/36 and Chao Ball cell culture supernatants were determined by TCID50 assays. Virus particles were sedimented using ultra-centrifugation (100,000 g; SwTi55 rotor; 2 h; 4\u00b0C) and resuspended in sterile PBS overnight on ice. RNA (5 l of extract) was used as template in reverse transcription using a primer containing only the arbitrary sequence (C-6N 5\u2032-GAGAAACCACCACCAGANNNNNN-3\u2032) samples were pooled in equimolar ratios to a concentration of 9 pM in low TE buffer. a virus consensus sequence was assembled from the data using GeneiousPro v5.6 software and CavV (NCBI accession number NC_015668.1) 94 pools of mosquitoes consisted of mosquitoes from five different genera. only one homogenate of pooled coquillettidia xanthogaster female mosquitoes (n = 43) caused severe destruction of the cell monolayer when inoculated onto C6/36 cells. particles carried large club-shaped surface projections similar to those described for CavV, Ns\u00e9 virus (Ns\u00e9V), Hana virus (HanaV) and M\u00e9noV [6], [6]. each virion displayed a smooth envelope containing a double density associated with the lipid bilayer which can be attributed to the membrane protein and an electron-dense core. cryo-electron micrograph of purified CASV particles imbedded in vitrious ice layer within a holey carbon support. Scale bar in 100 nm (white). Representative virions shown for cryo-projection (B) and tomographic reconstruction (inverted contrast - C). some members of the order Nidovirales contain membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins that encase the viral RNA. if mesoniviruses have a core, it could be resolved by further investigations of other mesoniviruses using cryo-TEM. glycosylation of the S, S2 and M proteins was confirmed by the increased mobility of these proteins through the gel following removal of N-linked glycans using the glycosidase, PNGase F. the absence of CavV isolation from male mosquitoes has prompted speculation that mesoniviruses may be transmitted by an alternative strategy to ovitransposition. uclear staining in the CASV-inoculated C6/36 cells was consistent with the detection of dsRNA replication intermediates. there was no detectable replication of CASV in the vero cells. Inoculation of other Aedes albopictus cells such as RML12 or RNAi-competent U4.4 would be useful to clarify these observations [25]\u2013[27]. analysis of CASV predicted ORF Sequences. the other 4 replicase domains showed less than 90% amino acid identity. the other 4 replicase domains showed less than 90% amino acid identity. the evolutionary distance between CASV and other mesoniviruses was considerably different. the evolutionary distances of the concatenated replicase domains 3CLpro, RdRp, HEL, ExoN and OMT were calculated for each of the mesoniviruses. for the isolates CavV and NDiV, which constitute the species Alphamesonivirus 1, a value of 0.031 was obtained. this compares favourably with a value of 0.029 for the same regions calculated previously by Lauber et al. (2012). unrooted trees were generated by a maximum likelihood using alignments of 3CLpro, RdRp, HEL, ExoN, NMT and OMT with the homologous domains of other mesoniviruses. similar results were obtained using a neighbor joining model. a topology in which CASV was separated from its closest relative, alphamesonivirus 1, further supports its inclusion as a new species of mesonivirus. 94 pools of mosquitoes consisted of mosquitoes from five different genera [17] only one homogenate of pooled coquillettidia xanthogaster female mosquitoes (n = 43) caused severe destruction of the cell monolayer when inoculated onto C6/36 cells. virus was tentatively named Casuarina virus (CASV) after the suburb of Darwin. particles carried large club-shaped surface projections similar to those described for CavV, Ns\u00e9 virus (Ns\u00e9V), Hana virus (HanaV) and M\u00e9noV [6], [6] to visualize the protrusions more clearly. each virion displayed a smooth envelope containing a double density associated with the lipid bilayer. cryo-electron micrograph of purified CASV particles imbedded in vitrious ice layer within a holey carbon support. scale bar in 100 nm (white). Representative virions shown for cryo-projection (B) and tomographic reconstruction (inverted contrast - C) some members of the order Nidovirales, such as transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus, contain a core shell comprising membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins that encase the viral RNA. if mesoniviruses have a core has not been previously determined. glycosylation of the S, S2 and M proteins was confirmed by the increased mobility of these proteins through the gel following removal of N-linked glycans using the glycosidase, PNGase F. the absence of CavV isolation from male mosquitoes has prompted speculation that mesoniviruses may be transmitted by an alternative strategy to ovitransposition. there was no detectable replication of CASV in the vero cells. the surprising differences between the ability of CASV to replicate in two insect cell lines is consistent with observations by Kuwata et al., (2013). us cell line compared with that achieved in the C6/36 cell line were noted [5]. differences in the growth of these mesoniviruses in Culex cells might be attributable to the defective innate immune response of the latter [23], [24]. lack of this antiviral defense mechanism likely enhances the permissiveness of these cells to replication of some viruses. the other 4 replicase domains showed less than 90% amino acid identity. the other 4 replicase domains showed less than 90% amino acid identity. however, the evolutionary distance between CASV and other mesoniviruses was considerably different. the evolutionary distances of the concatenated replicase domains 3CLpro, RdRp, HEL, ExoN and OMT were calculated for each of the mesoniviruses. the evolutionary distances of the concatenated replicase domains 3CLpro, RdRp, HEL, ExoN and OMT were calculated for each of the mesoniviruses. unrooted trees were generated by a maximum likelihood using alignments of 3CLpro, RdRp, HEL, ExoN, NMT and OMT with the homologous domains of other mesoniviruses. similar results were obtained using a neighbor joining model. a topology in which CASV was separated from its closest relative, alphamesonivirus 1, further supports its inclusion as a new species of mesonivirus. 133 CASV virions were selected following cryo-electron microscopy or uranyl acetate staining. the diameter of each virion was determined and graphed."}
