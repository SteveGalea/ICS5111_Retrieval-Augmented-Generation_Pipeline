{"summary": "Restriction factors are germline-encoded proteins that function in a cell-autonomous manner to suppress virus replication. IFITMs have been reported to restrict the enveloped viruses influenza A, west Nile virus and dengue virus (family Flaviviridae), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. IFITMs localize to membranes of late endosomes and lysosomes. the human IFITM gene family comprises IFITM1, -2, -3 and -5. the human IFITM gene family comprises all of which possess antiviral activity and cluster together on chromosome 11. IFITM proteins comprise a relatively long hydrophilic N-terminal region. two hydrophobic intramembrane domains (IM1 and IM2) separated by a conserved intracellular loop (CIL) and a comparatively short hydrophilic C-terminal region. current evidence indicates that IFITMs block viral entry to the cytosol by preventing fusion between viral and host-cell membranes. this suggests a model in which IFITMs either resist the deformation of the membrane by the viral fusion machinery or hinder the lateral mobility of viral or cellular proteins within the membrane. a unifying mechanism to explain antiviral restriction by IFITM proteins remains elusive. IFITM3 orthologues were cloned from microbat and pig cells. it was not possible to assign pig and bat orthologues based on conserved synteny due to lack of a B4GALNT4 orthologue in pigs, gaps in the genome assemblies and low sequencing coverage of the bat genomes. the sequence we assigned as IFITM3 was the most frequent of several long IFITM variants (68 % of sequenced clones) the sequence was the only one encoding a double phenylalanine motif (F8/F9) conserved in the human and pig IFITM3 orthologues but absent from human IFITM2. blast searches revealed that the IFITM3 sequence from NPTr cells was identical to the Sus scrofa IFITM3 reference sequence. the closest match for the cloned microbat IFITM3 was a \u2018predicted IFITM3-like\u2019 gene from M. lucifugus. microbat and pig IFITM3 localize to transferrin- and CD63-positive endosomes. pig and microbat IFITM3 localize to transferrin- and CD63-positive endosomes. previous work has shown that tagged constructs adopt same topology as the WT protein. 49 cells expressing HA-tagged IFITM3 proteins from human, pig or microbat were fixed, permeabilized and stained for HA, CD63 (b) or LAMP1 (c) cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated transferrin before fixation and staining with FITC-conjugated anti-HA. images show representative staining patterns, and merged images are also shown. pig and microbat IFITM3 expressing HA-tagged IFITM3 from human, pig or microbat were incubated either on ice (a) or at 37 \u00b0C (b) with FITC-conjugated anti-HA and Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated transferrin. lentiviruses expressing the HA proteins from diverse influenza subtypes were used to infect pig and microbat IFITM3 cells. pig or microbat IFITM3 did not restrict viruses pseudotyped with the entry proteins of the gammaretroviruses amphotrophic murine leukemia virus or Gibbon ape leukemia virus. microbat and pig IFITM3 inhibit replication-competent influenza virus. A549 cells stably expressing human, pig or microbat IFITM3 were infected with influenza A virus. Western blotting performed to detect influenza NP, actin and HA-tagged IFITM3 or green fluorescent protein (GFP) pig, microbat or human IFITM3 block cell entry mediated by lyssavirus entry proteins. pig and microbat IFITM3 block cell entry mediated by multiple lyssavirus entry proteins (G proteins) pig IFITM3 inhibit cell entry mediated by lyssavirus G proteins. pig IFITM3 induction was assessed in response to dsRNA analogue poly(I: C). poly(I : C) addition led to a 3.5-fold increase in pig IFITM3 and a twofold increase in microbat IFITM3 mRNA levels. microbat cells were stimulated via poly(I : C) transfection. transfection of siRNA against pig IFITM3 led to a 63 % knockdown in IFITM3 mRNA (fold change of 1.4 log2), a 3.4-fold increase in virus yield and a twofold increase in the proportion of influenza NP-positive cells (Fig. 8c) relative to control siRNA-transfected cells. nPTr cells were either stimulated with poly(I : C) for 2 h before infection (m.o.i. 0.01) or cells were infected in the absence of poly(I : C) results are shown as meanssd for biological triplicates assayed in duplicate. pig and microbat IFITM3 nucleotide sequences were aligned with other IFITM proteins. pig and microbat IFITM3 nucleotide sequences were aligned with other IFITM proteins. an asterisk indicates identical amino acid residues, \u2018:\u2019 indicates residues with strongly similar properties and \u2018.\u2019 indicates residues with weakly similar properties. the arrow indicates the exon\u2013exon boundary. microbat and pig IFITM3 proteins were most divergent from human IFITM3 at their N and C termini. the proteins were most conserved in the central CD225 domain. pig and microbat IFITM3 localize to transferrin- and CD63-positive endosomes. enlargement of CD63-positive compartments was most marked in cells containing larger foci of IFITM3\u2013HA staining. microbat IFITM3\u2013HA sometimes co-localized with CD63 in \u2018hollow\u2019 ring-like structures. pig, microbat and human IFITM3 formed discrete puncta that overlapped or were closely associated with transferrin-positive endosomes. anti-HA staining showed that pig, microbat and human IFITM3 formed discrete puncta, which overlapped or were closely associated with transferrin-positive endosomes. microbat and pig IFITM3 restrict cell entry mediated by influenza HA. three independently cloned cell lines of the pig and microbat IFITM3 proteins inhibited the infectivity of all influenza HA subtypes tested. microbat and pig IFITM3 inhibit replication-competent influenza virus. untransduced cells or cells expressing either human, pig or microbat IFITM3 were infected with influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) and nucleoprotein (NP) expression was quantified using flow cytometry. expression of either pig or microbat IFITM3 led to a marked reduction in the proportion of NP-positive cells for all cell clones. pig IFITM3 clone 1 and microbat IFITM3 clone 2 were used. pig, microbat or human IFITM3 significantly reduced single-cycle growth of influenza A/WSN/33. inhibition of virus yields was more profound following a low m.o.i. infection. rabies virus strain Evelyn Rokitniki Abelseth (phylogroup 1), Mokola virus (phylogroup 2), Lagos bat virus (phylogroup 2) and west Caucasian bat virus (phylogroup 3) expression of IFITM3 from microbat, pig or human reduced infectivity mediated by all four lyssavirus entry proteins. baseline levels of IFITM3 mRNA were readily detected in both the porcine NPTr cells and in microbat lung fibroblasts. poly(I : C) addition led to a 3.5-fold increase in pig IFITM3 and a twofold increase in microbat IFITM3 mRNA levels. transfection of poly(I : C) (33 g ml1) (microbat cells only) qRT-PCR was used to quantify IFITM3 and the reference gene, GAPDH. the fold change in IFITM3 mRNA is expressed relative to mock-treated cells. change of 1.3 log2) led to a twofold increase in infectious yields (Fig. 8f) and a threefold increase in NP expression (Fig. 8g) relative to control siRNA transfection. endogenous IFITM3 in pig tracheal NPTr and microbat cells inhibits influenza NP expression. IFITM3 proteins with broad-spectrum antiviral function are conserved in swine and a member of the order Chiroptera. we assigned microbat IFITM3 using several criteria. first, it encoded a double phenylalanine motif (F8/F9) found only in other IFITM3 orthologues. pig and microbat IFITM3 localizes to the plasma membrane after live cell staining. pig and microbat IFITM3 contain 20YEML23 and 20YEVL23. expression of both microbat and human IFITM3 caused expansion of CD63-positive endosomal compartments, consistent with the documented ability of IFITM3 to induce MVB formation. in some cells, microbat IFITM3 co-stained with CD63 in ring-like structures. pig and human IFITM3 could restrict avian, swine and human influenza A subtypes. chicken IFITM3 inhibited viral pseudotypes bearing HAs from both avian and human strains. siRNA knockdown of endogenous pig and microbat IFITM3 enhanced influenza replication by a similar degree. the basis for the intimate association between bats and viruses remains enigmatic. there is a striking lack of functional data for any of these genes. we demonstrated that bats do encode functional IFITM3.
