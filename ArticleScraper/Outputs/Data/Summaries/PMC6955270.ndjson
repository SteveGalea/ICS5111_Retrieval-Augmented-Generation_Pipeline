{"summary": "in the poultry industry, infection of chicken flocks with IBV causes economic losses by reducing egg quantity and quality. animals become more susceptible to secondary bacterial infections like Escherichia coli. the spike of IBV is posttranslationally cleaved into two subunits, S1 and S2, where S2 is anchored in the virus membrane and important for membrane fusion. amino acids 19 to 272 of the spike are sufficient for binding to trachea as well as binding to alpha-2,3-linked sialic acids (15). this domain thus contains a receptor-binding domain (RBD) and can be used to study the biological implications of genetic variation in circulating IBV genotyp 88 percent of the amino acids between the sequences of the first 257 amino acids of IBV-QX and IBV-M41 are either identical or similar. in previous work, we demonstrated the M41-RBD was sufficient to bind to chicken trachea (15). each protein was assessed for binding using trachea and kidney tissue slides. ligand binding of M41-RBD is not significantly different compared to that of M41-S1 and M41-ED, suggesting no additional ligand-binding motifs are present in S1 and ED. ELISA was performed in triplicate where average and standard deviations are shown. a fraction was pretreated with peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) before loading, a fraction was pretreated with peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) to remove posttranslational glycosylation. both proteins had a backbone of around 32 kDa as expected after PNGase F treatment. IBV M41- and QX-RBD protein analysis. amino acids 19 to 272 and amino acids 19 to 275 of the QX spike. numbering starts at 1 of the mature protein sequence (signal sequence not shown) binding of QX-RBD was restricted to the parietal epithelium of Bowman\u2019s capsule in the glomerulus. no binding to the glomeruli was observed when using M41-RBD in three independent experiments using different protein batches. a solid-phase ELISA was performed, in which Neu5Ac2-3Gal1-3GlcNAc was coated. no binding of QX-RBD to this particular glycan was observed at any of the protein concentrations. trachea and kidney tissue slides were pretreated with arthrobacter ureafaciens neuraminidase before applying M41- and QX-RBD. chimeric proteins containing amino acids 98 to 156 (middle domain) of M41 (M-M-Q, Q-M-M, and Q-M-Q) showed reduced binding to trachea and no detectable binding to kidney tissue. chimeric RBD proteins had reduced affinity for Neu5Ac2-3Gal1-3GlcNAc. none of the proteins containing the middle QX sequence (Q-Q-M, M-Q-Q, and M-Q-M) had affinity for this glycan in the ELISA. this is in line with the hypothesis these proteins are dependent on binding to the QX receptor instead of the known M41 receptor. we exchanged two triplets of amino acids in HVR 2 (amino acids 99 to 115 of M41) that had the high diversity in amino acid characteristics. introduction of the M41 sequence in the QX-RBD protein, SGS100\u2013102Y (QX-Y) and KIP110\u2013112MLQ (QX-MLQ) and their combination (QX-Y-MLQ) resulted in a loss of binding to trachea and kidney tissues. ELISA was performed with all chimeric RBD proteins in triplicates. receptor-binding site of the QX-specific receptor differs from that proposed for M41. the overall structure of both proteins is comparable. however, the loop consisting of HVR 2 is slightly larger in QX-RBD as expected. amino acids predicted to be involved in binding to alpha-2,3-linked sialic acids (Fig. 6B, red spheres) and amino acid triplicates involved in binding to the QX-specific receptor (100 to 102 [SGS, yellow spheres] and 110 to 112 (KIP) as blue spheres. blue ribbon represents the modeled QX-RBD structure with amino acids 100 to 102 (SGS) as yellow spheres. amino acids in red spheres (S87, N144, and T162) are previously predicted to be involved in alpha-2,3-linked sialic acid binding of M41-RBD (17). s2 is in dark gray with one S1 monomer colored bright green for the RBD domain and pale green for the CTD. each protein was assessed for binding using trachea and kidney tissue slides. Binding to trachea tissue was observed using M41-ED, S1 and RBD. none of the proteins bound kidney tissue, which is shown by a representative picture using M41-RBD. M41-CTD (amino acids 254 to 513) followed by a trimerization domain (GCN4) and strep-tag (ST) at all protein amounts, a significant difference of at least P 0.01 was observed between M41-RBD, M41-ED, and M41-CTD and TCoV-S1. ELISA was performed in triplicate where average and standard deviations are shown. M41- and QX-RBD migrated at around 55 kDa (including glycosylation) and had a backbone of around 32 kDa as expected after PNGase F treatment. spectra at all temperatures followed the same curve, and both proteins had similar broad melting curves, indicating that both proteins are equally stable. QX-RBD shows a broader tissue tropism than that of M41-RBD. QX-RBD shows a broader tissue tropism than that of M41-RBD. we used M41- and QX-RBDs to study the distribution of host attachment factors across chicken tissues. we preincubated both RBD proteins with the synthetic Neu5Ac2-3Gal1-3GlcNAc before applying them to trachea and kidney tissue slides. a solid-phase ELISA was performed, in which Neu5Ac2-3Gal1-3GlcNAc was coated. trachea and kidney tissue slides were pretreated with arthrobacter ureafaciens neuraminidase before applying M41- and QX-RBD. removal of sialic acids from trachea and kidney tissue completely prevented binding of both RBD proteins. M41-RBD gains kidney binding upon MLQ107-109KIP mutation. chimeric proteins containing amino acids 98 to 156 (middle domain) of M41 (M-M-Q, Q-M-M, and Q-M-Q) showed reduced binding to trachea and no detectable binding to kidney tissue. binding of all chimeric proteins was dependent on the presence of sialic acids. receptor is determined by amino acids 99 to 159 of the spike. gray box indicates M41, and the white box indicates the QX wild-type sequence. chimeric RBDs are bound to trachea and kidney tissue. both Y99SGS and M41-KIP demonstrated decreased affinity for alpha-2,3-linked sialic acids compared to that of M41-RBD. introduction of both triplets SGS and KIP completely abolished binding to this glycan. the tyrosine (Y99) in the M41 structure (Fig. 6A, beige) occupies more space than serine (S in QX) and can be seen reaching toward a neighboring loop. the 110\u2013112KIP sequence identified in QX-RBD (Fig. 6A, dark blue) places a positive charge at the protein surface. blue ribbon represents the modeled QX-RBD structure with amino acids 100 to 102 (SGS) as yellow spheres and 110 to 112 (MLQ) as blue spheres. blue ribbon represents the M41-RBD with amino acids 100 to 102 (SGS) as yellow spheres and light blue represents 107 to 109 (MLQ) as blue spheres. IBV-QX recognizes a sialylated glycan receptor present on chicken tissues that differ from that recognized by M41. nephropathogenic IBV-QX shows expanded binding tropism based on interactions with sialic acid(s) on chicken tissues that differ from that recognized by M41. sible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (27, 28) and beta coronaviruses human coronavirus (HCoV)-OC43 and bovine coronavirus (29) glycan arrays contain multiple linear and branched glycans capped without or with alpha-2,3-linked sialic acids. the exact nature of the receptor recognized by IBV-QX could be a more complex glycan amino acid triplicate (100 to 102 in QX-RBD) varies in nephropathogenic IBV genotypes from SGS/SGT for clade GI-19 (IBV-QX), NQQ/SQQ for clade GI-13 (IBV-793B) and SGA for clade GI-14 (IBV-B1648). amino acid triplet 110 to 112 KIP is not conserved across IBV genotypes. ligand was supported by experimental evidence using the chimeric M41-RBD protein where this glycosylation site was replaced, resulting in loss of binding to trachea tissue. the cryo-EM structure of the M41-CTD predicts other putative receptor-binding loops in M41 spike (20) in contrast, we demonstrated that no binding to trachea and kidney tissue was observed using our recombinantly expressed M41-CTD. the codon-optimized sequence of QX-RBD (amino acids 19 to 275; GenBank accession number AY851295) was obtained from GenScript and cloned into the pCD5 expression vector. sequences were verified by automated nucleotide sequencing (Macrogen, The Netherlands) before cloning each fragment into the expression vector. acaccagrtckccgttcag M41-RBD ctgaacggmgayctggtgt ctgctttgctagca tagcaatgwgtsacgtsacwcattgctaattaa gtcgcttgctagca ctgcttgctagca acaccagrtckccgttcag Q gwgtsacgaacactg M41-RBD cagtgttcgcttcgctttaattaa gtcgcttcgcttcgctttaattaa gtcgcttcgcttcgctagca ctgcttccgctttaattaa M41-SGS M41-RBD atctgatggatg 93T cells were transfected with pCD5 expression vectors using polyethylenimine (PEI) at a 1:12 (wt/wt) ratio. the recombinant proteins were purified using Strep-Tactin Sepharose beads as previously described.
