{"summary": "the world health organization (WHO) declared Zika virus a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on february 1, 2016, making it only the fourth time in history for such a declaration. it implies a situation that is \u2013 Serious, unusual or unexpected, Carries implications for public health beyond the affected state\u2019s national border, and May require immediate international action. the first recognized outbreak occurred on Yap Island in the Federated States of Micronesia in 2007. an estimated 73% of the population greater than three years of age was infected and 80% of infections were subclinical. a larger outbreak then occurred in French Polynesia in 2013\u20132014 affecting 66% of the population. the identify-isolate-inform (3I) tool was developed for ebola virus disease8,9 and modified for measles10 and measles10 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) 11 for use in the detection and management of potential Zika virus patients presenting to the ED. the incidence of GBS or microcephaly appears to be similar between symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. transmission Zika virus is transmitted by the bite of the mosquito and likely also Aedes albopictus. a negative Zika IgM or RT-PCR test result does not rule out Zika virus infection. chikungunya, dengue viruses, malaria, leptospirosis, and rickettsial infections are among the other infections that should be considered. infected men should take measures to avoid sexual transmission of virus to their partners by abstaining, using condoms, and refrain from anal intercourse and fellatio. only male to female sexual transmission has been reported as of early 2016. the first step in using the Zika 3I tool is to identify patients with a possible Zika exposure within 14 days of symptom onset. this involves taking a travel history and assessing whether the patient was bitten by mosquitoes or has had sex with a patient with Zika virus within two weeks. each patient presenting to the ED should be assessed for the potential to transmit disease. patients presenting in high-risk areas of the united states should be advised to use precautions such as staying indoors in an air-conditioned environment and wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants. there is a heightened concern for an increased incidence of Zika virus in the united states. CDC issued an unprecedented travel advisory for pregnant women. patients may seek information on the potential for development of microcephaly and other birth defects. patients requiring emergency blood transfusions will need to be counseled about the risks. sudden onset fever, conjunctivitis, arthralgias, and maculopapular rash are common. death from acute Zika virus infection is rare, but has been reported in a child with sickle cell disease in Colombia. incidence of GBS or microcephaly appears to be similar between symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. testing is not recommended for asymptomatic persons, with the exception of pregnant women 2 to 12 weeks after travel to areas with ongoing Zika virus transmission. in symptomatic patients, serum should be obtained for polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), IgM, and IgG if within seven days of symptom onset. the vast majority of cases (approximately 80%) are asymptomatic. most of the remainder of patients have self-limited illnesses. women who test positive for Zika virus should be offered ultrasound assessments every 3\u20134 weeks to assess for microcephaly. identifying-isolate-inform tool adapted for Zika virus. first step in using the tool is to identify patients with a possible Zika exposure within 14 days of symptom onset. each patient presenting to the ED should be assessed for the potential to transmit disease. the second \"I\" in the 3I tool can be considered to be \u201cinvestigate\u201d rather than \u201cisolate\u201d if diseases that are contagious from person-to-person are not being considered. patients presenting in high-risk areas of the united states should be advised to use precautions such as staying indoors in an air-conditioned environment. CDC issued an unprecedented travel advisory for pregnant women22. patients may seek information on potential for development of microcephaly and other birth defects and the possibility of sexual transmission of Zika virus. there is the potential for shortages due to a decrease in eligible donors. the identify-isolate-inform tool is an instrument that can be used real-time on the front lines to rapidly detect and manage patients at risk for Zika virus presenting to the ED. the tool will assist emergency physicians in performing rapid and appropriate screening and management and counseling."}
