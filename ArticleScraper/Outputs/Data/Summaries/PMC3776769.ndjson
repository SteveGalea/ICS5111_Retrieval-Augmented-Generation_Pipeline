{"summary": "interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) protein family is a part of the dispanin family. it is composed of double-transmembrane -helices connected by a cytoplasmic (CP) loop and extracellular (EC) amino- and carboxyl-terminal polypeptide sequences. the IFITM proteins are evolutionarily conserved in vertebrates. IFITM3 is a post-translational modification on proteins by acyltransferases and acylprotein thioesterases. the modification is reversibly catalyzed by protein acyltransferases and acylprotein thioesterases. murine IFITM1 has four cysteine residues (Cys49, Cys50, Cys83, and Cys103) for the S-palmitoylation, which is required for the antiviral activity. the other IFITM family members also possess these cysteines (Figure 1-A) new studies have confirmed the expression of IFITM5 in mice, rats, humans and tammar wallabies. ifitm5-gene knockout mice have smaller bones [19]. overexpression of the gene in UMR106 cells has been shown to increase calcium uptake. to identify the S-palmitoylation site in IFITM5, we prepared cysteine-substituted mutants, IFITM5-C86A, -C52A/C53A, and -C52A/53A/86A (Cys-less) the chemical reporter assay suggested at least two out of three cysteines in IFITM5 are S-palmitoylated. the genes of IFITM5 mutants were prepared using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. the plasmid vectors of FLAG-fused IFITM5-WT, -C52A/53A, and Cys-less were constructed by inserting the cloned genes into the pBApo-CMV Neo expression vector. the forward primer 5\u2019-GGAATTCCATATGGACACTTCCCCGTG-3\u2019 and the the procedures for cell culture, transfection, and metabolic labeling were the same as reported previously. the procedures for cell culture, transfection, and protein expression were the same as reported previously. yl--D-maltopyranoside (DDM) in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 0.3 M NaCl and 5 mM imidazole. the resin was applied to a chromatography column and washed with 50 mM imidazole. the resin was applied to a chromatography column and washed with 50 mM imidazole. IFITM5 polyclonal antibody was prepared from the amino-terminal peptide sequence (TSYPREDPRAPSSRC) and anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) were used as secondary antibodies for the anti-IFITM5 and anti-FLAG primary antibodies. the proteins were detected by chemiluminescent reaction. plasmid vectors of wild-type IFITM5 (IFITM5-WT) and FLAG-fused FKBP11 (FKBP11-FLAG) were constructed by inserting the cloned genes into a pBApo-CMV Neo expression vector. the plasmid vector of IFITM5-WT was constructed by inserting the cloned gene into a pET22b expression vector. the forward primer 5\u2019-GGAATTCCATATGGACACTTCCCCGTG-3\u2019 and the reverse primer 5\u2019-CCGCTCGAGGTTATAGTCCCTCTCATCAAACTTGG-3\u2019 were used to amplify the gene encoding the entire IFITM5 from the plasmid vector for mamm acid (17-ODYA; Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in 99.5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Wako) and added to differentiation medium at concentrations of 100 M and 50 M in less than 0.1% DMSO respectively. wild-type and mutant IFITM5 proteins were also produced using an expression plasmid. total proteins were extracted from osteoblast cells which co-expressed IFITM5 and FKBP11-FLAG using a total protein extraction kit. to recover FKBP11-FLAG, 500 ng/L 3 FLAG peptide was added to the collected gel at 4\u00b0C for 1 h. the 17-ODYA-labeled proteins were chemically labeled with azide-PEG3-5(6)-carboxytetramethylrhodamine. the proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were visualized using a 532-nm laser for excitation. the fluorescence by TAMRA (565 nm) was detected using a 575-nm long-path filter. IFITM5-WT exhibited a single band near the 17.4 kDa molecular-mass marker in the absence of 2BP. however, in the presence of 2BP, the band appeared at the same position as in the presence of 2BP. the post-translational modification does not occur. the palmitoylation was also reported to induce a change in mobility on electrophoresis, just as in our present results. the western blot for the IFITM5-WT expressed in the osteoblast cells in the presence and the absence of 2BP (lanes 1 and 4), and IFITM5-WT expressed in the E. coli cells (lane 3). 17-ODYA-TAMRA-labeled plasmid encoding IFITM5-WT was cultured in the presence of 17-ODYA to label the protein metabolically. the labeled IFITM5-WT was ligated with TAMRA-azide according to the Cu(I)-catalyzed [3+2] azide-alkyne cycloaddition method. all cysteines are highly conserved among the mammalian IFITM family proteins. we prepared cysteine-substituted mutants, IFITM5-C52A/C53A, -C86A, and -C52A/C53A/C86A (Cys-less) the osteoblast cells harboring each plasmid were cultured in the absence of 2BP. the TM1-palmitoylated and TM1-depalmitoylated forms are partially palmitoylated. a total of 23 IFITM2, 23 IFITM3, and 17 IFITM5 sequences derived from mammalian species were used for the calculation of probability. the interaction between IFITM5 and FKBP11 is important for the immune activity. formation of the IFITM5-FKBP11-CD81-FPRP complex induces the expression of interferon-induced genes. if IFITM5 interacted with FKBP11, it was expected that IFITM5 would be obtained during this step and detected by immunoblotting. a single band corresponding to the S-palmitoylated IFITM5 appeared in the absence of 2BP. however, in the presence of 2BP, no band corresponding to IFITM5 appeared. these results suggest that the S-palmitoylation on IFITM5 contributes to the interaction with FKBP11. the control experiment of Figure 4-B used to verify that IFITM5 and FKBP11 were both present in the cell lysate before the immunoprecipitation. the experimental was repeated 2 times. IFITM5-WT and -C86A mutants is S-palmitoylated, whereas these residues are not S-palmitoylated in the C52A/C53A and Cys-less mutants. the results of Figure 4-B suggest that the mutants which lost the S-palmitoylation site(s), Cys52 and/or Cys53, are not able to interact with FKBP11. the halftime for the maximum mineralization in the presence of 2BP was estimated to be 7 days earlier than that in the absence of 2BP. the stained nodules were diffused in the presence of 2BP (panel b), whereas in the absence of 2BP the nodules formed a large cluster (panels a and c). this suggests that the S-palmitoylation affects the bone nodule formation in the osteoblast cells. total protein was extracted for use in the SDS-PAGE and western blot analyses. in the osteoblast cells, IFITM5-WT exhibited a single band near the 17.4 kDa molecular-mass marker in the absence of 2BP. however, in the presence of 2BP, the band appeared at a lower position than that in the absence of 2BP. the lane 4 is repeated from the lane 2 of Figure 4-A. the same sample used in lane 1 was treated with 2.5% (w/v) neutral hydroxylamine (NH2OH) and applied in lane 2. in-gel fluorescence image showed that IFITM5 was S-palmitoylated in the osteoblast cells. the FLAG-tag attached to IFITM5 has no influence on the modification and chemical labeling (lanes 1 and 5). in the C52A/C53A and Cys-less mutants, the low molecular-mass form was detected. this result indicates either Cys52 or Cys53 is involved in the S-palmitoylation. this results suggest that the rest of the cysteine in the C52A/C53A mutant, Cys86, is S-palmitoylated and the Cys-less mutant completely lost the S-palmitoylation. a total of 23 IFITM2, 23 IFITM3, and 17 IFITM5 sequences derived from mammalian species were used. a total of 23 IFITM2, 23 IFITM3, and 17 IFITM5 sequences derived from mammalian species were used. the osteoblast cells co-transfected by the plasmids encoding IFITM5-WT and FKBP11-FLAG were cultured in the absence and the presence of 2BP. the extracted cell-lysate was incubated with anti-FLAG agarose gel. the gel was washed several times and the proteins were competitively eluted by FLAG peptide. Western blot for detecting the interaction of IFITM5 with FKBP11. the anti-FLAG and the anti-IFITM5 antibodies were used as primary antibodies. Arrows indicate the existence of each protein and the S-palmitoylation on IFITM5. fected by the plasmids encoding IFITM5 mutants (C52A/C53A, C86A, and Cys-less) and FKBP11-FLAG were cultured. the immunoprecipitation assay was carried out in the same way as described above. mitoylation site(s) Cys52 and/or Cys53 are not able to interact with FKBP11. previous studies have revealed that IFITM5 also contributes to bone formation [18-21]. mitoylation affects bone nodule formation in osteoblast cells in presence and absence of 2BP. time-dependent bone nodule formation in the osteoblast cells in the presence and absence of 2BP. die in the CP loop (Cys86) are S-palmitoylated. all the cysteines in IFITM5 may be involved in the S-palmitoylation. the dissociation of CD9 from the FKBP11-CD81-FPRP/CD9 complex is induced by formation of the IFITM5-FKBP11-CD81-FPRP complex. it is unknown which states as described in (i)-(iii) are important for the bone formation at present. no interactive protein has been identified in IFITM3 and IFITM2. investigations also revealed that IFITM5 expressed in the heterologous fibroblast NIH3T3 cells exhibited direct interactions with CD81, the B cell receptor-associated protein 31 (BCAP31) and the hydroxysteroid (17-beta) dehydrogenase 7 (HSD17b7) these three proteins bind to the IFITM5 without the S-palmitoylation. these interactions are not observed in the native osteoblast cells. ylation-mediated specific interaction of IFITM5 with FKBP11 was lost. CD9 would remain associated with the FKBP11-CD81-FPRP/CD9 complex. it was suggested that the interaction of the S-palmitoylated IFITM5 with FKBP11 regulates the immune activity in the osteoblast cells. ines are all S-palmitoylated (ii) the S-palmitoylation leads to the clustering and the correct positioning of IFITM3 molecules in the membrane (iii) the S-palmitoylation leads to the correct positioning of IFITM3 molecules in the membrane (iii) IFITM5 forms the IFITM5-FKBP11-CD81-FPRP complex. it is unknown at present which of the three states (i)(iii) is important for the bone mineralization of the osteoblast cells. lack of the S-palmitoylation influences the interaction with FKBP11. in IFITM3, two cysteines in the TM1 domain (Cys71 and Cys72 for IFITM3, Cys70 and Cys71 for IFITM2) and one cysteine in the CP loop (Cys105 for IFITM3, Cys104 for IFITM2) are all S-palmitoylated in cells. the roles of the S-palmitoylation on IFITM5 have been studied intensively. IFITM3 is S-palmitoylated at Cys71, Cys72, and Cys105. the functional mechanism of IFITM5 is summarized by combining the results from the present and previous studies. the S-palmitoylation on IFITM5 in the TM1 domain is necessary for the interaction. we speculate that Cys86 is involved in the S-palmitoylation but does not contribute to the interaction with FKBP11. previous investigations also revealed that IFITM5 expressed in the heterologous fibroblast NIH3T3 cells exhibited direct interactions with CD81. CD81, also known as TAPA-1, is a member of the tetraspanin membrane protein family. it dissociates from the FKBP11-CD81-FPRP/CD9 complex. if the S-palmitoylation-mediated specific interaction of IFITM5 with FKBP11 were lost, the IFITM5-FKBP11-CD81- FPRP complex would not be formed. possible mechanism of the interaction of IFITM5 with FKBP11 and role of IFITM5 in the osteoblast cell function by means of a comparison with IFITM3. the three cysteines are all S-palmitoylated (ii) the S-palmitoylation leads to the correct positioning of IFITM3 molecules in the membrane (iii) the loss of the interaction between IFITM5 and FKBP11 could be due to a relocalization of the depalmitoylated IFITM5 that prevents its association with FKBP11. the lack of the S-palmitoylation influences the interaction with FKBP11, which could account for the following complex formation and gene expression. the palmitoylation and depalmitoylation cycle is constitutive and regulated by enzymes. based on the present results, it is difficult to address whether the S-palmitoylation on IFITM5 is constitutive or regulated."}
