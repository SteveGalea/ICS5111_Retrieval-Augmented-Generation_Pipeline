IFNLs are induced upon sensing of virus infection in particular after lung and liver infection. cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus can induce IFNLs. the most prominent producers are myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cells. a secreted form lacking exon VI has been described and may function as a decoy receptor dampening IFNL responses. the IFNL ligand-receptor interface is comprised of helix A, loop AB, and helix F for IFNL and the N-terminal domain. mutations in the IFNL3 and IFNL1 receptor binding sites have been described. initial binding of IFNLs to IFNLR1 induces the recruitment of IL-10RB. cross-tyrosine phosphorylation of the IFNLR recruits signal transducer and activator of transcriptions (STAT) 1 and 2 to the receptor platform. IFNL induces a slower and more sustained ISG response. IFNL4 induces expression of rantes and fos genes in hepatoma cells. both proteins interfere with STAT signaling and therefore lead to desensitization to type I IFNs and IFNLs [59\u201361] IFNLs are themselves ISGs as IFN stimulation of hepatoma cells induces their expression. IFNL1 through IFNL3 have a high degree of sequence similarity. IFNL1\u20133 proteins are roughly 22 kDa in size, while IFNL4 is slightly smaller with 20 kDa. significant differences occur in the side chains of IFNL1, IFNL2 and IFNL3. IFNL expression is tightly controlled and expression profiles of IFNL subtypes are ligand and tissue specific [8]. most prominent producers of these antiviral cytokines are myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cells. IFNL expression onset and duration differ for the four subtypes. primary human hepatocytes (PHH) carrying the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) responsible for IFNL4 expression show an early and short IFNL4 expression. IFNL3 was detectable from 2 to 24 h after stimulation with a synthetic poly I:C RNA ligand. hepatocytes, hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines respond to IFNL. a secreted form lacking exon VI has been described. the IFNL ligand-receptor interface is comprised of helix A, loop AB, and helix F for IFNL. IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 translocates to the nucleus where it binds to the IFN regulated response element (ISRE) to drive ISG-stimulated gene expression. differences in receptor tissue expression and the kinetics of STAT pathway induction exist between the two IFN classes. IFNL induces a slower and more sustained ISG response. IFNL4 displays antiviral activities comparable to IFNL3 in hepatocytes. hepatitis C virus belongs to the genus Hepacivirus in the Flaviviridae family. 92\u2013149 million people, representing approximately 2% of the world's population, are chronically infected with HCV [66], one of the causative agents of viral hepatitis. people who inject drugs have the highest risk of contracting hepatitis C. injecting drug users are positive for HCV-antibodies. in both cases, HCV targets the liver, in particular hepatocytes. the narrow host range is determined by the presence or absence of host cell factors. direct acting antivirals (DAAs) are more effective than PEG-IFN-alpha in eliminating HCV, but also treatment duration is shorter (minimum of 8 weeks), they can be administered orally. despite advances in drug development, a vaccine against HCV is still not available. gene I (RIG-I) [73] and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) [74, 75] both belong to the family of RIG-I like receptors. oligomerization of adaptor protein mitochondria antiviral signal (MAVS) into large signaling complexes. extracellular dsRNA, maybe released from dying cells, can be taken up into uninfected neighboring cells by class A scavenger receptors. hepatitis C virus belongs to the genus Hepacivirus in the Flaviviridae family. hepatitis C virus is an enveloped virus with a single-stranded, positive-orientated RNA genome of 9.6 kbp length. this is partially due to viral mechanisms counteracting the immune response. replication and virus assembly occurs in endoplasmic reticulum- (ER-) associated membranous structures. HCV assembly, maturation, budding, and release occur in close contact with the cellular very low density lipoprotein synthesis pathway. people who inject drugs have the highest risk of contracting hepatitis C. over 60% of injecting drug users are positive for HCV-antibodies. in both cases, HCV targets the liver, in particular hepatocytes. direct acting antivirals (DAAs) are more effective than PEG-IFN-alpha in eliminating HCV, but also treatment duration is shorter (minimum of 8 weeks), they can be administered orally, and adverse events are less. despite advances in drug development, a vaccine against HCV is still not available. double-stranded (ds) RNA replication intermediates are generated and recognized as PAMPs by the cytosolic RNA sensor retinoic acid-induced gene I (RIG-I) [73] and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) [74, 75], both belonging to the family of RIG-I like receptors. extracellular dsRNA, maybe released from dying cells, can be taken up into uninfected neighboring cells by class A innate immune response can only control HCV replication but not eliminate the virus. NS3/4A serine protease has been shown to inhibit IFR3 phosphorylation by cleaving and inactivating the NS3/4A adaptor protein MAVS [82\u201384] and the TLR3 adaptor protein TRIF [85]. the authors observed elevated expression of the IFNLR in liver biopsies from infected patients. a correlation between the activity of the IFNL4 protein and ISG induction has been discovered. IFNL1 mRNA and protein levels are elevated, correlating with ISG expression. hepatoma cell lines are frequently used to study different aspects of the HCV life cycle. the magnitude of induction differs from donor to donor but correlates with virus replication. hepatoma cell lines are frequently used to study different aspects of the HCV life cycle. hepatoma cell lines are used to study the effect of exogenously added IFNL on HCV infection as they express all components of the IFNLR pathway. IFNL stimulation reduces levels of subgenomic or full length genomic HCV (+)RNA in Huh-7 cells in a dose dependent-manner [49, 103, 104] IFNL gene polymorphisms are rs12979860(C/T) located 3 kb upstream of the IFNL3 gene [111, 112], rs8099917 (T/G) located between the IFNL2 and IFNL4 genes. the first allelic variant is associated with a higher probability of sustained virological response to IFN-alpha/RBV treatment. IFNL1 are located on the forward strand of the chromosome. IFNL3-4 are located on the reverse strand of the chromosome. rs12979860, rs368234815, and rs8099917 are indicated. IFNL4 expression is associated with increased ISG levels and this in turn worsens treatment outcome. this is in line with observations that patients with increased pretreatment ISG levels in the liver respond more poorly to IFN-alpha/RBV therapy. this has been confirmed in an independent study on the IFNL4 coding SNP rs117648444 [90]. s12979860 SNP in african-americans, while the predictive value of both SNPs is similar in European-Americans. the third SNP with strong predictive value (rs8099917) for the outcome of HCV infection also shows a higher frequency of the protective allele (T) in individuals of European and Asian ancestry as well as spontaneous clearance. two IFN types are their tissue specificity caused by the divergent expression pattern of their receptors. the overlapping response of IFN-alpha and IFNL signaling on the one hand made IFNL promise that the replacement of IFN-alpha by IFNL would yield the same therapy outcome with less side effects. NL3 analogs allow high yield production and are comparable to IFN-alpha2a in their ability to inhibit HCV replication in Huh-7.5.1 cells. the licensing of effective DAA paved the way for an IFN-free therapy of CHC, which is becoming the standard of care nowadays. however, we still lack specific drugs for other hepatotropic viruses. IFNL in Experimental Animal Models of Hepatitis C. there is no link between type III IFN expression in the liver or peripheral organs of infected chimpanzees and the outcome of the acute infection. current mouse models do not allow chronic HCV infection. hepatoma cell lines are frequently used to study the effect of exogenously added IFNL on HCV infection. IFNL response in hepG2-HFL cells stably replicating a HCV subgenome is blunted, probably due to MAVS cleavage by HCV NS3/4A. IFNL3 and IFNL4 induce the same set of ISGs in hepatoma cells. the majority of hepatoma cell lines do not elicit a strong immune response. the authors observed elevated expression of the IFNLR in liver biopsies. high IFNL4 and ISG levels negatively impacted the outcome of HCV infection and treatment. in livers of chimpanzees a strong host response can be detected. there is no link between type III IFN expression in the liver or peripheral organs of infected chimpanzees and the outcome of the acute infection. hepatoma cell lines are frequently used to study different aspects of the HCV life cycle. the magnitude of induction differs from donor to donor but correlates with virus replication. IFNL response in HepG2-HFL cells stably replicating a HCV subgenome is blunted. IFNL stimulation reduces levels of subgenomic or full length genomic HCV (+)RNA in Huh-7 cells in a dose dependent-manner [49, 103, 104]. these results were confirmed in several other hepatoma cell lines, including the Huh-7 derived Lunet hCD81 cells expressing a firefly luciferase gene. IFNL gene polymorphisms are located 3 kb upstream of the IFNL3 gene. the first allelic variant is associated with a higher probability of sustained virological response to IFN-alpha/RBV treatment. this work spurred further investigations on IFNL gene SNPs and their role during HCV infection and treatment. ms rs12979860, rs368234815, and rs8099917 and their corresponding nucleotide position are indicated (red) the IFNL SNPs are the strongest predictors for response known to date. six additional SNPs in the IFNL locus have been described to strongly associate with sustained virological response after IFN-alpha/RBV treatment. IFNL4 coding SNP rs117648444 results in a less active IFNL4 variant and consequently in improved treatment response. genetic markers may also allow prediction of treatment duration and consequently reduce costs and exposure time to DAAs. the rs12979860 SNP also predicts HCV clearance rates. IFNL polymorphisms are rs12979860(C/T) located 3 kb upstream of the IFNL3 gene. these polymorphisms are in high linkage disequilibrium [113, 114] for all three SNPs the first allelic variant is associated with a higher probability of sustained virological response to IFN-alpha/RBV treatment. IFNL1\u20134 (blue) are located on the forward strand of the chromosome. IFNL1\u20134 (blue) are located on the reverse strand of the chromosome. IFNL3-4 are located on the reverse strand of the chromosome. the rs8099917 SNP has been suggested to influence IFNL3 mRNA stability with the favorable allele being more stable. IFNL4 expression is associated with increased ISG levels and this in turn worsens treatment outcome. IFNL4 expression is associated with increased ISG levels and this in turn worsens treatment outcome. the rs12979860(C) variant predominating in the former population. it is a better predictor than the rs12979860(C) variant in african-americans. the predictive value of both SNPs is similar in European-Americans. ferons signal via ISGF3 in primary human hepatocytes as well as in hepatoma cell lines [49]. but the kinetics and magnitude of ISG induction differ between IFN-alpha and IFNL. the overlapping response of IFN-alpha and IFNL signaling on the one hand made IFNL promise that the replacement of IFN-alpha by IFNL would yield the same therapy outcome with less side effects. IFNL3 has the highest activity among the IFNL types and therefore might be more suitable as therapeutic agent than IFNL1 [55]. IFNL3 analogs allow high yield production and are comparable to IFN-alpha2a in their ability to inhibit HCV replication in Huh-7.5.1 cells."}
