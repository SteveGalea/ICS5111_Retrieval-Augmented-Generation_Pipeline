{"summary": "outbreaks in the u.s. and canada were suspected to be caused by consumption of PEDV-contaminated feed or feed ingredients. feed has since been confirmed as one of the many routes of PEDV-transmission, which has led to investigations into identifying ways to mitigate infectivity. chemical decontamination was performed according to procedures outlined by Huss et al. (2017). the facility was then heated to 60 \u00b0C for a minimum of 24 h. the environmental surfaces were sampled using swabs (World Bioproducts, Mundelein, IL) and verified devoid of PEDV genetic material. the virus was divided into 3, 500 mL aliquots and stored at 80 \u00b0C. the 500 mL aliquots were allowed to thaw overnight at 4 \u00b0C in the FSRC until used the following day. five kilograms of swine diet were mixed in a 0.113 m3 electric paddle mixer. the feed was mixed for 5 min before aseptically sampled. clean disposable gloves were worn while subsampled within the mixer. the PEDV inoculum premix (4.5 kg of feed + 500 mL of stock virus) was then added to 45 kg of swine diet to form the positive experimental batch. 4 subsequent 50 kg batches of PEDV-free swine diet were mixed, discharged, sampled, and handled. equipment was not cleaned between any feed batches until completion of the replicate. a 4 mL aliquot of the feed suspension was evaluated by Kansas State University (KSU) using a PEDV spiked gene-based rRT-PCR assay. twenty milliliters of aliquots for bioassay were harvested from all batch samples. the CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) the thermal cycling parameters were: 10 min reverse transcription at 48 \u00b0C, 10 min of reverse transcriptase inactivation/initial denaturation at 95 \u00b0C followed by 45 cycles of 10 s at 95 \u00b0C and 40 s at 60 \u00b0C. all animal samples and stock virus were analyzed by Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory pigs were fed liquid milk replacer (Esbilac; PetAg, IL) and pelleted diet (all natural starter 2; Heartland Co-op, Alleman, IA) the pelleted diet did not contain animal protein with the exception of dried whey. a total of 16 rooms (3 pigs per room) were assigned to batches sampled from the mixer (1 negative control room and 15 challenge rooms) each pig from the mixer negative control room was orogavaged with a 10 mL aliquot of inoculum created from the negative control feed collected from the mixer during each of replicate 1, 2, and 3, thus each negative pig represented 1 of 3 replicates. the stock solution of PEDV contained 4.5 106 50% tissue culture infectious dose/mL (TCID50/mL) the virus was divided into 3, 500 mL aliquots and stored at 80 \u00b0C. one aliquot was used in each replication. 3Each kilogram of premix contains 4,409,171 IU vitamin A, 551,146 IU vitamin D3, 17,637 IU vitamin E, 1,764 mg menadione, 3,300 mg riboflavin, 11,023 mg d-pantothenic acid, 19,841 mg niacin, 15 mg vitamin B12. mixing a 500 mL aliquot of stock virus into a 4.5 kg batch of the swine diet was established. the PEDV inoculum premix (4.5 kg of feed + 500 mL of stock virus) was then added to 45 kg of swine diet to form the positive experimental batch and was mixed, discharged, sampled, and handled as described. g sample was added to 400 mL of PBS (Life Technologies; pH, 7.4) in 500 mL bottles. contents were thoroughly mixed and allowed to settle at 4 \u00b0C overnight. a 4 mL aliquot of the feed suspension was evaluated by Kansas State University. amplification was performed on the CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) the thermal cycling parameters were: 10 min reverse transcription at 48 \u00b0C, 10 min of reverse transcriptase inactivation/initial denaturation at 95 \u00b0C followed by 45 cycles of 10 s at 95 \u00b0C and 40 s at 60 \u00b0C. a total of 66, 10-d-old pigs were purchased from a conventional breeding farm. all pigs were confirmed negative for PEDV, porcine delta coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine rotaviruses (groups A, B, and C) by virus-specific rRT-PCR on rectal swabs. all pigs were euthanized at 7 dpi for necropsy by i.v. overdose of pentobarbital sodium solution. an aliquot of fresh cecal contents for PEDV rRT-PCR was sent to the Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (Ames, IA) value of 45 was set at 45 cycles to minimize false negatives. results for treatment criteria were considered significant at P 0.05. no PEDV RNA was detected by rRT-PCR when the negative control batch was sampled. 2 Mixer 0/9 9/9 7/9 0/9 0/9 0/9 Feed, Ct3 Mixer 45.0a 31.7c 39.6b 45.0a 45.0a 45.0a Bucket elevator 45.0a 30.9c 39.4b 43.7a 45.0a 45.0a a,b,cMeans with different superscripts differ (P 0.05) all pigs from the mixer negative control batch were rRT-PCR positive on rectal swabs at 2 dpi and continued to shed virus to the end of the study. none of the pigs from mixer sequence 3 and sequence 4 shed virus on rectal swabs throughout the study. 3/9 3/9 3/9 3/9 3/9 Sequence 2 0/9 1/9 3/9 3/9 3/9 Sequence 3 0/9 0/9 0/9 0/9 0/9 0/9 0/9 0/9 0/9 0/9 0/9 0/9 0/9 0/9 0/9 0/9 0/9 0/9 0/9 2Fecal swabs and cecum contents were analyzed for presence of PEDV RNA by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction on 0, 2, 4, 6, and 7 d postinoculation (dpi) all pigs from the negative bucket elevator batch were rRT-PCR negative on rectal swabs collected before inoculation and for the duration of the study. samples (7/9) had detectible PEDV RNA and the mean Ct increased (Ct = 39.6; P 0.05) compared to the positive feed batch. the main effect of batch (P = 0.001) had an effect on feed Ct values. feed was mixed for 5 min and sampled, then discharged for 10 min into the bucket elevator and sampled upon exit. equipment was not cleaned between batches; however, was decontaminated between replicates. all pigs from the mixer positive batch were rRT-PCR positive on rectal swabs collected before inoculation and at 7 dpi. 1 pig was rRT-PCR positive on rectal swab at 2 dpi and by 4 dpi, 3 of 3 pigs from mixer sequence 4 were PEDV rRT-PCR positive on fecal swabs. none of the feed from mixer sequence 2 had detectible PEDV RNA in cecum contents at 7 dpi. 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 0/3 1Tissue culture fluid containing 4.5 106 TCID50/mL of PEDV was inoculated into 49.5 kg of PEDV-negative feed. feed was mixed for 5 min and sampled, then discharged for 10 min into the bucket elevator and sampled upon exit. rRT-PCR positive on rectal swab at 2 dpi and by 4 dpi, 3 of 3 pigs from this room had rRT-PCR positive rectal swabs and shed virus to the end of the study and in 7 dpi cecum contents. none of the pigs from bucket elevator sequence 1 shed PEDV during the study. cross-contamination occurred across batches in a feed mill by a viral pathogen. sequencing a batch of medicated-free feed appears to be similar to sequencing medicated feed. cross-contamination appears to occur at different locations during feed manufacturing. swabs collected from the plastic bucket elevator buckets and rubber belt remained rRT-PCR positive during feed sequencing. an additional source of cross-contamination is possibly from the mixer. concerns raised about how to eliminate the pathogen from contaminated feed production facilities. rRT-PCR negative samples from sequence 2 were infectious in a swine bioassay. results parallel previous studies where infected tissue homogenates titrated beyond detection limits of rRT-PCR were positive. a serial dilution of PEDV cell culture fluid titrated beyond detection limits of rRT-PCR was infective in neonatal pigs. high health herds from nucleus farms, boar studs, or breeding stock multiplication units are critical to swine production. sequencing alone may not provide enough hazard mitigation for these swine herds since the magnitude of the risk of infection increases when feeding larger populations. further research is underway investigating additional PEDV mitigation methods during feed manufacturing."}
