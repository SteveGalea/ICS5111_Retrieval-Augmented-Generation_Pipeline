{"summary": "the reliability of case definitions has rarely been investigated systematically. 7870 classifications were done by 396 LHD (93%) and all SHD. reporting sensitivity was 90.0%, positive predictive value 76.6%. the world health organization has been encouraging the use of case definitions to make surveillance data comparable between countries. one of the first case definitions used for national disease reporting was the case definition for AIDS published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 1982 [2]. in 1985 Sacks published a survey among all 50 US states, Puerto Rico, and Washington, DC, that revealed important variations in the case definitions between the different states. in 1990 the CDC published an edition of case definitions for public health surveillance Germany is a federal republic with 16 states subdivided into 440 counties. the local health departments are the primary recipients of infectious disease notifications made by physicians and laboratories. the report is being forwarded to the federal institution in charge of national infectious disease surveillance in Germany. the German case definitions are divided into three types of evidence: clinical picture, laboratory detection, and epidemiological confirmation. the types of evidence are specifically defined for each disease. in the revised 2004 edition of case definitions these five categories were named slightly differently. the reactive arthritis, which may also be caused by Salmonella infection, is not to be reported. epidemiological confirmation defined as at least one of the following constellations while taking into account the incubation period (about 6 to 72 hours) classify a selection of 68 written case examples on the basis of the case definitions that were implemented in 2001. we applied this method to assess to which extend the case definitions were unambiguous enough to assure identical classification by the health departments. clinical classification was considered correct if the part regarding the clinical picture was classified according to the gold standard. analysis was done to compare case definitions with narrative description of the clinical picture to case definitions with a more explicit check-list format of clinical criteria. case examples were created based on real cases that have come to the attention of the RKI in the quality control process and in the information service hotline. group 1 group 2 group 3 group 4 Local health departments in west german states set A set B Set C Set D Salmonellosis * Salmonellosis * Salmonellosis * Salmonellosis * Salmonellosis * Hepatitis B Measles+ Creutzfeldt-Jakob-Disease (CJD)+ Meningococcal meningitis Hepatitis C Adenovirus conjunctivitis Influenza Tuberculosis+ Polio the chance of agreement with the gold standard was only two third (OR = 0.678) for tuberculosis case examples compared to salmonella case examples. the higher the odds ratio the higher the agreement with the gold standard. three epidemiologists reassessed each individual case example and re-examined whether the classification originally intended was still justified. based on this process the gold standard was defined for each case example. health departments use one of five software products on the market to classify the case reports according to the national edition of case definitions. from there the report is being forwarded to the federal institution in charge of national infectious disease surveillance in Germany [11] the edition of national case definitions for all notifiable infectious diseases was introduced in Germany in 2001. in the revised 2004 edition of case definitions these five categories were named slightly differently. examples of the RKI-case definition for Salmonellosis in the original 2001 version and the revised 2004 version version 2001. cases are also reported from the local health department to the next level if category A is fulfilled. round-Robin tests are mainly used in proficiency tests in order to determine laboratory performance by comparing tests on identical items by two or more laboratories in accordance with predetermined conditions. reportability was considered correct if a case that should not have been reported to the next level was in fact classified in a way that the case would have been held back. however, cases forwarded with wrong disease identification were a priori considered incorrect. case examples were created based on real cases that have come to the attention of the RKI in the quality control process and in the information service hotline that the RKI is offering to the health departments. each local health department in west Germany (excluding Berlin) received four different case examples each for four different notifiable diseases resulting in 16 case examples to be classified. Salmonella case examples consisted of two case examples of salmonella enterica spp., one case example of salmonella paratyphi and one case example of enterohaemorrhagic shigellosis. c fever 0.161

control of case reports (versus this being done exclusively by public health nurses), institutional level (local health department, state health department, RKI), acceptance and style of case definitions (check-list vs. text) and software used at local health department. the clinical classification was considered correct if the part regarding the clinical picture was classified according to the gold standard. the analysis was done to compare case definitions with narrative description of the clinical picture to case definitions with a more explicit check-list format of clinical criteria. cases were pre-tested among epidemiologists within the RKI and among public health nurses in the state and local health departments. in each west german state, sets E to H were randomly distributed among local health departments. the salmonella case examples appeared in all eight sets, in order to have the possibility to compare between local health departments and other determinants based on identical case examples. the chance of agreement with the gold standard was only two third (OR = 0.678) for tuberculosis case examples compared to salmonella case examples. the higher the odds ratio the higher the agreement with the gold standard. three epidemiologists reassessed each individual case example and re-examined whether the classification originally intended was still justified. based on this process the gold standard was defined for each case example. results study population received completed forms from 396 (93%) of 425 local health departments. 30 epidemiologists from all 16 states and 18 epidemiologists within the RKI had completed the forms. in 7003 case examples the correct disease was identified. health departments in group 3 using the RKI software had a higher chance of classifying case examples (clinical classification) according to the gold standard (OR = 1.32, CI: 1.01 \u2013 1.70). east Germany versus west Germany Analysis of case examples showed that local health departments in East Germany had a lower chance of identifying the disease correctly compared to West german local health departments in group 1. local health departments in east Germany showed a lower chance to identify the disease correctly (OR = 0.82, CI: 0.68 \u2013 0.99) and of reporting correctly to the next level compared to west german local health departments (OR = 0.84, CI: 0.73 \u2013 0.96). the case examples of salmonella had higher rates of agreement with the gold standard compared to case examples of all other diseases. cases of set A and set E were 1.5 times higher in cases done by state level staff. the chance of correct reporting to the next level was 1.5 times higher in cases done by state level staff compared to those done by local health department staff. the section on the clinical picture of the case definitions was seen as unambiguous in all case definitions by 72 respondents (18%), in the majority of case definitions by 305 (76%), in the minority by 20 (5%), and in none of the case definitions by one (0.3%) of the respondents (n = 398 respondents) three-hundred and three (87%) of 347 health departments stated that case classifications were done exclusively or primarily by public health nurses. 1182 (23.4%) should have been excluded from reporting. group-wise multivariate analysis was limited to data from local health departments. only statistically significant associations are mentioned in the following. the analysis among the 1508 classified case examples showed no significant association between group and reporting, suggesting no evidence for allocation bias. for this reason separate analyses were done comparing the different diseases by using salmonella cases examples as the reference variable adjusted for East/West. data from east german health departments (n = 2019) and RKI (n = 1016) were the only participants exposed to case examples of disease nationally reportable (with narrative description of the clinical picture) and to case examples of diseases only notifiable in East German states (check-list format) agreement in case classification with the gold standard was more than three times as high when the respective case definitions had listed the clinical criteria in a check-list format. a higher chance of classifying case examples (clinical classification) according to the gold standard (OR = 1.32, CI: 1.01 \u2013 1.70) local health departments in East Germany had a lower chance of identifying the disease correctly compared to West german local health departments in group 1 (OR = 0.40, CI: 0.27 \u2013 0.58), of identifying the case definition category correctly in group 2 (OR = 0.76, CI: 0.58 \u2013 1.00) local health departments in east Germany had a lower chance to identify the disease correctly (OR = 0.74, CI: 0.62 \u2013 0.88) and of reporting correctly to the next level compared to west german local health departments (OR = 0.84, CI: 0.73 \u2013 0.96). separately analyses were done comparing the different diseases by using Salmonella cases examples as the reference variable adjusted for East/West. the concept of epidemiological confirmation was not well understood. participants appeared to have difficulties deciding whether all clinical signs and symptoms had to be existent in a case, or if they were listed as descriptive examples. 305 (76%), in the minority by 20 (5%), and in none of the case definitions by one (0.3%) of the respondents (n = 398 respondents) the section on the laboratory confirmation of the case definitions was seen as unambiguous in all case definitions by 137 respondents (34%), in the majority of case definitions by 248 (62%), and in the minority by 11 (3%) (n = 396) the complexity of the case definition itself is likely to affect reporting precision. the complex case definition system may appear very complex and less intuitive. the detailed differentiation of the German case definitions enables us to apply computer algorithms in order to translate these to the EU case definitions and thus make the data compatible to the standards of various European surveillance networks. the clinical picture was now defined in a clear check-list of signs and symptoms, instead of an unspecific mentioning of various possible signs and symptoms, such as in the first edition of the IfSG case definitions. the results of the study were integrated in a case example book, which contains each of the 68 case examples followed by the required gold standard classification. the evidence type \"epidemiological confirmation\" was completely redesigned. the accepted types of epidemiological links are now specified individually for each case definition. the case definitions are now limited to criteria relevant for the decision process. german case definition edition deducted from this analysis may also be applicable for case definitions in other countries. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors' contributions GK conceived of the study and is responsible for the design of the study."}
