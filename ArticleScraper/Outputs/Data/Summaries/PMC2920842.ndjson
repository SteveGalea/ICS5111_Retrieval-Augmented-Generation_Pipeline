{"summary": "the selection of CD8+ T cells into an immune response requires specific interaction between the TCR and virus peptide bound to pMHC-I molecules on the surface of infected host cells. the processing of virus proteins into short fragments generates thousands of peptides that might potentially form pMHC-I epitopes. however, only a few elicit CTL responses. mutations at wt CD8+ T cells lead to partial (cross-reactive) or total (non-cross-reactive) loss of recognition by wt CD8+ T cells [13], with some variants eliciting epitope-specific CD8+ CTL responses. this raises the possibility that it might be worthwhile to think in terms of vaccinating against likely virus escape mutants. the wt NP366\u2013374 peptide binds to the H-2Db in an extended conformation. the P2-Ser, P5-Asn and P9-Met are the anchor residues. the P4-Glu, P6-Met, P7-Glu and P8-Thr are solvent exposed. the splenic DbNPN3A+CD8+ set elicited by the HKNPN3A challenge was significantly smaller on d10 (p0.05) than the DbNP366 +CD8+ T cell response induced by the wt virus. there was no significant difference between DbNP3A+CD8+ and DbNP366 +CD8+ T cell numbers at the site of infection. cells were stained with the DbNP366-PE, DbNPN3A-PE or DbPA224-PE tetramers and anti-CD8-PerCPCy5.5 mAb. the numbers of epitope specific CD8+ T cells were calculated from the % cells staining and the total cell counts. HKNP366 +CD8+ and NPN3A+CD8+ T cells elicited by HKNPN3A infection bound the DbNP366 tetramer and produced IFN- ICS. both techniques gave us comparable antigen-specific CD8+ T cell numbers, indicating that both tetramers accurately detected epitope-specific populations. the NPN3A mutation was associated with a numerically diminished response following infection with either the wt or NPN3A influenza A viruses. we also asked if there was any effect on CD8+ T cell function or phenotype. more of the DbNPN3A+CD8+ T cells remained CD62Lhi when sampled at peak of the response (d10). the structure of the wt DbNP366 and wt DbNP366 and DbNPN3A complexes is very similar with a root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 0.44 on the 1\u20132 domains and a r.m.s.d of 0.20 on the peptides. the peptide is represented in stick conformation with. the p3 mutation to alanine abolishes contacts between the peptide and the MHC molecule. the mutation of P3-Asn to Ala leads to a loss of 35 contacts between the peptide and the molecule. wt NP366 that makes 636 contacts with the H-2Db molecule achieves only 601 contacts. the mutation abolishes contacts between the P3 residue of the peptide with His155 and the Tyr156 of the MHC. the loss of inter-residue bonding between 3N and 4E within the peptide may also be important for TCR recognition as it changes the characteristics of the wt DbNP366 epitope. of 51.80.7\u00b0C and DbNPN3A showed a comparable level of thermostability (Tm = 51.41\u00b0C) irrespective of the concentrations of the complex used for the assay. this suggests that the NPN3A mutation does not modify the stability of the pMHC-I complex when compared to the cognate epitope. only one (SGGANTGQL and SGGGNTGQL) or two (SGGSNTGQL) of the 10 mice tested. the nave CTLp frequencies are comparable for DbNP366 +V8.3+CD8+ and DbNPN3A+V8.3+CD8+ T cells and there is some overlap of some cross-reactive TCRs. Nave DbNPN3A+CD8+ T cells were assessed for conservancy of V8.3 bias. a single-cell PCR, amplification of V8.3 transcripts and sequencing. DbNPN3A selected distinct and more restricted TCR V signatures. single-cell RT-PCR and sequencing of the CDR3 region of tetramer+V8.3+CD8+ T cells followed either HK or HK-NPN3A infections showed that the mutant DbNPN3A+CD8+ T cells utilized different J regions (primary (10): J1.1, J1.3; secondary (20): J1.1, J1.6, J2.2) the reduction (relative to the wt DbNP366) in V8.3 usage by HK-NPN3A infection 10 response 20 response M1 M2 M3 M4 M5 M6 M7 CDR3 J aa NP N3A NP N3A NP N3A NP N3A NP N3A NP N3A NP N3A SGGANTGQL 2S2 9 3 9 2 5 SGGSNTGQL 2S2 9 11 1 2 3 SGGGSTGQF 2S2 9 12 1.5 99 3 SGGGN n.

HK infection of mice; 20 responses were generated by priming mice with i.p. PR8 all the statistical differences were confirmed when the data were standardized to a number of sequences. we further analyzed the DbNPN3A+V9+CD8+ set that was prominent in 2 of the HK-NPN3A secondarily challenged mice. an average of 1.51 TCR clonotypes was found within this population. mice that were primed with the PR8NPN3A and then challenged with either the wt HK or mutant HKNPN3A showed equivalent recall of DbNP3A+CD8+ T cells during the acute phase of the secondary response. this was detected by IFN- production (Fig 5A) and tetramer staining (data not shown) the magnitude of the CD8+ T cell response measured 8d after 20 infection was determined by the ICS assay for IFN-. the magnitude of the CD8+ T cell response measured 8d after 20 infection was determined by the ICS assay for IFN-. we performed prime-and-challenge studies in MT mice lacking B cells. antibody responses did not mask any possible inhibitory effects of \u201csuboptimal\u201d TCRs on viral clearance. these results indicate that recall of \u201csuboptimal\u201d TCRs can lead to delayed viral clearance. three (all expressing the SGGGNTGQL CDR3) T cell hybridoma lines [37] specific for DbNP366 were stimulated with the two peptides. this result is in accord with findings from both the TCR repertoire analysis of cross-reactive clonotypes. the response magnitudes determined following homologous and heterologous virus challenge reflects functional (defined as responsiveness to a peptide) pMHC-TCR avidity. wt DbNP366 or (E) DbNPN3A epitopes were assessed in lacZ assay. tetramer dilution technique assessed the overall pMHC-I avidity. pMHC-TCR avidity was assessed by three measures. tetramer \u201coff\u201d-rate by tetramer dissociation and (G\u2013I) CD8-dependence by anti-CD8 blocking combined with ICS. tetramer staining was performed in the presence of NaAz, then washed and incubated with anti-CD8 mAb. ining was measured using the DbNP366 and DbNPN3A tetramers. data represent meanSD (n = 4\u20135 mice per group), *p0.01. the relative size of persistent T cell pools reflects the extent of antigen driven proliferation during the acute anti-viral response. cells were stained with the DbNP366-PE, DbNPN3A-PE or DbPA224-PE tetramers and anti-CD8-PerCPCy5.5 mAb. the majority (90%) of CD8+ T cells elicited by HKNPN3A infection bound the DbNP366 tetramer and produced IFN- when stimulated by the NPN3A peptide. the majority (90%) of CD8+ T cells elicited by HKNPN3A infection bound the DbNP366 tetramer and produced IFN- when stimulated by the NPN3A peptide. tetramer staining and IFN- ICS detected dbNP366 +CD8+ and NPN3A+CD8+ T cells. both techniques gave us comparable antigen-specific CD8+ T cell numbers. if there was any effect on CD8+ cell function or phenotype, particularly for markers that discriminate between memory T cells. the structure of the H2Db-NP-N3A complex was compared to the wt DbNP366 [23]. the wt DbNP366 and DbNPN3A structures are very similar with a root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 0.44 on the 1\u20132 domains. the peptide is represented in stick conformation with the C terminus on the right. the peptide is represented in purple and (B) the NP366 in blue, with the p3 mutation in yellow. the mutation of P3-Asn to Ala leads to a loss of 35 contacts between the peptide and the MHC molecule. the mutation abolishes contacts between the P3 residue of the peptide with His155 and the Tyr156 of the MHC and eliminates one hydrogen bond between the P3-Asn2 and the P4-GluO. the NP366 and NPN3A peptides are equally effective at stabilising H-2Db. the pMHC-I complex with the NP366 wt peptide had a Tm of 51.80.7\u00b0C. the pMHC-I complex with the NP366 wt peptide had a Tm of 51.80.7\u00b0C. regions showed a clear difference from the comparable wt-specific set. the \u201cpublic TCR\u201d dominance characteristic of DbNP366 +V8.3+CD8+ T cells was not a prominent feature of the DbNPN3A-specific TCR repertoire. Nave DbNPN3A+ and DbNP366 +CD8+ T cell precursors within lymph nodes and spleens were identified with the DbNPN3A-PE and DbNP366-PE tetramers using an established tetramer enrichment protocol [53]. a CDR3 sequences within the nave DbNPN3A+V8.3+CD8+ T cells were determined by a single-cell PCR. clonotypes within the V8.3 could be highly relevant for cross-reactive CD8+ T cell responses between NP366 and NPN3A. single-cell RT-PCR and sequencing of the CDR3 region of tetramer+V8.3+CD8+ T cells showed that the mutant and the wt immune V8.3 repertoires appear different. this is in contrast to the DbNP366 +CD8+ V8.3+ TCR repertoire [34] that is largely comprised of high-frequency, public clonotypes found in all infected B6 mice. HK-NPN3A infection 10 response 20 response 10 response 20 response 20 response 20 response. 10 responses were generated by i.n. HK-NPN3A infection of mice. 20 responses were generated by priming mice with i.p. PR8-NPN3A virus. the majority of the TCR clonotypes were detected with both the DbNP366 and DbNPN3A tetramers. however, a switch in frequency was seen for some CDR3-defined clonotypes. the difference could reflect diversity in TCR usage. clonotypes like KGGSNTGQL 2S2 9 63 3 38 2 KGGGNTGQL 2S2 9 25 60 4 4 3 SGGQGNSPL 2S2 9 25 60 4 4 3 SGGQGNSPL 2S2 9 25 60 4 4 3 SGGQGNSPL 2S2 9 2 KAGGSTGQL 2S2 9 48 KAGGGTGQL 2S2 9 5 RALGRNTEV 1S1 9 2 3 SDAG the analysis suggests that only a subset of the repertoire generated by wt infection is able to recognize the DbNP3A epitope. this population is more diverse than that generated in response to the mutant NPN3A virus. an average of 1.51 TCR clonotypes was found within this population. response characteristics following heterologous challenge and TCR/pMHC-I avidity. it was important to determine whether memory T cells that cross-react for the DbNP366 and DbNPN3A epitopes are preferentially recalled by secondary infection with the heterologous virus. priming with the wt virus elicits CD8+ T cells that respond relatively well to a subsequent infection with cross-reactive variant. the diminished primary response may limit the full expansion of CD8+ T cells that respond relatively well to the subsequent wt infection. using NPN3A for either priming or the challenge gives an equally poor response. Lungs were sampled at days 5 and 6 after secondary infection. data represent the mean and n = 3\u20135 mice per group. n = p0.01 # = p0.05. the immune repertoire selected by DbNP3A shows evidence of equivalent avidity following stimulation with the NPN3A or NP366 peptides. the same effect was seen even more clearly when three (all expressing the SGGGNTGQL CDR3) T cell hybridoma lines [37] specific for DbNP366 were stimulated with the two peptides. this result is in accord with findings from both the TCR repertoire analysis of cross-reactive clonotypes peptide-pulsed splenocytes presenting the (D) wt DbNP366 or (E) DbNPN3A epitopes were assessed in lacZ assay [22]. tetramer dilution technique assessed the overall pMHC-I avidity. pMHC-TCR avidity was assessed by three measures: (A\u2013C) overall pMHC avidity (tetramer \u201con\u201d and \u201coff\u201d rates) by tetramer dilution, (D\u2013F) tetramer \u201coff\u201d-rate by tetramer dissociation and (G\u2013I) CD8-dependence by anti-CD8 blocking combined with ICS. tetramer staining was performed in the presence of NaAz, then washed and incubated with anti-CD8 mAb. the progressive diminution in tetramer staining was measured. the stability of the peptide-MHC-I complex remains constant for both NP366 and NPN3A. this suggests that the Asn3 as a secondary anchor does not play an important role in stabilizing the peptide within the MHC-I. the structural basis for the diminished recruitment of DbNPN3A-specific CD8+ T cells is thus likely to rest in the way that the partially-solvent exposed residue contacts MHC-I. the response overall for wt DbNP366 +CD8+ and NPN3A+CD8+ T cells is characterised by conserved, \u201cpublic\u201d clonotypes that constitute the majority of the selected TCR repertoire [34] the difference presumably reflects the lower TCR avidity for DbNP3A. both the DbNP366 +CD8+ and DbNPN3A+CD8+ T cell responses are characterised by quite distinct TCR repertoires. the majority are bound by both the NP366 and the NPN3A peptides. this suggests that a clonal dissection of TCR clonotypes is needed to make a valid interpretation of the truly cross-reactive CD8+ T cell responses. cross-reactive mutants that have characteristics comparable to NPN3A would be of no benefit. changes like the non-cross-reactive NP-M6A mutation [22] that induce a completely novel, high quality response might merit incorporation in an experimental vaccine or immunotherapy strategy. similar effects have been found for different epitopes derived from unrelated viruses. mice were first primed intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 1.5107 p.f.u. of the serologically distinct PR8 (H1N1) or modified PR8 (PR8-NPN3A) influenza A viruses, in 30l of PBS. recombinant influenza viruses with the single amino acid substitution (N3A) within the NP366 peptide, ASNENMETM, were generated using the eight-plasmid reverse genetics system. HKNPN3A and PR8-NPN3A were rescued following transfection of MDCK-293T cell co-culture with the eight plasmids encoding influenza segments. a viral titre was determined by plaque assay on monolayers of MDCK cells. spleens were disrupted and enriched for CD8+ T cells using goat anti-mouse IgG and IgM antibodies. tetramers were used at optimal concentrations (10\u201340g/ml) based on the percentage of epitope-specific CD8+ T cells and the mean fluorescence intensity of tetra. tetramer dilution and tetramer dissociation analyses CD8+ T cells from spleen were stained with the DbNP366 and Db-NPN3A tetramers conjugated to Streptavidin-PE (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 60mins at room temperature. for a tetramer dissociation assay, lymphocytes were stained at the optimal concentration of PE-conjugated tetra cells were removed at intervals, stained with FITC-conjugated mAb to CD8. loss of tetramer+CD8+ T cells at particular time-points was calculated in comparison to tetramer staining at t = 0mins. lymphocytes were pre-cultured in the presence or absence of anti-CD8 antibody (53.5\u20138) (10 g/ml) cells were then stimulated for 5 h with peptide, IL-2 and GolgiStop also in the presence or absence of anti-CD8 antibody (5 g/ml). cells were analysed for CD8 and IFN expression. the antibody cocktail contained anti-CD8-APC Cy7 (Pharmingen, BD), anti-CD4-PE Cy7 (eBiosciences), anti-B220-FITC (Pharmingen, BD), anti-CD11b-FITC (eBiosciences), anti-CD11c-FITC (eBiosciences), anti-F4/80-FITC (eBiosciences), anti-CD62L-APC (Pharmingen, BD) and cells cultured in the presence of NP366 or NPN3A peptides at concentrations ranging from 1015M to 104M for 18h at 370C. the cells were then washed with PBS, fixed with 100l of 2% formaldehyde/0.2% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 5min on ice, washed in PBS and incubated with 2.5mg of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-ind crystals were grown with a reservoir containing 0.1 M sodium citrate at pH 5.7, 28% PEG 3350 (w/v), 0.2 M lithium sulphate. the crystals belong to space group I222 and the unit cell dimensions were consistent with one molecule per asymmetric units. the coordinates of the H2Db-NP-N3A complex have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank under accession numbers 3FTG. the atomic coordinates have been deposited in the protein data bank under accession numbers 3FTG. mice were bred and housed under specific pathogen free conditions. mice were lightly anaesthetised by inhalation of methoxyflurane. mice were primed intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 1.5107 p.f.u. of the serologically distinct PR8 (H1N1) or modified PR8 (PR8-NPN3A) influenza A viruses, in 30l of PBS. HK-NPN3A and PR8-NPN3A were rescued after transfection of MDCK-293T cell co-culture with eight plasmids encoding influenza segments. a viral titre was determined by plaque assay on monolayers of MDCK cells. there was any evidence of altered fitness in vivo for the HKNPN3A virus. the spleens were disrupted and enriched for CD8+ T cells using goat anti-mouse IgG and IgM antibodies. tetramer and phenotypic staining of CD8+ T cells Lymphocytes from the BAL and spleen were stained with tetramers conjugated to Strepavidin-APC or PE. cells were washed twice in FACS buffer, and stained with 1 g/ml tetramer dilution and tetramer dissociation analyses CD8+ T cells from spleen were stained with the DbNP366 and Db-NPN3A tetramers conjugated to Streptavidin-PE (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 60mins at room temperature. for a tetramer dissociation assay, lymphocytes were stained at the optimal concentration of PE-conjugated tetra tetramer+CD8+ cells were washed and incubated in the presence of anti-H2Db antibody at 5g/ml at 370C. cells were removed at intervals, stained with the FITC-conjugated mAb to CD8 and analysed by flow cytometry. pMHC complex by CD8-dependence Splenocytes was obtained from mice sampled on d6 after secondary infection. lymph nodes and spleen samples were washed and resuspended in 400 l buffer with 100 l anti-PE microbeads. cells that had bound the microbeads were purified on a magnetic LS column according to manufacturers instructions. anti-CD8-APC Cy7 (Pharmingen, BD), anti-CD4-PE Cy7 (eBiosciences), anti-B220-FITC (Pharmingen, BD), anti-CD11b-FITC (eBiosciences), anti-CD11c-FITC (eBiosciences), anti-F4/80-FITC (eBiosciences), anti-CD62L-APC (Pharmingen, BD) and anti-CD3 cells were cultured in the presence of NP366 or NPN3A peptides at concentrations ranging from 1015M to 104M for 18h at 370C. cells were then washed with PBS, fixed with 100l of 2% formaldehyde/0.2% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 5min on ice, washed in PBS and incubated with 2.5mg of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-ind crystals were grown with a reservoir containing 0.1 M sodium citrate at pH 5.7, 28% PEG 3350 (w/v), 0.2 M lithium sulphate. the crystals belong to space group I222 and the unit cell dimensions were consistent with one molecule per asymmetric units. the coordinates of the H2Db-NP-N3A complex have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank under accession numbers 3FTG. the atomic coordinates have been deposited in the protein data bank. tetramer+ CD8+ cells were characterized for (A, B) CD62L and (C, D) IL-7R expression following primary (A, C; d10) or secondary (B, D; d8) challenge. ICS assay was used to measure cytokine production following in vitro stimulation with the cognate peptide following primary (E, G) or secondary (F, H) challenge. memory mice primed with either (A, D) PR8 or (B, C) PR8-NPN3A viruses were challenged with either (A, D) HK or (B, C) mutant HK-NPN3A virus. data represent mean and n = 5 mice per group. table S2 Frequency of TCRs in DbNPN3A+ V9+CD8+ T cells after 10 mutant HK-NPN3A infection detected with either the DbNP366 + or DbNPN3A+ tetramer."}
