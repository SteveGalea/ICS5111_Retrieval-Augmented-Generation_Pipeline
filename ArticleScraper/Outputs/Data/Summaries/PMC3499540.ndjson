{"summary": "nascent polypeptides are translocated cotranslationally across or into the ER membrane at sites termed translocons. the translocon minimally comprises one Sec61-- heterotrimer and associated proteins forming an aqueous conduit that aligns with the ribosome during translocation. signal sequences or transmembrane domains within a nascent polypeptide are recognized by the signal-recognition particle. nascent precursors are targeted in an SRP-dependent manner. the posttranslational pathway is used predominantly by precursors with low hydrophobic signal peptides. in the yeast, the cotranslational mode of protein translocation dominates. sec62 and sec63 are not lethal but are linked to polycystic liver disease. it is also suggested that both proteins can transiently associate with newly synthesized polypeptides during ER membrane integration in cell-free systems. ectopically expressed sec62 and sec63 constructs were transfected into human liver carcinoma cells. the constructs were transfected together with a membrane-anchored ER chaperone. the hydrophobic C-terminal half of HBV.S is predicted to further span the membrane two times resulting in a fourfold membrane-spanning protein. ectopically expressed Sec63 did not affect the level of HBV.S. cytotoxicity assays of cellular supernatants were performed. the fate of HBV.S was analyzed in cells overexpressing both sec62 and sec63 proteins. cells were transfected with HA-tagged HBV.S together with empty plasmid DNA (Control), Myc-tagged Sec62, Sec63, or Sec63C at a 13 DNA ratio (4 g total DNA), respectively. lysates were prepared with NP-40 (NP-40) and analyzed by HA- or Myc-specific Western blotting. lysates and supernatants of cotransfected cells were examined by an ELISA. lysates and supernatants of cotransfected cells were examined by an HBV.S-specific ELISA. overexpressed Sec63 reduced both the intra- and extracellular pool of HBV.S. endogeneous Sec63 was absent in lysates of siSec63-treated cells. exogeneous Sec63 was overexpressed about 3.2-fold. sec63 down-regulated HBV.S in a dose-dependent manner. lysates were prepared after three days and probed by anti-Sec63 WB. lysate was serially diluted prior to gel loading as indicated above lanes. total DNA used for transfections was adjusted with empty plasmid DNA (Control) this deficit can be abrogated by the addition of a foreign signal sequence to the N-terminus of HBV.L that blocks the formation of the dual topology and enables secretion [28]. overexpression of Sec63 decreased the non-glycosylated and glycosylated forms of both the wt HBV.L and HBV.Ile9::L signal fusion proteins. cell lysates were probed by anti-Myc (top) and anti-HA (bottom) WB. non-glycosylated (p) and glycosylated (gp, ggp, gggp) forms of the HBV constructs are indicated on the left of each panel. a bicistronic plasmid vector carrying expression units for HA-tagged HBV.L under the control of the human metallothionein IIa (hMTIIa) promoter and for HA-tagged Hip (Hsc70 interacting protein) under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter [22]. Upon cotransfection of HBV.L/Hip with Sec63, the level of HBV.L was again reduced, while the amount of cyto overexpression of sec63 acts during HBV.S formation in a proteasome-independent manner. cells transfected with sec63 were retransfected with sec63 two days later. cells were cotransfected with HBV.S plus control DNA or Myc-tagged Sec63. cells were mock-treated or treated with epoxomicin for 16 h. cell lysates were analyzed as in A. cytosol and the ER/secretory pathway, have been reported to participate in endogenous antigen processing [32] overexpressed Sec63 is a potent reducer of Steady-state levels of polytopic proteins. this pathway has been described in cells permanently replicating HBV.S. identical results were obtained when ER membrane proteins with a single membrane-spanning segment were analyzed. either a Golgi.YFP fusion construct encoding YFP with a N-terminal membrane anchoring signal peptide of 1,4-galactosyltransferase or the G glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus. overexpressing of Sec63 reduces steady-state levels of polytopic proteins. ER reporter constructs included soluble (A), single-pass membrane (B) and multi-pass membrane (C) proteins were used for cotransfection studies. each reporter was transfected with control DNA or Myc-tagged Sec63 at a 13 DNA ratio. the amounts of protected YFP.ER and Golgi.YFP chains were almost identical in control- and Sec63-overexpressing cells. overexpressing of Sec63 neither inhibits ER import of ER.YFP and Golgi.YFP nor grossly affects reporter gene transcription. both constructs were in identical vector backbones and under control of identical transcriptional elements. Upon cotransfection of either of the two constructs with control or Sec63 DNA, their common GFP-tag enabled immunodetection on the same gel. western blot analysis of cell lysates showed that both siRNA species depleted Sec63 by about 80% as compared to control-treated cells. the knock-down of Sec63 resulted in significant higher intracellular p24/gp27 levels as compared to control-treated cells. cell-associated HBV.S levels are demonstrated in percent amount SD relative to control cells. ERdj1 and ERdj4 do not Affect the Steady-state Pool of the Polytopic HBV.S Envelope Protein Beside Sec63 (i.e., ERdj2) ERdj4 is a soluble ER protein and plays a role in the degradation of ERAD substrates. it has the ability to associate with translating ribosomes, likely to modulate translation. lysates were prepared and assayed by WB using anti-FLAG. the yeast and mammalian Sec63 proteins have been shown to interact with the ER lumenal Kar2p/BiP chaperone in a productive manner [10], [12], [15] because mutations of this sequence abolish the functional interaction between J domains and their chaperone partners [40], [41] we reasoned to study a Sec63 mutant devoid of the HPD motif (Sec63HPD) lysates were subjected to anti-Myc (top), anti- -actin (middle) and anti-HA (bottom) WB. lysates were probed by anti--actin (top) and anti-HA (bottom) tinin (HA)-tagged version of the S envelope protein of HBV (HBV.S) is cotranslationally integrated into the ER membrane. the hydrophobic C-terminal half of HBV.S is predicted to further span the membrane two times. cell lysates were prepared with the non-denaturing detergent NP-40. in vitro-binding studies have identified the negatively charged C-terminus of Sec63 as the interaction domain for basic oligopeptide motifs within the N-terminus of Sec62 [14]. a truncated sec63 mutant lacking large parts of the cytosolic domain including the binding site argued against an essential role of sec62 in the observed action of Sec63. nuclei and organelle structures in the cell periphery are shown in the right panels. bar, 10 m. B. Cells were transfected with HA-tagged HBV.S together with empty plasmid DNA (Control), Myc-tagged Sec62, Sec63, or Sec63C at a 13 DNA ratio (4 g total DNA) three days after transfection, cellular lysates were prepared with NP-40 (NP-40) and analyzed by HA- or My overexpressed Sec63 reduced the intra- and extracellular pool of HBV.S. cells were depleted for sec63 by treatment with specific siRNA duplexes. exogeneous Sec63 was absent in lysates of siSec63-treated cells. an accompanying titration experiment showed that sec63 down-regulated HBV.S in a dose-dependent manner. thereby, the most prominent decline in the steady state level appeared when the concentration of the transfected Sec63 DNA was raised above 1.5 g/106 cells. this drop is unlikely to account for the impact of sec63 on the steady-state HBV.S pool. overexpressed Sec63 reduces the Steady-state levels of polytopic HBV Envelope Proteins Irrespective of Secretion, N-glycosylation and Cell Type. this mutant still enters the ER pathway but fails to assemble into intralumenal secretory SVPs [27] overexpression of sec63 reduces steady-state HBV envelope protein levels. hek293T cells were cotransfected with HA-tagged HBV.L and myc-tagged Sec63. cells were transfected with the bicistronic plasmid HBV.L/Hip encoding expression units for HA-tagged HBV.L and HA-tagged Hip. cell extracts were probed by anti-Myc (top), anti-actin (middle) and anti-HA (bottom) WB. some liver cells have been implicated in sec63 abnormalities. human Hip is a cytosolic cochaperone involved in the regulation of Hsc70 chaperone activity. this construct offered the chance to monitor the effect of excess Sec63 in the same cells and the same blot. overexpressed Sec63 acts during HBV.S Biogenesis in a Proteasome-independent Manner. overexpressing of sec63 acts during HBV.S formation in a proteasome-independent manner. cells transfected with HBV.S were retransfected with sec63 two days later. cells were stained with mouse anti-Myc and rat anti-HA antibodies. transfected cells were treated with proteasome inhibitor epoxomicin. epoxomicin degraded sec63 derivatives that accumulated in epoxomicin- but not in mock-treated cells. the inhibition of the ERAD pathway did not abolish the ability of excess Sec63 to down-regulate HBV.S. with sec63 measured in a split-ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid assay. this prompted us to examine whether or not Sec63 may play a more general role in the production of ER proteins. for soluble ER marker proteins, hemopexin (Hxp) and a yellow fluorescent ER fusion protein (YFP.ER) were used that are cotranslationally translocated across the ER membrane by virtue of their N-terminal cleaved signal coexpression studies showed that Sec63 neither down-regulated Golgi.YFP nor VSV.G. we then assessed the behavior of multi-spanning membrane proteins synthesized in the presence of up-regulated Sec63. anti-Hxp, MHV.M, and CD63 were probed with anti-HA antibodies, YFP.ER and Golgi.YFP were detected with anti-GFP antibodies. VSV.G was verified with anti-G-specific antibodies. reporter expression values were determined by densitometry. cytosolic green fluorescent protein (GFP) or GFP with a C-terminal fusion of CD63 (GFP.CD63) both constructs were in identical vector backbones and under the control of identical transcriptional elements. a common GFP-tag enabled immunodetection on the same gel. up-regulated Sec63 diminished the yield of the GFP.CD63 reporter. it had little effects on the cytosolic GFP protein. overexpressing of Sec63 reduces cotranslational insertion of GFP.CD63 without grossly affecting the translation of GFP. the intracellular increase of HBV.S was not due to a block in SVP secretion, since the extracellular amount of HBV.S was also elevated in sec63-depleted cells. these results indicate that Sec63 is per se not required for HBV.S production; rather, its limitation promotes HBV.S synthesis and/or stability. cell-associated HBV.S levels are demonstrated in percent amount SD relative to control cells (n = 2). cell lysates were subjected to immunoblotting using anti-Sec63 (top), anti-actin (middle), or anti-HA/VSV.G antibodies. overexpressed ERdj1 and ERdj4 do not Affect the Steady-state Pool of the Polytopic HBV.S Envelope Protein Beside Sec63. the overexpression of ERdj1 and ERdj4 does not affect the steady-state HBV.S level. lysates were prepared and assayed by WB using anti-FLAG (top), anti-actin (middle), or anti-HA antibodies. wt sec63 likewise reduced HBV.S, albeit its down-regulating activity was reproducibly less pronounced as compared to wt Sec63. similar results were obtained with the polytopic CD63 reporter (Fig. 10A) cell extracts were probed by WB with antibodies against Myc (top), FLAG (top middle), or HA (bottom) cell extracts were probed by WB with antibodies against myc (top), FLAG (top middle), or HA (bottom). inverse correlation between cell content of sec63 and level of particular ER substrates. overlapping roles for the mammalian proteins have not been documented. in vitro biochemical analyses of dog and bovine pancreatic microsomes revealed that only small fractions of Sec62 and Sec63 are associated with each other. the majority of these proteins were not found in a complex [10], [13] us studies have shown that such a model is likely to apply for the membrane integration of single-spanning membrane proteins. up to four TMs of one polypeptide could be present in the translocation channel at the same time concomitant with widening of the pore. translocon-associated ER lumenal factors, like the soluble BiP chaperone or the membrane-embedded OST complex, appear to influence translocation of nascent chains by mechanisms including trapping, modification, and/or folding. RNA interference data are in conflict with two recent works studying the loss of Sec63 function in vitro and in vivo. all polytopic cargos used in this work contain non-cleavable signal peptides. a greater panel of proteins will have to be analyzed to deduce the exact function of Sec63. the up-regulation of Sec63 could lead to trapping of BiP concomitant with defects in ER translocation and homeostasis. a recent analysis of the multi-spanning cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator has shown that the release of TMs from the Sec61 translocon is ATP-dependent [60], although \u2013 thus far \u2013 there are no known core translocon components that contain ATPase activity. the sec63/BiP participation may provide the missing link. pNI2.S.HA (HBV.S) and pNI2.L.HA (HBV.L) encode the S or the L gene. the HBV.STM1 mutant lacks the first TM segment of the S protein. the HBV.Ile9::L mutant carries the L gene with a foreign N-terminal signal sequence derived from human interleukin-9 [27], [28]. the construct for the human HA-tagged hemopexin (Hxp) has been described [61]. the construct for the human HA-tagged hemopexin (Hxp) has been described. human embryonic kidney 293T cells were transfected with LipoFectamineTM 2000 (invitrogen) the ratio of plasmid DNA used in (co)transfection experiments are indicated in the figure legends. for transfection of cells with siRNAs, the LipoFectamineTM RNAiMAX transfection reagent (invitrogen) was used. immunostaining was determined by enhanced chemiluminescence (Western Lightning\u00ae Plus\u2013ECL, PerkinElmer) and recorded on amersham Hyperfilm ECL. densitometric analysis of Western blot band intensities was based on linear, 8-bit, gray scale, transmitted light TIFF scans. Z-stack images were acquired separately for each channel using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M microscope equipped with a Plan-Apochromat 100 (1.4 NA) and a Zeiss Axiocam digital camera. for quantitative immunofluorescence analyses, images of randomly selected cells were collected at 100 magnification with identical settings. the PCR reaction was initiated by a single step at 50\u00b0C for 2 minutes and 95\u00b0C for 10 minutes followed by 38 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 15 seconds and 60\u00b0C for 60 seconds. the calculated data were converted into percentages whereupon the mean value of the control samples was set to 100%. Sec63HPD and Sec63C mutants were cloned into pCMV-Myc. Sec63HPD carries alanine substitutions of the amino acids (aa) HPD at positions 132 to 134. Sec63C contains a premature stop codon generated at aa position 444. the M envelope gene of MHV strain A59, present in plasmid pTZ19R-M [37], was a gift from P. J. M. Rottier (Utrecht University, The Netherlands) was subcloned into pCMV.HA (BD Biosciences, Clontech) for C-terminal tagging with the HA epitope. siRNA duplexes targeting the nucleotide positions 1942 to 1960 of Sec63 (CAAGAATGGTGGTGGCTTT) or esiRNA were used (Quiagen) nonsense siRNA with no known homology to mammalian genes was used (Quiagen) cells were treated with 1.5 M epoxomicin (Calbiochem) for 16 h prior to cell harvest. cells were lysed with either the non-denaturing detergent Nonidet P-40 (NP-40) or the denaturing reagent sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) lysates were prepared by incubating the cells with Tris-buffered saline (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5/150 trypsin protection assay microsomes were prepared from homogenized cells. microsomes were proteolyzed with trypsin in the presence or absence of 0.5% NP-40 for 60 min on ice. after inactivation of trypsin with aprotinin, solubilized samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. mRNA was treated with 5 U DNase I (Roche Applied Science) at 30\u00b0C for 20 minutes. mRNA levels were determined by a quantitative real-time PCR as absolute quantification using the standard curve method. serial dilutions of plasmid DNA containing the target DNA were amplified in parallel.
