{"summary": "analysis of viral quasispecies, microRNAs, and antibodyomes in nature. they discuss the wisdom of reducing artificial errors during sample preparation. they describe recent advances in understanding of biogenesis and functions of microRNAs in the virus-cell battles. researchers present existing experimental datasets of the host-pathogen interactome. they discuss approaches to obtain structural interactome by integrating biophysical, functional, and evolutionary information. they describe importance of incorporating in silico modeling techniques into experimental studies. the data from two time-course experiments of infections with a cell-free virus stock are used to estimate the half-life of infected cells, viral production rate of an infected cell, and the basic reproductive number. takemura and Murakami (2012) reviewed structure and function of HIV-1 capsid proteins. they describe their abilities to form a conical core in a virion or to interact with various cellular proteins that promote or suppress viral replication. s and examples of \"Frontiers in Virology\" to elucidate viral diversity, protein 3-D structures, virus-host interactions, and evolution of RNA viruses."}
