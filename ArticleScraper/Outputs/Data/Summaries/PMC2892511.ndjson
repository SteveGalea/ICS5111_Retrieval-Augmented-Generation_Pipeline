{"summary": "in humans, cell-free virions are released from skin lesions. infection is exclusively by cell-to-cell spread of virus. lack of high titer cell-free virus has hindered progress of studies. recombinant soluble IDE (rIDE) modifies gE, induces a conformation change in gE, enhances VZV infectivity, and stabilizes cell-free virus. results rIDE augments cell-free VZV infectivity at an early stage of infection and enhances VZV infectivity. rIDE was purified, eluted and stained with coomassie blue. rIDE is expressed as a 110 kDa protein in insect cells. rIDE was purified, eluted and stained with coomassie blue. rIDE from cloned cDNA expressed in baculovirus-infected cells enhanced VZV infectivity. the difference in the activity of these two proteins could be due to the difference in their amino termini. rIDE is required to enhance infectivity and that rIDE functions at an early stage of infection. cell-free VZV (ROka-LacZ) virus was pre-treated with buffer, bovine serum albumin (BSA), rIDE (15 g/ml) or denatured rIDE (IDE treated with acid) at 37\u00b0C for 15 min before infecting melanoma cells. infected cells were stained with X-gal at 3 days after infection to identify the number of VZV-positive foci. cell-free ROka-LacZ virus was incubated with buffer, bovine serum albumen (BSA), filtrate that passed through without binding to a rIDE purification column. rIDE increased virus infectivity when incubated with cell-free ROka-lacZ for 1 or 3 hr at 37\u00b0C compared with buffer or with filtrate passing through the rIDE purification column. the experiment was performed 3 times, and a representative result is shown. cell-free ROka-GFP virus was incubated with medium, BSA, rIDE or denatured rIDE for 60 min at 4\u00b0C before infecting cells. the experiment was preformed 11 times and a representative experiment is shown. rIDE promotes VZV internalization during entry and cell-to-cell spread of virus. melanoma cells were infected with ROka-lacZ 2.5 hrs later the inoculum was removed by washing with PBS, rIDE was added to the cells, and 3 days later the cells were stained with X-gal. rIDE modifies VZV gE and induces a conformational change in gE IDE is a metalloproteinase. previously, we incubated the extracellular domain of gE (gEt) with IDE protein extracted from liver. the proteins were then boiled in sample buffer, separated on an SDS-PAGE gel. rIDE modifies gEt and induces conformational change in gEt. biotin labeled gEt-Fc protein (arrow) was incubated with rIDE at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. proteins were visualized with streptavidin-conjugated horse radish peroxidase. biotin-labeled gEt-His protein was incubated with rIDE (produced by baculovirus), IDE-E111Q (produced in bacteria) or negative control proteins as indicated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min, followed by thermolysin. many viral glycoproteins undergo conformational changes after binding their receptor or co-receptor. incubation of gEt with rIDE resulted in a reduction in the intensity of the 70 kDa gEt band. similar results were also observed with endoproteinase Asp-N digestion. rIDE triggered a conformational change in VZV gEt. melanoma cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding -galactosidase. the cells were incubated for 20 hr with melanoma cells expressing T7 polymerase that contained equal titers (105 PFU/ml) of control VZV (ROka) or a mutant virus, ROka68D32-71 that lacks IDE binding domain of gE. the cells were lysed, incubated with chlorophenol red--D-galactopyranoside, and \u2013galactosidase activity was measured using a spectrophotometer at OD570 nm. the experiment was performed at 16 hr and 24 hr and similar results were obtained. cells infected with ROka68D32-71-GFP had significantly fewer nuclei per syncytium than cell infected with ROka-GFP. the total number of nuclei in syncytia was quantified using 3D reconstruction of sequential Z-sections of cells with confocal microscopy. melanoma cells infected with ROka68D32-71 showed large numbers of enveloped virions accumulating at cell-cell junctions. in 53 randomly selected immune-electron micrographs, there were a total of 873 gE-positive ROka68D32-71 virions on the cell surface and/or in cell junctions. gE from both parental and mutant VZV showed similar levels of myristylation. cell-to-cell spread of gE is important for membrane fusogenicity, syncytia formation, and cell-to-cell spread. rIDE increases cell-free VZV infectivity at an early stage of infection and enhances stability of cell-free virus. recombinant baculovirus was constructed to express human IDE with a hemaglutinin (HA) tag inserted after the second methionine (amino acid 42) of IDE driven by polyhedrin promoter. rIDE was expressed as a 110 kD protein (Fig. 1B), although gel filtration showed oligomerization of the protein as has been reported previously. gEt, gEt lacking the IDE binding domain (gEt32-71), gEt defective in binding to VZV gI (gEt163-208), and a negative control protein (P7.5, vaccinia 7.5 protein) previously we showed that IDE interacts with the extracellular domain of VZV gE. rIDE also formed a complex with the extracellular domain of gE. rIDE significantly enhanced VZV infectivity compared with control protein or SPGC buffer alone. rIDE was added at 4 hr post-infection which bypasses the entry step. the native form of rIDE is required to enhance infectivity. rIDE functions at an early stage of infection and increases the stability of virus. cell-free ROka-LacZ virus was incubated with rIDE or buffer at 37\u00b0C for 15 min and kept at 25\u00b0C for 18 hrs before infecting cells and staining with X-gal. for the last two bars, the virus was incubated with increasing concentrations of rIDE at 37\u00b0C for 15 min. infected cells were stained with X-gal at 4 days post-infection. incubation of rIDE and cell-free virus at 4\u00b0C for 60 min before infection of cells also augmented VZV infectivity. rIDE enhances VZV infectivity and increases the stability of virus. incubation of rIDE with virus prior to infection resulted in increased numbers of VZV genomes inside the cells. rIDE increases virus internalization (P0.0001 for both rIDE vs. BSA control and rIDE vs. Buffer, Fig. 4A) rIDE promotes cell-to-cell spread of virus. melanoma cells were infected with ROka-lacZ, rIDE was added to the cells, and 3 days later the cells were stained with X-gal. rIDE modifies gE and induces conformational change in gE IDE is a metalloproteinase. rIDE protein was extracted from liver and did not detect cleavage or degradation of gEt using a monoclonal antibody. gEt was stained with streptavidin conjugated-horse radish peroxidase. rIDE modifies gEt after incubation at 4\u00b0C. biotin-labeled gEt-His protein was incubated with rIDE or control proteins at 37\u00b0C for 30 min, followed by urea for 18 hr and thermolysin for 30 sec. proteins were separated by electropheresis, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and processed as described in panel B. limited exposure of ligand-receptor complexes to proteinase has been used to detect receptor-induced conformational changes in several proteins. avian sarcoma/leucosis virus envelope protein complexed with its receptor Tva and spike protein of mouse hepatitis virus complexed with soluble receptor, CEACAM1a [20], [21], [22]. IDE mutant protein, IDE-E111Q, is catalytically inactive for insulin degradation. gEt failed to elicit a conformational change in gEt as compared with rIDE or wild-type IDE. a VZV mutant lacking the IDE binding domain of gE is impaired for membrane fusion. melanoma cells expressing T7 polymerase were infected with the same MOI of ROka-GFP or ROka68D32-71-GFP. melanoma cells expressing T7 polymerase were infected with the same MOI of ROka-GFP or ROka68D32-71-GFP. incubated with chlorophenol red--D-galactopyranoside, and \u2013galactosidase activity was measured using a spectrophotometer at OD570 nm. the experiment was performed twice with similar results. to further examine the function of IDE in VZV infection, we analyzed syncyctia formation in cells infected with ROka68D32-71. the number of nuclei in syncytia per nucleus was determined using spot function in Imaris software. n represents the number of syncytia analyzed in which nuclei were counted. the impairment in syncytia formation and cell-to-cell spread of the mutant virus is not due to defective maturation with reduced transport to the cell surface or to cell-cell junctions. gE from both parental and mutant VZV showed similar levels of myristylation. gE from both parental and mutant VZV showed similar levels of myristylation. multiple cells from the experiment in panel A were coded and observed. gE positive viral particles at cell surface and/or junctions were counted. soluble rIDE enhances VZV infectivity and cell-to-cell spread. gE produced by baculovirus forms a complex with IDE [3], suggesting that glycosylation of gE may not be important for interaction with IDE. gE produced by baculovirus forms a complex with IDE [6], [8], suggesting that IDE must interact only with the 73 kDa form of gE in the cytosol. a mixture of forms of gE ranging from 50\u2013100 kDa are present in purified virions. the 73 kDa form of gE is present in virions where it may interact with IDE. soluble receptor-mediated enhancement of virus infectivity has been reported for several viruses including avian leukosis/sarcoma virus. rIDE increases internalization of VZV DNA within 90 min of initiating infection. virus was pre-incubated with rIDE or control proteins at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. cells were lysed and radioactivity bound to cells was measured. rIDE, a metalloproteinase, triggers a conformational change in gE and modifies the size of gE. this suggests that a proteolytic activity of IDE might be important for VZV infectivity. previous work by Hambleton and colleagues suggested VZV enters human fibroblasts through an endocytosis pathway. endogenous IDE localizes primarily in endosomes and other subcellular compartments with about 10% on the cell surface or in extracellular spaces. rIDE increased the stability of cell-free VZV. there are two possible explanations for how rIDE might enhance virus stability. VZV lacking the IDE binding domain of gE is impaired for virus-induced membrane fusion, syncytia formation and cell-to-cell spread. gE promotes fusion when co-expressed with either gB or gH in transfected cells or using a vaccinia virus expression system. fibroblast cells (MRC-5, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were grown in Minimum Essential Medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) SF9 or H5 (Spodoptera frugiperda) insect cells were cultured in TNM-FH medium (BD Biosciences Pharmingen, San Diego, CA).
