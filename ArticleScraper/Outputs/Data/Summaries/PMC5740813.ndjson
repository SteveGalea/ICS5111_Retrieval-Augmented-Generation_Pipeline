{"summary": "chronic periodontitis (CP) is an infectious disease that affects the periodontium and gradually destroys periodontal tissues. it stimulates a local inflammatory response and activation of the innate immune system (1,2) this eventually results in the characteristic pathology of periodontal disease. many studies have highlighted the role of T lymphocyte cells in periodontitis. IL-35 therapy shows promising potential for the treatment of immunological and infectious diseases (15,18) study included 20 patients with CP (the CP group) and 20 healthy individuals (the control group) trial participants were assessed for probing depth (PD) and clinical attachment level (CAL) testing was conducted for six sites per tooth for all teeth. a tooth site without untreated caries, overhang fillings, food impaction or any inflammation with the exception of CP in each quadrant was selected. RNAiso Reagent (Takara Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Dalian, China) was added to each sample. PBMCs were isolated from 2 ml blood by density gradient centrifugation. PBMCs and sera were separately stored at 80\u00b0C until use. 2 l cDNA was added per well, using three wells per sample. target gene expression was normalized to GAPDH mRNA expression. mRNA analysis showed 20 patients per group were included. a standard curve was generated, and data were expressed in units of pg/ml IL-35 per liter of serum or GCF. an unpaired Student's t-test was used to analyze differences between groups using SPSS version 19.0 software. trial participants were assessed for probing depth (PD) and clinical attachment level (CAL) by a single examiner using a Florida Probe system. tests were conducted for six sites per tooth for all teeth. a tooth site without untreated caries, overhang fillings, food impaction or any inflammation was selected. PBMCs were isolated from 2 ml blood by density gradient centrifugation. peripheral blood taken at rest was centrifuged (20\u00b0C, 400 g for 20 min) and serum aspirated into new tubes. RNA quality was determined using a bioanalyzer. in the qPCR process, 2 l cDNA was added per well, using three wells per sample. target gene expression was normalized to GAPDH mRNA expression. the adjusted expression for healthy individuals was used as a reference. an unpaired Student's t-test was used to analyze differences between groups using SPSS version 19.0 software. the correlation analysis between clinical indicators and cytokines was analyzed by the Pearson rank correlation test. testing was conducted for six sites per tooth for all teeth. a tooth site without untreated caries, overhang fillings, food impaction or any inflammation was selected. a second molar or a premolar in the same quadrant was selected. from 2 ml blood by density gradient centrifugation using the separation medium Ficoll according to the manufacturer's instructions. peripheral blood taken at rest was centrifuged (20\u00b0C, 400 g for 20 min) and serum aspirated into new tubes. cDNA was added per well, using three wells per well. target gene expression was normalized to GAPDH mRNA expression. adjusted expression for healthy individuals was used as a reference. the correlation analysis between clinical indicators and cytokines was analyzed by the Pearson rank correlation test. results Patient information and clinical parameters A total of 40 participants were included in this study. the mean age of the CP group was 37.122.55 years and that of the healthy group was 35.232.36 years. in periodontal tissue (Foxp3, 2.21-fold; IL-12p35, 2.49-fold; EBi3, 2.27-fold; P0.05 for all) was observed for the CP group. mRNA expression levels of Foxp3, IL-12p35 and EBi3 were also examined in PBMCs using RT-qPCR. EBi3 mRNA expression was performed using primers for Foxp3, IL-12p35 and EBi3 mRNAs. data are expressed as the mean + standard error of the mean for each group (n=20) the mean concentration of IL-35 protein in (A) GCF and (B) serum of patients from the healthy control and CP groups as determined using ELISA. data are expressed as the mean + standard error of the mean for each group. the CP group consisted of 7 men and 13 women. the healthy group was composed of 6 men and 14 women. differences in age and sex were not statistically significant between the two groups. healthy and periodontal tissue biopsies were collected from patients. mRNA extracted and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction performed using primers for Foxp3, IL-12p35 and EBi3 mRNAs. IL-35 protein in GCF and serum Table III and Fig. 3 show the mean levels of IL-35 protein in the CP and healthy control groups. the mean concentration of IL-35 protein in the GCF and serum was significantly higher for the CP group compared with the healthy group. the concentration of IL-35 in the GCF with the CAL at detection sites of the CP group exhibited a negative correlation (P0.001, R2=0.6101; Fig. 4A) the concentration of IL-35 in the serum of the CP group with CAL at detection sites exhibited a negative correlation (P0.001, R2=0.9119; Fig. 4B) the mean PD and CAL for the CP group were significantly higher than those of the healthy control and CP group. CP, chronic periodontitis; PD, probing depth; CAL, clinical attachment level. mRNA expression levels of Foxp3, IL-12p35 and EBi3 were also examined in PBMCs using RT-qPCR. mRNA expression levels of IL-12p35 and EBi3 were also examined in PBMCs. the mean concentration of IL-35 protein was 205.561.61 ng/ml in GCF and 330.424.30 ng/ml in serum from the CP group. for the healthy control group it was 101.880.37 ng/m in GCF and 206.8910.06 ng/ml in serum. IL-35 is an immunosuppressive/anti-inflammatory cytokine, expressed by Foxp3+ Treg cells, that belongs to the IL-12 family of cytokines (24). IL-35 is a dimeric protein comprised of an chain (p35) and a chain (EBi3) (14). IL-12 family, IL-35 acts as an inhibitory factor for chronic inflammation, autoimmune disease and other immune disorders (7). it has also been suggested that IL-35 plays a central role in infection and immune regulation (26), which includes inhibiting the proliferation of T cells and their effects. a loss of IL-35 is associated with the progression of various diseases. IL-12p35 and EBi3 (IL-35) mRNAs were analysed using RT-qPCR in PBMCs and periodontal tissues. this is a similar result to that of Kalburgi et al, which is the only other study to address the role of IL-35 in periodontal disease. IL-35 is a relatively recently identified cytokine that has not been studied in many disease models. it is unclear whether IL-35 enhances or antagonizes the effects of other cytokines or immune cells in CP. it will be necessary to increase sample sizes and study a greater number of parameters to more fully understand the role of IL-35 in CP."}
