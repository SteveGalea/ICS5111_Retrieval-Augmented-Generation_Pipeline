{"summary": "RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is central to the replication of RNA viruses. it is a key regulator of nucleotide selectivity and fidelity (9, 10) viable viruses are recoverable only within a 4-fold range of RdRp fidelity (11\u201314) coVs infect a wide array of species and have emerged as highly pathogenic human pathogens twice in this century. first with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003 (27) and then with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 (28) coVs replicate with higher fidelity than all other known positive-sense RNA viruses (29, 30) the presence of conserved RdRp motifs and modeling of the C-terminal half of nsp12 predict an RdRp domain that is structurally similar to those of other RNA viruses. the demonstrated function of nsp14-ExoN in high-fidelity coV replication raises the questions of whether and how nsp12-RdRp participates in fidelity regulation. nsp12-RdRp shares common determinants of nucleotide selectivity with nsp14-ExoN. nsp12-RdRp has likely evolved to function in cooperation with nsp14-ExoN rather than independently. mutagenesis was used to generate point mutations in individual MHV genome cDNA fragment plasmids using the previously described MHV infectious clone reverse genetics system. mutant viruses were recovered in cocultured BHK-R and DBT cells following electroporation of in vitro-transcribed genome RNA in BHK-R cells. the treatment was removed, and the inoculum was added and allowed to adsorb for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. the inoculum was then removed, and medium with drug or DMSO was returned. infection proceeded for 24 h for nsp14-ExoN() viruses. supernatants were also used for RNA genome isolation by adding 100 l supernatant to 900 l TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), chloroform extraction by phase separation, and using the aqueous layer in the PureLink mini RNA kit (Ambion) one-step RT-qPCR was performed as described below. primers used were forward, 5\u2032-AGAAGGTTACTGGCAACTG-3\u2032, and reverse, 5\u2032-TGTCCACGGCTAAATCAAAC-3\u2032. the final volume for reaction mixtures was 20 l, with 150 nM probe, 900 nM each primer, 2 l sample RNA, and 10 l 2 ToughMix one-step low ROX enzyme mix (Quantas) used per reaction. 3I and nsp12-M611F viruses in both the WT and nsp14-ExoN() backgrounds. total RNA was sequenced across a 1.7-kb region of nsp12-RdRp. the infections were allowed to progress for 20 h, and then RNA was isolated. the ViVan pipeline identified statistically significant variants above the background noise due to sequencing error. each variant allele's rate was initially modified according to its covering read qualities based on a maximum-likelihood estimation. in all experiments, a minimum coverage of 3,000 reads was obtained. all virus work was performed using the recombinant MHV strain MHV-A59 (GenBank accession number AY910861 [42]). the MHV RdRp domain structure was generated with the Phyre2 online program (43) using nsp12 residues 385 to 887, which correspond to the reported SARS-CoV nsp12-RdRp model (40) P1 working stocks were made by infecting DBT cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) and freezing them when 80% were involved in syncytia, approximately 24 h p.i. for WT viruses and 36 h p.i. for nsp14-ExoN() viruses (2 or 3 rounds of replication). total infected-cell RNA was obtained with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) at various times postinfection. two-step reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed. RNA for the standard curve was then generated using an mMessage mMachine T7 kit (Ambion) an agarose gel with 1% bleach was run, and an 900-nt band was observed. the standard curve was graphed, and the number of genomes per milliliter was determined. total RNA was harvested when 50 to 70% of the monolayer was involved in syncytia. amplicons were generated using primers designed to cover the region including the codons for both the V553 and M611 residues. 12 amplicons were generated to cover the whole genome. amplicons were subsequently purified with a nucleospin PCR purification kit (Macherey-Nagel), quantified with PicoGreen, fragmented (Fragmentase) and prepared using the Illumina NextSeq500 Mid Output 150-cycle kit. a series of nsp12-RdRp truncations was assessed, and the highest-confidence model was used for further study. the model was resolved by highest-probability similarity to human rhinovirus serotype 14 (PDB ID 1XR5) the nsp12-RdRp core domain model was aligned with the solved structure of CVB3 (PDB ID 3DDK) a series of CVB3 RdRp mutations have been shown to result in decreased fidelity (10, 11, 54) the nsp12 amino acid sequences of 27 different -, -, and -CoVs were aligned. the modeled MHV RdRp structure (B) was aligned with the solved CVB3 RdRp structure (C) the residues chosen for site-directed mutagenesis were selected by comparing previously determined fidelity-altering mutations of picornavirus RdRps. nsp12-V553I, -M611F, -W613Y, -A621G, -Y649H, and -K794R were recovered. the time required for recovery of mutant viruses in the WT background ranged from 24 to 48 h. 5-FU has been used with picornaviruses, influenza viruses, vesicular stomatitis viruses. nsp14-ExoN() mutants are profoundly sensitive to 5-FU inhibition. the effect of 5-FU on DBT cell viability was previously tested. s, V553I and M611F confer resistance to 5-FU. this suggests that it is not possible to increase the exclusion of 5-FU beyond the high level dictated by nsp14-ExoN. this suggests that selectivity for native nucleotides over 5-FU is in fact increased by nsp12 mutations. the low titer from the nsp14-ExoN() background precluded direct-sequencing analysis. nsp12-V553I and nsp12-M611F mutant viruses replicated in comparison to their isogenic backgrounds. in the wild-type background, both mutant viruses had slightly delayed exponential replication but eventually reached similar peak titers comparable to the WT. nsp14-ExoN() background for both nsp12-V553I and nsp12-M611F. the results support the hypothesis that nsp14-ExoN and nsp12-RdRp may have an epistatic relationship. however, for replication kinetics, the effects of nsp12-V553I and nsp12-M611F were not observed in the presence of inactive n nsp12-M611F and nsp12-V553I mutants tested for changes in specific infectivity when infected at an MOI of 0.01. nsp12-M611F and nsp12-V553I mutants showed increased ratio of infectious particles to total particles (RNA genomes) in the nsp14-ExoN() background. the error bars represent SEM (*, P 0.05 by 2-way analysis of variance [ANOVA] using the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. nsp12-V553I or nsp12-M611F conferred any cost in fitness, defined as the ability to directly compete during coinfection. nsp12-V553I/nsp14-ExoN() was not able to compete with nsp14-ExoN() at any ratio. treatment with 60 M 5-FU again favored nsp12-M611F/nsp14-ExoN(). however, even then, the percentage of the population made up of nsp12-M611F/nsp14-ExoN() virus remained at only around 30% DBT cells were infected with nsp12-V553I, nsp12-V553I/nsp14-ExoN(), nsp12-M611F, or nsp12-M611F/nsp14-ExoN() virus at an initial MOI of 0.01. the nsp12-V553I mutation was stable after passage in both WT and nsp14-ExoN nsp12-V553I mutation is stable across passages; however, nsp12-M611F is vulnerable to reversion. mutant viruses in the WT and nsp14-ExoN() backgrounds are shown. the original mutation for each of the viruses is shown above the graph. nsp12-M611F/nsp14-ExoN() mutant virus showed no difference in resistance to 5-AZC compared with nsp14-ExoN() alone. these data suggest that nsp12-V553I is likely a fidelity determinant, whereas nsp12-M611F confers specific resistance to 5-FU. this result is consistent with the rapid reversion observed for the nsp12-M61 nsp12-V553I, nsp12-M611F, nsp14-ExoN(), nsp12-V553I/nsp14-ExoN(), or nsp12-M611F/nsp14-ExoN() virus at an MOI of 0.01, and RNA was collected at 20 h p.i. mutations present at 1% or more of the population were graphe the nsp12-M611F/nsp14-ExoN() virus fully reverted at both engineered nsp12-M611F nucleotides during the low-MOI infection. this reversion made the results for the nsp12-M611F/nsp14-ExoN() virus uninterpretable. the nsp3 mutation that arose in the nsp14-ExoN() population was not present prior to the final low-MOI infection. it is possible that either of the mutations resulted in a change in the types of mutations occurring during replication. nsp14-ExoN, nsp12-V553I or nsp12-M611F were infected at an MOI of 0.01, and total RNA was collected. the statistically significant mutations present at 1% of the total population are shown for the wild type, nsp14-ExoN, and nsp12-V553I. model was resolved by highest-probability similarity to human rhinovirus serotype 14 (PDB ID 1XR5), rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (PDB ID 1KHV) and enterovirus 71 (EV71). nsp12-RdRp core domain model was aligned with solved structure of CVB3 (PDB ID 3DDK) using PyMol. nsp12-V553A/I, -M611F, -W613Y, -A621G, -Y694H/W, and -K794R. resulting substitution mutations were engineered in the isogenic cloned MHV genome. recovery of mutant viruses in the MHV nsp14-ExoN(+) and nsp14-ExoN() isogenic backgrounds was attempted a maximum of 3 times. the time required for recovery of mutant viruses in the WT background ranged from 24 to 48 h. sp12-V553I/nsp14-ExoN() was 84 h, and that for nsp12-M611F/nsp14-ExoN() was 96 h. working stocks of all the viruses were made by infecting DBT cells at an MOI of 0.01 and recovering stocks at around 24 h p.i. for mutant viruses in the nsp14-ExoN() background. nsp12-M611F/nsp14-ExoN() and nsp12-V553I/nsp14-ExoN() mutant viruses were significantly less sensitive to 5-FU than nsp14-ExoN() alone. both populations persisting when treated with 120 M 5-FU, where nsp14-ExoN() was not detectable beyond 80 M 5-FU. this suggests that it is not possible to increase the exclusion of 5-FU nsp12-Y649H, -W613Y, and -K794R were viable in the nsp14-ExoN(+) background but failed to grow in the absence of proofreading. the low titer from the nsp14-ExoN() background precluded direct-sequencing analysis. in the nsp14-ExoN() background, RNA synthesis levels were indistinguishable from the nsp14-ExoN() background for both nsp12-V553I and nsp12-M611F. the results, along with the ability to recover several of the nsp12-RdRp mutants only in the nsp14-ExoN(+ background, support the hypothesis that nsp14- nsp12-V553I and nsp12-M611F mutants tested for changes in specific infectivity. nsp12-M611F and nsp12-V553I mutants showed increased ratio of infectious particles to total particles (RNA genomes) nsp12-V553I and nsp12-M611F demonstrated delays in replication and impaired RNA accumulation. nsp12-V553I and nsp12-M611F demonstrated delays in replication and impaired RNA accumulation. nsp12-V553I/nsp14-ExoN() was coinfected with nsp14-ExoN(). a small advantage for nsp12-V553I/nsp14-ExoN() was observed. nsp12-M611F/nsp14-ExoN() was not able to compete with nsp14-ExoN(). DBT cells were infected with nsp12-V553I, nsp12-V553I/nsp14-ExoN(), nsp12-M611F, or nsp12-M611F/nsp14-ExoN() virus at an initial MOI of 0.01. after 5 passages, the viruses were analyzed for retention of original mutations using dideoxy (Sanger) sequencing. the nsp12-M611F/nsp14-ExoN() population resulted in a mixture of 2-nucleotide changes, resulting in reversion to AUG (methionine) (68% of the population); single nucleotide changes that resulted in mutation to Leu (55% of the population); or retaining a Phe substitution (27% of the population). thus, the fitness cost of nsp12-M611F results the nsp12-V553I/nsp14-ExoN() mutant virus was more resistant to 5-AZC than nsp14-ExoN() alone. the nsp12-M611F mutant virus showed no difference in resistance to 5-AZC compared with nsp14-ExoN() alone. nsp12-V553I and nsp12-M611F mutations resulted in resistance to 5-FU. nsp12-V553I and nsp12-M611F mutations also conferred resistance to 5-AZC. RNA was collected at 20 h p.i. the nsp12-M611F/nsp14-ExoN() virus fully reverted at both engineered nsp12-M611F nucleotides during the low-MOI infection. nsp12-M611F mutations were still present at 100% of the population and resulted in a 1.93-fold increase in the number of accumulated mutations. neither sample appeared to have mutations concentrated in specific locations across the genome. one mutation in nsp3 of the nsp14-ExoN() sample and a mutation in the nsp3, nsp13, and E proteins of nsp12-V553I/nsp14-ExoN() reached nearly 100% of the sample population. nsp12-M611F likely confers broad resistance to incorporation of incorrect nucleotides. but this resistance is not likely to be due to broad resistance to the incorporation of alternate nucleotides. nsp12-RdRp fidelity is likely dependent on multiple proteins, including the RdRp and proofreading ExoN. nsp12-V553I and M611F mutations confer a replication cost in the WT background, but only partially compensates for the loss of nsp14-ExoN high fidelity. Picornavirus functional RdRps contain only RdRp domains (58, 59) this is not the case for many viral RdRps, including CoVs (26, 39). a nucleotidyltransferase activity was identified in this CoV-specific domain. the predicted RdRp core domain could be modeled with high confidence using bioinformatic approaches. fidelity and nucleotide selectivity have been investigated extensively in picornaviruses, especially poliovirus (12, 15, 51, 53, 60, 61) mutations at the same residues in the RdRp affect fidelity differently; poliovirus mutations generally result in increased fidelity and CVB3 mutations in decreased fidelity (11) nsp12-RdRp and nsp14-ExoN encode nsp14-ExoN, which functions as a proofreading enzyme (29, 30, 33, 35). nsp14-ExoN encodes nsp14-ExoN, which functions as a proofreading enzyme (29, 30, 33, 35), which together function as an elongation factor (63) and a primase (64, 65), and nsp13 coV nsp12-RdRp may have been selected specifically for replication speed. nsp12-V553I and nsp12-M611F resulted in increased replication lag phases. however, early RNA synthesis was not observed in the nsp14-ExoN() background. this may be due to a very minimal change that is not measureable even with the deep-sequencing technology used in this study. nsp14-ExoN() mutations confer genotypically and phenotypically stable attenuation in vivo. the concept of a high-level mutator as a mechanism for attenuation in live viruses may be problematic. all coV nsp12 proteins contain a \u201cCoV-specific\u201d domain of over 350 amino acids at the N terminus of the protein. a nucleotidyltransferase activity was identified in this CoV-specific domain. the predicted RdRp core domain could be modeled with high confidence using bioinformatic approaches. mutations at the same residues in the RdRp of poliovirus and CVB3 affect fidelity differently. poliovirus mutations generally result in increased fidelity and CVB3 mutations in decreased fidelity. nsp12-RdRp and nsp14-ExoN cooperate to optimize fidelity and replication kinetics. nsp14-ExoN encoded in nsp10 (33, 62), nsp7, and nsp8, which together function as an elongation factor (63) and a primase (64, 65), and nsp13, which functions as a helicase (66). these proteins interact with each other and likely function as a multiprotein replication-fidelity complex (34, 38) nsp14-ExoN() protein is trying to remove incorrect nucleotides. nsp14-ExoN() would be epistatic to nsp12-RdRp in relation to speed. nsp14-ExoN() is obscuring decreases in replication speed caused by mutations in nsp12-RdRp itself. nsp14-ExoN() mutations confer stable attenuation in vivo. but the concept of a high-level mutator as a mechanism for attenuation in live viruses may be problematic. the identification of increased fidelity mutations in the RdRp may compensate for the fidelity impairment of nsp14-ExoN() viruses."}
