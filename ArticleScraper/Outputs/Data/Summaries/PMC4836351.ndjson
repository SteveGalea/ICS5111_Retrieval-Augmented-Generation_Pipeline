{"summary": "human bocavirus type 1 (HBoV1) was isolated in 2005 in nasopharyngeal aspirates of children (2 years old) suffering from acute respiratory tract infections. HBoV1 was the second pathogenic member discovered, after human parvovirus B19, of the subfamily Parvovirinae of the Parvoviridae (1). three additional HBoV variants have been detected in pediatric patients with acute gastroenteritis (2\u20134). the HBoVs belong to the genus Bocaparvovirus of the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-packaging Parvoviridae. the 5.5-kb linear genome is flanked by terminal hairpins and contains three open reading frames (ORFs) the proteins share a C terminus, while the N terminus of VP1 is unique (VP1u) HBoV1 assembled from VP2 monomers was determined by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and image reconstruction (cryoreconstruction) to a resolution of 7.9 (37) the HBoV1 capsid exhibited conserved features previously reported for other members of the subfamily Parvovirinae. the presence of depressions at the 2-fold axis of symmetry, protrusions surrounding the 3-fold axis of symmetry, id cryoreconstructed structure solved to a resolution of 7.9. image is radially depth cued as shown in the color key. arrows indicate the icosahedral symmetry axes and surface features. 80%, 48%, 10%, and 0%, respectively (9), respectively. HBoV1-infected children had preexisting HBoV2 or HBoV3 IgG. underestimation of proportion of individuals infected by more than one HBoV type. study to identify antigenic sites on the HBoV capsids of other human parvoviruses. information on the antigenic epitopes will guide the rational design and development of peptide vaccines that can be used to control HBoV1 to -4 infections. the infected cells were harvested 3 days postinfection by centrifugation. the cell pellet was resuspended in 7 ml of a lysis buffer, TNET. polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000 (1 g/10 ml) was added to the supernatant and stirred overnight. the pellet was resuspended in TNTM (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.2% Triton X-100) and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. multiple low-speed spins at 10,000 g at 4\u00b0C were carried out to remove large insoluble aggregates. four MAbs (4C2, 9G12, 12C1, and 15C6) were generated in mice using hybridoma technology. three female BALB/c mice were injected 3 times subcutaneously with 50 g of recombinant HBoV1 VLPs at 4-week intervals. the use of the BALB/c mice for the generation of the HBoV antibodies was approved by the Council of the Institute of Biotechnology, Vilnius University. the MAbs were purified from hybridoma growth medium by affinity chromatography on protein A Sepharose. samples were incubated with activated immobilized papain (Pierce) at a suggested enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:160 (wt/wt) at 37\u00b0C overnight in a rotating incubator. the sludge was loaded onto a Hi Trap protein A column (GE Healthcare) that captured the constant-region (Fc) portion of the digested antibody. the frozen grids were imaged using a 16-megapixel charge-coupled-device camera (Gatan, Inc.) micrographs for each data set were recorded at a magnification of approximately 82,500 on a camera with pixels of 15 m, resulting in a pixel size of 1.82. model method with at least 10% of the total number of boxed particle images and imposing icosahedral symmetry (50) resolutions of final reconstructed 3D maps were estimated based on an FSC threshold criterion of 0.5. noise suppression factor postrefinement in AUTO3DEM (50, 52) homology models of HBoV1 and HBoV4 were docked as rigid bodies into the respective cryoreconstructed density maps of HBoV1-4C2, HBoV1-9G12, HBoV1-12C1, HBoV1-15C6, HBoV2-15C6 and HBoV4-15C6 using the UCSF-Chimera program. the correlation coefficient (CC) was used as a criterion to measure the fit the HBoV capsids and docked Fab models were analyzed. the figures were generated using the PyMOL and UCSF-Chimera programs. polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000 (1 g/10 ml) was added to the supernatant. it was centrifuged at 12,100 g for 1 h at 4\u00b0C to harvest the precipitated VLPs. cell pellets were subjected to three rounds of freeze and thaw cycles. the clarified sample was loaded on top of a 10 to 40% (wt/vol) sucrose step gradient in TNTM and spun at 151,000 g for 3 h at 4\u00b0C. the VLP fraction was extracted from the 20 to 30% sucrose step by needle puncture of the gradient tube. spleen cells were fused with mouse myeloma Sp2/0 cells. the best-responder mouse was boosted with the same antigen dose. spleen cells were fused with mouse myeloma Sp2/0 cells. the membrane-containing samples were blocked in 5% nonfat milk (PBS with 0.2% Tween 20 [Sigma]) for 1 h. the membrane was then incubated separately with the four primary antibodies (1:5,000 dilution in PBS-T) for 1 h. protein A column (GE Healthcare) captured the constant-region (Fc) portion of the digested antibody. the fragment antibody-binding portions (Fabs) (25 kDa) were collected in the flowthrough from the column. aliquots of each HBoV-Fab complex, i.e., HBoV1-4C2, HBoV1-9G12, HBoV1-12C1, HBoV1-15C6, and HBoV4-15C6, were used. the frozen grids were imaged using a 16-megapixel charge-coupled-device (CCD) camera (Gatan, Inc.) in a Tecnai G2 F20-Twin the total number of boxed particles, defocus range, number of particles used in the final reconstruction are listed in Table 1. the total number of boxed particles, defocus range, number of particles used in the final reconstruction, and resolution of the final reconstruction are listed in Table 1. the correlation coefficient (CC) was used as a criterion to measure the fit. the pseudoatomic models of HBoV1, HBoV2, and HBoV4 were used to confirm the correct hand of the density map. the vop (volume of operation) zflip subroutine in UCSF-Chimera was used to correct the map hand when needed. the cryoreconstructed structures of HBoV1, HBoV2, and HBoV4 complexed with the Fab fragment of MAb 15C6 were determined to estimated resolutions of 18.6, 17.8, and 9.5, respectively. the HBoV-15C6 complex maps showed density corresponding to the bound 15C6 Fab localized. the density threshold of the capsid was observed at 3. that of the complementarity-determining region was observed at a 2 threshold. this suggests that the Fab occupancy is less than 1 (i.e., less than 5 per 5-fold axis) residues 29 to 542), HBoV2 (residues 26 to 538) and HBoV4 (residues 31 to 538) docked into the normalized cryoreconstructed density maps of their respective 15C6 complexes. CCs for the docked complex models were 0.90, 0.86, and 0.9 for HBoV1-15C6, HBoV2-15C6, and HBoV4 VR-VIIIB, the contact residues are 461-SNA-463, 457-NNA-459, and 460-NNA-462 in HBoV1, HBoV2 and HBoV4 respectively, from a 5-fold-symmetry-related VP monomer. this sequence is also 458-NNA-460 in HBoV3. the equivalent residues in the nonbinding HBoV3 are 82-NGGG-85. -VIIIB (HI loop; aa 461 to 463; wheat), while the Fab constant region interacts with residues within VR-I. the figure was generated using PyMOL (60). residues within the 15C6 footprint include 63 to 80, 80 to 95, 130 to 150, 172 to 197, and 453 to 468 in HBoV1. these and/or a single residue difference (T146V) in HBoV3 at the 15C6 contact may be responsible for its lack of recognition by the antibody. superposition of the HBoV1-4C2, HBoV1-12C1, and HBoV1-15C6 density maps showed that they overlap. the HBoV1 capsid features at the 2-fold and 5-fold axes in the complex structures were similar to that of the HBoV1 VLP-alone reconstruction (37). interface analysis in PDBePISA and manual inspection in the COOT program mapped the contact sites for the 4C2, 12C1 and 9G12 Fabs to residues within VR-I (80 to 85), VR-V (306 to 315 and 331 to 336) and VR-VI (354 to 356) of the reference monomer and VR-IV (283 to 288) and VR-VIII (388 to 395) of a 3-fold-symmetry-related monomer. footprint areas were calculated to arrows indicate the 2-, 3-, and 5-fold axes of symmetry on top of the HBoV1 capsid. cross-reactive epitope of 15C6 is localized to the DE and HI loops. the cross-reactive epitope of 15C6 is localized to the DE and HI loops. HBoV1 (residues 29 to 542), HBoV2 (residues 26 to 538) and HBoV4 (residues 31 to 538) docked into the normalized cryoreconstructed density maps of their respective 15C6 complexes. CCs for the docked complex models were 0.90, 0.86, and 0.9 for HBoV1-15C6, HBoV2-15C6, and VR-I residues making contact with the constant region are 81-NQSG-84, 81-NAGG-84, and 81-STSQ-84 of HBoV1, HBoV2 and HBoV4 respectively. the equivalent residues in the nonbinding HBoV3 are 82-NGGG-85. the equivalent residues in the nonbinding HBoV3 are 82-NGGG-85. DR interacts with residues within VR-II (top of DE loop; amino acids [aa] 141 to 146; blue) and symmetry-related VR-VIIIB (aa 80 to 85; purple) the Fab constant region interacts with residues within VR-I (aa 80 to 85; purple) HBoV2-15C6 and HBoV4-15C6 complexes bind to the 5-fold region of the capsid (61). adeno-associated virus serotype 5 (AAV5) also bind to the 5-fold region of the capsid (61). adeno-associated virus serotype 5 (AAV5) also bind to the 5-fold region of the capsid (61). the Fab densities for the three antibodies were located on or proximal to the protrusions surrounding the 3-fold axis of the capsid. superposition of the HBoV1-4C2, HBoV1-12C1, HBoV1-9G12, and HBoV1-15C6 density maps showed that they overlap. the HBoV1 capsid features at the 2-fold and 5-fold axes in the complex structures were similar to that of the interface analysis in PDBePISA and manual inspection in the COOT program mapped the contact sites for the 4C2, 12C1 and 9G12 Fabs to residues within VR-I (80 to 85), VR-V (306 to 315 and 331 to 336) and VR-VI (354 to 356) of the reference monomer and VR-IV (283 to 288) and VR-VIII (388 to 395) of a 3-fold-symmetry-related monomer. footprint areas were calculated to the figure was generated using the RIVEM program (82). DISCUSSION Due to reports of HBoV-associated severe to life-threatening illnesses and a lack of direct treatment or vaccination, there is limited understanding of the disease mechanisms. cross-reactive and strain-specific antigenic epitopes on the capsid overlap those of other members of the genus Bocaparvovirus. HBoV antigenic footprints overlap those of other members of the subfamily Parvovirinae. shown are capsid surface images of AMDV, B19, AAV2, HBoV1 and CPV colored in gray with antigenic VRs colored according to the color key provided. the figure was generated using the PyMOL program (60) if neutralizing, capsid binding by 15C6 MAb would block the PLA2 function of the VP1u region required for endosomal/lysosomal escape by the viruses. this loop represents a second potential peptide (in addition to the HI loop) for the design of another broadly neutralizing peptide vaccine to control HBoV1 to -4 infection. the antigenic-footprint information can be combined with knowledge of functional roles for analogous regions in other parvoviruses for the development of therapeutic vaccines. HBoV antigenic footprints overlap those of other Parvovirinae members. shown are capsid surface images of AMDV, B19, AAV2, HBoV1 and CPV colored in gray with antigenic VRs colored according to the color key provided. the figure was generated using the PyMOL program (60). of the overlapping parvovirus antigenic regions in B19, the epitope comprising residues 314 to 330 within VR-IV on the 3-fold protrusion is similar to the C37-B neutralizing antibody epitope in AAV2 that reactive 15C6 epitope is also part of the ADK1a, A20, ADK5b, and 521-D epitopes for AAV1, AAV2, AAV5, and B19. this loop thus serves as a potential target for the development of a peptide vaccine that would be broadly neutralizing against multiple HBoV strains. the antigenic-footprint information can be combined with knowledge of functional roles for analogous regions in other parvoviruses."}
