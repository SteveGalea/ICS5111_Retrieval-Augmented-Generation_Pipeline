{"summary": "HRVs were detected in 315 (16%) of 1919 hospitalized patients and 27 (9.6%) of 280 controls. children had the highest frequency of HRV detections. HRVs are a well established cause of the common cold, an upper respiratory illness characterized by rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, cough, sore throat and sneezing. some studies suggest that HRVs may be associated with more severe illness, including hospitalized lower respiratory disease and asthma exacerbations. a patient was eligible for enrollment if he/she had at least one sign of acute infection (e.g. fever, abnormal white blood cell count) and the physician ordered a chest radiograph within 48 hours of admission. each patient had a nasopharyngeal swab, acute and convalescent serum, and demographic information collected. nasopharyngeal specimens were tested for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs) 1, 2, and 3, influenza viruses A and B, adenovirus, Legionella species, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumonia, and rhinovirus/enterovirus. a positive culture, RT-PCR, or four-fold rise in serology serologic testing and PCR assays for Legionella sp., Chlamydia penumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were only performed on patients enrolled during the first study year, September 2003\u2013August 31, 2004. diagnostic testing included urine pneumococcal surface antigen assay among patients aged 18 years. 7449 patients with signs and symptoms of acute lower respiratory tract infection were admitted to hospital in Sa Kaeo province. 4347 (58%) of these patients had a chest radiograph ordered within 48 hours. those who were and were not enrolled had similar presenting signs and symptoms. the association between hospitalization and HRV detection was stratified by age group, evidence for effect modification by age. compared between hospitalization and HRV detections among hospitalized patient with lower respiratory tract infections, outpatients with influenza-like illness and controls\u00a3 without respiratory symptoms and fever. hospitalized enrolled patients from year two, sept 1, 2004\u2013Aug 31, 2005, were compared to controls. the number of hospitalized patients with HRV detection during year two was 1\u201311 months: 31/103 (30%), 1\u20134 years: 73/276 (26%), 5\u201319 years: 26/125 (21%), 20\u201349 years (24/212 (11%), 50\u201364 years: 21/156 (13%), 65 years: 23/302 (7.6%). co-detections included RSV, HMPV, HPIV 1\u20133, influenza type A or B, and adenovirus for all patients, and S. pneumoniae for adults aged 18 years. co-detections with other respiratory pathogens were common among all age groups, but most striking among young children. eight (6.8%) of 117 patients with HRV had co-detection of an atypical bacterial pathogen [27], one adult with L. longbeacheae, two patients with M. pneumoniae, and five patients with co-detection of Chlamydia pneumoniae. 7 (2.3%) were co-infected with RSV, 14 (4.6%) with HPIV 1, 2, or 3, 37 (12%) with influenza A or B, 14 (4.6%) with HMPV all three HRV species were identified from the 225 HRV-positive specimens from the control and hospitalized patients enrolled during the second year of the study. no statistically significant differences in the proportion of individual species between controls and hospitalized patients were found. we compared HRV detection among hospitalized enrolled patients and controls stratified into two groups, adult and children, due to possible effect modification by age. the association was 2-fold elevated among adults compared to controls.

During the first study year, co-detections included mycoplasma, Chlamydia, and Legionella for hospitalized adults. HRVs were detected during all months of the year among all enrolled ill patients, including outpatients with influenza-like illness and hospitalized enrolled patients with lower respiratory tract illness. some decrease in detections during the hot and dry months of April and may. both HRV-A and HRV-C detections were epidemiologically associated with hospitalized lower respiratory tract illness among children. the risk measurements were not statistically significant, likely due to small numbers after stratification by species. we estimated high rates of HRV detections among children 5 years of age. however, this age group also had a high frequency of HRV detections among young control children without respiratory symptoms or fever. however, our rates may not reflect the actual burden of HRV-associated illness among hospitalized pediatric patients. previously we reported co-detection of human bocavirus and coronaviruses with HRV during the second study year [32], [33] but did not include them in this analysis due to their uncertain association with hospitalized illness. our results support the identification, and probable exclusion, of infection with other known respiratory pathogens as important for evaluating illness possibly associated with HRV. enrolled in the outpatient setting with influenza-like illness. we present evidence for HRVs, and HRV-A and HRV-C, as pathogens associated with hospitalized lower respiratory tract illness."}
