{"summary": "2019 marks the 20th anniversary of the definitive description of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) as a unique cell type by the Liu and Colonna groups. this description was based on extensive prior research by multiple groups. the last 20 years produced extraordinary insights into all aspects of pDC biology, including their development, mechanism of activity, and role in the immune system. pDCs respond to these nucleic acids with massive secretion of IFN-I. pDCs also produce type III interferon (IFN- or IL-28/IL-29) and additional cytokines (e.g., TNF-) and chemokines. myeloid pathway to pDCs includes common dendritic cell (DC) progenitor (CDP) and pDC-biased DC progenitors. relative rarity and quiescence of pDC-committed lymphoid progenitors is not consistent with these cells being a major source of much more abundant pDCs. clonal tracing studies of transplanted or cultured progenitors suggest that the commitment to produce pDC and/or cDC subsets may be determined at early stages of differentiation. the fact that Flt3L alone is sufficient for pDC development suggests the existence of a robust transcriptional program that drives spontaneous pDC differentiation. the subsequent specification of pDCs requires the E protein transcription factor TCF4 (E2-2) the loss of MTG16 or of transcriptional repressor ZEB2 causes de-repression of ID2 and impairs pDC development. a milder reduction of TCF4 activity by the deletion of pDC-specific \u201clong\u201d isoform TCF4L (Grajkowska et al., 2017) reduces pDC development. however, the development of cDC1 is enhanced. deletion of TCF4 from mature pDCs induces the switch to dendritic morphology and expression of cDC gene signature. additional \u201cresolution\u201d between pDC and cDC expression programs is provided by transcription factor ETV6, which represses the cDC gene signature in pDCs and vice versa. the IFN-I-producing capacity of pDCs is dependent on interferon response family (IRF) transcription factors including IRF7 (Honda et al., 2005b), IRF5 (Dai et al., 2011, Yasuda et al., 2011), and IRF8 (Sichien et al., 2016). pDC-enriched epigenetic regulator CXXC5 together with DNA demethylase Tet2 results suggest existence of a \u201cnon-canonical\u201d DC population that is intermediate between the canonical pDCs and cDCs. these cells manifest the surface phenotype and functionality of cDCs, lack IFN-I production, yet have a transcriptional profile related to pDCs and require TCF4 for development. this proposed cross-species alignment of DCs is supported by high-dimensional DC phenotyping in humans and mice. the developmental origin and function of non-canonical subsets need to be elucidated in both species. pDC heterogeneity is evident from the expression of surface markers such as murine CD4, CD8 or Ccr2. pDC activation results in massive pDC apoptosis caused by IFN-I. in vitro activated human pDCs generate distinct populations with preferential IFN-producing or antigen-presenting capacities. however, pre-existing commitment toward these fates within the pDC population cannot be ruled out. non-endosomal MyD88-dependent TLRs such as TLR2 may also be functional in pDCs in response to certain stimuli. intracellular sensing pathways such as cGAS/STING and MDA5/MAVS may restrict IFN-I response of pDCs. pDCs express high levels of IRF7 and therefore were proposed to secrete IFN-I rapidly and independently of the IFNAR-based feedback signaling. pDCs express high levels of IRF7 and therefore were dispensable for pDC response to viruses such as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) s manifested normal response to MCMV despite low baseline levels of IRF7. IFNAR appears necessary for full-strength IFN-I response to TLR ligands in vivo. but full pDC functionality still requires intact IFNAR signaling. the contribution of LFA-1 expressed on pDCs to IFN-I production in response to MCMV and to the influenza virus has been recently confirmed in vivo. the unique IFN-I-producing capacity of pDCs cannot be easily explained by any single known mechanism or molecule. however, it appears to integrate multiple pathways and cellular processes. s are transferred from infected cells (highlighted in dark gray) to pDCs during polarized contact via exosomes or viral particles. some of these act through broadly expressed surface receptors such as CXCR4 and CD44, which inhibit pDC activation in response to natural monoamines. others seem to be \u201cre-purposed\u201d for inhibitory function in pDCs. pDCs lack an obvious ortholog of ILT-7 but express Bst2. the species-specific nature of above-mentioned inhibitory pathways likely reflects separate evolutionary pressures from pathogens. the deletion or ligation of PTPRS enhanced or inhibited pDC activation. pDCs pDCs were defined by their ability to respond to the purified influenza virus added to cultures. it is consistent with the relative resistance of pDCs to infection by many viruses to which they are capable of responding with IFN-I production. replication-active and productive infection of pDCs by IFN-I-inducing viruses has been described in vitro. autophagy may represent one mechanism where a virus replicating inside the pDC would get access to the endosomal compartment and induce IFN-I production. pDCs spontaneously \u201cdivide the labor\u201d\u2014some get infected and others recognize the virus replicating in the infected pDCs. pDCs produce IFN-I by interacting with and recognizing HCV-infected hepatocytes rather than the free HCV. this recognition is TLR7 dependent, requires physical contact between pDCs and live infected cells. this phenomenon was initially proposed to occur via the short-range transfer of viral RNA in exosomes. the recognition of virus-infected cells by pDCs has multiple potential advantages. first, it helps pDCs detect the virus during the main intracellular events of its life cycle. the recognition of a free virus such as VSV appears less efficient than the recognition of cells infected with the same virus. recent histological analysis of IFN-I-producing pDCs during MCMV infection suggests that they are indeed localized in proximity to virus-infected cells. role of pDC-mediated adhesion in the process would be consistent with the analysis of homotypic pDC interactions. these results may reflect the notoriously multilayered nature of immune responses. conventional DC were shown to compensate for the absence of pDCs in infections with ectromelia virus (Kaminsky et al., 2015) or MCMV (Puttur et al., 2016) depletion incomplete on C57BL/6 background Cisse et al., 2008, Cervantes-Barragan et al., 2012 Tcf4 (E2-2) monoallelic germline deletion constitutive functional impairment of pDCs. effects in non-pDCs formally possible Allman et al., 2006, Guillerey et al., 2012 CLEC4C (BDCA-2) human transgene driving DTR DT-inducible de mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) causes acute infection that is normally controlled in a TLR7- and IFNAR-dependent manner. pDCs produce nearly all detectable IFN-I within 8\u201312 h. pDCs are sufficient to control acute infection with dengue and chikungunya viruses. pDC production appears critical for protection against cytopathic effects of the virus, NK cell activation, amplification of cytokine response, and overall innate control of viral replication. pDCs also play a key role in shaping adaptive responses to viruses. pDCs contribute to IFN-I response and control of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in the lung. pDCs dampen RSV-induced Th2 cell responses, lung inflammation, and asthma. the role of pDCs in human persistent viral infections has been studied. elucidating these mechanisms represents an important challenge for years to come. pDC activity has been implicated in almost every autoimmune or inflammatory disease. genetic ablation of pDCs revealed only a mild stage-specific role of pDCs in a genetic model of psoriasis. s was shown to ameliorate insulitis and significantly reduce incidence of diabetes in NOD mice. patients manifest elevated expression of multiple ISGs. pathogenic immune complexes induce IFN-I production in pDCs. pDCs from SSc patients produce high levels of proinflammatory hemokine. pDCs are required not only for inflammation triggered by immune complexes, but also for the production of autoantibodies. this emerging role of pDCs in both innate and adaptive immune responses to self is reminiscent of their dual role in antiviral responses. pDCs are required not only for inflammation triggered by immune complexes, but also for the production of autoantibodies. the proposed major sensor of self-DNA in pDCs appears to have a net tolerogenic activity in experimental SLE. pDCs act primarily through IFN-I secretion (local or systemic), the production of other soluble mediators such as IL-6 (Jego et al., 2003), or other functions such as antigen presentation. the former possibility is supported by studies in human cells in vitro. studies in cancer patients showed a profoundly aberrant and/or hypofunctional state of tumor-infiltrating pDCs. pDCs in breast and ovarian tumors produce IFN-I poorly yet have an increased capacity to induce Treg cell differentiation. the role of TGF- and the tumor-promoting properties of pDCs have been recently supported by genetic pDC depletion in mice. the field seems to be crossing the \u201cbottleneck\u201d toward translation of the basic knowledge into clinically relevant applications. for example, the study of pDC development helped elucidate a highly aggressive leukemia type, the blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) from its initial identification as the leukemic counterpart of pDCs. pDCs have the round morphology of a secretory lymphocyte and express low levels of MHC class II that can be upregulated upon activation. pDCs respond to these nucleic acids with massive secretion of IFN-I, which commences within 1\u20133 h. pDCs produce type III interferon (IFN- or IL-28/IL-29) and additional cytokines (e.g., TNF-) and chemokines. pDCs are continuously produced in the bone marrow (BM) pDCs emerge as mature cells into the periphery, where they remain non-proliferative and have a relatively short lifespan of several days. eloid pathway to pDCs includes a potential common dendritic cell (DC) progenitor (CDP) and pDC-biased DC progenitors. relative rarity and quiescence of pDC-committed lymphoid progenitors is not consistent with these cells being a major source of much more abundant pDCs. the commitment to produce pDC and/or cDC subsets may be determined at early stages of differentiation. the fact that Flt3L alone is sufficient for pDC development suggests the existence of a robust transcriptional program that drives spontaneous pDC differentiation. the subsequent specification of pDCs requires the E protein transcription factor TCF4 (E2-2) a milder reduction of TCF4 activity by the deletion of pDC-specific \u201clong\u201d isoform TCF4L reduces pDC development. TCF4 is a close homolog of other E protein transcription factors TCF3 (E2A) and TCF12 (HEB), the key regulators of lymphocyte development. transcription factor ETV6, which represses the cDC gene signature in pDCs, cDCs, or all DCs, is shown in red, blue, or violet. pDCs undergo an elaborate differentiation program that ensures their functionality in the periphery. pDC-enriched epigenetic regulator CXXC5 and DNA demethylase Tet2 were shown to promote Irf7 expression by maintaining the hypomethylation of its promoter in pDC. these studies begin to reveal a complex transcriptional network that maintains the capacity of pDCs for rapid response while limiting unwanted hyperactivation. non-canonical pDCs and cDCs co-express TCF4 and ID2, consistent with their intermediate position between TCF4hi pDCs and ID2hi cDCs. this proposed cross-species alignment of DCs is supported by high-dimensional DC phenotyping in humans and mice. canonical pDCs and cDCs (including cDC1 and cDC2) and intermediate \u201cnon-canonical\u201d populations (nc-pDCs) shown are functional properties including the IFN-I production capacity and antigen presentation capacity in the steady state. in vitro activated human pDCs generate distinct populations with preferential IFN-producing or antigen-presenting capacities. differentiation into cDC-like cells represents intrinsic property of activated pDCs. intracellular sensing pathways such as cGAS/STING and MDA5/MAVS may restrict IFN-I response of pDCs. the expression of TLR7 and TLR9 is a distinct but not unique property that is shared with B cells and several myeloid cell types. pDCs express high levels of IRF7 and therefore were proposed to secrete IFN-I rapidly and independently of the IFNAR-based feedback signaling. pDCs manifest normal response to MCMV despite low baseline levels of IRF7 (Tomasello et al., 2018). pDCs express high levels of IRF7. pDC signaling does not require high IRF7 levels and may promote pDC responses to certain viruses. pDC form tight clusters within hours of activation by TLR ligands in vivo. pDC response to TLR ligands and to the influenza virus is impaired. the unique IFN-I-producing capacity of pDCs cannot be explained by any single known mechanism or molecule. the unique IFN-I-producing capacity of pDCs cannot be easily explained by any single known mechanism or molecule. y mechanisms act through broadly expressed surface receptors such as CXCR4 and CD44, which inhibit pDC activation in response to natural monoamines. other receptors are relatively specific for pDCs, such as murine SiglecH and human BDCA-2 (CD303) and ILT-7 (CD85). ILT-7 is an immunoglobulin-like receptor whose single known ligand is BST2 (tetherin), an interferon-inducible antiviral membrane protein that may provide a negative feedback signal to IFN-I-producing pDC. the species-specific nature of above-mentioned inhibitory pathways likely reflects separate evolutionary pressures from pathogens. global or dendritic cell-specific deletion of PTPRS/PTPRF in mouse caused spontaneous IFN-I production and colitis. negative regulation of pDC responses appears fundamental to pDC biology. further analysis of these pathways may provide attractive opportunities for therapeutic targeting of pDC activation. autophagy may represent one mechanism where a virus replicating inside the pDC would get access to the endosomal compartment and induce IFN-I production. pDCs spontaneously \u201cdivide the labor\u201d\u2014some get infected and others recognize the virus replicating in the infected pDCs. this new paradigm of virus recognition by pDCs was introduced in a study of hepatitis C virus (HCV), an RNA virus with a strict tropism RNA of a replicating virus may be transferred between infected cells and pDCs within immature viral particles or enveloped virions. in cells latently infected with the DNA herpesvirus Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), EBV-derived RNA can be transferred to pDCs through exosomes. this phenomenon was also observed in murine and porcine pDCs. pDCs are resistant to multiple evasion mechanisms used by viruses to prevent recognition and IFN-I secretion by the infected cell. in this scenario, infected pDCs may elicit TLR-driven production of IFN-I from uninfected pDCs. the role of LFA-1-mediated adhesion in the process would be consistent with the analysis of homotypic pDC interactions. these and other data support the formation of integrin-mediated \u201cinterferogenic synapse\u201d between the infected cell and a pDC, as proposed in a recently deposited study. the role of pDCs has to be rigorously assessed by genetic ablation. the role of pDCs must be rigorously assessed by genetic ablation. pDCs play a major non-redundant role in viral infections. monoallelic germline deletion constitutive functional impairment of pDCs; single allele partial reduction of pDC numbers and functionality; effects in non-pDCs formally possible Allman et al., 2006, Guillerey et al., 2012 CLEC4C (BDCA-2) human transgene driving DTR DT-inducible depletion; efficient; repeated DT injections used for several weeks; single allele transient. body-Mediated (Human, Primate) IL-3R (CD123) depleting mAb (clone CSL362) efficient depletion depletes other CD123+ cells (e.g., basophils); blocks IL-3 signaling Oon et al., 2016 CLEC4C (BDCA-2, CD303) agonistic mAb (clone 24F4A) specific. pDCs contribute to cytopathic effects of the virus, NK cell activation, amplification of cytokine response, and overall innate control of viral replication. pDCs play a key role in shaping adaptive responses to viruses. pDCs also play a key role in shaping the adaptive responses to viruses. pDCs dampen RSV-induced Th2 cell responses, lung inflammation, and asthma. persistent viruses such as LCMV impair the IFN-I producing capacity of pDCs. pDCs mount vigorous IFN-I response that is protective at early stages. genetic ablation of pDCs revealed only a mild stage-specific role of pDCs in a genetic model of psoriasis. genetic impairment of pDCs had no effect in two genetic models of colitis and exacerbated the disease in an antibody-mediated model of arthritis. recent genetic studies strongly support the pathogenic role of pDCs in several autoimmune diseases. pathogenic immune complexes induce IFN-I production in pDCs. pDCs from SSc patients produce high levels of proinflammatory hemokine CXCL4. transient pDC depletion could prevent and even revert skin fibrosis. female pDCs have higher IFN-I-producing capacity than male pDCs. this is due to both cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic factors. a constitutive impairment of pDCs by monoallelic deletion of Tcf4 strongly reduced autoantibody production. pDCs in neonates have a significantly reduced capacity to produce IFN-I in response to viruses such as RSV (Cormier et al., 2014), and rhinovirus (Barlow-Anacker et al., 2017). this reduced pDC function may contribute to increased susceptibility to infections in neonates and in particular may underline the ability of RSV to promote lung inflammation and asthma later in life. studies in cancer patients showed a profoundly aberrant and/or hypofunctional state of tumor-infiltrating pDCs. pDCs in breast and ovarian tumors produce IFN-I poorly yet have an increased capacity to induce Treg cell differentiation. the role of TGF- and the tumor-promoting properties of pDCs have been recently supported by genetic pDC depletion in mice. DC development helped elucidate a highly aggressive leukemia type, the blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN), from its initial identification as the leukemic counterpart of pDCs. the analysis of pDC function led to the development of antibodies that deplete pDCs or inhibit their function. further dissection of pDC regulation should facilitate the development of non-depleting reagents to modulate pDC function in the"}
