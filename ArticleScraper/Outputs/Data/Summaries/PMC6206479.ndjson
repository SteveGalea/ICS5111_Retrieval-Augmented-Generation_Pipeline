{"summary": "virus infections often target the polarized epithelial cells lining the respiratory tract, digestive tract, or mucosal surfaces. some viruses target their proteins to the lumen via the apical or basolateral plasma membrane. other viruses target their proteins to the basolateral plasma membrane. the membrane-distal region of the cytoplasmic tail has been shown to be critical for the incorporation of vRNPs into budding particles (15\u201317, 24, 25) the membrane-proximal region of M2 can induce membrane curvature and has been implicated in ESCRT-independent membrane scission and budding of IAV particles. the stable cell lines were characterized for surface and total M2 expression by flow cytometry using the anti-M2 monoclonal antibody 14C2 either before or after membrane permeabilization. wild-type (WT) M2, M2-FLAG, M2-Baso, and M2-ER express approximately the same amount of total M2. stably transfected cells allowed for the replication of rUdorn/72(H3N2) (rUdorn/72(H3N2) (rUdorn/72(H3N2)) M2-Baso-expressing cells allowed for a significantly decreased amount of infectious virus particle production. eGFP-expressing cells are unable to support virus replication above the limit of detection. recombinant rWSN/33 (H1N1) (rWSN) M2-Stop virus was used. rWSN M2-, M2-FLAG-, and M2-Baso-expressing cells all supported similar levels of infectious virus particle production. however, all cell lines supported similar levels of rUdorn WT and rWSN WT infectious virus production. no nonspecific detrimental replication defects associated with expressing M2 on the ER or basolateral plasma membrane. rUdorn M2-Stop (A), rUdorn (B), rWSN M2-stop (C) and rWSN (D) endpoint dilution results on the indicated MDCK II cell lines. rVic M2-ER and rVic M2-Baso were unable to replicate to appreciable levels. rVic M2-Baso replicated to lower peak titers and with slower kinetics. but the effect of targeting M2 to the basolateral membrane was not as detrimental to virus replication as targeting it to the ER. rVic M2-FLAG replicates to a higher titer than rVic WT during high-MOI infections on hNECs. infectious particles and viral proteins were never detected in the basolateral chamber of hNECs infected with rVic WT, rVic M2-FLAG, or rVic M2-Baso. the levels of cell-associated M1 protein were equal to or higher than those in rVic hpi virus titers in apical (A) and basolateral (B) chambers were determined. data are pooled from three independent replicates. n = 3 wells in each replicate. high-MOI infections were performed with the indicated viruses. cells (A) and apical supernatant (B) were assessed by RT-qPCR. rVic M2-Baso replication and cell polarization were assessed. rVic M2-Baso replicates more efficiently in cells with a TER reading of 650 cm2 or greater. this may be because the localization of the M2-Baso protein is not as restricted under conditions of reduced cell polarization. high-MOI infections performed with the indicated viruses for 24 h. TER was measured before infection. rUdorn M2-Stop replicates to a significantly lower titer than rUdorn WT virus in MDCK cells. rUdorn M2-Stop replicates to a significantly lower titer than rUdorn WT virus in MDCK cells. amounts of HA2, NP, and M1 are reduced compared to rUdorn WT. there was very little viral M segment RNA detected in the supernatant of rVic M2-ER-infected cells. there was also a significant reduction in rUdorn M2-Stop packaging of viral M RNA. infected cells (A and C) and supernatant (B and D) were assessed by RT-qPCR. rVic M2-ER has significantly lower release of viral proteins than rUdorn M2-stop, suggesting mislocalizing M2 to the endoplasmic reticulum has a stronger effect on virus particle release than deleting the protein completely. confocal microscopy images of MDCK II cells stably expressing the indicated M2 construct and immunostained for the indicated proteins. n = 4 to 7 stably transfected cell lines. the ER was stained with an anti-calnexin antibody. then colocalization of M2 and calnexin was determined. M2-ER exhibits significantly increased ER colocalization compared to WT M2. MDCK II cells expressing WT M2, M2-FLAG, and M2-Baso all were able to replicate rUdorn M2-Stop to approximately 1 108 TCID50/ml by 24 to 36 h postinfection. the M2-Baso-expressing cells showed slightly slower kinetics of virus production and a later time of peak virus production. rUdorn M2-Stop (E) and rUdorn (F) multistep growth curves performed on MDCK II cells stably expressing the indicated proteins. infectious virus titers were determined on MDCK-M2 cells. data are representative of two independent replicates. data are pooled from two independent replicates for n = 6 to 7 wells. rVic M2-ER and rVic M2-Baso were unable to replicate to appreciable levels. rVic M2-FLAG replicates to significantly lower titers than rVic WT. the levels of cell-associated M1 protein were equal to or higher than those in rVic M2 Baso-infected cells compared to either rVic WT or rVic M2-FLAG. in the apical supernatant, all three viruses had equivalent levels of HA2 and M1 (Fig. 4C, G, and I) but the amount of NP secreted from rVic M2-Baso-infected cells was significantly reduced NP quantification for cells (E) and apical supernatant (H) data are pooled from two or three independent replicates. n = 3 wells in each replicate. phenotype of reduced NP incorporation and reduced overall virus infectivity is consistent with mutations in the membrane-distal portion of the M2 cytoplasmic tail (15, 17, 25) rVic WT and rVic M2-FLAG replicated to equivalent levels in hNEC cultures with low or high TER levels. similar amounts of infectious virus were detected in cells with a TER reading greater than 650 cm2 or cells with a TER reading less than 650 cm2. rVic M2-Baso replicates less efficiently in hNEC cultures with high TER readings than in cultures with low TER readings. er at 24 hpi (MOI of 1) was quantified using a linear regression model. n = 15 per virus pooled from two independent experiments. high-MOI infection and protein analysis of rVic M2-ER in MDCK cells. infected cells were lysed and analyzed with antibodies against HA2, NP, and M1. rUdorn M2-Stop replicates to a significantly lower titer than rUdorn WT virus in MDCK cells. high-MOI infections were performed with either rVic M2-ER (A and B) or rVic M2-Stop (C and D), and infected cells (A and C) and supernatant (B and D) were assessed by RT-qPCR for relative expression of the virus M gene segment. vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein loses its strict targeting to the basolateral plasma membrane. virus budding still occurs at the apical plasma membrane without a drastic decrease in virus replication (38\u201340) rUdorn expressing WT M2 infects MDCK II cells stably transfected with rVic M2-Baso and hNECs. phenotype penetrates more strongly when M2-Baso is expressed by the recombinant virus rather than the cells being infected. only a small amount of M2 is required to complement infection of an M2-stop virus (25) rVic M2-Baso replicates to significantly lower titers on highly polarized hNEC cultures than poorly polarized hNEC cultures. rVic M2-Baso replicates to significantly lower titers on highly polarized hNEC cultures than poorly polarized hNEC cultures. rVic M2-Baso has significantly reduced levels of infectious virus. in vivo epithelial cells and hNECs produce mucus that can interact with IAV particles. this inactivated virus may still be present at these time points. but this inactivated virus may still be present at these time points. targeting M2 away from the apical plasma membrane may disrupt any number of virus and cellular protein interactions critical for influenza virus assembly, budding, and replication. targeting M2 to the ER causes a defect in budding and replication, but relocalizing it to the ER. plasmid pCAGGS (pC) (65) expressing the cDNA for the M2 protein from A/Udorn/72(H3N2) (rUdorn) was described previously (25, 66) and was used as the starting material for all mutagenesis and subsequent establishment of cell lines stably expressing M2 proteins. the pCAGGS plasmid expressing the M2 protein from A/Udorn/72 (H3N2) were cultured as described for MDCK cells. the medium was supplemented with 5 M amantadine hydrochloride and 7.5 g/ml puromycin dihydrochloride (25) this MDCK subclone is routinely used for studies of polarized transport of proteins. the antibody that recognizes NP is a rabbit pAb (GTX125989;
