{"summary": "in 2005, china implemented a demonstration program known as \u201c686\u201d to scale-up nation-wide basic mental health services. teams \u201cunlocked\u201d and provided continuous mental health care to people with severe mental disorders who were found in restraints and largely untreated in their family homes. the 686 Program prioritized equal access to a basic package of community based mental health care for patients with severe mental illness, especially for those living in poverty. by 2005, 60 demonstration sites had been established, two in each of china\u2019s 30 provinces, covering 43 million people in \u201c686\u201d catchment areas. by the end of 2009, 96.88 million people from the general population in 112 cities were covered by this program, a total of 161,800 patients (0.17% of the general population) were despite such reports, we find no report of empirical studies of the long-term effectiveness of programs designed to \u201cunlock\u201d the patients and provide mental health services in such settings. the study aims to measure the long-term effects of an \u201cunlocking and treatment\u201d intervention undertaken from 2005 in context of a larger mental health services reform program in China. participants and data collection designed a nation-wide two-stage follow-up study to investigate the initial phases of the 686 Program \u201cunlocking and treatment\u201d intervention. participants met diagnostic criteria for Schizophrenia, Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Disorder, Delusional Disorder, Mental Retardation with psychotic symptoms, or Schizophrenia-like Psychosis in Epilepsy. key investigators from each province were trained to collect patient clinical data concerning T0, T1 and T2 from existing medical records routinely recorded by clinical staff for each unlocked patient. key investigators were trained to interview family members in their homes during Stage One (concerning T0 and T1) studies to collect data about locking and relocking history. s, psychiatric nurses, lay health care providers and non-health workers made up multidisciplinary teams to provide mental health services and non-professional services. psychiatric symptoms were assessed with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and global severity was assessed with clinical global impression scales. level 3 and above is regarded as cases with high violence. level 3 and above is regarded as cases with high violence. \"good adherence\" defined as patients actively take medications as prescribed. family members were asked to rate subjective experiences on analogue scales from 0 \u201cno impact at all\u201d to 10 \u201cextremely negative impact\u201d for the five categories of family burden. ratings concerning T0 were obtained by families\u2019 retrospective reflections at 2009 stage one study. relocking rate Patients remaining free of restraints after receiving \u201c686\u201d unlocking and treatment intervention was considered a sign of success of the program. 686 program unlocked 271 patients in demonstration sites across 26 provinces of china. 230 of these patients and families were followed-up in Stage two of the study. key investigators from each province were trained to collect patient clinical data concerning T0, T1 and T2 from existing medical records routinely recorded by clinical staff for each unlocked patient. key investigators were trained to interview family members in their homes during Stage One (concerning T0 and T1) studies to collect data about the locking and relocking history. health education and psychosocial support were also provided to patients and their family members during follow-up visits at community health centers or village clinics. psychiatrists, psychiatric nurses, lay health care providers and non-health workers made up multidisciplinary teams to provide mental health services. level 3 and above is regarded as cases with high violence. in the 686 Program, level 3 and above is regarded as cases with high violence. adherence Adherence with antipsychotic medication over the previous month was rated. the relocking rate was defined as the proportion of patients who were relocked after the initial \u201cunlocking and treatment\u201d intervention. mental health status, diagnoses, and violent behaviors were assessed with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) \"good adherence\" defined as patients actively take medications as prescribed. \"does not use medications\" defined as patients who did not receive antipsychotic medications for longer than two weeks. social functioning Assessments of social functioning include five categories. the level of statistical significance was defined as a two-sided p-value of 0.05 or less. as 36 (14%) cases dropped out of the study at T2, data from 230 (86%) cases were used in the statistical analysis and related comparisons at T2. total time of restraint varied from two weeks to 28 years. 94% of patients exhibited serious violent behaviors, at level 3 or above on the 686 Program\u2019s violent behavior scale [19]. 233 patients (88%) were admitted to a psychiatric hospital for professional treatment; 33 patients (12%) were immediately enrolled in \u201c686\u201d community outpatient programs. changes in patient medication adherence and social

at 2009 stage one study. 21 (8%) of the initial 266 individuals had an episode of \u201crelocking\u201d following the \u201c686\u201d intervening efforts. poor adherence to treatment, including \u201cuses antipsychotics intermittently\u201d was found at T2 in 12 (57%) cases who were relocked. family caregivers described significant reduction in feelings of stigma, psychological pressures, economic burden, loss of personal energy, and negative personal relationships at both T1 and T2. families became accustomed to the initial impact of the initiative on patients\u2019 clinical condition, and thus their ratings were biased toward minimizing the initial improvement at T2. people with severe mental illness worldwide live in \"zones of abandonment\" a combination of lack of medical care, outbursts of violence inside the household or a tendency to wander outside the house, stigma and embarrassment, and lack of ability of families to provide care lead to seclusion and restraints. this phenomenon represents human rights violations of individuals with mental and psychosocial disabilities. the patients registered at the initial phase of the 686 Program were 0.17% of the general population. 0.2% of all those registered were found to be in restraints. it is hoped that those who remain in restraints at home can be fully identified. more than 92% of those unlocked and entered into continuous treatment by the 686 Program remained free of restraints by 2012. the failure to prevent relocking for 21 individuals suggests considerable room for improvement of our mental health care practice still exists. stigma and embarrassment, and lack of ability of families to provide care lead to seclusion and restraints [24]. this phenomenon represents human rights violations of individuals with mental and psychosocial disabilities [15\u201318,25\u201327]. policies and laws should be well formulated to stimulate advocacy and education campaigns. 686 program to cover the whole population of patients with severe mental disorders. it is hoped that those who remain in restraints at home can be fully identified. the success of the program in maintaining the severely ill individuals in treatment over three to seven years attests to the feasibility and social value of the model."}
