{"summary": "ligands by exponential enrichment against Core Mature Core consists of two distinct domains: the N terminal domain 1 (D1, 124 residues), which is highly basic and binds RNA. the hydrophobic C terminal domain 2 (D2, 50 residues) which possesses a membrane binding region. in vitro D1 is sufficient to form stable proteinase-resistant nucleocapsids when stabilised by interactions with nucleic acids. SELEX is an established process for the in vitro isolation of high-affinity aptamers. in vitro selected nucleic acid molecules which bind with high affinity and specificity to their target17,18. each aptamer within a randomised library possesses a unique tertiary structure. peaks occurring within 10 nucleotides of statistically significant peaks in at least 60% of the representative set of HCV genomes analysed here are marked by a green arrow. similarity analysis revealed the potential formation of stem-loops with similar loop motifs in each of these fragments. the positions of stem-loops with this motif across the JFH-1 genome are displayed in Fig. 3b. a dominant GRRGR motif, R denoting a purine, is shown as a suite of red lollipops. eight stem-loops were selected for mutagenesis, three of which contained the highly conserved motif. remaining five stem-loops contained the lower-affinity GXRXR motif identified above. the stem-loops are numbered according to the first paired nucleotide within the context of the JFH-1 genome. multiple silent mutations were incorporated into the pJFH-1 plasmid to disrupt the pPSs. the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 nucleotides of the structures displayed from Fig. 4 are underlined in bold in the wildtype (upper) sequences. on occasion additional nucleotides flanking these regions were mutated to maximise disruption potential. in vitro transcribed RNA was electroporated into nave Huh-7 cells. at 4 and 48 h.p.e., RNA was extracted and quantified through qRT-PCR. data represents mean + SEM from three independent experiments. 48 h.p.e., virus-containing supernatant and PBS lysates from electroporated cells were titrated upon nave cells to determine the released and intracellular viral titres. intracellular and released virus titres were also calculated for 8XSL and wildtype JFH-1 at multiple time points following electroporation. RNA secondary structure appears altered in subgenomic fragments containing disrupted pPSs. mutant genome unable to form such structures displays impaired viral infectivity whilst RNA replication is unaffected. core consists of two distinct domains: the N terminal domain 1 (D1, 124 residues), which is highly basic and binds RNA. hydrophobic C terminal domain 2 (D2, 50 residues) which possesses a membrane binding region. in vitro D1 is sufficient to form stable proteinase-resistant nucleocapsids when stabilised. serum albumin was used for SELEX with a 2\u2032OH RNA aptamer library. in vitro selected nucleic acid molecules which bind with high affinity to target17,18. each aptamer within a randomised library possesses a unique tertiary structure, depending on the series of stems, pseudoknots, kinks and/or bulges. the same procedure was applied to an additional 14 genotype 2 HCV genomes, i.e. they were compared to the unselected nave library. this suggests that these PS sites are evolutionarily conserved. such peaks within 10 nucleotides of the peaks in Fig. 2 are highlighted by green arrows. this confirmed a significant statistical bias in the wild-type genomes for this motif. we then interrogated sub-motifs of GRRGR in order to identify those with even higher statistical significance. positions of stem-loops with this motif across the JFH-1 genome are shown as a suite of red lollipops. encoding NS5B was avoided as numerous studies have reported the existence of essential structures required for RNA replication. mutations in this region would render the virus replication-defective23,24. eight stem-loops were selected for mutagenesis, three of which contained the predicted highly conserved motif. all 57 silent mutations were combined into a single viral genome. pPS mutants encoding all 8 single pPS mutant viruses were electroporated into Huh-7 cells. RNA replication and translation are unaffected in viral genomes containing disrupted pPSs. in vitro transcribed RNA was electroporated into nave Huh-7 cells. at 4 and 48 h.p.e., cells were lysed in Glasgow lysis buffer. virus-containing supernatant and PBS lysates from electroporated cells were titrated upon nave cells to determine the released and intracellular viral titres. RNA secondary structures are altered within the packaging signal mutants to confirm that the introduced mutations caused structural alterations. a high SHAPE reactivity is indicative of a flexible nucleotide. only the terminal loop of a prototype stem-loop structure would appear as \u201creactive\u201d nucleotides. pPSs may form in the presence of an RNA chaperone such as Core or NS5A. a mutant genome unable to form such structures displays impaired viral infectivity whilst RNA replication is unaffected. the synergistic effect of these individual interactions may ensure encapsidation of a single viral genome occurs during virion assembly, thereby preventing non-specific packaging of cellular RNAs. the presence of multiple, weak-affinity packaging signals in other RNA virus genomes has recently been reported. pPSs presumably also exist which were not mutated in this analysis. previous models of assembly which utilise multiple contributing packaging signals predict capsid assembly occurs in the presence of one higher-affinity RNA structure. initial binding of this motif to the structural protein then instigates additional multimerisation and concurrent interactions with the lower-affinity packaging signals. RNA binding spectrum35 and interacts specifically with Core protein36. this combined with the fact that Core exhibits extensive RNA chaperone activity37,38 suggests a highly plausible model of RNA conformational alterations occurring during RNA transfer and subsequent assembly. the preferred core-RNA binding motif is the IIId loop and this interaction inhibits IRES-mediated translation40,44. the presence of the NS2 protein improves the production of replicon-containing particles. this was most apparent when NS2 is expressed in cis (within the replication-cassette), rather than in trans (within the structural protein construct)49. however, the fact that the pPS SL2899 is present upon this particular replicon may increase the efficiency of packaging. Recombinant protein expression Core (D1) of JFH-1 was cloned into the pET28B(+) construct (Novagen), in-frame with a N-terminal hexahistidine tag. soluble fraction was filtered (0.45 m) before being loaded on to an equilibrated Ni2+ Sepharose resin column. protein was dialysed overnight into PBS and quantified by spectrometry. SDS-PAGE was conducted upon both bacterial lysates and eluted protein fractions according to previously described methods55. OH RNA library was synthesised according to an experimentally and iteratively optimised protocol. it was purchased from AptaIT (Munich, Germany) who performed three rounds of synthesis, Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) and statistical analysis of NGS data from the library using the COMPAS software. the random region of the library has been optimised in respect of an equal distribution of nucleotide building blocks. the final selected aptamer library contained 112,117 unique sequences. each aptamer sequence was slid along the genome in increments of 1 nucleotide. each aptamer sequence was slid along the genome in increments of 1 nucleotide. consensus motif was GRRGR; this motif was 2.05 times more likely to occur in the wildtype than randomised genomes. pPSs with the former motif could correspond to high affinity PSs, and those with the latter motif could correspond to lower affinity PSs. genome of all mutant viruses was confirmed through mutagenesis. linearised DNA was used as a template for in vitro transcription. RNA transcripts were purified using silica-gel columns. quantified by absorbance at 260 nm prior to transfection into mammalian cells. intracellular virus was isolated by 5 repeated freeze-thaw cycles of lysates. lysates were clarified at 2000 g for 2 minutes before protein concentration was determined by BCA assay. RNA mapping by selective 2\u2032 hydroxy acylation analysed by primer extension (SHAPE) was cloned into pCRBlunt after PCR amplification from both pJFH-1 and 8XSL plasmid templates. mutant insert therefore contained 19 silent point mutations ablating predicted structures of SL5877 and SL6067. subgenomic in vitro transcripts were then synthesised from a T7 promoter located upstream of the Luria broth media (1% glucose) was inoculated with a 1:1000 dilution of starter culture and maintained at 37 \u00b0C until an OD600 of 0.6\u20130.8 was reached. protein expression was then induced by the addition of 100 mM isopropyl -D-1-thiogalactopyranoside and cultures were maintained at 20 \u00b0C for 6 hours. rabbit anti-core polyclonal sera (1:2000), commercial anti-His monoclonal antibody (1:1000, Invitrogen) and HRP-labelled secondary antibodies were excised, reduced, alkylated and digested with trypsin. the recovered peptides were analysed by LC-MS/MS. the library was initially transcribed with a hiScribe T7 high Yield RNA transcription kit. negative selections were carried out at each round of SELEX using bare His-Tag isolation and pulldown beads. stringency of the aptamer-target interaction was raised by increasing the number of washes from 10 to 15 (slower off-rate) the aptamer sequence with the best alignment to the genome was identified according to the Bernoulli score B. the results were rank-ordered, starting from the largest score, and all matches with the genome up to a Bernoulli score of 12 counted. the procedure was repeated for the other aptamer sequences, and corresponding matches added, resulting in the peaks in Fig. 2. pPSs with the former motif could correspond to high affinity PSs. pPSs with the latter motif could correspond to lower affinity PSs. mutagenesis of pJFH-1 to introduce silent mutations was performed. infectious HCV assays 6.0 106 Huh-7 cells were electroporated with 5 g of viral RNA at 975 F and 260 V for 25 ms. cells were resuspended in complete medium and seeded into multiple 6 well plates. 48 h.p.e. cells were harvested in TRIZol, protein lysis buffer or PBS. quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR RNA was purified by TRIZol extraction. 200 ng was used in a Taqman probe-based one-step qRT-PCR. cycle threshold (Ct) values were converted to genome copies per 200ng of input RNA. folded RNA was modified with either 100 mM N-methylisatoic anhydride or DMSO at 37 \u00b0C for 45 minutes. primers were labelled with -[33p]-ATP (PerkinElmer) and purified by ethanol precipitation prior to primer extension."}
