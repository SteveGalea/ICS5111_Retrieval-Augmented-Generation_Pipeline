{"summary": "exposure of the population of china to pH1N1 has resulted in an increase in respiratory illnesses. limited information is available on the etiology and clinical characteristics of the influenza-like illness that ensued in adults following the pH1N1 pandemic. influenza-like illness (ILI) in acute-care settings throughout the country are reported to the Chinese National Influenza Center (CNIC) there is inconsistency about whether certain symptoms can be used to distinguish specific infections. there is generally accepted that there are no symptoms specific to any viral infection. study focused on the etiology and epidemiological characteristics of adults with ILI symptoms after the 2009 influenza (H1N1) pandemic in Beijing. the study was conducted in accordance with the principles and guidelines expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. written consent forms were not required and approved information sheets were used instead of consent forms. the swab was immediately placed in virus transport media tubes. each sample was frozen within 24 hours at 70\u00b0C until analyzed. 98(65.8% of 149) 146(65.5% of 223) Diarrhea 1(1.6% of 61) 0(0%) 5(3.4% of 149) 6(2.7% of 223) Symptoms onset (days) 1(1\u20132)(n = 65) 1.5(1\u20132)(n = 190) 1(1\u20132)(n = 268) routine examination White cell count(109/l) 7.9(6.2\u20139.7)(n = 64) 9. s are median (IQR) or n (%) of patients unless otherwise stated. characteristics contain demography characteristics, medical history, presenting symptoms, and clinical findings. PCR RT-PCR products were tested as per manufacturer's instructions for the following viruses: influenza A and B virus; respiratory syncytial virus (RSV); human coronaviruses 229E, OC43, NL63, HKU1; parainfluenza virus; enterovirus or rhinoviruses; adenoviruses; and finally metapneumovirus. the samples were divided into two groups for testing. further typing Sections of throat swab specimens were randomly selected and periodically shipped in an icebox to the Beijing Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for virus isolation and confirmation of pH1N1 was performed in 190 samples. positive results followed by the haemagglutination inhibition test using reference antisera. case definition and study population A human influenza-like illness (ILI) case was clinically defined as a sudden onset of fever (38\u00b0C), cough and/or sore throat of less than three days duration. a co-infection was diagnosed when more than one virus tested positive on RT-PCR.

PCR was carried out in a PCR Amplifier and the conditions were as follows: 94\u00b0C for 15 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 0.5 minutes, 60\u00b0C for 1.5 minutes and 72\u00b0C for 1.5 minutes. group B samples were tested for the presence of influenza B virus, human coronavirus OC43/HKU1, rhinovirus (HRV A/B), RSV B/A, and FLU A. RT-PCR and sequencing was used to clarify the infection. continuously distributed variables were compared between FLU-A-positive ILI-cases and FLU-A-negative ILI-cases. the median white cell count was 8.3109/l [IQR (6.2\u201311.2)109/l], and the mean percentage of neutrophils was 77.6% [95%CI (76.3,79.0)%] clinical characteristics of ILI patients who tested positive for influenza A virus. there was no difference in the neutrophil percentage between those who tested positive for influenza-A and those who tested negative. the clinical and univariate characteristics of influenza-A virus ILI-case patients are shown in Table 2. Table 2. Characteristics of FLU-A and non-FLU-A ILI-patients in PKU People' Hospital betweenJune 2010 and may 2011. in 20 FLU-A-positive cases, 4 (20%) received antiviral treatment within three days of the onset of symptoms. a further 21.2% (11 of 52) of these RT-PCR-positive patients had been vaccinated. median duration of fever was four days [IQR 3\u20135] and 3 days [IQR 2\u20136] respectively. four of the eighteen patients aged 60 years or greater were positive for influenza A virus. no viral co-infections were observed for all detected H1N1-positive samples. influenza A (H3N2) viruses were the predominant viral etiological factors from June to early January in North China. influenza A (H3N2) viruses were the predominant viral etiological factors from June to early January. in 2010, the overall level of outpatient consultations was less than that of 2009, particularly between May and December. from May 2009, when pH1N1 emerged in Beijing, the capacity of the outpatient service of the Infectious Diseases Department of PKUPH increased rapidly. from then, the outpatient volume declined, reaching normal levels in the third month of 2010. the weekly ILI rate increased rapidly in the 35th week of 2009 in north china. the rate was relatively stable on the basis of the weekly ILI surveillance system of North China in 2010. the incidence rose slightly in January 2011 and the usual influenza seasonal peak appeared in the 5th week of 2011. the clinical and univariate characteristics of influenza-A virus ILI-case patients are shown in Table 2. patients infected with the virus experienced more cough than patients infected with other viruses or those free. other clinical characteristics (such as sore throat, headache) appeared to be more frequent in those infected. 3%) 71(55.0%) 1.542 0.835 to 2.845 0.165 Temperature(\u00b0C) 38.6[38.4,38.7] 38.6[38.5,38.7] 0.433 Cough 48(78.7%) 67(51.9%) 3.417 1.691 to 6.904 0.000 Sore throat 41(67.2%) 78(60.5%) 1.340 0.706 to 2.543 0.369 Headache 41(67.2%) in 20 cases, 4 (20%) received antiviral treatment within three days. a further 21.2% (11 of 52) of these RT-PCR-positive patients had been vaccinated. a further 11.3% (8 of 71) reported chronic comorbid conditions (diabetes mellitus in four and hypertension in four) four of the eighteen patients aged 60 years or greater were positive for influenza A virus. no viral co-infections were observed for all detected H1N1-positive samples. panel B shows the smaller number of other viruses. two of the three identified ILI samples in June were mixed infections, HRSV and HRV. other double infections included: one HRCV/FLU-A in July, one FLU-A/HRV in November, two HRSV-A and FLU-A and one HRSV-A and HRV and FLU-A in January 2011. 190 (68.1% of 279) samples were subtyped for 2009 influenza A (pH1N1) by the Beijing CDC. in 2010, the overall number of outpatients was less than that of 2009. from may 2009, when pH1N1 emerged in Beijing, the capacity of the outpatient service of the Infectious Diseases Department of PKUPH increased rapidly. pharyngeal swab specimens were collected from ILI case-patients. the general population in china has been exposed to the novel pandemic H1N1 influenza virus since mid May 2009. as of may 2011, 136869 confirmed cases and 875 deaths from pandemic influenza H1N1 2009 have been reported nationwide in mainland China. 80% of the RT-PCR positive cases were caused by FLU-A alone. influenza-like illness case-definition make influenza viruses as the virus most commonly detected. influenza viruses usually account for a much greater proportion of positive specimens of influenza-like illness in adults than other respiratory viruses during the peak seasons. in 197 (70.6%) specimens, no viral etiology was identified or the virus was not detected. in 197 (70.6%) specimens, no viral etiology was identified or the virus was not detected. it is possible that some viruses could not be detected due to low levels of shedding. cough and a fever>38\u00b0C were associated with a positive PCR test in the influenza population. this is consistent with the view of Call et al, who believe both fever and cough are more specific for influenza among elderly individuals when influenza virus is circulating in an area [30]."}
