{"summary": "a dynamical language (DL) method has successfully been applied to the phylogenetic analysis of bacteria and chloroplast genomes. a dynamical language (DL) method is used to analyze the whole-proteome phylogeny of 124 large dsDNA viruses and 30 parvoviruses. phylogenetic and taxonomic studies of viruses have become increasingly important as more whole viral genomes are sequenced. phylogeny based on single genes or gene families contains ambiguity because horizontal gene transfer (HGT) along with gene duplication and gene capture from hosts appear to be frequent in large DNA viruses. the parvoviruses constitute a family established in 1970 to encompass all small non-enveloped viruses with approximately 5 kb linear, self-priming, ssDNA genomes [21,22] this family is separated into two subfamilies, Parvovirinae and Densovirinae. Viruses in the subfamily Parvovirinae infect vertebrates and vertebrate cell cultures. there has been a growing interest in alignment-free methods for phylogenetic analysis using complete genome data [2,30,31] there has been a growing interest in alignment-free methods for phylogenetic analysis using complete genome data. the results showed that the MSM distance outperforms the other three distances and the CV Tree method. the dynamical language (DL) method [33] was modified by replacing the correlation distance (pseudo-distance) by the chord distance. the CV tree method cannot give good phylogenetic topology for the 62 -proteobacteria [40] in the family Baculoviridae, we only selected the African swine fever virus (ASFV, NC_001659) in the genus asfivirus. the virus is adoxophyes orana granulovirus (Adoxophyes orana granulovirus) Agrotis segetum granulovirus (AsGV, NC_005839), Cryptophlebia leucotreta granulovirus (CrleGV, NC_005839), Cydia pomonella granulovirus (CpGV, NC_002816), Phthorimaea operculella granulovirus (PhopGV, NC_004062), Plutella xylostella granulo polyhedrovirus A (MacoNPV_A, NC_003529), Mamestra configurata nucleopolyhedrovirus B (MacoNPV_B, NC_004117), Neodiprion sertifer nucleopolyhedrovirus (NeseNPV, NC_005905), orgyia pseudotsugata multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (OpM human herpesvirus 1 (HHV_1, NC_001806), Human herpesvirus 2 (HHV_2, NC_001798) and Cercopithecine herpesvirus 2 (CeHV_2, NC_006560) in genus Simplexvirus; Bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV_1, NC_001847), Bovine herpesvirus 5 (BoHV_5, NC_005261), Cercopithecine herpes human herpesvirus 4 (HHV_4, NC_009334) and Cercopithecine herpesvirus 15 (CeHV_15, NC_006146) in genus Lymphocryptovirus; Alcelaphine herpesvirus 1 (AIHV_1, NC_002531), Bovine herpesvirus 4 (BoHV_4, NC_002665), Equid herpesvirus 2 (EHV_2, NC_001650) is virus (ISaKNV, NC_003494) in genus Megalocytivirus; Frog virus 3 (FV_3, NC_005946), Regina ranavirus (ATV, NC_005832) and Singapore grouper iridovirus (SiGV, NC_006549) in genus Ranavirus. the two species in the family Phycodnaviridae are Paramecium bursaria Chlorella virus 1 (PB there are 20 species in the subfamily Parvovirinae and 10 species in the subfamily Densovirinae. the species in the subfamily Parvovirinae are 20 species. utian mink disease virus (ADMV, NC_001662) in the genus Amdovirus.

DL method [41] gives trees of the same topology for the same K for both data sets. the NJ tree of 124 large dsDNA virus genomes based on the all protein sequences using the modified DL method for K = 5. oviridae is divided into two genera Granulovirus and Nucleopolyhedrovirus. the unclassified virus NeleNPV belongs to genus Nucleopolyhedrovirus. another unclassified virus CuniNPV is located at the basal position of this family. the division of the family Herpesviridae into subfamilies Alphaherpesvirinae, Gammaherpesvirinae and Betaherpesvirinae is clear. the unclassified virus OsHV_1 groups with IcHV_1 suggesting its affiliation to the genus Iltovirus. our tree in [1] has 4 outliers (CuniNPV, IIV_6, IcHV_1 and OsHV_1) while ours has no outlier. the optimal feature length for FFP method is 8 implying that much longer computing time and larger computer space are needed. the parvoviruses AAV7, AAV8, AAAVa, BPV2, MPV, AdDNV and CeDNV are still not classified in the VIIIth Report of ICTV [20]. the parvoviruses AAV7, AAV8, AAAVa, BPV2, MPV, AdDNV and CeDNV are still not classified in the VIIIth Report of ICTV [23]. the DL method is superior (from the biological point of view) to the CV Tree method in phylogenetic inference. the method provides a quick reference on virus phylogeny and a fast analysis of co-evolution of viruses and their hosts when their proteomes are available. there are a total of N = 4K(for DNA sequences) or 20K(for protein sequences) possible types of K-mers. we define p(12...K) = n(12...K)/(L - K + 1) as the observed frequency of a K-mer 12...K, where n(12...K) is the number of times that 12...K appears in this sequence. sK could be constructed by adding a letter sK to the end of the (K-1)-mer s1s2...sK-1 or a letter s1 to the beginning of the (K-1)-mer s2s3...sK. the expected frequency of appearance of K-mers is predicted by where p(s1) and p(sK)are frequencies of nucleotides or amino acids s1and sK appearing in this genome. we construct trees for data sets 1 and 2 using the neighbour-joining (NJ) method [51] in the softwares Phylip [52] and SplitsTree4 [51]. the method of Qi et al. [34] is not applicable to the virus genomes as almost all virus genomes have only a few genes. Qi et al. [34] proposed a modified bootstrap method by resampling on the genes or translated proteins on the genome. the method of Qi et al.
