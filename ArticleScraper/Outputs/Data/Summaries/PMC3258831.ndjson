{"summary": "the cattle feeding operation is located in the central part of Serbia. the producer purchases weaned calves from local dual-purpose herds. the calves are allowed to suckle for the first 2 mo before creep feed is introduced and offered until they are weaned at 4 mo. calves C3 and C4 were submitted to the pathology department of the Veterinary Institute within 4 h of death. the carcasses were inoculated on Zeissler agar plates and incubated anaerobically for 48 h at 37\u00b0C. they were plated onto 5% sheep blood agar and incubated aerobically for 24 h at 37\u00b0C. -Vassiliadis broth (Himedia, Belgrade) streaked on MacConkey agar (Himedia, Belgrade), Brilliant Green agar (Himedia, Belgrade) and xylose lysine deoxycholate agar (XLD) agar (Himedia, Belgrade) and incubated aerobically for 24 h at 37\u00b0C. colonies recovered under anaerobic incubation were identified as Clostridium perf a 5- to 10-cm section was observed on a jejunal segment of 20-cm length. these segments contained large blood clots which caused luminal occlusion. the small intestines were red due to hemorrhage and the lumen was filled with dark reddish contents. Clostridium perfringens was isolated from all 4 calves. one isolate, from calf C3, possessed the 2-toxin gene. no other pathogenic bacteria were isolated. lesions of coccidiosis in cattle are limited to the ileum and cryptosporidiosis does not occur in animals at this age (23). PCR genotyping ruled out strains of types C and D; presented cases are illustrative of the extraordinary versatility of C. perfringens type A as a pathogen."}
