{"summary": "s2m appears to represent one of very few examples of mobile genetic elements in viruses. the function remains obscure and a scattered taxonomical distribution has been reported by numerous groups. results The stem-loop s2m structure can be found in four families of + ssRNA viruses. the s2m sequence is also present in the genome of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) where its three-dimensional crystal structure has been characterized in great detail. the function of s2m remains obscure, although in the case of SARS-CoV, it was suggested that the structure might interfere with protein synthesis through mimicry of small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) genomes of dog norovirus strains GVI.1/HKU_Ca026F/2007/HKG and GVI.1/HKU_Ca035F/2007/HKG had identical 3\u2019ends, both with two copies of s2m. a total of 706 sequences could be found from four different virus families. s2m-containing viruses did not form monophyletic groups in any of the four virus families. phylogenetic analysis of caliciviruses using partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequences (265 amino acids) and maximum likelihood (RAxML) phylogenetic analysis of coronaviruses using partial polyprotein sequences (2833 amino acids) and maximum likelihood (RAxML) bootstrap values of 100% have been indicated and s2m-containing sequences have been highlighted (boldface/underscore) Approximately unbiased (AU) test found that the tree where the s2m sequences were constrained into a single clade was significantly worse than the optimal tree. even constraining Bat picornavirus 3 and Canine picornavirus into a single clade was significantly worse than the optimal tree. a single gain of s2m was not rejected by the AU test. for the coronaviruses, two gains and two losses would have to be postulated in order to explain the distribution of s2m in the most parsimonious way. if the ancestral state for the gamma/delta coronavirus group was to contain s2m, losses would have to be proposed for the Beluga whale coronavirus. a single loss would have to be proposed for the avastroviruses (Avastrovirus 3 and CDB-2012) all members of the large, monophyletic group that includes the classical human astroviruses and has the California sea lion astrovirus 2 as the most basal branch contain s2m. the absence of s2m in the remaining isolates can be explained through a single loss. a model where containing the s2m motif is the proposed ancestral state for all + ssRNA viruses would have to postulate a large number of independent losses. this seems unlikely as s2m only appears to provide a somewhat subtle (yet immediate) selective advantage for the host viruses. the fact that s2m remains conserved in spite of the high mutation rates seen in RNA viruses indicates that the virus somehow benefits from acquiring the sequence motif. the most likely scenario for the emergence of a new s2m-containing virus would be a situation where a co-infection includes both an s2m-containing donor virus and a recipient virus. s2m-containg members have been postulated to have an avian origin. s2m is short, but due to its secondary structure it can be unambiguously aligned. there should also be sufficient characters that show some degree of variability to give reasonable resolution if data from closely related species are compared. however, we were unable to assess whether the two copies of s2m found in the dog norovirus strains came from independent sources or if they are the result of some sort of duplication event and subsequent independent evolution. the s2m sequence motif appears to be an active mobile genetic element. it seems likely that s2m provides some kind of selective advantage for the viruses that contain the motif. a possible function could be related to RNAi-like gene regulation of infected organisms. etic analyses were available when investigating the evolutionary relationship between the (s2m-containing) viruses. s2m motifs (43\u201344 nucleotides long) were individually extracted and aligned. the following consensus sequence could be generated. a biased test was calculated using CONSEL [23]. Competing interests The authors declare that they have no competing interests. TRB conceptualized the project together with CMJ, collected the sequence data and constructed the amino acid alignments. the specific constraints on s2m clades are shown in the table below. in all cases the differences in log likelihood and p-values for the different trees are shown."}
