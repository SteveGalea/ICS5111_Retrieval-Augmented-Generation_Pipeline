{"summary": "Candida albicans is the most common fungal pathogen of humans. it is the fourth leading pathogen in nosocomial bloodstream infections. invasive candidiasis is associated with high mortality among immunocompromised populations. the emergence of antifungal resistance and treatment side effects have further restricted treatment options because of the already limited arsenal of current antifungal agents. only a few classes of antifungal drugs (polyenes, azoles, echinocandins, allylamines and DNA analogues) are available for candidiasis treatment [19], but these drugs are far from ideal. the identified hits were further assessed for antifungal and anti-biofilm activity. we screened for Y-H inhibitors in a library containing 50,240 small molecules. these 20 primary hits were further validated by assessing their activity in a dose-dependent manner. small molecules were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and added to the wells at final concentration of 20 g/ml. controls contained the same amount of DMSO but without small molecules. the minimum inhibitory concentration of MICY-H transition (MICY-H) was determined as the minimum concentration at which no hyphae were observed. the assay was performed on three different occasions in duplicate per isolate. paper coupons were placed on the agar, and either 2 g of the small molecule or PBS (as a negative control) was added onto the coupons. the agar plates were incubated aerobically at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. each well of the microtitre plate (Iwaki) was inoculated with 100 l yeast suspension. cells were allowed to adhere to the well bottoms by incubating at 37\u00b0C, 75 rpm for 1.5 h (adhesion phase) the biofilm was then incubated at 37\u00b0C, 75 rpm for 24 h. anti-biofilm assay using an in vitro denture stomatitis model Cold-cured polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) discs were prepared according to the manufacturers' instructions. transparent self-polymerising acrylic powder was mixed with monomer liquid at a 1.51 ratio (w/v) the strips were immersed in distilled water for 7 days to remove excess monomers, and then disinfected in 70% alcohol for 1 min. the adhesion phase was assessed 1.5 h after inoculation. the plate was then placed in a shaking incubator at 37\u00b0C. the cell viability of the biofilm was quantified by the XTT reduction assay. l of drugs or controls (0.2 g/l SM21, 1 g/l amphotericin B and 0.5 g/l caspofungin) were placed on the agar. the plates were incubated anaerobically at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. the diameters of inhibition zones were measured. the plate was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 h, and then the viability of the HOKs was determined by MTT assay. human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) and monocyte cell lines were also used. each cell line was seeded in T-75 flasks, and after confluence was reached, 2 g SM21 in 10 ml of growth medium was added to each flask. each well contained approximately 1105 HOKs at confluence. a suspension of C. albicans SC5314 (1104 CFUs/ml) was prepared in the growth medium. SM21 was added at various final concentrations (0.5, 1 and 2 g/ml) the mice were given twice a day for 5 days via intraperitoneal injection. the test group (n = 5) was treated with 0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10 mg/kg SM21 in 100 l PBS. the control group (n = 5) was treated with 0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10 mg/kg SM21. 10 l SM21 (200 g/ml; n = 3), 10 l nystatin (10 g/ml; n = 3) or 10 l PBS (as a control; n = 3) was administered to the mice by pipetting into their mouths. the tongue lesion degree was evaluated using a scoring system of 0 \u2013 3 [40], with 0 denoting a healthy tongue surface and 3 the most severe stage. c. albicans SC5314 were seeded at 5103 cells per well in complete yeast peptone dextrose (YPD), supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated foetal bovine serum. the small molecules were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and were added to the wells at final concentration of 20 g/ml. small molecules with lower scores than that of the control (yeast-to-hypha transition inhibitors) were selected as primary hits. further evaluation of Y-H inhibition by the primary hits was further examined using the reference strain C. albicans SC5314. 92 bloodstream isolates (Queen Mary Hospital and Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Hong Kong) and 46 oral isolates from nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients (Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong) all of the isolates were subcultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) and were incubated aerobically at 37\u00b0C overnight before the assay. yeast suspensions were prepared in a 96-well microtitre plate (Iwaki, Tokyo, Japan) serial dilutions of the small molecules were prepared with the medium and added to the wells. Candida growth on the well bottoms was visually observed to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration. biofilm was incubated at 37\u00b0C, 75 rpm for 24 h. SM21 (0.2 \u2013 100 g/ml) was added to the biofilm. cell viability of the treated biofilms was measured by the XTT reduction assay. the strips were immersed in distilled water for 7 days to remove excess monomers. they were then disinfected in 70% alcohol for 1 min and washed thrice with sterile distilled water. saliva was collected from five healthy volunteers and centrifuged at 12,000 g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. the PHWP1-GFP strain was used to test the effect of SM21 on HWP1 expression. the strains were cultivated overnight at 37\u00b0C in Lee's medium containing SM21 at MIC (0.2 g/ml) or 2MIC (0.4 g/ml) 16 antifungal-resistant Candida strains were evaluated by antifungal susceptibility tests. the strains were clinical blood isolates belonging to various Candida spp., which had been confirmed to have resistance to one or more antifungal agents by CLSI antifungal susceptibility tests. a yellow tetrazolium dye is converted into a purple compound by mitochondrial enzymes. the dye was solubilised with an equal amount of DMSO. the absorbance of the converted dye was measured at 570 nm with background subtraction at 650 nm. SM21 was added at various final concentrations (0.5, 1 and 2 g/ml) whereas positive controls contained only the growth medium. the plate was then incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 h in the presence of 5% CO2. the viability of HOKs and yeast cells was assessed by confocal laser scanning microscopy using fluorescent probes. mouse model of oral candidiasis was established according to a previously described method. mice were anesthetised with 50 l chlorpromazine chloride (2 mg/ml) the tongue lesion degree was evaluated using a scoring system of 0 \u2013 3 [40], with 0 denoting a healthy tongue surface and 3 the most severe stage. the entire oral cavities of the mice were swabbed with sterilised cotton swabs, which were then submerged in 500 l PBS and vortexed vigorously. the resultant suspension was spiral plated on SDA, and the number of CFUs was counted after incubation at we first screened 50,240 small molecules for inhibitors of the Y-H transition in C. albicans. of these, eight compounds displayed strong dose-dependent Y-H inhibition under hypha-inducing conditions for the reference strain C. albicans SC5314 and ten clinical isolates of C. albicans. the assay identified eight potent Y-H inhibiting small molecules. the standard deviations are shown for each sample, and asteriks indicate p-value 0.05. SM10, SM12, SM16 and SM21 had the lowest MICbiofilm among the four hits. MICY-H was directly proportional to the cell density (Table 1). MICY-H was directly proportional to the cell density (Table 1). SM21-mediated Y-H inhibition against strain CL1, a clinical isolate. the inhibition of HWP1 expression of SM21 was examined by confocal microscopy. no trace of fluorescence was detected from SM21-treated cells. SM21 is active against fungi but not bacteria. MIC of SM21 against C. albicans ATCC 90028 was found to be 0.2 g/ml. lower susceptibility to SM21 was noted with the fungus A. fumigatus. SM21 did not inhibit the growth of any of the six bacterial species evaluated in disk diffusion assay. MICs of SM21 against Candida isolates ranged from 0.2 \u2013 1.6 g/ml. MICs of amphotericin B ranged from 0.2 \u2013 0.8 g/ml. similar range of MICs suggested the comparable potency of SM21 and amphotericin B. SM21 demonstrated a lower MICbiofilm than amphotericin B and caspofungin for both 24-h and 48-h biofilm. in an in vitro model of denture stomatitis, SM21 effectively prevented candidal adhesion and biofilm development on denture acrylic surfaces. biofilm cell viability was maximised when SM21 was added before or after the adhesion phase. the reduced biofilm viability was maximised (97%) when SM21 was added both before and after the adhesion phase. all of the drug-resistant isolates tested were susceptible to SM21. glabrata T1585 F,I,K,V 1 C. tropicalis T1427 I 1 C. tropicalis T789 I 1 C. tropicalis T1148 I 0.5 C. krusei T1472 F,I,K 1 C. krusei T1266 F 0.5 C. krusei T1266 F 1 C. guilliermondii T1549 A,C,F 1 A \u2013 amphotericin B, C both SM21 (0.2 g/ml) and amphotericin B (0.2 g/ml) reduced viability of HOKs and monocytes. treatment with SM21 or amphotericin B caused a 20% or 5% reduction in monocyte viability compared with the controls. SM21 prevents candidal invasion of human cells in vitro. samples containing 0.5 g/ml or 2 g/ml SM21 included few yeast cells and no hyphae, and most of the HOKs were alive. SM21 improves survival in a mouse model of systemic candidiasis. the survival rates for untreated and SM21-treated mice were 0% and 100%. SM21 significantly reduced the renal fungal burden in the kidneys of the mice by an order of magnitude of 3. nystatin-treated mice showed the least severe tongue lesions. a thick oral thrush (score = 3) was observed in untreated mice. a thick oral thrush (score = 3) was observed in untreated mice. C. albicans treated with sub-MIC of SM21 showed propidium iodide uptake (labeled by red fluorescence), indicating cell membrane damage. some of the cells (denoted by white arrow) were non-viable. the assay identified eight potent Y-H inhibiting small molecules. the MICbiofilm was determined as the concentration where the viability of the biofilm was reduced by 50% as compared with the positive control. SM21 had the lowest MICbiofilm among the four hits in both cases. MICY-H of SM21 was 0.43 g/ml (equivalent to 0.98 M) the MICY-H of SM21 was 0.43 g/ml (equivalent to 0.98 M) was similar to the average MICY-H for ten clinical isolates (0.5 g/ml) cell density MICY-H (CFUs/ml) g/ml M 104 0.125 0.29 106 0.14 107 1 2.28 108 10 22.8 Results are the mean values of three independent experiments performed in duplicate for each of the ten clinical C. albicans isolates CL1 \u2013 CL10. no trace of fluorescence could be detected from the SM21-treated cells. SM21 formed inhibition zones with C. albicans SC5314, C. albicans ATCC 90028 and all of the clinical isolates tested. the average diameter of the inhibition zones of SM21 against these isolates was 27.7 mm (range = 25 \u2013 31 mm) albicans CL3 1.6 0.4 C. albicans CL4 0.8 0.2 C. albicans CL6 1.6 0.2 C. albicans CL7 0.8 0.2 C. albicans CL9 1.6 0.4 C. albicans CL9 1.6 0.4 C. albicans CL10 1.6 0.2 C. glabrata ATCC90030 1.6 0.4 C. tropicalis ATCC6258 0.4 0.4 C. paraps SM21 inhibits biofilm formation. we then assessed the activity of SM21 against Candida biofilm formation. SM21 demonstrated a lower MICbiofilm than amphotericin B and caspofungin. all cells were labeled with the green fluorescence, while only the dead cells were labeled with red fluorescence. reduced biofilm viability was maximised (97%) when SM21 was added before or after the adhesion phase. SM21 displays low toxicity to human cells Cytotoxicity assays performed in a 96-well plate revealed the CC50 of SM21 to be 3.4 g/ml (7.8 M) for HOKs. treatment with SM21 or amphotericin B caused a 20% or 5% reduction in monocyte viability compared with the controls. neither SM21 nor amphotericin B affected the viability of HGFs. the viability of co-cultured HOKs and yeast cells in the presence of SM21 was assessed by confocal laser scanning microscopy using fluorescent probes. samples containing 0.5 g/ml SM21 still included many hyphae, but they contained more live HOKs than the untreated control. SM21 improves survival in a mouse model of systemic candidiasis. SM21 reduces tongue lesions in a mouse model of oral candidiasis. results indicated that SM21 was effective in preventing systemic spread and invasion of Candida in the mouse model. SM21-treated mice showed the least severe tongue lesions (score = 2). Candida cell counts from tongue swabs were consistently lower than those of the control mice (4.8103 CFUs/ml) and nystatin-treated animals (6.0102 CFUs/ml) Candida cell counts from tongue swabs were consistently lower than those of the control mice (4.8103 CFUs/ml) SM21 showed abundant propidium iodide uptake, indicating cell membrane damage. the molecular target of SM21 might be a component of the cell membrane. untreated control samples showed hyphal elements of live C. albicans cells. the Y-H inhibitor screening assay selects for molecules that block the change from the yeast form of C. albicans to the hyphal form, as assessed by morphology. however, this ambiguity of the screening assay was favourable for increasing the hit rate in our initial screening. MIC of SM21 in broth microdilution assays for a wide range of C. albicans strains is similar or more potent than that of amphotericin B or caspofungin. SM21 is effective at reducing candidal attachment to denture acrylic surfaces and inhibiting biofilm development in an in vitro model of denture stomatitis. oral thrush was observed at the back of the tongues in nystatin-treated mice. however, no detrimental effects were observed in mice that had been injected with SM21 doses as high as 10 mg/kg twice daily. the concentration used in our experiments (10 g/ml) might not be high enough to produce an optimal outcome. an SM21 dose of 0.1 mg/kg or higher twice daily beginning 3 h post-infection significantly reduced fungal burden in non-neutropenic mice. the in vivo efficacy of SM21 is similar to that of conventional antifungal agents in comparable non-neutropenic mouse models of systemic C. albicans candidiasis. SM21 is a promising compound for development of novel antifungal agent for treating local and systemic candidiasis. findings support SM21 as promising compound for development of novel antifungal agent for treating local and systemic candidiasis."}
