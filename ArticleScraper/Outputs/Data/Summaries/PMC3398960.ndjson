{"summary": "public reporting of hospital-acquired infection rates has been introduced in multiple health care systems. but its relationship to infection rates has been understudied. our objective was to determine whether mandatory public reporting is associated with a reduction in hospital-acquired infections. a stay in hospital can be lifesaving but can expose people to health care-associated infections. C. difficile bacteria cause diarrhea and, more rarely, life-threatening inflammation of the gut (colitis) they are present in the gut of about 3% of adults but do not normally cause any problems because other \u201cgood\u201d bacteria keep them in check. in the pre-intervention period, there were nearly 34,000 cases of C. difficile disease during about 39 million hospital days. after the introduction of public reporting, the C. difficile disease rate fell to 8.92 cases per 10,000 patient-days, which is significantly lower than the 12.16 cases per 10,000 patient-days predicted by the pre-intervention model. the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides detailed information about C. difficile infections. the health protection agency provides information about mandatory reporting of C. difficile infections in England and Wales and a fact sheet on C. difficile Information about public reporting of hospital C. difficile rates in Ontario is available. the benefits and hazards of public reporting systems may vary depending on the specific clinical context. public reporting is particularly understudied in the domain of hospital-acquired infections. the Ontario Drug Benefit database includes physician billing claims for all visits and procedures performed within Ontario's universal single-payer health care system. the Ontario Drug Benefit database contains comprehensive and accurate (>99% concordant with chart review) outpatient drug information for 1.2 million elderly residents. the net population at risk was considered to be all Ontario patients admitted to acute care hospital beds. the primary outcome was the hospital- and age-specific monthly rates of C. difficile disease per 10,000 hospital patient-days. a in the pre-intervention period (77 monine age groups180 institutions), and 30,780 potential strata in the post-intervention period (19 monine age groups180 institutions) the actual number of strata was slightly lower (133,418) given that not all age strata were represented in all hospital-months. longitudinal trend with both linear and non-linear functions. we used 6.5 y of data to model pre-reporting trends. predicted cases and 95% confidence intervals for a calendar month after public reporting were computed as the observed number of cases. population-based cohort study of all patients (>1 y old) admitted to acute care hospitals in Ontario between April 1, 2002 and March 31, 2010. data Sources The cohort was derived from a linkage of well-validated, province-wide health care administrative databases housed at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences [15],[16]. cases deemed by the institution to have been acquired in their own hospital are incorporated into the numerator of monthly publicly reported rates. however, for this study we had access to overall C. difficile rates, including cases assigned to any of the three categories. data from September 1, 2008, to march 31, 2010 were used to compare hospital-level C. difficile counts to publicly reported counts. 124,740 potential strata in the pre-intervention period, and 30,780 potential strata in the post-intervention period. the unit of analysis was the hospital, month, and age group stratum. the dependent variable was the number of C. difficile infections in each stratum. all models included age group, pre-reporting calendar month (to account for seasonal trends), concurrent and 1- to 12-mo lagged provincial monthly rates of prescriptions of antimicrobials. the decrease in hospital C. difficile rates was computed for the overall population, as well as for hospital subtypes. we excluded hospitals with discordant rates of C. difficile in public reporting and administrative datasets. the unit of analysis was the hospital, month, and age group stratum. the dependent variable was the number of C. difficile infections in each stratum. the offset parameter was the number of patient-days in each stratum. all models included age group, pre-reporting calendar month (to account for seasonal trends), hospital facility type (acute teaching, large community, or small community) the decrease in hospital C. difficile rates was computed for the overall population, as well as for hospital subtypes. we excluded hospitals with discordant rates of C. difficile in public reporting and administrative datasets. each bubble represents a distinct institution (n = 165), and bubble sizes reflect hospital sizes (in patient-days) there was an excellent correlation for overall C. difficile cases (A) and hospital-acquired C. difficile cases (B) (weighted Pearson's correlation coefficient 0.92), and hospital-acquired C. difficile cases (B). crude C. difficile rates increased over this pre-intervention period, from 7.01 per 10,000 patient-days in 2002, to 6.39 in 2003, 8.14 in 2004, 9.5 in 2005, 8.23 in 2006, and 10.79 in 2007. yearly antibiotic consumption increased from 2,110,184 prescriptions in 2003, to 2,323,006 in 2008, and 2,426,138 in 2009.
