{"summary": "enterovirus type 71 (EV71) is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus. polioviruses encode a polyprotein precursor into at least 11 different proteins. the 2A protease of poliovirus, a representative member of the Picornaviridae, is a cysteine protease. primers (2AY-S and 2AY-AS101) were used to perform PCR to clone the DNA fragments encoding EV71 2A protease without amino acids from 146 to 149 using the same approach. PCR was performed with primer pairs (2AY-S and 2AY-130AS, 2AY-S and 2AY-110AS, 2AY-S and 2AY-90AS) to clone the DNA fragments encoding EV71 2A prote 2AY-61S (5'-GGAATTCATCATCTACCAC-3') 2AY-90AS (5'-TTATTAATAATAATACTCGCTGGCCTC-3') 2AY-130AS (5'-TTATTAGCAATCCCCTGGCCTC-3') VP1/2A-S (5'-CCATCGATATGATGGGTACGTTC-3') 2A-S10 (5'-GGAATTCATGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG mRNA extracted from a patient infected with coxsackie virus B3 was converted into cDNA. oligonucleotide primers (CoxB2AY-S and CoxB2AY-AS) were used to perform. PCR was performed using primer pairs (CoxB2AY-61 S and CoxB2AY-AS) to clone the DNA fragments encoding Coxsackie virus 2A protease with the N-terminal truncation of 60 amino acids. another PCR was performed with primer pairs (CoxB2AY-S and CoxB2AY-127AS) to clone the DNA fragments encoding the C-terminus of EV71 primers (C110A-S and 2AY-AS2) were used to amplify the 3'-end of the gene fragment. these two DNA fragments were linked together by PCR using primers (VP1/2A-S and 2AY-AS2) after the PCR, the DNA fragment was digested by restriction enzymes (ClaI/XbaI) and cloned into the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, USA) cloned into expression vector pcDNA3.1-V5-His A (Invitrogen, USA) to clone the EV71 2A protease without potential NES (amino acid 31 to 42) for confocal microscopy analysis, the DNA fragment containing the mutation of amino acid 110 from Cys to Ala was used as the PCR template. primers (2A-S10 and L30/43-AS) were used to amplif cells were seeded at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. cells were seeded at a density of approximately 4 105 cells per 60-mm culture dish. at 48 hours after transfection, recombinant proteins expressed in cells were analyzed. cells were washed with PBS twice for 2 minutes each, and then incubated with anti-V5 antibody (1:20 dilution) at 37\u00b0C for 30 minutes. DAPI (Merck, Germany) was used to stain the nucleus. PCR was performed with primer pairs (2AY-21 S and 2AY-AS, 2AY-41 S and 2AY-61 S and 2AY-AS, 2AY-61 S and 2AY-90AS) to clone the DNA fragments encoding EV71 2A protease with the C-terminal deletion of 20, 40, 60 amino acids respectively. another PCR was performed with primer pairs (2AY-S and 2AY-130AS, 2AY-S and 2AY-110AS 2A-AS2 (5'-GCTCTAGACTACTGCTCCATCATGGCTTCATCATCATC-3') C110A-S (5'-CCAGGGGGTGGCATCATCATCATC-3') C110A-AS (5'-CCAGGGGGCATCATCATCATCATC-3') L30/43-S (5'-CATAATGACTGGCATCATCATCATCATCAT-3') 2AY-AS101 (5'-CCAGGGGGCATCATCATCATCAT-3' mRNA extracted from a patient infected with Coxsackie virus B3 was converted into cDNA. primer pairs were used to clone the DNA fragments encoding the full-length Coxsackie virus 2A protease with the N-terminal truncation of 60 amino acids. mRNA was converted into cDNA and oligonucleotide primers were used to perform PCR. PCR was performed using oligonucleotide primers (VP1/2A-S and 2AY-AS2) to mutate amino acid 110 of EV71 2A protease from Cys to Ala. after the PCR, the DNA fragment was digested by restriction enzymes (ClaI/XbaI) and cloned into the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, USA) PCR was performed using oligonucleotide primers (VP1/2A-S and 2AY-AS3). after the PCR, the DNA fragment was digested by restriction enzymes (ClaI/XbaI) and cloned into the expression vector pcDNA3.1-V5-His A (Invitrogen, USA) primers (L30/43-S and 2A-AS3) were used to amplify the 3'-end fragment. the fragment was digested by restriction enzymes (EcoRI/XbaI) and cloned into the expression vector pcDNA3.1-V5-His A (Invitrogen, USA) transfection, recombinant proteins expressed in cells were analyzed by Western blot. rabbit polyclonal antibodies against ERK-2 and eIF4G were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (USA) monoclonal antibodies against PARP were purchased from SEROTEC (UK) pcDNA3.1-IRES-2A cells were transfected with plasmids of vector alone or pcDNA3.1-IRES-2A using Arrest-InTMtransfection reagent. after 72 hours, cellular mRNAs were extracted and our previous procedures were followed for real-time RT-PCR [11] results EV71 2A protease exhibited strong transcriptional activity in yeast cells EV71 2A protease. plasmids encoding the C-terminus of VP1 protein, full-length 2A protease wild-type or with mutation in amino acid 110 from Cys to Ala were constructed and transfected into HeLa cells. EV71 2A protease with this mutation still possessed transcriptional activity in yeast cells. cell lysates were detected using rabbit anti-EV71 2A protein polyclonal antibody (A), mouse anti-eIF4G monoclonal antibody (B) and mouse anti-PARP monoclonal antibody (C) the thin arrows indicate the uncleaved proteins (VP1-2A, intact eIF4G, or intact PARP) the thick arrows indicate the cleaved products (2A, cleaved eIF4G, or intact PARP protein without amino acids 31 to 42 localized in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus but not in the nucleus only. protein expression of various EV71 2A protein mutants with V5 tag in the C-terminus. al acidic region of poliovirus 2Apro is critical for viral RNA replication. EV71 2A protease without amino acids 146-149 still retained its protease activity but lost its transcriptional activity. cells were transfected with vector only (lane 1) or with plasmid encoding the C-terminus of VP1. real-time RT-PCR was performed to determine whether EV71 2A protease could transactivate PCBP2, PTBP1, RTN3, GBF1, CD55, or SAM68 gene. however, EV71 2A protease repressed rather than transactivated all of these cellular genes. this reaction is quite specific since none of the other proteins we studied at. the same time exhibited this activity, including EV 71 3C protein, hepatitis C virus NS5A protein, NS3 protein(data not shown), or ARFP [7]. deletion of 20 amino acids at the C-terminus of EV71 2A protease resulted in the loss of transcriptional activity (Figure 1). EV71 2A protease with this mutation still possessed transcriptional activity in yeast cells. potential NES (a.a. 31-42) is indicated with red letters. confocal microscopy analysis was used to examine sub-cellular localization of EV71 2A protein. expression plasmid encoding the C-terminus of VP1 protein, full-length 2A protease and V5 tag was constructed and transfected into HeLa cells. plasmid encoding 2A protein deleting amino acids from 32 to 41. cell lysates were analyzed using mouse anti-V5 tag monoclonal antibody. thick line indicates location of 2A protein deleting amino acids from 32 to 41. la cells were transfected with vector only (lane 1) or with the plasmid encoding the C-terminus of VP1 and wild-type 2A (lane 2). after transfection, cell lysates were analysed using mouse anti-V5 tag monoclonal antibody. thin arrow indicates the uncleaved protein (VP1-2A in lanes 2-4) while thick arrow indicates the 2A protein (lanes 2-4) fragment encoding full-length Coxsackie virus B3 2A protease was amplified by PCR and fused with the DNA-binding domain of Gal4. this fusion protein also activates reporter genes in yeast. EV71 2A protease is expected to enter the nucleus by passive diffusion. acidic domain (rich in Glu (E) or Asp (D), Figure 2B) was found in the C-terminus of EV71 2A protease. 9aa TAD possessing an autonomous transactivation activity in yeast and mammalian cells was also found at the N-terminus of EV71 2A protease. a previous report showed that poliovirus 2Apro is critical for viral RNA replication but not for cis- or trans- proteolytic cleavage. EV71 2A protease without amino acids 146-149 retained its protease activity. thus, enteroviral 2A proteases may transactivate some cellular genes to benefit virus replication.
