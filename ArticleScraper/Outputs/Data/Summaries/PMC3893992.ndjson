{"summary": "a) natural outbreaks, b) bioterrorism, and c) laboratory accidents are considered by biosecurity policymakers. the three rationalities incorporate disparate rationalities coming from different sociopolitical practices. this interaction is deeply related to u.s. politics. new normality (9) and biosecurity scenarios (10) are the only way to evaluate future events. as future happenings are uncertain, effective policymaking becomes an extremely difficult task, if possible at all. a distant possibility, because of its potential effect, is taken as a very close one. preparedness policies are built in a context characterized by the on-the-making processes that flood biosecurity controversies. they are deeply rooted in the idea that preparedness is continuous (13); it is not seen as a final objective but as an ongoing process that can hardly be closed down. a 60-day moratorium on HPAI H5N1 research was declared on January 2012. a final meeting between the NSABB and the authors took place in march 2012. the controversy was fed by the discussion on the potential risks and benefits of H5N1 gain-of-function research. a program that engages many countries is considered a basic tool for Influenza preparedness. not sharing this information with the rest of the members of the PIP could be seen as problematic, motivating some countries to fall off the program. the bio-objectification process begins to be evident inside the controversy as the sample is transported from a biobank in Hong Kong to a biolaboratory in Amsterdam, in the case of Fouchier, and from Vietnam to the US, in the case of Kawaoka. the bio-objectification process starts to be evident inside the controversy. both mutated viruses incorporate the ability to be transmitted among humans (inferred through an animal model), but lose its high pathogenicity. regulation \u2013 a process inside the symbolic dimension of the bio-objectification process \u2013 is required as the new capabilities and materiality do not totally fit with the known identity of the virus. genetic engineering of the virus reminds us of the mobile barrier between epidemic, epizootic, and zoonotic diseases. the new virus enters, discursively, more and more disciplinary areas. the bio-objects framework seems to be useful in order to analyze the most molecular dimensions of biosecurity. it helps connecting the practical dimensions attached to the practice of microbiology to the political dimensions attached to policymaking."}
