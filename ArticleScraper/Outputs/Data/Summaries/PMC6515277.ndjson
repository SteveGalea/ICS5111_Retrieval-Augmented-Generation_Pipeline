{"summary": "paralogous proteins merlin (also called neurofibromatosis type 2 tumor suppressor, NF2 or schwannomin) provide an interesting platform on which to study the evolution, divergence and acquisition of functional differences in a family of highly similar and highly conserved proteins. the most well studied ERM, ezrin, has been implicated in the formation of specialized actin-linked plasma membrane structures. the FERM domain binds to membranes, integral membrane proteins and scaffolding/effector proteins. the C-terminal domain binds to the cortical actin cytoskeleton. the merlin-ERMs act as linkers between membranes and the underlying actin cytoskeleton. an autoinhibited \u201cclosed\u201d state and an active \u201copen\u201d form. in the closed form, the CTD binds to a site on the FERM domain. merlin functions both at the membrane and in the nucleus. merlin-ERM proteins appear to have evolved near the emergence of metazoa [16] choanoflagellates are the closest single-celled eukaryotes to the metazoa. the other members of the opisthokonta, including fungi, do not contain merlin-ERM genes. the emergence of merlin-ERM genes and their divergence into separate merlin and ERM proteins are linked to the evolution of cell differentiation, specialization and multicellular organization in metazoa. the upper arbor shows ERM proteins spanning early branching metazoa through to vertebrates. the vertebrate ERMs diverge into distinct ezrin, radixin and moesin clades. invertebrates have only 2 genes encoding merlin-ERM proteins. one gene encodes merlin homolog and the other is a general ERM protein sharing traits with all the ERM proteins. the FERM domains show a higher level of sequence identity over the ERM proteins (67%) ezrin and moesin appear to be expressed as a single isoform from the genes EZR (also called VIL2) and MSN. a single missense mutation (R171W) has been identified as the cause of an X-linked primary immunodeficiency [22]. merlin isoforms 1 and 2 are the predominantly expressed isoforms in human tissue. one key difference between merlin isoform 1 and remaining isoforms is the nature of the merlin C-terminus from Leu580 onwards. merlin isoforms 2 (also known as II and annotated as \u2018isoform 3\u2032 on Uniprot), 4, 5, 6 and 8 replace the C-terminus. the new C-terminus is 5 residues shorter, more hydrophilic at the very C-terminus but more hydrophobic closer to the expressed splice junction. the structure of this altered C-terminus is most likely to differ from that of the major merlin isoform 1 and the ERM proteins. however, it remains to be resolved whether this altered C-terminus weakens the FERM\u2013CTD interaction in these merlin isoforms. Isoform 8 is expressed moderately. it also carries the C-terminal sequence variation as per isoforms 3\u20136. it includes the C-terminus of helix 1H and part of the N-terminus of helix 2H. the main isoform, isoform 1, is a 583 amino acid protein. the most common feature of the remaining isoforms is a 21 amino acid extension on the C-terminus. Isoform 2 is missing the complete FERM domain (residues 1\u2013347) with the 21 amino acid extension following the C-terminus. in radixin knockout mice the two main phenotypes are hearing impairment and hyperbilirubinemia. this defective liver phenotype has not been observed in human patients with mutations in radixin. the protein is colored as a rainbow from the blue N-terminus to the red C-terminus. analysis of merlin isoforms shows that many of the isoforms are minimally expressed. some of the isoforms are comprised of only small sections of the protein. for radixin, it is possible that these short isoforms are carrying out purely signaling roles. choanoflagellates have separate ERM and merlin genes. pairs of merlin and ERM genes are also present in early branching metazoa. most bilateria have both merlin and ERM genes, apart from platyhelminthes. the tree was drawn using the program FigTree v1.4.2 [19] using the EMBL-EBI webserver. the evolution of vertebrates is accompanied by the generation of at least three ERM paralogs, namely ezrin, radixin and moesin. the figure was prepared using the EMBL-EBI webserver. the figure was prepared using the program Jalview [21]. the number of identical residues is given divided by the length of the alignment. ezrin is expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, epithelial cells, kidney, spleen and lymph nodes. ezrin is expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, epithelial cells, kidney, spleen and lymph nodes. there are 10 different isoforms of merlin as reported by Uniprot. merlin isoforms 1 and 2 are the predominantly expressed isoforms in human tissue. isoforms 2 (also known as II and annotated as \u2018isoform 3\u2032 on Uniprot) replace the C-terminal sequence by including exon 16 which contains an in frame stop codon. the new C-terminus is 5 residues shorter, more hydrophilic at the very C-terminus but more hydrophobic closer to the expressed splice junction. variant arose early in vertebrate evolution around the time vertebrates invaded dry land. merlin isoforms 4, 5, and 6 are also missing large portions of the C-terminus. merlin isoforms 4, 5, and 6 are also missing large portions of the C-terminus. a large number of mutations within merlin are known to cause or contribute to the diseases neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) [46], schwannomatosis 1 (SWNTS1) [47] and a form of malignant mesothelioma (MESOM) [48] Radixin (expressed from RDX) is similar to merlin in that it is expressed as at least 5 isoforms by alternative splicing. the main isoform, mutation in radixin (D578N) gives rise to form of non-syndromic sensorineural autosomal recessive deafness (DFNB24) in humans. it is not obvious why such a mutation should give rise to this phenotype. in radixin knockout mice the two main phenotypes are hearing impairment. ferm:CTD complexes of human merlin (4ZRJ, red) [62], ezrin (4RM9, Blue) [56] and moesin (1EF1, cyan) [61] and S. frugiperda ERM (2I1K, magenta) [55] displaying almost identical tertiary structure. analysis of merlin isoforms shows that many of them are minimally expressed. only one full-length ERM protein structure has been solved in the closed, autoinhibited state. the protein represents a common ancestral ERM protein monomer prior to divergence into the separate ezrin, radixin and moesin paralogs. crystal structures of FERM domains from merlin, ezrin and moesin have also been determined. ferM domains were expressed separately in merlin, ezrin and moesin. ferM domain is an evolutionarily conserved 30 kDa composite domain. talin also includes a second ubiquitin-like subdomain, F0, at the N-terminus. the properties of F1 plus the F1-F2 linker and helix 1F2 in F2 are such that talin could potentially form a cloverleaf arrangement as per the other FERM domains. the clefts between FERM subdomains are labeled a, b and c. middle panel shows the electrostatic surface in the same view. right panel rotates 180\u00b0 about a vertical axis in the plane of the page. the merlin-ERM FERM domain is a defining feature of a large number of proteins whose biological roles include linking the cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane. there are two crystal structures of the FERM domain bound to PI(4,5)P2) mimetics, either IP3 or short chain PI(4,5)P2 mimetics. helix 1H lies along FERM subdomain F2 and it is essentially part of the globular FERM domain. helix 1H adopts the same packing with respect to the FERM domain as seen in the structure of the full-length Sfmoesin [55]. the length of the coiled-coil is likely to remain the same as the insertion precedes the coiled-coil with no corresponding change to helix 3H. the central hinge between helices 2H and 3H is unchanged. the amino acid sequence shows a reduction in its predicted ability to form a coiled-coil. the hinge sequence preserves the register of the heptad repeat between helices 2H and 3H of the coiled-coil, allowing the formation of an extended, continuous helix across the whole length of this region. the conservation of the hinge in all known merlin-ERM proteins may explain the formation of homo- and heterodimers. the structure of the merlin CTD can be broken into two segments. on leaving the central coiled-coil, the CTD adopts a hairpin structure. this hairpin lies in the groove between FERM subdomains F1 and F3. this hairpin lies in the groove between FERM subdomains F1 and F3. there is no evidence that the isolated CTD forms an independently folded structure. it is likely that its structure is partially dictated by the protein to which it is bound. polyproline region At the end of the coiled-coil region is a polyproline motif in both (vertebrate) radixin and ezrin. polyproline regions often form left-handed polyproline type II helices (PPII helices) structural motifs are commonly used as interaction sites that bind proteins, DNA, as well as membranes. the helix is relatively open and extended, containing no internal hydrogen bonds. the helix lies in the groove between FERM subdomains F1 and F3, running anti-parallel to the subdomain F3 helix. there is a break in the electron density after Asp472, with the structure resuming with Glu486, which starts a strand packing against the outer sheet in subdomain F3 (Figure 4a, orange arrow against green arrow in F3) the interaction between the FERM and the CTD is mediated primarily by the burial of conserved hydrophobic side chains from helices within the CTD into conserved hydrophobic pockets of the F2 and F3 subdomains. the CTD has few intra-chain interactions, suggesting most of the structure forms upon binding to the FERM domain [61] the interaction between helix 3C and FERM subdomains F2 and F3 is more indirect. there is a water-filled cavity separating helix 3C from the FERM. there is a conserved hydrophobic interaction at the C-terminus of this helix. merlin isoform 2 (also known as isoform II), does not appear to code for helix 4C. it is not clear that merlin isoform 2 is capable of forming a FERM:CTD complex, distinguishing this isoform from the majority of merlin-ERM proteins. the region between the two adjacent membranes contains a dense, brush-like structure comprising ezrin molecules. the separation between the two membranes is consistent with the dimensions of the domain-swapped ezrin dimer. the dense, brush-like structure implies that ezrin dimers are self-associating laterally on the membrane surface. interactions between merlin and moesin have been shown using affinity co-electrophoresis (ACE) [99] and moesin and ezrin have been co-immunoprecipitated from the epidermal carcinoma cell line A431 [100] the differential affinities between interacting domains of the merlin-ERM proteins hint at a mechanism for controlling heterodimerization. structures lack the central helical domain due to limited proteolysis during crystallization. however, both fractions result in almost identical FERM:CTD structures. the merlin-ERM proteins are also thought to exist in an open conformation whereby the merlin-ERM proteins do not interact. the closed monomer buries a number of residues known to be important for merlin-ERM protein\u2013protein interactions. the binding of the FERM domain to PI(4,5)P2 is thought to shift the equilibrium of ERM towards the open state. talin also includes a second ubiquitin-like subdomain, F0, at the N-terminus. the properties of F1 plus the F1-F2 linker and helix 1F2 in F2 are such that talin could potentially form a cloverleaf arrangement as per the other FERM domains. the clefts between FERM subdomains are labeled a, b and c. middle panel shows the electrostatic surface in the same view. the right panel is rotated 180\u00b0 about a vertical axis in the plane of the page. the merlin-ERM FERM domain is a defining feature of a large number of proteins whose biological roles include linking the cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane. there are two crystal structures of the FERM domain bound to PI(4,5)P2) mimetics, either IP3 or short chain PI(4,5)P2 mimetics. helix 1H lies along FERM subdomain F2 and it is part of the globular FERM domain. helix 1H adopts the same packing with respect to the FERM domain as seen in the structure of the full-length Sfmoesin. the length of the coiled-coil appears to be conserved for both merlin and the ERM proteins during metazoan evolution. the length of the coiled-coil has not changed during metazoan evolution. the length of the coiled-coil is likely to remain the same as the insertion precedes the coiled-coil with no corresponding change to helix 3H. the length of the hinge sequence is strictly conserved in all known merlin-ERM proteins. it preserves the register of the heptad repeat between helices 2H and 3H of the coiled-coil. it has been proposed that such an extended helix is the basis of the structure of the ezrin domain swapped dimer that has been determined at low resolution by SAXS. merlin-ERM proteins contain a C-terminal domain (CTD) that is shorter and more divergent in sequence than their corresponding N-terminal FERM domains when compared across the family. there are significant differences between merlin and the ERMs in this region. the C-terminal part of the CTD forms a flat, helical structure. there are four extended helices in this region (1C, 2C, 3C and 4C, Figure 3 and Figure 4d) merlin CTD is likely to adopt the same structure as the ERM CTD when complexed to the FERM domain. polyproline region At the end of the coiled-coil region is a polyproline motif in both (vertebrate) radixin and ezrin. this feature is surprisingly absent in vertebrate moesin. ribosomes can stall at consecutive prolines during translation. the PPII helix arises when all residues adopt backbone dihedral angles ( and) of approximately 75\u00b0 and 150\u00b0. the helix is relatively open and extended, containing no internal hydrogen bonds. there is no direct structural data on the polyproline tract/proline-rich region for vertebrate ezrin/radixin or mammalian merlin. vertebrate ezrin/radixin/radixin and mammalian merlins contain a left-handed PPII helix just after the coiled-coil domain. it is possible that the polyproline domain is an interaction motif for an activating kinase. this is likely to release the additional CTD strand from the outer sheet of subdomain F3. the proline-rich motif is at the end of the coiled-coil ( helical) region that is not expected to need a pause to aid folding. the alignment contains human merlin-ERM proteins and insect ERM (Sfmoesin) from S. frugiperda. radixin/radixin and mammalian merlins have a left-handed PPII helix just after the coiled-coil domain. the poly-histidine segment forms a single turn 310-helix (Figure 4a, single turn orange ribbon above subdomain F1, blue), while the following segment, 467VAERAD472 forms a left-handed PPII helix (Figure 4a) helix 1C has a conserved hydrophobic face that binds to a hydrophobic region on FERM subdomain F2. this is likely to release the additional CTD strand from the outer sheet of subdomain F3. the net result may be to facilitate membrane binding, particularly to PI(4,5)P2. conserved polar face of helix 2C forms conserved hydrophobic interactions with the interface between FERM subdomains F2 and F3. helix 3C comes into close proximity with the portion of the CTD connecting the -strand to helix 1C. conserved phenylalanine (ezrin\u2014Phe583; merlin\u2014Phe592) that slots into the hydrophobic core of subdomain F3. conserved salt bridge between ezrin Arg579 (merlin Arg588) and FERM ezrin Glu244 (merlin Glu260) anchoring helix 4C to subdomain F3. co-immunoprecipitation experiments have shown that ezrin oligomers form in cells [77,90], and dimeric ezrin has been purified from placental tissue [91,92]. small-angle X-ray scattering studies of purified ezrin dimer have shown that it largely adopts a domain-swapped dumbbell structure [56] ezrin and merlin have a higher affinity for the ezrin FERM than for the merlin FERM. ezrin FERM preferentially binds ezrin CTD over merlin FERM. moesin and ezrin have been co-immunoprecipitated from epidermal carcinoma cell line. the FERM\u2013CTD interaction is responsible for the formation of both the closed monomer and dimer states of ezrin. the structures lack the central helical domain due to limited proteolysis during crystallization. however, both fractions result in almost identical FERM:CTD structures. a conformational change in the FERM on binding lipid may cause the release of the CTD. there is no high-resolution data describing an isolated, full-length open form. some protein\u2013protein interactions would only occur when the interactions between the FERM and CTD are broken and the open form must occur in cells. merlin-ERM FERM binding partner integral membrane proteins include: CD44, CD43 (also known as leukosialin), ICAM-1, ICAM-3, PSGL-1, neprilysin and membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) the mouse moesin FERM has a 37 residue cytoplasmic tail that contains a FERM binding motif. a second FERM binding region in the same peptide then binds along the groove between FERM subdomains F1 and F3. the structure of the bound peptide mimics a portion of the. merlin-ERM FERM domain also binds soluble proteins, often recruiting them to the membrane-cytoplasm interface. the scaffolding protein EBP50, also known as NHERF1, binds to the FERM domain by displacing the final helix (4C) of the CTD. DCAF1 possesses an acidic C-terminal tail which binds to the merlin FERM domain. two regions from the DCAF1 tail bind to FERM either as a single strand to subdomain F3, extending the sheet at 5F3, as per the majority of membrane protein cytoplasmic domains. however, all of these interactions would be blocked in the closed state of the appropriate merlin-ERM protein. merlin-ERM proteins undergo a myriad of post-translational modifications. phosphorylation is the most studied post-translational modification observed in the merlin-ERM family of proteins. merlin-ERM proteins are well known to be the targets of numerous kinases. merlin-ERM proteins have been identified via high throughput proteomic studies. this residue is located at the C-terminus coiled-coil helix 3H, immediately prior to the polyproline region. it seems unlikely that the phosphorylation of this residue is affected by the polyproline region. merlin knockout NF2/ mouse embryonic fibroblasts showed phenotypic difference between WT and S10D transfection. unphosphorylatable S10A mutant also showed defects in cell migration and lamellipodia formation. ser10 is phosphorylated by all Akt (protein kinase B) isoforms in vitro and in vivo. this residue (equivalent to merlin Ser518) lies opposite the highly conserved 308MRRRK312 motif at the C-terminus of 1F3 in subdomain F3. phosphorylation of ser518 would likely destabilize the FERM\u2013CTD interaction. however, studies assessing this are conflicted. merlin Ser518 lies directly opposite one of the most conserved regions in all merlin-ERM proteins: 308MRRRK312 at the C-terminus of 1F3 in subdomain F3. the two phosphorylatable threonines are proximal to the highly conserved and functionally important salt bridge (merlin Glu260\u2013Arg588; ezrin Glu244\u2013Arg579; Section4.4) studies of ser518 mutants reveal complicated biological lipid binding is the sole contributor to the regulation of FERM\u2013CTD interaction in merlin [70]. phosphorylation is an important switch in the regulation of the Hippo pathway. Merlin is a known upstream activator of the Hippo pathway kinases Lats 1/2. it functions by binding Lats 1/2 and recruiting these kinases to the membrane. merlin isoform 1 is the most abundantly expressed isoform. the phosphorylation of Thr581 has been reported in numerous high-throughput mass spectrometry analyses of various cancer cell lines. however, it is not well characterized. the first two sites (ezrin Ser66 and Tyr270) are near the putative FERM:membrane interface. the remaining sites (ezrin Tyr291, Ser535 and Ser536) are at the FERM:CTD interface. merlin-ERM proteins contain a pair of phosphorylatable (usually threonine) residues that are spatially juxtaposed in van der Waals contact on the FERM:CTD boundary. in van der Waals contact lies a completely conserved threonine (merlin T576, ezrin T567, radixin T564 and moesin T558) on the penultimate helix (3C) of the CTD. phosphorylation has not been reported for the corresponding merlin residue Thr576 [115] for ezrin this residue has been reported to be phosphorylated in mouse by CDK5. this pair of residues is so highly conserved and associated with phosphorylation that they are conspicuous. there is now growing evidence that alternate phosphorylation mechanisms and/or secondary phosphorylation sites enable ezrin, radixin and moesin (along with merlin an ezrin T567D mutation induces the formation of striking membrane ruffles and tufts of microvilli on the cell surface. phosphorylation at this site may increase ERM protein affinity for PI(4,5)P2 and affinity for binding actin. however, it is not yet clear whether the increase in affinity for actin is due to a direct increase in binding affinity at the actin-binding site. the second conserved cysteine (merlin Cys300, ERM Cys284) lies at the center of the FERM:CTD complex. its side chain is buried within the core of subdomain F3 in the FERM:CTD complex. a motif centered around Cys117 of moesin is necessary and sufficient for specific S-nitrosylation via a stimulus inducible NO synthase complex. it is possible that such post-translational modifications would alter the FERM\u2013CTD interaction as merlin Cys133/ERM Cys117 lies directly beneath helix 2C of the CTD. acetylated sites are conserved across the whole merlin-ERM family. lysine 3, 35, 72, 79, 83, 139, 162, 209, 211, 237, 254, 306 and 458. ubiquitination and acetylation sites are conserved across the whole merlin-ERM family. the 475PPVY478 binding motif must be accessible for binding the WWP1. it is likely to be released from the FERM domain favoring an open form of ezrin. ezrin may act as an adapter protein recruiting further substrates for WWP1. a global proteome analysis for human gastric cancers also identified Lys438 in ezrin [149], human radixin Lys435, mouse radixin Lys83 [142] and moesin Lys165 [148]. the biological relevance of these modifications is unknown. phosphorylation is the most studied post-translational modification observed in the merlin-ERM family of proteins. merlin-ERM proteins possess multiple phosphorylation sites. phosphorylation is the most studied post-translational modification observed in the merlin-ERM family of proteins. there are at least 36 separate sites reported for moesin, 34 for ezrin, 15 for radixin and 11 for merlin. only two of these sites are observed at conserved sites in both merlin and at least two of the ERM proteins. ser10 is phosphorylated by protein kinase kinase A (PKA) in vivo. phosphomimetic mutant also showed defects in cell migration and lamellipodia formation. most reported post-translational modification for merlin is phosphorylation at Ser518. le546 form an extended helix, elongating the first of the four helices at the C-terminus of the CTD (1C) the formation of an extended helix in this region differs from the ERM full-length model based on the crystal structure of Sfmoesin. this residue (equivalent to merlin Ser518) lies opposite the highly conserved 308MRRRK312 motif at the C-terminus of 1F3 in subdomain F3 merlin ser518 lies directly opposite one of the most conserved regions in all merlin-ERM proteins. this residue is a phenylalanine, preserving the aromaticity. merlin ser518 lies directly opposite one of the most conserved regions in all merlin-ERM proteins: 308MRRRK312 at the C-terminus of 1F3. phosphorylation of ser518 prevents angiomotin from binding merlin. the kinase PAK2 (a Rac effector kinase) inhibits merlin\u2019s FERM kinase activation. the kinase PAK2 (a Rac effector kinase) is a kinase kinase kinase. merlin isoform 1 is also phosphorylated at Thr581, which is located at the C-terminus of the penultimate helix, 3C, in the CTD. it bears the closest relationship to the ERM family and all invertebrate merlins. merlin isoform 1 is the most abundantly expressed isoform. much of this data has been reported by large high-throughput mass spectroscopic analyses. there is currently little data of the specific role of each phosphorylation site. the first two sites (ezrin Ser66 and Tyr270) are near the putative FERM:membrane interface. tyrosines 116, 146, 354, 424, 478, 483 and 499, threonines 332, 425 and 539, and serines 74, 384, 407, 429, 527, 576, tyrosines 116 and 556 and threonine 425. only one unique site in radixin has been highly reported. a completely conserved threonine (merlin T576, ezrin T567, radixin T564 and moesin T558) on the penultimate helix of the CTD. phosphorylation of this second threonine has been reported across numerous species and all three ERM paralogs. phosphorylation at residue equivalent to ezrin Thr567 has been observed. phosphorylation at this site may increase ERM protein affinity for PI(4,5)P2 [134] and affinity for binding actin. it is not yet clear whether the increase in affinity for actin is due to a direct increase in binding affinity. merlin Thr477, ezrin Thr468, moesin/radixin Ser468) residue is located at the C-terminus coiled-coil helix 3H, immediately prior to the polyproline region. it seems unlikely that the phosphorylation of this residue is affected by the polyproline region. the most reported post-translational modification for merlin is phosphorylation at Ser518. it has been observed in human, mouse and rat proteins. the most reported post-translational modification for merlin is phosphorylation at Ser518. length model based on the crystal structure of merlin Ser518. this residue (equivalent to merlin Ser518) lies opposite the highly conserved 308MRRRK312 motif at the C-terminus of 1F3 in subdomain F3. phosphorylation of ser518 would likely destabilize FERM\u2013CTD interaction. merlin Ser518 lies directly opposite one of the most conserved regions in all merlin-ERM proteins. e) Conserved ERM threonine (ezrin Thr576 but Ala585 in merlin; yellow) and merlin Thr581 (but conserved ERM arginine, ezrin Arg572, red) the two phosphorylatable threonines are proximal to the highly conserved and functionally important salt bridge small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) data indicate that in presence of PI(4,5)P2, WT merlin adopts an open conformation whilst the S518D mutant is closed. it has been proposed that lipid binding is the sole contributor to the regulation of FERM\u2013CTD interaction in merlin [70]. merlin isoform 1 bears the closest relationship to the ERM family and all invertebrate merlins. merlin isoform 1 is the most abundantly expressed isoform. the phosphorylation of Thr581 has been reported in numerous high-throughput mass spectrometry analyses of various cancer cell lines. the first two sites (ezrin Ser66 and Tyr270) are near the putative FERM:membrane interface. the remaining sites (ezrin Tyr291, Ser535 and Ser536) are at the FERM:CTD interface and phosphorylation may weaken the FERM\u2013CTD interaction favoring the open form. only one unique site in radixin has been highly reported (tyrosine 55) moesin has numerous highly phosphorylated residues including serines 74, 384, 407, 429, 527, 576, tyrosines 116 and 556 and threonine 425. phosphorylation of the second threonine is associated with activation of ERM proteins, i.e., the separation of the FERM and CTD domains. for ezrin this residue has been reported to be phosphorylated in mouse by CDK5 [129]. phosphorylation at the residue equivalent to ezrin Thr567 induces the formation of striking membrane ruffles and tufts of microvilli on the cell surface. an ezrin T567E mutation has been shown to increase membrane tension, slow migration, and impede endothelial transmigration of lymphocytes in vivo in mice. merlin Cys133, ERM Cys 117 is located in subdomain F2 in a loop joining -helices 2F2 to 3F2. the second conserved cysteine (merlin Cys300, ERM Cys284) lies at the center of the F3 -helix, 1F3. S-nitrosylation is a ubiquitous post-translational modification of cysteines. it is emerging as a principle mechanism for nitric oxide (NO)-mediated signal transduction critical for cellular function. only two ubiquitinated or acetylated sites are conserved across the whole merlin-ERM family. lysine 3, 35, 72, 79, 83, 139, 162, 209, 211, 237, 254, 306 and 458 are conserved. the majority of these sites arise in the FERM domain. ezrin was reported to interact directly with the E3 ubiquitin ligase WWP1 via the 475PPVY478 consensus motif. it is not clear whether ezrin phosphorylation is absolutely necessary for WWP1 ubiquitination. ezrin may act as adapter protein recruiting further substrates for WWP1. Succinylation is reported to occur on ezrin Lys60 [148] and a global proteome analysis for human gastric cancers also identified Lys438 in ezrin [149], human radixin Lys435, mouse radixin Lys83 [142] and moesin Lys165 [148]. the biological relevance of these modifications is unknown. aDP-ribosylation of these three arginine residues is likely to disrupt the structure of the FERM:CTD complex. also, the ADP-ribosylated CTD may not be able to interact with actin. ezrin is important for many pathogens entry into cells. merlin-ERM proteins bind PI(4,5)P2 through their FERM domain. ezrin binds more strongly to PI(4,5)P2 containing-vesicles than to other vesicles with similar charge. merlin-ERM proteins also interact with PI(4,5)P2 in vivo. two potential lipid binding sites, termed the \u2018pocket\u2019 and the \u2018patch\u2019, have been identified across the merlin-ERM family. both sites occur on the same face of the FERM domain, spanning the F1 and F3 subdomains. a mutation in merlin within the pocket (K79E) is associated with neurofibromatosis type 2. the coloring scheme is red for negative electrostatic potential through to blue for positive electrostatic potential. the orientation of these structures is consistent with panels (a) and (b) the overlays are in the same orientation as Sfmoesin FERM in Panel (b) merlin-ERM proteins may interact with PI(4,5)P2 using multiple binding sites. the full-length Sfmoesin crystal structure shows that two sections of the CTD obscure the putative membrane-binding sites. the region just after the central helical domain passes over the pouch and pocket sites. the binding of full-length ezrin is more entropically favorable than that of the ezrin FERM domain [165]. SANS experiments have suggested both ezrin and merlin form elongated monomers in the presence of PI(4,5)P2 [127,167]. the extent to which ERM proteins shape membranes determine curvature is unclear. phosphomimetic mutant, T567, can self-associate so as to tether PI(4,5)P2 containing membrane vesicles to each other forming stacks of lamellar vesicles. interactions with microtubules allow merlin-ERM proteins to control cellular shape and structure. interactions with tubulin are discussed in Section 8.2 and Section 8.3. indirect associations may also contribute to co-localization. merlin-ERM proteins also interact with PI(4,5)P2 in vivo. kinesin-1 and cytoplasmic dynein as candidate transporters. neomycin binds PI(4,5)P2 effectively reducing the concentration in the membrane. merlin-ERM proteins bind to just the polar head group of PI(4,5)P2 through their FERM domain [58,155,159,162] molecular dynamics simulations of moesin FERM indicate both sites could bind the membrane simultaneously. the lipid-binding sites on the Sfmoesin FERM domain in the same orientation and coloring as per (a) a recent crystal structure of the merlin FERM domain bound to a PI(4,5)P2 short chain derivative showed the lipid can bind a nearby region between the F2 and F3 subdomains. this region was termed the \u2018pouch\u2019 and is different to previously identified pocket and patch sites. this data suggests merlin-ERM proteins may interact with PI(4,5)P2 using multiple binding sites. a strand, 1C runs across the face of the membrane-binding surface. a coiled-coil of the helical domain points into the membrane, which is unphysical. binding of PI(4,5)P2 causes a more open merlin-ERM monomer structure. merlin-ERM membrane localization is not just dependent on lipid binding, but also involves interactions with other proteins. the presence of PI(4,5)P2 increases the affinity of both ezrin and merlin for the cytoplasmic tails of their integral membrane protein partners. ezrin dimers lie perpendicular to the membrane plane, forming a dense, brush-like structure through self-association on the membrane. neither WT or T567D ezrin were enriched on PI(4,5)P2 containing membranes with negative curvature and bind ezrin. imetic mutant (equivalent to ezrin T567D) showed significant reduction in binding microtubules. the constitutively open truncation mutant experiences a >30-fold increase in binding. this result suggests there is a steric masking of the binding site even post-phosphorylation of Dmoesin Thr559 (equivalent to ezrin Thr567 phosphorylation) these characteristics are unique to merlin and the ERM proteins that separate them from each other. merlin and the nucleus Merlin shuttle between the plasma membrane, the cytoplasm and the nucleus while the ERM proteins do not enter the nucleus. merlin must be equipped with both nuclear import and export sequences. the structure of this region has not yet been resolved experimentally. it is not clear what secondary structure it possesses. this region is predicted to be a consensus nuclear export sequence (NES) for exportin 1 recognition. full-length ezrin does not bind F-actin in co-sedimentation assays. the actin-binding site is occluded when the FERM and CTD domains interact. to activate actin binding, the FERM and CTD need to dissociate. o-electron microscopy studies have shown that both WT and the phosphomimetic T567D ezrin will form a brush-like coat on PI(4,5)P2 containing vesicles. but only vesicles coated with T567D bind to F-actin, which is consistent with the charged phosphomimetic mutation destabilizing the FERM\u2013CTD interaction. merlin has an experimentally determined non-canonical nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence within the F1 subdomain of the FERM (24VRIV27) [173] and three functional nuclear export signals (NESs) these NLS/NESs are unique to merlin and do not appear to be present in ERM proteins. the structure of this region has not yet been resolved experimentally. it is not clear what secondary structure it possesses. this region is predicted to be a consensus nuclear export sequence (NES) for exportin 1 recognition. full-length ezrin does not bind F-actin in co-sedimentation assays. to activate actin binding, the FERM and CTD need to dissociate. an alanine mutation at this site significantly decreases the interaction affinity of the FERM:CTD. phosphomimetic T567D ezrin will form a brush-like coat on PI(4,5)P2 containing vesicles. however, only vesicles coated with T567D bind to F-actin. this is consistent with the charged phosphomimetic mutation destabilizing the FERM\u2013CTD interaction. the merlin FERM domain is able to bind to actin indirectly by interacting with both II-spectrin and -fodrin. the only full-length high-resolution structure is that of the insect ERM Sfmoesin in the closed monomeric state. this may be difficult to obtain, as such a structure may only exist transiently in isolation. structural differences between merlin and merlin-ERM families appear subtle. FERM:CTD complexes are also near identical (Figure 4c) merlin FERM:CTD complexes are also near identical (Figure 4d) a large number of putative and confirmed post-translational modifications on the merlin-ERMs are likely to alter the stability of either the FERM:CTD complex or the electrostatic FERM:membrane interaction. some of the complexes result in binding-partner peptides covering the very surfaces of the FERM domain that would have been exposed on removal of the CTD. merlin and radixin have a complex set of isoforms. the majority of alternative isoforms replace the merlin-ERM C-terminus by one that is five residues shorter and more hydrophilic than that of the major isoform 1, which has a normal merlin-ERM C-terminus. the structural consequences of the radixin extension are difficult to predict. evolution may have duplicated the primordial merlin-ERM switchable interaction hub. merlin and the ERM proteins separated near the origin of metazoa, approximately 0.5 billion years ago. merlin and the ERM have set up a set of coordinate axes in the cell. merlin and the ERMs have preserved specific binding to some as yet unidentified partner protein complex(es) that require the preservation of their structural features. merlin and the ERM proteins are two sides of the same coin, functioning as a unit by directly interacting with each other."}
