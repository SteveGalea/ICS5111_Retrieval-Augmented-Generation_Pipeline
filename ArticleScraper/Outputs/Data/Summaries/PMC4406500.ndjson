{"summary": "influenza virus is an enveloped virus with single-stranded negative-sense RNA. its two major surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are highly expressed during viral infection and serve as targets for immune detection. HA1 is the most abundant protein on the viral surface and displays epitopes that trigger neutralizing antibody production. aptamers have been developed for a wide range of purposes such as biosensors, medical diagnosis, and therapy [16,17]. aptamers have been developed for a wide range of purposes such as biosensors, medical diagnosis, and therapy [16,17]. using counter-SELEX, the Polisky group created an RNA aptamer that could distinguish between theophylline and caffeine, differing by only one methyl group [19], while the Famulok group made aptamers asymmetric PCR reactions (100 L) were set up with a molar primer ratio of 100:1 (forward primer:reverse primer), and contained 0.2 mM dNTPs, 1 M forward primer, 10 nM 5\u2032-phosphorylated reverse primer, 10 nM template, and 2.5 U Taq DNA polymerase. the mixture was thermally cycled 20 times at 95\u00b0C for 1 min, 52\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 45 bead/opponent protein-bound DNA was precipitated and discarded. the pre-cleared supernatant was collected and incubated with 2 g target protein (GST-H1-HA1) in 100 L binding buffer for 30 min. aptamers were 5\u2032-biotinylated by asymmetric PCR using the forward primer 5\u2032-Biotin-GCAATGTACGGTACTTCC-3\u2032 followed by lambda exonuclease digestion. wells were washed four times with PBST (0.1% Tween 20 in PBS; pH 7.4) and incubated with various concentrations of purified GST-H1-HA1 in PBS at room temperature for 1 h. teON XPR36 (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) was used with PBS (pH 7.4) at 25\u00b0C. concentrations of 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 5, and 10 M H1-HA1 protein in PBS were run across the surface in horizontal orientation at a flow rate of 100 L/min for 60 s. the presence of G-quadruplex structures in aptamers was predicted by quadruplex-forming G-rich sequences (QGRS) Mapper. each spectrum was an average of three scans at room temperature. each spectrum was an average of three scans at room temperature. asymmetric PCR reactions were set up with a molar primer ratio of 100:1 (forward primer:reverse primer), and contained 0.2 mM dNTPs, 1 M forward primer, 10 nM 5\u2032-phosphorylated reverse primer, 10 nM template, and 2.5 U Taq DNA polymerase. after PCR, purified dsDNA was incubated with 25 U of lambda exonuclease (NEB, Frankfurt am Main, 2 g of the opponent protein (GST-H5-HA1) was incubated with 100 L of glutathione agarose beads in 100 L of binding buffer for 30 min at room temperature with occasional shaking. the synthetic ssDNA library was denatured by heating at 95\u00b0C for 10 min and immediately annealed on ice for 10 min. ssDNA was amplified by PCR, cloned into a linearized pGEM-T vector. aptamers were 5\u2032-biotinylated by asymmetric PCR using the forward primer 5\u2032-Biotin-GCAATGTACGGTACTTCC-3\u2032. wells were washed four times with PBST (0.1% Tween 20 in PBS; pH 7.4). GST-tagged HA1 protein was detected by adding 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) solution. the absorbance of each well was measured at 450 nm by using a TRIAD microplate reader. the membrane was washed, blocked with 5% BSA in PBST for 1 h. after four washes, the membrane was incubated with streptavidin-HRP for 1 h. bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system. HEK293T cells were harvested with trypsin-EDTA, washed three times with 1 mL of PBS, added to a pre-incubated protein-aptamer complex of 100 g GST-H1-HA1 protein and 8 g FITC-labeled aptamer. cells were washed, blocked with 1% BSA in PBS for 30 min, incubated with a phycoerythrin-conjugated local alignment search tool was used to compare the amino acid sequence similarity of H1-HA1 and H5-HA1. BLAST result showed that they have 55% identity and 73% similarity. ssDNA pools isolated after rounds 8, 10, 12, and 14 were tested for binding affinity. three aptamers were found to have high binding affinities to H1-HA1. the Kd values of ApI, ApI, and ApIII were 64.76 18.24 nM, 69.06 12.34 nM, and 50.32 14.07 nM respectively. immobilized biotinylated ssDNA aptamers were incubated with increasing concentrations of GST-H1-HA1. binding was detected with anti-GST antibody-HRP. ssDNA aptamers (500 ng/mL) were analyzed by western blot using aptamers. a western blot analysis was performed to determine whether the selected aptamers could be used as molecular probes for H1 protein recognition. the selected aptamers comprise of characteristic clusters of nucleotides in the 45-nucleotide random sequence region (indicated by asterisks) we also found that the G-rich sequences were located in the large major loop (ApI, ApII, and ApIII) as well as in the hairpin regions (ApII and ApIII) selected aptamers have shaded nucleotides representing the 45-nucleotide random sequence region. sequences identified by ClustalW2 indicated by asterisks and underlines, and shown in (A) as solid lines. HEK 293T cells incubated with aptamer-protein complexes containing GST-H1-HA1 or GST-H5-HA1 as analyzed by flow cytometry. the distribution of proteins (column) and selected aptamers (row) are shown. ssDNA pools isolated after rounds 8, 10, 12, and 14 were tested for binding affinity. ssDNA pools isolated after rounds 8, 10, 12, and 14 were tested for binding affinity. ssDNA pool was incubated with H5-HA1 (negative control) and centrifuged to remove H5-HA1-binding ssDNAs. enriched DNA was PCR-amplified, cloned, and sequenced. binding was detected with anti-GST antibody-HRP. 100 nM GST-H1-HA1, GST-H5-HA1 or GST proteins incubated with biotinylated aptamers incubated with streptavidin-coated plates. affinities of the selected aptamers were also measured by SPR technology. Fig 4 shows that the band intensities increased as the amount of H1-HA1 protein increased. the selected aptamers were bound to the H1-HA1 protein in a dose-dependent manner. a western blot analysis was carried out using whole cell lysates. the G-rich sequences were located in the large major loop (ApI, ApII, and ApIII) as well as in the hairpin regions (ApII and ApIII) the exact binding structure is still unclear, but the G-rich sequence might be involved in the interaction with H1-HA1. FITC-labeled aptamers were bound to the sialic acid-binding region of HA1. aptamers were found to bind selectively to H1-HA1 and not to H5-HA1. the aptamers did not interfere with the sialic acid-binding ability of HA1 regardless of the subtype. ssDNA pool of 88-mers was screened using counter-SELEX to isolate ssDNA aptamers binding specifically to H1-HA1 protein, but not to H5-HA1. after 14 cycles of selection, we were able to select three ssDNA aptamers and measure their binding affinities to H1-HA1 by ELISA and SPR. further analysis by western blotting demonstrated that the selected aptamers could be used as substitute for aptamers have G-rich sequence clusters in the 45-random nucleotide region. the structure of the selected aptamers was analyzed by CD. a stable G-quadruplex structure of selected aptamers has a strong binding capacity to a target protein. our selected aptamers did not block the interaction between H1-HA1 protein and the receptor of the host cell. therefore, our selected aptamers are not expected to inhibit HA-mediated membrane fusion. this is important to determine the HA subtype present in infected species. the gel was stained with Coomassie brilliant blue. the western blot was performed using GST antibody-HRP. the purified HA1 proteins have hemagglutination activity.
