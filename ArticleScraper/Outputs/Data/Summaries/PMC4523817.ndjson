{"summary": "the interferon (IFN) system is one of the most important natural defenses of mammalian cells in the early phase of viral infection. eukaryotic cells are equipped with various defense mechanisms to detect and respond to viral infections rapidly. a number of viruses have been shown to induce the formation of SGs in infected cells. hepatitis C virus, poliovirus, semliki forest virus, and mammalian orthoreovirus promote the shut-off of cellular proteins and the assembly of SGs at the early phase of infection. two RNA viruses, respiratory syncytial virus and coronavirus, are also known to utilize SGs as part of the machinery to inhibit cellular protein translation SGs were not detected during infection by influenza A virus (IAV); however, a recombinant IAV lacking non-structural protein 1 (NS1) effectively induced the formation of SGs and the production of IFN- in a PKR-dependent manner. RNA species produced during the course of RNA viral replication, such as mRNA, dsRNA, and 5\u2032-triphosphate (5\u2032-ppp) RNA. recombinant viruses of Sendai virus (SeV) generate dsRNA in infected cells at levels similar to production of IFN-. previous studies also reported that copyback (cb)- and internal deletion (id)-type DI genomes, respectively, preferentially associated with RIG-I and strongly induced the production of IFN-. all of the SeVs, even the WT of strain Z and Hamamatsu (HMT), used in this study were recovered from cDNA using a reverse genetics technique. all of the SeVs, as well as virulent and avirulent Newcastle disease virus (NDV) Miyadera and D26 strains were propagated in embryonated chicken eggs. polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) against whole virions of SeV and NDV were described previously (Kiyotani et al., 2005, 2011; Irie et al., 2008b, 2012). pAbs against the SeV P and C proteins were kindly provided by Kato. RNA Preparation HeLa cells were infected with the indicated viruses at an MOI of 5. At 24 h p.i., total RNA was prepared using the High Pure Viral RNA Kit (Roche Diagnostics) qRT-PCR samples were analyzed using the Eco Real-Time PCR System (Illumina) the viral proteins in the lysates were removed by high-speed centrifugation. supernatants were harvested from the final immunoprecipitation samples. supernatants were then subjected to RNA preparation, as described above. the RNA probe was designed to be complementary to the region of 14,761\u201315,384 in seV genome RNA. after FISH, some samples were further subjected to fluorescent immunodetection using the indicated antibodies. polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) against whole virions of SeV and NDV were described previously (Kiyotani et al., 2005, 2011; Irie et al., 2008b, 2012). pAbs against whole virions of SeV and NDV were described previously (Kiyotani et al., 1990). RNA Preparation HeLa cells were infected with the indicated viruses at an MOI of 5. at 24 h p.i., total RNA was prepared using the High Pure Viral RNA Kit (Roche Diagnostics) qRT-PCR samples were analyzed using the Eco Real-Time PCR System (Illumina) immunoprecipitation HeLa cells cultured on glass coverslips were infected with the indicated viruses. the insoluble fraction was removed by high-speed centrifugation. supernatants were harvested from the final immunoprecipitation samples. the RNA probe was designed to be complementary to the region of 14,761\u201315,384 in seV genome RNA. after FISH, some samples were further subjected to fluorescent immunodetection. the relative amounts of IFN- mRNA in cells infected with the indicated viruses were determined by qRT-PCR. similar experiments were performed for a series of C-mutated SeV recombinants. the results are presented as bar graphs, similarly to (C) an infection by C\u2032/C(-) and V(- resulted in a slight increase in the number of granules. the fluorescence of the SeV antigen was not colocalized with that of the representative SG marker G3BP1 in the granules. strong correlations were observed between IFN- mRNA levels and percentage of granular structure-forming cells against infected cells. treatment of HeLa cells with IFN- did not induce G3BP1-positive granules. the formation of SG-like structures observed by SeV infection was triggered by SeV infection, but not by type I IFNs. a relationship may exist between formation of G3BP1-positive granules and induction of IFN- in the C recombinants. la cells were immunostained with anti-G3BP1 mAb together with anti-SeV, anti-NDV, or anti-SeV C pAbs. the C protein alone failed to inhibit the formation of granules in cells treated with arsenite as well as infected with NDV. the number of granules was slightly reduced in the C-expressing cells treated with arsenite (Figure 2A) most of the SeV strains including Z have been characterized by their strong ability to counteract the innate immune system. the CNT strain has been widely used as a virus that induces high levels of IFN- and SG-like structures. we compared the abilities of some SeV strains to induce IFN- and SG-like structures. total RNA samples prepared from virus-infected as well as arsenite-treated cells were able to induce the granules despite no formation of the granules by the CNT infection. total RNA samples prepared from cells infected with any of the IFN--inducing viruses were able to induce the granules as well as IFN- in HeLa cells. the relative ratio of the cbDI genomes to the genome-length viral RNAs were determined by qRT-PCR. the relative amounts of IFN- mRNA in HeLa cells infected with the indicated viruses were determined, as performed in (A) total RNA prepared from the post-immunoprecipitation samples of 4C(-) and NDV was still able to induce the granules as well as IFN-, but that of CNT lost these abilities. results indicated that major IFN--inducing viral RNA species produced in the cells infected with CNT was encapsidated cbDI genomes, whereas those for SeV-4C(-) and NDV were not. arrowheads in (B) indicate the sites of G3BP1-positive granules. signals of the J2 and RIG-I antibodies were amplified using a TSA kit. dsRNA fluorescent signals were absent in cells infected with IFN--inducing Z-WT as well as in those with the IFN--inducing strain CNT. dsRNA fluorescent signals were clearly observed in the cytoplasm of cells infected with IFN--inducing SeV-4C(-) and NDV with dispersed and granular distributions. infected cell samples were prepared without a protease treatment to exclude fully encapsidated viral RNA species. infected cell samples were stained with an RNA probe complementary to the 14,761\u201315,384 region of the (-)-sense viral genome RNA. fluorescence-positive cytoplasmic inclusions were observed in the 4C(-) as well as in the CNT-infected samples. ISH-positive inclusions of 4C(-)-infected cells suggest that the RNA species detected in the 4C(-) samples were not encapsidated. the inclusions suggest that the RNA species detected in the 4C(-)-infected cells were only partially, not fully, encapsidated, unlike the fully encapsidated, full-length, intact viral genomes. mutated seV recombinants and the parental Z strain were treated with or without sodium arsenite (A) mutated seV recombinants were treated with or without sodium arsenite (NaAsO2) and infected with the indicated virus were immunostained with anti-G3BP1 mAb. treating cells with arsenite markedly changed the localization to form SGs containing these proteins in nearly all cells. TIAR was mostly in the cytoplasmic structures, whereas a larger part of TIAR was still observed in the nucleus in the arsenite-treated cells. granular formation and IFN- mRNA levels among the viruses were not due to their different growing abilities. similar strong correlations were observed for a series of C mutant viruses that possessed single- to triple-amino-acid substitutions of highly conserved, charged amino acids within the C proteins. itive Granules We examined whether expression of the C protein alone and infection of the non-granule-forming SeV could inhibit the formation of granules. NDV, another prototypic paramyxovirus, could induce G3BP1-positive granules in nearly all cells infected with virulent as well as avirulent strains. small granules dispersed in the cytoplasm were induced by arsenite. small granules dispersed in the cytoplasm were induced by arsenite. the granules induced by the infection were apparently larger than those induced by arsenite. IFN- mRNA was not highly induced in cells infected with the SeV strains, except for CNT. CNT induced IFN- mRNA at a level 46-fold higher than that by Z. different levels of IFN- mRNA induced by the strains could not be attributed to differences in viral growth. percentages of G3BP1 granule-positive cells against total number of cells received total RNA samples prepared from HeLa cells treated with or without arsenite. the calculated P values were: arsenite, P = 0.49; Z-WT, P = 0.15; CNT, P = 0.031; 4C(-), P = 0.0023; NDV, P = 0.0055. we then examined the content rates of cbDI genomes, a potent ligand for RIG-I, against viral genome-length RNAs in the RNA samples used above. the CNT sample contained cbDI genomes at a level 15,700-fold higher than that in the Z-WT sample. the sample of 4C(-) contained similar levels to the Z-WT sample. we examined the subcellular distribution of unusual viral RNA species produced by 4C(-) and CNT. dsRNA was not detected by the anti-dsRNA antibody, J2. dsRNA was not detected by the anti-dsRNA antibody, J2. FISH samples prepared in (A) were immunostained further with an anti-SeV N mAb, anti-RIG-I pAb, or anti-G3BP1 mAb. signals for RIG-I were amplified using the TSA kit. infected with 4C(-) and NDV were co-stained with anti-RIG-I and anti-G3BP1 antibodies. unlike IAV, these granules did not colocalize with the viral antigen or viral J2-dsRNA. non- and Partially Encapsidated unusual RNA Species were Selectively Incorporated into avSG-Like and non-avSG-Like Inclusions. the FISH-positive inclusions observed in CNT-infected cells were no longer detected in the cells infected with the CNT-lowDI (Figure 6A) the FISH signals observed in the CNT-infected cells were considered as the cbDI genomes. the results suggest that fully encapsidated viral genomes were not detected, whereas non- or partially encapsidated viral RNA species were detectable in this system. viral RNA species harboring the 5\u2032-region of (-)-sense SeV genome RNA were produced in infections by IFN--inducing CNT and 4C(-), and were selectively formed into distinct cytoplasmic inclusions. inclusions in the 4C(-)-infected cells could be identified as avSGs, and may be the site to detect viral RNA by RIG-I, whereas those in CNT-infected cells were not a several types of unusual viral RNA species were found to be generated in cells infected with the IFN-inducing SeVs but not those with the IFN-non-inducing SeVs. one was a dsRNA (J2-dsRNA) that was detected by the anti-dsRNA antibody, J2 (type I in Table 1). a major advantage of our study is that the comparison can be performed within the context of the same viral species. the SG-like structures formed by 4C(-) were revealed to contain another type of unusual viral RNA species by FISH analysis. this now strongly suggests that the SG-like structures found in the 4C(-) infection are defined as avSGs. the 4C(-) virus was shown to induce apoptosis more quickly and severely in infected cells. it is unlikely that the type II RNA observed in the 4C(-)-infected cells has the ability of the trailer RNA to inhibit apoptosis and SG formation. cbDI genomes were recently identified as strong ligands for RIG-I. the type III RNA was identified as the cbDI genome. the process of detecting infections and subsequent induction of IFN- differed largely between 4C(-) and CNT. the cbDI genomes were more dominantly produced by SeV-CNT than by the other strains and C-recombinants tested. this unique property of CNT might be attributed to its C protein that possibly have a functional difference with those of the other SeVs. click here for additional data file.
