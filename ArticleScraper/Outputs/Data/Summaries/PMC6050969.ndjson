{"summary": "the ferret model is most widely recognized for its utility in infectious disease research, especially respiratory infections. a variety of human pathogens are known to naturally infect ferrets and often reproduce human disease better than mouse models. mediated gene targeting of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene to generate a transgenic ferret model of cystic fibrosis. the first reported ferret genomic bacterial artificial chromosome library (10) was used to develop a model organism to study X-linked, double cortin-related lissencephaly spectrum (11) commercially available antibodies for cross-reactivity with markers on innate and adaptive cell subsets and cytokines in ferrets has yielded limited success. commercial kits and immunologic reagents tested in the ferret model Product type and namea Specificity Clone Isotype Host Vendor Application Reference(s) Commercial kits and immunologic reagents tested in the ferret model. bioscience/Tonbo Flow cyt 18, 19 CD4 Ferret 02 IgG1 Mouse Sino Biological Flow cyt 18, 19 MHC-II Human L243 IgG2a, Mouse BioLegend Flow cyt 18, 19 MHC-II Human L243 IgG2a, IgM, IgG Ferret Poly Goat LSBio Flow cyt 18 CD59 Mouse AL-21 IgM, Rat BD monoclonal antibody against ferret B cell receptor light chain useful in distinguishing kappa versus lambda B cell responses (20, 21) ELISpot and flow cytometric assays have been developed to quantify isotypes of antibody-secreting cells (22), pan-B cells (CD20+, CD79+), and Ig+ B cells (18, 19) interleukin-7 receptor [IL-7R], and IL-15Ra) and others (CXCR4, CD140, IL-2, IL-21, and IL-4) reagents will facilitate efforts to establish immunologic assays to interrogate the innate and adaptive immune responses to infection and vaccination. ferret model will allow correlates of protection to be established after vaccination and infection in conjunction with transmission studies.
