{"summary": "as of 21 March 2017, 1,917 human cases have been reported to the world health organization. most zoonotic infections have occurred in the Arabian Peninsula. human disease ranges from mild or asymptomatic infection to a fulminant viral pneumonia progressing to severe respiratory failure and death. high levels of seropositivity and virus detection rates have been observed in dromedary camels in the Arabian Peninsula. dromedary camel populations of many countries outside the Arabian Peninsula are genetically identical or identical to those infecting humans. we report a descriptive serological and virological survey of MERS-CoV from west to east across the africa continent. it was conducted by sampling camels in burkina Faso, Ethiopia and moroco. it was designed so as to also assess the influence of the herd size, camel function and lifestyle on likelihood of MERS-CoV infection. young camels are let with non-lactating females for reproduction only. the contacts of adult males with young (less than 4 years-old) camels is not common. camel density increases from North to East Africa through the Sahelian strip. ological results in camels published in literature (hatched areas) and countries selected for the study i.e. burkina Faso, Ethiopia and Morocco (with thick borders) regions sampled by country with their farming specificities, the local ecoregions, and the estimated seropositivity and viral RNA detection rates by region. cross-sectional studies were carried out simultaneously in the three countries. samples were collected at farms (1,301 samples from 80 herds) and some at abattoirs (199 samples from 6 herds) in Ethiopia and Morocco (Table 1).

African ecosystems. the contacts of adult males with young (less than 4 years-old) camels are not common. camel density increases from North to East Africa through the Sahelian strip. the highest densities recorded in the Greater Horn of Africa. cross-sectional study was done between February and March 2015. blood (for serological analyses) and nasal swabs (for virological analyses) were collected from camels. blood samples were allowed to clot at room temperature and the serum extracted with a pipette. numbera and characteristics of camels sampled for a cross-sectional serological and virological surey on MERS-CoV, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia and Morocco February\u2013March 2015 (n=1,500 camels). country Region Tot Inds.

Colinearity index among variables explaining MERS-CoV seropositivity and viral RNA detection rates was also slightly collinear with a R2 of 0.20.

Region and age were slightly collinear with a R2 of 0.20. the lifestyle refers to whether the camel was sendentary, nomadic or had a mix of sedentary and nomadic lifestyles. the type refers to whether samples were taken, such as a farm or a slaughterhouse. each model depicts the variation of serological and virological status according to explanatory variables (age, country, region, sex, lifestyle, herd category, camel function) each model depicts the variation of serological and virological status (response variable: positive/negative results) seropositivity rates ranged from 85.1% (95% CI: 71.8\u201392.7) to 99.4% (95% CI: 95.4\u201399.9) and the viral RNA detection rates ranged from 0% (95% CI: 0\u20130) to 15.7% (95% CI: 8.2\u201328.0) in Morocco, seropositivity rates ranged from 48.3% (95% CI: 18.3\u201379.5) to 100% (95% CI: 100\u2013100) and viral camel's function had a significant effect (p-value = 0.01) with higher viral RNA detection rates observed in camels bred for milk or meat as compared with transport. probability of detecting virus RNA also decreased with increasing age (p-value = 0.06; Figure 3) and was higher in females than in males. a higher seropositivity rate was found in young animals compared with older animals. the role of camel density in shaping the large spatial scale (i.e. national) variation pattern in seropositivity is supported by the identification, at fine scale (i.e. herd), of a herd size effect on serological prevalence. higher seropositivity rate in females bred for milking could be related to high viral RNA detection rates in younger animals. a plausible hypothesis could be that young camels who lack antibodies have a high probability of being infected. males are often separated from the herd and have thus less contacts with other camels. the results of our study are coherent with risk factors highlighted by alraddadi and colleagues for human illness in Saudi Arabia. they show that direct exposure to dromedary camels and particularly milking camels was significantly associated to MERS-CoV illness. study by deem et al. (2015) in Kenya did not identify the factors associated with variation of seropositivity among farms. such data contribute to understanding factors contributing to MERS-CoV infection in camels, which in turn might have an effect on zoonotic infection."}
