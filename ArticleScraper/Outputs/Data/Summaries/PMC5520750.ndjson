{"summary": "in healthy neurons, tau protein is enriched in the axon. tau accumulation in the cell body due to disruption of the AIS barrier is potentially a contributing factor to AD pathogenesis. aging causes altered neuronal protein expression, axonal atrophy, and some gliosis. fish 344 rats are a good model to recapitulate factors of human aging. aging causes alterations in AIS integrity and tau mislocalization. aging may represent events that contribute to aging as a strong risk factor for AD. the AIS is a selective diffusion barrier separating the axonal compartment from the somatodendritic compartment. the establishment of the AIS creates a filter that regulates intracellular traffic based on protein size or the type of motor proteins carrying cargo along microtubules. a single previous report showed that some structural proteins in the AIS are reduced with age in wild-type mice. saline perfusion followed by 200 ml phosphate buffered 4% paraformaldehyde. the brains were postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h. the gelatin block was cut into 40-m-thick coronal sections. mM sodium orthovanadate, 10 mM sodium fluoride, and 1 mM tetra-sodium pyrophosphate decahydrate were cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation at 22,000 g for 20 min at 4\u00b0C. the samples were then diluted in Laemmli buffer and heated to 95\u00b0C for 10 min. lysate samples were separated using SDS-PAGE on 3-8% Criterion XT Tris-Acetate in XT buffer (Bio-Rad) gradient gels at 150 V. the blots were stained with Ponceau S [0.04% (w/v) Ponceau S (#P3504, Sigma), 0.1% (v/v) acetic acid] for 5 min followed by 2 5 min washes in 5% acetic acid (v/v) the membranes were washed in TBS and 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated in appropriate species-specific IRDye 680RD or 800CW secondary antibodies. signal intensities for AIS proteins or tau are expressed as a ratio to GAPDH signal intensities. mount of 480-kDa (A) and 270-kDa (B) isoforms of AnkG do not change between young, middle, and old rats. other isoforms of AnkG not analyzed are isoforms that are not AIS-specific. avidin/biotin blocking kit (Vector Labs SP-2001) was used to block endogenous avidin in the gelatin matrix. nonspecific antibody binding was inhibited by incubating the tissue in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. tissue was rinsed (6 10 min in 0.5% TBS-Tx) and incubated for 2 h in dilution buffer. a one in six series of tissue sections (n = 6/group) was used for the immunofluorescent labeling of tau. all tissue was stained simultaneously in staining dishes using the same reagents. nonspecific antibody binding was inhibited by incubating the tissue in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. a hemisphere probe with a radius of 11 m was used to sample sites throughout the HP. a 4 objective was used to outline each region and a 60 oil objective lens (1.35 numerical aperture) was used for all stereological counts. image stacks were acquired of neurons in each HP region (CA1, CA2, CA3 and the dentate gyrus) using acquisition settings in the linear range of fluorescent intensity without saturation of tau signal. the same acquisition settings were used for all animals. intensity of somatic tau (using Tau7, a total tau antibody) in neurons in the CA1, CA2, CA3 and dentate regions of the HP shows no change with advancing age. no change in the regional intensity of tau is detected in the axon-enriched strata of the HP. six animals per age group (n = 6) were used to obtain fixed tissue. five or six animals per age group were used for fresh brain homogenate. all animal studies were performed in accordance with standard regulations. containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (10 g/ml pepstatin, 10 g/ml leupeptin, 10 g/ml bestatin, 10 g/ml aprotinin, 1 mM PMSF, 10 mM -glycerophosphate, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 10 mM sodium fluoride, and 1 mM tetra-sodium pyr leupeptin, 10 g/ml pepstatin, and 10 g/ml pepstatin pulverized at 65\u00b0C. lysate samples were diluted in Laemmli buffer and heated to 95\u00b0C for 10 min. blots were stained with Ponceau S [0.04% (w/v) Ponceau S (#P3504, Sigma), 0.1% (v/v) acetic acid] for 5 min. the membranes were washed in TBS and 0.1% Tween 20. the membranes were visualized with a LI-COR Odyssey infrared imager. signal intensities for AIS proteins or tau are expressed as a ratio to GAPDH signal intensities. Amount of 480-kDa (A) and 270-kDa (B) isoforms of AnkG do not change between young, middle, and old rats. the other isoforms of AnkG not analyzed are isoforms that are not AIS-specific. the tissue was rinsed in 0.1 M TBS, pH 7.4, containing 0.5% Triton X-100 (TBS-Tx) six times for 10 min each. the tissue was then incubated in 3% H2O2 in TBS-Tx for 1 h at room temperature. staining was developed using 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (D5637, Sigma) solution (50 mg/ml, 0.5% TBS-Tx, and 0.003% H2O2) for 12 min. tissue was rinsed, mounted on microscope slides, and coverslipped with CYTOSEAL 60 (#8310-16, Thermo Scientific) stereology The spaceballs stereological probe is an unbiased and systematic stereological sampling method to estimate the total length of a population of fibers in 3D space. it was used to quantify AIS length in the HP of rats. a box (8-12 m2) was drawn as large as possible inside the somatic compartment of each neuron, excluding the DAPI-positive nuclei. the mean value of fluorescence intensity was measured for each box within a total of 180 cells/animal/group. Optical density measurement of tau immunofluorescence in the somata and axons of HP neurons shows no changes with advancing age. intensity of tau (using Tau7, a total tau antibody) in neurons in the CA1, CA2, CA3 and dentate regions of the HP shows no change with advancing age. significance between age groups was determined using one-way ANOVA. significance was set at p 0.05. if no overall significance was achieved, no post hoc analyses were used. we also probed blots with the R1 tau antibody, a pan-tau rabbit polyclonal antibody (F(2,12) = 0.7686, p = 0.4852; Fig. 1G) and found no aging-related changes. tubulin was analyzed to measure the amount of microtubules as a control since tau is a microtubule-associated protein. stereological assessment of AIS length and morphology Stereological analysis of the AIS length showed no differences in the total length of all AISs in the HP across age groups. a small but significant change was detected in the volume and diameter of CA2 neurons when comparing young and old animals. the measured length of the AIS in HP neurons was 32.86 1.99 m in young, 32.33 1.379 m in middle, and 31.53 1.361 m in old aged animals. the total length of AISs in the HP estimated with the spaceballs stereology probe is unchanged across age groups. in the CA regions did not show an age-related difference. analysis of tau intensity in HP strata enriched in axonal projections did not detect any change with age. no changes were detected between aged groups. additional AnkG protein bands were detected at 190 kDa that did not change with age. these represent other canonical isoforms that are not specific to the AIS. blots were probed with SMI-312, an axon-specific neurofilament antibody. tubulin was analyzed to measure the amount of microtubules. there was no change in III-tubulin across age groups. blots were probed for GFAP, a protein previously shown to change in HP lysates of aging rats. a small but significant change was detected in the volume and diameter of CA2 neurons when comparing young and old animals. the measured length of the AIS in HP neurons was 32.86 1.99 m in young, 32.33 1.379 m in middle, and 31.53 1.361 m in old aged animals. dentate gyrus of the HP at ages 4 (E), 14 (G) and 24 (I) months showed no change. Optical density measurements of tau levels in somata and axonal layers showed no change across age groups. the axonal enrichment of tau may deteriorate during the pathogenesis of AD. aging may lead to the discovery of previously unappreciated anomalous features. we evaluated age-related changes in tau and the AIS. a single study assessed the aging changes in the AIS and showed changes in ankyrin and spectrin proteins using Western blottings of aged mice. the discordant findings could be due to the use of rats instead of mice, the methods used to immunoblot ankyrin or the increased specificity of antibodies currently available. stereological analysis of the AIS was conducted using two complementary approaches. the space balls probe is an established methodology for detecting aging-related changes in fiber structures within the brain. the space balls probe showed a lack of age-related changes in AIS length and only a mild region-specific decrease in width and volume. rat was not an appropriate model of aging to use for this study. we included age groups that span the spectrum from young (4 months), middle (14 months) and old (24 months), which is near the end of the normal lifespan and a time at which aging-related impairments in memory and cognition occur. reviewers should present AIS and Tau data separately for each individual hippocampal region, including images and analyses for each. authors should conduct these measurements in the axonal compartment Discussion 1. Discuss findings by Baalman et al (2012). techniques to demonstrate that normal ageing is not associated with large alterations in the composition or morphology of the axon initial segment (AIS), nor with large changes in somatic tau. the data presented in Figures 2 and 3 would be much stronger if presented separately for all individual regions of the hippocampus (i.e. CA1 vs CA3 vs DG) study examined whether aging affects AIS and tau distribution in Fischer 344 rats. authors found that axon initial segment (AIS) structure, AIS protein levels, the distribution of tau in neurons of the hippocampus, and total tau or phospho-tau protein levels were not different. the author missed some numbers before \u2018mths\u2019. in Fig 2G-I, what dose different color line mean."}
