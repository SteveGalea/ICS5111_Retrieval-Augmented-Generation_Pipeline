{"summary": "the world health organisation estimates that in 2012 the global case detection rate for TB was 66%. of the estimated 8.6 million incident cases that year almost 3 million cases were not diagnosed and notified [1]. smear microscopy is the primary test used for the diagnosis of pulmonary TB endemic countries. the GeneXpert requires consistent electricity and laboratory temperatures maintained under 30\u00b0C. cost of cartridges, instrumentation and maintenance threatens its sustainability in the longer term. other technologies have been developed for TB diagnosis in microscopy centers in high burden countries and are currently undergoing evaluation. the titular enzyme, a recombinase, binds to oligonucleotide primers to form recombination filaments that can recombine with homologous DNA. the second enzyme, a single-stranded DNA binding protein, binds to the strand of DNA displaced by the primer, stabilising the D-loop that has formed and preventing the dissociation of the primer. RPA probes are constructed with an abasic nucleotide analogue within the probe sequence. this abasic site is recognised and cleaved by several types of endo- or exonucleases. different nucleases are added to the core RPA reaction mixture. optimal primer and probe sequences were identified. lyophilized pellets of the TwistAmp Exo reactions contained primers and probe. double amounts of reagent were used for 100 L reactions. other bacteria including common respiratory pathogens were accessed from the reference collection of the Washington State Public Health Laboratory (Table 1). Crude genomic DNA extracts were prepared as described previously. Isolates marked * were supplied by the Mycobacteriology Unit, Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp, Belgium. all other isolates were from the Washington State Public Health Laboratory strain collection. study investigators were blinded to the status of the samples. panel comprised 121 specimens including induced and expectorated sputum (n = 119) and respiratory washes (bronchial and tracheal, n = 2). specimens screened by RPA TB assays were prepared as described earlier. each reaction contained 5 L of specimen extract added with rehydration buffer, MgOAc and molecular grade water to create a final reaction volume of 50 L. discarded remains of specimen collected for routine diagnostic examination. lyophilized pellets of the TwistAmp Exo reactions were prepared. for 50 L reactions, 4 L of 280 mM MgOAc, 37.5 L TwistAmp Primer-In-Pellet Resuspension Buffer and 8.5 L of sample/water were used. double amounts of reagent were used for 100 L reactions. crude genomic DNA extracts were accessed from the reference collection of the Washington State Public Health Laboratory (Table 1). Crude genomic DNA extracts were prepared as described previously. Isolates marked * were supplied by the Mycobacteriology Unit, Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp, Belgium. all other isolates were from the Washington State Public Health Laboratory strain collection. study investigators were blinded to the status of the samples. the panel comprised 121 specimens including induced and expectorated sputum (n = 119) and respiratory washes (bronchial and tracheal, n = 2). each processed specimen was used for DNA extraction. each reaction contained 5 L of specimen extract added with rehydration buffer, MgOAc and molecular grade water to create a final reaction volume of 50 L. IS1081 is present in all MTBC species and at a more stable copy number of 5\u20137 repeats per genome. primers and probes for both the IS6110 and IS1081 assays were selected based upon sequences described for the MTB H37Rv whole genome. the only difference between RPA primers and PCR primers is one of length, with 30\u201338 base oligonucleotides being optimal for the formation of efficient recombinase filament ten 35 mer primers were chosen at 5 base intervals (30 base overlap) upstream and downstream of target regions. primers that gave the best amplification of target DNA were then redesigned as a series of staggered primers with single base intervals deviating from the original primer sequence. a third and final round of primer screening was performed with different length (30\u201338 bases, varying at the 3\u2032 end) versions of the best primers. oligonucleotides chosen for amplification and detection of IS6110 and IS1081 are shown in Table 2. F = dT-FAM, H = tetra hydrofuran and Q = dT-Black Hole Quencher 1. sensitivity of the RPA reactions were assessed by testing serial dilutions of genomic DNA extracted from M. bovis BCG. fg 0.78 fg 1 fg 1.56 fg 3.13 fg 5 fg 6.25 fg 10 fg 12.5 fg 20 fg 25 fg 30 fg 40 fg 50 fg 100 fg 500 fg 1 pg 5 pg 10 pg 50 pg 100 pg 0.5 ng 1 ng IS6110 positive/tested 0/8 2/5 0/4 N/A positive controls using 500 pg DNA from either M. bovis BCG or M. tuberculosis H37Rv were used for each batch. no signals were obtained from the bacterial DNAs other than the MTBC strains. crude DNA extracts derived from cultured bacteria indicated no cross reactivity with RPA assay for any bacterial species. indirect smear microscopy was less accurate at 70.8% (95% CI: 81.7,93.2) and 95.4 (95% CI: 92.3,98.1). the IS1081 RPA assay detected 100% of smear positive TB samples. four NTMs were found smear positive but RPA negative. indirect smear microscopy and RPA IS1081 were more sensitive than indirect smear microscopy (91.4% (95% CI: 85,98.9) vs 86.1% (95% CI: 78.1, 94.1)) and also more specific (100% vs 88.6% (95% CI: 80.8, 96.1)) negative samples from culture confirmed TB patients were detected. four NTMs were found smear positive but RPA negative. an RPA assay was designed to target the insertion sequence, IS6110 [29], [30], a region that has been shown to have high sensitivity for diagnosing tuberculosis using PCR. oligonucleotides are typically 46\u201352 bases long, with a tetra-hydrofuran (THF) positioned 30 bases from the 5\u2032 end and 15 bases from the 3\u2032 end. the only commercially available phosphoramidite bases are dT and so the location of T nucleosides dictates the precise location of probes. y IS6110 and IS1081 are listed in Table 2.

DNA concentrations were measured prior to the preparation of serial dilutions for testing by RPA. the numbers of positive test results and the total number of tests run at each concentration of DNA are recorded. the specimen panel used to assess RPA assay performance was biased in its construction to reflect approximately 50% MTBC positive and 50% MTBC negative samples respectively. the remaining eleven cultures were further identified as NTMs. thirty-one specimens were culture negative and three cultures were contaminated. RPA IS6110 was more sensitive than indirect smear microscopy (87.5% CI: 81.7, 93.2) vs 70.8% (95% CI: 62.91, 78.75) and also more specific (95.4 (95% CI: 92.3, 98.1) vs 88% (95% CI: 83.6, 92.4)) the panel used 47 culture positive samples of which 35 were confirmed as MTBC via Accuprobe, and 12 as NTMs. the remaining 24 samples were culture negative. sensitivity and specificity of the IS1081 RPA assay were 91.4% (95% CI: 85,98.9) and 100% respectively. sensitivity and specificity of the IS6110 RPA assay were 87.5% (95% CI: 81.7,93.2) and 95.4 (95% CI: 92.3,98.1) respectively. the indirect smear microscopy was less accurate at 70.8% (95% CI: 62.91, 78.75) and 88% (95% CI: 83.6, 92.4) scopy negative 5 31 RPA IS1081 positive 32 0 RPA IS1081 negative 4 35 Testing pulmonary specimens (n = 71) by indirect smear microscopy and RPA IS1081 negative 4 35. the panel used 47 culture positive samples of which 35 were confirmed as MTBC via Accuprobe, and 12 as NTMs. smear positive TB samples were 96.8% and 2/5 (40%; 95%CI: 0,98.8) of the smear negative samples from culture confirmed TB patients were detected. the IS6110 RPA consistently detected 6.5 fg of genomic DNA. the IS1081 assay required slightly higher amounts of DNA 20 fg. culture positive 8/14 (57.1%) and 2/5 (40%) were identified as positives via the IS6110 and IS1081 assays. the volume taken for DNA extraction was only 0.25 ml, with just 5 L being used for each RPA assay. further work is required to optimize specificity of RPA for TB diagnosis. the optimal primer pairs chosen during each round of screening for IS6110 can detect both 50 and 500 copies of template. the optimal primers identified by shuffling these primers upstream and downstream in single base increments give faster detection times and result in higher levels of fluorescence."}
