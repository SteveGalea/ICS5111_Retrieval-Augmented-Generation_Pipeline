{"summary": "the interplay between autophagy and viruses has been investigated for more than 50 virus species in over 20 families of DNA or RNA viruses. the autophagy machinery is highly conserved from unicellular eukaryotes to metazoans. autophagy is likely also one of the most ancient cell-autonomous defense mechanisms to confront microbial invasion. RNA viruses Togaviridae Sindbis virus Mouse beclin 1 expression in Sindbis virus-infected neurons suppresses viral replication in the brain and reduces mouse mortality. mouse Atg5 Depletion or disruption of Atg5 impairs CNS clearance of Sindbis virus capsid and increases the mortality of infected mice. atg12, Atg18 Silencing these autophagy genes increases VSV replication in vivo and fly mortality after VSV infection. restrictive or non-functional alleles decrease sigma virus infectivity in flies. mouse beclin 1 HV68 carrying a vBcl2 variant fails to maintain latent infection in the spleen. virions and viral components can be captured and directed to autophagosomes for lysosomal degradation in a process called virophagy (a form of xenophagy). MHV employs nonlipidated LC3-I and ER-derived vesicles exporting short-lived ERAD regulators (EDEMosomes) to generate DMVs for viral replication. a cytopathogenic strain of BVDV incorporates an LC3 gene fragment into its genome and utilizes cellular Atg4B to facilitate the processing of the viral polyprotein precursor. autophagy can induce autophagy independently of viral replication. vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) induces autophagy via toll-7 recognition of VSV-G on the surface of virions. vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) induces autophagy via toll-7 recognition of VSV-G. studies are warranted to examine how plasma membrane disturbance caused by viral entry or syncytium formation between infected cells may function as danger signals capable of inducing autophagy. for some viruses, such as Sindbis virus (a message sense RNA virus in the alphavirus genus), viral replication is necessary for autophagy induction. viruses have developed potent strategies to antagonize autophagy. vaccinia virus disrupts autophagy by inducing aberrant LC3 lipidation and a direct conjugation between the autophagy proteins, Atg3 and Atg12 [24]. this scenario fails to explain the observation viral mutants unable to suppress autophagy do not have replication defects in many cell types in vitro. deletion of Atg5 in neurons in vivo increased susceptibility of mice to lethal central nervous system infection with Sindbis virus. but the ratio of replication-defective particles to replication-competent particles may be so high that autophagy deficiency fails to result in a detectable increase in viral replication. the protective role of autophagy against viral infection is strongly supported by in vivo studies using viral variants deficient in autophagy inhibition. -1 mutant lacking the ability to bind to Beclin 1 resulted in decreased mortality after intracerebral infection [25], decreased ocular disease after intracorneal infection [28], and decreased mortality after intravaginal infection [26]. autophagy functions as an essential component of host defense against many viral infections in vivo. recent studies have established that Sindbis virus nucleocapsids are selectively targeted for autophagic degradation by a mechanism that involves the well-known adaptor protein p62/SQSTM1 as well as a newly identified adaptor protein, SMURF1. p62/SQSTM1-Smurf1 pathway represents a novel ubiquitin-independent mechanism of selective autophagy during viral infection. autophagy inhibited the maturation of dendritic cells and their antigen presentation to CD4+ T cells. autophagy may also promote the presentation of endogenous viral antigens on MHC class I molecules. it is not yet known whether autophagy plays a more general role in class I MHC antigen presentation in viral infection. dendritic cells are defective in the processing and presentation of extracellular microbial antigens due to an impairment in phagosome-to-lysosome fusion rather than a defect in general autophagy [19]. a canonical autophagy-independent role has been shown for Atg5 in dendritic cell MHC class II antigen presentation. autophagy (or specific functions of autophagy proteins) can provide a negative feedback mechanism that reduces the magnitude and duration of innate responses to viral infection. a polymorphism in the autophagy-related gene, ATG16L1 (T300A), is one of the Crohn's disease susceptibility alleles. autophagy-related proteins participate in type I interferon production by plasmacytoid dendritic cells exposed to VSV [49] and HIV-1 [50], likely through promoting the delivery of viral ssRNA to endosomal Toll-like receptors. autophagy also controls IL-1 secretion by targeting pro-IL-1 for lysosomal degradation. autophagy-independent antiviral activities of autophagy-related genes have been revealed in different experimental systems. these include the promotion of phagosome-to-lysosome fusion and mediation of the effects of IFN- on the disruption of MNV replication complexes. other recently identified autophagy-independent functions of certain autophagy proteins that may prove relevant to viral control include a role in the recruitment of immunity-related GTPases to pathogen-containing vacu autophagy upregulation may be novel promising approach to broad-spectrum antiviral therapies. vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) induces autophagy via toll-7 recognition of VSV-G on the surface of virions. autophagy induction triggered by viral glycoprotein-mediated fusion has also been observed during infection with two paromyxoviruses, measles virus and canine distemper virus. further studies are warranted to examine how plasma membrane disturbance caused by viral entry or syncytium formation between infected cells may function as danger signals capable of inducing autophagy. viruses have developed potent strategies to antagonize autophagy. vaccinia virus is thought to disrupt autophagy by inducing aberrant LC3 lipidation and a direct conjugation between the autophagy proteins, Atg3 and Atg12 [24]. autophagy, rather than interferon, may play a predominant role in controlling viral infection in postmitotic neurons. deletion of Atg5 in neurons in vivo increased susceptibility of mice to lethal central nervous system infection with Sindbis virus. but autophagy deficiency fails to result in a detectable increase in viral replication. hypomorphic expression of Atg16L1 resulted in increased mortality of mice infected with another alphavirus, chikungunya virus [31]. compared to wild-type HSV-1, the HSV-1 mutant lacking the ability to bind to Beclin 1 resulted in decreased mortality after intracerebral infection [25], decreased ocular disease after intracorneal infection [28], and decreased mortality after intravaginal infection [26]. recent studies have established that Sindbis virus nucleocapsids are selectively targeted for autophagic degradation. p62/SQSTM1 and SMURF1 both interact biochemically with Sindbis virus nucleocapsid in a ubiquitin-independent manner. p62/SQSTM1-Smurf1 pathway represents a novel ubiquitin-independent mechanism of selective autophagy during viral infection. a recent study of respiratory syncytial virus infection found disruption of autophagy inhibited the maturation of dendritic cells and their antigen presentation to CD4+ T cells. autophagy may also promote the presentation of endogenous viral antigens on MHC class I molecules and the activation of CD8+ T cells. it is not yet known whether autophagy plays a more general role in class I antigen presentation in viral infection. ICP34.5 has a unique function in dendritic cells that is not observed in fibroblasts or neurons. it blocks autophagosome formation in dendritic cells, leading to impaired antigen presentation to MHC class II loading compartments and decreased CD4 T-cell activation. autophagy proteins may function in distinct cellular membrane trafficking events to contribute to effective MHC class II presentation of endogenous and exogenous viral antigens. the termination of virus-triggered immune responses is often equally if not more critical than the initiation of such responses. one interesting example of this is the inhibitory role of ATG16L1 in Crohn's disease. autophagy-related proteins have been shown to negatively regulate innate immune activation through a direct interaction with essential signaling molecules. the autophagy machinery acts at different steps to limit the magnitude of inflammation. autophagy controls IL-1 secretion by targeting pro-IL-1 for lysosomal degradation. autophagy-independent antiviral activities of autophagy-related genes have been revealed in different experimental systems. these include the promotion of phagosome-to-lysosome fusion and mediation of the effects of IFN- on the disruption of MNV replication complexes. other recently identified autophagy-independent functions of certain autophagy proteins that may prove relevant to viral control include a role in the recruitment of immunity-related GTPases to pathogen-containing vacu a cell-permeable autophagy-inducing peptide restricts in vitro replication of several viruses, including HIV-1, Sindbis virus, chikungunya virus, and west Nile virus. autophagy upregulation may be a novel promising approach to broad-spectrum antiviral therapies. autophagy may help keep virally infected cells alive, allowing more prolonged replication. many of the biochemical functions of these complexes may be co-opted for use in viral replication. lipid droplets can be selectively degraded via autophagy to release free fatty acids. herpesvirus (KSHV) is a human -herpesvirus associated with multiple cancers. two autophagy suppressors in the KSHV genome have been identified. v-FLIP blockade of autophagy is thought to enhance proliferation of KSHV-infected cells. LC3, ATG4B, ATG7, ATG12, and beclin 1) significantly reduces HCV RNA replication and yield. some studies suggest an association between HCV replication (HCV RNA and components of the HCV replicase complex) and double-membrane vesicles that have autophagosomal markers. autophagy may promote DNA Virus Replication Hepatitis B virus (HBV) likely uses the core autophagic machinery to promote viral DNA replication. promotion of viral DNA genome replication by autophagy or the autophagy machinery is also observed during infection with two other DNA viruses. the in vivo phenotypes of Atg5 deficiency in Coxsackievirus B and HBV infection are due to defective autophagy or lack of other Atg5-dependent functions. IRGM may be a common target of RNA viruses that subvert autophagy. MHV employs LC3-I (the nonlipidated, nonautophagosome-associated form of LC3) and ER-derived vesicles exporting short-lived ERAD regulators. the knockdown of LC3 reduces DMV formation and viral replication; however, neither Atg5 nor Atg7 is required for MHV replication [20, 86]. recombinant cytopathogenic BVDV strain, JaCP, all carry full-length cellular LC3 gene insertion in the viral genome. LC3-specific processing of the viral polyprotein by the host LC3-specific protease Atg4B is essential for the processing of the viral protein and for BVDV replication. autophagy may help keep virally infected cells alive, allowing more prolonged replication. autophagy inhibition greatly reduces lipophagy and Dengue virus yield without affecting viral entry or translation. two autophagy suppressors in the KSHV genome have been identified, including viral Bcl-2 and v-FLIP. autophagy machinery is exploited for hepatitis C Virus Infection. different subtypes of HCV induce apparent accumulation of autophagosomes. NS4B, an HCV nonstructural protein, interacts with Rab5 and beclin. replication (HCV RNA and components of the HCV replicase complex) and double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) that have autophagosomal markers may also be used to generate double-membrane structures used as scaffolds in RNA virus replication. this strategy is not a unique feature of viruses in the family Flaviviridae. atg5 is required for Viral Replication and Pathogenesis in vivo. acinar cell-specific disruption of Atg5 dramatically reduces Coxsackievirus B3 replication in the pancreas. the precise mechanism of decreased viral replication is not fully understood. human IRGM was shown to interact with several core autophagy proteins. expression of these viral proteins is sufficient to induce autophagy. the genetic silencing of IRGM decreases measles-, HCV-, and HIV-1-induced autophagy and particle production. autophagy inhibition greatly reduces lipophagy and dengue virus yield without affecting viral entry or translation. autophagy inhibits autophagy-dependent processing of lipid droplets and triglycerides to generate FFAs, resulting in an increase in cellular -oxidation and ATP generation. best-studied viruses exploit components of the autophagy pathway to promote its replication. different subtypes of HCV (1a, 1b, and 2a) induce apparent accumulation of autophagosomes. NS4B interacts with Rab5 and Beclin 1/Vps34 and functions in autophagy initiation. this strategy is not a unique feature of viruses in the family Flaviviridae. porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus also induces an incomplete autophagy response. the viral replicase NSP2 partially co-localizes with LC3 [75] coxsackievirus B3 replication in the pancreas and decreases viral-induced pancreatic dysfunction. the precise mechanism of decreased viral replication is not fully understood but is postulated to result from reduced synthesis of viral genomic RNA due to a deficiency in the formation of compound membrane vesicles. murine cytomegalovirus inhibits the inflammatory cascade by Targeting the NF-B Essential Modulator NEMO/IKK for autophagic degradation. inflammatory signaling cascade activated during viral infection is thought to be key to pathogen elimination. another potential strategy that viruses may utilize to co-opt autophagy for their own benefit is to dampen the inflammatory cascade. the role of nonlipidated LC3 in MHV replication represents a novel autophagy-independent function. this finding underscores the need for caution in interpreting whether the autophagy pathway functions in viral replication based solely on observations of LC3 and viral protein colocalization. virology, autophagy, and novel autophagy-independent functions of autophagy proteins will improve our understanding of virology, autophagy, and novel autophagy-independent functions of autophagy proteins."}
