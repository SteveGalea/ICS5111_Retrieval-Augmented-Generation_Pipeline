{"summary": "hRSV is an enveloped pneumovirus in the paramyxoviridae family. up to 64 million reported cases of hRSV infection and 160,000 deaths occur each year. there are still no vaccines or effective antiviral drugs available. apoptosis may evade host inflammatory responses and premature death of host cells. recent reports suggest that SH protein activates the NLRP3 inflammasome (13) the availability of SH channel inhibitors would help further understanding the role of this channel activity in the viral life cycle of RSV. however, thus far no compound has been reported that is able to inhibit SH protein channel activity. iphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPhPC; Avanti Polar Lipids) in chloroform was mixed with 26 g of SH protein in methanol (molar ratio, 1,000:1) and dried under a N2 stream. 300 l of internal buffer (25 mM tetraethylammonium [TEA]-HEPES, 0.5 mM EDTA, 100 mM 25 l of potassium buffer (560 mM KCl, 25 mM TEA-HEPES, 0.5 mM EDTA, pH 7.5) was added. 4 l of a solution of 25% Triton X-100 (to obtain a 0.5% final concentration) was added. 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC)\u20131,2-di-(9Z-octadecenoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine (DOPS) were added on 70- to 90-m-diameter orifices. aqueous solutions of 1 M KCl were buffered with 5 mM HEPES at pH the current amplitude recorded in approximately 30 independent experiments, each one lasting 200 s, was averaged. the data were fitted to a single Gaussian to obtain the mean value of conductance (G) as a function of pH. the phospholipid bicelle system was composed of 1,2-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (or dilauroylphosphatidylcholine [DLPC]) and 1,2-dihexanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (or dihexanoylphosphatidylcholine [DHPC]) peptides were reconstituted into DHPC-DLPC bic NMR experiments were performed at 40\u00b0C (313 K) using Bruker Avance-II 700 and 600 NMR spectrometers equipped with cryogenic TXI probes. Sodium 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate (DSS) was used as the internal reference for 1H nuclei. d SH protein in DPC micelles (21). Chemical shift perturbations were monitored using [1H-15N] TROSY-HSQC spectra. NOE distance restraints were obtained from 15N NOESY-HSQC (mixing time, 150 ms) and 13C NOESY-HSQC (mixing time, 120 ms) spectra. all heavy atoms 0.93 0.23 Ramachandran analysis (%) Residues in most favored regions 72.9 Residues in additional allowed regions 0.8 Residues in disallowed regions 0.0 a i and j are the positions in the sequence of two given residues. 0.15 Ramachandran analysis (%) Residues in most favored regions 59.4 Residues in additional allowed regions 35.8 Residues in generously allowed regions 4.8 Residues in disallowed regions 0.0 a i and j are the positions in the sequence of two given residues. backbone hydrogen bonds of -helix are applied for regions confirmed to be -helix according to local NOE pattern. HEK293 Phoenix cells were transfected with the bicistronic mammalian expression vector pIRES-AcGFP1 (Clontech) single cells expressing AcGFP were selected by fluorescence microscopy and voltage clamped using the whole-cell patch clamp technique. both bath solutions were constantly bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. hasselbalch equation was used to calculate the amount of bicarbonate required to achieve the respective pH in the presence of 5% CO2. all experiments were carried out at room temperature using a perfusion system with a flow rate of 5 ml/min and a bath volume of 300 l. fluorescence was measured by fluorescence changes of the dye Asante potassium green-2 (APG-2; TEFLabs, Austin, TX) the assay conditions, e.g., lipid, protein-to-lipid ratio, fluorophore, buffer type, and pH (internal and external), were first tested in larger volumes. the potassium concentration outside the vesicles was increased to 140 mM by addition of 560 mM KCl, 25 mM TEA-HEPES, and 0.5 mM EDTA, pH 7.5. aliquot (75 l) of liposome suspension was placed in each well of a microplate containing 1 l of compound dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) DMSO was reconstituted in planar lipid bilayers formed by apposition of two monolayers prepared from a mixture of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC)\u20131,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE)\u20131,2-di-(9Z-octadecenoyl)-sn-glycer the potential was defined as positive when it was higher on the side of the protein addition (cis side), whereas the trans side was set to ground. an Axopatch 200 B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) was used to measure the current and the applied potential. lyophilized peptide was dissolved in sample buffer containing 4% PFO acid. gel was run at 80 V for 2 to 3 h with morpholineethanesulfonic acid. a 4.2% polyacrylamide gel was polymerized in a gel chamber having an inner diameter of 5.4 mm. after polymerization was complete, gels were washed in H2O overnight and then twice with sample buffer containing 20 mM sodium phosphate and 50 mM NaCl at pH 5.5. the gels were then completely dried at room temperature. 1H-15N heteronuclear steady-state NOEs were obtained by recording spectra with and without 4-s 1H presaturation at 700 MHz. chemical shift perturbations were monitored using [1H-15N] TROSY-HSQC spectra. structure statistics were used to refine the structure using the standard simulated annealing protocol. a total of 20 structures were calculated, and the structure statistics are summarized in Tables 1and 2.

vector pIRES-AcGFP1 coding either for AcGFP only or for both AcGFP and the full-length SH expressed as separate proteins. the pH 5.5 bath solution was composed of 124 mM NaCl, 3.5 mM KCl, 0.01 mM NaH2PO4, 0.3 mM NaHCO3, 25.9 mM sodium gluconate, 1.3 mM MgSO4, 2.5 mM CaCl2 and 10 mM d-(+)-glucose. both bath solutions were constantly bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 to maintain their a liposome-based fluorescence assay was used to screen for compounds that can inhibit SH channel activity by pyronin B. a concentration of 10 M pyronin B led to a 60% inhibition of channel activity. the effect of pyronin B was tested on RSV replication in vero cells. the conductance values were fitted using a standard sigmoidal dose-response curve to obtain a Kd of 6.8 M. effect of increasing concentration of pyronin B on RSV replication in vero cells. most of these juxtamembrane residues form a conserved motif in the RSV SH protein, A39ILNKL43. this suggests that this is a critical region for SH protein, where emergence of resistance mutations would be difficult for the virus. by comparison, residues at positions 6 and 21 are not conserved. the patchdock server (36, 37) performed first a blind docking search. pyronin B could explore the entire surface of SH protein. the ten best structures were selected according to the geometric shape complementarity score. pyronin B binding sites on the SH pentamer at the N-terminal (B) and C-terminal (C) ends of the TM domain are labeled in red. only two monomers of SH protein pentamer (i and i + 1) are shown for simplicity. intact C-terminal end of the TM domain (residues 38 to 41) is sufficient for inhibition. the conservative mutation A39S in that region almost completely prevented inhibition (10% inhibition) secondary structure of SH protein reconstituted in bicelles. comparison was performed using lipid membrane and detergent micelle environments. however, examples exist in the literature of the better suitability of bicelles over micelles in studying membrane protein structure. this broadening may be caused by the TM domain being more structured. the TM ends, juxtamembrane, and extramembrane parts of the SH protein were still observable. the cross-peaks are labeled by one-letter code and residue number. the region proposed as the pyronin B binding site (residues 38 to 43) showed identical C chemical shifts. however, dramatic differences were observed in the C-terminal juxtamembrane fragment Leu-44 to Asn-48. the total -helical content of SH protein is increased from 53% in DPC micelles to 60% in bicelles. this is almost identical to the percentage obtained using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) of SH protein reconstituted in DMPC membranes (21). pentameric TM model of severe acute respiratory syndrome-corona virus (SARS-CoV) E protein lipid environments confirmed in DPC micelles by solution NMR (48, 49) similar approaches were followed to obtain pentameric TM model of severe acute respiratory syndrome-corona virus (SARS-CoV) E protein lipid environments. forms tested showed mild but clear cationic selectivity (data not shown) at pH 3 all of these forms showed mild anionic selectivity (data not shown) at pH 7.5, H22F, H22F, and the double mutant H22F H51F showed lower cation selectivity, P+/P. differences in RP are likely to reflect structural changes induced by the H22F mutation. mutant H22A showed aberrant mobility and/or aggregation, suggesting a structural role. a dramatic reduction of channel activity at lower pH was also observed for synthetic SH-TM (residues 18 to 43) currents were elicited with voltage increments of 20 mV from 120 to +100 mV applied from a holding potential of 0 mV. currents were elicited with voltage increments of 20 mV from 120 to +100 mV applied from a holding potential of 0 mV. at pH 7.4, no differences were observed between currents measured in cells overexpressing SH protein and in control cells. no significant difference was observed in RPs between control and SH-expressing cells at pH 7.4 and 5.5. this observation points to the conclusion that SH expression did not modify the ion selectivity of the measured current. this effect could have been caused by cellular stress induced by SH expression, reducing the activity, expression, or membrane trafficking of the endogenous potassium channels. a liposome-based fluorescence assay was used to screen for compounds that can inhibit SH protein channel activity. a concentration of 10 M pyronin B led to a 60% inhibition of channel activity; conductance changed from 300 70 pS under control conditions to 120 60 pS in the presence of pyronin B. the conductance values were fitted using a standard sigmoidal dose-response curve to obtain a Kd of 6.8 M. the effect of increasing concentration of pyronin B on RSV replication in vero cells was calculated as the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) at the C-terminal end, the residue most affected was Ala-39 (Fig. 2B) and a group of nearby residues, i.e., Ile-40, Leu 41, and Lys-43 (Fig. 2C), located at the C-terminal end of the TM domain. most of these juxtamembrane residues (residues 38 to 43) form a conserved motif in the RSV SH protein, A39IL docking studies of pyronin B to the SH protein pentameric surface were performed. the patchdock server (36, 37) performed first a blind docking search. pyronin B was located near the residues that showed the largest chemical shift perturbation. only two monomers of SH protein pentamer (i and i + 1) are shown for simplicity. the main residues that showed largest NMR chemical shift changes are shown in red. effect of pyronin B on SH-TM was similar to full-length SH protein (40 and 60% inhibition, respectively) at 10 M, suggesting that the intact C-terminal end of the TM domain is sufficient for inhibition. however, the conservative mutation A39S in that region almost completely prevented inhibition (10% inhibition) cross talk between the two ends of the TM may lead to a modification of the pyronin B binding site at the C-terminal region, without affecting channel activity. however, examples exist in the literature of the better suitability of bicelles over micelles in studying membrane protein structure. spectra were collected at 313 K, pH 5.5, and the protein concentration was 0.3 mM. this broadening may be caused by the TM domain being more structured. the TM ends, juxtamembrane, and extramembrane parts of the SH protein were still observable. the cross-peaks are labeled by one-letter code and residue number. only small differences were present at the N-terminal extramembrane fragment. residues 1 to 7 were close to random-coil values, and the rest were more -helical. the region proposed as the pyronin B binding site showed identical C chemical shifts. comparison shows that Pro-58 is located at the tip of a C-terminal loop formed by the non-helical residues after His-51. the total -helical content of SH protein is increased from 53% in DPC micelles to 60% in bicelles, which is almost identical to the percentage obtained using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. orientation of the TM domains obtained in DPC micelles (21) was justified in the latter model. similar approaches were followed to obtain the pentameric TM model of severe acute respiratory syndrome-corona virus (SARS-CoV) E protein lipid environments. at pH 7.5, the RP of all the forms tested showed mild but clear cationic selectivity. in contrast, at pH 3 all of these forms showed mild anionic selectivity. results are from artificial membranes in presence of a 10-fold KCl concentration gradient. each reversal potential (RP) value represents the charge versus that of the WT SH protein at pH 3. differences observed in RP are likely to reflect structural changes induced by the H22F mutation. mutant H22A showed aberrant mobility and/or aggregation, suggesting a structural role. a dramatic reduction of channel activity at lower pH was also observed for synthetic SH-TM (residues 18 to 43) in planar lipid bilayers (20) currents were elicited with voltage increments of 20 mV from 120 to +100 mV applied from a holding potential of 0 mV. currents were elicited with voltage increments of 20 mV from 120 to +100 mV applied from a holding potential of 0 mV. at pH 7.4, no differences were observed between currents measured in cells overexpressing SH protein and in control cells. the switch to an acidic environment did not cause any obvious change of the current density-to-voltage relationship over a period of 10 min. the experimental RP was close to the equilibrium potential of potassium predicted by the Nernst law. thus, the ion channel activity of SH protein, if any, may have been masked by such current. expressed or did not accumulate at plasma membranes was tested by observing channel activity in HEK293 Phoenix cells overexpressing a FLAG-tagged (C- or N-terminal) SH protein. none of these conditions produced channel activity that could be attributed to SH protein in a whole-cell configuration. previous patch clamp data that showed low-pH activation of SH protein cannot be reproduced. inhibition is more easily rationalized here than near the N-terminal end (cytoplasmic) of the TM. inhibition is more easily rationalized here than near the N-terminal end of the TM. the role of histidine residues in SH protein channel activity has been observed in other viroporins, e.g., influenza virus M2 protein (61), SARS-CoV E protein (48), and HCV p7 (57) all of these viral channels contain narrow regions that probably serve as selectivity filters. the homologous sequences of RSV SH protein, bovine RSV, PIV5, and MuV suggest a role of a membrane-permeabilizing pentameric structure common to these species. a C-terminal His residue is present with a 3- to 4-residue periodicity, expected for -helices. the equivalent residue to His-22 is replaced with Phe in these homologous sequences, supporting a more structural role for this residue. small-molecule inhibitors can be used to probe the role of SH protein channel activity during the cell cycle. pyronin B compares favorably with the 16 M for amantadine inhibition of influenza virus M2 protein (55), the 10 M reported for hexamethylene amiloride (HMA) inhibition of SARS-CoV E (56), 50 to 100 M for rimantadine inhibition of HCV p7 (57) the TM domain (purple) predicted using TMHMM (64) and the C-terminal extramembrane His residues (blue) are highlighted. the juxtamembrane regions in membrane proteins are sensitive to the hydrophobic environment used experimentally, e.g., micelles versus bicelles. all of these viral channels contain narrow regions that serve as selectivity filters. ion selectivity in SH protein is poor, as also observed in other viroporins. ion selectivity in SH protein is poor. hRSV SH His-51 residues have a conserved His residue at or near the equivalent position to his-51 in hRSV. the equivalent residue to His-22 is replaced with Phe in these homologous sequences, supporting a more structural role."}
