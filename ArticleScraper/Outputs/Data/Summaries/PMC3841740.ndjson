{"summary": "clinical signs vary from none to severe, with most outbreaks occurring during the winter season. prevalence of BRSV infection at herd level, or in a population, is usually based on the detection of antibodies in serum or milk from a group of animals in the herd. most dairy calves will not have detectable maternal antibodies after the age of five months. BRSV status should be based on an investigation of animals chosen to classify the herds correctly as infected or not. the number of animals needed to classify the herds correctly will rely on several factors, such as the within-herd prevalence. a study by H\u00e4gglund and others (2006) suggested conducting such studies by using three animals in each herd. the 30 districts represented herds from 16 out of the 19 Norwegian counties. one cow-year is the sum of the total of individual feed days for all cows in a herd over the course of a calendar year divided by 365. the calves were aged 0\u2013365 days, and the animals were randomly selected at each sampling. this gave a total of 1348 blood samples collected from 1294 calves. out of the samples, 470 were from calves less than 150 days old. analysis for the presence of antibodies against BRSV was performed using a commercial ELISA kit (Svanovir, Svanova Biotech AB, Uppsala) the optical density (OD) was measured at 450 nm and corrected by subtraction of OD for the negative control antigen. the sample was classified as positive if one or more of the sampled calves were positive for BRSV antibodies. contingency analysis was performed with number of cow-years 50 and 50 as the independent variables and serostatus from sampling one to two as the dependent variables. the winter season is December, January and February, and the summer is June, July and August. seventy-four herds had winter between the two samplings, while 26 had summer. herds with 15\u201324.9 cow-years (n=1807), herds with 25\u201349.9 cow-years (n=568), herds with 50\u201399.9 cow-years (n=62); (4) herds with more than 100 cow-years (n=6). 134 dairy farmers were able to participate and were included in the survey. antibodies against BRSV in serum out of the number of calves tested Number of sampled calves Number of positive calves 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 2 10 0 7 3 14 6 4 5 4 28 13 5 4 5 5 85 11 4 3 2 0 6 11 6 4 0 0 0 0 1 1 2 7 5 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 2 7 5 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 2 positive herds were considered to have had the virus present in the herd during the past year. prevalence of positive herds was calculated for the first (n=134 herds) and second (n=117 herds) samplings. two dependent variables were analysed Change from negative to positive at herd level The number of positive animals tested=100 per cent versus 100 per cent. Relationships were deemed statistically significant if the P value was less than 0.05. a herd was classified as positive if at least one sampled animal was antibody positive BRSV, bovine respiratory syncytial virus. a herd was classified as positive if at least one sampled animal was antibody positive BRSV, bovine respiratory syncytial virus. larger herds were more likely to change status from positive to negative. the prevalence of herds defined as positive on first, second or both samplings was 82, 94, 64 and 75 per cent for each of the four counties. several counties had no positive herds (Fig 1, numbers 1, 2 and 6) total 117 54 21 27 15 54 Number of herds sampled and herds classified as negative for BRSV infection at both samplings (/) or both positive (+/+), herds defined as having a new infection (/+) or eliminating an infection (+/) BRSV, bovine respiratory syncytial virus Seasonal variation Of the herds with winter between samplings, the respective number equals 23 per cent (6 out of 26) if one or more of the sampled animals were positive for antibodies against BRSV, the herd was classified as positive. the prevalence of herds positive for antibodies in bulk tank milk was 30 per cent (14 of 46 herds) the within-herd prevalence of the positive herds varied from 10 per cent to 100 per cent. the mean number of animals sampled on each sampling occasion was 4.7. however, larger herds were more likely to change status from positive to negative. the number of herds tested and their distribution by county is presented in Table 3. the number of herds tested and their distribution by county is presented in Table 3. if one or more of the sampled calves between 150 and 365 days of age were positive for BRSV antibodies, the herd was classified as positive. the positive herds have most likely had BRSV circulation during the previous year. the within-herd prevalence in this study was low, compared to other studies. the main reason for false positive herds would be the cut-off value for maternal antibodies (150 days) it is possible that there are false positive herds due to calves with an unusually long duration of maternal antibodies. the lower the level of maternal antibodies, the less impairment. the lower the level of maternal antibodies, the less impairment. in the present study, the prevalence of BRSV in calves up to 12 months of age was low. the prevalence of BRSV is highly variable between counties. the counties with the highest cattle density generally had a higher proportion of positive herds, but no link was found between herd size and the risk of being classified as positive. there is a peak occurrence of BRSV infections in the autumn and winter. the fact that new infections occur throughout the summer could explain how the virus can survive between winter seasons. there is some uncertainty about these results as the samples were collected only every sixth month. a higher number of animals in each herd, and a higher number of herds in an area, are necessary. there are rapid shifts in infectious status at herd level."}
