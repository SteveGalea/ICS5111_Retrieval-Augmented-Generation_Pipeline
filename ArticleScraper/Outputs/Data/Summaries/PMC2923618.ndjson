{"summary": "we propose that the progression of cancer cells towards malignant phenotypes can be tracked using high-throughput technologies that follow the gradual changes observed in the gene expression profiles. Methods based on information theory can then quantify the divergence of cancer cells' transcriptional profiles from those of normally appearing cells of the originating tissues. new role of stemness as a hallmark change of cancer cells is supported by observation that poorly differentiated tumors show transcriptional profiles on which there is an overexpression of genes normally enriched in embryonic stem cells. other authors suggest different hallmarks, with many papers pointing alternative processes as their primary focus of their research. this research enriches the list of the most important cancer hallmarks. these physiological changes occur at a \u201clower\u201d molecular level. these physiological changes occur at a \u201clower\u201d molecular level. we start our quest assuming an implicit working hypothesis common to many research groups around the world. the macroscopic physiological changes (i.e. Hanahan and Weinberg's \u201challmark changes\u201d) must also correlate with global alterations of the molecular profiles of gene transcription. it is possible to find an objective mathematical formalism to infer the turning point at which these radical changes occur. it is then evident that computing the Jensen-Shannon divergences, the Normalized Shannon Entropy, and the Statistical Complexity of samples reveal different global transcriptional changes. the most important \u201challmark of cancer\u201d is the existence of a gradual \u201cprogression\u201d from a well-differentiated gene expression profile (corresponding to a healthy tissue) prostate cancer and melanoma are almost at the antipodes in terms of progression rates. pathological samples are common in autopsies of men as young as 20 years old. the clinical management of prostate cancer requires the identification of the so-called Gleason patterns in the biopsies. this data is available from http://microarray-pubs.stanford.edu/prostateCA/images/fig1data.txt and supplemen-tary material is also available from http://microarray-pubs.stanford.edu/prostateCA/. neither the Normalized Shannon Entropy nor the MPR-Statistical Complexity can help differentiate between tumor and normal samples. a mathematical interpretation of this result is that the samples from lymph node metastases have cells that not only varied their transcriptomic profile, they have also \u201cpeaked\u201d the distribution of expression values with significant fold increases on a smaller number of probes. we refer the reader to the \u2018Materials and Methods\u2019 section for an explanation of how these magnitudes are computed. in this dataset, normal tissue samples tend to have relatively lower MPR-Statistical Complexity values than tumor and lymph node metastasis. this means that both prostate cancer and metastases samples diverge from a \u201cmore uniform\u201d distribution indicating that the distribution \u201cpeaks\u201d in fewer active genes. this measure derives from being a general definition that allows accommodating several different reference states. taken as computed averages over normal samples, and respectively metastatic ones, these measures will allow tracking the processes of differentiation of a cancer cell from a particular tissue type. we call these two stastical mesured M-Normal and M-Metastases. they are directly proportional to the Jensen-Shannon divergences with the normal (and respectively with the metastatic) gene expression profile. most of the primary tumor samples appear as a transitional state between the normal and metastatic group. a gradual \u201cprogression\u201d occurs from the normal tissue specific profile to the metastases one. the only selection criteria was to single out the 5,153 probes whose expression varied most across samples. the authors say that the only selection criteria was to single out the 5,153 cDNAs whose expression varied most across samples. we have computed the correlation of the gene expression profile corresponding to each of the 5,123 probes. for each probe, we computed both the Pearson correlation (x-axis of Figure 3) and the Spearman correlation (y-axis of Figure 3) of each probe profile with the Jensen-Shannon divergence having as probability distribution of reference that of a metastasis profile. positive correlations with the Jensen-Shannon divergence from the average metastatic profile indicate a possible dysregulation of these critical processes for which these genes have key roles. the interpretation of these scatter plots is not immediate and needs an introductory explanation. each dot corresponds to a probe such that its pattern of gene expression (across all samples) is not correlated with the Jensen-Shannon divergence to the average profile of a metastasis pattern. CDKN2D (Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2D, p19, inhibits CDK4) one of the genes that has strong positive correlations is CDKN2D. a gene that shows a positive correlation with the divergence of a metastasis profile indicates a gene that has a putative reduced expression on these samples. loss of BRCA2 function is linked to poor survival in prostate cancer [55] and rare germline mutations have been associated with early-onset of prostate cancer. 85% of men who die of prostate cancer have bone metastasis [57] lamin A/C appears as a member of a set of genes with reduced expression for higher grade primary prostate cancer samples. we will not discuss in depth the known relationships between FOS, Lamin A/C and prostate cancer. a subset of prostate cancer cells may escape basal cell requirements through SOX9 expression. the high ranking of KLK3/PSA in our list is perhaps one of the most remarkable retrodictive outcomes of our approach. a search using PubMed using the keyword \u2018KLK3\u2019 reveals a total of 11,429 published papers. our results echoes a recent contribution by S. Miyano's on a massive meta-analysis of microarray datasets. melanoma \u2013 Haqq et al.'s dataset contains information of 14,772 cDNAs in 37 samples. the 37 samples include 3 normal skin, 9 nevi, 6 primary melanoma and 19 melanoma metastases. this dataset contains information of 14,737 probes and 37 samples. the samples include 3 normal skin, 9 nevi, 6 primary melanoma and 19 melanoma metastases. in this case, the Normalized Shannon Entropy does not help to differentiate the normal to metastatic progression. to compute the M-normal measure, we need to define the average gene expression profile for a normal cell (which we call M-skin the resulting measure that relies on this profile) the results are encouraging, as samples plotted in the (M-skin, M-metastasis)-plane cluster in groups, showing an important M-skin complexity transition between normal skin cells and nevi. pronounced gap between normal skin samples and the nevi, primary, and metastatic melanoma samples as revealed by the M-skin measure. this indicates that no information about the profiles of metastasis are used. however, increasing values of this measure may be linked with a 'progression' from nevi to primary melanoma profiles. we compute two Pave profiles, one with the normal skin samples only. the other with all the metastasis samples (regardless their type) we then compute the Spearman correlation of the profile of all gene probes in the array across the 37 samples to both JSM0 and JSM5. ADA (Adenosine deaminase), AA683578. the first probe that presents an opposite behaviour is one for ADA (Adenosine deaminase) a 5-biomarker panel included SPP1, Kashani-Sabet et al. used tissue microarrays on 693 melanocytic neoplasms to show that SPP1 expression collaborates significantly improving the detection of high percentage of melanomas arising in a nevus, Spitz nevi, dysplastic nevi and misdiagnosed lesions [253]. all normal skin samples, as well as nevi and a couple of primary melanomas have relatively low values of ADA but they express TP63. there is a change of roles in metastatic and some primary melanomas, which have reduced TP63 expression but increased values of expression of ADA. p63 is a key regulator of the development of stratified epithelial tissues. p63 expression is not reported in 57 out of 59 tumors in a tissue microarray study. it is clear that the role of loss of expression of TP63 in melanoma warrants further investigation. we observe a marked increase of expression of a probe for ADA with melanoma progression. at the same time we observe a loss of expression of a probe corresponding to DPP4/CD26 (Dipeptidyl-peptidase 4, CD26, adenosine deaminase complexing protein 2). ADA could potentially be downregulating DPP4 [133], [134]. dle check point proteins have a stem cell-like expression profile. it could be a common target for gastric adenocarcinoma [137], bladder cancer [138], colon cancer [139], [140], hepatocellular carcinoma [141], medullary thyroid carcinoma [142], esophageal cancer [143], pancreatic cancer [144] and in some types of non-Hodgkin lymphomas [145] and breast cancer [146]. tric carcinoma has promise due to lack of a reported measurable immune response of siRNA-based therapeutics [149]. less sensitivity to PLK1 depletion of cells with a functional p53 [150], [151], and can help to sensitize cells to chemotherapy. biomarkers for loss of cell adhesion, cell-cell communication and dysregulation of epithelial cell polarity. aNK1 (Ankyrin 1, erythrocytic), AA464755 was also singled out as by our Gene Ontology analysis as related to the maintenance of epithelial cell polarity. the use of another profiler of genome signatures (g:Profiler, [156] also reinforces the view that many genes that have lost expression are related to \u2018Epidermis development\u2019. a pattern of downregulation of gene expression is associated with an impairment of epidermis development and the maintainance of its structure. this process includes the loss of function of genes that are essential for the maitainance of tight junction and epithelial cell-cell communication. this process includes the loss of function of genes that are essential for the maitainance of tight junction and epithelial cell-cell communication.

SPP1 - secreted phosphoprotein 1 (osteopontin) SPP1 is one of the most conspicuous melanoma biomarkers [198], [199], [200], [201], [203], [204], [205], [206], [207], [208], [209], [211], [213], [218], [220], [221], [222] the first 200 gene probes recognized by GATHER have 27 gene probes associated with the Gene Ontology in terms of \u201ccell proliferation\u201d (p-value = 0.0002, Bayes Factor 5), and \u2018regulation of cell proliferation\u2019. other partners of PLK1 appear and their function in \u2018mitotic cell cycle\u2019 (p-value = 0.0003, Bayes Factor 5) is increasingly present (in particular, the M phase of the mitotic cell cycle) mitosis 7 m(BUB1 CENPF KIF23 PLK1 PTTG1 SHC1 STK6) 0.003 3 GO:0042127 [5]: regulation of cell proliferation 10 (CDC7 CHEK1 CXCL1 CXCL10 FLT1 FTH1 SHC1 SLAMF1 SPP1 WARS) g:Profiler has listed some of the genes gene associated to the M phase of mitotic cell cycle. these are: ARPC1B [252], ARPC2 (which, together with SPP1, is also in the novel 5-biomarker panel of Kashani-Sabet et al. [253]), BCCIP (BRCA2 and CDKN1A-interacting protein)/P21-and CDK-associated protein 1). FPRL1, LIG3/DNA Ligase 3 [304] may indicate a necessary condition for the mainainance of iron sequestration and suppression of reactive oxygen species accumulation [303]. FPRL1, LIG3/DNA Ligase 3 [304] may indicate a necessary condition for the mainainance of iron sequestration and suppression of reactive oxygen species accumulation. expression of 38 gene probes annotated with functions on cell proliferation. in green, the normal skin samples; in yellow, the nevi samples; the primary melanoma samples (in orange) show increased expression for most of these biomarkers. this may indicate that upregulation of genes involved in these processes is an earlier event. the remaining thirty one (31) samples were assayed with the GPL3834 (FHCRC Human Prostate PEDB cDNA Array v4) platform using 15,488 probes. we eliminated all the probes with missing values, remaining 13,188 probes. sample 02_003E and 03_063 seem to be outliers to this trend. in the case of 03_063 the sample is not even close to a hypothetical linear fit which seems to be the norm for all the samples. this may indicate a subsampled group of prostate cancer with Gleason 3 pattern characteristics but very low entropy. we have a dataset with 13,188 probes and 29 samples as our dataset for further analysis. both samples (02-003E and PNA_03-063A) are located closer to samples of Gleason patterns 3 and 5, indicating that there exists a subsampled subtype of prostate cancer. Figure 14 shows the distribution of the samples using the Normalized Shannon Entropy and the MPR-complexity. by definition, the positions of the 29 samples in the plane do not change. this figure is basically \u201czooming in\u201d one region of Figure 12 that contains these samples. we have plotted Spearman versus Pearson correlation values of probe expressions to try to find those that best correlate, either positively or negatively, with the Normalized Shannon Entropy values of the samples. the results have revealed some of the most relevant biomarkers of progression, and some unexpected newcomers. the gene that has the most negative correlations is CDKN2C (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2C - p18, inhibits CDK4 - NM_078626) it has been previously associated with the transition from prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia to prostate cancer. clorgyline, an irreversible MAO-A inhibitor, induced secretory cell-like morphology and repressed expression of cytokeratin 14, a basal cell marker. AMACR, Cyclin G2, CDK4 and CDK7 Other probes that also have high negative correlations with the Shannon Normalized Entropy correspond to CCNG2 (Cyclin G2) CR598707. two \u201ctumor suppressors\u201d BRCA1 and TP53 are linked to prostate cancer progression. TP53 and TP53 are expression, status and mutations. BRCA1 is one coregulator of AR, the androgen receptor [486], [487], [488], [489] and inhibits ESR1 (Estrogen receptor alpha) activity. Knockdown of BRCA1 results in the accumulation of multinucleated cells. one possible mechanism for gene silencing is CpG island methylation. y is SFPQ/PSF (Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein-associated splicing factor), a multifaceted nuclear factor [496], [497]. loss of expression of SFPQ and other proteins that together regulate androgen receptor-mediated gene transcription [500] may indicate they have a role not only as a biomarker of the progression and well as transitions of the disease to androgen independence. CD40 is a member of the TNF receptor superfamily. in 56 out of 57 archival prostate cancer samples Palmer et al. have reported no CD40 expression [518]. depletion of CD40 in the tumour microenvironment may be central in avoiding the action of the immune system [506], as prostate cancer induces a progressive suppression of the dendritic cell system [520]. it is perhaps a central piece which should be put together in the context of other pieces of information coming from immunotherapy [508], [512], [513], [516] and pharmacological studies [507] that warrant serious investigation. Xu et al. obtained CD59 mRNA levels were determined by real-time PCR in matched (tumor/normal) microdissected tissues from 26 cases. they found an upregulation in 19.2% (five cases), although the general rate of CD59 transcript was significantly lower in tumor tissue. LMNA (Lamin A/C), AY528714. function of nuclear processes such as chromatin organization, DNA replication, cellular integrity and transcription. LMNA act as an intrinsic modulator of ageing within adult stem cells via a mechanism where LMNA act as signalling receptors in the nucleus. dysfunction of LMNA leads to inappropriate activation of self-renewal pathways. pRB needs to be stabilized by LMNA for INK4A-mediated cell cycle arrest. LMNA colocalizes with c-FOS at the nuclear envelope, b) suppresses AP-1 through a direct interaction with c-FOS. LMNA has also been proposed as an inhibitor of adipocyte differentiation. XBP1 expression was localized in epithelial and adenocarcinoma cells of the prostate. majority of refractory cancer cases exhibited weak XBP1 expression. MST1/STK4 (along with MST2/STK3) act as inhibitors of endogenous AKT1. the first 38 genes in the ranking include 33 that have the regulatory motif V$NFKB_Q6_01 (GATHER reports for this list a p-value of 0.0006) 58 of them have the regulatory motif V$NFKB_Q6_01, with p-value = 0.003. the group of 58 biomarkers contains one of particular interest, STAT6. this gene is considered a survival factor in prostate cancer. this gene is a key regulator of the genetic transcriptional program responsible for progression. prostate cancer \u2013 Lapointe et al.'s dataset (File S1) The first dataset is the one from Figure one in Lapointe et al. [44] the authors used a cDNA microarray technology that allowed them to measure gene expression of several thousand genes on 112 samples. from that set, a subset of 5,153 probes were selected as differentiating prostate cancer samples from normal and metastases. the Normalized Shannon Entropy of prostate cancer tumor samples do not differ much from normal samples. this is in contrast to lymph node metastasis samples that appear to have smaller values of Normalized Shannon Entropy. y correlate well with the transition between normal samples with to ones with metastases. but it is also evident from that normal samples do not differentiate much from the tumor group. it is then not the number of genes with high expression values, but the change in the distribution of expression levels on the molecular profile, that could distinguish these other samples. two new statistical complexity measures have the same functional form as the MPR-Statistical Complexity. instead of computing the Jensen-Shannon's divergence from a uniform probability distribution we compute it against an ad hoc probability distribution functions derived from the data. the relevance of this measure derives from being a general definition that allows accommodating several different reference states. axis, the lymph node metastases have the largest values of M-Normal indicating a divergence from the normal profile. the M-metastases values of normal samples tend to be higher than most of the metastasis samples. the results presented in Figure 2 shows that the prostate cancer samples are clustered on a particular confined area between the two other groups. if we assume that the 5,153 probes singled out by Lapointe et al. in their figure one of Ref. [44] have been selected with a supervised method that try to distinguish between normal and metastases, then the relative position of normal and metastases samples is perhaps something to be expected. the metastases samples have a clear reduction on Normalized Shannon Entropy. at the same time, metastases samples have higher M-normal complexity than the normal samples. it is then interesting to evaluate the value of the Jensen-Shannon divergence of these samples. positive correlations with the Jensen-Shannon divergence from the average metastatic profile indicate dysregulation of these critical processes for which these genes have key roles. the interpretation of these scatter plots is not immediate and needs an introductory explanation. each dot corresponds to one probe of the array. we have found which is perhaps the most famous biomarker in prostate cancer KLK3/PSA (Kallikrein-related peptidase 3), probe G_914588 (correlations of 0.9312 and 0.9000 respectively) FOS and KLK3/PSA are the second and fourth most negatively correlated probes in this ranking of all the genes in the microarray. the loss of BRCA2 function is a warning sign of the existence of error prone cell processes. 85% of men who die of prostate cancer have bone metastasis. the high rank of FOS was unexpected, but perhaps it is less of a surprise for some experienced researchers in prostate cancer. we will leave this discussion for later, as Lamin A/C will appear in our study of the other prostate cancer dataset studied in this paper. c-Fos accumulation within the extraction-resistant nuclear fraction (ERNF) and its interaction with lamin A are reduced and enhanced by gain-of and loss-of ERK1/2 activity. SOX9 (SRY)-box 9) processes that link SOX9 upregulation to cancer development. the high ranking of KLK3/PSA in our list is perhaps one of the most remarkable retrodictive outcomes of our approach. it is perhaps the best blood biomarker for prostate cancer screening. a search using PubMed using the keyword \u2018KLK3\u2019 reveals a total of 11,429 published papers. nadir (nPSA) levels (p.0001), longer doubling times on relapse (p =.006) and significantly lower rates of local (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.47, 95% confidence interval [0.30\u20130.75], p =.0014) and distant failure (HR: 0.25[0.13\u20130.46], p.0001) and death due to any cause (HR: 0.37 [0.23\u20130.60], p.0001). the depletion of FOXM1 still allows cells to enter mitosis. this leads to mitotic catastrophe or endoreduplication. it has been recently shown that the depletion of FOXM1 still allows cells to enter mitosis. close to 85% of men who die of prostate cancer have bone metastasis. the successful metastatic process to bone follows from the activation of osteoclasts with bone resorption. this leads to the release of different growth factors from the bone matrix. Ivorra et al. have proposed that lamin A/C-mediated c-Fos sequestration at the nuclear envelope is a novel mechanism of transcriptional and cell cycle control. c-Fos accumulation within the extraction-resistant nuclear fraction and its interaction with lamin A are reduced and enhanced by gain-of and loss-of ERK1/2 activity. an increased value of SOX9 expression in prostate cancer has been associated with a putative subgroup of prostate cancer [82], associated to lymph-node metastasis. the high ranking of KLK3/PSA in our list is perhaps one of the most remarkable retrodictive outcomes of our approach. patients with a PSA value 0.2 ng/mL are unlikely to develop biochemical relapse. biomarkers of interest warrant further investigation for patient population stratification after initial treatment. a gene expression dataset from Haqq et al. contains information of 14,772 cDNAs in 37 samples. 37 samples include 3 normal skin, 9 nevi, 6 primary melanoma and 19 melanoma metastases. this dataset contains information of 14,737 probes and 37 samples. the two types of melanoma metastases they identified are presented with different color coding. we will show that the modified statistical complexities M-skin and M-metastasis allow visualizing a clearer transitional pattern. in this melanoma dataset, neither the use of the Normalized Shannon Entropy nor the MPR-complexity helps to discriminate between normal skin, nevi, primary and metastastic melanomas. melanoma metastases were classified as \u2018Type I\u2019 and 14 as \u2018Type 2\u2019. this means that now the Pave profile will not be obtained by averaging over the 19 metastases samples, but instead using only the 14 samples which have been labelled as \u2018Type II\u2019. melanoma samples from the normal skin profile have a low value of the M-skin measure. most of the primary and metastatic samples have even larger values of M-skin. this may indicate that a further heterogeneity may exist in this subgroup, a fact that warrants further study. we compute the Spearman correlation of the profile of all gene probes in the array across the 37 samples to both JSM0 and JSM5. the results are provided as Haqq-PLoSONE-SupFile.xls, in the sheet labelled \u2018Results-correlation\u2019. expression of this probe has a relatively high negative correlation with the Jensen-Shannon divergence of the normal skin type. the first probe that presents an opposite behaviour is one for ADA (Adenosine deaminase), AA683578. a 5-biomarker panel included SPP1, Kashani-Sabet et al. used tissue microarrays on 693 melanocytic neoplasms to show that SPP1 expression collaborates significantly improving the detection of high percentage of melanomas arising in a nevus, Spitz nevi, dysplastic nevi and misdiagnosed lesions [253]. we will now discuss three of these genes in the context of current biological knowledge on all the samples that have TP63 expression are normal or nevi. the trend reverses for the rest of the primary melanomas and the metastatic ones. TP63 belongs to the same protein family of its more famous relative, TP53. p63 expression is not reported in 57 out of 59 tumors in a tissue microarray study. ADA is a gene involved in cell division and proliferatation. it has been suggested to have a regulatory role in dendritic cell innate immune responses. a variant of benign melanocytic nevus can mimic the vertical growth phase of nodular malignant melanoma. ADA could potentially be downregulating DPP4 [133], [134]. elicitation of complementary role of these two biomarkers is necessary. PLK1 has a high value of (negative) Spearman correlation with the values of the Jensen-Shannon divergence of samples with the average metastatic profile. in 2002 Kneisel et al. conducted a study to investigate the expression of PLK1 in very thin melanomas (smaller or equal to 0.75 mm) the probe for ADA (Adenosine deaminase) is the first that has a different trend. six of the 44 genes identified by GATHER are related to epidermis development (CDSN, CLDN1, DSG1, DST, LGALS7, LRIG3, PCDH21, PKP1), p-value0.0001, Bayes Factor 7. 'Cell adhesion' has now 13 genes, CDSN, CLDN1, COL7A1, DSC2, DSG1, DST, JUP, LGALS7, LRIG3, PCDH21, PKP1, SLIT3 THBS3 (p-value0.001, Bayes factor 10). 'Cell adhesion' has now 13 genes, CDSN, CLDN1, COL7A1, DSC2, DSG1, DST, JUP, LGALS7, heat map of expression of 27 probes with genes annotated showing functions on cell adhesion, cell-cell communication, tight junction mechanisms and epithelial cell polarity. the average expression of the skin samples is shown in green. the primary melanomas have a mixed behaviour.

AQP3 is a member of the aquaporin family of proteins. a novel strategy for drug development for melanoma (i.e. Elesclomol) works by inducing apoptosis via a mechanism of elevation of reactive oxygen species thus exploiting the \u201cAchilles hell of cancer metabolism\u201d [190]. re-expression of CLDN1 was correlated with suppression of cancer cell migration, invasion and metastasis. the results are provided as Haqq-PLoSONE-SupFile.xls (\u2018Results-correlation\u2019 sheet) this now gives ADA as the first ranked gene. this now gives ADA as the first ranked gene. in 1990, Craig et al. reported that SPP1 may work as an autocrine adhesion factor for tumor cells. they observed that SPP1 mRNA was expressed at moderate-to-high levels in 2 of 3 epidermal papillomas and consistently high levels in 7 of 7 squamous-cell carcinomas induced by an initiation-promotion regimen. this causes SPP1 to avoid the apoptotic stimulus, one of the \u201challmarks of cancer the details of the Gene Ontology terms which are significant and their associated genes are listed in Table 2. the details of the terms which are significant and the genes associated to them are listed in Table 2. analysis using g:Profiler largely coincides with the analysis using GATHER. but it retrieves 12 genes associated with the M phase of mitotic cell cycle. these genes are: ARPC1B [252], ARPC2 (which, together with SPP1)) and TFDP1/DP-1 [251]. [254], BST2/Bone marrow stromal antigen 2/Tetherin [255], CCL3/MIP-1alpha [256], [257], [258], CCT4, CDCA5/Sororin [259], [260], [261], [263], CENPF/Mitosin [264], CXCL1/chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (melanoma growth stimulating activity, alpha) [ phorin family of increasing importance in cancer research [309], [310], [311] and in particular due to its observed upregulation in undifferentiated embryonic stem cells [312]. SLAMF1/CD150 (a marker associated with hematopoietic stem cells [313]), SPP1/Osteopontin (which, together with ARPC2, is also in the novel 5-biomarker panel of Kashani-Sabet et al. [25 p63 is a homologous protein to p53, which is considered to be phylogenetically newer. p63 is a key regulator of the development of stratified epithelial tissues. p63 deletion results in loss of stratified epithelial and of all keratinocytes. p63 expression is not reported in 57 out of 59 tumors in a tissue microarray study. ADA is a gene involved in cell division and proliferatation. ADA has two TP53 binding sites, leading to a complex metabolic balance. loss of DPP4 immunostaining helps to discriminate malignant melanomas from deep penetrating nevi. ADA could potentially be downregulating DPP4 [133], 134. elicitation of complementary role of these two biomarkers is necessary. PLK1 has a high value of (negative) Spearman correlation with the values of the Jensen-Shannon divergence of samples with the average metastatic profile. in 2002, Kneisel et al. have conducted a study to investigate the expression of PLK1 in very thin melanomas. sen-Shannon divergences reveals biomarkers for loss of cell adhesion, cell-cell communication, impairment of tight junction mechanisms and dysregulation of epithelial cell polarity. six of 44 genes identified by GATHER are related to epidermis development (CDSN, CLDN1, DSG1, DST, LGALS7, LRIG3, PCDH21, PKP1), p-value0.0001, Bayes Factor 16. 'Cell adhesion' has now 13 genes, CDSN, CLDN1, COL7A1, DSC2, DSG1, DST, JUP, LGALS7, LRIG3, PCDH21, PKP1, SLIT3 THBS3 (p-value0.001, Bayes factor 10). this process includes the loss of function of genes that are essential for the maitainance of tight junction and epithelial cell-cell communication. thelial structure is related to these genes. they show a pattern of increasing cell motility, chemotaxis and positive regulation of cell proliferation. we will first discuss the processes related to the loss of adhesion, which could be linked to an increased probability of metastatic potential of these cells.

AQP3 (Gill blood group) is a member of the aquaporin family of proteins. three proteins of this family (AQP1, AQP3 and AQP9) have probes that seem correlated with melanoma progression, all losing their expression in the process of going from normal skin to metastatic melanoma. a novel strategy for drug development for melanoma (i.e. Elesclomol) works by inducing apoptosis via a mechanism of elevation of reactive oxygen species (of course, including hydrogen peroxide in cancer cells) the novel strategy for drug development for melanoma (i.e. Elesclomol) works by inducing apoptosis via a mechanism of elevation of reactive oxygen species. the results are provided as Haqq-PLoSONE-SupFile.xls (\u2018Results-correlation\u2019 sheet) this now gives ADA as the first ranked gene. using g:Profiler software, we obtain a complementary information. in 1990, Craig et al. reported that SPP1 may work as an autocrine adhesion factor for tumor cells. they observed that SPP1 mRNA was expressed at moderate-to-high levels in 2 of 3 epidermal papillomas and consistently high levels in 7 of 7 squamous-cell carcinomas induced by an initiation-promotion regimen. this causes SPP1 to avoid the apoptotic stimulus, one of the \u201challmarks of cancer value = 0.0003, Bayes Factor 5) is increasingly present (in particular, the M phase of the mitotic cell cycle) the details of the Gene Ontology terms which are significant and their associated genes are listed in Table 2. analysis using g:Profiler largely coincides with the analysis using GATHER. but it retrieves 12 genes associated with the M phase of mitotic cell cycle. these genes are: ARPC1B [252], ARPC2 and TFDP1/DP-1. BCCIP (BRCA2 and CDKN1A-interacting protein)/P21-associated protein 1) [254], BST2/Bone marrow stromal antigen 2/Tetherin [255], CCL3/MIP-1alpha [256], [257], [258], CCT4, CDCA5/Sororin [259], [260], [261], [263], CENPF/Mitosin [264], CXCL1/chemokine ( figure 11 shows a heat map of discussed gene probes annotated with functions on cell proliferation. this may indicate that the upregulation of genes involved in these processes is an earlier event (it occurs as a common event). metastatic samples (in red) show some heterogeneity, but overall provide an increased expression. the average expression of this panel could be a good indicator of the transition from nevi to a malignant phenotype. the panel of Figure 8 can complement the information indicatingthe onset of tissue dedifferentiation processes. samples that are entirely composed of Gleason pattern 3 tend to have a greater value of Normalized Shannon Entropy than 0.985. there seems to be two outliers (02_003E and 03_063) to the generic trend of the other 29 samples. the two outliers are samples that correspond to samples labelled as having Gleason 3 patterns. if the labelling is correct, this may indicate a subsampled group of prostate cancer that has Gleason 3 pattern characteristics but very low entropy. it may indicate an experimental bias for reasons we can not explain with the available clinical information. we have now computed two modified complexities, which we will call M-Gleason 3 and M-Gleason 5. we have a dataset with 13,188 probes and 29 samples for further analysis. we have used the same color coding convention we have used in Figure 12. the deletion of these two samples did not significantly alter the identification of biomarkers. a group of three samples with Gleason pattern 3 seem to have the largest Normalized Shannon Entropy values. there is also a cluster that only contains samples of either Gleason pattern 4 and 5 with Normalized Shannon Entropy values smaller than 0.985. a scatter plot of Spearman versus Pearson correlation values of the probe expression of 13,188 probes in True et al.'s prostate cancer dataset with the Normalized Shannon Entropy values of the samples. some of the most important biomarkers in prostate cancer are CDKN2C, MAOA, CDK4, CDK7, AMACR, TP53 and BRCA1. a double mutant mice develop a wider spectrum of tumors, including prostate cancer in the anterior and dorsolateral lobes. argued that CDKN2C and PTEN partner in tumor suppression by constraining a positive regulatory loop between cell growth and cell cycle control pathways. AMACR, Cyclin G2, CDK4 and CDK7 Other probes that also have high negative correlation with the Shannon Normalized Entropy correspond to CCNG2 (Cyclin-dependent kinase 4), CDK7 (Cyclin-dependent kinase 7), and AMACR (Alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase), an \u201cobscure metabolic enzyme (that has taken) centre stage\u201d [340] as judged by the extraordinary convergence to this biomark two \u201ctumor suppressors\u201d BRCA1 and TP53, their expression, status and mutations, to prostate cancer progression [51], [455], [456], [457], [457], [427], [427], [427], [427], [427], [427], [427], [427], [427], [427], [427], [427], [427], [427], [427], [427], [ Knockdown of BRCA1 results in accumulation of multinucleated cells. BRCA1 regulates gene expression of an orderly progression during mitosis. lack of BRCA1 function may impair activation of STAT3 [494] the loss of normalized Shannon Entropy gives us several markers that indicate a de-differentiation from a epithelial basal phenotype and an increasing loss of control of cell cycle regulation. the loss of normalized Shannon Entropy gives us several markers that indicate a de-differentiation from a epithelial basal phenotype. the gene that has the most negative correlations is CDKN2C. it has been previously associated with the transition from prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) to prostate cancer. it has been recently argued that CDKN2C and PTEN partner in tumor suppression. clorgyline, an irreversible MAO-A inhibitor, induced secretory cell-like morphology and repressed expression of cytokeratin 14, a basal cell marker. AMACR, Cyclin G2, CDK4 and CDK7 Other probes that also have high negative correlations with the Shannon Normalized Entropy correspond to CCNG2 (Cyclin G2) CR598707. two \u201ctumor suppressors\u201d BRCA1 and BRCA1 exist in prostate cancer. TP53 and BRCA1 exist in several studies linking two \u201ctumor suppressors\u201d. BRCA1 is one coregulator of AR, the androgen receptor [486], [487], [488], [489] and inhibits ESR1 (Estrogen receptor alpha) activity [490], [491]. a possible mechanism for gene silencing is CpG island methylation. the most positively correlated gene with the loss of Normalized Shannon Entropy is SFPQ/PSF (Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein-associated splicing factor) this is extremely interesting as it has been recently shown that the AR/PSF complex interacts with human PSA gene. the loss of expression of SFPQ and other proteins that together regulate androgen receptor-mediated gene transcription [500] may indicate they have a role not only as a biomarker of the progression and well CD40 is a member of the TNF receptor superfamily. in 56 out of 57 archival prostate cancer samples Palmer et al. have reported no CD40 expression. depletion of CD40 in the tumour microenvironment may be central in avoiding the action of the immune system [506], as prostate cancer induces a progressive suppression of the dendritic cell system [520]. it is perhaps a central piece which should be put together in context of other pieces of information coming from immunotherapy [508], [512], [513], [516] and pharmacological studies [507]. CD59 can is a more robust biomarker for non-invasive prostate cancer detection. Xu et al. obtained CD59 mRNA levels were determined by real-time PCR in matched (tumor/normal) microdissected tissues from 26 cases. they found that high rates of CD59 expression were noted in 36% of prostate cancer cases. lamins are \"scaffolders\" for the function of nuclear processes such as chromatin organization, DNA replication, cellular integrity and transcription [532] among the recent functions attributed to LMNA is as an intrinsic modulator of ageing within adult stem cells via a mechanism where LMNA act as signalling receptors in the nucleus. a functional association of LMNA and the retinoblastoma protein exists. pRB needs to be stabilized by LMNA for INK4A-mediated cell cycle arrest. somatic mutations in LMNA may also have a role in tumor progression. depletion of CD40 in the tumour microenvironment may be central in avoiding the action of the immune system [506] it is perhaps a central piece which should be put together in context of other pieces of information coming from immunotherapy [508], [512], [513], [516] and pharmacological studies [507]. delta-catenin to CD59 may be a more robust biomarker for non-invasive prostate cancer detection.

XBP1 expression was localized in epithelial and adenocarcinoma cells of the prostate. majority of refractory cancer cases exhibited weak XBP1 expression. NF-kappaB has been reported based on the centrality of NFKB. the first 38 genes in the ranking include 33 that have the regulatory motif V$NFKB_Q6_01 (GATHER reports for this list a p-value of 0.0006) 58 of them have the regulatory motif V$NFKB_Q6_01, with p-value = 0.003. the group of 58 biomarkers contains one of particular interest, STAT6. this gene is considered a survival factor in prostate cancer. this gene is a key regulator of the genetic transcriptional program responsible for progression. the contribution of the loss of these integrins and subsequent derived impairment on cell adhesion has been reported in several tumours. Ren et al. in [598] report that \"focal or no integrin alpha 7 eexpression in human prostate cancer and soft tissue leiomyosarcoma was associated with a reduction of metastasis-free survival\" the changes of the Normalized Shannon Entropy and Statistical Complexity of the gene expression profile of a cancer cell are associated with the gradual deterioration of genome transcriptional information content due to the modification of its structural and functional integrity during disease progression. our results clearly suggest that we can track the cancer cell's progression by following observable changes in the Shannon Entropy. some researchers understand cancer progression as a mechanism that increases entropy. we observe a reduction of Normalized Shannon Entropy in this work. this means that our normalized average expected surprisal, as receivers of the transcriptional message, is smaller. aneuploidy has been observed in poorly-differentiated prostate cancer cells. it is often associated with a more agreessive phenotype [602], [603], increased PSA levels [604], [605], and correlate with Gleason score [606], [607], [608]. gene fusions and chromosomal rearrangements are other source of increase in the \u201cdisorder\u201d of the genome organization. the phrase \u201ckaryotypic entropy\u201d has been used in the past to define what is actually a divergence from the normal chromosome structure and it genomic organization. this denomination has also been employed by several authors, notably [601], but it has also been used in at least two other publications [620], [621]. 'disorder' is an intensive magnitude bounded by 0 and 1, and \u2018order\u2019 is defined as 1-D(N) Landberg defines for a thermodynamical system that can be on N states the \u2018disorder\u2019 D(N) to be the Normalized Entropy (which is a function of time N(t) the escape to our paradox is \u201cachieved\u201d via making explicit the time variability of N(t) a biologist may regard a cancer cell as an entity that, during progression, may \u201cspread\u201d its transcriptomic profile. a biologist may regard a cancer cell as an entity that, during progression, may \u201cspread\u201d its transcriptomic profile. the normalized Shannon Entropy and the normalized Shannon Entropy are both reduced to 0.918293. physicists may find a fertile ground to explore new ideas and attempt novel mathematical formalisms for cancer progression. Hauptmann sees a malignant tumour as a dissipative structure arising within the thermodynamical open system of the human body. an energetic overload in most malignant cells is indicated by their abnormally high phosphorylation state. he believes that cancer is a special kind of adaptation to energetic overload. in 1871, Maxwell speculated the idea of a being, who can see the individual molecules, and who has enough reactive intelligence to open and close a small hole existing between two communicating vessels (called \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019) the being, without expenditure of work raise the temperature of B and lower that of A in contradiction to the second law of thermodynamics. the influence of temperature may be giving an interesting working hypothesis for further research. it could be the case that a fraction of p53 molecules become trapped in misfolded conformations due to the increased frequency of cycling. biochemical properties can also be challenged in a cancer cell. this in turn derives in metabolic processes running under abnormal parametric circumstances. the cell requires pores in its membranes to allow osmotic regulatory processes, yet it should preclude the conduction of protons. dowregulation of AQP3 was observed in all melanoma cell lines. dowregulation was also observed for the CNS and Renal cell lines. AQP3 was relatively upregulated for Leukaemia and Colon cell-lines. at least two members of this family have been observed in the inner mitochondrial membrane in different tissues. this in turn may indicate mitochondrial roles for aquapotins in osmotic swelling induced by apoptotic stimuli [714] could it be possible that we can track cancer progression by looking at some of these \"Maxwell demons\" a large subgroup of primary prostate tumors has reduced levels of AQP3 and AQP1 as most of the lymph node metastasis samples. a reduction is observed in primary prostate tumor samples (in yellow), with more than one half having negative values. our approach works in a retrodiction way in that it looks at data already obtained by other studies, but gives a unifying framework to track cancer progression. in some sense our approach also works in a postdiction way, as it helps to evaluate the speculation that cancer cells have \u201can entropic devolution\u201d we have previously mentioned that BRCA1 is a conspiquous biomarker. we found this to correlate with a preivous study that showed that BRCA1 has a reduced expression in immortalized prostate epithelial cells before and after their conversion to tumorigenicity [493] we also mentioned that the knockdown of BRCA1 leads to anaccumulation of multinucleated cells [492]. the first group of samples (1 to 9 in green) correspond to Gleason 3 pattern. the second group of columns (10 to 21 in yellow) correspond to Gleason 4 patterns. the last 8 columns (22 to 29 in red) correspond to Gleason 5 samples. the probes for MALAT1/MALAT-1 [742], [746], [747], [748], [749], [750], [751], [752], [755], [756], [757], [758] have a very conspiquous position. this is a non-coding RNA which was identified in 2003 in non-small cell lung cancer. expression of some non-coding RNAs should be monitored as useful biomarkers to track disease progression. we present again a scatter plot of Spearman versus Pearson correlation values of the probe expression of 13,188 probes in True et al's prostate cancer dataset. s ome probes have been annotated as corresponding to \u201cnon-coding RNAs\u201d. this non-coding RNA was first identified in 2003 in non-small cell lung cancer. it was shown to be highly expressed in lung, pancreas and prostate. but not in other tissues including muscle, skin, stomach, bone marrow, saliva, thyroid and adrenal glands, uterus and fetal liver. the loss of SFPQ expression during the progression of prostate cancer may be an important key to understand this disease or one of its subtypes. we have also mentioned that the AR/PSF complex interacts with the PSA gene (perhaps the most well-established prostate cancer biomarker) a long noncoding RNA called NEAT1/MEN epsilon/beta seems to be integral to their structure. a biochemical analysis by Clemson et al. indicates that the NEAT1 binds with paraspeckle proteins SFPQ/PSF, P54NRB/NONO and PSPC1. this suggests that the disruption of the function of the paraspeckles is correlated with the increasing signs of deterioration of normal transcriptomic state of melanoma and prostate cancer datasets studied. the quantitative changes of Information Theory measures, Normalized Shannon Entropy, Jensen\u2013Shannon divergence and the novel Statistical Complexity quantifiers are in high correlation with gene expression changes of well-established biomarkers associated to cancer progression. the proposed methodology uncovered for the first time evidence of the putative role of impared centrosome cohesion in melanoma progression. a group of samples having Gleason patterns 4 and 5 have lower Normalized Shannon Entropy values than a subset of Gleason pattern 3. however, a group of samples having Gleason patterns 3, 4 and 5 is revealed. our results provide a conciliatory middle ground that explains the perceived clinical usefulness of Gleason pattern classification. we have seen that current established biomarkers of the two diseases studied seem to correlate with those that best co-variate with these quantifiers. AMACR is now being recognized as one of the best biomarkers in primary prostate cancer with approximately 180 publications dedicated to it in the past five years. this hallmark allows, via the use of the Jensen-Shannon divergence, to identify the arrow of time of the process. it helps to map the phenotypical and molecular hallmarks of cancer as major converging trends of the transcriptome. the methodology has produced remarkable postdictions and retrodictions that show that it can predictively guide biomarker discovery. some researchers understand cancer progression as a mechanism that increases entropy. but we observe a reduction of Normalized Shannon Entropy in this work. this means that our normalized average expected surprisal, as receivers of the transcriptional message, is smaller. aneuploidy has been observed in poorly-differentiated prostate cancer cells. it is often associated with a more agreessive phenotype [602], [603], increased PSA levels [604], [605], and correlate with Gleason score [606], [607], [608]. chromosomal rearrangements are other source of increase in the \u201cdisorder\u201d of the genome organization. the term \u201ckaryotypic entropy\u201d has been used in the past to define what is actually a divergence from the normal chromosome structure and it genomic organization. this denomination has also been employed by several authors, notably [601], but it has also been used in at least two other publications [620], [621]. 'disorder' is an intensive magnitude bounded by 0 and 1, and 'order' is defined as 1-D(N) Landberg's decoupling argument between order and entropy may still be controversial in Physics. the escape to our paradox is \u201cachieved\u201d via making explicit the time variability of N(t) a biologist may regard a cancer cell as an entity that, during progression, may \u201cspread\u201d its transcriptomic profile, including the generation of a large number of novel molecular species. the average expected surprisal (Shannon Entropy) is H(X) = 1. the Normalized Shannon Entropy is now 1.5/ = 0.946. physicists may find a fertile ground to explore new ideas and attempt novel mathematical formalisms for cancer progression. Hauptmann sees a malignant tumour as a dissipative structure arising within the thermodynamical open system of the human body. an energetic overload in most malignant cells is indicated by their abnormally high phosphorylation state. he believes that cancer is a special kind of adaptation to energetic overload. in 1871, Maxwell speculated the idea of a being, who can see the individual molecules, and who has enough reactive intelligence to open and close a unique small hole existing between two communicating vessels (called \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019) the being, \u201cwithout expenditure of work raise the temperature of B and lower that of A in contradiction to the second law of thermodynamics.\u201d the influence of temperature may be giving an interesting working hypothesis for further research. if cancer cells are a different type of open system which also operates at a different temperature than a normal cell, the unfolding rates accelerate 10,000-fold. this is a nanotechnological design problem not faced by Maxwell. the aquaporins are considered the primary water channels of cell membranes. the specific functions of each member of this family are now being slowly mapped by several research laboratories around the world. dowregulation of AQP3 was observed in all melanoma cell lines. dowregulation was also observed for the CNS and Renal cell lines. AQP3 was relatively upregulated for Leukaemia and Colon cell-lines. at least two members of this family have been observed in the inner mitochondrial membrane in different tissues. this in turn may indicate mitochondrial roles for aquapotins in osmotic swelling induced by apoptotic stimuli [714] could it be possible that we can track cancer progression by looking at some of these \"Maxwell demons\" a large subgroup of primary prostate tumors has reduced levels of AQP3 and AQP1 as most of the lymph node metastasis samples. a reduction is observed in primary prostate tumor samples (in yellow) retrodictions, postdictions, predictions, Telomeres, non-coding RNAs and paraspeckles. our approach works in a retrodiction way in that it looks at data already obtained by other studies, but gives a unifying framework to track cancer progression. our approach works in a retrodiction way in that it looks at data already obtained by other studies. ballal et al. telomeric ChIP assays to detect BRCA1 at the telomere and reported time-dependent loss of BRCA1 from the telomere following DNA damage. we found a strong high correlation of the expression of BRCA1 with TERF2/TRF2 and a negative correlation with the expression pattern of TERF2/TRF2. the stacked average gene expression of probes corresponding to BRCA1 and TERF2 (telomeric repeat binding factor 2) in True et al's prostate cancer dataset. the first group of samples (1 to 9 in green) correspond to Gleason 3 pattern. the last 8 columns (22 to 29 in red) correspond to Gleason 5 samples. the so-called \u201clong non-coding RNAs\u201d [741] are also gaining a place in the scenario of cancer biomarkers. the probes for MALAT1/MALAT-1 [742], [746], [747], [748], [749], [750], [751], [752], [755], [756], [757], [758] have a very conspiquous position. our results indicate that the reduction of expression of some non-coding RNAs should be monitored as useful biomarkers to track disease progression. we present again a scatter plot of Spearman versus Pearson correlation values of the probe expression of 13,188 probes. biomarker in primary human lobular breast cancer identified more than three hundred reads corresponding to MALAT1 [749] this non-coding RNA was shown to be highly expressed (relative to GAPDH) in lung, pancreas and prostate, but not in other tissues including muscle, skin, stomach, bone marrow, saliva, thyroid and adrenal glands, uterus and fetal liver. the loss of SFPQ expression during the progression of prostate cancer may be an important key to understand this disease or one of its subtypes. we have also mentioned that the AR/PSF complex interacts with the PSA gene (perhaps the most well-established prostate cancer biomarker) a long noncoding RNA called NEAT1/MEN epsilon/beta seems to be integral to their structure. a biochemical analysis by Clemson et al. indicates that the NEAT1 erradicates paraspeckles. this suggests that the disruption of the function of the paraspeckles is correlated with increasing signs of deterioration of normal transcriptomic state of the cells. the role of SFPQ/PSF in the control of tumorigenesis is under investigation [787] and the information coming from these studies would need to be integrated with their role in paraspeckles. the quantitative changes of Information Theory measures, Normalized Shannon Entropy, Jensen\u2013Shannon divergence and the novel Statistical Complexity quantifiers defined here are in high correlation with gene expression changes of well-established biomarkers associated to cancer progression. the proposed methodology uncovered for the first time evidence of the putative role of impared centrosome cohesion in melanoma progression. the proposed methodology uncovered, for the first time, evidence of the putative role of impared centrosome cohesion in melanoma progression. our results provide a conciliatory middle ground that explains the perceived clinical usefulness of Gleason pattern classification. AMACR appears as one of the most correlated genes with the pattern of variation of Entropy of the samples. lapointe et al.'s dataset (File S1) Samples were obtrained from radical prostatectomy surgical procedures. samples are labelled as \u201ctumors\u201d if they contain at least 90% of cancerous epithelial cells. cDNA microarrays containing 26,260 different human genes were used. centered for each gene across all arrays according to Ref. [793]. 5,153 genes have been well measured and have significan variation in some of the samples. the authors of the study have also been very careful to include only one Gleason pattern in each laser-capture microdissected. the matched benign epithelium was captured for each cancer sample for a total of 121 samples. True et al. substracted the median background intensity from the median foreground intensity. the log ratios of cancer expression to benign expression were computed. the Shannon Entropy of an ensemble X (also known as the uncertainty of X), denoted as H[X], is defined to be the average expected surprisal for an infinitely long series of experiments. the theoretical frequency of an event \u2018the dice shows a three\u2019 is 1/6. the Normalized Shannon Entropy is defined as: the Jensen-Shannon divergence and the Statistical complexity measures Given a probability distribution function over a discrete finite set, is then straightforward to calculate its Normalized Shannon Entropy if we have the theoretical frequencies. the complexity measures are the product of a Normalized Shannon Entropy of the probability distribution function, and a divergence measure to a reference probability distribution function. we present a hypothetical \u201cgene expression\u201d dataset involving four samples each with the expression of five unique probes corresponding to five genes. the matrix is a hypothetical gene expression dataset involving four samples each consisting of probes for five genes. the normalized Shannon Entropy values for samples 1 and 2 are the same (H = 0.82). the Jensen-Shannon divergence provides a natural alternative to normalized Shannon Entropy. this simple example shows that the normalized Shannon Entropy variations convey information about global transcriptomic changes. however, this measure alone is not enough to characterize the deviations from normal tissue profiles. the sample with the smallest divergence to the equiprobability distribution sample 4 is sample 3. the sample with the smallest divergence to the equiprobability distribution sample 4 is sample 3. the sample with the smallest divergence to the equiprobability distribution sample is sample 3. lapointe et al. have performed a gene expression profiling using cDNA microarrays containing 26,260 different human genes (UniGene clusters). cDNA microarrays containing 26,260 different human genes (UniGene clusters) were prepared and Cy3-labeled cDNA used 1.5 g of mRNA common reference. samples have information of 15,488 spots per array, with a total of 7,700 unique cDNAs represented. the samples were obtained from frozen tissue blocks from 29 radical prostatectomies accessioned and selected to represent Gleason grades 3, 4 and 5. normalized Shannon Entropy, Jensen-Shannon Divergence and Statistical Complexity Shannon Entropy In many circumstances, experimental measurements are associated with the accumulation of individual results. the presence (or absence) of a particular result of an individual experimental measure is called an event. an event that can either fail to happen, or happens, as a result of an experiment. a hypothetical experimentalist guessing will have an average expected surprise of H[X] =. the Shannon Entropy of an ensemble X is always greater or equal to zero. it can only be zero if for one of the N elements of. the Shannon Entropy of an ensemble X (also known as the uncertainty of X) is defined to be the average expected surprisal for an infinitely long series of experiments. the theoretical frequency of an event \u2018the dice shows a three\u2019 is 1/6, if the dice is assumed fair, the theoretical frequency is the same for any number from 1 to 6. divergence and the Statistical complexity measures have been proposed. all the complexity measures used in this work are the product of a Normalized Shannon Entropy of the probability distribution function, and a divergence measure to a reference probability distribution function. in general, it is the average over a subset of probability distribution functions which are considered to be either the \u201cinitial\u201d of \u201cfinal\u201d states of interest. an example dataset to illustrate the principles of Shannon Entropy and the Information Theory quantifiers used in this work. sample 4 has the largest attainable value since the expression of all probes is the same. sample 4 has the largest attainable value since the expression of all probes is the same. sample 4 has the largest attainable value since the expression of all probes is the same. the Jensen-Shannon divergence provides a natural alternative. this simple example shows that the Normalized Shannon Entropy variations of the gene expression profile convey information about global transcriptomic changes. however, this measure alone is not enough to characterize the deviations from normal tissue profiles. the sample with the smallest divergence to the equiprobability distribution sample 4 is sample 3. the sample with the smallest divergence to the equiprobability distribution sample 4 is sample 3. the sample with the smallest divergence is 0.286636. the matrix is a hypothetical gene expression dataset containing four samples each consisting of probes for five genes. in sample 4 all probes have the same expression therefore it has the highest achievable value of Normalized Shannon Entropy (H = 0.82). sample 1 and 2 have the largest divergence between them,
