{"summary": "ALI affects an estimated 190,000 people annually in the united states. it is characterized by diffuse pulmonary edema and severe hypoxemia in the absence of clinical evidence of left atrial hypertension. a GWAS approach would identify common genetic variants associated with a reproducible differential risk of developing ALI. study was approved by the institutional review boards (IRBs) of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, University of Washington, Harvard School of Public Health, Vanderbilt University, and the University of California at San Francisco. ALI cases and at-risk controls were identified from severe trauma cohort studies performed at 5 U.S. centers. ALI is not a chronic disease, there is no known effect of cumulative life exposures on ALI risk following trauma; a major environmental insult (trauma) is required to become at risk for ALI. a recent study by our group found little difference between these pediatric population controls and other adult controls. quantitative transmission-disequilibrium test (QTDT) was implemented in the QTDT software package (http://www.sph.umich.edu/csg/abecasis/QTDT/index.html). Approximately 500 ng of genomic DNA from peripheral blood samples was used for each subject. the software version 1.0.16 was used in the study, and the default two-step procedure was adopted for imputation. the software requires several input files for SNPs and phased haplotypes. phase 1 with 600 cases and 2200 controls yielded greater than 80% power for a detectable relative risk of 1.5 or greater at an alpha of 0.01 for allele frequencies greater than 0.10. in Phase 2 we had 80% power to detect relative risks of 1.5 or greater at an alpha of 0.01 for allele frequencies greater than 0.10. pediatric population controls [27], [28] were chosen for the discovery phase. these controls were available in large number and had been genotyped on the same genome-wide platform during a similar time. there is no known effect of cumulative life exposures on ALI risk following trauma; there is no known effect of cumulative life exposures on ALI risk following trauma. eQTL in the setting of CL097-exposed B-LCL were determined using a linear regression model. eQTL were confirmed in the parent-offspring trios using the quantitative transmission-disequilibrium test (QTDT) [34] as implemented in the QTDT software package. the software version 1.0.16 was used in the study. the default two-step procedure was adopted for imputation. the software requires several input files for SNPs and phased haplotypes. phase 1 with 600 cases and 2200 controls yielded greater than 80% power for a relative risk of 1.5 or greater at an alpha of 0.01 for allele frequencies greater than 0.10. in Phase 2 we had 80% power to detect relative risks of 1.8 or greater at an alpha of 0.01 for allele frequencies greater than 0.10. a total of 5815 genotyped SNPs demonstrated association in the Phase 1 discovery cohort at p0.01. a total of 159 SNPs achieved p0.05 in the Phase 2 replication set with similar direction of OR when adjusted for age, gender, ISS. a leu29Ile substitution in CCL24 (or eotaxin-2) in a gene product. a leu29Ile substitution in CCL24 (or eotaxin-2) in a gene product. containing 7A 221981 10 rs1948837 1.56 0.0061 G 0.06 0.04 1.89 0.0447 PRKG1 protein kinase, cGMP-dependent, type I 5592 8 rs12547884 0.78 0.0068 A 0.18 0.26 0.66 0.0162 MSRA methionine sulfoxide reductase A 4482 7 rs2302006 0.78 0.0072 A 0.17 0.24 0.70 0.04 159 SNPs replicated in phase 2 were next carried forward to functional evaluation in phase 3. the PPFIA1 gene encodes liprin alpha, a protein involved in cell adhesion and cell-matrix interactions. several of these candidate genes contained additional loci associated with ALI risk including IL10, FAS [44], MYLK [45], and ANGTP2. the specific SNPs from prior publications did not replicate in case of FAS and MYLK.
