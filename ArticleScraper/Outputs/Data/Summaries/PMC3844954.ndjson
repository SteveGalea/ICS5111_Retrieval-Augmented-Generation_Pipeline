{"summary": "type III interferon lambda (IFN) is a recently discovered group of interferons. they signal via a complex consisting of the IFNR1 and IL-10R2 receptor chains. the IFNR1 receptor chain is expressed on cells of epithelial origin. trials using pegylated IFN1 against hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection have been completed. the responses to the current standard treatment for HCV infection depend both on the viral genotype and on the genetics of the patient. the authors produced recombinant IFN4 inactive protein using insect cells. this protein was purified from cell lysates and not from the media. the lack of IFN4 secretion led to the suggestion that IFN4 signals via an intracellular receptor. we cloned a codon-optimised cDNA encoding the mature form of human IFN4 with an N-terminal 6 His tag followed by a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site into a pET-15b vector. the protein was then refolded in vitro and purified to homogeneity by cation exchange chromatography. recombinant IFN4 is highly active and activates the IFI6 promoter in a concentration-dependent manner comparable to IFN3. the activity of the recombinant IFN4 was tested and compared to IFN3 in HL-116 reporter cells. HEK293 cells were transfected with IFNR1 and/or treated with siRNA against IL-10R2. the cells were either treated with IFN3, IFN4 or left untreated. the cells were then either treated with IFN3 or treated with IFN4. the IL-10R2 antibody did not result in any activation of the reporter gene on its own. both IFN3 and IFN4 signalling were sensitive to the IL-10R2 antibody, whereas IFN signalling was unaffected. the overall structure of homIFN4 is similar to that of IFN3 (Figure 3C) the positions of the helices in IFN3 and in the model of IFN4 are shown. a possible N-linked glycosylation site at Asn61 is marked by a square in IFN4. the position of individual structural elements is denoted as A\u2013F. IFN4 suggests a conservation of the helical structure and the way this is presented to IL-10R2. the conserved residues in helix D are primarily hydrophobic residues, which dock helix D to the rest of the structure and thus determine the steric conformation of this helix. this is most likely crucial for the activation as both receptor chains need to be engaged simultaneously. hCD81-Fluc cells were transfected with a HCV genome. the 4-h post-transfected cells were treated with IFN, IFN3 or IFN4 for 72 h. all interferon treatments resulted in a concentration-dependent decline in HCV replication. the IFNR1 chain is expressed on cells of epithelial origin. for this study, we used primary HAE cultures. this system is based on primary human bronchial epithelial cells grown in air\u2013liquid interface. the antiviral effect of IFN, IFN3 and IFN4 against the coronavirus MERS-CoV was tested in human HAE cultures. experiments were performed in triplicate on each of the three donors, mean and s.d. are shown. western blots were performed on the intracellular and extracellular fractions. for both the MYC- and FLAG-tagged constructs, IFN3 is present in the media regardless of whether it has its own or the IFN4 SP. the poor secretion of IFN4 cannot solely be ascribed to the SP. IFN4 is predicted to contain a single N-linked glycosylation site at Asn61. treatment with PNGase F resulted in a single band at 18\u201319 kDa. to test whether active IFN was secreted from the transfected cells, we added the supernatant from the transfected cells. this resulted in a clear signal from both IFN3 and IFN4, which was dependent upon IFNR1. IFN4 contains a potential N-linked glycosylation site. we observed a fraction of the intracellular protein which had a size suggesting post-translational modifications. we refined the detection of IFN4 in the media of transfected cells. Western blot of acetone precipitated media from cells transfected with empty vector or FLAG-tagged IFN3 or IFN4. HEK293 cells were transfected with IFNR1 as well as the interferon inducible luciferase reporter system. arrows show the position of IFN4. lectin that binds terminal -D mannose and -D glucose found on high mannose and hybrid N-linked glycans. in the IFN4-transfected cells, there was interferon activity in the input before addition of the Con A beads. this activity was removed after incubation with the beads. protein has a size of 17 kDa (Figure 1C) corresponding to IFN4 without the SP. refolded IFN4 was loaded on an anion exchange column (5 ml Hi trap SP FF) the protein was eluted from the column using a salt gradient. hepG2 cells were treated with IFN (1000 U/ml), IFN3 (10 ng/ml) or IFN4 (10 ng/ml) after 4 h, the level of the interferon-induced genes, IFIT1, MX1 and OASL, was quantified by qPCR. HEK293 cells were transfected with IFNR1 and/or treated with IL-10R2 as indicated. the expression of IFNR1 by transfection renders them highly responsive to both IFN4 and IFN3. however, this signal is largely lost when IL-10R2 is knocked down using siRNA. the IL-10R2 antibody did not result in any activation of the reporter gene on its own. two conserved disulphide links are expected to exist in IFN4. in both cases, homIFN4 is compatible with the formation of these disulphide links. IL-10R2 is a shared chain capable of binding several different cytokines. the chain is thus promiscuous, allowing itself to interact with different ligands. the structure of homIFN4 is compatible with binding to IFNR1. the overall structure of homIFN4 is very similar to IFN1 in the receptor-bound conformation. the glycosylation site N61 in IFN4 is equivalent to W47 in IFN1. we believe this position offers sufficient flexibility to allow for simultaneous glycosylation of N61 and receptor binding. the antiviral effect of IFN against replication of the HCV JcR-2a chimaera in the HepG2 cell line is shown. the plot shows the average of three independent experiments with the Renilla luciferase activity normalised to the untreated control. treating the HAE culture with IFN, IFN3 or IFN4 reduces replication of HCoV-229E-luc. IFN is the strongest interferon, whereas IFN3 and IFN4 are equally strong. poor secretion of IFN4 is not due to a weak SP. we made chimaeric proteins of IFN3 with the SP of IFN4. western blots were performed on the intracellular and extracellular fractions. extracellular supernatants from HEK293 cells transfected with the pEF2 vector containing IFNR1 were added to HEK293 cells transfected with an interferon-inducible luciferase reporter system. in (B), the extracellular fraction was undiluted whereas in (C) a serial dilution was performed. the bottom band corresponds to the expected size of IFN4 with the MYC or FLAG tags. in order to estimate how much IFN4 is secreted, we titrated supernatants from IFN3- and IFN4-transfected cells. this resulted in a substantially lower activity in the supernatant from IFN4-transfected cells compared to IFN3-transfected cells. this resulted in a substantially lower activity in the supernatant from IFN3- and IFN4-transfected cells. IFN4, IFN3 or IFN4 N61D were analysed by western blotting. Neither IFN4 nor IFN4 N61D is detectable in the extracellular fraction by standard western blotting. however, when we carry out acetone precipitation on the media before western blotting, we see a clear band for IFN4 but not for IFN4 N61D. we incubated media from IFN4-transfected cells with Con A beads. the glycosylated IFN4 is the source of the measured interferon activity. arrows show the position of IFN4 by boiling these beads in SDS page buffer. we produced recombinant IFN4 protein in E. coli. we did not observe any significant difference in the behaviour of IFN4. we tested the activity of IFN4 in a standard reporter gene assay. IFN4 is a disadvantage in the context of HCV infection despite possessing a strong anti-HCV activity. we measured the antiviral activity of IFN4 against HCV, HCoV-229E and MERS-CoV and compared it to the antiviral activity of IFN3 and IFN2 respectively. in neither case did we observe any difference between IFN3 and IFN4 in all viral infection models tested. the induction of ISGs occurs through the canonical IFN receptor complex. but we cannot exclude that IFN4 has activities outside the induction of ISGs. this could be mediated through an as yet unidentified receptor. this suggests that IFN4 is highly active against HCV. we produced chimaeric cDNAs where we swapped the SPs between IFN3 and IFN4. we showed that the IFN4 was retained within the cells regardless of which SP was used. this is reflected by reduced activity of media from IFN4-transfected cells compared to media from IFN3-transfected cells. removing the glycosylation site is not sufficient to make IFN4 shift to the secretion pathway used by the non-glycosylated IFN3. our structure modelling suggested that the sugars were attached outside the receptor-binding site, and the activity that we recovered from the supernatant of IFN4-transfected cells suggested that the sugars did not interfere with activity. IL-10R2 receptor complex We produced recombinant IFN4 protein in coli. we did not observe any significant difference in the behaviour of IFN4 compared to other isoforms of IFN during purification. we tested the activity of IFN4 in a standard reporter gene assay. IFN4 is a disadvantage in the context of HCV infection despite possessing a strong anti-HCV activity. we measured the antiviral activity of IFN4 against HCV, HCoV-229E and MERS-CoV and compared it to the antiviral activity of IFN3 and IFN2 respectively. we did not observe any difference between IFN3 and IFN4 in all viral infection models tested. the induction of ISGs occurs through the canonical IFN receptor complex. but we cannot exclude that IFN4 has activities outside the induction of ISGs. this is despite the fact that it has been shown to be a predictor of poor response. we produced chimaeric cDNAs where we swapped the SPs between IFN3 and IFN4. we observed that the IFN4 was retained within the cells regardless of which SP was used. the secretion of the mature IFN3 protein was not significantly affected by the SP used. removing the glycosylation site is not sufficient to make IFN4 shift to the secretion pathway used by the non-glycosylated IFN3. removing the glycosylation site is not sufficient to make IFN4 shift to the secretion pathway used by the non-glycosylated protein. protein expression, purification and refolding IFN4 (NM_001276254, amino acids 23\u2013179) preceded by a 6 His tag followed by a TEV protease cleavage site was codon optimised for E. coli. the construct was cloned into the pET-15b vector using Fastdigest KpnI and Fastdigest XhoI. catccttgtaatccgatccgaggcaaggccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc agttctagatcacagatcctcctcactaatcagtttctgccgatccgaggcaaggccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc the following PCR programme was used 1: 95\u00b0C for 5 min 2: 30 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 1 min, 59\u00b0C for 1 min and 72\u00b0C for 5 min and 45 s 3: 72\u00b0C for 7 min. all the constructs were cloned into the pEF2 vector using Fastdigest Kpn I and Fastdigest XbaI. the activity of IFN4 and IFN3 was tested in HL-116 cells. the cells were stably transfected with IFNR1 to render them responsive to IFN. 1 105 HEK293 cells per well were seeded in a 24-well plate in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. after 24 h, cells were transfected with siRNA against IL-10R2 or control siRNA. after 6 h, media was changed to fresh media supplemented with 10% FBS.
