{"summary": "100 patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft, with or without valve replacement surgery, will be recruited into a 2-group, parallel, superiority, double-blinded randomised controlled trial. participants will be randomised to either preoperative patient education comprising of a video and ICU tour with standard care or standard education (control) family satisfaction surveys have been developed with sound psychometric properties. the key domains related to family satisfaction include ICU environment5 6 and process of care,5 sufficient information, and quality communication with medical professionals to make important decisions. studies have shown that multimedia educational interventions can reduce anxiety and foster an understanding of the processes and risks of cardiac surgery for patients18 and their family members. results from a multicentre study in a non-cardiac ICU21 showed that disclosing all the available information in a frank, direct and empathetic way could meet the informational needs of family members about the patients. 4.5 to 4.1, on a scale from 0 (no anxiety) to 100 (maximum anxiety) in medical and surgical critically ill ICU patients. there was a moderate correlation between family perception of informational support and satisfaction with care. however, very little correlation between informational support and anxiety levels was found. primary hypothesis is that preoperative patient education will increase patient and family satisfaction levels after elective cardiac surgery. secondary hypothesis is that preoperative patient education will reduce patient anxiety and depression measures after cardiac surgery. the prevalence of clinically significant anxiety and depression in patients awaiting CABG was 28% and 47% respectively. the prevalence of clinically significant anxiety and depression in patients awaiting CABG was 28% and 47%, respectively. a recent study showed that an effective nurse-led preoperative education reduced anxiety levels, but also reduced the risk of postoperative complications, such as sternal infection, in cardiac surgical patients. the evidence to support benefits from patient education in the ICU setting is mixed. two-group, parallel, superiority, double-blinded randomised controlled trial will examine the effectiveness of a multifaceted patient education intervention on patient and family satisfaction. primary objective is to determine the effect of preoperative patient education package on patient and family satisfaction with care and decision-making in the ICU. all elective CABGvalve surgery patients are routinely admitted to our 22-bed ICU for early postoperative care and monitoring with 1:1 nursing at all times. only adult patients undergoing primary elective surgery whose primary language is cantonese will be recruited from the operating theatre list published on the day before cardiac surgery. a study of 100 patients is adequately powered to detect a decrease in anxiety (unadjusted mean difference of 2.7) score at day 7 after cardiac surgery. a study of 100 is adequately powered to detect a decrease in anxiety (unadjusted mean difference of 2.7) score at day 7 after cardiac surgery. unstructured information about the general process and risk associated with surgery and anaesthesia, postoperative care, and the care after discharge from hospital will be given in the usual manner. all patients will receive standardised surgical processes and perioperative care under existing protocols for postoperative ICU sedation, analgesia and weaning from mechanical ventilation. all patients will receive a standardised anaesthesia, described in detail elsewhere,31 with volume-controlled ventilation set at a tidal volume of 8 the medical management (video) The common weaning strategy from mechanical ventilator; The duration of the placement of the chest drainage tubes; What delirium is and how to treat it; The expected length of stay in the ICU. both satisfaction surveys consist of two parts, satisfaction with overall care (14 items) and satisfaction with decision-making (10 items) all items use a five-point Likert scale, and will be recoded and transformed to a 0\u2013100 scale. the incidence of anxiety and depression will be defined as HADS subscale scores of 8.38. the internal reliability Cronbach's values for the anxiety and depression were 0.77 and 0.82 respectively. the full scale is 0.86.30. the HADS will be used at the time of consent into the study. analysis Missing data will be checked and imputed using the median for continuous variables or the most common category value for categorical variables to preserve power. if there is 10% missing data, multiple imputation techniques will be used. data will be kept confidential in secure offices of the department of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care. only group data will be published. it is anticipated that there will be no serious adverse events caused by trial patient education intervention. patient education intervention includes a video in cantonese, the predominant language used in Hong Kong. patients will be excluded if they have a history of dementia, psychosis or neurological disease that would prevent them from completing outcome questionnaires. randomisation and allocation concealment Block randomisation with 1:1 allocation will be carried out according to a computer-generated sequence. the treatment allocation will be concealed in consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes, and opened after obtaining patient consent before surgery and measuring of baseline anxiety and depression levels. patients randomly allocated to the treatment group will receive the same standard care provided in the control group, as well as the patient education package conducted in the ward 1 day before cardiac surgery. a 5\u201310 min tour of the ICU, conducted by a dedicated ICU nurse, will be given to patients and their family members after the video intervention. three multiple choice questions will be asked at the conclusion of the video presentation. patients will receive the standard preoperative consultations by surgeons and anaesthesiologists, and nursing care in the cardiac surgical wards. information covered in preoperative video and intensive care unit (ICU) tour will be given to patients and their family members after the video intervention. three multiple choice questions will be asked at the conclusion of the video presentation. the original, 34-item English FS-ICU33 has been shortened to a 24-item English FS-ICU version. however, the 34-item Hong Kong Chinese FS-ICU has not undergone formal psychometric validation except for face validity. a blinded outcome assessor will help participants fill in the questionnaire. the proposed secondary outcomes will be the change in anxiety and depression scores using the Chinese\u2013Cantonese version of HADS.30 This is a valid and reliable tool comprising of seven questions relating to anxiety and depression (anxiety subscale) satisfaction in the ICU survey33 has been well validated in numerous studies,4 34\u201336 and translated into Chinese5 and other languages. the original, 34-item English FS-ICU33 has been shortened to a 24-item English FS-ICU version. each item is scored according to a four-point scale (0\u20133) and for each subscale, the score ranges from 0 to 21. the internal reliability Cronbach's values for the anxiety and depression were 0.77 and 0.82, respectively, and the full scale is 0.86. blinded outcome assessor will enrol patients and family members into the trial. data will be entered into a password-protected database with built-in data integrity checks. intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses will be performed using SPSS software (IBM) the mean and SD of the patient and family satisfaction scores, and HADS anxiety and depression subscale scores will be analysed using independent t-tests. a preoperative video was developed in 2002. the video aimed to standardise the information content of the visit. it included information about the ICU environment, routine care and expected postoperative course of the patient. study will highlight aspects of ICU care and decision-making process for further quality health services improvement. results will be disseminated at an international critical care medicine conference and peer-reviewed journal. the video provides comprehensive and standardised preoperative information to patients and family members about ICU care. the video provides comprehensive and standardised preoperative information to patients and family members. the results will be disseminated at an international critical care medicine conference."}
