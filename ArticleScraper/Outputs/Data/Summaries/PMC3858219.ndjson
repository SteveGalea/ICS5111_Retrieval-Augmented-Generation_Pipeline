{"summary": "in 2012, the medical humanitarian organization M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res adopted a data sharing policy for routinely collected clinical and research data. here we describe how this policy was developed, the principles underlying it, and the practical measures taken to facilitate data sharing. the policy builds on the principles of ethical, equitable, and efficient data sharing to include aspects relevant for an international humanitarian organization. a case has been made that data sharing is an ethical duty in such contexts. for humanitarian organizations, there is a lack of guidance on how and what sort of data can and should be shared. a case has been made that data sharing is an ethical duty in such contexts. MSF consulted with the Wellcome Trust and the MSF Ethics Review Board [15] to adapt and expand these principles to include ones specific for MSF concerning highly sensitive data, benefit sharing, and intellectual property. the policy was drafted using a template from the UK National Cancer Research Institute [16]. the growth of open data initiatives has been led by foundations such as the Wellcome Trust and other signatories to the Full Joint Statement by Funders of Health Research. but practical and systemic limitations have limited real data sharing across medical and clinical research [8] and routinely collected clinical data [9] decision to share MSF data was made on a case-by-case basis on request. the policy was drafted using a template from the UK National Cancer Research Institute [16]. the use of nonidentifiable research data outside of original consent agreements was accepted if MSF tries to return to study participants to expand their original consent. use of data outside of original consent will always require ethical review. two situations were identified as needing ethical review. vision and Principles MSF commits to share and disseminate health data from its programs and research in an open, timely, and transparent manner. MSF will work towards maximizing the availability of health data of wider interest to public health researchers with as few restrictions as possible. the privacy and dignity of individuals and communities are not jeopardized. non-maleficence MSF projects are often located where there is political or ethnic violence, or where certain disease diagnoses are associated with government restrictions or potentially dangerous consequences. the overriding imperative for MSF is to ensure that patients are not harmed or compromised. data collected from MSF activities in prisons or situations related to or can result in detention or deprivation of liberty. data variables such as those that could indirectly imply, truly or not, racial or ethnic origin, or political or religious opinions. data that can put patients/participants at risk of stigma, discrimination, or criminal sanction. policy applies to all health data generated in MSF programs or sites. it includes data generated from health information systems, patient records, surveillance activities, quality control activities, surveys, research, and patients' or research participants' human biological material. only data whose dissemination is judged to have the potential to lead to greater health benefits for populations will be shared. a high proportion of data generated by MSF is considered sensitive. the stringency of the managed access procedure will be proportionate to the risks associated with MSF datasets. if applicants do not have sufficient financial means to cover such fees, exceptions can be made. to prioritize local benefit sharing, data sharing will prioritize data of benefit to the local communities where the data was collected, as well as to patients and communities similar to those in which MSF works. there is a recognition that benefit sharing can be with a wider community of individuals, and will not always result in benefits to the local community. data collected from MSF activities in prisons or situations related to or can result in detention or deprivation of liberty. data variables such as those that could indirectly imply, truly or not, racial or ethnic origin, or political or religious opinions. data related to sicknesses with an obligation to adhere to treatment. non-maleficence MSF projects are often located where there is political or ethnic violence, or where certain disease diagnoses are associated with government restrictions or potentially dangerous consequences. caution is needed when handling potentially sensitive data. data on sicknesses or epidemic outbreaks. Box 3. Sensitive Data Data considered sensitive by MSF: Any data from which an implication of criminal conduct could be drawn and/or that can put MSF patients or research participants at serious risk (including death) data variables such as those that could indirectly imply, truly or not, racial or ethnic origin, or political or religious opinions. data variables such as those that could indirectly imply, truly or not, racial or ethnic origin, or political or religious data that can put patients/participants at risk of stigma, discrimination, or criminal sanctions. social benefit MSF will prioritize data sharing requests that are of benefit to the local communities where data was collected. access to medicines, diagnostic tests, and vaccines for patients should remain consistent with such aims. the decision to include data will be guided by the vision and principles of the data sharing policy. a high proportion of data generated by MSF is considered sensitive, thereby requiring a higher level of oversight. access to the data collection will be open to all appropriately qualified researchers from academia, charitable organizations, and private companies, such as drug companies. if applicants for data sharing do not have sufficient financial means to cover such fees, exceptions can be made. data sharing policy will be aspirational and will rely on political engagement to ensure compliance. if research is likely to generate data outputs valuable for the wider public health community, researchers should develop a data management and sharing plan. the nature of humanitarian contexts can make this challenging. the nature of humanitarian contexts can make this challenging. the nature of humanitarian contexts can make this challenging. the way forward MSF's core mission is to respond to medical humanitarian crises. this priority makes it quite unlike the large research-oriented organizations that have pioneered data sharing."}
