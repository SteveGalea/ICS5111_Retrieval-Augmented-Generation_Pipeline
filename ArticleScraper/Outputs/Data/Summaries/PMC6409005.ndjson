{"summary": "microglial cells are the primary resident immune cells in the central nervous system (CNS) they are associated with defensive mechanisms to maintain homeostasis against brain injury. activated microglia exert protective responses by regulating innate and adaptive immune responses. however, activated microglia produce excess immune reactions which are detrimental to brain tissue. ylquinic acid derivatives [6], sixteen triterpenoid saponins [8, 9], one amide, one anthraquinone, one organic acid [9], three lignans, one diterpene, one phenylpropanoid, and two phytosterols. metabolites of the leaves of A. henryi have strong antioxidant and antiacetyl cholinesterase activities [6], and the 80% methanol fraction ESI-MS data were obtained using a Q-TOF micro-LC-MS/MS instrument.

BV2 cells were pretreated with compound 3 for 3 h and stimulated with LPS (1 g/mL) for 24 h. pretreatment with compound 3 attenuated the LPS-induced production of IL-1 and TNF-, but it had little effect on IL-6 production. mRNA levels of cytokines were examined to elucidate how compound 3 inhibits proinflammatory cytokine production. BV2 cells were pretreated with compound 3 for 3 h and stimulated with LPS (1 g/mL) for 30 min. pretreatment with compound 3 inhibited the phosphorylation of p38, p38, p-ERK, ERK, p-JNK, and ERK. NO and PGE2 as well as their regulatory enzymes iNOS and COX-2 are important mediators for neuroinflammation. proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-, are important factors in CNS immune responses, and mediate neurodegeneration. kappa B (NF-B) is one of the major transcription factors regulating inflammatory responses. when microglial cells are stimulated with ILs, TNF-, interferons, or LPS, NF-B can be activated following increased translocation of p65 and p50. this response upregulates the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules in microglial cells. savinin (compound 3) inhibited the production of NO and PGE2 and the expression of iNOS and COX-2 proteins in BV2 microglial cells. this compound significantly suppressed the release of IL-1 and TNF- at the protein and mRNA levels."}
