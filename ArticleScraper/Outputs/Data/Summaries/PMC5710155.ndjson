{"summary": "all procedures were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the US Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense IACUC. animals received species-appropriate environmental enrichment and were socially housed in IVC (allentown Caging, Allentown, NJ) pups were sexed at 3 to 5 d of age and tattooed for identification. all pups were identified on their feet, tails, or backs. all animals were chemically restrained by using isoflurane gas anesthesia. lateral tail veins and ventral tail artery were used for blood collection. maximum volume of blood collected per animal was set at 1% of body weight. current dosing instructions for meloxicam in adult rats are once every 24 h,6 so the 24-h time point was used to determine the mean plasma concentration of meloxicam. if the mean Cmax was significantly lower than the target Cmax in any of the pediatric age groups, the experiment was not repeated because the focus of this study was to determine a dose that would meet or exceed the adult Cmax. quality-control samples were prepared at 900, 180, 18 and 1.8 ng/mL meloxicam and spiked to 15 ng/mL meloxicam-d. calibration curves were generated in duplicate and analyzed in triplicate. each cartridge was prepared by adding 2.0 mL of methanol followed by 2.0 mL of 1.0 M acetic acid. samples were reconstituted in 90 L of 60% acetonitrile, 40% water containing 0.2% formic acid and 10 mM ammonium formate. ion source gases 1 and 2 were set at 50 and 75, respectively. the declustering potential was 50 V, and the entrance potential was 10 V. the qualifier ion transition was 352.2 to 140.9 Da. females were able to detect a 50% change from the estimated mean Cmax. a coefficient of variation was 33% at an level of 0.05 and 80% power. specimens were embedded and sectioned on a rotary microtome. animals were free of Sendai virus, pneumonia virus of mice, rat coronavirus, rat coronavirus, reovirus type 3, Mycoplasma pulmonis, rat parvovirus, Helicobacter spp., lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, murine adenovirus, and endo- and ectoparasites. rat pups were weaned at 18 to 21 d of age and group-housed by sex. adult animals were euthanized by means of decapitation. meloxicam was administered subcutaneously as close to the interscapular region as possible. lateral tail veins and ventral tail artery were used for blood collection. a warm water bath or contact with a warming pad was used to improve blood circulation and vessel dilation prior to blood collection. maximum volume of blood collected per animal was set at 1% of the body weight over a 24-h period. current dosing instructions for meloxicam in adult rats are once every 24 h,6 so the 24-h time point was used to determine the mean plasma concentration of meloxicam at the prescribed redosing point. if the mean Cmax in a pediatric group was significantly lower than the target Cmax, the experiment was not repeated because the focus of this study was to determine a dose that would meet or exceed the adult Cmax. quality-control samples were prepared at 900, 180, 18 and 1.8 ng/mL meloxicam. the samples were spiked to 15 ng/mL meloxicam-d. calibration curves were used to determine intra- and interday variability. the eluent was collected in polystyrene tubes and evaporated under a dry nitrogen stream at 40 \u00b0C. samples were reconstituted in 90 L of 60% acetonitrile, 40% water containing 0.2% formic acid and 10 mM ammonium formate. meloxicam-d ion transition was 352.2 to 140.9 Da. collision energy of 30 eV and collision exit potential of 20 V. peak areas were integrated by using Analyst software (Sciex) specimens were embedded and sectioned on a rotary microtome. slides were stained with Mayer hematoxylin and eosin Y with phloxine. male, female, and all adult (PND70) rats had similar plasma concentrations up until 120 min after injection. the group needed to contain at least 4 animals for sufficient statistical power. each group needed to contain at least 4 animals for sufficient statistical power. at 24 h after injection, the mean plasma concentration of meloxicam in the pediatric age groups exceeded that of the adult rats. additional time points were omitted for the PND21, PND14, and PND7 groups because the Tmax occurred so quickly after injection in the PND28 group. the mean Cmax of meloxicam was 11.5 2.7 g/mL at 60 min after a single subcutaneous injection of 1.34 mg/kg meloxicam. female rats had a mean plasma concentration of 6.9 g/mL, with male rats much lower at 3.3 g/mL. male and female rats had similar plasma concentrations up until 120 min after injection. each group needed to contain at least 4 animals for sufficient statistical power. Cmax and Tmax in pediatric rats PND28 rats had a mean Cmax of 13.7 2.6 g/mL at 30 min after injection. the difference was not significant between adult and PND28 rats. age and Cmax/Tmax did not show a consistent pattern among the pediatric rats, such that the younger the animal, the higher the Cmax or shorter the Tmax. cokinetic analysis needs to be performed to further characterize the relationship between age, Cmax, and Tmax in pediatric rats. we selected 1.34 mg/kg as the dosage for this study because it was at the lower end of the typically prescribed dosage range (1.0 to 2.0 mg/kg)6 for adult rats. however, 5 samples acquired from the PND21 age group at the 24-h time point showed no signs of acute toxicity. we found that PND21 rat pups that were weaned at 18 d showed a surprisingly low body weight (average, 37 g; n = 50), weighing only slightly more than the PND14 cohort (average 28 g). the original decision to wean at 18 d was to remain consistent with current weaning strategies."}
