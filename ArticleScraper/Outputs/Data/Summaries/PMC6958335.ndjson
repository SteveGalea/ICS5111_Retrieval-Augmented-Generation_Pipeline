{"summary": "healthcare facilities have reported C. auris outbreaks in critically ill hospitalized patients with high crude mortality rates. risk factors for C. auris bloodstream infections (BSIs) are similar to the risk factors for other Candida species BSIs. C. auris is not in the databases or result options for some methods. auris can be identified by sequencing the D1\u2013D2 region of the 28s rDNA. there have been reports of C. auris being misidentified as Candida lusitaniae and Candida parapsilosis on VITEK 2. the absence of pseudohyphae or pseudohyphae on cornmeal agar should raise suspicion for C. auris. the VITEK 2 system (bioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy, L\u2019Etoile, France) included C. auris in its recent software upgrade (version 8.01) a study showed this software update had limited ability to correctly identify C. auris from the African and East Asian clades but was able to accurately identify isolates from the South American clade [15]. validation of this system upgrade is pending. all confirmed identifications of C. auris should be reported to local or national public health authorities. there are currently no established minimum inhibitory concentration breakpoints for susceptibility of C. auris isolates. infection control practices are crucial for controlling C. auris outbreaks in healthcare settings. some Candida are considered commensal organisms common in human flora. some Candida are considered commensal organisms common in human flora. have had an overnight stay in a facility outside the united states in the past year, especially in a country with C. auris cases. if transmission is suspected, the healthcare facility should consider expanding screening to all individuals on the ward. the presence of C. auris in any body site can represent a source for transmission. CDC advises identifying Candida isolates recovered from non-sterile body sites to the species level when: Clinically indicated. screenings for C. auris are commonly done using a composite swab of the patient\u2019s axilla and groin regions. other body sites or specimens from which C. auris has been isolated include the nose, mouth, external ear canals, urine, wounds. if limited number of single rooms are available, they should be reserved for patients at highest risk for transmission, such as those with uncontained secretions or diarrhea. co-colonization can be challenging as C. auris patients are often co-colonized with other different multidrug-resistant organisms. quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) are among the most commonly used disinfectants in healthcare settings. early studies found some of these compounds are ineffective against C. auris [45,53,54,55,56], but interpreting these studies is complicated because diverse methodologies have been used. ungicide, and rodenticide Act permits off-label use of seven additional disinfectants to control C. auris. this action is supported by efficacy data generated at CDC. further disinfectant testing and submissions for formal C. auris claims from the EPA are still needed. no conclusive evidence exists regarding the effectiveness of protocols for the decolonization of patients with C. auris. ATP is highly recommended that C. auris infections be managed in consultation with an infectious disease specialist. auris is an emerging multidrug-resistant pathogen that represents a serious threat to healthcare settings globally. many of the infection control procedures for C. auris represent standard and fundamental practices, such as hand hygiene or transmission-based precautions."}
