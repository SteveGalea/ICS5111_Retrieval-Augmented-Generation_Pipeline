{"summary": "the unbiased cCFR is the ratio of deaths from an infectious disease to the number of cases during the course of an epidemic. our method adjusts the biased cCFR by a factor of underestimation which is informed by the time from symptom onset to death. the estimates for influenza suggest that the virulence is comparable to the early estimate in Mexico. there are two approaches to assessing the latter aspect of a pandemic, the virulence of infection. one is to explore specific genetic markers of the virus that are known to be associated with severe influenza (e.g. the PB1 gene) [6], although the absence of a known marker does not necessarily indicate that the virus is benign [7] another is an epidemiological approach to quantification of the case fatality ratio (CFR) the ratio of the cumulative number of deaths to cases at calendar time t tends to yield a biased (and mostly underestimated) cCFR due to the time-delay from onset to death. similar estimates of such a biased cCFR for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have shown how such estimates can vary substantially as an epidemic progresses. the method takes into account the time from the onset of symptoms to death. we have replaced \u201cinfection\u201d in the denominator of CFR by confirmed diagnosis of infection. unbiased estimation of the cCFR does not address all sources of error in data. b t is a crude, biased estimate of the cCFR calculated at time t. p t, a random variable, yields an estimator of and is regarded as the realized value in one particular outbreak. this is easily demonstrated by relating C t and D t to the cumulative number of confirmed cases. b t tends to p t and becomes an unbiased estimator. the aim is to obtain an unbiased estimator \u201cwell before\u201d observing the entire course of the outbreak. p t is calculated by rearranging equation (4): (5). we do not observe this outcome by time t: only for a proportion u t is the outcome observed. we can use equation (7) as a likelihood function to obtain the maximum likelihood estimate of p t. a proportion of those in the group still at risk is expected to die. for c t, we use the published dates of onset among confirmed cases, while f s is assumed known. we compare our estimate against the eventual stable estimate at the end of the epidemic. for simplicity, we employ an exponential distribution for the distribution of the time from onset to death, F(s), with a mean of 35.9 days [11], and f s is subsequently calculated as the daily increase in F(s), i.e., f s = F(s unbiased cCFR estimate uses 399 and 2978 cases, respectively, as our C t in equation (9) for the USA and Canada. the majority of 974 cases whose dates of onset have yet to be clarified may have experienced their symptom onset close to the latest time point of observation. the cCFR is interpreted as the conditional probability of death given confirmed diagnosis. the cCFR is interpreted as the conditional probability of death given confirmed diagnosis. unbiased estimator of cCFR would be proportion of deaths among confirmed cases. b t is the biased estimator of the cCFR. it gives a biased estimate, calculated on day t, of the cCFR. the aim is to obtain an unbiased estimator \u201cwell before\u201d observing the entire course of an outbreak. we call the multiplicative factor in equation (4) the factor of underestimation, u t, defined by (6) The estimator p t can be written as p t = b t/u t. of these, only a proportion u t has been at risk for dying by time t. the outcome for the remaining proportion 1 - u t is still unobserved. population and sampling process for estimating the unbiased case fatality ratio during the course of an outbreak. at time t we know the cumulative number of confirmed cases and deaths, C t and D t, and wish to estimate the unbiased case fatality ratio by way of the factor of underestimation u t. in the USA, there were 399 confirmed cases by May 1, with 394 known dates of onset. among 399 confirmed cases, 2 cases resulted in death by May 1. the biased cCFR estimates, b t in these countries were 0.50% ( = 2/399) and 0.13% ( = 4/2978), respectively. a few cases whose dates of onset were unable to be traced are also included according to their dates when a specimen was collected. for the unbiased cCFR, we use 399 and 2978 cases, respectively, as our C t in equation (9) for the USA and Canada. meanwhile, D t is 2 and 4 deaths, respectively. cCFR estimates as a function of time, i.e. the ratio of the cumulative number of cases to deaths at time t. unbiased cCFR at 27 Mar is 18.1 % (95% CI: 10.5, 28.1) the unbiased cCFR estimates, b t, are given by the ratio of deaths to cases. each prediction was obtained by using the exponential growth rate r up to time t and the cumulative numbers of deaths and cases at time t. overestimation is seen in the early stages of the epidemic, but the 95% confidence limits in the later stages include the realized cCFR. the maximum likelihood estimate of the unbiased confirmed case fatality ratio is based on observation by May 1 and June 10 respectively. the estimates are based on observation by May 1 and June 10, respectively, with 2 and 4 deaths among a total of 399 and 2978 confirmed cases, respectively. r in the USA and Canada is estimated at 0.183 (95% CI: 0.133, 0.245) per day and 0.300 (95% CI: 0.241, 0.367) per day, respectively. upper bounds are examined for confidence levels at 95% and 99%. p max in the USA is estimated at 21.2% and 30.7% at = 0.05 and 0.01 in the USA. unbiased cCFR at 27 Mar is 18.1 % (95% CI: 10.5, 28.1) an overestimation is seen in the very early stages of the epidemic. unbiased cCFR at 27 Mar is 18.1 % (95% CI: 10.5, 28.1) unbiased cCFRs based on observations by calendar time t and the biased cCFR estimates, b t, given by the ratio of deaths to cases. each prediction was obtained by using the exponential growth rate r up to time t and the cumulative numbers of deaths and cases at time t. unbiased cCFR estimates are given by minimizing the negative logarithm of the likelihood. the estimates are based on observation by May 1 and June 10 respectively. 2 and 4 deaths among a total of 399 and 2978 confirmed cases. a gamma distribution is employed for the time from onset-to-death, f(s) the upper bounds are examined for confidence levels at 95% and 99%. p max is estimated at 21.2% and 30.7% at = 0.05 and 0.01 in the USA. p max is estimated at 21.2% and 30.7% at = 0.05 and 0.01 in the USA. the unbiased cCFR estimate for the USA is a likely overestimation. the virulence of the novel pandemic strain is smaller in the USA and Canada than in Mexico. the unbiased cCFR estimate for the us is a likely overestimation. the current pandemic is the first where many confirmatory diagnoses of influenza have been recorded using RT-PCR techniques. other pandemics could have involved substantial numbers of false-positive cases in the denominator. a method which permits comparable assessment of virulence is ongoing. unbiased cCFR estimate for the USA may be too high. it is plausible cases diagnosed in later stages of the epidemic receive treatment at an early stage of illness (or even before symptom onset) the risk of dying is likely to be different for different subpopulations. data should be updated in a precise reporting interval at least during the early stage of an epidemic. unbiased cCFR estimate is useful for informing policy makers and the general public about the potential severity of an infectious disease. a conservative upper bound of cCFR is a more useful interpretation of the observed number of cases without death. we have some prior knowledge or a few observations of death which permit us to assume F(s) is known. an epidemiological study on cCFR of S-OIV with similar techniques and statistical philosophy has been published online."}
