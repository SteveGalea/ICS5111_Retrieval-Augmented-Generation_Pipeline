{"summary": "the putative pathogen of SARS has been identified as a new coronavirus. RNA viruses commonly have a high rate of genetic mutation. it is therefore important to know the mutation rate of the SARS coronavirus as it spreads through the population. the respiratory infectious epidemic, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), broke out and spread across the world, affecting over 8,000 individuals in 32 countries. by now the putative pathogen of SARS has been identified as a new coronavirus, a single positive-strand RNA virus [3-5]. the whole genome of SARS coronavirus was first sequenced by the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control (CDC) in Canada on 23, April 2003 [6], and a total of 16 SARS corona we selected 6 strains for which the accurate date of host death is known. we simplified the calculation by neglecting trivial non-linear effects of multi-mutation for a base. for an ancestor sequence S0 of a strain S, we can deduce for the assumptions above that E(S0, S) K(T - T0), where D(S0, S) is difference of the two sequences. the last common ancestor S0 of all sequences is the root of the hidden phylogenetic tree. from the time T0, the sequences should at least evolve along two different routes. from the time T0, the sequences should at least evolve along two different routes. from the time T0, the sequences should at least evolve along two different routes. the sequences included intermediate sequences (I) and final sequences (F) can be obtained in steps in the stimulation according to the given phylogenetic tree and the time parameters. by analysis of the estimated K from the data, we can get to know how the parameters affect our fitting results. the first verifiable SARS case was reported as early as on November 11, 2002. the best division is shown to the top, where one group include GZ01 and the other includes the other strains. the best division is shown to the top, where one group include GZ01 and the other include the other strains. each pair in G1 have a last common ancestor with a date T0*(i, j) > 0, while every two members in G2 have corresponding T0*(i, j) 0. This would imply that the strains in G1 have a more recent last common ancestor than those in G2. model 2 with wide time distribution had a narrower distribution of K, which indicates the fitted parameter has a smaller error. the difference between the two models hints a narrow sampling time window as a partially explanation of the large error on the estimated K for the real data. the difference between the two models hints a narrow sampling time window as a partially explanation of the large error on the estimated K for the real data. a more accurate model considering two evolution rate parameters may produce a more accurate estimation, particularly on a larger dataset with accurate sampling and sequencing times. the method is simple to implement and avoids the difficulty and subjectivity of choosing the root of phylogenetic tree. the authors acknowledge helpful advice from Geir Skogerboe and Chen Lan. the authors acknowledge helpful advice from geir and Chen Lan."}
