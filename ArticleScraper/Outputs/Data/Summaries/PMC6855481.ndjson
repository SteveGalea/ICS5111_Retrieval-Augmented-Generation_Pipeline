{"summary": "liver cirrhosis ranks as the 14th leading cause of mortality in adults in the world and in Korea, liver diseases rank as the 8th leading cause of mortality. the 5-, 10-, and 15-year survival rates of patients with cirrhosis are 68%, 57%, and 43%. patients with liver cirrhosis are not given the opportunity of liver transplantation due to a lack of donors. the model for end-stage liver disease with incorporation of serum-sodium has been recommended. studies on the prognosis of patients with cirrhosis have been mostly focused on terminal cases and anticipation of short-term mortality. most of them highlight the analysis of prognostic factors for mortality of patients. such analysis could provide a comprehensive and systematic understanding of patients diagnosed with cirrhotic complications. the average period of survival and average accumulated rate of survival between the high risk group and the low risk group were examined. mortality prognostic factors of all patients, the high-risk group, and the low-risk group were identified. a retrospective cohort study was carried out. data from March 1, 2017 to September 1, 2017 were collected by directly filling out the items of a case record, a part of the electronic medical records. for variables of the case record, the conditions of the participants on the first day of hospitalization were observed. if the mortality of the participant was confirmed, the period till the date of mortality was considered as the survival period. the MELD-Na score was calculated using 3.8 loge (bilirubin [mg/dL]) + 11.2 loge (INR) + 9.6 loge (Creatinine [mg/dL]) + 6.4 (etiology: 0 if cholestatic or alcoholic, 1 otherwise) the data were analysed based on the survival package provided by the statistical program R version 3.4.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). study was approved by an appropriate Institutional Review Board. participants were diagnosed with ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, or varicose veins. 263 patients were selected based on the criteria stated above. phalopathy, or varicose veins, was admitted to a general hospital for the first time due to that reason from January 1, 2002 till December 31, 2012. the data from March 1, 2017 to September 1, 2017 were collected by directly filling out the items of a case record, a part of the electronic medical records. MELD-Na was calculated using 3.8 loge (bilirubin [mg/dL]) + 11.2 loge (INR) + 9.6 loge (Creatinine [mg/dL] + 6.4 (etiology: 0 if cholestatic or alcoholic, 1 otherwise) the score is calculated using the equation of MELD + 1.59 (135-Na) the MELD-Na score is the score calculated using the equation of MELD + 1.59 (135-Na) (maximum and minimum of Na are 135 and 120 mEq/L, respectively) the data were analysed based on the survival package provided by the statistical program R version 3.4.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). 168 patients (63.9%) were men and the average age was 54.67 years. for the cause of cirrhosis, hepatitis B was for 173 (65.8%), hepatitis C for 27 (10.3%), alcohol consumption for 21 (8.0%), and others (autoimmune hepatitis, and unknown) for 42 (16.0%). in all participants and the high-risk group, the survival rate was dramatically decreased after 4, 11, and 13 years of follow-up. there was a significant difference in the accumulated survival rate over time between the high-risk group and the low-risk group (P.001). mortality risk rate for the participants having hepatitis C as the cause of cirrhosis was 5.32 times higher than hepatitis B (P.001) mortality risk rate for the participants having hepatitis C as the cause of cirrhosis was 5.32 times higher than that for men (P.001). mortality risk rate for the participants having hepatitis C as the cause of cirrhosis was 5.32 times higher than that for men (P.001). mortality risk 168 patients (63.9%) were men and the average age was 54.67 years. for the cause of cirrhosis, hepatitis B was for 173 (65.8%), hepatitis C for 27 (10.3%), alcohol consumption for 21 (8.0%), and others (autoimmune hepatitis, and unknown) for 42 (16.0%). the average score for MELD-Na was 7.60. in all participants and the high-risk group, the survival rate was dramatically decreased after 4, 11, and 13 years of follow-up. there was a significant difference in the accumulated survival rate over time between the high-risk group and the low-risk group (P.001) mortality risk rate for the participants having hepatitis C as the cause of cirrhosis was 5.32 times higher than hepatitis B (P.001). mortality risk rate of CTP Stage B was 4.01 times higher than CTP Stage A (P.001), and of CTP Stage C 7.56 times higher than CTP Stage A (P.001). mortality risk rate for the participants having periodic follow-up management was 0.46 times lower than having irregular follow-up management (P.001). the cut-off point of MELD-Na for this study was 14, relatively lower than that of other studies. it would be necessary to study survival rates of patients with cirrhosis, followed up for a long period, and make a comparison with this study. the cause of cirrhosis was also found to be an important predicator of mortality. the early administration of antiviral drugs is important for reducing the incidence of cirrhosis and disease-related mortality. a comparative study of mortality prediction tools has been constantly emphasized. it would be helpful to discuss the patient-reported outcomes that could affect the quality of life for patients. marital status and primary caregivers are important predictors, especially from the aspect of nursing. results for patients with early stage cirrhosis are very important. a study on the analysis of survival and mortality prognostic factors for patients with disease, other than complications of cirrhosis, from the perspective of nursing would be very beneficial. study analyzed mortality prognostic factors through the analysis of survival of patients with cirrhosis for the first time. early detection could allow for the correction of factors that might promote mortality, as well as prevention of recurrence of the complications."}
