{"summary": "samples from 1,088 cases were collected before oseltamivir exposure. samples from 1,088 cases were collected before oseltamivir exposure. samples from 1,088 cases were collected before oseltamivir exposure. oseltamivir was assayed with an LB940 plate reader. drug concentrations required for 50% inhibitory concentration of NA activity (IC50) were calculated with MikroWin 2000 software. antiserum was treated with receptor-destroying enzyme II (Denka Seiken, Tokyo, Japan) and adsorbed with turkey erythrocytes before testing, to prevent nonspecific reactions. a 0.5% suspension of turkey erythrocytes was used for the HI test. samples from 1,088 cases were collected before oseltamivir exposure. chemiluminescent NAI assay was performed with the NA-star kit (13) final drug concentration was 0.03\u20136,500 nM for oseltamivir and 0.03\u201312,500 nM for zanamivir. drug concentrations required for 50% inhibitory concentration of NA activity were calculated with MikroWin 2000 software. ferret postinfection antiserum was treated with receptor-destroying enzyme II (Denka Seiken, Tokyo, Japan) and adsorbed with turkey erythrocytes before testing. a 0.5% suspension of turkey erythrocytes was used for the HI test. resistant pandemic (H1N1) 2009 from outside Japan; black, oseltamivir-resistant pandemic (H1N1) 2009 from outside Japan; black, oseltamivir-susceptible (OS) pandemic (H1N1) 2009 from outside Japan; purple, 2009\u201310 current vaccine strains. the sampling month of each isolate is listed following the strain name. neuraminidase inhibitor treatment history was available for 1,707 specimens. of the 61 cases-patients, 36 (59%) were male; 19 (31%) were 0\u20134 years, 25 (41%) were 5\u201318 years, 12 (20%) were 19\u201350 years, and 5 (8%) were >50 years. gene analyses showed only 1 aa difference (D to G), at position 256 in PB2 and shared unique changes in NS1 and PB1. oseltamivir-resistant (n = 20) and oseltamivir-sensitive (n = 138) pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus, by strain, Japan, 2009\u20132010*. of the 138 oseltamivir-sensitive pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus samples, I435V and K660R (boldface) were observed from 32 and 12 isolates. these changes would sporadically occur in both pandemic (H1N1) 2009 isolate types. the patient\u2019s 2 brothers were both infected with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus and had received oseltamivir since December 15. the index patient had a mild cough beginning on July 12 and typical influenza symptoms developed on July 15. the OR pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus may have thus emerged naturally, with no selective pressure. analysis of the genomes of representative OR (n = 20) and OS pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (n = 138) provided further insight into their similarities. first, comparison of the internal amino acid sequences of each OR pandemic (H1N1) 2009 and OS pandemic (H1N1) 2009 isolate consensus showed that OR viruses possessed several sporadic amino acid changes, but did not exhibit any common amino acid changes unique to OR pandemic (H1N1) 2009 viruses. for zanamivir, 3 of 482 viruses were identified as outliers (cutoff >0.60 nM) one OS pandemic (H1N1) 2009 had a D151D/N mixture in its NA protein. 2 OR pandemic (H1N1) 2009, A/Shiga/43/2009pdm (0.64 nM) and A/Yokohama/1538/2009pdm (0.64 nM) possessed I34V and I195V substitution zanamivir and oseltamivir were excluded from the overall population. the cutoff values for zanamivir were calculated from the overall population (N = 482) only 0.5% and 1.7% of OS- (n = 3) and OR pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (n = 1) showed at least an 8-fold reduction in HI titer. OS and OR pandemic (H1N1) 2009 are antigenically indistinguishable and similar to 2009\u201310 current vaccine strain A/California/7/2009. oseltamivir-resistant pandemic (H1N1) 2009 from outside Japan; black, oseltamivir-susceptible (OS) pandemic (H1N1) 2009; purple, 2009\u201310 current vaccine strains. the sampling month of each isolate is listed following the strain name. of the 61 cases-patients, 36 (59%) were male; 19 (31%) were 0\u20134 years, 25 (41%) were 5\u201318 years, 12 (20%) were 19\u201350 years, and 5 (8%) were >50 years. two possible cases of human-to-human transmission were suspected. patients with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 were in a double room. genetic analyses showed only 1 aa difference (D to G), at position 256 in PB2 and shared unique changes in NS1 and PB1. of the 138 oseltamivir-sensitive pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus samples, I435V and K660R (boldface) were observed from 32 and 12 isolates. these changes would sporadically occur in both pandemic (H1N1) 2009 isolate types. 2 brothers were both infected with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus. the index patient had a mild cough beginning on July 12. symptoms had developed in the index patient\u2019s son on July 11. zanamivir (H1N1) 2009 virus was not detected from a sample taken that day) analysis of the genomes of representative OR (n = 20) and OS pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (n = 138) provided further insight into their similarities. first, comparison of the internal amino acid sequences of each OR pandemic (H1N1) 2009 and OS pandemic (H1N1) 2009 isolate consensus showed that OR viruses possessed several sporadic amino acid changes, but did not exhibit any common amino acid changes unique to OR pandemic (H1N1) 2009 viruses. 3 of 482 viruses were identified as outliers (cutoff >0.60 nM) one OS pandemic (H1N1) 2009 had a D151D/N mixture in its NA protein. 2 OR pandemic (H1N1) 2009, 2 OR pandemic (H1N1) 2009, A/Shiga/43/2009pdm (0.64 nM) and A/Yokohama/1538/2009pdm (0.64 nM) possessed I34 zanamivir-sensitive 0.09 0.02 0.24 0.10 Oseltamivir-resistant 51.76 9.54 0.37 0.13 *IC50, 50% inhibitory concentration; NC, not calculated. IC50 values of control seasonal influenza A (H1N1) viruses were determined from 10 independent experiments for oseltamivir. OR pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (n = 1) showed at least an 8-fold reduction in HI titer. OS and OR pandemic (H1N1) 2009 are antigenically indistinguishable. frequency of detection of OR pandemic (H1N1) 2009 was low (1.4%) OR influenza A (H1N1) was detected only rarely (1.5%\u20132.6%) in the 2007\u201308 season, despite the high level of oseltamivir use (13,22) however, the pattern of oseltamivir use did not correspond to the emergence and widespread distribution of OR influenza A (H1N1) viruses. the NA proteins of recent OR pandemic (H1N1) 2009 isolates likely did not possess such permissive secondary mutation(s) however, all recent animal studies of OR pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus have shown that viral fitness and transmissibility did not differ from those of OS pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus (24\u201326) most OR pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus was detected in samples collected at least 4 days after oseltamivir treatment or prophylaxis. however, the frequency of OR pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in each day of treatment could not be calculated because of a lack of treatment history data. a naturally occurring OR pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus caused a cluster of 7 cases in immunocompetent patients with no history of oseltamivir use (40) prevalence of OR pandemic (H1N1) 2009 remains low (1.4%) prevalence of zanamivir should be considered for immunocompromised patients.
