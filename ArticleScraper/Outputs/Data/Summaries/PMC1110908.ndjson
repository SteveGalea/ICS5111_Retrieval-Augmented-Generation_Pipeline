{"summary": "rapid transmission and high rates of mortality and morbidity resulted in a significant threat to global health by the spring of 2003. only a few cases were reported during the winter cold season of 2003\u20132004. by march 24, 2003, scientists at the centers for disease control and prevention and in Hong Kong had announced that a new coronavirus had been isolated from patients with SARS. the 1 PRF signal is able to promote efficient frameshifting in a rabbit reticulcyte system. it consisted of a typical heptameric \u201cslippery site\u201d (UUU AAAC), a 5-nt spacer, and a typical H-form mRNA pseudoknot containing two double-stranded RNA stems and two single-stranded loops. a sequence spanning nucleotide positions 13392\u201313472 satisfied these three requirements. the 1 PRF signal presented in that study contained a typical mRNA pseudoknot composed of two double-helical, Watson\u2013Crick basepaired stems connected by two single-stranded loops. the presence of a long, 29-nt loop 2 seemed to be unusual. a small, internally nested third helix (helix-3) has been shown to be present in the HIV-1 group O frameshift signal [14] a distribution of MFE values taken from 500 randomly shuffled SARS-CoV frameshift signals was created. each of the randomly shuffled sequences was folded using Pknots with the same parameters. all of the coronavirus frameshift signals have the potential to form a third helix. this property was only conserved among all of the group 2 coronaviruses. mRNA pseudoknot structures are predicted to occur within groups. meric slippery sites are indicated in brown; dashes indicate gaps in sequence alignments. downstream regions homologous to the kissing loop known to promote frameshifting in HCoV-229E [16,17] RNAs were 5\u2032 end labeled with 32P and subjected to enzymatic digestion. nuclease cleavage sites, proposed basepairs, and specific bases protected from nuclease attack are indicated. some notable deviations from the predicted structure were observed. two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments were used to confirm the predicted basepairing interactions of the three stems. the presence of 21 hydrogen-bonded guanine and uracil residues for the sequence was evident from the imino region observed in the 2D 1H,1H-NOESY, 15N-HMQC and quantitative J(N,N,N-HMQC spectra. different color coding was used to denote basepaired regions in stems 1 (cyan), 2 (green), and 3 (grey and blue) only the last two digits of the wild-type sequence numbering are used for clarity. the corresponding donor G38:N1 and U59:N3 imino nitrogens are not engaged in G:C or U:A hydrogen bonds. the quantitative J(N,N) HNN-COSY contains a total of five correlations between the imino N3 nitrogens of uridines and the N1 nitrogens in adenines. a total of 11 correlations stemming from Watson\u2013Crick G:C basepairs are observed between the imino the ability of the SARS-CoV sequence to promote 1 PRF was assessed using two different in vitro and in vivo assay systems each. in vitro, the sequence was able to promote efficient 1 PRF in both wheat germ protoplasts (23.7% 1.9%) and rabbit reticulocytes (14.3% 3.7%) the absolute values for frameshifting in yeast (2.99% 0.06%) were significantly less than those observed in the other systems (ranging from approximately 15% to 25%) the wild-type SARS-CoV frameshift signal promotes efficient frameshifting in vitro and in vivo. the series of mutants that were created by oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis to address this question is shown in Figure 7. the S3 mutant series were designed to examine the general requirement for stem 2 and the specific contribution of the bulged adenosine at position 13456. the complete data for these experiments, as formatted according to [25], are presented in Dataset S1. the adenosine base at position 13465 in this construct had to be replaced with a guanosine to avoid creating a 1 frame termination codon. however, the identity of the base at this position is critical for maximizing 1 PRF efficiency. 2A, S3A\u2032, and S3C\u2032 were constructed to investigate stem 3. mutants were directed towards addressing the function of stem 3. in S3A, the guanine and cytosine residues in the 5\u2032 half of stem 3 were mutated to cytosine and guanine respectively, disrupting stem 3. stem 3 is not critical for promoting efficient 1 PRF per se. an analogous series of constructs were also assayed in yeast. in general, the trends were similar, though the actual baseline frameshifting efficiencies were lower. a previous analysis of the SARS-CoV 1 PRF signal demonstrated that a sequence spanning nucleotide positions 13392\u201313472 satisfied these three requirements. the 1 PRF signal presented in that study contained a typical mRNA pseudoknot composed of two double-helical, Watson\u2013Crick basepaired stems connected by two single-stranded loops. a small, internally nested third helix (helix-3) has been shown to be present in the HIV-1 group O frameshift signal [14]. a distribution of MFE values taken from 500 randomly shuffled SARS-CoV frameshift signals was created. each of the randomly shuffled sequences was folded using Pknots with the same parameters. a strong conservation of base complementation in the cores of both stems 1 and 2. this analysis also shows all of the coronavirus frameshift signals have the potential to form a third helix. this property was only conserved among all of the group 2 coronaviruses. HCoV-229R, HCoV-NL, PEDV, and TGV are highlighted in red with the flanking stem-forming sequences underlined. asterisks indicate perfectly conserved positions in primary sequence. nuclease cleavage of RNA from nucleotides 13400\u201313470 of SARS-CoV. RNAs were 5\u2032 end labeled with 32P and subjected to enzymatic digestion. the three different concentrations of each nuclease are indicated by the triangles. two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments were used to confirm the predicted basepairing interactions of the three stems. the presence of 21 hydrogen-bonded guanine and uracil residues for the sequence was evident from the imino region observed in the 2D 1H,1H-NOESY, 15N-HMQC and quantitative J(N,N,N-HMQC spectra. different color coding was used to denote basepaired regions in stems 1 (cyan), 2 (green), and 3 (grey and blue) only the last two digits of the wild-type sequence numbering are used for clarity. the corresponding donor G38:N1 and U59:N3 imino nitrogens are not engaged in G:C or U:A hydrogen bonds. the quantitative J(N,N) HNN-COSY contains a total of five correlations between the imino N3 nitrogens of uridines and the N1 nitrogens in adenines. a total of 11 correlations stemming from Watson\u2013Crick G:C basepairs are observed between the imino the ability of the SARS-CoV sequence to promote 1 PRF was assessed using two different in vitro and in vivo assay systems each. the sequence was able to promote efficient 1 PRF in both wheat germ protoplasts (23.7% 1.9%) and rabbit reticulocytes (14.3% 3.7%) the absolute values for frameshifting in yeast were significantly less than those observed in other systems. the wild-type SARS-CoV frameshift signal promotes efficient frameshifting in vitro and in vivo. a series of mutants of the SARS-CoV frameshift signal were developed to functionally dissect the mRNA pseudoknot. the series of mutants created by oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis to address this question is shown in Figure 7. the S3 mutant series were designed to examine the general requirement for stem 2 and the specific contribution of the bulged adenosine at position 13456. the complete data for these experiments, as formatted according to [25], are presented in Dataset S1. the adenosine base at position 13465 in this construct had to be replaced with a guanosine to avoid creating a 1 frame termination codon. however, the identity of the base at this position is critical for maximizing 1 PRF efficiency. mutants S3A, S3A\u2032, and S3C\u2032 were constructed to investigate stem 3. in S3A, the guanine and cytosine residues in the 5\u2032 half of stem 3 were mutated to cytosine and guanine. the opposing mutations were made in the 5\u2032 half of stem 3 in S3A\u2032; and S3B harbored the compensatory mutations. a more typical two-stemmed RNA pseudoknot promoted a modest increase in frameshifting (9.2%, p = 2.15 103), demonstrating that stem 3 is not critical for promoting efficient 1 PRF per se. an analogous series of constructs were also assayed in yeast. stem 1 lengths and G:C compositions are highly conserved in all ten coronavirus sequences analyzed. the group 2 coronaviruses (HCoV-043C, HCoV-HKU1, BCoV, and MHV) have the longest and most stable predicted stem 2 structures. adenosine residues such as those at positions 13456 and 13467 (stem 2) are a recurring theme in RNA structural biology. the crystal structure of the ribosome reveals that RNA has a remarkable propensity for contributing adenine bases to such A-minor interactions. stimulation of 1 PRF requires specific noncanonical basepairing between helical stems and pseudoknot loop regions to set specifically required frameshift efficiencies. alterations to stem 3 significantly reduced frameshifting levels. this is supported by the observation that deletion of all but 5 nt between stems 1 and 2 did not significantly alter 1 PRF. alterations to stem 3 significantly reduced frameshifting levels. frameshifting levels in coronaviruses need to be regulated in a manner not supported by a two-stem pseudoknot. if stem 3 is not required to promote efficient frameshifting, why then has it been so highly conserved among the coronaviruses? phylogenetic analysis reveals the potential to form similar short imperfect stem 2 structures for the other two group 1 coronaviruses for which the sequence is known. however, similar interactions cannot be readily discerned in SARS-CoV, nor among the group 2 and group 3 coronaviruses. a final finding of interest derives from observed differences between yeast- and metazoan-derived frameshift assay systems. RNAMotif [12] was used to identify the nucleotide sequence corresponding to the frameshift signal's slippery site. RNAMotif [13] was employed to \u201cfold\u201d the sequence immediately downstream (3\u2032) to the slippery site. this resulted in a normal distribution of MFE values, against which the native sequence could be compared and z-scores calculated. yeast cells were transformed using the alkali cation method. cells cultured without antibiotics were transformed with plasmid DNA. luciferase assays were performed the following day using extracts from cells lysed with the Passive Lysis Buffer. at least three readings derived from lysates derived from a minimum of three different transfection plates were used. the oligonucleotides were synthesized, gel purified, and ligated into p2luc [18], generating plasmid pJD435. the Renilla and firefly bicistronic elements were amplified. the control construct with just the changes in the 3\u2032 portion of stem 3 was made from pJD465 (pJD567, S3A\u2032) pJD465 was also used as the template for mutagenesis to move the bulged A13467 residue out of stem 3 and into loop 2 (pJD492, S3C) pJD467 was used to eliminate stem 3 entirely (pJD469, S3) a zero-frame control plasmid (pJD464) was constructed by cloning the BamHI/EcoRI fragment from pJD465 into p2luci. an additional construct (A13465G) was made to control for the change at this position from adenine to guanine. the RNA was treated with calf intestinal phosphatase and 5\u2032 end labeled with [-32P]ATP. nuclease treatment with RNase A (1.0\u20130.01 ng), RNase T1 (1.0\u20130.01 U) and RNase V1 (0.1\u20130.001 U) was performed according to manufacturer's instructions for 15 min at room temperature. preparation of RNA samples for NMR A DNA construct was generated by PCR from pJD465 containing the wild-type SARS-CoV genome. RNA transcripts were purified by anion-exchange FPLC. the target RNA sample was eluted with an increasing sodium chloride gradient. the identity of the RNA product was verified by mass spectroscopy. observable iminos in aqueous solution are diagnostic for hydrogen-bonded guanine and uracil bases, which are protected from exchange with the solvent. a jump-return [53] 1H,15N-heteronuclear multiple quantum correlation (HMQC) was verified from scalar 2h J(N,N) couplings through hydrogen bonds. the search space included 1,724 viral genome sequences downloaded using the national center for biotechnology information's Entrez Taxonomy Browser. the resulting pairwise alignments produced by FASTA3 were used to produce a multiple-sequence alignment using ClustalW v1.82 [42] dual luciferase assays performed the following day using extracts from cells lysed with the Passive Lysis Buffer. wheat germ and rabbit reticulocyte lysates from Ambion (Austin, Texas, United States) were used to monitor frameshifting in vitro. at least three readings derived from lysates derived from a minimum of three different transfection plates were used. sequence analysis revealed an additional point mutation in the firefly luciferase gene that was reverted by oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis. the resulting plasmid, pJD465, constituted the wild-type SARS-CoV 1 PRF yeast assay plasmid. additional constructs with various mutations in the pseudoknot were made. pJD465 was used as the template to create a construct in which the bulged residue in stem 2 was eliminated by moving it 6 nt downstream (pJD491, S2C) or replaced by cytosine (pJD542, S2C\u2032). an additional set of plasmids was constructed from the parental plasmids described above that lacked the yeast-specific markers but contained the SV40 early promoter, T7 promoter, and SV40 pJD506/S3C, pJD539/S3C\u2032, and pJD490/S3) were used to generate a PCR amplicon. an RNA transcript was made using the Ambion MEGAscript SP6 kit. the RNA was treated with calf intestinal phosphatase and 5\u2032 end labeled with [-32P]ATP. in vitro transcription reactions with phage T7 polymerase were performed. unlabeled NTPs were purchased from Sigma Pharmaceuticals. RNA transcripts were purified by anion-exchange FPLC. NMR spectroscopy All NMR spectra were recorded at 5 \u00b0C, 15 \u00b0C, and 25 \u00b0C on a Bruker Avance 900 MHz spectrometer. data were processed using NMRPipe [51] and analyzed using NMRVIEW. a pattern matching descriptor of known 1 PRF signals was used in conjunction with RNAMotif [12] to identify the nucleotide sequence corresponding to the frameshift signal's slippery site. RNAMotif [13] was employed to \u201cfold\u201d the sequence immediately downstream (3\u2032) to the slippery site and to produce a predicted MFE value in kilocalories per mole for the sequence. trp1\u20131 ura3\u20131 leu2\u20133,112 his3\u201311,15 can1\u2013100 and the JD1228/JD1229 isogenic pairs in which the disrupted RPL3/TCM1 allele is complemented with pRPL3 or pmak8\u20131. yeast cells were transformed using the alkali cation method. at least three readings derived from lysates derived from a minimum of three different transfection plates were used. the oligonucleotides were synthesized, gel purified, and ligated into BamHI- and SacI-digested p2luc [18], generating plasmid pJD435. the control construct with just the changes in the 3\u2032 portion of stem 3 was made from pJD465 (pJD567, S3A\u2032) pJD465 was also used as the template for mutagenesis to move the bulged A13467 residue out of stem 3 and into loop 2 (pJD492, S3C), while pJD467 was used to eliminate stem 3 entirely. a zero-frame control plasmid (pJD464) was constructed by cloning the BamHI/EcoRI fragment from pJD465 into p2luci to generate a complete plasmid set for analyses of \u20131 PRF in epithelial cells. an additional construct (A13465G) was made to control for the change at this position from adenine to guanine, but is not involved in stem 2 basepairing. the labeled RNA was gel purified and then eluted with 0.5 M NH4Ac, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS. nuclease treatment with RNase A (1.0\u20130.01 ng), RNase T1 (1.0\u20130.01 U) and RNase V1 (0.1\u20130.001 U) was performed according to manufacturer's instructions.
