{"summary": "the introduction of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) into the u.s. herds was remarkable because of the sheer magnitude of infectivity and impact on animal health and welfare. there is no available data describing the transmission of viruses in either animal or human food manufacturing facilities. biosafety level 2 biocontainment laboratory and animal food manufacturing facility containing pilot scale animal food manufacturing equipment. procedure was approved by the Kansas State University Institutional Biosafety Committee (Approval No. 929.3) animal food was mixed in a 0.113 m3 electric paddle mixer. it was previously validated to mix a 50 kg batch of animal food with CV less than 10%. the animal food was conveyed and exited through a downspout into biohazard bags. eOne sample was analyzed by Ward Laboratories Inc., Kearney, NE. previously-prepared 5 kg of inoculum was added to 45 kg of virus-free animal food in a 0.113 m3 electric paddle mixer. four sequenced 50 kg batches of virus-free animal food were mixed and discharged after the positive control. swabs were categorized by surface (metal, concrete, plastic vs. rubber) within zone (animal food-contact vs. non-animal food contact) plates were then thawed at room temperature, supernatant was pooled according to replicate and treatment for each pig. eighteen pigs were purchased from a conventional breeding farm. pigs were blocked by weight, then randomly divided into groups of 3 per room. pigs were fed liquid milk replacer (Esbilac; PetAg, IL) and commercially pelleted diet. each pig was administered the dust suspension by orogastric gavage. RNA extraction and quantitative PEDV RT-PCR (qPCR) nucleic acids were extracted from a 50 L sample of supernatant. each 96-well extraction run included an extraction positive control (PEDV stock virus) and an extraction negative control (1x PBS) five l of RNA template was used in qPCR setup in a 25 l reaction using a real time RT-PCR kit (Path-ID Multiplex One-Step RT-PCR kit; Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) the stock virus titer contained 4.5 x 106 TCID50/ml, with a corresponding qPCR cycle threshold (Ct) value of 11. the virus was divided into three 500 ml aliquots stored at -80\u00b0C, with one aliquot used per replication. for each replication, an aliquot was thawed overnight at 4\u00b0C. cEach kilogram of premix contains 4,409,171 IU vitamin A, 551,146 IU vitamin D3, 17,637 IU vitamin E, 1,764 mg menadione, 3,300 mg riboflavin, 3,300 mg d-pantothenic acid, 19,841 mg niacin, 15 mg vitamin B12. environmental surfaces were swabbed using foam-tipped disposable swabs. they were pre-wetted with 2 ml of phosphate buffered saline. each swab opened aseptically, and rubbed across the desired surface. designated areas swabbed for PEDV qPCR analysis include high and low foot traffic areas (concrete), drain (concrete), garage door (metal), pellet mill (equipment), table ledge (metal), conveyer (equipment), and food mixer (equipment). eighteen pigs were purchased from a conventional breeding farm and delivered to the Iowa State University Laboratory Animal Resource (LAR) facilities. the 8 ml aliquot combined eight 1-ml dust suspensions sampled from 4 buckets and 4 adjacent belt areas. each pig represented 1 of 3 replicates per treatment and each room represented each treatment. 96-well extraction run included an extraction positive control (PEDV stock virus) and an extraction negative control (1x PBS) four l of RNA template was used in qPCR setup in a 20 l reaction using a real time RT-PCR kit (Path-ID Multiplex One-Step RT-PCR Kit; Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) food-contact and non-animal food-contact surfaces were classified from treatment and surface type. samples considered negative by qPCR were evaluated as significant at P 0.05. food, the mean Ct value of the metal mixer increased through sequence 3. after sequence 2, there was a Ct increase followed by another increase after sequence 2. after sequence 3, Ct values did not differ after sequence 3, however was lower (P 0.05) than after sequence 2. swabs were pre-wetted with 2 ml of PBS. equipment was not cleaned between treatments. swab Ct analysis was replicated 3 times. the food safety modernization act requires animal food manufacturers to identify and control animal food safety hazards because feed is considered animal food and a part of the human food safety system. recent research identified swine food as one of many potential vectors for virus transmission, and confirmed PEDV contaminated foodstuffs may cause disease. norovirus is a known cause of foodborne illness with contamination presumed at point-of-service. however, there is little information regarding norovirus-contaminated food at the manufacturing level due to inadequate surveillance or facility control measures. in pet food manufacturing, equipment surfaces are easy-to-clean with non-porous equipment surfaces selected in order to prevent biofilms or the prevalence of Salmonella spp. or Listeria monocytogenes. other animal food manufacturing facilities have not selected equipment for these purposes due to previously limited risk for biological hazards. environmental surfaces were swabbed for dust after production of PEDV inoculated animal food and animal-food contact surfaces were evaluated for infectivity. the exact cause for lack of infectivity in this study is unknown, but storage time may have impacted virulence in these samples. widespread contamination occurred in an animal food manufacturing facility after PEDV swine food production. the proposed mitigation method of feed batch sequencing was not effective to reduce environmental contamination. the practicality of decontamination is a new challenge facing animal food manufacturing facilities."}
