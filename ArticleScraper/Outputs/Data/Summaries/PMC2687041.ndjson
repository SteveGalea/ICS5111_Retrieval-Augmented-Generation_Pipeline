{"summary": "the study was part of a broader research project approved by the queen\u2019s Research Ethics Board. we retrospectively studied data for July 4, 2004\u2013March 31, 2006. daily counts of discharges of persons with respiratory disease were obtained from the NACRS database. ED CCs in southeastern Ontario strongly correlated in time with NACRS respiratory discharge diagnoses and calls to Telehealth Ontario about respiratory disease. the nature of the EDSS data did not allow us to separate respiratory complaints related to influenza from those related to other pathogens. no large-scale outbreaks have occurred since the inception of our real-time syndromic surveillance system. syndromic surveillance may be able to help healthcare workers recognize a potential outbreak, which theoretically could help them mitigate effects on society earlier."}
