{"summary": "the majority (n = 96) sourced data primarily used by the airline industry. no study was found fully reproducible, although eight were partially reproducible. the global trend is expected to keep rising and reach 1.8 billion arrivals in 2030. lower fares and greater availability make geographically distant destinations easier to reach for a greater number of people. we need to be able to accurately predict international transmission through passenger flow. systematic literature review was designed and conducted. the aim of the review was to determine the data types (e.g. passenger numbers and seat capacity) and sources used for modelling international infectious disease importation. a second aim of the review was to assess reproducibility of those studies regarding sourcing and use of airline passenger data. the full list of abstracts and titles was reviewed and excluded. articles for which an abstract could not be accessed were excluded. the full text of selected articles was accessed and screened for relevance. information Authors At least the first three authors, as on article Text Year of publication Date Title Text Publication name Text Data source Commercial databases collecting information about flight routings, aircraft size, number of bookings or passengers, e.g. IATA, OAG, Diio Yes/no Tourism surveys Any surveys done in the context of tourism, e.g. passenger survey Yes/no Airport published information Data collected and published by airports may be groups of airports Yes/no Government immigration data Data collected by governments on no formal analysis or modelling is performed Yes/no Other None of the above (specify or describe what was done) Yes/no Unclear or unreported Insufficient information to determine data usage Yes/no Pathogen modelled Non-specific Generic model Yes/no MERS coronavirus Yes/no Seasonal influenza Yes/no Seasonal influenza Yes/no Other (specify) Text B.
