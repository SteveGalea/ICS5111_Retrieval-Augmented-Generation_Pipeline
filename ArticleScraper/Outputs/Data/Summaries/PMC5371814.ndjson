{"summary": "the immune system is composed of cellular and humoral components. it can be subdivided into innate immunity [2] and adaptive immunity [3]. recognition of evolutionarily conserved pathogen-derived ligands by the host innate immune system is mediated by pattern recognition receptors. in this review, we describe the intricate interplay between viruses and CLRs. we highlight the role of viruses in antiviral immunity as well as their exploitation by viral pathogens for immune evasion. complex type, or hybrid type, comprises both mannose and GlcNAc attachments. oligomannose type possesses solely mannose residues attached to the core. hybrid type comprises both mannose and GlcNAc attachments. glycan moieties in viral glycoproteins are responsible for a delicate interplay between viruses and host cells through specific interactions with lectins present on the surface of host cells. glycan moieties in viral glycoproteins are often essential for biological functions of viral glycoproteins, such as stability and antigenicity. glycoproteins present in enveloped viruses have a dual role as they contribute to protein folding, viral infectivity, and immune evasion. type N-glycans, gp120 predominantly carries oligomannose N-glycans due to a hindered processing of glycan intermediates by ER and Golgi network glycoenzymes. the crucial role of viral glycosylation in the biology of infection has prompted research on glycan-binding receptors on host immune cells that are capable of recognizing glycan structures on viruses. myeloid CLRs are predominantly expressed by APCs such as monocytes, macrophages, and DCs. this review focuses on myeloid CLRs that are predominantly expressed by APCs such as monocytes, macrophages, and DCs. ent CLRs are classified into four main groups: immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activating motif (ITAM)-bearing CLRs, hemi-ITAM (hemITAM)-bearing CLRs, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM)-bearing CLRs. an intracellular hemITAM motif is found in CLRs such as the FcR chain. activation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells leads to cytokine production and T cell priming. glycans present in viral glycoproteins often leads to virus internalization into APCs. myeloid CLRs can be subdivided in four groups according to their cytoplasmic signaling motifs and early adaptors. hemi-immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activating motif (hemITAM)-coupled; (B) ITAM-coupled; (C) immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM)-coupled; and (D) ITAM-ITIM independent CLRs. ibility complex (MHC) class II and MHC class I molecules are required for efficient priming of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. the T-cell receptor (TCR) recognizes MHC/peptide complexes. the costimulatory molecules CD80/CD86 interact with CD28 expressed by the T cell. DC-SIGN-mediated HIV-1 infection occurs in DCs that then transport virions from sites of HIV-1 exposure to CD4+ T cells in lymphoid tissues. DC-SIGN-mediated HIV-1 infection occurs in DCs that then transport virions from sites of HIV-1 exposure, such as the mucosal membranes or bloodstream, to the proteasome. DC-SIGN-bound HIV-1 virions are non-fusogenically internalized into non-lysosomal endosomes. stability and infectivity of the virions remains intact for several days. augmented viral replication via the DC-SIGN signalosome and triggering of DC apoptosis via ASK-1. ligation of DC-SIGN by gp120 sensitizes DCs to undergo accelerated apoptosis in response to a variety of stimuli. ligation of DC-SIGN by gp120 sensitizes DCs to undergo accelerated apoptosis in response to a variety of stimuli, mediated by excessive activation of the pro-apoptotic molecule apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 ( L-SIGN binds to N-linked high-mannose oligosaccharides, with a binding preference for mannosylated residues. similar to DC-SIGN, L-SIGN is also exploited by several phleboviruses. sialic acid-deficient hamster ovary cell lines were resistant to IAV infection. but pH- and dynamin-dependent infectivity was restored by expression of DC-SIGN/L-SIGN. LSECtin is located on chromosome 19p13.3 in humans, together with DC-SIGN and L-SIGN. LSECtin is a type II transmembrane protein that has a proline-rich short intracellular cytoplasmic domain and an extracellular domain. the cytoplasmic domain of LSECtin comprises a tyrosine motif and diglutamic-containing motifs that mediate EBOV internalization through LSECtin. LSECtin-ligand complexes are not dissociated by a low pH milieu. langerin binds to mannose, fucose, and glcNAc in a ca2+-dependent manner. LCs are highly contagious and have a tropism for lymphocytes and myeloid cells. the role of DCIR in immunity is not yet understood. it may be involved in regulation of DC expansion [95], antigen processing, and antigen presentation for efficient CD4+ and CD8+ T cell priming [96,97]. thropod-borne virus of the family togaviridae causes rheumatic disease in humans characterized by inflammation and damage of musculoskeletal tissues. disease exacerbation in DCIR-/- mice included a more rapid and more severe onset of virus-induced edema. this study suggests a protective role for murine DCIR in limiting CHIKV-induced inflammation. infections with DV may lead to the development of dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. DV was shown to bind to DV and activate a signaling cascade accompanied by the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. DV activates nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) in murine mononuclear phagocytes to enhance tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- production. antibody-mediated MDL-1 blockade inhibited JEV-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine release from microglia and prevented bystander damage to neuronal cells. treatment with an anti-MDL-1 antibody reduced the infiltration of leukocytes into the central nervous system, attenuated neuroinflammation, and decreased JEV-induced lethality in mice. the MMR is a CLR expressed by monocyte-derived DCs, dermal DCs, macrophages, and hepatic endothelial cells. it is involved in innate immunity by recognition of glycan structures on pathogens as well as in homeostasis by clearance of the pituitary hormones lutropin and thyrotropin. DV infection of human macrophages was effectively blocked by anti-MR antibodies. MMR bound to influenza virus via its CRDs in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Interestingly, influenza virus also bound to sialic acid residues present on the MMR. EBOV surface glycoprotein (GP) is highly N- and O-glycosylated and engages in viral attachment and entry into host cells. GP1 is associated with interactions with cell surface receptors to mediate viral entry. GP2 facilitates fusion of viral and host membranes at low pH. a different type of exploitation is mediated by viruses, such as DV, through interaction with myeloid DAP-12 associating lectin (MDL-1) in this case, viruses elicit an exacerbated pro-inflammatory response, that damages host cells and increases the susceptibility for viral infection. membrane GlcNAc Mannose Fucose Inhibit viral infection HIV gp120 [85,88] Enable viral infection MV F and H protein [90] IAV HA [91] MMR Transmembrane GlcNAc Mannose Fucose IAV HA or NA [123,124] HIV gp120 [119,121] DV E protein [122] HBV HBsAg [93,99] Inhibit viral infection CHKV DC-SIGN is composed of a short cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane region, a flexible neck domain involved in oligomerization, and a Ca2+-dependent CRD. the neck domain of DC-SIGN enables the formation of tetramers, thus increasing the binding avidity to glycoconjugates present on the T cell surface. DC-SIGN-mediated HIV-1 infection occurs in DCs that then transport virions from sites of HIV-1 exposure to CD4+ T cells in lymphoid tissues. DC-SIGN-mediated HIV-1 infection occurs in DCs that then transport virions from sites of HIV-1 exposure, such as the mucosal membrane or bloodstream, to CD4+ T cells. DC-SIGN-bound HIV-1 virions are non-fusogenically internalized into non-lysosomal endosomes. stability and infectivity of the virions remains intact for several days. DC-SIGN is also exploited for evasion of the immune response. in mature DCs, protection of HIV-1 virions from endocytosis occurs to a greater extent compared to immature DCs. ligation of DC-SIGN by gp120 sensitizes DCs to undergo accelerated apoptosis in response to a variety of stimuli, mediated by excessive activation of the pro-apoptotic molecule apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1. L-SIGN expression is restricted to endothelial cells present in lymph nodes, placenta, and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. binds to N-linked high-mannose oligosaccharides, with a binding preference for mannosylated residues. similar to DC-SIGN, L-SIGN is also exploited by several viruses. DC-SIGN and L-SIGN were shown to act either as attachment factors for viruses or as authentic entry receptors involved in membrane fusion. LSECtin liver and lymph node sinusoidal endothelial cell C-type lectin (LSECtin, or CLEC4G) is located on chromosome 19p13.3 in humans. viral interactions with LSECtin were not competitively inhibited by the mannose-containing polysaccharide mannan. similarities between LSECtin and DC-SIGN in viral recognition range from the expression of this CLR by endothelial cells to the interaction with viral glycoproteins. LSECtin-ligand complexes are not dissociated by a low pH milieu. langerin is a type II transmembrane protein that has a proline-rich short intracellular cytoplasmic domain and an extracellular domain consisting of a neck-region that forms homo-trimers. langerin is uniquely expressed by LCs in humans, but langerin-positive dermal DCs in mice also identified. langerin may rather be involved in immunity to MV as both immature and mature LCs efficiently presented MV-derived antigens to CD4+ T cells [90]. the role of DCIR in immunity is not yet understood, but it may be involved in regulation of DC expansion [95], antigen processing, and antigen presentation. CHIKV is an arthropod-borne virus of the family togaviridae. it causes rheumatic disease in humans characterized by inflammation and damage of musculoskeletal tissues. this increased expression of DCIR by CD4+ T cells enhances HIV-1 attachment, viral entry, replication and transfer. DV, a mosquito-borne virus of the family Flaviviridae, is the causative agent of dengue fever. infections with DV may lead to the development of dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. antibody-mediated MDL-1 blockade inhibited JEV-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine release from microglia and prevented bystander damage to neuronal cells. anti-MDL-1 antibody reduced infiltration of leukocytes into central nervous system, attenuated neuroinflammation, and decreased JEV-induced lethality in mice. the MMR is a CLR expressed by monocyte-derived DCs, dermal DCs, macrophages, and hepatic endothelial cells. it is involved in innate immunity by recognition of glycan structures on pathogens as well as in homeostasis by clearance of the pituitary hormones lutropin and thyrotropin. DV infection of human macrophages was effectively blocked by anti-MR antibodies. MMR bound to influenza virus via its CRDs in a Ca2+-dependent manner. endocytic uptake of influenza virus into macrophages was reduced. EBOV surface glycoprotein (GP) is highly N- and O-glycosylated. GP is cleaved into the GP1 and GP2 subunits by furin. GP1 is associated with interactions with cell surface receptors. GP2 facilitates fusion of viral and host membranes at low pH. a comprehensive overview of the role of CLRs in viral recognition and immune responses is shown in Table 1. the role of myeloid C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) in viral infection. proteins [65] WNV E protein or prM protein [71] DV E protein [48] MARV Envelope glycoproteins [49] SARS-CoV S protein [49] Langerin Transmembrane GlcNAc Mannose Fucose Inhibit viral infection HIV gp120 [85,88] Enable viral infection MV F and H protein [90] IAV HA [91] MMR Transmembrane GlcNAc Mannose Fuco glycan-based carrier systems have gained increased attention in the last years. multivalent ligand display using different scaffolds has been employed. DC-SIGN acts as an authentic entry receptor for a diverse range of viruses. strategies towards DC-SIGN using multivalent glycan-based carrier systems have gained a remarkable emphasis. the rationale of such strategies is the mimicry of the glycan presentation at the viral surface as the basis for glycan-based antiviral agents. a globular glycofullerene decorated with 120 peripheral glycan subunits mimicking glycan display on viruses. a multi-layered conjugation approached described by Ribeiro-Viana et al. enabled a high density of glycan display on glycodendrinanoparticles resulting in an efficient inhibition of EBOV infection of DCs and T cells at picomolar concentrations. glycan array technology provides a robust and reliable platform to identify potential glycan recognition events involved in virus attachment and entry. in an integrated approach, Khatri et al. studied the HA glycosylation sites of IAV, often affected by mutations that impair vaccine development. this approach enabled to elucidate IAV\u2013host interactions and helped to understand the evolutionary selective pressure of the host immune system in virus evolution."}
