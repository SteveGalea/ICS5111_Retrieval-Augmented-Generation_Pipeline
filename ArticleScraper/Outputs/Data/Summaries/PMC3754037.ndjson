{"summary": "IBDV belongs to the Birnaviridae family, which groups economically important pathogens. Segment A contains two partially overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) the first ORF encodes the nonessential nonstructural viral protein 5 (VP5) (2). the second ORF encodes a polyprotein that is cotranslationally self-cleaved by the viral protease VP4. RNA viruses replicate their genome in intracellular membranes of infected cells (12, 13), integrated into a complex structure known as the \u201cviral factory\u201d. the viral replication machinery is usually inserted into single- or double-membrane vesicles that can be associated with a variety of organelles. the IBDV Soroa strain, a virulent serotype 1 virus, was propagated in QM7 quail muscle cells. human epithelial HeLa cells and avian fibroblast QM7 cells were grown at 37\u00b0C in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Purified mouse anti-early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1) and anti-GM130 were obtained from BD Biosciences (Becton, Dickinson, Argentina) monoclonal rat anti-lysosome-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP-2) and mouse anti-tubulin were obtained from the developmental studies Hybridoma Bank (DSHB, USA) pcDNAVP3wt is a derivative of the pcDNA3 eukaryotic expression vector (Invitrogen) that contains the VP3 coding sequence. the acidic compartment marker LysoTracker Red DND-99 and the self-quenched Bodipy dye conjugated to bovine serum albumin (Bodipy-DQ-BSA) were obtained from Molecular Probes (Life Technologies, Argentina) acidic compartments were labeled with LysoTracker by incubating cells with 1 M LysoTracker at 37\u00b0C for 60 min. cells were washed and left an additional 60 min with fresh medium without the probe. tests of lysosomal function by degradation of chromogenic BSA. bands were detected by using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit from Healthcare (catalog number RPN2109; Amersham), and the data were collected with an LAS-4000 imaging system (Fujifilm, Japan). the protein band intensities from three independent experiments were quantitated with Adobe Photoshop CS5 software. the data in the figures represent the means and standard deviations obtained after analyzing 50 cells per condition from three independent experiments. the two-dimensional (2D) and 3D reconstructions were performed with ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health) l containing 1 PCR buffer II (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies, USA), 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP), 20 U RNase inhibitor, 50 U murine leukemia virus (MuLV) reverse transcriptase. transcript levels were determined by real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR), using a StepOne real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies, USA DV Soroa strain, a virulent serotype 1 virus, was propagated in QM7 quail muscle cells (ATCC CRL-1962) as previously described (20). human epithelial HeLa cells and avian fibroblast QM7 cells were grown at 37\u00b0C in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM); whole rabbit antiserum immunized with recombin nal mouse anti-lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA) was a gift from J. Gruenberg (Department of Biochemistry, University of Geneva, Switzerland) secondary goat anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated with Alexa 488 or Cy3, donkey anti-mouse antibodies conjugated with Cy3 and goat anti-rat antibodies conjugated with Cy3 and Hoechst 33342 were purchased from Molecular Probes. pcDNAVP3wt is a derivative of the pcDNA3 eukaryotic expression vector (Invitrogen) that contains the VP3 coding sequence. the acidic compartment marker LysoTracker Red DND-99 and the self-quenched Bodipy dye conjugated to bovine serum albumin were obtained from Molecular Probes. self-quenched dye conjugated to DQ-BSA was used to measure lysosomal degradative function. cells were incubated for 12 h at 37\u00b0C with DQ-BSA (10 g/ml in complete culture medium) cells were fixed and analyzed by CLSM. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. all immunofluorescence procedures were carried out at room temperature. cells were fixed with a 3% paraformaldehyde solution in PBS for 15 min. transfected cells were permeabilized with 0.05% saponin in PBS. infected cells were titrated with 1 ml of DMEM, subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles, and then centrifuged to eliminate cellular detritus. total RNA was extracted from 1 107 cells by using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's recommendations. transcript levels were determined by real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR), using a StepOne real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies, USA) amplifications were performed with a final volume of 20 l containing 10 l of 2 Power SYBR green PCR Master Mix (including AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase, dNTPs, and SYBR green dye) we analyzed the progression of the infection by determining the levels of VP3 accumulation by Western blotting, the presence and subcellular distribution of VP3 by immunofluorescence, and extracellular viral titers. at 36 h p.i., almost all of the cells were clearly infected without a widespread cytopathic effect. infection of human HeLa or avian QM7 cells was carried out with the virus at a MOI of 1 PFU/cell. at 36 h p.i., cells were processed for immunofluorescence analysis using anti-VP3 antibodies and analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. antibody or overexpressed proteins were used in double-labeling IF studies. we used antibodies against lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA), an acidic lipid found in late endosomes. cells overexpressing EGFP-Rab7 or untransfected HeLa cells were infected. a normal distribution of endocytic markers was observed in infected cells. in untransfected HeLa cells, double immune staining was performed with the corresponding endosomal marker as indicated. the nuclei are stained with Hoechst stain (blue) the insets show the colocalization of VP3 with the cellular marker in the perinuclear region. infected HeLa cells were processed for double immune staining with anti-VP1 (1:300) or anti-VP3 (1:500) as well as the corresponding Alexa 488 (green signal)-conjugated secondary antibodies and the corresponding Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies. the nuclei were stained with Hoechst stain (blue) the insets show colocalization of the proteins in the perinuclear region. images are representative of three independent experiments. a mouse monoclonal antibody specific for dsRNA has been successfully employed to visualize dsRNA in infected cells. a functional endocytic pathway is required for virus replication. a mutation that renders a protein defective in GTP binding (i.e., Rab5S34N) leads to small endosomes and inhibition of endocytosis. recombinant VP3 localizes to early endosomes. QM7 and HeLa cells were transfected with pcDNA-VP3. VP3 localization was analyzed by IF at 24 h posttransfection. cells were processed for indirect immunofluorescence analysis with anti-VP3 (1/500) double immune staining was performed with anti-EEA1. pcDNA-VP3-transfected cells were incubated with LysoTracker or DQ-BSA. nuclei were stained with Hoechst stain (blue) VP3 was strongly associated with CTR433 at the juxtanuclear region. overlap between VP3 and the two analyzed Golgi marker signals was never observed. insets show the strong association of VP3 (green signal) and the Golgi markers (red signal) at the perinuclear region. s of SialT2 and GalNAcT fused to YFP (43) were transfected into HeLa or QM7 cells. transfected cells were then infected, and VP3 expression was detected by immunostaining. a similar observation was made with avian cells. pYFP-SialT2- and pYFP-GalNAcT-transfected cells were infected. the nuclei were stained with Hoechst stain (blue) the nuclei were stained with Hoechst stain (blue) white arrows indicate VP3-positive and EEA1-positive vesicles in close proximity to the Golgi stacks (green signal) images are representative of three independent experiments. a marked change in the VP3 pattern upon ND treatment was observed. in the large majority of YFP-GalNAcT- and YFP-SialT2-expressing infected cells, we observed a strong association of VP3 and the Golgi ministacks forming cup-shaped structures. a marked change in the VP3 subcellular distribution was observed upon cell treatment with ND. insets show a well-defined association of both structures. complete VP3/actin values are 1.36 0.02, 1.32 0.04, 1.37 0.06, and 1.41 0.05. brefeldin A treatment of infected avian cells affects virus assembly. a strong change in the VP3 pattern upon BFA treatment was observed. levels of VP3 expression were analyzed by immunoblotting. a significant reduction of the VP3 expression level was observed in treated HeLa and QM7 cells. infected HeLa and QM7 cells were treated with 5 g/ml brefeldin A (BFA) or left in control medium. at 36 h p.i., cells were washed and processed for indirect immunofluorescence analysis. HeLa or QM7 cells were infected for different time periods with the IBDV Soroa strain at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 PFU/cell. but when possible, we also carried out the experiments with QM7 cells. we analyzed the progression of the infection by determining levels of VP3 accumulation by Western blotting. the IBDV VP3 protein colocalizes with endocytic markers at the perinuclear region in infected cells. at 36 h p.i., cells were processed for immunofluorescence analysis using anti-VP3 antibodies and analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. we analyzed the colocalization of VP3 with Rab7, a protein specifically related to degradative compartments such as late endosomes and lysosomes. the level of colocalization of the VP3 polypeptide with EGFP-Rab7 was relatively high. transfected or untransfected HeLa cells were infected with anti-VP3 (1:500) and the corresponding Alexa 488-conjugated (green signal in untransfected cells) or Cy3-conjugated (red signal in EGFP-Rab5 [e to h]-, EGFP-Rab7 [i to l]-, and EGFP\u2013LAMP-1 [u to x]-transfected cells) secondary antibodies we analyzed the subcellular localization of two additional IBDV RNP elements. the polymerase VP1 was analyzed by using a specific rabbit antiserum. for comparative purposes, VP3 was also analyzed in the same experiment. -dsRNA antibody and the corresponding Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies were stained with Hoechst stain (blue) the insets show colocalization of the proteins in the perinuclear region. images are representative of three independent experiments. the viral components VP3, VP3 and dsRNA colocalize in endocytic structures located in the juxtanuclear region of infected cells. a functional endocytic pathway is required for virus replication. infected cells were transfected with pEGFP, pEGFP-Rab5wt, or pEGFP-Rab5S34N. at 12 h p.i., both intra- and extracellular IBDV titers were determined. data represent results for the media from two independent experiments. QM7 and HeLa cells were transfected with pcDNA or pcDNA-VP3, as described in Materials and Methods. at 24 h p.i., cells were processed for indirect immunofluorescence analysis with anti-VP3 (1/500). in HeLa cells, double immune staining was performed with anti-EEA1. VP3 was strongly associated with GM130 (red signal) at the juxtanuclear region. overlap between VP3 and the two analyzed Golgi marker signals was never observed. double labeling was performed with anti-GM130 (A) or anti-CTR433 (B) alT2 (GM32,8-sialyltransferase or GD3 synthase) and galNAcT (GM3/GD3 1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase) these enzymes concentrate at the proximal or cis- and trans-Golgi networks, respectively (42) the N-terminal domains of SialT2 and GalNAcT fused to YFP (43) double immune staining of VP3 and EEA1 in YFP-SialT2-transfected cells was performed. results suggest that VP3-containing endosomal structures associate with the Golgi stacks in infected cells. yFP-SialT2-transfected, IBDV-infected HeLa cells were stained with Hoechst stain (blue) different rotation planes of the same data were displayed as 3D topographical reconstructions of VP3 and YFP-SialT2. arrows indicate VP3-positive and EEA1-positive vesicles in close proximity to the golgi stacks (green signal) cells were processed for Western blotting to detect viral VP3 levels. we used the YFP-GalNAcT and YFP-SialT2 Golgi complex markers. a marked change in the VP3 pattern upon ND treatment was observed. mM nocodazole (ND) cells were washed and processed for indirect immunofluorescence analysis. only ND-treated HeLa cells are shown. the nuclei were stained with Hoechst stain (blue) a strong change in the VP3 pattern upon BFA treatment was observed. levels of VP3 expression were analyzed by immunoblotting. however, when quantified intra- and extracellular virus titers, we found no differences in the formation and release of infective particles. infected cells were treated with 5 g/ml brefeldin A (BFA) or left in control medium. at 36 h p.i., cells were washed and processed for indirect immunofluorescence analysis. birnaviruses are nonenveloped viruses with a genome encapsidated by two protein shells, an outer capsid and an inner core shell. rotavirus factories are intimately associated with the microtubule network (50), and rotavirus factories are composed of electron-dense viroplasm often in proximity to membranes derived from the ER (51). infected cells labeled with anti-VP3, anti-VP1, or anti-dsRNA showed a perinuclear punctate pattern, concentrated mostly on one side of the nucleus, compatible with a vesicular pattern. our results suggest that VP3 localizes to modified membranous compartments belonging to the endocytic pathway. 3D surface reconstruction imaging showed VP3 is not inside the stacks. the involvement of the Golgi apparatus in virus assembly has been described for transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) (53), the prototype member of the Bunyaviridae family (54), and rubella virus (RUBV) (55) a marked change in the VP3 subcellular pattern shows a punctate distribution scattered throughout the cytoplasm of infected cells with a strong association of VP3-containing vesicles and VP3 forming cup-shaped structures. this observation constitutes strong evidence of a physical association between VP3-containing vesicles and VP3-containing vesicles. avian cells (such as QM7 cells) are the natural target for efficient replication. we found a reduction in intracellular virus titers in BFA-treated. this suggests a role for the Golgi apparatus in the assembly step of the IBDV life cycle. birnaviruses lack the typical T=2 core, where viral RNA metabolism of all dsRNA viruses takes place. birnaviruses lack the typical T=2 core, where viral RNA metabolism of all dsRNA viruses takes place. birnaviruses lack the typical T=2 core, where viral RNA metabolism takes place. IBDV VP3 is a scaffolding protein that accomplishes several tasks during viral replication and morphogenesis. the VP3-associated activities have been located in its C-terminal region. VP3 interacts with the viral dsRNA, forming RNP complexes reminiscent of those of certain dsDNA viruses (6). the presence of polybasic clusters in the protein sequence of VP3 was analyzed by using BioEdit (65). the interaction of small clusters of positively charged amino acids on proteins with negatively charged lipids in membranes constitutes an important issue in the field of protein-membrane interactions (66). our results suggest that VP3 localizes to modified membranous compartments belonging to the endocytic pathway. in infected cells, modified endosomes and lysosomes constitute special vesicular structures, known as cytopathic vacuoles (CPVs) studies of RUBV assembly revealed two new aspects of virion assembly. the polymorphism of virus particles detected inside the Golgi complex strongly suggested the existence of a structural maturation process that takes place in the Golgi stacks. this suggests a potential physical connection between the sites of viral replication and virion assembly (55) VP3-containing vesicles and VP3 stacks formed cup-shaped structures. this is a strong evidence of a physical association between vesicles and golgi stacks. in the control situation, the level of production of infectious viral particles in HeLa cells is always markedly lower than that in QM7 cells. chicken heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and the 41 integrin are components of the cellular receptor complex mediating IBDV infection (29, 57). we have indeed analyzed the internalization of IBDV, and our preliminary results indicate that IBDV is endocytosed and that a functional endocytic pathway is critical for viral infection (17). birnaviruses lack the typical T=2 core, where viral RNA metabolism of all dsRNA viruses takes place. birnaviruses lack the typical T=2 core, where viral RNA metabolism of all dsRNA viruses takes place. birnaviruses lack the typical T=2 core, where viral RNA metabolism of all dsRNA viruses takes place. s associated with the endocytic vesicles could traffic along microtubules to reach the perinuclear region. VP3 is a scaffolding protein that accomplishes several tasks during viral replication and morphogenesis, with a highly hydrophilic C-terminal tail region rich in charged amino acids and proline residues. VP3 interacts with the viral dsRNA, forming RNP complexes reminiscent of those of certain dsDNA VP3 was analyzed by using BioEdit (65). the interaction of small clusters of positively charged amino acids on proteins with negatively charged lipids in membranes constitutes an important issue in the field of protein-membrane interactions."}
