{"summary": "study identified the major medical causes for dogs visiting primary-care veterinary clinics in the Republic of Korea, stratified by age and breed. otitis externa, dermatitis or eczema, vomiting, and diarrhea were common medical problems. the information from this study could enable the creation of strategies for preventing diseases and enable the identification of health problems for more effective disease management in companion dogs. companion animals have become an important part of the modern family. mixed breed dogs have a higher average lifespan than purebred dogs. male dogs tended to have higher mortality rates due to trauma. female dogs showed higher rates of neoplasms. breed and age are major risk factors for mortality in dogs. a total of 44,782 medical records of canine patients were analyzed from 11 selected primary-care veterinary clinics, for the period from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016. data collection Participating primary veterinary clinics in this study were randomly selected after an interview with the practitioner. the classification includes two general categories of ICD for human disease. clinical notes and diagnosis terms included in the data were reviewed in detail. most definitive diagnostic term recorded for each disorder within an individual patient\u2019s record was manually classified using the ICD from the World Health Organization. age was divided into seven groups; 1 year, 1\u20133 years, 4\u20136 years, 7\u20139 years, 10\u201312 years, 13\u201315 years, >16 years of age. the top 20 most common disorders were analyzed, according to age groups. o-gu and the six primary veterinary clinics are in Wanshan-gu and Deokjin-gu in Jeonju (metropolitan city located middle-western in ROK) the data included clinical information, such as presenting signs or diagnoses of major health problems, reasons for the visit, and related clinical procedures. otitis externa was classified as \"Diseases of the ear or mastoid process\" heartworm was classified as \"Certain infectious or parasitic diseases\" otitis externa was classified as \"Diseases of the ear or mastoid process,\" and heartworm was classified as \"Certain infectious or parasitic diseases\" only six dog breeds (Maltese, Poodle, Pomeranian, Shih Tzu, Yorkshire Terrier, Chihuahua) were used in the final analysis. each of the presenting signs or diagnoses was analyzed, stratified by breeds, to investigate the prevalence of diseases. six small/toy breeds comprised 67.7% of the total dogs investigated. the most popular breeds (including mixed breeds) visited small animal clinics. otitis externa 8.8% (95% CI [7.8\u201317.5]) was the most common medical problem, followed by dermatitis or eczema 8.5% (95% CI [7.5\u20139.6]) and preventive medicine 7.7% (95% CI [1.5\u20132.6]) ary tumors occurred more often than in other age groups. ranked 1 year 1\u20133 years 4\u20136 years 7\u20139 years 10\u201312 years 13\u201315 years >16 year 1 Preventive medicine 39 (31.1\u201347.3) Preventive medicine 16.7 (15.9\u201317.5) Otitis externa 8.8 (7.8\u201310.0) Dermatitis or eczema 9.2 (7.9\u201310.7) Dermatitis or eczema 7.4 (5.9 externa 5.5 (5.0\u20136.0) Vomiting 4.5 (3.7\u20135.3) Preventive medicine 4.1 (3.2\u20135.1) URTD 3.7 (2.7\u20134.9) URTD 3.5 (2.5\u20134.7) Kidney failure 3.8 (2.1\u20136.6) 6 Lameness 2.9 (0.9\u20137.8) Dermatitis or eczema 5.1 (4.6\u20135.6) Lameness 3.2 (2.5\u20133.9) Vomiting 3.9 (3.0\u20135.0) Health services skin Pruritus 2 (1.7\u20132.3) Dermatomycoses 2.3 (1.8\u20133.0) URTD 2.1 (1.4\u20132.9) Heart disease 2.2 (1.4\u20133.2) Kidney failure 2.4 (1.6\u20133.5) Mammary tumor 2.7 (1.3\u20135.1) 12 Wound 1.5 (1.4\u20132.3) Dermatomycoses 2.1 (1.4\u20133.1) Pyoderma 2.1 (1.4\u20133.2) Respiratory disorder 2.4 (1.1\u20134.7) 13 Parvovirus infection 1.5 ( appetite 2 (1.2\u20133.0) Wound 1.8 (0.7\u20134.0) URTD 1.5 (1.0\u20132.0) Wound 1.6 (1.0\u20132.3) Keratitis 1.6 (1.0\u20132.5) Mammary tumor 2 (1.2\u20133.0) Disorders of orbit 1.8 (0.7\u20134.0) 18 Patella luxation 0.7 (0.04\u20134.6) Tooth extraction 1.1 (0.8\u20131.3) Foreign body ingestion 1.5 (1.0\u20132.0) Neutering surgery 1.5 (0.9\u20132.2) Traum the major reasons for visiting the clinics were preventive medicine 10.3% (95% CI [9.3\u201315.9]), otitis externa 8.8% (95% CI [7.9\u20139.7]) and dermatitis or eczema 6.9% (CI [6.1\u20137.7]). for Poodles, preventive medicine 14.5% (95% CI [7.2\u20139.4]) was most common reason for visiting vet clinic.

dogs aged 10 years old (17.3%) also showed a high proportion. around 6.62 million dogs are present in the ROK. maltese was the most popular breed (21.2%), followed by poodle (11.4%), mixed breed (6.1%), Yorkshire terrier (5.2%) and pomeranian (5.1%). the most affected organ systems were the integument, digestive, and musculoskeletal systems in the study by O\u2019Neill et al. in the UK (2015). the most affected organ systems were the integument, digestive, and musculoskeletal systems in the study. some types of progressive or degenerative diseases had a higher prevalence in older groups than in younger groups. such as circulation disorders (e.g., heart disease), neoplasms (e.g., mammary tumors), musculoskeletal disorders (e.g., lameness), and hormonal disorders (e.g., Cushing\u2019s disease). some types of canine patients with class I heart disease have no clinical signs. this disease status can change frequently and dramatically over short periods of time. previous studies have described neoplasia as the most important risk factor for mortality in older dogs. a significant proportion of dogs had no vaccinations (32%) and no prevention against external parasites (47%) or internal parasites (31%) during a campaign for improving preventive medicine in Belgium. regular preventive medicines would help decrease mortality and morbidity, especially for some kinds of infectious disease. the most common presenting signs or diagnoses of skin disease were pruritus, swellings, and alopecia in a previous study. dermatitis or eczema (6.4%) was the most common sign followed by erythema and/or pruritus, dermatomycoses, pyoderma, mass and/or nodule, alopecia, and allergic dermatitis. major medical causes for visiting veterinary clinic by breeds We analyzed the frequency and distribution of medical problems in six breeds (Maltese, Poodle, Pomeranian, Shih Tzu, Yorkshire Terrier, and Chihuahua) common causes for visiting the veterinary clinic were similar across these breeds. dermatitis or eczema, malassezia infection in skin, dermatomycoses, skin pruritus, and pyoderma show high prevalence across breeds. some purebred dogs could be affected by various endogenous risk factors, such as hyperadrenocorticism in Poodle, hypothyroidism in Doberman Pinscher, and zinc-responsive skin diseases in Cocker Spaniel and Alaskan malamute. a is known to be related to skin diseases; it exhibits breed predisposition, with excessive hair in and around ear, typically in long-coated breeds. the incidence of otitis externa in this study supports the assumption that it is a breed-related condition (p 0.001) a comprehensive, representative survey of the entire ROK is considered relevant for indoor dogs living in big cities. it is aimed at primary veterinary clinics in Seoul, the largest city in ROK, and Jeonju, a smaller city. if signs alone were considered, some of the most frequently encountered breed-specific and congenital problems would be missed because owners might not recognize them. veterinary EMR data have been proposed as a statistically valuable source of information for clinical research in dogs. they provide a wide range of comprehensive information, and they allow a wide range of multi-dimensional analyses. the system is convenient for storing and sorting patient information. dermatitis or eczema was the most common medical problem for both age and breeds in this study. the most common age for visiting vet clinics was 1\u20133 years (53.0%); dogs aged 10 years old (17.3%) also showed a high proportion. the 1-year-old population was a lower proportion of our total. maltese was the most popular breed (21.2%), followed by Shih Tzu (11.7%), poodle (11.4%), mixed breed (6.1%), Yorkshire terrier (5.2%), and pomeranian (5.1%). a general trend for small breeds to have a longer expected life span than large breeds. dental diseases, such as gingivitis, were significantly lower in our study. skin diseases were most common, followed by digestive diseases, preventive medicine, ear diseases, and diseases of the visual and musculoskeletal systems. in our study, skin diseases were most common, followed by digestive diseases, preventive medicine, ear diseases, and diseases of the visual and musculoskeletal systems. some types of progressive or degenerative diseases had a higher prevalence in older groups than in younger groups. the prevalence of heart diseases increases with age in small breed dogs. dogs older than eight years have a reduced survival time compared to younger dogs. neoplasia is the most important risk factor for mortality in older dogs. tumors of the mammary gland were the most common type, with a mean percentage of malignancy of 50.9% in female dogs. a significant proportion of dogs had no vaccinations (32%) and no prevention against external parasites (47%) or internal parasites (31%) during a campaign for improving preventive medicine in Belgium. regular preventive medicines would help decrease mortality and morbidity, especially for some kinds of infectious disease. the most common presenting signs or diagnoses of skin disease were pruritus, swellings, and alopecia. dermatitis or eczema (6.4%) was the most common sign followed by erythema and/or pruritus, dermatomycoses, pyoderma, mass and/or nodule, alopecia, and allergic dermatitis. major medical causes for visiting veterinary clinic by breeds We analyzed the frequency and distribution of medical problems in six breeds (Maltese, Poodle, Pomeranian, Shih Tzu, Yorkshire Terrier, and Chihuahua) the main breeds in ROK are small dogs and toy dogs. common causes for visiting the veterinary clinic were similar across these breeds. dermatomycoses, skin pruritus, and pyoderma show high prevalence across breeds. a previous report noted that some purebred dogs could be affected by various endogenous risk factors, such as hyperadrenocorticism in Poodle, hypothyroidism in Doberman Pinscher, and zinc-responsive skin diseases in Cocker Spaniel and Alaskan malamute. the incidence of otitis externa in this study supports the assumption that it is a breed-related condition (p 0.001). we observed that, for Shih Tzu, orbital problems, including conjunctivitis, disorder of the orbit (unspecified) and keratitis were more frequent than in other breeds; we suspect this is because of persistent irritation of the cornea or conjunctiva by eyelashes or facial hair. if signs alone were considered when observing cases in veterinary clinics, some of the most frequently encountered breed-specific and congenital problems would be missed because owners might not recognize them. regular visits to the veterinarian for health screening can help identify undetected problems and allow better treatment and management of some problems in earlier stages. data: Dates of visits to the veterinary clinic;
