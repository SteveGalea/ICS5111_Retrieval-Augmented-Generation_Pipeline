{"summary": "diphyllin and bafilomycin are potent vacuolar ATPase inhibitors previously shown to have broad-spectrum antiviral activity. their poor water solubility and potential off-target effect limit their clinical application. amantadine is the first synthetic compound that inhibits influenza virus replication. it inhibits matrix-2 ion channels to block migration of H+ ions into the interior of the virus particles. resistance to these compounds has been widely reported. several V-ATPase inhibitors have been studied, including plecomacrolide bafilomycin. these compounds have shown antiviral potentials but their clinical application is thwarted by toxicity concerns. a new class of the V-ATPase inhibitor,12 is effective in blocking influenza virus infection. cellular uptake of the nanoparticles was assessed in two different influenza virus-permissive cell lines, including MH-S and ARPE-19. the host-targeted treatment can be applied to multiple strains of influenza viruses and successfully reduced disease severity in a mouse model of influenza virus infection. influenza A virus was propagated in the allantoic cavity of 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs. the viral titer was determined as below. preparation of V-ATPase inhibitor-loaded nanoparticles Diphyllin or bafilomycin was encapsulated into a PEG-functionalized PLGA nanoparticle. 10 L nanoparticles were added to glow-discharged grid and the droplet was placed on the grid for 30 seconds. ddH2O was applied to the grid to wash away the excessive nanoparticles. each measurement was made with 1 mL of the nanoparticles at 1 mg/mL in water. a set of dialysis tubes were loaded with drug-loaded nanoparticles containing 0.05 mg of diphyllin or bafilomycin. the tubes were then placed in a tank of phosphate buffer or acetate buffer. the nanoparticle samples were then dissolved with acetone, and the drug contents were analyzed by HPLC. MH-S cells were grown on a 96-well clear polystyrene microplate at a density of 20,000 cells per well 1 day prior to the experiment. free drugs or drug-loaded nanoparticles were serially diluted in cell media and added to the cell monolayer in four replicates. the IC50 of free drugs or drug-loaded nanoparticles were determined using GraphPad. the cells were pretreated 1 hour with free drugs or drug-loaded nanoparticles. after infection, viruses were removed and the cells were washed. two mice of each group were sacrificed on day 5 postviral infection. mice were harvested and homogenated in the infection medium. viral load was determined by quantitative RT-PCR. two milliliters of 0.3% agarose in infection medium was added to each well. after 72 hours of incubation, the cells were fixed with 10% formalin for 30 minutes. the cells were stained with 1% crystal violet at room temperature for 15 minutes. cells and viruses MDCK (Madin \u2013 Darby canine kidney) cells were maintained in the DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin B (PSA) MH-S cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 2-mercaptoethanol to a final concentration of 0.05 mM, FBS to a final concentration of 10%, and 1% PSA. 0.5 mg of diphyllin or bafilomycin was dissolved with 20 mg of PEG-PLGA diblock copolymers (Sigma #764760) in 1 mL of chloroform. solution was added to 5 mL of 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) and dispersed using a probe sonicator for 1 minute 30 seconds with 50% power to form the single emulsion. 10 L nanoparticles were added to glow-discharged grid and the droplet was placed on the grid for 30 seconds. the grid was stained with 10 L of 1% uranyl acetate for 30 seconds. the staining was removed by wicking with a piece of filter paper. drug-loaded nanoparticles were harvested from dialysis tubes at 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours, 23 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours. cellular uptake studies MH-S cells and ARPE-19 cells were seeded in 8-well chamber slides 1 day prior to the experiment. MH-S cells were seeded on 96-well microplates 1 day before the experiment. free drugs or drug-loaded nanoparticles were serially diluted in cell media. after 72 hours of incubation, 5 L of alamarBlue reagent was added to each well to evaluate the cellular viability. mice were infected with influenza virus (H1N1, MOI=1; H3N2, MOI=5) after infection, viruses were removed and the cells were washed. the supernatant was harvested to assess the viral titer. the samples were tenfold serially diluted with infection medium. 100 L of the diluted samples was added to the cells and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour. after 72 hours of incubation, the supernatant was harvested to perform the direct hemagglutination assay spot assay with 1% chicken RBCs. cDNA was synthesized using the QuantiNova Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen NV, Venlo, the Netherlands) the 20 L reaction mixture was prepared by mixing 500 nM of primers M1-F and primer M1-R, and 250 nM of FAM-labeled probe. the cycling protocol in a thermal cycler consisted of 3 minutes of preheating at 95\u00b0C and followed by 45 cycles of 15 seconds of denaturation at 95\u00b0 the standard curve was constructed with serially diluted samples of diphyllin (0.125, 0.03125, 0.0078125, and 0.001953125 mg/mL) the peak detection of diphyllin appeared at 9.9 minutes. in this study, the averaged loading efficiency of diphyllin was 42%. the quantification of bafilomycin loading in nanoparticles was determined by HPLC. the standard curve was constructed with serially diluted samples of bafilomycin (0.5, 0.25, 0.125, 0.0625, and 0.03125 mg/mL) both nanoparticulate V-ATPase inhibitors showed similar physicochemical properties. 12% of bafilomycin was released in the acidic buffer in the first 6 hours. after 23 hours, 36% of bafilomycin was released in the acidic buffer. 24% of bafilomycin was released in the phosphate buffer. MH-S cells and ARPE-19 cells were incubated with 1 mg/mL of either diphyllin nanoparticles (diphyllin NP) or bafilomycin nanoparticles (bafilomycin NP) loaded with a fluorescent DiD dye for 24 hours. fluorescence images validate nanoparticles uptake by the cells. CC50 and IC50 of free and nanoparticulate V-ATPase inhibitors. free bafilomycin or bafilomycin nanoparticles (bafilomycin NP) were added to MH-S cells. cell viability was normalized to the value of untreated medium controls. IC50 of free drug and drug-loaded nanoparticles was determined by the CPE inhibition assay in MH-S cells. the results showed that the IC50 of free diphyllin was 8.149 M, whereas that of the diphyllin nanoparticles was 4.640 M. the antiviral activity of free bafilomycin and bafilomycin nanoparticles against influenza virus H1N1 was also compared in MH-S cells. MH-S cells were pretreated with free diphyllin or diphyllin nanoparticles. the group treated with 5 and 10 M diphyllin nanoparticles had a significant decrease in viral TCID50 titer compared with the untreated and the free diphyllin-treated groups. MH-S cells were pretreated with bafilomycin nanoparticles in various concentrations and then infected with influenza virus H1N1. after 24 hours of incubation, the supernatant was harvested to determine the viral titer by TCID50. the nanoparticle delivery strategy can be applied to different types of V-ATPase inhibitors for antiviral applications in vivo. mice were inoculated intranasally with a nonlethal dose of H1N1 virus and intravenously treated with diphyllin nanoparticles equivalent to 10 g of diphyllin or empty nanoparticles of equivalent polymer content daily for 3 days. the mouse model of influenza infection was used. mice were inoculated intranasally with 100,000 PFU (0.5 LD50) of H1N1. intravenously treated with nanoparticles loaded with 10 g of diphyllin nanoparticles. diphyllin-loaded nanoparticles showed a Z-average diameter of 178 nm. the resulting diphyllin nanoparticles showed a uniformly spherical shape as visualized by TEM. the quantification of diphyllin loading in PEG-PLGA nanoparticles was determined by HPLC. the bafilomycin-loaded nanoparticles used in this study had a Z-average diameter of 197 nm. the resulting bafilomcycin-loaded nanoparticles showed a uniformly spherical shape as visualized by TEM. the standard curve was constructed with serially diluted samples of bafilomycin. 22% of diphyllin was released in the acidic buffer and 15% of diphyllin was released in the phosphate buffer. overall, diphyllin release from the nanoparticles was largely similar between the two pH values during the observation period. MH-S cells and ARPE-19 cells were incubated with 1 mg/mL of either diphyllin nanoparticles (diphyllin NP) or bafilomycin nanoparticles (bafilomycin NP) loaded with a fluorescent DiD dye for 24 hours. fluorescence signal was examined at 400 magnification under a fluorescence microscope. CC50 values of free bafilomycin and bafilomycin nanoparticles were 15.54 nM and 69.6 nM respectively. improved safety achieved by nanoparticulate diphyllin and bafilomycin. free bafilomycin or bafilomycin nanoparticles were added to MH-S cells. cell viability was normalized to the value of uninfected cell controls (100%) data in the plot represent mean SEM out of four test replicates. IC50 of free diphyllin was 8.149 M, whereas that of diphyllin nanoparticles was 4.640 M. of TI yielded values of 6.82 and 34.02 for the free bafilomycin and bafilomycin nanoparticles, respectively. the nanoparticulate V-ATPase inhibitors exhibited lower cytotoxicity and greater antiviral activity, improving the therapeutic index of diphyllin and bafilomycin. MH-S cells were pretreated with bafilomycin nanoparticles and were infected with H1N1 at an MOI of 1. after 24 hours of incubation, the supernatants were harvested to assess the viral TCID50 titers. the supernatant was harvested to determine the viral titer by TCID50. the viral titer in the group treated with 6.25 nM bafilomycin was 102.29 TCID50/50 L and the group treated with 3.125 nM bafilomycin was 102.61 TCID50/50 L. these groups significantly reduced viral titer compared with the medium control group (103.24 TCID50/50 L) mice receiving single treatment of diphyllin nanoparticles showed reduced weight loss. all the empty nanoparticle-receiving mice succumbed to virus infection within 6 days postinfection. these in vivo data collectively suggest that the diphyllin nanoparticles are able to reduce disease severity and enhance the survival outcome. the body weight of the mice was monitored in both groups. the survival rate of the mice was evaluated in both groups. anti-influenza studies begin to focus on host-targeted therapies. nanocarriers can then facilitate delivery of diphyllin and bafilomycin in the absence of organic solvents. Upon nanoparticle encapsulation, the water solubility of the drugs is improved and the cytotoxicity reduced. diphyllin and bafilomycin showed a sustained release profile. disease.35 MH-S cells retain many of the properties of AMs36. two nanoparticulate V-ATPase inhibitors exhibited potent anti-influenza activity in AMs in vitro. the effectiveness in other respiratory epithelial cells such as A549, Calu-3, RPMI 2650 are of interest for future investigation. this study demonstrates the therapeutic promise of nanoparticulate V-ATPase inhibitors in a mouse model of influenza virus infection. the use of diphyllin nanoparticle reduced the severity of influenza and improved the survival outcome in a mouse model of infection. for future studies, drug dosing and administration route can be further optimized. diphyllin-loaded nanoparticles and bafilomycin-loaded nanoparticles achieved a sustained release beyond 72 hours. the nanoparticles were efficiently taken up by multiple types of cell lines. in cell-based assays, nanoformulated diphyllin or bafilomycin revealed enhanced viral inhibitory activities than free drugs."}
