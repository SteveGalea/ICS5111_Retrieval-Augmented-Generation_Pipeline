{"summary": "hSCARB2 and PSGL-1 (CD162) are cellular receptors for EV71. it is ubiquitously expressed in several cell types, including the liver, spleen, testes, retinal pigment epithelium cells, macrophages, osteoblasts, and brain (10\u201312) it does not serve as a receptor for EV71 infection (13) leukocytes, dendritic cells, tissue macrophages and progenitor myeloid cells play a role in the binding of leukocytes to endothelial cells and platelets. the expression of human PSGL-1 in normally unsusceptible cell lines can also facilitate EV71 infection, leading to the development of cytopathic effects (9, 16) previous research has identified several types of endocytosis involved in virus entry following the binding to a receptor. clathrin-dependent endocytosis is required for EV71 infection in a mouse NIH 3T3 line constitutively expressing human SCARB2 cells (24). similar report confirmed the activation of clathrin-dependent endocytosis after EV71 infection of RD cells expressing SCARB2 but not PSGL-1 (9, 25). pEF-human PSGL-1 is an expression vector of pEF6-Flag-3S. transfected mouse L929 cells are human PSGL-1 expressing EV71-susceptible stable cell clones. pEF-bsd is empty vector of pEF6-Flag-3S. titer of virus stocks was tested by using a standard plaque-forming assay. cells (2 105/well) were seeded in 12-well plates 1 day prior to exposure to serial concentrations of inhibitors (all from Sigma-Aldrich) gene-specific siRNA duplexes were diluted to 25 pmol (for RD cells) or 50 pmol (for PSGL-1-L929 cells) in a 200 l of Opti-MEM I medium (Invitrogen) and then gently mixed with 1.82 l or 3.7 l of Lipofectamine RNAi-MAX (Lipo) reagents. the siRNA-Lipo mixtures were added to 800 l of subjected to quantitative PCR analysis (The LightCycler 480 real-time PCR system) using respective primer pairs. human/mouse -actin gene expression was also detected as the internal control. whole-cell protein lysates were prepared by lysing cells in a radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer adding a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) lysates were centrifuged for 30 min at 14,000 rpm at 4\u00b0C to sediment cell debris. ofluorescence assays were conducted on cells, and growth on coverslips after EV71 incubation occurred as described previously. cells were fixed with cold methanol and then incubated with a mixture of primary antibodies, i.e., anti-EV71 antibody (1:1,000) accompanied by anti-CAV-1 (1:500) cells were stained with FITC-conjugated avidin or Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse antibody. after three washes in 1 PBS, the stained cells were resuspended in 1 PBS. signals were detected using a flow cytometer and analyzed using FCS Express. pEF-human PSGL-1, an expression vector of pEF6-Flag-3S. transfected mouse L929 cells are human PSGL-1 expressing EV71-susceptible stable cell clones. pEF-bsd, a empty vector of pEF6-Flag-3S, was generously provided by Yorihiro Nishimura, Department of Virology II. titer of virus stocks was tested by using a standard plaque-forming assay. cells (2 105/well) were seeded in 12-well plates 1 day prior to exposure to serial concentrations of inhibitors. the cells were infected with EV71 for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. siRNA duplexes were diluted to 25 pmol (for RD cells) or 50 pmol (for PSGL-1-L929 cells) in a 200 l of Opti-MEM I medium (Invitrogen) and then gently mixed with 1.82 l or 3.7 l of Lipofectamine RNAi-MAX (Lipo) reagents. the siRNA-Lipo mixtures were added to 800 l of the appropriate numbers cDNA was subjected to quantitative PCR analysis (The LightCycler 480 real-time PCR system) using respective primer pairs (Genomics BioSci&Tech, Taiwan) the number of cycles required for the amplification of the target gene was obtained. whole-cell protein lysates were prepared by lysing cells in a radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer adding a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) lysates were centrifuged for 30 min at 14,000 rpm at 4\u00b0C. immunofluorescence assays were conducted on cells, and growth on coverslips after EV71 incubation occurred as described previously. cells were fixed with cold methanol and then incubated with a mixture of primary antibodies, i.e., anti-EV71 antibody (1:1,000) accompanied by anti-CAV-1 (1:500) cells were stained with FITC-conjugated avidin or Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse antibody. after three washes in 1 PBS, the stained cells were resuspended in 1 PBS. signals were detected using a FACScan flow cytometer. individually inoculated PSGL-1-L929 cells and empty vector-transducing bsd cells with EV71 at various MOIs. compared the expression of capsid proteins or viral RNA in both EV71-infected bsd and RD cells. increased levels of capsid proteins or viral RNA expression were relative to increases in the MOI of EV71. we infected bsd, PSGL-1-L929, and RD cells with EV71 at an MOI of 1. RD cells elicit more susceptibility to EV71 infection than hSCARB2. hSCARB2 supports RD cells to be infected by EV71. the total RNA from the infected cells (MOI = 1) at each time point (upper panel) or from the infected cells (serial MOI) at 3 h postinfection (bottom panel) were isolated to detect the viral RNA using real-time RT-PCR. the mean relative viral RNA compared to expression of the -actin internal control was calculated as described in Materials and Methods. CPZ is a cationic amphiphilic reagent that inhibits the assembly of the clathrin adaptor protein AP2. it is an indicator of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in EV71-infected cells. CPZ pretreatment effectively disrupted clathrin-dependent endocytosis in RD and PSGL-1-L929 cells. the EV71-infected cells (MOI = 1) were subjected to 2-h drug treatment at 4\u00b0C for 30 min. the drug's cytotoxicity was evaluated using an LDH assay. clathrin light-chain B (CLTB)-specific siRNA was significantly inhibited at 24 h. expression of viral RNA at 3 h postinfection was reduced significantly compared to control siRNA-treated RD cells. in contrast, PSGL-1-L929 cells revealed no differences in viral RNA expression while transfected with CLTB siRNA. clathrin-dependent endocytosis occurred in RD cells. total RNA (C) and lysates (D) were extracted and subjected to real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting with MAb979 antibody. the mean relative expression of RNA and protein levels of clathrin and EV71 were calculated as described previously. 29 and RD cells were treated with various concentrations of MCD in a serum-free medium at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. after EV71 (MOI = 1) infection, the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 3 h and lysed prior to RNA isolation. the level of viral RNA in each group was detected using real-time RT-PCR. RD and PSGL-1-L929 cells compared to vehicle-pretreated cells. we measured the viral RNA and capsid proteins using immunohistochemistry. pretreatment of PSGL-1-L929 cells with an effective dose of 20 g of genistein (Fig. 5B)/ml or 0.75 g of filipin (Fig. 5D)/ml showed significant inhibition. methanol, cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue) and fluorescence was detected using a confocal microscope. cytotoxicity of the inhibitors was evaluated using an LDH assay. at 3 h after EV71 infection, the total RNA was isolated from the drug-treated cells and subjected to real-time RT-PCR. 929 cells compared to control siRNA transfectants showed no differences in viral RNA and capsid proteins expression. these results suggest that the PSGL-1-mediated pathway for EV71 infection is caveola dependent. cells were transfected with mouse (for PSGL-1-L929 cells)- and human CAV-1 (for RD cells)-specific siRNA or control siRNA. the colocalizations were quantified, and the score of Pearson coefficient of correlation was calculated. more colocalizations in PSGL-1-L929 cells versus RD cells were observed. caveola-dependent endocytosis is essential for PSGL-1-mediated EV71 early infection. kinetic infection, Jurkat T cells was susceptible for EV71 infection (MOI = 0.05) was judged by the detection of viral RNA expression as early as at 6 h and significant increase at 24 h postinfection. pretreatment of Jurkat T cells with either CLTB or CAV-1 siRNA all downregulated the respective mRNA (Fig. 8C) and protein expression after 48 h transfection. cells were transfected with 100 pmol of human CLTB-, CAV-1-specific siRNA or control siRNA and then cultured at 37\u00b0C for 48 h. total RNAs were isolated to assay clathrin or caveolin-1 mRNA by real-time RT-PCR using the respective primers (C) and protein expression by immunoblotting with anti-clathrin or anti-caveolin-1 antibody (D) pretreatment of RD and PSGL-1 cells with various doses of NH4Cl, chloroquine, and bafilomycin A1 inhibited EV71 infection in a dose-dependent manner. no cytotoxicity of NH4Cl, chloroquine, and bafilomycin A1 treatments in both infected cells was noted. human PSGL-1 expression facilitates EV71 infection in unsusceptible mouse bsd cells. we individually inoculated PSGL-1-L929 cells and empty vector-transducing bsd cells with EV71 at various MOIs. compared them to the same infection in EV7-susceptible RD cells. RD and PSGL-1-L929 but not bsd cells showed a dose-dependent increase (MOI = 1 and up) at 3 h postinfection. EV71 grew efficiently in PSGL-1-L929 cells, in which the virus titer was peaked on day 3 after infection. RD cells elicit more susceptibility to EV71 infection than PSGL-1-L929 cells. bsd, PSGL-1-L929, and RD cells were infected with EV71 (serial MOI). the total RNA from the infected cells (MOI = 1) at each time point (upper panel) or from the infected cells (serial MOI) at 3 h postinfection (bottom panel) was isolated to detect the viral RNA using real-time RT-PCR. CPZ, a cationic amphiphilic reagent, inhibits the assembly of the clathrin adaptor protein AP2, is an inhibitor of clathrin-dependent endocytosis (26). CPZ pretreatment effectively disrupted clathrin-dependent endocytosis in the RD and PSGL-1-L929 cells. inhibitors specific to clathrin-dependent endocytosis abrogate EV71 infection in RD but not in PSGL-1-L929 cells. the cells cultured on coverslips were treated with 30 M CPZ and 75 MCD in a serum-free DMEM at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. the significant inhibition of clathrin protein was also observed in RD cells at 24 or 48 h after siRNA transfection. the expression of viral RNA at 3 h postinfection was reduced significantly compared to control siRNA-treated RD cells. in contrast, PSGL-1-L929 cells revealed no differences in viral RNA (Fig. 3C) or capsid proteins (Fig. 3D) expression while transfected with CLTB siRNA. cells were infected with EV71 (MOI = 1) and incubated at 4\u00b0C for 30 min. total RNA (C) and lysates (D) were extracted and subjected to real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting with MAb979 antibody. cellular -actin internal control was detected by blotting the same membrane with monoclonal anti-actin antibody. treatment with MCD disrupts EV71 infection. the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 3 h and lysed prior to RNA isolation. the level of viral RNA in each group was detected using real-time RT-PCR. pretreatment of PSGL-1-L929 cells with an effective dose of 20 g of genistein (Fig. 5B)/ml or 0.75 g of filipin (Fig. 5D)/ml showed significant inhibition in contrast to the no inhibition observed in RD cells even when pretreated with a maximum dose of genistein. cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue) after washing with PBS and fixing with cold methanol. cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue) and fluorescence was detected using a confocal microscope. the expression of EV71 RNA (Fig. 6C) and its capsid proteins (Fig. 6D) was markedly reduced in CAV-1 siRNA-treated PSGL-1-L929 cells compared to the control siRNA transfectants. the results suggest that the PSGL-1-mediated pathway for EV71 infection is caveola dependent. colocalizations of VP1 and EV71 (yellow) observed in cytosol and submembrane sites of EV71-infected PSGL-1-L929 cells but few in EV71-infected RD cells. more colocalizations in PSGL-1-L929 cells versus RD cells were observed. EV71 infection mediates a caveola-dependent but not clathrin-dependent pathway in human T cells. the pathway of EV71 infection in Jurkat T lymphocytes is caveola dependent and clathrin independent. cells were infected with EV71 (MOI = 0.05) and then cultured at 37\u00b0C for 48 h. total RNA was extracted at each time point postinfection. cells were transfected with 100 pmol of human siRNA or control siRNA. lysosomotropic agents have weak bases and can inhibit endosomal acidification by increasing intracellular pH (34\u201336) bafilomycin A1 acts by inhibiting vacuolar H+ ATPase (V-ATPase) that prevents maturation of autophagic vacuoles by inhibiting fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes. cytotoxicity of inhibitors was evaluated using real-time RT-PCR. the mean relative viral RNA compared to untreated cells was calculated. the data were obtained from three independent experiments. ligand for P-, L-, or E-selectin in platelets, leukocytes, or endothelium cells. it plays a role in leukocyte and inflammatory cell infiltration in inflammatory tissues. a monoclonal antibody (KLP1) can neutralize the binding between EV71 and PSGL-1 by blocking the recognition sites for P- and L-selectin (9) the role of PSGL-1 in EV71 infection has yet to be fully elucidated. the mechanism of EV71 entry is receptor dependent, in which human PSGL-1 initiates caveola-dependent endocytosis. these findings might facilitate the development of anti-EV71 medications."}
