{"summary": "VIGOR (Viral Genome ORF Reader) is a web application tool for gene prediction in influenza virus, rotavirus, rhinovirus and coronavirus subtypes. it detects protein coding regions based on sequence similarity searches and can predict mature peptides within a single polypeptide open reading frame. improvements in sequencing technology have made it easier and more common for the re-sequencing of large genomes as well as parallel sequencing of small genomes. this has led to an exponential increase in the genomic data available in public databases. but accurate gene prediction is a challenge that has created a bottleneck in the gene predication pipeline. similarity-based methods predict some false positive exons and genes in intergenic regions and introns. similarity-based tools cannot detect genes if the homologous sequences are not included in the reference data. VIGOR uses similarity-based approach to detect open reading frames (ORF) in viral genomes by similarity searches against custom reference protein sequence databases. VIGOR can predict genes accurately in influenza (group A, B, and C), coronavirus (including SARS coronavirus), rhinovirus, and rotavirus. the closest stop codon to the last aligned residue is selected. the closest stop codon to the last aligned residue is selected. selection of splice sites in influenza genomes and detection of ribosomal slippage sites are selected. VIGOR examines the region upstream of the orf1a stop codon to map out precisely the \"UUUAAAC\" string. it shifts back the reading frame by -1 nucleotide (from AAC to AAA) within the slippery sequence. only one subtype for HA and one subtype for neuraminidase (NA) the orf1a and orf1ab of SARS coronavirus derived from sequence comparative alignment and literature [11-13] are determined by mature peptide length and conserved cleavage signature sequences. the sequence region homologous to reference sequences will be identified as a non-functional gene region, and will be marked as a possible sequence mutation. ASTA format can be pasted or uploaded from a local file into the input sequence area through a GUI interface. the submission component transforms the submitted data into a job and the queuing component schedules the job for processing. the entire backend service was implemented in Perl. coronavirus and SARS coronavirus were included in the coronavirus and SARS coronavirus reference database. the longest aligned region detected by the similarity search is selected as the potential coding region. the protein sequence with highest identity in the similarity search is established as the reference sequence for the identification of start and stop codons. [5] are scanned around the alignment joint sites between the gap and aligned regions. identity to reference sequence and sequence length of the translated protein are selected. if these two do not agree with each other, sequence length has priority in choosing the final splice sites. the rhinovirus polyprotein is cleaved into 11 mature, functional peptides. there are conserved cleavage signature sequences for 9 cleavage sites. the polyprotein sequence is aligned with the sequences in VIGOR's custom rhinovirus mature peptide database. if the encoded protein is 500 amino acids or longer, the translated product must span more than 98% of the length of the reference protein. the encoded NS, MP, NP and NA proteins should not be 15 amino acid shorter than reference proteins. the sequence region homologous to reference sequences will be identified as a non-functional gene region. the main output file is the cDNA sequence file and a file of the alignment between the predicted protein and the best match in the custom database. if mutations which generate internal stop codons or frameshifts are detected, the mutated sequences plus the flanking sequences will be presented in the output. the results were evaluated by comparison between the gene finder predictions and annotations in GenBank. any prediction that was not identical to the GenBank annotation was inspected manually by similarity searching against the NCBI non-redundant protein database. a partially correct prediction was assigned when the prediction overlapped with the GenBank annotation in the same reading frame but with a different start codon. no. of genes No. of correct pred.
