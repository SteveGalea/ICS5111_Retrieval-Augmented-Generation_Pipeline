{"summary": "infectious diseases are among the most urgent public health threats and economic challenges facing global communities in the new millennium. recent examples include the emergence and rapid spread of Ebola virus disease in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone;1 Middle East respiratory syndrome in Saudia Arabia;3 avian influenza in Vietnam;4 polio in Pakistan;5 and the currently burgeoning epidemic of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection with associated microcephaly and other congenital neurological abnormalities in Brazil more than 2,400 km in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, the Hawaiian Archipelago lies 4,000 km from the US Mainland and nearly 8,000 km from mainland Asia. the university of Hawai\u2018i at Manoa is strategically positioned as a sentinel post to monitor the emergence and spread of newly recognized and re-emerging infectious diseases. the Pacific Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases Research has had a profound impact on creating the conditions that accelerate the pace of scientific discovery. the once-respected tropical medicine program at the University of Hawai\u2018i at Manoa had lost much of its previous stature. the centralization of the COBRE Center brought faculty into physical proximity with other research faculty within selected high-priority research areas. the investments in the Pacific Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases over the past 10 years have been leveraged into additional extramural grant support totaling more than $35 million. dra P.

Molecular and Cellular Immunology Core Equipped with specialized instrumentation, including FACSAria, FACSCalibur, Attune NxT and Guava flow cytometers, ELISPOT reader and Luminex\u00ae technology. the Molecular and Cellular Immunology Core provides hitherto unavailable capability and capacity to the research community within the University of Hawai\u2018i system. the COBRE Bioinformatics Core will become fully supported within the next five years. the biocontainment core manages the ABSL-3/BSL-3 facility in the BioSciences Building in Kaka\u2018ako. core personnel develop pathogen-specific standard operating procedures and perform project-specific assays. infectious disease research excellence and clinical expertise in Hawai\u2018i and the Asia-Pacific region will be feasible to develop and deploy broad suite of microbial antigens for point-of-care rapid diagnostics, broad-spectrum anti-pathogen countermeasures and effective treatments. off-the-shelf vaccine constructs to be better prepared to respond to the next infectious disease outbreak."}
