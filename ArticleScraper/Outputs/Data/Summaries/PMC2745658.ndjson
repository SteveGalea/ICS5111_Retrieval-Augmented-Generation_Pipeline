RT-PCR has superseded the use of monoclonal antibodies for typing and characterising new strains of rabies virus. this approach has superseded the use of monoclonal antibodies for typing and characterising new strains of rabies virus. positive PCR results should be sequenced to confirm the origin of the virus. contamination of negative samples could lead to an unjustifiable administration of a high number of costly post exposure prophylaxis. lack of standardization is a major obstacle to the general use of PCR for rabies diagnosis, especially in developing countries. this technique has also been adapted to investigate rabies virus replication in-situ. existing assays for rabies virus prevalence studies either require high containment facilities or do not distinguish between neutralising and non-neutralising antibodies. a further benefit of this technique is its adaption to using small volumes of sera thus making them useful for surveillance. interest in treating human rabies aggressively is gaining momentum. interest in treating human rabies aggressively is gaining momentum. interest in treating human rabies aggressively is gaining momentum. the bioassays produce very rapid results (5\u201315 minutes), are highly reproducible (%CV5%) and are ultra-sensitive (50 fM) this sort of biosensor offers the rapidity of production of signal of a lateral flow device with the sensitivity of third generation ELISAs. pseudotypes expressing genotype 1 CVS-11 glycoprotein were produced that proved 100% specific and highly sensitive compared with neutralisation titres achieved using the FAVN [50] a high correlation was also observed (r = 0.89) a vaccine study in Tanzania compared the two assays with pseudotypes showing 100% specificity and 94.4% sensitivity to the FAVN. the development of PCR-based methods (Box 2) provided an alternative method for post mortem rabies diagnosis [26], and the possibility of ante mortem diagnosis of human rabies [52]. RT-PCR methods invariably involve multiple transfers of nucleic acids between different tubes. any small amount of contamination will undoubtedly produce false-positive results. PCR based techniques are not currently recommended by the WHO for routine post-mortem diagnosis of rabies. however, these molecular techniques have been successfully applied for confirmatory diagnosis and epidemiological surveys. international bodies will accept their use in the future for routine rabies diagnosis. the lack of standardization is a major obstacle to the general use of PCR for rabies diagnosis, especially in developing countries. a NASBA technique was successfully applied to the saliva and CSF of four living patients with rabies and detected rabies viral RNA 2-days after the onset of symptoms. this technique has been adapted to investigate rabies virus replication in-situ. there is a clear need to simplify molecular diagnostic techniques so these tests can be applied universally in developing and developed countries. more use will be made of point-of-care (POC) diagnostic testing using portable extraction techniques linked to PCR machines with the use of lyophilised reagents. ies immunotherapy is not appropriate i.e. immunosuppressed patients, resulting in substantial drug cost savings."}
