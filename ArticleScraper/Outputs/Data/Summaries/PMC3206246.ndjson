{"summary": "the Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma guideline classifies rhinitis into allergic rhinitis (AR) and non-allergic rhinitis (NAR) based on the presence and absence of allergic sensitization. rhinitis has been trivialized by clinicians as it does not cause fatalities, and has been understudied. rhinitis symptoms were already observable from preschool age. others studies had also shown that rhinitis symptoms are already prevalent in the first 6 years of life. this review aims to discuss gaps in knowledge regarding AR in early childhood. rhinitis is a disease of the nasal lining presenting with symptoms of nasal itch, sneezing, runny and/or blocked nose. the classification of rhinitis differs slightly between guidelines. rhinitis is classified as a separate category from NAR. clinical symptoms of discharge (mucopurulent), nasal obstruction, headache and facial pain, and ear pain and pressure are common symptoms of sinusitis [12]. diagnostic confirmation requires endoscopic examination and CT scan of the sinuses. most of these studies were not accompanied by allergy testing, hence the diagnosis of AR is tentative. studies show that the prevalence of rhinitis in preschoolers is substantial. these rates are comparable with that reported in the phase III of the ISAAC. birth cohort studies provide us with the opportunity to understand the onset and development of rhinitis. a study by marinho et al. [26] also showed a dose-response relationship between sensitization by means of specific IgE and skin prick test results in the risk of rhinoconjunctivitis. parental, especially maternal, history of allergic symptoms is also a consistently reported risk of AR [21, 23, 27, 28]. Various environmental factors were found to increase the risk of rhinitis in children 6 years old. a study was done to assess the correlation between maternal vitamin D intake during pregnancy and AR outcome at 5 years old. the role of viral infections Respiratory virus infections have been suggested to play a significant role in the inception and exacerbation of asthma [36]. respiratory viruses are commonly detected in infants and young children with rhinorrhoea [38, 39]. adenoidal hypertrophy may mimic the symptoms of AR and therefore should always be considered in young children with rhinitis. recent onset otitis media with effusion in children [44] or occurring in the first 2 years of life [45] is associated with rhinitis at 6 years of age. a quarter of children prescribed topical nasal medications refused to comply with therapy. intranasal corticosteroids were the most effective for relief of AR. non pharmacological therapy with saline nasal rinses has also shown modest improvement in rhinitis symptoms in those above the age of 6 years. the search terms 'rhinitis' and'management guidelines' were included. study analyzed rhinitis separately from other disease conditions. study analyzes subjects aged 6 and below separately from subjects aged >6. non-allergic rhinitis with eosinophilic syndrome, occupational, drug-induced and hormonal removed from model due to rarity or inapplicability in childhood. clinical symptoms of discharge (mucopurulent), nasal obstruction, headache and facial pain, and ear pain and pressure are common symptoms of sinusitis. the prevalence of rhinitis symptoms in preschool age groups ranged from 2.8% to 42.7% (Table 1). this wide variation in rhinitis prevalence is very similar to data in school aged children. rhinitis rates reported at 25.5% for Singapore schoolchildren 6-7 years old [17] cross sectional population studies on rhinitis in early childhood have used validated rhinitis questions from international study of allergy and asthma in Childhood (ISAAC) some assessed the presence of symptoms indicating AR (sneezing, runny or blocked nose outside of cold or flu) birth cohort studies on rhinitis in early childhood. the prevalence of AR continues to increase into adolescence. NAR peaks in the preschool age group and then lags behind AR thereafter. ETS exposure was reported to increase the risk of rhinitis [19, 20], but this increased risk was not consistently found [18, 29]. traffic related pollutions were suggested to be an adjuvant for allergen sensitization [30], which may explain its association with increased risk of rhinitis. respiratory viruses have been shown to cause inflammatory changes in the upper airway as has been seen in the lower airway. rhinitis has significant co-morbidities besides its direct effect on the quality of life, rhinitis has significant co-morbidities. management of rhinitis may require multidisciplinary approach involving the paediatrician or paediatric allergist and the otolaryngologist. a significant unmet need lies in the pharmacological armamentarum approved for use in children less than 2 years of age. first generation antihistamines are not recommended due to its sedative effect. non pharmacological therapy with saline nasal rinses has shown modest improvement in rhinitis symptoms in those above the age of 6 years. allergen immunotherapy is another therapeutic strategy that is attractive in that it reduces new sensitizations, reduces the risk of asthma."}
