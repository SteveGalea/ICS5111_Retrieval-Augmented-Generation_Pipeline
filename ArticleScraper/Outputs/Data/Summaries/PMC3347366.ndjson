{"summary": "Virus isolates are classified into distinct groups based on the serological response to the inner capsid protein VP6. RVA strains cause the vast majority of RV-associated morbidity and mortality in humans. RVB and RVC also can cause severe gastroenteritis in children and adults. RVB (in infected rats) and RVC (in infected ST-1 cells) undergo final morphogenesis by budding through endoplasmic reticulum membranes to assemble mature infectious particles. the C-terminal tail of RVA NSP4 facilitates this budding-and-assembly process by acting as an intracellular receptor in ER membranes. viroporin-mediated increases in [Ca2+]cyto induce formation of NSP4 vesicular structures (puncta), which have been shown to colocalize with the autophagy marker microtubule-associated protein light chain 3. bacterial expression constructs were generated using the pET46 Ek/LIC vector. NSP4s from RVA strains have been classified into 14 enterotoxin (E) genotypes (39), according to a new nomenclature system. gene from RRV (RVA genotype E3; accession number AAA64924) and Cowden (RVC; accession number AF093202, originally from Linda Saif) were amplified from virus stock using a superscript one-step reverse transcription-PCR kit. bacterial expression constructs were used to transform BL21(DE3) and BL21(DE3)pLysS E. coli (Promega, WI) which express the T7 RNA polymerase under the control of the LacI operator. in all cases, transformants carrying a NSP4 expression vector were grown in LB medium supplemented with 1% (vol/vol) glucose and appropriate antibiotics for selection. cells and membrane fragments were pelleted by centrifugation (22,000 g, 30 min) and solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, and 0.5% N-laurylsarcosine) the beads were washed and eluted in lysis buffer containing 40 mM and 500 mM imidazole. dilutions of BL21(DE3) E. coli were serially diluted 10-fold. 100 l of each dilution was plated on agar medium (LB, 1% glucose, ampicillin) the plates were then incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C. gates were set using unstained cells and cells stained with RSG or PI alone. the assay was performed in triplicate, and the results are presented as the mean fluorescence intensity. trypsin diluent (137 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 423 M Na2HPO4, 441 M KH2PO4, 5.6 mM dextrose, 4.5 mM NaHCO3) was added to neutralize the trypsin. cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 71 g for 5 min, the supernatant was removed, and then loading buffer was added. in PBS for 30 min and blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 30 min. cells were washed three times with PBS, and quinolinium 4-[3-(3-methyl-2(3H)-benzothiazolylidene)-1-propenyl]diiodide was added for nucleus staining. images were processed using LSM 510 Image v3.2 SP2 (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY) and saved as 12-bit tagged TIFF images in RGB-format MDB files. all observations were carried out in the Integrated Microscopy Core Laboratory, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX. the pET46 expression vector encodes an N-terminal hexahistidine tag for affinity chromatography purification. each NSP4 gene was amplified with appropriate primers that incorporated a 5\u2032 EcoRI and 3\u2032 AgeI restriction enzyme site. each NSP4 gene was amplified with appropriate primers that incorporated a 5\u2032 EcoRI and 3\u2032 AgeI restriction enzyme site. the attenuated cowden virus stock was a kind gift from Frank Ramig at Baylor College of Medicine. the bacterial expression constructs were used to transform BL21(DE3) and BL21(DE3)pLysS E. coli (Promega, Madison, WI) cells were diluted 1:100 into fresh medium (LB, 1% glucose, 100 g/ml ampicillin, 35 g/ml chloramphenicol) and then plated into a 96-well culture plate. the plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C until the cultures reached mid-log phase. nitrocellulose membranes were washed three times in 0.5% BLOTTO. membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline. membranes were then incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C. green is a novel redox indicator that becomes fluorescent green upon being modified by bacterial reductases. disruption of the bacterial inner membrane would neutralize the proton gradient similarly to proton ionophores, which increase RSG fluorescence (21). the cells were washed with trypsin diluent (137 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 423 M Na2HPO4, 441 M KH2PO4, 5.6 mM dextrose, 4.5 mM NaHCO3) at 16 h posttransfection, the cells were washed with trypsin diluent (137 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 423 Fluo-2 fluorescence was excited by the argon laser (488 nm) and emission was detected with a 610/20 band pass filter. gates were set using unstained cells, cells expressing TagRFP alone, and cells loaded with Fluo-2-AM alone. cells were grown on glass coverslips (12-mm circular, no. 1.5; Fisherbrand) EGFP imaging cells were excited using a 488-nm laser line. fluorescence emission spectra were collected between 500 and 530 nm. z stack slices were set to 0.25 m. the supernatant containing soluble proteins (S) was collected. the membrane pellet (M) was solubilized in PBS plus 1% SDS. protein samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. RVA avian NSP4s diverged substantially from mammalian RVA NSP4s. the ungrouped RV strains clustered most closely with RVB strains. based on the ClustalW alignment, the RVA viroporin domain aligned with the C-terminal-most hydrophobic domains. lysine (K) and arginine (R) residues are in bold in the SA11 sequence. conservation of residues is based on SA11 for RVA, IDIR for RVB, and Cowden for RVC. 61\u2013105 106\u2013219 RVC 150 2 (19\u201333; 36\u201355) 33\u201369 70\u2013150 RVD 127 3 (9\u201319; 29\u201346) 42\u201385 71\u2013127 Ungrouped 213 3 (33\u201341; 51\u201372; 74\u201398) 66\u2013106 99\u2013213 a Summary of NSP4 domain organization of known serogroups. we used helical wheel diagrams to look at the orientation of the basic residues within the RVB and RVC putative viroporin domains. in RVB NSP4, the basic residues are linearly arranged rather than being aligned on one face of the -helix. in RVB NSP4, the basic residues are dispersed throughout the putative viroporin domain, though Arg35 and Lys38 are adjacent on the -helix. motifs were found in the C-terminal-most hydrophobic domain of non-RVA NSP4s. the polybasic motif was previously shown to be critical for RVA NSP4 viroporin activity. however, these dramatic differences raised the possibility that viroporin activity was not a feature of all NSP4s. truncation of the C terminus, RVA NSP4 aa 1 to 146, killed cells in the absence of cell lysis. we then tested forms of RVA with both N- and C-terminal truncations for E. coli lysis. a chimeric Ty-1/SA11 construct was also tested. it replaced the Ty-1 NSP4 pentalysine domain (aa 47 to 72) with the SA11 NSP4 sequence. the optical densities at 600 nm of uninduced (closed symbols) and NSP4-expressing (open symbols) cultures were measured. aa 20-146 truncation supported cell lysis in this assay. we found that OSU and RRV NSP4s both induced lysis similarly to SA11. this result was expected, given the high degree of sequence conservation between NSP4 genotypes E1, E2 and E3. NSP4s from mammalian RVA strains all have similar viroporin activity. avian RVA and RVB NSP4s did not support E. coli lysis. however, expression of NSP4 is cytotoxic to E. coli in a viroporin domain-dependent manner. cells expressing RVB NSP4 had significantly greater viability than cells expressing either RVA or RVC NSP4. expression of all of the NSP4s caused a significant decrease in cell viability. however, cells expressing the wild-type or chimeric Ty-1 NSP4 had significantly higher viability than cells expressing SA11 NSP4. lysis and cytotoxicity assays suggested that NSP4-mediated E. coli cytotoxicity may be due to disruption of ion gradients across the inner membrane. the redox state of cells is an informative measure of cell vitality and whether the proton gradient is intact. aliquots of each culture were stained with RSG and PI. expression of SA11 NSP4 aa 47 to 146, but not viroporin-deficient ASDASA mutant, increased RSG fluorescence. expression of the negative control RVA NSP4 aa 95 to 146, which lacks the viroporin domain, did not significantly alter RSG fluorescence. cells were stained with RSG for 10 min at 37\u00b0C. they were then analyzed by flow cytometry for the RSG mean fluorescence intensity. error bars represent standard deviations. no statistically significant difference in RSG staining between groups. bacterium-based viroporin assays show a more attenuated phenotype than RVA or RVC NSP4. however, both Ty-1 and RVB NSP4s had significant viroporin-like activity. the results of the bacterial assays support our prediction that viroporin activity is a common NSP4 function. RVA, RVB, and RVC NSP4s with TagRFP expressed these proteins in MA104 cells by transient transfection. reticular pattern consistent with ER localization and punctate structures. RVB NSP4 from SA11 and Ty-1 NSP4 formed discrete round puncta. RVA SA11 NSP4 forms serogroup-specific puncta that colocalize with EGFP-LC3. RVB NSP4 also showed prominent perinuclear localization (C, arrowhead) confocal microscopy performed 24 h posttransfection. coexpressed SA11 NSP4-EGFP and Ty-1 NSP4-RFP completely colocalized. most RVB and RVC NSP4-RFP did not colocalize with SA11 NSP4-EGFP. NSP4 colocalized with calnexin and sec61 ER markers in the reticular pools. the reticular pools of SA11 RVA (Fig. 7M), Ty-1 RVA (Fig. 7N), RVB (Fig. 7O) or RVC (Fig. 7P) localized to the Golgi. in were detected by indirect immunofluorescence. the punctate structures formed by SA11 NSP4 are induced by elevated [Ca2+]cyto and colocalize with the autophagy marker LC3, a soluble cytosolic protein that forms punctate structures upon induction of autophagy. both RVA SA11 and RVB IDIR NSP4 both elevate [Ca2+]cyto levels. there has been little molecular characterization of the intracellular functions of non-serogroup A rotavirus NSP4 in mammalian cells. the Fluo-2 MFIs of RFP-negative (gray) and RFP-positive (black) populations are graphed. Error bars represent standard deviations. SA11 NSP4-RFP-positive population had a higher Fluo-2 MFI than the negative-control TagRFP-positive population. NSP4s from RVA, RVB, and RVC all function to elevate [Ca2+]cyto, which is consistent with the observed viroporin activity in E. coli. however, the extent of NSP4-mediated [Ca2+]cyto elevation differed significantly between different serogroups, underlining possible functional differences. putative viroporin domains for mammalian (Ma) and avian (Av) RVA NSP4, RVB NSP4, and RVC NSP4 (aa 34 to 69) are shown with dashed lines with the identified polybasic (+) and amphipathic () domains indicated. lysine (K) or arginine (R) residues are represented by dashes, and gaps are represented by dots. Helical wheel diagrams of the RVA (SA11), RVB (IDIR), and RVC (Cowden) amphipathic -helices. s selected, there was more than 90% identity between SA11, OSU, and RRV, and the two critical viroporin motifs identified in SA11 NSP4 were fully conserved (29). despite the greater divergence, the EC viroporin motifs were essentially conserved, but a number of changes in the pentalysine domain were noted. in RVA NSP4, the basic residues are dispersed throughout the putative viroporin domain, though Arg35 and Lys38 are adjacent on the -helix. despite substantial divergence in the primary sequence, characteristic viroporin structural motifs were found in the C-terminal-most hydrophobic domain of non-RVA NSP4s. however, the organization of the basic residues, particularly the arrangement of basic residues, was not conserved. orin activity in representative RVA, RVB, and RVC NSP4s. previous studies showed that SA11 NSP4 causes viroporin-domain dependent lysis of BL21(DE3)pLysS cells. expression of full-length RVA NSP4 (aa 1 to 175) appeared to kill the cells in the absence of lysis. full-length NSP4 from RVA, RVB, and RVC rotaviruses tested for activity in an E. coli lysis assay. optical densities at 600 nm of uninduced (closed symbols) and NSP4-expressing (open symbols) cultures were measured. full-length RVA NSP4 (FL; black arrowhead) and the aa 20-146 truncated NSP4 (white arrowhead) were detected with NSP4 MAb B4-2/55. expression of full-length RVB NSP4 had no effect on the E. coli growth kinetics, did not induce cell lysis. expression of full-length RVB NSP4 caused rapid cell lysis. we hypothesized this was due to the disrupted helical orientation of conserved lysine and/or arginine residues in Ty-1 NSP4 between aa 55 and 69. to test this, we made a chimeric Ty-1 NSP4 in which we inserted the SA11 NSP4 pentalysine domain (PD; aa 47 to 72) in place of the Ty-1 sequence. the anti-His-tag antibody detected Ty-1 N expression of BL21(DE3)pLysS cells is mediated by T7 phage lysozyme. however, expression of NSP4 is cytotoxic to E. coli in a viroporin domain-dependent manner. in the absence of IPTG, all cultures had 108 to 109 CFU/ml. cells expressing the wild-type or chimeric Ty-1 NSP4 had significantly higher viability than cells expressing SA11 NSP4. the data suggest a weaker viroporin activity of these NSP4s in bacteria. the results of the lysis and cytotoxicity assays suggested that NSP4-mediated E. coli cytotoxicity may be due to disruption of ion gradients across the inner membrane. the proton gradient is directly linked to cellular oxidation and reduction activity, as many oxidases and reductases are inner membrane proton pumps (53). expression of SA11 NSP4 aa 47 to 146, but not the viroporin-deficient ASDASA mutant, increased RSG fluorescence. expression of the negative control RVA NSP4 aa 95 to 146, which lacks the viroporin domain, did not significantly alter RSG fluorescence (Fig. 5D) or increase PI staining (data not shown) mammalian RVA and avian RVA NSP4 significantly increased RSG fluorescence. both the full-length protein and the aa 20-146 truncation of mammalian RVA NSP4 significantly increased RSG fluorescence. however, full-length RVA stimulated a much greater increase in RSG signal than the truncation construct. the results of the bacterial assays support our prediction that viroporin activity is a common NSP4 function. the bacterial assays represent classical and rapid tests for viroporin-like activity of proteins. however, viroporin activity has to be shown by expression of the protein in a relevant mammalian cell. RVB NSP4 showed stronger perinuclear localization (arrowhead) and elongated puncta. RVC NSP4 showed a patchy distribution with large disc-like puncta. EGFP-tagged RVA SA11 NSP4 was transfected into MA104 cells with RFP-tagged Ty-1 RVA, RVB, or RVC NSP4. only a small subset of RVA and RVC puncta colocalize (L, arrowhead) studies have shown that mammalian RVA NSP4 localizes to the ER and the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) but does not transverse the Golgi apparatus (4). in RV-infected cells these structures appear to cap viroplasms (4). reticular and punctate pools of SA11 RVA (Fig. 7M), Ty-1 RVA (Fig. 7N), RVB (Fig. 7O) or RVC (Fig. 7P) localized to the Golgi. this is consistent with the carbohydrate moieties on RVA and RVC NSP4 remaining sensitive to Endo H (Fig. 6E, F, and H). EGFP-LC3 remained cytoplasmic and did not colocalize with NSP4. Ty-1 RVA NSP4s also induced LC3 puncta that colocalized with NSP4. RVB and RVC NSP4s strongly colocalized with EGFP-LC3 punctate structures. expression of the TagRFP protein alone was used as the negative control. the RFP-positive and -negative populations had similar distributions of Fluo-2 fluorescence. the SA11 NSP4-RFP-positive population had a higher Fluo-2 MFI than the negative-control TagRFP-positive population. similar increases were observed for the avian Ty-1 RVA NSP4. RVB and RVC NSP4 also increased intracellular Ca2+ level. divergent NSP4 genes from RV serogroups A, B, and C retained viroporin-like activity despite dramatic sequence divergence. the importance of high [Ca2+]cyto is well established for RVA RV, but this has not been shown for RVB or RVC strains. avian RVA, RVB, and RVC NSP4s tested using eukaryotic viral proteins. each of the tested NSP4s showed viroporin activity both in E. coli and in mammalian cells. however, there was considerable variability in the phenotype between assays and for different NSP4s. a chimera Ty-1/SA11-PD 20-146 Yes Yes ND NA NA RVB (rat) IDIR 1-218 (FL) No Yes + LC3 puncta Yes RVC (porcine) Cowden 1-150 (FL) No Yes + + LC3 puncta Yes RVC (porcine) Cowden 1-150 (FL) viroporin-like activity has been noted for several viroporins. hepatitis c virus p7 and picornavirus 2B (11, 54). a bacterial cytotoxicity assay and a redox assay tested for viroporin-like activity. the blunted phenotypes are interesting because Ty-1 and RVB NSP4 were expressed at higher levels than mammalian RVA and RVC NSP4. this suggests that viroporin-mediated cytotoxicity is the primary reason for the low expression level of full-length RVA NSP4 in E. coli. the punctate structures were colocalized with two ER markers (calnexin and Sec61) and RVA and RVC NSP4 were modified by the addition of N-linked glycans. the shape and distribution of the punctate structures associated with NSP4 was unique for each serogroup, underlining the presence of serogroup-specific characteristics. RVA and RVB NSP4 disrupted [Ca2+]cyto with different kinetics in Sf9 cells. differences in the rate of expression could affect the timing of peak Ca2+ levels. the detailed pathways involved for RVA NSP4 remain unknown. a possible contribution of NSP4 viroporin activity at the plasma membrane in RV-infected cells cannot be ruled out. despite significant sequence divergence, NSP4s from RVA, RVB, and RVC all have viroporin activity in both E. coli and mammalian cells."}
