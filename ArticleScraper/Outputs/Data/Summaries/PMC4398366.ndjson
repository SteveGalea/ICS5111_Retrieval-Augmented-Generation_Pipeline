{"summary": "in 2009, the WHO declared the first influenza pandemic, influenza A/H1N1, of the past 40 years [2]. by august of 2010, an estimated 18,449 deaths in 214 countries were due to this disease [3]. scientists are concerned that the number of viral outbreaks will increase in the future as worldwide populations become more dense and mobile. he described social capital as imbedded in social relationships and serving as resources for people to achieve their goals. he introduced various forms of social capital such as obligations, expectations, and trustworthiness that exist in social structures, and norms and effective sanctions against deviant behavior. the study examined whether these different forms of social capital are associated with a person\u2019s intention to adopt health-protective behaviors during an influenza pandemic. the study examined whether these different forms of social capital are associated with a person\u2019s intent to receive a vaccine, wear a face mask, and wash hands more frequently during an outbreak. study sought to measure participants\u2019 intention to perform three behavioral outcome variables during a possible influenza epidemic. participants responded to a version of the following question for each of the three behavioral intention variables: receiving a vaccine, wearing a mask, and washing their hands more frequently. the concept of trust in the government\u2019s capacity to handle an influenza pandemic was measured based on a 5-point scale. participants evaluated whether the government fully informs the public with information about new types of influenza, whether they worry that the government might hide information about a new type of influenza. these two variables were measured on a 5-point scale. the risk perception variables were suggested to be positively associated with health behavioral intention. based on the theory of the Health Belief Model. the sampling design randomly selected townships and districts, lis, and individuals by probability proportional to their size. the total sample size was 2,005, with a response rate of 53%. this study included 1,745 respondents, with no missing data for any of the study variables. the second variable measured the number of neighbors with whom the respondent was on greeting terms and was recategorized into the following number categories. the second variable measured the number of neighbors from whom the respondent could ask a favor when needed, such as receiving a mail delivery and taking care of or picking up children. study examined construct validity through an exploratory factor analysis on all social-capital variables. each variable fits well under presumed dimensions and there are significant relationships existing between the variables and the concepts. many variables were also found to have significant relationships with the theoretical concepts of previous studies. the scale was recategorized into two groups: 1 (very good, good, fair) and 0 (poor, very poor). Outcome variables The study sought to measure the participants\u2019 intention to perform three behavioral outcome variables during a possible influenza epidemic. a composite score was created by averaging these three variables. the concept of trust in the government\u2019s capacity to handle an influenza pandemic was measured according to participant responses to the following three questions, based on a 5-point scale. these two variables were measured on a 5-point scale. they were recategorized into two groups: high vs. low. the risk perception variables were suggested to be positively associated with health behavioral intention, based on the theory of the Health Belief Model. the respondents had a monthly household income of NT$90,000 (52.2%), were college graduates (48.4%), and lived in urban areas (49.4%); 38.7% rated themselves as having poor health. most of the respondents reported that they intended to receive vaccination (78.8%), wear a mask (91.6%), and wash their hands more frequently. 52.49 81.77* 90.17* 93.78 Female 47.51 75.51 93.24 95.05 Age 20\u201334 30.83 82.53 94.42* 91.82* 35\u201349 26.30 76.91 93.46 95.86 50\u201364 27.97 77.46 92.42 96.52 65 14.90 76.92 81.15 93.08 Monthly household income NT$50,000 24.76 71 95* High 88.60 80.53 92.63 94.83 Bonding social capital Neighborhood support a Low (2.1) 27.62 75.31* 90.46 91.70* Middle (2.1\u20133.4) 32.78 77.62 91.78 94.23 High (> 3.4) 39.60 82.20 92.33 96.38 Bridging social capital Association membership No 59.03 77.96 90.19* 93.98 Yes 40. bonding social capital measured according to neighborhood support (OR = 1.19) and linking social capital measured based on general government trust (OR = 1.35) were consistently associated with the behavioral intention to receive vaccination. variables OR (95% CI) a AOR (95% CI) b Sociodemographic factors risk perception Gender Female 1 1 Male 1.45 (1.16\u20131.83)** 1.41 (1.11\u20131.80)** Age 20\u201334 1 1 35\u201349 0.71 (0.52\u20130.96)* 0. 1.01) Perceived susceptibility Low 1 1 High 1.58 (1.13\u20132.20)** 1.44 (1.02\u20132.03)* Perceived severity Low 1 1 High 2.20 (1.60\u20133.02)** 2.29 (1.63\u20133.21)** Bonding social capital Neighborhood support 1.17 (1.05\u20131.31)** 1.19 (1.05\u20131.34)** Linking social capital General government trust 1.39 (1.21\u20131.60)** 1.35 (1.16\u20131.57)** Trust in Variables OR (95% CI) a AOR (95% CI) b Sociodemographic factors and risk perception Gender Female 1 1 Male 0.67 (0.47\u20130.94)* 0.53 (0.36\u20130.78)** Age 20\u201334 1 1 35\u201349 0.84 (0.50\u20131.42) 0.77 (0.43\u20131.40) 50\u201364 0.72 (0.44\u20131.18) 0.82 (0.43\u20131.60) 65 0.25 (0.16\u20130.41)** 0.38 (0.19 the results for the intention to wash one\u2019s hands more frequently during an influenza pandemic are shown in Table 4. the adjusted model indicates that respondents in suburban areas were less likely than those in urban areas to wash their hands frequently. 0.52\u20131.75) NT$90,000\u2013179,999 1.17 (0.63\u20132.14) 0.99 (0.51\u20131.94) NT$180,000 0.92 (0.52\u20131.62) 0.87 (0.48\u20131.58) Missing 2.72 (0.63\u201311.67) 2.66 (0.59\u201312.02) Education High school graduates 1 1 Some college 1.51 (0.86\u20132.65) 1.72 (0.88\u20133.37) College graduates 1.29 (0.80\u20132.08) 1.70 (0.88\u20133.2 bridging social capital in a neighborhood was associated with all types of behavioral intention. compared with the significant relationship between bridging social capital and the intention to wear a face mask, this study found that bonding social capital in a neighborhood was associated with all types of behavioral intention. the results of this study showed that people perceived low susceptibility to contracting the disease (17.8%) but a high severity of disease (88.6%) during a possible, future influenza pandemic [34]. this study found that perceived severity of the disease was associated with the intention to receive vaccination and wear a face mask but was not associated with the intention to wash hands more frequently. study relied on self-reporting respondents; therefore the findings may be subject to social desirability and recall bias [12] response rates for survey research have been declining in many countries for the past decades."}
