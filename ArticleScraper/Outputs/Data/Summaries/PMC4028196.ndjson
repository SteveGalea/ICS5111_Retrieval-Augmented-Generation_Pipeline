{"summary": "a novel PPP research program of moderate size would pose substantial risks to human life, even optimistically assuming a low probability that a pandemic would ensue from a laboratory accident. a rigorous, quantitative, impartial risk\u2013benefit assessment should precede further novel PPP experimentation. have genetically combined less pathogenic avian viruses, such as H9N2, with human seasonal influenza viruses to generate strains that exhibit enhanced transmissibility. we define PPPs as infectious agents with four characteristics: Having known or likely efficient transmission among humans Significantly virulent Unmitigated by preexisting population immunity Genetically distinct from pathogens currently circulating. the paradigm case is the creation of variants of influenza A/H5N1 that are readily transmissible between ferrets, heightened ferret transmission is thought to be a good model for human-to-human transmission. strains resulting from selection for heightened ferret transmission are likely to be similarly transmissible by humans via respiratory droplets. this particular gain of function presents unique risks and raises special ethical issues. we advocate a dispassionate review of pertinent evidence and calculations of the probabilities and magnitudes of potential risks parameterized for specific PPP research programs. we define PPPs as infectious agents with four characteristics: Having known or likely efficient transmission among humans Significantly virulent Unmitigated by preexisting population immunity Genetically distinct from pathogens currently circulating. ferret transmission is thought to be a good [59],[60] (albeit imperfect [61],[62]) model for human-to-human transmission. strains resulting from selection for heightened ferret transmission are likely to be similarly transmissible by humans via respiratory droplets. this particular gain of function presents unique risks and raises special ethical issues. ethical constructs and risk evaluations must be tailored to scientific advances in methodology and application. limited attention has been paid to the ethics of scientific experiments that pose risks beyond identified human participants [30]\u2013[32] the vaccine claim has been denied by vaccine developers. advocates argue that creating potentially pandemic strains of a particular virus, e.g., A/H5N1, could facilitate the production and stockpiling of vaccines against that variant. most of these sequences were over eight months old by the time they were publicly available in the Influenza Virus Resource [42]. it is highly unlikely that such limited surveillance could detect a pandemic viral sequence and, furthermore, spur effective mitigation actions. a surveillance signal alone would prompt swifter actions than these existing warning signs for H7N9 have. the phenotype of any mutation depends on interactions with its genetic background, a phenomenon known as epistasis. it is unlikely that a catalog of mutations could inform reliable predictions of transmission phenotype in circulating strains. safer approaches to studying influenza pathogenesis and transmission focus on dissecting these interactions. some approaches start with sequence analysis and molecular dynamics modeling, which are intrinsically safe. studies with intact viruses will be necessary for a full understanding of human transmission of influenza. in vitro studies of specific properties required for human adaptation using single proteins studies of H5 or H7 receptor binding to mammalian versus human sialic acids. studies of genetic determinants of optimal pH of fusion by comparing properties of natural isolates. the public health goal is to curtail influenza pandemics and seasonal transmission. it should be remembered that the public health goal is to curtail influenza pandemics and seasonal transmission. no risk\u2013benefit analysis has been made public, if it has been conducted. funding and regulatory agencies have not yet called for a risk\u2013benefit analysis."}
