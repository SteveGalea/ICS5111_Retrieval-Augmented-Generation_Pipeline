{"summary": "the 20th century has seen its share of improvement in the health of Canadians. life expectancy has grown from 60 years of age in the 1920s to about 80 years almost a century later. the strength of our public health system is being challenged, writes john sutter. sutter: doctors need to mobilize around public health issues. a lack of connection among specialties affects the efficacy of both clinical and public health efforts. the lack of connection between specialties affects the efficacy of both clinical and public health efforts. family medicine residency training programs only have 2 years to train them in all aspects of family practice, including public health. the lack of appropriately trained physicians currently working in the public health sphere is detrimental to the health of the Canadian population. we believe these benefits stem from multifaceted and comprehensive public health training offered by formal training programs that could be incorporated in curricula. a broad but thorough understanding of the functioning of the system is paramount for family physicians to be effective in the public health role. public health training first needs to permeate family medicine residency programs through the integration of core public health courses within curricula and hands-on graded clinical responsibilities. this would equip family physicians with tools to proactively address public health issues as they arise within their communities."}
