{"summary": "EAV is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus in the family Arteriviridae. it is the causative agent of equine viral arteritis (EVA) in horses. clinical signs range from an asymptomatic infection to a flu-like illness in adult horses, abortion in pregnant mares, and interstitial pneumonia in neonatal foals. the process of viral entry into target cells is initiated by binding to a specific host cell receptor molecule(s) on the plasma membrane (14\u201318) this interaction is a major determinant of viral tropism and pathogenesis. previous studies have implicated the involvement of a heparin-like molecule in binding to rabbit kidney (RK-13) cells (19, 20) soluble huCXCL16 is expressed in both membrane-bound and soluble forms. the membrane-bound form has scavenger receptor activity for phosphatidylserine and oxidized lipoprotein (SR-PSOX) huCXCL16 is also involved in viral infections, arthritis, atherosclerosis and the metastasis of certain cancers. human embryonic kidney cells were propagated in DMEM with 10% ferritin-supplemented bovine calf serum (HyClone Laboratories, Inc., Logan, UT) and 100 U/ml of penicillin and 100 g/ml of streptomycin (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA) both viruses were propagated in EECs to generate high-titer working stocks. titers expressed as the number of PFU per milliliter (38) horses used for collection of blood samples were maintained at pasture on the University of Kentucky Department of Veterinary Science's Main Chance Farm, Lexington, KY. the sequence encoding the entire EqCXCL16 without the first 16 amino acid residues from the signal sequences was amplified from cDNA made from mRNA extracted from equine monocytes. for cloning purposes, the forward and reverse primers were flanked with XhoI and BamHI restriction endonuclease recognition sequences. the resultant plasmid construct (p15-16A) was used to transform E. coli NovaBlue (EMD Millipore Novagen, Temecula, CA) in order to express recombinant protein, the plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells (EMD Millipore Novagen, Temecula, CA) recombinant protein was dialyzed against PBS using slide-A-Lyser dialysis cassettes. the purity and integrity of recombinant protein was determined with a bicinchonininic acid protein assay. adult new Zealand white rabbits were immunized with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH)-conjugated synthetic peptide antigens. each KLH-conjugated peptide (0.25 mg) was emulsified with Freund's complete adjuvant. each guinea pig was immunized with 0.1 mg of each peptide with incomplete Freund's adjuvant. rabbit antipeptide sera and polyclonal guinea pig sera were initially tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using either the respective peptides or the EqCXCL16 recombinant protein. the antisera were further characterized by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and Western blot (WB) analyses. 16 protein in 0.1 M bicarbonate/carbonate buffer, pH 9.6, were used to coat the 96-well ELISA plates (Corning, Tewksbury, MA) the plates were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C and washed twice with wash buffer (PBS, pH 7.4; Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) the reactions were blocked with 200 l of blocking solution (5% nonfat dry milk in wash buffer) for 1 h. plasmid was identified as pJ609-EqCXCL16 and used to transform DH10B cells. the recombinant plasmid DNA was purified using a commercial kit (Plasmid Plus maxiprep kit; Qiagen, Valencia, CA) fresh medium containing 4 g/ml of puromycin was incubated at 37\u00b0C in a CO2 incubator. puromycin-resistant cells were cloned by limiting dilution in 96-well plates and screened by IFA. clones showing highest level of EqCXCL16 protein expression were frozen in commercial cell-freezing medium. all cells were washed again in 10 mM PBS-glycine and blocked with 5% normal goat serum (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA) for 30 min at RT prior to incubation with specific primary antibodies for 1 h at 37\u00b0C in a humidified chamber maintained in total darkness. slides were mounted in a mounting medium containing 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (AF488; 1:200 dilution) the membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat milk powder (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (TBS-T; 10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.6], 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at RT. on the following day, the membranes were washed with TBS-T and then incubated with primary Abs. -glycosidase F (PNGase F; New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA) was lysed in RIPA lysis buffer. 20 micrograms of protein lysate and 1 l of 10 glycoprotein denaturing buffer were mixed. mixture was incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C. cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium with 2 mM GlutaMAX medium and 25 mM HEPES (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) without FBS and counted using a Countess automated cell counter. negative control was mock-infected PBMCs, which were cultured under conditions identical to those described above. cells were incubated with anti-equine CD14 clone 105 conjugated with Alexa Fluor 647 for 30 min on ice. after washing, the cells were resuspended in flow buffer. cell surface EqCXCL16 protein was blocked using polyclonal guinea pig antiserum (Gp anti-serum) 104 stable HEK-293T cell transfectants expressing the EqCXCL16 protein (HEK-EqCXCL16 cells) were seeded per well of a 96-well plate and incubated for 18 h at 37\u00b0C. after 2 h of incubation at 37\u00b0C, the cells were infected with anti-EqCXCL16 antibody. a commercially available nonspecific scrambled siRNA duplex was used as a negative control. at 30 h posttransfection, cells were infected with EqCXCL16 pAb. after 18 h of additional incubation, cells were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer and analyzed for viral nonstructural protein 1 (nsp-1) expression. -293T cells or stable HEK-EqCXCL16 cells were separated in 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto a PVDF membrane for far-WB analysis. bound proteins were then denatured and gradually renatured on the membrane by sequential incubation with 6 M, 3 M, 1 M, and 0.1 M guanidine-HCl in freshly prepared AC buffer. the membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS-T excess unbound biotin was removed by filtering through a Zeba desalt spin column (molecular weight cutoff, 7,000; Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) equilibrated in PBS (pH 7.4) cells were washed in cold PBS (pH 7.4) and removed from the culture dish using a nonenzymatic cell dissociation solution (Cellstripper; Mediatech Inc., Manassas, VA) goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L)-HRP, goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 and goat anti-guinea pig IgG (H+L) conjugated to AF488 were purchased from Life Technologies. two strains of EAV, the virulent Bucyrus strain (VBS; VR-796; ATCC) (5, 6) and recombinant EAV VBS expressing mCherry (eAV sVBSmCherry) were used in this study. both viruses were propagated in EECs to generate high-titer working stocks. purified preparations of each strain of EAV were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) and frozen at 80\u00b0C. titers were expressed as the number of PFU per milliliter (38). horses used for collection of blood samples were maintained at pasture on the University of Kentucky Department of Veterinary Science's Main Chance Farm, Lexington, KY. libraries with 500-bp inserts were prepared and sequenced as paired-end reads on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencer (2 times 100-bp sequences) reads were mapped to the horse genome reference sequence (Ecab 2.0) using CLC Workbench (version 8.0.1; CLC bio, Boston, MA) the fragment was digested with the XhoI and BamHI restriction enzymes. the resultant plasmid construct (p15-16A) was used to transform E. coli NovaBlue (EMD Millipore Novagen, Temecula, CA) using a ZR plasmid miniprep kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA) recombinant EqCXCL16 protein was purified from the supernatant by affinity chromatography using Talon Superflow metal affinity resin. the columns were equilibrated and washed with buffer A, while proteins were eluted using buffer B. the protein concentration was determined with a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) one peptide (peptide A; 39-RFPSDSPPAVHIMKHFRK-56; Fig. 1A) was located within the amino-terminal ectodomain of the EqCXCL16 protein. the other peptide (peptide B; 174-HSLVSGPEAGENQKQLKEHV-193; Fig. 1A) was located toward the end of the ectodomain. the rabbit antipeptide sera and polyclonal guinea pig sera were initially tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using either the respective peptides or the EqCXCL16 recombinant protein. the antisera were further characterized by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and Western blot (WB) analyses. threefold serial dilutions of purified recombinant EqCXCL16 protein in 0.1 M bicarbonate/carbonate buffer, pH 9.6, were used to coat the 96-well ELISA plates (Corning, Tewksbury, MA) the plates were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C and washed twice with wash buffer containing 0.05% Tween 20 (Bio-Rad, Hercules CA) a codon-optimized full-length EqCXCL16 sequence was commercially synthesized and cloned into the pJ609 plasmid. this molecular construct was identified as pJ609-EqCXCL16 and used to transform E. coli DH10B cells. the recombinant plasmid DNA was purified using a commercial kit. puromycin-resistant cells were cloned by limiting dilution in 96-well plates and screened by IFA. at every 5th passage and up to the 50th serial passage, cells were analyzed by IFA using Gp anti-EqCXCL16 pAb to confirm the expression of EqCXCL16. glycine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in PBS, pH 7.4 (PBS-glycine) washed again in 10 mM PBS-glycine and blocked with 5% normal goat serum. cells were incubated with antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (AF488; 1:200 dilution) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. the membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat milk powder (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (TBS-T; 10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.6], 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at RT and incubated with primary Abs (rabbit PA7506 anti-EqCXCL16 [1:500], rabbit PA75 EqCXCL16 proteins expressed in BHK-21 cells were deglycosylated using peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F; New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA) the denatured proteins were mixed with 2 l of 10 GlycoBuffer 2 (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA), 2 l of 10% NP-40, and 1 l of PNGase F enzyme in the cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium with 2 mM GlutaMAX medium and 25 mM HEPES (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) without FBS and counted using a Countess automated cell counter. the negative control was mock-infected PBMCs, which were cultured under conditions identical to those described above. cells were washed and incubated with anti-CD14 (clone 105; Bettina Wagner, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY) for 20 min. cells were then washed and incubated with anti-CD14 (clone 105; Bettina Wagner, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY) for 30 min on ice. cell surface EqCXCL16 protein was blocked using polyclonal guinea pig antiserum (Gp anti-EqCXCL16 pAb) 1 104 stable HEK-293T cell transfectants expressing the EqCXCL16 protein (HEK-EqCXCL16 cells) were seeded per well of a 96-well plate and incubated for 18 h at 37\u00b0C before being treated with 2-fold serial dil qCXCL16 cells seeded (1 105 cells/well) in 24-well plates were transfected with small interfering RNA (siRNA) directed against EqCXCL16 using the Lipofectamine RNAiMax reagent (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) these consisted of two Silencer Select siRNA duplexes designed using the GeneAssist custom siRNA builder (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) virus overlay protein-binding assay (VOPBA) and far-Western blotting. 100 g of total protein lysate from naive HEK-293T cells or stable HEK-EqCXCL16 cells was separated in 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. the bound proteins were then denatured and gradually renatured on the membrane by sequential incubation. about 2 mg of purified EAV was biotinylated using EZ-Link sulfo-NHS-biotin. cells were washed in cold PBS (pH 7.4) containing 2% FBS (PBS-F), centrifuged at 1,000 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C and incubated with biotinylated EAV at an MOI of 100. mouse EAV anti-GP5 and mouse EAV anti-nsp-1 MAbs have been described previously. goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L)-HRP and goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L)-HRP were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA) the EqCXCL16 gene is located on equine chromosome 11 (ECA11), spanning nucleotide positions 49746891 to 49750292, and is predicted to comprise 6 exons encoding a 247-amino-acid protein with an approximate molecular mass of 27.2 kDa. we analyzed these sequences using the simple modular architecture research tool (SMART) reagents to detect EqCXCL16-specific antipeptide and polyclonal antisera were not available. reagents were generated by immunization of rabbits with EqCXCL16 peptide A (aa residues 39 to 56) or peptide B (aa residues 174 to 193) and by inoculation of guinea pigs with recombinant EqCXCL16 antigen (aa residues 17 differential glycosylation is responsible for the double band (approximate molecular mass, 30 kDa) observed with all preparations of the EqCXCL16 antiserum (Fig. 2C, panels a, c, and e) this was confirmed by the disappearance of the upper band from the doublet (Fig. 2D) observed following peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) treatment of an EqCX lysates from BHK-21 cells transfected with either plasmid pJ609-GFP (control) or pJ609-EqCXCL16 were deglycosylated using PNGase F. the protein lysates were deglycosylated using rabbit PA7509 anti-EqCXCL16 antiserum. rabbit anti-EqCXCL16 antibody (peptide B, rabbit PA7509) and antibody against monocyte-specific marker CD14 showed that both antibodies bound to only 36% of the cells. the specificity of these reactions was confirmed by the fact that less than 1% of equine monocytes (Fig. 3A) bound to prebleed serum from the same rabbit (rabbit PA7509) the cells were stained for anti-CD14 and rabbit PA7509 anti-EqCXCL16 peptide Ab. 34% of the cells were positive for CD14 (CD14+) and EqCXCL16 (EqCXCL16+) all the cells that were mCherry positive were plotted for EqCXCL16 and CD14 expression (upper right) infected CD14+ cells incubated without antibody or with preimmunization guinea pig serum. 105 cells were plated in a 96-well plate in complete RPMI 1640 medium. monocytes were also treated with prebleed guinea pig serum from the same guinea pig. cal microscopy revealed that the stably transfected HEK-293T cells expressed EqCXCL16 on the outer plasma membrane. this conclusion was arrived at on the basis of the fact that the cells were not permeabilized by detergent treatment during the staining procedure. in contrast, HEK-EqCXCL16 cells did not show any staining with prebleed serum from the same guinea pig. similar results were seen with sVBSmCherry used at an MOI of 0.1 and 2.0. the data revealed that there was a significant difference in the intensity of mCherry expression in stable HEK-EqCXCL16 cells compared to that in naive HEK-293T cells. naive and stable cells were infected with EAV, and at 18 hpi cells were analyzed using virus-specific antibodies. HEK-293T cells were transfected with plasmid pJ609-EqCXCL16. hek-293T cells were surface stained with Gp anti-EqCXCL16 Ab. hek-293T cells were also stained with Gp anti-EqCXCL16 Ab. a significant increase in the level of mCherry expression was found in the stable HEK-EqCXCL16 cells. the intensity of mCherry expression was quantitated using Nikon NIS-Elements AR (version 4.13.00) software. the data represent the means standard deviation from 3 independent experiments. anti-EqCXCL16 polyclonal antibodies block EAV infection of HEK-EqCXCL16 cells. cells treated with similar 2-fold serial dilutions of prebleed guinea pig sera were considered negative controls. results also demonstrated that the inhibitory effect of pAb on EAV infection was dose dependent. HEK-EqCXCL16 cells were treated with either DMEM (a), serial dilutions (from 1:10 to 1:160) of Gp anti-EqCXCL16 pAb (b to f), or prebleed guinea pig sera (g to k) for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. stable cells infected with EAV sVBSmCherry expressed mCherry (a), whereas antibody treatment inhibited mCherry expression was readily detectable in equivalently infected nontransfected and scrambled siRNA-transfected HEK-EqCXCL16 cells. transfection with siRNA1 almost completely eliminated EAV nsp-1 compared with the amount of EAV nsp-1 in the scrambled siRNA-transfected controls. similar results were obtained with HEK-EqCXCL16 cells transfected with siRNA2. mock-transfected cells (row a) or cells transfected with scrambled siRNA (row b) were considered negative controls. at 30 h posttransfection, cells were infected with EAV sVBSmCherry at an MOI of 1.0 for 18 h. a combination of the virus overlay protein-binding assay (VOPBA) and far-WB techniques investigated this possibility. protein-protein interactions are detected in vitro by electrophoresis followed by immobilization of the prey protein on a PVDF membrane. lysates from HEK-EqCXCL16 cells and naive HEK-293T cells were transferred onto a PVDF membrane. naive HEK-EqCXCL16 or naive HEK-293T cell lysates were separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a PVDF membrane. the proteins in the membrane were denatured and renatured using sequentially decreasing concentrations of guanidine-HCl. naive HEK-293T and HEK-EqCXCL16 cells were incubated with biotinylated EAV VBS (MOI of 100) at 4\u00b0C for 2 h, streptavidin-FITC was added. expression of EqCXCL16 produced a significant (P 0.01) increase in the level of binding of biotinylated EAV VBS to HEK-293T cells. a total of 300 cells were counted using Nikon NIS-Elements AR (version 4.13.00) software. the percentage of stable HEK-EqCXCL16 cells showed EAV binding was calculated. previous studies have implicated an association between EqCXCL16 and EAV during infection of some horses (11) equine protein likely possesses scavenger receptor activity for phosphatidylserine and oxidized lipoprotein (SR-PSOX)/CXC. sequences from the two horses were used to design a codon-optimized variant of EqCXCL16 for transfection of mammalian cell lines. serum collected from all rabbits at 56 days postimmunization produced no detectable reactions against the recombinant EqCXCL16 antigen. results were corroborated using IFA and WB analysis on BHK-21 cells transiently transfected with pJ609-EqCXCL16. this was confirmed by the disappearance of the upper band from the doublet. rabbit PA7506 anti-EqCXCL16 and rabbit PA7509 anti-EqCXCL16 were coated on a 96-well plate. they were then probed with antisera generated against peptides A and B. at 24 h posttransfection, cells were fixed in 4% PFA. protein lysates from BHK-21 cells transfected with either plasmid pJ609-GFP (control) or plasmid pJ609-EqCXCL16 were deglycosylated using PNGase F. experiments were conducted to investigate if EqCXCL16 plays a role in EAV infection of equine monocytes. equine monocytes expressing CXCL16 were susceptible to EAV infection. PBMCs (2 106) were stained with anti-CD14 antibody and rabbit PA7509 anti-EqCXCL16 serum. plots were generated using WinList software with cells gated for monocytes on the basis of their scatter. equine monocytes enriched (>85% purity) by selection with anti-CD14 antibody-conjugated magnetic microbeads were incubated with Gp anti-EqCXCL16 pAb for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. monocytes were treated with prebleed guinea pig serum from the same guinea pig (c) s were then infected with EAV sVBSmCherry, and at 24 hpi, cells were analyzed by inverted immunofluorescence microscopy for the evaluation of mCherry expression. preliminary results showed that EAV infects only a small minority of the HEK-293T cell population (3%) molecular mass of 30 kDa was observed in cell lysates from HEK-EqCXCL16 cells. expression of EqCXCL16 was maintained for more than 50 serial passages. expression of EqCXCL16 was maintained for more than 50 serial passages. the IFA data using an anti-nsp-1 MAb (MAb 12A4) showed a significant increase in the level of expression of EAV nonstructural protein nsp-1 in the stable HEK-EqCXCL16 cells. despite similar levels of loading of cell lysate material in terms of actin amounts, EAV nsp-1 was readily detectable in naive HEK-293T cells. naive HEK-293T cells (row a) or stable HEK-EqCXCL16 cells expressing the EqCXCL16 protein (row b) were infected with EAV sVBSmCherry at an MOI of 1.0. at 12 hpi, the cells were fixed with 4% PFA. the same fields of cells were also analyzed by phase-contrast microcopy. at 18 hpi, cells were fixed with 4% PFA and stained with an anti-nsp-1 MAb (MAb 12A4) conjugated with AF488. there was a significant increase in the level of EAV nsp-1 expression in stable HEK-EqCXCL16 cells compared to that in naive HEK-293T cells. untreated HEK-EqCXCL16 cells could still be infected with the virus. the inhibitory effect of pAb on EAV infection was dose dependent. prebleed guinea pig sera could not block EAV sVBSmCherry infection of HEK-EqCXCL16 cells. HEK-EqCXCL16 cells were transfected with siRNA1 or siRNA2. siRNA1 and siRNA2 were able to significantly reduce surface expression of EqCXCL16. mCherry expression was readily detectable in equivalently infected nontransfected and scrambled siRNA-transfected HEK-EqCXCL16 cells. transfection with siRNA1 almost completely eliminated EqCXCL16 expression compared with the amount of EAV nsp-1 in the scrambled siRNA-transfected controls. similar results were obtained with EAV-infected HEK-EqCXCL16 cells transfected with siRNA2. this molecule can act as a putative host cell surface receptor. HEK-EqCXCL16 cells were transfected with siRNA1. at 30 h posttransfection, the cells were infected with EAV sVBSmCherry. the cells were lysed and analyzed by a WB assay using nsp-1 (a), -actin (b), and rabbit anti-EqCXCL16 (c) anti-GP5 MAb 6D10 specifically recognizes EAV envelope protein GP5. the anti-GP5 MAb reacted strongly with immobilized cell lysates from HEK-EqCXCL16 cells but not those from naive HEK-293T cells. the membrane was reprobed with anti-eqCXCL16 pAb. membranes were incubated with anti-GP5 MAb 6D10 and developed using the ECL method. antibodies were stripped off the membrane shown in panel a and reprobed with Gp anti-EqCXCL16. a binding assay was performed at 4\u00b0C to prevent viral internalization. equal numbers (2 106) of naive HEK-293T cells or stable HEK-EqCXCL16 cells were washed and resuspended in cold PBS (pH 7.4) and then incubated with biotinylated EAV-VBS on ice for 2 h in the dark. after 3 washings, excess EAV was removed by washing in cold PBS-F, and the cells were then stained with streptavidin-FITC the transmembrane form of EqCXCL16 can function as a binding receptor for EAV. a majority of monocytes include a subpopulation that expresses EqCXCL16. a majority of monocytes include a subpopulation that expresses EqCXCL16. enriched CD14+ equine monocytes were preincubated with Gp anti-EqCXCL16 pAb. a reduction in the number of cells expressing the mCherry protein significantly blocked EAV infection. this conclusion was strongly supported by evidence obtained with HEK-293T cells demonstrating that EqCXCL16 is important early in the EAV infection process. studies performed on heparinase-treated cells (19, 20) suggest that an association with heparin is involved in infection of cells with EAV. this probably functions as an attachment factor mediating nonspecific interactions that facilitate the concentration of virus particles on the cell surface prior to actual receptor binding. CD151, CD163, dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3 grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN; CD209), and vimentin, although the first two probably function as attachment factors rather than specific cellular receptors. however, the use of scavenger receptors as host cell receptors is not. heparin sulfate may be involved as an attachment factor enabling the concentration of EAV particles on the cell surface. heparin sulfate may be involved as an attachment factor enabling the concentration of EAV particles."}
