{"summary": "high compliance in healthcare workers to hand hygiene was primarily driven by fear. however, the post-SARS period confirmed that this practice was not sustainable. a multi-prong approach was used in designing the hand hygiene program. the hand hygiene program was revised in early 2007 following Singapore's signing of the pledge to the world health organization (WHO) \"Clean Care is Safer Care\" program. from 2007, more alcohol hand rub bottles were installed along ward corridors and near food establishments in the hospital ground. c. Powerpoint slides with detailed explanation of the 5 moments were created for doctors, nurses and allied health. feedback surveys are conducted annually amongst staffs to gather feedback and comments on products used or issues faced during practice. the hand hygiene program was an integral part of an ongoing MRSA reduction program in the hospital. the \"MRSA bundle\" includes five components of care. the bundle was first introduced by the Institute of Healthcare Improvement in 2006. BH was the coordinator in the hand hygiene program. all authors have read and approved this manuscript for publication."}
