{"summary": "around 30 million patients worldwide are at high risk of developing IA every year. over 200,000 patients develop the infection annually. IA continues to be a life-threatening infection in an increasing proportion of immunocompromised or critically ill subjects. polymorphisms within or near immune-related genes may contribute to determine the risk of developing the infection. a substantial proportion of the susceptibility markers identified to date for IA are located in genes directly or indirectly implicated in the activation of the nuclear factor-kappa B signaling pathway. single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within toll-like receptors may render patients more likely to develop the infection. we hypothesized that the presence of common genetic polymorphisms within these genes might influence the risk of developing IA in high-risk patients. we hypothesized that the presence of common nucleotide polymorphisms within these genes might influence the risk of developing IA in high-risk patients. 148 patients were recruited from two italian medical institutions. of those 834 patients, a total of 157 patients were diagnosed with proven or probable IA. the remaining 677 patients did not show any sign of fungal infection. morphisms were carried out at GENYO using KASPar\u00ae assays. 5% of samples were randomly selected and included as duplicates. Concordance between the original and the duplicate samples was 99.0%. Weinberg Equilibrium test was performed in the control group (non-IA patients) by a standard observed-expected chi-square (2). logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, country of origin, allo-HSCT, underlying disease and prophylaxis status was used to assess the main effects of the selected SNPs on IA risk. analysis based on a single SNP performed haplotype frequency estimation and haplotype association analysis using SNPStats. the minimum haplotype frequency was set at 0.01, thus assessing association for common haplotypes. eight hundred and thirty-four high-risk European Caucasian patients undergoing allo-HSCT or being diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) were recruited in this case-control population-based study. 148 patients were recruited from two italian medical institutions. gene dbSNP rs# Chr.

Statistical analysis The Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium test was performed in the control group (non-IA patients) logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, country of origin, allo-HSCT, underlying disease and prophylaxis status. the significant threshold used for the main effect analysis was 0.001 ([0.05]/13 independent genetic markers]/4 inheritance models) haplotype blocks were constructed from the genotyping data of the non-IA control group using the SNPtool (http://www.dkfz.de/de/molgen_epidemiology/tools/SNPtool.html) MDR models were considered statistically significant at P 0.05 (P sign). Statistical significance of each particular model was then re-evaluated. interactions were visualized by constructing an interaction dendrogram according to the method described by Moore et al. 69 16.07 NS Sex ratio (male/female) 1.28 (466/362) 1.86 (99/53) 1.18 (367/309) 0.015 HEMATOLOGICAL DISEASE AML 571 (68.62) 112 (71.33) 459 (68.00) NS ALL 77 (09.25) 18 (11.46) 59 (08.74) NS Other 184 (22.11) 27 (17.19) 157 (23.25) NS HSCT 380 (45.5 logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, country of origin, allo-HSCT, and underlying disease showed that none of the selected SNPs was significantly associated with the risk of IA according to codominant, dominant, recessive and log-additive models of inheritance. no significant associations between the NFB1, NFB2, cRel, RelB, and IRF4 polymorphisms and IA risk were also found in an allo-HSCT-re the IRF4rs12203592 SNP resides on a strong enhancer and near an active promoter that might constitute a regulatory element for IRF4. this intronic polymorphism was predicted to change binding motifs for NFB, HDAC2, and HMG-IY. the rs12203592 SNP mapped among promoter and enhancer histone marks in different primary T-cell subtypes (TCD8+, TCD4+, Treg, and Variant_dbSNP Gene Effect-allele OR (95% CI)a Pvalue OR (95% CI)b Pvalue OR (95% CI)c Pvalue rs4648110 NFB1 A 0.69 (0.46\u20131.03) 0.07 0.73 (0.30\u20131.81) 0.50 0.74 (0.53\u20131.04) 0.08 rs12769316 NFB2 A 0.87 (0.57\u20131.31) 0.50 0.79 (0.23\u20132.73) 0.70 0.87 (0. 82 (0.59\u20131.14) 0.24 rs1050975 IRF4 G 1.00 (0.61\u20131.63) 0.99 2.69 (0.75\u20139.61) 0.13 1.10 (0.72\u20131.68) 0.67 rs7768807 IRF4 C 1.33 (0.92\u20131.94) 0.13 1.26 (0.66\u20132.40) 0.48 1.24 (0.93\u20131.65) 0.14 rs12203592 IRF4 T 1.01 (0.66\u20131.53) 0. 4851 NFB2 T 1.59 (0.56\u20134.53)* 0.38 NA (NA\u2013NA) NA (NA\u2013NA) NA rs842647 cREL G 0.81 (0.40\u20131.64) 0.55 0.94 (0.23\u20133.74) 0.93 0.86 (0.48\u20131.53) 0.61 rs13017599 cREL A 0.84 (0.42\u20131.68) 0.62 1.50 (0.61\u20133.67) 0.38 1.03 (0.63\u20131.68) 0.91 b Estimates calculated according to a recessive model of inheritance. c Estimates calculated according to an additive model of inheritance. 4rs1877175 IRF4rs7768807 IRF4rs12203592 Freq OR(95%CI)a P-value IRF4rs1050975 IRF4rs1877175 IRF4rs7768807 IRF4rs12203592 Freq OR(95%CI)a P-value A G T C 0.4034 1.00 \u2013 A G T C 0.3536 1.00 \u2013 A G C C 0.1948 1.32 the best model suggested an interaction between the RELrs842647, NFB2rs1056890, IRF4rs7768807, and RELrs13017599 SNPs to synergistically increase the risk of developing IA (TA = 0.5488, PSign = 0.0010) none of the best models included the IRF4rs12203592 SNP. cross-validation and cross validation testing were used to identify the best models. the model with the highest testing balanced accuracy (TA) and cross validation consistency (CVC) was selected as \u201cbest model\u201d. NEMO-IKK-IKK and NFB-p50/p65 complexes can be activated by membrane pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as toll-like receptors (TLRs; Mambula et al., 2002; Bellocchio et al., 2004; Roeder et al., 2004); soluble PRRs like pentraxins (PTX3; Garlanda et al., 2011); cytokin lectins and the activation of certain TNF family cytokines lead to the activation of the non-canonical NFB pathway (p52/RelB), which is implicated in B-cell and DC maturation. it has recently been suggested the existence of a CD30-p52/Relb-IRF4 loop to regulate the NFB pathway and cell proliferation (Boddicker et al., 2015) this is the first study that attempts to evaluate the impact of polymorphisms within PRRs (TLR2, TLR4, TLR9, Dectin-1, Dectin-2, DC-SIGN, PTX3; Kesh et al., 2005; Bochud et al., 2008; Pamer, 2008; Cunha et al., 2010, 2011, 2011, 2014; Chai et al., 2010, 2011; Chai et al., the association of this variant with IA did not remain significant at the experiment-wide significance threshold. the magnitude of these effects suggested that the observed association was likely due to the IRF4rs12203592 SNP rather than the combined effect of the IRF4 SNPs. this case-control study does not provide strong evidence of a relationship between polymorphisms within NFB1, NFB2, cRel, RelB, and IRF4 genes and IA risk. the trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01742026) and EudraCT (2010-019406-17).
