Metadp [54] and NNput are meta servers that comprise a number of domain prediction methods. no information provided by authors. predicted domain boundaries were obtained from the CASP7 web page. the experimental domain boundaries were also obtained from the CASP7 web page. 95 proteins are considered. this results in a set of 1210 predictions. the prediction accuracy was validated with a Jack-knife procedure. the test is deemed the most objective that can always yield a unique result for a given benchmark dataset. a random prediction is based on idea that the problem of domain boundary prediction is a classification problem. it is possible to compute the Jaccard index (J), the Rand coefficient (R) and the Fowlkes-Mallows index (FM) which are defined as: J = n _ ss n _ ss + n _ ds (2) R = n _ ss + n _ dd M (3) FM = n _ ss n _ ss + n _ dd (4) where M = n it is clear that C and K are more similar to each other than D and L. however, it is more difficult to estimate the probability that C and K are really more similar to each other than D and L. Fig. (1) shows the distributions of the index R for some N values. it appears that the distribution dispersion decreases if N increases. it appears that the maximum moves to higher R values for larger proteins. homology prediction is presented by the chop [48, 49] methods that assign the query sequence to known PDB chains. the homology prediction is presented by the chop [48, 49] methods that assign the query sequence to known PDB chains. maopus performs a template screening with PSI-BLAST and FFAS03. The SKELEFOLD approach implemented in Maopus is a de novo folding algorithm that uses vector representations of secondary structural elements. metadp [54] and NNput are meta servers that comprise a number of domain prediction methods. predicted domain boundaries were obtained from the CASP7 web page. the experimental domain boundaries were also obtained from the CASP7 web page. 95 proteins are considered. fp fn + tp tn + fp fp + tp fn + tn, (1) the values of which range from -1 to +1 (larger values indicate better predictions) the prediction accuracy was validated with a Jack-knife procedure. i and j were classified in the same group in C and in different groups in K (n_ss) the number of cases in which i and j were classified into two different groups both in C and in K (n_dd) it is possible to compute the Jaccard index (J), the Rand coefficient (R), and the Fowlkes-Mallows index (FM) the computation of the values of J, R, and FM is elementary. this depends on the fact that the probability density functions of the indices J, R, and FM are unknown. 10,000 random partitions into domains were generated for proteins containing 75, 100, 125,..., 550, 575, 600 residues. it was then possible to make 49,995,000 pairwise comparisons between two partitions. a positive value of Delta_e indicates that the domain is predicted to be slightly longer, at its C-terminus, than the reality. single-domain proteins tend to be smaller than multi-domain proteins, though some overlap between the two distributions exists. data are taken from the proteins examined in the CASP7 experiment. it is interesting to compare results of this extremely simple prediction strategy with the results obtained within the CASP7 experiment. the same classification in tp, fp, fn, and tn, which is described in the Methods section, was used. mcc baker 0.722 chop 0.178 chophomo 0.230 distill 0.260 domfold 0.262 domssea 0.410 dps 0.277 foldpro 0.840 hhpred1 0.304 hhpred3 0.272 maopus 0.696 metadp 0.189 NNput 0.189 NNput 0.097 robetta 0.734 What does this mean? the probability pJ to find J values larger than those observed by comparing the reality and the predictions of the method \"baker\" is on average equal to 39%, it decreases to 33% for proteins shorter than large. pJ, pR, and pFM values can be used only as semi-quantitative indicators. a very positive feature of these computational methods is that when they work they work very well. the percentage of good predictions is about 30-40%, with some prediction methods behaving considerably better than others. domfold 38.0 -1.9(0.6) 2.9(0.7) domfold 38.0 -1.9(0.6) 2.9(0.7) domssea 42.9 -1.7(0.6) 2.5(0.7) dps 38.7 -2.2(0.8) 1.6(0.9) foldpro 62.8 -1.3(0.4) 2.0(0.4) hhpred1 43.3 -2.1(0.5) 2.6(0.5) hhpred3 43.4 -2.1( single- and muti-domain proteins tend to be smaller than multi-domain proteins. it is therefore easy to select a threshold value t and to predict that a protein contains only one domain if smaller than t and that it is multi-domain protein if larger than t. mcc values were computed on the basis of the predictions deposited by the participants to the CASP7 experiment. the same classification in tp, fp, fn, and tn was used. if protein P contains more than a single domain by the prediction method M, this was considered a true positive (tp), etc. is the Partition Correct\" Table 4 shows the average values of the J, R, and FM indices computed by comparing predicted and real partitions. all the values tend to be large, quite close to their maximum value of 1. the probability pJ to find J values larger than those observed by comparing the reality and the predictions of the method \"baker\" is on average equal to 39%, it decreases to 33% for proteins shorter than 150 residues, and it increases to 43% for proteins containing more then 150 amino acids. this is actually not surprising, since it is easier to predict that a small protein contains a single domain. a very positive feature of these computational methods is that when they work they work very well. the percentage of good predictions is about 30-40%, with some prediction methods behaving considerably better than others. the average values of Delta_b are close to and lower than 0 for all the prediction methods. a deviation of 1-3 residues is probably a very minor mistake in the process of design a protein construct that has, on average, a high probability to be well folded and conformationally homogeneous. a deviation of 1-3 residues is probably a very minor mistake in the process of design a protein construct that has a high probability to be well folded and conformationally homogeneous. this work was supported by the Austrian GEN-AU project BIN-II.
