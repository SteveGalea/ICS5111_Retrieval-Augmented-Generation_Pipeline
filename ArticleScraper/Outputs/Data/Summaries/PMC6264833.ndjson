{"summary": "Malawi adopted the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) strategy to develop its national surveillance system since 2002. revised its guideline to fulfill the IHR requirements in 2014. quantitative data were collected through interviews with 29 frontline health service providers from the selected district. new EVD outbreak emerged in the democratic Republic of the Congo in April 2018 [8]. challenges of implementing IDSR were evident even before the tragic EVD outbreak in 2014 [10\u201312]. ation into 5 zones, 29 health districts and 4 major cities. the official language of Malawi is English and national language is Chewa. tribal languages are used for communication in different districts. the system was upgraded to a web-based open-source information system, DHIS2 in 2012. the IDSR datasets are required to be entered intpDHIS2 by the focal person since late 2014. technical guidelines set the district performance target at 80% for timeliness. key informants included health workers involved in IDSR duties from the community to district level. the research team visited 17 HSAs who run village clinic. the researcher observed operation of the outpatient clinic in hospitals to obtain contextual information about the service provision and IDSR report generating process. all interviews and observations were administered after obtaining consents from the interviewees and digitally recorded for transcribing and translating by the local research assistant. a priori codes were developed based on the identification and reporting themes. the core functions of each level of health system actors were compared with the expected functions according to the guideline. study setting Malawi is a land-locked country situated in south-eastern Africa. each facility has a person responsible for tallying reportable cases. in the current guideline, 19 diseases and conditions are required immediately reporting (S1 Table) each district health office (DHO) has a district health management team (DHMT) overseeing health programmes. completeness is represented in percentage format and used as a quality indicator. timeliness of reporting was calculated based on the proportion of health facilities submitting surveillance reports on time to the district. the researcher resides in Malawi and has been working with the MOH for health system strengthening since 2007. to avoid communication difficulties with the HSAs, the researcher engaged a local female trained research assistant to facilitate interviews. the team visited 17 HSAs who run village clinic. the data were further stratified by dry season (May to October) and rainy season (November to April) and tested using two-tailed proportion Z-test. the level of significance was set at = 0.05. timeliness data were compared against the performance target (80%) in each district. the IDSR monthly report showed very poor performance in terms of timeliness. on annual basis, very few districts reached the target of 80% on-time reporting. timeliness was significantly poorer in the study district compared to the national average. key themes and sub-themes identified from key informants. key informants familiar with case definitions when it comes to child illness based on the integrated community case management guideline. DHMT, #RDHO02 Actual case identification practice We further analyzed how HSAs and HCWs performing actual case identifications at community and facility level. they relied on volunteers from the Village Health Committee (VHC) to report unusual health events. the community level HCWs identify notifiable cases through operating the clinic. the HSAs use the CCM register and reporting form as the tool for collecting surveillance data. there is no standardized tool has been used to collect detected and referred cases from community. the IDSR focal person also used computer to combine with paper registers. the HSAs gathered at the attached health facilities at the end of the month to generate reports using different registers. at the end of the month, those HSAs residing in different catchment areas come to meet at the health centre. the same happened for the IDSR focal person to generate required monthly IDSR reports using various surveillance tools. each HSA serves 3 to 24 villages and covering population size from 284 to 9,000 villagers. lack of comprehensive training was an obstacle to enhance the electronic system to capture more data for disease surveillance and decision-making. the new IDSR guidelines are in, but due to lack of funds they have not called us for orientation on the new guidelines. DHMT, #RDHO02 Supervision gap was huge and directly affected the district performance on the quality of the IDSR tasks. despite the understanding of most priority diseases case definition, the services provided at the community level may affect the ability of HSAs to identify cases timely. HCW, #RDH07 Another challenge related to case identification was lab diagnosis capacity. this also affected the ability of HCWs to identify notifiable cases. the ED expected to use technology to improve timeliness and capability to get IDSR report automatically. ED, #RDH04 The challenges to get timely reports through unstable information technology infrastructure were obstacles for the IDSR focal person in the DHO to provide quality reports. the data quality of IDSR monthly report submitted through HMIS was the concern for ED to use. DHMT, #RDHO01 The inadequate resources made the basic infrastructure of village clinics and health facilities insubstantial. only one of the 17 HSAs was working in a well-constructed building. the constrained resources heavily affect the performance of the IDSR system in the country. in the studied district, the completeness performance remained significantly better than the national average. the IDSR monthly reports completeness indicator from October 2014 to September 2016 divided by zones and national level. the study district did not achieve it throughout the study period. three key informants provided IDSR related information through interactive meetings and interviews at the ministry of health departments. majority of the informants were male (N = 22) age between 28 to 52 years old. DHMT, #RDHO02 Actual case identification practice We further analyzed how HSAs and HCWs performing actual case identifications at community and facility level. they relied on volunteers from the Village Health Committee (VHC) to report unusual health events. the village clinic was designed to provide health services to under five children. some HSAs were equipped and capable to do simple data analysis and use them as instrument to interact with the VHC for disease prevention and health promotion. but they did not perform active case finding based on the community case definitions. most of the HSAs are performing malaria rapid diagnosis at the village clinic. DHMT, #RDHO02 Actual case identification practice We analyzed how HSAs and HCWs performing actual case identifications at community and facility level. the IDSR technical guidelines, the HSAs are supposed to do active case finding to identify priority diseases and public health events. the village clinic was designed to provide health services to under five children. Upon case detected, the HSAs referred both children and adult cases to the next level health facilities. they did not perform active case finding based on their clinical judgements and epidemiological history. DHMT, #RDHO02 Lab confirmation Lab confirmation is an important activity of the case detection core function. the HSAs are performing malaria rapid diagnosis at the village clinic. some of them collect specimen at community while others refer patients to the health facilities for further tests. HSA, #ML02 At the facility level, the same happened for the IDSR focal person to generate required monthly IDSR reports using various surveillance tools. at the end of the month, they compile the data from the OPD registers and then they send it... from the OPD registers. if it\u2019s an outbreak we see that we cannot control, then we inform the DHO. the HSAs gathered at the attached health facilities at the end of the month to generate reports using different registers. at the end of every month, those HSAs residing in different catchment areas come to meet at the attached health facilities. the same happened for the IDSR focal person to generate required monthly IDSR reports using various surveillance tools. the majority mode of reporting by HSAs was on paper based submission. the majority mode of reporting was on paper based submission. one HSA uses smartphone for nutrition program reporting but not in surveillance. lack of comprehensive training was an obstacle to enhance the electronic system to capture more data for disease surveillance and decision-making. lack of comprehensive training was an obstacle to enhance the electronic system to capture more data for disease surveillance. lack of comprehensive training was an obstacle to enhance the electronic system to capture more data for disease surveillance and decision-making. lack of comprehensive training was an obstacle to enhance the electronic system to capture more data for disease surveillance and decision-making. people would then use the traditional medicines prior to the formal health services. this affected the ability of formal health care system to identify cases in time. this also affected the ability of HCWs to identify notifiable cases. ED, #MOH02 The challenges to get timely reports through unstable information technology infrastructure were obstacles for the IDSR focal person in the DHO to provide quality reports. the data quality of IDSR monthly report submitted through HMIS was the concern for ED to use. DHMT, #RDHO02 Financial challenge also affected the laboratory diagnosis capacity and ability to use computer systems for surveillance data capturing. lack of resources made the basic infrastructure of village clinics and health facilities insubstantial. most of them were operating in an unfinished or substandard location. the village clinic does not provide health services to adults. traditional medicines were commonly used at the community level. this affected the ability of formal health care system to identify cases in time. ED, #MOH01 The challenges to get timely reports through unstable information technology infrastructure were obstacles for the IDSR focal person in the DHO to provide quality reports. despite of EMR system in place, the heavy workload made it difficult for HCWs to capture clinical information on system for automate report compiling. ED, #MOH01 Financial, capacity and infrastructure Financial constrain was the root challenge for quality IDSR implementation. this created gaps for timely reporting, implementing weekly IDSR reports and having capacity to use the updated technical guideline. DHMT, #RDHO02 Financial challenge also affected laboratory diagnosis capacity and ability to use computer systems for surveillance data capturing. the lack of resources affects the performance of the IDSR system in the country. the villagers in Malawi are unable to take quick action and respond to the suspected health events. mHealth is fast adopting mHealth solutions to improve disease surveillance timeliness. a more integrated electronic IDSR system is essential for the health authorities to correspond the diverse demands. other notable issues were documented including technical, financial, infrastructural challenges, data security and medical support during the design and implementation process of mHealth surveillance in sub-Saharan africa countries. only focused on completeness and timeliness, and the accuracy attribute of the IDSR system performance was out of the scope of this study. however, according to the study result, we understand the inadequate laboratory infrastructure can affect the ability of case identification.
