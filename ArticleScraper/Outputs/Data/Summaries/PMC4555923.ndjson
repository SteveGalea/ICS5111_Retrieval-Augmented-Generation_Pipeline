{"summary": "human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are responsible for 5\u201330% of all upper respiratory tract infections in humans. their involvement in lower respiratory tract illness and gastroenteritis has also been reported. nsp15 of HCoV-229E has been reported to prevent viral RNA accumulation. nsp15s from sARS-CoV and mouse hepatitis virus share 42 and 40% sequence identity, respectively, with nsp15 from HCoV-229E. trimeric nsp15 from HCoV-229E was successfully obtained by mutating Ile26 and Asn52 to alanine. the complete gene fragment encoding HCoV-229E nsp15 was amplified by PCR using the forward primer 5\u2032-ACCGGGGATCCGGTTTAGAGAACATTGCTT-3\u2032. the resulting PCR product was digested with BamHI and XhoI, and was clon eluted fraction was mixed with 20 ml stock buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM Mg2+) the protein was ultrafiltered to 8 mg ml1 for subsequent crystallization. the purity of the protein was monitored by 12.0% SDS\u2013PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. smid forward primer ACCGGGGATCCGGTTTAGAGAACATTGCTT Cloning vector pGEX-6p-1 Expression vector pGEX-6p-1 Expression host E. coli Rosetta (DE3) Complete amino-acid sequence of the construct produced GPLGSGLENIAFNVVNKGSFVGADGELPVAASGDKVFVRDGNTDNLVFVNKTSLPTAIAFELFAKRKVGLTPPLSILKNLGVVATYKFV each crystallization drop consisted of 1 l protein solution and 1 l reservoir solution. small crystals were generated under several conditions containing PEG 3350 in 1 d. the concentration of PEG 3350 was further optimized manually. the crystals belonged to space group C2221, with unit-cell parameters a = 85.9, b = 137.5, c = 423.1, = = = 90\u00b0. data-collection statistics for the nsp15 mutant are summarized in Table 3. data were obtained using a two-channel centrepiece containing 390 l protein at 1 mM or buffer for reference. the data were acquired using an interferometer system and were analyzed using SEDFIT (Schuck et al., 2014. eluted fraction was mixed with 20 ml stock buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM Mg2+) the protein was ultrafiltered to 8 mg ml1 for subsequent crystallization. the purity of the protein was monitored by 12.0% SDS\u2013PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue.
