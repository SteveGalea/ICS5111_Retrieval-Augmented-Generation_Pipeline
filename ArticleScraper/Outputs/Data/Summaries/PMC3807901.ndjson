{"summary": "an appropriate amount of viral-population diversity is thought to aid viral adaptation in changing host environments. bottlenecks are stochastic reductions in the genetic diversity of a viral population. purifying selection remains operative and is one of the most important selective forces acting on arbovirus populations. yF disease has been eliminated in some areas by vaccination with the live attenuated vaccine strain YFV-17D and mosquito control programs. to investigate potential arbovirus bottlenecks in a vertebrate host, we chose to use YFV-17D as a model system. yFV-17D was severely attenuated in immunocompetent mice. yFV-17D rapidly disseminated in IFNAR/ mice, causing disease in 32% of mice. BL6-IFNAR/ mice were inoculated with 6 103 PFU of YFV-17D viral-pool mixture. tissues (muscle, sciatic nerve, blood, liver, spleen, and brain) were harvested at 7 to 8 days postinfection. supernatants were removed, cells were washed, and 5 ml of agarose overlay was added. cells were stained with an alcoholic crystal violet solution for plaque analysis. cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 with equivalent PFUs of each virus. mice were injected intramuscularly in the left quadriceps with 35 l of viral supernatant containing 1 103 of each of the genetically marked YFV-17D viruses. mice were monitored daily for signs of disease as described in the Results section and euthanized upon disease onset (7 to 8 days postinfection). mice with severe disease do not recover from infection, we euthanized moribund mice, and data are presented as percentages of mice without disease. supernatant virus stocks were used for viral-titer and diversity assays. for tissues containing low viral titers (e.g., blood), viral amplification in cell culture was necessary to generate enough viral RNA for the reverse transcription (RT)-PCR-based hybridization assay. the cell culture virus amplification step did not alter the number of pool members observed in tissues. RT-PCR products were blotted on nylon membranes and hybridized with 32P-labeled primer probes specific for each marked viral sequence. normalization was performed to eliminate cross-reactivity of probes by using mismatched products (all PCR products except for the one specific for the probe), which were loaded on each membrane as controls. BL6-IFNAR/ mice were inoculated i.m. with 6 103 PFU of the YFV-17D viral-pool mixture. tissues were harvested at disease onset (day 7 to 8 postinfection) or day 8 postinfection for mice not showing disease signs. differences that are not statistically significant are indicated by \u201cn.s.\u201d each PCR-generated region was confirmed by sequencing. yFV-17D genome highlighting the NS1 region where groups of silent point mutations (bold, underlined) were incorporated by site-directed mutagenesis. the gene Pulser Xcell electroporation system was used with settings of 850 V, 5-ms pulse length, 2 pulses, 5-s pulse interval, and 4-mm cuvette. the supernatants were harvested from 15-cm plates when a cytopathic effect was detected. cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 with equivalent PFUs of each virus. mice were injected intramuscularly in the left quadriceps with 35 l of viral supernatant containing 1 103 of each of the genetically marked YFV-17D viruses based on BHK-J titers. mice sacrificed at 1 to 3 days postinfection were perfused with 20 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. mice with disease onset were not perfused and there was no difference in viral tissue titers between perfused and nonperfused mice at disease onset. however, viral titers in the blood at 5 to 8 days postinfection were undetectable or at least 10-fold lower than in other tissues. however, mice with disease onset were not perfused and there was no difference between perfused and nonperfused mice at disease onset. l of serum-free medium was plated on confluent BHK-J cells for 1 h. virus was removed, cells were washed, and 2 ml of DMEM-2%FBS was added. RNA extraction and RT-PCR were performed as previously described. YFV-17D-inoculated BL6-IFNAR/ mice were inoculated i.m. with 6 103 PFU of the YFV-17D viral-pool mixture. BL6-IFNAR/ mice were harvested at disease onset (day 7 to 8 postinfection) and viral population diversity was assessed using the hybridization assay. s 7 to 8) times postinfection and used for both titer and viral population diversity assays. data are shown as PFU/tissue, except for blood titers. we created a similar assay to study YFV-17D dissemination and trafficking barriers. all 6 viruses were present after four serial passages, demonstrating absence of severe growth defects in vivo. to evaluate growth defects in vivo, we compiled 788 hybridization signals from numerous tissues from 33 mice at 7 to 8 days postinfection with our 6 marked YFV-17D viruses. therefore, none of the 6 viruses demonstrated a growth advantage or disadvantage in vivo. neurotropic disease manifested as paralysis ranging from one paralyzed leg to severe dual-leg paralysis, with occasional lethargy, walking in circles, and eye discharge. all mice that were asymptomatic at 8 days postinfection remained asymptomatic through 40 days postinfection. poliovirus encountered a major bottleneck between the inoculation site (muscle) and the brain in BL6-IFNAR+/+ mice. at 8 days postinfection, viral-population diversity was analyzed in various tissues including blood, brain, spleen, liver, sciatic nerve, and muscle. more marked viruses in the brain than in muscle of YFV-17D-infected BL6-IFNAR/ mice. a majority of the six marked viruses were present in muscle and brain of BL6-IFNAR/ mice regardless of whether they showed signs of disease. at 1 day postinfection, we detected virus only in the spleen, where approximately 50% of the viral-pool members were present. at 3 days postinfection, we found high viral-population diversity in all tissues, corresponding with high viral titers in all tissues. none of the marked viruses has a growth advantage or disadvantage in vivo. a YFV-17D population diversity assay was developed to identify host barriers that limit poliovirus trafficking in mice (7, 8); herein, we generated a similar assay to study YFV-17D dissemination and trafficking barriers. we created 6 marked YFV-17D viruses by incorporating silent mutations into the nonstructural 1 region of the YFV-17D genome. YFV-17D-infected mice inoculated with 6 103 PFU of YFV-17D viral-pool mixture. BL6-IFNAR+/+ mice did not exhibit signs of disease up to 30 days postinfection. at 7 to 8 days postinfection, 32% of the i.m.-inoculated BL6-IFNAR/ mice showed one of two distinct disease phenotypes. three- to four-week-old mice were injected i.m. with 6 103 PFU of the YFV-17D viral-pool mixture. disease onset was monitored. data are shown as percentages without disease. blot from an infected BL6-IFNAR/ mouse is shown in Fig. 3A. poliovirus encountered a major bottleneck between the inoculation site (muscle) and the brain in BL6-IFNAR+/+ mice. 60% of viral-pool members present in the brain at disease onset (7, 8) we quantified the number of YFV-17D pool members present in tissues of BL6-IFNAR/ mice with or without disease signs. a majority of the six marked viruses were present in muscle and brain of BL6-IFNAR/ mice regardless of whether the mice showed signs of disease. viral titers in the brain were highest at disease onset, although viral-population diversity was reduced. this suggests a dynamic interplay between viral replication and clearance in the brain. previous studies have found that arboviruses encounter population bottlenecks during dissemination in the mosquito vector. virulent strains of YFV caused disease in subcutaneously inoculated 129Sv[ev]-IFNAR/ mice. i.m. inoculation of YFV-17D caused disease in BL6-IFNAR/ mice. poliovirus encountered a bottleneck during trafficking from muscle to the brain. for poliovirus, titer and viral diversity were not linked, such that some high-titer sites (brain) had very low viral-population diversity, indicative of viral replication after a major bottleneck (7, 8) however, the presence of all six marked viruses in several tissues indicates that no major barrier limited trafficking of these marked pool members. model of YFV-17D population movement in i.m.-inoculated BL6-IFNAR/ mice. most of the six marked viruses were present in the inoculated tissue. viral titers and numbers of pool members present were low."}
