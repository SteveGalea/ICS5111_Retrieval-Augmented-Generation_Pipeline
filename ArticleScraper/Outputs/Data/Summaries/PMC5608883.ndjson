{"summary": "BAFF is synthesized as a membrane-bound form, which can be further processed to a soluble form by furin convertase cleavage. the ablation of BAFF activity by genetic deletion or by using blocking anti-BAFF antibodies results in the depletion of transitional type 2 (T2) B cells. peritoneal B1 cell numbers are not affected by BAFF deficiency. the decrease in B cell numbers is accompanied by a mild reduction in serum IgA levels and a severe decrease in IgG levels. in the absence of BAFF, the decrease in B cell numbers is accompanied by a mild reduction in serum IgA levels and a severe decrease in IgG levels. APRIL deficiency does not change serum IgG levels but results in lower levels of IgA. the only alteration in serum immunoglobulins in APRIL Tg mice is an elevation of IgM levels. BAFF-R (mBAFF-R) is shed by ADAM10 and ADAM17. activity of ADAM17 requires stimulation of B cells by 60-mer BAFF. mBCMA is processed by -secretase. human plasma cells and memory B cells express both TACI and BCMA. TACI is more pronounced on FO B cells and germinal center (GC) B cells. TACI is primarily expressed on MZ B cells, followed by FO B cells, memory B cells, and plasma cells (22, 30). soluble TACI antagonizes both BAFF and APRIL. soluble BCMA binds only to APRIL. processing requires BAFF stimulation and TACI coexpression. both human and mouse neonatal B cells express severely reduced levels of TACI (51\u201353), which appears to be due to weak B cell receptor signaling during the newborn period (50, 52) in human B cells, interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-10 can augment B cell receptor- and CD40-mediated TACI expression, although these cytokines do not alter TACI expression by themselves. s syndrome and hematological malignancies are areas that have benefitted most from research on BAFF system molecules. these studies led to approaches to ablate BAFF/APRIL activity as a treatment strategy. belimumab, an anti-BAFF antibody, was approved in 2011 by the FDA for the treatment of active SLE. FF-deficient mice manifest decreased numbers of CD44+ CD62L effector/memory T cells (9) Roles for BAFF system molecules in immunizationa Molecule Role(s) Method(s) of proof Reference(s) BAFF Mediating antibody response to TD and TI antigens Systemic and mucosal immunization of exptl animals with BAFF-containing vaccines 7. fected patients with influenza vaccine BCMA Contributing to long-term survival of antigen-specific bone marrow plasma cells Immunization of BCMA/ mice with a TD antigen 31 a TD, T cell dependent; TI, T cell independent; TI-II, TI type II; APRIL Tg, APRIL transgenic; CVID, combined variable immunodeficiency; XID, X-linked immunodeficient; Tfh, T follicular levels of IgA produced in normal mice intranasally immunized with pneumococcal surface protein A correlate with levels of BAFF and APRIL expressed by mucosal DCs. in vitro assessments showed that APRIL induces IgA class switching in naive B cells more efficiently than does BAFF (19, 71) however, there seems to be an overall redundancy between BAFF and APRIL in regulating humoral responses, but APRIL is more a subset of CVID patients has been shown to express various levels of TACI on B cells due to a heterozygous mutation in TNFRSF13B, the gene encoding TACI (78). patients with the lowest density of B cell TACI expression also have the lowest levels of serum antibodies compared to normal individuals. the requirement for TACI expression to maintain plasma cells also extends to responses against T cell-dependent (TD) antigens. the consequence of TACI deficiency is mostly detrimental to the survival of plasma cells after immunizations or infections. early studies suggested that TACI is dispensable for TD antibody responses (73, 75) however, by immunizing TACI-deficient mice with the TD antigen nitrophenyl-chicken gamma globulin (NP-CGG), Ou et al. recently reported that TACI is required for the survival of plasma cells specific for TD antigens. a series of DNA vaccines containing HIV envelope proteins has been tested in mice and rabbits. the systemic coadministration of BAFF with the TI vaccine Pneumovax23 resulted in significantly higher IgM and IgA antibodies without any enhancement of IgG antibody levels. a series of DNA vaccines containing HIV envelope proteins together with BAFF and/or APRIL trimers have been tested in mice and rabbits. studies suggest an association between elevated plasma BAFF and APRIL levels and hypergammaglobulinemia in HIV-infected individuals (95\u201399) dendritic cells, monocytes, and macrophages are the sources of increased BAFF and APRIL levels during HIV infection (97, 99, 101, 103) cells to gp120 in HIV infection may also be linked to changes in expression levels of BAFF and APRIL receptors. elevated TACI levels on CD21low B cells are a likely cause of augmented hypergammaglobulinemia, the most prominent B cell defect associated with HIV infection. infants 131 Cytomegalovirus and coronavirus Production by astrocytes and glial cells is increased 134\u2013136 RABV Production by splenic B cells is increased 138 BAFF-R HIV Expression is decreased on B cells 110 VSV and LCMV Higher susceptibility in BAFF-R/ mice due to loss of CD169+ macrophages 124, 126, 127 TACI HIV Expression is increased on B cells 110 Influenza virus Short-lived bacterial polysaccharides from group C meningococcus and group B streptococcus type V have been shown to downregulate the expression of BAFF-R on B cells. BAFF-R levels on B cells are reduced in HIV-infected patients. hepatitis c virus (HCV) infection manifests as pathogenic B cell lymphoproliferation. elevated serum autoantibody levels are likely responsible for the appearance of autoantibodies in these patients. elevated serum BAFF levels are also increased in chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. asymptomatic HBV carriers have the lowest and hepatocellular carcinoma patients have the highest levels of serum BAFF (120) 169+ macrophages located in the subcapsular sinus and in the medulla of lymph nodes (125) as CD169+ macrophages also activate B cells located in the underlying follicles, host susceptibility is amplified with the loss of BAFF-R (126, 127). a consequence of an arrest in mature B cell survival in BAFF-R-deficient mice is the loss of a link between innate and adaptive immune systems during VSV and LC both BAFF and APRIL have been implicated in RSV infection. a positive correlation between BAFF and APRIL levels in nasopharyngeal secretions of RSV-infected infants and levels of antiviral IgA and IgM antibodies. cytomegalovirus- and coronavirus-induced BAFF and APRIL are implicated in host resistance because they help maintain virus-specific plasma cells through TACI and BCMA in the central nervous system. cytomegalovirus increases human tonsillar B cell survival by stimulating the expression of BAFF and BAFF-R on these cells. negative factor (Nef) (105), gp120 (106), and indirectly by type I interferon (IFN) secreted from plasmacytoid DCs in response to viral particles (107, 108) the role for gp120 in HIV infection is especially interesting because this glycoprotein stimulates BAFF and APRIL expression in monocytes and engages human tonsillar IgD+ B cells. ulinemia is the most prominent B cell defect associated with HIV infection. CD21 is one of the markers defining MZ B cells as CD21hi (101) mice 87 BCMA HIV Expression is increased on B cells 110 a HCV, hepatitis C virus; HBV, hepatitis B virus; RSV, respiratory syncytial virus; RABV, rabies virus; LCMV, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus; HCMV, human cytomegalovirus. many pathogens induce expression of BAFF and APRIL in myeloid cells or epithelial cells bacterial polysaccharides from group C meningococcus and group B streptococcus type V have been shown to downregulate the expression of BAFF-R on B cells. BAFF-R levels on B cells are reduced in HIV-infected patients. in vivo factors responsible for diminished BAFF-R expression are unknown. elevated BAFF-mediated B cell activation is implicated in autoantibody production in autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (8). the expansion of BAFF-sensitive and apoptosis-resistant CD5+ B cells is likely responsible for the appearance of autoantibodies. zoonotic Viruses vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) are used as models to study host responses to viral infections. susceptibility of BAFF-R-deficient mice to viral infection appears to be an indirect consequence of mature B cell loss. in TACI-deficient mice with influenza virus is the loss of a link between innate and adaptive immune systems during VSV and LCMV infections. both BAFF and APRIL have been implicated in RSV infection because epithelial cells isolated from infants with fatal RSV infection express BAFF and APRIL, which are colocalized with cells expressing type I IFN. RSV-induced type I IFN is likely responsible for elevated BAFF and APRIL levels because RSV induces the potent BAFF- and APRIL-stimulating cytokine IFN- through TLR3 (132). also, the type I IFN-mediated induction of BAFF from RSV-infected epithelial cells was confirmed by McNamara et al. using cultured airway epithelial cells (133). cytomegalovirus also increases human tonsillar B cell survival by stimulating the expression of BAFF and BAFF-R on these cells. immunization with a recombinant rabies vaccine expressing APRIL does not improve antibody responses. increased levels of serum BAFF and APRIL appear to correlate with disease severity. the importance of elevated BAFF and APRIL levels in M. tuberculosis pathogenesis has not been investigated. the significance of anti-M. tuberculosis antibodies remains controversial. TACI C. rodentium infected TACI/ mice show increased susceptibility 154\u2013156 TACI C. rodentium Infected TACI/ mice show enhanced GC reaction and bacterial clearance 149 S. pneumoniae TACI/ mice do not develop anticapsular antibodies 157 Meningococcal type C, group B Streptococcus serotype V. heat-killed P. aeruginosa is coadministered with an adenovirus expressing full-length BAFF. mice are better protected against lethal respiratory P. aeruginosa challenge and mount higher levels of antibodies in sera and lungs. poor plasma cell survival in response to NP-CGG immunization (85) and increased susceptibility to influenza virus challenge remain unknown. a role for BAFF in the development of TI responses to the tick-borne intracellular pathogen Ehrlichia muris has been shown in a murine infection model. challenge of BAFF-R-deficient mice, but not TACI-deficient mice, results in impairment of B. hermsii clearance. TACI expression is required for the development of antibodies against the capsular polysaccharide after injection with heat-killed Streptococcus pneumoniae (157) increased levels of serum BAFF and APRIL appear to correlate with disease severity in mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected patients. increased expression levels of both cytokines in CD4+ cells of patients with active M. tuberculosis infection. increased BAFF and APRIL levels may promote antibody development in M. tuberculosis-infected hosts, but the significance of anti-M. tuberculosis antibodies remains controversial. further research is needed to unveil whether BAFF- and APRIL-induced M1 polarization of macrophages impacts disease outcomes of M. tuberculosis infection. TACI/ mice immunized with heat-killed S. pneumoniae do not develop anticapsular antibodies 157 Meningococcal type C, group B Streptococcus serotype V The capsular polysaccharides downregulate TACI expression on B cells, causing B cell unresponsiveness to BAFF and APRIL 76 a Th1, type 1 T helper. eruginosa is coadministered with an adenovirus expressing full-length BAFF. mice are better protected against lethal respiratory P. aeruginosa challenge and mount higher levels of antibodies in sera and lungs than animals immunized with heat-killed P. aeruginosa alone. an elevated level of BAFF has been shown in a murine infection model. the model is known to be controlled by IgM-producing CD138high IgMhigh plasma cells (151, 152) this study showed that the systemic ablation of BAFF with a neutralizing antibody halts the terminal differentiation of bacterium-specific IgM-secreting plasmablasts and renders mice more susceptible to infection. infections by Encapsulated Bacteria Similar to findings with purified polysaccharides (52, 73), TACI expression is required for the development of antibodies against the capsular polysaccharide after injection with heat-killed Streptococcus pneumoniae (157) this diminished antibody response in TACI-deficient mice results in greater susceptibility to subsequent pneumococcal challenge than in the S. pneumoniae-immunized 157. PARASITES Leishmaniasis and Chagas' Disease BAFF and B cell responses are important for resisting diseases caused by protozoan parasites (161) but increased expression levels of BAFF and APRIL can also lead to dysregulated B cell responses and susceptibility to parasites. in visceral leishmaniasis, polyclonal B cell activation and hypergammaglobulinemia are associated with APRIL and BAFF expression in the spleens of in ic BAFF ablation experiments verified the role of BAFF as the cause of polyclonal B cell activation. BAFF ablation does not change the systemic parasite burden but results in elevated parasite counts in the heart. authors suggested that the reduction in B cell numbers is a plausible cause of localized parasite replication in the heart. 185 APRIL P. falciparum Level is increased in placental samples of cases of placental malaria 178 BAFF-R P. falciparum Expression on peripheral B cells of children during acute malarial infection 179 T. brucei Expression is reduced, leading to loss of parasite-specific IgM+ B cells 169 TACI L. major TACI/ mice are more susceptible to cutaneous Leishmania because of M2-skewed phenotype of macrophage trypanosoma brucei induces a rapid TI antibody response that suppresses the parasite load during the early phase of infection. however, experimentally infected mice succumb to infection partially because of the parasite-driven apoptosis of MZ B cells. this is likely mediated by a reduction in BAFF-R expression and subsequent downregulation of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein in infected murine MZ B cells. schizont fraction and hemozoin stimulate BAFF-R expression on B cells. expression levels of both mRNAs in malaria-infected patients have also been reported. high plasma BAFF levels and elevated TACI and BCMA expression levels are also observed in human subjects. despite the presence of circulating BAFF in malaria, ASCs may not be receiving sufficient survival signals. despite the presence of circulating BAFF in malaria, TACI signaling is activated only by oligomeric BAFF and membrane-bound BAFF (46) the significance of BAFF in infected humans is not as clear as animal models suggest. mice infected with trypanosoma cruzi exhibit elevated levels of serum BAFF, but a correlation with serum IgG levels was not found. the authors of that study suggested that the reduction in B cell numbers is a plausible cause of localized parasite replication in the heart. an alternative explanation may be related to the polarizing effect of BAFF on macrophages, since both BAFF and APRIL drive TACI signaling (56) TACI L. major TACI/ mice are more susceptible to cutaneous Leishmania because of. M2-skewed phenotype of macrophages 56 P. falciparum Expression is elevated on peripheral B cells. of children during acute malarial infection 179 BCMA P. falciparum Expression is elevated on peripheral B cells of children. mice lose parasite-specific IgM+ B cells and are impaired in mounting a humoral immune response to unrelated pathogens and vaccines. malaria infection is accompanied by hypergammaglobulinemia, a consequence of parasite-induced polyclonal B cell activation. the expression levels of both mRNAs are significantly increased in placental malaria (PM)-positive placenta samples. increased levels of BAFF, IgG, and IgM are positively correlated with increased placental malarial pigment deposition (a pathological feature of chronic PM) (178) children have high plasma BAFF levels and elevated B cell TACI and BCMA expression levels. experimentally infected individuals exhibit increased BAFF expression levels on inflammatory monocytes as well as on blood DCs during acute human malaria. the differences in membrane-bound BAFF expression between human and murine studies can be partly explained by the fact that human BAFF expression was measured on blood myeloid cells. however, it is not clear why membrane-bound BAFF expression on blood myeloid cells does not provide sufficient survival signals. induction of anti-C. neoformans antibodies from PBMCs with BAFF inhibits C. neoformans growth. microbial products can modulate the expression of BAFF and APRIL receptors. pathogens may have evolved to exploit BAFF system molecules. the increase in expression levels of BAFF system molecules does not necessarily benefit the host. a central role for TACI in mediating the essential second signal for B cell responses to TI-II antigens makes it attractive target for encapsulated bacteria. soluble forms of TACI and BCMA receptors appear to function as decoy receptors for BAFF and APRIL (43, 44) the shedding of BAFF-R deprives B cells of survival signals (45) the biological significance of these recently described soluble receptors in infections has not been demonstrated. macrophage responses directly impact the magnitude and quality of T cell responses. modulation of TACI-mediated signals may have implications for macrophage antigen presentation functions."}
