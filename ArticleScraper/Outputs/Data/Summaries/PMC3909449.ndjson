{"summary": "the modern era of CHMIs began in the mid 1980s when laboratory reared anopheles sp. mosquitoes were infected by feeding on cultures of Plasmodium falciparum-infected blood. the most commonly reported symptoms are headache, fever, myalgia and fatigue. the most commonly reported symptoms are headache, fever, myalgia and fatigue. volunteers taking aseptic purified, cryopreserved PfSPZ (PfSPZ Challenge) were injected intradermally at four-week intervals with PfSPZ-CVac approach (=PfSPZ Chemoprophylaxis Vaccine), and then underwent CHMI. a very probable case of acute myocarditis is described in a volunteer who had taken chloroquine chemoprophylaxis, was inoculated three times at physical examination was within normal limits with a blood pressure of 139/76 mmHg, heart rate of 55 beats per minute and a body mass index of 20.2 kg/m2. standard laboratory tests at inclusion were normal (see Additional file 1). 3.7 \u2013 5.0 3.8 4.0 3.8 Creatinine (mol/L) 60 \u2013 132 87 82 74 83 80 76 75 Urea nitrogen (mmol/L) 2.5 \u2013 8.1 5.1 4.6 5.8 Alkaline phosphatase (U/L) 126 66 82 84 76 77 76 Aspartate aminotransferase (U/L) 38 16 49 81 66 41 32 Alanine aminotransfer no clinically significant laboratory abnormalities were found during the immunization period. he underwent CHMI by the bites of five P. falciparum-infected mosquitoes. on day 9 post-CHMI he complained of a sore throat. the troponin T was 197 ng/L in the morning and 299 ng/L in the afternoon. the blood pressure was 114/60 mmHg and the ECG revealed mild repolarization disturbances. the echocardiogram showed mild hypokinesia of the inferior wall and a slightly diminished global left ventricle (LV)-function. treatment was started on day 14 post-CHMI with a beta-blocker, metoprolol (25 mg twice daily), to reduce the chance of cardiac arrhythmia and according to the treatment guidelines for patients with reduced LV-function. the findings were interpreted as indicative of myocarditis. a biochemical marker of cardiac wall stress, NT-proBNP, was slightly elevated on days 15 and 17 post-CHMI, but was normal on day 20 post-CHMI. a limited rise and fall of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were found. the nonspecific marker for increased coagulation and inflammation, D-dimer, remained within the normal range. eces and whole blood were carried out for viruses and bacteria known to cause myocarditis. virological, bacteriological and parasitological serology was performed on samples obtained three weeks before inclusion. urine toxicology screening for amphetamine-derivatives, cocaine, cannabinoids, diazepam, methadone, tramadol hydrochloride, and opiates was negative on day 17 after CHMI. serology results for known infectious pathogens of myocarditis based on samples taken at the screening visit, on day 17 and 35 after CHMI (C + 17 and C + 35, respectively) serologic analysis was repeated on day C + 35 for a number of pathogens. paired serologic analysis was performed with serum drawn on day C + 17. oedema had disappeared completely and concomitantly delayed enhancement decreased. clinically suspected acute myocarditis with typical MRI characteristics is reported in a healthy volunteer participating in a PfSPZ-CVac approach phase 1 clinical trial. the first myocarditis manifestations occurred 71 days after the last dose of PfSPZ Challenge, 44 days after the last dose of chloroquine, 57 and 31 days after receiving pre-travel vaccines. improved myocardial function, disappearance of oedema and reduced delayed enhancement after almost five months correspond troponin T was very rarely (0.6%) elevated when assessed retrospectively in patients with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria [24]. Previously, a cardiac serious adverse event was reported in a female volunteer who participated in a phase 1 clinical trial in which she was immunized with a subunit, recombinant protein malaria vaccine (PfLSA3). the most common cause of acute myocarditis in a healthy young individual is a viral infection. Enteroviridae (including Coxsackie B) were responsible for 25 \u2013 30% of cases in the past [31], but other viruses (including adenovirus, parvovirus B19, and hepatitis C) have also emerged as important cardiotropic pathogens. no systemic allergic reactions or local adverse events have occurred in the 20 volunteers who have received three intradermal injections of 7.5 104 PfSPZ of PfSPZ Challenge. there have been no systemic allergic reactions among the 184 subjects who have received single doses of PfSPZ Challenge by the ID routes. the volunteer denied excessive use of alcohol, and urine drug tests for cocaine, amphetamines and cannabinoids were negative, making such factors an unlikely explanation. there are different possible causes for the myocarditis but a definitive cause in this case cannot be established.
