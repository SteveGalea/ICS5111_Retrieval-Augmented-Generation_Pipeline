{"summary": "enhanced surveillance was introduced to include healthcare facilities in ziyang and the 5 surrounding prefectures. we ordered all healthcare facilities to immediately report all new patients with clinical sepsis, meningitis, arthritis, or endocarditis and fever >37.3\u00b0C. a probable case of S. suis infection was a compatible clinical illness. the figures on suspected meningitis cases could reflect nonmeningococcal meningitis caused by other bacteria, including S. suis. PCR products were purified by using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) bacterial isolates grown overnight on brain-heart infusion blood agar. template preparation, restriction enzyme digestion, gel electrophoresis and Southern hybridization were carried out with the RiboPrinter system. Statistical analysis Percentage, proportion, and case-fatality ratios were calculated. a probable case of S. suis infection was a compatible clinical illness (sepsis, meningitis, arthritis, or endocarditis) a confirmed case was defined as a compatible clinical illness regardless of exposure. notification statistics on suspected meningococcal meningitis were reviewed. polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to characterize selected genes of S. suis serotype 2. PCR products were purified by using the QIAquick PCR purification kit. sequenced with an ABI Prism 3700 DNA instrument. the first case-patient was a 52-year-old farmer from Yanjiang district of Ziyang Prefecture. he slaughtered a goat that had died of an unknown cause, fever (38.2\u00b0C), chills, abdominal pain, vomiting, generalized aching, and generalized purpura. ten hours later, he died on the way to the hospital. cases of S. suis infection predominantly involved adult male farmers with recent exposure to sick pigs or carcasses of pigs that had died of unknown illnesses. forty-eight percent of case-patients had wounds on their hands at the time of slaughter or carcass preparation. none of the 417 healthcare workers who cared for case-patients became infected. the residences of S. suis case-patients were widely distributed in 203 villages of 12 prefectures in Sichuan Province. in 194 villages, only 1 case was identified. in ziyang, Yibin, and Chengdu, 2 case-patients in 1 village each were identified. patients with STSS had a 62% case-fatality ratio compared to 0.6% for other clinical forms of streptococcal infections. Fatal STSS cases progressed from onset to death in a median of 25 hours (range 8 hours to 10.5 days) the median interval between exposure and onset was 2.2 days (range 3 hours to 14 days) the patients with STSS had a shorter incubation period and a higher frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms, coma, and petechiae and ecchymoses than did other patients. eight percent of non-STSS cases had petechiae or ecchymoses, and 9% had hypotension. brudzinski positive 2 (3) 17 (11) 19 (9) Hypotension (blood pressure 90 mm Hg) 25 (93) 2 (9) 27 (55) *STSS, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. not conducted in every patient. postmortem examination of 4 STSS patients showed features of disseminated intravascular coagulation. evidence of multiple organ damage was observed, primarily involving kidneys, adrenal glands, lungs, liver, pancreas, and heart. Isolates from 66 patients and 3 diseased pigs featured pure growth of tiny -hemolytic colonies on sheep blood agar. the colony shape and biochemical reactions by Vitek2 compact and API-Strep were all compatible with that of S. suis. PCR on all isolates showed gene coding for tuf, species-specific 16S rRNA of S. suis. the decline coincided with new measures that prohibited domestic slaughter of sick pigs or pigs that died of any illness. the last case-patient had onset of illness on august 4. by august 18, two weeks after the date of onset of the last case, we had identified 215 cases. 149 cases, n = 66 Total, N = 215 Demographic features Male (%) 120 (81) 60 (91) 180 (84) Median age, y (range) 54 (26\u201382) 57 (33\u201381) 54 (26\u201382) Farmer (%) 145 (97) 62 (94) 207 (96) Exposure history 7 days before onset of symptom, no. 215 Streptococcus suis patients were previously healthy adults. 28% had sepsis characterized by acute onset of fever, chills, headaches, dizziness, malaise, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. 48% had meningitis characterized by headache, stiff neck, and other signs of acute meningitis. we determined exposure and onset times for 63 of the 66 laboratory-confirmed cases. of the 215 cases, we could determine exposure time and onset times for 203. eight percent of non-STSS cases had petechiae or ecchymoses, and 9% had hypotension. CSF abnormalities compatible with purulent meningitis were found in 31 (40%) of 77 patients who had a lumbar puncture. symptoms and signs STSS, no. (%) (n = 61) Non-STSS, no. (%) n = 154) Total, no.
