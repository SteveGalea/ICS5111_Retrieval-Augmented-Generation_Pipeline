{"summary": "pig enteric viruses such as transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), rotavirus, astrovirus (PAstV), sapovirus (PSaV), kobuvirus and other agents are essential to evaluate the risks to animal health. the presence of PAstV and PSaV was studied in 411 rectal swabs collected from healthy and diarrheic pigs. genetic diversity of PAstV was very high as all five lineages were identified in pig farms in Slovakia. all five lineages were genetically related to the strains circulating in central European region."}{"summary": "pig enteric viruses such as transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), rotavirus, astrovirus (PAstV), sapovirus (PSaV), kobuvirus and other agents are essential to evaluate the risks to animal health. the presence of PAstV and PSaV was studied in 411 rectal swabs collected from healthy and diarrheic pigs. genetic diversity of PAstV was very high as all five lineages were identified in pig farms in Slovakia. all five lineages were genetically related to the strains circulating in central European region."}
