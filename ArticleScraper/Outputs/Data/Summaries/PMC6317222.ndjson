{"summary": "in the healthcare environment, microorganisms can easily spread from resident to resident. direct contact between people is the most obvious factor of microbial cross-contamination. a contamination on a primary surface can somehow very quickly spread across an entire service or care unit. copper surface kills a wide range of bacterial, viral, and fungal species. the key of copper antimicrobial activity is ions releasing from the surface. ions will then induce damages to bacterial cell wall and membranes, production of reactive oxygen species, and degradation of DNA. each facility employs its own staff and uses its own protocol for disinfection and cleaning. the sampling series were conducted over an 18 months period and executed with at least one week of delay between them. a APESIN Clean Bacto b D10.1 c Helispray A d or water on copper surfaces Aniosurf e Surface disinfection frequency 1/day 1/day 1/day 1/day 1/day 1/day 1/day 1/day Copper installation date

applied gently on all the surface of the handle to remove non-adherent particles if any. bacterial pellet was resuspended in peptone water to reach a concentration of 1010 CFU/mL. sterile swab was

of the same sequence. each door handle or handrail was sampled using a sterile silicon template and a sterile swab. the swab was moistened in sterile peptone water and was applied five times longitudinally and 15 times transversally. samples were stored at 4 \u00b0C during transport to the laboratory. used door handles were collected from five facilities approximately one year (beginning of the in situ study) or three years (end of the in situ study) after set-up in the long-term care facilities. no drastic physical or chemical treatments were performed on their surface before the in vitro tests. a single colony was resuspended in 25 mL of TSB and incubated at 37 \u00b0C. after three washes with 10 mL peptone water and centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in peptone water to reach a concentration of 1010 CFU/mL. sterile swab was moistened with 50 L of peptone water and was applied gently on all the surface of the handle to remove non-adherent particles if any. glass slides were used as control surfaces. a single colony was resuspended in 25 mL of TSB and incubated at 37 \u00b0C over night. 2 mL of the culture were added to 50 mL of TSB, and incubated at 37 \u00b0C, stirring at 250 rpm, during four hours. bacterial pellet was resuspended in peptone water to reach 1010 CFU/mL. a p-value 0.05 was considered statistically significant (two-sided) for every test, a p-value 0.05 was considered statistically significant. a total of 688 copper surfaces and 688 control surfaces were sampled. three copper door handles (1%) vs. 14 control door handles (4%) and three copper handrails (1%) vs. six control handrails (2%) were found in each long-term care facility. surface contamination was different from one establishment to another. in each long-term care facility and for both sequences, the median bacterial burden was lower on copper door handles. the median bacterial burden on handrail was once again systematically lower on copper, except for one series for C and D. the three years used copper handles a 1.7 (1.1) log reduction average. the tested surfaces were stainless steel, and copper door handles after different times of use in long-term care facilities. a total of 688 copper surfaces and 688 control surfaces were sampled. extreme contaminations, defined as sample presenting 100 CFU/cm2, have been observed but occurred significantly less frequently on copper surfaces. the differences between copper and control median burdens were significant in every establishment and for both door handle and handrail. terial burden recovered from (a) door handles and (b) handrails in each long-term care facility (A to E) black bars, control; white bars, copper. 65 n 70. Median values. 3.3. persistence over time of the mean antibacterial activity was analysed. unused copper door handles showed an average 3.2 (0.6) log reduction compared to glass. one year used copper handles showed a 2.7 (0.7) log reduction average. the three years used copper handles a 1.7 (1.1) log reduction average. the median contaminations levels observed were always lower on copper surfaces than on control surfaces. the estimate average bacterial burden reduction on copper was 59% for door handles and 33% for handrails. the differences in sampling protocols may induce performance variations in the bacterial recovery. copper alloys compositions are probably very different from one study to another. the cleaning protocols remained unchanged after the copper surfaces set-up in four of the five long-term care facilities. the regular use of disinfectants can somehow modify the copper surface and lead to a loss of the surface antibacterial activity. the values of bacterial burden were very variable between the establishments and inside each establishment, ranging from 1 CFU/cm2 to >2000 CFU/cm2. copper surfaces are less subject to these extreme contaminations, this frequency being reduced by 50% on copper handrail and by 79% on door handles. the average reductions of bacterial burden, as well as the 4,6 times decrease of high contaminations (>20 CFU/cm2) suggest that door handles display a stronger antibacterial activity than handrail copper surfaces maintained their antibacterial activity against the pathogen. this was observed in the five establishments, one year and three years after copper set-up, for both door handle and handrails. copper surfaces maintain their activity against this pathogen, with a reduction superior to 90%. working on the aging of the copper surface could bring new insight to further increase the antimicrobial activity of copper alloys."}
