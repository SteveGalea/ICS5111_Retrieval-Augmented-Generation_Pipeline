{"summary": "human embryonic kidney (HEK 293T and HeLa cells express multiple isoforms of STAU2 and STAU1 (1, 13, 20) dsRBDs 3 and 4 have retained the ability to bind dsRNA. dsRBDs 3 and 4 have retained the ability to bind dsRNA and are 78% and 81% identical, respectively (2). the level of each FLUC mRNA was normalized to the level of its pre-mRNA. the level of cellular GAP43 mRNA was normalized to the level of its pre-mRNA. the level of cellular GAP43 mRNA was normalized to the level of its pre-mRNA. RT-PCR revealed that STAU1 and STAU2 siRNAs augmented the level of each SMD reporter mRNA two- to threefold. STAU2 siRNA, like STAU1 siRNA, up-regulated the level of endogenous mRNA harboring a 3\u2032 UTR SBS. extracts of HeLa cells that stably express FLAG-UPF1 at twofold the level of cellular UPF1 (23) were immunoprecipitated in the presence or absence of RNase A. compared with STAU1 isoforms, the co-IP efficiency of each STAU2 isoform was 10-fold more resistant to RNase A. AG-UPF1 (8 107 per 150-mm dish) were lysed and analyzed before () or after IP using anti()-FLAG or, as a negative control, mouse (m)IgG in the absence of RNase A. the left-most four lanes show threefold dilutions of protein. FLAG-UPF1 pulled down 10-fold more GST-STAU262 and GST-STAU259 compared with GST-STAU155. the co-IP of STAU2 with FLAG-UPF1 is less sensitive to RNase A than the co-IP of STAU1 with FLAG-UPF1 with FLAG-UPF1. GST-STAU155 (100 nM) was incubated with 100 nM of HIS-STAU155, STAU262-HIS, STAU259-HIS or, as a negative control, BSA. left-most four lanes are threefold dilutions of GST-STAU155 and BSA. HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with 5 g of pCI-neo-HA3 or pCI-neo-STAU262-HA3 in the absence or presence of RNase A. the level of each coimmunoprecipitated STAU1 isoform in the absence of RNase A was defined as 100. STAU2 and STAU2 have been reported to bind distinct but overlapping subsets of mRNAs in HEK293T cells. the pcFLUC SMD-reporter plasmids were transfected with a pCI-neo-STAU155-HA3, pCI-neo-STAU262-HA3 effector plasmid together with four of the pcFLUC plasmids. lysates from formaldehyde-treated cells were immunoprecipitated using anti-HA. STAU155-HA3, STAU262-HA3 and STAU259-HA3 coimmunoprecipitate with mRNAs two- to fivefold more efficiently than does STAU155-HA3. the four left-most lanes show threefold dilutions of lysates from cells that expressed STAU259-HA3. for samples before IP, the level of each FLUC mRNA was normalized to its normalized level before IP. RT-qPCR measurements of the level of E. coli LacZ mRNA confirmed comparable RNA recovery efficiencies. coat protein binding sequence (MS2bs) encodes a tetherable protein. pcFLUC, pcFLUC, pcFLUC, phCMV-MUP and pMS2-HA-STAU155 encode a tetherable protein. pMS2-HA-STAU155, pMS2-HA-STAU262, or pMS2-HA-STAU259 encode a tetherable protein. 0.1 g of pcFLUC-MS2bs, 0.1 g of a plasmid that produces RLUC protein (pRLUC), and 1 g of the specified effector plasmid. after an additional 2 d, protein and RNA were purified. RT-qPCR was used to quantitate the extent of down-regulation. STAU1 siRNA inhibited the ability of tethered STAU155R, STAU262R, or STAU259R to reduce mRNA abundance. neither STAU2 nor STAU1 can effectively trigger SMD when the level of cellular STAU2, STAU1 is reduced. STAU155, STAU262, and STAU259 activate SMD by augmenting UPF1 helicase activity but not UPF1 ATPase activity. assays used 1 Ci of -[32P]ATP and 4 g of poly(U) the four left-most lanes show threefold dilutions of lysates from cells that expressed MYC-UPF1. the level of each FLUC mRNA was normalized to the level of RLUC mRNA. the normalized level of each in pCMV-MYC-transfected cells was defined as 100. helicase assays were performed in the presence of ATP, 2 mM of ATP+10 mM of NaVO3 or 10 mM of NaVO3. helicase assays were performed in the presence of ATP, 5\u2032-adenylyl,-imidodiphosphate (ADPNP), which mimics the ground state of the ATP hydrolysis reaction (32, 34); ATP together with NaVO3. VO3 replaces Pi after ATP hydrolysis to form ADP-VO3 at the active site and inhibit further hydrolysis (35\u201337); ADP; or no nucleotide. helicase activity is driven by the energy released from ATP cleavage and/or a resulting cleavage-dependent change in UPF1 conformation. STAU1 or STAU2 did not enhance UPF1 helicase activity in the absence of ATP (Fig. 6 I and J and Fig. S3 G and H) and also failed to activate UPF1(G495R,G497E) helicase activity. results from our ATPase assays demonstrating that STAU paralog-mediated enhancement of UPF1 unwinding is not accompanied by an increase in the number of ATP hydrolytic events. STAU262 binding to UPF1 shifts the length of RNA protected by UPF1 from 11 to 12 nt to 12 to 13 nt. in the absence of STAU262, ADPNP, ADP-AlF4 or ADP-VO3 binding to UPF1 increased the length of RNA protected to 12\u201314 nt. we propose that STAU262 alters the conformation of UPF1 so that it protects a length of RNA between the length STAU262 expands the UPF1 footprint on ssRNA. the specified complexes were formed using 5 pmol of in vitro-transcribed -[32P]UTP-labeled 60-nt RNA; 10 pmol of UPF1; 40 pmol of STAU262; and where specified 2 mM of the indicated nucleotide. ATP-free UPF1 protects a smaller (11- to 12-nt) region of RNA than does ATP-bound UPF1. footprint of ATP-bound UPF1 consists of as many as 14 nt and is maintained during the process of ATP hydrolysis and RNA unwinding. dsRBD5, the full-length of which is unique to STAU1 (21) have been implicated in the formation of STAU1 homodimers and homomultimers in complex with RNA. diagrams of human STAU1 and STAU2 isoforms, where boxes represent functional and/or structural domains. STAU2 and STAU1 were down-regulated to the same extent in HeLa cells. phCMV-MUP produces major urinary protein (MUP) mRNA driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter. pcFLUC SMD-reporter plasmids encode firefly luciferase mRNAs. RT-PCR revealed that STAU1 and STAU2 siRNAs augmented the level of each SMD reporter mRNA two- to threefold. STAU2 siRNA, like STAU1, up-regulated the level of endogenous GAP43 mRNA and reduced the half-life of mRNA harboring a 3\u2032 UTR SBS (Fig. S1 G\u2013I) AU1 or STAU2 coimmunoprecipitated with FLAG-UPF1. co-IP efficiency of each STAU2 isoform was 10-fold more resistant to RNase A. cellular suppressor with morphogenetic effect on genitalia protein 7 (SMG7) mRNA was detectable in the absence but not the presence of RNase A. the level of each coimmunoprecipitated STAU protein in the absence of RNase A was defined as 100. the left-most six lanes represent twofold dilutions of RNA. the left-most four lanes show threefold dilutions of protein. STAU2 and STAU1 Paralogs Self-Associate and Associate with One Another failed to pull down GST-PABPC1. GST-STAU155 pulled down GST-STAU155, STAU262-HIS and STAU259-HIS with comparable efficiencies. HEK293T cells (4 107 per 150-mm dish) were transiently transfected with 10 g of pSTAU155-HA3, lysed, and analyzed before or after IP using anti()-HA. the six left-most lanes represent twofold serial dilutions of RNA. mmunoprecipitated STAU1 isoform in the absence of RNase A was defined as 100. hek293T cells were transiently transfected with a STAU155-HA3 expression vector. STAU155-HA3 indeed coimmunoprecipitated with cellular STAU155, STAU262, STAU259, and STAU252 in the absence or presence of RNase A. STAU1 and STAU2 have been reported to bind distinct but overlapping subsets of mRNAs in HEK293T cells. we then determined whether STAU2 coimmunoprecipitates with RNA sequences that are known to bind STAU1 and trigger SMD (13, 14, 16) STAU262-HA3 and STAU259-HA3 coimmunoprecipitate with known SBS-containing targets more efficiently than does STAU155-HA3. lysates from formaldehyde-treated cells were immunoprecipitated using anti-HA. the level of each immunoprecipitated FLUC mRNA was normalized to its normalized level before IP. after IP, samples were spiked with a small amount of E. coli RNA. RT-PCR measurements of the level of E. coli LacZ mRNA confirmed comparable RNA recovery efficiencies. tethering MS2-HA-STAU155, MS2-HA-STAU262 or MS2-HA-STAU259 to the FLUC-MS2bs mRNA 3\u2032 UTR triggers FLUC-MS2bs mRNA SMD in a mechanism that depends on the cellular STAU paralogs and cellular UPF1. additional 2 d, protein and RNA were purified. RT-qPCR was used to quantitate the effects of tethering of the specified protein on FLUC-MS2bs mRNA abundance. expression of each tetherable protein reduced the abundance of FLUC-MS2bs reporter mRNA but not control FLUC mRNA to 40\u201350% of normal. STAU1 and STAU2 bind to a region of UPF1 that contains the CH domain. ATPase activity assays were performed in the presence of -[32P]ATP. STAU155, STAU262, and STAU259 activate SMD by augmenting helicase. RNA-dependent ATPase assays used 10 nM of UPF1 or UPF1(G495R,G497E) the activity of UPF1 was defined as 100. pCMV-MYC-transfected cells were defined as 100. as in B, using 0 (), 10, 20, or 40 nM (wedge) of UPF1 in the absence of nucleotide (ATP) or in the presence of 0.5 mM of ATP, ADPNP, ADP-BeF3, or ADP, or 0.5 mM of ATP together with (+) 2.5 mM of NaVO3. HEK293T cells were transfected with a MYC-UPF1 or MYC-UPF1 expression vector (29) and a subset of the pcFLUC SMD-reporter plasmids. helicase assays were performed in the presence of ATP; 5\u2032-adenylyl,-imidodiphosphate (ADPNP), which mimics the ground state of the ATP hydrolysis reaction. STAU1 and STAU2 did not enhance UPF1 helicase activity in the absence of ATP. helicase activity is driven by the energy released from ATP cleavage and/or a resulting cleavage-dependent change in UPF1 conformation. results from our ATPase assays showed that STAU1 or STAU2 did not enhance UPF1 helicase activity in the absence of ATP. the number of ATP hydrolytic events predicts that limiting ATP hydrolysis using NaVO3 would not inhibit the effect of STAU155 on UPF1 unwinding. we propose that STAU1 and possibly STAU2 promotes UPF1 helicase activity by inducing and/or stabilizing a helicase-active conformation. we examined STAU262 because of its higher binding in vitro to UPF1 relative to STAU155 or STAU259. DP-AlF4 or ADP-VO3 binding to UPF1 increased the length of RNA protected to 12\u201314 nt. we propose that STAU262 alters the conformation of UPF1 so that it protects a length of RNA between the length protected by ATP-free UPF1 and ATP (or an ATP-hydrolysis intermediate)-bound UPF1. samples were incubated with 1 g of RNase A and 1 U of RNase T1. sizes assigned to protected RNA fragments were determined using denaturing gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. tethering STAU2 downstream of the termination codon reduces reporter mRNA abundance in HEK293T cells in a mechanism that depends on UPF1, STAU1 and STAU2. tethering STAU2 downstream of the termination codon reduces reporter mRNA abundance in HEK293T cells. dsRBD2 and dsRBD5 are conserved in all STAU2 isoforms. binding of STAU2 to SBS-containing mRNAs is two- to fivefold higher. dsRBD3 and dsRBD4 seem to be the only functional dsRNA binding domains. individual dsRBDs that do not bind dsRNA in vitro can promote dsRNA binding of a \u201ctrue\u201d dsRBD when both reside in tandem. deletion analyses indicate that STAU1 (16) and STAU2 (15) interact with a region of UPF1 that includes the CH domain. this is the same region of UPF1 that interacts with UPF1 during NMD. there are two key differences between how STAU2 and STAU1 activate UPF1 during SMD. first, UPF2 stimulates UPF1 ATPase activity, whereas STAU paralogs do not. at least for STAU262, activation of UPF1 helicase activity is achieved by increasing rather than decreasing the size of the footprint on RNA. STAU262 binding to UPF1 may mimic nucleotide binding. the processivity of UPF1 is augmented by its binding to one or both STAU cofactors. other examples of cofactor-mediated helicase activation seem to bypass ATPase stimulation. tethering STAU2 downstream of the termination codon reduces reporter mRNA abundance in HEK293T cells. the efficiency of SMD in tethering assays and assays of cellular targets is determined by the abundance of both STAU1 and STAU2. dsRBD2 and parts of STAU1 dsRBD5 are conserved in all STAU2 isoforms. binding of STAU2 to SBS-containing mRNAs is two- to fivefold higher. dsRBD3 and dsRBD4 seem to be the only functional dsRNA-binding domains. differences in binding of STAU2 and STAU1 to UPF1 may be attributable to sequence variations in their TBDs. differences may be attributable to sequence variations in their TBDs, which share only 18% identity. STAU2 activates UPF1 helicase activity but not UPF1 ATP Hydrolytic Activity. nucleotide analog loosens the grip of UPF1 on RNA (28), and UPF2 in the presence of ATP enhances UPF1 helicase activity (27) at pH 6.5 the footprint of UPF1 alone (28) was found to be similar in size to the footprint of UPF1 in the presence of ADPNP (27, 28) STAU2 and possibly STAU2 bind to an SBS either individually or as homo- or hetero-multimers. we envision that STAU1 and/or STAU2 bind to an SBS either individually or, more likely, as homo- or hetero-multimers."}
