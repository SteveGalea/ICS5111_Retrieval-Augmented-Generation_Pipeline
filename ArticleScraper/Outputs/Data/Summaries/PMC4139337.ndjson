{"summary": "the western Arctic caribou herd (WACH) in Alaska is the largest caribou herd in north America. the size of the WACH reached a population apex of 490,000 individuals in 2003, but has declined to 325,000 animals in 2011. the size of the WACH reached a population apex of 490,000 individuals. surveillance of viruses in caribou is scarce [3], mostly based on serological assays. knowledge on virus infections in caribou is crucial, especially if diseased animals are identified or if epizootics appear. fewer sequences subjected to de novo assembly, the fewer pairwise comparisons have to be made. overlap-layout-consensus (OLC) assemblers start with a global analysis by constructing an overlap graph from the pairwise comparisons before consensus computation [19]. the fewer sequences subjected to de novo assembly, the fewer pairwise comparisons have to be made, thereby reducing time of computation and memory usage. a swab sample was obtained from the mucosa of the lower eye lid and from the nose, 3\u20134 cm inside one nostril, from each animal. the swabs were kept cool at the sampling site, frozen the same day on liquid nitrogen and kept at 80\u00b0C. a number of 15 000 (once), 10 000 (six times) and 5000 reads (six times) were simulated with Metasim version 0.9.1 [25] from a database containing 2314 human genes, 12 microbial genomes, and 50 viral genomes. the reads were simulated with a 454-specific error profile and a mean length of 252 bases. metagenomes were subjected to de novo assembly with six different assembly strategies. the former omitted the final step of mapping of the trimmed reads. sequences were assembled once with CAP3 (VersionDate 12/21/07) taxonomic units of all reindeer samples were subjected to a tBLASTX with stringent e-value cut-offs against sequences of the subfamily Torovirinae. phylogenetic analysis Alignments were prepared with MAFFT version 7 using default parameters (Blosum62) taxonomic units with a best-BLAST hit against a member of the papillomaviridae family were subjected to a BLASTN search against a collection of papillomavirus L1 gene sequences retrieved from the papillomavirus Episteme. nucleotide sequence accession numbers The L1 nucleotide sequence of RtPV4, VP2 and NS1 sequences of caribou parvovirus the swabs were kept cool at the sampling site, frozen the same day on liquid nitrogen and kept at 80\u00b0C. the swabs were kept cool at the sampling site, frozen the same day on liquid nitrogen and kept at 80\u00b0C. a number of 15 000 (once), 10 000 (six times) and 5000 reads (six times) were simulated with Metasim version 0.9.1 [25] from a database containing 2314 human genes, 12 microbial genomes, and 50 viral genomes. the reads were simulated with a 454-specific error profile and a mean length of 252 bases. sequences without hits in the host-BLAST were then subjected to a BLASTX search against viral protein sequences present in the nr database at 07 November 2013. all sequences without hits were then subjected to a tBLASTX search against viral protein sequences present in the nr database. collection of papillomavirus L1 gene sequences of a variety of papillomaviruses was used for comparison. taxonomic units with best-BLAST hit against a member of the papillomaviridae family were subjected to a BLASTN search against a collection of papillomavirus L1 gene sequences. between 664 and 43 702 reads per sample were obtained from the caribou nose and eye swabs. the fifth method was composed of an initial assembly with Newbler. after which contigs and singletons were pooled and subjected to exhaustive iterative assembly with CAP3 until convergence of the assembly (\u201cIterative\u201d). white: Box plots of the percentage of assembled reads from 13 simulated metagenomic dataset containing non-overlapping reads. top and bottom of the box indicate the first and third quantile, the band inside the box marks the median. whiskers extend to the upper and lower quartiles, and outliers are plotted as individual points. there was no significant difference in taxonomic content between eye and nose swabs in these broad categories. the nasal swab of animal 26 (adult female) constituted an outlier. this was exemplified by plotting the theoretical quantiles of the normal distribution against the sample quantiles of the compression factors. taxonomic units related to known viruses of the family polyomaviridae were detected in eye and nose swabs of animal 2 (adult female) sequences related to the papillomaviridae family were found in 24 animals. phylogenetic tree was generated for a subset of representative papillomaviruses. most closely related papillomaviruses to RtPV4 were those from the genera delta- and Epsilonpapillomavirus with 63% nucleotide identity in L1. the genome organization was comparable to that of delta- and Epsilonpapillomaviruses as well. the remaining five samples (three eye swabs and two nose swabs) from four different animals had in total seven putative L1 sequences. five were most closely related to members of genus Xipapillomavirus from cattle (BPV12, BPV10, and BPV11) papillomavirus is a genus in the family Parvoviridae which consists of small, icosahedral, non-enveloped viruses. four species (Human parvovirus B19, pig-tailed macaque parvovirus, Rhesus macaque parvovirus and Simian parvovirus) and two tentative members have been identified. phylogenetic tree was constructed with a partial helicase amino acid sequence from animal 9 and the corresponding sequences of other Nidoviruses. phylogenetic tree was constructed with a partial helicase amino acid sequence from animal 9 and the corresponding sequences of other Nidoviruses. we tentatively called Carinivirus due to low viral titers in the samples and a finite volume of samples. phylogenetic analysis of caribou nidovirus was not successful. Phylogenetic analysis of caribou polyomavirus shows 62.5% amino acid identity to these viruses. between 664 and 43 702 trimmed reads per sample were obtained from the caribou nose and eye swabs. iterative assembly approach with mapping had significantly more reads assembled than Newbler alone. this is not the case for assembly with CLC Genomics Workbench, CAP3 or exhaustive iterative assembly without mapping. the amount of taxonomic units that needed analyses was reduced significantly. four assembly strategies had very low chimera rates with a median of less than 0.5% (Newbler, CAP3, iterative assembly and iterative assembly with mapping) Mira showed a median chimera rate of 1.5% and CLC Genomics Workbench median of 9.4% with the tested parameters. the exhaustive iterative assembly approach with or without mapping seemed to give the best results in terms of reliability of the assembly and compression of the output. a large part of the retrieved viral sequences were obtained from bacteriophages. animal 13 (adult male) contained a taxonomic unit composed of two reads that had homology to a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of a human picobirnavirus. papillomaviruses are classified on basis of the phylogenetic distance of the entire L1 sequence to other members of the family. intergeneric identities range from about 43\u201362%, interspecies identities from about 55\u201371%, and intraspecies identities from about 67\u201388%. the genome organization, biology, and pathogenicity were comparable to that of delta- and Epsilonpapillomaviruses. Phylogenetic analysis of caribou papillomavirus RtPV4. all sequences were retrieved from PAVE (http://pave.niaid.nih.gov) taxonomic units from 10 samples identified as a fragment of putative L1 proteins were used to estimate the closest relative within the family papillomaviridae. the nasal swab from animal 27 contained at least two different papillomaviruses types. sequences from nose and eye of animal 19 had both a closest homology with BPV10, suggesting the same infection in nose and eyes. the contigs were covering putative capsid protein genes with a nucleotide identity of 70%\u201375% to the corresponding genome regions of bovine parvovirus 3. the caribou parvovirus clustered closely with bovine parvovirus type 3 and other members of the genus Erythrovirus. a total of 11 taxonomic units composed of 37 reads in three eye swabs of animals 9, 27, and 30, all adult females showed homology to members of the family Coronaviridae, subfamily Torovirinae. phylogenetic tree was constructed with a partial helicase amino acid sequence from animal 9 and the corresponding sequences of other Nidoviruses. the international committee on taxonomy of Viruses officially lists thirteen species of polyomaviruses. three genera, two containing mammalian viruses (genus Orthopolyomavirus) and one containing avian viruses (genus Avipolyomavirus) have been proposed. the presence of viruses in free-ranging caribou was studied by a metagenomic survey of swab samples obtained from the mucosa of the eye and nose. the metagenomes were subjected to different assembly algorithms prior to homology search to optimize the chance of identifying viral species in the metagenome dataset. the choice might be different even for similar projects. up to 6.6% of sequence reads were of viral origin in each sample. members of the family Papillomaviridae were the most prevalent identified mammalian viruses in the caribou samples. papillomaviruses have been identified a few times in reindeer. the disease is observed from time to time, both in wild reindeer and semi-domesticated reindeer. papillomatosis may contribute to severe conditions and mortality of affected individuals. the caribou polyomavirus was most closely related to chimpanzee polyomavirus in a parial large T antigen fragment and would likely constitute a new polyomavirus species. if the caribou polyomavirus is involved in causing disease in caribou remains to be determined. papilloma-, polyoma-, corona-, and parvoviruses from caribou have been found. papilloma-, polyoma-, corona-, and parvoviruses from caribou have been found. the nidovirus sequences were detected in eye swabs of caribou only. datasets were further reduced by mapping of trimmed reads to taxonomic units. indicated are the number of taxonomic units, i.e. the sum of contigs and singletons. the most prominent outlier was excluded from further analysis."}
