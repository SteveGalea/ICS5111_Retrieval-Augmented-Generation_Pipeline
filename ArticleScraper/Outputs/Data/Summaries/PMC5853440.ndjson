{"summary": "RNA from fresh, sort-purified CD4+ T cells was assessed by RNA sequencing. RNA sequencing reliably measured approximately 60% of the genome. syncytial virus\u2013infected infants were selected for this analysis. a second cohort was enrolled when seen for acute respiratory symptoms in pediatric offices or emergency rooms. the third cohort consisted of infants hospitalized with RSV at URMC\u2019s Golisano Children\u2019s Hospital. the hospitalized infants were seen daily until discharge. library construction and Sequencing RNA sequencing was performed as previously described. libraries were constructed using the NexteraXT library kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq2500 to generate approximately 20 million 100-bp single end-reads per sample. we performed 2-sample Welch t tests to check the equality of mean values between 2 patient groups defined by disease severity. breastfeeding was modeled as a categorical variable (None Some Exclusive) and tested using Spearman\u2019s rank correlation. a nasal swab was placed in 2 mL of sterile ultraviolet-inactivated water and 2\u20133 mL of heparinized blood collected. a second blood sample was collected during a second visit 12\u201316 days after illness onset. a second blood sample was collected during a second visit (convalescent) Spearman correlation tests, with Benjamini-Hochberg correction to control false discovery rate at a 0.05 level, were used to select genes with significant correlation with continuous variables. pathway analysis and upstream regulator analysis Differentially expressed genes were used for canonical pathway identification and upstream regulator analysis using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. smoke (23% vs 4%; P =.01), and less likely to be breastfed (65% vs 87%; P =.05) the more severely ill group was significantly more likely to be colonized with S. pneumoniae and/or H. influenzae. colonizationc; no. (%) Streptococcus pneumoniae and/or Haemophilus influenza 7 (30) 15 (65). a total of 51 samples from 38 subjects were sorted and subjected to RNA-seq analysis. the raw reads, mapping rate, and gene detection rates are shown in Figure 1. samples averaged approximately 20M reads with >90% mapping rate. number of genes identified as significant for each variable and model. severity of illness continued to have the strongest association with gene expression (n = 140 genes), albeit now only slightly greater than sex (n = 113 genes) ingenuity pathway analysis was used to identify canonical pathways represented by genes associated with severity in CD4 lymphocytes from respiratory syncytial virus\u2013infected subjects. the variables used to generate gene sets for IPA were multivariate severity phenotype (a; n = 140) and univariate severity phenotype (b; n = 551) ouritol 3-kinase (PIK)/AKT signaling pathways were noted in severely affected subjects. interleukin 9 (IL-9) pathway signaling was also predicted to be altered. it was unclear whether this pathway was activated or inhibited. activity to predict transcription factor activity based on CD4 gene expression patterns associated with severity. changes in GATA3 activity predicted to be significantly associated with severity. changes in CD4 T-cell subtype differentiation are associated with severity. eight pathways are shown where Fisher\u2019s exact test P values were.05 for at least 1 analysis. orange and blue circles indicate predicted increased or decreased pathway activation (activation z score), respectively. RICTOR (mTOR2 related), CLOCK, and NFE2L2 (NRF2) may play a significant role in these responses. ingenuity pathway analysis was used to identify pathways represented by genes associated with infection by RSV group (A/B) in CD4 lymphocytes. CD7 expression levels were low, which is likely the source of failure to validate expression estimates. quantitative polymerase chain reaction expression estimates confirmed SOCS2 expression was significantly associated with severity. CD4, OAS1, and RSAD2 were all significantly associated with time since onset of clinical symptoms. the more severely ill group was significantly more likely to be colonized with S. pneumoniae and/or H. influenzae. the more severely ill group was significantly more likely to be colonized with S. pneumoniae and/or H. influenzae. Streptococcus pneumoniae and/or Haemophilus influenza 7 (30) 15 (65) were sorted and subjected to RNA-seq analysis. a total of 51 samples were subjected to RNA-seq analysis. samples from 38 subjects (n = 19 in each group) passed quality control (QC), and the remaining samples were removed from analysis. the raw reads, mapping rate, and gene detection rates are shown in Figure 1. bacterial cocolonization seems to have a greater effect on gene expression (n = 551 genes) yncytial virus group 53 68 Viral coinfection and/or bacterial colonization 3 67 Bacterial colonization with Streptococcus pneumonia and/or Haemophilus influenza 12 44 Gestational age 1 41 Visit age 2 18 Time since onset of illness; acute vs convalescent 35 63 Time since onset of illness 41 6 Shown are the numbers of genes identified as significant for each variable and model. ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) was used to identify canonical pathways represented by genes associated with severity in CD4 lymphocytes from respiratory syncytial virus\u2013infected subjects. variables used to generate gene sets for IPA were multivariate severity phenotype (a; n = 140) and univariate severity phenotype (b; n = 551) dylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathways were noted in severely affected subjects. interleukin 9 (IL-9) pathway signaling was also predicted to be altered. it was unclear whether this pathway was activated or inhibited. transcription factor activity predicted to be significantly associated with severity. changes in GATA3 activity predicted to be significantly associated with severity. changes in CD4 T-cell subtype differentiation are associated with severity in RSV infection. eight pathways are shown where Fisher\u2019s exact test P values were.05 for at least 1 analysis. orange and blue circles indicate predicted increased or decreased pathway activation (activation z score), respectively. RICTOR (mTOR2 related), CLOCK, and NFE2L2 (NRF2) may play a significant role in these responses. ingenuity pathway analysis was used to identify pathways represented by genes associated with infection by RSV group (A/B) in CD4 lymphocytes. expression of 5 of these genes (CD4, FKBP5, OAS1, RSAD2, SOCS2) showed significant concordance with RNA-seq data (all P.001) CD7 expression levels were low, which is likely the source of failure to validate expression estimates. quantitative polymerase chain reaction expression estimates confirmed SOCS2 expression was significantly associated with severity. a study of 21 RSV-infected infants showed extensive activation of innate immune responses, specifically of the interferon signaling network, but could not identify differences according to disease severity. severe illness was associated with greater expression of neutrophil and inflammation genes than in mildly ill subjects, whereas mildly ill subjects showed overexpression of innate immunity genes. study found that exposure to prolactin receptor inhibited suppressive effect on Th1 cells in vitro. infants with severe RSV disease admitted to intensive care unit had significantly higher serum prolactin levels than moderately ill infants. interleukin 9, a Th2 cytokine produced by CD4 T cells, eosinophils, and neutrophils, has been found in the upper and lower airway secretions of infants with RSV bronchiolitis at relatively high levels. the authors concluded that IL-9 promoted a Th2-type inflammatory response. the results may help to identify potential biomarkers of severe disease and provide putative intermediate, molecular phenotypes of disease that can be assayed using experimental in vitro or in vivo infection models of RSV."}
