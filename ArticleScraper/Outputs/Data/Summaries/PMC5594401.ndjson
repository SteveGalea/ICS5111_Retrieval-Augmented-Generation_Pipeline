{"summary": "literature review: what outcomes should be taken into consideration when one is evaluating the effectiveness of ERC\" Literature Search We applied our search methodology to MEDLINE and EMBASE for articles published from January 1, 2001, to December 1, 2016. we considered articles for inclusion if they addressed issues regarding communications with the public during a large-scale emergency. humans, English, French, Italian, Spanish, Chinese, Portuguese EMBASE \u2018public health\u2019/exp OR \u2018public health\u2019:ab,ti OR \u2018world health\u2019:ab,ti AND (\u2018emergency\u2019:ab,ti AND \u2018emergency treatment\u2019/exp OR \u2018emergency care\u2019/exp OR \u2018disaster\u2019/exp OR \u2018terrorism\u2019/exp OR \u2018pandemic\u2019/exp OR pandemic* interviews were conducted by phone between October 2014 and January 2015. participants were asked to describe their experience in ERC. they were asked to identify factors contributing to ERC effectiveness. data were considered as satisfactory after the 13th interview. 5 additional interviews were conducted to ensure no new themes emerged. the final stage consisted of searching for patterns, associations, variations, and conceptual networks.

following emergencies or programs. despite lack of literature on how the macro context affects ERC, we decided to include the macro context in the framework to accentuate the importance of adopting realistic evaluation methods in ERC. realist methods recognize the existence of interwoven variables operating across different levels of society, differing from traditional cause\u2013effect, noncontextual methods of analysis. 45 empirical studies comprise evaluation work of this type, focusing on \u201cthe message\u201d or the totality of information produced in this environment. such studies describe how or when information related to specific threats is reported by public health organizations or the media, or is presented in social media. some studies present data on the message content regarding literacy level at which the message is written13; and message framing (the message\u2019s central organizing idea),14\u201316. information processing Ability to understand information about public health threats for self-protection and survival. some subgroups in society were more vulnerable during pandemics. knowledge and awareness Knowledge about specific threats and preventive behaviors. risk appraisals represent complex interactions between an individual\u2019s hazard features and personal philosophies. in emergency preparedness, risk perceptions are measured across 3 dimensions. populations demographics and socioeconomic factors affecting knowledge were also studied. key structural components and processes should be taken into consideration in evaluation activities as key factors contributing to ERC effectiveness. some relate to structural components of the public health system\u2019s response to an emergency. others refer to specific practices or processes ERC experts describe as particularly important to ERC effectiveness. the lack of coordination between experts in risk communication and risk assessment was mainly attributed to 2 factors: (1) messages to the public often need to be developed before the risk-assessment process is complete and (2) a lack of understanding between fields. interviewees also reported confusion regarding the role that health promotion and risk communication play in the context of emergency situations. interviewees discussed how political leaders may be concerned about the negative impact on the economy of a public health threat. gaining the population\u2019s trust should be another priority in ERC, including trust in the organization, the messengers, and the channels of dissemination. literature in emergency preparedness is increasingly focusing on the analysis of the information environment. 45 empirical studies comprised evaluation work of this type, focusing on the totality of information produced in this environment. some studies present data on the message content regarding literacy level at which the message is written. information exposure, information processing, and knowledge, attitudes, and practices are also studied as factors related to information processing and attitudes. risk perceptions, emotional reactions, and trust in the source or channel of information are also studied. the public uses a wide array of outlets to passively receive or actively look for information during emergency situations. the public uses a wide array of outlets to passively receive or actively look for information during emergencies. the public uses a wide array of outlets to passively receive or actively look for information during emergency situations. outcomes are related to changes in policies, mitigation strategies, and social consequences, which can be partially linked to the impact of ERC. examples include changes in distribution of medical countermeasures because of population\u2019s risk perceptions. examples include changes in the distribution of medical countermeasures because of population\u2019s risk perceptions. we derived population-level outcomes from 104 studies in which the data-gathering process included questions asked to the public through surveys, interviews, or focus groups. such outcomes included information exposure and information-seeking behaviors, information processing, and knowledge, attitudes, and practices. risk perceptions, emotional reactions, and trust in the source or channel of information are also studied as factors related to information processing and as attitudes. the public uses a wide array of outlets to passively receive or actively look for information during emergency situations. the public uses a wide array of outlets to passively receive or actively look for information during emergency situations. the public uses a wide array of outlets to passively receive or actively look for information during emergencies. the association between such outcomes and behaviors was widely studied during various emergencies, especially during the H1N1 pandemic. outcomes are related to changes in policies, mitigation strategies, and social consequences. examples include changes in the distribution of medical countermeasures because of population\u2019s risk perceptions. interviewees discussed the difficulty in engaging stakeholders in the plans\u2019 creation. the ability to evaluate both the extent of stakeholders\u2019 engagement in planning efforts, including their strengths and weaknesses within their respective jurisdictional responsibilities in ERC, were listed as key evaluation elements in the assessment of the planning development process. interviewees also reported confusion regarding the role that health promotion and risk communication play in the context of emergency situations. interviewees also noted that some organizations or units may cooperate well during routine activities, but not as well during emergency situations. gaining the population\u2019s trust should be another priority in ERC. gaining the population\u2019s trust should be another priority in ERC.

SSION During large-scale emergencies and crisis situations, risk communicators bear the responsibility of translating the complicated science produced by the risk assessment process into easily understandable and actionable communications. interviewees lamented that there is no framework for evaluation and evaluation tools in ERC, and creating measures applicable across different resource settings is extremely difficult. researchers and public health practitioners interested in the evaluation of ERC can use the conceptual framework described in this article to guide the development of evaluation studies and methods for assessing communication outcomes related to public health emergencies. the concept of efficiency and effectiveness in ERC is unique to this model, making it suitable for the evaluation of complex ERC strategies and programs. evaluation frameworks commonly describe outcomes in terms of time, categorizing them into short-, medium-, and long-term outcomes. in the context of ERC, \u201ctime\u201d is heavily dependent on the type of emergency, as some unfold over a short period (e.g., earthquakes) public health emergencies."}
