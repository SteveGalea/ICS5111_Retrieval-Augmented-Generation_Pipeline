{"summary": "no effective prophylactic or post-exposure therapy is currently available. however, chloroquine has strong antiviral effects on SARS-CoV infection of primate cells. these inhibitory effects are observed when the cells are treated with the drug either before or after exposure to the virus. spike glycoprotein is a type I membrane protein that facilitates viral attachment to the cellular receptor and initiation of infection. angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) has been identified as a functional cellular receptor of SARS-CoV. it is important to identify drugs that can effectively be used to treat or prevent potential SARS-CoV infections. chloroquine has been widely used to treat human diseases, such as malaria, amoebiosis, HIV, and autoimmune diseases, without significant detrimental side effects [15]. results Preinfection chloroquine treatment renders Vero E6 cells refractory to SARS-CoV infection. chloroquine-containing media were removed and the cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline before they were infected with SARS-CoV. the cells were maintained in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) for 16\u201318 h in the absence of chloroquine. as little as 0.1\u20131 M chloroquine reduced the infection by 50%. up to 90\u201394% inhibition was observed with 33\u2013100 M concentrations. post-infection chloroquine treatment reduces infection and spread of SARS-CoV. a higher concentration of chloroquine was required if the drug was added 3 or 5 h after infection. chloroquine (10, 25, and 50 M) was added 3 or 5 h after infection. NH4Cl inhibits SARS-CoV infection of vero E6 cells. antigen-positive cells were counted, and the results were presented as in Fig. 1B. effect of chloroquine and NH4Cl on cell surface expression of ACE2. neither drug caused significant change in the levels of cell-surface ACE2. 113-kDa protein is endoglycosidase H resistant and represents the Golgi-modified form of ACE2 [19]. the specificity of the antibody was confirmed by displacing the immunoreactive protein bands with excess cold-soluble human recombinant ACE2. a stepwise increase in the migration of the 113-kDa protein was observed with increasing concentrations of NH4Cl. neuraminidase treatment of immunoprecipitated ACE2 treated cells with 1\u201325 M concentrations of chloroquine during starvation, pulse, and 3-h chase. ACE2 undergoes terminal sugar modifications and that the terminal glycosylation of ACE2 inhibits virus entry. neuraminidase-treated ACE2 is affected by NH4Cl or chloroquine treatment. ACE2 undergoes terminal glycosylation, but the ER form of ACE2 was not affected by neuraminidase. neuraminidase-treated ACE2 was treated with 10 M chloroquine. kDa precursor (proS-ER) was processed into 125-, 105-, and 80-kDa proteins. chloroquine at 100 M resulted in an overall decrease in biosynthesis. the antiviral effect is probably not due to alteration of virus glycoprotein biosynthesis and processing. cells were labeled for 30 min (A) and chased for 3 h (B) proS-ER and proS-Golgi are the pro-spike of SARS-Co in the ER and Golgi compartments. NH4Cl abrogated the appearance of Golgi-modified forms at 10 mM. chloroquine (25 and 50 M) and NH4Cl (1 mM) doses are not affected at chloroquine (25 and 50 M) and NH4Cl (1 mM) doses that cause virus inhibitory effects. chloroquine at 100 and NH4Cl at 40 and 20 mM resulted in slightly faster mobility of the trimers. for quantitative purposes, we counted the number of positively stained control cells. the average number of positively stained control cells was scored as 100%. pretreatment with 0.1, 1 and 10 M chloroquine reduced infectivity by 28%, 53%, and 100%. 0.1\u20131 M chloroquine reduced the infection by 50% and up to 90\u201394% inhibition was observed with 33\u2013100 M concentrations. a half-maximal inhibitory effect was estimated to occur at 4.4 1.0 M chloroquine. electron microscopic analysis indicated the appearance of significant amounts of extracellular virus particles 5\u20136 h after infection. we added chloroquine 3 and 5 h after virus adsorption. to obtain equivalent antiviral effect, a higher concentration of chloroquine was required if the drug was added 3 or 5 h after infection. NH4Cl ( 5 mM) and chloroquine ( 10 M) are very effective in reducing SARS-CoV infection. these results suggest that effects of chloroquine and NH4Cl in controlling SARS-CoV infection might be mediated by similar mechanism(s) two immunoreactive ACE2 forms migrating at 105 and 113 kDa respectively. the 113-kDa protein is endoglycosidase H resistant and represents the Golgi-modified form of ACE2. a stepwise increase in the migration of the 113-kDa protein was observed. NH4Cl and chloroquine both impaired the terminal glycosylation of ACE2. variations in its glycosylation status might render the ACE2-SARS-CoV interaction less efficient and inhibit virus entry. neuraminidase treatment of immunoprecipitated ACE2 treated cells with 1\u201325 M concentrations of chloroquine during starvation, pulse, and 3-h chase. ACE2 undergoes terminal glycosylation and that the terminal glycosylation is affected by NH4Cl or chloroquine treatment. chloroquine or ammonium chloride was added to these cells during while they were starved (1 h), labeled (30 min) or chased (3 h). the cell lysates were analyzed by immunoprecipitation with the SARS-specific polyclonal antibody (HMAF). NH4Cl and chloroquine (CQ) were added during periods of starvation (1 h) and labeling (30 min) with 35S-Cys. the cells presented were labeled for 30 min (A) and chased for 3 h (B) proS-ungly is the unglycosylated pro-spike ER. only at 100 M chloroquine was a reduction in the level of the Golgi-modified pro-spike observed (lane 3) NH4Cl abrogated the appearance of Golgi-modified forms at 10 mM (lane 8 with 9\u201311) and had a milder effect at 1 mM (lane 12). keyaerts et al. [21] reported the antiviral properties of chloroquine. they identified that the drug affects SARS-CoV replication in cell culture. this is evidenced by quantitative RT-PCR. NH4Cl or chloroquine may affect the surface expression of the under-glycosylated ACE2. the impairment of terminal glycosylation of ACE2 may result in reduced binding affinities between ACE2 and SARS-CoV spike protein. the potential contribution of these drugs in the elevation of endosomal pH and its impact on subsequent virus entry or exit could not be ruled out. NH4Cl and chloroquine inhibited the production of infectious HIV-1 particles by interfering with terminal glycosylation of the glycoprotein [24,25] on the basis of these properties, we suggest that the cell surface expression of under-glycosylated ACE2 and its poor affinity to SARS-CoV spike protein may be the primary mechanism by which infection is prevented. chloroquine is a relatively safe, effective and cheap drug used for treating human diseases including malaria, amoebiosis and human immunodeficiency virus. the fact that the drug has significant inhibitory antiviral effect when the susceptible cells were treated either prior to or after infection. becco's modified Eagle medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. cells were incubated on ice with 10 g/mL affinity-purified goat anti-ACE2 antibody (R&D Systems) and then incubated with FITC-labeled swine anti-goat IgG antibody.
