{"summary": "biopharmaceuticals, including vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, and other therapeutic proteins, are rapidly emerging into the marketplace. commercialized plant-derived biopharmaceuticals are offered by Protalix Bio Therapeutics, Inc. (Karmiel, Israel), Planet Biotechnology, Inc. (Hayward, CA, USA), and Icon Genetics, GmbH (Halle, Germany) plant viruses have been engineered to express vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, and other therapeutic proteins. first generation virus expression vectors are based on a full virus strategy. a third plant virus strategy using viruses as nanoparticles has arisen as a means by which, among other things, cancer can be addressed. plant viruses can be functionalized to target and deliver antiviral agents into tumors. the external surfaces of rod-shaped plants can be functionalized to target and deliver antiviral agents into tumors. plant viruses can be used for diagnosis and immunotherapy. on a TMV that is housed within an Agrobacterium tumefaciens binary vector has also been developed by Musiychuk et al. in 2007 to generate vaccines against cholera, the influenza virus, and the plague. foreign protein expression in TMV infected plants can also be enhanced significantly through the coexpression of the RNA silencing suppressor gene P19 of the Tomato bushy stunt virus. TMV particles have been shown to be taken up by dendritic cells. they exhibit activation properties, resulting in robust CD8+ T cell responses. this has sparked renewed interest in the use of this virus as a delivery vehicle for immunotherapy. each vaccine construct has successfully passed Phase I clinical trials. the number of patients who mounted immune responses was comparable to the results of earlier clinical trials using follicular lymphoma idiotype vaccines that have been generated using other production platforms. the plant-derived N protein can be used to examine the presence of N-specific antibodies in the sera of patients exposed to coronavirus. the researchers fused M2e to bacterial flagellin, a strong mucosal adjuvant, in order to improve M2e immunogenicity. PVX nanofilaments carry monoclonal antibodies of herceptin (Trastuzumab) for breast cancer patients [56] could induce apoptosis in breast cancer cell lines. papMV nanoparticles can elicit an -IFN-dependent response, and when administered intra-tumorally can slow down melanoma progression. CPMV has been used extensively in antigenic presentation and full-length protein expression as part of a fusion protein that can undergo proteolytic cleavage to release the therapeutic protein. CPMV has been used extensively in antigenic presentation and full-length protein expression as part of a fusion protein that can undergo proteolytic cleavage to release the therapeutic protein. CPMV nanoparticles can be driven to self-assemble in the absence of RNA. capsid proteins can be driven to self-assemble in the absence of RNA to form empty non-infectious virus-like particles (eVLPs) they can be directly applied to a tumor and alter the surrounding microenvironment to potentiate tumor immunity through the activation of quiescent neutrophils. pEff is smaller in size and has been used to express a candidate influenza vaccine protein m2e fused to HBc. in the second example, TMV has been used to express the genome of the Alphavirus Flock house virus (FHV), a small insect virus that can replicate to high levels in plants without inducing apoptosis. a geminivirus vector has been used to generate a vaccine against hepatitis A. a dual-module in-plant activation platform was developed in tobacco yellow dwarf virus (TYDV) to control foreign gene expression. the protein of interest is expressed only after post-transcriptional processing, thus offering further control of the gene of interest. plant virus nanoparticles with drugs functionalized to their surfaces would be efficacious, low in cost, easy to produce en masse, and low in toxicity. if these obstacles are overcome, it would seem that many of the examples presented in this review could play a significant role in improving the lives of many."}
