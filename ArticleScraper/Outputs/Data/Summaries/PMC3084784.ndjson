{"summary": "human chromosome 19q13.4 contains important immune cell receptor genes [3], such as killer cell inhibitory receptors (KIRs), leukocyte immunoglobulin (Ig)-like receptors (LILRs), leukocyte associated Ig-like receptors (LAIRs) and the Fc receptor (FcR) there are 13 members of either activating or inhibitory receptors in the LILR family. soluble LILRs can be categorized into 2 groups according to the amino acid sequence similarity of the region responsible for binding to human leukocyte antigen (HLA) it is well known that LILRB1 and LILRB2 bind to a broad range of classical and non-classical HLAIs [13], [14], [15] and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-like molecules, such as UL18 [16]. ILRA5 [22] as Group 2 LILRs have no residues in the D1 domain. there is no so called \u201chydrophobic core\u201d by strands-helices transition in the D1 domain. however, the structure and evaluation of LILRA3 binding to HLAIs are required to confirm this hypothesis. 310 helices region in domain 1 of Group 1 LILRs are demarcated with green. we report binding properties of the LILRA3 D1 and D1D2 domains to HLAIs. the crystal structure of the LILRA3 D1 domain clearly displays conformational changes in the residues responsible for the binding to HLAIs. size-exclusion of the refolded materials and SDS-PAGE analysis indicated the correct molecular weight of the single and double Ig-domains [31]. Similarly, far UV circular dichroism (CD) spectra indicated that each sample was comprised of -sheet secondary structure. thus, the two proteins, LILRA3 D1 and D1D2, were successfully refolded, purified with high purity, and used to evaluate the binding of LILRA3 to first, we evaluated the binding affinity of LILRB2 to HLA-A*0201 and HLA-G1 using standard amine coupling chemistry. both LILRA3 D1 and D1D2 bound to HLA-A*0201 and HLA-G1 with affinities in the range of 20\u201340 M. previous research demonstrates that Group 1 LILRs bind with a higher affinity to non-classical HLAIs. for HLA-A*0201, it showed a further reduced binding affinity (K d = 28.5 M) similar to that of LILRA3 D1 binding to HLA-G1 (K d = 26.8 M) but still reached binding affinity range of CD8 (100 M) refolding and purification procedures failed to yield any diffractive crystals of LILRA3 D1D2. overall structure of the LILRA3 D1 domain has characteristics consistent with Ig-like domain structures. structure also displays properties unique to the LILR family. the loop region of LILRA3 D1 superposed on the LILRB2 D1D2 (pink) superposed on the LILRB2 D1D2 (2GW5-yellow) most of the hydrophobic residues on the strands and the 310 helices face toward the interior of this hydrophobic core. this hydrophobic core pushes the adjacent hydrophilic residues to assume a proper conformation for its binding to HLAIs. there are differences around the 78\u201383 loop region between LILRA3 D1 and LILRB1 D1 (RMSD = 0.857 for 2GW5) differences around the 29\u201333 and 77\u201383 loop regions between LILRA3 D1 and LILRB2 D1 (Fig. 4D) the NH3 + of Lys91 in the 2m of HLA-A*0201 deep intrudes into the aromatic ring of LILRA3 D1 Trp67. NH3 + of Lys91 in the 2m of HLA-A*0201 deep intrudes into the aromatic ring of LILRA3 D1 Trp67. the hydrophobic interactions of LILRB2 Ser43 with the residues (Val194 and Val248) of the 3 domain of H the superposition of LILRA3 D1 to LILRB1/HLA-A*0201 (green) and LILRB2/HAL-G1 (yellow) would bind to both HLA-A*0201 and HLA-G1. the yellow dotted line represents the polar interaction between the residues of LILRA3 D1 and that of HLA-G1. the lack of polar interactions in the LILRA3 D1/HLA-A*0201 complex would reduce the binding affinity between these molecules. both Leu37 and His36 in LILRA3 D1 form hydrogen bonds with Tyr197 of the 3 domain of the heavy chain of HLA-G1. the superposition of LILRA3 D1 with LILRB1/HLA-A*0201 and LILRB2/HLA-G1 clearly demonstrates that LILRA3 may bind to both classical and non-classical HLAIs than classical HLAIs. however, these changes do not affect the interaction between LILRA3 D1 and HLA-G1 because they favor the binding mode. the relatively rigid conformation of Lys42 due to the interaction with Glu68 makes it impossible for Lys42 to interact with Asp96 of the 3 domain of HLA-A*0201. however, in the binding mode, Lys42 forms a hydrogen bond with Glu229 of the 2m of HLA-G1, as well as with Glu68 of LILRA3 D1. despite the high sequence similarity around Glu68 and Lys42 among LILRA3, LILRB the loop in question is flexible, as in LILRA3 D1. however, there is also no hydrogen bond between Lys42 and Glu68 of LILRA3 D1. soluble protein characterization and BIAcore\u00ae binding LILRA3 is a soluble protein, the only secreted member of the LILR family. the full-length sequence encoding LILRA3 was cloned from a human lymphocyte cDNA library (Strata Gene) the fragments encoding the LILRA3 D1 or D1D2 regions were cloned from the full-length LILRA3 gene. analysis of inclusion body preparations and size exclusion chromatography profiles of LILRA3 D1 and D1D2 by ITPG. the first two lanes are the samples before IPTG induction, and the next two are the samples after IPTG induction. the last lane is the molecular weight standard (shown in kDa) LILRB2 D1D2 was injected over the CM5 sensor surface on which HLAIs were immobilized using standard amine coupling chemistry. the affinity constants of LILRB2 D1D2 binding to HLA-A*0201 and HLA-G1 were 9.74 and 5.62 M, respectively. both LILRA3 D1 and D1D2 bound to HLAIs with affinities in the range of 20\u201340 M. analysis of LILRBA3 D1 and D1D2 monomer binding to immobilized HLA-A*0201 and HLA-G1. protein at indicated concentrations was injected through the HLA-G1-immobilized flow cells (300 RU) one sheet containing three anti-parallel strands (A, B and E) and the other containing four anti-parallel strands (C, F, G and A\u2032). the other containing four anti-parallel strands (C, F, G and A\u2032) [18] also has a pocket-type hydrophobic core surrounded by the C and E strands. LILRA3 D1 has a high level (>80%) of amino acid sequence identity with LILRB1 and B2. there are differences around the 78\u201383 loop region between LILRA3 D1 and LILRB1 D1 (RMSD = 0.348 for 1G0X, 0.336 for 1UFU) than LILRB2. the differences in these regions may not affect the binding of LILRA3 to HLAIs. the differences in these regions may not affect the binding of LILRA3 to HLAIs. polar and hydrophobic interactions in superposition of LILRA3 D1 to LILRB1/HLA-A*0201. polar and hydrophobic interactions in superposition of LILRA3 D1 to LILRB1/HLA-A*0201 (green) and LILRB2/HAL-G1. the yellow dotted line represents the polar interaction between the residues of LILRA3 D1 and that of HLA-A*0201. the pink dotted line represents the polar interaction between the residues of LILRA3 D1 and that of HLA-A*0201. the superposition of LILRA3 D1 with LILRB2 D1D2/HLA-G1 shows a strong polar interaction with Tyr197 of the 3 domain of the heavy chain of HLA-G1. both Leu37 and His36 in LILRA3 D1 form hydrogen bonds with Tyr197 of the 3 domain of the heavy chain of HLA-G1. the changes of the amino acids at positions 36 and 76 between LILRA3 (His36 and Ile76) and LILRB1 (Arg36 and Tyr76) are one of the important reasons for the reduced binding affinity of LILRA3 to HLA-A*0201 compared to that of LILRB1 to HLA-A*0201. however, these changes do not affect the interaction between LILRA3 D1 and HLA-G1 because they favor the LILRB2/HLA the structure around Lys42 and Trp67 in the LILRA3 D1/LILRB1 D1 and LILRA3 D1/LILRB2 D1 structures is not clear why the Lys42 of LILRA3 D1 and B2 do not form a self-interaction with Glu68. the loop of LILRA3 D1 between the C strand and 310 helix 1 is relatively rigid (due to its hydrogen bond with Glu40) Glu68 of LILRB2 points toward the opposite direction of Lys42, making self-interaction impossible in LILRB2. one or two amino acid differences in the binding region or its adjacent region greatly influence the binding affinities for classical and non-classical HLAIs. BIAcore\u00ae SPR demonstrated that LILRA3 binds both classical and non-classical HLAIs with reduced affinities compared to LILRB1/HLA-A*0201 and LILRB2/G1 binding. the crystal structure of LILRA3 D1 also supports these results. if it displays self-interaction of Lys42 with Glu68, the binding affinity may be reduced relative to LILRB1 or B2. LILRA3 may greatly control the inhibition of the immune response induced by LILRB1, LILRB2 and other HLA-binding LILR molecules like LILRA1. the crystal structure of the D1 domain and the SPR binding properties of LILRA3 indicated that LILRA3 binds HLA-G1 preferentially over HLA-A*0201, which explains its possible function in fetal-maternal immune control. full-length LILRA3 gene was cloned from a human lymphocyte cDNA library. DNA fragments encoding the LILRA3 D1 and D1D2 regions were sub-cloned from the full-length gene. a start or stop codon was introduced with NdeI or XhoI restriction sites accordingly. clones of the recombinant HLA-A*0201 and HLA-G1 were previously prepared. all proteins were expressed in BL21 (DE3) pLysS and purified as previously reported. inclusion body solution was injected into refolding buffer containing 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mM EDTA, 400 mM L-arginine-HCl, 0.5 mM oxidized gluta the proteins were further purified by anion exchange chromatography (Source Q) followed by final gel filtration on superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) with BIAcore buffer (HEPES, pH 7.4) the size exclusion chromatogram and the 12% SDS-PAGE of the main fractions confirmed the monomeric state of LILRB2 D1D2, HLA-A*0201, and HLA-G1. the collected intensities were indexed, integrated, corrected for absorption, scaled, and merged using HKL-2000. X-ray diffraction data processing and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. amine group coupling on research grade CM5 sensor chips at pH 5.0. LILRB2 D1D2, LILRA3 D1 and LILRA3D1D2 in HEPES buffer (10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, and 0.005% (v/v) Tween-20) were then injected over the immobilized HLAIs at 25\u00b0C. atomic coordinates all PCR products were ligated into the pET21a vector (Novagen) all proteins were expressed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS. the inclusion body solution was injected into refolding buffer containing 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mM EDTA, 400 mM L-arginine-HCl, 0.5 mM oxidized glutathione, 5 mM the refolding solution was concentrated using a Stirred Cell and ultracentrifugal filter devices (Millipore) all proteins were purified by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 75 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) the buffer was exchanged gradually to BIAcore buffer (HEPES, pH 7.4) and finally filtered on 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) the best crystals were obtained using 1.0 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M HEPES buffer and 0.75% (w/v) PEG8000. the LILRA3 D1 crystal was cryoprotected in mother liquor containing 15% glycerol before being flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. the stereochemical quality of the final model was assessed with the PROCHECK program. BIAcore\u00ae SPR analysis of LILRA3 D1 and D1D2 BIAcore\u00ae3000 was used to study the direct binding of LILRA3 D1 and D1D2 to HLA-A*0201 and HLA-G1."}
