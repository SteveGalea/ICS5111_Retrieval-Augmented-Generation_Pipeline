Pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) was the first pneumococcal antigen to enter the clinical trial stage46 before the introduction of PCV7. however, an increase in new clones and serotypes in the post-PCV era has re-emphasized the need of serotype-independent formulations. despite the ability of most pneumococcal serotypes to colonize the mouse nasopharynx, pneumococcus is primarily a human pathogen. antibody responses generated with recombinant PcpA vaccination have been shown to provide protection against systemic infection36 but not against colonization50 in mice. IL-17A, antigen specific IgG; colonization and sepsis 144 WCV IL-17A; colonization and sepsis 35,145 Candidate protein vaccines for pneumococci are T cell-dependent antigens. there is no comprehensive account of their ability to elicit antigen-specific CD4+ T cell help. the human NP mucosal environment is a niche for complex polymicrobial interactions. most frequent pathogenic upper respiratory mucosal colonizers of children are pneumococci, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Staphylococcus aureus. the dynamics of bacterial co-colonization in young child's upper NP environment differs during health and at the onset of AOM with concurrent viral upper respiratory infections. negative associations were found between S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae and between H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis. co-colonization of M. catarrhalis with S. pneumoniae also increased pneumococcal protein specific antibody responses. these findings reveal the selective maturation of antigen specific immune responses in the upper airway of healthy children that favor the selection and predominance of one colonizer over another. URIs shift the dynamics of pathogenesis in favor of local and systemic invasion. viral URIs facilitate pneumococcal proliferation in the NP. thereby pneumococci change from harmless commensals to disease agents. persistence of antigen specific immune memory is key to vaccine effectiveness. children start clearing pneumococcal carriage well before the acquisition of capsular polysaccharide-specific antibodies. role of antibodies appears to be dispensable in protection against primary pneumococcal colonization in mouse models, but their role in humans seems to be more essential. antibodies directed to PhtD and PhtE partly contribute to protection against secondary pneumococcal NP colonization in mice. infants and young children start developing pneumococcal protein antigen-specific antibodies much earlier in their life than antibodies against capsular polysaccharides. invasive pneumococcal disease was prevented in mice passively immunized with sera from colonized adults. IgG responses against a number of protein antigens were boosted following NP colonization in carriage-positive and less so in carriage-negative individuals. there was no association of baseline IgG to pneumococcal proteins and carriage. evidence from mouse models suggests an indispensable role of Th17 CD4+ cells in development of protective immunity against NP colonization. a gradual Th17-dependent recruitment of monocyte/macrophage to the site of colonization over the course of weeks was found to clear primary colonization in adult mice. human data on age-specific changes in the immune system and Th17 response in early life is limited. in an adult human experimental carriage model, frequency of cognate IL-17A-secreting CD4+ memory T cells increased in broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) and blood. notwithstanding the potent Th17-polarizing innate response (IL-6 and IL-23) in mouse neonates, mice slowly and gradually develop CD4 Th17 responses (IL-17A) there is decreased IL-17A secretion by human and murine neonatal cells. despite that, there is decreased IL-17A secretion by humans. despite the immunogenicity of protein antigens in early life, antibody responses are weaker and shorter-lived than responses elicited in adults. repeated vaccine doses are therefore needed to elicit protective antibodies and persistence of protective levels during the first years of life. 71,124 is a matter of intense investigation as to how polymicrobial interaction in early years of life could manipulate the generation of T cell immunity. despite adequate IL-6 and IL-23 levels in early life, the levels of IL-6 and IL-23 are crucial for immune homeostasis. IL-6 and TGF- balance is instrumental in determining the fate of T cell polarization. increased generation or recruitment of Tregs in secondary lymph nodes during early life could be utilized by the host as a mechanism to retain carriage. emergence of new serotypes has posed a significant challenge and has encouraged investigators to look for alternative capsular-independent vaccines. there has been a significant progress on the emergence of new pneumococcal vaccine candidates and formulations in recent past. some of these candidates have advanced to phase II clinical trials and we highly anticipate that they will qualify for use in the developed world but also in developing and third world countries where cost is a major deterrent. developed to correctly evaluate pneumococcal infection or vaccine-induced immunology and protection."}
