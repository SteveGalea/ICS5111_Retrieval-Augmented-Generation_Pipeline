Resultant products were desalted and analyzed by FTICR-MS. both primer pairs were tested against multiple isolates from the 3 previously known CoV species groups and from SARS-CoV isolates. the results from analysis of 14 CoV isolates are shown in Table 1. deconvoluted (neutral mass) mass spectra obtained for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase primer for the 3 human CoV, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, and severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2013associated CoV were tested individually and in a mixture. colors of the monoisotopic masses for the mixed spectra correspond to the individual viral species. dilutions of the SARS virus could reliably detect 1 PFU (300 genomes) per PCR reaction or 170 PFU (5.1 x 104 genomes) per mL serum. this finding is consistent with results for direct measurement of RNA viruses from patient samples (26). the cumulative probability of misclassifying 229E or OC43 as SARS was low (m >10), even allowing for unseen variations in those 2 viruses. base composition analysis would provide corroborative information and accurate species identification of CoV infections. Snijder et al. used sequence data from the replicase genes (5,487 bp) in ORF1b and suggested that the SARS-CoV was most closely related to and possibly an early split-off from group 2 CoV (20) substantial space exists around SARS-CoV where as yet undiscovered SARS-CoV could populate a subgroup without being confused with the group 2 or other CoV. mass spectrum from the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplicons from the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus obtained with the propynylated RNA-dependent RNA polymerase primer pairs. multiple charge states are observed across the m/z range shown. the inset shows an expanded view of the isotope envelope of the (M-27H+)27- species. base compositions were confirmed by sequencing. so the strategy described here enables identification of organisms without the need for prior knowledge of the sequence. we pooled the viral extracts from 3 human CoV, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, and SARS-CoV. we estimated the number of reverse-transcribed SARS genomes by competitive, quantitative PCR with a nucleic acid internal standard. by using this approach, PCR primers were sensitive to 102 PFU per PCR reaction (1.7 PFU/mL serum) by using this approach, PCR primers were sensitive to 3 genome equivalents per PCR reaction. the second application was the utility of the technique for exploration of animal reservoirs. we mathematically modeled base composition variations using known sequences of multiple isolates of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in GenBank. bc represents the number of changes in the A, G, C, and T bases needed for 1 species to be misidentified as another in the direction of the arrow. m represents the pairwise mutation distance between 2 species, or the cumulative probability of bc occurring. broad-range PCR reactions are capable of producing products from groups of organisms, rather than single species, and the information content of each PCR reaction is potentially very high. in many cases, including the SARS-CoV detection described in this article, priming across broadly conserved regions provides adequate species detection and taxonomic resolution."}
