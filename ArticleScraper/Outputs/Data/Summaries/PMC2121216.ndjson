{"summary": "complement activation occurs in vivo after WNV infection. compared levels of functional C3 and C4 in the serum of naive and WNV-infected C57BL/6 mice using an erythrocyte hemolysis assay. blot using equal volumes of serum (20 l of 1/50 dilution) from naive wild-type and C3/ mice. bands corresponding to the C3 chain (100 kD), C3 chain (75 kD) and C3dg (38 kD) are labeled. only 35% of wild-type C57BL/6 mice succumbed to infection. 83% of C1q/ (n = 60, P 0.0001), 100% of C4/ (n = 38, P 0.0001), 74% of fD/, (n = 57, P = 0.0004) and 96% of fB/ (n = 51, P 0.0001) mice died after WNV infection. the most severe phenotypes were observed in mice that had a combined deficiency in the classical and lectin pathways (C4/) or a complete deficiency in the alternative pathway (fB/) all pathways of complement activation are required for survival of WNV infection. wild-type (n = 95), C1q/ (n = 60), C4/ (n = 34), fD/ (n = 57), fB/ (n = 50), and C viremia peaked at day 2 after infection and decreased over the next several days. viremia peaked at day 2 after infection and decreased over the next several days. 80% (12 of 15) of wild-type spleen samples were positive for infectious virus at day 4 after infection. 60,000-fold lower levels of WNV RNA were detected in spleens of C4/ mice. WNV RNA was detected on the first and second days after infection in wild-type, wild-type, and wild-type mice (P 0.8) by 3 d after infection fourfold less WNV RNA was found in the draining inguinal lymph nodes of C1q (P = 0.05) and C4/ mice (P = 0.04). infectious virus was not recovered from the brains of wild-type adult mice until day 6. fD/ mice had 30-fold higher levels of WNV in the brain than C1q/ mice on day 4 after infection. the brains of wild-type, C1q/, C4/, and fD/ mice were harvested on day 10 sectioned and stained for WNV. representative images of the cerebellum, cortex, and brain stem were determined after staining three to four mice per group. serum samples from wild-type, C1q/, C4/, fD/, and fB/ mice were collected at the indicated time points. T cell response in C4/, C1q/, fD/, and fB/ mice CD8+ T cells are required for clearance of WNV from the CNS. deficiencies affected the response of CD8+ T cells to WNV infection. we evaluated intracellular IFN expression in splenocytes from mock- and WNV-infected mice. by day 8 after infection, there was a 2.5-fold increase in total number of splenic CD4+ and CD8+ cells that expressed IFN in both wild-type (P = 0.0007) and C1q/ mice (P = 0.03) leukocytes were isolated by percoll gradient centrifugation. the total number of brain infiltrating CD4+ or CD8+ T cells was determined by multiplying the total number of leukocytes from three pooled brains. no difference in CNS T cell migration was observed in the absence of C1q in either the CD4+ or CD8+ compartment (n = 15, P 0.3). complement activation occurs in vivo after WNV infection. previous studies suggest other pathogenic flaviviruses activate complement. differences in the C3 and C4 activity between naive and WNV-infected mice were statistically significant (P 0.05). erythrocyte hemolysis assay of serum samples from naive wild-type and C3/ mice and WNV-infected wild-type mice. mice in all groups showed clinical signs of infection including weight loss, hunching, fur ruffling, and decreased activity. but mice deficient in any individual complement activation pathway were more vulnerable to infection. 83% of wild-type C57BL/6 mice succumbed to infection. no statistically significant decrease in mean time to death was observed for C4/ (10.3 0.2 d), C1q/ (11.7 0.2 d), or fD/ (11.0 0.2 d) mice. deficiencies in all complement activation pathways resulted in increased mortality after WNV infection. viremia was below the limit of detection by direct plaque assay in all samples. viremia peaked at day 2 after infection and decreased over the next several days. on day 8 after infection 57% (8 of 14) of fB/ mice still had measurable infectious virus in the spleen, whereas it was no longer detectable in wild-type mice. at peak of viral replication in the spleen, 120,000-fold lower levels of WNV RNA were detected. study shows draining lymph nodes are early site of WNV replication. viral burden in the inguinal lymph nodes was measured by quantitative RT-PCR. by 3 d after infection fourfold less WNV RNA was found in the draining inguinal lymph nodes of C1q and C4/ mice. 73% of wild-type mice had infectious WNV in the spinal cord at this time point. a slightly different pattern of infection was observed in the brain. earlier viral invasion was observed in all complement-deficient mice. emia was observed at any time point after infection in C1q/, fB/, or fD/ mice. the only variation among complement-deficient mice occurred in C4/ mice. a deficiency of C3 results in a delayed clearance of WNV from the spleen. 80% (12 of 15) of wild-type spleen samples were positive for infectious virus at day 4 after infection. only 30% (4 of 12) from C4/ mice had infectious virus. decreased WNV burden in spleens was not predicted. distinct patterns of WNV invasion and accumulation in the spinal cord were observed in C1q/, C4/, fD/, and fB/ mice. in the absence of either fB or C4, however, WNV was detected in a subset of spinal cord samples 2 d earlier. fD/ mice had 30-fold higher levels of WNV in the brain than C1q/ mice on day 4 after infection. levels of infectious WNV continued to rise in wild-type mice. a deficiency in the alternative pathway results in earlier viral entry and accumulation. we assessed the kinetics of specific anti-WNV IgM and IgG production in C3/ mice (20) in wild-type mice WNV-specific IgM was detected by day 4 after infection (Fig. 6 A), and WNV-specific IgG was detected by day 6 after infection (Fig. 6 B). serum samples from wild-type, C1q/, C4/, fD/, and fB/ mice were collected at the indicated time points. the isotype of WNV-specific IgG responses (C) was analyzed on day 8 after infection. CD8+ cells expressed IFN expression in both wild-type (P = 0.0007) and C1q/ mice (P = 0.03) this increase in IFN expression was not observed in CD4+ or CD8+ splenocytes from WNV-infected C4/, fD/, or fB/ mice. flow cytometry profiles show CD3+CD8+ T cells in the brain after WNV infection in wild-type or complement-deficient mice. asterisks indicate differences from wild type that are statistically significant. differences in priming of adaptive immune responses to WNV were observed in mice lacking individual components of all three pathways of complement activation. Deficiencies in the alternative pathway were associated with decreased splenic infection and significant deficits in both B and T cell responses against WNV. all pathways of complement activation are required to control WNV infection. virologic experiments suggest complement limits viral spread and facilitates clearance of WNV within the CNS. increased viremia in C1q/ and C4/ mice may be secondary to depressed levels of antiviral IgM in these mice. the relatively low viral neutralizing activity of serum complement in mice may be caused by the reduced function of the mouse classical pathway C5 convertase. q, infectious virus was not detected in the spleen, and 100,000-fold less WNV RNA was measured on day 6 after infection. fewer spleen samples contained less infectious virus than those of wild-type animals. fB/ mice exhibit normal B cell priming to T cell\u2013independent and T cell\u2013dependent antigens. activation of the alternative pathway is not required for priming the antiviral IgM against WNV. ose individuals to HIV-1 (49), HSV-2 (7), severe acute respiratory syndrome (50), and chronic hepatitis B infection (51). we speculate that the lectin pathway may have an essential role in priming antiviral T cell immunity. a fully functional complement cascade is clearly important for controlling and clearing WNV. severe WNV infection in humans, which occurs infrequently (1/150), could be more common in patients with dysfunctional complement responses. all pathways of complement activation are required to control WNV infection. virologic experiments suggest complement limits viral spread and facilitates clearance of WNV within the CNS. most complement-deficient mice had near wild-type levels of viral RNA in serum throughout the time course. the relatively low viral neutralizing activity of serum complement in mice may be caused by the reduced function of the mouse classical pathway C5 convertase. antibody-mediated protection from WNV disease was not significantly attenuated in C1q/ or C4/ mice. alternative pathway activation during initial phases of infection could induce inflammatory mediators that facilitate viral blood-brain barrier crossing. NV RNA was detected in the spleen and draining inguinal lymph node. previous in vitro studies showed complement and antiviral IgM enhanced WNV infection in macrophages. but prior studies with secreted mice showed normal WNV splenic infection. fB/ mice exhibit normal B cell priming to T cell\u2013independent and T cell\u2013dependent antigens. lectin pathway could play an important role in priming antiviral IgM against WNV. Efficient CD8+ CTL responses are critical for development of WNV immunity (16, 17) mice with the greatest mortality (i.e., C4/ and fB/) had associated T cell activation and trafficking deficits. previous studies with soluble antigens suggested that C1q-mediated immune complex trapping contributed to T cell priming. complement activation plays a critical role in innate recognition and neutralization of pathogens in vivo. a fully functional complement cascade is clearly important for controlling and clearing WNV. severe WNV infection in humans could be more common in patients with dysfunctional complement responses. mice were inoculated subcutaneously with 102 PFUs diluted in Hanks balanced salt solution and 1% heat inactivated FBS. sheep erythrocytes (Colorado Serum Co.) were coated with rabbit anti\u2013sheep erythrocyte IgG at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. levels of C3 were determined using normal human serum (Complement Technologies) the 50% value of hemolytic complement activity (CH50) was determined as described previously (65). serum samples were collected from naive or WNV-infected mice on day 2 after infection. viral RNA was extracted from lymph node and spleen tissue homogenates. values were normalized to the level of 18S RNA as determined by fluorogenic RT-PCR. soluble WNV E-protein with a COOH-terminal hexa-histidine tag was purified. WNV-specific antibody response was determined using a previously described high-throughput flow cytometry-based neutralization assay. splenocytes were harvested from wild-type and complement-deficient mice. 106 splenocytes were stimulated with 50 ng/ml PMA (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 M Ionomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) cells were harvested and stained with either FITC-conjugated anti-CD4 (L3T4) or anti-CD8 (Ly-2) antibody (BD PharMingen), and stained with AlexaFluor 647\u2013conjugated rat anti\u2013mouse IFN leukocytes from three brains were pooled, washed twice, and stained for CD4+ or CD8+ T cells with anti-CD3 (17A2) and anti-CD8 (Ly-2) or anti-CD4 (L3T4) antibodies (BD PharMingen) after washing, cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS. the congenic wild-type C57BL/6 control mice were purchased commercially. all mice were housed in the pathogen-free BSL3 mouse facility at Washington University School of Medicine. lytic complement activity (CH50) was determined as described previously (65). serum samples were collected from naive or WNV-infected C57BL/6 mice on day 2 after infection, diluted in PBS, boiled in SDS reducing sample buffer, and subjected to SDS PAGE. a soluble WNV E-protein with a COOH-terminal hexa-histidine (His6) tag was purified from baculovirus-infected Hi5 insect cells by nickel-affinity chromatography. plates were incubated with fourfold serial dilutions of heat-inactivated serum samples overnight at 4\u00b0C. the adjusted OD was determined by subtracting the OD450 value for each sample on blocked control wells. splenocytes were harvested from wild-type and complement-deficient mice. splenocytes were lysed with ACK lysis buffer (0.15 M NH4Cl, 10 mM KHCO3, 0.1 mM Na2EDTA) and splenocytes were counted. cells were harvested and stained with either FITC-conjugated anti-CD4 (L3T4) or anti-CD8 (Ly-2) antibody (BD PharMingen) cells were then washed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.5% saponin, and stained with AlexaFluor 647\u2013conjugated rat anti\u2013mouse IFN- antibody or rat IgG1 isotype control (BD 4+ or CD8+ T cells with anti-CD3 (17A2) and anti-CD8 (Ly-2) or anti-CD4 (L3T4) antibodies (BD PharMingen) were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS. cells were analyzed by FACscan (Becton Dickinson) with cellQuest software."}
