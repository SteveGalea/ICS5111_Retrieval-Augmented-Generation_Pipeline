{"summary": "highly pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) (subtype H5N1) is the most significant newly emerging pandemic disease since HIV/AIDS. it has killed millions of poultry in countries throughout Asia, Europe, and Africa. 402 humans have died from it in sixteen countries according to WHO data as of January 2015. the initial HPAI H5N1 outbreaks in Vietnam represent an ideal opportunity to adapt and test a CAS-convergence model. we hypothesized a positive association between the presence of HPAI outbreaks in poultry at the commune level and co-location of intensive and extensive systems. a commune in Viet Nam is thus the third level administrative subdivision. for simplicity we will henceforth use the term \u201ccommune\u201d to refer to the smallest administrative unit whether it is a commune, town, or ward. we included risk factors documented in previous work. urbanization is a non-linear characteristic, using household-level variables such as water and sanitation services. he found evidence that increased diversity in water supply sources and sanitation infrastructure were associated with higher incidences of HPAI. other studies have mapped the relative urban nature of a place. nearly 75% of zoonotic diseases are associated with land-cover and land-use changes (LCLUC) peri-urbanization and agricultural diversification often result in more diverse and fragmented landscapes. landscape fragmentation produces ecotones, defined as abrupt edges or transitions zones between different ecological systems. Intensive and extensive systems in Viet Nam have their own fairly well defined flock sizes. a diversity index of the relative number of intensive and extensive systems of poultry- raising can better estimate the effect of such co-location. studies show differences in rural/urban nature of communities across space and time. but they have been limited to small- to medium-scale observational studies. the best known model of peri-urbanization is the concept of desakota. landscape fragmentation produces ecotones, defined as abrupt edges or transitions zones between different ecological systems. fragmentation of natural habitat tends to interrupt and degrade natural processes, including interspecies interactions that regulate densities of otherwise opportunistic species. research attempts to link land-use diversity to final health endpoints in humans or livestock. Intensive and extensive systems in Viet Nam have their own fairly well defined flock sizes. a diversity index of the relative number of intensive and extensive systems of poultry- raising can better estimate the effect of such co-location. a diversity index of the relative number of intensive and extensive systems can better estimate the effect of such co-location. i-Simpson diversity indices have been used to measure land-use diversity. the area under the last class was calculated as the difference between the total area and the sum of the first four classes. chicken, duck and geese densities were calculated based on commune area. previous studies have shown that the extent of rice cultivation is a risk factor, mainly due to its association with free ranging ducks acting as scavengers [10]. we used percentage of land under rice cultivation as a measure of extent. some studies have shown that at local scales, the slope of the terrain was significantly correlated with reservoir species dominance. CTI is a function of both the slope and the upstream contributing area per unit width orthogonal to the flow direction. households classified by source, type, cultivation area for by crop type; and farming equipment by purpose. compound topographical index (CTI) data were generated using the SRTM 90 meter digital Elevation Models. most of the variables were found to follow a log-normal distribution and a log-transform was used on them. we then examined the bi-variate correlations between all the risk factors (or their log-transform, as the case may be) Boosted regression trees were performed to predict the probability of HPAI H5N1 occurrence and determine the relative influence of each risk factor to the HPAI H5N1 occurrence. the method is widely used for species distribution modeling where only the sites of occurrence of the species are known. in the GLMM models we used 10 sets of training and test points for cross-validation, a tree complexity of 5, a learning rate of 0.01 and a bag fraction of 0.5. we chose to eliminate predictors that were highly correlated with other predictors and to make log-transform where needed. the distance between the commune and the nearest: a) lake and b) river was used as an indicator of transportation infrastructure. the densities of chicken were calculated based on commune area [15, 19, 37, 49]. previous studies have shown that the extent of rice cultivation is a risk factor. CTI has been used in the study of other infectious and non-infectious diseases. some studies have shown that at local scales, the slope of the terrain was significantly correlated with reservoir species dominance. about three-fourths of all of the country\u2019s households are included. the contents of the survey include number of households in major production activities, population, labor classified by sex, age, qualification, employment and major income source. agriculture, forestry and aquaculture land used by households classified by source, type, cultivation area for by crop type. data pre-processing and collinearity Prior to risk factor analysis we cleaned the data by identifying illogical values for all variables and either assigning a missing value to them or adjusting the values. most of the variables were found to follow a log-normal distribution and a log-transform was used on them. some risk factors were then eliminated from consideration when |r| 0.5 (r is the Pearson correlation coefficient) the limit of autocorrelation of the response variable was obtained from the range of the spatial correlogram (h) [66]. to determine which predictor variables to include in the two models, we conducted logistic regression modeling separately for each of them one by one but included the autoregressive term each time. the sequential process allows trees to be fitted iteratively through a forward stage-wise procedure in the boosting model. in our model we used 10 sets of training and test points for cross-validation, a tree complexity of 5, a learning rate of 0.01 and a bag fraction of 0.5. unadjusted coefficients for the final set of predictors based on autologistic regression were found. land-use diversity, chicken density, poultry flock size diversity and distance to national highway were found to have significant associations across five of the six wave-place combinations. the predictive power of the GLMM models, as measured by the AUC, is very good with AUC values ranging from 0.802 to 0.952. the predictive power of the national models is very good, with AUC values ranging from 0.737 to 0.914. these values are higher than those reported for Wave 1 (AUC = 0.69) and Wave 2 (AUC = 0.77) at the national level. previous studies indicated the duck density was an important predictor. 0.499 0.02 0.37 0.04 12 Shortest distance to

more significant in the deltas than for the country as a whole. the unadjusted Relative Risk (RR) of peri-urban areas was 1.41 and 1.60 for Waves 1 and 2 respectively. the GLMM model indicated that land-use diversity highly influenced HPAI H5N1 at the national level in Wave 2. both the GLMM and BRT models indicated that the diversity of chicken flock-size had a strong association with HPAI H5N1 in all places. this was generally found to be true at the delta levels with some exceptions. urbanicity and shortest distance to nearest town risk factors serve as rough proxies for reporting/detection efficiency. previous studies have tended to use human population density as a proxy for this purpose. but we acknowledge that a categorical variable such as urbanicity may provide less sensitivity than a continuous variable such as human population density in this specific context. study attempted both to associate HPAI H5N1 with degree of urbanicity and to determine the features of periurban areas that place them at risk. urbanization had no significant association with HPAI H5N1. this may be due to the fact that the deltas are more homogenous in terms of urbanization than the country as whole. national census data (particularly agricultural censuses) compiled at local levels of administration provide valuable information that are not available from remotely sensed data (such as poultry densities) or require a large amount of labor to map at national to larger scales (land-use diversity) future studies could examine the correlation between a census-based metric with metrics derived from remote sensing. in the deltas we commonly found only chicken density, duck flock size diversity and annual precipitation to be significant. this suggests dynamics of risk at the commune level are strongly dependent on the spatial range of analysis, consistent with another study in the mekong delta [61] convergence represents the coalescence in time and space of processes associated with land-cover and land-use changes. project results question whether urban/rural land-use dichotomy is useful when large areas and parts of the population are caught between the two."}
