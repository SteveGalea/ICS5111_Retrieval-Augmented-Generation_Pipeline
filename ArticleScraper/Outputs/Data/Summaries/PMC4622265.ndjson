{"summary": "specimens collected from hospitalized patients suspected of having MERS on the basis of epidemiologic history linked to the Middle East. the index patient, a 68-year-old man engaged in farming-related business, reported that he had traveled to Bahrain on April 24, 2015, the United Arab Emirates on April 29\u201330, Saudi Arabia on May 1\u20132 and Qatar on May 2\u20133 before returning to south Korea on May 4. 78-year-old man had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and cholangiocarcinoma. he had shared a hospital room with the index patient and had been within 2 meters of him for 4 hours on may 16. the index patient did not undergo any aerosol-generating procedures, but a severe cough developed. sample index patient (day 2 after illness onset) upE, Ct ORF1a, Ct upE, Ct ORF1a, Ct Sputum 18.61 19.32 26.23 26.63 Nasal swab 29.34 29.58 ND 36.64 Nasopharyngeal aspirate 29.35 31.45 NT NT Serum 34.81 35.50 ND Urine ND ND 34.34 ND *Ct, cycle threshold; real-time reverse transcription PCR results for sputum samples serially collected from 3 patients infected with middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, south Korea, 2015*. patient 1 (index patient) patient 2 Patient 3 Days after illness onset upE, Ct ORF1a, Ct Days after illness onset upE. the tree was constructed by using the general time reversible plus gamma model of RAxML version 8.8.0 software (10) and FigTree version 1.4.2 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree) we isolated the MERS-CoV strain from the vero cells after inoculation by using the sputum from patient 2. the index patient had no history of potential exposure to camels, bats, or their excreta. phylogenetic analysis showed that the isolate from south Korea was closely related to the MERS-CoV strains isolated in Saudi Arabia in 2015. use of specimens in addition to those obtained from the respiratory tract to define the kinetics of MERS-CoV."}
