{"summary": "most screening tests rely on crude or purified Echinococcus granulosus hydatid cyst fluid. the use of highly pure and highly pure antigens produced by chemical synthesis offers considerable advantages. a single peptide cannot provide sufficient diagnostic sensitivity. pooling several peptide antigens improved sensitivity. combinations of several peptides may lead the way to new diagnostic tests that replace conventional immunodiagnosis of echinococcosis. the availability of an increasing number of pathogen genomes is boosting basic research as well as applied science. annotated genomes and proteomes are available for some of the medically important protozoan pathogens, such as Plasmodium species and some Kinetoplastida species. these prediction algorithms require full length amino acid sequences with complete N- and C-termini. the majority of proteins generally display well defined three dimensional structures, which is mostly globular. the intrinsically unstructured regions (IUR) lack a well defined three dimensional structure displaying an extended conformation. the importance of alveolar echinococcosis is not represented by the number of reported cases but rather by the severity of the disease in the individual patient [24]. standard diagnostic tests for human echinococcosis, AE as well as CE imply imaging techniques such as ultrasonography, x-ray and computer tomography. a single serum and 2 pools made of 5 sera each were used for testing peptide reactivity in ELISA. 44 sera from E. multilocularis- and 35 sera from E. granulosus-infected patients were used. all sera were sampled prior to any therapeutic intervention. us were retrieved from NCBI Entrez Protein Database on October 16, 2007. protein sequences were analyzed using TMHMM II [18] for prediction of transmembrane domains, GPI-SOM [19] for prediction of glycosylphosphatidylinisotol (GPI) anchor signals, and PSORT II [17] for prediction of protein subcellular localization. peptides were produced by Fmoc solid phase synthesis (Alta Bioscience, University of Birmingham, UK) length of the peptides ranged between 24 and 30 amino acids. biotin was required to bind peptides to a streptavidin-coated solid phase. antigen B8/1- and antigen B8/2-sequences showed 86% identity. antigen longD8-9 coincided with the region of a previously published epitope EVKYFFER [29]. microarray platform was used for screening in silico selected peptides for reactivity with patients' sera. the low-density peptide microarray featured two blocks, each containing 45 Echinococcus peptide spots. slides were washed for 35 minutes in assay buffer and rinsed with deionized water before drying with compressed air. slides were scanned at 532 and 635 nm using a GenePix 4100A microarray scanner (Bucher Biotec AG, Basel, Switzerland) the plates were washed and incubated for one hour with human sera diluted 1200 in assay buffer (100 l/well), followed by a final wash. wells were then incubated for 15 minutes with 100 l of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma product number N 4645) the cut-off was determined by the mean A405nm of fifty blood donor samples plus 2 standard deviations. Sensitivity and cross-reactive behavior was tested with 30 echinococcosis sera and 15 sera from various helminth and amoeba infections that had previously shown cross-reactivity with the single peptides. sequences of Echinococcus multilocularis and E. granulosus were retrieved from NCBI Entrez Protein Database on October 16, 2007. the protein sequences were analyzed using TMHMM II [18] for prediction of transmembrane domains, GPI-SOM [19] for prediction of glycosylphosphatidylinisotol anchor signals, and PSORT II [17] for prediction of protein subcellular localization. protein sequences were subjected to prediction of coiled-coil stability by STABLECOIL. predicted regions of high predicted CC stability or antigenicity were favored. peptides were selected to start and end with a hydrophilic or neutral amino acid. synthetic peptides were modified by carboxy-terminal amidation. the length of extended peptides ranged between 40 and 47 residues. the length of extended peptides was identical to those of the microarray peptides. 8-9 covered the central part of the protein (amino acids 33\u201374). in the overlap of 26 amino acids, three amino acids differed. microarray A microarray platform was used for screening in silico selected peptides. the low-density peptide microarray featured two blocks, each containing 45 Echinococcus peptide spots. a spotting control allowing positioning of grid for analysis (unrelated, TAMRA-labeled peptide), a control for serological detection (human IgG) and a blank (spotting solution) ELISA 96-well plates (NUNC Immobilizer Streptavidin) were pre-washed three times using an ELISA plate washer. they were coated overnight at 4\u00b0C with 100 l/well of synthetic peptide. after washing, the plates were blocked for one hour with 150 l/well of assay buffer. the cut-off value was determined by the mean of the blood donor samples plus two standard deviations. echinococcosis sera and 15 sera from various helminth and amoeba infections had previously shown cross-reactivity with the single peptides. in total, 45 peptide sequences from 11 proteins were chosen to be chemically synthesized and spotted onto microarray. 31 peptides derived from E. multilocularis and 14 from E. granulosus were screened for diagnostic potential on a microarray platform. 17 peptides that reacted above the cut-off determined from blood donor sera were listed in table 2.

Peptide longD8-9 was positive with 1/12 cysticercosis, 1/8 strongyloidiasis and 1/10 schistosomiasis sera. Peptide longD12 was positive with 1/8 strongyloidiasis, 1/10 toxocariasis, 1/10 fascioliasis and 3/10 schistosomiasis sera. cross-reactions with Taenia, Strongyloides and filaria are also seen in the cut-off of mixW was 0.352, which is in the same range as the cut-off of one of its components, namely longD12. the theoretical sensitivity indeed increased from 57% to 70%, but specificity decreased to 82% (table 4). 0 0 1 1 Em-45 0 1 1 Em-47 0 0 1 1 Em-53 1 0 0 1 1 Eg-1 1 0 1 1 Eg-2 1 0 0 1 0 Eg-3 1 0 0 1 0 Eg-11 1 0 0 0 Eg-13 1 0 0 1 0 Eg-14 1 1 0 1 1 Eg-22 1 0 0 1 1 1 Eg-24 1 0 0 1 1 proteins were retrieved from NCBI Entrez Protein Database including redundancies. these proteins were isolated from metacestode or protoscolex tissue. no information on developmental stage was provided.
