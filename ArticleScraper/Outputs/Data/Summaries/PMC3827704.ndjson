{"summary": "this delicate balance from normal homeostasis is tipped toward inflammatory injury in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute lung injury (ALI) and pneumonia. in this review, we highlight emerging discoveries regarding selective regulation of protein degradation in the lung by the ubiquitin (Ub)\u2013proteasome system. ubiquitin is loaded onto E1 ligases in an ATP-dependent fashion, then transferred to E2 ligases. the same E2 ligase can bind many target substrate proteins, which in turn can ubiquitinate several target substrate proteins. substrate proteins based on substrate degron motifs usually consisting of a post-translational modification, such as phosphorylation. LUBAC (HOIL-1L, HOIP, and SHARPIN) changes the cellular localization and activity of substrates, including RIP and NEMO for NF-B signaling. the HECT (homologous to the E6-AP carboxy terminus) domain\u2013containing proteins are a smaller E3 ligase family. there is also a family of \u201cU-box\u201d E3 ligases. the linear ubiquitination complex (LUBAC) is another multisubunit E3 ligase that polyubiquitinates substrates for sorting and/or degradation. each FBP causes degradation of a specific set of target proteins by unique degron recognition. sixty-eight FBPs have been identified in humans, designated FBXL (containing a leucine-rich domain), FBXW (containing neither leucine-rich nor WD-40 domains) (11) ubiquitin is loaded onto E1 ligases in an ATP-dependent fashion, then transferred to E2 ligases. the same E2 ligase can bind many target substrate proteins, which in turn can ubiquitinate several target substrate proteins. linear ubiquitination via the K48 residue on Ub changes the cellular localization and activity of substrates, including RIP and NEMO for NF-B signaling. the system is hierarchical, with about 40 E2 enzymes, and more than 1,000 E3 ligases described in mammalian cells. the HECT (homologous to the E6-AP carboxy terminus) domain\u2013containing proteins are a smaller E3 ligase family. the linear ubiquitination complex (LUBAC) is another multisubunit E3 ligase that polyubiquitinates substrates for sorting and/or degradation by adduction of chains of Ub monomers joined end-to-end (8). sixty-eight FBPs have been identified in humans, designated FBXL (containing a leucine-rich domain), FBXW (containing neither leucine-rich nor WD-40 domains) each FBP causes degradation of a specific set of target proteins by unique degron recognition. vHL protein and HIF-1 signaling axis was described initially in vHL disease. affected patients have polycythemia, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and respiratory insufficiency, attributed to increased HIF-1 signaling. proteasome becomes more specialized in setting of infection or inflammation. human adenovirus creates two E3 ligase proteins that cause degradation of the p53 protein, allowing production of viral proteins and genetic material without p53-mediated host cell apoptosis. the coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome possesses a Ub-like protein that increases pathogenicity. epithelial sodium channel activity regulates apical Na+ entry into the cell. vHL protein also controls edema clearance during hypoxia. reactive oxygen species participate in the regulation of the Na-K-ATPase via PKC. LUBAC has been described to have an important role in regulating inflammation. LUBAC is now known to be part of the TNF receptor signaling complex. LUBAC also targets IL-1, CD40 ligand, and several Toll-like receptors. a 2010 study of an amish family with a multiorgan inflammatory\u2013autoimmune syndrome identified an autosomal recessive mutation in the Itch E3 ligase (33), almost completely recapitulating the disease phenotype initially observed in knockout mice. the cytoplasmic Miz1 suppresses LPS- or TNF-induced production of proinflammatory cytokines through inhibition of JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) activation. itch and Cbl-b seem to play a role in maintaining immune tolerance in different effector arms of the T-cell system. MID1 targets protein phosphatase-2A (PP2A), an endogenous inhibitor of cytokine signaling that deactivates NF-B. with tobacco exposure, some smokers have a sustained inflammatory phenotype. -33 is a strong inflammatory activator during asthma and ALI through the receptor ST2L. FBXL19 decreased ST2 and reduced inflammation while improving survival in animal models of ALI. depletion of the proinflammatory FBP FBXO3 restores FBXL2 protein levels, improves survival, lowers cytokine release, and lessens inflammation histologically. FBXL2 destabilizes proteins critical to cell cycle progression. SKP2 degrades protective p27 and increases tissue invasiveness. increased p27 in biopsy specimens is robustly correlated with shorter survival. hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 is hydroxylated through the action of prolyl hydroxylase domain protein-2 (PHD2) during hypoxia, however, PHD2 activity (and therefore HIF-1 hydroxylation) is decreased, and vHL no longer prevents transcription. proteasomes in lung fluid are only shown to have the 20S subunit and cleave proteins without requirement for E3 ligases for protein-specific recognition or ubiquitination. extracellular proteasomes are increased in the setting of acute infection and inflammation, and may play a role in antigen presentation. the coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome possesses a Ub-like protein that increases pathogenicity. proteasome inhibitor pretreatment reduced viral replication and improved survival in mice (19), implicating some role for the UPS in severe acute respiratory syndrome. human adenovirus creates two E3 ligase proteins that cause degradation of the p53 protein, allowing production of viral proteins and genetic material without p53-mediated host cell apoptosis. the coronavirus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome possesses a Ub-like protein that increases pathogenicity. proteasome inhibitor pretreatment reduced viral replication and improved survival in mice. reactive oxygen species participate in the regulation of the Na-K-ATPase via PKC and a member of the LUBAC, HOIL-1L, which leads to impaired lung fluid clearance. vHL protein also controls edema clearance during hypoxia, where it mediates degradation of Na-K-ATPase. reactive oxygen species participate in the regulation of the Na-K-ATPase via PKC and a member of the LUBAC, HOIL-1L. the steady state of both the epithelial sodium channel and Na-K-ATPase are highly regulated by the UPS to critically maintain epithelial function. LUBAC is now known to be part of the TNF receptor signaling complex. LUBAC also targets IL-1, CD40 ligand, and several Toll-like receptors. SHARPIN mutant mice develop a proliferative dermatitis. the cytoplasmic Miz1 suppresses LPS- or TNF-induced production of proinflammatory cytokines through inhibition of JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) activation (34). it has been reported that the HECT domain\u2013containing E3 ligase Mule catalyzes TNF-\u2013induced Miz1 K48-ubiquitination degradation. MID1 targets protein phosphatase-2A (PP2A), an endogenous inhibitor of cytokine signaling that deactivates NF-B. MID1 knockdown suppressed allergic inflammation in vivo in mice and in vitro in human lung cells. itch knockout mice fail to develop tolerance to ovalbumin antigen-specific immunomodulatory therapy. another E3 ligase, midline 1 (MID1), is up-regulated after antigen stimulation. MID1 knockdown suppressed allergic inflammation in vivo in mice and in vitro. E3 ligase Cbl-b down-regulates TLR signaling, with Cbl-b deficiency potentiating the inflammatory response (46). IL-33 is a strong inflammatory activator during asthma and ALI through the receptor ST2L. ectopically expressed FBXL19 decreased ST2 and reduced inflammation while improving survival in animal models of ALI. FBXW7 is a p53-dependent tumor suppressor that facilitates degradation of oncoproteins. SKP2 is considered a proneoplastic factor that degrades protective p27 and increases tissue invasiveness. increased p27 levels in biopsy specimens are associated with increased metastasis. bortezomib has emerged as an effective agent in the treatment of multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. only one other proteasome inhibitor has been approved by the FDA for use in humans. the first such compound to be tested in humans is MLN4924. this drug targets the NEDD8 activating enzyme required for activation of the Cullin\u2013RING proteins. this drug globally suppresses ubiquitination through Cullin\u2013RING ligases.
