{"summary": "quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) is the most reliable and easy to perform technique to measure the expression level of a selected gene of interest (GOI) qRT-PCR is fast and the sensitivity of the method allows precise quantification of minimal differences in expression across a wide dynamic range even when working with limited amounts of starting material. several variables associated with the different steps of qRT-PCR experimental procedures can lead to considerable inter-sample variation. a reference gene for use in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was selected [9] but this study was based on the analysis of the standard deviation of cycle threshold (Ct) and not specifically designed algorithms. some attempts to identify gene expression markers by qRT-PCR in order to develop blood tests have been reported for prion diseases. qRT-PCR optimisation was performed using pooled cDNA samples. all candidate reference genes were expressed in ovine whole blood. highest expression was obtained with ACTB, B2M and RPL19. lowest expressed gene was GYPC. geNorm analysis table 1 reports expression stability values (M) of the candidate reference genes in control, disease-stressed and combined sheep groups. high M values indicate increased gene expression variability. most stable genes should exhibit M values 1.5. 0.344 SDHA 0.667 ACTB 0.596 RPL19 0.361 ACTB 0.701 G6PD 0.666 B2M 0.362 B2M 0.720 GAPDH 0.681 ACTB 0.377 G6PD 0.740 GYPC 0.698 GYPC 0.412 GYPC 0.848 RPL19 0.746 TFRC 0.455 RPL19 1.000 B2M 0.760 G6PD 0.486 HPRT 1.188 HPRT geNorm measures the pairwise variation between two sequential NFs with an increasing number of reference genes. a cut-off value of 0.15 is usually considered acceptable; it indicates that the control gene combination ensures satisfactory stability. lower values are assigned to the most stable genes. gene symbol Stability value () SDHA 0.068 YWHAZ 0.046 SDHA 0.093 YWHAZ 0.125 GAPDH 0.064 YWHAZ 0.096 HPRT 0.132 SDHA 0.188 ACTB 0.99 B2M 0.146 ACTB 0.155 B2M 0.146 ACTB 0.167 RPL19 0.155 B2M 0.25 ACTB 0.174 G6PD 0.248 G6PD 0.184 GYPC 0.201 GYPC 0.201 G SDHA and YWHAZ can be considered the most stably expressed genes in ovine whole blood. stability appears to be reliable as it was affected neither by disease status alone nor in association with heat stress. geNorm indicated SDHA/YWHAZ as the best reference gene combination in the control and disease-stressed sheep. a large study in which 526 human whole blood samples represented healthy individuals and six disease groups. in humans, GYPC expression is considerably higher in erythroid lineage cells than in non-erythroid cells. in sheep, GYPC expression is significantly higher in erythroid lineage cells than in non-erythroid cells. qRT-PCR primers for 5758 genes of 26 organisms were deposited under Ovis aries. qRT-PCR optimisation was performed using pooled cDNA samples. qRT-PCR optimisation was performed using pooled cDNA samples in parallel with sheep genomic DNA. the highest expression was obtained with ACTB, B2M and RPL19. the lowest expressed gene was GYPC (mean Ct, 27.50) for all analysed genes, the relative standard curve gave correlation coefficients greater than 0.985. AZ represented the most suitable gene combinations in the control, disease-stressed and combined sheep groups. gene expression stability analyzed by the geNorm software in disease-stressed sheep. gene expression stability analyzed by geNorm software in combined control and disease-stressed sheep. NormFinder ranks a set of candidate genes according to their expression stability measure. lower values are assigned to the most stable genes. SDHA and YWHAZ in the top positions with stability values of 0.093 and 0.096, respectively, followed by ACTB (value = 0.099). TFRC and PGK1 are equally defined as the least reliable controls by both software and in all sheep groups. geNorm focuses on pairwise comparisons of reference gene expression in the experimental samples. we therefore selected the candidate reference genes on the basis of differences in their physiological functions. disease-stressed animals were sampled and analysed twice in order to monitor gene stability in disease-stressed sheep. HPRT expression stability was evaluated only in the lung and pulmonary artery of brainstem death and control sheep. but it performed poorly as reference in both tissues on separate and combined analyses. in sheep, B2M is outperformed by other genes and demonstrates suboptimal suitability as reference gene in whole blood. a distinctive point of our study is the major effort put into primer design with the aim to validate only oligos spanning at least one intron. this aspect has been neglected in the previous works on reference gene validation in sheep, probably because of the lack of ovine genomic DNA sequences available in the public databases. the blood samples from disease-stressed sheep were collected twice. the first sampling was carried out in august, when the environmental temperature was 35 \u00b0C, and the second in September with an environmental temperature of 26 \u00b0C. the blood samples were immediately transferred to the lab and submitted to nucleic acid isolation. pooled cDNAs were then used in preliminary experiments to evaluate primer performance and specificity. the expression profile of the selected genes was analysed in each cDNA sample separately. ons and their specificity was tested using ovine pooled cDNA and genomic DNA in preliminary PCR assays. primers information including sequences, product size, putative exon position, estimated size of the amplicon, efficiency of RT-PCR (E) and correlation coefficients (R2). Table 3 summarises primers information including sequences, product size, putative exon position, estimated size of the amplicon, and correlation coefficients (R2). PCR reactions were performed in a 25-L final volume containing 2 Brilliant II SYBR Green Master Mix (Stratagene), 300\u2013900 nM of each specific primer and 1 L of cDNA. the dissociation step eliminates non-specific fluorescence signal and ensures accurate quantification of the desired product. qRT-PCR data were analysed for reference genes expression stability using two different statistical algorithms. raw quantification cycle (Ct) values were converted to relative quantities using the comparative Ct method as input data for the two applets. purity, concentration and integrity of total RNA were assessed using two independent techniques. RNA purity and concentration were assessed using a nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GYPC); glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD); ribosomal protein L19 (RPL19); and glycophorin C (GYPC) other primers were designed using Primer3 software [32] by aligning ovine sequences available in GenBank with bovine and human homologous genes. RT-PCR All PCR reactions were performed in a 25-L final volume containing 2 Brilliant II SYBR Green Master Mix (Stratagene), 300\u2013900 nM of each specific primer and 1 L of cDNA. min at 95 \u00b0C for polymerase activation, 30 s at 56\u201360 \u00b0C, and 40 s at 72 \u00b0C for elongation. dissociation step eliminates non-specific fluorescence signal. melting curve was produced to confirm single gene-specific peaks. qRT-PCR data were analysed for reference genes expression stability. studies have been carried out to identify reliable reference genes in specific tissues in various species. in sheep, analyses of expression stability of candidate reference genes are limited to a restricted range of tissues. peripheral whole blood certainly represents the best tissue for in vivo test development since collection is non-invasive and easy to perform."}
