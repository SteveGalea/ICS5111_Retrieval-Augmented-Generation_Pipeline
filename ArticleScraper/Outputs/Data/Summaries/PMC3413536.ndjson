{"summary": "the results of the present study were to find out whether plasma concentrations of vitamin D and vitamin D are different in patients with dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) the results The plasma concentrations of vitamin D and MBL were assessed in 48 DF cases, 45 DHF cases and 20 apparently healthy controls. the outcome of DENV infection is determined by multiple factors including viral virulence, host genetics and host immune responses. preexisting antibodies and cross reactive T cell responses induced by the primary infection is believed to exacerbate the disease during secondary infection. MBL is a pattern recognition molecule that recognizes specific sugar molecules present on the surface of microorganisms including DENV [23,24] Alleles of MBL2 gene that are associated with higher concentrations of functional MBL have been shown to be associated with thrombocytopenia in dengue infected patients. chills, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, retro orbital pain and rash were reported equally in DF and DHF cases. Thrombocytopenia was significantly over represented in DHF cases as compared to DF cases (P 0.001). median count of platelets was significantly lower in DHF cases (P = 0.020) in 21 (46.7%) cases, hematuria was observed in six (13.3%), gum bleeding in seven (15.6%), conjunctival hemorrhage in one (2.2%) and epistaxis in one (2.2%). plasma leakage was observed in 9 (20%) patients either ascites (n = 5) and/or as pleural effusion (n = 4). no fatality was observed in the cases included in the study. vitamin D concentrations were not significantly different between primary DF and primary DHF cases (P > 0.050) when comparisons were made between primary DF and Secondary DF or primary DHF and secondary DHF, vitamin D levels were not different (P > 0.050) a cutoff value of 500 ng/ml was used to define subjects with or without MBL deficiency. 40% of primary DHF cases, 25% of DF cases and 35% of healthy controls had deficiency of MBL. 14.2% of secondary DHF patients had an almost complete deficiency of MBL. males were over represented in both DF and DHF patients. median age of DHF cases (23.0 years) was significantly lower than that of DF cases (29.5 years) a 7 (14.6) 9 (20.0) 0.670 Nausea/Vomitting 0 12 (26.7) 0.001 Abdominal pain 0 5 (11.1) 0.023 Retro orbital pain 1 (2.1) 4 (8.9) 0.190 Rash 9 (18.8) 9 (20.0) 0.950 Thrombocytopenia 28 (58.3) 41 (91.1) 0.001 Platelet count* 67000 (13000\u2013330000) 38500 (5000\u2013150000) 0.002 * 25-hydroxy vitamin D concentrations were expressed in ng/ml and plotted in form of a scatter plot. the lines represent median value with interquartile ranges. the number of samples for DF is 45, 38 for DHF and 20 for healthy controls. the sample size has a power of 0.52 to detect the observed differences between DF and healthy controls. the sample size has a power of above 0.80 to detect an effect size of 0.8 and above. the number of samples for DF is 48, 45 for DHF and 20 for healthy controls. the difference was not observed in secondary infections with 37% of secondary DF and 40% of secondary DHF patients having low level of MBL. plasma concentrations of vitamin D and MBL were investigated in dengue patients from Pune, Maharashtra, western India. vitamin D is also known to suppress Th1 cytokines and enhance IL-10 production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells in response to microbial antigens. vitamin D is also known to suppress Th1 cytokines and enhance IL-10 production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells. deficiency of MBL may have led to decreased activation of MBL mediated pathway of complement and reduced intravascular clearance of DENV leading to higher viral load. the association of MBL deficiency with DHF in primary infection also suggests that protective effects of MBL and the innate immune responses are more important during primary infection. this is the first study that correlates the concentrations of vitamin D and MBL with immune status of dengue cases. the study also suggests that MBL deficiency is associated with primary DHF. IgG capture ELISA (E-DEN02G, Panbio, Windsor, Australia) was used to classify the cases into primary or secondary DENV infection. estimates of vitamin D and MBL concentrations 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (vitamin D) were quantitated in the plasma samples using an enzyme immunoassay kit (IDS Ltd, UK) the chi-square test with Yates correction or Fisher exact test (when any cell value was less than 5) was performed to examine differences in demographic and clinical characteristics of the dengue patients. age and platelet counts were compared using Mann\u2013Whitney U test. all the samples were collected during the seasonal outbreak in Pune in 2009. the patients were classified into those with DF and those with DHF. patients with fever, headache, myalgia, retro-orbital pain were defined as DF. calibration curve was constructed by plotting the mean absorbance values for each calibrator on the y-axis against the corresponding MBL concentrations in ng/ml on the x-axis. the detection limit of the kit is 5 nm/L. deficiency (defined by a cutoff value of 500 ng/ml) was done and compared between study groups using the chi-square test with Yates correction or Fisher exact test. a two tailed P value less than 0.05 was considered significant. power calculations were performed using the software G*Power version 3.1.3. the authors wish to thank the Indian Council of Medical Research for providing the funds and the Director, National Institute of Virology for the support."}
