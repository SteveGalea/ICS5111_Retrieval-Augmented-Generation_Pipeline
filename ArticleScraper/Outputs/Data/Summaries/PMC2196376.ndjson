LCMV Armstrong 53b is a triple plaque\u2013purified isolate of ARM CA 1371 (23) was used. AN3739 strain of Pichinde virus (24) was used. anti-CD8 (anti-Ly-2 and Ly-3, PharMingen, San Diego, CA), anti-CD4 (anti L3T4; PharMingen), anti-H-2 monotypic antigen (MHC class I), anti-Ia antigen (MHC class II), anti-B220 (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN) and anti-F4/80 (Serotec, Oxford, England). primary LCMV-specific CTL were generated by i.p. inoculation of 5 105 PFU of LCMV. secondary viral CTL assays were done by infecting LCMV-immune mice with viruses. 7 d later the animals were killed and single cell suspensions were prepared from each of the spleens. cDNAs of the LCMV NP and GP genes were cloned behind the MBP promoter to direct expression to CNS oligodendrocytes in transgenic mice. eight founders were identified carrying the LCMV\u2013NP construct, and seven MBP\u2013GP carriers were identified. RNA from the brains (Brn) and spleens (Spl) of MBP\u2013 NP and \u2013GP transgenic mice was subjected to RT-PCR as described in Materials and Methods to detect transgene-specific spliced RNA. the transgenic mouse lines studied are listed with the relative copy number of the transgene and the results of RT-PCR transgene mRNA studies. protein expression in the MBP\u2013NP and \u2013GP mice is likely below the level of sensitivity of antibody detection. previous attempts at identifying LCMV gene products expressed as a transgene had also failed. however, these transgenic mice were shown to express the transgene as shown by CTL recognition of pancreatic cells. MC57 (H-2b) target cells infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus were effectively lysed by lymphocytes from MBP\u2013GP transgenic positive and negative mice. at 2 mo after infection with LCMV, MBP\u2013NP and \u2013GP transgenic positive and negative mice showed good antibody responses. thus, the transgenic positive mice generated LCMV-specific humoral and cellular immune responses equivalent to transgenic negative mice. two MBP\u2013GP lines were infected peripherally with LCMV. viral replication occurs in many tissues and cell types, but not within the CNS. this was confirmed by in situ hybridization studies using LCMV-specific riboprobes. transgenic positive mice cleared virus with the same kinetics as transgenic negative mice. these cells were located in the brain parenchyma as well as the brain stem and spinal cord. by 1 yr after infection, the numbers of CD4+ staining cells had risen to approximately half the number of CD8+ staining cells per section. by 3 mo after infection, clusters of CD4+ and CD8+ cells were found predominantly within the white matter regions of the brain. transgenic mice expressing -gal (MBP\u2013gal) using the same MBP expression vector (18) were infected with LCMV. pattern of immune cell infiltration in MBP\u2013 gal mice was identical to that observed in nontransgenic mice. anti-MHC class I and class II molecules stained cells of different morphologies including cells similar to microglia. anti-MHC class II antibodies stained cells of different morphologies including cells similar to microglia. transgenic positive and negative mice were subjected to a test using a rotating rod apparatus (rotorod) by 3 mo after infection, 75% of the transgenic positive mice appeared ruffled and experienced balance difficulties when walking on the stick. by 3.5 mo after infection, 2 out of 40 transgenic positive mice experienced seizures, and 1 out of 40 exhibited weight loss and ataxia. the ratio of CD8+ to CD4+ cells in the doubly infected transgenic mice was 2:1 (Fig. 3, A and B) the infiltrating cells in the doubly infected transgenic mice were found predominantly within white matter structures of the brain. perivascular cuffs were observed. lesions of infiltrating lymphocytes spanned several consecutive sections. as many as five lesions per sagittal section were found. double immunofluorescent labeling of brain sections with antibody to CD8 and MBP revealed a loss of MBP staining at the center of these lesions. RNA extracts from the brains of transgenic positive and negative mice were subjected to an RNase protection assay using probes to a number of cytokines (20) brains from transgenic mice first infected with LCMV, secondarily infected 6 wk later with either LCMV or VV\u2013NP. mRNAs for various cytokines were detected by RNA isolated from mouse brains as described in Materials and Methods. four transgenic positive (open circles) and negative (closed circles) mice were tested for motor dysfunction on a rotorod apparatus in three consecutive trials. the time on the rotorod was measured, with a maximum of 180 s. the error is shown for all trials except the transgenic negative third trial. infiltrating lymphocytes formed lesions within the white matter regions. these lesions showed a loss of MBP staining accompanied by uptake of MBP by activated microglia/macrophages similar to that observed after a second infection with LCMV. infection of LCMV-immune mice with either virus resulted in the activation of LCMV-specific CTL memory cells capable of lysing MHC-matched. this indicated that infection of LCMV-immune mice with a second virus not encoding LCMV gene products activated LCMV-specific CTL. this indicated that infection of LCMV-immune mice with either virus activated LCMV-specific CTL. the cDNAs of the LCMV NP and GP genes were cloned behind the MBP promoter to direct expression to CNS oligodendrocytes in transgenic mice. eight founders were identified carrying the LCMV\u2013NP construct, and seven MBP\u2013GP carriers were identified. RNA from the brains (Brn) and spleens (Spl) of transgenic mice was subjected to RT-PCR as described in Materials and Methods to detect transgene-specific spliced RNA. spliced mRNA could be distinguished from both unspliced mRNA as well as contamination genomic DNA. protein expression in the MBP\u2013NP and \u2013GP mice is likely below the level of sensitivity of antibody detection. previous attempts at identifying LCMV gene products expressed as a transgene of the rat insulin promoter in the cells of the Islets of Langerhans had also failed. NP from LCMV (VV\u2013NP) were effectively lysed by lymphocytes from MBP\u2013NP transgenic positive and negative mice. MC57 (H-2b) target cells infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the GP from LCMV (VV\u2013GP) were effectively lysed by lymphocytes from MBP\u2013GP transgenic positive and negative mice. transgenic positive and negative mice from the two MBP\u2013NP and two MBP\u2013GP lines were infected peripherally with LCMV. after i.p. infection of immunocompetent mice with LCMV, viral replication occurs in many tissues and cell types. this was confirmed by in situ hybridization studies using LCMV-specific riboprobes after i.p. infection of transgenic mice. at 3 wk after infection about 150\u2013300 CD8+ cells were found per section. these cells were located in the brain parenchyma as well as the brain stem and spinal cord, and perivascular cuffs were often observed. CD4+ cells were present and comprise 20% of the infiltrating T cells. antibody stained with antibodies to CD8 (A and F ), CD4 (B and G ), F4/80 (C and H ), MHC class I (D and I ), and MHC class II (E and J. kinetics of immune cell infiltration in MBP\u2013 gal mice was identical to that observed for the nontransgenic mice. antibodies to MHC class I and class II molecules were used to determine whether an increase in these antigen presentation markers was observed in response to the immune cell infiltration. in uninfected and LCMV-infected nontransgenic mice, MHC class I antigen staining was limited to leptomeninges, choroid plexus, and endothelial cells of blood vessels. transgenic positive and negative mice were subjected to a test using a rotating rod apparatus (rotorod) by 3 mo after infection, 75% of the transgenic positive mice appeared ruffled and experienced balance difficulties when walking on the stick. by 3.5 mo after infection, 2 out of 40 transgenic positive mice experienced seizures, and 1 out of 40 exhibited weight loss and ataxia. the ratio of CD8+ to CD4+ cells in the doubly infected transgenic mice was 2:1 (Fig. 3, A and B) the infiltrating cells in the doubly infected transgenic mice were found predominantly within white matter structures of the brain. a marked increase in expression of both MHC class I and II markers was observed in areas rich in myelin. Focal areas with high numbers of infiltrating T cells were found in the parenchyma of the brain associated with myelin tracts. these lesions ranged in size from 25\u2013150 m, and as many as five lesions per sagittal section were found. double immunofluorescent labeling of brain sections with antibodies to CD8+ and MBP revealed a loss of MBP staining at the center of these lesions. RNA extracts from the brains of transgenic positive and negative mice were subjected to an RNase protection assay using probes to a number of cytokines (20) nontransgenic mice showed minor increases in the levels of TNF-, TNF-, and IL-1 message at 4 wk after second infection. nontransgenic mice showed minor increases in the levels of TNF-, TNF-, and IL-1 message at 4 wk after second infection. four transgenic positive (open circles) and negative (closed circles) mice were tested for motor dysfunction on a rotorod apparatus in three consecutive trials. the time on the rotorod was measured, with a maximum of 180 s. the error is shown for all trials except the transgenic negative third trial. infiltrating lymphocytes formed lesions within the white matter tracts of the CNS. these lesions showed a loss of MBP staining accompanied by uptake of MBP by activated microglia/macrophages similar to that observed after a second infection with LCMV. splenic lymphocytes were isolated and tested in an in vitro 51Cr-release assay for LCMV-specific CTL activity. infection of LCMV-immune mice with either virus resulted in the activation of LCMV-specific CTL memory cells capable of lysing MHC-matched. this indicated that infection of LCMV-immune mice with a second virus not encoding LCMV gene products activated LCMV-specific CTL the data shown are the averages of values from 2\u20134 mice per group. these mice were killed at day 5 after second infection; peak anti-Pichinde CTL activity is at day 7. this is characterized by chronic inflammation of the CNS. molecular mimicry between human transaldolase (TAL-H) and human T cell lymphotropic virus type I/human immunodeficiency virus type 1 gag proteins has also been described. TAL-H stimulated proliferation of peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients with MS. autoantibodies to TAL-H were detected in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid of these patients. oligodendrocytes developed CNS autoimmune disease after a single infection with LCMV. increased levels of cytokines associated with activated CD8+/ CD4+ (Th1) cells were detected (IFN-, TNF-, and TNF-), as well as cytokines associated with activated macrophages/microglia. MS is further characterized by the presence of plaques of demyelination in the CNS. these mice showed focal areas of demyelination consistent with sites of early plaque development. it is possible that additional environmental or genetic factors could influence further plaque development. the total number of infiltrating T cells in the CNS increased three- to fivefold after a second infection with LCMV. other models of autoimmune diseases have shown that the number of self-reactive T cells influences the development of disease. naive transgenic mice with a virus not encoding LCMV gene products did not lead to CNS autoimmune disease. exacerbation of CNS disease after infection with an unrelated virus required the presence of self-reactive (LCMV transgene-specific) memory lymphocytes established by a prior infection with LCMV. cross-activation of memory T cells specific for an oligodendrocyte protein by subsequent viral infections may explain why patients with an autoimmune disease exhibit disease exacerbations after infections by different viruses. a cross-reactive immune response to oligodendrocyte-specific antigens through a process of molecular mimicry early in life could lead to the generation of memory T cells specific for a myelin antigen."}
