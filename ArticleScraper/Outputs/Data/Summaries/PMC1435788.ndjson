{"summary": "emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002 and 2003 affected global health and caused major economic disruption. measurable clinical disease in nonhuman primates infected with SARS-CoV. the world health organization (WHO) was alerted of an outbreak widespread throughout the province. by March 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) had spread to Hong Kong, Singapore, Vietnam, and Toronto, Canada. a special concern was its predilection for nosocomial spread, as 21% of SARS cases occurred in healthcare workers. no studies have evaluated animal model infection or pathogenesis of recombinant infectious clone SARS-CoV (icSARS-CoV) derived from a molecular clone. all studies detected SARS-CoV replication in one or several monkey species and documented seroconversion. radiographic abnormalities are almost universally reported in SARS cases. multifocal disease is present in 30\u201350% of initial radiographs. majority progress to multifocal disease that peaks between 8 and 14 d after symptom onset. al studies focused on clinical and virologic parameters associated with infection in cynomolgus macaques. cynomolgus macaques weighing between 4.6 and 8.8 kg were infected with SARS-CoV in two separate iterations. anesthetized animals received a physical examination, chest radiographs, saphenous vein blood draw, and swabs of oral, nasal, and rectal mucosa. a metabolic pan with a stop-valve drain was used to collect urine. personnel wore Tyvek suits with double gloves and a powered air purifying respirator. animals were inoculated in the nares and bronchus (IN/IB), group II ( n = 2) in the nares and conjunctiva (IN/CJ), and group III ( n = 2) intravenously (IV) all infections were carried out under anesthesia as described above. RNA was extracted from NHP biosamples using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, United States) according to manufacturer's recommendations. purified RNA was added to the appropriate SARS-specific assay master mix (15 l) cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) weighing between 4.6 and 8.8 kg were infected. animals were anesthetized for physical examination, and blood was drawn once preinfection (on day minus 3 or 2). anesthesia was achieved by intramuscular injection of Telazol at 3 mg/kg. anesthetized animals received a physical examination, chest radiographs, saphenous vein blood draw, and swabs of oral, nasal, and rectal mucosa. animals were infected in three groups. two animals (292Q and 91\u2013379) in group II were infected with the icSARS-CoV. the rest of the animals were infected with wild-type virus. radiographs were digitally processed with a Fuji HF 100/300. RNA was extracted from NHP biosamples using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, United States) according to manufacturer's recommendations. purified RNA was analyzed on the RAPID, Idaho Technology, Salt Lake City, Utah, United States. all animals in groups I and II displayed mild to moderate symptoms of illness beginning between postinfection days (PID 2\u20134) observed symptoms included decreased activity, decreased feeding, snuffling, and mildly labored breathing. telemetry monitoring in four animals revealed no significant changes in temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, or left ventricular pressure. radiographs show perihilar airspace disease in the right lower lobe. lower lobe disease is clearly seen on the lateral view. 91\u2013379 showed a slight increase in the right lower lobe opacity. both 292Q and 91\u2013379 had increasing disease on PID 8. mild residual and resolving changes were still evident in 292Q. infected animals showed a statistically significant trend of rising total leukocyte count. group I had an isolated elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 229 units per liter on day 2. the ALT was within normal range on every other day for this animal. serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine did not suggest a significant change in renal function in any animal during the course of SARS-CoV infection. viral RNA was found in at least five contiguous rectal swabs or fecal specimens. a total of 30 biosamples with a Q-PCR crossing threshold under 32 from five animals were cultured. a total of 30 biosamples with a crossing threshold under 32 from five animals were cultured. all animals in groups I and II displayed mild to moderate symptoms of illness beginning between postinfection days (PID 2\u20134). observed symptoms included decreased activity, decreased feeding, snuffling, and mildly labored breathing. no overt clinical illness in the group III animals, which were infected intravenously. radiographs of animal 292Q show airspace disease involving the right lower lobe, left lingula, and perihilar right upper lobe. two of the three animals with radiographic evidence of disease were infected by the IB/IN route (group I) and one was infected by the CJ/IN route (group II) infected animals showed a statistically significant trend of rising total leukocyte count during the course of infection. mean WBC count rose from 5.5 10 9 per liter on day 0 to a peak of 10.6 10 9 per liter on PID 12. no animal had a WBC count above the USAMRIID upper limit of normal of 15.0 10 9 per liter. serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine did not suggest a significant change in renal function in any animal during the course of SARS-CoV infection. Neutralizing Antibodies All animals had convalescent anti-SARS-CoV antibodies detected by plaque reduction neutralization test. group II animals had viral genome detected in at least five contiguous rectal swabs or fecal specimens. a total of 30 biosamples with a Q-PCR crossing threshold under 32 from five animals were cultured. cynomolgus macaques infected with SARS-CoV develop clinical disease with pulmonary radiographic findings. the virus displayed tropism for the upper respiratory mucosa. replication at distal sites reflects systemic viral infection. nasopharyngeal shedding of SARS-CoV increased for the first 10 d of symptoms. disease produced by wild-type SARS-CoV Urbani and by icSARS-CoV was clinically indistinguishable. only one of the animals infected with wild-type virus developed radiographic disease. difference in findings is more likely related to route of infection and dose. all six animals displayed no clinical signs of disease and had normal chest radiographs (unpublished data) these animals included the two animals initially challenged with the recombinant icSARS-CoV, demonstrating that molecularly cloned virus induced protective immune responses. rowe et al. [ 25] examined SARS-CoV infection in cynomolgus and rhesus macaques and reported only minimal symptomatic disease. symptomatic infection was detected only in animals challenged mucosally and not in animals infected IV [ 25]. t al. [ 22] and McAuliffe et al. [ 20] also used the Urbani strain of SARS CoV given by a similar route (intranasal and intratracheal), but our clinical observations were significantly different. they used 10 6 to 10 6.3 cell culture infective doses (also known as TCID 50) mild or indolent disease in adults does not closely reproduce SARS in adult humans. the similarity between our findings and SARS in children should be further examined. wild-type SARS-CoV and recombinant icSARS-CoV produced similar disease in our macaque model. the disease we observed had some similarities to SARS in young children. further study is needed to determine the applicability of NHP models to the study of SARS. kaline phosphatase (alk phos) (A\u2013C); alanine aminotransferase (D\u2013F); albumin (G\u2013I); blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (J\u2013L), and creatinine (M\u2013O). results are grouped by route of infection: group I, intrabronchial + intranasal (A, D, G, J, M); group II, conjunctival + intranasal ( a new virus known as SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) caused only mild respiratory infections. experts differed in their opinion on how the disease should be treated. no vaccine has yet been developed for it. the infected animals did not get severe disease, but rather the disease was more like that seen in infected children. this animal model of disease may well be useful in developing therapies and vaccines against this illness. chemistry results from cynomolgus macaques infected with SARS-CoV on day 1. included are results for alkaline phosphatase (alk phos) (A\u2013C); alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (D\u2013F); albumin (G\u2013I); blood urea nitrogen (J\u2013L) and creatinine (M\u2013O). emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003 served as reminder of how a new infectious disease had the potential to cause huge economic disruption. experts differ in their opinion on how the disease should be treated, and no vaccine has yet been developed for it. Previously identified human coronaviruses caused only mild respiratory infections. the infected animals did not get severe disease, but rather the disease was more like that seen in infected children. this animal model of disease may well be useful in developing therapies and vaccines against this illness. researchers had already given the virus to a number of animal species, ranging from mice to pigs to monkeys. none showed symptoms that were similar to those seen in humans. some of the animals were given the virus isolated from humans. tm The WHO has a web site with up-to-date information on SARS."}
