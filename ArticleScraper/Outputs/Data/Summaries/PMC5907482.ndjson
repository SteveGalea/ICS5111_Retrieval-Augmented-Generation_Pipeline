{"summary": "the filmArray\u00ae Respiratory Panel (FARP) is a multiplex PCR assay that can rapidly (60 min) detect 17 common respiratory viruses and 3 bacterial targets in a single reaction. if the NP FARP is negative, performing the test on a BAL sample may have an incremental yield. multiplex panels are rapid and accurate, but the high cost may limit their use in resource-limited settings. if testing is completed, it is usually done on an easily accessible specimen type (e.g., throat swab or nasopharyngeal [9] (NP) swab) 125 patients (100 ICH and 25 non-ICH) who underwent a bronchoscopy with BAL were enrolled in this study. ages ranged between 26 and 85 years (mean 70 years), and 58% were male. an immunocompromised status was defined as patients who were recipients of systemic steroids (for 21 days), disease-modifying agents (e.g., inhibitors of tumor necrosis factor), chemotherapy, or calcineurin inhibitors. the protocol for collection and testing of specimens was approved by the institutional review board at our center. patients provided informed consent and were sedated prior to bronchoscopy. a wire-shafted, BBL CultureSwab was used to sample posterior nasopharynx per routine protocol. the NP swab was collected solely for study purposes. no other microbiology studies were conducted on this source. 0.3 mL of raw BAL fluid was loaded into a filmArray v1.6 pouch. patients undergoing bronchoscopy with BAL to rule out infection were not considered immunocompromised. a bronchoscopy with BAL was performed, in which 20 ml aliquots of normal were aliquoted. saline were instilled into a subsegmental bronchus corresponding to an area of radiographic abnormality on CT. a 1-2 mL aliquot of the BAL specimen and the NP swab were recovered by immediate return suction. no other microbiology studies were conducted on the BAL sample. samples had concordant results, 73% (91/125) were negative for all targets in both NP and BAL specimens. the remaining 11% (14/125) had discordant results in NP and BAL specimens by the FARP.
