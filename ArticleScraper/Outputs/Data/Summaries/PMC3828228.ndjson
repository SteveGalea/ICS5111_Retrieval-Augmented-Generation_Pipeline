{"summary": "a 60-year-old man was hospitalized with acute respiratory symptoms and was tested to be negative for diseases known at that time. he also suffered from renal failure and died later. this new virus was originally named HCoV-EMC for human coronavirus. the newly discovered virus could lead to an outbreak that would resemble the SARS-CoV (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome \u2013 Coronavirus) epidemic of 2002-4.1 HCoV-EMC has been found to be quite different from SARS-CoV. infection with MERS-CoV, unlike SARS, often comes with multiple organ failures,2 including rapid kidney failure. protein intrinsic disorder is characterized by a wide functional spectrum. it is characterized by a wide functional spectrum, being commonly involved in various signaling, regulation, and recognition processes. the protein intrinsic disorder-based model for the classification of coronaviruses was developed before the discovery of MERS-CoV. the model basically measures the percentage of intrinsic disorder (PID) in the two major coronavirus shell proteins, the M and N proteins. the model proposed in our previous paper4 was able to classify coronaviruses on the basis of disorder level (PID, percentage of intrinsic disorder) in the shell proteins. the breakdown resulted in an automatic categorization of the viruses by transmission behaviors. most disordered group A included coronaviruses that had the highest respiratory transmission and the least oral-fecal transmission. most disordered group A included coronaviruses that had the highest respiratory transmission and the least oral-fecal transmission. a hard outer shell in group A could mean higher fecal-respiratory or urine-respiratory potential. a hard outer shell in group A could mean higher fecal-respiratory or urine-respiratory potential. the bat coronavirus species used in this study are more closely related to MERS-CoV than viruses used in the previous publication. a comparison of the PID of the bat CoV species used here and the bat CoV samples in the previous paper shows little differences especially for the N-protein. MHV is the only structure of the nucleocapsid protein of the coronaviruses in disorder group C that is currently available in the PDB. the structure of its N-protein is not too dissimilar to that of the bat coronaviruses suggesting that MHV is likely to be near the boundary between groups B and C. this meta-predictor is moderately more accurate than each of the component predictors and provides accurate disorder predictions at the residue level. proteins from IBV, SARS-CoV, MHV, Bat-HKU4, and MERS-CoV are predicted to be mostly ordered, possessing disordered termini. pronounced disorder spikes around residues 38 and 135 and rather similar sets of peaks in vicinity of residues 75 and 140. disorder propensities of the coronaviral N-proteins suggest that MERS-CoV may originate from bat coronavisures. scores above 0.5 correspond to disordered residues/regions (shaded in light pink). for MHV, the only available structure is the structure of the RNA-binding and dimerization domain (PDB code: 3HD4, residues 60-197) for MHV, the only available structure is the structure of the RNA-binding domain (PDB code: 3HD4, residues 60-197). the structural alignment was done by MultiProt (http://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/MultiProt/). the aligned structures were drawn using the VMD software. scientists attempt to answer the question of infectivity of MERS-CoV is by looking at the locations and distribution of the receptors in lungs. a way that scientists attempt to answer the question of infectivity of MERS-CoV is by looking at the locations and distribution of the receptors. the higher oral-fecal potential of MERS-CoV explains much of the perplexing data relating to MERS-CoV. the higher oral-fecal potential of MERS-CoV explains much of the underlying reasons for its virulence and its high adaptability to a broad range of animal hosts. TGEV (PID: 43% for N and 14% for M) resembles MERS-CoV (PID: 43% for N and 9% for M) this suggests that higher oral-fecal transmission means higher chances of infection via close contacts and touch. this factor has implications for evolution of virus in acquisition of adaptability to cells of a wide variety of animals. fecal-respiratory transmission is negligible or non-existent in MERS-CoV. it has a harder outer shell (PID of 9% in M-protein) than that of TEGV. this means that HCoV-EMC is more likely to remain intact in a non-physiological environment for a longer period of time. TGEV does not need to survive in the external environment for long since it spreads rapidly among pigs4. this softness seen in the M-protein of TGEV could not be detected in the MERS-CoV, which has a PID of 9%. avian IBV has a hard outer shell with its M-protein having a PID of 9.8%. the similarity in the PID scores for IBV and MERS-CoV M-proteins could reflect the need of both viral particles to remain in the environment for at least a reasonable period of time. the transmission of MERS-CoV by saliva is quite possible. the first has to do with the fact that it is categorized into disorder group C. another involves the prediction that its outer shell is hard. the protein intrinsic disorder model could provide initial evolutionary snapshots of a new virus that could be followed by searches for other viruses that may be evolutionarily similar. many viruses that spread via oral-fecal or oral-urine mode are highly virulent especially to humans. TGEV80 and Nipah virus76 are examples of viruses that spread rapidly among porcine herds. it is not hard to find other viruses that have adapted to a broad range of animal hosts. a closer look at the levels of disorder shows that bat coronaviruses have somewhat more ordered N-proteins (47.51) when compared to, say, SARS-CoV (50%) the species analyzed here are HKU4 and HKU5, which are closely related to MERS-CoV. this suggests that bat-CoV are likely to be located at the borderline between disorder groups B and C. a plausible hypothesis suggests that being at the borderline confers to the virus a larger flexibility in its future evolution and helps it to accommodate other animal hosts. ulence found in many viral diseases that rely largely on oral-fecal transmission for spread. model provides a glimpse of an entity\u2019s past, he says. he says many viruses, such as Nipah virus, hantaviruses, and Ebola virus, have adequate respiratory components to be troublesome. a model that provides us with a glimpse into the evolutionary past of a virus is likely to better serve as an epidemiological tool that could allow researchers to look into areas that would have been otherwise missed. this may arise from the inability to obtain adequate information about a new virus."}
