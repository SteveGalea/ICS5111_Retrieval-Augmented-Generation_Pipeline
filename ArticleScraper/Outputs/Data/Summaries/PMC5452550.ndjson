{"summary": "PTSD is defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition as a constellation of emotional and behavioral responses to traumatic events. the affected person frequently reports an exposure to death, threatened death, actual or threatened serious injury, or actual or threatened sexual violence. in this Editorial, we will discuss the very real and well-documented phenomenon of PTSD among EVD survivors, caretakers, and their immediate contacts. agic fever of the worst kind was the terrifying reality of being a volunteer physician during the 2014\u20132016 Ebola outbreak in west africa. agic fever was associated with substantial risks and stressors (both physical and psychological) to health-care workers. the emotional burden of exposure to an event as massive and overwhelming as a deadly disease outbreak may not be immediately apparent among the staff. EBOV arouses deep fear in outbreak-affected areas. it is well known that EBOV arouses deep fear in outbreak-affected areas. many myths and misinformation contributed to deep distrust among local populations. posttraumatic stress is considered to be a well-established risk among health-care workers facing deadly outbreak or disaster events. it has been suggested that the deployment of preventive initiatives should be considered early in the course of preparation and implementation of medical assistance programs. mental health issues in general tend to be relatively neglected in low and middle income countries. there have been reports of fear and mistrust of authorities in areas devastated by the outbreak. the same mistrust that may have led to behaviors that contributed to the spread of the illness also made challenging the mental health outreach and treatment intended to assist the affected populations. a cross-sectional survey showed that depression and PTSD increased EVD-related risk behaviors, such as waiting to see if symptoms subsided, attempting to treat symptoms at home with traditional remedies. a new aspect of PTSD that is unique to Ebola is introduced and only reaffirms the need to aggressively prevent and treat posttraumatic stress. reintegration into the community is negatively affected by fear, stigma and misconceptions, as well as the breakdown of social networks. nearly 39% of surviving respondents faced difficulty concentrating on tasks, 33% experienced problems with sleep due to worry, with 5%\u201310% reporting feelings of worthlessness. EBOV infection tends to impact communities in a number of unique ways. grief, anxiety, and depression represent emotional responses to loss. e.g., PTSD and survivor's guilt are factors in the development of significant anxiety. the EBOV may stay dormant within one's body and there is a low \u2013 yet terrifying \u2013 possibility that a reactivation could result in a relapse of the acute illness. a number of neurologic and systemic conditions are now being identified and cataloged among survivors, suggesting that those fortunate enough to survive the acute EVD may have to deal with health consequences. \"trauma signature analysis\" is a method used during major natural disasters. it is important for local and regional agencies to have an effective strategy in place. survivors of EVD should have a mental health specialist involved in their care due to the inherent risk of long-term psychological sequelae. despite the loss of life, psychological trauma, and economic devastation, ebola-stricken regions of West Africa continue to resiliently rebuild from the 2014\u20132016 outbreak. despite the loss of life, psychological trauma, and economic devastation, the region continues to resiliently rebuild from the 2014\u20132016 outbreak. the lingering toll of the outbreak now takes the form of PTSD as well as the physical post-Ebola syndrome. for the first time, the fear of a new outbreak can be moderated by the comfort of having a powerful new tool to stop the spread of this deadly virus."}
