{"summary": "IFN-stimulated genes interfere with and modulate various stages of the viral replication cycles. humans express at least four IFITMs: IFITM1, -2, and -3 are ubiquitously expressed, whereas IFITM5 is limited to osteoblasts. IFITMs inhibit membrane fusion of all three classes of viral fusion proteins. controversies need to be resolved (16, 17) IFITM2 and -3, but not IFITM1, restrict Rift Valley fever virus entry (12) and even enhance a human coronavirus, HCoV-OC43 (29). this analysis fortuitously revealed two basic residues whose removal from IFITM1 increased its restriction of JSRV and amphotropic murine leukemia virus (MLV) the 1A, 1B, 2, 3A, 3B, and 4 plasmids were provided by Juan Bonifacino (National Institute of Health) and Heike F\u00f6lsch (Northwestern University, Chicago, IL). HA-tagged ubiquitin constructs were gifts of David Pintel (University of Missouri) the expression of FLAG-tagged IFITM1 and mutants was detected using an anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Sigma) western blotting was probed with an anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Sigma). syncytium formation assay was performed as described previously. the fusion activity was quantified by measuring the fusion activity in culture medium 24\u201348 h after coculture (32) the fusion activity was quantified by measuring the activities in culture medium 24\u201348 h after coculture (32) the fusion activity was measured by measuring the activities in culture medium 24\u201348 h after coculture (32). deconvolution was carried out using LAS AF three-dimensional blind deconvolution microscope. images were analyzed, with overlaps between IFITM1 proteins or viral particles and endosomal markers determined by using Fiji ImageJ plugins. triton X-100 (1% final concentration) was added to each tube to completely lyse the cells. samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. results from 3\u20135 independent experiments were used for analysis. stably expressing Hyal2), and 293/GP-LAPSN (expressing MLV Gag-Pol and alkaline phosphatase) cells were co-transfected with 2 g of plasm. all mammalian cells were cultured in modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) effector 293T cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding Tet-off and 10A1 Env with R peptide deleted. target cells were 293FT cells expressing Tet-response element-regulated Gaussia luciferase. the fusion activity was quantified by measuring the activity in culture medium 24\u201348 h after coculture (32). cells were stained for alkaline phosphatase-positive foci and scored at 72 h postinfection using light microscopy. HTX cells expressing IFITMs of interest were transfected with plasmids encoding different cellular markers. thirty-six hours after transfection, cells were washed with PBS and fixed in 4% freshly made paraformaldehyde. 293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding IFITM1 WT or mutants with the indicated residues substituted by a cysteine. cells were detached by 5 mm EDTA, washed once with cold PBS, and then washed with cold HCN buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm CaCl2). the resulting products were cloned into the pQCXIP retroviral vector. all mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. the 1A, 1B, 2, 3A, 3B, and 4 plasmids were kind gifts from Walther Mothes. proteins samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. expression of FLAG-tagged IFITM1 and mutants was detected using an anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Sigma) effector 293T cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding Tet-off and 10A1 Env. target cells were 293FT cells expressing Tet-response element-regulated Gaussia luciferase (gift of Marc Johnson, University of Missouri) the fusion activity was quantified by measuring the Gaussia luciferase activities in culture medium 24\u201348 h after coculture (32). X-100 cells were incubated with TRITC-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma) for 1 h. cells were stained with DAPI (Sigma) to detect nuclei. deconvolution was carried out using LAS AF three-dimensional blind deconvolution. Triton X-100 was added to each tube with a final concentration of 2 mm. all three samples were incubated for an additional 30 min at 4 \u00b0C. HA-tagged ubiquitin constructs were gifts of David Pintel (University of Missouri) all mammalian cells were cultured in modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) all mammalian cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) syncytium formation and cell-cell fusion assay performed as described previously. effector 293T cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding Tet-off and 10A1 Env with R peptide deleted. target cells were 293FT cells expressing Gaussia luciferase. HTX cells expressing IFITMs of interest were transfected with plasmids encoding different cellular markers. cells were permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 for 5 min at room temperature, blocked with 5% BSA for 30 min, and incubated with an anti-FLAG antibody for 1 h. 293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding IFITM1 WT or mutants with the indicated residues substituted by a cysteine. aliquot was left in HCN buffer alone (non-permeabilized), the second was resuspended in 0.04% digitonin, and the third was resuspended in 0.25% Triton X-100. chimeras containing the C-terminal region of IFITM1 showed strong inhibition of JSRV similar to that of wild type (WT) IFITM1. chimeras containing the IFITM2 C terminus (IFITM1112 and -1222) were unable to restrict or enhanced JSRV infection. the C terminus of IFITM1 modulates restriction of JSRV but not IAV entry. the two putative membrane-spanning domains (MSD1 and MSD2) of IFITMs are indicated by bars over the alignment. key point mutations used in this study are indicated. the phenotypes of a series of C-terminal deletion mutants of IFITM1 confirmed a dominant role for the tail sequences, particularly residues 117\u2013125, in the differential restriction of JSRV and IAV entry. the C-terminal dibasic residues of IFITM1 are critical for ubiquitination, and mutation of these residues results in reduced ubiquitination yet enhanced restriction of JSRV and IAV entry. 293T cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding the indicated IFITM1 and HA-tagged ubiquitin (Ub-HA) cells were lysed, IFITM1 proteins were immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG beads, and the ubiquitination pattern was detected by Western blotting using monoclonal anti-HA antibody. of 112\u2013125 or 117\u2013125 substantially decreased the IFITM1 ubiquitination. ubiquitination of IFITM1 was significantly lost in K122A, R123A, and KR/AA mutants. all three Lys-to-Ala mutants exhibited enhanced inhibition of JSRV infection but had no significant effect on IAV. HTX cells stably expressing the WT or mutant IFITM1 were transfected with plasmids encoding YFP-Rab5, RFP-CD63, or GFP-LAMP1. compared with WT IFITM1, the KR/AA and 4KR + KR/AA mutants showed no significant difference in association with the early endosomal marker Rab5. co-localization of the KR mutants with LAMP1 was decreased HTX cells expressing IFITM1 or mutant IFITM1 co-localized with RFP-CD63. at 1 h postinfection, 5\u201310% of JSRV pseudoviruses co-localized with RFP-CD63 (50%, p 0.001) at 4 h postinfection. IFITM1 Binds to AP-3, the Activity of Which Is Diminished when the C-terminal Dibasic Residues Are Altered The cytoplasmic tails of many transmembrane proteins interact with the adaptor protein complexes. we therefore assessed the possible interactions of IFITM1 with the subunits of the adaptor protein complexes known to be essential for the sorting process. 293T cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged WT or mutant IFITM1 as well as myc-tagged subunits of adaptor protein complexes AP-1, AP-2, AP-3, and AP-4. interacting complexes were identified by immunoprecipitation (IP) of cell lysates using anti-Myc antibody. AP-3 knockdown mirrors our finding that the IFITM KR/AA mutant also exhibited an increased surface expression as compared with IFITM1 WT. immunoostaining and three-dimensional deconvolution imaging analysis showed that IFITM1 exhibited an increased co-localization with CD63. but a decreased co-localization with LAMP-1 in AP-3 knockdown cells, a phenotype that was similar to KR/AA. HTX or 293 cells stably expressing IFITM1 were transduced or untransduced by lentiviral vectors expressing shRNA against AP-3 or scrambled shRNA. results represent one of the two independent experiments. we transfected 293T cells with these mutants and incubated cells with a membrane-impermeable reagent, mPEG (5 kDa), that labels unmodified cysteine residues with a polyethylene glycol chain of 5 kDa average mass. the agent was applied to cells under three labeling conditions in parallel, each using exactly the same cell number. IFITM1 adopts a mixed topology in cellular membranes determined by SCAM. mPEG labeling of free-cysteine residues increases molecular mass by an average of 5 kDa. schematic diagrams of possible IFITM1 topologies deduced from Fig. 7B. each topology was assigned an arbitrary Roman numeral for ease of referral. labeling of all cysteine mutants was greatest in samples from Triton-permeabilized cells. intracellular R123C populations can present their C terminus on the luminal side. we also tracked the membrane orientation of the C terminus using S108C. a large increase in labeling under these conditions further supported the possibility that the C terminus is predominantly luminal. chimeras containing the C-terminal region of IFITM1 showed strong inhibition of JSRV similar to that of wild type (WT) IFITM1. chimeras containing the IFITM2 C terminus (IFITM1112 and -1222) were unable to restrict or enhanced JSRV infection. infection was normalized to the level observed in HTX cells expressing empty vector (Mock) values are the mean and S.E. (error bars) of 3\u20135 independent experiments. IFITM1 contains a relatively long tail, whereas IFITM2 terminates four residues after MSD2. IFITM1 Y125F and Y125A had no apparent effect on restriction of JSRV or IAV infection. mutation of these residues results in reduced ubiquitination. values shown were normalized to the level of infection observed in mock expressing empty vector. effects of IFITM1 KR mutants on cell-cell fusion and entry mediated by 10A1 MLV Env. values shown were normalized to that of parental cells (Mock) we found that KR/AA and 4KR + KR/AA substantially inhibited its Env-mediated entry and cell-cell fusion. these results indicate that the C-terminal KR residues are essential for IFITM1 ubiquitination, loss of which correlate with increased restriction of JSRV and 10A1 MLV entry. T or mutant IFITM1 were transfected with plasmids encoding GFP-Rab5, RFP-CD63, or GFP-LAMP1. immunofluorescence staining was performed with anti-FLAG antibody to visualize IFITM1 proteins. representative images were captured as described under \"Experimental Procedures\" HTX cells stably expressing WT or mutant IFITM1 were transfected with a plasmid encoding RFP-CD63. cells were spinoculated with JSRV-MLV Gag-GFP pseudovirions at 4 \u00b0C for 2 h to allow virus binding to the cell. we found that K122A, R123A, KR/AA, and 4KR + KR/AA, but not K122R and 4KR, exhibited either a greatly decreased or complete loss of association with 3A and 3B. these data revealed that IFITM1 protein specifically binds to AP-3 and, to a lesser extent, AP-2. knockdown of AP-3 itself substantially inhibited JSRV and 10A1 entry but had a modest effect on IAV. expression of IFITM1 WT, but not the KR/AA mutant, in the AP-3 knockdown cells further enhanced inhibition of JSRV and 10A1 entry. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that knockdown of AP-3 consistently, although not dramatically, increased the IFITM1 expression on the plasma membrane compared with that of shRNA-scramble HTX or 293 cells stably expressing IFITM1 were transduced or untransduced by lentiviral vectors expressing shRNA against AP-3 or scrambled shRNA. untransduced, cells expressing IFITM1 were not incubated with any antibody. we interrogated the membrane topology of IFITM1 using SCAM (39) cysteine residues were substituted for polar or charged residues located at the N terminus (S22C), central loop (R66C), second putative membrane-spanning domain (T97C) and C terminus (S108C and R123C) mass of WT IFITM1 in non-permeabilized cells indicates native Cys-50, Cys-51, and Cys-84 residues are not available for labeling. mPEG labeling of free-cysteine residues increases molecular mass by an average of 5 kDa. putative central loop (Arg-66), second putative membrane spanning domain (Thr-97) and C terminus (Ser-108 and Arg-123) were replaced with a cysteine residue for SCAM analysis. the experiments were repeated more than five times, with similar patterns obtained. a small portion of molecules in the plasma membrane oriented their central loop toward the extracellular space. however, this region was extensively exposed to the cytosol because labeling was substantially increased in digitonin-treated cells expressing R123C. a large increase in labeling under these conditions further supported the possibility that the C terminus is predominantly luminal. chimeras containing the C-terminal region of IFITM1 showed strong inhibition of JSRV similar to that of wild type (WT) IFITM1. chimeras containing the IFITM2 C terminus (IFITM1112 and -1222) were unable to restrict or enhanced JSRV infection. the two putative membrane-spanning domains (MSD1 and MSD2) of IFITMs are indicated by bars over the alignment. key point mutations used in this study are indicated. the N termini, two MSDs, central loop, and C-terminal sequences of IFITMs are delineated by lines within the boxes. we were particularly interested in tyrosine 125 (Tyr-125) and lysine (Lys-122) because these two residues are potentially phosphorylated and/or ubiquitinated. however, despite repeated attempts, we were unable to detect tyrosine phosphorylation of IFITM1 as we had previously shown for IFITM3 (22). cells were lysed, IFITM1 proteins were immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG beads. the same PVDF membrane was stripped, and the ubiquitination pattern was detected by reblotting anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (bottom panels). the same PVDF membrane was stripped, and IFITM1 proteins were detected by reblotting anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (bottom panels). all four conserved lysines were replaced by arginine (4KR), but combination of 4KR with KR/AA (4KR + KR/AA) resulted in almost complete loss of IFITM1 ubiquitination. the positively charged KR residues are critical for IFITM1 ubiquitination, although the Lys-122 itself is not a key site of ubiquitination. HTX cells expressing the WT or mutant IFITM1 were transfected with plasmids encoding GFP-Rab5, RFP-CD63, or GFP-LAMP1. co-localization of the mutants with CD63 was decreased relative to WT IFITM1 (20%; p 0.001) 5\u201310% of JSRV pseudoviruses co-localized with CD63 (Fig. 4, A and B) at 4 h postinfection, a significant proportion of JSRV pseudoviruses co-localized with CD63 (50%, p 0.001). the overlap between Gag-YFP and RFP-CD63 was constantly lower for KR/AA compared with IFITM1 WT at 4 h after infection. the cytoplasmic tails of many transmembrane proteins interact with the adaptor protein complexes. we also found that IFITM1 strongly associated with the 3A and 3B subunits of AP-3. a weak association between IFITM1 and the 2 subunit of AP-2 was also observed. input cell lysates were analyzed by direct blotting with an anti-Myc antibody. tubulin served as loading control. Knockdown of AP-3 Modulates the Endocytic Trafficking and Antiviral Effect of IFITM1. -1 in AP-3 knockdown cells, a phenotype similar to KR/AA. the association of AP-3 with IFITM1 targets the protein to late endosomes and lysosomes, impairing its inhibition of JSRV and 10A1 that enter cells in an early endosome-related compartment. HTX or 293 cells stably expressing IFITM1 were transduced or untransduced by lentiviral vectors expressing shRNA against AP-3 or scrambled shRNA. results represent one of the two independent experiments. unstained, cells expressing IFITM1 were not incubated with any antibody. kDa detected by Western blotting would indicate that the cysteine residue of interest is labeled by mPEG and thus exposed to the environment. the agent was applied to cells under three labeling conditions in parallel, each using exactly the same cell number. the native Cys-50, Cys-51, and Cys-84 residues are not available for labeling. the labeling of WT IFITM1 did not change when mPEG was given access to the cytosolic IFITM1 adopts a mixed topology in cellular membranes determined by SCAM. a, 293T cells were exposed to HCN buffer alone (non-permeabilized condition; left panel), digitonin (plasma membranes permeabilized; middle panel), or Triton X-100 (plasma membranes permeabilized; middle panel) Western blotting analysis was performed to detect the mPEG-labeled IFITM1 proteins using anti-FLAG antibody labeling of all cysteine mutants was greatest in samples from Triton-permeabilized cells. bulk of IFITM1 S22C molecules presented their N terminus to the luminal and extracellular sides of membranes. small portion of molecules in the plasma membrane oriented their central loop toward the extracellular space. a large increase in labeling under these conditions further supported the possibility that the C terminus is predominantly luminal. the C-terminal Tail of IFITM1 Regulates Differential Restriction of Viral Entry We previously showed that IFITM1 restricts JSRV entry more effectively than IFITM2 and -3 in HTX cells. Western blotting showed that the expression levels of these constructs were similar to that of parental IFITM1 and -2. the C terminus of IFITM1 modulates restriction of JSRV but not IAV entry. analysis of expression of chimeric (F) or C-terminal truncation mutants using anti-FLAG antibody. -actin serves as loading control. phenotypes of a series of C-terminal deletion mutants of IFITM1 confirmed a dominant role for the tail sequences. 293T cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding the indicated IFITM1 and HA-tagged ubiquitin (Ub-HA) cells were lysed, IFITM1 proteins were immunoprecipitated and the ubiquitination pattern was detected by Western blotting using monoclonal anti-HA antibody (top panels) we examined whether the C-terminal Lys-122 residue of IFITM1 is ubiquitinated. however, deletion of 112\u2013125 or 117\u2013125 substantially decreased the IFITM1 ubiquitination. ubiquitination of IFITM1 was significantly lost in K122A, R123A, and KR/AA mutants. HTX cells stably expressing the WT or mutant IFITM1 were transfected with plasmids encoding YFP-Rab5, RFP-CD63, or GFP-LAMP1. compared with WT IFITM1, the KR mutants showed no significant difference in association with the early endosomal marker Rab5. nuclei of cells were stained by DAPI. overlap quantification of WT or mutant IFITM1 proteins with indicated markers. HTX cells expressing WT or mutant IFITM1 were transfected with. cells were spinoculated with JSRV-MLV Gag-GFP pseudovirions at 4 \u00b0C for 2 h to allow virus binding to the cell. cells were then washed twice with PBS to remove unbound viruses and switched to 37 \u00b0C. 293T cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding AP-1, AP-2, AP-3, and AP-4. interacting complexes were identified by immunoprecipitation (IP) of cell lysates using anti-Myc antibody, followed by Western blotting using an anti-FLAG antibody to detect IFITM1. knockdown of AP-3 knockdown cells further enhanced inhibition of JSRV and 10A1 entry. this increase in IFITM1 expression by AP-3 knockdown mirrors our finding that the IFITM KR/AA mutant also exhibited an increased surface expression as compared with IFITM1 WT. HTX or 293 cells stably expressing IFITM1 were transduced or untransduced by lentiviral vectors expressing shRNA against AP-3 or scrambled shRNA. results represent the average S.D. (error bars) of 3\u20135 independent experiments. we interrogated the membrane topology of IFITM1 using SCAM (39) cysteine residues were substituted for polar or charged residues located at the N terminus (S22C), central loop (R66C), second putative membrane-spanning domain (T97C), and C terminus (S108C and R123C) we transfected 293T cells with these mutants and incubated cells with a membrane-impermeable reagent, mPEG (5 PEG was given access to the cytosolic compartment (digitonin-permeabilized; Fig. 7A, middle panels); however, some labeling at a single cysteine occurred in Triton-permeabilized cells. these results imply that a small portion of WT IFITM1 contains only two palmitoylated cysteine residues. the band intensities were quantified by using Quantity One (Bio-Rad) and compared by setting the signal level of R66C and R123C under the non-permeabilization condition as \u201c+\u201d. the estimates shown are \u201cnet\u201d signals (i.e. for \u201ccytosolic,\u201d the signals of extracellular signals were deducted; for \u201cluminal\u201d the signals of both extracellular and cytosolic signals were subtracted) plasma membrane IFITM1 R123C was weakly labeled in non-permeabilized cells expressing R123C. no significant increase in labeling occurred in digitonin-permeabilized cells expressing R123C. the intracellular R123C populations can present their C terminus on the luminal side. the C-terminal KRXX motif targets the IFITM1 protein to endolysosomal compartments, where different viruses fuse and enter host cells. however, the effect of the KRXX motif on viral entry may be human IFITM1-specific. other sorting signals may also be critical for the differential restriction of IFITM1 on viral infection. knockdown of AP-3 increases inhibition of IFITM1 WT on JSRV and 10A1 entry. knockdown of AP-3 did not significantly affect IAV infection, suggesting that either the knockdown efficiency of AP-3 is not sufficient to influence IAV infection or, alternatively, IAV could use non-canonical pathways for infection. this raises the possibility that evolution of a nearly canonical dibasic motif may provide a percentage of IFITM1 direct access to COP I-mediated sorting pathways in the endosomal compartments. in the absence of the dominant dibasic motif KRGY, a secondary sorting motif may become more active in determining sorting of the KR/AA mutant. future experiments will determine the exact role of the C-terminal KRXX motif of IFITM1 in endo Flow cytometry of non-permeabilized cells confirmed that in the plasma membrane the N and C terminus of IFITM1 can be presented to the extracellular space (5, 11) however, no apparent difference was observed between WT IFITM1 and its key KR/A mutants examined in this study. we depict the possible membrane topologies for human IFITM1 protein. the topologies of IFITM1 are controlled and related to membrane curvature and antiviral activities."}
