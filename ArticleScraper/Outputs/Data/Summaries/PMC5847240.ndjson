{"summary": "vaccine-derived herd immunity may be short-lived due to interactions between human mobility and imperfect or waning vaccine efficacy. we show that migration and waning vaccine efficacy strongly influence the duration of herd immunity while birth and death rates have relatively minimal impacts. kOCVs can be a quick stopgap measure to protect cholera-prone populations such as refugee camps. but it remains unclear how much time is \u201cbought\u201d by vaccination before longer-term solutions such as water, sanitation, and hygiene promotion are necessary. modeling studies of other diseases suggest a suite of factors which may have contributed to the camp\u2019s susceptibility to an outbreak. this includes waning vaccine efficacy, the influx of susceptible displaced people, an extremely high birth rate, and resettlement of vaccinated individuals. the relative contributions of these factors and their implications for vaccination strategy in the future are not clear. susceptible individuals (S) can become vaccinated (V1) and proceed through each monthly vaccine compartments (V1,V2,...,Vn) the force of infection for individuals in a compartment Vi is reduced by a factor of 1 VE(i) according to a leaky model of vaccine action. a complete kOCV course includes two doses administered approximately two weeks apart. the timescale of interest for this study is measured in years, not days. for generalizability across disease systems, we focus on the number of vaccine courses rather than the number of actual vaccines. only 9% of a study population in Calcutta, India, changed in the two years following vaccination in 2006. to represent a highly mobile urban population, we estimate a migration rate of 1 2 y e a r s from the observation that 58% of a study population in Dhaka, Bangladesh, had relocated over two years. the threshold of 10 cases is a reasonable cutoff size. a large outbreak is henceforth very likely for sizeable values of Re. we can calculate the probability of an outbreak of more than y cases initiated by a single infectious case. Imig is calculated by: I m i g = N ( e m - 1 ), (5) where is the probability an incoming migrant is infected, m is the size of the targeted population, and therefore the daily number of incoming migrants equals N(emt 1) where t = 1 day. a larger difference suggests a more impactful vaccination intervention. a camp resettlement rate of 1 4.3 y e a r s is balanced by an equal rate of entries for a net-zero impact on N(t) and a dynamic population size, N(t), driven by net growth or shrinkage through camp entries or exits. births & deaths 70.3% 100,000 0 1 4.3 y e a r s 0 38.1% 3.7% 5.4% Only Resettlement 70.3% 100,000 0 1 4.3 y e a r s 52.9% 18.5% 27.1% \u2018Observed\u2019 Empirical Empirical 1 24.4 y e a r s 0 38.9% 18.5% 18.5% 27.1% \u2018Observed\u2019 Empirical Empirical the population compartments of principal interest for this study are individuals who are fully susceptible to disease, S, and those who were vaccinated n-months ago, Vn. the population compartments of this study are individuals who are fully susceptible to disease, S, and those who were vaccinated n-months ago, Vn. we model mass vaccination as a large fraction of individuals moving into the V1 compartment on a particular day, possibly recurrently (e.g., annually) in each approach, vaccine priority is given first to susceptible individuals, then those who were vaccinated the longest time ago. human mobility We assume individuals emigrate from the population at a rate that is the same regardless of vaccination status. the total population size, N(t) is held constant by offsetting emigration with an equal rate of immigration, unless otherwise noted. outcome measurements We define the duration of herd immunity (DHI) as the amount of time following a vaccination campaign with an effective reproductive number, Re, below one. when a simulation asymptotically approaches Re (t) = 1 from below, we define DHI as the time until Re (t) 0.99. we simulate a setting with migration rates ranging from zero, representing a closed population, to a very high value of 1 1 y e a r (i.e., an average residence time of one year) we assume each imported case has an independent probability of starting an outbreak of more than y cases given the effective reproductive number Re(t) on that day. we estimated population susceptibility over time, X(t), in six scenarios. we used empirical measures of four key drivers of waning herd immunity. the birth/death rate was set to zero; vaccine efficacy was held constant at its maximum value (70.3%) for all time since vaccination. the population size was held constant at approximately the level observed during the outbreak (100,000) to isolate the impact of each driver of waning herd immunity. a scenario i that isolates one driver, we measure the proportion susceptible (X(t)i) on October 16, 2016. we calculate the difference between estimates of the proportion susceptible at the start of the outbreak under scenario i with estimates in the composite counterfactual scenario, X ( t ) i = X ( t ) i - X ( t ) c o m p o m p o m p o s i t e. population susceptibility increases over time in presence of migration rates of 1 2 y e a r s (solid line), 1 20 y e a r s (dashed line), and zero (dotted line) the probability that a single case sparks an outbreak of more than 10 cases is set to zero in each simulation. mass vaccination reduces, but does not eliminate, the probability that an imported case sparks an outbreak for a duration of time that depends critically on the migration rate and how vaccine efficacy wanes over time. a blended strategy that complements a single mass vaccination campaign with subsequent routine vaccination can maintain herd immunity longer than either strategy alone. routine vaccination of 2.4% (green), 3.6% (teal) or 4.8% (purple) of the population per month achieve herd immunity for 0, 4.4, and 4.3 years. a \u201cMass and Maintain\u201d strategy with one-time vaccination at 75% coverage followed by routine vaccination of 2.4% (green), 3.6% (teal), or 4.8% (purple) of the population per month can render herd immunity for 1.6, 5.2, and 4.3 years. the optimal migration rate is slower in settings with a larger population size, a higher transmission potential (R0), or where a higher fraction of incoming migrants are infected (e.g., due to high-burden neighbors) a higher fraction of incoming migrants are infected (e.g., due to high-burden neighbors) the proportion susceptible over time decreases due to mass vaccination events. the probability that a single case sparks an outbreak of more than 10 cases increases with X(t) and R0. only 52% of the population would have been susceptible on the date the first case was reported in the camp. the drivers of waning herd immunity in this population, from strongest to weakest, were short-lived vaccine efficacy, population growth, camp resettlement rate, and demographic turnover via births and deaths. population susceptibility increases over time in presence of migration rates of 1 2 y e a r s (solid line), 1 20 y e a r s (dashed line), and zero. birth and death rates are set to zero in each simulation. kOCV vaccination with 100% coverage in a population with high migration. mass vaccination every year or every two years with 100% coverage of susceptible individuals can render herd immunity for 3.5 or 2.8 years, respectively, before depleting a fixed vaccine allotment of 3N full vaccine courses. however, recurring mass campaigns have diminishing returns per vaccine once herd immunity is achieved. a blended strategy that complements a single mass vaccination campaign with subsequent routine vaccination can maintain herd immunity longer than either strategy alone. size = 10,000; maximum vaccine courses = 30,000; R0 = 1.5; migration rate = 1 2 y e a r s; birth and death rates = 1 40 y e a r s. communities with intermediate levels of migration may experience the largest vaccine-derived decrease in outbreak risk sparked by an imported case. the average probability that a migrant is infected is 1/N, where N is the population size. only 37% of the camp remained susceptible after the second round of vaccination in June 2015. by December 1, 2016, only 40.5% of camp residents had ever been vaccinated. the probability that a single case sparks an outbreak of more than 10 cases increases with X(t) and R0, as represented by line color: R0 = 1 (blue); 1.5 (green); 1.8 (black); and 2 (red). Using case reports and assuming a fixed generation interval distribution, we estimate the mean effective reproductive number, Re (t), exceeded unity for approximately two months following the first case, with a maximum likelihood estimate of 1.45 (1.18\u20131.75). 34% of the population were susceptible on the day of the first reported cases in Bentiu PoC, which would render herd immunity even if R0 was as high as 3. the duration of vaccine-derived herd immunity depends critically on vaccine coverage, waning vaccine efficacy and a net influx of susceptible people through population mobility. a growing area of research focuses on the vaccine efficacy, and duration of protection, provided by a single kOCV dose. this work will help elucidate the relative merits of revaccination versus ongoing vaccination of new arrivals. current guidelines for the optimal use of the kOCV stockpile recommend targeting areas with important population movements. our model assumes a leaky mode of vaccine action, whereby vaccination reduces the disease susceptibility of each recipient. our calculation of proportion susceptible, X(t), is robust to other assumptions regarding the method by which vaccine effects wane, namely: time-dependent failure in \u201ctake,\u201d corresponding to an all-or-nothing response. kOCV with the B-subunit is less preferred for vaccine stockpile applications. but our primary results present the kOCV efficacy profile with the B-subunit due to the biological plausibility of the estimates in the time-varying analysis. herd immunity is a key target for the control of vaccine-preventable diseases. information is essential for optimizing revaccination strategies, targeting vaccine stockpiles and explaining re-emergence of outbreaks in recently vaccinated populations. the final epidemic size distribution in a population of 1000 is monotonically decreasing when R0 equals 0.9 (red) and follows a bimodal distribution when R0 equals 1.2 (yellow), 1.5 (green), 1.8 (blue) and 2.5 (black) the inset shows a cutoff of 10 cases can discriminate large and small outbreaks with high sensitivity. d immunity (DHI) is maximized in settings with high vaccine coverage and low basic reproductive numbers. migration rates are set to zero. uncolored regions never obtain herd immunity. population susceptibility on October 16, 2016 is 0.52 (dashed line), as compared to 0.81 in the absence of the mass and Maintain strategy. the proportion susceptible over time, X(t), calculated by Eq 5 is identical for both modes of action (solid lines)"}
