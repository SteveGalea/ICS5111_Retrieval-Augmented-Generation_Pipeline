{"summary": "first-in-human phase 1 clinical trials were conducted in HIV-1-infected and normal healthy volunteers with DNA vaccines encoding HIV-1 and malaria antigens. the results of early clinical trials of DNA vaccine candidates indicated favorable safety and tolerability profiles and evidence of humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. proof-of-concept testing of the vaccine in a phase 2 trial has been completed. the vaccine is expected to enter a pivotal phase 3 trial sponsored by Astellas Pharma, Incorporated. a recombinant gB vaccine produced in CHO cells was developed and tested in combination with an MF59 adjuvant in multiple clinical studies over the ensuing decades. despite these results it is unclear whether gB adjuvanted by MF59 will continue further development for either indication. the potential importance of creating vaccines that target the pentameric gH/gL/UL128/UL130/UL131 epithelial entry pathway may have contributed to redirected vaccine efforts by some companies. the first-in-human phase 1 clinical trials were conducted in HIV-1-infected and normal healthy volunteers with DNA vaccines encoding HIV-1 and malaria antigens. proof-of-concept testing of the vaccine in a phase 2 trial has been completed. the vaccine is expected to enter a pivotal phase 3 trial sponsored by Astellas Pharma, Incorporated. antiviral drugs have reduced the incidence of CMV end organ disease (EOD) in CMV+ recipients from 25% prior to their licensure to approximately 5% today. alternative measures for controlling CMV replication after transplantation without attendant drug toxicities are needed. a vaccine has yet to be licensed for any indication. despite these results it is unclear whether gB adjuvanted by MF59 will continue further development for either indication. other vaccine approaches such as viral vectored gB [15] and/or pp65 [16,17] have completed phase 1 testing with evidence of safety and immunogenicity. it is conceivable that the recent recognition of the potential importance of creating vaccines that target the pentameric gH/gL/UL128/UL130/UL131 epithelial clinical development timeline of ASP0113 (TransVax) from product concept in 2002 to initiation of a phase 3 trial in 2013. development activities that continued and/or were refined during clinical development are shown in rectangular boxes within the large dotted arrow. plasmid DNA vaccines offer safety advantages compared to live attenuated virus or viral vectors. the ability to stimulate the desired antiviral T-cell responses like live virus vaccines but unlike protein vaccines. plasmid DNA vaccines allow a focusing of immune responses on select antigens. antiviral activity of pp65-specific T-cells can control CMV replication in transplant recipients. a secreted form of gB was created that could retain conformationally-intact epitopes. four amino acids, 435RKRK438, were deleted from the otherwise full-length, 561 amino acid, pp65. formulation A synthetic, nonionic triblock poloxamer, CRL1005, was selected as the lead formulation candidate for this product. this poloxamer consists of a polyoxypropylene core flanked by a polyoxyethylene (POE) block. injection of rhesus macaques with an HIV-1 gag-encoding plasmid with CRL1005 provided the highest T-cell responses compared to other formulations. the final bivalent vaccine formulation was designed to be a 1-mL intramuscular (IM) injection consisting of a 5-mg total plasmid dose (2.5 mg of each plasmid), 7.5 mg of CRL1005 and 0.1 mg/mL of BAK. the formulation provided key practical advantages compared to an alternative cationic lipid-based formulation undergoing development during that time. a higher DNA dose could be formulated (up to 5 mg/mL) and the vaccine has been referred to by different names throughout its development history including VCL-CB01, TransVaxTM, and ASP0113. it has been referred to by different names throughout its development history including VCL-CB01,

like live virus vaccines but unlike protein vaccines. plasmid DNA vaccines allow focusing of immune responses on select antigens. natural infection identified as vaccine candidates including a tegument phosphoprotein, pp65, a dominant T-cell antigen and an envelope glycoprotein, gB, a major target for neutralizing antibodies [20,21,22]. a comprehensive study was published in 2005 in which the prevalence of both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell recognition of essentially all (213) CMV proteins was characterized in 33 normal, healthy subjects. each codon-optimized gene was synthesized and cloned into the Vical plasmid backbone VR10051. the final plasmid nomenclatures were VCL-6365 and VCL-6368 for gB- and pp65-expressing plasmids. synthetic, nonionic triblock poloxamer, CRL1005, was selected as the lead formulation candidate for this product. the final bivalent vaccine formulation was designed to be a 1-mL intramuscular (IM) injection consisting of a 5-mg total plasmid dose (2.5 mg of each plasmid), 7.5 mg of CRL1005, and 0.1 mg/mL of BAK. the final bivalent vaccine formulation was designed to be a 1-mL intramuscular injection consisting of a 5-mg total plasmid dose. a plasmid encoding a model antigen, influenza A nucleoprotein (NP) elicited antibodies and CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses to defined epitopes. NP antibody responses were 1.6-fold higher (p 0.001) and CD4+ responses to defined class II-restricted peptides were 1.7-fold higher (p 0.01) IM injections at 2-week intervals of 0 mg, 0.5 mg, and 5 mg doses of product were evaluated. no product-related changes were found with exception of increased but reversible creatinine phosphokinase levels after the last injection. two-dose and three-dose regimens of the bivalent plasmids and each monovalent plasmid were tested with and without CRL1005/BAK formulation. this formulation significantly increased the immune responses compared to the bivalent vaccine in PBS only, thereby abrogating the immunological interference encountered when the combination was prepared in PBS only. safety-toxicology study was conducted in rabbits that received 4 IM injections at 2-week intervals of 0 mg, 0.5 mg, and 5 mg doses of product. no product-related changes in these evaluations were found with exception of increased but reversible creatinine phosphokinase levels after the last injection. Vical produced all bulk drug substance (DS) lots of each of the plasmids. each plasmid was produced by bacterial fermentation using DH10B. each plasmid was produced by bacterial fermentation using kanamycin selection. the final drug product (DP) was made by mixing each monovalent bulk DS at a 1:1 mass ratio to create a bivalent bulk DS that was then formulated with CRL1005 and BAK under aseptic conditions. the bulk DP was aseptically filled into glass vials and stored frozen. DS and DP achieved at least 36 months of stability. messenger RNA expression from plasmid DNA is the most immediate biological activity measurable after DNA vaccine delivery. the %RP assay was incorporated as a DP release test for phase 2 clinical trial material (CTM) lots. a correlation was established between in vitro potency and in vivo gB antibody responses in mice. final purified bulk DS for each plasmid was adjusted to the final DNA concentration and frozen. in-process QC testing was conducted throughout all of the above steps. samples of DP were placed on a 36-month stability program. the majority of the DS and the DP release assays are standard, i.e., applicable regardless of plasmid. however, one plasmid-specific DP release assay, a relative potency assay, merits discussion. ASP0113 was a multicenter open label phase 1 trial in 44 normal, healthy subjects. subjects received IM injections of 1-mg or 5-mg DNA doses on a 0-, 2-, 8-week schedule or 5-mg DNA dose on an accelerated 0-, 3-, 7-, and 28-day schedule. the vaccine was well tolerated, with no serious adverse events (SAEs) and no discontinuations due to vaccine-related adverse events. the ex vivo ELISPOT assay was performed with week 32 specimens from CMV subjects on the 0-, 2-, 8-week injection schedule. Neither of the 2 subjects in the 1-mg dose group who were responders in the assay at earlier time points had detectable responses at Week 32. trial design and safety in HCT recipients aged 18\u201365 years with various forms of lymphoma and leukemia. all subjects who received at least one dose were included in the safety analysis and a total of 74 subjects were included in the per protocol population analysis. PP population for the vaccine group (19/40, 47.5%) compared to the placebo group (21/34, 61.8%) but the difference did not achieve statistical significance (p = 0.145) compared to the placebo group, the vaccine group had significantly lower occurrence of detectable CMV viremia (p = 0.008). T-cell responses to pp65 or gB were numerically higher in the ASP0113 group relative to the placebo group at all time points evaluated after transplant. despite the variability in the magnitude of the responses, there was a trend towards a significant difference in the responses at Day 56, and statistical significance was reached by Day 84. the pp65 T-cell responses in the ASP0113 group were still higher than those of the placebo group with a treatment effect of p = 0.005. the comparatively higher responses in the ASP0113 group were independent of CMV viremia [40] and likely due to vaccination with ASP0113. astellas Pharma Global Development, Inc. has been recently registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov. subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive ASP0113 or PBS placebo. primary efficacy endpoint of this trial is overall mortality at one year post-transplantation. the most frequent AEs were injection site pain, myalgia, headache, and malaise. systemic reactions included mild to moderate malaise and myalgia. local reactions included injection site pain, induration, swelling, and erythema. p = 0.0256; Fisher\u2019s exact test, for responses in the 1-mg and 5-mg dose groups at Week 32. T-cell responses at Week 32 in CMV subjects on the 0-, 2-, 8-week injection schedule and at Week 16 for those on the 0-, 3-, 7-, 28-day schedule were also evaluated. the vaccine was well tolerated, with no serious adverse events (SAEs) and no discontinuations due to vaccine-related adverse events. the most frequent AEs were injection site pain, myalgia, headache, and malaise. ELISPOT assay demonstrates the ability of vaccine-primed memory T-cells to proliferate and produce IFN- on exposure to vaccine encoded antigen. memory T-cell responses were detected in 15 of 22 CMV subjects (68%). the protocol was amended to enroll a recipient-only (unpaired) arm. subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive 5-mg doses of ASP0113 or PBS placebo prior to ablative conditioning. all subjects who received at least one dose were included in the safety analysis and a total of 74 subjects were included in the per protocol population analysis. the vaccine group had significantly lower occurrence of detectable CMV viremia (p = 0.008), fewer CMV viremic episodes (p = 0.017), longer time to initial viremia (p = 0.003) and shorter duration of viremia when normalized to days on study (p = 0.042). a post-hoc analysis of a composite of these endpoints revealed a difference in favor of vaccine which did not achieve statistical significance (p = 0.10) the pp65 responses had a U-shaped distribution in both groups. three categories, defined as 750, 750\u20132,999, and 3,000 SFU/106 PBMC, were used for analysis of the pp65 responses. the treatment effect p-value of 0.022 for day 56 through day 365 suggests that recipients of ASP0113 were significantly more likely to have high levels of pp65 T cells compared with the placebo group. the pp65 T-cell responses at Day 56 were significantly higher in the ASP0113 group than in the placebo group. gB antibody levels were not significantly higher in the ASP0113 group than in the placebo group until after the fourth injection. the late divergence of the gB antibody levels in the two groups compared with the early divergence of the T-cell responses. all subjects who received at least one dose were included in the safety analysis. a total of 74 subjects were included in the per protocol population analysis. the two groups were well-balanced for demographics, conditioning regimens, and donor relatedness and serostatus. a post-hoc analysis of a composite of these endpoints revealed a difference in favor of vaccine which did not achieve statistical significance. these endpoints included CMV EOD (manifest as pneumonia or gastroenteritis), overall mortality, grade 3\u20134 acute GVHD, and severe chronic GVHD. three categories, defined as 750, 750\u20132,999, and 3,000 SFU/106 PBMC, were used for analysis of the pp65 responses. treatment effect p-value suggests recipients of ASP0113 were significantly more likely to have high levels of pp65 T cells compared with the placebo group. pp65 responses in the ASP0113 group were still higher than those of the placebo group with a treatment effect of p = 0.005. the pp65 T-cell responses at Day 56 were significantly higher in the ASP0113 group than in the placebo group. the gB antibody levels were not significantly higher in the ASP0113 group than in the placebo group until after the fourth injection. the late divergence of the gB antibody levels in the two groups compared with the early divergence of the T-cell responses. this trial is anticipated to enroll 500 subjects and is analytically divided into two parts. part 1 will be used to evaluate the adequacy of the primary endpoint and, if necessary, to modify the primary endpoint to be specified for Part 2. this trial will enroll subjects at approximately 90 HCT centers in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial is planned with ASP0113 in CMV recipients receiving a kidney transplant from either a living donor or a deceased donor who is CMV+. a CMV prophylactic vaccine that can prevent congenital CMV infection would have a tremendous public health impact. a prophylactic congenital CMV vaccine (CyMVectinTM) was developed by developing a different product formulation, a cationic lipid adjuvant called Vaxfectin\u00ae, combined with gB and pp65-expressing plasmids. additional research is ongoing to identify one or more additional plasmids expressing other CMV genes for potential inclusion in this vaccine."}
