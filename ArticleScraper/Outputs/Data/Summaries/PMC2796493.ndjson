{"summary": "the multidisciplinary working group, airPath, was organised to review and discuss the problem of pathogens. four two-day meetings over a period of 18 months from July 2007 have generated contributions from more than 30 participants, over 20 oral presentations, and various round-table discussions. research methods, review and discussion At the first two meetings, participants were given a topic and asked to prepare a one-page literature review. each topic was assigned to two participants from different disciplines in order to ensure cross-disciplinarity of the discussion. participants discussed four main areas that are known to contribute pathogens to the outdoor air and have proved to be linked with human health. we need various techniques to support our research, such as sampling, detection and identification, monitoring, transport models, and laboratory experimentation. climatological factors can influence viral disease transmission, e.g. respiratory syncytial virus [6]. the environmental sampling of human viruses is therefore an area that we regard as important. micro-arrary and immuno-assays can tell us what kind of microbes are detected and identified. other new techniques have been proposed for bio-detection. for example, characterising the size and shape of bioaerosols, pollens and fungal spores under microscope. a variety of examples were given on the study of viruses in the air. it is important to better understand the risk factors associated with outdoor air transmission of infections, but the best approach is not always straightforward. environmental factors can significantly impact on the fate and behaviour of bioaerosols and health risk. the presence of new and emerging diseases is one of the most urgent threats to humanity across the globe. climate change is a high priority issue that everyone is facing. the longer it takes to identify the source, the higher the risk it poses to people. there is a significant knowledge gap in understanding and assessing the risk of outdoor pathogens in air. pathogens from environmental sources are diverse in terms of type of source and aerosolisation factors. it is moreover possible that some pathogens are under-reported because a number cause similar respiratory symptoms, e.g. coughing and sneezing [2,3] climatological factors can influence viral disease transmission, e.g. respiratory syncytial virus. some studies show that climatological factors can influence viral disease transmission, e.g. respiratory syncytial virus. monitoring is widely recognised that background biological and chemical materials will influence monitoring. air movement, sunlight/UV radiation, humidity, rainfall, and inversions are some of the environmental factors that need to be considered during monitoring. a variety of examples were given on the study of viruses in the air. it is important to better understand the risk factors associated with the outdoor air transmission of infections. the best approach is not always straightforward, as it is difficult to conduct controlled laboratory experiments. climate change is a high priority issue that everyone is facing. new and emerging diseases are a major health concern because we do not know much about them. genetics and the state of the immune system of the global population plays a key role in disease prevalence. there is a significant knowledge gap in understanding and assessing the risk of outdoor pathogens in air. a risk assessment framework was used to assess the potential health risks from bioaerosols from composting. a risk assessment framework was used to assess potential health risks from bioaerosols from composting. this paper is one of the outcomes of the working group. all the participants contributed to this work and their names and research interests can be found in the working group website."}
