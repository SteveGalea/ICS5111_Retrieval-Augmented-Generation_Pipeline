{"summary": "a high-throughput high-density microarray platform is needed for rapid large-scale screening of vertebrate pathogens. EOPM was designed to detect almost all known pathogens and related species based on their genomic sequences. despite a lower sensitivity than PCR, EOPM is sufficiently sensitive to detect the predominant pathogens causing clinical symptoms. in 2007, an outbreak of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) infected 1149 people. the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic affected more than 154,000 human patients, leading to 842 deaths in china alone. a system implemented by the medical community and government for the monitoring of pathogens that could negatively impact public health is urgently required in China. the first generation of microarray platform, called ViroChip, detects a wide range of viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa. the platform uses long oligonucleotide probes and random amplification of nucleic acids. the EOPM was designed based on the latest versions of nucleic acid sequence resources for microbes. the EOPM Chip distinguishes all 2,554 known vertebrate virus species. 151 genera, 36 families, 38 fungal genera, 47 genera of parasites. 58 virulence genes were selected, including rfbE. candidate probes were screened according to the following criteria. probes with a length of 60 nt, no repeats exceeding a length of 8 nt, no hairpins with stem lengths exceeding 10 nt, GC content between 30\u201370%, and Tm from 60\u201380\u00b0C. hybridizations involved a fluorescently-labeled synthetic oligonucleotide. a fluorescently-labeled synthetic oligonucleotide was complementary to a positive control probe. this ensured that signals appeared in every zone of each sub-array. arrays for hybridization overnight at 65\u00b0C in a hybridization oven (Agilent) arrays were then washed with 2 SSC, 0.005% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 1 min, followed by a second wash with 0.2 SSC at 37\u00b0C for 1 min. images were extracted and analyzed using a dual-laser scanner (Agilent) the majority of the probes targeting an expected pathogen are likely to be positive, and not hybridize with other non-target microbes. the p-value is adjusted using Benjamini and Hochberg's FDR correction. microbial microarrays and unbiased high throughput sequencing typically rely on random amplification. we spiked viral RNA into human RNA, mimicking the actual clinical samples. RNA was then randomly amplified and hybridized with the EOPM microarray. the EOPM Chip distinguishes all 2,554 known vertebrate virus species (involving 151 genera, 36 families), 124 bacterial genera (involving 53 families), 38 fungal genera (involving 17 families) and 47 genera of parasites (involving 24 families). probes were targeted to conserved regions in areas encoding structural proteins. regions tagged as 5\u2032 UTR, 3\u2032 UTR, and LTR were also extracted. candidate probes were screened according to BLAST analysis to select conserved viral probes at the genus level. a total of eight sub-arrays with 60,000 distinct 60-mer probes in one slide were customized. a fluorescently-labeled synthetic oligonucleotide was complementary to a positive control probe. this ensured that signals appeared in every zone of each sub-array. the EOPM arrays were then washed with 2 SSC, 0.005% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 1 min, followed by a second wash with 0.2 SSC at 37\u00b0C for 1 min. the images were extracted and analyzed using a dual-laser scanner (Agilent) the majority of the probes targeting an expected pathogen are likely to be positive, and not hybridize with other non-target microbes. the probes were ranked by the signal of the Cy5 fluorescent dye that was used to label the patient sample. EPOM Molecular detection methods traditionally rely on random amplification. we spiked viral RNA into human RNA, mimicking the actual clinical samples. RNA was then randomly amplified and hybridized with the EOPM microarray. the EOPM technique described here also uses long oligonucleotide probes and random PCR amplification. dengue virus was used as a test subject to determine whether the EOPM method could detect the virus from an infected C6/36 cell culture. 196 dengue virus Flavivirus Vs1.7636 352 65529 186 Phnom Penh bat virus Flavivirus Vm.41 370 65529 177 Dengue virus Flavivirus Vm.9292 453 65529 145 Tembusu virus Flavivirus bacts.5220 286 37895 133 Staphylococcus Staphylococcus Vs1.7675 543 65529 121 Deer tick virus Flavivirus Vm m: the number of probes designed for a target genus; m: the number of positive probes for a genus; m: the number of probes designed for a target genus; n: the number of positive probes for a genus. by following similar procedure, we successfully tested EOPM on a panel of other known pathogens, including an RNA virus, a DNA virus, bacteria, fungi, and parasites. stranded RNA virus Rotavirus A Rotavirus Double stranded RNA Mammalian orthoreovirus Orthoreovirus Double stranded RNA Human adenovirus Mastadenovirus Double stranded DNA virus Group B streptococcus Streptococus Gram positive bacteria Listeria monocytogenes. 103 copies of spike virus RNA could be detected in 1012 copies of host RNA by specific RT-PCR. adenoviruses were significantly enriched, as were the top five species results. RNA/DNA from patients was labeled with red cy5 fluorescent dye. nucleic acid from normal serum was labeled with green cy3 dye. HFMD is a common viral illness that predominantly affects infants and children younger than 5 years old. the pathogens responsible for HFMD are mainly coxsackie A16 virus (CVA16) and enterovirus 71 (EV71) the genera Cardiovirus and Enterovirus belong to the family Picornaviridae, a family of positive single-stranded RNA viruses. a few intestinal viruses of the Picornaviridae family are also known to potentially cause HFMD syndrome. us m M N-M N Adjusted p-value Cardiovirus 15 110 54947 550 6.42E-12 Muromegalovirus 3 190 54867 550 0.9594 Coemansia 2 96 54961 550 0.9637 Arthrobacter 2 108 54949 550 0.9771 Nairovirus 2 146 54911 550 0.9923. the software can support a large-scale search of probe hits against a comprehensive microbial sequence top 15 probes identified in EOPM analysis of cell culture infected with dengue virus. eight targeted dengue virus specifically, while a further four targeted related flavivirueses such as Phnom Penh bat virus.

RNA/DNA from patients was labeled with red cy5 fluorescent dye, and nucleic acid from normal control serum was labeled with green cy3 dye. HFMD epidemics usually occur in late spring and early summer. the pathogens responsible for HFMD are mainly coxsackie A16 virus (CVA16) and enterovirus 71 (EV71), both of which belong to the Enterovirus genus. the routine HFMD clinical diagnosis includes three qRT-PCR kits targeting the Enterovirus genus. strains coxsackie A virus and enterovirus 71, are also known to potentially cause HFMD syndrome. to confirm the presence of Cardiovirus in patent feces, two specific nested RT-PCR primers were used to amplify the RNA extracted from the Enterovirus-negative HFMD children. the software can support a large-scale search of probe hits against a comprehensive microbial sequence database. the software can be accessed at http://www.genestone.com.cn:8080/microbial/index.jsp. 60,000 60-mer oligonucleotide probes target 2,554 vertebrate virus species. oligonucleotide probes can cross-hybridize with similar but non-identical sequences. EOPM can distinguish bacteria, fungi, and parasites at either the genus or family level. wabs, are used for pathogen screening. EOPM can detect both RNA viruses and DNA viruses in the same standard protocol. for bacteria, fungi, and parasites, EOPM detects 16S rRNA copies encoded by rRNA genes located in the genomic DNA. low-density microarrays usually use short oligonucleotides of about 20-nucleotides as specific probes. the very limited number of short probes/primers targeting a pathogen could fail to detect sequences with mutations located in the regions targeted by the probes/primers. however, over a dozen long oligonucleotide probes were designed for each pathogen in the EOPM method, allowing reliable identification of a path EOPM is a powerful pan-microbial detection microarray platform. it can detect almost all known pathogens and related species. EOPM is sensitive enough to detect pathogens causing clinical symptoms. pre-publication history The pre-publication history for this paper can be accessed here: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/13/437/prepub Supplementary Material Additional file 1 Two pairs of specific primers for amplifying adenovirus, and the sequence of PCR products from clinical case 1.
