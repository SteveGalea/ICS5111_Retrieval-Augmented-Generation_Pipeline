{"summary": "pathological changes in lung alveoli most likely follow a common pathway. type-2 pneumocyte hyperplasia occurs to replace loss of infected type-1 pneumocytes. fibrosis may lead to loss of alveolar function in more protracted cases. mice infected with varying doses of SARS-CoV in the respiratory tract show no clinical signs of disease. the infection is accompanied by only mild inflammatory changes of the respiratory tract. the infection is accompanied by only mild inflammatory changes of the respiratory tract. studies from different laboratories confirmed that nonhuman primates could be infected experimentally with SARS-CoV. virus strain, age, microbiological state, genetic background, and origin of the animals could have played a role. a group of animals inoculated via the nasal and ocular route exhibited significant faecal shedding of SARS-CoV. efforts to evaluate the efficacy of SARS-CoV vaccines have largely aimed at protecting the respiratory tract."}
