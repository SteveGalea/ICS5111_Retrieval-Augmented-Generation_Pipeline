{"summary": "the incidences of WNV infection from Culex to humans have increased greatly due to global travel. some vaccines and treatments have been developed, including imino sugar derivatives [3], DNA vaccines [4], interferon treatment, and human monoclonal antibodies. the clinical evaluation of hE16 and other mAb therapeutics for flavivirus infections should monitor for the selection or emergence of resistant variants. serum IgG and F(ab\u2032)2 fragments neutralized WNV infection in tissue culture. equine immunoglobulin and equine neutralizing F(ab\u2032)2 passive immunotherapy could be potentially useful for the treatment of patients infected with WNV. the supernatant was ultra-centrifuged at 38,000 rpm for 1.5 h at 4 \u00b0C. after 1.5 h of ultra-centrifugation at 30,000 rpm, the WNV-VLP-containing bands between the 10%\u201330% sucrose were collected. plates were pre-coated with 100 L of purified EDIII antigen diluted in 0.02 mol/L carbonate sodium buffer (pH 9.6) after blocking with skim milk for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C, 100 L of serially diluted serum samples were added to the wells. the plate was washed three times with PBS containing 0.5% Tween-20 (PBST), and then 100 L of an HRP (horseradish peroxidase)- the solution was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 20 min. the precipitates were dissolved in saline and dialyzed overnight at 4 \u00b0C to remove the salt. the pH of the horse anti-WNV serum was adjusted to 3.3 with 1 mol/L HCl. the spleens and brains were harvested at the indicated time points. the spleens and brains were harvested at the indicated time points and titered using Vero cells. the supernatant was ultra-centrifuged at 38,000 rpm for 1.5 h at 4 \u00b0C. the pellets were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline. after 1.5 h of ultra-centrifugation at 30,000 rpm, the bands between the 10%\u201330% sucrose were collected. 96-well microtiter plates were pre-coated with 100 L of purified EDIII antigen diluted in 0.02 mol/L carbonate sodium buffer (pH 9.6) at a final concentration of 10 g/mL. 100 L of two-fold serially diluted serum samples were added to the wells, which were then incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1.5 h. the plate was washed three times with PBS containing 0.5% Tween-20 ( the solution was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 30 min. the precipitates were dissolved in saline before 1/3 volume of ammonium sulfate was added. pH of horse anti-WNV serum was adjusted to 3.3 with 1 mol/L HCl. pepsin was activated by a NaAc solution (pH 3.3) then added to the horse antiserum. the titers of virus stocks were determined by a standard plaque assay using vero cells, as previously described [21]. the spleens and brains were harvested at the indicated time points and titered using Vero cells. serial serum samples were collected. the EDIII-specific IgG titers were all above 1:20,480 after five immunizations. the sera were collected 2 weeks after each immunization. Equine Antibodies Neutralized WNV in Cell Culture. we found that the immune sera neutralized WNV infection in vitro. equine IgG and F(ab\u2032)2 also neutralized WNV infection. agarose plugs were visualized by 0.1% crystal violet staining; (B) the dilutions; and (D) Concentrations for 50% of the maximum neutralizing effect are shown. we transferred purified horse immune IgG or purified horse immune F(ab\u2032)2 intraperitoneally into mice one day before or after infection. 30%\u201340% of mice receiving the control horse IgG died. all mavs/ mice from the control group died. 90% of mice that received the horse immune IgG survived. antibody treatment decreased the virus load in both the WT and Mavs/ mice. n = 6, hIgG; n = 5, hF(ab\u2032)2; (E) n = 5, Control; n = 10, hIgG; (E) n = 8, hF(ab\u2032)2. eight to twelve-week-old mice were infected with 100 PFU WNV in the footpad. 500 g of the purified horse immune IgG (hIgG) or the purified horse immune F(ab the EDIII-specific IgG titers were all above 1:20,480 after five immunizations. horses were intramuscularly immunized with WNV-VLP (virus-like particles) and boosted every two weeks for an additional four cycles. Equine Antibodies Neutralized WNV in Cell Culture using a plaque reduction-neutralizing assay. we found that the immune sera effectively neutralized WNV infection in vitro. equine IgG and F(ab\u2032)2 also neutralized WNV infection. purified horse immune IgG or purified horse immune F(ab\u2032)2 survived. 50% of the mice that received the horse IgG one day before the infection survived. mice from the control group died, whereas 90% of mice that received the horse immune IgG survived; the F(ab\u2032)2 treatment protected only 30% of the mice. antibody treatment decreased the virus load in both the WT and Mavs/ mice. p = 0.009 when Control group compared to hIgG group. p = 0.0291 when Control group compared to hIgG group. eight to twelve-week-old WT (A,B) and Mavs/ mice were infected with 100 PFU WNV. titers in serum were up to 1:40,960 after five immunizations. equine anti-WNV immunoglobulin and neutralizing F(ab\u2032)2 decreased the virus load and protected mice from a lethal WNV infection. mavs/ mice are immunocompromised with the deficiency of MAVS gene which is important for viral RNA sensing. the quality of the neutralization antibody can influence the treatment efficacy, which may depend on the quantity and quality of the F(ab\u2032)2 fragments. the results of this study show that F(ab\u2032)2 fragments are not as efficient as IgG, both in vitro and in vivo. both treatments with equine anti-WNV immunoglobulin or neutralizing F(ab\u2032)2 decreased the viral loads in the spleens and brains. equine immunoglobulin and neutralizing F(ab\u2032)2 passive immunotherapy could be potentially useful for the treatment of patients infected with WNV."}
