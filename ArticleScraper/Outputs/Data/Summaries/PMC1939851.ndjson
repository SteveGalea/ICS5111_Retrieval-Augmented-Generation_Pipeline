{"summary": "influenza preparedness plans are currently being refined on national and international levels. the effectiveness of these interventions depends on various factors which must be explored by sensitivity analyses. the use of antiviral drugs during a pandemic seems to be the treatment of choice. the use of antiviral drugs during a pandemic seems to be the treatment of choice at present [9-12], but not all countries can afford stockpiling enough drugs. the program and its source code are publicly available [16] to offer transparency and reproducibility. the simulation produces time courses and cumulative numbers of influenza cases, outpatient visits, applied antiviral treatment doses (neuraminidase inhibitors), hospitalizations, deaths and work days lost due to sickness. interventions include antiviral treatment, isolation of patients, social distancing measures and the closing of day care centres and schools. 80% Longini (2004) treatment reduces hospitalizations by fH = 50% Kaiser (2003) Non-pharmaceutical interventions examined in this paper are contact reduction measures and the isolation of cases. a combination of antiviral treatment, isolation of cases and social distancing in the general population seems to be necessary to delay the epidemic. parameter values are based on the InfluSim standard configuration [15] with R0 = 2.5, except those listed at the end of this legend and indicated by superscripts1. The dashed line represents an epidemic without intervention2. treatment: antivirals are available for 10% of the population and all severe and extremely sick cases receive antiviral treatment4. unrestricted availability of drugs still leads to an epidemic. asymptomatic and moderately sick cases are not eligible for treatment. asymptomatic and moderately sick cases are not eligible for treatment. the mitigating effect of antiviral distribution is weakly influenced by the amounts of available antivirals. the mitigating effect becomes negligible, if antivirals are distributed with delay. delaying the epidemic depends on early action, whereby lowering the peak depends on the quantitative availability of antivirals. antiviral availability ranges from 0% (no antivirals available, dashed curves2) to 10% (antivirals available for 10% of the population3) bars at bottom of each graph indicate period when antiviral treatment begins (model input) until stockpiles are used up (model output). a peak shift is not only possible by early action, but also by the degree of contact reduction. if the intervention starts three weeks after the introduction of the infection, the peak of the epidemic is only mitigated by about half a day per 1% contact reduction. range of days: varied between A, B, and C. see legend or grey bar at bottom of each graph. intervention effect is based on Isolation alone, yielding Ni = 81%. antivirals are available for 10% of the population and are distributed from day zero2. the \"Day when contact reduction measures are initiated\" is model input, whereas the \"Day when antivirals are used up\" is model output. outpatients Without interventions, Ni = 87% of the population become infected during the course of the epidemic. the cumulative number of outpatients reaches No = 29%, reflecting the assumption that approximately one third of infected individuals become sufficiently sick to seek medical help. these outcomes remain surprisingly stable even for interventions assuming optimistic resources. the epidemic with N0 = 20800 is caused by parameter values drawn from the left tail of the corresponding distributions. the epidemic with N0 = 5000 is caused by parameter values drawn from the right tail of the corresponding distributions. for optimistic parameter combinations, the available stockpiles last over the whole period of the intervention and the epidemic curve proceeds without a plateau. in two out of 1,000 simulations the randomly chosen parameter combinations involved values for R0 around 1.8 which led to very minor outbreaks given the intervention scheme. the cumulative number of outpatients escalates when antiviral stockpiles become exhausted while the proportion of susceptibles is still large enough to allow for further propagation of infectives. the dashed curve shows the epidemic without intervention2. antivirals are available for 5% of the population3 (black lines) compared to scenarios of full coverage4 (grey lines) the shaded areas under the curves represent the amounts of antivirals distributed. the mitigating effect of antiviral distribution is weakly influenced by the amounts of available antivirals. the model suggests even a small stockpile of antivirals can protract the peak of the epidemic if distributed very early while few cases exist in the population. a peak of the epidemic is protracted by about 1 day for every percent of contact reduction if this intervention starts immediately after the introduction of the infection. the peak of the epidemic is only mitigated by about half a day per 1% contact reduction. contacts are reduced by 0%4 (grey curve) up to 30%5 in steps of 2%6 (black curves, from left to right) bars at bottom of each graph illustrate the periods of contact reduction. Combined intervention scheme The preceding examples with interventions based on antivirals or contact reduction alone yielded peak delays only in the order of weeks. a delayed initiation leads to a plateau in the epidemic curve at a time when antivirals are used up. \"21\", \"35\" and \"49\"5 are plotted in bold for purposes of visualization. influSim output: Ni = cumulative proportion of the population infected. treatment fraction: 100%, for both, Treatment of severe cases. a reduction of 20% of contacts reduces these fractions to Ni = 68%. a combination of antiviral treatment and contact reduction can further reduce these fractions to Ni = 53% and No = 22%. uncertainty arises from biological variability, stochastic influences, heterogeneities. the epidemic with N0 = 20800 is caused by parameter values drawn from the left tail of the corresponding distributions. the epidemic with N0 = 5000 is caused by parameter values drawn from the right tail of the corresponding distributions. for optimistic parameter combinations (e.g. small R0), the available stockpiles last over the whole period of the intervention and the epidemic curve proceeds without a plateau. s is still large enough to allow for further propagation of infectives. s is still large enough to allow for further propagation of infectives. the discussion of pandemic influenza preparedness planning has often focused on the amounts of drugs to be stockpiled and to whom they should be stockpiled. asymptomatic and moderately sick cases or even healthy people may seek medical help and succeed in receiving antiviral treatment which would further deplete the stockpile. these factors reduce the efficacy of pharmaceutical control measures [24], indicating the demand of extending this strategy by non-pharmaceutical intervention measures. especially if antivirals are limited, they should be supplied as early as possible. if their distribution is delayed, cases become so abundant that resources will quickly be exhausted without having much impact on the spread studies on the SARS outbreak suggest some preventative effect of wearing masks. but compliance, availability of masks and their effectiveness against influenza infection remain unknown factors. in contrast to SARS, we expect only a total of 0.7% of the population to be hospitalized. development of resistance, limited production capacities and extremely high costs are further limitations of this strategy. population-wide prophylaxis has not been recommended by the WHO for the final phase of the pandemic. if antiviral drugs are extremely limited, they should be used to preferably treat severe cases that need hospitalization. contact reduction Rather than relying on a pharmaceutical solution, pandemic preparedness should also involve non-pharmaceutical measures. early self-isolation and social distancing measures can be highly effective, as shown for the SARS epidemic [26] only a timely application of antiviral drugs and contact reduction measures will notably protract the peak of a pandemic influenza wave. a small fraction of the population with a pre-pandemic vaccine would have a similar effect on the course of the epidemic as reducing the basic reproduction number by the percentage of immunized individuals. infected individuals (E) incubate the infection for a mean duration of 1.9 days. the last 2 incubation stages are regarded as early infectious period. the last 2 incubation stages are regarded as early infectious period. infected individuals become fully infective and a fraction develops clinical symptoms. the course of disease depends on their age and risk group. the rationale for distinguishing extremely sick cases is that only these can die from the disease. very sick and extremely sick patients first become convalescent before they resume their normal life. asymptomatic and moderately sick patients first become convalescent before they resume their ordinary life. asymptomatic and moderately sick patients first become convalescent before they resume their ordinary life. reproduction number R0, the disease-specific infectivity and the durations of infectivity must be incorporated. force of infection is given as the product of the number of infective individuals. initial values At the start of the simulation, one infection is introduced into the fully susceptible population. contract no. 513715 (MS), the MODELREL project, funded by DG SANCO (no. 2003206 \u2013 SI 2378802) (MS, ME), and by the german Ministry of Health (MS, ME)."}
