{"summary": "the prevalence of DMD may be attributed to the high frequency of de novo mutations, which in turn is influenced by the size, nature, and organization of the dystrophin gene. many dystrophin introns are fivefold to eightfold larger than the average human gene of 30 kb pairs. this review will focus on novel therapeutic compounds invoking avenues of intervention to either restore or supplement dystrophin. each strategy offers different targets for intervention and some may be complementary. greatest benefit to patients is likely to be derived from dystrophin restitution; however, not all mutations will be amenable to molecular interventions. not yet recruiting NCT00758225 Extension study of ACE-031 in subjects with DMD December 2012 2 Recruiting by invitation NCT0123975813 Study of ACE-031 in subjects with DMD February 2012 2 Recruiting by invitation NCT0123975813 Phase III study of idebenone in (DMD) December 2011 3 Recruiting NCT01027884 Molecular therapies Dystrophin restitution: stop codon read-through A Phase IIa extension study corticosteroids have provided the best treatment option available to patients to date and have also been used in limb girdle and BMDs21\u201323. the use of corticosteroids in DMD is common and has been proposed as the \u2018gold standard\u2019. the availability of the mdx mouse33,34 and golden retriever muscular dystrophy dog35,36 models has led to extensive preclinical studies on potential therapeutics. the lack of standardized experimental end points for the mdx mouse37 and phenotypic variation in the dog model,38 together with the high cost of maintaining the dogs have made rigorous comparisons difficult. exercised mdx mice show a typical pattern of muscle weakness in vivo. conductance to chloride in mdx muscle is impaired by chronic exercise. long-term beneficial effects on dystrophic pathology in mdx mice have been reported. tadalafil, a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor, administered to mdx mice, ameliorated muscle damage. this has prompted a study of tadalafil in selected BMD patients. tadalafil has been identified as a major negative regulator of skeletal muscle mass. activins and myostatin signal through activin type II receptors (ActRIIA and ActRIIB) and their activities are regulated by follistatins and FLRG and by intracellular receptor-interacting proteins. ACE-031 is a recombinant, soluble form of the activin receptor composed of the extracellular domain of the ActRIIB receptor and the human immunoglobulin Fc region. patients are currently being recruited for a study to determine whether IGF-1 therapy improves or preserves muscle function in DMD. degradation of skeletal muscle extracellular matrix, inflammation, and fibrosis are the common pathological features in DMD. however, strategies to ameliorate dystrophic pathology are being considered. a monoamine oxygenase inhibitor reduced reactive oxygen species accumulation along with a beneficial effect on dystrophic phenotype and muscle strength in mouse muscular dystrophy models. a green tea polyphenol blend and derived extracts could protect primary mdx muscle cells from oxidative damage induced by hydrogen peroxide by scavenging H2O2. ubiquitous overexpression of utrophin in the mdx mouse was nontoxic,70 prompting the search for compounds to reactivate utrophin expression. bioMarin concluded that other approaches to the upregulation of utrophin may be more feasible. the use of gentamicin provided promising data when applied to nonsense mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator gene. the discrimination of a premature stop codon from a normal stop codon was considered possible, determined by the context of surrounding bases. potential renal and otic adverse effects associated with gentamicin exposure are well documented. 6-minute walk test failed to reach statistical significance during the trial. additional analysis is underway in patient subgroups. ataluren evaluation will continue for other conditions, including cystic fibrosis and hemophilia. dystrophin levels were increased for 6 months, with the highest levels reaching up to 15% of normal levels. one patient appeared to raise antibodies to the novel dystrophin protein. this study justifies and highlights the need for continued screening for compounds to safely induce read-through of premature termination codons. exon skipping therapy must be regarded as a personalized therapy because of the spread of different mutations across the dystrophin gene. there is little incentive to the private sector to develop and market specific therapies. bringing any drug to the clinic is costly and challenging. a high proportion of splice-switching AOs did induce some degree of exon skipping. one-third of splice-switching AOs initially designed failed to induce any detectable effect on dystrophin pre-mRNA processing. an appropriately designed splice-switching oligomer should induce specific exon skipping and generate a novel mRNA transcript. nonsense mutation in dystrophin exon 29 induced different levels of exon skipping in three affected boys. phenotypes in this family varied from healthy to severely affected. the loss of this exon does not disrupt the reading frame. different mutations across the dystrophin gene will require specific exon-skipping strategies, necessitating potential scores of oligomers. exon skipping must be regarded as a personalized therapy because of the spread of different mutations across the dystrophin gene. a major advantage in assessing changes in pre-mRNA processing is the appearance of a novel transcript. the disappearance or reduction in abundance of a gene transcript or protein is measured in a negative assay. a high proportion of splice-switching AOs failed to induce any detectable effect on dystrophin pre-mRNA processing. the concept of exon skipping is now so well established that the majority of recent reports on dystrophin splice switching do not include random, scrambled, or sense oligomer sequences as negative controls. exon skipping, assuming it can be induced at adequate efficiency in dystrophic muscle, would reduce the severity of most cases of DMD. AOs to induce targeted dystrophin exon skipping were first reported by Takeshima and colleagues. intraexonic deletion of 52 bp in dystrophin exon 19 left the acceptor and donor splice sites intact but resulted in the loss of the entire exon. early splice-switching studies targeted the obvious splice sites at the intron 22:exon 23 (acceptor or 3\u2032) and exon 23:intron 23 (donor or oligomer preparation that can induce pronounced exon skipping in cultured cells at 5 nM will be more effective than an oligomer that promotes weak exon removal after transfection at higher concentrations. in vitro evaluation of novel AOs has been widely used to select AO sequences for dystrophin exon skipping. directing AOs to pre-mRNA motifs does not necessarily induce comparable exon skipping. despite strong homology in the dystrophin genes of human, mouse, and dog, directing AOs to the pre-mRNA motifs does not necessarily induce comparable exon skipping. several hundred AOs have now been designed to the dystrophin pre-mRNA84,85. mechanisms by which antisense sequences influence exon recognition and splicing have still not been clearly defined. oligomer preparation that can induce pronounced exon skipping in cultured cells at 5 nM will be more effective than an oligomer that promotes weak exon removal after transfection at higher concentrations. in vitro evaluation has been widely used to select AO sequences for dystrophin exon skipping. a series of techniques to quantify exon skipping levels by RT-PCR were reported by Spitali and colleagues115. quantification of small primary PCR products generated data close to that from a digital array. this method will be of great value in allowing comparative quantification of sarcolemmal proteins. three clinical trials have been reported using ODN, 2-OMeAO, and PMOs. a large number and variety of reagents have been used to deliver charged AOs in vitro. uncharged PMOs are largely ineffective in vitro unless applied at high concentrations with scrape loading. the humanized mouse146 contains a complete copy of the human DMD gene integrated into chromosome 5 and has been promoted for preclinical screening of human-specific oligomers. the mdx mouse does not reflect clinical severity of DMD and the humanized mouse has a human dystrophin gene processed with rodent splicing machinery. GRMD canine model were reported after systemic administration of substantial amounts of a PMO cocktail to excise exons 6 and 8/9 to restore the reading frame around the exon 7 deletion. dystrophin expression in the heart was low or undetectable, presumably reflecting limitations of uptake. however, systemic administration of a single dose of an uncomplexed PMO at 3 g/kg resulted in dystrophin restitution in skeletal and cardiac muscles in the study may be attributed to several factors, including a readily available but less-than-optimal oligomer chemistry or insufficient dosage and duration of treatment to restore detectable dystrophin expression. 152 ODNs are typically used to downregulate gene expression through induction of RNAseH. RNA and protein were not possible since high-sensitivity RT-PCR conditions were employed. RNA and protein were not possible since high-sensitivity RT-PCR conditions were employed. unpublished data indicates low-level, widespread dystrophin expression after 12 weeks of treatment. exon 51 skipping was readily detected by RT-PCR in test biopsies from all participants. there was unequivocal dystrophin expression as determined by Western blotting and immunofluorescent staining. preliminary results from the AVI-4658 study were sufficiently encouraging to commence dose-escalating systemic administration in DMD participants. mice and canine models of muscular dystrophy have received different PMOs at substantial dosages of 200 mg/kg in the GRMD animal149 and 3 gm/kg in the mdx mouse. however, high PMO doses may offer a rapid restitution of dystrophin synthesis, but it is most unlikely that such amounts would be financially sustainable at this time. gentamicin treatment has produced promising results, but its use can beaccompanied by significant side effects that may limit long-term administration. nonsense mutation read-through is restricted to the 10% of cases caused by premature termination codons."}
