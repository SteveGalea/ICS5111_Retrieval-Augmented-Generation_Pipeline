{"summary": "Tanreqing injection (TRQ) is a widely used classical compound herbal recipe for several decades in china. it is composed of water soluble natural extractives from five crude herbal plants. it is a mixture of about 12 main active pharmaceutical ingredients. it is predominately used for acute inflammatory lung diseases. NF-B dimers are crucial for regulating transcription of diverse genes coding for cytokines including TNF-, IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8. the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is also activated during an LPS-challenged inflammatory condition. SD rats were raised on a 12 h light/dark cycle at a temperature of 22 2\u00b0C. protocol of this experiment was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of West China Hospital. the investigation conformed to the \"Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\" the chest cavity was opened by a midline incision to expose and cannulate the trachea. the right lobe of the lung was ligated at the hilus of the lung. the left lung was immediately lavaged three times with 2 mL ice sterile saline through the tracheostomy tube. alogue of human IL-8) (Cat.

RNA pellets were ethanol-precipitated, washed, and resuspended in sterile ribonuclease-free water. RNA samples were reverse transcribed using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) the PCR program was initiated by a 30 s of enzyme activation at 95\u00b0C and then 5 s of cDNA denaturation at 95\u00b0C. a melting-point curve was then measured, starting from 65\u00b0C and increasing by 4.4\u00b0C every second up to 95\u00b0C. the blots were blocked with 5% BSA in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween (TBST) for 2 h at room temperature. the blots were then washed three times for 5 min each in TBST. SD rats were raised under SPF conditions on a 12 h light/dark cycle at a temperature of 22 2\u00b0C with free access to food and water. protocol of this experiment was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of West China Hospital. the investigation conformed to the \u201cGuide for the care and use of laboratory animals\u201d [29]. rats were anaesthetised with 4% sodium pentobarbital (40 mg/kg) and then exsanguinated from the abdominal aorta. the chest cavity was opened by a midline incision to expose and cannulate the trachea. the right lobe of the lung was ligated at the hilus of the lung, and the left lung was immediately lavaged three times with 2 mL ice sterile saline through the Rat CXCL-1/CINC-1 ELISA kit (rat analogue of human IL-8) (Cat.

CINC-1 was accumulated with mRNA levels peaking at 24 h and then declining. al antibody in lung sections increased markedly at 24 h after LPS exposure. changes in p38 MAPK immunohistochemical staining could be attenuated by TRQ in a dose-dependent way. rats treated with LPS + TRQ 5.6 mL/kg at (j) 24 h, (k) 48 h, and (l) 96 h were analysed by haematoxylin and eosin staining. scale bars 50 m. Integrated option density sum (IOD sum) value of positive NF-B p65 staining. TRQ Suppresses LPS-Induced Phosphorylation of Signaling Proteins in NF-B Pathway in Rat Lungs. stimulation with LPS alone for 24 h notably induced the strong signal of the immunostained band for phosphorylated p65, IB-, and IKK/. inflammatory lesion scores decreased over time and were effectively decreased by TRQ administration in a dose-dependent way. rats exposed to LPS alone at (a) 24 h, (b) 48 h, and (c) 96 h, rats exposed to LPS at (d) 24 h, (e) 48 h, and (f) 96 h, rats treated with LPS + TRQ 2.8 mL/kg at (g) 24 h, (h) 48 h changes of AB/PAS staining in control rats at 24 h, 48 h, and 96 h. rats exposed to LPS alone at 24 h, 48 h, and 96 h were all analysed by AB/PAS staining. scale bars = 50 m; upper right insert = 25 m. low dose of TRQ effectively cut down the neutrophil release in BALF after LPS administration at 24 h. the number of lymphocytes in BALF enhanced observably after LPS administration. TRQ exerted a more potent and earlier effect on reversing the overproduction of IL-6, which was completely repressed at 48 h. CINC-1 was accumulated with mRNA levels peaking at 24 h and then declining. results revealed that IOD value of areas positively stained by p38 MAPK and NF-B p65 monoclonal antibody increased markedly at 24 h after LPS exposure. changes in p38 MAPK immunohistochemical staining in rat airways. rats treated with LPS + TRQ 2.8 mL/kg at (g) 24 h, (h) 48 h, and (f) 96 h. rats treated with LPS + TRQ 5.6 mL/kg at (j) 24 h, (k) 48 h, and (l) 96 h. Q was observed in all indicators. P 0.05 means significant difference from the control group. 3.6. TRQ Suppresses LPS-Induced Phosphorylation of signaling proteins in NF-B Pathway in rat lungs. both direct and indirect effects are modulated by the coordinated action of ERK, p38 MAPK, and NF-B pathways. ERK1/2, JNK, and IKK/NF-B pathways also contribute to macrophage migration. pretreatment with TNF inhibitors led to a reduction in circulating IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8. this suggests an important role of TNF- in the amplification of inflammatory response. IL-1 is also mainly produced and released from monocytes/macrophages. endotoxin-induced IL-6 functions to downregulate its own inducers, TNF- and IL-1 on mRNA and protein levels. as a result, the acute neutrophil and macrophage exudation would be diminished [53], realizing the protective role of IL-6 on endotoxin-induced inflammation. the therapeutic action of TRQ benefited from its inhibitory effect on the expressions of p38 MAPK, ERK1/2, IKK/, IB-, and NF-B p65 in lungs. authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
