{"summary": "the revised IHR outline specific minimum core public health capacities and implementation processes that nations need to adequately address acute public health threats. the initial target for full IHR implementation was 2012. even by 2014, only 33% of nations indicated that they had successfully implemented these minimum requirements. the united states has worked with GHSA partners and the WHO to develop a tool for conducting external assessments of countries' baseline health security capacity. the tool builds on the GHSA's focus areas to provide a standard metric by which countries can assess their current baseline capacities and measure future progress toward full development of IHR capabilities. national leaders should take a strong stand against imposition of non-evidence-based measures to control the spread of disease. the united states should lead by example by developing domestic plans for containing the spread of disease that have the strong backing of scientific evidence. the pandemic influenza plan is needed to understand the changing epidemiology of influenza outbreaks. the plan does not establish a global consensus for how countries should collect and share surveillance information and collaborate on research in the midst of acute infectious disease emergencies. the united states should work with WHO and its international partners to develop and adopt an international consensus framework of best practices. international engagement is vital to addressing disease threats before they ever reach our borders as well as mitigating their impact on the global economy and health."}
