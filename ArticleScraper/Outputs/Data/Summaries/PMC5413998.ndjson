{"summary": "METHODS Sampling Site Selection In this pilot study, we gained permission from collaborating institutions to study patient waiting areas in a busy pediatric hospital, a busy public primary care clinic, and a private primary care clinic. we ran 2 types of aerosol samplers during busy patient activity periods (morning and afternoon sessions) 1 day each week for 4 weeks. tetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) Teflon filter cassettes were prewetted with 100 L isopropanol. the pump was set at a flow rate of 5 L/min for 180 minutes. each filter was removed and swabbed with a flocked swab prewetted with sterile virus collection medium. RT-PCR was performed using the SuperScript III Platinum One-Step RT-PCR System with Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) for influenza A- and influenza B-positive specimens, 200 L of concentrated positive samples were inoculated into MDCK cells with Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM). positive PCR bands were purified using gel-based screening PCR targeting the hexon gene [15]. adenovirus-positive samples were inoculated into a 549 cells with DMEM 2% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 7 days. adenovirus-positive samples were inoculated into cells with DMEM 2% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and incubated for 7 days. personal sampler Two portable AirChek TOUCH personal air samplers were concomitantly run with the BioSampler (separate areas) the filters were prewetted with 100 L isopropanol to reduce hydrophobicity before use. each filter was removed from the cassette and swabbed with a flocked swab prewetted with sterile virus collection medium (PBS with 0.5% w/v BSA fraction V) biosamplers were run for 60 minutes to achieve a total sampled air volume of 480 liters. the filters were prewetted with 100 L isopropanol to reduce hydrophobicity. each filter was removed from the cassette and swabbed with a flocked swab. influenza A/B Virus Viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) was extracted using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Inc., Valencia, CA) and then assessed with real-time, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for influenza A- and influenza B-positive specimens, 200 L of concentrated positive samples were inoculated into MDCK cells. adenovirus-positive specimens were subtyped using gel-based screening PCR targeting the hexon gene [15] positive PCR bands were purified using a QIAquick PCR Purification kit (QIAGEN, Inc.) for adenovirus-positive samples, 200 L of concentrated positive samples were inoculated into A549 cells with DMEM 2% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 7 days adenovirus Viral deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was extracted using a QIAamp DNA Blood Mini kit (QIAGEN, Inc.) positive PCR bands were purified using gel-based screening PCR targeting the hexon gene [15] positive samples were inoculated into A549 cells with DMEM 2% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 7 days. the partial hexon sequence of this adenovirus-positive specimen was most similar (100% nucleotide identity) to human adenovirus 3 isolate GZ_31_2011. none of the 48 samples were positive for coronavirus.
