{"summary": "ubiquitin is a 76 amino acid protein that is best known for its role in protein degradation. ubiquitin is initially activated by one of two ubiquitin activating enzymes. ubiquitin is subsequently transferred to a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme. poxviruses employ a vast array of effective immune evasion strategies. the ease with which recombinant poxviruses are generated has made them attractive viruses for dissecting cellular signaling pathways. ubiquitin is a small 76 amino acid protein that is highly conserved in eukaryotes. two insect poxviruses: Melanoplus sanguinipes (MSEV) and Amsacta moorei (AMEV) contain virus-encoded ubiquitin homologs. BLAST analysis also identified an additional poxvirus-encoded ubiquitin gene AMEV180, in AMEV, a poxvirus that infects moths. ubiquitin genes have also been identified in Baculoviridae, a family of dsDNA viruses that infect insects. disruption of the ubiquitin gene in Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus has no effect on virus viability. however, a decrease in virion budding and total infectious particles was observed. virus MYXV-Lau M153 206 VP0038581 RFV-Kas gp153R 201 VP0040564 Yatapoxvirus TANV-COD 5 156 VP0067544 YLDV-Davis 5 156 VP0040054 YMTV-Amano 4 156 VP0043053 p28 Poxviral E3 Ubiquitin Ligase Avipoxvirus C 34 VP0067759 YMTV-Amano 143R 236 VP0043181 Unclassified Poxviridae DPV-W1170_84 154 245 VP0045437 BTB/KELCH proteins associated with cullin-3-based E3 ubiquitin ligase Capripoxvirus GTPV-Pellor 16 141 148 562 547 552 VP0044826 VP00449 206 107 487 VP0040376 VP0040382 VP0040396 TATV-DAH68 24 43 181 196 150 480 219 209 VP0052942 VP0052961 VP0053099 VP0053114 VACV-COP C2L C5L F3L A55R 512 615 480 564 VP0039555 VP0039551 VP0039572 VP0039751 0037956 VP0037961 VP0037962 VP0037965 VP0037966 VP0037967 VP0037968 VP0037974 VP0037977 VP0037978 VP0037980 Capripoxvirus GTPV-Pellor 142 144 145 149 634 498 447 453 VP0044952 VP0044954 VP0044955 VP00 ECTV-Mos 2 5 154 165 587 650 564 594 VP0040921 VP0040924 VP0041078 VP0041089 MPXV-ZAR B5R J1R N4R B17R 561 587 437 793 VP0040530 VP0040553 VP0040552 VP0040542 TATV-DAH68 220 187 18 6 640 558 661 627 VP0043056 VP0043184 VP0043186 Unclassified Poxviridae DPV-W1170_84 164 163 162 160 19 493 483 501 641 641 643 VP0045447 VP0045446 VP0045445 VP0045453 VP0045302 poxvirus APC/cyclosome regulators Molluscipoxvirus MOCV-st1 026L 83 VP enomopoxvirus (AMEV), Melanoplus sanguinipes entomopoxvirus (MSEV), Mule deer poxvirus (DPV), Nile crocodile poxvirus (CRV), Squirrel poxvirus (SPV) the complete VACV-IHD-W genome has not been published and an accession number is not available. lipid-modified ubiquitin may exist in cell membranes for a cellular function. entomopoxiruses and canarypox virus require a functional ubiquitin-proteasome system. ubiquitin homologs may also act as chain terminators to inhibit degradation of substrates. RING-CH (MARCH) ubiquitin ligase encoded by myxoma virus contains two transmembrane domains and a C-terminal RING-CH domain. p28 contains a C-terminal RING domain and an N-terminal KilA-N DNA binding domain. potential substrates are likely recruited through the kelch domain. p28 is a virus-encoded RING finger ubiquitin ligase that plays an important role in virulence. p28 is a virus-encoded RING finger ubiquitin ligase that plays an important role in virulence. p28 is highly conserved among pathogenic poxviruses and is expressed at both early and late times during virus infection. p28 homologs in ectromelia virus (ECTV), vaccinia virus (VV)-strain IHDW and variola virus (VARV) were shown to function as ubiquitin ligases [36,38]. p28 ortholog in variola virus, D4R, functions in vitro with the ubiquitin conjugating enzymes, Ubc4 and UbcH5c. variola virus D4R functions in vitro with Ubc13, the only known ubiquitin conjugating enzyme that promotes K63 linkages. p28 has been implicated in the inhibition of apoptosis [47,50] p28 may be targeting pro-apoptotic proteins during virus infection. a bona fide ubiquitin ligase suggests p28 is ubiquitinating substrates. however, these substrates have yet to be identified. p28 is a highly conserved protein-protein interaction motif that is involved in many cellular functions. x virus (CPXV) encodes six BTB/kelch proteins [63]. ectromelia virus strain Moscow (EVM) encodes four such proteins [64]. monkeypox virus (MPXV) encodes only one BTB/kelch gene [65]. poxviruses encode multiple BTB/kelch proteins with different kelch regions. Vaccinia virus devoid of the BTB/kelch proteins C2L, F3L or A55R displays an altered viral pathogenesis in the murine intradermal model. no definite substrates for the poxvirus BTB/kelch proteins have been identified. vaccina virus encoded BTB/kelch protein, WR026 (COP-C2L), was recently shown through yeast-2-hybrid screening to interact with cellular crystallin alpha B (CRYAB) the role of poxvirus BTB/kelch proteins is still undefined, but many other viruses have evolved mechanisms to specifically recruit cellular proteins to cullin-based ubiquitin ligases. the poxviral ankyrin repeat proteins contain no obvious structural domains at their C-termini. many of the proteins display a conserved sequence, which resembles the F-box domain that functions in the recruitment of substrates to the cellular SCF (Skp-1, cullin, F-box) ubiquitin ligase complex. wasp, Nasonia, Ank/PRANC proteins were thought to be unique to poxviruses. the proteins differ from cellular F-box proteins in two important aspects. ectromelia virus encoded Ank/PRANC proteins with cellular Skp2. studies on myxoma virus identified the first interaction between a poxviral Ank/PRANC protein, M-T5, and the SCF complex. MT-5, one of four Ank/PRANC proteins in myxoma virus, co-localizes with cullin-1 in the nucleus and regulates the cell cycle and interacts with Akt [95,96]. regulation of the NF-B signaling pathway by poxviral Ank/PRANC proteins appears to be a common trend. the variola virus encoded G1R Ank/PRANC protein was shown to interact with the NF-B regulatory protein NFB1/p105 as well as Skp1 [102] a CPXV006 deletion virus displayed increased release of proinflammatory cytokines in culture. anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) is the largest known cellular ubiquitin ligase complex. the complex has evolved from an ancestral SCF-type ubiquitin ligase. subunits APC2 and APC11 resemble a cullin-family member and RING-type E3 ligase. PACR was shown to co-precipitate with APC/C subunits APC2, APC3 and APC4. but on sequence analysis, PACR and other poxvirus orthologs contain mutations within the RING domain that inhibit the binding of E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes to the complex. ubiquitin-proteasome system plays crucial role in protein degradation and cellular homoeostasis. proteasome inhibitors block catalytic action of proteasome by preventing degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. bortezomib is a potent inhibitor of the proteasome. proteasome inhibitors block plasmid replication during poxviral infection. the addition of proteasome inhibitors post-infection indicates that the block affects an early step during poxviral infection. this suggests that a functional ubiquitin-proteasome system is required for successful poxvirus infection. proteasome inhibitors appear to demonstrate antiviral activity though distinct mechanisms among viral species. proteasome inhibitors have been shown to impair entry and RNA synthesis during coronavirus infection [119], inhibit the entry of herpes simplex virus into the nucleus [122], and inhibit influenza and vesicular stomatitis virus replication [118]. however, in vivo studies recently conducted have produced mixed results. the presence of multiple poxvirusencoded proteins suggests that poxviruses exploit the ubiquitin-proteasome in order to regulate cellular processes. the presence of multiple poxvirusencoded proteins suggests that poxviruses exploit the ubiquitin-proteasome in order to regulate cellular processes."}
