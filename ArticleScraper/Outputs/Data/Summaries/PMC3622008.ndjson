{"summary": "retrospective cohort study was performed of all hospitalized patients with a positive respiratory viral panel (RVP) for two or more viruses within 72 hours of admission at our institution from October 2009 to December 2009. co-infected patients were significantly younger, more often had fever/chills, tachypnea, and they more often demonstrated interstitial opacities suggestive of viral pneumonia on the presenting chest radiograph. co-infection occurs in 25\u201340% of children with bronchiolitis. infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and metapneumovirus is associated with a 10-fold greater likelihood of PICU level of care. one study found pH1N1 co-infection with rhinovirus correlated with a lower clinical severity, whereas pH1N1 co-infection with other viruses led to greater severity [48]. some have described an association between pH1N1 viral co-infection and poorer outcomes [48], [57], [58], whereas others have not demonstrated differences in outcomes. treatment for bacterial pneumonia was defined as reported in discharge diagnosis, chart review, or explicit use of antibiotics for this purpose. antibiotics empirically started and later discontinued did not fulfill this criterion. clinical history, laboratory data, medications, radiographic imaging, and hospital course were reviewed as previously described. patients co-infected with two or more viruses, excluded from the initial study, were the focus of this analysis. treatment for bacterial pneumonia was defined as reported in the discharge diagnosis, chart review, or the explicit use of antibiotics for this purpose. ANCOVA results report the covariate-adjusted F-test p-values and the adjusted outcome means with their standard errors and 95% confidence intervals. results A total of 1,192 inpatient RVP samples were performed from October 2009 to December 2009. pH1N1 was identified in 49% (24/49) of the co-infected group and 47% (290/617) of the mono-infected control group (p = 0.8). no seasonal influenza A H3 or influenza B was encountered in either group. all co-infected patients were under 60 years of age (Figure 1). Co-infected patients more frequently reported sick contacts (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1\u20133.6, p = 0.02) co-infected patients were more frequently HIV seropositive. 4 Antimicrobial agents pre-admission 18% (9) 24% (147) 0.8 [0.4\u20131.6].5 Duration of symptoms pre-admissionb 3.0 [2.4\u20133.8] 2.5 [2.3\u20132.7].1 Respiratory disease 47% (23) 45% (275) 1.4 [0.7\u20132.5].3 Asthma 27% (13) 37% (230) 0.8 [0.4\u20131.7].6 Hepatic diseasec 0.0% (0) 2.9% (18).6 Renal diseasec 0.0% 94% (46) 88% (545) 2.4 [0.7\u20138.1].2 Productive 10% (5) 18% (113) 0.9 [0.3\u20132.4].8 Nasal symptoms 74% (36) 57% (349) 1.6 [0.8\u20133.2].2 Sore throat 8.2% (4) 24% (145) 0.4 [.1\u20131.2].1 Headache 12% (6) 20% (121) 0.9 [0.4\u20132.4].9 Arthralgia 2.0% (1) 1.9% (12) 2.1 [0.3\u201317.3 e Co-infected (n = 41) Mono-infected (n = 531) Odds Ratio [95% CI] p-value NAD 22% (9) 51% (273) 0.3 [0.1\u20130.7].003 IO 61% (25) 16% (86) 7.5 [3.4\u201316.5].001 FASD 29% (12) 20% (105) 1.7 [0.8\u20133.4].1 MFASDc 0% (0) 9.6% (51).05 Edemac 0% more co-infected patients received antibacterial agents compared to mono-infected patients. more co-infected patients received antibacterial agents compared to mono-infected patients. halers 63% (31) 53% (324) 1.6 [2.6\u20132.9].1 Complications 37% (18) 23% (142) 3.5 [1.8\u20137.0].001 Treatment for bacterial pneumonia alone 31% (15) 9.2% (57) 6.8 [3.3\u201314.2].001 Death 2.0% (1) 1.1% (7) 4.0 [0.4\u201335.2].2 a Odds Ratios not computed on variables with zero occurrences in a cell category. pH1N1, 71% had rhinovirus, 8.3% RSV A, 4.2% RSV B, 4.2% adenovirus, 4.2% metapneumovirus, 4.2% parainfluenza II, and 4.2% with parainfluenza IV. co-infected pH1N1 patients were more likely to be immunocompromised, particularly with HIV infection. contacts 54% (13) 43% (124) 1.4 [0.6\u20133.2].5 Visited an emergency department or clinic pre-admission 54% (13) 49% (143) 1.1 [0.5\u20132.6].8 Antimicrobial agents pre-admission 17% (4) 24% (69) 0.6 [0.2\u20131.8].6 Respiratory disease 54% (13) 47% (135) 1.5 [0.6\u20133.5].4 Asthma 33% (8) 40% (115) 1.0 [0.4\u20132.4].9 conjunctivitis 8.3% (2) 1.0% (3) 7.3 [1.1\u201347.2].04 Rashc 0.0% (0) 4.5% (13).1 Cough 96% (23) 91% (264) 2.5 [0.3\u201319.7].4 Productive 17% (4) 23% (66) 1.1 [0.3\u20133.6].8 Sore throat 8.3% (2) 32% (92) 0.2 [.1\u20131.02].05 Headache 21% (5) 30% (86) 0.8 [0.3\u20132.3].7 Myal 1291.2 Initial respiratory rate (/min) 312 281.1 Maximum respiratory rate (/min) 342 321.3 Admission chest plain film performed 83% (20) 88% (256) 0.8 [0.3\u20132.6].7 Comparison of Chest Radiograph Results e Co-infected (n = 20) Mono-infected (n = 256) Odds Ratio [95% CI] p-value NAD 25% (5) 59% (152) 0.3 [0.1\u20130.7].01 IO 5 fected with pH1N1 were more likely to experience complications and to receive treatment for a secondary bacterial pneumonia (OR 6.3, 95% CI 2.5\u201315.8, p0.001; Table 5). compared to pH1N1 mono-infection. 4% (13) 38% (110) 2.7 [1.1\u20136.7].03 Treatment for bacterial pneumonia alone 46% (11) 14% (41) 6.3 [2.5\u201315.8].001 Death 4.2% (1) 2.1% (6) 3.3 [0.4\u201330.7].3 Odds Ratios not computed on variables with zero occurrences in a cell category. PH1N1 co-infected patients were more likely to present with interstitial opacities consistent with a viral pneumonia. there were no differences in admission to any ICU, ICU length of stay, or duration of hospitalization. this association is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. patients with respiratory virus co-infection may have an absence of protective antibodies or other forms of immunity from limited past exposure to viral pathogens. co-infection may be associated with differences in disease manifestation and complications, particularly chest radiographic changes suggestive of viral. co-infection with pH1N1 has a known association with bacterial pneumonia. co-infection with pH1N1 carries the greatest risk for this complication."}
