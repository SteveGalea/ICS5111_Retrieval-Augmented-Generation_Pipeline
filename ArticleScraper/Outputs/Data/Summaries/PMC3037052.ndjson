{"summary": "many countries have adopted policies to mitigate the effects of global warming on infectious diseases. cold weather, heat waves, and increased seasonal temperature variations have caused substantial numbers of deaths among vulnerable people all over the world. many studies focused on the effects of climate change on epidemiology, physiology and public health. a healthy individual will be able to effectively cope with thermal stress through the efficient regulation of heat. changes in blood pressure, blood viscosity, and heart rate associated with physiological adjustments to cold and warmth may explain the temperature-induced increase in mortality due to cardiovascular diseases. studies have shown that human health is significantly affected by the level of and variation in climate-related variables. this implies that the level and variation in temperature are the two major factors affecting the mortality related to cardiovascular diseases. however, very few studies have tried to empirically investigate the effects of changes in climatic conditions on mortality. figures 1 to 3 have provided strong evidence of a significant relationship between climatic conditions and the number of deaths from cardiovascular diseases. the magnitude of such effects needs to be further investigated to clarify the policy implications for the government. deathit is the monthly number of deaths from cardiovascular disease in region i in period t. SEASONit is a seasonal dummy variable, which equals 1 for the winter season. HEALTHIN is a dummy variable for health insurance, which equals 1 when national health insurance is implemented. the monthly number of deaths from cardiovascular diseases in a region ranges from 0 to 271 persons with an average of about 55 persons. the average monthly temperature is about 23.38 degrees Celsius, which seems to be favorable for human beings. the minimum average temperature occasionally falls down to 13 degrees Celsius and the maximum at times reaches up to 31 degrees Celsius. people with cardiovascular diseases have a higher risk of mortality in cold days compared to non-cold days. the mean of the COLDDAY variable is about 3.68 days, while the maximum could reach as many as 30 days. the other extreme event is called MINTEMP which measures the average of the lowest daily temperature. 0.231*** (0.032) log VARTEMP 0.031 (0.037) 0.226*** (0.051) log MINTEMP 0.099 (0.149) 1.516*** (0.206) log RAIN 0.000 (0.003) 0.053*** (0.004) logWET 0.282*** (0.083) 0.749*** (0.106) log COLDDAY 0.142 (0.092) 0.277* (0.157) log POP 0.308*** (0.010) 0.575*** (0.00 climate change scenarios on temperature can be used to calculate the effects of climate change on the mortality of cardiovascular diseases in Taiwan. the best estimated temperature rise is 1.8 \u00b0C with a likely range of 1.1 to 2.9 \u00b0C for scenario B1, while the best estimated temperature rise is 2.4 \u00b0C with a likely range of 1.4 to 3.8 \u00b0C for scenario B2. we adopted the lowest value (1.2%) and the middle value (4.1%) of the estimated range to evaluate the economic impacts of climate change on cardiovascular diseases. a two-step estimation approach is applied to estimate the effects of climate change on cardiovascular diseases in Taiwan. i in period t, MINTEMPit is the monthly mean of the daily lowest temperature in region i in period t, WETit is the relative humidity in region i in period t, COLDDAYit is the monthly cold days with the lowest daily temperature below 12 degrees Celsius in region i in period t.

Based on the Hasuman test, the fixed effects model is rejected which indicates that the random effects model is an appropriate model. the first finding is that the number of deaths from cardiovascular diseases will decrease by 0.231% if the average monthly temperature goes up. healthIC 0.172*** (0.013) 0.238*** (0.014) log ATTTEMP* log VARTEMP 0.011 (0.011) 0.071 (0.016) SEASON* log VARTEMP 0.099** (0.043) 0.132*** (0.051) SEASON* log VARTEMP 0.040 (0.086) 0.213* (0.123) Adjusted R2 0.906 0.557 Hausman Test 10.389 Note: the numbers in the parent the best estimated temperature rise is 1.8 \u00b0C with a likely range of 1.1 to 2.9 \u00b0C for scenario B1. the best estimated temperature rise is 2.4 \u00b0C with a likely range of 1.4 to 3.8 \u00b0C for scenario B2. for the two pessimistic scenarios, the best estimated temperature rise is 2.8 \u00b0C. the CVM was originally proposed by Davis [14] to evaluate the value of non-market or environmental goods. it allows one to elicit from individuals a definite indication of their preferences when it is difficult to observe this behavior in an existing market. the results could lead to compensated measurements of welfare. a total of 30 people were sampled in this pretest. we ranked the WTP of these valid samples and selected 13 groups to be the designated bids. the probability of death from cardiovascular diseases would increase by a range of 1.2% to 4.1% due to the future climate change in Taiwan. each respondent was asked to fill out a questionnaire to reduce the probability of death from cardiovascular diseases affected by climate change. 12.7% of correspondents were suffering from cardiovascular diseases at the time of the survey. at least 91% of correspondents had a regular health check. but only 35% of correspondents had a regular health check. the respondent\u2019s health checking status (1:yes;
