{"summary": "arachnid secretions amount to 800 isolated and characterized native and recombinant biologically active polypeptides. most of them are endowed with strongly stabilized structure, but their total number was estimated to reach 100 000 different ones. new world scorpions, with a pentagonal-shaped sternum, are widely dispersed in Europe, Asia, and America. the occurrence of scorpion stings in humans was estimated to one million people with a fatality risk of about 3, annually. the newworld scorpion' envenoming induces much cellular lyses, necrosis, and ulcers such as those caused by scorpionism. scorpion derivatives with enzymatic activities are less represented. the total peptide contained in the venom did not exceed 5% of its dried weight. a broad range of bioactive peptides are already purified from scorpion venoms, with a total number estimated to approach 100 000 different ones.

SVAP increases the generation of prostaglandin I2 which is an important thrombosis regulator. further clinical and experimental findings accounted for the perturbation of the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and prostanoids production. charybdotoxin acts by decreasing the prothrombinase activity. a pool of bradykinin potentiating peptides inhibit the downbreaking of the endogenous bradykinin and the synthesis of the angiotensin II. hypotensins, extracted from the Tityus serrulatus scorpion venom, induced hypotension but without intervening in the angiotensin converting enzymes activity. this mechanism of action is thought to be mediated via nitric oxide releasing. a peptide (ShK (L5) isolated from the sea anemone (Stichodactyla helianthus) suppresses proliferation of human and rat TEM cells and inhibits IL-2 production at very low doses. this peptide is able to prevent the experimentally induced encephalomyelitis and suppress the hypersensitivity in rats. e production in human polymorphonuclear granulocytes at submicromolar concentrations. mechanism of such effect is mediated by the Rac receptor involved in Chemotaxis and exocytosis stimulation. the -helical amphipathic sheet of the scorpion AMP permits its insertion into the membrane to trigger the G proteins activation. scorpion-derived peptides have been shown to exert potent anti-HIV actions via the inhibition of chemokines receptors CCR5- and CXCR4-mediated activities. these findings might improve the anti-AIDS therapy. potassium effluxes blockers are recruited to prevent neurological signs and symptoms evoked in multiple sclerosis. toxins acting on ion permeability of nerves membranes are sought to be in the top focus for neurological drug discovery. in multiple sclerosis, there is destruction of myelin sheath of the nerves. dopaminergic 119, 120 and G protein coupled like adrenergic and cholinergic receptors. these neurotoxin interactions may prompt dopamine receptors targeting for treating schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease [123]. cancer Cytotoxic compounds that kill cells or repress their growth are a required attribute for cancer and malignant diseases chemotherapy [124]. scorpion toxins are dotted with high specificity to targeted cells receptors. the chlorotoxin triggers gene transfection for cancer cells therapy. the list of scorpion peptides exhibiting anti-proliferative and cytotoxic effects is expanding. phase I trials have been advanced using Pertussis toxin as \"adjuvant\" before radical cystectomy in bladder carcinoma. they have promising effects against micrometastasis and neoplastic regeneration. at some extent, they are also used for various objectives in cancer treatments. in vitro and in vivo transplantation mice, a scorpion venom exhibited potential antitumoral activity against Lewis lung cancer cells. a PESV fraction from a scorpion venom exhibited potential antitumoral activity against Lewis lung cancer cells which were inoculated. Scorpion venom and hemolymph offer an extendable inventory of polypeptides with diverse array of bioactivities and high specificity to definite elements of the cell. these polypeptides are often of low molecular weights and compactly stabilized with disulphide bridges. phase I trials have been advanced for some peptides. experiments will isolate and characterize the substance in need and improve its efficacy and safety. the art of this plan is the distillation of the tremendous researches in scorpiology toward clinical applications.
