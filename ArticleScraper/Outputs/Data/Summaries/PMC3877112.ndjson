{"summary": "results Peaks in respiratory ICU admissions lasted longer than peaks in ILI incidence rates. in the Netherlands, predicting influenza epidemics in the general population was imprecise. hospitalization for laboratory confirmed Influenza was notifiable in the Netherlands. in the season 2009/2010 as well as in the season 2010/2011, hospital admission for influenza is not notifiable anymore and in the Netherlands SARI cases are not routinely collected. in the Netherlands, an influenza epidemic is defined as more than 5.1 patients with ILI per 10,000 inhabitants per week consulting the GP for at least two consecutive weeks. in the Netherlands, an influenza epidemic is defined as more than 5.1 patients with ILI per 10,000 inhabitants per week consulting the GP for at least two consecutive weeks. the APACHE II reason for ICU admission diagnosis is registered and sent to the NICE registry on a monthly basis. there is currently no distinct variable describing whether an ICU patient has influenza like illness or was diagnosed with an influenza virus infection. we defined an ICU admission with a possible SARI. Statistical Analysis \u2013 Association between ICU and ILI Data To explore the association between the weekly incidence of ILI patients and the incidence of ILI over the period January 1, 2003, through December 31, 2011. the dependent variable was weekly incidence of patients with ILI, and the independent variables were chronological week number, percentage of ICU admissions with respiratory infection in the current week and one to five weeks after the current week. we used data of the first three influenza years (january 1, 2003, through June 30, 2005) to generate the final model for predicting the incidence of ILI one week ahead. in each of these models, independent variables were removed by pseudo stepwise selection [14], using a fixed scheme for removal. from the fourth influenza year onward, the predicted incidence of ILI patients was plotted together with the observed incidence of ILI patients. from the fourth influenza year onward, the predicted incidence of ILI patients was plotted together with the observed incidence of ILI patients. the sine term was sin(k2t/T) and the cosine was cos(k2t/T) we adjusted for autocorrelation in the residuals, where the unit of clustering was influenza year. we calculated the average time lag between the sentinel GP and ICU data by computing the weighted average of the time lag. we used data of the first three influenza years (january 1, 2003, through June 30, 2005) to generate the final model for predicting the incidence of ILI one week ahead. to accomplish this, we varied the decay factor of the full model, giving weeks further back in time exponentially lower weights, from 0.97 to 1.00 with increments of 0.005. we also predicted the weekly incidence of ILI with models that used only seasonal terms and auto-regressive ILI variables. the resulting PPV and sensitivity were also calculated. the statistical analyses were performed using the statistical package R, version 2.15.1. the amplitude of the yearly peaks in the ICU data was relatively lower than ILI peaks, and often lasted for a longer time period. peaks in the ICU data were relatively lower than ILI peaks, and often lasted for a longer time period. if the percentage of ICU admissions with a respiratory infection in the current week increased by one percent then the incidence of ILI in the general population increased by 0.11 per

respiratory infection in the current week increased by one percent, then the incidence of ILI in the general population increased by 0.11 per 10,000 population. also ICU admissions one week later was

(PPV) and the percentage of medical ICU admissions for respiratory infections on average preceded the increase in the incidence of ILI by 1.68 days. despite this precedence, our analyses showed that with the current models ICU data do not accurately predict influenza epidemics in the general population. a study by van den Wijngaard et al. did not aim to predict influenza epidemics. but instead explored whether excesses in influenza severity per season can be detected by combining GP, hospital, laboratory, and mortality data. combining these data sources is of added value allowing for better understanding of increases in severe morbidity and mortality due to influenza infections. we extracted admissions with a medical respiratory infection, admitted to the ICU within two days after hospital admission, and excluding readmissions. the data of the sentinel GP registry is weekly updated, whereas the NICE registry is updated on a monthly basis. this delay is too long and more frequent updates are needed. ICU data on respiratory infections was associated with ILI incidence, with highest association in the same week and in the week before and the week after. increases in ICU data on average occur two days sooner and for longer time period than increases in ILI. ICU capacity prediction when an (severe) influenza epidemic is present."}
