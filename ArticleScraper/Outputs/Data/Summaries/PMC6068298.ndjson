{"summary": "heparinized blood samples applied for biochemical tests were used in this study. information including the patient\u2019s signalment, body condition score (5 points scale), diagnosis and undergoing treatment was obtained from the veterinary medical record or from the veterinarians in charge. the PCR conditions were the same as the first PCR. the second set of PCR products were electrophoresed in 2% agarose. the nucleotide sequence was determined by the dye terminator method. 3\u2032 fragment amplification Reverse_1 ggtggaacaattcctgtacct 2371\u20132351 Sense_2 agactgtgaagctgtacgag 1220\u20131239 For 3\u2032 fragment amplification Reverse_2 cctgaaactcttagcaccaag 2981\u20132961 For nested PCR Sense_3 agttggaagatggcga PBMCs were collected and washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) human embryonic kidney cells 293 (HEK293) [12] and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK) were also used for western blotting. samples were stored at 20\u00b0C until use. membranes were washed with 1 x TBS-T and incubated with 1 x TBS-T (1:1,000) at 4\u00b0C overnight. expression of recombinant canine SIRT1 protein could be detected by flow cytometry using the monoclonal antibody 1F3 against human SIRT1. the canine SIRT1 expression plasmids were transfected into 293T cells. the plasmids were sub-cloned into pcDNA3.1 (+) using X-tremeGENE HP DNA Transfection Reagent (Roche Diagnotics, Basel, Switzerland) the culture medium was removed and the cells were detached using TrypeLE express. the cells were incubated with 1F3 monoclonal antibody (1:200), anti-actin monoclonal antibody (8224, Abcam; 1:200) as a positive control. the cells were washed and incubated with phycoerythrin conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1: 1,000) for 20 min at room temperature. PCR was performed using a PureLink RNA Mini Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, U.S.A.) primer pairs were designed to amplify two overlapping DNA fragments that cover the whole predicted canine SIRT1 coding region by nested and semi-nested PCR. canine SIRT1 transcript variants were amplified using a 5\u2032-terminal inverse PCR amplification. the 5\u2032-end of canine SIRT1 cDNA was amplified using a 5\u2032-Full RACE Core Kit (Takara) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. gttggaagatggcggacga 90\u2013109 For 5\u2032 fragment amplification Reverse_3 ggcatattcaccacctaacc 1580\u20131561 Sense_2 agactgtgtgtacgag 1220\u20131239 For 3\u2032 fragment amplification Reverse_1 ggtggaacaattcctgtacct 2371\u20132351 For 5\u2032-RACE RT-primer ( the membranes were washed with Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween. the membranes were then incubated in 1 x TBS-T supplemented with nonfat Dry milk. the membranes were washed with TBS-T and chemiluminescence was detected with ECL Prime Western Blotting Detection System. expression of recombinant canine SIRT1 protein could be detected by flow cytometry using the monoclonal antibody 1F3 against human SIRT1. the cells were incubated with 1F3 monoclonal antibody (1:200), anti-actin monoclonal antibody (8224, Abcam; 1:200) at 4\u00b0C for 30 min. the cells were washed and incubated with phycoerythrin conjug. ated goat anti-mouse IgG (1: 1,000) for 20 min at room temperature. the cells were then washed with PBS and flow cytometry analysis was performed using cellQuest pro software. two DNA fragments were amplified. one variant starts at nucleotide 456 (named Variant 2, INSD accession No. LC342296) of the predicted canine SIRT1 mRNA (XM_546130.4) and the other starts at nucleotide 626 (named Variant 3, INSD accession No. LC342297; Fig. 1). canine SIRT1 was detected at 128 kDa in human HEK293 cells (white arrowhead), at 120 kDa in canine MDCK cells (black arrowhead) and at 117 kDa in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from two dogs (gray arrowheads) canine SIRT1 expression was examined by flow cytometry after fixation and permeabilization. SIRT1 expression in neutered female dogs was higher than that in intact- female and intact-male dogs (P0.05). intracellular SIRT1 was detected by 1F3 anti-human SIRT1 antibody. the fluorescent intensity histograms with anti-SIRT1 antibody (filled area), anti-actin antibody (gray line) and isotype control (dashed line) are shown in each panel. to 434 of the predicted sequence were not present (named Variant 1, INSD accession No. LC342295) this deleted region is within exon 1 and does not cause a codon frame shift downstream of the transcript. two DNA fragments were amplified. canine SIRT1 was detected at 128 kDa in human HEK293 cells (white arrowhead), at 120 kDa in canine MDCK cells (black arrowhead) and at 117 kDa in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from two dogs (gray arrowheads) a single band of approximately 120 kDa was detected in each cell line. correlation between SIRT1 expression and age, gender, degree of obesity was not statistically significant. SIRT1 expression in neutered female dogs was higher than that in intact- female and intact-male dogs (P0.05). PBMCs were collected and permeabilized for intracellular SIRT1 staining with 1F3 anti-human SIRT1 antibody. Flow cytometry analysis of SIRT1 expression in peripheral blood lymphocytes from client-owned dogs. the deduced molecular size of the canine SIRT1 protein was 70.9 kDa (Variant 1) and 62.1 kDa (Variants 2 and 3) the deduced molecular size of human SIRT1 was 81.6 kDa. study examined intracellular SIRT1 level in peripheral blood lymphocytes for ease of access in clinical cases. the significance of the plasma SIRT1 concentration remains to be clarified because SIRT1 localizes mainly in the nucleus or the cytoplasm. flow cytometry used -actin as an internal control for evaluating SIRT1 expression. the compensated SIRT1 expression level markedly varied among individual dogs. the level in neutered female dogs was higher than intact-female and intact-male dogs. this antibody was examined by flow cytometry using this antibody. it is applicable for further research evaluating the effect of intervention on potentially fluctuating SIRT1 expression in dogs."}
