{"summary": "TEXT lower respiratory tract infections are the leading cause of infectious disease-related hospitalization in the united states. patients enrolled in the study were admitted to a public or private hospital, and respiratory virus infections were identified by cell culture and serologic studies. the details of the clinical study have been described previously (5). the cell culture assays were tested for type A and B influenza viruses, parainfluenza virus (PIV) types 1 to 3, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinoviruses, enteroviruses, herpesviruses, and adenoviruses. RT-PCR assays were performed using previously described real-time RT-PCR assays for influenza A and B viruses and coronaviruses OC43 and 229E (3) infections identified by culture included seven A/H3N2, three each of RSV, PIV2, PIV3, and OC43, and one each of A/H1N1, PIV1, and 229E. culture systems were not available for OC43 or HMPV at the time of the original study. 200 (49.6%) of the 403 illnesses were associated with at least one virus infection. more than one virus infection was identified in 33 illnesses. a viral infection was identified in 77.6% of children under 5 years of age. 0 0 1 3 Coronaviruses OC43 0 0 0 1 6 0 7 229E 0 0 0 0 1 2 3 Adenoviruses 1 1 0 1 1 0 3 Any virusb 43 44 31 24 42 16 200 Multiple viruses 11 7 4 4 3 4 33 a PIV, parainfluenza virus; RSV, respiratory syncytial virus; HMPV, human metapneumovirus; CMV, cytome more than 75% of respiratory illnesses in children less than 5 years of age were associated with the detection of a respiratory virus. the prevalence of respiratory viral infections may have been even higher since we did not assay for NL63 or HKU1 coronaviruses or PIV type 4."}
