{"summary": "a variety of mind\u2013body training programs have been reported to decrease perceived stress and improve mood [1]. mindfulness-based stress reduction and healing arts programs have shown significant effects with regard to anxiety, anger, overall stress symptoms, and mood disturbances. the current online MBT program was designed to incorporate physical and emotional relaxation exercises, physical movements, deep breathing exercises, and meditation practices suitable for a healthy population. the current online program was designed to incorporate physical and emotional relaxation exercises, physical movements, deep breathing exercises, and meditation practices. the impact of implementing online training in a time-compressed fashion, based on 10 minutes a day, is unknown. we hypothesized that this online MBT would have beneficial effects involving stress reduction, increased use of adaptive coping strategies, increased emotional intelligence, and enhanced resilience. subjects who had participated in any kind of MBT in the previous 3 months were excluded from the study. the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Seoul National University Hospital. the experimental and control groups were recruited via notices posted on the bulletin board of the hospital. the first phase, brain relaxation exercise 1, was designed to enhance flexibility and blood circulation through stretching the muscles of the body. it consists of postures and motions that help relax the neck, shoulders, and lower back which can easily become tight when workers are exposed to conditions associated with burnout. the second phase, brain relaxation exercise 2, was also designed to enhance flexibility and blood circulation through stretching the muscles of the body. the eighth phase, meditation for balanced brainwaves, is aimed at converting the beta waves associated with stress to the alpha waves associated with relaxation and concentration. participants recall the image of a negative experience and notice its position and size. the experimental subjects repetitively practiced each of the 10 phases four times over the course of 8 weeks. the Cronbach's alpha for the eight subscales ranged from 0.27 to 0.82. the inventory consists of 39 items (score range: 0\u2013156) categorized into 7 factors: fatigue, tension, frustration, anger, depression, somatization, and aggression. higher scores indicate higher levels of perceived stress. the Cronbach\u2019s alpha in the current study for the three subscales ranged between 0.63 and 0.93: problem solving (0.93), social support (0.92) and avoidance (0.63) the Cronbach\u2019s alpha in the current study for the three subscales ranged between 0.63 and 0.93. the scale was categorized into five factors, each of which consisted of 10 questions: emotional perception and expression, empathy, emotional thinking, emotional application, and emotion regulation. Split-half reliability coefficients ranged from r = 0.80 to 0.91; the value for the entire measure was r = 0.91 in a previous study. the Cronbach's alpha in the current study was 0.89 for the full scale. Factor 2 corresponds to trust in one\u2019s instincts, tolerance of negative affect, and the strengthening effects of stress. Factor 4 is related to control and Factor 5 to spiritual influences. the Cronbach\u2019s alpha for the five subscales ranged between 0.19 and 0.83. psychiatric disorders among the participants were assessed using the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R) [33] and participants who scored higher than 70 (in T-scores) were excluded from this study. subjects who were currently participating or who had participated in any kind of MBT in the previous 3 months were excluded. the program was based on mind\u2013body training, a kind of movement-based meditation designed to facilitate the relaxation of the mind and the release of negative emotions through natural rhythmic movements and a focus on bodily sensations. the program consists of 10 phases: brain relaxation exercise 1, brain relaxation exercise 2, meditation with self-watching, energy-focused meditation, and meditation for emotional release. the sixth phase, meditation with self\u2013watching, is performed to relax muscular tension. participants focus on each part of the body to increase relaxation as the instructor names it. the seventh phase, energy-focused meditation, involves feeling the energy of the body and establishing peace of mind. the KOSS includes forty-three items (score range: 0\u2013100) scored using conventional 1-2-3-4 Likert scores. the following eight subscales developed through factor analysis and a validation process. internal consistency alpha scores ranged from 0.51 to 0.82 in a previous study. the CSI addresses a broad range of problem- and emotion-focused coping strategies that people might use in dealing with stressful situations. the inventory consists of 33 items rated on a three-point self-administered scale: not at all (1), a little (2), and a lot (3). problem-solving coping is problem focused, avoidance coping is emotion focused and social support coping can either be problem or emotion focused. the Cronbach's alpha coefficient for internal consistency was 0.84 in a previous study. the scale was categorized into five factors, each of which consisted of 10 questions. each question was scored on a 5-point Likert-type scale. the Cronbach's alpha for the five subscales ranged from 0.86 to 0.90 for PA and 0.84 to 0.87 for NA in a previous study. the Connor\u2013Davidson Resilience Scale (CDRS) comprises 25 items (score range: 25\u2013125), each rated on a 5-point scale (range: 1\u20135) Factor 1 (tenacity for high standards) corresponds to trust in one\u2019s instincts, tolerance of negative affect, and the strengthening effects of stress internal consistency alpha scores ranged from 0.51 to 0.82 in a previous study. the Cronbach's alpha for the eight subscales ranged between 0.27 and 0.82. the inventory consists of 39 items (score range: 0\u2013156) categorized into 7 factors. the Cronbach\u2019s alpha in the current study for the three subscales ranged between 0.63 and 0.93: problem solving (0.93), social support (0.92) and avoidance (0.63) the Cronbach\u2019s alpha in the current study for the three subscales ranged between 0.63 and 0.93. each question was scored on a five-point Likert-type scale. the scale was categorized into five factors, each of which consisted of 10 questions. each question was scored on a 5-point Likert-type scale. Factor 1 reflects the notion of personal competence, high standards, and tenacity. Factor 2 corresponds to trust in one\u2019s instincts, tolerance of negative affect, and the strengthening effects of stress. Factor 4 is related to control and Factor 5 to spiritual influences. there were no significant baseline differences between the two groups. stress, emotional intelligence, resilience, anger, positive

and perceived stress. however, this correlation was not found in the control group at baseline. 8-week variations indicated changed scores which were calculated by subtracting baseline scores from 8-week scores. positive scores in 8-week variations mean increased scores but negative scores indicate decreased scores. the 8-week online MBT program evaluated in this study resulted in significant effects. reduction in stress associated with MBT can be understood in terms of the decrease in tension, frustration, anger, depression, and somatization during the 8 weeks. the effects of MBT seem to be related to improvements in psychological capabilities. most subjects in both groups were nurses involved in emotional labor and caring staff, who worked in the hospital. a small increase in job-demand stress may have contributed to an increase in the perceived stress of some subjects in the control group. we can infer that a small increase in job-demand stress may have contributed to an increase in the perceived stress of some subjects. emotional intelligence, including emotional perception and expression, may be important for those engaged in emotional labor. reduction in stress and increase in emotional intelligence associated with MBT may contribute to the ability of those involved in professions that require high levels of emotional labor to self-regulate. the healthy brain has a considerable capacity for resilience based on its ability to respond to interventions designed to open \"windows of plasticity\" and redirect its function toward better health. adaptive coping strategies such as problem-solving and social-support strategies appeared to increase stress resistance in our subjects. subjects who participated in this 8-week online program underwent a much shorter training period than subjects in the previous offline MBT study who had been practicing meditation for a mean of 43 months. some differences between the two studies are to be expected. however, as this online program decreased stress, increased adaptive coping strategies, increase emotional intelligence, and enhance resilience, additional research comparing the online with the offline approach is needed. the results of this study suggest that an online MBT program may be beneficial in fostering diverse psychological capabilities including the enhancement of stress resistance, the use of adaptive coping strategies, emotional intelligence, and resilience."}
