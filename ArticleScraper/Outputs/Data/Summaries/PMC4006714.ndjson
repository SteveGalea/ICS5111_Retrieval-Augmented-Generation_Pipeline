{"summary": "CCHF virus-infected mice died 2\u20136 days post infection with elevated aminotransferase levels and high virus titers in blood and organs. ribavirin, arbidol, and T-705 suppressed virus replication in vitro. in and T-705 is highly potent against CCHF virus in vitro and in vivo. its efficacy exceeds that of the current standard drug for treatment of ribavirin. the virus is endemic in Africa, Asia, southeast Europe, and the Middle East. no mammal with fully functional immune system has been described so far. the first animal model was neonatal mouse [9]. both knockout mice are defective in the innate immune response. a broad-spectrum antiviral showing activity against a range of RNA viruses in vitro and in vivo. the drug is in clinical use primarily for prophylaxis and treatment of acute respiratory infections including influenza. a total of 162 mice were used for this study and all mice were included in the analysis. the virus stock was grown on vero E6 cells, quantified by immunofocus assay. it was stored at 70\u00b0C until use in in vitro and in vivo experiments. the compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at a concentration of about 10 mg/ml and stored at 20\u00b0C. cell growth and viability under compound treatment was determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazoliumbromide (MTT) method. the inhibitory concentrations that reduced the virus titer by 50%, 90%, and 99% (IC50, IC90, and IC99, respectively) were calculated from the sigmoidal functions. ynergy II program evaluates antivirus data according to the Bliss independence model. the ratio between predicted virus titer Vpred(cx,cy) = Vobs(0,0)\u2022(1Exy) and observed virus titer Vobs(cx,cy) was calculated for each drug combination. ten animals per group were infected by intraperitoneal injection with 0.3 to 104 focus forming units (FFU) of CCHFV in 100 or 200 l DMEM containing 2% FCS. mice were monitored daily for signs of disease, and body weight and rectal body temperature were measured. animals with severe signs of disease such as seizures, bleeding, abdominal distention, diarrhea, agony, or weight loss of >15% within 2 days were euthanized. treatment was commenced 1 h p.i. or later and continued until death or day 8. animals received an arbidol dose of 75 or 150 mg/(kgd) or 100 l of 0.5% methylcellulose. infected cell foci were detected with CCHFV nucleoprotein (NP)-specific monoclonal antibody A4. cells were incubated with peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG. serum was inactivated for 1 h at 60\u00b0C. cell conditioning solution 1 or 2 (Ventana) for 30\u201360 min. sections were incubated with primary antibodies directed against B cell marker B220 (1400; eBioscience), apoptosis marker cleaved caspase-3 (1100; R&D Systems), apoptosis marker cleaved caspase-3 (1100; eBioscience), apoptosis marker cleaved caspase-3 (1100; eBio unpaired groups were compared with the two-tailed Mann\u2013Whitney U test for continuous parameters and with two-tailed Fisher's exact test for frequencies. survival curves were compared with the log-rank (Mantel\u2013Cox) test. ethics statement This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations of the German Society for Laboratory Animal Science under supervision of a veterinarian. the compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at a concentration of about 10 mg/ml and stored at 20\u00b0C. final DMSO concentration in the cell culture supernatant was 0.1%. cell growth and viability under compound treatment was determined by immunofocus assay. s x and y were tested in the concentrations c = 0; IC90/8; IC90/4; IC90/4; IC90\u20222; IC90\u20224; IC90\u20228 in all possible combinations (cx,cy) the drug combination data were analyzed using the Bliss independence drug interaction model [44] mouse experiments IFNAR/ mice (129Sv background) [46] were bred in the Specific Pathogen Free animal facility of the Bernhard-Nocht-Institute. six to twelve-week-old female animals (weight median 20 g, range 15\u201324 g) were used for all experiments. a group size of 5 animals was expected to provide sufficiently accurate estimates of survival rate, viremia, and clinical chemistry parameters. animals were euthanized with an isoflurane overdose followed by cervical dislocation. a stock of 10 mg/ml in 0.9% NaCl was prepared before each application. treatment was commenced 1 h p.i. and continued until death or day 8. animals received a T-705 dose of 7.5, 15, 30, or 300 mg/kgd. treatment was commenced 1 h p.i. or later and continued until death or day 8. clinical chemistry Serum samples were diluted 110 or higher, if required, in 0.9% NaCl. parameters were measured for individual animals. sections (4 m) were stained with hematoxylin\u2013eosin (H&E) or processed for immunohistochemistry. anti-rat IgG Histofine Simple Stain MAX PO immuno-enzyme polymer stained with 3,3\u2032-Diaminobenzidine (DAB) substrate. cells were counterstained with hematoxylin using the ultraView Universal DAB Detection Kit (Ventana) 0.3 FFU, 4/5; 1 FFU, 5/5; 3 FFU, 4/5; 10 FFU, 6/8; 1,000 FFU, 8/8; 10,000 FFU, 3/3. animals infected with 100 or 1,000 FFU died between days 3 and 6. animals infected with 10,000 FFU uniformly died at day 2. mice were inoculated with 10, 100, 1,000, or 10,000 FFU of virus. organ titers were determined in animals that succumbed to the infection or had to be euthanized due to the severity of the disease. fected mice showed acute hepatitis with extensive bridging hepatocellular necrosis and a mild to moderate inflammatory response. accumulation of CCHFV NP in hepatocytes and cleaved caspase-3-positive (apoptotic) hepatocytes was detected. proliferation of hepatocytes was also evident. treatment with ribavirin or T-705 was commenced 1 h p.i. and continued until death or day 8. sections were stained with H&E and distribution of CCHFV in the tissue was visualized using a monoclonal antibody against CCHFV NP. CCHFV-infected mice showed moderately decreased numbers of lymphocytes and increased amounts of cell debris in the red and white pulp. spleen showed moderately decreased numbers of lymphocytes and increased amounts of cell debris in the red and white pulp. CCHFV NP was detectable in spleen cells, although the signals were much less intense than in liver. all three compounds showed a potent antiviral effect against CCHFV Afg09-2990 in cell culture. arbidol showed toxicity with a therapeutic index of about 10. blood at day 2 increased the weight at day 2 and 3 (p = 0.03 and p = 0.002). ribavirin-treated mice that succumbed to infection showed extensive bridging hepatocellular necrosis at the time of death. however, untreated or placebo-treated mice showed extensive bridging hepatocellular necrosis. mice were inoculated i.p. with 10, 100, or 1,000 FFU of virus. animals received ribavirin dose of 100/(kgd) or 0.9% NaCl as a placebo. treatment was commenced 1 day before infection and continued until death or day 8. viremia was not determined at day 11. 10 FFU arbidol group: the surviving animal had no AST elevation. viremia was not determined at day 4 due to insufficient amount of blood. both groups were infected with 1,000 FFU CCHFV. animals received a T-705 dose of 300 mg/(kgd) or 0.5% methylcellulose as a placebo. treatment was commenced 1 h, 1 day, or 2 days p.i. and continued until death or day 8. animals received 30, 15, or 7.5 mg/(kgd) T-705 or 0.5% methylcellulose as a placebo. treatment was commenced 1 h p.i. and continued until death or day 8. all animals of 30 and 15 mg/(kgd) treatment groups survived. the log-transformed virus titers in blood represent the mean values. the range of viremia below the detection limit of the immunofocusassay and the normal reference range of AST and ALT in mice are shaded in grey. the animal, which died at day 5, showed no AST/ALT elevation and viremia at day 3. combination of ribavirin and T-705 was inoculated with CCHFV at a MOI of 0.01. compounds were added 18 drug combination matrix was designed as described in Materials and Methods. cell growth and viability under compound treatment was determined by the MTT method. 7.5 mg/(kgd) T-705 and 100 mg/(kgd) ribavirin were co-administered. none of the parameters in the 30 mg/(kgd) T-705 group was statistically significantly different from the parameters of the 30 mg/(kgd) T-705 single-drug group. treatment was commenced 1 h p.i. and continued until death or day 8. the two animals that died at day 6 had no detectable virus in organs or blood. the model was further characterized for the inoculation doses 10, 100, 1,000, and 10,000 FFU. animals infected with 100 or 1,000 FFU died between days 3 and 6. before death, animals lost about 15% of body weight. the data for the 100 and 1,000 FFU groups of nave animals were pooled with corresponding data from placebo controls. the range of viremia below the detection limit of the immunofocusassay and the normal reference range of AST and ALT in mice are shaded in grey. the architecture of Iba-1-positive macrophages (Kupffer cells) in necrotic areas was disturbed. cells showed enlarged cell bodies and focal clustering. alterations suggestive for monocyte/macrophage activation. histopathological findings are representative for 2\u20133 animals that were analyzed per group. scale bar = 50 m. Figure 3. IHC for markers of inflammation, apoptosis, and proliferation in the liver of nave and CCHFV-infected IFNAR/ mice. CCHFV-infected mice showed pathological changes in liver and spleen. main finding was acute hepatitis with extensive necrosis, reactive proliferation of hepatocytes, and morphological signs of monocyte/macrophage activation. CCHFV-infected and apoptotic hepatocytes clustered in the necrotic areas. liver and spleen of nave and CCHFV-infected IFNAR/ mice were inoculated i.p. with 100 FFU of CCHFV. animals were inoculated i.p. with 100 FFU of CCHFV. treatment with ribavirin or T-705 was commenced 1 h p.i. and continued until death or day 8. sections were stained with antibodies against CD3, B220, Ly6G, Iba-1, iNOS, cleaved caspase-3, and Ki67. spleen showed moderately decreased numbers of lymphocytes and increased amounts of cell debris in the red and white pulp. all three compounds were able to suppress virus replication by 3\u20134 log10 units at concentrations of 10 g/ml. IC50 and IC90 values ranged from 0.6\u20132.8 g/ml and 1.2\u20134.7 g/ml respectively. toxicity in the test range as measured by MTT test was only evident for arbidol hydrochloride. antiviral testing in vivo Ribavirin was tested in comparison to a placebo group receiving the vehicle (0.9% NaCl solution) both groups of IFNAR/ mice were infected with 100 FFU CCHFV. ribavirin did not significantly increase the survival rate (p = 0.4) however, the drug prolonged the time to death. necrosis was accompanied by presence of numerous Iba-1-positive macrophages (Kupffer cells) and iNOS-expressing activated monocyte-derived cells. virus antigen was hardly detectable in liver tissue of the treated mice. viremia data obtained from these mice until day 3 were included in the graphs. vertical bars in the graphs for AST and ALT represent the mean values. the range of viremia below the detection limit of the immunofocusassay. all animals of the treatment group survived the infection and showed no signs of disease. Virus was detected neither in blood nor in the organs throughout the observation period. the drug was commenced 1 day or 2 days after virus inoculation. survival was 100% in both groups and animals showed hardly any signs of disease. only if treatment started 2 days p.i., minor changes in weight, temperature, and AST were seen at day 3. animals received a T-705 dose of 30, 15, or 7.5 mg/(kgd) or 0.5% methylcellulose as a placebo. treatment was commenced 1 h p.i. and continued until death or day 8. the virus titer in organs was determined for animals that succumbed to the infection. combinations of ribavirin and T-705 exhibit strong antiviral effects with suppression of virus replication by >5 log units. possible antagonistic or synergistic effects were evaluated using the Bliss independence model for additive effect. ratio between predicted virus titer and observed virus titer was calculated for each drug combination. a ratio >1 indicates synergy (i.e. for the virus titer for predicted additive effect is lower than the experimentally determined virus titer) drug combinations showing a clear difference are marked in yellow with the ratio indicated in red. ribavirin and ribavirin exert synergistic effects according to the Bliss independence model when combined in concentrations around their IC90 in vitro. co-administration of both drugs in the animal model suggests that a combined treatment yields beneficial rather than adverse effects. alteration in mice infected with CCHFV strain Afg09-2990 was acute hepatitis with extensive necrosis, reactive proliferation of hepatocytes, and morphological signs of monocyte/macrophage activation. CCHFV-infected hepatocytes were found in the necrotic areas. cytic choriomeningitis virus was sufficient to infect the animals [49]. the titer in liver is the highest and exceeds 7 log10 FFU/g in some experiments. AST and ALT values reached 10,000 U/l and 1,000 U/l respectively. a direct cytopathic effect of the virus on hepatocytes may be involved in the induction of apoptosis and necrosis. activated Iba-1-positive macrophages and activated monocyte-derived cells expressing iNOS were found in the liver. this may play a crucial role in the strong proinflammatory immune responses following CCHFV infection. arbidol hydrochloride effectively suppressed CCHFV in cell culture. but no beneficial effects in the IFNAR/ mouse model were observed. it is conceivable that its antiviral effect in vitro is at least partially attributable to general cell toxic effects. the IC50 for CCHFV is 5\u201330 times lower than the IC50 values for other bunyaviruses. the drug suppresses virus replication below the level required to elicit antibodies. the mode of action of the drug against CCHFV is not known. both drugs do not act in an antagonistic manner in vitro and in vivo. the experiments in the animal model point to a beneficial rather than adverse interaction in vivo."}
