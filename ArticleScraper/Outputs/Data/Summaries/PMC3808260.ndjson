{"summary": "acute bronchiolitis is a major cause for hospitalisation in young children during the winter season. human Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is the most frequently identified virus. double viral infection is relatively common, occurring in about 10-30% of hospitalised patients. bronchiolitis was defined as acute respiratory disease, accompanied by coryza, cough, inspiratory crackles and/or expiratory wheezing on auscultation. infants with chronic lung disease, congenital heart disease and Down\u2019s syndrome excluded. patients shared a two- or four-bed room, with beds separated at least 1.5 meter. cohorting of patients commenced as soon as the result of RSV-PCR was known. Statistical analysis Chi-square test was used to compare categorical data, Mann-Whitney U-tests for continuous data because of skewed distributions. results Of the 84 patients with bronchiolitis hospitalised during the 11-week study period, 36 were excluded for following reasons. highest dyspnoea score (0-10) 3.0 (2.0 - 4.8) mechanical ventilation 3* (6.2%) Data are presented as median and interquartile range in parentheses. RSV was the major pathogen detected in 83%. 37 (77.1%) shared a room with other bronchiolitis patients. none of the bronchiolitis-patients sharing rooms had been infected with another virus during admission. disease severity tended to be higher in RSV-infected patients compared to RSV-negative patients. 0.285 Mechanical ventilation 1 (9.1%) 2 (5.4%) 0.658 3 (7.5%) 0 (0%) 0.424 Data are presented as median and interquartile range in parentheses, or number and percentage in parentheses as appropriate. separating RSV-infected from RSV-negative patients with bronchiolitis may not be indicated. patients are the most important reason for virological testing in bronchiolitis. this does not exclude the potential usefulness of rapid broad range viral testing in specific circumstances, for example in young febrile infants. rapid broad range viral testing might reduce the need for invasive sepsis workup."}
