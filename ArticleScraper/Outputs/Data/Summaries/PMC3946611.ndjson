{"summary": "hCLE is a 24 kDa protein that shows a nuclear and cytoplasmic localization [1], it associates with the RNAP II and is present in nuclear sites of RNAP II-directed RNA transcription [3] hCLE silencing inhibits cellular mRNA transcription by 50%, which causes down-regulation of an important number of genes. hCLE is a positive modulator of RNAP II transcription that could be involved in transcription initiation and elongation hCLE is distributed in the nucleus and the cytoplasm playing a role in different steps of nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA metabolism. this information would provide further evidence about the role of hCLE and enable the study of whether hCLE shares common interactors in the nucleus and the cytosol. Western blotting was carried out as described earlier. four or 30 g of DNA were transfected per 35 mm or 150 mm culture dishes. cells were processed 24 h after transfection. HEK293T cells were treated with Actinomycin D at 5 g/ml in DMEM-10% FBS during 30 min at 37\u00b0C. after drug treatment the cells were processed for immunofluorescence. plasmids encoding short hairpin RNAs were produced in HEK-293T cells. the pCDNA-hCLE silencing resistant mutant was generated by introducing 3 silent mutations at positions 126, 135 and 141 in the target sequence of hCLE cDNA by using the QuickChangeTM Site-Directed mutagenesis kit. the supernatant was recovered and supplemented with NaCl. the sedimented nuclei were extracted in a solution containing 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.4 M NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT and protease inhibitors. the supernatant was adjusted to final concentration of NaCl 150 mM, Tris-HCl 10 mM pH 8.0 and NP-40 0.1%. GPS Explorer v4.9 was used to search in the non-redundant NCBI protein database. peptides with an individual ion score above the identity threshold were considered correctly identified. peptide samples were analyzed on a nano liquid chromatography system. they were redissolved in 40 l of 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid in water. high-capacity OMIX C18 tips were used. the product ion scan was performed with an accumulation time of 0.250008 s. up to 15 precursor ions were monitored and excluded for 20 s. the total cycle time was 4.05 s. 93T cells were prepared as described above and applied to a Sephacryl S400 resin equilibrated in the corresponding nuclear or cytosol extraction buffers without DTT and glycerol. the void volume was calibrated with dextran blue (MW 2,000,000) that was excluded in the first 6 fractions. the hCLE complexes were analyzed by Western blot. a 50 mW blue diode 405 nm laser at 80% transmission was used for photoactivation in selected regions of interest (2 m diameter) the 488 nm line of the Argon laser was used at very low transmission percentage (4%) for time-lapse imaging of PAGFP. monoclonal antibody 8WG16 (1500) from Covance; for -tubulin, a monoclonal antibody (115000) from SIGMA; for DDX-1, a goat polyclonal antibody sc-49817 (1200) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; for -actin, a rabbit polyclonal antibody (1/200) from Abcam and for S6, a mouse monoclonal antibody 54D2 (1/1000) from Cell Signaling cell supernatants were collected at 40 h posttransfection, filtered through 0.45-m filters, aliquoted, and kept at 80\u00b0C till needed. plasmids encoding short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting the positions 121 to 143 (siCLE.1) and 417\u2013435 (si.CLE.2) in the cDNA of hCLE were generated by insertion of adaptor primers pair (5\u2032CCGGTAAGATT the pCDNA-hCLE silencing resistant mutant was generated by introducing 3 silent mutations at positions 126, 135 and 141 in the target sequence of hCLE cDNA by using the QuickChangeTM Site-Directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) hCLE-TAP protein was purified from nuclear or cytosolic cell extracts. the supernatant was recovered and supplemented with NaCl. the supernatant (nuclear extracts) was adjusted to final concentration of NaCl 150 mM, Tris-HCl 10 mM pH 8.0 and NP-40 0.1%. nuclear or cytosolic extracts were then used for TAP purification as previously described. the confidence interval for protein identification was set to 95% (p0.05) only peptides with an individual ion score above the identity threshold were considered correctly identified. samples were diluted up to 200 l with 50 mM TEAB/50% TFE. the analytical column was a silica-based reversed phase column Chrom XP C18 75 m15 cm, 3 m particle size and 120 pore size. the loading pump delivered a solution of 0.1% formic acid in water at 2 l/min. the nano pump provided a flow-rate of 300 nl/min. raw data were translated to mascot general file (mgf) format. the database contains 36962 proteins and their reversed sequences. accuracy below 10 ppm was found both for MS and MS/MS spectra. each PMF spectrum was internally calibrated with the mass signals of trypsin autolysis ions to reach a typical mass measurement accuracy of 25 ppm. Known trypsin and keratin mass signals, as well as potential sodium and potassium adducts (+21 Da and +39 Da) were removed from the peak list. the protein extracts were dissolved in 20 l of 50 mM TEAB/50% TFE. samples were digested with trypsin at an enzyme-to protein ratio of 201, at 37\u00b0C overnight. samples were dried and redissolved in 40 l of 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid. isocratic conditions of 98% A: 2% B for 1 minute, a linear increase to 30% B in 54 minutes, a linear increase to 40% B in 10 minutes, isocratic conditions of 90% B for 10 minutes and return to initial conditions in 8 min. mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent acquisition mode. below 10 ppm was found both for MS and MS/MS spectra. a sublist containing less than 1% of peptides matching the reversed sequences was extracted and used for further analysis. live cell imaging HEK293T cells were transfected with the phCLE-PAGFP plasmid. radioactivity was detected in a phosphorimager 24 hours post-transfection. a 50 mW blue diode 405 nm laser at 80% transmission was used in time-lapse mode. the smallest anti-hCLE reactive band has a 48 kDa molecular weight. the smallest anti-hCLE reactive band could correspond to hCLE dimer. the smallest anti-hCLE reactive band has a 48 kDa molecular weight. hCLE-cBD protein was dialyzed and analyzed in non-denaturing gels. a band of around 48 kDa that correspond to the hCLE-CBD protein was observed. hCLE-hCLE dimers are resistant to denaturing conditions. hCLE-hCLE forms dimers that are resistant to denaturing conditions. the hCLE-CBD purified protein was dialyzed and analyzed in non-denaturing gels followed by Western blot detection. the lines denote hCLE identification by MS-MS technique. hCLE was isolated from cytoplasmic RNA-containing granules in neurons [8], [9]. to gain information about the possible functions of hCLE in the nucleus and the cytosol we characterized its associated proteins. peptides with a FDR 1% were considered statistically significant. only proteins with at least 2 non-redundant peptides were presented in Table 2. the highest Mascot score corresponded to hCLE protein both in nuclear and cytosolic fractions. 293T cells were transfected with the hCLE-TAP or the TAP (Control) expressing plasmids and nuclear and cytosolic extracts were used for affinity purification. a sample of the nuclear and cytosolic extracts were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot in order to confirm the presence of hCLE-TAP protein. nucleo-cytoplasmic transport and cytoskeleton-related factors *Myosin light chain kinase 2, skeletal/cardiac muscle Q9H1R3 65104 5(2) 193 1(1) 61 Myosin light polypeptide 6 P60660 17057 2(2) 63 \u2013 \u2013 Ran GTPase-activating protein 1 P46060 63870 2(2) 61 \u2013 \u2013 Liprin-alpha-1 Q13136 13615 2 tRNA-splicing ligase (HSPC 117) Q9Y3I0 55589 64(35) 3072 8 (7) 234 *Protein FAM98B Q52LJ0 37489 34(18) 1570 3(3) 167 Putative RNA binding protein Luc7-like 1 Q9NQ29 44023 2(2) 123 \u2013 \u2013 Transport and cytoskeleton related factors *Myosin light chain kinase 2, table includes proteins where at least 2 non-redundant peptides were identified. a FDR 1% at peptide level are present exclusively in hCLE purified fractions. their molecular weight, the number of confidently identified peptides and the number of non-redundant ones, as well as the protein Mascot scores. processing factor 19 Q9UMS4 55514 1(1) 71 Small nuc. ribonucleoprotein-associated proteins B and B P14678 24732 1(1) 55 Pre-mRNA-processing-splicing factor 8 Q6P2Q9 274484 1(1) 49 RNA-binding protein 25 P49756 100400 1(1) 46 U4/U6 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein Prp4 O43172 58964 1(1) 45 Splicing factor 3 ribosomal protein L10-like Q96L21 24871 1(1) 43 60S acidic ribosomal protein P2 P05387 11658 1(1) 43 40S ribosomal protein S30 P62861 6644 1(1) 42 Others E3 SUMO-protein ligase PIAS1 O75925 72572 1(1) 99 Lysozyme C P61626 16894 1(1) 81 L-lactate dehydrogenas binding cassette sub-family F member 2 Q9UG63 71704 1(1) 52 Fragile X mental retardation-interacting protein 2 Q7Z417 76121 1(1) 45 Tight junction protein ZO-2 Q9UDY2 134060 1(1) 44 Microfibrillar-associated protein 1 P55081 51927 1(1) 42 Emerin P50402 29022 1(1) 37 Pericentrin O95613 380059 1(1) 35 Proliferation Disintegrin hek293T cells were transfected with control pC-TAP or pChCLE-TAP plasmids. the RNA associated to CBD or hCLE-CBD after DNAse treatment was isolated from purified complexes, radiolabeled and analyzed in denaturing acrylamide-urea 15% gels. hCLE is present in protein complexes of 220\u2013480 kDa or smaller together with DDX1, HSPC117 and FAM98B. treatment with RNAse produced a decrease in the size of the hCLE complexes. hCLE monomers and dimers fractioned equally in untreated or RNAse treated extracts. hCLE is not resistant to denaturing conditions and therefore migrates as a monomer. monomer of hCLE, DDX1, HSPC117 and FAM98A is present in larger complexes and absent in smaller ones containing hCLE dimers. RNA is present in hCLE cytosolic complexes, but the association of cytosolic hCLE to other characterized proteins is RNAse resistant. hCLE has been detected in the dendritic RNA granules that transport specific mRNAs. hCLE is in complexes of 220\u2013480 kDa while hCLE is in complexes of around 220\u2013480 kDa. hCLE is mainly in complexes of around 220\u2013480 kDa. hCLE-TAP (**) and endogenous HSPC117 were clearly detected in the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of the cell extracts. DDX1 and FAM98B were only detected in the cytoplasmic fraction and at much lesser extent than HSPC117. RNAse treatment of the cytosolic fraction did not change this association. depletion of hCLE caused down-regulation of hCLE-interacting proteins without altering -actin content. hCLE silencing down-regulates the nuclear and cytoplasmic expression of HSPC117, DDX1 and DDX1 and its overexpression recovers the levels of these proteins. hCLE modulates the expression of hCLE-interacting proteins. HEK293T cells were infected with lentiviruses expressing a control sequence (Ct) or specific sequences for hCLE silencing (siCLE.1 and si-CLE.2) 5 days post-infection, the cells were left untransfected (-) or transfected (+) with a plasmid expressing a hCLE gene with 3 silent mutations that avoid hCLE is a novel shuttling protein, with different kinetics for its nucleo-cytoplasmic movement. hek293T cells were transfected with the phCLE-PAGFP plasmid. hCLE enters the nucleus slower than it leaves it, while entering the nucleus after photoactivation takes 9 s and 540 ms. photoactivation was applied in the nucleus to visualize hCLE import. the numbers below represent minutes, seconds and milliseconds after photoactivation. hCLE import is dependent on active transcription. cultured HEK293T cells were incubated in the absence of Actinomycin D (Act. D) during 1 h, washed, fixed and processed for immunofluorescence using antibodies anti-hCLE and DAPI. the import of hCLE-associated proteins is also dependent on active transcription. to confirm these results we performed nuclear and cytosolic separation of untreated or Actinomycin D treated cells at 5 g/ml during 1 h. we analyzed the presence of hCLE, DDX1, HSPC117 and FAM98B in both types of fractions. nuclear and cytoslic extracts were prepared and used for Western blot assays. RNAP II and -actin were used as markers for subcellular fractionation. previous experiments using cellular extracts to detect hCLE by Western blotting showed an anomalous migration of hCLE in SDS-denaturing gels according to its predicted molecular weight of 24 kDa. the construct expresses a carboxy-terminal hCLE-TAP (tandem-affinity purification) tagged protein (pChCLE-TAP) and was generated by cloning the cDNA for hCLE upstream of the TAP tag sequence in the pC-TAP plasmid [14]. this allows purification by successive IgG-Sepharose and Calmodulin-Agarose affinity chromatography steps. hCLE-hCLE is capable to form dimers resistant to denaturing conditions. hCLE-hCLE is present in complexes where the minimal size correspond to hCLE-hCLE dimers. some of these dimers have a compact structure that is resistant to denaturing conditions. hCLE/c14orf166 gi|55613379 28066 6 14 (1) 150 45.4 27 kDa band hCLE/c14orf166 gi|55613379 28066 6 14 (1) 150 45.4 27 kDa band

present in both compartments. hCLE protein was clearly visible and in addition, other protein bands were detected. the presence of proteins involved in nucleo-cytoplasmic transport and motor-related proteins was also observed. some proteins were associated to hCLE both, in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. nucleo-cytoplasmic transport and cytoskeleton-related factors *Myosin light chain kinase 2,

non-redundant peptides were identified. their molecular weight, the number of confidently identified peptides and the number of non-redundant ones, as well as the protein Mascot scores, is shown. hCLE is a component of large complexes, which should have associated RNAs. nuclear and cytoplasmic purified hCLE-interacting proteins are present in complexes with the endogenous hCLE. the proteomic data indicated that purified hCLE is a component of protein complexes and that the same complexes are found in both, the nucleus and the cytoplasm. to test the presence of those purified hCLE-interacting proteins, we prepared nuclear and cytosolic extracts of HEK293T cells and analyzed them by S hCLE monomers and dimers fractioned equally in untreated or RNAse treated extracts. hCLE appears to associate to those proteins bound to the purified protein. the association is at least in part RNA mediated. proteomic data indicated the existence of ribosomal proteins of the 40 and 60S subunits associated with purified hCLE as well as cytoskeleton-related proteins. the nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of S6 protein has been extensively characterized. a portion of the protein fractionates with hCLE and DDX1, HSPC117 and FAM98B. hCLE is mainly in complexes of 220\u2013480 kDa while hCLE is mainly in complexes of around 220\u2013480 kDa. results indicate that S6 may associate with hCLE-DDX1-HSPC117-FAM98B complexes in an RNA-dependent manner. we examined the effect of RNAse treatment in these associations. purified hCLE behaves similarly to endogenous hCLE. the nucleus association of hCLE to HSPC117 is, at least in part, RNA mediated. cytosolic interactions seem to be mediated by protein-protein interactions. cells were infected with lentiviruses expressing a control siRNA or siRNA. total cell extracts from the infected cells were used against hCLE, DDX1, HSPC117, FAM98B and -actin as control. depletion of hCLE caused down-regulation of the hCLE-interacting proteins without altering -actin content. HEK293T cells were infected with lentiviruses expressing a control sequence (Ct) or specific sequences for hCLE silencing (siCLE.1) 5 days post-infection, the cells were left untransfected (-) or transfected (+) with a plasmid expressing a hCLE gene with 3 silent mutations that avoids its silencing (ns.hCLE). 48h post-transfection, nuclear and hCLE enters the nucleus slower than it leaves it. entering the nucleus after cytoplasmic photoactivation takes 9 s and 540 ms. hCLE is a novel shuttling protein, with different kinetics for its nucleo-cytoplasmic movement. hCLE seems to be closely related with nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA metabolism. hek293T cells were treated with Actinomycin D, a general transcription inhibitor and the localization of hCLE was examined by immunofluorescence. hCLE nuclear import is transcription dependent. hCLE is closely associated to DDX1, HSPC117 and FAM98B. hCLE is also dependent on active transcription. treatment with Actinomycin D produces a clear retention of these two proteins in the cytoplasm in parallel with hCLE behavior, reinforcing the functional association of the complexes. treatment with imomycin D produces a decrease of these proteins in the nuclear compartment together with an increase in the cytosolic fraction. these results suggest that active transcription is required to permit nuclear localization of hCLE, probably in protein complexes with DDX1-HSPC117-FAM98B. high-throughput approaches have revealed that 70% of mRNA species are asymmetrically distributed [33] and a very large number of proteins participate in the process. the molecular mechanisms responsible for the coupling of post-transcriptional regulatory networks are yet poorly understood. hCLE takes part in RNPs Involved in RNA Metabolism One of the factors that may play a role in the life of RNA is hCLE. hCLE also interacts with nup153, which is essential for the nucleocytoplasmic pore localization of Nup50. cytoskeletal-related proteins and translation-related proteins are also found associated to hCLE both in the nucleus and the cytosol. hCLE-PAGFP fusion protein has allowed us to carry out live cell fluorescence microscopy that shows that hCLE is a shuttling protein. some shuttling proteins accumulate in the cytoplasm when RNA polymerase II transcription is inhibited. some are RNA binding proteins that depend on their RNA binding domains for shuttling and belong to protein families like the SR. hCLE has been described as an RNA-binding protein no recognized RNA binding motifs have been found in its sequence. the reason why these proteins require on going transcription for their nuclear import has not been examined. the reason why these proteins require on going transcription for their nuclear import is not examined. nuclear accumulation of DDX1, HSPC117 and FAM98B is modulated by hCLE. hCLE-DDX1-HSPC117-FAM98B complex would enter the nucleus in conditions of active transcription then it would associate to newly synthesized RNAs mediating their nucleo-cytoplasmic transport. hCLE is a core component of different cytosolic RNA transporting granules. hCLE should be associated with nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins involved in nuclear events such as transcription, processing and transport and cytosolic events as translation. hCLE also interacts with nup153, which is essential for the nuclear pore localization of Nup50 and whose interactions with soluble transport factors underlie the efficiency of certain nucleocytoplasmic transport pathways. nuclear and cytosolic hCLE-interacting proteins are DDX1, HSPC117 and FAM98. DDX1 is an RNA-helicase that binds homopolymeric poly(A) RNA [40] and modulates HIV-1 replication. hCLE is a shuttling protein whose Import Depends on Active Transcription. hCLE has been described as an RNA-binding protein no recognized RNA binding motifs have been found in its sequence. other example of protein whose nuclear import is prevented by RNA polymerase II inhibitors is the testis-abundant RNA-binding protein. the four proteins fractionate in protein complexes of similar size in the nucleus and the cytoplasm, together with the S6 ribosomal protein, being the size of the corresponding complexes. hCLE-DDX1-HSPC117 and FAM98B expression is modulated by hCLE since its silencing provokes their nuclear and cytosolic down-regulation. the video was analyzed with Leica Microsystems LAS AF software (version 2.3.0). Photoactivation was applied in the nucleus to visualize hCLE export."}
