{"summary": "disulfide bonds in the 2 integrins and IIb3 integrin maintain their low affinity state. thrombus formation is controlled by the redox state of disulfide bonds in the beta chain of IIb3 [8,9] disulfide bonds in the 2 integrins and IIb3 integrin maintain their low affinity state. leucocyte membrane proteins with labile disulfide bonds were labelled with maleimide-PEO2-biotin (MPB) after reduction, the proteins with labile disulfide bonds were labelled with maleimide-PEO2-biotin (MPB) this enabled these proteins to be purified by avidin affinity chromatography. identification of a labile disulfide in CD132 The CD132 chain was identified as containing a redox-labile disulfide bond (Cys183\u2013Cys232) in screens of T cells treated with the chemical reductant TCEP and three enzymatic reductants (TRX, GILT and PDI) the peptides identified by mass spectrometry are summarized in table 1. the peptide was undetectable under the conditions employed in the study. the peptide was detected with both MPB and carbamidomethyl modifications. this indicates that modification of both Cys residues was not 100 per cent efficient. thioredoxin 31.4 FSLPSVDELKR GLTESLQPDYSER LNLQNLVIPR NLEDLVTEYQGNFSAWSGVSK SWTELIVNHEPR CLQYLVQYR MPB@1 183 CLQYLVQYR carbamidomethyl@1 183 EITSGCQIQK carbamidomethyl@6 115 LPS 6.8 SWTELIVNHEPR GLTESLQPDYSER Figure 1 in-maleimide modification forms a labile disulfide bond with the Cys232 shown in red. other residues in the structure are shown in yellow. the structure of the CD132 ectodomain has been determined in complexes of both the human IL-2 and IL-4 receptors with IL-2 and IL-4. the most common configuration of the known allosteric disulfide bonds is the \u2013RHStaple. in both of these structures, the Cys160\u2013Cys209 disulfide bond sits at the interface of CD132, linking two beta loops in direct contact with IL-2 (red cartoon and surface) the growth of such a line would be inhibited by mild reducing conditions by affecting the ability of CD132 to signal in response to IL-2. this line was treated with TCEP and its effects on proliferation were determined by incorporation of 3H-thymidine. washing the TCEP from the cells gave recovery of proliferation to approximately 80 per cent of control levels indicating that inhibition was reversible on a timescale of hours. reducing enzyme thioredoxin (TRX) causes inhibition of proliferation of HT-2 cells. treatment of purified IL-2 with 2.5 mM TCEP gives no significant difference in its ability to permit proliferation of HT-2 cells. rat IL-2 was incubated under the same reducing conditions known to give extensive inhibition of HT-2 cell proliferation. the IL-2 protein was denatured with urea, fully reduced with TCEP and alkylated with iodoacetamide (IAA) peptides were analysed for differential labelling with the two thiol-reactive agents. IL-4 contains two further disulfide bonds (figure 4b,c) IL-2 contains a conserved 'free' cysteine buried inside of the 4-helix bundle. the Cys59\u2013Cys105 disulfide bond in IL-2 is buried. the Cys3\u2013Cys127 disulfide bond in IL-4 is highly solvent exposed. the structures of IL-2 and IL-4 are similar, but one disulfide bond in IL-4 is massively exposed to solvent. the structures of IL-2 (red) and IL-4 (green) are similar, but one disulfide bond in IL-4 is massively exposed to solvent. IL-2-dependent HT-2 cells were starved of IL-2 for 18 h to give a background level of STAT-5 tyrosine phosphorylation. the cells were reduced using identical conditions to those used to identify the labile disulfide. a third sample of cells was treated with IL-2 without prior reduction. IL-2, TCEP and MPM (to block free Cys residues) were probed with anti-phospho STAT-5 antibody. levels of phospho-STAT-5 were determined by densitometry and ratio to total STAT-5 calculated. one Cys residue in CD132 was identified as an MPB-labelled peptide with the sequence C*LQYLVQYR (table 1; the asterisk indicates the modified Cys residue) the MS/MS spectrum for this peptide obtained after PDI reduction is shown in figure 1a. a peptide containing Cys232, the other residue that makes up this disulfide bond, was not detected with an MPB label. CD132 reduction data from TCEP, PDI, TRX and GILT reductase from global screens of a 2B4 T cell clone. data show the percentage coverage of CD132, the CD132 peptides identified and any modifications indicated with their positions within the identifed peptide. the peptide containing the biotin-maleimide modification (green; Cys 183 in blue) forms a labile disulfide bond with the Cys232 shown in red. a disulfide bond with Cys209 in these structures for human CD132 (figure 2). this domain type has a fold similar to an Ig-like domain consisting of two beta sheets. however, in some cases disulfide bonds are present, such as the Cys160\u2013Cys209 disulfide of CD132. ide bond enough to affect the ability of IL-2 to bind and signal through the receptor was investigated. CD132 is shown in mauve, the cytokine (IL-2 and IL-4) in brown, the beta chain of the receptor in blue. the IL-2 receptor complex has an additional chain, CD25, shown in green. washing the TCEP from the cells gave recovery of proliferation to approximately 80 per cent of control levels. same reducing conditions had no effect on proliferation of the 2B4 hybridoma T cell line that is not dependent on exogenous IL-2 for proliferation. ulfide bonds to free sulfydryls and is known to be produced by dendritic cells. TRX gave similar inhibition of the HT-2 cells as TCEP. recombinant rat IL-2 was incubated under the same conditions. itative analysis based on the total ion counts of the peptides' precursor scan peaks. less than 1 per cent contained the NEM-modified Cys compared with the IAA-modified Cys. for the HLQCLENELGALQR peptide about 28 per cent was in the NEM-modified form (table 2). each peptide was observed multiple times owing to deaminidation. the figures given are for the sum of the ion intensities for each set of peptides. there are no structures for rat or mouse IL-2. recombinant rat IL-2 was just as effective as normal IL-2 in controlling the proliferation of the HT-2 IL-2-dependent cell line. reduction of CD132 inhibits signalling through the Jak-3\u2013STAT-5 pathway Cytokine receptors using CD132 signal through Jak\u2013STAT pathways. cells were starved of IL-2 for 18 h to give a background level of STAT-5 tyrosine phosphorylation. cells were reduced using identical conditions to those used to identify the labile disulfide. cells treated with IL-2 alone resulted in an increased level of tyrosine phosphorylation in STAT-5. lysates from non-reduced and reduced HT-2 cells were Western blotted with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (figure 5c) this showed there was no significant decrease in global phosphorylation upon reduction, and inhibition of phosphorylation of tyrosines in STAT-5 and cell proliferation is pathway-specific through CD132. reduction of this disulfide may impart added flexibility into loops affecting IL-2 and IL-4 binding signalling. mutations in several residues at the CD132\u2013cytokine interface lead to X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome (X-SCID) reduction of the receptor is reversible over a period of hours. this could be due to reduced disulfide bonds reforming after reducing conditions have been removed. the cells could be turning over the receptor at the cell surface and replacing reduced CD132 with newly synthesized non-reduced. 2B4 cells were treated with 2.5 mM Methyl-PEO12-maleimide (MPM) to block any free Cys residues, washed and then incubated with the various reducing agents for 30 min at room temperature. the cells were lysed in 1 per cent Triton X-100 with 5 mM N-ethylmaleimide and membrane glycoproteins purified by lentil lectin affinity chromatography. the spleen cells were teased out into RPMI containing 2.5 mM MBP. the cells were gently agitated at 4\u00b0C for 30 min. the data were submitted to the in-house Central Proteomics Facilities Pipeline. a total of 1.5 104 cells per well were incubated for 18 h with 3H-thymidine in RPMI containing 10 per cent FCS and 2 per cent recombinant rat IL-2 supernatant. labile disulfide bonds formed were alkylated with 2.5 mM NEM in PBS for 30 min. a total of 5 105 cells were either reduced (2.5 mM TCEP for 30 min) or reduced and alkylated (2.5 mM TCEP + 2.5 mM MPM for 30 min) and then treated with IL-2 (recombinant rat supernatant) for 30 min. the modified proteins were repurified using monomeric avidin beads. the eluent was digested with PNGase F and trypsin. the peptide samples were desalted on a C18 packed pipette tip system. ral index quantitation was applied to the grouped meta-searches to give protein-level quantitation between reduced samples and controls. all lists of peptide and protein identifications were generated with a probability cut-off corresponding to a 1% false discovery rate (FDR) relative to a target decoy database. IL-2 was denatured (8 M urea, 1 h), reduced (10 mM DTT, 37\u00b0C, 30 min) and alkylated (10 mM IAA, 1 h) the IL-2 was thoroughly washed with 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate and then subjected to trypsin digest and mass spectrometry. edward et al."}
