{"summary": "middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first isolated in 2012 from a patient with severe acute respiratory disease complicated by renal failure. 80% of human cases have been reported in Saudi Arabia with 211 cases occurring in the first 9 months of 2017. beginning in may 2015, a large hospital-associated outbreak of MERS occurred in the Republic of Korea. professional APCs link innate and adaptive immunity. they act as a first defense against viral infection by stimulating immune surveillance, priming, and tolerance. no prophylactic or therapeutic options are proven as effective interventions. ene citrate (TOMF), chlorpromazine (CPZ) and chloroquine (CQ) were effective in blocking MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infection in vitro in established cell lines such as vero E6 and Huh 7 cells [13, 14]. to address pharmaceutical efficacy against MERS-CoV infection in primary cells critical for blocking infection, we tested several candidate MERS-antivirals in human MDMs. toremifene citrate (CAS 89778-27-8) was purchased from millipore Sigma, St. Louis, MO. toremifene citrate (CAS 89778-27-8) was used as a solvent for the high-throughput screening assay described below. the cells were supplied with 20 ng/ml of human granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and 10 ng/ml of interleukin (IL)-4. the cells were then incubated for 6 days at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 with a change of medium every second day. analysis of the MDM and DC phenotype was completed by flow cytometry on a BD Fortessa LSR II cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) results were analyzed using Flowjo software (FLOWJO, Ashland, OR) cells were gated around the live, singlet monocyte population. MERS-CoV growth kinetics on MDMs and MDDCs were seeded at 5 105 cells per well in 48-well plates and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. cells were infected at a MOI of 2 for 1 (hour) h at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 after the inoculum was removed. the cells were fixed and stained with neutral buffered formalin (NBF) the plates were then washed with running water and air-dried. the plaques were then enumerated, and the virus titer was calculated. concentrations of all the analytes in the quality control reagents were found to be within the expected ranges. the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was determined using the lowest point on the standard fit curve that was at least 3 times above background. cell culture supernatants were clarified by centrifugation and stored at -80\u00b0C for future use. the fixed plates were stained with a rabbit polyclonal antibody to the MERS-CoV-EMC/2012 S protein at 1:1000 followed by staining with Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L) antibody. utions were used to infect vero E6 cells on 96-well plates with seven infected wells for each dilution. samples containing only cell culture media were used as a negative control. tests were added to each well at a volume of 100 l. all staff performing this work were trained to work in the biocontainment space. cells, compounds, and virus Vero E6 cells (ATCC 1568) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium with 10% heat inactive fetal bovine serum (FBS) MERS-CoV stock titer was determined by plaque assay on vero E6 cells. primary cell generation and immunophenotyping by flow cytometry. CD14+ monocytes were isolated from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells for differentiation into MDMs and MDDCs. the panel contained anti-human monoclonal antibodies specific for CD14 (fluorescein), HLA-DR (V500), CD11b (PB), CD163 (APC), CD169 (PE), CD86 (PE-CY7) (BD Biosciences) MDMs and MDDCs were seeded at 5 105 cells per well in 48-well plates and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. cell-free supernatants were collected, aliquoted to multiple microtubes at the indicated time-points, and frozen at -80\u00b0C until used. test samples were diluted serially 1:10, and 100 l of the sample was added to each well of 6-well plates containing an 80\u201390% confluent monolayer of Vero E6 cells. plates were then incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 without being disturbed. protein (MIP)-1, interferon-inducible protein (IP)-10, and regulated upon activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) the assays were performed according to the manufacturers' instructions in 96-well Mylar plates (Millipore) as described previously [15]. in powder formulations were dissolved in (DMSO) (Millipore Sigma) final DMSO concentrations were lower than 0.05%. drug solutions diluted in RPMI-1640 with 10% FBS (R-10 medium) to a 4X concentration were added into a 96-well, cell-free, drug dilution plate. cell plates for each cell type were infected with MERS-CoV. a 10-fold serial dilution, 101 to 107, was made from cell-free supernatant samples collected from drug efficacy evaluation studies. samples containing only cell culture media were used as a negative control. the plates were incubated for 6 days at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. SI is defined as the ratio of the concentration of 50% cellular cytotoxicity to 50% effective concentration (SI = = CC50EC50) Error bars represent the standard deviation of three replicates unless indicated otherwise. a 2- to 4-log10 increase in viral titers was observed in mature MDDCs. no significant increase in viral titer was observed in mature MDDCs up to 8 days pi. no virus could be detected by 6 to 8 days pi. in MDMs, MERS-CoV infection resulted in increased concentrations of almost all antiviral or proinflammatory cytokines and most chemokines. many of these cytokines or chemokines were released as soon as 1 h pi. the high induction of IFN-, and IP-10 over the course of the infection was dramatic. all data points represent triplicate biological replicates from four donors. effects of chloroquine and chlorpromazine on MERS-CoV replication in MDMs and immature MDDCs. chlorpromazine (CPZ) was detected in infected cells using an immunofluorescence assay. the antigen was detected with a rabbit polyclonal antibody to S protein. percent inhibition of MERS-CoV infection is shown in blue. a 1\u20131.5 log10 virus reduction was measured in TOMF-treated cells. but only when the dose is higher than 20 M, with a corresponding increase in cytotoxicity. CPZ was active against MERS-CoV infection with a 3.1 log10 drop. results are representative of 2 individual experiments with 3 replicates in each. differentiated MDMs and MDDCs were carefully characterized by flow cytometry as performed previously. titers from supernatants of MERS-CoV-infected macrophages and dendritic cells were infected at an MOI = 2 with MERS-CoV Jordan variant. the release of cytokines and chemokines was measured from virus-infected cells. MERS-CoV infection repressed IL-6 expression from MDM. increased MIP-1 and IP-10 expression was observed in immature MDDCs. donor-to-donor variation in the cytokine response was observed. antiviral activity of CPZ (EC50 = 13.58 M) did not separate well from cytotoxicity. effect of pretreatment of monocyte-derived macrophages with toremifene (TOMF), (B) chloroquine (CQ) and (C) chlorpromazine (CPZ) on subsequent infection. percent inhibition of MERS-CoV infection is shown in blue. percent cytotoxicity of compounds without virus is shown in orange. results are representative of 2 individual experiments with 3 replicates. 3.1 log10 drop at the drug dosage of 15 M, but TOMF and CQ were not active. TCID50 was determined using the Reed-Muench method. the lack of treatment is due to the poorly understood pathogenesis of MERS and other coronavirus infections. human APC cells, MDMs and immature MDDCs, play important roles in bridging innate and adaptive immunity during viral infections. in their role in the immune response, APCs are also a potential initial site for viral replication. in this study, we assessed the characteristics of MERS-CoV growth kinetics in human MDMs and immature MDDCs. abortive herpes herpesvirus (herpes simplex virus-1) infection of mature MDDC is able to modulate their inhibition of T-cell stimulatory function. proinflammatory cytokines is essential for host resistance against MERS-CoV infection. expression of IL-6 and TNF- are a potential indicators of severe respiratory viral infection. restriction of virus growth in mature MDDCs results in no antiviral activation by IFN-2. however, only moderate expression of IP-10 and minimal induction of MIP-1, MCP-1, and RANTES were observed in mature or immature MDDCs. MERS-CoV replicates poorly in human macrophages and monocyte-derived dendritic cells, but stimulates an immune response. however, Zhou, et al. found MERS-CoV can infect and robustly replicate in MDMs and immature MDDCs triggering the aberrant production of proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine responses. toMF is an estrogen receptor modulator that has been shown to inhibit filoviruses [38] and block both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV with EC50s12.9 and 11.97M. this drug inhibits late phrase of virus entry by interfering the fusion of filoviruses. in primary cells, the EC50 increased to 38 M though lower cytotoxicity was seen. previous work has reported that CPZ inhibits MERS-CoV infection of Huh 7 cells with an EC50 of 4.9, vs CC50 of 21.3 M. however, the high cytotoxicity (25.64 M) observed with CPZ on both types of primary cells preclude further development."}
