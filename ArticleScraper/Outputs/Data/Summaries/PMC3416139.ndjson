{"summary": "human HEV is classified into four genotypes (41) following food-borne and waterborne fecal-oral infection, clinical symptoms range from asymptomatic to severe hepatitis (57). in industrialized countries, hepatitis B virus and HEV constitute the most common causes of acute hepatitis in developing countries (57). zoonotic infection seems to contribute to a high seroprevalence in swine handlers and veterinarians (7, 22, 42, 44) more divergent animal hepeviruses have been described recently. a distinct hepevirus lineage associated with mild hepatitis in infected animals was detected in wild Norway rats (31, 38, 60) bats have been linked to a growing number of emerging viruses, including lyssaviruses, coronaviruses, henipaviruses, and filoviruses (8). for all of these viruses, bats carry larger viral diversities than other mammals, supporting the notion that bats might act as viral reservoirs. we investigated a globally representative biological sample from 85 different bat species, including over 3,000 specimens. bat families for which samples were tested in this study are shown in boldface type. names of bat species which tested positive for hepeviruses are shown in red type next to their family designations. the screening RT-PCR amplicons were TA cloned (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany), reamplified with vector-specific primers. further broadly reactive nested RT-PCR assays were designed for additional genomic regions to enable a full-genome characterization. additional primers used for full-genome characterization are available upon request.

PCR products were extended up to the size of the first-round fragment for phylogenetic analyses using heminested RT-PCR oligonucleotides and an additional bat hepevirus-specific reverse primer. amplicons from generic PCR assays were bridged by long-range PCR using gene-specific primers and the Expand high-fidelity (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and Phusion PCR (new England BioLabs, Frankfurt, Germany) kits. RNA quantification was done by using photometrically quantified in vitro RNA transcripts as described above and specific real-time RT-PCR assays. quantification was done by using 5 l of RNA extract, 300 nM each primer, and 180 nM probe, using the SSIII one-step kit. nucleotide sequences from human hepeviruses determined in this study are available under GenBank accesssion numbers JQ034512 to JQ071861. bat fecal and blood specimens were collected in Germany, Bulgaria, Spain, Ghana, Gabon, Papua New Guinea, Australia, Costa Rica, and Panama throughout 2002 to 2011. the anonymized samples were extracted in pools of 10 to 40 by using the viral RNA minikit (Qiagen) 96-member pools containing 100 l of individual plasma donations were concentrated by ultracentrifugation, followed by RNA purification and elution in 65 l. the total number of analyzed individual donors was 93,146. ence (5\u2032\u20133\u2032)b Polarity Use Hepeviridae HEV-F4228 ACYTTYTGTGCYYTITTTGGTCCITGGTT + Heminested screening RT-PCR HEV-R4598 CCGGGTTCRCCIGAGTGTTTCTTCCA HEV-BS7like-R4602 ACGACCATRTTCCAIACIGT 5\u2032 completion of 1st-round screening amplicons. 48 CCIATGCCITAYGTICCITACCC + HEV-R1045 GTCAKIAGICKIGARCARCARARIGC HEV-R1065 ATVCCICGIAGRTAIGTCATDAG HEV-R1075 GTIACYTTGTAYSWRATICCICGIAGRTAIGTCA HEV-F5760 CTGACGTTTTCGACCTGTCGT + Heminested RT-PCR 3 for full-genome sequencing HEV-F5770 GCGTCTGT a named after the position in the reference sequence under GenBank accession number NC_001434. b R is G/A, Y is C/T, S. abae bat hepevirus HEV-G19E-rtF CCTGGTTTTCTATGGTGATCT + HEV-G19E-rtP FAM-AATCAGACCTGCATGCTCACACTATGGCT-BHQ1 + (probe) HEV-Pan-rtP first-round RT-PCRs were carried out by using a protocol with reverse transcription at 50\u00b0C for 20 min and subsequent PCR at 95\u00b0C for 3 min, 10 cycles with 95\u00b0C for 15 s, a 1\u00b0C touchdown decrease of the annealing temperature down to 50\u00b0C. second-round reactions used the same cycling protocol but without the RT step. amplicons from generic PCR assays were bridged by long-range PCR using gene-specific primers and the Expand high-fidelity (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and Phusion PCR (new England BioLabs, Frankfurt, Germany) kits. also, Phi29-driven whole-transcriptome amplification (WTA) was done for the enrichment of viral sequences against the DNA/RNA background in specimens. human positive-control serum was used in dilutions of 1:40 and 1:80. cyanine 2-labeled goat anti-human serum was applied as a secondary antibody. nuclei were counterstained with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) detected sequences originated from five bat species of three different families. detection rate in feces was not significantly higher than those in blood (1 of 1,173) and liver (1 of 72) very high virus RNA concentrations were found in all fecal samples.

ORF2 was most conserved in the shell (S) domain, including tyrosine at position 288, which was previously described to be crucial for capsid formation in HEV genotype 3 (71). the middle (M) and protruding (P) domains were less conserved. a putative ORF3 was detected in an alternative reading frame overlapping the capsid-encoding ORF2 (Table 4). 88.4\u201396.5 24.3 25.6\u201331.2 26.4\u201328.0 93.9\u201396.9 HEV genotypes 1\u20134 (22) 72.1\u2013100 32.5\u201335.1 33.3\u201338.6 37\u201342.5 80.4\u201399.2 a Evolutionary analyses were conducted with MEGA5 (66). the mammalian hepeviruses known at the time of assessment constituted a single genus (41) the avian viruses were suggested previously to form another independent genus (40) the avian viruses were suggested previously to form another independent genus (40) the y axis indicates the number of pairwise identity scores within each range represented on the x axis. the bold line indicates a distance cutoff that separates intratypic and intertypic distances within and between the four suggested hepevirus genera. distances within NM bat hepeviruses are indicated in light gray. Rp gene fragment failed to discriminate bat and avian hepeviruses into two different tentative genera. this did not match closer phylogenetic relatedness of mammalian viruses in larger parts of the ORF1-encoded polyprotein and the ORF2-encoded capsid protein. the distribution of pairwise amino acid distances was also plotted over those complete ORF1 and ORF2 sequences. the sequence of ORF3 was found to be highly distinct between hepeviruses from different hosts. one genus would comprise human HEV genotypes and closely related animal viruses. the other three would include viruses from chiropteran, rodent (rat) and avian (chicken) hosts. despite this, all chiropteran hepeviruses were monophyletic. bats do not appear to constitute reservoirs of mammalian hepeviruses in general. hepevirus evolution may have involved a nonrecent invasion of ancestral mammalian hosts. human infection has been associated with the consumption of pig, wild boar, and deer meat in industrialized countries (10, 37, 58, 68) the viruses carried by pig, boar, and deer meat are closely related to human viruses."}
