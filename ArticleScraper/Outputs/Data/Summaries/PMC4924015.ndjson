{"summary": "individual monitoring system was established in the nuclear industry sector in the 1950s in china. it can objectively reflect the level of the dose received by the radiation workers. individual monitoring is of great importance to the discovery and improvement of the relevant issues in the field of radiation protection. a national meeting on occupational individual dose data statistical analysis and assessment was held in February 1981. it summarized the data of external exposure individual monitoring from 1959 to 1979. the policy of reform and openness to the outside was implemented in 1978. the law of the People\u2019s Republic of China on Prevention and Control of Occupational Disease was adopted in 2001 and in effect since 1 May 2002. the law stipulates that employers must ensure that all the workers involving radiation exposure wear personal dosimeters. about 60%\u201370% of the total is involved in medical diagnosis (X-ray and nuclear medicine imaging) and radiation therapy. average annual effective dose of radiation workers from 1985 to 2012 has shown a significant downward trend. the coverage of individual monitoring in Shanghai and Beijing is more than 95%. personnel should meet the following requirements: (1) being fit for management, technique and quality control required by the programs; (2) being familiar with the relevant laws, standards and documents. (3) Technical director of individual monitoring with junior college diploma or above, or the intermediate technical titles or above, and having experience in related work more than three years; (3) Being qualified through training and examination; (3) Total number of operators is not less than three. there were 190 individual monitoring services in 2009, and in 2012, the number increased to 203. CDCs and institutions of prevention and treatment of occupational disease represent the overwhelming majority of the monitoring services. 87.5% of thermoluminescence detectors readers from 56 individual monitoring services were domestic equipment. 92.44% of the individual monitoring services were using Lithium Fluoride (Mg, Cu, P) thermoluminescence detectors in the form of powder or sheets. in 1998, the Industrial Hygiene Laboratory of the Ministry of Health developed software for data processing and file management of individual monitoring for radiation workers. problems existing in the software of individual monitoring information management system were discussed in selected references [13,14,15] the China Register of Radiation Workers (CRRW) was officially released by the Ministry of Health on 25 November 2009. the system has authorized 212 users, including 180 individual monitoring services and 32 supervision departments. by 2014, there had been 2 million monitoring records in the central database of 330,000 workers belonging to 35,000 radiation users countrywide. unfinished large dose verification varies throughout the country. annual per capita effective doses are declining, from 2.15 mSv (1986\u20131990) to 0.53 mSv (2009\u20132013) the number of workers who should be monitored is only the number of radiation workers. about 60%\u201370% of the total is involved in medical diagnosis (X-ray and nuclear medicine imaging) 223,000 radiation workers are working in 53,000 medical diagnoses and radiation therapy institutions. in the non-nuclear industrial sectors, radiation workers are distributed mainly in eastern and central china. most of the radiation workers are working in uranium mines. a producer, distributor and/or user of radioisotope and radiation generator shall perform individual monitoring and occupational health examination of radiation workers for production, distribution and use of radioisotope and radiation generator. the detailed requirements of the individual monitoring period, individual monitoring file, wearing of dosimeters, qualification review of individual monitoring services, delivery of the reports, and report procedure of individual monitoring results. the provincial health administrative departments are responsible for the qualification examination and approval of individual monitoring services. the qualification certificate of radiological health services is valid for four years. the certification certificate is valid for four years. internal individual monitoring has not been implemented in most areas of china. most units feature a small size and small amount of work. most units are unable to undertake comprehensive tasks due to weak capacity. the individual monitoring takes a longer time period of about three months in most areas of china. regulation requires that the individual monitoring period be one month in general, and should not exceed three months at a maximum. fading of dosimeter signal due to long-time wearing would seldom affect the monitoring results. china began to establish the occupational health management system of radiation workers in the system under the framework of the IAEA CPR (CPR/9/037) by 2014, there had been 2 million monitoring records in the central database of 330,000 workers belonging to 35,000 radiation users countrywide. the online version is comprised of six function modules, such as query, statistical analysis, data management, report cards, system management and exit. summary tabulations can be generated by using the online version [16] effective doses in industrial applications are declining, from 2.15 mSv (1986\u20131990) to 0.53 mSv (2009\u20132013) annual per capita effective doses in each occupation category are declining. it probably benefits from the significant improvement of occupational protection level in china\u2019s medical and industrial sectors. the number of people who should be monitored was identified according to the relevant national standard and regulations [2,3] the number of people who should be monitored is only the number of radiation workers. by the end of 2013, a total of 8678 workers were working in the field of nuclear medicine in china [17] there is a lack of formal and unified procedure to handle the \u201cbig dose\u201d and assign the \u201cnominal dose\u201d in the actual monitoring work. there is a lack of formal and unified procedure to handle the \u201cbig dose\u201d and assign the \u201cnominal dose\u201d in the actual monitoring work. there are about 30,000 to 40,000 aircrew members in china. it is estimated that radiation doses to pilots and stewards are 1.53 mSv/a and 1.90 mSv/a respectively [24]. special attention should be paid to breast cancer, leukemia and the impact of cosmic rays on the fetus. a total of 8678 workers were working in the field of nuclear medicine in china [17] by the end of 2013, a total of 50,000 medical workers were engaged in the clinical work of interventional radiology by 2006 [18], and newer and more accurate data have not been seen. the risk of subcapsular opacity of the eye lens increased significantly compared with conventional radiologists in the same hospitals. ten million miners working in more than 8000 state-owned mines and 100,000 other mines, including coal mines. radon concentration in 15% of underground mines exceeds 1000 Bq/m3. some radiation workers are unwilling to wear personal dosimeters or simply put them in a drawer. they want to test the sensitivity of the dosimeters and deliberately place them under the X-ray beams, making them irradiated. radiation protection awareness of staff needs to be further strengthened."}
