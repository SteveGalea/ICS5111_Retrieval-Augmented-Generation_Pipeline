{"summary": "the health sector is already known as a \u2018high-hazard\u2019 employment zone. workers provide routine clinical care under circumstances clearly safer than an emergency response. other hazard categories include chemical, physical and psychological risks. duty of care principle appears in professional codes of ethics for health workers to provide care for their patients. it is generally defined as an obligation to conform to certain standards of conduct for the protection of others against an unreasonable risk of harm. bola treatment projects across Guinea, liberia and Sierra Leone care for about one-third of the total patients affected by the crisis. experienced MSF staff conduct a health risk analysis (Action 1). a general profile is determined for any new mission being considered. the overall risk is graded with a specific tool to determine if the risk is acceptable. staff are informed of the right to withdraw from work if they do not feel safe. a written consent is requested of the staff member to ensure their understanding of the remaining risk. each site has the capacity to isolate and treat potentially infected staff. more than 400 health workers had already been infected. existing IPC guidance for filovirus haemorrhagic fever was available. WHO-convened teams had essential training. MSF experience, pandemic planning and emergency response starts with the comprehensive organisation of the care mission from a safety perspective. this requires anticipating hazards and providing linked prevention services, training commensurate to the significant hazards present and appropriate protective equipment for caregivers. these duty of care actions form a fortified framework of safety and health protections."}
