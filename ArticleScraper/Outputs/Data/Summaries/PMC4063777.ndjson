{"summary": "viral attachment and cell entry host factors are important for viral replication, pathogenesis, and the generation and sustenance of immune responses after live rubella vaccination. a tag-SNP approach was used in candidate gene study to assess the role of selected cell surface receptor genes, attachment factor-related genes, along with other immune genes in the genetic control of immune response variations after live rubella vaccination. new cellular receptors and attachment factors are plausible genetic regulators of measles vaccine-induced immunity after rubella vaccination. poliovirus (Poliovirus receptor, PVR/CD155, Nectin-5) and herpesvirus (poliovirus receptor-related protein 2, PVRL2/CD112, Nectin-2) in infection, disease pathogenesis and immunity. the Rochester cohort comprised a sample of 1,145 individuals from three independent age-stratified random cohorts of healthy schoolchildren and young adults from all socioeconomic strata. between July 2005 and September 2006, we enrolled an additional 1,076 healthy older adolescents and healthy adults from armed forces personnel at the Naval Health Research Center in San Diego, CA. rubella virus stock (vaccine virus HPV77) was diluted to a working concentration of 1.2103 plaque-forming units (PFU)/mL, and was added (30 L) to an equal volume of diluted serum. the plate was incubated for 1.5 hour at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2. the cells were incubated for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2. genotyping effort included follow-up on 197 previously identified genetic associations between SNPs in immune response genes. a total of 571 additional SNPs on the GoldenGate 768-plex panel were filled with candidate tagSNPs selected from eight newly discovered viral receptor genes. the genotyping quality was high, with a mean SNP call rate of 99.7% and 99.8%. Statistical Methods/Analysis Summaries of the subject characteristics were obtained within the two study cohorts, counts and percentages for categorical features. medians and interquartile ranges (25th and 75th percentiles) for continuous features. a fixed effects meta-analysis was performed for each SNP [37] in order to determine which SNPs were potentially associated with neutralizing antibody titers across the two study cohorts. the results were compared between the two cohorts. all subjects included in the current rubella vaccine study had a documented receipt of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. a modified version of the immunocolorimetric-based neutralization method was used to measure rubella virus-specific neutralizing antibodies. DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS and 50 g/mL Gentamicin (Gibco; Invitrogen, CA, USA) was added to each well. the plates were developed using an indirect immunocolorimetric method. the neutralization titer was calculated as the highest dilution at which the input virus signal was reduced by at least 50% within the dilution series. the 768 candidate tagSNPs were genotyped using a custom designed 768-plex Illumina GoldenGateTM assay. the genotyping quality was high, with a mean SNP call rate of 99.7% and 99.8%. the estimated concordance of duplicates was 96%\u2013100%. non-autosomal SNPs, or SNPs that had a minor allele frequency less than 0.01, were not included in these population stratification analyses. additive genetic model coded SNP genotypes into a single variable reflecting the number of minor alleles carried by each individual. out of the Rochester (discovery) cohort, 1,029 subjects met all inclusion, exclusion and QC criteria. of these 985 subjects, 542 (55.03%) were Caucasians. median age at enrollment was 15 years (IQR, 13, 17) for the Rochester cohort, and 23 years (IQR, 22, 27) for the San Diego cohort. 887) San Diego cohort (n = 542) Total (n = 1,429) Age at Enrollment Median, IQRa (Years) 15 (13, 17) 23 (22, 27) 17 (14, 22) Age at Last Vaccination (Years) Median, IQRa (Years) 6.4 (4.6, 8.5) 3.0 (2.2, 3.9) 5.2 (3.1, 7.5) Gender (N, %) Male 487 (54.9%) heterozygous genotype of these PVR SNPs consistently associated with a significant decrease (> 2-fold) in neutralizing antibody titers after rubella vaccination in both cohorts. heterozygous genotype of these PVR SNPs (no homozygous minor allele genotype was observed) was associated with a significant decrease (> 2-fold) in neutralizing antibody titers after rubella vaccination in both cohorts. homozygous minor allele genotype of a SNP (rs16895223) in the putative rubella virus receptor gene MOG (myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein) was associated with a decrease in rubella-specific antibodies (p0.049, Table 2).

CD155/PVR may play a role in Th2 differentiation and humoral immunity by polarizing nave CD4+T cells to a Th2 phenotype. this may have downstream effects on rubella virus-specific humoral immunity by either modulating the unspecific (or specific) virus attachment/entry, replication and immune response priming or, more likely, by modulating Th1/Th2 cell differentiation. moG is an adhesion molecule that is important in nerve myelination. it is implicated as a target antigen in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune demyelinating diseases. however, rubella virus cell tropism and infectivity suggest other, yet undiscovered, cellular receptors and adhesion factors exist for this pathogen. DC-SIGN (Cell-Specific Intercellular adhesion molecule-3-Grabbing Non-integrin, CD209) is a C-type lectin that mediates dendritic cell function and activation of CD4+ T cells. molecule is exploited by many viruses for attachment and/or cellular entry. RARB is a receptor for retinoic acid, the biologically active metabolite of vitamin A. it regulates antigen presentation, lymphocyte homing, proliferation of B and T cells, T-helper differentiation, cytokine production, T cell activation and cytotoxicity. RARB SNPs/haplotypes and variations in measles-specific neutralizing antibody levels and cellular immune outcomes after vaccination. 2AK2 gene (intronic SNP rs4648212) associated with whole rubella virus-specific IgG levels using single-SNP and/or multigenic assessment analysis [5], [7]. other SNP associations identified in previous studies were not confirmed in the current study. limitations of our study reflect the fact that the characteristics of the study participants were different between the two study cohorts. the strengths of our study include the use of a clinically relevant immune outcome to assess vaccine response. a significant strength is the genetic association analysis approach. the identified genes and genetic variants will be further fine mapped in order to identify candidate functional variants in the genomic regions tagged by the original SNP (if not functional)"}
