{"summary": "aim We aimed to explore the knowledge, attitudes and behaviours of healthcare workers in the Kingdom, particularly focusing on the recent disease of international significance MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) most of the cases in health care workers occurred in the early period of the outbreak [6]. results Of the 1500 invited to participate in the survey, responses were received from 1216 health care workers. this included 267 (22%), medical practitioners, 685 (56.5%) nurses, and 264 other healthcare workers. the majority of participants were Saudi (87.9%), and had diploma qualifications (64.5%). 75 (28.10) 218 (31.8) 58 (22) 351 0.02 No 192 (71.9) 462 (67.4) 203 (76.9) 857 Don\u2019t Know 0 (0) 5 (0.7) 3 (1.1) 8 Do you think that Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS a problem in this community\" 123 (46.1) 448 (65.4) 173 (65.5) 744 0.001 Sometimes avoid body contact whenever HCWs are in a public area. a significant minority (28.9%) of participants had worked at facilities where MERS-CoV had been diagnosed. 149 (55.8) 345 (50.4) 121 (45.8) 615 0.001 Some infected people had mild symptoms (such as cold-like symptoms) 196 (3.4) 407 (59.4) 149 (56.4) 752 0.001 MERS-CoV has spread from ill people to others through close contact 233 (87.3) 530 (77.4) 189 (71.6) 952 0.001 Higher risk for getting MERS-CoV or having a severe case include some infected people had no symptoms 127 (47.6) 208 (30.4) 79 (29.9) 414 0.001 MERS-CoV infected patient need isolation 253 (94.8) 616 (89.9) 228 (86.4) 1097 0.001 * Healthcare Workers; ** p values represent results of chi-squared test for the null hypothesis of no difference in Correct responses of the HCWs knowledge about MERS-CoV. nearly two thirds of the HCWs (61.2%) reported anxiety about contracting MERS-CoV from patients patient. more than half (56.8%) reported avoiding contact with others in public areas. majority believed patients with emerging infectious diseases should be managed in specialised centres. only 22.8% reported having received training about dealing with infectious disease outbreaks, 37.1% reported training in infection control policies and procedures, 54.4% reported training in hand hygiene and 45.6% reported training in N95 mask wearing techniques. are the HCWs becoming more eager to apply infection control measures after the MERS outbreak?
