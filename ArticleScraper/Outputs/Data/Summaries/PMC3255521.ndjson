{"summary": "the Darwin\u2019s evolution theory ensures that the relationships between species can be expressed within a tree. but the exploration of large trees (and graphs) is not easy. an automatic coloring tool for tree exploration has been proposed by Fua and co-authors:5,6. phyloView4 is a non-linear dimensionality reduction method. it is designed to map items (generally from a high dimensional Euclidean space) onto a discrete grid. the grid is discrete, the visualisation of gaps between clusters is uneasy. if hierarchical classifications are often involved in automatic coloration of SOM, the tree is not the input of the algorithm, but a step in the method. such methods can be considered, however, as sources of inspiration for the present paper. an automatic coloring tool for tree exploration has been proposed by Fua and co-authors:5,6 in order to explore a given taxonomy. each node can then be related to a color according to a chosen LUT (Look-Up Table) this approach suffers from a major shortcoming: the leaf ordering is not unique. PhyloView4 has been specially designed to display taxonomy and other analyses (phylogenetic trees) together. the user has to define the colors for taxonomic groups that are relevant from his point of view. if the grid is discrete, the visualisation of gaps between clusters is uneasy. the Genbank taxonomy can not be considered as a conclusive phylogeny. we are only looking here for a way to display any given hierarchical classification, whether it is considered a phylogeny, a taxonomy or so. two cases are possible: Edge lengths are known. the distance between two species corresponds to the sum of the length of edges connecting them. a geometrical progression - right insert (B)-, d(A,B)/d(N1,N2) = 13/8 d(A,C)/d(N1,N2) = 11/4 d(A,B) d(A,C) d(A,N1) + d(B,N1) + d(N1,N2) and d(A,C) = d(A,N1) + d(N1,N2) and d(A,C) = d(A,N1) + d(N1,N2) and d(A,C) = d(A,N1) + d(N1,N2) and d(A,C) = d(A,N1) + the output of DD-HDS is the set of coordinates in a 2D space (coordinates of species i are noted Xi,j where j 1, 2). this fact is not a drawback because we are less concerned by distances preservation than subclasses segmentation. the norm of item i is i X i, 1 \u2032\u2032 + X i, 2 \u2032\u2032 and its angle is i = cos1 (X\u2032\u2032i,1/i) if X\u2032\u2032i,2 0 and i = cos1 (X\u2032\u2032i,1/i) otherwise. the map is related to the HSB colorimetric conic-shaped space. Embedding of 2046 species in the HSB colorimetric space, according to the Genbank taxonomy. angle corresponds to hue while distance to centre corresponds to saturation. step 3: Each species located in the colorimetric subspace is consequently given a unique color. the species coloring can therefore be used in subsequent analyses to visualise the taxonomic relationships (as done in section 3). ms with nuclear cells, ie, animals, plants and fungus among other species. ms with nuclear cells, ie, animals, plants and fungus among other species. ms with nuclear cells, ie, animals, plants and fungus among other species. species C are linked by node N1 by node N2. d(x, y) corresponds to the distance between elements x and y in the tree. d(x, y) corresponds to the distance between elements x and y in the tree. linear, as well as non-linear Multi-Dimensional Scaling methods preserve the distances between data \u201cas much as possible\u201d according to criteria depending on the method. to achieve this goal, we have chosen the DD-HDS algorithm (Data-Driven High Dimensional Scaling),19. mapped, data are translated and rescaled so as to occupy a circle having a radius equal to 1. coordinates are subsequently centred X\u2032i,j =Xi,j mean (Xi,j) and rescaled X i, j \u2032\u2032 = X i, j \u2032 / max i ( j X i, j \u2032 / max i) a position in a circle is characterised by hue and saturation values. a position in a circle is characterised by hue and saturation values. a position in a circle is characterised by hue and saturation values. results ColorPhylo is tested on two biological applications. the first refers to a published ornithological study,20 the second is related to the analysis of genomic signatures. it has to be remembered that on the one hand we study specified knowledge related to a given dataset. the data come from.20 A biological analysis can be found in that paper. this figure is similar to Figure 1 in Bellemain\u2019s and co-authors20. paths are derived from a rooted tree where edge lengths are unknown. taxonomic distances are calculated according to the procedure described in section 2.2, subsection II. colors are then selected according to section 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5. signature is species specific: it allows finding the species of origin of a DNA fragment with a fairly good efficiency. proximity between species in terms of genomic signature is known to be linked to evolutionary proximity. the similarity between genomic signatures accurately matches the taxonomic tree of the species, the signatures come from. a coloring based on the taxonomic tree allows easy observation of the genetic groups. we performed the analysis on the same dataset, according to the Fua et al5,6 coloring method. the interactive local stretching and compression of the LUT can not be implemented here. a comparison between ColorPhylo and the Fua et al algorithm from the present figures would be highly unfair. taxonomic distances are calculated according to the procedure described in section 2.2, subsection II. Species are embedded in a two-dimensional space generated from the taxonomic distance matrix. data embedded in the colorimetric space are displayed in Figure 7. color code provided by ColorPhylo and Figure 7 illustrates the spatial organisation of genomic signatures. color proximity between items expresses proximity between species from the genomic signature point of view. colorphylo can be adapted to fit color-impaired users\u2019 requirements. the method can be adapted to other contexts. the method can be extended to the analysis of any kind of data. matlab version of ColorPhylo is available at http://sy.lespi.free.fr/ColorPhylo-homepage.html."}
