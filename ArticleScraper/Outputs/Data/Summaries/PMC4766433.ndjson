{"summary": "the proportion of swine influenza viruses with truncated or full-length PA-X was stratified by year. we analyzed the frequency of the PA-X truncations in SIV by year based on all SIV sequences available in the national center for biotechnology information (NCBI) influenza Viruses Resource. system of wild type TR H1N2 SIV has 41 amino acids in the X domain of PA-X was established as previously described10. the X-ORF of Sw-41X(WT) virus was extended to the full-length 61 amino acids X domain by substituting the stop codon to tryptophan at the 42nd amino acid position in X-ORF without altering PA ORF. PK15 cells were infected with recombinant viruses at an MOI of 0.01. trachea and lung explants were inoculated with 106 TCID50 of each virus. truncation of PA-X promoted viral production in pigs. the nasal turbinates, tracheas, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALFs) from three pigs in each inoculated group were collected for virus detection at 3 and 5 dpi. clinical signs of the remaining three pigs were monitored daily throughout the duration of the study. s with virus titers of 104.5 TCID50/ml and 103.5 TCID50/ml. virus was only detectable in two of three pigs in Sw-61X group. titers of 3.5 0.3 TCID50/ml and 1.9 0.3 TCID50/ml at 2 and 4 days post-contact. the value of Sw-41X(WT) was significantly different from Sw-61X (P 0.05, ANOVA). three pigs from the infection group and one pig from the control group were anesthetized. their lungs were collected for evaluation of histopathology (H&E) and immunohistochemistry at 5 dpi. open arrows show that SIV-positive signals were detected in lungs of infected piglets. scores of microscopic lesions (B) and SIV-positive signals (C) in lungs were evaluated blinded by two independent pathologists. induction of type I interferon (IFN-I) establishes an antiviral state which impedes viral replication and spread in host cells12. Recently, the PA-X protein of the influenza virus was demonstrated to be involved in the function of host shutoff which could inhibit IFN-I expression9. expression levels of IFN- and IFN- mRNA were quantified by real-time PCR. total RNA was extracted from 100 L of the homogenates. expression levels of IFN- and IFN- mRNA were quantified by real-time PCR. the proportion of swine influenza viruses with truncated or full-length PA-X was stratified by year. we analyzed the frequency of the PA-X truncations in SIV by year based on all SIV sequences available in the national center for biotechnology information (NCBI) influenza Viruses Resource. the X-ORF of Sw-41X(WT) virus was extended to the full-length 61 amino acids X domain by substituting the stop codon to tryptophan at the 42nd amino acid position in X-ORF. this PA-X-extended H1N2 virus was named Sw-61X. PK15 cells were infected with recombinant viruses at an MOI of 0.01. supernatants were collected at indicated time. porcine nasal turbinate, trachea, and lung explants were inoculated with 106 TCID50 of each virus. the nasal turbinates, tracheas, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALFs) from three pigs in each inoculated group were collected for virus detection at 3 and 5 dpi. five nave pigs were maintained as a control group and were mock-inoculated with 2 ml PBS per nostril. viral shedding was detected in all pigs co-housed with Sw-41X(WT) with titers of 3.5 0.3 TCID50/ml and 1.9 0.3 TCID50/ml. virus was only detected in two of three pigs in Sw-61X group at 2 dpc. the value of Sw-41X(WT) was significantly different from Sw-61X (P 0.05, ANOVA). three pigs from the infection group and one pig from the control group were anesthetized. pigs exposed to Sw-41X(WT) showed increased SIV-positive signals in lungs. bronchial and vessel walls around inflammatory cells, including lymphocytes and monocytes. triangle indicates desquamation of epithelial cells of the mucous membrane. bronchial and vessel walls around inflammatory cells were detected. induction of type I interferon (IFN-I) establishes an antiviral state which impedes viral replication and spread in host cells12. expression levels of IFN- and IFN- mRNA in porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) and lungs of pigs infected with each virus were significantly lower than Sw-61X. expression levels of IFN- and IFN- mRNA were quantified by real-time PCR. total RNA was extracted from 100 L of the homogenates. expression levels of IFN- and IFN- mRNA were quantified by real-time PCR. discussion Adaptation is thought to be the driving force in evolution. pigs are proposed to be opportune intermediate hosts for the generation of novel influenza viruses with pandemic potential14,15. despite the pivotal role of pigs in the ecology of influenza A viruses, few virulence markers of influenza virus in pig are identified. NS1 protein, along with NS1, PB2, PB1, PA and PB1-F2 have been shown to be involved in the IFN-I response modulation27. the most prominent IFN-I antagonist in influenza virus is the NS1 protein which can suppress the IFN-I response by interacting with RIG-I. truncated PA-X was more effective in inhibiting IFN-I mRNA expression in PAMs and pigs through the shutoff activity of PA-X. truncated PA-X conferred increased viral pathogenicity, replication and transmissibility in pigs, promoted viral growth in PK15 cells and swine respiratory tissues infected ex vivo, and greater inhibition of host IFN-I expression. the 293T, MDCK, and PK15 cells were kept in our laboratory. the DMEM and RPMI 1640 media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco), 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 g/ml of streptomycin. all of the cells cultured at 37 \u00b0C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. supernatants were sampled at 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 hours post-inoculation (hpi) and titrated by inoculating MDCK cells in 96-well plates. all respiratory explants were cultured at an air-liquid interface in 12-well plates at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2 atmosphere. five uninfected pigs were maintained as a control group and were mock-inoculated with 2 ml PBS per nostril. three infected pigs from each group were removed to a separate room with three nave pigs at 2 days post-inoculation. clinical signs were observed by veterinary inspections at a fixed time daily throughout the duration of the study (14 days) the detection of swine influenza antigen in lung was executed through a ranked sore of 0\u20134. the indication of the scores was as follows: 0, no SIV-antigen-positive cells; 1, 1\u201310 positive cells; 2, 11\u201330 positive cells; 3, 31\u2013100 positive cells; and 4, = or > 100 positive cells. 293T cells were transfected with 500 ng of empty vector or different PA-X proteins respectively. 200 ng of an IFN--promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid (pIFNbLuc) and 20 ng of a plasmid constitutively expressing Renilla luciferase (pRL-TK from Promega) were transfected. the animal use protocol was approved by the animal welfare committee of the CAU. the human embryonic kidney cell (293T), Madin Darby canine kidney cell (MDCK), porcine kidney cell (PK15) and porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) were kept in our laboratory. substitution from stop codon (UAG) to tryptophan (UGG) codon at position 42 in the X-ORF did not change the PA ORF (Fig. 2). Rescued viruses were detected using haemagglutination assays. each viral segment was sequenced to confirm sequence identity. pigs were free of influenza virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), classic swine fever virus (CSFV), pseudorabies virus (PRV) and M. hyopneumoniae infections were obtained from Beijing Center of SPF Swine Breeding & Management. five uninfected pigs were maintained as a control group and were mock-inoculated with 2 ml PBS per nostril. one section from each tissue sample was stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain. another section was processed for immunohistological staining with a rabbit polyclonal antibody (orb176401; Biorbyt, USA) against influenza A virus NP. 1 cycle at 95 \u00b0C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 15 s and 60 \u00b0C for 1 min. expression values for each gene, relative to RPL4, were calculated using the 2CT method. se activity was measured using GloMax 96 microplate luminometer (Promega, USA) the relative luciferase activity of the group with the empty vector was set as 100%, and the other groups were presented relative to that."}
