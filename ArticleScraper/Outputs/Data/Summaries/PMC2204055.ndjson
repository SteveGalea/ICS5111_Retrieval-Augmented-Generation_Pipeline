{"summary": "the 1918 influenza pandemic is the most devastating epidemic of the 20th century. we use data from several communities in Maryland, USA and two ships that experienced well-documented outbreaks of influenza in 1918. we estimate the serial interval and reproductive number throughout the course of each outbreak. important parameters for understanding disease transmission are the reproductive number and the serial interval [3] the effective reproductive number defines the average number of secondary infections an infected will create at a given point in the epidemic. this parameter takes into account that not all contacts of an infected individual are with susceptible persons, as well as the impact of public health control measures. method essentially estimates a curve for the effective reproductive number that traces the epidemic curve, lagged by the average serial interval length. this nonparametric method presupposes information on the serial interval distribution. most methods for estimating the reproductive number rely on limited contact tracing information but not a full estimate of the serial interval. the results illustrate the differences in infectious disease dynamics between outbreaks in a closed population and a dynamic community. the results from this method are compared to that of [12]. the method builds on that described by [21]. we assume that the population is closed, that all cases are observed, and use daily case counts only (i.e. number of new cases each day) Xij represents the number of cases that appear on day j that are infected by individuals that appeared sick on day i. the parameters of this curve describe the initial height of the curve (approximately a+b), the point of inflection (d), the curvature over the inflection (c) and the final height of the curve (a) these parameters have biological meaning in this setting where the initial height corresponds to the values of Ri prior to intervention. the final height would describe the ultimate value of Ri, which typically is less than one, indicating that disease transmission is in a sub epidemic state. the standard deviation of the 1000 estimates was used as the standard error estimates. these results make their standard error estimates infeasible to estimate in this case. we do not present standard error estimates for the results obtained using their methodology. out of 989 passengers (156 crew members, 829 soldiers, 4 civilians) 313 became sick with influenza over a 40 day period. most of the cases occurred within the first fourteen days. 470 cases were reported (AR = 0.43) in the 40 days of the epidemic. we assume that the total number of cases produced by those on day i, Xi, are Poisson distributed with parameter Ni Ri, where Ri is the reproductive number for cases on day i. we further assume that X i = Xi,i+1, Xi,i+2,...,Xi,i+k follows a multinomial distribution with parameters Xi, p, k, where p = p1, p2,...,pk represent the distribution of the the final height would describe the ultimate value of Ri, which typically is less than one, indicating that disease transmission is in a sub epidemic state. the method described by [12] estimates the generation time distribution using a likelihood based method. the effective reproductive number is estimated using the method described by [7]. this is due to the non-independence in the data and lack of theoretical underpinnings for the method that they propose. however, we do not present standard error estimates for the results obtained using their methodology. we compute one-step-ahead residuals and implement a cross validation approach to analyze the generalizeability of the estimates obtained from each methodology. the logistic model fits this as accurately as possible. this is likely due to some of the missing data at the beginning of the epidemic. this is likely due to some of the missing data at the beginning of the epidemic. communities Baltimore MLE

generation time distribution. however, the model suffers somewhat as evidenced by the CV measures. estimates of the first moment vary much more for the ships compared to the MLE method. for the communities, they tend to be consistently around 10 for the Garske et al. method and vary much more for the MLE method. also of interest in these results are the large error estimates, particularly for Cumberland, but also to a smaller extent for Frederick. effective reproduction number estimates for the MLE method and the wallinga and Tuenis method. in the Maryland communities the initial reproductive number tended to be slightly lower. the effective reproductive number peaked relatively late in the epidemic. overall it took longer for the reproductive number to drop below one in these communities (typically between 30\u201340 days) generalizeability In Table 4, we present the results of the residual analysis. for the communities, it is the sum of the residuals predicting the other four communities using the estimates from the other ship's data. the CV measure for Baltimore is the sum of all the residuals that come from using the estimates for Baltimore to predict the other four communities' outbreaks. both methods assume that the population is closed, there are no missing cases and no migration to or from the population. the results of these models can be sensitive to underreporting initially in the epidemic. we see this clearly in Boonah, where it was acknowledged that there was underreporting early on and this led to us getting very high estimates for the initial reproductive number. the greatest difference between the spread of influenza in a closed population is a large initial reproductive number that declines rapidly. in more diffuse communities, it is likely that the reproductive number will not decline as rapidly."}
