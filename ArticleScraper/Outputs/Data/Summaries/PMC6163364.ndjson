{"summary": "monocytes/macrophages by definition are non-dividing cells with a short half-life that makes viral replication difficult or almost impossible. a limited lifespan, limited cell resources, programmed cell death and an immune response are major restrictive characteristics of monocytes/macrophages as a permissive system. monocytes/macrophages are powerful producers of cytokines/chemokines. monocytes/macrophages are powerful producers of cytokines/chemokines. this can be modulated and used by viruses for infection spread and establishment. monocytes/macrophages are key cells of the immune system that orchestrate various physiological and pathological processes of an infectious and non-infectious nature. the basic biology of viral reservoirs, knowledge of viral transmission systems and \u201cbackup\u201d cells will be of great help in the advancement of effective viral therapies. macrophages are able to sense the time at which an injury is terminated and thus start the resolution process of inflammation. specific stimuli include cytokines, growth factors, prostaglandins, fatty acids and pathogen-derived molecules. polarization favours virus establishment, as shown for HIV-1, which induces acute inflammation. monocyte and macrophages are highly endocytic and partially phagocytic. they are involved in a variety of functions including repair mechanisms, homeostasis, metabolic processes and pathogenesis. both acute and chronic inflammatory programming of macrophages can be used by viruses for their dissemination, replication and survival. monocytes/macrophages have been shown for the persistence or spread of more than 35 viruses belonging to 13 different families. ssRNA and dsDNA agents lead to a variety of diseases including formidable immunodeficiency syndrome, virus-induced microcephaly and Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome. infected M produces high level IL-1\u00df, IL-6, TNF (flow cytometry) -M demonstrated no cytopathic changes. -M are not the major reservoirs of VSV gRNA at late times (>60 days) NS [33] 6 Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) Coronaviridae (+) ssRNA Mouse Model of multiple sclerosis Mouse Mouse peritoneal M -M disseminate virus into CNS.

CHIKV-infected RAW264.7 M showed high production of TNF-, IL-6 and GM-CSF (QPCR) -RRV-infected M in vitro displayed restricted cytopathic effects. -Infected M showed impaired phagocytic activity. -M dissiminate HIV to CD4+ T cells and central nervous system. bovine herpesvirus-4 (BHV-4) Herpesviridae dsDNA Cattle, rabbits Endometritis, vulvovaginitis and mastitis Bovine M cell line (BOMAC) cell culture -Virus cause cell death of majority of BOMAC cells and persists in surviving cells. infected M produce high level of IL-8, MCP-1 due to TLR9 and TLR-2 activation (ELISA). -Monocytes produce high level of IFN in response to EBV (ELISA). -IL-10-dependent M2 polarization of infected TAMs (ELISA) dsDNA mouse Acute infection of lung epithelial cells Balb/c mice. virus persists in alveolar and peritoneal lung mononuclear cells. virus must find a way to move near to a host cell. virus-cell interaction can occur through low- or high-affinity receptors. receptors can target viruses for endocytosis, phagocytosis, macropinocytosis or membrane fusion. it can be assumed that the uptake pathway and type of receptors involved are the first adaptation step necessary to the prosperous survival of viruses. monocytes/macrophages are known to be a professional antigen-presenting cells and \u201cprofessional\u201d phagocytes. these cells are well equipped with general receptors and several sensors. receptors can initiate and control immune responses to invading pathogens. several viruses (HIV, CMV, RSV, KHSV) use heparan sulphate proteoglycans. heparan sulphate proteoglycans play multiple roles in assisting viral infection. phosphatidylserine mimics membrane fragments generated during apoptosis. olin, heparan sulphate proteoglycans Replication [75,81] 2 Influenza virus Endocytosis, Phagocytosis Sialic acid sugars Replication [76] 3 Vesicular stomatitis virus endocytosis Phosphatidylserine No replication [32,79] 5 Japanese encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, Dengue virus Phagocytosis * DC-SI coxsackievirus launches signalling pathways resulting in the induction of both tumour necrosis factor- and interleukin-1 production by human macrophages [91]. coxsackievirus launches signalling pathways resulting in the induction of both tumour necrosis factor- and interleukin-1 production by humans. CD4 plays a prominent role in HIV entry and virus-cell interaction for T cells and for monocytes/macrophages. CD4 creates structural changes in viral proteins that allow HIV-1 to bind to a coreceptor expressed on the host cell. hMRC1-mediated uptake of HIV-1 by macrophages does not lead to productive infection in macrophages. some viruses infect macrophages through phagocytosis of apoptotic macrophages that were previously infected by that virus. the fate of viruses and the cells affected by viral agents varies greatly depending upon the virus characteristics. infected monocytes cross the blood-tissue barrier and disseminate viral particles as a specific parcels into the central nervous system. monocytes must make a cell fate decision after three days of circulation in blood vessels. they evade apoptosis and prolong the cell\u2019s life span via regulation of specific apoptotic pathways. the size of the virus reservoir is small. macrophages are appealing to HIV-1 infection in many ways. they support productive replication and a life-long persistence as a latent reservoir. phages inhibit apoptosis signal regulating kinase-1. resistance to apoptosis also involves modulation of mitochondrial pathway. macrophages secrete proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. the persistence of apoptotic neutrophils and their apoptotic bodies at the inflammatory site may maintain the inflammatory state through persistent stimulation of proinflammatory cytokines. macrophages also show anti-HIV-1 cellular restrictions such as the expression of SAMHD1, APOBEC3A, APOBEC3G, tetherin, TRIM5-alpha and MX2 [17], suggesting the substantial importance of macrophages in HIV-1 pathogenesis monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation is partially mediated by caspase-3 activation. HCMV could specifically regulate the polarization of infected monocytes/macrophages to achieve an effective balance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory signals. this regulation may establish a cellular environment conducive for dissemination and persistence of HCMV. cytomegalovirus induces activation of EGFR and the 1 and 3 integrins on the surface of monocytes. the long persistence in liver macrophages was observed for a member of the hepatitis C virus. chronic HCV infection can lead to advanced liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. CHIKV persists in synovial tissue after 18 months in patient after infection [50] with the productive replication of virus in synovial macrophages. despite the induced apoptosis in many cell types, CHIKV appears to launch a specific innate immune response in infected cells. ocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), were observed in macrophages after infection and may contribute to the acceleration of TMEV-induced demyelination resembling multiple sclerosis. alterations in the immune response of those cells contribute to chronic inflammatory responses from macrophages and changes that allow infected macrophages to escape from immune response. viruses, such as retroviruses, flaviviruses, alphaviruses, picornaviruses and rhabdoviruses, are commonly associated with skeletal muscle infection and inflammation. infection causes intense inflammatory response during the reactivation of VZV, leading to widespread necrosis of glial cells and neurons. macrophages are the major target cells of maedi-visna virus despite very limited replication in the animal host. HHV-6 infection is typically non-productive in macrophages. it induces severe functional abnormalities, including the selective suppression of IL-12, a critical cytokine in the generation of antiviral immune responses. 89-fold higher concentrations of PIs are required compared with CD4+ T cells. despite failure of macrophage-HIV eradication, another innovative idea has been successfully implemented. macrophages are central players in the onset of viral arthropathies. macrophages are central players in the onset of viral arthropathies. bindarit-based treatment reduced macrophage infiltration into the muscles and joints. this led to reduced tissue damage and a significant amelioration of disease symptoms. translocation in HIV-1-infected patients compared to healthy controls. gut dysbiosis, accompanied by systemic inflammation and endotoxemia in HCV-infected individuals."}
