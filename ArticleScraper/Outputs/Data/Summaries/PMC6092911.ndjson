{"summary": "serological and virological studies have shown evidence of MERS-CoV infection in camels in the Middle East, as well as in East, North and West Africa [2-5] and in Central Asia [6]. zoonotic MERS has not been reported from the african continent. abattoir workers with exposure to infected camels are a high-risk group for MERS-CoV infection in the Arabian Peninsula. we collected around 20 nasal swabs daily from 12 October to 2 December 2015 and from 11 January to 29 February 2016. a questionnaire was administered to each participant to ascertain demographic information, type and duration of occupational exposure to camels. participants were recruited for a serological study after obtaining informed consent, during April\u2013November 2016. human sera were tested for MERS-CoV antibody using a ppNT assay. a 90% reduction of signal was considered as evidence of neutralisation in the ppNT assay. 2,529 camels tested, 38 of them calves 2 years, 1,400 aged 2\u20134 years and 1,091 aged > 4 years. none of the 1,300 camels tested from 12 October to 2 December 2015 were positive for MERS-CoV RNA. many workers in abattoir reported drinking fresh (unboiled) camel milk, drinking camel urine and the use of camel urine for medicinal purposes. none of the 311 humans tested had any evidence of MERS-CoV antibody in their serum.
