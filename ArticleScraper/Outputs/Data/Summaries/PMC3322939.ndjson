{"summary": "all 474 medical students of the university who were in their clinical years (years 3\u20135) were contacted to inquire whether they had visited the patient\u2019s ward during this period. data collection Students who reported visiting the patient\u2019s ward during the period were given a detailed questionnaire that sought information about demographic characteristics, history of recent illnesses, activities in the ward. a positive test was defined as either seroconversion (>4-fold rise in antibody titer in the paired serum specimens) or a convalescent-phase antibody titer of >1:40. a detailed assessment of the ventilation system and airflow studies could not be performed at the time of the outbreak because of logistic constraints. all 474 medical students of the university who were in their clinical years (years 3\u20135) were contacted to inquire whether they had visited the patient\u2019s ward during this period. data collection Students who reported visiting the patient\u2019s ward were given a detailed questionnaire that sought information about demographic characteristics, history of recent illnesses, activities in the ward. a positive test was defined as either seroconversion (>4-fold rise in antibody titer in the paired serum specimens) or convalescent-phase antibody titer of >1:40. a detailed assessment of the ventilation system and airflow studies could not be performed at the time of the outbreak because of logistic constraints. index case-patient had onset of an illness characterized by fever, cough, runny nose, and malaise. he sought treatment at the Accident and Emergency Department of the Prince of Wales Hospital. his fever (range 38\u00b0C\u201340\u00b0C) did not diminish after receiving various antimicrobial drugs and persisted until March 11, when it gradually subsided. of the 334 respondents, 66 (20%) reported visiting the index patient\u2019s ward during the study period. respondents and nonrespondents did not differ in age and gender. none of the 20 students who appeared for the bedside clinical assessment visited this ward after March 7. titer ranged from 1:80 to 1:1,280, with a geometric mean titer of 1:440. the dates of onset of illness of 16 students with severe acute respiratory syndrome and date of their visit to the index patient\u2019s hospital ward are shown in Figure 2. 11 students reported entering the index patient\u2019s cubicle in the ward. a fifth-year student reported visiting the patient in bed no. 17x. the duration of stay was not associated with illness. the bed of the index patient is shaded. 0, students assigned to examine the patient in this bed who became ill with severe acute respiratory syndrome; x, students assigned to examine the patient in this bed who remained healthy. to further assess the proximity of exposure associated with illness, we analyzed data from 19 of 20 medical students. index patient was administered nebulizer therapy four times per day starting from 2 p.m. on march 6 until March 12. no significant association was noted between their risk for illness and presence in the ward when the nebulizer was in use. none of the ill students reported contact with another ill student or other person with SARS in the 10 days before illness onset. the clinical course and severity of illness in the hepatitis B carrier were similar to the experiences of other students. the air supply from the diffuser in the index patient\u2019s cubicle had the highest supply flow rate (336 L/s) the adjacent exhaust grille had the lowest exhaust flow rate (87 L/s) among all four functional exhaust grilles. the index patient had onset of an illness characterized by fever, cough, runny nose, and malaise. his fever (range 38\u00b0C\u201340\u00b0C) did not diminish after receiving antimicrobial drugs and persisted until March 11. his chest radiograph showed consolidation of the right upper lobe and patchy haziness in the right lower zone. the index patient was identified as the index patient for the outbreak of SARS in prince of Wales hospital on march 12. he was transferred to an isolation room within the ward. the patient was not treated with either ribavirin or steroids. 66 (20%) reported visiting the index patient\u2019s ward. all 50 healthy students had demonstrated antibodies to SARS-CoV. the antibody titer ranged from 1:80 to 1:1,280. the dates of onset of illness of the 16 students are shown in Figure 2. on march 6 had the widest range of incubation period (2\u20136 days) too few students were exposed exclusively on other days to show any pattern. we examined the attack rates of the illness among students based on whether they could recall entering the patient\u2019s cubicle. index patient's cubicle Ill Not ill Total Attack rate (%)a Yes 10 17 27 37.0 Not sure 4 14 18 22.2 No 1 19 20 5.0 Total 15 50 65 23.1 aFisher exact test (2-tailed), p = 0.032;
