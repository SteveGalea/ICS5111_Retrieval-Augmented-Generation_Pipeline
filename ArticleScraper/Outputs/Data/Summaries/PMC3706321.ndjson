{"summary": "caveolae are specialized membrane nanodomains with a distinct -shaped morphology in the membrane. caveolae may act as signaling platforms by allowing signaling molecules to cluster together within their ordered domains. critical cellular processes associated with caveolae include signal transduction, cholesterol homeostasis, and adaptive immune signaling. knockout studies have shown that mice lacking a functional IFN receptor (IFN-R) were unable to cope with an array of viral infections. vaccinia virus, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and semliki forest Virus were highly susceptible to infection. the small size of caveolae and the spatial proximity of proteins prohibit direct visualization of the dynamic interaction between the host cell membrane nanodomains and antiviral receptors using conventional light microscopy. three-dimensional FPALM has achieved a lateral resolution of 30 nm and 75 nm axially [34]. the membrane protein Cav-1 is responsible for maintaining the CRFB1 clustering. we determined that the functional consequence of Cav-1 depletion is CRFB1 dispersion and abrogation of downstream signaling. we will better understand how viruses evade host antiviral mechanisms and can implement this knowledge to develop targeted therapeutics. CRFB1 colocalizes with the zebrafish homolog of IFN-R and is positively correlated. CRFB1 is more prone to random distribution when Cav-1b is knocked down. the role of both Cav-1a and Cav-1b in zebrafish development have been previously revealed using MO knockdown technology. the presence of caveolae in zebrafish has been confirmed via electron microscopy. zebrafish embryos that were injected with Cav-1b MO were infected by static immersion 48 hpf with 1106 TCID50/ml virus. early in infection (0\u201312 hpi), there is no difference in viral burden between Cav-1b morphants and controls. the 18S gene was selected due to its high, relatively stable expression levels. if viral infection globally affected gene expression, then 18S would also be influenced. however, similar results were obtained when 18S primers were used to normalize the quantity of RNA. Kaplan-Meier curves showed survival of Cav-1b morphants compared to controls after viral challenge. uninfected control morphants showed a significant increase in mortality (p = 0.009). the data were significant (two-way ANOVA, p0.05) and correlated with the increased mortality shown at 24 and 48 hpi in the Cav-1b morphant embryos. knockdown of Cav-1b should dissipate antiviral signals, such as gene expression of Stat1. cells were harvested for luciferase measurements 24 hpi. they were harvested for luciferase measurements 24 hpi. a greater reduction in ISRE activity was observed in either SHRV-infected or Cav-1b MO cells. crosslinking studies were performed using bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3) reagent with ZFL cells that were transfected with either either Cav-1b MO or standard control MO. the crosslinking reagent was employed to \u201crescue\u201d the dispersal of CRFB1 that results from cav-1b disruption. compared to uninfected cells, CRFB1 becomes dispersed after infection. values of g(r) in cells with SHRV infection are considered to be random. crosslinking keeps receptor molecules clustered despite caveolin depletion. polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) is a synthetic analog of double stranded RNA (dsRNA) which is associated with viral infection. it leads to the induction of type I IFN and inflammatory cytokines. cells were crosslinked with BS3, exposed to poly(I:C) or both crosslinked with BS3 and exposed to poly(I:C) the clustering of the receptor is essential for downstream signaling. caveolin-1 plays a critical role in keeping the receptor clustered. the results indicate dampening of MxA transcript production. CRFB1 colocalizes with CRFB1 and Corrals CRFB1 in Membrane Domains. CRFB1 localizes to cav-1b-containing membrane domains. rat liver cells express endogenous cav-1b and CRFB1 mRNA. n10 cells were transfected with Cav-1b-PAmCherry (red) and with CRFB1-dendra2 (green) for all images, 60/1.2 NA magnification. the image shows that Cav-1b and CRFB1 colocalize in the cell membrane. zebrafish embryos that were injected with Cav-1b morpholino (MO) to knock down the expression of Cav-1b or control MO were infected 48 hpf with 1106 TCID50/ml virus. results are representative of three separate experiments. early in infection (0\u201312 hpi), there is no difference in viral burden between Cav-1b morphants and controls. by 24\u201348 hpi, Cav-1b morphants have a higher viral burden. we performed knockdown experiments as described [2], [40] after confirming the amount of MO required to knock down Cav1b. at 24 hpi in control MO-injected embryos Cav-1 protein was still detected, while in control MO-injected embryos no Cav-1 protein was found. this result shows effective knockdown of Cav-1b protein expression by morpholino injection. over 70% of the Cav-1b morphants had succumbed to the infection compared to 40% of control infected embryos. the results are due solely to perturbation of the innate immune response. containing membrane domains are being used as a platform for immune signaling through the IFN-R pathway. knockdown of Cav-1b should dissipate antiviral signals, such as gene expression of Stat1 and subsequent induction of ISRE. control MO cells were transfected with either Cav-1b MO or standard control MO. depletion with Cav-1b MO resulted in a significant decrease in ISRE activity compared to control MO samples. a greater reduction in ISRE activity was observed in either SHRV-infected or Cav-1b MO cells when compared to control MO samples. FPALM imaging demonstrated that infection of ZFL cells with virus resulted in dispersion of CRFB1 molecules. similar numbers of CRFB1 molecules are seen in the uninfected cell (12,251) compared to the infected cell (11,358) this indicates that there is no overall loss of surface CRFB1 as a result of infection. crosslinking CRFB1 keeps receptor molecules clustered despite caveolin depletion. cells were co-transfected with MO and expression plasmid via nucleofection. the crosslinking reaction was performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s procedures. dsRNA is associated with viral infection. it is recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRR) [45], [46] and leads to the induction of type I IFN and inflammatory cytokines. depletion of Cav-1b using the MO in ZFL cells is demonstrated in Figure S5. the results indicate dampening of MxA transcript production between control MO and Cav-1b MO prior to rescue of caveolae domains. an additional experiment was performed with cells transfected with both MO and cav-1b plasmid to rescue the effect of the Cav-1b knockdown. cells were then infected with SHRV (Figure 6b) CRFB1 molecules are dispersed and cav-1b-containing membrane domains are disrupted during viral infection, leading to a decrease in the number of cav-1b-containing membrane domains. the data show that in intact cells, CRFB1 molecules are dispersed and cav-1b-containing membrane domains are disrupted during viral infection. type I IFN belongs to a class of cytokines that play a crucial role in the innate immune response to viral infection [47], [48]. Molecular patterns such as viral double stranded RNA are detected by PRR [49], [50], resulting in production of IFN and antiviral proteins. a decrease in Stat1 gene expression was observed at 24 hpi. this indicates that the clustering of CRFB1 is critical for an antiviral response. previous studies in murine embryonic fibroblasts demonstrated that type I IFN receptors (IFN-R) and type II IFN receptors (IFNGR1) were associated with caveolae domains after DRM isolation. studies were performed using either poly(I:C) stimulation or SHRV infection. both of which will induce IFN, the ligand that will bind to CRFB1 and stimulate it. crosslinking reagent is non-specific and may impact cellular function. studies outlined here show viruses can escape the antiviral immune response by downregulating cav-1b protein levels. viral infection alone is enough to decrease cav-1b protein levels. these studies support the hypothesis that cav-1b-containing membrane domains provide the local environment for interaction of critical antiviral receptor molecules. zebrafish used in this study were handled in accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institute of Health. the protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of Maine. dendra-CRFB1 was generated using a dendra2-HA construct [65] in which PstI and XmaI restriction sites were added to CRFB1 by polymerase chain reaction.
