{"summary": "endoplasmic reticulum (ER) maintains cellular homeostasis and participates in lipid synthesis, protein folding, translocation, and post-translational modifications. this disrupts the process of proper protein folding within the ER, finally leading to the accumulation of misfolded or misfolded proteins causing ER stress. in order to repair ER-associated degradation, UPR can activate apoptosis. kinase (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK) and inositol requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) are regulated by master regulator protein, Glucose-regulated protein GRP78 or Binding immunoglobulin Protein (BiP/GRP78) under stressful conditions, the ER luminal domain of these transmembrane molecules including ATF6, PERK, and IRE1 is bound to the chaperone protein BiP transcription factor 6 induces the expression of ER chaperones and ERAD associated molecules. activated PERK attenuates protein synthesis by phosphorylation of eIF2, thereby enabling the translation of eIF2-activating transcription factor-4 (ATF4) which translocates to the nucleus. IRE1 undergoes conformational changes and oligomerizes in the ER membrane. ire1 is ubiquitously expressed and is required for XBP1 mRNA splicing. ire1 is ubiquitously expressed and is required for XBP1 mRNA splicing. ER-resident proteins involved in protein folding include biP/GRP78 and disulfide isomerase. these chaperones participate in refolding and relieving ER stress. the GRP78 promoter contains three ER stress response elements. immune cells in the tumor environment may either activate CD4 helper and CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocytes in an MHC I and MHC II dependent manner. the UPR mediates the signaling between tumor and non-tumor cells. TERS upregulates tumorigenic inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-23) and decrease T cell response. extracellular matrix (ECM) consisting of many distinct components. includes fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, mesenchymal stem cells and adipocytes. a major non-cellular component in the tumor microenvironment is the extracellular matrix (ECM) IRE1 mutants lose their regulated IRE1-dependent decay of mRNA (RIDD) function and show increased cell survival. hypoxia causes the upregulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha. hypoxia triggers PERK signaling in mammalian cell lines. all three branches of the UPR pathway activate NF-kB through different mechanisms. PERK-eIF2 signals translational arrest and increased NF-kB/IkB ratio, leading to NF-kB nuclear translocation. IRE1\u2013TNF receptor-associated factor 2 complexes can bind to NF-kB leading to IkB phosphorylation and degradation. eicosanoid leukotriene C4 has also been reported as a major ER stress mediator. nutrient deficiency activates UPR in an IRE1/XBP-1, PERK-ATF4 and ATF6 dependent manner and stimulates inflammatory cytokine (IL 6), fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor signaling. a programmed signaling cascade gets activated which is known as the unfolded protein response or UPR. it is mediated by three highly specific signaling protein molecules called activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR)-like ER kinase (ER kinase) and inositol requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1). biP/GRP78 dissociates from the sensors thereby activating these signal transducers. activated IRE1 facilitates splicing of XBP1 mRNA and spliced protein translocates to the nucleus to regulate ERAD. cleaved transcription factor 6 induces the expression of ER chaperones and ERAD associated molecules. IRE1 plays the dual role of a transmembrane kinase and endoribonuclease that participates in mRNA splicing to transmit the UPR signal. IRE1 undergoes conformational changes and oligomerizes in the ER membrane. ire1 is ubiquitously expressed and is required for XBP1 mRNA splicing. two proteases, Site-1 protease (S1P) and Site-2 protease (S2P) cleave [14, 15] and release N-terminal, ATF6 (N) that travels to the nucleus to activate UPR target genes. ER-resident proteins involved in protein folding include biP/GRP78 and disulfide isomerase. Activated CAFs in the tumor microenvironment helps tumor cells proliferate by supplying nutrition but also secretes various growth factors. CAF releases a large number of mesenchymal transducing soluble factors to remodel the ECM [20]. Endothelial cells lining tumor blood vessels produce pro-angiogenic factors and also promote migration, metastasis. cells that arise in the bone marrow \u2013 Lymphoid cells - T cells, B cells and NK cells Myeloid cells- Macrophages, neutrophils and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) other cell types- Macrophages, platelets and dendritic cells. premalignant cells have the added advantage of gene mutations. ire1 mutants lose their regulated IRE1-dependent decay of mRNA (RIDD) function. hypoxia leads to UPR activation, which eventually initiates another cycle of cell proliferation and subsequent hypoxia. PERK-eIF2 signals translational arrest and increased NF-kB/IkB ratio. proinflammatory cytokines like IL6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) present in the tumor microenvironment further add to the ER stress induced UPR activation. glucose deprivation in colorectal cancer cells increased cycloxygenase-2, COX-2 and reduced 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase. inflammatory mediator PGE2 promoted cancer cell survival. eicosanoid, leukotriene C4 (LTC4), also reported as major ER stress mediator. the high metabolic demand of the tumor microenvironment activates UPR. ER stress also plays an important role in ER-mitochondrial communication. ER stress drives EMT in in vitro and in animal models of fibrosis. mitochondrial HSP90 chaperone and its related protein, TRAP-1, are abundant in the mitochondria of tumor cells but not in those of healthy tissues. impaired function of mitochondrial HSP90 leads to mitochondrial UPR and the induction of autophagy [61]. XBP1 is also known to modulate endoplasmic reticulum lipid raft associated 2 (ERLIN2) protein expression. RNA Viruses ER stress signaling pathway Virus - viral protein PERK- eIF2 pathway. RNA Viruses ER stress signaling pathway Virus - viral protein PERK- eIF2 pathway. dengue Virus -DENV2 ATF6 pathway - dengue Virus -DENV2 pathway. human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8) or Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV) studies have shown that primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) cells have unspliced XBP-1 mRNA. under ER stress XBP-1 mRNA is processed to XBP-1s, which bind to the KSHV ORF50 promoter. in vitro and clinical studies have shown that induction of ER stress by 2-D-glucose shuts down viral replication and lytic gene expression. this particular sensitivity of PEL cells may control KSHV latency epigenetically. this particular sensitivity of PEL cells may control KSHV latency epigenetically. KSHV infection induced LTA4H serves as a link between KSHV life cycle and its adaptation to the host cell ER stress. ncy, and effective inhibition of these pathways could be used in treatment to control KS/PEL [79\u201382]. the swine fever virus encodes DP71L, which shows homology to HSV ICP34.5 protein and can also associate with the enzyme that dephosphorylates eIF2. ER stress and the UPR have been aiding in viral replication. Viruses can hinder ERAD tuning and can use ERAD-associated machinery to form isolated lipid vesicles for replication and as an escape from immune detection. the professional virus killer gets activated and releases interferons. adenovirus and HSV-1 deliver their genomes into the nucleus of the target cell. RNA/DNA virus may manipulate the host UPR in a way to maintain an environment favorable for its infectivity and persistence in the diseased cell. the host cell generates UPR to promote the ERAD pathway against viral infection by generating loads of misfolded proteins. a family of herpesviruses mimics host molecules and uses host UPR to set up active lytic infection and break dormancy of latent phase. herpesviruses mimic many host molecules and use host UPR to set up active lytic infection. the slower kinetics of these compounds may be associated with a distinct ER stress induced by them. this particular sensitivity of PEL cells may control KSHV latency epigenetically. this particular sensitivity of PEL cells may control KSHV latency epigenetically. KSHV infection downregulates anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving metabolites. it has been proven that VZV differentially induced the upregulation of UPR to deal with viral glycoprotein synthesis. proteins that are expected to induce ER stress at low levels act as inhibitors of ER stress instead. human cytomegalovirus US11 protein and herpesvirus US2 activate UPR to increase degradation of the class I major histocompatibility complex proteins. increased ATF-4 expression induced by eIF2 phosphorylation is beneficial for viral replication. viral vectors are being increasingly used as gene delivery vehicles in gene therapy. Vaccinia viral vectors have also been used for cancer gene therapy. the safety profile of Vaccinia virus has already been determined. stress stimuli in the tumor microenvironment activate UPR, which further influences cellular processes such as metastatic growth, apoptosis, inflammation, and host immune responses. the therapy increases expression of CHOP and caspase 7 leading to inhibition of tumor formation and finally inducing cellular apoptosis. inhibition of the MAPK pathway boosts caspase-4 mediated ER stress induced apoptosis in melanoma cells. antitumor agents decrease GRP78 at the protein level by directly binding GRP78 to facilitate its degradation. XBP1 represents a regulator of plasma cell differentiation. RIDD of mRNA and miR17 depict anti-tumoral features by remodeling of tumoral stroma. XBP1 expression levels are highly correlated to cell survival in ER+ breast cancer patients. new therapeutic antitumoral agents inhibiting ER chaperones level or UPR adaptive and prosurvival pathways can be used as potential cancer therapies with improved outcomes. recently, two anticancer drugs GSK2606414 [128] and GSK2656157 [129] have been introduced. these transducers are regulated by intrinsic timers e.g. prolonged ER stress guides IRE1-dependent decay leading to apoptosis. PERK activation and deactivation are regulated in similar manner. all three branches of UPR may have their own transcriptional factor activity for a single target CHOP. in cancer, versipelostatin, a repressor of GRP78 expression is being used to target the UPR to promote apoptosis or else the usage of proteasomal inhibitors may overload the UPR. the ideal approach would be to compose both targets without any toxicity."}
