{"summary": "the 9-O-acetylation and de-O-acetylation are the most common modifications of sialic acids found in mammalian cell surface sialoglycoconjugates. these modifications can regulate a variety of biological phenomena, including endogenous lectin recognition, tumor antigenicity, virus binding, and complement activation. spermatogenesis is a complicated process of germ cell differentiation in adult testis. there are five types of germ cells, each at a specific developmental stage, found in the seminiferous tubules. they can be divided into three groups according to their DNA content. the cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 0.5 M sodium citrate solution (PH 4.5) the day before use, the cells were spun down and resuspended in PBS with 100 g/mL PI (propidium iodide) and fresh 0.1% DEPC. the cells were stained overnight at 4\u00b0C. cDNA library screening The colonies of full-length cDNA were screened by PCR. human testis Large-Insert cDNA Library (Clontech, Calif) was first converted into plasmid cDNA Library, and then an arrayed cDNA library. pEGFP-C2-HSEI and pEGFP-C2-HSEII were constructed using two sets of primers (HSEI: 5\u2032-GGGGAATTCAATGATATGGTGCTGCAG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GGGGTCGACATTTAGCAACATTGCTCTG-3\u2032) cells were imaged 40 hours after transfection on the fluorescence microscope. seminiferous tubules were collected in DMEM/F12, which contained collagenase. trypsin treatment and a brief treatment with DNase I were used to release the spermatogenic cells from seminiferous tubules. the suspension of cells was filtered with nylon mesh. RNA isolation and differential display PCR Isolation of total RNA was performed with Trizol Reagent (Gibco BRL, Ontario) one hundred nanograms of total RNA was used for differential display RT-PCR. the first chain cDNA was synthesized by using T12G, T12C, and T12A oligo (dT) primers and then was used as template in PCR. pEGFP-C2-HSEI and pEGFP-C2-HSEII were constructed using two sets of primers. pEGFP-C2-HSEI and pEGFP-C2-HSEII were constructed using two sets of primers. pEGFP-C2-HSEI and pEGFP-C2-HSEI were constructed using two sets of primers. recombinant vectors were transfected into BxPC-3 cells by Lipofectin reagent. cells were imaged 40 hours after transfection on the fluorescence microscope. a clone was identified by differential display RT-PCR. H-Lse is 2750 bp in length, encoding a putative protein of 523 amino acids with a molecular weight of 58 kd. the protein is a region containing hydrophobic amino acid residues. by comparison of the protein sequences, we hypothesized that H-Lse is the human counterpart of mouse lysosome sialic acid 9-O-acetylesterase. the expected transcript of H-Lse was approximately 2.7 kb, 6.0 kb, and 7.5 kb. the transcript of approximately 7.5 kb was exclusively expressed in the colon. the transcript was distributed in the testis, colon, small intestine, prostate, and thymus. human embryonic testis (6 months) (400); human adult testis (100); human adult testis (100); d) human adult testis (100); leydig cells (L), spermatogonia (Sg) and spermatocytes (Sc) subcellular localization of H-Lse was visualized by transiently transfecting H-Lse gene fused with GFP into BXPC-3 cells. 4C and 2C cells are sorted: T, 4C; D, 2C; H, 1C. DD-RT-PCR results of 4C and 2C cells. H-Lse is highly expressed in 4C cells. the distribution of H-Lse in various human tissues was analyzed by Northern blot. the expected transcript of H-Lse was approximately 2.7 kb. the transcript of approximately 7.5 kb was exclusively expressed in the colon. negative control of sense probes confirmed the specificity of the results. spermatogonia proliferates in mitotic, meiotic, and postmeiotic phases. spermatocytes accomplish chromosomal synapsis and genetic recombination before two meiotic divisions. in the postmeiotic phase, haploid spermatids are remodeled into spermatozoa by the processes of acrosome formation, nuclear condensation, flagellar development, and loss of the majority of cytoplasm. they are thought to play an essential role in spermatogenesis at particular stages. mammalian cell surface sialoglycoconjugates, 9-O-acetylation and de-O-acetylation play an important role in the transition of antigenicity and transformation of intercellular cross-talk. the essential role of sialic acids modification in cellular communications may explain the presently observed wide distribution of H-Lse in all examined tissues. embryonic testis contains only two distinct cell types, spermatogonia and sertoli cells. the seminiferous epithelium of adult testis consists of germ cells at different stages of spermatogensis. the 4C cells found in adult testis include the primary spermatocytes and spermatogonia of G2/M stage, while 2C cells include spermatogonia of G0/G1 stage, secondary spermatocytes, and Sert specific esterase of influenza C has been found to arrest embryo development at the two-cells stage. it has also been reported that in vitro development of embryonic stem cells shows that expression level of Lse is low at the initiation of the development, followed by an increase at later stages."}
