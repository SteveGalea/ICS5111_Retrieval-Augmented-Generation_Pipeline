{"summary": "re-emergence of pandemic influenza, H5N1 influenza, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has rekindled interest in this topic. studies have repeatedly suggested ambient humidity as an important environmental determinant in the transmission of influenza in temperate regions (21, 47, 48) high viability across 20\u201395% RH at 1 h Desalted and deproteinized suspension 1 ++ ++ Viability higher at 20\u201370% RH and lower at RH of >70% at 1 h Desalted and deproteinized suspension plus 0.1% BSA 1 Semliki Forest virus Low pH (61) ++ ++ Viability higher at 20\u201360% RH and lower at 85% RH at 24 h Desalted suspension plus 5% NaCl 1 Influenza ( viability lower at 20% RH and higher at 50% and 80% RH, but at 23 h, viability higher at 20% RH Chicken embryo prepn 18, 19 Category II Rous sarcoma virus Neutral pH (17) + ++ Viability decreased from 10\u201330% RH, was minimal at 30% RH, and then increased with increasing RH at >30%. viability at 20% and 50% RH, 89% viability at 80% RH 0.5% gelatin 19 ++ 0% viability at 20% and 50% RH, 23% viability at 80% RH 0.5% gelatin 19 ++ 0% viability at 20% and 50% RH, 23% viability at 80% RH Phosphate buffer 19 ++ 0% viability at 20% and 50% RH, 32% viability at 80% RH 0.1% cysteine 19 + ND + 1% the virus survived better than in desalted and deproteinized suspension Deproteinized and desalted suspension plus 5% NaCl 1 Feline calicivirus NA + Viability higher at RH of 30% and lower at 40\u201380% RH Eagle's medium 12 Coliphages T7 NA ++ Viability decreased with decreasing RH Clarified lysates (with salts and proteins) 1 + ++ Viability medium at 20\u201350% RH, lowest at 55\u201375% RH, highest \u201c++\u201d denotes high viability, indicating that generally over 10% viability was recovered after exposure to that RH. \u201c+\u201d denotes relatively high viability, but viability was about one order of magnitude lower than \u201c++\u201d; \u201c\u201d denotes low viability, generally 1 to 3 orders of magnitude lower than in the other two cases. vapor pressure at aerosol's surface decreases because water is lost to evaporation while solutes such as salts and proteins remain. the extent to which an aerosol evaporates depends on its solute content and RH. small droplets reach equilibrium size in less than 1 s (22, 36) poliovirus, 29% 5% versus 3.2% 1.8%) but unchanged for enveloped viruses. lipid membrane of enveloped viruses may have protected capsids from damage due to changing humidity. results showed enveloped viruses lost infectivity dramatically (up to four orders of magnitude) due to aeration, while nonenveloped ones did not. authors hypothesize enveloped viruses were likely to accumulate at the surface of droplets. salts are common components in both physiological fluids and experimental media. in aerosols subject to evaporation, salts become more concentrated as water is lost. a droplet of salt solution can lose all its water and crystallize at a lower RH unique to the salts it contains. concentrations of salts in the aerosol stay at levels close to physiological conditions, which are harmless to the viruses. evaporation is intense, and salts are concentrated enough to be toxic. solution can even become supersaturated. salts can keep the aerosol and the virus from drying out completely at RHs above the ERH and thus reduce the chance of structural rearrangements that can be damaging in the capsid of nonenveloped viruses. this effect would benefit the nonenveloped viruses that need to retain their structural water, as are enveloped viruses. a droplet of salt solution can lose all its water and crystallize at a low/medium RH unique to the salts it contains. many inorganic salts can spontaneously absorb water from the ambient air at a particular higher RH (i.e., efflorescence relative humidity [ERH]) the toxic effect of salts is supported by the finding that NaCl at concentrations in excess of 1 M leads to significant changes to membrane structure and elasticity. the third involves dry conditions (50% RH), where salts crystallize and thus their toxic effects are eliminated. salts can keep the aerosol and the virus from drying out completely at RHs above the ERH and thus reduce the chance of structural rearrangements. this effect would benefit the nonenveloped viruses that need to retain their structural water. however, some enveloped viruses have been shown to be stable at medium and high RHs. the magnitude of change in pH in an aerosol can be estimated through model calculations. a 10-m droplet composed of 2.2 g/liter of KCl and 2.2 g/liter of proteins represented as bovine serum albumin (BSA) can shrink to 0.24 of its initial diameter at 90% RH. low pH induces similar acid-catalyzed conformational changes in the viral glycoproteins for flavivirus and alphavirus. low pH induces similar acid-catalyzed conformational changes in the viral glycoproteins for flavivirus and alphavirus. an IAV mutant with an additional mutation conferring a lower fusion pH threshold was able to replicate more efficiently in ferret nasal turbinates. this effect was attributed to the mutant's improved stability of the HA protein in an acidic environment. this study indicates that pH may play an important role in the stability of viruses. at 50 to 90% RH, the aerosol generally does not dry out completely. evaporation is intense enough to lower the pH of the aerosol. the lower the pH of the aerosol and the more likely viruses are damaged. experiments using viruses with multiple entry pathways may provide an avenue to test our hypothesis. we propose a new mechanism to explain the influence of RH on viability. due to evaporation, the concentration of free H+ ions in an aerosol would increase and in turn reduce the pH. enveloped viruses have to enter host cells through fusion. it follows either direct fusion with the plasma membrane or fusion following endocytosis. others, such as IAV (25), Langat virus (a flavivirus) (52), and SFV (an alphavirus) (61), enter host cells. low RHs may induce evaporation, declines in pH, and conformational changes to surface proteins. lower RHs would thus lead to larger decreases in pH. a slight decrease in pH near the threshold that corresponds to a specific RH may tip the balance and trigger the denaturing of glycoproteins. proteins have repeatedly been shown to be protective for various enveloped viruses (1, 51, 54) changes in pH associated with droplet evaporation at a specific RH may be a mediator of virus viability. findings on RH and viability fit with our hypothesis. vaccinia virus (2, 18, 26) and pigeon pox virus (34, 60) fall into this category. sensitivity may confound the relationship with RH for viruses whose entry pathway depends on the host cell. sensitivity may confound the relationship between aerosolized viruses and RH. lead to improved prevention and control of viral infectious diseases."}
