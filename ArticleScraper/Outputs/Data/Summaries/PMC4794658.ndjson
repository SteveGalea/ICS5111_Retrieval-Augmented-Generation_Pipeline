{"summary": "theiler's murine encephalomyelitis viruses (TMEV) establish a persistent central nervous system (CNS) infection in susceptible strains of mice. autoreactive CD4+ Th1 T lymphocytes specific for myelin protein epitopes are detected in TMEV-infected mice >1 month after onset of demyelination. macrophages in spinal cords of TMEV-infected mice (8) are a major reservoir of proapoptotic BH3-only proteins Noxa and Puma bind BH multidomain antiapoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and A1 (12) this interaction alters the conformation of prosurvival proteins, e.g., Mcl-1, resulting in the release of the BH multidomain proapoptotic proteins Bak and Bax (12) the proapoptotic proteins are known to form homo-oligomers and translocate into and permeabilize the mitochondrial phosphate, 2 mM l-glutamine, 100 U of penicillin/ml, and 100 g of streptomycin/ml at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 atmosphere. cells of the immature myelomonocytic cell line M1 were induced to differentiate into macrophages with supernatants from mouse L929 fibroblasts and mouse P388D1 macrophages. 1% NP-40, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, and 10% glycerol were centrifuged at 10,000 g in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. pellets were washed and resuspended in 50 l of reducing sample buffer. the lysate was stirred for 2 h at 4\u00b0C and centrifuged in a rotor. the supernatant was layered over a 0.5-ml sucrose cushion in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6)\u20131.0 M NaCl\u20132 mM EDTA (pH 8.0)\u20131% BSA and centrifuged in an SW55 Ti rotor for 90 min at 15\u00b0C. the ratio of physical particles to infectious particles was estimated based on the virus RNA concentration determined from the optical density at 260 nm (OD260) the number of physical particles was calculated assuming that 1 mg of picornavirus RNA is equivalent to 7.2 1013 virus genomes and an equivalent number of virus particles (17). ulfonate [CHAPS], 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, buffer only, or cytosolic extracts of beAn virus-infected M1-D cells were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. a large-capacity peptide chip was used for negative-staining and transmission electron microscopy. BHK-21 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 7.5% tryptose phosphate, 2 mM l-glutamine, 100 U of penicillin/ml, and 100 g of streptomycin/ml at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. the origin and passage history of the beAn virus stock have been reported previously (14). cell lysates were disrupted in 0.4 ml of lysis buffer (20 mM Tris [pH 7.6], 1% NP-40, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, and 10% glycerol) pellets were washed and resuspended in 50 l of reducing sample buffer (1.4 M 2-mercaptoethanol, 4.6% sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS], 125 m ytopathic effect (CPE) was added to cells and supernatant to concentrations of 25 mM and 20 mM. bovine pancreatic DNase I (Sigma Chemical) was added to a concentration of 10 g/ml. the mixture was stirred for 2 h at 4\u00b0C and centrifuged in a rotor. pelleted virus from peak sucrose gradient fractions was resuspended in PBS containing 0.1% BSA. pelleted virus from peak sucrose gradient fractions was centrifuged at 45,000 rpm in an SW50.1 rotor for 20 h at 6\u00b0C. the ratio of physical particles to infectious virus was estimated based on the optical density at 260 nm (OD260) l of buffer 50 mM HEPES [pH 7.4], 50 mM NaCl, 0.1% [(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate [CHAPS], 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol, buffer only, or cytosolic extracts of beAn virus-infected M1-D cells the image was set to the CMYK color space and rendered to maximum quality using the ray function. Differences were considered significant at a P value of 0.05. RESULTS Apoptosis does not perturb early steps in the beAn virus life cycle. the significantly greater virus yields in BHK-21 cells at 8 and 12 h p.i. is likely due the 10-fold-greater area of BHK-21 cells than that of M1-D cells. similar virus protein profiles were seen after [35S]Met labeling for 10 min at 5 h p.i. and chase for the indicated times in infection of both cell types. a perturbation of capsid proteins by caspases early in infection in M1-D cells was not reflected in the assembly of protomers or pentamers. the contrast of beAn virus infections in the two cell types indicates that the induction of apoptosis in M1-D cells did not affect the early steps in the virus life cycle. capsid proteins VP0, VP1 and VP3 were present in protomers and pentamers. virions assembled at 10 to 12 h p.i. were analyzed. virions assembled at 10 to 12 h p.i. were analyzed. virions had equimolar amounts of each of the capsid proteins; VP3 migrates as a \u201cdoublet\u201d in the gels. virions had equimolar amounts of each of the capsid proteins; VP3 migrates as a \u201cdoublet\u201d in the gels. peak with apparent S value of 216 was observed at 24 h p.i. the position of this second peak was highly reproducible. the position of this second peak was highly reproducible, although it contained protomer-like structures aggregated with lipid debris. these structures had a diameter of 11.47 0.70 nm, approximating that of pentamers. patches of net hydrophobic surface charge of BeAn pentamers that are buried in assembled virions may promote aggregation of pentamers with lipid debris. in infected cells, virions that had been assembled but with incomplete cleavage of VP0 were disassembled into more hydrophobic pentamers. predicted caspase cleavage sites have >50% probability included two in VP1 and one in VP3. the predicted caspase cleavage sites are colored in white in VP1 and VP3. the images provide comparable model of the hydrophobicity of protomers assembled into pentamers. the physical particle/PFU ratio of beAn virus grown in BHK-21 cells was 3.1 103. the ratio in infected M1-D cells ranged from 1.5 103 (fractions 20 to 25) at 12 h p.i. to 0.9 103 (fractions 20 to 25) at 16 h p.i. 104 12 20\u201325 (1.20 0.32) 103 8\u201311 (1.80 0.26) 105 16 20\u201325 (0.90 0.11) 103 8\u201311 (2.10 0.26) 105 24 8\u201311 (2.56 1.60) 105 a Particle/PFU ratios of nonpeak fractions ranged from 0.4 105 to 2 105. linked Mengo virus C terminus was similarly disordered beyond residue 260 (23); however, weak density for residues 260 to 271 was later found in a refined Mengo virus structure (24) a predicted cysteine-dependent aspartate-directed protease site is likely to be present in the beAn VP1 C terminus but would give rise to only an 8-kDa product. immunoblots developed with polyclonal rabbit antibodies revealed 13- and 17-kDa bands in M1-D cells (A) but not BHK-21 cells (B) the antibody detects primarily capsid proteins; note that VP3 was faintly recognized by the antibody compared to other capsid proteins. both 13- and 17-kDa peptides but not a 20-kDa peptide were also detected in infected cells. only the 17-kDa band was significantly reduced in intensity by densitometric analysis. lysates were obtained at 15 to 20 h p.i. for SDS-PAGE and LC-MS/MS. lysates were obtained at 15 to 20 h p.i. to confirm the presence of the 13- and 17-kDa peptides in infected cells. this may explain the detection of tryptic peptides in both infected cells. caspase-3 was used in in vitro experiments at a concentration of 10 U. a fainter background band of 17 kDa was seen with buffer alone. but a similarly migrating and stronger band was seen after incubation with caspase-3. tion of infected cytosolic extracts with purified BeAn virus for 1 h at 37\u00b0C induced a modest (2-fold) decrease in the physical particle/PFU ratio (P 0.02 to not significant) incubation with 10 U of caspase-3 resulted in an 3- to 7-fold decrease in the ratio (P 0.001) this results indicate that incubation of BeAn virions with caspase-3 or with M1-D cell extracts containing at an MOI of 10, the temporal courses of cell death in both infections were similar. however, virus yields per cell at 20 h p.i. were strikingly different. onset of apoptosis in infected M1-D cells determined from cleavage of caspase-3 to its active form began at 8 to 10 h p.i. phosphorimaging of 32Pi incorporation into positive-strand virus RNA was similar in infection of both cell types. similar virus protein profiles were seen after [35S]Met labeling for 10 min at 5 h p.i. and chase for the indicated times in both cell types. cleavage of PARP and caspase-3 was not detected in BHK-21 cells. infected cells radiolabeled with [35S]Met or [3H]Leu from 4 to 5 h p.i. were centrifuged in 5 to 20% sucrose gradients. fractions were collected, immunoprecipitated with rabbit polyclonal antibodies to BeAn virions. 5S protomer and 14S pentamer peaks were identical when infected BHK-21 and M1-D cells were radiolabeled with [35S]Met and 35[S]Met-labeled virus from infected BHK-21 cells harvested at 12 and 24 h p.i. and centrifuged in 20 to 70% sucrose gradients revealed a similar 160S virion peak in fractions 10 to 14 of gradients. preliminary experiments with 35[S]Met-labeled virus in M1-D cells revealed two radioactive peaks in sucrose gradients fractionated into 24 aliquots. gradients of infected M1-D cells showed a gradual loss of the 160S virion peak between 12 and 24 h p.i. and the appearance and increasing prominence of a faster-sedimenting peak over time (results are representative of n = 3). VP0 in M1-D cells remained incompletely cleaved in assembled virions compared to infection in BHK-21 cells. EM of negatively stained 160S peak fractions in sucrose gradients from M1-D cells revealed numerous spherical 28-m virions and some empty particles typical of picornaviruses. virions that had been assembled but with incomplete cleavage of VP0 were disassembled into more hydrophobic pentamers. virions that had been assembled but with incomplete cleavage of VP0 were disassembled into more hydrophobic pentamers, enabling formation of pentamer-lipid debris aggregates in sucrose gradients. the faster-sedimenting radioactive peak from a sucrose gradient was difficult to obtain a flat field. asymmetric protomers formed by VP1, VP2 and VP3 are receptor binding sites. asymmetric protomers formed by VP1, VP2 and VP3 are shown as a triangular face within the protomer. caspase cleavage sites having >50% probability included two in VP1 and one in VP3 predicted to generate 13-, 17-, and 20-kDa peptides. ratio in infected cells ranged from 1.5 103 (fractions 20 to 25) at 11 h p.i. to 0.9 103 (fractions 20 to 25) at 16 h p.i. the faster-sedimenting peak first observed at 11 h had a physical particle/PFU ratio of 0.8 104 (fractions 8 and 9), or 6-fold less than that of the 160S peak. fractions ranged from 0.4 105 to 2 105. titers for 160S were as follows: 11 h, 2 109; 12 h, 3 109; 24 h, 2 106. a predicted cysteine-dependent aspartate-directed protease site is. beAn virus proteins in infected M1-D cells were examined in pulse-chase experiments. lower-molecular-mass peptide bands below VP3 (23-kDa) were not detected. VP3 was only faintly recognized by the polyclonal antisera raised by injecting rabbits with CsCl2-purified BeAn virus compared to VP1 and VP2. the antibody detects primarily capsid proteins; note that VP3 was faintly recognized by the antibody compared to the other capsid proteins. only faint 13- and 17-kDa bands were seen (lanes 3 to 6), but no reduction in intensity in the presence of qVD-OPh was observed. both 13- and 17-kDa peptides but not a 20-kDa peptide were also detected when virus proteins were radiolabeled in M1-D cells at 5 h p.i. only the 17-kDa band was significantly reduced in intensity by densitometric analysis. lysates were obtained at 15 to 20 h p.i. for SDS-PAGE and LC-MS/MS. tryptic peptides that mapped within the predicted two VP1 cleavage products were identified by LC-MS/MS in both M1-D and BHK-21 cells. this may explain the detection of tryptic peptides in both infected cells. however, the method used for LC-MS/MS was not quantitative 13- and 17-kDa low-intensity peptide bands were seen after incubation for 1 h with 10 U of caspase-3. a fainter background band of 17 kDa was seen with buffer alone (lane 1), but a similarly migrating and stronger band was seen after incubation with caspase-3 (lane 2). both 13- and 17-kDa bands aligned with the same lower-molecular-mass peptides from incubation of beAn virions with caspase-3 or with M1-D cell extracts reduces virus infectivity. increased physical virus particle/PFU ratio in beAn virus incubated with active recombinant caspase-3 and infected cytosol extract. apoptosis begins at 8 h p.i. based on caspase-3 cleavage to it active form. but after 10 h p.i., virions in which VP0 may have been incompletely cleaved were disassembled into protomer-like structures. predicted Asp sites in VP1 exposed on the virion surface were cleaved by caspases contemporaneously with apoptosis in association with loss noroviruses and picornaviruses are both spherical, nonenveloped viruses with icosahedral symmetry. they are composed of 60 copies each of four capsid proteins. a single copy of a capsid protein may be sufficient to render a virion noninfectious. infections by low-neurovirulence TMEV have been shown to be cell associated. EM analysis showed that unique membranous structures consisting of two membrane units enclosed a layer of virions one particle deep. virus also did not appear to be freely released upon cell lysis. but extracellular virions rather were associated with same membranous structure. capsid proteins VP1/VP2 of the parvovirus Aleutian mink disease virus induced caspase-7 activation in infected Crandell feline kidney cells. both capsid proteins are identical in sequence except that VP2 lacks the 4-kDa N-terminal sequence present in VP1 (37). the effect of caspases on nonstructural virus proteins has recently been reviewed (38)."}
