{"summary": "invasive meningococcal disease is transmitted by direct contact with large respiratory droplets or oral secretions. a surgical mask would normally provide adequate protection from large droplets, but does not prevent inhalation of smaller aerosolized particles such as those generated at autopsy. in meningitis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, septic shock, and death (1 \u20133) such cases are likely to fall under medical examiner/coroner (ME/C) jurisdiction. medical examiners/coroners and other morgue personnel may be at risk of contracting secondary disease. age was found to be the key determinant of meningococcal carriage. prevalence was 4.5% in infants with a peak of 23.7% in 19-year-olds and subsequent decrease to 7.8% in 50-year-olds (4). invasive meningococcal disease remains uncommon with historically low annual incidence. meningitidis serogroups (A, B, C, Y, W-135) each cause approximately one-third of disease cases in the united states. serogroup B accounts for proportionately more of the childhood cases (2, 3, 5, 8) 16 cases of probable laboratory-acquired meningococcal disease were identified nationwide between the years 1985-2001. the vast majority of cases (15/16; 94%) arose in clinical microbiologists manipulating isolates without respiratory protection. augmented vaccination/boosters are recommended for these special populations. meningococcal disease typically manifests as meningitis and/or meningococcemia (2, 3, 5) the interval between acquisition of organism and invasive disease is relatively short, with an average incubation period of three to four days (range: two to ten days) (3). autopsies should be performed in a facility with adequate air handling systems and by personnel wearing appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) minimal PPE includes surgical cap, impervious surgical gown with full sleeve coverage, shoe covers, mask/respirator, eye protection, and double gloves. a powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) is recommended for prosectors with facial hair. it is recommended that autopsy suites have a minimum of 12 air exchanges per hour. forensic pathologists should not require meningococcal vaccination. psy assistants meeting any of these criteria are advised to receive a booster dose of quadrivalent conjugate meningococcal vaccine (Men-ACWY) every five years (3, 5, 11, 36) the vaccine provides protection against meningococcal serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y. vaccination with a MenB conjugate vaccine is also advised; the two vaccines may be administered concurrently (9). a total of three cases of secondary meningococcal disease were identified in a 15-year span. the risk of healthcare personnel has been established to be far lower than that of household contacts. the potential antibiotic resistance resulting from such an approach would far outweigh the benefits. rifampin, ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone are contraindicated in pregnancy. chemoprophylaxis would be administered within 24 hours of the exposure. age was found to be the key determinant of meningococcal carriage. the highest rates of invasive meningococcal disease occur in children less than one year of age, followed by a second smaller peak in adolescents/young adults. serogroups B, C, and Y each cause approximately one-third of disease cases in the united states, but serogroup B accounts for proportionately more of the childhood cases. atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome and generalized myesthenia gravis may predispose to meningococcal infection. individuals with anatomic or functional asplenia are at increased risk for infection by encapsulated bacteria including N. meningitidis. augmented vaccination/boosters are recommended for these special populations. no reports of secondary transmission of meningococcal disease to healthcare personnel were found in the reviewed literature nor on additional PubMed searches. meningococcal sepsis without meningitis could be attributable to widespread use of personal protective equipment by healthcare personnel. clinical history suggestive of meningococcal sepsis would include fever, myalgia, hypotension, shock, adrenal hemorrhage, and petechial rash. other presentations of meningococcal disease are far less common, e.g. pneumonia (5-15% of cases), arthritis (2%), otitis media (1%), and epiglottitis (1%) autopsy is an aerosol-generating procedure by nature. oscillating saws, fluid aspirator hoses, and compression/dissection of lungs may all contribute to generate aerosols. CDC and OSHA suggest that utilizing respirators rather than surgical masks may be prudent in known or suspected cases of invasive meningococcal disease. autopsy suites should have a minimum of 12 air exchanges per hour. morgue laminar air flow would travel from clean to less clean areas with downdraft table ventilation to decrease personnel exposure to aerosolized pathogens. forensic pathologists should not require meningococcal vaccination. since 1972, roughly 12 cases of secondary transmission to healthcare workers have been cited in the literature. since 1972, roughly 12 cases of secondary transmission to healthcare workers have been cited in the literature. post-exposure antibiotic prophylaxis is only recommended for healthcare personnel who have:...intensive, unprotected contact with infected patients. community general practitioners prescribed 118% more chemoprophylaxis than recommended (40). chemoprophylaxis may eradicate commensal Neisseria species that help protect against colonization by pathogenic meningococci. the incidence of invasive meningococcal disease is reciprocally related to antibody titers. prosectors are advised to use fitted respirator masks instead of surgical masks as a general practice. the cost of disposable N-95 respirator masks vs. surgical masks is negligible. the aerosol-transmitted diseases against which surgical masks are deemed inadequate protection are myriad including mycobacterium tuberculosis. chemoprophylaxis can result in adverse drug reactions, increased antibiotic resistance, and eradication of nonpathogenic Neisseria species that provide cross-reactive immunity. chemoprophylaxis is advised due to the potential for large droplet or aerosol particle inhalation and subsequent infection. ideally, antibiotic prophylaxis should be initiated within 24 hours of exposure to be most efficacious (2, 3, 5, 20, 36) pre- and post-exposure preventative measures would include vaccination of those with immunocompromising conditions placing them at high risk for invasive meningococcal disease. appropriate autopsy facility design with adequate air exchange/flow, regular utilization of personal protective equipment including an N-95 respirator mask and chemoprophylaxis in the event appropriate PPE is not worn or malfunction at autopsy. autopsy suites should have a minimum of 12 air exchanges per hour. air should be exhausted outside of the facility and away from areas of high pedestrian traffic."}
