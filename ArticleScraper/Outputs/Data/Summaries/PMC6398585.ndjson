{"summary": "the frequency of such outbreaks is thought to have increased over the past decade. chikungunya virus (CHIKV) caused an extensive international epidemic in the Americas and beyond. in 2015\u20132016, the largest YF outbreak since the 1980s was observed in angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. number of disciplines, including digital disease surveillance [11], environmental modelling [12, 13], genomics [14] and mathematical modelling [15]. Attempts have been made to illustrate the spatial structure of epidemics mainly using human movement data [24\u201327], to provide mechanistic insights in how the disease may disperse locally [3, 28, 29] or how effective reactive vaccination campaigns may be [30\u201332]. e the number of introductions that lead to disease transmission in a new location [41], quantify the risk of cross-species transmission [42], and infer ecological drivers of transmission [43, 44]. a common limitation when genetic data are used is the absence of a rigorous and formal sampling scheme. in many instances, genomic sampling is affected by convenience and expedience. the global epidemic history of zika remains poorly understood. the challenge to accurately reconstruct the epidemic pathway of the virus is further complicated by its relatively unspecific clinical presentation.
