{"summary": "rTV-Fluc neutralization assay was able to detect neutralizing antibodies against Vaccinia virus without the ability to differentiate strains of Vaccinia virus. no NAbs were detected in all 222 samples from individuals born after 1980. Vaccinia Tian Tan virus (VTT) was historically used for the vaccination of millions of Chinese people during the worldwide smallpox prevention campaign. in recent years, VTT has been used as a virus vector for the development of potential vaccines for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Hepatitis B virus (HBV), Human papillomavirus (HPV), Influenza virus subtype H5N1, Aichi virus (AIV), Severe acute respiratory syndrome cor in recent years, there have been several assays developed that are high-throughput, semi-automated, and do not rely on plaque formation and manual counts. some of these assays detect aggregate cell infection as indicated by enzyme immunoassay [17] or the expression of recombinant reporter genes, such as -galactosidase (-gal) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) [19], [19]. the current study used the novel rTV-Fluc neutralization assay to study the prevalence of VTT-specific antibodies among a representative current Chinese population. results Construction of rTV-Fluc After approximately 6\u201310 rounds of purification, insertion of the Fluc into the VTT genome was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) the amplified Fluc product was identified that exactly matched the published sequence (GenBank accession: EU921841) a 24 h incubation period was sufficient to distinguish the luciferase expression of infected cells from the background level of normal cells. it was found that washing once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before the addition of the luciferin substrate did not significantly decrease the luciferase antigen expression compared with no washing. the x-axis indicates virus concentration, ranging from 0.8\u20135400 PFU/well, added to 3104 cells/well in a 96-well plate. the same experiment was carried out with rabbit sera collected before (,) and two weeks after (\u2022,) vaccination with VTT. an infectious dose of 400 PFU (MOI = 0.0133) was chosen as the optimal viral infection dose to perform the assay due to a lower coefficient of variation (P0.05). this dose was determined to be large enough to produce a high signal and thus permit the evaluation of reduction in transgene expression following neutralization. the rTV-Fluc neutralization assay was able to detect NAbs in rabbit, mouse, and human sera BALB/c mice were vaccinated twice with recombinant rTV-HIVgp 145 vaccine. at three weeks after second administration, sera were collected and analyzed using the rTV-Fluc neutralization assay. homologous and heterologous anti-VACV NAbs from various species could be detected using the developed assay. sera from two rTV-HIVgp 145-vaccinated mice and two nave mice were tested using the rTV-Fluc neutralization assay. titers of 20human and 14rTV-HIVgp145 immunized mouse sera in the Fluc assay were higher than for the PRNT assay (P = 0.12). two serum samples (V1-2 and V2-1), negative for NAb titer in PRNT, were determined to be positive by the Fluc assay. 222 sera from individuals born after 1980 were determined to be negative for anti-VTT NAb titers. the overall percentage of people with positive anti-VTT NAb (titer >30) was 7.6% in individuals born before 1980 (21/278) the percentage of positive VTT NAbs (NT50 of >30) and individuals with high titer of anti-VTT antibodies (NT50 of >100) increased with age. titers were determined using the neutralization assay described in Table 1. the assay was sensitive enough to detect even low levels of viral inhibition (NT50 of 30\u2013100), and most neutralization titers detected in 21 seropositive samples were in this range (Table 2). neutralization assay Several cell lines were compared for use in the Fluc assay with different doses of rTV-Fluc virus. the two cell lines, Vero and 143TK, produced very low background similar to the control CEF cells. it was found that 80% of 143TK cells resulted in cytopathic effect after infection for 36 h in the high dose group. therefore, the 143TK cell line was chosen for further experiments because susceptibility was less than for the x-axis indicates hours after rTV-Fluc infection, added to 10 PFU/30,000 cells (A) and 103 PFU/30,000 cells (B) in a 96-well plate. the dotted line represents the background level of three cell lines. there was a dynamic range of viral infecting dose (22\u20131800 PFU/30,000 cells) the increase in expression was linearly correlated with the increase in viral infection dose. a Vaccinia-vaccinated rabbit serum sample was determined comparing different rTV-Fluc concentrations to evaluate the optimal multiplicity of infection. a control serum with established NT titer should be included in each assay plate as a standard. incubation at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 for 1 h. nave mouse sera showed no significant neutralizing activity. rabbit serum collected at two weeks after second VTT inoculation neutralized rTV-Fluc with an NT50 of 3468. sera obtained from two humans immunized with an experimental HIV vaccinia vaccine. two months after the first survey at 15 days after immunization, anti-rMVA-HIVgpe antibody titers of 27 participants were measured again. the x-axis indicates months after immunization. the dotted line represents the detection limit of the assay. serum titers were determined by the dilution at which 50% of plaque viability or luciferase expression was observed. the y-axis indicates the serum dilution at which 50% infection inhibition was observed relative to the maximum control value. titera, num (%) Total num (%) 30 (Neg) 30\u2013100 >100 >30 (Pos) Age, years Num 18\u201330 222 222

obtained with the anti-VTT rabbit sera (ATRS) there was no statistically significant association observed between gender and the presence of antibodies against VTT (P>0.05) luciferase activity detection was more sensitive than other transgene systems. it required fewer target cells, which made it suitable for use in 384-well plates for high-throughput. the correlation between antibodies detected by the PRNT assay and those by ELISA among representatives of Japanese population. va from three different species had different levels of nonspecific inhibition effect at 130 dilution. in this assay, the samples were considered positive only when the inhibition percentage reached 50%. inhibition percentage 50% will not affect the results of detection. study investigated utility of rTV-Fluc neutralization assays in two different studies. in the first study, the assay was used to perform an epidemiological study. there were concerns that the utility of recombinant VACV vector-based vaccines could be limited by the high prevalence of pre-existing VACV NAbs in human populations. only a low prevalence of NAb to VTT (7.6%) was seen in Chinese people born before 1980, mostly at low titers. 80% of people born before 1969 and 50% of those born between 1969 and 1975 were also found to have maintained NAb against VACV. the duration of Vaccinia-specific NAbs is controversial. some studies have shown that full protective immunity conferred by smallpox vaccination lasted only 3\u20135 years. others have shown that immunity to smallpox may still be present many years after vaccination. a chemiluminescence-based neutralization assay was developed for the determination of anti-VACV NAbs titers for both human and animal sera. the assay could also be used in basic research since it gives a direct measurement of neutralizing activity. a plaque-forming assay was used to determine the titer by a plaque-forming assay using crystal violet staining and primary CEF [1]. Vaccinia virus antisera For experiments using the VTT, sera from mice and rabbits vaccinated with VTT and control normal mouse and rabbit sera were used. s was from pLUCF (kindly provided by John T.
