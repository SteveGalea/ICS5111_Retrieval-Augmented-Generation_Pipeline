{"summary": "patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) developing acute respiratory failure require invasive mechanical ventilation. protracted ventilation may pose the risk of complications such as sinusitis,[3] respiratory muscle weakness, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. previous studies indicated that noninvasive ventilation used at this timing significantly reduced duration of invasive ventilation, VAP, and hospital death for AECOPD patients with ARF. but recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) [13\u201315] found no significant differences on mortality, weaning failures, or reintubation rates between patients receiving noninvasive ventilation. systematic review was conducted using the Cochrane Collaboration's approach[20] and was reported complied with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist[21] Criteria for considering studies for this review 2.1.1. Type of studies Only RCTs, which were published or unpublished in English or Chinese, were identified for this review. a panel of 12 clinicians from west china hospital were investigated to identify possible outcomes relating to invasive ventilation and noninvasive ventilation. the results were then used to generate a mean score with standard deviation (SD) for each outcome. three outcome categories were identified based on the clinical importance. data extraction and management Predeveloped forms were used to extract following data from each identified study by 2 independent investigators. Discrepancies were resolved via discussion or in consultation with the lead reviewer (D-YK) terogeneity across study results was assessed using Cochrane's Q statistic with P value. if P 0.1 or I2 > 50%, indicating significant heterogeneity was present, a random-effects model was applied to pool overall effect estimate; otherwise, a fixed-effects model was used. patients complicated with pulmonary encephalopathy, pulmonary infarction, allergic rhinitis, bronchial asthma, active tuberculosis, and pneumoconiosis were excluded. any type of noninvasive ventilation delivered by a nasal/oronasal cannula, or full face mask providing ventilatory support from a flow generator, was identified. Types of participants Participants (age 18 years old, male/female) who were diagnosed with AECOPD mainly caused by pulmonary infection and who met the indications for using mechanical ventilation were included in this study. three outcome categories were identified based on the clinical importance. critical (mean score of 7\u20139), important but not critical (mean score of 4\u20136) and limited importance (mean score of 1\u20133). studies were screened independently by 2 review authors (LP and X-TL) using EndNote 5.0 software after removal of duplications. Discrepancies resolved via discussion or in consultation with the lead reviewer (D-YK) pooled effect estimate was calculated using risk ratio (RR) with its 95% confidence interval (CI) overall treatment effect size was calculated using mean difference (MD) with its 95% confidence interval (CI) a 2-sided P 0.05 was considered as the threshold for statistical significance. a total of 17 studies[30\u201346] from electronic databases were included in this review. a total of 17 studies[30\u201346] were included in this review. Mortality Sixteen studies including 849 patients reported mortality. pooled estimate indicated noninvasive ventilation reduced mortality significantly without significant heterogeneity. there were 13 trials comparing the duration of invasive ventilation between 2 groups. a significant reduction of the duration of invasive ventilation was observed. data from 9 studies that reported LOS in hospital were pooled. compared with invasive ventilation, noninvasive ventilation significantly reduced hospital stay of 6 days with considerable heterogeneity. 3.8. evidence synthesis by using GRADE Quality assessment and evidence syntheses by using the GRADE approach were shown in Table 3. the quality of evidence regarding the 9 critical or important outcomes was downgraded to moderate or low because of different limitations. all eligible studies were carried out in china and were published in Chinese. male approximately accounted for half of the total patients in each study. no dropouts were observed in these studies. pooled estimate indicated that noninvasive ventilation reduced mortality significantly (RR = 0.27, 95% CI: 0.17\u20130.42, P 0.001) without significant heterogeneity. a significant reduction on the incidence of VAP was observed in groups of noninvasive ventilation. Mortality Sixteen studies including 849 patients reported mortality. noninvasive ventilation reduced mortality significantly without significant heterogeneity (I2 = 0%, P = 0.99). there were 13 trials comparing the duration of invasive ventilation between 2 groups. a significant reduction of the duration of invasive ventilation was observed. 9 studies that reported LOS in hospital were pooled. noninvasive ventilation significantly reduced hospital stay of 6 days. there were 13 trials comparing the duration of invasive ventilation between 2 groups. data from 9 studies that reported LOS in hospital were pooled. noninvasive ventilation significantly reduced hospital stay of 6 days. there were 6 studies enrolling 276 participants comparing hospital costs between 2 groups. 3.7. Publication bias A funnel plot for the outcome VAP via visual inspection presented significant asymmetry, indicating the potential risk of publication bias. the quality of evidence regarding the 9 critical or important outcomes was downgraded to moderate or low because of different limitations. CI excluded a relative risk of 1.0 and did not include appreciable benefit or harm. the total number of patients of this meta-analysis failed to meet the optimal information size (OIS) criterion, which was estimated at approximately 398. publication bias was detected from the funnel plot of the outcome VAP. we rated down the evidence quality for this outcome. noninvasive ventilation is positively related to VAP. all trials included in this review selected PIC window as switch point. pulmonary infection is the main cause of acute exacerbations of COPD in china. the quality of evidence was influenced by heterogeneity in the outcomes of duration of invasive ventilation, total duration of mechanical ventilation, LOS in ICU, LOS in hospital, and hospital costs. inconsistencies relating to patients\u2019 clinical characteristics during the treatment were the reasons for downgrading one level of the evidence. quality of evidence with respect to the 9 critical or important outcomes was graded from moderate to low. uncertainty of long-term effects was more likely to warrant a weak recommendation of noninvasive ventilation used at PIC window for ARF in AECOPD patients. one study[37] included only 25 participants; we doubted whether the small sample size was enough to achieve an adequate statistical power to detect the differences between noninvasive ventilation group and invasive ventilation group. our included trials were conducted in china. noninvasive ventilation at PIC window could significantly reduce mortality, VAP, weaning failures, reintubations, duration of invasive ventilation, total duration of mechanical ventilation, LOS in ICU, and LOS in hospital as well as hospital costs. all trials included in this review selected PIC window as switch point. pulmonary infection is the main cause of acute exacerbations of COPD in china. the quality of evidence was influenced by heterogeneity in the outcomes of duration of invasive ventilation, total duration of mechanical ventilation, LOS in ICU, LOS in hospital, and hospital costs. if the total number of participants of a meta-analysis is lower than the OIS, the quality of evidence should be downgraded because of imprecision. the quality of evidence with respect to the 9 critical or important outcomes was graded from moderate to low. uncertainty of long-term effects was more likely to warrant a weak recommendation of noninvasive ventilation used at PIC window for ARF in AECOPD patients. one study[37] included only 25 participants; we doubted whether the small sample size was enough to achieve an adequate statistical power to detect the differences between noninvasive ventilation group and invasive ventilation group. 80% to 90% of COPD patients are caused by pulmonary infection in china. Implications for practice Current evidence syntheses from 17 identified trials suggested noninvasive ventilation used at PIC window significantly reduced mortality, VAP, weaning failures, reintubations, duration of invasive ventilation, total duration of mechanical ventilation, LOS in ICU, and LOS in hospital as well as hospital costs. if consideration is taken to adopt PIC window for extubation, we suggest it be performed prior by well-trained and highly experienced treatment providers. all identified studies were carried out in china, further rigorously designed and large-scale RCTs outside of china are warranted to improve the generalizability and applicability of this study results."}
