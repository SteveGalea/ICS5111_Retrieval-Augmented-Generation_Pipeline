{"summary": "drug addiction is a chronic, relapsing neuropsychiatric disease manifested by uncontrolled drug-seeking and drug-taking. it can be comprehended as a neuropathological process caused by drug stimulation, results in the construction of obsessive drug-seeking behaviour. c-fos protein took part in the neurobiological responses to morphine in dopamine neurons. both ERK and PKC pathways have been found to participate in the morphine-mediated drug addiction. ampal neuronal HT22 cells were grown in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium-high glucose (DMEM-HG, D5796, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) HT22 cells were exposed to 10 M morphine for 24 h in our experiments. Western blotting Total proteins were separated from HT22 cells with the help of Cell Lysis Buffers. proteins were electrophoresed on polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. the signals of proteins were recorded and the intensities of bands were calculated. p-Values were calculated via Student\u2019s t-test or ANOVA. mouse hippocampal neuronal HT22 cells were received from Procell Life Science & Technology Co., Ltd. total RNAs were separated by RNAiso Plus (9108, Takara Biomedical Technology, Beijing, China) the cDNA was synthesized with the help of PrimeScript cDNA Synthesis kit (6210, Takara Biomedical Technology) the expression was measured by TaqMan Non-coding RNA assay (4426961, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) anti-Beclin-1 antibody (sc-48341), anti-LC3 antibody (sc-271625) and anti-actin antibody (sc-47778) were all purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. PVDF membrane was incubated with primary antibodies for 12 h at 4 \u00b0C. morphine elevated p/t-ERK and p/t-PKC expression rates in HT22 cells. HT22 cells were exposed to 10 M morphine for 24 h. protein levels of OX1R (A), c-fos (B), t-ERK, p-ERK, t-PKC and p-PKC were tested by western blotting. HT22 cells were exposed to 10 M morphine for 24 h. the MEG3 expression in HT22 cells was significantly declined by si-MEG3 transfection. morphine-caused elevation of p/t-ERK expression in HT22 cells was notably weakened by si-MEG3 transfection. p/t-PKC expression in HT22 cells was not changed between transfection with si-NC and transfection with si-MEG3. the protein levels of OX1R (A), c-fos (B), t-ERK, p-ERK, t-PKC and p-PKC in HT22 cells were tested by western blotting. the silence of MEG3 suppressed HT22 cell autophagy through inactivating ERK pathway. HT22 cells were exposed to 10 M morphine for 24 h. the protein levels of OX1R (A), c-fos, p/t-ERK and p/t-PKC were tested. 10 M morphine exposure significantly elevated the Beclin-1 protein level and LC3-II/LC3-I expression rate in HT22 cells. morphine promoted HT22 cell autophagy. HT22 cells were exposed to 10 M morphine for 24 h. the beclin-1 protein level and LC3-II/LC3-I expression rate in HT22 cells were both lowered in morphine + si-MEG3 group. the results showed that up-regulation of MEG3 attended to the influence of morphine on HT22 cell autophagy. p/t-ERK expression in HT22 cells was not changed between transfection with si-NC and transfection with si-MEG3. up-regulation of MEG3 also took part in the influences of morphine on c-fos and p/t-ERK expressions in HT22 cells. the silence of MEG3 suppressed HT22 cell autophagy through inactivating ERK pathway. followed by 10 M morphine treatment and/or si-MEG3 transfection. the beclin-1 and LC3 protein levels in HT22 cells were tested by western blotting. morphine is one of the most abundant alkaloids isolated from the poppy plants. the addiction of morphine also is a very serious social issue. many efforts have been made to explore the molecular basis of morphine addiction. morphine-stimulated HT22 cells were all increased after morphine stimulation. the LC3-II/LC3-I and Beclin-1 expressions were also elevated in HT22 cells after morphine stimulation. previous studies reported that the expression of several lncRNAs were changed in the brain of addicted humans. findings suggest that up-regulation of MEG3 attended to morphine-caused autophagy of HT22 cells might be achieved by elevating c-fos expression and promoting ERK pathway activation. more experiments are also needed in the future to analyse the influence of other lncRNAs in drug addiction."}
