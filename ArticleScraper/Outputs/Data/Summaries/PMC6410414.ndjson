{"summary": "introduction Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first reported in humans in 2012. dromedary camels are a likely natural reservoir of this virus. mers-CoV is an emerging infectious coronavirus. anti-MERS-CoV therapeutic antibodies with strong stability and simplified structures would be clinically valuable. camelid heavy chain variable domains (VHHs) are derived from the variable domains of the camelid heavy chain-only antibodies. these antibodies have distinctive properties, including high binding affinity, strong specificity for target antigens. oligomeric Nbs have been significantly improved from the standpoint of binding affinity to the RBD, inhibition of the RBD-DPP4 binding, and cross-neutralize MERS-CoV infection. oligomeric Nbs have been significantly improved from the standpoint of binding affinity to the RBD, inhibition of the RBD-DPP4 binding, and cross-neutralizing activity. ELISA plates were coated overnight at 4 \u00b0C with recombinant wild-type or mutant MERS-CoV RBDs containing a C-terminal human Fc tag. membranes were blocked overnight at 4 \u00b0C with PBST containing 5% non-fat milk. the reactions were stopped with 1 N H2SO4. at 450 nm (A450) was measured by ELISA microplate reader (Tecan, Morrisville, NC, USA) to compare binding activity, the median effective concentration (EC50) was calculated as previously described. recombinant Fc-fused MERS-CoV RBD protein (5 g/mL) was captured on a sensor chip protein A (GE Healthcare) MERS-CoV was incubated with Nbs at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. the cytopathic effect was observed daily. the neutralizing activity of the Nbs was reported as 50% neutralization dose (ND50) stability of Nbs in the presence of chaotropic denaturants was evaluated by incubation in PBS containing a gradient of concentrations of urea (Sigma) for 24 h at 25 \u00b0C [49,50] the thermal stability of Nbs was evaluated by incubation in 10 mM HCl buffer (pH 2.0) containing various concentrations of pepsin (Sigma) for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. the recombinant Nbs were expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115 cells. they were purified using Ni-NTA columns (GE Healthcare, Cincinnati, OH, USA) the membranes were further blocked overnight at 4 \u00b0C with PBST containing 5% non-fat milk. \u00b0C with serially diluted Nbs, goat anti-llama antibody (1:5000, Abcam) and HRP-conjugated anti-goat IgG antibody (1:3000, Abcam) the reactions were stopped with 1 N H2SO4. absorbance at 450 nm (A450) was measured by ELISA microplate reader. the cells were incubated for 30 min with FITC-labeled anti-human antibody (1:50, Sigma) and then analyzed by flow cytometry. percentage inhibition was calculated based on the fluorescence intensity of RBD\u2013Huh-7 binding in the presence vs. absence of Nbs. after 72 h, the cells were lysed in cell lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), incubated with luciferase substrate (Promega), and assayed for relative luciferase activity by Tecan Infinite 200 PRO Luminator (Tecan) the ND50 of Nbs was calculated as previously described. the antigen-binding fragments of camelid HcAbs are also called VHHs. previously, using PCR to amplify the MERS-CoV RBD-specific VHH gene, we constructed a Mono-Nb targeting the MERS-CoV RBD. we linked this construct to a C-terminal His6 tag for easy purification. b was constructed by linking a MERS-CoV receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific VHH and a C-terminal His6 tag. dimeric Nb (Di-Nb) and trimeric Nb (Tri-Nb) were constructed by linking two or three Mono-Nbs with GGGGS linkers and a C-terminal His6 tag for easy purification. the binding affinity of the MERS mAb control was similar to that of Mono-Nb, whereas the binding of the SARS mAb control was indistinguishable from background. we then performed a SPR assay to test the binding affinity of these Nbs for RBD-WT. mERS-CoV RBD-targeting Mono-Nb was used for comparison. both Di-Nb and Tri-Nb potently neutralized MERS-CoV infection with a significantly lower ND50 than Mono-Nb. both di-Nb and Tri-Nb blocked the binding of MERS-CoV RBD to hDPP4 more strongly than Mono-Nb. neutralizing activity of the Nbs is expressed as the Nb concentration (nM) that completely inhibited the cytopathic effect (CPE) of MERS-CoV in at least 50% of the wells. significant differences between groups were compared by ND50 s.e.m. (A) or median inhibitory concentration (IC50) s.e.m. (A,C) significant differences between Di-Nb and Mono-Nb are shown as red asterisk, and those between Tri-Nb and Mono-Nb are shown as green asterisk (** and ***) treated or not treated at the three pH values, maintained similar neutralizing activity against pseudotyped MERS-CoV infection. the SARS mAb control had no cross-neutralizing activity against MERS-CoV after any of these treatments. Nbs were treated at different pH values (pH 5.0, 7.0, and 8.0) for 24 h at room temperature. indicated concentrations of pepsin for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C or urea for 24 h at 25 \u00b0C. different temperatures (4 \u00b0C, 37 \u00b0C, and 60 \u00b0C) ND50 ranged from 0.81 to 27.1 nM for Mono-Nb, from 0.07 to 3.29 nM for Di-Nb, and from 0.01 to 0.61 nM for Tri-Nb. the neutralizing activity of MERS mAb was much lower than that of Di-Nb and Tri-Nb against all MERS-CoV strains tested.

ELISA for binding between mono-Nb or Tri-Nb and RBD wild-type (RBD-WT) protein of the EMC2012 strain and mutant proteins containing RBD mutations from human and camel in 2012, 2013, 2014, and ERS-CoV RBD-specific mAb (MERS mAb) and SARS-CoV RBD-specific mAb (SARS mAb) were included as controls. data are presented as mean A450 standard error (n = 2). Di-Nb and Tri-Nb blocked binding of MERS-CoV RBD (i.e., RBD-WT) to hDPP4 more strongly than Mono-Nb. inhibition was dose-dependent. data are presented as mean percentage inhibition s.e.m. (n = 2). Percentage inhibition is expressed as RBD\u2013Huh-7 binding in the presence or absence of Nbs. all Nbs, including Mono-Nb, Di-Nb, and Tri-Nb, were still able to neutralize pseudotyped MERS-CoV infection after treatment at three different pH values. all samples maintained neutralizing activity similar to their respective untreated counterparts. the SARS mAb control had no cross-neutralizing activity against MERS-CoV infection.
