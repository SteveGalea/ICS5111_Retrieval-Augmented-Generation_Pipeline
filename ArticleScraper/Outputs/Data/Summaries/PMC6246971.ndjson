{"summary": "web-based behavior is monitored and analyzed in order to examine actual human behavior so as to predict, better assess, and even prevent health-related issues that constantly arise in everyday life. 109 published papers were extracted, excluding duplicates and those that did not fall within the topics of health and medicine or the selected article types. the analysis of online search queries has been of notable popularity in the field of big data analytics in academic research [8,9] the most popular tool for analyzing behavior using Web-based data is Google Trends [11] data are downloaded from the Web in \u201c.csv\u201d format. each data point is divided by the total searches of the geography and time range it represents. places with the most search volume would always be ranked highest. new methods of assessing Google health data are constantly arising. up to this point, several topics have been examined, such as epilepsy [39,40], cancer [41], thrombosis [42], silicosis [43], and various medical procedures including cancer screening examination [44,45], bariatric surgery [46], and laser eye surgery [47]. another trend rising is the measurement of the change in interest in controversial issues [48,49] and in drug-related subjects. data can be related to the seasonality of actual cases of the respective diseases searched for. a correlation between the percentage change in the global revenues in Lipitor statin for dyslipidemia treatment and Google searches. the detection and monitoring of flu has been of notable popularity in health assessment. in 2014, Nuti et al published a systematic review of Google Trends research. it includes 3 more full years of Google Trends research, that is, 2014, 2015, and 2016, which account for the vast majority of the research conducted in this field based on our selection criteria. the search returned 102 publications. 109 studies were included in this review. 5 studies were written in a language other than English. region Refers to the language in which the Google Trends search was conducted (eg, search for the Italian word Si) Keywords Basic keywords are included in this category, mostly referring to the health topic examined. Seasonality (C) Studies that have examined correlations are included in this category. only 8.7% (9/104) studies used Google Trends data for predictions and forecasting. 23.1% (24/104) used them for examining seasonality. correlations and modeling were performed in 39.4% (41/104) and 32.7% (34/104) studies. Table 2 shows the methods used to explore seasonality. Tables 3 and 4 present the methods used to examine correlations and perform predictions and forecasting. Seasonality explained the searches significantly better with an F-test 15 Phelan et al, 2016 [133] Correlograms (autocorrelations plots) Visual interpretation for exploring seasonal peaks 16 Plante and Ingram, 2014 [134] Cosinor analysis To test the seasonal variation of the normalized Google Trends data 17 Rossignol et al, 2013 [67] Mann-Whitney U test.
