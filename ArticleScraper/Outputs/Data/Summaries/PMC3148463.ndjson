{"summary": "pulmonary histopathology was categorized as diffuse alveolar damage, pulmonary edema, alveolar hemorrhage, and lymphoplasmacytic interstitial pneumonia. pulmonary histopathology was categorized as diffuse alveolar damage, pulmonary edema, alveolar hemorrhage, and lymphoplasmacytic interstitial pneumonia. Acute respiratory failure is a major cause of death in patients with a variety of primary underlying diseases. prevalences of comorbidities and mortality have been reported to be higher than 40-50% in patients with a variety of primary underlying diseases. we excluded patients younger than one year of age and individuals not diagnosed with ARF. we also obtained data regarding each patient's age, sex, and major underlying associated diseases (as determined at autopsy) bacterial bronchopneumonia (BBP) was defined as the presence of cell consolidation with polymorphonuclear leukocyte accumulation in bronchioles and adjacent alveoli. sepsis and septic shock were defined as sepsis with the addition of organ dysfunction or the clinical diagnosis of arterial hypotension. ocardial infarction, systemic arterial hypertension, dilated cardiomyopathy, pulmonary embolism, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, sepsis and septic shock, chronic kidney failure, and tuberculosis. from 1990 to 2008, 26,560 medical autopsies were performed at a tertiary health care center. olar collapse, hyaline membranes, obliterative fibrosis, neo-septal formation, and moderately organizing fibrosis. bronchopneumonia (BBP) was defined as presence of cell consolidation with polymorphonuclear leukocytes. bronchopneumonia (BBP) was defined as presence of cell consolidation with polymorphonuclear leukocytes. sepsis and septic shock were defined as sepsis with the addition of organ dysfunction or the clinical diagnosis of arterial hypotension. the diagnoses of mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and atypical mycobacterial infection were confirmed using fluorescence, the Ziehl-Neelsen techniques and a lowenstein-Jensen culture. the only inclusion criterion for the definition of ARF was based on arterial blood gases (PaO260 mmHg or PaCO2>50 mmHg with pH7.30) we excluded patients younger than one year of age and individuals not diagnosed with ARF. all the lungs were analyzed by microscopy, even when the medical records indicated the patient's diagnosis. the lungs were fixed in 10% formalin prepared in 0.9% saline for at least four weeks. we studied a total of five sections per lung for a total of 10 sections per person. the independent variables included major diseases and/or comorbidities. BBP, cancer, liver cirrhosis, HIV/AIDS, acute myocardial infarction, systemic arterial hypertension, dilated cardiomyopathy, pulmonary embolism, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, sepsis and septic shock, chronic kidney failure, and tuberculosis. the pulmonary histopathological findings and the most prevalent diseases in the 4,710 patients are shown in Table 2. Table 2. The etiological diagnoses observed in the autopsies of the acute respiratory failure patients, along with the main pulmonary histopathological findings. BBP was present in 33.9% of the patients (1,597 cases) and was the most frequent pulmonary complication found at the time of autopsy. cancer was the second most frequent complication; it was observed in 28.1% of the patients (1,324 cases) 11 Severe sepsis and/or septic shock 2.67 0.001 2.24\u20133.20 2.29 0.001 1.77\u20132.96 1.19 NS 0.89 \u2013 1.58 1.5 NS 0.95\u20132.37 Liver cirrhosis 2.24 0.001 1.86\u20132.70 1.69 0.001 1.33\u20132.14 1.06 NS 0.79 \u2013 1.42 2.01 0.02 1.14\u20133.55 Cancer 1.09 NS 0.94\u20131.26 1.27 0.00 autopsy studies have shown important differences between autopsy findings and the antemortem clinical diagnoses. despite recent technological diagnostic advances, the autopsy remains an important complementary tool for identifying and understanding diseases. patients who developed ARF had underlying diseases such as BBP (33.9%), cancer (28.1%), sepsis and septic shock (14.3%), liver cirrhosis (13.6%), HIV/AIDS (10.4%), pulmonary embolism (9.0%), acute myocardial infarction (4.7%), brain stroke (4.4%), chronic kidney failure (4.4%), diabetes mellitus (4.1%). cancer was the second most important complication diagnosis in our study. it was present in 28.1% of the autopsies; it was present in 28.1% of the autopsies. this incidence rate was higher than that observed in other studies. the underdiagnosis of pulmonary embolism has been a significant problem in critical care units until recently. pulmonary embolism and acute myocardial infarction were significantly associated with ARF. one group has described pulmonary embolisms in 5% of patients who died from ARF. two other groups have reported pulmonary embolisms in 14% and 20% of the patients who died from ARF. LPIP showed an important association and was the most specific pattern in the HIV/AIDS patients. autopsy findings depend on the interest and skill of the pathologist. despite advances in diagnostic technology, the autopsy has remained an important complementary tool for identifying and understanding diseases."}
