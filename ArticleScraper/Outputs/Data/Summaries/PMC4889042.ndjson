{"summary": "CoVs are enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses with large genomes of approximately 27\u201332 kb. the 5\u2019 two-thirds of the genome encode a polyprotein that is post-translationally processed to yield all proteins required for RNA replication (non-structural proteins) the 3\u2019 one-third of the genome encodes a canonical set of four structural proteins: spike (S), envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid. MERS-CoV causes pneumonia and renal failure, with a mortality rate exceeding 30%. the remaining four low-pathogenic (LP) HCoVs, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63 (Alphacoronaviruses), HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1 (Betacoronaviruses) have been shown to circulate worldwide. there are no effective drugs available to treat infection with HCoV DSs are expressed as the fraction of NH2 groups substituted within the chitosan chain. the previously described DS of a DS of 63% (here marked as HTCC-63) demonstrated an inhibitory effect not only on HCoV-NL63, but also on HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1. human MRC-5 cells (ATCC: CCL-244) were maintained in RPMI-1640 (Life Technologies, Poland) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Poland), penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 g/ml) and ciprofloxacin (5 g/ml) cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C under 5% CO2. 2.5 g of chitosan (molecular weight 250 100 kDa, degree of deacetylation (DD) 83%) was dispersed in a mixture of 100 ml distilled water and 10 ml acetic acid. the solution was stirred for 30 min and varying volumes (5\u20138 ml) of glycidyltrimethylammonium chloride were added to obtain the polymer with different DS values varying between 50 and 80% cells were then lysed by two freeze-thaw cycles at day 6 post-infection (p.i.) each virus yield was assessed by titration on fully confluent LLC-Mk2, HCT-8 or MRC-5 cells in 96-well plates. cytopathic effect (CPE) was scored by observation under an inverted microscope. oV-NL63 nucleocapsid protein was aliquoted and stored at 80\u00b0C. fully confluent cells in 96-well plates were exposed to HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E or HCoV-NL63. after 2 h incubation, unbound virions were removed by washing with 100 l of 1 PBS. cell viability assay LLC-Mk2, MRC-5 and HCT-8 cells were cultured on 96-well plates. on the day of the assay the medium was removed and 100 l of the culture medium with 30 l of the activated XTT solution was added to each well. after 2 h incubation at 37\u00b0C, the medium was transferred onto a new 96-well plate and signal was measured at = 490 nm. l was amplified in a 10 l reaction mixture containing 1 TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Life Technologies, Poland), specific probes labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) and 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) and primers (450 nM each) Rox was used as the reference dye. samples were serially diluted and used as an input for reverse transcription and real-time PCR reaction. target species Primer Primer sequence (5\u2019 3\u2019) HCoV-OC43 Sense (OC43F_rt) AGCAACCAGGCTGATGTCAATACC Antisense (OC43R_rt) cells were washed with sterile PBS, fixed with 3% PFA, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 1 PBS and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with 1 PBS supplemented with 10% BSA and 0.5% Tween 20. cells were then washed, re-suspended in 1 PBS and analyzed with FACS Calibur (Becton Dickinson) for ACE2 staining, cells were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with goat anti-ACE2 ectodomain IgG (4 g/ml; R&D Systems, USA), followed by a 1 h incubation with Alexa Fluor 546-labeled donkey anti-goat IgG (2.5 g/ml, Life Technologies, Poland). nuclear DNA was stained with DAPI (0.1 g/ml, Sigma-Aldrich human MRC-5 cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 (Life Technologies, Poland) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Poland), penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 g/ml) and ciprofloxacin (5 g/ml). human tracheobronchial epithelial cells were obtained from airway specimens resected from patients undergoing surgery. 2.5 g of chitosan was dispersed in a mixture of 100 ml distilled water and 10 ml acetic acid. the solution was stirred for 30 min and varying volumes (5\u20138 ml) of glycidyltrimethylammonium chloride were added to obtain the polymer. the suspension was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min to remove suspended unreacted chitosan. the HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E stocks were generated by infecting monolayers of HCT-8 and MRC-5 cells. cells were then lysed by two freeze-thaw cycles at day 6 post-infection (p.i.) each virus yield was assessed by titration on fully confluent LLC-Mk2, HCT-8 and MRC-5 cells in 96-well plates. the virus-containing fractions were aliquoted and stored at 80\u00b0C. the control cell lysate (mock) was concentrated and prepared in the same manner as the virus stock. each day p.i., 100 l of 1 PBS was applied at the apical surface of HAE. all samples were stored at 80\u00b0C and analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. cell viability assay was performed by using the XTT Cell Viability Assay. quantitative RT-PCR Virus yields were determined using real-time PCR (7500 Fast Real-Time PCR machine; Life Technologies, Poland) cDNA was amplified in a 10 l reaction mixture containing 1 TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Life Technologies, Poland), specific probes labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) and 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) the number of RNA copies/ml was assessed using a spectrophotometer. samples were serially diluted and used as an input for reverse transcription and real-time PCR reaction. odixanol-concentrated HCoV-NL63 or mock samples in the presence of the HTCC-63 (200 g/ml) or control 1 PBS for 2 h at 4\u00b0C. cells were then washed with 1 PBS, fixed with 3% PFA, permeabilized with 0,1% Triton X100 in 1 PBS and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with 1 PBS supplemented with 10% BSA and 0.5% Tween 20 cells were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with mouse anti-HCoV-NL63-N IgG (0.25 g/ml; Ingenansa, Spain), followed by a 1 h incubation with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (2.5 g/ml, Life Technologies, Poland). for ACE2 staining, cells were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with goat anti-ACE2 we analyzed the influence of the previously described HTCC-63 polymer on different steps of HCoV-NL63 replication cycle. to achieve this, concentrated virus stock was incubated with the polymer (200 g/ml) or control 1 PBS at room temperature for 2 h. titers were evaluated on day 5 p.i. [11]. LLC-Mk2 cells were pre-cooled and incubated with HCoV-NL63 (TCID50 of 400) at 4\u00b0C for 1 h in the presence of the unbound virus or control PBS. cells were rinsed 3 times with ice cold 1 PBS. cytopathic effect (CPE) and quantitative RT-PCR. cells were incubated with gradient-purified HCoV-NL63 in the presence of control PBS or HTCC-63 at 200 g/ml (Virus+HTCC) or mock. HCoV-NL63 interaction with the ACE2 protein was analyzed with confocal microscopy. cells were incubated with the HTCC-63 (50\u2013200 g/ml) or control medium at 32\u00b0C for 2 h. cells were washed 3 times with acidic buffer (0.1 M glycine, 0.1 M NaCl, pH 3.0) in order to inhibit the fusogenic activity of virions that were not internalized. HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, or HCoV-HKU1 replication in human airway epithelium (HAE) cultures were exposed to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, or HCoV-HKU1 in the presence of HTCC-63 (200 g/ml) or control PBS. l of 1 PBS was applied to the apical surface of HAE cultures and collected after 10 min of incubation at 32\u00b0C. the data are presented as Log Removal Value (LRV) compared to the untreated sample. 1 infection was investigated using the ex vivo HAE model. cells seeded in monolayer on 96-well plates were infected with a respective CoV at a TCID50 of 400 in the presence of HTCCs with various DS (200 g/ml each) MRC-5 cells were infected with HCoV-229E and HCT-8 cells were infected with HCoV-OC43. HAE cultures were infected with HCoV-HKU1 in the presence of HTCCs with DS ranging from 57% to 77% at 200 g/ml or control medium. yield was observed in samples supplemented with HTCC-62 or HTCC-77 compared to the control. XTT assays were performed for each experimental setting. HCoV-NL63 infection was effectively inhibited by HTCC-63 and HTCC-65. fected with HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 were evaluated using quantitative RT-PCR on day 6 post-infection. data are presented as Log Removal Value (LRV) compared to untreated samples. the assay was performed in triplicate, and average values with standard errors are presented. adherence of HCoV-NL63 particles was not inhibited in the presence of HTCC-63. the polymer does not hamper virus binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPs) we analyzed virus co-localization with the receptor in the presence of the functional receptor (ACE2) [14]. HCoV-NL63 interaction with the ACE2 protein was analyzed with confocal microscopy. cells were inoculated with ice-cold HCoV-NL63 at TCID50 of 400. incubated at 4\u00b0C for 2 h to allow virus binding, but not internalization. then, virus particles were removed by washing with ice-cold 1 PBS. cells were washed 3 times with acidic buffer in order to inhibit the fusogenic activity of virions that were not internalized. pre-cooled LLC-Mk2 cells were incubated with cold HCoV-NL63 at 4\u00b0C, followed by incubation with HTCC (50\u2013200 g/ml) or control PBS for 2 h at 32\u00b0C. unbound virus was removed by washing with acidic buffer and cells were further incubated at 32\u00b0C for 5 days. HTCC-63 inhibits HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1 replication in human airway epithelium (HAE) cultures. each day post infection, 100 l of 1 PBS was applied to the apical surface of HAE cultures. three out of the four experiments were performed in vitro using the following permissive cell lines: LLC-Mk2 (for HCoV-NL63), MRC-5 (for HCoV-229E), and HCT-8 (for HCoV-OC43). the antiviral effect of the HTCC polymers against HCoV-HKU1 infection was investigated using the ex vivo HAE model. no inhibition of HCoV-229E infection was observed for HTCC-57, HTCC-63, or HTCC-65. MRC-5 cells were infected with HCoV-NL63 in the presence of HTCCs with DS ranging from 57% to 77% at a concentration of 200 g/ml or control medium. a 3\u20134 log decrease in the HCoV-HKU1 yield was observed in samples supplemented with HTCC-62 or HTCC-77 compared to the control. a combination of HTCCs with different DS exhibits broad anticoronaviral activity. the results of in vitro study using LLC-Mk2 and MRC-5 cell lines showed a significant decrease in HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E virus yields. MRC-5 and LLC-Mk2 cells were infected with HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63, respectively, in the presence of the HTCC-62/63 or HTCC-63/77 mixtures. chitosan has antibacterial activity against Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Streptococcus mutans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. a thorough analysis revealed that the polymer does not affect virus attachment to target cells via HSPs, but effectively blocks subsequent interaction with the receptor. HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 belong to the betacoronavirus genus. inhibition of each virus requires an HTCC with an optimal DS. chitosan and chitosan-based polymers are not toxic in vivo. respiratory infection is in fact a polymer (iota-carrageenan) [30\u201332] this polymer is not effective against CoVs. the development of HTCC-based therapeutics may offer a solution."}
