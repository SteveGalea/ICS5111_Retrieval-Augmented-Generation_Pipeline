{"summary": "in 2003-2004, severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) emerged from CoVs circulating between bats, civets, and raccoon dogs. the virus host-interactions that regulate disease severity remain poorly understood. the presence of CoV precursors in animal reservoirs highlights the possibility of future emergent epidemic strains. 2\u2032-O methylation has been shown to be important in a variety of mRNA processing aspect. but the role of 2\u2032-O methylation had been unclear. viruses can subvert host recognition of their mRNA and fail to induce a strong cell intrinsic immune response. mutants were attenuated in IFN competent cells and had reduced pathogenesis in vivo. additional studies confirmed increased type I IFN sensitivity but failed IFN augmentation or restoration in IFNAR/ mice. however, deficiency in either MDA5 or IFIT family members resulted in enhanced replication in vitro and restored virulence in vivo. 100 U of recombinant human IFN- (PBL Laboratories)/ml was added to Calu3 cells 16 h prior to inoculation and infected as described above. both wild-type and mutant viruses were derived from either SARS-CoV Urbani or corresponding mouse-adapted (MA15) infectious clone as previously described. the resultant product was digested with BbsI and ligated into the SARS E plasmid. plasmids containing wild-type and mutant SARS-CoV genome fragments were amplified, excised, ligated, and purified. in vitro transcription reactions were performed to synthesize full-length genomic RNA. SP16 were approved by the University of North Carolina Institutional Biosafety Committee. RNA isolation, microarray processing, and identification of differential expression were carried out as previously described (35). differential expression was determined by comparing virus-infected replicates to time-matched mock replicates. infected animals were monitored for weight loss, morbidity, clinical signs of disease, and lung titers. infected mice were challenged at 4 weeks postvaccination with 105 PFU of SARS-CoV MA15. male and female mice were purchased from Harlan Labs; male and female mice were used for studies. animals were randomly assigned to a given chamber each day. plethysmography protocols were carried out in accordance with UNC IACUC guidelines. raw quantitative proteomics data can be accessed at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory's Biological Mass Spectrometry Data and Software Distribution Center. all data sets and associated metadata have been submitted to Virus Pathogen Resource (http://www.viprbrc.org). Viruses, cells, in vitro infection, and plaque assays were cultured on vero E6 cells. both wild-type and mutant viruses were derived from either SARS-CoV Urbani or corresponding mouse-adapted (MA15, referred to here as wild type [WT]) infectious clone. for the K46A mutation, two PCR products were generated by using primers SARS 35 (5\u2032-TGTTGCATTTGAGCTTTGGGC-3\u2032; residues 19707 to 19727) amplicon was digested with BbsI and inserted into the SARS E plasmid. plasmids containing wild-type and mutant SARS-CoV genome fragments were amplified, excised, ligated, and purified. in vitro transcription reactions were performed to synthesize full-length genomic RNA. the criteria for DE were an absolute log2-fold change of >1.5 and a false discovery rate-adjusted P value of 0.05 for a given time point. Plasmids containing both green fluorescent protein (GFP) and shRNA targeting IFIT1 or IFIT2 were a gift from Michael Diamond (Washington University) female BALB/c mice were purchased from Harlan Labs. male and female mice were bred in-house. male and female mice were used for studies. in at least 7 days, tissues were embedded in paraffin. sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and scored in a blinded manner. images were captured using an Olympus BX41 microscope. RESULTS CoV NSP16 are members of the S-SAM-dependent 2\u2032-O-MTase family (20); each member maintains a KDKE catalytic tetrad required for activity (Fig. 1A). Mutation at any one of these residues ablates 2\u2032-O-MTase function (21) vivo experiments in mind, we constructed a mouse-adapted mutant NSP16 virus based on the D130A mutation. this mutation had maintained the most robust replication in Calu3 cells. the resulting mouse-adapted mutant virus (dNSP16) also maintained equivalent replication in Vero cells relative to wild-type mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (MA15; referred to here as WT [data not shown]) dNSP16 mutant viruses attenuation in vitro and in vivo. primary human airway epithelial cultures also maintained a 5- to 10-fold reduction in titer at a later time point. dNSP16 mutant viruses attenuation in vitro and in vivo. a nearly 1,000-fold decrease in dNSP16 virus titer is observed at 4 days postinfection. both measured airway resistance (penH) and expiratory flow rates (EF50) showed only minimal signs of disease after infection with the dNSP16 mutant. dNSP16 mutant viruses are sensitive to type I IFN but not completely restored by its absence in vivo. dNSP16 is more sensitive to IFN but is not restored by type I IFN deficiency. dNSP16 is more sensitive to IFN but is not restored by type I IFN deficiency. similar results were observed for IFNA4 and IFNL1 both in vitro and in vivo. dNSP16-infected IFNAR/ mice maintained slightly augmented virus titers compared to WT SARS-CoV at 2 dpi. both MDA5 and IFIT family members were induced at the RNA and protein levels. both RNA induction and protein production of MDA5, IFIT1 and IFIT2 peak at 4 dpi. in vitro studies directly comparing WT and dNSP16 revealed neither earlier induction nor augmented expression of IFIT1 or MDA5 after the mutant infection. both IFIT1 and IFIT2 KD cells infected with WT SARS-CoV showed a modest increase in viral replication at 24 hpi. by 48 hpi, WT virus titers are equivalent in control and KD cell lines. dNSP16 infection resulted in a substantial increase in viral replication in both IFIT1 and IFIT2 KD cells pretreated with IFN. in vivo RNA expression of IFIT1 (D), IFIT2 (E) and MDA5 (F) was measured by microarray. dNSP16 caused similar weight loss as dNSP16 in both mouse lines. the absence of either IFIT1 or MDA5 restored the ability of dNSP16 to cause breathing difficulties. changes in airway resistance (penH) and expiratory flow rate (EF50) overlapped changes observed during dNSP16 infection. examination of day 7 histology revealed reduced disease in dNSP16-infected B6 mice relative to WT infection in terms of broad lung disease, edema, and vascular cuffing. mice were monitored for weight loss (A to C), virus titer in the lung (D), expiratory flow (E and F), and airway resistance (G and H) for panels E to H, data from mock-infected IFIT1/ and MDA5/ mice were combined to provide a relative baseline for respiratory function. dNSP16-infected mice were vaccinated with 102 PFU of dNSP16 or PBS mock infected. the results showed that dNSP16-infected mice suffered minimal weight loss during initial vaccination. vaccinated mice lost 5% of body weight and were protected from lethal challenge. dNSP16 mutant viruses are attenuated at late time points in respiratory cells and in vivo. dNSP16 mutant viruses maintain similar replication kinetics to WT SARS-CoV over the first 24 hpi. dNSP16-infected mice maintained equivalent levels of weight loss to WT-infected mice. but as the infection progressed, dNSP16-infected mice begin to recover weight. a nearly 1,000-fold decrease in dNSP16 virus titer is observed at 4 days postinfection. dNSP16 mutants are sensitive to type I IFN but not restored by its absence in vivo. attenuation at late time points after both low-multiplicity infection and in vivo is possibly indicative of sensitivity to bystander/feedback IFN signaling. dNSP16-infected mice showed no augmentation or changes in underlying kinetics of type I IFN response. dNSP16-infected mice showed no changes in IFNB1. dNSP16-infected mice showed no augmentation or changes in underlying kinetics of type I IFN response. dNSP16 showed a 10-fold reduction in lung titer compared to WT. partial restoration of viral replication failed to impact pathogenesis. together, the data showed that type I IFN plays a significant role in replication deficits of dNSP16. proteomic values are overlaid with replication during low-multiplicity infection. both RNA induction and protein production of MDA5, IFIT1 and IFIT2 peak at 4 dpi. in vitro studies directly comparing WT and dNSP16 revealed neither earlier induction nor augmented expression of IFIT1, IFIT2 or MDA5 after the mutant infection. DA5 KD cells demonstrated no measurable change in WT or dNSP16 replication. together, these results suggested that IFN-dependent attenuation of dNSP16 is strongly, but not completely dependent on the individual effector activities of IFIT1 and IFIT2. in vitro RNA expression of IFIT1 (A), IFIT2 (B) and MDA5 (C) after infection of C57BL/6 mice. male and female 10-week-old WT, MDA5/, and IFIT1/ C57BL/6 mice were infected with either dNSP16 or WT. dNSP16 caused similar weight loss as WT in both mouse lines. absence of either of these proteins resulted in D4 virus titers equal to or greater than WT titers in both mice. examination of day 4 histology revealed reduced disease in dNSP16-infected mice relative to WT infection in terms of broad lung disease, edema, and vascular cuffing. dNSP16 attenuation in edema and vasculature disease was absent in IFIT1/ and MDA5/, as measured by histology scoring. dNSP16 attenuation in edema and vasculature disease was absent in blinded histology scoring of alveolar exudates (G) and vasculature disease (edema and perivascular cuffing) (H) after infection with WT (solid) or dNSP16 (hatched) infection of C57BL/6 (a, C, and E) or dNSP16 (B, D, and F) mice. dNSP16-infected mice were vaccinated with 100 PFU of dNSP16 or PBS. the results showed that dNSP16-infected mice suffered minimal weight loss during initial vaccination. postchallenge with WT, vaccinated mice lost 5% of body weight. the absence of 2\u2032-O-MTase activity resulted in significant attenuation under immune selective pressure. in vitro, the lack of 2\u2032-O-MTase activity resulted in a modest reduction in virus titers at late time points in both an immunocompetent respiratory cell line and primary human airway cultures. viruses have been shown to be viable without 2\u2032-O-MTase activity. they maintain IFN based attenuation in vitro and in vivo. but unlike 2\u2032-O-MTase mutants in other coronaviruses, dNSP16 failed to induce a more robust type I IFN response. dNSP16 infection resulted in minimal breathing changes in wild-type mice. both airway resistance and lung flow rate were reduced after dNSP16 infection with levels equivalent to WT in IFIT1/ and MDA5/ mice. contrast within 2\u2032-O-MTase mutants suggests tissue and pathogen specificity may play a significant role in differences in mutant restoration. two live attenuated vaccine platforms have been shown to be effective in both young and old mice (52\u201354) however, recent work suggested that a sufficient level of viral replication is required to initiate robust immunity. in vivo attenuation of dNSP16 suggested that vaccination with this mutant could maintain robust replication at early time points but would induce rapid, immune-based clearance at late time points. target drugs and small peptide inhibitors exist (55, 56) for both approaches, target drugs and small peptide inhibitors exist (55, 56) but effective treatment must also overcome type I IFN blockade induced by the virus. results indicate that while attenuation is immune mediated, it is only partially dependent on type I IFN."}
