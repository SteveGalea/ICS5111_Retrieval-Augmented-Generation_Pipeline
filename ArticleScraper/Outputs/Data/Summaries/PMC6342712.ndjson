{"summary": "the most common cause of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is respiratory infection. most studies of bacterial or viral cause in AECOPD have been conducted in western countries. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an obstructive lung disease caused by smoking and air pollution. 1,2 COPD patients often experience sudden aggravation of respiratory symptoms called acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD), and require additional treatment. the cause of admission was something other than AECOPD, such as heart failure, arrhythmia, acute pulmonary edema, acute pulmonary embolism, or pneumothorax. no laboratory or culture test was conducted within 24 hr of hospitalization; or 4) they showed mild to moderate exacerbation of COPD. data were analyzed using SPSS 20 software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) data were presented as meanstandard deviation or number and percent of each group. when events were classified by in-hospital mortality, chi-square test or Fisher's test was used for discrete data. antigen detection assays and polymerase chain reaction assays were performed on blood, sputum, urine, or naso- or oro-pharyngeal swab samples. a rapid antigen test was used to test to detect influenza. pathogen identification A bacterial pathogen was determined to be present if gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria were detected in a blood or sputum sample. RESULTS Study population The number of patients involved in the 736 events was 487. the mean patient age was 72.29.3 years, and the mean length of hospital stay was 10.49.6 days. most (434, 59.0%) of the events occurred in ex-smokers. the most common bacterial pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13.0%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (11.4%), and Haemophilus influenzae (5.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (4.8%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (2.7%). 91 (12.4%) were very severe COPD (stage IV). 307 (41.7%) were severe COPD (Stage III, 30%FEV150% of the predicted value), 281 (38.2%) were moderate COPD (Stage II, 50%FEV180% of the predicted value), and 57 (7.7%) were mild COPD (Stage I, 80%FEV1 of the predicted value) some bacteria and viruses showed no association between identification rate and GOLD stage. 15 (46.9%) showed only bacterial pathogen identification, a higher rate than for non-mortality events. only one of the 32 cases (3.1%) was identified as viral pathogen, significantly lower than in non-mortality events. all events (n = 736) Mortality events in hospital (n=32) Non-mortality events in hospital (n=704) p value Only bacterial identification 200 (27.2) 15 (46.9) 185 (26.3) 0.010 Only viral identification 159 (21.6) 1 (3.1) 158 (22.4) 0.009 Bacterial-viral co-identification 107 (14.5) 8 (25.0) 99 (14.1) 0.118 No identification 270 (36.7) 8 (25.0) 26 analysis according to bacterial-viral co-identification Of the 307 events involving bacterial infection, bacterial-viral co-identification was observed in 107 (40.2%) of the 266 events involving viral infection, bacterial-viral co-identification was observed in 107 (40.2%) of the bacteria, P. aeruginosa had the highest co-identification rate (58.3%); of the viruses, rhinovirus had the highest co-identification rate (49. pathogen identification Pathogens were identified in 466 (63.3%) events among 736 events. 113 (15.4%) events were identified as single pathogen, and 353 (48.0%) events were identified as multiple pathogens. the most common bacterial pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13.0%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (11.4%), and Haemophilus influenzae (5.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (4.8%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (2.7%) the most common viral pathogens were influenza virus (12.4%), rhinovirus (9.4%), parainfluenza virus (5.2%), and metapneumovirus 0.020 Only viral identification 159 (21.6) 16 (28.1) 68 (24.2) 60 (19.5) 15 (16.5) 0.031 Bacterial-viral co-identification 107 (14.5) 4 (7.0) 37 (13.2) 53 (17.3) 13 (14.3) 0.112 No identification 270 (36.7) 26 (45.6) 108 (38.4) 103 (33.6) 33 (36.3) 0.141 Pseudomonas aeruginosa 96 (13. only one of the 32 cases (3.1%) was identified as viral pathogen. other bacteria and viruses also did not show any significant difference in identification rates between mortality and non-mortality events. 0.787 Rhinovirus 69 (9.4) 4 (12.5) 65 (9.2) 0.530 Parainfluenza virus 38 (5.2) 1 (3.1) 37 (5.3) 1.000 Metapneumovirus 36 (4.9) 0 (0.0) 36 (5.1) 0.396 Data are presented as n (%). the most commonly identified bacteria in previous studies of AECOPD have been H. influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and S. pneumoniae. however, in our study, M. catarrhalis was identified in only 8 (1.1%) of 736 AECOPD events. a high prevalence of bronchiectasis was found in patients with moderate to severe COPD. prevalences of bronchiectasis were 10.3% for GOLD stage I, 36.9% for stage II, 49.0% for stage III and 54.1% for stage IV. recent studies have shown that respiratory viral infections cause dysregulation of iron homeostasis mechanisms associated with secondary bacterial infections. bacterial infections in the airway can promote respiratory viral infection. the prevalence of identified pathogens has regional variability. the most commonly identified bacterium associated with AECOPD was P. aeruginosa."}
