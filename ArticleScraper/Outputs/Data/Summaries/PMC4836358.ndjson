{"summary": "coronaviruses (CoVs) are a family of enveloped positive-strand RNA viruses that cause disease in numerous mammalian and avian hosts. the two of greatest current concern are the etiologic agents of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) the critical role of E protein is carried out at the site of budding, the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment, with very little E being carried over into assembled virions (8). M protein captures S protein for incorporation into virions or VLPs (9, 10), but S is an optional participant in virus formation (11, 12) membrane domain; NTD (N1b), amino-terminal RNA-binding domain; SR, serine- and arginine-rich region; CTD (N2b), carboxy-terminal RNA-binding domain; B, spacer region; N3, carboxy-terminal domain. vertical bars between the ecto, Tm domains, and endodomain (endo), functional crossover boundaries in the constructed chimeras. interactions of M protein with N protein (20\u201324, 32, 33) and with S protein (34, 35) were made through manipulation of the EcoRV-PspXI fragment running from the end of the E gene through the end of the E gene and to the start of the N gene. this strategy allowed us to further define M-N and M-M interactions. s were generated via PCR or two-step PCR using a cloned SARS-CoV M-gene cDNA as the template. the entire SARS-CoV M substitution in vectors pMN4A, pMN4B, pMN4C, pMN5A, pMN5B, pMN5B, pMN5B, pMN7, pMN9, and wild-type and mutant MN8 viruses were grown in 17Cl1 cell monolayers infected at a multiplicity of 1 PFU/cell. virions were purified by polyethylene glycol precipitation followed by equilibrium centrifugation on preformed gradients of 20 to 30% iodixanol (OptiPrep; Sigma-Aldrich) RNA denatured with formaldehyde and formamide was directly dot blotted onto Nytran Supercharge membranes by filtration through a vacuum manifold. membranes were hybridized with a PCR-amplified probe corresponding to nucleotides 401 to 909 of the MHV genome, a region unique to genomic RNA (and absent from subgenomic RNA) MHV A59 wild-type and mutant virus stocks were grown at 37\u00b0C in mouse 17 clone 1 (17Cl1) cells. the host-range chimeric coronavirus designated fMHV.v2 (36), used as the recipient virus for reverse genetics, was grown in feline FCWF cells. the entire SARS-CoV M substitution in vectors pMN4A, pMN4B, pMN4C, pMN5A, pMN5B, pMN5B, pMN7, pMN8 and pMN10 was an exact replacement of the MHV M open reading frame (ORF) the entire SARS-CoV M substitution in vectors pMN2, pMN4B, at least three independent isolates were obtained for viable chimeric viral mutants. the exceptions were mutants MN6 and MN7, each of which was isolated only once. chimeric constructs were judged to be lethal after yielding no recombinants. membranes were hybridized with a PCR-amplified probe corresponding to nucleotides 401 to 909 of the MHV genome. the probe was labeled by use of an AlkPhos Direct kit. the RNA in the blots was visualized using a bio-Rad ChemiDoc XRS+ instrument. the equivalence of the M endodomain of MHV with that of the very closely related bovine coronavirus (BCoV) was demonstrated in an earlier study (40). however, we anticipated that substitution of the much less homologous SARS-CoV M protein would provide a more stringent test of compatible and incompatible intermolecular interactions. a chimeric construct that paired the MHV M protein with the MHV domain N3 (mutant MN1) was lethal, confirming earlier results (15). a chimeric construct that paired the MHV M protein with the MHV domain N3 (mutant MN2) was also lethal. previous work has established that the highly variable spacer B is not essential for virion formation. infectious titers measured at all three temperatures were 8.6 107 PFU/ml for the wild type and 2.3 106 PFU/ml for the wild type. the third isolate had two coding changes in the S endodomain, the E gene, or the chimeric N gene. a monoclonal antibody that recognizes an epitope in wild-type MHV domain N3 (21) did not react with the chimeric MN3 N protein. the mutant grew to an 40-fold lower infectious titer than did wild-type virus and formed smaller plaques at 37\u00b0C. this plaque size difference was more pronounced at 33\u00b0C, and at 39\u00b0C MN3 plaques were tiny compared to those of the wild type. MHV-CoV E protein was nearly completely able to replace the MHV E protein (38) this suggests that wild-type MHV E cannot optimally cooperate with SARS-CoV M in virion morphogenesis. the finding was unexpected because we had previously found that the SARS-CoV E protein was nearly completely able to replace the MHV E protein. the resulting E-M chimera, MN6, formed very small plaques at 37\u00b0C and pinpoint plaques at 39\u00b0C. it had a 3-fold lower infectious titer than the MN3 mutant. this unforeseen outcome may have been the result of distinct activities of the substituted E protein (46) acting in conflict with each other. the first of these, MN8 retained the entire SARS-CoV M protein. the crossover point between the MHV and SARS-CoV sequences chosen was a conserved pair of residues (WN) in two additional recombinants, MN9 and MN10, both the MHV ectodomain and Tm domains were restored. titrations were carried out on L2 cells; monolayers were stained with neutral red at 72 h postinfection and were photographed 18 h later. Schematics of lethal substitutions in chimeras MN4A to MN4C, MN5A, and MN5B, made in attempts to define a carboxy-terminal subregion of the M endodomain sufficient for interaction with domain N3. we were not able to subdivide the M-protein endodomain in order to define a minimal region capable of interacting with N protein. in constructs MN4A, MN4B, and MN4C, the MHV M sequence was grafted onto the tail of the MHV M protein at conserved residues positioned 30 (SGFA), 43 (YK) or 20 (GNY) amino acids. preliminary evidence showed that virions of MN3 and MN8 were defective in the selective packaging of genomic RNA. this suggests a possible basis for their reduced infectivity. these observations prompted us to examine SARS-CoV M chimeric virions in more detail. of MN8 virions contained slightly more genomic RNA than wild-type virions. the peaks of protein and RNA coincided with the respective peaks of infectivity. this indicated that MN8 virions did not consist of separate pools of empty and RNA-containing particles. MHV S protein is synthesized as a 180-kDa glycoprotein, S0. it is cleaved by cellular proteases into amino- and carboxy-terminal halves, S1 and S2 respectively. in contrast, only minor quantities of S2 were detected in MN8 virions. virions of the original chimera, MN3, had an even more severely reduced incorporation of S protein than did those of the wild type. the level of S-protein incorporation into various SARS-CoV M-protein chimeras was consistent with their relative titers. this modification further impaired the virus, since the substitutions in the MN11 construct were lethal. west blotting lysates from mouse 17Cl1 cells infected with wild-type or MN8 virus. lysates were separated in 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and probed with polyclonal anti-S antibody. we constructed an MHV chimera containing the entire SARS-CoV M protein. a chimeric construct that paired the MHV M protein with the SARS-CoV domain N3 (mutant MN1) was lethal, confirming earlier results (15). a chimeric construct that paired the MHV M protein with the SARS-CoV domain N3 (mutant MN1) was lethal, confirming earlier results (15). coV M protein with MHV domain N3 (mutant MN2) was lethal. previous work has established that the highly variable spacer B is not essential for virion formation. MHV N spacer B can be altered with a divergent coronavirus sequence (44) or an epitope tag (21) or even entirely replaced with a synthetic flexible linker peptide sequence (14). infectious titers measured at all three temperatures were 8.6 107 PFU/ml for the wild type and 2.3 106 PFU/ml for the MN3 mutant. two of the three contained the exact SARS-CoV M-gene sequence. the third isolate had two coding changes in M, N206S and T207A. monoclonal antibody that recognizes an epitope in wild-type MHV domain N3 (21) did not react with the chimeric MN3 N protein. this grew to an 40-fold lower infectious titer than did wild-type virus and formed smaller plaques at 37\u00b0C. this plaque size difference was more pronounced at 33\u00b0C, and at 39\u00b0C MN3 plaques were tiny compared to those of the wild type. a finding was unexpected, because we had previously found that the SARS-CoV E protein was nearly completely able to replace the MHV E protein (38). the geneBank accession numbers for the sequences shown are AY700211 for MHV A59 and AY278741 for SARS-CoV strain Urbani. we reconstructed the mutation from the most robust of the revertants, MN3rev3. the mutation exhibited substantially larger plaques than the MN3 mutant at 37\u00b0C and 39\u00b0C. this established that the F20S mutation alone is capable of significantly enhancing the growth of the MN3 mutant. the crossover point between the MHV and SARS-CoV sequences chosen was a conserved pair of residues (WN) as with the MN7 construct, the E protein of MN8 incorporated the F20S mutation and domain N3 of the SARS-CoV N protein. both the ectodomain and Tm domains were restored to the SARS-CoV M protein. the ectodomains of the MHV and SARS-CoV M proteins diverge extensively. the ectodomains of the MHV and SARS-CoV M proteins are O-glycosylated (49), whereas the SARS-CoV M-protein ectodomain is N-glycosylated (50). these differences appeared to have no major effect on the growth of MN8 at 37\u00b0C. constructs MN4A, MN4B, and MN4C tested potential crossover points. domain N3 of the N protein was derived from the species to which the tail of the M protein belonged. none of these five constructs yielded viable viruses, despite numerous independent trials of targeted RNA recombination. virions of MN8 and the wild type were purified by equilibrium centrifugation on continuous gradients of 20 to 30% iodixanol. this difference was confirmed by the nearly identical density profiles of the two gradients shown in Fig. 5A. this difference was confirmed by the nearly identical density profiles of the two gradients shown in Fig. 5A. RNA coincided with the respective peaks of infectivity. this indicated that MN8 virions did not consist of separate pools of empty particles. infectivity was summed over fractions 4 through 11. lysates of infected cells showed that the wild type and MN8 expressed equivalent amounts of S protein. intracellular S was almost all in the uncleaved S0 form. however, no such membrane-bound remnant of S was found in MN8 virions. virions of the original chimera, MN3, had an even more severely reduced incorporation of S protein than did those of the wild type. however, the level of S-protein incorporation into various SARS-CoV M-protein chimeras was consistent with their relative titers. this mutant incorporated the SARS-CoV S-protein Tm domain and endodomain. west blot of lysates from mouse 17Cl1 cells infected with wild-type or MN8 virus. Western blot of wild-type and MN8 virions separated in a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and probed with polyclonal anti-S antibody. we have now applied this approach to the M protein. analysis of the chimera MN8 showed that its virions contained abundant amounts of N and M proteins in a ratio comparable to that of wild-type virions. the sufficiency of N3 accords well with cryo-EM and tomographic reconstructions of MHV and SARS-CoV virions. an analysis of SARS-CoV M and N proteins found the carboxy terminus of N to be required for the formation of virus-like particles with M but proposed an additional M-binding site falling in the center of the NTD. the biological relevance of any of these reported interactions remains to be determined, but our results establish that they are not required for virion assembly. truncated endodomain variants of the M protein, designated M*, evolved by gene duplication in MHV E-deletion mutants to compensate for the absence of E protein. similar M* proteins have also very recently been observed to arise upon passaging of SARS-CoV E-deletion mutants. mutations in several second-site revertants of defective MHV M or N assembly mutants mapped to positions considerably upstream in the M endodomain (20, 21, 23) this convergence presents a strong argument that upstream regions of the M endodomain make direct or indirect contributions to the interaction with N protein. the transplanted SARS-CoV M protein did not perform well with the other two structural proteins of MHV. however, the marked temperature sensitivity of the original M chimera, MN3, was found to be partially suppressed by mutations in the MHV E protein. this is the first observed instance of genetic cross talk between the M and E proteins. the consequences of deletion of the E gene were seen to vary from modest impairment for SARS-CoV (66) to severe impairment for MHV (38, 67) and lethality for TGEV and MERS-CoV (68, 69); also, for SARS-CoV, the E-deletion phenotype was dependent on cell type. a transplant of the SARS-CoV M protein into MHV placed it in a heterologous environment. previous work showed that the SARS-CoV S-protein Tm domain and endodomain were completely able to replace their MHV S counterpart (43, 70). a foreign membrane protein harboring the SARS-CoV S Tm domain and endodomain was incorporated into MHV virions at a slightly higher efficiency than the MHV version of the same protein (43). a second possible cause of the sparse incorporation of S protein into MN8 virions could be that no evidence that MHV S protein was incorporated into MN8 virions. but subsequently degraded, as was found to happen with a particular E-protein mutant of IBV. further work will be required to unravel the complete range of intermolecular interactions in which the coronavirus M protein participates. a new study used glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays to map the SARS-CoV N-M interaction to a segment of N. the carboxy terminus of N was required for the formation of virus-like particles with M. the biological relevance of any of these reported interactions remains to be determined, but our results establish that they are not required for virion assembly. MHV M were linked to the endodomain of SARS-CoV M. the viability of these constructs suggests that folding and oligomerization of the M-protein Tm domains and the endodomain, for the most part, occur independently of one another. this conclusion is consistent with our previous finding of truncated endodomain variants of the M protein, designated M*. in vitro assays with TGEV (32) and SARS-CoV (33) M-protein fragments appeared to localize the N-binding component of M to within 30 residues of the carboxy terminus. this negative result accords well with previous findings that the mutations in several second-site revertants of defective MHV M or N assembly mutants mapped to positions considerably upstream in the M endodomain. despite the complete reconstitution of the M-N interaction in chimeric viruses, the transplanted SARS-CoV M protein did not perform well with the other two structural proteins of MHV. however, the marked temperature sensitivity of the original M chimera was found to be partially suppressed by mutations in the MHV E protein. not all functions of E protein appear to be required by all coronaviruses. the consequences of deletion of the E gene were seen to vary from modest impairment for SARS-CoV (66) to severe impairment for MHV (38, 67) and lethality for TGEV and MERS-CoV (68, 69) a defect in virion morphogenesis in the chimera could be that the SARS-CoV M protein cannot efficiently bind to the MHV S endodomain. a second possible cause of the sparse incorporation of S protein into MN8 virions could be that the two proteins colocalize too briefly to do so efficiently. a deficiency in MN8 with respect to S protein contacting the SARS-CoV M protein should have been rescued by the SARS-CoV S endodomain substitution in the MN11 chimera. further work will be required to unravel the complete range of intermolecular interactions."}
