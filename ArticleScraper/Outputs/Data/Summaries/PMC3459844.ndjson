{"summary": "natural regulatory T cells (Tregs) play an important role in down-regulating immune responses and an imbalance between numbers of Tregs and conventional CD4 (Tconv) and CD8 T cells contributes to outcomes in cancer and autoimmune and infectious diseases [1]\u2013[4]. Interactions between Tregs and non-Tregs result in modifications of the function of both cell types. IL-12 was shown to induce IFN- production by Tregs in vitro and in vivo [5], [13]. this suggests that IFN- expression is a marker for reduced immunosuppressive ability. however, whether IL-12 actually affects Treg suppressive function has not been assessed. e were housed in the Animal Care Facility at the University of Iowa. the protocol was approved by the University of Iowa Animal Care and Use Committee. cells were cultured with soluble anti-CD3 mAb (0.5 g/ml) unless indicated, cells were cultured at 1106 cells/ml in 24-well tissue culture plates. cells were labeled with CFSE (2 M, Invitrogen) before culture. 2105 unfractionated lymphocytes were treated for 72 hr in a 96-well round-bottom plate. in parallel wells, 2105 unfractionated lymphocytes were treated in triplicate. solation Kit II, and Tregs were isolated from B6 mice using a CD4+CD25+ Regulatory T cell Isolation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec) for suppression assays, Tregs were mixed with CFSE-labeled (2.5 M) responder T cells at the indicated ratios. cells were cultured in the presence of 2105 irradiated splenocytes and anti-CD3 mAb. IL-2 ELISAs were performed using reagents and protocols provided by the manufacturer (eBioscience, Mouse IL-2 ELISA Ready-SET-Go kit) samples were plated in duplicate. differences between two groups were determined by Student\u2019s two-tailed unpaired t tests or paired t tests. as CpG (ODN1668, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and LPS (R-form, ALEXIS Biochemicals, Farmingdale, NY) were obtained from the indicated vendors. the following antibodies and reagents were used: CD4-FITC, -PE or -PerCP-Cy5.5 (RM 4\u20135), IL-2-PE (JES6-5H4), CD25-PE or -APC (PC-61),CD122- treatment with TLR Agonists 5x106 B16-Flt3L cells [14] were inoculated subcutaneously into 12-wk old B6 mice. spleens were harvested, digested with collagenase and DCs were isolated using anti-CD11c microbeads. Tregs were co-cultured with CFSE-labeled (2.5 M) responder Tconvs at the indicated ratios. wells also contained 2105 T-cell depleted splenocytes (irradiated at 2500 rad) and anti-CD3 mAb. cell sorting was performed with a FACSDiva or FACSAria. ELISA Lymphocytes from lymph nodes of B6 mice were stimulated with anti-CD3 mAb. IL-12 (1 ng/ml) or IFN- (100 ng/ml) in 24-well plates. IL-12, IL-6 and IFN- have roles in T cell polarization and Treg development [16]\u2013[20], so we first evaluated their participation in Treg-mediated IFN- expression. cells were then stimulated for 4 hours with PMA and ionomycin and evaluated for T cell proliferation and IFN- expression. IL-12, but not IL-6 or IFN- induces IFN- expression by Foxp3+ Tregs. lymph nodes were prepared from lymph nodes of nave B6 mice. cells were then stimulated with PMA and ionomycin for 4 hr. IL-12 induces T-bet expression by Tconvs and Tregs. T cells (B6 or IL-12R2/) and splenic DCs (B6) were isolated and incubated together in the presence of anti-CD3 mAb. IL-12R2/ mice are deficient in IL-12 but not IL-23 signaling. TLR agonists induction of IFN- expression by Tconvs and Tregs is IL-12-dependent. cells were stimulated for 72 hr with anti-CD3 mAb. both sets of Tregs (IFN-+ or IFN--) were mixed with CFSE-labeled Tconvs. cells were then stimulated with anti-CD3 antibody in the absence of IL-12. a previous report showed that Treg suppressive function was alleviated by IL-12. we observed diminished suppression of CFSE-labeled CD4 T cells in the presence of IL-12. IL-12 does not induce apoptosis in Tconvs or Tregs. IL-12 induces IFN- expression by Tregs. if IL-12 also mediated Treg conversion, this would contribute to a decrease in Treg. if IL-12 also mediated Treg conversion, this would contribute to a decrease in Treg. IL-12 inhibits IL-2 expression by Tconv and CD8 T cells. IL-12 differially affects IL-2R expression by Tregs and non-Treg T Cells. IL-12 diminishes IL-2 expression by CD4 T cells. IL-12 inhibits IL-2 expression by T cells. the fraction of CD4 and CD8 T cells expressing IL-2 was diminished after 48 and 66 hr. data are representative of 2 independent experiments performed in triplicate for stimulation. IL-12 diminished Foxp3 GMFI in Tregs. one of the effects of IL-12 treatment was decreased Foxp3 expression by Tregs. IL-2 treatment partially reversed the effect of IL-12. IL-27 reduced CD25 and CD122 expression on Tregs. but only marginally affected expression on non-Tregs. IL-27 inhibits IL-2 production, but only modestly affects IL-2R expression by Tconv and CD8 T cells. cytokines are up-regulated in the CNS of MHV-infected mice. IL-12, IL-6 and IFN- have roles in T cell polarization and Treg development [16]\u2013[20], so we first evaluated their participation in Treg-mediated IFN- expression by Tregs and Tconvs. IL-12 reduced both Tconv and Treg proliferation in IL-12-treated cells. the net result was a decreased proportion of Tregs expressing reduced levels of Foxp3 in IL-12-treated cell cultures. IL-6 reduced both Tconv and Treg proliferation. IL-12 treatment increases expression of T-bet, a transcription factor associated with Th1 development [19], [20], [7], [8]. IL-12 induces T-bet expression by Tconvs and Tregs. LPS and CpG likely functioned via effects on DCs. no IFN- was induced when unfractionated lymph node-derived lymphocytes were treated with LPS or CpG in the absence of added DCs. IL-12R2/ mice are deficient in IL-12 but not IL-23 signaling. spleen and lymph node-derived lymphocytes isolated from Foxp3gfp mice were treated with anti-CD3 mAb in the presence or absence of IL-12. both sets of Tregs (IFN-+ or IFN--) were then mixed with CFSE-labeled Tconvs. a previous report showed that Treg suppression was alleviated by IL-12. responder T cells were labeled with CFSE and co-cultured with unlabeled Tregs at several cell ratios. IL-12 treatment did not increase the percentage of either AnnexinV+ Tregs or Tconvs in the cultures, demonstrating that there was no preferential Treg death. if IL-12 also mediated Treg conversion, this would contribute to a decrease in Treg. p/Thy1.1 mice mixed with lymphocytes harvested from nave Foxp3gfp mice (Thy1.2) samples were incubated for 72 hr with anti-CD3 mAb. IL-12 inhibits IL-2 expression by Tconv and CD8 T cells. IL-12 diminishes IL-2 expression by CD4 T cells. treatment with IL-12 in the presence of anti-CD3 mAb induced up-regulation of both the (CD25) and (CD122) chains of the IL-2R on Tregs while not affecting CD122 expression. IL-12 treatment diminished CD25 expression on Tregs while not affecting CD122 expression. representative histograms are shown in (A) and summary data are shown in (B). IL-12 decreased Foxp3 expression on Tconvs and CD8 T cells but not on Tregs. IL-2 treatment partially reversed the effect of IL-12. IL-27 diminished IL-2 production by Tconvs and CD8 T cells. however, unlike IL-12, IL-27 decreased proliferation of Tconvs and Tregs. IL-27 reduced CD25 and CD122 expression on Tregs but only marginally affected expression on non-Tregs. IL-27 treatment resulted in small changes in CD25 expression on Tregs and CD8 T cells but not Tconvs and in a small decrease in CD122 expression on all three cell types. data are representative of 3 independent experiments. IL-2 levels are reduced at these sites, resulting in the outgrowth of non-Treg T cells. these changes result in diminished Treg proliferation and perhaps decreased Treg suppressive function on a per cell basis. the importance of IL-2 for Treg function is well established [29], [35], [36]. Tregs express IFN- expression at sites of inflammation under conditions of lethal and non-lethal infections [5], [8]. it has been difficult to determine whether IFN- affects Treg suppressive function. we infected IL-12R2/ mice with the mildly neurovirulent rJ2.2 strain of MHV. we detected slightly lower frequencies of virus-specific IFN- expressing Tregs and Tconv in IL-12R2/ mice. this was consistent with a previous report showing IL-12 modestly decreased the frequencies of virus-specific T cells in MHV-infected IL-12p35/ mice. suppression results from effects on IL-2 and IL-2R expression and by extension, differential IL-2 signaling in mixed cultures of lymphocytes."}
