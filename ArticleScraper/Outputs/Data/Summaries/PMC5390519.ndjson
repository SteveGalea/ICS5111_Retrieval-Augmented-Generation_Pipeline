{"summary": "viral RNA must house diverse cis-acting elements for minus-strand, plus-strand, and possibly subgenomic RNA syntheses. cis-acting elements could also be involved in cell-to-cell or systemic movement and encapsidation of viral RNA. single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome contains five open reading frames. ORF1 encodes a replicase for viral RNA replication. ORF2 encodes a 28-kDa protein (a silencing suppressor) required for viral movement. ORF5 encodes a 25-kDa capsid protein for viral encapsidation, movement, and symptom development. RNAs of tobacco mosaic virus (Kawakami et al., 2004; Nishikiori et al., 2006), Tomato ringspot virus (Han and Sanfacon, 2003), Cowpea mosaic virus (Carette et al., 2000), and Tobacco etch virus (Schaad et al., 1997) are transported to the endoplasmic reticulum membranes. glycerate kinase (PGK) was revealed (Lin et al., 2007; Cheng et al., 2013). a pseudoknot, including the poly(A) sequence at the extreme 3\u2032 end, is the target of PGK. in vitro and in vivo studies, the interaction is required for efficient replication. cis-acting elements in the 3\u2032 UTR are far from the extreme 3\u2032 end of the initiation site if poly(A)-tailed viruses use a similar synthesis mechanism as described for non-poly(A)-tailed RNA viruses. in vitro and in vivo studies of BaMV revealed that the extreme 5\u2032 end of minus-strand RNA contains stretch of uridine residues ranging from 1 to 15 nt. the 3\u2032 UTR can be divided into three portions: the 5\u2032 part consisting of three stem\u2013loops that form a cloverleaf-like structure. the middle part following the ABC domain is a major stem\u2013loop with a bulge and an internal loop, designated as the D domain. the 3\u2032 part of the UTR that forms the pseudoknot is described previously that interacts with eEF1a and PGK. the tertiary structure of BaMV 3\u2032 UTR interacts with the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the helicase-like domains shown in light orange and light purple ovals. maintaining the structures of D and E domains is critical for efficient viral RNA replication. stem\u2013loops B and C of the ABC domain in the 3\u2032 UTR play a lesser, but significant, role in RNA replication. accumulation of viral products of mutants with deleted stem\u2013loop A did not differ significantly from that of wild type in protoplasts. the terminal UUUUC pentamer is the most critical cis-acting element in BaMV. the replicase contains two domains that interact with the promoter. the replicase catalytic center interacts with the terminal UUUUC sequence, and the specificity domain interacts with the large stem\u2013loop. the extreme 5\u2032 end of minus-strand RNA has a short run of uridylates. the extreme 3\u2032 end of plus-strand RNA immediately after synthesis accordingly has a short run of uridylates. cis-acting element AAUAAA in the 3\u2032 UTR plays a role in polyadenylation. a short non-coding RNA derived from genomic RNA generated by host exonuclease is another strategy to synthesize subgenomic RNA. they commonly rely on cis-acting RNA elements to direct the viral-encoded RdRp to transcribe these RNAs. two major sgRNAs of approximately 2 and 1 kb in length direct translation of ORF2 and ORF5 respectively. kb sgRNA synthesis folds into two stem\u2013loops, stem\u2013loop (SL)1 and SL2 in minus strand. cis-acting elements of SGP for 2-kb sgRNA synthesis are located at nt -119 to +11 (the transcription start site of the 2-kb sgRNA is designated as +1) the long-distance RNA\u2013RNA interaction between the conserved octamer motif and the 3\u2032-terminal sequence of minus-strand genomic RNA was demonstrated to be required for transcription of PVX sgRNAs. as in an ortholog, a similar interaction was revealed in BaMV with shorter complementary pairing than those in PVX. target sites, minus-strand RNA synthesis, plus-strand genomic RNA synthesis, viral movements, and viral encapsidation. the signal for the encapsidation of BaMV RNA is very likely in the 5\u2032 UTR."}
