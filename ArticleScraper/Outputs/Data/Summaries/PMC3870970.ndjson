{"summary": "Background Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is an economically important causative agent of infectious bronchitis in chickens. it causes acute and highly contagious upper respiratory tract infections that may lead to nephritis. however, the molecular antiviral mechanisms of chickens to IBV infection remain poorly understood. infected chickens develop respiratory symptoms, kidney and oviduct lesions, reduced egg production with poor egg quality, and possible secondary complications. IBV-induced kidney lesions are typically characterized by interstitial nephritis and tubule lesions that are most prominent in the medulla. the gene transcription profiles of tracheal epithelial cells were examined 3 days postinfection with an attenuated IBV-Massachusetts strain. these authors investigated 25 direct immune-related genes and found an up-regulation in toll-like receptor (TLR)2, TLR3, IFN-induced antiviral genes (Mx) and genes responsible for cytotoxic T cell killing. sally inoculated with 0.1 mL of 105.5 median embryo infectious doses of strain ck/CH/LDL/091022 [14] at 15 days of age. two birds in group 1 died at 5 and 6 days postinoculation. fresh tissue samples of kidney from each dead bird were collected at each time point corresponding to the bird deaths. the cRNA probes were hybridized to a 4 44 K Agilent custom chicken oligo microarray (design ID: 017698) annotations for the microarray genes were downloaded from the national center for biotechnology information (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), the Gene Ontology (GO) and UniProt (http://www.uniprot.org/) databases. RNA was extracted using TRIzol Reagent (TaKaRa Biotech Co., Ltd., Dalian, China) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. one-step real-time RT-PCR reactions were performed using the One Step PrimeScript\u00ae RT-PCR kit (TaKaRa Biotech Co., Ltd.)

RNA was quantified and qualified using the QiagenRNeasy Mini Kit. 2 g of total RNA were converted to cDNA, synthesized to Cy3-labelled cRNA, and amplified for one round using a commercial array service (Agilent Technologies, America) real-time RT-PCR for confirmation Twelve genes of interest were selected for confirmation with 18S serving as an endogenous control.

IL1RL1, IL1R1, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 2, TLR4, signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), and myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MYD88) were associated with many signaling pathways. a highly virulent nephropathogenic IBV strain, ck/CH/LDL/091022 [14], was used in this study to infect SPF chickens. fresh kidney tissue samples were also collected from a second chicken infected with ck/CH/LDL/091022 at the time of death. only genes that were differentially regulated more than three-fold in both IBV-infected chickens in response to IBV infection were compared to those of nephropathogenic strain ck/CH/LDL/091022 is more virulent than ck/CH/LDL/97I. the more virulent strain persisted longer in the birds. innate immunity provides a first line of defense against pathogens and can be rapidly activated following infection. the transcription level of TLR15, a poultry-specific TLR, was significantly up-regulated after infection with Marek\u2019s disease virus [22], infectious bursa disease virus infection [23], and avian influenza virus H9N2-infected chickens in the lungs [24], implicating a similar role of TLR15 in sensing and initiating responses to viruses after infection. in this study, MDA5 expression levels were significantly increased after IBV infection. kB, STAT1, MyD88, OSAL, MX1, IFIT5, ISG12-2, RSAD2, IFI35, and IFI27L2 were all up-regulated. a previous report showed that STAT1 expression was significantly increased response to IBV infection in ovo[10], suggesting that IBV infection can activate the JAK-STAT pathway and activate transcription of ISGs. ubiquitin-like pathway plays an important role in anti-IBV responses. cytokine and chemokine expression were observed after IBV infection. IL6, IL18, IL10RA, IL17RA, IL17RA, CCL4, CCL20, and IL10 may have similar functions in IBV infection. l-2L1, BCL2-antagonist/killer 1, and eukaryotic initiation factor 2a genes were significantly increased compared to the control group. the caspase proteins are executioners of apoptosis [41]. both pro-apoptotic (e.g., Bax and Bak) and anti-apoptotic proteins from the Bcl-2 family are key proteins in the intrinsic apoptosis signaling pathway. several other immune function-related genes were up-regulated, including major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigen, MR1, MHC BF1 class I, immunoresponsive 1 homolog, secreted phosphoprotein 1, the complement system, among other genes involved in the IFR response. both adaptive and innate immunity responded to IBV infection and the complement system might be a functional bridge between innate and adaptive immune responses to allow an integrated host defense to pathogenic challenges. total of 103 DE genes were identified in this study. these genes may play major roles in the host defense response or/and IBV pathogenesis. authors declare that they have no competing interests.
