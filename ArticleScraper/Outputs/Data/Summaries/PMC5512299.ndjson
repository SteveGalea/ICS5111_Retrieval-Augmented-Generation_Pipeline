{"summary": "central memory T (TCM) cells express lymph node-homing receptors L-selectin (CD62L) and CC-chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7). TEM cells lack expressions of these receptors and circulate between lymph nodes and blood. TEM cells undergo extensive expansion in the draining lymph nodes before migrating to the site of infection. cross reactive CD8+ T cell-mediated immunity can provide protection against different viral strains (heterosubtypic immunity) (21) understanding mechanisms by which CD8+ TRM cells are established in the lung has important implications for vaccine development. both TRM populations confer rapid protection against secondary infection. CD8+ T cell priming occurs in the lung-draining mediastinal lymph nodes (MLN) after lung-resident antigen-presenting cells have transported viral antigens to that site. two subsets of respiratory DCs transport viral antigens from the lung and prime naive CD8+ T cells in the MLN (60) CD11bhi respiratory DCs uniquely upregulate CD70, the ligand for CD27, in response to thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) secreted by virus-infected lung epithelial cells. the weaker stimulatory potential of CD11bhi respiratory DCs presumably explains their characteristics. the distinct functionality of respiratory DC subsets critically impacts the memory CD8+ T cell heterogeneity. a majority of CD8+ T cells purified from the lung tissues in earlier studies were contaminants from the blood. i.v. staining has revolutionized the analysis of lung TRM (5,6) effector CD8+ T cells migrate into the interstitium of normal lungs more efficiently than naive CD8+ T cells. the extent is much less than that observed in the presence of infection/inflammation in the lung (123). the migration of circulating memory CD8+ T cells to the lung under steady-state conditions is relatively limited. CD8+ TRM precursors are recruited to the site of tissue damage during later stages of the infection. CD8+ TRM niches (RAMDs) are created as a consequence of tissue remodeling and provide temporal spaces for the maintenance of CD8+ TRM cells. chemokines regulate selective migration of T cells to those tissues. in 47 and CCR9 for the intestines, cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen [CLA], CCR4 and CCR10 for the skin, respectively, have not yet been reported. inflammatory chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXC chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3) have been shown to be involved. CXCR3 is expressed in a large fraction of antigen-specific effector as well as memory CD8+ T cells. some cells maintain the expression of CXCR3 and are preferentially recruited to the vicinity of virus-infected epithelial cells and airway lumen. some cells maintain the expression of CXCR3 and are preferentially recruited to the vicinity of virus-infected epithelial cells. active recruitment of effector T cells into inflamed tissues (2,38,85) this chemokine is constitutively expressed in the lung (18,127) this chemokine is constitutively expressed in the lung (18,127) this chemokine is constitutively expressed in the lung (18,127) effector CD8+ T cells migrate into the interstitium of normal lungs more efficiently than naive CD8+ T cells (33), the extent is much less than that observed in the presence of infection/inflammation in the lung (123). the migration of circulating memory CD8+ T cells to the lung under steady-state conditions is also relatively limited. CD8+ TEM cells are recruited to the uninfected lung interstitium during steady state (basal recruitment) those cells are segregated from the CD8+ TRM niches and residual antigen-presenting cells in the lung. chemokines regulate selective migration of T cells to those tissues. ine receptor 3 (CXCR3) have been shown to be involved (134) ligands regulate the basal recruitment of CCR5+ effector CD8+ T cells to the interstitium (33) Upon respiratory virus infection, expression of CCR5 binding chemokines as well as CXCR3 binding chemokines is upregulated in the lung. some cells maintain expression of CXCR3 and are preferentially recruited to the vicinity of virus-infected epithelial cells and airway lumen. some cells that receive signals from IL-12 and IL-15 downregulate CXCR3 and are retained in the peribronchioarterial area where they provide a second wave of protection (1). phingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) plays a key role in the egress of lymphocytes from the lymph nodes and thymus (4,86) a balance between the S1P-mediated exit signal and the chemokine-mediated migratory signals controls the direction of T cell migration. this potentially reflects the differential dynamics between TEM and TRM cells within the peripheral tissues. recruitment of CD8+ T cells into the lung does not lead to the downregulation of Klf2 or its downstream target S1pr1 (123) local reactivation and subsequent upregulation of CD69 are likely crucial for the temporal retention of tissue-circulating CD8+ T cells in the lung unless a CD69-intact wild-type competitor T cell is present (123). however, during the acute phase of infection, inflammation-induced chemotactic signaling overrides the S1P integrin-mediated retention in the specific microenvironment of the lung. high levels of integrin 11 (VLA-1: very late antigen-1) and E7 (detected by CD49a and CD103, respectively) are unique hallmarks of CD8+ TRM cells in the lung compared to circulatory memory CD8+ T cell populations in the lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues. integrin E7 also promotes retention of effector CD8+ T cells in the lung airways. it is unclear what signals are responsible for upregulation of VLA-1 on CD8+ T cells. lack of this signal results in the complete loss of CD103+ CD8+ T cells in the lung. CD4+ T cell-derived interferon- (IFN-) potentially contributes to the secretion of TGF- in the lung. sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) plays a key role in the egress of lymphocytes from the lymph nodes. basal recruitment results in significant loss of tissue-circulating CD8+ T cells as well as CD8+ TRM precursors in the nonlymphoid tissues, including the lung (78,115,123), which is likely due to the accelerated tissue egress mediated by S1P1. however, recruitment of CD8+ T cells into the lung does not lead to the downregulation of Klf2 or its downstream target S1pr1 (123) antigen recognition leads to downregulation of CCR7 on effector CD8+ T cells. antigen-dependent selective retention of effector CD8+ T cells may prevent overt pathogenesis by decreasing the number of bystander T cells at the site of infection. integrins fine-tune distribution of migrant CD8+ T cells within the lung. binding of VLA-1 to type IV collagen also protects effector CD8+ T cells in the airways from apoptosis during the acute phase of infection. CD49a expression defines a marker of CD8+ TRM cells having a highly cytolytic potential (13) however, additional experiments are required to precisely resolve the question where and when upregulation of VLA-1 occurs. transforming growth factor- (TGF-) signaling is known to be necessary for the upregulation of integrin E7. a second hit with cognate antigen in the peripheral tissues plays a key role for TRM differentiation. a second hit with cognate antigen in the peripheral tissues plays a key role for terminal effector differentiation. the decision to become a terminal effector or TRM cell following local reactivation may be cell-intrinsically precommitted before recruitment, perhaps reflecting whether the cells originated from short-lived effector cells. a division of labor may also take place even within the lung, as CD103+DCs preferentially drive CD103 expression upon CD8+ T cell activation. CD4+ T cells produce IL-2 in response to late antigen recognition. autocrine IL-2 signaling at the memory check point improves memory CD4 T cell survival. inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) during the early phase of infection selectively impairs the formation of CD8+ TRM cells in the small intestine. some strains of influenza virus surface protein can activate latent TGF- in the lung. local TGF- signaling does not require Sma- and Mad-related protein 4 (Smad4) (51), and plays a key role in the downregulation of T-box transcription factors Eomes and T-bet in effector CD8+ T cells. IL-15 production is increased especially in cells purified from the airways and also the lung tissues following influenza virus infection. innate lymphoid cell-derived IL-27 (101,120,121) production of IL-10 is correlated with its terminal maturation. IL-10 induces activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) that promotes memory CD8+ T cell differentiation. il-10 produced by terminal effector CD8+ T cells at the memory check point may impact neighbor as well as late-comer CD8+ TRM precursors. the appearance of cytokeratin-expressing cell aggregates, known as Krt pots, is a unique hallmark of RAMDs. CD8+ TRM cells in the RAMDs do not form a specific organized structure. CD4+ TRM cells in the iBALT typically form clusters and surround B cell follicles. there is a competition among antigen-specific effector CD8+ T cells to interact with cognate APCs in the inflamed microenvironment. this competition occurs even between effector CD8+ T cells with distinct specificities when epitopes specific for those effectors are presented on the same DCs. chemokine administration results in the establishment of CD8+ TRM cells (81,113), a method known as \u201cprime-pull\u201d. basal levels of CD8+ TRM cells can be deposited in multiple nonlymphoid tissues even after systemic infection in the absence of any local antigen presentation or inflammation. a second hit with cognate antigen in the peripheral tissues plays a key role for terminal effector differentiation. a division of labor may take place even within the lung, as CD103+DCs preferentially drive CD103 expression upon CD8+ T cell activation. a second hit for terminal effector differentiation may occur a little earlier. a second hit for terminal effector differentiation may occur a little earlier. CD4+ T cells produce IL-2 in response to late antigen recognition. autocrine IL-2 signaling at the memory check point improves memory CD4 T cell survival in the spleen, MLN, and lung. inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) during early phase of infection selectively impairs the formation of CD8+ TRM cells in the small intestine. a- and Mad-related protein 4 (Smad4) plays a key role in the downregulation of T-box transcription factors Eomes and T-bet in effector CD8+ T cells. IL-15 production is increased especially in cells purified from the airways and also the lung tissues following influenza virus infection. lack of IL-15 essentially has no impact on the ultimate generation of CD8+ TRM cells in the lung. IL-10 produced by terminal effector CD8+ T cells at the memory check point may impact neighbor as well as late-comer CD8+ TRM precursors in the lung. this results in their lifelong persistence (137) CD8+ TRM cells in the RAMDs do not form a specific organized structure. CD4+ TRM cells in the iBALT typically form clusters and surround B cell follicles. there is also rigid compartmentalization between lung CD8+ TRM cells and CD8+ TEM cells. there is a competition among antigen-specific effector CD8+ T cells to interact with cognate APCs in the inflamed microenvironment (97). this competition occurs even between effector CD8+ T cells with distinct specificities when epitopes specific for those effectors are presented on the same DCs. ratios of memory CD8+ T cells recruited from the circulation to the airways peaked at only 20% by 2 weeks after parabiotic surgery. 80% are segregated from blood-born memory CD8+ T cells, just like TRM cells in other mucosal tissues. this raises a question whether the latter cell population can survive long in the harsh airway environment. CD8+ TRM cells in the lung interstitium/parenchyma and airways are maintained independent of homeostatic cytokine IL-15 (131) this is consistent with the relatively lower level of expression of IL-15 receptor on memory CD8+ T cells in the lung compared to those in the spleen (112). this is consistent with the relatively lower level of expression of IL-15 receptor on memory CD8+ T cells in the lung compared to those in the spleen (1 peribronchiolar foci remain in the lung at least a month postinfection. inflammatory responses have largely abated at this time point. the size of the RAMDs shrinks over time. reactivation of CD8+ TRM cells in the lung leads to sustained expression of interferon-induced transmembrane protein (IFITM3). reactivation of CD8+ TRM cells in the lung leads to sustained expression of interferon-induced transmembrane protein (IFITM3), which is involved in conferring resistance against subsequent virus infection (132) the efficacy of continual (basal) recruitment to the airways wanes over time (117) signature markers of TRM cells, such as CD69 and CD103, could be upregulated on lung-circulating blood-born CD8+ TEM cells in certain tissue environments (65) or basal levels of TNF secreted in the lung (117). however, it is still unclear whether TEM-derived CD69+CD103+ cells acquire certain tissue residency. only a limited number of cells in the lung airways are continually replaced by cells from the circulation. 80% of memory CD8+ T cells in the airways are new recruits. 80% are segregated from blood-born memory CD8+ T cells in the airways. cells in the lung interstitium/parenchyma and airways are maintained independent of homeostatic cytokine IL-15 (131) this is consistent with the relatively lower level of expression of IL-15 receptor on memory CD8+ T cells in the lung compared to those in the spleen (112). this is consistent with the relatively lower level of expression of IL-15 receptor on memory CD8+ T cells in the lung compared to those in the spleen (112). CD8+ TRM cells are predominantly accumulated in the RAMDs. peribronchiolar foci remain in the lung at a month postinfection. inflammatory responses have largely abated at this time point. PD-1 impairs protective efficacy of memory CD8+ T cells in the lung. reactivation of CD8+ TRM cells leads to sustained expression of interferon-induced transmembrane protein (IFITM3). reactivation of CD8+ TRM cells in the lung leads to sustained expression of interferon-induced transmembrane protein (IFITM3) a better understanding of CD8 memory in the lung is essential for the development of safe and effective vaccines capable of generating long-lasting antigen-specific memory CD8+ TRM cells. a better understanding of CD8 memory in the lung is essential for the development of safe and effective vaccines capable of generating long-lasting antigen-specific memory CD8+ TRM cells. long-term maintenance of CD8+ TRM cells in the lung and repeated tissue damage are two sides of the same coin. future study should be focused on the balance between protective efficacy and immune pathology when considering vaccines that target CD8+ TRM cells in the lung."}
