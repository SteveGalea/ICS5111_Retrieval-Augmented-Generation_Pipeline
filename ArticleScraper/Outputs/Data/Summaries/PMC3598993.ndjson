{"summary": "lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is a major cause of pediatric morbidity and mortality, especially among non-affluent communities. in this study we determine the impact of respiratory viruses and how viral co-detections/infections can affect clinical LRTI severity in children in a hospital setting. study identified a significant number of children infected by recently identified viruses, such as hMPV and Human Bocavirus (HBov) LRTIs represent an important public health burden in the first years of life accounting for approximately one fifth of all deaths in children below five years of age, especially in developing countries. LRTI was defined by the presence of signs and symptoms of an acute respiratory infection (cough, nasal discharge, oropharyngeal hyperemia, with or without fever), and lower respiratory signs (tachypnea, retractions, prolonged expiratory time, or crackles/wheezing on auscultation) children who were admitted in the ER with signs and symptoms of a LRTI for at least 6 hours were considered eligible, once symptoms had started within the previous 5 days. vital signs, respiratory distress were obtained from the medical charts. information on use of medications, clinical course of the disease until discharge, use of supplemental oxygen, and length of hospital stay were prospectively collected. sample size was estimated based on few previous similar studies. qPCR assays were performed using 3 L of the DNA extraction or cDNA (approximately 150 ng), 0.33 pmoles for primers, 0.17 pmoles for probes and 7.5 L of master mix of TaqMan\u00ae. all variables with a significance of p 0.15 were considered in the univariate models. LRTI was defined by the presence of signs and symptoms of an acute respiratory infection (cough, nasal discharge, oropharyngeal hyperemia, with or without fever), and lower respiratory signs (tachypnea, retractions, prolonged expiratory time, or crackles/wheezing on auscultation) children who were admitted in the ER with signs and symptoms of a LRTI for at least 6 hours were considered eligible, once symptoms had started within the previous 5 days. supplemental oxygen was withdrawn when pulse oximetry was equal or greater than 94% in room air for at least 6 hours, as this is the standard clinical procedure in the hospital. sample size was estimated based on few previous similar studies. the qPCR assays were performed using 3 L of the DNA extraction or cDNA (approximately 150 ng), 0.33 pmoles for primers, 0.17 pmoles for probes and 7.5 L of master mix of TaqMan\u00ae (Applied Biosystems) the qPCR assays were performed using 3 L of the DNA extraction or cDNA (approximately 150 ng) in the whole sample there were more boys than girls, almost half of children were younger than six months, 24% of all children were born premature, 29% had been exposed to tobacco during gestation. the most common single infection was related to RSV (54%), followed by hMPV (32%), and HRV (21%). RSV has shown an incidence peak in the beginning of the cold season (i.e. from april to November) in the southern hemisphere, followed in late winter by peaks of hMPV, HRV, and HBov. other viruses such as HPIV and human Adenovirus (HAdv) showed low but constant rates throughout the season. infants with HRV-LRTIs stayed an extra 2.2 days in hospital (p = 0.011), for a total of 7.7 (95% CI: 6.1-9.3) days when compared to those with other infections. infants with combined HRV and RSV positive PCR in the same samples stayed 4.5 extra days (p = 0.004) than those without HRV and RSV. time in use of supplemental oxygen followed the same association trends. 6.5 (5.5 - 7.4) -0.2 (-1.4 - 1.0) 0.749 Maternal smoking 6.8 (5.6 - 8.2) 6.3 (5.3 - 7.2) 0.6 (-0.6 - 1.8) 0.354 Hx: history; * number of extra days in hospital, compared to negative counterparts. study shows infants with severe LRTI and positive PCR for HRV stayed hospitalized longer periods. infants younger than six months and those with a family history of asthma/recurrent wheeze are also at greater risk for disease severity. a recent study of children admitted to the hospital due to acute bronchiolitis has shown a steady increase in admissions over a 5-year period. this increased role for severe viral LRTIs is probably explained by a series of complex environmental and social changes that seem to affect how viruses spread in communities. some studies have reported different clinical outcomes for specific viruses causing LRTIs, especially in the presence of co-detections. the association between HRV (alone or with RSV) with LRTI severity and atopy has not been widely studied. a recent study suggests that the relationship between HRV in early life LRTI and subsequent recurrent wheeze/asthma is dependent on allergic sensitization. this association is a major finding. only 2/27 patients with HBov had this virus detected as single agent. the overall HBov detection rate was higher in our data compared to previous studies. the main limitation of our study is the lack of surveillance in consecutive years.
