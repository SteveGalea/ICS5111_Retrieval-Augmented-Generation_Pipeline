{"summary": "new influenza A viruses pose a significant threat of a pandemic. vaccines and antivirals are used for control of influenza. emerging virus resistance to these measures presents limitations. alternative control measures need to be urgently considered. human-to-human transmission of avian influenza virus is relatively rare. four pandemics have occurred since the start of the 20th century. four pandemics have occurred since the start of the 20th century. effective strategies to combat influenza pandemics involve both the generation of broad-spectrum immunity and protection from immunopathology. vaccines with strain matching are developed on an annual basis. recombinant DNA plasmid-based and virus-like particle vaccines are alternative options. antiviral development has targeted specific oligosaccharide-comprised sites on enveloped viruses (cyanovirin) [21], viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase (favipiravir) [22], and their possible combination targeting different stages of the virus replication cycle. innovative drugs may offer future clinical benefits including (DAS181) that mediates cleavage of sialic acid from host glycan receptors [24], -defensins and antiviral IFNs are the best characterized of the type I IFN family. they are comprised of IFN- (1\u201314 subtypes), beta, tau, epsilon, omega, and many more. but influenza viruses can evade innate immunity in part through the nonstructural- (NS-) 1 protein, targeting interferon regulatory factor- (IRF-) 3, blocking IFN promoter activity. IFNs can also affect immune cell proliferation, differentiation, maturation, migration, and survival. each protein of the type I IFN family binds a single type of cell surface receptor (IFNAR), the binding affinities and downstream signaling pathways differ. differential efficacies have been found for individual IFN subtypes in mouse models of influenza. the type III IFN-lambda family was found to induce similar antiviral effects to the type I IFNs except for their cell-restriction and signaling mainly in epithelial cells and hepatocytes. both IFN-/ and IFN- have been shown to be important for control of influenza in experimental animal models utilizing double receptor knockout mice. antibodies blocking binding of viral HA proteins to cell surface receptors directly neutralize the virus and prevent virus entry. the spread of virus to neighboring cells is inhibited, virus shedding is reduced, and the infection cleared through a combined antibody and effector T cell response. convalescent plasma treatment was deemed effective for H5N1-infected individuals in china [64] and for the pandemic H1N1 in Hong Kong [65]. a relatively low titre of anti-HA antibody in convalescent plasma (HAI titer 128) protected 100% ferrets from a fatal HPAI H5N1 virus infection when passively transferred 24 hours before virus challenge. monoclonal neutralizing antibodies cross protective against H1, H2, H5, H6, and H9 influenza virus strains were recovered from human IgM+ memory B cells [72] monoclonal antibodies cross protective against H1, H2, H5, and H9 influenza virus strains were also identified with broad-spectrum prophylactic efficacy against HPAI H5N1 virus strains. selective regions of the head and stalk domains of the HA molecule are highly conserved and can induce cross protective antibody responses. as the HA head is immunodominant, stalk antigens have relatively low immunogenicity and do not stimulate large amounts of highly reactive antibodies with classical vaccine regimes. however, broadly neutralizing high affinity antibodies could potentially be prepared in animals with immune manipulation using modified vaccine regimes. antibody-based passive immunity is a powerful prophylactic strategy for influenza pandemic control, reducing the risk of virus spread in populations. the dairy industry infrastructure in some countries provides an opportunity for bulk antibody production in large ruminants. an immunoprophylaxis option would also be particularly important for those who have been previously vaccinated with seasonal influenza. prophylaxis could protect against both morbidity and mortality rates. effective passive immunity is important to provide coverage during the first wave or six-month risk period of the pandemic while an effective vaccine is developed for the identified virus to induce active immunity. antistalk antibody isotypes and subclasses generated in immunized donor animals are required to increase knowledge of optimal efficacy and cross protection against clades spanning H1, H3, H7 and H9 virus types. passive immunoprophylaxis would have benefits of immediate short-term protection, especially of benefit to the elderly and very young ones, who have poorer antibody responses to vaccination."}
