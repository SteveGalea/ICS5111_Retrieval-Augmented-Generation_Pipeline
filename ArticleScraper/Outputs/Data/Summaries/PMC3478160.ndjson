{"summary": "Fusarium graminearum virus 1 strain-DK21 (FgV1-DK21) is a mycovirus that confers hypovirulence to F. graminearum. this is the primary phytopathogenic fungus that causes Fusarium head blight (FHB) disease in cereals. Fusarium graminearum (teleomorph Gibberella zeae) is a well known phytopathogenic fungus associated with Fusarium head blight (FHB) disease. the fungus causes root rots, root rots, or wilts, especially in economically important cereal crops such as wheat, maize, and barley. inearum virus 1 strain-DK21 (FgV1-DK21) exhibits interesting phenotypes including reduced mycelial growth and the induction of dark red pigmentation. a recent study demonstrated that protoplast fusion is the most efficient approach for transmitting mycoviruses among a wide range of phytopathogenic fungi. cDNA microarrays containing 2,200 genes showed transcriptional change in G-signaling pathways following hypovirus infections showing different virulence or phenotypes. this is the first report of a genome-wide fungal gene expression analysis during mycovirus infection using a 3\u2032 tiling microarray. a total of 1775 genes, representing 13.3% of 13,382 genes, were differentially expressed at both time points (Figure 2C), with 1109 (5.4%) and 1050 genes (5%) identified as differentially expressed at both time points (Figure 2C). aRadial growth was measured on PDA 120 h after inoculation. new tab Differentially expressed genes during inoculation with FgV1-DK21. all signal intensities were converted to a log10 scale. diagonal lines indicate a two-fold change. the 33 genes belonging to group B were highly induced at 36 h. group C included 120 genes that were strongly repressed regardless of virus infection time. group D contained 195 genes that showed consistently elevated gene expression across both time points. 0.011883416 36 h FGSG_04468 Amino acid transporter permease 4.672200299 0.012719315 120 h FGSG_08055 Amino acid transporter permease 4.288189196 0.013683756 120 h FGSG_03788 Glyco_hydrolase_16 4.044638062 0.013683756 120 h FGSG_05076 ABC transporter 3.965527131 genes that showed diverse expression patterns were categorized into different functional classes. the results of the qRT-PCR were highly consistent with those of the microarray data. qRT-PCR offers a highly sensitive technique for detecting low amounts of transcripts. 20 genes showed strong expression ratios by microarray analysis. expression intensities less than 4 (A), between 4 and 100 (B) and more than 100 (C) abbreviations: VF, virus-free; VI, virus-infected. the number in the table indicates the expression intensity of each gene. genes associated with the cell cycle and DNA processing (21 genes), transcription (46 genes), protein synthesis (35 genes), protein fate (18 genes), and those encoding proteins with binding function (81 genes) were highly up-regulated at 36 h. the number of down-regulated genes associated with cellular transport at 36 h was almost twice that of up-regulated genes at 120 h. enriched gene ontology (GO) terms of differentially expressed genes are listed in Additional file 5: Table S5. enriched GO terms are listed in Additional file 5: Table S5. ribonucleoprotein complex biogenesis (GO: 0022613) and ribosome biogenesis (GO: 0042254) were highly over-represented.

RNA viruses have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to achieve replication efficiently during virus infection and replication. ribosomes are indirectly involved in the replication of dsRNA viruses. the system for dsRNA viruses might differ from that of ssRNA viruses. gene expression associated with metabolic pathways plays a critical role. the down-regulation of genes involved in polyamine biosynthesis during the early stage (36 h) could be correlated with reduced levels of DON, which confers hypovirulence to host F. graminearum. a previous study showed that polyamine biosynthesis inhibitors decreased mycelial growth of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum[42]. plasma membranes are the first barriers to block pathogen attack. a previous study suggested that virus infection causes depolarization of the host cell membranes. this suggests that all materials required for virus replication should be recruited within the host cell. cAMP signaling is implicated in the regulation of hyphal growth, mating, and gluconeogenesis in many fungi. cAMP signaling is implicated in the regulation of hyphal growth, mating, and gluconeogenesis in many fungi. dsRNA viruses rely on host cell machinery and have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to achieve replication efficiently during virus infection. the nucleolus produces numerous ribosomes to maximize viral replication. ribosomes are indirectly involved in the replication of dsRNA viruses. our results, as well as a previous report of C. parasitica, found dramatic differences in gene expression associated with metabolic pathways. the majority of metabolites, including lipids and carbohydrates, were significantly accumulated with increasing infection time. this difference may be due to different infection times. inhibitors decreased mycelial growth of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum[42]. this result is consistent with observed phenotypes in virus-infected F. graminearum showing strong inhibition of mycelia growth. however, we do not know whether the inhibition of mycelial growth in F. graminearum is directly related to polyamine biosynthesis. the Zn2Cys6 family is the largest TF family in F. graminearum. of the nine TFs that were differentially expressed at both the early and late time points, six belong to the Zn2Cys6 family. to characterize the functional roles of the host TFs associated with hypovirulence, it is necessary to examine the phenotype of knock-out mutant lines. cAMP and the G-protein alpha subunit coordinate their activities to regulate differentiation and virulence in some fungi. this result is consistent with previous data that suggested up-regulation of cAMP levels in the fungal transcriptome by hypovirus infection. genes involved in various metabolic pathways, particularly those that produce carboxylic acids, aromatic amino acids, nitrogen compounds, and polyamines, were highly down-regulated at the early time point (36 h). these results suggest that FgV1-DK21 suppresses the production of such defense-related components until the transcriptional and translational machinery in host cells have adjusted to FgV1-DK21 replication. virus-free and FgV1-DK21-infected strains were harvested in 50 ml of CMC broth at 4 days after inoculation. three replicates were used for this treatment. mycotoxin was extracted from the isolates and analyzed with a gas chromatograph\u2013mass spectrometer. the genome contains a total of 13,382 genes. 133,612 probes were designed. average probe size was 60 nucleotides long. the reaction was stopped by heating at 70\u00b0C for 10 min. the second strand was 66.7 l nuclease free water. the reaction was performed at 15\u00b0C for 2 h. a 10 g aliqout of DNA was used for microarray hybridization. the sample was mixed with 19.5 l 2 X hybridization buffer. the microarray was removed from the MAUI Hybridization Station. a probe-level summarization was performed using a median polish algorithm implemented in NimbleScan. the multiple correction analysis was performed using the limma package in an R computing environment. genes for which the adjusted P-value or false discovery rate was below 0.05 were collected and further selected. qRT-PCR analysis qRT-PCR was performed on bio-Rad\u2019s CFX96TM Real-time PCR system using gene-specific internal primers. each reaction mix (10 l) consisted of 25 ng total cDNA, 5 l 2 X SsoFastTM EvaGreen\u00ae Supermix (Bio-Rad, USA), and 10 pmoles each primer.
