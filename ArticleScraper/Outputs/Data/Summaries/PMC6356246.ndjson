{"summary": "alpha-, beta-, and gamma-coronavirus are classified into three well-accepted genera. deltacoronavirus is proposed as an additional group in the family. gammacoronaviruses, represented by the infectious bronchitis virus, are detected primarily in birds including poultry. the wild birds are important reservoirs for avian influenza A virus [13], and may be for other respiratory and enteric viruses. in recent years, ACoVs have been isolated from various wild bird species that create a suspicion that wild birds play a role as CoV reservoirs and as ACoV carrier influencing its epidemiology. screening and downstream characterization and evolutionary analysis confirm the circulation of ACoVs in wild birds. understanding dynamics and richness of wilds birds in carrying avian pathogens will be steppingstone in devising any disease control and eradication campaign in the country. dakahlia Kafr El Sheikh Gharbia Qalubia Menofia Giza Benisuef Total C. coturnix 23 21 20 22 23 15 7 9 140 P. domesticus 22 20 23 18 17 14 12 10 136 A. crecca 23 22 19 21 20 18 13 14 150 B. ibis 23 20 18 21 19 11 9 10 131 Total 91 83 80 82 79 58 41 43 557 Positive (n) 3 1 4 2 2 1 92% 11 92% 92% 92% 92% 92% 92% 92% 92% 100% 100% 99% ID 100% 92% 92% 92% 92% 92% 92% 92% 92% 92% 92% 92% 92% 100% 99% 100% ID 92% 92% 12 92% 92% 92% 92% 92% 92% 92% 92% 92% 92% 92% 92% 100% 99% 100% ID 92% 92% 12 92% 92% 92% 92% 92% 92% 92% 92% 92% 92% polymerase (RdRp) and Spike (S1) genes Amplification and Sequencing Viral RNA was extracted from the allantoic fluids using the Trizol LS\u00ae reagent kit. the eluted RNA in 30 L of nuclease free water was stored at (70 \u00b0C) until processing for the amplification. analysis of full length S1 protein was carried out using bioEdit software version 7.0.4.1 [23]. the dataset was aligned in BioEdit version 7.0.1 [23] using Clustal W algorithm. a best-fit model was chosen on which further calculations were based. a total of five hundred- fifty-seven (n = 557) cloacal/fecal swabs were collected from randomly-selected wild birds-dense and ACoV-endemic areas in eight Egyptian provinces during the year of 2016. samples were blindly propagated for three passages in the allantoic sac of 9 day-old specific pathogen free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs by standard procedures. ibis 7 150 4.7 Pelecaniformes Ardeidae Bubulcus B. ibis 4 131 3.1 Total = 4 4 4 4 14 557 2.5 Table 2.

N-linked glycosylation sites in most of the Egyptian ACoV strains were found. nine NXT and eight NXS sites were found in all the 14 isolates reported in this study. compared hypervariable regions

phylogenetic analysis based on S1 gene of the ACoVs collected from Egypt and rest of the world revealed that all detected viruses belonged to gamma-coronaviruses. a higher resolution analysis of Egyptian ACoVs reported in this study revealed that five isolates (MF034379.1 ACoV/quail/Sharqia-Egypt/VRLCU-8/2016, MF034380.1 ACoV/cattle e Egypt/VRLCU-2/2016, MF034374.1 ACoV/teal/Dakahlia

replications of bootstrap re-sampling of the originally aligned nucleotide sequences. scale bar represents the number of substitutions per site. the year of isolation and geographical origin of the virus sequences are included. cumulative difference between non-synonymous substitution rate (dN) and synonymous substitution rate (dS) revealed positive selection along the spike (S1) protein while negative and neutral selection was also detected. a number of possible recombination sites were identified. a total of 557 samples were collected from randomly selected wild birds dense and ACoV endemic areas from eight provinces. from this screening, 2.5% positive rate (14 out of 557) was detected among all tested fecal/cloacal samples. up on S1 gene revealed that the fourteen isolates were 92\u2013100% identity percentage. in 2001, an Egyptian variant I strain (Egypt/Beni-Suef/01) was reported in different poultry farms. another variant was also identified in 2011 and designated as Egyptian variant II. teal/Dakahlia -Egypt/VRLCU-3..Q.Q..A.A.YWSKNFSS.A.V.....QN..SSS.S..L...IP.YY.I...R.NS Y..SN.H..NG..HT.SL. cattle egret/Kafr El Sheikh-Egypt/VRLCU-7..Q.Q.Q.

that five isolates (MF034379.1 ACoV/quail/Sharqia-Egypt/VRLCU-8/2016,MF034380.1 ACoV/cattle t/VRLCU-10/2016, MF034382.1 ACoV/teal/Benisuef-Egypt/VRLCU-11/2016 and MF034383.1 ACoV/cattle egret/Kafr El Sheikh-Egypt/VRLCU-12/2016 were closely related to Egy/Variant 1 of IS/1494/06 genotype origin. previously isolated Egyptian viruses (ck/Eg/B Egy/variant 1 and Egy/variant 2 groups were phylogenetically subclassified into subgroups/subclusters (Figure 4) based on ACoVs emergence, origin, and evolution. the detected viruses in this study belonged to gamma-coronaviruses. trees

the S1 subunit have three HVRs, located within amino acids 38\u201367, 91\u2013141, and 274\u2013387 [3,4,5] and these HVRs were considered an essential determinant of coronavirus serotype specificity. evidence that wild birds might constitute transmission vectors for ACoVs even in a huge geographic territory. the number of samples analyzed in this study was limited. it can be assumed that the genetic variation of ACoVs among wild birds is much higher than previously thought. most of ACoVs available on GenBank are divided into variant and classic groups. the majority of the Egyptian ACoV strains belong to QX-like, 4/91, IS/1494/06 (Egy/Variant-1) and IS/885 (Egy/Variant-2) genotypes. emergence of Egy/variant 1 (IS/1494/06-like) and Egy/variant 2 (IS/885-like) in Egypt has been introduced to the poultry population raises several speculations. recombination events in the ACoV genome play a major role in the origin and adaptation of the virus. many recombination events have been reported in different ACoV strains, not only between field (wild-type) and vaccine viruses but also among field viruses within the same genotype (intra-genotypic) or between different genotypes (inter-genotypic) [41,40], giving rise to new ACoV genotypes. positively selected fragments of genes encoding viral proteins have been documented in other viruses. there is an association between positively selected sites along the S1 subunit identified in this study and mapped neutralizing epitopes. full genome sequencing will provide detailed information on different subgroups. this would require comprehensive data through better surveillance of wild birds."}
