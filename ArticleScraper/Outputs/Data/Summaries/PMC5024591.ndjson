{"summary": "nasal swabs were obtained from 1,033 dromedary camels in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) and Kenya. all specimens were tested for HCoV-229E\u2013related CoVs by a real-time RT-PCR assay capable of detecting HCoV-229E, ACoV, and genetically distant 229E-related bat CoVs. younger animals had lower seroprevalence rates compared to older animals. dromedaries from KSA tested positive for HCoV-229E\u2013related CoV. dromedaries tested positive for both coVs (3.5%). four of 17 samples produced a CPE 2\u20133 d postinoculation on HuH-7 and Caki-3 cells. CPE formation and cell death were consistently observed 1 d earlier on Caki-3 cells than on HuH-7 cells. Isolation was successful down to viral RNA concentrations of ca. 1 106 copies per milliliter. dromedaries are infected with HCoV-229E inf-1 and two dromedary-derived HCoV-229E\u2013related viruses. dromedaries can be infected with MERS-CoV in presence of high antibody titers in sera (23) all sera from dromedaries yielding virus isolates were tested by IFA using HEK-293 cells that express the HCoV-229E spike protein from a e the full genomes of five HCoV-229E\u2013related dromedary CoVs were determined by combined next-generation sequencing and Sanger sequencing approaches. human viruses included strains isolated 46 y ago (reference strain inf-1), 23 y ago (strain USA/993-50/1993), 6 y ago (strain 0349/NED/2010), and 1 y ago (HCoV-229E/BN1/GER/2015) phylogeny of HCoV-229E\u2013related CoVs. nodes illustrate posterior probabilities.

Discussion Here, we characterize a diverse group of al dromedary-associated viruses differ from a larger viral diversity in bats. phylogeny does not allow differentiation between an ancient acquisition of human viruses from camelids and an acquisition by both hosts from a common source. dromedary viruses contain at least two different ORF8 versions. a direct acquisition from a bat reservoir is unlikely because ORF8 genes with the signature deletion have not been found in bats. a gradual deletion of an accessory gene of unknown function was also observed for the SARS-CoV after transition to humans during the middle and late phases of the SARS epidemic. experimental infection studies will be necessary to understand symptoms caused by 229E infection in camelids and alpacas. the observed virus concentrations are in the same range as concentrations observed for MERS-CoV (33, 37), which should suffice to infect humans. dromedary-associated 229E viruses could pose a threat to humans. the primordial virus acquisition in humans would have met an immunologically naive human population in which limited onward transmission may have been established easier, leading to adaptive changes and an optimization of viral traits facilitating transmission. our findings raise a scenario for the emergence of a human respiratory virus. all animals were handled according to national and european legislation. work at the ILRI complies with the United Kingdom\u2019s Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act of 1986. amplification and sequencing were done using sets of nested RT-PCR assays. next-generation sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq instrument. sera were tested by a recombinant HCoV-229E spike protein IFA. two live-virus isolates of the dromedary-derived 229E-related viruses were used for the in vitro experiments. for comparison, strain HCoV-229E inf-1 (44) and a low-passage (passage 3) wild-type (wt) isolate of HCoV-229E were used for the in vitro experiments. cells were infected with HCoV-229E inf-1, HCoV-229E wt, ACN4 and JCN50 in triplicate with an MOI of 0.5 plaque-forming units per cell. supernatants were harvested 24, 48, 72, and 96 hpi and quantified by real-time RT-PCR. coV229E-sgRNA-rtF, CTT AAG TRY CTT ATC TAT CTA YAG ATA G, coV229E_sgRNA_N_rtR, CCA ACT WAA AAM CAC AYA CAA ACC A. assays used the SSIII RT-PCR kit (Life Technologies) with 400 nM concentrations of each of the primers, as well as 200 nM probes. one hundred plaque-forming units of each virus were preincubated in parallel with diluted serum for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. cells were fixed with formalin, stained, and assessed for the presence of CPEs. all protocols of this study were designed and performed in strict accordance with the Kenyan legislation for animal experimentation. the contemporary human isolate of HCoV-229E was taken from and by coauthor I.E. during an episode of acute rhinitis. no animals were killed as part of this study. human hepatoma, veroE6 (monkey kidney), caco-2 (human colon carcinoma), Caki-3 (dromedary kidney), and LGK-1-R.B (alpaca kidney) were used for virus isolation. two live-virus isolates of the dromedary-derived 229E-related viruses, termed ACN4 and JCN50, were used for the in vitro experiments. a concentration of 100 IU/mL, 1,000 IU/mL, or no IFN (untreated) 16 h prior to infection in triplicate with HCoV-229E, ACN4 and JCN50 at an MOI of 0.1 pfu/mL. after a 1-h incubation, the supernatant was removed and cells were washed twice with PBS. the human embryonic kidney cell line HEK-293T was transformed by lent supernatants were harvested 24, 48, 72, and 96 hpi and quantified by real-time RT-PCR. tests for sgRNA of N and the camel ORF8 protein used a leader-specific primer (CoV229E-sgRNA-rtF), primers and probes targeting sequences downstream of the start codons of the respective ORFs. HuH-7 cells were seeded in a 96-well plate 1 d before infection. one hundred plaque-forming units of each virus were preincubated in parallel with diluted serum for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C."}
