{"summary": "human bocavirus (HBoV) is a virus belonging to the Parvoviridae family. it caused the death of a 5-month-old girl with a history of high fever and wheezing. postmortem microbiology is useful in both clinical and forensic autopsies. the patient was readmitted to the hospital 3 days ago with complaints of high fever and wheezing. she was sent home after treatment for acute bronchiolitis was planned. internal examination showed enlarged ventricles, a soft consistency of her brain, pink-colored white matter, intensive cerebellar congestion, and enlargement of the meningeal arteries. human Bocavirus (HBoV 1/2/3/4) was found to be positive in nasopharyngeal swabs and stool samples using a multiplex PCR method. rotavirus and adenovirus antigen tests and analysis of the Clostridium difficile A/B toxin were found to be negative. spleen, brain, cerebellum, brain stem, pancreas and salivary gland tissues were examined during histopathological evaluation. there were no remarkable histopathological findings in other organs. death of the baby, whose fever did not decrease during the last period, was due to respiratory failure associated with pulmonary infection. bronchiolitis, respiratory distress and cough were cited as the most common respiratory symptoms. bronchiolitis is a predisposing factor for HBoV and may cause co-infections. HBoV positivity was detected in tracheal aspirate and serum samples. the clinical condition of the patient improved after treatment. respiratory distress developed rapidly following complaints of nasal flow, fever and cough. multidisciplinary studies where microbiologists, pathologists and forensic medicine experts take part would increase the success of postmortem microbiology. HBoV is associated with life-threatening acute respiratory tract diseases with a severe prognosis, especially in children."}
