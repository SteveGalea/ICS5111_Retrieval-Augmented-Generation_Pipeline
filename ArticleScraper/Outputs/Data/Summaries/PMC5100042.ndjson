{"summary": "a 7 yr old boy was referred to our hospital with the history of \u2018fever\u2019, \u2018pharyngitis\u2019, and \u2018reduced level of consciousness\u2019. he had had fever, sore throat, headache, lymphadenopathy of back of the neck, skin exanthema, pharyngitis and post nasal drip. he developed status epilepticus with mixed type seizure. blood work results were as follows: white blood cells: 1900/l, neutrophils: 55% (absolute neutrophil count=1045), lymphocyte= 45%, hemoglobin=10.9 gr/deciliter, platelet=104000/ l, blood urea nitrogen (BUN)= 11 mg/ deciliter, creatinine= 0.7 mg/ deciliter, lactate dehydrogenase= 1047 IU/l (normal range up to 746), AST= 60 U hypotension caused by side effects of antiepileptic drugs, norepinephrine 0.05 microgram/kg/min started and echocardiography performed. mannitol infusion and other measures for cerebral edema were administered. the super refractory seizure was not controlled, midazolam discontinued, and pyridoxine (100 mg intravenous daily), chloral hydrate (15 cc/4 h via enteral route from the 1% solution), topiramate (increased to 50 mg twice a day), thiopental, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and levetiracetam started. the probable diagnoses were considered autoimmune encephalitis or infectious-related epil magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in FLAIR sequence on the 50th day of admission revealed 'abnormal right parietal corticosubcortical high signal' During his long stay he sustained the problems of prolonged hospitalization such as nosocomial blood stream infection, gastric content pulmonary aspiration, drug induced neutropenia, tracheal tube dislocation and intubation and extubation procedures. pyridoxine (day 4 to \u2018discharged with\u2019), levetiracetam (day 4 to \u2018discharged with\u2019), thiopental (day 4 to 7),chloral hydrate (day 4 to 10), diazepam (day 4 to 35 as continuous infusion and intermittent doses), vigabatrin (day 5 to 63), ketamine infusion (day 8 to 15), and carbamazepin (day 28 to 52) on the day status epilepticus is defined as superrefractory status epilepticus. encephalopathies or another central nervous (CNS) infection should be considered when the patient has a group of symptoms of recent febrile illness. autoimmune encephalitis is a group of disorders associated with antibodies against the surface proteins of neuronal cells and synaptic receptors. nonspecific viral infections may lead to breaking immune tolerance and increase the possibility of antibodies to enter the CNS. systemic infection with influenza virus can cause seizure provoked by fever and systemic illness, extrapyramidal syndromes, Guillain-Barre syndrome, encephalitis and transverse myelitis. there has been no evidence supporting the benefits of antiviral treatment for neurologic course of the disease. human herpes virus type 6 is a common viral illness in childhood. autoimmune encephalitis was considered because of the refractory course. the antibodies\u2019panel of cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) was negative and no response seen to high dose of methylprednisolone and intravenous immunoglobulin administration."}
