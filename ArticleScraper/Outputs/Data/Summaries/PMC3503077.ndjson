{"summary": "TEXT Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) belongs to the genus of the Bunyaviridae family. its negative-stranded tripartite RNA genome is encapsidated by nucleocapsid protein. it is surrounded by a lipid-containing envelope which is derived from the trans-Golgi network (36) beta3 integrins and nucleolin have been reported to be involved in attachment of hantavirus and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus. DC-SIGN, a C-type lectin primarily restricted to interstitial dendritic cells and certain tissue macrophages, has been identified as a receptor for some phleboviruses. s are incapable of synthesizing complex N-linked glycans. the CHO lec2 mutant cells express sialic acid-free N- and O-linked glycans. the pgsA-745 cell mutant (10) is deficient in the synthesis of GAGs. cells were triedpsinized and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde\u2013PBS for 20 min at room temperature. RVFVns-infected (GFP-positive) cells were quantified by FACS (FACSCalibur) preincubation of RVFVns with heparin reduced infection of CHO cells. no effect of chondroitinase treatment was observed for VSVns. chondroitinase ABC (specific for chondroitin and dermatan sulfate), heparinase I (specific for heparin and highly sulfated domains), and heparinase III (specific for heparan sulfate) were dissolved in resuspension buffer (20 mM HEPES [pH 7.5], 50 mM NaCl, 4 mM CaCl2, CHO K1 cells were subjected to passage in the presence of 50 mM sodium chlorate (NaClO3). NaClO3 is known to inhibit the addition of O-sulfate groups to GAGs. infection by RVFVns of CHO K1 or A549 cells maintained in the presence of NaClO3 was dramatically reduced. or A549 cells were subjected to two passages in culture medium containing 50 mM NaClO3 (Sigma) or in chlorate-free culture medium [NaClO3 ()] for 8 h prior to inoculation with RVFVns or VSVns at the indicated MOI. at 8 (VSVns) or 20 (RVFVns) h p.i., cells were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy CHO cells were inoculated with RVFVns, VSVns, or RVFVGFP. at 8 (VSVns), 10 (RVFVGFP), or 20 (RVFVns) h p.i., cells were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. significant differences between conditions are indicated. HS dependency has for some viruses been shown to be acquired after repetitive virus passage in cell culture. the RVFV 35/74 strain was isolated from the liver of a sheep that died during an RVFV outbreak in the Free State province of south africa in 1974."}
