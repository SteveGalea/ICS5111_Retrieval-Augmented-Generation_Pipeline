{"summary": "the novel avian influenza viruses and the MERS coronavirus are associated with high mortality rates of over 30%. early detection is also important for infection control and public health measures. sputum was negative in 25% of adult patients with sputum positive for respiratory viruses. many patients do not have sputum production or cannot expectorate good quality sputum. saliva is rarely used for the detection of respiratory viruses because it is generally considered to have inferior sensitivity compared with other respiratory tract specimens. the current study was designed to enable the easy application of our saliva specimen collection method to any clinical setting. participants provided saliva specimens by simple expectoration into a sterile bottle without using special collection devices. written informed consent was obtained from all study participants. aRoutine clinical testing was performed using antigen detection by the DFA. bPatients whose NPA specimens either tested negative for respiratory viruses by DFA or had insufficient nasopharyngeal columnar epithelial cells. urine samples were collected in viral transport medium (VTM) as described previously. qRT-PCR for influenza A virus detection was carried out using superscript III Platinum One-Step RT-PCR reagents. the thermal cycling conditions were 30 min at 50 \u00b0C for reverse transcription, 2 min at 95 \u00b0C for RT inactivation/initial denaturation, and 50 cycles of 15 s at 95 \u00b0C and 45 s at 55 \u00b0C. all reactions were performed using the StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) PCR was performed using the NxTAG Respiratory Pathogen Panel (IVD) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. the multiplex PCR panel for respiratory viruses was performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. the reaction product was amplified via RT-PCR. the reaction product underwent bead hybridization within the sealed reaction well. the hybridized and tagged beads were read on the MAGPIX instrument. the first part of the study consisted of patients whose NPA samples tested positive for respiratory viruses by DFA or the influenza A virus M gene by real-time RT-PCR. the viral load was determined in both the NPA and the saliva samples using quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) multiplex PCR was used to test for respiratory viruses in both the NPA and saliva samples. data collection Patient data concerning demographics, underlying diseases, clinical findings and radiological changes were recorded in a predesigned database. qRT-PCR for influenza A virus detection was carried out using the easyMAG instrument. the reagent mixture (25 L) contained 1 RT-PCR Buffer, 1 RT-PCR Enzyme Mix, 0.12 M of the probe and 5 L of TNA as the template. the thermal cycling conditions were 10 min at 45 \u00b0C for reverse transcription, 10 min at 95 \u00b0C for RT inactivation/initial denaturation, and 50 cycles of 15 s at 95 \u00b0C and 45 s at 55 \u00b0C. all reactions were performed using the LightCycler 96 Real-Time PCR System (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) TCCAT Probe FAM- CCTCCCATTCCGCTGTGTTCAATRTACTT -IABkFQ Parainfluenza virus type 3 Forward AGCTATYACTAGYATCTCTCAGGGT -IABkFQ Multiplex PCR panel for respiratory viruses. the reaction product underwent bead hybridization within the sealed reaction well. log-transformed data were used for statistical calculations of the viral load. the first cohort consisted of 159 patients with known respiratory virus infection. median age was 69 years, with a range from 20 to 98 years. no significant difference in the median viral load was detected in the saliva specimens between patients with pneumonia and those without pneumonia. a routine clinical testing was performed using quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR for influenza A gene. eighty-four patients were infected with H3 subtype. 15 patients were infected with H1 subtype. at least one respiratory virus was detected in 22.2% of the patients. at least one respiratory virus was detected in 14.1% (14/99) and 16.2% (16/99) of the patients. at least one respiratory virus was detected in 14.1% (14/99) and 16.2% (16/99) of the NPA and the saliva samples. rhinovirus, parainfluenza viruses 1-4, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, coronaviruses HKU1, NL63, 229E and OC43, and human bocavirus. for one patient, enterovirus/rhinovirus was detected in both NPA and saliva, but human metapneumovirus was detected in saliva only. lamydophila pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were excluded from the analysis. two patients had more than one respiratory virus detected. atypical bacterial pathogens were excluded from the analysis. influenza A H3 Neuraminidase inhibitor 4 F/81 Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, IFG Rhinorrhea, cough, dyspnea, wheeze. pneumonia Negativeb hMPV Contact precaution 6 M/55 Schizophrenia, gout, CVA Fever, productive cough. the median age was 69 years, with a range from 20 to 98 years. most of the saliva specimens were collected 2 days after the collection of the NPA sample. the saliva sample was positive by qRT-PCR in 11 out of these 12 patients. virus number of patients with the virus detected in the NPA during routine clinical testinga Saliva-positive, number (%) Higher viral load in saliva than in NPA, number (%) Influenza A virus 99b,c 95 (96.0) 17 (17.2) Respiratory syncytial virus 18 15 (83.3) 1 (5.6) Human metapneumovirus 14 11 (78.6) 2 (14.3) influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza virus types 1\u20133, respiratory syncytial virus, d The denominator includes those patients for which their saliva specimens were tested negative for respiratory viruses. this is because these patients may have a low quantity of respiratory virus present in their saliva specimens but below the detection limit of the assay. eighty-three patients (83.8%) showed complete concordance, with the multiplex PCR on the NPA and the saliva samples showing the presence or absence of exactly the same respiratory viruses. for one patient, enterovirus/rhinovirus was detected in both NPA and saliva. human metapneumovirus and respiratory syncytial virus A were detected in both NPA and saliva, but coronavirus 229E was detected in NPA only. two patients had more than one respiratory virus detected. piratory viruses were detected in the saliva specimens of 8 (9.4%) of the 85 patients whose NPA specimens tested negative by the NxTAG Respiratory Pathogen Panel. piratory viruses were detected in the saliva specimens of 8 (9.4%) of the 85 patients whose NPA specimens tested negative by the NxTAG Respiratory Pathogen Panel. a patient had an additional virus species detected in her saliva. pneumonia Negativec hMPV Contact precaution 7 M/63 Asthma, Churg-Strauss syndrome Productive cough, dyspnea; asthmatic attack Negativeb EV/RV Nil 8 F/63 Stage IV lymphoma, hypertension, asthma Fever, productive cough, chills; upper respiratory tract infection Negativeb EV/RV Nil 9 M/79 Ischemic heart disease, diabetic nephropathy. saliva specimens tested positive in eight (9.4%) of the 85 patients whose NPA specimens tested negative by multiplex PCR. one patient (7.1%) had an additional respiratory virus detected in her saliva specimen using multiplex PCR. saliva collected later may have a lower viral load. the detection rate in saliva was 91.8% (146/159) in the first part of the study. the detection rate in saliva was 57.1% (8/14) in the second part of the study. the use of saliva alone may not be inferior to the use of NPA. the advantages of DFA include a relatively low cost, rapid results and simultaneous detection of multiple viral pathogens. however, the sensitivity of DFA is low compared with molecular assays. saliva should be evaluated as the specimen type in a diagnostic testing for novel respiratory viruses. this approach will lead to improvement in the management of patients and the prevention of community or nosocomial spread of infections."}
