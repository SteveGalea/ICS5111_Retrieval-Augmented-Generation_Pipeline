{"summary": "methods three provinces in the western part of Java Island in Indonesia participated in the study. the required sample size was 73 markets based on an estimated disease prevalence of 50% and a maximum error of 10% at 95% confidence. 60% of markets tested positive for AIV (H7N2) virus in areas in which the virus was endemic. questions about sanitation and slaughtering practices were also included. questionnaire was tested in 3 LBMs in west Java province to ensure coherence, appropriate use of terminology, and high face validity. PCR\u2013positive/markets tested (%), N = 1,862 VI\u2013positive/RT-PCR positive, n = 280 LBMs positive for zone Delivery 1 Inside cages on truck 6/45 (13.3) 1/6 11 2 Floor in delivery area 6/49 (12.2) 0/6 3 Water run-off in delivery area 4/38 (10.5) 0/4 Holding 4 Poultry cage floors 6/79 (7.6) 0/6 24 5 Holding area floor 8/80 (10) 1/8 data collection teams were instructed to increase the representativeness of the samples by swabbing different locations for each environmental site. if the market had 6 poultry stalls, each with its own scale for weighing poultry, teams collected 1 swab from each scale and pooled them into 2 pools of 3 swabs each. atants from a 1,000-L sample homogenized by vortex and centrifuged at 2,500\u20133,000 rpm into 9- to 10-day-old specific pathogen\u2013free eggs. the degree of association between AIV (H5N1) positivity in the 5 LBM poultry zones was determined by using Spearman rank correlation. most (82 [99%]) LBMs operated daily, with the same vendors operating in the same stalls. most (42 [51%]) LBMs had medium-sized poultry areas (11\u201350 poultry cages), and 21 (25%) had large poultry areas (>50 cages) most (71 [86%]) LBMs generally kept live poultry in the market for a few days until sold. the waste-disposal bin in the waste-disposal zone (19%) was a dedicated floor space where remnants are dumped daily and collected weekly by the local government rubbish collection team. all isolated viruses came from 6 LBMs, from which 1\u20134 viruses were isolated per LBM. correlations were high between holding and slaughter zones, slaughter and sale zones, and waste-disposal zones.
