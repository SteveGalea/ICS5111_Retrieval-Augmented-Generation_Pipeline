{"summary": "the introduction Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is one of the most important poultry pathogens worldwide. over eighty countries in north and south America, Europe, Asia, and africa reporting outbreaks each year. mortality rates may reach as high as 100% in unvaccinated flocks. the Kuroiler, a dual-purpose chicken, has multi-colored feathers to help with camouflage in the wild. it thrives in backyard or scavenging environments and thrives in backyard or scavenging environments. chicken embryo is immunocompetent and capable of producing an innate and adaptive response to pathogen prior to hatch. vaccination with inactivated oil emulsion NDV and Avian Influenza Virus (AIV) vaccine on the 18th day of embryonic development resulted in high seroconversion rates and antibody titers post hatch. Embryonated chicken egg infection with NDV and chicken Embryo Tissue Harvest Embryonated eggs were inoculated at days 10, 14 or 18 of embryonic development. 0.1 mL of the viral suspension was directly deposited into the allantoic fluid. embryo selected in the group infected at 18 days and harvested 72 hpi. embryo was placed at 4\u00b0C for 3\u20134 h to avoid opening eggs with viable embryos. embryo was extracted and rinsed three times in 1X PBS before selected tissues were harvested. each tube placed in the beat beater contained 100 mg of tissue. 600 L of lysate was added to a clean microcentrifuge tube. the supernatant was transferred to the gDNA eliminator column. the recommended protocol was followed from this point forward. all recommended kits and procedures were followed (QIAGEN Inc., Germantown, MD, United States) qPCR was prepared using RT2 qPCR Master Mix and cDNA according to manufacturer protocols and added to each well of the 96 well plate. gene network analysis was performed using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (QIAGEN, 2014) data was uploaded to IPA and Core analysis was performed to generate the network in Figure 2A. from this the genes with the most gene\u2013gene interactions and highest fold changes were selected and the network in Figure 2C was generated. network analysis of the six selected immune genes in the Leghorn and Fayoumi sublines using IPA software. red colored circles represent relative increases in expression of that gene in the infected chicken embryo lung tissues versus control. green circles represent downregulation, red lines represent inhibition and orange represents activation. titration of the virus was performed with the final titer of undiluted viral suspension of 107 50% egg infectious dose (EID50)/mL. the viral suspension was stored at -80\u00b0C until further use. eggs were sealed with an adhesive glue and placed back in incubators until death or removal for tissue harvest. the tissues were immediately stored at -80\u00b0C prior to further use. cDNA Synthesis cDNA synthesis was performed immediately after RNA extraction using the RNeasy Plus Kit (QIAGEN Inc., germantown, MD, United States) cDNA was stored at -20\u00b0C. the array contains 84 immune-related genes from the innate (Pattern Recognition Receptors, Cytokines, Other), adaptive (Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg markers), humoral, and inflammatory responses. the QuantiNova kit was recommended as most stable for shipment to Tanzania. the primers used for analysis can be found in Supplementary Table S2. data analysis Gene expression was analyzed using the Ct method. networks associated with diseases and functions of differentially expressed genes from the profiler array were mapped together. the six highly upregulated and interconnected genes (Mx1, CCL5, TLR3, STAT1, IL-8, and IRF1) from the array were selected for future analysis. three of the genes with the highest increase in expression were selected for a more comprehensive analysis of the immune response in the embryo. expression of all three immune genes was increased in the infected lung tissues at 18 days of embryonic development 72 hpi with considerably lower variation in expression than other infection time points. infection of the chicken embryo at 18 days was deemed the most suitable time point for examining chicken embryo immune gene expression. the same three genes, CCL5, Mx1, and TLR3, were examined in the lung tissue of the Kuroiler and local ecotype embryos infected at 18 days of embryonic development. the top canonical pathways included pattern recognition receptors in recognition of bacteria and virus, iNOS Signaling, communication between innate and adaptive immune cells, and toll-like receptor signaling. the top regulator effector network was the antiviral response. the identified associated network diseases and functions including infectious disease, the cell-mediated immune response, and organismal injury, were selected based on relevance to the immune response. the immune response profiles of 18-day NDV-infected embryos of the well-defined, highly congenic Fayoumi (M5.1 and M15.2) and Leghorn (Ghs6 and Ghs13) sublines were characterized (six infected embryos and six control embryos per subline \u2013 Ghs6, Ghs13, M5.1; eight infected and six control embryos per subline \u2013 M15.2. the red line signifies the cutoff between upregulation and downregulation of the genes. the average fold expression differences between challenged and control lung tissue in the inbred Leghorn and inbred Fayoumi sublines using IPA (QIAGEN Inc., Germantown, MD, United States5). the chicken embryo is immune-competent and the respiratory system almost fully developed a few days prior to hatch. examining the response of the chicken embryo to respiratory viruses such as NDV may be possible without the introduction of confounding variables post-hatch. multiple other studies have each discovered at least one of the genes studied here with elevated expression levels in the chicken. most surprising were the pathways, top diseases, and disorders associated with the genes including NDV infection, paramyxovirus replication, and lung infection. in most cases, TLR3, STAT1, and IRF1 are involved in signaling pathways that lead to stimulation of the end targets, CCL5, Mx1 and IL-8. the six genes examined here have been shown to be important in the chicken immune response to viral pathogens. the innate immune response is a complex and interconnected network that is dependent on many factors. the Ghs6 subline, previously found to be susceptible to NDV, differs from the other sublines pathway analysis by activating RNA virus replication rather than inhibiting it. it is particularly intriguing since the high responders, Ghs6 and M5.1, differ in the network analysis from the low responder, Ghs13. a more comprehensive study of the innate immune response of the different chicken lines. model provides a framework for future studies of the development of the innate immune response of chickens to NDV (and other pathogens) allowing for screening of large numbers of birds to uncover genetic markers for both disease resistance/susceptibility and productivity traits."}
