{"summary": "a computational method identifies the conserved viral sequences at the genus level for all viral genomes available in GenBank. the identity of the virus in a test sample is determined by the signals of both genus and species-specific probes. a detection and classification procedure to determine the identity of a virus directly from detection signals results in the rapid identification of the virus. oligonucleotide microarrays have been used for monitoring and analyzing viral pathogens. the entire set of probes on the microarray is designed to detect the mutations in the viral genome to allow one specific viral species and its subtypes to be discerned. a software program for implementing such a virus identification strategy has been developed [8]. the program determines the identity of specific viruses in a test sample by comparing observed patterns of microarray hybridization intensities with a set of theoretical hybridization energy profiles. the method narrows down the computation of conserved sequences to the genus level and eliminates sequence redundancy. long 70-mer probes help to alleviate sequence-dependent hybridization variation. additional species- or subtype-specific probes were designed for each fully sequenced virus to enhance the specificity of virus identification. identity of a virus is determined based on a simple arithmetic algorithm. conserved genus probes were designed using the algorithm described by Chang and Peck. genera with insufficient viral sequences are marked in the virus probe database. extra species-specific probes are designed for each viral genus. conserved sequences of vi are defined as the regions with the maximum number of similarity hits in Si(x): Ci = x| Si(x) = max x (Si(x)). the longest sequence segment CL (the query sequence) in C'(G) is selected first and aligned against the other sequences in it using the BLASTN program. probes exhibiting sequence overlap are further screened using the Mfold program [11] to pick the one that has the maximum Gibbs free energy of the secondary structure. each pj P is aligned against vi G using the BLASTN program. if more than one set of P s * having Card( P s * ) = min Card(PS) and (iii) randomly pick one of those P s * with the same max if more than one set of P s * satisfy condition (ii) we then keep searching for other subsets of P- P s * with the same criteria until the probe set finally has a twofold coverage of G. the genus contains the following 11 fully sequenced viral genomes: NC_002645, human coronavirus 229E; NC_001451, avian infectious bronchitis virus; NC_003436, avian infectious bronchitis virus; AF201929, murine hepatitis virus strain ML-10; AF208066, murine hepatitis virus strain Penn 97-1; NC_001846, murine hepatitis probe set (p1, p4) is the best selection since the two probes together maximize the similarity hits (max = 10) with G. all of them produce the same eight similarity hits with all the virus members of G. the coronavirus genus was aligned with the other 10 genomes. remaining 10 coronavirus viral genomes were used as the calibration set for computing the conserved sequences. the conserved sequence detection method used a high stringency criterion for hybrid formation in the conserved sequence detection method. the longest sequence in each group represented the nonredundant conserved sequence set of the coronavirus genus without SARS-CoV. the sequence alignment with the SARS-CoV genome shows that the group 1 conserved sequence is located between nucleotides 15732 and 15829 of the SARS-CoV genome. 14 viral genera and 333 nonredundant viral genome sequences were included in the large-scale cross-validation. the in silico cross-validation results produced an average successful detection rate of 92%. a test virus chip with 72 70-mer oligonucleotides included genus probes covering 3 viral genera (7 conserved probes for coronavirus, 12 probes for flavivirus, and 7 probes for enterovirus) hybridized to the 7 test viral samples (X-axis) the specific identity of the test virus can be read directly from the extent of the specific signal strength in the chart. we intentionally left out EV71 sequence information in the conserved probe design process and made no EV71 species-specific probes on the test chip. however, the hybridization of EV71 to the chip resulted in a high signal intensity for the enterovirus genus probes. the probes eligible for identity determination were prescreened using the hybridization intensity criteria described in the Methods section. the probes eligible for identity determination were prescreened using the hybridization intensity criteria described in the Methods section. the conserved genus probes for each viral genus were designed using the algorithm described by Chang and Peck [9]. the conserved genus probes for each viral genus were designed according to the following guidelines: a viral genus G = vi| i = 1,..., n is a collection of n viruses, in which each virus vi (i = 1,..., n) is associated with a subset of G. the longest sequence segment CL (the query sequence) in C'(G) is selected first and aligned against the other sequences in it using the BLASTN program. any sequences in C'(G)-CL having 80% similarity with CL are grouped together with CL to form C'1(G), the first subgroup of C'(G), then excluded from C'(G) each pj P is aligned against vi G using the BLASTN program. we then keep searching for other subsets of P- P s * with the same criteria until the probe set finally ends. conserved sequence design method shows similarity sequence segments for a given virus vi compared to the other five (n-1) viral genomes (G(i)) the highest-ranking (max(Si)) similarity sequences should be the most-conserved sequences (Ci) for virus vi and the other five viral genomes. tis virus strain ML-10; AF208066; AF208066; AF220295; AF220295; bovine coronavirus strain Quebec; NC_002306, transmissible gastroenteritis virus; and SARS-CoV, SARS coronavirus. a panel of conserved segments derived from all of the viral genomes in G is obtained. at least two probes are required for the full detection of all viruses in G. probe set (p2, p5, p8), (p2, p7, p9), and (p2, p8, p9) produce the same eight similarity hits with all the virus members within a viral genus. the coronavirus genus was aligned with the other 10 genomes G(SARS-CoV) of the coronavirus genus. the five longest sequences represent the nonredundant conserved sequence set of the coronavirus genus without SARS-CoV. the longest conserved sequence in group 1 had 80% sequence similarity with the SARS-CoV genome at nucleotide positions from 15732 to 15829. the design method was validated by testing if the computed conserved sequences could successfully detect the novel SARS-CoV. 14 viral genera and 333 nonredundant viral genome sequences were included in the large-scale cross-validation. in total, 14 viral genera and 333 nonredundant viral genome sequences were included in the large-scale cross-validation to verify the probe design algorithm. a test virus chip was constructed with 72 70-mer oligonucleotides. the chip included genus probes covering 3 viral genera. specific probes covering 26 species of viruses in the coronavirus and flavivirus (19 species) genera. we intentionally left out EV71 sequence information in the conserved probe design process. however, the hybridization of EV71 to the chip resulted in a high signal intensity for the enterovirus genus probes. the hybridization result of the mixed viral sample EV71+SARS-CoV showed that the virus belonged to this genus. the genus signal strength is defined in the Methods section. there are 46 species-specific probes for 26 viruses in the flavivirus and coronavirus genera, and that there are no enterovirus-specific probes. lentivirus is one example for which a poor detection rate (55.6%) is shown in Figure 3C. the principle behind the conserved probe design is to search for high similarity sequences that could hybridize to all the virus members of a given genus but not to the viruses of other genera. cross-hybridization issues may be unavoidable in hybridization reactions involving a large number of probes. cross-hybridization signals are always lower for the nontarget sequences than for the target sequences (which are a perfect match) if the emerging new virus belongs to a here. viral genus is assigned using a scoring method based on signal strength. if more than one genus are present, there will be more than one non-zero Sum(Fe|G) values. if more than one genus are present, there will be more than one non-zero Sum(Fe|G) values. GenBank provides the most comprehensive collection of viral sequences available to the public. the algorithm can be applied to any publicly available viral sequence database. the proposed approach of employing genus- and species-specific probe sets makes it possible to minimize the number of probes. the new probe design method and virus detection method allows direct reading of virus identity. the methods and protocols can be applied to the analysis of large-scale virus microarray data to determine the identities of detected viruses by direct readout of a computer program. the viral genus identity in a test sample is assigned to the genus with the highest genus signal strength (i.e., 100%) the presence of multiple viruses in a sample will result in a nonzero genus signal strength. we then score and rank the possible virus identities in the specific probe region on the basis of the specific signal strength.
