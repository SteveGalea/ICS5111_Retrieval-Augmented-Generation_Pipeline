{"summary": "the SARS-CoV is a positive-stranded RNA virus with an 30 kb genome. of these, orf3a encodes a protein of 274 amino acids. ER regulates cellular metabolism and protein synthesis in response to perturbations in protein synthesis and folding. hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes increased transcription from the glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and GRP94 promoters through the activation of PERK and ATF6 pathways. cytopathic strain of bovine viral diarrhea virus induces apoptosis through UPR by activating the PERK pathway. the PERK arm of UPR affects innate immunity of a cell by accelerating degradation of the IFNAR1 subunit. degradation signal is phosphorylation of a serine residue within the IFNAR1 degron. this leads to increased ubiquitination and receptor degradation of IFNAR1. mbrane glycoproteins such as the spike (S) and matrix (M) proteins are produced [32], of which the S protein induces ER stress [4]. to rule out induction of ER stress merely due to over-expression of a viral protein, we also studied the effects of the HIV proteins Nef and Vpu and the hepatitis E virus (HEV) Orf3 protein, on grp78 and grp94 activation. the grp94 promoter by the SARS-CoV 3a protein was also tested in Huh7 and COS cells. this promoter was also activated about 3 to 4 folds by expression of the 3a protein. results using two different ER sensor reporters suggest that the 3a protein causes ER stress. the IRE-1 and ATF6 pathways lead to reprogramming of the cell and induction of ER associated degradation. the endoribonuclease activity causes unconventional splicing of the mRNA for the X box-binding protein 1 (XBP-1). to determine the effect of 3a expression on the IRE-1 pathway, we carried out reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) Huh7 cells were transfected with 1 g of either pSGI or pSGI-3a-HA. untransfected cells were treated with 1.5 mM dithiothreitol for 45 min prior to harvest. RT-PCR for histone mRNA was used as a loading control. 3a-expressing cells showed increased levels of phospho-eIF2 (peIF2) without a concomitant increase in total eIF2 levels. we then cotransfected cells with expression plasmids for wild type eIF2 or its dominant-negative (DN) or dominant active (DA) mutants, pGRP78-Luc and either pSGI or pSG-3a-HA. the activity of the CHOP promoter was assayed in cells cotransfected with pSGI-3a-HA expression construct. the other viral proteins showed variable results. the 3a protein activates the PERK pathway. one set of cells were treated with 20 M SB203580 for 12 hr before harvest. the controls were treated with the same volume of DMSO. each bar is representative of two separate experiments, each with three independent transfections. increased IFNAR1 phosphorylation was observed in 3a expressing cells. as a positive control, tunicamycin also showed increased IFNAR1 phosphorylation. this would indicate either decreased synthesis or increased degradation of the IFNAR1 protein. normalized cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with an anti-IFNAR1 antibody followed by western blotting (WB) with an anti-Ubiquitin antibody. cells were also directly subjected to western blotting with indicated antibodies as controls. a significant decrease in the equilibrium levels of IFNAR1 in 3a-ECFP expressing cells compared to control cells. the 3a protein reduces endogenous levels of IFNAR1. the cells were harvested 48 hr post-transfection. the SARS-CoV 3a Protein Induces ER stress The ER uses the ER for processing its structural and nonstructural proteins [32]. the spike (S) and matrix (M) proteins are produced [32], of which the S protein induces ER stress. to rule out induction of ER stress merely due to over-expression of a viral protein, we also studied the effects of the HIV proteins Nef and Vpu and the hepatitis E virus (HEV) we also tested the effects of the SARS-CoV 3a protein on grp78 promoter in two other cell lines. this promoter was also activated about 3 to 4 folds by expression of the 3a protein. this promoter was also activated about 3 to 4 folds by expression of the 3a protein. the 3a Protein Differentially Activates the PERK but not the IRE-1 and ATF6 Branches of UPR. the IRE-1 and ATF6 pathways lead to reprogramming of the cell and induction of ER associated degradation. the spliced XBP-1 mRNA was not observed in vector control or 3a-expressing cells. treatment with thapsigargin led to increased levels of the p50 form. cells were transfected with 1 g of either pSGI or pSGI-3a-HA. untransfected cells were treated with 500 nM thapsigargin (Tg) for 16 hr prior to harvest. transfections were carried out in 12-well plates. 3a protein-mediated ER stress is activated, phosphorylating its downstream target, the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit (eIF2) the construct TK.mATF4.UTR.Luc.pGL3 contains the 5\u2032-untranslated region of ATF4 fused to the coding region of firefly luciferase. there was about 17-fold increase in ATF4 expression in 3a-expressing cells compared to control cells. the other viral proteins did not show any significant effect on ATF4 translation. the grp78-luc reporter plasmids (0.25 g each) were co-transfected in Huh7 with either plasmid pSGI-HA (vector control) or pSGI-3a-HA (0.75 g each) one set of cells were treated with 20 M SB203580 for 12 hr before harvest, while the controls were treated with the same volume of DMSO. 3a expressing cells showed increased ubiquitination of the IFNAR1 protein. this is important for its ubiquitination and downregulation at the cell surface. increased IFNAR1 phosphorylation was observed in 3a expressing cells. normalized cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with an anti-IFNAR1 antibody followed by western blotting with an anti-Ubiquitin antibody. cell lysates were also directly subjected to western blotting with indicated antibodies as controls. the cells were then imaged with a confocal microscope. the images quantitated and colocalization coefficients calculated as described. increased ubiquitination and translocation of IFNAR1 in 3a expressing cells is likely to result in reduced IFNAR1 levels in these cells. the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of IFNAR1 signal was estimated. the flow cytometry plot is representative of three separate experiments. the MFI values shown are an average (SD) of these experiments. IRE-1 dimerizes and undergoes autophosphorylation and activation of its endoribonuclease activity. this causes unconventional splicing of the IRE-1 effector X box-binding protein 1 (XBP-1) mRNA that encodes XBP-1, a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor. results show neither XBP-1 mRNA splicing nor ATF6 proteolysis in 3a cells. the induction of endoplasmic reticulum Associated Degredation requires activation of the IRE1/XBP1 and ATF6 pathways. this includes ER degradation-enhancing -mannosidase-like protein (EDEM), which is directly involved in recognition and targeting of unfolded proteins for degradation during UPR. the 3a protein activates p38 MAPK and is proapoptotic. 3a-expressing cells respond to ER stress by activation of the PERK pathway. prolonged PERK activation would lead to apoptosis. other viral proteins were also tested for upstream (grp78 promoter activation) ligand-independent downregulation of type I IFN signaling was observed in virus-infected cells. this involved PERK activation during UPR causing the phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination and degradation of IFNAR1. the hepatitis C virus expresses viral proteins that cause ER stress. reagents were from Sigma Chemical Co.
