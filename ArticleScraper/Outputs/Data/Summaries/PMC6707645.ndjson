{"summary": "the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is a small enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus, member of the Arterivirus genus. it has a very narrow cell tropism, and may induce persistent asymptomatic infections [5, 6]. tulathromycin is a triamilide in which its 15 lactone-ring is comprised of 3 polar amine groups. pleuropneumoniae exerts cytotoxic effects in macrophages and neutrophils. tulathromycin inhibits CXCL-8 and LTB, which ultimately leads to severe pulmonary tissue damage and death. tulathromycin promotes the apoptotic death of neutrophils and macrophages. tulathromycin is able to restore the phagocytic function and attenuate the pro-inflammatory phenotype of PRRSV-infected monocyte-derived macrophages. piglets were fed twice with antibiotic-free feed 16% Hog Grower. pigs were euthanized by intracardiac injection with sodium pentobarbital. blood was pooled and centrifuged for 20 minutes at 1200 x g, 4\u00b0C. PBMCs were collected, washed with sterile-filtered 2X Hank\u2019s Balanced Salt Solution. cells were then plated in tissue-culture treated 6, 12, 24 and 96 well plates. cells were then plated in tissue-culture treated 6, 12, 24 and 96 well plates. subsequent adherent monocytes were incubated for 7 days at 37\u00b0C. 5% CO2 in IMDM supplemented with 10% heat inactivated(HI)-pig serum (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA), 100 IU/mL penicillin-streptomycin and 15% L929 supernatant. culture media was changed every 3 days. tulathromycin has immunomodulating effects in bovine and porcine neutrophils and macrophages. this phenomen is critical to the mode of action of the drug. the drug concentrations used in these experiments are consistent with this knowledge. culture media was replaced by pre-warmed IMDM supplemented with 10% pig serum for all experimental groups. PRRSV infection was performed for another 2 to 48 hours depending on the experiment. at least 150 macrophages per group in 3 independent experiments were assessed. supernatants were processed to measure interleukin-8 (CXCL-8) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) concentrations. samples were processed as per manufacturer\u2019s instructions. intensity, proportional to ROS levels within the cytosol was measured using a SpectraMax M2e microplate reader (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA) reading at 480 nm (excitation) and 530 nm (emission) non-opsonized phagocytosis was monitored using fluorescently labelled Saccharomyces cerevisiae zymosan A particles. macrophages containing one or more zymosan particles or latex beads were considered as \u2018positive cells\u2019. a minimum of 150 cells per experimental group were counted from randomly selected fields. labellings were covered with tape prior to microscopic observations. IMDM containing 10% HI-pig serum or staurosporine (1M) were used as negative and positive controls respectively. Annexin V staining was performed on the same experimental groups to further assess apoptotic cell death. extracellular and intracellular viral particles counts were monitored with plaque titration assays. for intracellular counts, supernatants were harvested at 2, 12, 24 and 48 hours p.i. for intracellular counts, macrophages were washed twice with warm (37\u00b0C) phosphate buffer saline. s and prevent differentiation into monocyte-derived dendritic cells. cells were washed 3 times in ice-cold PBS to remove all L929 media. fixed cells were then washed 3 times in cold PBS and stained for 1 hour. d previously [36, 37, 36] cells were cultivated in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium. they were supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 IU/mL penicillin-streptomycin. cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 and passaged twice weekly. piglets were fed twice with the antibiotic-free feed 16% Hog Grower (Hi-Pro Feeds, Okotoks, AB, Canada), water was provided ad libitum. after 22 weeks, animals were euthanized and tissues made available for secondary teaching and research use. cells were counted using a hemocytometer and viability was assessed by 0.1% trypan blue exclusion. PBMCs purity was determined by Diff-Quick staining on cytospin slides. non-adherent mononuclear cells were washed with warm HBSS. at day 7, more than 95% of the cell preparations were differentiated macrophages. at day 7, more than 95% of the cell preparations were differentiated macrophages. tulathromycin (Draxxin; Zoetis, Parsippany-Troy Hills, NJ, USA) diluted in IMDM + 10% HI-pig serum at a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL or 1 mg/mL. drug levels measured in PELF cells reached concentrations 565 times greater than those in plasma [40] it is believed that this great affinity for cellular uptake may be related, in part, to the tri-basic chemical structure of the drug and the trapping of ionized drug within acidic phagolysosomes. the effects of tulathromycin and PRRSV on macrophage differentiation and activation were determined via microscopic observations and cytokine quantification. supernantants were collected and frozen at -80\u00b0C until processed. at least 150 macrophages per group were assessed. cells induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were infected for 2, 4, 12, or 24h (m.o.i of 0.5) or uninfected (uninfected control) same treatments were performed on macrophage stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (1g/mL LPS from E. coli O26:B6. extracellular zymosan A particles were washed away with warm PBS. cells were fixed in ice-cold 80% acetone solution. actin stained with the Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin antibody. the pro-apoptotic effects of tulathromycin and PRRSV were assessed using a cell death detection ELISA kit (Roche) similar experimental treatments were conducted with cells stimulated with IMDM containing 10% HI-pig serum or staurosporine (1M) supernatants were harvested at 2, 12, 24 and 48 hours p.i and incubated with confluent MARC-145 cells for 96 h. supernatants were harvested and incubated with confluent MARC-145 cells for 96 h. fluorescence ratio was calculated using ImageJ. five fields of view per well were counted per sample. statistical analysis All data sets were tested for normality. non-parametric data were compared with a Kruskal-Wallis test. results Blood monocyte derived macrophages are reproducibly infected by PRRSV. cells cultured for (A) 1 (B) 4 and (C) 7 days following seeding onto plastic 24 and 48 well plate or cover slides were stained using Diff Quick. on day 7, cells are chararcterized by large macrophage-like morphology, forming typical cytoplasmic vacuolar structures and extensive pseudopods. viral titers in monocytes incubated with L929 were significantly higher at 48 hours p.i. compared to viral titers in monocytes cultivated without L929 supernatant. numbers of PRRSV infectious particles were significantly elevated in MDMs cultivated with L929-supernatants at all time points of the infection. compared to MDMs cultivated in medium supplemented with HI-pig serum alone. in uninfected cells, less than 20% of cells exhibited this change in morphology. nearly 60% of the cells exhibited this phenotype upon PRRSV infection. tulathromycin pre-treatment significantly inhibited this morphological change in MDMs. PRRSV-induced CXCL-8 secretion was significantly inhibited when MDMs were pre-treated with tulathromycin. the positive control LPS also significantly increased the production of CXCL-8. 7 days old MDMs were exposed to HBSS (control) or tulathromycin (0.5 mg/mL; TUL) for 1 hour. cells were exposed to LPS (1g/mL) for 1 hour before incubation with PRRSV. tulathromycin and PRRSV exhibit an additive effect on the induction of apoptosis in MDMs. cells were stained with annexin V, a phospholipid-binding protein with high affinity for the early apotptic marker phosphatidylserine. Tulathromycin and PRRSV induce time dependent apoptosis in porcine MDMs. Staurosporine (STS) served as positive pro-apoptotic control. values are expressed as mean SEM n = 4\u20135 per group. tulathromycin prevents PRRSV-induced early necrosis PRRSV infection (m.o.i = 0.5) significantly increased the levels of LDH produced during necrosis 12 and 24 hours p.i. PRRSV infection significantly inhibited both phagocytic functions of the cells. tulathromycin treatment alone did not alter MDMs phagocytosis versus controls. following treatment and infection, MDMs were incubated with fluorescently labeled zymosan particles for 1h. n = 150\u2013300 macrophages/group. Images and histograms are representative of 5 independent experiments. n = 150\u2013200 macrophages/group. Images and histograms are representative of 4 independent experiments. PRRSV replication is not necessary to inhibit phagocytosis in porcine MDMs. MARC-145 cells were stained with a FITC-conjugated anti-PRRSV nucleocapsid SR30F antibody. size and numbers of viral foci were calculated in presence or absence of tulathromycin. tulathromycin does not change PRRSV receptor expression in MDMs. two major PRRSV receptors have been extensively studied. experiments measured viral receptor expression in MDMs. treatment with tulathromycin (TUL; 1mg/mL) did not affect the expression of PRRSV receptors CD163 or CD169 in porcine MDMs. treatment with TUL did not affect the expression of any of the receptors in cells cultured with or without L929 supernant. one-day-old monocytes were significantly less susceptible to PRRSV compared to 7 days old differentiated MDMs. PRRSV viral particle numbers increased by a 1.69 log (50-fold increase) in MDMs and by a 1.1 log (13-fold increase) in blood monocytes, between 2 and 48 hours p.i. monocytes cultivated in L929-conditioned medium showed same morphology as those cultivated in medium devoid of L929-factors. titers in monocytes incubated with L929 were significantly higher at 48 hours p.i. compared to viral titers in monocytes cultivated without L929 supernatant. tulathromycin treated our cells at a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL. at these concentrations, neither the virus nor the drugs significantly induced MDM apoptosis at the experimental time points. if the cells were treated at a concentration of 1mg/mL, functional analysis was performed before 12 hours of incubation. at least 150 macrophages were counted for each experimental group. data represent mean SEM, n = 5 per group. tulathromycin inhibits PRRSV-induced CXCL-8 secretion. intracellular ROS levels were significantly lower in MDMs incubated with LPS and PRRSV compared to MDMs stimulated only with LPS. 7 days old MDMs were exposed to HBSS (control) or tulathromycin (0.5 mg/mL; TUL) for 1 hour before incubation with TUL and PRRSV. PRRSV-induced IL-10 inhibition was abolished when cells were pre-treated with tulathromycin at 2 and 12 hours post-infection. cells were stained with annexin V, a phospholipid-binding protein with high annexin V. at 24 hours, both tulathromycin alone or PRRSV alone induced significant levels of apoptosis compared to controls (4\u2014fold increase vs. control) levels of apotosis were almost double those measured in cells exposed to single treatments. Staurosporine (STS) served as a positive pro-apoptotic control. values are expressed as (A) absorbance and (B) fluorescence ratios vs control. triton X served as positive pro-necrotic control. values are expressed as ratios vs control. data represent mean SEM, n = 5 per group. the same results were obtained when the cells were infected for 2 hours. non-opsonized phagocytosis of PRRSV-infected porcine MDMs was restored. HBSS (control) or tulathromycin (1mg/mL; TUL) treatment for 1h and infection with PRRSV (m.o.i. = 0.5; Virus and TUL+Virus) for 12 hours was measured. cells were washed 3 times with warm PBS to remove free beads. tulathromycin does not alter PRRSV viral titers, inside or outside macrophages. tulathromycin pre-treatment did not alter viral titers compared to exposure to PRRSV alone. MARC-145 nuclei were stained with a FITC-conjugated anti-PRRSV nucleocapsid SR30F antibody. fluorescence ratios, reflecting PRRSV infection, were not different between untreated cells and cells treated with tulathromycin. experiments measured viral receptor expression in MDMs. MDMs incubation in L929-supernatant supplemented medium was sufficient to significantly increase the number of CD163 positive cells. more than 90% of MDMs were CD163 positive versus less than 30% in pig serum supplemented medium alone. however, following L929-incubation we were not able to detect any CD169 positive cells. tulathromycin inhibits PRRSV-induced inflammatory responses in porcine macrophages and protects against the phagocytic impairment caused by the virus. the two most common cellular models are PAMs and MARC-145 cells [12, 52]. L929 supernatant is a source of M-CSF and is used to induce macrophage differentiation. the addition of L929 strongly upregulated CD163 but abolished CD169 expression. this is consistent with recent observations showing that CD163 but not CD169 enabled non-permissive cells to become susceptible. recent findings indicate that these pseudopods promote intercellular junctions allowing PRRSV to evade host immunity through direct intercellular spread. if TUL may prevent intercellular junctions and thus hinder PRRSV immune evasion, more research is needed. a decrease in ROS production compared to cells exposed only to LPS. this suggests that PRRSV may inhibit intracellular ROS production of MDMs during bacterial infections. this suggests that PRRSV induce IL-10 production to increase its infectivity. studies have shown that PRRSV is directly able to impair macrophage phagocytosis. phagocytosis is triggered when phagocytic receptors including opsonic receptors (FcR) or pattern recognition receptors such as the mannose receptor, are activated. these observations pave the way towards studies in vivo to assess whether this antibiotic might help control secondary infections during PRRSV infections through this mechanisms. some macrolides such as tilmicosin and tylvalosin have been recently demonstrated to possess direct anti-viral effects against PRRSV. 658.4KB, docx."}
