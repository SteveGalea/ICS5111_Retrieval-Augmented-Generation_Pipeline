{"summary": "the contribution of community health workers (CHWs) to healthcare delivery has been recognised globally. there is a lack of global consensus on CHWs\u2019 scope of practice. there is inadequate health policy support for CHWs in low and middle income countries. studies suggest that CHWs are rising to the task of ensuring that the impact is less felt by communities and health systems. the potential contributions of CHWs to tackling the current global health security threat posed by the Zika virus, yellow fever, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and influenza cannot be overemphasised. no year limit was included in the search. we also undertook a review of reports on the activities of community health workers in Ghana. in Ghana, two complementary types of CHWs are notable. the first category is an informal, poorly trained health service-supporting CHW. the second strand exists where CHWs are representatives of the community and act in the interest of the community. village health workers (VHWs) provided the first semblance of CHWs in Ghana. their actions and activities were mostly based on altruism. lack of coordination and inadequate supervision of their activities were among the reasons why the VHWs programme was discontinued. the Navrongo Experiment was conceptualised under the assumption that by recruiting, training and deploying community health officers to rural communities, inequities in access to healthcare services could be bridged. the Navrongo Experiment resulted in increased access to healthcare services, immunisation coverage, reduced child and maternal mortality while improving the rural population's overall health. the role of the guinea worm in Ghana has been so critical that both the national Guinea Worm Eradication Programme and some development partners have acknowledged it as the most important factor in Ghana's guinea worm eradication campaign. the project was implemented by world Vision Ghana in partnership with Ghana Health Services. it trained CBSVs and TBAs to perform a number of tasks, including recording births and deaths, and reporting disease outbreaks. the main aim of the project was to improve TBAs' skills and resource them adequately to conduct normal deliveries. in northern Ghana, the literature suggests that CHWs were recognised as a conduit to providing voluntary counselling and testing services. however, only a few studies have covered the activities of CHWs in HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment in communities. the lack of clearly defined recruitment criteria and strategy has often generated tensions among community members. an important dimension regarding the recruitment of CHWs in Ghana is the active role of NGOs and non-state actors. the scope of practice of CHWs in Ghana has broadened beyond prevention and health promotional activities to encompass some curative care such as malaria and diarrhoea. the lack of clarity on the operational mandate of CHWs in Ghana has often undermined the effectiveness and efficiency of their roles in healthcare delivery at the community level. this contradicts the WHO position and existing literature. the lack of a policy directive on CHWs lends credence to our position. the current policy position of the government does not remunerate CHWs for contributing to deliver community health service. the situation creates an inherent ambiguity and varying expectations of their roles which affects the optimum engagement of CHWs. there are neither mechanisms nor a framework to regulate their practice or certify CHWs as having the requisite competencies to practice. lack of effective supervision of CHWs is one of the notable problems CHWs face in Ghana. this category of CHWs will be an informal extension of the formal healthcare system with explicitly defined roles, training and remuneration to augment the delivery of healthcare. despite the active involvement of CHWs in the health system, they are invisible nationally and subnationally. development of a long-term strategy that will see gradual replacement or absorption of CHWs into the mainstream or formal health service in Ghana. proposed one million CHW Campaign project should incorporate an integration plan aimed at enlisting existing deserving CHWs who have a wealth of experience and skill to their credit. delivery in Ghana suggests the need for state and non-state actors to build better working partnerships with CHWs. this is because CHWs play an indispensable role in delivering health to their communities and assume and actively play the role of health activists and advocates. the reported challenges faced by CHWs can be addressed through appropriate national policy articulation. a \u2018hybrid\u2019 form of CHWs (a mix of the two categories) can be found in Ghana. a \u2018hybrid\u2019 form of CHWs (a mix of the two categories) can be found in the country. community health nurses (CHNs) were introduced to deliver healthcare in mostly deprived parts of Ghana. however, the relatively long period needed to train them and funding challenges limited adequate training and deployment of CHNs. the activities of VHWs were reinvigorated in the early 1990s. the second strand of CHWs exists where CHWs are representatives of the community and act in the interest of the community. a \u2018hybrid\u2019 form of CHWs (a mix of the two categories) can be found in Ghana. the Navrongo Experiment is one of the areas where CHWs' contributions to healthcare delivery have been acknowledged globally. the Navrongo Experiment is one of the areas where CHWs' contributions to healthcare delivery have been immense. the Navrongo Experiment was conceptualised under the assumption that by recruiting, training and deploying community health officers to rural communities, inequities in access to healthcare services could be bridged. the Navrongo Experiment resulted in increased access to healthcare services, immunisation coverage, reduced child and maternal mortality. within a period of 3 years of its implementation, the results pointed to a 50% reduction in childhood mortality rate. health centres for treatment, distribution of water filters in communities have been acclaimed as having played a tremendous role in decreasing childhood illnesses and mortalities. the role of TBAs has been reported to double the number of women referred to clinics and hospitals for potentially life-saving care and support. the main aim of the project was to improve TBAs' skills and resource them adequately to conduct normal deliveries, particularly in hard-to-reach rural communities. in mid-2007, an initial evaluation was done. the role of CHWs has been important in the fight against the spread of HIV/AIDS. a cross-sectional survey conducted in northern Ghana reported an overwhelming acceptance of the use of lay health counsellors to provide community-based voluntary counselling and testing services. the lack of clearly defined recruitment criteria and strategy has often generated tensions among community members. some earlier studies have indicated how recruiting CHWs from local communities often served to generate tension and/or perpetuate gender inequalities. a reasonable involvement of CHWs in limited activities has the tendency to enhance outcomes in community-based health interventions compared with an unlimited scope of practice. a reasonable involvement of CHWs in limited activities has the tendency to enhance outcomes in community-based health interventions compared with an unlimited scope of practice. recruitment Prior to the inception of the one million CHW campaign, there was no national framework to guide the recruitment of CHWs in Ghana. recruitment was dependent on the community, the health programme, and the donor agency or development partner (NGO) involved. the lack of clearly defined recruitment criteria and strategy has often generated tensions among community members. in south africa, one CHW can provide healthcare services to about 10 to 1000 households. in other settings, the roles of CHWs have been observed to vary from community mobilization for immunisation campaigns, health talks, first aid, creating awareness on disease control. the WHO has cited the positive correlation between incentivising CHWs and lower rates of attrition. a spirit of volunteerism and altruism is rather emphasised in the work of lehmann and Sanders. the absence of a policy directive on CHWs lends credence to our position. the current policy position of the government does not remunerate CHWs for contributing to deliver community health service. this only exacerbates the dwindling enthusiasm of CHWs and the time they commit to their duties. s are taking up more curative care activities in addition to preventive-based care interventions. their activities should be supervised and coordinated closely to potentially optimise their productivity and improve health outcomes. a further step by the Ministry of Health (MOH) to scale up the number of frontline staff to provide healthcare to the rural populations in Ghana. lack of a national framework to guide activities of CHWs. recruitment, credentialling, scope of practice, remuneration, career development, performance management, supervisory mechanisms. establishment of professional and/or regulatory body that will exercise oversight over CHWs by defining, monitoring or enforcing the standards and practice of CHWs in Ghana. partnerships between TBAs and SBAs would be critical for helping healthcare workers to learn from TBAs how best to address the cultural needs and concerns of childbearing women. however, even if the health system were to train and deploy sufficient numbers of SBAs to all parts of the country in future, TBAs could still play important roles in helping healthcare workers to provide culturally competent care."}
