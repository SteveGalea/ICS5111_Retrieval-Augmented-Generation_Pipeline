{"summary": "81 eligible patients categorized into bacterial infection, viral infection, coinfection, and non-infectious groups. influenza virus was the most frequently isolated virus, followed by enterovirus/rhinovirus, coronavirus, bocavirus, metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, 3, and 4, and respiratory syncytial virus. exacerbations are important targets for treatments and prevention of disease progression of COPD. there is a lack of identified predictors of long LOS. CAT is suitable for routine clinical use for both stable and exacerbating COPD. patients with an established history of COPD recruited with a post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) to forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio 70% at diagnosis. standardized pulmonary function test was performed with a dry spirometer device. patients should be able to understand and complete the CAT independently. LOS was defined as the duration from admission to discharge from our hospital. 81 patients with COPD exacerbation were diagnosed with LOS. LOS was defined as the duration from admission to discharge. a pharyngeal swab was rotated five to six times and allowed to remain for 5 seconds. the swab was immediately immersed in 3 mL viral preservation liquid. swabs were analyzed consecutively for the presence of respiratory viruses. ral Panel FAST v2 kit is based on multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR), flexible multi-analyte profiling (xMAP) and xTAG techniques. sputum was obtained in a sterile container prior to the initiation of AECOPD treatment. the analyses consisted of bacterium culture, identification, and antibiotic susceptibility testing. patients with an established history of COPD recruited with a post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) to forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio 70% at diagnosis. patients should be able to understand and complete the CAT independently. LOS was defined as the duration from admission to discharge from our hospital. co-morbidities included hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cerebral infarction, coronary artery disease. LOS was defined as the duration from admission to discharge. 5% of predicted normal value 54.026.8 52.127.0 56.527.4 42.317.6 57.428.1 FEV1/FVC, % 55.48.9 56.07.6 56.910.3 51.210.1 55.19.6 Notes: Data are presented as number (%) or mean SD. types 1, 2, 3, and 4, coronaviruses, enteroviruses, rhinoviruses, bocaviruses, enteroviruses, adenoviruses, and bocaviruses were incubated at 37\u00b0C in an incubator in the atmosphere of 10% CO2. sputum was obtained in a sterile container prior to the initiation of a treatment and examined within 30 minutes. total nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) were extracted and purified using mini kit (QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin Kit, Cat. No 57704, Hilden, Germany) and stored at 70\u00b0C until use. all pharyngeal swabs were analyzed consecutively for the presence of respiratory viruses upon arrival at the Department of Clinical Laboratory in the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University. plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C in an incubator in the atmosphere of 10% CO2. all pathogenic organisms were subjected to antibiotic sensitivity. 81 patients were eligible, 29 excluded, and two patients died from acute respiratory failure. 12 patients were found with multiple viral infections. LOS of non-infectious group was shorter than the other groups. LOS of non-infectious group was shorter than the other groups. the longitudinal axis of the picture above represents the days of stay in hospital. the central box represents the value from the lower to the upper quartile (25%\u201375%) the middle line inside the box represents the median value. the lines extend from the minimum to the maximum values, excluding outliers that are displayed as separate points. we found no statistically significant difference in FEV1 among different infectious phenotypes (P>0.05) there was no statistically significant difference in classification of patients according to the new GOLD staging system among the four groups. coronavirus (n=9), bocavirus (n=9), metapneumovirus (n=5), parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, 3, and 4 (n=3), and RSV (n=3). relationship between respiratory infectious phenotypes and LOS was 9.64.1 days as whole. the central box represents the value from the lower to the upper quartile (25%\u201375%) the lines extend from the minimum to the maximum values. an outlier is defined as a value that is smaller than the lower quartile minus 1.5 times the interquartile range. there was no statistically significant difference in the classification of patients according to the new GOLD staging system among the four groups. no statistically significant difference in the classification of patients according to the new GOLD staging system among the four groups. potential bacterium was detected in 21% of acute exacerbation events. this showed the predominance of P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii, and Klebsiella. LOS has been widely used to measure the acute impact on patients with AECOPD. CAT is a patient-completed instrument to assess and quantify symptom and inflammation burden in patients with COPD. we hypothesize there may be a correlation between respiratory infectious phenotypes and CAT. CAT was positively correlated with LOS, which makes CAT a useful tool to assess the impact of AECOPD symptoms on health status. influenza viral infection could be attributed to mortality of COPD exacerbations. CAT may be a predictor of longer LOS with coinfection."}
