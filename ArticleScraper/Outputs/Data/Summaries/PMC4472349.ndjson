Tigers revealed a higher risk for the occurrence of tubular degeneration and necrosis compared to leopards. interstitial nephritis occurred in animals with a median age of 13 years. there was a significant substantial agreement with interstitial fibrosis. there was also an association between age and the presence of interstitial fibrosis. lesions included loss of nephrons (16/38 animals; 42%), lympho-plasmacytic pyelitis (15/26 animals; 57%; renal pelvis was only available in 26 animals) and cytoplasmic storage of a yellow pigment within tubular epithelial cells (11/38 animals; 29%) lesions listed were present in several wild felids simultaneously. Kidney, tiger, 19 years, male (animal no. 27) chronic interstitial nephritis. one animal (animal no. 36) showed an ulcerative glossitis located at the ventro-lateral aspect of the tongue. there were no indications of fibrous osteodystrophy. kidneys of one animal (animal no. 33) displayed focal, interstitial nephritis. a 19-year-old male tiger (animal no. 25) and a 9-year-old female leopard (animal no. 7) with interstitial nephritis revealed similar mineralization of kidneys, lung, meninges and blood vessels of hippocampus associated with parathyroid hyperplasia. they were classified as tubular, interstitial, glomerular pathology and miscellaneous. interstitial kidney lesions consisted of lympho-plasmacytic interstitial nephritis (27/38 animals; 72%; Fig 1A and 1B), fibrosis (26/38 animals; 68%, Fig 1C), eosinophilic interstitial nephritis (4/38; 11%) and metastatic-purulent nephritis (4/38; 11%). eosinophilic interstitial nephritis decreased with age. GN was classified as membranoproliferative (7/38 animals; 18%), mesangioproliferative (5/38 animals; 13%) and membranous (4/38 animals; 11%; Fig 1B and 1D) degenerative and inflammatory kidney lesions in 38 non-domestic felids. lesions listed were present in several animals simultaneously. hritis and a moderate, diffuse thickening of Bowman\u2019s capsule are present. tubular basement membranes displaying severe diffuse depositions of basophilic, plaque-like extracellular material (mineralization) kidneys displayed bilaterally a coarse granular surface and a narrow (0.5\u20130.8 cm) renal cortex. a 19-year-old male tiger (animal no. 25) and a 9-year-old female leopard (animal no. 7) with interstitial nephritis revealed similar mineralization of kidneys, lung, meninges and blood vessels of hippocampus associated with parathyroid hyperplasia or adenoma. ulcerative gastritis, azotemia and interstitial nephritis coexisted with interstitial nephritis. three animals revealed enteritis in the small intestine with age ranging from 0.7 to 19 years. risk for enteritis significantly decreased with age. salmonella typhimurium and Clostridium perfringens type A were identified in intestinal samples from an 8-month-old male tiger with catarrhal enteritis. eosinophilic inflammation within the intestinal mucosa was present in a 19-year-old male tiger with moderate nutritional condition. thirteen animals (34%) revealed enteritis in the small intestine with an age ranging from 0.7 to 19 years. the risk for the occurrence of enteritis significantly decreased with age. the risk for the occurrence of enteritis significantly decreased with age. the exocrine pancreas was assessed in 33 felids and nodular hyperplasia was present in 5 animals (5/33 animals; 15%) there was no significant association between the occurrence of hyperplasia and neoplasia. plasms found in liver and pancreas included a single hepatic (animal no. 14; 1/38 animals; 3%) and pancreatic carcinoma (animal no. 21; 1/38 animals; 3%) in each animal. hyperplasia and neoplasm Eleven of 16 hyperplastic lesions detected in 12 of 38 animals were located in endocrine organs. parathyroid hyperplasia (animal no. 25) or adenoma (animal no. 7; Fig 3B) were found in 2 animals. metastatic mineralization was present in kidneys, lung, meninges and blood vessels of the hippocampus. both adrenal and parathyroid hyperplasia were more common in older animals. tumors including adenomas (n = 5) and a carcinoma (n = 1) represented the second most common neoplasms detected in captive wild felids. risk was significantly increasing with age (OR = 3.65, p 0.0001) parathyroid gland adenoma displayed a capsule and compresses adjacent normal follicles of the thyroid gland (asterisk). inflammatory lesions were found in 4 of 24 felids most commonly characterized by purulent endometritis and/or pyometra (n = 3). uterus, inflammatory lesions found in 4 of 24 felids most commonly characterized by purulent endometritis and/or pyometra (n = 3) neoplasms Organs of the reproductive tract were second most commonly affected by neoplasms (8/34 tumors; 24%) leiomyomas represented the most commonly detected tumor type in the present study (7/34 tumors; 21%; age ranged from 12 to 22 years with median age of 18 years large felid leukoencephalomyelopathy characterized by bilateral dilatation of the lateral ventricles (asterisks) and malacic foci within the white matter. spheroids were found in the brain stem of this animal. a psammomatous meningioma was located at the cerebral meninges of the cranium. this neoplasm was associated with mild multifocal lympho-histiocytic meningitis. however, there was no compression of the adjacent brain parenchyma. male felids were significantly predisposed for the presence of meningeal fibrosis compared to females. a psammomatous meningioma was located at the cerebral meninges of the craig. male felids were significantly predisposed for the presence of meningeal fibrosis. neoplasm was associated with mild multifocal lympho-histiocytic meningitis. there was no compression of the adjacent brain parenchyma. the presence of pneumonia was not associated with the occurrence of anthracosis, interstitial and pleural fibrosis, pulmonary mineralization and hemosiderosis. there was no sex or species predisposition for the presence of any respiratory changes. the fibrinous pneumonia of 1 lion (animal no. 16) showed intralesional fungal hyphae measuring approximately 6 m in width with thin parallel walls, regular septa and dichotomous acute angular branching suggestive of Aspergillus sp. no additional tests were carried out. Pleural mesotheliomas were observed in 3 animals including 1 cheetah (animal no. 1) and 2 tigers (animal nos. 21 and 25), all of which were male felids. epithelial component of a mesothelioma displaying a papillary growth pattern. logistic regression analysis revealed that FIV infected felids have a higher risk for endometritis. risk for enteritis, pneumonia, metastatic purulent nephritis or neoplasia was not influenced by FIV infection. inflammatory lesions were detected including catarrhal enteritis (n = 2; see inflammation of alimentary tract), pyometra (n = 2, see inflammation of genital tract), granulomatous pneumonia (n = 1, see inflammation of respiratory tract) and metastatic purulent nephritis (n = 1, see inflammation of urinary system). neoplastic lesions included a hemangiosarcoma and a hepatic carcinoma (animal no. a male cheetah (animal no. 1) revealed a myelolipoma within the spleen. cardiovascular system Miscellaneous Cardiac lipomatosis was detected in 12 of 38 animals. the presence of miscellaneous heart findings was not associated with age, sex or specific animal species. lesions were characterized by superficial fibrillation, eburnation, chondrocyte loss, chondrone formation, myelofibrosis, osteosclerosis and proliferation of synovial villi. the risk for the presence of degenerative joint disease was not influenced by age, gender or animal species. present study aimed to investigate macroscopic and histologic findings in 38 captive wild felids (18 tigers Panthera tigris, 8 leopards Panthera pardus, 7 lions Panthera leo, 3 cheetahs Acinonyx jubatus and 2 cougars Puma concolor) the most frequently observed lesions consisted of inflammation and degeneration of the kidney (87%), various neoplasms (50%), enteritis (34 elevated exposure to carcinogens or infectious agents should be considered as other risk factors [9]. this was particularly related to the high frequency of thyroid gland tumors in 5 (animals no. 6, 22, 25, 26, 29, 29) and 1 (animal no. 4) animals respectively with a median age of 19 years in affected animals. parathyroid hyperplasia or adenoma was present in 5 animals (animal nos. 4, 5, 7, 25, 27) concurrent metastatic mineralization of kidneys, lung, bone marrow and/or brain was noticed in 2 of those animals. pheochromocytoma was diagnosed in a 19-year-old male tiger (animal no. 27) the cause of the low rate of mammary gland tumors in the present study remained undetermined. all female felids (24/38 animals) were treated with contraceptive drugs regularly. a frequency of 6% is reported in captive wild felids and cheetahs. multiple myeloma affecting the bone marrow, lymph nodes, spleen and the pituitary gland was diagnosed in a 19-year-old tiger. this type of neoplasm was previously only reported in a jaguar. papillomas were graded as malignant tumors with metastasis in one case. psammomatous meningioma was found in an 18-year-old female cougar. meningiomas are common neoplastic lesions in companion cats. there is only one report about a meningioma in a 17-year-old Bengal tiger. the risk for enteritis, pneumonia, metastatic purulent nephritis or neoplasia was not significantly influenced by FIV infection. it has to be considered that this result does not rule out a possible impact of retroviral infection on the development of such lesions because of the limited number of animals. a feline morbillivirus was identified and associated with tubulointerstitial nephritis in a case control study in domestic cats. however, in the present study no morbillivirus antigen was detected in renal lesions. impaired renal function may result in uremic gastroenteritis. animal no. 33 showed inflammatory and degenerative renal lesions. these cases were interpreted as metastatic mineralization not initiated by renal or parathyroid gland pathology. hypercalcemia due to vitamin D intoxication or idiopathic conditions was suspected in these tigers. in wild felids, several viruses are associated with pneumonia. avian influenza A (H5N1) virus (tigers and lions), canine distemper virus (Serengeti lions), canine distemper virus (Serengeti lions), FIPV (mountain lion) and FIV (African lion; [25,74,78,79]. lophthisis was only present in a 3-year-old Bengal tiger (animal no. 37) however, neither parvovirus- nor FeLV-antigen was detected immunohistologically within the intestinal tract of these animals. chronic enteritis is reported to occur in 19% of FIV-infected domestic cats. infection was associated with increased number of lymphoid follicles and lympho-plasmacytic gastritis. it is suggested that this may be related to higher baseline cortisol levels in captive animals causing an alteration in their immune response. ytic meningitis was detected in 3 animals. underlying cause of meningitis remains undetermined. none of the animals with meningitis were tested positive for FIV. male felids revealed a significant higher frequency of meningeal fibrosis compared to female individuals. fibrosis in kidney, heart and lung was not influenced by gender. further studies are needed to confirm this finding and to investigate possible pathogenetic factors involved in increased meningeal collagen synthesis. istiocytic endometritis with cystic glandular hyperplasia was found in an 8-year-old tiger, which was most likely related to infectious or abiotic factors. in domestic cats, amyloid deposition in pancreatic islets of Langerhans is common and can be detected in 65% of animals with diabetes mellitus. however, islet amyloidosis is also described in approximately 50% of cats that lacked evidence for endoc thyroid tumors are common in wild felids, according to previous observations from the zoological gardens from Knoxville and Philadelphia. in the wild felid population of the Knoxville zoological garden, thyroid tumors are reported in animals with a median age of 18 years [6]. hyperplasia or adenoma was present in 5 animals (animal nos. 4, 5, 7, 25, 27) metastatic mineralization of kidneys, lung, bone marrow and/or brain was noticed in 2 of those animals (animal nos. 7 and 25) pheochromocytoma was diagnosed in a 19-year-old male tiger (animal no. 27) all female felids (24/38 animals) treated with contraceptive drugs regularly. lymphoreticular and hematopoietic tumors were third most commonly occurring type of neoplasms. myelolipomas in liver (n = 7) or spleen (n = 1) of cheetahs and tigers were described previously. itary gland was diagnosed in a 19-year-old tiger (animal no. 26) this type of neoplasm was previously only reported in a jaguar [52] papillomas were detected in two tigers (animal nos. 21 and 25) and one cheetah (animal no. 1). a psammomatous meningioma was found in an 18-year-old female cougar. meningiomas are common neoplastic lesions in companion cats. there is only one report about a meningioma in a 17-year-old Bengal tiger. the low frequency of both FIV infection and endometritis was not significantly influenced by FIV infection. in contrast, the risk for enteritis, pneumonia, metastatic purulent nephritis or neoplasia was not significantly influenced by FIV infection. in the present study, renal pathology was the most frequent finding with 87% of all investigated captive wild felids. a feline morbillivirus was identified and associated with tubulointerstitial nephritis in a case control study in domestic cats. however, in the present study no morbillivirus antigen was detected in renal lesions. impaired renal function may result in uremic gastroenteritis. animal no. 33 showed inflammatory and degenerative renal lesions. however, these cases were interpreted as metastatic mineralization not initiated by renal or parathyroid gland pathology. hypercalcemia due to vitamin D intoxication or idiopathic conditions was suspected in these tigers. in wild felids, several viruses are associated with pneumonia including avian influenza A (H5N1) virus (tigers and lions), canine distemper virus (Serengeti lions), FIPV (mountain lion) and FIV (African lion; [25,74,78,79]. feline herpesvirus 1 and feline calicivirus should be considered as potential viral causes of lower respiratory tract disease. neither parvovirus- nor FeLV-antigen was detected immunohistologically within the intestinal tract of these animals. chronic enteritis is reported to occur in 19% of infected domestic cats. a so far unidentified infectious agent must be considered etiologically in the remaining animals. Helicobacter acinonyx is only reported in captive but not in wild felids. it is suggested that this may be related to higher baseline cortisol levels in captive animals causing an alteration in their immune response. viruses like Felid herpesvirus 1, FIPV, FIV as well as bacteria like Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Cryptococcus neoformans have to be considered. none of the animals with meningitis were tested positive for FIV. dilated myelin sheaths, myelinophagia and spheroids with mild to moderate degree of severity were detected in 6 animals. fibrosis in kidney, heart and lung was not influenced by gender. the cause of this sex predisposition is unclear. further studies are needed to confirm this finding. in domestic cats, amyloid deposition in pancreatic islets of Langerhans is common. there was no evidence for amyloidosis in any of the investigated animals. nephropathy characterized by tubular alterations, interstitial nephritis and glomerular lesions was a common finding. supporting information S1 Table.
