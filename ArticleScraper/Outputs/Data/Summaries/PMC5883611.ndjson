{"summary": "tailed DNA bacteriophages carry one of three types of tails. long contractile (members of the family Myoviridae), long noncontractile (Siphoviridae) and short noncontractile (Podoviridae) the apparently subtler changes in long and short noncontractile tails during this process are less clear (1, 6). DNA packaging results in rearrangement of hexons (hexamers of gp5) in capsid (18, 19), loss of scaffolding protein (20), and sequential binding of tail proteins gp4 and gp10 (21, 22) genome is sealed inside the head by the addition of a trimer of gp26 needle proteins that plugs the channel employed by the DNA to enter the procapsid. genome must traverse outer cell membrane, peptidoglycan layer, periplasmic space, and inner membrane to reach the cytoplasm. low-resolution tomographic reconstructions of phage T7 virions reveal the assembly of an apparent tube that extends away from the virion along the portal axis through the periplasm (10) the ejection proteins of the two phages exhibit no sequence homology. empty particles lack gp26 and DNA and are sometimes called \u201cempty heads\u201d. low-resolution tomographic structures of bacteriophages have been determined. there are no published high-resolution cryo-EM structures of bacteriophages. the visible opalescent empty particle band was harvested by needle puncture. the empty particle fraction was concentrated 10-fold with an Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter, dialyzed against TM buffer, further purified by an identical sucrose gradient velocity sedimentation. an initial global alignment was performed in Frealign (mode 3) until no improvement in resolution was obtained. refinement (mode 1) proceeded until no improvement in resolution was obtained. initial model was also prepared using ab initio methods in auto3DEM. the local resolutions of the icosahedral and asymmetric reconstructions were analyzed using the e2FSC.py feature in EMAN2 (53) the local resolutions of the icosahedral and asymmetric reconstructions were deposited to the Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB) the visible opalescent empty particle band was harvested by needle puncture. the empty particle fraction was concentrated 10-fold with an Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter, dialyzed against TM buffer, further purified by a second identical sucrose gradient velocity sedimentation. asymmetric model was constructed by computationally enhancing the tail from just one fivefold vertex of the icosahedral reconstruction. asymmetric reconstruction reached a resolution similar to that obtained with Frealign. the tail was positioned at each of the 12 fivefold vertices. asymmetric reconstructions have been deposited to the Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB) under entries EMDB: 7315, EMDB: 7316, and EMDB: 7317 (C12 along Z axis) results Visualization of gp26 P22 particles by cryo-EM phages were prepared by infecting S. enterica with P22 phages carrying a null nonsense mutation in gene 26. micrographs were acquired with nanoprobe mode at a nominal magnification of 92,000 (pixel size of 0.158 nm) and spot index six with a 4K 4K FEI Falcon two-direct detector camera and a total dose of 57.6 e/A2. virion coat protein was docked as a rigid body into density for each of the seven uniquely positioned subunits using Chimera (58) at this resolution, subunits do not display detectable differences in monomer shape or intramolecular organization compared to the mature virion. however, density was significantly displaced in the volume corresponding to the spine helix for fivefold proximal G subunits. the icosahedral map was low-pass-filtered to 50, the resolution at which it displays replicates of the tail density at each of the 12 vertices. initial asymmetric model was made by isolating the tail density from a single fivefold vertex and appending it to one vertex of the icosahedral-symmetrized model. empty P22 particle reconstruction is missing DNA (green) and the gp26 plug (yellow) the new density (black arrow) is found in the empty P22 particle extending from gp10 (cyan) this suggests the density extending from gp10 is distinct. an atomic model of portal protein from the mature virion was docked into the three-dimensional density of the empty particle reconstruction using the fit map feature in Chimera. the empty particle portal was found to be indistinguishable from the virion portal at this resolution, except that the C-terminal barrel portion of the dodecameric portal is splayed at the top. cryo-EM micrograph of gp26 empty P22 particles was used to image empty particles at defocus settings ranging between 1 and 3 m underfocus. resulting images revealed particles in various orientations and contained views of both capsid and tail proteins. a reconstruction with icosahedral symmetry was determined and refined to 7.8 resolution (0.143 FSC threshold criterion (57)) the reconstruction reveals a capsid structure in which the gp5 coat proteins adopt the same T = 7 laevo arrangement as found in mature P22 virions. xYZ (colored rainbow) was rigid-body docked into the density for each of the seven gp5 subunits (A\u2013G) in each asymmetric unit. changes were observed in the spine helix of subunit (G) as evidenced by the model residing outside of the density envelope. the reconstructed gp26 P22 empty particle was determined at an overall resolution of 12.5. the asymmetric capsid was determined at a significantly lower overall resolution (11) compared to the icosahedrally symmetrized capsid (7.8 ). the empty P22 particle reconstruction is missing the gp26 needle that seals the DNA. the hollow tube is resolved to 20, but the six copies of gp10 located just above this region are resolved at 10 resolution. the portal protein density was reconstructed from the empty particles in a way similar to molecular replacement crystallography (52); the model used to initiate the asymmetric reconstruction process contained a 50, low-pass-filtered model of just the tail and capsid. the bacteriophage P22 portal protein is known to have different conformations depending on the maturation state of the virus (55), but it remained plausible that the conformation of the portal protein might have an additional change in empty particles. our results demonstrate that the portal structure remains essentially unchanged inside the capsid after DNA release and does not revert to the conformation it adopts in procapsids. digital removal of the \u201csurfboard\u201d density does not affect the density extruding from the phage tail, suggesting that the extra density is a real structural component of the tail. previous studies have shown that particles lacking the gp26 plug contain ejection proteins associated with them. analyzed data.
