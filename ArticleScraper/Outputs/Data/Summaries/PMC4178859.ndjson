{"summary": "severe human infections with recently emerging pathogens demonstrate the need for public health strategies that rapidly contain potentially dangerous emerging infectious diseases. emergency vaccines should include early induction of protective immunity and the capacity to elicit diverse antigen-specific immune responses. however, our understanding of the immunological principles of successful emergency vaccination is limited. the orthopoxvirus (OPV) ectromelia virus (ECTV) is a natural mouse pathogen inducing mousepox, a lethal disease in mice. after initial respiratory infection, the virus spreads via lymph and blood circulation to internal organs, resulting in a severe systemic disease. the genetic similarity of ECTV to variola virus (VARV) has led to the development of ECTV models as surrogates for human smallpox a 1,000-fold-lower dose of MVA vaccine is sufficient to protect C57BL/6 mice and immunodeficient mice lacking the interferon alpha/beta receptor. protective low-dose vaccination required induction of CD8+ T cell responses. mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection with 1 mg ketamine and 0.04 mg xylazine per 10 g body weight. mice were depleted of CD8+ T cells by i.p. administration of mouse monoclonal antibodies. ELISPOT plates were preincubated overnight with the antibody solution and then incubated with the cell suspension that had been stimulated with the virus-specific peptide B8R20\u201327 (TSYKFESV) the spots were counted and analyzed by using an automated ELISPOT plate reader and software following the manufacturer's instructions. sacrificed mice were fixed in formaldehyde (4%) for 24 h. sections of 4 m were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. primary antibody for immunohistochemistry was a rabbit anti-VACV diluted 1:2,000. interleukin 12 (IL-12) was measured using the IL-12p70 ELISA kit. all assays were performed according to manufacturer's instructions. female C57BL/6N mice (6 to 10 weeks old) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Sulzfeld, Germany) mice have been 20-fold backcrossed with C57BL/6N mice and have a deficient type I IFN system. 106 cells were stained in 50 l PBS supplemented with 3% fetal calf serum. T cells were detected using phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled CD3, PE-Cy7-labeled CD4 and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled CD8 antibodies. ELISPOT plates were preincubated overnight with the antibody solution. they were then incubated with the cell suspension stimulated with the virus-specific peptide B8R20\u201327 (TSYKFESV) sections of lungs, livers, and spleens of sacrificed mice were fixed in formaldehyde (4%) for 24 h. organs (lungs, livers, and spleens) were removed under aseptic conditions from sacrificed or dead mice. organs were frozen and thawed, weighed, and homogenized using 0.1 g of organ material. ELISPOT measured OPV-specific CD8+ T cells at day 8 postimmunization. groups of C57BL/6 mice (n = 5) were immunized intramuscularly with 108, 106, or 105 PFU MVA or mock vaccinated (PBS) low-dose MVA immunization effectively protects against lethal mousepox. mice were intranasally infected with 200 ECTV and monitored for signs of disease and survival. all animals receiving 108 PFU MVA were fully protected against the challenge infection. vaccinated mice showed only minimal weight loss (5%) or delayed increase in body weights on days 10 to 16 following ECTV infection. vaccinated mice depleted of CD8+ T cells succumbed to mousepox after challenge with ECTV. vaccinated wild-type mice were effectively protected from disease and death. low-dose immunization with 105 PFU MVA also essentially depends on CD8+ T cells for protective immunity against a lethal ECTV infection. high viral loads in the lungs, livers, and spleens of mock-vaccinated mice. these virus titers ranged from 104 to 106 PFU ECTV per gram of tissue. this is typical for the systemic spread of ECTV infection in C57BL/6 mice. micrographs show representative areas of lung (D), liver (E) and spleen (F) from a mock-vaccinated C57BL/6 mouse. low-dose MVA immunization protects IFNAR/ mice from mousepox. BL/6 mice were inoculated intramuscularly with 105 PFU MVA or PBS. total numbers of B8R+ CD8+ T cells in blood from IFNAR/ mice were determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. IFNAR/ mice with 105 PFU MVA also fully protected against lethal ECTV infection. mock-vaccinated IFNAR/ mice developed systemic mousepox and succumbed to the infection within 8 days after challenge. sections of tissues were immunostained (IHC) with polyclonal rabbit antibody raised against VACV Lister virions to detect ECTV antigen. micrographs show representative areas of lung, liver, and spleen from a mock-vaccinated IFNAR/ mouse (A, B, and C), lung, liver, and spleen from an MVA-vaccinated mouse (D, E, and F) n.d., not detectable, shows that CD8+ T cells are also essential to allow MVA-mediated protection of IFNAR/ mice. n.d., not detectable. vaccinated and ECTV-challenged C57BL/6 or IFNAR/ mice produced significantly more B8R20\u201327 epitope-specific CD8+ T cells than mice inoculated with only MVA. ECTV infection in a time window very close to the immunization strongly amplifies the MVA-induced virus-specific T cell responses. ELISPOT measured OPV-specific CD8+ T cells at day 8 postimmunization. groups of C57BL/6 mice were immunized intramuscularly with 108, 106, or 105 PFU MVA or mock vaccinated (PBS) at 8 days postimmunization, splenocytes were prepared. low-dose MVA immunization effectively protects against lethal mousepox. mice were intranasally infected with 200 ECTV and monitored for signs of disease and survival. all animals receiving 108 PFU MVA were fully protected against the challenge infection. vaccinated mice demonstrated only minimal weight loss (5%) or delayed increase in body weights on days 10 to 16 following ECTV infection. vaccinated mice depleted of CD8+ T cells succumbed to mousepox. ted mice resulted in accelerated disease progression, with symptoms and mortalities occurring about 2 days earlier than in mock-vaccinated wild-type controls. low-dose immunization with 105 PFU MVA also essentially depends on CD8+ T cells for protective immunity against a lethal ECTV infection. high viral loads in the lungs, livers, and spleens of mock-vaccinated mice. these virus titers ranged from 104 to 106 PFU ECTV per gram of tissue. this is typical for the systemic spread of ECTV infection in C57BL/6 mice. micrographs show representative areas of lung (D), liver (E) and spleen (F) from a mock-vaccinated C57BL/6 mouse. low-dose MVA immunization protects IFNAR/ mice from mousepox. 57BL/6 mice were inoculated intramuscularly with 105 PFU MVA or PBS. total numbers of B8R+ CD8+ T cells in blood from IFNAR/ mice were determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. immuneizations of IFNAR/ mice with 105 PFU MVA also fully protected against lethal ECTV infection. mock-vaccinated IFNAR/ mice all developed systemic mousepox. sections of tissues were immunostained (IHC) with polyclonal rabbit antibody raised against VACV Lister virions to detect ECTV antigen. micrographs show representative areas of lung, liver, and spleen from a mock-vaccinated IFNAR/ mouse (A, B, and C), lung, liver, and spleen from an MVA-vaccinated mouse (D, E, and F) ens of WT or CD8+ cell-depleted IFNAR/ mice were removed and homogenized. at the time of death or at the end of the experiments, organs were removed and homogenized. the amount of virus was determined by plaque assay (3 to 5 animals per group) vaccinated and ECTV-challenged mice produced significantly more B8R20\u201327 epitope-specific CD8+ T cells than mice inoculated with only MVA. this was confirmed by analyzing B8R20\u201327 epitope-binding CD8+ T cells following multimer staining and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. single-shot vaccinations with 100- to 1,000-fold less MVA induce levels of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells comparable to those elicited by the standard dose of 108 PFU. this is not completely unexpected, since previous studies demonstrated that low-dose MVA immunizations of HLA-A*0201 transgenic mice can elicit substantial numbers of epitope-specific T cells. low-dose inoculations of MVA vaccine could provide rapid protection of C57BL/6 mice against a lethal intranasal challenge with ECTV. 105 PFU MVA was sufficient to protect against the onset of clinical disease and death, indicating vaccine efficacy following challenge. the absence of detectable ECTV in the organs of all vaccinated animals suggests that low-dose vaccination can completely eliminate the challenge virus. the induction of type I IFN in various MVA-infected cells is well described (27, 31, 34, 35), and type I IFNs are essential for C57BL/6 mice to resist primary ECTV f.p. infection. curiously, we also found protection of IFNAR/ mice lacking the type I interferon receptor following immunization with only 105 PFU MVA vaccine. we hypothesize that IL-12 may regulate the induction of CD8+ T cell effector function in the IFNAR/ mice. however, we found that MVA-vaccinated IFNAR/ mice produced IL-12, while immunized C57BL/6 mice produced IFN- but not detectable IL-12. this agrees with previous studies showing that high levels of IFN-I actively inhibit production of IL-12. study demonstrates the critical requirement for production of the antiviral cytokine IFN-. the mousepox infection also seemed to substantially influence the antiviral CD8+ T cell response elicited by MVA immunization just 2 days before challenge. MVA is a proven vector for efficiently delivering heterologous antigens. it could be a useful tool for generating emergency vaccinations targeting new pathogens."}
