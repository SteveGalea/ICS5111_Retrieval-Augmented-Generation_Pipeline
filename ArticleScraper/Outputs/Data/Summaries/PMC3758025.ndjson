{"summary": "we present Health Web Science (HWS) as a subdiscipline of Web Science. it examines the impact of the Web\u2019s health-related uses on the design, structure, and evolution of the Web itself. overlapping but divergent disciplinary orientation of HWS motivates specific research efforts around better utilization of, innovation on, and communication. Web Science studies the Web\u2019s topology and how they can be utilized to understand the nature of the Web itself. from a social science perspective, these same connections represent the overt and concealed interpersonal connections among the Web\u2019s users. the Web Science research initiative recognized the importance of the Web and the concept of Web Science. WS will help engineer the Web and Web-related technologies to facilitate health-related endeavors. activities relevant to HWS include the synthesis, curation, and discovery of Web pages containing health information. the focus of HWS is more broadly aligned with those outside of the medical community and is allied with nonmedical stakeholders disciplines. researchers would also explore the network effects, the subsequent use/users of the Web, and how policy might need to change given all of these influences. the distributed, adaptable, and highly flexible nature of the Web facilitates the shift from the current model of a centralized, hospital-focused and provider-centric infrastructure. the Web can play a useful role in tailoring health care to individual needs based not only on medical conditions but also on personal, family, and social factors. the new types of data that continue to emerge from both the health and life science domains have enormous potential to improve health and save lives. the new types of data that continue to emerge from both the health and life science domains have enormous potential to improve health and save lives. an interested researcher may approach this problem by leveraging a social network analysis model [21] to determine individual network node(s) that are more effective at influencing the whole, or social cascades. understanding how these social and online phenomena translate into effects on the health of individual network participants could improve effectiveness through targeted dissemination of health-related messages and crafting of health policy. patient engagement is contrary to the scientific epistemology of evidence-based medicine (EBM), which has been regarded as glacial in its rate of obtaining results [25]. citizen science is the conscientious, judicious, and explicit use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients [26]. health web scientists apply their specific domain-expertise to issues of data and knowledge annotation on the Web. a person collects his/her personal data from sensors or smartphones and uses this information as a feedback loop for self-improvement. this practice aligns with preventative medicine and with the world health organization's desire to empower patients to look after and take responsibility for their own health. health web science has a role in the wellness agenda in a variety of ways. the concept of the \u201cexpert patient\u201d seems closely related to the patient engagement / citizen science topic described above. the Web interface developed by [38] uses a combination of semantic text-mining algorithms that extract the concepts from any Web page a patient is reading together with a local database of their personal information. the tool then combines these concepts and data with globally distributed expert knowledge and \u201cmashes up\u201d all of this information to provide personalized hints and guidelines within that Web page. the focus on big data marks a key differentiation between the discipline of Health Web Science and disciplines under the Health 2.0/Medicine 2.0 umbrella. the quantity and complexity of big data necessitates the development of new tools capable of automatically converting this data into new biomedical knowledge that is accessible to the clinical practitioners, researchers, and the public, over the Web. the discovery and application of new medical knowledge will become instantaneous, a point described by some as the \"health care singularity\" if new information is generated through social networks, clinical research, or \"bench-science\", its subsequent translation will affect treatment at the bedside and has the potential to become instantaneous. the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002-2003 was characterized by 3 phenomena: how fast the disease spread, how quickly it was stopped, and how a virulent virus killed relatively few people. more than one third of the rumors identified by the tool led the WHO to identify and isolate cases of SARS. HWS is the pursuit of novel ways to provide relevant, accurate, personalized, expert medical information. the momentum behind this emergent discipline has been established. dialogue now needs to continue so that the diverse stakeholder communities can mutually educate each other for the greater benefit of society."}
