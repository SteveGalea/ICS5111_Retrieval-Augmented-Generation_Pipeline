{"summary": "HCV can be classified into seven major genotypes and over 67 subtypes (3). differences exist among the various genotypes that could impact therapy (5\u20138). more research is needed to better understand HCV replication. recombinant alpha IFN (IFN-) is a part of the standard of care to treat HCV (2). NS3/4A proteinase can cleave mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS; also known as IPS-1, VISA, and Cardif) adaptor protein TRIF (TIR-domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-) to abrogate RIG-I- and Toll-like receptor 3 (T c-di-GMP and c-di-AMP produced by bacteria are strong elicitors of host type I IFN production (26, 27) by binding to the adaptor protein STING (28) mammalian cells have been reported to express the enzyme cGAS (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase) to produce the 2\u2032,3\u2032-cyclic GMP-AMP that can activate type I IFN production (29\u201334) 293T cells (ATCC), and 293-MSR cells (Invitrogen) were maintained in modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 incubator. replicons 1b/Con1 (pFKI389/NS3-3\u2032/WT) and 1b/Con1-RLuc were cultured in DMEM-10% FBS containing pcDNA-STING with a Flag tag was previously described. chimeric NS4Bs, 2a/1b-A, 2a/1b-C, 2a/1b-B(1-2), 2a/1b-B(3-4), and 1b/2a-B were linearized with ScaI. chimeric replicons and cDNA clone were linearized with XbaI.

Western blot signals were detected with ECL prime detection reagent (GE Healthcare) mRNA level of STING was analyzed using quantitative RT-PCR. siRNA-transfected cells were then trypsinized and seeded in 96-well plates. cGAMP was added at indicated concentrations, and the Renilla luciferase activity was determined. transfections were performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) the ratio of firefly luciferase to Renilla luciferase activities was normalized to the level of the vector control. the cells were seeded in glass coverslips in 6-well plates overnight and then treated with cGAMP for 48 h. 293T cells were seeded onto 6-well plates and transfected with pcDNA-STING-Flag (1 g) and pcDNA-1bNS4B-HA (1 g) by Lipofectamine 2000. cells were washed and lysed in RIPA buffer with a cocktail of proteinase inhibitors. 2\u2032,3\u2032-Cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) was synthesized with recombinant human cGAS catalytic domain using ATP and GTP substrates. cGAMP was purified by ultrafiltration and Q-Sepharose ion-exchange chromatography and eluted with a gradient of NH4HCO3. pcDNA-1bNS4B and pcDNA-2aNS4B with a C-terminal hemagglutinin tag were constructed by PCR amplification and inserted into NheI/XhoI of pcDNA3.1. for transient expression, chimeric NS4Bs, 2a/1b-A, 2a/1b-B, 2a/1b-C, 2a/1b-B(1-2), 2a/1b-B( HCV replicon RNA was introduced into Huh7.5 cells by electroporation of trypsinized cells washed with ice-cold Cytomix (120 mM KCl, 0.15 mM CaCl2, 10 mM K2HPO4-KH2PO4, 25 mM HEPES, 2 mM EGTA, 5 mM MgCl2; pH 7.6) the integrity and concentration were confirmed by agarose gel electro total RNA was isolated using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNAs were quantified by real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) using the appropriate primers listed in Table 1. the lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 30 min. the primary monoclonal antibodies to detect NS5A, -actin and the goat anti-mouse IgG coupled with horseradish peroxidase were from Sigma and Roche. combination of cGAMP with DAAs on HCV 1b/Con1 replicon replication. increased concentrations of direct-acting HCV NS5B inhibitors sofosbuvir and NS5A inhibitor daclatasvir were added along with different doses of cGAMP. 293T cells were seeded at 4 104 cells/well for 24 h in 96-well plates. cGAMP was added at indicated concentrations. luciferase activity was determined at 48 h posttreatment. the 1b/Con1-RLuc-harboring Huh7.5 cells were seeded on glass coverslips in 6-well plates overnight and then treated with cGAMP for 48 h. the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed for 15 min in 4% paraformaldehyde (in PBS) at room temperature followed by 0.5% Triton X-100 treatment at 4\u00b0C for 15 min to permeabilize cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. immunoprecipitation used either a rat-anti-HA monoclonal antibody or a mouse anti-Flag monoclonal antibody. the 50% cytotoxicity concentration for cGAMP was in excess of 400 g/ml. cGAMP suppresses 1b/Con1-RLuc replication in Huh7.5 cells. cGAMP suppresses 1b/Con1-RLuc replication. monoclonal antibody and goat anti-mouse antibody stained with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. cGAMP and direct-acting antivirals additively inhibit 1b/Con1 replicon replication. cGAMP could enhance the inhibitory effects of DAAs on 1b/Con1 replicon replication. we used siRNA to knock down the endogenous STING in 1b/Con1 replicon cells. the knockdown by siRNA decreased the STING mRNA and protein levels by 75% and 50%, respectively. knockdown of STING dramatically diminished the inhibitory effect of cGAMP on 1b/Con1 replicon replication. the data were plotted as an average of triplicates with standard deviation (error bar) the asterisk denotes a P value of 0.05. effects of STING knockdown on the inhibitory effect of 1b/Con1 replicon replication by cGAMP. cGAMP triggers type I IFN and antiviral ISG expression. cGAMP interacts with TBK1 and IRF3 to promote the phosphorylation of IRF3 that leads to type I interferon production. mRNA levels for various IFNs and interferon-stimulated genes were increased by 6-, 12-, and 26-fold. cGAMP is less effective in reducing 2a/JFH1 replicon replication. different genotypes of HCV are known to be differentially sensitive to direct-acting antivirals (6\u20138) the data represent two independent experiments, each with triplicate samples. the open circle and triangle represent c-di-GMP and cGAMP respectively. the dashed line represents the result from 1b/Con1 replicon. NS4Bs from 1b/Con1 and 2a/JFH1 colocalized with STING in 293T cells. this has led us to postulate that NS4Bs from 1b/Con1 and 2a/JFH1 have distinct abilities to inhibit STING-mediated innate immune responses. the cells were transfected with 1b NS4B-HA or 2a NS4B-HA plasmid. the cells were processed for fluorescence microscopy with anti-HA antibody. the cells were transfected with equal amounts of the empty vector or STING-Flag. Western blot analysis of STING accumulation in the presence of NS4B in 293T cells. cells were transfected with fixed amount of STING-Flag along with increasing concentrations of either 1b NS4B-HA or 2a NS4B-HA. cell lysate was subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with Flag- and HA-specific antibodies. a stop codon at amino acid position 22 of NS4B was named 2a NS4B/fs. both WT and 2a NS4B/fs had only modest effects on IRF3 accumulation. this result suggests that 2a NS4B protein, instead of mRNA, is required to suppress STING accumulation. a catalytically inactive NS5B replicated at levels about 5- to 10-fold lower than those of the 2a/JFH1 replicon. in the presence of 75 g/ml cGAMP, the luciferase expression from the 1b/Con1 replicon decreased by 68% to the level of the mock-treated control. a similar inhibitory effect was observed at 72 h posttreatment. luciferase activity was measured and plotted as fold induction relative to the catalytic site mutant GND or GDD. the cells were then mock treated or treated with 75 g/ml of cGAMP for 48 h. replication of J1/C1-B1b was significantly inhibited. replication of J1/C1-C1b was also inhibited by 53%. expression of the chimeric 2a/1b-B protein abrogated the inhibitory effect of 2a NS4B on STING. 293 cells were transfected with increasing concentrations of either 2a NS4B, 1b NS4B, or 2a/1b-B plasmid. the endogenous STING, TBK1, and IRF3 levels were detected by Western blotting. sequences that form helices 1 and 2 and helices 3 and 4 of 2a/1b-B NS4B were replaced with those from 2a NS4B and named 2a/1b-B(1-2) or 2a/1b-B(3-4) NS4B respectively. 2a/1b-B(1-2) and 2a/1b-B(3-4) proteins could partially restore the ability to suppress STING accumulation. chimeric constructs were tested in the STING-mediated IFN- luciferase reporter assay in 293T cells. 2a NS4B inhibited IFN- promoter activation more efficiently than 1b NS4B. 1b/2a-B chimera exhibited the same inhibitory effect as that of 2a NS4B. cGAMP suppresses 1b/Con1-RLuc replication in Huh7.5 cells. cGAMP suppresses 1b/Con1-RLuc replication. cGAMP was measured at 48 h after the addition of either cGAMP or c-di-GMP. cGAMP has inhibitory effects on HCV replication. cGAMP and direct-acting antivirals additively inhibit 1b/Con1 replicon replication. the knockdown by siRNA decreased the STING mRNA and protein levels by 75% and 50%, respectively. the knockdown of STING dramatically diminished the inhibitory effect of cGAMP on 1b/Con1 replicon replication in Huh7.5 cells. asterisk denotes a P value of 0.05. effects of STING knockdown on inhibitory effect of 1b/Con1 replicon replication. black circles and white squares denote cells treated with control siRNA and STING siRNA. cGAMP triggers type I IFN and antiviral ISG expression. cGAMP interacts with TBK1 and IRF3 to promote the phosphorylation of IRF3 that leads to type I interferon production (45). cGAMP activates the host antiviral innate immune response that likely results in the inhibition of 1b/Con1 replication. cGAMP is less effective in reducing 2a/JFH1 replicon replication. different genotypes of HCV are known to be differentially sensitive to direct-acting antivirals (6\u20138) the data represent two independent experiments, each with triplicate samples. the open circle and triangle represent c-di-GMP and cGAMP respectively. the dashed line represents the result from 1b/Con1 replicon. NS4Bs from 1b/Con1 and 2a/JFH1 colocalized with STING in 293T cells. this has led us to postulate that NS4Bs from 1b/Con1 and 2a/JFH1 have distinct abilities to inhibit STING-mediated innate immune responses. the cells were transfected with equal amounts of either 1b NS4B-HA or 2a NS4B-HA plasmid. the cells were transfected with equal amounts of the empty vector or STING-Flag. the cells were transfected with equal amounts of the empty vector or STING-Flag. 293T cells were transfected with a fixed amount of STING-Flag. the cells were transfected with increasing concentrations of either 1b NS4B-HA or 2a NS4B-HA. mRNA of 2a NS4B suppressed STING accumulation in a dose-dependent manner. 2a NS4B/fs mutant dramatically diminished the inhibitory effect. both WT and 2a NS4B/fs had only modest effects on IRF3 accumulation. this result suggests 2a NS4B protein is required to suppress STING accumulation. the replication of the 1b/Con1 replicon was decreased to near background. a similar inhibitory effect was observed at 72 h posttreatment. NS4B proteins from the two different HCV genotypes can affect the inhibition by cGAMP. the luciferase activity was measured and plotted as fold induction relative to the catalytic site mutant GND or GDD. the cells were then mock treated or treated with 75 g/ml of cGAMP for 48 h, and the luciferase activity was determined. replication of J1/C1-B1b was significantly inhibited. the replication of J1/C1-C1b was also inhibited by 53%. expression of the chimeric 2a/1b-B protein abrogated the inhibitory effect of 2a NS4B on STING. 293 cells were transfected with increasing concentrations of either 2a NS4B, 1b NS4B, or 2a/1b-B plasmid. the endogenous STING, TBK1, and IRF3 levels were detected by Western blotting. transmembrane domain helices 1 and 2 and helices 3 and 4 of 2a NS4B were replaced with those from 2a NS4B and named 2a/1b-B(1-2) or 2a/1b-B(3-4) NS4B respectively. 2a/1b-B(1-2) and 2a/1b-B(3-4) proteins could partially restore the ability to suppress STING accumulation. chimeric constructs were tested in the STING-mediated IFN- luciferase reporter assay. 2a NS4B inhibited IFN- promoter activation more efficiently than 1b NS4B. 1b/2a-B chimera exhibited the same inhibitory effect as that of 2a NS4B. cGAS product cGAMP could directly inhibit replication of an RNA virus. cGAMP has been reported to bind the recombinant STING protein with a Kd (dissociation constant) of 5 to 60 nM while c-di-GMP bound to STING with a Kd of 1 to 5 M (34, 35) the inhibition of HCV 2a/JFH1 replication by cGAMP was not as pronounced as that of 1b/Con1. NS4Bs from different genotypes thus have different capacities to evade STING-mediated innate immune responses. dengue virus NS2B/3 can bind and cleave human STING. the inhibitory effect of 2a NS4B was mapped to the B and C domains. the B domain is responsible for the inhibitory effect. NS4Bs from 1b/Con1 and 2a/JFH1 share 77% and 73% amino acid identity. arginine residues in the C domain of NS4B have been shown to be involved in RNA binding. the B domain contains four predicted transmembrane helices."}
