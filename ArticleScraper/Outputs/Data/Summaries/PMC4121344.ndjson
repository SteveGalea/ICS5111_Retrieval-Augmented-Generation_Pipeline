{"summary": "Parkinson\u2019s disease is a recognized progressive neurodegenerative disorder. it is caused by a decrease in the number of dopaminergic neurons located in the substantia nigra (1,2) dying cells bear signs of necrosis, but also of apoptosis, in particular chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation, oxidative damage, mitochondrial dysfunction and caspase activation (3,4) the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway is essential for rescuing neuronal cells from oxidative stress. we therefore hypothesize that GA exerts neuroprotective effects against MPP+-induced cell death. we investigated the inhibitory effects of GA on MPP+-induced cell death. the neurons were dissociated from the cerebral cortex of embryonic rats. they were plated in 96-well culture plates which had been coated with poly-D-lysine (Invitrogen) the cells were maintained in neurobasal medium supplemented with 2% B27 and 1% GlutaMAX (both from Invitrogen). cells were pre-treated with 5\u2013100 M GA for 3 h, co-treated with 0.5 or 4 mM MPP+ for 24 h. a total of 100 l dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added to each well. cell viability was expressed as a percentage of the value in the control group (untreated cells) ine iodide (JC-1; Sigma-Aldrich) was used to measure changes in MMP. the cells were seeded in 12-well plates and allowed to differentiate. the cells were pre-treated with 25 M GA for 3 h. the cells were pre-treated with 25 M GA for 3 h and co-treated with 4 mM MPP+ for a further 12 h. the cells were suspended (1106/ml) in binding buffer and incubated for 10 min with 5 l Anexin V-FITC (20 g/ml) and 10 l PI (50 g/ml) the intensity of the bands was quantified by scanning densitometry. a value of P0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. cell culture PC12 cells were maintained as monolayer cultures in DMEM. the cells were plated in 96-well culture plates which had been previously coated with poly-D-lysine (Invitrogen) the cells were maintained in neurobasal medium supplemented with 2% B27 and 1% GlutaMAX (both from Invitrogen) a total of 100 l dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added to each well. the absorbance was measured using a microplate reader. cell viability was expressed as a percentage of the value. the cells were seeded in 12-well plates and allowed to differentiate. the cells were pre-treated with 25 M GA for 3 h. the cells were co-treated with 4 mM MPP+ for 24 h. the cells were suspended (1106/ml) in binding buffer and incubated for 10 min with 5 l Anexin V-FITC (20 g/ml) and 10 l PI (50 g/ml) at room temperature in the dark. western blot analysis The treated cells were lysed with RIPA buffer. peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies detected using ECL detection kits. intensity of bands was quantified by scanning densitometry using Quantity One 4.5.0 software. a value of P0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. pre-treatment with 25 M GA markedly reversed the morphological damage caused by MPP+. effects of glycyrrhizic acid (GA) against 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+)-induced neurotoxicity in differentiated PC12 cells. cells were pre-treated with 25 M GA for 3 h, followed by exposure to 4 mM MPP+ for (A) 12 or (B) 3 h. data are expressed as a percentage of the corresponding control cells. the ERK, but not the AKT pathway contributes to the GA-mediated neuroprotective effects Exposure to MPP+ significantly suppressed the expression of p-ERK, but not that of t-ERK. treatment with GA (25 M) alone increased the phosphorylation of ERK after 30 min of incubation. phosphorylated ERK (p-ERK) were normalized to the corresponding values of total ERK (t-ERK) and expressed as a percentage of corresponding cells collected at 0 min. data are the means SD of 3 replicate values in 3 separate experiments. pre-treatment with 10 M PD98059, an ERK inhibitor, abrogated the phosphorylation of ERK and increased cell viability. the protective effects of GA (25 M) on cell viability were blocked by PD98059. pre-treatment with 25 M GA for 3 h markedly suppressed the overproduction of LDH induced by MPP+ in the DPC12 cells. increase in apoptotic rate of the MPP+-exposed cells was reversed by pre-treatment with 25 M GA (7.2 vs. 19.1%; Fig. 1C) compared with the MPP+-exposed cells, 25 M GA restored the dissipation of MMP indicated by an increase in the emission of red fluorescence. the results from Fluo-4 AM staining showed that after 3 h of incubation of the PC12 cells, GA mitigated the calcium overload caused by MPP+. glycyrrhizic acid (GA) suppressed the high expression of cleaved PARP caused by 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) differentiated PC12 (DPC12) cells were pre-treated with GA for 3 h and then co-treated with 4 mM MPP+ for 24 h. kinase signaling pathway contributes to glycyrrhizic acid (GA)-mediated neuroprotective effects against 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) kinase signaling pathway is not involved in the glycyrrhizic acid (GA)-mediated neuroprotective effects against 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) cells were pre-treated 25 M GA for 3 h and then collected at 0, 10, 30, 60 and 180 min. data are the means SD of 3 replicate values in 3 separate experiments. further experiments revealed that the GA-induced increase in the phosphorylation of ERK and the improvement in cell viability were markedly abrogated by pre-treatment. discussion PC12 cells, which possess a dopamine synthesis, metabolism and transporting system (22), can shift their phenotype, changing from proliferating, undifferentiated cells into post-mitotic, differentiated, neurite-bearing neurons following incubation with NGF (23). studies have demonstrated that DPC12 cells are more sensitive to neurotoxins (24). treatment with GA resulted in an increase in p-ERK nuclear migration. ERK signaling pathway contributes to the GA-mediated protective effects against MPP+-induced cell damage. excessive cytosolic calcium causes subcellular pathological responses. the accumulation of cells in the G1 phase is considered one of the factors responsible for MPP+-induced cell damage (36). in our study, MPP+-induced G1 phase arrest was observed in the DPC12 cells; however, pre-treatment with GA failed to reverse this effect."}
