{"summary": "enteroviruses (EVs) constitute a large genus of small RNA viruses within the Picornaviridae family. it contains several mammal pathogens, like hepatitis A virus, foot and mouth disease virus, rhinoviruses (RVs) and poliovirus (PV), the etiological agent of poliomyelitis and prototype of EVs. EVs are small non-enveloped viruses containing a single positive-strand RNA genome of approximately 7.5 kb in length. this genome encodes a large open reading frame (ORF) that is translated into a polyprotein processed by viral proteases (2A, 3C, and 3CD) to yield four capsid proteins (VP1-4) and non-structural proteins, such as proteases and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) 3 dVII-spacer 2 region contains the main part of the uORF present in many EV genomes. majority of the EV-A, EV-B and EV-C genomes contain a second upstream overlapping ORF (uORF) however, PV2 and PV3 genomes do not contain an intact uORF. the EV reaches cervical and mesenteric lymph nodes and then establishes a primary viremia. PV invades the CNS, its target organ, in less than 1% of infection. the virus specifically infects and destroys motor neurons, inducing the irreversible flaccid paralyses. recombination occurs at different sites in the two involved genetic fragments. parental RNA genomes are located in the upper panel of (a), (b) and (c) diagrams. recombination occurs at the same site in both parental genomes. RNA recombination enables viruses to quickly explore a greater proportion of the sequence space than is accessible by point mutations. RNA recombination has been shown to be a repair mechanism, essential to maintain viral genome integrity [32,33,34] cVDPVs are inherently genetically unstable and suboptimal vaccine coverage may allow for their circulation among humans not adequately immunized with OPV. since 2000, cVDPVs have caused nearly 30 poliomyelitis outbreaks worldwide. most cVDPVs studied to date have recombinant genomes. recombination frequencies of 106 per site per generation were estimated during co-infection experiments. high recombination frequency is partly due to the fact that EVs display several ecological and biological features that were identified as being necessary for the occurrence of genetic exchanges. a recent study of cells co-infected with two different PV strains showed that the majority of replication complexes contained both viral genomes. the majority of replication complexes contained both viral genomes, early in infection. a recent study in Brome mosaic virus (BMV) showed that the structure and size of the virus membranous replication compartments play a fundamental role on recruitment of multiple RNAs into a contiguous space. two early recombination events at junction of the 5\u2019 UTR and coding region of the species progenitors could explain that current human EV 5\u2019 UTR sequences cluster into two distinct major phylogenetic groups. this work was the first one to suggest the concept of independent evolution of different genome fragments. these results were confirmed by several studies that analyzed and compared the phylogenetic relationships in different genomic regions of prototype and field strains. recombination appears to only occur among members of a given species. frequency and dynamics of recombination seemed to be different between the human EV species. cVDPVs have mosaic genomes composed of mutated OPV sequences. cVDPV genomes showed quadripartite recombinant genomes between OPV and non-PV EV-C sequences. most of the recombinant genomes studied to date displayed similar genetic patterns. most of the cVDPV genomes resulted from the association of several genetic segments from different phylogenetic origins. a schematic view of the genetic organization of the poliovirus genomes is given in the upper panel. the presence of vaccine-derived sequences is indicated. non-vaccine sequences derived from other species C enteroviruses (EV-Cs) are indicated. the location of the putative recombination sites suggests that the 5\u2019 UTR and the capsid-encoding region could be considered as recombination units within which recombination is probably constrained by genetic and/or structural requirements. EV types cannot be considered as \u201csubspecies\u201d with independent evolutionary patterns, but rather EV species would consist of a finite set of capsid genes responsible for different types and a swarm of non-structural protein genes and untran several studies evaluating the circulation and genetic diversity of EVs in restricted geographic areas and on a short period of time revealed an extensive co-circulation of a high number of types from the four human EV species. a recent study showed that certain resident bacteria of the gastrointestinal tract bind PV, increase viral co-infection of mammalian cells and enhance viral recombination. recombinant genomes have to be viable and able to compete with parental genomes. this implies a structural and functional compatibility of the different recombining sequences. this implies a certain tolerance to genomic alterations in order to limit their negative consequences. intertypic recombination events appeared to occur almost entirely outside of the capsid-encoding region [86,107,108,116], which suggests that it is a relatively stable unit. the frequency and dynamics of recombination seemed to be different between the human EV species. cVDPV strains implicated in outbreaks of poliomyelitis in Cambodia [120] and Madagascar [65,70] have mosaic genomes that are composed of mutated OPV sequences and sequences related to non-PV EV-Cs. most of the recombinant cVDPV genomes studied to date displayed similar genetic patterns. cVDPV genomes showed quadripartite recombinant genomes between OPV and non-PV EV-C sequences. the location of the recombination sites, delimiting the genetic segments, matched the preferential recombination regions. the location of the six recombinant hotspots identified by experimental studies of genetic exchanges between poliovirus and enteroviruses is indicated by grey rectangles. the location of the six recombinant hotspots identified by experimental studies of genetic exchanges between poliovirus and enteroviruses is indicated by grey rectangles [77,121,122]. d genes responsible for different types and a swarm of non-structural protein genes and untranslated regions would evolve independently and frequently through RNA recombination during co-infections. this mode of evolution through modular recombination would provide a high level of flexibility and a capacity for very quick evolutionary changes to the EVs. both mechanisms were first described in PV [79,124] the model that was proposed for the copy-choice mechanism postulates that the nucleic acid chain can dissociate from the RNA donor template during replication. this interaction results in the transfer of the replication complex to the new template, where RNA synthesis resumes. the replicative copy-choice model could be confirmed and generalized to other RNA viruses and retroviruses. the elongation complex dissociates from the RNA donor template and the polymerase. the incomplete nascent RNA strand alone dissociates from the elongation complex, interacts with the acceptor RNA, and recruits a new polymerase. in PV, recent findings suggest that the fourth mechanism mentioned above could also be implicated in some cases. the high replication speed of RdRps results in a high incorporation of incorrect nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs), which is associated with an increased number of pause events. recombination sites were often found to be associated with AU-rich sequences in several positive-strand RNA viruses. the sequence identity level between the nascent and acceptor strands is also thought to promote homologous recombination. in PV and BMV, GC-rich sequences could be associated with an increase of recombination frequency in the vicinity of these sequences. this interpretation suggests that thermodynamic factors influence the annealing of the nascent strand to the acceptor RNA to a greater extent than the initial dissociation from the donor template. genomes are recombinant in the dVII-spacer 2 region linking the 5\u2019 UTR to the ppORF. co-transfecting cells with this partner pair only yielded viable viruses when the 5\u2019 partner contained a phosphorylated 3\u2019-nucleotide (3\u2019-P) a majority of homologous recombinant genomes were isolated. cells were co-transfected with unmodified RNA partners, i.e., carrying 5\u2019 triphosphate and 3\u2019-OH ends. when using a 5\u2019 partner with a 3\u2019-P, the activated fragment was entirely incorporated into the genome in most recombinants. this suggests that the mechanism of nonreplicative recombination could be common to several positive-strand RNA viruses. cellular factors that are implicated in nonreplicative RNA recombination have not been identified yet. human cell extracts have been shown to be able to ligate 3\u2019-P-terminated RNA substrates. a positive correlation between RNA concentration and recombination frequency was actually observed in BVDV and HCV. RNA recombination can occur in the absence of a functional RdRp. it does not exclude a replicative mechanism of primer extension that would be mediated by cellular polymerases. a replicative mechanism of primer extension by a host polymerase cannot be fully excluded. the first experimental evidence supporting the copy-choice mechanism was provided in 1986 by Kirkegaard and Baltimore. the replicative copy-choice model could be confirmed and generalized to other RNA viruses and retroviruses. many studies tried to characterize the details of its molecular mechanism. RNA donor and acceptor templates closely hybridize and template switching occurs without dissociation of the elongation complex. recent findings by Kempf et al. on the structure of the 3D polymerase and the elongation complex seem to favor the second possibility mentioned above [135]. secondary structures were identified as recombination hotspots in PV genome. recombination sites were often associated with AU-rich sequences in several positive-strand RNA viruses. the weak annealing of A-U nucleotides is supposed to facilitate dissociation of the nascent strand from the complementary donor strand inside the replication complex. thermodynamic factors influence the annealing of the nascent strand to the acceptor RNA to a greater extent than the initial dissociation from the donor template. studies in tombusvirus and hypovirus led to the identification of various cellular pathways and factors that are involved in viral replicative RNA recombination [166,167,168,169,170]. the possibility for the 3D polymerase to use the 3\u2019 end of the incomplete nascent RNA strand as a primer to be elongated on a new template was also confirmed [131,132,133]. the identification of mutations in the 3D polymerase that negatively or positively affect recombination frequency further supported the replicative recombination mechanism. template switching occurs during negative-strand RNA synthesis [79,138,139], whereas for other viruses, it would either preferentially occur during positive-strand RNA synthesis [140,141] or indifferently between either strand [142,143]. 3.1.2. Factors Influencing Template Switching Many factors are supposed to favor template switching, by having an effect on the pausing of the synthesis on the donor strand. replication complex and nascent strand need to bind the donor template to re-initiate nucleic acid synthesis. first feature identified as a factor that affects recombination frequency and location is sequence identity level between the nascent and acceptor strands. recombination frequency is also thought to promote homologous recombination. the presence of Q replicase required for amplification of the recombinant molecules did not exclude a replicative mechanism. a replicative mechanism not involving the viral polymerase was demonstrated in vivo in PV while using pairs of defective complementary genomic RNA fragments [124,136,173]. co-transfecting cells with this partner pair only yielded viable viruses when the 5\u2019 partner contained a phosphorylated 3\u2019-nucleotide (3\u2019-P) and the 3\u2019 partner harbored a 5\u2019 hydroxyl group (5\u2019-OH) in the case of overlapping RNA fragments, a majority of homologous recombinant genomes were isolated. the details of the mechanisms that lead to the generation of recombinant genomes in the absence of viral RdRp remain unknown. the studies previously mentioned suggest the existence of a common mechanism of breakage-ligation, very likely involving cellular factors. however, the cellular factors that are implicated in nonreplicative recombination have not been identified yet. RNA recombination is linked to the predisposition of RNA to self-assembly. this ability is linked to the predisposition of RNA to self-assembly. this innate capacity for nonenzymatic recombination is thought to have contributed to the RNA world. the presence of Q replicase required for amplification of the recombinant molecules did not exclude a replicative mechanism. a replicative mechanism not involving the viral polymerase was demonstrated in vivo in PV while using pairs of defective complementary genomic RNA fragments. co-transfecting cells with this partner pair only yielded viable viruses when the 5\u2019 partner contained a phosphorylated 3\u2019-nucleotide (3\u2019-P) and the 3\u2019 partner harbored a 5\u2019 hydroxyl group (5\u2019-OH) in the case of overlapping RNA fragments, a majority of homologous recombinant genomes were isolated. the details of the mechanisms that lead to the generation of recombinant genomes in the absence of viral RdRp remain unknown. recombinant RNA fragments could be generated by sporadic bond dissociation or, more likely, by cellular exo- and endoribonucleases. such RNA fragments can actually be produced in vivo, in particular by endoribonucleolytic cleavages. RNA molecules are able to undergo spontaneous nonenzymatic intermolecular transesterification reactions. this ability is linked to the predisposition of RNA to self-assembly. this innate capacity for nonenzymatic recombination is thought to have contributed to the development of the RNA world. similar recombination cellular systems were developed mimicking natural genetic exchanges between EVs. their principle relied on the rescue by recombination of a defective EV RNA genome after co-transfecting cells with an infectious or defective complementary EV genomic RNA. recombination was targeted to a specific genomic region, either the non-structural region [121,122,188] or the 5\u2019 UTR [77] enterovirus genome in which the 3\u2032 end of the 3D polymerase and the entire 3\u2032 UTR were deleted. the 5\u2032 partner is made from the enterovirus genome carrying a deletion in the IRES. the 3\u2032 partner includes the complete 5\u2032 UTR followed by the N-terminal part of the ppORF. homologous recombinant genomes were mostly isolated. most of the isolated genomes showed deletions at the recombination site. however, 33% of the genomes with a recombination site in the 5\u2019 UTR displayed deletions. 570 nucleotides could reach a length of around 148 codons in the non-structural region. none of the natural recombinant EVs reported to date, including cVDPVs, exhibit clear signs of genomic duplications. a Sindbis virus artificially modified in its polymerase was found to overproduce DIs. a single nonhomologous recombinant was shown to be able to generate several different homologous recombinants. a single nonhomologous recombinant was shown to be able to generate several different homologous recombinants. a nonhomologous recombinant genome is produced by a replicative recombination mechanism. experimental studies of recombination in EVs led to the elaboration of a new model for the generation of homologous recombinant EVs. initial nonhomologous recombinants would then evolve into homologous recombinants over one or more subsequent replicative recombination events. this model could be generalized to other positive-strand RNA viruses, as suggested for HCV. the distribution of recombination sites seemed to depend on the type of recombinant. nonhomologous recombination sites were exclusively found in the hotspot sequences. homologous recombination sites could also be found elsewhere in the targeted region. recombination hotspots were identified in EV genomes that were produced in artificial recombination cellular systems. 17 of the 26 genomes of natural cVDPV lineages described to date displayed a recombination site that was located in one of the hotspots experimentally identified in the non-structural region. experimental studies of genetic exchanges between poliovirus and enteroviruses led to the identification of six putative intertypic recombination hotspots. each enterovirus species would exist as a pool of genetic material containing a finite set of P1 regions defining different types. each new enterovirus lineage can be considered as a new association of compatible recombination module. the 5\u2019 UTR and the non-structural region of EVs appeared to be composed of three recombination modules each. these recombination hotspots flank genomic sequences with very low rates of recombination, thus defining \u201crecombination modules\u201d. the modules could then be considered as functional recombination modules. possible combinations of recombination modules generating viable EV genomes could be determined by preferred mutual functional compatibility. a recent study of the patterns of intertypic recombination of Sabin PVs demonstrated that the intrinsically higher/lower relative fitness of the recombination modules also played a significant role. a first study by deep sequencing of both viable and defective homologous recombinants produced by intratypic recombination in PV type 1 (PV1) identified recombination sites located all along the genome. these results suggest that the recombination hotspots previously described might correspond to regions where recombination is more likely to produce viable genomes rather than sequences where recombination is mechanically favored. among the 26 genomes of natural cVDPV lines described to date, 17 displayed a recombination site that was located in one of the three hotspots experimentally identified in the non-structural region. eight recombination sites were located in the VP1-2A hotspot, seven in the 2A-2B hotspot, and two in the 2C-3A hotspot. each enterovirus species would exist as a pool of genetic material. a finite set of regions defining different types and a swarm of nonstructural and untranslated regions. each new enterovirus lineage can be considered as a new association of compatible recombination module. the 5\u2019 UTR and the non-structural region of EVs appeared to be composed of three recombination modules each. the non-coding regions of the CL, of the IRES domains dII to dV and of the domain dVI, and the regions encoding viral proteins 2A, 2BC, and 3ABCD. these genomic recombination modules are exchanged through RNA recombination occurring at the defined hotspots. some of the recombination modules identified correlated with known functional units, like the CL, the IRES and uORF in the 5\u2032 UTR. some of the recombination modules that were identified correlated with known functional units, like the CL, the IRES and uORF in the 5\u2032 UTR, and the 2A and 2BC proteins in the non-structural region. defective RNA partners or with a defective and a replicable RNA partners produced viable recombinant progenies with similar genomic features. this would involve a first recombination step either replicative or nonreplicative, mostly producing nonhomologous recombinant genomes. this would involve rapid evolution through replicative recombination leading to the excision of duplicated regions. a recent large-scale analysis of intertypic recombination patterns in human EV-A, EV-B, and EV-C genomes detected two of the three hotspots that were experimentally identified in the 5\u2032 UTR. the linker sequence between IRES domains dV and dVI, the latter containing the initiation codon of the uORF, and the dVII-spacer 2 region linking the IRES to the ppORF, the location of these two experimentally identified recombination hotspots is consistent with the high flexibility of EV 2A protein previously reported [202,203] phylogenetic studies on circulating human EV genomes reported a more even distribution of recombination sites across the whole P2 and P3 regions. genomes of porcine EV strains from the EV-G species were recently shown to have acquired a functional gene sequence from a Torovirus. these data suggest that the EV genome plasticity might be even higher than previously thought. similar recombination models have been suggested for viruses from the Flaviviridae family [205], for coronaviruses [206] and BMV [207]."}
