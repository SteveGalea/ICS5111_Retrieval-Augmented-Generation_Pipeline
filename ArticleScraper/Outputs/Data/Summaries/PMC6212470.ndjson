{"summary": "the rapid emergence of the antibiotic resistance has endangered the efficacy of antibiotics. there is a need to develop more potent and effective drugs to combat deadly diseases occurring worldwide. in the past few decades, peptide-based therapeutics has been preferred for the drug development. group II peptides can be used for designing epitope-based vaccines or subunit vaccines. these are generally synthetic peptides or subunits of the whole organism commonly known as epitopes. these peptides generate memory cells and hence are very important nowadays for treating pathogenic infections. AMPs represent one of the broadest class of this group. group IV consists of those peptides which could act as a biomarker. peptides obtained from urine have been used as potential biomarkers. the first group includes methods like CAMPR3, APD, AmPEP, and CS-AMPPred which predict whether the given peptide is AMP or non-AMP. the second group includes methods which predict whether the given peptide is AMP or non-AMP. a method called Antifp has been developed for predicting antifungal peptide. it uses features like amino acid composition, binary profile. another method iAMPpred predicts the probability of a peptide as an antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral by providing the probability score for all the three classes. material and Methods Dataset Creation Modified AMPs were extracted from the SATPDB database (Singh et al., 2016) which maintains information about more than 19,000 natural and modified peptides. all those peptides which show any modification (terminus, chemical, and D-amino acids) were assigned as modified AMPs. the negative set consists of those peptides present in the validation dataset. negative set consists of those peptides which are compositionally similar to the positive peptides. atom (a) is one out of 64 diatoms. chemical descriptors represent the correlation between physical, chemical and biological properties of a molecule and its chemical constitution. majority of these chemical descriptors are classified on the basis of their dimensionality. binary profiles of these atoms and symbols were generated. the binary profile was created from terminus (N, C, or both) in case of only atoms, there were total 8 atoms (C, H, O, N, S, F, Cl, and Br) where the presence of atom was represented by \u201c1\u201d and the absence by \u201c0\u201d, thus generating a vector of N 8. different features were calculated using SMILES format (A) binary profile generation of only atoms, (B) binary profile generation of only symbols, (C) binary profile generation of both symbol and atoms, (D) atom composition, and (E) diatom composition. DB database maintains information about more than 19,000 natural and modified peptides. all those peptides which show any modification (terminus, chemical, and D-amino acids), is antimicrobial and whose tertiary structure is present were assigned as modified AMPs. the positive set consists of those peptides present in the validation dataset. negative set consists of those peptides which are compositionally similar to the positive peptides. chemical descriptors represent the correlation between physical, chemical and biological properties of a molecule and its chemical constitution in the form of numerical values. majority of these chemical descriptors are classified on the basis of their dimensionality, which refers to the molecule representation from which descriptor values are calculated. the atomic composition is calculated using formula 1. the diatomic composition provides information about the pairs of atoms in each residue (e.g., C-C, C-O, C-N, etc.) of the peptides. we performed feature selection technique to remove unnecessary descriptors. all descriptors don\u2019t correlate with the biological activity of the molecule. atomic composition was calculated from modified AMPs and non-AMPs. chemical descriptors represent the correlation between physical, chemical and biological properties of a molecule and its chemical constitution in the form of numerical values. majority of these chemical descriptors are classified on the basis of their dimensionality, which refers to the molecule representation from which descriptor values are calculated. binary profiles of atoms, symbols and both from the N and C terminus were generated. the binary profile was created from terminus (N, C, or both) in case of only atoms, there were total 8 atoms (C, H, O, N, S, F, Cl, and Br) where the presence of atom was represented by \u201c1\u201d and the absence by \u201c0\u201d, thus generating a vector of N 8. different features were calculated using SMILES format (A) binary profile generation of only atoms, (B) binary profile generation of both symbol and atoms, (D) atom composition, and (E) diatom composition. performance Measure Performance of models were evaluated using different parameters which can be divided into two groups (i) threshold dependent parameters and (ii) threshold independent parameters. AMPs were found to be slightly higher in \u201cC\u201d atom compared to non-AMPs. non-AMPs were found to be higher in \u201cS\u201d atom compared to AMPs. learning techniques (parameters) Main dataset Validation dataset Sen Spc Acc MCC AUROC Sen Spc Acc MCC AUROC SVM (g = 0.05, c = 15, j = 2) 89.71 86.85 88.29 0.77 0.93 90.53 81.72 86.17 0.73 0.92 Random Forest (ntree = 150) 94.20 85.23 85.23 89.75 0.80 0.96 92.11 82. 87.92 88.36 0.77 0.88 88.95 83.33 86.17 0.72 0.86 J48 (c = 0.25, m = 1) 89.71 83.22 86.49 0.73 0.88 86.84 83.87 85.37 0.71 0.86 Naive Bayes (Default) 87.86 63.09 75.58 0.53 0.74 87.37 62.37 75.00 0.51 0.74 Sen, Sensit c = 2, j = 2) 56.88 65.77 61.29 0.23 0.70 30.53 91.94 60.90 0.28 0.75 SVM after feature selection (g = 0.1, c = 1, j = 1) 84.92 76.38 80.68 0.62 0.85 84.74 74.73 79.79 0.60 0.87 Random Forest (Ntree = 20) 82.01 77.45 79.75 0.60 0.88 83 SVM model developed using complete feature showed the accuracy of 59.59% with MCC of 0.29 on training dataset and accuracy of 59.57% on the validation dataset. model developed on these features showed the higher accuracy of 81.76% and MCC of 0.64 on the training dataset. on the validation dataset, it achieved an accuracy of 82.71% and MCC of 0.65.

AMPs are short innate immunity peptides present in almost all living organism. they act as a universal host defense molecule. AMPs belong to diverse families which include cathelicidins. a large number of databases have been developed which maintain a wide variety of information of AMPs. many of the natural AMPs based drug have not reached clinical trials. this is due to the high structural complexity of the compound, low compound stability, low activity toward the target, compound side effects, degradation of the compound by the host enzyme. molecular descriptors can be calculated easily using 3D structure. these methods have their own limitations including requirement of tertiary structure of peptides. experimental techniques like X-ray crystallography and NMR are time consuming and costly. we created an additional dataset where positive and negative peptides were compositionally similar. binary profile model which considers only atoms and fingerprint-based model performed best and can classify the modified AMPs and non-AMPs with higher accuracy. performance achieved on the independent dataset by the best models developed using different input features is shown in the Figure 5 where we have calculated AUROC.
