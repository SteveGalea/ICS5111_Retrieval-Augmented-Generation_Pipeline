{"summary": "the disease has been etiologically linked to a novel coronavirus. its spike protein (S2) is believed to play a central role in viral entry. the protein responsible for viral-induced membrane fusion of HIV-1 (gp41) differs in length, and has no sequence homology with S2. protein is synthesized as precursors (ENV in Retroviridae, and E2 in Coronaviridae) gp41 contains two heptad repeat (HR) regions, a leucine/isoleucine HR adjacent to its N-terminus (N-HR), and C-HR proximal to the transmembrane domain. the angle between every two consecutive amino acids is 102.9\u00b0. the helical wheel consists of seven corners, corresponding to the fit of seven amino acid residues into every two helical turns. a peptide corresponding to the C-HR of gp41 are potent inhibitors of HIV-1 entry into cells. the genome of the SARS-CoV was recently sequenced [8,9]. it is believed that these peptides exert their anti-viral activity via a dominant negative mechanism by interacting with the central N-HR segment of gp41. this is a promising approach also in developing anti-viral peptides against several paramyxoviruses. helical wheel analysis and protein topology prediction [18] reveal that the SARS-CoV S2 protein consists of the same elements that were characterized in HIV-1 gp41 (Figure 2b) the loop between these two HRs is longer than that of gp41, and is confined by four Cysteine residues. the helical wheel diagram serves as an equivalent to the Spartan scytale. the recipient has a rod of the same diameter, on which he wraps the paper to read the message. in general, SARS-CoV S2 and HIV-1 gp41 share the hairpin structure. anti-fusion therapeutic approach used against HIV-1 may be adapted to the case. Peptides derived from the C-HR segment of SARS-CoV S2 protein may inhibit viral induced membrane fusion. protein sequences SARS-CoV genomic sequence information (NC_004718) was retrieved from GenBank at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) this precursor is believed to be post-translationally processed to reveal S1 and S2 as confirmed in other Coronaviridae viruses."}
