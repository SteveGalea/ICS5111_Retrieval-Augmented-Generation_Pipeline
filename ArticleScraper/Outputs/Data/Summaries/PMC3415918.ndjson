{"summary": "multipartite viruses have their genomes fragmented into two or more (up to eight) segments. each genomic segment must be completed (i.e. complemented) with the rest of segments in order to produce viral offspring. a noticeable fact about multipartite viruses is their asymmetry in host distribution. the effect of DIPs in the dynamics and evolution of viruses has been studied by means of mathematical models [15,16] the advantage of fragmentation and especially the individual encapsidation of the fragments still remain open questions. recent experimental work has compared the performance of the wt, complete form of foot-and-mouth disease virus with a fragmented (bipartite) counterpart. a set of segments may be able to outcompete the wt virus if the MOI is high enough to guarantee complementation among the segments. we will focus on reduced degradation as the selective pressure favouring segmentation. alternatives will also be considered, and their formal equivalence investigated. incomplete genomes (1 and 2) have an average lifetime that is larger than that of the wt between infective events. the process is iterated until the equilibrium state is attained. at generation n, the composition of the population will be denoted as pn. wt genomes do not need complementation, and their final number will depend only on their initial abundance c. the next step is to obtain the global offspring produced by the whole set of cells. the probability of a given infection configuration depends on the MOI m. conditional fitness (equation) can be written in the form of a replicator equation. the evolution equation is equivalent to the replicator equation 2.7 where 2.8 The evolutionary dynamics must fulfil the equilibrium condition 2.9. bipartite mutants have a higher probability of error-free copy than wt ones. in addition, single-segment viruses can be produced from the wt with probability. selective advantage favouring shorter genome lengths is proportional to the number of segments that a given class contains. in the case of degradative advantage, degradation is assumed to be zero for the single-segment classes. the amount of viruses produced by a single cell depends on the initial composition of the (small) infecting population. it is exposed then to differential degradation, which preferentially affects the wt class. the viral population that results after degradation is considered to be the infecting population for the next generation. the fitness matrix allows the introduction of frequency-dependent fitness. the number of genomes of a given class produced inside a cell is equal to the minimum between the number of genomes of that class that infected the cell and the number of corresponding complementary genomes. differential degradation is applied by multiplying the global offspring by a degradation matrix D that takes the form of a diagonal matrix with value one in the first two positions (corresponding to 1 and 2) and 1 in the third position (reduced survival for the wt), 2.4 All steps can be written in a single equation that provides the composition of the population in successive generations. the selective advantage of the bipartite mutants is due to reduced degradation. in a discrete-time model, R1 is the average number of genomes of wt class produced after one cycle of intracellular replication. the conditional fitness that allow the evolutionary process to be written as a replicator equation is the following: 2.10 (ii) bipartite genomes may replicate faster than wt ones [11,19] without loss of generality, let R > 1 be the replication rate of the segments 1 and 2 relative to that of the wt. the conditional fitness that allow the evolutionary process to be written as a replicator equation is the following: 2.10 (ii). in a multiple-segment model, viral classes are defined by the genomic segments they conserve. extreme cases are still the wt virus, which contains the complete genome, and the single-segment classes, which constitute the genuine multipartite version of the virus. equation reveals two possible outcomes for the evolutionary process. if degradation of the wt is high enough when compared with that of the segments, then the wt becomes extinct and single-segment variants 1 and 2 take over the population. coexistence is the expected outcome if degradation of the wt is low. the key point is to study its stability when an infinitesimal amount of wt is introduced. the equilibrium point becomes unstable at a critical value = crit. the critical value separating coexistence from extinction of the wt can be written in terms of modified Bessel functions of the first kind I(m) the conditional fitness defined by equation (2.10) can be used to derive an analogous critical condition such that crit is replaced by RG. in the latter, crit is substituted by (1 )G. the critical condition is derived from a slightly more involved mathematical relationship. a single segment, translates into a relative survival of 50 per cent for two-segment classes. that can be enough for the two-segment classes to avoid extinction at a not very high MOI. the possibility that such a high MOI can be reached in nature is clearly unrealistic. no multipartite virus with more than three or four segments should be expected. this result remains unchanged if the advantage of segmented forms is proportional to the volume they occupy. in this regime bipartite variants of a single-particle virus are able to outcompete the latter and reach fixation in the population. an analytic expression for the critical value crit can be obtained by simple invasibility arguments. the key point is to study its stability when an infinitesimal amount of wt is introduced. the equilibrium point becomes unstable at a critical value = crit. regions corresponding to coexistence and extinction of wt are separated by a series of critical points. the results obtained earlier remain qualitatively unchanged if the selective advantage of the bipartite virus relies on a faster replication or mutations leading to the loss of segments are considered. the minimum survival for the wt virus, 0 per cent related to that of a single segment, translates into a relative survival of 50 per cent for two-segment classes. this can be enough for the two-segment classes to avoid extinction at a not very high MOI. if the selection pressure favouring shorter genomes is stronger, then critical MOIs decrease (two for two segments, nine for three segments), but still remain above 100 for five or more segments. if the evolutionary origin of multipartite viruses is due to genome segmentation and competition among genomes of different lengths, no multipartite virus with more than three or four segments should be expected. d forms and extinction of the wt are essentially unchanged when the production of viral particles is limited by the amount of cellular resources. this leads us to conclude that it is how the complementation rules are implemented that eventually determines the equilibrium state, and not the absolute number of viral particles produced. other models for complementation [26] have analysed the case of gene products acting only in trans. a related work [19] considered differences in replicative ability and replication fidelity as the selective pressures driving genome segmentation. for high enough MOI, it was found that defective mutants were able to invade a population of bipartite virus, driving it to extinction. this phenomenon is conceptually similar to that of lethal defection [29,30] and has not been considered in our model for simplicity. the onset of viral infections in animals, as well as intra-host dispersal, are processes that involve a very small number of viral particles [32,33], too small for a multipartite virus to achieve efficient infection. asymmetry in the host distribution of multipartite viruses may derive from differences in the characteristic MOIs for plants and animals. a second hypothesis consists of accepting that there has been only one (or maybe two) true segmentation event, favourably selected by a moderate MOI, and the rest of segments have been recruited as genes captured from other viruses. interspecific recombination and gene transfer events are widespread in multipartite viruses. multipartite viruses belong to the families Geminiviridae, Secoviridae and Bromoviridae. some of the multipartite viruses found in nature present a much larger number of segments. this value is very unlikely to be attained in nature. other conceptual frameworks are needed to explain the origin of these highly multipartite viruses. ation and gene transfer events are widespread in multipartite viruses. they are thought to have played a role in the particular evolution of nanoviruses."}
