{"summary": "contemporary studies describing CAP etiology and outcome from the region are either small, retrospective, or only use limited investigations to define etiology. current CAP management protocols applied in sub-Saharan Africa are therefore inadequately informed by contemporary data. CAP mortality is high compared with populations from well-resourced settings with similar age profiles. CAP mortality is high compared with populations from well-resourced settings with similar age profiles. death from CAP is poorly predicted by commonly used CAP severity-assessment tools, such as CURB65. radiographic assessment Chest radiographs were performed as early as possible after admission and independently reported by two radiologists and a study clinician using a standardized form. a consensus report of the three assessors was used for analysis. pleural fluid samples were sent for Gram stain, aerobic culture, mycobacterial microscopy and culture, and pneumococcal antigen testing. statistical analysis Statistical analyses were performed with Stata version 12.1 (StataCorp) sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, positive and negative likelihood ratios, and area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve with 95% confidence intervals. details of how scores were calculated for each severity-assessment tool are provided in the online supplement. radiographic assessment Chest radiographs were performed as early as possible after admission. a consensus report of the three assessors was used for analysis.
