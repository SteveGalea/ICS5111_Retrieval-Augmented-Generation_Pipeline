{"summary": "in the loosest sense, the term 'outbreak' refers to any increase in the incidence of a given infection, which can occur in response to local, societal or environmental changes. in the strictest sense, the term implies a series of infections caused by indistinguishable or closely linked isolates, which are sufficiently similar to justify talking about 'an outbreak strain' outbreaks are often linked to social factors, including mass travel, migration, conflict or societal breakdown, or to environmental threats. outbreaks can be propagated by human-to-human spread or, in the case of zoonoses, such as swine or bird flu, can result from the spread to humans from animal reservoirs. airborne, point source Legionnaire's disease July 2012 Stoke on Trent, UK 10 cases Likely source a hot tub Airborne, propagated human-to-human Measles 2012 to now south Wales, UK >2,000 cases Perhaps related to waning immunity in adults Airborne, propagated human-to-human Bovine tuberculosis 2006 Birmingham, UK 10 cases Spread through social links, including nightclub Blood-borne Hepatitis B 2011 Swansea, UK 4 cases Link between cases unclear Blood traditional epidemiology can often track down the source of an outbreak. a case-control study can identify the foodstuff responsible for a food-poisoning outbreak. the laboratory also offers epidemiological typing, which provides an assessment of how closely cases are related to each other. YATM for 'yet another typing method' [12] and to pioneer the adoption of sequence-based approaches, notably multilocus sequence typing. differences in stretches of DNA sequence from conserved housekeeping genes are used to assign bacterial isolates to sequence types. results from one laboratory can be easily compared with those from others around the world. high-throughput sequencing, especially with the arrival of bench-top sequencers, brings methodologies for bacterial WGS that are simple, quick and cheap enough to fall within the remit of an average-sized clinical or research laboratory. by delivering a definitive catalog of genetic polymorphisms (especially single-nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs), WGS delivers far greater resolution than traditional methods. how whole-genome sequencing contributes to each step in outbreak investigation Step contribution of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) References Confirming the existence of an outbreak Bench-top sequencing of whole bacterial genomes in near real time. whole bacterial genomes could be used in near real time to confirm or refute the existence of outbreaks of MRSA or C. difficile in an acute hospital setting. the genome sequences from an apparent cluster of C. difficile infections turned out to be unrelated and so did not represent an outbreak sensu stricto. this approach provides an exciting new approach to the identification and characterization of outbreak strains that does away with the need for laboratory culture. a strain of C. difficile was recurrence in a hospital after more than 3 years of absence. it may be possible to hypothesize what determinants underlie the success of an outbreak strain. in some cases, it may be possible to hypothesize what determinants underlie the success of an outbreak strain. whole-genome sequences of humans are available and being used to study population genetic risks for diseases. a retrospective analysis of tuberculosis cases in the English Midlands allowed them to define cut-offs in the number of SNPs that could be used to rule isolates in or out of a recent transmission event. inferences can enable the identification of sources or reservoirs of infection. examples include the acquisition of leprosy by humans from wild armadillos and the acquisition of Mycobacterium bovis in cattle from sympatric badger populations. phylogeny has allowed the origins and spread of pandemics and epidemics to be traced. genome sequences from an apparent cluster of C. difficile infections turned out to be unrelated and so did not represent an outbreak sensu stricto [25]. this approach has been used to identify the causes of outbreaks of viral infection that does away with the need for laboratory culture or target-specific enrichment. genome-scale sequencing can act as a precursor to the development of simpler specific tests that can be used in case definition. inferences from sequence data (such as on phylogeny, transmissibility, virulence or resistance) can be integrated with clinical and environmental metadata. resistance phenotype from genotype has been applied routinely for years to viral pathogens such as human immunodeficiency virus. data are accumulating from S. aureus [36] and from E. coli strains that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases showing that WGS can be used to predict the resistance phenotype in bacteria. a retrospective genomic analysis of strains from a meningococcal outbreak allowed chains of transmission to be identified. this study pioneered the automated comparison of WGS data using a new public database, the Bacterial Isolate Genome Sequence Database (BIGSdb) high-throughput sequencing studies provide clear evidence that capsule switching is occurring in pneumococcal populations in response to vaccination, which has implications for disease control and vaccine design. whole-genome sequence data must be readily accessible in a portable, easily stored and searched, user-friendly format. difficult to devise stable and agreed standard operating procedures. need for standardized, robust, user-friendly analysis pipelines. need to move beyond SNP typing of draft genomes of colony-purified isolates. a large number of epidemiologically linked and unlinked cases in a given lineage will it be possible to define cut-offs for the genomic differences that allow linked and unlinked cases to be accurately defined. only when WGS data have been obtained from a large number of epidemiologically linked and unlinked cases in a given lineage will it be possible to define cut-offs for the genomic differences. clinical diagnostic metagenomics will deliver improved genomic epidemiological information, including insights into within-patient pathogen population genetics and identification and typing of non-culturable or difficult-to-culture organisms. the future of bacterial outbreak investigation will rely on a new paradigm of genomics and metagenomics."}
