{"summary": "primary care is the cornerstone of an effective health care system. many developed countries have striven to establish and strengthen their primary care systems. but the primary care system in south Korea is not yet well-established. primary care is defined as care that is provided by regular doctors as a usual source of care (USC), which is characterized by comprehensive first contact, person-focused continuity, and care coordination across health care providers. research related to USC in south Korea is just beginning compared to the large body of international research. the bottom 10% of household income was defined as the lowest, between 10% and 50% as the lower, between 50% and 90% as the middle, and the top 10% as the high. alcohol intake of more than an average of seven drinks daily for men and five drinks daily for women at least twice a week was defined as the high-risk drinking. we estimated potential-outcome means (POMs) and average treatment effect (ATE) in the general population, patients with hypertension, and those with diabetes mellitus (DM) each subject had two potential outcomes. one outcome would manifest if the subject were exposed to the treatment. another outcome would manifest if the same subject were exposed to the control. the bottom 10% of household income was defined as the lowest, between 10% and 50% as the lower, between 50% and 90% as the middle, and the top 10% as the high. alcohol intake of more than an average of seven drinks daily for men and five drinks daily for women at least twice a week. each subject had two potential outcomes. one outcome would manifest if the subject were exposed to the treatment. the difference between these two means of potential outcomes was defined as the ATE. the bottom 10% of household income was defined as the lowest, between 10% and 50% as the lower, between 50% and 90% as the middle, and the top 10% as the high. differences in the distribution of observed baseline covariates between treatment and control groups may occur. RESULTS 1. Baseline Characteristics of the study population Overall, 15.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 15.3 to 16.5) of the study population was 65 years of age and over, 51.6% (95% CI, 50.8 to 52.6) were women, 15.6% (95% CI, 14.9 to 16.3) had a regular doctor, 6.8% (95% CI, 6.4 to 7.3) had DM, 17.6% (95% CI, 16.9 to 18.3) had hypertension, and 23. in patients with DM, the POMs of ER visit rates in the treatment and control groups were 8.2% and 13.1%, respectively. the group with a regular doctor had a 5.0% lower ER visit rate than the control group. in patients with hypertension, the POMs for ER visit in the treatment and control groups were 9.5% and 11.3%, respectively. the group with a regular doctor had a 1.8% lower ER visit rate than the control group. establishing primary care systems were 88% in Australia, 84% in Canada, 92% in Germany, 100% in the Netherlands, 89% in the united kingdom, and 80% in the USA. a regular doctor was more effective than a regular site for providing blood pressure checks, cholesterol level checkups, and influenza vaccines. countries with strong primary care may have lower overall health care costs and healthier populations. the insignificant ATE in the general population and patients with hypertension may be due to this problem. however, we did not consider the fact that the qualities and characteristics of the regular doctor such as comprehensiveness, care coordination, and individual-focused continuity may affect ER visits. Heterogeneity and Endogeneity in the future need to proceed."}
