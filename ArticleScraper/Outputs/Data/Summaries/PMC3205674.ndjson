{"summary": "traditional uses of Echinacea Herbal medicines were in use throughout the plains of northamerica long before the introduction of European medicines. nine discrete species were classified subsequently by botanists, as indicated in Table 1. even in recent years there have been revisions in the taxonomy of the genus. the source material for scientific and clinical studies is usually an aqueous ethanol tincture/extract of aerial parts of the dried plant or roots. the chemical composition differs substantially between such preparations, at least in terms of the known \u201cmarker compounds\u201d such as caffeic acid derivatives, alkylamides, and polysaccharides. however, the problem has been exacerbated by the frequent use of uncharacterized source material. oviruses and bocaviruses may also be involved in the generation of respiratory symptoms [10]. oviruses and bocaviruses may also be involved in the generation of respiratory symptoms. oviruses and bocaviruses may also be involved in respiratory symptoms. no membrane \u2013 \u2013 Herpes viruses ds DNA + membrane + + Data from [11\u201313] another problem with the specific antiviral target approach is the inevitable emergence of virus resistant mutants [14, 15] and their subsequent spread through the community and environment. a logical alternative approach is the use of a noncytotoxic agent that has the capacity to inhibit many different respiratory viruses simultaneously. kinin gene expression is more likely a delayed effect of virus infection. a more rational therapeutic approach would be the application of anti-inflammatory agents. a potential safe anti-inflammatory agent also contains multiple antiviral activities. influenza A virus originated in wild birds, possibly waterfowl such as ducks and geese. classical symptoms of human influenza include cough, malaise, and fever, often accompanied by sore throat, nasal obstruction, and sputum production. more serious disease in healthy individuals is often accompanied by excessive overreaction of the innate immune response with the secretion of dangerous levels of cytokines. antiviral activities of Echinacea Purpurea (EP) were distributed among more than one solvent derived fraction. a purified polysaccharide fraction from EP possessed no significant activity. some, but not all, of the antiviral activities were due to photosensitizers. EF at 1 : 10 dilution (equivalent to 1.6 mg/mL dry weight/volume) was capable of killing at least 105 infectious viruses by direct contact. EP was found to be much less effective against intracellular virus. influenza viruses, corona viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, and certain adenoviruses are among the possible viral targets. despite the variety of replication schemes among these viruses the chances of success for a single therapeutic drug are low. influenza viruses segmented RNA, + membrane & 2 target virion proteins (HA, NA), nt syncytial virus ss RNA, no membrane + high conc. and high conc. another problem with the specific antiviral target approach is the inevitable emergence of virus resistant mutants. invading virus first encounters epithelial tissues, composed largely of epithelial cells and occasional dendritic cells and macrophages. these cells respond by means of antimicrobial strategies that make up the innate immune system, including defense peptides and the secretion of various proinflammatory cytokines. other molecules such as kinins are released and are probably responsible for some of the early symptoms. influenza viruses are ubiquitous and produce significant annual morbidity and mortality across the world, with potentially devastating consequences for human and animal health. influenza A virus originated in wild birds, possibly waterfowl such as ducks and geese and that these birds act as reservoirs and vectors for the many known subtypes (strains) of influenza A virus [35] many antiviral drugs for use in infected patients have been tested experimentally, in animal models and in humans, but none has proven satisfactory. a purified polysaccharide fraction from EP possessed no significant activity, while cichoric acid and several caffeic acid derivatives showed only weak to moderate activity. ethanol extracts of E. purpurea, 95% aerial parts plus 5% roots showed that this preparation was a very potent virucidal agent against several viruses with membranes. EF at 1 : 10 dilution was capable of killing at least 105 infectious viruses by direct contact. rhinovirus and feline calicivirus were also equally susceptible at the relatively high concentrations of EF recommended for oral consumption. the susceptibility of other viruses to EP indicates there must be additional molecular targets. other viruses, including adenovirus type 3 and 11, stimulated the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. adenoviruses, which are not vulnerable to direct attack by Echinacea, were still susceptible to cytokine reversal. cytokine induced production of cytokines and chemokines was suppressed to various degrees by EP extracts and some constituent alkylamides. mucin secretion of excessive mucus is one of the more annoying symptoms of colds and other respiratory infections and occurs frequently in chronic pulmonary infections. many pharmaceuticals have been designed to relieve this feature of an infection, usually with the accompaniment of undesirable side effects. EP and rhinovirus RV1A were treated with combinations of EP and rhinovirus RV1A. supernatants were assayed for secreted MUC5A by ELISA. this condition was confirmed for EP by means of a commercial source of normal human airway epithelium. treatment IL-6 IL-8 MUC5A EP 0.7 1.5 0.82 Rhinovirus 3.1 22.0 2.0 EP + rhinovirus 0.5 2.0 0.76 Data from [55], 55. both extracts influenced the expression of many genes, including cytokine genes. failed to detect IFN, in contrast to cells stimulated by the known IFN inducer poly I : C (Vimalanathan and Hudson, unpublished data), from which authors concluded that EP induced little if any IFN alpha or beta. consequently antiviral effects of EP are not likely to involve the interferon system. streptococcus pyogenes (Group A streptococcus, or GAS) is responsible for widespread infections ranging from mild cases of pharyngitis to more severe toxic shock syndromes and necrotizing fasciitis (flesh-eating disease) several Streptococcal gene products or virulence factors have been described which aid the bacteria in persistence in oral epithelia and saliva. Klebsiella pneumoniae, often associated with antibiotic resistant pneumonia, was also relatively resistant to the bactericidal effects of EP. different preparations of Echinacea showed markedly different effects on bacteria, indicating that EP has distinct mechanisms of action against each bacterium. a number of interesting studies have suggested possible mechanisms. Rhinoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza virus altered signaling pathways in cultured epithelial cells. the reverse process was also demonstrated; prior infection of epithelial cells with H. influenzae increased the level of ICAM-1 receptors. several EP preparations showed potent virucidal activity against HSV. the advantages of EP are its broad spectrum of activity, which minimizes the chances of resistant mutants arising, and its high potency. bacterial-induced cytokines included IL-6 and IL-8 (CXCL8), and to a lesser extent TNF. a combination of cytokines could well explain the production of inflammation at the site of the infection. an agent capable of safely reversing this effect should be beneficial to the patient. herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 (HSV-1/2) are common infections of oral and genital mucosa (cold sores) and \u201cgenital sores\u201d) and may become chronic infections with painful recurrent eruptions of the skin. some of these could be amenable to topical treatment with EP. cytokines and other inflammatory mediators are hallmarks of inflammatory responses. inflammatory responses include IL-6 and IL-8 (CXCL8), and to a lesser extent TNF. a combination of cytokines could explain the production of inflammation at the site of infection. tokine/chemokine Ratio, P. acnes/control Ratio, P. acnes + EP/control IL-6 7.0 2.7 IL-8 (CXCL8) 3.0 0.35 GRO 1.9 0.56 TNF 1.2 0.52 Data from [82]. a limited number of studies have been reported on antifungal activity of various Echinacea extracts, including some EP extracts, against Candida species and some dermatophytes. parasites Leishmaniasis and trypanosomiasis are diseases caused by protozoans Leishmania and trypanosoma species. trypanosoma species are transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected female phlebotomine sandfly. L. donovani showed proinflammatory activity by stimulating the secretion of IL-6 and IL-8 (CXCL8) in two different human cell lines a bronchial epithelial line and a skin fibroblast line. in both cell types, the selected EP ethanol extract inhibited these Leishmania-induced responses. thus certain Echinacea preparations are capable of controlling growth of these parasites, and can inhibit the inflammatory activity induced by them. it has been reported that EP supplementation to the diet can apparently cause changes in gut bacterial flora [87] but it is not clear how significant such changes are and whether they are beneficial. parasites Leishmaniasis and trypanosomiasis are diseases caused by protozoans Leishmania and trypanosoma species. EP preparations exhibited dose-dependent anti-leishmanial and trypanocidal activities after 24, 48, and 72 h incubation. the mode of action of EP on these parasites is not known. it may differ between species, as it does for bacterial species. several studies have reported the effects of Echinacea preparations on cellular gene expression in uninfected human cells relevant to the immune system. a butanol fraction, derived from aerial parts of E. purpurea, was influenced by the nature of the Echinacea preparation. incubation of peritoneal, alveolar, or spleen monocyte/lymphocyte preparations with EP resulted in stimulation of phagocytosis and cytokine secretion. this was in contrast to the studies described above for infected airway epithelial cells and fibroblasts. earlier studies gave rise to a popular belief that Echinacea acted as a general \u201cimmune stimulant\u201d or \u201cimmune booster\u201d. inflammatory mediator nitric oxide and EP inhibited this effect [92] in accordance with the anticytokine effects described above. similar cells that have already been stimulated by LPS (or possibly by live bacteria) are inhibited by EP, indicating the tendency of EP to restore normal immune functions. veterinary applications Most domestic animals, including pets, livestock, and fish, require treatment for viral and microbial diseases. some of these organisms should be responsive to Echinacea treatment, either as direct antivirals, antimicrobials, or as an anti-inflammatory agent. some commentators have pointed out the need to evaluate herbal preparations as replacement for at least part of the antibiotic onslaught that farmed animals often receive. dietary EP was found to offer no protection against the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRS virus) this virus is a member of the arterivirus family (related to coronaviruses) it would be expected to be susceptible to direct contact with EP. however the systemic nature of the infection could render it inaccessible to dietary Echinacea components. the novel coronavirus responsible (SARS CoV) was isolated and its genome quickly sequenced. however no satisfactory antiviral therapy was or is available. a more recent review emphasized the role of innate immune responses to the virus infection. some commercial preparations of Echinacea, including those with EP, comprise mixtures of EP with other non-Echinacea herbs. in general ethanol-based extracts had greater antiviral activities than aqueous extracts; but it was not possible to identify a specific component responsible for the activity. there was no correlation between antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities. studies have been carried out in humans, with the aim of preventing or treating common colds. despite reservations there was an overall trend towards beneficial effects of the Echinacea, but equally importantly the safety of the preparations was confirmed repeatedly, including trials in children. some Echinacea extracts manifestly contain compounds, or combinations of compounds, with the ability to interact specifically with viral and microbial targets [13, 17, 62, 128] these extracts can inhibit the virus/bacterium-induced secretion of cytokines/chemokines and other inflammatory mediators that were responsible for the pulmonary symptoms. these bioactivities result from changes in gene expression. a combination of these beneficial activities could reduce the amount of viable pathogens."}
