{"summary": "innate antiviral responses represent the first line of defense against invading viral pathogens. one of these PAMPs, viral cytosolic RNA, can be detected by RLRs. secreted IFN-/ triggers the transcription of interferon-stimulated genes. many viruses encode proteins with specialized functions to evade innate antiviral responses. a well-studied example is the Influenza A virus NS1 protein, which shields viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) from detection by both RLRs and PKR. this virus is believed to be transmitted to humans primarily via animal hosts, most likely dromedary camels. there is firm evidence that MERS-CoV inhibits IFN-/ production. several viral proteins have been implicated in this evasion mechanism. but the inhibitory effect of these proteins on innate antiviral responses has thus far only been demonstrated in transfected cells expressing these viral proteins. despite efficient virus infection and replication, no SGs were observed at any of the indicated time points. lack of SGs was not due to an intrinsic defect in the stress response pathway of vero cells. transfection of pEGFP plasmid DNA in HeLa cells triggered SG formation in a PKR-dependent manner. this phenomenon was not restricted to the pEGFP plasmid as all plasmids with eukaryotic promoters induced SG formation in our HeLa cells. this phenomenon was not restricted to the pEGFP plasmid as all plasmids with eukaryotic promoters induced SG formation in our immunofluorescence images of HeLa cells transfected with pEGFP expression plasmids. cells were fixed at 24h post transfection and stained for G3BP1. differences in relative dsRNA intensity levels were analyzed using an unpaired t-test (**, p0.01). the absence of SG formation coincided with a lack of PKR phosphorylation. we also tested the ability of these MERS-CoV accessory proteins to suppress the stress response pathway. the inhibitory effect of p4a, as well as that of NS1, was less pronounced. p4a rescues protein translation upon plasmid DNA transfection-mediated stress. p4a fails to inhibit PKR-independent stress pathway activation. IAV NS1 failed to inhibit PKR-independent SG formation [30]. a small reduction in PKR-independent SG formation was observed in cells overexpressing p4a. however, lack of SGs was only observed in cells expressing very high levels of p4a. expression of p4a affected SG formation only in a small fraction of the cells. p4a can functionally replace the PKR antagonist of a picornavirus. transfection procedures fail to mimic the dynamic interplay between dsRNA and the antagonist, both of which gradually appear over time during the viral life cycle. also, transfection may yield non-physiologically high levels of viral proteins. recombinant viruses were generated expressing p4a or NS1 protein. EMCV wt infection did not induce SG formation while EMCV-L-Zn induced SG formation in 20% of the cells. this reduction was not due to differences in infection efficiency, since Strep2-tagged proteins were detected in majority of cells. capsid staining was used as a control for virus replication efficiency. tubulin staining was used as loading control and Strep-tag staining showed expression of the MERS-CoV p4a and IAV NS1. dsRNA binding motif in MERS-CoV p4a is crucial for suppressing SG formation. infection of HeLa cells with recombinant EMCV-L-Zn viruses resulted in efficient SG formation, indicating a complete loss of the stress-antagonizing function. dsRNA binding motif in p4a is crucial for suppressing SG formation. western blot analysis of PKR and phospho-PKR in cells infected with indicated viruses. expression of p4a also suppresses IFN-/ pathway activation in transiently transfected cells. p4a and NS1 significantly suppressed transcription of IFN mRNA. plasmids encoding EGFP fusion proteins were co-transfected with a plasmid conferring puromycin resistance. RT-qPCR was used to quantify relative IFN mRNA levels 8h post RNA ligand transfection. replication of EMCV-L-Zn under low MOI infection conditions is severely impaired in HeLa-wt cells. replication was fully rescued to the level of EMCV wt in HeLa-PKRKO cells. comparison of replication efficiency of recombinant viruses expressing p4a or the p4a mutant showed that the antagonistic activity of p4a provided a clear fitness advantage in HeLa-wt cells. RNA was isolated at 8h post infection and relative IFN mRNA levels were quantified by RT-PCR. RT-PCR was used to amplify the MERS-CoV 4a insert. Upon low MOI infection, EMCV-L-Zn rapidly outgrew EMCV-L-Zn in HeLa-wt cells but not in HeLa-PKRKO cells. wt 4a PCR fragment is absent in mutant 4a gene. the virus replicated better than the virus expressing mutant p4a. in PKRKO cells only a minor advantage was observed. p4a encodes at least one other suppressor of the stress response pathway. no increase in IFN mRNA levels was observed in Huh7 cells infected with MERS-CoV or MERS-CoVORF4. RT-qPCR was used to quantify relative IFN mRNA levels at the indicated time points. the lack of SGs was not due to an intrinsic defect in the stress response pathway of vero cells. the lack of SGs was not due to an intrinsic defect in the stress response pathway of vero cells as clear SGs were formed upon arsenic acid treatment. transfection of pEGFP plasmid DNA in HeLa cells triggered SG formation in a PKR-dependent manner. this phenomenon was not restricted to the pEGFP plasmid as all plasmids with eukaryotic promoters induced SG formation in our HeLa cells. this phenomenon was not restricted to the pEGFP plasmid as all plasmids with eukaryotic promoters induced SG formation in our intensity levels are plotted relative to that of the non-transfected cells. cells were classified as non-transfected or transfected based on EGFP expression. differences in relative dsRNA intensity levels were analyzed using an unpaired t-test. the absence of SG formation coincided with a lack of PKR phosphorylation. we also tested the ability of these MERS-CoV accessory proteins to suppress the stress response pathway. the inhibitory effect of p4a, as well as that of NS1, was less pronounced. p4a rescues protein translation upon plasmid DNA transfection-mediated stress. p4a fails to inhibit PKR-independent stress pathway activation. p4a shields dsRNA from detection by PKR. a small reduction in PKR-independent SG formation was observed in cells overexpressing p4a. however, lack of SGs was only observed in cells expressing very high levels of p4a. however, a moderate expression level of p4a was already sufficient to inhibit PKR-mediated SG formation. p4a can functionally replace the PKR antagonist of a picornavirus. transfection procedures fail to mimic the dynamic interplay between dsRNA and the antagonist. also, transfection may yield non-physiologically high levels of viral proteins. EMCV wt infection did not induce SG formation while EMCV-L-Zn induced SG formation in 20% of the cells. this reduction was not due to differences in infection efficiency. in fact, SGs were only observed in cells displaying low expression levels of p4a or NS1. capsid staining was used as a control for virus replication efficiency. tubulin staining was used as loading control and Strep-tag staining showed expression of the MERS-CoV p4a and IAV NS1. PKR levels were significantly reduced in EMCV-infected cells. binding domain in complex with its ligand [34], we designed a second mutant containing a single substitution (Q9P) in another part of the conserved dsRNA-binding motif. infection of HeLa cells with recombinant EMCV-L-Zn viruses expressing these mutants resulted in efficient SG formation. dsRNA binding motif in MERS-CoV p4a is crucial for suppressing SG formation. expression of p4a also suppresses IFN-/ pathway activation in transiently transfected cells. p4a and NS1 significantly suppressed transcription of IFN mRNA. this function also requires its dsRNA-binding activity. plasmids encoding EGFP fusion proteins were co-transfected with a plasmid conferring puromycin resistance. RT-qPCR was used to quantify relative IFN mRNA levels 8h post RNA ligand transfection. replication of EMCV-L-Zn under low MOI infection conditions is severely impaired in HeLa-wt cells, whereas replication was fully rescued to the level of EMCV wt in HeLa-PKRKO cells. comparison of the replication efficiency of recombinant viruses expressing p4a or the p4a mutant showed that the antagonistic activity of p4a provided a clear fitness advantage in HeLa-wt cells. RNA was isolated at 8h post infection and relative IFN mRNA levels were quantified by RT-PCR. supernatant was collected 24h post infection and virus progeny was titrated by end-point dilution. the virus expressing p4a replicated better than the virus expressing mutant p4a. in PKRKO cells only a minor advantage was observed. we used a recombinant picornavirus, EMCV, to analyze the function of p4a in virus-infected cells. no increase in IFN mRNA levels was observed in Huh7 cells infected with MERS-CoV or MERS-CoVORF4. these data provide evidence for substantial redundancy with respect to antagonism of innate antiviral responses. p4a suppresses dsRNA-mediated and PKR-dependent translation inhibition. but infection of cells with a recombinant MERS-CoV deficient in p4a expression failed to trigger SG formation. this finding points to the expression of at least one other stress response antagonist. mouse hepatitis virus (MHV, a lineage A -CoV) triggers eIF2 phosphorylation and SG formation relatively late in infection. mouse hepatitis virus (MHV, a lineage A -CoV) triggers eIF2 phosphorylation. but the mechanism is unknown. p4a can be categorized in the group of previously identified viral dsRNA-binding antagonists of stress response and IFN-/ pathways. besides p4a, MERS-CoV expresses at least one other stress response antagonist. at least one antagonist can also suppress the arsenite-induced stress response pathway. the p4a-like accessory proteins of these other lineage C viruses all contain dsRNA-binding motifs. p4a of batCoV-HKU4 does not bind poly(I:C) and does not inhibit IFN-/ responses. p4a can potently antagonize innate antiviral responses in human cells. but p4a may not be critical for zoonotic transmission or for limited human-to-human spread, possibly because of redundancy in viral anti-stress response strategies. adapted as follows using two step en-passant in vivo recombineering reactions in E. coli. pBAC-MERSFL promoter replaced by a T7 RNA polymerase promoter. pStrep2-VFETQG-Zn-M16.1 infectious clone grew to similar titers. the optimized 3Cpro recognition site (VFETQG) was introduced by SDM using the following oligonucleotides: Fw; 5\u2019-GAAACTCAAGGCGCAACGACTATGGAGC-3\u2019 and Rv; 5\u2019-AAAGACCGCGGCCTTGCTCATTG-3\u2019.
