{"summary": "VZV is a neurotropic alphaherpesvirus that infects humans and results in chickenpox and herpes zoster. the SVV genome was cloned as a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) and BAC-derived SVV displayed similar replication kinetics as wild-type SVV. BAC genetic system combined with the rhesus macaque animal model can further our understanding of viral ORFs important for VZV pathogenesis and the development of second-generation vaccines. reactivation from latency can cause significant morbidity and occasionally mortality in older and immunocompromised individuals. previously, SVV BAC was shown to generate infectious virus with molecular properties and in vitro replication kinetics comparable to wild-type (WT) SVV. SVV BAC was also used to generate an ORF10 deletion virus, which demonstrated that SVV ORF10 is nonessential for replication in vitro[11]. SVV ORF22 is a putative tegument protein based on the function of herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) UL36 homolog. the missense mutation did not render SVV BAC derived virus noninfectious or hamper replication kinetics and plaque size in vitro[11]. peripheral blood mononuclear cells, PBMC) at various days post-infection were collected at necropsy (84\u201386 dpi) all infected RMs displayed hallmarks of SVV infection including the development of rash, which lasted between 7 and 10 days. a lesion area was biopsied at 10 dpi and viral loads were measured by quantitative real-time PCR. SVV DNA viral load in C) skin biopsy at 10 dpi measured by quantitative PCR using primers and probe specific for SVV ORF21 from SVV BAC infected RMs (open circle) whole blood was measured by quantitative PCR using primers and probe specific for SVV ORF21. concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN (involved in anti-viral activities and differentiation of T helper 1 subsets [21]), TNF (systemic inflammation [22]), IL-6 (pro- and anti-inflammatory responses [23]), IL-2 (pleiotropic activities in inflammation and immune regulation [27]) peaked at 7 dpi. concentrations in BAL fluid peaked at 7 dpi and returned to baseline by 10 dpi. concentrations of IL-1, IL-4, IL-5, IL-8, IL-17, GM-CSF and RANTES were below our limit of detection. we also measured the concentration of the above chemokines, cytokines, and growth factors in plasma. in BAL cells and PBMC we measured similar proliferation of both subsets of B cells. no statistical differences in RMs infected with either SVV BAC or WT SVV. we also measured SVV-specific IgG antibody endpoint titers in plasma. the frequency of proliferating CD4 and CD8 T cells was measured by flow cytometry based on the expression of Ki67 in central memory (CM) and effector memory (EM) subsets. the frequency of proliferating CD4 and CD8 T cells was measured by flow cytometry based on the expression of Ki67. the frequency of responding SVV-specific T cells was measured by intracellular cytokine staining following stimulation with either (A, B, E and F) SVV lysate or (C and D) overlapping peptide pool. the viral loads reported in Table 1 reflect SVV genome copy numbers in a portion of the ganglia. dRG-C, cervical dorsal root ganglia; DRG-T, thoracic dorsal root ganglia; DRG-L/S, lumbar/sacral dorsal root ganglia; ND, not detected. SVV BAC derived SVV viral genome was comprehensively analyzed by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) pes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) UL36 homolog did not render SVV BAC derived virus noninfectious or hamper replication kinetics and plaque size in vitro. a representative RM infected with SVV BAC at 7 dpi is shown in Figure 2A. a lesion area was biopsied at 10 dpi. by 10 dpi, we were able to detect viral DNA in all RMs except RMs 28553 and 28621 infected with WT SVV. whole blood was measured by quantitative PCR using primers and probe specific for SVV ORF21 from SVV BAC infected RMs (open circle) whole blood was measured by quantitative PCR using primers and probe specific for SVV ORF21 from SVV BAC infected RMs (open circle) and WT SVV infected RMs (closed circle) concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN (involved in anti-viral activities and differentiation of T helper 1 subsets [21]), TNF (systemic inflammation [22]), IL-6 (pro- and anti-inflammatory responses [23]), IL-2 (pro- and anti-inflammatory responses [23]) and IL-15 (proliferation of T cells and NK cells [25]) peaked at 7 dpi. concentrations of IL-1, IL-4, IL-5, IL-8, GM-CSF and RANTES were below our limit of detection. we also measured the concentration of the above chemokines, cytokines, and growth factors in plasma. however, we were only able to detect changes in the levels of IFN. we also measured SVV-specific IgG antibody endpoint titers in plasma using standard ELISA. kinetics of IgG production were comparable during SVV BAC and WT SVV infection of RMs. the frequency of proliferating CD4 and CD8 T cells was measured by flow cytometry based on the expression of Ki67 in central memory (CM) and effector memory (EM) subsets in (A) BAL and (B) PBMC, average SEM. SVV BAC (open circle) and WT SVV (closed circle) /TNF was measured by intracellular cytokine staining following stimulation with either (A, B, E and F) SVV lysate or (C and D) overlapping peptide pool. viral loads reported in Table 1 reflect SVV genome copy numbers in a portion of the ganglia. BACs were constructed for the VZV parental Oka virus and the vaccine Oka virus [35-38] all VZV ORFs have been deleted using BACs or cosmids and tested in cell culture. mutating the furin recognition site of VZV ORF31 (gB), an essential viral protein, did not affect VZV replication in vitro but attenuated viral replication in vivo. SVV BAC and SVV virus generated using the SVV BAC genetic system were found to be similar to WT SVV in vitro[11]. generation of a SVV ORF 63/70 mutant demonstrated impaired growth in Vero cells [44]. rhesus macaques animal model and the SVV BAC will provide a robust tool to examine viral ORFs important for pathogenesis. in vitro SVV BAC displays similar plaque size and replication kinetics in vero cell monolayers as compared to WT SVV. potentially the position of the amino acid change is a nonpolar side chain to a nonpolar side change allows for WT behavior. RMs infected with SVV showed a higher peak percentage of Ki67 positive cells. this difference could be due to the small sample size (n=4) and the outbred nature of rhesus macaques. infection with SVV BAC also resulted in a comparable upregulation of chemokines, cytokines, and growth factors. SVV BAC and WT SVV established latency within the sensory ganglia. SVV BAC is as pathogenic in vivo as WT SVV. future studies will use the SVV BAC genetic system to generate knockout viruses. WT SVV cell lysate was obtained by scraping infected primary rhesus fibroblasts at the height of CPE followed by centrifugation and sonication using 7 pulses of 70\u201380 Watts. rhesus macaques were SVV seronegative prior to infection measured by ELISA. oligonucleotides were 29\u201339 bp in length and tiled throughout the genome every 7\u20138 bases on both forward and reverse strands. DNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) DNA was extracted from heparinized whole blood (WB), BAL cells, and portions of frozen ganglia using ArchivePure DNA Cell/Tissue Kit (5 PRIME, Gaithersburg MD) AL supernatant samples were thawed and analyzed using Cytokine Monkey Magnetic 28-plex panel. ELISA plates were coated with SVV lysate overnight at 4\u00b0C. values below the limit of detection were designated as ND. MC surface stained with antibodies against CD4 (eBioscience, San Diego CA), CD8 (Beckman Coulter), CD28, and CD95 (BioLegend, San Diego CA) to delineate the naive (CD28+CD95), central memory (CD28+CD95+), and effector memory (CD28CD95+) T cell subsets. pSVV-BAC was generated from self-excisable pSVV-BAC. plasmid sequences from the virus genome were excisiond. rhesus macaques were housed at the Oregon National Primate Research Center. animals were euthanized at 84 to 86 days post-infection. oligonucleotides were 29\u201339 bp in length and tiled throughout the genome every 7\u20138 bases on both forward and reverse strands. the identified mismatches were directly sequenced from PCR products obtained from amplifying the surrounding sequence. the primers employed for Figure 1 include: (B) primer 1, 5\u2032-CCATATGTACCAACGGGAACA-3\u2032 and primer 2, 5\u2032-AAGCATGCATTGGA-3\u2032; (C) primer 1, 5\u2032-GCCTGGAGCCCAGATATTCGA-3\u2032 and primer 2, 5\u2032-ACGGTGGATGCATCA-3\u2032. ELISA plates were coated with SVV lysate overnight at 4\u00b0C. they were blocked with 5% milk in wash buffer (0.05% Tween in PBS) for 1 h at room-temperature. horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rhesus IgG (Nordic Immunology, Netherlands) was added for 1 h. samples were fixed, permeabilized and dual-stained using antibodies against IFN (eBioscience) and TNF (eBioscience) the authors declared that they have no competing interests.
