{"summary": "a cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the prevalence of GI parasites of dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius) and fat-tailed sheep (dhumba), and the prevalence of hemoparasites in camel from dhaka, Bangladesh. a total of 87 fecal samples (32 dhumba and 55 camel) and 55 camel blood samples were collected during September\u2013October 2015. 59.4% dhumba (n = 19; 95% CI: 41\u201376) were positive for GI parasite, including Trichostrongylus spp. (n = 10; 31.3%; 95% CI: 16.1\u201350), Strongyloides spp. (n = 9; 28%; 95% CI: 13.8\u201346.8) only one established camel farm is found in Bangladesh, which excels in camel farming as well as dhumba farming. parasites affect production by reducing fertility and work capacity, decreasing food intake, and lowering weight gain and milk production. public health is in danger because of zoonotic parasites. the study protocol was reviewed and approved by the animal Ethical Experimentation Committee (AEEC) of Chittagong Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (CVASU), Bangladesh (CVASU/Dir-(R&E)-AEEC/2015/927) and the University of California, Davis (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee #16048) eggs of particular genera and adult parasites were identified based on morphological characters (shape and shell structure) and size. information was collected on the feeding system and source of water of the animals to trace back the source of parasites. study protocol was reviewed and approved by the animal Ethical Experimentation Committee (AEEC) of Chittagong Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (CVASU), Bangladesh (CVASU/Dir-(R&E)-AEEC/2015/927) sample collection and laboratory techniques Samples were collected opportunistically as part of a larger study through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Emerging Pandemic Threats PREDICT project during September\u2013October 2015. information was collected on the feeding system and source of water of the animals to trace back the source of parasites. egg of (a) Trichuris spp., (b) Trichostrongylus spp., (c) Strongyloides spp., (c) Schistosoma spp., (f) Moniezia spp., and (g) B. coli found from camel samples, Dhaka, Bangladesh 2015. three nematodes (Trichuris spp., Trichostrongylus spp., and Strongyloides spp.), two cestodes (Paragonimus spp. and Schistosoma spp.), two cestodes (Balantidium), and two hemoparasites (Anaplasma spp. and Babesia spp.) in camel. positive n (%) 95% CI Nematode Trichuris spp. 16 (29.1) 17.6\u201342.9 4 (12.5) 3.5\u201328.9 Trichostrongylus spp. 7 (12.7) 5.3\u201324.5 10 (31.3) 16.1\u201350.0 Strongyloides spp. 5 (9.1) 3.0\u201320.0 9 (28.1) 13.8\u201346.8 Trematode Paragonimus spp. 1 (1.8) animals from market, female animals, adults, and animal with poor body condition were found to be more parasitized (Table 2). animals from market, female animals, adults, and animal with poor body condition were found to be more parasitized (Table 2). no previous study reported the prevalence of GI parasite in fat-tailed sheep and hemoparasites in camel in camel till date. the overall prevalence of GI parasite was 62% in camel, similar to the findings of [12] but previous studies reported both higher [13,14] and lower [15] percentage of GI parasite in camel than our study. average helminth eggs in Bactrian camel were found to be 0\u2013191 eggs/gm and 51.96 13.82 by [15], much lower than our findings. previous studies from Bangladesh on domestic sheep (Ovis aries) reported prevalence of GI parasite. uris ovis (3.67%\u201358.29%) [22], Trichostrongylus spp. (34.55%) [22], and Strongyloides papillosus (4%) [29]. hot and humid condition is favorable for development and survival of parasites. drinking water and animal feeds become contaminated and lead to higher prevalence of parasitic diseases in the rainy season. dhumba in the study implies unhygienic condition of farm and market. dhumba from the market were more infected than that of farm. higher prevalence of GI parasites was found in female fat-tailed sheep and camel. we studied the determinants associated with a high prevalence of diverse GI parasites. this information will convey an important message to farmers and practitioners for parasite control strategies. regular use of anthelmintic and hygienic management should be implemented in farms."}
