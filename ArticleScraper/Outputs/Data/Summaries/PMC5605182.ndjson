skin preparation with P-I (10%; Betadine Solution, Purdue) alternating with 70% IPA; (4) P-I alternating with 0.9% NaCl saline that had been heated in a warm water bath to 37 \u00b0C, removed only during the application process; and promptly returned to the heating bath. core and surface temperatures were collected from minutes 8 to 38, with no further manipulation. mice were shaved to remove hair and expose 22-cm area of skin to laparotomy. mice were kept on 100% oxygen at 0.6 L/min until movement was observed. mice were transferred to a prewarmed cage for additional recovery. the variables TIME 1 and TIME 2 were coded such that the intercept was located at minute 7, the last time point prior to onset of treatment. to investigate the effect of body weight of mice on the trajectory of temperature changes, the following approach was used such that the Level-1 model was defined as Y i t = 0 i + 1 i T I M E 1 i t + 2 i T I M E 2 i t + 3 i T I M E 2 i t graphic figures were designed to show mean temperatures for each treatment group every 4 min. error bars on the graphs identify the pointwise 95% confidence intervals for the mean temperature at each time point. for posttreatment trajectories, we used orthogonal polynomials,9 which contained linear, quadratic, and cubic functions of TIME 2 in the Level-1 model. the variables TIME 1 and TIME 2 were coded so that the intercept was located at minute 7. to investigate the effect of body weight of mice on the trajectory of temperature changes, the following approach was used. graphic figures were designed to show mean temperatures for each treatment group every 4 min. error bars on the graphs identify pointwise 95% confidence intervals for the mean temperature at each time point, based on the sampling distribution of sample mean. dine and isopropyl alcohol (P-I/IPA) or povidone\u2013iodine and saline (P-I/saline) were significantly cooler than the control group. at minutes 12, all treatment groups except isopropyl alcohol (IPA) were significantly cooler than the control value. at minutes 20, 24, 28, 32, and 36, temperatures in all treatment groups except IPA were significantly lower than controls. the control group baseline showed a drop of 1.29 \u00b0C prior to other experimental groups receiving their respective scrub treatments. the average control core temperature was 34.50 0.48 \u00b0C, with a temperature drop over the experimental time course of 2.025 \u00b0C. the linear rate-of-change showed a decline, without the dramatic drop that occurred in groups given scrub treatments. the average IPA group core temperature was 33.9 0.84 \u00b0C. the quadratic term ( = 10.608, P 0.001) was positive. the IPA group showed a significantly faster recovery to the baseline temperature than the control group. the P-I/saline group experienced the smallest drop in core temperatures at the time of application (0.73 \u00b0C) and had a further 0.90 \u00b0C drop during the first 4 min after application. the average core temperature was 32.7 1.32 \u00b0C, and the lowest average temperature was 31.4 \u00b0C. mice in the IPA group took longer ( = \u20130.872, P = 0.015) to recover from the initial drop of temperature after treatment application than the control group. heavier mice in the IPA group took longer ( = \u20130.872, P = 0.015) to recover from the initial drop of temperature. the surface temperature change from start to end in the P-I group was 0.04 \u00b0C. the average surface temperature was 28.2 1.86 \u00b0C. the P-I/IPA group experienced a drop in surface temperatures at the time of application (5.90 \u00b0C);
