{"summary": "enterovirus 71 (EV71) is a positive-stranded RNA virus belonging to the enterovirus genus of the Picornaviridae family. most of the EV71 infections resolve spontaneously; however, EV71 infection occasionally causes neurological complications that can lead to cardiopulmonary failure and death. there are no vaccines or antiviral drugs available to use against EV71 infection in the clinic. the activity of lycorine against EV71 replication was investigated in vitro and in mice models infected with EV71 strain. a clinically isolated strain FY0805 (GenBank accession no. HQ882182) and the mouse-adapted EV71 strain MP10 (GenBank accession no. HQ712020) were cultured in RD cells. RD cells were plated in 96-well plates and grown overnight to 90% confluence at 37\u00b0C. the cells were then treated with lycorine for 72 hours at 37\u00b0C. the cells were then infected with 105 TCID50 of FY0805. primary antibodies were visualised with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Sigma) using a chemiluminescent detection system (Santa Cruz) the bands were quantified by densitometry using Quantity One software. intensity of bands for six viral proteins in the saline-treated group were used as standards and defined as 100. each ten-day-old mouse was intraperitoneally (i.p.) inoculated with 1 107 TCID50 of MP10. each mouse at eleven-day-old was inoculated with 1 107 TCID50 of MP10. at 12 hours post infection, infected mice were intraperitoneally injected with different concentrations of lycorine in saline daily twice for 7 days. the sections were developed with 3-3'diaminobenzidine (DAB) and observed under a light microscope (Olympus) the statistical significance of differences in mean values was assessed by Duncan's multiple-range test following a one-way analysis of variance. fected cells were treated with lycorine in a set of concentrations in saline as 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 g/ml. the infected RD cells were harvested at eight-hour intervals post infection. the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was defined as the concentration of lycorine that caused a 50% CPE reduction compared to that of the saline-treated control. the supernatants were subjected to viral RNA and protein analysis. the infected RD cells treated with saline were used as control. the cDNA was then reverse transcribed using random hexamers. a fragment corresponding to nucleotides 2462-2635 of FY0805 was adjusted to a concentration gradient. the viral cDNA obtained above was assayed by PCR amplification with the same primers. results were normalised to GAPDH. six mice were subjected to pathologic examination for each experimental group. the tissues were bisected, embedded in paraffin, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin stain (H&E) ten sections of muscle were observed per animal in a blinded manner. the CC50 of lycorine (48.5 g/ml, Figure 2) was approximately 100-fold higher than the IC50 of it against EV71 infection. the viral copy number was detected by qRT-PCR in the RD cells treated with lycorine at a dose of 1 g/ml. the band densities of these proteins at 1.0 hour of lycorine-treatment were set as 100. the inhibition of lycorine on synthesis of C terminal proteins was more remarkable than that of N terminal proteins. lycorine inhibited the elongation of EV71 polyprotein during translation. lycorine treatment reduced the mortality of EV71-infected mice. survival rates of EV71-infected mice treated with placebo, ribavirin and lycorine were recorded to14 dpi (n = 40) treatment with lycorine delayed the paralysis appearance to 1 day later compared with that of the placebo. virus replication in the muscle of lycorine-treated mice was inhibited by 10-100 folds at different time points compared to that of the saline control. serious muscle necrotic appeared at 3 dpi and lead to paralysis of mice. the lycorine-treatment (0.4 mg/kg) obviously reduced the muscle damage caused by EV71 infection. the virus distribution was detected by immunohistological staining. the red arrows indicated virions in tissues, the green arrows for moderate inflammation and the blue for necrotising myositis. lycorine treatment protected mice from apparent symptoms post non-lethal dose EV71 challenge. lycorine inhibited EV71 infection in RD cells in a dose-dependent manner. lycorine inhibited EV71 infection in RD cells in a dose-dependent manner. the data are expressed as mean values of three independent experiments SD, *: p 0.05. the RD cells were seeded into the 96-well plate and cultured continuously for 3 days. the CC50 was calculated by the CPE of RD cells. the cells were treated with or without lycorine (1 g/ml) at 6 hours post infection. lycorine treatment reduced the mortality of EV71-infected mice. placebo, ribavirin and lycorine (three different doses) were recorded to14 dpi. the clinical scores of infected mice treated with placebo or lycorine were systematically evaluated. treatment with lycorine delayed the paralysis appearance to 1 day later compared with that of the placebo. infected mice were treated with placebo or lycorine at a dose of 0.4 mg/kg. the muscle tissues were sampled at 1 dpi, 3 dpi, 5 dpi and 9 dpi respectively. the virus distribution was detected by immunohistological staining. the virus replication in muscle tissues of lycorine-treated mice was significantly inhibited by more than 100-fold compared to the saline control. lycorine treatment protected the infected-mice from symptoms of paralysis except occasionally skin fur. lycorine showed inhibitory activity against EV71 replication in RD cells. lycorine treatment significantly enhanced survival rate of EV71-infected mice. there have been debates on which step of protein synthesis is blocked by lycorine. lycorine is suspected to be the source of amaryllidaceae poisoning in humans and animals. lycorine could inhibit the replication of EV71 at very low concentration. the IC50 for inhibiting EV71 infection was approximately 100-fold lower than the CC50 on RD cell. treatment with several drug candidates, including ribavirin, bovine lactoferrin, siRNA and type I interferon, increased survival rates of infected mice to 18%-100% [14-17] however, because the infection doses of virus and strains were different in these experiments, it is difficult to compare the activity of these drugs. authors declare that they have no competing interests.
