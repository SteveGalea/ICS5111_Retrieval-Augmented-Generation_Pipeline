{"summary": "Objective Microsimulation was used to assess the financial impact on hospitals of a surge in influenza admissions in advance of the H1N1 pandemic in the fall of 2009. the goal was to estimate net income and losses (nationally, and by hospital type) of a response of filling unused hospital bed capacity proportionately and postponing elective admissions. population counts by region were based on the July 2008 census estimates. baseline hospital utilization was taken from the 2007 Nationwide Inpatient Sample database. the NIS includes more than 8 million hospital discharges from over 1,000 hospitals in 40 states. hospital staff absenteeism was an issue in planning for the H1N1 pandemic. timely information on this subject was sparse and mostly did not apply to a situation where health care workers could not be vaccinated. flu cases treated at each hospital were defined by specific ICD-9-CM codes. combined assumptions for the net income or profit percentage over cost were Medicare, 0 percent; private insurance, 24 percent; Medicaid, 19 percent; self-pay and charity, 13 percent. the assumptions were made independently of the epidemiologic parameters for the demand surge. postponing elective admissions is a potentially controversial issue within a hospital. larger hospitals during a pandemic were assumed to be capable of reaching an unoccupied capacity rate of 0 percent, whereas smaller hospitals could reach an unoccupied capacity rate of 15 percent. larger hospitals tend to run at higher occupancy rates than smaller hospitals. the total additional demand for bed days of care in the fourth quarter of the year was Nf*Lf. the total capacity available in the area was as follows: where h [...] was the sum over all h in the region. a hospital could eventually reach its lower limit constraint on unused capacity, Zh. the president's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology forecasted an attack rate net of vaccine effectiveness of between 15 and 25 percent for the fall of 2009. the net hospitalization demand was the product of the attack rate and hospital admission rate for affected patients. the net hospitalization demand was the product of the attack rate and hospital admission rate for affected patients. hospital bed capacity, full-time equivalent (FTE) employee staffing, and other variables were taken from the annual survey of hospitals for 2007 to correspond with the 2007 NIS. these hospital types or \u201cpeer groups\u201d are relevant due to the sampling design in the NIS. the rate of hospital net income for privately insured patients (24 percent over cost) was taken from national data. the combined assumptions for the net income or profit percentage over cost were Medicare, 0 percent; private insurance, 24 percent; Medicaid, 19 percent; and self-pay and charity, 13 percent. Detailed simulation methods and Specific Assumptions were made independently of the epidemiologic parameters for the demand surge. the assumptions were as follows: the surge of demand arrived at a steady rate during the fourth calendar quarter of 2009, rather than gradually building up, peaking, and coming down gradually over a longer period. h = 90*BhDh; Zh, lowest rate to which unused capacity can be pushed for h; Nf, additional flu patients seeking admission in the region, with average LOS of Lf. a hospital could eventually reach its lower limit constraint on unused capacity, Zh, with no remaining postponable elective admissions. for each hospital the number of flu cases was known, the cost of such cases was known in 2007 dollars, and the payer mix for elective and for flu patients at the hospital was known. for each hospital the net income or loss from additional flu patients, and the losses from postponed elective patients could be calculated. for-profit, under 300 beds 984 3,230 4.74 89 47.9 2.
