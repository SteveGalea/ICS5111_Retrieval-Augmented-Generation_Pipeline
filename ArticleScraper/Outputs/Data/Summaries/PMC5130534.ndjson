{"summary": "synthetic proteasome inhibitor MG132 (carboxybenzoxy-Leu-leu-leucinal), chemical chaperone 4-PBA, IRE1 chemical inhibitor 48C (8-formyl-7-hydroxy-4-methylcoumarin) and propidium iodide (PI) were purchased from Sigma Chemical (St. Louis, MO) antibodies for Western blotting were obtained as following: total IRE1, total PERK, total eukaryotic translational initiation factor for 4-PBA studies, cells were either incubated with 4-PBA (5 mM) for 1 h before treatment with MG132 (10 M) for 24 h or transfected with SP-C plasmids for 8 h prior to treatment with 4-PBA for 48 h. wild-type and wild-type plasmids were amplified using Plasmid Plus Maxi Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) protein samples were run on 7.5\u201312% gradient polyacrylamide gels. membranes were incubated in 5% nonfat dry milk buffer in 1 h at room temperature and incubated with primary antibodies at 4\u00b0C overnight then with secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Detection of the proteins was performed using Supersignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (GE Healthcare Biosciences, Pittsburgh, PA). buffered saline containing 5 g/ml PI and 24-well culture vessels were centrifuged to retain the detached cells during fixation with ethanol. apoptotic cells were scored as cells with discrete nuclear fragments containing condensed chromatin. in situ end labeling of fragmented DNA was examined for equating of apoptosis. all other reagents were purchased from Sigma Chemical or Bio-Rad (Melville, NY) the human lung adenocarcinoma cell line was grown in 6- or 24-well chambers in Ham's F-12 medium (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) all cells were grown in 6-well or 24-well chambers and analyzed with inhibitors when they reached 70\u201380% confluency. A549 cells grown to 70\u201380% confluence were transfected with the indicated plasmid construct using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) the oligonucleotides against each target sensor were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. ide-to-Lipofectamine ratio was optimized by using FITC-labeled nucleotides (31) and transfection efficiencies were determined by Western blotting. human A549 cells were transfected with antisense oligonucleotides against UPR sensors for 24 h then treated with MG132 for 24 h. after treatment with inhibitor, A549 cells were monitored for apoptosis by nuclear fragmentation assay using PI as 157 antibodies for Western blotting were obtained as following. total IRE1, total PERK, total eukaryotic translational initiation factor 2 (eIF2), cleaved caspase-3, activating transcription factor-4 (ATF4), ADAM17/TACE, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP), -actin (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA); all other reagents were purchased from Sigma Chemical wild-type and wild-type plasmids were amplified using pIRES-dsRED plasmid. wild-type and wild-type plasmids were transfected with the indicated plasmid construct. antisense oligonucleotides against each human UPR sensor (siATF6, siIRE1, PERK) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. oligonucleotides were grown in six-well chambers until reaching 60\u201370% confluency then were transfected with antisense oligonucleotides against each target sensor. the oligonucleotide-to-Lipofectamine ratio was optimized by using FITC apoptotic fragmented nuclei of AECs in the nuclear fragment assay (16) caspase-3 activation, another marker of the apoptosis stage, was also measured by Western blot using antibodies specific for the active form of caspase-3. previous studies also demonstrated that 4-PBA, a well-known chemical chaperone, could rescue the mutant SP-C protein from trafficking and reduce ER stress in multiple cell types. blocking of UPR pathways in AECs by 4-PBA can inhibit ER stress-induced activation of the IRE1 pathway. human alveolar A549 cells either incubated with MG132 (10 M, A and C) for 24 h or were transfected with wild-type SP-C or G100S SP-C mutation plasmids (B and D) for 48 h in the presence or absence of 4-PBA (5 mM) MG132 (Fig. 2B) or SP-C BRICHOS domain mutation (Fig. 2C) substantially upregulated the phosphorylation of eIF2 protein. inhibition of the UPR pathways by chemical chaperone can prevent the PERK/eIF2 but not ATF4/CHOP activation. MG132 increased the level of CHOP protein in a549 cells compared with wild-type SP-C. chemical chaperone 4-PBA could not block the activation of either ATF4 or CHOP protein in a549 cells. cathepsin D, an aspartyl protease that enzymatically cleaves angiotensinogen to produce ANGII, is required for AEC apoptosis (14, 33) recent studies have shown either fibrogenic agent bleomycin (13) or ER stress inducer MG132 upregulated both the immunoreactive protein and enzymatic activity of cathepsin D. A549 cells were transfected with plasmids containing W.T. SP-C or SP-C BRICHOS domain mutant (G100S) for 48 h in the presence or absence of 4-PBA (5 mM) Whole cell lysates were harvested for detection of cathepsin D protein, active form (14). anti-actin antibody was used as loading control. human A549 cells were exposed to MG132 (10 M) for 24 h (A) or transfected with plasmids containing wild-type SP-C or SP-C BRICHOS domain mutant G100S. whole cell lysates were harvested for detection of ADAM17/TACE and -actin antibodies. A549 cells were challenged with MG132 (10 M, A and C) for 24 h or were transiently transfected with plasmids containing wild-type SP-C or SP-C BRICHOS domain mutant G100S (B and E) for 48 h. cells were harvested for Western blot detection of cleaved (active form of caspase-3 (A and B) or measured of fragmented nuclei (C\u2013E) knockdown of aTF6 or IRE1 pathway using antisense oligonucleotides appeared to have more effect on preventing ER stress-induced cathepsin D upregulation. a549 cells were challenged with either siRNAs against UPR target sensors (siATF6, siIRE1, siPERK) or scramble siRNAs (siCTL) whole cell lysates harvested for detection of ACE-2 protein (inactive and active forms) by Western blotting. anti-actin antibody used as loading control. 48C is a selective blocker of IRE1 that can inactivate mRNA degradation in MEF and HEK-293T cells. also, atkins and colleagues have identified GSK2656157 as a potent blocker of PERK. ER stress in response to either MG132 or SP-C mutation activates all three UPR arms. ACE-2 downregulation control the ratio of the proapoptotic ANGII and the antiapoptotic ANG1-7. ANGII inhibits ANGII-induced JNK phosphorylation and apoptosis through mas-mediated upregulation of MAP kinase phosphatase-2 (MKP-2), which inhibits ANGII-induced JNK phosphorylation and apoptosis. bleomycin-induced apoptosis of AECs requires conversion of AGT to ANGII. ER stress inducer MG132 upregulated cathepsin D activation in AECs. resulting reduction of cathepsin D would reduce apoptosis by reducing the ANGII/ANG1-7 ratio. TAPI2, an ADAM17/TACE inhibitor, could prevent MG132- or clastocystin-induced cathepsin D activation of A549 cells. either MG132 or G100S SP-C mutation upregulated the activation of ADAM17/TACE protein, and chemical chaperone 4-PBA could prevent the G100S-induced TACE activation of alveolar epithelial A549 cells. antiapoptotic ANG1-7 could inhibit JNK phosphorylation in AECs challenged with either apoptotic agent bleomycin or ANGII. inhibition of ANG1-7 receptor mas by A779 or antisense nucleotides against mas mRNA showed an increase in phosphorylated JNK and cleaved caspase-3. ANGII-induced apoptosis of AECs is mediated by ANG ER stress-induced apoptosis of human AECs is mediated by UPR pathways that modulate the autocrine ANGII/ANG1-7 system of these cells. understanding mechanisms by which ER stress and UPR regulate the angiotensin system will support understanding of the apoptosis of AECs."}
