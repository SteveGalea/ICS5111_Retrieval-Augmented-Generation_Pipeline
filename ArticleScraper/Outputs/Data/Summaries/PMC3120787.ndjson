{"summary": "HSV-1 lytic infection triggers the expression of important multi-functional transcription factor Egr1. the mechanisms of induction are mediated, at least in part, by signaling pathways such as NFB and CREB. herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) is a common pathogen with worldwide seroprevalence rates ranging from 50% to 90%. it is a neurotropic virus that is in the subfamily of alpha herpesvirinae. the virus infects sensory neurons proximal to the site of primary infection. gene expression of HSV-1 is tightly regulated in a cascade fashion. the three temporal classes of genes are designated immediate-early (), early () and late () genes. there are five genes, designated ICP0, ICP4, ICP22, ICP27, and ICP47. our previous transient cotransfection studies with promoter plasmids and Egr-1 expression vector showed that Egr-1 regulated HSV-1 ICP22 and ICP4 promoter activity [17]. in the present study, we demonstrate for the first time that Egr-1 protein is induced rapidly in cells such as SIRC and VERO upon infection. immunofluoroscence Approximately 20,000 cells were placed in a multi-chamber slide (Cat# 354104 BD Falcon) with respective media one day before infection. cells were pretreated for 3 hours with inhibitors Bay 11-7082 (Calbiochem#196871) and NBD binding peptide (Calbiochem Cat#: 480025) after infection cells were rinsed once with 2 ml PBS for 5 min. reverse transcription/PCR reaction was carried out at 45\u00b0C for 20 min. 25 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 55\u00b0C for 30 s, and 68\u00b0C for 30 s. cell monolayers were treated with 1% formaldehyde solution for 10 min. fter 2 days, the cells were infected with virus (MOI = 1) for 1 hour. the cells were then incubated in fresh medium for 24 hours. immunofluorescence was carried out using anti-Egr-1 antibody. ence Approximately 20,000 cells were placed in a multi-chamber slide (Cat# 354104 BD Falcon) with respective media one day before infection. cells were pretreated for 3 hours with inhibitors Bay 11-7082 (Calbiochem#196871) and NBD binding peptide (Calbiochem Cat#: 480025) after infection cells were rinsed once with 2 ml PBS for 5 min and fixed with 100% methanol at -20\u00b0C. the reverse transcription/PCR reaction was carried out at 45\u00b0C for 20 min followed by 25 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 55\u00b0C for 30 s, and 68\u00b0C for 30 s. the cells were cotransfected with phMGFP (Promega Cat #E6421) and one of the vectors (pCMV-CREB133 or pCMV-KCREB) using lipofectamine. the cells were infected with virus (MOI = 1) for 1 hour. the cells were then incubated in fresh medium for 24 hours. immunofluorescence staining was performed on infected cells. results indicated that Egr1 protein was induced by HSV-1 infection. western blot analysis shows expression of Egr-1 protein (83 Kda) in infected VERO cells 24 hours post treatment. infection at higher moi (Lane 3) led to cell death therefore no significant increase of Egr-1 production was observed. the results indicated that viral replication was not required for Egr-1 mRNA expression. total mRNA was isolated at 1, 2,3,12, and 24 hours post treatment. NF\u043aB and pCREB were recruited to the promoter upon infection. PCR was performed using primers for the Egr-1 promoter. VERO cells were transfected with phMGFP alone and in combination with CREB dominant negative vectors pCREB133. cells infected with control vector show induction of Egr-1 protein (red) whereas cells infected with dominant negative mutants, CREB133(c) or KCREB (d) do not show the induction of the Egr-1 protein. NF\u043aB inhibition reduced Egr-1 expression by infection. a time-course study revealed that detectable levels of Egr-1 protein were present at 24 hours post infection. similar levels were detected at 48 and 72 hours post infection. human corneal cell line HCE-2 was sufficient to produce Egr-1 upon HSV-1 infection. however, Egr-1 was not inducible in HEK293 cells. uninfected HEK 293 cells express Egr1 (lane 1), and no induction was seen upon infection with HSV-1 MOI 10 (lane 2). infection controls showed no EGFP signal or Egr-1, indicating specificity of the antibody. mRNA was isolated at 1, 2,3,12, and 24 hours post treatment and RT-PCR was performed. NF\u043aB and pCREB were recruited to the promoter upon infection. this type of recruitment was not seen in HEK293 cells, which exhibited no Egr1 induction upon infection. dominant-negative CREB decreased the Egr-1 induction observed upon infection Immunofluorescent analyses were performed to investigate if CREB participated in Egr1 induction. the number of green fluorescent cells observed was similar after 2 days, indicating that transfection efficiency was equivalent. NBD binding peptide is a cell-permeable fusion peptide that inhibits cytokine-induced NF-B activation and NF-B-dependent gene expression. NF\u043aB inhibitors abolished the induction of Egr-1 upon infection. NF\u043aB and CREB play roles in Egr1 expression induced by HSV-1. studies have reported the presence of NF\u043aB regulatory sequence [24] and CRE [25] in the human Egr-1 promoter. recombinant virus over-expressing Egr-1 and stable cell lines containing siRNA repressing Egr-1 are being constructed to further investigate the roles of Egr-1 during HSV-1 lytic infections. it is not known which viral proteins are required for Egr-1 induction. the Egr1 induced by HSV-1 in corneal cells could have implications in viral pathogenesis, inflammation, and disease progression. authors declare that they have no competing interests. all authors read and approved the final manuscript. the publication was made possible by NIH Grant R15EY020803 to SVH."}
