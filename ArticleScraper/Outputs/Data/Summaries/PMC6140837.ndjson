{"summary": "attention has been given to nutritional intervention strategies to improve the health, well-being and performance of pigs. recently, one strategy involved increasing dietary soybean meal (SBM) and thus reducing crystalline AA use. however, the mode of action by which these beneficial SBM effects may occur are poorly defined and may involve nutrient digestibility (Schweer et al., 2017) limited studies have determined the BEL of AA due to a pathogen or vaccine challenge in pigs or other livestock species. in nursery and growing pigs, Salmonella Typhimurium increased BEL of several AA. in contrast, use of a mild coccidial vaccine in broilers reduced BEL of several AA. pigs were individually penned (1.4 1.5 m) with each disease status having a separate room (Control or PRRSV) to prevent viral cross-infection. the PRRSV room (n = 10 pigs/rep) received a sham saline inoculation. soybean meal inclusion was limited to 10% in the LSBM diet and supplemented with l-LysHCl. diets were formulated to be isocaloric (ME basis) and contain similar SID Lys concentrations. all diets contained 0.40% chromic oxide as an indigestible marker. 1,125 IU vitamin A, 700 IU vitamin D3, 50 IU vitamin E, 30-mg vitamin K, 0.05-mg vitamin B12, 11-mg riboflavin, 56-mg niacin, and 27-mg pantothenic acid. pigs were restrictively fed to ensure the entire meal was eaten during the collection periods. test was performed using commercial reagents (VetMAX NA and EU PRRSV real-time RT-PCR, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) a commercial ELISA kit was used to detect anti-PRRSV antibody per manufacturer\u2019s instruction. digesta and feces were collected at 2 different periods. feed, fecal, and digesta samples were dried in a mechanical convection oven at 100 \u00b0C. all samples were analyzed for DM (method 930.15; AOAC, 2007), chromic oxide as described by Fenton and Fenton (1979), chromic oxide as described by Fenton and Fenton. standardized ileal digestibility values for each AA were calculated by correcting the AID for BEL using the equation. each pig could not serve as its own control for SID determination. animal work was approved by the Iowa State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC# 1-16-8156-S) and adhered to the ethical and humane use of animals for research. pigs were semi-sedated with 1.1 mg/kg BW of a tiletamine-zolazepam\u2013ketamine\u2013xylazine (fort Dodge Animal Health, Fort Dodge, IA) combination. Diets and Feeding Dietary treatments were arranged in a 2 2 + 2 factorial with 2 SBM dietary inclusion (10% vs. 29.7%) by PRRSV challenge status (with or without) as factorial variables plus a N-free (NF) diet with or without PRRSV as an added variable. NF diet was fed at 0 to 8 and 12 to 19 dpi (4- to 5-d diet adaptation followed by a 4-d collection) a 50/50 blend of HSBM and LSBM diets (Table 1) was fed after collection on 8 to 11 dpi. pigs were restrictively fed to ensure the entire meal was eaten during the collection periods. for 5 d before collections, pigs were fed 2.5 times the estimated energy requirement for maintenance. blood samples were collected from all pigs at dpi 0, 7, 14 and 21 via jugular venipuncture in vacutainer serum tubes. Ileal digesta was collected from 0800 to 1600 h on dpi 7 to 6 and dpi 18 to 19. all fecal samples were stored at 20 \u00b0C until further analysis. a subsample of ileal digesta was collected, stored at 20 \u00b0C. Amino acid composition of diet and digesta samples was determined by the Agricultural Experiment Station Chemical Laboratories at the University of Missouri\u2013Columbia (Columbia, MO) by cation-exchange HPLC (L8900 Amino Acid Analyzer, Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) the AID (%) and ATTD (%) of each dietary component were calculated using the following equations. control and PRRSV pigs fed NF diets were analyzed separately from the factorial design. the data were analyzed as a completely randomized design using the same procedure of SAS version 9.4. BM to 32% inclusion can improve growth performance during a natural inflammatory-pathogen challenge in the finishing period of pigs. however, it remains unclear if improved performance and viral clearance is a result of increased digestibility of CP and AA.
