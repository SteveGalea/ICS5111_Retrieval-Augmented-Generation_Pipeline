{"summary": "monocytes, which produce pro-inflammatory mediators, are readily recruited to the central nervous system (CNS) in neurodegenerative diseases. inflammatory changes develop with age and are a feature of most neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer\u2019s disease. circulating monocytes express specific cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) that are altered with age. circulating monocytes readily infiltrate the brain in murine models of AD [8], [9] and may be involved in amyloid- (A) clearance [10], suggesting that circulating monocytes may be a valuable model system in assessing the role of microglial cells in pathogenesis of neurodegenerative conditions. LR5, TLR6, TLR8, and TLR9 mRNA are most highly expressed [13]. polymorphism in the tlr2 and tlr4 gene linked with the disease. a group of otherwise healthy adults who we classify as low performers (LP) because their memory performance is discrepant with their estimated IQ. we show that treatment of MDMs with LPS promoted pro-inflammatory cytokine production in HP and LP groups. the effect was exacerbated in MDMs prepared from the LP group. participants were defined as LP if they scored more than 0.75 standard deviations below their NART-estimated IQ on the WMS. memory performance was less than 0.75 z-score below their estimated premorbid IQ. participants received reimbursement of travel expenses to the maximum value of \u20ac20. CD14+ cells, obtained from PBMCs following MACS sorting, were seeded (6105 cells/ml) on 24-well plates and cultured in RPMI supplemented with FBS (10%), antibiotics and human granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (10 ng/ml; R&D Systems, UK) at the end of this period, cells were assessed again by flow cytometry. cytometry of CD11b+, TLR2+ and TLR4+ cells in PBMCs and MDMs was performed on a DAKO Cytomation cytometer (DAKO Cytomation, UK) with Summit v4.3 software. gating set on appropriate type matched IgG1 isotype controls and fluorescence-minus one controls prepared from LP and LP groups. non-specific staining was further minimised by incubating cells from HP qman\u00ae Gene Expression Assay no. Hs00355885_m1, Hs00610101_m1 and Hs00152937_m1 respectively. cDNA was mixed with qPCRTM Mastermix Plus (Applied Biosystems, USA) and the respective gene assay in a 25 l volume (10 l of diluted cDNA, 12.5 l Taqman\u00ae Universal PCR Mastermix, 1.25 l target primer and 1.25 l GAPDH) the plate was read immediately using a Mesoscale Sector Imager plate reader. a pro-inflammatory cytokine concentration was added to the plate. the plate was read immediately using a Mesoscale Sector Imager. HP LP N 35 12 Age (years; mean SD) 71.94.7 71.14.8 Sex (F/M) 26/9 9/3 MMSE 27.42.8 26.92.6 Premorbid IQ 1.130.37 1.200.29 Delayed verbal memory was determined by the Logical Memory subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scale. participants received reimbursement of travel expenses to the maximum value of \u20ac20. the mean percentage monocytes in PBMCs from HP and LP groups were 20.51.0 and 18.481.7. in this study, CD14+ cells, obtained from PBMCs following MACS sorting, were seeded (6105 cells/ml) on 24-well plates and cultured in RPMI supplemented with FBS (10%), antibiotics and human granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (10 ng/ml; R&D Systems, UK) CD14+ monocytes, isolated from PBMCs using positive selection with MACS microbeads, were differentiated to MDMs over 7 days. viable MDMs gated via forward and side scatter. non-specific staining was further minimised by incubating cells from HP and LP groups in purified human IgG. equal amounts of cDNA were used for RT-PCR amplification. real-time PCR primers were delivered as \u201cTaqman\u00ae Gene Expression Assays\u201d. cDNA was mixed with qPCRTM Mastermix Plus (Applied Biosystems, USA) plates were blocked in Diluent 2 for 30 min at room temperature. Detection antibody solution was added for 2 h at room temperature. plate was read immediately using a Mesoscale Sector Imager plate reader. CD11b expression is upregulated by many inflammatory mediators including cytokines. no difference in MDM CD14 mRNA was observed between groups. differentiation of monocytes to macrophages was similar in LP and HP individuals. expression on MDMs from the LP group was significantly greater than from the HP group. MFI values for the HP and LP groups were 37.1 and 28.3 respectively. differentiated MDMs, but not freshly prepared PBMCs, displayed elevated expression of CD11b and TLR2/4. TLR2 expression on CD11b+ MDMs was increased in the LP group compared with the HP group (P0.05) this is also shown in the representative dot plots of TLR2+ cells (L) which indicate the percentage positive cells. MDMs from LPs are hyper-sensitive to LPS, compared to HPs. production of each cytokine was exaggerated in MDMs prepared from LPs. PBMCs predominantly constitute lymphocytes and monocytes. CD11b expression is upregulated by many inflammatory mediators including cytokines. no difference in MDM CD14 mRNA was observed between groups. differentiation of monocytes to macrophages was similar in LP and HP individuals. MFI values for the HP and LP groups were 37.1 and 28.3 respectively. differentiated MDMs, but not freshly prepared PBMCs, displayed elevated expression of CD11b and TLR2/4. plasma isolated from LP groups displayed comparable levels of CRP. TLR2 expression on CD11b+ MDMs was increased in the LP group compared to the HP group (P = 0.056) this is also shown in the representative dot plots of TLR2+ cells (L) which indicate the percentage positive cells. MDMs from LPs are hyper-sensitive to LPS. production of each cytokine was exaggerated in MDMs prepared from LPs. ageing is associated with defects in both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. the innate immune system is associated with advancing age. intermediate stages between normal ageing and dementia are recognised by several classification systems. a method of detecting early changes in cognitive function relative to previous levels would be a significant advance. circulating monocytes are highly mobile and rapidly recruit to inflamed CNS tissue during bacterial infection [40], autoimmune disorders [41] and neurodegenerative disease [8]. circulating monocytes can infiltrate the CNS parenchyma and differentiate into microglia [42], where they are important for clearing amyloid and limiting its deposition in murine models of AD [43] PBMCs from the elderly have been reported to produce enhanced levels of IL-6 following LPS stimulation compared with controls. findings suggest that monocyte function is dysregulated both with age and in AD. but the present study significantly extends these observations to show that similar changes can be picked up in MDMs prepared from otherwise healthy adults. monocytes derived from elderly individuals display defective TLR signalling, particularly TLR1/2, with further decreases in relative TLR1 and TLR4 expression determined on peripheral blood monocytes from older subjects [61]. peripheral cell changes may provide a biological substrate indicative of the earliest discernible changes in episodic memory decline. CD14+ monocytes were cultured for 7 days with GM-CSF (10 ng/ml), and stained with a CD14 antibody to determine purity by flow cytometry."}
