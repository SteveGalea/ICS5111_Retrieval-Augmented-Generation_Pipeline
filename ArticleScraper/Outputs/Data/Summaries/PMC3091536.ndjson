{"summary": "study examined perceptions and behaviours of the general public during the early phase of the Influenza A (H1N1) pandemic in the Netherlands. results Between May and August 2009, the level of knowledge regarding Influenza A increased, while perceived severity of the new flu, perceived self-efficacy and intention to comply with preventive measures decreased. the influenza virus has become the dominant strain in most parts of the world. up to January 2010, around 14000 deaths related to the virus were reported worldwide. most severe cases and deaths have occurred in adults under 50 years of age, and severe respiratory failure has been reported more frequently in young and healthy persons. a number of studies have been published on risk perception and public responses in case of a pandemic influenza. these studies were conducted prior to the occurrence of the 2009 influenza pandemic, in times when pandemic influenza was not regarded as a high threat and information was based on hypothetical scenarios. the study consisted of a single, cross-sectional survey. there were confirmed cases in 82 countries, including 167 deaths. in the Netherlands, the number of confirmed cases had increased to 60. the second data collection period ended on 19 June; there were more than 200 deaths worldwide. the questionnaire was based on an integrated model to explain health behaviour. risk perception is specified as a combination of perceived severity and vulnerability. the PMT states that a high risk perception will lead to preventive behaviour only if response efficacy and self efficacy are also high. maladaptive responses may result in a lack of following advice from public health authorities. questionnaire concluded with items on amount of information received on influenza A. knowledge examined by statements concerning modes of transmission, infectiousness, feasibility of symptoms, and fatality of influenza A. all factors with a p-value 0.1 in the univariate analysis were entered in the multivariate model, and removed one-by-one. only statistically significant predictors (p 0.05) remained. the first survey started on 30 April 2009, when the first case of Influenza A (H1N1) was confirmed in the Netherlands. the panel meets high quality requirements and is ISO-certified. independent random samples were drawn of approximately 1000 panel members. panel members who participated in the first or second survey were excluded from further analyses. participants were asked about preventive measures against the new flu. 'avoiding crowded places', 'practicing better hygiene', 'wearing face mask','seeking medical advice with the onset of flu symptoms', 'taking antiviral medication' and'staying home from school or work' the Cronbach's alpha of the constructs ranged from 0.6 to 0.9. a summary score was formulated by adding up the scores of the individual items, and dichotomized on the median. thirty-eight percent of respondents had a lower education (i.e. primary education, lower general or lower vocational education or less), 36% an intermediate (i.e. secondary general or vocational education), and 26% a higher education (i.e. higher professional education or university). about three quarters were married or cohabitating and in 27% of the households there were one or more children under 18 years. of 6 items correctly increased significantly over time during the survey period, from 88% in May to 95% in August 2009. only knowledge regarding the availability of a vaccine decreased. the new flu is caused by a new influenza virus (incorrect) 74% 79% ns 84% 0.001 86% 0.001 ns + 2. 80% 67% 0.001 43% 0.001 39% 0.001 \u2014\u2014 3.

[20]. health authorities should not only communicate with the public about 'what is known' (the certainties), but they should also communicate about 'what is not known' (the uncertainties) in course of the outbreak, when more information becomes available, public health authorities should update their messages to achieve effective risk communication. emotional aspects like anxiety play a role in decision making concerning preventive behaviour.
