{"summary": "a study in Singapore showed a correlation between rapidly isolating patients after onset of symptoms and a decreased number of secondary cases among their contacts. in some cases, quarantined persons were allowed to leave the quarantine site with the permission of local health authorities if they wore masks. the modern concept of quarantine differs greatly from quarantine in past centuries. the modern concept emphasizes science-based interventions with attention to the medical, material, and mental health needs of quarantined persons. in the SARS epidemic, persons under quarantine were mostly confined at home and actively monitored for symptoms. the optimal management of contacts, stratified according to risk of becoming ill, remains under discussion in several countries. reports from canada indicate that the insidious onset of symptoms sometimes posed challenges for clinicians and public health officials. the optimal management of contacts, stratified according to risk of becoming ill, remains under discussion in several countries. the simultaneous introduction of a variety of measures was temporally associated with dramatic declines in new SARS cases. a case-control study in china-Hong Kong found that wearing a mask more frequently in public places may have been associated with increasing protection (15). inadequate data exist to evaluate the effect of distribution of most of these notices. china-mainland reported distributing 450,000 notices and detecting four SARS cases that may have been linked to the notices. no cases of SARS were detected by thermal scanning among >35 million international travelers scanned at entry during the SARS epidemic. temperatures of 13,839,500 travelers entering or leaving Beijing by air, train, or automobile identified 5,097 patients with probable SARS. in china-taiwan, incoming travelers from affected areas were quarantined. probable or suspected SARS was diagnosed in 21 (0.03%) of 80,813. no additional cases from airline travel were documented from countries with screening. transmission on commercial aircraft five commercial international flights were associated with transmission of SARS from patients with symptomatic probable cases to passengers and crew (1). notification of exposed passengers and studies of transmission risk were greatly hampered by difficulties in identifying and tracing passenger contacts (19\u201323) a study in Singapore showed a correlation between rapidly isolating patients after onset of symptoms and decreased number of secondary cases among their contacts. the location of quarantine was usually at home but was sometimes at a designated residential facility. in at least one area, these restrictions were applied to essential workers. quarantine was sometimes applied in an arbitrary and discriminatory fashion. the modern concept emphasizes science-based interventions with attention to the medical, material, and mental health needs of quarantined persons. exposed persons should be separated from symptomatic patients, monitored for the minimum time necessary. the insidious onset of symptoms sometimes posed challenges for clinicians and public health officials. a study in Singapore showed a correlation between rapidly isolating patients after onset of symptoms and decreased number of secondary cases among their contacts. the

optimal management of contacts, stratified according to risk of becoming ill, remains under discussion in several countries. the insidious onset of symptoms sometimes posed challenges for clinicians and public health officials. new interventions included urging the entire population of affected areas to measure their temperature at least once daily, fever telephone hotlines (14), and fever evaluation clinics with appropriate infection control measures. measures to increase social distance were implemented in areas where extensive unlinked community transmission of SARS-CoV was suspected. many people in these areas also chose to wear masks outside their homes. a case-control study in china-Hong Kong found wearing a mask more frequently in public places may have been associated with increasing protection. a case-control study in china-hong Kong found that wearing a mask more frequently in public places may have been associated with increasing protection. a mask \"frequently\" in public places, washing one's hands >10 times per day, and \"disinfecting living quarters thoroughly\" appeared to be protective. health alert notices, administering questionnaires to assess symptoms and possible exposure, visual inspection to detect symptoms, and thermal scanning may not distinguish between entry and exit screening. inadequate data exist to evaluate the effect of distribution of most of these notices. no cases of SARS were detected by thermal scanning among >35 million international travelers scanned at entry during the SARS epidemic. temperatures of 13,839,500 travelers entering or leaving Beijing by air, train, or automobile identified 5,097 patients with probable SARS. in china-taiwan, incoming travelers from affected areas were quarantined. probable or suspected SARS was diagnosed in 21 (0.03%) of 80,813. no additional cases were documented from countries with screening. transmission on commercial aircraft five commercial international flights were associated with transmission of SARS from patients with symptomatic probable cases to passengers and crew (1). the most comprehensive investigation, involving three flights with extensive passenger tracing and laboratory confirmation of index and secondary cases, a wide range of risk was noted. travel advisories were issued by WHO and various governments. compared with other sources of information to travelers, such as news media reports of SARS cases, is difficult to assess. Thailand reported having printed 1 million notices and detecting 113 cases of illness directly linked to the notices. twenty-four cases were suspected or probable SARS: all of which were detected at airports. a small percentage of persons completing entry health declaration questionnaires in affected areas were diagnosed with SARS. 10 of 952,200 domestic airline passengers and 2 of 5,246,100 train passengers had probable SARS. none of 275,600 international travelers who underwent temperature screening had SARS (5). anecdotes suggest exit screening may have helped dissuade ill persons from traveling by air. exit screening may have been more successful in dissuading local residents from traveling abroad. on nine flights arriving in Singapore, the incidence of transmission from passengers with SARS who had respiratory symptoms was estimated at 1 in 156 persons (21). a fourth study found no transmission to passengers seated near a patient who took multiple flights (22). an influenzalike illness developed within 3 days in 72% of passengers in a plane containing a person with symptomatic influenza and grounded for 3 hours without ventilation. if resources are limited, interventions at a country's international borders should not detract from efforts to identify and isolate infected persons within the country. in retrospect, although SARS-CoV was transmitted primarily through the respiratory droplet route, certain epidemiologic parameters facilitated its containment through public health interventions. traditional public health interventions will likely be required again to combat emerging or reemerging infection. for more readily transmissible infections, early and bold use of such interventions may contain transmission. nonmedical public health interventions may be the only measures available to combat epidemics. information."}
