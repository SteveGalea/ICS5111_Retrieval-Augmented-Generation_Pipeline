{"summary": "despite extensive experimental and theoretical investigations, how assembly-driven membrane deformation depends on protein properties, membrane properties, and membrane compositional inhomogeneity, remains incompletely understood. identifying factors that make viral budding robust will shed light on other biological processes in which high-order complexes assemble to reshape membranes. cytoplasm before envelopment is driven by assembly of viral transmembrane glycoproteins around the core (14) for all enveloped viruses, membrane deformation is driven at least in part by a combination of weak protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions. a critical question is whether viruses utilize microdomains primarily to concentrate capsid proteins or other molecules. Matthews and Likos (34\u201336) recently performed simulations on a coarse-grained model of patchy colloidal particles assembling on a membrane represented as a triangulated surface. these elegant simulations provided a first look at the process of simultaneous assembly and budding, and showed that subunit adsorption onto a membrane facilitates assembly through dimensional reduction. we find that a microdomain within the membrane can influence assembly and budding. membrane is represented by the model from Cooke and Deserno (58) each amphiphile is represented by one head bead and two tail beads connected by FENE bonds. this is an implicit solvent model; hydrophobic forces responsible for the formation of bilayers are mimicked by attractive interactions between tail beads with interaction strength 0. the domain line tension can be approximated by /kBT 22.9\u201324.7DM/0. the 10 repulsive interaction sites are arranged symmetrically above and below the pentagon plane, so as to favor a subunit-subunit angle consistent with a dodecahedron (116\u00b0). the attractors interact only with the domain lipid tails, except for simulations presented in Fig. S1. the attractors are placed one above each vertex and one above the center of the pentagon, each located a distance of 6 above the pentagon plane. simulations were performed on GPUs with a modified version HOOMD 0.10.1 (64,65) each capsomer was simulated as a rigid body using the Brownian dynamics algorithm. the code was modified to update rigid-body positions according to changes in the box size generated by the barostat. timescales for protein diffusion and association are only qualitative in a coarse-grained model. the computational cost required to include HI is large in our more detailed model. for most simulations of inhomogeneous membranes the membrane contained n = 16,200 lipids, including those belonging to the domain. phantom particles were added to the system to maintain a constant and equal ideal gas pressure above and below the membrane. capsomers were injected at 50 below the membrane midplane once all previously injected subunits were part of the same cluster. in the limit of inject = 0, all capsomers were placed randomly at distances between 30 and 50 below the membrane. the capsid subunit is a rigid body with a pentagonal base and radius of rpentamer = 5 formed by 15 attractive and 10 repulsive interaction sites. the capsid subunit is a rigid body with a pentagonal base and radius of rpentamer = 5. the 10 repulsive interaction sites are arranged symmetrically above and below the pentagon plane. the potential between capsomers and lipids accounts for attractive interactions and excluded-volume. the potential between capsomers and lipids accounts for attractive interactions and excluded-volume. the effective radius of the assembled capsid (not including the lipid coat) can be estimated from the distance between the attractors and the capsomer plane plus the capsid inradius. this is smaller than any enveloped virus, and thus our results are qualitative. we modified the rigid-body algorithm in HOOMD so that forces and torques were applied separately and isotropically. the code was modified to update rigid-body positions according to changes in the box size generated by the barostat at each time step. timescales to diffuse by one capsomer diameter (10) are d 250 for capsomers in solution. timescales to diffuse by one capsomer diameter (10) are d 250 for capsomers in solution. phantom particles were added to the system to maintain a constant and equal ideal gas pressure above and below the membrane. the first set of simulations considered budding via quasi-equilibrium states. this scenario corresponds to the limit of low subunit concentration and a rate of subunit protein translation or targeting of subunits to the membrane. capsid proteins adsorb onto the membrane slowly in comparison to assembly and membrane deformation timescales. timescales to diffuse by one capsomer diameter (10) are d 250 for capsomers in solution and D [500, 2500]0 on the membrane. for most simulations of inhomogeneous membranes the membrane contained n = 16,200 lipids, including those belonging to the domain. initial box size was 63.5 63.5 1003; additional simulations on larger membranes were performed to rule out finite size effects. the first set of simulations considered budding via quasi-equilibrium states. capsid proteins adsorb onto the membrane slowly in comparison to assembly and membrane deformation timescales. we performed simulations for a range of subunit-membrane interaction strengths ead, microdomain sizes rdomain, microdomain line tensions, and timescales for subunit association to the membrane inject. the results correspond to long but finite simulation times, at which point assembly outcomes appeared roughly independent of increasing simulation time. the homogeneous membrane inhibits complete assembly. assembly of membrane-absorbed subunits required large subunit-subunit interactions. assembly slows dramatically after formation of a half-capsid (six subunits) the nature of subsequent assembly depends on the adhesion strength. adsorption to a membrane has mixed effects on assembly. similar effects occur during assembly on a polymer (54\u201356,73,75,76) formation of a completely enveloped capsid incurs a membrane bending free energy cost of 8 independent of capsid size (77). stalled assembly states resemble the partially assembled states predicted theoretically. partially wrapped capsids are consistent with partially wrapped states found for preassembled particle. a second impediment arises because subunit-membrane attractions are reduced in regions where the membrane curvature is large on the length scale of the rigid subunit. we first consider budding in the quasi-equilibrium limit. effect of line tension and adhesion energy Fig. 3 shows the predominant final system configurations as a function of ead and line tension. the membrane undergoes scission through spontaneous fusion of the neck to release the membrane-enveloped capsid. analysis of simulation trajectories identified three mechanisms by which the domain facilitates assembly. first, partitioning of adsorbed proteins into the domain generates a high local subunit concentration. however, in simulations in which the degree of subunit partitioning into the domain was varied, the outcome was insensitive to this parameter. the length of the interface as a function of number of subunits n in a partial capsid is given by l int ( n, r domain ) = 2 [ r domain 2 ( 2 R capsid n / N ) 2 ] 1 / 2, (1) with N = 12 the number of subunits in a capsid and Rcapsid 15.3 as the capsid radius. formation of a long neck is governed by a competition between the loss of subunit-membrane adhesion energy associated with partial detachment from the capsid and the reduction in interfacial energy caused by the extended neck. the free energy difference between tightly wrapped capsids and extended necks is approximately calculated in Fig. S9. higher values of ead promote tight wrapping with strong curvature of the capsid. for small and ead, the capsid assembles but wrapping is incomplete. for small and ead, the capsid assembles but wrapping is incomplete. stalled assembly with wrapping (red) and malformed assembly (violet) there is an optimal domain size 1\u20132 times the area of a wrapped capsid (35 rdomain 40) that leads to robust assembly and budding over a broad range of adhesion energies ead. the most frequent outcome is shown for every set of parameters. the predominant end-products are shown as a function of the subunit injection timescale inject and the adhesion strength ead. the most frequent outcome is shown for every set of parameters. kinetic traps occur when annealing timescales exceed the subunit binding timescale. for smaller-than-optimal adhesion energies, assemblages are loosely wrapped and the entire domain undergoes budding once the assemblage reaches a threshold size. shortest injection timescales lead to large flat aggregates that do not bend the membrane. assembly on a homogeneous membrane requires large subunit-subunit interactions. assembly slows dramatically after formation of a half-capsid (six subunits) the nature of subsequent assembly depends on the adhesion strength. assembled but partially wrapped capsids for (A) ead = 0.1 and (B) ead = 0.15. a deformed, open structure forms for ead = 0.4. results show that adsorption to a membrane has mixed effects on assembly. the membrane-induced barrier to assembly arises in part due to the small capsid size and relatively large subunits of our model. however, the barrier is intrinsic to assembly of a spherical or convex polygonal structure on a deformable two-dimensional manifold, and thus will exist for any such model. the presence of a domain can exert on assembly and budding. i.e., the domain line tension is insufficient to drive budding. we first consider budding in the quasi-equilibrium limit. the complete distribution of outcome frequencies and assembly times are shown for some parameter sets in Fig. S11 and Fig. S12. the membrane wraps the growing capsid until the complete, enveloped capsid is connected to the rest of the membrane by a narrow neck (E) the length of the interface as a function of number of subunits n in a partial capsid is given by l int ( n, r domain ) = 2 [ r domain 2 ( 2 R capsid n / N ) 2 ] 1 / 2, with N = 12 the number of subunits in a capsid and Rcapsid 15.3 as the capsid radius. the significance of this effect and consequently the ability of a domain formation of a long neck is governed by a competition between the loss of subunit-membrane adhesion energy associated with partial detachment from the capsid and the reduction in interfacial energy caused by the extended neck. the free energy difference between tightly wrapped capsids and extended necks is approximately calculated in Fig. S9. rdomain > 2Rcapsid and intermediates beyond a half-capsid (n > N/2) wrapping of the intermediate produces curvature incommensurate with whole-domain budding. ead promote tight wrapping with strong curvature of the capsid. the color code represents the outcome type and follows the same format as in Fig. 3: successful assembly (green), complete assembly but incomplete wrapping (orange), stalled assembly with wrapping (red) and malformed assembly (violet) there is an optimal domain size 1\u20132 times the area of a wrapped capsid (35 rdomain 40) that leads to robust assembly. subunit injection timescales eject are shown between the quasi-equilibrium limit and 0, where all subunits were introduced at the inception of the simulation. the most frequent outcome is shown for every set of parameters. assemblages are loosely wrapped and the entire domain undergoes budding. for larger ead, malformed aggregates are tightly wrapped by the membrane. the shortest injection timescales and largest adhesion energies lead to large flat aggregates that do not bend the membrane. for adhesion strengths between 0.3 and 0.4 0, budding is observed. larger values of ead lead to the forms of kinetic traps discussed above. ead and line tensions lead to complete assembly and budding. the complete distribution of outcome frequencies and assembly times are shown for some parameter sets in Fig. S11 and Fig. S12. the complete distribution of outcome frequencies and assembly times are also shown for some parameter sets. the length of the interface as a function of number of subunits n in a partial capsid is given by l int ( n, r domain ) = 2 [ r domain 2 ( 2 R capsid n / N ) 2 ] 1 / 2, (1) with N = 12 the number of subunits in a capsid and Rcapsid 15.3 as the capsid radius. the significance of this effect and consequently the ability of a formation of a long neck is governed by a competition between the loss of subunit-membrane adhesion energy associated with partial detachment from the capsid and the reduction in interfacial energy caused by the extended neck. the free energy difference between tightly wrapped capsids and extended necks is approximately calculated in Fig. S9. rdomain > 2Rcapsid and intermediates beyond a half-capsid produce curvature incommensurate with whole-domain budding. higher values of ead promote tight wrapping with strong curvature of the capsid. for small and ead, the capsid assembles but wrapping is incomplete. partial capsid intermediates stabilize membrane deformation over an area proportional to their size, and thus drive budding within domains below a threshold size (Eq. 3). partial capsid intermediates stabilize membrane deformation over an area proportional to their size, and thus drive budding within domains below a threshold size (Eq. 3). the behavior of such domains is therefore comparable to that in a homogeneous membrane. the most frequent outcome is shown for every set of parameters. the predominant end-products are shown as a function of the adhesion strength and the subunit injection timescale inject. the ultimate fate of these large aggregates depends on the adhesion energy ead. for smaller-than-optimal adhesion energies, assemblages are loosely wrapped. malformed aggregates are tightly wrapped by the membrane and remain attached by a neck. a fluctuating membrane can promote assembly through dimensional reduction. but it also can inhibit complete assembly by limiting orientational fluctuations and diffusion of adsorbed subunits. these effects, which are not present for assembly in bulk solution (73), can engender metastable partially assembled or partially budded structures. the effective diameter of our enveloped T = 1 capsid is 28 nm. the smallest enveloped viruses found in nature have diameters of 40\u201350 nm. the relationship between particle size and budding has been explored in detail for preassembled nucleocapsids. we have set the material constants equal for the domain and background lipid species (e.g., bending modulus and fluidity) to minimize the number of model parameters, we have set the material constants (e.g., bending modulus and fluidity)."}
