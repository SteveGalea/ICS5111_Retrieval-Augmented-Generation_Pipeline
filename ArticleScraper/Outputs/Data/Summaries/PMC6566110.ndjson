{"summary": "EV71-induced HFMD is more serious out of the two because it causes a neurological syndrome of the central nervous system. the morbidity and mortality are lower compared with EV71-induced HFMD (4). EV71 is not the only major cause of HFMD outbreak. clinical symptoms of HFMD caused by EV71 and EV71 strains are indistinguishable. EV71 can recombine viral genes with CVA16 and produce novel viral variants. in 2008, a large-scale outbreak of HFMD caused by EV71 and EV71 recombinant virus occurred in the city of Fuyang, China. cross antiviral activity of IgY against EV71 and CVA16 strains was assessed. white Leghorn specific-pathogen-free chickens were immunized with inactivated EV71 strains. a specific IgY was prepared from egg yolk. RD cells were cultured in virus-containing medium at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2-humidified incubator. cells were frozen-thawed at 80\u00b0C, centrifuged at 2,000 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C and filtered on a 0.22-M filter for storage. chickens were raised in 3 super-clean benches (Suzhou Antai Airtech Co.

RD cells were inoculated with 300 l of the mixture and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 48 h to promote the antibody binding to the viruses. Neutralization titers were determined as the highest dilutions of antibody that protected at least half of RD cells in one well from CPE. diluted IgY was incubated at different temperatures (4\u00b0C, room temperature, 37\u00b0C or 60\u00b0C) for 48 h or was frozen-thawed five times. serially diluted IgY (1:300, 1:600 and 1:1,200) was mixed with an equal volume of EV71 strains (200 TCID50) RD cells were cultured in virus-containing medium at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2-humidified incubator. when RD cells reached 80% confluence, cells were frozen-thawed at 80\u00b0C. chickens were raised in 3 super-clean benches and had access to food and water. after 1 week, laying chickens were divided into two groups: Group A and Group B. eggs were collected once a day, labeled and stored at 4\u00b0C. the solution was incubated at 4\u00b0C for 3 h and centrifuged again. the sediment was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) the solution was dialyzed for 4\u20135 h. the wells were washed 5 times (30 min each time) with a washing buffer provided in an EV71 Ab ELISA kit. the plate was incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-chicken anti-chicken antibody (1:2,000; abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) at 37\u00b0C for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. EV71 VP1 vaccine was quantified using a bicinchoninic acid assay (cat. no. P0015L; Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Haimen, China) was added to samples (4:1) and denatured by heating in a metal water bath at 95\u00b0C for 10 min. samples (20 g protein/lane) were separated via SDS-PAGE on 10 and 5% gels. membranes were washed five times with Tris-b the inactivated EV71 virus was added to the central well. the plate was placed upside down in a 60\u00b0C-wet box and incubated for 24\u201348 h. a blank group (PBS only) was also assessed. RD cells seeded in a 96-well plate at a density of 1104 cells/well. the cells were incubated for 48 h at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2-humidified incubator. the presence of cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed under a microscope. Neutralization titers were determined as the highest dilutions of antibody that protected at least half of RD cells in one well from CPE. antibodies were mixed with an equal volume of 200 TCID50 of EV71, CVA16, CVB1, CVB2, CVB3, CVB4, CVB5 and CVB6 strains. diluted IgY was incubated at different temperatures (4\u00b0C, room temperature, 37\u00b0C or 60\u00b0C) for 48 h or was frozen-thawed. serially diluted IgY (1:300, 1:600 and 1:1,200) was mixed with an equal volume of EV71 strains (200 TCID50) the study was performed to isolate and purify S-IgY from EV71-immunized chicken egg yolks. the levels of S-IgY were detected at day 7 and maintained at a higher level compared with C-IgY for a total of 4 weeks. titers of the viruses were determined using the TCID50 assay. the TCID50 for the EV71 strain was 107.1 TCID50/ml. the TCID50 for the EV71 strain was 106.3 TCID50/ml. the purity of the IgY was determined to be over 85%. the purified IgY cross binds to the structural proteins VP0, VP1 and VP3 of EV71 and CVA16. the titer of the purified IgY was measured with a bidirectional immune agar diffusion test. the VP1 recombinant protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane and detected with the specific IgY or negative control IgY. the results of western blotting further confirmed that the S-IgY exhibited a good immunological binding reaction with the viral proteins of EV71 and CVA16. neither EV71 nor CVA16 had immunoreactivity with C-IgY. RD cells in the EV71 non-infected groups were normal and healthy. different degrees of CPE (atrophied, rounded, shedding and apoptosis) appeared in the blank control group, the C-IgY group and the Envrioxime group. RD cells did not exhibit CPE in the S-IgY group. CVA16-infected RD cells were treated with different concentrations of the C-IgY, the isolated S-IgY or Envrioxime. the ability of the antibodies to inhibit CPE was determined using the neutralization assay. RD cells were infected with EV71 and treated with IgY (0.4, 0.8, or 1.6 g/ml) after exposure of the IgY to different temperatures for 48 h, or by freezing-thawing for five times. CPE values were expressed relative to those for cells with no antibody treatment. there was no decrease in antiviral activity observed with S-IgY after freeze thawing five times. results showed that the S-IgY had a strong inhibitory activity against EV71 and CVA16 strains (P0.001) but had only marginal or no antiviral activity in the 6 other strains of enterovirus examined. six 39-week-old single comb white leghorn specific-pathogen-free chickens were immunized. 3 chickens were immunized with enterovirus 71 antigens and Freund's incomplete adjuvant. the other 3 chickens were injected with saline and Freund's incomplete adjuvant. IgY cross binds to the structural proteins VP0, VP1 and VP3 of EV71 and CVA16. the purity of the purified IgY was determined to be over 85%. directional immune agar diffusion test for EV71 and (D) CVA16. western blotting of the immunoreactivity of the specific IgY. the purified IgY cross blocks the CPE induced by EV71 and CVA16 in vitro. the protective effect of the purified IgY on enterovirus-induced CPE was assessed by neutralization assay in vitro. RD cells in the EV71 non-infected groups were normal and healthy. RD cells were infected with or without EV71. the cells were treated with PBS (blank control), negative control IgY (C-IgY), S-IgY or Envrioxime. a representative image from each treatment group is indicated (magnification, 400) Y was added 2 h post-infection, and inhibited >40% of EV71-induced CPE when the IgY was added 3 h post-infection. RD cells were infected with EV71 and treated with C-IgY or S-IgY at different time points following EV71 infection. RD, rhabdomyosarcoma; IgY, immunoglobulin Y; EV71, enterovirus 71; C-IgY, negative control IgY; S-IgY, specific IgY; CPE, cytopathic effect. the stability of antiviral activity was determined for the isolated IgY. the levels of S-IgY began to decrease gradually at week 11. the levels of the C-IgY group did not change significantly over the experimental period. from these findings it was concluded that the isolated IgY from week 7 chicken egg yolks after EV71 antigen immunization would be purified and used for the following experiments. the TCID50 for CVA16 strain was 106.3 TCID50/ml. the results of SDS-PAGE showed that the disulfide bond of the target protein was opened under reduction conditions. the presence of the two dominant bands, a 70-kDa-sized species that represents the H chain, was noted. a white precipitation line was identified between the antigen hole in the center and the antibody wells with dilution ratios of 1:2, 1:4, and 1:8, but no precipitation line was indicated between the PBS wells and the antigen wells. the purified S-IgY has the ability to specifically cross bind to the antigens of EV71 and CVA16. western blotting of the immunoreactivity of the specific IgY was assessed. the proteins of EV71 and CVA16 viruses in the samples were identified to be 36 kDa for VP1 and 28 kDa for VP3. the predicted molecular weights of the VP1 protein of EV71 and CVA16 were 35 kDa and 26 kDa for VP3. RD cells did not exhibit CPE in the S-IgY group, suggesting a protecting effect of the specific IgY on EV71 infection in RD cells. the results in Fig. 4C revealed that the IgY had a strong anti-CVA16 activity in vitro at the concentrations of 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 g/ml. RD cells were infected with EV71 and treated with IgY (0.4, 0.8, or 1.6 g/ml) RD cells were infected with EV71 and treated with IgY (0.4, 0.8, or 1.6 g/ml) after exposure of the IgY to different temperatures for 48 h, or by freezing-thawing for five times. values were expressed relative to those for cells with no antibody treatment. RD cells were infected with eight different enterovirus strains. the cells were treated with the C-IgY, the S-IgY or Mab. EV71 and CVA16 belong to the small RNA family and enterovirus genus. VP4 is located inside the capsid and connects with RNA. VP1, VP2 and VP3 are located on the surface of the capsid. IgY is the sum of antibodies extracted from egg yolk of immunized chickens. the total IgY produced by an immunized chicken in a year is 20 times as much as the IgG produced by a rabbit (51). the antibody levels decreased gradually after week 11. the high titer, suitable purity and long duration of the IgY in the immunized egg yolks make it possible for manufacturing plants to prepare a large quantity of IgY. findings provide a scientific basis for developing IgY as a cross passive immunotherapy. competing interests The authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
