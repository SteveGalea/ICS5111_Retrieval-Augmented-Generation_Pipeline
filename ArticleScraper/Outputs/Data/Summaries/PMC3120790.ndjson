{"summary": "avian influenza viruses of the H9N2 subtype have become highly prevalent in poultry in many countries. they can infect a wide variety of species, including chickens, quail, turkeys, ducks, geese, pheasant, partridge, and pigeon. BV-Dual-HA could be used as a vaccine candidate against H9N2 virus infection. inactivated avian influenza vaccines can induce little or no cellular immune response. baculovirus Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) has traditionally been an excellent tool to overexpress recombinant proteins in insect cells. baculoviral vectors have been exploited as versatile vaccine vehicles. a chimeric HA with SP and CT derived from gp64 was chosen for our study. the results showed stronger immune responses were induced in a mouse model immunized with BV-Dual-HA than in those vaccinated with a DNA vaccine. cell lines and virus A porcine kidney PK-15 cell line free of PCV1 contamination (ATCC CCL 33) were maintained in modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen, USA) and supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS); 100 g/ml of streptomycin, and 100 IU/mL of penicillin. a 2.3-kb fragment of a chimeric HA gene was excised from psurf-HA by digestion with NheI and HindIII. the cassette consisted of the CMV-IE promoter; chimeric HA gene was amplified by PCR and subcloned into a pFastBacTM plasmid. the resultant BV-Dual-HA plasmid thus contained separate HA genes driven by C PK-15 cells were seeded at a concentration of 2.5 105 cells/well into 6-well tissue culture plates (Corning Costar Co., Cambridge, MA, USA) after 48 h incubation, the cells were fixed with absolute methanol for 5 min at -20\u00b0C, rinsed with PBS, and blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. the cells were then incubated with the primary anti-body (anti-HA mAb) for 3 mice from each group were sacrificed and the lungs, brains, livers, kidneys, and spleens were harvested. the viral titer, expressed as EID50 (50% egg infection dose), was calculated by the Reed-Muench method. differences between groups were considered significant at P 0.05. the low-pathogenicity influenza A/Chicken/Guangzhou/V/2008(H9N2) virus was isolated in china. it is a mouse-adapted H9N2 strain that can cause infection and death in mice. baculovirus BV-Dual-HA was produced using the Bac-to-Bac\u00ae system. titers were determined with the BD BacPAK baculovirus rapid titer kit. the grids were incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG labeled with 5-nm gold particles. fluorescence images were examined under an inverted fluorescence microscope. three groups were vaccinated intramuscularly (i.m.) with 109 PFU of BV-Dual-HA, 109 PFU of wild-type AcMNPV (AcMNPV-WT) and 100 g of pc-HA. mice were weighed daily and examined for disease. BV-Dual-HA harbored a gene cassette that consisted of the gp64 signal peptide, HA ectodomain gene, HA TM, CTD derived from gp64, and poly(A) the dual promoter consisted of the CMV immediate early enhancer-promoter and the polyhedrin promoter drove expression of the gene cassette. thus, a chimeric HA protein was designed to express both proteins on the viral envelope and in ma BV-Dual-HA (C) and AcMNPV-WT (D) were treated with anti-HA monoclonal antibodies, followed by labeling with anti-mouse IgG-gold conjugate. one end of the viral envelopes was strongly labeled with gold particles. BV-Dual-HA, pc-HA, AcMNPV-WT or PBS were challenged with 50 MLD50 of H9N2 V strain on day 42. the immunized mice showed serious weight loss (Figure 4A) and signs of illness. the survival rates in the BV-Dual-HA, pc-HA, and AcMNPV-WT groups at 14 days post-challenge were 100%, 66.7%, and 75%, no virus was detected in the lungs of mice immunized with BV-Dual-HA. the viral titers in the brains, kidneys, and spleens were also analyzed. they were much lower than that in the lungs. gp64 signal peptide (SP), the HA ectodomain gene, the HA transmembrane domain (TM), gp64 cytoplasmic domain (CTD) and poly(A) could be detected by HA mAb in BV-Dual-HA transduced cells, but not in cells transduced with AcMNPV-Wt (Figure 2B) antibody responses in immunized mice Immunization with BV-Dual-HA induced the highest levels of H9-specific HI antibodies and VN antibodies. at 20 days after primary immunization, all the mice developed detectable H9-specific HI antibodies and VN antibodies. the survival rates in the BV-Dual-HA, pc-HA, and AcMNPV-WT groups at 14 days post-challenge were 100%, 66.7%, and 75%, respectively. to determine the virus titers in tissues, 3 mice in each group were sacrificed on day 6 post-challenge. c-HA ND 4.05 0.54 ND ND AcMNPV-WT ND 4.58 0.38 1.25 ND PBS 1 0.78 5.17 0.29 ND a Each value represents the mean of 3 mice from each group. results are expressed as the EID50 /0.2 mL and presented as mean S.D. pc-HA expressed HA and functioned like a DNA vaccine. transduction by a recombinant baculovirus was 55 times more efficient than DNA transfection. this is consistent with a previous study that found immunization with wild-type baculovirus provided 75% protection from the H9N2 influenza lethal challenge. baculoviruses have strong adjuvant properties in mice, promoting potent humoral and CD8+ T cell adaptive responses against co-administered antigens. previously studies have proved that baculovirus expressing PRRSV GP5 and M protein [31], PCV2 Cap protein [32], H5N1 virus HA protein [33], Pseudorabies virus glycoproteins[34] could induced a high level of IFN- a simple scale-up would be sufficient to produce a high-titer recombinant baculovirus. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors should be considered as first authors."}
