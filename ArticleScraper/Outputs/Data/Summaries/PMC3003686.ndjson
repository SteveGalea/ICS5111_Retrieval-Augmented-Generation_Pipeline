{"summary": "Vaccines have played an important role in disease prevention and have made a substantial contribution to public health. most of the currently approved vaccines work by inducing humoral immunity [1]\u2013[3] for protection against viruses that are highly mutable and frequently escape from antibody-mediated immunity. liposome-coupled antigens are expected to be applicable for the development of viral vaccines without inducing antigen-specific IgEs. liposome-coupled antigens were cross-presented by APCs to CD8+ T cells by confocal laser scanning microscopy. two hours after the onset of the culture, macrophages were recovered and analyzed using confocal laser scanning microscopy. these optically merged images are representative of most cells examined by confocal microscopy. yellow, co-localization of green (DQ-OVA after proteolytic degradation) macrophages were recovered and analyzed using flow cytometry. effects of inhibitors on uptake of liposome-coupled antigens by APCs. cytochalasin B and DMA inhibit APC phagocytosis. antigens and intracellular organelles in the APCs were analyzed using confocal laser scanning microscopy. most of the DQ-OVA coupled to oleoyl liposomes was processed beyond LAMP-1-expressing compartments (yellow spots) co-localization of EEA1-expressing compartments with liposome-coupled-DQ-OVA was significantly less than that of LAMP-1-expressing compartments with DQ-OVA. antigen presentation by APCs pulsed with liposomal antigen was significantly inhibited by DMA but not by cytochalasin B in both CD4+- and CD8+ T cell responses. splenic CD4/CD8+ T cells were taken from mice immunized with OVA after co-culture with CD11c+ cells pulsed with oleoyl liposomes. macrophages were analyzed using confocal laser scanning microscopy. the results shown in Fig. 1 demonstrate that DQ-OVA coupled to oleoyl liposomes was processed at both MHC class I and class II compartments. most of the DQ-OVA coupled to stearoyl liposomes was processed at the MHC class II compartment. Alexa-labeled OVA was coupled to oleoyl liposomes but not stearoyl liposomes were internalized significantly by APCs even in a 4\u00b0C environment. macrophages were recovered and analyzed using flow cytometry. treatment of macrophages with cytochalasin B or DMA was done 60 minutes prior to the addition of OVA-liposome conjugates. localization of liposome-coupled antigens and intracellular organelles in the APCs was analyzed using confocal laser scanning microscopy. -OVA after proteolytic degradation) and red (macrophage EEA1 or LAMP-1); cell only, macrophages without co-culture with DQ-OVA liposomes. data represent mean values SD of the images shown in Fig, 4A. exogenous antigens usually do not prime CTL responses in vivo. this is important to prevent CTL from killing healthy cells that have been exposed to foreign antigens. however, there are several exceptions to this rule, reflecting the ability of the exogenous antigens to be delivered into the cytosolic compartments [13]\u2013[17]. the role of endocytosis in the uptake of the liposomal antigen was further examined by using specific inhibitors for antigen uptake. antigens coupled to oleoyl liposomes may be taken up by APCs via at least two pathways, penetration and pinocytosis. antigens coupled to oleoyl liposomes were internalized by APCs through both penetration and pinocytosis. coupling of antigens to oleoyl liposome might potentially serve as a novel method to induce humoral and cellular immunity. liposomes consisting of saturated fatty acids were composed of distearoyl phosphatidylcholine, distearoyl phosphatidylcholine, distearoyl phosphatidyl ethanolamine, distearoyl phosphatidyl glycerol acid. liposomes consisting of unsaturated fatty acids were composed of dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine, dioleoyl the amount of lipid in the liposomal fraction was measured using a phospholipid content assay kit (Wako Pure Chemical) the solution was adjusted to 10 mg lipid/ml in PBS, sterile-filtered using a millex-HA syringe filter unit. radio-labeled OVA coupled to liposome was mixed with cold OVA. the PCR product was cloned into the CMV promoter-driven expression plasmid pDsRedN1 (BD Clontech) this construct omitted the stop codon of H2-DM2 and encoded the H2-DM2 fused with DsRed. clone 39 was cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS with 50 g/ml geneticin. macrophage clone 39 or DM-DsRed-expressing cloned macrophage 39 was cultured for 18 h at 37\u00b0C on 8-hole heavy Teflon-coated slides. they were then incubated for 10 min in 0.1 M glycine-HCl (pH 7.0) to block the remaining aldehyde residue. after fixing, they were incubated for 10 min in 0.1 M glycine-HCl mouse anti-mouse H-2Dd mAb (34-2-12, 10 g/ml; BD Biosciences) or rat anti-mouse LAMP-1 monoclonal antibody (N19, 1 g/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 18 h at 4\u00b0C. after being washed three times with TBS, they were reacted with Alexa 546-conjugated streptavidin. or CD11c+ cells were incubated with indicated inhibitors 60 min before and throughout the antigen pulse. the final concentration of OVA-liposome added to the macrophage culture was 500 g lipid/ml, which included 24 g OVA. phospholipids were provided by NOF Co. (Tokyo, Japan) antigens and reagents Ovalbumin (OVA, Grade VII) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. crude liposome solution passed through membrane filter with a pore size of 0.2 mm. mixture of 90 mg of liposomes and 6 mg of OVA in 2.5 ml phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) was added in dropwise fashion to block excess aldehyde groups. the amounts of OVA coupled to stearoyl and oleoyl liposomes were 47.0 and 46.8 g/mg lipid, respectively. the amounts of OVA coupled to stearoyl and oleoyl liposomes were 47.0 and 46.8 g/mg lipid. clone 39 was cultured for 18 h at 37\u00b0C on 8-hole heavy Teflon-. cells showed the best fluorescence were selected using a FACS Vantage cell sorter. after cell sorting, clone 39 expressing DM-DsRed was cultured. coated slides were then washed with oleoyl or stearoyl liposome conjugates. they were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. after fixing, they were incubated for 10 min in 0.1 M glycine-HCl (pH 7.0) to block the remaining aldehyde residue. after washing, the slides were sealed with PBS:glycerin (19) I, Alexa Fluor 568-labeled Ab (goat anti-rat IgG, 10 g/ml; Invitrogen) to detect EEA1 or Alexa Fluor 568-labeled Ab (goat anti-rat IgG, 10 g/ml; Invitrogen) to detect LAMP-1 for 4 h at room temperature. slides were sealed with PBS:glycerin (19) and analyzed under an LSM510 confo the final concentration of OVA-liposome added to the macrophage culture was 500 g lipid/ml, which included 24 g OVA. after 60 minutes' incubation, CD11c+ cells were washed 3 times in ice-cold medium and 2105 cells were co-cultured with 5105 CD4+ T cells."}
