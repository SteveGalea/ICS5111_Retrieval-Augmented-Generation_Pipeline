{"summary": "traditional infectious disease threats like smallpox, plague, yellow fever, and cholera prevented nations from ensuring stability and well-being of their populations for centuries. in some countries, such diseases contributed to border conflicts and other disputes. early attempts to control them led to the actual development of public health programs in most countries. the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) pandemic had emerged to impose challenges to global health security. by 1990, in countries of Latin America and the Caribbean the polio eradication initiative was well underway to achieve the eradication target. the program was severely threatened by the emergence of a cholera epidemic in Peru in early 1991. the global mechanism was immediately challenged to address major outbreaks like the re-emergence of the Ebola and Marburg virus threats in Africa. in 2003, the world was shocked again with the first global pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). the new IHR(2005) include a broad scope of work. case definitions of diseases, public health emergency of international concern, and public health risks are intended to be more unambiguous with analytic tools. jungle yellow fever occurs in tropical rainforest areas where wild mosquitoes, Haemagogus, can infect monkeys with yellow fever virus. infected mosquitoes can transmit the virus to humans who enter the rainforest. urban transmission is not dependent upon the monkey reservoir. paraguay was able to implement a timely and rapid vaccination response. before the arrival of vaccines, civil disturbance was mounting in the face of public panic. the political and technical collaboration led to improved global health. a pandemic infuenza has killed more than 18,000 people and infected thousands of people across the world. the pandemic was not as severe as many predicted, but even so, many pregnant women died. many experts concluded that the response was necessary. the global alert and response to this pandemic has been described above. the global public health community has unprecedented support to respond to global pandemics and public health emergencies of international concern. if the pandemic had been more severe, the consequences would have been enormous. authors wish to thank the world health organization and his team for the excellent support provided to the pandemic response. the full contents of the supplement are available online at http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/10\"issue=S1."}
