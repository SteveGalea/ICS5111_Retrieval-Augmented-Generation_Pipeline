{"summary": "the odds of being infected with Cryptosporidium spp. increased continuously up to 4.5 times until an age of 10 days. the odds of being infected with Eimeria spp. increased continuously up to 30 times from about 20 days to 60 days of age. 1282 samples were analysed for E. coli, Rota-, Coronavirus and Cryptosporidium spp. using an ELISA. Obtained frequencies for these pathogens were 0.9%, 37.8%, 3.4% and 45.3% with a mean age of 24.8 days, 12.1 days, 9.0 days and 12.1 days. many of the different species and genotypes of the genus Cryptosporidium, partly with zoonotic potential, are morphologically indistinguishable. one of them is C. parvum, a zoonotic genotype often found in young calves and also able to infect humans, hence making the former a source of infection for humans. differentiation between these viral, bacterial and parasitic agents is only possible by a diagnostic test but not by clinical examination. there are no recent data available for southern Germany. it is important for practitioners to know the frequency of various pathogens in a certain area. sample analysis All samples were analysed for Giardia spp., Cryptosporidium spp. and Eimeria spp. using microscopic methods at 200-400x magnifications. a direct faecal smear of each sample was carbolfuchsin-stained [25], which also allowed to detect Eimeria-oocysts. s and oocysts, differentiating Eimeria-oocysts and genotyping Cryptosporidium spp. by PCR were not performed because of logistic, personnel and financial reasons. t-test for independent samples and an ANOVA were performed to investigate the differences in the mean age of the sampled animals in the single months. sample analysis All samples were analysed for Giardia spp., Cryptosporidium spp. and Eimeria spp. using microscopic methods at 200-400x magnifications. a direct faecal smear of each sample was carbolfuchsin-stained [25], which also allowed to detect Eimeria-oocysts.

[48], who found a significantly increasing risk of an Eimeria-infection until 3 months of age. prevalence of both parasites was highest in 2-week old calves. this is because it is thought that Rotavirus is a primary pathogen causing diarrhoea in neonatal calves."}
