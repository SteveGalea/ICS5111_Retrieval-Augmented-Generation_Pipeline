{"summary": "LT is a major virulence factor and consists of 2 proteins, protective antigen (PA) and lethal factor (LF) symptoms in animals that died after receiving an intravenous injection of purified LT were similar to those in animals that died because of natural infections. hemorrhage is one of the major manifestations observed in patients and experimental animals with anthrax. a low platelet count in mice does not necessarily lead to hemorrhage, unless additional complications are present. however, the low plasma FVIII levels and hemorrhage in animals injected with LT can be ameliorated by the supplementary treatment of FVIII. the induction of circulating sP-sel in LT-treated mice may theoretically aid the host to survive the hemorrhage pathogenesis. hypoxic tissue injury may be involved in anthrax LT-mediated toxicity in mice. sP-sel signals in the plasma can be detected in both P-sel-positive MPs and sP-sel molecules released from cells (non-MP-bound form) the recombinant sP-sel increases the circulating MP count, and the interaction of P-sel with PSGL-1 is crucial for the increase of the MP count. plasma soluble P-selectin (sP-sel) levels in mice treated with PA and LT for 72 h are shown (F) normal saline was used for the vehicle treatments (E, F) treatments of normal saline were used the vehicle controls (C-E) increased sP-sel levels have been observed in certain diseases associated with platelet abnormalities. recombinant P-sel and P-sel-Fc treatments can induce a procoagulant state. studies have reported that the procoagulant effect of P-sel-Fc treatments may be contributed to the PSGL-1-dependent generation of TF-positive MPs. however, P-sel-Fc markedly increased the TF-positive MP count in wild-type mice that did or did not receive LT treatments. recalcification plasma clotting time and tissue factor-positive MPs. compared with wild-type and PSGL-1 KO mice, sP-sel KO mice are more sensitive to LT treatments because they do not contain. sP-sel requires functional PSGL-1 to increase the TF-positive MP count. both P-sel and PSGL-1 KO mice indeed die rapidly after lethal dose LT treatments. LT induced markedly higher mortality in both P-sel and PSGL-1 KO mice. sP-sel treatments improved the hemostasis of mice with FVIII deficiency. mice were treated with P-sel-Fc 4 h before a lethal dose of LT was administered. plasma leakage and blood parameters revealed P-sel-mediated rescue. et al. the American Society of Hematology. reproduced by permission of Hsin-Hou Chang. permission to reuse must be obtained from the rightsholder. 72 results suggest that P-sel-Fc treatments can successfully reduce anthrax LT-mediated pathogenesis in patients. izing antibody did not rescue LT-treated mice. no statistical significant differences between control Ig vs. anti-P-sel Ig. a single dose of P-sel-Fc rescued mice. n = 12 (A-B, and spore + control Ig groups in C; 3 experiments with 4 mice/group; n = 17 (PA groups and spore + P-sel-Fc groups in C; 3 experiments with 4 mice/group; 1 experiment with 5 mice/group); n = 5 (albumin groups in C; 2 experiments with 2 and 3 mice/group); n = 5 (albumin groups in C; 2 experiments with 2 and 3 mice/group); n increased sP-sel levels have been observed in various hemorrhagic diseases such as dengue hemorrhagic fever,39 immune thrombocytopenia,44,45 and subarachnoid hemorrhage 46. however, the role of sP-sel in these disorders remains elusive. sP-sel levels increased in both MP-bound fractions and non-MP-bound fractions. recombinant P-sel-Fc treatment still markedly ameliorated LT toxicity in mice. basal count of MPs and LT-induced MPs was lower in the Selp/ mice. the reductionism approach using anthrax LT treatments was shown to induce TNF--independent hypoxia-mediated toxicity and mortality in mice. pathogenesis of real anthrax infection is a complex disease involving more virulence factors such as edema toxin and the capsule components. sP-sel treatments also markedly reduced the mortality of anthrax spore\u2013challenged mice. anti-inflammation effect may also be involved in sP-sel-mediated rescue. elicitation of sP-sel is potentially a self-rescue physiology in response to anthrax infection. compared with coagulation-suppressive drugs, coagulation-enhancing agents have rarely been developed. 62,63 polyclonal anti-P-sel Igs were obtained from recombinant P-sel-IgG-Fc fusion protein (P-sel-Fc) immunized rabbits. anti-P-sel antibody and control Igs were purchased from BD PharMingen Taiwan. the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) contamination was monitored using a kit. rabbits were subcutaneously injected with PA (100 mg) adjuvant mixture at 3-wk interval for 6 cycles. the quality of spores was determined by 2 complementary criteria previously established for validating the presence of dormant spores. the criteria consisted of evaluating (i) the absence of vegetative cells (rods) determined through microscopic examination as described. the mice were examined every 12 h for up to 7 d. no additional death was observed 7 d after the LT treatments. all surviving mice were monitored every day for 2 mo. mice were administered a single intravenous injection of Evans blue dye 30 min before a lethal dose challenge of LT. mice were killed and tissue samples were collected and minced before incubation with formamide\u2013water (1:1) for 48 h at 37 \u00b0C. plasma recalcification clotting time was measured as described previously. the mouse plasma was collected 72 h after the P-sel-Fc (1.2 mg/kg) 20 and LT treatments (4.5 mg/kg) 13 treatments of isotype control Ig (1.2 mg/kg) and PA (4.5 mg/kg) were used as control groups. the liver function was analyzed through detecting circulating aspartate aminotransferase levels. de buffer (137 mM NaCl;
