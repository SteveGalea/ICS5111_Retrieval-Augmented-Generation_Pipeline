{"summary": "PIV5 F is a type I transmembrane GP with a 19-residue signal sequence, a large (465-residue) ectodomain, a large (465-residue) ectodomain and a short cytoplasmic tail. the protein is synthesized as a precursor (F0) that must be cleaved for F to be biologically active. biochemical and structural characterization of PIV5 F-GCNt. the major F-GCNt domains are highlighted by color. the gel indicates the completeness of protease cleavage. CNt domain was omitted from the model because of insufficient electron density. exogenous trypsin was used to cleave F-GCNt to allow temporal control and optimization of the cleavage protocol. cleaved prefusion PIV5 F-GCNt crystallized in the space group C2. each monomer consists of four domains\u2014DI, DII, DIII, and HRB regions. the three monomers are highly interconnected, and together DI, DII, and DIII form a globular head. HRB forms a trimeric coiled-coil stalk. Arg-98 to -100 and -103 to -105 are deleted from the construct. however, in each case, the Rfree value increased when these residues were separately deleted from the final model. the model differs slightly near the cleavage sites for each chain. the carbonyl carbon of F103 forms an intramolecular hydrogen bond with the nitrogen of G105, possibly shared with the nitrogen of V106. the carbonyl carbon of F103 packs against the globular structure, making hydrophobic contact with P96, V107, V125, V128, and K129. the calculated surface electrostatic values of PIV5 F-GCNt reveals several interesting features. the stalk domain is almost entirely negatively charged. another large negative patch lies at the boundary where the FP interacts with the HRC helix. electrostatic solvent-accessible surfaces were calculated at a salt concentration of 0.15 M using the Adaptive Poisson\u2013Bolzmann Solver and PDB2PQR software. electrostatic potential ranges from 2 (red) to +2 (blue) kT/e. residues 1\u201310 of the newly formed N terminus of HA2 bind in a nearby cavity and project into the interior of the trimer. interactions between the core structure and residues in the cleavage loop may reduce the accessibility of proteases and limit virus pathogenicity. the entire fusion loop of Ebola virus GP FP is highlighted in orange. color-coding is as in B, except the entire FP is colored orange. the cleavage site of PIV5 (W3A) lies in a surface loop at the junction between the HRC and the FP. the FP of PIV5 F-GCNt is already mostly buried in the prefusion uncleaved structure. the crystal structure of GP in its furin-cleaved (GP1/GP2) prefusion form was solved in complex with a neutralizing antibody (27) unlike paramyxovirus F and influenza HA, the hydrophobic FP resides in an internal fusion loop rather than at the N- terminus of GP2 following furin cleavage. PIV5 F is a type I transmembrane GP with a 19-residue signal sequence, a large (465-residue) ectodomain, a large (465-residue) ectodomain and a short cytoplasmic tail. cleavage occurs intracellularly in the trans Golgi network by furin or a furin-like protease. the major F-GCNt domains are highlighted by color. the gel indicates the completeness of protease cleavage and purity of protein used for crystallization trials. exogenous trypsin was used to cleave F-GCNt to allow temporal control and optimization of the cleavage protocol. cleaved prefusion PIV5 F-GCNt crystallized in the space group C2 and diffracted X-rays anisotropically up to 2.0\u20133.0 resolution. each monomer consists of four domains\u2014DI, DII, DIII, and HRB regions. the three monomers are highly interconnected, and together DI, DII, and DIII form a globular head. HRB forms a trimeric coiled-coil stalk (Fig. 1 E and F) s immediately adjacent to the cleavage site (Arg-98 to -100 and -103 to -105; Arg-101 and -102 are deleted from the construct) however, in each case, the Rfree value increased when these residues were separately deleted from the final model. the model differs slightly near the cleavage sites for each chain. the carbonyl carbon of F103 forms an intramolecular hydrogen bond with the nitrogen of G105, possibly shared with the nitrogen of V106. the carbonyl carbon of F103 packs against the globular structure, making hydrophobic contact with P96, V107, V125, V128, and K129. the calculated surface electrostatic values of PIV5 F-GCNt reveals several interesting features. the stalk domain is almost entirely negatively charged. another large negative patch lies at the boundary where the FP interacts with the HRC helix. electrostatic solvent-accessible surfaces were calculated at a salt concentration of 0.15 M. electrostatic potential ranges from 2 (red) to +2 (blue) kT/e. HA and GP have many similarities to the F protein of paramyxoviruses. residues 1\u201310 of the newly formed N terminus of HA2 bind in a nearby cavity. protonation of these buried residues is thought to help destabilize the prefusion structure. interactions between the core structure and residues in the cleavage loop may reduce accessibility of proteases. the entire fusion loop of Ebola virus is highlighted in orange. FP residue sidechains are shown as sticks. color-coding is as in B, except the entire FP is colored orange. ed movement of the N- and C-termini after cleavage, no burying of exposed hydrophobic residues of the FP, and no setting of a pH-sensitive trigger. the crystal structure of Ebola virus GP in its furin-cleaved (GP1/GP2) prefusion form was solved in complex with a neutralizing antibody (27) unlike paramyxovirus F and influenza HA, the hydrophobic FP resides in an internal fusion loop cleaved prefusion structures of PIV5 F, influenza HA, and Ebola virus GP exhibit different paradigms of cleavage activation for type I fusion proteins. for influenza HA, the details of the structure help explain how the length of the cleavage loop is a determinant of pathogenicity. uncleaved hPIV3 F protein lacked a GCNt trimerization domain. it folded directly into a postfusion conformation even in the absence of protease cleavage. the changes occurring on protease cleavage of F are not benign. -477 (with two Arg residues in the protease recognition sequence deleted to prevent intracellular cleavage) fused to the GCNt trimerization domain was subcloned into pBACgus-11. the factor Xa cleavage site between the GCNt domain and the His tag was replaced with a single Ala residue. the optimized crystals were grown at 20 \u00b0C by the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method. the crystals were harvested and transferred to the precipitant plus 20% glycerol for flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen. three monomers were found in the asymmetric unit (rotation function z-score = 46.7, translation function z-score = 80.8, log-likelihood gain = 8,781) Molecular replacement with postfusion F models was not successful. a recombinant baculovirus that expresses F-GCNt was generated using the BacVector-2000 Transfection Kit (Novagen) high five cells (Invitrogen) were infected at a multiplicity of infection of five plaque-forming units. a native dataset was collected at the Life Sciences Collaborative Access Team beamline at the Argonne National Laboratory Advanced Photon Source. the data were processed to 2.0 using the HKL-2000 program package (HKL Research) but because of anisotropy, the data were submitted to the UCLA Molecular Biology Institute\u2019s Diffraction Anisotropy Server. model building, structure refinement, and validation were performed with coot (41), PHENIX Refine (42) and MolProbity (43). the use of translation, libration, screw motion (TLS) parameters and individual B-factor restraints during late stages of refinement helped lower the Rfree value."}
