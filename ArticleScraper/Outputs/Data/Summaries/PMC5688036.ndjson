{"summary": "a digital syndromic surveillance system can overcome the limitation of time-delay in traditional surveillance systems. a syndromic surveillance system should use real-time or near-real-time data, i.e., school or work absenteeism, over the counter medication. traditional surveillance systems mainly depend on case reports, such as influenza-like illness (ILI) reports. in korea, there is a national health alert system which uses data from social media and blogs. this prediction method could be the core engine for implementing a (near-) real-time digital surveillance system. search queries and social media data are generated by laypersons. for influenza prediction, we conducted a survey by quota sampling based on sex and age. we also included keywords that were chosen by physicians, such as fever, cough, and sore throat for influenza prediction. the downloaded CSV file consists of two columns. the first column represents the week by indicating the starting date of the week. the second column is the trend data. the number of tweets containing one of the predefined keywords was collected through Topsy. however, there is currently a barrier to using Twitter data. data analysis Spearman correlation analyses can be used to examine correlations between search engine data and disease data. data collection To implement a prediction model for the digital surveillance system, the statistics of an infectious disease and digital data should be collected. disease statistics are used as target data and digital data is used as input for the prediction model. the chosen keywords for influenza and MERS were translated into English or Korean. aOnly Korean keyword was used, bonly English keywords were used. there is a timedelay pattern between the influenza statistics and Google Trends data. Virological and ILI data were extracted manually from ILI reports. the trend data of representative keywords were extracted from Google Trends. the ratio of ILI in week 28 was 6.0. Figure 1 shows an example ILI report published by the KCDC. the ratio of ILI in week 28 was 6.0. the chosen keywords for influenza and MERS were translated into English or Korean. aOnly Korean keyword was used, bonly English keywords were used. Virological and ILI data were extracted manually from ILI reports. trend data obtained from Google Trends or Naver DataLab are available as normalized values. data analysis Spearman correlation analyses can be used to examine the correlations between search engine data and disease data. the data must be arranged in rows so that each row represents a specific time period. the data must be arranged in rows so that each row represents a specific time period. the proposed digital surveillance system should be used with caution or as a complementary method."}
