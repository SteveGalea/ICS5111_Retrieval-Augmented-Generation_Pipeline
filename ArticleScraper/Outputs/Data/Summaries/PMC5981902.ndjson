{"summary": "zoonoses, or diseases of animal origin, are defined as diseases transmitted between animals and humans as a consequence of a direct contact or indirect environmental contact. among recognised pathogens causing human diseases, almost 60% are of animal origin. they cause such diseases as toxoplasmosis, anthrax, rabies, Ebola haemorrhagic fever, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and primary HIV infection. in the u.s., the number of food poisonings may reach as high as 48 million cases a year, with salmonellosis and campylobacteriosis affecting as many as 2 million people a year. in the u.s., the number of food poisonings may reach as high as 48 million cases a year, with salmonellosis and campylobacteriosis alone affecting as many as 2 million people a year. campylobacter spp. are small (0.2\u20130.9 m wide and 0.2\u20135.0 m long), spirally curved, Gram-negative rods that do not form spores. they move in a way that resembles a corkscrew. this movement is possible due to a single, polar flagellum. in the u.s., campylobacteriosis affects a million people a year. in the united states, campylobacteriosis affects a million people a year. in the u.s., campylobacteriosis affects a million people a year. drug resistance - increasing antibiotic resistance resulting from misuse of antibiotics in medicine, veterinary medicine, and agriculture 2. resistance to fluoroquinolons (e.g., ciprofloxacin), macrolides (e.g., erythromycin), aminoglicosides (e.g., gentamycin, canamycin and streptomycin), tetracyclines, and -lactames. cdtB encodes the enzymatic part of the toxin 2; cdtA encodes subunits responsible for binding the toxin to the membrane of an eukaryotic cell 2; - halting the eukaryotic cell during the G2/M phase of the cellular cycle. not all strains produce CDT 2; - not all strains produce CDT 2. 104 bacteria are considered the optimum infective dose. symptoms range from watery diarrhea to bloody stool, with fever, abdominal pain, vomiting, and dehydration. campylobacteriosis is most often caused by the consumption of poultry. campylobacter spp. colonise the mucosa of the caecum and cloaca crypts of infected chickens. the bacterial count per 1 gram of chicken faeces may reach the level of 1010, causing no infection and leading to no changes in caecal mucosa. in newborn chickens before 3rd week of life, no presence of Campylobacter is found. there are no studies on Campylobacter infections in small ruminants. there are some data regarding pathogens isolated from sheep carcasses and from lamb available in retail markets. raw milk is most often cross-infected with Campylobacter spp. during milking or as result of udder infection. despite a high ratio of C. coli infected pigs in slaughterhouses, the pathogen is rarely isolated from porcine carcasses. the source of campylobacteriosis may be bone pork (e.g., loin) and offal (the liver, heart, kidneys, and guts) salmonella spp. can grow at temperatures ranging between 8 and 45 \u00b0C (optimum temperature 37 \u00b0C), at the pH of the environment from 4.0 to 9.5 (optimum pH 6.5\u20137.0) pathogenic salmonella spp. can move using the peritrichal flagellum. the S. bongori species involves serotypes belonging to subspecies V, and other subspecies, including I, II, IIIa, IIIb, IV, and VI, belong to the S. enterica species. most serotypes are classified as S. enterica subsp. enterica (subspecies I) and they are responsible for 99% of salmonellosis cases in humans. over a million cases of salmonellosis a year are estimated in the united states. virulence of pathogenic Salmonella spp. is associated both with chromosomal and plasmid genes. the pathogenicity of Salmonella spp. depends on the serotype and the host\u2019s immunity. pathogenic bacteria belong to the Salmonella genus cause three types of salmonellosis in humans. noninvasive and nontyphoid, invasive and nontyphoid, and typhoid fever caused by the serotype S. paratyphi. the world incidence may reach as high as 21 million a year, with over 200,000 fatal cases. the highest number of cases of typhoid fever is noted in africa and in Southeast and Central Asia [73,106]. infection with nontyphoid serotypes of Salmonella spp. lasts no longer than 7 days. symptoms include vomiting, nausea, fever, shivers, muscular or articular pain, cramps and loss of appetite. nontyphoid salmonellosis does not require hospitalisation, and only fluid therapy is necessary. salmonella spp. serotypes most often isolated from animal reservoirs in europe. underlined serovar was the one isolated most frequently. Salmonella spp. may be present in as much as 65% of individuals in a flock. intestines of poultry, especially of chicken and turkeys, are asymptomatically colonised by its flock. salmonella spp. may also be transferred to the liver, spleen, and ovaries. many strains isolated from poultry demonstrate resistance to selected antibiotics. infected birds are the primary source of Salmonella spp. infection in the production environment. salmonella spp. is also increasingly present in cattle, both bred for meat and for milk. yersiniosis There are 17 species in the Yersinia genus belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family. Y. enterocolitica are Gram-negative, relatively anaerobic, catalase-positive, nonsporulating, and absolutely psychrophilic enteropathogens. y. enterocolitica are able to survive in the VNBC condition and proliferate and produce a thermostable toxin in cooling conditions (4\u20138 \u00b0C) the highest incidence of yersiniosis in Europe is caused by the bacteria belonging to biotype 4. biotype 1A is common in the environment, and considering the absence of the majority of virulence markers (chromosomal and plasmid pYV), it is considered nonpathogenic. secretion system type III encoded by genes localised on the pYV plasmid, expression at 37 \u00b0C with low concentration of calcium ions. gene may be expressed at 37 \u00b0C. enterotoxin Yst - a protein encoded by the chromosomal gene yst - affects adhesion and invasion of pathogens into host\u2019s cells. ystB gene encoding heat resistant YstB toxin may be secreted at 37 \u00b0C. yersiniosis affects all humans, but children under 5 years, people with reduced immunity, and the elderly are more at risk. the disease is manifested by fever, stomach ache, and diarrhea (often bloody) sis affects nearly 117,000 people a year in the united states, including 640 cases requiring hospitalisation and 35 resulting in death. in the u.s., a decreasing tendency of confirmed cases of yersiniosis has been observed between 2005 and 2016. in the u.s., a decreasing tendency of confirmed cases of yersiniosis has been observed between 2005 and 2016. bacteria are Gram-positive, relatively anaerobic, oxidase-negative, and catalase-positive organisms. they are mobile in temperatures ranging between 22 and 30 \u00b0C, but at 37 \u00b0C they do not form a flagellum [183,184]. monocytogenes were identified (1/2a, 1/2b, 1/2c, 3a, 3b, 3b, 3c, 4a, 4b, 4c, 4d, 4e, 4ab, and 7) each serotype differs in terms of the antigenic determinants located on the cellular surface. four evolution lineages are also classified (I, II, III, and IV) the most important role is played by internalin A (InlA) and internalin B (InlB) they allow production of a biofilm; - InlA\u2014binding to E-cadherin receptors on the surface of host cells. listriolysin O - a toxin encoded by the hly gene localised on the Listeria pathogenicity island 1 (LPI-1); infections associated with L. monocytogenes are characterised by a long incubation period ranging between 1 and as many as 70 days. a different incubation time is also noted in individuals with the symptoms of bacteraemia (1\u2013. the exact dose of L. monocytogenes is not defined because it depends on the susceptibility of the host organism and the virulence of a particular strain. symptoms may appear within 24 h and in otherwise healthy adults they may be: articular pain, headache and stomach ache, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, lack of appetite, weariness, and somnolence. in neonates, infection may lead to sepsis, pneumonia, or meningitis. 99% of the cases of listeriosis are associated with contaminated food. pathogenic strains of those bacteria may also colonise domestic animals. ruminants may also be prone to miscarriage or enterogastritis. in both cases, animals disseminate bacteria in the environment with faeces. in both cases, animals disseminate bacteria in the environment with faeces. that may account for infection of other animals in the herd, as well as of animals in other herds using same pasture. there are no data on the frequency of occurrence of pathogens in poultry and meat obtained from them. the best solution to limit the incidence of zoonoses in humans is to control and prevent dissemination of pathogens in animals constituting the main reservoir of the infections."}
