{"summary": "in 2006, two live attenuated RV vaccines, RotaTeq and Rotarix, were introduced to the market and are now licensed for use worldwide. the vaccines are both safe and effective at preventing RV-associated disease and mortality. the virus exhibits host-range restricted replication. the innate immune response is initiated by host proteins called pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that sense pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) presented during the microbial infection. the innate immune response is characterized by the production of type I interferons (IFN-/) and many other pro-inflammatory cytokines. ligands found to activate RIG-I include uncapped 5\u2019-triphosphorylated (5\u2019 ppp) ssRNA [12,13,14,15], 5\u2019 ppp ssRNA containing polyuridine or polyadenine stretches [16,17], 5\u2019 ppp base-paired RNAs [18,19], short dsRNA [20,21], and 3\u2019-monophosphorylated RNA [22]. RV infection induces an early IFN response, but in most cases the virus rapidly suppresses IFN signaling through the actions of viral proteins such as NSP1 [37,38,39,40,41,42,43]. RV infection of murine embryonic fibroblasts induces a MAVS-dependent early antiviral transcriptional response that involves both RIG-I and MDA5 [46] RV transcription produces uncapped RNAs with exposed 5\u2019 phosphate groups and RNAs with incompletely 2\u2019-O-methylated 5\u2019 cap structures. these two RNA signatures provide molecular basis for how RV induces RLR-dependent innate immune signaling. DLPs contain the complete dsRNA genome, have a functional RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) and can efficiently generate capped and methylated transcripts when supplemented with nucleotides (NTPs), S-adenosylmethionine, and magnesium ions. the first question we asked was what types of RNAs are generated in IVT reactions. complete and incomplete IVT reactions were carried out as described in the methods. total RNA was purified from the reactions and applied to a denaturing urea-acrylamide gel. UV shadowing was used to visualize large and small molecular weight (MW) RNAs. molecular weight (MW) RNAs were visible beginning at the bottom of the well. the large MW smear was not visible in the incomplete IVT reaction lane. a small MW smear at the bottom of the gel was excised from the complete and incomplete IVT lane. large and small MW RNA fraction purified from the complete IVT reaction was a potent IFN activator. small MW RNA fraction purified from the complete IVT reaction was much less stimulatory than the large MW RNA fraction purified from the complete IVT reaction. this result suggests that although input genomic dsRNA is immunostimulatory, nascent transcripts are also capable of inducing IFN signaling. dsRNA staining was clearly detectable in the cytoplasm of polyI:C-transfected cells. on the other hand, no RV-associated dsRNA staining was observed at this time-point in RV-infected cells. we also examined infected cells at 8 hours post-infection. newly synthesized viral dsRNA was unlikely to be the major immunostimulatory RNA produced during RV infection. the data from the IVT reactions (Figure 1) suggested that newly synthesized viral dsRNA was unlikely to be the major immunostimulatory RNA produced during RV infection. dsRNA was infected with RRV at an estimated MOI of 5 for 1 or 6 hours (hr) the large RNA fraction isolated from MA104 cells infected with RV for 6 hours, but not 1 hour, was highly immunostimulatory. this results indicate that the amount of RV genomic dsRNA present in the input inoculum is not sufficient to induce IFN. the next step of our study was to characterize the role of the RLRs in downstream innate immune signaling from the in vitro and in vivo-generated RNA samples. in vitro ssRNA and in vivo 6 hr large RNA samples were potent inducers of IFN-beta production. in vivo 1 hr large RNA sample was minimally stimulatory. IFN-beta responses to in vitro ssRNA and in vivo 6 hr large RNA samples were completely abrogated in the absence of RIG-I. in vitro ssRNA, in vivo 6 hr large RNAs, in vivo 1 hr large RNAs, or polyI:C. mouse IFN-beta ELISA was used to measure the concentration of secreted IFN-beta protein in the cell media. bars show the average IFN-beta concentration plus standard deviation. enzymatic characterization of RV in vitro and in vivo immunostimulatory RNAs. 2\u2019-O-methyltransferase (2\u2019OMT), antarctic phosphatase (2\u2019OMT) and 5\u2019 capping reactions were set up. enzymatic reactions were carried out with the in vivo 6 hr large RNA sample as in A. RNAs were purified and WT MEFs were transfected with 500 ng/well of polyI:C as negative and positive controls. bars show the average IFN-beta concentration plus standard deviation. dsRNA genome segments, either from input or replicating virus, are present in any substantial amount as free molecules in the cytoplasm of infected cells. we hypothesized that RV ssRNA transcripts, and not genomic dsRNA, would likely be the primary immunostimulatory molecules generated during infection. RNA products from each reaction were analyzed on a denaturing 20% urea-acrylamide gel. nascent transcripts as well as short oligos were generated in the complete IVT reaction. no RNA products were detected in the IVT reaction lacking RV DLPs. luciferase light unit values were divided by the Renilla light units. bars show the average relative luc values plus standard deviation. complete and incomplete IVT reactions were carried out under similar conditions but in the absence of -32P-GTP. no RNAs were detected in the middle of the gel in either lane. the large MW region at the top of the gel was excised from the complete and incomplete IVT lanes. the small MW smears from the bottom of the gel were excised from both the complete and incomplete IVT lanes. dsRNA is immunostimulatory, nascent transcripts are also capable of eliciting a robust IFN response. lack of detectable dsRNA in and isolation of immunostimulatory RNAs from RV-infected cells. a second approach, we wanted to determine whether naked dsRNA can be detected early in infection. DAPI was used to stain cell nuclei (blue) wild type murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were mock-transfected or transfected with 500 ng/well of in vivo 6 hr large RNAs, in vivo 1 hr large RNAs, or polyI:C. bars show the average IFN-beta concentration plus standard deviation. we used 2.5 M lithium chloride (LiCl) to precipitate RNAs over 100 nucleotides. a large RNA fraction (termed in vivo large RNAs) was transfected into wild type murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) the large RNA fraction isolated from MA104 cells infected with RV for 6 hours, but not 1 hour, was highly immunostimulatory. in vitro ssRNA and in vivo large RNA samples were potent inducers of IFN-beta production. the in vitro ssRNA and in vivo 6 hr large RNA samples were completely abrogated in the absence of RIG-I. the responses to the in vitro ssRNA and in vivo 6 hr large RNA samples were only reduced by approximately 50% in the absence of MDA5. the mitochondrial adaptor protein MAVS was absolutely necessary for IFN-beta induction in response to both the in vitro ssRNA and in vivo 6 hr large RNA samples. the mitochondrial adaptor protein was absolutely necessary for IFN-beta induction by polyI:C. RV transcripts possess a type I 5\u2019 cap structure, m7GpppGm. some of the mRNAs extruded into the cytoplasm may have exposed 5\u2019 phosphates, a known RIG-I ligand. if capping by VP3 is not 100% efficient, some may contain incompletely 2\u2019-O-methylated 5\u2019 caps. treatment of the in vitro ssRNA sample with either antarctic phosphatase or capping enzyme significantly reduced its IFN stimulatory potential. results suggest that the in vitro ssRNA sample contains some uncapped mRNAs with exposed 5\u2019 phosphates, but that the capped mRNAs that are produced appear to be fully methylated. in vitro-transcription approach, we demonstrated that nascent RV ssRNA transcripts have IFN stimulatory potential, suggesting that they possess at least one PAMP. nascent RV ssRNA transcripts generated both in vitro with purified RV DLPs and in vivo in RV-infected cells contain immunostimulatory PAMPs. RV infection produces RNA PAMPs that trigger an innate immune signaling cascade through the RLRs. it is possible that some newly synthesized RV genomic dsRNA could have been present in our in vivo 6 hr large RNA sample. this process takes place in protein-rich viroplasm structures which have been shown to protect viral RNAs from RNAi degradation. eukaryotes, newly transcribed RNAs initially contain a 5\u2019 triphosphorylated end. during subsequent processing of most cellular transcripts the exposed 5\u2019 triphosphate ends are converted to a monophosphate or a guanine cap. the 5\u2019 cap structure is one way host cells discriminate self from non-self RNA. a west Nile virus mutant lacking 2\u2019-O-methyltransferase activity was attenuated in wild type cells. but pathogenic in cells with a defective IFN signaling pathway. this prevented sequestration by IFIT proteins, which act downstream of IFN production as regulators of protein translation. RV has been shown to suppress IFN induction by targeting the transcription factors IRF3/5/7 for degradation through non-structural protein 1 (NSP1) in some strains, RV NSP1 was found to also target -TrCP for degradation, thereby shutting off the NF-B pathway. in other studies, RV has been shown to directly interfere with STAT1 activation [62], suggesting another potential mechanism by which RV can antagonize this pathway. in vivo studies in a mouse model of RV infection showed age-dependent TLR3 expression within the intestinal epithelium may be implicated in susceptibility to RV infection. future work will be needed to determine if additional molecular patterns are produced at different time-points during RV infection. pIFN-beta-luc (firefly luciferase) plasmid was a gift from jae U.
