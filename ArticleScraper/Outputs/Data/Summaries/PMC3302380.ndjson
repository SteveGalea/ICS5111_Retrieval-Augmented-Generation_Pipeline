{"summary": "extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) is the effector kinase of a central cellular signaling pathway regulating cell death and survival, proliferation, and differentiation and cellular migration and motility. it belongs to the class of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), which also includes c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and the p38 MAP kinases. poxviruses from most genera have been shown to express a secreted growth factor similar to mammalian EGF. the vaccinia virus growth factor (4, 5) represents the best-studied example. the advantage for poxviruses in directing the expression was long seen as providing a metabolically active cellular environment supporting viral replication. MVA was generated by subjecting the parental CVA to over 570 passages in chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) over the course of the passages, six major deletions of 2.7 to 6.5 kbp and a large number of smaller deletions, insertions, and point mutations occurred in the genome. all cell lines were obtained from ATCC or the European Collection of Cell Cultures. primary CEF cells were prepared from 11-day-old embryonated chicken eggs. primary CEF cells were cultured in VP-SFM (Gibco) for virus stock production. the BAC cassette was inserted between the MVA and CVA orthologues, respectively, of genes I3L and I4L. the deletions preserved at least 40 nucleotides of the 3\u2032 end of the O1L ORF. in vitro replication behavior, in vivo virulence, ERK1/2 activation, cytopathic effect (CPE) phenotype, and plaque size reduction were obtained with both the CVA-O1L variant still containing the E. coli kanamycin cassette in place of the O1L gene and the CVA-O1L variant with the traceless deletion of the O1L gene. however, we did not specify the marker variants in the experiments shown. long MVA version of the BAC-derived MVA was noted in both MVA+O1L and the BAC-derived MVA wild type. this mutation shortened the C6L ORF of our BAC-derived MVA clones from 156 to 154 amino acids, with amino acid 154 changed from Phe to Ser. the MVA version of C6L has six additional amino acids at the C terminus compared to the 150-aa version of C6L from CVA and all RNA was eluted from the RNeasy spin columns with 30 l of RNase-free water. the remaining viral and cellular DNA in the sample was digested with Turbo DNase (Ambion/Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany) the samples were incubated with the DNase for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. qPCRs were performed on an ABI 7500 96-well real-time PCR machine. reaction mixtures were subjected to 40 cycles of incubation for 15 s at 95\u00b0C and 1 min at 60\u00b0C. fold induction of viral gene expression was calculated relative to undetectable signals in mock-infected cells. 500 l of the total of 1 ml of DMEM\u201310% FCS culture medium per well was aspirated and virus dilutions in DMEM were directly added at a volume of 100 l into the culture supernatants. cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing P8340 protease inhibitor cocktail. cells were lysed for 10 min in ice-cold radio lysates in 1 Laemmli loading buffer were thawed and then heated for 5 min at 95\u00b0C. membranes were blocked using 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; pH 7.5) containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 0.1% NaN3. the polyclonal rabbit anti-B5 antibody was a generous gift of R. Drillien, Strasbourg, France. it was produced by immunization of rabbits with a peptide derived from CVA-B15. human epidermal growth factor (hEGF; 10 M) was purchased from PeproTech. cells were either mock infected or infected with MVAs or CVAs. SN were incubated with uninfected CV-1 cells for 24 h. dilutions calculated to result in 10 to 50 single plaques per well. cells were washed with cell culture medium without FCS. medium was changed to semisolid overlay medium (DMEM, 7% FCS, 0.5% methyl cellulose) 500 l of DMEM without FCS were washed once with DMEM. cells were kept on ice after 60 min of adsorption at 37\u00b0C. t = 0 h time point, cells were washed with ice-cold DMEM. mice were anesthetized by ketamine-xylazine injection prior to intranasal infection with 3 105, 1 106, and 1 107 TCID50 of CVA and CVA mutants diluted in PBS to a final volume of 50 l per mouse. the signs of illness were scored on an arbitrary scale from 0 to 4. the BAC cassette contains miniF plasmid sequences derived from pMBO131 (38) for maintenance in Escherichia coli and a neomycin-phosphotransferase II-EGFP marker cassette. the BAC cassette was inserted between the MVA and CVA orthologues. two independent CVA-BAC constructs with a deletion of the O1L gene were generated. the deletions preserved at least 40 nucleotides of the 3\u2032 end of the O1L gene to maintain the E11L promoter and correct amino acid terminus. rpsL/neo cassette was subsequently deleted by allelic exchange mutagenesis. both MVA O1L fragments from 39 bp downstream of full-length O1L start codon to 67 bp downstream of full-length stop codon were replaced with an rpsL/neo counterselection cassette. a PCR fragment comprising the start and stop codons of the CVA O1L ORF flanked by 30 and 46 bp, respectively, of MVA-specific nucleotides was produced. BAC-derived MVA with the 154-aa C6L version and MVA-BN (trademark of Bavarian Nordic) possessing the bona fide MVA version of C6L with 156 amino acids both showed the typical weak-to-absent ERK1/2 phosphorylation pattern. this confirmed that the 2-aa-shorter C6L of the BAC-derived MVA did not influence the parameters determined in this study. for reactivation of infectious virus, a 1-l volume of RT reaction mixture was added to 20 l of the total PCR mixture for real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) master qPCR mixtures and the following primers were used to set up the qPCRs in duplicate per sample. qPCRs were performed on an ABI 7500 96-well real-time PCR machine. results were analyzed using a software version 2.0.1. cells were seeded the day before infection in 12-well tissue culture plates. cells were lysed for 10 min in ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer. cells were centrifuged for 5 min to remove cell debris. lysates were stored at 20\u00b0C for immunoblot analysis. membranes were blocked using 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in Tris-buffered saline (TBS; pH 7.5) containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 0.1% NaN3. primary antibodies were diluted in 5% BSA\u2013TBS\u2013Tween 20\u20130.1% NaN3. phospho-p38 (p-Thr 180/p-Tyr 182; 1:1,000) phospho-c-Raf (p-Ser-338; 1:1,000) and human EGFR (1:1,000) the polyclonal rabbit anti-B5 antibody was a generous gift of R. Drillien, Strasbourg, France. SN was incubated with uninfected cells for 24 h and analyzed by flow cytometry. cells were seeded the day before infection in 6-well tissue culture plates. cells were then infected at 37\u00b0C with virus dilutions calculated to result in 10 to 50 single plaques per well. stained monolayers were scanned on an Epson Perfection V700 photo scanner. plaque areas were measured using the scanned monolayers and computer software developed at Bavarian Nordic. plaque sizes and morphologies were analyzed without fixation or staining of cell monolayers. ice-cold DMEM supplemented with 2 ml of ice-cold DMEM\u20132% FCS. titers were determined on CEF cells and CVA titers were determined on CV-1 cells according to the TCID50 method. all animal experiments were approved according to the regulations of the german animal welfare law. RESULTS Virus-specific induction of sustained ERK activation in human cells. a decrease was observed at late times of infection from 8 h until 24 h p.i. treatment of infected 293 cells with cycloheximide inhibiting mRNA translation showed that activation of ERK1/2 at 4 h p.i. was dependent on de novo protein biosynthesis. inhibitors of the p38 (SB203580) and the PI(3)K/Akt (LY294002) pathways did not significantly affect ERK1/2 activation during CVA infection. ERK1/2 activation in uninfected 293 cells was abolished by treatment with the EGFR inhibitor tyrphostin AG1478. ERK1/2 activation in uninfected 293 cells was completely abolished by treatment with the tyrphostin AG1478. infected cells increased strongly over the first 4 h of infection. supernatants from virus-infected cells were analyzed for virus contamination. the supernatants contained an average of 103 TCID50 and a maximum of 4 103 TCID50 of infectious virus. supernatants were collected from 293 cells that had been either mock infected or infected with MVA or CVA at an MOI of 10. after stimulation, cells were directly lysed in 1 Laemmli loading buffer and ERK1/2 phosphorylation (p-ERK1/2) and tubulin expression were analysed by immunoblotting. 293 cells were mock infected with MVA, CVA, or CVA-O1L. cells were lysed after 10 min, 1 h, or 4 h of stimulation. SN and human epidermal growth factor (hEGF) were used to stimulate uninfected 293 cells. lysates were analyzed for ERK1/2 phosphorylation and expression of EGFR and tubulin. 293 cells were mock infected or mock infected for 1 h, 2 h, or 4 h. phosphorylation of FAK, Raf, JNK, ERK1/2, and p38 was analyzed by immunoblotting. only one CVA mutant that lacked the complete O1L ORF (CVA-O1L) showed a clear deficiency in sustained ERK1/2 activation at 4 h p.i. in 293 cells. at most, CVA-O1L did not stimulate sustained ERK1/2 activation between 2 and 8 h p.i. in some experiments. 293 cells were infected with MVA and MVA+O1L at an MOI of 10 or mock infected. levels of IB as well as phosphorylation of ERK1/2 were analyzed by immunoblotting. neither CVA nor CVA-O1L induced a decrease in IB levels. reduced ERK1/2 activation by CVA-O1L was not due to impaired VGF secretion, since supernatants of 293 cells infected for 4 h induced similar kinetics and extents of ERK1/2 activation. CVA-infected 293 cells showed enhanced c-Raf phosphorylation. in CVA-O1L-infected cells, c-Raf was phosphorylated only marginally. this suggests that the target of the O1 protein is located upstream of c-Raf. RT-qPCR between 1 and 2 h p.i. increased over the next 4 to 6 h of infection. the gene was efficiently transcribed in the presence of AraC, whereas transcription of the F17R gene was almost completely suppressed. fold increases of viral transcripts compared to mock-infected cell results at 6 h are shown. RT = reverse transcription reaction without reverse transcriptase enzyme. spread of CVA-O1L in cell culture. monolayers were incubated with liquid overlay medium and analyzed by fluorescence and phase-contrast microscopy at days 3 and 4 p.i. expression of EGFP from the BAC cassette contained in the genomes of all viruses was utilized as a marker of virus-infected cells. plaques formed by CVA showed a zone of a broken cell monolayer at the edges of the plaque. there was still a continuous monolayer at the edges of the plaques formed by CVA-O1L. this phenomenon was most apparent in CV-1 cells. there was less cytopathic effect at the edges of CVA-O1L plaques. lower ERK1/2 activation might affect CVA-O1L replication more significantly in resting cells than in active cells. titers of cell-associated virus from resting 293 cells were also slightly reduced. the difference was not more pronounced in this setting. cells and supernatants of resting 293 cell monolayers were analyzed separately. each data point represents results from three independent wells. infected cells show green fluorescence due to expression of EGFP encoded in BAC cassette present in all recombinant viruses. infected mice presented with slightly later onset (P 0.05) and slightly less severe clinical symptoms at the peak of disease (P 0.01) all mice infected with CVA-O1L survived an infective dose of 1 107 TCID50 whereas, with the exception of one animal, all animals infected with that dose of CVA died. titers in ovaries from CVA-O1L-infected mice were reduced 10- to 100-fold on average compared to levels in ovaries from CVA-O1L-infected mice. at 4 and 6 days p.i., viral titers in ovaries were similar. the shortened intergenic region of MVA still contained a fully functional O1L promoter capable of directing early expression of the full-length O1L ORF. the kinetics of E3L (immediate early), C7L (early) and F17R (late) gene transcription were not significantly different between MVA+O1L-infected and MVA-infected 293 cells. in uninfected 293 cells with graded doses of supernatants induced very similar levels of ERK1/2 activation. expression of full-length O1 restored sustained ERK1/2 activation by MVA. erK2 activation by CVA-O1L in CEF cells was not significantly decreased. AG1478 slightly reduced MVA and MVA+O1L focus size and EGFP expression. CVA plaque size in CEF cells was also not affected by U0126 or the deletion of O1L. this contrasts to the significant impact of AG1478 treatment on CVA plaque size in 293 cells. monolayers of 106 secondary CEF cells were infected in triplicate at an MOI of 10 (single-cycle analysis) (C) or at an MOI of 0.05 (multicycle analysis) (D) of the indicated viruses. the ratio of the viral output 3 day p.i. to the input of 5 104 TCID50 per well is plotted. sustained ERK1/2 phosphorylation in human 293 cells at levels similar to previously described ERK1/2 activation by VACV-WR (1). in contrast, MVA only weakly induced ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 1A) despite similar levels of infection efficiency and EGFP reporter gene expression. 293 cells were mock infected with CVA, MVA, or VACV-WR. infection was stopped 4 h later by adding lysis buffer to cells. both MVA and CVA encode full-length VGF (C11R gene) but the MVA version differs from that of CVA by four amino acids exchanges. ERK1/2 activation in uninfected 293 cells by supernatants from infected 293 cells was abolished by treatment with the EGFR inhibitor tyrphostin AG1478. supernatants from CVA- and MVA-infected cells induce comparable ERK1/2 activation levels. SN were collected from 293 cells that had been either mock infected or infected with MVA or CVA at an MOI of 10. after stimulation, cells were directly lysed in 1 Laemmli loading buffer. SN from cells infected for 4 h and diluted 1:10 or human epidermal growth factor (EGF) were used to restimulate uninfected cells for 10 min before lysis. 293 cells were directly infected with 103 to 108 TCID50 of CVA for 15 min or 4 h. supernatants (SN) from 293 cells were collected 4 h after infection. SN and human epidermal growth factor (hEGF) were used to stimulate uninfected 293 cells for 10 min, 1 h, or 4 h. after stimulation, cells were either mock infected or infected with CVA or CVA-O1L for 4 h. ERK1/2 activation by VGF decreased to low levels similar to those seen after treatment with EGF. lack of sustained ERK1/2 phosphorylation induced by VGF treatment or MVA infection suggested the involvement of a second factor modulating sustained ERK1/2 activation that was expressed by CVA but not by MVA. only one CVA mutant that lacked the complete O1L ORF (CVA-O1L) showed a clear deficiency in sustained ERK1/2 293 cell monolayers in 6-well plates were infected with MVA+O1L. total RNA from infected cells was isolated and used for RT-qPCR analysis. data represent fold increase of viral transcripts compared to mock-infected cells. the indicated volumes of SN were added to uninfected 293 cells grown in 24-well plates in 300 l of DMEM medium. cells were directly lysed in 1 Laemmli loading buffer and phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) and expression of tubulin were analysed by immunoblotting. sustained ERK1/2 phosphorylation induced by CVA and CVA-O1L was dependent on MEK1/2. this argued against a kinase activity of O1 capable of directly phosphorylating ERK1/2. also, the EGFR inhibitor AG1478 blocked activation of ERK1/2 by CVA and residual activation by CVA-O1L. thus, sustained ERK1/2 activation in CVA infection is mediated by continuing EGFR activity FAK was clearly activated by CVA infection, but this activation did not appear to be regulated by O1. alternative MAPK pathways such as the JNK and the p38 pathway were also not significantly affected by O1. this suggests a unique role of the O1 protein in regulation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. 293 cell monolayers in 6-well plates were infected with CVA and CVA-O1L at an MOI of 10 for the indicated times in the absence or presence of AraC. total RNA from cells infected was isolated and used for RT-qPCR quantification of the relative amounts of viral transcripts from genes O1L, E3L, C7L, and F17R. in the presence of U0126, CVA-O1L plaques were still 20% smaller than those produced by CVA. this was also highly statistically significant (P 0.001) this suggests that the reduced plaque size of CVA-O1L on untreated monolayers resulted from reduced ERK1/2 activation. EGFR inhibitor AG1478 reduced CVA plaque size more efficiently than U0126. crystal violet staining was done 4 days after infection of 293 cell monolayers in liquid overlay medium with CVA or CVA-O1L at appropriate dilutions to obtain clearly separate plaques and discernible comets. the morphology of CVA plaques also differed from that of plaques formed by CVA-O1L. CVA-O1L caused an altered CPE and formed smaller plaques. lack of sustained ERK1/2 activation also contributed to efficient plaque formation. replication properties of CVA-O1L in comparison to parental CVA were examined in 293 cells. reductions in CVA-O1L yields were small and were detectable in both multicycle and single-cycle growth curves. we were not able to conclusively distinguish whether slightly reduced replicative capacity or impaired cell-to-cell spread or both accounted for the smaller plaque size of CVA-O1L. c mice were intranasally infected with graded doses of CVA and CVA-O1L. reduced weight loss and disease symptoms were most pronounced at the sublethal dose of 1 106 TCID50/mouse. differences in weight losses and disease scores were statistically significant. groups of five 6- to 8-week-old mice were infected intranasally with a dose of 1 107 TCID50 of CVA or mutant CVA-O1L. viral titers were determined by a standard TCID50 assay using CV-1 cells. the genome contains six major deletions of 24.7 kbp in total and a number of smaller deletions leading to fragmentation or truncation of a number of additional genes. we replaced the two fragments of the O1L ORF in MVA by the full-length CVA version of O1L. the shortened intergenic region of MVA still contained a fully functional O1L promoter capable of directing early expression of the full-length O1L ORF. fected but not MVA-infected cells showed a sustained activation of ERK1/2 that was comparable to ERK1/2 activation in CVA-infected 293, vero, or CV-1 cells. expression of full-length O1 restored sustained ERK1/2 activation by MVA, confirming role of O1 in regulation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. ERK2 activation by CVA-O1L in CEF cells was not significantly decreased compared to activation by CVA. the sizes of the viral foci formed by MVA+O1L and MVA in CEF cell monolayers were also similar. however, U0126 treatment also had no effect on the size of MVA and MVA+O1L foci. cells were pretreated with inhibitors of EGFR tyrosine kinase (AG1478) or MEK1/2 kinase (U0126) or carrier control (DMSO) for 30 min before infection. cells were infected with MVA or MVA+O1L in the presence of inhibitors at appropriate virus dilutions to obtain discernible foci. DISCUSSION Viruses have evolved a multitude of strategies to modulate cellular signaling pathways to create a favorable intracellular environment for optimal viral replication. the VACV protein O1 is able to sustain virus-induced ERK1/2 activation via the EGFR. both the VGF (C11R) and the O1L gene are highly conserved in orthopoxviruses, but also in most other poxvirus genera. this suggests that the O1L gene was acquired early in the evolution of poxviruses, and its conservation throughout evolution suggests that it provides a significant advantage in interactions of all these viruses with their host cells. downstream effectors of ERK2 may have been active by default in these embryonal cells, circumventing the requirement for ERK2 activation. the full-length O1L ORF may have been lost due to lack of positive selection over the more than 570 CEF cell passages. however, overstimulation of the ERK2 pathway might have detrimental effects, as demonstrated by overexpression of VGF by a VACV variant resulting in smaller plaques. ERK1/2 activation was largely independent of the activation status of ERK1/2 in our 293 cells. the proposed stimulatory effect of ERK1/2 activation on NF-B activation was only weakly if at all detectable in our 293 cells. the reasons for these discrepancies from the results of Gedey et al. (18) remain unclear. signals generated by the three-tiered Raf/MEK/ERK signaling module are regulated by a complex network of factors (44) these include internalization and lysosomal degradation of upstream tyrosine kinase receptors such as the EGFR (31, 69), scaffold proteins which organize the spatial arrangement, interaction, and subcellular localization of the components of the signaling module. active ERK itself downmodulates the activity of upstream components such as ERK network could be exploited by O1 to rewire the EGFR/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway for converting transient ERK1/2 activation into sustained activation. only sustained ERK1/2 activation induced by NGF, and not transient activation by EGF, can launch differentiation and neurite outgrowth programs in PC12 pheochromocytoma cells. reduced cell-to-cell spread may at least contribute to reduced plaque size. ERK1/2 activation promotes cell migration and motility. actin-cross-linking protein EPLIN (20), myosin light chain kinase (37), focal adhesion kinase (22) and key actin cytoskeleton regulators rac and RhoA (59) VGF-deleted virus that induced lower levels of ERK1/2 activation was also released at 2- to 3-fold-lower levels into the culture supernatant at 24 h p.i. (43) reduced viral spread and altered CPE without detectable impairment of replication was observed with F11L deletion mutants of VACV-WR (36). this is in agreement with the reported direct RhoA-inhibitory function of F11. mammalian cells might contribute to the safety of MVA and stability of the attenuated phenotype."}
