{"summary": "the central nervous system (CNS) is not immune to alterations that lead to neurological disease, some resulting from acute, persistent or latent viral infections. a viral presence can only be detected in 3 to 30 cases out of 100,000 people every year. between 6000 and 20,000 cases of encephalitis that require hospitalization occur every year in the united states. s, such as human metapneumovirus A1, and orthopneumoviruses, can infect the human airway. infants and children, as well as the elderly represent more vulnerable populations. viruses cause 95% and 40% of all respiratory diseases, respectively. respiratory viruses may enter the CNS through the hematogenous or neuronal retrograde route. in the first, the virus is being invaded by a viral agent. in the latter, a given virus infects neurons in the periphery and uses the axonal transport machinery to gain access to the CNS. enterovirus D68 and enterovirus D68 are sometimes found in the blood. they may also use the olfactory nerve to get access to the brain through the olfactory bulb [35,36,61,62,63], or other peripheral nerves like the trigeminal nerve. these viruses may also use other peripheral nerves like the trigeminal nerve, which is present in the nasal cavity. viral encephalitis may also be difficult to distinguish from a non-viral encephalopathy or from an encephalopathy associated with a systemic viral infection occurring outside the CNS. a long list of viruses may invade the CNS, where they can infect the different resident cells (neuronal as well as glial cells) arthropod-borne flaviviruses such as the west Nile virus (WNV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), chikungunya virus (ZIKV), alphaviruses such as the chikungunya virus (ZIKV), chikungunya virus (ZIKV), enteroviruses (48,88) affect millions of individuals worldwide and are sometimes associated with encephalitis, meningitis and other neurological sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) appears 6\u201310 years after infection. no specific virus has been constantly associated with specific human neurodegenerative disease. long-term neurodegenerative disorders may represent a \u201chit-and-run\u201d type of pathology, since symptoms are triggered by innate immunity associated with glial cell activation. sporadic cases of febrile seizures, encephalitis and encephalopathies (associated with epileptic symptoms) have been described. the human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a highly prevalent human respiratory pathogen with neuroinvasive and neurovirulent potential. both viruses are highly pathogenic zoonotic members of the Henipavirus genus. they are the etiological agents of acute and severe respiratory disease in humans. they are responsible for seasonal epidemics that affect 3 to 5 million humans, among which 500,000 to 1 million cases are lethal each year. influenza A can be associated with encephalitis, Reye\u2019s syndrome, febrile seizure, Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome, acute necrotizing encephalopathy and possibly acute disseminated encephalomyelitis [153,154,155,156,157,158] the virus has also been associated with the risk of developing Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) EV-A71 and D68 causes different types of upper and lower respiratory tract infections, including severe respiratory syndromes. both serotypes have been associated with neurological disorders like acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), myelitis (AFM), meningitis and encephalitis [166,172,173,174,175]. HCoV-229E (previous group 1, now classified as Alphacoronavirus) and HCoV-OC43 (previous group 2, now classified as Betacoronavirus) were known. a total of 8096 probable cases were reported and almost 10% of these resulted in death. human-to-human transmission appears inefficient as it requires extended close contact with an infected individual. a more efficient human-to-human transmission was observed in south Korea, during the 2015 outbreak of MERS-CoV [231,232]. as of October 8, 2019, the world health organization (WHO) reported that MERS-CoV had spread to at least 27 different countries. as of October 8, 2019, 2468 laboratory-confirmed human cases have been identified with 851 being fatal. both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV usually induce more [228,236] severe illnesses, and strike stronger in vulnerable populations. HCoV infections are most of the time restricted to the airways. they may pass through the epithelium barrier and reach the bloodstream or lymph. this was also suggested for other respiratory viruses that can reach the human CNS. HCoV could use the hematogenous route to penetrate into the CNS. HCoV-OC43 is naturally neuroinvasive in both mice and humans. intranasal infections of susceptible mice also indicate that, once it has invaded the CNS, the virus disseminated to several regions of the brain and the brainstem before it eventually reaches the spinal cord. this is clearly the main route of neuroinvasion used by HCoV-OC43. the right panel represents a higher magnification of infected olfactory receptor neurons. bottom panel represents viral dissemination in several regions of the brain. HCoV may infect the ORN, pass through the neuroepithelium and gain access to the olfactory bulb and eventually to other regions of the brain. the presence and persistence of HCoV in human brains was proposed to cause long-term sequelae related to the development or aggravation of chronic neurological diseases. long-term persistence and newly recognized neuropathogenesis could be underestimated. no reports on the presence of the three other coronaviruses that infect humans have been published. HCoV-OC43 has a selective tropism for neurons in which it is able to use axonal transport as a way of neuron-to-neuron propagation [269] in susceptible mice, HCoV-OC43 has a selective tropism for neurons in which it is able to use axonal transport to propagate between neurons or from neurons to glial cells surrounding neurons in the CNS. dic compartmentalized chambers allow fluidic isolation of axons by establishing a volume difference between cell bodies and axonal end (3) compartments. the high fluidic resistance of the microchannels (2) produces a sustained flow that counteracts diffusion. the blue dotted lines are there to separate the three different parts of the microfluidic device. a recombinant HCoV-OC43 harboring a luciferase reporter gene was injected intra-nasally into mice. a recombinant HCoV-OC43 harboring a luciferase reporter gene [292] was injected intra-nasally into mice. images were taken with a CCD camera mounted in a light-tight imaging chamber. the precise and complete etiology of several long-term neurological pathologies still represent a conundrum. it has been suggested that several neurotropic viruses could be involved in MS pathogenesis but that they may do so through similar direct and/or indirect mechanisms. the immune response may participate in the induction or exacerbation of long-term neuropathologies such as MS in genetically or otherwise susceptible individuals. in recombination activation gene knock-out mice, HCoV-OC43-induced encephalitis could be partially mediated by the T-cell response to infection. HCoV-OC43 is important factor in virulence, neuropropagation and neurodegeneration. the viral S and E proteins are important factors of neurovirulence, neuropropagation and neurodegeneration of infected cells. the HE protein is important for the production of infectious HCoV-OC43 and for efficient spreading between neuronal cells. four endemic HCoV strains have been identified as possible etiological agents for pathologies outside the respiratory tract. myocarditis, meningitis, severe diarrhea (and other gastrointestinal problems) and multi-organ failure have been reported. no evidence of association could yet be clearly demonstrated with disease etiology. different strains of HCoV, including SARS-CoV, can infect different myeloid cells to manipulate the innate immunity and to disseminate to other tissues, including the CNS. the second form of any viral spread towards the CNS is through neuronal dissemination, where a given virus infects neurons in the periphery. the olfactory route is clearly the main route of neuroinvasion used by HCoV-OC43 for neuroinvasion in the central nervous system (CNS) the olfactory route is clearly the main route of neuroinvasion used by HCoV-OC43, as well as the early steps of subsequent neuropropagation within the CNS in susceptible mice. however, our data suggest that HCoV-OC43 may also invade the CNS from the external environment through other HCoV may infect the ORN, pass through the neuroepithelium and gain access to the olfactory bulb. blue arrows indicate the direction of viral spreading. a possible association between the presence of ubiquitous human coronaviruses in the triggering or exacerbation of neurological human pathologies has often been suggested over the years. potential short-term Neuropathologies SARS-CoV, HCoV-OC43 and -229E are naturally neuroinvasive and neurotropic in humans and therefore potentially neurovirulent [220,244,245,249,270,271] no reports on the presence of the three other coronaviruses that infect humans in the CNS have been published. axonal transport and neuron-to-neuron or neuron-to-neuronal cells propagation correlate with the exacerbation of neurovirulence. axonal transport can be assembled in the cell body or at different points along the axon. axonal transport can be used to propagate between neurons or from neurons to glial cells surrounding neurons in the CNS. PMNC were infected in cell body portion (1) and viral S glycoprotein (yellow/green) and neuronal marker (MAP2 protein; red) detection was performed on fixed cells at 24 hpi. data are indicative of viral antigens and/or viral particles going from cell body (1) through the axon in the microchannel (2) and then towards the axonal end portion (3). inant HCoV-OC43 harboring a luciferase reporter gene [292] was injected intra-nasally into mice. images were taken with a CCD camera mounted in a light-tight imaging chamber. HCoV-OC43 structural and accessory proteins are important for infection. surviving mice exhibited long-term sequelae associated with decreased activity in an open field test and a reduced hippocampus with neuronal loss in the CA1 and CA3 layers. the precise and complete etiology of several long-term neurological pathologies still represent a conundrum. it has been suggested several neurotropic viruses could be involved in MS pathogenesis but that they may do so through similar direct and/or indirect mechanisms. HCoV-OC43-induced encephalitis could be partially mediated by the T-cell response to infection. this underlines the possibility that long term infection of the CNS by HCoV [245] may participate in the induction of demyelinating MS-like lesions. accessory proteins (ns2 and ns5) produced during infection by HCoV-OC43 play a significant role in virulence and pathogenesis in the mouse CNS. accumulating evidence now indicate that HCoV are neurovirulent in humans. HCoV may persist in the human CNS as it does in mice. different strains of HCoV, including SARS-CoV, can infect different myeloid cells to manipulate the innate immunity and to disseminate to other tissues, including the CNS. a given virus infects neurons in the periphery and uses the machinery of active transport within those cells in order to gain access to the CNS [259,260]. the olfactory route is clearly the main route of neuroinvasion used by HCoV-OC43 for neuroinvasion in the central nervous system (CNS) on the one hand, an apparently innocuous human respiratory pathogen such as the HCoV may reach the CNS by different routes and induce short-term illnesses, such as encephalitis. on the other hand, it may persist in resident cells of the human CNS. in all regions of the brain, neurons are the main target of infection. HCoV may infect the ORN, pass through the neuroepithelium and gain access to the olfactory bulb (OB) and eventually to other regions of the brain. long-term persistence and newly recognized neuropathogenesis could be underestimated. this suggests better surveillance, diagnoses and deepened virus\u2013host interactions studies are warranted. no reports on the presence of the three other coronaviruses that infect humans in the CNS have been published. HCoV-OC43 has a selective tropism for neurons in which it is able to use axonal transport as a way of neuron-to-neuron propagation [269] based on previous data using different mutant recombinant viruses harboring mutation in the S protein [266,268,269] and making use of a luciferase expressing HCoV-OC43 [292,293,294]. PMNC were infected in the cell body portion (1) and viral S glycoprotein (yellow/green) and neuronal marker (MAP2 protein; red) detection was performed on fixed cells at 24 hpi. data are indicative of viral antigens and/or viral particles going from cell body (1) through the axon in the microchannel (2). a recombinant HCoV-OC43 harboring a luciferase reporter gene [292] was injected intra-nasally into mice. a recombinant HCoV-OC43 harboring a luciferase reporter gene [292] was injected intra-nasally into mice. images were taken using the acquisition software Living Image version 4.3.1. HCoV RNA in the human CNS establishes the natural neuroinvasive properties of these respiratory viral agents. it also suggests that they persist in human CNS [245] as they do in human neural cells [297,298] and in the CNS of mice that survive acute encephalitis. surviving mice exhibited long-term sequelae associated with decreased activity in an open field test. the immune response may participate in the induction or exacerbation of long-term neuropathologies such as MS in genetically or otherwise susceptible individuals. recombination activation gene knock-out mice showed that HCoV-OC43-induced encephalitis could be partially mediated by the T-cell response to infection. this underlines the possibility that long term infection of the CNS by HCoV [245] may participate in the induction of demyelinating MS- HCoV-OC43 has a selective tropism for neurons in which it is able to use axonal transport as a way of neuron-to-neuron propagation [269] in susceptible mice, HCoV-OC43 has a selective tropism for neurons in which it is able to use axonal transport as a way of neuron-to-neuron propagation. devices allow fluidic isolation of axons by establishing a volume difference between cell bodies and axonal end (3) compartments. the high fluidic resistance of the microchannels (2) produces a sustained flow that counteracts diffusion. the blue dotted lines are there to separate the three different parts of the microfluidic device. a recombinant HCoV-OC43 harboring a luciferase reporter gene was injected intra-nasally into mice. a recombinant HCoV-OC43 harboring a luciferase reporter gene [292] was injected intra-nasally into mice. images were taken with a CCD camera mounted in a light-tight imaging chamber. gathered data indicating that some of these proteins also play a significant role in viral dissemination [269,296] the presence of HCoV RNA in the human CNS establishes the natural neuroinvasive properties of these respiratory viral agents. it also suggests that they persist in human CNS [245] as they do in human neural cells [297,298] and in the CNS of mice that survive acute encephalitis. the immune response may participate in the induction or exacerbation of long-term neuropathologies such as MS in genetically or otherwise susceptible individuals. in recombination activation gene knock-out mice, HCoV-OC43-induced encephalitis could be partially mediated by the T-cell response to infection. HCoV-OC43 is important for the production of infectious HCoV-OC43. the viral S and E proteins are important factors of neurovirulence, neuropropagation and neurodegeneration of infected cells. this suggests an attenuation of the eventual spread into the CNS of viruses made deficient in fully active HE protein. coyuncu et al. insisted that under the right conditions all viruses can have access to the CNS. a fast and accurate diagnosis would certainly improve prognosis for patients with a suspected CNS infection. a fast and accurate diagnosis would certainly improve prognosis for patients with a suspected CNS infection. viral infections related to diseases that are rare manifestations of an infection represent situations where Koch\u2019s postulates [323] need to be modified. a series of new criteria, adapted from Sir Austin Bradford Hill, for causation [324,325] was elaborated by Giovannoni."}
