{"summary": "a clear example of a perceived danger associated with bats is the theme of the movie Contagion by S. Soderbergh. this addresses the fact that knowledge on these aspects can facilitate rational evaluation and analysis of risks to public health. this should provide scientists and science communicators adequate material to modify the norms shaping the publics' views on bats. the results of this study should help creating integrated educational programmes aimed at protecting bats and their ecosystems. this requires an approach that is able to deliver a mixed message to conciliate issues related to bat conservation and ecosystem protection. we also included a quiz to test the researcher\u2019s knowledge regarding bats and the role of bats as reservoir hosts of pathogens. 23 responses were from researchers who declared they were not working on bats. the survey was performed in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration [9]. responses were analysed in an anonymous manner. logistic regression of the perception of bats as dangerous animals by scientists studying bats. a higher number of asterisks describes a higher level of statistical significance of the associated factor included in the analysis. 0.324 \u20132.140 0.03238 * Working on bat infection \u20130.653 0.232 \u20132.820 0.00480 ** Percentage of research on bats 0.006 0.003 1.656 0.09782 Percentage of laboratory research 0.018 0.006 3.097 0.00196 ** Manipulation of live bats 0.394 0.232 1.702 0.08871. a large proportion of scientists (approximately 40%) declared that bats are presented as a large proportion of scientists disagreed that bats were a reservoir of H5N1. 48.6% to 58.3% of researchers disagreed that bats could be reservoir hosts of viruses such as Ebola, Nipah, and SARS-CoV. the total number of scientists corresponds to the number of scientists manipulating live bats. the total number of scientists (n2 = 365) corresponds to the number of scientists manipulating live bats. global bat populations are declining due to several factors. the most extensively studied bat family was Vespertilionidae, followed by Molossidae (Q5) (S2a Fig), with insects and invertebrates dominating the diet of these bats. the main topics of research were field ecology, including bats in captivity or in the laboratory, and conservation biology. a majority of respondents (70.8%) believe that lay-people perceive bats as dangerous animals. scientists involved in laboratory-orientated research are more likely to share this public perception. those studying ethology, conservation or bat infections are less likely to share the perception that bats are dangerous animals. only 10 respondents in our survey declared that they had consumed bats. opinions were quite diverse and rely on respondents\u2019 views on bat conservation as well as on culinary taste. researchers always used personal protective equipment, especially disposable gloves, safety goggles, safety glasses or face shields when manipulating live bats. similar trend was observed among researchers manipulating samples collected from live bats. estation ranked high on the list of causes responsible for the decline of bat populations appears clearly related to working directly with live bats or samples taken from live bats. high ranking of intensive agriculture is related to a low percentage of laboratory activities, manipulation of samples, and research activities in the field of conservation. the idea of the danger associated with bats is not uniform within the scientific community studying them. more knowledge about bats is positively associated with a positive perspective. improvement in the perception of bats is having a positive impact on efforts towards their conservation. this would also be valid for any programme aimed at protecting wildlife. conflicting views exist on the management of bat populations. scientists consider that environmental modifications by humans are the major factors causing worldwide decline in bat population. this clearly highlights the human role on a worldwide scale and emphasises the need for ecosystem protection in conservation programmes. a large majority of scientists associate the general population as having a negative perception about bats. analysis of factors explaining the cause of the global decline of bats according to responders.
