{"summary": "apoptosis is a highly regulated and genetically programmed cell death process. it is driven through the death receptor-mediated extrinsic pathway. mitochondrial-mediated intrinsic pathway (1\u20133) plays a pivotal role in the programmed cell death of mammalian cells. emodin may be one of the primary chemical components in Rheum palmatum L. that causes hepatic and renal toxicity (29). ethanol extracts of Cassia occidentalis may be one of its main hepatotoxic ingredients. cyclin A (1:1,000; mouse polyclonal; cat. no. 2524T), p53 (1:1,000; mouse polyclonal; cat. no. 2947T), cyclin E (1:1,000; mouse polyclonal; cat. no. 4656T), CDK2 (1:1,000; rabbit polyclonal; cat. no. 2546T), cleaved caspase-3 (1:1,000; rabbit polyclonal; cat. no. 9509T), 100 l of MTT was added into each well and incubated for 4 h. absorbance of the formazan solution was read at 570 nm in a microplate reader. the cells were cultured overnight and then treated with serial concentrations of emodin for 24 h. the apoptotic cells were immediately analyzed by flow cytometry. at least 10,000 cells per sample were acquired to ensure adequate data. the cells were harvested and washed twice with PBS and incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. Western blot analysis HepaRG cells (4.0105 cells/well) were incubated in 6-well plates. cells were treated with different concentrations of emodin (20, 40 and 80 M) for 24 h at 37\u00b0C. after treatment, the cells were collected and fixed with 70% ice-cold ethanol at 4\u00b0C at least for 24 h. they were then stained with PI/RNase A staining buffer solution for 30 min in the dark. Statistical analysis All experiments were performed in triplicates. the results are expressed as mean standard deviation (SD) pase-9 (1:1,000; rabbit polyclonal; cat. no. 9509T), cytochrome c (1:1,000; rabbit polyclonal; cat. no. 4280T) and PARP (1:1,000; rabbit polyclonal; cat. no. 9542T; all were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA, USA. cells were cultured overnight and then treated with serial concentrations of emodin for 24 h. the absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 490 nm by fluorescent plate reader. cells (4.0105 cells/well) were seeded and incubated with different concentrations of emodin for 24 h. after treatment, the cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 min at room temperature. emodin (20, 40 and 80 M) cells were washed twice in PBS. then, they were loaded with DCFH-DA (10 M) and incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. oxidation-induced increase in DCF fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry. cells were harvested, lysed with RIPA buffer for 30 min on ice. total protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay kit. cytosolic and mitochondrial extracts were prepared using the ProteoExtract\u00ae Cytosol/Mitochondria Fractionation Kit (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) stock concentration of 40 mM was stored at 4\u00b0C. the cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) fetal bovine serum (FBS), antibiotics (100 U/ml penicillin and 100 g/ml streptomycin) cell viability was measured using the MTT assay. cells were seeded in 96-well microplates (5103 cells/well) and incubated at 37\u00b0C overnight. Annexin V/PI staining was used to confirm the emodin-induced apoptosis in HepaRG cells. cells were seeded in 6-well plates and treated with various concentrations of emodin (20, 40 and 80 M) after 24 h, the cells were collected with trypsinization, washed with PBS and resuspended in binding buffer (295 l) m were examined with the mitochondrial-specific lipophilic cationic fluorescent dye JC-1. cells were plated in 6-well plates and treated with different concentrations of emodin (20, 40 and 80 M) for 24 h at 37\u00b0C. the cells were then washed twice with PBS and analyzed using flow cytometry. the membranes were blocked with TBST buffer containing 5% skim milk for 1 h. after three times washing with TBST buffer, the membranes were further incubated with specific primary antibodies at room temperature for 1 h. emodin induces the apoptosis of HepaRG cells Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining was performed to quantify emodin-induced apoptosis. both the early and late apoptotic cell populations increased 7.5- and 8.3-fold in the HepaRG cells. emodin increases ROS generation in the HepaRG cells ROS plays an important role in the process of cell apoptosis. compared with the control group, the results showed that the ROS level was increased dose-dependently in HepaRG cells after emodin treatment. emodin induces apoptosis through a change in MMP and regulation of apoptosis-related proteins in HepaRG cells. the protein expression of cytochrome c (cytc) in mitochondria and the cytosol was measured by western blotting. this experiment demonstrated that emodin arrested the cell cycle at the S and G2/M phases in the HepaRG cells. emodin induced cell cycle arrest at the S and G2/M phases. expression of apoptosis-related proteins after treatment with emodin was determined. the protein bands were quantified and statistically analyzed. data for each image are expressed as the mean SD of three separate experiments. emodin induces the apoptosis of HepaRG cells Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining was performed to quantify emodin-induced apoptosis. both the early and late apoptotic cell populations increased 7.5- and 8.3-fold in the HepaRG cells. emodin reduced m and induces cytochrome c release from mitochondria. emodin induces apoptosis through a change in MMP and regulation of apoptosis-related proteins. expression of cytochrome c (cytc) in mitochondria and the cytosol was measured by western blotting. -actin and COX IV were analyzed as the internal control for the cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions, respectively. data for each image are expressed as the mean SD of three separate experiments (*P0.05 vs. the vehicle control). emodin induces apoptosis through activation of the mitochondrial signaling pathway in HepaRG cells. emodin treatment inhibited proliferation of HepaRG cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. a significant number of cells with chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation were observed compared to the untreated control. emodin appears to trigger apoptotic cell death in HepaRG cells. data are expressed as the mean SD of three separate experiments. emodin reduced m and induces cytochrome c release from mitochondria. treatment with emodin induced the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP m) in a dose-dependent manner. the percentage of cells in the S and G2/M phases increased from 31.742.46 to 52.122.00%. the results showed that the expression levels of p53, p21 and cyclin E proteins were significantly increased. however, other cyclin proteins (cyclin A and CDK2) were downregulated in HepaRG cells. treatment with emodin significantly increased the expression of pro-apoptotic Bax and decreased the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2. caspases are the most important effector molecules for the execution of apoptosis. emodin significantly decreased the viability of HepaRG cells in a dose and time-dependent manner. DAPI and Annexin V/PI double staining confirmed that emodin inhibited the growth of HepaRG cells in a dose-dependent manner via apoptosis. the mitochondria play an essential role in emodin-induced apoptosis of HepaRG cells. this is the first report of emodin-induced apoptosis in HepaRG cells. previous studies have shown that emodin induced apoptosis in cancer cells. emodin inhibited the apoptosis via the downregulation of ROS-mediated signal cascades. the authors declare that they have no competing interests. the authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
