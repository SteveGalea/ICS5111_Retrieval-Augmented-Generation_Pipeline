{"summary": "hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection constitutes a serious public health problem. chronic HBV infection significantly elevates the risk for developing liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. preS1 region of HBV surface protein Is Essential for Viral Entry HBV infection into host hepatocytes follows a multiple step process. initial attachment and specific receptor recognition contribute to host specificity and tissue tropism. cellular factors involved in the high-affinity binding and the early entry process remained to be elucidated until recently. the molecular requirement of HBV envelope proteins for HBV infection has been studied for more than a decade using primary hepatocytes from humans and Tupaia belangeri, as well as HepaRG cells [21]. a series of analyses using neutralizing antibodies and introduced point mutations suggested that the S and preS1, but not the preS2, regions play a significant role in HBV infection [22\u201327]. lipopeptide was confirmed to specifically bind human NTCP (hNTCP), as well as tsNTCP, but not crab-eating monkey NTCP (mkNTCP), which correlated with the species specificity of HBV infection. this result also correlated with the in vitro binding activity of the peptide to the respective primary hepatocytes and their in vivo hepatotropism [37] infection efficiency was 10% in NTCP-overexpressing HepG2 cells. increased DMSO concentration to more than 2.5%3% augmented infection efficiency to 50%70%. speculations include that DMSO augmented the gene expression of NTCP, promoted the membrane localization of NTCP and changed the post-translational modification of NTCP. 157\u2013165 of NTCP are crucial for NTCP-mediated HBV binding and infection. hNTCP bearing a substitution of the 84\u201387 aa from the mouse counterpart supported the infection. mNTCP was shown to support specific binding of the preS1-lipopeptide on the cell surface. it is of particular interest to clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying the different cellular requirements between HBV and HDV. it is unclear whether there are additional cellular factors besides NTCP required for viral infection. these include factors essentially involved in the viral lifecycle during attachment, internalization, endocytosis, membrane fusion, uncoating, nuclear translocation and cccDNA formation. NTCP NTCP is a member of the solute carrier family 10A1 (SLC10A1). apical sodium-dependent bile salt transporter (ASBT) are sodium-dependent transporters for bile acids. NTCP is distributed at the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes. hNTCP is a 349 aa protein with an apparent mass of 56 kDa. it includes a putative seven or nine transmembrane domains with a predicted topology of N-terminal extracellular and C-terminal intracellular ends. ASBTNM shows a ten transmembrane domain and a hydrophobic inward-facing binding cavity. non-synonymous SNPs, I223T decreased plasma membrane-localized NTCP and reduced its transporter activity. the variant, seen in 5.5% of allele frequencies in african americans, decreased plasma membrane-localized NTCP and reduced its transporter activity. myrcludex-B is an optimized synthetic lipopeptide consisting of the myristoylated 2\u201348 aa region of preS1. enfuvirtide is the first peptidic HIV entry inhibitor mimicking the region derived from the viral gp41 envelope glycoprotein. enfuvirtide is the first peptidic HIV entry inhibitor mimicking the region derived from the viral gp41 envelope glycoprotein. isomerases that catalyze conformational changes in proteins and are the primary cellular target for CsA, were critical for efficient viral replication. however, the anti-HBV entry activity of CsA was not mediated by the inhibition of CyP, but rather via direct targeting of NTCP. this suggests that CsA interacted with NTCP, thus inhibiting the recruitment of LHBs of incoming HBV to NTCP on the plasma membrane and blocking HBV entry. compounds modulating NTCP function could substantially inhibit HBV entry. oxidized derivatives of cholesterol or by-products of cholesterol biosynthesis are also useful for high-throughput screening to identify compounds targeting NTCP."}
