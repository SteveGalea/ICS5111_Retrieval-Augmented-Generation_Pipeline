{"summary": "the structure of an RNA molecule is widely recognized to play a role in many processes, including structurally organizing complex RNAs. one common RNA folding motifs is a pseudoknot, the folding back of a single-stranded RNA onto itself to form two helical structures with single-stranded loops joining them (2). a complete understanding of this mechanism remains untested. changes affecting ribosome pause times affect frameshift efficiencies. mRNA pseudoknots and energetically equivalent stem\u2013loop structures promote ribosome pausing. mRNA pseudoknots are more efficient at promoting 1 PRF (8). the potential energy of unwinding should be distributed along the length of Stem 1. however, if the loop is anchored or restrained, Stem 2 cannot be fully unwound until Stem 2 is first denatured. mechanically, as the ribosome begins to unwind the base of Stem 1. an elongating ribosome can easily unwind a simple stem\u2013loop. there is no resistance to the rotation of the loop, even with a long stem. the energy required to unwind the structure is broadly distributed along its length. in vitro frameshifting assays show frameshifting can be significantly stimulated by limiting the rotational freedom of the loop region of a stem\u2013loop structure. mRNA toeprint analyses reveal a pseudo-pseudoknot-specific strong stop 16 nt 3\u2032 of the slippery site, consistent with this structure being able to direct ribosomes to pause. firefly luciferase reporter plasmid pT7-LUC minus 3\u2032-untranslated region-A50. expression of firefly luciferase requires a 1 frameshift. the 5\u2032 sequence of the Stem 2 is not able to base pair with the 3\u2032 sequence, so that only a stem\u2013loop rather than a pseudoknot is able to form. pJD366-18 was further mutated to make a zero-frame control by placing an A upstream of the slippery site using the oligonucleotides 5\u2032-TGACTTCTAGGCAAGGGTTTAGGAGTG and 5\u2032-CACTCCTAAACCCTTGCCTAGAAGTCA. a series of synthetic DNA oligonucleotides were designed to join the loop acceptor region of mRNA transcribed from pJD366 structures of the pJD366-R pseudoknot (R), of the pJD366-18 stem\u2013loop (SL) and of pseudo-pseudoknots formed by annealing SL with J1-, R1-, J4- and R4-oligos. proteins were eliminated by the addition of 2 l of 1 mg/ml proteinase K and SDS to a final concentration of 0.5% followed by digestion at 50\u00b0C in vitro translation and frameshifting assays To anneal the oligonucleotides with the mRNA, J-oligos, R-oligos or the equivalent volumes of dilution buffer alone (20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mM MgCl2 and 50 mM EDTA final concentration) were added to synthetic mRNA (0.5 g), and the mixtures were first incubated in a 70\u00b0C heating block for 10 mRNA toeprinting pJD366-18 (1.7 kb) was annealed with 1 l of annealing buffer and either 1 l of H2O or 1 l of an oligo. reactions incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. in vitro translation reactions were incubated at room temperature for 10 min. reaction was terminated by phenol:chloroform extraction. reaction incubated at room temperature for 10 min. se reporter plasmid pT7-LUC minus 3\u2032-untranslated region-A50 (24) expression of firefly luciferase requires a 1 frameshift. the 5\u2032 sequence of the Stem 2 is not able to base pair with the 3\u2032 sequence, so that only a stem\u2013loop rather than a pseudoknot is able to form. oligonucleotides 5\u2032-TGACTTCTAGGCAAGGGTTTAGGAGTG and 5\u2032-CACTCCTAAACCCTTGCCTAGAAGTCA were designed to join the loop acceptor region of mRNA transcribed from pJD366-18. the 5\u2032 regions of these oligos base pair with the downstream sequence. this orientation is reversed for the R-oligos. mRNA to form a pseudo-pseudoknot mimics the activity of a pseudoknot. structures of the pJD366-18 stem\u2013loop (SL) and of pseudo-pseudoknots formed by annealing SL with J1-, R1-, J4- and R4-oligos. oligos, R-oligos or equivalent volumes of dilution buffer alone were added to synthetic mRNA (0.5 g) in all experiments, the molar ratios of J- and R-oligos to synthetic mRNAs were 100:1. in experiments using the competing oligonucleotide (C-oligo), this was added to either 0.5:1 or 1:1 molar ratios with either J- or R-oligonucleotides RNAs (4 l) were incubated with 1 l of annealing buffer and either 1 l of H2O or 1 l of an oligo (0.25 ng) the heating block was allowed to cool at room temperature for 40 min before 8 l of RNaseH buffer was added (20 mM HEPES, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM DTT) 15 l of RT buffer containing RNasin inhibitor and cycloheximide was added to stop translation. reaction terminated by phenol:chloroform extraction and 15 l of stop solution added. mRNAs generated from pJD366-0 (0), pJD366-R (R) and pJD366-18 (SL) were used as substrates for in vitro translation using rabbit reticulocyte lysates. results are shown as percent of the zero-frame control. increasing numbers of nucleotides were inserted between the mRNA hybridizing regions of the J- and R-oligos. the additional non-complementary bases in the R-oligos are 3\u2032 to the stem\u2013loop residues involved in Stem 2, thus effectively increasing Loop 2. the arrow indicates the 5\u2032 110 nt fragment after incubation with J1 and RNaseH (lane 7). the next step was to monitor frameshifting efficiencies promoted by these hybrid species. significant increases in frameshifting were observed with the incubation of pJD366-18 mRNA with oligonucleotides J1 (10%) and J2 (35%) increasing the length of the bridging regions in these oligonucleotides (R1 to R3) resulted in decreased frameshifting activity as predicted by the torsional resistance model. however, addition of three residues between the two binding regions of the R-oligo (R4) resulted in an unexpected increase in frameshifting with a very large amount of variation. neither of these were able to stimulate 1 PRF, even at concentrations in 100-fold molar excess to the mRNA transcribed from pJD366-18 (SL) was annealed with either pJD366-18 (SL) or in combination with different concentrations of competing (C-) oligos. mRNA toeprint reactions block movement of reverse transcriptase. synthetic JD366-18 mRNAs were annealed with the sequencing oligonucleotide. elongation reactions were stopped by the addition of cycloheximide. control reverse transcription reactions were carried out using synthetic JD366-18 mRNA and oligonucleotides, but without in vitro translation. mRNAs generated from pJD366-18 (SL) were annealed with the sequencing oligonucleotide and either J1-, R1- or no oligo (lanes 1, 2 and 3, respectively) reverse transcription reactions were initiated on the sequencing oligonucleotides. mRNAs generated from pJD366-0 (0), pJD366-R (R) and pJD366-18 (SL) were used as substrates for in vitro

transcription reactions were initiated on the sequencing oligonucleotides. a loop 2\u2013Stem 1 triplex interaction seen in smaller frameshifting pseudoknots from luteoviruses has been shown to be critical for 1 PRF. this extra structural feature would limit the rate of unfolding and provide extra anchoring of Stem 2. a general correlation was observed between minimization of rotational freedom and frameshifting efficiency. the stability of the pseudo-pseudoknot generated with R4 should be similar to that of the other oligonucleotides based on the base-pairing, but this result suggests there are additional considerations to be uncovered. the mRNA pseudoknot is activated by movement of the downstream message into the ribosome at accommodation. it is possible that the pseudoknot may also actively contribute to the frameshift mechanism. this could result in unwinding of Stem 1 of the pseudoknot by one additional base pair. oligonucleotide:mRNA duplexes can stimulate efficient 1 ribosomal frameshifting (29,30) these studies differed from the present one in a number of ways, particularly insofar as they examined the effects duplex structures immediately 3\u2032 of the slippery
