{"summary": "PEDV is the causative agent of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) characterized by watery diarrhea, dehydration, and significant mortality in piglets. it has caused tremendous economic losses to the swine industry in Europe, Asia, and America. in 2013, the variant virus outbreak also occurred in the united states. Virus, cells, and antibody African green monkey kidney cell line (Vero E6) and SP2/0 myeloma cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle medium. six-week-old BALB/c mice were obtained from the Shanghai Slack Laboratory Animal (Shanghai, China) rN protein was purified using the Ni-NTA HisBind Resin. a second immunization was given using the purified rN protein (50 mg/mouse) emulsified in Freund's incomplete adjuvant in 1:1 proportion. the immunization was repeated every 2 weeks. the membrane was blocked with 5% skimmed milk in TBST (TBS with 0.1% Polysorbate-20) on a shaking table for 1 h at room temperature. the hybridoma cell supernatant was added into the NC membrane for 1 h at room temperature. after washing three times with TBST, the membrane was incubated with the HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. monkey kidney cell line (Vero E6) and SP2/0 myeloma cells were cultured at 37\u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle medium. six-week-old BALB/c mice were obtained from the Shanghai Slack Laboratory Animal (Shanghai, China) a pair of primers were designed and used for RT-PCR to amplify N gene. rN protein was purified using the Ni-NTA HisBind Resin. a second immunization was given using the purified rN protein (50 mg/mouse) emulsified in Freund's incomplete adjuvant in 1:1 proportion. membrane was blocked with 5% skimmed milk in TBST (TBS with 0.1% Polysorbate-20) the hybridoma cell supernatant was added into the NC membrane for 1 h at room temperature. after washing three times with TBST, the membrane was incubated with the HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:6000 dilution in TBST) for 1 h at room temperature. rN protein (52 kDa) was expressed in the supernatant in E. coli efficiently. rN protein was easily purified by using his-binding resin. generation of MAb against PEDV N protein Indirect ELISA indicated that antibody titers reached 1:100,000 compared with negative control. reacted with PEDV-infected Vero E6 cells exclusively. SP2/0 cell culture supernatant had negligible reactivity with PEDV-infected Vero E6 cells. vero cells, which were inoculated with PEDV, are inspected with hybridoma cell supernatant. olating splenic cells were fused with SP2/0 myeloma cells for generation of MAbs. one positive MAb against PEDV N protein was identified and named 2B8. a series of ten times diluted serum was added into ELISA plates coated by rN protein. PEDV N protein is a phosphorylated nucleocapsid protein binding to the genomic RNA. it can be used as a target for the accurate and early diagnosis of PEDV infection."}
