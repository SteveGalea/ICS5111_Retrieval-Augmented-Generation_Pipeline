Eckol showed slightly low activity against UVB radiation-mediated ROS (174.4% ROS at 250 M) as compared to dieckol (100.7% ROS at 250 M) the level of ROS was recorded as 234.1% in UVB-irradiated cells. eckol had about 21%, 43%, and 53% inhibitory activity at concentrations of 0.5, 5, and 50 M, respectively. Eckol showed lower IC50 than that of the weakest dioxinodehydroeckol. inhibition of more than 50% at a concentration of 163.93 g/mL was exhibited by ethanol extracts of seaweeds. eckol acted as an 2-P (IC50 1.6 g/mL), an 2-M (IC50 1.8 g/mL), an 1 anti-trypsin (IC50 0.8 g/mL), and thrombin (IC50 13 g/mL) inhibitor. eckol exhibited very weak inhibition on anti-thrombin III-heparin complex. only the dibenzo-1,4-dioxane skeleton is important for the potent anti-inhibitor activity as compared to the other hydroxyl groups present in eckol. a simple dibenzo-1,4-dioxane skeleton with other functional groups could be clinically useful in stimulating fibrinolysis. development of multidrug-resistant bacteria has created a special need for research on new antibacterial agents. eckol, dieckol, dioxinodehydroeckol, and phlorofucofuroeckol-A exhibited a strong anti-MRSA activity. neuraminidase (NA) plays a critical role as a target in the development of drugs against influenza. IC50 value of 89.5 M against A/Bervig_Mission/1/18 (H1N1) failed to show any significant inhibition on the other virus strains (IC50 > 200 M) compared with the other tested compounds (7-phloroeckol, phlorofucofuroeckol, and dieckol) a bioassay-directed isolation of E. cava led to the isolation of eckol, 8,8\u2019-bieckol, 8,4\u2019dieckol, and phlorofucofuroeckol-A. eckol, 8,8\u2019-bieckol, 8,4\u2019dieckol, and phlorofucofuroeckol-A failed to show any activity, even if they were produced from RT inhibitor fractions having 80% inhibition fucodiphloroethol G, dieckol, and phlorofucofuroeckoeckol-A were isolated from the ethanol extract of E. cava. eckol (IC50 8.8 M) and dieckol (IC50 2.7 M) exhibited potent inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV 3CLpro cell-free cleavage. the plasma glucose level showed a decrease in J-CA-HFD and G-CA-HFD. the expression of inflammatory cytokines, TNF-, interleukin (IL)-1, and the macrophage marker F4/80 was elevated in PBS-HFD mice as compared to the normal chow mice. treatment with 12.5, 50, and 200 g/mL extract also decreased the lipid accumulation by 52.2%, 53.2%, and 62.6%, respectively in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. pancreatic lipase is involved in the absorption of triglycerides by the small intestine which eventually gets secret by the pancreas. eckol lacks ether linkage at the C-7 position of its phlorotannin skeleton. it showed much weaker activity against pancreatic lipase than fucofuroeckol A and 7-phloroeckol, having one phloroglucinol element in the same position. the molecular weight difference between the compounds had no impact on their pancreatic lipase inhibitory activity. eckol suppresses stemness and malignancies, and sensitizes glioma-stem-like cells to anticancer treatments. the compounds were phloroglucinol, eckol, 7-phloroeckol, 2-phloroeckol, and fucosterol. eckol had the highest activity against selected cancer cell lines. phloroglucinol, eckol (trimer), phlorofucofuroeckol-A (pentamer), dieckol, 8,8\u2019-bieckol (hexamers), and an unknown tetramer showed potent inhibition. catechin, epigallocatechin gallate, and sodium cromoglycate had an IC50 value of 620, 190, and 270 M, respectively. phlorofucofuroeckol-A showed 23.97%, 44.26%, and 34.54% of relative histamine release at the highest concentration (100 M) in both the KU812 and RBL2H3 cells, calcium ionophore A23187 mediated the inhibitory effect of the phlorotannins. phlorotannins showed inhibition of barrier disruption mediated by LPS and trans-endothelial migration of leuk. phlorofucofuroeckol-A showed inhibitory activity similar to or greater than epigallocatechin gallate. hydrogen donating hydroxyl groups present in dieckol regulated its protection ability. eckol inhibited acetic acid-induced hyperpermeability and leukocyte migration. a change with the methyl group at the hydroxyl position of dieckol diminished the vascular barrier protective effects. five phlorotannins (i.e., phloroglucinol, eckol, dieckol, phlorofucofuroeckol-A, and 8,8\u2019-bieckol) purified from E. bicyclis were evaluated for their potential inhibition on bee venom, porcine pancreas secretory phospholipase A2, soybean lipoxygenase, 5-LOX, COX-1, and the phlorotannins had negligible inhibitory effects on COX-1 and COX-2. eckol showed 43.2% inhibition of COX-2 at 100 M [72]. the phlorotannins had negligible inhibitory effects on COX-1 and COX-2. furoeckol-B suppressed ear edema at a concentration of 0.01 or 0.1 mg. the phlorotannins behaved more strongly towards ear edema when treated with AA and OXA rather than TPA. all the sensitizers were inhibited in a similar manner to epigallocatechin gallate. the effects of eckol and dieckol isolated from ethanolic extract of E. stolonifera were investigated on lipid levels in the serum of hyperlipidemic rats. the rats fed with a high-cholesterol diet showed elevated levels of TC (255.6 8.7 mg/dL), TG (240.2 14.0 mg/dL) and LDL-C (145.1 10.4 mg/dL) phloroglucinol, dioxinodehydroeckol, eckol, phlorofucofuroeckol-A, dieckol, and 7-phloroeckol were found to be potent Cu2+-induced LDL oxidation inhibitors. lag time can be used as a measure of LDL oxidation resistance. phloroglucinol, dioxinodehydroeckol, eckol, phlorofucofuroeckol-A and dieckol showed higher inhibition than arbutin. dieckol showed a three times higher inhibition than kojic acid. eckol has shown promising results in anti-hair loss, anti-hearing loss, and anti-osteoporosis treatments. treatment with E. cava enzymatic extract resulted in the proliferation of immortalized vibrissa dermal papilla cells (DPCs) temporary threshold shift accelerates the age-related hearing loss even if it is a transient one. the primary cause of TTS is ROS, the protective activity of polyphenolic extract of E. cava (PPEE) was evaluated. eckol containing PPEE may have good potential to break the vicious cycle of TTS. eckol has been evaluated copiously for a broad spectrum of activities to establish it as a potential therapeutic agent. the results of the cell-based experiments could act as future references for in vivo experiments to doubtlessly highlight antioxidant potential. eckol also showed promising results in diabetes suppression. neuroprotection, the GABAA\u2013BZD receptor and dopamine receptors hold a good future for eckol due to its potent anticoagulative effect. the high activity of eckol in AChE enzyme inhibition but not in BChE inhibition [26] explains its selective nature, including moderate hMAO-B inhibition [53] cell-based and in vivo experiments are imperative to show its actual therpeutics. the antithrombotic activity of eckol was attributed to ACE-inhibition. the closed-ring dibenzo-1,4-dioxane was crucial for the inhibition. eckol could further be tested in vivo to establish its potential. the use of eckol as an anti-oxidant, anti-diabetic, radioprotective, hepatoprotective, and anti-inflammatory agent is a refreshing new discovery. the cell-based experiments related to tyrosinase inhibition by eckol could be beneficial as future references for experiments on the living subjects. eckol is a novel exploration for the treatment of major neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s disease. the major reason for the broad spectrum of activity related to eckol is possibly due to its structure. developing eckol as a single pharmaceutical product could be beneficial in the field of medicine."}
