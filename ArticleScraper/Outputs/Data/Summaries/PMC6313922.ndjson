{"summary": "canine cancer patients can have limited therapeutic options due to financial access or safety barriers. recent one health initiatives have highlighted the use of pet dogs with spontaneous cancer as translational models for the development of human cancer therapies. canine patients tend not to be treated as aggressively or consistently as humans. euthanasia of patients is used extensively in veterinary medicine, leading to shorter survival times. this combined with the strong parallels between humans and dog cancers is a major advantage. AdvaxTM induces minimal inflammation even when compared to alum adjuvant formulations [31] and has been shown to be safe and effective in human trials of vaccines against influenza [32] hepatitis B [31] and allergy [33]. we hypothesized that using streptavidin as an immune stimulant may provide an enhanced safety profile but also avoid regulatory T cells that suppress anti-tumor responses. addition of a similar foreign bacterial protein such as rhizavidin may improve the immune response to vaccination. secondary aims were to assess for subjective responses and decide what tumour types the vaccine might best be targeted at in future studies. a minimum of 0.1 g sample was required and each sample was processed into the vaccine which produces four doses via the following method. each final dose contained 0.2 mL AdvaxTM at 50 mg/mL with or without 25 g of rhizavidin. autologous vaccine was injected intramuscularly (I.M) at 0.4 mL at rotating sites as distal to the original tumor location as possible. patients received two doses of vaccine 2 weeks apart but as more preclinical safety and efficacy data were generated, the regimen was switched to an induction phase of four vaccine doses at weekly internals. new cancer 3 months after starting vaccination Mast Cell tumour (MCT) high grade (multiple tumours) Golden Retriever (FN7) Resection 1 g 5 (initially weekly 4, then 4 weeks apart) Still alive 2 months CR Had curative intent surgery for MCT recurrence and multiple new lesions.

(2011) [37]. canine mammary tumors were classified according to goldschmidt et al. (2011) [38]. tumor measurement, shape and appearance were recorded in the patient\u2019s clinical record. dogs that presented with cancers had thoracic radiography performed. heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature were monitored and recorded for a 2-h period post vaccination. the vaccine injection site was observed for any signs of swelling, redness, or ulceration. the trial cessation criteria included any significant side effects requiring hospitalization in up to three animals or vaccination causing death in any animal. additional patients at three veterinarian practices were treated on compassionate grounds after owners gave informed consent. 0.2 mL AdvaxTM at 50 mg/mL with or without 25 g of rhizavidin and 0.01 mg/mL Thiomersal as a preservative. rhizavidin used in this study was donated by Dr George Anderson. ge Sample size Vaccine doses Survival time Status Medication/Observations Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) stage IIIB American Staffordshire Bullterrier

histopathology and any applicable tumor grading performed on their dog\u2019s tumor. this was done by a veterinary pathologist at a commercial pathology laboratory or via in-house assessment at the University of Queensland. if >10 mm in size, a fine needle aspirate was performed to evaluate for metastatic disease in the enlarged node. the amount of staging performed depended on the veterinary facility the dog was presented to, cost associated with testing, and the cancer type. the cancers were staged using the information received from these tests. two of the 27 patients were lost to follow up due to owners moving. there was no evidence of local injection site reactions. no cases of anaphylaxis were recorded. the one dog with complete remission had a diagnosis of non-epitheliotrophic T-cell lymphoma. the data suggested better than expected outcomes in some immunized patients. this suggestion of clinical benefit supports further testing in placebo-controlled clinical trials. new preclinical data confirming better efficacy with weekly vaccinations in murine models of cancer is establishing the most effective dosing schedule. no significant difference was seen between groups receiving either the weekly 4 with monthly boosts (n = 12) and monthly interval (n = 5) groups. ous vaccine formulated with AdvaxTM adjuvant, the data might provide initial insights into which tumor types may respond best to this vaccine approach. a variety of solid and blood tumors were treated. no significant difference was seen due to low numbers for each cancer type. no cases of anaphylaxis were recorded in dogs already suffering from osteoarthritis. only two grade 1 reactions were observed, as classified by the VCOG-CTCAE. a weekly induction schedule followed by monthly boosters, supports further testing in placebo-controlled clinical trials. the current status and survival period post-vaccination of each patient receiving vaccinations with or without rhizavidin was recorded at the census cutoff. no significant difference was seen between groups receiving either the weekly 4 with monthly boosts (n = 12) and monthly interval (n = 5) groups. this compares to 50% in the second weekly group and 0% in groups receiving a single dose (indicative of end stage terminal disease) the autologous cancer vaccine containing AdvaxTM was administered alone or in combination with a variety of other cancer treatments. the vaccine is safe to use as a stand-alone therapy or combined with standard of care (SOC) therapy. 80% of patients have stable disease at the time of the census. autologous vaccine produced positive clinical benefits including remissions, static disease and amelioration of cancer-associated symptoms. many dog owners do not pursue current best practice cancer therapies such as radiotherapy or chemotherapy for their pets due to financial considerations. a more intense weekly vaccination schedule for four doses up front may improve response rates and outcomes. the wide range of cancers treated by autologous vaccine varied from blood cancers (lymphoma) to various solid tumor types (mast cell tumor, osteosarcoma etc.)
