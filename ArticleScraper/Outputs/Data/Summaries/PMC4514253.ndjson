{"summary": "mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin rAd5 recombinant adenovirus type 5 CMI cell-mediated immune responses IM intramuscular IN intranasal SC subcutaneous IFN- interferon gamma ELISPOT Enzyme-linked immune-sorbent spot SFC spot-forming cells tPA tissue plasminogen activator HA tag hemagglutinin tag SDS-PAGE sodium do recombinant viral vector-based vaccines AdAg85a, MV85A, and Aeras-402 (Crucell Ad35) showed some promising potentials in inducing cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses. the disappointing results of the recent MVA85A trial have raised the issue of incorporating multiple antigens into TB vaccines. parenteral administration of adenoviral-based vaccines reduced the bacterial load in the spleen rather than in the lung. vaccines generated specific T cells, especially CD8+ T cells, in the lung and thus provided protection against pulmonary TB. the fusion protein was vaged into separate Ag85A and Mtb32 peptides. the coding sequences of Ag85A and Mtb32 were optimized. an HA tag and a Flag tag were added to the terminus of Ag85A. o cells were infected with these vectors using equivalent viral particles. a rAd5-empty was used as negative control. the results showed that all 4 fusion antigens were efficiently expressed. gsgAM generated the strongest cellular responses in both the spleen and the lung. all 4 forms of Ag85A-Mtb32 fusions generated robust CMI responses in both the spleen and the lung. IFN-+ spot-forming cells in the spleen were not expanded in any groups. robust Ag85A- and Mtb32-specific IFN-+ spot-forming cells were generated in the lung. gsgAM induced the strongest specific responses for both Ag85A and Mtb32 in the lung. splenocytes and lung lymphocytes were harvested and cultured with peptide pools for each antigen and subject to an IFN-ELISPOT assay. the data were analyzed by 2-way ANOVA. the bars represent the standard error of the mean.

II Ad5-wtAM Ad5-wtAM III Ad5-optAM IV Ad5-gsgAM V Ad5-sAM Ad5-sAM a IM, intramuscular immunization. b IN, intranasal immunization. gsgAM appeared to generate the highest levels of Ag85A-specific CD4+ and Mtb32-specific CD8+ T cells. sAM was shown to elicit more Mtb32-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells than optAM only in the spleen. a significant proportion of antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells secreted dual or triple cytokines. C57Bl/6 mice were subcutaneously primed with BCG. gsgAM then boosted with gsgAM through IM, SC, oral, and IN routes. only moderate splenic responses were boosted by oral and IN immunization. the percentage of antigen-specific cytokine-secreting CD4+ T cells of total CD4+ T cells in the spleen. the percentage of antigen-specific cytokine-secreting CD8+ T cells of total CD8+ T cells in the spleen. a booster immunization with a rAd5 vectored vaccine could boost immune responses in the lung. a booster immunization with a fusion antigen via IM and SC injections could significantly boost systemic immune responses. 4 forms of rAd5 fusion genes harbored in rAd5 vectors were generated. an HA tag and a Flag tag were added to the Napos; terminus of Ag85A and the COOHapos; terminus of Mtb32. the function mechanism of 2A auto-cleavage peptide in the expression of Ag85A-Mtb32 fusion antigens. a band with a molecular weight similar to that of the Ag85A-Mtb32 fusion protein appeared in the lysates of Ad5-wtAM- and Ad5-optAM-infected cells. most of the separated Mtb32 was secreted into the culture medium due to the presence of a natural signal sequence. gsgAM generated the highest level of IFN- ELISPOT responses in both the spleen and the lung. all 4 forms of Ag85A-Mtb32 fusions generated robust CMI responses in both the spleen and the lung. gsgAM generated the strongest cellular responses in both the spleen and the lung. codon usage optimization in general did not significantly enhance immune responses with the exception for the Mtb32 specific response in the lung after IN boost. gsgAM induced the strongest cell mediated IFN- ELISPOT responses in both the spleen and the lung after IM prime and boost. C57BL/6 mice were immunized with control Ad5-empty or rAd5 vectors. at 2 weeks after prime or boost, splenocytes and lung lymphocytes were harvested and cultured with peptide pools for each antigen. splenocytes and lung lymphocytes were stimulated with Ag85A-Mtb32 fusions. production of IFN-, TNF-, and IL-2, the major Type 1 cytokines important for the suppression and clearance of Mtb infection,22,23. gsgAM appeared to generate the highest levels of Ag85A-specific CD4+ T cells and Mtb32-specific CD8+ T cells. gsgAM generated the strongest Ag85A-specific CD4+ and Mtb32-specific CD8+ T cell responses in both the spleen and the lung after IN boost. a significant proportion of antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells secreted dual- or triple cytokines. lymphocytes were isolated and subjected to IFN- ELISPOT and ICS assays. splenic CMI responses were significantly boosted through IM and SC immunization. only moderate splenic responses were boosted by oral and IN immunization with gsgAM. 57BL/6 mice were first primed with BCG and then immunized with Ad5-gsgAM through 4 routes: IM, SC, IN, and oral. the data represents one of 2 independent experiments. the results of the ICS assay showed a trend similar to that observed in the ELISPOT assay. the influence of codon usage optimization, signal sequence, fusion linker, and immunization routes on the immunogenicity of fusion antigens has not yet been well defined. in this study, we compared the immunogenicity of 4 Ag85A-Mtb32 fusions to induce systemic and pulmonary immune responses. we found that the subcellular localizations of Ag85A and Mtb32 were not significantly altered by the various fusion strategies. codon-optimized Ag85A and Mtb32 are both secreted proteins with native secretory signal peptides. however, these signal sequences were either deleted or replaced by tPA signal sequence when incorporated into DNA or viral vectors. 4+ and CD8+ T cells in both the spleen and the lung (Figs. 3 and 4 compared gsgAM with optAM immunization group) gsgAM was better than 2A linker for Ag85A and Mtb32 fusion antigen in the respect of generating stronger systemic and pulmonary CMI response. administration of Ad5-gsgAM through SC and mucosal routes effectively boosted BCG-primed CMI responses in the spleen and lung respectively. a significant proportion of dual- and multi-functional CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was increased by SC and IM immunization in the spleen. robust CMI responses were generated either by IM prime plus IN boost with Ad5-gsgAM or by BCG prime plus Ad5-gsgAM boost in mice. a high frequency of Ag85A-specific IFN-+TNF-+ and IFN-+TNF-+IL-2+ CD4+ T cells was elicited. the combination of Ag85A and Mtb32 or multiple antigens as potential TB vaccine deserves further evaluation in an in vivo vector carrying the Ag85A-Mtb32 fusion antigen generated the strongest systemic and pulmonary immune responses in BCG-primed mice. future studies will be conducted in an in vivo Mtb challenge model to elucidate the relationship of the enhanced CMI responses. pAd5-optAM, pAd5-wtAM, pAd5-gsgAM, and pAd5-sAM were amplified in the strain XLI-Blue. the cells were infected with purified Ad5-optAM, Ad5-wtAM, Ad5-gsgAM, Ad5-sAM, and Ad5-empty. a 1:100 dilution of PE-labeled anti-HA antibody (Cat. bsm-0966m-PE) in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. the cells were then stained with DAPI. images of the slides were viewed and photographed using a fluorescence microscope. the animals were sacrificed with 2.5 109 vp Ad5-gsgAM through 4 routes: IM, SC, oral, and IN. at 2 weeks after boost immunization, the animals were sacrificed. the lungs were perfused by PBS through the right ventricle of the heart. the plates were developed with the biotinylated polyclonal anti-mouse IFN- (BD PharMingen) and NBT/BCIP reagent (Pierce) the number of IFN-releasing cells was counted by an ELISPOT reader (Bioreader 4000, BIOSYS, Germany) pGA1-gsgAM and pGA1-sAM were constructed by replacing the 2A-Mtb32-Flag fragment and the tPA-HA-Ag85A fragment in pGA1-optAM. the shuttle vectors were linearized and subjected to homologous recombination with the linearized Ad5 backbone (deletion of the E1 and E3 genes in the E. coli BJ5183 strain). s were amplified in XLI-Blue strain and prepared with a Qiagen kit. pAd5-optAM, pAd5-wtAM, pAd5-gsgAM, and pAd5-sAM were then linearized and transfected into HEK-293 cells to produce the respective recombinant adenovirus. animals and immunization strategies Six- to 8-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were obtained and housed at the Experimental Animals Center of the Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health. each mouse received 2 injections of 50ul in each thigh quadriceps muscle of hind legs at week 1. each mouse received a total dose of 2.5 109 vp in 2 aliquots with a fine-tip pipette at week 3. the lymphocytes of the spleen and the lung were isolated and subjected to subsequent immunological assays. an IFN- ELISPOT assay was performed to test the CMI responses induced by rAd5 vectors carrying different Ag85A-Mtb32 fusions. the number of IFN--releasing cells was counted by an ELISPOT reader. intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) and multicolor flowcytometry were performed as previously described.
