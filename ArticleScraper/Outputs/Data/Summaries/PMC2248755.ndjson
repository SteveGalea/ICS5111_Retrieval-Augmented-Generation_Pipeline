{"summary": "a 2- to 20-fold increase in the gag-Pol to Gag ratio prevents viral infectivity (4\u20137). the programmed \u20131 frameshift that determines this ratio represents an interesting target for the development of novel antiretroviral agents against HIV-1. double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) can modify the rate of translation initiation. TAR is a 59-nt stem-bulge-loop structure present at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 end of all HIV-1 mRNAs in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. a higher concentration of TAR inhibits PKR, the dsRNA-dependent protein kinase. eIF4F complex formed by three initiation factors. eIF4E, the cap-binding protein, eIF4G, a scaffold protein and eIF4A. after each round of initiation, eIF2 is released from the ribosome. a dual-luciferase construct (8) expresses the Renilla luciferase (Rluc) and the firefly luciferase (Fluc) separated by HIV-1 frameshift region as a fusion protein. this type of construct is adapted from Grentzmann et al.. pDual-HIV(-1) and (0) (8) contain the HIV-1 frameshift region inserted between the coding sequences of the Renilla luciferase (Rluc) and the firefly luciferase (Fluc). pDual-HIV(-1) and (0) differ from pDual-HIV(-1) by the addition of an adenine after the slippery sequence in the frameshift region. the oligonucleotides for the cassette were cass50nt-fwd and cass50nt-rev. the oligonucleotides for the cassette were cass50nt-fwd and cass50nt-rev. pTAR expresses the free TAR sequence in trans from the reporter mRNA. human embryonic kidney cells transformed with adenovirus and simian virus 40 large-T were maintained in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS. diluted PEI was added drop-wise to serum-free medium and incubated 10 min at room temperature. the HindIII\u2013ApaI fragment from pDual-in-frame was cloned into pcDNA5-FRT. cells stably expressing the (-1) or (0) dual-luciferase HIV reporter were transfected with 150 ng of the PKR ShortCut\u00aesiRNA Mix. the TAR-expressing plasmids were transfected 24 h after the transfection with a siRNA mix. cells were harvested 48 h after this second transfection and luciferase assays were performed. antigen\u2013antibody complexes were detected with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system. a dual-Luciferase reporter assay kit was used for Jurkat cells. a dual-luciferase reporters pDual-HIV(-1) and (0) (8) were constructed. to produce pDual-HIV-50TAR(-1) and (0), the TAR sequence is at a larger distance from the 5\u2032 end of the reporter mRNA. a cassette of a 50-nt non-coding sequence was inserted in the AflII site of pDual-HIV, followed by the insertion of TAR immediately after these 50 nt, in the HindIII site of pcDNA3.1Hygro+. transfection of jurkat and HEK 293T cells was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Wisent) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS (Wisent) and HEK 293T cells (human embryonic kidney cells transformed with adenovirus and simian virus 40 large-T) were maintained in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS. d at 3000 g for 5 min, washed with PBS and lysed in 100 l of Cell Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega) cell lysates were centrifuged 2 min at 13 000 g at 4\u00b0C to remove cell debris. selection of stable 293T transfectants expressing a dual-luciferase HIV reporter Plasmids pcDNA5-Dual-HIV(-1) and (0) were made by insert siRNA 293T transfectants (6.0 105 cells) were transfected with 150 ng of the PKR ShortCut\u00aesiRNA Mix or the eGFP ShortCut\u00aesiRNA Mix (New England BioLabs) the TAR-expressing plasmids were transfected 24 h after the transfection with a siRNA mix. cells were harvested 48 h after this second transfection and luciferase assays were performed. toethanol, 2% sodium dodecyl sulphate and 0.06 M Tris\u2013HCl, pH 6.9) were immunoblotted with a mouse anti-tubulin monoclonal antibody (clone B-5-1-2 Sigma) diluted 1/5000 and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody diluted 1/1500. antigen\u2013antibody complexes were detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence ( pDual-HIV-TAR was inserted at about 40 nt from the 5\u2032 end of the mRNA in pDual-HIV, generating pDual-HIV-TAR(-1) and (0). the frameshift efficiency was decreased to 70% of its value in absence of TAR in either Jurkat or 293T cells. the value of 5.1 0.4% is comparable to the values obtained with different heterologous systems containing the HIV-1 frameshift region. pDual-HIV-TAR and pDual-HIV-50TAR generate the free TAR sequence in trans from the reporter mRNA expressed from pDual-HIV. two other constructs were used, pDual-HIV-50TAR, where the distance between TAR and the 5\u2032 end of the reporter mRNA was increased by 50 nt. the frameshift efficiency was decreased to 75 and 60%, respectively, in Jurkat cells and 293T cells transfected with pDual-HIV-50TAR. the effect of TAR on the frameshift efficiency was confirmed when using an infection system to deliver the reporters into the cells. PKR is involved in the decrease in frameshift efficiency observed in the presence of TAR. the frameshift efficiency was assessed in lysates from Jurkat cells co-transfected with pDual-HIV, pDual-HIV-TAR or pTARuucg*. pDual-HIV-50TAR and pDual-HIV-50TAR were not significantly different from the value with pDual-HIV with Tat* but significantly lower than the value with pDual-HIV without Tat*. a plasmid expressing Tat, a viral protein, was co-transfected with the dual-luciferase plasmids. we used a Tat mutant (Tat*) that can bind TAR and inhibit pTAR, pTARbulge* or pTARuucg* in amounts ranging from 0 to 2.3 g. the frameshift efficiency increases to about 140% in absence of TAR. with a larger quantity of TAR, the frameshift efficiency decreases to about 80%, a decrease comparable to that observed with a transient transfection of pDual-HIV. the frameshift efficiency was assessed in lysates from stable 293T transfectants expressing the (-1) or (0) dual-luciferase HIV reporter transfected with pTAR (A), pTARbulge* (B) or pTARuucg* (B) in different amounts ranging from 0 to 2.3 g. results are the means SD of at least six independent experiments. pTAR was transfected with a eGFP siRNA mix (negative control) or a PKR siRNA mix (lane 2). equal amounts of proteins from lysates of stable 293T transfectants were separated by SDS\u2013PAGE. anti-tubulin blotting was used as an internal control for loading. jurkat cells were transfected with pDual-HIV(-1) or (0) plasmids. they were treated with thapsigargin, rapamycin or hippuristanol. the frameshift efficiency was increased about twofold in the presence of either of these inhibitors. pDual-HIV-TAR generates the free TAR sequence in trans from the reporter mRNA expressed from pDual-HIV. the frameshift efficiency was assessed in lysates from Jurkat cells (C) and 293T cells (D) transfected with pDual-HIV was arbitrarily set at 100%. the distance between TAR and the 5\u2032 end of the reporter mRNA was increased by 50 nt compared to pDual-HIV-TAR. the frameshift efficiency was decreased to 75 and 60%, respectively, in Jurkat cells and 293T cells transfected with pDual-HIV-50TAR. the effect of TAR on the frameshift efficiency was confirmed when using an infection system to deliver the reporters into the cells. frameshift efficiency was assessed in lysates from Jurkat cells co-transfected with pDual-HIV, pDual-HIV-TAR or pTARuucg*. the presence of a Tat mutant inhibits PKR decreases the frameshift efficiency. a plasmid expressing Tat, a HIV-1 viral protein, was co-transfected with the dual-luciferase plasmids. Tat influences translation by inhibiting PKR, either directly by binding this kinase or indirectly by blocking the binding of TAR to PKR. in the presence of Tat*, the frameshift efficiency was decreased to approximately 60% of its value. frameshift efficiency was assessed in lysates from stable 293T transfectants expressing the (-1) or (0) dual-luciferase HIV reporter transfected with pTAR (A), pTAR. the ratio of Fluc activity to Rluc activity in lysates from these transfectants was unchanged in the presence of pTAR. PKR expression was silenced by transfecting a PKR siRNA mix into stable 293T transfectants expressing a dual-luciferase HIV reporter. after 24 h, cells were transfected with pTAR in different amounts and harvested 48 h later. pTAR in different amounts ranging from 0 to 2.3 g. the presence of TAR alters the frameshift efficiency of PKR. a low amount of TAR increases the frameshift efficiency. variations in the phosphorylation level of eIF2 in 293T or Jurkat cells transfected with different quantities of TAR. however, we cannot exclude that PKR could also influence HIV-1 frameshift efficiency via another yet undiscovered mechanism. contradictory effects were seen in previous observations on the influence of the translation initiation rate on the frameshift efficiency. elongating ribosomes reach the frameshift region and explains how the rate of translation initiation affects the frameshift efficiency by modifying the spacing between these ribosomes. a ribosome must encounter a folded frameshift stimulatory signal to make a frameshift, but this encounter does not ensure that frameshifting will occur. a pause of about three seconds for the first ribosome is sufficient to prevent the refolding of the stimulatory signal. the third ribosome would encounter the folded frameshift stimulatory signal. a decrease in translation initiation would increase the frameshift efficiency since ribosomes would be further apart. efficiency doubled independently of the severity of the initiation defect. each other ribosome encounters the signal under basal conditions. a change in cap-dependent translation initiation could affect HIV-1 frameshift efficiency. an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) was identified in the 5\u2032UTR region of HIV-1 full-length mRNA (51) and another IRES was found in the beginning of the gag coding sequence (52) the use of an IRES by HIV-1 in the context of replication-competent viruses remains to be proven."}
