{"summary": "autoimmune diseases (AIDs) include type 1 diabetes (T1D), multiple sclerosis (MS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), rheumatoid arthritis (GD), ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) affect over 4% of western population and involve the generation of autoantibodies against self antigen/s. molecules present exogenous antigens for recognition by CD4+ T helper (Th) cells. strong associations with almost all AIDs have been detected. \u2013type, TAP = Transporters associated with antigen presentation, 2M = 2 Microglobulin, CLIP = class II associated invariant chain.

EVIDENCE FOR ROLE OF HLA CLASS I IN DISEASE Association of HLA class I molecules, in particular HLA-A, -B and \u2013C, has been detected for several AIDs. EVIDENCE FOR ROLE OF HLA CLASS I IN DISEASE Association of HLA class I molecules, in particular HLA-A, -B and \u2013C, has been detected for several AIDs. work in T1D identified a microsatellite D6S2223 4.9kb telomeric of DQ in the extended class I region. further work narrowed the association to a region encompassing the class III and HLA-B/-C gene regions. re-investigation of the HLA class I region as an independent general AID locus. association studies within a small Swedish dataset showed a predisposing effect for the A*0301 allele and a protective effect for the A*0201 allele in patients with MS [57], independent of the known DR15 association. the international MS genetics consortium detected an independent protective effect for C*05 (P = 3.3 x 10-5), in both a family and case control dataset [60]. functional effector T lymphocytes (CTLs) act before clonal expansion and differentiation of CD8+ T cells. they act as one of the first lines of innate immune defence by producing lymphokines, including interferons, which aid in the recruitment of additional cells to the site of inflammation. there is increasing evidence for a role of CD8+ T cells in AID. microbial antigens that are sufficiently similar to self-antigens activate autoreactive T-cells that can cross react with self antigen triggering autoimmunity. microbial antigens could act as superantigens, producing a strong non-specific immune response that then cross reacts attacking other tissues in the body. if confirmed these mechanisms could also help validate the role of viral/bacterial infection in AID onset.
