{"summary": "influenza viruses are classified based on differences in their internal glycoproteins nucleoprotein (NP) and matrix (M) influenza type A viruses can infect humans, birds, pigs, horses, and other animals, while influenza B and C viruses are found only in humans. the first cases of human infection with H5N1 influenza were reported in 1997. this virus has spread to many countries in Asia, Africa, and Europe. the most recent strain infecting humans was H7N9 in china, detected in 2011. shell Viral Culture (SVC) is another viral culture approach that has been in use since the early 1990s for clinical diagnosis of influenza virus infections. this approach involves propagation of viruses in mammalian cells grown in small 1-dram vials or shell vials. a modified SVC method using R-mix cells has demonstrated higher sensitivity compared to traditional viral isolation method with viral detection possible in 24\u201348 h. the approach involves propagation of viruses in mammalian cells grown in small 1-dram vials or shell vials, followed by staining with influenza virus-specific fluorescent monoclonal antibodies. the approach is relatively straightforward and more sensitive compared to traditional viral isolation method with viral detection possible in 24\u201348 h. a study comparing the performance of multiple tests for 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus (pH1N1) detection in 526 respiratory specimens reported assay sensitivities of 38.7% for DFA, 45.7% for virus isolation, and 18.2% for the QuickVue POC test. a modified cytospin-enhanced DFA has been used by several groups to enhance the sensitivity of DFA for influenza diagnosis. cytospin test showed an assay sensitivity of 92.5% (49/53) compared with the cell culture assay. serological assays most commonly used to detect influenza virus-specific antibodies include hemagglutination inhibition assay (HAI), microneutralization or virus neutralization assay (VN), single radial hemolysis (SRH), complement fixation assay, enzyme linked immunoabsorbant assay (ELISA) and Western blotting. SRH is used to measure complement-mediated hemolysis induced by antigen-antibody complexes. it is considered more sensitive than the HAI assay and does not require pretreatment of the serum to inactivate non-specific inhibitors. sensitivity of 90.7% (147/162) for influenza A viruses and 81.80 % (9/11) for influenza B viruses with 100% specificity. the highest serum dilution that prevents complete hemagglutination is called the HAI titer of the serum. single radiation hemolysis SRH is a technique commonly used to determine the induction of antibodies following natural infection or vaccination. it is considered more sensitive than the HAI assay and does not require pretreatment of the serum. ENIA showed up to 16-fold higher sensitivity than a commercially available photometric ELISA for the various strains of influenza A and B viruses tested. RIDTs are antigen-based tests developed for rapid diagnosis of influenza virus infections in POC settings. RIDTs have demonstrated variable assay performance with sensitivities ranging between 10%\u201370% compared to standard RT-PCR-based assays. a meta-analysis of 159 studies involving 26 commercial RIDTs showed a sensitivity of 62.3% compared to RT-PCR approaches. EZ Flu A+B, Directigen EZ Flu A+B, and QuickVue Influenza A+B reported assay sensitivities of 40% for BinaxNOW Influenza A&B, 49% for Directigen EZ Flu A+B, and 69% for QuickVue Influenza A+B compared to a RT-PCR-based assay. the CDC advised physicians not to discontinue antiviral therapy despite negative RIDT results. lab-on-a-chip/microchip (LoC) provides a new route to develop a new generation of POC influenza tests. the technology originates from microelectromechanical system (MEMS) technology. it has many fascinating advantages, such as high reaction efficiency, low reagent/energy consumption, low waste generation. a miniaturized all-in-one, real-time RT-PCR instrument was developed. a miniaturized all-in-one, real-time RT-PCR instrument was developed. a microchip electrophoretic immunoassay coupled with laser-induced fluorescence detector was developed to detect swine influenza virus. most tests take 2\u20134 h to complete, demonstrating higher sensitivity and specificity compared with antigen-based tests. RT-PCR is the most traditional yet powerful NAT approach for identification of influenza viruses in most diagnostic labs around the world. a real-time reverse transcription LAMP-based assay (RT-LAMP) demonstrated a sensitivity of 97.8% compared to an RT-PCR-based assay. the RT-LAMP assay performed better than a WHO-approved RT-PCR assay while testing 239 acute-phase throat swab samples from patients with influenza-like illness. NASBA is an isothermal PCR-independent amplification method. it uses a combination of three enzymes: avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, RNAse H, and T7 RNA polymerase in a single reaction. NASBA has been successfully evaluated for detection of both seasonal and avian influenza A viruses. an assay sensitivity of approximately 50 copies per reaction was comparable or higher than that observed with a commercial swine origin influenza A virus (S-OIV) (H1N1) real-time RT-PCR kit and CDC TaqMan assay. the SMART assay demonstrated an analytical sensitivity of up to 105 vRNA copies/mL with an assay sensitivity of 98.3%. detection requires labeling of multiple probes or incorporation of fluorescent dye- or biotin-conjugated nucleotides into double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) the sensitivities of most conventional microarray assays have been shown to rely on the efficiency of target amplification and hybridization of amplicons and probes. the design of multiple, virus-specific primer sets and optimization procedures pose diverse challenges. vRNA is allowed to bind to multiple capture, target, or intermediate oligonucleotides. nanomicroarray assay can be used to detect influenza A and B viruses. it can also simultaneously detect subtypes of influenza A viruses in a single assay using multiple samples per slide. loop-mediated isothermal nucleic acid amplification approach has been evaluated for detection of several viruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) corona virus, rhinovirus, adenovirus, new castle disease virus, monkey pox virus, human immunodeficiency virus, and influenza virus. sensitivity of the assay was 10 copies per reaction. the RT-LAMP assay performed better than a WHO-approved RT-PCR assay while testing 239 acute-phase throat swab samples from patients with influenza-like illness. it demonstrated up to 10-fold higher sensitivity compared to a WHO-approved RT-PCR assay with an analytical sensitivity of 0.1 TCID50/mL. NASBA uses a combination of three enzymes: avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, RNAse H, and T7 RNA polymerase in a single reaction. NASBA has been successfully evaluated for detection of both seasonal influenza A and highly pathogenic avian H5N1 and H7N9 avian influenza A viruses. the fluChip microarray has been shown to detect all known subtypes of influenza A viruses in less than five hours. a MChip microarray showed 95% sensitivity and 92% specificity to identify influenza A virus. nanoparticle-based genomic microarray assay (nanomicroarray) uses multiple oligonucleotides specially designed to target conserved regions from the entirely whole genome of genes coding for influenza A and B viruses. vRNA is allowed to bind to multiple capture, target, or intermediate oligonucleotides and are hybridized to special gold nanoparticles. the nanomicroarray images can be scanned for further analysis. this assay is a minimally-manipulated procedure that greatly reduces the number of amplifications, and omits fragment separation and purification. it is therefore suitable for screening and identification of a broad range of subtypes of influenza virus in a time- and labor-efficient manner. NGS offers significant improvements in sequencing speed and throughput when compared with Sanger sequencing. the expense for sequencing a human-sized genome using Sanger sequencing decreased from 100 million US dollars in 2001 to about 5000 dollars in 2014. a significant increase in drug resistance, from 0.4% in 1994\u20131995 to 12.3% in 2003\u20132004. several groups have successfully used the pyrosequencing platform to identify mutations in genes coding for hemagglutinin. ViroChip microarray and Illumina NGS techniques are used in the diagnosis of multiple patient samples. viroChip microarray allowed the correct detection of influenza pH1N1 without a priori information. a combination of this approach and pre-existing computational drug design may open up a new avenue to develop novel influenza inhibitors. three platforms, Ion PGM, PACBIO RS, and Illumina\u2019s MiSeq, were employed to sequence four microbial genomes with mean GC content ranging from 19.3% to 67.7%. the authors concluded that all three platforms provide near 100% coverage on GC-rich, neutral and moderately AT-rich genomes. this approach involves the use of DNA polymerase, a pair of DNA primers, and chain-terminating dideoxynucleotides (di-ddNTPs) with each base labeled with a unique fluorophore. this sequencing approach can generate 1000 bp DNA sequence reads per reaction. Sanger sequencing has been widely used for whole genome sequencing of influenza viruses. pyrosequencing is a high-throughput sequencing-by-synthesis bioluminescence method. it monitors real-time release of pyrophosphate following incorporation of dNTPs into a growing strand of nascent DNA. this sequencing platform has been evaluated as a diagnostic tool in influenza research. pyrosequencing was used to identify mutations in genes coding for HA and NA in an immunocompromised child infected with influenza A/H3N2 virus being treated with oseltamivir. pyrosequencing was used to identify G186D and R292K mutations in genes coding for HA and NA in an immunocompromised child. three platforms, Ion PGM, PACBIO RS and Illumina\u2019s MiSeq, were employed to sequence four microbial genomes with mean GC content ranging from 19.3% to 67.7%. a combination of this approach and pre-existing computational drug design may open up a new avenue to more efficiently develop novel influenza inhibitors. a universal RT-PCR-NGS diagnostic platform has been developed to detect influenza infections and co-infections in a single-tube. the platform can achieve highly sensitive detection equivalent to the clinical real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) test at low virus concentrations. a typical genetic matrix composition from a known and a novel emerging influenza infection can be determined [73] can detect and differentiate influenza A and B viruses, but have a limited capability to further subtype influenza A viruses. there has been a steady increase in resistance to currently used M2 and NA inhibitors among circulating seasonal and novel avian-origin influenza A viruses."}
