{"summary": "heme oxygenases-1 (HO-1) activity in the lung represents an important defense mechanism. HO-1 degrades heme into free divalent iron, carbon monoxide and biliverdin. these metabolites are known for the cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory effects. adaptive Tregs are developed throughout the course of the immune response in vivo. HO-1 induction is associated with elevation of Treg numbers in the context of intestinal inflammation and pregnancy in mice [2, 16] but questions remain to be addressed as to whether HO-1 is involved in the development of Tregs. BM-DCs were lysed in the lyses buffer (3% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 1.67 M urea and 2.7% 2-mercaptoethanol), resolved in a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electro. the cells were harvested for phenotypic analysis, western blotting or the analysis of T-cell responses. the membranes were blocked with TBST (50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.15 M NaCl and 0.05% Tween 20) containing 2.5% non-fat milk at room temperature for 1 hour and then incubated with primary antibodies at 4\u00b0C overnight. blots were washed with TBST four times in-between steps. nave CD4+ T cells from syngeneic Foxp3EGFP mice were analyzed by flow cytometer (LSR II; BD Biosciences) for in vivo Treg differentiation, nave CD4+ T cells (2 106 cells) from DO11.10 (Thy1.2+) mice were adoptively transferred into Thy1.1+ BALB/c mice on day -1, followed by intravenous or intratracheal administration of OVA323-339-pulsed BM-DCs (2 bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALFs) and local draining lymph node cells were collected. the cells were stained with PE-Cy7-anti-CD11c (N418; eBioscience), FITC-anti-I-Ad/I-Ed (M5/114.15.2; eBioscience), PE-anti-CCR3 (83101; R&D Systems), APC-anti-CD3 (145-2C11; BD Bioscience all mice were maintained by the Animal Center of Kaohsiung Medical University. the health and condition of all mice in this study were monitored daily prior to sacrifice. all mice have no clinical signs of ill health. phenotype and purity of BM-DCs were analyzed by flow cytometry (LSR II; BD Biosciences, San Diego, Calif., USA) the phenotype and purity of BM-DCs were analyzed by flow cytometry (LSR II; BD Biosciences, San Diego, Calif., USA) OVA323-339-pulsed-BM-DCs from BALB/c mice were cocultured with CD4+ T cells from DO11.10 mice for 4 days. the cells were then harvested and [3H] thymidine incorporation was measured in counts per minute (CPM) the 72-hour supernatant was collected for cytokine determination (ELISA, eBioscience) FITC-anti-KJ1-26 (KJ1-26; eBioscience), PE-Cy7-anti-CD3 (145-2c11; BD), PerCP-anti-CD4 (RM4-5; eBioscience) and PE-anti-CD25 (PC61; BD) were analyzed by flow cytometer (LSR II) results HO-1 induction inhibits LPS-induced maturation and proinflammatory activity in BM-DCs. BM-DCs significantly secreted more anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 but much less inflammatory cytokines, IL-12, IL-23, IL-6, and TNF- than control cells. BM-DCs were stimulated with or without LPS for 24 hours. BM-DCs were harvested for surface marker detection using flow cytometry and supernatants. BM-DCs from BALB/c mice were co-cultured with allogenic CD4+ T cells from C57BL/6 mice for 4 days. proliferative response was assessed by [3H]-thymidine assay. all treated BM-DCs in Fig 2 were stimulated with LPS. BM-DCs with HO-1 induction significantly promoted the Foxp3+ Treg differentiation from nave CD4+ T cells purified from Foxp3EGFP mice in vitro. BM-DCs were co-cultured with nave CD4+ T cells from Foxp3EGFP mice for 3 days in the presence of TGF- and anti-CD3 activating mAb. the treated BM-DCs in C were stimulated with LPS. the frequency (mean SD, n = 5) of Foxp3(EGFP)+ Tregs in CD4+ T cells was analyzed. OVA323-339-pulsed BM-DCs and DO11.10 nave CD4+ T cells from Thy1.2+ mice were intravenously transferred into Thy1.1+ mice for 5 days. all treated BM-DCs in Fig 4 were stimulated with LPS. coPP treatment suppresses DC-mediated airway inflammation in vivo. BM-DCs induce less airway inflammation in a neutrophil-dominant model. coPP-treated BM-DCs also mediated both eosinophil and neutrophil infiltrated lung inflammation. BALB/c mice were intratracheally injected with DMSO or CoPP-treated BM-DCs on day 0 and followed by daily OVA aerosol challenges on day 10\u201312. the next day after the last challenge, effector cells (A), cytokines (B) and Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) were analyzed by flow cytometry and ELISA. coPP-conditioned BM-DCs secreted more anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. IL-12, IL-23, IL-6, and TNF- than control cells in a concentration-dependent manner. these data showed that HO-1-expressing DCs displayed an anti-inflammatory phenotype. coPP-conditioned BM-DCs display tolerogenic phenotypes. coPP-treated BM-DCs induced significantly lesser degree of the allogenic T-cell proliferative response compared to the control cells. coPP-conditioned BM-DCs showed low CD4+ T-cell stimulatory activity. BM-DCs in Fig 2 were stimulated with LPS prior to DC-T coculture. HO-1-expressing DCs promote adaptive Treg differentiation. BM-DCs with HO-1 induction enhance PD-L1 expression. BM-DCs were co-cultured with nave CD4+ T cells from Foxp3EGFP mice for 3 days in the presence of TGF- and anti-CD3 activating mAb. the treated BM-DCs in C were stimulated with LPS. intratracheal administration was used to examine in vivo function of HO-1-expressing DCs. BM-DCs promote Ag-specific adaptive Treg differentiation in vivo. all treated BM-DCs in Fig 4 were stimulated with LPS. airway inflammation in vivo was also induced by DCs in two different administration ways. BM-DCs induced significantly less infiltrating eosinophils and neutrophils. coPP-treated BM-DCs also mediated both eosinophil and neutrophil infiltrated lung inflammation. data are pooled from one to two independent experiments. the line within the vertical points marks the mean for each group. all treated BM-DCs in Fig 5 were stimulated with LPS. this study provides evidence demonstrating the tolerance-inducing ability of HO-1-expressing DCs. the detailed molecular mechanisms involved in Treg differentiation induced by HO-1-expressing DCs are largely unknown. the role of HO-1 in regulating PD-L1 expression and in Foxp3+ Treg differentiation needs to be further investigated. induction may mediate anti-inflammatory status through coordinated contribution from several HO-l-expressing cell types. but only DC has the ability to mediate Ag-specific tolerance in several different mechanisms. IL-10 secreted by HO-1-expressing DCs at high level may enhance type 1 Treg (Tr1) differentiation. HO-1 expression also conserves IL-10 expression in rat BM-DCs and human monocyte derived DCs [34]. the observed discrepancies concerning the expression of tolerance-associated molecules (IL-10 and PD-L1) might be attributable to species-specific differences. Ag-specific Tregs induced by intravenous DC transfer may predominately act through cell-cell contact dependent mechanism. increased frequency of Ag-specific Treg cells induced by intravenous DC transfer may be manifested primarily in local lymph nodes, but not in the BALFs. further detailed and comprehensive kinetic analysis is required to properly address these possibilities. ide (CoPP) or tin protoporphyrin-IX (SnPP)-treated BM-DCs from BALB/c mice were stimulated with or without LPS (1 g/ml) for 24 hours. the HO-1 expression in total cell lysate was analyzed by (A) western blotting."}
