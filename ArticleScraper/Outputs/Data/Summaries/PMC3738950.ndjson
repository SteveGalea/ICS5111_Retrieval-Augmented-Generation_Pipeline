{"summary": "protein acetylation has emerged as a critical regulatory factor during herpesvirus infection. recent studies have linked acetylation events to promoter activity and maintenance of viral latency during herpesvirus infection. acetylation is a more prominent post-translational modification than previously thought. HDACs are a conserved family of proteins that evolutionarily predate histones. they act as components of diverse multi-protein complexes with co-repressor functions. viral interactions with members of this enzymatic family are likely to be protein-specific. the diversity of HDAC-containing complexes was clearly demonstrated by a proteomics-based study that profiled the interactions of all eleven human HDACs. this study demonstrated that HDACs can be part of numerous pre-assembled functional complexes that can associate with transcriptional factors for effective regulation of downstream gene expression. CP8 Redistribution of HDAC1/CoREST and LSD1 to cytoplasm [28,29,30,31] HSV-1 ICP0 Disrupts CoREST association; localizes HDAC1/ICP0 to ND10 bodies [28,32,33,34,35] HSV-1 US3 Upstream effector of HDAC1 phosphorylation [32,36,37] HCMV pUL38 Associates with HDAC1/HDAC2 and NuRD complex HDAC3 HCMV IE1 Increased acetylation at viral promoter [46,47] HCMV IE2 Increased acetylation at viral promoter [46,47] HDAC4 HSV-1 ICP0 Relieves MEF2-binding domain-mediated repression [48] KSHV ORF50 promoter Proposed to modulate promoter acetylation status and LANA acetylation. complex is redistributed to compact structures that also contain the viral protein ICP8. it is possible that the association of separate viral factors could trigger preferential association of specific accessory demethylases with the core CoREST complex. a host defense mechanism against herpesviruses is discussed in section 3.2 of this review. phosphorylation promotes binding to members of co-repressor complexes, including the Sin3a (RbAp48 and mSin3A), NuRD (RbAp48 and MTA2) and CoREST complexes. the activity of viral kinases and perturbations in kinase signaling pathways could alter the phosphorylation landscape of these proteins. CP0 has also been reported to interact with HDAC1 during bovine herpesvirus 1 infection to modulate Mad-dependent transcription. the phosphorylation status of HDACs significantly contributes to the regulation of both protein interactions and localizations in the context of infection. the importance of temporally regulated phosphorylations during viral infection remains to be established. pUL29/28 binds to HDAC1 and MTA1 [39], suggesting preferential association of viral proteins to specific co-repressor complexes. pUL38/pUL29/28/NuRD complex forms early during infection and persists through 72 hpi. pUL29/28 association with nuRD is independent of pUL38 and sufficient for transcriptional activation of the HCMV major immediate early promoter (MIEP) IE1 and IE2 are also known to interact with HDACs to facilitate HCMV replication. IE2 was shown to also interact with HDAC2 [45,46], while IE2 was shown to also interact with HDAC2. promoter were observed to increase during the course of infection (from 6 hpi to 72 hpi) the acetylation at MIEP exhibited a different pattern\u2014increasing at 24 hpi and diminishing at 48 hpi and 72 hpi. however, HDAC-mediated regulation of viral promoter regions appears to be both promoter-specific and temporally regulated. EBNA3C was shown to interact with HDAC1, HDAC2 and the co-repressor complexes mSin3A and NCoR as part of an EBNA3C-ProT complex during EBV infection. a consequence of this interaction is limited production of the immediate early viral protein BLZF1 which is important for exit from latency [60,61]. RF2 complex has been proposed to delay replication initiation from OriP in order to promote the stability of the latent EBV genome. signaling pathways activated by viral infection affect HDAC activities, possibly through signal-dependent post-translational modification. the KSHV protein vGPCR has been reported to induce signaling pathways that converge on HDACs. p53-associated responses to viral infection are due to misregulation of deacetylase complexes. gamma-herpesviruses EBV and KSHV co-opt HDAC complexes to repress viral gene expression. these mechanisms likely allow for maintenance of the viral genome in a latent state until conditions are advantageous for viral replication. phosphorylation is an established regulator of HDAC1 and HDAC2 activity. phosphorylation promotes binding to members of co-repressor complexes, including the Sin3a (RbAp48 and mSin3A), NuRD (RbAp48 and MTA2) and CoREST complexes. class IIa HDACs (HDAC4, -5, -7 and -9) co-localize with ICP0 within the nucleus during HSV-1 infection. phosphorylation status of these proteins significantly contributes to the regulation of both protein interactions and localizations in the context of infection. multiple viral factors, including ICP0, ICP8 and US3, promote changes in the localization and functional roles of HDACs and co-repressor complexes during HSV-1 infection. further investigation of viral protein interactions with HDACs will contribute to development of a comprehensive understanding of the roles of individual HDAC family members during HSV-1 infection. pUL38 interacts with TSC2, a component of the tuberous sclerosis tumor suppressor protein complex (TSC1/2), to maintain an active mTOR pathway during infection. pUL29/28 association with NuRD is independent of pUL38 and sufficient for transcriptional activation of the HCMV major immediate early promoter (MIEP) treatment of cells infected with a pUL29/28-deficient virus with the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA IE2 interaction with HDAC3 is also thought to promote loss of deacetylation at viral promoter regions through a similar mechanism. IE2 has been shown to associate with HDAC2 to de-repress expression from the viral polymerase (pUL54) promoter. HCMV proteins appear to display preference for individual HDAC-containing complexes. association of HDACs with viral promoters further allows modulation of the acetylation status of the viral genome. gamma-herpesviruses EBV and KSHV Regulate HDAC-Containing co-repressor complexes through protein interactions and Phosphorylation-dependent signal cascades. proT is regulated by exploiting class IIa HDAC association with MEF2. the de-phosphorylation of MEF2D has been shown to be important for regulating HDAC-mediated repression of Zp. vGPCR induces expression of the ORF50 promoter. kinases are well-established regulators of nuclear export of class IIa HDACs. vGPCR signaling was reported to reduce the activity of deacetylases. acetylation in defense against herpesviruses is comparable in frequency to phosphorylation. one study alone identified over 3,500 acetylations across three human cells. acetylations within several important effectors of innate immunity. new studies have extended the range of host immuno-surveillance to the nucleus. the DNA sensor IFI16 selectively detects the double-stranded DNA genome of herpesviruses during infection. IFI16 senses cytoplasmic DNA resulting from transfection. acetylation of IFI16 promotes cytoplasmic retention of IFI16. acetylation of Lys99 and Lys128 within the nuclear localization signal promotes cytoplasmic retention of IFI16. acetylation of IFI16 is critical for recognition of nuclear herpesviral DNA during infection. RIG-I activity, acetylation of PRRs and HDAC modulation of PRR activities may be a more prominent regulatory feature of the innate immune system than currently appreciated. animals treated with valproic acid exhibit increased susceptibility to infection by bacterial and fungal pathogens. hDACs are recruited to the viral MIEP promoters by a component of PML bodies to repress viral gene expression at early stages of infection. this mechanism of evading HDAC-mediated anti-viral response appears to be conserved across species. the mouse CMV protein mIE1 is also reported to bind mHDAC3 to ND10 structures via PML and Daxx. viral protein associations with HDACs and HDAC-containing complexes are temporally regulated. downstream targets include genes associated with apoptotic, immune and pro-inflammatory responses. acetylation may be able to positively regulate innate immune signaling pathways. acetylation of NF-B p65/RelA negatively regulates its binding to B-DNA and facilitates its nuclear export. deacetylation of p65/RelA by SIRT1 and SIRT2 limits NF-B activity. these functions are carefully regulated during herpesvirus infection. a novel cancer treatment method has recently been proposed. treatment of HSV-1 infected cells with TSA induces acetylation and nuclear accumulation of NF-B. new evidence suggests NF-B acetylation may be involved in host immune responses. studies examining the functions of the seven mammalian sirtuins during the progression of viral infection are still limited. studies examining the functions of the seven mammalian sirtuins during the progression of viral infection are still limited. this review focuses on the modulation of HDAC complexes during herpesvirus infection. the circadian HAT CLOCK has been shown to be recruited to ND10 bodies and viral replication compartments. it associates with the viral proteins, ICP4, ICP27 and ICP22, and the transcription factor, TFIID [114,115] IFI16 Acetylation and Host Detection of Viral DNA In mammals, induction of host innate immunity in response to viral infection begins with the detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) by intracellular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). inflammasomes recruit and activate caspase-1, which processes pro-inflammatory cytokines pro-IL-1 and pro-IL-18 to their secret, biologically active forms. acetylation of Lys99 and Lys128 within the nuclear localization signal promotes cytoplasmic retention of IFI16, whereas HDAC activity promotes its nuclear import. IFI16 is not the only PRR known to be acetylated during viral infection. acetylation of PRRs and HDAC modulation of PRR activities may be a more prominent regulatory feature of the innate immune system than currently appreciated. cytokine expression does not necessarily correlate with repressive chromatin modifications, as histone H4 acetylation at Tnf and IL6 promoters has been shown to increase following TSA treatment. a significant subset of the immunosuppressive, anti-inflammatory effects of HDAC inhibitors occur at a non-histone level. ICP0 promotes the disruption of HDAC1-CoREST to enhance viral gene expression and replication. increased viral gene expression allows the growing population of ICP0 to outcompete HDAC1 in the binding of CoREST. modification is thought to promote transcriptional activation at interferon-inducible promoters. STAT3 dimerization is modulated by p300-mediated acetylation at Lys685, which promotes nuclear accumulation of STAT3 and transcriptional activation following cytokine-induced signaling. this is in apparent disagreement with global HDAC inhibition studies outlined above. however, recent evidence suggests that the acetylation of STAT1 serves to terminate IFN-induced signaling deacetylation of p65/RelA by SIRT1 and SIRT2 limits NF-B activity. this is achieved through either direct inhibition of NF-B transcriptional activity or promotion of its association with IB. this leads to diminished secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. icular stomatitis virus (VSV) are dependent on the acetylation state of Lys379. the viral protein IE2 can downregulate p53 function through inhibition of the acetyltransferase p300/CBP. it has been proposed that HDAC-1, -2 and -3 can downregulate p53 transcriptional activity. sirtuins possess diverse cellular functions, including modulation of gene expression, DNA repair and apoptosis. sirtuins, like the Zn2+-dependent HDACs, have roles in modulation of herpesvirus lifecycles through protein complex associations and regulation of substrate activities within essential pathways. bICP0 activity is proposed to have a negative effect on establishment of viral latency, instead promoting active lytic replication. the dynamic changes in the composition and activity of HAT complexes induced by interactions with viral proteins indicate that these enzymes, like HDACs, have critical roles during herpesvirus infection. approaches, including metabolomics, proteomics and chemoproteomics, can provide information for comprehensive characterization of the roles that HDACs play during herpesvirus infection. developments in mass spectrometry and bioinformatics have provided powerful tools for quantifying protein levels and defining interactions and post-translational modifications. interaction networks are useful in the development and optimization of statistical methods for characterizing protein associations. proteomic approaches allow for identification of post-translational modifications of both viral and host proteins. a recent proteomic study of HSV-1-infected cells led to the identification of multiple phosphorylation and ubiquitination sites within viral proteins. metabolomics studies following either HCMV or HSV-1 infection have revealed variations in host cell metabolic patterns that correlate with viral growth kinetics [139,141,142,143,144]. HCMV infection induces glycolytic flux to fuel fatty acid biosynthesis, while HSV-1 preferentially stimulates production of components required for pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis."}
