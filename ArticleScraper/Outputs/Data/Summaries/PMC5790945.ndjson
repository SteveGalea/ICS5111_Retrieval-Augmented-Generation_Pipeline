{"summary": "Arenaviruses have a negative-sense, bisegmented RNA genome comprised of two single-stranded segments with an ambisense coding strategy. the small (S) segment encodes the nucleoprotein (NP) and the glycoprotein (GP), while the large (L) segment encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) and the matrix protein Z (9\u201315). GP forms spikes on the exterior of the virion, NP and L together with the genome form the ribonucleoprotein complex. arenaviruses are enveloped and enter cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis. GP triggers fusion of the viral envelope with the endosomal membrane, releasing viral ribonucleoproteins into the cytoplasm. the release of arenavirus virions has traditionally been thought to be mediated by Z's recruitment of the cellular endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) the prototypic Old World arenavirus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) requires both a functional late domain and ESCRT complex for the production of defective interfering particles, but not for infectious virus particles. functional studies identified several host proteins that are required for arenavirus propagation. a functional ESCRT complex is required for the production of infectious JUNV particles. RESULTS Identification of host proteins that associate with the JUNV matrix protein. coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gels of affinity-purified Z protein from cells or VLPs with associated cellular protein partners (B) HEK293T cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding JUNV Z with a C-terminal streptavidin binding peptide (SBP) tag or as a control, an empty vector. two days later, cells and their corresponding VLP-containing supernatants were collected and each gel is representative of two independent experiments. only proteins identified in both replicate experiments for a given condition are listed. plasmid-based expression of Z may miss key interactions. protein gel electrophoresis, in-gel tryptic digestion followed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. in-gel tryptic digestion maximizes the identification of protein partners by first segregating each lane of the protein gel into multiple slices that are all analyzed independently by mass spectrometry. 270 (57%) were conserved across two replicate experiments. arenaviruses are named for the Latin word arenosus meaning \u201csandy\u201d for electron-dense granules, presumed to be ribosomes, that are observed in virions (50). several specific structural domains were enriched in the data set, including WD40 repeats, HEAT repeats, and FERM domains. a variety of nuclear import or export factors were overrepresented in VLPs, as well as cells. an interactome map of host proteins identified as components of JUNV C#1 virions or partners of JUNV Z was generated using Cytoscape 3.3.0 software. only host proteins identified in both replicate experiments are shown. lines link each host protein to the condition (circular nodes) in which it was identified. complex, beta polypeptide (ATP5B), ATPase, H+ transporting, lysosomal 38-kDa, V0 subunit d1 (ATP6V0D1), IMP dehydrogenase 2 (IMPDH2), peroxiredoxin 3 (PRDX3), and Rab5c. RAB5C, member RAS oncogene family x Filovirus (92), herpes simplex virus (106), HIV-1 (107), vaccinia virus (113), vesicular stomatitis virus (62) to validate that the selected host proteins interact with JUNV. we affinity purified cell-free JUNV C#1 particles or JUNV Z from cells or VLPs. the LCMV Z expression levels in the experiment were lower than the levels of LASV Z or JUNV Z. the lower levels of ATP5B and IMPDH2 detected with LCMV Z are more likely due to the smaller quantity of LCMV Z available to be captured during affinity purification. to validate the presence of ARF1 and Rab5c in virions, we immunoprecipitated C#1 virions. HEK293T cells were infected with JUNV C#1 and 72 h later, virus particles were immunoprecipitated using an antibody specific for the viral envelope glycoprotein (GP1) all proteins were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and chemiluminescence-based detection with standard film. molecular mass in kDa is shown to the left of each gel. we wished to determine whether the selected host proteins were functionally required for JUNV C#1 or LCMV replication. this was accomplished by knocking down the expression of each host protein using silencing RNAs (small interfering RNAs [siRNAs]. VLP release was reduced 69% following ATP5B knockdown and 76% with IMPDH2 knockdown, indicating both of these proteins impact the release of JUNV. human lung carcinoma (A549) cells were reverse transfected with a nontargeting siRNA (siNEG) or with the indicated gene-specific siRNAs (siTARGET) ATP5B and IMPDH2 are required for efficient JUNV budding. a second set of siRNAs targeting ATP5B and IMPDH2 was used to confirm the requirement of these proteins in JUNV infection. the cells and supernatants were collected 48 h later. the importance of the cellular ESCRT pathway for infectious virus production has not been addressed previously. the current study identified 14 ESCRT complex or ESCRT-associated proteins in Z VLPs or JUNV C#1 virions under at least one experimental condition. tetracycline-based induction of GFP-tagged WT or dominant-negative mutant (EQ) vacuolar protein sorting 4A (VPS4A) or VPS4B was infected with JUNV C#1 at an MOI of 0.1 (A) or rLCMV WT at an MOI of 0.001 (B) 5 hours after induction, cells were washed and fresh tetracycline-containing medium was added. complexes were separated by gel electrophoresis and then subjected to in-gel digestion. the resultant peptides were then analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. 69 of these proteins were identified in both experiments. hek293T cells were infected with JUNV C#1 and virus particles were immunoprecipitated using an antibody specific for the viral envelope glycoprotein (GP1) control conditions included (i) immunoprecipitation of virus-containing supernatants with a nonspecific mouse (Ms) IgG antibody and (ii) immunoprecipitation of an uninfected supernatant. a total of 476 host proteins were identified in JUNV virions. 270 (57%) were conserved across two replicate experiments. a total of 476 host proteins were identified in JUNV virions. a total of 918 host proteins were identified in at least one replicate experiment as associating with JUNV Z in host cells or VLPs. a total of 918 host proteins were identified in at least one replicate experiment as associating with JUNV Z in host cells or VLPs. intracellular Z interacted with several ATP synthases and ATPases. several virion-associated host proteins were also found to associate with intracellular Z, suggesting that Z may play a role in recruiting these cellular proteins into virions. the gene functional classification tool in DAVID version 6.7 was used to identify the most highly enriched biological function categories. list of proteins identified in this study was cross-referenced with published data from genome-scale RNA interference (RNAi) screening for required host factors for different viruses. included human immunodeficiency virus (51\u201353), dengue virus (54, 55), hepatitis C virus (56, 57), influenza virus (58\u201361), and vesicular stomatitis virus (62). ase, H+ transporting, mitochondrial F1 complex, beta polypeptide x x HIV-1 (107) HIV (53) ATP6V0D1 9114 ATPase, H+ transporting, lysosomal 38 kDa, V0 subunit d1 x HIV-1 (107), Moloney murine leukemia virus (110) Dengue virus (54, 55), Hendra virus (111), influenza A virus (59, 61, 65), LC a total of 15 Rab family proteins were identified as JUNV Z protein partners or in JUNV C#1 virions in at least one replicate mass spectrometry experiment. however, only three of the Rab proteins (Rab1a, Rab7a, and Rab10) were identified in both replicate experiments. HEK293T cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding the SBP-tagged Z protein of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), Lassa virus (LASV) or an empty vector to serve as a control. two days later, cells and their VLP-containing supernatants were collected and lysed to liberate each respective host protein and its host protein partners. Western blot analysis using antibodies specific for the JUNV proteins GP1, NP, and Z. all proteins were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. chemiluminescence-based detection with standard film. loss of expression of ATP5B, ATP6V0D1, or PRDX3 significantly impaired JUNV C#1 propagation. LCMV also required ATP5B and IMPDH2 for efficient propagation, but not ARF1, ATP6V0D1, or PRDX3. sates were probed for cellular actin and either JUNV C#1 NP (B) or LCMV NP (C) by Western blotting. values are shown as percentages of the virus titer under the nontargeting control siRNA condition. ATP5B and IMPDH2 are required for efficient JUNV budding. in cells and virus-like particle (VLP)-containing supernatants were determined by fluorescent Western blotting. the VLP release efficiency was calculated as the amount of Z in the supernatants divided by the quantity of intracellular Z. compared to cells expressing WT VPS4A or VPS4B, there was a significant impairment in the release of infectious LCMV virions. however, the release of infectious LCMV virions was not affected by VPS4A EQ or VPS4B EQ expression (P values of 0.98 or 0.98, respectively), which is in agreement with previous results. titers represent the mean values SEM of 3 independent experiments. n.s., not significant; **, P 0.01. DISCUSSION Viruses hijack host machinery to complete the various stages of their life cycles. 5-ethynyl-1--d-ribofuranosylimidazole-4-carboxamide (EICAR) treatment inhibits arenavirus production (63) this finding could indicate that arenaviruses recruit IMPDH2 as a means to support the processes of genome replication and transcription. however, IMPDH2 depletion inhibits JUNV VLP release. several vesicular trafficking proteins, including members of the Ras superfamily, were enriched in Z VLPs and/or JUNV virions. a parallel siRNA screen found ARF1 necessary for optimal LCMV propagation, suggesting that it may be broadly important for arenavirus infection (62). the presence of Rab proteins in virions suggests that some of these Rab proteins may have a role in late steps of the virus life cycle (i.e., assembly and budding) the presence of Rab proteins in virions suggests that some of these Rab proteins may have a role in late steps of the virus life cycle. the arenavirus matrix protein drives the budding and release of virus particles at the plasma membrane (17, 41, 42) ESCRT-I complexes are thought to be involved in the recruitment of ESCRT-I complexes. ESCRT proteins, including the ESCRT-I proteins TSG101 and VPS28, as well as the ESCRT accessory protein VPS4B, have been identified in virions of other viruses containing the P(T/S)AP late domain. Knockdown of ESCRT-I protein TSG101 results in decreased VLP production for LCMV and LASV (17, 42), but not Lujo virus (41, 47, 94). LCMV uses the ESCRT complex specifically for defective interfering particle production but not the release of infectious virus (44). this indicates that VLP assays may not always faithfully recapitulate all the facets of infection or, alternatively, reflect the biology of budding for specific classes of virus particles. study highlights the role that the ESCRT pathway plays in driving infectious JUNV particle release. the data set reported here will aid in the identification of novel host targets that can be therapeutically targeted. human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T/17) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) human lung carcinoma cells (A549) were maintained in 50:50 DMEM\u2013F-12 medium. all cell lines were grown at 37\u00b0C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2.
