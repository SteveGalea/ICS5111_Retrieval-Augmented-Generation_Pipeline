{"summary": "Nipah virus (NiV) can cause severe acute and often lethal respiratory illness and/or encephalitis in humans and animals. there are no approved vaccines or therapeutics for human use. since 2001, NiV outbreaks have occurred almost yearly in Bangladesh and India. both NiV-M and NiV-B were isolated from human respiratory secretions. ciliated and non-ciliated cells are permissive to both NiV-M and NiV-B infection. the phenotype of cells present in the B- and S-ALI cultures was characterized. cross-section of B-ALI (a) and S-ALI (b) resembling a pseudostratified columnar and simple cuboidal respiratory-like epithelium. cross-section of B-ALI (a) and S-ALI (b) resembling a pseudostratified columnar and simple cuboidal respiratory-like epithelium, respectively. NiV-B and NiV-M virus titres peaked respectively at days 5 and 8 p.i. at a low m.o.i. in B-ALI, NiV-B replicated to significantly higher titres by day 7 p.i. compared with NiV-M. peak titres were about 1 log higher for NiV-B compared with NiV-M. NiV-B replication in B- and S-ALI at a high and low infective dose. results are expressed as the mean of three repetitions with the standard deviation. NiV-B-infected (d) ciliated cells (virus in green, cilia in magenta), (e) Clara cells (virus in green, CC10 protein in magenta) and (f) goblet cells (virus in green, Mucin5AC protein in magenta). NiV-B and NiV-B induce a similar innate immune response in B- and S-ALI. the largest increases in cytokine/chemokine secretion levels due to NiV infection were observed for fractalkine, IL-6 in S-ALI (P 0.001), MCP-1 in B-ALI (P 0.001) and CXCL-10 in both B- and S-ALI (P 0.001) when compared with controls. results suggest that NiV-M and NiV-B induce a comparable pro-inflammatory response in the tracheal/bronchial epithelium recombinant human cytokines/chemokines were assessed for monocyte chemotactic activity. no increase of monocyte migration was observed in the mixtures similar to the basal side of NiV-M- or NiV-B-infected B-ALI compared with that in control S-ALI. however, an equivalent increase of migrated monocytes occurred in the mixtures derived from the basal side of NiV-M- and NiV-B-infected S phenotype of cells present in the B- and S-ALI cultures was characterized. B- and S-ALI cultures consisted of pseudostratified columnar and simple cuboidal respiratory-like epithelium. only B-ALI contained both Clara secretory cells and goblet cells. cross sections showing cilia from ciliated cells in B-ALI (a) and S-ALI (d), CC10 protein from Clara cells in B-ALI (b) and S-ALI (e), and Mucin5AC from goblet cells in B-ALI (c). no staining of Mucin5AC in S-ALI (f). cell nuclei in blue. Magnification 40. Bars, 10 m. NiV-M and NiV-B replicate in B- both NiV-B and NiV-M virus titres reached a maximum as early as day 3\u20134 p.i. but peak titres were about 1 log higher for NiV-B compared with NiV-M. at a low m.o.i. in S-ALI, NiV-B replicated with a higher titre compared with NiV-M. NiV-M and NiV-B infected all three cell types as observed in B-ALI. results suggest that NiV-M and NiV-B have the same tropism for differentiated epithelial cells from the human lower respiratory tract. only the secretion levels of fractalkine, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), IL-6, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP-1) and chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) were significantly increased by NiV-M and NiV-B infection. overall, the baseline cytokine levels were higher in non-infected S-ALI compared with B-ALI. NiV-M-infected (black) and NiV-B-infected (grey) B- and S-ALI at day 7 p.i. cytokines/chemokines secreted in B- and S-ALI were tested for monocyte chemotactic activity. the increased concentrations of fractalkine and IL-6 were enough to recruit more monocytes (P 0.01). the small airway epithelium proximal to the alveoli can recruit monocytes via fractalkine and IL-6 secretion in response to NiV-M and NiV-B infection. way epithelium cultured at an air\u2013liquid interface was used to investigate NiV-M and NiV-B cell tropism, virus replication and virus-induced immune response in epithelium of the lower respiratory tract proximal to the alveoli. the small airway epithelium proximal to the alveoli is populated at more than 50 % by ciliated cells and by a large proportion of secretory cells that are mostly Clara cells. ciliated, goblet and Clara cells were susceptible to NiV-M and NiV-B. both strains replicated efficiently in S-ALI whereas NiV-B replicated significantly faster and to a higher titre than NiV-M. in depth comparison will be required using cultures from multiple donors. a reduced number of these inflammatory mediators also had increased concentration levels in NiV-M- and NiV-B-infected B- and S-ALI cultures. the strongest inflammation occurs in the small airway epithelium due to much higher levels of IL-6, CXCL10, G-CSF and fractalkine than in the tracheal/bronchial epithelium. this is supported by the fact that increased secretion levels of these mediators were previously reported in NiV-M-infected lung grafts. monocyte chemotaxis occurred by cytokines and chemokines induced during NiV-M- and NiV-B-infection in S-ALI, but not in B-ALI samples. this suggests that the small airway respiratory epithelium proximal to alveoli is itself prone to recruit immune cells such as monocytes that will eventually differentiate into macrophages due to inflammation. both NiV-M and NiV-B infected the same cell types in B- and S-ALI. a high level of NiV replication in B-ALI suggests that the human tracheal epithelium is an opportune location for early replication, aerosolization and shedding of infectious virus particles. this is consistent with the fact that human-to-human transmission was reported during the outbreak in 2004 in Bangladesh. normal human bronchial epithelial cells were delivered ready to use. all cells originated from biopsies in two healthy donors. both models were checked for cilia expression and beating. fluorescence microscopy Cells on inserts were fixed using 4 % paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 48 h, then for 24 h with fresh 4 % PFA before transfer to the BSL2 for paraffin embedding and sectioning. sections were then processed and imaged with an Evos XL core when haematoxylin and eosin staining was used. primary antibodies against ciliated cells (mouse anti-al fixed samples were washed in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, post-fixed in 1 % OsO4 in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.3), dehydrated in ethanol and processed through hexamethyldisilazane. filters were detached, mounted onto the specimen stubs and sputter-coated with iridium in an Emitech K575x sputter coater at 20 mA for 20 s 1.6 106 THP-1 monocytes per sample were washed twice with serum-free RPMI 1640, warmed to 37 \u00b0C, and plated in the top chamber of an 8 m transwell. each transwell insert was then placed into a bottom chamber containing 500 l of either serum-free RPMI 1640 (negative control), serum-free RPMI 1640 with mixtures of recombinant human cytokines and chemokines. all data are presented in figures as means sd (*P 0.05, **P 0.01, ***P 0.001) each condition was performed with biological triplicates. NiV-M was isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of a patient exhibiting respiratory involvement during the 2004 outbreak in Rajbari district, Bangladesh. the m.o.i. was calculated based on the number of cells originally used to seed the inserts. the apical side of inserts was rinsed three times with 200 l of 1 PBS. each condition was performed with biological triplicates. rhodamine red goat anti-mouse antibody detected using rabbit anti-NiV-nucleoprotein antibody. DAPI staining was added to visualize cell nuclei. fixed samples were washed in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, post-fixed in 1 % OsO4 in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer. samples were inactivated on dry ice by gamma irradiation (5 Mrad) the assays were performed according to manufacturer's instructions. 1.6 106 THP-1 monocytes per sample were washed twice with serum-free RPMI 1640. each transwell insert was then placed into a bottom chamber containing 500 l of serum-free RPMI 1640. chemokines and cytokine tested included G-CSF, GM-CSF, fractalkine, IL-6, MCP-1 and CXCL10. monocytes were allowed to migrate for 3 h at 37 \u00b0C in the bottom chamber."}
