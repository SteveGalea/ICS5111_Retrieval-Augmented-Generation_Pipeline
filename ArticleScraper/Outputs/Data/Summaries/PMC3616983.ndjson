{"summary": "the underlying shell of the developing viral particle is formed by the Pr55Gag polyprotein (Gag), which is translated deep within the cytoplasm of cells. the underlying shell of the developing viral particle is formed by the Pr55Gag polyprotein (Gag), which is translated deep within the cytoplasm of cells. lentiviral particles incorporate a very limited number of envelope proteins. a total understanding of how the CT mediates incorporation onto budding virions remains elusive. a complete understanding of how the CT mediates incorporation onto budding virions remains elusive. the limitation to virion Env incorporation is cytoplasmic tail-dependent. the limited number of Env trimers on HIV-1 particles suggested that there is an inherent limitation to Env incorporation that is unrelated to the production of Env protein in the cell. v observed in these experiments was particle-associated. despite the ability to incorporate Env at higher levels upon overexpression, particles bearing CT144 Env were consistently less infectious as measured using TZM-bl indicator cells. infectivity is plotted as number of blue cells per nanogram of p24 antigen used in the infection assay. depletion of Rab11a or Rab11b did not significantly diminish Env on particles. overexpression of the active, GTP-bound form of Rab11a (Rab11a S20V) diminished cellular and particle-associated Env. cellular levels of gp160 were not altered by FIP1C depletion. particle-associated Env was markedly lower. both gp120 and gp41 levels were diminished, suggesting a defect in Env heterotrimer incorporation. the striking effect of FIP1C depletion on Env incorporation suggested to us that it might be an essential cofactor for Env trafficking and particle incorporation. however, to rule out off-target effects, we next restored cellular levels of FIP1C using an shRNA-resistant GFP-tagged FIP1C cDNA. the small amount of incorporated CT144 Env was not altered by FIP1C depletion. the effect of FIP1C depletion on HIV-1 Env incorporation was specific for HIV, as no effect on particle infectivity was observed for viruses pseudotyped with VSV-G or the amphotropic murine leukemia virus. the relative level of Env on plasma membrane compared to total Env was calculated and plotted in panel (D) for control and FIP1C-depleted H9 cells. FIP1C-depleted (open circles) and control shRNA-treated H9 cells were infected with VSV-pseudotyped viruses indicated at MOI 0.5. wildtype NL4-3 replicated well in H9 cells that had been transduced with control shRNA. depletion of FIP1C resulted in markedly delayed and slow replication of NL4-3. at late timepoints, this virus was able to replicate more efficiently. this was associated with higher levels of FIP1C that developed in the H9 population over time. transfection of NL4-3delCT144 provirus retained the perinuclear distribution of GFP-FIP1C. differences in redistribution of FIP1C out of the perinuclear location were scored by a blinded observer. we also tested if HIV-1 Env protein alone redistributes FIP1C using same method described above and plotted the result in (F). to reconcile how a Rab11a-binding protein acting as an adaptor could modulate Env incorporation in a Rab11a-independent manner, we investigated the involvement of Rab14 in Env incorporation. GFP-FIP1C(592\u2013649) retains the Rab11-binding domain. however, the localization with Rab14 was markedly attenuated. these results suggest that Rab14 may not be associating with the Rab11-binding domain. cells were fixed and stained for endogenous Rab14 (red) and Rab11a (blue) to evaluate further binding requirements for Rab14 with FIP1C. we mutated two residues from FIP1C to those matching the sequence in FIP2 to create FIP1C(S580N/S582L) constitutively-active Rab14(Q70L) expression had opposite effect. results supported an important role for Rab14 in HIV-1 Env incorporation. in the absence of FIP1C, the enhancement of particle-incorporated Env was not observed. input plasmid levels were 2 g in lanes 3, 5, 7 and 8 and increased to 4 g in lanes 4 and 6. gp160 and gp120 were detected with polyclonal antiserum. gp41 particle blots were probed with a monoclonal specific for gp41. compared head-to-head, FIP1C(I621E) was not able to rescue Env particle incorporation (Fig. 6C, lane 7) while FIP1C(D622N) was competent for rescue (Fig. 6C, lane 8). a specific Rab14/FIP1C complex mediates intracellular trafficking and particle incorporation of the HIV-1 Env glycoprotein complex. we depleted FIP1C in primary MDMs from two donors. we then infected the cells with NL4-3 or NL4-3delCT144. gp41 and gp120 particle incorporation was markedly lower than wildtype NL4-3. the bottom Env immunoblot represents cell surface Env as determined by biotinylation and precipitation with streptavidin beads. Env and Gag content of released viral particles was quantified by densitometry using the LiCor instrument and plotted as background-subtracted Env pixel intensity to Gag pixel intensity. the limitation to virion Env incorporation is cytoplasmic tail-dependent. the limited number of Env trimers on HIV-1 particles suggested to us that there is an inherent limitation to Env incorporation that is unrelated to the production of Env protein in the cell. a plateau in particle infectivity conferred by WT Env was noted at the same level of Env expression found to be saturating by Western blot or ELISA analysis. the incorporation of Env onto HIV-1 particles is saturable in a cytoplasmic tail-dependent fashion. depletion of Rab11a or Rab11b did not significantly diminish Env on particles. overexpression of the active, GTP-bound form of Rab11a (Rab11a S20V) diminished cellular and particle-associated Env. gp160 levels were not altered by FIP1C depletion, while particle-associated Env was markedly lower. both gp120 and gp41 levels were diminished, suggesting a defect in Env heterotrimer incorporation. Fig. 2C demonstrates that FIP1C depletion and not transduction with a scrambled shRNA vector depleted cellular FIP1C levels. expression of FIP1C cDNA with silent mutations rendering it resistant to shRNA-mediated depletion was able to fully restore the incorporation of Env onto HIV-1 particles. CT144 Env was not altered by FIP1C depletion. the effect of FIP1C depletion on HIV-1 Env incorporation was specific for HIV. NL4-3delCT144 particle infectivity was not altered. the relative level of Env on plasma membrane compared to total Env was calculated and plotted in panel (D) for control and FIP1C-depleted H9 cells. no significant effect on cell surface levels of CT144 Env was observed following FIP1C depletion. cytoplasmic tail-truncated virus was observed in H9 cells. wildtype NL4-3 replicated well in H9 cells that had been transduced with control shRNA. this resulted in markedly delayed and slow replication of NL4-3. at late timepoints, this virus was able to replicate more efficiently. the differences in redistribution of FIP1C out of the perinuclear location were scored by a blinded observer. the experiment was repeated with expression of WT Env and CT144 Env alone. the results suggest a CT-dependent outward movement of FIP1C. Rab14 has recently been identified as a Rab11-FIP binding protein [27]. these investigators had suggested that Rab14 might interact with the Rab binding domain of multiple Rab11-FIP proteins. however, we did not find any interaction with FIP2 (Supplemental Table S1 in Text S1). the localization with Rab11a was markedly attenuated. these results suggested that Rab14 may not be associating with the Rab11-binding domain as suggested by Kelly at al. (2010). compared the association of Rab14 with the dominant negative trafficking mutant GFP-FIP2(129\u2013512) we mutated two residues from FIP1C to those matching the sequence in FIP2 to create FIP1C(S580N/S582L) this double mutation in the context of GFP-FIP1C(560\u2013649) elicited a loss of colocalization with Rab14. the region proximal to the Rab11-binding domain in FIP1C is responsible for association with Rab14. Rab14 interaction with FIP1C is required for incorporation of full-length HIV-1 Env onto particles. in the absence of FIP1C, the enhancement of particle-incorporated Env was not observed. gp160 and gp120 were detected with polyclonal antiserum. gp41 particle blots were probed with a monoclonal specific for gp41. to evaluate further the role of Rab14 on Env incorporation, we depleted Rab14 or Rab11a in HeLa cells. compared head-to-head, FIP1C(I621E) was not able to rescue Env particle incorporation (Fig. 6C, lane 7) while FIP1C(D622N) was competent for rescue (Fig. 6C, lane 8). we interpret this to mean that mislocalized I621E does not reach the ERC, and subsequently cannot direct outward sorting of Env. depletion of FIP1C in MDMs significantly diminished gp41 and gp120 particle incorporation. these data indicate that FIP1C is required for CT-dependent incorporation of Env onto HIV particles in MDMs as it is in T cell lines and HeLa cells. the bottom Env immunoblot represents cell surface Env as determined by biotinylation and precipitation with streptavidin beads. p24 and gp120 antigen-capture ELISA calculated as background-subtracted Env pixel intensity to Gag pixel intensity. the number of Env molecules per particle was calculated as an approximation. Pseudotyping of viruses or virus-like particles has revealed both specific and non-specific mechanisms of Env incorporation. HIV-1 can form infectious particles with Env proteins from a wide variety of retroviral subfamilies, including alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-. the specificity of HIV-1 Env incorporation could be due to direct interactions with MA, to indirect Gag-Env interactions mediated by an intermediate host protein. the Rab11-FIPs play important roles in the recycling of cargo from the recycling system to the cell surface. all family members possess a carboxyl-terminal alpha-helical Rab11-binding domain (RBD) the RBD of the FIPs forms a parallel coiled-coil homodimer that interacts with switch 1 and switch 2 regions of the GTP-bound form of Rab11a. this results indicate that FIP1C has multiple binding domains for small GTPases. in support of this, we found that the GTP-bound form of Rab14(Q70L) actually enhanced the amount of particle-associated Env, while dominant-negative Rab14(S25N) diminished Env incorporation in a dose-dependent fashion. in support of this, we found that the constitutively-active Rab11a(S20V) construct diminished Env incorporation in a dose-dependent fashion. together, our results support a complex of GTP-bound Rab14 and FIP the nature of the assembly microdomain in which assembly occurs may differ between cell types such as HeLa cells and H9 cells. exclusion of truncated Env from this microdomain in H9 cells and lack of exclusion in HeLa. peripheral blood obtained from healthy volunteers according to protocol approved by the Emory University Institutional Review Board. written informed consent was obtained from donors, and samples were de-identified prior to handling by laboratory personnel. amphotropic MLV Env expression vector pCL-Ampho was from Inder Verma [56] pCL-ampho was from inder verma [56] pCL-ampho was from inder verma [26], [59]. pCL-ampho was from Sigma (V5507) and anti-amphotropic MLV goat antiserum (679) was obtained from Beckman Coulter (Fullerton, CA, USA). rabbit anti-Rab11a (8H10) was described previously by the Goldenring laboratory. mouse monoclonal anti-Rab11a (8H10) was described previously by the Goldenring laboratory. images of endogenous Rab11 and Rab14 together with GFP-FIP1C were obtained.
