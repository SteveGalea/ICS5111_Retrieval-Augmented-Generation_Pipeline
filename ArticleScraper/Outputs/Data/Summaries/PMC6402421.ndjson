{"summary": "porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) is the causative agent of neurological and/or digestive disease in pigs. PHEV remains among the least studied of the swine coronaviruses because of its low clinical prevalence. the overall diameter of coVs can range from 60 to 160 nm. the phospholipids and glycolipids incorporated into the virus envelope are derived from the host cell cellular membranes. most coVs have a single layer of club-shaped spikes (S protein) 12\u201325 nm in length. a large surface spike glycoprotein (S; 180\u2013200 kDa) visible as the corona, a small membrane protein (E; 8\u201310 kDa), a transmembrane glycoprotein (M; 20\u201330 kDa) and a nucleocapsid protein (N; 50\u201360 kDa) the differences in the number, type, and sizes of the structural proteins are responsible for significant structural differences of the nucleocapsids a small region of the PHEV S protein interacts with the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) expressed on the surface of the neurons (22), playing a role during the infection of PHEV neurons (23). the protein E amino acid sequence is highly conserved among coVs. the soluble N protein is composed of two independent N- and C-terminal RNA-binding domains (1). hemagglutinin-esterases (HEs) are also found in influenza C, toroviruses, and coVs, likely because of relatively recent lateral gene transfer events. five swine coVs have been identified, including TGEV, first described in 1946 (37); PHEV, isolated in 1962 (38); porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), isolated in 1977 (39); porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), a spike (S) gene deletion mutant of TGEV. a bat-HKU2-like Alphacoronavirus has been identified in swine in china (45, 46) the alphacoronavirus PRCV infects the upper respiratory tract, trachea, tonsils, or lungs. the betacoronavirus PHEV produces vomiting and wasting disease (VWD) and/or encephalomyelitis. old piglets showing histopathological evidence of viral polioencephalomyelitis were reported in 4 weeks old piglets from the same farms. viral diagnosis was based on three criteria: formation of multinucleated giant cells in PK cells, hemagglutination of chicken erythrocytes in culture fluids, and inhibition of hemagglutination in hyper-immune anti-serum. PHEV can infect nave pigs of any age, but clinical disease, morbidity, and mortality are age-dependent. pigs can be infected vertically from sows to neonates or by comingling at weaning. a serological survey was performed on farms with different grades of biosecurity in argentina. a total of 961 serum samples collected from 14 breeding herds were evaluated. the overall seroprevalence was 41.62% (CI 3.12). in 2006 a VWD outbreak with motor disorders and high mortality was reported for the first time in argentina. clinical disease PHEV can infect nave pigs of any age, but is variable and dependent on age, possible differences in virus virulence (74) and the course of viral pathogenesis. the role of PHEV as respiratory pathogen has not yet been confirmed. pigs inoculated oronasally or via the infraorbital nerve showed signs of VWD 5 days after the inoculation. a high percentage of animals inoculated intravenously showed VWD signs 3 days after the inoculation. pigs between 5 and 7 week old severely wasted and poor body condition. mortality is variable, reaching up to 100% in neonatal litters born from PHEV nave dams. piglets without lactogenic immunity against PHEV may approach 100% when the infection occurs near birth. sneezing, coughing, and vomiting may continue intermittently for 1\u20132 days. pigs may have a jerky gait and walk backwards, ending in a dog-sitting position. blindness, opisthotonus, and nystagmus may also occur. immunofluorescence testing revealed that epithelial cells of nasal mucosa, tonsils, lungs, and some unidentified cells in the small intestine can be infected. PHEV can spread from the primary sites of replication through the peripheral nervous system to the central nervous system. swine is the only species susceptible to PHEV natural infection. mice (80, 86\u201391) and rats (92, 93) have been used as an alternative animal model for PHEV pathogenesis investigation. PHEV viral particles were found in peripheral axons and trans-synaptic spread between neurons through endo- and exocytosis. PHEV is involved in post-transcriptional regulation, and contributed to central nervous system dysfunction by spatiotemporal control of host microRNAs. more recent studies in mice demonstrated that PHEV is involved in post-transcriptional regulation. post mortem examination in a 5 week old pig showed severe gastric distention associated with abundant ingesta (54) piglets showed a non-suppurative viral-type encephalomyelitis, characterized by lymphoplasmacytic perivascular cuffing. mononuclear cells' infiltration in the gray matter of the cerebrum and neuronal degeneration. neuronal degeneration and necrosis in trigeminal ganglia associated with severe lymphoplasmacytic infiltration. methods for the direct detection of PHEV in the tissues of clinically affected animals include immunohistochemistry in sections of the brain, spinal cord and myenteric plexus. RT-PCR was used to describe and compare the patterns of PHEV shedding and the dynamic of the infection in pen-based oral fluids collected from grow-finishers between 1 and 28 days post-inoculation (DPI) and feces between 1 and 10 DPI. previous reports indicated that viremia had little effect during the infection. non-porcine cell culture has been shown to have little susceptibility to PHEV growth (112, 114) PHEV can grow in mice's brain cells, dorsal root ganglia cells and in madin-darby canine kidney cells without prior adaptation. titer nor SN titers can be used for PHEV serodiagnosis or to assess degrees of antigenic relationship between isolates. PHEV is highly prevalent, circulating subclinically in most swine herds. the development of specific monoclonal antibodies against PHEV has also been reported. pigs develop a detectable circulating antibody response to PHEV. the immune response against PHEV has been recently characterized in grow-finisher pigs under experimental conditions. intravenous or intraperitoneal administration of PHEV antiserum provided partial protection against PHEV infection. PHEV persists endemically in most breeding farms by pig-to-pig transmission and subclinical infections with colonization of the upper respiratory tract. PHEV-related disease is a concern mainly in litter of young gilts that may not have been previously exposed to PHEV. PHEV should be considered a major source of economic loss. high mortality on farms with high gilt replacement rates, specific pathogen-free animals, and gnotobiotic swine herds may also be at risk of high piglet mortality because of PHEV."}
