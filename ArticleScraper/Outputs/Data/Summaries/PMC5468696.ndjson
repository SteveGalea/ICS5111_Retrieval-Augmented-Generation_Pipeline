{"summary": "world health authorities have documented the emergence or re-emergence, and spread, regionally and/or globally, of emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) these EIDs have included Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), some forms of malaria, bacterial food-borne diseases, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Q fever, influenzas (H1N1, H5N1), Ebola, Nipah and West Nile virus disease. a 1992 report by the Institute of Medicine in the u.s. suggested that drivers of EIDs included human demographics and behaviour; technology and industry; economic development and land use; international travel and commerce; microbial adaptation and change and breakdown of public health measures. the review made no mention of initiatives to change global policies on such issues. integrative responses Despite good intentions, substantive links have been slow to emerge. some health researchers and professionals have attempted to integrate them into broad, systemic models, processes and frameworks. each of these integrative initiatives grew out of distinct scholarly cultures, each with their own languages, dialects, cultures and conferences. despite successes in disease control, some of the major drivers of EIDs have worsened. advocates for managing social determinants, ecological resilience, biodiversity and environmental conservation have had little success in influencing relevant national and international policies. some might argue that EIDs are the products of an over-populated, over-consuming world. stumbling partial successes of many global responses to EIDs can be attributed to the deification of certain biomedical, natural science and organizational narratives. the path to success achieved by, race-horse-like, wearing blinders, peripheral vision (awareness of context) is denigrated as irrelevant and theories and values are assumed and poorly understood. some researchers attempted to create more complicated mathematical models. problems arise in situations that can be defined from a variety of seemingly incompatible perspectives. solving one part of a wicked problem may exacerbate other parts of health. the disciplines most familiar with investigating complex eco-social phenomena are often dismissed as \u2018soft\u2019, \u2018poor cousins\u2019 to the natural and biomedical sciences. the so-called \u2018soft\u2019 disciplines suffer from neglect because, compared to natural sciences, they are much more technically and ethically challenging. some literary analogies would be novels focused on a single character (a virus, person), those focused on family dynamics (outbreak level) 'science is bereft of deontology: it cannot tell why one should be interested in science or anything else' argues the fundamental point here is that all researchers and practitioners frame their work in such a way that it accords with their personal values. the notion that \u2018truths\u2019 can change depending on context and narrative seems \u2018soft\u2019 and anti-scientific. one health advocates may articulate what appear to be globally held values. if the One World is understood as one gigantic complicated system, a computer perhaps, then \u2018problems\u2019 such as EIDs are seen to be merely technical, solved by more data, innovations in technology and deft or aggressive organizational footwork. the wild male jungle fowl is a magnificent bird, his wattles full, fleshy, his pink cape flowing from the crown, over his back, in brilliant bronze, rust and gold. the wild male jungle fowl, primary progenitor of the world's domestic poultry, is a magnificent bird, his wattles full, fleshy, his pink cape flowing from the crown, over his back, in brilliant bronze, rust and gold. large-scale duck farms are reported as early as the fifth century bc. large-scale duck farms are reported as early as the fifth century bc. the intestines of waterfowl are the primordial home for all 16 known subtypes of the influenza A virus. in 1961, the world population of domestic chickens numbered about four billion. by 2013, that number had grown to about 20 billion chickens. in the twenty-first century, chickens are being grown, trucked, shipped and fried as fast as technology allows. the dominance of this kind of science coincided with, and was driven by, the narrative of industrialization and progress. economies of specialization and scale suggested that a \u2018chicken in every pot\u2019 might be achieved by putting many thousands of birds into very large barns, with genetic, feed and housing inputs manufactured in separate factories. the emergence of diseases associated with such agents as H5N1 and salmonellosis is not surprising, if viewed through a lens of complexity. the emergence of diseases associated with such agents as H5N1 and salmonellosis is not, if viewed through a lens of complexity,. 'Problems' associated with human labour have sometimes been avoided in poultry production largely by replacing low-paid people with computer systems. this prevents the H1N1 effect but has other unintended consequences. Economies of scale in poultry production require large, climate-controlled barns, which require a stable, low-cost source of energy. industrial poultry production is responsible for high rates of food-borne infection. levels of Campylobacter contamination of poultry carcasses is so high that in 2015 the UK Food Standards Agency recommended that consumer should not wash raw chicken. over-application of chicken manure on land in the USA has led to runoff into nearby waterways, and explosive outbreaks of the toxic dinoflagellate Pfiesteria piscicida. a highly contagious strain of H5N1 can now be reached in only a few mutations. it could allow airborne transmission between mammals and in this way trigger a major pandemic. this strain already exists thanks to laboratory scientists at university of Wisconsin-Madison. the side effects have had the effect of accentuating evidence-based counter-narratives, inequalities in the system, magnifying environmental impacts and shifting economic and disease risks from agribusiness owners to farmers and consumers. agribusinesses require low-cost energy and feed sources and/or low-paid labour. eric liu: pandemics can be understood and managed by studying pieces separately. liu: we need to re-imagine the world in deeper, more complex, more evidence-based ecosystem terms. he says the real costs of producing low-cost chicken are being paid in subsidies to fossil fuels and corn, in lost biodiversity in Brazil and in the oceans. liu: we need to re-imagine the world in deeper, more complex, more evidence-based the alternative narratives should be seen as essential elements in a globally sustainable programme that accommodates food security, health (in its broad WHO definition) and ecological resilience. a way forward Acknowledging the alternative narratives requires that one acknowledge as well that one is faced with trade-offs and continual tensions. science at its best is a way to share experience, to offer and evaluate alternative explanations, to project future possibilities based on past experiences. science at its best is a way to share experience, to offer and evaluate alternative explanations, to project future possibilities based on past experiences. declare I have no competing interests. declare I have no competing interests."}
