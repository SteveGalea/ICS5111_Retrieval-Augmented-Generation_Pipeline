{"summary": "antimicrobial prescription has been recorded in between 45 and 70% of canine diarrhoea cases (2, 5, 7, 20, 21), with prescription most frequent in cases presenting with pyrexia or haemorrhagic diarrhoea (2, 5). antimicrobial prescription is a particular focus for research due to the increasing threat posed by antimicrobial resistance. complex and often undetermined aetiology of acute canine diarrhoea provides a natural opportunity to understand factors that might drive complex clinical decision-making in practice. a longitudinal retrospective study analysed electronic health records (EHRs) collected from 179 volunteer veterinary practices (347 sites) situated in the united kingdom (UK) questions provided to consulting veterinary professionals were selected for inclusion in this study. if diarrhoea was present please indicate disease severity Mild illness i.e., normal apart from GI disease Moderately ill Severely ill. each EHR also included a text-based product description and free text clinical narrative. each EHR also contained a vaccination history. animals were defined as currently vaccinated if they had received a vaccination within 3.5 years preceding the relevant consultation date. clinical narratives for all cases re-presenting for examination between 1 and 10 days post-initial presentation were also read to record explicit mention of diarrhoeic clinical sign resolution. cases were defined as lost to follow-up if they did not re-present to the veterinary practice at all by 31 January 2018, or were seen again within 10 days post-initial presentation. 21 binary or categorical explanatory variables were considered. for all models, these included factors related to animal signalment. questionnaire responses (presence of haemorrhagic diarrhoea, melaena, vomiting, decreased appetite, weight loss, diarrhoeic pattern, clinical severity) multivariable analyses underwent step-wise backward elimination to reduce Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) multivariable analyses underwent step-wise backward elimination to reduce Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) a further questionnaire was completed in a random selection of consultations by the attending veterinary professional. questions provided to consulting veterinary professionals in 10% of consultations (selected at random) where they had selected \u201cgastrointestinal\u201d as the main reason the animal presented to the practice. consultations were selected for presence of diarrhoea but not at exclusion of other clinical signs. each EHR also included a text-based product description and free text clinical narrative. each EHR also contained a vaccination history; animals were defined as currently vaccinated if they had received a vaccination within 3.5 years preceding the relevant consultation date. clinical narratives for all cases re-presenting for examination between 1 and 10 days post-initial presentation were also read to record explicit mention of diarrhoeic clinical sign resolution. cases were defined as lost to follow-up if they did not re-present to the veterinary practice at all by 31 January 2018, or were seen again within 10 days post-initial presentation. a likelihood ratio test of a null model indicated observations were clustered within practice and site. explanatory variables were retained if a LRT indicated P 0.20 against a null model. in total, 21 binary or categorical explanatory variables were considered. for all models, these included factors related to animal signalment. multivariable analyses underwent step-wise backward elimination to reduce Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). multivariable analyses underwent step-wise backward elimination to reduce Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) 62.2% of male cases were neutered (95% CI 59.6\u201364.9), 72.4% of female cases were neutered (95% CI 69.7\u201375.1), 54.6% of total retained cases were microchipped (95% CI 52.1\u201357.2), 24.4% of total retained cases were insured (95% CI 22.1\u201326.7) and 73.6% of total retained cases has been vaccinated within the preceding 3.5 years. an interpreted normal or below 39.0\u00b0C body temperature was recorded in 58.4% of cases (n = 1,865, 95% CI 56.5\u201360.4), 39.0\u00b0C39.4\u00b0C in 13.1% (n = 418, 95% CI 11.8\u201314.4), 39.5\u201339.9\u00b0C in 3.5% (n = 110, 95% CI 2.8\u20134.1) and >40.0\u00b0C in 0.9% of cases (n = 30, 95% CI 3.8 (2.1\u20135.4) 11.8 (0.0\u201327.3) Melaena 0.4 (0.2\u20130.6) 0.2 (0.0\u20130.3) 1.6 (0.5\u20132.7) 5.9 (0.0\u201317.0) Weight lossb 1.2 (0.8\u20131.6) 0.8 (0.5\u20131.1) 3.2 (1.4\u20134.9) 6.0 (0.0\u201317.2) Poor appetite 13.8 (12.4\u201315.2) 10.3 (8.9\u201311.6) 31.5 (27.3\u201335.8) 35.4 (11.9\u201358. 0.5\u20133.5) 11.7 (0.0\u201325.8) Haematology/biochemistry 2.4 (1.8\u20133.1) 1.4 (0.9\u20131.8) 6.1 (3.8\u20138.4) 52.7 (27.9\u201377.5) Serum B12 and/or TLI 0.1 (0.0\u20130.2) 0.1 (0.0\u20130.2) 0.2 (0.0\u20130.6) 0.0 (0.0\u20130.0) Specific pancreatic lipase 0.6 (0.3\u20130.9) 0.4 (0.2\u20130.6) 1.6 systemic antimicrobials were the most commonly prescribed pharmaceutical agent (49.7% of cases at initial presentation, rising to 52.5% within 10 days of initial presentation) gastrointestinal nutraceuticals were also frequently dispensed. metronidazole represented the most commonly prescribed systemic antimicrobial (47.0% of antimicrobial prescribing cases, 95% CI 41.0\u201353.1);
