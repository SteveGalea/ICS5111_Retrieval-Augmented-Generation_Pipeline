{"summary": "helicases/translocases are ATP-dependent motor proteins capable of moving along their nucleic acid substrates while either unwinding duplexed regions (helicases) or performing other functions (translocases) these enzymes are known to be critical players in a wide variety of biological processes and are encoded by all organisms, as well as positive-stranded RNA (+RNA) viruses with genomes larger than about 7 kb. the helicase domain of the dendrolimus punctatus tetravirus was found to have dsRNA-unwinding activity with 5\u2032-3\u2032 directionality (14) the helicase domain of the plant tomato mosaic virus (ToMV; family Virgaviridae) was not characterized enzymatically, but its crystal structure revealed the two canonical RecA-like / domains (1A and 2A) of the helicase core (15). AV outranks almost all other mammalian +RNA virus genomes. coronavirus genomes (26.3\u201331.7 kb) are larger than any other RNA virus group. nidoviruses with genomes >20 kb use a proofreading 3\u2032-5\u2032 RNA exonuclease. the nidovirus replicase backbone consists of a conserved array of domains arranged in a nidovirus-specific order. the nidovirus replicase backbone consists of a conserved array of domains arranged in a nidovirus-specific order. sg mRNAs are used to express up to a dozen structural and accessory proteins from smaller ORFs in the 3\u2032-proximal part of nidoviral genetic marker varies in size and sequence between arteri- and coronaviruses (37). nsp10 ZBD is separated from the downstream HEL1 domain by an uncharacterized domain that varies in size and sequence between arteri- and coronaviruses (37). nsp10 is a helicase-competent derivative of EAV nsp10, alone and in complex with poly(dT) nidovirus helicase activity depends on the extensive relay of interactions between the ZBD, accessory and HEL1 domains. nsp10 is composed of amino acids 2371\u20132837 of replicase pp1ab. nsp10 residues 1\u2013467 were cloned into a modified pET28a vector. the soluble fraction was applied to a Ni2+ chelating column. the protein was eluted (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.0 or 8.0, 500 mM NaCl and 60 mM imidazole) the protein was digested with 10% (w/w) TEV protease. the two partially complementary sequences were 5\u2032-TTTTTTTTTTTTGCAGTGCTCG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CGCGAGCACTGC-3\u2032) were mixed in a 1:1.5 molar ratio and incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight. crystals were cryoprotected in mother liquor containing 25% (v/v) ethylene glycol and flash cooled to 173\u00b0C. resolution ()b 50\u20132.83 (2.88\u20132.83) 50\u20132.80 (2.85\u20132.80) 50\u20132.75 (2.80\u20132.75) 50\u20132.0 (2.03\u20132.0) 50\u20132.65 (2.03\u20132.65) Rmerge (%) 8.7 (38.9) 9.0 (39.9) 9.3 (42.8) 7.4 (2.2) 15.5 (1.9) 17 (2.8) 42.0 (2) 25.6 (3.4) Completeness (%) 97.6 (87.2) 98.8 the figure of merit from the MAD phasing was 0.36 and the Z score was 15.7. several segments of the protein could be automatically modelled into the electron-density map by RESOLVE, although in part only as poly-alanine chains. sp10) were cloned into a modified pET28a vector with a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site. mutants were generated using the QuikChange protocol and confirmed by DNA sequencing. purified protein and partially double-stranded DNA were mixed in a 1:1.5 molar ratio and incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight. crystals were cryoprotected in mother liquor containing 25% (v/v) ethylene glycol and flash cooled to 173\u00b0C. nsp10 and its complex with DNA were collected at beamline NE3A at Photon Factory (KEK) and beamline BL17U1 at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility. data was indexed, integrated and scaled using HKL2000 (41) data collection and processing statistics are summarized in Table 1. Table 1. Data collection and refinement statistics of nsp10 and the nsp10\u2013DNA complexa. the structure of nsp10 was determined by the MAD method. initial phases were calculated by RESOLVE (42) the figure of merit from the MAD phasing was 0.36 and the Z score was 15.7. domain 1B was manually added with the aid of 2Fo\u2013Fc and Fo\u2013Fc maps using COOT (43) the final model was refined to 2.65 with an Rwork of 23.2% and an Rfree of 25.7%. replacement of the conserved lysine of the Walker A motif abolished ATPase and consequentially also helicase activity. the observed activities could be completely attributed to the recombinant EAV proteins used, rather than to potential trace amounts of contaminating bacterial enzymes. the results of the ATPase assay lead us to propose that the observed reduction of duplex unwinding may be due to unproductive ATP hydrolysis. the input ATP in the nsp10 assay may have been depleted before complete unwinding was achieved. this result is in good agreement with the fact that the truncated protein retained all HEL1 key domains. the presence and position of three zinc atoms were established with anomalous data collected from the zinc absorption edge. the final model included EAV nsp10 residues 1\u2013401, three zinc ions in the N-terminal ZBD, five sulphate ions and 267 water molecules. two adjacent and structurally different zinc fingers, an N-terminal RING-like module (residues 1\u201340, pink) and a treble-clef zinc finger (residues 41\u201365, red) constitute the main body of ZBD. only 12 out of 13 Cys/His residues are involved in zinc binding. RING-like module has a notable binuclear structure with a cross-brace topology involving 6 Cys and 2 His residues that coordinate two zinc ions. the second zinc ion (Zn2) is coordinated by residues Cys17, Cys33, His29 and His32. the zinc finger of ZBD adopts a treble-clef fold distinct from that of the RING module. two one-turn helices 2 and 3 are stabilized by a zinc atom (Zn3) that is chelated by residues Cys42 and His44 of a Zn-knuckle within loop L5, while Cys53 and Cys56 originate from L6 and 3, respectively. 143, Leu147, Pro247, Val248, Leu280 and Trp281 in domain 1A together with residues Ile71, Leu72, Leu75, Leu76 and Ile79 from 4 in ZBD create an extensive hydrophobic surface. a major part of this interface involves the 4 helix, which is located in a groove formed by two helices and a loop of domain 1A. a replication-negative phenotype was described for mutant D45A (36) it is now clear that Asp45 forms two hydrogen bonds with the main and side chain of Thr35 and electrostatically interacts with the side chain of His34. replacement of Asp45 may thus greatly reduce these interactions and disrupt ZBD integrity, potentially affecting the structure of the HEL1. mutant S59P carries adjacent Pro residues at positions 59 and 60. the introduction of two Gly residues at these positions probably gives rise to excessive flexibility of the hinge region, thus compromising nsp10 function in a similar manner. the structure of the nsp10 HEL1 domain was found to be most similar to the helicase core of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay factor Upf1. the binuclear RING-like module of nsp10 ZBD was found to be most similar to RING-like module 1 in the CH-domain of Upf1. nidovirus RNA helicases, including EAV nsp10, were previously found to lack the ability to discriminate between RNA and DNA substrates. the binding of this substrate was deduced from an increase of the protein\u2019s Stokes radius in gel filtration chromatography. the asymmetric unit contained four nsp10-DNA binary complexes with a Matthews coefficient of 2.73 3/Da, corresponding to a solvent content of 55%. the RMSD of their C atoms was only 0.8, indicating apparent structural flexibility of these residues. however, outside these domains, the effect of DNA binding was considerable, with the effect of DNA binding increasing to 1.8. temperature factor calculations suggest that the regions at the surface of domain 1B not directly involved in DNA binding may become flexible. for example, domain 1B residues Arg95, Gly125 and Ala131 become disordered after DNA binding. phosphodiester backbone and non-specific protein\u2013base interactions. no interaction was observed between nsp10 and position C2\u2032 of the ribose ring of the protein. base T1 is exposed to the solvent and protrudes outwards. EAV nsp10 has the ability to unwind both DNA and RNA. nsp10 has the ability to interact with the 2\u2032 OH moiety of the RNA backbone. nsp10 is enzymatically active. poly-uridine (polyU) nsp10 showed a 5-fold higher ATPase activity than the full-length protein. this increased ATP turnover did apparently not translate into increased helicase activity. replacement of the conserved lysine of the Walker A motif abolished ATPase. enzymatic differences between nsp10 and nsp10 may be caused by the latter\u2019s truncation. the results of the ATPase assay lead us to propose that the observed reduction of duplex unwinding may be due to unproductive ATP hydrolysis. the input ATP in the nsp10 assay may have been depleted before complete unwinding was achieved. nsp10 reveals a multi-domain organization of the arterivirus replicative helicase because 3D structures of orthologous proteins were not available. nsp10 residues 1\u2013401, three zinc ions in the N-terminal ZBD, five sulphate ions and 267 water molecules were solved. two adjacent and structurally different zinc fingers constitute the main body of ZBD. two adjacent and structurally different zinc fingers, an N-terminal RING-like module and a treble-clef zinc finger constitute the main body of ZBD. topology of the ZBD with its RING-like module (pink), treble-clef zinc finger (red) and Linker 1 (yellow) indicated. residues coordinating the Zn2+ ions are shown as sticks. sequence alignment of ZBD with the CH domain of hUpf1. zinc-coordinating residues of both zinc-binding motifs of the RING module may include both His and Cys residues in other arteri- and coronaviruses. the RING module of these viruses can be described by a characteristic conserved Cys2A-CysB-Cys[His/Cys]A-[His/Cys]3B pattern (where applicable, brackets indicate positions at which His and Cys can alternate) residues Leu138, Val141, Val143, Leu147, Pro247, Val248, Leu280 and Trp281 in domain 1A together with residues Ile71, Leu72, Leu75, Leu76 and Ile79 from 4 in ZBD create an extensive hydrophobic surface. the total interface area between ZBD and the HEL1 is 1019 2, as determined by protein interfaces, surfaces and assemblies (PISA) server (50) a replication-negative phenotype was described for mutant D45A (36) it is now clear that asp45 forms two hydrogen bonds with the main and side chain of Thr35 and electrostatically interacts with the side chain of His34. replacement of Asp45 may thus greatly reduce these interactions and disrupt ZBD integrity, potentially affecting the structural integrity of the HEL1. the treble-clef Thr54 is also connected to the Pro60 side chain and Lys61 main chain. owing to the unique properties of the Pro residue, the orientation of 4 relative to 1A is likely affected in mutant S59P. the introduction of two Gly residues at these positions probably gives rise to excessive flexibility of the hinge region, thus compromising nsp10 function in similar manner. the structure of the nsp10 HEL1 domain was found to be most similar to the helicase core of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay factor Upf1. the binuclear RING-like module of nsp10 ZBD was found to be most similar to RING-like module 1 in the CH-domain of Upf1. loops L1, L3 and helix 1 in nsp10 are shorter than the corresponding elements in nsp1. the treble-clef zinc finger also has a zinc finger downstream of the RING1 module. similarities are further enhanced by the 5\u2032-3\u2032 directionality of duplex unwinding shared by both these helicases. asymmetric unit contained four nsp10-DNA binary complexes with a Matthews coefficient of 2.73 3/Da, corresponding to a solvent content of 55%. these complexes shared a remarkably similar spatial arrangement with the RMSD of their C atoms being only 0.8. however, outside these domains, the effect of DNA binding was considerable. reorganization makes this channel large enough to accept single-stranded nucleic acids. double-stranded nucleic acids must be unwound at the entrance of the substrate channel to let a single-stranded chain enter. temperature factor calculations suggest that regions at the surface of domain 1B not directly involved in DNA binding may become flexible. the backbone phosphates of the poly(dT) are located on top of domains 1A and 2A. the majority of contacts with the bound DNA are made via the phosphodiester backbone and non-specific protein\u2013base interactions. base T1 is exposed to the solvent and protrudes outwards, causing a bend in the DNA backbone between T1 and T2. no interaction was observed between nsp10 and position C2\u2032 of the ribose ring of the DNA substrate. nsp10 has the ability to unwind both DNA and RNA. nidoviruses stand out for their large to very large genome size. the two central subunits of the nidovirus replicase, the RdRp and the unique ZBD-containing RNA helicase, have remained poorly characterized, also due to the lack of structural information. our present analysis of the arterivirus helicase structure revealed a number of important similarities with Upf1 helicases, eukaryotic enzymes involved in quality control of RNAs through multiple pathways. nsp10 of arteriviruses and its orthologs in other nidoviruses are multi-domain proteins. of its domains, ZBD and the HEL1 domains are critical for the enzyme\u2019s ATPase and helicase activities in vitro and for the regulation of viral replication and transcription in infected cells. runcated nsp10 lacks the 65 residues (C-terminal domain) downstream of the known HEL1 motifs. this protein was found to bind partially double-stranded DNA and display the previously reported in vitro ATPase and helicase activities. this suggests that the C-terminal domain may have evolved to (co)regulate nsp10 helicase-mediated functions in vivo. this could be achieved either directly, by interacting with structural superposition of RING-like modules of nsp10 and hUpf1 reveals how the only other similarly tolerated replacement (36,37), that of the Zn1-coordinating Cys25 by His (found in the equivalent position in hUpf1) could be accommodated by nsp10. only seven thymidine residues could be confirmed in the structure of the nsp10-DNA complex. the nsp10 structure revealed two possible RNA-binding clefts at the surface of nsp10, which are formed by domains 1B and ZBD. both have continuous positively charged surfaces, with the latter sufficiently large to bind a ssRNA >10 bp. the orientation is the same as in panel B. the treble-clef zinc finger may be recognized by yet-to-be identified interaction partners modulating nsp10 function. nsp10 may switch from a role in genome replication to directing viral transcription. nidovirus helicase interacts, commonly through its C/H and 1A domains, with proteins that can modulate its function. this could explain the exclusive conservation of ZBD in nidoviruses, which stand out for their large to very large single-stranded RNA genomes. nsp10 of arteriviruses and its orthologs in other nidoviruses are multi-domain proteins. of its domains, ZBD and the HEL1 domains are critical for the enzyme\u2019s ATPase and helicase activities in vitro. nsp10 lacks the 65 residues (C-terminal domain) downstream of the known HEL1 motifs. this protein was found to bind partially double-stranded DNA and display the previously reported in vitro ATPase and helicase activities. this suggests that the C-terminal domain may have evolved to (co)regulate nsp10 helicase-mediated functions in vivo. this could be achieved either directly, by interacting with the nucle structural superposition of the RING-like modules of nsp10 and hUpf1 reveals how the only other similarly tolerated replacement (36,37), that of the Zn1-coordinating Cys25 by His (found in the equivalent position in hUpf1) could be accommodated. nsp10 structure revealed two possible RNA-binding clefts at the surface of nsp10, which are formed by domains 1B and ZBD (named putative exit site 1) and 1A and ZBD (putative exit site 2). both have continuous positively charged surfaces, with the latter being sufficiently large to bind a ssRNA >10 bp. the positively charged ZBD, and especially its RING-like module, would be involved. the treble-clef zinc finger may be recognized by yet-to-be identified interaction partners modulating nsp10 function. the treble-clef finger is fairly distant from the bound substrate, suggesting long-distance signal transduction within nsp10, possibly involving helix 4. upf1 interacts, commonly through its C/H and 1A domains, with proteins that can modulate its function. for the nidovirus helicase subunit, the functional basis of its domain conservation remains to be established. nidoviruses stand out for their large to very large single-stranded RNA genomes. the structural similarity between nsp10 and upf1 establishes a new connection between research on viral and cellular helicases. coordinates and structure-factor amplitudes of EAV nsp10 and EAV nsp10\u2013DNA complex have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession codes 4N0N and 4N0O."}
