{"summary": "viruses must fuse their envelope with a target cell membrane. they carry specialized surface glycoproteins that mediate attachment to and fusion with the host membrane. fusion proteins can be divided into three distinct classes according to their molecular organization and fusion mechanism (1). coV entry is mediated by the spike (S) protein, an exceptionally large glycoprotein of approximately 1,200 to 1,450 amino acid residues in length. the trimeric S proteins characteristically decorate the extracellular virus particles. some coVs lack a furin cleavage site at the S1/S2 junction and hence carry uncleaved S protein in their virions. the exact cleavage position within the CoV S protein generating the fusogenic subunit has been difficult to predict. the formal demonstration of S protein cleavage upon entry is currently lacking. we developed a novel unbiased approach to selectively identify and characterize the S proteins of incoming viruses that accomplish fusion. a polyclonal rabbit anti-MHV serum (K135) was used to detect infected cells by reaction with anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G conjugated to HRP. a transfer vector based on pXHERLM was generated to create the recombinant MHV-BAP virus encoding a tandem repeat of the 15-amino-acid. recombinant viruses MHVFCSBAP and MHVS2*BAP were generated by introducing additional point mutations into the transfer vector using site-directed mutagenesis. pQCXIN-CCM plasmid encoding the MHV receptor, murine carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1a (CCM), was generated by cloning the CCM gene into the pQCXIN Moloney murine leuk the polyclonal HEK-CCM, HeLa-CCM, and Vero-CCM cell lines were selected and maintained with G418 (PAA) LR7-BirA cells were selected at 15 g/ml and maintained at 10 g of puromycin (Sigma, catalog no. P8833)/ml. the cells were chilled on ice, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in ice-cold radio immunoprecipitation assay buffer. the cells were cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. the following protease inhibitors were used at their highest recommended working range concentrations. LR7 or LR7-BirA cells were cultured to confluence on 10-cm dishes. ice-cold inoculum was added for 45 min to allow attachment of the virus to the target cells at 8\u00b0C. cycloheximide/ml was added 30 min after warming up the infection to 37\u00b0C for all samples with an infection period longer than 30 min or at the end of the infection. the sample for 0 min was prepared for lysis after 1 min at 37\u00b0C. aliquots were directly lysed and denatured in sample buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 50% glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% SDS, and bromophenol blue. samples after immunoprecipitation were eluted from beads by boiling at 95\u00b0C for 10 min. mouse hepatitis virus (MHV strain 2, AAF19386.1 and strain MHV-A59, NP_045300.1), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV strain Tor2, NP_828851.1), and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV strain TO14, AF302263_1). cells, viruses, antibodies, and HR2 peptide were maintained in LR7 cells in culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal bo recombinant viruses MHVFCSBAP and MHVS2*BAP were generated by introducing additional point mutations into the transfer vector using site-directed mutagenesis. pQCXIN-CCM plasmid encoding the MHV receptor was generated by cloning the CCM gene into the pQCXIN Moloney murine leukemia virus packaging vector (Clontech) pQCXIP-BirA packaging vector was cloned into the pQCXIP vector. hek-293T, HeLa, and vero-CCL81 cell lines expressing the CCM receptor were made after transduction with vesicular stomatitis virus G protein-pseudotyped MLV using the pQCXIN-CCM packaging vector. cells were inoculated with virus-containing cell culture supernatant supplemented with 50 g of DEAE-dextran (Sigma, catalog no. D9885)/ml and 10 M biotin (Sigma, catalog no. B4639) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10. after 30 min, protein biosynthesis was inhibited by the addition of 50 g of cycloheximide (Sigma, catalog no. C7698) sepharose beads were pelleted at 6,000 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. excess supernatant was carefully removed, and samples were finally denatured. cells were pretreated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C, followed by infection in presence of respective compounds. all samples were harvested at the same time to even out the time between lysis and immunoprecipitation. 50 g of cycloheximide/ml was added 30 min after warming up infection to 37\u00b0C. aliquots were directly lysed and denatured in sample buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 50% glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% SDS, and bromophenol blue. samples were transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Bio-Rad, catalog no. 162-0176) amino acid sequence alignment was performed by CLUSTAL W2 using S sequences of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV strain Beaudette, NP_040831.1), mouse hepatitis virus (MERS-CoV; strain HCoV-EMC, AFS88936.1), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MHV-A59, NP_045300.1), and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV strain TO14, AF3022 a biotinylation assay was designed to selectively identify and characterize the S protein of MHV virions that underwent membrane fusion with the cellular target membrane. MHV-BAP showed similar growth kinetics but yielded 10-fold-reduced titers compared to wild-type MHV. target cells express cytoplasmic protein biotin ligase (BirA) Upon membrane fusion, the C-terminal BAP of S protein is introduced into the cytoplasm and can be accessed and biotinylated by BirA. recombinant MHV-BAP was produced in LR7 cells or LR7 cells expressing BirA (LR7-BirA) a polyclonal antibody directed against the BAP specifically detected S0 and the S2 subunit of MHV-BAP but not those of wild-type MHV. biotinylation of the BAP-tagged S protein was only detected for MHV-BAP viruses produced in LR7-BirA cells. LR7-BirA cells were inoculated with MHV-BAP for 90 min. only biotinylated S protein was detected by streptavidin-HRP conjugate. presence of PP during lysis allowed exclusive detection of S protein. the experiment confirmed that biotinylation of S proteins only occurs after virus-cell fusion. we hypothesized that the S2* subunit represents the proteolytically primed subunit of MHV S protein. PP during the IP procedure revealed the overall biochemical fate of all (i.e., fused and nonfused) S proteins over a 90-min time period. the relative amount of the S2* cleavage product increased over time, whereas the S0 and S2 signal slowly vanished. the proteolytic process leading to S2* formation was not blocked by NH4Cl. ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) was added during infection. same as panel A, except that by addition of PP during lysis, only S protein that has been biotinylated during infection was detected. MHV infection was supplemented in time with the HR2 fusion inhibitor. MHV infection coincided with the accumulation of the S2* subunit as monitored by intracellular biotinylation. arginine is not the cleavage site that yields the fusion active S2* subunit. this region comprises a conserved arginine, previously described as a potential protease target site. the knockout of the furin cleavage site at the S1/S2 junction in MHVFCS-BAP prevented the appearance of the S2 form (22). in contrast, serine substitution of the two arginines at the presumed S2\u2032 cleavage site in MHVS2\u2032-BAP did not prevent the formation of the S2* subunit. the average titer of three independent virus preparations was determined by endpoint dilution. BirA cells, infected with the recombinant viruses for 90 min, were lysed in the absence or presence of pyrophosphate (PP). biotinylation of immunoprecipitated S proteins was detected by Western blotting. LR7-BirA cells were inoculated with MHV-BAP for 90 min. after the IP, S protein bound to protein G-Sepharose beads was denatured. samples were deglycosylated by PNGase F to remove all N-linked glycans. infections of LR7 cell without BirA are independent of biotinylation. the prior streptavidin-biotin interaction reduces the anti-BAP antibody reactivity. to obtain information on the cleavage site, we attempted to identify the responsible host cell proteases. MHV-BAP infection was performed on LR7-BirA cells for 90 min. lysosomotropic agents NH4Cl and bafilomycin A1 abolished fusion. none of the applied agents could prevent the S protein cleavage that results in the formation of the S2* subunit. LR7-BirA target cells were pretreated with broad-spectrum protease inhibitors for 30 min. infection with MHV-BAP was allowed in the presence of protease inhibitors for 90 min. sample preparation was performed in the absence of PP as described for panel A. recombinant MHV-BAP recognizes the biotin acceptor peptide (BAP) as the substrate for biotin ligation in the presence of ATP and free biotin. in intact virions, the BAP faces the luminal side and is protected from modification by BirA, but upon virus-cell fusion it becomes exposed to the enzyme. MHV-BAP displayed similar growth kinetics but yielded 10-fold-reduced titers a biotin acceptor peptide was fused to the C terminus of the S protein. target cells stably express cytoplasmic protein biotin ligase (BirA) Upon membrane fusion, the C-terminal BAP of S protein is introduced into the cytoplasm and can be accessed and biotinylated. monoclonal antibody recognizing the S2 subunit detected the full-length S protein (S0) and the S2 subunit of all virus preparations. biotinylation of the BAP-tagged S protein was only detected for MHV-BAP viruses produced in LR7-BirA cells. the S2* was the most abundant S protein product detected. only limited amounts of S0 and S2 were observed. the presence of PP during lysis allowed the exclusive detection of S protein that was biotinylated during infection. peptide fusion inhibitor effectively abrogates biotinylation of the S protein in the presence of PP. if the novel S2* subunit represents the proteolytically primed subunit of MHV S protein, the kinetics of S protein cleavage should be equal to or faster than productive MHV infection. MHV-BAP was bound to LR7-BirA cells at 8\u00b0C for 1 h. virus was allowed to bind to cells at 8\u00b0C for 1 h, followed by removal of the inoculum. infection was continued at 37\u00b0C. immunoprecipitated S proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. biotinylated protein was detected by using a streptavidin-HRP conjugate. a background band (bg) is indicated. the MHV infection deduced from the HR2 peptide time-of-addition experiment showed similar kinetics to proteolysis of S protein yielding the S2* product. in comparison, the intensities of the biotinylated S2* protein bands observed in the virus-cell fusion experiment were quantified and included in a bar chart. MHV variant with mutated furin cleavage site at the S1/S2 junction was generated by replacing the arginines by serines. mutant viruses were viable and used to infect LR7-BirA cells for 90 min at equal MOI. knockout of the furin cleavage site in MHVFCS-BAP prevented the appearance of the S2 form (22) the average titer of three independent virus preparations was determined by endpoint dilution. BirA cells, infected with the recombinant viruses for 90 min, were lysed in the absence or presence of pyrophosphate (PP) biotinylation of immunoprecipitated S proteins was detected by Western blotting. we tried to identify the S2\u2032 cleavage site by alternative approaches. the biotinylation assay did not yield sufficient amount and purity of the S2* subunit to allow N-terminal amino acid sequencing. instead, we deglycosylated the S protein to more precisely determine the molecular weight of S2*. blot was restained with antiserum against the BAP in order to visualize the S proteins from infections of LR7 cell without BirA. the prior streptavidin-biotin interaction reduces the anti-BAP antibody reactivity, particularly in fully biotinylated samples prepared in absence of PP. a virus entry assay was performed in the presence of various protease inhibitors, suppressing the activity of the main classes of proteases. the involvement of low-pH-dependent proteases was probed using the lysosomotropic agents NH4Cl and bafilomycin A1. none of the applied agents could prevent the S protein cleavage that results in the formation of the S2* subunit. mbryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1a (CCM) were infected with MHV-BAP*bio for 90 min. immunoprecipitated S proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. biotinylation was detected by using the streptavidin-HRP conjugate. the size of the S2* protein indicates cleavage to occur in the S2\u2032 region just upstream of the putative FP. deglycosylation of the S2* protein resulted in a heterogeneous product. the appearance and characteristics of the S2* subunit support the idea that it represents the fusion-ready subunit. a novel biochemical assay based on the conditional biotinylation of proteins to concentrate and purify MHV S proteins involved in functional virus-cell fusion events. this enables the identification and characterization of fused S proteins in combination with more classical experiments using site-directed mutagenesis and protease inhibitors. the assay can be adapted to monitor the biochemical fate of structural virion components of any enveloped or nonenveloped virus upon entry. cleavage of MHV S protein at the S1/S2 junction may provide structural flexibility to increase accessibility of a cleavage site for priming. it is possible that S proteins are processed into S2*, perhaps via a short-lived intermediate S2 form that is not detected. this may explain cell-cell fusion inability of the MHV spikes lacking a functional furin cleavage site. proteolytic priming of the MHV-2 S proteins upon virus entry was earlier implicated by studies with inhibitors of endolysosomal proteases and lysosomotropic agents. however, the actual processing in cells was not confirmed. the HR2 peptide inhibitor prevents virus from fusion by inhibiting 6-helix bundle formation (11) infectivity of MHV remained unaffected, and the cleavage pattern upon fusion remained unaltered. we enzymatically removed the N-linked glycans of the S2* glycoprotein. the cleavage site may not be an absolute requirement for fusion. inhibitors failed to block MHV-A59 infection (6, 14) we observed no effect on proteolytic processing of MHV S proteins. a given protease inhibitor may not block all individual proteases of a specific class. a given protease inhibitor may not block all individual proteases of a specific class. lysosomal degradation affects all forms of S but does not block cleavage into the S2* subunit. all class I viral fusion proteins must minimally meet two requirements to accomplish fusion: proteolytic priming and triggering of membrane fusion. cleavage in the target cell provides an extra level of spatial and temporal control of virus fusion. the priming of S proteins plays a pivotal role in the temporal and spatial regulation of CoV entry. the priming events that occur after receptor binding and depend on cellular proteases can be characterized in detail."}
