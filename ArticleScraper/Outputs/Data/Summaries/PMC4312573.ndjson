{"summary": "the global pandemic of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) caused by HIV continues to expand. 2.5 million people became newly infected in 2011 and 1.7 million died that year from AIDS related causes. there is no effective preventive vaccine in the world. AIDS vaccine development has followed three major trends. the third wave of candidate vaccines was aimed at induction of both humeral and cell-mediated immune responses with heterogonous priming-booster strategies. the results from the phase III clinical trial (RV144) for ALVAC/AIDSVAX showed modest efficacy. gp120 induced high titers of neutralizing antibodies and provided effective protection for animals attacked by virus in animal experiments. a shorter RBD area can effectively avoid this problem, such as SARS vaccine [22] review will focus on the characteristics of HIV RBD, analyze the RBD of gp120 as a target to develop HIV vaccines. we will propose some new ideas and the new specific-boosting strategies based on these issues. the gp120 consists of five conserved regions (C1 to C5) interspaced with five variable regions (V1 to V5). the third variable loop of gp120 can be separated from the main body of gp120 for direct contact with coreceptors during viral fusion. a structurally conserved cavity is localized between the inner and outer domain of gp120 into which Phe43 of the CD4 on the target cell protrudes during the interaction between viral gp120 and cellular CD4 receptor. it is a discontinuous determinant consisting of the residues in the cavity, including Trp112, Val255, Thr257, Asp368, Glu370, Thr257, Trp427, Val430, and Gly473 [ several more potent CD4bs-specific neutralizing mAbs have been identified. the mAb VRC01 neutralizes about 90% of different HIV clades tested. the mAb VRC01 neutralizes about 90% of different HIV clades. native conformational epitopes on native gp120/gp41 trimer. some groups aimed to construct gp120 or gp140 trimer with native conformation by linking extracellular region of gp41 covalently to the gp120. other groups expressed the uncleaved and unactivated gp140 using fold on trimer domain of T4 phage pilus. a human CD4bs monoclonal antibody 1F7 was reported recently. the epitope of 1F7 had not been described until the current study. it is important to note that 1F7 proved induced shedding of gp120 from spikes of primary HIV-1. some studies showed that Tyr10 and Tyr14 in CCR5 play a critical role in the interaction of gp120 with CCR5 and in viral entry. some of these conserved CD4-induced epitopes in the gp120 bridging sheet contain neutralizing epitopes that can elicit broadly cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies. soluble CD4 (sCD4) could markedly enhance the fusion efficiency between HIV-1 and the cells expressing a coreceptor, CCR a substantial proportion of the broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) identified in certain HIV-1 infected donors recognize glycan-dependent epitopes on HIV-1 gp120. a number of other glycan-dependent bnAbs include PG16, 121\u2013123, PGTs 130-131, and PGTs 142\u2013145. the envelope of HIV-1 carries spikes. each spike is made of three molecules of the surface glycoprotein gp120 and three molecules of the transmembrane glycoprotein gp41. binding sites of broadly acting and potent HIV-1-specific neutralizing antibodies are shown as coloured circles. 18D3, 2F5, 4E10, and 10E8 antibodies target NHR pocket or the transmembrane glycoprotein gp41 of HIV-1. each of the listed antibodies target in different sites, including CD4bs, V1, V2, and V3 loop, membrane-proximal region of gp41 (MPER) the design of an immunogen containing the CD4i epitopes that maintain native conformation is critical to the development of a coreceptor binding site-based AIDS vaccine. however, unlike the RBD of SARS-CoV spike protein, the CD4 and coreceptor binding domains in gp120 of HIV-1 are formed by a number of amino acids discontinuously spreading in almost the entire molecule. a new strategy is to inspire the specific neutralizing antibody to RBD epitopes by using the priming-booster mode. using the plasmid, which can be expressed the natural trimeric Env, or protein (such as ALVAC vector or VLP particles) immunizes first to arouse the activation of immune cells against natural trimeric Env RBD.
