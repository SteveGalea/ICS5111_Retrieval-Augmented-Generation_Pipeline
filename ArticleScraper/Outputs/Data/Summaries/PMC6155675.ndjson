{"summary": "essential oils (EOs) are volatile, natural, complex compounds isolated from natural plant materials (flowers, buds, seeds, leaves, root, and stem) EOs have a broad spectrum of biological activities, such as anti-microbial [1,2,3], antiviral [4] and anti-inflammatory effects [5]. xue et al. reported that solvent extraction performed at room temperature is highly efficient to extract Hou-riched HEO. however, there is no study reported on purification of essential oil from H. cordata. MRs are durable nonpolar, middle-polar, and polar macroporous polymers. they have been successfully applied for the separation of flavonoids from traditional Chinese medicine or herbs. they are biodegradable, biocompatible, physically stable, easy to scale up, and cost effective. the results indicated that the optimized extraction condition was A2 (factor A level 2)/B3/C3/D2 and the effect of the factors was D > A > B > C. ultrasonic time could improve the extraction efficiency and feasible extraction time and root length were beneficial for the penetration of solvent. four types of MRs ranging from non-polar to mid-polar were screened for the adsorption and desorption tests. their absorption capacities, desorption capacities and desorption ratios were shown in Figure 2. polarity of D101 and its larger pore diameters was selected as the optimal resin for further purification. desorption ratios were evaluated statistically, * p 0.05, ** p 0.01 compared to D101. desorption ratio is the highest when the ethanol concentration was 90%. ethanol\u2013water (90:10, v/v) solution was selected as the appropriate desorption solution. dynamic desorption curve was obtained according to the volume of loading sample and the Hou concentration of the leak solution. D101 resin was used to adsorb 7 BV of sample solution (Hou 0.225 mg/mL) for 3 h at a flow rate of 6 BV/h. then, 2 BV of deionized water and 5 BV of 30% ethanol were used to remove the high polar components and impurities. the solvent extraction used in this study had much higher efficiency than hydrodistillation extraction due to its mild extraction conditions and suitable solvent. the solvent extraction used in this study had much higher efficiency than hydrodistillation extraction due to its mild extraction conditions. crude HEO: crude HEO purified by macroporous resin. the average Hou content in pure HEO was 44.3% 2.01%. this showed a great potential for industrial applications. in vitro hemolysis tests were carried out to compare the hemolytic effect of different extracts. HEHEO had serious hemolytic effect and Tween 80 solution (2.5%) showed weak hemolysis, suggesting that HEHEO was toxic to erythrocyte. however, pure HEO showed no hemolysis or agglutination. hemolysis; +: Weak hemolysis; *: Erythrocytes are hemolytic in 1 h. 2.5.2. blank Tween 80 solution and blank ME had no effect on mice. nine of the 10 treated mice died after administration from severe toxicity. tic and recovered within 5 min 0/10 0 Pure HEO Tachypnea, dyspnea, tic and fainting 9/10 90 Pure HEO Tachypnea, ataxia and recovered within 3 min 0/10 0 HME No obvious reactions 0/10 0 Note: D/T, Dead/Treated mice. both in vitro hemolysis test and acute toxicity test proved that the HEHEO extracted by hydrodistillation showed serious toxicity in vitro antiviral activities of HEHEO, crude HEO, pure HEO, and HME against CVB3 and B6 with better safety. there is no approved vaccine or antiviral drug for the prevention or treatment of CVB-induced diseases to date. optimized extraction condition was as follows: ultrasonic time was 20 min (A2), extraction time was three days (B3), the H. cordata root length was 1.0 cm (C3), and the solid-liquid ratio was 1/1.5 (kg/L, D2) based on the polarity of the extract. the extract was treated by alcohol sinking and n-hexane extraction to prepare the crude HEO (Hou 15.0%) for MR purification. Levels Factor A (Ultrasonic Time, min) B (Extraction Time, day) C (Root Length, cm) D (Solid-Liquid Ratio, kg/L) four types of MRs ranging from non-polar to mid-polar were screened for the adsorption and desorption tests. their absorption capacities, desorption capacities and desorption ratios were shown in Figure 2. all of the tested MRs had similar and high adsorption capacities (>10 mg/g) ethanol\u2013water solution was selected as the appropriate desorption solution. the breakthrough volume is important in solid phase extraction because it represents the sample mount that can be adsorbed on resin. optimization for the Eluent Volume Before Hou desorption, 2 BV of distilled water and 5 BV of ethanol-water (30:70, v/v) were used to flush the resin to remove the high polar components and impurities. ethanol\u2013water (90:10, v/v) was used as the desorption solution and the dynamic desorption curve was obtained according to the eluent volume and the Hou concentration of the eluent. all tested MRs had similar and high adsorption capacities (>10 mg/g) HPD100 had the highest adsorption capacity of 11.16 mg/g owing to its relative high surface area. optimization for the Concentration of the Ethanol Solution Ethanol with low cost and nontoxic is usually used as the desorbent. the desorption ratio is the highest when the ethanol concentration was 90%. ethanol\u2013water solution was selected as the appropriate desorption solution. ethanol\u2013water (90:10, v/v) and ethanol-water (30:70, v/v) were used to flush the resin to remove the high polar components and impurities. the dynamic desorption curve was sharp and narrow with no trailing peak, which indicated that Hou was completely desorbed from D101 resin. after removing the solvent, pure HEO was obtained. hexane (30.87%), -myrcene (12.60%) and 2-undecanone (22.63%) hexane was the oxidative product of Hou, but the percentage of Hou was only 1.95% in HEHEO. 63 19.512 1.71 19.382 1.36 8 Caryophyllene 22.846 1.67 9 Houttuynin 24.559 1.95 24.691 80.88 24.468 84.94. the Hou percentage in Table 3 was calculated by area normalization method, which was not suitable for Hou content determination. HME had a high negative zeta potential of 37.51 mV with a high encapsulation rate of 94.7%. the results indicated that pure HEO was successfully encapsulated into ME. HEHEO exhibited significant acute toxicity such as tachypnea, dyspnea, tic, and fainting. nine of the 10 treated mice died after administration from severe toxicity. HEHEO, crude HEO, pure HEO, and HME were seriously toxic. purification by D101 resin could effectively remove the toxic impurities in the crude extract. pure HEO was fully encapsulated in the inner oil phase by the biodegradable and biocompatible shell. the tests indicated that hemolysis induced by HEHEO was one of the important reasons for ADR. MR purification could reduce hemolysis, and MEs could avoid hemolysis effectively. nine of the 10 treated mice died after administration from severe toxicity. for the pure HEO group, the mice showed tachypnea, dyspnea, tic, and fainting. however, there were no obvious reactions observed in the HME group. pure HEO (Hou 46.6%) showed significant antiviral activity with IC50 of 7.41 g/mL. crude HEO (Hou 15.0%) showed relatively weak activities (IC50 > 15 g/mL) this indicated that the solvent extraction following purification by D101 resin largely increased the content of Hou.

Macroporous Resin and Solvents D101 macroporous resin supplied by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. (Beijing, China) all chemicals and solvents were of analytical grade and used without further purification. mice (20 2 g) of both sexes and one male rabbit (2 kg) were purchased from Charles River (Beijing, China) the animal experiments were approved by the Animal Care and Welfare Committee of the Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College. the oven temperature was programmed at 50 \u00b0C for 3 min, with a rise of 5 \u00b0C/min up to 150 \u00b0C. the temperature of both the injector and detector was set at 250 \u00b0C. one microliter of sample was injected under split mode (ratio 1:3) a series of Hou standards in the range of 4.32\u2013216 g/mL were prepared in ethyl acetate solution to obtain the linear response (Y = 6.587X 5.367, r = 0.9999), where Y was the peak area of Hou, and X was the concentration of Hou (g/mL). ethyl acetate was obtained by hydrodistillation of 300 g of fresh roots. ethyl acetate was used to wash the oil and then removed by a rotary evaporator. the HEHEO was stored in sealed vials protected from light at 4 \u00b0C for further analysis. the experimental design was presented in Table 2 along with experimental data. the influence of the factor was determined by calculating the range of the k, which was the mean ratio of the corresponding level. the optimized extraction process was used for further extraction. the resin was washed with deionized water and desorbed with 10 mL 80% ethanol (v/v) then shaken (120 rpm) for 12 h at 25 \u00b0C. the adsorption capacity, desorption capacity and desorption ratio of each resin were selected as indexes. the conditions were as follows: Hou concentration of the loading sample solution was 0.225 mg/mL; sample flow rate was 6 BV/h. desorption solvents included different ethanol/water solutions with an adsorption flow rate of 6 BV/h. adsorption capacity = V 0 ( C 0 C e ) W (2) Desorption ratio = V d C d W (2) Desorption ratio = V d C d V 0 ( C 0 C e ) 100 % (3) where adsorption capacity (mg/g) represented the amount of Hou adsorbed on 1 g of dry resin. the HME particle size and zeta potential were measured by a PSS NICOMP Particle Size System (PSS, Port Richey, FL, USA) the encapsulation rate of HME was determined by measuring the free Hou in the aqueous phase through the high-speed centrifugation. the results were recorded at 30 min as well as at 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, and 4 h. the results were interpreted qualitatively as follows: Hemolysis (++): transparent and red solution without erythrocyte sinking. erythrocyte suspension (2%, v/v) was prepared by suspending the erythrocyte into the 0.9% sodium chloride. tubes 1\u20135 were filled with 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, and 0.1 mL of sample. 2% erythrocyte suspension (v/v) and different amounts of 0.9% sodium chloride were added to make a total volume of 5 mL. negative controls were blank Tween 80 (2.5%) solution and blank ME. no-treatment control was set for observation of symptoms and insurance of accuracy. TC50 was defined as the concentration that inhibited 50% cellular growth in comparison with the untreated controls. cells were plated into 96-well culture plates and incubated for 24 h. the medium was then removed and cells were infected with virus for 2 h. the selective index (SI) was calculated from the ratio of TC50/IC50. the spectrophotometric reading was taken at 490 nm using a microplate reader. 5Fifty percent (50%) toxic concentration (TC50) was defined as the concentration that inhibited 50% cellular growth. cells were plated into 96-well culture plates and incubated for 24 h. Hou, the major active constituent of HEO, possesses a very simple chemical structure and high antiviral activities. this is straightforward to evaluate its usefulness as a pure compound in the future."}
