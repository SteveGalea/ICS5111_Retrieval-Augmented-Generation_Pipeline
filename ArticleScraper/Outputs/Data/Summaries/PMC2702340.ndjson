{"summary": "core protein is an attractive target for HCV vaccine aimed to exterminate HCV infected cells. but core appears to have low immunogenicity in experimental settings. we devised immunization regimens that would lead to potent anti-core immune responses. single immunization with highly expressing pCMVcoreKozak induced specific IFN- and IL-2, and weak antibody response. the best was the heterologous pCMVcoreKozak prime/protein boost regimen that generated mixed Th1/Th2-cellular response with core-specific antibodies in titer 3 103. IC41 consisting of a panel of MHC class I and class II restricted epitopes adjuvanted by poly-L-arginine administered to healthy volunteers. another therapeutic vaccine employed peptides chosen individually for their ability to induce the strongest in vitro cellular response. core binds and packages the viral genomic RNA, regulates its translation and drives the production of infectious viruses [27-29] core contributes to HCV persistence indirectly by interfering with host cell transcription, apoptosis, lipid metabolism, and the development of immune response [30-33] DNA vaccines and recombinant protein vaccines use different mechanisms to elicit antigen-specific responses. DNA immunization is also highly effective in priming antigen-specific memory B cells. a recombinant protein vaccine is generally more effective at eliciting antibody responses than cell-mediated immune responses. the amplified DNA was cleaved with HindIII/XhoI and inserted into pcDNA3 cleaved with HindIII/XhoI resulting in pCMVcoreIRES. the amplified DNA was cleaved with NheI/KspAI and inserted into the plasmid pCMVE2/p7-2 [66] cleaved with NheI/XhoI, resulting in RU core differed from HCV AD78P1 core in positions 70 (H versus R), 75 (T versus A) and 147 (V versus T), respectively. plasmids were dissolved in the phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and used for in vitro expression assays and for DNA immunization. the percent of transfection was evaluated by counting the number of GFP expressing cells per 500 transfected NIH3T3 cells. cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection, counted, and 104 cells were lysed in 2 SDS Sample buffer. blots were blocked overnight in PBS-T with dry milk, stained with polyclonal anti-core antibodies #35-6 (1:5000) followed by the secondary anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated antibodies (DA a total of 100 g of pCMVcoreKozak were immunized with a total of 100 g of pCMVcoreKozak, or empty vector, split into four i. a total of 100 g of pCMVcoreKozak, or empty vector, were immunized. Scheme II Female 6\u20138 week old BALB/c mice had injected into their Tibialis anterior (TA) in sterile 0.9% NaCl five days prior to immunization. groups of 6 to 7 mice were immunized with a single 100 g dose of either pCMVcoreIRES, or pCMVcore, or empty vector. ELISA performed on plates coated with core aa 1\u201398, 1\u2013152, or 1\u2013173 showed similar results. immuno serum was considered positive for anti-core antibodies when a specific OD value exceeded, by at least two-fold, the signals generated by: pre-immune serum reacting with core-derived antigen. mice were sacrificed and spleens were obtained two weeks after each immunization in Scheme I. cell stimulation was performed with peptides representing core aa 1\u201320, 23\u201343, 34\u201342 and recombinant core aa 1\u201398, 1\u2013152, and aa 1\u2013173 at dilutions to 3.1, 6.25, 12.5, 25.0, 50.0, and 100 g/ml, all in duplicate. the amplified DNA was cleaved with HindIII/XhoI and inserted into pcDNA3 cleaved with HindIII/XhoI resulting in pCMVcore. the amplified DNA was cleaved with NheI/KspAI and inserted into the plasmid pCMVE2/p7-2 [66] cleaved with NheI/XhoI, resulting in p pcDNA3, pCMVcore, pCMVcoreKozak, and pCMVcoreIRES differed from HCV AD78P1 core in positions 70 (H versus R), 75 (T versus A) and 147 (V versus T), respectively. plasmids were dissolved in the phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and used for in vitro expression assays and for DNA immunization. the percent of transfection was evaluated by counting the number of GFP expressing cells per 500 transfected NIH3T3 cells. cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection, counted, and 104 cells were lysed in 2 SDS Sample buffer. blots were blocked overnight in PBS-T with 5% non-fat dry milk, stained with polyclonal anti-core antibodies #35-6 (1:5000) followed by the secondary anti-rabbit HRP-conju core content per transfected cell was evaluated after accounting for the percent of transfection and normalization to the tubulin content per well. fixed cells were dried, fixed with acetic acid and ethanol (1:3) for 15 min and rinsed thoroughly in distilled water. Scheme II Female 6\u20138 week old BALB/c mice had injected into their Tibialis anterior (TA), 50 l of 0.01 mM cardiotoxin (Latoxan, France) five days prior to immunization. groups of 6 to 7 mice were immunized with a single 100 g dose of either pCMVcoreIRES, or pCMVcore, or pCMVcoreKozak, or empty vector, all dissolved in 100 groups of 6 to 7 mice were immunized with a single 100 g dose of pCMVcoreIRES, or pCMVcore, or pCMVcoreKozak, or empty vector. groups were injected with 100 g of pCMVcoreKozak and boosted three weeks later with 20 g of core aa 1\u201398 in PBS. ELISA performed on plates coated with core aa 1\u201398, 1\u2013152, or 1\u2013173 showed similar results. peptides representing core aa 1\u201320, 23\u201343, 34\u201342 and recombinant core aa 1\u201398, 1\u2013152, and substrate OPD (Sigma, USA) added for color development. spleens were obtained two weeks after each immunization in Scheme I. concanavalin A (ConA) was used as a positive control at 2 g/ml. cells were grown for 72 h, after which [3H]-thymidine (1 Ci per well; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Ireland) was added. pCMVcore and pCMVcoreKozak were used as the templates for the T7-driven mRNA transcription; mRNA was translated in vitro in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system. both mRNAs generated a translation product of approximately 23 kDa corresponding to the molecular mass of unprocessed HCV core (p23; data not shown) next, core-expressing vectors were used to transfect a series of mammalian in BHK-21 cells 48 h (Field 2) and 72 h post transfection (Field 3). transfection with the recommended amount (lane 1), and two-fold excess of transfection reagent (lane 2). a calibration curve was prepared using recombinant core protein aa 1\u2013173 loaded in amounts of 25, 20, 15 and 10 ng per well (lanes 5, 6, 7 and 8 respectively) Western blotting was done using rabbit anti-core antibodies [82] (A) three plasmid injections generated a better T-cell proliferative response to core and core-derived peptides than two. however, the response could not be boosted further. however, no boosting was seen after initial two pCMVcoreKozak injections. c mice are expected to support a better Th2-type response with stronger antibody production. pCMVcore Kozak was given as a single 100 g injection with the effect of repeated intramuscular DNA boosts substituted by pre-treatment of the injection sites by cardiotoxin. a slow increase in the level of anti-core antibodies was observed 35 days after a single gene injection. the levels of core-specific IFN-, IL-2, and IL-4 secretion in the cell culture fluids collected after splenocyte stimulation with HCV core aa 1\u201398 (C) the levels of core-specific IFN-, IL-2, and IL-4 secretion in the cell culture fluids collected after splenocyte stimulation with HCV core aa 133\u2013142 (B) HCV core protein aa 1\u201398 and pCMVcoreKozak were used to immunize BALB/c mice either separately, or in the DNA prime-protein boost regimen. a high titer of core-specific antibodies was achieved only after the heterologous boost. recombinant core aa 1\u2013173, and a peptide covering HCV core aa 133\u2013142 (B); levels of core-specific IFN- and IL-2 secretion (pg/ml) in the pooled cell culture after splenocyte stimulation with pCMVcoreKozak. seroreactvivity in mice immunized with single injection of core or core expressing plasmids. core-immunized mice had no anti-core IgG1 or IgG2. the heterologous core DNA prime/core protein boost regimen preferentially induced anti-core IgG. protein immunization triggered mostly low-level anti-core IgM. the overall level of HCV core synthesis in BHK-21 cells was somewhat higher than in COS-7 cells. all cells expressing core showed cytoplasmic granular staining characteristic of the processed p21 form of HCV core. fluorescent images A1\u20134, B1\u20133, C1\u20133 and A4 were taken with leica DM 6000 B microscope and a Leica DFC 480 camera. expression capacity of the vectors was quantified in murine fibroblasts to reproduce DNA immunization that was to be done in mice. Western blotting was done using rabbit anti-core antibodies [82] (A) images were quantified with ImageJ software http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij. the results of quantification of HCV core expression in four independent experiments. specific IL-4 secretion was not detected in mice receiving 2 (2 25 g), 3 (3 25 g) and 4 (4 25 g) injections of pCMVcoreKozak. the development of core-specific immune responses occurred within six weeks after the on-start of immunization. a slow increase in the level of anti-core antibodies was observed 35 days after a single gene injection as compared to levels detected at day 21. there was no difference between BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice with respect to core-specific IFN- secretion (p > 0.05 Mann Whitney U-test); or core-specific IgG production (p > 0.05 Mann Whitney U-test; Fig. 4A versus Fig. 5A and Additional file 1). BALB/c mice were immunized with a single dose of low-expressing core genes with no translation initiation signals (pCMVcore), or with IRES (pCMVcoreIRES) the highest anti-core IgG response was raised in mice immunized with pCMVcore that directed the lowest level of HCV core expression. the heterologous regimen effectively induced a proliferative response, both in SI values (p levels 0.034, Mann Whitney U-test) and in the number of positive T-cell proliferation tests (p level 0.014; Fig. 6B); and potent core-specific IL-4 secretion. mice immunized with single injection of core or core expressing plasmids had significantly higher levels of anti-core IgG than mice immunized with pCMVcoreKozak. group with heterologous prime/boost regimen had also an increased levels of anti-core IgG1. DNA immunization was performed in mice receiving 2 (2 25 g), 3 (3 25 g) and 4 (4 25 g) injections of pCMVcoreKozak. no specific response was registered after the 1st injection. the development of core-specific immune responses occurred within six weeks after the on-start of immunization. repeated boosts with HCV core gene did not lead to significant enhancement of core-specific immunity. pCMVcore Kozak was given as a single 100 g injection. pCMVcoreKozak (n = 7), pCMVcoreIRES (n = 6), pCMVcore (n = 6), and empty vector (n = 7) the highest anti-core IgG response was raised in mice immunized with pCMVcoreIRES (pCMVcoreIRES) CMVcore directed the lowest level of HCV core expression. it was significantly higher than the antibody response induced by pCMVcoreKozak. immune response in pCMVcoreIRES-immunized mice was intermediate. both DNA immunogens provided similar level of core-specific IFN- secretion. kinetics of IgG response to core aa 1\u201398 measured as the stimulation index (SI);-T-cell proliferation measured as the stimulation index (SI); levels of core-specific IFN- and IL-2 secretion (pg/ml) in the pooled cell culture after splenocyte stimulation with HCV core aa 1\u201398 or aa 1\u2013173 (C) low specific anti-core IgM were observed only in mice immunized with recombinant core aa 1\u201398. core-immunized mice had no anti-core IgG1 or IgG2. protein immunization triggered mostly low-level anti-core IgM. the issue of translation efficacy was assessed in single-dose immunizations. the issue of translation efficacy was assessed in single-dose immunizations with plasmids directing different levels of HCV core expression. ukaryotic cellular and viral mRNAs, also of HCV, include the translation initiation from IRESs. core is tightly involved in the IRES-mediated regulation of HCV translation with several regulatory signals localized in both core protein and core coding sequence. CAP and IRES translation initiation options were employed in design of core DNA immunogens. no significant antibody response has ever been induced in core gene immunization unless it was followed by the protein boost [2,64]. anti-core antibody titers obtained here after immunization with both CAP- and IRES-regulated core genes were also low. thus, the use of highly expressing HCV core DNA did not promote an effective core-specific antibody response. ER- and mitochondrial stress regulates apoptosis [105,106], tumorigenesis [107,108], and induces abnormal lipid metabolism [109]. core expression leads to diverse pathological effects including CD4+ T-cell depletion, liver steatosis, insulin resistance, and hepatocellular carcinoma [33,110]. this points to the necessity to devise alternative immunization regimens that would help circumvent possible adverse effects of HCV core. only the heterologous DNA-prime-protein boost regimen induced a significant core-specific antibody production and potent T-cell response of mainly Th1-profile. this may be beneficial since most correlates of spontaneous HCV clearance are Th1-oriented [32,39,84,85]. proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane and subjected to Western blotting with core-specific rabbit antibodies. signals were registered using X-ray films and ECL detection system. images were saved, scanned, and signal of individual band corresponding to core was quantified by Image J http://rsb.info.nih.gov."}
