{"summary": "the Baltimore Orioles had raised the terror alert level to code orange (high) since 1 March 2004, the department of homeland security had raised the U.S. terror alert level to code orange (high) based on fresh intelligence reports from interviews with al Qaeda detainees at Guantanamo Bay. on Monday, 8 March 2004, 75 diehard baseball fans returned to Dulles Airport on Orioles Airways Flight 000. the condition of Mr. Smith steadily worsened despite aggressive treatment efforts, and he died of respiratory failure on the afternoon of 11 March. by 13 March 2004, a total of 90 cases of SARS were confirmed in Maryland, Pennsylvania, northern Virginia, and the district of Columbia. most cases in this SARS outbreak were traceable to Mr. Smith, the Anytown businessman who had been exposed to SARS while on business in Taipei. the remaining cases were traced to the two travelers to Baltimore who came from Guangdong Province in China. a man driving a van on Any Parkway suddenly stopped at the main entrance to the fairgrounds. ten seconds later the van exploded in a massive fireball, the blast hurling fiery shrapnel into the crowd. the blast could be heard over a 5-mile radius. what steps would be taken to distinguish a dirty bomb vs. from another type of explosion. what steps would be taken to evacuate, contain, and decontaminate the affected area. who would take the lead in communicating timely, accurate information to the public on radiation terror. Mr. Smith flew the next morning, 5 March, from dulles to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on the 8 March Orioles Airways flight 000. he developed a sudden fever and dry cough, along with chills and muscle aches. within 2 hr of arriving at his apartment to his wife and two children in Anytown, his condition rapidly deteriorated and he began to have difficulty breathing. by 13 March 2004, a total of 90 cases of SARS were confirmed in Maryland, Pennsylvania, northern Virginia, and the district of Columbia. twenty of these patients had died thus far from respiratory failure. the news of these deaths brought added fear to the region and the nation. \"dirty bomb\" preparedness and response gathered at the Anywhere County fairgrounds in Anytown, Maryland. the crowds were currently enjoying an outdoor concert and other festivities. a breeze blowing westward at 10 miles/hr, cooling the fairground crowd slightly and making them a little more comfortable. an Associated Press wire bulletin surfaced that three moisture density gauges were first reported missing from a construction site on Mary-land\u2019s eastern Shore. the gauges were last seen on 1 July, the day before the construction crew left the site for the extended holiday weekend. public safety authorities had a high index of suspicion that this terrorist blast may have been caused by a 'dirty bomb' the Haddon matrix is a

meshes concepts of primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention. through its phase-factor approach, the Haddon matrix meshes concepts of primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention. each cell of the matrix represents a distinct locus for identifying strategies to prevent, respond to, or mitigate public health challenges. the Haddon matrix can be applied as a practical, user-friendly interdisciplinary brainstorming and planning tool to help understand, prepare for, and respond to a broad range of public health emergencies. each phase of a public health emergency presents a unique set of demands on health departments in their readiness and response efforts. the Haddon matrix provides a practical, efficient decision-making and planning tool that health department leaders can use to better understand current and emerging threats. the Haddon matrix reveals itself as a useful public health readiness tool for tackling difficult public health emergencies. from diagnosis to treatment, to infection control, to risk communication, SARS is an infectious disease that exacts significant stress on multiple facets of the public health infrastructure. tin et al. 2003: tin et al.

public health emergencies. from diagnosis, to treatment, to infection control, to risk communication, SARS is an infectious disease that exacts significant stress on multiple facets of the public health infrastructure. a myriad of public health response issues surround a SARS outbreak. the Haddon matrix views infectious disease as a form of injury affecting the population on a broad scale. the model allows users to better understand the multidimensional nature of the epidemic and to identify targets for prevention, mitigation, and intervention. the Haddon matrix reveals the importance of addressing the need for adequate personal protective equipment. the model is flexible enough to allow for big picture analysis of a situation, or a more focused analysis of the smallest units of study, including individuals. the Haddon matrix can be applied to the threat of a dirty bomb. a closer look reveals a more specific set of points for targeting environmental assessment and intervention. a comparison between the dirty bomb and SARS Haddon matrix shows marked similarities. public health infrastructure faces new and significant challenges of recognizing and responding to a broad range of intentional and naturally occurring large-scale threats. effective public health emergency preparedness and response requires appropriate preevent, event (crisis phase) and postevent (consequence phase) activities. items with asterisks on Table 2 are CDC-adopted emergency preparedness competencies for all public health workers. each phase of a public health emergency presents a unique set of demands on health departments in their readiness and response efforts. each phase of a public health emergency presents a unique set of demands in their readiness and response efforts. based on the health department\u2019s unique demands and resources, the Haddon matrix can also serve as a helpful after-action evaluation tool. a view of readiness challenges through the lens of the Haddon matrix also promotes efficient use of public health resources. the matrix can reveal strategies that allow multiple issues to be addressed by one solution. a myriad of public health response issues surround a SARS outbreak. this model of the Haddon matrix views infectious disease as a form of injury affecting the population on a broad scale. the model allows its users to better understand the multidimensional nature of the epidemic. hospital infection control protocols Availability of designated SARS hospitals in vicinity Budget (response resource utilization) Isolation and quarantine implementation Communication network systems capacity Incident command system put into action* Risk communication during event to staff and patients* Moral support to affected health care community* Patient and family compliance with hospital infection control protocols Postevent Postevent risk communication Persistence of agent in environment. the Haddon matrix can be applied to the threat of a dirty bomb. a closer look reveals a more specific set of points for targeting environmental assessment and intervention. the Haddon matrix for dirty bombs in Table 4 reveals the host, social environmental/organizational culture. don matrix examples show significant similarities in the importance of risk communication, mental health support, resource use, surge capacity, and effective surveillance as points of public health impact. the 'impact' opportunities for dirty bomb preparedness and response involve mainly organizational culture/social environment factors, as well as a few host and physical environment factors. the legal and regulatory aspects of environmental remediation after a dirty bomb are critical public health issues. the Haddon matrix provides a framework for understanding a terrorism incident in a temporal context, including its preevent, event (crisis) and postevent (consequence) phases. it can effectively dissect these temporal phases of a public health event into their contributing factors. it can aid in a public health agency\u2019s vulnerability assessment of its preparedness and response capacities."}
