{"summary": "the filovirus family includes the major genera ebolavirus and marburgvirus and the newly discovered cuevavirus. in the ebolavirus genus, there is one species, the eponymously named marburg virus (MARV) in the marburgvirus genus, there is one species, the eponymously named marburg virus (MARV) MARV is further subdivided into different strains, including Ci67, Musoke, Ravn and angola GP1 contains the putative receptor-binding region [14], as well as two heavily glycosylated domains. a glycan cap sits immediately atop the putative receptor-binding site and a larger, largely unstructured mucin-like domain. the mucin-like domains contain a dense clustering of N- and O-linked glycans. monoclonal antibody cocktails are most effective when mAbs display synergistic effects. monoclonal cocktail is composed entirely of antibodies that are not potent neutralizers. anti-EBOV oligoclonal cocktail is composed entirely of antibodies not potent neutralizers. GP1-mucin-deleted immunogens were used to direct the immune response away from the highly variable mucin-like domains. ten antibodies were chosen and analyzed for in vitro neutralization and biochemical recognition of MARV and EBOV GPs. antibodies were generated from a single immunogen with the exception of 54G1, 54G2 and 54G3. ELISA EC50 values against different forms of purified MARV Ravn GP or against VLPs in ng/ml. no binding at 10g/ml maximum mAb concentration is represented by >. 8 mAbs bind as well (or nearly as well) to VLPs as purified MARV Ravn GP. 2A12 exhibits nearly 10-fold weaker binding to VLPs than to GP ectodomain. 54G3 binding to VLPs is lost at the highest concentration tested. pepscan identified linear epitopes for only four mAbs, 30G3, 30G4, 30G5 and 54G2, all of which overlap within residues 451\u2013471. binding to GPmucw is lost for only the four anti-wing mAbs, while the remaining six mAbs against different epitopes do bind GPmucw. in vitro neutralization Antibodies were screened for in vitro neutralization. six of the ten mAbs exhibit partial neutralization at the highest concentration tested (50ug/ml), reducing entry by 35\u201355%. only one GP1-directed mAb inhibits entry of Ravn GP pseudovirions. VSVG MARV Ravn GP was incubated with 50g/ml of the indicated mAb for 1 hour before infection. positive control is human survivor mAb MR78. two separate studies were performed, with half of the mAbs repeated in both studies. treatment groups are broken up into 3 or 4 mAbs to simplify survival and health score graphs. studies continued for 28 days total, however no additional changes were observed beyond day 14. cross-reactivity with ebolavirus GPs two of the highly cross-reactive MARV antibodies, mAbs 40G1 and 2D8, exhibit binding to EBOV GP. 1 and 2D8 mAbs to GP antigens determined by ELISA at 5g/ml. MARV GPmuc, MARV GPcl, and EBOV GPcl curves overlay in both graphs. representative 2D class averages of MARV Ravn GP:Fab complexes (A) GPmuc + 9A11 (B) GPmuc + 30G5 (C) GP + 30G5 (D) Fab complexes are shown with a dashed orange line. footprints of 9A11 and 30G5 Fabs are unknown; possible binding areas are highlighted by gray dotted ovals. EC50 values are indicated by orange highlight (high, EC50 20ng/ml), dark yellow (medium, EC50 20-200ng/ml), or light yellow (low, EC50 >200ng/ml) no binding at 10g/ml maximum mAb concentration is represented by >. all mAbs exhibit medium binding (EC50 between 20ng/ml and 200ng/ml, colored dark yellow) but only seven of the mAbs cross-re 2A12 exhibits nearly 10-fold weaker binding to VLPs than GP ectodomain. 54G3 binding to VLPs is lost at the highest concentration tested. GP schematic and GP2-wing epitope analysis. binding to GPmucw is lost for only the four anti-wing mAbs. the remaining six mAbs against different epitopes do bind GPmucw. no definitive epitope information could be identified by pepscan. in vitro neutralization Antibodies were screened for in vitro neutralization. six of the ten mAbs exhibit partial neutralization at the highest concentration tested (50ug/ml), reducing entry by 35\u201355%. only one GP1-directed mAb inhibits entry of Ravn GP pseudovirions. mAbs against the GP2 wing were found to be moderately or highly protective. mAbs against the GP2 core exhibited 0\u201340% survival. mice in all treatment groups displayed an elevation of disease score by Day 4. treatment groups are broken up into 3 or 4 mAbs to simplify survival and health score graphs. studies continued for 28 days total, however no additional changes were observed beyond day 14. cross-reactivity with ebolavirus GPs is 0%. MARV GPmuc, MARV GPcl, and EBOV GPcl curves overlay in both graphs. the most protective anti-GP1 (9A11) and anti-GP2 (30G5) antibodies were performed in complex with purified antigen. a small panel of mAbs targeting MARV GP were isolated from immunized mice. this wing region is a MARV-specific portion of the mucin-like domain attached to GP2. this epitope does not exist in ebolaviruses because the entire mucin-like domain is attached to GP1. anti-EBOV neutralizing antibodies KZ52 [15], 2G4 and 4G7 [46], as well as the anti-SUDV mAb 16F6 [47] may block access to this site on the GP core. the most protective of these mAbs is promising but only binds with high affinity to the GP from Ravn. no cross-filovirus anti-GP antibody has yet been elicited by an ebolavirus GP immunogen. no cross-filovirus anti-GP antibody has yet been elicited by an ebolavirus GP immunogen. a highly conserved epitope would likely be less subject to antigenic escape. one anti-EBOV cocktail is composed entirely of non-neutralizing or weakly neutralizing mAbs, yet still confers in vivo protection. in this study, none of the mAbs offered significant in vitro neutralization, yet several did confer partial to complete in vivo protection against MARV one hour after challenge. a core mAb such as 40G1 (or a neutralizing MR mAb), the anti-GP1 mAb 9A11 (or a neutralizing MR mAb), and an anti-GP2 wing mAb such as 30G4 or 30G5. future studies will determine the limits of protection and therapeutic potential of these antibodies. uc was then isolated by S200 size exclusion chromatography (SEC) in 10 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5 (1x TBS) bulky hydrophobic residues near the furin cleavage site were mutated. mice were immunized intramuscularly (IM) three times with 50 g purified MARV GPs in Glucopyranosyl Lipid Adjuvant (GLA) adjuvant at 2 week intervals. boosted intravenously (IV) with 50 g antigen 3 days before harvest of spleen/lymph nodes. Mice immunized with angola GPmuc yielded antibody 2D8. production of 9A11 Immunization of mice was performed by bio-Quant Inc. the cleaved ectodomain of EBOV (EBOV GPcl) was produced by incubating 1mg EBOV GPemuc with 0.01 mg trypsin (Sigma) overnight at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour in TBS buffer plus 1mM CaCl2. the cleaved ectodomain was produced by incubating 1mg EBOV GPemuc with 0.02mg thermolysin mAbs were tested for binding to GP (1\u2013636), GPmuc (1\u2013636 257\u2013463) and GPcl of MARV Ravn. binding in Fig 1C is reported as high, medium, or low rather than as a quantitative EC50 value. microtiter plates were coated with filovirus GP antigens. they were blocked with 3% BSA in PBS 1 hour at RT. plates were then incubated with 1:2000 goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) HRP conjugated secondary (Thermo Scientific) in 0.3% BSA 1 hour at RT. Pseudovirions were incubated with anti-VSV G mAb (a gift from A. Takada) for 1 hour at RT, then incubated with 50 g/ml of each anti-MARV GP mAb in DMEM-10% FBS (Gibco) for an additional hour at RT. after 48 hours, infection was evaluated by counting GFP-expressing cells. animals were weighed and monitored daily over a 28 day period post-challenge. once animals were symptomatic, they were examined twice per day. health scores for the 54G3 and 2A12 treatment groups in Fig 4 are shown. copper mesh grids were cleaned for 20 sec (Gatan) and stained for 30 sec with 4 L of 2% uranyl formate. the stain was blotted off the edge and the grid was allowed to dry. data were automatically collected using a FEI Tecnai F20 electron microscope. c ectodomain (residues 1\u2013636 with a mucin deletion of residues 257\u2013425) was cloned into a derivative of the Invitrogen pDisplay vector. in this derivative vector, the PGDFR sequence is replaced by a C-terminal purification tag. angola GPmuc was produced by baculovirus infection (Bac-to-Bac, Invitrogen) of Sf9 cells. DNA encoding the MARV GPmuc ectodomain was cloned into a derivative pDisplay plasmid containing a C-terminal HA-tag. Ravn GPmuc mutations included W438L, W439A, F445G, F447N and Angola GPmuc mutations included W439V, M444A, F445G. angola GPmuc (IBT) antigens used to raise antibodies at IBT were produced at IBT. mice were immunized intramuscularly (IM) three times with 50 g purified MARV GPs in Glucopyranosyl Lipid Adjuvant (GLA) adjuvant. boosted intravenously (IV) with 50 g antigen 3 days before harvest of spleen/lymph nodes for fusions. immunoization of mice at IBT was performed according to AUP approved by Noble Life Sciences IACUC. six week-old BALB/c mice were injected subcutaneously (SC) with 20 g of purified Ci67 GPmuc in CFA. additional boosts were injected intraperitoneally (IP) on day 32 and 56. mice were immunized intramuscularly (IM) three times with 50 g purified MARV GPs in Glucopyranosyl Lipid Adjuvant (GLA) adjuvant. boosted intravenously (IV) with 50 g antigen 3 days before harvest of spleen/lymph nodes for fusions. MS were produced at TSRI in Drosophila S2 cells [16], with the exception of Musoke GP. Effectene Reagent (Qiagen) was used to transfect S2 cells with pMTpuro plasmids containing a strep-tagged filovirus GP gene of interest. secreted GP ectodomain expression was induced with 0.5mM CuSO4 and supernatants harvested after 4 days. mAbs were tested for binding to GP (1\u2013636), GPmuc (1\u2013636 257\u2013463) and GPcl of MARV Ravn at a concentration range of 10g/ml to 0.01ng/ml using 10-fold serial dilutions. mAbs were tested for binding to MARV Angola, Musoke, Ci67, and muc. EBOV GP (1\u2013636) at 10, 1, 0.1 and 0.01g/ml. binding in Fig 1C is reported as high, medium, or low. antibodies 2D8 and 40G1 were further analyzed for binding to GPmuc antigens. pepscan was repeated for mAbs 9A11, 2A12, 2D8 and 40G1 against peptides designed from Musoke GP sequences. GP2 wing-directed antibodies were further evaluated for binding to both wild-type Ravn GPmuc and Ravn GPmuc containing a point mutant (E465K) purified filovirus GP antigen preparation All filovirus ectodomains for ELISA, western blot, EM, or DXMS were produced at TSRI in Drosophila S2 cells [16] with the exception of Musoke GP, which was produced by IBT in Sf9 cells. VLPs pelleted down at 13,000 xg for 90 minutes, washed with PBS. pellets then gently resuspended in PBS containing 0.1% NP40 and 0.1% Triton X100. used as coating antigen for ELISA. mAbs were tested for binding to MARV Angola, Musoke, Ci67, and EBOV GP (1\u2013636) at 10, 1, 0.1 and 0.01g/ml. binding in Fig 1C is reported as high, medium, or low rather than a quantitative EC50 value. pepscan was repeated for mAbs 9A11, 2A12, 2D8 and 40G1 against peptides designed from Musoke GP sequences. additional ELISAs were performed with a MARV GP lacking both the GP1 MLD (257\u2013425) and the GP2 wing (436\u2013483). s were added to vero cell monolayers in 96-well plates at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) between 0.01 and 0.03. all mammalian cell lines used in this study tested negative for mycoplasma contamination at TSRI. all BALB/c mice used in these experiments were obtained from the Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, National Cancer Institute (Frederick, MD) each treatment group was compared to the corresponding PBS control for either Study #1 or #2. Graphpad Prism 6.0 software was used to calculate P values using the Log-rank Mantel Cox test. each treatment group was compared to the corresponding PBS control for either Study #1 or #2. P values > 0.05 are considered non-significant (ns) images were acquired at a constant defocus value of -1.3 m at various tilt angles from 0 to 50\u00b0. Particles were picked automatically using DoG Picker [55] and placed into a particle stack using the Appion software [56] reference-free 2D class averages were calculated by using particles binned by 2 with the Xmipp Clustering 2D Alignment software. 2 wing is solvent exposed, and likely unstructured."}
