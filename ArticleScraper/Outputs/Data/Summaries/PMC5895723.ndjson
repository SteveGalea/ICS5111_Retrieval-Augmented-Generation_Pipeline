{"summary": "more than 3.1 million deaths due to pneumonia and meningitis were estimated to have occurred in 2015. bacteria are the leading cause of serious disease and deaths. bacteria are the leading cause of serious disease and deaths. a bacterial pathogen-MS panel (BP-MS) was developed to screen 11 key bacterial pathogens associated with pneumonia and meningitis. real-time PCR and nested PCR were used to confirm the results. 46 stock nasopharyngeal swabs were determined positive for target pathogens and used in the validation stage. bacterial pellets were resuspended in 150 l of enzyme cocktail containing 30 U of lysostaphin, 6 mg of lysozyme, 37.5 U of mutanolysin, and 30 U of lyticase. the resuspended bacteria were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. primary multiplex PCR and dephosphorylation reaction Twelve pairs of PCR primers were pooled and then mixed with hot start PCR enzyme, PCR buffer, MgCl2 (Agena Bioscience, Inc.), uracil-DNA glycosylase (ShineGene Molecular Biotechnology, Shanghai, China), dNTP (dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dUTP) real-time PCR and nested PCR methods were used as confirmatory tests. each sample was tested in duplicate and regarded as positive if both cycle threshold (CT) values were 40. infection samples and single-infection samples were 2-tested. p-value 0.05 was considered statistically significant. ethics approval The study was performed in accordance with the recommendations of national ethics regulations and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Institute of Pathogen Biology. 20 l of proteinase K and 200 l of buffer AL (QIAgen, Hilden, Germany) were added. the mixture was incubated for 20 min at 56\u00b0C and then 15 min at 95\u00b0C. multiplex PCR was performed in 384-well PCR plates using a ProFlex PCR system. reaction conditions for the multiplex PCR were as follows: 45\u00b0C for 2 min; 94\u00b0C for 4 min; 95\u00b0C for 2 min; 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 30 s, 56.5\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 5 min. multiplex real-time PCR was used according to previously published methods. each sample was tested in duplicate and regarded as positive. nested PCR was designed in-house for this study. the final target genes and assays are listed in Table S1 in the Supplementary Material. the BP-MS method can be used to accurately identify the expected bacteria without cross-reactivity with non-target pathogens. 204 nasal and throat swabs were collected to evaluate the performance of the BP-MS method. each of the 11 target pathogens was detected, with an overall detection rate of 81.9% (167/204). the rate of infection with multiple pathogens was 55.7% (93/167). all combinations of multiple infections that were verified by confirmatory tests in this study are listed in Table 3. Thirty-one BP-MS-positive samples were not verified by either real-time PCR or nested PCR. of these, 14 were single-infection samples and 17 were multiple-infection samples. moraxella catarrhalis 27 (13.2) 24/27 88.9 2 26 96.3 Legionella pneumophila 2 (1) 1/2 50 0 1 50 Mycoplasma pneumoniae 25 (12.3) 21/25 84 1 22 88 Bordetella pertussis 3 (1.5) 3/3 100 0 3 100 Totala 167(81.9) 77/167 46.1 59 136 81.4 a The total number of clinical samples is 204.

(2010). nearly half of pneumonia cases, in which no causative agents can be detected. the BP-MS method is a powerful tool that can be used for pathogen screening and may provide valuable information for antibiotic selection in early stages of disease. authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
