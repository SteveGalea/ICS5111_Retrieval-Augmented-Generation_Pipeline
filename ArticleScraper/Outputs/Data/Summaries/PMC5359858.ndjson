{"summary": "a total of 15 blood samples from pregnant women at eight weeks of pregnancy were collected, and plasma DNA was extracted. the positive reaction was highly specific only with samples containing XY chromosomes, while no amplification was found in samples containing XX chromosomes. the position of the testis-determining gene has been narrowed down to a 35,000-base-pair region of the Y chromosome located near the tip of the short arm (3). a male-specific DNA sequence was found that could encode a peptide of 223 amino acids. this peptide is probably a transcription factor, since it contains a DNA-binding domain called the HMG (high-mobility group) box. ion of amplification product can be determined via turbidity caused by an increasing quantity of magnesium pyrophosphate precipitate in solution (26\u201336). amplification product can be determined via turbidity caused by an increasing quantity of the magnesium pyrophosphate precipitate in solution (26\u201336) agarose gel electrophoresis confirms extraction quality of nucleic acid. nucleic acid stained with ethidium bromide. purity of DNA estimated by measuring absorbance values at 260 nm and 280 nm. primers were tested for similarities with other sequences available in the GenBank databases using the BLASTN algorithm. DNA was added to 23 l of LAMP mixture to provide a final concentration of 20 mM supplied buffer. 0.5 l ethidium bromide (Sigma) and 2 l SYBR\u00ae Premix Ex TaqTM II (Perfect Real-time, Takara Bio Co., Ltd., RR081A) were added separately from a stock solution to the master mix. a total of 15 blood samples from pregnant women at eight weeks of pregnancy were collected. another set of blood samples from non-pregnant women and men were also obtained using them as plasma negative and positive controls. a basic set of four primers was needed, including FIP (Forward Inner Primer), BIP (Backward Inner Primer), F3 (Forward Outer Primer) and B3 (Backward Outer Primer) to identify six distinct regions on the target DNA. to accelerate the LAMP reaction, two additional primers, i.e., LF (Loop Forward Primer) and LB (Loop Backward Primer) were also used. dNTP, 0.2 M of primer F3 and B3, 0.4 M of primer LF and LB, 0.8 M of primer FIP and BIP and 8 U of Bst DNA polymerase. tubes were then incubated at 63\u00b0C for 60 min in water bath. an agarose gel electrophoresis system under UV illumination could be also employed to visualize positive reaction. 1 l of the hydroxynaphthol blue dye (HNB) (3 mM, Lemongreen, Shanghai, China), 1 l of phenol red (diluted to 1:10 with 6loading buffer) were separately added from a stock solution to the master mix. 0.5 l ethidium bromide (Sigma) and 2 l SYBR\u00ae Premix Ex TaqTM II were easily monitored for color change by simply looking at them in daylight. agarose gel electrophoresis pattern of LAMP amplicons on 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis was only observed for the positive samples and positive control. a total of 15 blood samples from pregnant women were seven male embryos (46.6%) and eight female embryos (53.4%) the absorbance ratios (A260/A280) of DNA samples were found to be in range of 1.68\u20131.73, indicating the purity of DNA. the reaction mixture was incubated at temperatures ranging from 60 to 65\u00b0C. the optimal temperature was found to be 63\u00b0C for 60 min. negative samples, lane and tube N: non-pregnant women sample and, lane and tube P: men sample (positive control) amplicons could be detected with the naked eye by adding different visual dyes followed by color changing in the solutions. positive results by MgSO4, Gene-FinderTM, SYBR Green I, HNB, phenol red, Gel-RedTM, ethidium bromide and SYBR\u00ae Premix Ex TaqTM II were turbidity, green the presence of LAMP positive amplicons proved to be confirmed by adding a number of fluorescent or metal dyes to the reaction tubes. despite the precise detection of positive LAMP products using all dyes, some were significantly superior when the time of stability, cost and the safety were taken into consideration. color change can be a significant problem as long as just a few numbers of suspicious samples are used, most of the time inaccurate results will be accordingly achieved (29\u201335). the method, however, could be attributed as a reliable visual observation approach since on the one hand, it is exploited prior to the reaction and on the other hand, there is no need for toxic devices. the visual inspection of LAMP products by means of HNB and GeneFinderTM metal dyes was seen as advantageous as there was no need for electrophoresis and subsequent staining with carcinogenic ethidium bromide (40). turbidity caused by precipitation of MgSO4 or SYBR\u00ae Premix Ex TaqTM II was stable for only 5\u201310 s and 1\u20133 days, respectively. friendly LAMP with gel detection Gel electrophoresis No Yes Yes High Colorimetric LAMP without UV Visual Yes No No Very low Very low Colorimetric LAMP with UV Visual No No No Very low Very low Very low Colorimetric LAMP with UV Visual No No No Very low Very low Very low Colorimetric LAMP with UV Visual No No No Very low smear and/or ladder band only in male blood samples, but not in female samples."}
