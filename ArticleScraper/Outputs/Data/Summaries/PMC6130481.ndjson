{"summary": "the developed HPTLC chromatograms are useful in identification of biomarkers in various herbal formulations by comparing the fingerprints with standards. it is widely used for the identification, purity testing, stability, dissolution or content uniformity of crude extracts of plant and animal origin, fermentation mix, drugs and excipients. the plant extract has shown to have antioxidative (Bouchet & Barrier 1998), anti-inflammatory (Sombi\u00e9 et al. 2011) and acaricidal (Osman et al. 2014) activities. recently, we demonstrated in vitro anti-hepatitis B virus efficacy of G. senegalensis leaves extract. the plant material was authenticated by Prof. Ismail Mirghani, a taxonomist at the Forestry Research Center (FRC), Khartoum, Sudan, where a voucher specimen (No. 891) was deposited. further authentication was confirmed at the herbarium of College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Saudi Arabia. CAMAG Automatic TLC Sampler-4 (Switzerland) was used to apply the biomarkers and GSEE, band wise to the chromatographic plates. the developed HPTLC Plates were then documented by CAMAG TLC Reprostar 3 and scanned by CAMAG CATS 4 (Switzerland) the dilutions of naringenin and gallic acid ranging from 10 to 120 g/mL (10 L, each) were applied to NP-HPTLC plate to furnish the linearity range of 100\u20131200 ng/band. the results were evaluated in terms of accuracy and robustness. in RP-HPTLC method, the different mobile phases were prepared from acetonitrile: water (4:6, v/v) in different proportions (3.8:6.2, v/v and 4.2:5.8, v/v) and analyzed. the volume used for saturation was also varied from 20 to 18 and 22 mL. extracts were pooled, filtered (Whatmann filter paper No. 1) and dried under reduced pressure using rotary evaporator (R-210, BUCHI) biomarkers (rutin, quercetin, naringenin and gallic acid) were procured from BDH (UK), HPLC grade ethanol and methanol were procured from Merk (Germany) the developed and dried RP-HPTLC and NP-HPTLC plates were quantitatively analyzed at 360 and 275 nm in absorbance mode. the stocks of rutin, quercetin, naringenin and gallic acid were prepared in methanol (1 mg/mL) the precision was recorded as Mean SD, %RSD and SEM of each calibration level. recovery as accuracy studies involved the addition of a known amount of analyte to a sample, and determining the percentage of added analyte. the robustness study was performed in replicate analysis (n = 6) for all the markers at 300 ng/band concentration. results Method development The mobile phase used in RP- and NP-HPTLC analyses was selected by testing several compositions of different solvents. of these, combination of acetonitrile and water (4:6, v/v) under chamber saturation condition was found to be the best mobile phase for the development and quantitative analysis of rutin and quercetin. this method exhibited the clear separation of the two biomarkers along with the different constituents of GSEE. those of naringenin and gallic acid were recorded at Rf 0.56 0.009 and 0.28 0.006 respectively. the developed methods were thus, found quite selective with a good baseline resolution. the intra- and inter-day precision (n = 6) for the proposed methods were recorded as %RSD and SEM for rutin and quercetin (Table 4), and for naringenin and gallic acid (Table 5). the observed low values of %RSD and SEM indicated the good precision of both methods. theoretical concentration of rutin (ng/mL) Concentration of rutin found (ng/mL) SD %RSD SEM % Recovery Percent (%) of rutin added to analyte 0 200 197.481.54 0.781 0.629 98.74 50 300 297.091.75 0.590 0.715 99.03 100 400 396.552.92 0.737 1.194 99.13 150 500 498.062.96 0.595 0 200 197.182.11 1.073 0.863 98.59 50 300 298.063.46 1.162 1.413 99.35 100 400 397.125.18 1.305 2.115 99.28 150 500 499.626.99 1.399 2.854 99.92 Table 4.
