{"summary": "mice were immunized with DNA encoding for MERS-CoV S protein. recombinant purified S protein and polyclonal titers were monitored. monoclonal antibodies were isolated by conventional hybridoma methodology. anti-MERS-CoV S monoclonal antibodies were first captured using a biosensor. a second antibody was allowed to bind to the anti-MERS-CoV antibody (step 3). a second antibody was allowed to bind to the anti-MERS-CoV antibody. the dissociation of bound MERS-CoV RBD from the captured mAb was monitored for 30 min. the real-time binding of REGN3048 (C) and REGN3051 (D) to MERS-CoV RBD is plotted in black line. antibody binding to MERS-CoV-RBD protein was determined by real-time surface plasmon resonance. both antibodies exhibit tight binding to the recombinant S protein with equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) values ranging from 43\u201348 pM at 37 \u00b0C. both antibodies can block cell entry of pseudoparticles at picomolar concentrations. entry of MERSpp was not affected by an isotype control antibody used at up to 10-fold higher concentrations. s of antibodies were incubated with a defined amount of the clinical isolate MERS-CoV strain EMC/2012 (1). both REGN3051 and REGN3048 exhibited potent inhibitory activity against MERS-CoV, with IC50 values of 460 pM and 180 pM respectively. RNA viruses encode a low-fidelity genome replication machinery that allows them to rapidly adapt to their host environment. we used site-directed mutagenesis to create plasmid constructs encoding for all S protein variants. we then used these to generate MERSpp pseudotyped with modified S proteins. similar values were also observed for REGN3048, with exception of the V534A variant, which exhibited partial resistance to the antibody. a_25 Buraidah_1 EMC/2012 FRA/UAE Hafr-Al-Batin_1 Hafr-Al-Batin_2 Hafr-Al-Batin_6 Jeddah_1 Jordan-N3/2012 Munich Riyadh_3 Riyadh_4 Riyadh_14 Taif_1 Wadi-Ad-Dawasir_1 Amino acids 367 three groups have used in vitro antibody isolation methods to select for antibodies that bind to MERS-CoV S protein and block virus entry. the published sequences for antibodies 3B12, MERS-4, and MERS-27 were cloned onto human IgG1 constant domains, then expressed and purified similarly to REGN3051 and REGN3048. mice expressing human DPP4 in place of mouse DPP4 are not susceptible to MERS-CoV infection. expression of human DPP4 in mouse cells allows for MERSpp entry and MERS-CoV propagation. humanized huDPP4 mice intranasally inoculated mice with 2 105 pfu of MERS-CoV. lungs were homogenized, clarified by centrifugation, and titered. RNA quantification demonstrated high levels of MERS-CoV replicating RNA in lungs. huDPP4 mice intranasally inoculated with either MERS-CoV or sham infected with PBS were quantified by TCID50 assay. at day 2 postinfection, peri-bronchiolar inflammation was evident with alterations in bronchiolar cell structure found throughout the lungs. culature (10 magnification), and interstitium (40 magnification) are shown for PBS, day 2 and day 4 postinfection mice. no inflammation is found around either capillaries or neurons in infected mice. REGN3051 was more effective at reducing MERS-CoV RNA levels at the 20-g dose compared with REGN3048 at the same dose. both the 200- and 20-g dose of REGN3051 reduces virus levels to near the level of detection in the assay (1 105 pfu/g) d by plaque assay reported as plaque-forming unit per gram lung. n = 5 mice per time point and titers performed in triplicate. histological analysis was also performed on lungs from mice treated 24 h preinfection with hIgG isotype control antibody. REGN3051 and REGN3048 can block MERS-CoV infection and disease in vivo. mice were intraperitoneally injected with 500 g of hIgG isotype control. mice were killed and mice were analyzed for viral RNA, virus titer, and lung pathology. type control at 1 dpi or with 200 g of REGN3051 at 24 h preinfection. at 4 dpi, lungs were harvested and viral RNA and virus titer quantified. all samples were compared with hIgG1 control treated mice. mice were immunized with DNA encoding for MERS-CoV S protein. recombinant purified S protein and polyclonal titers were monitored. supernatants containing antibodies were screened for binding to purified MERS-CoV-S-RBD. the ability of these antibodies to block entry of retrovirus particles pseudotyped with MERS-CoV S protein was then quantified. all lead antibodies were subsequently cloned on to hIgG1 Fc regions, sequenced, expressed in CHO cells, and purified for further characterization. REGN3048 (A) or REGN3051 (B) was first captured using AHC Octet biosensor (step 1), followed by a blocking step to saturate the unoccupied AHC sensors (step 2). Finally, MERS-CoV-RBD precomplexed with second antibody was allowed to bind to the AHC captured anti\u2013MERS-CoV antibody (step 3), which is shown in the respective insets. 3048 REGN3051 Isotype control mAb No mAb REGN3048 2.19 0.22 0.55 1.03 0.96 REGN3051 2.08 0.68 0.22 0.73 0.69 Binding of the precomplex of MERS-RBD-mFc and anti-MERS-CoV antibody to the AHC Octet biosensor captured antibody is tabulated. no competition between antibodies suggests distinct binding epitopes and is shown in boldface. binding signal observed for self-competition is a result of nonspecific binding of anti-MERS-CoV antibody to unoccupied AHC capture surface. no competition between antibodies suggests distinct binding epitopes. surface plasomon resonance studies were performed to determine binding kinetics of our monoclonal antibodies to MERS-CoV-RBD protein. Kinetics of REGN3051 and REGN3048 binding to MERS-CoV-RBD mAb captured Binding kinetics at 37 \u00b0C mAb capture level (RU) 10 nM MERS-RBD-mFc bound (RU) ka (1/Ms) kd (1/s) KD (M) t1/2 (min) are indicated. live MERS-CoV is neutralized by REGN3048 and REGN3051 in vitro. luciferase expressing particles pseudotyped with either MERS-CoV S (A) or VSV-G (B) were incubated with either antibody. at 72 h postinfection, cells were analyzed for viability. RNA viruses encode a low-fidelity genome replication machinery. but coronaviruses encode for a nonstructural protein with a 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 exo-ribonuclease activity. despite that finding, sequencing of multiple clinical isolates has revealed that the MERS-CoV S protein of the virus is evolving. this amino acid change was only observed in a single MERS-CoV isolate (Riyadh_2) which was isolated in 2012. it is part of a dead branch of the MERS-CoV evolutionary tree (31). Isolates harboring the identified A431P, S457G, S460F, A482V, L506F, D509G, and V534A substitution are shown. luciferase-expressing particles pseudotyped with the indicated variants of the MERS-CoV S protein were incubated with antibodies at the various concentrations. Isolates harboring the identified A431P, S457G, S460F, A482V, L506F, D509G, and V534A substitution are shown. phage display (26, 27) and yeast display (32) have used in vitro antibody isolation methods to select for antibodies that bind to MERS-CoV S protein and block virus entry. we tested the three purified antibodies for binding to MERS S protein, blockade of the S protein\u2013DPP4 interaction, and published neutralization properties. we then tested the neutralization efficacy of all five antibodies using pseudoparticles generated with the prototypical EMC/2012 sequence. both 3B12 and MERS-27 appear to bind to less conserved sites on the MERS-CoV S protein. the resulting mice express fully human DPP4 under the control of the mouse regulatory elements. immunohistochemistry was performed to confirm huDPP4 expression in the lungs of huDPP4 mice. real-time PCR using primers specific to MERS-CoV. lungs were homogenized, clarified by centrifugation, and titered. RNA quantification demonstrated high levels of MERS-CoV replicating RNA in lungs. Lungs from huDPP4 mice intranasally inoculated with either MERS-CoV or sham infected with PBS were analyzed for pathological changes. at day 2 postinfection, peri-bronchiolar inflammation was evident. at 4 dpi, significant interstitial infiltration was observed with peri-vascular cuffing and extensive alveolar thickening. huDPP4 mice were injected with 200, 20, or 2 g of either REGN3051, REGN3048 or 200 g of hIgG1 isotype control antibody 24 h before intranasal infection with 1 105 pfu of MERS-CoV. both REGN3051 and REGN3048 were able to significantly decrease MERS-CoV specific RNA levels in the lungs by over 2 logs at the 200 g dose compared with huDPP4 mice were treated with a dose range of REGN3051 and REGN3048 monoclonal antibodies at 24 h preinfection. at 4 dpi, lungs were harvested and viral RNA and virus titer quantified. or REGN3051 reduced inflammation with minimal foci of inflammatory cells in the interstitium and minor bronchiolar cuffing. in mice pretreated with 20 g of REGN3048 and REGN3051, we found moderate levels of interstitial inflammation compared with the higher antibody group. blinded histological scoring reflects the reduced inflammation scores for treated mice. at 4 dpi, mice were killed and mouse lungs were analyzed for viral RNA, virus titer, and lung pathology. both the 500- and 200-g doses of REGN3051 were able to reduce viral RNA levels by about 10-fold in the lungs of mice compared with control antibody treated mice. histological analysis was performed on mice treated 24 h postinfection with hIgG control antibody, 500 g REGN3051, or 200 g REGN3051. mice treated with either 200 or 500 g of REGN3051 had minimal interstitial inflammation and with reduced and only focal peri-vascular inflammation throughout the lungs. multi purified monoclonal antibodies are currently in preclinical and clinical development for use as antimicrobials (36). these antibodies bind to the MERS-CoV RBD, block the interaction of the S protein with its cellular receptor DPP4 and very potently neutralize MERS-CoV infectivity. two other mouse models have been developed for MERS-CoV. the first model used an adenovirus delivery of huDPP4 into a mouse. this resulted in many cells expressing the huDPP4 receptor and efficient MERS-CoV replication. the rapid identification, purification, and testing of monoclonal antibodies from the VelociGene system (37, 38) allowed for the production of antibodies that are >1 log better inhibitors compared with other published antibodies developed with conventional approaches. the rapid identification, purification, and testing of monoclonal antibodies from the VelocImmune system (37, 38) allowed for the production of antibodies that are >1 log better inhibitors compared with other published antibodies developed with conventional approaches.
