{"summary": "CD200 is a membrane glycoprotein capable of inducing signaling in cells expressing its cognate cell surface receptor, the CD200 receptor (CD200R) both CD200 and CD200R are single transmembrane type 1 proteins of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily. both CD200 and CD200R are single transmembrane type 1 proteins of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily and possess two extracellular Ig-like domains. increased CD200 expression by tumor cells is thought to allow for enhanced growth and survival. the CD200/CD200R pathway has also been found to be an important regulator of host immune responses during in vivo infection with a variety of pathogens. s simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infection in mice also suggest that CD200R may be capable of directly impacting viral replication independently of its effects on inflammatory responses. some pathogens have been shown to affect expression levels of CD200 and CD200R in vivo. some viruses encode homologues of cellular CD200 capable of regulating CD200R signaling. rhesus macaque rhadinovirus (RRV) is a gammaherpesvirus of rhesus macaques (RM) that is closely related to HHV-8 and encodes a vCD200 homologue with similarity to HHV-8 vCD200. the full-length form of RRV vCD200 exists as a membrane-bound molecule and possesses two extracellular IgG domains, a transme RRV is capable of inducing diseases in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected RM that display similarity to those observed in humans coinfected with HIV and HHV-8. RRV naturally infects B cells in vivo, where the virus is capable of establishing latency (46) expression of vCD200 does not appear to have observable effects on disease development in RRV-infected animals. rhesus fibroblasts were grown in primary rhesus fibroblasts and were purified and concentrated by centrifugation through a 30% sorbitol cushion. a clone of a strain SW105 containing the RRV17577 BAC was induced to express recombination genes and then electroporated with a DNA fragment containing the galK expression cassette. the primers used to generate this cassette include 40 nucleotides (nt of RRV genomic sequence directly flanking either the 5\u2032 end of the R15 start codon (nt 122826 to nt 122865) or the 3\u2032 end of a repair cassette containing the complete R15-ORF74 region with stop codons in all three reading frames of the 5\u2032 coding region of R15 was generated by standard PCR-based mutagenesis with overlapping primer sets. this product also possesses a hemagglutininin (HA) epitope tag coding sequence at the C terminus and is flanked by 200 bp of RRV genomic sequence. the primers used to insert the HA epitope tag at the C terminus of the ORF74 coding region contain the HA coding sequence directly before the TGA stop codon. the primers used to amplify the entire R15-ORF74 region with flanking sequence bind 200 bp upstream of R15 and 200 bp downstream of ORF74. they also contain engineered restriction sites for cloning purposes. one single-base difference upstream of R15 (nt 122737, A to G) and two single-base differences in the intergenic region between R15 and ORF74 (nt 123759, C to T; nt 123810, A to G). to generate a BAC clone containing stop codons in the R15 sequence, the mutated repair cassette was isolated from pSP73 by digestion with XhoI and EcoRI, gel purified. plasmid expressing CRE recombinase allows removal of BAC cassette. resulting virus pool was used in plaque assay on primary rhesus fibroblasts. a stock of the virus was grown in primary rhesus fibroblasts and purified twice. eSPF juvenile RM sero-negative for RRV, rhesus cytomegalovirus, SIV, simian retrovirus type D, simian virus 40 (SV40) and herpes B virus were inoculated intravenously with 5 106 PFU of purified BAC-derived RRV. cohort III consisted of animals that received WT BAC (animals 21963 and 26473) or vCD200 NS (animals 27003, 27009, 27011, and 27100) cohort IV was animals that received WT BAC (animals 29119, 27386, 29000, and 25617) or vCD200 NS (animals 26430, 25662, 28902, and 28834) the vMIP probe sequence was 5\u2032-TCATCTGCCGCCACCCGGTTTA-3\u2032. RRV genome copy numbers were normalized to GAPDH copy numbers to determine the relative amount of RRV genome in each sample of DNA. RRV genome copies to GAPDH copies were then calculated. resulting triplicate values were then averaged to determine the overall RRV genome copies/GAPDH copy number ratio for each cell subset. antibodies directed against CD4 and CD8 were used to define monocytes and dendritic cells. PBMC were stained for CD200R expression by using an anti-human CD200R antibody that cross-reacts with RM CD200R. gating for each sample adjusted above background staining levels using an isotype-matched control antibody (IgG1; BioLegend) cells stained for CD200R were simultaneously stained with surface antibodies to determine the percentage of each cell type within PBMC expressing the receptor. immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and immunofluorescence. tissue sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin to define tissue architecture. in situ hybridization was performed with biotinylated RRV cosmid DNA. cDNA clone was found to encode a protein with 98% amino acid identity to the predicted RM CD200R1 protein. CHO cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1(-) expressing RM CD200R, or empty vector as a control, by using TransIT-LT1 transfection reagent (Mirus Bio, Madison, WI) human IgG Fc control protein was obtained from EMD Millipore (Billerica, MA) samples were analyzed by flow cytometry by using a FITC conjugation kit. unpaired t tests were performed with Prism software (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA) primers used to generate this cassette include 40 nucleotides (nt) of RRV genomic sequence directly flanking either the 5\u2032 end of the R15 start codon (nt 122826 to nt 122865) or the 3\u2032 end of the ORF74 stop codon (nt 124992 to nt 124953), linked to sequence specific for amplification of the galK cassette. DNA was purified from BAC clones by standard alkaline lysis methods a repair cassette containing the complete R15-ORF74 region with stop codons in all three reading frames of the 5\u2032 coding region of R15 was generated by standard PCR-based mutagenesis with overlapping primer sets. the primers used to amplify the 5\u2032 region contained engineered base changes from nt 122866 to nt 122867 (AT to TA) that result in replacement of the R15 start codon with a TAG stop codon (TA mutated repair cassette contains engineered stop mutations in the R15 sequence and the HA epitope tag sequence at the 3\u2032 end of ORF74. a single silent mutation at nt 31 of R15 (T to C), one single-base difference upstream of R15 (nt 122737, A to G), and two single-base differences in the intergenic region. mutated repair cassette was isolated from pSP73 by digestion with XhoI and EcoRI, gel purified, and electroporate competent SW105 E. coli containing the R15-ORF74 galK KO RRV BAC. an RRV BAC clone with the galK cassette replaced by the mutated repair cassette was then identified and DNA was purified. this clone was denoted vCD200 nonsense (vCD200 multiple plaque isolates were picked and grown in primary rhesus fibroblasts. a stock of the virus was grown in primary rhesus fibroblasts and purified twice. the purified BAC-derived mutant virus was denoted vCD200 nonsense (vCD200 NS) RRV. eSPF juvenile RM sero-negative for RRV, rhesus cytomegalovirus, SIV, simian retrovirus type D, simian virus 40 (SV40) and herpes B virus were inoculated intravenously with 5 106 PFU of purified BAC-derived RRV. four separate cohorts of animals were infected during the course of this study. whole blood (WB) and bronchoalveolar lavage samples were collected from all animals at time points prior to and the day of infection (day 0) total cells were isolated from BAL fluid samples by centrifugation followed by resuspension in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS, glutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin (Pen/Strep) total cells were collected and lysed with TRI reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) to isolate DNA. RRV genome copy numbers were normalized to GAPDH copy numbers to determine the relative amount of RRV genome in each sample of DNA. levels of infectious virus in PBMC from infected RM were also assessed by coculture analysis. PBMC and BAL cells were stained with surface antibodies against CD20 (BioLegend, San Diego, CA), IgD (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL) and CD27 (BioLegend) to delineate total, naive, marginal zone-like (MZ-like) and memory B cells. antibodies directed against CD14 (Biolegend) and HLA-DR (Biolegend) were used to define monocytes and dendritic cells. PBMC were stained for CD200R expression by using an anti-human CD200R antibody that cross-reacts with RM CD200R. gating for each sample adjusted above background staining levels using an isotype-matched control antibody (IgG1; BioLegend) cells stained for CD200R were simultaneously stained with surface antibodies to determine the percentage of each cell type within PBMC expressing the receptor. tissue sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin to define tissue architecture. in situ hybridization was performed with biotinylated RRV cosmid DNA. images were acquired using a Zeiss Axioscope 2 Plus microscope. cDNA clone was found to encode a protein with 98% amino acid identity to the predicted RM CD200R1 protein. CHO cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1(-) expressing RM CD200R, or empty vector as a control, by using TransIT-LT1 transfection reagent (Mirus Bio, Madison, WI) vCD200 nonsense mutant RRV was transcribed during RRV infection as the first ORF of a spliced bicistronic message with the downstream ORF74 that encodes the viral GPCR (43) the complete R15-ORF74 region was initially deleted from the RRV genome and replaced with a galK cassette, resulting in the isolation of an R15-ORF74 galK KO BAC clone that served as a target for insertion PCR and direct sequencing across the R15-ORF74 region also confirmed the correct insertion of the mutated R15-ORF74 cassette. a single BAC clone identified in this fashion was picked, and purified BAC DNA from this clone was transfected into primary RF to produce infectious virus. the resulting vCD200 NS virus was then removed from the genome by passage of the virus through RF transfected with a plasmid expressing C viral genome, viral DNA purified from this isolate for analysis. no other mutations were present in the remainder of the viral genome. this analysis revealed that aside from the anticipated nucleotide changes resulting from insertion of the R15-ORF74 repair cassette, no other mutations were present in the remainder of the viral genome. single-step growth curve analysis of vCD200 NS virus in primary rhesus fibroblasts. cells were infected at an MOI of 2.5, and samples were harvested at the indicated time points for plaque assay analysis on primary rhesus fibroblasts. vCD200 protein was detected in RF infected with vCD200 NS. lysates were collected and analyzed for the presence of vCD200 protein. four separate cohorts of RM were inoculated with either vCD200 NS or WT BAC (11 animals) RRV infection of RM can promote the development of HHV-8-like malignancies, including a lymphoproliferative disorder similar to MCD in humans, lymphoma, and less frequently RF. the time required for manifestation of these diseases can be lengthy and is quite variable, with the overall frequency of development being approximately 20 to 30%. at least two animals infected with either of the viruses developing possible lymphoma by the end of the study period. staining of a pancreatic tissue mass demonstrated the development of a virus-associated B cell LPD in an RM infected with vCD200 NS. IgG isotype control antibodies for vIL-6 and CD20. vCD200 NS-infected animals were analyzed by flow cytometry. vCD200 NS-infected animals were analyzed by flow cytometry to determine the total number of CD20+ B cells in infected animals. RRV vCD200 affects viral loads in vivo. a relatively rapid increase in viral DNA loads was detected by 21 to 28 dpi in most animals. highest individual viral loads were also detected in vCD200 NS-infected animals 27011 and 27100. loads compared to vCD200 NS-infected animals suggest vCD200 expression has inhibitory effects on RRV replication levels in vivo. DNA was purified from whole blood collected from each animal at the indicated time points postinfection. individual animal numbers are indicated, and horizontal lines represent average values for each time point. the ratio of RRV genome copy number to GAPDH copy number was calculated for each sample. the average of triplicate values for each cell type is reported for each animal at each time point. vCD200 NS-infected animals possessed a higher average viral load than WT BAC-infected animals. vCD200 expression in vivo results in lower viral loads in RRV-infected animals during acute infection. isolated PBMC were subjected to sequential sorting using NHP-specific magnetic beads. resulting samples were evenly split into triplicates, DNA was isolated from each, and real-time PCR was performed. supernatants of representative coculture samples that developed cytopathic effect (CPE) were screened for the presence of input virus via PCR spanning the R15-ORF74 region followed by direct sequencing of the resulting PCR products. these findings confirmed that the virus isolated from individual animals correspond to the respective input virus used for the initial inoculations. the expression of vCD200 molecules during in vivo infection has been hypothesized to have immunosuppressive effects that can diminish immune responses this analysis allows for a general measure of B and T cell proliferative responses that occur in infected animals due to RRV infection. no differences were noted between virus infection groups in regard to B cell proliferation patterns at any time point or in any subset. changes in Ki67 levels in T cells from PBMC were also variable overall in all subsets examined, with a general elevation in the number of proliferating cells occurring from 7 to 14 dpi. vCD200 expression inhibits CD4 and CD8 T cell proliferation early after RRV infection. this effect is eventually overcome as the infection progresses. in PBMC samples, the overall levels of responses detected for all T cell subsets examined were low. RRV-specific CD8 and CD4 T cell responses were detectable in BAL samples from all infected animals. vCD200 NS-infected animals possessed a higher percentage of responding total CD8 cells at 7 dpi (P = 0.0337) and in EM CD8 cells at 7 and 14 dpi (P = 0.0372 and P = 0.0134, respectively) vCD200 is capable of inhibiting the development of T cell responses induced by RRV infection in vivo. responses in animals infected with vCD200 NS were only apparent at early times postinfection (7 and 14 dpi) by 21 dpi the average responses for vCD200 NS-infected and WT BAC-infected animals were similar. significant differences in average responses were detected at 7 dpi in total CD8. the percentages of RRV-specific total (A), effector memory (B) and central memory (C) RRV-specific CD4 T cells in BAL samples were determined by performing ICCS as described in the legend for Fig. 6. the putative expression profile of CD200R has widened. it has also been reported to be detectable on several other cell types. despite this information, the CD200R expression pattern in RM has not yet been fully examined. PBMCs purified from preinfection whole blood samples were stained with surface antibodies to delineate CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD20+ B cells, DCs, and monocytes. CHO cells were transfected with a vector expressing full-length RM CD200R or with empty vector as a control, incubated for 48 h. RRV vCD200 has previously been shown to regulate cells expressing CD200R in vitro. cDNA expressing full-length RM CD200R was isolated from RNA derived from RM PBMC and cloned into an expression vector. CHO cells were transfected with the RM CD200R expression vector, or empty vector as a control, and then cells were stained with antibody directed against CD200R to confirm expression of the receptor. in monocytes, slight fluctuations in receptor levels occurred from 0 to 28 dpi in all animals. levels then rapidly declining back to baseline levels by 42 dpi. despite slight variability in preinfection CD200R levels between animals, in DCs there was a noticeable steady decline in CD200R levels from 0 dpi to 28 dpi. decrease at 14 dpi, and alternating in this manner through approximately 42 dpi. all animals showed a slow elevation in CD200R levels from 0 to14 dpi. the pattern of CD200R expression levels in B cells seems to partly parallel the change in total B cell levels observed in infected animals. vCD200 nonsense mutant RRV was mutated to a stop codon (TGA) in the cassette. a single base mutation was also made in the third reading frame of R15 to introduce a stop codon (TAC to TAA), while the second reading frame contained a naturally occurring stop codon (TAC to TAA) the ORF74 sequence was engineered to encode an HA epitope tag at the C terminus of the vGPCR for detection purposes. the resulting PCR product was cloned and sequenced, and the repair cassette was then isolated by restriction digestion and Southern blot analysis. after recombination in E. coli, galK-negative BAC clones were identified, and BAC DNA was isolated and screened for the presence of the mutated R15-ORF the remainder of the viral genome is directly compared to the genomic sequence of vCD200 NS BAC-derived RRV. the removal of R15-ORF74 was accomplished by targeting this region for deletion with a positive selection step with a galK cassette containing 40 bp of genomic flanking sequence from either side of the respective ORFs. the location of the BAC cassette within the RRV BAC is indicated and loxP sites are denoted by asterisks. cells were infected at an MOI of 2.5, and samples were harvested at the indicated time points for plaque assay analysis on primary rhesus fibroblasts. immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis of vCD200 expression in rhesus fibroblasts. four separate cohorts of RM were inoculated with either vCD200 NS (12 animals) or WT BAC (11 animals) in an attempt to assess the potential effects of vCD200 expression on RRV-associated disease development in the context of SIV infection. animals in cohorts III and IV were infected only with BAC-derived RRV. culation Secondary inoculation I 25631 M SIV WT BAC 25650 M SIV vCD200 NS 26001 M SIV vCD200 NS II 24807 M WT BAC SIV 24896 M WT BAC SIV 25639 M vCD200 NS SIV 25645 M vCD200 NS SIV III 21963 F WT BAC None 26473 M WT BAC None 27003 M vCD200 the viruses developing possible lymphoma by the end of the study period. staining of a pancreatic tissue mass demonstrated the development of a virus-associated B cell LPD in an RM infected with vCD200 NS. another hallmark of RRV infection in RM is the development of B cell hyperplasia. analysis of total CD20+ B cell numbers in PBMC from immunocompetent animals (cohorts II to IV) showed that both viruses are equally capable of inducing B cell hyperplasia in infected RM. despite animal-to-animal variation, the general pattern of B cell hyperplasia observed in all RRV-infected animals began with a gradual increase in total CD20+ B cells from 7 to 28 days postinfection. real-time PCR analysis was performed using DNA isolated from RM samples. a relatively rapid increase in viral DNA loads was detected by 21 to 28 dpi in most animals. peak viral loads occurred sooner overall, with 8 of 10 (80%) vCD200 NS-infected animals showing peak viral loads at 21 dpi. DNA was purified from whole blood collected from each animal at the indicated time points postinfection. 100 ng of each DNA sample was used to measure viral genome copies via real-time PCR analysis. horizontal lines represent average values for each time point. vCD200 NS-infected and WT BAC-infected animals possessed a higher average viral load than WT BAC-infected animals at this same time point. vCD200 NS-infected animals possessed a higher average viral load than WT BAC-infected animals at this same time point. in vivo results in lower viral loads in RRV-infected animals during acute infection. isolated PBMC were subjected to sequential sorting using NHP-specific magnetic beads. resulting samples were evenly split into triplicates, DNA was isolated from each, and real-time PCR was performed. supernatants of representative coculture samples that developed cytopathic effect (CPE) were screened for the presence of input virus via PCR spanning the R15-ORF74 region followed by direct sequencing of the resulting PCR products. these findings confirmed that the virus isolated from individual animals corresponded to the respective input virus used for the initial inoculations. vCD200 NS virus maintained the mutated R15 sequence during in vivo infection. changes in Ki67 levels in T cells from PBMC were also variable overall in all subsets examined. a general elevation in the number of proliferating cells occurring from 7 to 14 dpi and fluctuations thereafter until 49 to 56 dpi. a defined peak of elevated proliferation was observed at 7 dpi in CM and EM subsets of both CD4 and CD8 T cells in BAL from vCD200-infected animals. a significant difference in average proliferation levels was detected at 7 dpi between vCD200 NS-infected animals in EM CD4 T cells. a major question we also wished to address was whether or not vCD200 affects the development of RRV-specific T cell responses in infected RM. RRV-specific CD8 and CD4 T cell responses were detectable in vCD200 NS-infected animals at 7 and 14 dpi. vCD200 NS-infected animals possessed a higher percentage of responding total CD8 cells at both 7 and 14 dpi. differences in responses between viruses were not as well defined. vCD200 is capable of inhibiting the development of T cell responses induced by RRV infection in vivo. responses in animals infected with vCD200 NS eventually becoming comparable to those in WT BAC-infected animals by 21 dpi. this suggests that the regulatory effects of RRV vCD200 on the development of T cell responses are functional mainly early during in vivo infection. the percentages of RRV-specific total (A), effector memory (B) and central memory (C) RRV-specific CD4 T cells in BAL samples were determined by performing ICCS as described in the legend for Fig. 6. RRV-specific antibody responses in animals from cohorts II to IV were also measured. despite this information, the CD200R expression pattern in RM has not yet been fully examined. analyses were undertaken to assess the location of the receptor in RM PBMC. to identify the location of CD200R, PBMC were isolated from preinfection samples of all animals. PBMCs purified from preinfection whole blood samples (day 7 and day 0) obtained from animals in cohorts II, III, and IV were stained with surface antibodies to delineate CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD20+ B cells, DCs, and monocytes. the average level of staining observed for each subset is noted by a horizontal line. cDNA expressing full-length RM CD200R was isolated from RNA derived from RM PBMC. cells were stained with antibody directed against CD200R to confirm expression of the receptor. cells were also incubated with FITC-labeled vCD200-Fc protein to assess the ability of RRV vCD200 to directly bind RM CD200R expressed on the cell surface. despite slight variability in preinfection CD200R levels between animals, there was a noticeable steady decline in CD200R levels from 0 dpi to 28 dpi. the changes in CD200R levels in DCs appeared to be inversely proportional to viral loads through 35 dpi. RRV infection results in a repression of CD200R expression in DCs early during infection. a slow elevation in CD200R levels from 0 to14 dpi followed by a slight decrease at 21 dpi and a second and more robust increase to peak levels for most animals at 35 dpi. the pattern of CD200R expression levels in B cells seems to partly parallel the change in total B cell levels observed in infected animals. it is possible that the observed increase in CD200R levels seen on B cells is due to the preferential expansion of CD200R+ CD20+ the importance of CD200 to immunity has been demonstrated by its central involvement in regulating responses during microbial infections (52) several viruses of the Poxviridae, Adenoviridae, and Herpesviridae families have been shown to encode functional homologues of this molecule (7, 28\u201330, 35) these vCD200 proteins are generally thought to be beneficial to viral survival within the host. T BAC and vCD200 NS indicated no differences in disease manifestations between viruses. RM infected with vCD200 NS possessed higher viral loads than RM infected with WT BAC. RM infected with vCD200 NS possessed higher viral loads than RM infected with WT BAC. RRV-specific responses were most pronounced in CD8 T cells. despite the apparent effects of vCD200 on T cell responses, no difference in RRV-specific antibody responses was detected between animals infected with either vCD200 NS or vCD200 NS. the most notable changes in CD200R levels occurred in monocytes, monocytes, and B cells. DCs showed a steady decline in CD200R levels immediately following RRV infection, followed by a rapid spike at 35 dpi, before returning to near preinfection levels. monocytes also showed a sharp increase in CD200R levels at 35 dpi. vCD200 may exert inhibitory properties on DCs at later stages of infection. however, a variety of mechanisms are involved in determining exactly how RRV vCD200 actually inhibits the activation of T cells in vivo. this may be true with regard to understanding the effects of CD200/CD200 on disease development. a viral interferon regulatory factor (vIRF) deletion clone of RRV (49) showed higher average viral loads than those infected with vCD200 NS. vCD200-induced signaling became less effective as viral loads become elevated above a certain threshold level in infected animals. it is likely that development of an inflammatory environment could promote RRV replication in vivo, and as such, inhibition of immune responses by vCD200 early after infection may have the RRV and other gammaherpesviruses were involved in disrupting or altering normal CD200/CD200R interactions. sCD200 appears to be highly abundant in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients and has been suggested to be important for CLL engraftment."}
