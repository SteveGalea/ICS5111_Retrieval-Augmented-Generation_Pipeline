{"summary": "epidemiologic transition theory is infrequently employed in epidemiology. but epidemiologic transition theory is infrequently employed in epidemiology. we discuss critiques and modifications of the theory of epidemiologic transition theory. the increase in CIDs is concomitant with a decrease in epidemic infections that occurred during the second epidemiologic transition (34) many epidemiologists have noticed that the increase in CIDs is concomitant with a decrease in epidemic infections that occurred during the second transition (34) the phenomenon has been attributed to the diminished exposure to environmental microorganisms and to decline in the mass and diversity of gut microbiota. researchers have identified causal relationships between lifestyle changes, infectious burden, and the incidence of allergic and autoimmune diseases. they continue to investigate these dynamics using animal models of autoimmune and allergic diseases and clinical intervention studies. this action reflects increasing public health awareness that interfering with long-standing balance between humans and nonpathogenic microbes in their environments can have pervasive and substantial health effects. this action reflects increasing public health awareness that interfering with long-standing balance between humans and nonpathogenic microbes in their environments can have pervasive and substantial health effects. human settlements have consolidated to the point that the majority of the global population now lives in urban environments with ample opportunities for ongoing disease transmission. globalization has linked the health problems of impoverished communities with other populations throughout the globe, in developed nations and LMICs. researchers can extend lessons from the intensification of agriculture to preventing, or at least reducing, the evolution of drug resistant infections. the FDA announced in December 2013 that it was phasing out the use of antibiotics as growth promoters in cows, pigs, and chickens."}
