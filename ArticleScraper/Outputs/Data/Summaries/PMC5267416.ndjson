{"summary": "the present study examined patterns and predictors for EOL care intensity among elderly patients with chronic kidney disease. the primary outcomes were inpatient expenses and use of surgical interventions in the last 30 days of life. the average inpatients costs for elderly CKD patients were approximately US$10,260. intensive service use among older patients with CKD was high, with significant variability across various patient and provider characteristics. several opportunities exist for providers and policy makers to reduce costs and enhance the value of EOL care for this population."}
