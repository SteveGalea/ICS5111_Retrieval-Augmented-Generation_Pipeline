{"summary": "monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) represent the most important class of biologics and have great potential for both diagnostic and therapeutic applications. fully human mAbs can be derived from human B cells by immortalization via viral transformation,2 through the generation of human hybridomas. antibody therapeutics should not aggregate or precipitate and resist degradation by proteases, as these factors contribute to optimal manufacturing and shelf life properties. similar stability requirements also apply for diagnostic and research mAb tools. the 400 VH/VL pairings resulting from the combination of those 40 variable domains were characterized in vitro to rank VH/VL framework pairs according to properties. at the end of this testing, 36 fixed and distinct VH/VL framework pairs were selected as variable region scaffolds for Ylanthia. diversity was introduced to remove potential post-translational modification sites (PTMs) the CDR3 cassettes were based on the Ig gene segment- (CDR-L3) and on the CDR length (CDR-H3) to mimic the natural position-dependent occurrence of amino acids in the CDR3s. the results show that the 36 VH/VL pairs that compose Ylanthia translate into highly diverse sets of target-specific and high affinity antibodies with favorable biophysical characteristics. V2\u201314 was the most frequently found V gene segment (18.1%), followed by V1\u201340 (11.3%), V1\u201344 (11.3%) and V1\u201351 (10.0%) the most prevalent natural VH/VL pairs were composed of the most frequently occurring VH and VL gene segments. the most prevalent natural VH/VL pairs were composed of the most frequently occurring VH and VL gene segments. circles and frames show the final selected 21 VH/V pairs that are included in Ylanthia. circles indicate VH/V pairs that were not found in our analysis of natural VH/VL pair sequences. prominent VH, V and V sequences were excluded for this in silico analysis. the prominent V and V gene segments, V4\u20131, V2\u201328/2D-28, V1\u201333/1D-33, V1\u20138, V2D\u201329 and V1\u201344 were excluded. 6 5 H1\u20131 17 H2\u20133 4 1 VH3\u201311 2.6 17 9.0 5 H1\u20131 17 H2\u20133 3 1 VH3\u201315 3.3 11 9.0 5 H1\u20131 19 H2\u20133 3 1 VH3\u201315 3.3 11 9.0 5 H1\u20131 19 H2\u20133 3 1 VH3\u201315 3.3 11 9.0 5 H1\u20131 19 H2\u20134 4 1 VH3\u201321 3.3 12 9.0 5 H 11 L1\u20132 7 L2\u20131 0 VK1\u201327 2.2 12 8.7 11 L1\u20132 7 L2\u20131 0 VK1\u201339 14.2 2 8.0 11 L1\u20132 7 L2\u20131 0 VK2\u201330 2.6 9 8.0 16 L1\u20134 7 L2\u20131 2 VK3\u201311 7.6 6 6.3 11 L1\u20132 7 L2\u20131 0 VK3\u201315 11.1 4 8.0 11 L1\u2013 the selected V gene segments showed the lowest pI values ranging from 4.5 (V3\u20131) to 6.7 (V2\u201311, V2\u201323) the majority of the analyzed germline VH gene segments included potential PTM sites. the majority of the analyzed germline VH gene segments included potential PTM sites. 20 VH, 12 V and 8 V gene segments were combined to generate VH/VL pairs for experimental analysis. 400 VH/VL pairs represent the most prominent VH/VL pairs in the human antibody repertoire. all VH regions carried the same CDR-H3 derived from the VH region of the hu4D5\u20138 antibody. Fabs with a V framework showed a lower median relative expression than V bearing Fab fragments (median 0.47 vs. 0.78, p 0.0001, Mann-Whitney U-test) in the bacterial cell lysate screening. ELISA determined the median with interquartile range. no significant difference between the median IgG1 expression levels of VH/V and VH/V frameworks was observed. no universal correlation between bacterial Fab and mammalian IgG1 expression levels was observed. low Fab display and expression were also observed for VH1\u20132, VH4\u201331, VH4\u201339 and VH5\u201351 containing VH/VL pairs. no significant difference in relative Fab display rates was detected between VH/V and VH/V pairs. the majority of VH/VL combinations comprising V1\u201317 and V2\u201330 are not stable at temperatures above 60\u00b0C, whereas most VH/VL pairs containing V1\u201327 and V3\u201315 were stable at 70\u00b0C. this screening approach allowed rapid identification of VH/VL pairs sensitive to elevated temperatures. previous screening assays were useful in identifying VH/VL pairs containing instable Ig light chains. research-scale Fab expression yields of 91 VH/VL pairs measured after purification ranged from 1.5\u201313 mg/L with a median yield of 5.0 mg/L. no major difference in Fab expression yields was observed between the selected V and V bearing VH/VL pairs. melting temperatures of purified Fab and human IgG1 molecules are determined by DSF measurements. in each panel the median with interquartile range is indicated. the monomeric portions of purified Fab and human IgG1 molecules ranged between 88% and 100%. the human IgG1 Fc domain shows a transition between 68.4 and 70.6\u00b0C. in cases with only one transition, the Tm of the Fab portion coincides with the melting temperature of the Fc part. in cases with only one transition, the Tm of the Fab portion coincides with the melting temperature of the Fc part. seven VH/VL pairs (VH3\u201315/V1\u201309, VH1\u201346/V3\u20131, VH1\u201346/V3\u201321, VH1\u201369/V1\u201340, VH1\u201369/V3\u20131, VH3\u201321/V3\u20131, VH3\u201330/V3\u20131) showed a radius between 7 and 14 nm and two framework pairings (VH6\u20131/V1\u201347 and VH6\u20131/ VH/VL pairs UV-spectrometry measurements at 320 nm were performed to determine the turbidity of IgG1 samples before and at different time points (10 min and 100 min) after acidification and subsequent neutralization. all other tested VH/VL pairs showed no or only a moderate increase in turbidity upon low pH treatment, indicating a relative resistance toward aggregate formation.

VH1\u20132 and VH3\u201373 containing Fabs yielded consistently the lowest relative expression. Fabs with a V framework showed a lower median relative expression than V bearing Fab fragments in the bacterial cell lysate screening. all VH1\u20132 and VH3\u201323 containing IgG1s showed reduced expression levels compared with the reference antibody. no significant difference between the median IgG1 expression levels of VH/V and VH/V frameworks. only VH3 vs. VH1, VH3 vs. VH4, VH3 vs. VH5 and VH3 vs. VH6 gave significant differences, p 0.05, one-way analysis of variance, Bonferroni\u2019s multiple comparison test. between VH/V and VH/V pairs, no significant difference in relative Fab display rates was detected. denatured, aggregated or degraded Fab molecules were expected to show reduced signals. of the 285 tested Fab VH/VL pairs, 215 (75%) showed a Tm of at least 60\u00b0C. majority of VH/VL combinations comprising V1\u201317 and V2\u201330 are not stable at temperatures above 60\u00b0C, whereas most VH/VL pairs containing V1\u201327 and V3\u201315 were stable at 70\u00b0C. synthetic antibody gene sequences within Ylanthia were codon-optimized27 for both E. coli (Fab) and mammalian expression (human IgG1) to obtain high Fab and IgG1 expression levels necessary for high-throughput screening platforms. no major difference in Fab expression yields was observed between the selected V and V bearing VH/VL pairs. purified Fab (left panel) and human IgG1 (right panel) molecules were purified as determined by UV-spectrophotometry. monomer content of purified Fab (left panel) and human IgG1 (right panel) molecules was determined by SEC. a median with interquartile range is indicated. the human IgG1 Fc domain shows a transition between 68.4 and 70.6\u00b0C. in cases with only one transition, the Tm of the Fab portion coincides with the melting temperature of the Fc part. antibodies, the hydrodynamic radius and polydispersity were evaluated for each sample by dynamic light scattering (DLS) out of 89 tested IgG1 VH/VL framework pairs, 80 VH/VL combinations showed a hydrodynamic radius below or equal to 6 nm and were therefore considered to exist as monomeric IgG1. the morphology of visible and sub-visible aggregates in solution was further assessed by a semi-quantitative particle staining assay. the morphology of visible and sub-visible aggregates in solution was further assessed by a semi-quantitative particle staining assay.

KD values ranged between 700 pM and 190 nM with kon rates between 2.9E+04 M1s1 and 4.6E+06 M1s1 and koff rates between 8.1E-05 sec1 and 1.7E-01 sec1. 233 (89.6%) showed a monomer content equal to or higher than 90%. 196 (75.7%) had a monomer portion greater than 95%. median Tm value of all V IgG1 antibodies was significantly higher compared with the V bearing IgG1s. Ylanthia, a fully synthetic human Fab antibody phage display library, was built on 36 fixed germline VH/VL framework pairs selected for their favorable biophysical properties. the resulting 400 VH/VL pairs were screened to assess display and expression properties both as Fab and IgG1. characterization of expression and other biophysical characteristics in both Fab and IgG1 formats. we selected assays for further characterization of our framework VH/VL pairs to simulate those stress conditions and select for properties that ensure optimal performance. previous work that failed to reveal any evidence for preferences in natural pairing of particular VH and VL gene families has shown that the human VH1 family shows a strong pairing preference with the V3 family. this suggests that the human VH1 family shows a strong pairing preference with the V3 family. Ylanthia allowed for complete control of both nucleotide and amino acid content and distribution. the use of VH sequences devoid of PTMs in their CDR-H1 and CDR-H2 make the subsequent removal of such motifs unnecessary. however, they harbor the risk of being potentially immunogenic in humans. DR-H3 sequences were designed to obtain pI values ranging from 7.5 to 9 for the full-length antibody. this should maximize solubility of the protein in the neutral or slightly acidic formulation buffers routinely used. for antibodies with pI values greater than 9 rapid clearance from the blood and decreased half-life in vivo65,66 have been described. more than 300 IgGs against recombinant proteins have been identified in various pilot experiments with Ylanthia. a large amount of data has already been acquired to assess the expression characteristics and biophysical properties of antibodies derived from Ylanthia. the Ylanthia library is based on a novel concept that incorporates desirable antibody characteristics in its design through selection of optimal framework pairs. it represents a new platform that generates fully human antibody candidates with optimized biophysical properties. synthesized Ig V region heavy chain genes covered the sequences from the first unique 5\u2032 restriction site for NdeI located in the modified phoA leader sequence to the 3\u2032 restriction sites for XhoI and SalI located at the V to C region border. upstream from the CDR-L3, a restriction site for BbsI was incorporated to enable subsequent CDR-L3 library insertion. each transformed pYPdis10 and pJPx1_FH pool was plated on LB/Cam/Gluc plates. clones were sequenced with Y_Fab_VH_for (5\u2032-GATAAGCATGCGTAGGAGAAA-3\u2032), Y_Fab_dis_VL_for (5\u2032-TGTTGCCACCTTTATGTATG-3\u2032) and Y_Fab_Bex_VL_for (5\u2032-TGGA /VL pairs cloned in display vector pYPdis10 were inoculated in 2 YT/Cam/1%Gluc and incubated while shaking at 400 rpm until an OD600 nm of 0.5 was reached. the cells were then infected with Hyperphage (PROGEN), centrifuged and re-suspended in 2 YT medium with 34 g/ml chloramphenicol, 50 g/ E. coli cells were lysed by adding 2 BBS/EDTA/lysozyme buffer (24.7 mg/ml boric acid, 18.7 mg/ml NaCl, 1.48 mg/ml EDTA, 2.5 mg/ml lysozyme, adjusted to pH 8.0 with 10 M NaOH) subsequently blocked with 12.5% milk powder, 0.05% Tween\u00ae in PBS.
