{"summary": "a paper seeks to examine the inclusion of migrants in the UHC systems of five ASEAN countries. it seeks to examine current migration trends and policies as well as ongoing UHC developments. all five countries, whether receiving or sending, have schemes that cover migrants to varying extent. Thailand's government spends comparatively more as a percentage of total health expenditure (75.5%) than Malaysia (55.2%) and Singapore (31%) all three countries have either claimed or been reported to have achieved UHC according to their respective definitions. CMHI enrolls migrant workers upon conduct of pre-employment health screening. health benefits, including outpatient and inpatient care, are linked to the hospital where the migrant was registered and screened (51) there are however limitations to the CHMI. hospitals often require at least one official document to purchase insurance. a temporary legitimate residence permit (also known as Tor Ror 38/1), a passport or, for undocumented migrants without these identity documents, an approved document from the employer such as their house registration (55). a general unease among some providers about selling the card to undocumented migrants \u2013 who themselves may not feel confident to approach the hospital and purchase the card (55). the minimum liability of employers is MYR 300 (USD 84) for surgical ward treatment and MYR 250 (USD 70) for operation charges. the maximum compensation amounts to only MYR 23,000 (USD 6,388) in the case of permanent disablement. migrant workers need to produce their private insurance card at the hospital registration counter, omitting the need for upfront cash payments (58). public sector technically cannot refuse emergency care to those who cannot pay via prepaid insurance or OPPs, including irregular migrants. employers are required to purchase a minimum private medical insurance coverage of SGD 15,000 (USD 11,193) per year for inpatient care and surgery. the amount for medical expenses compensation has been capped at SGD 30,000 (USD 22,386) (67), which can also be easily breached due to high cost of services. the current administration's UHC program has reported 79% population coverage. the poorest 9.6 million families are already being subsidized by the national and local government (71) in 2013, the NHIA was amended (72) to pave the way for massive reforms in benefit design and provider-payment mechanisms. those who were not able to enroll in PhilHealth prior to departure may register via the website or its collecting partners in selected countries. despite the Philippines being a predominantly sending country, PhilHealth also allows foreign nationals residing or working in the Philippines to enroll in PhilHealth as individually-paying or employed members. the government-financed health insurance program for the poor and near poor covers only 40% of its 240 million population. askes and jamsostek are also social security schemes that include employment injury, retirement, and death benefits (78). despite the existence of such protective policies, implementation gaps remain. number of claims unprocessed by insurance companies and ill-defined coverage and excluded conditions (83, 84) foreigners in Indonesia are reluctant to join in the young scheme."}
