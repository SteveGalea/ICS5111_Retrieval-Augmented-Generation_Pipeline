{"summary": "the study cultivated cell lines from goats, sheep, cattle, camelids, rodents, insectivores, bats, and human and nonhuman primates. cells were checked to ensure the absence of mycoplasma contamination. all cells expressed DPP-4, as determined by immunofluorescence staining. species of origin was confirmed by sequencing of the cytochrome c subunit oxidase I gene. parents and the calf phenotypically resembled C. bactrianus. coronavirus receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4; rabbit anti-CD26/DPP-4 polyclonal antibody; bioss Inc., Woburn, MA, USA) in cell lines used to guide the search for the intermediate host of the virus. cell lines of human, bat, and primate origin were used as controls. we quantified virus replication by using the upE assay (14), a MERS-CoV real-time reverse transcription PCR that screens upstream of the E gene. replication was seen in lung and kidney cell lines derived from goats (Capra hircus) and in umbilical cord and kidney cells from camelids. MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies have been detected in camels. the virus has not previously been detected in camels (8,9). an informed focusing of investigations on a select group of species, such as camels, could benefit epidemiologic investigations. ungulates, such as goats and camels, are a possible intermediate host of MERS-CoV. exposure to urine and feces from these animals might constitute a source of human infection."}
