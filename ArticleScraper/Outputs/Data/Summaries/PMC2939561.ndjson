{"summary": "TGEV is a type of single-stranded RNA virus, which produces villous atrophy and enteritis, leading to the serious financial loss to the whole pig industry. traditional detection methods include virus isolation, virus immunodiagnostic assays and PCR tests. the traditional detection methods have the shortcomings, such as precise instruments requirement, elaborate result analysis demand, high cost, long detection time and so forth. RNA/DNA samples were stored at -70\u00b0C before use. original concentration of RNA/DNA sample was about 50 ng/L. target region and LAMP primers designing Complete genome sequences of fifteen different TGEV strains/isolates. the amplification was performed at 60\u00b0C in a laboratory water bath. the amplified products were digested with HphI to confirm its specificity. the result of TGEV-LAMP was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and fluorescence by adding 1 SYBR greenI in the LAMP reaction. target region and LAMP primers designing Complete genome sequences of 15 different TGEV strains/isolates and nine other similar viruses were obtained from GenBank. the homology was chosen as the target region which and used to design the TGEV LAMP primers by the Primer Explorer V3 software http://primerexplorer.jp/e/. TGEV-LAMP was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and fluorescence by adding 1 SYBR greenI in the LAMP reaction. sensitivity of TGEV-LAMP was examined by the use of RNA (or DNA) extracted from five other pig disease viruses. amplification products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. amplification could be carried out at 60\u00b0C and showed a ladder-like pattern. negative control gave no bands (Lane 3) LAMP and nest-PCR were able to detect 10-5 dilution (about 10 pg RNA), whereas PCR could only amplify the 10-4 dilution. sensitivity of TGEV-LAMP could be comparable to nest-PCR, 10-fold higher than PCR. amplification products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. amplification could be carried out at 60\u00b0C and showed a ladder-like pattern. negative control gave no bands (Lane 3) sensitivity of TGEV-LAMP could be comparable to nest-PCR. sensitivity of TGEV-LAMP could be 10-fold higher than nest-PCR. sensitivity of TGEV-LAMP could be comparable to nest-PCR. real time fluorescence LAMP for quantitatively detection of TGEV was established by adding 1 SYBR greenIin the LAMP reaction. the results showed no amplification in all viruses tested, which makes the LAMP more accurate and reliable for TGEV detection. the LAMP method established could detect only the TGEV and no cross-reaction with other viruses. the detection limit was about 10 pg RNA, which was 10 times more sensitive than that of PCR. authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
