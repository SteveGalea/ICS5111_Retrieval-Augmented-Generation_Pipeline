{"summary": "innate immune system uses germline-encoded receptors named pattern-recognition receptors. PRRs recognize conserved molecular structures of pathogens known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) to initiate immune responses that counteract pathogen infection. the mechanism by which they function as an immune stimulant remained unclear for a long time. cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP)-adenosine monophosphate (AMP) (cGAMP) in the presence of GTP and ATP, which subsequently binds to the adaptor protein STING on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. the dimer undergoes a dramatic trafficking process from the ER to the golgi complex and eventually to perinuclear compartments. cGAS catalyzes the production of cGAMP to bind and activate the ER-resident adaptor protein STING. cGAMP then forms a complex with TBK1 and translocates from the ER to the perinuclear lysosomal compartments via an autophagy-like process. the STING\u2013TBK1 complex subsequently activates transcription factors IRF3 and NF-B. infected cell protein 27; IFN, interferon; IRF3, interferon regulatory factor 3; KSHV, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus; NF-B, nuclear factor-B; NS2B, nonstructural protein 2B; ORF52, open reading frame 52; P, phosphorylation; RLRs, RIG-I-like receptors; STING, stimulator of interferon genes; TBK1, TANK cGAS may play a role in RNA virus-induced cytokine production. the role of STING in RNA virus-mediated type I IFN and cytokine production still awaits further investigation. some studies showed that loss of STING impaired VSV and SeV-induced IFN production. cGAS\u2013STING pathway is the first step of the DNA sensing pathway. tegument protein open reading frame 52 (ORF52) of several gammaherpesviruses was found to interact with cGAS and disrupt its binding to viral DNA, thus inhibiting activation of cGAS\u2013STING pathway. two oncoviruses, human papillomavirus 18 (HPV18) and human adenovirus 5 (hAd5), have been shown to inhibit STING activity using their viral oncoproteins E7 and E1A. the nonstructural protein NS4B of yellow fever virus (YFV) was the first reported viral protein that interacts and inhibits STING. studies of mechanisms employed by STING to restrict RNA virus infection have only just begun. cGAS\u2013STING pathway is required for host responses against both DNA and RNA viruses. cytosolic RNA does not activate cGAS to generate cGAMP. what is the strategy that STING uses to inhibit translation if it is eIF2-independent? Answers to these questions will further expand our understanding of how the cGAS\u2013STING pathway deploys immune defenses to detect and eliminate viral infection."}
