{"summary": "world health organization estimates 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness and up to 500,000 deaths worldwide each year. the virus is enveloped and contains eight single-stranded RNA segments coding for up to 12 proteins (3). it evades the host immune system by undergoing a continuous antigenic evolution through frequent mutations of surface antigens. HAs of pathogenic avian influenza viruses are characterized by multibasic cleavage sites containing RXXR furin-like recognition sequences. HA glycoproteins of nonavian viruses have monobasic cleavage sites more preferentially recognized by extracellular proteases of the host. TTSPs are capable of initiating HA0 cleavage and enabling viral activation. matriptase cleaved hemagglutinins of H1 viruses (23), but only TMPRSS2 has been shown to activate influenza virus in human bronchial epithelial cells. TTSP family currently encompasses 20 members in both humans and mice, divided into four subfamilies. the role of matriptase in proteolytic cleavage/activation of influenza virus HA. we established its expression in normal human lungs and bronchial epithelial cells. we showed its ability to cleave consensus cleavage sequences of known human influenza viruses. cell lines were cultured at 5% CO2 and 37\u00b0C. X-31 and PR8 viruses were amplified in 10-day-old embryonated hens' eggs. pH1N1/2009 was an isolate of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus. serial 10-fold dilutions of samples were prepared in incomplete EMEM. the number of viral plaques was counted to determine viral PFU levels.

Virus was left to adsorb for 1 h, and cells were washed once. cells were then incubated with various concentrations of IN-1 (in water) or compound 21 (in dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO] for 48 h. X-31 and PR8 viruses were amplified in 10-day-old embryonated hens' eggs. pH1N1/2009 (A/California/7/2009-like) was an isolate of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus. cells were washed with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline. MDCK cells were cultured to confluence and infected either with PR8, X31, or pH1N1/2009 virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 2. Viruses were allowed to replicate for 24 h in cells cultured in incomplete medium without TPCK-treated trypsin. matriptase and actin proteins were detected by Western blotting using specific rabbit anti-human matriptase or anti-actin antibodies. PCR primers used for TTSP gene expression analysis. ched fluorescent peptide (IQFP) mimetics were designed to incorporate four amino acids on the P side of the cleavage site. fluorescence and quenching pairs were 3-nitrotyrosine and ortho-aminobenzoic acid (Abz) cells were infected with 25 PFU of PR8 virus for 1 h. cells were then washed once, and medium was replaced with Avicel overlay medium containing 43 nM matriptase or as control 43 nM TPCK-treated trypsin. the number of viral plaques was determined at 48 h postinfection as described above. cells were seeded at 6 105 cells/cm2 onto coverslips. cells were seeded at 24 h postinfection with 1% PFA (30 min) and permeabilized with 0.1% saponin, and coverslips were blocked with 0.25% gelatin. coverslips were incubated with goat anti-matriptase antibody (1:25) and chicken anti-early endosomal antigen 1 (EEA-1) antibody (1:200) coveredlips were incubated with secondary antibodies: goat anti-chicken Alexa Fluor 488, donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594, and donkey anti-sheep Alexa Fluor 647. slides were processed as for the staining of submerged cell culture fluorescence data were plotted using Adobe Photoshop software (Adobe Systems) to determine colocalization of fluorescent pixels, overlap quadrant ranks (thresholds) were placed forming background (C), Alexa Fluor 594-only (D), Alexa Fluor 647-only (A) and colocalization areas (B) s were then incubated with various concentrations of IN-1 (in water) or compound 21 (in dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO]) for 48 h. RNA extracts were obtained from normal human lung (Ambion) and from various human bronchial and alveolar cell lines (Calu-3, NCI-H292, and A 549) and primary human epithelial cell cultures (NHBE cells) very faint bands for HAT were observed in normal human lung and NHBE cells. matriptase is expressed in the normal human lung and human bronchial epithelial cells. gene expression levels of matriptase were determined. fluorescence indicating that matriptase was expressed at and near the plasma membrane of Calu-3 cells. results are representative of at least three independent experiments. we analyzed matriptase protein expression in human bronchial epithelial cells. results from epifluorescence microscopy showed concentrated green fluorescence, indicating that matriptase was expressed at and near the plasma membrane of Calu-3 cells. matriptase had an appropriate localization to cleave influenza virus HA and since matriptase has also been shown to be shed. matriptase was far superior (117.53 9.05 FU min1 nmol1) at cleaving this peptide than peptides containing HA cleavage sites. the catalytic domain of matriptase is capable of cleaving specific influenza virus HA consensus cleavage sequences. octapeptides used to determine the biochemical cleavage capacity of matriptase toward HA consensus cleavage sequences represent only a small portion of the HA protein. we then tested whether matriptase had the capacity to cleave influenza virus HA of the whole virus at physiological pH. matriptase is much less efficient at cleaving influenza virus HA than trypsin. this is consistent with IQFP data presented in Fig. 2. matriptase proteolytically processed PR8 H1 within 2 h. HA0 cleavage assays were performed with trypsin (200 nM) at pH 7.4 for 2 h. HA0 cleavage was analyzed by Western blotting. results represent the means standard errors of the means. matriptase is capable of cleaving influenza virus HA in a broad range of pHs. cleavage activity was assessed with matriptase (500 nM) incubated in Tris buffer at various pH values for 30 min. no viral plaques were observed with the X-31 virus. blotting showed a dose-dependent accumulation of virions with cleaved HA. the results showed that matriptase was able to support multicycle replication of both viruses in a dose-dependent manner. trypsin allowed the activation of a maximum number of viruses at the cell surface. addition of matriptase at an equivalent molar concentration resulted in only 2.5% of the number of viral plaques formed in trypsin-treated cells exposed to PR8 HA0. matriptase is capable of proteolytic cleavage of influenza virus hemagglutinin and promotes multicycle replication of the virus. Avicel semifluid medium containing either 43 nM TPCK-trypsin, 43 nM matriptase, or no enzyme was added to the cells, which were further incubated for 48 h. viral plaques were revealed and counted. uninfected Calu-3 cells were stained with anti-matriptase, anti-EEA-1 and anti-H1 antibodies. colocalization of fluorescence in longitudinal cross-sections of cells was analyzed. matriptase localizes to the plasma membrane and to endosomes. subconfluent submerged Calu-3 cells grown on glass coverslips were infected with A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) at an MOI of 0.5 and were fixed, blocked, and sequentially stained. a representative longitudinal cross-section of cells is presented and shows staining of matriptase (Alexa Fluor 647; red), endosomes (EEA-1) (Alexa Fluor 488; green), HA (Alexa Fluor 594 the apical surface of the cells was sampled by washing with culture medium. the PR8 virus increasingly replicated to high viral titers from 24 h to 72 h postinfection. similar results were obtained with submerged cells, but viral titers were lower over the time course. the virus titer was determined at 24, 48, and 72 h postinfection. submerged Calu-3 cells were transfected with 50 nM matriptase siRNA or scrambled siRNA using Lipofectamine RNAiMax. inhibitor based on the enzyme's autocatalytic site (P4 to P1 positions) coupled with a unique serine trap capable of covalently and reversibly binding to the enzyme resulting in a slow, tight-binding inhibitor (IN-1) (41). cells were infected, and IN-1 was added at increasing concentrations to the incubation medium. inhibition of matriptase by the slow, tight-binding inhibitor IN-1 significantly blocks influenza virus replication in human bronchial epithelial cells. tase was also involved in proteolytic activation of this H1N1 virus. se mRNA is expressed by human bronchial epithelial cell lines Calu-3 and NCI-H292 but not by the alveolar epithelial cell line A-549. TMPRSS2 was strongly expressed in normal human lung, but expression of TMPRSS2 was weaker than matriptase in Calu-3 cells. a representative immunoblot showed the level of matriptase in human bronchial epithelial cells (Calu-3, Calu-3 cultured under air-liquid conditions [Calu-3 A-L], NCI-H292, and NHBE). Equivalent protein amounts (35 g) were loaded in each well of the gel. matriptase was more strongly expressed under polarizing conditions. these results confirm the presence of matriptase in human bronchial epithelial cells. results from epifluorescence microscopy showed concentrated green fluorescence. trypsin cleaved all three consensus sequences with similar efficiencies. matriptase was far superior at cleaving this peptide than peptides containing HA cleavage sites. the ability of matriptase to cleave H1 (IQSRGLFG), H2 (IESRGLFG) and H3 (KQTRGLFG) consensus cleavage sequences was evaluated. an IQFP peptide representing the optimal cleavage sequence of matriptase was also used to assess the matriptase maximal cleavage efficiency. 62.7% 3.0% of viral HA was cleaved by matriptase at 500 nM. 26.8% 3.1% was cleaved at 200 nM. no significant cleavage was observed with the X-31 hemagglutinin. PR8 HA0 (H1N1) virus cleavage activity assessed with different concentrations of matriptase (200 to 500 nM) in Tris buffer (pH 7.4) during 2 h. X-31 HA0 (H3N2) virus cleavage activity was assessed with different concentrations of matriptase (200 to 500 nM) in Tris buffer (pH 7.4) during 2 h. we incubated whole PR8 viruses with 500 nM matriptase (catalytic domain) for 30 min in buffers with pHs ranging form 5 to 9. matriptase was able to cleave PR8 H1 within 30 min. this cleavage was efficient up to pH 7.4. the cleavage/activation of influenza virus HA by matriptase led to functional multicycle replication of the virus. we performed standard viral plaque assays in MDCK cells with the H1N1 PR8 virus or the H3N2 X-31 virus. however, trypsin by matriptase was the activating exogenous protease used to generate viral plaques. matriptase was able to support multicycle replication of both viruses in a dose-dependent manner. but since the HA of the HA1 virus was initially almost exclusively cleaved, this virus had a significant advantage in the number of internalized and activated viruses capable of forming potential viral plaques from multiple replication cycles. matriptase is capable of promoting multicycle replication of influenza virus. the catalytic domain of matriptase is capable of promoting multicycle replication of the virus. matriptase is expressed at the apical surface and in endosomes of human bronchial epithelial cells. further probing of matriptase's localization using specific anti-matriptase antibodies and confocal microscopy showed that matriptase was also expressed in compartmentalized vesicles within the cell cytoplasm. matriptase localizes to the plasma membrane and to endosomes and colocalizes with influenza HA. cells grown on transwell inserts at an air-liquid interface (ALI) for 10 days. inserts were then fixed and embedded in paraffin. quantitative analyses of colocalization were performed four times. matriptase is involved in multicycle replication of influenza virus in human bronchial epithelial cells. we infected polarized Calu-3 cells with the PR8 virus for 1 h. a significant reduction (up to 1.5 log) in viral titers in Calu-3 cells transfected with matriptase siRNA compared to nontransfected cells or scrambled siRNA-transfected control cells. these results demonstrate for the first time that matriptase is involved in multicycle replication of H1N1 influenza virus in human bronchial epithelial cells. supernatants were collected at 92 h posttransfection at an MOI of 0.0001. data represent means standard errors of the means of duplicate samples. paired t test was used to analyze the data. compound 21 was also able to block H1N1 influenza virus replication in Calu-3 cells. compound 21 was nine times less effective than IN-1 (EC50 of 50.21 M for PR8) infected cells with an A/California-like/09 pandemic. the influenza virus uses its surface hemagglutinin protein (HA1 subunit) to bind to sialic acids at the cell surface. 2-6-linked sialic acids are preferred by human viruses and 2-3-linked sialic acids are preferred by avian viruses. the virus is rapidly internalized into clathrin-coated pits (45) extracellular proteases, such as tryptase Clara and mast cell tryptase, and proteases involved in thrombolysis have been shown to possess HA cleavage capacities in vitro. more recently, a new family of membrane-bound serine proteases has been implicated in influenza virus HA cleavage/activation. matriptase is a trypsin-like serine protease with specific proteolytic activity downstream of an arginine residue at the cleavage site (55) matriptase has the ability to proteolytically cleave internally quenched fluorescent peptides designed to represent the consensus cleavage sequences of influenza virus hemagglutinins, but not H2 (IESR GLFG) the efficiency of matriptase at cleaving influenza virus consensus sequences in general is reduced compared to that of trypsin and that of an optimal peptide (39). this suggests even inefficient cleavage of influenza virus consensus sequences might be sufficient to promote viral infection. matriptase did not cleave the H3-bearing X-31 virus though it did cleave the H3 consensus sequence peptide with efficiency similar to that for the H1 consensus sequence. results suggest other protein determinants, such as tertiary structure and glycosylation, are important for the accessibility of matriptase to the cleavage site. soluble form of matriptase supports multicycle replication of influenza virus. soluble form of matriptase is capable of supporting viral plaque formation. soluble form of matriptase has the ability to support multicycle replication. confocal microscopy showed that matriptase localizes to the apical surface of the plasma membrane, where it can interact with and proteolytically activate influenza virus HA. matriptase has a pH optimum of 8 to 9 in cleaving its autocatalytic sequence RQAR VVGG (39) our data provide for the first time a three-pronged model of proteolytic influenza virus HA activation by the TTSP matriptase. our model proposes that cleavage can first occur outside the cell by the shed/soluble form, at the cell surface during attachment or exit of the virus in either the shed or membrane-bound form, or within endosomes where viral fusion occurs. matriptase in its shed form could activate HA of incoming viruses in extracellular space. hemagglutinin cleavage could occur in endosomes where viral fusion takes place. matriptase in its membrane-bound form could activate HA of incoming viruses. the ketobenzothiazole serine trap of IN-1 is designed to form a covalent, yet reversible, bond with the catalytic serine residue of the protease. the binding kinetics of IN-1 follow a tight-binding inhibition pattern, where IN-1 had a Ki of 0.011 nM (41) serine trap-like inhibitors boceprevir and telaprevir have recently been approved by the FDA against hepatitis C virus protease NS3-A4 (60). current anti-influenza drugs target viral proteins (neuraminidase and ion channel M2) but the emergence of viral resistance to these drugs underscore the need for novel strategies to fight the disease. the limited knowledge of host proteases involved in influenza virus HA activation has hindered the development of novel therapeutic strategies that target the host instead of the virus. here, we provide a novel class of selective, slow, tight-binding, reversible serine trap inhibitors capable of targeting a host TTSP and significantly blocking influenza virus production in human bronchial epithelial cells."}
