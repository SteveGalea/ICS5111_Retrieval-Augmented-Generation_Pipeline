{"summary": "IBV is a member of the family Coronaviridae and genus Coronavirus. it is a single stranded positive sense, enveloped RNA virus 27\u201332 kb in length. nephritis, proventriculitis and reduction in both laying rate and egg quality in infected chickens. cell apoptosis induced by virus may cause tissue damage, especially in the immune and nervous systems. apoptosis of infected cells can directly interfere with viral replication. there is limited information about the apoptosis signaling pathways induced by IBV infection in immune cells. morphological variations in IBV-infected cells revealed cell apoptosis was induced by IBV infection. cell apoptosis appeared to activate caspase-8 by the Fas/Fas ligand (FasL)-mediated signaling pathway. caspase-9 by the B-cell lymphoma 2 family-mediated signaling pathway. TCID50 was applied to HD11 cells to quantitate virus titers. ten-fold dilutions of the virus were prepared in DMEM. cells were infected with the virus and then observed daily for cytopathic effects. the cells were immobilized with 4% paraformaldehyde (KeyGEN Biotech, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China) at the specified time points, the cells were immobilized with 4% paraformaldehyde (KeyGEN Biotech, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China) for 30 min and then incubated with Hoechst 33342 (KeyGEN Biotech) in the dark for 15 min. HD11 cells were cultured in 6-well plates and infected with IBV at 10 MOI. cells were harvested and washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) cells were infected with FITC-conjugated annexin V antibody and 5 L propidium iodide. qRT-PCR reactions included 2 L cDNA, 12.5 L SYBR Premix Ex TaqTM II (Takara), 1.0 L of forward and 1.0 L of reverse primer and 8.5 L RNAase-free water (Takara). -actin was selected as a reference gene. -actin was selected as a reference gene. a p-value 0.05 was considered significant, and a p-value 0.01 was considered highly significant. HD11 cells were cultured in 96-well plates, and ten-fold. dilutions of the virus were prepared in DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS. cells were infected with the virus at 10 multiplicity of infection (MOI) cells were collected at the indicated time points and analyzed using TCID50 assay. the typical apoptotic changes were observed using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX71, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) the cells were grown overnight to 75% density in 96-well plates and were then infected with IBV at 10 MOI. ifuged at 500 g for 5 min and then suspended in 500 L of binding buffer containing 5 L FITC-conjugated annexin V antibody and 5 L propidium iodide. cells were detected by flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) within an hour. a p-value 0.05 was considered significant, and a p-value 0.01 was considered highly significant. a p-value 0.01 was considered highly significant. the infected cells were blindly passaged five times, and no significant replication was observed. the results showed that HD11 cells could be infected by IBV Beaudette in passage one. BV Beaudette infection by 24 and 36 h post-infection (h.p.i.) and mock-infected HD11 cells showed no CPE. data are shown as the mean standard error of the mean (SEM) of three independent experiments. IBV Beaudette-infected cells were subjected to flow cytometry at different times. the activity of caspases that play important roles in the activation of the apoptosis pathway was investigated in this study. caspase-3 activation and IBV Beaudette-induced apoptosis may be triggered via both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. caspases -3, -8 and -9 activity in HD11 cells was determined. the activity of caspase-8 was increased in the IBV Beaudette-infected HD11 cells. this implied that apoptosis is induced by IBV Beaudette infection through the Fas/FasL pathway. expression levels of Fas and FasL were detected in IBV Beaudette-infected HD11 cells. the activation of caspase-8 can also affect the extrinsic apoptosis pathway in IBV Beaudette-infected cells. the activation of caspase-8 can also affect the extrinsic apoptosis pathway. the virus titer was significantly decreased with NH4Cl treatment. the rate of apoptotic cells was also decreased in NH4Cl-treated cells. apoptosis induction required viral replication in IBV Beaudette-infected cells. UV-inactivated virus infected HD11 cells for 36 h. virus titer (D) and rate of apoptotic cells (E) were measured separately. data are shown as the mean SEM. IBV Beaudette replication in HD11 cells was also studied by performing an immunofluorescence assay. production of FITC-stained virus was observed by 24 h.p.i. mock-infected HD11 cells showed no fluorescence. HD11 cells were infected with IBV Beaudette at different MOIs. the activity of caspases that play important roles in the activation of the apoptosis pathway was investigated. caspase-3 activation and IBV Beaudette-induced apoptosis may be triggered via both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. caspase-3 activation and IBV Beaudette-induced apoptosis may be triggered via both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. caspase-8 or -9 activity was detected using a colorimetric assay kit. data are shown as the mean SEM, * p 0.05, ** p 0.01 versus virus infection alone. the activation of caspase-9 was partly inhibited in IBV Beaudette-infected cells pretreated with the inhibitor of caspase-8. the activation of caspase-8 can also affect the extrinsic apoptosis pathway in IBV Beaudette-infected cells. virus titers of untreated cells or those treated with caspase inhibitors were detected by TCID50. results showed that caspase-3 inhibitor could increase the titer of IBV Beaudette. titer was significantly decreased with NH4Cl treatment. a 30 M concentration of NH4Cl was used to incubate HD11 cells for 2 h. cells were infected with IBV Beaudette of 10 MOI for 36 h. the virus titer (B) and the rate of apoptotic cells (C) were separately tested. BV Beaudette infection showed that CPE can be observed after 24 h.p.i. the chicken macrophage HD11 cells will serve as an essential tool for future studies. some viruses have exhibited cell apoptosis that is mediated by Fas/FasL signaling as a reaction to viral infection. caspase-8 activation in IBV Beaudette-infected cells was regulated by Fas and FasL. caspase-3 activation and virus-induced apoptosis might be triggered through both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. some viruses can induce cell apoptosis through viral replication. UV-inactivated BHV-1 and TGEV could not induce apoptosis. some other viruses can induce apoptosis without viral replication. CHIKV infection induces apoptosis and enhances expression of major histocompatibility complexes. but little is known about IBV-induced immune cell apoptosis in the host. chicken macrophage HD11 cells were established for attenuated IBV strain Beaudette infection."}
