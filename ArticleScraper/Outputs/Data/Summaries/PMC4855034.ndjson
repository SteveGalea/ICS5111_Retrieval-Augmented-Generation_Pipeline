{"summary": "rotavirus is one of the major causes of acute gastroenteritis in infants and young children. despite the administration of rotavirus vaccines, rotavirus still accounts for an estimated 2 million hospitalizations per year. hospitalizations of older children and adults for diarrhea have greatly decreased after the introduction of infant rotavirus vaccination. despite wide coverage, antibodies induced by vaccination cannot totally prevent rotavirus infections of some rotavirus genotypes. these findings imply that new generation vaccines and complementary preventive approaches are needed to decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with rotavirus diarrhea. strain B. longum subsp. infantis CECT 7210 exerts a direct in vitro effect on rotavirus infection in HT-29 and MA-104 cell lines. an in vivo effect was shown to involve both antiviral effects and immunological enhancement, providing preliminary protection against the rotavirus infection in a mouse model. human rotavirus strain VA70 (G4-P1A[8]) and porcine rotavirus strain Ito (G3-P1A[8]) were a gift from Prof. Albert Bosch. supernatant was neutralized to pH 6.5 with NaOH (10N), 10x concentrated by freeze-drying and sterilized by 0.22-m-pore-size filter. a freeze-dried sample was re-suspended in 2.4 mL phosphate buffer solution (50 mM, pH 6.9) then 0.1 mL lipase from porcine pancreas was added. in the case of proteinase K, freeze-dried sample was re-suspended in 2.4 mL of phosphate buffer 50 mM pH 6.5. this mixture was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2 h, and then proteinase K was inactivated by incubation at 100\u00b0C for 15 min. a solution containing cells and viruses was used as a negative control of inhibition. the proteins were eluted simultaneously in a few fractions in minimal volume (10 mL) each collected fraction was subjected to an ultrafiltration process using 5,000 Da filters. an aliquot of these fractions was taken to dryness to eliminate the dissolvent and re-suspended in a volume of MEM buffer. anionic proteins were eluted with buffer Tris-HCl (20mM, pH 8.5, CaCl2 5 mM) using a gradient of NaCl from 0 to 1 M. samples were monitored at 280 nm throughout elution and protease activity measured with BSA as a substrate following Bradford (1976) matic activity assay was performed with -casein as substrate and purified protease from CECT 7210 supernatant as enzyme. hydrolysis was carried out in a solution containing 15 ml of protease-purified fraction (0.04 U), 30 mL of 2% -casein solution (BioUltra, Sigma\u2013Aldrich) and 105 mL phosphate citrate buffer (50 mM pH 6.4) enzymatic reactions were performed with -casein as substrate. -casein degradation and 11-mer formation were monitored by HPLC. -casein solution (2% w/v) was incubated with purified protease at 50\u00b0C. samples were boiled and 0.45 m pore-size filtered. a control was included without the addition of any mineral. results obtained were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 4 software. in all cases, cell monolayers were grown in 96-well plates. the tested compounds were incubated with rotavirus followed by the inoculation of the virus (strategy B) in both cases, viral antigens were detected by immunoperoxidase assays. a freeze-dried sample (from 25 mL supernatant) was re-suspended in 2.4 mL phosphate buffer solution (50 mM, pH 6.9) then 0.1 mL lipase from porcine pancreas was added. the mixture was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2 h, and the reaction was inactivated taking the solution to pH 4.5. the negative controls included in these tests were supernatant of culture medium MRSC without inoculation (C1) and the same supernatant incubated for 2 h at 37\u00b0C (QC3) control with non-inactivated proteinase K supernatant could not be tested due to post-incubation cell lysis. the fractions that gave a positive inhibition result were analyzed by MALDI-TOF peptide mass fingerprinting at the \u201cCentro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares\u201d (CNIC, Madrid, Spain) the fractions that gave a positive inhibition result were analyzed by MALDI-TOF peptide mass fingerprinting at the \u201cCentro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares\u201d. a freeze-dried sample (from 25 mL supernatant) was re-suspended in 1.25 mL of phosphate buffer 50 mM pH 4.0. this mixture was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2 h, and the reaction was inactivated taking the solution to pH 4.5. the supernatant was added to sodium phosphate buffer (20 mM, pH 5.8) and then applied to a cationic exchange column. all those proteins of cationic nature adsorbed were then eluted with sodium phosphate buffer (20 mM, pH 5.8) and equilibrated with NaCl 1M without gradient. each fraction was subjected to an ultrafiltration process using 5,000 Da filters. strain B. longum subsp. infantis CECT 7210 in MRSC medium was obtained and centrifuged at 12,000 g for 15 min under refrigerated conditions. proteins precipitated by the addition of ammonium sulfate (80% saturation) and collected by centrifugation (30 min, 12,000 g) pellet was resuspended in Tris-HCl buffer (Tris-HCl 20 mM, pH 8.5, CaCl2 5 the single band was separated and analyzed by MALDI-TOF peptide mass fingerprinting at CNIC, to determine the molecular weight and sequence of the protein. Sequence obtained was compared against the database of proteins/peptides by means of the BLAST online tool. a volume of 1 L culture of strain B. longum subsp. infantis CECT 7210 in MRSC medium was obtained and centrifuged at 12,000 g for 15 min under refrigerated conditions. anionic proteins were eluted with buffer Tris-HCl (20mM, pH 8.5, CaCl2 5 mM) using a gradient of NaCl from 0 to 1 M. the single band was separated and analyzed by MALDI-TOF peptide mass fingerprinting at CNIC, to determine the molecular weight and sequence of the protein. Sequence obtained was compared against the database of proteins/peptides using the BLAST online tool. protease activity was assayed in supernatants of strain CECT 7210. protease activity was measured in supernatants after 17 h of growth. enzymatic reactions were performed with -casein as substrate. influence of zinc, potassium, and calcium on protease activity was studied. assay carried out with -casein (2% w/v) as substrate and 70 L citrate-phosphate buffer (pH 6.4, 50 mM) incubation conditions were 50\u00b0C for 72 h. casein solution (2% w/v; 20 mL) was incubated with purified protease for 72 h. the hydrolysis reaction was carried out in a solution with purified protease (10 mL), -casein solution (2% w/v; 20 mL) and PBS buffer (70 mL), at pH 4, 6, 7, 8, and 10. after incubation, samples were boiled for 10 min to stop the reaction. analysis of rotavirus SA11 proliferation for the aliquots processed by lipases showed no changes in supernatant rotavirus inhibition values. supernatant treated with proteases showed no inhibition of rotavirus infection via either strategy A or B. a total of 28 fractions of reverse phase were selected for rotavirus inhibition assays. of these, only six fractions rendered a significant reduction in infected foci. the only common signal in all the selected fractions corresponded to a peptide with a molecular weight of 1,282.63 Da. control 100.0 10.9 Results are the average of at least two independent experiments.
