{"summary": "ARDS is a syndrome associated with diffuse alveolar damage, severe hypoxemia, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, and bilateral pulmonary infiltrate (232). ARDS has a reported incidence of 86 per 100,000 people per year. there are 190,000 cases of ARDS in the united states (219) the united states (53) is the most fatal fibrotic disease since it only has a median survival of three to five years after diagnosis. there were no treatments for IPF until the recent FDA approval of two drugs, i.e., pirfenidone (127) and nintedanib (212). pirfenidone reduced the percentage of patients with disease progression from 31.8 to 16.5% and increased the percentage of patients with stable pulmonary function. alveolar epithelial and endothelial cell wounding occurs upon physical stresses to the lung. alveolar epithelial and endothelial cells are wounded and consequently trigger cell death (150) without effective repairs. mechanical stress caused an increase in alveolar permeability, likely due to perturbation of intercellular tight-junction and alveolar-capillary barrier structures in endothelial cells. cell death may occur through apoptosis, necrosis, necroptosis, and other undefined mechanism(s) in injurious pulmonary diseases. etiological factor for pulmonary fibrosis causes epithelial cell loss on one hand and stimulates uncontrolled fibroblast proliferation on the other hand. chronic epithelial cell injury and abnormal repair may be the initiating factor to stimulate mesenchymal cell proliferation of fibrogenesis. pathophysiological hallmarks of ARDS are diffuse alveolar damage, surfactant dysfunction, and activation of inflammatory responses (289). prolonged cell injury stimulates fibrogenesis of mesenchymal cells through inappropriate epithelium and mesenchyme cross talk. mesenchymal-like cells may also feed back on epithelial cells to promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) sudden increases in epithelial injury may be one of the underlying causes for acute exacerbation of IPF (117) surfactant is a lipoprotein complex that reduces surface tension and assists with innate host defense of the lung (254) it is composed of 90% lipids and 10% surfactant-associated proteins (SPs), including SP-A, -B, -C, and -D. the overall biophysical consequence of surfactant dysfunction is heterogeneous compliance at local lung regions. a previous report showed that loss of SP-D may enhance sensitivity of the lung to hyperoxia-, ozone-, and bleomycin-induced injury. however, lack of functional surfactant alone does not recapitulate the fibrotic changes of IPF but rather aggravates bleomycin-induced lung pathology in mouse models (8, 142) alveolar walls more or less unfold and refold during normal breathing. in the uninjured lung, alveolar walls more or less unfold and refold during normal breathing. in ARDS, the egress of proteinaceous fluid in the alveolar space represents a collapse force that decreases lung compliance. ards lung is particularly vulnerable to all above biophysical injury mechanisms. proinflammatory cytokines often turn on downstream signaling pathways that either produce membrane-injury products or cause compromised plasma membrane integrity. terminal kinases, or p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases, produce mediators with high plasma membrane and systemic toxicity. binding of TNF to TNFR1 may also trigger cell death pathways (89) through apoptosis in cells with low levels of receptor-interacting protein (RIP) 3 or necroptosis in cells with a sufficient amount of RIP3 (89), the latter being a particular type of cell death mode characterized by cytoplasm gran tsky and colleagues put forward the notion of \"biotrauma\" based on their experimental findings. prolonged injury may provide both the primary antigens and immune adjuvants. delayed clearance of apoptotic cells may induce secondary necrosis with the release of intracellular contents to stimulate immune response. gram-positive cocci Staphylococcus aureus produce -toxin. -toxin has been shown to create small pores of 2 nm in diameter. host cells likely use Ca2+-independent endocytic and exosomal shedding mechanisms to close these pores in a slow process. cytotoxin injected through this system disrupts lipid metabolism and membrane integrity of the targeted lung epithelial cells and macrophages. a common gram-positive rod produces a lethal toxin that destroys lung epithelial barrier function and interferes with injury repair by immobilizing the actin and microtubule network. fibrosis worsened in mice administered with fibrogenic agents such as bleomycin or fluorescein isothiocyanate. viral infection alone did not trigger fibrotic changes in young adult mice. cigarette smoking is a main one among environmental risk factors for pulmonary diseases. smoking causes a collection of pathophysiological changes such as inducing profibrotic gene expression, weakening of the immune system, and stimulating proinflammatory responses. smoking can increase permeability of alveolar epithelial cells (116) and that of the endothelium (93, 224), and such action was largely attributed to ROS production. oxidative agent H2O2 is often used as a reagent to induce nonspecific cell injury via oxidative stress studies showed that contact with concentrated acid causes membrane pore formation in alveolar epithelial cells. this transient poration sufficiently induced an unusual and transitory proinflammatory response of the alveolar epithelium. acid aspiration may also work in concert with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to disrupt barrier function and alter lung mechanics. d current knowledge on the biophysical mechanisms through which they eventually cause plasma membrane damage and cell death is of great value. we aim to collect a holistic view of these injurious stimuli under the premise that cell wounding and repair is critically important for the pathogenesis and possibly prognosis of both ARDS and IPF. surfactant dysfunction can be induced by transforming growth factor (TGF)- overexpression before the presence of profibrotic lung remodeling (157). mechanical ventilation has also been shown to alter the organization and function of surfactant complex (254). surfactant dysfunction contributes to alveolar epithelial cell injury. lack of functional surfactant alone does not recapitulate the fibrotic changes of IPF but rather aggravates bleomycin-induced lung pathology. biophysical mechanisms alone can cause physiologically significant cellular injury in the lung. in absence of previous lung injuries, mechanical ventilation could induce lung pathologies in animal models. in ARDS, the egress of proteinaceous fluid in the alveolar space in conjunction with large alveolar area oscillations impair surfactant function. increased alveolar surface tension further stresses the cell and tissue attachments at the boundary of the collapsing lung segments. the need to support gas exchange through oxygen supplementation (119) increases the risk of iatrogenic lung insults. proinflammatory cytokines can mediate cell injury and death through well-known and newly emerging mechanisms. chemokines attract immune cells, including neutrophils to infiltrate the lung. persistent neutrophil inflammation is an important indicator of tissue injury (75) and multiorgan failure in ARDS (170), since sequestered neutrophils may injure epithelial and endothelial layers through degranulation, oxidative burst. almost all types of bacteria produce pore-forming toxins (PFTs) that cause damage to a plasma membrane by direct pore formation. Bacterial pneumonia and sepsis are the leading cause and frequent complication of ARDS (62) aeruginosa secretes PFTs that create approximately 3.5- to 8-nm pores on host cell membranes (55, 230), which was used as a type III secretion system for injection of other injurious cytotoxins in the host cells. aeruginosa are opportunistic gram-negative rods causing severe lung infections in immunocompromised patients. RIP kinase 3-mediated necroptosis of macrophages was activated by PFTs from pulmonary pathogens. inhibition of necroptosis regulators improved the outcome of pneumonia in animal models. viral pneumonia may evolve into ARDS (165), notably influenza viruses H5N1 and H1N1 and coronavirus. virus infection triggers cytokine and chemokine release from activated immune cells, including neutrophil-attracting chemokines. proinflammatory cytokines and tissue-infiltrated neutrophils cause lung injury. cigarette smoking is a main one among environmental risk factors for pulmonary diseases. oxidative agent H2O2 is often used as a reagent to induce nonspecific cell injury via oxidative stress. oxidative agent can also activate the unfolded protein response (UPR) and induce ER stress and ultimately apoptosis in lung cells. hypercapnic acidosis significantly increased the percentage of cell wounding in ventilated lungs (57), and buffering hypercapnic acidosis to neutral pH rescued cell wounding (36), supporting the direct cell lytic effect of protons. the whole body effects of hypercapnic acidosis are more complex and somewhat contradictory, precluding its possible clinical application (54) the distribution of cell wounding and injured cell types in the lung would determine disease symptoms and pathology severity. in most cases cell wounding resolves well, as in ARDS, but others go on to develop fibrotic diseases. defects in membrane repair have been shown to be involved in a number of human diseases, including muscular dystrophy and cardiovascular diseases. membrane repair mechanisms to rescue the fate of mildly injured cells are necessities for normal function of the lung. previous studies indicated that lung cells engage plasma membrane repair in a similar manner to those in striated muscle and kidney. lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) is deactivated by ATP receptor, purinergic receptor P2Y (P2Y2R), and affects the activity of neighbor cells. ca2+-mediated repair patch exocytosis is essential to remove the lung cell membrane defects with coordination of LAMP1, TRIM72, and de novo lipid synthesis. studies using immortalized lung cell lines and primary alveolar epithelial cells showed that stretching induces lipid trafficking to and from the plasma membrane in a process termed deformation-induced lipid trafficking (DILT) in lung cells, stretching induces lipid trafficking in a process termed deformation-induced lipid trafficking (177, 259) lysosome fusion inhibitor vacuolin can interfere with membrane repair and ca2+-dependent exocytosis. prior studies suggest endocytosis is also indispensable for successful repair of plasma membrane wounding (50, 106, 242) a biocompatible copolymer is able to insert lipid bilayer (184) and thus increase the plasma membrane lipid reservoir. studies showed that P188 was effective in improving cell injury and tissue pathology in muscular dystrophy, heart failure, neurodegenerative disorders, and electroporation damage to cells. the inhibition on DILI by cytochalasin D to depolymerize actin was overwhelming. but the differences in orientation, magnitude, topographical distribution of the stress within the cell would likely also modify the cell\u2019s response to deformation. softer cell would instead be more susceptible to interfacial stress due to air-liquid movements or fracture of liquid bridges. studies on the contribution of ATP release in wound repair have just started. it is known that ATP is released from contracting muscles, inflamed cells and wounded cells (286) noninjurious stretching is sufficient to cause low-level ATP release and initiate purinergic signaling in alveolar epithelial cells. extracellular ATP produced by inflammation and injured cells could induce a rapid and dose-dependent increase in transendothelial electrical resistance across pulmonary endothelial cells. released ATP from stressed cells may be able to turn on certain fibrotic pathways (161, 250), and signals conducted by binding of UTP/ATP to P2Y2 receptors were shown to have profibrotic effects. tripartite motif-containing protein (TRIM) 72 was first identified from skeletal muscle. TRIM proteins were named for their conserved RING, B-box, and coiled-coil domains at the NH2-terminus. TRIM72 contains an additional PRY-SPRY domain at its COOH-terminus. recombinant TRIM72 tends to polymerize through cysteine residues. nonmuscle myosin type IIA served as a motor to translocate TRIM72. cholesterol content in the plasma membrane was shown to greatly affect cell translocation of TRIM72. human heart tissue had no TRIM72 expression unlike the mouse heart (146), suggesting species disparities in tissue repair. recombinant TRIM72 reduced increase in end-expiratory lung volume and Lm in mouse models of emphysema. studies by corrotte et al. showed caveolar endocytosis is an indispensable step for the success of plasma membrane repair by removing pores formed by PFTs on the plasma membrane. previous studies also found that caveolae structures were disturbed during acute kidney injury by oxidative stress. upregulation of Cav1 was linked to survival of renal cells (167, 287) mutagenesis studies found that all four domains of TRIM72 and Cav1 interaction were required for TRIM72 and Cav1 interaction. ATIs are more likely to repair PM defects than ATII cells (82), whereas coincidentally ATII cells are historically known to lack Cav1 (34). cell senses disruption at the plasma membrane and locates the wound. endocytosis or exocytosis is engaged to mobilize endomembrane lipid vesicles. repair vesicles fuse together with the wound edges to form a repair patch at the injury site. a significant increase in cell surface area and incorporation of intracellular lipid vesicles in the existing plasma membrane as a cytoprotective mechanism 260. low temperature and cholesterol depletion inhibited lipid trafficking to the plasma membrane and compromised the ability of immortalized and primary lung epithelial cells to repair membrane wounds. however, the injury resistance and repair ability of cell lines and different types of primary lung cells differ substantially. enzyme acid sphingomyelinase in an exocytosis process to promote endocytosis during plasma membrane repair (106, 242) the potential beneficial role of endocytosis inspired an experimental therapy for cystic fibrosis that facilitates mucociliary clearance by restoring the liquid layer lining the airways. endocytic and exocytic mechanisms work together and maintain a favorable force balance between edge energy and plasma membrane-cytoskeleton adhesion (83). a softer cell is less stressed due to the effective release and spreading of applied lateral loads, but the inhibition on DILI by cytochalasin D to depolymerize actin was overwhelming. a softer cell would instead be more susceptible to interfacial stress due to air-liquid movements or fractures. the role of CSK in cell wounding repair is also dynamic in nature. the initial depolymerization of the subcortical cytoskeleton network is thought to remove the barrier for endomembrane lipid trafficking. the reestablishment of the actin network is likely for anchoring repair patches and restoring cell morphology. ATP binding to P2Y receptors on neighboring cells induces protein kinase C-dependent oxidative activation of TNF--converting enzyme. extracellular ATP produced by inflammation and injured cells could induce a rapid and dose-dependent increase in transendothelial electrical resistance across pulmonary endothelial cells. ATP release has no effect on mechanical stretch-induced Ca2+ influx in human lung fibroblasts. tripartite motif-containing protein 72 was first identified from skeletal muscle. TRIM proteins were named for their conserved RING, B-box, and coiled-coil domains. the RING domain of TRIM72 was indicated in E3 ubiquitination of insulin receptor substrate 1. absence of TRIM72 increases susceptibility to ventilation-induced lung injury. overexpression via an inducible transgenic model is protective for ventilation-induced lung cell death. previous studies showed that TRIM72 localizes at plasma membrane and vesicle complexes close to the membrane. nonmuscle myosin type IIA served as a motor to translocate TRIM72. cholesterol content in the plasma membrane was shown to greatly affect injury-induced membrane translocation of TRIM72 and cell repair in ischemia-reperfusion injury (271). however, these repair modifiers of TRIM72 have yet to be verified by other independent studies. caveolins play major roles in endocytosis and cell signal transduction (201) there are three subtypes of caveolins, i.e., Cav1, Cav2, and Cav3, while Cav1 is the main type of caveolar protein in ATI cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells in the lungs. primary ATI cells from trim72/ lung had reduced membrane localization of Cav1 (125, 190) TRIM72-Cav1 double-knockout mice showed increased apoptotic cell death in the lung following overventilation compared with either single knockout alone or the wild-type lung (190). this finding suggests that a direct link between TRIM72 and caveolar endocytosis collaboratively repairs wounding of lung epithelial cells. preliminary investigation by Godin showed that ATIs are more likely to repair PM defects than ATII cells (82) whereas coincidentally ATII cells are historically known to lack Cav1 (34) the repair phenotypes of different types of lung cells that harbor variable repair molecules need to be carefully characterized. repeated or persistent microinjury of the lung epithelium can also cause overactivation of the profibrotic signaling pathways (225), with the aid of reactivation of developmental signaling pathways. epithelial injury promotes the secretion of sonic hedgehog (SHH) from injured epithelial cells. notch signaling promotes EMT in epithelial cells and activation of fibroblasts via the intracellular domain of the notch protein (NICD) ER stress induces the expression of binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP). ER stress induces the expression of binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP) epithelial-specific TGFRII deficiency protects lung from bleomycin-induced fibrosis, which is associated with improved epithelial survival and increased fibroblast apoptosis. both epithelial and mesenchymal TGF- signaling play important but distinct roles in mediating lung fibrosis. nt signaling controls vascular formation, ECM production, smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration, and epithelial cell maintenance and differentiation. but aberrant Wnt upregulation turns out to be more deleterious than beneficial. nt/-catenin activation promotes fibroblast expansion via the paracrine mode and thus increases collagen accumulation in the ECM. a few studies found upregulated SHH in epithelial cells of the fibrotic human lung. downstream signaling partners patched-1, smoothened, and GLI1 were present in fibroblasts and inflammatory cells (25, 236). inhibition of GLI decreases lung fibrosis and collagen accumulation (188). inhibition of Notch signaling promoted alveolar repair and reduced fibrosis in bleomycin-induced lung injury. ER stress plays a pivotal role in multiple pathogenic aspects of ARDS and IPF such as epithelial cell apoptosis. 154, 155, 192, suggesting that ER stress is critically involved in the pathogenesis of ARDS. ER stress triggers profibrotic factor expression in epithelial cells (28) and promotes EMT transition. t and coreceptor Lrp5 activation in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis (140) signaling pathways largely cause progenitor cell activation, mesenchymal cell expansion, and fibrogenesis. this is not clear with the exception of the TGF- signaling pathway, and partly the ER stress pathway. proliferative and fibrotic signals are part of the normal tissue healing process. failure of resolution leads to disease state. impact of cell wounding and repair on the \u201coff switch\u201d of these above signals may shed light on future research. both epithelial and mesenchymal TGF- signaling play important but distinct roles in mediating lung fibrosis. both epithelial and mesenchymal TGF- signaling play important but distinct roles in mediating lung fibrosis. sonic HH (SHH) signaling pathway is a developmental pathway that finely controls tissue polarity and architecture by distance-dependent ligand dispensing on target cells. a few studies found upregulated SHH in epithelial cells of the fibrotic human lung. a recent study by peng et al. showed that GLI1-positive cells were decreased in the parabronchial mesenchymal cells following chronic bleomycin injury to the lung. inhibition of notch signaling promoted alveolar repair and reduced fibrosis in bleomycin-injected lungs. ER stress plays a pivotal role in multiple pathogenic aspects of ARDS and IPF such as epithelial cell apoptosis, EMT, and inflammation. ER stress is a direct consequence of various injuries to lung cells, including environmental insults, viral infection, and cigarette smoking (196, 243) ER stress is not specific to ARDS or IPF, but severe ER stress is associated with lung epithelial cell death and fibrogenesis. Flodby et al. (72) created conditional binding immunoglobulin protein knockout specifically at ATII cells and found increased ATII cell apoptosis, oxidative stress, Smad3 phosphorylation. notch-induced differentiation is dependent on the TGF--Smad3 pathway. inhibition of endogenous Notch with small molecule inhibitor attenuated TGF--induced SMA expression (9) in endothelial cells, macrophages, and perivascular fibroblasts. prevailing signaling pathways known to be activated following lung epithelial injury. plasma membrane repair is a fundamental biological process, and key membrane repair steps are largely conserved. complex physical and biochemical tissue injury factors injure lung cells under pathological conditions. defective lung cell wounding leads to activation of aberrant tissue repair pathways following injury."}
