{"summary": "the cheetah population in Namibia is the largest free-ranging population of this vulnerable species. cheetahs have been considered highly susceptible to infectious diseases for more than 2 decades. evidence for fatal viral infections comes from an outbreak of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) in a captive population in the united states. cheetahs in north-central Namibia have higher seroprevalences of FHV, FCV, FCoV, and CDV than cheetahs in east-central Namibia (12, 13). cheetahs in north-central Namibia have higher seroprevalences of FHV, FCV, FCoV, and CDV than cheetahs in east-central Namibia (12, 21) 88 free-ranging cheetahs (63 males and 25 females) on commercial farmland in east-central Namibia were analyzed. thirty of the captive cheetahs were housed at the AfriCat Foundation, a nonprofit conservation facility for carnivores in central Namibia, and 26 on privately owned farms. free-ranging and captive animals were captured, anesthetized, sampled, clinically examined. captive animals were examined as part of annual health check-up. five plasma samples originated from cheetahs that had been vaccinated for several years. ks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) was stored in liquid nitrogen. plasma, serum, whole-blood samples and PBMCs were transported to Switzerland at 80\u00b0C on dry ice or at 196\u00b0C in a dry shipper. samples that reached optical density (OD) were considered true-positive. ELISAa free-ranging, captive nonvaccinated, and captive vaccinated cheetahs used for each test are presented in Table 1. a compilation of the numbers of animals and samples from free-ranging, captive nonvaccinated, and captive vaccinated cheetahs is presented in Table 1. 88 98 26 39 35 35 Sum 89 (100)b 98 (100) 28 (100)b 39 (100) 35 (100) 35 (100) a Samples with OD values of 20% (P27 and P45) or 22% (FL-74) were considered questionable. samples with OD values of 4% and 20% were considered questionable. antibodies were visually assessed by WB using 0.5 g of antigen per strip for each virus preparation. total nucleic acids were extracted from 100 l EDTA-treated blood (n = 41) and 100 l heparinized plasma (n = 71) glutamine (Invitrogen), 1% antibiotic/antimycotic (Invitrogen) and 10 l of concanavalin A (5 mg/ml; Sigma) were added. 5 ml of supernatant was collected, centrifuged for 10 min at 1,500 g. cells were frozen again and stored in liquid nitrogen. for nonvaccinated animals sampled repeatedly, we randomly selected one test result for the analyses. for the five captive animals tested both as nonvaccinated and as vaccinated, we used only the nonvaccinated results. results for male and female animals of each group were compared with Fisher's exact test. seven captive cheetahs were sampled twice, two were sampled three times. one animal was sampled as a free-ranging cheetah and then as a captive cheetah. intervals between repeated sampling times ranged between 1 month and 28 months. samples were collected from vena saphena or vena cephalica into heparin, serum, and EDTA blood collection tubes. samples were kept at 4\u00b0C during transport to the field station or the central veterinary laboratory in Windhoek, Namibia. all plasma, serum, and whole-blood samples were stored in liquid nitrogen. ELISA purified cheetahs by ultracentrifugation (FL-74) at a dilution of 1:200. antibody levels were assessed by comparison with predefined positive-control sera. the cutoff value was set at the mean value plus 2.58 times the standard deviation. 98 (100) 28 (100)b,c 39 (100) 35 (100) 35 (100) P45 >20% (positive) 1 (1) 1 (1) 3 (11) 6 (20) 25 (71) 25 (71) 20% (negative) 69 (99) 74 (99) 24 (89) 24 (80) 10 (29) 10 (29) 10 (29) 10 (29) 10 (29) Total tested 70 75 26 30 35 35 Sum 70 (100) 75 (100) 75 (100) 27 (100)b,c serum and 45 plasma samples from 45 captive cheetahs were tested. samples that showed antibodies to FeLV p27 plus one or two p15(E) fragments or to both p15(E) fragments only were considered positive. PCR assay for feline glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (fGAPDH) was determined by real-time reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR or real-time PCR. PBMCs were cultured in 5 ml medium consisting of RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma), 10% inactivated fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 1% l-glutamine (Invitrogen), RT activity was also assessed in 12 heparinized plasma samples. no inhibition was observed by testing a positive RT sample together with aliquots with and without heparin. all seven repeatedly tested free-ranging cheetahs and five of the seven repeatedly tested captive nonvaccinated cheetahs were negative in all tests. none of the five captive cheetahs that were sampled as nonvaccinated animals and 2 years later as vaccinated against FeLV turned positive. captive vaccinated cheetahs had higher OD levels than free-ranging (P 0.0001) and captive nonvaccinated (P 0.0001) cheetahs. the latter two had similar OD levels (P = 0.11). six of the seven repeatedly tested free-ranging cheetahs. antibodies to FL-74 virus increased with the time of presence in the AfriCat facility. free-ranging cheetahs had higher OD levels than free-ranging (P 0.0001) and captive nonvaccinated (P 0.0001) cheetahs had similar OD levels (P = 0.20) Western blot results for the presence of antibodies against FeLV p27 and FeLV p15(E) in free-ranging, captive nonvaccinated, and captive vaccinated cheetahs. samples were considered positive when antibodies were detected against FeLV p27. six FeLV-p15(E)-positive and six FeLV-p15(E)-negative samples from 12 free-ranging cheetahs were used to test antibody reactivity against four additional retroviruses. none of the cheetahs tested positive for all four tests performed. PCR assays for endogenous and exogenous FeLV were negative for all animals. positive-control samples had an activity range of 10,000 to 20,000 nU/ml. none of the study animals showed any clinical signs of an infectious disease. two of the five captive nonvaccinated cheetahs tested positive for both samples. only one of the animals turned negative to positive. captive vaccinated cheetahs had higher values than free-ranging cheetahs. seventeen free-ranging (19%), seven captive nonvaccinated (27%) and 30 captive vaccinated cheetahs (86%) tested positive. six of the seven repeatedly tested free-ranging cheetahs (86%) and five of the seven repeatedly tested captive nonvaccinated cheetahs (29%) revealed the same results for the repeated tests. vaccinated cheetahs had higher OD levels than free-ranging (P 0.0001) and captive nonvaccinated (P 0.0001) cheetahs. the latter two had similar OD levels (P = 0.20) of samples No. (%) of animals No. (%) of animals No. (%) of samples FeLVa Positive for both p15(E) fragments 13 (29) 16 (32) 6 (37) 10 (47) 23 (66) 23 (66) positive for p27 + p15(E) 14 (31) 15 (30) 4 (26) 5 (24) 1 (3) 1 (3) Negative 18 (40) 19 (38) 6 (37) 6 (29) 11 (31) 11 (31) Total tested 45 50 15 21 35 35 Sum 45 six RMuLV-p15(E)-positive samples were also FeLV-p15(E)-positive samples. none of the cheetahs tested positive for all four tests performed. there were no significant differences in the proportion of seropositive or seronegative males and females for p45 ELISA, FL-74 ELISA, and WB. the Kalahari Desert may act as a natural barrier, keeping the Namibian populations naive to pathogens present in adjacent countries (10, 11, 40, 41). the undetected retrovirus triggering measurable antibodies against FeLV and RMuLV in Namibian cheetahs might be an endemic one. the presence of reactive antibodies against RMuLV in all six FeLV-WB-positive samples may be due to the activation of endogenous gammaretroviruses not directly related to an infectious disease. teratospermia in cheetahs is not of major concern for captive or free-ranging populations. tectable antibody levels may have productive infections with high levels of replicating virus (48) negative PERT results may be due to complete repression of the virus in the antibody-positive animals or absence of infection in the antibody-negative animals. cheetahs may react to low-level exposure to FeLV like domestic cats. cheetah population can mount effective immune responses against the gammaretrovirus. low MHC variability, however, might limit immunocompetence of individuals. captive animals were preventively vaccinated with a vaccine widely used for domestic cats. the concept that boosting may induce increased levels of antibodies is not necessarily identical to protection. however, increased levels of antibodies are not necessarily identical to protection."}
