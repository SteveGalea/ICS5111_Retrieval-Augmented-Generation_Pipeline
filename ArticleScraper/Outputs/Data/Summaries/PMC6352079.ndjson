{"summary": "public health emergency preparedness (PHEP) is the primary task of emergency management. recent environmental disasters have revealed the limitation of government in real-time response and mobilization to help the public. media exposure can increase an individual\u2019s knowledge and trust in their government. media can help people learn about their immediate environment and potential threats therein. people can also be warned by the media in case of imminent danger by creating awareness among them. study participants in china, after the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, more attention had been paid to government information disclosure. traditional media (e.g., newspaper, magazine, radio, TV) were effectively used by the government to disclose public information, such as government performance and public service information. the study was conducted in four districts (Gongshu, Xiacheng, Shangcheng, and Xihu) of Hangzhou, China. a total of 747 questionnaires were collected and 702 were included in analysis. 45 questionnaires were discarded due to missing data. Cronbach\u2019s alpha was calculated for the traditional media exposure scale ( = 0.73) and for the new media exposure scale ( = 0.62) we measured knowledge by asking respondents to estimate the degree to which they knew about four types of public health. the scores for emergency supplies ranged from 0 (owned none of these) to 3 (owned all of the recommended supplies) we measured emergency preparedness behaviors by averaging them after normalization. previous studies have verified they can significantly affect emergency preparedness behaviors. x ( i ) represents the i - th ordered value and = i = 1 n S i, n x ( i ) 1 n i = 1 n x i (3) In order to obtain another value ( r ), the weights can be generalized as: ( r ) = 1 r i = 1 n s i, n r x ( i ) 1 n i = 1 n the model applied in this study is a serial multiple mediator model. it has three indirect effects and one direct effect. the three indirect paths are found by tracing all possible ways of getting from X to Y through at least one M: X M1 Y; X M2 Y; X M1 M2 Y. we found that official public health information disclosure on government websites is relatively flat every year. this was true even in 2013 during the Avian influenza A (H7N9) outbreak. in 2014, the government began to use WeChat and Micro. blog to release information. variables socio-demographic characteristics (N = 702) Age 20 years old and younger 21 3.0 21 to 30 years old 177 25.2 31 to 40 years old 188 26.8 40 to 50 years old 162 23.0 50 to 60 years old 119 17.0 older than 60 years old 35 5.0 Education less than high school 89 12.7 high school degree 131 18.7 junior college degree 144 20.5 bachelor\u2019s degree or higher 33 4.7 Annual family income lower than CNY 80,000 (USD 11,550) 24 we measured trust in government by asking respondents to estimate the degree to which they trust the government\u2019s capability to respond to public health emergencies. in this study, we divided preparedness behavior into cooperation behavior and supplies [29,30]. an intentionally biased bootstrapping technique is the resampling of explanatory variables with the response variables while increasing or decreasing the mean of the explanatory variable by a certain level. from this IBB, the effect of the response variable can be assessed by changing the mean [36,37]. weights can be generalized as: ( r ) = ( r ) = 1 r i = 1 n s i, n r x (4) where r = i = 1 n s i, n r and ( r ) = 1 n s i, n r and ( r ) = 1 n s i, n r and ( r ) = 1 n s i the indirect effect of X on Y through M1 is 16, the indirect effect through Model 2 is 53, the indirect effect through M1 and M2 in serial is 123, and the total indirect effect of X is 16+53+123. four-factor model: TME+NME; KN; GT; COOP; SUP 3.505 0.932 0.945 0.058 Five-factor model: TME+NME; KN; GT; COOP; SUP 3.953 0.920 0.935 0.063 Four-factor model: TME+NME; KN; GT; COOP; SUP 3.953 0.920 0.935 0.063 Four-factor model: TME+NME; KN+GT; COOP; GE = Gender, 1 = men, 2 = women; AG = Age, 1 = 20 years and younger, 2 = 21 to 30 years, 3 = 31 to 40 years, 4 = 40 to 50 years, 5 = 50 to 60 years, 6 = older than 60. media exposure had significant positive effects on PHEP. trust in government had significant positive effects on PHEP. ables R R 2 F T KN ME 0.345 0.119 18.750 * 0.363 8.481 * GT ME 0.328 0.108 13.995 * 0.111 2.411 ** KN 0.286 7.361 * PHEP ME 0.402 0.161 19.056 * 0.202 4.614 * KN 0.240 5.328 * GT 0.195 4.614 * Note. we built four scenarios with two types of media exposure and two types of PHEP. the most sensitive variable to change with COOP was government trust (GT), followed by knowledge (KN) and ME. the most sensitive factor to changes in SUP was KN. knowledge and trust in government can partly mediate the relationship between traditional media exposure and cooperation behaviors. knowledge can mediate the relationship between traditional media exposure and cooperation behaviors (indirect effect = 0.0289; 95% CI: [0.0165, 0.0463]) knowledge can mediate the relationship between traditional media exposure and emergency supply ownership behaviors (indirect effect = 0.1086; 95% CI: [0.0616, 0.1705]) exposure and cooperation behaviors was not significant (indirect effect = 0.0142; 95% CI: [0.0074, 0.0367]). knowledge and trust in government can partly mediate the relationship between new media exposure and emergency supply ownership behaviors (indirect effect = 0.0606; 95% CI: 0.0326, 0.1004) correlation coefficients among variables are reported in Table 3. the results provide initial support for the hypotheses in this study.
