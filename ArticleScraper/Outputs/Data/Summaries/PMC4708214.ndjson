{"summary": "tanshinones are the major liposoluble constituents of Tanshen. they consist of abietane type-diterpene quinone pigments. the primary bioactive constituents among the tanshinones are tanshinone I (TNI), tanshinone IIA (TNIIA), and cryptotanshinone (CPT) tanshinones have been investigated for the treatment of cardio-cerebrovascular diseases, such as myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and stroke. bioavailability of tanshinones. regulated cAMP response element-binding protein (TORC1) and upregulated expression of phosphorylated (pCREB), TORC1 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor. 60 mg STS in combination with 300 mg aspirin can significantly attenuate angina pectoris attacks. potential mechanisms involved include upregulation of pro-apoptosis proteins such as p53, Bax, p21, etc. TNIIA, TNI, and CPT have synergistic anticancer effects with chemotherapeutic drugs such as cisplatin, doxorubicin, 5-flurouracid, and arsenic trioxide. the clinical use of TIIA for cancer treatment has been reported in a patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia. NF-B-inducing kinase/IkappaB alpha kinase (NIK/IKKalpha), ERK1/2, p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways. TNI significantly inhibited the activity of group IIA secretory phospholipase A2 (GIIA) to thereby block prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) formation in LPS- 62 TNI inhibited peroxynitrite-induced DNA damage by diminishing the 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide-hydroxyl (DMPO-OH) radical adduct signal from peroxynitrite. it has been shown that TNIIA, TNI, and CPT have obvious inhibitory effects on osteoclast differentiation. TNIIA, TNI, and CPT were found to be specific and selective inhibitors for the SARS-CoV cysteine proteases 3CLpro and PLpro. however, TNIIA could inhibit tat-induced HIV-1 transactivation through redox-regulated AMPK/NAMPT pathway. TNIIA, TNI, and CPT are potent cytotoxic agents that significantly inhibit the growth and survival of multiple types of cancer cells by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis with IC50 at the micromolar level. the potential mechanisms involved include the upregulation of pro-apoptosis proteins such as p53, Bax, p21, etc. NIIA and TNI are able to inhibit the migration, invasion, and metastasis of cancer cells through the alteration of matrix metalloproteinases. TNIIA can also promote cell differentiation in several cancer cell types likely by regulating CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) beta and C/EBP homologous protein 10.39\u201341. TNIIA suppresses LPS-induced nuclear factor kappaB activation through the inhibition of the NF-B-inducing kinase/IkappaB alpha kinase (NIK/IKKalpha), ERK1/2, p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways. TNI significantly inhibited the activity of group IIA secretory phospholipase A TNI activated the NF-E2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-dependent antioxidant response by preventing ubiquitination-mediated Nrf2 degradation. it inhibited peroxynitrite-induced DNA damage by diminishing the 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide-hydroxyl (DMPO-OH) radical adduct signal from peroxynitrite. tanshinones such as TNIIA, TNI, and CPT are efficacious pregnane X receptor agonists that induce CYP3A4 expression. TNIIA, TNI, and CPT were found to be specific and selective inhibitors for the SARS-CoV cysteine proteases 3CLpro and PLpro. however, TNIIA could inhibit tat-induced HIV-1 transactivation through redox-regulated AMPK these agents have been attributed to their low levels of biological utilization;81,82 these preparations include solid dispersion and solid lipid NPs. Table 1 shows the various drug delivery systems of tanshinones Drug delivery systems. Poloxamer 407 TNIIA, TNI or CPT Nano-silica, pluronic F68 TNIIA Polyvinylpyrrolidonoe K30, pluronic F68 TNIIA Nanoparticles Poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide acid) TNIIA, SB, and PNS Sustained release of drugs and long circulation time in the human body with excellent pharmacological activities No targeted delivery system with better cell up liposomes were used to encapsulate glycyrrhetinic acid (GA), salvianolic acid B (SB) and TNIIA, enhancing the bioavailability and water solubility of the compounds. subsequently, the encapsulation efficiency of these drugs was >80% with little difference among the individual compounds. however, a challenge exists in controlling the ratio of different drugs to produce an improved healing efficacy. lipid emulsions,88 microemulsions,89 and nanoemulsions90 of soybean phospholipid, pluronic F68 (F68), glycerol, oleic acid, lecithin, and so on were used to produce TNIIA formulations with long-term stability. however, nanoemulsions have proved to have higher bioaccessibility, stability, and optical clarity than conventional emulsions. a tanshinone microemulsion showed potent cytotoxicity with 103.4-fold greater than TNIIA alone against human bladder cancer cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. it was also reported that a tanshinone microemulsion possessed cytotoxic effects on the human leukemia cell line K562/ADM,95. a method of establishing the high performance liquid chromatography fingerprints of tanshinone microemulsions has been solid dispersions are a technique for improving the dissolution rate and bioavailability of poorly water-soluble drugs by dispersing them into solid-state hydrophilic carriers with an increased surface area. solid dispersions of TNIIA, TNI, and CPT have been applied to improve the dissolution, stability, and bioavailability of poorly water-soluble drugs. ternary solid dispersions that were composed of F68, nano-CaCO3 and TNIIA showed high dissolution rates and stability. despite the benefits of solid dispersions, it is necessary to obtain long-lived circulation within the human body. entrapment efficiency of 95.49%, a drug loading of 2.03%, and drug recovery rate of 38.42%. another type of material, PLA, was used to prepare novel NPs of TNIIA (TNIIA-PLA-NPs) by a single oil-in-water emulsion/solvent evaporation method. the resulting particles had a significant dose- and time-dependent growth-inhibitory effect on hepatomas with sustained polymeric NPs of TNIIA have greater bioavailability as well as water solubility and a long circulation time in the human body with excellent pharmacological effects. however, neither formulations had a targeted delivery system for the improved cellular uptake of TNIIA. liposomes were used to encapsulate glycyrrhetinic acid (GA), salvianolic acid B (SB) and TNIIA. the compounds exerted synergistic effects on the inhibition of hepatic stellate cell proliferation. a challenge exists in controlling the ratio of different drugs to produce an improved healing efficacy. 91,92 nanoemulsions are similar to microemulsions that are monodispersed spherical droplets with thermodynamic stability as well as excellent solubility properties. a tanshinone microemulsion with a mean droplet size of 32.256.59 nm was prepared to improve the bioavailability in rat small intestine. tanshinone microemulsions have excellent long-term stability and anticancer activity. however, it is not convenient enough to prepare the emulsions with more than four types of materials. inclusion complexes of TNIIA or TNI and CDs were obtained via coprecipitation and lyophilization to enhance the level of biological utilization. solid dispersions of TNIIA, TNI, and CPT have been applied to improve the dissolution rate and bioavailability of poorly water-soluble drugs. there are various types of carriers being used to prepare solid dispersions of TNIIA via the solvent technique or spray-drying method. ternary solid dispersions that were composed of F68, nano-CaCO3 and TNIIA demonstrated high dissolution rates and stability. despite the benefits of solid dispersions, it is necessary to obtain long-lived circulation within the human body and greater efficacy against cancer. the resulting particles had a significant dose- and time-dependent growth-inhibitory effect on hepatomas with sustained release in vitro and in vivo. despite the enhanced bioavailability and water solubility of the NPs, it is more efficient to modify the NPs to obtain an extended circulation within the human body. pellets113 and micelles114 have also been used to enhance the solubility and stability of TNIIA. neither of these formulations had a targeted delivery system for the improved cellular uptake of TNIIA. sensitivity of TNIIA in future research may be driven by lack of information. tanshinones can make a breakthrough and better therapy in the future."}
