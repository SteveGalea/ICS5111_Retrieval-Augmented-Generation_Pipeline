{"summary": "the science of networks has revolutionised research into the dynamics of interacting elements. epidemiology has embraced the potential of network theory more than any other discipline. there is an extremely close relationship between epidemiology and network theory. a comprehensive review of all work is impossible. instead, we provide a personalised overview into the areas of network epidemiology that have seen the greatest progress in recent years. a range of other network-based processes (such as the spread of ideas or panic) can be modelled in a similar manner to the spread of infection; however, in these contexts, the transmission process is far less clear. d) time-varying infection-specific matrix (T i,j(t) = f pathogen(G i,j(t)) allows us to define the stochastic dynamics of the infection process for a given pathogen. the reality of transmission networks is far from this ideal. a related methodology is respondent-driven sampling, where individuals are paid both for their participation and the participation of their contacts while protecting each individual's anonymity. this approach, while suitable for hidden and hard to reach populations, has a number of limitations, both practical and theoretical: recruiting people into the study, getting them to disclose such highly personal information. several pioneering studies were performed on a network of 40 individuals. participants were tested for STIs, and the distribution of infection compared to the underlying network structure. no attempt was made to use these networks predictively in simulations. a new approach to gathering social network and behavioural data was initiated by the human Dynamics group at MIT. in 2004, 100 Nokia 6600 smart-phones preinstalled with software were given to MIT students to use over the course of the 2004-2005 academic year. in this work, 46 Tasmanian devils were fitted with proximity loggers that could detect and record the presence of other loggers within a 30 cm range. a variety of methods have been developed to generate synthetic networks from known attributes. egocentric data generally consists of information on a number of individuals (the egos) and their contacts (the alters) the data exists as multiple independent \u201cstars\u201d linking the egos to the alters. if more information is available on the status (age, gender, etc.) of the egos then this can also be included. if more information is available on the status (age, gender, etc.) of the egos and alters then this can also be included. if more information is available on the status (age, gender, etc.) of the egos then this can be included. transmission of an STI (such as gonorrhoea and chlamydia [25] or HIV [26] was then simulated upon this dynamic network. increasing concurrency substantially increased the growth rate during the early phase of an epidemic. this greater growth rate was related to the increase in giant component size. the models of both Longini and Ferguson are primarily agent-based models. they separate the entire population into subunits of 2000 individuals (for the USA) or 13000 individuals (for South-East Asia) who constitute the local population where random transmission can operate. in principle, both of these models could be used to generate an explicit network model of possible contacts. the stochastic simulation models of the Longini group have predominantly focused on methods of controlling smallpox. their early work utilised networks of two thousand people with realistic age, household size, and school attendance distributions. the likelihood of each individual becoming infected is derived from the number and type of contacts with infectious individuals. the models based on the USA and Great Britain considered a wider range of control measures, including school closures, household prophylaxis using antiviral drugs, and vaccination. the models predicted the likely impact of different policies. the movement of passenger aircraft as collated by the international air transport association (IATA) provides very useful information about the long-distance movement of individuals and hence how rapidly infection is likely to travel around the globe. the work by Hufnagel et al. [37] and Colizza et al. [45] focused on the spread of SARS. a wide variety of movements are not made by aircraft but are regular commuter movements to and from work. the network of such movements has also been studied in some detail for both the UK and the USA [39, 40, 51] this scheme generates daily networks of contacts between over 30,000 working farms in Great Britain [42, 53\u201356]. similar data exist for the movement of batches of sheep and pigs. this data source has several key advantages over other movement networks. model was the number of infectious individuals moved between connected farms in each time step. green et al. simulated early spread of FMD through movement of cattle, sheep, and pigs. an alternative form of contact-tracing is when a transmission pathway is sought between all identified cases [1, 60, 61]. this form of contact-tracing is likely to become of ever-increasing importance in the future when improved molecular techniques allow infection trees to be determined from genetic differences between samples of the infecting pathogen [62]. the network of friendships and contacts on social networking sites (such as Facebook) some sites have made data on their social networks available. some sites have made data on their social networks available. these networks mimic the strong interactions within families and the entire population. lattice networks and small world networks offer a step towards reality. they capture the local nature of transmission and the potential for long-range contacts. but they suffer from neglecting heterogeneity in the number of contacts. ERGMs are widely used by statisticians and social network analysts. despite significant advances in recent years, ERGMs still suffer from problems of degeneracy and computational intractability. there are three fundamental problems in the study of networks: heterogeneity in the number of contacts such that some individuals are at a higher risk of both catching and transmitting infection, clustering of contacts such that groups of individuals are often highly interconnected, and some reflection of spatial separation such that contacts usually form locally, but occasional long-range connections do occur. the ideal network would be derived from an omniscient knowledge of individual behaviour. any particular infectious disease can be represented as a function (f pathogen) translating this high-dimensional variable into an instantaneous probabilistic transmission rate (a single real variable) the disease function picks out (and combines) those elements of G that are relevant for transmission of this pathogen. realised Encounter Networks One of the few examples of where many of the potential transmission routes within a population have been documented comes from the spread of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) STIs have very obvious transmission routes\u2014sex acts (or sharing needles during intravenous drug use) each individual has a prescribed degree distribution, which gives rise to \u201chalf-links\u201d that are connected at random. the small-world property is given by the presence of rare random links that can connect distant parts of the network. several pioneering studies were performed. despite these difficulties, these sexual contact networks provide an invaluable source of information on human sexual networks. they point to the extreme levels of heterogeneity in the number of sexual contacts over a given period. the variance in the number of contacts has been shown to play a significant role in early transmission dynamics. a more recent study into the encounters between wild Tasmanian devils in the Narawntapu National Park in northern Tasmania utilised a similar technological approach. 46 devils were fitted with proximity loggers that could detect and record the presence of other loggers within a 30 cm range. as such, these loggers could provide detailed temporal information on the potential interaction between these 46 animals. two major studies have attempted to gather such egocentric information. the key to generating a network from such data is to probabilistically assign each alter a set of contacts drawn from the information available from egos. if more information is available on the status (age, gender, etc.) of the egos and alters then this can also be included. the POLYMOD matrices have therefore been extensively used in the study of the H1N1 pandemic in 2009. the general configuration model approach of randomly linking together \u201chalf-links\u201d from each ego has been adopted and modified to consider the spread of STIs. simulations have been used to consider the importance of concurrency in sexual networks. the model was later used to consider the importance of different structural measures and sampling strategies. the alternative approach of simulating the behaviour of individuals is obviously highly complex and fraught with a great deal of uncertainty. the network is considered as a static contact network in which extreme heterogeneity in numbers of contacts is again predicted, and the network has \u201csmall world\u201d like properties. a similar approach of generating artificial networks of individuals for stochastic simulations of respiratory disease has been recently applied to influenza at the scale of the u.s. the Ferguson models have primarily been used to consider the spread and control of pandemic influenza. the models of south-east Asia were primarily based on Thailand. they included demographic information and satellite-based spatial measures of population density. such a strategy could require a stockpile of around 3 million antiviral doses. the earliest work using detailed movement data to drive simulations comes from the spread of 1918 pandemic influenza in the Canadian Subarctic, based on records kept by the Hudson's Bay Company. work focused on the spread of SARS and showed a remarkable degree of similarity between predictions and the global spread of this disease. the work of Colizza was more focused on the spread of H5N1 pandemic influenza arising in South-East Asia. but again, the IATA flight data provided a useful prediction of the early spread. the commuter network can be thought of as heterogeneous, locally clustered, temporal, and with each contact having different strengths. however, to provide a complete description of population movement, and hence disease transmission requires other causes of movement to be included. the key question that can be readily addressed from these commuter-movement models is whether a localised outbreak can be contained within a region. Kiss et al. [57] conducted short simulated outbreaks of FMD on the sheep movement network based on 4 weeks' movements starting on 8 September 2004. the aim being to model spread of FMD before it had been detected, nodes were susceptible, exposed or infected but never recovered. contacts are generally traced and treated so rapidly that they are unlikely to have generated secondary cases. contact tracing is likely to become of ever-increasing importance in the future. the network is often accompanied by test results for individuals within the network. 2.6. Surrogate networks Obtaining large-scale and reliable information on who contacts whom is obviously very difficult; therefore, there is a temptation to rely on alternative data sets. networks are not directly relevant for the spread of infection, but they do provide insights into how networks form and grow. a range of theoretical results can be proved ranging from conditions for invasion [18, 67, 68] to descriptions of the temporal dynamics [69]. a compromise between tractability and realism occurs when individuals that exist in fully interconnected cliques have randomly assigned links within the entire population. small world networks improve upon the rigid structure of the lattice by allowing a low number of random contacts across the entire space. such long range contacts allow infection to spread rapidly though the population and vastly reduce the shortest path length between individuals [74] small world networks offer a step towards reality, capturing the local nature of transmission and the potential for long-range contacts. ERGMs are widely used by statisticians and social network analysts. despite significant advances in recent years, ERGMs still suffer from problems of degeneracy and computational intractability. small world networks improve upon rigid structure of lattice by allowing a low number of random contacts across the entire space. small world networks suffer from neglecting heterogeneity in the number of contacts and the tight clustering of contacts within households. ERGMs are widely used by statisticians and social network analysts. despite significant advances in recent years, ERGMs still suffer from problems of degeneracy and computational intractability for large network sizes. a wide variety of network structures have been measured or synthesised to understand the spread of infectious diseases. there is no clear consensus on the types of underlying network structures that are generally present; in part, this is because different studies have focused on different infectious diseases. but three fundamental problems still exist in the study of networks. researchers have defined a large variety of measurable properties that can be used to characterise certain key aspects. a network is said to have a giant component if a single component contains the majority of nodes in the network. members of the strongly connected component are most at risk from infection imported at a random node. the degree distribution is defined as the set of probabilities, P(k) that a node chosen at random will have degree k. the degree distribution is defined as the set of probability that a node chosen at random will have degree k. in real-transmission networks, degree is often heavily skewed, and occasionally follows a power law [22], but is always bounded, leading to the recovery of epidemic threshold. the distribution of degree is often heavily skewed, and occasionally follows a power law [22], but is always bounded. nodes of high degree tend to link to nodes with low degree [63, 89]. characterising degree correlations is important for understanding disease spread. the classic example is the existence of strong correlations in sexual networks. the notion of shortest distance through a network can be used to quantify how central a given node is in the network. betweenness centrality captures the idea that the more shortest paths pass through a node, the more central it is in the network. central nodes are likely to become infected early on in the epidemic, and are also key targets for intervention. clustering properties of networks are essential to understanding transmission processes. rapid local depletion of susceptible individuals plays a hugely important role in the dynamics of spread. subgraphs Degree and clustering characterise some aspects of network structure at an individual level. a subgraph is defined as a subgraph in which each node has more edges to other nodes within the subgraph than to any other nodes in the network. the most commonly used definition of communities is groups of nodes that have a high density of edges within them. the modularity measure compares the expected number of edges within communities to the actual number of edges within communities. more work has been done on weighted networks, as they are a more straightforward extension of the classical presence-absence networks. a network is said to have a giant component if a single component contains the majority of nodes in the network. the component to which a node belongs is that set of nodes that can be reached from that node. strongly connected component contains nodes that can be reached from each other. members of strongly connected component are most at risk from infection imported at a random node. degree distribution is defined as the set of probabilities, P(k) that a node chosen at random will have degree k. degree distribution is one of the most important ways of characterising a network. the higher the number of edges a node has, the more likely it is to be a neighbour of an already infected node. knowing the form of P(k) is crucial for the understanding of the spread of disease. degree of the neighbours of a node k n n, i = 1 k i j Nbr s i k j, (2) where the sum of degrees is made over the neighbours of i. one can then calculate the average of k nn over all nodes with degree k. the network is said to be assortative on the degree; that is, high-degree nodes tend to link to other high degree nodes. the diameter of the network is defined as the maximum shortest path distance between a pair of nodes in the network, max(d i,j), which measures the most extreme separation of any two nodes in the network. the vast majority of nodes are reachable in a small number of steps. this has clear implications for disease spread and its control. the factor of three accounts for the fact that each triangle is found in three triples and guarantees that 0 1 (and its inclusion depends on the way that triangles in the network are counted) the clustering property of networks is essential to the understanding of transmission processes. n-cliques relax the above constraint while retaining its basic premise. the shortest path between all the nodes in a clique is one. n-cliques are defined as a subgroup containing more than two nodes. newman and Girvan formalised this in terms of the modularity measure Q [99]. the modularity measure compares the expected number of edges within communities to the actual number of edges within communities. a few studies have shown it can have a profound impact on disease dynamics. discrete-time and continuous-time models are more common. discrete-time simulations are more common, so we discuss them first. in a dynamic network simulation, the network is typically updated every time step. alternative approach to simulating disease processes on networks is to simulate a series of stochastic Markovian events. it is possible to calculate probability distributions of when possible subsequent events will occur. the continuous-time approach is clearly in closer agreement with the ideal of standard disease models. 4.2. Analytic Methods In this section, we use the word \"analytic\" broadly, to imply models that are directly numerically integrable, without the use of Monte Carlo simulation methods. there are approaches that calculate exact invasion thresholds and final sizes for special networks. there are approaches for calculating exact transient dynamics. in the case where the population is connected on a random graph, q is reduced to as N is increased to hold n constant. in either case, a stochastic susceptible-infectious model of transmission is defined through a markov chain. the exact mean behaviour of such a system in the limit N then has its transmission behaviour captured by S = S ( t ) I ( t ), (8) where S, I are the proportion of individuals susceptible and infectious, respectively. threshold for invasion is given by the basic reproductive ratio R 0, defined as the expected number of secondary infectious cases created by an average primary infectious case in an otherwise wholly susceptible population. if the mean infectious period is T, then the basic reproductive ratio is R 0 = T. p defines the number of cases in individuals with k contacts from an individual with m contacts during the early stages of the epidemic. p is the probability of infection eventually passing across the edge between a susceptible-infectious pair (for Markovian recovery rate and transmission rate this is given by p = /( + )) a general feature of clustered networks for which exact thresholds have been derived so far is that there is a local-global distinction in transmission routes. the most sophisticated and general way to obtain exact results for the expected final size of a major outbreak on a network is called the susceptibility set argument. exact Dynamics Some of the earliest work on infectious diseases involved the exact solution of master equations. the presence of symmetries in the network, however, does mean that automorphism-driven lumping is one way to manipulate the master equations for solution. S k, I k are the proportion of effective degree k susceptible and infectious individuals, respectively. calculation of the asymptotic early growth rate r requires systems of ODEs like (14) the network is composed of m communities of size n 1,..., n m, with the between-community (global) mixing determined by a Poisson process with rate n G and the within-community (local) mixing determined by a Poisson process with rate n L. in the limit as the communities become large, n i, the epidemic dynamics on the system are S a = S a ( L I a + b a I b ), I a the metapopulation model (16) and the small cliques model (18) are reasonably numerically tractable for modern computational resources. the basic reproduction number for the first system is clearly R 0 = 1 ( L + ( m 1 ) while for the second, household model, invasion is determined by R = n G + Z n ( (20) where Z n(, ) is the expected final size of an epidemic in a household of size n with one initial infected. a large class of models exists that form a bridge between \u201cmean-field\u201d models and simulation by using spatial or network moment closure equations. in general, invasion thresholds and final sizes can be calculated rigorously, but exact calculation of transient dynamics is only possible for very special networks. moment closure is the only versatile way of calculating desired quantities without relying on full numerical simulation. we use square brackets to represent the prevalence of different species within the network. we also use nonstandard notation to present several diverse approaches in a unified framework. ij a ij, A ij Number of nodes Size of network N n, S Number of edges Graph size L e, l Centrality C Degree Connectivity k d, C d Betweenness B i beti, C b Degree distribution Connectivity distribution P(k) P(k) P k,p k Shortest path distance Geodesic distance D i,j d i,j Clustering transitivity c, Number of nodes n n is again the average degree distribution and measures the ratio of triangles to triples as a means of capturing clustering within the network. the typical way to analyse the closed system is direct numerical integration; however, some analytic traction can be gained. house and Keeling considered a model of infection transmission and contact tracing on a network, where the closure scheme for [ABC] triples was asymmetric in A and C. this allowed the natural conservation of quantities in a highly clustered system. the precise link between this PGF formulation and the pairwise approach is discussed more fully in House and Keeling [134]. Sharkey et al. [135] considered closure at triple level on directed networks. it is also possible to combine stochastic and network moment closure. a very recent work [142] presents a dynamical system to capture epidemic dynamics on triangular configuration model networks. this diversity of approaches leads to some important points about methods based on moment closure. these methods are extremely general and can be applied to almost any aspect of network structure or disease natural history. deterministic limit can be made arbitrarily small by running additional simulations. the second source of deviation is the network size. each approximate model is designed with a different application in mind. eous pairwise model of Eames and Keeling [96], ClustPW is the improved clustered pairwise closure of House and Keeling [133], PGF is the model of Volz [129], Pair-based is the model of Sharkey [139], integrated using the supplementary code from Sharkey [143], and Degree-based is the model of Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani [87]. in this case, models that incorporate heterogeneity like HomP a one-dimensional next-nearest-neighbour lattice introduces long path lengths between nodes in addition to clustering. the system does not converge onto a period of asymptotic early growth. the pair-based curve captures the qualitative behaviour of an epidemic. in a directed network with N nodes, there are N(N 1) possible edges. in a sparse network with mean node degree k, there are Nk N(N 1) edges. the alternative approach to simulating disease processes on networks is to simulate a series of stochastic Markovian events. Discrete-time models may provide a viable alternative for three main reasons. inaccuracies due to the discrete-time formulation are likely to be less substantial in network models compared to random-mixing models. analytic approaches to transmission of infection on networks fall into three broad categories. a population of N individuals has a homogeneous independent probability q that any pair of individuals is linked on the network. we then assume that the transmission rate for infection across an edge is and that the proportion of the population infectious at a time t is I(t) the force of infection experienced by an average susceptible in the population is n I ( t ) I ( t ). the quantity defines a population-level transmission rate that can be interpreted in one of two ways as N. the existence of waning immunity, a latent period between an individual becoming infected and being able to transmit infection, and nonexponentially distributed recovery periods are also important for epidemiological applications [10, 42, 115]. a latent period between an individual becoming infected and being able to transmit infection is also important for epidemiological applications. values of R 0 can be measured directly during the course of an epidemic. however, there are considerable statistical issues concerning censoring and data quality. a threshold called R can be defined by considering the number of secondary cliques infected by a clique with one initial infected individual. the calculation of the invasion threshold involves calculating both the expected number of secondary infectious individuals and triangles rather than just working at the individual level. a two-step process is needed because in an unclustered graph two generations of infection are needed to stabilise the network correlations. so the auxiliary variable S must also be solved for. the expected attack rate is R = 1 S. an exact system of equations for SIR dynamics in the limit of large network size was provided by Ball and Neal [69] this construction involves attributing to each node an \u201ceffective degree\u201d which starts the epidemic at its actual degree. this measures connections still available as routes of infection and is reduced by transmission and recovery. transmission and recovery are Markovian processes with rates and, respectively, two measures of early behaviour are R 0 CM = n ( n 1 ) n +, r CM = n ( n 2 ) n. these quantities tell us that the susceptibility to invasion of a network increases with both the mean and the variance of the degree distribution. for more structured networks with a local-global distinction, there are two limits in which exact dynamics can also be derived. the metapopulation model (16) and the small cliques model (18) are reasonably numerically tractable for modern computational resources. the basic reproduction number for the first system is clearly R 0 = 1 ( n - 1 ) while for the second, household model, invasion. a large class of models exists that form a bridge between \u201cmean-field\u201d models and simulation by using spatial or network moment closure equations. a large class of models exists that form a bridge between \u201cmean-field\u201d models and simulation by using spatial or network moment closure equations. in general, invasion thresholds and final sizes can be calculated rigorously. the idea of moment closure is to start with an exact but unclosed set of equations for the time evolution of different units of structure. such pairwise moment closure model are a natural extension to the standard (random-mixing) models. generalised indices represent any property of a node (such as its degree), while arrows represent the direction of infection (and so for a directed network, the necessity that an edge in the appropriate direction be present) we also use nonstandard notation to present several diverse approaches in a unified framework. the triple closure is symmetric with respect to the direction of infection. the network is assumed to be static and nondirected. the typical way to analyse the closed system is direct numerical integration. [131] use a closure where [ S O O ] n 1 n [ S O ] [ O ] [ O ] [ O ] [ O ] [ O ] [ O ] [ O ] [ O ] [ O ] [ O ] [ O ] [ O ] [ O ] [ O ] [ O ] [ O ] [ O ] [ O ] [ O ] [ O ] [ O ] [ O ] [ the closure assumption is implicit in the definition of S. an individual only remains susceptible if all of its links have not seen the transmission of infection. it is also possible to combine stochastic and network moment closure. the transmission rate takes the polynomial form Transmission rate to S k from I l k l ( S k ) p ( I l ) q, (25) where the exponents are typically fitted to simulated data but are thought to capture the spatial arrangement of susceptible and infected nodes. a very recent work [142] presents a dynamical system to capture epidemic dynamics on triangular configuration model networks. values of R 0 can be measured through a next-generation matrix K k m = [ k m ] ( m 1 ) m [ m ] p (10) where K km defines the number of cases in individuals with k contacts from an individual with m contacts during the early stages of the epidemic. a threshold called R can be defined by considering the number of secondary cliques infected by a clique with one initial infected individual. the calculation involves calculating both the expected number of secondary infectious individuals and triangles rather than just working at the individual level. a two-step process is needed because in an unclustered graph two generations of infection are needed to stabilise the network correlations. so the auxiliary variable S must also be solved for. the expected attack rate is R = 1 S. 4.2.3. exact systems of equations of lower dimensionality can be derived for special networks. for static networks constructed using the configuration model, an exact system of equations for SIR dynamics was provided by Ball and Neal [69] this construction involves attributing to each node an \u201ceffective degree\u201d which starts the epidemic at its actual degree. totic early growth rate r requires systems of ODEs like (14) r 0 CM = n ( n 1 ) n +, r CM = n ( n 2 ) n, (15) where informs about the average over the degree distribution. the susceptibility to invasion of a network increases with both the mean and the variance of the degree distribution. the metapopulation model (16) and the small cliques model (18) are reasonably numerically tractable for modern computational resources. the basic reproduction number for the first system is clearly R 0 = 1 ( n - 1 ) a large class of models exists that form a bridge between \u201cmean-field\u201d models and simulation by using spatial or network moment closure equations. in general, invasion thresholds and final sizes can be calculated rigorously, but exact calculation of transient dynamics is only possible for very special networks. the dynamical PGF approach is numerically indistinguishable from exact results and simulation. the idea of moment closure is to start with an exact but unclosed set of equations for the time evolution of different units of structure. such pairwise moment closure model are a natural extension to the standard (random-mixing) models. we use square brackets to represent the prevalence of different species within the network. we also use nonstandard notation to present several diverse approaches in a unified framework. generalised indices, represent any property of a node (such as its degree), while arrows represent the direction of infection (and so for a directed network, the necessity that an edge in the appropriate direction be present) the triple closure is symmetric with respect to the direction of infection. the network is assumed to be static and nondirected. n n measures the ratio of triangles to triples as a means of capturing clustering. the work on dynamical PGF models can be seen as an elegant simplification of this pairwise approach that is valid for SIR-type infection dynamics on configuration model networks. the equations can be reformulated as S = g ( ), I = p I g \u2032 ( ) I, p I = p S p I g \u2032\u2032 ( ) g \u2032 ( ) p I, p S = p S p I, p S = p S the closure assumption is implicit in the definition of S. an individual only remains susceptible if all of its links have not seen the transmission of infection. it is possible to combine stochastic and network moment closure. the transmission rate takes the polynomial form Transmission rate to S k from I l k l ( S k ) p ( I l ) q, (25) where the exponents, p and q, are typically fitted to simulated data but are thought to capture the spatial arrangement of susceptible and infected nodes. al et al. and Lindquist et al. [124] and. Lindquist et al. [130] have several issues with attempts to compare deterministic models with simulation. first, it is necessary to define what is meant by agreement between a smooth, deterministic epidemic curve and the rough trajectories produced by simulation. constant-time simulations have temporal origin shifted so that they agree on the time at which a cumulative incidence of 200 is reached. confidence intervals in the mean prevalence of infection are achieved through bootstrapping. six different deterministic models are compared to simulations. in reality the ratio of the rate of network change to the rate of transmision may not be either large or small. in reality the ratio of the rate of network change to the rate of transmision may not be either large or small. in reality the ratio of the rate of network change to the rate of transmision may not be either large or small. the presence of contact network data for populations provides a unique opportunity to estimate the importance of various modes of disease transmission from disease incidence or contact tracing data. if data on mere connectivity is available, it is still possible to infer a rate of infection between connected individuals. this is determined to a large extent by the available detail in the network data. in a heterogeneous population, the behaviour of an epidemic within any particular locality is governed by the relationship between infected and susceptible individuals. contact tracing data may be used to infer the network. if the network is completely unknown, it would be useful if estimation of both the epidemic parameters and parameters specifying the structure of the network was possible. an example of inference for R 0 based upon complete epidemic data is provided by Stegeman et al. [154], where data from the 2003 outbreak of high pathogenicity Avian Influenza H7N7 is fitted to a chain-binomial model using a generalised linear model. this is particularly relevant for real time estimation of R 0. a population wide R 0 gives a measure of whether an epidemic is under control on a wide-scale, but give no indication as to regional-level, or even individual-level risk. it is postulated that a simple measure of R 0, although simple to obtain, is not sufficient in order to make tactical control-policy decisions. in these situations, knowledge of both the transmission rate and removal rate are required. two important extensions to this framework are to incorporate different levels of risk factors for individuals [161] and to introduce dependence of p H on an infectious period [162]. these types of methods are largely based upon the ability to generate closed form formulae for the final size distribution of the models. children play a key role in the transmission of influenza and the risk of bringing infection into the household. the majority of methods are based on final size data and are developed for SIR disease models. intuition would suggest that in larger households the mixing between any two individuals is decreased. inference from contact tracing In livestock diseases, part of the standard response to a case detection is to gather contact tracing information from the farmer. the resulting data are a list of contacts that have been made in and out of the infected farm during a stipulated period prior to the notification of disease. this shows a high degree of similarity to spatial kernel estimates based on the statistical techniques of Diggle [178] and Kypraios [179] without using contact tracing information. recent unpublished work has shown promise in assimilating imperfect contact tracing data and case detection times to greatly improve inference. the MCMC algorithm was improved by Neal and Roberts [181] and the extension from SIR to SEIR has been developed by Groendyke et al. [182]. however, the extension to more realistic families of networks remains a challenging problem. the early growth of an epidemic is known to be subexponential due to the depletion of the local susceptible population. contact tracing data may be used to infer the network. if the network is completely unknown, it would be useful if estimation of both the epidemic parameters and parameters specifying the structure of the network was possible. however, with appropriate assumptions, some results can be obtained. data from the 2003 outbreak of high pathogenicity Avian Influenza H7N7 is fitted to a chain-binomial model using a generalised linear model. this is particularly relevant for real time estimation of R 0. For example, Cauchemez et al. attempt to estimate R 0 in real-time by constructing a discrete-time statistical model that imputes the number of secondary cases generated by each primary case. a simple measure of R 0, although simple to obtain, is not sufficient in order to make tactical control-policy decisions. in these situations, knowledge of both the transmission rate and removal rate are required. for nonhomogeneous models, the definitions are not equivalent. 155 attempts to estimate R 0 in real-time by constructing a discrete-time statistical model that imputes the number of secondary cases generated by each primary case. this is based on the method of Wallinga and Teunis [156] who formulate a likelihood function for inferring who infected whom from dates of symptom onset L ( i infected j ) = w ( t j t i ) j k w ( t inference on household models is well developed in comparison to inference for other \u201cnetwork\u201d models. this is for three main reasons: first, it is a reasonable initial approximation to assume that infection either occurs within the home or from a random source in the population. second, entire households can be serologically sampled following an epidemic. methods are largely based upon the ability to generate closed form formulae for the final size distribution of the models. the ability to relax assumptions further has been predominately due to use of markov chain Monte Carlo methods. this methodology has been used to in combination with simulation and data augmentation approaches. Bayesian inference on stochastic mechanistic models using MCMC have perhaps shown the most promise, allowing inference to be made on both transmission parameters and infectious period. analysis of 1861 outbreak of measles in Hagelloch by Neal and Roberts [166] demonstrates the use of a reversible jump MCMC algorithm to infer disease transmission parameters and infectious period. an analysis of the 1861 outbreak of measles in Hagelloch by Neal and Roberts [166] demonstrates the use of a reversible jump MCMC algorithm to infer disease transmission parameters and infectious period. this approach has since been combined with the algorithm of O'Neill and Roberts [165] and used to analyse disease outbreaks. use of contact tracing data in inferring epidemic dynamics does not appear to have been well exploited. this assumed that the source of infection was correctly identified by the field investigators, giving an empirical estimate of the probability of infection as a function of distance. however, recent unpublished work has shown promise in assimilating imperfect contact tracing data and case detection times. all the stochastic models for generating networks described in Section 2.7 above realise a distribution over all or some of the 2N(N1)/2 possible networks. in most cases, this distribution is not tractable; MCMC techniques are in principle still possible but in practice would be too slow without careful design of algorithms. MCMC techniques are still possible but in practice would be too slow without careful design of algorithms. but with appropriate assumptions some results can be obtained, which provide some insight into what more could be achieved. there is now a growing set of diary-based studies that have attempted to record the personal contacts of a large number of individuals. the configuration method of randomly connecting half-links provides one potential solution, but what is ideally required is a more comprehensive method that would allow clustering, spatially localised connections and assortativity between degree distributions. to date the vast majority of the work into disease transmission on networks has focused on static networks where all links are of equal strength. however, it is clear that contact networks change over time (both on the short-time scale of who we meet each day, and on the longer time-scale of who our main work and social contacts are) open questions Several open problems remain if networks are to influence predictive epidemiology. the majority stem from the difficulty in obtaining realistic transmission networks for a range of pathogens. a more comprehensive method would allow clustering, spatially localised connections and assortativity between degree distributions to be included and specified. this would allow for different networks (from different times or different locations) to be compared in a manner that is epidemiologically significant and would allow artificial networks to be created that matched particular known network features. a more immediate challenge is to understand ways in which local network structure (clustering, cliques, and spatially localised connections) influence the epidemiological dynamics. data gathering resources are almost always limited. therefore, carefully designed randomised sampling schemata should be employed to maximise the power of the statistical techniques used to analyse data. this aspect is particularly important when working on network data derived from population samples."}
