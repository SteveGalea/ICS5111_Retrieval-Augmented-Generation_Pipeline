{"summary": "the total economic damage caused by WSD to the shrimp aquaculture industry has been estimated at $8\u2013$15 billion since its emergence. annual losses have traditionally equated to approximately one tenth of global shrimp production [11], increasing by $1 billion annually. despite growing knowledge base, cost-effective vaccinations and/or treatments remain elusive. white calcified spots appearing on the exoskeleton are diagnostic of WSD in some [19] but not all host species. WSSV infection occurs in all tissues of mesodermal and ectodermal origin. infected nuclei become hypertrophied with marginalized chromatin. eosinophilic inclusion usually expands to fill the nucleus (*) nuclei then disintegrate so that the content fuses with the cytoplasm (black arrow) 98 potential host species for WSSV have been identified. WSSV can be transmitted through the consumption of infected tissue, by cannibalism/predation, and via exposure to water containing WSSV virions. a comparison between Asian tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon) and whiteleg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) has shown that overall transmission rates are similar in these species. a number of review articles have been published detailing the interactions between viruses and the host innate immune system. this is fundamental for advancing our understanding of the WSD infection process and exploring potential opportunities for disease treatment and prevention. WSSV Genome WSSV contains a circular dsDNA genome of 300 kb in size. a region of approximately 750 bp shows variation between WSSV-TH and WSSV-TW. a region of approximately 750 bp shows variation between WSSV-TH and WSSV-TW. WSSV-TH shows 100% homology with a known transposable element. VNTRs occur in open reading frames (ORF), e.g., ORF75, ORF94 and ORF125 in WSSV-TH. smaller variations like single nucleotide polymorphisms and short insertions/deletions are found. microarrays constructed based on 184 putative ORFs of WSSV-TH confirmed expression of 79% of these ORFs in the gills of P. monodon infected with WSSV. interesting features of WSSV ORFs include one exceptionally long ORF. only around 30% of the ORFs in the WSSV genome contain a polyadenylation signal. miRNAs, WSSV Infection, and pathogenesis have been documented to be widely expressed in animal and plant species. miRNAs have key regulatory roles in a number of cellular pathways, including early development, cell differentiation and proliferation, apoptosis, signal transduction, and immunity. miRNAs encoded in a virus genome may also function to induce gene expression. a miRNA found to be upregulated in WSSV-infected M. japonicus, miR-7, was predicted to target the 3\u2032-untranslated region of wsv477. a miRNA found to be upregulated in WSSV-infected M. japonicus, miR-7, was predicted to target the 3\u2032-untranslated region of wsv477. WSSV miRNAs promote WSSV infection through regulating expression of WSSV genes. wsv094 and wsv177 (WSSV-miR-66) and wsv248 and wsv309 (WSSV-miR-68) are related to latency. a region of approximately 750 bp shows variation between WSSV-TH and WSSV-TW. a region of approximately 750 bp shows variation between WSSV-TH and WSSV-TW. a region of approximately 750 bp shows variation between WSSV-TH and WSSV-TW. the effects of genetic variation on WSSV virulence and fitness have been investigated in a number of studies. putative ORFs in the WSSV genome have been determined for every isolate. these ORFs are present on both strands (54% forward and 46% reverse [16,50] long ORF is the longest among all viruses, specifically wssv_03600. only around 30% of the ORFs in the WSSV genome contain a polyadenylation signal. translation from these polycistronic mRNAs is likely to be facilitated by internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) miRNAs encoded in a virus genome may regulate either viral or host genes to manipulate immune responses and cellular functions for the benefit of the virus. viruses may regulate and use host miRNAs to facilitate their own replication or to regulate the virus life cycle. wsv477 is an early gene that is involved in viral gene replication. its inhibition would thus have negative effects on WSSV replication. WSSV was shown to have the capacity to encode 40 distinct miRNAs. two WSSV miRNAs, wsv094 and wsv177 (WSSV-miR-66) and wsv248 and wsv309 (WSSV-miR-68), promote WSSV infection through regulating expression of WSSV genes. a model for the WSSV life cycle and morphogenesis was suggested by Escobedo-Bonilla and colleagues. a high level of viral protein production can lead to ER stress, e.g., activation of unfolded protein response pathways. WSSV replication requires essential nutrients including iron. to prevent the host from withholding iron, WSSV can inhibit the binding of iron to Ferritin. viral protein Species Reference VP24, VP32, VP39B, VP41A, VP51B, VP51B, VP51B, VP51B, VP51B, VP53A, VP53B, VP60A, VP110, VP124, VP337 Chitin-binding protein (PmCBP) Penaeus monodon [89,90] VP53A Glut1 P. monodon us [101] VP466 Rab (PjRab) P. japonicus [102] VP28 Rab7 (PmRab7) P. monodon [103] ORF514 PCNA (lvPCNA) L. vannamei [104] Wsv083 FAK (MjFAK) M. japonicus [106] AAP1 (WSSV449) Caspase (PmCaspase) P. monodon [107 integrins are heterodimeric surface receptors that recognize Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motifs in target proteins. the viral proteins VP26, VP31, VP37, VP90 and VP136 also interact with the integrin receptors of L. vannamei. bioinformatics analyses have predicted that multiple proteins are involved in the recognition and binding of host integrins. lectins (C-type lectins) have been demonstrated to interact with WSSV proteins. a lectin (FcLec3) has been identified that can interact with VP28. a lectin (FcLec3) has been identified that can interact with VP28. interactions with other lectins in M. japonicus indicate a contradictory relationship between WSSV and lectins. a C-type lectin isolated from the stomach of M. japonicus (MjsvCL) has been shown to interact with VP28 [96] but, in contrast to other lectins, MjsvCL appears to facilitate WSSV infection. WSSV can enter hemocytes of L. vannamei in primary culture through caveolar endocytosis. the evidence included inhibition of WSSV uptake under MCD and lack of effect of chlorpromazine. in crayfish hematopoietic tissue, it appears to be the Clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway that is responsible for viral uptake. early endosomes \u201cmature\u201d in a process that includes several changes to the organelles including lumen acidification, their movement toward the perinuclear region, and changes in membrane lipid/protein composition. escape from the endosomes can occur either through membrane fusion or lysis/leakage of the endosomal compartments. dsRNA-mediated silencing of lvRab7 has also been shown to reduce mortality rates, albeit a mild reduction. it is unclear how the interaction between VP28 and Rab7 is mediated as the proteins are separated by the endosomal membrane. it is possible that this interaction occurs after WSSV has been released from the endosomes. a greater knowledge of this pathway for WSSV is likely to help identify targets for drug development for disease prevention. a list of known interactions between host proteins and viral genes is provided in Table 2. a list of known interactions between host proteins and viral genes is provided. immediate early genes expressed upon WSSV infection have been identified in infected hemocytes via the use of a protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide (CHX) a total of 16 ORFs have been identified including WSV069 (IE1), WSV051, WSV100, WSV079 with transactivation activity, and WSV083 with ser/Thr kinase domain. ie1 promoter contains an initiator element, TATA-box, and a binding site for the transcription factor Sp1. STAT (PmSTAT) can increase the activity of the ie1 promoter through a STAT-binding motif. STAT is part of the JAK-STAT anti-viral signaling pathway in L. vannamei. WSSV449 activates the host NF-B pathway and promotes expression of viral genes. MAP kinase c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) also has an ability to bind the ie1 promoter. transcription factor binding has yet to be validated experimentally. recombinant factor from P. monodon (rPmKLF) could bind to the KLF element. a deletion in this element had the largest impact on expression through the WSSV108 promoter. genes can be grouped according to their function and they comprise of at least three classes. early phase genes target replication of the viral genome. the authors deduced that although WSSV carries some DNA replication machinery, it still relies on host factors. processivity is the ability to catalyze consecutive reactions without releasing the substrate. the average number of nucleotides added per DNA association event has been shown to be low [157] viruses have evolved mechanisms to reduce the ability of viruses to replicate. the cell might enter apoptosis, preventing further viral replication by undergoing self-destruction. some of these interactions have been investigated for WSSV infections. iron In addition to energy, WSSV and other invading pathogens also require essential nutrients including iron. dsRNA-mediated knockdown of ferritin resulted in a three-fold increase in viral copy number. ation and apoptosis have adverse effects on viral replication. viruses have evolved mechanisms through which the host UPR response can be manipulated. interactions between viruses and these UPR pathways are complex. some viruses inhibit responses whereas others induce them. wsv023, wsv049, wsv064, wsv069, wsv138, wsv242, wsv256, wsv282, wsv303, wsv306, wsv313, wsv321, wsv343, wsv406, and wsv453) in l. vannamei the UPR transcription factor LvATF4 (as apoptosis is an important defense mechanism against abnormalities in cell programming and disease infection, including viruses. viruses can influence the host apoptosis system by either inhibiting or inducing it. in later stages of viral infection, some viruses might induce apoptosis. activation of effector caspases leads to an accelerated feedback loop of effector caspase activation. direct inhibition of the activity of a P. monodon effector caspase by the WSSV protein anti-apoptosis protein 1 (AAP1 or WSSV449) has been shown in Sf9 cells. WSSV249 has been shown to be involved in ubiquitination by acting as an E3-ligase. the RING-H2 domain of WSSV222 enables it to perform as an E3-ligase in the ubiquitination of tumor suppressor-like protein, thereby inhibiting apoptosis. the success of ubiquitination of pro-apoptotic proteins will determine the fate of the host cell. a third virus\u2013host interaction could influence the apoptotic state of the host cell. the crystal structure of dimers of ICP11 indicates that it could act as a DNA mimic. in eukaryotes, DNA is compacted in nucleosomes but this does not occur in viruses. a small (6.7 kDa) viral protein, VP15, has been associated with WSSV DNA packaging. VP15 can form homomultimers and condensates resemble packaged viral DNA. the WSSV envelope requires long chain fatty acids (LCFA) during the early stages of infection fatty acids are depleted in order to generate the energy required for viral replication. during the late stage of infection LCFAs are upregulated, thus replenishing the LCFA that have been used. there is little information available on how assembled WSSV virions are released from the host cell. penaeus monodon [89,90] VP53A Glut1 P. monodon [91] VP15, VP26, VP28 gC1qR (PlgC1qR) Pacifastacus leniusculus [92] VP95, VP28, VP26, VP24, VP19, VP14 C-type lectin (LvCTL1) Litopenaeus vannamei [93] VP28 wsv083 FAK (MjFAK) M. japonicus [106] AAP1 (WSSV449) Caspase (PmCaspase) P. monodon [108] WSSV249 Ubc (PvUbc) L. vannamei [109] ICP11 Histones P. monodon [110] VP9 RACK1 (PmRACK1) P. monodon [111] VP15 FKBP46 viral proteins VP26, VP31, VP37, VP90 and VP136 also interact with integrin receptors of L. vannamei. VP26 is a tegument protein that associates with a protein complex involving VP24, VP28, VP38A, VP51A, and WSV010 in the viral envelope. interactions of viral protein complex with PmCBP and with VP53A appear to be facilitated by glucose transporter1 (Glut1) [91] the innate immune system of the host employs groups of proteins that are able to recognize and bind pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP) molecules. one family of proteins that recognize non-self molecules are the lectins. a lectin isolated from the stomach of M. japonicus (MjsvCL) has been shown to interact with VP28. inhibition of its expression by RNAi results in lower virus replication. exogenous MjsvCL thus works as a bridge between the virus and the calreticulin receptor. odextrin (MCD, an inhibitor of caveolar endocytosis) treatment and a lack of effect of chlorpromazine (CPZ, an inhibitor of Clathrin-mediated endocytosis) in crayfish hematopoietic tissue, CPZ significantly inhibited WSSV internalization. escape from the endosomes can occur either through membrane fusion or lysis/leakage of the endosomal compartments. an important class of regulatory proteins in endocytosis are the small Rab GTPases. Rab GTPases are key regulators of endocytosis. lvRab7 silencing of both viral ribonucleotide reductase small subunit (rr2) and host Rab7 resulted in a 95% survival of infected animals compared with 100% mortality in animals treated with WSSV only [132,133]. it is unclear how the interaction between VP28 and Rab7 is mediated as the proteins are separated by the endosomal membrane. WSSV does not carry its own transcriptional machinery, it relies initially on the host to supply these genes. so-called \u201clate genes\u201d are expressed after initiation of viral DNA synthesis. immediate early genes expressed upon WSSV infection have been identified in infected hemocytes via the use of a protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide (CHX). inhibiting protein synthesis disables the ability of WSSV to create its own transcription factors and thus relies solely on host factors. STAT (PmSTAT) can increase the activity of the ie1 promoter through a STAT-binding motif. a cytokine receptor activates the JAK-STAT pathway in L. vannamei. a homologue of NF-B, LvRelish, can bind to the ie1 promoter. WSSV IE1 protein (a viral transcription factor) is then able to facilitate expression of viral early genes. the MAP kinase c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) also has an ability to bind the ie1 promoter, implicating involvement of MAP kinase signaling. a deletion in this element had the largest impact on expression through the WSSV108 promoter [143,146,153] the action of these transcription factors result in a higher expression level of the WSSV108 promoter than ie1 [143,146,153]. early phase genes target replication of the viral genome and include DNA polymerases, DNA helicases, and genes involved in nucleic acid metabolism. viral proteins in Drosophila S2 cells resulted in an increased portion of S-phase cells and a correlated decrease in G0/G1-phase cells. authors propose that WSSV utilizes the DNA replication machinery present in host cells during S-phase and promotes S-phase arrest to support successful replication of the viral genome. viruses have evolved mechanisms to reduce the ability of viruses to replicate. the cell might enter apoptosis, preventing further viral replication by undergoing self-destruction. some of these interactions have been investigated for WSSV infections. WSSV protein kinase 1 (WSSV PK1) can interact with host ferritin. higher amounts of ferritin resulted in greater binding of iron. dsRNA knockdown of ferritin resulted in a three-fold increase in viral copy number. interactions between viruses and these UPR pathways are complex. some viruses inhibit responses whereas others induce them. wsv083 has been shown to inhibit focal adhesion kinase. wsv069, wsv069, wsv138, wsv242, wsv256, wsv282, wsv303, wsv306, wsv313, wsv321, and wsv453) in l. vannamei the UPR transcription factor LvATF4 (as for LvXBP1) also upregulates expression of wsv023. apoptosis is an important defense mechanism against abnormalities in cell programming and disease infection, including viruses. viruses can influence the host apoptosis system by either inhibiting or inducing it. in later stages of viral infection, some viruses might induce apoptosis. s leads to an accelerated feedback loop of effector caspase activation. s leads to an accelerated feedback loop of effector caspase activation. WSSV proteins show interactions with shrimp caspases. WSSV249 is involved in ubiquitination by acting as an E3-ligase. the RING-H2 domain of WSSV222 enables it to perform as an E3-ligase in the ubiquitination of tumor suppressor-like protein, thereby inhibiting apoptosis. the success of ubiquitination of pro-apoptotic proteins will determine the fate of the host cell. a third virus\u2013host interaction could influence the apoptotic state of the host cell, involving the highly expressed WSSV protein ICP11. the crystal structure of dimers of ICP11 indicates that it could act as a DNA mimic. it was shown that ICP11 could interfere with the binding of host DNA to histones (H3) in HeLa cells [110]. a small (6.7 kDa) viral protein, VP15, has been associated with WSSV DNA packaging. VP15 is a basic protein that shows homology to putative baculovirus DNA-binding proteins. VP15 can form homomultimers and is able to bind to (preferably supercoiled) DNA. LCFAs are depleted in order to generate energy required for viral replication. but during the late stage of infection LCFAs are upregulated, thus replenishing the LCFA that have been used. there is little information available on how assembled WSSV virions are subsequently released from the host cell. dsRNA-mediated knockdown of ferritin reduced susceptibility to WSSV infection. dsRNA-mediated knockdown of ferritin resulted in a three-fold increase in viral copy number. dsRNA-mediated knockdown of ferritin resulted in a three-fold increase in viral copy number. ed RNA-activated Protein kinase-like ER kinase and Activating Transcription Factor 4 (PERK-ATF4) induce ER kinase and Activating Transcription Factor 6 (ATF6) interactions between viruses and these UPR pathways are complex. some viruses inhibit responses whereas others induce them. wsv303, wsv306, wsv313, wsv321, wsv343, wsv406, and wsv453. the shutdown of translation following UPR activation is achieved through phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor subunit eIF2 [179]. viruses can influence the host apoptosis system by either inhibiting or inducing it. some viruses may induce apoptosis as a means of leaving cells and spreading further throughout the host. apoptosis has been documented to occur in L. vannamei, P. monodon, and M. japonicus cells infected with WSSV. inhibition of a P. monodon effector caspase by WSSV protein anti-apoptosis protein 1 (AAP1 or WSSV449) has been shown in Sf9 cells. a different method of host caspase regulation has been revealed in M. japonicus. WSSV249 is involved in ubiquitination by acting as an E3-ligase. the RING-H2 domain of WSSV222 enables it to perform as an E3-ligase in the ubiquitination of tumor suppressor-like protein. the success of ubiquitination of pro-apoptotic proteins will determine the fate of the host cell. dimers of VP9 (ICP11) could act as a DNA mimic. crystal structure of dimers indicates that it could interfere with binding of host DNA to histones (H3) in dsDNA phosphate groups. a small (6.7 kDa) viral protein, VP15, has been associated with WSSV DNA packaging. VP15 is a basic protein that shows homology to putative baculovirus DNA-binding proteins. VP15 can form homomultimers and is able to bind to (preferably supercoiled) DNA. LCFA inhibited the replenishment of LCFA was shown to result in impaired virion formation. there is little information available on how assembled WSSV virions are released from the host cell. despite the large body of work, our understanding of WSSV infection and pathogenesis are far from complete. new generation technologies are attempting to provide more efficient delivery systems for these treatments. baculovirus and Bacillus subtilis spores, both modified to express VP28, could convey protection via oral vaccination. RNAi can potentially play a significant role in host\u2013pathogen interactions. large screens with extracts from plants have been carried out in an attempt to identify chemicals with anti-WSSV properties. extracts from the seaweed Sagrassum weighti have been shown to have a significant effect in reducing WSSV infection in both the Indian prawn (P. indicus) and freshwater crab (Paratelphusa hydrodomous) research on WSSV infection has been complicated by lack of well-annotated genomic resources for host species. there has been a reliance placed on sequence similarities with other species to provide required annotation. current research on WSSV infection has focused overwhelmingly on susceptible shrimp species. a potential avenue for exploration in combating WSD relates to resistance that has developed in certain hosts through integration of viral DNA into the host genome. if such a mechanism of resistance could be transferred from resistant to susceptible shrimp species, this could result in the production of shrimp lines that are resistant to WSSV. the practical implementation of this knowledge will require the resulting treatments to be cheap, easy to use and easily distributed."}
