{"summary": "glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues. it involves the oxidation of glucose-6-phosphate to 6-phosphogluconolactone. this then produces a reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate. redox status influences micro-environment in cells, which in turn affects physiological functions. NOXs are a family of proteins, including NOX1, NOX2, NOX3, NOX4, NOX5, Duox1 and Duox2. inflammatory response is also a powerful weapon for the host to be able to fight against pathogen infections. the down-regulation of COX-2 and subsequent decline of PGE2 impair antiviral response in G6PD-kd A549 cells upon TNF- treatment. we have provided evidence that G6PD plays an important role in activating NOX/MAPK/NF-B/COX-2 cascade. anti-phospho-p38 MAPK (#9211), anti-phospho-ERK1/2 MAPK (#4377), anti-phospho IB (#2859) and anti-phospho p65 (#3031) antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA, USA) cell cultures and TNF- treatment Human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD, USA) lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 12, 000 rpm for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. mixture consisted of 25 g of protein in 1 ml of assay buffer (4 mM NADP+, 50 mM MgCl2, 50 mM Tris\u2013HCl (pH 8.0) and 4 mM glucose 6-phosphate.

Results G6PD knockdown diminishes the replication level of coronavirus through regulation of COX-2/PGE2 upon TNF- stimulation. the expression level of COX-2 protein upon 15 ng/ml TNF- treatment was determined by the luciferase assay. the expression level of COX-2 protein upon 15 ng/ml TNF- treatment was shown, and -actin was present as the loading control. data are reported as the means SD, n = 3. *p0.05. decreased COX-2 expression makes airway epithelial cells susceptible to viral infection. phosphorylation levels of MAPKs signaling are decreased in G6PD-kd cells upon TNF- treatment TNF- induces MAPKs activation in human airway epithelial cells. the inhibition of the MAPKs pathway can impair TNF--induced COX-2 expression. the phosphorylation level of p38 (C), ERK1/2 (D) were determined by western blot in scramble control and G6PD-kd A549 cells stimulated with 1.5 or 15 ng/ml TNF- in different time courses. numbers represent relative fold differences of protein levels on the basis of densitometer quantitation. expression level of COX-2 was assessed by western blotting assay. numbers represent relative fold differences of protein levels on the basis of densitometer quantitation. phosphorylation levels of p65 and IB were investigated in scramble control and G6PD-kd A549 cells upon TNF- treatment (15 ng/ml) in different time courses. numbers represent relative fold differences of protein levels on the basis of densitometer quantitation. NOX is involved in the activation of p38 MAPK phosphorylation and COX-2 expression. the expression level of COX-2 was determined under 15 ng/ml TNF- stimulation for 3 h in universal negative control (NC) or NOX2-targeting siRNA transfected scramble control and G6PD-kd A549 cells. the expression level of NOX subunits was determined by western blot in scramble control and G6PD-kd A549 cells. results suggest that G6PD modulated NOX activity by providing a substrate for NOX and affecting the expression of NOX subunits. coronavirus (0.1 MOI) for 8 h upon universal negative control (NC) or NOX2-targeting siRNA pretreatment. infected cells were harvested for analyzing viral mRNA expression. G6PD knockdown diminishes the replication level of coronavirus. Fig 1.

Interestingly, G6PD knockdown impairs NF-B signaling triggered by NOX activity in the present report. a low dose of TNF- causes cellular ROS production through the activation of NOX and downstream signaling (MAPK/NF-B) the activated NOX/MAPK/c-JUN/NF-B signaling is concomitant with the increased expression of COX-2 and production of PGE2. COX-2 expression and PGE2 production are also less in G6PD-knockdown cells. the phosphorylation level of p38 was determined in scramble control (Upper) and G6PD-kd A549 cells (Lower) upon different dosages of TNF- stimulation combined with or without pre-treatment of DPI for 10 min."}
