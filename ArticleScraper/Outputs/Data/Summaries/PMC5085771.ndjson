{"summary": "emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are globally emerging and re-emerging with increased frequency. many potential emerging viruses of concern might already be infecting humans or wildlife but await their detection by disease surveillance. Xenosurveillance and vector-enabled metagenomics (VEM) are surveillance approaches that can exploit mosquitoes to capture the viral diversity of the animal, human or plant host the mosquito has fed on. Xenosurveillance refers to the identification of viral pathogens from total nucleic acids extracted from mosquito blood meals. mosquito-borne viruses infect mosquitoes naturally and replicate in mosquito cells in vitro, but do not replicate in vertebrate cells or infect humans or other vertebrates. most studies on mosquito viruses focus on mosquito-infecting viruses. 3.6% of all viruses found in the metagenomics survey were neither mosquito-infecting nor mosquito-borne, but assumed to be of vertebrate origin. mosquitoes are not known to be vectors of torque teno sus virus 1 and porcine parvovirus. papillomaviruses can infect epithelia lining oral mucosa, conjunctiva, cornea and skin. 80% of healthy human skin is asymptomatically infected with different papillomaviruses. it is possible that both papillomaviruses and herpesvirus have been transferred from the human skin to the mosquito during feeding. viremia titers derived from these two methods were not significantly different. the technique has also been successfully used on small reptiles before, but was not compared to standard methods. anopheles stephensi mosquitoes were fed with dengue virus-infected blood. the efficiency of recovering viral RNA was analyzed after serial time points by qRT-PCR and NGS. results showed viral dengue RNA in the blood meal is gradually degraded but still detectable 24 h after blood feeding. midges Biting midges (Diptera, Ceratopogonidae, Culicoides Latreille), small blood-sucking flies, have been found in almost all parts of the world in all environments. they transmit various culicoides-borne arboviruses, e.g., Schmallenberg virus in European ruminants, Bluetongue virus, Oropouche virus and African horse sickness virus. carrion flies have been used for the targeted detection of mammalian species DNA and biodiversity. bed bugs are wingless, obligate hematophagous ectoparasites and feed on bats, birds and mammals. to our knowledge, there are no virome analyses of bed bugs. the medicinal leech (Hirudo medicinalis) is able to take up to 15 mL of blood from its host. 90% of all leeches feed solely on decomposing bodies and open wounds of amphibians, reptiles, waterfowl, fish and mammals. zoonotic transmission of viruses from lice has been reported, but VEM has been shown successfully for human body lice (Pediculus humanus corporis) engorged in vitro with artificially infected human blood. both DNA and RNA viruses are still detectable in mosquito blood meal at least 24 h after ingestion. viral nucleic acids can be detected from blood-fed Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes for up to 24 h post feeding. RNA virus recovery from mosquitoes fed on membrane feeding apparatus did not differ significantly. Ticks Ticks (class Arachnida, subclass Acari) are a source of many highly pathogenic vector-borne diseases such as crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV). some tick species feed slowly for days and concentrate their blood meals by excreting water and sodium ions. carrion flies (Calliphora nigribarbis and Aldrichina grahami) sampled near poultry farms have been used for the detection of H5N1 virus. other examples of mechanically transmitted viruses by flies are the transmission of turkey coronavirus and rotavirus by domestic houseflies. bugs are wingless, obligate hematophagous ectoparasites and feed on bats, birds and mammals. human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can be detected for eight days after ingestion of concentrated virus in experimental blood meals. leech (Hirudo medicinalis) is able to take up to 15 mL of blood from its host. RNA and DNA viruses (bovine parvovirus, feline calicivirus, equine arteritis virus and equine herpesvirus type 1) absorbed by terrestrial leeches were shown to remain infectious within the leech for up to six months. 90% of all leeches feed solely on decomposing bodies and open wounds of amphibians, rep some tick species feed slowly for days on their host and concentrate their blood meals by excreting water and sodium ions. metagenomic analysis of Rhipicephalus spp. ticks from china revealed the presence of a virus belonging to the Anelloviridae that was closely related to torque teno canis virus. carrion flies (Calliphora nigribarbis and Aldrichina grahami) sampled near poultry farms have been used for the detection of H5N1 virus. also, Newcastle disease virus has been detected in carrion flies and correlated to a virus outbreak in a poultry farm nearby. hematophagous insects are known to transmit feline leukemia virus and myxoma virus. there are no virome or metagenomic analyses on fleas. there are no studies on bat fly viruses or bat metagenomics. 90% of all leeches feed solely on decomposing bodies and open wounds of amphibians, reptiles, waterfowl, fish and mammals. most species of terrestrial leeches live in tropical rainforests of Asia, Madagascar and Australia, areas with sparse human population. 83.7% of all mosquitoes in the study were feeding on one host species exclusively. human, dog and pig as the most common hosts. iDNA can be used to link viruses identified in mosquitoes and other blood-feeding arthropods. mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles are abundant in all geographic emerging disease \u201chotspots\u201d specified by Jones et al. for the surveillance of human viruses with VEM, anopheles quadrimaculatus mosquitoes can be collected from human dwellings. the average blood meal volume of mosquitoes is 2 L (1 L of serum). blood meals dried on FTA cards can be maintained at room temperature for weeks prior to NGS. the denaturation and inactivation of viral particles is provided for. VEM was performed successfully in the field, and sequences of human and animal viruses were detected. the detection of a canine virus from a mosquito blood meal by using VEM was linked to the detection of canine host DNA [9], a term for the genetic material ingested by invertebrates feeding on vertebrates. most viruses identified in the viromes of mosquito blood meals were described as \u201cnovel\u201d (70% amino acid identity) these findings suggest that the viral diversity in mosquitoes and in virus reservoirs has hardly been explored yet. more than 320,000 viruses still await their discovery. pathogens prior to disease outbreak and future epidemics."}
