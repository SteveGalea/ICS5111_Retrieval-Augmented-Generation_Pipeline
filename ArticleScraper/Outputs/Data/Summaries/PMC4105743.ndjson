{"summary": "tRNAs, ribosomal RNAs, self-splicing introns, RNaseP-RNA, or riboswitches adopt intricate three-dimensional globular structures rivaling or even surpassing protein structures in their complexity. many of these structures share smaller three-dimensional RNA folding motifs or submotifs as common structural building blocks. ribosomal RNAs, including hammerhead ribozyme, snRNAs and viral RNA elements. U-turn motifs share 3-nt consensus sequence 5\u2032-UNR-3\u2032. the change in the direction of the RNA backbone occurs at the phosphate group 3\u2032 from the U residue of the consensus sequence. neomycin sensing riboswitch is a synthetic gene regulatory element developed by a combined in vivo and in vivo selection procedure for the translational control of gene expression in response to the aminoglycoside neomycin in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. the riboswitch adopts a hairpin-like secondary structure and is able to bind its ligand neomycin with an affinity in the low nanomolar the hairpin-like secondary structure of the neomycin riboswitch is capped by a strongly conserved hexaloop. the sequence 5\u2032-U13U14U15A16A17U18-3\u2032 adopts a well-defined and rigid structure. the first and the last nucleotide of the hexaloop U13 and U18 form an asymmetric cis Watson-Crick/Watson-Crick U:U base pair structural and functional characteristics of the neomycin riboswitch and its U14C mutant are shown in a 3D structure. ligand ribostamycin is shown in stick representation, and residues forming the U-turn are indicated in red. gene assay in S. cerevisiae in the presence of neomycin (black bars) or in the absence of ligand (white bars) a replacement of U14 by a C residue also results in functional riboswitches. such a mutation should interfere with proper folding and the stability of the U-turn motif because C lacks an imino proton. cytidine amino groups are able to form highly stable hydrogen bonds with the phosphate backbone but did not discuss evidence for interactions between protonated cytosine bases and phosphate groups. cytidine amino groups are able to form highly stable hydrogen bonds with the phosphate backbone but did not discuss evidence for interactions between protonated cytosine bases and phosphate groups. cytidine is able to functionally replace the uridine in the neomycin riboswitch. the riboswitch represses gfp expression 8.6-fold in the presence of 100 M neomycin in the medium, whereas only a threefold reduction of gfp expression is achieved. the affinity of the mutant is only slightly diminished in comparison to the WT riboswitch, which binds neomycin with a KD of 9.2 nM (Weigand et al. 2011). this already suggests that the structure of the ligand binding pocket of the riboswitch is not strongly altered by the mutation in the U-turn motif of its apical loop. the only obvious difference between the two spectra is the absence of the signal corresponding to the U14 imino group at 10.87 ppm. closer inspection of the U14C-mutant spectrum reveals a novel imino proton signal with a chemical shift of 12.83 ppm at 10\u00b0C. similar chemical shift values are normally observed for guanine imino protons in Watson-Crick base pairs. RNA selectively labeled with 13C,15N-cytidine shows that the imino proton is connected to a cytidine N3 with a nitrogen chemical shift of 144.4 ppm. the 1JHN scalar coupling constant measured for the imino group in C+:C base pairs in the i-motif in DNA is considerably smaller (45 Hz), since there the proton is delocalized in the N+H...N hydrogen bond 8.5 ppm were reported for the amino protons. amino nitrogen chemical shifts for protonated cytidines reported previously were larger than 111.0 ppm. a projection is shown along the hydrogen dimension of the long-range HSQC. a 3D structure of the U-turn motif containing a protonated cytidine at the first position is shown as an inset. a modeled 3D structure of the U-turn motif containing a protonated cytidine is shown as an inset. a 2D 1H,31P-long-range HSQC spectrum reveals a direct correlation between the C14 H3 imino proton and this 31P resonance. this is due to the presence of a small scalar coupling between these spins. this correlation was previously observed for the WT RNA-ribostamycin complex. previous studies have established that the chemical shifts of both the nitrogen (Wang et al. 1991) and those of the carbon nuclei are excellent reporters of their protonation state. the protonation at N3 significantly affects the other chemical shifts associated with C14, in particular those of the hetero-atoms. the N3 nitrogen chemical shift of C14 (144.4 ppm) is also clearly separated from the bulk of the cytidine N3 resonances (195\u2013200 ppm) and is in similar chemical shift range as observed for protonated cytidines in base triples (142.7 ppm, 138.4 ppm) stabilizing structurally related pseudoknots (Nixon et al. 2002b; Cornish et al. 2005, 2006) pKa shifts due to involvement of the protonated residue in the formation of stable RNA secondary and tertiary structures are not unprecedented. the hydrogen bond between the protonated cytidine and the phosphate backbone is very stable. exchange rates in Hz are plotted as a function of temperature. cross- (red) and reference (black) spectrum of a quantitative 1D 31P1H spin-echo experiment for the U14C mutant with an evolution delay of 40 msec at 22\u00b0C. the water exchange rates for the U14 H3 proton in the WT riboswitch-ribostamycin complex and the C14 H3 proton of the mutant complex were recorded as a function of temperature. the hydrogen bond involving the imino group of the protonated C14 is only slightly less stable than the canonical U-turn hydrogen bond involving the U14 imino group in the WT. the replacement of uridine by a protonated cytidine also occurs in other U-turn motifs. we analyzed all X-ray structures of RNAs and RNPs with a nominal resolution better than 2.5 present in the pdb. the 23S rRNA of the thermophilic archaeon Thermococcus celer is most likely another example for a U-turn structure with a protonated C instead of the U at the first position of its consensus sequence. the same loop contains the canonical U-turn sequence 5\u2032-UAACU-3\u2032, while Escherichia coli 23S rRNA contains a stable GNRA tetraloop at this position. the long-range interaction depicted in atomic detail in C is indicated by a red line. potential hydrogen bonds of the uridine U1321 imino proton and the amino groups of C1320 and C1322 to the acceptor backbone phosphates are indicated by dashed red lines. a protonated cytidine (C+) can replace the uridine at the first position of the classical U-turn motif by forming a very stable hydrogen bond with the negatively charged phosphate backbone in the neomycin riboswitch. the possibility of replacing the U with a protonated cytidine residue in U-turn structures would help explain mutational data for other functional RNAs. a cytidine is able to functionally replace the uridine in the U-turn of the neomycin riboswitch. the mutant binds to neomycin in vitro with a KD of 24.2 nM. the affinity of the mutant is only slightly diminished in comparison to the WT riboswitch, which binds neomycin with a KD of 9.2 nM. the ligand ribostamycin binds to the riboswitch with the same binding mode as neomycin. however, due to the absence of ring IV in ribostamycin, there is reduced signal overlap in some regions of the NMR spectra. this suggests that the three-dimensional structure of the U13 and U18 imino protons closely resemble the WT. closer inspection of the U14C-mutant spectrum reveals a novel imino proton signal with a chemical shift of 12.83 ppm at 10\u00b0C. similar chemical shift values are normally observed for guanine imino protons in Watson-Crick base pairs. imino protons of protonated cytidines in base triples have chemical shifts larger than 14.5 ppm. scalar coupling constants observed in guanosine and uridine imino groups. the 1JHN scalar coupling measured for the imino group in C+:C base pairs in the i-motif in DNA is considerably smaller (45 Hz) since there the proton is delocalized in the N+H...N hydrogen bond. 1D-imino region of 1H,15N-HSQC spectra with and without 15N-decoupling in direct dimension recorded with selectively 15N-cytidine-labeled U14C-riboswitch-ribostamycin complex. the 1JHN coupling constant is indicated. a modeled 3D structure of the U-turn motif containing a protonated cytidine at the first position is shown as an inset. hydrogen bonds observed as cross peaks in the 1H,31P-long-range HSQC are indicated by dashed lines in the structure. the donor and acceptor groups are colored according to atom type. a 2D 1H,31P-long-range HSQC spectrum reveals a direct correlation between the C14 H3 imino proton and this 31P resonance. thereby, this experiment directly demonstrates the existence of a hydrogen bond between the N3H3 imino group of the protonated C14 and the backbone phosphate 3\u2032 from A16. this hydrogen bond conforms exactly to the U-turn consensus structure. the protonation at N3 significantly affects the other chemical shifts associated with C14, in particular those of the hetero-atoms. the most pronounced effects are observed for the chemical shifts of the C4 and C2 carbon nuclei, in particular those of the hetero-atoms. at pH 8.2, we observe virtually the same C4 and C2 chemical shifts for C14 as at pH 6.2 (Supplemental Fig. 4A,B) however, such strong pKa shifts due to involvement of the protonated residue in the formation of stable RNA secondary and tertiary structures are not unprecedented. imino proton 1D-1H NMR- and 1D-1H,15N-HSQC spectra were recorded using the selectively cytidine-labeled sample at different temperatures and pH values. the imino proton signal is still detectable at 35\u00b0C and at pH 6.2 (Fig. 3A,B; Supplemental Fig. 5A) at 25\u00b0C. the 3\u2032 phosphate groups of U8, A16, and A17 (labeled U8, A16, and A17) are involved in hydrogen-bonding interactions. signal intensity ratios between a coupled cross (Icross) and a de-coupled reference experiment (Iref) are plotted against the duration of the evolution delay. the apparent 2hJHP-scalar coupling constant is similar in size to the 2hJHP-coupling constant involving the U14 imino proton in the WT RNA. the apparent 2hJHP-scalar coupling between the 2\u2032-OH proton of A16 and the A17 phosphate group in the WT RNA is slightly smaller (1.8 Hz) short cytidine N3-phosphate group oxygen distance (2.6) found in high-resolution X-ray structure of large ribosomal subunit from the archaeon Haloarcula marismortui. it is observed between nt C1469 and the phosphate group 3\u2032 from nt A1471, which are both located in a 5\u2032-C1469AACU-3\u2032 pentaloop closed by a G-C base pair. the 23S rRNA contains a stable GNRA tetraloop at this position in the rRNA. potential hydrogen bonds are indicated by dashed red lines. distances between donor nitrogen and acceptor oxygen are given. potential hydrogen bonds of the uridine U1321 imino proton and the amino groups of C1320 and C1322 to the acceptor backbone phosphates are indicated by dashed red lines. the long-range interaction shown in detail in E is indicated by a red line. a protonated cytidine (C+) can replace the uridine at the first position of the classical U-turn motif by forming a very stable hydrogen bond with the negatively charged phosphate backbone in the neomycin riboswitch. the possibility of replacing the U with a protonated cytidine residue in U-turn structures would also help explain mutational data for other functional RNAs. the gene regulatory activity of the neomycin riboswitch and the U14C mutant in response to neomycin was tested by an in vivo gene reporter gene assay. samples were synthesized by in vitro transcription with T7 RNA-polymerase and linearized plasmid-DNA as a template. imino resonances of the free riboswitch were verified by the disappearance of imino resonances of the free riboswitch in the 1D-1H spectra. the majority of NMR resonance assignments for the U14C mutant could be transferred from the WT RNA (Duchardt-Ferner et al. 2010; Schmidtke et al. 2010). the assignments for the C2 resonances of the nonprotonated cytidines were derived from an 2D-H6(C6N1)C2 experiment (F\u00fcrtig et al. 2004) all NMR data were processed with TOPSPIN2.1 (Bruker Biospin) the gene regulatory activity of the neomycin riboswitch and the U14C mutant in response to neomycin was tested by an in vivo gene reporter gene assay in S. cerevisiae. samples were synthesized by in vitro transcription with the sequence 5\u2032-GGCUGCUUGUCUCCUAAGGUCCAGUC-3\u2032. samples were titrated with 1.2 equivalents of commercially available ribostamycin. saturation of the RNA with ribostamycin was verified by disappearance of imino resonances of the free riboswitch in the 1D-1H spectra. the majority of NMR resonance assignments for the mutant could be transferred from the WT RNA. ytidine C4 resonances were obtained from a 2D-H6(C6N1)C2 experiment. all NMR data were processed with TOPSPIN2.1 (Bruker Biospin) distances between the nitrogen and oxygen atoms were measured. all distances smaller than 3.0 were stored as putative hydrogen bonds."}
