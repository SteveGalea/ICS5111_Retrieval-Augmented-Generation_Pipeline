{"summary": "there are 12 CEACAMs found in humans: CEACAM1, CEACAM3\u2013CEACAM8, CEACAM16 and CEACAM18\u2013CEACAM21. functions and roles in cellular processes are diverse and include roles in phagocytosis, hearing, proliferation, signaling, tumor suppression and cell adhesion. -terminal immunoglobulin variable domain (IgV), a variable number of immunoglobulin constant domains (IgC2) and either a C-terminal transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain or a glycophos\u00adphatidyl-inositol (GPI) moiety. cell adhesion is achieved through the N-terminal domain of CEACAMs, which can undergo heterodimerization and homodimerization in we report the 1.47 resolution X-ray crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of CEACAM7. CEACAM7 was synthesized as a codon-optimized GeneArt string. it was digested into an NcoI/XhoI-cut pET-21d vector without a purification tag. inclusion bodies were dissolved in 30 mM Tris\u2013HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 8.0 M urea pH 8.3 (5 ml per litre of grown cells), refolded by rapid dilution (1:12 ratio) into 50 mM CHES\u2013HCl, 500 mM l-arginine pH 9.2 and left for 24 h. CEACAM7 was concentrated using a centrifugal filter unit (10 kDa MWCO, Millipore) and dialyzed against 20 mM Tris\u2013HCl, 100 mM NaCl pH 7.5. CEACAM7 at 5.9 mg ml1 was screened against The JCSG+ Suite screen (Qiagen) data were collected on beamline 23-ID-B at the Advanced Photon Source (APS), Argonne National Laboratory, USA. data were processed using HKL-2000 (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997 ). Molecular replacement was performed using MOLREP (Vagin & Teplyakov, 2010 ) and a CHAINSAW model of CEACAM5. an I/(I) of 28.0 (1.57) R r.i.m. 0.130 (0.666) Overall B factor from Wilson plot (2) 18.3 CC1/2 0.993 (0.664) The data were extended owing to a reasonable CC1/2 value. CEACAM7 was loaded into cells equipped with six-hole Epon centerpieces. centrifugation was carried out at 29 000, 32 000 and 35 000 rev min1. scans were acquired at 280 nm with a step size of 0.001 and five averages per step. inclusion bodies were washed with a high-salt buffer (50 mM Tris\u2013HCl, 1.0 M NaCl pH 8.0) to remove DNA, followed by lysis buffer without Triton X-100. refolded CEACAM7 was dialyzed against 10 mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 8.0 and concentrated by anion-exchange chromatography. CEACAM7 crystallization was concentrated using a Centricon centrifugal filter unit (10 kDa MWCO, Millipore) and dialyzed against 20 mM Tris\u2013HCl, 100 mM NaCl pH 7.5.

Thr57 is too short to form a hydrogen bond across the dimer interface to Asp95 (purple)"}
