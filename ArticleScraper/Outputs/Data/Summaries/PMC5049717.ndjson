{"summary": "crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus causes a severe and frequently fatal hemorrhagic disease in people, with a mortality rate of approximately 30%. it is the second most widespread of the medically important viral hemorrhagic fever viruses, after dengue virus,3. CCHF is distributed over much of Asia, the Middle East, Africa and expanding areas of south-eastern Europe. the most promising CCHF vaccine candidate published to date is a Modified Vaccinia Ankara vector expressing the full-length glycoproteins. the genome of CCHF virus is distributed over 3 RNA segments: small (S), medium (M) and large (L) which encode the viral nucleoprotein (NP), glycoprotein and RNA polymerase, respectively. the NP of CCHF virus consists of a large, globular domain, plus a protrusion that contains a conserved caspase-3 cleavage site. it has been shown that the nucleoprotein is cleaved in apoptotic cells at later stages of infection. a deficiency in the type-1 interferon receptor did not affect the induction of humoral or cell-mediated immune responses of the MVA-NP3010 vaccine in these assays. both strains of mice were immunised with the vaccine. sera from vaccinated mice were tested for reactivity with a baculovirus-expression recombinant CCHFv NP (lane 4) and CCHFv-infected (lane 3) or uninfected (lane 2) SW13 cells by Western blotting. a challenge model developed for infection with strain IbAr10200 of CCHF virus was planned. sera from vaccinated A129 mice tested for reactivity with a baculovirus-expression recombinant CCHFv NP (lane 4) and CCHFv-infected (lane 3) or uninfected (lane 2) SW13 cells by Western blotting. Efficacy of MVA-NP Survival mice (n = 9 per group) were vaccinated with 2 doses of MVA-NP10200 spaced at 2 weeks intervals mice were challenged with double the minimum lethal dose of CCHFv, 14 d after booster vaccination with MVA-NP10200 (gray bars) or MVA-1974 (black bars) 3 randomly selected animals from each group were killed humanely and analyzed by RT-PCR for CCHFv gene expression. MVA-NP3010 was used in a Western blot assay to verify the proper expression of the inserted CCHF NP. a band of 62.5 kDa was observed. this was consistent with the estimated size of the CCHF NP of 52 kDa,29 plus the V5 tag. vaccinated mice were restimulated with peptides derived from the CCHFv nucleoprotein. peptides from the tPA and V5 fusion partners split into 2 pools. a representative animal from each mouse strain is shown. vaccinated mice were restimulated with peptides derived from the CCHFv nucleoprotein split into 2 pools and summed. black, white and gray bars denote animals given saline, MVA-1974 and MVA-NP. all (5/5) A129 and 129Sv/Ev mice developed an antibody response specific to NP. a deficiency in the type-1 interferon receptor did not affect the induction of humoral or cell-mediated immune responses of the MVA-NP3010 vaccine. a NP-specific T-cell response was detected in all of the vaccinated animals. a representative A129 mouse vaccinated with MVA-NP10200 was tested for reactivity with a baculovirus-expression recombinant CCHFv NP. a129 mice were challenged with double the minimum lethal dose of CCHFv. they were challenged with double the minimum lethal dose of CCHFv 14 d after booster vaccination with CCHFv. blood, spleen and liver were collected 4 d post-challenge from animals challenged with the empty vector. in the liver, changes comprised multifocal, hepatocyte necrosis, characterized by cytoplasmic eosinophilia and nuclear pyknosis. positively stained hepatocytes, detected by immunohistochemistry, were observed scattered throughout the parenchyma. blood, spleen and liver were collected 4 d post-challenge from animals challenged with MVA-1974 and MVA-NP10200. there were no differences between animals challenged with the empty vector versus those that were immunised with the CCHF vaccine candidate. positively stained hepatocytes, detected by immunohistochemistry, were observed scattered throughout the parenchyma. a homologous prime-boost approach was undertaken as we have demonstrated that this induced increased numbers of antigen-specific T cells compared to a single dose. the NP in Bunyavirus infection has been recognized as the predominant antigen, inducing a high immune response. in 2010, 2 murine models susceptible to CCHF virus were published with deletions in either STAT-1.39 or the type-I interferon receptor. FN- is a major cytokine involved in the adaptive immune response. we compared the immune responses in mice with the type-I interferon receptor deficiency and the parental wild-type strain. no differences were observed in either the antibody or cell-mediated response, demonstrating that the knockout mice elicited similar responses. the vaccine candidate demonstrated antigen-specific immunogenicity in mice. but failed to exert any protective effects upon challenge with CCHF virus. this is the first report of a vaccine against CCHF virus based on nucleoprotein. plasmids Plasmid pLW-44 encoded the green fluorescence protein (GFP) reporter gene under control of the p11 promoter. an expression cassette controlled by the artificial promoter, mH5, which allowed constitutive expression of heterologous genes. recombinant tPA-NP-V5 fusion proteins downstream of the poxvirus mH5 promoter were infected with MVA at a multiplicity of infection of 0.05. infected cells were transfected with pTP-NP using Lipofectamine (Life Technologies) as directed by the manufacturer. animals received 107 pfu of non-recombinant MVA 1974 or equivalent volume of saline. tissues were collected 7 or 14 d after the final vaccination. cells were seeded in PVDF microtitre plates at 2 105 splenocytes per well. uninfected or uninfected SW13 cells were treated similarly for use as a negative control. cells were subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 4\u201312% Bis-Tris gel. membranes were incubated with mouse serum for 2 hours, washed 6 times with PBS containing 0.05% NP40 and 5% milk protein. euthanasia criteria consisted of 20% weight loss or observation of 2 abnormal clinical signs. samples of blood, spleen and liver were collected for viral load studies. samples of blood, spleen and liver were collected for viral load studies. guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) housekeeping gene was used. a one-step RT-PCR with singleplex detection was performed. CT values for CCHFv and HPRT were each inverted by subtracting the CT value from 45. polyclonal antibody raised in sheep immunised against recombinant CCHFv nucleoprotein was incubated with the tissue for 30 minutes, followed by a biotinylated rabbit anti-sheep polyclonal antibody (Abcam) at a dilution of 1500, for 10 minutes, followed by a biotinylated rabbit anti-sheep polyclonal antibody (Abcam) all work involving animals was performed in accordance with the United Kingdom Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. plasmids Plasmid pLW-44 encoded the green fluorescence protein (GFP) reporter gene under control of the p11 promoter and an expression cassette controlled by the artificial promoter, mH5. infected cells were transfected with pTP-NP using Lipofectamine. recombinant MVA-NP was serially plaque-purified 4 times in BHK-21 cells. cells were seeded in PVDF microtitre plates at 2 105 splenocytes per well. overlapping peptides spanning the length of the CCHF virus nucleoprotein consisting of 20mers were applied at a final concentration of 25 g/ml per peptide. infected or uninfected SW13 cells were subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 4\u201312% Bis-Tris gel. membranes were incubated with mouse serum for 2 hours, washed 6 times with PBS containing 0.05% NP40. all antibody dilutions were made in PBS containing 0.05% NP40 and 5% milk protein. samples of blood, spleen and liver were collected for viral load studies. whole blood (100 l) was collected into RNA Protect Animal Blood tubes. tubes were thawed, inverted and left for a further 2 hours at room temperature. CT values for CCHFv and HPRT were each inverted by subtracting the CT value from 45 (the total number of cycles) the mean value of CCHFv was then divided by the mean value of the HPRT reference gene for each sample. rabbit anti-sheep polyclonal antibody (Abcam) incubated with tissue for 30 minutes. positive and negative control slides were included."}
