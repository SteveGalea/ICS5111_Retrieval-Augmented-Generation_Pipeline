{"summary": "the genome of HCoV-NL63 is about 27 kb with a conserved gene order of 5\u2032-orf1ab-spike (S)-orf3-envelope (E)-membrane (M)-nucleocapsid (N)-poly (A) the species tropism of HCoV-NL63 is determined by spike glycoprotein. HCoV-NL63 is recognized as a common cause of upper respiratory libraries were prepared with the Nextera XT kit (Illumina) libraries were prepared with the Nextera XT kit (Illumina) paired-end reads were determined using a de novo assembly model. partial genome sequences of five HCoV-NL63 strains were obtained. 63 Primer Sequence (5\u2032\u20133\u2032) Target (nucleotide position) or amplification method Size (bp) 1F CCTGCTCTCTTTTTCACATGT 20504 1,686 1R ACTTCGACGGTTGTGCTTTTTCACATGT 20504 1,686 1R ACTTCGACGGTTGTGTCACCAGGTG 22059 1,623 2R CAAAGCTGCAAGCCGTCCAGTAATT 23681 1,62 R TTTGCGATATTCATGGCACGCTTCA 11235 1,435 12F ACCCTTCAGAGTGTTGCTTCATCATCAT 11090 1,378 12F AGTCGAGCTGCACTAGAACCCCTTG 11090 1,378 13F CAACCACTGTAACTAGCTTTCATGG 7758 2,103 13F CTGCCAAAATAGAATAGCACTCAAC 9860 2,103 14F GTCAAAAGGGTGATGCTGAAGGC 5424 2,39 phylogenetic analysis of HCoV-NL63 based on complete genomes. complete genomes of 69 coronavirus references were obtained from the GenBank database. multiple alignments were performed using MAFFT version 7.158 with default parameters."}
