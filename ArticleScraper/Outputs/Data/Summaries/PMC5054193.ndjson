{"summary": "the CV method has been successfully applied to infer phylogeny of viruses 4, 5, bacteria 1, 6, 7, chloroplast (8) and fungi (9) the majority of branches in the CVTrees agree well with the biologists\u2019 classification at all taxonomic ranks from phyla down to species. however, traditionally phylogenetic trees are subject to statistical re-sampling tests such as bootstrap or jackknife (10) bootstrap/jackknife tests are extremely time-consuming and soon come the epoch of inferring phylogeny for thousands of species in not-too-distant future. our ultimate goal is to advocate the viewpoint that one may give up routine statistical re-sampling tests for the robust and stable CV method, and rely on direct comparison of phylogeny with taxonomy. we used four datasets of protein sequences encoded in the genome. a collection of 41 archaea, 401 bacteria, and 8 eukarya genomes. the list of these 450 genomes may be fetched from the authors\u2019 webpage. jackknife and bootstrap tests are performed in the following way. we first take randomly 90% of proteins from the whole protein pool. this is done for all species and a CVTree is constructed by carrying out the crucial \u201csubtraction procedure\u201d (1). the average topological distance of 100 bootstrap trees is retained as the final result. in doing a bootstrap test, the probability that a designated protein is drawn at the first try is 1/M; the probability of being skipped is 1/M. at the limit of very big M, the latter goes to 11/e 0.63212. results and Discussion Jackknife results for the four datasets are shown in Figure 1. the lowest K=5 and 6 curves yield results closest to the original CVTrees. the topmost figure shows jackknife results for viruses. 109 genomes in hao and Qi, 2003 (17), 145 genomes in hao and Qi, 2004 (18), 222 genomes in Gao et al., 2006 (19), 440 genomes in Gao et al., 2007 (6), and 892 genomes in Li et al. (7). the subtraction procedure in CV method requires that the number of (K2)-peptide should not be too few: L/(20)(K2)>1, i.e., logL > (K2)(1+log2). In an order-of-magnitude discussion, we may take the total number L of amino acids in an organisms\u2019 proteome to be 105, 106, and 107 for viruses, prokaryotes, and fungi.
