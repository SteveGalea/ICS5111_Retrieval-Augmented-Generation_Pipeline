{"summary": "MARC-1455 and vero cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) primary PAM cells were prepared from 4-8-week-old piglets and cultured in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS22. PRRSV strain A2MC2, VR-2385 and Ingelvac PRRS\u00ae MLV were propagated and titrated in MARC-145 cells. Western blotting Total proteins in cell lysate samples were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membrane26. RNA isolation, reverse transcription, and real-time PCR Total RNA was isolated with the TRIzol Reagent (Life Technologies Corporation, Carlsbad, CA) following manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Plaque assay A plaque assay in MARC-145 cells was done to compare the growth property of A2MC2 high passage with the wild type virus15. the cells were stained at 72 h after incubation by addition of 2 ml neutral red mixture with agarose. three-week-old PRRSV-negative piglets weighing from 3.2 to 7.5 kg were randomly divided into five groups with 4 pigs in each group. piglets were inoculated with 1 ml of PRRSV strains A2MC2-P9, A2MC2-P75, A2MC2-P90, and Ingelvac PRRS\u00ae MLV. three-week-old PRRSV-negative piglets were randomly divided into four groups. group 4 was mock-infected with PBS pH7.2. pigs were euthanized on DPI48. piglets and cultured in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS22. Newcastle disease virus (NDV) strain LaSota was propagated and titrated in vero cells24. RNA isolation, reverse transcription, and real-time PCR were conducted to amplify target PRRSV sequences or to determine PRRSV RNA level22,27. primers 85nspF3 (5\u2032CTCGACGAACTCAAAGACC3\u2032) and 32nsp2R2 (5\u2032CTGCGGACGGAGCTGATGTGC3\u2032) were used to amplify the target fragment. a2MC2 was diluted to 10 and 100 TCID50 per ml and added to monolayer cells in 6-well plates at 1 ml per well. the cells were stained at 72 h after incubation by addition of 2 ml neutral red mixture with agarose and observed for plaques after further overnight incubation. three-week-old PRRSV-negative piglets weighing from 3.2 to 7.5 kg were randomly divided into five groups with 4 pigs in each group. the piglets in groups 1 to 4 were inoculated with 1 ml of PRRSV A2MC2-P9, A2MC2-P75, A2MC2-P90, and Ingelvac PRRS\u00ae MLV. serum samples of DPI35 were tested with a commercial PRRSV ELISA kit. a sample-to-positive (S/P) ratio greater than 0.4 was considered positive. A2MC2-P90 induces synthesis of interferons. treatment with 1000 U IFN- was included as a control. compared with treatment of mock-infected cells, the treatment with supernatant led to 97.8 and 141.5-fold higher RIG-I and MDA5 transcript levels. treatment with supernatant from VR-2385-infected cells had only 0.9 and 0.7-fold of RIG-I and MDA5 transcript levels, respectively. a plaque assay was done for A2MC2-P90 and compared with wild type A2MC2. virions of A2MC2-P90 were used for RNA isolation and RT-PCR. virions of A2MC2-P90 were used for RNA isolation and RT-PCR. compared to the wild type, the A2MC2-P90 has 35 nucleotide mutations. among which 26 are non-synonymous, leading to 26 amino acid changes. a deletion (Del) in A2MC2-P90 from nt2994 to 3536 is indicated. some nucleotides locate in ORF overlap regions. dAmino acids derived from the codon of indicated nucleotides are listed. ePRRSV viral proteins corresponding to the amino acids derived from the codon of indicated nucleotides are listed. 5 of the 6 unique amino acid residues of A2MC2 remained the same in A2MC2-P90. the conserved five nucleotides leading to unique amino acids are nt7621, 9655, 12012, 12972 and 12975. the five unique residues are Ser20 in nsp8/9, Leu13 in nsp10, Gly135 in nsp12, and Val93 and Val94 in GP3 the passages P30 to P80 were tested. the PCR product from the genome without deletion is 1.262 kb. the passages P60 to P63 were tested. a multi-step growth curve was also done to determine the propagation of A2MC2-P90 in PAM cells. the virus yields of PAMs inoculated at an MOI of 0.5 were 4.6, 4.6 and 4.8 Log10/ml 24, 48 and 72 hpi respectively. pigs infected with A2MC2-P75 and A2MC2-P90 had pathology scores similar to the MLV-infected or mock-infected pigs. all the groups except for A2MC2-P9 had no significant difference from the mock-infected control group. pigs in groups of A2MC2-P9 and A2MC2-P90 had detectable VN antibodies at DPI28. the average VN titers of the groups were higher than those in MLV group for DPI28, DPI35 and DPI42 samples. a2MC2-P90 retains the capacity of IFN induction of the wild type A2MC2. treatment with 1000 U IFN- was included as a control. treatment with 1000 U IFN- was included as a control. compared with treatment of mock-infected cells, the treatment with supernatant led to 97.8 and 141.5-fold higher RIG-I and MDA5 transcript levels. treatment with supernatant from VR-2385-infected cells had only 0.9 and 0.7-fold of RIG-I and MDA5 transcript levels. the cells were inoculated with A2MC2 virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01, 0.1 or 1 per cell. virions of A2MC2-P90 were used for RNA isolation and RT-PCR. in ORF1a, the A2MC2-P90 has 35 nucleotide mutations, among which 26 are non-synonymous, leading to 26 amino acid changes. the top line indicates the genomic sequence of VR-2332 and the numbers above the line indicate nucleotide positions in the genome. ePRRSV viral proteins corresponding to the amino acids derived from the codon of indicated nucleotides are listed on the right column. dAmino acids derived from the codon of indicated nucleotides are listed. 5 of the 6 unique amino acid residues of A2MC2 compared to the MLV and VR-233215 remained the same in A2MC2-P90. the conserved five nucleotides leading to unique amino acids are nt7621, 9655, 12012, 12972 and 12975. the five unique residues are Ser20 in nsp8/9, Leu13 in nsp10, Gly135 in nsp12 PCR detection of the nsp2 deletion in a2MC2 passage. the passages P30 to P80 were tested. the passages P60 to P63 were tested. the virus yields of PAMs inoculated at an MOI of 0.5 were 4.6, 4.6 and 4.8 Log10/ml 24, 48 and 72 hpi. the objective of the serial passaging of A2MC2-P90 was to attenuate the strain. the interstitial pneumonia scores of the pigs infected with A2MC2-P75 and A2MC2-P90 were significantly lower than pigs infected with A2MC2-P9. both groups except for A2MC2-P9 had no significant difference from the mock-infected control group. pigs in groups of A2MC2-P9 and A2MC2-P90 had detectable VN antibodies at DPI28. the average VN titers of the groups were higher than those in MLV group. 14 of 15 unique nucleotides of A2MC2 in comparison with both VR-2332 and MLV15 are conserved in the A2MC2-P90 genome. these residues do not correlate with virulence as the A2MC2-P90 is avirulent. the nsp9 is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. nsp9 and nsp10 were found to contribute to fatal virulence of high pathogenic PRRSV strains in china36. there are one and three different amino acid residues in nsp9 and nsp10, respectively. there is no unique synonymous mutations in nsp9 and nsp10 in A2MC2-P90. ELISA results show that all PRRSV-infected pigs had detectable VN antibodies by DPI35. the pigs infected with A2MC2-P90 had higher VN titers than the MLV group.
