{"summary": "use of antimicrobials contributes to the emergence and spread of resistant bacteria in both humans and animals. as early as in the 1960's concerns arose in relation to therapeutic, preventive and growth-promoting treatments in food-producing animals. the collection of data at animal level is the ultimate goal of antimicrobial monitoring systems. alternatives using normalization of sales data by the total weight of the food producing animal population as a denominator have been developed. other institutions have implemented similar methods in their surveillance systems. sales data are collected from marketing authorization holders based on Article 35 of the Ordinance of Veterinary Medicines. products subject to data collection are defined by their ATCvet codes (19) as listed in the ESVAC project (12) biomass repartition was done according to biomass repartition. for each product authorized for one or more target species, each target species was assigned a percentage of kg of the total sales representing the proportion of its biomass in the total biomass of the list of authorized species. only few antimicrobials are primarily used in piglets or weaners. no data available to stratify antimicrobial consumption per different age classes. sales data will only be available once reporting of all treatments with antimicrobials in Switzerland is mandatory at the end of the year 2019. the weight at treatment for pigs was taken from a previous study by Schnetzer et al. and the weight for calves based on expert opinion. therapeutic intensity reflects the number of ACDs per slaughtered animal in 1 year. sales data collected from the federal office of food safety based on Article 35 of the Ordinance of Veterinary Medicines. since 2004, sales data are collected from marketing authorization holders based on Article 35 of the Ordinance of Veterinary Medicines. biomass repartition was done according to biomass repartition. for each product authorized for one or more target species, each target species was assigned a percentage of kg of the total sales representing the proportion of its biomass in the total biomass of the list of authorized species. only few antimicrobials are primarily used in piglets or weaners. sales data will only be available once reporting of all treatments with antimicrobials in Switzerland is made mandatory at the end of the year 2019. for injectable products authorized without indication of the production stage. the weight at treatment for pigs was taken from a previous study by Schnetzer et al. and the weight for calves based on expert opinion. therapeutic intensity reflects the number of ACDs per slaughtered animal (pig or calf) in 1 year. sales of antibiotics for use in food producing animals decreased by 29.8%. pigs and calves are the most pertinent species among food producing animals to be investigated for use and trend detection. sales data detailed by antimicrobial classes for the years under investigation are available under https://www.blv.admin.ch/blv/de/home/tiere/publikationen-und-forschung/statistiken-berichte-tiere.html. the total number of ACDs was approximately 4.5 times higher in pigs and decreased by 31.7%. the repartition of the number of ACDs per class of antimicrobials was therefore calculated separately for each species for the year 2015. in calves, the highest number of ACDs per animal was represented by macrolides, followed by aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones. classes of antimicrobials Pigs Calves Parenteral Premixes Parenteral Premixes

Macrolides 0.170 0.145 0. sales of antimicrobials for the veterinary medicine are published at national level since 2005. this is the first study at national level using the ACD concept applied to sales of antimicrobials. this is the only available source of exhaustive consumption data at national level. study used weights at treatment as close as possible to the Swiss reality. this should provide the best fitting results, and also guarantees future reproducibility of the method and comparison of results. the method used to stratify antimicrobial consumption by the production types included in the study has some potential bias. the denominators of the indicators presented were likely weights at treatment as defined in the ESVAC project 12. the results should be interpreted as an indicator for the amount of active ingredient used per kg of animal produced. the therapeutic intensity indicates the average number of ACDs per animal produced/slaughtered. the repartition for pigs in the year 2015 shows that 18% of the active ingredients were used parenterally when based on quantity, whereas they represented 51% of the treatments when using ACDs. the main reason for this difference lies in the potency of the active ingredients: antimicrobials are used parenterally with a lower dose. studies show a strong difference in the extrapolated usage of antimicrobials in pigs and calves. this cannot be explained by a single factor as the administration of antimicrobials is driven by medical, economic and also psychosocial factors. in pigs, there are two main periods at risk for treatment with antimicrobials. no publication presents the French antimicrobial consumption using ACDs per animal and year as an indicator. the global ALEA calculated for the year 2015 in France was 0.488. the average for the pig population is set at 105 kg. this is in line with the present study where the antimicrobial use was 2.77-fold higher in calves than in pigs. both examples clearly illustrate the need to harmonize methodologies at international level in order to discuss data collected in different countries. research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
