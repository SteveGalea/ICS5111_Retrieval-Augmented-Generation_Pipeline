{"summary": "Legionellae have the ability to replicate in environmental protozoa and within mammalian alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells. bacteria can enter the human respiratory tract and cause disease manifesting as Legionnaires' disease, a severe form of pneumonia, or Pontiac fever, a self-limiting flu-like illness. the lack of available diagnostic tests for species other than L. pneumophila may lead to underreporting and/or unrecognized cases of legionellosis. an improved detection method would ideally integrate a more inclusive approach for identification and characterization. multiple TaqMan primer-probe sets were designed targeting the ssrA gene (GenBank accession no. AE017354 [bp 172917 to 173015]) purified total nucleic acid from L. pneumophila sg1 strain Philadelphia was used as a positive control. the assay was carried out using the ABI 7500 real-time PCR system. 500 pg of Legionella anisa (Fig. 1A), L. pneumophila sg2 (Fig. 1B), L. pneumophila sg1 (Fig. 1C), and human nucleic acid were run in duplicate. all channels shown to display assay specificity and lack of cross-channel signal bleed. clinical isolate cultures previously characterized by mip sequencing were normalized to 1 ng/l and tested using the multiplex assay for specificity. these data demonstrate assay specificity and sensitivity and provide an overall improvement in the diagnostic capability for detecting and characterizing causes of legionellosis. NP swab, OP swab, and NP swab, bronchial, oropharyngeal, and nasopharyngeal swabs, respectively. multiplex real-time analysis of Legionella clinical isolates Species (na) Multiplex real-time PCR CT value Legionella spp. single-tube, 4-plex real-time PCR assay capable of simultaneous detection and differentiation of Legionella spp., Legionella pneumophila, and Legionella pneumophila sg1. multiplex assay is considerably faster (4 h versus 8 days) and easier to interpret than culture."}
