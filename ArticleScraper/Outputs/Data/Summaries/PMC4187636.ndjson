{"summary": "the clinical microbiology laboratory has responsibilities ranging from characterizing the causative agent of a patient's infection to helping detect global disease outbreaks. effective application of informatics tools can increase accuracy, timeliness, and completeness of microbiology testing while decreasing the laboratory workload. studies have demonstrated that implementation of informatics tools can improve the efficiency, accuracy, precision, and rapidity of microbiology testing and reporting (2\u20137). burgeoning areas of clinical microbiology informatics include total laboratory automation, telemicrobiology, and microbial whole-genome sequencing. \"Clinical microbiology informatics\" is the use of information (e.g., data, knowledge, and results) and information tools (e.g., software, databases, and rules) in the \"science and service dealing with detection, identification, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing\" of clinically relevant microbes and the communication of these results to clinicians (8). the microbiology LIS has been in development and use for about half a century. it needs to be secure, user-friendly, and able to interface with other information systems. but there are several unique features of the microbiology LIS which are not used in other clinical laboratories. the physical derivatives also require accurate tracking and identification on the bench. the best practice for proper identification employs the use of bar-coded labels on all assets (12, 13) and the best practice for proper identification employs the use of bar-coded labels on all assets (12, 13) results reporting The microbiology LIS requires unique features involving how results are conveyed to clinicians. results often include qualitative, semiquantitative, and/or quantitative data. results often include qualitative, semiquantitative, and/or quantitative data, which can complicate data structures in the LIS. a yeast isolate may be identified as Candida sp., which is preliminarily reported to the hospital information system via the LIS. preliminary results are suppressed but traceable so the clinician viewing the chart can easily identify the most accurate and up-to-date results. the college of American Pathologists requires that these interfaces be verified every 2 years (GEN.48500) (20) multiple-derivative tracking samples sent to the microbiology laboratory often produce more than a single result. the final type and number of results are typically not known until the testing is under way. bar codes use solid lines (1-D bar codes) or blocks (2-D bar codes) in combination with intervening spaces to encode data. the words \u201cStaphylococcus aureus\u201d are depicted in a 1-D bar code using Code 128 symbology (A) and a 2-D bar code using DataMatrix symbology (B). these symbologies are commonly used to label specimens in clinical laboratories. microbiology results often include qualitative, semiquantitative, and/or quantitative data, which can complicate data structures in the LIS (14). multiple organisms can grow in culture, each with susceptibility results, interpretive comments, and potentially different clinical relevancies, so report design is paramount to supporting safe interpretation by health care providers (15). a yeast isolate may be identified as Candida sp., which is preliminarily reported to the hospital information system via the LIS. it is important that the preliminary results are suppressed but traceable so the clinician viewing the chart can easily identify the most accurate and up-to-date results. LIS software typically has the ability to use keyboard shortcuts to enter repetitive texts. the software can be programmed so that when \u201c;sa\u201d is entered by the scientist on the bench, the entry expands into \u201cStaphylococcus aureus\u201d these data entry methods allow results and comments to be entered quickly and accurately and are most useful for entering lengthy, repetitive texts. the LIS and HIS must be operational before implementing a new microbiology test. results in the LIS need to be transmitted downstream to the HIS. the college of American Pathologists requires that these interfaces be verified every 2 years. studies suggest that the best way to communicate important microbiology results is still direct communication of those results to a treating clinician via a telephone call (24, 25). the antibiogram is helpful in facilitating the selection of an appropriate therapy for an infecting organism prior to knowledge of the antimicrobial susceptibility test results for the specific isolate infecting the patient. guidelines currently recommend incorporating the results for a species only the first time it is isolated from a patient in the period being considered (28, 31). in creating an antibiogram, data stratification may be necessary for some bacteria in some patient populations. tools to optimize the clinical selection of appropriate antimicrobial therapy (22). some simpler tools work to provide improved antibiograms (33) or work similarly to an antibiogram to help in the selection of an appropriate empirical antimicrobial agent (34). others work to support the determination of whether or not a true infection is present (35) or can alert a physician if a patient is failing therapy. new microbiology results may require a change in antimicrobial therapy. software flags a chart for review by an infectious disease physician when a result of interest is reported after discharge. the specialist can subsequently contact the treating physician if a change in therapy is potentially indicated. software tools can be incorporated into the workflow to identify and characterize potential contamination in molecular testing (43). the use of these types of software is a practical means by which informatics tools can offload some of the work from humans and thereby increase efficiency and improve the consistent quality of results reporting. each species isolated from each patient be incorporated into the annual antibiogram calculation only once per period, per site of infection, or per unique phenotype (28, 29, 31). guidelines currently recommend incorporating results for a species only the first time it is isolated from a patient in the period being considered (28, 31). more software tools are needed to optimize the clinical selection of appropriate antimicrobial therapy. some simpler tools work to provide improved antibiograms (33) or work similarly to an antibiogram to help in the selection of an appropriate empirical antimicrobial agent (34). others work to support the determination of whether or not a true infection is present (35) or can alert a physician if a patient is failing therapy (36). software flags a chart for review by an infectious disease physician when a result of interest is reported after discharge. the specialist can subsequently contact the treating physician if a change in therapy is potentially indicated. some laboratories have gone as far as withholding the routine release of such results in an attempt to decrease inappropriate antimicrobial therapy. software tools can be incorporated into the workflow to identify and characterize potential contamination in molecular testing (43). the use of these types of software is a practical means by which informatics tools can offload some of the work from humans and thereby increase efficiency. an expert system contains three main parts: a knowledge base (i.e., known facts), an inference engine (i.e., the rules), and a user interface (38). an expert system is software that combines a database of information with a set of rules to help make a conclusion about an input. microbial resistance by comparing a clinical isolate's MIC values to a curated database of strains which have had their MIC values and mechanism(s) of resistance characterized (45). the expert system also has rules which check to see if some drug results need to be reported as resistant even though the organism might test as sensitive in vitro. expert systems can withhold inappropriate results or release appropriate results. antimicrobial test results can be withheld when the patient's age or the specimen source suggests that the drug's use would be inappropriate. expert systems can also alert a laboratory scientist when additional work-up needs to be performed on an isolate. the need for expert systems Traditionally, simple rules have been used by microbiologists for linking the detected phenotype of an organism to a clinically actionable finding. but identifying resistance mechanisms can be less straightforward in other situations, such as identifying and distinguishing extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing, AmpC-hyperproducing, and wild-type Enterobacteriaceae bacteria (38, 44) an expert system is a form of artificial intelligence that allows a user to use software rules (inference engine) together with a knowledge database to make a conclusion about an input. expert systems can alert the user to an unusual AST pattern for an identified organism, alter the AST interpretation of one antimicrobial based upon the interpretation of test results for a second antimicrobial. expert systems can also be used to infer the mechanism of antimicrobial resistance by comparing a clinical isolate's MIC values to becton, Dickinson, and Company uses an expert system (BDXpert) to analyze the identification and AST of microorganisms from its BD Phoenix system. BDXpert examines the AST interpretations initially identified by the instrument and may make changes to the interpretations before communicating the results to the LIS. expert systems can be used to aggregate and report metrics of interest. MIC trends of an organism can be visualized, infection rates in a given hospital unit can be identified, or blood culture contamination rates associated with a particular clinical area can be examined. expert systems could have the ability to \u201cread\u201d plate cultures and report autoverified results. clinical microbiology laboratory routinely uses instrumentation for three components of analysis: taxonomic identification of an isolated colony, determination of the AST of an isolated colony, and detection of microbial growth. a separate instrument is often used for the detection of microbial growth in continuously monitored blood cultures. an increasing number of stand-alone niche instruments are used in microbiology for nucleic acid testing or antigen testing. communication typically occurs via serial port (RS-232) and follows CLSI specification guidelines LIS01-A2 and LIS02-A2. LIS02-A2 standard is applicable to all text-oriented instruments. interfaces of common instruments are the nuts and bolts of informatics. BD instruments include blood culture (BacTec FX or 9000 series), mycobacterial detection and AST (BD Phoenix) instruments. BD uses a data management system (EpiCenter) hosted by a server to integrate patient demographics it receives from the LIS and results it receives from BD instruments. newer BD instruments have been designed be able to interact directly with an LIS. bioMeri\u00e9ux instruments include blood culture (e.g., BacT/ALERT3D) and identification and AST (e.g., Vitek 2) instruments. results from these instruments can be centralized in an Observa workstation. labPro can push and pull information to and from an LIS. labPro can collect patient information and results from manually performed test results recorded in the LIS. expert system can identify results that need further review. results from instruments, whether performing FDA-approved tests or laboratory-developed tests, should be integrated seamlessly into the LIS. so too does the need for better software to clearly collect, display, and integrate ongoing specimen processes and reported results. middleware solutions can also help to unify microbiology results into a more manageable and user-friendly centralized system. interfaces of Common Instruments Instrument interfaces are the nuts and bolts of informatics for clinical laboratories. this component of informatics typically requires more technical expertise than clinical expertise. it is important that data be arranged in a standard fashion according to specific protocols when being relayed between systems. BD instruments include blood culture (BacTec FX or 9000 series), mycobacterial detection and AST (BacTec MGIT 960) and identification and AST (BD Phoenix) instruments. BD uses a data management system (EpiCenter) hosted by a server that is designed to integrate patient demographics it receives from the LIS. bioMeri\u00e9ux's blood culture instruments allow for varied levels of LIS integration. there are options for no integration with an LIS, direct LIS interface, or LIS interface by means of bioMeri\u00e9ux data management systems (BacT/VIEW or Observa) workstations that directly interface with the instrument by using a private network are supplied by BD. BD uses a data management system (EpiCenter) hosted by a server that is designed to integrate patient demographics it receives from the LIS, results it receives from BD instruments, and results from manually performed microbiology tests. LIS, direct LIS interface, or LIS interface by means of bioMeri\u00e9ux data management systems (BacT/VIEW or Observa) interfacing with the LIS through any means requires the use of BacT/LINK (middleware) tests can be pushed to the BacT/Alert by the LIS, or the BacT/Alert can pull test orders from the LIS. the Tigris DTS receives orders sent by the LIS, but a user can still manually request the LIS to send orders to the instrument. instruments employed for laboratory-developed molecular tests vary in interoperability with the LIS. instruments that are fully integrated with the LIS system by means of bidirectional interfaces. the clinical microbiology laboratory has been looking to automation to overcome this shortcoming for the last half century. automation has traditionally been used only for discrete portions of the analysis pipeline. automation has traditionally been used only for discrete portions of the analysis pipeline. some laboratories in the united states are preparing to implement TLA (63) potential advantages include decreased operational costs, improved standardization of processing and testing, increased throughput capability, increased numbers of isolated colonies per plate, management of various specimen types simultaneously, decreased turnaround times, greater specimen traceability, and decreased human workloads. the flow of information from instrument to instrument in the automated microbiology laboratory is a new challenge for clinical microbiology informatics informatics. atics have allowed for TLA to become a realistic option for the clinical microbiology laboratory (66) the automated system is needed to facilitate the automated flow of data through and between multiple instrument components (or workbenches), the LIS, and the HIS. the flow of information from instrument to instrument in the automated microbiology laboratory is a new challenge for clinical microbiology informatics. the flow of information from instrument to instrument in the automated microbiology laboratory is a new challenge for clinical microbiology informatics. remote analysis of microbiology (telemicrobiology) has been implemented only sparsely. there is growing interest in the transmission of microbiology images for remote analysis and consultation (71) there is growing interest in the transmission of microbiology images for remote analysis and consultation. telepathology requires a team approach where the local group can supply the clinical history and electronic images. the remote consultant can provide the diagnostic expertise after interpreting the image(s) an image without relevant metadata is of limited value. it is important that all image submissions be accompanied by CDC Form 50.34. the study used high-power microscopic images for cellular morphology analysis and low-power microscopic images for bacterial colony morphology analysis. multiple microbiology samples were analyzed, including thick and thin blood smears for malaria, stool samples for parasites, diluted bacterial suspensions, and bacterial colonies on plates. previously studies using WSI scanners routinely digitize glass slides at a magnification of 20 reported that pathologists were unable to clearly visualize microscopic organisms. automated digital image analysis has been implemented successfully in cytology, cytogenetics, and hematology laboratories. automated image capture and analysis have the potential to be used as a low-cost screening tool to detect malarial infections in resource-poor settings. the future of telemicrobiology and automated digital image analysis regulations, guidelines, and administrative matters are beginning to emerge. telemicrobiology and TLA could provide information beyond what is currently available in the clinical microbiology laboratory. experts are scarce, and the likelihood of a laboratory having on-site expertise is low. an image without relevant metadata is of limited value. the importance of a patient's clinical history is often essential in providing the best diagnostic evaluation in medicine. telemicrobiology was first implemented in a german military field hospital in 2003 (3). telemicrobiology system was instrumental in everyday microbiology testing. a remote photographer was reliant on the off-site consultant for analysis. the study also demonstrated one of the main shortcomings of static telemicrobiology. it could be achieved by allowing the off-site consultant to analyze the entire glass slide via robotic telemicroscopy and/or whole-slide imaging. automated microscopic digital image analysis tools are not being used routinely in clinical microbiology. the use of automated digital image analysis can increase the amount of information obtained from samples (80), standardize the interpretation of samples (77\u201379), and/or decrease the human time required to analyze samples (81\u201383). remote telemicrobiology allows microbiology laboratories to have rapid access to off-site expert opinions. formal microbiology expert consults are typically performed by sending an isolate or sample to another laboratory for repeated or additional work-up. this type of consult can drastically lengthen the specimen's turnaround time and often results in some amount of redundant testing. MICROBIAL IDENTIFICATION AND CHARACTERIZATION USING DATABASES Databases are commonly used for the identification of microorganisms. common databases include biochemical reaction databases, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization\u2013time of flight databases. low-performance liquid chromatography databases are used for the identification of mycobacteria (92\u201394) the identification system compares the qualitative findings of multiple biochemical tests to its database of known reactions that are specific for a group of taxa. by this means the system is able to determine the most probable identity of an unknown isolate. the selection of an inappropriate test panel can affect the sensitivity and specificity of the test. bruker or Vitek systems are used for microbial identification by MALDI-TOF. bruker's system converts raw spectra from a test sample into a numerical list of peaks. if none of the peaks in a reference spectrum are present in the test sample, then a score of 0 is assigned. Vitek algorithm classifies each identified mass peak as belonging within a \u201cmass bin\u201d where the average bin contains peaks that fall within a range of about 10 Da. the software uses supervised machine learning to identify bins that correlate with a taxon. a bin that is always filled (sensitive) and only filled (specific) when a given taxon is analyzed will be assigned a large negative weight. in identifying an organism, it may be most appropriate to compare the spectrum of an unknown isolate to the most rigorously curated database first (e.g., a research use only [RUO] database, an in-house database, or a database shared by a colleague) if the well-curated database poorly identifies the organism. but it is not yet clear in which circumstances this type of database query is most appropriate. nucleic acid sequence analysis is usually a laboratory-developed test. the local microbiology laboratory is responsible for developing, validating, and maintaining the test. the largest and most comprehensive nucleic acid databases are also the most poorly curated and error-prone databases. a perfect match of a queried nucleic acid sequence with a reference database sequence should not be assumed to correctly identify the microorganism. it may be most appropriate to identify an organism as a more poorly matched reference strain than a more closely matched nonreference strain. a 99% match of a 16S rRNA gene to a staphylococcal species should be interpreted differently than a 99% match to a mycobacterial species (100). identifying organisms by their DNA sequences has become a gold standard in microbial identification. however, interpretation of a sequence by comparing it to a reference database has caveats. the advent of clinical WGS and MGS in the clinical microbiology laboratory will hinge on informatics capabilities and resources that will be greater than those of any other clinical microbiology informatics endeavor to date. clinical WGS and MGS provide potential advantages for better characterizing pathogens and the microbiome. bioinformatics approaches are varied across the global community. there is no platform offering complete data processing, database management, and data warehousing capabilities; therefore, institutions are currently required to establish their own data analysis pipelines. these pipelines should work to improve the quality of data and minimize the amount of human time required for analysis. analysis of WGS and MGS data requires multidisciplinary teams of microbiologists, informaticians, clinicians, and epidemiologists. aligning and closing the genome are useful steps to ensure full characterization and optimal primer design for future rapid nucleic acid tests. aligning the genome is not as important as annotating virulence genes' functions. the most common approach to data storage is to rely on external hard drives, but this is not a sustainable plan going forward. a scalable capacity for warehousing, data compression, and systematic backup is needed. the complications of sharing nucleic acid sequences and its relevance to clinical laboratories are areas with ongoing legal debate and ramifications. the use of culture-free identification by means of massively parallel nucleic acid sequencing has shown potential in clinical studies (55, 56, 131) the use of nucleic acid analysis directly from samples can overcome culture bias (55, 147, 148) the use of nucleic acid analysis directly from samples can overcome culture bias (55, 147, 148) the identification system compares the qualitative findings of multiple biochemical tests to its database of known reactions that are specific for a group of taxa. the system is able to determine the most probable identity of an unknown isolate. a proprietary database is supplied as part of a manufacturer's method for identification. bruker or Vitek systems are used for microbial identification by MALDI-TOF. bruker's system converts raw spectra from a test sample into a numerical list of peaks. if all of the most prominent peaks in a reference spectrum are present in the test sample, then a score of 1 is assigned. the Vitek algorithm classifies each identified mass peak as belonging within a \u201cmass bin\u201d where the average bin contains peaks that fall within a range of about 10 Da. a bin that is always filled (sensitive) and only filled when a given taxon is analyzed will be assigned a large negative weight. a bin that is never filled when a given taxon is analyzed will be assigned a large negative weight. in identifying an organism, it may be most appropriate to compare the spectrum of an unknown isolate to the most rigorously curated database first (e.g., a research use only [RUO] database, an in-house database, or a database shared by a colleague) if the well-curated database poorly identifies the organism, MALDI-TOF analysis also has the ability to identify multiple organisms from a single inoculum. nucleic acid sequence analysis is usually a laboratory-developed test. there is no single nucleic acid database upon which users rely. the largest and most comprehensive nucleic acid databases are also the most poorly curated and error-prone databases. reference strains can provide more reliable identification than clinical or environmental strains. it may be most appropriate to identify an organism as a more poorly matched reference strain than a more closely matched nonreference strain. the reliability of the person who submitted the sequence to the database should be considered. a 99% match of a 16S rRNA gene to a staphylococcal species should be interpreted differently than a 99% match to a mycobacterial species (100). identifying organisms by their DNA sequences has become a gold standard in microbial identification. however, interpretation of a sequence by comparing it to a reference database has caveats. clinical WGS and MGS provide potential advantages for better characterizing pathogens and the microbiome. but they present new informatics challenges in a relatively short period. bioinformatics approaches are varied across the global community. there is no platform offering complete data processing, database management, and data warehousing capabilities; therefore, institutions are currently required to establish their own data analysis pipelines. establishing an efficient informatics pipeline for data generation, analysis, and storage for WGS or MGS is absolutely necessary. the goals of using WGS and MGS are not always the same, but the goals should guide the analyses. aligning and closing the genome are useful steps to ensure full characterization and optimal primer design for future rapid nucleic acid tests. aligning the genome is not as important as annotating virulence genes' functions. the most common approach to data storage is to rely on external hard drives, but this is not a sustainable plan going forward. external cloud services are currently not considered a viable option because they typically do not comply with medical confidentiality regulations. the complications of sharing nucleic acid sequences and its relevance to clinical laboratories are areas with ongoing legal debate and ramifications. the use of nucleic acid analysis directly from samples can overcome culture bias (55, 56, 131) in the future, genomic or metagenomic microbial analyses might replace or augment the current approach in clinical microbiology of culturing and identifying isolated microbes. the identification and classification of infection might also change dramatically. the largest and most comprehensive nucleic acid databases are also the most poorly curated and error-prone databases because they are created by a community of users with no peer review process. the current lack of freely available, robust, and reliable methods for identifying clinical bacteria by genotyping is recognized as a barrier (108) reference strains can provide more reliable identification than clinical or environmental strains. it may be most appropriate to identify an organism as a more poorly matched reference strain than a more closely matched nonreference strain. results from more current submissions may be preferred over older submissions. identifying organisms by their DNA sequences has become a gold standard in microbial identification. interpretation of a sequence by comparing it to a reference database has caveats. the advent of clinical microbial WGS and metagenomic sequencing (MGS) will hinge on informatics capabilities and resources that will be greater than those of any other clinical microbiology informatics endeavor. new evidence suggests that WGS improves the sensitivity and resolution of laboratory-based surveillance. new evidence suggests that WGS improves the identification and tracking of outbreaks in community and hospital settings. informatics pipeline for microbial genomic analysis in the clinical microbiology laboratory is absolutely necessary if clinical laboratories are going to accurately and cost-effectively interpret the data within a reasonable time frame. the pipelines should work to improve the quality of data and minimize the amount of human time required for analysis by maximizing the use of software. the goals of using WGS and MGS are not always the same, but the goals should guide the analyses. aligning and closing the genome are useful steps to ensure full characterization and optimal primer design for future rapid nucleic acid tests. however, aligning the genome is not as important as annotating virulence genes' functions. external cloud services are not considered a viable option because they typically do not comply with medical confidentiality regulations. the complications of sharing microbial organisms and their sequences recently made headline news as a disagreement between referring and reference laboratories occurred. the intellectual property rights related to the sequencing of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and the subsequent patenting of a diagnostic assay have reinforced the legal and ethical challenges of sharing microbial genetic material and data transfer (143). WGS and MGS may provide clinically relevant information regarding exactly which unique genes, pathways, and organisms are present in an infection (123\u2013127) new evidence suggests that WGS improves the sensitivity and resolution of laboratory-based surveillance. the pipelines should work to improve the quality of data and minimize the amount of human time required for analysis. the goals of using WGS and MGS are not always the same, but the goals should guide the analyses. the most important step in analysis is the identification of discriminatory features (e.g., SNPs, mutations, or a unique gene) the motivations for clinical WGS and MGS can be varied, and it is important to consider the goal(s) of the assay in determining how the data will be analyzed. ownership of nucleic acid sequences and relevance to clinical laboratories are areas with ongoing legal debate and ramifications. the intellectual property rights related to the sequencing of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and the subsequent patenting of a diagnostic assay have reinforced the legal and ethical challenges of sharing microbial genetic material and data transfer. the most important

subsequent patenting of a diagnostic assay have reinforced the legal and ethical challenges of sharing microbial genetic material and data transfer. the need for guidelines, such as calibration standards, acceptable data reliability, test robustness, result reproducibility, and data storage, are critically needed. computer algorithms can analyze and classify complex infections by using more variables than can currently be considered by a clinician or microbiologist. the microbiology laboratory might be expected to understand, evaluate, and recommend therapies based upon the analysis of pathobiomes (150), functionally equivalent pathogroups (126), supragenomes (124, 151), epigenomes (152, 153), or impaired or pathogenic microbiomes (154\u2013157). the more often information is exchanged between two nodes, the more incentive exists to create a robust electronic interface between these nodes. electronic reporting can expedite information communication and therefore expedite the detection of outbreak clusters. the CDC has been working to facilitate the electronic transmission of information from the local microbiology laboratory to public health agencies. the goal of NEDSS is to automate the reporting and analysis of public health surveillance data (163) 46 of 50 states in the united states use information systems that are compatible for reporting notifiable microbial findings to the CDC (163) the WHONET system was developed a quarter century ago by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance. the system works by translating laboratory data that are currently available in an LIS to a WHONET universal file format (169) a software utility, BacLink, can be used to facilitate this translation. the rapidity of regional outbreak identification can be enhanced by using electronic reporting by local laboratories. local clinical microbiology laboratories actively play a role in the detection of local disease outbreaks. syndromic surveillance infers the presence of an outbreak by analyzing patient signs and symptoms or analyzing public behavior. syndromic surveillance is performed completely in silico and has the potential to identify an outbreak before the laboratory can identify a causative agent. syndromic surveillance has a lower specificity of detection than laboratory surveillance. a first step in streamlining the reporting process is to have all stakeholders share a nomenclature. the goal of electronic reporting to public health agencies is to capture more reportable events, with increased timeliness and completeness, than those obtained with paper reporting. detecting, tracking, and modeling outbreaks are areas of continued interest in academia and public health (165, 166). rapid detection is of key importance because decreasing the time to detection can significantly decrease the adverse impact of an outbreak (167). software exists that can link the local laboratory with other regional and global laboratories in the bidirectional exchange of antimicrobial susceptibility data. local laboratories are not usually considered directly responsible for identifying regional and global outbreaks. local laboratories are essential in providing information to public health agencies so that identification of these outbreaks is possible. local clinical microbiology laboratories actively play a role in the detection of local outbreaks. prospective organism surveillance, laboratory surveillance, and syndromic surveillance are the most rapid means of detection. the local microbiology laboratory does not typically play a role in this type of screening. syndromic surveillance is increasingly being used to attempt early identification of outbreaks or bioterrorism (180, 181) detection of a potential outbreak by syndromic surveillance would alert the local laboratory to increase its vigilance or adjust its testing protocols so as to increase the laboratory's rapidity of identifying an outbreak. software exists that can link the local laboratory with other regional and global laboratories in the bidirectional exchange of antimicrobial susceptibility data. the system is designed to enable individual laboratories (or groups of laboratories) to manage their AST results, identify the emergence of resistant microbes, and identify trends in AST quality control testing (170, 171) analyses which WHONET can facilitate include examples such as the identification of changes in Escherichia coli isolate resistance within a country over time (172, 173). syndromic surveillance is increasingly being used to attempt early identification of outbreaks or bioterrorism. syndromic surveillance infers the presence of an outbreak by analyzing patient signs and symptoms or analyzing public behavior. syndromic surveillance infers the presence of an outbreak by analyzing patient signs and symptoms. syndromic surveillance can be used as a screening tool for detecting an outbreak. detection of a potential outbreak by syndromic surveillance would alert the local laboratory to increase its vigilance or adjust its testing protocols so as to increase the laboratory's rapidity of identifying an outbreak. informatics tools are needed to help the laboratory produce, interpret, and communicate the most useful information. informatics tools can help the clinical microbiology laboratory to do more with less while improving patient and public health care."}
