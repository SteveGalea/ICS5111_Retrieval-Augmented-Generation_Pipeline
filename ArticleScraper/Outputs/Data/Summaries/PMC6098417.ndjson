{"summary": "the rate of 72-hour ED revisits is high among adults with chronic diseases. no studies have evaluated the rate of 72-hour ED revisits. this study estimates the rate of 72-hour ED revisits. the rate of 72-hour ED revisits within 72 hours has not been documented among adults with chronic diseases in our center. the study may serve as a foundation of future studies on a national scale to assess Saudi health care system responsiveness. KAMC-RD included all adults of 18 years with at least one chronic disease discharged from the ED of KAMC-RD between September 13, 2015 and July 29, 2017. we focused on the most common chronic diseases set as nation health priorities for treatment and prevention, such as diabetes, heart disease, asthma, hypertension, and cancer. a multivariate negative binomial regression model was used to estimate the adjusted relative rate (aRR) and to identify independent factors associated with the high rate of ED revisits within 72 hours of ED discharge. strength of the relationship was assessed by RR and aRR with 95% CI. threshold of P-value 0.05 was used to determine the presence of statistical significance. a sample of 24,206 ED discharges for 19,697 adults with at least one chronic disease was included in the analysis. 3,144/24,206 (13%) had their first revisit, of which 319 (10.1%) had a second ED revisit within 72 hours after the initial visit. the most common reasons for the initial ED visit among adults with chronic diseases were diseases of the circulatory system (19%), genitourinary system (31.6%), various symptoms (4.7%), respiratory system (4.2%), the most common reasons for the second ED revisit within 72 hours after the initial visit were various symptoms (24.5%), issues with the genitourinary system (17.2%), pregnancy and childbirth (8.5%), issues with the digestive system (7.2%), issues with the circulatory system (7.2%), issues with the circulatory system (7.2%), issues with the circulatory system (7.2%), external causes (6.9%), and issues with the musculoskeletal system (5.6%). 1.11 0.001a 1.24 1.09 1.41 Health insurance coverage 0.001a 3.85 2.76 5.38 0.001a 4.23 2.60 6.90 Weekend ED arrival 0.001a 2.41 2.15 2.69 0.041a 2.13 1.03 4.41 New patient 0.001a 1.42 1.23 1.65 0.001a 1.47 1.25 1.73 Blood 0.103 0.81 0.63 1.04 0.382 2.47 0.33 18.67 Cause of morbidity or mortality 0.87 0.72 0.50 1. adults with chronic diseases and aged 60 years (aRR=1.60, 95% CI: 1.41\u20131.83; P=0.008), female gender (aRR=1.24, 95% CI: 1.09\u20131.41; P=0.001), having health insurance coverage (aRR=4.23, 95% CI: 2.60\u20136.90; P=0.001) and new patients (aRR=1.47, 95% CI: 1.25\u20131.73; P=0.001) increased the rate of revisits to the rate of ED revisits within 72 hours after ED discharge was widely reported in a recent multi-site study in the USA. our rate falls within the site-specific range from 1.1% to 15.2% that was reported from 31 hospitals in the USA. the high rate of ED revisits in adults with chronic diseases and aged 60 years may be due to an increased risk of developing a number of chronic diseases. a study is needed in future to evaluate the access to primary care clinics and the reasons for avoiding ED visits and revisits in this population. continuous quality assessment and monitoring of factors related to the patient are needed to reduce the frequency of early ED revisits after discharge. further interventional studies are warranted to assess modifiable factors that could be beneficial to enhance ED quality care."}
