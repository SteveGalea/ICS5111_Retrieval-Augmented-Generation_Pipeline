{"summary": "the virion journey in the extracellular space is an opportunity to interact with one of the most abundant molecules in that area: glycans. many proteins are expressed at the surface of eukaryotic cells or viruses that bind those glycans. some viruses have evolved to bind specific glycans in order to infect cells, like human rotaviruses binding to blood group A antigens. bioinformatics and databases are key to harnessing the potential for new knowledge discovery in virus and vaccine research. bioinformatics and databases are key to harnessing the potential for new knowledge discovery in virus and vaccine research. ViralZone [17] is a web resource that bridges sequence data to virus knowledge. it links to viral proteome sequences contained in UniProtKB [18], the Universal Protein Knowledgebase. most viruses use the host glycosylation machinery composed of enzymes. databases include the International Immuno-Genetics information system (IMGT) [26] and the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) [27]. more recently, a database of anti-glycan reagents (DAGR) [28] focused on anti-glycan antibodies was launched. the obvious advantage of mapping the resources in relation to virus cycle is to emphasize the potential for exploring knowledge via cross-references. neXtprot www.nextprot.org Integrated knowledge of human proteins Provides detailed functional information on human proteins Characterize human host surface receptors Partially curated 2009 [19] PDBe www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe 3D structures of proteins Describes chemical compounds interacting with viruses Explore the molecule formula of a given compound Curated 2004 [32] PubChem pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov Information lectins Describes glycan\u2013virus interactions Explore pathogen lectins/adhesins binding a glycan motif Curated 2005 [23] UniLectin3D www.unilectin.eu Carbohydrate-binding proteins (not Ab) Collects glycan\u2013virus interactions Inspect atomic details of glycan-haemagglutinin interactions Curated 2018 [25] IMGT www.imgt SugarBindDB reports the name found in the cited source is associated with several glycan binders. this article is cited as well in the cross-referenced Norwalk virus capsid protein VP1 entry of UniProtKB. UniLectin and SugarBindDB both cross-link to PDB entries associated with capsid protein VP1. glycan ligands proposed either in SugarBindDB or in UniLectin are matched to GlyConnect using GlyS3. the result is a list of full glycan structures containing the ligand substructures. most of these full structures are attached to mucins, some of which are linked to UniProtKB. ome sequences contained in UniProtKB [18], the Universal Protein Knowledgebase. knowledge of host glycoproteins and the glycans they carry is stored in GlyConnect [20] most viruses use the host glycosylation machinery composed of enzymes that are categorized in the CAZy database. a database of anti-glycan reagents (DAGR) [28] focused on anti-glycan antibodies was launched. a database of anti-glycan reagents (DAGR) [28] is currently devoid of any cross-reference to existing databases. the connectivity of databases is shown in Figure 2 where the renowned UniProtKB and Protein Data Bank (PDB) [29] obviously play a central role.

UniLectin and SugarBindDB both cross-link to PDB entries associated with capsid protein VP1. the result is a list of full glycan structures containing the ligand substructures. most of these full structures are attached to mucins, some of which are linked to UniProtKB. the reciprocal link between SugarBindDB and GlyTouCan opens many further lines of investigation. the reference was the first online repository put together by the US-based Consortium for Functional Glycomics (CFG) due to the discontinuation of funding, it is no longer updated and only temporarily maintained. Dedicated tools were also developed specifically for visualizing [39] or mining [37] the CFG array data. glycan array data yes 2014 [37] GLAD glycotoolkit.com/GLAD Visualization and analysis of glycan array data yes 2019 [38]. glycan array data yes 2014 [37] glycoPattern glycopattern.emory.edu Analysis of glycan array data yes 2019 [38]. most interactions stored in MatrixDB involve proteins and proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans. only one curated paper describes a GAG\u2013virus receptor interaction in MatrixDB. the table shown in Figure 4 will be refined to include links to MatrixDB. SugarBindDB and UniLectin are suitable connectors between virology, protein science, and chemical biology. this of course reflects the biological role of lectins as key players in cell\u2013cell communication. new viruses-related entries in SugarBindDB are slowly finding their way into the database due to the poor funding of biocuration. this raises the question of associating experts with the database development and is hardly a hidden invitation. the majority of interactions stored in MatrixDB involve proteins and proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans. only one curated paper describes a GAG\u2013virus receptor interaction between heparin and the Gibbon ape leukemia virus receptor 2 or sodium-dependent phosphate transporter 2 in MatrixDB. indDB and UniLectin are suitable connectors between virology, protein science, and chemical biology. this of course reflects the biological role of lectins as key players in cell\u2013cell communication. a full description of the situation may require further data from UniLectin. discussion Bioinformatics tools have become indispensable for processing and analyzing the now popular -omics data. a broad range of automated procedures are implemented to collect and piece together information from databases and support the formulation of new and testable hypotheses. glycobiology has developed a series of encoding formats that were attempts in a variety of ways to account for the branched structures. despite growing consensus in each community for relying on shared standards, cross-talk is not established between disciplines. glycans are prevalent molecules that offer a broad range of interplay with viruses crossing the extracellular space to infect new cells. bioinformatics resources are critical for the analysis of the diversity of available data."}
