{"summary": "Iota-Carrageenan nasal spray is widely active against respiratory viruses in-vitro and has an excellent safety profile. study investigated efficacy and safety of an Iota-Carrageenan nasal spray. the cochrane collaboration suggested to focus future research efforts on non virus-specific compounds. effective formulations containing antiviral agents are needed for the safe and efficacious treatment of common cold symptoms. potential side effects should also be minimal due to the usually nonhazardous nature of the indication. subjects were free to withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice to further treatment. symptoms were assessed on a 4 point scale: 0 = none, 1 = mild (sensible, but not disturbing or irritating), 2 = moderate (symptoms sometimes disturbing/irritating most of the time) subjects were excluded if a severe nasal septum deviation or other condition was present that could have caused nasal obstruction, such as nasal polyps or nasal/sinus surgery in the past. participants with a history of alcohol/substance abuse or on prescription medication/concomitant therapy other than for contraception were also excluded by the investigator. symptoms and application of treatment were documented in the patient diary. coding was performed by CRO Bioconsult GmbH (Perchtoldsdorf, Austria) study medication and dosing Iota-Carrageenan nasal sprays were identical in shape, size and colour to allow a double-blind design. one spray application of 140 l was delivered to each nostril 3 /day for 4 days. the next two applications of the spray were equally spaced through remaining waking hours on day 1. analysis of nasal lavages Nasal lavage was performed on day 1 (study inclusion) and on days 3 or 4. 8 parts lavage were mixed with 1 part 5% bovine albumin (Sigma Aldrich, Vienna, Austria) and 1 part 10 protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Germany) real time PCR analysis was performed for influenza virus type A + B, respiratory syncytial virus type A + B, parainfluenza virus types 1/2/3/4, coronavirus types 140 l samples were thawed on ice, transferred to 560 l Buffer AVL with carrier RNA, spiked with 10 l internal control, and eluated RNA was stored at -20\u00b0C for a maximum of 4 hours. RT-PCR reaction was performed in a final volume of 20 l. fluorescence was determined in a Luminex 100 reader and data analysed by Luminex software (Riverside CA, USA) the lower quantification limit was 3.2 pg/ml, values below were set to 'zero' study participants were excluded from the study for predefined reasons. subjects were also excluded if a severe nasal septum deviation or other condition was present that could have caused nasal obstruction. study was designed as a single centre randomised, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled comparative survey in subjects with early symptoms of common cold. randomization was done by providing a each test nasal spray with a unique code number. subjects completed a daily diary of common cold symptom scores over 7 days. the study protocol and attached documentation were approved by the responsible South East Wales Local Research Ethics Committee[15]. the signed study protocol was available to the journal editor during the reviewing process. verum and placebo nasal sprays were identical in shape, size and colour to allow a double-blind design. before administration, the spray was to be shaken and primed until a fine mist was delivered. analysis of nasal lavages was performed on day 1 (study inclusion) and on days 3 or 4. Samples were collected by instillation of 5 ml of 0.9% sterile saline into each nostril. 8 parts lavage were mixed with 1 part 5% bovine albumin (Sigma Aldrich, Vienna, Austria) and 1 part 10 protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Germany) the ct values of all positive samples from the first visit were anti-logged on the basis of 2. the relative quantity of virus positive samples at the second visit was calculated in percent of the value of the first visit. the lower quantification limit was 3.2 pg/ml, values below were set to 'zero' the lower quantification limit was 3.2 pg/ml, values below were set to 'zero' study endpoints based on symptoms End point Carrageenan nasal spray n = 14 Placebo nasal spray n = 18 p-value Primary endpoint TSS mean of sum on days 2-4 4.62 2,06 6.28 2.29 0.046 Secondary endpoints LSS mean of sum on days 2-4 3.79 2,03 5.22 2.30 0.068 SSS mean of sum on days 2-4 0.83 0,75 1.06 1,07 0.704. average individual symptoms scores blocked nose, runny nose, cough, and sneezing were higher for placebo when compared to verum. the individual symptoms blocked nose, runny nose, cough, and sneezing were higher for placebo when compared to verum. in the placebo group only 36.4% of subjects were free of this symptom. samples of 6 Iota-Carrageenan and 5 placebo patients were virus positive. 5 patients tested positive for human rhinovirus, another 5 for coronavirus, and one for parainfluenza 3 virus. otaxin, GM-CSF, IFN-, IL-12(p70), IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, MCP-3, MDC, MIP-1, MIP-1, sCD40L, sIL-2R, TNF-, TNF-, and VEGF were found to be present in the highest concentration of all tested cytokines Iota-Carrageenan Placebo p-value FGF-2 5.9 (5.9) 2.5 (2.8) 7.5 (5.6) 0.04 Fractalkine 87.0 (74.5) 46.4 (32.4) 79.7 (39.3) 0.023 GRO 252 (233) 156 (112) 339 (417) n.s.

Iota-Carrageenan nasal spray appears to be a promising compound for safe and effective treatment of early symptoms of common cold. larger clinical trials are needed to study the therapeutic index in more detail. authors EPG, AGR, CME, and RWE are employed by Marinomed. ct values of 35 - 40 indicative for minimal amounts of target viral nucleic acid, cts 30 - 35 for moderate amounts, cts 30 mark strong positive reactions. comparison verum versus placebo by Mann-Whitney U-test."}
