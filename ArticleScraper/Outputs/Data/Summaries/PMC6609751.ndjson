{"summary": "the cluster of 6 acute respiratory infections due to adenovirus in the swimming department of a physical education school (School J) was reported to Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. an epidemiological investigation was conducted to identify the transmission route of the infection and to control the outbreak. the adenovirus (HAdV-B55) is a double-stranded DNA virus. it is divided into seven species by DNA homology and has more than 70 serotypes. the most common infection due to HAdV is pharyngitis. the cluster of acute respiratory infections due to adenovirus in the swimming department of a physical education school (School J) was reported to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). epidemiological investigation was conducted to identify the transmission route of the infection and to control the outbreak. a retrospective cohort investigation was conducted on 59 students and teachers who had been using the swimming pool (swimming and modern sports) since 22 May prospective active surveillance has been conducted for all students and school personnel to detect additional cases. 20 and 22, and adenovirus PCR tests were conducted on 59 samples collected from the swimming pool water, surface of the swimming pool environment, and the surface of the dormitory environment. more than one liter of swimming pool water was collected and concentrated using concentration method (InnovaPrep\u00ae Concentrating Pipette) before PCR tests. the total school population was 395, consisting of 322 students and 73 teachers. each student is a member of one of the16 athletic departments. each student is a member of one of the 16 athletic departments. adenovirus PCR tests were conducted on 59 samples collected from the swimming pool water, surface of the swimming pool environment, and the surface of the dormitory environment. more than one liter of swimming pool water was collected and concentrated using concentration method (InnovaPrep\u00ae Concentrating Pipette) the first confirmed cases occurred on may 13. from may 13 to may 17, there was an increasing trend in the incidence of cases. on may 15, the most confirmed cases occurred. 15 (32.6%) of all cases were hospitalized due to acute respiratory infection. none of the cases showed signs of pneumonia. adenovirus respiratory infection cases were accompanied by vomiting or diarrhea. bChronic rhinitis (5), arrhythmia (1). cTonsillectomy (3), surgery for nasal septum (1). cTonsillectomy (3). cTonsillectomy (3). surgery for nasal septum (1). b, number. 3. Comparison of attack rates In Study 1, attack rate of the swimming department was higher than that of others (RR: 1.90; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01-3.60) 0.001 Others 296 5 1.7 Ref High incidence athletic department Shooting 21 6 28.6 12.18 4.65\u201331.88 0.001 Others 341 8 2.3 Ref Sharing the dormitory room with the case before the symptom onset Yes 51 5 9.8 3.39 1.18\u20139.70 0.03 No 311 9 2.9 Ref N, number; AR, attack rate; RR, relative risk; CI, confidence interval; +, Fisher's exact test using two-tailed P-value the sequence was 100% identical in homology and the type was confirmed to be HAdV B-55. no adenovirus was detected in the pool water and the surfaces of locker rooms and shower rooms where frequent contacts happen. a total of 33 cases were identified, of which 12 were confirmed cases and 21 were suspected cases. none of the asymptomatic cases tested positive for adenovirus. the first suspected case occurred on April 24. he was the first grade high school student (15 years old) and a member of the modern sports department. the common symptoms in 47 cases were headache (33, 71.7%), fever (32, 69.6%), rhinorrhea (29, 63.0%), sputum (26, 56.5%), and sore throat (25, 54.3%). none of the cases showed signs of pneumonia, but 15 (32.6%) of all cases were hospitalized due to acute respiratory infection. hospitalization Yes 15 32.6 8 44.4 7 24.1 No 32 69.6 10 55.6 22 75.9 Underlying disease Yes 6b 12.8 1 5.6 5 17.2 No 41 87.2 17 94.4 24 82.8 History of any medical surgery in the past Yes 4c 8.5 0 0.0 4 13.8 No 43 91.5 18 100.0 25 86.2 aInfluenza A (1) and, B (1). bChronic rhinitis (5), arrhythmia (1). onset Yes 39 17 43.6 0.73 0.50\u20131.07 0.14 No 20 16 80.0 Ref Prospective surveillance of the entire members of the physical education school (Study 2) Overall 362 14 3.9 - - - High incidence grade of the school High school 1st grade 66 9 13.6 8.07 2.80\u2013 23.31 0.001 Others 296 5 1.7 Ref High incidence athletic department Shooting 21 6 28.6 12.18 4.65\u2013 31.88 0.001 Others 341 two of the confirmed cases were co-detected with influenza virus. no adenovirus but influenza virus was detected from a student among those with fever and respiratory symptoms. the student was not included in the cases. a total of 47 suspected cases of acute respiratory infection caused by adenovirus were identified in a physical education school in 2017. the gene analysis on the adenoviruses showed that the sequence was 100% identical in homology and the type was confirmed to be HAdV B-55. the study is the first to report on the outbreak of HAdV B-55 acute respiratory infection in communities, except military camps. respiratory infection caused by adenovirus (2-14 days) [2,3] was initiated in student of the modern sports department using the swimming pool, spread in the swimming department, and transmitted to other students who were not using the swimming pool. sharing a dormitory room was assumed to have contributed to the transmission of the infection, but it was not identified as an independent risk factor. Approximately 44.4% of confirmed cases were hospitalized. this was lower than the rate reported in the military (62.0%) [20]. this study had several limitations: first, selection bias could occur. epidemiological characteristics of HAdV B-55 will be the basis for further research."}
