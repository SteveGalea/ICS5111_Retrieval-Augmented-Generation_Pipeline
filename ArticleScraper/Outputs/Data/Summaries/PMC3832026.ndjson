{"summary": "the agnoprotein\u2013AP3D interaction was confirmed using GST-AP3D recombinant proteins (AP3D-Y27, AP3D-Y27N, and AP3D-Y27C) no interactions were seen with agnoprotein with GST alone or with GST-AP3D-Y27N. the interaction was confirmed in mammalian cells using immunoprecipitation methods. agnoprotein binds to AP3D and impairs AP-3\u2013mediated vesicular trafficking. agnoprotein binds to AP3D and impairs AP-3\u2013mediated vesicular trafficking. GST pull-down assay with the GST-AP3D-Y27C and in vitro synthesized agnoprotein deletion mutant (C6, C18, and C25) after incubation with in vitro synthesized agnoprotein, the GST fusion proteins were precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose and bead-bound proteins were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-agnoprotein Ab (Top) lysine residues at position 9 (Lys-9) of JCV agnoprotein are critical for AP3D binding. AP3D is involved in the biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles (20) some lysosomal membrane proteins, including Lamp-1, exhibit increased trafficking to the plasma membrane. VSVG-GFP signal in perinuclear region was still evident at 180 min. agnoprotein inhibited transport of VSVG-GFP between the ER and the TGN. inhibition of AP3D could be rescued by overexpression of AP3D. nascent protein synthesis in cells with HygB was quantified by labeling newly synthesized proteins with Alexa Fluor 488. the levels of nascent protein synthesis were relatively unaltered in SVG-RK8AA cells. SVG-AG cells stably expressing partial fragments of AP3D (Y27N or Y27C) or empty vector (Mock) were incubated with or without DOX. the cells were stained with FM1-43FX dye. agnoprotein binds to AP3D and suppresses AP-3\u2013mediated vesicular trafficking. agnoprotein inhibits AP-3 function and this leads to an enhancement of viroporin activity by agnoprotein itself. cell membrane permeability for FM1-43FX dye with siAP3D was markedly increased compared with a negative control (siNC) the increase of membrane permeability for FM1-43FX dye with siAP3D was also observed with the RK8AA mutant (Fig. 2F, right), suggesting that the interaction of agnoprotein with AP3D is not necessary. surface was less than 30% of WT (Fig. S7D) surface was less than 30% of WT (Fig. S7D) surface was incubated with or without DOX for indicated time points. the cells were subjected to confocal microscopy analysis. the colocalization of RK8AA was decreased in the cells transfected with siAP3D. agnoprotein was significantly higher with siAP3D treatment in both WT and RK8AA mutant agnoprotein-expressing cells. the levels of agnoprotein in cells with siAP3D quickly reached a maximum after induction with DOX (Fig. S9A) the levels of agnoprotein in cells with siAP3D were more stable. AP-3\u2013mediated vesicular trafficking transports agnoprotein to the lysosome for degradation. lysates were collected at the indicated time and subjected to immunoblotting. cells were cultured in the presence of a mixture of lysosome protease inhibitors (LPI) for 48 h. WT disrupts AP-3\u2013mediated vesicular trafficking, is translocated to plasma membrane, and functions as a viroporin. agnoprotein is transported and degraded in lysosomes in an AP-3\u2013dependent mechanism. lysosomes can carry both the WT and RK8AA mutant of agnoprotein. agnoprotein binds to AP3D and disrupts AP-3\u2013mediated vesicular trafficking. this is instead transported to the lysosomes with subsequent lysosomal degradation. agnoprotein, but not RK8AA mutant, enhances plasma membrane permeability. agnoprotein binds to AP3D and impairs AP-3\u2013mediated vesicular trafficking. aliquots from lysates applied to the pull-down experiments were also subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-agnoprotein antibody. 293AG (WT) or 293RK8AA (RK8AA) cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-agnoprotein Ab (IP:Agno), followed by immunoblotting with anti-AP3D and anti-agnoprotein antibodies. aliquots from mixtures before pull-down experiment subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-agnoprotein (Middle) or GST (Bottom) antibody. DSRed represents DSRed expression in nuclei as a marker of transfection. the BKV agnoprotein differs from JCV in that it has a Gln-9 instead of Lys-9. lysine residues at position 9 (Lys-9) of AP3D are critical for AP3D binding. the transport of VSVG-GFP from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to the cell surface requires AP3D (22) the 293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding VSVG-GFP and agnoprotein. in the absence of agnoprotein, VSVG-GFP was transported to the plasma membrane and was only minimally detected in the perinuclear region at 180 min. SVG-AG and SVG-RK8AA cells were incubated with or without DOX for 72 h. nascent protein synthesis in cells with HygB was quantified by labeling newly synthesized proteins with Alexa Fluor 488. SVG-AG cells (WT) are wild type of agnoprotein-inducible cells with DOX treatment, or SVG-RK8AA cells (RK8AA) mutants of agnoprotein-inducible cells with DOX treatment were incubated with or without DOX. cells were stained with FM1-43FX dye. cells were harvested and lysed at 5 d after infection (WCL) culture supernatants were collected simultaneously and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-VP1, anti-agnoprotein, anti-actin antibodies. agnoprotein binds to AP3D and suppresses AP-3\u2013mediated vesicular trafficking. agnoprotein inhibits AP-3 function and this leads to an enhancement of viroporin activity by agnoprotein itself. agnoprotein is in part cotranslationally inserted into the ER membrane. the RK8AA mutant localized predominantly in the perinuclear region. the mutant was poorly expressed on the cell surface at 48 h. overall, the expression on the cell surface was less than 30% of WT. confocal microscopy analysis of SVG-RK8AA cells showed the colocalization of agnoprotein with Lamp-2, the lysosome marker. the cells were transfected with siAP3D or siNC compared with siNC. the number of agnoprotein granules was significantly increased in RK8AA-expressing cells at 48 h and 72 h after DOX induction. the granules of RK8AA mutant, but not WT, were well colocalized with Lamp-2, the lysosomal marker protein (Fig. 3D and Fig. S8A) agnoprotein was degraded by the pathway involving the AP-3 complex. the levels of agnoprotein were seen to decrease in a time-dependent manner following washing out of DOX (DOX w/o) in cells transfected with siNC. agnoprotein in cells with siAP3D were more stable. agnoprotein and lysosome marker Lamp-2 were processed for immunofluorescence staining and analyzed by confocal microscopy. a model to illustrate the involvement of AP-3 in membrane permeabilization and virion release. both WT and RK8AA form homooligomers as integral membrane proteins in cytoplasmic organelles. lysosomes can carry both the WT and RK8AA mutant of agnoprotein. these studies show that agnoprotein is transported and degraded in lysosomes in an AP-3\u2013dependent mechanism. both agnoprotein and agnoprotein are integral membrane proteins in the cytoplasmic organelles. a second population is translocated to lysosomes dependent on AP-3 but without binding with AP3D. a third population reaches the plasma membrane to function as an oligomeric viroporin. this binding capacity was lost in the RK8AA mutant agnoprotein. agnoprotein was not transported to the cell surface immediately after translation. the signal sequence-dependent protein sorting usually occurs soon after translation without a significant time lag. however, transport of agnoprotein to the cell surface may not depend on the signal sequences of agnoprotein. stably expressing myc-tagged AP3D-Y27N or AP3D-Y27C were grown to 50% confluence on a six-well plate and incubated with 1,000 HA units of JCV. the whole-cell lysates and culture supernatants were harvested and analyzed by immunoblot analysis at indicated times after infection. click-iT AHA is an amino acid analog of methionine containing an azide moiety. the amino acid is incorporated into proteins during active protein synthesis. the cells were incubated for 72 h in 100 M Click-iT AHA. Alexa Fluor 488 corresponding to nascent protein syntheses in single cells was analyzed using cell Scoring Application Module of MetaMorph software. the bar graph indicates the proportion of mean signal intensity of Alexa Fluor 488 of the cells in the presence of HygB compared with those in the absence of HygB. mutant and WT viral DNA were linearized at the Bam HI site. equal amounts of viral DNA were transfected into permissive SVG-A cells by Fugene HD (Roche Diagnostics) reagents. agnoprotein-expressing cells were seeded in 96-well plates with or without DOX. the cells were incubated for 72 h in 100 M Click-iT AHA containing medium with or without 500 g/mL HygB. cells stained with lipophilic dye FM1-43FX in HBSS without magnesium or calcium. cells were then washed with ice-cold PBS and fixed for 30 min in ice-cold 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde."}
