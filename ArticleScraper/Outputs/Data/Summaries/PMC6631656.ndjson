{"summary": "the united States-Japan Cooperative Medical Sciences Program (USJCMSP) was formed under a joint communiqu\u00e9 issued by U.S. president Lyndon B. Johnson and japan Prime Minister Eisaku Sato in 1965. this focus has evolved over time to reflect changing public health issues in the region. the current nine panels focus on acute respiratory infections (ARI); acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); 3) cancer; 4) cholera and other bacterial enteric infections; 5) hepatit hen Third People\u2019s Hospital and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) Institute of Microbiology. this report summarizes the presentations (including the latest progress and gaps from the various fields of research), discussion, and conclusions of the conference. four longstanding champions of the USJCMSP have attended the conference. the conference began with two lectureships in honor of four longstanding champions of the USJCMSP. to study the response of the intestinal epithelium to human gastrointestinal infections, such as rotavirus and norovirus. this could lead to a better understanding of human host-pathogen interactions, including innate immune responses, and potentially to identifying and testing new drug therapies. five plenary sessions focused on the pathogenesis and protective immunity of viral diseases that are of priority in the region and have global health importance. this session aimed to review some of the important new, long-time, and re-emerging infectious viral threats in Asia. the distribution of dengue is widespread and inflicts a high medical and cost burden. there has been a shift in the epidemiology, with infections and disease moving to rural areas. increased tick activity has been observed during the Eid festival, which coincides with backyard slaughter of animals. increased tick activity has been observed during the festival, which coincides with backyard slaughter of animals. antigen (HLA)-B57 and HLA-B27 haplotypes are associated with the control of HIV-1 viremia and disease progression in Caucasian and african populations. the research team found that HLA-B52:01 and HLA-C12:02 are associated with significantly lower HIV-1 viral loads and increased CD4 cell counts. the natural killer cell receptor, killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) 2DL2, may also contribute to the control of HIV-1 in Japanese session on hepatitis virus infection and liver cancer provided a research update on: molecular virology and immunology of HBV; host factors related to hepatitis virus infection; the genetic landscape of virus-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); integrated genomics to identify drivers of human liver cancers. randomized clinical trials are being conducted to study new treatment strategies for chronic HBV infection involving nucleotide analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors. liver cancer, including cholangiocarcinoma, is the second leading cause of cancer death. etiological factors associated with HCC include infection with HBV and exposure to high levels of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) in the diet. the development of highly effective drugs that cure HCV infection is a major advance that, hopefully, will diminish the role of HCV in liver cancer. the global disease burden of RSV and the need for more than one RSV vaccine to target different age populations were described. the epidemiological baseline of HFMD caused by multiple serotypes of enterovirus in china and the implications for vaccine development were discussed. the 2016 USJCMSP Collaborative Awards initiative supports new or expanded infectious disease and immunology research collaborations. the initiative also promotes and facilitates the inclusion of early-stage and female investigators in collaborative research in the region. one rest day (closure) in poultry markets has a significant impact in reducing virus persistence and transmission of the virus through aerosols in poultry handling and de-feathering areas. the reported cases of H7N9 influenza underestimates the extent of human infection, and the effect of vaccination needs to be further studied. chikungunya and dengue virus infections can provide insight into ZIKV infection in the u.s. several studies have failed to provide evidence of immune enhancement, although the question remains if dengue virus immunity affects ZIKV infection. a talk focused on the EV71 carrying VP1-145E variants. this suggests the involvement of amino acid polymorphism at VP1-145 in cell-specific viral replication, in vivo fitness, and pathogenesis in EV71-infected individuals. ser267Phe (S267F) variant of NTCP is inversely associated with HBV pathogenesis and cirrhosis. dengue 2 antibody levels appear to determine susceptibility to ZIKV infection with high dengue 2 titers being protective. lower titers enhance infection. this session included a discussion of host factors related to hepatitis virus infection using a genome-wide association study. a genetic analysis using GWAS identified host factors for various human multifactorial diseases, as well as interferon (IFN) lambda for drug response, and HLA II genes for susceptibility to chronic HBV infection (CHB) Session 4 focused on vaccines, with seven presentations on current state and future landscape of vaccine development, technology, promising candidates, and clinical outcomes for prominent viral infectious diseases. dengue, ZIKV, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, HIV/AIDS, influenza virus, hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) and chikungunya. session focused on identification of correlates of protection, evaluation of vaccine candidates in immunocompromised populations, antibody enhancements, and the stability of attenuation in vaccine strains. session included three presentations that addressed new approaches to define protective immunity. the first presentation focused on the threat of avian influenza A H7N9 virus, which currently causes zoonotic infections that are mostly acquired in live bird markets. the reported cases of H7N9 influenza underestimate the extent of human infection, and the effect of vaccination needs to be further studied. endemic prevalence of hepatitis viruses in Mongolia is about 12 times the global average. there is no evidence that primates are intermediates of transmission. chikungunya and dengue virus infections can provide insight into ZIKV infection in the Americas. the evolution of urban transmission was also considered. es, exoribonuclease (ExoN) plays a key role in maintaining a low mutational rate for the virus. a talk focused on the EV71 carrying VP1-145E variants. this further suggested the involvement of amino acid polymorphism at VP1-145 in cell-specific viral replication, in vivo fitness, and pathogenesis. reovirus reverse genetic system was established by transfecting the cell via plasmids. each coding a segment of reovirus genome was discussed. ser267Phe variant of NTCP is inversely associated with HBV pathogenesis and cirrhosis. liver cancer, including cholangiocarcinoma, is the second leading cause of cancer death (about 9.1% of total cancer deaths) liver cancer, including cholangiocarcinoma, is the second leading cause of cancer death (about 9.1% of total cancer deaths) ongoing clinical investigations are defining the utility of GPC3, a cell surface proteoglycan differentially expressed in HCC, and other promising antibody therapeutics to treat liver cancer. Session 4 focused on vaccines, with seven presentations on the current state and future landscape of vaccine development. chikungunya: a presentation described the versatility and advantages of a measles vector vaccine platform and the phase 2 clinical safety and immunogenicity of a measles-vectored chikungunya vaccine. sessions focused on identification of correlates of protection; evaluation of vaccine candidates in immunocompromised populations; antibody enhancements; and stability of attenuation in vaccine strains.
