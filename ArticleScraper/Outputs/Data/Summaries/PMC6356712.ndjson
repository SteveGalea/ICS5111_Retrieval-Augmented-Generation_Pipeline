{"summary": "introduction middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a lineage C beta-coronavirus, was reported to cause severe respiratory tract infection. to date, 2266 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 804 associated deaths, have been reported to the world health organization (WHO) from 27 countries. ying et al. identified a human neutralizing monoclonal antibody (hmAb), m336, which is specific for the RBD in the S protein S1 subunit. it exhibited highly potent neutralizing activity against MERS-CoV infection, both in vitro and in vivo. however, the future clinical application of m336 could be limited by its inability to neutralize MERS-CoV strains with mutations in RBD. 293T cells were plated in a tissue culture flask and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 16 h. plasmids pNL4-3.luc.RE encoding Env-defective, luciferase-expressing HIV-1 and pcDNA3.1-MERS-CoV-S encoding S protein with or without mutations in RBD. the supernatant was replaced with fresh DMEM at 8\u201310 h post-transfection and harvested after incubation for an additional 72 h. the supernatant was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min, followed by filtration through a 0.45 m filter. plasmid pAAV-IRES-MERS-EGFP was transfected into 293T cells (293T/MERS/EGFP) using the transfection reagent, VigoFect (Vigorous Biotechnology, Beijing, China) the target Huh-7 cells expressing DPP4 were incubated at 2 104 cells/well in wells of a 96-well plate for 12 h. Huh-7 cells were co-cultured with 293T/EGFP cells or 293T/MERS/EGFP cells in the presence of PBS (middle) or 10 M HR2P-M2 peptide at 37 \u00b0C for 2h. the unfused cells were counted under a fluorescence microscope. 2.6. Inhibitor Combination Assay To assess potential synergistic effect, HR2P-M2 and m336 were mixed at the indicated molar concentration ratio. HR2P-M2 alone and m336 alone were included as controls. each sample was tested in triplicate, and data were analyzed. h-7 cell line was from the Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China) these two cell lines were propagated in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) the supernatant was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min, followed by filtration through a 0.45 m filter. plasmid pAAV-IRES-MERS-EGFP encoding the MERS-CoV S protein was transfected into 293T cells (293T/MERS/EGFP) the target Huh-7 cells expressing DPP4were incubated at 2 104 cells/well in wells of a 96-well plate for 12 h. effector 293T/MERS/EGFP cells express EGFP or control 293T/MERS/EGFP cells that express EGFP were preincubated at 104 cells/wells. the mixture of 293T/MERS/EGFP cells and an inhibitor or PBS were added to Huh-7 cells in the wells, followed by a co-culture at 37 \u00b0C for 2 h. the fused cell showed much larger size and weaker fluorescence intensity than the six-week-old female specific-pathogen-free mice were divided into 3 groups of 3 mice each. Mice were sedated with Nembutal (100 mg/kg body weight) before and 2 h after injection of the inhibitors. CI values of 1 and >1 indicate synergy and antagonism, respectively. synergy was divided into different strengths according to CI values. combining HR2P-M2 and m336 resulted in strong synergistic inhibitory activity against MERS-CoV pseudovirus infection with CI values of 0.13\u20130.20. this result suggested that the MERS-CoV fusion inhibitory peptide HR2P-M2 and the MERS-CoV neutralizing mAb m336 could be used in combination to enhance anti-MERS-CoV activity. molar concentration of HR2P-M2 and m336 in combination is 10,000:1. 3.2. we adjusted the molar concentration ratio of HR2P-M2 and m336 in the combination to 4500:1. the combination also exhibited strong synergism against MERS-CoV S protein-mediated cell\u2013cell fusion. molar concentration ratio of HR2P-M2 and m336 in combination is 4500:1. MERS-CoV pseudoviruses with mutations in RBD are resistant to the neutralizing activity of an RBD-specific mouse mAb Mersmab1. the neutralizing activity of m336 is about 2- to 8-fold. the pseudoviruses with or without mutations were equally sensitive to fusion inhibitory activity of HR2P-M2. each sample was tested in triplicate. combination of m336 and HR2P-M2 exhibited synergistic antiviral activity against infection by pseudotyped MERS-CoV strains with or without mutations in the RBD or HR1 domain. we then tested their sensitivity to the inhibition of HR2P-M2 alone, m336 alone, and the HR2P-M2/m336 combination. one in Mixture Enhancement Alone in Mixture Enhancement Wild type 50 0.197 0.574 0.069 8.36 0.066 0.005 12.94 60 0.183 0.874 0.097 9.05 0.099 0.007 13.88 70 0.168 1.381 0.140 9.87 0.155 0.010 14.98 80 0.152 2.415 0.220 10.96 0.268 0.016 16.44 90 0.131 5.598 0.436 12.85 0.610 0.032 18.92 D509G in R sera from Mice Treated with the m336/HR2P-M2 Combination showed more Efficacy in Inhibiting MERS-CoV Pseudovirus Infection than Either HR2P-M2 or m336 alone. the molar concentration ratio of HR2P-M2 and m336 in combination against wildtype virus is 10,000:1, 4500:1, and 10,000:1, respectively. the inhibitory activity detected in sera was significantly higher than that detected in sera from mice treated with HR2P-M2 or m336 alone. this result confirms that combining HR2P-M2 with m336 affords synergism against MERS-CoV S infection, both in vitro and in vivo. in Figure 2 and Table 1, combining HR2P-M2 and m336 resulted in strong synergistic inhibitory activity against MERS-CoV pseudovirus infection. this result suggested that the MERS-CoV fusion inhibitory peptide HR2P-M2 and the MERS-CoV neutralizing mAb m336 could be used in combination to enhance anti-MERS-CoV activity. molar concentration of HR2P-M2 and m336 in combination is 10,000:1. 3.2. combining HR2P-M2 with m336 Displayed Strong Synergism against MERS-CoV S protein-mediated cell\u2013cell fusion. the combination also exhibited strong synergism against MERS-CoV S protein-mediated cell\u2013cell fusion. in Mixture Enhancement Alone in Mixture Enhancement 50 0.271 0.511 0.110 4.64 0.440 0.024 17.96 60 0.274 0.713 0.156 4.57 0.625 0.035 18.04 70 0.278 1.025 0.228 4.50 0.918 0.051 18.12 80 0.282 1.596 0.362 4.41 1.466 0.080 18.22 90 0.288 3.106 0.726 2.965 0.161 18.38. activity of m336 is about 2- to 8-fold, whereas the pseudoviruses with or without mutations were equally sensitive to fusion inhibitory activity of HR2P-M2. this result suggested that use of mAb m336 alone is unable to control the infection by MERS-CoV strains with mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) separately. 0.05 and p 0.01 were considered statistically significant and very significant respectively. combined m336 with HR2P-M2 Exhibited Potent Synergism against MERS-CoV Pseudoviruses with or without mutations in RBD or in the HR1 domain. we then tested their sensitivity to the inhibition of HR2P-M2 alone, m336 alone, and the HR2P-M2/m336 combination. ture Enhancement Alone in Mixture Enhancement Wild type 50 0.197 0.574 0.069 8.36 0.066 0.005 12.94 60 0.183 0.874 0.097 9.05 0.099 0.007 13.88 70 0.168 1.381 0.140 9.87 0.155 0.010 14.98 80 0.152 2.415 0.220 10.96 0.268 0.016 16.44 90 0.131 5.598 0.436 12.85 0.610 0.032 18.92 D509G in RBD 50 sera from Mice Treated with the m336/HR2P-M2 Combination showed more Efficacy in Inhibiting MERS-CoV Pseudovirus Infection than Either HR2P-M2 or m336 alone. the molar concentration ratio of HR2P-M2 and m336 in combination against wildtype virus is 10,000:1, 4500:1, and 10,000:1, respectively. the inhibitory activity detected in sera was significantly higher than that detected in sera from mice treated with HR2P-M2 or m336 alone. this result confirms that combining HR2P-M2 with m336 affords synergism against MERS-CoV S infection, both in vitro and in vivo. anti-MERS-CoV activity of HR2P-M2 alone and m336 alone was significantly more potent than either one administered alone against MERS-CoV S protein-mediated cell\u2013cell fusion and MERS-CoV pseudovirus infection. drug synergism can be expected when drugs that act by different mechanisms of action are mixed together [22] the HR2P-M2/m336 combination exhibited strong synergistic antiviral activity against all pseudotyped MERS-CoV strains compared to HR2P-M2 or m336 alone. the strong synergy of the combination is expected to reduce the dosage of the individual inhibitor in such combinational therapy."}
