{"summary": "the link between the bite of a mad dog and the risk of human death has been well recognized. domestic dog remains to this day by far the most important species causing human rabies deaths. the need for and feasibility of rabies elimination through interventions in the dog population has also been recognized for more than a century. the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) emerged as the main rabies reservoir in Europe. over 25 years, oral vaccination of foxes has resulted in the elimination of the rabies virus from western Europe. rabies research efforts focused on development of oral rabies vaccines and vaccination strategies for wildlife. research into the control of canine rabies in LMICs received only limited attention during the latter part of the twentieth century. but this resulted in a deficit of data and understanding of the burden and scale of the disease in poorer parts of the world. reliable data have been lacking on the number of dog-mediated human rabies deaths in africa widely recognized to be major underestimate. from 54 100 deaths (95% CI 32 400\u2013103 400) in 1990, 26 400 (95% CI 15 200\u201345 200) in 2010, 23 500 (95% CI 17 300\u201328 600) in 2013, and 13 300 in 2016 (95% CI 7200\u201319 100) rabies, there is no evidence that control measures have been implemented on a scale that would explain the dramatic recent decline in deaths indicated by the GBD estimates. the region is on the brink of eliminating canine-mediated human rabies as a result of relatively modest investments in mass dog vaccination ($61 million) these data contribute to a growing body of evidence that the most cost-effective preventive strategies are those underpinned by mass dog vaccination rather than reliance on PEP alone. other host species (humans, livestock and wildlife) may be infected as a result of spillover transmission from dogs but cannot sustain cycles of infection independently. the basic reproductive number, R0 is typically between 1 and 2 in populations that differ in density by an order of magnitude. alternative approaches to estimating transmission are consistent with this low value of R0 [29,36,38,39] suggesting that rabies should be easily controlled through mass dog vaccination. canine rabies has been brought under control or eliminated even though rabies variants circulate in wild mammal populations. overlapping circulation of multiple variants does, however, introduce different surveillance requirements for verifying the elimination of the canine rabies variant. in the serengeti ecosystem, Tanzania, inference from epidemiological and genetic data supports the idea of rabies being maintained in domestic dogs not wildlife. the last decade has seen a rapid expansion of research into canine rabies vaccination and canine rabies elimination (figure 1). the health and economic benefits would be substantial [22] (figure 2). reducing population turnover could help sustain population immunity between campaigns and improve cost-effectiveness. achieving a 70% coverage during annual campaigns has been sufficient to sustain population immunity above critical thresholds determined by R0 [70]. practice is being found to improve rabies diagnosis in settings with limited laboratory infrastructure. these have great potential for empowering field staff to engage in rabies surveillance and respond more effectively to surveillance data. but even simple technologies such as mobile phones can serve as leapfrogging technology that can dramatically improve the extent and resolution of rabies surveillance data. analysis of rabies surveillance and control data indicates that vaccination coverage implemented during campaigns is often patchy and that time to rabies elimination is prolonged. disparities between theory and practice demand approaches that capture realism. rabies research as a driver of policy change has contributed pivotal evidence in making the case for rabies to be considered a priority NTD. in 2012, rabies was included in the world health organization (WHO) Accelerated Roadmap for NTDs. intervention that effectively reduce the force of infection from the animal reservoir convey benefits to all without regard to socioeconomic status. social, political and economic factors constraining access to healthcare are likely to prevail, with rabies deaths continuing to affect the most disadvantaged communities well beyond 2030. this approach can lead to neglect of the problem at source\u2014in the dogs\u2014and impede progress towards large-scale mass dog vaccination programmes. interests S.C. and K.H. received support for rabies research and dog vaccination campaigns in the Serengeti ecosystem, Tanzania. funding was supported by the Agriculture and Food Research Council, the DfID Animal Health Programme, the Wellcome Trust and the NIH/NSF Ecology of Infectious Diseases Program."}
