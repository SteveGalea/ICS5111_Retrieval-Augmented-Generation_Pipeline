{"summary": "21 million cases of dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF)/dengue shock syndrome (DSS) occur every year, resulting in 21 000 deaths. there are four DENV serotypes (DENV1\u20134), which are closely related. initial infection with a particular serotype is known as primary infection, which is usually asymptomatic or results in mild disease manifestations. the majority of individuals infected with the dengue virus do not develop a severe immunopathology. identification of serotype-specific memory T cell responses would help us to determine whether the number of past infecting DENVs, the sequence of infection with different serotypes and the quality and quantity of serotype-specific T cell responses. we identified serotype specific T cell epitopes in highly conserved regions of the four DENV serotypes in naturally exposed healthy DENV-immune donors from Sri Lanka. we found that individuals with previous DI had a high frequency of memory T cell responses to serotype-specific conserved peptides of DENV. however, DENV-4 has been thought previously to be responsible for only 5% of all acute DIs in Sri Lanka [14],[15]. serotypes (taxonomy i.d. 12637) were downloaded from NCBI. the protein sequences were used to construct two databases [16] for each serotype. one contained only the serotype-specific proteins and a second contained all proteins from the flaviviridae (taxonomy i.d. 11050) excluding that serotype's proteins. conservation of polyprotein regions across members of the serogroups was confirmed using FUZZ LKTEVTNPAV PTTEIQLTDYGALT PTSEIQLTDYGALT VLVQIKYEGT VLVQVKYEGT SRWSRKMLMTGTLAVFFLLI GTLAVFFLLIMGQLTWNDLI AVFFLLIMGQLTWNDLI KMRPMFAVGLLFRR SLVASVELPNSLEELGDGLAMGIMI LTDFQSHQLWATLLSLTFIK ATLLSLTFIK TTFSL PEIEDDIFR LTLNLITEMGRLPTFMTQKARD MTLGMCCIITASILLWYAQIQPH LGSIATQQQPESNI SRLNALGKSEFQI RYKKATYEP NIGIESEIPNLDIIGKRIEKIKQEHETS KELGKKKTPRM FKSIQHLTITEEIAVQNWLARVGR 3 SNMLSIINQRKKTSLCLMMILPAAL ILALFLAHYIG EVK RDVNKEKVVGRVISSTPLAE NTNSVT VITLCAIILGGLTWMDLLRA WMDLLRALIMLGDTMSGRIG TALMVIGMAMTTTLSIPHDL AMTTVLSIPHDLMELIDGIS AMTTVLSIPHDLMELIDGIS IVTQFDNTQVGTLA IMAVLFVVTLIPLCRTSCLQSHWVEI TNMITLLVKLALITVSGLYP LAIPVTMTL all peptides that induced an IFN- response of more than mean 3 standard deviations (s.d.) of the irrelevant peptide were considered positive. ex-vivo ELISPOT assays were performed as described previously in 24 dengue-immune donors and five dengue seronegative donors. isothiocyanate (FITC)], anti-CD4 [peridinin chlorophyll (PerCP)] and anti-CD8 [phycoerythrin (PE) were then stained for intracellular IFN-[allophycocyanin (APC) according to manufacturer's instructions. all PBMC and B cell lines were HLA-typed by polymerase chain reaction\u2013sequence-specific primers (PCR\u2013SSP) phototyping. murine fibroblast cell lines were initially pulsed with 100 l of 40 M peptide for 1 h at 37\u00b0C, in 5% CO2. then washed three times in RPMI-1640 plus 10% FCS and used as antigen-presenting cells to washed T cells harvested from cell cultures. the mean age of the seropositive donors was 34 years (range 25\u201359 years) conservation of polyprotein regions was confirmed using FUZZPRO searches [17] with a maximum of five mismatches. a series of BLAST searches and subsequent analyses were used to identify regions of the polyprotein sequence that were unique to a given serotype.

ELISPOT responses to dengue virus serotype (DEN)-3 peptide 3-specific line in presence of anti-DR, anti-DP or anti-DQ antibodies. IFN- ELISPOT responses using three DEN-3-specific lines of three different DRB1*1501 individuals in the presence of varying concentrations. responses to DENV-1 peptide 1 and DENV-4 peptide 5 were detected in individuals. only two individuals responded to each of the peptides. no ex-vivo responses were detected to DENV-3 peptide 3. despite DEN-4 not being detected in patients with symptomatic DIs, eight of 20 (40%) individuals responded to at least two peptides of the DENV-4. this is perhaps not surprising, as until 2009 DEN-1 accounted for 10% of symptomatic DIs and most individuals were probably not exposed to this virus until recently. serotype-specific and highly conserved peptides from all four DENV serotypes can be used to dissect DENV-specific immune responses in greater detail. the peptides identified by us are serotype-specific and highly conserved. they can be used to determine past infecting DENV serotypes and help us to develop safe and effective vaccines. degreeof conservation was assessed by the use of the virus variationresource on the dengue virus sequence database available at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/VirusVariation/Database/nph-select.cgi cei0168-0215-SD1.doc."}
