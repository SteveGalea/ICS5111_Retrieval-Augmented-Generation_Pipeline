{"summary": "infections of upper and lower respiratory tract can be caused by a variety of pathogens, both viral and bacterial. the etiological agent in such infections differs greatly according to season and age of patient. the highest prevalences are those of respiratory syncytial virus in children and influenza virus in adults. the ePlex respiratory pathogen panel (RP panel) is based on electrowetting technology. droplets of sample and reagents can be moved efficiently within a network of contiguous electrodes in the ePlex cartridge. detection and identification are performed using the eSensor detection technology. 57 nonnasopharyngeal (non-NPS) specimens comprised 69 of the total 464 respiratory pathogens. tests with the RP panel resulted in an overall agreement for 452 (97.4%) targets from 311 specimens, prior to discrepant analysis. neumovirus 28 3 Human rhinovirus/enterovirusa 134b 2c 6a Influenza virus Influenza A 1d H1 5 2009 H1N1 18 1e H3 17 Influenza B 20 Parainfluenza virus Type 1 11 Type 2 12 1 Type 3 15 Type 4 2 2 Respiratory syncytial virus 13d Type A 43 Type B 24 Bacterial Bordetella pertussis 6 Chlamydophila pneumoniae 8 a No differentiation possible between positive result in 17 specimens where the laboratory-developed test (LDT) remained negative (PCR/RP+) seven of these 15 additional targets could be confirmed, including three of RV/enterovirus (EV) (all confirmed as RV), two of PIV4, and one each of hBoV and hCoV NL63. both isolates could be detected by the RP panel. ovirus RESPII16-02 Rhinovirus type 72 d2 Rhinovirus/enterovirus RESPII16-03 Negative RESPII16-04 Adenovirus type 1 Adenovirus type 1 Adenovirus type 1 Coronavirus OC43 Coronavirus OC43 RESPII16-06b Human metapneumovirus RESPII16-07 Rhinovirus type 8 Rhinovirus/enterovirus RESPII16 human metapneumovirus Qnostics RSP-S11 Rhinovirus/enterovirus Qnostics RSP-S12 Bordetella pertussis Qnostics RSP-S13 Chlamydophila pneumoniae Negative Qnostics RSP-S14 Mycoplasma pneumoniae Qnostics RSP-S15 Legionella pneumophila Legionella pneumophila Qnostics RSP-S17 Negative Negative a d1 and d2, the RP panel was able to accurately detect the pathogen(s) in the different types of specimens. the assay showed 100% concordance with LDT. the RP panel showed good detection rates with regard to lower viral or bacterial loads. the number of clinical specimens that could be analyzed was too low for a proper assessment of the assay. in 14 different specimens, the RP panel identified 15 pathogens that had not been detected by routine testing (PCR/RP+) in addition, one influenza A virus detected by LDT could be detected as influenza A virus by the RP panel. the real-time PCR assay has been developed for research use. a total of 4 targets included in the samples could not be detected using the RP panel. the ePlex system can be used as a diagnostic system in a laboratory or a decentralized setting that is closer to the patient. studies evaluating a rapid diagnostic assay for respiratory pathogens have already shown the impact of rapid diagnostics for respiratory pathogens. the RP panel on the ePlex system has the same potential, but clinical studies remain to be conducted to fulfill this potential. opharyngeal [NPS] swabs, 21 sputum samples, 16 bronchoalveolar lavage [BAL] fluid samples, 10 throat swabs, and 10 nasopharyngeal aspirates were used for this study. in the absence of clinical samples, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus isolate Jordan/N3 and recombinant MERS-CoV isolate EMC/2012 were tested. texing, 200 l of the specimen was pipetted into the sample delivery device with a buffer provided by the manufacturer. after gentle mixing of the specimen and buffer in the sample delivery device, the mixture was dispensed into the cartridge using the sample delivery port. a single cartridge of the ePlex RP panel is able to detect 25 respiratory pathogens. clinical specimens selected for this study have previously been submitted and tested prospectively for diagnosis of respiratory infections. a total of 343 clinical specimens (286 nasopharyngeal [NPS] swabs, 21 sputum samples, 16 bronchoalveolar lavage [BAL] fluid samples, 10 throat swabs, and 10 nasopharyngeal aspirates were used for this study. 100 l were used for all specimen types. amplification and detection were performed by real-time PCR. a single cartridge of the RP panel is able to detect 25 respiratory pathogens. a sample detection report was created, comprising the results for all targets and internal controls. results of the targets are reported as positive or not detected. the discordant sample was retested either with a new ePlex cartridge."}
