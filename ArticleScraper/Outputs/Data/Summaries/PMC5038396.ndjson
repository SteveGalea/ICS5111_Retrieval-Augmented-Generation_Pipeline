{"summary": "outbreaks of interest were those listed in the WHO\u2019s Disease Outbreak News (14) from January 1996 through December 2014 that fit our selection criteria. based on predetermined exclusion criteria, we removed outbreaks of ongoing, endemic, or seasonal diseases; isolated or single cases; diseases occurring only in animals; foodborne outbreaks; nonnatural cases. the HDI combines life expectancy, years of schooling, and gross national income per capita into a summary measure of achievement in human development. the polity scale provides a measure of democratic authority among governing authorities ranging from 10 for a hereditary monarchy to 10 for a fully institutionalized democracy (19). studies have found associations between HDI and health system quality, health outcomes, disease prevalence, and health-seeking behavior (20\u201324). we calculated the median time from outbreak start date to each milestone. the 95% CIs for the median values were determined by using the bootstrapping method with 1,000 replicates. data We replicated the data collection methods described in Chan et al. (13) outbreaks of interest were those listed in the WHO\u2019s Disease Outbreak News (14) from January 1996 through December 2014 that fit our selection criteria. the HDI combines life expectancy, years of schooling, and gross national income per capita into a summary measure of achievement in human development. the polity scale provides a measure of democratic authority among governing authorities, ranging from 10 for a hereditary monarchy to 10 for a fully institutionalized democracy (19). a list of outbreak events was used to estimate each of these milestone dates. Statistical Analysis Timeline of Outbreak Progression To characterize the timeline of outbreak progression, we calculated the median time from outbreak start date to each of 4 milestones. the 95% CIs for the median values were determined by using the bootstrapping method with 1,000 replicates. outbreaks with missing dates of discovery or public communication were excluded. we repeated the analysis stratified by WHO region, change in HDI quartile, and country-specific polity quartile in the year of the outbreak. discovery delay and communication delay as outcomes for 2 separate models and outbreak start date as predictor variable for both models. we multiplied the result by 365 and exponentiated it to calculate an annual hazard ratio (HR) of change in timeliness from year to year. outbreaks with missing dates of discovery or public communication were excluded. disease no. outbreaks, N = 347 Anthrax 1 Avian influenza (H9N2) 1 Chikungunya 4 Cholera 93 Dengue 13 Diphtheria 1 Dysentery 1 Enterovirus D68 1 H5 influenza 39 H7 influenza 3 Hand, foot, and mouth disease 4 Hemorrhagic fevers (Crimean-Congo, Ebola, Marburg, undiagnosed), 29 Hantavirus 2 Henipavirus 4 Hepati HDI variable aside from a large increase for the quartile with the greatest decline in HDI rank. time lags increased with decreasing polity from the first through third polity quartiles. then decreased for the quartile of lowest polity (Table 5). quartiles are defined based on all countries with HDI scores from 1990 and 2013 regardless of whether they had outbreaks. outbreaks are not evenly distributed across the quartiles. our HDI-quartile Loess curves illustrate that progress in surveillance systems might vary according to changes in country-level human development metrics. Dashed line marks the beginning of the 5-year period of this study. the 2 middle HDI quartiles exhibited the greatest improvement for both indicators (Table 7). results of univariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses, overall and by region, in a study assessing global capacity for emerging infectious disease detection, 1996\u20132014. most decline 120 1.05 (1.01\u20131.08) 121 1.00 (0.97\u20131.03) *Quartiles are defined based on all countries with HDI scores from 1990 and 2013. change in HDI rank from 1990 to 2013 captures a sustained movement toward improved (or stymied) development. change in HDI rank from 1990 to 2013 captures a sustained movement toward improved (or stymied) development. quartile of polity was the only quartile to show no improvement over time, although this was not significant. international agencies can encourage surveillance efforts by bolstering consensus regarding transparency. despite progress in timeliness of disease discovery, we find that there is room for improvement in timely public communication about outbreaks. despite the general progress in timeliness of disease discovery, we find that there is room for improvement in timely public communication about outbreaks. small annual numbers of eligible outbreaks prevented us from stratifying our analyses by factors that might be associated with surveillance capacity. many confounders or modifiers of interest, such as outbreak severity and size, are not available as validated metrics for analysis. control measures can be set in motion quickly enough to avoid pandemic spread."}
