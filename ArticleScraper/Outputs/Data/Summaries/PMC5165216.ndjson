{"summary": "RESULTS rOC/Us183\u2013241 is more neurovirulent than rOC/ATCC in mice. variant harboring two point mutations in the viral spike (S) glycoprotein showed a significant increase in virus-induced neuronal cell mortality compared to the reference variant (rOC/ATCC) (14). some other variants of HCoV-OC43 were shown to have different levels of neurovirulence in infected mice. rOC/Us183\u2013241 is more neurovirulent than rOC/ATCC in infected mice. we measured infectious viral particles in brain and spinal cord every 2 days. rOC/Us183\u2013241 could be cleared more rapidly than the wild-type virus. rOC/Us183\u2013241 is one of the first regions where HCoV-OC43 spreads in the mouse CNS (17) the infection with either virus showed similar disseminated patterns in other regions of the brain, such as olfactory bulb and cortex. astrogliosis, considered a marker of inflammation, was also investigated and was detected in the hippocampus. rOC/Us183\u2013241 disseminates more rapidly than rOC/ATCC virus in neuronal cell cultures. in murine primary cultures of CNS, the mutant virus spread more rapidly than the wild-type virus in neurons. the difference in viral spread is similar to those observed by histological examination in the CNS of infected BALB/c mice. neurons (red) were stained with a MAb against microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) and the S viral protein (green) was detected with a rabbit antiserum. rOC/Us183\u2013241 infection increases neuronal cell death in correlation with more infectious particle production. rOC/Us183\u2013241 infection increases neuronal cell death. differentiated human neuroblastoma LA-N-5 cells were infected with rOC/ATCC or rOC/Us183\u2013241 at an MOI of 0.03. infection with the mutant virus led to a significant increase in Bax gene expression between 48 hpi and 72 hpi for both viruses. the level of Bax protein remained stable and did not correlate with the increase in mRNA (Fig. 5B) morphology of LA-N-5 cells in presence of staurosporine (STS) or infected by vesicular stomatis virus (VSV) knockdown of Bax expression with shRNA #1 abolished cytopathic effect induced by STS or VSV. protection of neurons was moderate for population shRNA 2 (mild inhibition of Bax expression) following treatment with STS or VSV. totic factor Bax is functional in the LA-N-5 neuronal cells. it does not play a significant role in HCoV-OC43-induced neuronal cell death. mRNA and protein expression of Bax was analyzed by qPCR and WB. HCoV-OC43 infection induces an increase in RIP1 and RIP3 gene expression. in murine primary cultures of CNS, an increase in RIP1 or RIP3 mRNA was detectable at 48 hpi for both viruses compared to mock infection. rOC/Us183\u2013241 infection tended to transcribe more RIP1 and RIP3 mRNA. RIP3 (lower) mRNA in mixed primary cultures of CNS (A) or differentiated LA-N-5 cells (B) infected with rOC/ATCC or rOC/Us183\u2013241 at the indicated times. results are representative of three independent experiments. inhibition of RIP1 and MLKL protects against neuronal cell death induced by both HCoV-OC43 variants and increases viral replication. a significant increase in RIP1 expression was observed at 48 and 72 hpi. in the LA-N-5 cells transduced with the most efficient shRNA for knocking down RIP1 expression (shRNA #2), almost 50-fold more rOC/ATCC particles and 100-fold more rOC/Us183\u2013241 particles were harvested. a reduction of RIP1 expression delayed neuronal cell death induced by both viruses. phosphorylated MLKL was observed only after infection, whereas in the presence of NSA, both infections showed less phosphorylation of MLKL. to further describe cascade of events possibly associated with necroptosis and involving RIP1 during neuronal cell death induced by HCoV-OC43. we studied the activation of the factor MLKL, a known downstream effector that acts as an ion channel. confocal microscopy revealed that MLKL was at the cell surface after HCoV-OC43 infection. this translocation to the cell surface was more important after infection by the mutant virus. together, these results indicate that MLKL is involved in neuronal cell death following HCoV-OC43 infection. rOC/Us183\u2013241 is more neurovirulent than rOC/ATCC in mice. a variant harboring two point mutations in the viral spike (S) glycoprotein (rOC/Us183\u2013241) showed a significant increase in virus-induced neuronal cell mortality compared to the reference variant (rOC/ATCC) (14). rOC/Us183\u2013241 is more neurovirulent than the reference virus in infected mice. rOC/Us183\u2013241 is more neurovirulent than rOC/ATCC in infected mice. rOC/Us183\u2013241 is more neurovirulent than the reference virus in infected mice. rOC/Us183\u2013241 is one of the first regions where HCoV-OC43 spreads in the mouse CNS (17) rOC/Us183\u2013241 reached this portion of the brain faster than rOC/ATCC. infection with either virus showed similar disseminated patterns in other regions of the brain. mice infected with 102.5 TCID50/10 l of rOC/ATCC or rOC/Us183\u2013241. rOC/Us183\u2013241 disseminates more rapidly than rOC/ATCC virus in neuronal cell cultures. kinetics of viral spread were evaluated by immunofluorescence up to 48 hours postinfection. rOC/Us183/241 disseminates more rapidly than rOC/ATCC in neuronal cell cultures. neurons (red) were stained with a MAb against microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) and the S viral protein (green) was detected with a rabbit antiserum. rOC/Us183\u2013241 infection increases neuronal cell death and produces more infectious particles than rOC/ATCC infection. rOC/Us183\u2013241 infection increases neuronal cell death and produces more infectious particles. apoptosis is one of the best-described cell death pathways. we have previously reported that Bax was relocalized to mitochondria. infection induced a significant increase in Bax gene expression between 48 hpi and 72 hpi for both viruses. in murine mixed primary cultures of CNS or differentiated human neuroblastoma LA-N-5 cells infected with rOC/ATCC or rOC/Us183\u2013241 at the indicated times was performed by Western blot analysis (WB) even the most efficient knockdown of Bax expression did not protect LA-N-5 cells from damages induced by rOC/ATCC or rOC/Us183\u2013241 infection at 48 hpi compared to the control rOC/Us183\u2013241, we measured cell viability and confirmed that Bax knockdown did not confer any protection against neuronal cell death induced during HCoV-OC43 infection. this knockdown led to strong protection against neuronal cell death induced by STS or VSV at 24 hpi in a dose-dependent manner compared to the control population. together, these results indicate that the proapoptotic factor Bax is functional in the LA-N-5 neuron differentiated LA-N-5 cells transduced with different shRNAs were infected with VSV or treated with STS for 24 h. HCoV-OC43 infection induces an increase in RIP1 and RIP3 gene expression. HCoV-OC43 infection increases RIP1 and RIP3 gene expression. levels of RIP1 (upper) or RIP3 (lower) mRNA in murine mixed primary cultures of CNS (A) or differentiated LA-N-5 cells (B) infected with rOC/ATCC or rOC/Us183\u2013241 at the indicated times. western blotting revealed that shRNA #2 was more efficient at knocking down expression of RIP1. inhibition of RIP1 by knockdown decreased the HCoV-OC43-induced cell death at 72 hpi in a dose-dependent manner compared to that of infected LA-N-5 cells transduced with control shRNA (NT) a significant increase in cell-associated mutant infectious viral particles was observed at 48 and 72 hpi. results are representative of three independent experiments. cell viability was measured by PrestoBlue assay. phosphorylated MLKL was observed only after infection. whereas in the presence of NSA, both infections showed less phosphorylation of MLKL. we infected LA-N-5 cells with the reference or mutant virus. the cells were labeled with antibody against the N-terminal epitope of MLKL. these results indicate that MLKL is involved in neuronal cell death. differentiated LA-N-5 cells were infected with rOC/ATCC or rOC/Us183\u2013241 at an MOI of 1. The surface distribution of MLKL (green) and nucleus (blue) were detected by confocal microscopy. for panels A and B, data are represented as means SD. rOC/Us183\u2013241 infection enhanced the unfolded protein response (UPR) and protein synthesis inhibition (13), suggesting that this mutant virus could increase ER stress in neurons associated with neurodegeneration and neuropathogenesis in infected mice. mutations in the viral S protein appear to modulate the neuronal cellular response involving inflammation, neuronal damage, and eventually loss of neurons by RCD activation. HCoV-OC43 infection leads to the production of proinflammatory cytokines. this contributes to enhanced proinflammatory cytokine secretion and to a deleterious neuroinflammation process. neurovirulence of the murine coronavirus MHV-A59 was linked to the excessive production of proinflammatory cytokine secretion. cytomegalovirus (65), myxoma virus (66), vaccinia virus (67) and Epstein-Barr virus (68) all encode viral Bcl-2 homologs that interact with and inhibit Bax activation. HCoV-OC43 infection induces a redox imbalance, promoting translocation of Bax to the mitochondria without any consequences on neuronal cell death. lateral sclerosis (74), Huntington's disease (75), multiple sclerosis (76) and ischemic brain injury (77) may be related to necroptosis activation. expression and activation of these factors are also considered to be a defense mechanism against pathogen invasion (64, 79) several viruses, such as reovirus (81), reovirus (81), IAV (82), CMV, and HSV (83), are known to activate RIP1, RIP expression also results in an increase of cell-associated infectious particle production. expression suggests that RIP1 is activated by neurons in response to the infection as an attempt to restrict viral replication. this suggests necroptosis-like pathways related to RIP1 and MLKL were involved in the cell death induced by HCoV-OC43. infection by HCoV-OC43 induced an ER stress in neurons that initiate RIP1-MLKL-driven necroptosis. inhibition of cyclophilin D, an isomerase acting to modulate the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, has been shown to reduce necroptosis-related cell death in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. is-like pathway (mutant versus wild-type virus), it may induce an excessive neuroinflammation associated with an enhanced release of DAMPs (37, 79), and the cellular response to the infection may become deleterious for the host. challenge will be to target and modulate specific RCD activation without interfering in antiviral responses within the CNS to attenuate the deleterious effect. cells were seeded in RPMI supplemented with 15% (vol/vol) FBS, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM NaPy, 100 M nonessential amino acids. the next day and every 2 days for a period of 6 days, 10 M all-trans-retinoic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the same medium supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) FBS.
