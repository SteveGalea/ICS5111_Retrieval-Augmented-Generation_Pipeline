{"summary": "the HDV ribozyme is the fastest-known naturally occurring self-cleaving ribozyme. it folds into a double-pseudoknot conformation and self-cleaves. the ribozyme is active in vitro in the absence of any proteins. the removal of introns from pre-mRNA is fundamentally important for eukaryotic life. most introns are removed by a ribonucleoprotein complex called the spliceosome. the only portion of the RNA that spans all three helical domains is a pseudoknot belt. the RNA adopts a -shaped fold of its three helices in which stems 2 and 3 stack coaxially, with stem 1 abutting the active site. the 5\u2032 end of the RNA bridges helical stems 3 and 1, generating a complex nested pseudoknot topology. telomerase, the ribonucleoprotein complex responsible for the maintenance of the telomere ends, is upregulated in most cancers. a number of organisms have evolved mechanisms to cause programmed frameshifting of the ribosome in either the +1 or 1 direction. programmed 1 ribosomal frameshifting is typically found in viruses and is required for the replication and proliferation of all retroviruses. the MMTV pseudoknot has a bend of approximately 60\u00b0 between the two helices. it is caused by an unpaired adenine that intercalates between the helices. the bend between stems 1 and 2 is required for efficient frameshifting. simian retrovirus 1 pseudoknot contains a number of unique features. recent work has suggested that the frameshift-inducing pseudoknot may be unique because it contains a third stem\u2013loop [31,32]. bioinformatic, phylogenetic, and structural evidence is reported indicating that the SARS-CoV pseudoknot is indeed a three-stemmed RNA pseudoknot."}
