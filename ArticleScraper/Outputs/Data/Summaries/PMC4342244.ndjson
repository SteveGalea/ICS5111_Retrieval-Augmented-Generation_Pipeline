{"summary": "EBOV infection is characterized by rapid viral replication and dysregulated immune responses. the disease follows profound suppression of type I IFN signaling and a contrasting excess inflammation that leads to mucosal hemorrhages. administration of recombinant IFN or IFN confers delayed time-to-death in NHPs [19, 20]. recombinant viruses, VLPs, and anti-sense siRNA have been developed. EBOV infection remains a potential threat to public health, compounded with lack of effective prevention or treatment. the reduced inflammatory responses coincided with the attenuation of proinflammatory cytokine surge in EBOV infected mice. early type I IFN response is a major mechanism that contributes to VLP mediated protection against EBOV infection. VLPs and EBOV infection were composed of EBOV GP, NP and VP40. mice were infected with 1000 pfu (3,000 LD50) of mouse-adapted EBOV via intraperitoneal route. Morbidity and mortality of EBOV infected mice monitored twice daily for up to 14 days. transcript levels were normalized with Hprt, and expressed as relative expression. data represent the mean of at least three independent assay SEM. p value 0.05 was considered significant. mice were infected with 1000 pfu (3,000 LD50) of mouse-adapted EBOV via intraperitoneal (i.p.) route. Morbidity and mortality of EBOV infected mice were monitored twice daily for up to 14 days. Ifnar1 -/- mice were injected with 50 g of VLPs 24h after EBOV infection. 80% of mice that received VLPs survived after EBOV infection. GP transcripts were normalized by Hprt. values represent mean SEM of duplicate samples from three independent experiments. EBOVs are thought to initially infect DCs and macrophages in liver and spleen, making these tissues the major sites of EBOV replication in the mouse. VLP injection may not have prevented EBOV pathogenesis in Ifnar -/- mice. but the disease manifests more severely in these mice than in WT mice. EBOV VLPs activate type I IFN transcription in DCs and macrophages. WT mice were injected with VLPs 24 h post-EBOV challenge. transcripts of indicated ISGs in liver (A) and spleen (B) were measured on days 0, 1.5 and 2 post-infection. ifit1, Mx1, Oas1a and Stat1 represent ISGs with anti-viral activity. VLPs accelerated induction of negative regulatory ISGs. this may help suppress EBOV\u2019s anti-IFN antagonism. none of the ISGs tested in Fig. 2 were induced in Ifnar -/- mice. RNA from liver of WT mice (n = 5/group) infected with EBOV was tested for expression of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL-6 and IL-1), chemokines (MCP-1, MIP-1, MIP-1 and KC (CXCL1)) and Inflammasome gene NLRP3 on indicated days post-infection. nar -/- mice (n = 5/group) infected with EBOV were tested for expression of indicated cytokines or chemokines on day 2 post-infection. values represent the mean of duplicate samples from three individual experiments SEM. asterisks denote **P 0.01, *P 0.05. Ifnar -/- macrophages elicit exaggerated proinflammatory cytokine responses. expression of indicated ISGs, proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were assessed by qRT-PCR. Ifnar -/- mice died 1 to 2 days earlier than Irf8 -/- mice. mRNA levels were much higher in EBOV infected Irf8 -/- mice than Irf8 +/+ mice. *** indicates P 0.001, ** P 0.01 and *P 0.05. wild type (WT) and Ifnar1 -/- mice were injected with 50 g of VLPs 24h after infection by the mouse adapted (ma EBOV) QRT-PCR detection of EBOV GP mRNA level on day 2 post-EBOV infection with or without VLPs from liver (B) and spleen (C) of WT or Ifnar -/- mice. EBOVs are thought to initially infect DCs and macrophages in liver and spleen. mediated protection is linked to the activation of type I IFN signaling. however, VLP injection may not have prevented EBOV pathogenesis in Ifnar -/- mice. it has been shown that EBOV VLPs activate type I IFN transcription in DCs and macrophages in vitro. WT mice were injected with VLPs 24 h post-EBOV challenge. transcripts of indicated ISGs in liver (A) and spleen (B) were measured on days 0, 1.5 and 2 post-infection. ifit1, Mx1, Oas1a and Stat1 represent ISGs with anti-viral activity. VLP induction of negative regulatory ISGs is dependent on type I IFN signaling. none of the ISGs tested in Fig. 2 were induced in Ifnar -/- mice. expression of proinflammatory cytokines was measured in EBOV infected mice. RNA from liver of WT mice (n = 5/group) infected with EBOV with or without VLP treatment was tested for expression of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL-6 and IL-1) and chemokines (MCP-1, MIP-1, MIP-1 and KC (CXCL1). RNA from Ifnar +/+ and Ifnar -/- mice (n = 5/group) was tested for expression of indicated cytokines or chemokines on day 2 post-infection. values represent the mean of duplicate samples from three individual experiments SEM. Ifnar -/- macrophages elicit exaggerated proinflammatory cytokine responses. expression of indicated ISGs, proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were assessed by qRT-PCR. Ifnar -/- mice died 1 to 2 days earlier than Irf8 -/- mice. induction of anti-viral and negative feedback ISGs is dependent on IRF8. results were similar in liver and spleens. *** indicates P 0.001, ** P 0.01 and *P 0.05. we investigated the role of type I IFN signaling in vivo. this conclusion is supported by the observation that post-exposure VLP treatment accelerated ISG induction in EBOV infected mice. VLP-induced ISGs included anti-viral proteins known to inhibit replication of RNA viruses such as Ifit1, Mx1 and Oas1a. negative feedback factors that curb excess inflammatory responses may interfere with EBOV life cycle. impaired type I IFN signaling delays induction of antiviral ISGs. it hinders maturation of macrophages and DCs and development of antigen presentation activity. adaptive immunity is not adequately induced. Ifnar -/- mice expressed higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. these results are in accordance with the growing recognition that type I IFNs are linked to attenuation of inflammatory responses. in this system, overt inflammatory responses were attributed to IFN signaling in macrophages and DCs. the transcription factor IRF8 is required for VLP mediated post-exposure protection. the results offer an added mechanistic insight into the pathways through which VLPs provide protection. the transcription factor helps to amplify type I IFN gene induction. RNA from spleen of Ifnar +/+ and Ifnar -/- mice (n = 5/group) infected with EBOV was tested for expression of indicated cytokines or chemokines on day 2 post-infection. data represent the mean of duplicate samples from more than three independent experiments SEM."}
