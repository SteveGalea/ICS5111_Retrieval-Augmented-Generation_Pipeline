{"summary": "study evaluated clinical characteristics of RVI and established strategies for the PCR test in children and adolescents with hematological malignancies. group I included 46 (49.5%) cases of RVI, including 31 (67.4%) upper and 15 (32.6%) lower respiratory infections. more patients in group I had community-acquired respiratory illnesses (p=0.003) and complained of rhinorrhea (p0.001) and sputum (p=0.008) neutropenic fever (NF) is considered a major pathogen. however, the causative pathogens are not identified in 53\u201379% of patients with NF,3,4 and some of which may be respiratory viruses (RVs) a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test showed improved sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of RVI in immune compromised patients compared to conventional methods. study was performed to evaluate clinical characteristics and outcomes of RVI diagnosed by a multiplex PCR test for RVs. patients with underlying hematological malignancies treated at the department of pediatrics, Seoul St. Mary\u2019s Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea were eligible for this study. patients in whom respiratory symptoms developed 6 months or more after the completion of anti-cancer chemotherapy or 2 years or more after HCT were excluded. for RVs was performed using a commercially available kit. the kit tested for influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, RSV, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), adenovirus, coronavirus, and human bocavirus. URI was diagnosed when abnormal findings were observed in chest imaging studies. co-infections were defined when any other types of non-viral infection were identified at the same time as the patient complaint of respiratory symptoms. Mortality due to RVI was defined when the patient died with persistent respiratory symptoms and signs. the medical records of the enrolled patients were reviewed retrospectively. the patients were sub-divided into those with upper respiratory tract infections (URIs) and lower respiratory tract infections (LRIs) the clinical and laboratory characteristics were also compared between groups. community-acquired respiratory illness was defined if respiratory symptoms developed before or within 2 days of admission. Neutropenia was defined as an absolute neutrophil count 500/mm3. co-infections were defined when any other types of non-viral infection were identified at the same time as the patient complaint of respiratory symptoms. median interval between recurrent episodes of respiratory illnesses was 19 weeks (range, 5\u201352 weeks) group I included 46 (49.5%) episodes of RVI, including 31 (67.4%) URIs and 15 (32.6%) LRIs. rhinovirus (N=17, 37.0%) was the most frequent. eight (8.6%) episodes were accompanied by invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. chickenpox, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, and Clostridium difficile infection accompanied one (1.1%) episode each. the difference between Groups I and II was not statistically significant. the difference was not statistically significant. 0.093 Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis 4 (8.7) 4 (8.5) E. coli bacteremia 0 (0.0) 2 (4.3) Viridans streptococcal bacteremia 0 (0.0) 2 (4.3) E. faecium bacteremia 0 (0.0) 2 (4.3) Herpetic gingivostomatitis 0 (0.0) 2 (4.3) S. epidermidis bacteremia 1 (2.2) four of the five patients with LRIs and co-infections experienced invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. the rate of rhinovirus infection was significantly higher in patients with URIs than in those with LRIs (p=0.021) 0.038 Chemotherapy preceding respiratory tract infection 0.006 Induction chemotherapy 2 (6.5) 0 (0.0) Re-induction chemotherapy 2 (6.5) 4 (26.7) Consolidation chemotherapy 11 (35.5) 1 (6.7) Maintenance chemotherapy 10 (32.3) 3 (20.0) Steroid use within prior 1 month 19 (61.3) 10 (66.7) 0.723 Neutropenia on the development of RVI 9 (29.0) 7 (46.7) 0.239 Accompanying respiratory symptom Fever 28 (90 significantly more patients in Group II presented with hospital-acquired respiratory illnesses (p=0.003) than those in Group I (Table 2).

RVI was diagnosed in about half of the enrolled patients, consistent with the results of previous studies using PCR tests. s was not identified, were more likely to have neutropenia, hospital-acquired and severe respiratory illnesses, and infections with non-viral pathogens. this suggests that patients in group II underwent more aggressive anti-cancer chemotherapies, had a more severe immunosuppression, and were hospitalized for longer periods. a negative PCR result in patients with NF may suggest the presence of more severe infection or treatment-related complications. ribavirin-based anti-viral therapy can reduce progression from URI to LRI and mortality in RSV-infected HCT recipients. the effect on parainfluenza virus infection has not been confirmed. 73.3% of LRI cases progressed from URIs in this study. a multiplex PCR test for RVs should be performed preferentially in patients complaining of rhinorrhea or sputum and with relapsed or refractory underlying hematological malignancies, co-infections or severe cytopenia. the outcomes of RVI in immune compromised children and adolescents may be favorable with the inclusion of mild RVI cases. the introduction of multiplex PCR tests for RV detection should be encouraged, especially for patients complaining of rhinorrhea."}
