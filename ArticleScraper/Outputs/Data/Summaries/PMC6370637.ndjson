{"summary": "CD8+ T lymphocytes (CTL) are crucial for controlling viruses and tumors. however, in several chronic viral infections, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection of humans or Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and Friend virus (FV) infection of mice, virus-specific CD8+ T cells become functionally exhausted. the functional impairment of CTLs is associated with the expression of the murine Friend retrovirus model was used to characterize the effects of PD-1 inhibitory checkpoint receptor expressed on CTLs or its ligand PD-L1 for the regulation of these cells during an acute infection. despite this efficient initial viral immunity, FV eventually escapes from T cell mediated immune control and establishes a chronic infection (12). mice with gene defects in genes were used for the analysis of the effects of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway on the virus-specific CTL response during an acute viral infection. the current study provides new data about the functional role of inhibitory checkpoint receptors during an acute viral infection. offspring mice were used as donors for CD8+ T cells in the adoptive cell transfer experiments. all mice were females at 8\u201316 weeks of age at the beginning of the experiments. all mice were females at the beginning of the experiments. the quantity of survivor cells at day 10 was calculated by determining the portion of cells detectible at day 10 after infection. spleen cells were stained with PE labeled MHC class I H2-Db (Beckman Coulter, Marseille, France) tetramers specific for FV GagL peptide (18, 22) as described previously. Splenocytes (1 107 cells of each population) were transferred i.v. into nave or 10 day FV-infected mice. one hour after adoptive transfer, spleens and bone marrows from recipient mice were harvested and cell suspensions were prepared. 12-day infected recipient mice were determined. Mean numbers plus SD of 4\u20137 mice are shown. unpaired t-test was used for the analysis of differences at every time point. non-unique peptides associated to more than one protein accession were not used for quantification. differentially expressed proteins were functionally annotated using the database for annotation, visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID, ver. 6.8) B6-background PD-1 deficient (PD-1/) mice were originally generated by L.C. (17). DbGagL TCR tg mice were on a C57BL/6 background and more than 90% of the CD8+ T cells contained a TCR specific for the DbGagL FV epitope (18, 19) granzyme A (GzA-3G8.5), granzyme B (GB11, Invitrogen, Darmstadt, Germany), granzyme K (orb102688), activated caspase 3 and Ki67 stainings were performed as described. data were acquired on a flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) from 200,000 to 300,000 lymphocyte-gated events per sample. ten thousand purified cells were transferred into recipient WT or PD-L1/ mice by i.v. injection in 100 l PBS. in vivo CTL assay was modified to measure cytotoxicity in FV-infected mice. cytometry was used to detect the transferred donor CD8+ T cells (CD8+ CD45.1+) the frequency of CD45.1+ CD8+ donor cells in the spleen (C) and bone marrow (D) of 8- and 12-day infected recipient mice was determined. protein isolation, digestion, amino acid analysis, and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) were performed by following previously described procedures (25). progenesis QI for proteomics (v. 2.0.5387.52102; Non-linear Dynamics, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK) and Proteome Discoverer (v. 1.4; Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany) software packages were used for protein quantification and identification. FV-induced CD8+ T cells were defined by expression of a glycosylated form of the CD43 molecule (29). the deficiency for the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway influences acute T cell immunity, wild type mice, PD-1/ and PD-L1/ mice were infected with FV. frequency of effector CD8+ CD43+ T cells from PD-L1/ was 2.3 times higher than that in WT and PD-1 KO mice at day 10. effector cells continued to grow until day 15 after FV infection in the spleen of PD-L1 KO mice. kinetic of effector CD8+ T cells specific for the FV gagL epitope was very similar to the kinetic of the total effector CD8+ CD43+ population. peak expansion of virus-specific CD8+ tetramer+ T cells was at day 10 in both organs and again frequencies were enhanced in KO mice. spleens of PD-1/ and PD-L1/mice before CD8+ T cells expanded. at day 8 after infection, as well as day 10 in the spleen, viral loads were significantly higher in WT mice compared to animals deficient for PD-1 or PD-L1. at later time points no differences in viral loads were observed between the mouse strains, with a low viral load in PD-1 KO mice at day 12 in the BM. the numbers of effector cells producing GzmB in the spleen were reduced. however, in BM the numbers of CD8+ CD43+ GzmB+ cells remained enhanced in both KO mouse strains at most of the later time points after infection. kinetic analysis was performed at different time points after FV infection. spleen and bone marrow cells from recipient mice were isolated 2 h after injection. each dot represents an individual mouse and the mean numbers and SD are indicated. differences were analyzed by one-way ANOVA with a Tukey post-test. the cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells was significantly higher at day 8 and day 15 after infection in the spleen and bone marrow. the efficacy of killing was always higher in PD-L1 KO mice than in PD-1 KO mice, reflecting the stronger expansion and effector cell activation in the PD-L1 deficient animals. T cells expressing granzyme A (GzmA), GzmB, and granzyme K (GzmK) were determined in the spleen of PD-L1/ mice at day 8 (Figure 3A), day 10 (Figure 3B) and day 12 (Figure 3C) after FV infection. significantly more CTLs from PD-L1/ than WT mice produced GzmB or GzmK at day 8. Flow cytometry was used to detect intracellular expression of GzmA, GzmB, and GzmK in effector CD8+ T cells (CD43+) and in virus-specific Tetramer+CD8+ (D\u2013F) expressing single, double, or all three granzymes together. CD8+ T cells were isolated from the spleens of CD45.1 TCR-Tg mice. the expansion of transferred cells was characterized on day 8 and day 12 after infection by staining for CD45.1+ CD8+ T cells. most of the expanded CD8+ CD45.1+ T cells from 8 days FV-infected WT and PD-L1-/- mice upregulated PD-1 on the cell surface. a global analysis of the CD8+ T cell proteome was performed by label-free quantification using liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. a total of 2673 proteins were quantitated and compared between CD8+ CD45.1+ T cells isolated from WT vs. PD-L1 KO mice. the expression of caspase 3 was reduced in cells isolated from PD-L1/ mice. CD8+ CD45.1+ T cells were isolated from spleens of WT and PD-L1/ mice. one day later recipients animals were infected with FV. differences were analyzed by Benjamini-Hochberg corrected one-way ANOVA (A,B), one-way ANOVA with a Tukey post-test (C,D), or an unpaired t-test (E,F). Statistically significant differences between the groups are indicated (*p 0.05, ***p 0.0005) 13% of the CD8+ tetramer+ T cells expressed the activated caspase 3 enzyme in WT mice. only 6% of the virus-specific CD8+ T cells from PD-1/ and 4% from PD-L1/ mice expressed caspase 3. PD-1 signaling may also regulate apoptosis in virus-specific CD8+ T cells. 34% of the effector CD8+CD43+ T cells and 38% of the virus-specific CD8+ tetramer+ CD8+ T cells in the spleens of 10 day infected WT mice expressed CD80 on the cell surface. the treatment of FV-infected WT or PD-1/ mice with the blocking anti-CD80 antibody did not affect the numbers of effector CD43+CD8+ T cells or virus-specific CD8+ tetra Flow cytometry was used to detect the frequency of effector CD8+ T cells and CD8+ T cells specific for the FV gagL epitope (Tetramer+) in anti-CD80 treated and non-treated animals. each dot represents an individual mouse and the mean numbers and SD are indicated. effector phenotypes were enhanced in the spleen at day 6 after infection. effector CD8+ CD43+ T cells peaked in both organs of all analyzed mouse strains. at peak expansion the frequency of effector cells from PD-L1/ was 2.3 times higher than that in WT mice. data was pooled from three independent experiments with similar results. one-way ANOVA with a Tukey post-test was used for the comparison of both KO mice strains with WT animals at every analyzed time point. Activated effector CD8+ T cells eliminate FV-infected cells during acute retroviral infection. PD-1 and especially PD-L1 deficiency influenced the frequencies of virus-specific effector CD8+ T cells during acute infection. effector CD8+ CD43+ T cells was enhanced at day 7 after infection in spleens and in BM. at day 12 and day 15 after infection, the numbers of effector cells producing GzmB were significantly higher in both KO mouse strains. however, in BM the numbers of effector CD8+ CD43+ GzmB+ cells remained enhanced in both KO mouse strains at most of the later time points after infection. one-way ANOVA with a Tukey post-test was used for the comparison of both KO mice strains with WT animals at every analyzed time point. CFSE labeled spleen cells from nave CD45.1 mice were loaded with FV peptide and were injected intravenously into nave and 8 or 15 days infected mice. in both organs the frequencies of GzmB+ T cells were higher in the PD-L1/ mice than in the PD-1/ mice. the main function of virus-specific CTLs is the killing of cells expressing viral antigens. in order to analyze the cytotoxic potential of CTLs we performed an in vivo killing assay. the granzymes produced by antiviral CTLs have a different spectrum of target proteins and mediate a diverse range of cytotoxic, proinflammatory, and antiviral functions. the frequency of CD8+ CD43+ T cells expressing granzyme A (GzmA), GzmB, and granzyme K (GzmK) were determined in the spleen of WT and PD-L1/ mice at day 8 (Figure 3A), day 10 significant differences were only found for the production of single Gzms (GzmA, GzmB) at the late time point day 12 after FV infection. the PD-1 signaling pathway suppressed the simultaneous production of different Gzms in effector CD8+ cells. the analysis was performed at day 8, 10, and 12 after FV infection. PD-1 and PD-L1 KO mice all cells are deficient for these molecules. the absence of PD-L1 has a significant effect on differentiation of myeloid cells. the following experiment was designed to test the direct influence of PD-L1 on the expansion of effector CD8+ T cells. the transfer experiment confirmed the data from PD-L1/ mice. a global analysis of the CD8+ T cell proteome was performed by label-free quantification using liquid chromatography. expression of caspase 3 was reduced in cells isolated from PD-L1/ mice. proteome analysis, proliferation, and apoptosis of virus-specific CD8+ T cells in PD-L1/ mice. CD8+ CD45.1+ T cells were isolated from spleens of WT and PD-L1/ mice. Flow cytometry was used to detect numbers of virus-specific Tetramer+ CD8+ T cells in spleen (E) and bone marrow (F) of 8 days infected mice. each dot represents an individual mouse and the mean numbers and SD are indicated. apoptosis regulates the number of virus-specific CD8+ T cells in acutely FV-infected mice. apoptosis plays an important role in regulating CD8+ T cell number during acute FV infection and PD-1 signaling influences levels of apoptosis. L1 knockout was stronger in almost all measurements than the effect of PD-1 knockout. it was previously shown that CD80 expressed on activated T cells may function as additional receptor of PD-L1 and delivers suppressive signals to T cells (36). Approximately 34% of the effector CD8+CD43+ T cells and 38% of the virus-specific CD8+ tetramer+ CD8+ T cells in the spleens of 10 day infected WT mice expressed CD80 Flow cytometry was used to detect the frequency of effector CD8+ T cells and virus-specific CD8+ T cells expressing CD80. each dot represents an individual mouse and the mean numbers and SD are indicated. differences were analyzed by unpaired t-test. the absence of PD-1 suppression during acute corona virus infection (42), murine hepatitis virus strain-3 (MHV-3) (43) or LCMV infection (44, 45) lead to an enhanced immunopathology and mortality of infected animals. apoptosis is another mechanism that determines the quantity of activated effector cells. apoptosis plays a key role in dampening immune responses. apoptosis plays a key role in dampening immune responses. caspase 3 is the important executor molecule managing the apoptosis process. this enzyme starts the cascade of irreversible changes ultimately resulting in programmed cell death. previous studies showed that the presence of caspase 3 is a phenotypic marker of activated effector T cells and not always associated with apoptosis. PD-1 signaling regulates the quantity of antiviral T cells through the inhibition of proliferation and the induction of apoptosis. these observations from KO mice allow us to better understand the role of PD-1 during the early phase of antiviral immune responses."}
