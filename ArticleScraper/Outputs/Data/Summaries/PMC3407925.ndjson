{"summary": "the HIV epidemic continues largely unabated with approximately 8000 new infections every day. the existing HIV drug treatments can control, but are not able to cure HIV infection. a vaccine against HIV should offer the best chance of reducing HIV infection and viral transmission, but approaches to elicit protective immune responses remain still elusive. PRISA 004 trial investigated a gel containing 1% tenofovir. this gel reduced women\u2019s risk of HIV infection by 39%. no protective effect was observed in a large phase IIb clinical trial. glycans are added co-translationally to newly synthesized polypeptides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) they are linked to the amide side chain of an asparagine residue present in the sequon NX (T/S), where X can be any amino acid except proline. the correct folded protein then migrates to the Golgi apparatus, where glycosidases and glycosyltransferases process the glycan algal lectins can be considered as CBAs with the most potent anti-HIV activity described so far. they are proteins of non-immunoglobulin nature capable of recognition of and reversible binding to carbohydrate moieties of complex glycocongugates. they can be found across a wide variety of species in nature including prokaryotes, sea corals, algae, fungi, higher plants, invertebrates and vertebrates. algal lectins could inhibit replication of HIV and other classes of enveloped viruses by interacting with carbohydrates present on the viral envelopes. the primary structure and disulfide bonding pattern of CV-N was determined by conventional biochemical techniques. CV-N consists of 101 amino acid residues that can be divided in two internal repeats of 50 and 51 amino acids that show strong sequence similarity to one another. microvirin (MVN) is a novel lectin isolated from the cyanobacterium Mycrocystis aeruginosa. MVN has an average molecular mass of 12.7 kDa and consists of 108 amino acids. the amino acid sequence of MVN contains two tandem repeats. MVL is a homodimer stabilized by an extensive intermolecular interface. the specificity of MVL is unique in that its minimal target comprises the Man(1\u20136)Man(1\u20134)GlcNAc(1\u20134)GlcNAc tetrasaccharide core of oligomannosides. the cyanobacterial lectin Oscillatoria agardhii agglutinin (OAA) was isolated from cyanobacteria. the amino acid sequence of OAA consists of 132 amino acids forming two homologous domains, consisting of the residues 1\u201366 and 67\u2013132. the protein contains two carbohydrate binding sites positioned symmetrically at two ends. GRFT has a molecular weight of 12.7 kDa and a sequence of 121 amino acids. residue on position 31 does not match any of the 20 standard amino acids. the homodimer has six carbohydrate binding pockets, 3 located at each of the opposite ends of the double-prism homodimer. HIV-1 X4 and X4/R5 laboratory strain in MT-4 cells 0.7\u20135 nM [41] HIV-1 X4 laboratory strain in MT-2 cells 4 ng/mL [42] 16 nM [43] HIV-1 X4 laboratory strain in MT-2 cells 0.4\u20135.8 nM [15,40] HIV-2 X4 laboratory strain in MT-2 cells 0.4\u20135.8 nM [15,40] HIV-2 X4 laboratory PBMC >350 nM [43] HIV-2 clinical isolate in PBMC >350 nM [43] Env-pseudotyped X4, R5 and X4/R5 HIV-1 strains in TZM-bl cells 2\u201312 nM [23] MVL HIV-1 X4 and R5 Env-mediated fusion in a quantitative vaccinia virus reporter gene assay 30\u201337 nM [46] SVN CV-N was active against HIV-1 and HIV-2 laboratory strains with EC50 values between 0.1 and 160 nM. CV-N was also tested against clinical isolates from many different clades. MVN was not active against a HIV-1 clinical isolate. SVN was active against HIV-1 laboratory strains and clinical isolates with EC50 values between 0.3 and 7 nM and 0.4 and 394 nM respectively. GRFT showed also potent antiviral activity against different HIV-1 clade clinical isolates with EC50 values between 0.05 and 56 nM. free virions and HIV-infected donor cells can also penetrate the vaginal epithelium by migrating through microabrasions that can be induced during the intercourse. CD4+ T cells are probably the principal cell type infected at the portal of entry. algal lectins CV-N, MVN and GRFT can inhibit transmission of HIV between persistently infected cells and uninfected CD4+ T cells with IC50 values of 4\u201346 nM, 124 nM and 1 nM respectively. no data are available for the algal lectins MVL, SVN and OAA. CV-N, MVN, GRFT and SVN were capable of inhibiting the capture of HIV-1 by DC-SIGN [43,63,64] CV-N, MVN, GRFT and SVN could also inhibit the transmission to CD4+ T cells with IC50 values between 4 and 69.2 nM, 169 nM, 4.4 and 35 nM and 70.6 and 441.3 nM respectively. L, 10 mg/mL or 20 mg/mL of CV-N were used to get 85% inhibition of vaginal SHIV challenge [67] also, CV-N protected macaques from rectal SHIV challenge [68]. activity of Algal Lectins against Other STDs HIV-1 infection is commonly associated with other sexual transmitted viruses, such as HSV. CV-N is effective against Ebola virus, hepatitis C virus, measles virus, herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) and human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6) safety of algal lectins Irrespective of the potent antiviral activity of these lectins as potential microbicide candidates. nonoxynol-9 showed in vitro activity against HIV-1 and other sexually transmitted infections and prevented SIV infections in macaques. CV-N was associated with a modest increase in expression of gamma interferon, stromal cell-derived factor 1 and interleukin 4. however, 2 h exposure to CV-N had no effect on cytokine expression in PBMC or tissue explant culture over a 24 h period. GRFT induces only minimal changes in secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines by epithelial cells or human PBMC [50]. GRFT-P (plant-produced GRFT) was shown to be safe in ex vivo human cervical explants [51]. the deletions were due to a deletion of a 13-amino-acid stretch 394-TWFNSTWSTEGSN-406 affecting 3 glycosylation sites at the same time. a single deglycosylation at N295 or N448 by site-directed mutagenesis resulted in marked resistance to CV-N, GRFT and SVN. CV-N, MVN, GRFT, MVL, SVN and OAA are promising candidate microbicides for the prevention of HIV transmission by interacting with the glycans on HIV gp120. however, these lectins do have unique properties, including the number of carbohydrate recognition sites and their specificity for oligosaccharides. antiviral activity and safety are important, however, this does not guarantee a successful microbicide. it is however a misconception that proteins, such as the algal lectins, are too expensive for use."}
