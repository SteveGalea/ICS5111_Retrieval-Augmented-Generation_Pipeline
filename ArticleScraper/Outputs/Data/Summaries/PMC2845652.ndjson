{"summary": "theoretical work has so far dealt with contact tracing as a branching process [12], through modifications to mean-field equations [13], pairwise approximations [14] and simulation [15]. this work means the implications of heterogeneous numbers of contacts for the efficacy of contact tracing are reasonably well understood. individuals are either susceptible (), infectious () or traced () and move between these compartments due to four processes: infection; treatment; tracing; and stopping tracing. this paradigm is suitable for the consideration of sexually transmitted diseases, where infectious individuals can transmit infection to contacts, then seek treatment, which stops transmission but leaves the individual susceptible. the full set of partnership links can be thought of as forming a network. for infection, the term in brackets is the number of susceptible-infectious pairs in the population and is the transmission rate constant. for tracing, the term in brackets is the number of infectious-traced pairs in the population and is the tracing rate constant. we use a low-level closure that approximates pairs in terms of individuals. (2) where is the number of nodes in the network, and is the number of links per node. for clustered networks, SIS dynamics and contact tracing, all of which we are considering here, it is not clear that a similar argument can be used. the first of these is that we would like to preserve the pair-level relation. for the dynamical system (3), this pair-level relation will be preserved over time. the second problem with the standard closure is the question of how triangles of three infected individuals behave during the early asymptotic stage of an epidemic. a complementary approach to pairwise models comes from individual-based, stochastic simulation. we generate explicit networks that are designed to introduce structure to the population. this enables us to test results derived using pairwise equations against stochastic results. this complements our general approach of looking at the implications of finite neighbourhood size and clustering. this method generates networks with clustering parameters up to before running out of possible rewirings. at low neighbourhood sizes, this method generates networks with clustering parameters up to before running out of possible rewirings. pairwise transmission fitting In the case of fitting to an endemic state, we solve the algebraic equations generated by setting (11) in equations (8), giving a transmission rate that yields the default endemic equilibrium. each individual is set as infectious with probability (and conversely, the probability of being set susceptible is) treatment and cessation of tracing take place in the population at rates proportional to a number of individuals, and so fall into the former category. infection and contact tracing, on the other hand, are contact processes, and so take place at a rate proportional to a number of partnerships. we present a series of ODE systems that can be used in the context of network models, starting with mean-field approaches, and moving on to pairwise models. we have found that, for application to contact tracing, mean-field models and existing pairwise closures are inadequate and so we develop an improved pairwise model to study this system. consists of the unclosed equations (1) above, together with the following equations for pairs. the equations (3) are, like (1), exact, but to produce an integrable system it is necessary to introduce a system of spatial closure. two problems with the approximation (4) are particularly relevant for the question of contact tracing. we propose an alternative that respects (6) and has appropriate polynomial dependence on during the early epidemic. for the rest of this paper, we call pairwise models based on the closure (7) improved pairwise models. pairwise models based on (4) are called standard pairwise models. pairwise models are written down, leading to triple-level variables that are then closed in terms of pairs. the starting point for our analysis is the standard pairwise model for SIS dynamics [18], with transmission rate across a network link and treatment rate. the equations (3) are, like (1), exact, but to produce an integrable system it is necessary to introduce a system of spatial closure. the proportion of unclosed triples composed of three infected individuals is proportional to as expected. however, under (4), the proportion of triangles where all three individuals are infected is not small (and does not scale with); clearly, this is inconsistent and should be rectified in any improved closure. we use simple rewiring methods that are easily described. giant component sizes for networks generated using our methods typically exceed 99%. this means making the following network re-wiring for a \u2018V\u2019 of nodes. the implementation of such algorithms, and the differences between them and discrete-time equivalents, in the context of epidemic models is discussed in [28, Chapter 6]. the implementation of such algorithms, and the differences between them and discrete-time equivalents, in the context of epidemic models. tracing rates vary between 0 and 1, which then determines. each individual is set as infectious with probability. a random pair is chosen, and the susceptible individual is infected. a random pair is chosen, and the susceptible individual is infected. a random infectious individual is placed into the susceptible class. step 2 and 3 are repeated until spatial structure is equilibrated. the transmission rate is then given by. the results of Figure 2 were obtained by fitting the improved pairwise model to a given endemic state. the impact of this fitting on the transmission rate and number of pairs, while varying the clustering coefficient, is shown in panes C and D. -field and standard pairwise models predict a peak in infection before reaching the endemic state, which is not seen in either the improved pairwise model or simulation. this leaves the improved pairwise model, which we systematically compare to simulation in Panes C and D. level of infection is measured at times A, C: and B, D:. results are obtained in the improved pairwise model, with contact tracing success varied between 0 and 1. clustering can be expected to enhance the efficacy of contact tracing by increasing the neighbourhood size of the infected sub-network. the level of infection over time for different values of clustering is shown in Panes A and B, while in C and D the difference between clustered and unclustered is shown parametrically against the unclustered result. the difference between clustered and unclustered is shown parametrically against the unclustered result. the results of Figure 2 were obtained by fitting the improved pairwise model to a given endemic state. the impact of this fitting on the transmission rate and number of pairs is shown in Figure 2 panes C and D. the improved pairwise model is not seen in either the improved pairwise model or simulation. this leaves the improved pairwise model, which we systematically compare to simulation in Panes C and D. results are obtained in the improved pairwise model, with contact tracing success varied between 0 and 1. clustering increases the number of pairs present at a given endemic state, and contact tracing can be viewed as hyper-parasitism on the network of infected individuals. the level of infection over time for different values of clustering are shown in Panes A and B, while in C and D the difference between clustered and unclustered is shown parametrically against the unclustered result. the difference between clustered and unclustered is shown parametrically against the unclustered result. we see a final reversal of the impact of clustering in Pane B. our approach has been to consider the impact of clustering on a network with fixed, finite neighbourhood size. complexity of even our simplified problem provides justification for our approach. the full impact of higher order structure than triangles is also likely to be important."}
