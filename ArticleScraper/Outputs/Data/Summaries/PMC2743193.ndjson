{"summary": "antigenically disparate pulmonary viruses and the emergence of novel viruses assure the recurrence of lung damage with infection and resolution of each primary viral infection. there is a need to develop safe broad spectrum immunoprophylactic strategies capable of enhancing protective immune responses in the lung but which limits immune-mediated lung damage. the immunoprophylactic strategy described here uses a protein cage nanoparticle to significantly accelerate clearance of diverse respiratory viruses after primary infection. conventional strategies to protect against respiratory viral pathogens have relied on vaccination against individual virus strains or the use of drug based therapies. conventional strategies are generally not applicable to newly emerging viruses (SARS outbreak, 2003) since their sudden appearance does not allow for time to develop a vaccine. iBALT can replace the function of the spleen and other secondary lymphoid tissues in primary adaptive immune responses [7], [7] iBALT can be induced asymptomatically without infection or ensuing pathology, and accelerates the primary adaptive and likely innate immune responses to respiratory viruses in the nave host. iBALT can be induced asymptomatically without infection or ensuing pathology. the PCN-induced iBALT structures contained B cells, CD4 T cells, follicular dendritic cells and CD8 T cells. iBALT structures form in association with airways and blood vessels of the lung in response to 5 PCN treatments (A), whereas no iBALT structures were induced in response to 5 PBS treatments (B and C) mice treated with PCN were protected against a spectrum of respiratory viral pathogens. resolution of PR8 influenza virus infection is enhanced in mice treated with PCN prior to infection. PCN-treated mice did not lose body weight during resolution of subsequent influenza virus infection. no lung damage in association with the PCN treatment is evident. infection of mice with PVM results in a viral lung infection similar to that of humans. BALB/c mice were also treated with the human H-chain ferritin (HFn) protein cage. as a control, a group of mice were also treated with bovine serum albumin (BSA) the lack of any lung damage associated with the PCN treatment was further supported by the absence of any increase in the levels of serum albumin (Figure 3C) and lactate dehydrogenase (Figure 3D) recovered in the BALF of these mice at this time and the absence of any weight loss during the PCN treatment regimen. however, since it has already been demonstrated that novel small agents can act in an immunostimulatory role in the lung to enhance protective innate immune responses [14] against bacterial pathogens n = 5 mice per group; **, P = 0.001; **, P0.001; ***, P0.001. no difference in clearance of the C. burnetii infection from the lungs of the PCN-treated mice was detected. the presence of LPS is not a major contributor to the enhanced protection. the presence of LPS is not a major contributor to the enhanced protection. the small heat-shock PCNs are intrinsically immunomodulatory. PR8 influenza-specific serum IgG and IgA levels appear sooner and are more intense in the BALF of PCN-treated mice following infection; **, P = 0.0002; **,P0.0001. no differences in viral burdens in lungs of PCN-treated mice were detected. PCN-treated mice depleted of CD8 and/or CD4 T cells at 48 hours before and 4 days after influenza infection. CD4 and CD8 T cells accumulated more rapidly in the lungs of PCN-treated mice following infection. accelerated viral clearance was observed in PCN-treated mice that were depleted of CD8 and/or CD4 T cells. mice that had been treated with PCN (clear bars) or PBS (shaded bars) were rested for a designated period of time before being challenged with influenza virus. weight changes in PCN-treated mice (closed symbols) and the PBS-treated control mice (open symbols) were monitored during the week following influenza virus challenge. the following 4 types of bone marrow chimeric mice were made. chimeras that lacked secondary lymph nodes (20LN) and Peyers patches but could still form organized iBALT due to their lack of LT-. wild type control chimeras that retained 20LN and Peyers patches and could form organized iBALT. the PCN-treated wild type chimeric mice (filled squares) and SLP chimeric mice (filled circles) had significantly less virus in their lungs relative to their respective PBS-treated cohorts (open squares and open circles respectively) the extent of viral clearance in the PCN-treated WT/LT chimeric mice (filled triangles) and LT-KO chimeric mice (filled diamonds respectively) did not make organized iBALT [7]. PCN-induced iBALT structures formed in the submucosa adjacent to blood vessels and lymph ducts associated with bifurcations of the conducting airways down to the level of the terminal bronchioles. pulmonary instillation of the PCN induced iBALT development in the lung. PCN-induced iBALT structures contained CD4+ T cells, B220+ B cells (D) and CD21+ follicular dendritic cells (E) mice treated with PCN were protected against a spectrum of respiratory viral pathogens. accelerated viral clearance and reduced morbidity levels were found to be dose dependent. serum albumin and LDH levels in the recovered BALF of PCN treated mice (clear bars with lines) are significantly less than that detected in the PBS treated mice (shaded bars with lines); **, P = 0.003. PCN-treated mice survived the infection with minimal weight loss whereas all of the PBS-treated mice rapidly lost weight and died by day 4 post-infection. the small heat-shock PCN appears uniquely well suited to facilitate the enhancement of protection against a broad spectrum of respiratory viruses. all PCN-treated mice survived infection with SARS-coronavirus whereas all of the PBS-treated control mice were dead by day 4 post-infection. the formation of iBALT structures in the PCN-treated mice were indicative of the ability of the PCN to act as a pulmonary immunostimulatory agent. mice received a pulmonary challenge of 103 colony-forming units of the phase 1 variant of Coxiella burnetii. no difference in the rate of clearance of the C. burnetii infection was observed between the PBS-control and PCN-treatment groups. however, the pulmonary immune environment elicited by this PCN treatment regimen seems to be uniquely suited to enhancing the resolution of subsequent primary viral infections but not subsequent bacterial infections of the lung. the PCN was expressed and purified from an E. coli heterologous expression system. it is most likely to contain residual contaminating LPS. mice treated 3x or 5x with the PCN showed significantly reduced influenza viral burdens. PCN-treated wild type mice were treated with either PCN or PBS prior to infection with influenza virus. however, the PCN-treated uMT and wild type mice gained weight after infection. the protective effect of the PCN treatment against body weight loss is not wholly dependent on the presence of B cells. PBS-treated (shaded bars) wild type mice were depleted of CD8 and/or CD4 T cells at 48 hours before and 4 days after influenza infection. accelerated viral clearance was observed in PCN-treated mice that were depleted of CD8 and/or CD4 T cells. treated mice that were depleted of CD4 T cells or both CD4 and CD8 T cells. CD8 T cells do not play a significant role in enhanced protection against influenza infection. both B cells and CD4 T cells are critical for full protection. chimeric mice were reconstituted with BMC in order to make iBALT structures isolated from all other conventional secondary lymphoid tissues. wild type chimeric mice received wild type BMC (square symbols), WT/LT chimeric mice - LT KO mice that received wild type BMC (circle symbols) and LT KO mice that received LT KO BMC (diamond symbols) the following 4 types of bone marrow chimeric mice were made. chimeras that lacked secondary lymph nodes (20LN) and Peyers patches could still form organized iBALT. wild type control chimeras that retained 20LN and Peyers patches could form organized iBALT. there was no weight loss in any of the PCN-treated chimeric mice. together, these results indicate that organized secondary lymphoid tissues are not required for the PCN-induced enhancement of protection against influenza virus infections. however, pre-existing iBALT can exclusively account for the enhanced protection against the viral infection and is most likely also associated with the protection against weight loss. alterations to the immune environment of the lung in response to the PCN-treatment had no effect on the resolution of pulmonary bacterial infections. the immunomodulatory effects elicited by the PCN-treatment are dependent on B cells and CD4 T cells, but not on either CD8 T cells or conventional secondary lymphoid tissues such as the spleen. induction of iBALT in response to treatment with PCN represents a promising strategy for pulmonary immunoprophylaxis. the ability to non-specifically enhance immune protection against a variety of respiratory viruses underscores the potential effectiveness of this strategy against infections by antigenic variants of currently circulating viruses. x31 (X31; H3N2) were obtained from the Trudeau Institute, Saranac Lake, NY, USA. work with the murine adapted SARS-CoV was carried out by Dr. Dale Barnard. the cloning, characterization and purification of the small heat-shock protein (sHsp 16.5) was carried out in an E. coli expression vector as described previously [17]. the purified PCN was then stored at 80\u00b0C until used. mice were under a light anesthesia using 5% isoflurane inhalation. recovery of broncho-alveolar lavage fluids (BALF) was obtained by washing the lungs with 2.0 ml of 3 mM EDTA in HBSS in two aliquots of 1 ml. recovered fluid was then stored at 80\u00b0C for future use in determining levels of serum albumin, lactate dehydrogenase, and influenza-specific antibody. 100 ul aliquots of a 1/100 dilution of serum or 100 ul aliquots of the BALF were added to 96-well high binding polystyrene ELISA plates. the plates were allowed to incubate for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. presence of bound Ab was detected by the addition of p-nitrophenyl phosphate in diethanolamine buffer and visualized at 405 nm. mice were given an intranasal challenge of 20 ug ova in PBS for 3 consecutive days. mice were bred at Montana State University, Bozeman, MT. mice were generated by bone marrow reconstitution of irradiated mice. splenectomized recipient mice were gamma irradiated with 2 doses of 475 rads administered 4 h apart. the recipient mice were immediately reconstituted by intravenous tail injection of 2107 congenic CD45.1+ or CD45.2+ donor bone marrow cells (BMC) the animals then rested for 5 weeks to allow for the establishment of the engrafted bone marrow cells. Coxiella burnetii infections were carried out using 103 genomic equivalents of the phase 1 variant. mice were sacrificed by intraperitoneal administration of a lethal dose of sodium pentobarbital (90 mg/kg) followed by exsanguination when mice no longer exhibited a pedal reflex. color absorbency was read at 630 nm and reported in mg/ml of the BALF. each of the samples was tested in duplicate. depletion of CD4 and CD8 T cell subsets was accomplished by intraperitoneal injection of specific monoclonal antibodies. the presence of bound Ab was detected by the addition of p-nitrophenyl phosphate in diethanolamine buffer and visualized at 405 nm. the assay was then allowed to incubate at 35\u00b0C for 3\u20134 days prior to being fixed in 20% acetic acid and stained with 0.2% crystal violet to reveal the presence of viral plaques. dotted line is limit of assay detection; ***, P0.0001, **, P0.005, *, P0.05 relative to PBS group (0 ug PCN) resistance to infection by X31 influenza virus or pneumovirus of mice is enhanced in mice treated with PCN prior to viral challenge. mice treated with PCN prior to viral challenge did not lose body weight. mice receiving alternative treatments lose body weight. dotted line is limit of detection in assay. mice were treated 5x with the PCN or PBS-control on every 4th day. on the day after the last intranasal ovalbumin injection, all mice were subjected to a methacholine challenge. penh values for doses greater than 10 mg/ml methacholine were not taken."}
