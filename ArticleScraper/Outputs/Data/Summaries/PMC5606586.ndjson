{"summary": "the intestinal epithelium is an extremely large mucosal surface with an extreme self-renewing capacity. the canine intestine for medium sized dogs is about 4.5 m in length. it is subdivided into five functional domains along the proximal-to-distal axis. ISCs reside near the bottom of the intestinal crypt. their rapidly dividing, transit-amplifying (TA) daughter cells occupy the remainder of the crypts and flow onto the flanks of the villi. they differentiate, absorb nutrients, and eventually die at the villus tips. crypt base columnar cells are the proliferative engines that drive cellular production in the crypts. +4 cells have been redefined as reserve or quiescent ISCs. they divide infrequently under homeostatic conditions but can produce new CBC cells in response to injury or other stimuli. p35 encodes a member of the ephrin-B receptor subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases; FZD5, Frizzled. it was originally identified as a Wingless-related integration site (Wnt) target gene encoding an orphan G-protein-coupled receptor in colorectal cancer cell-lines. the consideration that Lgr5 is a robust marker of intestinal stem cells was further substantiated by ex vivo mTert expression marks a slowly cycling ISC population distinct from Lgr5+ cells. mTert+ cells contribute to all differentiated intestinal cells. mTert+ cells contribute to all differentiated intestinal cells. a slowly cycling stem cell exists within the intestine alongside, and perhaps upstream of, the Lgr5+ population. OLFM4 is highly expressed in crypt base columnar cells in human small intestine and colon. it is expressed in cells within adenocarcinomas of the colon. distinct levels of SOX9 in the intestinal epithelium are associated with both proliferative and postmitotic cell types. the receptor tyrosine kinase EphB2 is expressed in a decreasing gradient from the crypt base toward the differentiated cell compartment. nt signaling is crucial for normal stem cell function in the intestinal epithelium. neurogenin 3 (NEUROG3) has been investigated as a candidate gene responsible for congenital loss of intestinal enteroendocrine cells in humans. the intestinal enteroendocrine cells consist of at least 15 different cells classified essentially on the basis of their hormonal content with a specific geographical distribution. notch is clearly active in ISCs and stimulates proliferation while blocking secretory cell differentiation. ch signaling identified long-lived progenitors that gave rise to all the mature epithelial cell types. notch regulation of the CBC stem cell was suggested by the enrichment of notch1 receptor mRNA in this cell type [28] 58-flanking region of the MUC2 gene has been isolated as well, and has been shown to have promoter activity in cultured cells. intestinal crypts contain human adult stem cells. they can be isolated from surgically resected tissue or from biopsies. these cultures produce polarized three-dimensional spheroid-like structures. these are referred to as enteroids (derived from small intestine) or colonoids (derived from colon) and contain only epithelial cells types. matrigel based culture system was established that allows formation of ever-expanding organoids, or \u2018\u2018mini-guts\u2019, in vitro from a single Lgr5+ stem cell. the other constituents are epidermal growth factor (EGF) and the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) inhibitor Noggin. cells are born in the crypts proliferate, differentiate, and are shed into the central lumen about five days later. the isolated crypts require Matrigel (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), a 3D laminin-and collagen-rich matrix that mimics the basal lamina. single crypts can be readily isolated from mouse or human intestine by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-based Ca2+/Mg epithelial mini-guts grown from adenomatous polyposis coli display the same symmetric shape. the typical crypt-villus architecture is suppressed under conditions of homogeneous (rather than focal) Wnt signaling. the addition of Rspo1, Noggin, and epidermal growth factor (EGF) did not maintain the growth of mouse colonic crypts. organoids have been described in numerous tissues form humans and mice [36] and only one paper described canine liver organoids [37] organoids have been used to model human genetic diseases, infections, inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and malignancies. RNA-mediated knockdown using lipophilic transfection reagents and virus mediated transduction. these new models may provide valuable insight into developing methodologies for intestinal regeneration. the in vivo transplantation in humans remains a challenge. spheroids were transferred into a retinoic acid-supplemented Matrigel culture. virulence factor CagA bound and activated the c-Met (receptor for HGF), inducing epithelial proliferation. this epithelial pathophysiological response makes the organoids a promising model for human gastric disease. studies involving molecularly characterized intestinal organoids in dogs are lacking. a task-force at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine of the Utrecht University (Utrecht) was created to fill this gap."}
