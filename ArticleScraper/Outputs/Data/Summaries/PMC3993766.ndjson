{"summary": "RNA viruses have relatively small genomes, probably due to their high mutation rate (1) and to capsid size constraints (2). their genomic RNA encodes few proteins, sometimes with overlapping segments, and contains many noncoding sequences (3). viral RNA properties relying on global features such as nucleotide composition have also been revealed to be crucial in virus biology (7, 8) in the last years, several groups have synthesized large artificial viral sequences to proceed to genome-scale modifications. poliovirus RNA genome was deoptimized without altering the amino acid sequence by changing synonymous codons from frequently to rarely used codons. this resulted in imbalanced synthesis of viral proteins and generated attenuated viruses. we proposed a putative link between pathogenicity and divergent nucleotide composition of HIV-1 compared to host (27). this results suggested a new determinant for the pathogenicity of lentiviral infections and raised the possibility of altering virus-host interactions by artificially changing the nucleotide frequency of the viral genome. a threshold of maximum acceptable chi-square divergence was selected. the selected thresholds were 0.04 in the gag region, 0.14 in the pol region, and 0.05 in the env region. each region was divided into peaks of divergence separated from nondivergent sections. nucleotide divergence of SIVmac239 RNA with that of the rhesus macaque correlates with the ability to stimulate IFN-I. nucleotide divergence correlates with luciferase activity (R = 0.36, P 0.02) human and macaque PBMCs and cemx174 cells were grown in RPMI medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) heLa P4C5 (33) and HEK293T cells and derivatives were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS. mutated env-optimized DNA sequences were chemically synthesized (GeneScript) and then clo two days after transfection, DMEM was replaced by 3 ml RPMI\u201310% FBS containing 5 105/ml Cemx174 cells. culture supernatant was harvested, centrifuged at low speed, and filtrated trough 0.45-m pores. PCR products were purified and used as the template for T7 RNA synthesis. cells were transfected using 1 l Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with pIFN-Luc reporter plasmid (250 ng/well) and a plasmid harboring a thymidine kinase promoter upstream of the renilla luciferase gene. after 24 h, cells were lysed, and the firefly and renilla luciferase activities were measured in cell ly IFN-I secretion was quantified using the reporter cell line HL116. cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine (HAT; H, 20 g/ml; T, 20 g/ml; A, 0.2 g/ml; 0.2 g/ml) Isotype-matched monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were used as negative controls. samples were analyzed using a FacsCalibur (Becton, Dickinson) or a FacsCanto II (Becton, Dickinson) instrument. chi-square divergence of nucleotide composition between virus and rhesus macaque host was computed with a sliding window of 101 nucleotides. each region was divided into peaks of divergence separated from nondivergent sections. each region was divided into peaks of divergence separated from nondivergent sections. the single nucleotide modification causing the higher diminution of divergence was selected. after each modification, the chi-square profile of the peak was recomputed. the next peak was then solved iteratively until resolution of all peaks inside each region was achieved. human and macaque PBMCs and cemx174 cells were isolated from healthy donors by Ficoll centrifugation. the blood was provided by the EFS (etablissement Fran\u00e7ais du Sang) or env genes were digested with SphI (p239Sp5) or SphI + AatII (p239SpE3\u2032 nef Open), purified on agarose gel, and ligated together with T4 DNA ligase for 48 h at 4\u00b0C. the total ligation product (40 l) was transfected with 6 l Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) in 8 105 HEK293 reporter plasmid pISRE-Luc containing five interferon-stimulated response elements (ISRE) upstream of the firefly luciferase gene (Stratagene) or reporter plasmid pIFN-Luc containing the firefly luciferase gene under the control of the IFN- promoter. after 24 h, cells were lysed, and the firefly and renilla luciferase activities were pIFN-Luc reporter plasmid (200 ng/well) and a plasmid harboring a thymidine kinase promoter upstream of the renilla luciferase gene (20 ng/well) one day later, infected Cemx174 cells were added to the culture at a concentration of 106 cells per ml. cells were stained with anti-SIV Gag p27 (Clone 55-2F12) and anti-human MxA (from O. Haller) cells were fixed for 10 min with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 4% paraformaldehyde, washed, permeabilized, and stained for 45 min in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.05% saponin. Western blot (WB) analysis was performed using rabbit anti-IRF3 (Clone FL-425; Santa Cruz) the optimized sequences determined in this study are available from GenBank under accession number KJ152770 for SIVopt1. RNA fragments were cotransfected into HEK293T cells together with a reporter plasmid expressing the luciferase gene under the control of five interferon-stimulated response elements (ISRE-luciferase) the response was determined by measuring luciferase activity 24 h after transfection. RNA derived from HIV pol gene was the most potent stimulator of IFN-I. codon optimization of viral RNAs modulates their ability to stimulate IFN-I. luciferase expression reflecting IFN-I stimulation after transfection of RNA fragments transcribed in vitro from wild type (wt) or optimized (opt) viral sequences from different origins. the most biased regions of the SIV genome are the most potent IFN-I stimulators. the most divergent regions locate within the three large viral genes. the most divergent regions locate within the three large viral genes. overlapping coding regions and cis-active regulatory sequences are not biased. the ability of each fragment to induce IFN-I correlated significantly. a synthetic SIV with a nucleotide composition optimized to be closer to its host would have a reduced capacity to stimulate IFN-I. we used the original SIVMM239 sequence available at GenBank (accession number M33262). three regions on the SIVmac239 genome to be optimized to the macaque average nucleotide composition. each region was divided into short domains of nucleotide divergence. synonymous mutations were locally computed to reduce divergence. wild-type SIV (SIVwt) and optimized SIV strains were produced after transfection of reconstituted proviral DNA into HEK293 cells. no replicating virus was obtained with optimized env or optimized gag and pol (SIVopt2). nucleotide modification does not impair the viral replication kinetics of SIVwt and SIVopt1 in macaque PBMCs. stability of attenuated synthetic viruses is of uttermost importance to prevent reversion. compared samples from 7 human PBMC donors, we found that SIVopt1 had a slightly reduced capacity to stimulate MxA expression compared to SIVwt. this effect is not due to a difference in replication between the two viruses (paired Wilcoxon test, P = 0.07, calculated for 7 donor samples at each time point on more than 150 pairs) each PBMC donor sample was divided into several cultures. SIVopt1 globally stimulated less MxA synthesis than SIVwt. paired Wilcoxon test, P = 3. 105 on more than 150 pairs. we first controlled whether our optimization algorithm decreased the capacity of SIV RNA to induce IFN-I in this cell line. we produced in vitro-transcribed RNA from the Pol region of SIVwt and SIVopt1. pol RNA induced a reduced IFN- response compared to wt RNA. induction of IFN-I in HeLa P4C5 cells transfected with IFN--luciferase reporter plasmid and cocultured for 16 h with CEMx174 cells infected by SIVwt or SIVopt1. the fold induction of luciferase activity compared to that in nonstimulated cells is shown (y axis) cytosolic sensors play a role in the detection of SIV-infected cells. codon optimization of viral RNAs abolishes their ability to induce IFN-I. the nucleotide composition of HIV-1 RNA can modulate IFN-I stimulation in human cells. a weak positive correlation between optimal codon usage and gene expression levels is found. RNA derived from HIV pol gene was the most potent stimulator of IFN-I, and RNAs from HCV were the least stimulatory. RNAs derived from viral genes stimulate IFN-I, while codon optimization decreases this property. projection of the luciferase expression indicates which nucleotide is enriched in each direction on the graph. wt viral genes are either A or U rich, with exception of HCV genes. most optimized versions are G/C rich. we measured the ability of a set of 40 overlapping RNA fragments of approximately 500 bp, covering the entire genome of SIVmac239, to induce IFN-I in vitro. Activating fragments were found mostly clustered in the pol region, the 5\u2032 region of Gag, and the 3\u2032 region of env. we then looked for the repartition of local nucleotide bias on the whole genome. we used the original SIVMM239 sequence available at GenBank (accession number M33262) to reduce the major peaks of nucleotide divergence while preserving the amino acid sequence. from the literature available on the genome and by homology with known regulatory sequences of the HIV-1 genome, we excluded from the optimized regions. esized (GeneScript) and subcloned in replacement of wt counterparts into p239Sp5 and p239SpE3\u2032 nef Open plasmids that contain, respectively, the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 halves of the SIVmac239 infectious clone (34) no replicating virus was obtained with optimized gag and pol (SIVwt) alone. SIVwt and SIVopt1 showed the same replicative kinetics in both Cemx174 and PBMCs. a 100-fold-higher viral input was needed for SIVopt2 to reach viral peak on day 8 after infection. in cemx174 cells, a 100-fold-higher viral input was needed. one mutation common to the three passaged viruses was found in the 5\u2032-long terminal repeat (LTR) other mutations were found in different regions of the genome. however, no reversion was observed in the optimized regions of optimized viruses. the effect indicates a reduced ability of SIVopt1 to induce IFN-I. a molecular sensor involved in innate sensing and the IFN-I response is able to detect the difference between SIVwt and SIVopt1. PBMCs were infected by SIVwt or SIVopt1. we used a coculture system consisting of infected Cemx174 lymphocytes and HeLa cell line-derived reporter cells (P4C5 cells expressing SIV receptors CD4 and CCR5 [47]) transfected with a luciferase gene under the control of IFN- promoter (IFN-luc) this system allows investigation of the cytoplasmic sensing of viral RNA after cell-to-cell contact, which is a major mode of virus spreading in IFN-I stimulation was measured in cells cotransfected with IFN--luciferase reporter plasmid and SIVwt or SIVopt1 Pol RNA sequence. the fold induction of luciferase activity was lost in cells expressing BVDV-Pro (which cleaves IRF3). the paramyxovirus Sendai virus (SeV) was used as a positive control. we then evaluated the induction of IFN--luciferase when cemx174 cells were cocultured with P4C5 reporter cells. luciferase induction was directly related to the percentage of SIV-infected cells in the coculture. IRF3 abrogated the activation of IFN- upon RNA transfection. this observation indicates that cytosolic sensors play a role in the detection of SIV-infected cells. the origin of nucleotide and codon bias has been extensively debated. the use of optimized viral genes in genetic vaccines strategies could be reevaluated. we identified local A-rich regions of SIV genes as strong stimulators of IFN-I. the resulting SIVopt1 was growing as efficiently as SIVwt in a T-cell line and PBMCs. a report published while we were preparing the manuscript (60) describes the use of the synthetic attenuated virus engineering (SAVE) approach (24) to generate optimized and deoptimized HIV-1. optimized viruses remained stable but were not attenuated (60) upstream of IRF3, the cytosolic RLR (RIG-I-like receptor) helicases RIG-I and MDA5 directly recognize multiple and distinct forms of intracellular double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) ligands include short 5\u2032-triphosphate RNAs with double-stranded structures. differences observed between the recognition of SIVopt1 and SIVwt raise the question of the nature of the viral ligand involved. original vaccine strategies are desired to reproduce protection efficacy of attenuated viruses without retaining associated risks. mutations artificially introduced in SIVopt1 (70 mutations) and SIVopt2 (169 mutations) did not revert after 10 weeks of culture on Cemx174 cells."}
