{"summary": "MERS-CoV causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like human respiratory disease. as of 6 October 2013, it has caused 136 confirmed human infections. it has caused 58 deaths, a case fatality rate of 43%. cAMP regulates diverse biological responses by activating several members of the Ras superfamily. Epac exists as two isoforms, Epac-1 and Epac-2, which are coded by different genes. alternative splicing adds to the complexity of the differential expression profile of Epac both on the mRNA and protein levels. prior treatment with ESI-09, but not H89, attenuated CPE formation (data not shown) and significantly reduced viral yields (P 0.001). a significant reduction in virus yield occurred when cells were treated with ESI-09 at the concentrations between 5 and 40 M in Calu-3 cells. DMSO control and H89 treatment did not protect against MERS-CoV infection. in contrast, Calu-3 cells treated with ESI-09 were almost fully protected. prior ESI-09, but not H89, treatment was also effective in protecting cell cultures against SARS-CoV. the lactate dehydrogenase-based cytotoxicity assay (Promega) was used to evaluate the drug's cytotoxic potential. confluent Calu-3 and Vero E6 cells grown in 6-well plates were incubated with the indicated concentrations of ESI-09 for 24 h. cells incubated with 50 M DMSO were included as controls. cell-free supernatants harvested at 24 h p.i. were used to determine yields of MERS-CoV. confluent Vero E6 cells grown in 12-well plates were similarly subjected to treatment with 10 M DMSO, H89, or ESI-09 prior to infection with SARS-CoV. washed thoroughly with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove unbound viruses and submitted to one cycle of freeze (80\u00b0C)-thaw in 100 l of minimal essential medium (MEM)-2% fetal calf serum (FCS) medium. neither ESI-09 treatment adversely influenced MERS-CoV binding to Calu-3 cells. kinetics of viral RNA replication was consistent with expression of spike-surface glycoproteins (S) and the nucleocapsid (N) protein. this suggests that inhibiting viral RNA replication and protein synthesis are likely antiviral mechanisms of ESI-09. cAMP-Epac, but not cAMP-PKA, signaling axis plays a role in regulation of MERS-CoV replication in permissive cells. incubated with MERS-CoV (MOI of 20) in an ice bath for 2 h. were subjected to 1 cycle of freeze-thaw before the titers of membrane-bound viral particles were determined. effects of ESI-09 treatment on viral RNA replication and protein expression over time were also evaluated. lentiviral transduction system (Sigma-Aldrich) (25) infected control and control KD cells with either MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV (MOI of 0.1) for 24 h before assessing virus yields. reducing Epac-1 expression by 50% was sufficient to significantly reduce the replication of both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. the activity state of Epac is determined by its allosteric interaction with cAMP (16), an increased transcriptional expression of Epac gene has been demonstrated in mice suffered from either myocardial hypertrophy or neointima formation induced by vascular injury. we determined whether its expression could be modified in response to acute MERS-CoV infection. the expression pattern and intensity of Epac in Calu-3 cells was not affected by either MERS-CoV infection or ESI-09 treatment. Neither ESI-09 treatment nor MERS-CoV infection affects the expression and localization of Epac protein in Calu-3 cells. DAPI was used to stain the nucleus of cells (blue) DAPI was used to stain the nucleus of cells (blue) DMSO-treated cells, MERS-CoV-RFP expression (red, arrowhead) in DMSO-treated (c to e) or ESI-09-treated (i to k) cells. cell culture supernatants were harvested for assessing protective efficacy at either 38 h (MOI of 0.1) or 24 h (MOI of 5) postchallenge. the effectiveness of such a delayed ESI-09 treatment in plunging yields of virus in Calu-3 cells suggests that this antiviral drug might affect a late event(s) of the virus replication strategy. equal aliquots of MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV stocks were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2 h with an equal volume of MEM-2% fetal calf serum (FCS) medium or 20 M either DMSO or ESI-09 for a final concentration of 10 M each. resulting supernatants were tested for virus yield at 24 h p.i. ESI-09 exerts an antiviral effect when used at a nontoxic concentration. adenosine and its analogs have been successfully investigated as potent inhibitors of the replication of hepatitis C virus, vaccinia virus, HIV-1, dengue virus, and other flaviviruses."}
