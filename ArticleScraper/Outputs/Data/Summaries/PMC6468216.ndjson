{"summary": "the incidence rates of cancers (2001-2014), communicable diseases (2003-2016) and non-communicable diseases (1990-2017) were retrieved, classified, and analyzed retrospectively during November 2017 based on data available with the Ministry of Health. colorectal cancer incidence was the highest among men and its ASR per 100,000 population increased from 5.0 to 10.6 in men and from 5.0 to 8.2 in women. ectal cancer, thyroid cancer, non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL) and leukemia according to gender for the period 2001\u20132014 were extracted from the Saudi Cancer Registry during November, 2017. data were segregated based on cancer type and gender, and age-standardized incidence rate (ASR) per 100,000 population was plotted according to gender for the period between 2001\u20132014. the age-standardized incidence rate (ASR) per 100,000 population of breast cancer (A), colorectal cancer (B), thyroid cancer (C), non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (C), and leukemia (E) is shown over a decade. the prevalence of non-communicable diseases such as diabetes (A), hypertension (B), hypercholesterolemia (C), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (D) and obesity (E) is shown over a decade incidence rate of hepatitis B, dengue fever, measles, chickenpox, and brucellosis decreased from 19.65 in 2003 to 13.63 in 2016. incidence rate of dengue fever per 100,000 population remarkably increased from 1.52 in 2004 to 17.10 in 2016. incidence rate of chickenpox per 100,000 population drastically decreased from 5.48 in 2003 to 14.25 in 2016. prevalence of diabetes increased from 9.7% in 1970-1979 to 26.2% in 2000-2009 among men the prevalence of obesity was increased from 22% in 1990-1993 to 36% in 2005. the prevalence of obesity was 24.1% in males and 14% in females. in tabuk, male obesity was 18.1%. incidence rate of dengue fever per 100,000 population decreased from 1.52 in 2004 to 17.10 in 2016. incidence rate of chickenpox per 100,000 population drastically decreased from 5.48 in 2003 to 0.39 in 2016. incidence rate of brucellosis per 100,000 population drastically decreased from 20.58 in 2001 to 12.80 in 2016. prevalence of diabetes increased from 9.7% in 1970-1979 to 26.2% in 2000-2009 among men and 28.6% among women in 2010-2017. study assessed the trends in the incidence rate of 5 most common cancers, communicable diseases, and non-communicable diseases in Saudi Arabia. in the united states, literate women are more likely to undergo a mammography. the increase in the number of reported cases of colorectal cancer in the last 5 years is merely due to an increase in the size of the population. but not an increase in the incidence rate which has fluctuated between 9-10/100,0000 and this is different from the rate in the 1990\u2019s. the mean age at diagnosis for thyroid cancer is 50 years in men and 42 years in women, which is significantly low. in 1989-1990, all Saudi Arabian individuals aged 34 years were vaccinated at birth or at school. this has steadily decreased the incidence of hepatitis B in Saudi Arabia. except for an unknown increase in the incidence of measles, there has been a decrease in the incidence of other communicable diseases in Saudi Arabia. the prevalence of chronic non-communicable diseases has increased in most countries, including Saudi Arabia, and is likely to increase further. a shift in attitude toward regular exercise, proper food habits, and physical activity may be beneficial in ensuring better health of the Saudi Arabian population. the key components of such programs are to promote awareness about the burden of non-communicable diseases, improve surveillance, train public health professionals, and increase healthcare capacity building. leading causes of poor health in Saudi Arabia in 2003 are compared with those in recent years (2014)."}
