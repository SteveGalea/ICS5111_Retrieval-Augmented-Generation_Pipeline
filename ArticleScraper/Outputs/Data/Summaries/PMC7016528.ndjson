{"summary": "piglets are at the highest risk, with mortality rates as high as 80% for suckling pigs and nearly 100% for newborns. piglets are at the highest risk, with mortality rates as high as 80% for suckling pigs. most commensal bacteria, including Fusobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Enterococcus, were found to be more abundant in PEDV-infected pigs than in healthy ones. some bacteria were common across all healthy piglets, but were not detected in diarrheal piglets. piglets with and without diarrhea symptoms were selected from sow stalls within 7\u20139 d after birth. the results identified ten PEDV-infected pigs and eight healthy pigs. a total of thirty-six samples were collected from the colonic mucosa of healthy piglets (CoMH, n = 8), the colonic content of healthy piglets (CoCH, n = 8) and infected piglets (CoCD, n = 10). the total reaction volume was 30 L, containing 15 L Phusion High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix. 98 \u00b0C for 1 min followed by 30 cycles of 98 \u00b0C for 10 s, 50 \u00b0C for 30 s, and 72 \u00b0C for 60 s. samples were pooled for high-throughput sequencing of bacterial rRNA genes. the composition of each sample community was determined at the phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species level. the beta diversity per group was calculated using principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) based on weighted UniFrac distances [31,32] in QIIME version 1.8.0 [25] the results identified ten PEDV-infected pigs and eight healthy pigs. a total of thirty-six samples were collected from the colonic mucosa of healthy piglets (CoMH, n = 8), the colonic content of healthy piglets (CoCH, n = 8) and the colonic content of healthy piglets (CoCH, n = 8). 98 \u00b0C for 1 min followed by 30 cycles of 98 \u00b0C for 10 s, 50 \u00b0C for 30 s, and 72 \u00b0C for 60 s. samples were pooled for high-throughput sequencing of bacterial rRNA genes using the Illumina Hiseq 2500 platform. the beta diversity per group was calculated using principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) based on weighted UniFrac distances [31,32] in QIIME version 1.8.0 [25]. between-sample differences in evolutionary information were determined using the unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic mean. different letters denote significant differences in alpha diversity indices. Firmicutes, Fusobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes were the top four phyla in all groups. microorganism structure differed more between healthy and infected groups. piglets, Fusobacterium, Bacteroides, and Lactobacillus were dominant. the proportions of Fusobacterium in the infected groups were 36.56% (CoMD) and 21.61% (CoCD), while in the healthy groups they were 22.53% (CoMH) and 12.67% (CoCH) Variations in the Colonic Microbiota of the Healthy and PEDV-Infected Piglets PCoA revealed variations between the microbiome profiles within each group based upon Bray Curtis dissimilarity. Coordinate 1 (45.14% of variation) was associated with disease status (healthy or infected) and sample location (colonic content or mucosa) samples from healthy and PEDV infected pigs showed more distant separation, while samples from the same group were more similar. the proportion of Proteobacteria was 3.92 fold higher in the infected groups than that in the healthy groups. the proportion of Bacteroidetes was 4.25 fold higher in the healthy groups than in the infected groups. the top annotations were General function prediction only, Carbohydrate transport and metabolism, Amino acid transport and metabolism, and Transcription. in both colonic content and mucosa, Amino acid transport and metabolism and Cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis enrichment differed between the healthy and diseased groups. Firmicutes, Fusobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes were the top four phyla in all groups, representing approximately 95% of the sequences. microorganism structure differed more between healthy and infected groups than between colonic content and mucosa. the proportions of Fusobacterium in the infected groups were 36.56% (CoMD) and 21.61% (CoCD), whereas in the healthy groups they were 22.53% (CoMH) and 12.67% (CoCH). the Bacteroides percentages in the healthy piglets were 17.35% (CoMH) and 14.03% (CoCH) coordinate 1 (45.14% of variation) was associated with disease status (healthy or infected) and sample location (colonic content or mucosa) samples from healthy and PEDV infected pigs showed more distant separation, while samples from the same group were more similar. teobacteria was 3.92 fold higher in the infected groups than that in the healthy groups. the proportion of Bacteroidetes was 4.25 fold higher in the healthy groups than in the healthy groups. six annotations differed between the CoCD and CoCH groups. five differed between the CoMD and CoMH groups. the gut microbiota of PEDV-infected piglets exhibit significant changes. microorganisms in the cecum and colon produce SCFAs that are beneficial to host health. sensitivity may generate individual differences in microorganisms, even in piglets from the same cohort. Fusobacteria increases have previously been observed in the feces of PEDV-infected suckling pigs. this phylum is associated with various clinical anaerobic infections in humans. it is positively correlated with catarrhal appendicitis on the mucosal surface. microbial profiles are useful as specific biomarkers for distinguishing between healthy and infected piglets. the relevant microbes mainly belonged to Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Epsilonbacteraeota. the timely treatment of PEDV-induced diarrhea and vomiting can effectively reduce mortality in newborn piglets. regulating intestinal microbiota is a promising method for PED treatment."}
