{"summary": "fully human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) provide an attractive method to rapidly produce therapeutics for emerging diseases. we obtained specific anti-ebola virus antibodies by immunizing VelocImmune mice that use human immunoglobulin variable regions in their humoral responses. vero E6 (monkey kidney epithelial cells, obtained from ATCC) were grown in minimal essential media. supplemented with 10% v/v FBS (Sigma Aldrich), 1% l-glutamine (Gibco) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gemini Bio Products) at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. the abundance of the genomes possess 7U at the editing site locus is 94.3%. the abundance of the genomes possess 7U at the editing site locus is 94.3%. the most potent antibodies for binding, neutralization, and FcRIIIa signaling were selected for subsequent analysis. the most potent antibodies for binding, neutralization, and FcRIIIa signaling were selected for subsequent analysis. data analysis was performed using the Octet HTX system equipped with anti-His sensors (Pall ForteBio) Experiments were performed at 25\u00b0C in HBS-EP Octet buffer. the fragment antigen-binding agents (Fab) were purified using a Protein A column (GE Healthcare) followed by size exclusion chromatography with an S200I column (GE Healthcare) the Fabs were added to mucin-like, domain-containing, transmembrane-deleted Ebola GP (EBOV GPTM) in 10 molar excess and allowed to incubate overnight at 4\u00b0C. complexes were deposited on thin carbon-coated, retrovirus particles pseudotyped with EBOV GP protein were generated by cotransfecting 293T cells with a mix of plasmids encoding EBOV GP, psPAX2 and pCK-retro-luc. supernatants were harvested 48 hours posttransfection, clarified using centrifugation, concentrated using Lenti-X Concentrator (Clontech), aliquoted. vero cells were plated on 384-well plates in DMEM-10% FBS. the concentration of each antibody ranged from 25 to 0.006 g/mL. plates were transferred to a biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) laboratory. plates were incubated with 25 L/well of Hoechst dye (1:50000 in 1 PBS) for 30 minutes at RT. the rate of infection was determined by dividing the number of cells with the total number of cells. anti-EBOV GP mAbs, mAb cocktail, or IgG1 isotype control antibody were added to the cells at a 1:1 ratio (30000 cells each) they were incubated at 37\u00b0C, 5.0% CO2 for 5.5 hours, followed by equilibration at RT. the EESYR CHO cell line is derived from CHO cells (CHO cell line, obtained from ATCC) the Makona strain of EBOV was originally isolated by Dr. Stephan Gunther [20] and was obtained with permission through Dr. Gary Kobinger. the abundance of the genomes possess 7U at the editing site locus is 94.3%. a stock of the virus was provided by Dr. Heinrich Feldman. pCK-retro-luc was described before [22]. binding, neutralization, and FcRIIIa signaling were selected for subsequent analysis. antibodies were purified from culture supernatants by protein A affinity chromatography. clinical-grade antibody was further processed via nonaffinity column chromatography and dedicated virus removal/inactivation steps. data analysis was performed using the Octet HTX system equipped with anti-His sensors (Pall ForteBio) Experiments were performed at 25\u00b0C in HBS-EP Octet buffer. the Fabs were added to mucin-like, domain-containing, transmembrane-deleted Ebola GP (EBOV GPTM) in 10 molar excess and allowed to incubate overnight at 4\u00b0C. complexes were deposited on thin carbon-coated, 400-mesh Cu grids and stained with 2% (w/v) uranyl formate. images were collected automatically using Leginon [23] with Tietz TemC es retrovirus particles pseudotyped with EBOV GP protein were generated by cotransfecting 293T cells with a mix of plasmids encoding EBOV GP, psPAX2 encoding virus capside proteins. supernatants were harvested 48 hours posttransfection, clarified using centrifugation, concentrated using Lenti-X Concentrator (Clontech), aliquoted, and frozen at 80\u00b0C. Vero cells were plated on 384-well plates in DMEM-10% FBS. the concentration of each antibody ranged from 25 to 0.006 g/mL. plates were transferred to a biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) laboratory. the rate of infection was determined by dividing the number of infected cells with the total number of cells. infection rates were normalized to the average untreated cell infection rate, and normalized infection rates were expressed as percentage of infectivity versus antibody concentration. plates were washed 3 times in 1 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) cells were permeabilized at RT with 25 L 0.1% Triton X-100 in 1 PBS for 15\u201320 minutes. the detergent containing buffer was discarded, and the plates were blocked with 3.5% BSA in 1 PBS for 1 hour. the rate of infection was determined by dividing the number of infected cells with the total number of cells. the rate of infection was determined by dividing the number of infected cells with the total number of cells. individual anti-EBOV GP mAbs, mAb cocktail, or IgG1 isotype control antibody were added to the cells at a concentration range from 0.78 pM to 40 nM. an equal volume of ONE-Glo luciferase substrate was added to each well, and the plate was incubated at RT for 20 minutes. no analgesics for clinical signs of disease were used because the use of analgesics may have a secondary effect of masking clinical signs of infection that would prevent evaluation of disease severity. there may also be secondary unintended consequences with interactions between the candidate drug and the analgesic. animal studies were performed in a BSL-4 laboratory at TBRI or USAMRIID. veterinary staff were blinded to treatment status of all animals until the end of studies. guinea pigs were randomly assigned to treatment groups with 6 animals per group. all animals were challenged intramuscularly in the caudal thigh with a target dose of 1000 pfu EBOV (Kikwit, 7U) antibody treatments were administered in a single bolus of less than 30 mL over approximately 60 seconds. agarose (SeaKem ME Agarose; Lonza, Rockland, ME) solution. after 1 week at 37\u00b0C, cells were again overlain with neutral red. the same process was repeated to enumerate each animal\u2019s viremia. serum was serially diluted and the plaque assay performed as described above. all of the animals were challenged intraperitoneally with a target dose of 1000 pfu of guinea pig-adapted EBOV Kikwit. each group was treated intravenously with 50 or 150 mg/kg of an antibody cocktail or an equivalent volume of PBS. surviving animals were euthanized 4 weeks after virus challenge. all animals were observed twice daily for weight loss and clinical signs. blood samples were collected 4 days after virus challenge. surviving animals were sacrificed 4 weeks after virus challenge. nonhuman primates were observed approximately every 4\u20138 hours when showing signs of disease. telemetry Real-time telemetry analysis was performed as detailed previous [32]. EDTA plasma was mixed with TriReagent LS (Sigma-Aldrich), 100 to 300 L. polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed as described previously. hematology K3EDTA tubes were inverted by hand and applied to the sampling port of an Advia 120 (Siemens Healthcare, Palvern, PA) the sample was centrifuged at 2500 rcf for 10 minutes and the plasma was removed from the cell pellet. the plasma was mixed with TriReagent LS (Sigma-Aldrich), 100 to 300 L, respectively. in vitro screening assays were used to identify antibodies that collectively provide properties such as blocking entry of EBOV GP-pseudotyped particles into susceptible cells. in vitro screening assays were used to identify antibodies that collectively provide properties such as blocking entry of EBOV GP-pseudotyped particles into susceptible cells. isogenic CHO cell banks were established that yielded several grams per liter of mAb in single use bioreactors. the purified proteins were available for in vitro testing approximately 2 months after immunization. recombinant, histidine-tagged Makona strain EBOV GP ectodomain protein (EBOV GP.10xhis) were available less than 1 year after initiation of the immunization campaign. each test antibody was captured onto the sensor chip surface via its Fc region, followed by injection of recombinant EBOV GP. the KD ranged from 3 to 8.4 nM, reflecting high-affinity binding for each of the 3 antibodies. REGN3470, RENG3471, and REGN3479 from EBOV GP at pH 7.4, pH 6.0, and pH 5.0 Antibody pH 7.4 pH 6.0 pH 5.0 k d (1/s) t 1/2 (min) k d (1/s) t 1/2 (min) k d (1/s) t 1/2 (min) k d (1/s) t 1/2 (min) k d (1/s) t 1/2 (min all possible paired combinations of EBOV-specific mAbs and an isotype control were tested. this assay format showed that REGN3470, REGN3471, and REGN3479 do not compete for binding to EBOV GP. REGN3470, REGN3471, and REGN3479 bind to separate epitopes on EBOV GP. real-time increases in resonance are shown after sequential addition of EBOV GP.10xhis, followed by REGN3479, REGN3470, and REGN3471. central panels show side views (parallel to the viral surface) and top views (perpendicular to the viral surface) maps were aligned onto EBOV GPTM from the c13C6:c4G7 reconstruction (EMDB 6152) the images were used to create the reconstructions are shown in Figure 1C. each antibody binds to a different site on the GP molecule. REGN3470 and REGN3479 neutralized pseudovirus particles with 0.27 and 0.17 nM. neutralization with REGN3471 never exceeded 90%. none of the antibodies blocked the entry of VSV-G-pseudotyped control particles. guinea pigs infected with 1000 plaque-forming units of EBOV given a single dose of REGN3470, REGN3471, REGN3479, or a control mAb at day 1 postinfection. studies have suggested that reduced fucose forms of nonneutralizing mAbs are more efficacious in animal models of EBOV infection than the same mAbs with normal levels of fucose. the ability of REGN3470, REGN3471, or a cocktail of the 3 antibodies to mediate FcRIIIa signaling was evaluated in the presence of HEK293 cells expressing Makona strain EBOV GP. group of 6 animals (approximately 400 grams each) were challenged with a target dose of 1000 pfu of guinea pig-adapted EBOV, followed 24 hours later by a single 5-mg dose of antibody or placebo control. all of the guinea pigs in the placebo group succumbed to EBOV disease by day 7. rhesus macaques were challenged with a target dose of 1000 pfu of the Kikwit strain of EBOV by intramuscular injection and were randomized into 2 groups. group 1 (control arm) contained 9 animals that were administered the REGN3470-3471-3479 cocktail intravenously at 50 mg/kg (1:1:1) on days 5, 8, and 11 postinfection. three doses of REGN3470-3471-3479 cocktail protect rhesus macaques from disease after infection with the Kikwit strain of EBOV. survival plots, (B) signs of clinical disease, and (C) viral load data for animals treated with placebo (6 animals) or with 3 doses of 50 mg/kg (1:1:1) of REGN3470-3471-3479 cocktail on days 5, 8, and 11 postinfection (9 animals) fewer doses (and less total administered antibody) or single administration of the antibody cocktail provide a similar therapeutic result to what was previously observed with 3 50 mg/kg doses of cocktail. combined clinical scores of placebo and antibody-treated animals indicated that all animals had advanced disease that was controlled by the treatment. the majority of these infected animals displayed no symptoms after approximately day 10 postinfection. rhesus macaques were challenged and divided into 5 groups that received placebo control (4 animals), 150 mg/kg (9 animals), 100 mg/kg (9 animals), 50 mg/kg (9 animals), and 10 mg/kg (9 animals) of the antibody cocktail (1:1:1) on day 5 postinfection. all 4 placebo control-treated animals succumbed to EBOV disease. rhesus macaques treated with placebo or a single dose of 10 mg/kg (9 animals), 50 mg/kg (9 animals), 100 mg/kg (9 animals) or 150 mg/kg (9 animals) of REGN3470-3471-3479 cocktail on day 5 postinfection. in vitro screening assays were used to identify antibodies that collectively provide properties. 3 mAbs (REGN3470, REGN3471, and REGN3479) were selected within 10 weeks of initiating our immunization campaign. the selected lead antibodies were stably expressed in EESYR CHO cell lines by recombination-mediated cassette exchange into the EESYR locus. recombination is monitored by the exchange of fluorescent protein genes in the chromosome and the in-coming targeting vector (US Patent 7771997). the KD ranged from 3 to 8.4 nM, reflecting high-affinity binding for each of the 3 antibodies. additional studies examined whether the antibodies retained binding over the normal range of endosomal pH (5\u20137.4) REGN3479 from EBOV GP at pH 7.4, pH 6.0, and pH 5.0 Antibody pH 7.4 pH 6.0 pH 5.0 k d (1/s) t 1/2 (min) k d (1/s) t 1/2 (min) k d (1/s) t 1/2 (min) k d (1/s) t 1/2 (min) k d (1/s) t 1/2 (min) k d (1/s) t all possible paired combinations of EBOV-specific mAbs and an isotype control were tested. this assay format showed that REGN3470, REGN3471, and REGN3479 do not compete for binding to EBOV GP simultaneously. REGN3470, REGN3471, and REGN3479 bind to separate epitopes on the EBOV glycoprotein (GP) real-time increases in resonance are shown after the sequential addition of EBOV GP.10xhis, followed by REGN3479, REGN3470, and REGN3471. antibody REGN3471 (Figure 1C, purple) has the steepest angle of approach on GP. the antibody binds nearly perpendicular to the viral surface. this placement allows the GP trimer to accommodate 3 REGN3471 Fabs. neutralization with REGN3471 never exceeded 90%. none of the antibodies blocked the entry of VSV-G-pseudotyped control particles, indicating that their activity is specific for EBOV GP. kat cells mixed with HEK293 target cells expressing EBOV Zaire 2014 GP in the presence of REGN3470, REGN3471, and REGN3479. survival and clinical scores of guinea pigs infected with 1000 plaque-forming units of EBOV given a single dose of REGN3470, REGN3471, and a control mAb at day 1 postinfection. the ability of REGN3470, REGN3471, REGN3479, or a cocktail of the 3 antibodies to mediate FcRIIIa signaling in engineered Jurkat cells was evaluated in the presence of HEK293 cells expressing Makona strain EBOV GP. in the presence of EBOV GP-expressing cells, REGN3470 and REGN3471 induced a dose-dependent activation of FcRIIIa signaling in effector cells with half group of 6 animals (approximately 400 grams each) were challenged with a target dose of 1000 pfu of guinea pig-adapted EBOV followed 24 hours later by a single 5-mg dose of antibody or placebo control. all of the guinea pigs in the placebo group succumbed to EBOV disease by day 7. postchallenge administration of each antibody was shown to delay EBOV disease symptom onset and prevent or delay death during the 3 postinfection doses of the REGN3470-3471-3479 cocktail administered 1:1:1 resulted in 100% protection from lethal disease. group 1 (control arm) contained 6 animals that were each administered an intravenous placebo control. all 6 placebo-treated animals succumbed to EBOV disease by day 9 postinfection. three doses of REGN3470-3471-3479 cocktail protect rhesus macaques from disease after infection with the Kikwit strain of EBOV. survival plots, (B) signs of clinical disease and (C) viral load data for animals treated with placebo (6 animals) or with 3 doses of 50 mg/kg (1:1:1) of REGN3470-3471-3479 cocktail on days 5, 8, and 11 postinfection (9 animals) combined clinical scores of placebo and antibody-treated animals indicated that all animals had advanced disease that was controlled by the treatment. the majority of these infected animals displayed no symptoms after approximately day 10 postinfection. virus load was measured in the sera of infected control and treated animals by 2 different assays. rhesus macaques were challenged and divided into 5 groups that received placebo control (4 animals), 150 mg/kg (9 animals), 100 mg/kg (9 animals), 50 mg/kg (9 animals), and 10 mg/kg (9 animals) of the antibody cocktail (1:1:1) on day 5 postinfection. a single dose of the cocktail afforded high-level, dose-dependent, postexposure protection against lethal EBOV disease. rhesus macaques treated with placebo or a single dose of 10 mg/kg (9 animals) or a single dose of 10 mg/kg (9 animals), 50 mg/kg (9 animals), 100 mg/kg (9 animals) or 150 mg/kg (9 animals) (1:1:1) of REGN3470-3471-3479 cocktail on day 5 postinfection. multiple classes of EBOV disease therapeutics have been described. 3 antibodies were purposely chosen to bind distinct epitopes in the GP to hinder development of viral resistance. an antibody with FcRIIIa signaling but no neutralizing activity (REGN3471) can delay or prevent death. REGN3471 appears to bind even closer to the center of the chalice than does mAb c13C6 (that forms part of the ZMapp cocktail) compared with mAb114, a neutralizing human mAb obtained from a long-term human survivor of EBOV disease [39], REGN3471 binds the EBOV GP parallel to the viral surface on the outside of the glycan cap. rhesus macaque model of disease was evaluated using a clinical (nonadapted) EBOV isolate that replicates many of the key pathophysiological aspects to EBOV infection in man. the antibody mixture used was the same lot of clinical-grade material that is undergoing human testing. the posts are not copyedited and are the sole responsibility of the authors. questions or comments should be addressed to the author."}
