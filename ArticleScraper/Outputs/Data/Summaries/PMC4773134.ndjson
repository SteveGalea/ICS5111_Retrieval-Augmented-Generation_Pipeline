{"summary": "haemophilus parasuis is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium belonging to the family Pasteurellaceae. it is the causative agent of Gl\u00e4sser\u2019s disease in swine, a condition characterized by a severe infection resulting in polyserositis, meningitis and arthritis. strains are capable of spreading to the lungs and systemic sites. a polysaccharide capsule involved in resistance to phagocytosis and complement-mediated killing has been reported. some strains have been shown to produce cytolethal distending toxins. virulence-associated trimeric autotransporters (VTAs) have also been found in Haemophilus. researchers have explored the use of OMV as vaccines against both human and animal pathogens. the aim of this study was to examine the protein content of OMV from both avirulent and virulent strains of H. parasuis and examine use as a potential vaccine. bacteria were scraped from multiple BHI plates and resuspended in PBS to a final OD600 of 0.42 (1.6 ml) for vaccine challenge studies, bacteria were scraped from multiple BHI plates. cultures were grown to early stationary phase in supplemented BHI (400 ml) in a 1-l flask with baffles. bacteria were mixed by pipetting and subjected to low speed centrifugation. supernatant was removed and 9 ml fresh PBS was used to re-suspend the bacterial pellet. pelleted OMV were re-suspended in 30 ml 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), subjected to an additional ultracentrifugation step (110,000 g, 1 h, 4\u00b0C) vesicles were then adjusted to 45% (v/v) OptiPrep (Axis-Shield) in a total of 2 ml. ations of OMV were determined using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce), according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. sonicate and lysate of H. parasuis Bacterial pellets collected during OMV purification were suspended in 50 ml 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA containing 1 tablet of Complete, EDTA-free protease bacterial suspensions were centrifuged (7,500 g, 15 min, 4\u00b0C) to remove intact bacterial cells and supernatant was collected as sonicate material. whole cell lysates of Nagasaki and D74 were generated by growth in liquid supplemented BHI media to OD600 of 0.5\u20130.6. 125 l of 10% formalin was added to 50 ml bacterial suspension. 100 l of the bacterial suspension was plated on supplemented Casman's agar. a vaccine consisting of 80% bacterial suspension and 20% adjuvant was used to vaccinate pigs. separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using an iBlot system (Invitrogen) and probed with porcine sera (1:500 dilution). mass spectrometry Purified OMV were analyzed using the MudPIT (multidimensional protein identification technology) method [48]. a normalized spectral abundance factor was used to quantify the relative amounts of individual proteins in each sample. a normalized spectral abundance factor was used to quantify the relative amounts of individual proteins in each sample. values were averaged between the same biological and experimental samples. non-stimulated cells were included for each biological sample as a control. purified OMV, whole cell sonicate or LPS were resuspended in room temperature supplemented media. RNA was isolated using a MagMax Express (Life Technologies) and cDNA was synthesized using a SuperScript VILO cDNA kit (Invitrogen) piglets farrowed from caesarean-derived, colostrum-deprived pigs bred and raised on site were vaccinated intramuscularly with 25 g (protein concentration) H. parasuis ELISA Nagasaki sonicate was diluted in coating buffer (0.1M Carbonate-bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6) to a final protein concentration of 0.1 g/ml per well of an Immulon-2 ELISA plate (Nunc), incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C, washed three times with PBS-Tween (0.05%), and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at room real-time PCR results were analyzed for significance using data from five total animals in two independent experiments. probability (P) values were calculated by one-way analysis of variance and Bonferroni\u2019s multiple-comparison post-test against the negative control value. paired t-test was used to calculate the significance between endpoint titers of pre and post vaccination sera from each experimental group. Bacteria streaked on agar plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C in the presence of 5% CO2 for 1 h prior to inoculation with bacteria. day cultures were grown to stationary phase, at 150 rpm, which took approximately 12 h. plate grown bacteria were mixed by pipetting and subjected to low speed centrifugation to pellet intact bacteria. supernatant was removed and 9 ml of fresh PBS was used to re-suspend the bacterial pellet. a 13.2 ml ultracentrifuge tube and lower concentration OptiPrep solutions were layered on top (2 ml 40%, 2 ml 35%, 2 ml 30%, 2 ml 25%, 1 ml 20% and 1 ml 15%) fractions were collected in 1 ml aliquots from the top of the gradient. bacterial suspensions were centrifuged (7,500 g, 15 min, 4\u00b0C) to remove intact bacterial cells. the supernatants were pooled and then ultracentrifuged (110,000 g, 1 h, 4\u00b0C) to pellet membranes. whole cell lysates of Nagasaki and D74 were generated by growth in liquid supplemented BHI media to OD600 of 0.5\u20130.6. one ml of culture was centrifuged to pellet bacteria and supernatant was discarded. lysates were aliquoted and stored at -20\u00b0C until SDS-PAGE analysis was performed. six, 8 week old piglets farrowed from caesarean-derived, colostrum-deprived pigs were vaccinated intramuscularly with 2 ml of the above vaccine preparation. serum was saved and stored at -80\u00b0C until used for Western Blots. protease accessibility assay Purified OMV were left untreated or treated with proteinase K (200 g/ml), SDS (0.02%), or proteinase K plus all MS/MS samples were analyzed using Sequest. sequest was set up to search a Nagasaki (26418 entries) or D74 (26352) database assuming the digestion enzyme trypsin. lungs were lavaged with 300 ml of PBS. cells were cultured in 150 15-mm petri dishes for 2 h at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. non-adherent cells were removed and adherent AMac harvested. the supernatant was removed from AMac previously seeded into 48-well plates. cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 for 18 h. a lactate dehydrogenase assay (LDH) was performed according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. piglets farrowed from caesarean-derived, colostrum-deprived pigs bred and raised on site were vaccinated intramuscularly with 25 g protein concentration. pigs were observed for clinical signs of systemic disease, including lameness, lethargy, or neurological signs. serum from each pig was diluted 1:250 in 1% bovine serum albumin. titrated 2-fold in duplicate, and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. gnotobiotic pig sera was used as a control. pigs were examined for clinical signs approximately every 4 hours except for an 8 hour overnight period. any pig showing signs of systemic disease, such as neurologic involvement, severe lameness, or depression, were humanely euthanized with an overdose of barbiturate. bacterial lawns were confluent within 48 h. we chose stationary phase liquid cultures (12 hours) using BHI media. we created a whole cell sonicate as a control condition. protein in the whole cell sonicate (for both strains) was observed primarily in the 25\u201330% range of the density gradient (Lanes 4\u20136, Fig 1C and 1F) for liquid isolated OMV, protein was detected throughout all of the density fractions (Fig 1A and 1D, Lanes 2\u20133 and 4\u20136). TEM analysis showed a reduced number of spherical structures. for the plate grown Nagasaki OMV gradient, fractions 3, 4 and 5 were recovered and used for further analysis. for the plate grown Nagasaki OMV gradient, fractions 2, 3 and 4 were recovered and used for further analysis. OMV-associated proteins probed with H. parasuis immune sera showed differences in profiles between purified OMV and sonicate. the differences in protein abundance and immunoreactive protein patterns suggest that OMV content is not solely due to spontaneous vesicle formation. protease accessibility assay tests ability of OMV structures to protect proteins against degradation by extracellular proteases. purified plate isolated OMV and sonicate were incubated with proteinase K (with or without SDS) the addition of SDS to vesicles had no effect on overall protein content. analysis of plate isolated OMV identified 240 proteins associated with OMV from D74 and 198 proteins associated with OMV from Nagasaki. analysis of the purified sonicate controls identified 416 proteins associated with strain D74 and 360 proteins associated with strain Nagasaki. e-binding protein A 59 0.0270 0.0162 0.0135 0.0124 P 96% [43, 72] HPSNAG_1298 HPSD74_1320 L-cystine-binding protein tcyA 28 0.0265 0.0239 0.0055 0.0125 P 98% [43] HPSNAG_0439 HPSD74_0534 D-galactose-binding periplasmic protein 35 0.0230 0.0076 0.0244 penicillin-binding protein activator LpoA 64 0.0076 0.0101 0.0200 0.0151 O 94% [43] HPSNAG_0211 HPSD74_0260 maltose-binding periplasmic protein 42 0.0059 0.0018 0.0224 0.0043 P 99% - HPSNAG_0140 HPSD74_0186 outer membrane protein P2 39 0.0054 0.0114 0.0132 0.0251 O 75% [43, 70, 71 the most abundant proteins in the Nagasaki sonicate control were predicted to localize to the cytoplasm (43%). of the proteins in OMV derived from strain D74, there were outer membrane autotransporters (HPSD74_0166 and HPD74_1658), lipoproteins (HPSD74_1347), a subtilase (HPSD74_1715) and hemagglutinin family proteins. cytolethal distending toxin protein B (HPSD74_0360) is increased 5\u201310 fold above the protein level found in Nagasaki OMV. additional abundant virulence-associated proteins in OMV derived from strain D74 and Nagasaki included aidA (HPSD74_0870), ompP1 (HPSD74_0351, HPSNAG_0004), ompP2 (HPSD74_0186, HPSNAG_0140 production of the chemokine IL-8 transcript was significantly decreased (p0.05) in comparison to live bacterial stimulation when AMac were stimulated with Nagasaki plate OMV. we measured the cytotoxicity of LPS and OMV using a LDH release assay and found that OMV were not significantly cytotoxic to AMac. all pigs survived up to 15 days post-intranasal challenge. 3 of the 4 non-vaccinated control pigs died within 3 days of challenge. Western blots of Nagasaki whole cell lysate (10ug) probed with non-vaccinated porcine sera (PBS, pre vaccination, post PBS vaccination), Nagasaki sonicate vaccinated porcine sera (Sonicate, pre vaccination, post sonicate, post vaccinated porcine sera) strains D74 and Nagasaki reached maximum OD600 values at approximately 2.1 and 1.3, with maximum CFU values of 2.5 109/ml (D74) and 9 109/ml (Nagasaki). bacterial lawns were confluent within 48 h and colonies appeared on BHI agar within 24 h. 380 ml 6.39 1011 3.4 mg 1.0 mg OMV pellets were further purified by flotation through a discontinuous iodixanol (OptiPrep) density gradient. a portion of each fraction was separated by SDS-PAGE and gels were stained to visualize protein content. protein in the whole cell sonicate was observed primarily in the 25\u201330% range of the density gradient. sonicate samples contain a mix of structures, including several large (> 200 nm), round spherical objects. TEM analysis showed a reduced number of spherical structures. for the liquid grown D74 and Nagasaki OMV, fractions 4, 5 and 6 were recovered and used for further analysis. OMV-associated proteins probed with H. parasuis immune sera showed differences in profiles between purified OMV and sonicate or lysate. the differences in protein abundance and immunoreactive protein patterns suggest that OMV content is not solely due to spontaneous vesicle formation by cell lysis. a protease accessibility assay tests the ability of OMV structures to protect proteins against degradation by extracellular proteases. the addition of SDS to vesicles had no effect on overall protein content. incubation with proteinase K alone showed degradation of some surface exposed proteins. g/ml proteinase K (PK) treated (lane 3 & 7), 0.02% SDS and proteinase K treated (lane 4 & 8) SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie Blue. arrowheads indicate proteins missing after PK treatment.

OMV produced by H. influenzae, Helicobacter, Klebsiella and Pseudomonas were shown to stimulate production of the cytokines TNF-, IL-1, IL-6 and IL-8. production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 by AMac was not significantly increased in comparison to live bacteria for any of the Nagasaki vesicles tested (liquid, plate or sonicate) pre-challenge sera from the single surviving control pig did not exhibit increased reactivity above that of the other control pigs. the surviving control pig was derived from a separate litter than the other vaccinated animals in this experiment. this suggests individual genetic background may be important in resistance to infection with H. parasuis. examination of OMV from additional strains of H. parasuis, as well as their effect on additional host cell types, will give more insight into the virulence factors used by this organism to cause disease in swine."}
