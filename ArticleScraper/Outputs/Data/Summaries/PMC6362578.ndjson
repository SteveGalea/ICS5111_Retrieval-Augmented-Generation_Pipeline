{"summary": "middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is endemic in dromedary camels in the Arabian Peninsula. patterns of zoonotic transmission have largely been approximated from primary human cases. this is similar to seasonal patterns that have been described for other respiratory diseases in temperate climates. low visibility would be positively associated with primary cases of MERS. however the opposite relationship was seen. this may reflect behavioural changes in different weather conditions."}
