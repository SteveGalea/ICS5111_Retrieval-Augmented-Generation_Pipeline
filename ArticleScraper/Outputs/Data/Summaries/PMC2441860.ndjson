{"summary": "as of 31 December 2003, 8,096 cases had been identified worldwide. as of 31 December 2003, 774 people had died with a mortality rate of 9.6%. the pathogenesis of SARS CoV remains poorly understood. the coding sequence of SL-CoV isolated from bats shows low level of similarity to those isolated from human (76%) or civets (78%) [18]\u2013[20], while the E and M proteins of SL-CoV have high sequence similarity (96% to 100%) to those from human or civets [19], [20]. the host range of coronaviruses was reported to correlate with the degree of S protein variations. SL-CoV isolated from bats can incorporate into VLPs formed by the E and M proteins of human SARS CoV. the bs gene was amplified by RT-PCR and cloned into pFastBac DUAL vector. the recombinant baculovirus vAcME was generated following transfection in sf21 cells. western blot and immunogold labeling were performed to detect the incorporation of BS protein in BVLPs. the presence of BS, M and E proteins was detected by using an anti-SARS CoV antibody. there were no bands in the negative control of preimmune rabit antiserum. 5 g purified BVLPs were analyzed using rabbit-derived anti-SARS-CoV antibody. an equivalent amount of purified human SARS CoV VLPs was run in parallel. preimmune rabbit antiserum was used as negative control. BVLPs induced phenotype changes in DCs. the heated BVLPs induced much lower levels of CD83, CD40, CD86 and CD80 expression. BVLPs induced phenotype changes in DCs. the secretions of IL-6, IL-10 and TNF- were 5\u201310 folds lower in heated BVLPs-treated DCs than those in BVLPs-treated DCs. this enhancement is likely due to non-specific stimulation by remaining denatured proteins in heated BVLPs. BVLPs induced secretion of cytokines in DCs. DCs were treated with 10 g/ml polymyxin B at room temperature for 1 h. IL-6, IL-10 and TNF- were analyzed using ELISA. if SARS CoV VLPs activate DCs, the difference in IL-6 and TNF- induction is highly likely. the cells were harvested at 16 h post-inoculation and the expression of CD40, CD86, CD83 and CD80 were analyzed by flow cytometry. the expression of CD40, CD86, CD83 and CD80 were analyzed by flow cytometry. Immature DCs (1104) were exposed to BVLPs (10 g/ml), Ac or PBS for 24 h and then co-cultured with CD4+T cells (1105) in 96-well plates in triplicate for another 72 h. the DCs/T mixtures were then collected for intracellular IFN- or IL-4 staining followed by flow cytometry analysis. ELISA was used to detect the level of S-specific IgG antibodies. ELISPOT assay was also used to assess the magnitudes of S-specific IFN- (Th1) and IL-4 (Th2) T-cell responses after the mice were vaccinated with pcDNA-S. the recombinant baculovirus vAcME was generated following transfection in sf21 cells. the recombinant baculovirus vAcME was previously described. the main variation between SL-CoV and SARS CoV of human or civet locates in the S protein [18]\u2013[20]. the BS protein of SL-CoV was successfully incorporated into VLPs formed by the E and M proteins of human SARS CoV. the antibody also recognized the human SARS CoV VLPs but not VLPs formed by E and M proteins in the absence of S protein. the EM grids were loaded with purified BVLPs, SARS CoV VLPs or VLPs without BS or S protein for 5 min. grids were incubated with antibody specific against BS2 protein for 1 h. the samples were stained with 2% PTA for 1 min, drained and examined under the EM. 106cells/ml were incubated with 10 g/ml of BVLPs, 10 g/ml of LPS, 10 g/ml of heated BVLPs, Ac (culture supernatant of sf21cells transfected with baculovirus expression vector pFastBac DUAL with gfp under the control of p10 promoter) cells were collected, washed, stained with indicated antibodies, and BVLPs induced secretion of cytokines in DCs. DCs were inoculated with BVLPs with or without polymyxin B pretreatment. BVLPs induced secretion of cytokines in DCs. ml of either SARS CoV VLPs or BVLPs was incubated with immature DCs. BVLPs showed a stronger ability to induce the secretion of IL-6 and TNF-. difference in IL-6 and TNF- induction is highly likely due to the variation between the two S proteins. IL-6, IL10 and TNF- were analyzed using ELISA. data are expressed as the meanSD of triplicate samples. we cloned s and bs gene into pcDNA3.1 to construct the recombinant plasmids pcDNA-S and pcDNA-BS. these two plasmids were then immunized in mice intramuscularly every two weeks. both IgG1 and IgG2a were induced in all the immunization regimens by ELISA. the number of INF- or IL-4 -secreting cells was assayed by ELISPOT using splenocytes harvested from mouse spleens 10 days after the final immunization. the results represent the averages of triplicate wells of 3 mice. SL-CoVs isolated from bats display greater genetic variations than SARS CoVs from humans or civets [19]. we wanted to investigate whether the S protein of SL-CoV can incorporate into viral like particles (VLPs) formed by the E and M proteins of human SARS CoV and the S protein of SL-CoV of bats. baculovirus derived-BVLPs can interact with human DCs to induce DC maturation and activation. both BVLPs and SARS CoV VLPs activated DCs and induced DC maturation by enhancing the expression of costimulatory molecules and the maturation marker CD83. in the current study, BVLPs induced much higher levels of IL-6 and TNF- than did SARS CoV VLPs. this model may be applicable in the development of vaccines and drugs against the virus. BVLPs had stronger ability to stimulate DCs by inducing the production of IL-6 and TNF- in our study. the higher level of IgG2a and the higher number of S protein-specific IFN- or IL-4-secreting cells in mice immunized with pcDNA-BS indicated that the S protein of bat SL CoV was more immunogenic. gfp gene was cloned under control of p10 promoter to generate pFBS. vAcME was generated by transfecting the BS plasmids into insect cells sf21 using Lipofectin (Invitrogen) the presence of BS proteins in the purified preparations was confirmed by western blot using rabbit-derived anti-SARS-CoV antibody. the cDNA of 667\u20131242 aa in S2 region was cloned into pMAL-c2x expression vector (NEB) the samples were stained with 2% phosphotungstic acid (PTA) for 1 min, then drained, and examined under the EM. PBMC was cultured in six-well plates (2106 cells/ml) for 2 hours. p10 promoter or heat-denatured BVLPs or LPS incubated with 10 g/ml polymyxin B. after different treatments of DCs at 37\u00b0C for 16 h, supernatants were removed and frozen at 70\u00b0C until cytokine detection. Immature DCs (1104) were exposed to BVLPs (10 g/ml), Ac or PBS for 24 h and washed thoroughly. Treated DCs were then co-cultured with CD4+T cells (1105) in 96-well plates (Costar) for another 72 h. horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, IgG1 or IgG2a (sigma) was used as the secondary antibody. Optical density (OD) was read at 490 nm (A490) gfp gene was cloned under control of p10 promoter to generate pFBS. vAcME was generated by transfecting the BS plasmids into insect cells sf21 using Lipofectin (Invitrogen) the presence of BS proteins in the purified preparations was confirmed by western blot using rabbit-derived anti-SARS-CoV antibody. the cDNA of 667\u20131242 aa in S2 region was cloned into pMAL-c2x expression vector (NEB) Immature DCs were generated from PBMC as previously described. PBMC in RPMI 1640 (Gibco Laboratories, Grand Island, NY) were cultured for 2 hours. half of the medium was replaced every two days. DCs were stained for specific cell-surface markers and analyzed by flow cytometry. cells were washed in cold PBS and cell surface staining was carried out using antibodies. a minimum of 10,000 events were collected and analyzed. BVLPs-exposed DCs were prepared from PBMC by positive selection using anti-CD4 antibody (BD PharMingen) the purity was consistently above 95%. Immature DCs (1104) were exposed to BVLPs (10 g/ml), Ac or PBS for 24 h. horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, IgG1 or IgG2a (sigma) was used as the secondary antibody. Optical density (OD) was read at 490 nm (A490)"}
