{"summary": "feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus in the subfamily Coronavirinae. it is closely related to transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) of pigs and canine coronavirus (CCV) there are no effective drugs specific for FIP. PLpro processes the N-terminal end of pp1a/pp1ab into nsp1, nsp2, and nsp3. PLpro cleaves polyproteins at 11 sites to release nsp4 to nsp16 (6). the 3-dimensional structure of FIPV Mpro is still unavailable, deterring rational drug design against FIP. the glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein, GST-FIPV Mpro, was purified by GST-glutathione affinity chromatography and cleaved with rhinovirus 3C protease. the inhibitor N3 was added to the purified protein with a molar ratio of 3:1 to 5:1. the kinetic parameters for Zn2+ inhibition were evaluated using equation 1 (24) the value of Ki was then calculated from plots of 1/ V max app versus [I]. IPV Mpro-Zn2+-N3 complex have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with the accession code 5EU8. the coding sequence for FIPV main protease has been described previously (18). the structure of TGEV Mpro was solved by molecular replacement. iterative model building and refinement were performed using PHENIX (22) to obtain the final model. activity of Mpro and inhibition of N3 were measured by continuous kinetic assays. kinetic parameters of V max app and K m app were determined by adding 1 M FIPV Mpro to 40 M substrate containing various concentrations of zinc ion (0 to 4 M) the value of Ki was then calculated from plots of 1/ V max app versus [I] crystals only grew with the presence of zinc acetate in the reservoir solution. zinc ion might act as a cofactor/inhibitor for FIPV Mpro. a fluorescence-labeled substrate, MCA-AVLQSGFR-Lys(Dnp)-Lys-NH2, was synthesized. the final model contains the full-length FIPV Mpro amino acid sequence (Ser1 to Val299), inhibitor N3, and a zinc ion. only one FIPV Mpro molecule can be found in the asymmetric unit. a zoomed view of the substrate-binding pocket is shown to the left. the substrate-binding pocket of the FIPV Mpro complex is colored in yellow. the key amino acids constituting the substrate-binding pockets of the complex are shown as sticks. the residues involved in substrate binding are identical between the two proteases. this implies that the overall substrate-binding pockets of FIPV and TGEV Mpros remain intact during evolution. a drug targeting the active site of either of the two proteases should be as effective for the other. the distance between His41 and the thiol group of Cys144 increased from 4 in apo Mpro to 8 in the Mpro-Zn2+ complex. a simulated annealing mFo-DFc omit map shows the residues and Zn2+ in gray at 1, and an anomalous difference Fourier map shows Zn2+ in magenta at 3. the inhibitor is located at the cleft between domains I and II of FIPV Mpro. the inhibitor is located at the cleft between domains I and II of FIPV Mpro, with a buried surface area of 679 2 (70% of its total surface area) Structural insight into the mutagenesis analysis of the FIPV Mpro active center. the substrate-binding pocket is colored in yellow. Residues His41, Cys144, Tyr160, and His162 are shown as red sticks. no apparent activity could be detected for H162A and H162L. this is because N2 of H162 is a critical component for the substrate-binding pocket. y160A and Y160T mutants are almost inactive. the complex crystals only grew with the presence of zinc acetate in the reservoir solution, suggesting that zinc ion might act as a cofactor/inhibitor for FIPV Mpro. a fluorescence-labeled substrate, MCA-AVLQSGFR-Lys(Dnp)-Lys-NH2, was synthesized to determine the kinetic parameters. the structure of the complex was solved by molecular replacement. the final model contains the full-length FIPV Mpro amino acid sequence (Ser1 to Val299), inhibitor N3, and a zinc ion. a zoomed view of the substrate-binding pocket is shown to the left. the substrate-binding pocket of the FIPV Mpro complex is colored in yellow. the key amino acids constituting the substrate-binding pockets of the complex are shown as sticks. only 7% (21 of 302) of the residues are not conserved between the TGEV and FIPV Mpros. the residues involved in substrate binding are identical between the two proteases. this implies that the overall substrate-binding pockets of FIPV and TGEV Mpro remain intact during evolution. the distance between his41 and his41 increased from 4 in apo Mpro to 8 in the Mpro-Zn2+ complex. a simulated annealing mFo-DFc omit map shows the residues and Zn2+ in gray at 1, and a simulated annealing 2mFo-DFc omit map shows N3 in red at 1, respectively. the inhibitor is located at the cleft between domains I and II of FIPV Mpro. a buried surface area of 679 2 (70% of its total surface area) the inhibitor is stabilized by a hydrogen bond network. the substrate-binding pocket is colored in yellow. Residues His41, Cys144, Tyr160, and His162 are shown as red sticks. a bona fide model of FIPV Mpro is needed to analyze the accumulated enzymatic data. n acceptor whereas Cys144 initiates a nucleophilic attack on the peptide bond. no obvious activity could be detected for H162A and H162L. this is because N2 of H162 is a critical component for the substrate-binding pocket. a Zn2+ ion has also been identified in the ternary structure of the Mpro-Zn2+-N3 complex. the ion blocks efficient transfer of the proton from the catalytic residue for nucleophilic attack. the ion blocks efficient transfer of the proton from the catalytic residue. the conserved residues that participate in coordinating the Zn2+ are labeled by arrows. the conserved residues that participate in coordinating the Zn2+ are labeled by arrows. this is consistent with a previous report that Zn2+ could inhibit SARS-CoV Mpro. zinc has been used to treat the common cold since 1984. but the effect of this treatment has been controversial for a long time. the rationale for zinc treatment can possibly be attributed to its antagonistic effect on the rhinovirus 3C protease."}
