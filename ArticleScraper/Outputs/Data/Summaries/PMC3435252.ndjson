{"summary": "interferon-induced transmembrane proteins are a family of small transmembrane proteins that mediate some antiviral activities of type I and II interferons [1], [2], [3]. IFITM-mediated restriction is specific to specific virus families. AV virions are internalized normally and traffic to acidified endocytic compartments despite IFITM expression. a recent report showed that endosomes in interferon-treated Ifitm knockout cells are inefficiently acidified. IFITM proteins localize to late endosomes/lysosomes. the human IFITM family is composed of four functional genes, IFITM1, 2, 3, and 5. the proteins expressed by these genes restrict influenza A virus (IAV), filovirus, flavivirus, and SARS coronavirus entry in vitro with varying efficiencies. a modest but insignificant difference was observed in the mean survival time of knockout mice receiving each challenge dose, with mice receiving 1000 PFU surviving 0.7 days longer. weight loss at days 3 and 5 was significantly increased in IfitmDel and heterozygous animals as compared to wild type controls. the relative abundance of IAV M2 transcript levels from total lung or spleen RNA, normalized to endogenous Gapdh transcript, is shown. splenic viral loads were 15.9-fold greater in knockout than wild type animals. splenic viral loads of wild type animals were barely above the detection threshold of the assay. splenic viral loads are higher in infected IfitmDel knockout mice. weight loss trends in this cohort of animals were similar to previous cohorts. splenic viral loads were similarly increased in spleens. ifitm3 expression alone was sufficient to restore IAV entry restriction to knockout fibroblasts. however, ifitm3 is most effective while Ifitm5, 6, and 7 posses comparatively little activity. ifitm3 is most effective, most human and murine Ifitm proteins restrict IAV to some extent when over-expressed. egfp/ (Ifitm3-specific knockout), Ifitm3egfp+/, and wild type mice were challenged with 500 PFU of intranasal PR8. no differences were observed in disease progression between IfitmDel and IfitmDel knockouts. oncostatin M (OSM) induced strong Ifitm3 expression and IL-6 was a potent inducer of Ifitm3 expression in 3T3 cells. gp130-mediated cytokines induce Ifitm3 expression. the responsiveness of 3T3 and RAW cells to OSM and IL-6 correlates with their expression of their receptor-binding antibodies. ifitm1, 2, and 6 promoters appear constitutively active, and in contrast to human orthologs, insensitive to interferon stimulation. bars show mean of triplicates SEM. ifitm1 and Ifitm2 transcript levels were not increased by interferons. the difference was not significant due to the high variance of these samples. ifitm3 localization is consistent with its role as an IAV restriction factor. the data in Figures 2 and 3 show that Ifitm3 is the most potent IAV restriction factor of the murine Ifitm proteins. expression was observed on the endothelium of blood vessels (arrowheads) the endothelial cells in (A) and (B) provide a reference for staining intensity between the two slides. upper airway epithelial cells constitutively express Ifitm3. ifitm3 is expressed by the target cells of influenza A virus. confocal micrographs show Ifitm3 (red), influenza A virus antigen (blue), nuclear chromatin (cyan) and either type II pneumocyte marker DC-LAMP (green), many of which are Ifitm3 positive (yellow) mice lacking entire Ifitm locus exhibit a nearly identical disease course to those lacking Ifitm3 alone. we also show that many tissues express basal levels of Ifitm3 proteins, and at least two gp130-family cytokines can induce its expression. -mediated cytokines may allow for modulation of its expression in a more targeted, less pleiotropic way. pharmacologic induction of human IFITM3 expression or emulation of IFITM3 activity could provide a broad-spectrum therapeutic approach to the treatment of a range of human pathogenic viruses. a survival analysis between wild type and knockout animals showed significant differences in survival time as did a comparison of wild type and heterozygous mice (p = 0.0011), wild type and heterozygous (p = 0.0366), heterozygous and knockout (p = 0.0012). at both time points, weight loss differences between any two genotypes were statistically significant (Mann Whitney U test). weight loss in wild type animals followed trends reported by other investigators. mice maintained body weight until day 4\u20135 post-infection. rapid clinical progression beginning on day 4\u20135 coincided with cellular immunity. we did not identify splenic lesions or any other lesions beyond those in the lungs, trachea, and nasal passages. we therefore speculate that increased splenic viral loads in knockout mice are a result of more robust infection in the lung and subsequent leakage of virus or viral debris into the periphery. wild type, IfitmDel, and Ifitm3-specific knockout mice were challenged with 500 PFU of intranasal PR8. Mortality and weight loss trends of IfitmDel and wild type animals were similar to those of p = 0.5380. a type III interferon (IFN2), the acute phase cytokine IL-6, and oncostatin M (OSM), a cytokine released from activated dendritic cells to upregulate Ifitm3 expression. the latter molecules belong to a diverse family of cytokines that signal through hetero- or multimeric receptors that activate the Jak/STAT pathway. interferons and gp130-mediated cytokines induce Ifitm3 expression. gp130-family cytokines induce Ifitm3 expression. gp130-family cytokines in cells expressing appropriate receptors. the Ifitm5 promoter alone is interferon responsive (4.4-fold induction with IFN2; 2.2-fold with IFN) bars show mean of triplicates SEM. murine Ifitm1 and 2 were unresponsive to both type I and type II interferons. cytokine-mediated upregulation of Ifitm1 and 3 transcripts by qRT-PCR. ifitm3 localization is consistent with its role as an IAV restriction factor. constitutive expression was observed in respiratory epithelial cells of the upper airways (Figure 4D, E, F), the visceral pleura (Figure 4G, H, I), and in leukocytes (Figure 4J, K, L), suggesting that Ifitm3 may provide protection against influenza prior to the interferon and acute-phase responses. ciliated respiratory epithelium shows intense labeling of the apical cytoplasm or plasma membrane rather than the punctate intracytoplasmic distribution typical of lysosomes. Ifitm3 is expressed by the target cells of influenza A virus. Ifitm3 is expressed on alveolar type II pneumocytes (arrows) marked by DC-LAMP (green), many of which are Ifitm3 positive (yellow) occasional infected cells including an infected Ifitm3 positive cell (magenta) are scattered throughout the parenchyma. gp130-mediated cytokines may allow for modulation of its expression in a more targeted, less pleiotropic way. pharmacologic induction of human IFITM3 expression could provide a broad-spectrum therapeutic approach to the treatment of a range of human pathogenic viruses. mice were inoculated intranasally with influenza A virus diluted in 50 l of phosphate-buffered saline divided evenly between both nostrils. animals were weighed once daily and euthanized upon loss of 20% of initial body weight or when deemed moribund based on clinical signs. tor.
