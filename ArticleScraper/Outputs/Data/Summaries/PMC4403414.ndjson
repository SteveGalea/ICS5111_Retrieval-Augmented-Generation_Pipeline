{"summary": "MHV is a model coronavirus that infects the livers and brains of laboratory mice, causing acute hepatitis, encephalitis, and chronic demyelinating disease. a single Q159L substitution within the amino-terminal receptor-binding domain of the S1 subunit was sufficient to abrogate hepatotropism but had little effect on CNS pathogenesis. replicase and other nonstructural proteins have also been identified as liver virulence factors. mutation within the nsp3 protein abolished enzymatic activity attenuated hepatitis compared to wild-type (wt) virus. ns2 is a 2\u2032,5\u2032-phosphodiesterase that cleaves 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylates, blocking the activation of RNase L. recombinant JHM.SD (RJHM/A) (13, 16) was based on the MHV-4 isolate of JHM (16) and previously recovered by RNA-targeted recombination. rA59 was derived from an existing infectious cDNA clone (17, 18) intracellular RNA was extracted from recombinant 17Cl-1 cells. cDNA was reverse transcribed using superScript II and random hexamer primers. cDNA was amplified by PCR with Expand Long TAQ polymerase. the cDNA clone was constructed using the JHM.SD fragments as a scaffold. the fragments were PCR amplified from intracellular RNA extracted from 17Cl-1 cells (15) and inserted into the JHM.SD plasmids in place of the corresponding fragments. the viral genome transcripts were combined with the N gene transcripts and electroporated into the BHK-MHVR with three pulses of 850 V at 25 F using a Gene Pulser II electroporator. when viral cytopathology was observed, the combined cells and supernatant were harvested. chimeric and mutant recombinant viruses will be referred to as rSD and rWU as rWU here. recombinant viral genomes with spike-exchanged spike genes were verified by nucleotide sequencing. recombinant viruses were infected with rSD and rSD.SWU (B) or rWU and rWU.SSD (D) mice were sacrificed on day 5 postinfection and the viral titer was determined. four-week-old mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (IsoFlo; Abbott Laboratories) and inoculated intrahepatically (i.h.) or intracranially (i.c.) with each virus at the indicated dose. livers and/or brains were harvested and homogenized and their virus titers determined by plaque assays on L2 cells as previously described. the mouse 17Cl-1 and L2 fibroblast cell lines and baby hamster kidney cells constitutively expressing MHV receptor CEACAM-1 (BHK-MHVR) were cultured as described previously (17, 19) primary bone marrow-derived macrophages were generated from the hind limbs of B6 or type I interferon receptor-deficient (IFNAR/) mice. all of the BsmBI restriction sites encoded within the genome were removed by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis. the restriction sites flanking each of the fragments, as well as the EcoRV site at the 5\u2032 end of fragment A and the PacI site at the 3\u2032 end of fragment G were introduced. all of the chimeric and mutant clones used for virus recovery were verified by nucleotide sequencing. the full-length genomic cDNAs were assembled and the recombinant viruses were recovered as previously described (17, 18) chimeric and mutant recombinant viruses were created to generate the chimeric JHM.SD expressing the spike gene of WU (rSD.SWU) the portion of the spike gene containing the spike gene was amplified from the JHM.WU G fragment and cloned into the AvrII and SphI sites of the JHM.SD G fragment. mice were sacrificed with 500 PFU/mouse of rSD and rSD.SWU (C) or rWU and rWU.SSD (E) on day 5 postinfection. the virus titers were determined by plaque assays on L2 cells. all mouse procedures were reviewed and approved by the university of Pennsylvania IACUC. the livers were isolated and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned. a two-tailed Student t test was performed to assess statistical significance for in vitro experiments. the seven fragments were digested from vectors and assembled into a full-length genomic cDNA. the fragments were cloned into bacterial vectors as described above. the cloned fragments are identical to the sequence of rSD. mice were sacrificed and the virus titers in the brain and liver determined. the dashed lines represent the limit of detection, and the error bars represent the standard error of the mean (SEM) the data are from one representative experiment of two. wild-type JHM.SD replicated to an approximately 10-fold-higher titer. rWU replicated in the liver to an even higher titer, approximately 107 PFU g1. replication of rWU and JHM.SD was below the level of detection. rSD.SWU replicated to a 10- to 100-fold-higher titer in L2 cells. rWU.SSD replicated to similar titers in the liver in B6 mice. spike is not a significant determinant of WU liver tropism. rSD.Gwu, rSD.Fwu, and rSD.FWUGWU replicated in the liver. replacement of both the F and G fragments restored replication to approximately 2.6 105 PFU g1 in the liver. chimeric rSD viruses expressed the F or/and G fragment of rWU. mice were infected i.h. (500 PFU/mouse) and sacrificed on day 5 postinfection. the viral titer in the liver was determined by the dashed line. the sequence differences in HE, ns2 and nsp15 in the JHM.SD genome did not significantly affect viral replication in the liver. rWU cells were infected with viruses with mutations in the G fragment (B) or F fragment (E) recombinant viruses containing single substitutions did not replicate significantly differently from rWU in vitro or in vivo. however, the double mutant rWU.MF155L,V224A showed impaired viral growth kinetics in L2 cells. rWU.nsp13A335V, encoding the nsp13 of JHM.SD, also contributed to efficient replication in vitro and in vivo. rWU.CSD and rWU.ASD showed growth kinetics similar to those of rWU in L2 cells. but rWU.ASD was significantly attenuated (approximately 100-fold) for replication in the liver. mutations corresponding to these differences were introduced into the rWU genome to generate rWU.nsp1K194R, rWU.nsp2L282V, r rWU.nsp1K194R replicated in the liver to a similar extent as rWU.ASD and rSD.FWUGWU (which contains fragments A through E from rSD) rSD.nsp1R194K replicated to a significantly higher titer in mouse liver. the same K194R substitution was introduced into the genome of recombinant A59 (rA59), another hepatotropic strain used frequently for MHV pathogenesis studies. the double mutant had a phenotype similar to that of the single mutant A59.nsp1K194R in terms of replication in either L2 cells or the liver. nsp1 protein antagonizes IFN- production during MHV infection. previous studies showed that the MHV nsp1 protein might be involved in antagonizing the type I IFN immune response. the replication of both mutants was restored in the absence of IFN signaling. rWU produced approximately 210 pg ml1 of IFN- in the culture supernatant. the effects of these mutations were less pronounced in the rWU background. not important for replication in the L2 cell line in vitro, was associated with lower IFN- production in BMM as well as higher liver titers. B6 BMM were infected (MOI = 2 PFU/cell [C and F] and 1 PFU/cell [G] with the indicated viruses. the seven fragments were digested from vectors and assembled into a full-length genomic cDNA. the seven fragments were digested from vectors and assembled into a full-length genomic cDNA. the cloned fragments are identical to the sequence of rSD. rWU replicated faster than JHM.SD and rSD and to a peak titer 100- to 1,000-fold higher at 36 h postinfection. previous studies showed that intracranial inoculation of weanling C57BL/6 (B6) mice with JHM.SD or rSD caused severe encephalitis. titer of rSD was 4.7 106 PFU g1 of brain, similar to that of wild-type JHM.SD. rWU replicated to an approximately 10-fold-higher titer in the liver. replication of rSD and rSD was below the level of detection. spike has a 141-amino-acid in-frame deletion (JHM.SD residues 454 to 594) within the S1 subunit hypervariable domain as well as a 1-amino-acid substitution, L48R, within the receptor-binding domain at the amino terminus of the S1 subunit. spike is not a significant determinant of WU liver tropism. e JHM.WU spike protein contains a 141-amino-acid deletion relative to JHM.SD spike. the 3\u2032 JHM.WU genome fragments F and G encode some of the nonstructural proteins and all of the structural proteins. replacement of both the F and G fragments restored replication to approximately 2.6 105 PFU g1 in the liver. chimeric rSD viruses expressing the F or/and G fragment of rWU were restored by replacement of F and/or G fragments with those of rWU. mice were infected i.h. (500 PFU/mouse) and sacrificed on day 5 postinfection. the viral titer in the liver was determined by the dashed line. rWU.HEI425M,L426F, rWU.ns2G177D/HES3R, and rWU.nsp15V41E exhibited growth kinetics in L2 cells that were similar to those of rWU (Fig. 5B and C) the sequence differences in HE, ns2 and nsp15 in the JHM.SD genome did not significantly affect viral replication in the liver. rWU.MF155L and rWU.MV224A did not replicate significantly differently from rWU in vitro or in vivo. the double mutant rWU.MF155L,V224A showed impaired viral growth kinetics in L2 cells. nsp1 does not affect replication in L2 cells in vitro but influences viral replication in the liver. rWU.CSD and rWU.ASD showed growth kinetics similar to those of rWU in L2 cells. but rWU.ASD was significantly attenuated (approximately 100-fold) for replication in the liver. mutations in nsp1 attenuates replication of rWU and rA59 in the liver. rWU.nsp1K194R replicated in the liver to similar extent as rWU.ASD and rSD.FWUGWU (which contains fragments A through E from rSD) mice were sacrificed and the viral titer in the liver was determined. sp1R194K replicated to a significantly higher titer in mouse liver. as the nsp1 residue K194 is conserved among all MHV strains except JHM.SD. the same substitution was introduced into the genome of recombinant A59 (rA59), another hepatotropic strain used frequently for MHV pathogenesis studies. strains from subgroup 2a through 2d were aligned using CLUSTAL 2.1. completely conserved residues are in black boxes, and partially conserved residues are in white boxes. previous studies showed that the MHV nsp1 protein might be involved in antagonizing the type I IFN immune response. the rA59.nsp1K194R and A59.nsp1R193S/K194E mutants replicated similarly. the replication of both mutants was restored in the absence of IFN signaling. nsp1 K194 residue found in rWU and rA59 was associated with lower IFN- production in BMM as well as higher liver titers. nsp1 antagonizes IFN- production in BMM derived from B6 (A and D) or IFNAR/ (B and E) mice were infected with each virus. replication to a high titer in the liver was multifactorial and mapped to amino acid substitutions in the membrane (M) structural protein and nonstructural replicase proteins (nsp1 and nsp13) replication to a high titer in the liver was multifactorial and mapped to amino acid substitutions in the membrane (M) structural protein. a chimeric rSD expressing the spike of hepatotropic MHV-A59 was not able to replicate in the liver. this suggests that attenuation of replication in vitro may not predict poor viral replication in vivo. rWU.MF155L,V224A replicated moderately less well than rWU in L2 cells. a study of MHV-A59 M protein glycosylation variants correlated replication in the liver with induction of type I interferon (46). we also identified amino acid differences between the JHM.SD and JHM.WU genomes within nonstructural proteins. nsp1 is the N-terminal cleavage product of the replicase polyprotein. the K194 residue of MHV nsp1 is conserved among all MHV isolates except JHM.SD and also throughout other betacoronaviruses. neither K194R nor the charge-disrupting R193S/K194E double substitution within JHM.WU had a detectable effect on replication in vivo. rWU.nsp1K194 was significantly attenuated for liver replication compared to rWU. there were no significant differences observed in replication of the two viruses in the brain. this is similar to an A59 ns2 PDE mutant, which replicates robustly in the brain while being highly attenuated for liver replication and hepatitis. basal levels of interferon-stimulated gene expression are much higher in the liver than in the brain, leading to a more robust host innate response in the liver than in the brain. the mechanism by which MHV nsp1 interferes with the type I IFN response is not yet understood."}
