{"summary": "a single convalescent-phase serum sample was collected from healthcare workers at least 28 days after their last exposure to the patient. a single convalescent-phase serum sample was collected from healthcare workers at least 28 days after their last exposure to the patient. exposures were categorized as either unprotected or protected, depending upon whether full protective equipment was used. analysis was performed with SAS version 8.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) six of the eight SARS-CoV\u2013positive patients visited or were hospitalized at these eight facilities. 85% of healthcare workers were identified as being at high risk for infection. the most common occupation was nursing staff (48%), and the most common work site was the medical ward (38%), followed by the emergency department (24%) (Table 2). Preexisting medical conditions in the healthcare workers were infrequent (data not shown). sixty-six healthcare workers (65%) reported that the patient was coughing during one or more patient-worker interactions. of these, 40% had at least one exposure without a respirator and 52% had at least one without gown, gloves, and eye protection. lapses in infection control still occurred, with nearly half reporting unprotected exposures, including many with no eye protection. lapses in infection control still occurred, with nearly half reporting unprotected exposures, including many with no eye protection. unprotected exposures may have resulted from absence of highly infectious patients or high-risk patient procedures. in one case-control study, use of any mask was associated with lower odds of infection in healthcare-related clusters. outbreaks among healthcare workers have occurred after exposure to certain patients. enrollment of both healthcare facilities and healthcare workers was incomplete. one institution in which healthcare workers were exposed to two SARS-CoV\u2013positive patients was not included. 85% of healthcare workers identified as being at high risk. current levels of adherence to infection-control practices in the united states may not be sufficient. unprotected exposures among healthcare workers may still occur despite implementation of facilitywide infection-control precautions."}
