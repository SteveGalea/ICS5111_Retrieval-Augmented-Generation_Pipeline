{"summary": "about 30% of infected individuals are capable of spontaneously clearing the virus, usually within the first 12 months of infection. about 20% develop liver cirrhosis and 1\u20133% hepatocellular carcinoma, one of the leading causes of cancer mortality [2, 3] sequences for regions in which secondary structure is known include nE1, -sandwich core, -sandwich core, and back layer. the front layer, -sandwich core, CD81 binding loop, and back layer are colored as depicted in panel (B) our understanding of the E2 protein has been enhanced by the recent crystallization of the E2 core domain (E2c) a number of antibodies targeting E1, E2, or the E1E2 complex have been isolated, some exhibiting cross-neutralizing behavior when tested against multiple viral genotypes. alanine scanning mutant library spanning the entirety of E1 and E2 has provided partial yet critical information on the architecture and functions of the glycoproteins [15, 16, 23\u201325]. the comprehensive alanine scanning mutagenesis, in combination with antibodies recognizing a wide range of discontinuous epitopes, can provide a snapshot of how the different regions in E1 and E2 may be brought together. 412\u2013423 L413, N415, G418, and W420 required for binding; potent, cross-reactive AP33 [25, 31, 32] Continuous 412\u2013423 Murine mAb; L413, N415, G418, and W420 required for binding; potent, cross-reactive AR1A/B [33] Discontinuous Non-neutralizing face of E2c Strain specific; no neutralizing activity; AR1A can block CD81 binding to 45 individual alanine mutations spanning nearly the entire E1E2 protein sequence of a genotype 1a isolate. the remaining ten mutations were introduced into an equivalent E1E2 expression vector (plasmid H77c, [27]) only mutant T329A resulted in markedly reduced V5 expression compared to the other mutants in the library. expression of the ten remaining mutants not present in the library was assessed using antibodies targeting continuous epitopes. mutations resulted in less than 50% binding to the panel of conformation-dependent antibodies (AR1-5) when analyzed by flow cytometry. the original mapping of mAb HCV1 resulted in the identification of a stretch of amino acids 412\u2013423 following hypervariable region 1 (HVR1) of E2 as the epitope. the mapping approach correctly identified the critical residues L413, N415, G418, and W420 for both HCV1 and AP33. mAbs AR1A and AR1B have previously been described as binding genotype-specific E2 but lack significant neutralizing capabilities. mAbs AR1A and AR1B have previously been described as binding genotype-specific E2 but lack significant neutralizing capabilities. mutations of the epitope residues shared between mAbs AR1A and AR1B did not alter binding of CD81-LEL. mutations of the three residues specific for AR1B resulted in decreased CD81 binding. mAbs AR1A, AR1B, AR4A and AR5A were excluded as controls. only K628A exhibited less than 25% AR2A binding and greater than 75% binding for control mAb. mAb AR2A binds the back layer of E2. mAbs AR3A, AR3B, AR3C, and AR3D target overlapping but distinct epitopes on E2 (Figs 6 and S2). the four mAbs share 13 common critical amino acids with approximately half of these residues localized on the front layer of E2 (amino acids 421\u2013452) mAbs target overlapping but distinct epitopes on the neutralizing face of E2c. mutated residues for which binding for mAb AR3A was 25%, but >75% for at least one control mAb. hydrogen bond calculations suggest interactions between several residues in the back layer region with the central Ig scaffold and front layer. however, only two mutations caused impaired global folding based on the same criteria as above. recent structural data revealed that the cell surface receptor CD81 binds to the front layer and the CD81 binding loop of E2c. Y613 and W616 are within close proximity to the front layer helix. mutation of either residue abolished CD81-LEL binding. residues in four distinct E2c regions were found to be important for CD81 binding. binding signals to mAb HCV1 were used as expression control for the mutants. soluble E2c harboring I622A, F627A, or double mutations to bind CD81-Fc and a mutant that reduces CD81 dimerization, i.e. CD81-Fc (K124T) was found to enhance binding by 56% and 49%. ine substitutions in the back layer (residues 600\u2013645) were generated. mutant viruses were found to be mostly poorly or non- infectious. expression of glycoproteins in transfected cell lysates was similar. mAb types to identify potential E1E2 interface residues based on the effects of mutations on antibody binding. residues that correlate with low binding by anti-E2 and anti-E1E2 (Class 1) are likely to be critical to the global integrity of the E1E2 heterodimer complex. the 34 identified Class 2 residues could be considered critical residues for binding by anti-E1E2 mAbs. mutation of residues that impact binding by one mAb should not affect binding by the other. mutation of residues that severely impact binding by one mAb should not affect binding by the other. E2 mutants lacking the stalk region did not bind to AR2A and AR3A mAbs suggesting that absence of stalk region can have a deleterious effect on overall E2 folding. six of the 8 cysteine residues that fall under Class 3 (low binding by anti-E2 only) are critical for structural integrity but not for E1E2 complex formation. remaining ten mutations were introduced into an equivalent E1E2 expression vector (plasmid H77c, [27]) only mutant T329A resulted in markedly reduced V5 expression compared to the other mutants in the library. mutations resulted in less than 50% binding (relative to wild-type) to mAbs targeting conformation-dependent antibodies (AR1-5). mutants were predominantly located in the central Ig-like sandwich or the back layer of E2. the original mapping of mAb HCV1 resulted in the identification of a stretch of amino acids 412\u2013423 following hypervariable region 1 (HVR1) of E2 as the epitope. the mapping approach used in this study correctly identified the critical residues L413, N415, G418, and W420 for both HCV1 and AP33. epitope mapping of antibodies to E2 antigenic regions (ARs) 1 to 3 Previous studies used a small panel of alanine mutants and ELISA to define epitopes for seven mAbs, AR1A-B, AR2A, and AR3A-D, targeting three distinct antigenic regions on E2. mutations of epitope residues shared between mAbs AR1A and AR1B did not alter binding of CD81-LEL, while mutations of the three residues specific for AR1B resulted in decreased CD81 binding. mutations of these residues to alanine disturbed the global folding of E1E2. only K628A exhibited less than 25% AR2A binding. mAb AR2A binds the back layer of E2. mAb AR2A binds the back layer of E2. mAbs AR3A, AR3B, AR3C, and AR3D target overlapping but distinct epitopes on E2. the four mAbs share 13 common critical amino acids with approximately half of these residues localized on the front layer of E2. the remaining critical residues are mostly spread throughout the Ig sandwich and CD81 binding loop. mutated residues for mAb AR3A were 25%, but >75% for at least one control mAb. mutations leading to 25% binding for all four AR3 mAbs were excluded. in ELISA analysis, only two mutations caused impaired global folding. recent structural data revealed that the cell surface receptor CD81 binds to the front layer and the CD81 binding loop of E2c (residues 519\u2013535) [15] Y613 and W616 are within close proximity to the front layer helix. mutation of either residue abolished CD81-LEL binding. residues in four distinct E2c regions were found to be important for CD81 binding. binding signals to mAb HCV1 were used as expression control for the mutants. soluble E2c harboring I622A, F627A, or double mutations to bind CD81-Fc and a mutant that reduces CD81 dimerization, i.e. CD81-Fc (K124T) mAbs that recognize discontinuous epitopes on E2 (anti-E2, i.e. AR1, AR2 and AR3) and mAbs that recognize discontinuous epitopes requiring both E1 and E2 (anti-E1E2, i.e. AR4 and AR5) were found to be mostly poorly or non- infectious. residues that correlate with low binding by anti-E2 and anti-E1E2 (Class 1) are likely to be critical to the global integrity of the E1E2 heterodimer complex. on average, Class 1 residues are 91% conserved and 6 are cysteines. the majority of Class 2 residue mutations affected binding of both mAbs in a similar manner regardless of their location on E1 or E2. these residues, outside the AR4A and AR5A binding epitopes, are important for formation of the E1E2 complex, either by influencing folding of E1 or by being part of the complex interface. class 2 residues on E1 includes 6 of the 8 cysteine residues that map to the nE1 region that has been crystallized and whose structure has been determined. eight such residues were mapped to either the -sandwich (5 residues) or the back layer of E2c (3 residue) a panel of 13 mAbs and CD81-LEL tested them against a complete alanine-scanning mutagenesis library of E1E2. the library was created by substituting alanine for every residue (and serine for alanine residues) of the H77 genotype 1a and E2 proteins followed by high-throughput flow cytometry analysis to measure antibody reactivity to each mutant. mutations at putative fusion peptide do not disrupt complex with E1E2. mutations in this region should affect E1E2. mutations in this region should affect E1E2. mutagenesis studies indicate that mutations within this region did not affect E1E2 association or binding to CD81 receptor. alanine mutations at the aforementioned 11 residues exhibit less than 25% CD81-LEL reactivity (S1 Table) the side chains of both residues point towards the front layer 1 helix and potentially hydrogen bond with the main chain of L441 and W437 respectively. these two residues may act as an anchor, stabilizing front layer folding and architecture of the CD81 binding site. changes in the back layer can affect E1E2 functions in different ways (e.g. protein folding and incorporation onto virions, receptor binding, and other steps for productive infection). mAb AR2A neutralizes only some strains of HCV [33, 58], but all HCV genotypes when HVR1 is deleted, suggesting that its target residues are conserved but likely shielded by HVR1. alanine substitution at T425, L427, N428, C429, G436 and L441 in the front layer region greatly reduced the binding of the four AR3-specific mAbs. alanine substitution at L433, L438, F442 and K446 had variable effects on the binding of AR3 mAbs. mutation of either specifically affects binding by AR3 antibodies and CD81-LEL, but not the other mAbs to discontinuous epitopes. mAbs AR4A and AR5A recognize overlapping but distinct epitopes targeting the front layer region and the CD81 binding loop of E2c. the same group also proposed that the E2 region spanning amino acids 581\u2013650 could be involved in a \u201ccrosstalk\u201d with E1. this region encompasses a flexible area and the back layer of E2c. results from AR4A and AR5A mapping support the hypothesis that some residues between E2 581\u2013650 are involved in interactions with E1. six of the 14 class 2 E1 residues are cysteines (C207, C226, C229, C238, C304 and C306), suggesting a role for disulfide bridges in E1 folding/stabilization and/or E1E2 complex formation. mutation of these cysteines did not affect the binding of other conformation-dependent mAbs. the importance of variable regions and E2 stalk in E1E2 assembly was confirmed independently using mutants that lacked these regions. the transmembrane regions of E1 and E2 are crucial for E1E2 dimerization and specific mutations within either domain can reduce up to 75% of heterodimer formation. the high level of conservation among many back layer residues confirms the critical role of this region. 36 of the 49 back layer residues are 90% conserved with 28 being >99% conserved. however, when tested by ELISA, only Y611A and R614A meet the criteria established for determining residues that impact overall protein folding. it remains to be determined if full-length E1 retains the above-described structure in complex with E2. several studies suggest that the putative fusion peptide is located between residue 265\u2013296 [48]. the hydrophobic region spanning residues 265\u2013296 is relatively conserved among genotypes. analysis of the E1E2 library confirms that alanine mutations at the aforementioned 11 residues exhibit less than 25% CD81-LEL reactivity. the back layer Y613 and W616 were identified as also crucial for CD81-LEL reactivity. the back layer can influence binding of CD81 and antibodies that target the front layer through indirect interactions. additional interactions between back layer and -sandwich residues were also observed, suggesting the back layer is highly involved in stabilizing the globular structure of E2. the E2 AR3, also known as the neutralizing face of E2, is devoid of N-linked glycans. it is formed by two E2 regions, the front layer (a.a. 421\u2013452) and the CD81 binding loop (a.a. 519\u2013535). the majority of the residues in the front layer and CD81 binding loop are highly conserved (>90% conservation) the less conserved L438 (43%), F442 (81%) and K446 (65%), and E431 and a set of 3 residues outside AR3 (V538, L546 and V563) have been reported to confer resistance to some AR3 mAbs. alanine substitution at L433, L438, F442 and K466 had the opposite effect on the binding of AR3 mAbs compared to naturally occurring mutations to isoleucine, his flow cytometry analysis revealed that only 4 exhibited 25% binding for AR4A or AR5A alone. previous studies have revealed minimal overlap between the AR4A and AR5A epitopes suggesting that the remaining 30 residues, that reduce binding by both AR4A and AR5A, are required. mutations within the variable regions of E2 were generally well tolerated. mutations in 9 residues, F465A, Q467A, I472A in VR2, G573A, C581A, D584A, C585A in VR3, F586A and Y594A in post-VR3, reduced binding of E1E2-specific mAbs AR4A and AR5A by at least 50% compared to wild-type E1E2. these cysteines did not affect the binding of other conformation-dependent mAbs. they could instead be unpaired and required for HCV infectivity. a glycan-free face of E2 distal from the front layer interacts with E1 forming the complex interface. CD81-LEL and a panel of mAbs targeting five antigenic regions of E1E2 against a comprehensive alanine mutant library. this approach offers a global perspective of folding and expression of the complex, and provides insight into E1E2 structure and antigenicity. complete alanine scanning mutagenesis data will be valuable to inform design of new E1E2 constructs with improved biochemical properties. a folded, soluble complex of E1E2 ectodomain will be highly valuable to the field. future research on E1E2 interface could lead to improved immunogen engineering for vaccine design. individual residues of E1 and E2 were mutated to alanine. existing alanine residues were mutated to serine to create a library of clones. 98.2% of the target residues were generated by Integral Molecular, Inc. mAbs targeting AR1 are strain-specific and mostly non- or weakly neutralizing, suggesting this region is occluded in native virions. mAbs targeting AR2 and AR3 are capable of neutralizing several viral genotypes. al Molecular, Inc. was transfected into HEK-293T cells. cells were washed in PBS supplemented with calcium and magnesium. permeabilized with 0.1% (wt/vol) saponin (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS supplemented with calcium and magnesium. reactivity against each mutant HCV E1E2 clone was calculated relative to wild-type E1E2 by subtracting the signal from mock-transfected controls. a titration curve for mAb binding to wild-type E1E2 was performed to determine the optimal mAb concentration (linear range) ELISA was used to assess binding capability of the mAbs to the mutants. cell lysate from transfected HEK-293T cells containing mutant antigen was captured on ELISA plates. dilutions of cell supernatants were repeated at least two times. supernatants from pAdvantage plasmid (without E2c) were also assessed for expression to bind mAb HCV1. the constructs were expressed in HEK-293T cells by co-transfection of expression plasmid with pAdvantage (Promega) and transfection agent polyethylenimine (PEI; Polysciences) as described above. transfected with H77 E1E2 (full length) was used as positive control. those transfected with pAdvantage plasmid alone (without E1E2) was used as negative control. plasmids of wildtype and mutant E1E2 were produced as described. cell lysates and culture supernatants were harvested 72 hours post-transfection. HCVpp was pelleted by centrifugation of culture supernatant at 16,000 rpm for 1 hour, resuspended, and purified over a 20% (wt/vol) sucrose cushion. alanine scanning mutagenesis was carried out on an HCV E1E2 expression construct. individual residues of E1 and E2 were mutated to alanine. existing alanine residues were mutated to serine to create a library of clones, each with a single point mutation. human mAb IGH526 target the N-terminal (residues 197\u2013207) and C-terminal portion (residues 313\u2013327, linear component of IGH526) of E1, respectively [23, 28, 29, 40] mAbs HCV1 and AP33 recognize E2 residues 412\u2013423, a region known for inducing potent, cross-reactive NAbs. the antigenicity of the two different forms of E1E2 antigens is mostly equivalent with some exceptions, predominantly in the E2 back layer. the antigenicity of cell lysate-derived E1E2 remains relatively stable over time, even after several freeze-thaw cycles. cells were washed three times with supplemented PBS and 0.1% saponin. re-suspended in cellstripper (Cellgro) plus 0.1% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) fluorescence was determined by fluorescence measurement of vector-transfected control cells. binding thresholds were established in which there was 25% binding of the mAb of interest but >75% binding of appropriate continuous and discontinuous control mAbs. mutants were individually mutated to alanine using the QuikChange Lightening Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) E2c constructs expressing WT E2c [15] or E2c with alanine mutations were transfected into HEK-293T cells in the presence of kifunensine. dilutions of cell supernatant containing soluble E2c were assessed for ability to bind WT CD81-Fc and CD81-Fc (K124T) the mutant reduced dimerization of CD81 [70] using ELISA. mAbs were probed by biotinylated mAbs A4, HCV1, AR2A, AR3A, AR4A and AR5A. binding was measured using HRP- Streptavidin (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) lsates from cells transfected with H77 E1E2 (full length) were used as positive control. non-transfected cell lysate was used as a negative control to determine background signal for each mAb. Binding studies for each mutant were repeated at least two times. mutants were transfected with pAdvantage plasmid. lentiviral reporter viruses pseudotyped with HCV E1E2 (HCVpp) were produced essentially as described [72, 73] but in 384-well plates. supernatants were harvested 48 to 72 hours post-transfection. diluted 1:1 with 16 g/ml Dextran/DMEM and stored at -80\u00b0C. h-7 cells were plated at 0.8 x 106 cells/well in DMEM containing additives and incubated at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 overnight. at 24 hours post-infection, 100 l of fresh media was added to each well. infected target cells were lysed 72 hours post-infection. the immunoblots were analyzed with the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System and Image Studio software (LI-COR Biosciences). the results were narrowed to 902 sequences that were analyzed for sequence variation (SNP) at the amino-acid level. each mAb was tested against each mutant in the library by flow cytometry using a fluorescent secondary mAb. background signal from mock-transfected cells was subtracted and the signals were normalized to the wild-type E1E2 positive control. full-length E1E2 without deletions (E1E2) and pAdv plasmid (Control) were used as positive and negative control. HCVpp was generated by transfecting 293T cells with plasmids expressing wild-type or back layer E1E2 mutant. reactivity of the mAb panel and CD81-LEL to E1E2 mutants is expressed as % wild-type binding level. results from previous mapping experiments by others and those from our study are included for comparison. Flow cytometry and ELISA analyses were performed as described in materials and methods. reactivity was determined for several back layer alanine mutants using either ELISA or flow cytometry. coloring corresponds to the level of binding: 25%, red; 26\u201350%, orange; 51\u201375%, green; 76\u2013150%, white; and >150%, blue."}
