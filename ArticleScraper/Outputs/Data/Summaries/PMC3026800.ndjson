{"summary": "a group of broad-spectrum medicinal drugs that target key viral functions are distinct from specific antiviral compounds that target key viral functions. they have already met the pharmacological criteria for medicinal drugs and are already approved for clinical use in some countries. the advantage of this group is that they have already met the pharmacological criteria for medicinal drugs and are already approved for clinical use. Ciliberto and coworkers demonstrated efficacy of Arb derivatives at inhibiting HCV entry and replication into hepatoma cells in the low micromolar range [13]. there is therefore an urgent need to develop efficient and well tolerated drugs to combat this virus. the peptides used were part of the sequence of structural or non structural (NS) proteins of HCV and of the bovine viral diarrheal virus. the amphiphilic helix of BVDV NS5A [15] and the transmembrane domain of HCV NS4A [16] were obtained as described previously. l stock solutions of Arb were diluted to a 1.88 mM final concentration in milliQ water. the final stock solution contained 10% ethanol. for SPR experiments, one mg of Arb was resuspended in water. supernatants were collected 48h post-transfection and filtered on 0.45 m. pseudoparticles were concentrated 100-fold after ultracentrifugation through a 20% sucrose cushion at 75,000g for 2h at 4\u00b0C. short, R18-labeled liposomes (1 l, 12.5 M final lipid concentration) were added to a 37\u00b0C-thermostated cuvette containing pseudoparticles in PBS pH 7.4 or 5.0. the same procedure was used to follow pseudoparticle fusion in the presence of Arb. spectra were obtained in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of Arb (0 to 100 M) samples were incubated 2 min at 37\u00b0C prior to recording. spectra were collected in the 300\u2013400 nm region. surface plasmon resonance (SPR) interaction of Arb with DMPC layers was investigated. the sensor chip surface was washed with a mixture of 50 mM NaOH and isopropanol (64, vv), at a flow rate of 20 l/min for 1 min. the running buffer was milliQ water. KD values were calculated from equilibrium resonance signal (Req) as a function of the analyte concentration. apparent KD were then calculated by nonlinear fitting to the expression Req = RmaxC/(KD+C), where Rmax is the maximum binding capacity of the surface. spectroscopy 1H NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker DMX 400 spectrometer operating at a proton frequency of 400 MHz. spectra were recorded with a 5 mm Triple Resonance Inverse TXI probe equipped with z-gradient. the /2 pulse was 10.3 s, the recycle delay was 3 s and solvent suppression with presaturation was used. 1D 1H spectra were measured acquiring 120 scans. each measurement was repeated 3 times, adding 240 scans with a delay time between scans of 15 s. the 1H frequency scale is given in terms of chemical shift relative to the acetone signal used as an external reference. ethanol stock solutions of Arb were diluted to a 1.88 mM final concentration in milliQ water. for SPR experiments, one mg of Arb was resuspended in water. for genotypes 5a and 6a, pseudoparticles were concentrated 100-fold after ultracentrifugation through a 20% sucrose cushion at 75,000g for 2h at 4\u00b0C. the following day, cells were seeded at 4000 cells/well in 96-well plates. particles and PCcholR18 liposomes were monitored by fluorescent spectroscopy. fusion was initiated by acidification to pH 5 with HCl. the same procedure was used to follow pseudoparticle fusion in the presence of Arb. spectra were obtained in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of Arb (0 to 100 M) samples were incubated 2 min at 37\u00b0C prior to recording. spectra were collected in the 300\u2013400 nm region (with 2 nm-increments), with blanks substracted. DMPC liposomes were resuspended in milliQ water and captured on sensor chip at 2 l/min for 5 min. the flow rate was increased to 30 l/min and the liposome surface was then washed with 10 mM NaOH for 1 min. an alternative electrical field was applied at room temperature for 3 hours. the sensor surface was regenerated to the original matrix by injecting 50 mM NaOH/isopropanol (64, vv) the sensor surface was then coated with a fresh liposome suspension for the next binding cycle. KD values were calculated from the equilibrium resonance signal (Req) as a function of the analyte concentration. free Arb was found to be lower that 0.2%. all experiments were performed with freshly prepared samples. spectroscopy 1H NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker DMX 400 spectrometer operating at a proton frequency. each measurement was repeated 3 times, adding 240 scans with a delay time between scans of 15 s. the 1H frequency scale is given in terms of chemical shift relative to the acetone signal used as an external reference (2.218 ppm). mixing between HCVpp and liposomes was only observed at low pH and optimal at pH 5.0 [18] in the presence of increasing Arb concentrations, lipid mixing was inhibited in an Arb dose-dependent manner. the effect of 11.3 M Arb on HCVpp-mediated membrane fusion was similar for all tested genotypes. values of the last 30 s of fusion kinetics (final extent of fusion) were used to calculate the percentage of fusion in the presence of Arb relative to fusion kinetics without Arb (100%). results are the mean +/ SEM of 4 separate experiments. at higher ratios, membrane inhomogeneities and invaginations appeared. a major overall membrane reorganization was observed at a 201 Arb-to-lipid ratio. only very high concentrations of Arb with respect to lipids could significantly perturb the lipid organization of these bilayers. surface plasmon resonance (SPR, Biacore\u00ae technology) used a sensor chip to capture DMPC liposomes. we first tested whether arbidol per se could bind or not to the chip. about 50% of Arb remained bound to DMPC. this demonstrates that Arb is capable of interacting with lipid membranes. but binding curves could not be fitted properly with the different models. 2, 4, 6, 8 and 11.3 M were injected over immobilized DMPC membranes for 4 min at a flow rate of 20 l/min, followed by water. a representative set of data of non-linear regression fits to the equilibrium resonance signal (Req), obtained by extrapolation to infinite time (see Materials and Methods), vs Arb concentration. spectral crowding due to the presence of phospholipid resonances allowed only the observation of protons denoted 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the arbidol molecule. additional 1H resonances could be resolved from 2D 1H NOESY spectra and 1H/13C HSQC spectra. a titration of Arb with Gd(DTPA-BMA) was performed at increasing concentrations of the paramagnetic agent, from 2.0 to 9.7 mM. protons 7 and 8 can be resolved only in the 1H/13C HSQC spectrum. protons 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the phospholipids were measured. the plot shows the relaxation times as a function of the Gd(DTPA-BMA) concentration. this titration leads to a curve for each proton whose slope corresponds to the PRE values. methyl protons 6 of Arb are at the lipid/water interface as the gamma-proton of the hydrophilic head-group of the lipids. the aromatic protons 2 and 3 are the most buried protons of Arb, close to the beginning of the hydrophobic chain (protons C2). the validity of assumption (ii) is supported by the NOE cross-peaks detected between proton 1 of Arb and the glycerol moiety of phospholipids fusion inhibition was ca. 50% when Arb was pre-incubated with either HCVpp or liposomes before fusion was initiated by lowering the pH. in contrast, only ca. 10% fusion inhibition was observed when Arb was pre-incubated with either HCVpp or liposomes. the effect of increasing concentrations of Arb on fluorescence of N-acetyl tryptophanamide (NATA) as a water-soluble Trp derivative, and tryptophan octyl-ester (TOE) as a membranotropic molecule. the fluorescence of NATA and TOE was recorded between 300 and 400 nm, using an excitation wavelength of 286 nm. a tryptophan derivatives and media pH 7.4 pH 5.0 NATA in solution 6410 5510 TOE in lyso-PC micellesb 589 484 TOE in PCchol liposomesc 6.00.5 9.20.2 TOE in PCchol liposomesc 11.71.4 15.61.3. c TOE-to-lipid molar ratio was 120. in affinity was observed (Table 3, compare TOE/micelles and TOE/liposomes) these KD values are comparable to Arb IC50 inhibition of HCVpp fusion. this further confirms that Arb interacts with indole rings, but with a higher affinity when indole is incorporated into lipid membranes. a red shift of the spectral maximum, proportional to Arb concentration, accompanied the fluorescence quenching. this effect was more pronounced at acidic pH (6 nm at pH 7.4 for 5 M Arb, and 12 nm at pH 5.0 for 100 M Arb) 5 M final, lipid-to-peptide ratio 201) were equilibrated to 37\u00b0C in PBS at pH 7.4 or 5.0, in the absence of increasing concentrations of Arb (2, 5, 10, 25 and 100 M) the apparent affinity of Arb toward Trp was calculated from the plot of the difference A between areas under the curve (AUC) of peptide without or with Arb. c KD values were calculated as described in legend to Figure 7. since Arb is an inhibitor of HCV membrane fusion, we reasoned that it might interact with the regions of E1 and E2 described as important for HCV fusion [11], [17]. this suggests that the interaction between the E2 peptide and the membrane would be weak at acidic pH, and that most of the peptide could be in solution. a histidine residue located in the immediate vicinity of Trp in the sequence of both peptides is expected to be charged at pH 5.0. b Peptide-to-lipid molar ratio was 120. c KD values were calculated as described in legend to Figure 7. differential arbidol inhibition of cell entry and membrane fusion of various HCVpp genotypes. the effect of 11.3 M Arb on HCVpp-mediated membrane fusion was similar for all tested genotypes, with about 50% inhibition of membrane fusion activity. this indicates that membrane fusion inhibition by Arb is not genotype-dependent. results are the mean +/ SEM of 4 separate experiments. Happ and mutant HCVpp W529A were taken as controls. inations appeared (Fig. 3F, asterisks in Fig. 3D) and a major overall membrane reorganization was observed at a 201 Arb-to-lipid ratio (Fig. 3G) this indicates that only very high concentrations of Arb with respect to lipids could significantly perturb the lipid organization of these bilayers. this also indicates that the direct interaction of Arb to lipid bilayers at the concentrations used to inhibit HCVpp infectivity and membrane we first tested whether arbidol per se could bind or not to the chip. a further 600 RU was seen when Arb was pulsed onto the chip. the binding of arbidol alone on the chip remains negligible. binding curves could not be fitted properly with the different models included in the BIAevalution 3.0 software. the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant KD was calculated from the equilibrium resonance signal (Req) as a function of analyte concentration. however, the direct use of Scatchard analysis to calculate the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant was not allowed. inset, representative set of data of non-linear regression fits to the equilibrium resonance signal (Req), obtained by extrapolation to infinite time (see Materials and Methods), vs Arb concentration, used to obtain apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) and the maximum binding capacities (Rmax) Kinetics were reproduced 4 times. additional 1H resonances could be resolved from 2D 1H NOESY spectra and 1H/13C HSQC spectra. additional 1H resonances could be resolved from 2D 1H NOESY spectra and the assignment of the proton lines for Arb in water. protons 7 and 8 can be resolved only in the 1H/13C HSQC spectrum. we measured the proton T1 relaxation times of both Arb and phospholipid protons to probe the immersion depth of Arb in the membrane. PRE measured on the Arb-bicelle system range from 0.90 sec1 to 0.03 sec1 for the phospholipid protons and from 0.90 sec1 to 0.20 sec1 for Arb protons. the PRE observed for each spin can be described as an overall relaxation enhancement [35] due to all the paramagnetic agents in solution. the aromatic protons 2 and 3 are the most buried protons of Arb, close to the beginning of the hydrophobic chain (protons C2). the validity of assumption (ii) is supported by the NOE cross-peaks detected between proton 1 of Arb and the glycerol moiety of phospholipids. the maximum PRE measured for Arb (protons 6) and phospholipids ( protons) are about the same, suggesting that the corresponding molecule regions are the most exposed to b was pre-incubated with either HCVpp or liposomes. the greater inhibitory effect of Arb when it has simultaneously access to both viral and target membranes suggests that Arb could also act by interacting with selective residues of the HCV glycoprotein sequences. the fluorescence of NATA and TOE was recorded between 300 and 400 nm, using an excitation wavelength of 286 nm, which corresponds to an absorption minimum of Arb [12]. the apparent affinity of Arb for indole of Trp derivatives was calculated as the difference (A) between spectral areas (AUC) in the absence and presence of Arb. ATA in solution 6410 5510 TOE in lyso-PC micellesb 589 484 TOE in PC liposomesc 6.00.5 9.20.2 TOE in PCchol liposomesc 11.71.4 15.61.3 a For experimental details, see legend to Figure 6. c TOE-to-lipid molar ratio was 120. indole fluorescence decreased when Arb concentration increased. this confirms that Arb interacts with indole rings, but with a higher affinity when indole is incorporated into lipid membranes. at acidic pH, Arb is most likely protonated in the lipid environment. a red shift of the spectral maximum, proportional to Arb concentration, accompanied the fluorescence quenching. this effect was more pronounced at acidic pH (6 nm at pH 7.4 for 5 M Arb, and 12 nm at pH 5.0 for 100 M Arb) the measure of the apparent affinity of Arb for these peptides inserted into PCchol liposomes was performed as described above. the apparent affinity of Arb toward Trp was calculated from the plot of the difference A between areas under the curve (AUC) of peptide without or with Arb (A = AUCno Arbwith Arb) as a function of Arb concentration (see inset for a range of Arb concentrations between 0 and 30 M) these peptides were described as membranotropic on model membranes [37] and contain aromatic residues. we therefore analyzed the effect of increasing concentrations of Arb on the fluorescence quenching of two peptide sequences derived from HCV E2. we also tested a third peptide located at position 270\u2013283 of E1, containing only one Tyr. the peptide could be released from the membrane at acidic pH. this behavior in not favor with their direct role as fusion peptides of HCV. this behavior in not favor with their direct role as fusion peptides of HCV. arbidol (Arb) inhibits virus cell entry and membrane fusion using HCVpp as a model of an enveloped virus. we showed that Arb displayed a dual binding capacity, on lipid membranes interface on one hand and on the aromatic residue tryptophan of proteins on the other hand. it therefore appears plausible that the observed inhibitory effect of Arb may result from a combined effect of binding of Arb on membranes and on (fusion) proteins. at low pH, the optimal pH for HCV fusion, these interactions would be favored due to the protonation of the amino groups. the protonation of the carbon bearing the ester group of Arb could displace this group out of the indole plane, and place it in a better position to bond with neighboring molecules. this could lead to a better membrane association. Trp is a component of proteins with interfacial properties [41], [42], often located at the lipid/water interface and grouped into so-called tryptophan-rich motifs crucial to protein/membrane association [52] Trp is also enriched at protein/protein binding interfaces of the small envelope protein of the hepatitis B virus [55], [53], [54] fusion occurs over a broad spectrum of pH's ranging from 6.3 to 5.0 [11], [18], [65]. fusion occurs over a broad spectrum of pH's ranging from 6.3 to 5.0 [11], [18], [65]. fusion occurs over a broad spectrum of pH's ranging from 6.3 to 5.0. Arb inhibition of HCVpp fusion was maximal when both viral and target membranes were incubated with Arb before fusion was initiated. this suggests that a certain level of membrane impregnation and/or saturation with Arb must be achieved to efficiently inhibit viral infection. this could explain why Arb exerts a relevant antiviral activity without noticeable membrane damages. the key point is the relative accessibility of these residues to Arb at the membrane interface. the presence of residues such as histidines (His) in their vicinity could modify their accessibility with respect to pH. low pH, Arb is also protonated, and this protonated form could exhibit a greater preference for the interfacial region of the lipid bilayer than the deprotonated form. this would explain the higher efficiency of Arb at inhibiting fusion at acidic pH. the lipid mixing kinetic was followed by fluorescence spectroscopy. fluorescent liposomes (12.5 M final lipid concentration) were added to 40 l of HCVpp in PBS pH 7.4 at 37\u00b0C. the apparent affinity of Arb toward Trp was calculated from the plot of the difference A between areas under the curve (AUC) of peptide without Arb (A = AUCno ArbAUCwith Arb) as a function of Arb concentration (insert)."}
