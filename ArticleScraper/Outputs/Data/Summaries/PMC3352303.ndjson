{"summary": "combined budesonide/formoterol (Symbicort\u00ae, AstraZeneca) is effective as both a maintenance and reliever anti-asthmatic medication. initial objective parameters measured include the oxygen saturation, peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) and respiratory rate. all patients reported improvement in the VAS (average 2.45 cm vs. 2.20 cm) none reported \"no change\" or getting worse. no statistical difference between using Symbicort\u00ae vs. nebulized salbutamol as reliever. formoterol is a long-acting 2-agonist (LABA) that has a rapid onset bronchodilatory effect within 1-3 min of inhalation. formoterol is a full agonist to beta-2 receptors compared to salbutamol that acts as a partial beta-2 agonist. formoterol has been shown to produce greater lung improvements than salbutamol. mbicort\u00ae as maintenance and reliever therapy (SMART) approach means using Symbicort\u00ae as a maintenance therapy twice daily with additional puffs of the combination inhaler as needed for symptom relief [9,11]. Methods In this randomized, open-label study conducted from March until August 2011, we compared the effects of Symbicort\u00ae (at the strength of 160/4.5 mcg per inhalation) VAS is a widely used measurement scale for many symptoms including pain and breathlessness at a specific point in time. we recorded two readings (pre- and post-intervention) on a 10-cm scale with the spectrum of completely asymptomatic on one end and the most severe asthmatic symptoms on the other end. -tests were used for parametric data, and signed rank test and Mann-Whitney test were used for nonparametric dependent and independent data. none of the patients required admission, and none required additional doses of relievers. nebulized salbutamol and respiratory rate are non-parametric data in both arms. the values for both pre- and post-interventions are mean and standard deviation values. all patients reported improvement in the VAS with the mean VAS of 2.45 cm and 2.20 cm in the Symbicort\u00ae and nebulized salbutamol arms, respectively. none of the patients in either arm reported feeling \"no change,\" \"a little worse\" or \"much worse\" after interventions. this study is an open-label, non-blinded trial involving a small sample size of 32 patients. the patient's comorbidities, duration of asthma and risk factors such as smoking status were not taken into consideration. this study may pave the way for larger studies in the future to study the beneficial effects of Symbicort\u00ae beyond the first 15 min. authors received dummy turbuhaler devices from AstraZeneca (Malaysia) solely for patient education. no other support was received from AstraZeneca (Malaysia)"}
