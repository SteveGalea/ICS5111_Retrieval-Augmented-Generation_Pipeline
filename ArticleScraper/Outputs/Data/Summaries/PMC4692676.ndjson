{"summary": "many viral pathogens remain without a protective vaccine including dengue virus (DENV), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)1-5. there is always a potential risk of generating drug-resistant infections with currently used antivirals. analogue Acyclovir inhibits herpesvirus DNA polymerase. protease inhibitors Boceprevir and Telaprevir block the release of influenza virus particles from infected cells. there are however very few licensed viral entry inhibitors including Enfuvirtide, which targets HIV gp41 to prevent fusion. the use of reporter viruses or cell systems could facilitate these studies and permit a high-throughput analysis. we previously used the cell-based approach and dissected the early entry of various enveloped viruses for the examination of antiviral compounds. for HCV, grow the Huh-7.5 cells in a modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 200 U/ml penicillin G, 200 g/ml streptomycin, and 0.5 g/ml amphotericin B. prepare the test compounds and controls using their respective solvents. incubate the plates at 37 \u00b0C for another 3 hr to allow XTT formazan production. determine the absorbance with a microplate reader at a test wavelength of 492 nm and a reference wavelength of 690 nm. calculate the percentage of surviving cells using the following formula. seed Huh-7.5 cells in a 96-well plate (1 104 cells per well) and incubate at 37 \u00b0C in a 5% CO2 incubator O/N to obtain a monolayer. add 100 l of a 100 M CHLA working dilution; this yields CHLA treatment at a final concentration of 50 M. remove the diluted inocula and gently wash the wells with 200 l of PBS twice. incubate at 37 \u00b0C for 72 hr to allow viral adsorption. remove the supernatant and gently wash the cell monolayers with 200 l of ice-cold PBS twice. perform the washes gently to avoid lifting the cells. treat the wells with the test compounds or controls. aspirate the drug-containing supernatant and remove non-internalized extracellular viruses by either washing with 200 l of citrate buffer (50 mM sodium citrate, 4 mM potassium chloride, pH 3.0) or PBS. incubate at 37 \u00b0C for 3 hr. compound treatments are less than 1% in the experiments; 1% DMSO is included as a negative control treatment. determine the cytotoxicity of the test compounds (e.g., CHLA and PUG) on the cells for the viral infection. the readout of viral infection depends on the virus system used. the method for detecting reporter-tagged viruses is described below. the ineffective concentration of CHLA and PUG against HCV is at 1 M31. this requires a 50-fold dilution of the virus-drug mixture. the dilution is dependent on the antiviral dose response of the test compounds against the particular viral infection. seed Huh-7.5 cells in a 96-well plate (1 104 cells per well) and incubate at 37 \u00b0C in a 5% CO2 incubator O/N. pre-chill the cells with HCV inoculum (MOI = 0.01) and test compounds or controls at 4 \u00b0C for 3 hr. higher concentrations of the virus can also be tested by increasing the MOI/PFU. infect the cells with HCV (MOI = 0.01) at 4 \u00b0C for 3 hr. use a 100 l virus inoculum containing 1 x 102 FFU. the 'viral inactivation assay' was performed to examine whether two specific natural compounds CHLA and PUG could inactivate the different enveloped viruses in cell-free state and prevent subsequent infection. both compounds achieved a near 100% inhibition against HCMV, HCV, and DENV-2, whereas a 60 \u2013 80% block was observed against MV and RSV. the control treatment heparin, which is known to block entry of many viruses, also inhibited attachment of HCMV, DENV-2, RSV, ad MV, but was less efficient against HCV. both CHLA and PUG were observed to effectively impair the viral entry/fusion step of the viruses examined (Figure 2B \u2013 F) analysis for (B) HCMV, (C) HCV, (D) DENV-2, (E) MV, and (F) RSV are indicated in each additional panel. results are plotted against the DMSO negative control treatment for virus infection. results for (B) HCMV, (C) HCV, (D) DENV-2, (E) MV, and (F) RSV are indicated in each additional panel. data are plotted against the DMSO negative control treatment of virus infection. the utility and applicability of such methods have been demonstrated in many antiviral studies26,30,31,40,41. heparin is included as a control for all three assays in the context of the representative results. additional controls could be used, such as neutralizing antibodies directed against the virus. viral entry-specific assays described in this report allow examination of the drug effect on the distinct viral entry stage at the cellular level. the results obtained from such assays would therefore help better predict the antiviral efficacy of the test compounds and also identify potentially unwanted off-target effects against the host cell. however, the assays presented in this protocol serve as an analytical platform for mechanism-based identification and evaluation of novel antiviral agents."}
