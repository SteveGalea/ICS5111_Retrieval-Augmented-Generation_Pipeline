{"summary": "aromatase inhibitors are classified into two types: steroidal aromatase inhibitors (SAIs) and non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors (NSAIs). NSAIs bind to the enzyme active site by competing with the substrate. exemestane is widely used because of its oral activation. nnard-Jones and Coulomb potential fields calculate the energies of interactions between the molecular atoms and the probe atom. contour maps obtained by the CoMSIA approach can show how steric fields, electrostatic fields, hydrophobic fields, hydrogen bond donor (HBD) and hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) influence the activity of inhibitors."}
