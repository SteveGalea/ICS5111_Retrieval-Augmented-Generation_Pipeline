{"summary": "xenosurveillance uses host feeding preferences and behaviors of anopheles gambiae to sample viruses in human beings. we hypothesized that mosquito bloodmeals could be used to detect vertebrate viral pathogens within realistic field collection timeframes and clinically relevant concentrations. greater than 60% of EIDs since 1940 are due to zoonotic infections. biosurveillance efforts focus on crucial interfaces in order to identify pathogens with epidemic and pandemic potential. over 3000 described species of mosquitoes are found on every continent except Antarctica. two recent field studies have demonstrated that vertebrate viral pathogens that are not vector-borne could be detected in the bloodmeals of Culicidae mosquitoes [13,14] hematophagous insects, specifically mosquitoes, could make sample acquisition and pathogen surveillance more tractable in remote tropical regions. xenosurveillance can be used in high-risk tropical regions to detect pathogen outbreaks at early stages of emergence. xenosurveillance can be used in high-risk tropical regions to detect pathogen outbreaks. adult mosquitoes were provided with water and 10% sucrose solution ad libitum and were used in experiments 4\u20137 days post-emergence. known concentrations of virus mixed with blood were used to determine if viral RNA could be detected in mosquito bloodmeals. six female hamsters were inoculated intraperitoneally with 0.1 ml of 5 x 106 RNA copies of PIRV or 5 x 104 RNA copies of WNV (three hamsters for each virus) on days two, four and six post infection, the hamsters were anesthetized with an intramuscular injection of 100 mg/ kg of ketamine and 5 mg/ kg xylazine and 10\u201350 l of blood was collected the FTA cards were dried at room temperature for 3 h, placed into CloneSaver multi-barrier pouches containing desiccant. the punches were placed into a 96-well plate with 70 l of RNA rapid extraction solution (Ambion, Austin, TX) the punches were placed into a 96-well plate with 70 l of RNA rapid extraction solution. the qRT-PCR assays were performed in 25 l reactions using the iScript One-step RT-PCR Kit. qRT-PCR amplification was carried out using a standardize program at 50\u00b0C for 20 min, 95\u00b0C for 5min, and 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 10 s and 60\u00b0C for 1 min. the assay lower limits of quantification (LLOQ) for 2 l of blood is 20 RNA copies. mosquito cartons were placed inside a plastic bag container containing a wick dipped in triethylamine for 1\u20132 min. forceps clutching the thorax were used to hold blood fed mosquitoes in place while the contents of the abdomen were pressed onto 96-well format FTA cards. forceps were cleaned with 70% ethanol between mosquitoes using sterile pipet tips. the RNA pools were prepared for NGS using the NuGEN Ovation RNA-Seq System V2 (San Carlos, CA) and Nextera XT DNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) each library was constructed with a unique barcode and subsequently combined into pools of four and sequenced on two lanes of the Illumina HiSeq (Beckman Coulter Genomics, Danvers, MA) pathoMap module was used to align reads to the reference libraries. pathoID was then used to reassign ambiguously aligned reads. pathoReport was used to generate contiguous sequences from the reads that aligned to each genome. the protocol adhered to the guidelines outlined in the Animal Welfare Act Regulations (CSU IACUC: OLAW Animal Welfare Assurance Number: A3572\u201301). the protocol adhered to the guidelines outlined in the Animal Welfare Act Regulations. mosquito bloodmeals were diluted in cell-culture medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum to twice the desired RNA copies/ml concentration. water and sucrose were removed from mosquitoes 12 hours prior to blood feeding. six female hamsters weighing 169\u2013184 g at 11 weeks old were inoculated intraperitoneally with 0.1 ml of 5 x 106 RNA copies of PIRV or 5 x 104 RNA copies of WNV. the hamsters were anesthetized with an intramuscular injection of 100 mg/ kg of ketamine and 5 mg/ kg xylazine and 10\u201350 l of blood was collected via the jugular extraction Extraction of viral RNA from dried blood spots (DBS) were based on previously described methods. a Harris 3 mm micro-puncher (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) was used to remove 1 to 3 punches of the DBS on FTA cards and the punches were placed into a 96-well plate with 70 l of RNA rapid extraction solution. the puncher was cleaned with 70% ethanol between samples. qRT-PCR was carried out using a standardize program at 50\u00b0C for 20 min, 95\u00b0C for 5min, and 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 10 s and 60\u00b0C for 1 min. the assay lower limits of quantification (LLOQ) for 2 l of blood is 20 RNA copies, or 104 RNA copies/ml. forceps clutching the thorax were used to hold blood fed mosquitoes in place. the contents of the abdomen were pressed onto 96-well format FTA cards. forceps were cleaned with 70% ethanol between mosquitoes. each library was constructed with a unique barcode and sequenced on two lanes of the Illumina HiSeq (Beckman Coulter Genomics, Danvers, MA) pathoScope provides a complete bioinformatics framework for quantifying the proportions of reads from individual microbial strains present in sequencing data from samples from environmental or clinical sources. the specific parameters used for each of the PathoScope modules are detailed in S3 Table. 100bp reads were aligned to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV, GenBank V01555.2) and canine distemper virus (CDV, GenBank KM280689.1) genomes using MOSAIK. PCR amplicons were sequenced using the ABI 3100 genetic analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) blood containing approximately 106 RNA copies/ml of WNV or HIV-1 were offered to mosquitoes using artificial membrane feeders. at same time, 2 l of the virus-spiked blood (approximate volume of a mosquito bloodmeal) were diluted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and applied directly onto FTA cards. the concentration of HIV-1 RNA from DBS and M-DBS remained unchanged. the blood-virus mixes (2 l each) were applied to FTA cards before blood feeding (pre-feed) to compare to viral RNA detection from mosquito dried blood spots (M-DBS) the number of blood spots positive (>104 RNA copies/ml) for virus RNA per dried blood spot tested (n = 5) are shown above each time point. the means of the post blood feeding time points were compared to the pre-feed using a one way ANOVA with Dunnet\u2019s multiple comparisons adjustment RNA copies were quantified from the DBS and M-DBS for all time points pre- and post-blood feeding. the number of M-DBS with detectable amounts of WNV RNA decreased over time. 30 RNA copies present in 1\u20133 l bloodmeals fell below the qRT-PCR assays detection limits. qRT-PCR assays detection limits fell below the qRT-PCR assays detection limits. hamsters infected with PIRV had low circulating titers during early infection. on 6 dpi, 15/15 M-DBS were positive for PIRV RNA. qRT-PCR titers greater than the lower limit of quantification. rats of viral RNA titers post blood feeding (mosquito bloodmeals applied onto FTA cards) were used to determine recovery of viral RNA from mosquito bloodfeeding. the post/pre blood feeding ratios between virus-spiked artificial and infected hamster bloodmeal sources were compared using unpaired t tests. NGS analysis of the microbial composition in bloodfed An. gambiae collected within homes in rural liberia revealed the presence of numerous mosquito midgut microbiota (e.g. Acinetobacter and Pantoea) and human skin-associated microbes (e.g. Staphylococcus epidermidis and Propionibacterium acnes) gene signatures for EBV were identified in all eight field-derived M-DBS pools. the presence of an. gambiae, humans, and Plasmodium falciparum from all field-collected sample pools was validated. the presence of P. falciparum in our samples would be expected because malaria is holoendemic in this region and the mosquito may be infected. other organisms EBV d CDV e Reads not aligned b Village A d1\u20132 53,027,225 36,983,929 22,001,739 (59.5%) 247,961 (0.7%) 69,661 (0.2%) 23 0 14,644,568 (39.7%) Village A d3 48,375,950 32,605,957 19,573,355 (60%) 372,789 (1.1%) 63,827 (0.2%) aControl pool generated from laboratory-raised An. gambiae mosquitoes fed upod sheep\u2019s blood. bDenotes reads aligned to EBV strain B95\u20138. eDenotes reads aligned to CDV strain Uy251. WNV and HIV-1 RNA were quantified by qRT-PCR. the concentration of HIV-1 RNA from DBS and M-DBS remained unchanged. however, an insignificant reduction was measured between the DBSs and M-DBSs. application of the blood-virus mix (P = 0.0012) and mosquito bloodmeals (P = 0.0008) to FTA cards resulted in significant losses in WNV RNA detection compared to the original blood-virus mix. the blood-virus mixes (2 l each) were applied to FTA cards before blood feeding (pre-feed) to compare to viral RNA detection from mosquito dried blood spots (M-DBS) the number of blood spots positive (>104 RNA copies/ml) for virus the number of M-DBS with detectable amounts of WNV RNA decreased over time. HIV-1 RNA was detected in all the M-DBS tested. xenosurveillance could effectively detect viral pathogens within clinically relevant ranges. bloodmeal source RNA copies/ml (n positive/n bloodmeals tested) clinical range (RNA copies/ml) Virus 104 105 106 107 108 WNV 0/5 1/5 4/5 5/5 3.2 105 103\u2013105 [30] a HIV-1 0/5 5/5 5/5 n.t. 3.2 104 104\u2013107 [31] PIRV 0/5 0/5 4/5 5/5 n.t. dpi when circulating hamster WNV titers were > 106 RNA copies/ml. but as circulating titers fell below the LLOQ, WNV RNA could be detected in only 6/15 M-DBS. hamsters infected with PIRV had low circulating titers during early infection. post blood feeding (M-DBS) to pre blood feeding (2 l blood applied to FTA cards) were used to determine recovery of viral RNA from mosquitoes taking bloodmeals from artificial and infected hamsters. a ratio 1 indicates a loss of viral RNA recovery through the use of mosquito bloodmeals. ambiae collected within homes in rural liberia revealed the presence of numerous mosquito midgut microbiota (e.g. Acinetobacter and Pantoea) and human skin-associated microbes (e.g. Staphylococcus epidermidis and Propionibacterium acnes) genetic signatures for EBV were identified in all eight field-derived M-DBS pools. this result was confirmed by using RT-PCR to detect EBV-encoded RNA 2 bControl pool generated from laboratory-raised An. gambiae mosquitoes that fed upon sheep\u2019s blood. cUp to four M-DBS from each house aspirated were pooled and used for RNA-sequencing. 27,225 36,983,929 22,001,739 (59.5%) 247,961 (0.7%) 69,661 (0.2%) 23 0 14,644,568 (39.7%) Village A d3 48,375,950 32,605,957 19,573,355 (60%) 372,789 (1.1%) 63,827 (0.2%) 10 0 12,595,986 (38.6%) Village A d4 49,354,744 32,955,955 3,076 (3.5%) 0 0 17,479,782 (58.9%) EBV, Epstein-Barr virus; CDV, canine distemper virus. all pooled M-DBSs contained 100bp reads aligning to EBV. an. gambiae are nocturnal, endophilic feeders that rest on interior walls for several hours after feeding. as a result engorged mosquitoes can be captured during the early morning hours via aspiration. viral RNA remains detectable in the mosquito midgut within a field-relevant time-frame. we determined the detection limits for four different RNA viruses. compared our findings to viral loads in clinically apparent infections [8,30\u201334] we found evidence of two potentially important animal viruses, EBV and CDV. xenosurveillance may be useful for the detection of veterinary or zoonotic pathogens in areas where indoor-resting mosquitoes prefer to feed. xenosurveillance is the process of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting biosphere data in order to provide early detection of biological threats to human or animal health. villagers welcome taking mosquitoes from their houses frequently, which may reduce their risk of future infections from vector-borne pathogens like Plasmodium. xenosurveillance also offers benefits when processing samples. this approach offers increased portability because very few tools/reagents are required. sensitivity and duration of detection still need to be validated for non-virus pathogens. mosquitoes are aspirated, (B) transferred into cartons by house, (C) anesthetized by triethylamine, (D) sorted by blood feeding status and morphologically identified, and (E) the bloodmeals were applied to FTA cards.
