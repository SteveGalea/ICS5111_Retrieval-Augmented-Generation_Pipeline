{"summary": "the development of vaccines faces major difficulties highlighted by the absence of efficient vaccines against major health concern infectious diseases, such as malaria, tuberculosis, and AIDS (1). new high-throughput technologies may lead to a better understanding of genetic variation in resistance to infectious disease and in response to vaccination. antigen selection was a key step in vaccine development in the pre-genomic era. the selection of good candidate vaccine antigens was primarily based on the capacity of induction of protective antibodies. but only a small number of available vaccines are based on recombinant antigens. the number of available viral and parasitic genome sequences is growing continuously (2). advances have been made to make new biostatistics and bioinformatics tools available for candidate gene prospection. the current \u201cgenomic era\u201d is marked by a major impact on the ability to find new candidate vaccine antigens and develop effective vaccines. five of 28 genome-derived candidate antigens are components of a rationally designed vaccine against N. meningitidis serogroup B (10). a formulation of four of these antigens has induced high titers of bactericidal antibodies in a phase I/II clinical trial (11) the multivalent vaccine formulation has been proposed to overcome the issue of antigenic diversity between strains of N. meningitidis. the high intra-species variability is an important limiting factor to the development of vaccines against several diseases such as HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), Plasmodium, and Meningococcus. the vaccine has been extensively used and studied, and shows wide variation in efficacy among populations and geographic regions worldwide. serotype replacement has been documented after the introduction of the heptavalent anti-pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. it can be attributed to the fact that strains not targeted by the vaccine are able to escape vaccine selective pressure (21) new approaches using powerful technologies have advantages and limitations that should be considered in the rational design of a vaccine development project. the contribution of each microbial gene expressed to the disease and to the activation of a protective immune response should be understood. the current data show that there is a wide variety of new molecules that can potentially constitute new vaccine targets. there is accumulating evidence for a genetic control of infectious diseases. several genome-wide linkage analyses have been performed to map resistance or susceptibility genes. major genes have been mapped to chromosomes 5q31-q33 (25) and 6q23 (26) for schistosomiasis, chromosomes 8q12 (27) and 15q/Xq (27) for tuberculosis, chromosomes 10p13 (29,30) and 6q25 (30) for leprosy. the best signals of association were found at the HBB locus for severe malaria (35), at the HLA-DP locus for hepatitis B (41), and at the IL28B locus for hepatitis C (42,43). 500,000 SNPs were genotyped in the HIV, malaria, and hepatitis B studies, while 900,000 SNPs were analyzed in the hepatitis C study. 133 candidates have been simultaneously tested by each research group. it is likely that there are genes involved in both resistance to a particular infectious disease and response to the corresponding candidate vaccines. genes that affect the response to vaccination may be analyzed for their potential role in resistance or susceptibility to the corresponding disease. native children and children in the general US population differed in the incidence of disease due to H. influenzae type b both before and after vaccination. the combination of high throughput methodologies and multifactorial analyses may help in the identification of genetic markers that affect immune and physiological responses leading to serious adverse effects. emergence of new technologies gives illusion that genes controlling a complex phenotype would be easily identified. this is due to the fact that we can obtain a huge amount of biological data for one sample. new approaches have been proposed to tackle this multi-testing problem. a genome-wide association study only detected the association between protection against severe malaria and hemoglobin S after correcting for multi-tests (35), while several other genes and genetic variants have been associated with severe malaria in independent populations (57). the central concept that can drive the development of new approaches is the molecular network. gene-gene interaction studies at genome scale pose multitest problems. analysis of genetic variation and gene expression levels could also provide help in understanding how polymorphisms could perturb a transcriptional network in infectious diseases. gene expression profiles discriminate between genetically cerebral malaria-resistant versus genetically cerebral malaria-susceptible mice. systems Biology is a new rational approach that gives a more comprehensive understanding of networks or interacting components in the immune response to pathogen antigens. this concept has been recently reviewed (67) it can be applied to identify signatures of protection that would be evaluated in the design of new vaccines or predict vaccine efficacy (Systems Vaccinomics) a personalized vaccination strategy would be based on individual information, including genome-wide genetic information. this implies the ability to predict an individual response to the vaccine. the challenge is to develop new tools that are necessary to accurately construct and model molecular networks. the publication of the Haemophilus influenzae genome has opened the mind of scientists to a range of new possible approaches to the study of microorganisms. this approach has been favored in recent years by the use of high-throughput technologies in the fields of genomics, proteomics and immunomics. ia meningitidis serogroups A, C, W135, and Y is available, but not against serogroup B. the entire genome sequence of a virulent strain was analyzed to identify candidates for a new vaccine. 570 of 2158 open reading frames (ORFs) were thus selected. pathogens have developed multiple strategies to evade the immune response, and one of the most commonly used is antigenic variation of immune response targets. the high intra-species variability accounts for the capacity of microbial pathogens to adapt to genetically distinct hosts, different antibiotics, or immune system defense mechanisms. a bacterial species could be characterized by its global gene repertoire. this concept has been used to characterize intraspecies diversity in a novel approach for the discovery of new vaccine candidate molecules. however, underrepresented strains not targeted by the multivalent vaccine may become a matter of concern after broad vaccine coverage is established. the combination of single nucleotide polymorphisms and gene expression data should help in building molecular networks that are critical for mounting protective immune responses. despite the amount of available data about the genome of pathogens and the human genome, the genes, molecules, and mechanisms involved in pathogen virulence or in host defense are still not clear. rare primary immunodeficiencies have been shown to cause susceptibility to either multiple infectious agents or to a single type of infectious agent. several candidate genes have been associated with infectious diseases (23). candidate gene approach further supports role of human genetics in resistance or susceptibility to infectious diseases. IL13 polymorphisms have been associated with schistosomiasis (36), mild malaria (37,38), and leprosy (39) the best signals of association were found at the HBB locus for severe malaria (35), at the HLA-DP locus for hepatitis B (41), and at the IL28B locus for hepatitis C (42,43). early papers have reported a heritability of 61 and 77% for the antibody response to the hepatitis B surface antigen vaccine in adults (45) and young children (46) it should be stressed that high levels of antibody against hepatitis B surface antigen correlate with protection against infection and persistent carriage (47) the Fulani produce higher antibody levels than the Mossi and the Rimaibe. they have lower parasite densities and fewer and milder malaria attacks. the Fulani are more resistant against malaria than the Mossi and the Rimaibe. international scientific and medical community would be able to screen for millions of polymorphisms within each potential target group. developing a health system in which each individual would be genotyped at the genome scale would become a political and economic choice. the challenge is less technological than conceptual. new approaches have been proposed (55,56) to tackle this multi-testing problem. this lack is highlighted by the results obtained in genome-wide linkage and association in infectious diseases. the biological concept of the gene network implies the existence of gene-gene interactions that are generally not taken into account in genome-wide linkage and association analyses. the influence of TLR2 and TIRAP polymorphisms on clinical disease caused by M. tuberculosis has been found to depend on pathogen genotypes. in humans, blood cell gene expression profiles have been associated with the clinical status of patients infected with different pathogens. in humans, blood cell gene expression profiles have been associated with the clinical status of patients infected with different pathogens. in humans, blood cell gene expression profiles have been used to monitor the response to BCG vaccination in children (65). genome-based approaches should help in developing vaccines against old, but so far uncontrolled infectious diseases. the identification of relevant molecular targets will require further research on protective immune responses and the development of immunological tools. the challenge is to develop new tools that are necessary to accurately construct and model molecular networks."}
