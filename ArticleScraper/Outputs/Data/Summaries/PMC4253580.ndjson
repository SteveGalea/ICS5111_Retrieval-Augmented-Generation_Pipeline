{"summary": "five Sprague\u2013Dawley rats (Crl:SD; 4 male, 1 female; age, birth to 6 mo) were donated from an inhouse colony after detection of a spontaneous infestation with S. muris. all animals used in this study were either the 5 initial positive animals or their offspring. all experimental procedures were reviewed and approved by the Johns Hopkins University Animal Care and Use Committee. a single piece of cellophane tape was firmly applied to the anal region 3 consecutive times at each time point. eggs were counted using a 4 microscope objective. we euthanized 24 rats via carbon dioxide asphyxiation at day 124. the gastrointestinal tract was exposed, and the cecum and colon were placed in a culture dish. the numbers of worms in the cecum and colon were counted and recorded. slides with eggs were immersed in the hatching solution within glass slide-staining receptacles. the sticky surface was placed outward to facilitate exposure of the eggs to the hatching solution. slides were removed, rinsed with de-ionized water, and then read under a 10 microscope objective. chlorine dioxide generator was placed within a rodent cage-changing station. temperature was maintained at 20 \u00b0C, and humidity was 38% within the station. biologic indicators were included in the treatment run of the gaseous form. 2 tests were used to compare proportions of hatched eggs in experimental compared with control samples for viability and disinfectant experiments. data were analyzed by using a commercial statistical software package (PRISM version 6.0, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) five Sprague\u2013Dawley rats were donated from an inhouse colony after detection of a spontaneous infestation with S. muris during routine colony health surveillance. the animal care and use program is accredited by AAALAC. animals were maintained in accordance with the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals. a single piece of cellophane tape was applied to the anal region 3 consecutive times at each time point. d 12 female and 12 male rats for a total of 24 animals. the 2 litters were asynchronous in time. the first perianal tape test was performed. samples were read and the numbers of eggs recorded. hatching medium was titrated to a pH of approximately 7.2. this pH reflected both our success rates in pilot studies and ideal values reported in the literature.3,38 Hatching protocol. chlorine dioxide liquid (MB10 tablets, Quip Laboratories, Wilmington, DE) at concentrations of 100 or 200 mg/L chlorine dioxide gas at 400 mg/L. slides were submerged in liquid for 10 min or exposed to the gas form for 2 h. temperature was maintained at 20 \u00b0C, and humidity was 38% within the wrapped station. rats were considered pinworm-positive if they had at least one positive tape test. this percentage was calculated for the perianal tape test, cecal\u2013colonic direct examination, and for both tests combined at necropsy. results Peak daytime egg counts occurred at 1400 daily. egg counts return to 0 repeatedly at 2- to 3-wk intervals throughout the infestation. female rats shed more eggs than male rats. female rats shed more eggs than male rats. colonic counts and colonic counts varied significantly by subject (P 0.05) among 24 rats, 3 were negative for infestation on all tests, another 3 were negative by tape test but had worms in the cecum or colon. 6 more rats were positive by tape test but lacked worms in the cecum or colon. 69.2% of S. muris eggs still hatched, indicating continued viability for the majority of the sample. wk after the time of collection, 69.2% of the eggs still hatched. 100 mg/L chlorine dioxide liquid 269 124 84.8 61.2 0.01 200 mg/L chlorine dioxide liquid 100 263 96.0 32.7 0.01 400 mg/L chlorine dioxide gas 401 599 85.0 0.3 0.01 Controls consisted of eggs collected at same time but not exposed to the testing agent. hatched eggs are considered viable and capable of infection. egg counts return to 0 repeatedly at 2- to 3-wk intervals throughout the infestation. shedding at weaning (day 21) was not significantly different from that at 124 d of age. correlation of worm burden at necropsy and perimortem egg count. egg count on perianal tape test did not correlate with either cecal (r = 0.39) or colonic (r = 0.42) pinworm counts at necropsy. 69.2% of S. muris eggs still hatched, indicating continued viability for the majority of the sample. control eggs were collected during the previous 24 h and experimental eggs were aged 4 to 30 wk prior to testing in the hatching protocol. d forms were significantly (P 0.01) less effective at preventing hatching than was the gaseous form of chlorine dioxide. Hatching rates of Syphacia muriseggs exposed to 3 forms of chlorine dioxide No. of eggs counted Hatching rate (%) Disinfectant Control Treated P (2 test) 100 mg/L chlorine dioxide liquid 269 124 84.8 61.2 0.01 200 mg/L chlorine dioxide liquid 100 263 96.0 32.7 0.01 400 mg/L chlorine dioxide gas 401 5 the exact evolutionary mechanism for a circadian rhythm of egg release varies for each parasite and can be understood in terms of either the ability to increase local transmission or the ability to promote widespread dispersal of infective forms. egg counts in subjects dropped to 0 for several weeks before infestation was reestablished. results differ from those of colleagues who found 100% sensitivity in tape tests performed at various times of the day to detect S. muris. male mice have higher Aspiculuris burdens than female mice. similar observations have been noted in male hamsters. female rats shed more eggs at 1400 than male rats. a chlorine dioxide disinfectant was used in rodent facilities. a hatching rate was 3.6% for a 2-h exposure to 75 mg/L liquid chlorine dioxide. this is a markedly high ovicidal rate compared to other compounds. sex-associated differences are believed to result from the role of testosterone in parasite-host burdens and its negative influence on the immune system. female rats shed more eggs at 1400 than male rats, suggesting that rats infected with S. muris either become resistant to infection during the first 4 mo of life. samples from rats between weaning and 4 mo of age are equally likely to detect S. muris infestation within a mixed-age colony. viability decreased with time, but 69.2% of S. muris eggs hatched at 30 wk after deposition, indicating continued viability at this time point. this study constitutes the first report of the use of chlorine dioxide gas with S. muris eggs. if testing occurs at 1400, female rats are more likely to test positive than male rats. if testing occurs at 1400, female rats are more likely to test positive than male rats."}
