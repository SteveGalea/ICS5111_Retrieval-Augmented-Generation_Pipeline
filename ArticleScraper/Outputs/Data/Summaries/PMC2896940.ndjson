{"summary": "analysis of pandemic preparedness plans in the six Asian countries reveals that the translation of these strategic plans into operational plans is still lacking in some countries particularly those with low resources. the aim of this study is to understand the pandemic preparedness programmes, the health systems context, and challenges and constraints specific to the six Asian countries. a number of suggestions for improvement were presented to strengthen the pandemic preparation and mitigation. the world health organization (WHO) raised the level of influenza pandemic alert from Phase 3 to Phase 4. a spokesman for the WHO regional office for the western Pacific declared that \"Asia is better prepared and in a better position than others\" a review of strategic pandemic preparedness plans in Asia in 2006 and a report on regional preparedness published by the United Nations System Influenza Coordinator (UNSIC) in 2007 reveals that the translation of these strategic plans into operational plans is still lacking in many countries in the region. this paper presents the results from a rapid situation analysis of health system and pandemic preparedness in six countries of the Asia-Pacific region prior to the H1N1/2009 epidemic. 'pandemic preparedness programme element' assesses specific pandemic influenza programme components embedded within a health system (horizontal level) for each element, the components under review are: external context; stewardship and organisational arrangements; financing, resource generation and allocation; healthcare provision; and information systems. the scope of this study is limited to health system and health service response and preparation for pandemic influenza. non-health sector preparation and mitigation efforts are beyond the scope of this analysis. the choice of the six countries is based on an historical assessment that they would likely be at the epicentre of an influenza pandemic. 62 68 60 77.89 72 72 Hospital beds (per 10,000 population) 1 2004 5.2 2005 12 2005

Project; # Government budget only External resources have been substantial for low income countries, particularly Lao PDR and Cambodia. there was no external financial support for Taiwan and less than 3 percent in Thailand. pandemic vaccine has a plan to increase its capacity towards pandemic vaccine production by 2010. all countries had stockpiles of antivirals and personal protective equipment. but the size of the stockpiles varied across countries. only Taiwan and Viet Nam had explicit plans for surveillance and response in time of pandemic. all countries have assigned referral hospitals to take care of AHI cases in the pre-pandemic phases. a number of simulation exercises have been conducted in all six countries. most of the exercises were table-top style where relevant officers discuss and manage a hypothetical pandemic situation in a round-table manner. only Indonesia and Taiwan had full-scale exercises involving real field activities. the level of economic development ranges from low income with high agricultural share (Lao PDR, Cambodia, and Viet Nam), middle income (Thailand and Indonesia) to industrialized and high income (Taiwan) there is similarity in that all countries enjoyed relative political stability (except recently in Thailand) current health status and epidemiological profile Taiwan shows a pattern of industrialized economies post epidemiological transition with low mortality, high life expectancy, and high disease burden from chronic diseases. in contrast to Taiwan, lao PDR and Cambodia have lower life expectancy with high morbidity and mortality from communicable diseases. the proportion of skilled birth attendance was over 80% in Thailand and Viet Nam, around two-third in Indonesia, nearly 50% in Cambodia and less than 20% in lao PDR in 2006. there were 63, nine, and two confirmed cases in Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia respectively. all have national pandemic preparedness plans and AHI response plans. however, the governance arrangements and the nature of the plans differ across the countries. in all countries, pandemic preparedness committees were headed by the president or prime minister or his/her representative. most countries spent around 1 USD per capita per year or less on these activities. the level of to the disease was highest in 2006 and 2007, it declined in 2008. all countries but Cambodia had discretionary budget for local level administration to use on AHI and pandemic preparation. pandemic preparedness activities relied on existing healthcare workforce in the public sector. shortage of highly skilled workers was a major problem in all developing countries. most, except Taiwan and Viet Nam, did not have a plan for surge capacity. in most countries, the antiviral stockpiles were located at both central level and at hospital and local health authorities. in addition to national stockpiles, there was an ASEAN regional stockpile in Singapore. surveillance and rapid containment activities concentrated on surveillance and rapid containment activities in all countries but Taiwan. training on clinical management of AHI cases has been conducted in all six countries. there was a policy to provide antiviral prophylaxis to AHI contacts. there was no clear rationing policy on antiviral distribution in case of pandemic. only Indonesia and Taiwan had full-scale exercises involving real field activities. most exercises reveal management and coordination constitutes weakness in preparedness. most simulations exercises focus on early containment but not on pandemic preparedness in later phases. pandemic preparation is high on national political agenda because of its previous history of SARS outbreak and casualties as well as a perceived threat of bioterrorism. pandemic preparation is high on national political agenda because of its previous history of SARS outbreak and casualties as well as a perceived threat of bioterrorism. emergence of human cases of H5N1 may have led each of the five countries to strongly assume outbreaks could start within their own country. lack of internal resources may have yielded to limited investment in pharmaceutical interventions such as antiviral and vaccine stockpiling. investment in pandemic preparedness has contributed to strengthening of health system functions in many countries specifically in regards to surveillance, laboratory capacity, monitoring and evaluation. limited stockpiles of the antivirals, covering 1% or less of the population in all countries other than Taiwan, raise the issue of drug allocation when a large-scale high-impact pandemic occurs. a revision/reposition of public education campaigns that were shown to be focusing on animal to human transmission in many Southeast Asian countries. governance and stewardship of AHI and pandemic preparedness should be integrated into the broader disaster preparedness system. pandemic and disaster responses could tap into the capacity of private non-profit network and volunteers to support the scaling up of necessary responses. pandemic and disaster responses could also tap into the capacity of private non-profit network and volunteers. a number of research activities are now going on as part of the AsiaFluCap project. this includes the analyses of health system capacity and resource distribution in the country. a pandemic could create adverse social events beyond health impacts. underlying assumption that the pandemic would start from avian influenza virus mutation within the country led to heavy investment on surveillance and case detection mechanisms in the five developing countries. these mechanisms were designed primarily for AHI with reliance on poultry contact history in the surveillance and case detection operational guidelines and unlikely to be effective for early-detection and containment of pandemic influenza. study shows that health systems provide important context towards the success of the responses. governance and stewardship of AHI and pandemic preparedness should be integrated into the broader disaster preparedness system. the pandemic and disaster responses could tap into the capacity of private non-profit network and volunteers to support the scaling up of necessary responses. a pandemic could create adverse social events beyond health impacts and interrupt essential services such as food logistics or water and electricity supply systems. the health system context influences how the six countries have been preparing themselves for a pandemic. the level and form of pandemic preparedness depend on existing health systems arrangements particularly its governance, resource, and existing service provision patterns. a number of suggestions for improvement were presented to strengthen the pandemic preparation and mitigation. authors' contributions Design of the study: RC, SMJ, AC, RK, RC, WA, PNC, BP, WP, CSS, ST.
