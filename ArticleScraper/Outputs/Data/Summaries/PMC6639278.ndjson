{"summary": "the etiological agent, PRRS virus (PRRSV) has a positive-polarity single-stranded RNA genome, approximately 15 kb in length, encoding two nonstructural polyproteins (ORF1ab and ORF1b) and eight structural proteins (GP2, E, GP3, GP4, GP5, ORF5a, M, and N) tyrosine kinases phosphorylate the two intracellular tyrosine kinases Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) transcription factors interact with IFN regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) to form IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) (11) many viruses have developed elaborate strategies to circumvent the JAK/STAT pathway in IFN signaling. PRRSV nsp11 inhibits type I IFN production through nidovirus-specific endoribonuclease (NendoU) activity-dependent mechanisms (19\u201321) however, the activity of overexpressed nsp11 unexpectedly exhibited extensive substrate specificity in vitro. this indicates that the inhibition of IFN production by wild-type (WT) PRRSV nsp11 may be due to its cytotoxicity. PRRSV nsp11 significantly inhibited the transcription of ISGs induced by IFN- compared with the control group results. nsp11 strongly inhibited IFN--induced ISRE promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner in HEK-293T cells. PRRSV nsp11 inhibits type I IFN signaling in an endoribonuclease activity-independent manner. in arterivirus, the nsp11 endoribonuclease is important for viral replication. se activity of the three HA-tagged nsp11 mutants was significantly decreased compared with the WT nsp11. however, none of the endoribonuclease inactive mutants showed a loss of the ability of nsp11 to inhibit ISRE promoter activity in cells overexpressing nsp11 mutants. HEK-293T cells cultured in 24-well plates were transfected with PRRSV nsp11 expression plasmid or vector. after 24 h, cells were treated with 1,000 U/ml of IFN- for 8 h. HEK-293T cells were cotransfected with PRRSV nsp11 or its endoribonuclease activity-defective mutants. each endoribonuclease mutant suppressed the ISGF3-mediated IRES promoter. PRRSV nsp11 does not degrade or block the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2. PRRSV nsp11 does not affect the protein level of ISGF3 or the phosphorylation status of STAT1/2. after 24 h, cells were treated with IFN- (1,000 U/ml) for 4 h. lysates from nsp11-expressing cells were subjected to Western blotting. the levels of phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2 were greatly increased after IFN- treatment. no difference was found between nsp11-expressing cells and nsp11-nonexpressing cells. nsp11 and PRRSV nsp11 were analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-IRF9 antibody and an anti-HA antibody. reciprocal pulldown of both nsp11 and endogenous IRF9 confirmed the interaction between nsp11 and IRF9. HEK-293T cells were cotransfected with an expression vector encoding HA-nsp11. horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG heavy chain was used to eliminate interference between nsp11 and IgG light chain. HEK-293T cells were cotransfected with expression construct HA-nsp11 and with the indicated plasmids of porcine IRF9 for 30 h. PRRSV nsp11-IRF9 interaction impairs the IFN-induced formation and nuclear accumulation of ISGF3. PRRSV nsp11-IRF9 interaction impairs the IFN-induced formation and nuclear accumulation of ISGF3. endogenous IRF9 was precipitated and immunoblotting analysis was performed. anti-pSTAT1 antibody (the top panel), anti-pSTAT2 antibody (the second panel) or anti-HA antibody (the fourth panel) was used to detect the interaction with endogenous IRF9. nsp11 impairs the formation and nuclear translocation of ISGF3. nsp11 mutants still inhibited the formation and nuclear accumulation of ISGF3. nsp11 was coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous IRF9 in PRRSV-infected cells. the formation of STAT1/STAT2/IRF9 heterotrimers was significantly inhibited following PRRSV infection. the levels of STAT1-Y701, STAT2-Y690, and IRF9 proteins were reduced in the nuclear fraction of PRRSV-infected cells after IFN- stimulation. Marc-145 cells were immunoblotted with an anti-nsp11 antibody (the second panel), an anti-pSTAT1 antibody (the third panel), or an anti-pSTAT2 antibody (the fourth panel) to detect the interaction with endogenous IRF9. the experiment was parallel to that outlined for panel A. 15 ISG15, ISG54, ISG56, and 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1) were analyzed in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293T) overexpressing hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged PRRSV nsp11 significantly inhibited the transcription of ISGs induced by IFN- compared with the control group results. PRRSV nsp11 inhibits type I IFN signaling in an endoribonuclease activity-independent manner. in arterivirus, the nsp11 endoribonuclease is important for viral replication. the levels of endoribonuclease activity of the three HA-tagged nsp11 mutants were significantly decreased compared with the WT nsp11. however, none of the endoribonuclease inactive mutants showed a loss of the ability of nsp11 to inhibit ISRE promoter activity in cells overexpressing nsp11 mutants. PRRSV nsp11-mediated inhibition of type I IFN signaling is independent of its endoribonuclease activity. the endoribonuclease activity of HA-tagged PRRSV nsp11 and its mutants is indicated with different colors. values representing results of experiments performed in triplicate are presented. transcription factor complex ISGF3 is composed of STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9 (11) coexpression of nsp11 significantly activated the ISRE promoter. however, activation of the ISRE promoter by ISGF3 was significantly inhibited in the presence of PRRSV nsp11. however, each endoribonuclease inactive mutant was also able to suppress the ISGF3-induced IRES promoter. PRRSV nsp11 does not degrade or block the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2. after 30 h, cells were harvested for luciferase assays. we investigated whether nsp11 impairs the endogenous protein levels. PRRSV nsp11 and its endoribonuclease inactive mutants do not target the ISGF3 complex for degradation or prevent type I IFN-induced STAT1 protein-activating tyrosine phosphorylation. lysates from nsp11-expressing cells were subjected to Western blotting. p11 protein and flag-tagged porcine STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9 interacted with nsp11, but not STAT1 or STAT2. coprecipitated endogenous IRF9 and PRRSV nsp11 were analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-IRF9 antibody and an anti-HA antibody. horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG light chain was used to eliminate interference between nsp11 and IgG light chain. hek-293T cells were cotransfected with expression construct HA-nsp11 and with the indicated plasmids of porcine IRF9. PRRSV nsp11-IRF9 interaction impairs the IFN-induced formation and nuclear accumulation of ISGF3. nsp11-IRF9 interaction impairs the recruitment of phosphorylated STAT2 by IRF9 and subsequent nuclear accumulation of ISGF3. PRRSV nsp11-IRF9 interaction inhibits IFN-induced nuclear accumulation of ISGF3. HEK-293T cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding HA-nsp11 and its mutants. anti-pSTAT1 antibody (the top panel), anti-pSTAT2 antibody (the second panel), or anti-HA antibody (the fourth panel) was performed. transfected cells were infected with PRRSV for 24 h and then collected at 4 h after IFN- treatment for immunoprecipitation with anti-nsp11. the results indicate that PRRSV nsp11 impairs the formation and nuclear translocation of ISGF3. these mutants, lacking endoribonuclease activity, still impaired the formation and nuclear accumulation of ISGF3. nsp11 was coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous IRF9 in PRRSV-infected cells. phosphorylated STAT1/STAT2 was also coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous IRF9 upon IFN- stimulation. however, formation of STAT1/STAT2/IRF9 heterotrimers was significantly inhibited following PRRSV infection. Marc-145 cells were either mock infected or infected with PRRSV. at 24 h postinfection, the cells were mock-treated or treated with IFN- (1000 IU/ml) for 4 h or left untreated. PRRSV infection has been found to produce abnormally low levels of type I IFNs. the endoribonuclease encoded within the PRRSV nsp11 sequence has been found to be a multifunctional protein. previously, it has been demonstrated that PRRSV nsp11 is involved in the inhibition of IFN production through multiple distinct mechanisms. PRRSV nsp11 belongs to the Xenopus laevis poly(U)-specific endoribonuclease (XendoU) superfamily. the structures of the arterivirus nsp11, coronavirus (CoV) nsp15, and XendoU catalytic domains were found to be highly conserved. previous studies have shown that PRRSV WT nsp11 is toxic to e. coli and that the expression levels of WT nsp11 are extremely low. recombinant nsp11 of equine arteritis virus (EAV) has been reported to be extremely toxic to a variety of hosts. type I IFN signaling can control viral infections by activating the transcription factor complex ISGF3 (STAT1/STAT2/IRF9) it is becoming increasingly apparent that IRF9 is a central factor not only for mediation of but also for regulation and direction of type I IFN responses (44). studies of IRF9 deficiency revealed unique roles for IRF9 that were distinct from those of STAT1 and STAT2 (45, 46) PRRSV nsp11 adopts a mechanism distinct from that of nsp1, i.e., interaction with IRF9, an essential component in the formation of ISGF3. it is well established that IRF9 exhibits several functionally conserved regions among the members of the IRF family, such as an N-terminal DNA-binding domain that recognizes and binds to ISRE motifs. the three-dimensional (3D) structures of arterivirus nsp11 (K173A in PRRSV nsp11; H141A and K170A in EAV nsp11) are remarkably similar to those of WT PRRSV nsp11 (21, 23), with an overall root mean square deviation (RMSD) range of 0.408 to 2.000. the ability to interact with IRF9 correlated with the correct folding of nsp11 the nsp11-IRF9 interaction is involved in inhibition of the formation and nuclear translocation of ISGF3. this novel function of PRRSV nsp11 offers new insight into the interaction between a viral EndoU and the IFN signaling pathway. the nsp11 gene of PRRSV strain WUH3 was amplified and titrated as described previously (15) nsp11 mutants (H129A, H144A, and K173A) were cloned into pGEX-6p-1 with a glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag in the N terminus. PEDV nsp15 mutants (H226A) were constructed using PEDV nsp15 as the template. 0.05 were considered statistically significant, and P values of 0.01 were considered highly statistically significant. total RNA was extracted from cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and RNA (1 g) was reverse transcribed into cDNA using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (TaKaRa, Japan) the harvested fusion proteins with an N-terminally GST tag were incubated with GST-3C rhinovirus protease at a ratio of 40:1 for 8 h at 4\u00b0C. the target proteins were eluted by the use of 10 ml cleavage buffer. lysis buffer was harvested with 20 nM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitor (Sigma, USA) samples were then separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. overexpression of STAT1, STAT2, IRF9, and IRF9 deletion mutants was evaluated. the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were subjected to Western blotting. rabbit polyclonal antibodies against heat shock protein 90 (HSP90; Proteintech, China) and PARP1 (Proteintech, China) were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay. at 24 h postinfection, cells were mock treated or treated with recombinant human IFN- (PBL Assay Science) for 4 h. cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and immediately permeabilized using methanol (precooled at 20\u00b0C) after three washes with PBS, cells were incubated with 5% bovine serum albumin. the luciferase reporter plasmid ISRE-Luc contained IFN-stimulated response elements in the promoter of most of the ISGs cloned upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene. PRRSV nsp11 mutants (H129A, H144A, and K173A) were constructed by overlap extension PCR using specific mutagenic primers. plasmids of HEK-293T or PK-15 cells were cotransfected with plasmid ISRE-Luc. cells were lysed 8 h later, and firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using a dual-luciferase reporter assay system. the recombinant prokaryotic expression plasmids were transformed into E. coli strain Trans BL21(DE3) and cultured at 37\u00b0C in LB medium containing 50 g/ml ampicillin. the cells were induced by the use of 0.8 mM IPTG (isopropyl-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside) for 7 h at 27\u00b0C. the RNA substrate was placed in a reaction buffer containing 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mM KCl, and 1 mM dithiothreitol. the endoribonuclease activity was monitored every 10 min for 60 min. the results were analyzed by the use of GraphPad Prism software 5.0. phospho-STAT1 (STAT1-Y701, Cell Signaling Technology, USA) and phospho-STAT2 (STAT2-Y690, ABclonal, China) were used to detect the protein levels and phosphorylated forms of each endogenous protein. monoclonal antibody (MAb) against PRRSV nsp11 was produced from hybridoma cells derived from Sp2/0 myeloma cells. 500 g of cell lysate protein was incubated with 0.5 g of the indicated antibody and 25 l of protein A+G agarose overnight at 4\u00b0C. precipitates were then washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer. IgG (H+L) antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 or anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 was diluted to 1:500. cells were stained with 4\u2019,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Beyotime, Nantong, China)\u2013PBS for 15 min."}
