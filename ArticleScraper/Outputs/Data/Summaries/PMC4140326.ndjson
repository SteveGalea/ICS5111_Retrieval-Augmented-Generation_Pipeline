{"summary": "increased frequency in the use of the Internet via computer or mobile devices provides an opportunity for social media to be the medium through which users can be provided with valuable health information quickly and quickly. social media platforms such as twitter and facebook are the open forum spaces in which social networks are created and maintained. web-based analytics has given public health officers and physicians an earlier insight into the emergence and spread of infectious diseases. analysis of user searches for infectious disease intelligence and surveillance is now possible with web-based analytics developed by companies such as google and Yahoo. the network indicated a statistically significant spike in the pattern of listeriosis-related searches nearly a month before the declaration of the outbreak. in both cases, the network-based intelligence predicted a public health crisis before it was officially declared. social media-based models can track infectious disease trends in real time. l physicians were better for the status of the current week than for predicting the next week. they used Yahoo to predict an increase in culture positive for flu 1-3 weeks in advance. their model was predicated on the theory that the pattern of how and when people search may provide clues about future health-related concerns and expectations. study conducted by Ginsberg et al.8 on aggregated search volumes towards the early detection of disease activity. these query trends were then correlated to the percentage of physician visits in which a patient displays ILI. search query-based predictive models may give public health professionals a greater advantage in developing earlier responses to seasonal outbreaks of flu. the system remains susceptible to false alerts resulting from ILI inquiries unrelated to the actual occurrence of flu in any one population group. social media and web searches have the ability to make this prediction more immediate. high priority groups identified in an outbreak may be best for individual protection. high priority groups for the H1N1 vaccine were health care workers and people at risk of severe complications if infected. data mining gives a uniform voice to the web-connected public for the purpose of flu surveillance. previous efforts aimed at estimating the flu prevalence in a population relied solely upon extrapolation of formally diagnosed cases. public health officials could then analyse the aggregated and tamed data to determine the relevance of computer-indicated trends. corley et al. compared the two data series with a Pearson statistic of r=0.545 with 95% confidence. a holistic approach to disease tracking could incorporate emerging sources of web-based intelligence into traditional methodologies currently in use by epidemiologists. if someone has neither the time nor desire to meet directly with a public health official or physician, he or she could simply blog or tweet a statement similar to I\u2019m coming down with the flu. multiple web-based programmes must be used in combination. previously, web-based programmes that housed different data sources had to be used independently of one another. mashups integrate numerical and spatial data for public health decisions. public health officials can combine intuitive GIS displays with geocoded health data. they can also be continuously updated and changed at any time and in any location through the use of web API. new web-based platforms promise increased opportunities for more timely and accurate information dissemination and analysis."}
