{"summary": "Newcastle disease is considered to be the most significant and widespread infectious disease in commercial poultry. the clinical manifestation of NDV strains varies significantly due to the degree of strain virulence and host susceptibility. in chickens, the clinical manifestation of NDV strains varies due to the degree of strain virulence and host susceptibility. in 1948, genotype IX emerged as a unique group including the first virulent NDV strains (F48E9) in south china. members of the genotype are occasionally isolated from a wild variety of bird species. many newly emergent strains contribute to increasing the global burden of NDV and cause enormous losses in the poultry industry. s subject to high morbidity and mortality if infected with virulent NDV strains. some type 1 pigeon paramyxoviruses behave similarly to non-virulent viruses. PPMV-1 strains may evolve into virulent viruses and induce major outbreaks. PPMV-1 can be transmitted from infected pigeons to chickens placed in nave contact. duck-origin NDV isolate can infect chickens and ducks and be transmitted to nave contact chickens and ducks. however, little information is available regarding the pathogenicity and transmission of the virus among chickens, ducks, and pigeons. oropharyngeal and cloacal swab specimens were collected from commercial chickens, ducks, and pigeons. samples were inoculated in 10-days-old specific-pathogen-free embryonated chicken eggs. a total of 23 NDV strains were isolated.

GM, YF18, and GZ289 viruses showed remarkable replication in various tissues of SPF chickens. mean titers were 8.75, 8.25, and 3.42 log10EID50 in the spleen. in the GM inoculated chicken, the mean titers were from 6.50 to 8.75 log10EID50 in the tested tissues. GM virus replicated more highly in the chickens. chickens were inoculated with 106 EID50 of the indicated virus. tissues, including thymus, cecal tonsils, bursa of Fabricius, trachea, lung, brain, kidney, and spleen were collected aseptically on three DPI from three chickens. all of the chickens died at the end of the observation period. the GM virus was recovered from the oropharyngeal (4.79 log10EID50) on 3 DPI. it was shed from the oropharynx in inoculated chickens within 5 DPI. but, it only could be shed from the cloaca within 3 DPI (4.92 log10EID50) 0.62 (6/6) 2.88 0.52 (6/6) ND (0/3) ND (0/3) ND (0/3) ND (0/3) ND (0/3) ND (0/3) ND (0/3) ND (0/3) ND (0/3) ND (0/3) ND (0/3) ND (0/3) ND (0/3) OP, oropharyngeal swabs; CL, cloacal swabs; all of the chickens died at the end of the wabs at 3, 5, and 7 DPI (3.00\u20134.00 log10EID50 and 3.00\u20134.17 log10EID50 respectively) the nave contact chickens housed with GZ289 virus still survived in 14 DPI, but none seroconverted. GM and YF18 were highly pathogenic to chickens, and could be transmitted by contact with nave chickens. ducks were inoculated with 106 EID50 of the indicated virus in a volume of 200 L. Tissues, including thymus, cecal tonsils, bursa of Fabricius, trachea, lung, brain, kidney, and spleen were collected aseptically on three DPI from three ducks. ducks that showed clinical signs, such as depression, torticollis, incoordination, and tremors were counted as sick animals. c No. S.C./total shows the number of ducks that seroconverted out of the total number of ducks at the end of the observation period. GM, YF18, and GZ289 viruses shedding from inoculated ducks were detected in oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs at 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 DPI. yF18 virus shedding was detected in the oropharynx in inoculated ducks within 7 DPI (1.96 and 1.58 log10EID50, respectively) ND (0/3) ND (0/3) ND (0/3) ND (0/3) ND (0/3) ND (0/3) ND (0/3) ND (0/3) ND (0/3) ND (0/3) ND (0/3) ND (0/3) ND (0/3) ND (0/3) ND (0/3) ND (0/3) ND (0/3) ND (0/3) ND (0/3) ND (0/3) ND (0/3) ND (0/3) ND (0 no ducks in the nave contact group inoculated with the GM, YF18, or GZ289 virus died. cloacal swabs did not show any detectable virus during the period. GM and GZ289 viruses could infect ducks, but they could not be transmitted by nave contact. pigeons inoculated with GM and YF18 virus showed high titers (9.3 log2), whereas two pigeons in contact group seroconverted with relatively high titers (6.0 log2). the HI titers of groups inoculated with the virus were 8.3 log2, and 8.7 log2, respectively. pigeons were culated with 106 EID50 of the indicated virus in a volume of 200 L via the intraocular and intranasal routes. pigeons that showed clinical signs, such as depression, torticollis, incoordination, and tremors, were counted as sick animals. a value of 1.5 was assigned if the virus was not detected from the undiluted sample in three SPF embryonated chicken eggs. GM, YF18, and GZ289 viruses replicated only in some tested tissues. mean virus titers were 1.67, 2.33, 1.83, 1.75, and 2.08 log10EID50 respectively. GM, YF18, and GZ289 viruses replicated more highly than the other two viruses in tested tissues of infected pigeons.

GM, YF18, and GZ289 strains clustered into class II genotypes VII, IX, and VI respectively. 23 NDV strains derived from chickens, ducks, and pigeons in LBMs were virulent or avirulent circulating in south china. this suggests that NDV may be transmitted between types of domestic poultry and pigeons in south China. no symptom was observed in the GM, YF18, and GZ289-inoculated chickens. GM, YF18, and GZ289 viruses were replicated systemically in various tissues of SPF chickens on 3 DPI. chickens were inoculated with 106 EID50 of the indicated virus in a volume of 200 L via the intraocular and intranasal routes. all of the chickens died at the end of the observation. three uninoculated chickens were co-housed with infected chickens. GM, YF18, and GZ289 viruses shedding from the inoculated chickens were detected in oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs at 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 DPI. a value of 1.5 was assigned if virus was not detected from the undiluted sample in three embryonated hen's eggs. three chickens were inoculated with 200 L PBS via the same routes as a nave. in nave contact-group chickens, housed with inoculated GM chickens, died within 7 DPI. GM virus was recovered from the oropharyngeal swabs (4.00\u20134.13 log10EID50) and from the cloacal swabs (3.75\u20133.92 log10EID50) at 3 and 5 DPI. we inoculated each duck with 106 EID50 of the indicated virus in 200 L via intraocular and intranasal routes. the remaining ducks were observed clinically for 14 days. all ducks in the three infected virus groups survived during the period of infection. ducks were inoculated with 106 EID50 of the indicated virus in a volume of 200 L. Tissues, including thymus, cecal tonsils, bursa of Fabricius, trachea, lung, brain, kidney, and spleen were collected aseptically on three DPI from three ducks. thymus, cecal tonsils, bursa of Fabricius, trachea, lung, brain, kidney, and spleen replicated more highly in the lungs. the mean virus titers in the thymus, cecal tonsils, bursa of fabricius, trachea, lung, brain, kidney, and spleen were 3.33, 2.67, 2.75, 1.92, 1.58, 3.58, and 2.83 log10EID50 Viruses Days post-inoculation (log10EID50/0.1 mL) SDa 3 Days 5 Days 7 Days 9 Days 11 Days OP CL OP CL OP CL OP CL OP CL OP CL OP CL OP CL GM Infected 1.96 0.71 (2/6) 1.58 0.20 (1/6) NDd(0/3) ND (0/3) ND (0/3) ND (0/3) ND (0/3) ND (0/3) ND (0/ a value of 1.5 was assigned if virus was not detected from the undiluted sample in three embryonated hen's eggs. a value of 1.5 was assigned if virus was not detected from the undiluted sample in three embryonated hen's eggs. c Nave contact ducks housed with those inoculated. pigeons inoculated each pigeon with 106 EID50 of the indicated virus in 200 L via intraocular and intranasal routes. all remaining pigeons were observed clinically for 14 days. pigeons inoculated with the GZ289 virus, or in nave contact with the virus-inoculated pigeons, HI titers were far higher than those observed for the other viruses. pigeons were inoculated with 106 EID50 of the indicated virus in a volume of 200 L via the intraocular and intranasal routes. pigeons that showed clinical signs, such as depression, torticollis, incoordination, and tremors were counted as sick animals. three uninoculated pigeons were co-housed with infected pigeons as a contact group 8 h after inoculation. GM and GZ289 viruses replicated systemically in pigeons. titers are expressed as means standard deviation in log10EID50/g of tissue. in the YF18 virus- inoculated group, the virus titers of the cloacal swabs were detected only at 3 DPI (1.75 log10EID50), however, the virus titers of the cloacal swabs could not be detected during our observation period. the virus was shed from both the oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs in inoculated pigeons within 11 DPI.

PPMV-1 is generally virulent, though upon infecting chickens can result in clinical diseases expected of NDV with low virulence. previous studies have demonstrated that PPMV-1 strains are capable of being transmitted from infected pigeons to chickens and turkeys housed in physical contact. however quails and geese did not exhibit clinical signs or shed the virus. pigeons showed low pathogenicity to chickens and domestic ducks. these results showed that NDVs isolated from different birds exhibit different host ranges and tissue tropisms. however, we do not know the infective dose for each virus for each species. s can prevent NDV outbreaks, yet not stop viral shedding in vaccinated poultry flocks. a correlation exists between antibody response and shedding after infection with virulent NDV in susceptible animals. a correlation exists between antibody response and shedding after infection with virulent NDV in vaccinated birds. s isolated from different birds have varying levels of infectivity, pathogenicity, and transmission in chickens, ducks, and pigeons. authors yK conceived the study and wrote the paper."}
