{"summary": "mice infected with different strains of mouse hepatitis Virus (MHV) provide animal models for human diseases. MHV-JHM and MHV-A59 are commonly used to study viral encephalitis. MHV-A59 also triggers mild to moderate hepatitis. in most cell lines, murine CoVs are poor inducers of type I IFN. in primary cells, however, MHVs trigger IFN- in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) [12] and IFN- in macrophages [7,9] and are sensitive to pre-treatment with IFN- in macrophages [15]. therefore, interaction between murine CoVs and the type I IFN response depends on the cell type. cell surface TLR2 and TLR4 may recognize viral structural components. endosomal TLR3 and TLR7/8 may sense viral double-stranded and single-stranded RNA. TLR2 has been considered until recently a poor inducer of IFN response. simplex virus encephalitis (through TLR3) [28], lethal influenza virus (through TLR3) [29], HIV strains Bal and Jago (through TLR3) [30], and hepatitis C virus (through TLR7) [31]. this study was undertaken to assess the effect of ligand-mediated, TLR activation of macrophages on their susceptibility to infection with murine coronavirus. TLR2 has been shown to recognize MHV-3 in peritoneal macrophages [8]; TLR4 has been implicated in protection and pathogenesis in MHV-1-induced respiratory infection [36] despite the fact that TLR3 is a sensor of dsRNA and could sense CoV replicative forms in infected cells. ve J774A.1 cells were profiled for TLR1-9 gene expression. expression levels of target genes were normalized to the housekeeping gene -actin (Ct) expression levels of target genes were normalized to the housekeeping gene -actin (Ct) expression levels of target genes were normalized to the housekeeping gene 18S rRNA (Ct) gene expression values were calculated based on the Ct method, with data for all samples analyzed against the mean value of four replicates. expression of IFN- and IFN- genes was up regulated by poly I:C, LPS, and R837 ligands in J774A.1 cells. expression of type I IFN- and IFN- genes was up regulated by poly I:C, LPS, and R837 ligands. expression of type I IFN- and IFN-4 mRNAs peaked at 4 h and 6 h post-stimulation. HKLM (TLR2) at 108 cells/mL; LPS (TLR4) at 5 g/mL; Imiquimod (R837) at 5 g/mL; TLR7) at 5 g/mL. role of TLR7 in macrophage activation remains poorly understood. poly I:C triggered a comparable effect on MHV production at all concentrations. cells incubated with the basal medium before and during infection served as a negative control for the effect of TLR triggering on virus production. titers were assessed in cell-free supernatants using a plaque assay on L2 fibroblasts. complete suppression was observed only in poly I:C-treated MHV-JHM- and MHV-3-, infected macrophages. all MHV strains showed a dramatic 3-log reduction in virus production. this could be explained by the ability of MHV-A59 to grow to higher titers (3\u20134 log) than MHV-JHM and MHV-3 in macrophages. the inability of TLR2, TLR4 and TLR7 agonists to protect macrophages from MHV infection stems from the absence of signaling through these receptors. antiviral effect mediated by activation of TLR3 with poly I:C is associated with a sustained transcriptional upregulation and secretion of IFN-4 and IFN-. a single challenge with the TLR3 ligand before or after virus adsorption was sufficient to trigger a robust antiviral effect in MHV-infected macrophages. despite the concentration of poly I:C, the triggering of TLR3 with poly I:C resulted in a 3-log reduction in RA59-GFP titers in prestimulated and coactivated macrophages. RA59-GFP infection was visualized at the original magnification x100. unstimulated but infected macrophages served as a negative control for poly I:C antiviral effect. CM from mock macrophages (unstimulated, uninfected) did not affect virus production. a 2-log reduction in RA59-GFP titers in cells pretreated with poly I:C CM correlated with the inhibition of GFP expression in these cells. cells were infected with RA59-GFP (1 MOI) for 1 h adsorption in the absence of TLR ligands. RA59-GFP titers were assessed in cell-free supernatants using a plaque assay on L2 fibroblasts. errors represent the standard error of the mean of two replicates. these data suggest that prestimulation with poly I:C but not HKLM, LPS, or R837 triggers the production of soluble factors. cells were preimulated for 6 h with HKLM (108 cells/mL), LPS (5 g/mL), R837 (5 g/mL), and poly I:C (0.25 g/mL). cells were left unstimulated and only infected with MHV-A59 or MHV-JHM at 1.0 MOI for 1 h of adsorption in the absence of the ligands. poly I:C-activated J774A.1 macrophages exhibit high levels of IFN- and - as a result of delayed-type IFN gene expression. a single challenge with poly I:C for 6 h induced lower levels of IFN- and IFN-4 that were close to the limit of detection of the ELISA assay. cell-free supernatants were taken at 18 h from TLR-activated alone, infected alone, and TLR-activated and assessed for IFN- and IFN- production using ELISA. MHV-A59 and MHV-JHM infection did not induce type I IFN secretion in macrophages as determined by ELISA. the ability of MHV to counteract poly I:C-induced IFN- is cell type-specific and depends on the mode of delivery of poly I:C into the cell. MHV-A59 has been reported to develop various measures to counteract the type I IFN response in macrophages. cells were preimulated for 6 h with HKLM (108 cells/mL), LPS (5 g/mL), R837 (5 g/mL), and poly I:C (0.25 g/mL); media was removed. cells were not TLR activated and only infected with MHV-A59 or MHV-JHM at 1.0 MOI. we measured proinflammatory cytokines in the same samples as above. IL-6 and TNF- are not responsible for and do not contribute to a poly I:C-triggered antiviral effect in MHV-infected cells. poly I:C-triggered antiviral response in MHV-infected macrophages. soluble factors mediate the poly I:C-triggered antiviral effect. poly I:C potently induces type I IFN before and during virus infection. cells were activated with 0.25 g/mL poly I:C at 500, 1000, 2000 U/mL. supernatants were collected after 6 h, cleared of cell debris. ND, not detected; RA59-GFP titers were assessed in cell-free supernatants from (C) using a plaque assay on L2 fibroblasts. CM from macrophages treated with 2000 U/mL IFN- neutralizing Ab (IFN- Ab CM); (3) activated with 0.25 g/mL of poly I:C (poly I:C CM); and (4) activated macrophages with 0.25 g/mL of poly I:C in the presence of 2000 U/mL anti-IFN- neutralizing Ab (poly I:C + IFN- Ab CM) after stimulation, cells were inf poly I:C analog AmpligenTM (Poly I:Poly C12U) was successfully tested in SARS-CoV animal models. mice were treated with AmpligenTM intraperitoneally (i.p.) 4h before SARS-CoV infection. the virus titers in the lungs were assessed 3 days after virus exposure. macrophages are antigen-presenting cells that express TLRs. they play a pivotal role in the recognition of MHV by macrophages. despite their potential role in the recognition of MHV, its role in their pathogenesis has not yet been established. expression of TLR4 and TLR3 transcripts was analyzed using flow cytometry. expression of TLR2, TLR3, TLR4 and TLR7 proteins was analyzed. expression levels of target genes were normalized to the housekeeping gene -actin. J774A.1 macrophages were stimulated with 108 cells/mL HKLM (TLR2), 1 g/mL poly I:C (TLR3), 5 g/mL LPS (TLR4), or 5 g/mL imiquimod (R837) (TLR7) for 6 h. cell-free supernatants were assessed for the production of IL-6 and TNF-. Activation of cells with a TLR2 ligand (HKLM, 108 cells/mL), a TLR3 agonist (poly I:C, 1 g/mL), a TLR4 ligand (LPS, 5 g/mL), or a TLR7 agonist (imiquimod (R837), 5 g/mL) result indicates that, in J774A.1 macrophages, TLR2-4 and TLR7 are activation of TLR3 but not of TLR2, TLR4 or TLR7 triggered robust production of IFN- following pre-stimulation for 6 h in macrophages. contrasting results suggest that type I IFN response may be regulated differentially on TLR3 stimulation at the post transcriptional level in J774A.1 cells. HKLM (TLR2) at 108 cells/mL; LPS (TLR4) at 5 g/mL; Imiquimod (R837) (TLR7) at 5 g/mL. poly I:C (TLR3) was tested at a range of concentrations (0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 g/mL) multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 by adsorption for 1 h in the absence of the ligands and stimulated again for up to 18 h postinfection (p.i.) poly I:C triggered comparable antiviral effect regardless of its concentration (0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 g/mL; data not shown) the highest rate of cytokine production (IL-6 ELISA) and minimal cytotoxicity (LDH cytotoxicity assay) in J774A.1 macrophages activated with poly I:C at various doses. ligand-mediated TLR stimulation exerts differential effects on MHV production in macrophages with a comparable magnitude of suppression of viral titers. a single challenge with the TLR3 ligand before or after virus adsorption was sufficient to trigger a robust antiviral effect comparable to cells challenged with poly I:C twice. cells challenged with poly I:C once before (Poly I:C +/) or 1 h after MHV adsorption (Poly I:C +/+) also exhibited a significant suppression of virus production comparable to that of prestimulated and coactivated macrophages. a single challenge with poly I:C before virus adsorption is sufficient to trigger a profound antiviral effect in MHV-infected macrophages. unstimulated but infected macrophages served as a negative control for poly I:C antiviral effect. error bars represent the standard error of the mean of two replicates (* p value relative to virus alone; other p values relative to Poly I:C-pre-stimulated cells only, Student\u2019s t test) results indicate 0.25 g/mL of poly I:C is sufficient to trigger a profound TLR3-mediated antiviral effect. we wanted to determine if the TLR3 ligand induced soluble factors that mediated protective immunity against CoV infection. soluble factors in antiviral effect mediated by TLR3 in macrophages. CM was diluted 1:1 with the basal medium to replenish nutrients. cells were infected with RA59-GFP (1 MOI) for 1 h adsorption and incubated in the basal medium for up to 18 h p.i. the protective role of type I IFN against coronavirus infection may be mediated by type I IFN. to investigate the role of type I IFN in the inhibition of murine CoV production in macrophages, we focused on MHV-A59 and MHV-JHM strains. dsorption cells were stimulated with a second challenge of the TLR ligands. non-stimulated, non-infected J774A.1 cells were used as mock control. a single challenge with poly I:C for 6 h induced lower levels of IFN- and IFN-4. cell-free supernatants were preimulated for 6 h with HKLM (108 cells/mL), LPS (5 g/mL), R837 (5 g/mL), and poly I:C (0.25 g/mL); media was removed. cells were not TLR activated and only infected with MHV-A59 or MHV-JHM at 1.0 MOI for 1 h of adsorption. MHV-A59 and MHV-JHM infection did not induce type I IFN secretion in macrophages as determined by ELISA. infection with MHV-A59 but not with MHV-JHM reduced level of IFN- secreted in poly I:C-treated macrophages. poly I:C induced a modest level of secretion of IFN- with 18 h stimulation. TLR2 and TLR4 agonists did not promote type I IFN secretion in J774A.1 macrophages. lack of a strong type I IFN production during TLR2, TLR4 or TLR7 signaling is responsible for uncontrolled MHV production. cells were not TLR activated and only infected with MHV-A59 or MHV-JHM at 1.0 MOI for 1 h of adsorption in the absence of the ligands. cells were taken at 18 h from TLR-activated alone, infected alone, and TLR-activated and infected and assessed for IL-6 and TNF- using ELISA. IL-10 was reported to induce a strong antiviral response against various influenza strains in lung epithelial cells. IL-6 and TNF- are not responsible for and do not contribute to a poly I:C-triggered antiviral effect in MHV-infected macrophages. poly I:C-triggered IFN- was significantly reduced by 500 U/mL to 1000 U/mL of the IFN- neutralizing Ab. it was suppressed in the presence of a higher concentration (2000 U/mL) supernatants were collected after 6 h, cleared of cell debris and assessed with IFN- ELISA. cells pretreated with RA59-GFP (1 MOI) by adsorption for 1 h. incubated in fresh medium for up to 18 h p.i. MHV-A59 infection was significantly restored. poly I:C in macrophages activated with poly I:C in the presence of the IFN- neutralizing polyclonal Ab (poly I:C + IFN- Ab CM) results indicate that IFN- is a crucial mediator in the antiviral response against MHVs elicited by triggering TLR3 with poly I:C in macrophages. type I IFN inducer acts through TLR3 [47] and triggers protection from HIV [48,49], coxsackie virus [50], Punta Toro virus [47], Punta Toro virus [51], and influenza virus [52] infections. cells were incubated in humidified atmosphere at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2. cells were infected with 10-fold dilutions of samples in DMEM supplemented with 2% v/v hiFBS. after virus adsorption, cells were overlaid with a 1:1 mixture of 1.4% agarose and 2% FBS in DMEM. cells were incubated for 48 h at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2.

RNA isolation and Real-TimePCR Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol\u00ae reagent (Invitrogen), using a total reaction mix volume of 20 L. cDNA was combined with 12.5 L of TaqMan Universal Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), 10 L diethyl polycarbonate (DEPC)-treated water. DNA was amplified using the Applied Biosystems 7300 real-time PCR machine. antibodies, isotype controls, and anti-FcrR (for blocking) were purchased from Invivogen, Imgenex and eBioscience. cells were incubated with 300 nM DAPI (4',6'-diamidino-2-phenylindole dilactate; Invitrogen, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA) for nuclei stain for 3 min at RT. TLR3 induces a strong type I IFN-dependent antiviral response. Neutralization of IFN- successfully restored poly I:C-inhibited production of MHV-A59 in macrophages."}
