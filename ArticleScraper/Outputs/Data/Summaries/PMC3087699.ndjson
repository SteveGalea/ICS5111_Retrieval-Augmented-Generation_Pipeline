{"summary": "background hepatitis A virus is the causative agent of type A viral hepatitis, which causes occasional acute hepatitis. but little information about synonymous codon usage pattern of HAV genome in the process of its evolution is available. the genetic code chooses 64 codons to represent 20 standard amino acids and stop signals. these alternative codons for the same amino acid are termed synonymous codons. some reports indicate that synonymous codons are not chosen equally within and between genomes. the (C3+G3)% in complete coding region of each HAV genome fluctuated from 28.8 to 31.5. the effective number of codons (ENC) values of these HAV genomes fluctuated from 38.8 to 40.7. most preferentially used codons in HAV are A-ended or U-ended codons except the Gln and Leu whose optimized codons are CAG and UUG ending by G. aENC is effective number of codons Table 2.

COA detected one major trend in the first axis ('1) which accounted for 26.98% of the total variation, and another major trend in the second axis ('2) which accounted for 19.50% of the total variation. each HAV complete coding region was divided by geographical area. there was a complex correlation existing in nucleotide compositions. A3%, C3% and G3% have a negative correlation with C%, U% and A% respectively. compositional constraint is a factor shaping the pattern of synonymous codon usage in HAV genome.

HAV mutation rate is much lower than other members of the family Picornaviridae. this could be ascribed to the distinct endemicity of HAV. it is well known that quasispecies dynamics is characterized by continuous generation of variant viral genomes and competition among them. the 21 available complete RNA sequences of HAV were obtained from GenBank randomly in October 2010. the serial number, GenBank number, genotype and other detail information are listed in Table 5.
