{"summary": "influenza A virus (IAV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are two respiratory pathogens that belong to independent viral families yet can cause similar acute lung disease. the emergence of a novel IAV, the avian H7N9 virus, and of a novel human CoV, has raised pandemic concerns. several studies have identified lncRNAs as major players in the host-response to pathogens. differential expression of lncRNA is observed in response to viral infection11 and in immune cells after stimulation or differentiation. lncRNAs function through their secondary structure rather than through their primary sequence. there are currently no computational methods to reliably predict a single secondary structure for a single sequence of long RNA,18 which could in turn be used to predict lncRNA function. 5,295 lncRNAs predicted to be IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in the context of respiratory disease were functionally annotated using module-based and rank-based enrichment methods. lncRNA annotation will accelerate mechanistic characterization of lncRNA functions that are of general interest to the infectious disease and immunology fields. CC founders supported PR8 and MA15 viral replication to different levels. lncRNA expression levels differed infection conditions and coding gene expression. lncRNA basal levels may be more strain specific than coding gene expression. lncRNA expression levels were more downregulated after infection. a large number of genes were DE after either MA15 or PR8 infection. similarities in lncRNA (A) or coding gene (B) expression profiles are depicted using non-parametric multidimensional scaling (MDS) each RNA sample is represented as a single point colored by viral treatment (green for mock-, salmon for MA15- and blue for PR8-infected samples), and with a different shape according to mouse strain. 62% of DE lncRNAs were negatively correlated with viral replication. only 42% of coding genes were positively correlated with viral replication. lncRNAs were on average slightly less expressed than the coding genes. a complete weighted network was inferred and 11 modules comprised of tightly co-expressed coding and non-coding genes were detected. each module included 95% of coding genes or 94% of lncRNAs. the other modules included both coding genes and lncRNAs strongly co-expressed. module-based annotation provides a first level of annotation for lncRNAs and identifies lncRNAs with a central position in each module. we performed a functional enrichment analysis using several gene-sets from seven categories. the rationale for using Immgen and GeneAtlas gene-sets is that immune cells infiltrating the lungs contribute to respiratory virus pathogenesis. turquoise module was the most highly correlated module with viral replication following either MA15 or PR8 infection. the turquoise module was also the most highly correlated module with viral replication following either MA15 or PR8 infection. 0042113_B cell activation (ES = 2.56) GPCR downstream signaling (ES = 2.78) Bcells common (ES = 7.81) #33: \u201cEarly B module\u201d (ES = 4.61) Otx1_2325.1(UP00229_1) (ES = 3.91) SARS_WL (0.37) magenta GO:0042254_ribosome biogenesis (ES = 8.45) Gene Expression (ES = 24.61) Mast cells ( 65_signal transduction (ES = 4.75) Immune System (ES = 25.77) T-cells foxP3+ (ES = 2.47) #25: \u201cLow in T cells, intermediate in B cells, high in myeloids\u201d (ES = 3.46) Klf4(MA0039.2) (ES = 11.09) ISG (ES = 2.77) QTL_FLU_HrI4 (ES = 1.53) SARS_WL (-0.67); module functional enrichment allowed us to describe the global host-response network to either PR8 or MA15 infection. this also provided a primary level of annotation for lncRNAs belonging to each module. coding genes were more likely to be key points (hubs or bottlenecks) of the network. functional enrichment was performed with the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum (WRS) test. gene-sets were defined as genes highly expressed in immune cells compared with lung profiles in GeneAtlas. the results of this annotation can be retrieved in www.monocldb.org. it is possible to know which lncRNA was most highly enriched in any given gene-set. about 1,000 lncRNAs were not significantly associated with any GO biological process (BP) or any Reactome pathway. cis-regulatory lncRNAs were mostly positively correlated with coding-gene neighbors. a large number of lncRNAs (1864; 35%) were classified as potential cis enhancer-like while only 152 lncRNAs (3%) were classified as potential cis enhancer-like. enhancer-like lncRNAs were mostly on the same strand as positively correlated neighbors. most of the trans-acting lncRNAs had only one DE coding gene neighbor. most of the trans-acting lncRNAs had no DE coding gene neighbors. in constrast to lncRNAs, there was no coding gene negatively correlated with all of its neighbor genes or with sense neighbor genes. most of the cis enhancer-like coding genes had one coding gene neighbor while most of the trans coding genes had two or three coding gene neighbors (sense and both strands, respectively) lncRNAs that were upregulated after IFN treatment were significantly enriched in the top of the list of predicted IFN-stimulated lncRNAs. other predicted IFN-stimulated lncRNAs that were not found DE in the lungs of IFN-treated mice were mostly upregulated. lncRNAs that were found DE in an additional RNA-Seq data set of mice treated with IFN- are displayed with black lines. top ranked lncRNA were highly and significantly upregulated in mice treated with IFN. users can select lncRNAs by: noncode ID (e.g., \u201cn424068\u201d), GO term found significantly enriched with the rank-based annotation (e.g., \u201cGO:0007010\u201d), Ensembl gene ID of most correlated coding-genes (e.g., \u201cENSMUSG00000029088\u201d). for simplification, we have replaced the MONOCLdb lncRNA gene names by their symbol. the size of each bubble is relative to the absolute bicor coefficient. the position of each lncRNA in the chromosomic circle is relative to its coordinate. lncRNA classified as potential cis lncRNA are represented in blue while trans lncRNA are in purple. CC founder strains have a wide range of susceptibility to PR8 and MA15 infection. eight different strains of mice were infected intranasally with sublethal doses of highly pathogenic mouse-adapted IAV (PR8) or SARS-CoV (MA15) and the lungs used for transcriptome sequencing. s most susceptible to MA15 were PWK/PhJ and CAST/EiJ. but these strains had intermediate to low susceptibility to PR8 infection. viral replication was not significantly correlated with weight loss after either MA15 or PR8 infection. the dynamic range of lncRNA expression following either MA15 or PR8 infection was as large as the coding gene expression range. the dynamic range of lncRNA expression following either MA15 or PR8 infection was as large as the coding gene expression range. lncRNA expression levels were more downregulated while coding gene expression levels were more upregulated after infection. lncRNAs accounted for about 40% of the total number of DE genes. lncRNAs accounted for about 40% of the total number of DE genes. many DE coding and non-coding genes were negatively correlated with viral replication. lncRNAs are tightly co-expressed with DE coding genes. a higher number of mixed pairs of coding and non-coding genes were negatively correlated. the brown and salmon modules included 95% of coding genes or 94% of lncRNAs. the other modules included both coding genes and lncRNAs that were strongly co-expressed. gene-sets from seven categories are universally used in biology. the rationale for using Immgen and GeneAtlas gene-sets is that immune cells infiltrating the lungs contribute to respiratory virus pathogenesis. the turquoise module was the largest upregulated module with 1,331 lncRNAs and 1,664 coding genes.

Immgen Coarse module number found significantly enriched with the rank-based annotation (e.g., \u201cImmgen_Coarse.module_28\u201d), Ensembl gene ID of most correlated coding-genes (e.g., \u201cENSMUSG00000029088\u201d), or Ensembl gene ID of chromosomic neighbor (within 200 kb) coding-genes. the position of each lncRNA in the chromosomic circle is relative to its coordinate (middle of the gene). lncRNA classified as potential cis lncRNA are represented in blue while trans lncRNA are in purple. a distributed annotation system (DAS) service is also available for visualization of lncRNA annotations. 5,295 lncRNAs were characterized by at least one gene set. this greatly expands the work of Liao et al., who used similar methods to characterize the lncRNAs present on the Affymetrix Mouse 430 2.0 array. 57% of DE lncRNAs vs. 40% of DE coding genes belonged to modules mostly downregulated after infection (black, green, pink and purple modules) the four downregulated modules were enriched in genes associated with metabolism, development, transport processes and the cytoskeleton. malat1 is an abundant nuclear lncRNA localized in nuclear speckles. it is described as a regulator of gene expression governing hallmarks of lung cancer metastasis. malat1 depletion results in the activation of p53 and its target genes27. downregulation during infection could therefore activate the p53 pathway. n265692 has a motif for ISGF3G (aka IRF9) in its promoter. rank-based enrichment revealed a significant co-regulation with genes also having a binding motif for IRF9. 177 other lncRNAs were co-regulated with genes sharing IRF3, IRF4, IRF5 and/or IRF9 binding motifs. Adapt33 (n424043-n424044) was slightly upregulated in PR8-infected WSB/EiJ mice. this transcript was negatively correlated with both IAV and SARS-CoV replication. Adapt33 was previously described as a stress-inducible riboregulator. n268833 (AK142945) belongs to the QTL HrI2 (Host response to Influenza) this lncNRA was significantly upregulated after PR8 infection in all CC mice except CAST/EiJ, NZO/HILt and PWK/PhJ. expression of n268833 was highly correlated with PR8 replication, belonged to the turquoise module, and positively correlated with IL-18. we generated a large RNA-Seq data set, with gene-expression profiles from 120 CC founder mice. this represents a valuable resource for mouse genomic studies and for the Collaborative Cross. characterization of lncRNAs predicted to belong to the IFN response would have broad impact for immunology and infectious disease fields. mock infected animals received 50 L of PBS. animals were euthanized via isoflurane overdose. lungs were harvested and used for total RNA-Seq and viral titration. RNA extraction Total RNA was extracted from MEF cell lysates and lung tissue homogenates using the miRNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) RNA sample concentrations were quantified on an ND-2000c UVVis spectophotometer (Nanodrop, Wilmington, DE) and controlled for integrity and purity on a capillary electrophoresis system. Whole transcriptome libraries were constructed using TruSeq Stranded Total RNA with Ribo-Zero ncRNA sequences and lncRNAs annotated in a number of well-known databases before 2012. out of the 37,049 mouse non-coding sequences, we selected 36,073 non-coding sequences that included the term \u2018lncRNA\u2019 in their type. 209 lncRNA sequences were added from Gutmann et al. the best alignment per query (transcript sequence) was kept. alignments for which less than 80% of the query sequence was aligned were filtered out. overlapping introns, and those introns 4 bp were removed using gffread. the insert window for paired-end reads was set between 20 and 500 nt. 40,566 genes, including 19,838 coding and 20,728 non-coding genes, were quantified with at least one read count across the experiment. five samples from infected mice with very low viral read counts were excluded from the differential expression analysis. in total, 8,270 coding genes and 5,329 non-coding genes were determined to be DE in at least one infection condition. BP gene-sets were retrieved from the reactome website. co-expressed modules of genes in immune cells were downloaded from the reactome website. genes highly expressed in immune cells compared with lung were defined as genes expressed 20-fold more in each immune cell subset. size was set to 150 genes determined as the number giving highest enrichment scores in GO BP. association between each module and phenotypic data was calculated by computing the biweight midcorrelation between phenotypic data and each module representative expression profile (module eigengene) each module was characterized functionally by calculating enrichment scores in each of the gene-sets described above as \u2013log10(p-value) lncRNAs with no significantly correlated neighboring gene were classified as potential trans lncRNAs. a given lncRNA was defined as cis enhancer-like if it was found positively correlated with all its coding neighbors. p-values were used for inhibitor cis lncRNA to assess negative correlation with coding genes. different visualization interfaces of MONOCLdb, as well as the automatically querying web-service, were created using a collection of PHP, SQL, R, and JavaScript scripts. RNA-seq based characterization of long non-coding RNA involved in respiratory viruses pathogenesis contains 12 total RNA-Seq samples from the eight CC founders mice treated with either IFN- or IFN-. animals eight-to-16-wk-old female animals from the eight CC founder strains (A/J, C57BL/6J, 129S1/SvImJ, NOD/ShiLtJ, NZO/HILt, C infections Animals were anesthetized via inhalation of isoflurane (Piramal, Bethlehem, Pa) and infected intranasally with 5 102 pfu of PR8 or 104 PFU of MA15 in 50 L of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) animals were scored daily for morbidity (determined as percent weight loss), mortality and clinical disease. four IFN-treated mice and 3 EF-PBS treated mice were euthanized at 12 h post-treatment. RNA extraction Total RNA was extracted from MEF cell lysates and lung tissue homogenates using the miRNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) Whole transcriptome libraries were constructed using TruSeq Stranded Total RNA with Ribo-Zero Gold. lncRNA annotation We downloaded the non-coding annotation from the NONCODEv3 database. out of 37,049 mouse non-coding sequences, we selected 36,073 non-coding sequences that included the term \u2018lncRNA\u2019 in their type. acy of gene quantification following this pipeline was checked for three C57BL/6J samples. we compared gene counts after alignment to the C57BL/6J transcriptome and gene counts quantified after alignment to the Mus musculus reference genome. the eight CC founder strain genomes were downloaded from the UNC Systems Genetics website (version 2012\u201311\u201308) reads that mapped directly with no gaps to MM9 ribosome sequence were filtered out using Picard tools (picard.sourceforge.net) read alignments against PR8 and MA15 viral sequences were described in Supplemental methods. individual log2 fold change (FC) were calculated after offsetting normalized data by 1 and by subtracting individual log2 values by the mean of log2 expression values from mouse strain-matched mock samples. samples from each mouse strain infected with MA15 or PR8 at each DPI were compared with the pool of strain-matched mice. central genes of networks that are heavily connected nodes, or hubs, were determined by calculating weighted degree for each gene considering the whole network (kTotal) or only genes belonging to the same module (kWithin) gene-sets were retrieved from reactome website. genes highly expressed in immune cells compared with lung were defined as genes expressed 20-fold more in each immune cell subset than in lung. module definition was performed using the dynamicTreeCut R package42. the minimal module size was set to 150 genes determined as the number giving highest module enrichment scores in GO BP. each module was characterized functionally by calculating enrichment scores in each gene-set. positive signed correlation outperformed unsigned correlation to associate genes with similar functions. adjusted p-value 0.05 were considered as significant. lncRNAs with no significantly correlated neighboring gene or with similar functions. both positively and negatively correlated neighbors were classified as potential trans lncRNAs. up distinct-directional p-values were used for enhancer-like cis lncRNA to assess specific positive correlation with coding genes. down distinct-directional p-values were used for inhibitor cis lncRNA to assess specific negative correlation with coding genes. sion number NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), GSE52405, GSE55480, and GSE53057 contain 123 total RNA-Seq samples from the eight CC founders mice infected with PR8, MA15 or mock-infected."}
