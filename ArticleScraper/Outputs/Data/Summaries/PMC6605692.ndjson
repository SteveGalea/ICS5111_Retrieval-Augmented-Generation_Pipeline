{"summary": "Legionnaires' disease is a relatively rare cause of community-acquired pneumonia caused by Legionella species. 20%-25% of patients who are hospitalized with Legionnaires' disease require invasive mechanical ventilation. average mortality rates for sporadic disease range from 10% to 15%. due to graft versus host disease, he was receiving prednisone at a maintenance dose of 15 mg daily for several years. he had multiple documented allergies to penicillin, sulfa drugs, macrolides and fluoroquinolones, with reported reactions including rash, hives, and anaphylaxis. he was in acute respiratory distress and had decreased breath sounds and crackles bilaterally. a nasopharyngeal sample was collected for respiratory virus PCR testing for influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus A and B, coronavirus, parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, enterovirus, adenovirus, bocavirus, and metapneumovirus. he was empirically started on meropenem, vancomycin, oseltamivir, and intravenous pentamidine. intravenous doxycycline is not readily available in our institution. he was treated with intravenous tigecycline with an initial dose of 100 mg, followed by 50 mg twice daily for a total of 14 days of therapy. there was no recurrence of infection after three months of follow-up. urine antigen testing for Legionella only detects Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 (Lp1) and is most sensitive for the detection of the Pontiac subtype of Lp1. molecular testing of lower respiratory tract specimens can also be used to identify both Legionella pneumophila and Legionella species by PCR. all but one of these eight patients received combination therapy with tigecycline. levofloxacin or azithromycin was added as part of their treatment regimen. it is difficult to ascertain whether clinical improvement in these cases was due to the addition of tigecycline or post-antibiotic effect. tigecycline is a rare cause of community-acquired pneumonia but can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. this case report provides evidence supporting the use of tigecycline as a second-line therapeutic option."}
