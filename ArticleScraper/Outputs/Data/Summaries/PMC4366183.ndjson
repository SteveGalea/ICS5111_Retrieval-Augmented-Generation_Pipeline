{"summary": "PED is a highly contagious, acute enteric viral disease of swine. it is characterized by vomiting, watery diarrhea, and dehydration. outbreaks of PED with increased severity of diarrhea, vomiting and dehydration have occurred in china since 2010. PEDV is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus with large nested-set arrangement of the subgenomic mRNAs (sgmRNA) the genome of PEDV is approximately 28 kb nucleotides (nt) in length, containing 5 untranslated region (UTR), 3 UTR with a polyadenylated tail and at least seven open reading frames (ORFs) a total of 125 fecal and intestinal samples from neonatal piglets were collected. of which, 96 were detected to be positive for PEDV. the complete genome of two representative intestinal specimens from 96 PEDV positive samples identified were sequenced and analyzed. ninety-six out of 125 samples tested positive for PEDV. all samples had been confirmed to be free of TGEV, PoRV and other common enteric pathogens. two representative PEDV strains, designated CH/JX-1/2013 and CH/JX-2/2013, were used for sequencing the full-length genome. PCR products obtained were subjected to gel purification using a gel extraction kit (TaKaRa, Japan) and then cloned into pMD 18-T vectors (TaKaRa, Japan) five positive clones of each amplicon were submitted to a commercial sequencing company (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China) primary sequences of 5 -proximal region of 5 -UTRs (nt 42 to 133) were pairwise compared between the two Jiangxi strains. antigenicity and hydrophilicity analyses based on the aa sequence from 1 to 350 at N-terminal of the S proteins were carried out by Protean software of DNAStar Lasergene V7.10.

Phylogenetic trees based on the complete genome, aa sequences of structural proteins and ORF3 of PEDV strains. the trees were constructed by the distance-based neighbor-joining algorithm using MEGA 5.2.2 software. the full-length of S gene of CH/JX-1/2013 and CH/JX-2/2013 was 4,161 nt in size. the results from nucleotide sequence comparisons of the S gene of 34 strains of PEDV, including CH/JX-1/2013, CH/JX-2/2013 and other 32 reference PEDV strains from China, United States, UK, south Korea, Belgium, France and Japan. analysis based on aa from positioned 1 to 350 of the S protein suggested that the antigenicity and hydrophilicity of S protein of CH/JX-1/2013, CH/JX-2/2013 might have already changed due to the mutated amino acids with changes of charges and polarities. a Strain CH/ZMDZY/11 is R at residue 89 b Isolate CH/S is A at residue 1049. Strain CH/FJND-3/2011 is S at residue 1049 d Strain CH/FJND-3/2011 is G at residue 1178. antigenic and hydrophilic analyses of amino acid sequences of partial S protein of nine PEDV strains. a hexameric motif sequence of CTAGAC was observed in CH/JX-1/2013 and CH/JX-2/2013. a few nucleotide changes were found in both CH/JX-1/2013 and CH/JX-2/2013, and of which eight led to the aa changes. the phylogenetic tree based on the deduced aa sequences of the ORF3 of the earlier European strains, CV777, Korean strains, nucleotide change amino acid change Position in ORF3 gene CV777 CH/JX-1 /2013 CH/JX-2 /2013 Position in ORF3 protein CV777 CH/JX-1 /2013 CH/JX-2 /2013 54 G A 62 T C C 63 C T T 21 V A 160 G A 162 T C C 54 V L L 235 G A 237 C T T 79 V L L 238 T G G 80 F V V V 243 C T the entire N gene of CH/JX-1/2013 and CH/JX-2/2013 was 1,326 nt long, encoding a protein of 441-aa. the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the N protein were highly conserved. phylogenetic topology of N protein was similar to that of ORF3. five aa substitutions at residue 84 (G84A), 205 (N205K, from neutral charge N to positive K), 381(L381P), 395 (L395Q, from hydrophobic L to hydrophobic N) and 398 (H398N, from hydrophilic H to hydrophobic N) existed in subgroup 2a when compared with other three subgroups the third nucleotide in loop 4 of recently determined strains of CH/JX-1/2013, CH/JX-2/2013, GD-B, JS-HZ/2012, Co/13, CH/FJZZ-9/2012, and GD-1 was a C, rather than a U at the same position in other four PEDV strains isolated earlier. however this deletion would not impact the secondary structure of the SL4 as demonstrated by an analysis. a total of 27 nt differences were identified when compared to the whole genome of CH/JX-1/2013 and CH/JX-2/2013. the nucleotide identity between the Jiangxi PEDV strains and strains identified post-2010 ranged from 97.3\u201399.7%. the nucleotide identity with those determined ante-2010 ranged from 96.3\u201397.0%. two of the nucleotide substitutions led to aa changes along with the charge variations. most of them were located in ORF1a, ORF1b and S gene. phylogenetic tree based on full-length genome sequence of CH/JX-1/2013, CH/JX-2/2013 and 30 reference PEDVs indicated that the PEDV strains could be divided into two groups, designated for group1 (G1) and group 2 (G2). all the strains identified from 2011 to 2013 were fallen into G2. deletions, 20842A, 21097CGTGAT21102, existed in the N-terminal domain (NTD of the S protein in G 2 members; 2) the three field PEDV strains of JS2008, JS2008new and SD-M together with two attenuated PEDV strains, DR13 and vaccine_KC189944 were clustered into subgroup 1b. phylogenetic tree generated on the basis of nucleotide sequences of the complete genome of 33 PEDVs. 1B to 1F: Phylogenetic trees based on deduced amino acid sequences of S glycoprotein genes, ORF3, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid genes. results from nucleotide sequence comparisons of the S gene of 34 strains of PEDV. both CH/JX-1/2013 and CH/JX-2/2013 belonged to subgroup 2b. compared to G1, there were two insertions (61VNST64 and 136N) and one deletion (155DG156) antigenic and hydrophilic analyses of the amino acid sequences of partial S protein of nine PEDV strains. arrows indicate the discrepancy of antigenic and hydrophilic plots between group 1 and group 2. the ORF3 of both CH/JX-1/2013 and CH/JX-2/2013 was 675 nt in length, encoding a protein of 224 aa. both CH/JX-1/2013 and CH/JX-2/2013 shared 91.6\u201399.7% aa identity with other PEDV strains used in this study. DR13, SM98, SD-M and LZC shared 6-aa substitutions, at residues 21 (V21A), 54 (V54I), 79 (V79I), 92 (L92F), 101 (A101T, from hydrophobic polarity A to hydrophilic polarity T) in the ORF3 protein. the phylogenetic tree constructed based on the deduced aa sequences of the selected reference PEDV strains showed that all the sequences could be classified into two groups, that is, Group 1 and Group 2. the entire N gene of CH/JX-1/2013 and CH/JX-2/2013 had an ORF of 681 nt, encoding a 226-aa protein. the aa homology between CH/JX-1/2013 and CH/JX-2/2013 and other PEDV strains used in this study varied from 95\u201398.9%. the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of N protein were highly conserved and neither insertion nor deletion was found. core sequence (CUAAAC) of the PEDV leader transcription-regulating sequence (TRS) was extremely conserved with no nucleotide substitutions in all the PEDV strains except the strains of CV777 and LZC. a \u2018U\u2019 insertion in loop 2 was found in both CH/JX-1/2013 and CH/JX-2/2013 and other six PEDV strains. the core sequences (CUAAAC) of leader transcription-regulating sequences (CS-L) are highlighted in gray, nucleotide insertions are highlighted in red, and mutations are highlighted in blue. an \u2018A\u2019 deletion is seen in both CH/JX-1/2013 and CH/JX-2/2013 identified in this study and other strains excluding CV777 and LZC. field PEDV strains, JS2008, JS2008new and SD-M together with two attenuated PEDV strains, DR13 and vaccine_KC189944, were clustered into an independent cluster. these unique characteristics suggested that the three field PEDV strains might derive from the same source. a recombination event might have occurred between these three viruses and the two vaccine strains in the same subgroup. the \u2018U\u2019 insertion in SL2 does not alter the RNA secondary structure. the core sequence (5 -CUAAAC-3 ) in TRS of PEDV has reported to be a determinant factor in transcriptional regulation in coronavirus. PEDV is known to play pivotal roles in viral entry and inducing the neutralizing antibodies in natural hosts. there were significant genetic variations in the S gene between the newly determined PEDV field strains and early isolates. a reduced cell-culture-adapted PEDV strain (attenuated DR13, passage 100) has a truncated ORF3 of a 51-nt deletion. this gene may be involved in cell tropism and is essential for the virulence of PEDVs. aa sequences revealed that two Jiangxi strains CH/JX-1/2013 and CH/JX-2/2013 had a close relationship with the recent prevailing field PEDV strains in china and the united states. differences at the level of the nucleotides and deduced aa between the present field PEDV strains and CV777 might have conferred the less effectiveness of the vaccines currently widely being used in China."}
