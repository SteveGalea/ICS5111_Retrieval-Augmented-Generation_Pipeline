{"summary": "the nucleoside analog GS-441524 for cats suffering from various forms of naturally acquired feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) the group was started on GS-441524 at a dosage of 2.0 mg/kg SC q24h for at least 12 weeks. four of the 31 cats that presented with severe disease died or were euthanized within 2\u20135 days and a fifth after 26 days. optimum dosage was found to be 4.0 mg/kg SC q24h for at least 12 weeks. interest in antiviral drugs for infections of animals has been much slower to develop. emergence of exotic diseases such as Ebola, Middle East respiratory syndrome and severe acute respiratory syndrome in people has prompted research into drugs that will inhibit RNA virus replication. GS-441524 and GS-5734 were found to have comparable EC50 (1.0 M) and CC50 (>100 M) values against FIPV in cat cells. a pharmacokinetic study in two laboratory cats demonstrated sustained and effective plasma levels of GS-441524 over 24 h following a single dose given subcutaneously (SC) or intravenously (IV). study was conducted under protocols 19336 and 19863 approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and the Clinical Trial Review Board of the VMTH Clinical Trials Committee, University of California (UC), Davis. a placebo treatment group was not included, given that preparatory in vitro and in vivo studies indicated that GS-441524 would be safe and more effective than no treatment. 16 Cats with signs of non-effusive FIP were further tested by abdominal and thoracic ultrasonography for primary lesions. neurological status in cases with possible central nervous system disease signs was evaluated by VMTH neurology service. fusive CT65 Mona 14 Mar 2016 Exotic SH/Persian F Breeder 11 Jun 2017 Thoracic effusive CT66 Squeekers 7 Jun 2016 DSH FS Shelter 14 Jun 2017 abdominal effusive CT67 Double 2 Mar 2016 Ragdoll FS Breeder 20 Jun 2017 abdominal effusive CT68 Tuckerman 8 May 2017 abdominal effusive CT69 Danny 16 Jun 2015 Snowshoe MC Shelter 22 Jun 2017 abdominal effusive CT70 Tols initial dosage regimen for GS-441524 was 2.0 mg/kg SC q24h. 6 treatment was extended one or more weeks in cats that still had abnormal serum protein values. owners sent a new supply of drug every 4 weeks in form of preloaded 1 or 3 ml Luer lock syringes. a CBC and serum chemistry panel were done at monthly intervals by local veterinarians or during visits to the VMTH. a diluted drug was refrigerated and used within 3\u20134 weeks. owner's request for the final disposition of the body was honored. study did not incorporate a control group because there is no effective treatment to compare it against. a placebo treatment group was not included, given that preparatory in vitro and in vivo studies indicated that GS-441524 would be safe and more effective than no treatment. list of 31 cats enrolled in trial included laboratory designation, name given by owner, breed, clinical form of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) and date of diagnosis Cat ID Name Date of birth Breed Sex Origin Date of diagnosis FIP form CT52 Luna 9 Jan 2017 Savannah F Breeder 24 Apr 2017 Abdominal effusive CT53 Ice Bear 2 Aug 2016 Siberian F Breeder 15 Apr 2017 Abdominal effusive CT55 Dempsey 26 Jun 2016 DSH MC Rescue 15 Apr 2017 doll FS Breeder 20 Jun 2017 Abdominal effusive CT68 Tuckerman 8 May 2016 Maine Coon MC Rescue 22 Jun 2017 Abdominal effusive CT69 Danny 16 Jun 2015 Snowshoe MC Shelter 22 Jun 2017 Thoracic effusive CT70 Tolstoy 1 Aug 2014 DSH MC Rescue 25 Jun 2017 Abdominal effusive CT71 Amadeus 29 Jun 2016 DSH MC Stray 20 Jun 2017 Thoracic effusive CT72 Bella 25 Feb 2017 British SH the minimum treatment period was 12 weeks based on experiences with the 3CL protease inhibitor GC376 against naturally occurring FIP. the dosage was increased during later stages of the trial from 2.0 to 4.0 mg/kg in cases where treatment had to be extended or when disease relapses occurred. a CBC and serum chemistry panel were done at monthly intervals by local veterinarians or during visits to the VMTH. a CBC and serum chemistry panel were done at monthly intervals by local veterinarians or during visits to the VMTH. any abnormal signs or behaviors were to be noted and promptly reported. four cats were euthanized (CT62, CT72, CT75) or died (CT56) within the first 2\u20135 days because of severe disease and other complications. a fifth cat was euthanized (CT54) after 26 days owing to a lack of treatment response. cats with thoracic effusions were usually dyspneic upon presentation to private veterinarians. jaundice slowly resolved over 2\u20134 weeks, in parallel with decreasing hyperbilirubinemia. signs of ocular disease began to clear within 24\u201348 h. only one cat (CT60) had an obvious abdominal effusion upon relapse. a decision was made to increase the dose of GS-441524 from 2.0 to 4.0 mg/kg in eight of the cats. in total, 25/26 cats treated for 12 weeks or longer achieved a sustained remission of FIP. one of them subsequently died of an unrelated heart problem. CBCs Cats presented with elevated white blood cell counts, which dropped to normal levels within the first 2 weeks of treatment. a mild to moderately severe anemia was observed at the time of treatment and resolved over the first week of treatment. serum albumin levels and standard error for 26 cats completed at least 12 weeks of treatment. globulin levels rose during the first 3 weeks of treatment, peaked, and slowly dropped to a maximum reference value of 4.5 g/dl or lower by week 9. levels of albumin in serum of the 26 cats treated for at least 12 weeks were usually low (3.2 g/dl) only one cat (CT54) failed to show a significant drop in viral RNA levels over a 9 day period. sixteen of 26 treated cats manifested injection site reactions. only three cats had noticeable scars at injection sites. GS-441524 treatment over a total period of 12\u201330 weeks was remarkably safe. four cats (CT56, CT62, CT72, CT75) were euthanized or died within 2\u20135 days of enrollment. a fifth cat (cat CT54) was euthanized after 26 days of treatment. all five cats presented with severe abdominal effusive disease. cat CT57 was normal after one round of treatment but relapsed 2 weeks later. cat failed to respond to retreatment and was euthanized. lesions typical of FIP were found within the brain and abdomen. twenty-six of the 31 cats presented with effusive FIP (six thoracic, 20 abdominal) five cats presented with non-effusive FIP; four of them (CT59, CT64, CT73, CT78) with disease localized to the abdomen (mesenteric and ileo/cecal/colic lymph nodes) and one to the chest (lung, hilar lymph nodes) the treatment end date for the 26 cats that completed at least 12 weeks of treatment is given in parenthesis. the clinical response of the 26 cats that completed at least 12 weeks of treatment was dramatic. thoracic effusions rapidly disappeared over a 1\u20132 week period starting around 10\u201314 days post-treatment. disease relapses in 2/8 cats (CT57, CT71) were clearly of a neurological nature with high fever and severe posterior ataxia and incoordination. only one cat (CT60) had an obvious abdominal effusion upon relapse. a decision was made to increase the dose of GS-441524 from 2.0 to 4.0 mg/kg in eight of the cats. owners were advised to avoid unnecessary stresses on their cats for the first 3 months. four cats (CT52, CT58, CT65, CT79) were spayed and one cat castrated without complications. weight gains of 20\u2013120% occurred during and following treatment. abnormal serum protein values improved progressively and reached normal levels after 8\u201310 weeks of treatment. level of total protein was the least informative, as indicated by weak R2 value (0.1883) for the trend line. however, a dramatic and transient rise in total protein levels occurred 3 weeks into treatment. levels of viral RNA decreased by 2\u20135 days in 7/8 cats. only one cat (CT54) failed to show a significant drop in viral RNA levels over a 9 day period. UND = undetectable Side effects observed during and after treatment. initial reactions were manifested by vocalization, occasional growling and postural changes lasting for 30\u201360 s. sixteen of 26 treated cats manifested injection site reactions. cat CT53 had a progressive rise in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) to 35 mg/dl. sudden rise in SDMA (20 g/dl) (RI 0\u201314 g/dl) at 8 weeks into a third round of treatment with the higher 4 mg/kg dosage regimen. the cat is currently in disease remission. some reactions left small permanent scars Systemic drug reactions GS-441524 treatment over a total period of 12\u201330 weeks was remarkably safe. tests for liver and kidney function and levels of amylase/lipase remained normal during and after treatment. cat CT53 had a progressive rise in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) to 35 mg/dl (reference interval [RI] 16\u201337 g/dl) and sudden rise in SDMA (20 g/dl) cat CT62 had severe pyogranulomatous vasculitis restricted to the abdomen with moderate-to-severe peripheral edema and mineralization of the adrenal cortices. cat CT75 presented with a chronic form of FIP characterized by severe stunting of growth, a massive low protein/low cell abdominal effusion, gallop rhythm indicative of impaired cardiac function. the microscopic appearance of the left cardiac ventricular wall was typical of congenital feline hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) no gross or microscopic lesions of FIP were found in the abdomen, chest, eyes, brain or spine. relapses with GC376, even with increased dosage, were no longer treatable. both drugs appear to be quite safe, although GC376 interfered with the development of permanent teeth when given to younger kittens. resistance to GS-5734 (Remdesivir), a prodrug of GS-441524, has been associated with amino acid mutations in RNA polymerase and proofreading exonuclease in tissue culture propagated coronaviruses. resistance to GS-5734 (Remdesivir), a prodrug of GS-441524, has been seen in one cat in the current trial. anemia of chronic disease affects 18\u201395% of people with acute and chronic infections and is normocytic/normochromic and not associated with iron deficiency. plasma albumin levels were also a good measure of disease activity. one cat (CT53) had a mild rise in BUN and SDMA 8 weeks into a third round of treatment and prompting a halt as a precautionary measure. three cats (CT52, CT74, CT77) in the present study were 4 months of age or younger and still had their juvenile dentition. the results obtained from 31 cats treated with GS-441524 exceeded expectations. the study design and treatment parameters determined from this limited field trial will be essential for future efforts in the commercialization of this or similar drugs against FIP.
