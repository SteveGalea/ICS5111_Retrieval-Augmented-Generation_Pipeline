{"summary": "six HCoVs have been identified including HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 (first identified in the 1960s), SARS-CoV (in 2003), HCoV-NL63 (in 2004), HCoV-HKU1 (in 2005) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (in 2012) (1-5) dromedary camels are considered to be a possible intermediate host for MERS-CoV. current evidence indicates that bats are likely to be the original source (12,13), and dromedary camels are considered to be a possible intermediate host. 103 substitutions per site per year (19), while HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E represent an average mutation rate of about 36104 substitutions per site per year (20,21) deletion mutation also occasionally occurred in the genome of MERS-CoV, especially in the accessory proteins (22) four HCoVs, including HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E and HCoV-HKU1, are circulating globally in human population. other four HCoVs sporadically causing severe pneumonia were also reported. in 2002\u20132004 pandemic, SARS-CoV infected over 8,000 patients. MERS-CoV attaches human host-cell receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4, CD26) (38) via receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein. spike protein plays vital role in viral assembly. nonhuman primates are useful models for pathogenesis studies and vaccine evaluations. MERS-CoV caused transient lower respiratory tract infection in rhesus macaques. clinical signs were observed by 1-day post infection and resolved as early as 4dpi. ACE2 transgenic mice infected with SARS-CoV (56) were leaded to multiple organ damage (54), resulting in the death of the animals probably due to the lethal brain infection. most recently, several MERS mouse models have been generated by replacing mouse DPP4 gene with homologous human DPP4 gene (55,57) mice were transduced intranasally with recombinant adenovirus 5 encoding hDPP4 molecule. this model supports MERS-CoV replication in the lungs. mice developed signs of interstitial pneumonia, including inflammatory cells infiltration and alveolar thickening. the average comorbidity rate is much higher in MERS patients than that of SARS patients. the mortality rate of MERS so far is about 35% which is much higher than that of SARS (10%) (7). the combination of IFN-2b or IFN-1a with ribavirin was effective in reducing MERS-CoV replication in vitro and improves outcome in MERS-CoV-infected rhesus macaques. immunodominant epitopes recognized by T cells in infected mice were found in structural protein S, M, N (53,85) these MERS-CoV-specific CD8 T cells efficiently lysed the target cells in cytotoxicity assays (53), it also had been shown that adoptive transfer of SARS-CoV-specific CD4 or CD8 T cells reduced virus titers in the infected mouse lungs (85). MERS-CoV replication is highly sensitive to type I interferon (IFN-I) treatment in cell culture suggesting that IFN-I treatment could be a possible therapeutic approach in clinical practice. innate immune response is essential for the control of coronavirus infection. coV and MERS-CoV tend to be short lived (68,83) a recent study showed that CD8 T cell response could be detected6 years after infection in convalescent MERS patients. the spike protein of MERS-CoV is considered as a key target for vaccine development against MERS-CoV infection. airway memory CD4 T cells were generated after intranasal vaccination with coV N protein and mediated protection in following CoV challenge (68) these cells could upregulated anti-viral innate response at very early stage of infection and promoted CD8 T cell response by accelerating rDC migration and CD8 T cell mobilization (68). drugs had been developed, including peptide fusion inhibitor targeting heptad-repeat region (HR) of S2 (99), small molecular entry inhibitor targeting S (100), IFN-, IFN- and ribavirin (101). Vaccine There were still no vaccines and effective antiviral therapeutics against MERS-CoV infection. airway memory CD4+ T cells mediate protective immunity against emerging respiratory coronaviruses. mAb and antiviral drugs Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies bind to MERS-CoV spike protein and prevent virus-entry and following membrane fusion. MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV replication in multiple in vitro systems (102) had been found to inhibit replication in multiple in vitro systems. efforts regarding epidemic surveillance, phylogenetic analysis, vaccine and antiviral drug developments were still needed to respond."}
