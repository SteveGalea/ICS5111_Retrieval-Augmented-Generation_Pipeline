{"summary": "more than 75% of EIDs affecting humans are, or were originally, zoonoses. many zoonoses are only transmissible from animal reservoir hosts to humans without human-to-human transmission. some zoonoses are intrinsically highly transmissible from human-to-human. in this article, we briefly review how diseases emerge, discuss the drivers for their emergence and spread and present what advances are underway to improve the prediction and detection of EIDs. infectious diseases can appear to \u201cemerge\u201d because we develop the capacity to identify a new endemic pathogen and begin to detect infections in humans. Adaptive emergence is the genetic change of a microorganism that is capable of invading a new ecosystem. emergence of SARS and MERS-CoV is thought to have been facilitated by genetic changes enhancing transmissibility between different species. a single mutation of chikungunya virus is thought to have facilitated its transmission by Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. emergence of chikungunya virus is thought to have facilitated its transmission by aedes albopictus mosquitoes. emergence of chikungunya virus is thought to have facilitated its transmission by aedes albopictus mosquitoes and its emergence in more temperate regions of the world (17). emergence of chikungunya virus is thought to have facilitated its transmission by Aedes albopictus mosquitoes and its the international community agreed to the international health regulations. this legally binding instrument came into force in 2007 with the aim of helping the international community prevent and respond to acute public health risks. surveillance for EIDs is an ongoing public health activity around the world. the idea is to \u201cget ahead of the curve\u201d so that public health actors can be poised to respond to them, or even prevent them. the key criteria include the pathogenicity of the micro-organism (i.e., the severity of the disease it causes), the potential for the pathogen to spread locally or internationally and become established in a new environment. viruses are more likely to emerge as human pathogens than other disease-causing microorganisms. some host species such as bats and rodents also have a particularly high potential to be reservoirs of pathogens that can spill over and emerge into humans. the global early warning system (GLEWS) is a warning system for health threats and emerging risks at the human\u2013animal\u2013ecosystems interface that recognizes the zoonotic nature of many EIDs. changes in technology and availability of data have led to the development of event-based surveillance systems. studies, both anticipatory and in response to ongoing EID events, are used to quantify these criteria. examples include assessment of capacity for international spread of infections (29) and the suitability of local environments for their invasion (30). other external drivers under study include levels of biodiversity; changes in biodiversity and in agriculture and land use. public health will need to focus on three elements: capacity and preparedness for EID outbreak management; surveillance for EID events; and upstream assessment of the risk of infectious disease emergence. the development of modern genomics and bioinformatics is increasing our ability to detect EID outbreaks, locate their sources (43), and identify genetic changes that can be predicted to drive disease emergence. systems that capitalize on available historical and contextual data would further strengthen the ability to detect, prepare for and manage EIDs. however, EIDs will remain a key, global public health challenge in a world where demographic, climatic and other environmental changes, including globalization, are enhancing the emergence of new pathogens."}
