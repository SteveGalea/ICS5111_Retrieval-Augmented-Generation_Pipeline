{"summary": "RVFV transmission to humans occurs through bites of infected mosquitoes or contact with tissue from infected animals. there are no FDA-approved vaccines or antivirals to prevent or treat RVFV infection, which underscores the urgent need to develop new antiviral therapies. adenoviral vector, DEF201, has been successfully used to prevent and treat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), vaccinia, and Ebola virus infections in mouse models (13, 23, 25). a defiant construct expressing mouse IFN- has been successfully used to prevent and treat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), vaccinia, and Ebola virus infections in mouse models. en and serum virus titers were assayed using an infectious cell culture assay. a specific volume of tissue homogenate or serum was serially diluted and added to triplicate wells of vero 76 cell monolayers. the viral cytopathic effect was determined 7 to 8 days post-virus inoculation. ribavirin (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Costa Mesa, CA) was given once daily by intraperitoneal injection (0.1 ml) for 6 days beginning 4 h prior to PTV challenge. up to five animals per group were sacrificed for evaluation of viral titers and liver disease on day 4 of infection. the rest were observed for morbidity and mortality. single dose i.n. treatments with 107 or 108 PFU of DEF201, 108 PFU of EV, or PBS placebo were administered on day 0 of the experiment. all animals were observed for signs of illness and weighed individually every 3 days starting on day 0. the virus was from a clarified hamster liver homogenate stock. def201 and the empty vector virus were provided by Defyrus, Inc. (Toronto, ON, Canada) a specific volume of tissue homogenate or serum was assayed. the average weight per group across the entire experiment varied by less than 5 g. ribavirin (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Costa Mesa, CA) was given once daily by intraperitoneal injection (0.1 ml) for 6 days beginning 4 h prior to PTV challenge. for the s.c. PTV challenge, 50 PFU was used as described previously (10) the 50% lethal dose by s.c. challenge is approximately 500-fold less compared to i.n. challenge. but the natural history of disease does not differ substantially between the challenge routes. the use of DEF201 was first examined in a prophylactic setting through i.n. dosing of hamsters with various PFU amounts 24 h prior to i.n. challenge. the goal of this experiment was to evaluate the DEF201 technology in the hamster PTV respiratory route infection model of acute phleboviral disease. liver virus titers measured on day 4 of infection (B) are shown. c, P 0.001 compared to results for EV-treated animals. liver virus loads were well developed (5 to 8.5 log10 CCID50/g of tissue) the magnitude and duration of cIFN- levels present in the plasma following DEF201 administration were not investigated. the ELISA used was designed for detection of human IFN-. cIFN- was detected in all DEF201-treated hamsters but not in the animals treated with the EV control virus or PBS placebo. expression levels were present on day 4 in hamsters treated with high-dose DEF201. 2 of 3 animals in the low-dose group had higher concentrations at day 8. variation in cIFN- serum concentrations may explain reduced efficacy. hamsters were treated with a single i.n. dose of DEF201 4 weeks prior to i.n. challenge. the challenge was 100% lethal in both the EV and placebo control groups. 40% of the hamsters treated with DEF201 survived the infection. ALT and serum, liver, and spleen virus titers were assessed as additional parameters to measure the extended prophylactic efficacy of DEF201. the effect was specific to DEF201, as the values for animals treated with the EV control were generally very similar to those for animals treated with the placebo. def201 treatment protects hamsters challenged with PTV by the i.n. route. surviving animals were immune to rechallenge when inoculated with the same lethal i.n. dose of PTV. viral replication in hamsters infected with PTV by the i.n. route was undetectable in the sera taken from the hamsters pretreated with DEF201. only very low titers were present in liver and spleen samples of 20 to 40% of the animals. this inhibition of viral replication correlated with the lack of protective immunity when the hamsters were rechallenged. s.c. challenge was not as aggressive as the i.n. challenge, with more of the EV-treated animals surviving the infection. def201 treatments largely controlled viral replication reflected in the virus titers in the serum and tissues, thereby preventing the development of protective immunity against rechallenge. i.n. dosing of hamsters with various PFU amounts 24 h prior to i.n. challenge with 5 103 PFU of PTV. all tested doses of 106 to 108 PFU of DEF201 protected 100% of challenged animals. 9 of 10 hamsters treated with EV control succumbed to the infection. the effect of treatments on survival (n = 8 to 10 per group for DEF201, EV, and ribavirin; n = 20 for the placebo group) (a) and liver virus titers measured on day 4 of infection (B) are shown. c, P 0.001 compared to results for EV-treated animals. cIFN- was detected in all DEF201-treated hamsters but not in the animals treated with the EV control virus or PBS placebo. a measurable increase in cIFN- concentration was detected as early as 8 h posttreatment in 1 of 3 animals treated with the 107 PFU dose of DEF201 and in 2 of 3 animals treated with the 108 PFU dose. peak cIFN- expression levels were present on day 4 in hamsters treated with high-dose DEF201. 2 of 3 animals in the low-dose group had higher concentrations at day 8. variation in cIFN- serum concentrations may explain reduced efficacy reported for hamsters pretreated 14 days prior to challenge with PICV (7). hamsters were treated i.n. with a single dose of 107 PFU of DEF201. the challenge was 100% lethal in both the EV and placebo control groups. 40% of the hamsters treated with DEF201 survived the infection. liver disease (ALT) and serum, liver, and spleen virus titers were assessed as additional parameters to measure the extended prophylactic efficacy of DEF201. the effect was specific to DEF201, as the values for animals treated with the EV control were generally very similar to those for animals treated with the placebo. however, the day 28 EV ALT data did not statistically differ from the placebo group data. def201 treatment protects hamsters challenged with PTV by the i.n. route. surviving animals were immune to rechallenge when inoculated with the same lethal i.n. dose of PTV. three of the five animals in the DEF201 +48 h group succumbed prior to time of sacrifice. differences in ALT levels were not significant (Fig. 4B to E) viral replication in hamsters infected with PTV was undetectable in the sera taken from the hamsters pretreated with DEF201. s.c. challenge was not as aggressive as the i.n. challenge, with more of the EV-treated animals surviving the infection. def201 treatments largely controlled viral replication reflected in the virus titers in the serum and tissues, thereby preventing the development of protective immunity against rechallenge. one of the five animals in the EV +6 h and +24 h groups succumbed prior to time of sacrifice. DISCUSSION RVFV is a NIAID category A pathogen with dual select agent status (CDC and USDA) requiring effective interventions to prevent and treat RVF disease during natural outbreaks, laboratory exposure, or possible intentional release. detection of cIFN- protein in the blood as early as 8 h post-DEF201 treatment suggests there may be great value in using DEF201 as a rapid-acting postexposure countermeasure. weight loss in hamsters consistent with malaise generally correlated with the level of cIFN- present in the serum. effective in reducing RVF burden by administration of a single dose to at-risk individuals or livestock every 2 to 3 weeks during a natural outbreak. the respiratory route challenge simulates inhalation exposure, which could occur due to intentional release of the virus or through processing of infected livestock."}
