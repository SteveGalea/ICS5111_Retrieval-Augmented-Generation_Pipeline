{"summary": "the same type of microarrays was used for the discovery of hypoxia-induced miRNAs. we identified 61 T-UCRs that had a significantly (P-value 0.05 Welch t-test with Benjamini\u2013Hochberg correction) altered expression in CRC when compared with normal colon tissue. a set of T-UCRs (uc.63, uc.73, uc.106, uc.134 and uc.475) were induced more than two-fold (P-value 0.05 by Student's t-test) after 48 h both of hypoxia and DMOG exposures. these transcripts were predominantly present in the nucleus. DMOG/DMSO (48 h) uc.475+ Xq13.1 OGT (O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) transferase) Intron 2 S 397 2.02 2.30 uc.63+/+A 2p15 XPO1 (Exportin 1) Intron 3 AS 278 2.51 2.11 uc.73+A 2q22.3 GTDC1 (Glycosyltransfer cell carcinoma (RCC) cell line 786-O exhibits homozygous inactivation of the von Hippel\u2013Lindau tumor suppressor gene (VHL), the well-established E3 ubiquitin ligase for all HIF family members. we hypothesized that HIF-2-induced T-UCR expression would have a similar pattern. uc.475 5\u2032-GCTCGCATGCGCGG-3\u2032 and Q6_uc.475 5\u2032-CACGTGCGC-3\u2032 were found in close proximity with each other. luciferase assay confirmed a direct connection between HIF and T-UCR (uc.475). luciferase activity in HCT-116 and HT-29 cells was measured after transfection with truncated promoter reporter constructs (PT1 and PT2) with a complete deletion of the HIF-1-binding sites present in the originally designed uc.475 promoter reporter construct (WT) control vector and constitutively active HIF-1 constructs (pcDNA 3.1-HIF-1 P/A) and pcDNA 3.1-HIF-1 3M (proline/alanine/asparagine mutant)18 in two CRC cell lines, HCT-116 and HT-29 cells. hypoxia and the active HIF-1s induced an increase (up to five-fold) in luciferase activity. the effect of uc.475 downregulation on cell survival was tested in HT-29 cells under hypoxic and normoxic conditions. these cells were chosen based on their high endogenous uc.475 expression level. each of the three siRNAs tested to be efficient reduced basal expression of uc.475 by more than 65%. siRNA against uc.475 downregulates pre-mRNA of OGT. no proliferation inhibition or altered cell cycle distribution was observed. uc.475 knockdown is a distinct effect of the OGT pre-mRNA knockdown. a mix of OGT and HINCUT-1 transcripts is found in the fourth intron of the uc.475 gene. a variant splice site is known to encode proteins of 1046 or 1036 amino acids. this catalyzes polypeptide glycosylation by the addition of O-GlcNAc to serine and threonine residues. the intron 4 region where uc.475 is located is zoomed in for better view of region of conservation in mammals. RT-qPCR data shows that the uc.475 noncoding transcript and the coding OGT transcript are expressed at similar levels. the \u2018hybrid' amplicons between the intron and the two adjacent exons are barely expressed. expression levels of uc.475 and OGT mRNA significantly increased during 12 and 24 h of normoxia in glucose-free media. after 48-h exposure, the expression of both decreased dramatically to the same or lower level observed under hypoxia in the presence or absence of glucose. in parallel, we attempted to visualize the sizes of the transcripts from this locus by using Northern blot analysis. transcript variants identified by Northern blot signals in MCF-7 cells under normoxia and hypoxia are marked by arrows and visualized by a drawing (middle) the 9-kb transcript was not predicted to encode for either of the two OGT isoforms, as the predicted ORF corresponds to 665 amino acids. uc.475 inhibition has an impact on OGT expression and function. RT-qPCR expression levels of OGT and uc.475 after uc.475 knockdown in HT-29 cells under normoxia and hypoxia. primers were designed to detect both OGT1 and OGT2 isoforms. siRNA against OGT pre-mRNA was designed to target OGT-intron 12. uc.475 downregulation led to a significant decrease in the global O-GlcNAcylation rate, an effect similar to treatment with OGT-siRNA. uc.475 DNA region also has enhancer activity under hypoxic and normoxic conditions. uc.475 enhancer activity experiments were performed in normoxia and hypoxia for 48 h. expression was normalized versus normal conditions (normoxia in HCT-116 and DMSO in MCF-7) expression was normalized versus normal conditions (normoxia in HCT-116 and DMSO in MCF-7) bars indicate the standard deviation from two sample duplicates. 0.05 by Student's t-test after 48 h both of hypoxia and DMOG exposures (Figure 1b and c) all of these transcripts were predominantly present in the nucleus, as identified by nuclear and cytoplasmic fractionation experiments (Figure 1b and c) all of these transcripts were predominantly present in the nucleus, as identified by nuclear and cytoplasmic fractionation experiments (Figure 1b and c) intron 7 S 211 2.01 2.28 Abbreviations: DMOG, dimethyloxalylglycine; DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide; HINCUT, hypoxia-induced noncoding ultraconserved transcripts Location data are according to the HUGO nomenclature. AS or +A, antisense; S or +, sense; nt, nucleotide; we used the same name for the T-UCR as for the course experiments in hypoxic models revealed that uc.475 was the most consistently induced. for uc.63, uc.73, uc.134 and uc.475, we found multiple putative HIF-binding sites per UCR (Supplementary Table 2). luciferase assay shows effect of pcDNA 3.1-HIF-1 vector constructs on promoter activity. luciferase assay normalized using empty pcDNA 3.1 vector. the error bars represent the standard deviation from two independent experiments. in-immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP) of HIF-1 in MCF-7 cells. we confirmed direct recruitment of endogenous HIF-1 at the promoters of uc.63 and uc.475, which was more evident during hypoxic conditions. for each ChIP reaction, we used the promoter of CA9 as the positive control and hemoglobin beta as the negative control. we performed knockdown experiments for uc.63 and uc.475 using custom-designed siRNAs. no major biological effect on the dynamics of COLO-205 culture was identified for uc.63. uc.475 knockdown significantly decreased cell proliferation. this effect was not the result of increased apoptosis, as poly ADP-ribose polymerase, a critical component of programmed cell death, remained uncleaved. instead, through the analysis of the cell cycle, we observed that uc.475 knockdown enriched the G2/M fraction more than two-fold at 72 and 96 h. uc.475 knockdown is a distinct effect of the OGT pre-mRNA knockdown. the effect of siRNA-targeting uc.475 on cell proliferation was determined under normoxic and hypoxia. siRNA against OGT pre-mRNA was designed to target OGT-intron 12. cosamine (O-GlcNAc) to serine and threonine residues (O-GlcNAcylation) on many nuclear and cytosolic proteins. recently, this modification was proposed to be a new link between glucose metabolism and cancer growth and invasion in breast,22 colon and lung cancer types. amplification levels were much lower when primers in the \u2018flanking' OGT exons and intron region containing uc.475 were used in combination. the transcripts were 2\u201310 times more abundant than the amplicons obtained with the mixed combinations of primers between flanking sequences of uc.475 and exons of OGT. these data support two possibilities: (a) the existence of an OGT-independent transcript that contains the fourth intron or (b) uc.475 is the part of a larger OGT primary transcript, which retains intron 4 and which is expressed in a hypoxia-dependent manner. the 9-kb transcript was not predicted to encode for either of the two OGT isoforms, as the predicted ORF correspond to 665 amino acids. RNA-seq and miRNA-seq found no annotated miRNAs or other ncRNAs within the uc.475 region. expression of uc.475 mRNA levels decreased by knocking down uc.475. expression of uc.475 mRNA levels decreased by knocking down uc.475. west blot performed to detect differences of uc.475 host gene expression levels after OGT silencing. hypoxic conditions were confirmed by CA9 induction. protein-specific bands were normalized to beta-actin as a reference protein. uc.475 ncRNA was cloned downstream of the luciferase reporter. the luciferase reporter was cloned downstream of the luciferase reporter. the luciferase reporter assays were performed on u-87 cells. hypoxia induces expression of noncoding ultraconserved transcripts in a similar manner to the conventional hypoxia-regulated genes. we identified in multiple cell types the following hypoxia-induced, noncoding ultraconserved transcripts: uc.63, uc.73, uc.106, uc.134, and uc.475. the role of OGT is to catalyze the addition of O-GlcNAc on proteins, which are involved in transcription, cellular signaling pathways and processes, and the cell cycle. 32 OGT was also recently reported to be overexpressed in breast cancer and primary and metastatic prostate cancer. retained introns within several genes were found to enhance almost every step of gene expression and also affects mRNA stability. however, some studies showed that intron retention has little or no effect on mRNA half-life,33, 34, 35.
