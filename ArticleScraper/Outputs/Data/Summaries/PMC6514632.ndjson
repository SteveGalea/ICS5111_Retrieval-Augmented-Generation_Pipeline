{"summary": "bacteriophage geneticists identified bacterial mutants capable of suppressing stop codons in viral mRNAs (2). this led to the discovery of tRNAs that are capable of reassigning the meaning of \u201cstop codons\u201d to encode specific amino acids. in the next decade, there were additional discoveries of cis-acting mRNA elements that direct ribosomes to reassign the meanings of codons. translational recoding elements direct information encoded in mRNAs to be translated in variance to the canonical rules of the genetic code. their modular nature enables individual genes to encode multiple proteins. the processes governing recoding are dynamic, yielding products from both canonical and recoded reading. recoding elements attenuate translation and thereby function as resistors. only a fraction of ribosomes that encounter a TCR signal misread the stop codon, whereas the remaining decode it \u201ccorrectly\u201d by decreasing the fraction of ribosomes that encounter a TCR signal. recoding signals are analogous to electrical resistors. incoming information (5\u2032 coding information) is shown in light blue. a TCR signal functions as a resistor by decreasing the fraction of ribosomes that are able to decode 3\u2032 genetic information. a brief discussion of translation elongation is first required. a cyclical process can be broken down into an ordered series of biochemical steps. each of these steps has been kinetically optimized to ensure that the ribosome efficiently utilizes diverse sets of trans-acting factors. ribosomes can be kinetically trapped by limiting the concentration of a tRNA required to decode a particular codon. this is the basis for +1 PRF promoted by the yeast Ty1 retrotransposable element (10\u201312) in this system, the kinetic trap is supplied by the rare in-frame (0-frame) AGG codon that is embedded in the heptameric sequence CUU AGG C. the yeast Ty1 +1 PRF signal promotes an efficiency of 40%. thus, the amplitude of the signal leaving this element is 0.4 relative to that of the incoming signal. when HSX1 is off, the Arg-tRNA is absent, enabling the ribosome to slip by one base in the 3\u2032 (+1) direction. controlling HSX1 transcription with an inducible/repressible gene promoter could be used as the basis for turning Ty1 +1 PRF on and off. repression of HSX1 transcriptional expression could be used to switch the +1 PRF signal into the \u201con\u201d position, whereas induction of this tRNA would switch this mechanism \u201coff\u201d this is the essence of a logic gate where one or more inputs are processed to produce a single (binary) output. mRNAs, DNAs, or synthetic nucleic acid-derived oligomers can be variously employed to create pseudo-stem-loops (SL) (19, 20), pseudo-pseudoknots (K) (21), pseudoknots in combination with micro-RNAs (K+ miR) (22), and potentially even pseudo-pseudo-pseudoknots (K), thus generating a wide range of resistors mRNA pseudoknots promote higher rates of 1 PRF than mRNA pseudoknots. mRNA pseudoknots present a greater challenge because their downstream stems must be fully denatured before an elongating ribosome can completely unwind the upstream stems. a specific \u201cflat\u201d sequence can be used to form a pseudo-stem-loop downstream of a slippery site. trans-acting oligonucleotides can be used to bridge the loop of a stem-loop with downstream sequence to form a \u201cpseudo-pseudoknot\u201d (K) microRNAs that stabilize a pseudoknot (K + miR) can further stimulate 1 PRF activity (22). both 1 and 2 PRF events are stimulated by the binding of a trans-acting protein complex composed of the virus-encoded nsP1 replicase subunit and the cellular poly(C)-binding protein. akin to PRF-stimulating downstream mRNA structural elements, binding of this complex to the target sequence induces ribosome pausing over this slippery site. translational riboswitches are structured RNA elements that can change their shapes, and thus their functions, when they interact with specific small molecules. riboswitches can also be exploited to create PRF signals/variable resistors. riboswitches derived from a variety of bacterial species were found to induce between 7 and 20% 1 PRF in response to increasing preQ(1) levels. the ability to ramp 1 PRF (resistance) up and down in a continuous manner is the fundamental hallmark of a rheostat. the relationship between PRF efficiency and signal strength is not linear. this is because directing ribosomes to premature termination codons in either orientation channels mRNAs to be rapidly degraded by the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway. the relationship between PRF efficiency and signal strength is not linear. in the absence of PRF, the input is equal to output, with an assigned value of 1. b, if a 1 PRF event occurs within an ORF with a frequency of 10%, the total output is not 0.1, but rather 0.01. d, inactivation of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (orange triangle) can boost signal output to 0.9 in orientation b. a +1 PRF event is degraded by ornithine decarboxylase antizyme (OAZ) synthesis of OAZ requires a +1 PRF event that is stimulated by polyamines. when polyamine levels reach a critical threshold, +1 PRF occurs on the OAZ mRNA, and it degrades ODC. the subgenomic RNA encodes the viral structural proteins that enable progeny virions. this process can be diagrammed as a simple integrated circuit flowchart. a TCR event produces the RNA-dependent polymerase. this initiates the second phase of the viral program."}
