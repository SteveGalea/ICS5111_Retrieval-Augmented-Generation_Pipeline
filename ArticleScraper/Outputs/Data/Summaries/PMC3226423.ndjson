{"summary": "in 2009-2010, influenza A (H1N1) caused 17,000 deaths worldwide. in 2002-2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) killed more than 700 people. in 2002-2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) killed more than 700 people and spread into 37 countries causing a cost of $18 billion in Asia. infection control involves blocking any stage of the infection pathway. this can mean reducing the generation of pathogens from an infectious person. this can mean reducing the generation of pathogens from an infectious person. this can mean reducing the generation of pathogens from an infectious person. in section 3, we discuss the relative merits of different ventilation systems. also discussed are the relative merits of different ventilation systems. also discussed are the factors that can influence the infection steps. the medical profession reserves the term airborne for aerosols that are transported by air currents over long time periods (minutes) and large distances (>1 m) small aerosols contribute to the airborne infection mode, while larger aerosols contribute to the droplet infection mode. human activities are key sources for dispersal of airborne pathogens. these include respiratory activities (breathing, speaking, coughing, sneezing, etc.), showering, flushing, using tap water. other human activities such as bed making, walking on carpet, or skin shedding cause resuspension of aerosols from surfaces. sneezes were studied by Jennison [13] who applied high-speed photography to track the size and motion of droplets as subjects sneezed. he determined the important length and time scales of sneezes. duguid [14] studied the sizes of droplets produced by sneezing, coughing, and speaking. droplets are in the range of 2\u20132000 m (corresponding to the entire measurement range of IMI) the large variation in reported droplet size can be attributed to three major causes: the sensitivity of different measurement techniques, the unrepeatable nature of coughs and sneezes. piiril\u00e4 and Sovijarvi performed an objective assessment of coughing. they investigated the cough as a primitive reflex typically consisting of an initiating deep inspiration, glottal closure, and an explosive expiration accompanied by a sound. the duration of the different phases of the cough reflex can be easily measured on a graph of flow versus time. gamma-probability-distribution functions will be particularly useful for setting cough and sneeze boundary conditions for CFD studies. they have combined gamma-probability-distribution functions to fit experimental data. these functions will be particularly useful for setting cough and sneeze boundary conditions. the continuum phase (air) in ventilation flow requires the integration and solution of mass, momentum, and energy equations. the fluid flow regime is determined largely by Reynolds number and Grashof number. the flow in the vicinity of a sneeze is highly turbulent and not strongly influenced by gravity or buoyancy. the most accurate way to model turbulence is direct numerical simulation (DNS) in this technique, the eddies (fluid structures) of all length scales (from small to large) are resolved. this technique requires immense computational power with increasing Re or Gr numbers, and therefore, is not applied in ventilation simulations. many researchers have used the standard or realizable k turbulence model in solving ventilation airflow [30\u201332]. compared to the standard and realizable k models, the RNG model has a better ability to model both high and low Re or Gr numbers in the same flow [29, 32\u201338]. modeling aerosol dispersion, heat, and mass transfer can be modeled using several approaches. the simplest approach is to assume that aerosols behave like gases. pathogens are termed infective only if they are able to attack host cells and reproduce themselves. a cursory review is needed because the uncertainty in infectivity data can dominate risk estimates and strongly influence ventilation design. innate and adaptive host immune responses (e.g., past exposures and/or vaccination) will modify the response to any exposure considerably. innate and adaptive host immune responses (e.g., past exposures and/or vaccination) will modify the response to any exposure considerably. a sample of pathogens is collected on a media (e.g., agar plates) and incubated over time in favorable conditions. the colony-forming unit (CFU) will then be the measure of the pathogen's ability to reproduce. it is important to account for viability and physical losses of pathogenic aerosols separately. plaque assay methods reveal information about pathogen's ability to attach and infect living cells under favorable conditions. however, it is very difficult to extrapolate true infectivity of a pathogen for the host due to the variability of host factors already listed. any measurement technique, at best, approximates true viability and infectivity. if molecular methods are used, accurate counts of pathogens are possible. if plaque assay methods are used, some degree of pathogen interaction with the host is accounted for. aerosol inactivation studies are more consistent for viruses than for bacteria. viruses with lipids in their outer membrane are more stable at low relative humidities (20%\u201330%) than at high relative humidities. some nonlipid membrane viruses include respiratory Adenoviruses and Rhinoviruses. Klebsiella pneumoniae demonstrates relative stability (higher viability) at intermediate relative humidities. some studies have also shown that Gram-negative Pasteurella species survive better at high relative humidities. temperatures as low as 7\u00b0C -8\u00b0C are optimal for airborne influenza survival, with survival decreasing progressively at moderate temperatures of 20.5\u00b0C\u201324\u00b0C. studies have shown that higher temperatures of about 30\u00b0C actually block the transmission of influenza. outdoor air is often more toxic to pathogens than indoor air, especially in urban areas. inactivation is probably caused by a multitude of factors including pollutant concentration, relative humidity, pressure fluctuations, and air ions. many factors have synergistic effects (e.g., temperature and relative humidity), making it difficult to formulate a comprehensive model. the model parameters are fit experimentally for the viability decay of each microbial aerosol of interest. the exponential decay model (4) predicts the viability to be near zero when the aerosol age is large. this is contrary to experimental data that show an initial fast decay followed by a slow decay causing viability to asymptotically approach a nonzero minimum value. high-order kinetic and catastrophe models for pathogen inactivation are more biologically plausible than the exponential model. but rarely is there sufficient data to support the more sophisticated models. advantages and disadvantages of different viability models are listed in Table 6. deposition of aerosols in the respiratory tract depends on the tract morphology. respiration mode and breathing pattern must be considered in modeling aerosol deposition in the human lung. infection risk models can be either deterministic or stochastic. in deterministic models, each individual is hypothesized to have an inherent tolerance dose for an infectious agent. deterministic models do not determine whether an individual will fall sick under certain dosage conditions. the well-mixed Wells-Riley model is used with experimental measurements of the quanta of infection. this information is implicitly embedded in the model by the quantum generation (q) a host organism is assumed to have an inherent minimal infective dose. if it is exposed to a dose in excess of this minimal amount, then an observed response will result. the second model can be described as stochastic hypothesis. Sze-To and Chao have developed an infection risk model. by this approach, a model can be formed that gives the airborne infection risk for a subject (moving or stationary) as a function of time. population or epidemic infection models simulate dynamics in a total population (N) that consists of the susceptible (S), infected (I) and recovered (R) subpopulations [3, 65]. the model complexities depend on the number of parameters considered. the wells-Riley models extend infection risk prediction to a population. the medical profession reserves the term airborne for aerosols that are transported by air currents over long time periods (minutes) and large distances (>1 m) small aerosols contribute to the airborne infection mode, while larger aerosols contribute to the droplet infection mode. eria have diameters in the range of 0.5\u201310 m. human activities are key sources for dispersal of airborne pathogens. these include respiratory activities (breathing, speaking, coughing, sneezing, etc.), showering, flushing, using tap water. various medical procedures also contribute to pathogen transmission. sneezes and sneezes were studied by Jennison [13] who applied high-speed photography to track the size and motion of droplets as subjects sneezed. duguid [14] studied the sizes of droplets produced by sneezing, coughing, and speaking. the large variation in reported droplet size can be attributed to three major causes. the physiology of coughing is described by McCool [20] as a three-phase reflex. piiril\u00e4 and Sovijarvi [21] performed an objective assessment of coughing. they investigated the cough as a primitive reflex typically consisting of an initiating deep inspiration, glottal closure, and an explosive expiration accompanied by a sound. the duration of the different phases of the cough reflex can be easily measured on a graph of flow versus time. gupta et al. [24] performed an experimental study to characterize the flow rate versus time profile of a human exhalation. they combined gamma-probability-distribution functions to fit experimental data. such functions will be particularly useful for setting cough and sneeze boundary conditions for CFD studies. small aerosols contribute to the airborne infection mode, while larger aerosols contribute to the droplet infection mode. there is agreement that aerosols smaller than 5 m in aerodynamic diameter (also called droplet nuclei [5]) contribute to airborne infection. some procedures that may increase droplet nuclei generation are intubation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, bronchoscopy, autopsy, and surgery with high-speed devices. each building facility has its own microbial ecology that supports the growth of certain kinds of pathogens and suppresses the growth of others. papineni and Rosenthal studied the size distribution of droplets exhaled by healthy individuals while mouth breathing, nose breathing, talking, and coughing. they used an optical particle counter (OPC) in the range of 0.09\u20133.0 m. the physiology of coughing is described by McCool [20] as a three-phase reflex: inspiration, compression, and expiration. the peak flow rate in a cough may reach as high as 12 L/s. the duration of the glottal closure during the compressive phase of cough varies in the range of 0.09\u20131.01 s. they also defined a useful parameter in characterizing the cough, the cough peak expiratory flow rate (CPEF) aerosols evaporate at different time scales according to their size. small droplets (20 m) evaporate faster time scales (milliseconds) than larger droplets (>50 m) for which the evaporation time is in the order of seconds. the fluid flow regime is determined largely by the Reynolds number and Grashof number (dimensionless ratio of intertial to viscous forces, Re = VL/) in these equations, V is velocity, L is length scale, is kinematic viscosity, g is gravitational acceleration, is coefficient of thermal expansion, and T is far-field temperature. the process of airborne infection in a room involves widely different scales. the large eddy simulation (LES) technique has been developed that resolves larger eddies but uses simple models of the smaller scales of the flow. the basic motivation behind this idea is that large eddies are the primary mechanisms transporting aerosols over large distances. the Reynolds stress model (RSM) allows for anisotropy of turbulence and provides better results if the initial solution is guessed properly. an alternative approach is to combine RANS and LES to obtain a detached eddy simulation (DES) LES is used in areas of strong large-scale unsteadiness such as in the wake of a person. the trajectory of an aerosol can be determined by the force balance that equates the aerosol inertia with the forces acting on it. g is gravitational acceleration, p is aerosol density, is continuum phase density, and F is the acceleration per unit mass caused by the Brownian force. a large ensemble of droplets of various sizes are tracked stochastically. bin-based mean dispersion locations and diameters are reported for a distribution of aerosols. many literature studies adopt this modeling approach [30\u201332, 34, 38]. the most accurate way to model turbulence is direct numerical simulation (DNS) in this technique, the eddies (fluid structures) of all length scales (from small to large) are resolved. this technique requires immense computational power with increasing Re or Gr numbers, and therefore, is not applied in ventilation simulations. most RANS models are computationally economic and provide useful results. but they do not consider anisotropy of turbulence and often have difficulty to reach a converged solution. alternative approach is to combine RANS and LES to obtain a detached eddy simulation (DES) modeling aerosol dispersion, heat, and mass transfer can be modeled using several approaches. the simplest approach is to assume that aerosols behave like gases. f g, (3) where m p is aerosol mass, c p is aerosol specific heat capacity, h is convective heat transfer coefficient, and h fg is latent heat of vaporization. a large ensemble of droplets of various sizes are tracked stochastically, and bin-based mean dispersion locations and diameters are reported for a distribution of aerosols. pathogens are termed infective only if they are able to attack hall et al. studied viral shedding patterns of ambulatory children with influenza B. the infection symptoms varied in type and time depending on previous infections/diseases that the children already had. these intrahost mechanisms/factors are not within scope of this paper. the colony-forming unit (CFU) will then be the measure of the pathogen's ability to reproduce. it is important to account for viability and physical losses of pathogenic aerosols separately. viability for these aerostable spores or radioactive marked cells does not change in a wide range of environmental conditions. to form a plaque assay, aerosols are sampled and multifold dilutions of a pathogen stock are prepared. a plaque forms around damaged cells, and it grows until limited by the gel structure of the plate. this visual plaque allows for titer calculation of the pathogen in plaque-forming units (PFUs) per unit space. if molecular methods are used, accurate counts of pathogens are possible. but the estimates for their reproducibility and true interaction with the host are compromised. the validity for prediction of airborne infection risk in a given building ventilation setting is limited to the type of viability and infectivity measurement technique used. outer membrane are more stable at low relative humidities (20%\u201330%) than at high relative humidities. the nucleic acid for viruses without lipid membrane may be isolated and not detected during desiccation. some nonlipid membrane viruses include respiratory Adenoviruses and Rhinoviruses. cox [43] has defined the latter as meaning that the organism is aerosolized from a dry dust or freeze-dried powder. the latter means that the organism is aerosolized from a liquid suspension, for example, human mucus or saliva. such changes in water content affect the viability behavior. culture experiments show that temperatures as low as 7\u00b0C -8\u00b0C are optimal for airborne influenza survival, with survival decreasing progressively at moderate temperatures of 20.5\u00b0C\u201324\u00b0C. studies generally show that at temperature above about 24\u00b0C, bacteria appear to universally lose viability. this reduced viability has been observed in members of Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and intracellular bacteria. various experimental efforts have been undertaken to correlate OAF mechanisms with known mechanisms of pathogen inactivation. in separate experiments, various exposures of OAF have been introduced to inactivate organisms. it was found that OAF is most closely correlated with ozone (O3) and C3H6. the model parameters are fit experimentally for the viability decay of each microbial aerosol of interest. during and after the aerosolization of a microbial solution, there is a period of stabilization. During this initial time period, many microbes experience shear stresses. the exponential decay model predicts the viability to be near zero when the aerosol age is large. this is contrary to experimental data that show an initial fast decay followed by a slow decay causing viability to asymptotically approach a nonzero minimum value. a series of higher-order kinetic models have been developed by Cox [57]. the advantages and disadvantages of the viability models described above are listed in Table 6. viability model Advantages Disadvantages Exponential Simple, easy to fit, reasonable agreement with experiments Underestimation of viability at long durations Higher order kinetic Physically plausible, good agreement with experiments Difficult to fit, too many model varieties 2.3.1. animal tests for airborne infection consider many physical and biological aspects of pathogen viability and infectivity. some researchers have added aerostable spores or radioactively marked cells of a known proportion to the pathogen of interest whose viability is going to be studied. viability for these aerostable spores or radioactive marked cells does not change in a wide range of environmental conditions. the ability of a pathogen to attack and damage a cell is measured. a plaque forms around damaged cells, and it grows until limited by the gel structure of the plate. this visual plaque allows for titer calculation of the pathogen in plaque-forming units per unit space. if plaque assay methods are used, some degree of pathogen interaction with the host is accounted for, while an accurate count of pathogens is compromised. the validity for prediction of airborne infection risk in a given building ventilation setting is limited to the type of viability and infectivity measurement technique used. viruses without lipids are more stable at high relative humidities (70%\u201390%) than at low relative humidities. the nucleic acid for viruses without lipid membrane may be isolated and not detected during desiccation. some nonlipid membrane viruses include respiratory Adenoviruses and Rhinoviruses. cox [43] has defined the latter as meaning that the organism is aerosolized from a dry dust or freeze-dried powder. the latter means that the organism is aerosolized from a liquid suspension, for example, human mucus or saliva. the wet-disseminated bacteria lose water to the environment by evaporation. \u00b0C are optimal for airborne influenza survival, with survival decreasing progressively at moderate temperatures of 20.5\u00b0C\u201324\u00b0C. studies generally show that at temperature above about 24\u00b0C, bacteria appear to universally lose viability. this reduced viability has been observed in members of Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and intracellular bacteria. various experimental efforts have been undertaken to correlate OAF mechanisms with known mechanisms of pathogen inactivation. in separate experiments, various exposures of OAF have been introduced to inactivate organisms. it was found that OAF is most closely correlated with ozone (O3) and C3H6. the model parameters are fit experimentally for the viability decay of each microbial aerosol of interest. during and after the aerosolization of a microbial solution, there is a period of stabilization. the initial stabilization period is fast relative to the airborne lifetime of aerosols. experimental data show an initial fast decay followed by a slow decay causing viability to asymptotically approach a nonzero minimum value. a series of higher-order kinetic models have been developed by Cox [57] to overcome this difficulty. viability model Advantages Disadvantages Exponential Simple, easy to fit, reasonable agreement with experiments Underestimation of viability at long durations Higher order kinetic Physically plausible, good agreement with experiments Difficult to fit, too many model varieties 2.4. Inhalation and Deposition 2.4.1. Respiratory System Construction The human respiratory system is comprised of three regions: (i) an upper respiratory portion consisting of the nasopharynx and mouth. the breathing pattern can occur either as regulated or spontaneous breathing. larger tidal volumes result in higher aerosol deposition in the lung. lower flow rates also result in higher aerosol deposition by sedimentation and diffusion processes. the respiration mode and breathing pattern must be considered in modeling aerosol deposition in the human lung. a temperature of 37\u00b0C and relative humidity of 99.5% may be assumed for nasal respiration. relative humidity and temperature affect the growth of hygroscopic aerosols in the human lung. this causes the aerosol diameter and density to change. actual aerosol sizes for in vivo and in vitro experiments may be different. the first airborne infection model in an epidemiological study in a measles outbreak is based on the concept of quanta of infection. the well-mixed Wells-Riley equation assumes a well-mixed room air and a steady-state infectious aerosol concentration which varies with the ventilation rate (Q) dose-response models require infection data to construct dose-response relationship. the tolerance dose concept is biologically plausible, since it considers the variation of immune status and the host's sensitivity in the subjects. ized tolerance dose, N is the intake dose, and are the mean and standard deviation of natural logarithm of the tolerance dose. these statistics are determined by fitting the infection dose data for a pathogen in an experiment. these models predict infection risk only for one suspect (as opposed to a population) a stochastic and nonthreshold dose-response model for the airborne infection risk can be formed. v(x, t) is the volume density of expiratory droplets at the location. v(x, t) is the volume density of expiratory droplets at the location. the work of Noakes et al. [3] has integrated the Wells-Riley model into a population infection model. they have also developed a population model that finds infection rate for a multizone health care facility. they do not resolve infection risk spatially, since they assume well-mixed distribution for airborne pathogens. the well-mixed Wells-Riley model predicts infection risk. other studies have incorporated effects of respirator filtration, viability loss of pathogens, and inactivation of pathogens by ultraviolet irradiation. the well-mixed model is applied to small subdomains of the room. deterministic dose-response models are direct implementation of the tolerance dose concept. these models require experimental infection data for a population to fit a curve for the distribution of the tolerance dose. some experimental infection results suggest that the distribution of the tolerance dose can be described log-normally. a dose-response model can be formed that gives the airborne infection risk for a subject (moving or stationary) as a function of time. the exposure level of the pathogen at location x and during time interval t 0 is given by E ( x, t 0 ) = c p 0 t 0 v ( x, t ) f ( t ) d t, (8) where c is the pathogen population or epidemic infection models simulate dynamics in a total population (N) that consists of the susceptible (S), infected (I) and recovered (R) subpopulations. the models are termed population or epidemic infection models and simulate dynamics in a total population (N). mechanical ventilation systems are fan driven. positive pressure mechanical ventilation systems are fanned on intake and result in exfiltration of space. negative pressure mechanical ventilation systems are fanned on exhaust and result in infiltration of space. mixing and displacement ventilation systems aims at creating a uniform low concentration of infected air that is subsequently extracted. the air is supplied along the ceiling with high turbulence for effective mixing. standard 170 of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-conditioning Engineers defines various functional spaces in health care facilities. the code requires continuous negative differential air pressure with the exhaust directed to the outside without mixing with other exhaust streams in the facility. class A surgery provides minor surgical procedures without preoperative sedation or under analgesic or dissociative drugs. the code requires positive pressure differential for class B and C surgery rooms. the return exhaust grilles should be near floor level. spores take advantage of humid conditions to germinate and multiply. ASHRAE 170 limits the amount of relative humidity to a maximum value of 90% throughout the duct work of any HVAC system. ACH is a useful but blunt instrument to assess the ventilation rate of a space. ASHRAE defines various air supply diffuser types according to Table 9. vertical upward type displacement ventilation introduces fresh cool air near the bottom. cool air drops due to negative buoyancy and reaches the floor if air mixing is avoided. the arrangement of inlet and outlet openings can cause different flow recirculation scales which may change the mean age of indoor contaminants. a useful technique for optimizing properties of inlet and outlet openings is to use tracer gas experiments. a vertical stack at each room allows for air movement to the roof. in a solar atrium stack, a large stack is heated by solar radiation. in top-down systems, the fan extraction is assisted by a wind tower. a malfunctioning upward displacement ventilation system can create recirculation zones that keep aerosols in the domain for long periods of time. thermal plumes increase mixing in downward displacement ventilation systems, impeding aerosol removal through low level exhausts. Yin et al. [74] studied dispersion of tracer gas and nonevaporating aerosols. they used a tracer gas (SF 6), 1 m and 3 m aerosols that were released at steady rate at patient bed. a particle counter was used to measure concentration at different heights. the most efficient design is to locate diffuser and exhaust face to face at the same height and at opposite sides of the room. the complexities arise for actual rooms with occupancy and heat gains, in which scenario a detailed study must be performed. recirculated air with high-efficiency particulate air filters reduces particulate concentration for indoor air similar to full outside air systems. Cole and Cook report that ventilation plus recirculating air filtration could reduce droplet nuclei concentrations with 30%\u201390% effectiveness. MERV rating is a measurement scale designed by ASHRAE to rate the effectiveness of air filters. medium MERV rating filters are still capable of removing airborne pathogens, especially spores, without high operation costs. the overall removal efficiency of the filter system is improved if the filter is placed in the recirculation loop instead of the outside air intake or downstream of the cooling coils. pathogens usually come from a source, either a human being or an object. they can be managed by segregation of human sources and also regular cleaning and inspection of materials. patients with Tuberculosis can be housed in negative pressure rooms, required to wear masks, or placed in laminar flow beds until recovered. natural ventilation systems rely on natural forces such as wind or a density-generated pressure differences between indoor and outdoor to drive air through building openings. some purpose-built openings include doors, windows, solar chimneys, and wind towers. infected air is supplied along the ceiling with high turbulence for effective mixing. the air is supplied along the ceiling with high turbulence for effective mixing. in practice, neither pure mixing nor pure displacement ventilation can be achieved. airborne infection isolation rooms are defined as spaces to isolate patients with highly infectious diseases (e.g., tuberculosis and influenza) for these rooms, the code requires continuous negative differential air pressure with the exhaust directed to the outside without mixing with other exhaust streams in the facility. the code requires these rooms to be well sealed and to provide continuous positive differential air pressure. ASHRAE 170 requires a temperature range of 20\u00b0C \u201326\u00b0C and a relative humidity range of 30%\u201360% for most health care functional spaces. the building code has not yet been refined to require specific combinations of temperature and relative humidity to reduce airborne infection risk. some environmental conditions are against human comfort or the recovery process. ACH is a useful but blunt instrument to assess the ventilation rate of a space. rooms with short-circuited airflow patterns will have very high ventilation effectiveness in some areas. stagnant air in other areas corresponds with very low ventilation effectiveness. vertical upward type displacement ventilation introduces cool air near the bottom. cool air drops due to negative buoyancy and reaches the floor if air mixing is avoided. ASHRAE 170 [72] strictly bans the use of upward displacement ventilation in health care facilities. wind pressure and stack (or buoyancy) pressure are standardized by the dynamic pressure of the outdoor wind speed. the stack (or buoyancy) pressure is generated by the air temperature difference between indoor and outdoor air. this difference generates an imbalance in the pressure gradients of the inside and outside air columns. major design elements for natural or hybrid ventilation systems require site analysis, building design analysis, and vent opening design. occupation density is an important factor affecting airflow distribution structure in a space. overcrowding is often correlated with increased rates of infection. air exchange rate (ACH) is defined differently for positive and negative pressure rooms. a higher ACH results in more dilution of pathogens and reduced airborne infection risk. most building codes mandate a minimum ACH to prevent airborne disease transmission by sufficient air dilution. standard 170 of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-conditioning Engineers defines various functional spaces in health care facilities. airborne infection isolation rooms are defined as spaces to isolate patients with highly infectious diseases (e.g., tuberculosis and influenza) the code requires continuous negative differential air pressure with the exhaust directed to the outside without mixing with other exhaust streams in the facility. ASHRAE 170 requires a temperature range of 20\u00b0C \u201326\u00b0C and a relative humidity range of 30%\u201360% for most health care functional spaces. the building code has not yet been refined to require specific combinations of temperature and relative humidity to reduce airborne infection risk. ACH is a useful but blunt instrument to assess the ventilation rate of a space. rooms with short-circuited airflow patterns will have very high ventilation effectiveness in some areas. stagnant air in other areas corresponds with very low ventilation effectiveness. vertical upward type displacement ventilation introduces fresh cool air near bottom. cool air drops due to negative buoyancy and reaches floor if air mixing is avoided. ASHRAE 170 [72] strictly bans the use of upward displacement ventilation in all health care facilities. wind pressure is standardized by the dynamic pressure of the outdoor wind speed. the stack pressure is generated by the air temperature difference between indoor and outdoor air. this difference generates an imbalance in the pressure gradients of the inside and outside air columns. major design elements for natural or hybrid ventilation systems require site analysis, building design analysis, and vent opening design. site analysis concerns building location, layout, orientation, and landscaping; vent opening design concerns the position, type, size, and control of openings. overcrowding is often correlated with increased rates of infection. experimental studies of aerosol dispersion in different ventilation systems. they performed CFD simulations and IMI experiments to determine expiratory droplet dispersion in a hospital ward with mixing type ventilation system. they used an air-blast nozzle for droplet generation and injection. Yin et al. [74] studied dispersion of tracer gas and fine monodisperse nonevaporating aerosols in mixing and displacement ventilation systems. they used a tracer gas (SF 6), 1 m and 3 m aerosols that were released at steady rate at patient bed. an APS was used to measure the aerosol concentration at various locations. a study by Escombe et al. in Peruvian hospitals in Lima revealed that opening doors and windows could provide a median ventilation of 28 ACH for inpatient rooms. they also reported that facilities built more than 50 years ago provided a median ventilation of 40 ACH. table 10 shows different classes of MERV rating, each designed to filter aerosols in a specific range. ASHRAE 170 requires up to two filter banks in the design of any health care ventilation system. filter bank no. 1 is placed upstream of the heating and cooling coils and the supply fans to filter all of the incoming mixed air. filtration of aerosols in the range of 0.1\u20130.3 m with economic solutions. ultraviolet radiation can play a key role in disinfecting pathogens or limiting their growth. ultraviolet radiation impairs fungal growth and in some cases kills spores. MERV rating is a measurement scale designed by ASHRAE to rate the effectiveness of air filters. MERV Typical controlled contaminant [m] Dust spot efficiency [%] Arrestance [%] 17\u201320 0.3 NA1 NA 13\u201316 0.3\u20131.0 >90 >98 9\u201312 1.0\u20133.0 >40 >90 5\u20138 3.0\u201310 >20 >80 1\u20134 >10 >20 >65 1NA: not applicable. medium MERV rating filters are still capable of removing airborne pathogens, especially spores, without high operation costs. more efficient filters cause more pressure drop, and hence require auxiliary fans or air pumps to supply the required pressure. filtration of aerosols in the range of 0.1\u20130.3 m with economic solutions. patients with Tuberculosis can be housed in negative pressure rooms, required to wear masks, or placed in laminar flow beds until recovered. room layout and division of floor plan into subspaces connected by corridors can be designed carefully to segregate pathogen sources from suspects. mold-contaminated building materials can be purged by hot water systems, filters and HVAC units can be regularly inspected and cleaned to eliminate surface sources. new research shows a positive correlation between airborne or surface dust mass and corresponding fungi, bacteria, and viruses. dust control can be a preventive measure in reducing pathogen sources. the current state of research has also shown that important sources for airborne pathogens including human activity. the viability and infectivity response of various airborne pathogens to environmental conditions have also been understood and quantified. animal tests, culture methods, molecular methods, and plaque assay methods have been used to measure pathogen viability and infectivity decay rates for many different classes of microbes. the effect of different ventilation strategies (mixing, displacement, and natural) on air exchange rates has also been studied. the airborne infection pathway is considered to be important for some pathogens such as influenza and tuberculosis. however, there is still uncertainty about the relative importance of different infection pathways for many other diseases. most efforts to reduce airborne infection risk are limited to increasing air exchange rates and higher dilution of contaminated air. each ventilation strategy (i.e., mechanical, displacement, or hybrid) results in a certain airflow distribution and ventilation effectiveness (10) for the whole spatial domain. the momentum (breathing versus sneezing) and direction (vertical versus horizontal) of human expirations disturb the ventilation airflow and need to be considered for effective ventilation design. to improve the airflow structure, it is required to use CFD simulations. a large class of aerosolized pathogens are yet to be analyzed. the effect of OAF (relying on natural ventilation) and electromagnetic radiation (relying on daylighting and UV disinfection) on the survival of pathogens need to be studied in greater detail. future research should reveal more detailed mechanisms for pathogen survival behavior. filtration technology needs to improve for removing aerosols in the range of 0.1\u20130.3 m efficiently. the lack of actual infection mechanisms and infection dosage is another challenge. most infection outbreaks in history provide limited information. airborne infection pathway is considered to be important for some pathogens such as tuberculosis and influenza. there is still uncertainty about the relative importance of different infection pathways for many diseases. expiratory activities disperse pathogens such as influenza and tuberculosis. but it is still an open question whether the generation of other pathogens by expiration is also important. if thermal plumes in a room increase flow circulation and mixing, it will increase the airborne infection risk. if thermal plumes in a room increase flow circulation and mixing, it will increase the airborne infection risk. such effects must carefully be considered and modeled to arrive at occupation-specific recommendations in building code. effects of ventilation design on airflow distribution structure. most efforts to reduce airborne infection risk are limited to increasing air exchange rates and higher dilution of contaminated air. the interaction of expiratory pathogens with ventilation airflow needs to be researched in greater detail. the momentum (breathing versus sneezing) and direction (vertical versus horizontal) of human expirations disturb the ventilation airflow and need to be considered for effective ventilation design. a large class of aerosolized pathogens are yet to be analyzed. the effect of environmental factors, such as temperature and relative humidity, on the survival of some aerosolized pathogens has been studied. the literature is limited to a few diseases, and a large class of aerosolized pathogens are yet to be analyzed. future research should reveal more detailed mechanisms for pathogen survival behavior as a function of temperature and relative humidity. the building code will recommend more specific environmental conditions to reduce airborne infection risk in a pathogen-specific fashion. most infections in history provide limited information, making it difficult to fully analyze and arrive at the desired conclusions. even empirical quanta estimations in well-mixed rooms using the Wells-Riley model (1) combine various complicated and interconnected factors."}
