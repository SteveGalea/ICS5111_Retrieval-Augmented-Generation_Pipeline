{"summary": "introduction p62 was initially identified in humans as a phosphotyrosine independent ligand of the src homology 2 domain of p56 lck (1, 2). p56lck is a member of the c-src family of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases that is found predominantly in cells of lymphoid origin (3, 4). p62 associates with the ser/Thr kinase (1, 2), atypical the fate of ubiquitinated substrates depends on the number of ubiquitin moieties conjugated, as well as the lysine linkage of Ub-Ub conjugation. the conjugation of ubiquitin to eukaryotic intracellular proteins is one way in which those proteins are targeted to the proteasome for subsequent rapid degradation. p62 appears to sequester ubiquitinated substrates into a cytoplasmic structure referred to as a sequestosome. p62 is an immediate early response gene product for a variety of signals. p62 appears to play a novel regulatory role for polyubiquitinated proteins. in vitro expression cloning was performed using the ProteoLink IVEC system. rabbit reticulocyte lysate was pre-mixed with most of the reaction components necessary to carry out transcription/translation in the lysate. reactions mixtures also contained ubiquitin so that the newly synthesized proteins could be ubiquitinated. potential positive \u201chits\u201d were further subdivided and re-assayed to link individual clones to the protein of interest. p62 protein pools were divided into 24 mixed protein pools for use in p62 UBA pull down assays. individual cDNA pool from which the positive protein pool was generated was transformed into JM109 competent cells and plated on LB ampicillin plate. individual colonies were chosen to grow overnight in 1 ml of LB media plus ampicillin. 750 mg of protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-myc and collected with agarose-coupled secondary antibody. agarose beads containing the immunoprecipitated HSP70 included 50 ml of reaction buffer. the rabbit polyclonal anti-myc antibody, mouse monoclonal anti-myc and anti-ubiquitin antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc (Santa Cruz, CA). ubiquitin K63 only (Ub K63, ubiquitin with all lysines mutated to arginines except K63), Ub K29, Ub K48 were from Boston Biochem Inc. the reactions were set up according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Rabbit reticulocyte lysate has been shown to be capable of carrying out ubiquitination of newly synthesized proteins that were translated in such an in vitro translation system. 96 pools were divided into 24 mixed protein pools for use in p62 UBA pull down assays. positive mixed protein pools were selected and individual pools were retested for its ability to bind p62\u2019s UBA domain. individual colonies were chosen to grow overnight in 1 ml of LB media plus ampicillin plate. the protein concentration of the supernatant was determined using the bio-Rad DC protein assay reagent with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as standard. equal amount of protein (750 mg) was immunoprecipitated with anti-myc and collected with agarose-coupled secondary antibody. well plates with 100 cDNAs per well were transcribed using the gold TNT SP6 Express 96 plate in the presence of [35S] methionine and ubiquitin (25 mg/ml, Sigma) by combining 4 protein pools as one mixed pool, 96 protein pools were divided into 24 mixed protein pools. each lane contained more than 100 proteins (theoretically 400) with different molecular weight. a mixed protein pool synthesized by IVEC system was tested in the presence of agarose beads alone or in the presence of p62 UBA agarose beads. our results revealed that proteins that bound to p62\u2019s UBA domain could not be pulled down by agarose beads alone. the agarose-immobilised p62 UBA peptide had binding specificity. a secondary screen was conducted on the 6 positive individual mixed pools. mixed protein pool # 2 generated a positive protein with molecular weight of 51 KDa. only individual protein pool \u201cc\u201d out of the four protein pools had a protein with the same molecular weight. individual proteins were released by boiling for 2 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. positive \u201chits\u201d marked by arrows and the positive individual protein pools were underlined. cDNAs from the positive individual protein pools were then transformed into JM109 competent cells. protein zeta isoform Located in neurofibrillary tangles of AD B4 #18 96% Syntaxin binding protein (munc18) 1 Interact with X11 and reduce b-amyloid B4 #24 99% FK506 binding protein (FKBP) 14 Ligands as neurological disorders therapeutics C5 #19 99% Homeobox protein Meis2 Brain development E7 #9 97% Transketolase Decreased activity in dementia of syntaxin binding protein munc18 can powerfully regulate amyloid precursor protein metabolism and b-amyloid secretion through direct and indirect interactions with X11 proteins. activity of transketolase has been reported to be reduced in dementia of Alzheimer\u2019s type brain (25). heat shock protein HSP70 expression is significantly increased in temporal cortex of patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (26) p62 has been reported to accumulate early in neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer\u2019s disease (33), suggesting that p62 may play an important role in Alzheimer\u2019s disease by interacting with those proteins through its UBA domain. another set of proteins identified in the screen that bind to p62\u2019s UBA domain are associated with brain development, including homeobox protein Meis2 and unc51 like kinase II. polyubiquitin chains assembled through lysine 48 of ubiquitin act as a signal for substrate proteolysis by the 26S proteasome (42-44). in order to understand whether the proteins identified in our screen bind to the p62\u2019s UBA domain through lysine 48 (K48), polyubiquitin K48 chains were added to the p62 UBA pull down assay. the rabbit reticulocyte lysate contained enzymes such as TRAF6 (E3) and UbcH7 (E2) for in vitro ubiquitination. the individual proteins were synthesized by employing TNT Quick Coupled in vitro transcription/translation system. ubiquitin resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE and exposed to X-ray film. western blot of rabbit reticulocyte lysate with TRAF6 (E3) and UbcH7 (E2). myc-tagged HSP70 protein expressed in HEK cells was immunoprecipitated by myc-polyclonal antibody and used as a source of substrate for in vitro ubiquitination. in vivo interaction of HSP70 and p62 in vivo was confirmed by transfecting myc-tagged HSP70 into HEK 293 cells. the reactions were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and Western blotted with myc monoclonal antibody to detect HSP70 or with ubiquitin monoclonal antibody to detect ubiquitination. the cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with p62 polyclonal antibody, followed by Western blot with anti-myc monoclonal antibody. this approach could be readily adapted to high throughput screening. 96 well plates with 100 cDNAs per well were transcribed and translated using the gold TNT SP6 Express 96 plate in the presence of [35S] methionine and ubiquitin. each lane contained more than 100 proteins (theoretically 400) each lane appeared as a smear, indicating that proteins synthesized by the IVEC system are also ubiquitinated. a mixed protein pool synthesized by IVEC system was tested in the presence of agarose beads alone or in the presence of p62 UBA agarose beads. our results revealed that proteins that bound to p62\u2019s UBA domain could not be pulled down by agarose beads alone. mixed protein pool #
