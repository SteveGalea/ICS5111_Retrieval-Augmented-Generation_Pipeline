{"summary": "multiplex PCR panels are more rapid and more sensitive methods of virus detection than cultures or antigen detection (1, 2). one such method, the filmArray respiratory panel (FARP) (BioFire Diagnostics, Inc.), is a multiplex, nested PCR technique that can detect 17 common respiratory viruses and 3 bacterial targets simultaneously. retrospective case-control study evaluates concordance between FARP testing on NP and BAL samples. all patients who were included had a BAL sample FARP performed within 7 days after an NP swab FARP (NP FARP) during the same hospitalization or illness episode. NP specimens were collected with a flocked swab and UTM transport medium. samples (0.3 ml) of the UTM (NP swab) or BAL fluid were loaded into the filmArray v1.6 pouch with the filmArray loading device. a full validation was completed for using the BAL specimen as a source for the FARP. RPs performed 7 days or less (mean, 1.6 days; median, 1 day; range, 0 to 6 days) after NP FARPs. only 8 patients (9%) had an interval of 4 days or more, and of these only 1 had an interval of 6 days. documented indications for NP or BAL FARP included upper or lower respiratory tract illness or symptoms. 66 of the 86 patients (77%) had concordant results for the NP and BAL FARPs. the remaining 66 had concordant negative results, and 15 had concordant pathogen recoveries between the NP and BAL FARPs. 25 of the 86 patients had additional pathogens of limited clinical significance (e.g., Candida sp., coagulase-negative staphylococcus, and Epstein-Barr virus) found on BAL sample cultures or PCRs (not tested for by the FARP) solid tumor, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, acute myelodysplastic syndrome, myeloma, lymphoma, stem cell transplant, or solid organ transplants. studies have shown their utility for the rapid identification of pathogens, which is especially useful for achieving a prompt diagnosis in complex cases. our data show that the FARP had a 37% positivity rate from BAL specimens, slightly higher than that in a study by Hammond et al. (2). among the 56 BAL specimens tested, the positivity rate in the BAL specimens was around 50%. the question we sought to answer was whether results for an NP swab would be indicative of the findings on a subsequent BAL specimen. the risk of antibiotic-related complications and adverse events, emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens, and increased health care costs (11) some studies are beginning to support the theory that rapid multiplex testing for respiratory pathogens decreases the length of stay and time in isolation while reducing the duration of antimicrobial use. a NP FARP can be obtained on an NP FARP because no additional information is gained by repeating the FARP on a BAL sample within 7 days after a positive NP FARP. other microbiologic analyses should still be performed to determine the specific pathogens that are more likely to be discordant when BAL and NP FARPs are compared. if a pathogen was already identified with an NP FARP, performance of a FARP on a BAL specimen is unlikely to provide additional microbiologic information."}
