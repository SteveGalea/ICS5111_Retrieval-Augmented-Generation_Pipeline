{"summary": "Fig. 1 shows the cumulative number of Ebola cases during the 2014\u201316 western African outbreak in western africa. the cumulative cases during the initial growth phase form an approximately linear relationship with time in log-linear scale. thus, in linear scale, the number of deaths increases exponentially with time. ( 1,0,0,0 ) is a disease-free equilibrium representing a completely susceptible population. the equations for E and I are decoupled, and become d E d t = E + I, d I d t = E I. the exponential growth rate is an important measure for the speed of spread of an infectious disease. the disease can invade a population if the growth rate is positive, and cannot invade if it is negative. 2.1. The parametric approach For the parametric approach, we need an underlying model that gives both the growth rate and R 0. Example 3 Consider the SIR model (1) in Example 1. Note that ( 1,0,0 ) is an disease free equilibrium representing a completely susceptible population. wallinga and Lipsitch developed a non-parametric method to infer the basic reproduction number from the exponential growth rate without assuming a model. a random individual remain infectious a time units after being infected (i.e., a is the infection age); a = (a) is the rate of transmission at the infection age a, assuming that the whole population is susceptible. w ( a ) is the probability density function of the generation time, i.e., the time from being infected to generate a secondary infection. this generation time is also called the serial interval. at the beginning of an epidemic, where the epidemic grows exponentially. Equation (5) links the exponential growth rate to the basic reproduction number though the serial interval distribution only. if we can estimate the serial interval distribution and the exponential growth rate independently, that we can infer the basic reproduction number. the moment generating function is M ( x ) = x. then R 0 = 1 M ( ) = + =. a more complex example with multiple infected states. if both distributions are exponential, the serial interval distribution is the convolution of the latent period distribution and the infectious period distribution. if both distributions are exponential, the serial interval distribution is the convolution of the latent period distribution and the infectious period distribution. example 4 Lets consider the SEIR model (3) in Example 2. The basic reproduction number is R 0 = /. if the mean infectious period 1 / and the mean latent period 1 / can be independently estimated on, then determines, and thus determines R 0. 2.2. c ( t ) d t is the number of new infections during the time interval [ t, t + d t ], that is, c ( t ) is the incidence rate, and S ( t ) is the average susceptibility of the population, i.e., the expected susceptibility of a randomly selected individual. c ( t ) = 0 c ( t a ) d a. the serial interval distribution w ( t ), c ( t ) = R 0 S ( t ) 0 c ( t ) w ( a ) d a. this means that the c ( t ) is only determined by R 0, w ( t ) and S ( t ). the probability that an infected individual remains infectious a time units after being infected is (a ) = 1 F ( a ). the serial interval distribution is w ( a ) = 1 F ( a ) d t = 1 F ( a ) d t = 1 F ( a ) d t = 1 F ( a ) d t = 1 F ( a ). the serial interval distribution is w (a ) = 0 a 1 F ( a l ) d G ( l ) d l 0 0 a [ 1 F ( a l ) ] G'( l ) d l d a. if both distributions are exponential, the serial interval distribution is the convolution of the latent period distribution and the infectious period distribution. Remark In Equation (4), R ( t ) = R 0 S ( t ) is the reproduction number. this equation can be used to estimate the production number at any time t during the epidemic given the incidence curve c ( t ), namely, R ( t ) = c ( t ) 0 c ( t a ) w (a ) d a. this is similar to, but different from, the nonparametric method we aim to find an exponential function f ( t ; c 0, ) = c 0 e t that minimizes its distance to the epidemic curve, i.e., the parameters = ( c 0, ). there are two commonly used methods to estimate the exponential growth rate. the nonlinear least squares method does not have an analytic solution. the linear least squares method does not have an analytic solution. we simulate an epidemic curve using the Gillespie method (Gillespie, 1976) the simulated daily cases are then aggregated into weekly cases. we use both methods to fit an exponential model to the simulated epidemic curve. the epidemic curve is simulated stochastically from the SEIR model in Example 2 using the Gillespie method (Gillespie, 1976) with the parameters = 0.3, = 1, = 0.2, E 0 = 10, S 0 = 9,990. I 0 = R 0 = 0. The rates have a time unit of a day, the daily cases are then aggregated by week. the least squares method implicitly assumes that the order of the observations does not matter, and that positive and negative deviations are equivalent. in statistics, the least squares method is commonly used in linear and nonlinear regression. however, these assumption on the errors may not be appropriate. the observation error is the error in the observation process. the process error originates from the stochasticity of the system that is independent to observation. the time that an infectious individual recovers, and the time that a susceptible individual is infected are all random variables that affect the number of new infections at any time. it is a common practice to maximize the log-likelihood function l ( ) = ln L ( ) = i = 0 n ln p i ( d i ; d i ; d i ; d i ; d i ; d i ; d i ; d i ; d i. negative binomial distribution has two parameters, the success probability q 0 and the shape parameter r > 0. For simplicity, we assume that the shape parameter r is the same at each time t i, and will; be estimated together with the model parameters. the last term can be ignored for the optimization problem. there is a constraint r > 0. 4.2. case 2: observation errors are negligible. the log-likelihood function is l ( ) = i = 0 n 1 ln e i i x i x i x i! = i = 0 n 1 x i + x i ln i ln x i! = i = 0 n 1 x i 1 e ( t i t i 1 ) + x i ( t a confidence interval with a confidence level is an interval that has a probability that contains the true parameter value. a commonly used confidence level is 95 %, which originates from a normal distribution. the probability that X [ 2, + 2 ] is 95 %. log-likelihood function l ( c 0, ) = i = 0 n ln p i ( d i ; ; ) = 0 n ln p i = 0 n ln p i = 0 n ln p i = 0 n ln p i = 0 n ln p i = 0 n ln p i a negative binomial distribution has two parameters, the success probability q 0 and the shape parameter r > 0. a negative binomial distribution has two parameters, the success probability q 0 and the shape parameter r > 0. a negative binomial distribution has two parameters, the success probability q 0 and the shape parameter r > 0. x i + r = i = 0 n 1 ln ( x i + r ) x i + r = i = 0 n 1 ln ( x i + r ) ln ( r ) + x i + r = i = 0 n 1 ln ( x i + r ) ln ( r ) + x i + r = i = 0 n 2, = i = 1 n 1 q i ( x i ; | x j j = 0 i 1 ). assume that X i + 1 is Poisson distribution with mean i + 1 = X i e ( t i + 1 t i ). a confidence interval is an interval that has a probability that contains the true parameter value. a value 0 is in the 95 % confidence interval is equivalent to accepting with 95 % probability that 0 is a possible growth rate. the statistics 2 ln = 2 are distributed with a degree of freedom 1. we can compare 2 ln with the 95 % quantile of the 2 distribution. we can thus determine if 0 should be in the confidence interval or not. the initial fraction of infectious individuals I ( 0 ) = I 0 (with the assumption that R ( 0 ) = 0, S ( 0 ) = 1 I 0, and thus I 0 determines the initial conditions), in addition to the population size N. so the log-likelihood function is (ignoring the constant terms) l (,, I 0, N ) = i = 0 n 1 c ( t i ) + x i ln realistic mechanistic models involve too many parameters that are at best difficult to estimate. a multi-group SIR model depends on a contact matrix consisting of transmission rates between groups. a simple phenomenological model can be used to describe the shape of the cumulative epidemic curve, but the model itself may not have realistic biological meaning. the logistic model has a fixed rate of slowing down of the exponential growth rate. the logistic model can be written as d d t C ( t ) = r C ( t ) [ 1 ( C ( t ) K 0 ) e r t K K C 0 ] 1 /. the predictions of the exponential model quickly decreases as more data points are used. both the logistic model and the Richards model give robust estimates. the prediction of the exponential model quickly decreases as more data points are used. logistic model Richards model coverage probability 43 % 65% That is, even though the logistic model gives a narrow confidence interval, its coverage probability is low. even though the logistic model gives a narrow confidence interval, its coverage probability is significantly lower than the confidence level. to construct the log-likelihood function, we need to calculate C ( t ), i.e., numerically solve the SIR model. the recovery rate, the initial fraction of infectious individuals I ( 0 ) = I 0. thus, the parameters of the model is = (, I 0, N ) simple SIR and SEIR models assume a population with a homogeneous susceptibility. however, realistic mechanistic models can be overly complicated. a multi-group SIR model depends on a contact matrix consisting of transmission rates between groups, which contains a large number of parameters if the model uses many groups. the new cases c ( t i ) in a time period [ t i, t i + 1 ] is thus c ( t i + 1 ) C ( t i + 1 ) is also given by (8). the logistic model has a fixed rate of slowing down of the exponential growth rate. the logistic model has a fixed rate of slowing down of the exponential growth rate. the logistic model can be written as d d t C ( t ) = r C ( t ) [ 1 ( C ( t ) K 0 ) [ C 0 + K C 0 ). e r t i, t i + 1 is given by (8). the parameters are = ( r, K, C 0, ). 5.3. Comparison of the models. we fit these models to the stochastically simulated SEIR epidemic curve of weekly cases that we introduced in Section 3. the logistic model and the logistic model give the narrowest confidence intervals. however, narrower confidence intervals may not be desirable if it has a large chance that it does not contain the true value. each realization of the underlying stochastic epidemic process yields a different epidemic curve. in this case ignoring the process error is appropriate."}
