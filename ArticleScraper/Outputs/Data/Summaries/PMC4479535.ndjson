affinity-purified antibody preparations showed an H1 neutralizing titre of 10, except for the hyper-immune sheep serum tested in the assay as a positive control. the epitope-specific antibody recognizes, but does not neutralize, the virus in vitro. the biological role of these antibodies, directed to internal proteins, is not clear. previous reports suggested non-neutralizing antibodies may decrease morbidity and lead to increased viral clearance through binding to Fc receptors. the pandemic HA exhibits conservation of most of the epitopes from the antigenic sites Cb, Sa and Sb compared with the HA of the 1918 Spanish flu. the epitope was recognized by serum immunoglobulin at both pre- and post-vaccination time-points. serum from these individuals also exhibited strong pre-existing IgG reactivity towards pandemic flu epitopes. this epitope represents a dominant response associated with repetitive flu vaccination. a rabbit mono-specific antibody was prepared that did not neutralize the pandemic flu in vitro. a 15-mer linear peptide that was used to immunize the rabbits does not resemble the same folding of this epitope within the native protein. differentially recognized epitopes by serum IgG from individuals (n = 19) post pandemic flu infection compared with epitopes recognized by serum IgG of individuals (n = 19) after Pandemrix\u00ae vaccination ( 6
