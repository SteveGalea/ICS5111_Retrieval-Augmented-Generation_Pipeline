{"summary": "inTRODUCTION Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) is a viral respiratory illness caused by MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which was first identified in 2012. the mortality rate of MERS is approximately 36%. no vaccine or specific treatment for MERS is currently available. coterminal nested structure carry the same leader sequence of 70 nucleotides at the 5\u2032 end (14\u201316) nsp1s of alpha and beta CoVs share a biological function to inhibit host gene expression. nsp1s of alpha and beta CoVs share a biological function to inhibit host gene expression. mechanisms of nsp1-induced host gene suppression have been well characterized in severe respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) nsp1 is a cytoplasmic protein that binds to the 40S ribosome subunit (40, 41) and inactivates its translation function, which leads to translation inhibition. the SARS-CoV nsp1-40S ribosome complex also induces endonucleolytic cleavage of host mRNA nsp1 of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus suppresses type II IFN (48) the biological roles of nsp1 in coV replication are not well understood (39\u201341, 46, 52, 53) the biological roles of nsp1 in coV replication are not well understood. sp1 (193 amino acids) would disrupt the MERS-CoV nsp1's host gene suppression functions. we hypothesized that K181A mutation in MERS-CoV nsp1 would disrupt the host gene suppression functions. we transfected 293 cells with capped and polyadenylated RNA transcripts encoding MERS-CoV nsp1 with K181A mutation. 293 cells were transfected with 2 g of capped and polyadenylated RNA transcripts encoding CAT, SARS-CoV nsp1, MERS-CoV nsp1-WT, MERS-CoV nsp1-CD, or MERS-CoV nsp1-mt. rRNAs were extracted at 9 h posttransfection and subject to Northern blot analysis using a probe for GAPDH 293 cells were cotransfected with a plasmid encoding Ren-EMCV-FF. plasmid expressing CAT, SARS-CoV nsp1, MERS-CoV nsp1-WT, or MERS-CoV nsp1-mt protein. all nsp1s carried the C-terminal myc tag. 293 cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding CAT, MERS-CoV nsp1-WT, MERS-CoV nsp1-CD or MERS-CoV nsp1-mt. all expressed proteins carried a C-terminal myc tag. SARS-CoV nsp1 was more active than MERS-CoV nsp1-WT. the RNA fragment was absent in cells expressing the MERS-CoV nsp1-mt. Western blat analysis confirmed expression of SARS-CoV nsp1-mt. all three viruses replicated efficiently with similar replication kinetics in vero cells. all of the viruses accumulated similar levels of viral structural proteins, S, M, and N, nsp1 and virus-specific mRNAs at each indicated time point. the abundance of host GAPDH mRNA was lower in MERS-CoV-WT-infected cells than in MERS-CoV-CD- and MERS-CoV-mt-infected cells. nsp1 suppressed host gene expression by inducing host mRNA decay and inhibiting host translation in infected cells. vero cells were either mock infected (Mock) or infected with MERS-CoV-WT (WT), MERS-CoV-CD (CD) or MERS-CoV-mt (mt) at an MOI of 3. at 16 h p.i. (A) or 24 h p.i. (B, left panel), intracellular RNAs were extracted. the titer of MERS-CoV-WT was statistically 10-fold higher at peak titers than those of the mutant viruses at an MOI of 0.01. both mutant viruses replicated less efficiently than MERS-CoV-WT in 293/CD26 cells at an MOI of 0.01. fected with MERS-CoV-WT, MERS-CoV-CD (CD) or MERS-CoV-mt (mt) at an MOI of 0.01 or an MOI of 3. titers were determined by plaque assay in vero cells. each bar represents the mean ( the standard deviation) for three samples. infected 293/CD26 cells were either mock infected (M) or infected with MERS-CoV-WT, MERS-CoV-CD (CD) or MERS-CoV-mt at an MOI of 3. expression levels of the genes were normalized to levels of 18S rRNA. each bar represents the mean ( the standard deviation for three wells) mRNAs were detected by Northern blotting using a probe that binds to the 3\u2032 end of the MERS-CoV genome. expression levels were normalized to levels of 18s rRNA. each bar represents the mean ( the standard deviation) for three wells. accumulation of viral mRNAs was marginally higher in MERS-CoV-WT-infected cells than in cells infected with mutant viruses. replication of both mutant viruses did not affect abundance of GAPDH mRNA. abundance of GAPDH mRNA was substantially reduced in MERS-CoV-WT-infected cells. the 28S and 18S rRNAs were detected by ethidium bromide staining. cells were radiolabeled for 1 h with Tran35S-label. cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. 293/CD26 cells were infected with MERS-CoV-WT (WT), MERS-CoV-CD (CD) or MERS-CoV-mt (mt) at an MOI of 3. the results represent the averages of three independent experiments. each bar represents the mean ( the standard deviation for three samples) expression might have effectively suppressed CD26 expression in infected cells. replication of the three viruses did not affect levels of CD26 at 24 h p.i. however, it caused a reduction in CD26 abundance at 36 h p.i. ation is believed to be caused by radiolytic cleavage or cross-linking of genetic material. we performed transmission electron microscopic analysis of infected 293/CD26 cells. to further understand the mechanism of inefficient replication of mutant viruses, we performed transmission electron microscopic analysis of infected 293/CD26 cells. electron microscopy of 293/CD26 cells infected with MERS-CoV-WT (A), -CD (B) or -mt (C) showed low titers of cell-associated viruses. this resulted in low number of virus particles (Fig. 8A) and the release of a low number of virus particles. alanine substitutions of two charged amino acid residues abolish translation inhibition function and endonucleolytic RNA cleavage function. we hypothesized that alanine substitution of a charged amino acid residue near the C-terminal region of MERS-CoV nsp1 would also disrupt the MERS-CoV nsp1's host gene suppression functions. cells were radiolabeled with Tran35S-label from 8.5 to 9.5 h posttransfection. expression of SARS-CoV nsp1, MERS-CoV nsp1-WT suppressed host protein synthesis. expression of CAT, SARS-CoV nsp1, MERS-CoV nsp1-WT, MERS-CoV nsp1-CD, and MERS-CoV nsp 293 cells were transfected with RNA transcripts as described in panel A. intracellular RNAs were extracted at 9 h posttransfection and subjected to Northern blot analysis using a probe for GAPDH mRNA. the 28S and 18S rRNAs were detected by ethidium bromide staining. 293 cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding CAT, MERS-CoV nsp1-WT, or MERS-CoV nsp1-mt. mERS-CoV nsp1-mt did not induce the endonucleolytic RNA cleavage to GAPDH mRNA and subsequent mRNA degradation. expression of MERS-CoV nsp1-WT and SARS-CoV nsp1-WT induced endonucleolytic cleavage of Ren-EMCV-FF RNA. RNA fragment was absent in cells expressing the MERS-CoV nsp1-mt. nsp1-CD suppressed host translation. the absence of host translation inhibition in cells expressing MERS-CoV nsp1-mt demonstrated that MERS-CoV nsp1-mt lost both the RNA cleavage function and the translation suppression function. to explore the role of nsp1 in virus replication and host gene expression, we rescued MERS-CoV-WT encoding mutant nsp1. total proteins were extracted by using anti-MERS-CoV S, M, N, nsp1 and tubulin antibody. mRNAs were detected by Northern blotting using a probe that binds to the 3\u2032 end of the MERS-CoV genome. the abundance of host GAPDH mRNA was lower in MERS-CoV-WT-infected cells than in MERS-CoV-CD- and MERS-CoV-mt-inf nsp1 suppressed host gene expression by inducing host mRNA decay and inhibiting host translation in infected cells. vero cells were either mock infected (Mock) or infected with MERS-CoV-WT, MERS-CoV-CD (CD) or MERS-CoV-mt (mt) at an MOI of 3. the three viruses replicated efficiently and similarly at an MOI of 3 in Huh-7 cells, a well-differentiated hepatocyte-derived cellular carcinoma cell line (56), except that the titer of MERS-CoV-WT was statistically 10-fold higher at peak titers than those of the mutants at 32 h p.i. both mutant viruses replicated less efficiently than MERS-CoV-WT in 293/CD26 cells at an MOI of 0.01 nsp1 promoted virus replication in a cell type-dependent manner. asterisks represent statically significant differences between the titers of MERS-CoV-WT and mutant viruses (P 0.05) mRNAs from 8 h to 32 h p.i. suggest inefficient replication of mutant viruses was not due to induction of type I and III IFNs. the host gene suppression functions of MERS-CoV nsp1 did not play a significant role in inhibiting the induction of IFN- and IFN- mRNAs in 293/CD26 cells. mRNA 1 of MERS-CoV-WT accumulated higher abundance than that of MERS-CoV-mt at 8 h p.i. mRNA 1 of MERS-CoV-WT accumulated higher abundance than that of MERS-CoV-mt at 8 h p.i. the amount of mRNA 8 of MERS-CoV-WT was higher than those of mutant viruses at 8 and 32 h p.i. these studies showed that there was a trend that MERS-CoV-WT accumulated higher levels of viral mRNAs than the mutant viruses. effects of nsp1 for host mRNA stability and host protein synthesis in infected 293/CD26 cells were examined next. 293/CD26 cells were either mock-infected (Mock) or infected with MERS-CoV-WT (WT), MERS-CoV-CD (CD) or MERS-CoV-mt (mt) at an MOI of 3. abundance of GAPDH mRNA at 24 h p.i. was determined using northern blot analysis. low titers of cell-free and cell-associated viruses in mutant viruses suggest that the release of infectious viruses was not selectively inhibited in the mutant viruses. these data implied that the low titers of cell-free viruses in the mutant viruses were due to the accumulation of low titers of cell-associated viruses. soluble CD26 binds to MERS-CoV particles and neutralizes virus infectivity. expressed CD26 might have bound to intracellular virus particles. soluble CD26 binds to MERS-CoV particles and neutralizes virus infectivity. the amounts of virus particles released from mutant virus-infected cells were lower than those released from mutant virus-infected cells. virus inactivation by gamma irradiation is believed to be caused by radiolytic cleavage or cross-linking of genetic material. mutant viruses were able to accumulate viral structural proteins as efficiently as MERS-CoV-WT in 293/CD26 cells (Fig. 6A) this resulted in low titers of cell-associated viruses (Fig. 8A) and the release of a low number of virus particles (Fig. 4C) expressed MERS-CoV nsp1 suppresses host gene expression by inducing endonucleolytic cleavage of host mRNAs and inhibiting translation. existing data suggest that MERS-CoV nsp1 and SARS-CoV nsp1 exert these functions by different mechanisms. SARS-CoV nsp1-mt is deficient for binding to 40S ribosomes (40) nsp1 nsp1 interacts with the 40S ribosome through its C-terminal region. it is possible that both MERS-CoV nsp1 and SARS-CoV nsp1 access target host protein/factors through their C-terminal regions. mERS-CoV mutant lacking all accessory genes induced higher levels of IFN- and IFN-3 mRNAs than wt MERS-CoV in Calu-3 2B4 cells. nsp1-induced changes in translational activities differed between infected vero cells and infected 293/CD26 cells. p1 played a significant role in translational suppression in vero cells. moderate level of host translation inhibition could be due to induction of cellular stress response to virus infection. nsp1 did not play a significant role in virus-induced translation suppression. data showed less efficient intracellular virus particle accumulation in mutant virus-infected cells than in MERS-CoV-WT-infected cells. low levels of virus particle accumulation in mutant virus-infected cells caused low titers of cell-associated viruses and cell-free viruses. vage function of the MERS-CoV nsp1 selectively suppressed E protein expression in mutant virus-infected 293/CD26 cells. similar translational activities in MERS-CoV-WT- and mutant virus-infected 293/CD26 cells did not support a possibility of selective inhibition of E protein accumulation. a plausible reason for the efficient replication of mutant viruses in vero and Calu-3 cells may be that these cells express the putative virus restriction protein at low levels. tetherin has been known as a host restriction factor capable of impeding the release of multiple viruses, including CoV (65\u201369) nsp1 represents the first viral protein whose RNA cleavage-inducing function promotes virus assembly/budding. nsp1 represents the first viral protein whose RNA cleavage-inducing function promotes virus assembly/budding. 293/CD26 cells were generated by transfecting pCAGGS-CD26-BlasticidinR into 293 cells (ATCC) and subsequent incubation of the transfected cells in the presence of blasticidin (12 g/ml) all virus strains were passaged once in Vero cells and used for infection studies. pCAGGS-CAT, -SARS-CoV nsp1, -MERS-CoV nsp1-WT, and -MERS-CoV nsp1-CD all carried a C-terminal myc tag. pRL-EMCV-FL expressing a reporter mRNA carrying the EMCV IRES between the upstream rLuc gene and the downstream fLuc gene was used. subconfluent 293 cells were transfected with in vitro-synthesized RNA transcripts encoding CAT, SARS-CoV nsp1, MERS-CoV nsp1-WT, MERS-CoV nsp1-CD, or MERS-CoV nsp1-mt. the cells were metabolically labeled with 20 Ci of Tran35S-label (1,000 Ci/mmol; Perkin- whole-cell lysates were prepared and subjected to Western blot analysis. anti-myc antibody (Millipore), anti-tubulin antibody (Calbiochem) or antibodies against each of MERS-CoV protein described above were used as primary antibodies. cDNAs were synthesized by using a MERS-CoV gene-specific primer (5\u2032-TTTTTTTTCTAATCAGTTAACATCAATCATTGG-3\u2032) the primers used for human IFN- mRNA were 5\u2032-AAGGCCAAGGAGTACAGTC-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-ATCTTCAGTTTVGGAGGTAA-3\u2032 (reverse) the primers used for 18S rRNA were 5\u2032-CCGGTACAGTGAAACTGCGAATG-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-ACCACAGAGTGAGAAAGGT-3\u2032 (reverse) the relative expression level of each gene mRNA was normal supernatants from 293/CD26 cells infected with MERS-CoV-WT, -CD or \u2013mt were irradiated with 2 106 rads from a Gammacell 60Co source. inactivation of virus infectivity was confirmed by blind passages on the samples in vero cells two times. the monolayers were washed in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.3) for 1 h. the pellets were postfixed in 1% OsO4 in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.3) the cells were scraped off and processed further as a pellet. virus strains were passaged once in vero cells and used for infection studies. the presence of the expected mutation and absence of other mutations in nsp1 was confirmed prior to using these viruses. pCAGGS-MERS-CoV nsp1-mt was generated from pCAGGS-MERS-CoV nsp1 by using a recombinant PCR-based method. pRL-EMCV-FL expressing a bicistronic reporter mRNA carrying the EMCV IRES between the upstream rLuc gene and the downstream fLuc gene was used. subconfluent 293 cells were transfected with in vitro-synthesized capped and polyadenylated RNA transcripts encoding CAT, SARS-CoV nsp1, MERS-CoV nsp1-WT, MERS-CoV nsp1-CD or MERS-CoV nsp1-mt. all encoded proteins carried the C-terminal myc tag. tagged MERS-CoV-WT, MERS-CoV-CD, or MERS-CoV-mt were infected at an MOI of 3. whole-cell lysates were prepared and subjected to Western blot analysis. anti-myc antibody (Millipore), anti-tubulin antibody (Calbiochem) or antibodies against each of MERS-CoV protein described above were used as primary antibodies. total RNA extraction and qRT-PCR the primers used for human IFN- mRNA were 5\u2032-AAGGCCAAGGAGTACAGTC-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-ATCTTCAGTTTVGGAGGTAA-3\u2032 (reverse), the primers used for 18S rRNA were 5\u2032-CCGGTACAGTGAAACTGCGAATG-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-ACCACAGAGTGAAAGGT-3\u2032 (reverse) the relative expression level of each gene mRNA was normalized supernatants from 293/CD26 cells infected with MERS-CoV-WT, -CD or \u2013mt were irradiated with 2 106 rads from a Gammacell 60Co source. inactivation of virus infectivity was confirmed by blind passages on the samples in vero cells two times. the monolayers were washed in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.3) the cells were scraped off and processed further as a pellet. the pellets were postfixed in 1% OsO4 in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer."}
