{"summary": "an inoculum of 103 plaque forming units (PFU) persisted on polyfluorotetraethylene (Teflon; PTFE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), ceramic tiles, glass, and stainless steel for at least 5 days. Approximately 103 PFU HuCoV-229E (20 l infected-cell lysate) was applied to 1-cm2 coupons of test surface materials and incubated at ambient conditions (21\u00b0C; relative humidity, coronavirus was inactivated in 40 min on brasses and 120 min on copper nickels containing less than 70% copper. the same inoculum was applied as 1 l/cm2, was dried immediately to simulate fingertip touch contamination. the inactivation time was reduced further in the rapidly drying fingertip contamination model by approximately 8-fold to 5 min for C26000 cartridge brass. copper nickel C72500 was less effective than C70600. at a lower percentage of copper, the cartridge brass was far superior to copper nickel C71500, inactivating virus in approximately one-third the time. the presence of copper nickel C70600 resulted in increased efficacy compared to that of copper nickel C72500. chelators of Cu(II) and Cu(I) initially protected the virus from inactivation for up to 2 h. both ionic species of copper are required directly and/or indirectly for virus inactivation. this suggests that both ionic species of copper are required for virus inactivation. both chelators protected coronavirus from inactivation on copper and brass surfaces. however, d-mannitol gave minimum protection on copper but prolonged protection on brass surfaces. this suggests that copper ions are the main moieties responsible for inactivation of coronavirus on 100% copper surfaces. this suggests that generation of hydroxyl radicals becomes more significant as the concentration of copper in the alloy is reduced. EDTA, BCS, d-mannitol, and Tiron did not significantly affect the virus on stainless steel control surfaces or in suspension. inactivation of coronavirus on copper and copper alloy surfaces results in fragmentation of the viral genome. a one-step reverse transcriptase real-time quantitative PCR (RTqPCR) was performed to detect a 139-bp region of ORF1 within nonstructural protein 4 (nsp4). the total amount of intact RNA was reduced at 4 h, possibly due to drying damage as seen in panel A. the same procedure was used with mock-infected cells, revealing the same pattern of RNA breakdown following application to copper surfaces. exposure to copper surfaces results in morphological changes to human coronavirus particles visible in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) cell lysate preparations were spread over coupons of the test surface and incubated at room temperature. the virus was removed from the coupons and assayed for infectious virus. dilutions were prepared in growth medium and 2-mm-diameter glass beads. 1-ml aliquots were plated onto confluent monolayers of MRC-5 cells. plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 4 to 7 days. purified RNA fragments were separated on a nondenaturing 1% agarose gel. gelRed binds to single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) approximately half as much as to double-stranded nucleic acid. gels were observed and photographed using GeneSnap software. the virus band was resuspended in water and the virus pelleted at 77,000 g for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. the supernatant was discarded, the tubes were allowed to drain, and the final pellet was resuspended in ice-cold nuclease-free deionized distilled water."}
