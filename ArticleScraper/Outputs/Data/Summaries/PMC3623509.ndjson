{"summary": "a group of pediatric infectious disease specialists, physicians in infectious diseases, veterinarians, medical scientists, and basic scientists gathered together to establish a society in which vaccine or vaccinology-related research activities can be shared. the review will start off from records of the outbreak of infectious disease in the Joseon Dynasty and cover vaccination-related works in Korea in modern history and review the objectives and directions of current vaccination policies in South Korea. people claim that the Joseon Dynasty is called \"the dynasty of communicable infectious diseases\" many infectious diseases were rampant at that time. in china, rudimentary inoculation of Duibub and Bimeobbub was invented in 16th century. in 1800, Yak-Yong Chung introduced vaccination for the first time in Korea during the Joseon Dynasty. in his book, Magawhetong, he introduced Jenner's vaccination in supplement section. also found inoculating methods using collecting pus from a patient with smallpox from Kangheejajeon in Beijing, China. in 1900, the Hansung (old name of Seoul) Vaccination Recommendation was established and distributed. the vaccination saved many lives by preventing smallpox during this period. in 1912, the vaccine started to be produced in the department of bacteriology. in 1912, cholera, smallpox vaccine were produced in the Ministry of Agriculture and the Forestry Rinderpest Serum Manufactory. in 1926, eight vaccines include anthrax, rinderpest were produced in the General of Korea Serum Manufactory of the Japanese Governor-General of Korea. the name of vaccine producing organization was changed to the Korea Veterinary Service Laboratory of the Japanese Governor-General of Korea. cholera vaccine in 1963, measles vaccine inoculation and time table of vaccination were made in 1965. cholera vaccine in 1961, measles vaccine in 1963, measles vaccine inoculation and time table of vaccination were made in 1965. pediatric vaccination schedule has been revised 8 times since 1966. the goal of vaccination policy and direction is to know the evolution of the modern vaccination in this country. the origin of the Korea Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention at the present time can be found at the health administration installed by the Edict of King Gojong in 1894. in 2002, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in southern china spread around the world and resulted in a lot of casualties and economic loss. health budget and management would be made by publishing a white book or a government report in 2004. the national immunization program was based on evidence. fourteen infectious diseases belong to the national immunization program. the national expanded vaccination program was developed to increase vaccination rate in Korea. the current doses of vaccination including hospitals and public health care center are 16,700,000 doses. the proportion of vaccination rate is 35% for public health centers and 65% for private sector. the proportion ratio dropped in public health centers by 55%. the rate rose by 239% in private clinics and hospitals. the computerized registration and report rate jumped up to 91.8% from 78.2%. a nationwide measles vaccination program took place in 2001 on 5,700,000 students (elementary 2nd grade to high school 1st grade) in an effort to maintain over 95% vaccination rate, a nationwide measles vaccination program took place on 5,700,000 students (elementary 2nd grade to high school 1st grade) the national expanded vaccination program was developed to increase vaccination rate in Korea. the current doses of vaccination including hospitals and public health care center are estimated to be near 20,000,000 doses considering the low report rate of private clinics and hospitals. the trial of the expanded vaccination program was implemented in Daegu City and Gunpo City in July to December 2005. the proportion ratio dropped in public health centers by 55%, whereas the rate rose by 239% in private clinics and hospitals. the computerized registration and report rate jumped up to 91.8% from 78.2%. a nationwide measles vaccination program took place in 2001 on 5,700,000 students. it announced eradication of the disease based on WHO standards in November 2006. the goal for managing influenza is decreasing morbidity and mortality rate to achieve reduced disease burden. biochemical characteristics of vaccines compared to those in the past 30 years. biochemical characteristics of vaccines compared to those in the past 30 years."}
