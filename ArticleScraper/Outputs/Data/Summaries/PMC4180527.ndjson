{"summary": "the annual economic losses due to PRRS are estimated to be $664 million in the US (1). PRRS is characterized by both respiratory and reproductive abnormalities (2\u20134). major losses from reproductive failure associated with stillbirths, mummifications, weak born piglets and high preweaning mortality (5\u20137) tranasal route shows suppression of innate NK cell cytotoxic function and IFN- production (12\u201314), weak and delayed cell-mediated and virus neutralizing antibody responses (15,16), associated with prolonged immunosuppression (17). intranasal co-administration of PRRS-MLV with a suitable mucosal adjuvant can overcome the vaccine induced immunosuppression with concomitant increase in host innate and adaptive immune responses. pigs were vaccinated (PRRS-MLV+ Mtb WCL) and challenged with PRRSV. pigs were tested to confirm absence of PRRSV antibodies by ELISA. pigs received food and water ad libitum. pigs (n=4) were euthanized together prior euthanizing any virus challenged animals. pig tissue samples were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and processed into paraffin blocks. three m sections were cut and stained with haematoxylin and eosin as described previously. cell proliferation data was analyzed by FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc. OR) to obtain the proliferation index (PI) of each sample. the PI denotes the average number of cell divisions the responding lymphocytes underwent after subtracting from the background (initial population of cells at generation \u20180\u2019). circovirus type 2 were used in the study. pigs received food and water ad libitum. all inoculations including PRRSV challenge was performed by intranasal delivery. the lung sections were examined in a blindfolded fashion by a board certified veterinary pathologist to determine the lung lesion scores by virus-induced pathology. cells were washed and stained with an irreversible cytosolic dye. cell proliferation data was analyzed by FlowJo software. the PI denotes the average number of cell divisions the responding lymphocytes underwent after subtracting from the background (initial population of cells at generation \u20180\u2019). pigs administered with a potent mucosal adjuvant, Mtb WCL, did not show a significant difference between vaccinated and unvaccinated groups. pigs were unvaccinated or vaccinated with PRRS-MLV plus Mtb WCL. reduced gross lung pathology and significantly reduced viremia were attributed to adjuvant mediated innate and PRRSV specific adaptive immune responses. pigs were stained with H&E: (i) mock pigs; (ii) pigs unvaccinated and challenged with MN184. the cell-mediated immunity against virus infections is contributed by different lymphocyte subsets, in particular by CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and activated Th/memory CD4+CD8+ T cells (19,32). however, knowledge related to the status of CD8+ lymphocytes in the lungs of infected pigs is limited. pigs were unvaccinated or vaccinated (PRRS-MLV+Mtb WCL) and challenged with MN184. LMNC were stained with CFSE and restimulated with killed PRRSV antigens. PBMC were first gated for cells immunostained with R-phycoerythrine-conjugated pig specific CD8+ antibody. a large amount of pulmonary NO\u2019 is produced by the epithelial lung inducible nitric oxide synthase (41), which acts on L-arginine to produce NO\u2019. levels of NO\u2019 production in the lungs of pigs received adjuvanted vaccine and challenged with virulent PRRSV MN184 at DPCs 30 and 60 was detected. the absence of NO\u2019 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of a mild PRRSV strain SD23983 infected pigs (43) and production of inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS) in alveolar macrophages (44). however, pulmonary epithelial cells in the respiratory viral infections contribute significantly in the production of NO\u2019 (45). early lung viral clearance, activation of virus specific immune cells, early virus neutralizing antibody generation, increased Th1 and reduced immunosuppressive cytokine production (22). pigs vaccinated and MN184 challenged reduced microscopic lesions, increased proliferation of virus specific CD8+ T cells, and enhanced NO\u2019 production were detected."}
