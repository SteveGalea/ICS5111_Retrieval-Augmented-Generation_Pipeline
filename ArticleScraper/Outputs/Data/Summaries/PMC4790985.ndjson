{"summary": "two scaffolds (scaffold95 and scaffold222) corresponding to the partial type I IFN locus were identified in the P. alecto whole-genome sequence (21). the scaffolds span 25.14 Mb and 4.344 Mb, respectively, and each contains type I IFN genes. however, these scaffolds did not overlap and therefore did not cover the entire type I IFN locus. the size of the IFN locus ranged from 25 kb in fish to 1 Mb in pig. the only two exceptions were chicken and bat, both of which have shorter IFN loci of 30 kb and 250 kb. the pattern of a single copy of IFN- and IFN- is conserved across all species (8). bats have the fewest IFN- family members compared with any other mammalian genome studied. the prediction was performed as published by Thomas et al. (53) the bat IFN locus contains eight additional IFN- loci that appear to be pseudogenes (IFN-P) this number is larger compared with humans or mice, which each have five IFN-Ps. qRT-PCR detection of IFN- and IFN- mRNA expression in 12 P. alecto tissues (n = 3) (A) was used to infect PaKiT03 cells. IFN- and IFN- mRNA expression was detected 6 h post infection. qRT-PCR detection of IFN- and IFN- mRNA expression in five C. brachyotis tissues (n = 2). the expression level was normalized to housekeeping gene actin. two bat viruses and a mouse paramyxovirus infect paKiT03 cells. both are bat-borne viruses carried by Pteropus bats. the absence of IFN- induction is likely the result of antagonism. the constitutive expression of IFN- in bats is not associated with active viral infection. in human cells, continuous IFN- exposure has been shown to lead to steady-state induction of the U-ISGF3\u2013dependent proteins, with no sustained increase in other IFN-induced proteins. 40.5% (17 of 42) of ISGF3-dependent ISGs showed higher expression in human compared with bat cells. only 33.3% (14 of 42) were higher expression in bat cells. expression of subset of genes up-regulated in either bat or human cells was validated. IFN-2 and IFN-3 displayed a similar expression pattern across most organs. the expression was normalized to the housekeeping gene 18S rRNA. the expression was normalized to the housekeeping gene 18S rRNA. modules I and III were conserved with functional human IFN- genes. module II was identical to that of human IFN-2, which is nonfunctional. promoter assays demonstrated that only IFN-1 and IFN-3 responded to IRF3 and IRF7. plasmids encoding the three individual IFN- ORFs were transfected into human HEK293T cells. the human IFN-R cannot respond to bat IFN and trigger downstream signaling (Fig. S6) all three IFN- proteins successfully induced ISGs. conditioned media from HEK293T cells transfected with plasmids encoding pCAGGS-GFP (lane 1), pcDNA6.2/C-emGFP\u2013IFN-1 (lane 2), -IFN-2 (lane 3), or -IFN- (lane 5) were evaluated by immunoblotting with anti-GFP antibody. the difference in ISG induction in response to IFN- was calculated in comparison with ISG induction by each of the three individual IFN- proteins (*P 0.05). the difference in ISG induction in response to IFN- was calculated in comparison with each of the individual IFN- proteins (*P 0.05). two scaffolds (scaffold95 and scaffold222) corresponding to the partial type I IFN locus were identified in the P. alecto whole-genome sequence (21). the scaffolds span 25.14 Mb and 4.344 Mb, respectively, and each contains type I IFN genes. the size of the IFN locus ranged from 25 kb in fish to 1 Mb in pig. the only two exceptions were chicken and bat, both of which have shorter IFN loci of 30 kb and 250 kb respectively. a single copy of IFN- and IFN- genes was found on a separate scaffold in the P. alecto genome (scaffold 14) the pattern of a single copy of IFN- and IFN- is conserved across all species (8). the prediction was performed as published by Thomas et al. (53) the bat IFN locus contains eight IFN- loci that appear to be pseudogenes (IFN-P) this number is larger compared with humans or mice, which each have five IFN-Ps. qRT-PCR detection of IFN- and IFN- mRNA expression in 12 P. alecto tissues (n = 3) (A) qRT-PCR detection of IFN- and IFN- mRNA expression was detected 6 h post infection. data illustrate average normalized fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM) across four RNAseq replicates in paKiT03 cells compared with HEK293T cells. qRT-PCR detection of IFN- and IFN- mRNA expression in five C. brachyotis tissues. we used two bat viruses and a mouse paramyxovirus to infect paKiT03 cells. both are bat-borne viruses carried by Pteropus bats. the absence of IFN- induction is likely the result of antagonism. bat cells failed to detect IFN- in either cell line. no transcripts showed significant homology to known viruses or microbes. the constitutive expression of IFN- in bats is not associated with active viral infection. only 23.0% of ISGF3-dependent ISGs showed higher expression in human compared with bat cells. the highest expression in bats included well-known antiviral proteins including bone marrow stromal cell antigen 2 (BST2) and Mx1. IFN-2 and IFN-3 displayed a similar expression pattern across most organs. the expression was normalized to the housekeeping gene 18S rRNA. the expression was normalized to the housekeeping gene 18S rRNA. three modules were identified in bat IFN-1 and IFN-3. modules I and III were conserved with those of functional human IFN- genes. module II was identical to that of human IFN-2, which is nonfunctional. plasmids encoding the three individual IFN- ORFs were transfected into human HEK293T cells. the human IFN-R cannot respond to bat IFN and trigger downstream signaling (Fig. S6) all three IFN- proteins successfully induced ISGs. conditioned media from HEK293T cells transfected with plasmids encoding pCAGGS-GFP (lane 1), pcDNA6.2/C-emGFP\u2013IFN-1 (lane 2), -IFN-2 (lane 5) were evaluated by immunoblotting with anti-GFP antibody. cells were collected for qRT-PCR detection of mRNA expression of IRF7, Mx1 and OAS1. the difference in ISG induction in response to IFN- was calculated in comparison with ISG induction by each of the three individual IFN- proteins (*P 0.05). the contraction of the IFN locus appears to have occurred after the divergence of bats from ungulates 80 Mya (38) the presence of eight IFN- pseudogenes provides further evidence for the contraction of the bat IFN locus from a large IFN- family in the ancestral bat genome. the three functional bat IFN- genes experienced positive selection at the ancestral branch, suggesting host\u2013pathogen antagonism has continued through the long coevolutionary history of bats and viruses. in humans, IFN-1 mRNA is detectible in healthy spleen, liver, and kidney, but not in other organs. the human IFN- response peaks at 2, 8, and 12 h following SeV infection. in bats, the IFN- response is constitutively activated and further induced 8\u20139 h post infection (25). the two layers of the response are anticipated to provide bats with immediate protection. these ISGs were previously annotated, thus confirming they are counterparts to the corresponding human genes (21). Among the ISGs are well-characterized intracellular antiviral factors BST-2 (tetherin), which has been reported to restrict replication of HIV, Ebola, and Marburg viruses. such ISGs may provide a \u201cswitched-on\u201d defense mechanism to blunt virus replication and potentially viral pathogenesis in bats. bats use fewer IFN- genes to efficiently perform the functions of as many as 13 IFN-s in other species. the constitutive expression pattern of IFN- in bats may provide bats with a highly effective system for controlling viral replication. paKiT03 cells were mock-infected or infected with HeV, Sendai virus, or PulV as described in SI Methods.
