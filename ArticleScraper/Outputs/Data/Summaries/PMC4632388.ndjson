{"summary": "viruses have evolved a myriad of strategies to manipulate the host cell environment to one that is conducive for virus replication. the majority of viroporins described are small (less than 120 amino acids) and contain one or two transmembrane domains (TMD), although a small number of larger viroporins have been shown to encode up to three putative TMD [3]. viroporins can manipulate a wide range of cellular processes from autophagy [13,14,15], trafficking [16,17], inflammation [18,19] to cell survival [20]. viroporin function has been shown to assist in all stages of the virus life cycle including entry, membrane penetration, genome replication and virus egress [1,2]. polyomaviruses The polyomaviridae are small, non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses that infect a wide range of species. the family was named after the founding member, polyomavirus, which caused \u201cmany tumors\u201d in mice [34], followed by the prototypic primate polyomavirus, Simian Vacuolating agent 40 (SV40), from the rhesus monkey [35]. the first two agnoprotein is only expressed by a limited number of polyomaviruses including the related BK and SV40. agnoprotein is highly basic and contains a central hydrophobic region capable of forming an amphipathic helix. residues 30-37 within the amphipathic helix are necessary and sufficient for dimer and oligodendrocytes. agnoprotein oligomers are stable in SDS and do not depend on disulphide bridge formation. the basic nature of the protein may provide flexibility within the amino and carboxyl termini increasing the range of interactions with host partners. agnoprotein interacts with the sub-unit of adaptor protein complex 3. substitution of two basic amino acids prevented interaction with AP-3. agnoprotein abrogated the plasma membrane permeabilization seen with the wild type protein. reduced agnoprotein expression is a feature observed in some agnoprotein deletion viruses. JC has evolved to alter the nuclear envelope (NE) to mediate virus egress. agnoprotein has been shown to be subject to extensive post-translation modification. agnoprotein dephosphorylated by PP2A inhibits JC replication to levels comparable with the alanine substitution mutants. JC small T antigen has been shown to bind to both PP2A and agnoprotein. this raises the intriguing possibility that both phosphorylated and dephosphorylated forms of agnoprotein have defined functions. agnoproteins of JC and SV40 appear to perform similar functions during the virus life cycle. loss of agnoprotein appears to correlate with defects in the late stages of the virus life cycle and to perturb egress. agnoprotein may also play a role in packaging the SV40 genome. three late proteins have been shown to aid in SV40 entry and release by virtue of their viroporin-like properties. VP2 and VP3 are generated from successive Met residues within the VP2 messenger RNA so they share a common carboxyl-terminus. they are classed as minor constituents of the virus particle. SV40 viruses lacking VP4 exhibit a significant defect in virus spread. it is currently uncertain why SV40 might require VP4 when other polyomaviruses do not. JC agnoprotein may also serve as a viroporin. a wide range of immunosuppressant therapies are being applied to combat autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis. links between JC and a range of human cancers have also been reported. JC encodes for early proteins, which constitute the small and large T antigens and their many splice variants. agnoprotein expression manipulates host trafficking pathways to allow transport of agnoprotein to the cell surface to mediate plasma membrane permeabilization. agnoprotein interacts with the sub-unit of adaptor protein complex 3 (AP-3), inhibiting its function and as consequence preventing trafficking of agnoprotein to the lysosome for destruction. agnoproteins containing mutations that would be expected to impair amphipathic helix formation display decreased Large T binding and significantly reduced virus genome replication. agnoproteins containing mutations that would be expected to impair amphipathic helix formation display decreased Large T binding and significantly reduced virus genome replication. JC infected cells show protrusions and invaginations in the NE. the amino terminal domain of agnoprotein is capable of binding to HP-1 inducing disassociation from LBR and resulting in morphological changes to the NE. JC viruses containing alanine substitutions at these sites were less able to maintain an active infection. depletion of PP2A from JC infected cells also resulted in reduced virus replication. this raises the intriguing possibility that both phosphorylated and de-phosphorylated forms of agnoprotein have defined functions. interplay between the two contributes to the successful replication and propagation of JC. DIDS is a broad-spectrum inhibitor of ion channels. it is possible that the target of its actions is an agnoprotein viroporin. it is possible that the target of its actions is an agnoprotein viroporin. SV40 is a non-enveloped virus, but it has evolved strategies to allow transport of the incoming virion through the membranous environment of the cytoplasm to the nucleus. both VP2 and VP3 form pores in cellular membranes and may aid in delivery of the SV40 virion into the nucleus. VP4 is thought not to be incorporated into SV40 capsids. papillomaviruses are small, non-enveloped DNA viruses around 55 nm in diameter. most PV encode six early (E1, E2, E4, E5, E6 and E7) and two late structural genes (L1 and L2). HPV16 E5 is a highly hydrophobic, 83 amino acid membrane protein. it resides in the lumen of cytoplasmic membranes and interacts with a growing number of cellular partners. lack of specific antibodies preclude localization studies from virus infected cells. in 2012 our laboratory demonstrated that the E5 oligomer could mediate the controlled release of the small molecule carboxyflourescein using a liposome dye release assay. the stoichiometry of HPV16 E5 was predicted to be hexameric using in silico modelling and confirmed by native PAGE electrophoresis. the sequence of HPV16 E5 was obtained from Uniprot. each monomer in the model was minimized individually to restore the symmetry. oligomeric state of HPV16 E5 was confirmed by native PAGE and transmission electron microscopy. the precise mechanism by which E5 manipulates the EGFR is unclear. the current consensus model is that E5 expression is associated with a deacidification of endosomes. this prevents normal degradative trafficking pathways, which would culminate in deposition of active EGFR in the lysosome. the presence of a defined pore size of 2 nm was confirmed in these studies. future work should focus on determining the ion selectivity of the E5 channel to concludesively determine whether there is a preference for protons or whether ion selectivity fluctuates dependent on the particular membrane environment. the triple membrane spanning topology of HPV16 E5 was determined by partial membrane permeabilization fluorescence studies in cells. these support the idea that the E5 amino terminus resides in the lumen of the ER with a carboxyl terminus exposed to the cytosol. lack of specific antibodies preclude localization studies from virus infected cells. a recognizable E5 gene is missing from several HPV types (beta, gamma and mu) HPV16 E5 is predicted to have three transmembrane domains (TMDs; boxes) based on hydrophobic nature of its amino acids. the second TMD facilitates the recently identified interaction with the transmembrane protein YIPF4 as well as the 16K subunit of the H+-ATPase. the model for an E5 monomer contained three TMD and had the lowest energy. each monomer was minimized individually to restore the symmetry. the oligomeric state of HPV16 E5 was confirmed by native PAGE and transmission electron microscopy. active EGFR appears to be re-routed into recycling endosomes. this prevents normal degradative trafficking pathways, which would culminate in deposition of active EGFR in the lysosome and termination of EGFR signalling. if this proves to be the case then E5 would represent the first example of an oncogenic viroporin. viroporins are multi-faceted viral proteins shown to play key roles in the life cycles of a number of important human pathogens. identifying viroporin deletion mutants in these viruses will undoubtedly help to delineate their functions. increasing understanding of viroporin structure and function will hopefully lead to the development of these much needed treatments."}
