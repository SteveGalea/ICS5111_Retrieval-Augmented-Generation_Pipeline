SLTRiP is a Conserved Tryptophan-rich Protein with Potential B- and T-cell Epitopes Plasmodium LS-exported proteins could be excellent vaccine candidates due to their potential processing by hepatocytes.

SLTRiP eluted over an extended time in three peaks having overlapping boundaries. the native PAGE analysis of purified SLTRiP supported the GFC conclusion as to its multimeric nature. the multimeric nature of SLTRiP might be advantageous with respect to its antigenic properties due to its slow release in immunized mice. mouse anti-SLTRiP antibodies specifically recognized SLTRiP in sporozoite lysate. the absence of SLTRiP antibody cross-reactivity with blood stage parasites highlights that SLTRiP is different from other tryptophan-rich proteins expressed during the blood stages. the parasite load in the livers of SLTRiP immunized mice is 4 log scale (10,000 times) lower as compared with the control group of mice. each bar represents the average 18S-rRNA copy number from five mice. the only promising vaccine against malaria in its pre-erythrocytic stage is RTS,S, but it gives only partial protection of 30\u201350%. in the future, the efficacy of the RTS,S vaccine may be increased by combining it with new antigens that have high vaccine potential. the delay in pre-patent period in SLTRiP immunized versus control group mice. sporozoites Protection showed only a 1-day delay in pre-patent period. the above loss of protection implies that T cells are responsible for a majority of the protection observed in wild type mice. RAG-1null mice lack both B- and T-cells. 10-fold protection was observed in matched wild type controls. SLTRiP protein is expressed in sporozoites, liver stages, and blood stages. 80% of infected host cells showed export of SLTRiP at 12 h post-sporozoite infection. infected cells were stained with mouse anti-SLTRiP polyclonal sera. in control experiments cells were stained with anti-parasite HSP70 antibody. the SLTRiP gene locus was targeted with a ScaI linearized replacement plasmid containing the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTR regions of the SLTRiP locus. after a double crossover event, the SLTRiP gene was replaced by the GFP/human dihydrofolate reductase cassette, resulting in the SLTRiP-KO parasite [P. berghei SLTRiP::hDHFR&GFP a 12-h-old cell was stained with anti-SLTRiP antibody. fluorescent images were captured on an Axio-Imager M2 (Zeiss) fitted with ApoTome. the figure shows the export of SLTRiP into the cytosol of the infected host cell. the average number of sporozoites in mosquito salivary glands was 14,000 2000 compared with 16,000 2000 in WT parasites. this finding also indicates that earlier mosquito stages were not affected in SLTRiP-KO. each bar represents the average of two independent invasion experiments. error bars represent the S.E. of each group. smallest group has 8% parasites in the case of wild type.

LS are clinically silent and constitute ideal targets for causal prophylactic drugs and vaccines. anti-SLTRiP polyclonal antibodies showed minimal protection against sporozoite challenge. parasites might be using SLTRiP's highly antigenic exposed epitopes as a smoke screen to hide critical protective epitopes from the immune system. innate immune responses are likely to play a small role in protection. SLTRiP-KO parasites had a normal phenotype during the blood stages. previous studies have shown that proteins like UIS3, UIS4, SLARP, L-FABP regulate liver stage development of parasites without affecting the blood or mosquito stage. SLTRiP is also a parasite protein that perform stage-specific functions during the liver stage of malaria parasites. deletion of the SLTRiP gene from the parasite caused a 1-day delay in liver stage growth. it led to the modulation of roughly 2800 host genes. it is possible that deletion of SLTRiP may activate a back-up mechanism in the parasite. SLTRiP polyclonal antibodies showed minimal protection against sporozoite challenge. sporozoites migrate through several hepatocytes before invading one with the formation of a parsitophorous vacuole (41) parasites lacking SLTRiP had an unchanged phenotype during the mosquito stage, indicating SLTRiP-KO parasites had normal development. SLTRiP-deficient parasites had a normal phenotype during the blood stages. previous studies have shown that proteins like UIS3, UIS4, SLARP, L-FABP, and others regulate liver stage development of parasites without affecting the blood or mosquito stage (45\u201347). these proteins perform liver stage-specific functions and are only essential during the liver stage. the presence of 19 tryptophan residues in SLTRiP makes it a unique protein associated with protein-protein interaction and signaling events. a single protein (e.g. CSP, NS1 and ROP16) in diverse pathogens can regulate various pathways in the host cell (7, 26, 51) SLTRiP exposed epitopes are a smoke screen to hide critical protective epitopes from the immune system. innate immune responses are likely to play a small role in protection. sporozoites migrate through several hepatocytes before invading one. previously, three liver-stage proteins have been shown to be exported to hepatocyte cytoplasm CSP (7, 48), IBIS1 (49), and LISP2 (50). SLTRiP interferes with multiple pathways in the host cell, e.g. RNA processing and transport, structural components of the ribosome, immunity, focal adhesion, and the cytoskeleton. the presence of 19 tryptophan residues in SLTRiP makes it a unique protein associated with protein-protein interaction and signaling events. a single protein (e.g. CSP, NS1 and ROP16) in diverse pathogens can regulate various pathways in the host cell (7, 26, 51) a single protein (e.g. CSP, NS1 and ROP16) in diverse pathogens can regulate various pathways in the host cell. sporozoites migrate through several hepatocytes before invading one with the formation of a parsitophorous vacuole (41). sporozoites migrate through several hepatocytes before invading one with the formation of a parsitophorous vacuole (41). other parasite proteins play roles in movement, receptor interaction, and induction of the protective immune response (42\u201344). SLTRiP is a parasite protein that performs stage-specific functions during the liver stage of malaria parasites. it is likely exported to the hepatocyte cytoplasm through the PEXEL-mediated export mechanism. previously, three liver-stage proteins have been shown to be exported to hepatocyte cytoplasm CSP. the presence of 19 tryptophan residues in SLTRiP makes it a unique protein associated with protein-protein interaction and signaling events. a single protein (e.g. CSP, NS1 and ROP16) in diverse pathogens can regulate various pathways in the host cell (7, 26, 51)"}
