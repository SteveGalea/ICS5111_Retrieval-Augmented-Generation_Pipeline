{"summary": "natural disasters are classified as geophysical, metrological, hydrological, climatological and biological. the 20th century witnessed an increase in disaster losses. climate change will increase the rate of increase of disasters. the management of all of these diseases includes a behavior change component. it becomes important to gain a better understanding of the utility of behavior change theories to contribute across a range of risk management domains. the utility of a theory is thus a function of its ability to predict behavioral outcomes. people within a given area differ with regard to the nature and level of their preparedness and how people make choices about how to manage that risk. if variables can be consistently implicated as components of behavioral change interventions, in different parts of the world, this knowledge can be used to inform education programs. a systematic literature review was prepared to assess the application of behavioral theories to disaster and emergency health preparedness. the systematic literature review protocol was prepared to guide the development of the study objectives, questions, inclusion and exclusion criteria. however, the protocol was not registered. iv) are studies applying behavioral theories to disaster and emergency health preparedness more common in areas where the rates of disaster events are widespread. iv) are studies applying behavioral theories to disaster and emergency health preparedness more common in areas where the rates of disaster events are widespread\" [English language] marked 1,672 November 12, 2014; 10:15 AM Mosby\u2019s Index(Nursing Index) and TITLE-ABS-KEY (prepar* OR read* OR \u201cprotective action\u201d OR plann*) study selection, data extraction and analysis First, articles were assessed based on their titles and then on the basis of abstracts in order to exclude articles not fulfilling the inclusion criteria. the remaining articles\u2019 full texts were archived and read, and at this stage, articles that did not meet the inclusion criteria were rejected. a total of 2040 titles, 450 abstracts and 62 full texts of articles were assessed for eligibility criteria. a total of 2040 titles, 450 abstracts and 62 full texts of articles were assessed. five articles were archived from google Scholar and other sources. the same study was published in two different journals 23, 24. it used the EPPM to assess preventive measures against avian influenza 26. protectionive motivation theory was used to investigate non-pharmaceutical measures against unspecified influenza 26. social cognitive model was applied to assess preparedness for swine flu 27. one study that applied the HBM to investigate factors influencing the vaccination status of pregnant women didn\u2019t clearly report the components of HBM positively or negatively determining the vaccination status. the response rates of three studies were quite high, from 88.8% to 94.8% 14, 15, 16, while one study sent a questionnaire two times. average response rate was 58% 18, and in one study the response rate was not reported 17. the interpretation of the results of each of these studies needs to take into account sample size, setting and response rate. these factors introduce potential sources of bias into the nature and interpretation of the respective studies\u2019 findings. perceived threat and perceived efficacy predicted the willingness of health workers to respond to an emergency when either required or asked 19, 20, 21. perceived psychological preparedness reported to be a vital predictor of willingness to respond to emergency 19, 20, 21. the TPB was applied to assess the intention of getting swine flu vaccine in the face of the epidemic 16, 17, and to investigate nurses\u2019 intention and volunteering to care for SARS patients. attitude (b=0.25, p0.001) and subjective norm (b=0.40, p0.001) were positively associated with behavioral intention for swine flu vaccination. self-efficacy was not associated with behavioral intention (b=-0.7, p>0.05) attitude (b= -0.51, p 0.001) and subjective norm (b= - 0.20, p > 0.05) inversely predicted behavioral intention for swine flu vaccination. self-efficacy (b= - 0.08, p > 0.05) did not predict behavioral intention 17. PMT includes threat appraisal and coping appraisal as its major elements. threat appraisal was measured by perceived personal risk, emotional response to threat and perceived severity of health threat. coping appraisal was found to explain self-reported intention of pharmaceutical measures 26. the range of theories used to assess flood hazard preparedness provided an opportunity to examine the diversity of variables. the PADM \u201chas a more detailed set of salient beliefs\u201d and its clarity in terms of \u201cresponse costs\u201d compared with PMT 29. trust influenced and reduced dread level induced by flood (b= -0.29, p 0.001), which was associated with low level of preparedness intentions. risk appraisal, coping appraisal, and some components of institutional context variables correlated with risk reducing behavior 31. preparedness for earthquake Four studies addressing earthquake preparedness were identified. these studies applied the social cognitive model 35, 36, the VIT 37 and Person-relative-to-event model 38. 76%) applied the VIT to examine preparedness for earthquake and tornado hazards. however, this study did not generate any evidence that could support an association between VIT variables and preparedness 37. study (n=64) that used social-ecological resilience theory. found vulnerability (educational attainment) and adaptive capacity were associated with adoption of household emergency plans. but exposure was not significantly associated with emergency planing. precaution adoption theory identifies absolute risk perception, relative risk perception, fear, preoccupation and perceived control as predictors, and protective action as the dependent variable 42. results from the PAT study showed preoccupation with tornadoes, recollections of fear and negative affect when thinking about tornadoes were associated with protective action. the need for theories to demonstrate all-hazards capability was discussed. third study (n=800), termed the model it applied for terrorism preparedness, \u201cadaptation terror preparedness\u201d also included risk perceptions, social networks, emotive, and information as the predictors of adaptive behavior for terrorism. the first two studies 43, 44 used data from the same study participants. despite the variation of association between self-efficacy and willingness to respond, self-efficacy was found to be sole predictor of willingness to respond. other components of the EPPM were not statistically associated with willingness to respond 47. evidence which emerged from studies applying the HBM to investigate preparedness for influenza demonstrated that perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, and perceived barriers were able to predict preparedness for disease outbreaks. however, the same model (HBM) and the same method of analysis for preparedness for heat wave hazards showed that risk perception (perceived susceptibility and severity) and perceived barriers were not associated with preparedness 41. the method of analysis used to show the relationship of constructs proved crucial for demonstrating the predictive utility of the theory for hazard preparedness. most studies that applied HBM did demonstrate this 14, 15, 16, 18, 41. the second most commonly used model was the EPPM. a strong association of self-efficacy with intention and preparedness was reported. however, the other study in this context failed to produce clear evidence of an ability to predict preparedness 23. the social cognitive model was another model with a history of application across various hazards (influenza, flood, earthquake, tornado and others) studies addressing the terrorism derived their models from other popular theories. at times, studies had also used a combination of two theories/models. however, no specific man-made hazards, apart from general terrorism, had been specifically focused. the search did identify papers covering the most commonly used theories and models and brought to light those less frequently used in the preparedness literature. the inclusion of specific terms along with general terms found to capture more studies with theories and models even whose specific terms were unspecified in search strategies. despite these limitations, we believe that this systematic review could contribute to the existing literature on disasters and emergencies preparedness. the search strategy identified only three studies from Asia. this identifies a need for more systematic all-hazards testing. this identifies a need for additional research to target the use of behavioral change theories in the Asian countries that bear the brunt of disasters and their consequences. studies ideally purported to reveal this interdependence of variables/elements/constructs, besides demonstrating the direct influence of some specific constructs on each other. some studies did not give the information pertaining to the influence of each construct on each other and the analyses used were traditional logistic regressions. information sources 7 Describe all information sources (e.g., databases with dates of
