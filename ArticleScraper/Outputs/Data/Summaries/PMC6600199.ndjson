{"summary": "the etiological agent of IB is infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a gammacoronavirus belonging to the Nidovirales order, Coronaviridae family, species Avian coronavirus. each 10% reduction in IBV would be worth around \u00a3654 million to the global poultry industry. untranslated regions (UTR) are located at the 5 and 3 ends of the genome. nsp14 exhibits 3-to-5 exoribonuclease activity (5) which forms part of a proofreading system that facilitates a high-fidelity replication of both genomic and subgenomic RNAs. the process of attenuation by egg passage is not guaranteed, as it is possible for viruses to remain virulent at the end of serial passaging. it is also unclear whether attenuation is linked to the adaptation of the virus to growth in the egg or another unknown mechanism. RESULTS Generation of serially egg-passaged viruses. a pathogenic strain of IBV belonging to the Massachusetts serotype lineage GI-1 (23), M41-CK, was used to inoculate four embryonated eggs to establish four separate virus lineages (A, B, C, and D) after 13 subsequent passages, virus could no longer be detected in lineage B by routine reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) screening. serially egg-passaged viruses exhibit an in vitro phenotype similar to that of the virulent parent M41-CK. confluent 6-well plates of CK cells were infected with virus at an MOI of 0.05. each value represents the mean of three replicates, with SEMs plotted as error bars. serially egg-passaged M41-CK viruses are attenuated in vivo. groups of 12 8-day-old specific-pathogen-free chickens were inoculated with 1 105 PFU of IBV or mock infected with 0.1 ml of serum-free medium. each virus characterization had their own mock infection and virulent M41-CK virus controls. average ciliary activity scores over 50% suggest that IBV is attenuated. on days 4 and 6 postinfection, the average ciliary activity of chickens infected with all serially egg-passaged M41-CK viruses remained above a 50% threshold. chickens inoculated with lineage C showed clinical signs consistent with IBV infection. all three birds infected with lineage A tested positive for IBV RNA on day 4 postinfection. none of the birds tested positive for IBV RNA in the trachea on day 6 postinfection. the average ciliary activities for birds infected with lineage A did not differ. sites with no coverage (=13) have been plotted as having coverage of 1. dotted line shows site where consensus has not been called. each circle represents a nucleotide substitution. consensus mutations occurring within a 499-nucleotide window. consensus could be called for 89.53%, 89.16%, 99.90%, and 99.90% of the viral genome for lineages A to D. mutations accumulated at the 3 end of the genome, within the N gene and 3 UTR. consensus-level mutations could not be called for 2,858, 2,959, 18, and 18 positions, respectively, due to the minimum coverage threshold. consensus-level mutations occurring within a 499-nucleotide window, 249 bp on either side of the midpoint position. a total of 9 SNPs were identified in more than one sample. in total, 156 unique polymorphisms were identified across each of the five lineages. each exhibiting a diversity profile of variants unique to that lineage. this variant mapping suggests the emergence of new highly diverse regions in the attenuated virus rather than further diversification of preexisting regions present in the original population. all five consensus sequences were aligned to virulent M41 or to ma5, H52, and H120 vaccine strain sequences available in the NCBI database. only seven consensus-level changes resulting in a match to a vaccine strain sequence (i.e., Ma5, H52, or H120) were identified out of 153 SNPs within the egg-passaged viruses. no common trend in variant frequency is observed for mutations identified in virulent M41-CK. nine variants were detected within the original M41-CK population. three of them were no longer detectable in any egg-attenuated virus. Variants were called in each of the five viruses against the M41-CK consensus sequence. NS mutations are shown in solids, while S mutations are shown in a checkered pattern. mutants occurring within the 5 and 3 UTR have been plotted as S mutations. pathogenic strain of IBV belonging to the Massachusetts serotype lineage GI-1 (23), M41-CK, was used to inoculate four embryonated eggs to establish four separate virus lineages. after 13 subsequent passages, virus could no longer be detected in lineage B by routine reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) screening. pathogenicity was assessed for resultant EP106 viruses using in vivo and in vitro methods, with a further stock, EP107, grown solely for the serially egg-passaged viruses exhibit an in vitro phenotype similar to that of the virulent parent M41-CK. each serially passaged viral isolate caused a significant reduction in ciliary activity compared to that in the mock-infected group. each serially passaged viral isolate caused a significant reduction in ciliary activity compared to that in the mock-infected group. serially egg-passaged M41-CK viruses are attenuated in vivo. groups of 12 8-day-old specific-pathogen-free chickens were inoculated with 1 105 PFU of IBV or mock infected with 0.1 ml of serum-free medium. each virus characterization had their own mock infection and virulent M41-CK virus controls. average ciliary activity scores over 50% suggest that IBV is attenuated. on days 4 and 6 postinfection, the average ciliary activity of chickens infected with all serially egg-passaged M41-CK viruses remained above a 50% threshold. chickens inoculated with lineage C showed clinical signs consistent with IBV infection. all three birds infected with lineage A tested positive for IBV RNA on day 4 and day 6 postinfection. the average ciliary activities for birds infected with lineage A did not differ between day 4 and day 6 postinfection. the average ciliary activities for birds infected with lineage A did not differ between day 4 and day 6 postinfection. sites with no coverage (=13) have been plotted as having coverage of 1. dotted line shows site where consensus has not been called. each circle represents a nucleotide substitution. consensus mutations occurring within a 499-nucleotide window. consensus could be called for 89.53%, 89.16%, 99.90%, and 99.90% of the viral genome for lineages A to D. mutations accumulated at the 3 end of the genome, within the N gene and 3 UTR. consensus-level mutations could not be called for 2,858, 2,959, 18, and 18 positions, respectively, due to the minimum coverage threshold. consensus-level mutations occurring within a 499-nucleotide window, 249 bp on either side of the midpoint position. synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations for each virus, for each genomic location. in total, 156 unique polymorphisms were identified across each of the five lineages. each exhibiting a diversity profile of variants unique to that lineage. this variant mapping suggests the emergence of new highly diverse regions in the attenuated virus rather than further diversification of preexisting regions present in the original population. all five consensus sequences were aligned to virulent M41 or to vaccine strain sequences available in the NCBI database. only seven consensus-level changes resulting in a match to a vaccine strain sequence (i.e., Ma5, H52, or H120) were identified out of 153 SNPs within the egg-passaged viruses. nine variants were detected within the original M41-CK population. three of them were no longer detectable in any egg-attenuated virus. if a variant initially exists, it does not necessarily reach fixation. Variants were called in each of the five viruses against the M41-CK consensus sequence. NS mutations are shown in solids, while S mutations are shown in a checkered pattern. mutants occurring within the 5 and 3 UTR have been plotted as S mutations. DISCUSSION Serial egg passaging of virulent IBVs to attenuate the virus has long been used as the standard procedure for generating a vaccine. our efforts identified few SNPs shared among all four of the attenuated final-passage viruses at both the consensus and subconsensus level. compared to the starting population, each attenuated virus shows an apparent increase in sequence diversity at both the consensus and subconsensus levels after serial egg passaging. current strategies for characterizing the pathogenicity of IBV isolates largely rely on in vivo studies as limited overlap is observed between in vitro and in vivo characteristics. attenuation of IBV by serial egg passage results in different patterns of genomic variation each time. a reverse genetics system would allow for the development of rationally attenuated IBVs with high efficacy and safety. all animal experimental protocols were performed in the home office facility. the experiments were performed using specific-pathogen-free chickens and embryonated eggs. allantoic fluid was diluted with BES medium between 1:100 and 1:10,000. lineage B could no longer be detected after routine screening at passage 14. tracheal organ cultures were prepared from 19-day-old SPF RIR embryos. groups of 11 TOCs were infected with 5 104 PFU of IBV. cultures were incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C in a rotating incubator. the level of ciliary activity of each TOC was determined on days 4 to 8 postinoculation. the assessor was blinded to the experimental group. the level of ciliostasis of each trachea was determined by light microscopy. the assessor was blinded to the experimental group. cDNA was synthesized from RNA isolated from tracheas extracted during the experiments to assess the pathogenicity of lineage A. a positive control known to contain IBV RNA and a no-template negative control were used at the reverse transcription and PCR stages. stocks of each of the five viruses were grown in order to obtain sufficient purified RNA. stocks of both the starting (M41-CK) and final (lineages A to D, passage 106) viral populations were grown for sequencing. quality-filtered reads for all five viruses were aligned to the M41-CK consensus sequence with bowtie2 (reads inputted as unpaired reads) a consensus sequence was generated from this alignment where indel mutations were permitted and a minimum coverage threshold of 10 reads was required. a pathogenic strain of IBV belonging to the Massachusetts serotype lineage GI-1, M41-CK (23) in 100 l of serum-free N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid (BES medium) was inoculated into the allantoic cavities of four 10-day-old embryonated SPF RIR chicken eggs (A, B, C, and D) ucleotides BG56 (5\u2032-CAACAGCGCCCAAAGAAG-3) and 93/100 (5-GCTCTAACTCTATACTAGCCT-3) were used to infect two eggs, A and A1, which remained independent for the duration of the experiment. the disappearance of lineage B could have been caused by multiple factors. cultures were incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C in a rotating incubator. the level of ciliary activity of each TOC was determined on days 4 to 8 postinoculation. the assessor was blinded to the experimental group. the level of ciliostasis of each trachea was determined by light microscopy. the assessor was blinded to the experimental group. cDNA was synthesized from RNA isolated from tracheas extracted. a positive control known to contain IBV RNA and a no-template negative control were used at the reverse transcription and PCR stages. stocks of each of the five viruses were grown in order to obtain sufficient purified RNA. stocks of both the starting (M41-CK) and final (lineages A to D, passage 106) viral populations were infected with 100 l of IBV-infected allantoic fluid. quality-filtered reads for all five viruses were aligned to the M41-CK consensus sequence with bowtie2 (reads inputted as unpaired reads) a minimum coverage threshold of 10 reads was required for a nucleotide to be called. sequence was deposited in GenBank under accession number MK728875."}
