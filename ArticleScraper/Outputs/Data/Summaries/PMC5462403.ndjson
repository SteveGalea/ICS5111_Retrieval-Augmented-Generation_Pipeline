{"summary": "the introduction of molecular diagnostic methods has significantly improved the epidemiological investigation of viral pneumonia in the ICU in recent years with increased potential for detection of a wide array of viruses. viruses accounted for 20\u201350% of total infections in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with severe respiratory distress [1\u20134]. the aims of this retrospective study were: i) to describe the frequency of respiratory viruses in patients admitted to the ICU during a winter-spring season. ii) to monitor the presence of polymorphisms at position 222 in the HA gene of influenza A/H1N1pdm09 strains. diagnostic and clinical management of patients admitted to hospitals in the Lombardy Region with severe and moderate influenza like illness (ILI) included prospective influenza A detection, subtyping and sequencing. the latter two were centralized at two Regional Reference Laboratories. HA Sanger sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were performed on quantified BAL and Brasp specimens. the complete influenza A/H1N1pdm09 HA gene was amplified directly from clinical specimens using the SuperScriptIII One-Step RT-PCR amplification kit. a bootstrap analysis with 1,000 replicates was performed. DNA, 5 l of 10x buffer, 0.25 l of each primer (10 uM) HA222-for 5\u2019-ATAGCACCYTTGGGTGTCTG-3\u2019, 1 l of PCR grade nucleotide mix (200M each dNTP), 0.5 l of FastStart High-Fidelity enzyme blend (5U/l) and 28.5 l PCR grade water were purified with agencourt AMPure XP magnetic beads. analysis of NGS data Sequencing data obtained as standard flowgram format (SFF) files from the GS run processor. reads were trimmed using the multiplex identifiers (MIDs) for each sample. the identification of variants was made using the default AVA settings. lyses were centralized at the Molecular Virology Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia or at the department of biomedical sciences for health, University of Milan. all samples positive for influenza A/H1N1pdm09 virus were analyzed for the presence of polymorphisms. a panel of laboratory-developed real-time RT-PCR or real-time PCR [14,15] were used. purified PCR products were sequenced using the BigDye Terminator Cycle-Sequencing kit. sequences were assembled using the Sequencher software, version 4.6. amplicon Primers targeting the influenza A HA gene spanning codons 180\u2013286 were used to amplify the region containing codon 222. the reaction was carried out using the FastStart High-Fidelity PCR kit (Roche Applied Science) dilution of 1109 molecules/l was performed for each amplicon. mixture was then pooled in an equimolar concentration. purified pool was clonally amplified by emulsion PCR. p-values of 0.05 were considered statistically significant. patients and samples A total of 150 respiratory samples from 88 patients admitted to ICUs with severe respiratory syndrome were analyzed. 2/23 (8.7%) had coinfections with influenza A/H1N1pdm09 and Candida spp, 1/23 (4.3%) with A/H1N1pdm09 and Aspergillus spp, 1/23 (4.3%) with influenza A and K. pneumoniae. 19/23 (82.7%) were negative (data not shown). total of 51 (36 NS and 13 BAL or Brasp) respiratory samples from 41 H1N1pdm09-positive ICU patients were analyzed by both Sanger and NGS sequencing. no sequencing data were obtained in respiratory samples of 15/41 (31.7%) ICU patients due to low viral load. 22/26 strains carried the wild-type 222D codon. four (15.7%) strains carried mixtures at position 222. 222D/N/G, one the 222D/N/A mixture and the other 222D/N. 7969 D (61.06), N (21.23), G (17.71) D/N/G 21 7 A/Pavia/160/2015 NS negative NA - D - BAL 5.3x105 7092 D (100) D 8 8 A/Pavia/271/2015 NS 1.0x109 6818 D (100) D 4 Brasp 2.7x109 6847 D (100) D 16 9 A/Pavia/247/2015 NS 4.5x median of 5506 (range 1966\u201313083) sequence reads were obtained per sample. amplicons length was 341 nt, which allowed detection and quantification of minority mutations with a cut-off value of 0.50%. number of variants in the LRT samples was significantly higher than that observed in URT samples of ICU patients. GS analysis identified only a 222D polymorphism showed an overall lower number of variants compared to samples with mixed variants at position 222. a longitudinal NGS analysis of the viral population was possible in a limited number of patients (n = 4) in 66/69 (95.6%) of the positive episodes, a single virus was observed. in 41/57 (71.9%) patients, subtype A/H1N1pdm09 (40 single and 1 co-infection) was detected. in 16/57 (28.1%) patients a subtype A/H3N2 (15 single and 1 co-infection) was detected. the median viral load in LRT samples was slightly higher than that observed in the URT of ICU patients. the median viral load in LRT samples of control patients was slightly higher than that observed in the URT of ICU patients. all of the influenza A/H1N1pdm09 strains belonged to subgroup 6B. subgroup 6B was characterized by constitutional K163Q, A256T, K283E and E374K polymorphisms. additional amino acid polymorphisms were sporadically observed in HA sequences. # Strain Sample FluA load (copies/ml) No. reads 222 polymorphisms No. variants NGS (%) Sanger 1 A/Pavia/11/2015 NS negative NA - - BAL 3.8x107 7566 D (34.59), N (38.53), G (26.88) D/N/G 30 2 A/Pavia/15/2015 NS 5.9x104 3264 D (100) D 7 BAL 1.9x105 4725 NGS analysis was successfully performed in 31/41 (75.6%) ICU and 21/21 (100.0%) control patients. the number of variants in the LRT samples was significantly higher than that observed in URT samples (median 14, range 2\u201330) number of variants was performed in paired URT and LRT samples for 4/10 (40.0%) patients. in 6/10 (60.0%) patients it could only be performed in LRT samples. mutations (G/N/A) at codon 222 were observed in 4/13 (30.8%) LRT samples. in samples from patients #1 and #2, viral load and number of variants decreased simultaneously and only the wild-type amino acid (222D) was detected 13 and 8 days after admission. the decrease in viral load and number of variants was associated with the re-emergence of 222A at a low frequency. a predominance of influenza A/H3N2 strains in Europe and Italy was observed during the same period. the difference between viral loads was more evident in paired samples where in all cases except one, viral load was higher in the LRT than in the same patient group. a greater number of H1N1pdm09 virus variants were observed in the LRT. the 222G/N mutations known to be associated with increased clinical severity were observed in 30% of LTR samples of ICU patients. over 70% of ICU patients showed no specific HA mutations in the lung. the quasispecies analysis focused only on codon 222. in a portion of the ICU patients, only upper respiratory samples were available. the diagnosis was performed on a partially biased group of samples."}
