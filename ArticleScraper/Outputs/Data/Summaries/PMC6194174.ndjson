{"summary": "the genus Cardiovirus includes encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) and Saffold viruses (SAFV) EMCV has been found to infect over 30 host species and contains one serotype, Mengo virus, which was isolated in 1948. 2B in TMEV and SAFV is unlikely to act as a protein as it is predicted to encode a peptide of 14 amino acids. TMEV and Saffold virus (SAFV) form the Theilovirus species. dsRNA is recognized by several sensor proteins within the cell. it triggers a signal transduction pathway that results in transcription of the type I IFN (IFN-/) genes, as well as IFN-. dsRNA is detected by toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3). the importance of MDA5 for control of cardioviruses was demonstrated in MDA5-deficient mice, which failed to control EMCV infection and did not efficiently produce IFN. MOV10 expression in HEK293 cells restricted EMCV replication. LGP2 was initially thought to negatively regulate dsRNA recognition by RIG-I. but later studies have established that LGP2 acts as a co-activator of MDA5. mice deficient for LGP2 were impaired in responding to RNA ligands. dsRNA can bind and activate recombinant MDA5 in the absence of other proteins. it is likely that additional partners are required for efficient activation of MDA5 in vivo. dsRNA can bind and activate recombinant MDA5 in the absence of other proteins. single-stranded TMEV genome enhanced the association of LGP2 and PACT. PACT was shown to be required for induction of IFN by EMCV but not Sendai virus. DHX29 mediated RNA binding of MDA5 by interacting with MDA5 through its N-terminus and RNA through its DEXD and helicase domains. DHX29 promotes formation of MDA5 filaments, which are required for activation. these proteins include LGP2, DHX29, PACT and TRBP. dsRNA molecule oligomerizes on the dsRNA molecule. PKR controls virus infection by phosphorylating eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2). PKR-deficiency did not modify survival time of EMCV infected mice. in PKR-deficient cells, EMCV infection failed to induce IRF-3 translocation to the nucleus. a constitutively active mutant of PKR induced IFN through MAVS. PKR was shown to be important for normal processing of IFN- mRNA. dsRNA is not essential for IFN production in cardiovirus-infected cells. mengo virus possessing a deletion in the zinc-finger of L. dsRNA can then be endocytosed by neighboring cells and infiltrating immune cells. mice lacking TLR3 produced less IFN- early in infection (15 and 18 h post-infection) this deficiency was transient and mice lacking MDA5 produced less IFN- at 24 h post-infection. however, this deficiency was transient and mice lacking MDA5 produced less IFN- at 24 h post-infection. the mechanism by which dsRNA could be internalized and then access the cytoplasmic RLRs has been unresolved until a recent discovery identified SIDT2 as a transporter of dsRNA from the endosome to the cytoplasm. a crucial pathway for innate signaling in EMCV infection is release of viral RNA into the extracellular milieu, endocytosis, and subsequent transfer of viral RNA to the cytoplasm. EMCV 3C protease cleaves host proteins, such as TANK and MOV10, to prevent the cell from producing IFN. the 3C protease is responsible for cleavage of the Cardiovirus polyprotein produced from translation of the genome. the cardiovirus 3C protease is responsible for cleavage of the Cardiovirus polyprotein produced from translation of the genome. mutations in the zinc finger domain or the Theilo domain of TMEV or SAFV L inhibit its ability to antagonize interferon signaling. a critical step in production of IFN following detection of viral replication by MDA5 and other molecules is nuclear translocation of IRF-3 and NF-B. many viruses within this family disrupt nucleocytoplasmic trafficking. in mammals, the NPC consists of approximately 30 different proteins, called nucleoporins (Nups) and enables transit across the nuclear membrane. transport into the nucleus requires a short amino acid motif, called a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) that can interact with either the or subtypes of karyopherins. localization depends on expression of 2A, which contains a NLS in its C-terminus. 2A is displaced as binding sites for 2A and Ran overlap. inhibition of ERK and p38 was able to block L-mediated hyper-phosphorylation of Nups. erization of IRF-3 occurs despite reports that it accumulates in the nucleus of infected cells. dsRNA is detected in cardiovirus infected cells leading to activation of MAVS and downstream kinases. stress granules can form in cells during virus infection and often result from inhibition of translation following phosphorylation by PKR. the genus Aphthovirus has proteolytic activity whereas the L protein of cardioviruses does not. FMDV Lpro can cleave eIF4G and therefore reduce translation of cellular mRNAs. however, this activity is not present in cardioviruses. astrocytes appear to be the primary producers of IFN- for several neurotropic viruses that preferentially infect neurons. 73% of IFN- production during a neurotropic TMEV infection was from astrocytes, while only 1% was from neurons. mice deficient for MAVS, MyD88 and Trif did not show a significant decrease in IFN- induction. both RLR and TLR signaling are important for IFN- production after TMEV infection of the CNS. astrocytes are stimulated to produce IFN by an abortive infection. this is likely to prevent expression of viral interferon antagonists. levels of IFN-I were strongly decreased in the serum of mice infected by EMCV. the effect of myD88 depletion had a modest effect and loss of Trif or RIG-I did not affect survival. therefore, MDA5 is essential for controlling EMCV infection in the periphery. RNA fragments generated by RNase L can amplify IFN production in a RIG-I, MDA5 and MAVS-dependent way. RNase L targets both viral and cellular mRNA but is also predicted to cleave the genome of ssRNA viruses. in wild-type macrophages, replication of L-mutant was significantly impaired. in contrast, replication of L-mutant and wild-type viruses replicated to the same level in RNase L-deficient primary peritoneal macrophages. a mouse TMEV strain inhibits rat but not mouse RNase L. macrophages were reported to play important roles in EMCV pathogenesis. it is possible that another EMCV protein will have developed some RNase L antagonistic activity. the most important producers of IFN would be uninfected or abortively infected cells. studies involving cardioviruses have revealed a complicated picture regarding initial detection of replicating RNA and induction of IFN. it remains to be determined how these molecules coordinate and interact and whether they function in a cell-type specific manner. future studies in this area will likely have broad relevance for innate detection of viruses."}{"summary": "the genus Cardiovirus includes encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) and Saffold viruses (SAFV) EMCV has been found to infect over 30 host species and contains one serotype, Mengo virus, which was isolated in 1948. 2B in TMEV and SAFV is unlikely to act as a protein as it is predicted to encode a peptide of 14 amino acids.
