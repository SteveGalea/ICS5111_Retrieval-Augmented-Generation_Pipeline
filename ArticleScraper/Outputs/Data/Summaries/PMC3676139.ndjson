{"summary": "Coronaviruses are positive-sense RNA viruses and are currently classified into four genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus (1). surveillance of coronaviruses in wild animals has led to the discovery of the greatest diversity of coronaviruses in bat and avian species. phylogenetic studies of bat and avian coronaviruses suggest an ancient relationship with possible codivergence alphacoronaviruses have been detected in different mouse-eared bats. however, they do not migrate long distances, with few traveling farther than hundreds of miles to overwinter sites. the tMRCA of Alphacoronavirus is estimated to be around 4,400 years ago. coronaviruses are orders of magnitude older than suggested by previous molecular clock analyses. representative coronavirus genomes from the four genera were selected for this study. human coronavirus NL63 Homo sapiens NL63/DEN/2009/14 JQ765564 2009 Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus Sus scrofa CH/FJND-3 JQ282909 2011 Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus Sus scrofa CH/S JN547228 1986 Transmissible gastroenteritis virusb Sus scrofa H16 FJ755618 1973 Transmissible gastroenteritis virusb Sus scrofa Purdue DQ811789 mouse hepatitis virus Mus musculus MHV-MI AB551247 1994 Mouse hepatitis virus RA59/R13 Mus musculus RA59/R13 FJ647218 2006 Sammbar deer coronavirus Cervus unicolor US/OH-WD388-TC FJ425188 1994 Gammacoronavirus Duck coronavirus Duckf DK/CH/HN/ZZ2004 JF705860 2004 a Viruses are classified as a single species (Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 1). b Viruses are classified as a single species (Betacoronavirus 1). e Viruses are classified as a single species (Avian coronavirus). the BS-REL model was implemented to account for the effects of variable selection pressure across codon sites and phylogenetic lineages. we used a modified Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) importance resampling scheme (M = 500 samples), described in detail previously (26). we selected partial viral sequences from five relatively conserved genomic regions. Nsp15-16 (1,320 nucleotides [nt]), the matrix protein (640 nt), papain-like protease 2 (PLP2; 620 nt), the RdRp (1,860 nt) and the Y domain (400 nt) were aligned at the amino acid level by MUSCLE (19) as described previously.

(10), which is inferred primarily from short branches near the tips of the phylogeny. the first nonrecombinant section encompassed Nsp15 and 80 nt of Nsp16. the second section fell entirely within Nsp16. a single recombination breakpoint was detected with GARD. it is unlikely that this breakpoint represents a true recombination event. long branches in coronavirus phylogenies were underestimated by BS-REL. a substantial number of long branches in which the number of substitutions per site approached saturation in the BS-REL model. lengths of these saturated branches cannot be reliably estimated. lineages that bear the mark of stronger purifying selection generally experienced a greater increase in branch length under the BS-REL model. the number of branches approaching saturation was correlated with a greater expansion in the total length under BS-REL. the variance in branch length expansion from GTR + 4 to BS-REL, as approximated with LHS, differed among coronavirus loci. the upper and lower 95% confidence limits differed by orders of magnitude, suggesting highly imprecise estimates of branch length expansion in these loci. however, these results clearly suggested that there is substantial underestimation of the evolutionary history of coronaviruses. GTR + 4 consistently underestimated the simulated tree length. this behavior is due to a long internal branch predominantly subject to strong purifying selection. this behavior is due to a long internal branch predominantly subject to strong purifying selection. tMRCA estimates for alpha- and betacoronaviruses are similar to the dates inferred by a similar methodology from a different data set (31). despite the comprehensive nature of these studies, there are intrinsic shortcomings in the standard evolutionary models used to estimate branch lengths and the tMRCA of ancient viral lineages like coronaviruses. coronavirus tMRCA of 55.8 million years ago would still be 3 orders of magnitude greater than the current estimate. the evolutionary history of coronaviruses likely extend further back in time than previous estimates have suggested. coronaviruses have been infecting bats and/or birds since the origin of these clades tens of millions of years ago or possibly since their divergence from each other in the carboniferous period, over 300 million years ago. this extrapolation should be viewed as a biologically plausible hypothesis based on realistic parameters. in the coronavirus phylogenetic trees, we found general agreement in the inferred branch lengths between evolutionary models (GTR + 4 and BS-REL) there was no evidence of underestimation of the lengths of short branches. previous dating estimates are consistent with our findings. coronaviruses have an evolutionary history much longer than those suggested by phylogenetic trees. this finding allows for a coevolutionary relationship between coronaviruses and their natural hosts. this finding allows for a coevolutionary relationship between coronaviruses and their natural hosts."}
