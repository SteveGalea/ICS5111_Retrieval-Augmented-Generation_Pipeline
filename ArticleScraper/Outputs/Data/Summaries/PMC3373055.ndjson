{"summary": "Methods Study Sample Patients were recruited from 3 primary care sites in Tucson, Arizona. recruitment was conducted during 2 time periods: from December 1, 2003, through February 21, 2004 and from May 1, 2004 through August 14, 2004. patients had to exhibit a lower respiratory syndrome of 1 month's duration. serologic analysis Anti-coccidioidal antibodies were measured in the laboratory of 1 of the authors (J.N.G.) the double immunodiffusion technique was used to measure tube precipitin\u2013type and complement fixing\u2013type anti-coccidioidal antibodies. patients excluded from enrollment if they had a previously diagnosed, laboratory-confirmed coccidioidal infection, were 18 years of age, or had not had previous exposure >1 week in a disease-endemic area. fewer than 5% of the patients offered enrollment refused to participate in the study. dioidal immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG antibodies were measured by enzyme-linked immunoassay by using a commercial kit. an optical density >0.20 was considered positive. the relative sensitivity of these tests in patients with coccidioidal pneumonia has been previously analyzed. 16 of the 55 persons who provided serum samples at baseline were positive by >1 serologic test (29%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 16%\u201344%). all but 3 had positive results for multiple serologic tests for both serum samples. serum sample not obtained 27 *IDTP, immunodiffusion tube precipitin; EIA, enzyme immunoassay; IgM, immunoglobulin M. length of exposure in the disease-endemic area was significantly shorter for patients with valley fever than for those who were seronegative (p = 0.043). 7 (18) 1.0 Musculoskeletal Myalgia 11 (69) 9 (23) 0.0022 Arthralgia 7 (44) 11 (28) 0.35 Rash 3 (19.7) 0.34 The proportion of patients in whom a chest radiograph was obtained was similar between seropositive and seronegative patients (75% vs. 72%). 36 survey and the Iowa Fatigue Scale readministered to 10 persons at the 6-month follow-up visit. the odds ratio for developing coccidioidomycosis in persons with exposure of 10 years to a disease-endemic area was significantly shorter for patients with valley fever than for those who were seronegative. twenty, 24, and 11 participants had age ranges of 40 years, 40\u201364 years, and >65 years respectively. the percentage of participants in each age group with valley fever was 30%, 29%, and 27%, respectively. radiographic abnormalities associated with coccidioidal infection included pulmonary infiltrates in 88% and hilar adenopathy in 1 participant. no differences were seen between seropositive and seronegative groups in either the proportion treated with antimicrobial drugs. high frequency of valley fever as a cause of CAP is consistent with previous estimates of coccidioidomycosis as a dominant cause of CAP with exposure in disease-endemic areas. a similar estimate of 25% to 30% has been obtained retrospectively at the Southern Arizona Veterans Administration Health Care System in Tucson, Arizona (7). the infectious diseases Society of America practice guidelines for CAP currently recommend obtaining a complete travel history only in patients with refractory pneumonia. a shorter length of exposure in a disease-endemic region and a greater frequency of radiographic abnormalities were seen in persons with valley fever compared with those without valley fever. a high proportion of people with valley fever were prescribed an initial course of antimicrobial drugs. 3 of the 12 patients with valley fever who underwent radiographic examination had normal radiographs. this is consistent with results of a previous study. but we did not have a diagnosis for patients without valley fever."}
