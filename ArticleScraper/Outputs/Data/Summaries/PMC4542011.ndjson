{"summary": "influenza viruses can be categorised into different subtypes based on genetic and antigenic differences in the two surface glycoproteins of the virus, the haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) wild waterfowl and shorebirds are the natural reservoirs of influenza A virus and can be infected with viruses harbouring combinations of 16 different HA subtypes and nine different NA subtypes. influenza viruses are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in humans. seasonal influenza viruses constitute an economic burden of $10.4 billion dollars per year in the united states alone [6]. a one-health approach is the only comprehensive way to reduce the burden of disease. wild birds, domestic birds, pigs, horses, humans and bats maintain their own influenza A viruses (arrow in circle, subtype in bold) transmission of LPAI viruses to marine mammals Influenza viruses from waterbirds can cross the species barrier and infect numerous other species. disease manifestations can range from acute respiratory tract disease to an inapparent infection. swine respiratory epithelial cells were thought to express both 2,3- and 2,6-linked sialic acids. avian influenza viruses attach predominantly to 2,3-linked sialic acids. the H3N8 virus has been circulating amongst dogs since at least the 1960s. both viruses can cause severe respiratory disease in dogs. in terrestrial poultry, LPAI viruses are able to evolve into HPAI viruses. a multi-basic cleavage site in the viral HA of HPAI viruses is cleaved by trypsin-like proteins, expressed in the intestinal and respiratory tracts of birds. however, the presence of the multi-basic cleavage site in the HA of HPAI viruses enables these viruses to be cleaved by the furin family of enzymes. this evolution to a highly pathogenic phenotype has only been observed in H5 and H7 mallard ducks (Aythya fuligula) and pochards (Aythya farina) display neurological signs upon infection with HPAI virus A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005(H5N1) no clinical signs were observed in mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), common teals (Anas crecca), Eurasian wigeon (Anas penelope) or gadwalls (A influenza viruses in reptiles were detected against multiple influenza virus strains in captive species of reptiles and amphibians. in vitro and in ovo experiments suggest that alligators are susceptible to infection with avian influenza viruses [58] wild birds, domestic birds, pigs, horses, humans and bats maintain their own influenza A viruses (arrow in circle, subtype in bold) transmission of LPAI viruses to marine mammals Influenza viruses from waterbirds can cross the species barrier. LPAI viruses can also cross species barrier and infect domesticated mammals and birds. disease manifestations can range from acute respiratory tract disease to an inapparent infection. swine infections were considered to be of particular importance because swine respiratory epithelial cells were thought to express both 2,3- and 2,6-linked sialic acids. viruses of the H3N8 and H3N2 subtypes are currently circulating amongst dogs. both viruses can cause severe respiratory disease in dogs. in horses, H3N8 viruses were first detected in the 1960s and have subsequently become endemic. LPAI viruses of the H5 and H7 subtypes can subsequently evolve to become HPAI viruses by the insertion of a multi-basic cleavage site in the viral HA. the presence of the multi-basic cleavage site in the HA of HPAI viruses enables these viruses to be cleaved by the furin family of enzymes. this evolution to a highly pathogenic phenotype has only been observed in H5 and H7 influenza viruses mallard duck is considered the most likely candidate for a long-distance vector of HPAI H5N1 viruses. tufted ducks (Aythya fuligula) and pochards (Aythya farina) display neurological signs upon infection with HPAI virus A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005(H5N1), no clinical signs were observed in mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), common teals (A infected carnivores with HPAI H5N1 virus caused severe respiratory and systemic disease. no severe disease was observed in swine, both after natural or experimental infection. in vitro and in ovo experiments suggest that alligators are susceptible to infection with avian influenza viruses. the 1918 pandemic virus is thought to be avian descent. the 1968 H3N2 virus was derived from a reassortment event between the circulating human H2N2 virus and the HA and PB1 genes from avian influenza virus strain. avian influenza viruses of subtypes H5, H6, H7, H9 and H10 have crossed the species barrier and caused human infections. particular concern are the HPAI H5N1 and LPAI H7N9 virus strains due to the frequency of zoonoses and/or severity of disease they cause. countries where human cases of H5N1 virus infection were recorded since 1997 are indicated in shades of green. HPAI H5N1 viruses represent the only lineage of HPAI viruses that are enzootic in poultry in many parts of the world. they are exceptional in the diversity of species they infect, by the high incidence of zoonotic events and the severity of human infections that they cause. the closure of live poultry markets in Shanghai reduced the mean daily number of human H7N9 virus infections by 99%. both the second and third waves coincide with the influenza season in china. both the second and third waves coincide with the influenza season in china. human infections with H7N9 and HPAI H5N1 are typified by severe respiratory insufficiency and the development of ARDS. in the later stage there is also type II hyperplasia, interstitial infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells and fibrosis. in vitro infection of primary human macrophages and alveolar epithelial cells suggests that while H7N9 viruses are more potent inducers of pro-inflammatory cytokines than H1N1 viruses, neither virus strain is as potent as HPAI H5N1 viruses. damage may occur indirectly via the recruitment of specific leukocyte subsets to lung. virus histochemistry has shown that HPAI H5N1 viruses attach predominantly to non-ciliated cuboidal cells (club cells) in the bronchiole and type II pneumocytes and alveolar macrophages in the alveoli [24], [112], [113], [114], [115]. avian viruses can cause severe disease in humans by infecting the cells in the lower respiratory tract, but this lower respiratory tract binding pattern limits their transmissibility. both studies found two other mutations in the viral HA during ferret passage. these mutations affected the stability of HA or resulted in the loss of a potential N-linked glycosylation site close to the receptor binding site, thereby increasing virus binding to sialic acid receptors. the pH of fusion of many avian influenza viruses is higher (less acidic) than that of human influenza viruses. mutations that were identified in the HA of airborne H5N1 viruses (H110Y, T318I, H3 numbering) stabilized the HA protein, as demonstrated by a lower pH of fusion, and a higher temperature stability [122], [123] an unmodified avian influenza virus with a relative unstable HA may be inactivated by a premature, pH-triggered conformational change before it can bind and enter its target cell in the respiratory tract. a balanced approach After virus replication, the receptor-destroying activity of the NA protein facilitates the release of newly formed virus particles from the cell surface. PB2 was the first polymerase protein in which a mutation helped overcome this host restriction was identified. avian influenza A virus isolates contain almost exclusively a glutamic acid at position 627 of the polymerase PB2 protein (PB2-E627) mutation is accompanied by improved viral replication at low temperatures [135], [136] and enhanced binding of the viral polymerase to the nucleoprotein in human-derived isolates. avian PB1 may also restrict the human-to-human spread of avian influenza viruses. other mutations in the viral nucleoprotein can reduce sensitivity of avian influenza viruses to the human protein MxA which possess strong antiviral activity. PB2-E627K, PB2-D701N, PB1-H99Y and likely PB2-Q591R could be conclusively associated with efficient transmission and therefore successful adaptation. the programme PyMOL was used to assign the indicated subunits PB2, PB1, PA and the influenza A virus promoter in dark grey, grey, light grey and yellow. of particular concern are the HPAI H5N1 and LPAI H7N9 virus strains due to the frequency of zoonoses and/or severity of disease they cause. countries where human cases of H5N1 virus infection were recorded since 1997 are indicated in shades of green.
