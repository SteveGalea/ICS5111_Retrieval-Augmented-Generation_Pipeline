{"summary": "coronaviruses are members of the order Nidovirales and family Coronaviridae which are made up of single-stranded positive sense RNA genomes. they are divided into four genera namely Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus. in 2003, a coronavirus belonging to the Alphacoronavirus genus was discovered in an infant in the Netherlands. HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have no known intermediate mammalian hosts. coronavirus NL63 is known to use the same receptor as SARS-CoV. this assertion is yet to be explored through surveillance data. target farms were shortlisted and visited to engage and sensitize the farm owners, family, and workers as well as the entire community. participants were allowed to ask questions and were encouraged to seek clarification on issues they were not convinced about. median age of participants in the study was 34 years (range 13 to 77 years) swine, sheep, and goat sera were tested directly with a recombinant immunofluorescence assay. a selection of coronavirus-characterized serum samples was used for assay optimization. all serum samples were heat inactivated at 56 \u00b0C for 30 min before testing. fresh Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (GibcoTM), Thermo Fisher, US) supplemented with 10% Fetal calf serum (FCS) was added after infection. flasks were incubated at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2 and harvested on day seven. western blot analysis for western blot analysis, 21 L of the ultracentrifuge purified viral protein was treated with 7 L of NuPAGE\u00ae Laemmli sample buffer (4) (Thermo Fisher, US) the membrane was washed with PBS-T and incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G. dilution series of antigen ranging from 12 g/mL to 0.1875 g/mL and conjugate ranging from 1:500 to 1:4000 were tested. the determined optimal conjugate dilution for human testing was used as a starting concentration for determination of optimal conjugate dilution for livestock testing. plates were washed 5 times with 0.1% PBS-T then blocked with 5% milk powder. after one-hour incubation, plates were washed 5 times with PBS-T. goat anti-human antibody was labelled with horseradish peroxidase enzyme. serum samples were tested at a 1:40 dilution for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. secondary detection was performed with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-human antibody. each sample was spotted onto transfected and non-transfected cells. the number of samples with optical density values above the 75th, 80th, 85th, 90th, and 95th percentile optical density values constituted the top 25, 20, 15, 10 and 5 percent most reactive samples respectively. a livestock distribution beeswarm plot was generated using R statistical package version 3.4.3. a whole-virus enzyme linked immunosorbent assay was developed to test for HCoV-NL63 in livestock as part of a two-stage testing algorithm also involving a recombinant immunofluorescence assay. for a sample to be considered positive for HCoV-NL63, it had to be in the top 5% most reactive samples as determined with the whole-virus ELISA. high-titer virus stocks produced by ultracentrifugation using a 20% sucrose cushion. ultracentrifuge-purified virus was inactivated in a 6-well tissue culture plate with 0.1% beta-Propiolactone (ACROS OrganicsTM, Thermo Fisher, US) the viral protein and a two-fold serial dilution of a protein standard (bovine serum albumin, Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) were mixed with Bradford solution (Coomassie PlusTM, Thermo Fischer, US) and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. protein quantity was subsequently measured on a spectrophotometer (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) at 595 nm. oxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) for 1 h at room temperature. the membrane was analyzed with a chemiluminescent substrate, SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate kit. viral protein was coated into 96-well Nunc MicroWellTM plates. plates were washed 5 times with 0.1% PBS-T then blocked with 5% milk powder in PBS-T for one hour at room temperature. HCoV-NL63 Virus Culture for ELISA Antigen high-titer virus stocks were produced by growing the wild-type virus on Rhesus monkey kidney epithelial cells. a 1:17 dilution (v/v) of high-titer virus stock in 162 cm2 cell culture flasks was prepared and used to infect the cells for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. purified virus was inactivated in a 6-well tissue culture plate with 0.1% beta-Propiolactone (ACROS OrganicsTM, Thermo Fisher, US) the virus was then grown on LLC-MK2 cells and checked by quantitative real-time PCR. the membrane was washed with PBS-T and incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) the membrane was then analyzed with a chemiluminescent substrate, SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate kit. serum samples were obtained from the lab of Prof. Christian Drosten. different substrate exposure times were also tested to determine the most optimal duration. recombinant immunofluorescence testing was conducted as previously described. recombinant immunofluorescence assay was conducted as previously described. each sample was spotted onto transfected cells to help distinguish autofluorescence from fluorescence due to immune reactions. permission for livestock sampling was also obtained from the wildlife division of the Ghana Forestry Commission. the northern region was the source of majority of goat samples (n = 117, 36.6%) and majority of the cattle samples were obtained from the Volta region (n = 76, 46.6%). analysis of Virus Protein Western Blot Analysis was performed to confirm the identity and immunogenicity of two major structural proteins of HCoV-NL63 in the concentrated virus antigen. there was a two-fold reduction in average optical density (OD) measured using the HCoV-NL63-rIFA-positive test serum on coating concentration range 0.75 g/mL to 0.1875 g/mL. there was no consistent variation in average OD of the HCoV-NL63-rIFA-positive serum sample tested with coating concentrations exceeding 0.75 g/mL. as such, this value was chosen as the coating concentration for the assay. the reactivity was similarly higher for the 15-min incubation time. the 15-min incubation time was selected for higher sensitivity. the 1:2000 conjugate dilution was also found to be optimal for livestock sera testing. different degrees of cross-reactivity with HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 were observed with a higher level with HCoV-229E than with HCoV-OC43. there was a statistically significant difference (U = 27.50, p 0.001) as determined by the Mann\u2013Whitney U test. 217 samples were determined to be unequivocal positives and negatives by two independent assessors. these were samples that did not produce significant background noise and autofluorescence to hinder result determination. a comparison of the mean OD values of rIFA positive and negative groups showed no statistically significant difference between the groups. the most reactive sheep, goat, and swine samples were tested with the developed ELISA. the optical density values for the livestock testing ranged from 0.0 to 0.32 for sheep, 0.02 to 0.68 for goats, and 0.04 to 0.74 for swine. the majority of people sampled were in the Ashanti region (n = 83, 33.5%) and the fewest in the Brong Ahafo region (n = 16, 6.5%). a total of 1321 serum samples from 397 pigs, 422 sheep, 320 goats, 163 cattle, and 19 donkeys was collected. the membrane protein of the control was, however, less prominent than that of the test virus protein (Figure 2). the approximate molecular masses of the two structural proteins and their detection by the respective primary antibodies confirmed their identity and immunogenicity. purified HCoV-NL63 antigen (lane 1) compared to HCoV-NL63 protein recovered from transfected LLC-MK2 whole cell lysate (lane 2). there was a two-fold reduction in average optical density (OD) measured using the HCoV-NL63-rIFA-positive serum on coating concentration range 0.75 g/mL to 0.1875 g/mL (Figure 3A) the 15-min substrate incubation time produced higher reactivity for serum 1 with a median (interquartile range) OD of 0.338 (0.236 to 0.344) compared to the 5-min incubation time with 0.187 (0.163 to 0.191) the reactivity was similarly higher for the 15-min incubation time with a median (interquartile range) OD of 0.06 (0.025 to 0.099) than the 5-min incubation time with 0.187 ( potential cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses was assessed. similar degrees of cross-reactivity with HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 were also assessed. ELISA with HCoV-NL63-rIFA test of human samples. 217 samples were determined to be unequivocal positives and negatives. 183 (84.3%) were positive and 34 (15.7%) were negative. HCoV-NL63-rIFA-tested human samples tested positive by immunofluorescence testing. the optical density values ranged from 0.0 to 0.32 for sheep, 0.02 to 0.68 for goats, and 0.04 to 0.74 for swine. the recombinant immunofluorescence assay described in this study is a robust, sensitive, and specific assay. the assay is a robust, sensitive, and specific assay, but is not suitable for use on a large scale. lack of cross-reactivity between HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43 has been reported by other studies that employed recombinant ELISAs targeting the nucleocapsid protein. despite the fact discrimination was possible in the present study using the whole virus antigen, some degree of cross-reactivity was also observed. the nucleocapsid protein is produced abundantly during infection. it is employed in assay development because it is a potent immunogen. the membrane protein is more abundant in the complete virion particle than nucleocapsid protein. human coronavirus NL63 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 receptor for infection of target cells similar to SARS-CoV [20] and has been found to be able to replicate in swine cells in vitro. there have not been any reports of HCoV-NL63-related viruses circulating in Ghanaian bats. recombination events between canine coronavirus and transmissible gastroenteritis virus and canine coronavirus and feline coronavirus have brought about new coronaviruses. these new viruses may have a different host range especially if changes occur in the spike region or different pathology in the same host."}
