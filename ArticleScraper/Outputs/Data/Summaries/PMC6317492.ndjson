{"summary": "the main objective of this paper was to draw attention to commissioned research that has been previously published and deposited as open access publications as listed in the references. the findings were combined with the experience of Wellcome Trust and TDR to develop recommendations for how research funders might improve the compliance with data sharing policies. researchers in low resource settings feel that the requirements to share data risk turning them into data exporters unless greater efforts are made to ensure a fairer distribution of benefits. authors draw on their experience working for Wellcome Trust and TDR - the special programme for research and training in tropical diseases. researchers in low- and middle-income countries highlight an inequity created by the disadvantage as they see it by the blanket requirements to share their data. they fear the reality for them will be far from fair 6\u2013 8. the year 2003 was chosen as the start date for the review as this was the year of the last major SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak. the world health organization held a global meeting on the epidemiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) the second survey was designed to identify which technical \u2018standards\u2019 were being used in data sharing infrastructure relating to neglected diseases. only two trials out of 58 provided any link in their registry entry to the background data 1, 2. a lack of confidence in the utility of the data and therefore unwillingness to invest resources to prepare it to be shared. a similar scepticism about how data might be used or misused, the potential harms to patients and the risks to the researcher sharing data that might reveal errors. health research funders have a generic policy requiring research data to be shared in a manner that maximises health and societal benefit. the main barrier to sharing is not technical but cultural, with researchers remaining sceptical about the benefits to their data. research funders should take stock and revise data sharing policies to provide incentive structures for researchers. one clear first step would be to engage early with the researchers and related stakeholders to understand their concerns. there are very few evidence-based case studies that describe clearly the public health benefit that was achieved following the sharing of research data. funders need to work with researchers and their networks to support the technical work required to develop standards that enable inter-operability. a contributory role for funders would be to systematically collect the data management plans that they have requested as part of funding grants."}
