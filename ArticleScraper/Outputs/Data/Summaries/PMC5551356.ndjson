{"summary": "GKSQDT is composed of baicalin and andrographolide. its severe bitterness limits application of patients. common masking methods are unsuitable for GKSQDT. new tab abbreviations used: AURTIs: Acute Upper Respiratory Tract Infections; GSQDT: Gankeshuangqing Dispersible Tablets; IR: Infrared Spectrogram; LHPC: Low-substituted Hydroxypropyl Cellulose; CAs: Contact Angle; FTIR: Fourier Transform Infrared Spectra. drug and bitter taste receptors on taste cells are combined to produce stimulations in oral cavity. one way is by adding sweet taste substances, flavors, or effervescent agents to interfere with the perception of bitter drugs. another is slowing down or stopping drug release in oral cavity. particle coating technology uses force to combine several drugs or excipients particles to form composite according to certain structural models to change property of drug. particle coating technology was adopted to mask bitter taste of GKSQDT. material and reagents Baicalin (purity 80%, No. 100102) and andrographolide (purity 99%, No. 120812) were purchased from Sichuan Yuxin Medicine Co., Ltd., (Sichuan, China) caSO4 (No. 20100908), SiO2 of pharmaceutical grade (No. 20110813), and ethanol (No. 20110703) were purchased from Chengdu Kelong Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., ( about 10 g of baicalin was sampled at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 min d0.5 of these samples were measured to observe the variation with time using an MS2000 particle size analyzer. d0.5 represents the number of particles smaller than a particular particle size accounts for 50% of total particles. volunteers were asked to give scores on a scale of 1\u20134.[30] The taste aggregate score S was calculated as S = 1 N1 + 2 N2 + 3 N3 + 4 N4. the smaller total point was; the lower bitterness was. the response intensity of each sensor was measured with an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. the potentiometric differences between each coated sensor and the reference electrode contribute to the intensity value of the measured samples. each sample was replicated 10 times. Totally,16 rats were randomly classified into two groups. the original tablets and taste-masked tablets group were randomly classified into two groups. the protocol and experimental designs were approved by the Ethical Committee of Affiliated Hospital of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. participants were received written consent on the study's purpose and of their right to keep information confidential. 300 g of baicalin was grinded in an SYFM-8II micronizing pharmaceutical vibrating mill. about 10 g of baicalin was sampled at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 min d0.5 of these samples were measured to observe the variation with time using an MS2000 particle size analyzer. d0.5 represents the number of particles smaller than a particular particle size accounts for 50% of total particles. volunteers were asked to give scores on a scale of 1\u20134.[30] The taste aggregate score S was calculated as S = 1 N1 + 2 N2 + 3 N3 + 4 N4. d0.5 represents the number of particles smaller than a particular particle size accounts for 50% of total particles. d0.5 represents the number of particles smaller than a particular particle size accounts for 50% of total particles. was calculated as S = 1 N1 + 2 N2 + 3 N3 + 4 N4 (N1 + N2 + N3 + N4 = 20 volunteers) the smaller total point was; the lower bitterness was. four kinds of sample were compressed each about 0.2 g into tablets with pressure between 50 N and 60 N. water was used as test liquid, and the rate was controlled at 0.3 L/s. every sample was measured 5 times. male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats weighing 180\u2013200 g were obtained from the Institute of Laboratory Animals of Sichuan Provincial People\u2019 Hospital (Permit No. SCXK (chuan) 2013\u20132015, Chengdu, China. a drop of approximately 10 mL of sample was applied on the upper surface of tongue while the sample was water suspension of GKSQDT and taste-masked tablets. every volunteer tastes each sample 1 time to avoid fatigue. male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats weighing 180\u2013200 g were obtained from the Institute of Laboratory Animals of Sichuan Provincial People\u2019 Hospital. rats were housed in plastic cages under standard conditions (23.5\u00b0C 1.5\u00b0C, under a 12-h light\u2013dark cycle with lights on at 8:00 am. all possible steps were taken to avoid animals\u2019 suffering at any stage of the experiments. human sensory test The procedure of this test was similar to \u201cCoting time of composite\u201d. a drop of approximately 10 mL of sample was applied on the upper surface of tongue. each volunteer tastes each sample 1 time to avoid fatigue. composite coated at 9 min were slightly bitterer than 6 min. the final coating time was determined at 6 min. it could be known that composite was less bitter than mixture. FTIR spectra of baicalin showed OH stretchings at 3600 cm1 and 3500 cm1, a C=O stretching absorption at 1684 cm1, and C= stretching at 1609 cm1, 1573 cm1, 1551 cm1, and 1496 cm1. Peaks at 1066 cm1 indicate the stretching of C-O-C glycosidic bond. the preference index of taste-masked tablets was higher than original tablets. both groups showed concentration-dependent decreases in intakes and preferences. the bitterness level of taste-masked samples was lower than original. composite coated at 9 min were slightly bitterer than 6 min as some composite was destroyed. it could be known that composite was less bitter than mixture, and the coating time affected bitterness level. composite had a similar absorption with baicalin at 1609 cm1, 1573 cm1, 1551 cm1, and 1066 cm1. FTIR spectra showed several intense bands in the region between 4000 and 400 cm1. gue sensor data showed that the Euclidean distance between original tablets and baicalin was smaller than that between taste-masked tablets and andrographolide. it may indicate that taste-masked tablets were less bitter than original tablets. characterizations of baicalin, andrographolide, mixture, and composite were produced. results showed taste-masked tablets were less bitter than original tablets. pharmacological effects of taste-masked GKSQDT were still unknown. pharmacodynamics will be researched in further study. financial support and sponsorship This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 81403115, 81274098)"}
