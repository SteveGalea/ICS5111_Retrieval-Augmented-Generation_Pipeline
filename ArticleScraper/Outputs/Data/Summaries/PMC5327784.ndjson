{"summary": "a \u201cdisease\u201d is any condition that impairs the normal function of a body organ and/or system, of the psyche, or of the organism as a whole. intrinsic factors arise from within the host and may be due to the genetic features of an organism or any disorder within the host that interferes with normal functional processes of a body organ and/or system. infectious diseases emerge at some point in time in a given population and in a given context or environment. pathogens are able to acquire properties that enable them to reinfect their original or new hosts, usually in increasingly alarming proportions. the term is used in reference to diseases of infectious origin and whose incidence in humans has either increased within the past two decades or threatens to increase in the near future [11]. a 1992 report by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) on emerging infections, which underscored the microbial threats to health in the united states [1, 2, 12, 13], provided the impetus for current widespread attention on emerging and reemerging infectious diseases. genetic recombination, or reassortment, and factors that compel microbial agents to change reservoir hosts constitute opportunities for infectious agents to evolve, adapt to new hosts in new ecological niches. factors affecting the environment include depletion of forests, expansion and modernization of agricultural practices, and natural disasters such as floods. at least 25% of about 60 million deaths worldwide each year are estimated to be due to infectious diseases. the scourge of emerging IDs is also well known since ancient times. in the 18th century, smallpox killed an estimated 400,000 Europeans each year. in the 20th century, it was responsible for an estimated 300\u2013500 million deaths. no other infectious disease has ever claimed as many lives as the 1918-1919 Spanish influenza pandemic. it killed more people in one year than in four years of the black Death Bubonic Plague that occurred in 1347\u20131351. it has been referred to as the most devastating epidemic recorded in world history and a global disaster. ifampicin, streptomycin/amikacin, or surgery Early detection and antibiotic treatment Chagas disease Trypanosoma cruzi (protozoan parasite) Vector-borne Cardiac or mixed alterations in chronic infection 8 M people infected worldwide, mostly Latin America Curable with benznidazole and nifurtimox Vector (triatomine bug) control Dengue and chikungunya Dengue virus sp. foodborne trematodiases Trematode parasite sp.

impaired kidney function, internal /external bleeding, and nervous system problems (MHF) About 80% of infections are asymptomatic. hosts Awareness EVD: good hygiene; avoid contact with blood and body fluids MERS. avoid consumption of raw or undercooked animal products. avoid contact with infected secretions, excretions, blood, or tissues of infected pigs and bats. the 2014 west africa ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak originated at Meliandou. it is close to an area where the three countries, Guinea, Sierra Leone, and liberia, share common borders. the WHO convened a meeting of scientists and public health experts in Geneva on 8-9 December, 2015. the prioritization was based on a number of factors bordering on the likelihood to cause severe outbreaks necessitating public health emergency in the near future and inadequacy or nonavailability of medical countermeasures. the seventh disease, denoted as a new disease thus refers to any hitherto unknown disease that may emerge. the flaviviruses, dengue and chikungunya are on the WHO current list of neglected tropical diseases. details about 16 current most neglected tropical diseases are given in Table 3. public health response EIDs and neglected infectious diseases are both driven to a large extent by human, environmental, and ecological factors. at least US$ 785 million pledge was made by members towards attainment of the goals of the London Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases. this is unprecedented in terms of disease management, preventive chemotherapy, vector control, and pesticide management. veterinary public health services are some of the public health strategies employed by the WHO for the control, elimination, and eradication of NTDs. nucleic acid detection and genome sequencing technology in the nineteenth century has revolutionized infectious disease research, especially pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment. a number of molecular assays have been developed for the detection, characterization, and quantitation of the ever-increasing number of infectious pathogens at a faster rate and with higher sensitivity and specificity as compared to traditional methods. advances in molecular diagnostics and sequencing technology have played pivotal role in the control of many infectious diseases. measurement of plasma HIV-1 viral load is an important technique for monitoring treatment efficacy. viral gene sequencing is a crucial method by which drug resistance development is monitored in HIV-infected persons on antiretroviral therapy. bacavir (ABC) is associated with drug hypersensitivity reactions. it may lead to high rates of myocardial infarction in patients who are positive for human leukocyte antigen type B5701 allele. notable milestones have been achieved in the global sociopolitical front in addressing infectious disease problems. despite significant advances, new and more virulent pathogens continue to emerge and reemerge. new and more virulent pathogens continue to emerge and reemerge. new and more virulent pathogens continue to emerge and reemerge. pathogenesis studies did not find significant association between change in the virus with the magnitude of the outbreak, suggesting factors extrinsic to the virus to be responsible. there is no promise that advances in infectious disease detection and control strategies can successfully stop new diseases from appearing. elimination of a disease once it gains way into human population is a hard task that deserves all persistent efforts to terminate its persistence. there are currently at least 25 anti-HIV compounds licensed for the treatment of AIDS [110]. 9.3. Surveillance This nature of infectious disease challenge calls for constant surveillance and timely intervention. there is also the need for necessary infrastructure and skilled personnel to support prompt diagnosis and research to aid development of effective countermeasures. the IDs emergence threat thus persists as long as pathogens continue to undergo genetic changes. virulence of pathogenic microorganisms may be caused by factors other than genetic variation. there is no promise that advances in infectious disease detection and control strategies can successfully stop new diseases from appearing. ART is necessary to suppress plasma HIV viremia, restore immunologic function, and reduce likelihood of drug resistance development for favorable treatment outcomes. emergence of drug resistant microbes and resistance to antimicrobial agents characterizes many bacterial infectious agents such as Escherichia coli, Pneumococcus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Staphylococcus aureus. emerging infectious disease outbreaks can have serious social, political, and economic effects. a complex number of factors relating to human behaviour and activities have contributed to infectious disease emergence and transmission."}
