{"summary": "LRTI (primarily pneumonia) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide in infants and children. there are approximately 2 million children die from ARTIs each year. atypical pathogens are also important cause of LRTI. studies have shown that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza viruses (Flu) are important pathogens among the hospitalized and outpatient children presenting with ARTI. the etiology of LRTI can be established in only 30\u201350% of cases using conventional methods. unidentified etiology causes inappropriate antibiotic usage, antibiotic resistance, unintended adverse reactions and increased cost. a total of 39,756 hospitalized children with ARTIs were enrolled in this study prospectively. the respiratory tract infections were divided into upper and lower respiratory tract infections. the symptoms of upper and lower respiratory tract infections include fever, cough, sore throat, tonsillitis, pharyngitis, and herpangina. blood samples were collected in vacuum blood tubes without the addition of anticoagulants. Specimens were stored at 70\u00b0C if analysis was not possible within 24 h. each slide has 10 wells, each containing one of the above agent antigens. a single-tailed P-value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. a linear regression test was used to evaluate the correlation between the proportion of mixed infections and the incidence of multi-pathogen infections. infected patients with one or more of the symptoms were included in the study. Specimens Blood samples were collected from children before clinical treatment. blood samples were collected in vacuum blood tubes without the addition of anticoagulants. Statistical analyses were performed using statistics analysis system (SAS) version 9.0, Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS) version 13.0, and Microsoft Excel 2007. a single-tailed P-value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. of the 39,756 patients, 25.7% (10,206) were positive for one or more respiratory pathogens (Fig. 1A and Table 1). M. pneumoniae was the most frequent pathogen (19.1%, n = 7585), followed by AdV (4.8%, n = 1,898), IBV (4.7%, n = 1,851), RSV (2.0%, n = 788), and PIV (1.4%, n = 571). pneumoniae 39756 22 0.1 0.2 C. burnetii 39756 10 0.0 0.1 Multiple infections 39756 2391 6.0 23.4 IBV + M. pneumoniae 39756 630 1.6 6.2 AdV + M. pneumoniae 39756 620 1.6 6.1 RSV + M. pneumoniae 39756 219 0.6 2.1 PIV + M. pneumoniae 39756 219 0.6 2.1 PIV + M. pneumoniae 39756 219 BV + PIV 39756 9 0.0 0.1 AdV + IAV + M. pneumoniae + L. pneumophila 39756 7 0.0 0.1 AdV + RSV + PIV + M. pneumoniae + L. pneumophila 39756 7 0.0 0.1 AdV + RSV + PIV 39756 4 0.0 0.0 IBV + RSV + PIV + M. pneumoniae 39756 3 0.0 0.0 IAV + PIV + M. pneumoniae 76.6% were mono-infections (n = 7815) and 23.4% were co-infections or multiple infections (n = 2,395). 83.5% were co-infections involving two pathogens (n = 1,996). 15.7% were multiple infections involving three pathogens (n = 376) M. pneumoniae, AdV, IBV, RSV, PIV, and L. pneumophila were detected throughout the surveillance period.

ANOVA showed no significant difference between different k coefficients for different agents, seasons, and age groups. the k coefficients for different age groups slightly differed from each other, but not significantly. the k coefficients for different months were similar, with no statistically significant differences (P = 0.499) further regression analysis showed a linear relationship between the proportion of mixed infections and the incidence of the pathogen lower in proportion than the other pathogen involved in the co-infection. 25.7% of inpatient children aged 16 years with ARTIs were infected by at least one respiratory pathogen. multi-pathogen infections were also detected, with M. pneumoniae as the most frequently involved agent. an epidemiologic study found that influenza viral infection occurred throughout the year with no seasonal predominance. this is probably related to the increased risk of infection in school-age children due to encounters with contagious individuals. some studies suggest extensive damage to the epithelium of the respiratory tract might promote superinfection by another virus. the k coefficients showed no significant differences according to pathogen, month, or age group. the k coefficients showed no significant differences according to pathogen, month, or age group. multiple viral infections were frequent in children with ARTIs. a linear relationship between the proportion of mixed infections and the incidence of the pathogens involved."}
