{"summary": "the availability of large-scale genomic datasets focused on host-pathogen interactions can be used to find novel drug targets as well as potential opportunities for drug repositioning. 67 common biological pathways were identified among the seven different respiratory viruses analyzed. bronchiolitis, acute otitis, sinusitis, croup, community-acquired pneumonia, and exacerbation of both chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma. prevalence of pandemic Orthomyxoviridae Influenza A Virus from April 2009 to 2010 was estimated to be approximately 60 million cases, 270,000 hospitalizations, and 12,000 deaths. respiratory viruses trigger similar inflammatory responses such as interleukin-6 (HUGO gene name IL6), interleukin-8 (IL8) and interleukin-11 (IL11) and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (CSF2) these inflammatory responses in turn initiate IgA production, B cell differentiation and T cell stimulation [12]\u2013[16]. human targets might be less susceptible to the evolution of drug resistance due to constraints on the virus to find alternative host pathways for its proliferation several recent studies have generated multiple mRNA microarray gene expression datasets derived from experiments involving the infection of human cell-lines or animal models with one or more of the major respiratory viruses. we identified common sets of genes and pathways involved in host responses to viral infections.

Kauffmann and Huber have demonstrated improvements in signal-to-noise ratios after performing post normalization QC analysis. parkin-UPS pathway ubiquinates proteins encoded by septin 5 (SEPT5) [48], tubulin alpha and beta [49], and the glycosylated form of synuclein, alpha (SNCAIP) [50] for degradation by the 26S proteasome. parkin-UPS pathway is not commonly associated with general immune response to viral infection. at least one factor in the progression of Parkinson's disease is the formation of neuotoxic Lewy bodies due to increases in SNCA. increase in SNCA are believed to be the result of loss-of-function mutations in PARK2 which cause disruption in the protein's localization and solubility. the drugs associated with this gene list do not have current indications as anti-viral therapies. Pranlukast and Clenbuterol are prescribed for relief of lung disorders such as bronchospasm after allergic reactions and asthma bronchoconstriction. IL1B is cleaved into its active form by the protease CASP1 after which it activates the NLRP3 inflammasome [29]\u2013[31], [69]. IL1B is consistently up regulated across CMV, FLU, HRV, MPENU and RSV. amrinone is a type 3 pyridine phosphodiesterase inhibitor used in the treatment of congestive heart failure and is an inhibitor of TNF. phosphodiesterase inhibitors have been shown to alter immune response [75]\u2013[78] and, in one case, specifically through TNF [79]. indirect evidence suggests that armirone may be beneficial in respiratory viral infection situations by inhibiting TNF via type 4 phosphodiesterase. caspase 1 (CASP1) inhibits tubulin-beta formation. inhibiting tubulin-beta formation may reduce viral proliferation. increases in neuronal class III TUBB occur after COX infection. some proteins are beneficial if up-regulated during initial viral infection. but have detrimental effects if over-activated for prolonged periods. study suggests several potential human-host proteins that could be targets of future therapeutics. the concept of data improvement after outlier removal applies regardless of the QC analysis approach. of the top twenty enriched pathways, eighteen are associated with immune response. of the top twenty enriched pathways, eighteen are associated with immune response. PARK2 ubiquinates proteins encoded by septin 5 (SEPT5) [48], tubulin alpha and beta [49], and the glycosylated form of synuclein, alpha (SNCAIP) [50] for degradation by the 26S proteasome. other ubiquitylation proteins, such as ISG15, play roles in host defense [55], [56] polymorphisms in the gene PARK2 have also been associated with susceptibility to infectious diseases such as leprosy, typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever. the exact mechanism is still unclear [63], [64]. links between FLU and other neurodegenerative diseases have been suggested. eight of the ten drug repurposing gene targets are involved in activation of the innate immune response. the remaining two have some evidence of virus modulation. potential drug repurposing opportunities for IL1B, tNF, and MMP9 are discussed below. TNF knock-out phenotypes include abnormal immune system physiology, increased susceptibility to viral infection, and both increased and decreased susceptibility to bacterial infection. some cases where partial TNF inhibition provides a clinical benefit in patients with viral complications. amrinone is known to modulate pro- and anti-inflammatory factors in endotoxin-stimulated cells [80] phosphodiesterase inhibitors have been used to treat RSV-induced airway hyper-responsiveness and lung eosinophilia. indirect evidence suggests that Armirone may be beneficial in respiratory viral infection situations by inhibiting TNF via type 4 phosphodiesterase. a CASP1 inhibitor such as Minocycline could be used to increase PARK2 ubiquitinase activity, in turn decreasing the TUBA or TUBB availability. a CASP1 inhibitor would have an antagonist relationship with IL1B, hence the inflammasome. further, CASP1 inhibitors would be agonists for PARK2. interleukin 1 beta (IL1B) is a cytokine involved in inflammatory response, cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. IL1B is specifically cleaved into its active form by the protease CASP1 after which it activates the NLRP3 inflammasome. over-expression of IL1B causes multiple inflammatory disorders. this drug inhibits TNF-alpha by blocking macrophage cysteinyl leukotriene 1 receptors or suppression of NF-kappa B activation [73] Pranlukast has been shown to be beneficial in cases of respiratory syncytial virus postbronchiolitis, but also in a wide variety of other diseases with strong inflammatory complications. IL1B is an activator of the NLRP3 inflammasome [85]. blocking MMP9 may also reduce inflammatory damage by down-regulating the inflammasome. inhibiting tubulin-beta formation may reduce viral proliferation. inhibition may prove beneficial in terms of increasing inflammatory responses, it is ambiguous in terms of benefit for bacterial infections. more study is needed specifically on the role of caspase and tubulin in host response to respiratory virus infection. all analyzed GEO datasets contain at least one \u201ctreatment group\u201d and \u201ccontrol group\u201d. the dataset must contain at least 3 samples per treatment or control group. the dataset must contain at least one wild-type infection treatment group. prior to quality control (QC) analysis, we pre-screened and pre-processed each dataset. normalized raw data and the study design table were imported from the GEO databases. samples irrelevant to the main study design were marked for segregation. each probe within a comparison group must have a p-value 0.05 after general linear model test and a fold change in either direction of 1.5. to be considered differentially expressed, each probe within a comparison group must have a p-value 0.05 after general linear model test. the top five significant pathways and an additional pathway representing a unique mechanism were further analyzed. with each map, proteins were labeled according to the number of viruses in which the transcript was differentially expressed thus yielding the viral frequency for that protein. of the differentially expressed proteins modulated by 5 or more respiratory viruses were obtained from the DrugBank database, version 3.0 (http://www.drugbank.ca/ accessed August 2011) [29]\u2013[31]. we only considered those drugs that were launched products with experimental and clinical evidence of direct interaction with gene product. syncytial virus, Bunyaviridae Hantavirus and Sin nombre virus were analyzed. all analyzed GEO datasets contain at least one \u201ctreatment group\u201d and \u201ccontrol group\u201d. a particular dataset may have more than one comparison group. the QC analysis assessed each sample for kernel density, PCA, MAD, and pair-wise Pearson correlation. each comparison group was treated separately, regardless of dataset origination. mRNA Array Expression and Pathway Analysis. each probe within a comparison group must have a p-value 0.05 after general linear model test and a fold change in either direction of 1.5. the differentially expressed probe list became the differentially expressed gene list for each comparison group. each comparison group must contain pathways that have a p-value 0.01. the top five significant pathways and an additional pathway representing a unique mechanism were further analyzed. with each map, the proteins were labeled according to the number of viruses in which the transcript was differentially expressed thus yielding the viral frequency for that protein. additional evidence of mechanism of action was obtained from immune or infection-related Jackson Laboratory knock-in/knock-out mouse (JAX) phenotype. supporting information Figure S1 Sample of quality analysis for subset of GSE17156: RSV treatment and control groups using MAD score and correlations. vertical axis shows clustering of 1,274 genes differentially expressed in at least 7 of the 28 comparisons. yellow indicates a fold change value of 3.0 or greater; blue indicates a fold change value of 3.0 or less; white indicates a fold change value of 0.0. horizontal axis contains each of the 28 different comparisons labeled by virus, GSE and time point. blue circles are differential expression of genes by 5 viruses. red circles are differential expression of genes by 7 viruses, orange circles are differential expression of genes by at least 6 viruses. blue circles are differential expression of genes by 5 viruses.
