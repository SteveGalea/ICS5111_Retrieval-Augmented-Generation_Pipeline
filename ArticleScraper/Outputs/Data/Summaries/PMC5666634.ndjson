{"summary": "STRUCTURE-BASED CONFORMATIONAL STABILIZATION STRATEGY FOR RSV is a member of the paramyxoviradae family of viruses. it infects most children during their first year of life, is responsible for 7% of deaths 1 month to 1 year of age. in the elderly, it induces the same degree of excess mortality as influenza virus. we determined the prefusion structure of RSV F, in complex with the D25 antibody (McLellan et al. 2013b) we used structure-based design to stabilize the metastable prefusion state by adding a disulfide bond (DS) and cavity-filling mutations (Cav1) immunogenicity indicated the prefusion F-stabilized \u201cDS-Cav1\u201d variant to elicit highly protective titers in mice and macaques, a finding h structure-based strategies developed for RSV may succeed with viruses that evade by conformational change. many viruses do not use structural rearrangements to evade the humoral immune response. a potential approach involves clues from antibodies identified from natural infection. the Vaccine Research Center has proposed the expansion of this approach to include considerations of the B-cell ontogeny by which effective antibodies are generated. if protective immunity occurs through different mechanisms of recognition or are created by different immunological processes, then B-cell ontogeny strategies based on \u201cre-eliciting\u201d similar antibodies in the general population may flounder. three multidonor classes of antibodies capable of neutralizing diverse strains of influenza A from both group 1 and group 2 subtypes. two of these multidonor classes, one derived from the VH6-1 germline gene with a D3-3 recombination and another from the VH1-18 germline gene with a (Q-x-x-V) motif, appeared substantially induced by both seasonal and divergent H5 immunization. ification of multidonor flu antibodies, coupled with structure-based strategies of germline priming, provides an exciting approach to developing a universal influenza A vaccine. three multidonor classes of antibody (purple, orange, and green) were identified in subjects from the VRC 310 trial. pathogen uses structural biology to create immunogens that overcome each of these evasion mechanisms. structure-based solutions to each of these viral mechanisms of evasion have been proposed. multidimensional searching can be all-encompassing, but this says little about which dimensions provide the most efficient means to find a solution. a 600-residue glycoprotein might be the solution to the HIV vaccine problem; however, it may be exceedingly difficult to identify this solution in the 20600 potential solutions. the most important parameter governing the elicitation of neutralizing antibodies against a pathogen is likely to be the immune-evasion parameter preventing antibodies from being elicited by that pathogen. the most important parameter governing the elicitation of neutralizing antibodies against a particular pathogen is likely to be the immune-evasion parameter preventing antibodies from being elicited."}
