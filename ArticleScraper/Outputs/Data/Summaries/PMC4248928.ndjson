IL-1 from signaling through the IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) increased significantly at 7 dpi (P 0.001) concentration of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) steadily increased from 7 dpi and peaked at 28 dpi (P 0.001). SVV acute infection also led to the upregulation of wound healing and growth factors in the lungs. the frequency of DCs in PBMC significantly increased at 7 (P 0.01) and 14 (P 0.001) dpi compared to baseline. the frequency of monocytes in PBMC increased significantly at 7 dpi (P 0.001) and returned to baseline levels by 14 dpi. in PBMC, we detected a significant increase in pDC frequency at 7 dpi (P 0.05) ans SEM of dendritic cells (DCs; lin CD14 HLA-DR+) and monocytes (lin CD14+ HLA-DR) in BAL cells (A) and PBMC (B) were measured by flow cytometry (++, P 0.01; +++, P 0.001 for DCs) the frequencies (means SEM) of myeloid DCs (mDCs; CD123 CD11c+) and plasmacytoid DCs ( naive B cells differentiate, undergo a proliferative burst, and acquire memory phenotype. in PBMC, the frequency of MZ-like B cells initially decreased at 7 dpi (P 0.001) and then increased to the peak level at 21 dpi (P 0.0001). the frequency (mean SEM) of marginal zone (MZ)-like (IgD+ CD27+), class-switched memory (IgD CD27+), and double-negative (DN; IgD CD27) B cells were measured in BAL (A) and PBMC (D) samples by flow cytometry. the quality and quantity of the immune response to infection (56), vaccination (57), and cancer (58) determined the kinetics and magnitude of lymphocyte proliferation following SVV infection. in BAL cells, B cell proliferation began at 7 dpi, peaked between 10 and 14 dpi, and returned to baseline levels by 17 dpi. 14 dpi (average titer, 1:292,345 50,575; P 0.001) decreased slightly, and remained stable for the duration of the study. naive T cells become activated and differentiate into central memory (CM; CD95+ CD28+ CCR7+), transitional effector memory (TEM; CD95+ CD28+ CCR7) and effector memory (EM; CD28+ CCR7) T cells. in PBMC, a decrease in CD4 CM T cells was accompanied by an increase in TEM cells at 3 and 21 dpi. the frequency of TEM decreased at 7 dpi (P 0.0001) and remained statistically lower than baseline until after 42 dpi (Fig. 5A). a significant proliferative burst in all CD4 and CD8 T cell subsets was detected at 7, 10, and14 dpi (P 0.0001) in all CD4 and CD8 T cell subsets. in PBMC, a significant proliferative burst was detected at 7, 10, and14 dpi (Fig. 5E to H) in PBMC, we observed similar proliferative kinetics in all three CD4 subsets. the frequencies (means SEM) of SVV-specific CD4 (white bar) and CD8 (gray bar) T cells in PBMC samples produced IFN- (A and B), TNF- (C and D), MIP- (E and F) and IL-2 (G and H) were measured by intracellular cytokine staining following stimulation with SVV lysate. SVV-specific CD4 T cells producing IFN- (Fig. 6A), TNF- (Fig. 6C), MIP-1 (Fig. 6E) and IL-2 (Fig. 6G) were first detected at 7 dpi in BAL samples. their frequency peaked at 21 dpi (P 0.0001) in BAL samples. the peak response of SVV-specific CD8 T cells was at 7 dpi for all four cytokines. the peak response of SVV-specific CD8 T cells following stimulation with viral lysate was at 7 dpi for all four cytokines. granzyme B expression in CD8 EM T cells peaked between 3 and 14 dpi. expression of granzyme B in CD8 TEM and EM T cells peaked at 10 dpi. expression of granzyme B in CD4 and CD8 T cells peaked at 10 dpi. SVV infection results in neutrophil and T cell recruitment into the lungs. all RMs displayed hallmarks of SVV varicella. SVV viral loads were measured in whole blood (WB) and bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL) samples by quantitative real-time PCR. the frequencies of CD4 T, CD8 T, and CD20 B cells (means SEM) were determined in BAL samples (D) and PBMC (E) by flow cytometry (#, P 0.05;####, P 0.0001 for CD8 T cells) to characterize the immune response to SVV, we assessed changes in the numbers of two major white blood cell populations. the relative frequency of CD8 T cells increased significantly at 10 dpi, peaked at 17 dpi (P 0.0001) and remained the dominant lymphocyte population in BAL samples until 126 dpi. no significant changes were observed in either the CD4 or CD8 T cell population throughout the study. s, basophils, and T helper type-2 (Th2) lymphocytes (32\u201334) were also significantly increased at 7 dpi (P 0.001) and returned to basal levels by 14 dpi. levels of RANTES (CCL5), important for immune cell recruitment into inflammatory sites (38), increased at 21 dpi (P 0.001) and levels remained significantly increased through 28 dpi (P 0.01) in BAL fluid. IL-15 regulates the activation and proliferation of T cells and NK cells (42), and IL-12, which is important in the differentiation of naive T cells into CD4 helper type 1 T (Th1) cells (43) were significantly induced at 7 dpi (P 0.001) and 14 dpi (P 0.001), respectively. SVV acute infection also led to the upregulation of wound healing and growth factors in the lungs. genesis and acts primarily upon epithelial and endothelial cells (50) were detected at 14 dpi (P 0.001) and 28 dpi (P 0.001). increased level of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which stimulates angiogenesis, was detected at 21 dpi (P 0.001) and 28 dpi (P 0.001) in PBMC, we detected a significant increase in the frequency of pDCs at 7 dpi (P 0.05), followed by a significant increase at 7 dpi (P 0.05), and the frequency returned to baseline by 10 dpi. the frequency of plasmacytoid DCs increases early during acute SVV infection in the lungs. concentration of IFN- was determined by IFN- ELISA in BAL supernatant, mean pg/ml SEM ($$$, P 0.001) pDCs play an important role in antiviral immunity. acute SVV infection elicits B cell proliferation and antibody production in the lungs. the relative frequency of the DN B cell population decreased at 3 dpi (P 0.001) and remained significantly below preinfection levels until 126 dpi. in PBMC, the frequency of MZ-like B cells initially decreased at 7 dpi (P 0.0001) followed by an increase in frequency, peaking at 17 dpi (P 0.01) SVV-specific IgM and IgG antibody endpoint titers (means SEM) were measured by standard ELISA in BAL supernatant (E) and plasma (F) (***, P 0.001 for IgM) proliferation and clonal expansion of antigen-specific lymphocytes are critical for mediating protective immunity. antibodies were detected only at 10 and 14 (average titer, 240 71; P 0.05) dpi. IgG titers were detected at 10 dpi, peaked at 14 dpi. SVV-specific IgG titers in plasma were first detected at 7 dpi, peaked at 14 dpi. the frequencies (means SEM) of central memory (CM; CD95+ CD28+ CCR7+), transitional effector memory (TEM; CD95+ CD28+ CCR7) subsets in CD4 (A, B) and CD8 (C, D) T cells in BAL cells (E, F) and CD8 (G, H) T cells in BAL cells (E, G) and PBMC (F, H) were measured by flow cytometry. CD8 CM T cells in BAL samples showed an increase at 7 dpi (P 0.001) and thereafter remained stable throughout SVV infection (Fig. 5C). in PBMC, we detected an increase in the CD8 EM T cell subset frequency (P 0.01), which was followed by a reciprocal decrease in the frequency of CD8 CM T cells at 3 dpi (P 0.0001), while the TEM subset remained stable (Fig. 5D). CD8 T cell proliferation in PBMC also occurred between 7 and 14 dpi. frequency of SVV-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells is greater than CD8 T cells following acute infection in the lungs. SVV-specific CD4 T cells producing IFN- (A and B), TNF- (C and D), MIP- (E and F) and IL-2 (G and H) were first detected at 7 dpi in BAL samples. frequency of SVV-specific CD4 T cells following stimulation with viral lysate was significantly lower in BAL samples than in PBMC samples. SVV-specific CD8 T cells producing IFN- (Fig. 6B), TNF- (Fig. 6D) and MIP-1 (Fig. 6F) were detected starting at 7 dpi. their frequency peaked at 21 dpi (P 0.0001) in BAL samples. acute SVV infection results in upregulation of granzyme B in CD4 and CD8 T cells in the lungs. no changes were detected in granzyme B expression in CD4 TEM or EM T cells in PBMC. expression of granzyme B differed considerably between CD4 and CD8 T cells. TEM, and EM subsets of CD4 (A and B) and CD8 (C and D) T cells were assessed by flow cytometry in BAL cells (A and C) and PBMC (B and D) (++, P 0.01 for CD4 CM) DISCUSSION Primary infection with varicella-zoster virus (VZV) occurs mainly at the respiratory epithelium (1\u20133) the number of circulating lymphocytes and neutrophils in the blood was significantly but transiently reduced. this suggests potential recruitment of T cells and neutrophils from peripheral blood to the lungs. the increase in monocytes may account for the observed increased levels at 7 dpi of IL-6 and IL-1. IL-15, necessary for CD8 EM differentiation, reached peak levels shortly before a significant increase in frequency of CD8 EM T cells in the lungs. increased BAL levels of IL-12 coincided with increased expression of the cytolytic molecule granzyme B in CD8 and CD4 T cells. increased levels of growth factors can play an important role in repairing tissue damage caused by viral replication. production of IFN- was also shown to be critical in the control of VZV replication in the skin. pDCs can activate both naive and memory T cells (73, 74) and present both endogenous antigens derived from viruses and exogenous antigen to promote the T cell response. laboratory investigating the immune response to influenza virus in rhesus macaques revealed a higher frequency of antigen-specific CD4 T cells than CD8 T cells. this suggests that proliferation precedes and might be required for the acquisition of effector function by T cells. this difference could be due to the nature of stimulation antigens. granzyme B expression in CD4 and CD8 EM T cells reached higher levels. granzyme B induction in CD8 TEM and EM T cells reached higher levels. these observations highlight fundamental differences in the differentiation programs of CD4 and CD8 EM T cells. the second and more gradual decline in viral load to undetectable levels is then mediated by adaptive immunity. adaptive immunity (granzyme B-mediated killing of infected cells, effector cytokine production by T cells and antibodies) is then produced to repair damage that occurred during infection and the ensuing immune response."}
