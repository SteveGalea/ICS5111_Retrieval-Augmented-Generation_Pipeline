{"summary": "simple phenomenological growth models can be useful for estimating transmission parameters and forecasting epidemic trajectories. but most existing phenomenological growth models only support single-peak outbreak dynamics whereas real epidemics often display more complex transmission trajectories. preliminary results using sub-epidemic models can help guide future efforts to better understand the heterogenous spatial and social factors shaping sub-epidemic patterns for other infectious diseases. electronic supplementary material The online version of this article contains supplementary material."}
