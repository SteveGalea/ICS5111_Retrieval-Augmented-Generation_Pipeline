{"summary": "Cryptosporidium was recently found to be a predictor of mortality in toddlers. the correlation between oocyst shedding/detection in feces and diarrheal severity remains unclear. some data suggest a quantitative load of Cryptosporidium may correlate with disease severity. oocysts were treated with 0.6% sodium hypochlorite, washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), quantified using a hemocytometer, and viability determined using a dye permeability assay as previously described. each birth was attended by study personnel, and were performed as clean catch as previously described. immunofluorescence microscopy was performed using the MeriFluor Crypto/Giardia immunofluorescence antibody detection reagent from Meridian Diagnostics. a 0.1 g portion of feces was mixed into 10 mL of PBS and then 100 L of suspension was mixed with 5 L MeriFluor. the obtained count was multiplied by 104 to yield the number of labeled oocysts per gram of fe all qPCR was carried out in the Bio-Rad CFX-96 Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) the primer-probe set used to detect Cryptosporidium is a TaqMan adaptation of those found in Stroup and others, 200619. threshold at or above 35.0 cycles was considered negative. the cryptosporidium Cq value was converted to a genome count. oocyst counts were standardized to the amount of detected PhHV. calves received an oral challenge of 1 105 C. parvum oocysts within the first 24 hours of life. each dose was administered in a 5 mL suspension of oocysts by the rigid portion of an oroesophageal feeding tube, followed by 120 mL of water to ensure all of the oocyst suspension was delivered to the calf. DNA was extracted from calf fecal samples using the Qiagen QIAamp Mini Stool Kit. for each sample 200 mg of feces was lysed using buffer ASL. samples were then heated at 95\u00b0C for 5 minutes before proceeding according to manufacturer's instructions. L reaction contained 12.5 L 2 Bio-Rad iQ Multiplex Mastermix. 0.4 M each of Cryptosporidium F- and R-primers, 0.2 M Cryptosporidium probe, 0.8 M each of PhHV F- and R-primers, and 0.2 M PhHV probe. qPCR detected Cryptosporidium in more samples than did DFA. overall the parasite count enumerated in each sample was higher than the oocyst count enumerated by qPCR. qPCR estimated a mean of 2.4 106 parasites per gram of feces. n/a n/a DFA oocyst count (range) 1 104 \u2013 4 104 n/a DFA = direct fluorescent antibody; qPCR = real-time polymerase chain reaction; IQR = interquartile range. a count of 4.5 104 parasites by microscopy and 2.6 105 parasites by qPCR could optimize the specificities to. 76.9% and 53.9% for microscopy and qPCR, respectively, with little cost to sensitivity. corresponding to positive and negative predictive values of 82% and 71% for microscopy and 71% and 68% for qPCR. this study evaluated and compared direct fluorescent antibody microscopy (DFA) and a laboratory-developed real-time quantitative PCR assay for detection of Cryptosporidium. qPCR detected Cryptosporidium in more samples than did DFA. qPCR parasite count (median) 2.4 106 (IQR = 6.9 105\u20131.1 107) 1.7 105 (IQR = 1.1 105\u20132.4 106) DFA oocyst count (median) 3.7 105 (IQR = 9.3 104\u20138.4 105) n/a qPCR parasite count (median) n/a n/a qPCR parasite count (median) n/a n/ microscopy and qPCR detection yielded sensitivities for diarrhea. a count of 4.5 104 oocysts by microscopy and 2.6 105 parasites by qPCR could optimize the specificities to 76.9% and 53.9% for microscopy and qPCR, respectively. a recent global study found Cryptosporidium to be among the top four most attributable pathogens to severe diarrhea, along with rotavirus, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and Shigella. this also found a high rate of mixed enteropathogen infection, with two or more pathogens detected in 45% of cases. 104 oocysts by microscopy or 2.6 105 parasites by qPCR would predict diarrhea with optimized accuracy. we would not expect perfect sensitivity and specificity because the curves clearly showed increased numbers of oocysts both before and after the symptomatic period. the advantage to the experimental calf system is that timing was controlled and no other confounding pathogens were likely present."}
