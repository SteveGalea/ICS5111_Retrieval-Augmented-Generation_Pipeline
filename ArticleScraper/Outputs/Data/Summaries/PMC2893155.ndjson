{"summary": "study looked at how indoor environmental conditions in the tropics and winter temperate zones contribute to the aerosol spread of influenza by travelers. study compared 632 readings of temperature versus relative humidity (RH) in 389 different enclosed locations air travelers are likely to visit in 8 tropical nations. aerosol studies have shown that micron range droplet particles from breathing, talking, coughing and sneezing bear influenza viruses are less than 1 micron in size. aerosol particles range from 0.1 micron to 5 micron[2,4], and these smallest particles are primary vectors of contagion[5,6]. guinea pigs were exposed to aerosol infection from another guinea pig for 7 days in an environmental cabinet maintaining temperature and relative humidity at varying levels. the risk of aerosol infection of one guinea pig over 7 days of continuous aerosol exposure to an infected guinea pig is roughly 25% (25%G7) a Holmes analog humidity meter was used with a conventional dry bulb thermometer. each reading is a one-time measurement; instruments came to equilibrium before a reading was recorded by hand with the time, date and location. the data could be improved by a more comprehensive data collection conducted in more countries over the course of several years. Contagion estimation contours were drawn from lowen et al. to interpolate contours of transmission of influenza in the humidity versus temperature phase space. emphasized 25% transmission line corresponds to a rough 25% transmission probability in the lowen et al. guinea pig studies. a sample equation formatted for spreadsheet use is supplied in text form. the equation fit is meaningless below 20% RH or above 80% RH. morbidity and mortality data are notoriously difficult to acquire[21,22] a polynomial equation (equation 2, Additional file 1- Contagion contour estimation details) was fitted to the histogram data using maple 10[20] to estimate the risk of start of infection over the days in which secondary infections are estimated to have occurred. to express probability of infection, the histogram values were represented as fractions of the total number of infections. the per passenger risk on a 4 hour luxury bus ride is 0.0123, or 1/81. for every two bus rides of 4 hours under these conditions, approximately 1 aerosol infection would be expected. in 10 minutes in a bank branch at the 25%G7 risk contour, there is a roughly 1 in 1959 chance of infection in any 10 minute period. Moser[34] has a time period of 4.5 hours in an unventilated enclosed aircraft on march 14, 1977 in Homer, Alaska. the outdoor high was 0\u00b0C while the aircraft sat on the runway with the ventilation off. 39 of 54 passengers (72%) were reported ill from an index case. correction applied to the Holmes humidity data based on cross-calibration. each reading is a one-time measurement; instruments came to equilibrium before a reading was recorded by hand with the time, date and location. the data could be improved by a more comprehensive data collection conducted in more countries over the course of several years. emphasized 25% transmission line corresponds to a rough 25% transmission probability in the lowen et al. guinea pig studies. other contours can be referred to with the G7 subscript to clarify what is being discussed. a sample equation formatted for spreadsheet use is supplied in text form. note the equation fit is meaningless below 20% RH or above 80% RH. influenza morbidity and mortality data are notoriously difficult to acquire[21,22] this 4th degree equation from day 1 to 9 was selected to fit observations and knowledge that virus shedding from inoculated animals is expected to end by day 8. to express probability of infection, the histogram values were represented as fractions of the total number of infections. the equation fitted so the area under the curve is equal to 1 to 3 decimal places. in 10 minutes in a bank branch at the 25%G7 risk contour, there is a roughly 1 in 1959 chance of infection in any 10 minute period. for quick, rough estimates in a public health setting, estimates such as these can be made by use of the table. approximately 3 new infections would be expected, or roughly 10% of what was seen. we think it is reasonable to include a multiplier on estimates where air exchange is poor. the contour lines are based on aerosol transmission time course experiments over 7 days. the 25%G7 transmission line indicates that over 7 days under similar controlled conditions 25% of hosts exposed by aerosol would become ill. the distance of points below the chosen transmission line can be visually evaluated by inspection. buses and taxis Luxury buses are used for long-distance trips of 4-12 hours, have air conditioning (AC) and windows operable only in emergency. most readings for new cars in this low risk region are due to higher temperature and low humidity, presumably because automotive engineers. inexpensive buses used by locals have no AC, using open windows for ventilation. readings confirmed that their temperatures and RH are equal to or higher than ambient temperatures. Vendors serving these inexpensive buses were fewer, and were only observed to board briefly at stops, departing the bus within 2-3 minutes. tropical buildings distance (in temperature) from 25%G7 transmission risk contour. 20% or more of the bank branch, office, retail, hotel and dining locations displayed good aerosol transmission conditions with sample size > 20. temperature and RH of terminals (for aircraft and buses), hallways in shopping malls, and hospitals, was considered indicative. the authors believe risk is probably low on a per passenger basis. the period is limited to the short time passengers file out of the airplane and other factors may override T and RH. total estimated vendor time inside buses is on the order of 3-5 hours per day over as many as 20 buses. each bus containing potential influenza aerosol raises their chances of both infection and transmission. they lean in close to many passengers, and have physical contact through money and product exchange. new high end taxis and hotel cars were commonly occupied by travelers for 20-45 minutes. in this figure are shown automobile trips of 5 minutes or more in closed vehicles with air conditioning. it can be seen that within 5 minutes, relative humidity is lowered to between 45% and 25%. in the tropics, on the order of retail and high end hotels, presumably for comfort of patients. datasets with less than 20 measurements are shown with light gray and white to emphasize the difference in sample size. in the temperate Australian winter, 98% of buildings (N = 100) showed good aerosol transmission conditions. low relative humidity (RH) and high RH[5,25,26] with temperature a secondary factor. theory predicts osmotic forces should affect enveloped viruses. icosahedral viruses (e.g. polio, norovirus) would not be so sensitive. Schaffer et al[27] studied stability of enveloped viruses from different cell lines. these cell lines buffer osmotic pressures at different rates. they could cause rupture of virion envelopes as droplets collect distilled water. flu strains may vary in stability from mutations sufficiently to affect the contours of transmission as taken from Lowen. osmotic pressure generates tensile force on the envelope, which will exhibit resistance to osmotic pressure not exceeding the weakest envelope bilayer hydrogen bonds. at 30\u00b0C there is an additional fifth at 20% RH. at 5\u00b0C transmission varies from 100% to 50% and at 20\u00b0C from 100% to 0%. the difference in transmission between 5\u00b0C and 20\u00b0C at 50% and 80% humidity is significant. we strongly encourage performance of larger experiments with multiple strains of influenza and other respiratory viruses. the 25%G7 transmission estimate contour is emphasized and became the reference using the following rationale. we chose conditions that should limit spreading to infect 1 or 2 on average. influenza was communicated well to aircraft passengers during a ground delay in 1979. despite lack of air circulation, filtration of recirculated cabin air on most aircraft today mitigates this hazard. literature raises questions about efficacy of HEPA filters on aircraft[35]. however, careful epidemiology of SARS on an aircraft[24] suggests HEPA filters and air exchange were fairly effective on that aircraft because of the apparent wake pattern of infection. a guess of aerosol expectation based on bus data for comparable outdoor conditions in the current study derived a low of 1 infection (7 hours, 40%G7 risk) and a high of roughly 5 - 6 infections (7 hours, 100%G7 risk, poor ventilation roughly doubling infections) a few aerosol infections out of the 9 could easily be missed by the Han methodology due to overlap. studies have shown viable virus after hours suspended in air[25,27]. tropical temperature and humidity does not block transmission by contact, but does block transmission by aerosol. 25-hD level has been proposed as the seasonal factor for influenza epidemics by correlating 25-hD level inversely with influenza season. the present study presents a view of influenza epidemiology that needs to be carefully considered. osmotic forces should affect enveloped viruses such as influenza, while icosahedral viruses (e.g. polio, norovirus) would not be so sensitive for structural reasons. Schaffer et al[27] studied stability of enveloped viruses from different cell lines. these cell lines buffer osmotic pressures at different rates. they could cause rupture of virion envelopes as droplets collect distilled water from humid air. the current transmission risk contours would remain conservative. however, evolutionary argument supports virus stability in aerosol as strongly conserved. osmotic pressure generates tensile force on the envelope. at 5\u00b0C transmission varies from 100% to 50% and at 20\u00b0C from 100% to 0%. the difference in transmissibility between 5\u00b0C and 20\u00b0C at 50% and 80% humidity is significant (p 0.05). this leaves the 65% relative humidity results at 20\u00b0C to be examined. guinea pig experiments of lowen were performed for 7 days. risk on a bus ride of 8 hours at the 25%G7 contour yields a crude risk of 1/41, which roughly corresponds to 1 new infection per 8 hour bus ride assuming continuous virus shedding. ozone is negligible due to catalytic units. ozone would be expected to deactivate virions significantly[38], but the extent this occurs at ozone levels of aircraft lacking catalytic units is unknown. a major question is the distance at which influenza is transmitted by aerosol. a guess of aerosol expectation based on bus data for comparable outdoor conditions in the current study derived a low of 1 infection (7 hours, 40%G7 risk) and a high of roughly 5 - 6 infections (7 hours, 100%G7 risk, poor ventilation roughly doubling infections) a few aerosol infections out of the 9 could easily be missed by the Han methodology due to overlap. studies have shown viable virus after hours suspended in air[25,27]. tropical temperature and humidity does not block transmission by contact, but does block transmission by aerosol. 25-hD level has been proposed as seasonal factor for influenza epidemics by correlating 25-hD level inversely with influenza season. aircraft infections in Han are left aside for the reasons discussed above. a guess of aerosol expectation based on bus data for comparable outdoor conditions in the current study derived a low of 1 infection (7 hours, 40%G7 risk) and a high of roughly 5 - 6 infections. influenza is transmitted both by contact and by aerosol. the conversion of droplets 5 m to smaller size varies based on humidity. we reiterate Tellier's point that studies have shown viable virus after hours suspended in air. influenza spikes can occur in October and November when 25-hD levels are reported relatively high[45] therefore, 25-hD is a probable influence but whether it is sufficient in itself to explain seasonality is at most an open question. vitamin A (present in cod liver oil with 25-hD for some studies) may also be a significant factor since vitamin A shows a strong influence on measles[46]. superspreaders were important for the SARS epidemic, showing an unexpected distribution of infectors. superspreaders were important for the epidemic, showing an unexpected distribution of infectors. bus companies distributing masks and hand sanitizer to vendors may yield benefits. how to balance that is a question for HVAC engineers. the TB concern indicates that in TB endemic regions humidity lower than 60% should be targeted on the transmission contour map. there are commonalities between other measures that can minimize influenza aerosol contagion and measures against TB and other microbial aerosol. superspreaders were important for the SARS epidemic, showing an unexpected distribution of infectors. superspreaders were important for the SARS epidemic, showing an unexpected distribution of infectors[33] and probably are for influenza. TB is a hardy organism that forms culturable aerosol from coughing[48] but the aerobiology of transmission is not well explored[47] Guinea pig model TB transmission studies in parallel with influenza exploring variations of temperature and RH relative to HEPA filtration and ultraviolet light would be desirable. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors' contributions BB participated in the design of the study. authors read and approved the final manuscript."}
