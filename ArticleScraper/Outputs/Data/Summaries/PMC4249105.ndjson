{"summary": "a single-virus tracking technique in living cells with high temporal and spatial resolutions in real time has recently provided a powerful tool for elucidating the dynamic events occurring during natural and artificial virus-cell interactions. many viruses hijack cellular endocytic pathways of entry, including clathrin-dependent endocytosis, lipid raft/caveola-dependent and non-clathrin-lipid raft/caveola-dependent pathways. canine parvovirus and dengue virus diffuse into nascent and assembled CCPs (8, 11\u201314) caveolae are flask-shaped invaginations of the plasma membrane. disruption of membrane cholesterol severely inhibits lipid raft/caveola endocytosis-mediated virus entry. ase C (PKC), act to promote membrane ruffling by stimulating actin rearrangement (24\u201326) for VACV strain Western Reserve, virus binding to the cell body triggers dramatic and transient membrane blebbing mimicking apoptosis. the virus enters the cell during bleb retraction, and the virus enters the cell during bleb retraction. several viruses move along actin or microtubules using a molecular motor. objects with molecular of masses >500 kDa cannot diffuse freely within the cytoplasm. many viruses transport along microtubules by motor proteins, as observed for influenza virus, human immunodeficiency virus, and adeno-associated virus serotype 2. recent studies on tiger frog virus (TFV) and infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus (ISKNV) demonstrate that both of them enter cells via caveola-dependent endocytosis but not clathrin-mediated endocytosis. SGIV infection induces a highly lethal and serious systemic disease in the grouper industry, often resulting in significant economic losses. GS cells were seeded on coverslips in 6-well plates or cultured in 24-well plates for 18 or 24 h to achieve 75% confluence. SGIV was propagated in GS cells, and virus stocks were maintained at 80\u00b0C. the medium containing SGIV was harvested, followed by three cycles of rapid freezing and thawing. the supernatant was centrifuged at 200,000 g (Beckman 70 Ti rotor) for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. the pellet was resuspended in TN buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5), layered onto a gradient of 30 to 60% (wt/vol) sucrose GS cells were incubated with SGIV for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 h at 28\u00b0C. citrate buffer (40 mM sodium citrate, 10 mM KCl, and 135 mM NaCl, pH 3.1) was added and left for 45 s to inactivate and remove noninternalized viruses. cells were incubated in medium containing Cyto D for 60 min or in medium containing nocodazole for 120 min to disrupt actin filaments or microtubules. image acquisition was performed in the presence of drugs during all experiments. fluorescence microscopy and real-time virus tracking assay. the separated proteins were reacted with anti-VP19 as the primary antibody. the secondary antibody was horseradish peroxidase\u2013goat anti-mouse antibody at a dilution of 1:1,000. Internal control reactions to detect -actin were carried out simultaneously. the SGIV used in this study was originally isolated from diseased grouper (E. tauvina) (50) SGIV was propagated in GS cells, and virus stocks were maintained at 80\u00b0C. the medium was centrifuged at 12,000 g (Eppendorf 5810R centrifuge) for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. the supernatant was centrifuged at 200,000 g (Beckman 70 Ti rotor) for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. the pellet was resuspended in TN buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5) GS cells were incubated with SGIV for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 h at 28\u00b0C. citrate buffer (40 mM sodium citrate, 10 mM KCl, and 135 mM NaCl, pH 3.1) was added and left for 45 s to inactivate and remove noninternalized viruses. cells were examined at 48 h postinfection (hpi) by IFA using anti-VP19 antibody (58 medium containing Cyto D for 60 min or in medium containing nocodazole for 120 min to disrupt actin filaments or microtubules, respectively, prior to infection. fluorescence microscopy and real-time virus tracking assay performed. immunoblots were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system. cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 15 min, and blocked with bovine serum albumin (Sigma) cells were then washed three times with PBS and incubated with primary antibodies against VP19 (1:100). GS cells were infected by Cy5-labeled SGIV (red) and immobilized at 0 min (C), 30 min (D), 60 min (E) and 120 min (F) after infection. the infection rate was calculated by IFA at 36 hpi. the number of virus particles remained similar between 1.5 and 6 hpi. we recorded and analyzed the actions of single Cy5-labeled SGIV particles. SGIV transports along filopodia-like protrusions and then enters into the cell. CPZ and sucrose can induce clathrin lattices to assemble on endosomal membranes. hypertonic sucrose can disturb the formation of CCVs on the cell membrane. SGIV VP19 was an envelope protein that could be specifically recognized by antibody against VP19 during SGIV infection. cells were pretreated with different amounts of CPZ for 120 min. infected cells were then analyzed at 48 hpi by IFA. SGIV infectivity and viral protein synthesis impaired by CPZ (C), sucrose (D) and dynasore (E) dynamin-dependent and clathrin-mediated endocytosis is involved in SGIV entry. entry of SGIV is independent of lipid raft/caveolin. nystatin is a sterol-binding drug. cell entry of SGIV is independent of lipid raft/caveolin-dependent endocytosis. GS cells were pretreated with different concentrations of MCD or nystatin. nystatin and nystatin have no influence on SGIV infectivity or viral protein synthesis. we used the Na+/H+ exchanger inhibitor EIPA to clarify the role of macropinocytosis in SGIV entry. treatment with 40 M EIPA reduced the uptake of fluorescently labeled SGIV particles in the cytoplasm. SGIV entry depended on the Na+/H+ exchanger (Fig. 5A and C) infectivity was examined by IFA (n = 3; mean SD), and levels of SGIV viral protein and -actin were analyzed by Western blotting. GS cells were infected with SGIV for 30 min, incubated with dextran for 25 min, and analyzed by CLSM. rottlerin and IPA-3 significantly decreased the percentage of SGIV infection. SGIV enters cells via macropinocytosis pathway. ML-7 (A), NSC23766 (B), rottlerin (C) and IPA-3 (D) reduced SGIV infectivity and viral protein synthesis. GS cells were pretreated with various concentrations of drugs for 120 min. then incubated with SGIV for 120 min. GS cells were pretreated with various concentrations of Baf A1 (A) and CQ (B) for 120 min. after being washed with citrate buffer to remove noninternalized viruses, the cells were collected at 48 hpi. SGIV enters host cells in a pH-dependent manner. viruses are usually delivered to endosomal compartments and transported to the nucleus along actin filaments/microtubules. pEGFP-tub was transfected into GS cells to indicate microtubules. GS cells were infected with Cy5-labeled SGIV (red) at 28\u00b0C for 30 min, fixed, and stained for actin using Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin (green) for 30 min. SGIV is located in dot-like actin filaments during the early stage of SGIV infection. SGIV particles were mostly confined to a limited area with a speed of 0.4 m/s after treatment with nocodazole. the percentages of trajectories with a peak speed of >0.05 m/s were 30.4% in untreated cells, 10.6% in nocodazole-treated cells, and 12.8% in Cyto D-treated cells. GS cells were pretreated with 4 M nocodazole for 2 h before infection with SGIV. arrow in panel B indicates movement in a limited area. arrowhead indicates directed movement covering areas of several square micrometers. more than 300 trajectories were analyzed. MSD analysis of SGIV particles in untreated (blue line), nocodazole-treated (red bars), and Cyto D-treated (green bars) cells. GS cells were infected by SGIV (red) and immobilized at 0 min (C), 30 min (D), 60 min (E) and 120 min (F) after infection. just before imaging, GS cells were incubated with DiO to show the cell boundaries (green) successive z-stacks spaced by 200 nm were recorded to construct the 3D images. 5-labeled SGIV particles traveled along filopodia-like protrusions to reach the surface of the cell body and then moved from the cell membrane toward the intracellular environment. however, individual SGIV particles attached to the protrusion arrived at the cell surface as the protrusion retracted. IV particles entering cells treated with 20 M CPZ compared with mock-treated cells. we also assessed the percentage of SGIV-infected cells under treatment with different drugs using IFA. CPZ greatly inhibited viral protein synthesis compared with that for untreated controls. GS cells were pretreated with different drugs for 120 min. they were then infected with SGIV for 120 min. infection rate was measured as percentage of treated cells with incorporated viruses. GS cells were transfected with pEGFP-LCa to indicate clathrin. after SGIV infection, some virus particles colocalized with clathrin clusters. together, these results establish that dynamin-dependent and clathrin-mediated endocytosis is involved in SGIV entry. GS cells were pretreated with different concentrations of MCD or nystatin. followed by infection with Cy5-labeled SGIV (red) for 120 min. more than 100 cells were examined by CLSM. 40 M EIPA reduced the uptake of fluorescently labeled SGIV particles in the cytoplasm. the percentage of SGIV-infected cells was significantly reduced in the presence of 20 M or 40 M EIPA, compared with mock-treated cells (P 0.05), suggesting that SGIV entry depended on the Na+/H+ exchanger. increasing numbers of studies have reported signaling events during macropinocytic mechanism of endocytosis. Activation of PAK1, the small GTPase Rac1, and a functional actomyosin network was shown to be essential for macropinocytosis during influenza virus entry (64), while EV1 and VACV entry via macropinocytosis depended on PAK1 and PKC (65, 66). s of drugs for 120 min and then incubated with SGIV for 120 min. after being washed with citrate buffer to remove noninternalized viruses, the cells were collected at 48 hpi. level of viral protein expression was detected by Western blotting. SGIV particles are delivered to endocytic compartments during entry. GS cells were infected with pEGFP-Rab5 and pEGFP-Rab7. SGIV particles were observed with Rab5 and Rab7 at 30 and 60 min postinfection. pEGFP-tub was transfected into GS cells to indicate microtubules. pEGFP-tub was transfected into GS cells to indicate microtubules. pEGFP-tub was transfected into GS cells to indicate microtubules. arrows show many virus particles (red) colocalized with actin filaments. SGIV is located in dot-like actin filaments. GS cells were infected with pEGFP-tub (green) prior to infection. SGIV particles were mostly confined to a limited area with a speed of 0.4 m/s after treatment with Cyto D. the percentages of SGIV trajectories with a peak speed of >0.05 m/s were 30.4% in untreated cells, 10.6% in nocodazole-treated cells and 12.8% in Cyto D-treated cells. ous speeds as a function of time (C) are also shown. arrow in panel B indicates movement in a limited area. arrowhead indicates directed movement covering areas of several square micrometers. e bars are 10 m (A, B, D, and E) and 5 m (G and H) DISCUSSION Viruses have evolved to exploit endocytosis as an effective means of entering host cells. knowledge of virus entry pathways is therefore important for understanding viral pathogenesis and developing effective drugs to block virus infection before entry. ocytosis, including HIV (83), hepatitis C virus (84), hepatitis C virus (84), hepatitis C virus (84), bovine ephemeral fever virus (85), rabies virus (86), and astrovirus (87). clathrin-mediated SGIV entry was relatively fast, compared with caveola-mediated endocytic entry of TFV. caveola-mediated endocytosis is sensitive to cholesterol-depleting reagents. some viruses enter cells via caveola-dependent, clathrin-independent endocytosis. some viruses enter cells via caveola-dependent endocytosis. macropinocytosis has been shown to be involved in the entry of many mammalian viruses, including EV1 (65), respiratory syncytial virus (103), filamentous influenza virus (104), EBOV (105), ASFV (19), VACV (66), and human cytomegalovirus (106). SGIV infection induced the uptake of dextran, which is known marker of macropinocytosis/fluid-phase uptake. inhibition of PAK1 activity by IPA-3 or inhibition of Rac1 activity by NSC23766 significantly inhibited SGIV entry. inhibition of myosin II activity by ML-7 or inhibition of PKC activity by rottlerin also inhibited SGIV entry. adenovirus serotype 5 and HCV can move along actin filaments or microtubules at speeds of around 0.2 to 5.0 m/s. the highest instantaneous velocity of SGIV particles measured was 0.9 m/s, similar to that of infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (113). bluetongue virus (BTV) can infect a wide variety of cell types in its mammalian host. BTV-10 entry into vero and HeLa cells occurs via clathrin-mediated endocytosis. BTV-1 infection of BHK cells occurs via a clathrin-independent macropinocytosis-like entry mechanism. further studies are needed to determine the detailed mechanisms involved in the entry routes that iridoviruses use."}
