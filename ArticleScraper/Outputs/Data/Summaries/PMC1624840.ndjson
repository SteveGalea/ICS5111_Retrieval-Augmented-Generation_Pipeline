{"summary": "98 index patients were available for analysis (22 with transmission, 76 with no transmission) only three factors were significant: delay to isolation, admission to a non-isolation facility and higher lactate dehydrogenase levels. the first emerging infectious disease of the new century with epidemic potential. study analysed epidemiological and clinical data on probable SARS patients admitted to Tan Tock Seng Hospital. it included all index patients causing secondary infections within (TTSH) and all individuals exposed in TTSH who contracted SARS in the course of follow-up surveillance. index patients within TTSH were identified from outbreak investigations by on-site epidemiologists. the hospital contact tracing team was updated on individuals exposed in TTSH who were confirmed to be infected. the team then collated epidemiological information on dates of onset, admission and isolation for these index patients. index patients who caused at least one secondary infection were analysed as \"cases\" all index patients who did not cause any secondary infections were analysed as \"controls\" exposure variables included demographic, epidemiological and clinical features associated with individual index patients. 106 individuals satisfied inclusion criteria of being part of the chain of transmission within TTSH. 22 index patients who transmitted the disease were analysed as \"cases\" in all, 22 index patients who transmitted the disease were analysed as \"cases\" in all, 58% were infected in the course of their duty as healthcare. 10% were infected while admitted as inpatients of TTSH for unrelated medical conditions. 90% eventually developed radiographic abnormalities. positive confirmatory tests for SARS-CoV infection were available for 93% of the study patients. index patients originally infected as inpatients were more likely to transmit the disease. the need for oxygen, shortness of breath, vomiting, and higher lactate dehydrogenase levels were all more frequent in index patients. n % n % OR 95%CI p-value Demographics Age - = 24 4 18.2% 19 25.0% 1.00 (Ref) - 25 to 49 12 54.5% 49 64.5% 1.16 (0.33\u20134.06) 0.812 - 50 and above 6 27.3% 8 10.5% 3.56 (0.79\u201316.14) 0.099 Female gender (vs male) 19 86.4% 60 78.9% 1.69 (0.44\u20136.43) 0.4 38 Disease severity at time of isolation - had an abnormal chest radiograph 15 68.2% 63 82.9% 0.44 (0.15\u20131.3) 0.138 - required oxygen therapy 7 31.8% 7 9.2% 4.60 (1.4\u201315.08) 0.012 - admitted to ICU or HD 4 18.2% 0 0.0% NC - intubated 2 9.1% 0 0.0% NC Signs and symptoms at time of isolation - temperature > = 38oC 16 72.7% 58 76 the strongest predictor of transmission was admission to a non-isolation ward, followed by delay in isolation, and having a lactate dehydrogenase value >650IU/L. no significant interactions were identified between these three covariates. 4% 0.565 3.39 3 Admitted non-isolation only Nil 18.4% 0.504 - - Delayed isolation only 19 37.8% 0.215 4.09 5 Lactate dehydrogenase >650 IU/L only 8 45.9% 0.168 1.34 2 No risk factors 53 100.0% 0.041 2.17 1 ln ( p i 1 p i ) = 3.15 + 1.86 x 1 i + 3.17 x 2 i the strongest predictor for transmission has occurred is admission to a non-isolation ward. this has previously been suspected based on outbreak descriptions from healthcare settings. similar observations of nosocomial transmission arising from unsuspected, non-isolated cases have been made across different countries and different hospital settings. shen and colleagues found an association between disease severity in the index patient and disease transmission. the link may lie in the number of susceptible contacts exposed to such severely ill patients, and follow-up studies are in progress to verify this hypothesis. close to 7 out of every 10 infected contacts were healthcare workers and household members. close to 7 out of every 10 infected contacts were healthcare workers and household members. however, close to 7 out of every 10 infected contacts were healthcare workers and household members. the key weakness of our study is whether some of the index patients analysed as \"controls\" actually caused undetected transmission. study may have lacked power to identify some important risk factors. small number of events also contributed to wide confidence intervals for some of the odds ratios. unmeasured confounders could have affected the results of the study. the final model presented in this study does explain to a large extent the variability in transmission that was observed during the outbreak. in any future outbreak of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, such analyses may well allow index patients with higher transmission probability to be identified. the contact tracing team from Tan Tock Seng Hospital worked around the clock during the outbreak to support outbreak management. no specific funding was required for this study and the authors were under the routine employment of their respective institutions."}
