{"summary": "a mucosal vaccine based in recombinant lactic acid bacteria breaks the immunological tolerance of the gut in order to elicit a protective immune response. lipid modification of OspA targets the protein to the cell envelope of L. plantarum, and it is responsible for protein export across the membrane. we have recently developed an oral vaccine based in L. plantarum expressing the outer surface protein A (OspA), a lipoprotein from Borrelia burgdorferi [12]. evidence suggests that the peptidoglycan layer of some LAB promote natural immuno-adjuvanticity [13], [14], [15], [16] and antigen localization on the cell wall makes it more accessible to the immune system. the procedures involving human blood were approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) all participants provided written informed consent. the procedures were in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act and the Public Health Service Policy on humane care and use of laboratory animals. recombinant L. plantarum cells were disrupted with a french\u00ae press. supernatants were electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. the insoluble material was separated from the cytosol fraction by centrifugation. detergent and aqueous phases were washed three times. each phase was analyzed on 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. pET9c-mutOspA mutant was previously described. aliquots of 1 ml were treated with 250 KU/ml of lysozyme (Lyz; Novagen, Gibbstown, NJ) for 45 min at 37\u00b0C. supernatants were ultracentrifugated for 1 h to separate membranes from cytosol fraction. l were placed on slides and air-dried at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. slides were washed three times with TGF buffer and fixed with 4% PBS\u2013buffered formaldehyde. cells were mounted in VectaShield medium containing 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. labeled cells were incubated with pNPP Microwell Substrate System (KPL) microtiter plates were loaded with 100 l of each cellular suspension. optical densities were measured at 405 nm by a Spectra MAX plus ELISA reader. monocytes were purified from PBMC using the monocyte Isolation Kit II. these monocytes were then used to produce monocyte derived dendric cells. cells were placed at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator. intragastric inoculation of recombinant L. plantarum expressing target antigen was cultured in LM medium supplemented with 10 g/ml Cm. cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C and resuspended in 20% glycerol/phosphate buffered salt solution. cells were frozen quickly in a dry ice bath and stored at 80\u00b0C. the animals were housed in a pathogen free colony on hardwood chip bedding in microisolator cages at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN. they were kept on a 12 h light-dark cycle, in a room kept al 23\u00b0C with 50\u201360% relative humidity. human colonic carcinoma epithelial cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 in DMEM-F12K medium modified by ATCC. expression vectors were then transformed into L. plantarum strain 256 to obtain the clones LpA and LpAD17. supernatants were analyzed on 12% denaturing polyacrilamide gels. electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PVDF, Millipore, Billerica, MA) for analysis with an OspA-specific monoclonal antibody. the protein bands corresponding to each OspA antigen were quantified by densitometry using a Multi ImageTM Light Cabinet and the AlphaEaseTM software. the results were plotted as a percentage of the total OspA content for each recombinant Lactobacillus. a vector that expresses the full-length ospA gene from B. burgdorferi in Escherichia coli was previously described. supernatants were ultracentrifugated for 1 h to separate membranes from cytosol fractions. three (3) g of each fraction was analyzed on 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. cells were washed and resuspended in TGF buffer with mAb LA2.2. cells were washed twice with TG buffer, resuspended in the same buffer supplemented with 3% BSA (Bovine Serum Albumin, Sigma) and incubated with mAb LA2.2 (1500). cells were incubated with pNPP Microwell Substrate System (KPL) microtiter plates were loaded with 100 l of each cellular suspension. T84 cells were co-cultured with UV-killed recombinant L. plantarum at a MOI 101 bacteria per cell, for 48 h. the lack of cell viability was confirmed by culture in MRS agar. cultures were placed at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator. every two days the medium was removed and 2 ml of fresh complete medium was added. cells were co-cultured with 2.5 g/ml of purified recombinant OspA. groups of four female C3H-HeJ mice were immunized by intragastric inoculation of 41010 Lactobacillus expressing OspA recombinant antigens. mice received the first immunization twice daily, twice daily, for 8 days (days 1\u20134 and 8\u201311) after resting for two weeks the mice were bled. anti-mouse IgG, anti-mouse IgG1, anti-mouse IgG2a or anti-mouse IgA horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (12,000) were used as secondary antibody. p0.05 are considered statistically significant. the single band seen for LpAD17 (30.4 kDa) may represent the unlipidated OspA (containing the leader peptide) ospA and ospAD17 constructs (A), and immunoblot characterization (B). Whole-cell extract of control, OspA- and OspAD17-expressing L. plantarum (Lp, LpA, and LpAD17, respectively) were analyzed on a 12% SDS-P pA should be protein that is associated with the cell envelope via the lipid anchor, or the lipidated form of OspA. differences for the mutant OspAD17 partitions are statistically significant. L. plantarum is exported through the membrane and accumulates in the cell wall. unlipidated OspAD17 remains mostly attached to the membrane. a 5 min digestion with Lyz exposes a high amount of OspA that is associated with the cell wall. unlipidated OspAD17 (LpAD17) is trapped within the peptidoglycan layer. that is, a 5 min digestion with Lyz exposes a low amount of OspA. a 45 min or 30 min digestion exposes a high amount of OspA that is associated with the peptidoglycan layer. cells were incubated with mAb LA2.2 and anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody labeled with alkaline phosphatase. the cells were then subjected to lcELISA using mAb LA2.2 and anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody labeled with alkaline phosphatase. OspA (LpA) or the mutant OspAD17 (LpAD17) were co-cultured with T84 cells at MOI 10:1 colony-forming units per cell for 48 h. 0.5 g/ml TNF and UV-killed L. plantarum (Lp) were used as positive and negative control. mutOspA showed a 10 fold-decrease in the TNF production. mutOspA did not induce neither IL-12 nor IFN cytokine production. differences between wtOspA and mutOspA are statistically significant. UV-killed recombinant L. plantarum expressing either lipidated OspA (LpA), the mutant unlipidated OspA (LpAD17) or the control (Lp) the amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF, IL-12, IFN and IL-6 was quantified by ELISA. 106 cells/well were seeded in 24 well plates and co-cultured with recombinant Lactobacillus expressing OspA (LpA) or the mutant OspAD17 (LpAD17) at MOI 10:1 colony-forming units per cell. cytokine production was measured by sandwich ELISA (Quantikine) lipidated (LpA) and the mutant appeared to impair this response. differences between LpA and LpAD17 are statistically significant. mucosal OspA-specifc IgA in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and stool suspensions (Stool) were measured by indirect ELISA. mice inoculated with LpA produced higher levels of OspA-specific IgG1 compared to mice inoculated with LpAD17. the average of triplicate samples per mouse was determined. n = 4 mice per group. ns, not significant. the two bands seen for LpA may represent the lipidated unprocessed OspA protein (the leader peptide has not been cleaved, 31 kDa) and the lipidated mature protein (the leader peptide has been cleaved, 30 kDa) spA (70%) than hydrophobic (25%). if about 25% of OspA is associated with the cell envelope due to hydrophobicity of the leader sequence, then the difference should be protein that is associated with the cell envelope via the lipid anchor. lcELISA and immunofluorescence assays incubated the recombinant L. plantarum with Lyz for 5 and 45 min. the cells were washed and incubated with mAb LA2.2. reactions without lyz (No Lyz) detect protein that is exposed on the surface of the cell. lipidated OspA (LpA) is trapped within the cell wall. a 5 min digestion with Lyz exposes a high amount of OspA that is associated with the peptidoglycan layer. a 45 min or 30 min digestion exposes a lower amount of OspA that is associated with the membrane. 3 g of each fraction was analyzed in a 12% SDS-PAGE. cells were incubated with mAb LA2.2 and anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody labeled with alkaline phosphatase. cellular immune response to recombinant L. plantarum was determined. human epithelial cells (T84) were seeded in 24-well plates (106 cells/well) and grown until they reached about 95% confluence. 0.5 g/ml TNF and UV-killed L. plantarum (Lp) were used as positive and negative control. kines TNF, IL-12, IFN, and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were quantified by ELISA. wtOspA mutant lacking the leader peptide, mutOspA, showed a 10 fold-decrease in the TNF production. mutOspA did not induce neither IL-12 nor IFN cytokine production. the amount of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF, IL-12, IFN and IL-6, and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was quantified by ELISA. compared to the control, LpA induced significantly less TNF, IL-12, IFN, IL-6 and IL-10 (p0.001). 106 cells/well were seeded in 24 well plates and co-cultured with recombinant Lactobacillus expressing OspA (LpA) or the mutant OspAD17 (LpAD17) at MOI 10:1 colony-forming units per cell. after 48 h of stimulation, supernatants were collected and analyzed cytokine production. mutant L. plantarum expressing the unlipidated OspA (LpAD17) abrogated this response as seen by the decreased production of TNF, IL-12 and IL-6. IL-10 was 2\u20133 fold upregulated after stimulation with recombinant lipidated (LpA) antibody response to oral administration of recombinant L. plantarum. we immunized mice and tested serum levels of OspA-specific total IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies. mice inoculated with either LpA or LpAD17 developed equivalent levels of IgG2a. control mice were inoculated with L. plantarum (Lp) or the mutant OspAD17 (LpAD17) specific serological anti-OspA total IgG (A), IgG1 (B) and IgG2a (C) antibodies were measured by indirect ELISA. results are representative of one of three independent experiments. recombinant L. plantarum expressing B. burgdorferi OspA lipoprotein induced the production of OspA-specific IgA and IgG antibodies as a result of oral administration. recombinant L. plantarum expressing OspA lipoprotein targets the protein to the cell envelope of the delivery vehicle, L. plantarum. the mutant appears to be unlipidated and localizes mostly at membrane-cell wall interface. it is consistent with a previous study of Gram-positive lactococcus spp. lipoprotein processing. the intestinal immune system is the largest and most complex part of the immune system [23] recombinant OspA-expressing-L. plantarum stimulates immune response via Th1/Th2 cell mediated immunity. pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF, IFN and IL-12 were markedly upregulated. wtOspA (wtOspA) induced TNF and IL-10 but it did not induce IL-12 or IFN. mutation of the Cys17 on the leader peptide of OspA decreases the production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. the lipidation of OspA has a clear role on the mixed Th1/Th2 cellular and humoral immune response to orally administered Lactobacillus expressing OspA. we investigated the mechanism by which a mucosal vaccine based in recombinant LAB breaks the immunological tolerance of the gut."}
