{"summary": "porcine epidemic diarrhea coronavirus (PEDV)4 has swept across the u.s. since 2013, causing an 80\u2013100% fatality rate in piglets and wiping out more than 10% of the pig population in less than a year (1\u20133) there is no effective strategy available to keep the spread in check. extracellular trypsin-like proteases in pig intestines are essential for cell entry of PEDV (14\u201316) however, these cell culture studies used live PEDV particles for cell entry and did not differentiate PEDV entry from other steps of the PEDV infection cycle. PEDV spike contained a C-terminal C9 tag and could be detected using an anti-C9 tag monoclonal antibody. as a positive control, MERS-CoV spike, which contained a C-terminal C9 tag, had been cleaved on the pseudovirus surface. treatment was taken as 100%. a proprotein convertase inhibitor, Dec-RVKR-CMK, did not affect PEDV pseudovirus entry into Huh-7 cells. proprotein convertases from virus-targeted cells do not proteolytically activate PEDV entry. the enhanced MERS-CoV pseudovirus entry in Huh-7 cells exogenously expressing TMPRSS2 could be reversed by camostat. the results were consistent with previous observations that MERS-CoV entry could be activated by TMPRSS2. as a control, only bafilomycin A1, but not E-64d, significantly reduced VSV pseudovirus entry into Huh-7 and PK-15 cells. results consistent with previous reports that VSV entry into host cells depends on endocytosis but not lysosomal cysteine proteases. lysosomal cysteine proteases play a critical role in PEDV entry. PEDV pseudovirus entry in the presence of inhibitors that are specific for cathepsin L or cathepsin B (i.e. CA-074 Me) both inhibitors dramatically reduced PEDV pseudovirus entry into Huh-7 and PK-15 cells. expressed PEDV spike with recombinant cathepsin L and cathepsin B at pH 5.6. at relatively low concentrations, cathepsin L further cleaved PEDV spike to S2. lysosomal cysteine proteases process PEDV spike and activate PEDV entry. lysosomal cysteine proteases activate PEDV entry into porcine small intestine cells. lysosomal cysteine proteases activate PEDV pseudovirus entry into porcine small intestine cells. lysosomal cysteine proteases activate PEDV pseudovirus entry into porcine small intestine cells. extracellular trypsin can process PEDV spike when lysosomal cysteine proteases are inhibited or unavailable. however, when available, lysosomal cysteine proteases play a major role in PEDV entry into host cells. vero CCL81 cells were pretreated with one of the lysosomal cysteine protease inhibitors (E64d, cathepsin L, or cathepsin B) before they were infected by live PEDV. cells were chemically fixed and incubated with FITC-labeled mouse anti-PEDV N protein antibody. retroviruses pseudotyped with PEDV spike (i.e. PEDV pseudoviruses) were produced in HEK293T cells. then subjected to Western blotting analysis using antibody against its C-terminal C9 tag. a TMPRSS2 inhibitor, camostat, had no impact on PEDV pseudovirus entry into Huh-7 cells exogenously expressing or not expressing TMPRSS2. this results suggest that TMPRSS2 does not activate PEDV entry into host cells. TMPRSS2 in the pCAGGS vector were preincubated with camostat (a cell surface serine proteases inhibitor) at the indicated concentrations and transduced by PEDV pseudoviruses (A) or MERS-CoV pseudoviruses (B). the pseudovirus entry in empty pCAGGS cells without any inhibitor treatment was taken as 100%. retroviruses pseudotyped with VSV envelop glycoprotein (i.e. VSV pseudoviruses) were used as a control. the pseudovirus entry in target cells without any inhibitor treatment was taken as 100%. target cells, unbound pseudovirus particles removed, and bound pseudovirus particles treated with 40 g/ml exogenous trypsin. PEDV pseudovirus entry in the absence of inhibitor or exogenous trypsin was taken as 100% in each cell line. cathepsin B cleaved PEDV spike to S2 but failed to further cleave PEDV S2. host lysosomal cysteine proteases process PEDV spike and activate PEDV entry. porcine small intestine is the major target organ for PEDV infections. pcDNA vector-packaged pseudoviruses (Mock) were used as a negative control. the pseudovirus entry mediated by PEDV spike was taken as 100%. previous studies showed that exogenous trypsin could activate the entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome and MERS-CoV into host cells. pcDNA vector-packaged pseudoviruses were used as a negative control. the pseudovirus entry mediated by PEDV spike in the absence of exogenous trypsin was taken as 100%. lysosomal cysteine proteases activate live PEDV entry into host cells. retroviruses pseudotyped with PEDV spike (i.e. PEDV pseudoviruses) were packaged in HEK293T cells. we performed Western blotting analysis to detect the cleavage state of PEDV spike. PEDV spike contained a C-terminal C9 tag and could be detected using an anti-C9 tag monoclonal antibody. the pseudovirus entry efficiency was characterized as luciferase activity accompanying the entry. a proprotein convertase inhibitor, Dec-RVKR-CMK, did not affect PEDV pseudovirus entry into Huh-7 cells. as a positive control, MERS-CoV pseudovirus entry in Huh-7 cells exogenously expressing TMPRSS2 could be reversed by camostat. this results were consistent with previous observations that MERS-CoV entry could be activated by TMPRSS2. both inhibitors significantly reduced PEDV pseudovirus entry into host cells. lysosomal cysteine proteases play a critical role in PEDV entry. lysosomal cysteine proteases activate PEDV pseudovirus entry. cathepsin L and cathepsin B activate PEDV pseudovirus entry. both inhibitors dramatically reduced PEDV pseudovirus entry into Huh-7 and PK-15 cells. cathepsin L and cathepsin B cleave PEDV spike in HEK293T cells. we treated the cell-expressed PEDV spike with recombinant cathepsin L and cathepsin B. at relatively low concentrations, cathepsin L further cleaved PEDV spike to S2. lysosomal cysteine proteases activate PEDV pseudovirus entry into porcine small intestine cells. lysosomal cysteine proteases activate PEDV pseudovirus entry into porcine small intestine cells. extracellular protease trypsin can process PEDV spike when lysosomal cysteine proteases are inhibited or unavailable. lysosomal cysteine proteases play a major role in PEDV entry into host cells. lysosomal cysteine proteases activate live PEDV entry into host cells. cells were pretreated with one of the lysosomal cysteine protease inhibitors (E64d, cathepsin L, or cathepsin B) before they were infected. retroviruses pseudotyped with PEDV spike (i.e. PEDV pseudoviruses) were produced in HEK293T cells and then subjected to Western blotting analysis using antibody against its C-terminal C9 tag. retroviruses pseudotyped with PEDV spike were produced in HEK293T cells. the role of cell surface proteases in PEDV Pseudovirus Entry Next we investigated whether cell surface proteases activate PEDV entry. previous studies demonstrated that Huh-7 cells do not express the cell surface serine protease TMPRSS2 (19, 20), indicating that PEDV entry does not require activation by TMPRSS2. lysosomal cysteine proteases do not activate PEDV pseudovirus entry. lysosomal cysteine proteases play a critical role in PEDV entry. lysosomal cysteine proteases cleave PEDV spike and activate PEDV entry. a and B, Huh-7 cells (A) or PK-15 cells (B) were preincubated with 50 m cathepsin. unbound pseudovirus particles were removed and bound pseudovirus particles were either treated or not with 40 g/ml exogenous trypsin. PEDV pseudovirus entry in the absence of inhibitor was taken as 100% in each cell line. cathepsin B cleaved PEDV spike to S2 but failed to further cleave PEDV S2. host lysosomal cysteine proteases process PEDV spike and activate PEDV entry. porcine small intestine is the major target organ for PEDV infections. pcDNA vector-packaged pseudoviruses were used as a negative control. the pseudovirus entry mediated by PEDV spike in the absence of any inhibitor was taken as 100%. previous studies showed that exogenous trypsin could activate the entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome and MERS-CoV into host cells. -15 cells (B), unbound PEDV pseudovirus particles were removed. bound PEDV pseudovirus particles were either treated or not with exogenous trypsin. lysosomal cysteine proteases play critical roles in PEDV entry into host cells. previous studies identified extracellular protease trypsin as required for PEDV entry in cell culture. however, these previous studies all used live PEDV virus particles. this led to the conclusion that intestinal proteases are essential for PEDV entry (14\u201316) the role of trypsin in other steps of the PEDV infection cycle remains to be investigated. our study suggests that cysteine protease inhibitors alone may not be sufficient to block PEDV entry because trypsin can have a backup role in activating PEDV entry. instead, combinational use of cysteine protease inhibitors and trypsin inhibitors may be more effective to block PEDV entry. the genes of cathepsin L (GenBank accession no.
