{"summary": "there have been 877 laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infections to date. all cases directly or indirectly linked to the Middle East region. recent announcements of laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV have exacerbated concerns regarding the global evolution of this epidemic. human-to-human transmission has been reported in several case clusters. there is currently no evidence for sustained community transmission (11) MERS-CoV infections have been associated with severe lower respiratory tract infections. a global transcriptome analysis of host responses to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV suggested that MERS-CoV modulated transcriptional changes in the host differently from the way in which SARS-CoV did. however, viral replication kinetics were similar for both viruses (20) analysis of our kinome data suggested that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/serine-threonine kinase (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling responses were specifically modulated in response to MERS-CoV infection. HCoV-EMC/2012 (MERS-CoV) was used for all experiments. kinase inhibitors were reconstituted according to manufacturers' recommendations in either water or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) MERS-CoV-infected and mock-infected cells and cell culture supernatant were harvested at identified time points (1, 6, and 24 h postinfection [p.i.] for subsequent kinome analysis. peptide arrays were based upon a previously reported protocol (29) the kinome arrays were incubated for 2 h at 37\u00b0C as described previously (22) the peptide arrays were then washed once with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, followed by a single wash in deionized H2O. the peptide arrays were submerged in PRO-Q Diamond phosphoprotein stain (Invitrogen) with gentle agitation in the dark for 1 h. overrepresentation analysis of differentially phosphorylated proteins was performed using innateDB software. pathways are assigned a probability (P) value on the basis of the number of genes present for a particular pathway as well as the degree to which they are differentially expressed or modified relative to their expression. -HCl, pH 6.8, 8% SDS, 40% glycerol, 4% -mercaptoethanol, 50 mM EDTA) supernatants were removed from biocontainment and boiled again for 20 min at 95\u00b0C. kinase inhibitor cytotoxicity was determined using the Cytotox colorimetric assay. the final concentration of DMSO was 0.1% for all experimental conditions. cells were infected with MERS-CoV at an MOI of 0.05 for 1 h at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 with periodic rocking. after 48 h, the cells were fixed with 10% neutral buffered formalin. Huh7 cells were plated in 6-well plates in fresh DMEM supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) in a 37\u00b0C humidified incubator with 5% (vol/vol) CO2. MERS-CoV isolate HCoV-EMC/2012 (MERS-CoV) was used for all experiments. 0.05 for 1 h at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 with periodic rocking. cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove unbound virus, replenished with fresh DMEM supplemented with 2% (vol/vol) FBS. kinome arrays were incubated for 2 h at 37\u00b0C as described previously. the peptide arrays were subsequently washed once with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, followed by a single wash in deionized H2O. a final wash was performed with deionized H2O. pathway overrepresentation analysis was performed using PIIKA software. pathways are assigned a probability (P) value on the basis of the number of genes present for a particular pathway as well as the degree to which they are differentially expressed. Huh7 cells were harvested at 1, 6, or 24 h p.i., lysed in SDS loading buffer without bromophenol blue (200 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 8% SDS, 40% glycerol, 4% -mercaptoethanol, 50 mM EDTA) and boiled for 20 min at 95\u00b0C. protein concentration was determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) Huh7 cells were plated in black, opaque-bottom 96-well plates. cells were pretreated for either 1 h prior to infection or 2 h postinfection with kinase inhibitors at final concentrations of 0.1, 1 and 10 M. cells were fixed with 10% neutral buffered formalin for 30 min. cell supernatants from the infected and mock-infected cells were harvested 48 h p.i. and the inhibitory activity of the kinase inhibitor-treated cells was assessed by plaque reduction assay. RESULTS Temporal kinome analysis of MERS-CoV-infected hepatocytes. a sample harvested at 1 h p.i. clustered between the mock-infected samples. the MERS-CoV samples harvested at 6 h and 24 h p.i. clustered outside the mock-infected samples. this suggests an increased diversity in the host response compared with that of the mock-infected samples at these time points. the lines at the top of the heat maps indicate the relative similarity between the conditions listed along the bottom edge of the heat maps. lines on the left side of the heat maps indicate the relative similarity of the signal between the 300 individual peptide targets. the signaling pathways identified to be modulated at 6 h and 24 h p.i. decreased in overall breadth and complexity compared to the breadth and complexity of the pathways identified to be modulated at the 1-h time point. by the 24-h time point the majority of upregulated signaling pathways were related to cell junctions (adherens junction and tight junction pathways) functional network analysis (FNA) provides predicted biological networks in which signaling intermediates are grouped on the basis of similarities in overall cellular responses. the top two functional networks for each time point are presented in Fig. 2. network 2 (cell morphology, cellular function and maintenance, cell cycle) results at 24 h postinfection. 14 kinase kinase kinases represent direct interactions between proteins. the associated biological functions of this network were identified to be cellular movement, cell death and survival, and the cell cycle. the associated biological functions of this network were identified to be cellular movement, cell death and survival, and the cell cycle. results represent those from one experiment (mean SD, n = 3), and the experiment was repeated twice. kinase inhibitors targeting PI3K/AKT/mTOR and ERK/MAPK signaling inhibit MERS-CoV infection. inhibition of PI3K/AKT signaling with wortmannin resulted in 40% inhibition of MERS-CoV infection at the highest concentration tested. inhibition decreased to 22% at submicromolar concentrations. kinase inhibitors were added either preinfection (1 h) or postinfection (+2 h) the results represent those from three experimental repeats (mean SD, n = 3), with two technological repeats being performed in each experiment. pretreatment of cells with inhibitors of ERK/MAPK signaling resulted in the inhibition of MERS-CoV infection. MERS-CoV was largely insensitive to pretreatment of cells with inhibitors for Src (PP2), epidermal growth factor receptor (AG490) or NOS2 (l-NAME) to further assess the role for these kinases or signaling pathways in MERS-CoV infection. licensed therapeutics targeting the same pathways would also have inhibitory activity against MERS-CoV infections. we selected inhibitors targeting AKT (miltefosine), mTOR (everolimus), ERK/MAPK (selumetinib, trametinib) and Raf (dabrafenib, sorafenib) inhibitory activity was reduced when sorafenib was added to cells at 2 h following infection (30% inhibition at the highest concentration tested) dabrafenib, an inhibitor that also targets Raf, had reduced inhibitory activity against MERS-CoV compared to the activity of sorafenib (45%) when added to cells postinfection. kinase inhibitors were added before or after MERS-CoV infection. trametinib was significantly more inhibitory than selumetinib at 0.1 M (P 0.05) for postaddition experiments, trametinib was significantly more inhibitory than selumetinib at 1 M (P 0.005) a single preinfection addition of either selumetinib or trametinib resulted in a significant decrease in viral titers. a single preinfection addition of either selumetinib or trametinib resulted in a significant decrease in viral titers. temporal kinome analysis of MERS-CoV-infected hepatocytes. our arrays contained 340 unique peptides representing key phosphorylation events from a broad spectrum of cell signaling pathways and processes. hierarchical clustering analysis demonstrated that the MERS-CoV-infected sample harvested at 1 h p.i. clustered between the mock-infected samples, while the MERS-CoV samples harvested at 6 h and 24 h p.i. clustered outside the mock-infected samples. mock-infected control data sets were compiled into a data set for each time point for comparative analysis. the lines at the top of the heat maps indicate the relative similarity between the conditions listed along the bottom edge of the heat maps. pathway overrepresentation analysis was performed with both the InnateDB and the IPA software suites. ing pathways related to cell proliferation (cancer/carcinoma, growth factor signaling) and cell growth and differentiation (p53 effectors, Wnt signaling) were upregulated. multiple proinflammatory signaling pathways (tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-] and interleukin-1 [IL-1]) and innate immune response signaling pathways (Toll-like receptor [TLR] signaling) were downregulated at this time point. p.i. signaling pathway data confirmed by kinome analysis at 24 h p.i. in MRC5 cells. this provides further evidence for a central role for PI3K/AKT/mTOR and ERK/MAPK signaling intermediates. the top two functional networks for each time point are presented in Fig. 2. network 1 (cell morphology, cellular function and maintenance, and carbohydrate metabolism) results at 6 h postinfection. network 2 (cell morphology, cellular function and maintenance, cell cycle) results at 24 h postinfection. 14 kinases were conserved among data sets from the three p.i. time points. the associated biological functions of this network were identified to be cellular movement, cell death and survival, and the cell cycle. Western blot array analysis of select phosphorylation events in MERS-CoV-infected cells. results are presented as the mean SD. results represent those from one experiment (mean SD, n = 3), and the experiment was repeated twice. at the highest concentration of kinase inhibitors tested (10 M), all kinase inhibitors had negligible (10%) cytotoxic effects. inhibition of PI3K/AKT signaling with wortmannin resulted in 40% inhibition of MERS-CoV infection at the highest concentration tested. inhibition decreased to 22% at submicromolar concentrations. the cytotoxicities for all compounds at the highest concentration tested (10 M) were 10%, with the exception of those of PKC-412 and Ro 31-8220 (20% and 23%, respectively) the results represent those from three experimental repeats (mean SD, n = 3), with two technological repeats being performed in each experiment. inhibition of MERS-CoV infection by Ro 31-8220 and GF109203X was significantly greater than that by PKC-412 (P 0.1) cells were also pretreated with Bay 11-7082, an inhibitor of NF-B DNA binding and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-)-induced IB phosphorylation. 31-8220 resulted in a modest conservation of inhibitory activity (46%). this was similar to that achieved with GF109203X (56%) and rapamycin (Fig. 3B) licensed therapeutics targeting the same pathways would also have inhibitory activity against MERS-CoV infections. inhibitors of Raf, a MAP3K found downstream of the Ras family of membrane GTPases. pretreatment with sorafenib strongly inhibited MERS-CoV infection (93%) the inhibitory activity was reduced when sorafenib was added to cells at 2 h following infection (30% inhibition at the highest concentration tested) the results represent those from three experimental repeats. trametinib was significantly more inhibitory than selumetinib at 0.1 M (P 0.05) for the postaddition experiments, trametinib was significantly more inhibitory than selumetinib at 1 M (P 0.005) the results for selumetinib, trametinib, and everolimus were confirmed by traditional plaque reduction assays. a single preinfection addition of either selumetinib or trametinib resulted in a significant decrease in viral titers. kinases have become an important target for the design and development of novel therapeutics (25, 26) there are currently 26 kinase inhibitors with FDA licensure and a continually increasing number at various stages of clinical development. kinome analysis provides a unique opportunity to characterize the molecular host response in the investigation of viral infections. the ERK/MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling networks are critical regulatory pathways for many cell regulatory responses, including cell proliferation and apoptosis. both ERK/MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling responses play important roles in the host response to MERS-CoV infection. a prior analysis of MERS-CoV infection suggested that IFN-related signaling responses were found within the functional networks found at the 1-h-p.i. time point. previous work has demonstrated that viruses modulate host cell signaling networks, including those involving PI3K/AKT/mTOR and ERK/MAPK. inhibitors of mTOR (rapamycin and everolimus) reduced inhibitory activities against MERS-CoV compared to the activities of trametinib and selumetinib. however, conservation of these activities following treatment pre- or postinfection also suggests that mTOR plays a critical role in MERS-CoV infections beyond viral entry. the specific mechanism(s) of inhibition for these inhibitors remains to be determined. many licensed kinase inhibitors have off-site targets that could contribute to the overall antiviral activities reported here. al material supp_59_2_1088__index.html (1,019B, html)."}
