{"summary": "heterologous immunity appears to be a common phenomenon among closely related pathogens, for example, different strains of influenza or DENV. it also occurs among unrelated pathogens, including parasites, protozoa, bacteria, and viruses. Adaptive immunity is believed to be highly specific, meaning entirely distinct responses can be mounted against different infections. heterologous immunity occurs among individuals suffering from certain infections that exist in nature as closely related serotypes (e.g., DENV and PV). heterologous immunity is commonly observed in persistently infected individuals who experience constant, low-level antigenic stimulation that alters their immunity to other pathogens. the suppression or enhancement of immune responses by concurrent infections can have protective or pathogenic effects. this depends on the features of the immune response to a simultaneously or previously encountered pathogen. a new, incoming pathogen encounters an already polarized immune response. a cascade of inflammatory responses occurs after PRRs are activated by PAMPs. LCMV infection results in activation of Kupffer cells, recruitment of NK cells and T cells. latent viruses can also confer heterologous protection. prolonged infection with CMV has been correlated with greater susceptibility to heterologous infections in elderly animals and humans [18]. CD4 T cell help for CD8 T cells is important for primary and/or memory responses to some bacterial and viral infections. the activity of Tregs varies, depending on the virus and site of infection. depleting natural Tregs using anti-CD25 prior to infection enhances antiviral responses with virtually no enhanced immunopathology in a footpad model of HSV-1 infection. activity has been suggested as a primary means of increasing the effective size of the TCR repertoire. the same TCR can recognize different peptide-MHC complexes. cross-reactivity can be caused by amino acid sequence similarity between epitopes. cross-reactivity can narrow an otherwise oligoclonal TCR repertoire. cross-reactive CD8 T cells have been detected in multiple heterologous viral infections. outcome appears to depend, in part, on whether IFN- plays a protective or pathogenic role. a narrowed repertoire with a high-affinity clone in some circumstances may be beneficial during the early phase of infection [50], but it may also drive the increased generation of escape variants. a heterologous challenge may force the recruitment of T cells that are not dominant clones but are expanded by the alternative epitope. hierarchies of CD8 T cell responses specific for different peptide-MHC epitopes derived from the pathogen may be dominant, codominant, or subdominant. cross-reactivity can alter the normal immunodominance hierarchy. in mice, a heterologous PV infection results in the otherwise subdominant NP (205\u2013212) epitope becoming dominant. attrition of pre-existing CD8 T cells is an important component of protective immunity to viral infections. evidence has shown that under some conditions of heterologous challenge, pre-existing immunity erodes. the effect observed is attrition of previously existing memory T cells early during infection, in association with the IFN response. the concept of profound attrition of memory CD8 T cells on exposure to new pathogens may have depended on the ability of those infections to stimulate Type I IFNs. this can induce high levels of apoptosis in memory T cells early [57]. PD1 is involved in the attrition of CMV-specific memory CD8 T cells. if several infections occur simultaneously or within close intervals, a pathogen could become persistent and held at low levels by a suboptimal immune response. if the host experiences new infections, viral load increases, as does the total CD8 T cell memory pool. LCMV-infected mice have altered immune kinetics compared with naive animals. IAV-induced memory CD8 and/or CD4 T cells play a role in enhancing lung immunopathology. in some cases, immunopathology is regulated by factors other than traditional immune mediators. sequential viral infections do not initiate the onset of autoimmune disease, but they can clearly alter the course of the disease. a second infection with LCMV resulted in more damaging pathology of the CNS [75]. dimultaneous infection can enhance immunopathology, potentially as a result of the immune responses to both viruses. prior infection can result in activation of APC so that a subsequent infection encounters mature APC, resulting in more efficient antigen presentation and faster disease progression and resolution. a cascade of inflammatory responses occurs after PRRs are activated by PAMPs. LCMV infection results in activation of Kupffer cells, recruitment of NK cells and T cells. latent viruses can confer heterologous protection. LCMV immune mice were adoptively transferred into naive mice. they resulted in heterologous immunity upon subsequent infections with Pichinde virus or VV. however, the specific functions of heterologous CD4 T cell immunity have not been well-characterized thus far. depleting natural Tregs using anti-CD25 prior to infection enhances antiviral responses with virtually no enhanced immunopathology. other anti-inflammatory mechanisms, such as galectin-9 and T cell Ig domain and mucin domain 3 signaling, can also potentially modulate the virus-specific responses to subsequent infections. subsequent infections may encounter an immunosuppressive state that may limit the host's ability to clear the second infection. cross-reactivity can be caused by amino acid sequence similarity between epitopes. a likely reason for this is that Kb presents an 8-aa peptide epitope instead of the 9-aa peptide, usually presented by Db. cross-reactivity can narrow an otherwise oligoclonal TCR repertoire. a diverse repertoire of T cells is established to a variety of immunodominant epitopes [40] whose TCRs recognize antigens presented by MHC molecules. a diverse repertoire of T cells is important, as it may improve pathogen control and reduce the possibility of immune evasion. a heterologous challenge may force the recruitment of T cells that are not dominant clones but are expanded by the alternative epitope. if the normal naive repertoire is narrow, heterologous infection can result in diversification by recruitment of nondominant clones. a heterologous PV infection, followed by LCMV infection, results in the otherwise subdominant NP epitope becoming dominant. the original repertoire elicited by one infection can be altered drastically by a new, unrelated pathogen. cross-reactivity by itself may not be the sole factor responsible for altered hierarchies. in latent murine CMV infection, a pronounced alteration occurs that is consistent with impaired, naive T cell function. heterologous immunity compromises the memory response against an antigen encountered previously. this finding raises the disturbing possibility that vaccines that generate sufficient quantities of memory CD8+ T cells specific for previous infections could have catastrophic consequences for the host. a group found that after infection with LM, adoptively transferred transgenic T cells that were not specific for LM antigens were depleted as a result of a lack of cognate antigen recognition. the stable survival of memory CD8 T cells in mice can be disrupted by subsequent heterologous viral or bacterial infections. viral load increases, as does the total CD8 T cell memory pool. a progressive deterioration in the memory CD8 T cell compartment and failure to control new challenges. naive animals infected with VV suffer a severe outcome. immunopathology is regulated by factors other than \u201ctraditional\u201d immune mediators. in some cases, immunopathology is regulated by factors other than \u201ctraditional\u201d immune mediators. for example, influenza infection triggers a generalized stress response. this leads to a sustained increase in serum glucocorticoid levels. heterologous immunity occurs in viral infections, such as IAV, EBV, HCV, and DENV, with the consequences varying from protective immunity to enhanced immunopathology. the immune system shapes the within-host composition of these resident viruses, and the viruses, in turn, impact host immunity and affect human health [80]. HCV encodes a HLA-A2-restricted epitope, NS31073-1081. T cells from influenza immune individuals with no previous history of HCV infection responded to the HCV epitope in vitro. many people may be partially immune to HCV as a consequence of this cross-reactivity. the number of pre-existing memory T cells in peripheral blood was not affected by the appearance of CD8+ T cells specific for the new CMV infection. in humans, a robust CD8+ T cell response creates a new memory CD8+ T cell niche without substantially depleting pre-existing memory. bystander activation of CD8+ T cells occurs in the absence of cognate antigen. most of these cells are activated by nonspecific mechanisms, including cytokine-driven activation. but the definitive mechanisms of bystander T cell activation in humans remain to be determined. the activation/proliferation state of the herpes virus-specific CD8+ T cells counteracts the attrition exerted by the expansion of the CD8+ T cells specific to the acute infection [90]. if the activation of the CD8+ T cells counteracts the attrition exerted by the expansion of the CD8+ T cells specific to the acute infection, those T cells could proliferate and dominate the subsequent response. PBMCs from six of 10 patients, who were CMV-seronegative, failed to recognize any of the 13,000 CMV-encoded peptides tested. the two seronegative patients showed very limited recognition of HSV-2 peptides. this may not be the most optimal system for stimulating and detecting cross-reactive CD8 T cells that generally recognize shorter peptides. cross-reactivity was detectable in some cases of acute mononucleosis. a subset of the IAV epitope M158.13-specific TCR repertoire was activated to proliferate. cross-reactive T cells expanded more rapidly than the EBV-specific, naive T cells following infection. secondary DENV infection causes sudden vascular permeability generated by cytokines released when T cells attack dengue-infected cells. cross-reactive antibodies opsonize the virus, thereby facilitating its uptake by macrophages, where productive viral replication occurs. pathogenesis of HCV is extremely variable in humans, from asymptomatic infection to a highly pathogenic disease progression. pathogenesis of HCV is extremely variable in humans, from asymptomatic infection to a highly pathogenic disease progression. many people may be partially immune to HCV as a consequence of this cross-reactivity. less-effective, cross-reactive memory CD8 T cells preferentially expanded over T cells with greater avidity to the new serotype that is causing present infection. this suggests that less-effective, cross-reactive memory CD8 T cells preferentially expanded over T cells with greater avidity to the new serotype that is causing present infection. PD1 is important in the attrition of CMV-specific CD8+ T cells during acute infection of HBV. one study reported a half-life of 8\u201316 years for VV-specific CD8+ T cells. however, VV-specific CD8+ T cells were not detectable in 50% of subjects who had been vaccinated >20 years earlier. cells and total T cells were analyzed in patients with an infection of acute hepatitis B, DENV, influenza, or adenovirus. the activation/proliferation state of herpes virus-specific CD8+ T cells counteracts the attrition exerted by the expansion of the CD8+ T cells specific to the acute infection. cross-reactivity between T cells and viral epitopes has less potential than expected. one study failed to detect recognition of any of the >6000 VV-encoded peptides from patients prior to immunization. PBMCs from six of 10 patients failed to recognize any of the 13,000 CMV-encoded peptides tested. human commensal bacteria Finegoldia magna were stimulated to proliferate. exposure to one microbe can stimulate immune cells specific for an entirely unrelated microbe, most likely via cross-reactivity among the peptides. this finding suggests that exposure to one microbe can stimulate immune cells specific for an entirely unrelated microbe. transplantation Heterologous immunity is a major concern in tolerance induction. a transplant recipient's prior infection history can govern his/her responsiveness to alloantigens. a critical threshold of memory T cells is needed to promote graft rejection. if pathogenic cross-reactive memory T cells are identified, vaccines could be designed with careful elimination of these epitopes. cross-reactive memory CD8 T cells have been shown to correlate directly with disease severity upon heterologous challenge. if pathogenic epitopes are required to be included in a vaccine, then tolerization to certain peptides to prevent immunopathology in susceptible individuals may be useful. the use of anti-TNF therapies to treat various diseases may be relatively safe, perhaps, in large part, as a result of heterologous immunity. a large pool of memory T cells can cross-react with any new pathogen and mediate heterologous, protective immunity. anti-CD25, rapamycin, and blocking mAb have all been reported to act synergistically with a costimulation blockade to inhibit allograft rejection. however, ongoing viral infections could be a barrier to the successful induction of allograft tolerance. cross-reactive memory CD8 T cells can be measured to determine if a narrow cross-reactive repertoire has been selected. cross-reactive responses have been shown to be protective in some cases and might hold promise as an effective vaccination strategy. mouse/human Modified heat-labile bacterial toxin Divergent/unrelated pathogens Protective Respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, or the fungus C. neoformans Mouse [12] Tuberculosis and HIV Divergent/unrelated pathogens No effect on Type 2 responses elicited by filaria-protective responses to L. major Simultaneous Type 1 and Type 2 responses. responses to VV Heterologous CD4 T cell immunity mediated by IFN- Mouse [3] HSV-2 and HIV Divergent/unrelated pathogens Worsens HIV pathology Treg-mediated suppression of HIV-specific cytolytic T cell function Human [21] LCMV and VV Divergent/unrelated pathogens LCMV immune mice protected from VV challenge Heterologous immunity mediated by memory CD8 T cells Mouse [37] Influenza virus and RSV Divergent"}
