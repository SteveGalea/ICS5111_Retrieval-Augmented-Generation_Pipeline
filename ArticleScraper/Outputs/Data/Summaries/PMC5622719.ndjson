{"summary": "AMP-activated kinase (AMPK), a phylogenetically conserved serine/threonine protein kinase, is a key regulator of energy metabolic homeostasis. AMPK is considered an attractive target for the prevention of diseases such as obesity, diabetes, inflammation and cancer. hemsl. is a fast growing ornamental tree, native to Mainland China. it is renowned as a polyphenol rich plant, which has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of hypertension, enteritis, tonsillitis, bronchitis and dysentery [7,12,13]. luteolin, luteolin, and apigenin (>99%) were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (Saint Louis, MO, USA) all other solvents and reagents were purchased from Shanghai Yongye Biotechnology Co., Ltd. or Shanghai Yuanye Biotechnology Co., Ltd. flavonoids were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) according to the method described with slight modifications [17,18]. a library was made, comprising retention times on HPLC and spectra of standard chemical compounds. human hepatoma-derived HepG2 cells were cultured and treated previously described. cells were treated with EPF (10\u2013100 g/mL) or FFA (0.25\u20132 mM) cellular triglyceride was detected with related kits. mice in group III and group IV were fed a high fat diet (HFD) and given EPF in distilled water containing 0.1% Tween 80 at a dose of 100 mg/(kg day) by oral gavage. the food intake and body weight of the animals were measured daily. Insulin resistance (IR) and the homeostatic index of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were determined as described previously. 2.7. Oil Red O Staining Oil Red O was used to stain intracellular lipids as described previously. luteolin, luteolin, and apigenin (>99%) were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (Saint Louis, MO, USA) all other solvents and reagents were purchased from Shanghai Yongye Biotechnology Co., Ltd. or Shanghai Yuanye Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) HPLC analyses were performed on an Agilent 1100 series liquid chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) consisting in a binary pump, an autosampler and a diode-array detector (DAD) elution was performed with solution A, composed of 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 3.3) and 10% methanol. solution B, comprising 70% methanol, delivered at a flow rate of 1.0 mL human hepatoma-derived HepG2 cells were cultured and treated previously described. cells were treated with EPF (10\u2013100 g/mL) or FFA (0.25\u20132 mM) cellular triglyceride (TG) was detected with related kits. mice were fed a high fat diet (HFD) containing 21.3% kcal carbohydrate, 18.4% kcal protein, and 60.3% kcal fat, with a total energy of 5.1 kcal/g. mice were fed a standard normal chow diet (SND) and received EPF in distilled water containing 0.1% Tween 80 at two doses 50 and 100 mg/(kg day) ELISA kit according to manufacturer's instructions. Insulin resistance (IR) and the homeostatic index of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were determined as described previously. the average daily food intake per mouse was greater in group I (control) than that in group II (HFD group) treatment with EPF 50 and 100 mg/kg significantly ameliorated HFD-induced additional weight gain and calorie intake. data represent mean standard error (SE) of 10 individual mice. values that do not share a common superscript differ significantly at p 0.05.

AMPK inhibition reduces the effect of EPF on lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. pG2 cells were treated with 1 mM FFA mixture for 24 h. DMSO (0.1%) was treated as a vehicle for EPF. control cells were treated only with 1% BSA. significant differences were assessed by one-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s post hoc test. each value is expressed as mean SEM (n = 7) values that do not share a common superscript differ significantly at p 0.05. luteolin 7-O-glucoside and Apigenin were major flavonoids in the extract of P. fortunei flowers. the average daily food intake per mouse was greater in group I (control) than that in group II (HFD group) data represent mean standard error (SE) of 10 individual mice. values that do not share a common superscript differ significantly at p 0.05. fat-rich diet led to higher serum aminotransferase activities. a HOMA-IR 1.16 0.02 a 3.73 0.04 b 2.11 0.05 c 1.69 0.03 d 1.16 0.01 a TC (mM) 2.92 0.21 a 7.06 0.34 b 5.27 0.19 c 4.46 0.32 d 2.91 0.16 a TG (mM) 0.83 0.11 a 1.57 0.14 b 1.19 0.12 c 0.97 0.09 d 0.82 0.14 a HDL (m no significant differences in blood glucose, plasma insulin and HOMA-IR were found between the normal diet supplied with the EPF group and the control group. no significant differences in blood lipid levels were found between the normal diet supplied with the EPF group and the control group. significant differences were assessed by one-way ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s post hoc test. values that do not share a common superscript differ significantly at p 0.05. expression levels of phosphorylated AMPK increased in a dose-dependent manner. after treatment with compound C, the phosphorylated AMPK levels in HepG2 cells were significantly reduced. AMPK inhibition reduces the effect of EPF on lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. the cells were treated with 1 mM FFA mixture for 24 h.

Interestingly, EPF treatment markedly decreased serum TC, TG and LDL levels and increased HDL levels in HFD mice after eight weeks. AMPK plays important roles in regulating energy status and lipid metabolism, which is also potential therapeutic target for many prevalent diseases, including diabetes, obesity, and high blood pressure. AMPK can mediate lipid metabolism in livers by regulating expression levels its target genes. previous report showed that AMPK coordinates the long-term adaptation of lipid metabolism by regulating the transcriptional factor SREBP-1c. flavonoid extracted from plants could inhibit lipid-related metabolic disorders by regulating expression levels of AMPK and SREBP-1c and their target gene HMGCR. hypolipidemic and hypoglycemic effects of EPF to a certain extent. hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia induced by high fat diet mice could decrease insulin receptors, glucose transport and metabolism. AMPK could regulate glucose metabolism insulin resistance by IRS pathway. we propose a possible protective effect of EPF. the results emphasize the importance of dietary intervention in the treatment and/or prevention of diseases induced by HFD."}
