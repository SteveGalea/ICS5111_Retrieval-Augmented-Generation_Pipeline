{"summary": "the order Nidovirales includes the Coronaviridae that contains viruses with the largest known RNA genome, of around 30 Kb [1], [2]. in humans, CoVs produce respiratory tract infections, causing from the common cold to severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that may result in death. coV replication occurs in the cytoplasm, leading to dsRNA species that trigger the host antiviral response. genus CoV non structural protein (nsp)1 protein promotes host mRNA degradation in order to suppress host innate immune response. TGEV is a genus a1 CoV that contains three accessory genes. the deletion of gene cluster 3ab demonstrated that these genes were not essential for in vitro and in vivo viral replication. TGEV gene 7 is located at the 3\u2032end of the genome, being the last ORF. the function of protein 7 has not been identified, and it has been proposed that it could play a role in virulence [52], [53] the specific role that gene 7a plays in attenuation is not clear, as the specific role that gene 7a plays in attenuation is not clear. mutations introduced to generate a rTGEV-7 virus, right panel. rTGEV-wt (wt) and rTGEV-7 (7, red) viruses, at a moi of 5. total RNA was extracted at 8 hpi. rTGEV virus lacking gene 7 encodes a 78 amino acid hydrophobic protein. the structure predicted for protein 7 contains two transmembrane domains (TM) at the amino- (aa 1\u201318) and carboxy-termini (aa 60\u201378), of the protein. the absence of subgenomic mRNA-7 in rTGEV-7 infected cells was confirmed by Northern-blot. intracellular RNA was only analyzed during those times post infection in which viable cells were bound to the plate. both mutant and parental viruses showed the same virus growth kinetics and gRNA accumulation. permeabilization, propidium iodide (PI) staining and flow cytometry distinguish dying or subdiploid cells from normal cells that emit a high PI fluorescence signal. rTGEV-7 caused a significant increase in cell death compared with that caused by rTGEV-wt infection. mutant rTGEV-7 also triggered apoptosis but faster and stronger than that caused by the rTGEV-wt virus. apoptosis levels in mock, rTGEV-wt (wt) and rTGEV-7 (7) cells were evaluated at 4, 8 and 12 hpi. caspase 3 activation leads to TGEV N protein cleavage. inhibition of caspase 3 processing prevents TGEV induced apoptosis. rTGEV-7 triggered caspase 3 processing faster than wild-type virus. coVs produce viral mRNAs that are structurally similar to those produced by their host (5\u2032 CAP-structure and poly A at the 3\u2032end), allowing coVs to parasitize the host translational machinery. selective viral protein synthesis occurs concomitantly with host translational inhibition, using a mechanism not fully characterized [73], [74] the boxes represent the region of the gel used for densitometry analysis. the amount of radiolabeled N protein was related to the estimated total amount of protein, at the indicated hpi. in principle, RNA decay could be responsible for the observed translational shutoff. cellular RNA cleavage increase during rTGEV-7 infection was due to an enhancement of dsRNA induced antiviral activity. cells transfected with poly(I:C) showed the same RNA degradation pattern as those infected with the rTGEV-7 and parental viruses. total RNA extracted from infected ST cells, at indicated times post infection, was analyzed using a Bioanalyzer. the position of 28S and 18S rRNAs are indicated. rTGEV-7 was evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) rTGEV-wt infection induced the expression of the 2\u2032-5\u2032OAS1 gene expression. rTGEV-7 infection also activated this pathway. rTGEV-7 infection also activated this pathway. no degradation of viral mRNAs was detected after infection by rTGEV-wt or rTGEV-7 (red) viruses. the ratio of sg mRNA to genomic RNA is represented. r.u., relative units. no difference was found in eIF4G processing at different times post infection by wild-type or mutant viruses. eIF2 phosphorylation, during rTGEV infection, was analyzed by Western-blot using antibodies specific for the phosphorylated (eIF2-P) and total forms of this factor, respectively. wild-type infection increased eIF2-P levels (Figure 8A), reaching a maximum at 8 hpi (Figure 8B) eIF2 and eIF2-P amounts were estimated by densitometric analysis. the graph represented eIF2/eIF2-P ratio in mock (green), rTGEV-wt (blue) and rTGEV-7 (red) cells at indicated hpi. infection of ST cells by rTGEV-7 caused stronger apoptosis than rTGEV-wt virus. infection of ST cells by rTGEV-7 caused higher RNA degradation. protein 7 provided in trans significantly reduced apoptosis. tagged protein 7 was detected with an anti-HA antibody stained in green. cell nucleus were stained in blue. tagged protein 7 corresponds to tagged protein cleaved form (7 KDa) PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) is activated by ER stress, and could participate in eIF2 phosphorylation during viral infection. no significant differences were observed between rTGEV-wt and rTGEV-7 virus infections, either in PKR-phosphorylation levels or total PKR protein accumulation. protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) is one of the major Ser/Thr phosphatases. it is the main enzyme responsible for the eIF2 dephosphorylation. similar protein levels were detected in rTGEV-wt and rTGEV-7 infected cells. rTGEV-wt and rTGEV-7 virus infections trigger the cell antiviral response, leading to an increased eIF2-P level. in rTGEV-7 infection, the virus could not counteract the high eIF2-P levels, causing translational shutoff and cell damage. the presence of eIF2 on the co-immunoprecipitated samples was also analyzed. this factor was specifically co-immunoprecipitated both by native and mutant TGEV protein 7 and PP1. the interaction between protein 7 and PP1 was also evaluated in the context of TGEV infection. geneBank accession numbers are ADB28914.1, P36313, Q65212, ACR78108 and O75807 respectively. TGEV protein 7-PP1 interaction was evaluated using ST cells, ST-HA-7 cells (7), or a protein 7 mutant lacking the PP1 binding motif (7-mut) rTGEV-7 virus caused an increased RNA degradation and eIF2 phosphorylation levels. native TGEV protein 7 modulated RNA degradation and eIF2 phosphorylation caused by rTGEV-7 virus. eIF2 was also pulled-down by protein 7 mutant. the rTGEV-7 deletion mutant used throughout this paper was generated with an exclusively respiratory tropism. growth in lung of rTGEV-SC11-wt and rTGEV-SC11-7 viruses was similar to that of the previous mutant and wild-type viruses. this behavior correlated with more pronounced clinical symptoms. two- to three-day-old piglets were inoculated with 1107 pfu/pig of rTGEV-SC11-wt and rTGEV-SC11-7 viruses. at indicated days post inoculation two animals per group were sacrificed, and the lung and the gut were harvested. rTGEV-7 pathology was comparable with that observed in piglets 4 days post rTGEV-wt infection. two- to three-day-old piglets were inoculated with 1107 pfu/pig of rTGEV-wt and rTGEV-7. pictures were obtained with a 10x objective. rTGEV membrane protein (M) and cleaved caspase 3 were also immunodetected. mutations introduced into the cDNA were predicted to knock down gene 7 expression with minimum alteration to the 3\u2032end of the viral genome. the absence of subgenomic mRNA-7 in rTGEV-7 infected cells was confirmed by Northern-blot. both mutant and parental viruses showed the same virus growth kinetics and gRNA accumulation. in rTGEV-7 infected cells the infectious foci were larger than those observed in rTGEV-wt infected ones at 16 hpi. this increased CPE progressed until almost no viable cells remained in the rTGEV-7 infection at 24 hpi. the cell death induced by the wild-type virus was analyzed by permeabilization, propidium iodide (PI) staining and flow cytometry. rTGEV-7 virus is the main cause of the cytopathic effect induced by TGEV infection. cells infected either with rTGEV-wt or rTGEV-7 were simultaneously stained with PI and Annexin V. rTGEV-7 triggered apoptosis but faster and stronger than that caused by the rTGEV-wt virus. active caspase 3 was detected using specific antibodies for the cleaved form. -actin was detected as a loading control. it has previously been reported that TGEV virus induces apoptosis following a caspase dependent pathway. no translational stall was detected during rTGEV-wt infection. rTGEV-7 infection inhibited host translational machinery. this translational stop affected both cellular and viral protein synthesis. moi of 1 with rTGEV-wt (wt) and rTGEV-7 (7) viruses were labeled with35S Met-Cys for 30 min. protein extracts were obtained and SDS-PAGE electrophoresis was performed to detect labeled proteins. total RNA was extracted from non-treated or ZVAD-treated cells. the same RNA degradation patterns were observed in both cases. the increased RNA degradation caused by rTGEV-7 virus was independent of nucleases activated by cell apoptosis. VV induced a very slight RNA degradation, that was increased by the co-expression of 2\u2032-5\u2032 OAS and RNase L. the RNA degradation pattern produced by the expression of RNase L system was identical to the one observed after rTGEV-7 infection. in non-infected cells 2\u2032-5\u2032OAS is expressed at background levels. rTGEV-wt infection induced the expression of the 2\u2032-5\u2032OAS1. rTGEV-7 infection also activated this pathway. the total RNA amount loaded from rTGEV-7 infected cells was 1.5 to 2 fold higher than that loaded from rTGEV-wt infected ones. no degradation of viral mRNAs was detected after infection by rTGEV-wt or rTGEV-7. eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) is a well-characterized target of the TGEV-induced apoptosis. no difference was found in eIF4G processing at different times post infection by wild-type or mutant viruses. rTGEV-7 infection also induced eIF2 phosphorylation. rTGEV-7-induced translational shutoff is probably due to an increased and sustained eIF2 phosphorylation during rTGEV infection. total protein was extracted, at indicated times post infection, from ST cells infected at a moi of 5 with rTGEV-wt (wt) and rTGEV-7 (7) viruses. infection of ST cells by rTGEV-7 caused a stronger apoptosis than the rTGEV-wt virus. protein 7 provided in trans significantly reduced apoptosis in rTGEV-7 infected cells. rTGEV-7 produced apoptosis and RNA degradation by protein 7 provided in trans. tagged protein 7 was detected with anti-HA antibody stained in green. tagged protein 7 was detected with an anti-HA antibody stained in green. dsRNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) is a component of dsRNA induced antiviral response. PKR dimerization, and subsequent activation by autophosphorylation, is mediated by its binding to dsRNA [89]. PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) is activated by ER stress, and could participate in eIF2 phosphorylation during viral infection protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) is one of the major Ser/Thr phosphatases. PP1 expression was evaluated by Western-blot. similar protein levels were detected in both rTGEV-wt and rTGEV-7 infected cells. the RVxF motif is sufficient to mediate PP1 binding. the surrounding amino acids are responsible for PP1 binding and allosteric modulation of the enzyme activity. this motif is also present in three viral and several cell proteins. the interaction between protein 7 and PP1 was specific. an HA-tagged protein 7 mutant, lacking PP1 binding motif, did not co-immunoprecipitate PP1 protein. eIF2 was present in the complex formed by TGEV protein 7 and PP1. PP1 binding motif is present in other viral and cellular proteins. this motif is present in human simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) 134.5. geneBank accession numbers are ADB28914.1, P36313, Q65212, ACR78108 and O75807. 2 phosphorylation levels were analyzed in the presence of the protein 7 mutant that did not bind to PP1. the expression of this protein was confirmed by immunofluorescence. as previously observed, rTGEV-7 virus caused an increased RNA degradation and eIF2 phosphorylation caused by rTGEV-7 virus. rTGEV-wt and rTGEV-7 viruses showed similar growth kinetics in the lung. gene 7 deletion mutant virus reached higher titers than parental virus. virulent TGEV strains replicate in the villious epithelial cells of the small intestine and in lung cells, causing severe diarrhea in newborn piglets. two- to three-day-old piglets were inoculated with 1107 pfu/pig of rTGEV-wt and rTGEV-7 viruses by two routes (oral and nasal) in combination. at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 days post inoculation two animals per group were sacrificed. rTGEV-wt (blue) and rTGEV-7 (red) recovered from lung were titrated. tissue injury caused by gene 7 deletion mutant virus was faster than that due to wild-type virus. rTGEV-7 infected tissue edema was also observed as a consequence of strong alveolar congestion. piglets were inoculated with 1107 pfu/pig of rTGEV-wt and rTGEV-7. dsRNA-induced antiviral pathway analyzed in rTGEV-7 infected cells. differential effects observed during rTGEV-7 infection are in red. PP1, the proposed target of protein 7, is in blue. degradation pattern was identical to that observed after specific RNase L activation. protein 7 may be modulating the 2\u2032-5\u2032OAS pathway at a level prior to RNase L activation. PP1 protein 7 provided in trans reduced RNA degradation. MHV [28], MHV [29], and TGEV infected cells. mechanisms for viral mRNA protection at later stages of the viral cycle will require further studies. rTGEV-7 showed an enhanced CPE, in relation to rTGEV-wt. the mutant virus was derived from a highly attenuated virus, only causing 20% piglet death after virus administration. the mutant virus in the Ortego's paper was derived from a highly attenuated virus, only causing 20% piglet death. preliminary results from high throughput gene expression analysis supported this proposal. rTGEV-7 infected piglets showed an accelerated pathology when compared with the rTGEV-wt infected ones. the recovery from the inflammatory response was slower in rTGEV-7 infected animals than in rTGEV-wt ones. protein 7 would benefit both the host, reducing the pathology caused by the infection, and the virus, allowing longer virus persistence and dissemination. the experiments were performed in an animal facility at Pfizer Animal Health, Girona (Permit numbers G9900005 and G9900007) plasmid pBAC-TGEV-7 A recombinant TGEV virus was engineered using a TGEV-SPTV genetic background. mutations required to knock down gene 7 expression were introduced by overlapping PCR using as a template the plasmid pSL-3EMN7. ORF7 RS-Oli 4 SphI RS (5\u2032-CATAGCACAATAGCGTTCTCCACATGCGCATGCA-3\u2032) was digested with SphI and cloned in the same restriction sites of pSL-3EMN7. pSL-3EMN7 was digested with nt 23,464 to 28,700 of the TGEV genome. to generate a rTGEV-7 virus with both enteric and respiratory tropis cells were trypsinized and plated over a confluent ST monolayer grown in 35-mm-diameter plates. total intracellular RNA was extracted at different hours post-infection (hpi) using the RNeasy Mini Kit. caspase inhibitor inhibitor N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (ZVAD.fmk) was added to the cell culture medium at a concentration of 100 M. total RNA was extracted 18 hours post infection, and cell RNA integrity was analyzed as described above. vvT7, vvRL and vv2-5AS were infected at a moi of 2 with vvT7 or vvT7 or vvT7, vvRL and vv2-5AS respectively. total RNA was harvested at 24 hpi, and analyzed by a bioanalyzer.
