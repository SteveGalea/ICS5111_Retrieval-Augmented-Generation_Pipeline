{"summary": "SFVs are exogenous retroviruses enzootic in both New and Old World primates (16\u201318) phylogenetic analyses of SFVs indicate a species-specific distribution of virus strains not unlike that of SIV among some African primate species. SFV is present in highest concentrations in the saliva of infected laboratory macaques and African green monkeys. monkey temples may account for more human-primate contact than any other context. in the world, 45 temple sites contain substantial populations of free-ranging macaques. a group of people worked at or around the Sangeh monkey temple in Bali, Indonesia. macaques were darted opportunistically and sedated with 3 mg/kg of Telazol. six milliliters of blood was placed in a serum separator tube and centrifuged in the field to extract the serum. the remaining blood was stored at \u201320\u00b0C. PCR Detection of SFV DNA was purified from whole blood. antibody reactivity to both p70 and p74 gag-related proteins. \"Touchdown PCR\" was used for both rounds with reaction conditions of initial denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 2 min, followed by 7 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 60\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 45 s. second-round conditions were the same, except 19 cycles were used instead of 33. five hundred ng purified DNA from whole blood was combined in a PCR reaction mixture with a final concentration of 10 mmol/L Tris (pH 9.0), 50 mmol/L KCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 200 mol/L each dNTP, 0.15 mg/mL BSA, 1 m Taq polymerase, and 400 nmol/L of each primer in a total 82 workers from Sangeh agreed to participate in the present study. macaques were sedated with 3 mg/kg of Telazol. macaques were darted opportunistically and sedated with 3 mg/kg of Telazol. six milliliters of blood was placed in a serum separator tube and centrifuged in the field to extract the serum. the remaining blood was placed in a tube containing EDTA. the remaining blood was frozen and stored at \u201320\u00b0C. the presence of SFV DNA was determined spectrophotometrically at optical density 260 nm. five hundred ng purified DNA was combined with a PCR reaction mixture. twenty L of the PCR reaction underwent electrophoresis on a 1% low melting point agarose gel. the PCR product was ligated into the pCR 2.1-TOPO vector by using the TOPO TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA, USA). an SFV DNA plasmid (pSFV-1Lgp), representing long terminal repeat, gag, and pol of SFV-1, was included as a positive PCR control and for determining sensitivity of detection by serial dilution. initial denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 55\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 5 min. the 101-bp product underwent electrophoresis and was processed for DNA sequencing. ranging macaque population was consistent with seroprevalence studies done in captive (25) and other free-ranging macaque populations. blot positive/total (%) Juvenile 2/4 (50.0) Male 2/4 (50.0) Subadult 6/6 (100.0) Male 4/4 (100.0) Female 2/2 (100.0) Adult 26/28 (92.9) Male 19/21 (90.5) Female 7/7 (100.0) serum from a 47-year-old farmer (BH66) was reactive to SFV gag proteins, p70/p74. this man reported that the bite and scratches, which occurred on his hands and toes, had bled and that he had washed the wounds. BH66, 5 of the Sangeh macaques (M. fascicularis) and 13 pet macaques (M. tonkeana, M. maura, and M. fascicularis) were cloned at least twice, sequenced, and compared with published sequences from a rhesus macaque (SFV-1mac, M55279) and an african green monkey (Cercopithecus aethiops) (SFV-3a SFV-1mac represents a published sequence from a rhesus macaque (M. mulatta) and SFV-3agm is a published sequence from an african green monkey (Cercopithecus aethiops) the SFV human strain clustered with an SFV sequence amplified from BP6 one of the macaques at the Sangeh monkey temple. the mtDNA tree was created with the neighbor-joining method with the Phylip program (DNAdist; Neighbor) bootstrap values were 1,000. the phylogenetic tree was plotted in Treeview. 2 (50%) of 4 juveniles, all 6 (100%) subadults, and 26 (93%) of the adults were antibody positive. SFV seroprevalence was consistent with seroprevalence studies done in captive (25) and other free-ranging macaque populations. serum from a 47-year-old farmer (BH66) was reactive to SFV gag proteins, p70/p74. antibodies to the gag precursor proteins (p70/p74) were apparent from the human BH66 blood sample. serum contained antibodies to SFV from BH66, 5 of the Sangeh macaques (M. fascicularis) and 13 pet macaques (M. tonkeana, M. maura, and M. fascicularis) were cloned at least twice, sequenced, and compared with published sequences from a rhesus macaque (SFV-1mac, M55279) and an african green monkey (Cercopithecus ae phylogenetic analysis of simian foamy virus (SFV) DNA from several species of Indonesian primates and an infected human. BP 2, 5, and 6 represent Sangeh monkey temple macaques (Macaca fascicularis) the simian foamy virus\u2013infected person (BH66), 2 human controls (Hu702 and Hu715), M. fascicularis (BP2, 4, 5, 6), M. nemestrina (P46), M. tonkeana (P18,39,40), M. maura (P79, M1), M. nigrescens (M27, 28), and M. hecki (M7) was of human origin. PCR products were sequenced and compared to SFV from other macaque species. previous research on naturally acquired SFV infection among bushmeat hunters in central africa found 10 who seroconverted in a population of 1,099 (1%), of which 3 also had positive results by PCR. the Sangeh Temple Committee estimates 250 people work in and around the monkey forest. of the 82 people who participated in the present study, 28% had been bitten by a macaque. 700,000 tourists visit the 4 main monkey temples on the island of Bali. enzootic primate infectious agents may cross the species barrier and cause significant morbidity and mortality in human populations. the combination of large primate reservoirs, prevalent human-primate contact, and advanced infrastructure in Asia increases the likelihood of a primateborne zoonosis emerging. antibodies to SFV were detected in serum, and SFV genomic segments were amplified from blood of the infected person. PCR products were sequenced and compared to SFV from other macaque species. previous research on naturally acquired SFV infection among bushmeat hunters in central africa found 10 who seroconverted in a population of 1,099 (1%), of which 3 also had positive results by PCR. macaques can become aggressive and will bite or scratch people. local photographers encourage macaques to feed for most of their nutrition. 700,000 tourists visit 4 main monkey temples on island of Bali. SFV infection in humans has not culminated in any observable symptoms. but SFV strains may differ in their capacity to infect or cause disease in humans. the combination of large primate reservoirs, prevalent human-primate contact and advanced infrastructure in Asia increases the likelihood of a primateborne zoonosis emerging on this continent. researchers link natural transmission of SFV to a person to a specific population of primates. these findings have ramifications for the potential global spread of primateborne infectious agents."}
