{"summary": "coVs contain the largest known RNA genomes, ranging from 27 to 32 kilobases in length. the emergence of MERS-CoV in 2012 demonstrates that coVs continue to cause severe and lethal human disease. the discovery of 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 exoribonuclease (ExoN) activity within CoV nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14-ExoN) has challenged the long-held paradigm that RNA viruses cannot proofread. coVs encode several additional RNA-processing functions within their 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp1\u201316) many of these enzymatic functions likely have facilitated the expansion of the CoV genome beyond the 15 kb upper limit. nsp14-ExoN contains four conserved DE-D-D acidic residues. coV nsp14-ExoN performs a proofreading function during coV replication. shown is a linear schematic of the SARS-CoV genome containing both the nonstructural protein (nsp) and the structural and accessory protein open reading frames. nsp14-ExoN is the proofreading component of a multi-subunit polymerase complex. a possible analogy would be the E. coli DNA polymerase III (pol III) core (), which contains a polymerase (subunit), a DEDDh exonuclease (subunit), and an exonuclease stimulatory protein (subunit) fidelity of nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) incorporation for nsp12-RdRp has not been determined. coV nsp12-RdRp would provide essential polymerase activity. nsp10 also plays a critical yet undefined role in viral polyprotein processing and RNA synthesis. coVs encode an enhancer of ExoN activity within nsps 8, 9 and 13. the presence of such a complex might allow for greater control, and potentially active regulation, of replication fidelity. nsp13 could function ahead of the polymerase complex and unwind the dsRNA. two folds of nsp8 participate in a hexadecameric nsp7-nsp8 supercomplex. it is capable of primer extension and binding RNA, likely due to the presence of a 30 central channel lined with positively charged amino acids. nsp7-nsp8 supercomplex could be analogous to sliding clamp within the pol III holoenzyme. small-molecule inhibitors of ExoN could reproduce this genetic defect. this could render CoVs vulnerable to treatment with RNA mutagens and obligate or non-obligate chain-terminating nucleoside analogs. genome expansion, robustness to mutations, and resistance to mis-incorporations during RNA synthesis provide a powerful model for the study of additional CoV fidelity determinants. the proposed multi-subunit fidelity complex will yield exciting new insights into how coVs ignore the RNA virus playbook."}
