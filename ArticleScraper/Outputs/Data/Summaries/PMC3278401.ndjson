{"summary": "prevalence and severity of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic appeared to vary significantly across populations and geographic regions. we sought to investigate the variability in transmissibility of the 2009 pandemic in different health regions (including urban centres and remote, isolated communities) the basic reproduction number (R0) is defined as the average number of new cases generated by an infectious individual in a fully susceptible population. this quantity, once estimated for a new disease, can be used to identify target strategies for mitigating disease outcomes. following the emergence of the H1N1 pandemic strain, attempts were made to estimate R0, largely for urban population settings [9-12] the Richards model [13] was used to fit to data collected for laboratory-confirmed cases of H1N1 infection in a single outbreak. the model can be expressed as I'= r I 1 - I K a. a generation time of 2.9 days was considered with a standard deviation of 1.4 days for the Gamma distribution with = 4.2 and = 0.68 [24]. a generation time of 2.5 days followed a gamma distribution with shape and scale parameters = 7.72 and = 0.324, respectively. health for both waves of the 2009 pandemic in spring (total of 891 cases between May 2 and August 5) and fall (total of 1,774 cases between October 1, 2009, and January 3, 2010) only health regions with more than 50 identified cases were considered for this study. this model describes the epidemic dynamics in two phases of fast and slow infection spread with a transition point (turning point), at which the maximum rate of disease incidence occurs. in the slow phase of infection spread, the epidemic peaks and subsequently declines, and therefore the cumulative number of cases eventually saturates at the final size K. turning points of the outbreaks were also estimated by determining the inflection points at which I(tm) = K/(1 + )1/. previous work has referred to the parameter as the turning point, which is theoretically incorrect. the first case of H1N1 infection in Manitoba was identified (tested positive) on may 2, 2009. data were reported by the earliest date of symptom onset, initial care, specimen collection, hospital admission, and/or intensive care unit admission. estimates correspond to the best fit of the Richards model to the cumulative number of confirmed cases. 95% confidence interval for R0 corresponds to the average generation time of 2.9 days. region R0 (95% CI) Burntwood 2.10 (1.83-2.68) Brandon 1.65 (1.50-1.95) North Eastman 1.62 (1.52-1.78) Central 1.56 (1.49-1.65) Norman 1.53 (1.43-1.71) Assiniboine 1.43 (1.40-1.46) Interlake 1.48 (1.39-1.63) Interlake 1.51 (1.43-1.64) Winnipeg 1.81 (1.67-2.03) Manitoba 1.60 (1.51-1.74) Manitoba 1.59 the turning points of epidemics started in the first week of June 2009. the earliest in burntwood on June 5 and the latest in north eastman on June 14. the estimated turning points indicate a more rapid spread of disease in northern part of the province. best fits for Burntwood, Winnipeg, and the entire province of Manitoba for the spring wave are illustrated in Figure 2a-c. occurrence of pandemic outbreaks appeared to be associated with geographic shift from northern Manitoba (e.g., Burntwood, North Eastman, and Norman) in the first wave to more southern parts of the province (e.g., Assiniboine, Central, and Brandon) in the second wave. estimates for the first wave indicate that the plausible range of R0 for the entire province of Manitoba is virtually identical to that obtained for its largest urban centre (the Winnipeg health region) estimates of R0 reduce with a mean value of 2.1 (Table 3) but remain above those of the Winnipeg health region with the average generation time of 2.9 days. the turning points of epidemics started in the first week of June 2009, with the earliest in Burntwood on June 5 and the latest in North Eastman on June 14. occurrence of pandemic outbreaks appeared to be associated with geographic shift from northern Manitoba (e.g., Burntwood, North Eastman, and Norman) in the first wave to more southern parts of the province (e.g., assiniboine, Central, and Brandon) in the second wave, transmissibility appears to have been lower for the entire province than the Winnipeg health region. severe outbreaks were observed in several locations in the province of Manitoba during the first wave, most notably in communities in the burntwood, Norman and North Eastman health regions. the higher estimates of R0 in the first wave of the 2009 pandemic are linked to outbreaks in remote and isolated communities, and populations of relatively small size. the parameter R0 has a clear biological significance: it determines how fast the infection will spread through a population that has been previously unexposed to the disease. the parameter R0 has a clear biological significance: it determines how fast the infection will spread through a population that has been previously unexposed to the disease. a less conservative strategy might include a broader coverage of antiviral drugs. antiviral use for treatment and post-exposure prophylaxis is far more economical than hospitalization or intensive care. without a virus-specific vaccine, antiviral medication may be the only pharmaceutical option. estimates of R0 for the first wave may be affected by pre-existing immunity. the effect of pre-existing immunity becomes more pronounced by the reduced level of susceptibility due to infection in the spring wave. authors' contributions Conceived, designed the study, and collected data: SM.
