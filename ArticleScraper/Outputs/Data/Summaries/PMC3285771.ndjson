{"summary": "mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is a murine coronavirus which causes a wide range of diseases in the mouse and rat, including hepatitis, enteritis, respiratory diseases, and encephalomyelitis in the central nervous system. complex factors, such as age and immunological status of the host animal, dose, and route of virus inoculation, affect disease outcomes. susceptibility was determined by a single gene, expressed in macrophages. the locus of the gene that determines the susceptibility of mice to MHV infection is on chromosome 7. it was postulated that mouse susceptibility to MHV infection is dominant. yle et al., 1987; Williams et al., 1990; yle et al., 1987; yle et al., 1990; yle et al., 1987; yle et al., 1990; yle et al., 1987; Williams et al., 1990; yle et al., 1987; yle et al., 1987; yle et al a slight difference in amino acid sequences between CEACAM1a and CEACAM1a found in most mouse strains. these are allelic forms and called CEACAM1a for BALB/c type and CEACAM1b for SJL type. no significant difference in viral growth between cells expressing CEACAM1a and those with CEACAM1b. alternative splicing generates molecules with two ectodomains. some CEACAM1 molecules deleting TM and Cy were found in intestinal epithelium and intestinal secretions, and those neutralize MHV. the spike (S) protein with ca. 180\u2013200 kDa class I fusion glycoprotein is cleaved in the middle of the molecule, and the N terminal subunits S2 are responsible for receptor binding. we have compared the virus-binding activity of CEACAM1a and CEACAM1b. this may be due to its short molecule that is buried among various cell surface molecules and thus fails to have a chance to attach to the virions. by this method, CEACAM1a neutralizes MHV more than 300-fold efficiently than does CEACAM1b. mice with CEACAM1a/CEACAM1a and CEACAM1a/CEACAM1b are susceptible and only mice with a CEACAM1b/CEACAM1b phenotype, such as SJL mice, are resistant. some amino acids 34\u201352 are involved in virus-binding (Wessner et al., 1998). most of wild mice distributed worldwide express either CEACAM1a and CEACAM1b. mice with CEACAM1b showed high susceptibility to MHV. those with CEACAM1b were not highly susceptible to MHV. chimeric CEACAM1a is replaced with 1\u201370 amino acids of the N terminus of N domain with CEACAM1b counterpart. this suggests there is a critical region in 1\u201370 amino acids to determine the difference of receptor functionality between CEACAM1a and CEACAM1b. chimeric CEACAM1ba is more like CEACAM1b rather than CEACAM1a. no virus growth was detected in the mice with gene-replacement with chimeric CEACAM1. the gene-replaced mice showed a much higher resistance to MHV infection than did the SJL mice. the chimeric mouse susceptibility should be similar to that in SJL mice. peritoneal macrophages from chimeric mice were resistant to MHV. chimeric CEACAM1 expressed in cultured cell lines showed MHV susceptibility. from these findings, it could be postulated that some cellular factor(s) other than CEACAM1 could modify animal susceptibility."}
