{"summary": "visitors can play an important role in the transmission and spread of infectious diseases. they can serve as susceptible hosts and be infected while staying in one place. a large number of visitors can have unexpected impacts on public health. game theory can be used to answer questions such as whether travelling or not travelling to a location is optimal according to a criterion of self-interest. the answers it provides can be contrasted with optimal control strategy from the health authority perspective, in terms of maximizing overall population utility. the faster the disease risk information is updated, the more likely a discrepancy will occur. faster updating of the disease risk information could effectively prevent visitor inflow \u2018overload\u2019 and therefore stop an outbreak. the remaining parts of this work are organized as follows. the ranges of the parameters are used for the sensitivity analysis. the point values of the disease parameters reflect influenza. the ranges of the parameters are used for the sensitivity analysis. black arrows represent infection status transition paths and red dashed arrows represent transmission paths. red compartments represent local classes, circular compartments represent visitor classes and the diamond denotes the \u2018decision\u2019 process of potential visitors. r1 denotes perceived cost of morbidity and/or mortality risk. in the case of, we have (; P) = 0 if (see electronic supplementary material, S2.1) this is called perfect herd immunity, i.e. an outbreak cannot occur when the population immunity level is greater than [40,41] we define a mixed strategy where players follow the travelling strategy with a probability p and follow the non-travelling strategy with a probability (1 p). the pay-off function is then 2.4 The game remains unchanged if we scale the pay-off function by we define the group (Pareto) optimum * as the value of for which the population average cost function () of all potential visitors is minimized. individuals of the destination population (excluding visitors) are categorized as susceptible (S, those who may be infected), infectious (I, those capable of transmitting disease) or removed (R, those who are either recovered and immunized or died) we express both K1 and N1 in units of proportion of the population threshold (destination population plus the maximum visitor capacity) and we fix N1. we assume that all trips are 3 days long, hence visitors return at rate (see electronic supplementary material, S6.3). we present the numerical results of the relationship between () and in electronic supplementary material, S2.1. individuals of the destination population are categorized as susceptible (S), those who may be infected, infectious (I, those capable of transmitting disease) or removed (R, those who are either recovered and immunized or died) we express both K1 and N1 in units of proportion of the population threshold (destination population plus the maximum visitor capacity) and we fix N1. We assume that all trips are 3 days long, hence visitors return at rate (see electronic supplementary material, S6.3). individual and population optima have the same qualitative relationship with and r. both optima are monotonically decreasing functions of and monotonically increasing functions of r. sudden transition of the individual optimum from 0 to 1 is steeper than that of the population optimum. a plot of versus the population optimum * and the individual equilibrium p* during an ongoing epidemic ( = 1) show that they agree perfectly for most of the parameter space (figure 3). these two situations can occur when both the disease risk (reflected by ) and perceived risk are (i) either considerably high, i.e. * = p* = 0, in which case no one intends to travel and border entrance restrictions are implemented. the model predicts parameter regimes where the group optimal solution requires a higher volume of travel than what is individually optimal. however, if either the disease risk or the perceived pay-off of disease risk r1 decline even slightly, the situation is reversed. the time point of official start of restrictions on travel refers to the events outbreak announced publicly by government (Apr 20) and fever checks at airports begin (Apr 22) in fig. 1 of Pang et al. [11], we note that these two events resulted in almost no one travelling to Beijing, i.e. = 0, until the end of the SARS epidemic. figure 4b shows a model-simulated epidemic curve that largely matches the observed epidemic curve. we decrease from 0.5 to 0.25 at the time indicated by the blue dashed vertical line. this decrease is associated with the start of public awareness of the SARS risk in Beijing after it was revealed to the public. the earlier the travel restrictions are implemented, the more effectively the disease outbreak level is reduced. an uncontrolled increase in the proportion of visitors (e.g. increasing from 0.5 to 0.75) could yield a larger outbreak. in the baseline model, we assume individuals have accurate knowledge of the real basic reproduction number. however, an imbalance between the perceived and actual could exist. we expect the perceived to correlate positively with the actual. future models including a heterogeneous population could improve the realism of the model. future models including a heterogeneous population could help test the robustness of our predictions. individual and population optima as functions of the basic reproduction number and the relative risk r during an epidemic ( = 1). surprisingly, the sudden transition of the individual optimum from 0 to 1 is steeper than that of the population optimum (as shown in figure 2b) despite the broad agreement across the parameter plane, the region where * and p* are discrepant reveals interesting findings. despite the broad agreement across the parameter plane, the region where * and p* are discrepant reveals interesting findings. figure 3 shows a surprising contrast to many game theoretical models comparing individual and group optimal outcomes. when a discrepancy does emerge, it can emerge very quickly with small changes in parameter values. the individual optimal travel rate could exceed the group optimal rate, or vice versa. the black dashed line is the time series smoothed by using the LOESS function (R v. 3.4.3 ). the initial states are set as [S(0), I(0), S1(0), I1(0)] = [(1 K1), 0, (K1 1 108), 1 108], with, N1 = 15% and = 0.5. the blue and red lines are the simulations under \u2018what if\u2019 scenarios in which travel restriction policies were implemented earlier. the decrease in from 2.5 to 1.75 would correspond to an accompanying reduction of the effective contact rate due to the onset of public awareness of SARS. the time lag, i.e. the gap between the pairs of vertical solid and dashed lines of the same colour in figure 4, is fixed at 3 days due to the mixed effects of the incubation period. sensitivity analysis of the baseline model shows that the results are most sensitive to the relative risk (r), basic reproduction number () and the rate at which individuals leave the destination. in the baseline model, we assume that visitors do not bring infection back to their home country. if we set = 0 for all t by assuming humans receive accurate knowledge of a risk when it emerges, we have. in reality, this assumption can be relaxed, and a reasonable estimate can be used. conclusion Many game theoretical studies of closed socio-epidemiological systems find a significant discrepancy between individual and group optima in a broad range of economic and epidemiological parameters. the discrepancy was very large and highly sensitive to small changes in disease transmissibility and visitor costs/benefits. grant council (PolyU 251001/14M)"}
