{"summary": "WNV alone has accounted for over 20,000 cases of neuroinvasive disease in the united states since it emerged in 1999. human cases of WNV have been documented on all continents except Antarctica making it the most widespread viral cause of encephalitis. insect cells produce less complex carbohydrates compared to mammalian cells. insect cells produce less complex carbohydrates compared to mammalian cells. early cell targets in mouse models are keratinocytes and presumably macrophages and dendritic cells. replicons are an important tool to study a single round of viral infection. replicon genomes are deleted for some or all of the structural protein genes. RPs for WNV are valuable for investigating first round of cell infection from binding and entry to replication of viral RNA. all WNV and RP packaging experiments were conducted in a biosafety level-3 facility. only stocks that did not produce cytopathic effect were used at biosafety level-2. stocks of WNV were produced from an infectious clone by electroporating BHK or C6/36 cells. culture medium was harvested 2 days (BHK cells) or 5 days (C6/36 cells) after electroporation and centrifuged at 15,000 RCF for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0C to remove cellular debris. infectious virus was quantified by plaque assay on Vero cells. RNA was in vitro transcribed using mMESSAGE mMACHINE mRNA kit. lipofection and electroporation of C6/36 and BHK cells. prior to lipofection, 90% of the culture medium was removed. transfection efficiency was determined using in vitro transcribed RNA derived from VEE replicon expressing GFP. cells were mock-inoculated with diluent and lipofected 48 hours later with 1 g VEE replicon RNA. cell culture medium was harvested 48 hours post-electroporation, clarified by centrifugation at 4\u00b0C for 30 min at 10,000 RCF, and stored in aliquots at -80\u00b0C prior to use. some BHK-RP preparations were concentrated to achieve higher titers by ultracentrifugation on a 20% sucrose cushion for 2 hours at 100,000 RCF. replicon antigens were detected with anti-WNV mouse hyperimmune ascites fluid. positive cells were counted for wells of each dilution. replicon antigens were detected with anti-WNV mouse hyperimmune ascites fluid. anti-m antibody (NB100-56743, Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO) was diluted in 1% BSA in 1X Tris-Buffered Saline. antibody-antigen complexes were detected using amersham ECL Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent. the plate was incubated for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C and washed one time with PBS-T. a cocktail of three monoclonal antibodies against WNV E protein (clones H79H, J52Q, and L23S) was used for detection at a final concentration of 1.33 g/mL per antibody. Ipsilateral (side of inoculation) rear footpads, contralateral (side opposite inoculation) rear footpads, ipsilateral popliteal and inguinal lymph nodes, spleens, and 150 L whole blood were added to luciferase lysis buffer (Promega) mice were inoculated with 105 PFU WNV derived from BHK or C6/36 cells. cutoffs for luciferase assay samples were calculated as the average relative light units (RLU) plus three times the standard deviation for tissue samples from mock-inoculated mice. RNA from homogenized tissues, WNV stocks, or RP stocks was isolated using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) stocks tested for recombined full-length WNV by passing 10% of total volume on vero cells for three passages. only stocks that did not produce cytopathic effect were used at biosafety level-2. the alphavirus packaging vector, a semliki forest virus replicon with the structural protein genes (C, E3, E2 and E1) replaced with the structural protein genes C, prM, and E. the packaging vector supplies WNV structural proteins in trans to selectively package WNV replicon RNA. RNA and lipofection reagents were mixed at various ratios and incubated according to manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. RNA and lipofection reagents were mixed at various ratios and incubated according to manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. cells were mock-inoculated with diluent only and lipofected 48 hours later with 1 g VEE replicon RNA mixed with 4L FlyFectin reagent. at 4 days post-lipofection, cells were triedpsinized for flow cytometry analysis. titration was done on vero cells grown to confluence in 96 well plates. ten-fold dilutions of harvested RPs or diluent (mock) were added to the monolayer in triplicate or quadruplicate. complete growth medium was added to the cells and incubated for 2 days. positive cells were counted for wells of each dilution. wells containing 5 to 50 positive cells were used for calculation of particle concentration. the same virus or RP inoculum at an MOI of 1 on vero cells is equivalent to an MOI of 0.1 on C6/36 cells. we adapted a previously described WNV NS1 capture ELISA method [34] Purified polyclonal rabbit antibody against WNV E protein (Novus Biologicals) was coated onto 96-well MaxiSorp plates overnight at 4\u00b0C at 1 g/mL in coating buffer (15 mM Na2CO3, 35 mM NaHCO3, pH 9.6) the plate was washed one time with PBS-T (PBS, 0.05% Tween 20) and goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugate (KPL) at 1:1000 was added and incubated for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C. plate was then washed three times with PBS-T and developed using TMB substrate. mice were inoculated with 105 PFU WNV derived from BHK or C6/36 cells. Ipsilateral rear footpads, ipsilateral inguinal lymph nodes, spleens (approximately three-fourths) and serum samples were processed for infectious virus as previously described. the 3\u2019UTR primer-probe set was used for WNV stocks, RP stocks, and replicon genome in whole blood. a standard curve of WNV RNA was run with each plate. a p-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. novel packaging method produced the first known mosquito cell-derived RPs. titers were increased from 102 RPs/mL on day 2 to 104 RPs/mL on day 5 post-electroporation. cytomix was observed to improve cell survival during electroporation. cytomix is the best electroporation reagent tested for C6/36 cells. cell lysates were harvested each day from 4 to 9 days post-electroporation. cells were lysed 0.5\u20135 days following RNA delivery. each condition was performed in triplicate except for A. different ratios of RNA to lipofection reagent were tested according to manufacturers\u2019 recommendations. the percentage of GFP-positive cells was determined by flow cytometry. a similar transfection efficiency of 0.30.05% was determined using fluorescence microscopy. differences between BHK and C6/36 cell lines limit extrapolation from these data. the optimal time between deliveries of WNV replicon RNA was investigated. a transfection delay of 24 hours yielded titers less than 106 RPs/mL/day from 3\u201310 days post-lipofection. the 48 and 72 hour delays produced equivalent titers by day 3 post-lipofection with peak titers of 5.4x106 RPs/mL/day. after 24, 48, or 72 hpi, cells were transfected with packaging RNA using FlyFectin. transfection medium was replaced with complete growth medium 24 hours after delivery of WNV replicon RNA. media were harvested and replaced every 24 hours for 8\u201310 days post-lipofection. we hypothesized that inoculating cells with a higher MOI of BHK-RPs would increase the number of cells that receive both the replicon and packaging RNAs. we measured the yield of RPs packaged in C6/36 cells after inoculating BHK-RPs at an MOI of 0.05, 0.5, or 1. peak production was observed between 4 and 6 days post-lipofection for all three MOI conditions. peak RP production reached 2.4x104 RPs/mL/day at 4 days post-lipofection. the initial BHK-RP inoculation at high MOI did not increase RP production. the lowest MOI (0.05) was able to produce RPs of sufficient concentration for animal studies. M and prM were easily detected in WNV and RP stocks derived from both C6/36 and BHK cells. cleavage of prM to M indicated that all preparations consisted of fully mature particles. s and 5636 for C6/36-RPs (n = 4) have levels of non-infectious particles expected for virus stocks and within the experimental range for BHK-RPs. c E protein was quantified by capture ELISA using standard curve of recombinant E protein. we quantified the E protein content of WNV and RP stocks by capture ELISA. a higher ratio indicates greater amounts of empty subviral particles. a higher ratio indicates greater amounts of empty subviral particles. no significant differences were observed in the ipsilateral footpad skin through 48 hpi for mice inoculated with the different RP inocula. there was significantly higher luciferase activity in the spleen for BHK-RPs from 3 through 48 hpi compared to C6/36-RPs. there was no spread to the footpad skin on the contralateral leg for either RP inocula. replicon RNA levels were 160-fold (3 hours), 60-fold (6 hours) and 10-fold (12 hours) greater in the blood of mice inoculated with BHK-RPs compared to C6/36-RPs. mice were inoculated in the left rear footpad, and tissues were harvested at 3 and 6 hpi. at these early time points, infectious virus is from the inoculum, and viral RNA is from the inoculum and/or infected cells. the difference was dramatically reduced when the tissues were assayed for WNV RNA. RNA observed for WNV-BHK in whole blood compared to WNV-C6/36. systemic spread to the spleen occurred earlier in mice inoculated with WNV-BHK compared to WNV-C6/36. in vitro transcribed RNA derived from the packaging vector (packaging RNA) was electroporated into C6/36 cells. cells were electroporated with in vitro transcribed RNA derived from the packaging vector (packaging RNA) this method yielded no detectable RPs. small volumes of culture medium containing RPs were harvested 2 to 5 days post-electroporation and titrated for RPs by IFA on Vero cells. cytomix is the best electroporation reagent tested for C6/36 cells. plates were transfected with replicon RNA using three lipofection reagents. cell lysates were harvested at 4 days post-lipofection. luciferase activity was an indicator of transfection efficiency. luciferase values were comparable (approximately 105 RLU) for electroporation with cytomix and lipofection with FlyFectin. transfection efficiency for these parameters was quantified using a VEE replicon RNA that expresses high levels of GFP under the subgenomic promoter. cells lipofected with WNV replicon RNA showed 10-fold higher luciferase activity (104 to 105 RLU) at 12 hours post-lipofection, but greater than 100-fold lower luciferase activity (104 to 105 RLU) 3\u20135 days post-lipofection. delay between delivery of replicon and packaging RNAs may enhance RP production by allowing time for replicon amplification. 72 hour delays produced equivalent titers by day 3 post-lipofection. peak titers were 5.4x106 RPs/mL/day (48 hour delay on 4 days post-lipofection) and 5x106 RPs/mL/day (72 hour delay 6 days post-lipofection) RP production was observed in all packaging experiments. C6/36 cells were transfected with WNV replicon RNA. transfection medium was replaced with complete growth medium 24 hours after each lipofection reaction. medium was harvested and replaced every 24 hours for 11 days. the MOI of BHK-RPs did not correlate with production of C6/36-RPs. a lower MOI for the initial inoculum will result in a C6/36-RP stock with fewer BHK-RPs carried over from the replicon inoculum. RPs were harvested 2\u201311 days post-lipofection. mammalian cell-derived RPs were highest 2 days post-lipofection at 7.6x103 RPs/mL/day and decreased through 5 days post-lipofection to 1.1x102 RPs/mL/day. this amount of BHK-RPs corresponds to less than 0.1% of the C6/36-RPs harvested per day. the ratios of GE:IU were less than 3-fold different for RP and virus stocks derived from the same cell line. the ratios of GE:IU were less than 3-fold different for RP and virus stocks derived from the same cell line. b RNA was isolated from RP or WNV stocks derived from BHK cells or C6/36 cells. c E protein was quantified by capture ELISA using a standard curve of recombinant E protein. subviral particles lack genome and C protein, contain M and E proteins in a lipid bilayer. luciferase activity was detected in the ipsilateral footpad skin and popliteal lymph node as early as 3 hpi for both BHK-RPs and C6/36-RPs. no significant differences were observed in the ipsilateral footpad skin through 48 hpi for mice inoculated with the different RP inocula. there was luciferase activity in the popliteal and inguinal lymph nodes on the contralateral leg of mice at 24 hpi only in mice inoculated with the BHK-RPs. both the BHK-RPs and C6/36-RPs replicated in skin at the inoculation site, draining lymph nodes and spleen. inoculum spread by assaying for luciferase activity and replicon genome by qRT-PCR in whole blood. no luciferase activity was observed in whole blood for either RP inocula. replicon RNA levels were 160-fold (3 hours), 60-fold (6 hours) and 10-fold (12 hours) greater in the blood of mice inoculated with BHK-RPs compared to C6/36-RPs. HK compared to WNV-C6/36, suggesting that WNV-BHK enters cells less efficiently at the site of inoculation. most of the viral RNA in these tissues was from infected cells in the eclipse phase for mice inoculated with WNV-C6/36. 105 PFU of WNV derived from either BHK cells or C6/36 cells were inoculated. Tissues were harvested at 3 or 6 hpi, homogenized, and assayed. each symbol represents a single mouse. replicon RNA is delivered via RP inoculation, and packaging vector RNA is delivered via lipofection. previous studies optimizing RP packaging in mammalian cells observed benefits from delivering the packaging vector 24 hours after delivery of the replicon RNA. a surprising result of our optimization was that RP production did not correlate with the MOI of the RP inoculation. the actual MOI would quickly rise, masking any difference between MOIs upon initial inoculation. we used genome equivalents to infectious unit as a measure of non-infectious to infectious particles. ratio indicates more empty subviral particles compared to C6/36-RPs. it is possible that the higher transfection efficiency in BHK cells compared to C6/36-RPs results in more cells singly transfected with the packaging vector. we observed significantly higher amounts of replicon RNA present in the blood of mice inoculated with BHK-RPs up to 12 hpi compared to mice inoculated with C6/36-RPs. the replicon RNA in the blood does not appear to be due to infected cells since we did not find evidence of RP-infected cells trafficking through the blood at the limit of our luciferase assay. free particles in the inoculum are trafficking to the draining lymph node and entering the blood to infect distant sites. the exact mechanism responsible for these differences in spread from the inoculation site is unknown. the exact mechanism responsible for these differences in spread from the inoculation site is unknown. empty particles are produced in flavivirus-infected mammalian and mosquito cell culture. this is an important consideration for the RP studies, in which the BHK-RPs had 39-fold greater E:GE ratios compared to C6/36-RPs. however, we still observed greater spread with BHK-WNV, which had only 10-fold greater E:GE ratio compared to C6/36-WNV. C57BL/6J mice were inoculated in the left rear footpad with 2x105 infectious units of C6/36-RPs, BHK-RPs, or diluent. results are from the same mice as shown in Fig 6, and each symbol represents a single mouse."}
