{"summary": "hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a syndrome that is characterized by an inappropriate hyper-inflammatory immune response. primary, as a consequence of a genetic defect of NK cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes or \u2013 secondary, in the progression of infections, rheumatic or autoimmune diseases. male patient splenectomized for spherocytosis since age of 4. no prophylaxis of meningococcal, and pneumococcal infections through vaccination. at the time of admission, the following changes were noticed. blood cultures and urine cultures were positive for S pneumoniae. resistant to benzylpenicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, cefotaxime, and intermediate resistance to ceftriaxone, imipenem. viral, parasitic etiologies excluded, as well as malignant tumors. id 2 600 mg/day, followed with linezolid associated with moxifloxacin 400 mg/m2/day, 3 days, anidulafungin, intravenous immunoglobulin, and daily hemodialysis sessions throughout hospitalization. the evolution was unfavorable with coma, Glasgow Coma Scale of 3, and quadriplegia, the occurrence of bronchopneumonia required endotracheal intubation. splenectomised patients develop severe systemic infections with encapsulated bacteria. lack of vaccination has enabled the development of severe infections with multidrug-resistant S pneumoniae. secondary HLH may be induced by viral (29%), bacterial, or parasitic infections (20%), autoimmune or rheumatic diseases (7%), cancers (27%), and metabolic diseases or immunodeficiency syndromes (6%). the most frequently described parasitic causes responsible for secondary HLH are: leishmania sp, [33,34] malaria,[35\u201337] and toxoplasma gondii. fever, splenomegaly, cytopenia (on at least 2 lines in peripheral blood), hypofibrinemia, hyperferritinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, presence of hemophagocytosis in bone marrow or lymph node, reduction/absence of two cases of HLH associated with a pneumococcal infection had been published. splenectomy is described as a therapeutic method in refractory HLH cases. splenectomy is described as a therapeutic method in refractory HLH cases. ococcal infection in a splenectomized patient for spherocytosis is surprizing. other similar observations are necessary in the future."}
