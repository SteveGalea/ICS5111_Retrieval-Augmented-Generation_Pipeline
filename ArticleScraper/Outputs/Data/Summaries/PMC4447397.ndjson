{"summary": "Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a highly pathogenic arthropod-borne virus that has a detrimental effect on both livestock and human populations. many diagnostic methodologies are not sensitive enough to diagnose early infections. detection may be hindered by high abundant proteins such as albumin. zoonotic virus is a zoonotic virus belonging to the genus Phlebovirus within the family Bunyaviridae. it is transmitted to a wide range of vertebrate hosts via mosquitoes and other arthropod vectors. symptoms in humans are usually mild and resemble a flu-like illness. nanotrap particles are hydrogel particles of various sizes. nanotrap particles are functionalized with charge-based affinity baits. the baits serve to further capture, concentrate, and trap targets proteins. nanotrap particles increase sensitivity by performing three important functions. a 2014 paper by Jaworski et al. showed nanotrap particles can be used to capture both HIV-1 virions as well as various viral proteins such as Tat and Nef in clinically relevant matrices. nanotrap particles can improve sensitivity more than 100-fold over existing methods. the virus was generated by 12 serial passages in MRC5 cells. his-tagged nucleoprotein was produced in house or obtained from Immune Technology. an agar plate containing Ampicillin was streaked with E. coli stock. samples were centrifuged at 10,000\u201314,000 rpm for 30 minutes. pellets were washed one time with 0.25 M sodium thiocyanate and two times with RNase- and DNase-free water. five milliliters of viral supernatant were added to the concentrators and centrifuged for 7 minutes at 1400 rpm. both top and bottom portions, as well as control samples that were not run through the concentrator, were saved for downstream analysis. nanotrap samples were boiled for 10 min and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm. supernatants were separated on Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to PVDF membranes. membranes were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS +0.1% Tween-20 (PBS-T) for 1 hour at room temperature. coomassie gel NP was eluted from the Nanotrap pellets as described above. the gel was covered with Coomassie stain (0.5 g Coomassie Blue R, 800 ml methanol, 140 ml acetic acid, brought up to 2 L with diH2O), microwaved until gently boiling, then rocked for 1 hour at room temperature. l of the sample incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. both the control and-NT samples were boiled and centrifuged in parallel with +NT samples. cell culture Vero cells were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium. the bacterial pellet was shaken for an additional 4 hours followed by centrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 20 minutes at 4\u00b0C. the bacterial pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, pH 8.0. pellets were washed one time with 0.25 M sodium thiocyanate and two times with RNase- and DNase-free water. the volume of sodium thiocyanate and water washes were equivalent to the volume of original sample used. the band analysis tools were used to determine the background-subtracted density of the NP bands in the western blots. the percent of total NP was determined by dividing the top or bottom portion's band density by the total NP band density. 13 and EC22 primary antibodies were reused for several experiments without the addition of extra antibody. the membranes were then washed 3 times with PBS-T and incubated with secondary HRP-coupled goat anti-rabbit (for anti-His antibody) or anti-mouse (for EC13 antibody) antibody diluted 1:1,000 in 3% BSA for 2 hours and then washed 4 times with PBS-T for 5 minutes. fected with RVFV MP12 at an MOI of 3 and collected after 24 hours. non-virion associated NP can be detected in viral supernatants Nucleoprotein (NP) is the most abundant viral protein of RVFV. supernatants were separated using a centrifugal concentrator with a molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) of 300 kDa. higher amounts of NP protein were detected in the concentrated supernatant (top portion) due to their size, intact RVFV virions would be retained in the concentrated supernatant (top portion) five milliliters of viral supernatant was added to the concentrators and centrifuged at 1400 rpm for 7 minutes until approximately 500 l remained on the top portion of the concentrator. western blot analyzed the top (T) and bottom (B) fractions, as well as control sample (C) containing the original sample before processing. NT45, NT53, and NT69 were the best performers with purified recombinant RVFV NP. NT45 was the best performer in enrichment of the protein at a higher volume. NP was only faintly detectable without nanotrap particles at 1E+06 pfu/ml. the sample is then centrifuged and unbound supernatant is loaded onto an SDS PAGE gel. the samples were centrifuged at maximum speed and the supernatants were then analyzed. control\u2014NT sample (10 l volume) was processed in parallel. samples were processed as described in panel A. NT45-incubated samples were able to detect the protein down to the lowest concentration tested. the NP was detectable without Nanotrap particles at 15 g/ml and 7.5 g/ml. the protein was undetectable at the lower protein concentrations. the nanotrap particles can enrich NP from virally infected cells. no nanotrap particles were processed in parallel. the control sample is CE at 770 g/ml (10 l volume) the samples were processed as in panel A. nanotrap particles can capture and enrich NP from viral supernatants. supernatants from mock infected or MP12 infected (MOI 0.1, 1, or 10) vero cells were collected at 24, 16, and 24 hours post infection. the samples were processed as in panel A. the control sample is viral supernatant at 1E+07 pfu/ml (10 l volume) the samples were processed as in panel A. NT45, not NT104, was the best candidate in serum capture. results suggest that the outer shell of NT104 may interfere with capture of the dimeric form of the NP. NT45 was greatly enriched in goat serum, with a 6- and 12-fold increase in band density. nanotrap particles can capture and enrich NP found in various animal sera. no nanotrap particle (-NT) and control (CE at 77.7 g/ml diluted in 50mM Tris-HCl) samples at 10 l volumes were processed in parallel. control sample is viral supernatant at 1E+07 pfu/ml (10 l volume) samples were processed as described in panel A. nanotrap particles can protect NP from degradation at increased temperatures. NP in the absence of nanotrap particles was virtually undetectable starting at 24 hours. over time there was no NP degradation in the presence of NT45. nanotrap particles can protect NP from degradation at increased temperatures and times. a paper published by Liu et al. showed that a substantial amount of NP could be purified from the media of infected Sf9 cells. this suggests that this protein may be released independently of the other viral proteins. NP can be used as an important biomarker in detecting RVFV infections. a detectable amount of NP (approximately 20%) was still present in the filtrate. the filter had a greater amount of non-virion associated NP available for potential capture. purified recombinant his-NP was incubated with seven different Nanotrap particles. NT45, NT53, and NT69 were the best performers with purified NP. NP was only faintly detectable without nanotrap particles at 1E+06 pfu/ml. nanotrap particles are incubated with samples for 30 minutes at room temperature. the pellet is resuspended in lysis buffer and boiled for 10 minutes. the sample is then centrifuged and unbound supernatant is loaded onto an SDS PAGE gel. no nanotrap particle samples (-NT) at a 10 l volume of 0.4 mg/ml were processed in parallel. a control\u2014NT sample (10 l volume) was processed in parallel. we incubated the three Nanotrap particles with cytoplasmic extracts (CE) obtained from RVFV infected vero lysates. results showed that all three nanotrap particles were capable of capturing and concentrating NP from a larger volume of 1 ml. trap particle sample (-NT) was processed in parallel after 30 minutes. the bound material (P) from the spin was saved and 10 l was processed in parallel. the samples were centrifuged at maximum speed and the supernatants were loaded onto a nuPage 4\u201312% Bis-Tris gel. NP was virtually undetectable in control samples containing no Nanotrap particles. a clear band was detected at 100 l of sample with band intensity increasing. a 12.6-fold increase in band density at the 1 ml sample volume compared to the no NT sample. supernatants from mock infected or MP12 infected (MOI 10) cells were collected at 8, 16, and 24 hours post infection. a volume of 100 l, 500 l, and 1000 l were incubated with 100 l NT45 for 30 minutes. the samples were processed as in panel A. NT45 was the best candidate in serum capture, resulting in a 20-fold increase in band density for NT45 and a 13-fold increase in band density for NT104 compared to the no NT sample. this results suggest that the outer shell of NT104 may interfere with capture of the dimeric form of the NP. NT45, not NT104, was the best candidate in serum capture. cibacron blue bait and an outer shell were the best Nanotrap particle for capture of RVFV virions. we incubated our sample with equal parts NT45 and NT53. NT45 was also capable of capturing RVFV virions at various viral concentrations. no nanotrap particle (-NT) and control (CE at 7.7 g/ml diluted in 50mM Tris-HCl) samples at 10 l volumes were processed in parallel. the samples were processed as described in panel A. the samples incubated with NT45 remained stable from 24 to 120 hours. in the absence of nanotrap particles, NP was virtually undetectable starting at 24 hours. nanotrap particles are temperature-sensitive, decreasing in size with increased temperature. nanotrap particles can be used as a sample preparation tool to concentrate NP that is commonly used for RVFV diagnostics. the nanotrap particles can be concentrated from a large starting volume of sample into a small volume from clinically relevant matrices. the structure of the dyes mimics the structure of substrates that bind to the active sites of different proteins. NT45 is one core particle that is coupled to two different dyes. cibacron blue has been described as a \"universal pseudoaffinity ligand\" western blot results suggest a 100-fold increase in NP detection after nanotrap particle incubation at low viral titers that would have normally rendered a false-negative result. the nanotrap particles can capture and enrich RVFV NP in the presence of abundant resident proteins that are found in serum. nanotrap particles are compatible with ELISAs. the promiscuity of the nanotrap particles allows for enrichment of host and viral antigens from a single sample. the nanotrap particles also serve as an important tool for host biomarker discovery. a recent paper successfully used nanotrap particles to compare IL8 concentrations in mock-infected and MP12-infected samples. these findings suggest that nanotrap particles can be used to analyze the alterations of host genes after RVFV infection in a more sensitive manner."}
