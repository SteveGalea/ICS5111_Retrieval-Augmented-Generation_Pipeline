{"summary": "Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV) are closely related highly pathogenic zoonoses and are the type species within the paramyxovirus genus Henipavirus. both viruses can cause significant morbidity and mortality in a variety of vertebrate species including humans. henipaviruses are categorized as zoonotic biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) agents. the henipaviruses are distinguished from all other paramyxoviruses by their unusually broad host tropism. they require two membrane-anchored envelope glycoproteins; the attachment (G) glycoprotein which binds the viral receptor, and the fusion (F) glycoprotein which drives virus-host cell membrane merger [11]. there are currently no licensed therapeutics available to treat infection caused by the henipaviruses. ferrets have emerged as a model for several viral respiratory diseases including avian influenza [23], severe acute respiratory syndrome [24] and morbilliviruses [25], close relatives of henipaviruses [26]. ferrets have emerged as a model for several viral respiratory diseases including avian influenza [23], severe acute respiratory syndrome [24] and morbilliviruses [25]. doses of 50, 500, 5,000 or 50,000 TCID50 were each administered to groups of two ferrets oral-nasally; the most likely route of natural infection. endpoints were fever plus signs of rapidly progressing clinical illness including both generalized (e.g. inappetance, depression) and localizing. chymoses (6\u20135000); severe depression, vomiting and hypothermia (5\u20135000); and obtunded with tremor and hind limb paresis (4\u2013500). histopathology of diseased ferrets revealed acute focal necrotizing alveolitis and pulmonary vasculitis, acute glomerular necrosis, focal necrosis of the spleen, and severe diffuse subacute inflammation of the organs and connective tissues. ferret 7\u201350000, lung tissue with severe acute necrotizing alveolitis and vasculitis. antigen present in syncytia (long arrow) and blood vessel wall (short arrow) ferret 4\u2013500, antigen staining in arachnoid membrane of the meninges. viral RNA was recovered in pharyngeal and rectal swabs 9 dpi. notably, NiV RNA was not detected in any tissues from clinically healthy ferrets. for all other animals with clinical signs, significant levels of viral RNA were detected in adrenal, kidney, lung, bronchial lymph node and spleen tissues. the presence of infectious virus is indicated by the (+) above individual data bars. the presence of infectious virus is indicated by the (+) above individual data bars. a hmAb, m102.4, can neutralize HeV and NiV in vitro. one ferret in the post-challenge group (28-post) was given m102.4 intraperitoneally. control ferrets were challenged oral-nasally with a 5,000 TCID50 dose of NiV. by 8 dpi the controls were severely depressed, had subcutaneous edema of the head and cutaneous hemorrhages and they were euthanized. all surviving animals were euthanized for completion (20 dpi) all surviving animals were euthanized for completion (20 dpi) in ferrets 23-pre and 24-pre, NiV antigen was present in ependymal tissue. post + x/- - 27-post + +/ x - x - 10 23-pre + +/ x - x - x - + -nasal discharge 21-pre - - 26-post + x/- - 27-post + - - - -sneezing 28-post - - 13 23-pre + + + x/- - - -diarrhea ferret 21-pre, the only animal to survive in the pre-challenge group, had detectable levels of viral RNA in the blood 3 dpi. by 13 dpi, viral RNA levels in ferrets 23-pre and 24-pre were similar to those found in controls. all treated ferrets (except 21-pre) had significant amounts of systemic and mucosal NiV for at least 10 dpi. controls and the two diseased pre-group ferrets had similar high levels of viral RNA in all tissues. virology was attempted on all samples with detectable NiV RNA. ferret 21-pre had the highest levels of serum m102.4 pre-challenge. by 3 dpi, all pre-challenge group ferrets had significantly lower m102.4 concentrations compared to the post-challenge group. m102.4 concentrations in all animals had dropped and were the lowest among the post-challenge group. Ferret 21-pre had high levels of G-specific antibodies 10 dpi. by 13 dpi, NiV-G specific antibody responses had increased further in all ferrets with the highest levels found in 27-post and 28-post ferrets. m102.4 is a potent neutralizing human monoclonal antibody. it involves binding a single epitope within the receptor binding domain of the henipavirus G glycoprotein and affectively blocking receptor engagement and virus infection. no virus was isolated from tissues when m102.4 was present. dlands was completely neutralized at 1.25 g/ml m102.4. all other isolates were even more sensitive with complete neutralization occurring at 0.63 g/ml m102.4. m102.4 is a post-exposure therapeutic option for henipavirus-infected individuals. doses of 50, 500, 5,000 or 50,000 TCID50 were each administered to groups of two ferrets oral-nasally; the most likely route of natural infection. based on prior experience with NiV infection in cats [22],[27],[28] and using similar parameters, we defined infection endpoints in ferrets for the purpose of humane euthanasia. severe depression, vomiting and hypothermia (5\u20135000); and obtunded with tremor and hind limb paresis (4\u2013500). varying degrees of subcutaneous hemorrhagic edema of the head and neck centered upon local lymph nodes in all diseased ferrets. focal raised pin-head hemorrhagic nodules scattered throughout the pulmonary parenchyma; scattered intra-abdominal petechial hemor ferret 7\u201350000, lung tissue with severe acute necrotizing alveolitis and vasculitis. antigen present in syncytia (long arrow) and blood vessel wall (short arrow) ferret 4\u2013500, antigen staining in arachnoid membrane of the meninges. viral RNA was recovered in pharyngeal and rectal swabs 9 dpi. notably, NiV RNA was not detected in any tissues. for all other animals with clinical signs, significant levels of viral RNA were detected in adrenal, kidney, lung, bronchial lymph node and spleen tissues. for tissue samples with relative NiV N gene expression above 10 virus isolation was performed on duplicate samples. the presence of infectious virus is indicated by the (+) above individual data bars. real-time PCR can help discern virus distribution in an infected animal. one ferret in the post-challenge group (28-post) was given m102.4 intraperitoneally. control ferrets (22-con and 25-con) were challenged oral-nasally with a 5,000 TCID50 dose of NiV. by 8 dpi the controls were severely depressed, had subcutaneous edema of the head and cutaneous hemorrhages and they were euthanized. all surviving animals were euthanized for the controls and two ferrets in the pre-challenge group that succumbed to infection. gross and microscopic pathology revealed findings similar to those described in the MID50 study. however, in ferrets 23-pre and 24-pre the frequency of pinpoint hemorrhagic lesions was reduced and lesions were much smaller suggesting the disease progression in the respiratory tract had been dampened. ferret 28-post, m102.4 was administered intraperitoneally. no signs of illness, disease or lesions: healthy ferret lungs. ferret 21-pre, the only animal to survive in the pre-challenge group, had detectable levels of viral RNA in the blood 3 dpi. by 13 dpi, viral RNA levels in ferrets 23-pre and 24-pre were similar to those found in controls. all treated ferrets (except 21-pre) had significant amounts of systemic and mucosal NiV for at least 10 dpi. controls and the two diseased pre-group ferrets had similar high levels of viral RNA in all tissues. virology was attempted on all samples with detectable NiV RNA. ferret 21-pre had the highest levels of serum m102.4 pre-challenge. by 3 dpi, all pre-challenge group ferrets had significantly lower m102.4 concentrations compared to the post-challenge group. m102.4 concentrations in all animals had dropped and were the lowest among the post-challenge group. ferret 21-pre had high levels of G-specific antibodies 10 dpi. by 13 dpi, NiV-G specific antibody responses had increased further in all ferrets. blood was collected at various time points post-challenge. m102.4 is a potent neutralizing human monoclonal antibody. it involves binding a single epitope within the receptor binding domain of the henipavirus G glycoprotein and affectively blocking receptor engagement and virus infection. no virus was isolated from tissues when m102.4 was present. ferret model is unique and exhibits both severe respiratory and neurological disease, and generalized vasculitis. the ferret model is unique and exhibits both severe respiratory and neurological disease, and generalized vasculitis. a more widespread infection in the CNS would have developed if animals were allowed to succumb to disease without euthanasia. we speculate that a more widespread infection in the CNS would have developed if animals were allowed to succumb to disease without euthanasia. m102.4 concentrations in the pre-group may not have been sufficient to neutralize all virus, allowing the initiation of infection. in the post-challenge group, the host immune system may have had an opportunity (10 hrs) to initiate a primary response before antibody-mediated depletion of virus. m102.4 has confirmed its potent cross-reactive neutralization activity against the NiV-Malaysia [33], the original HeV-1994 [34], the recent HeV-Redlands [5] and NiV-Bangladesh isolates [35]. it will also be critical to increase the number of animals studied and further explore the therapeutic window post-challenge. atimepazole (Antisedan; Novartis, Pendle Hill, AU) was given intramuscularly at 50% the dose of medetomidine. ferrets were assessed daily and scored out of 10 for a range of clinical observations. real-time monitoring of body temperature was done using transponders implanted subcutaneously. two ferrets received PBS, one at 24 hours before challenge and the other at 10 hours after challenge. animals were allowed to recover from the anaesthesia. RNA isolation RNA was purified from blood cells using the RiboPure-Blood kit (Ambion Inc.), from swabs using the QIAamp viral RNA kit (Qiagen Pty Ltd) samples were homogenized for 2 cycles of 30 sec using a mini-Bead Beater (Biospec Products Inc.) samples were amplified in a GeneAmp 7500 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City eight adult ferrets were used for the in vivo m102.4 efficacy study. all animal studies were endorsed by the CSIRO, AAHL, Animal Ethics Committee. ferrets were fed twice daily with a complete premium dry food. for the MID50 study all ferrets were challenged with 5103 TCID50. m102.4 was administered via catheter by slow infusion over 4 minutes to 6 ferrets. animals were allowed to recover from the anaesthesia. tissue samples were collected aseptically from lung (apical and diaphragmatic lobes), brain (olfactory and occipital lobes), heart, bronchial lymph nodes, spleen, liver, kidney, bladder, and adrenal gland. in females, the uterine horn and ovaries were collected and in males the testes were collected. histopathology and immunohistochemistry Tissues were processed by routine histological methods. sections of tissue were stained with hematoxylin and eosin to examine histopathological changes."}
