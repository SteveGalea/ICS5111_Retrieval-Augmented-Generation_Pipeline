{"summary": "the HIV epidemic has been concentrated in most at-risk populations (MARPs) including injection drug users, commercial sex workers (CSWs) and their clients, men who have sex with men (MSM) and former plasma donors. in some geographic areas HIV prevalence is >1% in the general population. the world health organization (WHO) was the earliest international organization to assist China. the first large international project was one million USD from the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) for training in Yunnan province. the program plays a significant role in improving the effectiveness of national and provincial programmes and piloting innovative methods. the China\u2013Australia AIDS Project, funded by AusAID, advocates for harm reduction strategies has greatly influenced China\u2019s policy towards harm reduction. the Merck Foundation works in Sichuan province to understand the local epidemics and support prevention and treatment (www.merck.com) CARES was launched in 2004 by the central government to improve HIV/AIDS treatment and care. china explored models of HIV/AIDS prevention and control using techniques and concepts introduced through international cooperation projects. as China\u2019s HIV/AIDS epidemic became localized in high-prevalence areas, China\u2019s comprehensive HIV/AIDS prevention and control work expanded significantly. the world bank supported the health IX project in China for HIV testing and screening laboratory network capacity construction. the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM) Rounds 3, 4, 5 and 6 china AIDS Projects jointly supported HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, care and support activities covered more than 20 provinces in China. the contributions from the Global Fund will total >400 million USD (www.theglobalfund.org) new concepts and strategies have been put into effect in several areas. the effects of international cooperation have allowed China to reach a level where China is taking on a more active role in supplying international aid for their own HIV/AIDS response. international projects have reduced the shortage of financial and technical support in Yunnan. they have achieved remarkable success advocating for policy change, building capacity, establishing interventions, conducting surveillance, testing MARPs and providing anti-retroviral treatment. several interventions, including condom promotion, STD clinic-based outreach and intervention among low-fee sex workers and clients, have all been developed and are still improving. these methods have been adopted as national guidelines for HIV/AIDS control and were scaled-up throughout the country. china has increased the number of government agencies collaborating on the response to AIDS. these agencies have adopted policies emphasizing transparency and open sharing of data. the involvement of international cooperation makes the various levels of government more serious about HIV prevention. international cooperation projects create a team of HIV/AIDS fighters. they have become the main force in fighting AIDS in china. programmes support applied research in HIV/AIDS prevention and control. domestic CBOs are continually developing, growing and contributing to domestic HIV/AIDS prevention and control work. there were 357 CBOs registered to participate in the GFATM China Country Coordinating Mechanism development in 2009. the implementation of international cooperation projects has established a platform of communication and cooperation between China and other countries. cooperation projects have provided continuous support for the development of laboratory equipment, training, technical assistance, management capacity to the national AIDS Reference Laboratory. from 2005 to 2008, 11.8 million USD was provided for their activities, including training and prevention interventions. the total RCC budget is 510 million USD, with 59.5 million USD approved in 2010. in 2000, china initiated a voluntary counselling and testing pilot programme. based on the experiences of the pilot programme, VCT became a national strategy in 2004. the surveillance strategy has also changed from serology to behavioural surveillance. the first government-initiated intervention programme for MSM was conducted in Yunnan and Sichuan provinces under the support of the China\u2013UK AIDS program. several innovative intervention activities were conducted with the cooperation of the MSM community, including hotlines, face-to-face counselling, theme parties, internet-based education and peer education. china\u2019s comprehensive response mechanism was created one step at a time. top national leaders have visited AIDS patients, supervised HIV prevention work and encouraged health workers during the annual World AIDS Day activities. this has set a good example for the whole society to follow. the first Rural HIV/AIDS Clinical Training Centre was established in anhui province. the centre has trained more than 100 village doctors on HIV/AIDS treatment. the china Integrated Program for Research on AIDS (CIPRA) has pursued research in behavioural interventions, viral immunity, clinical management and vaccine research through research projects in China. the research project has generated 101 articles published in peer-reviewed journals. in recent years, more and more international cooperation projects have provided funding for CBOs to participate in HIV/AIDS-related activities. this support has promoted CBO enthusiasm, but is far from enough to meet the needs. by improving the legal environment, China will further promote dialogue and mutual understanding between the government and grassroots organizations."}
