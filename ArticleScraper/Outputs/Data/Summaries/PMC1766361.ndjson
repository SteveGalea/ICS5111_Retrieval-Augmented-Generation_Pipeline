{"summary": "mycoplasma alkalescens is a bovine mycoplasma, which was originally isolated from cattle in australia. it has been isolated from bulk tank milk samples, as well as from outbreaks and sporadic cases of clinical mastitis in cattle. it has been isolated from cases of severe arthritis, and its ability to induce joint lesions has been confirmed under experimental conditions. Isolation of mycoplasmas was performed using a Hayflick's type of medium enriched with arginine [13] with and without addition of 5% of rabbit hyperimmune antiserum against Mycoplasma bovirhinis. the isolates were filtered through 0.45 m membrane filters (Millipore) and submitted to serologic identification. arginin-metabolizing mycoplasmas were found once in combination with P. multocida and once in combination with M. haemolytica. no viral pathogens were detected in any of the analysed samples. all eight isolates could be serologically identified as M. alkalescens. plasma strains DGIa IFb DGIa IFb M. alkalescens PG51T 5 + 0 - 0\" Field strain MK19/02 3 + 0 - 0 - Field strain MK49/02* 3 + 0 - 0 - Field strain MK52/02* 3 + 0 - 0 - Field strain MK53/02* 3 + 0 - 0 - Field strain MK56/02 experimental infections have demonstrated that M. alkalescens has the ability to colonize lung tissue [18] but the two strains used in the study apparently failed to produce pneumonia [18] this finding is not sufficient to warrant a role of M. alkalescens as a cause of bronchopneumonia, since two samples containing only a non-pathogenic M. bovirhinis. mycoplasma bovigenitalium and M. canadense have been isolated only from the respiratory and the genital tract and semen samples. further investigations are needed to determine the prevalence of M. alkalescens in the Danish cattle population. authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
