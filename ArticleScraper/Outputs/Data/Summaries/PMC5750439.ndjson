{"summary": "scientists and the media tend to focus exclusively on the biological effects of such infectious diseases and rarely stop to examine the psychic havoc these epidemics leave in their wake. from 2013 to 2016, the West African Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic galvanized physical, human, and financial resources to sequester mortality and morbidity. radic infectious diseases have associations with various neuropsychiatric disorders. for example, Borna virus has some human associations with neuropsychiatric disease. bacterial agents have been shown to increase the risk of mental illness. a human comes in contact with the bodily fluids of a patient with active symptoms or who has died from EVD. symptoms include abrupt onset of fever, chills, low-grade fever, malaise, diffuse erythematous, nonpruritic maculopapular rash developing 5\u20137 days postinfection. the last transmission of EVD from 2013 to 2016 occurred 42 days prior. there are 28,610 confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of EVD. EVD can cause vulnerabilities, social stigma, distress, and isolation at an individual level. individuals may experience fear, isolation, and suffering during or after an infectious disease epidemic. the new plague, Zika, has less research that explores its natural clinical progression. it causes congenital microcephaly, maculopapular pruritic rash, arthralgia and conjunctivitis. there are currently no psychological signs or symptom. researchers point to the need for longitudinal cohorts of newborns in epidemic areas that evaluate neurodevelopment milestones. this allows for the assessment of the virus's impact on \"neuronal migration, organization, and myelination.(that could lead to),\" major (e.g., lissencephaly and schizencephaly) and minor (e.g., focal dysplasias) brain malformations and \"functional\" neuropsychiatric syndromes. over 800,000 people die from suicide per year globally. this figure is almost three times greater than the overall EVD epidemic mortality. suicides related to EVD are most likely underreported. the CDC says risk factors for suicide include local epidemics of suicide, isolation, loss, physical illness, and barriers to accessing mental health treatment. there is a continued need to expand health-care spending in the us and globally, not only on future infectious disease epidemics but also on the overlooked epidemic of mental health illness. a person presenting to the ED with signs and symptoms of Zika or Ebola virus should be asked about social support, family ties, any recent deaths, especially due the virus. psychiatric screening could be used alongside other modalities (e.g., laboratory tests and imaging) as a screening tool in ED's. emergency physicians can continue to advocate for funding to research these viruses and increase access and responsiveness to detect and treat these diseases. these emerging infectious diseases outbreaks need to address the mental health emergencies of patients through increased funding, awareness, and research."}
