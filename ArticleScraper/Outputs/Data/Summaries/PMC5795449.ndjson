{"summary": "cellular metabolism is a fundamental and complex biological phenomenon. it consists of two opposite and entwined processes, catabolism that breaks down macromolecules to produce energy in the form of ATP. and anabolism that delivers nutrients such as carbohydrates, amino acids and fatty acids for macromolecular synthesis. glycolysis allows immune cells to adapt, survive and acquire effector functions when under metabolically limited conditions during infection or hypoxia. the results have revealed three core metabolic pathways: glycolysis, fatty acid synthesis and glutaminolysis that are commonly altered by almost all viruses using distinct mechanisms to facilitate discrete steps of viral propagation. pyruvate enters mitochondria where it is oxidized into acetyl coenzyme A. coA feeds the tricarboxylic (TCA) cycle and drives the electron transport chain to generate ATP from adenosine diphosphate. once completely metabolized into carbon dioxide through the TCA cycle, one glucose can generate 36 ATP equivalents. glucose is taken up by specific transporters, where it is converted to pyruvate in the cytoplasm, generating two ATP molecules (glycolysis) in the presence of oxygen, pyruvate is transported into the mitochondria and oxidized into acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) which enters the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. further details are outlined in the text. diverse antiviral mechanisms by interferons and their Stimulated Genes (IFNs) were discovered over half a century ago because of their strong antiviral activity against influenza virus. some ISGs directly target and impair specific steps of viral replication. some ISGs target and impair specific steps of viral replication. a group of ISGs inhibit the translation of viral RNA, thus halt viral replication. these ISGs include PKR (protein kinase R), 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS), IFIT1, ZAP (zinc finger antiviral protein), SLFN11 and others. the antiviral ISG Cholesterol-25-hydroxylase (CH25H) encodes an enzyme which converts cholesterol to the soluble oxysterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC). 25-HC may do so by repressing SREBP2 activation and/or by enhancing the expression of microRNA miR-185 that regulates hepatic lipid homeostasis. 25-HC inhibits multiple enveloped viruses, including HIV-1 [38,41], HCV (42), vesicular stomatitis virus (42), vesicular stomatitis virus (42), SFTS virus (43), WNV (44), dengue virus (44), Zika virus (ZIKV) and, interestingly, Pseudorabies virus (PRV) in pigs [45]. 25-HC inhibits the formation of a membranous web (HCV replication site) on intracellular membranes. the second mechanism for the antiviral action of 25-HC works by post-translational modifications (PTMs) 25-HC inhibits GP1 glycosylation, leading to the incorporation of aberrantly glycosylated GP1 into LASV particles. the precise mechanism by which 25-HC induces these changes has yet to be elucidated. IFNs deplete polyamines as a Strategy to check Viral Infection Polyamines have been long known to promote the replication of many DNA viruses and RNA viruses yet. polyamines are ubiquitous, small, positively charged biogenic molecules essential for promoting cell growth and differentiation [64], mediating apoptosis [65]. difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) is an irreversible inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase. it is estimated that 80% of polyamines are associated with cellular RNA. a large number of RNA viruses are also dependent on polyamines for replication. depletion of polyamines using difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) significantly suppresses sindbis virus (SINV) infection of Drosophila melanogaster and zebrafish Danio rerio. HCMV, adenovirus, and vaccinia virus enhance the activity of ODC1 which catalyses the conversion of ornithine to putrescine. DFMO, an irreversible inhibitor of ODC, has recently attracted interest for the treatment of neuroblastoma [80,81]. DFMO is a stable and well-tolerated drug with mild side-effects in humans and can be administered via several routes. tryptophan is metabolized by the serotonin and kynurenine pathway. IFN-induced IDO1 gene expression decreases tryptophan availability for viral replication as well as reducing melatonin/serotonin synthesis and T cell proliferation. 1 was identified for its strong anti-HIV-2 activity [30]. the study subsequently confirmed that production of both HIV-1 and HIV-2 was substantially curtailed by IDO1. the significant role of IDO1 in IFN-mediated strong inhibition of HIV-1 production was demonstrated by the 10-fold rescue of HIV-1 yield in A549 or TZM-bl cells. primary macrophages and mouse lungs infected with IAV showed IFN-mediated upregulation of IDO1. this activity was attenuated by the IAV NS1 protein through suppressing interferon production. another important aspect to consider is the role of the serotonin pathway during infection. pleen or brain despite substantial depletion in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tryptophan depletion is not a primary contributor to T-cell impairment during HIV/SIV infection. the sterile alpha motif and histidine-aspartate domain containing protein 1 (SAMHD1) inhibits the DNA synthesis of HIV-1, murine leukaemia virus (MLV), human T cell leukemia virus type 1, vaccinia virus, and HSV-1. the gene was first identified in human dendritic cells as an ortholog of the mouse gene, Mg11 induced by interferon- upon viral infection [121]. dNTP hydrolase regulates intracellular dNTP levels by catalysing the conversion of deoxynucleoside triphosphates to deoxynucleoside and inorganic triphosphate. dNTP hydrolase regulates intracellular dNTP levels by catalysing the conversion of deoxynucleoside triphosphates to deoxynucleoside triphosphate. the activity of SAMHD1 has been subject to modulation by both cellular and viral mechanisms. first, the expression level of SAMHD1 is cell cycle dependent [135,136] to warrant sufficient dNTP levels to support cellular DNA duplication at the S phase. phosphorylate T592 of SAMHD1 prevents SAMHD1 from depleting dNTPs [136]. ral therapy: a novel therapeutic approach Viral infections remain a significant challenge to human health, ranging from seasonal outbreaks of influenza affecting 20% of the global population to recent outbreaks of Zika virus, Dengue virus, Ebola virus and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus. there is a clear need to develop new drugs and find novel therapeutic targets against viral infections. a prime example is the IAV. reversing the metabolic changes caused by viruses may serve as an attractive therapeutic strategy to control viral infection. fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis are enhanced upon viral infection to support the generation of new viral progenies. studies have shown activated AMPK can restrict a number of RNA viruses including, RVFV, Bunyavirus, SINV and VSV. inhibition of AMPK significantly enhances KSHV lytic replication. studies conducted using aICAR to treat type II diabetes have shown promise. mutations in nsp1 and arginine conferred no resistance to polyamine depletion. in vitro and in vivo studies revealed combinations of mutations enhanced CHIKV replication and fitness. innate immune response plays a pivotal role in responding to these viral changes in effort to warrant cell survival. a limited number of ISGs have been reported to modulate cellular metabolism. the role of IFNs and ISGs in immunometabolism and regulating carbon metabolism has opened novel avenues for viral therapy."}
