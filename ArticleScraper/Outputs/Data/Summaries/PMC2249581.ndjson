{"summary": "a disease surveillance team was organized to establish a hospital emergency department-based syndromic surveillance system (ED-SSS) the system automatically transmits patient data electronically from the hospitals responsible for emergency care throughout the country to the centers for disease control in Taiwan starting March, 2004. this report describes the challenges and steps involved in developing ED-SSS. government health officials in sARS-affected countries have begun to consider various measures of improving their infectious disease surveillance systems. the task force and the RODS group aimed to establish a nationwide syndromic surveillance system within six months to meet the challenges of potential avian flu outbreaks for up-coming winter seasons. the ED-SSS has been in operation since march, 2004. it is the first time in Taiwan that information technology and timely data directly from hospitals has been used with systematic approaches to facilitate public health surveillance. the illance system (ED-SSS) in Taiwan was established in 2003. the information included time and date of admission, date of birth, gender, home zip-code, body temperature, triage categories and chief complaints for patients admitted to their EDs. ED-SSS is capable of accepting these data of above-mentioned variables in either format. 189 hospitals recruited into our system had independent MySQL servers on which their data were saved. data files generated by the 189 hospitals, including data from their triage classification systems, hospital information systems (HIS) and clinical information systems (CIS) were firstly de-ident and then transferred hourly to a Microsoft SQL Server 2000 at the Taiwan-CDC. data was collected from each hospital on consecutive days. the system was capable of performing rapid and rapid checks of any subject of hospital identification code. the system was capable of moving erroneous data to an \"error table\" for storage. ICD-9 codes for enterovirus-related infection syndrome group ICD9 Codes ICD9 Description 074 Specific diseases due to Coxsackie virus 079.2 Coxsackie virus: Viral and chlamydial infection in conditions classified elsewhere and of unspecified site 047.0 Coxsackie virus: meningitis 074.0 Coxsackie pericarditis 074.22 Coxsackie endocarditis 074.23 Coxsackie myocardi data were organized using statistical programs to perform a descriptive analysis of the daily and weekly plots of different syndrome cases. to increase the sensitivity of this ED-SSS in monitoring regional patterns of these 11 syndrome groups, we categorized ED-SSS data by four different geographical areas (northern, central, southern and eastern Taiwan) data included time and date of admission, date of birth, gender, home zip-code, body temperature, triage categories and chief complaints for patients admitted to their EDs. the national health insurance requires hospitals to keep clinical data written in ICD-9 codes based on the criteria of the international classification of diseases. all the data of ED patients were de-identified before sending them to the Taiwan-CDC. 189 hospitals recruited into our system had independent MySQL servers on which their data were saved. a program was written into the system so that each transfer attempt would automatically generate an e-mail to the hospital notifying them whether the transfer had been successful. the system was capable of performing rapid and rapid checks of any subject of hospital identification code and time format of all time fields. the system was capable of moving erroneous data to an \"error table\" for storage. the system was capable of moving erroneous data to an \"error table\" for storage. 189 hospitals recruited into our system had independent MySQL servers on which their data were saved. data files generated by the 189 hospitals were firstly de-identified and then transferred hourly to a Microsoft SQL Server 2000 at the Taiwan-CDC. a program was written into the system so that each transfer attempt would generate an e-mail to the hospital notifying them whether the transfer had been successful or not. the system picks up the data from the first table every five minutes and moves it into a second temporary table for a logic check and data cleansing work. the cleaned-up data are transferred to the third table for further epidemiological analysis, aberration detection, and then sent to related local public health agencies. ted ICD-9-CM data were moved to the error table. all deletion and removal operations were recorded in the log file. the data examiner would contact the medical informatics officers of those specific hospitals. ICD9 Description 074 Specific diseases due to Coxsackie virus 079.2 Coxsackie virus: meningitis 074.0 Herpangina, Vesicular pharyngitis 074.1 Epidemic pleurodynia, Bornholm disease, Devil's grip; Epidemic: myalgia, myositis 074.2 Coxsackie carditis 074.20 Coxsackie carditis, unspecified 074.21 Cox 187 hospitals distributed across northern, central, eastern and southern Taiwan. 189 hospitals transmitting ED data in the required format to the CDC on a daily basis. the biggest challenge as began to develop the ED-SSS was communication with different hospitals. syndromic surveillance system should provide efficient feedback and effective two-way communication. 189 hospitals on 2,692,325 ED visits were collected and stored in the Taiwan-CDC database. the computer system shut down twice during this period, the first time occurred from august 8th to august 9th. system maintenance personnel need to check the log daily and make a phone call to the hospital to inform the personnel of health informatics about failure sending. only 5.04% of hospitals failed to send ICD-9-CM data, but almost half (47.4%) failed to send chief complaints. ED visits were 1.288-fold-higher on weekends than on weekdays. national holidays had significantly higher counts than weekends. most patients visiting ED were 60 years old or older. the ED-SSS was able to detect peaks of these respiratory-related syndromes even occurred in or around the summer season (July to September), though their most noticeable peaks were found during the Chinese new year holidays. the ED-SSS was able to detect peaks of these respiratory-related syndromes even occurred in or around the summer season. ED visits for respiratory syndrome peaked earlier (mid-September) than those for ILI (mid-October) and asthma syndrome (end of September, e.g. the transition period between summer and autumn). ED visits for pediatric asthma syndrome for children 12 years old and below peaked in mid-autumn, around mid-October. later during winter season there was an increase in all respiratory-infection related syndrome, particularly high during the Chinese New Year holidays. 187 hospitals distributed across northern, central, eastern and southern Taiwan. the ED-SSS had the cooperation of 187 hospitals distributed across northern, central, eastern and southern Taiwan. the biggest challenge as began to develop this system was communication with different hospitals. syndromic surveillance system should provide efficient feedback and effective two-way communication. the 189 hospitals on 2,692,325 ED visits were collected and stored in the Taiwan-CDC database. computer engineers cleaned the data by checking the log files and inform the hospitals by telephone on weekdays. program records all the logs of each data sending from the participating hospitals. if Taiwan-CDC doesn't receive data from hospitals, program will send e-mail automatically. system maintenance personnel need to check the log daily and make a phone call to the hospital to verify successful data transfer and quality of data. ED visits were 1.288-fold-higher on weekends than on weekdays. national holidays had significantly higher counts than weekends. most patients visiting ED were 60 years old or older or below the age of 10 years old (18.55%) number of ED Visits Percent of Total ED Visits (%) Proportion of Total Population in Taiwan, 2005 (%) 0\u20139 499,457 18.55% 11.63% 10\u201319 241,724 8.98% 14.06% 20\u201329 469,214 17.43% 16.98% 30\u201339 353,422 13.13% 16.04% 40\u201349 308,509 11.46% 16.40% 50\u201359 242,167 8.99% 11.73% 60\u201369 200,846 7. visits for pediatric asthma syndrome for children 12 years old and below peaked in mid-autumn, around mid-October. later during winter season there was an increase in all respiratory-infection related syndrome, particularly high during the Chinese New Year holidays. the ED-SSS found two clear, separate peaks for visits related to EVI, one for each of the two school semesters. Taiwan's ED-SSS is the first syndromic surveillance system to be implemented in Asia. it also represents the first time that Taiwan's public health agencies have attempted active nationwide surveillance. the information it provides can also be used as community baseline data for further infectious disease modeling. gastrointestinal syndrome starting late autumn 2004 has not been detected by other infectious disease surveillance systems in Taiwan. one reason for the increases might be related to the increased activity of certain pathogens, including rotavirus or norovirus, during winter season. the findings suggest further directions for research into GI syndrome and many other diseases of significant interest to public health. trends in coma/death and other syndrome groups of clinical severity or unexpected symptoms/signs. our ED-SSS data have provided directions for further research. future investigations have to control weekend and holiday effects of ED visits for better aberration detection even during long holidays. a standard format for select syndromes and variables needs to be established and continuously reevaluated to improve data quality and stability of data transmission. an ED-SSS like the one we developed in Taiwan may play an important role in detecting an outbreak possibly caused by human-to-human transmission. JSJW initiated the thoughts on Syndromic Surveillance for Emerging Infectious Disease in 2003. SWL worked on computer programming on ED-SSS and health informatics for surveillance systems of infectious disease at Taiwan-CDC. KCMC was a leader and coordinator on health informatics for surveillance systems of infectious diseases at Taiwan-CDC. initiated research on syndromic surveillance, coordinated each trouble-shooting step as the ED-SSS was developed and implemented. all authors read and approved the final manuscript."}
