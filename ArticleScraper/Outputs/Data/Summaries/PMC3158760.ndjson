{"summary": "IAVs cause seasonal influenza epidemics annually and recurring pandemics with severe consequences for public health and global economy. 1918 Spanish flu was the most serious influenza pandemic that killed over 50 million people worldwide. HA plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of IAVs. HA mediates IAVs' binding to the cellular receptor N-acetylneuraminic (sialic) acid. HA also stimulates host protective immunities. ELISA assays based on epitopes that are highly conserved and specific for one certain HA subtype will be useful for rapid and simple subtyping of IAVs. a set of 50 peptides with five residues overlapping with the adjacent peptides spanning the ectodomain sequences of the HA protein of the virus strain A/California/04/2009 were synthesized. five of these peptides (P3, P5, P15, P16 and P31) were found to react well with the sera tested. these peptides corresponded to sequences of amino acid residues 38\u201352, 58\u201372, 158\u2013172, 168\u2013182 and 318\u2013332 in the HA molecule. these peptides may contain H1N1pdm virus B cell epitopes. residues 58\u201373), P31 (red, residues 318\u2013332), P3 (blue, residues 38\u201352). HA monomer cartoon view is shown on the right and the same coloring scheme applies to the structure on the left. immunogenicity of immunodominant peptides To confirm immunogenicity of these peptides in vivo, we analyzed sera derived from peptide-immunized mice. all of the peptide conjugates except P15 induced potent antibody titers. titers of murine sera were determined as a series of two-fold dilutions by ELISA. the reactivities of anti-peptide sera (1400 dilution) with the purified HA0 protein of the virus were analyzed by Western blot (B) and ELISA (C) eudotype neutralization test was performed against the anti-peptide sera using the H1N1pdm pseudotyped lentivirus. none of the sera against P3, P5, P16, and P31 could effectively inhibit the entry of H1N1pdm HA pseudotypes. Western blot analysis was performed on 293T cell lysates expressing recombinant HA proteins from five human H1N1 strains. 293T cells transfected with an empty vector was used as a control. -actin was used as a loading control. reactivity of anti-P5 sera with two representative influenza type B virus strains was examined by Western blot analysis. results showed that anti-P5 serum reacted well with A/H1N1/PR8/34 virus but not with influenza type B virus strains. 58 to 72, and 318 to 332 of the HA protein of A/California/04/2009 (GenBank number FJ966082.1) are aligned with the region of multiple HA proteins of H1\u2013H16 subtypes and H1-subtype strains isolated in different years by BioEdit software. this analysis showed that the P5 peptide sequence could be identified in 91.6% (9860/10767) of the H1-subtype HA sequence a panel of short peptides derived from P5 (N6\u2013N14, with C-terminus truncation; and C6\u2013C14, with N-terminus truncation) were used to block the binding of anti-P5 antibody to coated P5. antibody induced by the P5-KLH conjugate was inhibited by peptides N10\u2013N14 and the parent peptide P5 to similar extents. anti-P5 serum was tested by ELISA for its ability to bind to P5 peptide in the presence of dilutions of peptide P5\u20137 (LRGVAPL) the reactivities of anti-P5 sera (1400 dilution) with the peptides P6, P5\u20137, and P5 were analyzed by ELISA. a set of 50 peptides with five residues overlapping with adjacent peptides were synthesized. five of these peptides (P3, P5, P15, P16 and P31) were found to react well with the sera tested. these peptides correspond to sequences of amino acid residues 38\u201352, 58\u201372, 158\u2013172, 168\u2013182, and 318\u2013332 in the HA protein. sera (1200 dilution) from 11 H1N1pdm patients and 10 healthy donors were screened for the presence of antibodies to the 50 peptides using ELISA. the positive rate of H1N1pdm sera for each peptide was calculated and plotted. the identified peptides displayed in stereo view. KKC-KLH P30-KLH 308\u2013322 PFQNIHPITIGKCPK-KLH P31-KKC-KLH 318\u2013332 GKCPKYVKSTKLRLA-[Acp]-KKC-KLH # Indicated as the position corresponding to the HA protein of influenza virus strain A/California/04/2009. endpoint titers of antisera in ELISA from mice immunized with peptides were 16,400, 151,200, 151,200, 112,800, 151,200, and 125,600. most of the positive peptides elicit humoral immunity and are highly immunogenic in mice. anti-peptide sera against P3, P5, and P31 did not react to the HA0 protein, although it exhibited a high ELISA reactivity to the HA0 protein (Fig. 2B and 2C). the anti-P16 sera did not react to the HA0 protein, although it exhibited a high reactivity to the HA0 protein. anti-P5 and anti-P31 sera only reacted with the H1 HA proteins. Western blot analysis was performed using lysates from 293T cells transfected with recombinant pCAGGS plasmids expressing HA proteins. virus strain A/PR8/34 (H1N1) (PR8) was used as positive control. additional HA proteins of three epidemic human strains from different years were expressed by pCAGGS vector in 293T cells. aa sequences of P3, P5, and P31 aligned with the corresponding aa sequences of all the 16 subtype HAs available in the GenBank. P3 is identical to HA of the H1 subtype, as well as highly identical to HA of the H2, H5 and H6 subtypes. a panel of short peptides derived from P5 (N6\u2013N14, with C-terminus truncation; and C6\u2013C14, with N-terminus truncation) were used to block the binding of anti-P5 antibody to coated P5. a similar pattern of inhibition was observed with the parent peptide P5. anti-P5 serum was tested by ELISA for its ability to bind to P5 peptide in the presence of dilutions of peptides N6\u2013N14 (panel A) and C6\u2013C14 (panel B). the synthetic peptide LRGVAPL did not block the binding between P5 peptide and its antibody, nor did it directly bind to the P5 antibody. sensitivity and specificity of peptide-ELISA versus HI test was 96.5% and 74.4%, respectively. sensitivity and specificity of peptide-ELISA versus HI test was 96.5% and 74.4%, respectively, indicating the potential of the peptide-ELISA method in detecting antibody against H1-subtype IAVs. two epitopes (P5 and P31) have not been identified previously. the epitope in P5 provides a new target for reliable diagnostics of H1-subtype IAVs. the difference between our findings and previously identified epitopes can be explained by the difference of screening method used between our study and those of others. in previous studies, monoclonal antibodies from murine hybridoma cells were used to identify antigenic sites. in this study we used a peptide scanning approach, which involves overlapping peptide library. runcated peptides showed strongest binding to the corresponding antibody. peptides N10 and C12 are the shortest truncated P5 that can bind to anti-P5 antibody. however, the synthetic peptide LRGVAPL did not block P5-antibody interactions nor bind P5 antibody. each peptide is 15 amino acids in length with five residues overlapping with the adjacent peptides. each peptide is 15 amino acids in length with five residues overlapping with the adjacent peptides. the peptides selected for immunization experiments are shown in Table 1. the titers of virus strains were determined by hemagglutination tests. for western blot analysis, the inactivated viruses were lyzed in a lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Triton-X, pH 7.4) recombinant plasmids were transfected into 293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000. the cells were harvested and lyzed 72 hours after transfection. the expression of HA proteins was verified by Western blot analysis. the optical density at 450 nm (OD450 nm) was measured by an ELISA plate reader. peptide-inhibition ELISA assays were performed by adding dilutions of the peptides to a constant amount of the antibody. maximum binding to antigen-coated wells was observed in the absence of a peptide inhibitor. or virus lysates were blotted after 10% SDS-PAGE onto nitrocellulose membranes (Pall, Port Washington, NY) the membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat milk and then incubated with the primary antibodies indicated in the figures at 4\u00b0C overnight. the membranes were scanned by the Odyssey\u00ae Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE) ethylenimine (PEI)-based transfection protocol used in pseudotype neutralization test. serum mixtures were added into 96-well plates that contained 293T cells. infectivity was evaluated at 72 hr post-infection by luciferase assay. a set of 50 peptides spanning the amino acid sequences of the HA protein ectodomain of influenza virus strain A/H1N1 2009 were synthesized. each peptide is 15 amino acids in length with five residues overlapping with the adjacent peptides. reference influenza virus strains A/PR8/34 (H1N1) (abbreviated PR8), B/hubeiwujiagang/158/2009 (Yamagata lineage, abbreviated BY) and B/heilongjianghulan/116/2010 (Victoria lineage, abbreviated BV) were provided by the Beijing Center for Disease Control and Prevention. cDNA fragments corresponding to H2\u2013H16 HA subtypes of IAV were inserted into the pCAGGS vector. a swine influenza virus strain was expressed by inserting the corresponding cDNA fragments into the pCAGGS vector in a similar manner. the cells were harvested and lyzed 72 hours after transfection. animal immunizations Female BALB/c mice of 6\u20138 weeks old were immunized subcutaneously with various peptide-KLH conjugates mixed with Freund's Complete Adjuvant (Sigma) the antibodies were collected five days after the third boost. western blot at 72 hr post-transfection, cells transfected with HA-expressing plasmids were harvested, pelleted, and lyzed in a lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Triton-X, pH 7.4) the membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat milk and then incubated with the primary antibodies indicated in the figures at 4\u00b0C 50 l of 1% chicken erythrocyte suspension was added to each well and incubated for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. positive reactions were recorded when the HI antibody titer was equal to or greater than 40. two programs were used in this study to define the number of total sequences in HA proteins according to the Subtype parameter (H1 or H2\u2013H16) the latter program defined the number of hits (P5 or P31) in the H1 or H2\u2013H16 total sequences."}
