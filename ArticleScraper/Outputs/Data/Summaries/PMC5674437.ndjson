{"summary": "BVDV is a common infection of cattle worldwide so that most herds are at risk for infection. it can cause severe economic losses due to decreased fertility and milk production, slow fetal growth, diarrhea, respiratory symptoms, reproductive dysfunctions. bovine viral diarrhea virus has been found in sheep, goats, pigs, buffaloes and wildlife. the chance of transmission to or from cattle has not been fully established. Isolation of the virus in wild ruminant animals such as deer and elk in north America has been reported. BVDV The genus Pestivirus is composed of four recognized species, BVDV-1 and BVDV-2 (previously referred to as genotypes 1 and 2), classical swine fever virus and border disease virus. there are hundreds of different strains of the virus, characterized by viral nucleotide sequence comparison or by monoclonal antibody (MAb) serotyping. the rare cytopathic (CP) biotype will damage tissue cultures. non-cytopathic viruses are associated with the majority of BVDV infections (>90%). transient BVDV infections can be divided into five categories: acute, severe acute, hemorrhagic infection, bovine respiratory disease and immuno-suppression-only. genome 2 includes BVDV strains associated with high mortality acute and peracute infections, thrombocytopenia and hemorrhaging. BVDV-1 strains are predominant in most part of the world, whereas BVDV-2 was recognized as the cause of severe acute haemorragic disease in North America. a new pestivirus species, tentatively called HoBi-like (BVDV3), or atypical Pestivirus, was recently identified in fetal bovine serum imported BVDV has been isolated from many captive and free-living ruminants. pigs with no indication of virus transmission from cattle have also been described. BVDV infection in pigs with no indication of virus transmission from cattle has also been described. BVDV antigen was detected in two neonate calves with clinical signs of congenital tremor. other mechanisms of vertical transmission include: contaminated semen, embryo transfer, and modified live vaccines. cattle have been infected following insemination with frozen semen from these animals. infected animals shed virus in nasal and oral secretions, less so in feces and urine. the disease is important in pregnant cattle because of the ability of the virus to cross the placenta and cause intrauterine infections of the fetus. in some cases, a thrombocytopenic syndrome with clinical symptoms including epistax. BVDV has the ability to cross the placenta and cause intrauterine infections. the outcome of fetal infections in susceptible heifers and cows is dependent on the age of the fetus when exposed. if the fetus survives the early infection, they invariably become PI. persistently infected animals remain viremic for life, and are immunotolerant to homologous NCP BVD viruses. a non-lytic infection produced by NCP BVDV strains and the ability to evade the host immune response is the primary mechanism of persistence. Approximately 50% of BVDV PI calves will die during the first year of life due to other pathogens that affect PI animals more severely. some PI calves can survive until maturity and if retained for breeding, their offspring is always PI but often fails to survive. mucosal disease occurs when PI animals become infected with a closely related CP strain of BVDV. the result is an overwhelming infection that destroys cells and to which the animal is incapable of responding. post-mortem examinations reveal erosions and ulcers in the mucosa. severe acute BVD or MD closely resembles rinderpest clinically and grossly. the pathological lesions are confined in several body systems. the main pathological findings include widespread mucosal congestion. interstitial emphysema, pneumonia and fibrinous pleural adherence are commonly found in the respiratory tract. in aborted fetuses, the principal lesions include conjunctivitis, pneumonia, thymus hypoplasia and non-specific myocarditis. the affected crypts can be dilated and contained large amounts of cell debris with mixed neutrophils and macrophages (cryptitis) the affected crypts were dilated with mucus and cellular debris. an acute catarrhal inflammation in nasal cavity and trachea can be observed. Virus is available for study at a later date -Slow procedure -Labor-intensive -Potential false negative due to interference by maternal antibodies -Retest positive animals in 3-4 weeks to distinguish between PI and TI -Whole blood (10 ml) or serum (2-3 ml) -Send in container with cold packs -Do not freeze the samples Immunohistochemistry (IHC) 2-5 day turnaround Low cost -High sensitivity -Usually identifie using EDTA or heparin -Tissues -Send in insulated container with cold packs Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 1-3 day turnaround Moderate to high cost (can be reduced pooling samples) -Potential of false positive due to laboratory contamination -Retest samples in 3 weeks to distinguish between PI and TI animals. antigen-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay uses MAb to capture viral antigen Erns glycoprotein (gp48) this structural protein is secreted from infected cells during virus replication and can be detected directly in blood, buffy coat cells, plasma, sera, ear notches or tissue extracts. both samples from PI calves were tested using ACE. sera samples were negative after intake of colostrum. the ear tissue samples were positive for BVDV at all time points. positive immunostaining to BVDV antigen in hepatocytes and Kupffer\u2019s cells is a good, fast and sensitive method. presence of maternal anti-BVDV antibodies therefore does not interfere with the detection of the BVDV antigen. RT-PCR is a reliable diagnostic method at all ages. it is able to detect BVDV even in the presence of maternal antibodies to BVD virus that influence results obtained by VI and ELISA. the pooling could provide an initial, rapid, cost-effective method of screening cattle herds for BVDV PI animals. IHC and ACE from skin samples, VI from white blood cells (WBC) lysates and RT-PCR from PI calves with BVDV were reported."}
