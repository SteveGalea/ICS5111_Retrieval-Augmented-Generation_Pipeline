{"summary": "type I interferons (IFNs) are a group of cytokines consisting of one single IFN-, several IFN- (14 functional isoforms in mice), and the less studied IFN-, -, -, and - isoforms (1, 2). they are produced early after viral infections and critically contribute to host survival by constituting an early, overall antiviral state. IFN ligation initiates the so-called positive feedback amplification loop. proteins of the JAK/STAT pathway are recruited to the receptor complex and get activated, resulting in formation of signaling complexes. signaling complexes (particularly the IFN-stimulated gene factor 3) mediate IRF7 activation. myeloid dendritic cells (mDC) are the main type I IFN producers in vitro. pDC hardly secrete any type I IFNs (23). THOV is a segmented, single-strand, negative-sense RNA-encoded, tick-transmitted orthomyxovirus. IFN--luc/-luc knock-in reporter mice homozygously express firefly luciferase under control of the endogenous IFN- promoter. mice were anesthetized using isoflurane (CP-Pharma) and infected by the intraperitoneal route with a total volume of 200 l of virus in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) a titer of 1 107 fluorescence-forming units (FFU) per ml was determined by infecting vero cells with 10-fold dilutions of the VLP preparations and counting eGFP-positive cells at 24 h postinfection. a titer of 1 106 cells/ml or 2 106 cells/ml was determined by plaque assays. microphage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF; 100 ng/ml; R&D systems) was cultivated for 8 days with one medium change at day 4. medium of the GM-CSF-supplemented cultures (mDC) was changed every 2 days. in vitro stimulation and quantification of cytokine production. cells were stained with fluorochrome-labeled monoclonal antibodies and isotype controls. anti-CD11c-allophycocyanin (APC), anti-CD69-phycoerythrin (PE)-Cy7, anti-B220-PE, rat IgG2b-APC isotype control, and hamster IgG1-APC isotype control. RNA was quantified with a one-step QuantiTect SYBR green reverse transcription-PCR kit (Qiagen) cellular RNA was quantified with primers specific for mouse IFN- (for Mm_Ifnb1_1, primer QT00249662), IFN-2 (Mm_IFN2, QT00253092), RIG-I (Mm_Ddx58_1_SG, QT00123515), and glyceraldeh mice homozygously express firefly luciferase (FF-Luc) under control of the endogenous IFN- promoter. mice were anesthetized using isoflurane (CP-Pharma) mice were infected with a total volume of 200 l of virus in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 293T cells were transfected with expression plasmids encoding the structural proteins of THOV and a reporter minigenome encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) as a control, the expression plasmid encoding the viral matrix protein was omitted from the transfection mixture, resulting in a THOV-VLPM preparation that does not contain functional VLP. medium of the GM-CSF-supplemented cultures was changed every 2 days. for stimulation, in vitro-differentiated DC were seeded at 1 106 cells/well in 24-well culture plates in 1 ml of medium. for UV irradiation of virus or VLP, a UV irradiation chamber (Herolab) was used. cells were stained with fluorochrome-labeled monoclonal antibodies and isotype controls. anti-CD11c-allophycocyanin (APC), anti-CD69-phycoerythrin (PE)-Cy7, anti-B220-PE, rat IgG2b-APC isotype control, and hamster IgG1-APC isotype control. all analyses were performed using a BD LSR II flow cyto m_Ifnb1_1, primer QT00249662), IFN-2 (Mm_IFN2, QT00253092), RIG-I (Mm_Ddx58_1_SG, QT00123515), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; QT01658692). THOV induces robust IFN- and IFN- secretion in mice independently of IFNAR signal pDC and mDC were differentiated from bone marrow of uninfected WT and IFNAR-deficient mice. controls were stimulated with CpG2216 (5 g/ml) or left untreated. at 24 h posttreatment, cells were harvested, and THOV-specific transcripts were quantified via quantitative RT-PCR. mDC and PEC from infected pDC showed strong IFN- secretion. however, IFN- production by infected pDC was only marginal. this indicates a tropism of THOV for mDC. C57BL/6 (WT; n = 6 to 8) and IFNAR-deficient (IFNAR/; n = 6 to 8) mice were i.p. infected with 2 104 PFU of THOV. cell-free supernatants were harvested, and IFN- was measured using an ELISA. infected animals with THOV for 6, 12, and 24 h and determined IFN- production in lysates of spleen, liver, and lung and in the fluid within the peritoneal cavity. robust IFN- levels were detected in the peritoneal cavity and spleen of WT and IFNAR/ mice at 24 h postinfection. after 24 h of in vivo infection, cells are no longer able to produce IFN- within the next 24 h of in vitro culture. this suggestion is supported by the FACS data showing that the CD11b+ F4/80+ cell population within the peritoneal cavity gets activated between 6 and 12 h postinfection. THOV infection enables robust IFN- production independently of the positive feedback loop via the IFNAR. UV irradiation abolished the IFN--inducing capacity of THOV-VLP. thOV-VLP infection was sensed via RLH (MAVS-dependent) but not via TLR (MyD88- and TRIF-dependent) to induce IFN- secretion. at 48 h postinfection, spleen cells and PEC were analyzed for percentages of eGFP-positive cells by FACS. controls were left untreated or incubated with comparable amounts of a VLP preparation generated in the absence of viral matrix protein (THOV-VLPM) at 24 h posttreatment, cells were analyzed for percentages of eGFP-positive cells by FACS. ns, not significant; **, P 0.01; ***, P 0.001 (unpaired two-tailed t test); bd, below detection limit. we used IFN-mob/mob mice that express YFP along with IFN- under the control of the endogenous IFN- promoter to detect cells by FACS analyses (30). Upon THOV infection, we detected YFP-positive (YFP+) cells in the peritoneal cavity when gating on CD11b+ cells in both IFN-mob/mob and IFN-mob/mob IFNAR/ mice. IFN-mob/mob and IFN-mob/mob IFNAR/ mice were i.p. infected with 2 104 PFU of THOV. YFP reporter gene expression was analyzed in CD11b+ and CD11c+ cells. THOV-, IFN--, IFN-2-, and RIG-I-specific transcripts were quantified via quantitative RT-PCR. data are given as fold change compared to values for uninfected WT and IFNAR/ CD11b cells. luciferase is expressed under control of the endogenous IFN- promoter (29) b+ cells from both WT and IFNAR-deficient mice are more prone to THOV infection than their CD11b counterparts. however, only CD11b+ IFNAR/ and not CD11b IFNAR/ cells showed type I IFN mRNA expression upon THOV infection. THOV induces robust IFN- and IFN- secretion in mice independently of IFNAR signaling. IFNAR-independent IFN- induction by THOV in vivo but not in vitro. pDC and mDC differentiated from bone marrow of uninfected mice. controls were left untreated (uninf.) we generated pDC and mDC from bone marrow and isolated peritoneal exudate cells (PEC), mostly myeloid cells and macrophages, from the peritoneal cavity. Upon THOV infection, mDC and PEC from WT animals showed strong IFN- secretion. however, IFN- production by infected pDC was only marginal. only minimal IFNAR-independent IFN- secretion can be detected in ex vivo cultures upon in vivo infection. spleen cells and PEC were isolated and cultured in vitro for 24 h without any additional stimulus. in the lower rows, numbers indicate percentages of cells positive for CD69 (gated on F4/80+ CD11b+ cells) Error bars indicate standard deviations. ns, not significant (unpaired two-tailed t test) CD11b+ F4/80+ cells showed an activated phenotype upon infection. this was dramatically reduced in IFNAR-deficient mice. this is in line with previous data showing that CD69 upregulation is, at least in part, type I IFN dependent. intraperitoneal infection of WT and IFNAR-deficient mice with 106 FFU of eGFP-encoding THOV-VLP induced systemic IFN- secretion. thOV-VLP infection was sensed via RLH (MAVS-dependent) but not via TLR (MyD88- and TRIF-dependent) to induce IFN- secretion. at 24 h posttreatment, cell-free supernatants were harvested. IFN- was measured using an ELISA. pDC and mDC were differentiated from bone marrow of C57BL/6. cells were infected with THOV-VLP encoding eGFP by the viral minigenome (106 FFU; black lines) control cells were incubated with comparable amounts of a VLP preparation generated in the absence of viral matrix protein (THOV-VLPM) CD11b+ F4/80+ cells from the peritoneal cavity account for IFNAR-independent type I IFN production. we previously showed that IFN- and IFN- are coregulated upon THOV infection. well-established reporter mice for IFN- expression are available. IFN-mob/mob and IFN-mob/mob IFNAR/ mice were i.p. infected with 2 104 PFU of THOV. at 18 h postinfection PEC were isolated and pooled. YFP reporter gene expression was analyzed in CD11b+ and CD11c+ cells. firefly luciferase (FF-Luc) activity was measured. at 6 h postinfection PEC were isolated, pooled, and subjected to MACS using CD11b-specific microbeads. we infected mice with THOV, separated CD11b from CD11b+ cells by the MACS technique. these data show that CD11b+ cells from both WT and IFNAR-deficient mice are more prone to THOV infection than their CD11b counterparts. however, only CD11b+ IFNAR/ cells showed type I IFN mRNA expression upon THOV infection. pDC were shown to be the main type I IFN-producing cell type (38, 39) levels were dramatically reduced compared to those in their WT counterparts. in contrast, myeloid cells such as mDC and CD11b+ cells from the peritoneal cavity are most responsive upon THOV infection. experiments with mixed cultures of infected and uninfected cells did not result in robust IFN- secretion in vitro. if in vivo conditions involve the interaction of several cell types and/or the cooperation between infected and uninfected cells will be a matter of future investigations. this suggests that the viral load is of great importance for the magnitude of IFN- responses. the cellular mechanism used by myeloid cells for robust IFN- production might include enhanced basal expression of pathogen sensors. such a mechanism was suggested by Hui et al. for infection with an H5N1 influenza virus, demonstrating that virus-induced mediators upregulated RIG-I in uninfected cells. however, our own quantitative RT-PCR data do not suggest enhanced RIG-I expression in IFNAR-deficient cells (46) CD11b cells and CD11c+ cells from both WT and IFNAR-deficient animals were rather unresponsive upon infection. these results are in line with data showing a clear tropism of THOV for myeloid CD11b+ cells and much less for pDC. however, in both reporter mouse systems used, we never detected any type I IFN or reporter gene signal, respectively, within the spleens."}
