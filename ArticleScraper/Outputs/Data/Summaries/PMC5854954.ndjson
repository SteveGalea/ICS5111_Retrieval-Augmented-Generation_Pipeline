{"summary": "rhesus -defensin (RTD)-1 is a therapy for acute lung injury. in vitro studies, this research highlights the potential of rhesus -defensin. differential cell counts were determined via hemocytometer (Hausser Scientific) multiple analyte levels in BALF were determined using multiplex ELISA kits. peroxidase (POD) was measured by tetramethylbenzidine, as previously described (23). mice were killed 48 hours after LPS administration. a significance level of P less than 0.05 was determined a priori. in vitro studies Neutrophil migration and adhesion was assessed using peripheral blood neutrophils from healthy volunteers. multiple analyte levels in BALF were determined using multiplex ELISA kits. peroxidase (POD) was measured by tetramethylbenzidine. mice were killed after 0.5, 1, 3, 7, 24, 48 hours. Statistical analysis was performed using STATA version 13 (STATA Corp.) and GraphPad Prism version 6.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc.) a significance level of P less than 0.05 was determined a priori. results RTD-1 inhibits neutrophil migration and Adhesion. in rosewell park memorial institute medium were pretreated with RTD-1 or PBS. inserts were then placed in the presence of 15 ng/ml CXCL8 to induce chemotaxis. cells in the basolateral chamber are expressed as percent normalized migrated cells. treatment compared with control by one-way ANOVA. a dose\u2013response experiment was performed using a sigmoidal maximum effect model. the data were best described by a sigmoidal maximum effect model. the data were best described by a sigmoidal maximum effect model. to evaluate the effect of RTD-1 on epithelial inflammation, we analyzed cytokine concentrations from LPS-stimulated A549 cells. basal and LPS-stimulated cytokine expression was significantly reduced in the A549 (pg/ml) when compared with the MH-S cells (ng/ml) total inflammatory cell counts in BALF were increased approximately 32-fold (P 0.0001) in LPS-untreated mice compared with sham mice. no mortality was observed in the disease model. treatment with RTD-1 resulted in a significant decrease in neutrophils. BALF protein levels increased 3.8-fold (P 0.001) after LPS challenge in untreated mice compared with sham mice. RTD-1 treatment at doses of 5 and 25 mg/kg achieved significant reductions in IL-1 (P 0.05) and TNF (P 0.01) when compared with sham controls. no treatment differences were observed in the levels of IL-1, KC, MCP-1, MIP-1, or MIP-1 when compared with LPS-untreated mice. mice received pretreatment with 0, 0.2, 1, 5, or 25 mg/kg RTD-1 0.5 hour before 1-g intranasal LPS instillation. a time course study was conducted to assess the direct effects of RTD-1 on airway neutrophilia, cytokine proteins, and gene expression. no treatment effects were observed for IL-6, or the soluble receptor antagonists profiled. RTD-1 significantly reduced mRNA levels of TNF (1.560 fold change [FC]; P 0.01), IL-1 (1.386 FC; P 0.0001), IL-6 (1.393 FC; P 0.01), MCP-1 (3.396 FC; P 0.0001), MIP-2 (1.496 FC; P 0.001), and KC (1.277 FC; P 0.01) in mouse whole-lung homogenate. at T0 and TNF (0.40 FC; P 0.01), IL-1 (0.43 FC; 0.01), IL-6 (0.66 FC; 0.001), and IP-10 (0.67 FC; P 0.001) at T12. dexamethasone reduced IL-1 (0.40 FC; P 0.05), KC (0.27 FC; P 0.05; data not shown) -1 dose to evaluate disease severity at 24 hours as measured by histology and lung pathology scoring. we compared the presence of congestion, interstitial and alveolar leukocytes, and alveolar hyaline membranes between RTD-1\u2013treated, LPS-untreated, and sham mice. in vitro methods investigated the effect of RTD-1 on cell migration using human blood neutrophils in a transwell migration assay. rhesus -defensin (RTD)-1 treatment significantly reduced CXCL8-stimulated chemotaxis when compared with control. treatment with RTD-1 resulted in roughly 5-, 3-, 154-, and 4-fold reductions in MIP-2 (P 0.0001), MCP-1 (P 0.01), TNF (P 0.001), and IL-6 (P 0.001), respectively. soluble cytokines, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-2 (A), keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC) (B), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 (C), IL-6 (D) and TNF (E); n = 3 per group; mean (SD); treatment compared with control by unpaired two-sample t test. TD-1 induced a doubling (1.07-fold increase) of IL-6 in LPS-stimulated A549 cells. no cytotoxicity was observed by the alamar blue method. treatment with RTD-1 was not associated with any increases in airway macrophages when compared with LPS-untreated mice (P > 0.05) mice received subcutaneous pretreatment with 0, 0.2, 1, 5, or 25 g/ml RTD-1 0.5 hour before 1 g intranasal LPS instillation. RTD-1 inhibits LPS-induced Inflammatory Cytokines/Chemokines. no treatment differences were observed in the levels of IL-1, KC, MCP-1, or MIP-1 when compared with sham mice. n = 6 mice per group; geometric mean (95% CI) treatment compared with control by one-way ANOVA with the Bonferroni post test *P 0.05, **P 0.01, ***P 0.001. cytokines (A) IL-1, (B) TNF, and (C) IL-6 are shown. BALF was obtained at the times noted for MIP-2 (A), KC (B), TNF (C), IL-1 (D) and total cell counts (E) in a separate set of mice, changes in 3-hour lung homogenate cytokine mRNA levels were evaluated (F). treatment with RTD-1 resulted in a significant dose-dependent decrease in airway leukocytes in response to LPS starting as early as 3 hours. RTD-1 exhibits antiinflammatory effects up to 12 hours after LPS insufflation. one death occurred in the RTD-1 T0 group 12 hours after LPS insufflation. dexamethasone also significantly reduced lung neutrophilia at T12. 25 mg/kg RTD-1 was administered at 0 or 12 hours after 1-g LPS instillation. as a comparator agent, 2 mg/kg dexamethasone (Dex) was given at 0 hour. mice received pretreatment with 0 or 25 mg/kg RTD-1 0.5 hour before 1-g LPS insufflation. cationic antimicrobial peptides have demonstrated efficacy in murine models of sepsis-induced ALI. cationic antimicrobial peptides are macrocyclic cationic peptides with antimicrobial and immunomodulatory activities. the -defensin, RTD-1, yields protective effects in mitigating ALI by reducing proinflammatory cytokines, neutrophil infiltration, alveolar\u2013capillary membrane leakage, and lung injury. a fundamental feature of ALI is the vascular emigration and interstitial migration of neutrophils into the lung compartment. the early treatment differences of airway neutrophils (3\u20137 h) compared with LPS control mice suggest that RTD-1 may directly inhibit neutrophil emigration from the vasculature. RTD-1 treatment was associated with reduced pulmonary edema in vivo. antiinflammatory and ALI-protective effects were observed when RTD-1 was administered 12 hours after LPS insufflation supporting its potential as a treatment for ALI. phosphorylated Akt acts as a negative regulator of NF-B and mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation in macrophage/monocyte cells. this is consistent with our in vivo gene expression data suggesting that RTD-1 modulates TLR signaling activity and subsequently mRNA levels and soluble cytokines. the -defensin RTD-1 exhibited antiinflammatory effects comparable to 2 mg/kg dexamethasone in a murine model of ALI. in vitro findings suggest that RTD-1 reduced in vivo lung injury and airway neutrophilia by directly inhibiting neutrophil migration."}
