{"summary": "TACE expression was observed in RAM-11-positive areas of atherosclerotic lesions. TACE expression was also expressed in the intimal smooth muscle cells. expression levels of TACE in unstable plaques were significantly higher than in stable plaques. the levels of mRNA and protein expression of TACE in the abdominal aortic plaques were lowered by 53.5%, 70.4% and 65.1% at 1 week, 2 weeks and 8 weeks after lentivirus transfection. however, there was no significant difference in the TACE mRNA or protein expression levels between the control and mock groups. remodeling index and plaque burden were significantly lower in the TACE shRNA group than the control and mock groups. however, these imaging parameters did not differ between the control and the mock groups.

TACE shRNA reduced MMP activities in aortic plaques Western-blot showed that the protein expression level of MMP2 but not MMP9 was substantially lower in the TACE shRNA group than the control and mock groups. however, gelatin zymography revealed both activities of MMP9 and MMP2 were dramatically down-regulated in the TACE shRNA group than the control and mock groups. all the gels have been run under the same experimental conditions. black lines indicated the cropped gels and blots. black lines indicated the cropped gels and blots. all the gels have been run under the same experimental conditions. black lines indicated the cropped blots, and full-length blots were presented in Supplementary Fig. 6. serum level of total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol and body weight did not differ. the serum levels of soluble inflammatory factors including sTNF-, sICAM-1, sVCAM-1 and sMCP-1 were significantly lower in the TACE shRNA group. the relative reduction of sTNF-, sICAM-1, sVCAM-1 and sMCP-1 in the TACE shRNA group was 72%, 26%, 28% and 21% respectively. sTNF- and sICAM-1 ( = 0.363, P 0.001) played major roles in plaque vulnerability. sTNF- and sICAM-1 played major roles in plaque vulnerability. blots show collagen I and collagen III expression in mouse VSMCs. neovessel tube formation in three groups of HUVECs. a fibrous cap thickness less than 100 m has been identified as a marker of unstable plaques19,20. we used this cut-off value to differentiate unstable from stable plaques. aortic plaques correlated significantly with macrophage content and neovessel number in plaques. increased MMP activity in aortic plaques appears to be the most important risk factor of plaque rupture. both MMP9 and MMP2 localized in human vulnerable plaques are capable of active collagenolysis and have been reported to contribute to plaque expansion. ized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 from macrophages into circulation15. these results suggest that inflammatory factors may activate TACE. release of adhesion molecules by TACE may stimulate adhesive leukocytes to migrate and infiltrate into inflamed tissue. inhibition of local inflammation may be a major contributor to the therapeutic effect of TACE gene silencing in our rabbit model. neovascularization in the adventitia plays an important role in creating a conduit for lipids and inflammatory cells to be transported into plaques to enlarge the necrotic core. endogenous TACE was highly expressed in unstable plaques. mechanisms may involve attenuated macrophage infiltration, inflammatory cytokine expression, neovascularization and neovascularization. mechanisms may involve attenuated macrophage infiltration, inflammatory cytokine expression, neovascularization and vascular positive remodeling. oligonucleotides were annealed and cloned into pGLV1-1 between the HpaI and XhoI sites. the vector was transfected into 293T cells together with the viral packaging vectors. the experiment protocol complied with the Animal Management Rule of the Ministry of Health, People\u2019s Republic of China. intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) study and lentivirus suspension transduction protocol IVUS study was performed at week 8 and 16 by use of a 3.2 F catheter. the image resolution was 150 mm and 300 mm respectively in axial and lateral direction. the IVUS images were reviewed by two independent observers. the averaged values were used for data analyses. animals were administered an overdose of sodium pentobarbital. value of 100m19: stable plaques (>100 m) and unstable plaques (100 m) fibrous caps in adjacent species stained with Sirius red were defined as areas consisting of collagen fibers covering the lipid core. sections were treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes, blocked with 5% normal BSA at 37 \u00b0C for 20 minutes. neovessels were identified as channels surrounded by a layer of endothelial cells highlighted by immunostaining with anti-CD31 antibody. the color was developed with the DAB chromogen and counterstained with hematoxylin. rabbit anti-mouse p-ERK polyclonal antibody (1:1000, Cell Signal), rabbit anti-mouse p-P38 polyclonal antibody (1:1000, Cell Signal), goat anti-human -actin polyclonal antibody (1:1500, Santa Cruz Biotecholog, USA) after each antibody incubation, the blot was washed (three times;
