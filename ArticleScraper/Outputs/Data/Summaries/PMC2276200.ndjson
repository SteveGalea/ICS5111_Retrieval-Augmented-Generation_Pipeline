{"summary": "Background La Crosse virus (LACV), family Bunyaviridae, was first identified as a human pathogen in 1960 after its isolation from a 4 year-old girl with fatal encephalitis in La Crosse, Wisconsin. the virus is a major cause of pediatric encephalitis in North America and infects up to 300,000 persons each year of which 70\u2013130 result in severe disease of the central nervous system (CNS) virus is transmitted by hardwood forest dwelling mosquitoes, Aedes triseriatus. virus can be maintained in the mosquito population in absence of vertebrate hosts by transovarial (vertical) transmission, thus allowing the virus to over-winter in mosquito eggs. in humans, the majority of infections are mild and attributed to the \"flu\" or \"summer cold\" the majority of infections are mild and attributed to the \"flu\" or \"summer cold\" with an estimated 300,000 infections annually. there are only 70\u2013130 serious cases reported. children who recover from severe La Crosse encephalitis may have significantly lower IQ scores than expected. a high prevalence (60% of those tested) of attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder is also common in survivors [23]. Projected lifelong economic costs associated with neurologic sequelae range from $48,775 \u2013 3,090,398 per case. rhesus monkeys were chosen because they are susceptible to a variety of neurotropic arboviruses, including flaviviruses. rhesus monkeys were infected intramuscularly or subcutaneously with a mosquito or human isolate of LACV. infection did not result in viremia, disease, or significant changes in blood chemistries or cell counts. virus was detected in serum on days 1\u20133, but rarely on subsequent days even in moribund mice. by day three, virus distribution was widespread and could be found in most tissues sampled. highest virus titers detected were present in nasal turbinates, brain, and spinal cord. aPercent of mice positive by plaque assay represented by shading: 100% black, 66% dark gray, 33% light gray, 0% no data entry. Mean virus titer calculated only for virus positive tissues. the ID50 titers (1.5 and 1.6 log10 PFU for the IN and IP routes, respectively) were slightly lower than the LD50 titers. LACV is highly virulent in mice inoculated by either the intraperitoneal (IP) or intranasal (IN) route. changes in percent survival did not occur after day 10. the most extensive lesions occurred in the medulla oblongata. the most extensive lesions occurred in the medulla oblongata. hematoxylin counterstain X200.

OptiPROTMSFM medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 4 mM L-glutamine. LACV/human/1960 was isolated from post-mortem brain tissue collected from a Minnesota patient hospitalized in La Crosse, Wisconsin. Biological clones were generated by terminal dilution in Vero cells. the Swiss Webster mice were inoculated with 1 or 100 LD50 in a volume of 100 l [6]. the tissues indicated in Table 1 were collected individually (3 mice per day for 6 days at each dose of virus), weighed, homogenized in L15 with SPG buffer. all mice were carefully observed twice daily for clinical disease including tremors and limb paralysis. tissues collected for pathology were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF) sections were prepared at 4\u20135 (m) when bone was present in the tissue, as with muscle, nasal cavity, and spinal cord, tissues were decalcified using Immunocal. sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) the primary antibody, rabbit anti-human CD3, was used at a dilution of 1:300. slides were stream hydrated with citrate buffer for 20 minutes. rhesus monkeys (n = 4) were inoculated with 101 or 103 PFU LACV/mosquito/1978-clone subcutaneously. blood samples were collected on days 0, 21, 28, and 42 post inoculation for neutralizing antibody titration. LACV/human/1960 was isolated from post-mortem brain tissue collected from a Minnesota patient hospitalized in La Crosse, Wisconsin and passaged two times in C6/36 cells. Biological clones were generated by terminal dilution in Vero cell cultures. the tissues indicated in Table 1 were collected individually (3 mice per day for 6 days at each dose of virus), weighed, homogenized in L15 with SPG buffer (final concentration 218 mM sucrose, 6 mM L-glutamic acid, 3.8 mM dibasic potassium phosphate, pH 7.2) mice were carefully observed twice daily for clinical disease including tremors and limb paralysis. sections were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF) for a minimum of 72 hours. tissue was decalcified using Immunocal (Decal Chemical Corp. Tallman, NY) sections were deparaffinized with xylene and washed with deionized water. a serial section was saved for immunohistochemical staining. the primary antibody, rabbit anti-human CD3, was used at a dilution of 1:300. slides were stream hydrated with citrate buffer for 20 minutes. each virus was inoculated intramuscularly (n = 4) or subcutaneously (n = 4). blood samples were collected on days 0, 21, 28, and 42 post inoculation for neutralizing antibody titration. test sera were heat inactivated (56\u00b0C for 30 minutes) and serial 2-fold dilutions beginning at 1:5 or 1:10 were prepared in OptiMEM. authors wish to thank Mark Hughs for the LACV/human/1978 and Bob Tesh for the LACV/mosquito/1978 and LACV/human/1960 stocks."}
