{"summary": "china announced the world\u2019s first three human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) in china. this followed by reports of further cases in over 16 provinces/municipalities of china. most human cases of A(H7N9) were severe and were characterized by rapidly progressive pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. the outbreak started on 31 March and the majority of cases during the first wave of the outbreak were recorded in April. daily reporting of cases by the NHFPC web site was only available during the first wave. weibo users\u2019 interest in A(H7N9) plummeted briefly on 21 April and 24 April. a peak of 48 255 daily posts was recorded on 16 April when the highest daily number of 16 cases was reported. weibo users with the timeliest report on new cases comprised province/municipality-based news agencies. the veracity of the data reported from these users is likely to be high. the announcement at the NHFPC web site typically lagged behind. the transcript was posted in real-time on the NHFPC\u2019s Weibo feed. weibo also provided access to additional crowd-sourced epidemiological information on infected cases. a weibo user posted pictures of dead sparrows in a Nanjing residential area. the local authority promptly responded by cleaning the implicated premises and testing samples from the dead sparrows. a medical document of a new case was soon disclosed by a weibo user. weibo was a platform leveraged by central/provincial governments, local news agencies and the public for the timely release and retrieval of information. the social networking sites\u2019 timeliness of reporting are significantly better compared to international mainstream media in English, official web sites of the central Chinese government and WHO. re-posting can be insignificant due to apathy, low media coverage or diversion of public interest to other events. despite this, re-posting can be still be insignificant due to apathy and low media coverage. the use of weibo for the A(H7N9) outbreak in china would be more appropriate than global social media platforms such as twitter. language barriers can pose additional challenges; our ability to access and accurately interpret information from Weibo was partly due to our being based in Singapore where Mandarin is an official language. social media challenges warrant future research and collaboration between public health agencies and computational scientists."}
