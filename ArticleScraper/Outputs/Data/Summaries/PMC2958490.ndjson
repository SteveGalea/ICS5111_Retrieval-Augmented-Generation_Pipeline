{"summary": "URIs are exceedingly prevalent in infants and young children. infants and young children may have 3\u20138 episodes of cold per year. those who attend daycare centers may have many more episodes per year. flocked swabs consist of nylon fibers perpendicular to the swab shaft. flocked swabs act like a brush to collect respiratory epithelial cells. polyurethane foam swabs performed better than flocked swabs. both nasopharyngeal and nasal swabs were found to be superior to nasal washes for the detection of influenza viruses by a rapid antigen immunoassay in pediatric subjects [20]. a recently advocated sampling approach is the swabbing of both the throat and anterior nares as a single specimen. polyurethane foam swabs of the anterior nares performed better than flocked swabs for detection of influenza viruses in children. nasopharyngeal and nasal swabs were found to be superior to nasal washes for detection of influenza viruses by a rapid antigen immunoassay. rapid immunoassays are widely used for the detection of influenza viruses and RSV. rapid immunoassay formats include membrane-based enzyme immunoassay, lateral flow immunochromatography, and optical immunoassay. most test results are read manually by eye although one test includes an automated reader. a study showed excellent sensitivity of a human metapneumovirus DFA performed on nasopharyngeal aspirates from children. DFA was substantially more sensitive than rapid immunoassays for detection of the novel 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus, though less sensitive than virus isolation and/or RT-PCR. gglutination assays use engineered reporter viruses. pseudotyped lentiviral particles express the hemagglutinin protein but are replication deficient. microneutralization assays employ either infectious or noninfectious reporter viruses. real-time PCR instruments are limited in the number of emission channels available for multiplexing. commercially available multiplex real-time PCR kits are generally limited to the detection of four or fewer nucleic acid targets. one of the targets is usually an internal control. rapid immunoassays are widely used for the detection of influenza viruses and RSV. the sensitivity of rapid immunoassays in pediatric patients is generally higher than that of cell culture due to the lability of RSV. recent advances in DFA tests include availability of FDA-cleared commercial DFA reagents for detection of human metapneumovirus. study showed excellent sensitivity (95% versus RT-PCR) of a human metapneumovirus DFA performed on nasopharyngeal aspirates from children. rapid immunoassays are widely used for the detection of influenza viruses and RSV. the specificity of DFA is high but depends on experienced technologists. recent advances in DFA tests include availability of FDA-cleared commercial DFA reagents for detection of human metapneumovirus. the turn-around time of conventional cell culture in tubes for respiratory viruses is generally too long to be clinically relevant. serology is limited by the need to collect both acute and convalescent sera to identify either seroconversion or a fourfold rise in antibody titer. serologic methods that detect IgG responses usually have little impact on patient management. recent advances in serologic assays for respiratory viruses are limited to novel microagglutination assays. real-time PCR is well suited for quantitative analysis, but currently available commercially kits for detection of respiratory virus nucleic acids have only qualitative claims. commercially available multiplex real-time PCR kits are generally limited to the detection of four or fewer nucleic acid targets. the high sensitivity of molecular amplification tests has made the interpretation of positive results challenging. these assays detect respiratory virus nucleic acid in the absence of symptoms [44\u201346] and also indicate that nucleic acids persist following infection [47, 48] highly multiplexed assays can detect more pathogens in a single PCR reaction than real-time PCR. the high sensitivity of molecular amplification tests has made the interpretation of positive results challenging. these assays detect respiratory virus nucleic acid in the absence of symptoms [44\u201346] and also indicate that nucleic acids persist following infection. the future will likely promise additional commercial test kits for molecular detection of respiratory viruses, including multiplexed assays. additional research is needed to elucidate the clinical significance of positive PCR results that are persistent in a patient."}
