{"summary": "a 74-year-old immunocompromised man was transferred to our ICU from a hospital where the original cluster of SARS cases occurred (2). the patient originally had signs and symptoms consistent with a presumptive diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia. before transfer, SARS was excluded because the patient had not traveled, had never left the emergency department of the referring hospital. questionnaire elicited demographic information, details about health, and information about exposure to the index patient. time of exposure was categorized as follows: 1 min, 1\u201310 min, 11\u201330 min, 31\u201360 min, 1\u20134 h, or >4 h. the healthcare workers were divided into two groups by examining all possible cutpoints of all predictor variables to find the cutpoint of a predictor variable that resulted in the largest difference in the probabilities of developing SARS between the two resulting subgroups. this procedure was performed repeatedly for each resulting subgroup until all members of the subgroup had the same SARS status. median time from exposure to index patient to onset of symptoms was 5 days (range 3\u20138 days) all probable case-patients were hospitalized and required oxygen but did not require ICU care. all admitted case-patients were discharged. median hospital stay was 19.5 days (range 13\u201325 days). cPatient 7 was classified as a suspected case, as she did not have radiographic lung infiltrates. all six healthcare workers in whom SARS developed and who entered the patient\u2019s room reported being present >11 min; three were in the room for >4 hours. time spent in index patient\u2019s room depends on time spent in index patient\u2019s room (N=31)a. six healthcare workers with SARS who entered the patient\u2019s room also touched the patient. three of the six healthcare workers reported wearing gloves during this contact. two of the three healthcare workers present during endotracheal intubation wore a gown, surgical mask, and gloves. one healthcare worker wore a gown, gloves, and surgical mask during the procedure. another was a respiratory therapist who helped prepare the necessary equipment while wearing gown, gloves, and an N-95 mask. a healthcare worker spent >4 hours with the index patient. this worker wore an N-95 mask, gloves, and gown during exposure. this worker wore an N-95 mask, gloves, and gown during exposure. intubation of airway Patient 2 ICU nurse 31\u201360 min N-95 mask, gown, gloves \u2022 Performed difficult intubation of airway Patient 4 Registered nurse 31\u201360 min Gown, gloves, surgical mask \u2022 Assigned to patient 3 rooms down hall from index patient Patient 5 Anesthetist 10\u201330 min Gown, gloves, surgical mask \u2022 Frequently manipulated oxygen mask aICU, intensive-care unit; NPPV, noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation. time spent in index patient\u2019s room (N=31)a depends on time spent in index patient\u2019s room (N=31)a. six healthcare workers with SARS who entered the index patient\u2019s room also touched the patient. three of the six healthcare workers reported wearing gloves during this contact. of the 13 healthcare workers without SARS, 12 (92%) used gloves when touching the patient. does not include results for one healthcare worker who had no history of entering the index patient\u2019s room. workers who remained well, reported being present in the room for >31 minutes during the administration of NPPV (OR 105, 95% CI 3 to 3,035, p 0.0001) one of the 4 healthcare workers in whom SARS developed wore an N-95 mask during NPPV therapy. the disease did not occur in any other healthcare workers who had not touched or had close contact with the index patient. a nurse may have come within sufficient range of the patient to be exposed to large droplets. if the coronavirus is spread by large droplets, the nurse may have come within sufficient range of the patient to be exposed to large droplets. despite lack of knowledge about the transmissibility of SARS at the time this exposure occurred, we made a conservative decision to quarantine for 10 days all persons who were in the unit for at least 4 h or who had a history of entry into the affected patient\u2019s room. a less aggressive quarantine approach may have been as effective in controlling transmission and allowed more staff to be available for work. our observations emphasize the consequences of missing the diagnosis of SARS for even a relatively brief period. the possibility of unexpected exposure of healthcare workers to patients with SARS should be anticipated. vigilant surveillance for symptoms of SARS must be maintained by all healthcare workers who work in institutions with SARS patients."}
