{"summary": "latent EBV infection is intimately linked to some epithelial carcinomas and B-cell lymphomas in both immunocompetent and immunosuppressed hosts. immortalization of primary B-lymphocytes by EBV infection generating lymphoblastoid cell lines is the in vitro assay for assessing EBV immortalizing properties. al cancer nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) has been more enigmatic [6,16]. experiments in epithelial cells demonstrate that LMP1 expression has oncogenic potential. however, low levels of LMP1 may be sufficient to confer oncogenic properties. ing properties of LMP1 have been extensively reviewed. this review will focus on the latest developments on EBV epithelial infection models. it will discuss the implications of LMP1 sequence diversity. the AIDS-associated permissive infection OHL develop in the tongue and oral epithelium. but these remain as lytic lesions and do not develop into carcinomas. the return of OHL lesions after eradication of EBV permissive replication by valacyclovir treatment would support the possible existence of a persistent (perhaps uncleared) oral reservoir. a study uncovered Ephrin A2 as the primary EBV receptor for epithelial cells by deductive reasoning. the authors reasoned that HEK293 and AGS gastric carcinoma cells that are highly susceptible to EBV infection would express a differentially abundant membrane-associated EBV receptor that would be absent from B cells. advancements in developing epithelial cell culture models that produce infectious progeny virus and are amenable to molecular virology. cell lines can be subjected to a variety of molecular virology techniques. immunoblotting, RNA-seq, Southern blotting to differentiate latent fused episomal genomes from linear replicating genomes. titering by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of encapsidated EBV genomes, and scoring for infectious units by the green Raji assay [26,60]. primary oral keratinocyte organotypic raft culture model is unique in that it results in widespread infection. primary epithelial cells polarized on transwell membranes have demonstrated that cell-associated and cell-free virus can enter stratified epithelium via basolateral or apical surfaces. polarization method has historically been used to polarize primary bronchial and nasal epithelial cells for the study of airway pathogens including viruses and biofilms. a limited number of exome and genome sequencing studies have not identified unifying mutations. this suggests that the genetic composition supporting EBV oncogenesis in NPC may be variable, although the affected pathways such as regulators of NFkB signaling may be common. illomavirus (HPV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV) are that EBV genomes are maintained in their natural infectious configuration as extrachromosomal episomes in EBV-associated cancers. this strongly argues that expression of latent transcripts including the heterogenous levels of LMP1 is highly regulated, and that pre-disposition to EBV-mediated oncogenesis cannot simply be explained by unlicensed the subdued and highly regulated levels of LMP1 in NPC tumors are likely reflective of co-evolution with the host cell that is likely selected for at least three criteria including oncogenic, immune evasion and EBV pathogenesis properties. the conserved motifs in CTARs 1, 2 or 3 were extensively characterized for signaling and oncogenic properties. a survey of LMP1 sequence diversity identified that the C-terminus can phylogenetically distinguish at least seven LMP1 variants denoted as LMP1 strains. the study was developed to screen circulating LMP1 strains in oral wash and peripheral blood, as compared to the strains found in EBV-associated tumors and diseases. specific isolates can also be compartmentalized within local and peripheral sites at least for the selection of LMP1 strain variants. asymptomatic carriers also show compartmentalization of LMP1 strain variants with distinct sequences that could be tracked as persistent isolates in the oral cavity. to date, 33 whole EBV genomes derived from NPC tumors have been sequenced and are summarized in Table 1. the genomes listed in Table 1 were derived from NPC patients in the form of an NPC biopsy (GD2, M81, D3201.2, HKNPC1-9, HN1-18), an NPC cell line (C666-1), or saliva from an NPC patient (GD1) the isolate M-ABA harvested from a marmoset lymphoblastoid a phylogenetic tree of LMP1 nucleotide sequences was constructed from assembled EBV genomes. all LCL-derived LMP1 isolates except for AFB1 were derived from spontaneously-immortalized LCLs (sLCLs) from healthy, infectious mononucleosis or post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) donors. LMP1 sequences were derived from NPC patients (blue) or spontaneously immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines (black), which were further grouped by infectious mononucleosis (green) and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (red) one sample was directly sequenced from the saliva of a healthy donor (purple) all LMP1 sequences in the NPC group were typed to be the China1 strain, but the sLCL group consisted of multiple LMP1 strains. conservation plots of the sLCL sub-groups demonstrate that LMP1 amino acid residues are more conserved in the NPC group than the sLCL isolates. only one completed EBV genome from a healthy asymptomatic donor has been sequenced and deposited in the NCBI database. a more robust analysis of the LMP1 sequence diversity found within tumors and among asymptomatic carriers will be possible. cellular and viral determinants have been proposed as potential LMP1 selection mechanisms. -A2 or -A24 alleles are the most frequently typed HLA in NPC patients. serological screens for LMP1 reactivity would argue that LMP1 is not an immunodominant EBV protein but is nevertheless one of the most immunogenic latent proteins expressed in the restricted latency II program in NPCs. the increased expression levels of LMP1 during EBV lytic reactivation may therefore be important in differentiation-induced EBV reactivation in oral stratified epithelium and the disease-associated permissive infection of OHL [23,26,27]. m results in the loss of a XhoI restriction enzyme site located in exon 1 of the LMP1 gene. multiple variants of LMP1 were further defined by three features in the C-terminus. these features did not however co-segregate with EBV type I or type II. strain found in both endemic and non-endemic NPC tumors. detection frequency in up to 80% of endemic NPCs. asymptomatic carriers also show compartmentalization of LMP1 strain variants. TS of EBV Genomes Target enrichment methods have been developed for HTS using PCR-amplified DNA baits or overlapping RNA baits. target enrichment methods can be susceptible to sequence bias from the bait library. alternative method based on modified Hirt extraction protocol successfully applied to the sequencing of replicating EBV genomes from reactivated Akata and Mutu Burkitt lymphoma cell lines. NPC Genome NCBI Accession No. Geographic Region LMP1 Strain (if Known) Source GD1 [96] AY961628 China 1 Saliva GD2 [97] HQ020558 China 1 NPC HKNPC1 [92] JQ009376 Hong Kong 1 NPC C666-1 [90,98] KC617875 China 1 NPC cell line M81 [37] KF373730 Hong Kong 1 NPC D3201.2 [90] L all LCL-derived LMP1 isolates except for AFB1 were derived from spontaneously-immortalized LCLs (sLCLs) from healthy, infectious mononucleosis (blue) or spontaneously immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines (black) one sample was directly sequenced from the saliva of a healthy donor (purple) conservation plots of LMP1 amino acid sequences were grouped by origin (NPC vs. sLCL) and analyzed against a master consensus sequence generated from the combined NPC and sLCL sequences. coding sequence is relatively well conserved in NPC isolates but is more diverse in sLCL isolates. conservation plots were generated in CLC Main Workbench 6 and compared to a consensus sequence. consensus sequence was generated from the combined sequences of NPC and sLCL samples by majority with no gaps. only one completed EBV genome from the saliva of a healthy asymptomatic donor has been sequenced and deposited in the NCBI database. many, but not all, of the known and predicted HLA-A24 restricted epitopes on LMP1 were also mutated in the China1 variant. many of the computer-predicted HLA-A24 restricted epitopes on LMP1 were also mutated in the China1 sequence. -A2 or -A24 alleles are the most frequently typed HLA in NPC patients. there has been no consensus on a clear difference that distinguishes the onogenic properties of the China1 strain or the closely related CAO variant. however, it remains possible that LMP1 sequence polymorphisms outside the regions defining LMP1 strains may indeed differ in biological properties. elucidating its effects on the life cycle of EBV is from elucidating its effects on the life cycle of EBV. LMP1 signals from lipid raft microdomains and recruits TNF-receptor associated factors (TRAF 2/3/5/6) and TRADD molecules. somewhat unprecedented, even integral membrane proteins induced by LMP1 and elevated in NPC can translocate into the nucleus. deletion of LMP1 promotes the retention of EBV genomes in latently-infected cells. native expression of LMP1 contributes to EBV lytic reactivation in differentiating epithelial cells and immortalized keratinocytes [26,27]. Historically, only a handful of LMP1 interactions have been identified by yeast-2-hybrid, affinity-purification, and biomolecular fluorescence complementation. biochemical fractionation of cellular compartments has also generated some evidence that LMP1 fractionates in the nucleus. it may be the result of contaminating endoplasmic reticulum that can co-purify with the nuclear fraction. a subset of LMP1 molecules may shuttle into the nucleus via the nuclear envelope. many proteins which directly or indirectly bind to LMP1 are found in exosomes. it is proposed that LMP1 hijacks protein trafficking and exosome biogenesis pathways. crosstalk between endosomal and autophagosomal pathways can fine tune levels of LMP1-induced intracellular signaling including activated mTOR. exosomes are stable particles (100 nm) circulating in biofluids. exosomes are protected from enzymatic degradation and can be harvested from serum, saliva, and urine. exosomes may have the potential to be developed as non-invasive biomarkers. studies on LMP1 have shown that LMP1 can directly trigger EMT by inducing two of the four major EMT transcriptional regulators. fibronectin over-expression in NPC correlates with LMP1 expression. the coding sequence of LMP1 has no overall sequence identity or homology to hosts or other viral proteins. the coding sequence of LMP1 has no overall sequence identity or homology to hosts or other viral proteins. the coding sequence of LMP1 has no overall sequence identity or homology. LMP1 co-expressed with LMP2A modulates the DNA damage signaling protein H2AX. native expression of LMP1 contributes to EBV lytic reactivation in differentiating epithelial cells and immortalized keratinocytes. nuclear proteins were also identified which could include proteins that shuttle between the cytosol and the nucleus. it is possible that some of these potential nuclear partners engage LMP1 in the cytosol and then shuttle into the nucleus via the nuclear envelope which is contiguous with the endoplasmic reticulum. many proteins which directly or indirectly bind to LMP1 are found in exosomes or are known to play a role in exosome biogenesis and protein trafficking. it is proposed that LMP1 hijacks protein trafficking and exosome biogenesis pathways. crosstalk between endosomal and autophagosomal pathways can fine tune levels of LMP1-induced intracellular signaling including activated mTOR. exosomes from epithelial cells can also deliver immunosuppressive cargo such as galectin 9 to disarm EBV-specific T cells that abundantly infiltrate NPC tumors. the findings would offer one mechanism by which LMP1 hijacks the EV sorting machinery to mediate intercellular communication and immune suppression in the local tumor microenvironment. exosomes are stable particles (100 nm) circulating in biofluids, carrying protein and transcripts of host pakoglobin, also known as -catenin, is a component of adherens junctions and desmosomes, whose downregulation is associated with enhanced migration. fibronectin over-expression in NPC correlates with LMP1 expression in NPC. the biological consequence of all these LMP1-modulated interactions is likely to control cellular motility, invasiveness and trigger outside-in signaling. the biological consequence of all these LMP1-modulated interactions is likely to control cellular motility, invasiveness and trigger outside-in signaling. crosstalk between endosomal and autophagosomal pathways can fine tune the levels of LMP1-induced intracellular signaling including activated mTOR. LMP1 alters the cargo and the production of exosomes, which are thought to communicate with neighboring recipient cells in the NPC microenvironment [136,137,138,140,142,144]. exosomes are stable particles (100 nm) circulating in biofluids. exosomes are protected from enzymatic degradation and can be harvested from serum, saliva, and urine. exosomes may have potential to be developed as non-invasive biomarkers. studies on LMP1 have shown that LMP1 can directly trigger EMT by inducing two of the four major EMT transcriptional regulators. fibronectin over-expression in NPC correlates with LMP1 expression. recent advances in epithelial infection and polarized culture models are likely the key to fully appreciating the contribution of LMP1 to NPC pathogenesis. a recent study in HPV identified striking sequence conservation in the HPV E7 oncoprotein in high-risk HPV strains."}
