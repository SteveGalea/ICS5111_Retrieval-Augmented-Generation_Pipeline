{"summary": "five study centers were included: Northwestern University (Chicago, IL), Mount Sinai Hospital (Toronto, ON, Canada), North York General Hospital (Toronto, ON, Canada), Royal Adelaide Hospital (Adelaide, Australia), and Westmead Hospital (Westmead, Australia). written informed consent was obtained from all patients. the swab and the transport medium were vigorously agitated on a vortex mixer. the fluid was released by grabbing the end of the swab-stick and squeezing the tip against the inner wall of the vial or tube. the samples were sent to 1 location where all subsequent analyses were performed. the lowest extrapolated quantity that could be measured was 3.25 log10 copies/mL. samples with an influenza VL below LLOQ were extrapolated. the lowest extrapolated quantity that could be measured was 3.25 log10 copies/mL. each sample was tested in 8 replicates and 11 dilutions (1 sample/96-well plate) the MDCK cells were seeded (on day 1) at a concentration of 10 000 cells/100 L growth medium per well in a 96-well plate. plates were incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. only infection medium was added to column 12 (negative control column) log10 TCID50/mL value was calculated in a template based upon the Reed-Muench method [27] to determine the amount of infectious influenza A virus during hospitalization, TCID50 values were measured on the baseline and follow-up NP samples. 8 samples (2 subjects) still had fungi contamination and were therefore invalid. influenza-like illness (ILI), suspected respiratory infection (pneumonia and other respiratory infection), acute respiratory failure (eg chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation, asthma exacerbation), or fever were eligible for this study. patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza were screened with PCR. RNA Copy Number of the Influenza Viruses Nucleic acids were extracted from 100 L NP sample using the EasyMAG extraction platform (BioM\u00e9rieux) the RNA was eluted in 100 L and stored at 80\u00b0C. s with an influenza VL below LLOQ were extrapolated. the lowest extrapolated quantity that could be measured was 3.25 log10 copies/mL. the RNA extraction and PCR conditions were identical to the influenza A RT-qPCR protocol. the cells were seeded (on day 1) at a concentration of 10 000 cells/100 L growth medium per well in a 96-well plate (column 1\u201312) plates were incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. only infection medium was added to column 12 (negative control column) TCID50 values were measured on the baseline and follow-up NP samples. 8 samples (2 subjects) still had fungi contamination and were invalid. the highest observed VL was 9.82 log10 copies/mL. the average (standard error) number of days until the VL reached the detection limit was 7.58 0.35 days since enrollment. the insert table represents the amount of samples in the different categories. of the 433 samples, 325 were left-censored for TCID50 with a detection limit of 2.2 log10 TCID50/mL (range up to 7.5 log10 TCID50/mL) the mean log10 TCID50 for baseline samples was 1.80 (95% CI, 1.25\u20132.35; n = 134, 78 of which were left-censored) the relative infectivity of TCID50/VL changed significantly with 0.25 0.09 units per day (P =.0069) for an average patient, the TCID50 decays faster than the VL. for a 12-day observation period, the decay corresponds to a decline in relative infectivity of 3 log10 viral RNA copies. the highest observed VL was 9.82 log10 copies/mL. the average (standard error) number of days until the VL reached the detection limit was 7.58 0.35 days since enrollment. the mean log10 TCID50 for baseline samples was 1.80 (95% CI, 1.25\u20132.35; n = 134, 78 of which were left-censored) the average number of days until TCID50/mL reached the detection limit was 3.49 0.38 days since enrollment. the correlation between log10 VL and log10 TCID50 was estimated to be 0.87 (95% CI,.84\u2013.90) for a 12-day observation period, the decay corresponds to a decline in relative infectivity of 3 log10 viral RNA copies. thus, the data document a significant decline of the relative infectivity of influenza A virus particles. this result is observed irrespective of the investigational site, subtype, or the presence of a coinfection. a high percentage of samples (n = 215) have levels of viral RNA in the absence of cultivable virus in the NP swabs despite proper sampling handling. it is important to include the percentage of infectious viral particles in virological measurements used in clinical studies of antiviral agents. RNA copy numbers and viral infectious titer patterns showed a downward trend of the log ratio of TCID50/VL of the influenza viruses. this ratio is less affected by sampling variability, but could be very useful in determining efficacy of new antiviral compounds."}
