{"summary": "epidemics of new influenza variants, novel coronaviruses and enteroviruses, new strains of Ebola virus and new strains of Chikungunya have created significant concerns in healthcare. globalization of tourism and business have further complicated disease epidemiology that may have once been more localized but now poses greater potential for international spread. the recent outbreaks were associated with porcine and avian exposure as a risk for infection. introduction of a pathogen into new regions may alter the epidemiology of disease. MERS-CoV represented a new viral entity related to other minimally pathogenic coronaviruses. the mortality rate of early MERS-CoV cases was approximately 60%,3 and has remained greater than 35%. a businessman returning from the Middle East served as the index case for 185 subsequent cases of MERS-CoV. the emergence of MERS-CoV as a novel human pathogen has 2 remaining mysteries. the genetic alterations that have allowed a virus such as HKU4 to become a lower respiratory pathogen of high mortality is unknown. dromedary camels in the Arabian Peninsula27-30 and North Africa31 are seropositive or actively shedding virus. greater than 90% of dromedary camels in the Arabian Peninsula27-30 and North Africa31 are seropositive or actively shedding virus. the global trade in exotic animals such as palm civets served as the vector for transmission of SARS-CoV. the magnitude of MERS-CoV viral load in nasopharyngeal secretions46 and blood47 has been directly correlated with higher mortality in some studies. the utility of upper respiratory samples is, however, not clear since MERS-CoV is a lower respiratory tract pathogen and the viral load in lower respiratory samples has minimal correlation to the risk of death. the role for neutralizing antibodies in MERS-CoV disease outcomes is not established. one could question whether subclinical or non-lethal infection provides long-term immunity against recurrent MERS-CoV infection. protein based vaccines included both RBD subunit vaccine62-64,62,63 and a trimeric, full-length S protein nanoparticle. only one DNA vaccine, GLS-5300, has progressed into human clinical trials. clinical trials Gov. 4 GLS-5300 is being co-developed by GeneOne Life Science, Inc. and Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 5 The indicated studies have completed enrollment. lack of an ideal animal model for MERS-CoV has served as a further impediment in vaccine development. single large outbreak in Seoul Korea, there has been minimal transmission of MERS-CoV outside of Saudi Arabia. vigilance in maintaining strict infection control procedures has significantly reduced new cases among healthcare workers (HCWs) nor have there been additional outbreaks outside of the Arabian Peninsula akin to the Korean epidemic of September 2015. studies in risk-groups could be stratified between those with or without documented MERS-CoV immune responses. a third clinical trial design could focus on those at highest risk for severe infection. any MERS-CoV vaccine has a key challenge as to the ability to conduct a definitive efficacy trial. the mortality rate of early MERS-CoV cases was approximately 60%,3 and has remained greater than 35% -approximating that seen during the west African Ebola virus outbreak. a businessman returning from the Middle East to Seoul Korea served as the index case for 185 subsequent cases. the emergence of MERS-CoV as a novel human pathogen has 2 remaining mysteries. the genetic alterations that have allowed a virus such as a group B coronavirus, MERS-CoV is considered to be of bat origin. the emergence of MERS-CoV as a novel human pathogen has 2 remaining mysteries. KU4 causes a mild, self-limited upper respiratory infection to become a lower respiratory pathogen of high mortality is unknown. if early transfer to camels occurred that provided the necessary reservoir and amplification is unknown. dromedary camels in the Arabian Peninsula27-30 and North Africa31 are seropositive or actively shedding virus - that suggests a high level of susceptibility to infection. mice expressing human DPP4 driven from surfactant promoters develop mild, transient disease. adenoviral-associated vectors that express human DPP444 develop a self-limited upper respiratory infection different from human infection. a study of 17 patients showed no clear difference in the pattern or timing of binding antibody development between those with severe vs. non-severe disease. notably only 2 patients did not develop neutralizing antibodies greater than 1:20. vaccine candidates include adenoviral associated vectors based on chimpanzee serotype 1 and human serotype 559; poxvirus vectors based on the modified vaccinia Ankara strain60; and an attenuated measles virus vector. 3 Date entered into Clinical Trials Gov. 4 GLS-5300 is being co-developed by GeneOne Life Science, Inc. and Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 5 The indicated studies have completed enrollment. lack of an ideal animal model for MERS-CoV has served as a further impediment in vaccine development. MERS-CoV remains endemic in Saudi Arabia with approximately 20\u201330 cases diagnosed monthly. vigilance in maintaining strict infection control procedures has significantly reduced new cases among healthcare workers (HCWs) nor have there been additional outbreaks outside of the Arabian Peninsula akin to the Korean epidemic of September 2015. studies in risk-groups could be stratified between those with or without documented MERS-CoV immune responses. a third clinical trial design could focus on those at highest risk for severe infection. any MERS-CoV vaccine has a key challenge as to the ability to conduct a definitive efficacy trial. Zika virus was discovered in 1947 as part of a study to map the geographic extent of Yellow Fever virus in Uganda. at the time of discovery, Zika was prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa and tropical Asia with seroprevalence rates as high as 60% in some regions. in 2014, a Zika outbreak in French Polynesia lasting only 4 months resulted in approximately 9,000 diagnosed cases. Zika virus is neurotropic, a link made as early as 1971 in mice. in adults, Zika virus can cause Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) with an attack rate estimated as almost 1 in 5,000 cases of infection. infection in young mice causes testicular infection that results in testicular atrophy and infertility. a more ominous complication in mice is that infection in young mice causes direct testicular infection that results in testicular atrophy and infertility. Zika has been shown to downregulate type 1 interferon (IFN) response of dendritic cells through impairment of phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2117. others found that the Zika NS5 protein results in proteasomal degradation of STAT2 in 293T cells118. the question of whether prior immunity against DENV can provide cross protection against Zika virus or enhance Zika virus infection is not yet resolved. 132,133,136 Importantly, clinical correlates of cross-flavivirus ADE are so far lacking. at present, correlates of protection that would relate to vaccine development have not been determined. goal would be to prevent infection before establishment of viral reservoirs in the CNS, lymph nodes, or even testes. 109 vaccine candidates in development include live-attenuated viral vaccines, live chimeric vaccines, purified inactivated (killed) vaccines. viral vectored vaccines based on measles, adeno-associated virus (AAV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and vaccinia platforms. pre-clinical data for one PIV vaccine, an attenuated live-virus vaccine, 3 DNA vaccines, NIAID 50 OL MD 7 NCT02996461 16 Dec 2016 140,141,143 mRNA mRNA-1325 Moderna 90 OL, DR CA, FL, IL 7 NCT03014089 5 Jan 2017 Jan 2017 146 PIV ZPIV 5 Beth Israel 48 DR, PC, DB MA 7 NCT02937233 12 Oct 2016 Oct 2016 140,143 NIAID 75 OL, DR MO 7 NCT02952833 13 Oct 2016 NIAID two trials, DNA vaccine GLS-5700 and ZPIV, have begun enrollment in a Zika endemic region. ADE is an in vitro phenomenon initially documented for dengue virus123,148 that has been observed for all flaviviruses including Zika. there is no epidemiologic data to suggest that the current Zika virus epidemic has increased the risk for DHF. one study in pregnant females showed no evidence of differences in disease severity related to prior DENV seropositivity137. other studies have shown that prior DENV serotype I infection may be associated with increased neutralizing antibody titers134. the safety of viral vectored and live-attenuated vaccines is unknown in pregnancy. additional target populations are those traveling to endemic regions or those living in regions where Aedes species mosquitoes, especially Ae. aegypti, are endemic. Zika virus is transmitted transovarially, i.e. vertically across mosquito generations. in adults, Zika virus can cause Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. the perceived absence of microcephaly during the french polynesian outbreak was resolved when a retrospective study found a prevalence of microcephaly of 1\u20132% for infants born to mothers infected during pregnancy. however, a recent study has estimated that up to 30% of infants of women infected at the end of the 1st trimester may be affected. Zika virus viremia typically lasts 1\u20132 weeks whereas Zika can be detected in the urine for up to 4 weeks. sensitivity of detection by PCR is considered the \u201cgold standard\u201d to determine acute illness in clinical trials. ulate the innate immune system gains importance especially with regard to neurologic and testicular infection. despite the presence of neutralizing antibodies, Zika persists in the lymph nodes and central nervous system for 1.5 to 2.5 months. et al. in a primate study from 1970 demonstrated cross protection for animals infected with one flavivirus and challenged with a second, different flavivirus127. in vitro ADE has also been demonstrated for Zika virus by the presence of flavivirus antibodies against the DENV and/or West Nile virus. vaccines in development include live-attenuated viral vaccines, live chimeric vaccines, purified inactivated (killed) vaccines, viral vectored vaccines based on measles, adeno-associated virus (AAV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and vaccinia platforms. vaccine candidates include live-attenuated viral vaccines, live chimeric vaccines, purified inactivated (killed three DNA vaccines, an mRNA vaccine, and a PIV vaccine have advanced into Phase I clinical trials (Table 3). Zika virus vaccines: published pre-clinical studies and Phase I clinical trials. VRC5283 is a chimeric vaccine that includes the JEV prM region preceding the entire wild-type Zika virus envelope. chimeric vaccine includes the JEV prM region preceding the first 98 amino acids of the Zika virus envelope and the stem and transmembrane regions. ADE is an in vitro phenomenon initially documented for dengue virus123,148 that has been observed for all flaviviruses including Zika. prospective clinical studies have not demonstrated a correlation between the presence of enhancing antibodies in pre-infection serum and more severe dengue virus infections. vaccine development has been driven primarily from the desire to prevent congenital infection for women who become infected during pregnancy. secondary targets are the prevention of other neurologic complications such as GBS and possibly the prevention of infection of males to prevent testicular damage. MERS-CoV appears to represent a novel genetic variant of the minimally pathogenic HNK4 bat coronavirus. but questions remain as to why one strain has a mortality of 35\u201340% and the other causes self-limited upper respiratory illness. both illnesses are characterized by a changing epidemiology such that the time that a vaccine candidate entered into clinical trials, the incidence of disease had significantly declined. the current endemic rate of incident infections, with few cases in any one region creates significant challenges, i.e., potentially requiring a large number of participants to demonstrate efficacy. the staff of GeneOne Life Science and VGXI are gratefully acknowledged for their support and assistance."}
