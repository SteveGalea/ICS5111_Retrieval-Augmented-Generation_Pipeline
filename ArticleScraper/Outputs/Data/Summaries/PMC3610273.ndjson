{"summary": "human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are a well-known cause of respiratory infections but their role in gastrointestinal infections is unclear. the aim of our study was to assess the significance of HCoVs in the etiology of acute gastroenteritis. human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been recognized as a frequent cause of mild respiratory tract infections (RTIs) and occasionally as a potential cause of severe lower RTI in premature infants and children with underlying diseases. a dual enteric and respiratory tropism has been reported for the bovine coronavirus causing winter dysentery in calves. 765 children 6 years of age were referred to the department of infectious disease with the diagnosis of AGE. of them 260 were enrolled in the study. the others did not meet inclusion criteria for AGE (250 children) HCoVs were more often detected in NP swabs than in stool samples. four of six (67%, 95% CI 22\u201396%) children with HCoV-positive stool samples had symptoms of respiratory and gastrointestinal infection. 95% CI 21\u201364%) 87/234 (3.2%, CI 31-44%) 1/5, (20%. 95% CI 0.5\u201372%) AGE + RTI 4/6 (66.7%, 95% CI 22\u201396%) 156/254 (61.4%, 95% CI: 55-67%) 13/22 (59%, 95% CI 36\u201379%) 147/234 (62.8%, 95 CI 56-69%) 4/5, (80%, 95% viruses in stool samples HCoV species in NP swab Follow up NP swab 1 AGE + RTI OC43 neg neg neg HKU1* 2 AGE + RTI OC43 Norovirus OC43 neg neg neg neg 3 AGE + RTI OC43 Rotavirus, AdV OC43 AdV OC43, AdV 4 AGE + RTI NL63 Rotavirus NL63, hRV, PIV neg HKU 23 AGE neg Rotavirus 229E neg neg neg Key: *RTI, respiratory tract infection; **AGE, acute gastroenteritis; **AGE, acute gastroenteritis; OC43; human coronavirus OC43; NL63; human coronavirus NL63; 229E; human coronavirus NL63; adenovirus; hRV, rinovirus; SRV, small round viruses; SRV, parainfluen in 10 of 15 positive children, HCoVs were demonstrated only in the follow-up sample. in five children the presence of HCoVs was established in the first and follow-up NP swab. none of the 38 samples from 33 children positive for HCoVs in NP swabs and/or stool sample had viruses detected in blood sample taken simultaneously. 765 children 6 years of age were referred to the department of infectious disease with the diagnosis of AGE. of them 260 were enrolled in the study; the others did not meet inclusion criteria for AGE. the median age of included children was 18.9 months. HCoVs were more often detected in NP swabs than in stool samples. in two (33.3%) stool samples HCoV was detected as a single pathogen. in four samples the presence of other viruses was also established. 9/22 (41%, 95% CI 21\u201364%) 87/234 (3.2%, CI 31-44%) 1/5, (20%. 95% CI 0.5\u201372%) AGE + RTI 4/6 (66.7%, 95% CI 22\u201396%) 156/254 (61.4%, 95% CI: 55-67%) 13/22 (59%, 95% CI 36\u201379%) 147/234 (62.8%, 95 CI 56-69%) 4/5 clinical signs HCoVs species in stool samples Other viruses in stool samples Follow up stool sample Follow up NP swab 1 AGE + RTI OC43 neg OC43 neg neg neg HKU1* 2 AGE + RTI OC43 Norovirus OC43 neg neg neg neg neg 3 AGE + RTI OC43 Rotavirus, AdV OC43 AdV OC43, AdV 4 AGE + RTI NL63 Rotavirus NL63, h HCoVs were detected as a single viral pathogen in NP swab in 8/9 (88.9%) children with AGE as the only clinical sign. HCoVs were not detected in any of 183 follow-up NP swabs. in 10 of 15 positive children, HCoVs were demonstrated only in the follow-up sample. in five children the presence of HCoVs was established in the first and follow-up NP swab. at the time of follow-up testing, 1/15 children with HCoV-positive NP swab had gastrointestinal signs/symptoms. HCoVs are recognized as causes of respiratory infections but their role in gastrointestinal infections has not been clarified. in the patients with AGE, follow-up sampling was performed 14 days after the initial testing. the higher probability of HCoV detection in the stool samples of patients with AGE than among controls. the course of the events in HCoVs infection might have been similar to those known to be operative in animals. however, we tested all patients with HCoVs found in stool samples or NP swabs for the presence of the viruses in blood but did not get any positive result. viremia usually results in the involvement of the lower RTI. HCoVs were detected as a single viral pathogen in 8/9 (88.9%) NP swabs from children with AGE without concomitant respiratory symptoms. more than half of children with AGE also had respiratory symptoms at the time of sampling. only 5/15 (33.3%) children had been positive for HCoVs in the first sample. the last finding suggests that the persistence of HCoVs in NP swabs is associated with positivity of both samples (NP swabs and stools) during acute illness. children in this age group who had been admitted to the department of Infectious Diseases of the University Medical Centre Ljubljana, from October 2009 to September 2011 were eligible for the study. only children without infections in last four weeks preceding the surgery were eligible for surgery admission. NP swabs were collected using flocked-tip swabs. 5 L of Equine herpesvirus 1 and 5 L of Equine arthritis virus isolates were added to all samples. nucleic acids were extracted using total nucleic acid isolation kits. NP swabs respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza viruses A and B (Flu A-B), parainfluenza viruses 1\u20133 (PIV 1\u20133), metapneumovirus (hMPV), human bocavirus (HBoVs), adenovirus (AdV) and rhinovirus (hRV) were searched for by real-time RT-PCR. study was a part of a prospective study on viral respiratory and gastrointestinal infections in children 6 years. children in this age group who had been admitted to the department of Infectious Diseases of the University Medical Centre Ljubljana, from October 2009 to September 2011 were eligible for the study. NP swabs were collected using flocked-tip swabs and transported to the laboratory in the Copan universal transport medium (UTM-RT) system. nucleic acids were extracted using total nucleic acid isolation kits on a MagNa Pure Compact instrument. a one-step real-time RT\u2013PCR assay was used in a StepOne Real-Time PCR system. 5 L of nucleic acid was added to 15 L of reaction mixture. NP swabs respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza viruses A and B (Flu A-B), parainfluenza viruses 1\u20133 (PIV 1\u20133), metapneumovirus (hMPV), human bocavirus (HBoVs Statistical analysis Data are reported as the frequency (percentage) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for proportions obtained using exact binomial tail areas. McNemar\u2019s test was used to compare the frequency of HCoV positivity."}
