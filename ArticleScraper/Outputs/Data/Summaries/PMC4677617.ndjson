{"summary": "the outbreak investigation survey was designed based on a similar survey conducted in the united states (3). records of movements were compiled for animals, humans, feed, equipment, and other potential fomites moving on and off the farm during the 2-week period prior to the onset of clinical signs of disease. in 3 of the 28 cases there was no response to requests for an interview. average number of sites within 3 km (n = 22) 2.5 Average preweaning mortality in the last 90 days (n = 16) 10.8% Average mortality in nursery unit (n = 11) 3.8% Average mortality in grower/finisher unit (n = 11) 1.8% Pigs sourced from a sow farm confirmed positive for PED (n = 20) Yes 1 (0.05) No 19 (0.95) Swine remaining on site have recovered (n = 24) Yes 6 (0.25) No 18 (0.75) Average number the outbreak affected farms across a widespread area and within many counties in Ontario. the largest number of cases was reported in Bruce, Huron, Middlesex, Oxford, and Perth counties. cases were significantly clustered in relation to controls to the 1st and 4th nearest neighbor. st nearest neighbor 2.932 0.030 S 2nd nearest neighbor 2.911 0.201 NS 3rd nearest neighbor 3.055 0.204 NS 4th nearest neighbor 4.034 0.031 S 5th nearest neighbor 4.137 0.237 NS Statistical Distance Test 5.704 0.009 S Modified Cusum 2014-02-15 1.456 0.459 NS 2014-02-07 0.450 0.995 NS 2014-02-04 0.447 0.998 NS S \u2014 Not significant a follow-up survey was conducted approximately 1 mo after the onset of clinical signs to determine the clinical progression of and recovery from disease. fifteen producers were questioned about clinical signs in their affected herd and the date on which they thought their herd had recovered from the disease. the average duration of illness was 19 d, although 3 producers reported ongoing effects from the outbreak. most of the first 28 cases were farrow-to-finish farms, while the last 35 were predominantly finisher farms. this could be attributed to a different type of exposure, previously infected animals moving through the production system, breaches in on-farm biosecurity. trailers were swabbed using a cloth soaked in a 90% saline/10% propylene glycol solution. only 7.5% of 1555 trailers tested had samples positive for PEDV. producers who shipped hogs on contaminated trailers were contacted and on follow-up testing 3 farms were diagnosed with PEDV. the feed tested positive on RT-PCR testing for transmissible gastroenteritis virus, porcine respiratory coronavirus and the North American strain of porcine reproductive and respiratory virus. both the SDPP and the feed contained PEDV genetic material, as determined by RT-PCR (10) the feed also tested positive on RT-PCR testing for transmissible gastroenteritis virus, porcine respiratory coronavirus and the North American strain of porcine reproductive and respiratory virus. PEDV affected many farms over a widespread area in Ontario without significant temporal clustering. disease caused high morbidity and mortality in nursing piglets and had less impact on older animals."}
