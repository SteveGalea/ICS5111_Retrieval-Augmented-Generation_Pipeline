{"summary": "positive sense RNA viruses rely heavily on host cell factors for all aspects of their life cycle. they replicate on host derived membranous vesicles that are induced following viral infection. translation of the viral genome and the synthesis of new viral RNA occurs in a highly coordinated process. aV are enteropathogenic members of the Caliciviridae family of positive sense RNA viruses, and together cause >20% of all cases of gastroenteritis. they are also a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the immunocompromised; individuals with genetic immune-deficiencies, cancer patients undergoing treatment and transplant recipients often experience chronic norovirus infections lasting months to years. we identify the host protein G3BP1 as a critical host factor required for norovirus VPg-dependent translation. the protein is covalently linked to the viral genome via the highly conserved tyrosine residue within an N-terminal DEEYD/E motif. the NV VPg proteins contain a highly conserved C-terminal domain which we have shown to be sufficient for binding to the translation initiation factor eIF4G. NV VPg proteins into 293 T cells allowed for affinity purification of eIF4F components. mutations in eIF4G binding domain of VPg reduced this association. m7-GTP sepharose was used to affinity purify eIF4F. quantitative proteomics was used as described in the text to identify host factors that were affinity purified following transfection of either the NV or MNV VPg proteins. proteins specifically enriched on the murine norovirus or human norovirus (Norwalk) VPg proteins in comparison to the GFP control are shown in panels A and B respectively. rometry of the affinity purified complexes isolated from cells transfected with the GFP-Tagged VPg proteins to identify host factors specifically enriched on the norovirus VPg protein. most of the proteins identified were components of the host cell translation complex including ribosomal proteins, translation initiation factors and host RNA binding proteins. these data agree with but significantly extend our previous observations using a less sensitive multi-step affinity purification approach. unlabelled or stable isotope labelled highly permissive BV2 microglial cells were infected with either wild type MNV or the equivalent virus carrying the FLAG epitope purification tag. the experiment was performed three times by swapping the derivatives of arginine and lysine as described in the Materials and methods. NS1/2-FLAG and NS4-FLAG viruses contain insertions of nucleotide sequences encoding the FLAG peptide DYKDDDDK in their coding sequences. BV2 cells labelled with stable derivatives of arginine and lysine were infected with either wild type MNV (WT) or recombinant epitope-tagged MNV. all MNV proteins were identified in association with NS1/2 and NS4 (light blue) including the viral polymerase NS7. proteins previously identified as host factors potentially involved in some aspect of the norovirus life cycle through various biochemical or genetic screens are shown in red. the greatest overlap between VPg and the replication complex proteome data was observed between NS1/2 and NS1/2. the baits NS1/2 and NS4 both enriched VPg during replication complex pulldowns, but NS1/2 also enriched the VPg binding partner eIF4G. ontology analysis indicated that proteins involved in vesicle transport and fatty acid metabolism were significantly enriched (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1 and Supplementary file 3), fitting with previous observations that the viral replication complex is associated with cytoplasmic membranous structures. we noted that the VapA and the paralogue VapB were both highly enriched. most host factors identified using VPg were enriched by >2 fold using only the NS1/2 tagged virus, and not the NS4-tagged virus. one protein was enriched by VPg, NS1/2, and NS4 \u2013 the core stress granule protein G3BP1 (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2). Identification of host factors required for norovirus infection using a CRISPR- knockout screen. genes that were enriched by STARS analysis following MNV infection represent putative pro-viral factors which when disrupted, resulting in slower cell death. those with a negative STARS value represent putative anti-viral factors where virus-induced cell death has occurred quicker. 212 genes were enriched and 42 were negatively selected respectively. 89 common pro-viral hits for CW3 and 8 for CR6, of which only four were common for both strains across all screens. mRNA processing, RNA splicing and methylation are the most highly represented gene ontology terms. PTBP1 is a protein we have previously shown to bind to a 3\u2019 pyrimidine-rich stretch in the MNV genome. the interaction of PTBP1 with the viral 3\u2019 end also facilitates the recruitment of PTBP1 to the viral replication complex where it contributes to an as yet undefined aspect of the norovirus life cycle. the ability of encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) to infect and cause cell death was unaffected by the deletion of G3BP1 (Figure 4C and D). these data confirm that cells lacking G3BP1 are highly resistant to norovirus infection. BP1 on human norovirus replication in cell culture using the norwalk virus replicon. the presence of VPg on the 5\u2019 end of the norwalk RNA was essential for the replication of the replicon RNA and for the capacity to form G418 resistant colonies. transfection of replicon RNA into wild type U2OS osteosarcoma cells allowed the formation of replicon-containing colonies. NV VPg-linked RNA isolated from BHK-NV cells was either mock treated or treated with proteinase K prior to transfection into BHK cells. wells were transfected with either 1.5 g or 0.75 g of total RNA isolated from NV replicon containing BHK cells. surviving colonies were stained 12 days post transfection. the RNA-binding domain of G3BP1 is required for its function in the norovirus life cycle. a mouse BV2 G3BP1 knockout cell line was complemented with either full length G3BP1 or variants lacking the RGG or both the RGG and RRM binding domains. the impact on viral replication assessed. WT or G3BP1 cells complemented with indicated constructs were infected with MNV at an MOI of 10 TCID50 per cell. after 24 hr the virus yield was determined by TCID50. error bars represent the standard error of three independent repeats. a minor increase in viral infectivity was observed in the G3BP1 cell line reconstituted with the RGG construct producing viral titres that were higher than those obtained from the WT complemented line in the presence of 2CMC. however, the levels of viral proteins produced in this line was below the limit of detection by western blot. the production of viral positive sense RNA was reduced to background levels in the absence of G3BP1. the production of viral positive sense RNA was reduced to background levels in the absence of G3BP1. the lack of G3BP1 results in a failure to produce viral negative sense RNA. error bars represent standard error of three biological repeats. similar results were obtained following transfection of viral RNA into cells to bypass the entry phase. the interaction between the eIF4G domain and the eIF3 complex plays a central role in the recruitment of the 40S ribosomal subunit for translation initiation. it has been established previously that G3BP1 associates with 40S subunits. osomal proteins associated with the tagged VPg in this assay are relatively low. eIF4A protein binds directly to the 5\u2019 end of the sapovirus genome. eIF4G is known to make secondary stabilising interactions with the template RNA that are critical for translation initiation. eIF4G is known to make secondary stabilising interactions with the template RNA that are critical for translation initiation. BV2 cells were transfected with the relevant constructs, lysates prepared and GFP-Trap pull downs performed as detailed in the text. mutants in the eIF4G binding domain ablate the association of VPg with eIF4G and ribosomal subunits. GFP-Trap pull down was performed following transfection of tagged derivatives of either a WT or a F123 MNV VPg proteins into WT BV2 cells, G3BP1 BV2 cells or G3BP1 BV2 cells engineered to express Flag tagged derivative of WT G3BP1. samples of the input and purified complexes were analysed by western blot. the fact we observed 80S accumulation in WT cells, but not in cells lacking G3BP1, indirectly lead us to suspect that translation of viral RNA had occurred in WT cells, but was much less efficient in cells lacking G3BP1. ribosome-associated norovirus RNA in WT cells was found in polysomes containing fractions, but less viral RNA was found in ribosome-containing fractions. RNA levels across the gradient are expressed as described in panel B. error bars represent standard error of three technical repeats. cytoplasmic translationally competent extracts were prepared from WT and G3BP1 cell lines. translation profile of purified viral RNA was further analysed by translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysates. we found that norovirus VPg-dependent translation was reduced in nuclease treated extracts prepared from cells lacking G3BP. translation of viral RNA in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (RRL) was used as a side by side comparison. levels of viral translation is expressed as a percentage relative to the same protein product translated in extracts prepared from WT cells. viral VPg-linked RNA in rabbit reticulocyte lysates demonstrated robust translation and the production of a protein profile indistinguishable from in vitro transcribed capped genomic RNA (cap-g) the translation of VP1 and VP2 proteins in extracts from G3BP1 cells is reduced across multiple time points. eIF4E cap-binding protein, the eIF4A helicase and the eIF4GI scaffold protein were readily purified on m7-GTP sepharose. the NS3 protein, known to have RNA binding and helicase activity, was not. transfection of GFP-tagged versions of either the MNV or NV VPg proteins into 293 T cells allowed for the affinity purification of eIF4F components. fusion proteins were transfected into human 293 T cells and subjected to immunoaffinity purification using anti-GFP. samples of the input lysates (Input) and the purified complexes (GFP-IP) were then separated by SDS-PAGE and analysed by western blot analysis. panel C illustrates the proteins previously found to interact with the 5\u2019 or 3\u2019 termini of the MNV genome. we then used quantitative mass spectrometry of the affinity purified complexes isolated from cells transfected with the GFP-Tagged VPg proteins to identify host factors specifically enriched on the VPg protein. western blot analysis of complexes purified from cells transfected with either the WT or eIF4G-binding mutants. the association of all proteins tested was reduced by the introduction of eIF4G-binding site mutations into the MNV VPg protein. complexes purified from NS1/2-Flag virus infected cells co-purified untagged NS4 and vice versa. western blot analysis of the purified complexes confirmed that viral non-structural and structural proteins were specifically enriched in the purified complexes. anti-NS4 monoclonal antibody was unable to detect protein in the extracts prior to enrichment. Western blot analysis of lysates purified from cells infected with NS1/2 and NS4 flag expressing viruses. proteins identified in at least two of the three biological repeats are shown. SILAC ratios were calculated as an average of two or three biological samples. novel putative MNV host factors highly enriched by NS1/2 and NS4 are plotted in black. proteins identified in pulldowns of NS1/2 and NS4 which were also identified using CRISPR screening as MNV host factors are plotted in red. gene ontology analysis of proteins enriched by VPg and NS1/2 during infection using PANTHER overrepresentation analysis. all viral proteins, including the VF1 protein product of ORF4, an innate immune antagonist (McFadden et al., 2011) were enriched in the viral replication complex. most host factors identified using VPg were enriched by >2 fold using only the NS1/2 tagged virus, and not the NS4-tagged virus. one protein was enriched by NS1/2 and NS4 \u2013 the core stress granule protein G3BP1 (Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 2). Identification of host factors required for norovirus infection using a CRISPR- knockout screen. BV2-Cas9 expressing cells were infected with lentiviruses carrying the Brie gRNA library carrying 78,637 independent guide RNAs to 19,674 genes. the transduced cells were then infected with two MNV strains, CW3 and CR6, which cause acute and persistent infections in immunocompetent mice respectively. STARS analysis was used to ranks genes with positive and negative values with an FDR value less than 0.05. the second most highly enriched gene was G3BP1, a gene also identified in one of the previous CRISPR screens performed on norovirus infected cells. BV2 cells were transduced with a CRISPR library then infected with either CR6 or CW3 for 24 hr. mRNA processing, RNA splicing and methylation were the most highly represented gene ontology terms. PTBP1 is a protein we have previously shown to bind to a 3\u2019 pyrimidine-rich stretch in the MNV genome which is important for viral pathogenesis. a cross-comparison of the data obtained from all three approaches allowed us to identify several host proteins that were common to all screens. a defect was observed in the ability to replicate to produce infectious virus in three independently selected G3BP1 cell lines. this effect was mirrored by an inability to induce cytopathic effect leading to virus-induced cell death. the ability of encephalomyocarditis virus to infect and cause cell death was unaffected by the deletion of G3BP1. BP1 clone C BV2 cells were plated in a 96 well plate and stained with crystal violet 5 days post infection. light micrographs of WT or G3BP1 cells mock infected (-) or infected with EMCV or MNV and visualised 5 days post infection. we examined the impact of loss of G3BP1 on human norovirus replication in cell culture. a significant increase in NV viral RNA levels was seen in WT cells. those lacking G3BP1 were completely unable to support NV RNA synthesis. we further validated these observations by transfection of the NV replicon. the error bars represent the standard error of three biological repeats. wild type BV2 cells, G3BP1 BV2 cells or G3BP1 BV2 cells reconstituted with wild type full length G3BP1 were transfected with NV replicon VPg-linked RNA. the cells were fixed and stained with toluidine blue to facilitate the visualisation of microcolonies. truncations used to identify domains involved in norovirus life cycle. positions of various domains including the RRM and RGG domains deleted in the RGG and RGG mutants are also shown. NV viral RNA was comparable to that obtained in WT cells in the presence of the nucleoside analogue 2'-C-methylcytidin (2CMC), a known inhibitor of the norovirus RNA polymerase. a minor increase in viral infectivity was observed in the G3BP1 cell line reconstituted with the RGG construct producing viral titres that were higher than those obtained from the WT complemented line in the presence of 2CMC. infectious virus yield from G3BP1 and reconstituted cell lines performed as described in panel A and B respectively. samples were prepared at 24 hr post transfection, prior to harvesting, separation by SDS-PAGE on a 4\u201312% gradient gel prior to western blotting. strand-specific RT-qPCR was used to quantify levels of viral positive and negative sense RNA in WT and G3BP1 cell lines following virus inoculation. samples were harvested at the indicated time post infection and viral positive (B) and negative sense RNA quantified by stand specific RT-qPCR (C) Error bars represent standard error of three biological repeats. similar results were obtained following transfection of viral RNA into cells to bypass the entry phase. norovirus VPg interacts with eIF4G to recruit ribosomal subunits. interaction occurs via a direct interaction between the highly conserved C-terminal region in VPg and the central HEAT domain of eIF4G. a stable complex can be formed between the eIF4G domain at least in vitro. disruption of the VPg-eIF4G interaction by the introduction of the F123A mutation into the eIF4G binding domain significantly reduced the ability to pull down RpS6, RpS3, as well as RpL4. we also observed that upon reconstitution of G3BP1 expression, the levels of RpS6, RpS3 and RpL4 associated with VPg were enhanced. in the absence of G3BP1, the amount of viral RNA associated with the ribosomal subunit protein RpS3 was decreased. these data suggest that that G3BP1 likely contributes in some manner to the association of VPg and viral VPg-linked RNA with ribosomal subunits. loss of G3BP1 results in decreased association between norovirus RNA and ribosomal proteins. WT or cells lacking G3BP1 were infected with MNV in presence of RNA polymerase inhibitor 2CMC. cells were infected with MNV in the presence of 2CMC and polysomes profiling on extracts prepared from cells at 4 and 9 hr post infection performed. quantitative of the viral RNA levels in cells in the presence of 2CMC confirmed that the absence of G3BP1 has no impact on the overall levels present at the time points examined. we noted that even in the presence of 2CMC, which inhibits viral RNA synthesis, there was a small but measurable increase in free 80S polysome profiles of ribosome containing fractions from mock or MNV infected wild type (WT) or G3BP1 (1B2) BV2 cells at 4 and 9 hr post infection. ribosome containing fractions expressed relative to WT infected BV2 cells. both cap-dependent (Figure 11B) and CrPV IRES-dependent translation (Figure 11C) were comparable in extracts prepared from WT and G3BP1 cell lines. the presence of VPg on the viral RNA 5\u2019 end confirmed by resistance to XrnI mediated degradation in vitro. the location of the 5\u2019 cap and the 3\u2019 poly (A) tails are highlighted in relation to the renilla and firefly luciferase coding regions, along with with the CrPV IRES. extracts were programmed with in vitro transcribed RNA as described in the text and levels of luciferase compared to those obtained using rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) sensitivity of purified VPg-linked RNA to various nucleases was compared to in vitro transcribed capped MNV gRNA (cap-gRNA) and the MNV1 full length cDNA construct. in vitro translation of viral VPg-linked RNA in rabbit reticulocyte lysates demonstrated robust translation. virus VPg-dependent protein synthesis uncovers a new function for G3BP1 in facilitating RNA virus genome translation. the detailed proteomic analysis of the viral replication and translation complexes formed during MNV infection resulted in the identification of host factors with previously identified roles in the MNV life cycle. s are dynamic cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein complexes that form rapidly under stress conditions. some viruses interact with stress granules to promote viral replication. some do so to counteract the inhibitory effect of stress granules on translation of viral RNA. the mechanism by which G3BP1 contributes to this process has yet to be fully explored but our data supports the hypothesis that G3BP1 directly or indirectly promotes the recruitment of ribosomal subunits to VPg-driven translation complexes. the RGG motif of G3BP1 is known to be essential for the association between G3BP1 and 40S subunits as well as the ability to from stress granules. the presence of G3BP1 in the NV VPg-containing complexes again fits with our hypothesis that G3BP1 plays a role in promoting viral VPg-dependent protein synthesis. recent studies have confirmed that G3BP1 is enriched at sites of viral RNA synthesis. mRNAs induced in response to norovirus infection are inefficiently translated. this modification of host cell translation is at least partially driven by the ability of the viral NS6 protease to cleave PABP and the induction of apoptosis. cleaved forms of eIF4G do support norovirus VPg-dependent translation. the viral proteins present in the viral translation complex are distinct from those present in complexes active for viral RNA synthesis. NS1/2 is the first protein to be translated from ORF1, therefore unprocessed NS1/2 at the N-terminus of the ORF1 polyprotein being actively translated could function as an anchor, facilitating the enrichment of ribosomes and associated factors. norovirus replication complexes are generated from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and results in the formation of single membrane vesicles, double membrane vesicles and multi membrane vesicles (MMVs) the process by which the non-structural proteins induce the formation of these structures is unknown, but the NS1/2 and NS4 proteins are thought to be key to the process. protein that has a critical role in the life cycle of murine and human noroviruses. this work suggests targeting G3BP1 may hold future therapeutic potential. IG is a Wellcome Senior Fellow. express T7 RNA polymerase (BSR-T7 cells) were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FCS, penicillin (100 SI units/ml) and streptomycin (100 g/ml), and 0.5 mg/ml G418. all cell lines were screened for mycoplasma and confirmed as negative. the identity of the cell lines was not confirmed by STR profiling. BV2 cells were then transduced with the pool of 3 lentiviruses. individual clones were then screened for the absence of G3BP1. cDNAs were subcloned into pCDH-MCS-T2A-puro-MSCV lentiviral vector. duction BV2 cells were selected with puromycin (2.5 ug/ml) for six days. infected cells were flash frozen at 80\u00b0C at times post infection indicated in the text. infected monolayers were either visualised by light microscopy directly or fixed with crystal violet in formalin. genes for which guide RNA are underrepresented suggest that infection had proceeded faster and the gene is anti-viral. SILAC cells were maintained in SILAC medium for 2 weeks to ensure complete metabolic labelling of proteins. pT7 MNV 383FLAG 3\u2019Rz or pT7 MNV 2600FLAG 3\u2019Rz were harvested by freeze-thaw at 24 hr post-transfection. to generate higher titre stocks, WT MNV, NS1/2-FLAG MNV, and NS4-FLAG MNV were harvested using the DNA based recovery method described above. cells were harvested by scraping and pelleted at 500xg for 5 min. cells were then washed three times with ice-cold PBS. lysates were then diluted with 1 vol of wash buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl) peptides eluted from the beads for each experimental replicate were pooled together in a ratio of 1:1:1. peptides were fractionated using a LTQ-Orbitrap Velos or Orbitrap Tribrid Fusion mass spectrometer. raw data, search results and FASTA files can be found as part of PRIDE submission PXD007585 (Reviewer username: reviewer75984@ebi.ac.uk, Password: eLYwivNP). raw data, search results and FASTA files can be found as part of PRIDE submission PXD011779. cells were seeded onto 96 well plates and infected with serial 10-fold dilutions of CW1 or EMCV. at 48 hr post-infection, cells were fixed in ice-cold methanol and stained with toluidine blue prior to washing and imaging. at least 1000 g of the cell lysates were incubated with sepharose beads coupled to 7-methylguanosine. pretreated RNAs were purified with and without proteinase K (10 g/ml) in 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1.0 mM EDTA, 0.1 M NaCl, and 0.5% SDS. all plates were harvested at day 14 and well-formed colonies were fixed in 10% formaldehyde and stained with toluidine blue. pre-incubated with antibody against either RpS3 or IgG for 12 hr at 4\u00b0C. protein A/G Ultralink resin slurry was added into cell lysates and antibody mixture and incubated further for 12 hr at 4\u00b0C. lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 20 min at 13,000 g at 4\u00b0C. input lysates were normalised to total protein concentration. RT-qPCR was used to confirm levels of viral RNA were comparable. total cellular RNA was extracted using GeneElute Mammalian Total RNA Miniprep kit (Sigma) RT-qPCR was performed as described previously. BV2 cells were harvested, washed with PBS, and analysed on 1% agarose gel. cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C twice. total protein concentration was measured by Bradford assay and normalised to 20 mg/ml before freezing at 80 \u00b0C until use. reactions were set up according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions using 0.5\u20131 ng/l RNA. reactions were incubated at 30 \u00b0C for 90 min before addition of 12.5 l trans-stop buffer containing 10 mM EDTA and 0.1 mg/ml RNase A. then 25 l 5X loading buffer was added to the reaction and heated at 95 \u00b0C for 5 min. clone 1B2 was generated by transiently transfected with Cas9 and a sgRNA (5TTCCCCGGCTGATGNGG) targeting exon 7 of G3BP1. BV2 cells are polyploid at the G3BP1 locus as described previously. individual clones were then screened by western blot for absence of G3BP1. cDNAs were subcloned into pCDH-MCS-T2A-puro-MSCV lentiviral vector. mouse G3BP1 was subcloned from pCM6-G3BP1. BV2 cells stably expressing Cas9 nuclease were transduced with the Brie library using previously described protocols. the screen relies on the premise that guide RNAs targeting genes that are overrepresented following infection represent genes that are protected against infection and therefore likely represent factors with pro-viral activity. in cell culture of BV2 cells was carried out in high-glucose DMEM lacking arginine and lysine (Sigma-Aldrich), supplemented with dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 1% L-glutamine, 1X nonessential amino acids, 10 mM HEPES, and 1X penicillin/streptomycin. labelling of HEK-293T cells was performed as described for BV2 cells. 80\u201390% of cells displayed visible cytopathic effects (CPE) of viral infection. flasks were frozen and thawed twice before cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 10 min in a benchtop centrifuge. concentrated virus was then passed through a 23-gauge blunt needle 15 times, and clarified by centrifugation at maximum speed. benzonase nuclease (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to lysis buffer to a concentration of 5 l/ml to prevent nonspecific interactions mediated by RNA or DNA. hek-293T cells were transfected with pEGFP-C1 or derivatives thereof containing either wild-type protein or mutant VPg protein. GFP-trap immunoprecipitation of VPg was accomplished using GFP-trap beads (Chromotek) per manufacturer\u2019s protocol. RNase cocktail (Ambion) was also included in lysis buffer at a concentration of 5 l/ml to prevent non-specific interactions mediated by RNA. the experiments were searched against the Uniprot mouse database (Swiss-prot only, 16,966 entries, downloaded May 19th 2018) the raw data, search results and FASTA files can be found as part of PRIDE submission PXD011779 (Reviewer username: reviewer49419@ebi.ac.uk, Password: eLYwivNP) cap-Sepharose purification for eIF4F complex Cell lysates were prepared from BHK parental cells or BHK containing GI Norwalk virus replicon cells. at least 1000 g of the cell lysates were incubated with Sepharose beads coupled to 7-methylguanosine (m7GTP), Jena Biosciences. RNA co-immunoprecipitation was performed using BV2 WT and BV2G3BP1 clone IB2 cells inoculated with MNV1 at MOI of 50 TCID50 per cell. cells were pre-incubated with antibody against either RpS3 or IgG for 12 hr. polyribosome fractionation analysis BV2 WT and BV2 G3BP1 cells were seeded at a density of 7.5 106 cells per T-75 flask. then either mock infected or infected with MNV1 (CW1) at MOI 3 TCID50 per cell in the presence of 2-CMC (400 M) for each set of infection. after 1 hr, the inoculum was then removed; the cells were washed and maintained in RNAs were extracted from each fraction, converted to cDNA and immediately used for qPCR. the distribution of viral RNA across the gradient was then calculated as percentage (%) of the viral RNA seen in WT BV2 cells using the reference gene (GAPDH) cell debris was removed by low speed centrifugation for 10 min. supernatant loaded onto 5 ml of 30% sucrose solution in PBS. RNA extracted from soluble fraction was examined by nuclease digestion. S10 extracts were thawed on ice, 1 mM calcium chloride and 200 unit/ml final concentrations of micrococcal nuclease (NEB) cell lysates were incubated at 25 \u00b0C for 15 min before adding 3 mM final concentration of EGTA was added. 10 l lysates were resolved in 15% SDS-PAGE. the reactions were stopped with 100 l 1x passive lysis buffer (Promega) and the luminescence read using a GloMax luminometer (Promega) validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing\u2014review and editing.
