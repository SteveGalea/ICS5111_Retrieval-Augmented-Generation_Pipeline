{"summary": "PEDV is an economically important pathogen of swine. it mainly causes porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), a disease that is characterized by acute enteritis, diarrhea, vomiting and dehydration. the highest mortality often occurs to the newborns of one week old. the novel variants of PEDV are the major cause of the PED global pandemic. the epidemic viruses are characterized by deletions, insertions or amino acid substitutions in the S gene and other regions as compared to the classical strains such as CV777 [4, 22, 30]. in 2013, Li et al reported the first genetic manipulation of PEDV genome by using targeted genetic recombination in mammalian cells. the cDNA clone of a low virulent Chinese isolate of PEDV was constructed. the virus genome is subject to the control of the CMV promoter. the recombinant BAC plasmids behaved like their respective parental virus. genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis Virion RNAs were extracted from PEDV-infected cell supernatant by using the QIAamp viral RNA kit (Qiagen) the PCR products were gel purified and cloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega) with 3\u20134 clones chosen for sequencing. the sequences of 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 ends of PEDV genome were determined by SMARTTM RACE cDNA amplification plasmid pBAC-I is an intermediate that has been modified based on plasmid pBleoBACII (NEB) to facilitate assembly of PEDV full-length cDNA clone. each intermediate assembly was verified by DNA sequencing before proceeding to the next step, and the final plasmid was named pBAC-CHM2013. recombinant BAC plasmids were prepared by using the Omega Maxi plasmid prep kit (Omega) the DNA was evaluated for quality on 0.8% agarose gel and quantified by spectrophotometry at the optical density at 260 nm (OD260) for transfection, vero CCL81 cells were seeded into six-well plates in 2 ml of the complete medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and then incubated at 37\u00b0C nuclear DNA stained with DAPI [Molecular Probes] for 5 min. multi-step growth curve Vero cells in 12-well plates were infected with wild-type PEDV or the infectious clone-derived viruses at different dilutions. after absorption for 1h at 37\u00b0C, the unbound viruses were removed. the animals were monitored every 4 h for clinical signs of disease and weight gain. for the mock and CHM2013 groups, the piglets had been healthy all the time. we used euthanasia as humane endpoints at 7 days post infection (dpi) two-way RM ANOVA test in the GraphPad Prism 5 (CA, USA) significance values were represented as follows: *or #: P0.05 (statistically significant); ** or ##: P0.01; ** or ###: P0.001 (extremely significant). ethics statement The animal experiments were performed according to the Chinese Regulation of Laboratory Animals. 27 sets of primers were designed to cover the full-length genome of PEDV. the PCR products were gel purified and cloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega) with 3\u20134 clones chosen for sequencing. the sequences of 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 ends of PEDV genome were determined by SMARTTM RACE cDNA amplification kit. each fragment was PCR amplified, gel purified, and then cloned to pEASY-Blunt fast ligation vector. the correct clones were then verified by DNA sequencing. the fragments were then cloned into the BAC plasmid pBAC-I. 1.2 g of the recombinant BAC plasmids were transfected into vero cells. at 24 h post transfection, the cells were washed once and then replenished. trypsin was added at a final concentration of 10 g/ml. piglets were randomly divided into 3 groups with 4 pigs for each group. pigs were inoculated with 2 ml of rBJ2011C or rCHM2013 at a dose of 1X105 TCID50/ml. the control group was mock-infected with 2 ml DMEM. the animals were monitored every 4 h for clinical signs of disease and weight gain. for the mock and CHM2013 groups, the piglets had been healthy all the time. we used euthanasia as humane endpoints at 7 days post infection (dpi) phylogenetic analysis of PEDV isolates BJ2011C and CHM2013. initial outbreak of highly pathogenic PED took place around 2010 in south china. in 2011, we isolated a strain named BJ2011C from a pig farm in china. then another strain named CHM2013 in 2013 from a PEDV vaccinated swine farm. PEDV strains CV777, AVCT12 and SM98 share identity ranging from 95.1% to 99.8 at nucleotide level. Interestingly, BJ2011C is not grouped into the same clade as the U.S. strains or the Chinese strain AH2012. ucleotide deletion at the end of S gene and a 30-nucleotide deletion at the start of ORF3 including the start codon ATG of ORF3. this deletion is consistent with that of SM98, AVCT12 and EASI strains. BAC11 was modified to create a shuttle plasmid pBAC-I. each fragment was assembled into pBAC-I in an order of A-F-C-D-E-B. a synonymous mutation (T1809C) was introduced in segment A to serve as the genetic marker. the corresponding viruses were named rCHM2013 and rBJ2011C. the identity of the viruses was confirmed by the immunofluorescence assay. we have successfully rescued the recombinant viruses by using the DNA-launched system. rBJ2011c and rCHM2013 rescued piglets were randomly divided into three groups and orally inoculated with rCHM2013 or rCHM2013. rBJ2011c and rCHM2013 recapitulated the features in aspects of virulence and clinical symptoms of their respective parental viruses aforementioned. piglets from the rBJ2011C group started the virus shedding within 24 h post challenge. all four shed the virus within 36\u201348 h post challenge. no detectable virus shedding could be found for mock or rCHM2013 group. rBJ2011c infected all segments of intestine, including duodenum, ileum, jejunum, cecum, colon and rectum. the most severe damages occurred in jejunum. rCHM2013 was restricted to jejunum and Ileum. different segments, including duodenum, jejunum, cecum, colon and rectum, of intestines from each group were taken and then processed for HE staining. pound (#) indicates a significant difference between rBJ2011C and mock (###P0.001). Isolation and phylogenetic analysis of PEDV isolates BJ2011C and CHM2013. CHM2013 was 27994 nt in length, excluding the poly (A) tail. the whole genome-based phylogenetic tree was drawn accordingly. the PEDV strains are divided into two groups: G1 and G2. pandemic viruses contain had a total of 5 amino acid deletion and 2 amino acid insertion. this feature was also observed in the S protein of PEDV BJ2011C strain. the phylogenetic tree is slightly different from that based on whole genome alignment. the sequence in fragment A was fused to the CMV promoter. the viral 3\u2019 end in fragment F was fused to the sequence containing polyA (28 A), HdvRz and BGH polyadenylation signals. a synonymous mutation (G15932A) was found in fragment D and retained as a genetic marker to distinguish from the parental virus. plasmids pBAC-BJ2011C and pBAC-CHM2013 were transfected. the virus-induced CPE appeared in the well transfected with pBAC-CHM2013. after 48\u201396 h, the CPE appeared in the well transfected with pBAC-CHM2013. rBJ2011C and rCHM2013 exhibited growth kinetics similar to parental viruses. however, at each time point, the titer of the recombinant virus was slightly lower than that of the parental virus. rBJ2011C generally made smaller plaques than rCHM2013. one piglet started severe diarrhea at 24 h post challenge. the other three developed severe diarrhea around 30 h after challenge. all four piglets exhibited substantial weight loss, had highest clinical score. all four shed the virus within 36\u201348 h post challenge. no detectable virus shedding could be found for mock or rCHM2013 group. rBJ2011C caused extensive damages to all intestinal segments. quantitative RT-PCR results showed that rBJ2011c infected all segments of intestine. the ileum apparently had the highest viral load; however, the virus abundance in the jejunum was several logs lower. on the other hand, no viral RNA could be detected in the CHM2013 group. the emergence of HP-PEDV was sudden and occurred around 2010 in China [22, 23], followed by the devastating PED outbreak on the North American continent three years later. the earlier Asian isolates such as the Chinese AH2012 and Korean KNU-1305 share high nucleotide identity with the North American prototype strains. this suggests a common evolutionary origin and a possible transmission route from Asia to North America [25, 26, 29, 44] recombination efficiency is very low, and this approach can also select for viral mutants. another approach is the assembly of the full-length PEDV genome by in vitro ligation [33, 35] the virus genome is cloned into BAC and set under control of the CMV promoter. the viral mRNA will be synthesized by host RNA polymerase II. the most challenging problem is the stability issue in E.coli of the BAC plasmid. the reverse genetics system is at hand for both high and low virulent strains. this should aid the construction of chimeric viruses for dissecting viral virulence determinants."}
