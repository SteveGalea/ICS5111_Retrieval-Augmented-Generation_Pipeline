{"summary": "the phenomenon of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) as a hormone precursor emerged gradually over time as observations slowly filled in pieces of the puzzle. the bronzed skin color described by Addison in his patient with adrenal insufficiency gave perhaps the first hints of a connection between the hypothalamic, pituitary, adrenal (HPA) axis and skin color. these observations and interventions could be considered overtly simplistic. don Steiner's work paved the way for a much greater understanding of a whole range of pro-insulin precursors. adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and -lipotropin (-LPH) had been characterized separately. concept that they were produced as part of a common precursor had not been considered and only emerged after a number of different approaches suggested the sequences for these different peptides in the same molecule (FIGURE 1). pro-hormone convertase 1/3 (PC1/3) sequentially cleaves POMC pro-ACTH adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in hypothalamus, skin, and pars intermedia of the pituitary, ACTH is further cleaved by PC2 to produce ACTH (1\u201317) and corticotropin-like intermediate peptide (CLIP) cloning cDNA from pituitary pars intermedia provided the gene sequence for bovine POMC (265) the same year, cloning cDNA from pituitary pars intermedia provided the gene sequence for the human (72, 391), mouse (407), rat (105), and pig (38) genes (69) the absence of pairs of dibasic amino acids at the relevant sites in the rat/mouse POMC sequence predicts that -melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH) and -MSH will not be produced. in both humans and murine models lacking POMC, no obvious. phenotypes relating to these diverse tissues have been reported. the use of the POMC-Cre mouse line expressing a fluorescent protein has further confused our understanding of the expression patterns of POMC. however, the Pomc-Cre manipulation will allow fluorescent protein to continue to be expressed in adulthood. pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) as a hormone precursor emerged gradually. the bronzed skin color described by Addison in his patient with adrenal insufficiency gave perhaps the first hints of a connection between the hypothalamic, pituitary, adrenal (HPA) axis and skin color. a similar link between the pituitary and pigmentation came from the studies of Allen (5) and Smith (376) the emergingence of the precursor paradigm is likely that POMC arose over 500 million years ago by an insertion of the melanocortin sequences into a prepro-endorphin gene. evidence for this comes from structural identities with other opioid precursors in both the NH2- and COOH-terminal regions of POMC (266). adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and -lipotropin (-LPH) had been characterized separately. the concept that they were produced as part of a common precursor had not been considered and only emerged after a number of different approaches suggested the sequences for these different peptides in the same molecule (FIGURE 1). pro-hormone convertase 1/3 (PC1/3) sequentially cleaves POMC pro-ACTH adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in hypothalamus, skin, and pars intermedia of the pituitary, ACTH is further cleaved by PC2 to produce ACTH (1\u201317) and corticotropin-like intermediate peptide (CLIP) the precursor peptide was purified from rat pituitaries (335) and (rather strangely) from camel pituitaries (200) the same year, cloning cDNA from pituitary pars intermedia provided the gene sequence for bovine POMC (265) the absence of dibasic amino acids at relevant sites in the rat/mouse POMC sequence predicts that -melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH) and -MSH will not be produced. high-molecular-weight forms of ACTH and -LPH were also identified in the mouse pituitary tumor cell line AtT20 (119, 232) terminal of -LPH was a serendipitous finding by Hughes et al. (173). they identified the Met-enkephalin sequence at the NH2 terminal of -endorphin. this was confirmed by the sequencing of -endorphin. the concept that POMC was a pro-hormone for ACTH and -LPH was confirmed in studies with the ACTH-secreting AtT20 cell line. in 1978, mains and Eipper radiolabeled amino acids in the cells and then used immunoprecipitation and SDS gel electrophoresis, enabling them to identify a 31-kDa peptide recognized by antibodies to both ACTH and -LPH. species differences in the cleavage sites of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) cleave at dibasic sites comprising lysine (K) and arginine (R) these sites are generally well conserved, but occur at different amino acid numbers in the human, mouse/rat, and dog sequence. many of these tissues contain a shorter mRNA transcript that would not be translated. in both humans and murine models lacking POMC, no obvious phenotypes have been reported. the use of the POMC-Cre mouse line expressing a fluorescent protein has further confused our understanding of expression patterns. POMC is cleaved by pro-hormone convertases (PCs) at well-defined dibasic amino acid sequences. cleavage is carried out by pro-hormone convertase 1/3 (PC1/3) which cleaves at sites where there are dibasic amino acids. the next stage in cleavage occurs between the COOH terminal of joining peptide and the NH2 terminal of ACTH. the human joining peptide is amidated and secreted as a homodimer joined by a cysteine bridge (25). it is thought that there is relatively little further processing in the anterior pituitary. this would result in N-POMC, joining peptide, ACTH, and -LPH as the major POMC-derived peptides released from the anterior pituitary. -MSH is more potent in modulating pigmentation, memory, and attraction. des-acetyl -MSH is more effective in blocking opiate analgesia. -LPH can then be processed at a Lys-Lys site to release -MSH from its COOH terminal. a pair of dibasic amino acids at 49/50 would enable enzymatic cleavage to N-POMC (1\u201349) and 3-MSH (also known as Lys-3-MSH) the cleavage takes place at the COOH-terminal side of the arginine residue leaving lysine as the first amino acid in 3-MSH (29). the 3-MSH peptide has flanking dibasic amino acids. in the human POMC sequence, the 1-MSH peptide has flanking dibasic amino acids and therefore the potential for cleavage. generation of -MSH and -Endorphin From -LPH is processed initially by cleavage of the amino acids between the COOH terminal of -lipotropin (-LPH) and the NH2 terminal of -endorphin (FIGURE 1). -LPH can then be processed at a Lys-Lys site to release -MSH from its COOH terminal to release -MSH from its COOH terminal. 3-MSH was not expected to include the first lysine, but the cleavage takes place at the COOH-terminal side of the arginine residue leaving lysine as the first amino acid in 3-MSH (29). the cleavage takes place at the COOH-terminal side of the arginine residue leaving lysine as the first amino acid. the 1-MSH peptide has flanking dibasic amino acids. the cleavage occurs at the COOH terminal of the pair of dibasic amino acids. the cleavage occurs at the NH2 terminal of ACTH. ACTH is not cleaved in human anterior pituitary corticotropes. cleavage occurs only in melanotropes and not in corticotropes. it took 15 yr to discover enzymes that cleave peptides from POMC. PC1/3 has a signal peptide and an 80\u201390 amino acid prosegment at the NH2 terminal. the prosegment is thought to act as an intramolecular chaperone and a competitive inhibitor of the active site of the enzyme. in the endoplasmic reticulum, the inhibitory prosegment is removed by an autocatalytic process. PC2 has a specific binding protein, 7B2, which is required for transport, folding, and activation of PC2 (22). the NH2 terminal of 7B2 has a chaperone function, while the COOH terminal of 7B2 inhibits PC2 (136). 7B2 is thought to bind to the catalytic domain of PC2 and is required for the efficient transport and activation of the enzyme. ll mice have higher ACTH in the pituitary than 7B2 null mice. but the 7B2 null mice secrete more ACTH providing further evidence for the role of 7B2 in the regulated secretory process. proSAAS is expressed primarily in the brain and in other neuroendocrine tissues. -helical domain at the COOH terminus may associate with the cytoplasmic side of the secretory granule membrane. cleavage at Arg617-Arg618, adjacent to the membrane, would produce the mature PC1/3 (10) it has been suggested that the insertion in the membrane occurs in the rough ER cisternae and that PC1/3 is transported to the TGN in this form and packaged into secretory vesicles. there are very few studies that have focused on the molar ratios of each of the peptides. lack of readily available assays for N-POMC and joining peptide makes it difficult to measure these peptides in human plasma. absence of PC2 from the anterior pituitary means further processing of the peptides does not occur. PCE cleaves POMC to give 21\u201323 kDa ACTH, 4.5 kDa ACTH, and 13 kDa ACTH (glycosylated), -LPH, and -MSH (222). the gene for PCE has not been cloned, and therefore, no in situ analysis has been undertaken. PAM PAM amidates the COOH terminal of ACTH (1\u201313) in the pathway creating -MSH. this process occurs when the POMC-derived peptides are in the secretory granules. it is difficult to find any evidence for a role for ACTH (1\u201313) without the subsequent modifications, so this suggests PAM is critical in the generation of -MSH. -hydroxyglycine -amidating lyase (PAL) domain is attached to a transmembrane domain and a cytosolic domain so both catalytic units are held at the membrane but project into the lumen of the large dense-core secretory vesicles (68). there is also a naturally occurring soluble form called PHM4, made up of only the PAL domain and generated by alternative splicing (68). the deacetylated form of -MSH was identified in the pituitaries of a number of species as early as 1974. studies in the 1980s suggested that most of the -MSH is in the acetylated form in the pars intermedia the pituitary (97). a difference in biological function between des-acetyl -MSH and -MSH has been recognized for some time in terms of behavioral effects. but there are also several in vivo studies showing differences in the potencies of the N-acetylated and des-acetyl forms of -MSH, in terms of food intake. the acetylation process occurs after the des-acetyl -MSH has traveled along the neuron and just before secretion of the vesicles (258) in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (FIGURE 3). the relative concentrations of -MSH and des-acetyl -MSH in the arcuate nucleus would be less relevant. l -MSH and acetylated -endorphin (-EP) are the prominent peptides generated. the presence of N-acetyltransferase in the processing cascade would increase -MSH. this could be a mechanism to provide distinct melanotropic action. prolyl endopeptidase (PREP, also known as prolyl oligopeptidase) can cleave the terminal amidated valine of -MSH to also give -MSH (1\u201312) (304) the function of -MSH (1\u201312) is unclear as it does not activate MC4R. active pro-hormone convertases are cleaved from inactive precursors. active pro-hormone convertases are cleaved from inactive precursors. cleavage occurs only in melanotropes and not in corticotropes. inhibitory prosegment is removed by an autocatalytic process. the precursor protein appears to act as a competitive inhibitor at the active site of the enzyme. the pro-PC1/3 pro-hormone convertase is able to act as an inhibitor of PC1/3 (215) PC2 has a specific binding protein, 7B2, which is required for transport, folding, and activation of PC2 (22). the NH2 terminal of 7B2 has a chaperone function, while the COOH terminal of 7B2 inhibits PC2 (136). 7B2 is thought to bind to the catalytic domain of PC2 and is required for the efficient transport and activation of the enzyme. proSAAS is expressed primarily in the brain and in other neuroendocrine tissues. it reduces POMC processing by inhibiting PC1/3. but PC2 is not affected (138). vage at Arg617-Arg618, adjacent to the membrane, would produce the mature PC1/3 (10) it has been suggested that the insertion in the membrane occurs in the rough ER cisternae and that PC1/3 is transported to the TGN in this form and then packaged into secretory vesicles. an alternative suggestion for PC1/3 is that the pro-region associates with lipid rafts. the absence of PC2 from the anterior pituitary means that further processing of the peptides does not occur. the presence of PC2 in the hypothalamus and skin causes the further cleavage of ACTH, -LPH, and N-POMC. the gene for PCE has not been cloned. it took 15 yr to discover the enzymes that cleave the peptides from POMC. the kex2-like subtilisins have similar catalytic mechanisms to trypsin-like proteases. in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the inhibitory prosegment is removed by an autocatalytic process. the precursor protein seems to act as a competitive inhibitor at the active site of the processed PC. a similar mechanism occurs for PC1/3 (153). PC2 has a specific binding protein, 7B2, which is required for transport, folding, and activation of PC2 (22). the NH2 terminal of 7B2 has a chaperone function, while the COOH terminal of 7B2 inhibits PC2 (136). 7B2 is thought to bind to the catalytic domain of PC2 and is required for the efficient transport and activation of the enzyme. proSAAS is expressed primarily in the brain and in other neuroendocrine tissues. it reduces POMC processing by inhibiting PC1/3. but PC2 is not affected (138). cleavage at Arg617-Arg618, adjacent to the membrane, would produce the mature PC1/3 (10) it has been suggested that the insertion in the membrane occurs in the rough ER cisternae and that PC1/3 is transported to the TGN in this form and then packaged into secretory vesicles. an alternative suggestion for PC1/3 is that the pro-region associates with lipid rafts. the absence of PC2 from the anterior pituitary means that further processing of the peptides does not occur. the presence of PC2 in the hypothalamus and skin causes the further cleavage of ACTH, -LPH, and N-POMC. the melanocortin peptides are released under the control of regulatory mechanisms. the gene for PCE has not been cloned, and therefore, no in situ analysis has been undertaken. the further processing of POMC after the action of PC1/3 and PC2 involves multiple stages and many different enzymes. in 1997, peng Loh\u2019s group showed that CPE also acts as a pro-hormone sorting receptor for the regulated secretory pathway. this function is necessary for pro-hormones to move from the TGN into secretory granules. importance of this role is indicated by the results from the Cpe gene deletion which highlights the missorting of pro-hormones. secretory granule endoproteases cleave the two domains from the membrane. however, there is also a naturally occurring soluble form called PHM4. there is also evidence that PAM alters the organization of the actin cytoskeleton which is important in the release of secretory vesicles from cells (121). studies in the 1980s suggested that most of the -MSH is in the acetylated form in the pars intermedia the pituitary (97). in the human and rat hypothalamus, deacetylated -MSH was found to be a major component when assessed with HPLC techniques (273). the regional heterogeneity in the forms of -MSH was investigated. -MSH has been recognized for some time in terms of behavioral effects (273) but there are also several in vivo studies showing differences in the potencies of the N-acetylated and des-acetyl forms of -MSH, in terms of food intake (reviewed in Refs. 258, 429). little of the active N-acetylated -MSH relative to des-acetylated -MSH in the arcuate nucleus. the acetylation process occurs after the des-acetyl -MSH has traveled along the neuron and just before secretion of the vesicles (258) in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. peptidase (PRCP) to give -MSH (1\u201312), which is inactive. nonacetylated -endorphin is found in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. but acetylated -endorphin was thought to be the main form in the NTS. the function of -MSH (1\u201312) is unclear as it does not activate MC4R. the pro-hormone convertases process peptides usually at the carboxyl residue after the single or paired basic amino acid motif. after cleavage, the Lys and/or Arg residues are removed by CPE. ACTH (1\u201313) can amidate the COOH terminal of joining peptide. this process occurs when the POMC-derived peptides are in the secretory granules. this process occurs when the POMC-derived peptides are in the secretory granules. n-acetyltransferase Acetylation of the NH2-terminal amino acid residues of -MSH and -endorphin is important for the activity of these peptides. the deacetylated form of -MSH was identified in the pituitaries of a number of species as early as 1974. the amygdala and periaqueductal gray contained non-acetylated -MSH. the nucleus accumbens had the mono- and di-acetyl forms of -MSH. acetylation occurred in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) ous -MSH and des-acetyl -MSH demonstrated that when these peptides were administered they could each equally decrease body weight (259) presumably by reducing food intake. acetylation could be a mechanism by which the biological activities of POMC peptides are modulated. pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) processing begins in the trans-Golgi network. peptides move to the neuronal terminals in the paraventricular nucleus. -MSH is released to activate melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) and decrease food intake. the presence of N-acetyltransferase in the processing cascade would increase -MSH, thus potentiating -MSH activity and acetylate -endorphin thus reducing its function. there is evidence to suggest that the acetylation of -MSH and -endorphin is tissue specific. cleus accumbens had the mono- and di-acetyl (second acetyl group on the third amino acid) forms of -MSH (97) acetylation occurred in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) because -MSH was found there (113). there is evidence that the two forms of -MSH may activate intracellular signaling pathways differently. NH2-terminal acetylation of -MSH confers stability on the peptide. acetylation could be a mechanism by which the biological activities of POMC peptides are modulated. there is also evidence that leptin induces an N-acetylase in mouse hypothalamus (156), so in addition to increasing the POMC gene expression, it was suggested that leptin could increase the biologically active -MSH. processing begins in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) which is based in the cell body in the paraventricular nucleus (ARC) there is some suggestion that N-acetyltransferase converts des-acetyl -MSH (des--MSH) to -MSH at the neuronal terminal such that -MSH is released to activate melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) and decrease food intake. acetylation of -MSH and -endorphin is tissue specific. presence of N-acetyltransferase in the processing cascade would increase -MSH, thus potentiating -MSH activity and acetylate -endorphin thus reducing its function. all pro-hormones are moved into the ER where the NH2-terminal recognition signal anchors them to the membrane. the ER then plays a role in removing the signal peptide at the NH2 terminal of POMC using a signalase enzyme. as POMC passes out of the ER it will have had N-linked oligosaccharides added. the initial cleavage of POMC at the COOH terminal of ACTH is likely to occur in the secretory vesicles. cleavage at the NH2 terminal of ACTH to generate mature ACTH (1\u201339) is likely to occur in the secretory vesicles. if all the processing occurs in the vesicle, then ACTH and -endorphin will be present in the same vesicles. this is important for understanding whether -MSH and -MSH peptides are released at the same time and at the same site. mogranin A (CGA), a member of the granin family, also includes chromogranin B (CGB, secretogranin I) and chromogranin C (CGC, secretogranin II) (199) compensatory increases in expression of other granin family members can compensate for CGA deficiency (163) pro-hormone Sorting is a prerequisite for processing of many pro-hormones. the sorting receptor was identified as CPE (81, 83) for POMC. this has a ligand binding domain for the POMC sorting motif. the binding site on CPE, which is distinct from the enzyme active site, also recognizes pro-insulin and pro-insulin (441) POMC is not processed but secreted in large amounts from the constitutive pathway in the pituitary of the Cpefat/fat mice (83, 357) another carboxypeptidase, CPD, is present in the TGN and cycles between the TGN and the cell surface. CPD may be responsible for removal of dibasic amino acids or sorting of pro-hormones in the absence of CPE (102). a large number of peptide and protein hormones aggregate into insoluble macromolecular complexes. these aggregates are crystalline or composed of amyloid fibrils that are cross-sheet structures. there is also evidence for amyloid aggregates in the mouse pituitary cell line AtT20. the dissociation of the monomeric hormone from the amyloid allowing its release from the cell is harder to determine. the release of ACTH from pituitary cells is also stimulated by arginine vasopressin and inhibited by glucocorticoids. constitutive pathway of secretion is a route allowing the release of peptides from cells which is not regulated by external factors. examples of peptides released in this way include lysosomal enzymes secreted by fibroblasts (166) and acetylcholinesterase released from muscle cells (332). POMC processing to convert POMC to ACTH began in the ISGs. incompletely processed POMC was also secreted in ISGs by a distinct pathway that has been termed the constitutive-like pathway. a second caveat is that all ACTH assays recognize ACTH precursors to some degree (255), so the \u201cACTH\u201d measured may in fact be ACTH precursors. POMC has a specific \u201cheart-shaped\u201d conformation at its NH2 terminal. it occurs by the formation of two disulfide bonds formed from Cys28/Cys50 and Cys34/Cys46 in the region upstream of -MSH. as POMC passes out of the ER it will have had N-linked oligosaccharides added. the initial cleavage of POMC at the COOH terminal of ACTH can occur in the Golgi apparatus. however, subsequent modifications continue in the secretory vesicles. if all the processing occurs in the vesicle, then ACTH and -MSH could be found in different vesicles. this is important for understanding whether -MSH and -endorphin peptides are released at the same time and at the same site. further processing of ACTH to -MSH requires PC2 but also the enzymes CPE, PAM, and N-AT. how activation is achieved is not fully understood (100) chromogranin A (Chga) gene indicates compensatory increases in expression of other granin family members can compensate for CGA deficiency (163) pro-hormone Sorting is a prerequisite for processing of many pro-hormones. it is reasonable to assume that this is the case for pro-neuropeptides involved in energy balance. the binding site on CPE, which is distinct from the enzyme active site, also recognizes pro-insulin and pro-enkephalin (441). secretogranin III can also have a synergistic role with CPE in the trafficking of POMC and derived peptides. another carboxypeptidase, CPD, is present in the TGN and cycles between the TGN and the cell surface. it appears to reside in immature secretory granules, but absent from the mature granules. CPD may be responsible for removal of dibasic amino acids or sorting of pro-hormones in the absence of CPE (102). peptide and protein hormones aggregate into insoluble macromolecular complexes. -endorphin does not appear to be processed from -LPH in human pituitary cells. there is a suggestion that pro-hormones aggregate less than the hormones derived from them. itary cell is stimulated to release ACTH, the vesicles have to dock with the cell membrane. synaptotagmin 1 and SNARE proteins are responsible for synaptic vesicle priming, docking, and fusion to the cell membrane. each of the core complex proteins is related to other similar proteins in their class. osomal enzymes secreted by fibroblasts (166) and acetylcholinesterase released from muscle cells (332) this pathway can be inhibited by monensin, which is an ionophore that can inhibit the transport of secretory proteins through the TGN. there is evidence that atT20 cells rapidly release newly synthesized pro-insulin from a constitutive pathway. incompletely processed POMC was secreted in ISGs by a distinct pathway that has been termed the constitutive-like pathway. a second caveat is that all ACTH assays recognize ACTH precursors to some degree (255), so the \u201cACTH\u201d measured may in fact be ACTH precursors. a second caveat is that all ACTH assays recognize ACTH precursors to some degree (255) MC1R is located primarily in melanocytes of skin and in hair follicles. the main role of melanocortin signaling through MC1R is in regulation of pigmentation in the skin. MC2R is also known as the ACTH receptor. it only binds ACTH and is unable to bind any of the MSH peptides. MC2R is expressed in the adrenal cortex and requires the accessory protein MRAP. MC4R is widely expressed throughout the central nervous system, but has a very high expression level in the PVN of the hypothalamus (260) other POMC-derived peptide agonists such as des-acetyl -MSH and -MSH are likely to have similar physiological relevence. -endorphin is the only POMC-derived peptide said to bind this type of receptor. it is not clear whether its immediate precursor, -lipotropin, might also bind the receptor. there is also complexity as to how well other endorphins bind the receptors and the implications for morphine as a substrate. -MSH > ACTH > -MSH MSH, melanocyte stimulating hormone; ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone. MC1R is located primarily in melanocytes of skin and in hair follicles. it is also expressed in macrophages and adipocytes. MC2R is expressed in the adrenal cortex and requires the accessory protein MRAP to enable it to translocate to the cell surface so it can function. MC3R acts primarily as an inhibitory \u201cauto-receptor\u201d on POMC neurons in the arcuate nucleus, the region associated with energy balance. the antagonist for MC4R, agouti-related peptide (AgRP), is also released in the PVN. the release of both the agonist and the antagonist allows for a complex regulatory mechanism for signaling via MC4R in the PVN. MC2R is also known as the ACTH receptor. it only binds ACTH and is unable to bind any of the MSH peptides. MC2R is expressed in the adrenal cortex and requires the accessory protein MRAP. MC4R is widely expressed throughout the central nervous system, but has a very high expression level in the PVN of the hypothalamus (260) other POMC-derived peptide agonists such as des-acetyl -MSH and -MSH are likely to have similar physiological relevence. -endorphin is the only POMC-derived peptide said to bind this type of receptor. it is not clear whether its immediate precursor, -lipotropin, might also bind the receptor. there is also complexity as to how well other endorphins bind the receptors and the implications for morphine as a substrate. pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) processing generates numerous functional peptides. the primary roles of the different functional peptides cleaved from POMC are shown. for researchers concentrating on the actions of -MSH in regulation of food intake, it may not occur to them to question how POMC is processed. the different POMC peptides require slightly different extraction procedures. the assays for the different POMC peptides require slightly different extraction procedures especially when extracting them from hypothalamic tissue. this procedure can also affect the subsequent immunoassay. ACTH travels in the circulation and acts on the adrenal gland to cause the release of cortisol in humans and corticosterone in rodents. this occurs in the zona fasciculata where ACTH binds to the MC2R. this occurs in the mitochondrion where ACTH stimulates transcription and translation of steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein. the basal ACTH secretion has an indirect role in modulating circadian biology. this role is performed by a peptide from the NH2-terminal region of POMC. however, ACTH replacement in POMC knockout mice is sufficient to cause normal adrenal development. it has been shown that POMC is synthesized by lymphocytes (34) and that ACTH is produced. this suggests that the processing of POMC follows a pattern similar to the anterior pituitary, requiring the coordinated expression of PC1/3 and the presence of a regulated secretory pathway. -MSH from the pars intermedia of the pituitary in rodents. -MSH from the hypothalamus is not produced by human pituitaries. it is also thought unlikely that -MSH from the hypothalamus gets into the circulation. however, there are reports of low levels of -MSH in human blood (172, 190) which may be skin-derived (see sect. IX) MC null mice reduced food intake to 35% of sham-treated animals. -MSH precursors, des-acetyl -MSH (at high doses) and ACTH, had similar effects. this is controversial as there is also evidence that des-acetyl -MSH injected into the brain had no effect on food intake. des-acetyl -MSH was the major product in the arcuate nucleus with lesser amounts of -MSH and ACTH. -MSH predominated in the NTS in the brain stem (113, 114). this seems at odds with reports that des-acetyl -MSH is relatively unstable compared with other POMC-derived peptides. -LPH functions primarily as a precursor for -MSH and -endorphin. in the human pituitary, -LPH is unlikely to be further processed. the cleavage sites require PC2 which is not present. -MSH binds MC4R with similar affinity to -MSH. -MSH is able to reduce food intake in corticosterone-supplemented Pomc null mice. evidence for a role for -MSH also comes from studies in humans. -LPH is cleaved to -endorphin (1\u201327) and -endorphin (1\u201326) these enzymes act in secretory granules within cells. this implies that the cleavage of -endorphin to the COOH-terminally truncated -endorphin peptides is a mechanism to reduce opioid activity in tissues where other POMC peptides are released for non-opioid functions. -endorphin is produced in POMC neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. it is difficult to rationalize how POMC is stimulated to specifically produce -endorphin to have its analgesic function in a physiological setting. however, there are very few reports linking how stimulation of POMC specifically drives analgesia without releasing the melanocortin peptides. mechanism was elucidated in studies in rats and involves release of hypothalamic -endorphin into hypophysial portal blood. -MSH blocks both stress-induced and -endorphin-stimulated release of prolactin in rats (267) in monkeys, -MSH has a similar effect on -endorphin-induced prolactin. study of mice with deletion of -endorphin showed that the male mice were obese and hyperphagic (9) this suggests that loss of -endorphin results in hyperphagia, highlighting an unexpected anorexigenic effect of endogenous -endorphin. -endorphin is involved in a motivational reward behavior in nondeprived conditions. -endorphin failed to antagonize the effects of melanocortins and -endorphin on energy balance. this suggests that processing has evolved in such a way to provide subtle regulation of active peptides in the hypothalamic neurons. N-POMC (1\u201328) stimulated cell division in primary bovine adrenal cells, Y1 cells, and human adrenal tumor cells (NCI-H295-R) there was no effect on adrenal growth, and no change in adrenal morphology, in a setting where ACTH (1\u201324) caused adrenocortical hypertrophy (75). full-length N-POMC was not active in stimulating adrenal growth. but the shorter N-POMC (1\u201328) was able to stimulate adrenal mitogenesis. this led to the hypothesis that N-POMC had to be cleaved to have effects on adrenal growth. this led to the hypothesis that this is the major NH2-terminal POMC peptide in the circulation. if fragments of the N-POMC peptides play a role in adrenal mitogenesis, it would have to be after cleavage at the adrenal gland. however, it seems that the human equivalent of AsP is not capable of this role. there is evidence for this in Pomc null mice where the adrenal glands undergo atrophy after birth. -MSH may not exist as a separate peptide because the COOH-terminal region does not have the dibasic amino acids to allow cleavage from the N-POMC region (114) it is tempting to speculate that if there is an enzyme which cleaves N-POMC at the adrenal to produce a peptide which promotes adrenal cortex mitogenesis then the same enzyme may also be present in the kidney to generate peptides that stimulate natriuresis. a peptide identical to joining peptide stimulated production of dihydro-epiandrostenedione (DHEA) from adult human adrenal cells (297) and was designated as the missing cortical androgen-stimulating hormone (CASH) there is very little evidence for a role for joining peptide. patients are given CRH (peripherally) and the resulting increase in ACTH in the petrosal sinuses draining the pituitary occurs within 2\u20133 min (277) this process must be stimulating release of preformed ACTH. ACTH travels in the circulation and acts on the adrenal gland to cause the release of cortisol in humans and corticosterone in rodents. the basal ACTH secretion has an indirect role in modulating circadian biology, most obviously through initiating the cortisol rhythms. this role is performed by a peptide from the NH2-terminal region of POMC (n-POMC 1\u201328) however, ACTH replacement in POMC knockout mice is sufficient to cause normal adrenal development (75). circulating -MSH is not produced by the human anterior pituitary. MC2R is expressed in human mesenchymal cells undergoing differentiation into adipocytes (377), and therefore, circulating ACTH may be involved. patients are given CRH (peripherally) and the resulting increase in ACTH occurs within 2\u20133 min (277) this process must be stimulating release of preformed ACTH. ACTH travels in the circulation and acts on the adrenal gland to cause the release of cortisol in humans and corticosterone in rodents. the basal ACTH secretion has an indirect role in modulating circadian biology, most obviously through initiating the cortisol rhythms. this role is performed by a peptide from the NH2-terminal region of POMC (n-POMC 1\u201328) but ACTH replacement in POMC knockout mice is sufficient to cause normal adrenal development (75). MC2R is expressed in human mesenchymal cells undergoing differentiation into adipocytes. it has been shown that POMC is synthesized by lymphocytes (34) and that ACTH is produced, suggesting that the processing of POMC follows a pattern similar to the anterior pituitary. -MSH does not bind with high affinity to the MC2R, so will not affect glucocorticoid release. it is also thought unlikely that -MSH from the hypothalamus gets into the circulation. however, there are reports of low levels of -MSH in human blood (172, 190) which may be skin-derived. all four peptides have similar potency in stimulating cAMP which is required for MC4R signaling. central administration of -MSH to POMC null mice reduced food intake to 35% of sham-treated animals and 3-day treatment reduced body weight (405) this confirms earlier studies where administration of -MSH to rodent brains reduced food intake. early work suggested that -MSH\u2019s immediate precursor, des-acetyl -MSH, was the major product in the arcuate nucleus with lesser amounts of -MSH and ACTH. -MSH predominated in the NTS in the brain stem (113, 114) -MSH from the pars intermedia of the pituitary in rodents. -MSH is not produced by human pituitaries. it is also thought unlikely that -MSH from the hypothalamus gets into the circulation. the role of -MSH in darkening of frog skin was recognized many years earlier. the role of -melanocyte stimulating factor in darkening of frog skin has led to the suggestion that this evolution of POMC processing in skin is equivalent to a primeval stress axis (361). processing steps have evolved to refine the regulation of energy balance. yl -MSH (at high doses) and ACTH, had similar effects (4, 189) this is controversial as there is also evidence that des-acetyl -MSH injected into the brain had no effect on food intake (1, 261, 404) this is controversial as there is also evidence that des-acetyl -MSH injected into the brain had no effect on food intake (1, 261, 404). the acetylation of des-acetyl -MSH to generate -MSH is regulated by leptin (156) and may be regulated by dopamine (127, 252, 410, 412), although others suggest this is not the case (95). there is evidence of a role for MC4R in mediating increased energy expenditure (48), oxygen consumption, and fuel oxidation. -LPH functions primarily as a precursor for -MSH and -endorphin. however, over the years, it has become established that -LPH functions primarily as a precursor for -MSH and -endorphin. evidence for a role for -MSH also comes from studies in humans with mutations in -MSH. a mutation in POMC creates a fusion protein of -MSH and -endorphin, preventing cleavage of these peptides. the cleavage of -endorphin to the COOH-terminally truncated -endorphin peptides is a mechanism to reduce opioid activity in tissues where other POMC peptides are released for non-opioid functions. the first indication that -endorphin acts at -opioid receptors was in 1976, when it was shown to be 100 times more potent than morphine (132) -endorphin has shown its presence in nerve terminals that extend dorsally and laterally. it can be found in the amygdala, colliculi, and hippocampus. there are very few reports linking how stimulation of POMC drives analgesia without releasing the melanocortin peptides. -MSH blocks both stress-induced and -endorphin-stimulated release of prolactin in rats (267) in monkeys, -MSH has a similar effect on -endorphin-induced prolactin and blocks the -endorphin-mediated decrease in luteinizing hormone (419). study of mice with deletion of -endorphin showed that the male mice were obese and hyperphagic (9) this suggests that loss of -endorphin results in hyperphagia, highlighting an unexpected anorexigenic effect of endogenous -endorphin. -endorphin is involved in a motivational reward behavior in nondeprived conditions (227) highest concentration of -endorphin in the brain is found in the hypothalamus. highest concentration of -endorphin in the brain is found in the arcuate nucleus. -LPH is cleaved by PC2 to give -LPH and -endorphin. -endorphin (1\u201331) is the major form and is active at -opioid receptors. the first indication that -endorphin acts at -opioid receptors was in 1976. it was shown to be 100 times more potent than morphine (132) this has been attributed to its sequence, which confers resistance to degradation. it could be considered another advantage of the presence of a peptide within a larger pro-hormone structure. mice with a targeted mutation inserted a premature stop codon in the POMC gene to prevent the synthesis of -endorphin. this does suggest that a stress activation of POMC would produce an analgesic response mediated by -endorphin. POMC in hypothalamic neurons will generate -endorphin. it is important to consider whether the -endorphin actions are synergistic with those of the melanocortins. if it is the latter, there may be processing mechanisms to inactivate -endorphin when melanocortins are activated, and vice versa. ize the concept that several peptides are produced simultaneously. -MSH and -MSH cause anorexigenic actions while -endorphin stimulates feeding. -endorphin failed to antagonize the effects of NDP-MSH. a fragment of human N-POMC increases rat adrenal gland weight and mitotic index. previous work had indicated that the full-length N-POMC peptide (1\u201376 in humans and 1\u201374 in rats) was not active (123). the most effective fragment was N-POMC (1\u201328), which had been isolated from human pituitaries as part of the purification of growth hormone (124) a group led by Phil Lowry (229) injected antisera raised to N-POMC (1\u201328) and to a synthetic 3-MSH peptide into rats. they found different effects on compensatory adrenal growth in the contralateral gland, following the removal of the other adrenal gland (229). this led to the hypothesis that N-POMC had to be cleaved to have effects on adrenal growth. the presence of full-length N-POMC in human plasma substantiates the evidence of a lack of cleavage in human pituitary cells. if fragments of the N-POMC peptides play a role in adrenal mitogenesis, it would have to be after cleavage at the adrenal gland. studies have shown that -MSH can have a hypertensive effect, acting via a central mechanism. but other studies have indicated the opposite effect. -MSH acts directly on MC3R in the kidney to play a role in natriuresis. -MSH plays a role in decreasing food intake. it is more difficult to determine the relative importance of -MSH peptides. it is predicted that 3-MSH and 2-MSH can be produced in the hypothalamus. N-POMC (1\u201328) stimulated cell division in primary bovine adrenal cells, Y1 cells, and human adrenal tumor cells (NCI-H295-R) there was no effect on adrenal growth, and no change in adrenal morphology, when N-POMC (1\u201328) was given to mice with a null mutation in the Pomc gene. a rat adrenal gland-derived trypsin-like enzyme called adrenal secretory protein (AsP) cleaves between valine and methionine. this enzyme would generate N-POMC (1\u201352) which can stimulate adrenal mitogenesis (28). this led to the hypothesis that N-POMC had to be cleaved to have effects on adrenal growth. the presence of full-length N-POMC in human plasma substantiates the evidence of a lack of cleavage in human pituitary cells. however, it seems that the human equivalent of AsP is not capable of this role. it may be that stimulation of growth of the adult adrenal cortex by POMC peptides is more physiologically relevant than it is in the fetus. -MSH may not exist as a separate peptide, because the COOH-terminal region does not have the dibasic amino acids to allow cleavage from the N-POMC region (114) it is tempting to speculate that an enzyme which cleaves N-POMC at the adrenal to produce a peptide which promotes adrenal cortex mitogenesis, then the same enzyme may also be present in the kidney to generate peptides that stimulate natriuresis. 2-MSH binds to the mouse MC3R (and MC5R) better than other MCRs (184). -MSH has comparable binding activity to -MSH at the human MC3R (reviewed in Ref. 198), so it is not clear which is the natural ligand. children give insight into the importance of the pro-hormone and the requirements for the different melanocortin peptides. earliest reports suggest mutations in the POMC gene were associated with obesity came from linkage studies in mexico. two patients were found with different heterozygous mutations in exon 2 of the POMC gene. these mutations interfered with the entry of POMC into the normal regulated secretory pathway. this disruption to the processing of POMC and the reduction in processed peptides were associated with the development of obesity. mutation would be predicted to lead to a loss of all POMC-derived peptides. of the 12 heterozygous relatives of the child, 11 were overweight or obese. other novel mutations in ACTH region of POMC have been described. mutations in the -MSH and -endorphin regions of the POMC gene have strong associations with obesity. patients have the characteristic hyperphagia and early-onset obesity associated with reduced binding to MCRs. mutations in PC1/3 cause severe hyperphagia leading to early-onset obesity. this is most likely related to the abnormal processing of POMC. mutations in PC1/3 have been shown to be authentic, bioactive ACTH. mutations in PC2 appear to be the only mutations in POMC processing enzymes associated with obesity in humans. no obese patients have been described with mutations in PC2. mutations leading to global loss of POMC peptides. one of the first patients described had a homozygous mutation at 3804 in exon 2. this created an additional out of frame start codon which abolished the translation of wild-type POMC. the clinical features observed in the patient are linked to the loss of binding of POMC-derived peptides to the MCRs in specific tissues. similar to the patient with the homozygous mutation in the noncoding region of POMC, this patient also had red hair, decreased cortisol, and obesity (207). the same research group later characterized two further children who also had mutations in the NH2-terminal region of POMC. mutations in the -MSH region of POMC have strong associations with obesity. mutations in the -MSH region of POMC have strong associations with obesity. mutations in the -MSH region of POMC have strong associations with obesity. the Y221C mutation was able to bind MC4R, but was unable to activate it. it was strongly associated with obesity, as 11 of 13 relatives with the same heterozygous mutation were obese. however, some noncarriers were also found to be overweight. one of the first patients described had a homozygous mutation at 3804 in exon 2. this created an additional out of frame start codon which abolished the translation of wild-type POMC. the clinical features observed in the patient are linked to the loss of binding of POMC-derived peptides to the MCRs in specific tissues. dicating a frame shift that would disrupt ACTH and -MSH binding motifs. this patient also had red hair, decreased cortisol, and obesity. the same research group later characterized two further children who also had mutations in the NH2-terminal region of POMC. mutations in the -MSH and -endorphin regions of the POMC gene Mutations in the -MSH region of POMC have strong associations with obesity. mutations in the -MSH region of POMC have strong associations with obesity. mutation in the -MSH region of POMC was strongly associated with obesity. mutations in PC1/3 cause severe hyperphagia leading to early-onset obesity. mutations in PC1/3 cause severe hyperphagia. PC1/3 mutations appear to be the only mutations in POMC processing enzymes associated with obesity in humans. nonsense mutation in PCSK1 has been reported to cause dominantly inherited obesity. both strains experienced embryonic lethality (56, 437), indicating the importance of POMC in development and maturation in utero. the loss of POMC has a significant impact on the metabolic phenotype of the mouse. acute administration of ACTH appeared insufficient to induce corticosterone production (188); however, a longer treatment period normalized adrenal weight and circulating corticosterone (74). in contrast, treatment with POMC (1\u201328) did not \u201crescue\u201d the adrenal glands (75). however, a longer treatment period normalized adrenal glands and circulating corticosterone (74). compared with knockout mice, these pituitary rescued POMC knockout mice developed hyperglycaemia and insulin resistance with hepatic steatosis (372), likely to be due to excess pituitary ACTH increasing glucocorticoids. reexpression of hypothalamic POMC at all ages effectively normalized the hyperphagia in global Pomc null mice. the role of PC1/3 in the cleavage of POMC in vivo was first elucidated in PC1/3 null mice developed in 2002. these mice have increased unprocessed POMC in the pituitary and a lack of processing to ACTH (291, 449), suggesting that perhaps the higher levels of POMC could compensate for the lack of ACTH. a single point mutation in the Psck1 gene led to a mouse with an obese phenotype. this strain was a normal size due to its ability to process pro-growth hormone-releasing hormone. males were 32% heavier and females 68% heavier than wild-type mice. the pituitary had reduced Pomc mRNA levels, but both the glycosylated and unglycosylated forms of POMC protein were increased (213, 300) the pituitary also contained increased amounts of -LPH and reduced amounts of its cleavage products -LPH and -endorphin due to the lack of processing (213) CPEfat/fat mice have a missense mutation in the gene for CPE at Ser202. phenotypically the mice had late-onset obesity and were hyperglycemic, but responded to exogenous insulin, demonstrating that pro-insulin processing was defective (263). changes in peptide levels in the hypothalamus had a functional effect on the body weight phenotype. this may be because there is missorting or because of altered levels of PC1/3 and PC2 in different brain regions of CPEfat/fat mice (23, 220). the loss of POMC has a significant impact on the metabolic phenotype of the mouse. both murine models were hyperphagic on low- and high-fat diets (56, 437) with administration of -MSH to one of the Pomc null models able to ameliorate the hyperphagia. the impact of loss of hypothalamic Pomc on body weight may have been tempered by lack of pituitary ACTH and therefore lack of corticosteroids. corticosterone supplementation normalized the circulating corticosterone in Pomc null mice, but significantly increased body fat and body weight further. pituitary rescued POMC knockout mice developed hyperglycaemia and insulin resistance with hepatic steatosis (372), likely to be due to the excess pituitary ACTH increasing glucocorticoids. another murine model was established that allowed for reexpression of hypothalamic POMC at different ages in global Pomc null mice. the role of PC1/3 in the cleavage of POMC in vivo was first elucidated in PC1/3 null mice developed in 2002. these mice have increased unprocessed POMC in the pituitary and a lack of processing to ACTH (291, 449), suggesting that perhaps the higher levels of POMC could compensate for the lack of ACTH. however, this has not been confirmed by other studies (387) a single point mutation in the Psck1 gene led to a mouse with an obese phenotype. this strain was a normal size due to its ability to process pro-growth hormone-releasing hormone. males were 32% heavier and females 68% heavier than wild-type mice. mice have increased unprocessed POMC in the pituitary and a lack of processing to ACTH (291, 449) however, there was no difference in corticosterone (449), suggesting that perhaps the higher levels of POMC could compensate for the lack of ACTH. the first PC1/3 null mice were not obese, unlike patients with mutations in the gene. mice developed obesity, and by 6 mo, males were 32% heavier and females 68% heavier than their wild-type littermates. the expression of the Pomc gene in Pcsk1-N222D hypomorph mice was similar to wild-type mice, but they had a 45% reduction in -MSH. there was also impaired processing in the pituitary, in that they had increased pro-ACTH levels compared with wild-type mice. des-acetyl -MSH, di-acetyl -MSH forms, and CLIP were also found at much lower levels than in wild-type mice (161). -MSH, des-acetyl -MSH, and CLIP were also found at much lower levels than in wild-type mice (161). in heart and duodenum there was no reduction in activity due to the activity of CPD, CPN, and/or CPM (137). the studies carried out on POMC in CPEfat/fat mice have helped elucidate the role of CPE as a sorting enzyme controlling the release of POMC. this strain is similar to the CPEfat/fat mice, in that they had late-onset obesity, hyperglycaemia, and higher levels of pro-insulin than insulin. however, the pituitary levels of ACTH and -MSH were also reduced, with higher levels of unprocessed POMC. the more extensive processing of POMC is substantiated by evidence that PC2 as well as PC1/3 is expressed in human and rodent skin (242, 305), in cultured epidermal melanocytes (305), and in human keratinocytes (333). the -MSH-LI was found to be ACTH (1\u20138), formed by tryptase digestion in the extracellular space. keratinocytes secrete -MSH-related peptides that act on cell surface MCRs on melanocytes to stimulate melanogenesis and proliferation. the role of -endorphin in stimulating melanogenesis, mitogenesis, and dendrite outgrowth suggests its function is very similar to that of. CRH is expressed in the skin (362, 365) and can act to stimulate POMC activity and corticosterone synthesis in dermal fibroblasts (367\u2013369) it has been suggested that the HPA axis represents an evolutionary development from the skin \u201cHPA axis\u201d (361). antibodies produced with specificity for specific peptides such as ACTH may detect POMC or pro-ACTH as well as ACTH when used in immunohistochemistry. some of our knowledge comes from rodents, and this might be difficult to extrapolate because they do not get same exposure to sunlight. there is always the question as to whether the tumors undergo abnormal processing of POMC and produce -MSH. this led us to question the relative release of POMC, ACTH, and -MSH by normal human epidermal keratinocytes, melanocytes, and hair follicle cells. the role of -endorphin in stimulating melanogenesis, mitogenesis, and dendrite outgrowth suggests its function is very similar to that of -MSH (191). CRH is expressed in the skin (362, 365) and can act to stimulate POMC activity and corticosterone synthesis. ides in Skin: Implications for Interpretation The evidence is compelling for the presence of the POMC peptides. but it may mask the true endogenous peptide networks between the cells and cause abnormal function. analysis of the peptides in tissues by immunohistochemistry is only as good as the knowledge of the specificity of the antibodies. the secretion of a hormone is almost always regulated by a series of mechanisms to tightly control release into the circulation. this adds another layer of complexity. for POMC, the three key stages are regulation of the gene, 2) the processing enzymes, and 3) the secretion from cells, as well as some cell-specific posttranslational processing. pulsatility is caused by a pulse-generator in a higher center such as the hypothalamus or hippocampus. this loop continues with the degradation of cortisol. this loop removes the glucocorticoid inhibition so that constant CRH stimulation can then increase the ACTH as part of the rising phase of the next pulse. glucocorticoid inhibition of ACTH secretion is independent of protein synthesis (195) and of POMC processing (115). the concentrations of ACTH in the human circulation show a distinct circadian rhythm, with highest levels just before wakening and then a decline throughout the day to a nadir between 11 p.m. and 3 a.m. y vesicles containing ACTH involve extracellular calcium influx and release from intracellular pools. the immediate release of ACTH from secretory vesicles combined with the stimulation of POMC synthesis leads to a biphasic response in humans. this has been documented in patients who undergo petrosal sinus sampling for a suspected ACTH secreting pituitary tumor. acute corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) stimulation in the anterior pituitary causes release of ACTH. POMC is also released but not subject to stimulation. CRH stimulation of the POMC gene in the anterior pituitary. more recent data have delineated a MAPK pathway that activates nuclear receptors related to NGFI-B. these bind to a Nur response element in a regulatory element at 404 bp. CRH signaling also activates Tif1 which is synergistic with SRC2 action. glucocorticoid inhibition of the HPA axis is one of the best examples of this tightly regulated feedback system. stress activation of the HPA axis must incorporate a mechanism to switch off glucocorticoid release, which if unrestrained would lead to prolonged immune suppression. glucocorticoids inhibit the calcium signaling, which triggers release of ACTH from the plasma membrane. glucocorticoids act on secretory vesicle release. glucocorticoids can inhibit POMC gene expression. the regulation of the POMC gene by glucocorticoids was first explored in the 1980s. a region necessary for repression was identified at 77 to 50 relative to the transcription start site of POMC. a second site between 480 and 320 was subsequently mapped. studies have reported that cannabinoid agonists increase circulating ACTH in animal models. the cannabinoid receptor CB1 is present on ACTH secreting cells. this suggests that cannabinoids are having a direct effect at the level of the pituitary. this loop continues with the degradation of cortisol, which then removes the glucocorticoid inhibition so that constant CRH stimulation can then increase the ACTH. the biological significance of the ultradian pulsatility is highlighted by studies showing that there are different effects on target genes if glucocorticoids are given constantly or in pulses. concentrations of ACTH in the human circulation show a distinct circadian rhythm. peak and trough values for ACTH differ by two- to threefold. cortisol can be four- to sixfold in healthy individuals. this may be because adrenal gland has sympathetic innervation. MC synthesis leads to a biphasic response in humans (93) after CRH stimulation, ACTH released into the petrosal sinus capillaries can be measured within minutes. POMC release from the pituitary can be detected, but it does not mimic the marked increase in ACTH (FIGURE 6) (148) CRH stimulation upregulates the POMC gene and release of ACTH. glucocorticoids (Gcs) can inhibit ACTH secretion in an acute, nongenomic manner in the anterior pituitary. MAPK signaling enables the Nur factors to bind SRC coactivators. CRH signaling also activates Tif1 which is synergistic with SRC2 action. there is very little evidence that processing of POMC to ACTH is regulated or that the pro-hormone convertase is stimulated by CRH. leukemia inhibitory factor activates POMC gene expression in rat anterior pituitary primary cultures. CRH stimulation of ACTH release from secretory vesicles leads to a biphasic response in humans. release from the pituitary can be detected, but it does not mimic the marked increase in ACTH (FIGURE 6) (148). it could be that in the steady state when there are sufficient ACTH vesicles, the excess POMC exits the cells by a constitutive pathway representing an \u201coverflow\u201d mechanism. this is substantiated in normal subjects where CRH caused an increase in circulating ACTH but no change in ACTH precursors. CRH stimulation of the POMC gene in the anterior pituitary. it is possible that stimulation of the POMC gene involves the same intermediary factors that act on the channels to cause ACTH secretion. early work defined the effect of CRH on cAMP pathways both in vitro and in vivo. arginine vasopressin (AVP) can synergize with CRH to stimulate ACTH release. but it does not appear to act on transcription of the gene. arginine vasopressin (AVP) is a key regulatory role in the HPA axis. glucocorticoid inhibition of the HPA axis is one of the best examples of this tightly regulated feedback system. glucocorticoid inhibition of the HPA axis is complex and some reports highlight the importance of regulation at the level of CRH in the hypothalamus. glucocorticoids inhibit the calcium signaling, which triggers release of ACTH from the plasma membrane. ANXA1 is released from folliculostellate cells in the pituitary in response to glucocorticoid stimulation. this causes translocation of ANXA1 to the outside of the cell by a mechanism that does not involve exocytosis. gs interact with Nur factors by protein-protein interactions. nGRE at 63 bp in the rat promoter is that it binds a GR homodimer as found in positive GREs. then a GR monomer binds to the opposite side of the helix in the promoter. glucocorticoids can inhibit POMC gene expression. they access the pituitary because it is outside the blood-brain barrier. they then diffuse into the corticotropes to bind the intracellular glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) studies in rats showed that adrenalectomy increased the mRNA levels of PC1/3 and that dexamethasone treatment of adrenalectomized animals reversed this. endocannabinoids are involved in stress recovery mechanisms and homeostasis; therefore, the effects are very dependent on the context. nonpituitary or ectopic tumors secrete predominantly ACTH precursors. the latter is referred to as ectopic ACTH syndrome, but we have suggested it should be renamed ectopic ACTH precursor syndrome (385). the tumors are often small cell lung carcinomas but can also be pancreatic, thyroid, or carcinoid tumors or pheochromocytomas. we developed a two-site immunoradiometric assay for ACTH precursors in 1988 (89), using a pair of monoclonal antibodies. one antibody binds to the ACTH region of POMC and the other to the -MSH region. this only occurs when POMC or pro-ACTH are present. this is very important in diagnostic ACTH assays. low concentrations of ACTH (1.0 pM) secreted continuously from tumors are thought to be able to cause elevated cortisol. this suggests that ACTH precursors were bioactive in this case. but we cannot completely rule out the possibility that the lack of detection of ACTH may be due to sensitivity limitations of the chromatography. a selection of tumors suggests that these tumors have the processing enzymes, PC1/3 and PC2, to cleave POMC to these smaller fragments. however, more recently, it has become clear that patients with less aggressive Cushing\u2019s syndrome caused by carcinoid tumors have elevated ACTH precursors (285) there are also \u201csilent\u201d tumors in patients who do not appear to have elevated ACTH in the circulation, but their tumors stain positively for \u201cACTH\u201d there is also some evidence for large invasive pituitary adenomas producing -MSH and most of these were immunopositive for PC2 (176). ectopic and pituitary tumors are often characterized by large dense-core secretory vesicles. this is supported by a study of 13 SCLC cell lines which had restricted expression of PC1/3 (87) most reported chromatograms show a major elution peak at the position for POMC and a shoulder to the peak, suggesting some pro-ACTH. it is very difficult to prove whether ACTH precursors or bona fide ACTH cause the clinical symptoms in these patients. ACTH precursors produce features of the ectopic ACTH syndrome. but other work using an assay specific for POMC suggested POMC was not present in the bronchial carcinoids they studied. if CLIP is present in a selection of tumors, this suggests that these tumors have the processing enzymes PC1/3 and PC2 to cleave POMC to these smaller fragments. a small subset of patients have much larger tumors, which tend to be invasive. they may present with vague symptoms of Cushing\u2019s syndrome and abnormally low ACTH results. a POMC specific assay has identified elevated POMC in seven of eight patients. pituitary adenoma secretes high concentrations of ACTH, often resulting in pigmentation. the ACTH precursors were elevated in 11 of the 24 patients (median 97.5 pM, range 26\u2013647 pM), compared with untreated Cushing\u2019s disease. however, the processing of POMC to ACTH appeared to be enhanced as evidenced by the ratio of precursors to ACTH (323) large invasive pituitary tumors can produce ACTH precursors at higher concentrations than ACTH. however, the lack of \u201cnatural\u201d glucocorticoid feedback inhibition may be influencing processing. antibodies are used to identify and concentrate the specific peptides. then SDS-gel electrophoresis determines the size of the peptides. this is a dynamic process studying the timing of the appearance and disappearance of the labeled peptides. the advent of a two-site immunoradiometric assay based on polyclonal antibodies to ACTH provided significant advantages (171) but the ability to generate monoclonal antibodies to ACTH (424) (FIGURE 9) enabled the characterization of a monoclonal antibody-based immunoradiometric assay (427) the ACTH assay uses a pair of MAbs which recognize the NH2 and COOH regions of ACTH. they can recognize these epitopes in POMC but only bind 2% of the precursors. however, the antibody may not recognize the ACTH sequence to the same degree in the larger precursor molecule. high levels of ACTH precursors can be found in the blood of patients with ectopic ACTH syndrome. the greater sensitivity of this approach allows ACTH precursors to be measured directly, without the need for chromatography. another immunometric assay for POMC showed greater heterogeneity. peptide may recognize the amino acid sequence in ACTH, pro-ACTH, and/or POMC. antibody recognizes the COOH terminal of ACTH and therefore detects ACTH and pro-ACTH but not POMC. this is made more relevant as the precursors are thought to be less biologically active. antibodies may recognize ACTH to a greater degree than the precursors. the different conditions used in immunoprecipitation can affect the relative recognition of the three peptides, so it is important to consider antibody specificity to interpret the data. monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) bind to specific epitopes on the peptides. a pair of MAbs is required for a two-site assay, which gives specificity. some tumors produced high-molecular-weight forms of ACTH. assays for ACTH can also detect high-molecular-weight forms of ACTH, such as POMC and pro-ACTH. however, the antibody may not recognize the ACTH sequence to the same degree in the larger precursor molecule. however, the ACTH assay may underestimate the concentration of POMC because of its low cross-reactivity with the antibodies. immunometric assay technology enables lower concentrations to be detected. this has made it possible to measure POMC in plasma (148, 285, 337) and in CSF (286, 403) from normal subjects. antibody recognizes COOH terminal of ACTH and therefore detects ACTH and pro-ACTH but not POMC. this has been proven in immunoassays and has been used in immunohistochemistry to show that a tumor was producing POMC but not ACTH. peptides used in bioassays for ACTH may only detect a few percent of the high-molecular-weight forms. this biases the ratio of bioactive to immunoactive peptide measured. pro-ACTH has 8\u201333% the potency of ACTH in a cytochemical bioassay. ACTH is able to act at the MC4R, found in the hypothalamus, with a similar potency to -MSH (311) POMC is less bioactive, but may still act if present at 100-fold higher concentrations. it is important to understand the relative concentrations of the precursors. the relative bioactivity of POMC and ACTH was addressed in the 1970s using POMC (then called pro-ACTH/endorphin) the peptides were purified by gel chromatography and SDS gel electrophoresis, then measured using an ACTH radioimmunoassay and tested on rat adrenocortical cells. pro-ACTH has 8\u201333% the potency of ACTH in a cytochemical bioassay. this suggests that having the ACTH sequence at the COOH-terminal end makes it more bioactive than when ACTH is flanked at both ends by other peptides. ACTH is able to act at the MC4R, found in the hypothalamus, with a similar potency to -MSH (311) POMC is less bioactive, but may still act if present at 100-fold higher concentrations. this level of excess is found in the CSF (287, 403). a complete understanding of the regulation of the POMC gene in the hypothalamus remains more elusive. a complete understanding of the regulation of the POMC gene in the hypothalamus remains more elusive. this review has provided evidence for regulation of the many enzymes involved in generating bioactive -MSH. stumbling blocks to a more complete knowledge of which POMC peptides are involved in particular physiological processes. this is a particular issue for immunoassays that rely on the specificity of the antibody. in the case of ACTH assays, their recognition of POMC or pro-ACTH is rarely understood. loss of -MSH rather than -MSH is more likely to be associated with an increased risk of obesity. however, the mutations reported have been in the heterozygous state. the inability to produce -MSH in rodents points to redundancy. acetyl -MSH is detected at higher concentrations than POMC and ACTH in rat hypothalamic extracts. -MSH is detected at higher concentrations than POMC and ACTH in rat hypothalamic extracts, but its levels are not regulated by fasting. this again highlights some gaps in our understanding of POMC processing. this review has highlighted several reasons why it is difficult to make these assumptions. the early studies assessing the bioactivity of POMC and pro-ACTH have suggested that these precursors may only have low bioactivity at the MC2R. it is also likely that higher molecular weight precursors will have a longer half-life. this review has highlighted the uncertainty around the respective roles of - and -MSH. there is no doubt that loss of the complete POMC gene is associated with obesity. however, it is more difficult to understand the contribution of - and -MSH in patients with mutations in these regions. early literature suggests des-acetyl -MSH is the major form in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. there is a suggestion that the des-acetyl -MSH peptide travels within the POMC neurons from the arcuate nucleus to the PVN and then the N-acetyltransferase acts at the neuronal terminals in the PVN just before release from the neuron. ACTH precursors may not be regulated to the same degree as ACTH. this is particularly true in cases of ectopic ACTH syndrome where ACTH concentrations are normal or slightly elevated. this is particularly true in those cases of ectopic ACTH syndrome where ACTH precursors are high. POMC is an archetypal hormone precursor, delivering exquisite physiological control to complex multiorgan processes.
