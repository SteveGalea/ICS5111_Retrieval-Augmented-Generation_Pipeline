{"summary": "influenza viruses are disease-causing agents in humans and animals. they are classified using the antigenic characteristic of the envelope glycoproteins haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) of the 17 haemagglutinin subtypes only two cause seasonal epidemics in the human population. cleavage at the single arginine amino acid at the HA cleavage site of low pathogenicity avian influenza strains is thought to be mediated by tissue-specific proteases. different human lung proteases belonging to the serine protease family that are able to cleave the haemagglutinin of LPAI strains are still unidentified. evolutionary analysis involving 17 amino acid sequences representing HAs from each subtype was conducted in MEGA5 (Tamura et al, 2011) the evolutionary history was inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method. all positions with less than 100% site coverage were eliminated. cell line Human embryonic kidney HEK293T/17 cells were cultured in DMEM. plasmid p8.91, the firefly luciferase expressing plasmid pCSFLW, the HA expressing plasmid and the pCAGGS-TMPRSS2 were co-transfected into human embryonic kidney HEK293T/17 cells. Pseudotyped particles were also produced in the absence of pCAGGS-TMPRSS2 plasmid (TMPRSS2). Titration was performed by transducing HEK293T/17 cells (1 104 cells/well) with 50 l of neat pseudotype supernatant. a 'cell only' control and a 'pseudotype only' control were used in each assay. 1 104 HEK293T/17 cells were added to each well. the plates were incubated for a further 48 hrs at 37\u00b0C. reference sera avian sera against H3N8, H4N8, H14N5, H10N1 and H15N9 were produced in specific pathogen-free chickens as described elsewhere. human embryonic kidney HEK293T/17 cells were cultured in DMEM with Glutamax and high glucose. co-transfected into human embryonic kidney HEK293T/17 cells using Fugene-6 transfection reagent (Roche, UK) after 24 hours incubation, 1U of recombinant neuraminidase from Clostridium perfringens (Sigma) was added. forty-eight hours post-transfection supernatant was harvested, filtered through 0.45 m filters and stored at -80\u00b0C. luminescence of cell cultures (in relative luminescence units or RLUs) was evaluated by luminometry using the Bright-Glo assay system (Promega, UK) the results were normalized and expressed as the percentage of inhibition of pseudotype virus entry (neutralization) using the cell only and pseudotype only control values. choslovakia/1956 (H4N6), A/chicken/Germany/N49 (H10N7), A/mallard/Astrakhan/263/1982 (H14N5), A/shearwater/West Australia/2576/1979 (H15N9) and H7 LPAI virus A/chicken/Italy/1082/1999 (H7N1). notably, H3, H4 and H10 pseudotypes were produced with titres above TMPRSS2 is a protease that is able to cleave human influenza haemagglutinins. TPCK-Trypsin is able to activate haemagglutinin by proteolitic cleavage. TMPRSS2 activates HA on pseudotype particles by specific cleavage. human TMPRSS2 activates the haemagglutinin of different influenza A subtypes. TMPRSS2 homologous proteins are able to cleave human influenza HA. further studies need to be performed to determine the function of TMPRSS2 and other proteases (e.g., HAT) cleavage motif P[E,G][K,V,I]XX[K,R], with the numbers and physicochemical properties of the central aminoacidic residues between the proline and the cleavage arginine/lysine variable between subtypes. cleavage motif P[E,G][K,V,I]XX[K,R], with the numbers and physicochemical properties of the central aminoacidic residues between the group-2 influenza pseudotypes described in this paper could be used as tools to test the activity of these compounds in a pre-clinical screening phase. the group-2 influenza pseudotype particles could also be used to study the antibody response directed against haemagglutinin. group-2 influenza pseudotypes were produced against different strains from the H7 pseudotype strain. this is related to the origin of the antisera: they were generated against different H7 virus strains from the H7 pseudotype strain. the group-2 influenza pseudotype particle neutralization assay could be used as an efficient serological surveillance assay. it could be used as an efficient serological surveillance assay."}
