{"summary": "the genus Mammarenavirus has been divided into Old World (OW) and New World (NW) viral groups based on phylogenetic, serological, and geographical distribution differences. clade B contains many important human pathogens, including Junn virus (JUNV) and Machupo, Sabia, Guaranito, and Chapare viruses. arenaviruses are enveloped, bisegmented, negative-strand RNA viruses. each genomic RNA segment (L, 7.3 kb, and S, 3.5 kb) contains two open reading frames (ORFs) with opposite (ambisense) orientations divided by a noncoding intergenic region. autophagy is an essential lysosomal degradation pathway that controls cellular homeostasis by eliminating protein aggregates and damaged organelles from the cytoplasm. the pathway begins with the formation of isolation membranes in the cytoplasm known as phagophores, which elongate and surround the cytoplasmic cargo to form double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes. autophagosomes fuse with the acidic lysosomes to form the autolysosome. degradation and recycling of the resulting macromolecules occur. many highly successful pathogens have evolved mechanisms to evade the deleterious autophagic effects. RESULTS JUNV infection activates the autophagy pathway. the cytosolic LC3 form (LC3I) undergoes a process modifying it into a phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated form (LC3II). bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) blocks the autophagy flux with a concomitant increase in the levels of LC3-II; rapamycin (RAP), a widely used compound that induces autophagy. a small fraction of processed LC3II was detected under normal conditions, whereas processed LC3II was significantly increased in cells after exposure to BafA1, RAP, EBSS, or EBSS plus BafA1. al antibodies against JUNV nucleoprotein, which specifically recognize JUNV NP, were employed to estimate the infection progress. as expected, JUNV NP was detected from 9 h postinfection (p.i.) and increased during the 24 h of infection. the results shown in Fig. 1B demonstrate a significant increase in LC3-II levels in JUNV-infected cells relative to mock-treated cells. at 5 and 11 h p.i., BafA1 was added for 1 h before processing. rabbit polyclonal anti-LC3 antibody, monoclonal antibodies against the JUNV NP, and a monoclonal antibody against -tubulin were used. monolayers of the human cell line A549 were treated for 2 h with EBSS, RAP, or WORT. the cells were infected with JUNV at an MOI of 1, fixed at 24 h p.i.. a different set of monolayers were immunostained for detection of the viral NP. mCherry-GFP-LC3-transfected cells were infected with JUNV at an MOI of 1. the numbers of autophagosomes (GFP+, mCherry+, or yellow puncta) and autophagolysosomes (GFP, mCherry+, or red puncta) were determined by using confocal microscopy images. two-tailed ANOVA with Tukey\u2019s test contrast was used to determine statistical significance. the ratio of red dots to yellow dots was also determined as a measure of the autophagy flux. representative images were taken using a confocal microscope (Olympus FV 1000) at both 24 and 48 h p.i., infected WT MEFs showed a clear punctate pattern for endogenous LC3. the percentage of infected cells was significantly lower in atg5/ MEFs than in WT MEFs at both times p.i. analyzed. at 48 h p.i., we observed significant recovery of the percentage of infected cells. at 24 and 48 h p.i., the supernatants were collected, and the cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence using LC3 (red) and NP (green) antibodies. the numbers of infected cells were determined and then related to the control treatment (panel C) phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) is generated by the enzymatic activity of the Beclin 1-PtdIns3K complex and recruited to the membrane for autophagosome formation. however, increasing evidence suggests that specific noncanonical autophagy can be induced independently of Beclin 1 or PtdIns3K in several cell types by specific stimulants or infection by pathogens. cells were infected with a plasmid encoding a pSuper Beclin 1 construct or the empty construct. cells were fixed, immunostained for the viral NP, and analyzed by epifluorescence microscopy. a549 cells were transfected with the empty vector, pSuper. monoclonal antibodies against beclin 1, -tubulin, and -tubulin were used. corresponding peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were used. a representative experiment from three independent experiments is shown. UV-inactivated JUNV infection does not induce LC3-II lipidation. at 6 h p.i. with UV-inactivated JUNV, the vast majority of cells showed weak or absent specific GP signal. this is probably due to lysosomal degradation of the inactivated particles. WORT treatment caused a decrease in the number of puncta of EGFP-LC3 per cell. cells were mock treated or treated with EBSS, 100 nM BafA1, 100 nM RAP, or 100 nM WORT or infected with JUNV or UV-inactivated JUNV. after 2 h of treatment and at 2 or 6 h p.i., the cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence assay. the cytosolic LC3 form (LC3I) undergoes a process modifying it into a phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated form (LC3II), which can associate with the autophagosomal membranes (25). monolayers of the human cell line A549 were mock treated or treated for 2 h with bafilomycin A1 (BafA1), which blocks the autophagy flux. whereas processed LC3II was significantly increased in cells after exposure to BafA1, RAP, EBSS, or EBSS plus BafA1. WORT treatment caused inhibition of the pathway with less accumulation of the LC3-II form than with control-treated cells. we performed a time course infection (2, 6, 9, 12, and 24 h of infection) an increase in LC3-II levels after BafA1 treatment of infected cells compared to 6 or 12 h p.i. without BafA1 treatment. similar results were obtained when we inhibited lysosomal proteolysis. we used pepstatin A as an alternative approach. samples were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence assay to detect viral NP. a representative experiment from three independent experiments is shown. the percentage of infected cells was significantly higher in the monolayers pretreated with EBSS or RAP. the WORT treatment exerted a partial effect on infection, but did not observe statistical significance. the results suggest that JUNV infection induces the autophagy pathway early p.i., with a proviral role of the pathway. the autophagolysosome/autophagosome ratio was determined for each condition and employed to analyze the effect of JUNV infection on the pathway. we observed a significant increase in the total number of autophagic structures with a ratio similar to that under EBSS conditions after 2, 6, and 24 h of infection. atg5/, atg5/, and atg5-overexpressing atg5/ MEFs showed a punctate distribution of endogenous LC3 protein after EBSS treatment. at both 24 and 48 h p.i., infected cells showed a clear punctate pattern for endogenous LC3 and the viral protein NP. atg5/ and atg5-complemented atg5/ MEFs were infected with JUNV at an MOI of 1. both types of MEF and the Atg5-complemented atg5/ MEFs were infected with JUNV at an MOI of 1. atg5/ MEFs showed higher basal levels of LC3-I than WT MEFs. atg5/ MEFs showed higher basal levels of LC3-I than WT MEFs. autophagy-related proteins Atg5 and Atg7 play important roles in conventional autophagy. we used a plasmid carrying a small interfering RNA against Beclin 1 (pSuper Beclin 1-KD, referred to as Beclin 1-KD), which causes knockdown of transfected cells after 48 h. at 24 h posttransfection, the cells were infected with JUNV at an MOI of 1, and infection was allowed to proceed for a total of 24 h. the presence of the virus inside the host cells triggers the induction of the canonical (Beclin 1-dependent) pathway by stimulation of autophagosome biogenesis without significantly affecting the autophagic flux. in all cases, a representative experiment from three independent experiments is shown. infected cells were treated with pEGFP-LC3, and 24 h posttransfection. cells were fixed and processed for direct confocal microscopy analysis of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-LC3. the cells showed weak or absent specific GP signal, probably due to lysosomal degradation of the inactivated particles. EGFP\u2013LC3-II conversion in A549 cells infected with JUNV or UV-inactivated JUNV was analyzed. significant increases in the EGFP\u2013LC3-II/tubulin ratio were observed only when the virus was infective. the data represent means and SE. a representative experiment from three independent experiments is shown. DISCUSSION The autophagy pathway is a crucial component of host defense against viral infection. the virion is endocytosed, and the viral and endosomal membranes fuse. this fusion event promotes viral uncoating, allowing the viral core to initiate its replication in the cytoplasm. we assayed BafA1 treatments in JUNV infections at 5 and 11 h p.i. viruses have developed strategies to avoid autophagy-mediated immune responses. the autophagic pathway and/or components of the autophagy machinery have been implicated in proviral roles for several RNA and DNA viruses. the precise molecular mechanisms of most proviral activities are scarcely known in vast majority of cases. caused ER stress due to levels of RNA synthesis and protein production higher than those in infection with rJUNV expressing the GPC protein of the pathogenic Romero strain of JUNV. they additionally showed that the impaired processing and altered trafficking of candid no. 1 GPC were the causes of ER stress promotion and final apoptosis (52). we analyzed intracellular CNX level as a marker of UPR-ER in infected cells. innate immune response activation mediated by TLR-2 is independent of virus replication. innate immune response activation mediated by TLR-2 is characterized by increased transcription levels of interferon beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha (54) human lung epithelial A549 cells were grown in MEM (Life Technologies, Argentina) containing 10% heat-inactivated FCS and supplemented with 50 g/ml gentamicin. incubated at 37\u00b0C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. the naturally attenuated Junn virus strain IV4454 (58), employed in all the experiments, was propagated in Vero cells (ATCC no.
