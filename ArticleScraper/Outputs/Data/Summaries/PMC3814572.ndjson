{"summary": "CHIKV virions have a spherical capsid with icosahedral symmetry surrounded by a lipid bilayer envelope. two viral glycoproteins embedded in the envelope, E2 and E1, direct the attachment to the host cell membrane. CHIKV is transmitted between human hosts by blood-feeding female mosquitoes of the Aedes species. clinical symptoms of CHIKV are similar to that of other arthrogenic alphaviruses like Sindbis virus (SINV), Mayaro virus (ONNV) and Ross River virus (RRV) CHIKV was first isolated in Tanganyika (now called Tanzania) in 1953 [9], and has become endemic in Africa, India and Southeast Asia. several imported cases of CHIKF have also been reported in Europe [10] CHIKV infection is more commonly associated with prolonged arthralgia. classical and severe dengue manifest hemorrhagic symptoms. chikungunya vaccine strategies have been explored. a large collection of substances, from small molecules to natural products, can be evaluated for antiviral activity in a relatively short amount of time. the assay uses resazurin, an oxidized, non-fluorescent blue dye that is converted to the reduced, and highly fluorescent pink-colored resorufin through oxidation-reduction reaction, to measure cellular metabolic activity and cell viability. the mosquito cell line C6/36 Aedes albopictus clone (CRL-1660) was maintained at 28\u00b0C in leibovitz's L-15 medium (Gibco Invitrogen, USA) it was supplemented with 5% FBS, 0.26% tryptose phosphate broth (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and 25 g/mL gentamicin sulfate (Gibco In resazurin was dissolved in cell-Gro molecular grade water. cell viability was determined by treating with 10 M resazurin. cell viability was determined by treating with 10 M resazurin. resazurin readouts were reported as relative fluorescence units (RFU) the fluorescence readouts were reported as relative fluorescence units (RFU) a plaque assay adapted from previously published method was titrated by plaque assay. the wells were fixed with 4% PFA containing 5 g/mL 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) for 30 min at room temperature, then washed twice with 80 L DPBS and finally filled with 50 L DPBS. cell viability of DAPI-stained nuclei from 5 different fields of the wells was determined by resazurin reduction assay. nuclei in DAPI Images are peaks rather than basins, the process is applied to the inverted image. the output is an image where each nuclei region is identified by a unique color. a cell is considered infected if at least half of its nucleus overlap with the positive GFP signal. CHIKV-infected HuH-7 treated with test compounds, 0.5% DMSO vehicle (negative control), and MOCK-infected HuH-7 (positive control), respectively. a Z'-factor >0.5 between the positive and negative controls indicates a statistically reliable separation between the positive and negative controls. a CV 10% reflects a low degree of variability within the group. the plates were incubated under humidified conditions at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 for 72 hrs, then analyzed by resazurin reduction assay. the dose-response curves of the reference compounds were determined by infecting HuH-7 cells with CHIKV-118-GFP. the bioFocus compounds, CPZ and DMSO vehicle were spotted onto the 384-well clear-plate black using the Cybi-Well liquid handler. first, freshly trypsinized HuH-7 cell suspension was inoculated with CHIKV-118-GFP (M.O.I. of 0.5) or virus medium. percent infection and cell number was determined using an image-based immunofluorescence detection of dengue E protein in infected cells by flavivirus group-specific E monoclonal antibody 4G2 and nuclei staining with DAPI. compounds that showed DENV2 inhibition 80% and exhibited 50% toxicity based on cell number at 10 M were considered positive hits. varying concentrations of the hit compounds were added into the culture medium without cells then analyzed by resazurin reduction assay. the titer of infectious progeny virions released into the culture medium was determined by plaque assay. the microneutralization assay was performed to assess the protection conferred by the hit compounds against CHIKV-induced cytopathic effect. CHIKV-118-GFP was inoculated at a M.O.I. of 0.5 in the presence of 50 M MPA, 50. hepatocarcinoma epithelial cells HuH-7 (JCRB0403), a kind gift from Dr. Katja Fink, was maintained under humidified conditions at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 medium containing 25 mM HEPES. the mosquito cell line C6/36 Aedes albopictus clone (CRL-1660), a generous gift from Dr. Claudia Nuez Duarte dos Santos, was escence protein (GFP) gene inserted at junction region of viral genome. previously rescued by transfecting recombinant viral genomic RNA. passedaging thrice in BHK21. cell viability was determined by treating with 10 M resazurin and incubating for 12 hrs at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2. resazurin to resorufin was terminated with 3% (w/v) paraformaldehyde fixative, incubated for 30 min at room temperature. excess inoculum was removed and the wells were filled with 0.5 mL overlay medium - RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS, antibiotic solution and 1.6% carboxymethylcellulose. the wells were fixed with 4% PFA at room temperature for 30 min then stained with 0.1% crystal violet solution (0.1% w/v crystal violet, 2.5% ethanol in DPBS; crystal violet and ethanol were both purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, USA) cell viability was determined by confocal fluorescence imaging using Operetta. CHIKV high-content assay analysis is based on image acquired by measuring two different channels: DAPI-stained nuclei and GFP-expressing cells signals. percentage of CHIKV-infected cells is defined as the ratio between the detected nuclei overlapping with the positive GFP signal. the percentage of CHIKV-infected cells is defined as the ratio between the detected nuclei overlapping with the positive GFP signal and the total number of detected nuclei. positive and negative control groups indicates statistically reliable separation between positive and negative controls. CV 10% reflects a low degree of variability within the group. wells were spotted with 5 M MPA or 0.5% DMSO vehicle. e-response curves for the percent inhibition and percent viability were generated using GraphPad Prism 5.04 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA) curve fitting, EC50 (concentration showing 50% inhibition) and CC50 (concentration showing 50% toxicity) values were elucidated using the software's non-linear regression function. primary hits were selected using a statistical cut-off based on the percent viability of the DMSO vehicle control. the statistical cut-off value was determined using the formula: where (%viability)DMSO and 4 (%viability)DMSO are the mean and 4 standard deviations of the DMSO vehicle control. HuH-7 cells were seeded in 384-well clear-plate black. the plates were kept under humidified conditions at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 for 72 hrs. resazurin reduction assay was performed using a molecule-clustering module. HuH-7 cells grown to confluence in 96-well Costar flat bottom plates were treated with 50 M MPA, 50 M CQ, 20 M hit compounds or 0.5% DMSO vehicle. after 1 hour, excess inoculum was removed and the wells were replenished. the endpoint was defined as the lowest concentration of the compound that inhibited CHIKV-induced CPE. image-based high-content assay of CHIKV Infectivity CHIKV-118-GFP infection of HuH-7 in the presence of hit compounds for 24 hours was analyzed. cell viability was determined by measuring the reduction of resazurin to the highly fluorescent resorufin by metabolically active and viable cells. the effect of CHIKV-118-GFP infection (M.O.I. of 0.5) on cell number and cell viability was measured at 24, 48, 72 and 96 hrs post-infection. CHIKV-infected HuH-7 showed higher fluorescence readout (398,57913,294 RFU), but was still significantly lower than that of MOCK-infected HuH-7 (801,58722,230 RFU). it has been reported previously that short-term resazurin reduction occurs in dying cells caused by the production of free and unpaired electrons. the average Z'-factor between the CHIKV-infected 0.5% DMSO vehicle and 5 M MPA-treated groups was 0.5780.075. the average Z'-factor between the CHIKV-infected 0.5% DMSO vehicle and 5 M MPA-treated groups was 0.460 to 0.703. the average Z'-factor between the CHIKV-infected 0.5% DMSO vehicle and MOCK-infected groups was 0.6450.059 a bell-shaped curve was observed for the percent inhibition as the concentration of CQ approached 100 M and coincided with the steep decline in percent viability at 100 M. MPA showed an EC50 value of 1.6 M, with no observable cytotoxicity at the highest concentration tested (100 M) a total of 72 compounds from the bioFocus kinase inhibitor library showed 70% viability in the CHIKV high-throughput screening. a total of 72 compounds from the bioFocus kinase inhibitor library showed 70% viability in the CHIKV high-throughput screening and were selected as primary hits. compound CND1611 (59.85% inhibition) was previously identified as a primary hit against DENV2 (100% inhibition, 44.57% toxicity at 10 M) follow-up on this compound was discontinued after hit confirmation by dose-response curve did not reveal any clear antiviral activities against CHIKV. CHIKV primary hits represent 99.7% (3) of the CHIKV-infected HuH-7 wells. the green dotted lines represent the statistical cut-off used for selecting primary hits (70% viability) the antiviral activity of the 72 primary hits in the CHIKV high-throughput screening was confirmed by measuring their inhibitory property and toxicity at different concentrations. values of the 6 confirmed hit compounds are summarized in Table 1. Activity profile of the 6 confirmed hit compounds against CHIKV based on resazurin reduction assay. CHIKV-118-GFP is a recombinant virus that has a GFP reporter gene. the gene is transcribed as a separate subgenomic mRNA from the 26S subgenomic mRNA by utilizing its own 26S subgenomic promoter. expression of the green fluorescence protein indicates infection of the host cell with CHIKV. a positive signal from the DAPI channel (D) is determined using a threshold value to generate the GFP foreground (E) CHIKV-infected cells are identified by the overlap between nuclei identified in C and GFP foreground in E (F) and the percentage of nuclei of infected cells is defined by the ratio between nuclei in F and C. ND0545 inhibited 28.3% of infection at 20 M. morphology of CHIKV-infected cells showed less apoptotic blebs compared to those treated with the DMSO vehicle control. cells were infected with 50 pfu CHIKV-118-GFP in the presence of compound CND0364 or CND0545. cells were stained with 0.1% crystal violet solution to observe clearance of the cell monolayer caused by virus infection. cell viability was determined by measuring the reduction of resazurin to the highly fluorescent resorufin. CHIKV-118-GFP infection of HuH-7 cells started showing significant reduction in cell number beginning from 48 hpi compared with MOCK-infection (P0.0001) the percent reduction in the average number of cells resulting from CHIKV-118-GFP infection was 65%, 90%, and 95% at 48, 72, and 96 hpi. treatment with 50 M CPZ dramatically reduced the cell number by 86% after 24 hrs. DAPI-stained nuclei of MOCK-infected, CHIKV-infected and CPZ-treated HuH-7 cells observed using Operetta at 20 magnification (A) average number of cells per field based on detected nuclei (B) DMSO vehicle control group showed a CV slightly higher than 10%, the Z'-factors between the MOCK-infected and 0.5% DMSO vehicle control groups were >0.5 in all 15 test plates. findings demonstrate the reliability of the resazurin reduction assay for use in CHIKV high-throughput screening. the underlying mechanism for this observed phenomenon has not been elucidated. the underlying mechanism for this observed phenomenon has not been elucidated. the average percent viability of CHIKV-infected HuH-7 cells treated with 0.5% DMSO vehicle from plate to plate ranges between 33.99%7.51% and 38.36%7.39%. a total of 72 compounds from the BioFocus kinase inhibitor library showed 70% viability in the CHIKV high-throughput screening. dots represent normalized RFU of MOCK-infected HuH-7 with 0.5% DMSO vehicle (brown), CHIKV-infected HuH-7 with 0.5% DMSO vehicle (yellow), CHIKV-infected HuH-7 with 10 M BioFocus compounds (red) or MOCK-infected HuH-7 with 50 M CPZ (blue) (A) 6 confirmed hit compounds showed EC50 values ranging from 2.2 M to 7.1 M based on the 50% inhibition relative to the maximum inhibition achieved by each compound. none of the confirmed hits exhibited significant toxicity in HuH-7 cells at the highest concentration tested. CHIKV-118-GFP is a recombinant virus that has a GFP reporter gene with its own 26S subgenomic promoter inserted into the viral genomic RNA. expression of the green fluorescence protein indicates infection of the host cell with CHIKV and the proper functioning of the viral replicase. more than 50% infected cells were detected at 18 hpi. more than 98% infected cells within 24 hpi. image-based high-content assay was used to evaluate antiviral activity of the 6 confirmed hit compounds. CHIKV-118-GFP were evaluated by image analysis using the customized plug-in on the Image Mining platform. Chloroquine inhibited CHIKV-118-GFP infection by 75.6% at 50 M. none of the 6 hit compounds showed significant inhibition of CHIKV-118-GFP infection in HuH-7. monolayer caused by CHIKV-118-GFP infection of HuH-7 in the presence of 20 M hit compounds, 50 M MPA or 50 M CQ. the percentages of infected cells are indicated on the lower right of each image (A) chloroquine showed inhibitory properties against CHIKV infection in vitro. it has a narrow selectivity index in cell cultures. a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial for treatment of acute chikungunya infections in La R\u00e9union with chloriquine did not show any significant benefits. resazurin reduction assay assesses cell viability by measuring the metabolic capacity of these cells to reduce resazurin to the highly fluorescent resorufin. in viable eukaryotic cells, the conversion of resazurin to resorufin is facilitated by mitochondrial reductases and diaphorases such as dihydrolipoamine dehydrogenase (EC 1.8.1.4,), NAD(P the resazurin reduction assay was used to identify potential CHIKV inhibitors by measuring cell viability. resazurin reduction assay used an infectious recombinant CHIKV (CHIKV-118-GFP) that is highly cytopathic in HuH-7 cells. persistence of arthralgia has been attributed to the ability of the virus to evade the host immune response by different mechanisms. CHIKV particles have been shown to hide in apoptotic blebs of infected cells and invade neighboring cells or cells otherwise refractory to CHIKV alone. the number of observed apoptotic blebs associated with CHIKV-118-GFP was significantly lower when treated with the reference compound MPA. the exact role of cellular kinases in promoting CHIKV-induced apoptosis remains poorly understood. the work present here describes the application of a cell-based high-throughput assay system using resazurin and an image-based high-content assay approach to screen a kinase-focused chemical library for potential inhibitors of CHIKV. compounds that interfere with CHIKV-induced CPE, which have been shown to play a role in the efficient dissemination of the virus, were identified. percent inhibition of 72 primary hits against CHIKV infection in HuH-7 at 10 M and percent inhibition/toxicity against DENV2 determined by image-based analysis of DENV2 infection in Huh-7.5. shades indicate the following range: 50% inhibition or >50% toxicity (red), 50%\u201380% inhibition and 50% toxicity (yellow), >80% inhibition and 50% toxicity (green).
