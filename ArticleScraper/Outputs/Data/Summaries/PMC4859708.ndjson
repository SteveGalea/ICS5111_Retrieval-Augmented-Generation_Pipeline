{"summary": "ZIKV is an enveloped virus with an approximately 10.7-kb positive-sense RNA genome. the ZIKV genome encodes a single polyprotein that is cleaved posttranslationally by host and viral proteases into three structural proteins. the viral nonstructural proteins regulate viral transcription and replication and also attenuate host antiviral responses. multiple monkey species in the Zika forest were found to be seropositive for ZIKV (11) small mammals in the Zika forest did not show serological evidence of ZIKV infection. there is evidence of high rates of ZIKV seroprevalence in Africa and Asia (9, 14\u201317), although the specificity of such assays is uncertain. the virus came to Brazil from polynesia via a viremic traveler or an infected mosquito (2, 26, 28, 29) the virus is abundant in Brazil, and autochthonous transmission was established. the rate at which ZIKV has spread through Latin America and the Caribbean appears comparable to that seen with chikungunya virus (CHIKV) ZIKV has been isolated from many species of Aedes mosquito. only a subset of these are competent vectors for transmission. it is unclear whether ZIKV will become endemic in New World monkeys. the typical course of ZIKV infection is illustrated (green background), with potential severe effects requiring further investigation indicated (blue background). a ZIKV viremic donor could potentially contaminate the blood supply (45, 46), and cases of ZIKV transmission through transfusions of donated blood have been reported in Brazil. RNA in urine even after viremia has cleared (57), could be consistent with ZIKV replication in urogenital tissues. pigs can develop high viral loads in the tonsils and transmit JEV through oronasal secretions. presence of virus in semen warrants investigation. microcephaly is a congenital abnormality in which the fetal brain is underdeveloped (72, 73) microcephaly can be asymmetric, meaning a small head on an otherwise normally proportioned body, or symmetric, meaning that the small head is proportional to a small overall body size. microcephaly can be diagnosed by prenatal ultrasound, but generally not until the late second trimester. the case definition for microcephaly has changed over the course of the current outbreak. in December 2015, the Brazilian Ministry of Health adopted a newborn head circumference measurement of 32 cm as the case definition. accumulating evidence strongly suggests a causal role for ZIKV in the development of microcephaly. a recent report of anti-ZIKV IgM in the cerebral spinal fluid of 12 infants with microcephaly also supports the hypothesis of in utero infection with ZIKV. in utero infection with WNV has been studied, with no clear evidence of an association with microcephaly. there are an estimated >390 million DENV infections occurring annually (including an estimated 25 million in Brazil [90]) pregnancies have been variable, including early pregnancy loss, elective termination, delivery of an infant with severe microcephaly, and seemingly unaffected infants. many unanswered questions remain concerning in utero transmission of ZIKV infection and development of microcephaly. the typical course of ZIKV infection is illustrated (green background), with potential severe effects requiring further investigation indicated (blue background) a ZIKV viremic donor could potentially contaminate the blood supply (45, 46), and cases of ZIKV transmission through transfusions of donated blood have been reported in Brazil. all cases of sexually transmitted ZIKV (34) could be consistent with ZIKV replication in urogenital tissues. recent reports of infectious ZIKV in urine could be consistent with ZIKV replication in urogenital tissues. microcephaly is a congenital abnormality in which the fetal brain is underdeveloped (72, 73) microcephaly can be asymmetric, meaning a small head on an otherwise normally proportioned body, or symmetric, meaning that the small head is proportional to a small overall body size. the long-term effects of microcephaly can vary widely. the case definition for microcephaly has changed over the course of the current outbreak. accumulating evidence strongly suggests a causal role for ZIKV in the development of microcephaly. accumulating evidence strongly suggests a causal role for ZIKV in the development of microcephaly. a recent report of anti-ZIKV IgM in the cerebral spinal fluid of 12 infants with microcephaly also supports the hypothesis of in utero infection with ZIKV. in utero infection with WNV has been studied, with no clear evidence of an association with microcephaly. there are an estimated 390 million DENV infections occurring annually. the outcomes of these pregnancies have been variable, including early pregnancy loss, elective termination, delivery of an infant with severe microcephaly, and seemingly unaffected infants. many unanswered questions remain concerning in utero transmission of ZIKV infection and the development of microcephaly. cases of a diffuse demyelinating disorder consistent with GBS have also been reported in Brazil, El Salvador, Colombia, and Venezuela (75, 92). a case-control study of the outbreak found that GBS patients were more likely to have evidence of past ZIKV infection than controls. a recent study of a fetus with microcephaly recovered after elective termination at 32 weeks of gestation also revealed numerous calcifications in the cortical and subcortical regions of the frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes of the cerebral cortex (77). the reported microcephaly cases may represent only the severe end of the spectrum, such that newborns with less-severe infection could still have long-term cognitive or functional sequelae in mice, pathological manifestations of disease were restricted to CNS tissues. neuronal degeneration and cellular infiltration were observed in regions of the spinal cord and brain. evidence of neuronal injury also was observed in pathological evaluation of a human fetus infected in utero with ZIKV. a laboratory-based diagnosis of ZIKV is the gold standard (120) the most definitive current diagnostic tool is a reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assay that detects ZIKV RNA and can distinguish ZIKV infections from DENV, CHIKV, and other viral infections. 19.2% of tests were positive for ZIKV RNA in saliva but negative in blood. the use of saliva samples increased the rate of molecular detection of ZIKV. the use of saliva samples increased the rate of molecular detection of ZIKV. valescent-phase sera and a greater than 4-fold rise in ZIKV antibody titers specifically may increase the accuracy of serological testing. ideally, a serological assay that minimizes cross-reactivity of other flaviviruses is needed to increase the specificity of serological tests substantially. the association between ZIKV and microcephaly was unexpected, as this presentation has not been associated with flaviviruses. if ZIKV is neurotropic and neurovirulent in the developing fetus, its effects seem unlikely to manifest only as microcephaly. the association between ZIKV and microcephaly could be a consequence of its introduction into a population with unique patterns of flavivirus immunity. a growing body of evidence indicates that ZIKV can cross the placenta, infect the fetus, and damage the developing brain (74, 76\u201380, 92). demonstrating a direct causal role for congenital ZIKV infection in the development of microcephaly will require more extensive clinical and epidemiological studies. secondary DENV infections (or primary infections in infants with circulating maternal antibodies) can produce severe disease manifestations, including plasma leakage, hemorrhage, and circulatory collapse. the phenomenon appears to be biologically relevant only in the context of DENV, possibly due to the degree of antigenic relatedness between different DENV serotypes. the first live-attenuated tetravalent DENV vaccine (Dengvaxia) completed phase III human trials. no ZIKV vaccines have been tested even at the preclinical stage. a major issue remains as to whether it will be easy or difficult to generate an immunogenic and safe vaccine against ZIKV. no drug screening studies have been published with ZIKV. antiviral drug discovery screens have been performed to identify inhibitors of specific steps in the DENV life cycle. antiviral drug discovery screens have been performed to identify inhibitors of the fusogenic activity of E protein. there are few available data in nonhuman primates apart from the original isolation of ZIKV from the serum of a febrile rhesus monkey (9) and a study recently initiated to assess ZIKV infection dynamics in three rhesus macaques. only three papers have reported on ZIKV infection in mice. health, clinical, and basic science interest in ZIKV will increase our understanding of this arbovirus. emergence of ZIKV in Brazil represents another example of an arbovirus introduction into the western Hemisphere with significant impacts on human health and ecology. the abundance of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in Latin America and the Caribbean suggests that ZIKV may become endemic in the region. the lack of specific measures to prevent or treat ZIKV disease in pregnant women has prompted public health authorities to issue highly unusual recommendations regarding pregnancy. access to contraceptives, prenatal care, and safe abortion services should be components of any public health response to ZIKV. the association between ZIKV and microcephaly was unexpected, as this presentation has not been associated with flaviviruses. microcephaly may be the most apparent congenital abnormality from ZIKV infection. it remains possible that the virus can cause a spectrum of neurological effects. a growing body of evidence indicates that ZIKV can cross the placenta, infect the fetus, and damage the developing brain. a causal role for congenital ZIKV infection in the development of microcephaly will require more extensive clinical and epidemiological studies. the existing data do not demonstrate that ZIKV infection is sufficient to cause microcephaly, and other factors may potentiate the teratogenic effects of ZIKV. ADE between DENV and ZIKV and altered disease pathogenesis warrant further evaluation. the severity of disease seen in recent outbreaks of ZIKV has been greater than that seen in earlier outbreaks. this raises the possibility that ZIKV infection in individuals immune to DENV could result in more severe disease presentations. a major issue remains as to whether it will be easy or difficult to generate an immunogenic and safe vaccine against ZIKV. a fraction of candidates for ZIKV vaccines would have preexisting cross-reactive antibodies derived from natural or vaccine-induced flavivirus immunity. the development of therapeutics should be a priority. antiviral drug discovery screens have been performed to identify inhibitors of the fusogenic activity of E protein, the protease and helicase activity of NS3 and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and methyltransferase activities of NS5. additional strategies being considered include the repurposing of drug screens, including the testing of FDA-approved or well-studied \u201corphan\u201d drugs against ZIKV. a systematic analysis of ZIKV disease resulting from infection through multiple routes (e.g., intradermal, subcutaneous, and intravenous) in different strains of mice at different ages is needed. a systematic analysis of ZIKV disease resulting from infection through multiple routes (e.g., intradermal, subcutaneous, and intravenous) is needed. the presence of cultural and economic factors such as air conditioning, window screens, indoor lifestyles, and vector control measures may prevent widespread ZIKV outbreaks in the united states. the lack of specific antiviral measures to combat ZIKV emphasizes the importance of vector control strategies for combatting arbovirus disease. the absence of specific antiviral measures to combat ZIKV emphasizes the importance of vector control strategies for combatting arbovirus disease. in the united states, the CDC has recommended enhanced prenatal surveillance of pregnant women who have traveled to areas with ZIKV circulation (74, 80, 91) access to contraceptives, prenatal care, and safe abortion services should be components of any public health response to ZIKV."}
