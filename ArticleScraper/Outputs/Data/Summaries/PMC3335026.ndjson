{"summary": "the schlieren and shadowgraph techniques have been used for clinical imaging since the 1970s. the schlieren and shadowgraph technique has the advantage of not using any irritant or toxic tracers, or intense (e.g. laser) lighting. a large 1 m diameter, high precision, spherical concave mirror of 10 m radius (i.e. of focal length of 5 m, an aperture of f/5, Cosmo Optics, Inc., Middletown, NY, USA) was used to reflect light produce by a white LED light source. this height was selected as it would allow the image of the head of most people of average height to be captured in the mirror. reflected light from the mirror is refracted to different degrees as it passes through the warmer (less dense) exhaled air (around 30\u00b0C) of the human subject. smaller temperature differences than this produced images with less contrast that were difficult to analyze. black-and-white shadowgraph images were found to offer a better black-and-white contrast. each volunteer was asked to cough freely (at least two bouts) across the mirror as a control. they were then asked to cover their mouth and nose with their arm and repeat the coughing. the \u2018free\u2019 coughs were also used for the estimates of propagation distance and velocity. the maximum x distance in each frame was calculated by searching the dataset for the point which had the greatest horizontal displacement. the area of the cough plume was calculated by numerically integrating around the perimeter. the frontal horizontal velocity plot was calculated using the horizontal displacement values vs. time. ages were compiled showing each of these volunteers coughing, as well as the effects of covering the mouth and nose with an arm in order to limit the dissemination of these aerosols. a large 1 m diameter, high precision (astronomical quality), spherical concave mirror of 10 m radius (i.e. of focal length of 5 m, an aperture of f/5, Cosmo Optics, Inc., Middletown, NY, USA) was used to reflect light produce by a white reflected light from the mirror is refracted to different degrees as it passes through the warmer (less dense) exhaled air (around 30\u00b0C) of the human subject. smaller temperature differences than this produced images with less contrast that were difficult to analyze. black-and-white shadowgraph images were found to offer a better black-and-white contrast and \u2018defineable edges\u2019 for the visible airflow boundaries. each volunteer was asked to cough freely (at least two bouts) across the mirror as a control. they were then asked to cover their mouth and nose with their arm and repeat the coughing. the \u2018free\u2019 coughs were also used for the estimates of propagation distance and velocity, and maximum 2-dimensional (2-D) projected area covered over time. raw images from the Photron high-speed camera were recorded as individual TIFF files. for the video montages, these were saved using the proprietary camera/image analysis software PFV (Photron Fastcam Viewer) then converted to smaller and more manageable JPEG files. the software algorithm measured the resolved detectable distance in the \u2018x\u2019 direction (B), as this was the clinically important parameter reflecting the horizontal propagation distance of the cough. it also measured the maximum detectable 2-D projected area resolved in the horizontal direction of the cough as seen by one of the independent observers. the individual plots showed a high degree of variability between the volunteers, which was expected given the different ways each of them coughed. only the first \u2018cough\u2019 for each of these volunteers was digitized and used in this analysis. combining plots of all the coughs produced by the 20 healthy volunteers demonstrate the cough airflow dynamic parameters measured in these experiments. for most of these male and female volunteers, the changing values of these cough airflow parameters fell within the limits of the vertical y-axes shown in Figure 3. locities vary between 0\u20136 m/s, detectable 2-D projected areas vary between 0\u20130.15 m2 and derived 2-D projected area expansion rates vary between 0\u20131.5 m2/s. for cases 15 and 20, the higher exit velocities of approximately 8.8 m/s and 14 m/s may simply be representative of natural variation in this age group. re-examination of these video clips revealed that the natural head positions of these volunteers tended to angle their coughs in a downwards direction (and off the bottom edge of the mirror) re-recording the coughs with the head position of these volunteers adjusted to allow a more horizontal cough plume to be captured would have extended the distance for which these airflows would have been traceable. the highest cough propagation distance and 2-D projected area amongst the male volunteers was produced by a male volunteer who smoked six 20-cigarette packs per week. a male volunteer smoked six 20-cigarette packs per week produced may be indicative of the properties of a typically large volume \u2018smoker's cough\u2019. the results for maximum cough velocities obtained more naturally in this shadowgraph study are a useful validation of those obtained in these more artificial PIV settings. this study examined cough airflow rates (as opposed to velocities per se) in a cohort of human volunteers who were smokers. however, it is difficult to convert such airflow rates to velocities without accurate measurements of the changes in shape and size of the mouth opening during coughing. this dynamic mouth opening behavior during a cough has been documented by Gupta et al [18] and can be seen to some extent in the individual volunteers when coughing in video S1. a similar situation may apply to describing cough airflow characteristics. shadowgraph imaging used in this study, the cough was treated as purely an airflow phenomenon, with the moving, visible airflow boundaries being used to estimate the distance and area covered by the cough. it is acknowledged that for infections predominantly transmitted by large droplets over shorter distances, the shadowgraph method may not be optimum as it was designed specifically to examine airflows. this is simply due to the limitations of this technique, as it was used in these experiments. airflow boundaries are no longer visible \u2013 or the cough goes off the edge of the mirror surface depending on the angle of the cough direction produced by individual volunteers. the more erratic variation in the cough propagation distance and 2-D projected area expansion rates may be a result of multiple, overlapping wave-fronts within the \u2018coughed\u2019 air mass, pushing the visible edge of the expanding airflow boundaries at different rates over the same period. such large droplets will tend to fall out of the air-stream quite rapidly. this may not pose a significant risk for longer-distance dissemination. however, the observed behavior of the airflow in these shadowgraph images tends to support the second concept described above. volunteers were asked to cough on cue in an experimental environment. the airflow dynamics of coughs which arise naturally may exhibit different airflow dynamics. this is in contrast to the PIV studies in which the movement of the human volunteers are usually unnaturally constrained to some extent, for safety reasons. this effectiveness of this intervention is necessarily subject to the degree with which the individual has time to carefully cover the nose and mouth completely with the sleeve."}
