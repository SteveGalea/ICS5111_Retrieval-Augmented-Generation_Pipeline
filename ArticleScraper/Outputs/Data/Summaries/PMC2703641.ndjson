{"summary": "rBmNPV-hPRR bacmid-injected silkworm larvae produced recombinant baculovirus of 1.31 108 plaque forming unit (pfu) in hemolymph. rBmNPV-hPRR was produced in silkworm larvae and purified from its hemolymph using size exclusion chromatography. rBmNPV-hPRR indicates that baculovirus production using silkworm larvae and its purification from hemolymph can provide an economical approach in obtaining the purified BmNPV stocks with high titer for large-scale production of hPRR. also, it can be used for further binding analysis and screening of inhibitors of hPRR. the hemolymph of baculovirus-infected silkworm larvae is used as a high titer-baculovirus solution. the purification of baculovirus from silkworm larval hemolymph has neither been performed nor reported. the rapid method of BmNPV titer measurement was established using quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR) cross points for individual baculovirus DNA dilution measured by Q-PCR and titer determination by end-point dilution method have a precise linear correlation with baculovirus titer. titer determination was performed for 142 bp DNA fragment of BmNPV, upstream of ie-1 gene. titer was amplified at the same position as for 142 bp DNA fragment of AcMNPV. recombinant BmNPV was prepared by transfection of recombinant BmNPV bacmid DNA into Bm5 cells. after transfection, BmNPV is required to be amplified several times in order to obtain sufficient virus titer. five milliliter of transfection solution was obtained from 2.5 106 Bm5 cells. hemolymph was also prepared from 13.6 g of rBmNPV-hPRR bacmid. baculovirus number from hemolymph was 2.8 104 times higher than that obtained from transfection solution. 72 pfu/larva (30 l of rBmNPV-hPRR containing 2.38 107 pfu/ml) was enough to infect all silkworm larvae. even the 1:105-diluted hemolymph was still found to be infectious to silkworm larvae. baculovirus solution was prepared by dilution of hemolymph from rBmNPV-hPRR bacmid-injected silkworm larvae with PBS (pH 6.2) white and black bars indicate 4 and 5 days p.i., respectively. purification of rBmNPV-hPRR from larval hemolymph using size exclusion chromatography Hemolymph was harvested from rBmNPV-hPRR containing hemolymph ( the first peak was eluted between 6.5 and 8.5 ml in the void volume. maximum baculovirus titer was 4.86 107 pfu at the fraction 14. the total number of recovered rBmNPV-hPRR was 1.21 108 pfu. lane 4 purified rBmNPV-hPRR from hemolymph by superdex 200 10/300 GL and Sephacryl S-1000 SF column chromatography Volume (ml) Titer (pfu/ml) Virus/Protein (pfu/mg) Recovery (%) Purification (fold) Hemolymph 0.38E+08 1.19E+08 33.2 7.17E+06 100 1 Superdex 200 10/300 GL 2 6.
