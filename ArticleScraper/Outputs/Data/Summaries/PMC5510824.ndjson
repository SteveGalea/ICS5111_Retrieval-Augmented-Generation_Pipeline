{"summary": "multiplex PCR tests have improved our understanding of respiratory viruses\u2019 epidemiology by allowing their wide range detection. we describe here the burden of these viruses in hospital settings over a five-year period. in the diagnosis of viral respiratory tract infections were serology, virus isolation in cell culture and immunofluorescence assays. these techniques have a low sensitivity or can detect only a limited number of viruses. the use of such tests has also demonstrated that the carriage of respiratory viruses is very rare in adults (2.1%). all nasopharyngeal swabs, bronchial aspirates and bronchoalveolar lavages were placed in Virocult MWE (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) transport medium for transport to the virology laboratory of Bichat-Claude Bernard Hospital. repeated samples taken from the same part of the respiratory tract (upper or lower) of the same patient in the same month were discarded. the two types of virus were grouped together as \u201cpicornavirus\u201d for the purposes of this analysis. the tests, accounting for 26.4% of all the tests included in the analysis, cannot detect bocaviruses. the various tests used have been reported to have similar performances. all nasopharyngeal swabs, bronchial aspirates and bronchoalveolar lavages were placed in Virocult MWE transport medium for transport to the virology laboratory of Bichat-Claude Bernard Hospital. repeated samples, defined as samples taken from same part of the respiratory tract (upper or lower) of the same patient in the same month, were discarded. the sampling areas were defined as upper respiratory tract (URT) for all nasopharyngeal swabs and aspirates and lower respiratory tract (LRT) for all bronchial aspirates and bronchoalveolar lavages. patients were stratified into several age groups: 20\u201340 years, 41\u201350 years, 51\u201360 years, 61\u201370 years and >70 years. samples tested positive for a respiratory virus and there were 118 viral co-infections. the groups of viruses identified were picornavirus (n = 762, 34.3% [IC95 = 32.2\u201336.3%]), influenza (n = 592, 26.6% [IC95 = 24.8\u201328.5%]), coronavirus (n = 260, 11.7% [IC95 = 10.4\u201313.1%]), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (n = 21 61\u201370 >80 Number of samples 4621 2151 3865 2729 1944 2464 778 1586 366 584 971 1550 1745 704 Positivity rates (%) [IC95] 33.3 [32.2\u201334.3] 22.2 [20.9\u201323.5] 32.6 [31.1\u201334.1] 26.2 [24.6\u201327.9] 24.6 [22.7\u201326.6] 31.6 [29.8\u201333.5] 30.8 [27.6\u201334.2] 3 the frequency of positive tests for viruses was higher during the winter period than during the summer period. the distribution of influenza followed the typical seasonal pattern observed in Europe, with active circulation from January to March. picornavirus and parainfluenza virus circulated throughout the winter. 78.6% of all viruses detected during the summer period. picornaviruses constituted the second most frequent group of viruses during the winter (26.1%). 67 (18.8%) 27 (7.3%) 8 (2.9%) 3 (1.7%) 0 (0%) 1 (1.2%) 0 (0%) 2 (6.5%) 2 (2.4%) 8 (5.4%) 26 (16.5%) 60 (23.7%) 2 (0.7%) 15 (8.5%) 14 (16.9%) 21 (24.7%) 18 (34%) 3 (9.7%) 11 (13.1%) 21 (14.3%) 14 (8.9%) 24 (9.5%) Adenovirus 9 (2.5%) 3 (0.8%) 5 (1.8%) 5 (2.8 the URT was more frequently sampled during the winter (77.5% vs. 55.5% for the LRT, p0.0001) and the positivity rate was higher for the URT than for the LRT (32.0% [IC95 = 31.1\u201334.1] vs. 25.3% [20.9\u201323.5], p0.0001) the distribution of viral groups differed significantly between the URT and LRT. influenza and picornavirus accounted for 39.4% [IC95 = 36.0\u201342.9] and 27.4% [IC95 = 24.4\u201330.7] of all viruses. the proportion of samples obtained during the winter differed significantly between types of medical unit. infections of the LRT area are more representative of severe infections. 1% [IC95 = 15.1\u201325.9] and 40% [IC95 = 34.5\u201346.0] of the viruses identified in all age groups. influenza was the most frequent in all but the most extreme age groups considered (20\u201330 and >80 years), in which influenza was the most frequent. influenza was the most frequent in all but the most extreme age groups considered (20\u201330 and >80 years) the frequency of positive tests for viruses was higher during the winter period than during the summer period. the distribution of influenza followed the typical seasonal pattern observed in Europe, with active circulation from January to March. picornavirus and parainfluenza virus circulated throughout the year.
