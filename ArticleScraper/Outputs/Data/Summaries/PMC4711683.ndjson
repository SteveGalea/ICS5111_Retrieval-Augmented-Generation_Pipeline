{"summary": "the 1918 H1N1 Spanish flu infected approximately 5% of the world's population and killed 2%. the case fatality rates for the 1957 H2N2 Asian influenza, the 1968 H3N2 Hong Kong influenza, and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza were reported to be lower. pathology of cytokine storm Respiratory epithelial cells are also the choreographers of cytokine amplification during infection. inflammatory responses are triggered when infected cells die by apoptosis or necrosis. alveolar macrophages produce progeny viruses and release cytokines/chemokines. released chemokines attract more inflammatory cells to migrate from blood vessels into the site of inflammation. inflammatory response begins when pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) from the virus is recognized by the pattern recognition receptors of innate immune cells. IL-1 and IL-6 are the main pro-inflammatory cytokines released by hosts during viral infections. IL-1 is expressed in the early stages of infection followed by an increasing expression of IL-6.7 IL-1 receptor signaling is responsible for acute the immunopathology of tissue. IL-1 receptor/ mice were shown to have a worse outcome after H5N1 infection. pathology of severe influenza is mediated by cytokine response but not viral load. pathways associated with PRRs, ILs, IFNs, TNFs, cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase are activated to induce the transcription of NF-kB and the formation of inflammasomes. a lethal lung injury cannot be triggered in mice with defects in the epithelial early growth response-1 (Egr-1), suggesting that Egr-1 is a critical regulator of the immunopathology of CD8 T cells. severe respiratory disease of influenza is often characterized by the early secretion of Th1 and Th17 cytokines. ibrate partially protected patients with influenza-associated encephalopathy. Gemfibrozil also decreased the production of IL-1, IL-6, and IFN-, but has no effects on the mortality of H5N1-infected mice. corticosteroids are a class of steroid hormones that exhibit anti-inflammatory activity via binding to the cytoplasmic corticosteroid receptor, which regulates transcription of anti-inflammatory genes. nearly 40% of patients in France were treated for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) using adjuvant systemic corticosteroids. liferator-activated receptors (PPARs), including PPAR-, PPAR-, and PPAR-, are critical regulators of inflammation. gemfibrozil administered 48-h post-infection had no effects on the mortality of H5N1 avian influenza-infected mice. five specific S1P receptors have been found to regulate downstream signaling pathways. only S1P1 exhibits cytokine-storm-blunting activity by suppressing both innate cellular and cytokine/chemokine responses. CYM-5442 and RP-002 have been reported to protect mice from lethal infection with severe influenza. N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a modified form of the amino acid cysteine, was shown to inhibit both H5N1 replication and H5N1-induced production of pro-inflammatory molecules (e.g., IL6, CCL5, CXCL8, and CXCL10) in lung epithelial cells. intravenous immunoglobulin therapy uses concentrated globulin preparations from pooled human plasma for the treatment of acute infections. it is believed to involve multiple immunomodulatory effects by blocking Fc receptors, which are associated with tolerance to self and severity of the inflammatory state. the combination of statins and caffeine alleviated the lung injury, inhibited viral replication, and appeared to have similar efficacy as oseltamivir or ribavirin. however, an independent research study showed that statins cannot prevent patients infected with the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza from developing severe disease. some inhibitors of interferon signaling, such as suppressors of cytokine signaling, participated in a negative feedback loop in the JAK and epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase pathways. these proteins are also potential agents that protect against cytokine storm during severe influenza. herbal medicines were recommended and authorized by the Chinese government during the 2009 and 2013 H7N9 pandemics. many herbs exhibit beneficial immunomodulatory effects for the rapid recovery of viral infections and might be effective treatments for infection with severe influenza. an experimental study has shown that mice infected with H5N1 influenza have a similar mortality between the corticosteroid-treated group and the control group. a clinical trial even identified that systemic corticosteroids were responsible for an increased long-term mortality. the use of corticosteroids for severe influenza is controversial and still needs further observations. the benefits of PPAR- and PPAR- agonist treatment were found to be higher than gemfibrozil. a natural PPAR- and PPAR- agonist, biochanin A, has been confirmed to have similar immunomodulatory effects as gemfibrozil. a triple combination therapy of zalamivir, celecoxib, and mesalazine significantly reduced the mortality and levels of cytokines/chemokines of infected mice. these data demonstrate that COX-2 inhibitors may provide additional benefits when combined with antivirals. anti-TNF strategies may be a reasonable way to treat severe influenza. studies have shown that treatments using TNF-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies or soluble TNF receptor fusion proteins can reduce the cytokine production and inflammatory cell infiltrates in influenza-infected lungs. statins are competitive inhibitors of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. they exert multiple immunomodulatory effects, such as (i) modulating the activation of immune effector cells via inhibition of ROS. adenosine 5\u2032-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) exerts anti-inflammatory effects after activation. the AMPK activator aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) was reported to increase survival by 40% in influenza-infected mice. combination with pioglitazone improved survival by 60%. arbidol is an antiviral that has complicated mechanisms. both membrane-fusion-inhibition and immunomodulatory activity may contribute to its effects. post-treatment with arbidol-reduced mortality, lung lesion formation, and viral-induced inflammation. avian influenza poses a major threat to public health. many severe-infected patients died from overwhelming viral pneumonia and serious complications caused by cytokine storm. immunomodulatory strategies and novel approaches have been advocated."}
