{"summary": "in acute infections with SARS-CoV, lung damage progresses to diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), resulting clinically in ARDS. ARDS is considered to be the most severe form of ALI (13, 18, 28, 49) in acute infections with SARS-CoV, lung damage rapidly progresses to diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) AT1/ mice on the 129/Sv background with a human isolate of SARS-CoV demonstrated that STAT1 (signal transducers and activators of transcription 1) was necessary to control viral replication and spread (15, 79). STAT1 is a member of the signal transducers and activators of transcription family of transcription factors. STAT1/ mice in this genetic background have an inability to clear virus by 9 days postinfection and proceed to develop a severe lung disease phenotype. this includes extensive mixed inflammatory infiltrates, predominantly neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages, as well as pathological features of DAD. the lack of STAT1 in the macrophage and monocyte lineage can shift the immune response and produce significant lung injury. inhibition of AA macrophage development in STAT1/ mice protects them from severe lung disease and prefibrotic lesions during SARS-CoV infection. cells were grown in minimal essential medium (MEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gemini Bioproducts, West Sacramento, CA) STAT1/ mice were a gift from David Levy (New York University [NYU]) the lines were screened for the presence of Cre and 2 copies of the STAT1/LoxP allele. the lines were screened by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and PCR for the presence of STAT1 in the affected tissue. peribronchiolar, and perivascular inflammation were scored from 0 to 3. for each experimental group, Goicochea blindly scored 3 mice. other histologic features, such as the presence of reactive bronchiolar epithelial and pleural changes, were also noted for each group in the text. chimeras of C57/B6 wild-type (WT) and C57/B6 STAT1/ mice were created using standard chimera techniques. we used the congenitally marked CD45.2 C57/B6 WT mice and CD45.1-marked C57/B6 STAT1/ mice to track the bone marrow reconstitution. both mice were then irradiated with 1,080 rads to achieve complete bone marrow ablation. mice were infected with 1 105 PFU SARS-CoV rMA15 or mock infected with a PBS control. all animals were harvested for pathology, immunohistochemistry, RNA, protein, and viral-titer assays. all animals were grown to 10 weeks of age prior to use in experiments. endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by incubating slides in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 30 min at room temperature. antigen retrieval was performed by incubating slides for 20 min in IHC select citrate buffer, pH 6.0. slides were washed before incubation with biotinylated secondary antibody. the slides were deparaffinized using two changes of xylenes for 5 min each change. an ethanol series was then used to rehydrate the sections. the slides were then incubated in MOM mouse IgG blocking reagent for 1 h at RT. peritoneal macrophages were obtained by injecting mice with 3 ml of sterile 3% thioglycolate broth (Remel, Lenexa, KS) intraperitoneally. cells were harvested by lavage of the intraperitoneal cavity. cells were washed in DMEM and pelleted for further analysis by reverse transcription-PCR. cells were grown in minimal essential medium (MEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gemini Bioproducts, West Sacramento, CA) STAT1/ mice were a gift from David Levy (New York University [NYU]) the lines were screened by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and PCR for the presence of STAT1 in the affected tissue. STAT6/ mice were crossed with STAT1/ mice, and F1 pups were generated. selected pups were bred for use in infection experiments. scores were tabulated to compare strains, time points, and infections. other histologic features, such as the presence of reactive bronchiolar epithelial and pleural changes and the extent of peribronchovascular neutrophilia, were also noted. both STAT1/ CD45.1 and WT CD45.2 mice were irradiated with 1,080 rads to achieve complete bone marrow ablation. mice were then given enrofloxacin (Baytril) in their drinking water to ward off infection and allowed to recover and reconstitute for 6 weeks. all animals were grown to 10 weeks of age prior to use in experiments. mice were inoculated intranasally with 50 l of either PBS or 1 105 PFU of rMA15. mice were euthanized at days 2, 5, or 9 postinfection. slides were incubated in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 30 min at room temperature. slides were dehydrated using 2-min incubations in xylenes. slides were dehydrated using 2-min incubations in xylenes. slides were incubated in MOM mouse IgG blocking reagent for 1 h at RT. anti-STAT1 primary antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories, San Jose, CA) was diluted at 1:100 in MOM protein diluent. slides were incubated in primary antibody for 30 min at room temperature. rMA15 is a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV containing 6 amino acid mutations from the WT Urbani strain of SARS-CoV that produces lethal disease in both C57BL/6 and STAT1/ mice. the mice were weighed daily over a 9-day course of infection. a new tab C57BL/6 STAT1/ mice are highly susceptible to rMA15. weight loss in WT and STAT1/ mice infected with either rMA15 or PBS control. STAT1/ mice infected with rMA15 showed bronchiolar sloughing at 2 days p.i., with significant cell debris in the bronchioles. at 2 days p.i., STAT1/ mice showed a more severe lung pathology that persisted throughout the course of infection. at 9 days p.i., STAT1/ mice had statistically significant inflammation throughout the lung tissue. this lung pathology suggests an inappropriate immune response continuing even after virus had been cleared to below detectable levels. YM1 and FIZZ1 are both expressed from AA macrophages in the lung during diseases such as allergic airway inflammation models and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. wild-type and STAT1/ mice were found to express FIZZ1 specifically along the lung epithelia in PBS-inoculated controls. of YM1 was identified at days 2 and 5 postinfection of WT or STAT1/ mice. this increase in both YM1 and FIZZ1 levels in the lung suggests an increase in AA macrophages in the SARS-CoV-infected STAT1/ mice. RNA from lungs of mice mock infected with rMA15 was isolated and used for real-time PCR analysis of IL-4 and IL-13. IL-4 and IL-13 mRNAs were reduced by 9 days p.i. in STAT1/ mice. the increase at 5 days p.i. correlates with induction of AA macrophages. STAT1 is necessary in the hematopoietic lineage to protect from rMA15 pathogenesis. our data suggest that STAT1/ mice have a dysregulated response to SARS-CoV infection. this leads to a more severe disease phenotype and delayed clearance of virus. bone marrow chimera experiments between WT and STAT1/ mice were performed. the hematopoietic lineage is necessary to protect from rMA15 pathogenesis. mice receiving STAT1/ bone marrow showed less overall damage to the ciliated epithelial cells of the large airways. however, the airways were healthy and intact. we found perivascular neutrophilia, as well as lymphoplasmocytic infiltrates throughout the lung parenchyma. promoter-driven Cre recombinase crossed mice containing the same STAT1/LoxP integrant with a FoxJ1 promoter-driven Cre recombinase to delete STAT1 in ciliated epithelial cells (77). the FoxJ1/STAT1 mouse has been analyzed and displays specific expression in the ciliated cells of the respiratory epithelium, as well as the choroid plexus, ependyma, we used IHC staining for STAT1 to verify the deletion in ciliated epithelial cells. we found high levels of expression of STAT1 in WT mice. however, STAT1 expression was lacking in ciliated airway epithelial cells. the 10-week-old WT, STAT1/, LysM/STAT1 and FoxJ/STAT1 mice were inoculated with 1 105 PFU of rMA15 and were weighed daily for 9 days. STAT1/ mice lost 10% of their starting weight during the first 3 days and then lost more than 20% of their starting weight through 9 days p.i. lymphoid aggregates were found throughout the interstitial space. there was also evidence of foci of fibroblast proliferation. this is consistent with a prefibrotic-like state seen in total STAT1/ mice. immunohistochemistry was performed on lung sections from mice harvested at 9 days p.i. mouse lungs were fixed in 4% PFA and embedded in paraffin for sectioning and staining with antibodies for YM1 and FIZZ1 markers for AA macrophage presence. YM1 was found after infection; however, it was found at background levels. we created STAT1/ STAT6/ double-knockout mice that contain the STAT1 deletion but lack the ability to. WT, STAT1/, STAT6/, and STAT1/6/ mice were infected with 1 105 PFU of rMA15 and weighed daily for 9 days. weight loss for WT mice was consistent with what was observed in previous experiments. mice were harvested and analyzed for histological lesions by H&E staining. WT and STAT1/ mice displayed similar lung pathology, as found previously. but STAT1/ mice displayed severe inflammatory infiltrates around blood vessels and airways. the level of staining was similar to that observed in WT mice after infection. rMA15 is a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV containing 6 amino acid mutations from the WT Urbani strain of SARS-CoV. the mice were weighed daily over a 9-day course of infection. they lost 15% of their body weight during the first 4 days postinfection. STAT1/ mice continued to lose 20% of their starting weight by 9 days p.i. titers were below detectable levels by 9 days p.i. STAT1/ mice showed a 2-log-unit increase in titer at 5 days p.i. compared to WT mice but still cleared virus by 9 days p.i. at 2 days p.i., STAT1/ mice showed lung pathology similar to that seen in WT mice. at 5 days p.i., STAT1/ mice did not have same recovery as WT mice. yM1 and FIZZ1 are expressed from AA macrophages in the lung during diseases such as allergic airway inflammation models and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in mice, lung sections were stained with antibodies for YM1 and FIZZ1 to analyze their expression during rMA15 infection. YM1 expression in wild-type and STAT1/ mice was associated with alveolar macrophages with little to no expression in the ciliated lung epithelium of the large airways. however, at 9 days p.i., STAT1/ mice showed evidence of YM1 still associated with alveolar macrophages. this increase in both YM1 and FIZZ1 levels in the lung suggests an increase in AA macrophages in the SARS-Co RNA from lungs of WT and STAT1/ mice mock infected with rMA15 was isolated and used for real-time PCR analysis of IL-4 and IL-13 mRNAs. the increase at 5 days p.i. correlates with the induction of AA macrophages. RNA from WT and STAT1/ mice at 2, 5, and 9 days p.i. was extracted from mouse lungs. three mice were used for each time point and strain. the fold change was calculated by comparison of the total induction for each. all groups had peak viral titers at 2 days p.i., with titers beginning to diminish by 5 days p.i. by 9 days p.i., virus was below detectable levels. wild-type mice receiving STAT1/ bone marrow were indistinguishable from normal wild-type mice. in STAT1/ mice that received wild-type bone marrow, there was damage to the large airways, particularly to the ciliated epithelial cells that line the airways. cell debris was also observed in the bronchiolar airspace. inflammatory infiltrates followed a focal pattern as opposed to the diffuse inflammation seen in total STAT1/ animals. hematopoietic link and increase in AA macrophage markers led us to hypothesize that STAT1 contributes to shaping macrophage responses during SARS-CoV infection. a change in macrophage polarization was leading to severe lung disease. to test this, we developed 2 mouse strains in which STAT1 is conditionally knocked out. sM/STAT1 mice confirmed deletion of STAT1 using gene-specific primers. in macrophages, a higher-molecular-weight band is found in WT mice. in blood, where the LysM promoter is not active, we do not see a deletion in the LysM/STAT1 mice. 1 in ciliated epithelial cells stained with anti-STAT1 antibody. alveolar cells and Clara cells are positive but ciliated epithelial cells are negative for staining. at 9 days p.i., we found minimal residual inflammation in the conditional knockout mice following infection with rMA15. we observed that LysM/STAT1 mice had persistent inflammation throughout the lung, and specifically, we found cuffing of the large airways. the LysM/STAT1 lungs contained inflammatory infiltrates comprise of neutrophils, as well as macrophages. cells lead to enhanced lung injury and disease after rMA15 infection. Alternatively activated macrophages are induced in LysM/STAT1 mice. induction of AA macrophages is similar to induction in total STAT1/ mice. FIZZ1 levels were also low in uninfected LysM/STAT1 mice. however, similar to YM1, these levels were elevated at 9 days p.i. in mice lacking STAT6, no AA macrophages are found after treatment with several AA macrophage inducers. we created STAT1/ STAT6/ double-knockout mice that contain the STAT1 deletion but lack the ability to produce AA macrophages. weight loss curves of WT, STAT1/, STAT6/, and STAT1/6/ mice infected with rMA15. H&E staining of mice mock infected with PBS or infected with rMA15. sections from WT, STAT1/, STAT6/, and STAT1/6/ mice inoculated with rMA15-infected mice showed minimal YM1 and FIZZ1 expression in rMA15-infected mice. the level of staining was similar to that observed in WT mice after infection. the interaction between host and pathogen controls the outcome of an infection. from the virus side, many viral proteins directly affect host cell function during infection. from the host side, the response to infection can exacerbate disease and lead to increased damage. a novel pathway in this process is the STAT1/EGFR signaling axis. Mutations in STAT1 have been found in many cancers throughout the body. STAT1 has been shown to activate cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. rMA15 in 129/Sv STAT1/ mice showed a phenotype different from that of rMA15. 129/Sv STAT1/ mice lose around 15% of their starting weight but recover that weight over a 9-day course of infection. the mice develop acute lung injury with the development of pre-pulmonary-fibrosis-like lesions. the mice are only on the C57BL/6 background to allow the Cre/LoxP experiments to be performed. the C57BL/6 STAT1/ mice are able to clear rMA15 during the course of infection while still producing the same lung pathology. this provides us a more realistic model without the issue of continued viral replication potentially altering the results. LysM/STAT1 mice infected with rMA15 showed lung pathology, weight loss, and virus growth kinetics similar to those of total STAT1/ mice. the weight loss was not significantly different from that of total STAT1/ mice, suggesting weight loss and lung pathology may be separate responses during infection. the human AA macrophage markers of increased CD163 and decreased inducible nitric oxide synthase expression (iNOS) expression (60) crossed STAT6/ mice, known to have a blocked AA macrophage phenotype (59), with our STAT1/ mice. these mice developed disease in a manner that replicated that seen in wild-type mice and also lacked induction of AA macrophage-associated proteins YM1 and Fizz1"}
