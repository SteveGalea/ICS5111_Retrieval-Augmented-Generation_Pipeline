{"summary": "nucleic acid chips have evolved into an important tool providing complex informative data. since their first development in the late 80s, nucleic acid chips have evolved into an important tool providing complex informative data. a biochip is known as plastic, glass or silicon wafer that may rapidly detect chemical agents from biological material. bioinformatics has widened the basis for organism identification to include also nucleic acid analysis. new analytical instruments, monitoring devices and rapid test kits have been created to detect and quantify bacteria. the development of fast, reliable, and sensitive analytical methods for use in monitoring of pathogens is very important. biochips can be discerned by their evaluation method, which may be optical or electric. current optical-based techniques still require a relatively large amount of power, need a bulky chip reader (optics, lasers and cameras), and thus are less applicable to miniaturization [22,25]. the invention here is a biochip system that electronically detects biomolecules. however, it has to be mentioned that the use of an electrical signal is over 40 years old. the first experiments in this area were presented by Palecek [28]. labeling is a requirement to translate the hybridization event into a signal. in a label-free approach, the transducer converts the biological interaction into a measurable signal, proportional to the degree of hybridization that is to the amount of target molecule in the sample. label-free strategies reduce analysis times and cost and are also free from unfavorable effects from the labels. chip-based nucleic acid detection principles can still be effectively employed in many other formats than microarrays. in single detection format of biochips, the use of micro- or nanoparticles, like magnetic beads with a large surface area for biomolecule attachment, results in very sensible and practical target molecule identification [37,38]. high-density microarrays are used for analyzing thousands of nucleic acid sequences simultaneously in a relatively short time. medium- and low-density array chip demonstrate in most cases the use for clinical diagnoses and personalized medical care. microarray chips are particularly important in a typing of microorganisms, and especially in detection of pathogenic bacteria. active biochips are sensors that perform or assist signal transduction. the fluid can be transported inside the channel by applying an external force. electrokinetic or electroosmotic flow control realize the solution transport over a network of channels towards the chip surface. in the case of passive chips this is done using a specific design of the geometry of the channel network. microfluidics, i.e. a complex network of valves and tubes, permits users to move liquids on and off the chip allowing for performance of multi-step assays. micro- but also nano-miniaturization presents new challenges for nucleic acid detection. oligonucleotide probes target nucleic acid sequences that are only present solely in the organism of interest to the investigator. oligonucleotide probes are designed using a proprietary oligonucleotide design program. each probe is designed using a proprietary oligonucleotide design program. homologies may eliminate potential cross hybridizations during detection on the chip. each gene-specific probe is designed by using the oligonucleotide design programs. oligonucleotide design softwares that may help in probe selection and analysis are available. in a cell, DNA is present only in very low amounts, usually just as a single copy per cell. the detection based on mRNA may also be considered. only a handful of scientists worldwide have reported electrical detection of nucleic acids isolated from cells. biochips can be coupled to low cycle number PCR amplification. to achieve low detection limits reliably it is possible to increase the amount of target in the sample or to amplify the signal. many detection systems do both at the same time. nucleic acid chips have evolved into an important tool providing complex information. a biochip is known as plastic, glass or silicon wafer that may rapidly detect chemical agents from biological material. this type of sensors assure the high sensitivities. the development of fast, reliable, and sensitive analytical methods for use in monitoring of pathogenic microorganisms takes at least several hours, a day or even more. the culture-based tests have a relatively low sensitivity, about 3050%. the probability of identifying a particular bacterium from the sepsis patient is less than 50%. biochips can be discerned by their evaluation method, which may be optical or electric. most biochips available on the market are based on external or internal optical detection (fluorescence or chemiluminescence) the invention here is a biochip system that electronically detects biomolecules. however, optical readers remain expensive and not portable. this limits their use as a routine tool and also for dispersed testing and typing in the field. label-dependent methods achieve the highest sensitivities, but eliminating labeling steps simplifies the readout. label-free strategies reduce analysis times and cost, and are free from unfavorable effects from the labels. a metal/oxide/semiconductor device is essentially a capacitor with variable capacitance. with such detection systems, different targets can be effectively screened for their presence by the examination of specific genomic regions. many aspects crucial to specificity or detection limit remain unsolved. large sets of nucleic acid probe sequences are immobilized in defined, addressable locations on the surface of a substrate. each spot represents the equivalent of a conventional analysis performed in a test tube. high-density microarrays are used for analyzing thousands of nucleic acid sequences simultaneously in a relatively short time. the key factor in the successful introduction of the chip-based nucleic acid detection in on-side or point-of-care use is the miniaturization and automation of the system and procedures. the key

oligonucleotide design program. each sequence of interest is chosen and suitable sequence regions are chosen from gene probe candidates. oligonucleotide design softwares are available to help in probe selection and analysis. each gene-specific probe is designed by using the oligonucleotide design programs. peptide nucleic acid (PNA) can further improve the specificity. the immobilization chemistry is stable during subsequent assay steps. the probes must be immobilized with an appropriate orientation and configuration. there should not exist steric impediments due to the dense packing of the immobilized probes. the main drawback of assays using PCR amplicons is that they are not quantitative. due to saturation of the amplification reaction, the amount of such targets provided for biochip analysis differs from the initial material level. further development of electrical methods with focus on biochip techniques that can be coupled to low cycle number PCR. a fragmentation of the nucleic acid could antagonize negative effects on the hybridization efficiency caused by steric hindrances. biosensors are making a great impact on development of rapid and sensitive assays for the detection of pathogenic microorganisms."}
