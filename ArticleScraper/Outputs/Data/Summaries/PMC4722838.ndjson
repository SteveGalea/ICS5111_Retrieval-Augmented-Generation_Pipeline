{"summary": "studies of school-aged children who provided routine specimens during high-prevalence months demonstrate that VRIs are nearly ubiquitous in children regardless of asthma (6, 7). viral infections appear to contribute to most exacerbations of asthma but by themselves usually are not sufficient to cause asthma exacerbations. risk factors for exacerbations include those related to the individual, environment and infectious agent. children who had RV infection detected in combination with either sensitization to common aeroallergens or eosinophilia had the strongest odds of wheezing (11) these same relationships hold true for children in Costa Rica. notably, allergic sensitization increases the risk of wheezing with respiratory viruses even in the preschool years. the first C species virus was reported in 2006 after detection by molecular techniques. the long delay in the detection of the C types was due to the inability to culture these viruses. RV-C viruses can be grown in organ culture of sinus mucosa (22). RV-C types grow equally well at 33, 35, and 37\u00b0C (23) growth at warmer temperatures may contribute to association between RV-C infection and lower respiratory illness. in vitro studies demonstrated that RV-B replicates more slowly and is associated with reduced cytopathic effects and induction of cytokine secretion. RV infection induces epithelial cells to secrete chemokines that promote the recruitment of inflammatory cells. epithelial chemokine secretion is potentiated by interferons originating in mononuclear cells (45), and low-density lipoprotein can stimulate chemokine secretion by epithelial cells (47). RV Species and Virulence RVs include three species of the Enterovirus genus. the A and B species were first recognized in the 1950s. the first C species virus was reported in 2006 after detection by molecular techniques. the long delay in the detection of the C types was due to the inability to culture these viruses. RV-C and RV-A viruses are more likely to cause asthma exacerbations than RV-B. growth at warmer temperatures may contribute to the association between RV-C infection and lower respiratory illness. in vitro studies showed that RV-B replicates more slowly and is associated with reduced cytopathic effects and induction of cytokine secretion. RV induces acute-phase cytokines (e.g., IL-1 and type I interferons) and mediators (prostaglandins, kinins) that can cause malaise and myalgia (41, 42). RV activates neural pathways that promote sneezing and cough through mechanisms that are likely to involve cellular inflammation. interferons are one of the cornerstones of early innate antiviral defense to respiratory viruses. there is evidence that virus-induced interferon responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (54, 55), airway mononuclear cells (57), and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (57) are reduced in asthma. kinetics of the virus-induced interferon response are likely to be important. too little interferon during early stages of infection could lead to unrestrained viral replication. excessive interferon secretion during peak illness could add to symptoms. the net result in asthma could be increased viral replication. cross-linking of receptors by allergen can inhibit interferon secretion. the net result in asthma could be increased viral replication. differences in the lower airway environment may account for increased illness severity in asthma. physiologic changes associated with allergic airway inflammation could contribute to increased severity of RV illnesses. studies suggest respiratory allergies somehow inhibit antiviral responses. deficient epithelial interferon responses may be property of more severe asthma (60), because interferon responses of subjects with mild asthma appear to be normal (49, 61) there is also evidence that deficient antiviral responses in asthma could be restricted to the lung (55), which suggests that type 2 inflammation could inhibit virus-induced interferon responses. IgE-mediated allergic inflammation could inhibit antiviral responses in pDCs patrolling the airway epithelium. pDC interferon secretion during viral infections can inhibit Th2 responses (72) and thus has both antiviral and immunomodulating functions. FOXA3 expression in epithelial cells can also inhibit type I interferons and other antiviral responses. chronic expression in the context of allergic inflammation could instead inhibit antiviral responses, potentially leading to more severe illness. differences in the lower airway environment may account for increased illness severity in asthma. apical cells of well-differentiated epithelial cells are either damaged or stripped away. reduced barrier function in asthma could lead to more severe RV infections. exacerbations are multifactorial, and the combination of viral infection and allergy are the two most common contributors. IFN- was well tolerated and induced markers of antiviral defenses in the blood and sputum. in study subjects with more severe asthma, IFN- reduced the probability that colds would lead to exacerbations."}
