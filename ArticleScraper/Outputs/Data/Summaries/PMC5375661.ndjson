{"summary": "type I interferon (IFN) plays a critical role in initiating host antiviral responses. the host immune system is triggered by the recognition of virus-specific components (pattern recognition receptors [PRRs]) the toll-like receptors (TLRs) and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors are the most common host PRRs that respond to RNA viruses. the influenza A virus NS1 protein, Ebola virus VP35 protein, and vaccine virus E3L protein bind viral dsRNA to evade host immune recognition (8). Virus-encoded proteins also target IFN genes and IFN-induced genes to prevent host antiviral effector responses (2, 9). lysates from 293T cells that exogenously expressed the Flag-N protein or Flag-vector control were immunoprecipitated with an anti-Flag antibody. the immunoprecipitates were subjected to trypsin digestion and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) heLa cells expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-N or GFP alone were subjected to a duolink-based proximity ligation assay (PLA) followed by confocal microscopy. PLA-positive signals indicated that colocalization of the SARS-CoV N protein (but not GFP) was exclusively in the cytoplasm. this distribution was similar to that observed for the SARS-CoV N protein in human cells. a situ PLA assay was conducted as described and imaged with a confocal microscope at 100 magnification. the interaction domain of the SARS-CoV N protein and TRIM25 interacts with the TRIM25 SPRY domain. a flag-tagged SPRY domain with deleted TRIM25 failed to interact with the N protein. anti-Flag immunoprecipitates prepared from 293T cells were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Flag and anti-GFP. the SARS-CoV N protein interferes with the TRIM25\u2013RIG-I interaction. the TRIM25 SPRY and RING domains have been reported to be involved in the interaction with the RIG-I N-terminal CARDs and E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. anti-Flag immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Flag or anti-GFP. 293T cells were transfected with Flag-TRIM25, Myc-RIG-I and the indicated amount of GFP-N. phosphorylation of IRF3(Ser 396) plays an essential role in IRF-3 activation responses to virus infection. suppression of RIG-I ubiquitination by the SARS-CoV N protein could be partially rescued by TRIM25 overexpression. luciferase reporter under control of the IFN- promoter to quantify IFN- promoter activation. in concert with the inhibition of RIG-I ubiquitination by the N protein, IFN- promoter activation induced by RIG-I CARD domain overexpression was significantly inhibited by SARS-CoV N expression in a dose-dependent manner. 293T cells were cotransfected with the IFN--Luc firefly luciferase reporter plasmid, the Renilla luciferase control reporter plasmid pRL and the indicated plasmids for 36 h. the transfected cells were infected with or without SeV at an MOI of 2 for 12 h (C and F) the luciferase activity of the cell lysates was analyzed with the A549 cells were transfected with 0.5 g of Myc-vector or Myc-N for 24 h. the cells were infected with SeV at an MOI of 2 for 16 h. after 24 h, the GFP fluorescence of the vero E6 cells was detected by flow cytometry. a significantly decreased NDV-GFP infection rate was observed in vero E6 cells preincubated with the normal A549 cell culture supernatant without SeV infection. this difference was due to the antiviral activity of the IFN- released by the seV-infected A549 cells. this difference was due to the antiviral activity of the IFN- released by the seV-infected A549 cells. TRIM25-targeting siRNA resulted in a significantly higher SARS-CoV release in A549 cells. TRIM25 overexpression reduced SARS-CoV release in a549 cells. a higher TRIM25 ratio should contribute more suppression. compared with the N terminus of the N protein, the full-length N protein showed little effect on viral replication in the presence of the IFN--specific neutralization antibody. a much higher viral titer was observed in the cells overexpressing full-length N protein in the absence of IFN- antibody. unexpectedly, a lower viral titer was observed in the cells expressing the C-terminal N protein, suggesting that the overexpressed N protein promoted viral replication by suppressing IFN the virus particles released into the cell culture supernatants were quantified by viral genomic RNA level as assayed by qPCR. the results are expressed as the means SD from three independent experiments (ns, nonsignificant; *, P 0.05; **, P 0.01; **, P 0.001) the significance of results for cells not treated with the antibody from panel D was analyzed using the t test. the C-terminal part of the MERS-CoV N protein interacted with TRIM25. both the N- and C-terminal portions suppressed RIG-I-induced IFN production. the MERS-CoV N protein interacts with TRIM25 and inhibits interferon signaling. lysates from 293T cells exogenously expressed the Flag-N protein or Flag-vector control were immunoprecipitated with an anti-Flag antibody. the immunoprecipitates were subjected to trypsin digestion and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. two TRIM25 peptides in the indicated band were identified by a Mascot search. in situ proximity ligation assay (PLA) followed by confocal microscopy. PLA-positive signals indicated colocalization of the SARS-CoV N protein (but not GFP) and endogenous TRIM25 was exclusively in the cytoplasm. this distribution was similar to that observed for the SARS-CoV N protein. the C terminus of the SARS-CoV N protein interacts with the TRIM25 SPRY domain. truncated fragments of the SARS-CoV N protein were cotransfected with flag-TRIM25 into 293T cells. a flag-tagged SPRY domain with deleted TRIM25 failed to interact with the N protein. anti-Flag immunoprecipitates prepared from 293T cells were analyzed. the TRIM25 SPRY domain interferes with the TRIM25\u2013RIG-I interaction. the TRIM25 SPRY domains have been reported to be involved in the interaction with the RIG-I N-terminal CARDs and E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. 293T cells were transfected with Flag-TRIM25, Myc-RIG-I, and the indicated amount of GFP-N. the results were imaged with a confocal microscope at magnification of 100. phosphorylation of IRF3(Ser 396) plays an essential role in IRF-3 activation responses to virus infection. suppression of RIG-I ubiquitination by the SARS-CoV N protein could be partially rescued by TRIM25 overexpression. IFN- promoter activation induced by RIG-I ubiquitination was significantly inhibited by the N protein. coexpression of TRIM25 with SARS-CoV N counteracted the inhibition caused by the N protein. both the IFN- transcription and expression levels could be suppressed by the N protein and rescued by TRIM25 overexpression. the transfected cells were infected with or without SeV at an MOI of 2 for 12 h (C and F) the luciferase activity of the cell lysates was analyzed with the dual luciferase reporter assay system. the mRNA was extracted, and the IFN- mRNA expression level was determined by RT-PCR (D).

Vero E6 cells preincubated with the normal A549 cell culture supernatant without SeV infection showed a significantly decreased NDV-GFP infection rate compared with vero E6 cells preincubated with the normal A549 cell culture supernatant without SeV infection. this difference was due to the antiviral activity of the IFN- released by the seV-infected cells. the TRIM25-targeting siRNA resulted in a significantly higher SARS-CoV release in A549 cells. TRIM25 overexpression reduced SARS-CoV release in a549 cells. a higher TRIM25 ratio should contribute more suppression. compared with the N terminus of the N protein, the full-length N protein showed little effect on viral replication in the presence of the IFN--specific neutralization antibody. a much higher viral titer was observed in the cells overexpressing full-length N protein in the absence of IFN- antibody. unexpectedly, a lower viral titer was observed in the cells expressing the C-terminal N protein. cells were transfected with full-length N protein or N(1\u2013361). the cells were infected with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV at an MOI of 0.05 PFU per cell in the presence or absence of IFN--specific neutralizing antibody. both the N- and C-terminal portions of the MERS-CoV N protein suppressed RIG-I-induced IFN production. the MERS-CoV N protein interacts with TRIM25 and inhibits RIG-I interferon signaling. the luciferase activity of the cell lysates was analyzed with the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) sARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have similar genome structures, viral growth kinetics, and clinical presentations. understanding the virulence mechanisms and microbe-host interactions of these pathogens will be beneficial for the development of effective therapies to control outbreaks of similar coronaviruses. the nucleocapsid protein of MHV shares 34% homology with that of SARS-CoV. it is also regarded as a type I IFN antagonist by interfering with RNase L activity associated with the induction of 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase (2\u2032,5\u2032-OAS (41). TRIM25-mediated RIG-I activation by ubiquitination suggests that the N protein of MERS may be involved abolition of inhibition should be observed after infection with a recombinant virus bearing a point mutant of the N protein that does not bind TRIM25. abolition of inhibition should be observed after infection with a recombinant virus bearing a point mutant of the N protein that does not bind TRIM25. type I interferon treatment also improves the outcome of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection in nonhuman primate models. the results help us understand the pathogenicity of highly dangerous coronaviruses. virus with the green fluorescent protein gene incorporated into the genome were amplified in 9- to 11-day embryonated specific-pathogen-free eggs. the 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) in vero cells was determined as previously described (56, 57).
