{"summary": "sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) (1) latency-associated nuclear antigen 1 (LANA1) is the primary viral genome maintenance protein (2, 3) it targets multiple cellular tumor suppressor genes, such as p53 and retinoblastoma (Rb) (4\u20136) and ribosomal subunit, chromatin remodeling. KSHV LANA1 possesses N-terminal (N-term), C-terminal (C-term), and central repeat (CR1, CR2, and CR3) domains. CR2-3 (ABI, LNA1) recognizes repetitive EQEQ and EQEQE epitope found in CR2 and CR3 domains. full-length LANA1 (LANA1L) and a control vector were overexpressed in HEK293 cells. the proteins were pulled down by CR2 antibody and analyzed by immunoblotting. nuclear localization signals (NLS) are encoded in both N-terminal (24 to 30 aa) and C-terminal regions (27, 29\u201331) the N-terminal NLS motif appears to be part of a bipartite NLS that can bind to multiple import receptors. inefficient recognition of an AUG or recognition of non-AUG initiator codons (CUG, GUG, UUG, ACG, AUU, and AUA) results in continued scanning of a portion of the 43S preinitiation complexes. evidence is increasing that noncanonical translation initiation is more common in biological systems than previously thought. translation of viral mRNAs, including the P gene of hepatitis B virus and the small Rep40-like protein encoded by adeno-associated virus type 5 has also been reported. the highest-molecular-weight shoulder forms are generated by non-AUG-dTIS within the N terminus. most of the lower-molecular-weight forms are initiated from TIS within the central repeat domain. mouse monoclonal antibodies anti-LANA1 (CMA-810, CR2, EPQQ, 1:1,000) and anti-LANA1 N-terminal (N-term, CDLGDDLHLQPKRRKHVAD, 1:2,000) rats anti-LNA1 antibody (CR2-3) was purchased from Advanced Biotechnologies, Inc. the 30.STOP and 159.STOP constructs have a STOP codon at amino acid positions 30 and 159. the four in-frame methionines at amino acid positions 1, 6, 161 and 282 in the N-terminal domain were substituted with alanines by overlapping PCR using the indicated primer pairs. plasmid DNAs were linearized with HindIII, blunted with mung bean exonuclease. released fragments were subcloned into parent vector pcDNA6.V5.HisB via EcoRI and EcoRV restriction sites. all constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. plasmid DNAs were prepared by using the Qiagen midi-prep procedure. cells were harvested at 48 h posttransfection, rinsed once in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 1% NP membranes were lysed in 500 l of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 150 mM NaCl 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM NaF, 1 mM NaVO3, protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche]) and precleared with 40% A/G Plus-agarose beads (Santa Cruz) with rotation for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. immunoprecipitated proteins were released from beads by boiling in 30 l of 2 Laemmli buffer. samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted. the cells were harvested and washed in PBS and lysed in 250 l of lysis buffer (10 mM HEPES [pH 7.9], 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride [PMSF], 1 mM NaVO4, and 10 g of apro U2OS cells were seeded at a confluence of 105 cells per well in a 24-well plate containing coverslips. they were transfected with 0.1 to 0.3 g of expression plasmids encoding LANA1 variants using X-tremeGENE HP transfection reagent (Roche) after 24 to 48 h, the cells were rinsed briefly with PBS and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature unattached cells were rinsed and incubated with mouse CR2 (1:1,000) staining for 1 h at room temperature, followed by secondary antibody (anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488; Invitrogen) the cells were rinsed and incubated with DRAQ5 for 15 min at room temperature, rinsed in PBS, and mounted with gelvatol mounting medium for fluorescence. Rabbit monoclonal antibody for the ORF50 gene product was provided by David Lukac (ORF50, 1:3,000) mouse V5 antibody (Invitrogen) and mouse Flag-M2 antibody (Sigma) were used for C-terminally and N-terminally tagged LANA1 detection. 282 comprises the amino acid sequence between aa 282 and 1162. the four in-frame methionines at amino acid positions 1, 6, 161 and 282 in the N-terminal domain were substituted with alanines by overlapping PCR using the indicated primer pairs. the fragments were subcloned into parent vector pcDNA6.V5.HisB via EcoRI and EcoRV restriction sites. all constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. plasmid DNAs were prepared by using the Qiagen midi-prep procedure. cells were harvested at 48 h posttransfection, rinsed once in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 1% NP membranes were lysed in 500 l of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 150 mM NaCl 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM NaF, 1 mM NaVO3, protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche]) cells were precleared with 40 l of 50% A/G Plus-agarose beads (Santa Cruz) with rotation for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. immunoprecipitated proteins were released from beads by boiling in 30 l of 2 Laemmli buffer. cells were either treated with proteasome inhibitor MG132 (20 M, 12 h) or with dimethyl sulfoxide. 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride [PMSF], 1 mM NaVO4, and 10 g of aprotinin and leupeptin/ml. the supernatant was removed (cytoplasmic fraction), and the pellet was resuspended cells were transfected with 0.1 to 0.3 g of expression plasmids encoding LANA1 variants using X-tremeGENE HP transfection reagent (Roche) after 24 to 48 h, the cells were rinsed briefly with PBS and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. after blocking (10% normal goat serum in PBS) for 1 h, the cells were incubated for 1 to 2 h in a stained cells were rinsed and incubated with mouse CR2 (1:1,000) staining for 1 h at room temperature, followed by secondary antibody (anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488; Invitrogen) the cells were rinsed and subsequently stained with DRAQ5 for 15 min at room temperature, rinsed in PBS, and mounted with Gelvatol mounting medium for fluorescence. PEL lysates showed a typical pattern of 230-kDa LANA1 doublets. LANA1 shoulder bands (LANA1S) that migrate at 150 to 180 kDa (SDS\u20138% PAGE), however, are only detected by immunostaining with CR2. the N-term antibody, however, only detects full-length LANA1L bands, suggesting that LANA1S lacks N terminus peptide sequences. translation initiation sites for LANA1S occur at non-AUG codons in the N terminus and CR1 regions. deletion mutants starting at aa 161 (161) and aa 282 (282), stop codon insertions at aa 30 (30.STOP) and aa 159 (159.STOP) and methionine-to-alanine substitution mutants M1A and M6A preserve all forms of LANA1. the 161 and 159.STOP banding patterns lose S1, compared to M1A6A and 30.STOP. 282 lacks L1, L2, S1 and S2 but still preserves the low-molecular-weight shoulder bands (S3 to S8) LANA1.FL.V5 retain LANA1S bands detectable with V5 antibody. expression of LANA1S during MG132, lambda phosphatase, and TPA treatment. expression of LANA1S during MG132, lambda phosphatase, and TPA treatment. HEK293 cells were either treated with empty vector or LANA1-d1EGFP fusion construct. equal amounts of cell lysate were run on gradient gel and analyzed by immunoblotting with CR2 and -tubulin. expressing LANA1.FL were immunoblotted with lambda phosphatase treatment. phosphatase treatment reduced or eliminated Rb phosphorylation. but not markedly affect LANA1S banding patterns. M1A6A, M161A, and M282A methionine-to-alanine substitution mutations at amino acid positions 1, 6, 160, and 282. mutants were expressed in HEK293 cells and analyzed by Western blotting. the full-length LANA1 isoforms are numbered L1 and L2 and the shoulder bands are numbered S1 through S8. the prominent doublet (Fig. 3B, M1A6A, black arrows) may reflect a newly predominant isoform initiating at downstream methionines such as M161 or M282. the stop codon insertion mutant 30.STOP generates S1 to S8 but not L1 and L2. c-terminal V5 tagged central repeat (CR) deletion mutants of LANA1 (19) are unchanged in the substitution and deletion mutant proteins. the CR1 deletion reduced or eliminated the predominant LANA1S S3-S8 shoulder bands compared to full-length LANA1 (Fig. 4B). lysates were 2-fold overloaded compared to other LANA1 constructs. the gel was electrophoresed for a shorter time period to visualize CR2-LANA1S. bands of the correct predicted size for CR2 LANA1S were detected. low-abundance isoforms with 100-kDa bands containing the C-terminal V5 tag are marked with gray lines and asterisks. no shift in these bands was present with CR1 deletion, suggesting that additional low-molecular-weight, low-abundance translation products may initiate from a site downstream of CR1. th cells were seeded on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips. after fixation and permeabilization, th cells were costained with N-term and CR2-3 antibodies. nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue) the 159.STOP construct is predicted to generate an artificial N-terminal peptide (1 to 159 aa) retaining the N-terminal NLS and N-term epitope. CR2-3 staining is cytoplasmic (Fig. 6A, 159.STOP). cells were stained with mouse CR2 and with either a mitochondrial marker (MitoTracker) or a ribosomal marker (RP S6, rabbit ribosomal protein S6). DRAQ5 (blue) was used for the nuclear staining. the lower-apparent-molecular-mass LANA1S isoforms of BC1, at ca. 130 to 150 kDa (LANA1 S3 to S8) are present in cytoplasmic fractions immunostained with CR2 and CR2-3. nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were run on an SDS\u20138% polyacrylamide gel. rat monoclonal antibody recognizing the EQEQE in the CR3 domain (ABI, rat LNA1) was immunoprecipitated with CR2 antibody. the same antibody reacts to the repetitive CR2 EPQQ epitope present in CR2 domain. CR2 immunoblotting are identical for the different cell lines except that the pattern proportionally shifts between cell lines. the N-term antibody, however, only detects full-length LANA1L bands, suggesting that LANA1S comprises ca. 50 to 60% of the total naturally expressed LANA1 in PEL cells. despite differences in absolute expression abundance, most LANA1S isoforms that are expressed by LANA1.FL are also expressed by 282 LANA1. methionine-to-alanine substitution mutants M1A and M6A preserve all forms of LANA1. aa 282 lacks L1, L2, S1, and S2 but still preserves the low-molecular-weight shoulder bands. substitution mutants M161A and M282A do not alter the shoulder bands. however, migration speed is increased for all isoforms. CR2 and CR2-3 antibodies detect both LANA1L and LANA1S. MG132 treatment of a destabilized enhanced green fluorescent LANA1 protein (LANA1.d1EGFP) (50) expressed in HEK293 cells led to equal accumulation of all forms of LANA1. no low-molecular-weight bands consistent with an N-terminal proteolytic cleavage product were detected with N-term antibody by immunoblotting. lambda phosphatase treatment of LANA1 was used to measure shifts in electrophoretic migration for LANA1L and LANA1S caused by posttranslational phosphorylation. phosphatase treatment reduced or eliminated Rb phosphorylation. the lowest-molecular-weight LANA1S S7 and S8 levels are slightly increased. the lowest-molecular-weight LANA1S isoforms are constitutively expressed. the full-length LANA1 isoforms are numbered L1 and L2 and the shoulder bands are numbered S1 through S8. both M1 and M6 conform the Kozak context and have either 3A/G or +4G, or both. deletion of 1 to 161 aa (161) and the 159.STOP insertion mutant have similar banding patterns. but most of the low-molecular-weight shoulder bands remain detectable. initiation for S1 occurs between aa 30 and 159. central repeat domain 1 deletion eliminates most LANA low-molecular-weight shoulder bands. the CR1 deletion reduced or eliminated the predominant LANA1S S3-S8 shoulder bands compared to full-length LANA1 (Fig. 4B). deletion eliminates low-molecular-weight LANA1S. the observed molecular weights and theoretical molecular weights are expressed in thousands. different deletion mutants\u2014CR1, CR2 and CR3\u2014were fused to a C-terminal V5 tag. ecular-weight, low-abundance translation products may initiate from a site downstream of CR1. we cannot exclude that these low-abundance isoforms also contribute to the bands we identified as CR2 LANA1S isoforms. LANA1 isoforms lacking the N-terminal NLS localize to cytoplasm. the 159.STOP construct is predicted to generate an artificial N-terminal peptide. CR2-3 staining is cytoplasmic. 159STOP generates a N-term antibody-positive peptide fragment that localizes to the nucleus and a CR2-3 antibody-positive cytoplasmic protein. full-length LANA1 (LANA1.FL) or 161 was transfected in U2OS cells. BJAB, BC1, BCBL1, and HEK293 cells expressing various LANA1 constructs were separated into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions and immunoblotted with CR2 and N-Term antibodies. a portion of full-length LANA1L in the cytoplasm is expressed in the cytoplasm fraction and, to a lesser extent, in the nuclear compartment. nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were run on an SDS\u20138% polyacrylamide gel and immunoblotted with CR2 and N-term antibodies. LANA1 isoforms are numbered from L1 to S8. orc2 and Lamp1 served as nuclear and cytoplasmic fraction markers. endogenous and ectopically expressed LANA1 shoulder bands are N-terminally truncated isoforms present in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. this was confirmed with protein detection using both N-terminal FLAG-tagged and C-terminal V5-tagged full-length LANA1 expressed in HEK293 cells. we did not identify changes in LANA1 phosphorylation by shifts in gel mobility and phosphorylation patterns. we also did not detect any cleavage product of the N-terminal domain recognized with the N-term antibody. we also did not detect any cleavage product of the N-terminal domain recognized with the N-term antibody. the aberrant LANA1 migration (58) causes shifts in migration for alternative or deleted forms. the highly repetitive structure of the protein containing multiple CR2 and CR2-3 antibody repeat epitopes complicates the unique identification of each LANA1S isoform. this is particularly difficult in achieving clear resolution of individual high-molecular-weight bands. dTIS in human cells were found to be composed of 47% AUG and 53% non-AUG codons. the latter comprises CUG, AUG variants, and other codons as identified by GTI-seq (38). the LANA1 N terminus comprises four methionines at aa 1, 6, 161, and 282. a portion of high-molecular-weight LANA1 having an intact N-terminal epitope can also be detected in cytoplasmic fractions. the findings help explain incongruous published results, such as predicted LANA1 interactions with cytoplasmic proteins (7\u20139)."}
