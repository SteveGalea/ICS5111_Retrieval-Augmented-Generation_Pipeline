{"summary": "rVpr-induced L1-RTP depended on the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, mitogen-activated protein kinases, and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein. 6 of 15 blood samples from HIV-1 patients examined were positive for induction of L1-RTP. rVpr-induced activity was blocked by a monoclonal antibody specific for Vpr. the accessory gene of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 encodes a virion-associated nuclear protein of 15 kDa [1]. Vpr has a variety of biological functions, including cell cycle abnormalities at the G2/M phase and apoptosis of T cells and neuronal cells. a single human cell contains more than 5 105 copies of L1, 80\u2013100 of which are competent for retrotransposition (L1-RTP). approximately 100 types of inheritable diseases have been identified as sporadic cases caused by mutagenic RTP of L1 or Alu [12] rVpr induces L1-RTP when treated with rVpr. rVpr caused no apparent cytotoxicity. rVpr significantly increased the frequency of L1-RTP. the activity of 1 ng/mL rVpr was also observed in HEK293T cells. rVpr was purified by two-step column chromatography using a glutathione-bead. purified protein was stained with Coomassie brilliant blue. qPCR analysis of rVpr-induced L1-RTP used 10 ng/mL of rVpr. results of HuH-7 cells and HEK293T cells were shown. U, untreated; B, buffer; L, LPS (10 ng/mL) serum samples were treated with 500 ng 8D1 (V) or SARS-mAb (S) rVpr induces L1-RTP in vivo. qPCR analysis detected L1-RTP in the kidney after six intravenous administrations of 10 ng of rVpr. stavudine (d4T) and tenofovir inhibited the rVpr activity for L1-RTP induction. lamivudine (3TC) and azidothymidine (AZT) did not. qPCR analysis also clearly showed the inhibitory effects of 4\u2032-Ed4T. induction of L1-RTP after intraperitoneal injection of rVpr. rVpr (200 ng; three injections every 2 days) was administered intraperitoneally into two strains of hL1-Tg mice (#4). two hours before intravenous administration of 250 ng rVpr, 50 moles of 4\u2032-Ed4T was injected intraperitoneally. rVpr induces L1-RTP in renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs) hL1-Tg mice were administered once with 2 g rVpr intraperitoneally (left four panels) or 250 ng rVpr intravenously (right panels) rVpr-induced L1-RTP was blocked by 4\u2032-Ed4T. rVpr-induced L1-RTP depends on an AhR-p38-C/EBP- cellular cascade. rVpr-induced L1-RTP depends on an AhR-p38-C/EBP- cellular cascade. AhR and ARNT1 form a heterodimer (AHR complex) both AhR and ARNT1 siRNAs blocked the induction of CYP1A1 mRNA expression by 6-formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole (FICZ), a tryptophan photoproduct. plasmid DNA encoding wild-type Vpr (WT) or the LA mutant was dispensable. HEK293T cells were transfected with constructs expressing FLAG-EGFP, FLAG-Vpr-Wt or FLAG-Vpr-LAM. these data suggest that Vpr-induced L1-RTP is dependent on a molecular interaction with AhR via the LxxLL motif of Vpr. qPCR analysis revealed that the MAPK inhibitors attenuated rVpr-induced L1-RTP to the basal level observed after treatment. induced L1-RTP was investigated after the introduction of siRNAs targeting c-Jun and CREB. p38 and C/EBP- are important for understanding the cellular response to exogenously applied rVpr. rVpr-induced chromatin recruitment of ORF1 was blocked by MAPK inhibitors examined. IP using -AhR followed by WB analysis using -EGFP revealed that ORF1 and AhR were associated. cells were transfected with pORF1-TAP and then WB was performed using a peroxidase-conjugated human IgG, -H2AX and -GAPDH. similar experiments to those shown in Figure 7A were conducted. IP using -EGFP followed by WB using -ARNT1 were performed. pORF1-EGFP was detected in an extract of cells treated with -ARNT1. it was not recovered from extracts of cells treated with rVpr using -ARNT1. 1-RTP occurred in approximately 50 of 105 cells (Figure 1C, P 0.02) rVpr caused no apparent cytotoxicity. the activity of rVpr was confirmed by a PCR-based assay using pEF06R [37,38]. the PCR-based assay detects a 140 bp band that was amplified upon induction of L1-RTP (with L1-RTP), whereas it detects a 1040 bp band without L1-RTP (w/o L1-RTP). Arrows indicate primers for the PCR-based assay. SD and SA indicate splicing donor and splicing acceptor. 6 of 15 samples analyzed by a PCR assay were positive for L1-RTP induction. Interestingly, Vpr-induced L1-RTP was detected in patients with low HIV-1 titres. 8D1 significantly attenuated the L1-RTP-inducing activity in the patients\u2019 blood. rVpr induces L1-RTP in vivo. stavudine (d4T) and tenofovir inhibited the rVpr activity for rVpr-induced L1-RTP induction. lamivudine (3TC) and azidothymidine (AZT) did not. qPCR analysis also clearly showed the inhibitory effects of 4\u2032-Ed4T. hL1-Tg mice (#4) were injected six-times with buffer (lane 1) or 10 ng rVpr (lane 2). DNA extracted from each organ was subjected to the qPCR analysis. rVpr induces L1-RTP in proximal renal tubular cells (RTECs) rVpr induces L1-RTP in proximal renal tubular epithelial cells. results after six times intravenous injections of 10 ng rVpr were shown. hL1-Tg mice were intravenously injected with 250 ng rVpr six times. rVpr-induced L1-RTP depends on an AhR-p38-C/EBP- cellular cascade. earlier, we reported that various environmental compounds induced L1-RTP in a manner dependent on the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which has been shown to associate with other cellular molecules. both AhR and ARNT1 siRNAs blocked the induction of CYP1A1 mRNA expression by 6-formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole. each siRNA efficiently inhibited the functional properties of the AHR complex. rVpr-induced L1-RTP depends on AhR, but not ARNT1. HEK293T cells were transfected with constructs expressing FLAG-EGFP, FLAG-Vpr-Wt or FLAG-Vpr-LAM. qPCR analysis revealed that the MAPK inhibitors attenuated rVpr-induced L1-RTP to the basal level observed after treatment with control buffer. data indicate that the tested compounds inhibited the up-regulation of L1-RTP by rVpr. results of the qPCR assay were shown. expression of endogenous C/EBP- is reduced by siRNA application. transfection of the C/EBP- siRNA down-regulated the endogenous protein level and attenuated rVpr-induced L1-RTP. siRNAs against CREB and c-Jun did not attenuate rVpr-induced L1-RTP. one possible reason is that MAPK inhibitors are not specific for target molecules. rVpr-induced chromatin recruitment of ORF1 was blocked by MAPK inhibitors examined. we transfected a plasmid DNA encoding a chimeric protein of ORF1 and EGFP (pORF1-EGFP) into HuH-7 cells. IP using -EGFP followed by WB using -EGFP confirmed formation of this complex. HuH-7 cells were transfected with constructs expressing a chimeric protein of ORF1 and EGFP (pORF1-EGFP) or a FLAG-tagged EGFP (pFLAG-EGFP) IP-WB was then performed using -AhR followed by WB using -EGFP (lane 2). ORF1 was detected in an extract of cells treated with pORF1-EGFP. it was recovered using -ARNT1 (Figure 7D, upper panel, lane 10). rVpr-induced L1-RTP depends on an AhR-p38-C/EBP- cellular cascade. rVpr-induced L1-RTP is controlled at the post-transcriptional level. it has been proposed that L1-RTP is influenced at the transcriptional level by the methylation status of the L1-5\u2032UTR. a PCR-based assay revealed that the C12 mutant was not active for the induction of L1-RTP. the duction of L1-RTP in six patients was selectively blocked by 8D1. we previously examined blood Vpr by IP-WB analysis. we detected Vpr in 20 of 52 blood samples from patients with low viral titres. in vitro experiments support the notion that Vpr is excreted by infected cells and functions as a soluble protein with bystander effects. rVpr is active for the induction for L1-RTP in vivo Repeated intravenous administration of 10 ng of rVpr induced L1-RTP in vivo. de novo L1 insertions were detected in the vicinity of tumor suppressor genes [21,22] suggesting that L1 insertion was actively involved in carcinogenesis. this suggests that de-regulation of L1-RTP is positively linked to the development of autoimmune diseases. rVpr-induced L1-RTP depends on an AhR-p38-C/EBP- cellular cascade. no apparent changes in the CpG methylation status were observed in the 5\u2032UTR of the exogenous hL1 gene in the kidneys of hL1-Tg mice. rVpr triggered chromatin recruitment of ORF1 in an AhR-dependent manner. rVpr activates a cellular cascade for the induction of L1-RTP. 6 of 15 patients were positive for the induction of L1-RTP. rVpr is active for the induction for L1-RTP in vivo Repeated intravenous administration of 10 ng of rVpr, a dose comparable to patients\u2019 blood levels [7], induced L1-RTP in vivo. rVpr also induced L1-RTP in the kidney (Figure 4A and Additional file 6: Table S2). rVpr and Nef are candidate mediators of HIVAN. it was previously reported that forced expression of these viral genes in mouse podocytes resulted in proteinuria and glomerular diseases. it remains to be investigated whether repeated administration of rVpr causes renal insufficiency. L1-RTP is present in the mouse mammary gland, a target organ of carcinogenesis, when it was administered orally to hL1-Tg mice [29] it is plausible that humans are susceptible to the induction of L1-RTP by environmental factors. further study is required to demonstrate the activity of L1-RTP under pathological conditions. PD98059 and lipopolysaccharide (L8274) were from Sigma-Aldrich. protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics, Tokyo, Japan) were also purchased. a rabbit polyclonal antibody against human ORF1 was generated using the peptide MGKKQNRKTGNSKTQSAC. Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated goat -rabbit IgG (Invitrogen) and Alexa Fluor 488 goat -mouse IgG (Invitrogen) were used as secondary antibodies. rVpr has more potent inhibitory activity than d4T and less effect on DNA polymerases. cells were transfected with pEF06R or pL1-NeoR using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or Xfect (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan) cells were selected for 2 days with puromycin (Puro, 0.5 g/mL) for pEF06R, or with hygromycin (Hygro, 25 g/mL) for pL1-NeoR 5\u2032-GAA CGG CAT CAA GGT GAA CT-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GGG GTG TTC TGG TAG TG-3\u2032 were designed for each exon of the EGFP gene. a TaqMan-probe (5\u2032-FAM- TGC AG * C TGG CCG AC -MGB-3\u2032) was used to detect an amplicon of 87 bp in length (* denotes the exon junction) mouse -actin was 5\u2032-TGA CGT TGA CAT CCG TAA AGA CC-3\u2032. the reverse primer was 5\u2032-AAG GTA AAA CGC AGC TCA-3\u2032. cells were treated for 2 days with rVpr and further cultured in the presence of neomycin. effects of MAP kinase inhibitors on rVpr-induced L1-RTP HuH-7 cells were transfected with pEF06R and selected for 2 days with 0.5 g/mL Puro. cells were re-plated, incubated for 2 days with rVpr, and subjected to analysis. to selectively detect EGFP genes derived from L1-RTP, 250 ng of DNA were used as the qPCR template. to amplify -globin gene as an internal control, 50 ng of DNA were used as the qPCR template. L1-RTP activity of the Vpr mutant was attributable to Vpr. 100 L of serum was reacted for 60 min with 500 ng of 8D1 or SARS-S mAb at room temperature in a 300 L reaction volume. cells were transfected with plasmid constructs pFLAG-Vpr-Wt or pFLAG-Vpr-LA mutant. cells were treated with 10 ng/mL rVpr for 1 day to evaluate the dependence of the protein-protein interaction on Vpr. cells were suspended in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 1 mM EDTA samples were immersed in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) supplemented with 4% paraformaldehyde. on the following day, samples were serially immersed at 4\u00b0C in PB supplemented with 10% saccharose for 1 h, 20% saccharose until immersed completely, and then 30% saccharose overnight. on the following day, specimens were rinsed three times with TBST, and then incubated with Alexa Fluor 555-conju total cell numbers in each section were first counted automatically. the frequency of EGFP-positive cells was calculated using the numbers of total and EGFP-positive cells. three independent sections were prepared from a single specimen. the amplification conditions consisted of 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 15 sec, 50\u00b0C for 30 sec and 72\u00b0C for 30 sec. PCR products were digested using the restriction enzyme Taq I. the enzyme is specific for the methylated sequence, after sodium bisulfite treatment. a rabbit polyclonal antibody against human ORF1 was generated using the peptide MGKKQNRKTGNSKTQSAC (amino acids denoted by single letters) as an immunogen. -mouse IgG (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp., Piscataway, NJ, USA) was purchased. two hours before injection of rVpr, 50 moles of 4\u2032-Ed4T was injected intraperitoneally to give a final concentration of approximately 25 M when most of the compound is transferred to the blood. rVpr was tested for endotoxin using a highly sensitive lipopolysaccharide (LPS) assay with Limulus amebocyte lysate. cells were selected for 2 days with puromycin (Puro, 0.5 g/mL) for pEF06R, or with hygromycin (Hygro, 25 g/mL) for pL1-NeoR. cells were treated for additional 2 or 3 days with the indicated amounts of rVpr. template DNA was amplified with Eagle Taq Master Mix (Roche Diagnostics) and a CFX Connect Real-Time System (Bio-Rad) to obtain a standard curve for EGFP-qPCR, EGFP DNA generated after the induction of L1-RTP was amplified using the above primers and cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector. cells were treated for 2 days with rVpr and further cultured in the presence of neomycin (800 g/mL) each of the six plates was treated with rVpr or a buffer control for 2 days. after 3\u20134 weeks, cell aggregates were stained with methylene blue. each siRNA was introduced on day 3 after initial transfection with pL1-NeoR or pEF06R. two days later, cells were re-plated, incubated for 2 days with rVpr. on day 3 after transfection, cells were re-plated and subjected to analysis. two transgenic mouse lines were selected because they display low background L1-RTP during embryogenesis but respond vigorously to environmental compounds. all experiments were approved by the animal care and use committee at the national center for global health and medicine (NCGM) codons 64\u201368, and wild-type (WT) Vpr were expressed as FLAG-tagged proteins using the pFLAG-CMV2 expression vector (Sigma-Aldrich) codons 64\u201368, and wild-type (WT) Vpr were expressed as FLAG-tagged proteins using the pFLAG-CMV2 expression vector (Sigma-Aldrich) cells were treated with 10 ng/mL rVpr for 1 day to evaluate the dependence of the protein-protein interaction on Vpr. cells were suspended in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP40, 1 mM EDTA and a protease inhibitor cocktail. cells were completely lysed by passage through 22 and 27 G needles ten times. three slices (5 m thick) were prepared from different sections of the fixed kidney. samples were washed three times with 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (10 min per wash) sections were then reacted with rabbit -EGFP antibody (1:2000; Medical & Biological Laboratories) independent sections were prepared from a single specimen and subjected to analysis. the significance of the frequency of EGFP-positive cells was then evaluated statistically. significance was evaluated using the Mann-Whitney U-test. A P value 0.05 was deemed to indicate statistical significance. authors declare that they have no competing interest for the current work. click here for file (379.5KB, ppt) Additional file 6: Table S2 Summary of the PCR-based assay in vivo.
