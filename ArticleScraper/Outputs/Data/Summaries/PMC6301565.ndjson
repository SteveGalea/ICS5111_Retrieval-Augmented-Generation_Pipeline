{"summary": "innate immune system recognizes pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) of viral or bacterial intruders via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) this includes the family of TLRs that consists of related, transmembrane proteins that play a central role in the initiation of inflammatory responses, including the secretion of cytokines and chemokines. a growing list of viruses that induce an inflammatory response during acute infection through TLR4 activation. Known viral proteins include the RSV fusion protein (F), the EBOV glycoprotein, the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV G) and the dengue virus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1). TLR4 is stimulated by membrane-bound EBOV glycoprotein and a secreted, cleaved form (shed glycoprotein), both of which retain the hydrophobic fusion domain, but not by a different secreted version of EBOV glycoprotein. deNV NS1 lacks a fusion peptide but contains exposed hydrophobic domains that mediate membrane interaction and could play a role in TLR4 activation. IAV does not activate TLR4 by a specific viral protein, but rather induces TLR4 activation by host DAMPs. HMGB1, which is also a glycoprotein, activates TLR4 through MD-2 binding [8, 27]. the role of DAMP-mediated TLR4 activation in other viral infections remains largely unexplored. viral proteins known to activate TLR4 are membrane-bound or membrane-associated, contain hydrophobic domains, and are glycosylated. compared to well-described interaction of TLR4 complexes with relatively small bacterial LPSs, mechanism by which these complexes recognize large viral glycoproteins to trigger downstream signaling remains unexplored. a possible explanation for this observation could be that glycoprotein exposed on the surface of noninfectious EBOV particles activates TLR4. shed glycoprotein is sufficient to stimulate cytokine responses in the absence of infection [16], suggesting that noninfected TLR4-expressing cells stimulated by shed glycoprotein might contribute to the complex inflammatory response. studies with well-known TLR4 inhibitors show that dampening excessive inflammatory response mitigates disease and promotes survival. more work is needed to dissect the mechanisms by which large viral glycoproteins activate TLR4."}
