{"summary": "5% of all hospitalizations are due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections. high-risk individuals, including infants and the elderly, can be administered palivizumab. this humanized mouse antibody binds to the RSV fusion F protein, inhibits viral fusion to target cells and thus neutralizes RSV. only a limited number of adjuvants are approved for use in human vaccines due to issues such as poor tolerability, toxicity, or poor antigen compatibility. a plant-derived delta inulin polysaccharide adjuvant (AdvaxTM) provided antigen-sparing and enhanced immunogenicity for several experimental viral vaccines. line 19 respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an antigenic subgroup A strain and was propagated in semi-confluent HEp2 cells in OptiMEM media until cytopathic effect was 70-80% visible. intramuscular injection of live influenza virus was used as the vaccine antigen. hep2 cells were seeded at density of 400,000 cells per well in a 24-well plate in complete growth media to achieve even, confluent monolayers the following day. plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for an additional 15 min then inoculum was replaced with 0.8% methylcellulose overlay composed of 5% FBS DMEM, supplemented with L-glutamine, P/S and amphotericin B. a total volume of 50 l was injected into the right rear thigh using a 30-gauge needle. a total volume of 50 l was injected into the right rear thigh using a 30-gauge needle. animals were monitored for up to 4 d post-infection, followed by humane euthanasia. mice were anesthetized with 2-5% vaporized isoflourane. a total volume of 100ul was administered drop wise to the nares. heat inactivated mouse antisera was initially diluted in PBS 1:20, then serially diluted 4-fold in a 96-well plate. the virus-sera mixture was incubated for 1 h at RT with rocking. plates were incubated for 2 d at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2. plates were washed PBS with 0.05% Tween-20 (PBST) then non-specific epitopes were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBST solution for 1 h at RT. plates were washed and probed with anti-mouse IgG horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (total IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, Ig line 19 respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an antigenic subgroup A strain. it was propagated in semi-confluent HEp2 cells in OptiMEM media. pre-clarified viral supernatant was loaded onto 8.2 mL of a glycerol layer. serial dilutions from virus stocks or lung homogenates were made in FBS-free DMEM. plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for an additional 15 min then inoculum was replaced with 0.8% methylcellulose overlay composed of 5% FBS DMEM. plates were gently rinsed with phosphate buffered saline twice. uvanted-live RSV line 19 or mock-solution occurred on weeks 0, 4, and 8. three immunizations were administered to elicit maximum antibody titers. a total volume of 50 l was injected into the right rear thigh using a 30-gauge needle. 7 plaque forming units (pfu) of virus were used to intranasally infect each mouse (18-24 g in weight) the left lung was gently inflated with 10% formalin, while the right lung was diced, portioned into collection tubes, then snap-frozen on dry ice. the following approach was adapted from previously described standard RSV PRNT methodology51. plates were washed PBS with 0.05% Tween-20 (PBST) then non-specific epitopes were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBST solution overnight at 4\u00b0C on a rocker. plate washed and probed with anti-mouse IgG horseradish-peroxidase-concept. jugated secondary antibodies (total IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG3, SouthernBiotech) at dilution of 1:4000 for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. plates were washed then freshly prepared o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (OPD), followed by 1N H2SO4 stopping reagent. all endpoint dilutions titers were normalized in Mice vaccinated with RSV plus any of the three adjuvants had an anti-RSV F titer ranging from 1:181,483 to 1:275,617 following 2 vaccinations and 1:1:377,421 to 1:486,000 following 3 vaccinations. different IgG1 and IgG2a antibody profiles were observed based upon the adjuvant administered. IgG responses elicited by mock- or low-dose virus vaccine were below the background cut-off and are not shown. the minimum level of detection of viral loads in the lungs is 100 pfu/g. a ratio of IgG1 to IgG2a is provided and ratios less than 1 are indicative of enhanced Th1 responses. ratios greater than 1 are indicative of enhanced Th1 responses. subjects that have neither a Th1 or Th2 dominant profile are given values of 1. mice vaccinated with either AdvaxTM adjuvant alone or mock-vaccinated animals had no virus that was detectable in the lungs at 4 d post-RSV challenge. mice vaccinated with either Advax-1 or 2 or Imject alum control adjuvant formulations had no virus that was detectable in the lungs at 4 d post-RSV challenge. BALB/c mice were vaccinated with the RSV line 19 at 4 weeks after the final vaccination. Lungs were collected 4 d post-infection, formalin fixed, and paraffin embedded. representative images from hematoxylin-and-eosin-stained sections. Mice vaccinated with adjuvant only had undetectable (1 :200) endpoint dilution titers at all time points. mice vaccinated with RSV alone (no adjuvant) induced detectable antibody titers. these titers were 4-fold lower (1:49,355) after two vaccinations than those seen in animals vaccinated with RSV formulated with Imject alum. total mouse anti-RSV IgG responses were assayed by endpoint-dilution in ELISA assay. each sample was performed in triplicate and average endpoint dilution was calculated from average of all mice within the same treatment group. the responses elicited by mock- or low-dose virus vaccine were below the background cut-off and are not shown. pooled serum collected at week 8 from each mouse group at a dilution of 1:1000 and reported as specific O.D. P-values were calculated between the IgG1 and IgG2a titers within a single group. groups indicated with (*) have p 0.05 and ratio of IgG1:IgG2a is >1. serum was examined for neutralizing activity in a modified PRNT assay. serum samples were diluted 4-fold and performed in triplicate. mice vaccinated with either AdvaxTM adjuvant alone or mock-vaccinated animals had no virus that was detectable in the lungs at 4 d post-RSV challenge. there was a consistent trend to lower lung pathology scores in the mice that received RSV vaccine formulated with Advax-1. these lower lung scores were also observed in mice immunized with Advax-1 adjuvant alone. the presence of serum- and mucosal-neutralizing antibody titers is correlated with reduced RSV infection and disease severity. however natural infection fails to elicit long-term immunity. the elicited immune responses were compared to controls groups of mice vaccinated with vaccine only or vaccine plus aluminum salts. high Advax-2 + RSV High - High Imject Alum - RSV High - Moderate PBS - Mock - +++ Low Advax-2 + Mock - +++ Moderate Mice administered vaccine plus delta-inulin (Advax-1) had a Th2 response as indicated by the predominance of IgG1 anti-F antibody titers at week 6. the addition of CpG-oligonucleotides (CpG-ODN) to the delta-inulin adjuvant (Advax-2) during vaccination altered the IgG profile. this is indicative of a CD4+ T helper (Th) type 1 (Th1) response. mice vaccinated with Advax-1 adjuvants had a mixed Th1/Th2 phenotype. Advax-1 is a novel polysaccharide adjuvant derived from polyfructofuranosyl-D-glucose. AdvaxTM adjuvant enhances immune responses and provides antigen-sparing in vaccines against a variety of pathogens in multiple animals. the results presented in this report with an RSV vaccine and AdvaxTM formulations elicited enhanced immunogenicity over the vaccine without an adjuvant. AdvaxTM adjuvant appears to act primarily through enhancement of antigen presenting cell function with this leading to enhanced B- and T-cell activation40 and not through activation of innate inflammatory responses. the additional of CpG ODNs was more effective at reducing viral lung titers than delta-inulin only (Advax-1), which was statistically similar to mock vaccinated mice. the effectiveness of CpG ODN as an adjuvant may be due to its ability to directly activate B cells (30, 43) and macrophages71 to induce secretion of Th1 cytokines such as IFN- and IL-12. the 1960s formalin-inactivated RSV vaccine failed to mount neutralizing protection against subsequent RSV challenge. it elicited high titer neutralizing antibodies and a Th1 phenotype. there was no reduction lung immunopathology associated with RSV vaccination."}
