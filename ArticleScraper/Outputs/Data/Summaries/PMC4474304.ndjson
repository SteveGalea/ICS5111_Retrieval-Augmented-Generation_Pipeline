{"summary": "the fidelity of the viral replicase generates genetic diversity. mutations within the viral RdRp can either increase or decrease replicase fidelity. the coronavirus (CoV) replicase is more complex than that of many other RNA viruses due to their large 27-to-32-kb genomes. nsp10, a small CoV protein with no known enzymatic function, binds nsp14 and enhances ExoN activity by up to 35-fold in vitro. nsp10 is an allosteric regulator of nsp16, a 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase (2\u2032-OMT) involved in capping of coV RNA and evasion of an RNA template. targeted mutagenesis studies have implicated nsp10 as a critical regulator of coV RNA synthesis (39) and proteolytic processing by the nsp5 viral protease (40). these studies indicated that nsp10 is an essential component of the CoV replicase that directly interacts with nsp14 and affects ExoN activity in vitro. however, it is not known whether nsp10 affects the activity of nsp DBT-9 (delayed brain tumor, murine astrocytoma clone 9) cells (41) were maintained in modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen), 100 U/ml penicillin and streptomycin (Gibco), 10 mM HEPES, and 0.25 g/ml amphotericin B (Corning) a total of 1.5 g of linearized WT MHV fragments A to D and fragments F and G were ligated together with the appropriate E fragment containing the nsp10 mutation(s) overnight at 16\u00b0C using T4 ligase (New England BioLabs) a 1/10 volume of 3 M sodium acetate and 1 volume of chloroform were added to the ligation reaction. cytopathic effect (CPE) was present throughout the flask. debris was pelleted for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. the supernatant was divided into aliquots and considered passage 0 (P0) stock. RNA was harvested from DBT-9 cells infected with P0 stock. PCR was performed using a Bio-Rad C1000 Touch Thermal Cycler. step 1, 95\u00b0C for 2 min; step 2, 95\u00b0C for 30 s; step 3, 58\u00b0C for 30 s; and step 5, 72\u00b0C for 7 min. step 2 through 4 were repeated 30 times. RNA synthesis kinetics were determined at both a high MOI (1 PFU/cell) and a low MOI (0.01 PFU/cell) as described previously (26). RNA synthesis kinetics were determined by two-step real-time quantitative RT-PCR (28) using RNA harvested at the times indicated. the inoculum was removed, and fresh DMEM was added to each well. significance is denoted (*, P 0.05; **, P 0.01; **, P 0.0001) and was determined using the test described in the figure legend. the nsp16 mutant was generated similarly, except mutagenesis was performed using the F fragment. each plasmid was sequenced to ensure only the intended mutations were present. a total of 1.5 g of linearized WT MHV fragments A to D and fragments F and G was ligated together with the appropriate E fragment containing the nsp10 mutation(s) overnight at 16\u00b0C using T4 ligase. transcript for the N gene was generated using water instead of the 3 mM GTP. 50 microliters of the transcription reaction and 25 l of N transcript were electroporated into 6 107 BHK-R cells. flasks containing virus were frozen when cytopathic effect (CPE) was present. 12 overlapping 3-kb cDNA amplicons were generated using 2 l of RT product in a total reaction volume of 50 l. PCR was performed using a Bio-Rad C1000 Touch Thermal Cycler. 5-FU and RBV exhibit minimal cellular toxicity in DBT-9 cells. cells were seeded into a 96-well plate approximately 18 h prior to the addition of AZA or RBV. cells were then incubated with AZA or RBV at the indicated concentrations. the values determined for duplicate wells of each sample were averaged into one value to minimize well-to-well variation. subconfluent monolayers of DBT-9 cells in 24-well plates were pretreated with either 100 U/ml or 500 U/ml of mouse beta interferon (IFN-) nsp10 mutations allowed virus recovery; earlier attempts by another group to recover G69A were unsuccessful. we previously demonstrated that the base analog 5-FU is incorporated into the coV genome by nsp12-RdRp during viral replication, resulting in increased genomic mutations. MHV-A59 nsp10 was modeled using Phyre2 (58) a high (>90%)-confidence model was obtained using Phyre2 (58) a surface representation is shown, with mutated nsp10 residues shown in orange. the image was generated using PyMOL (59) the alanine double substitutions N40A/R80A and R80A/E82A affected virus sensitivity to 5-FU treatment. no increased sensitivity was detected during infection at an MOI of 1 PFU/cell. infection at a higher MOI could mask a subtle increase in 5-FU sensitivity due to the capacity of the population to tolerate or complement mutations. R80A/E82A-ExoN(+) shows increased sensitivity to nucleoside analogs AZA and RBV. both MHV-ExoN() and R80A/E82A-ExoN(+) showed increased sensitivity to AZA compared with WT-ExoN(+) MHV-ExoN() was undetectable by plaque assay at RBV concentrations above 20 M. R80A/E82A-ExoN(+) was more than 100-fold more sensitive to RBV treatment than WT-ExoN(+) at higher concentrations. mutations in MHV-A59 nsp10 have been reported to impact viral RNA synthesis. nsp10 mutations in MHV-A59 nsp10 have been reported to impact viral RNA synthesis. -9 cells were infected with the indicated virus at an MOI of 1 PFU/cell (A) or 0.01 PFU/cell (B), and 300 l of supernatant was collected at the indicated time points. the virus titer was determined by a plaque assay. nsp16 D130A virus titer was reduced by approximately. titers of both WT-ExoN(+) and R80A/E82A-ExoN(+) were reduced by approximately 1 log10. these results demonstrate that the R80A/E82A substitutions in nsp10 do not significantly impact 2\u2032-OMT activity as measured by sensitivity to IFN- treatment. the decreased-fidelity phenotype of R80A/E82A-ExoN(+) is dependent on the presence of intact ExoN activity. nsp10 functions to stabilize nsp14 or regulate association of nsp14 with other components of the replication complex. the titer of WT-ExoN(+) decreased by only 2-fold to 3-fold relative to treatment at 37\u00b0C. in contrast, the titer decreased by almost 100-fold in the presence of 200 M 5-FU. our data suggest that the R80A/E82A mutations in nsp10 disrupt protein-protein interactions. mutations in nsp10 coding for alanine substitutions into the infectious clone of MHV-A59 (42) at conserved amino acid positions reported to disrupt the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV nsp10-nsp14 interaction in vitro. earlier attempts by another group to recover G69A were unsuccessful. nsp10 (orange), nsp14 (blue) (ExoN domain, solid; N7-MT domain, hatched) and nsp16-2\u2032-OMT (purple). a high (>90%)-confidence model was obtained using the structure of MHV-A59 nsp10 (57) alanine double substitutions N40A/R80A and R80A/E82A affected virus sensitivity to 5-FU treatment. no increased sensitivity was detected during infection at an MOI of 1 PFU/cell. sensitivity of R80A/E82A-ExoN(+) was concentration dependent across the range tested. N40A/R80A-ExoN(+) showed a subtle increase in sensitivity only at 200 M 5-FU. mutations in nsp10 increase 5-FU sensitivity, consistent with decreased replication fidelity. MHV-ExoN() was undetectable by plaque assay at concentrations above 20 M, consistent with the strong mutator phenotype. we previously showed that MHV-ExoN(), but not WT-ExoN(+), is sensitive to treatment with RBV. the cytotoxicity of AZA during a 24-h treatment is shown and was determined using cellTiter-Glo (means SEM; n = 3) the experiment was performed as described for panel A, except with RBV. ND, not detected. levels were normalized to the endogenous GAPDH control. levels were measured in both the presence and absence of 5-FU treatment. increased 5-FU sensitivity of R80A/E82A-ExoN(+) is not due to impairment of viral RNA synthesis. alanine substitution mutation in nsp16 (nsp16 D130A) abolishes SARS-CoV 2\u2032-OMT activity and renders both MHV-A59 and SARS-CoV sensitive to exogenous IFN- treatment. titers of both WT-ExoN(+) and R80A/E82A-ExoN(+) were reduced by approximately 1 log10. sensitivity of R80A/E82A-ExoN() and MHV-ExoN() should not increase 5-FU sensitivity beyond that of MHV-ExoN(). nsp10 functions as a stimulatory factor for nsp14-ExoN (25, 32) sp10 functions to stabilize nsp14 or regulate association of nsp14 with other components of the replication complex. in the absence of 5-FU, the titers of both WT-ExoN(+) and R80A/E82A-ExoN(+) decreased by approximately 1 log10 during infection at 40\u00b0C compared to 37\u00b0C. DMEM containing 5-FU was added back, and cells were infected at either 37\u00b0C or 40\u00b0C. at 24 h postinfection, the supernatant was harvested. data are presented as means SEM. nsp10 mutants suggest single point mutations within nsp10 might not be sufficient to disrupt the nsp10-nsp14 interaction during virus replication. this is in contrast with results of studies performed using transiently transfected and recombinant nsp10 and nsp14 (25, 33), in which single point mutations were capable of disrupting nsp10-nsp14 interactions. the DNA Pol III holoenzyme contains at least 17 subunits. the catalytic site is composed of a heterotrimeric polymerase core. the subunit is a small 8-to-9-kDa protein that has no known enzymatic function. nsp10 is not a requirement for nsp14 enzymatic activity. the 100-fold increase in 5-FU sensitivity observed for R80A/E82A-ExoN(+) at 40\u00b0C indicates that fidelity is likely further decreased at elevated temperature. this interpretation is supported by the lack of temperature sensitivity of R80A/E82A-ExoN(+) compared to WT-ExoN(+) at 40\u00b0C. mechanistic understanding of CoV replication."}
