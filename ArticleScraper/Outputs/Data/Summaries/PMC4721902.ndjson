{"summary": "prospective study conducted in Nashville, Tennessee, and Salt Lake City, Utah. participants recruited convenience sample of asymptomatic children and adults. asymptomatic adults attending outpatient primary care clinics for routine health maintenance were enrolled at Vanderbilt University. pression, defined as human immunodeficiency virus infection with a CD4 cell count 200/mm3 or 14%; solid or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the past 90 days or with graft-vs-host disease or bronchiolitis obliterans. rRT-PCR was conducted on NP/OP samples using CDC protocols and primers. each virus detected in individual subjects with codetection of multiple viruses was considered positive in separate hRV and RSV prevalence calculations. if an individual had codetection of hRV and RSV, detection of each virus was considered positive in separate hRV and RSV prevalence calculations. the independent variables included viral detection, age, enrollment month/year, and enrollment city. the area under the curve for each ROC curve was calculated. sensitivity and specificity were calculated at Ct value cut points. differences were considered significant at P.05 (2 sided) patients excluded if recently hospitalized or had severe immunosuppression. patients excluded if they were recently hospitalized or had severe immunosuppression. patients excluded if they were recently hospitalized or had severe immunosuppression. CAP in the EPIC study were hospitalized with clinical evidence of acute infection, acute respiratory illness, and chest imaging showing consolidation, infiltrate, or pleural effusion. patients excluded if they were recently hospitalized or had severe immunosuppression, defined as human immunodeficiency virus infection with a CD4 cell count 200/mm3 or 14%. children were then further stratified into 3 age groups (2, 2\u20134, and 5\u201317 years old) for additional comparisons. each virus detected in individual subjects with codetection of multiple viruses was considered separately in prevalence calculations. if an individual had codetection of hRV and RSV, detection of each virus was considered positive. Ct values were used to construct nonparametric receiver operating characteristic curves to discriminate between asymptomatic controls and patients with CAP. differences were considered significant at P.05 (2 sided) logistic regression models were constructed for each virus. rRT-PCR Ct represents the first PCR cycle in which fluorescent signal for the target is greater than the minimal detection level. we compared Ct values between these groups using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. differences were considered significant at P.05 (2 sided) Clinical Characteristics of Asymptomatic Controls and Patients With CAP Characteristic Children, No. (%)a Adults, No. (%)a Asymptomatic Controls (n = 521) Patients With CAP (n = 832) Age, median (IQR), y 4 (1\u20139) 2 (1\u20136) 54 (41\u201365) 59 (50\u201373) Female sex 184 (35.3) 374 (45.0) 129 (54.2) 114 (59.4) Non-Hispanic, 127 asymptomatic children (24.4%) had 1 virus detected. most common virus was hRV, detected in 90 (17.3%) of the asymptomatic children. the number of subjects with any viral detection does not equal the sum of detections for each virus owing to codetections of multiple viruses in each subject. the number of subjects with any viral detection does not equal the sum of detections for each virus owing to codetections of multiple viruses in each subject. d aOR and AF were not calculated for the \u201cAny virus\u201d group. at least 1 virus was detected in 572 (68.8%) of the children with CAP. detection of each of the viruses was more common in asymptomatic children. the number of subjects with any viral detection does not equal the sum of detections for each virus owing to codetections of multiple viruses in the same subject. the number of subjects with any viral detection does not equal the sum of detections for each virus. hRV and hMPV strongly associated with CAP in adults. results were similar after further age stratification of children. rRT-PCR Ct values were compared between asymptomatic children and children with CAP for all viral groups except influenza. box and whisker plots of rRT-PCR cycle thresholds among children (age 18 years) positive for each virus compared asymptomatic controls and patients with community-acquired pneumonia. hMPV Ct values were significantly higher in asymptomatic children than in patients with CAP (P =.01) fourteen asymptomatic children had >1 virus, including hRV-AdV in 5 children, hRV-CoV in 3, hRV-hMPV in 2, and hMPV-PIV, hMPV-CoV, PIV-AdV, and hRV-RSV-AdV in 1 each. 80 children initially enrolled as potential controls but later excluded owing to the development of symptoms, 30 (37.5%) had a virus detected the number of subjects with any viral detection does not equal the sum of detections for each virus owing to codetections of multiple viruses in the same subject. at least 1 virus was detected in 572 (68.8%) of the children with CAP. overall detection of any virus was more common in adults with CAP than in asymptomatic adults. differences were statistically significant for 3 individual viruses: influenza, hRV, and hMPV. 127 asymptomatic children (24.4%) had 1 virus detected. most common virus was hRV, detected in 90 (17.3%) of the asymptomatic children. influenza was the only virus not detected in any asymptomatic children. the number of subjects with any viral detection does not equal the sum of detections for each virus owing to codetections of multiple viruses in the same subject. the number of subjects with any viral detection does not equal the sum of detections for each virus owing to codetections of multiple viruses in the same subject. at least 1 virus was detected in 572 (68.8%) of the children with CAP. hRV was the most common (26.6%), followed by hRV (21.9%) and hMPV (15.1%). detection of each of the viruses was more common in asymptomatic adults. the number of subjects with any viral detection does not equal the sum of detections for each virus owing to codetections of multiple viruses in each subject. aOR and AF were not calculated for the \u201cAny virus\u201d group or for viruses with no detection among asymptomatic controls. hRV was not significantly associated with CAP (AF, 0.02; CI,.18 to.34). results were similar after further age stratification of children, except AdV was significantly associated with CAP among the youngest children (2 years old). rRT-PCR Ct values were compared between asymptomatic children and children with CAP for all viral groups except influenza. none of the viruses were detected in >1% of asymptomatic adults. rRT-PCR values were significantly higher in asymptomatic children positive for RSV than in patients with CAP. the upper and lower whiskers representing 1.5 times the IQR above and below the 75% and 25% percentile respectively. hMPV Ct values were significantly higher in asymptomatic children than in patients with CAP (P =.01) the area under the ROC curve for hMPV Ct values to discriminate between case patients and controls was 0.76. rRT-PCR Ct values were higher when detected in asymptomatic controls. this suggests that most detections were associated with symptomatic illness. however, differences in prevalence and Ct values were not as marked for PIV and CoV. singleton et al [28] found 1%, 5%, and 7% of 381 asymptomatic children 3 years old to have laboratory evidence of influenza, RSV, and hMPV. compared with previous studies, some earlier pediatric studies have suggested that CoV and PIV are more strongly associated with acute respiratory illness. symptomatic adults in our study (0.8%) is consistent with prior work, including that by Lieberman et al [1], who detected hRV in 2% of 450 asymptomatic adults in Israel, and Jennings et al [39] who recently detected hRV from lower respiratory specimens in 20% of 49 intubated adults with severe CAP in Finland. a higher prevalence of asymptomatic hRV detection in children makes it more difficult to interpret a positive some studies have reported persistent viral detections weeks after acute exacerbations of certain comorbid conditions. matching controls to patients with CAP according to the presence of comorbid medical conditions and timing of related exacerbations was found to be impractical. 13% of enrolled subjects were excluded because we could not contact them to ascertain whether they developed respiratory symptoms after enrollment."}
