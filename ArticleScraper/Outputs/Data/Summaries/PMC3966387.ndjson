{"summary": "PEDV strain PC21A was detected by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) selective for the nucleocapsid gene (229\u2013557 nt) the partial nucleocapsid gene sequence of PC21A was identical to that of 2 US PEDV outbreak strains from Colorado, USA. pig 4 was exposed to the virus by indirect contact with inoculated pig 3. for each sample, the quantity of PEDV RNA GE was 106 times higher than plaque assay results. 4.8 4.8 4.8 4.8 4.8. 3.8 *PEDV, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus; GE, genome equivalents; PIH, postinoculation hour; \u2013, no result (pig euthanized); ND, not determined. clinical signs and virus shedding were monitored after indirect contact. a standard curve was generated by using the PCR amplicon (PEDN 229/557) of strain PC21A. the detection limit was 10 GE per reaction, corresponding to 4.8 log10 and 3.8 log10 GE/mL. small and large intestine tissues, lung, liver, heart, kidney, spleen, and mesenteric lymph node were examined grossly and histologically. pigs 1 and 2 exhibited typical PEDV-like lesions. histologic lesions included acute diffuse, severe atrophic jejunitis. pig 4 was euthanized at a later stage of infection. gnotobiotic pigs inoculated with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus. intestine of pig 1 at postinoculation hour (PIH) 30 (4\u20135 h after onset of clinical signs), showing thin and transparent intestinal walls (duodenum to colon) and extended stomach filled with curdled milk. immunofluorescence-stained cells were observed mainly in the epithelium of atrophied villi of small (duodenum to ileum) and large intestines. a few immunofluorescence-stained cells were detected infrequently in the Peyer patches of pig 4. infected pigs tested at acute or later stages of infection had viral RNA titers of 4.8\u20137.6 log10 GE/mL. no infected pigs had detectable viral RNA in serum samples. the first US outbreaks of the rapidly spreading porcine virus, PEDV, caused a high number of pig deaths and substantial economic losses. the jejunum and ileum are the primary sites of infection."}
