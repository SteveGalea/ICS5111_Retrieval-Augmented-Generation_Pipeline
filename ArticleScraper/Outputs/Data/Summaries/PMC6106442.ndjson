{"summary": "the zombie becomes an \u201callegory of infectious disease\u201d and a \u201cmetaphor of ubiquitous contagion\u201d. the zombie becomes an \u201callegory of infectious disease\u201d and a \u201cmetaphor of ubiquitous contagion\u201d. infection has tended to become the primary cause of the zombie condition itself. the zombie dominates the horror fiction landscape because it has adapted well to the real-life scenario of pandemic outbreaks. in 2007\u2019s 28 Weeks Later, a woman and son appear to be immune to infection but carry the Rage virus to susceptible populations. symbiosis is advantageous to both partners in the host\u2013parasite relationship. the zombie condition is evolving heterogeneously, sometimes moving away from the image of the monstrous apocalyptic vector and into a more individually focused host\u2013parasite relationship. the zombie of Breathers or Warm Bodies can cohabit the same cultural space as the more traditional aggressors of seth Grahame-Smith\u2019s book Pride and Prejudice and Zombies and even zombie-like creatures. viruses replicate inefficiently, often creating different versions of themselves against which we have reduced or no immunological defense. the attributes of airborne transmission, high infection rate, and high virulence are the worst possible outcome for humanity because airborne transmission is extremely difficult to control or prevent, a high infection rate ensures high numbers of cases. the zombie incubation period in the novel is extended if a major blood vessel is missed during biting. this particular aspect of the virus is borrowed from rabies. a longer incubation period results from a bite to the leg rather than a bite to the neck. at least 1 of the popular reimaginings of the late postmillennial zombie proposes that zombified humans may have a new strain of prion disease. in the novel Zombie Autopsies: Secret Notes from the Apocalypse (41), the notes of a neurodevelopmental biologist describe the dissections of 3 zombie subjects before the author succumbs to the disease himself. zombies are a result of an ecoterrorism act that released a half-tested \u2018cure for the common cold\u2019 into the atmosphere. the novel\u2019s dormant pathogen is based on Toxoplasma gondii, a pathogen that would not wipe out the entire susceptible population. books like Zombie Autopsies show how new infectious zombie texts act as virological repositories. emerging infectious literatures are varied: some show clear horrific leanings. others are more obviously defined as science fiction or thrillers. novels about the future impact of antimicrobial resistance are as yet few and far between, but no less interesting. the book club format successfully allows discussion between experts and nonexperts about the overlap between pandemic fact and fiction. participants can focus on key messages about disease and infection that underpin the fiction narrative. the zombie trope has enabled exploration of our behaviors when confronted with infection."}
