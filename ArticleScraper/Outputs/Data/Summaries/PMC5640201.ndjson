{"summary": "autophagy is a multistep process that consists of isolation of cytoplasmic components into double-membrane vesicles that shuttle to lysosomes. it is a catabolic mechanism that enables the removal of damaged or excess cellular organelles and proteins, thereby contributing to cell homeostasis and survival. xLIR motif consists of a short amino acid sequence with a core motif originally described as W/F/YxxI/L/V. this sequence has lately been extended to 6 amino acids to integrate most of the experimentally verified LIRs. we have developed a database, iLIR@viral (http://ilir.uk/virus/), that organizes information on the presence of LIR motifs in viral proteins. a text-mining analysis of the literature allowed us to predict functional LIR motifs in viral proteins that have already been shown to associate with Atg8-family members. iLIR@Viral database \u2018Classification\u2019 menu allows the user to look in the database for a specific protein or virus order, family, subfamily, genus, species or common name. the 'Search' menu allows the user to look in the database for a specific protein or virus order, family, subfamily, genus, species or common name. from UniProt across 2569 individual viral species we found that 15,589 of them contain either xLIR or WxxL motifs. 6247 proteins contain both xLIR and WxxL motifs. 129 proteins contain only xLIR motifs. 188 species of bacteriophages belong to 188 species of bacteriophages. but these sequences correspond to false-positive hits as bacteria don't have an autophagy process. xLIR and WxxL patterns in LIRCPs were higher in viruses infecting eukaryotes than in bacteriophages. 45% and 38% of putative LIR motifs matching the WxxL pattern are of F-type and Y-type respectively. similar distribution could be observed for the putative xLIR motifs with a higher variability across families. the protein M2 from influenza A virus is necessary and sufficient for the inhibition of the autophagic degradation of the virus by blocking the fusion between the autophagosomes and lysosomes. the fact that M2 protein has been shown to block the autophagosome-lysosome fusion suggests that it may act as an adaptor protein. the proteins TRS1 from human cytomegalovirus and neurovirulence factor ICP34.5 from human herpesvirus (HSV) both interact with BECN1 via a specific BECN1-binding domain. this interaction is required for the inhibition of autophagosome maturation and fusion with the lysosomes. however, there is no evidence of association between ICP34.5 and LC3 proteins. checking for the presence of LIR motifs revealed a discrepancy. it is possible that the absence of either the xLIR or WxxL motifs in DENV-3 is responsible for its lower affinity to LC3 proteins. viral database is a web resource freely available to the academic community at http://ilir.uk/virus/. the \u2018Classification\u2019 menu gives access to the complete list of putative LIR motifs in viral proteins. two virus taxonomic systems have been used to name the species, genus and families of each of the viruses cited in the database. we have used position-specific iterative BLAST to search against the database. by default, the BLAST search runs against all the data available in the database with a default e-value 0.01. however, the user has the possibility to run the BLAST search against a specific category and define a different e-value. iLIR web resource can make the distinction between xLIR and WxxL patterns. the identification of putative LIR motifs has been done for all the reviewed sequences for viral proteins. 1517 sequences belong to 188 species of bacteriophages. phagy has been reported only in eukaryotes. 45% and 38% of the putative LIR motifs matching the WxxL pattern are of F-type and Y-type. xLIR motifs are the least represented, with about 17% of the patterns. similar distribution could be observed for putative xLIR motifs with a higher variability compared with WxxL patterns. the protein M2 from influenza A virus is necessary and sufficient for the inhibition of the autophagic degradation of the virus by blocking the fusion between the autophagosomes and lysosomes. the protein is necessary and sufficient for the inhibition of the autophagic degradation of the virus by blocking the fusion between the autophagosomes. 7% of the reviewed sequences that contain at least one putative LIR motif correspond to the genome polyprotein from various viruses. NS1 protein from dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2) colocalizes with LC3 and that DENV-2 particles and autophagosomes travel together during viral infection. the nonstructural protein NS5A from Hepatitis C virus colocalizes and can be coimmunoprecipitated with LC3 proteins when ectopically expressed in various hepatoma cell lines. the viral peptide 2BC and the protein 3A encoded by the genome polyprotein from Poliovirus type 1 interact with LC3-II. xLIR and WxxL patterns for viral proteins were identified using the approach suggested previously. the taxonomic lineage obtained from UniProt corresponds to the Baltimore classification system. the closer the value of Levenshstein distance to zero, the closer are the species names. using this approach, we could reliably justify the ICTV classification of 14055 out 15589 proteins loaded into the database. xLIR and WxxL patterns for these proteins were identified using the approach suggested previously. Levenshtein distance was used to compare the species name that belongs to a particular genus and family between both the classification systems. the distance between \u2018x\u2019 and \u2018y\u2019 is defined as the minimal number of characters required to replace, insert or delete to transform one string into another.
