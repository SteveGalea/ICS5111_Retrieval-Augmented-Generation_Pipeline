{"summary": "folding information is encoded within the protein sequence (6). folding information is key factor determining folding (4) and binding (5) mechanism of monomers and oligomers. in enzymes, these obligate complexes also constitute their active forms. guanidine-HCl (14) and cold-induced denaturation (10) lead to observation of an expanded monomer species that constitutes an intermediate state of its three-state folding mechanism N2 2I 2U. the first unfolding transition occurs concurrently with dimer dissociation (10), suggesting that these swollen states unfold further in a noncooperative fashion (18) a single-point mutant exists as a monomer at high protein concentrations. this mutant exists as a monomer at high protein concentrations. it is also fully compatible with the catalytic dimer of the WT protein. our results suggest that the isolated subunit of L93A is reminiscent of the first structural changes occurring upon dissociation of the native dimer of Pfk-2. a large portion of the -meander module is unaffected by dissociation. we first analyze the localized frustration of the individual binding partners and then of the native dimer to examine whether a given residue contributes to the stability of the monomer or also to the stability of the dimer. our goal was to find residues that specifically destabilized the dimer structure without stabilizing the monomer. SEC experiments were performed using a bio-Sil SEC 250 gel filtration column. the column was equilibrated with 60 ml of the mobile phase containing 0.2 M KCl. protein concentration ranged from 0.3 to 50 M. TCEP was used as a reducing agent. protein samples were centrifuged in the analytical cells at 41,000 rpm. the moving boundary was followed by absorbance at 280 nm. -2 was thermally unfolded in the absence or presence of 1 mM F6P. samples were heated between 25\u00b0C and 80\u00b0C at a rate of 3\u00b0C/h. every data point corresponds to the average of 4 scans. spectra were collected for each sample after several times of exposure to irradiation, ranging from 5 s to 4 min, to monitor possible radiation damage and protein aggregation. p(r) distributions were used for rapid ab initio shape modeling using DAMMIF (31) 1 out of 10 different models was selected. 5 l of protein (initial concentration of WT Pfk-2 = 30 M and 90 M, L93A = 20 M) were mixed with 55 l of deuterated standard buffer. the proteins were allowed to exchange at 25\u00b0C for 0\u20135 min. the exchange reaction was then quenched for 2 min at 1\u00b0C. spectrometer was set in MSE-ESI+ mode instead. the tandem mass spectrometry fragments were scored using the PLGS 3.0 software. deuterium uptake was determined by calculating the shift in the centroids of the mass envelopes for each peptide compared with the undeuterated controls. Purification and storage of Pfk-2 WT Pfk-2 and L93A mutant were purified and stored as in Babul (25). before the experiments, the protein was buffer exchanged by centrifugation using a micro bio-spin 6 column (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) with standard buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.2, 5 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM DTT, or 2 mM TCEP) protein elution volumes were converted to Rs values using the linear relationship obtained with the molecular-mass markers. the hydrodynamic radius of the L93A monomer was calculated by extrapolation to infinite dilution. the protein concentration for WT Pfk-2 and L93A without F6P was 17 M. samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 rpm in an Eppendorf microfuge. the hydrodynamic radius was calculated using the manufacturer\u2019s software via the Stokes-Einstein relationship. an initial stock of concentrated enzyme was first unfolded by exposure to 3 M GndHCl for 24 h at room temperature. the unfolded protein was then diluted against several concentrations of GndHCl in standard buffer. the refolded protein was measured after incubation for 6 h at room temperature. the resulting p(r) distributions were used for rapid ab initio shape modeling using DAMMIF (31) 1 out of 10 different models was selected. the structural similarity between the generated models of L93A with and without F6P against the crystal structure. the exchange reaction was quenched for 2 min at 1\u00b0C using an equal volume of a solution containing 100 mM phosphate buffer pH 2.66, 2 M GndHCl. the sample was then injected into a 50 l sample loop, followed by rapid online pepsin digestion at 15\u00b0C using a custom-built column made with pepsin-agarose. isolated monomer of E. coli Pfk-2 shifts the dimer-monomer equilibrium toward higher protein concentrations and experiences substrate-induced dimerization. we performed in silico estimations of the change in free energy due to substitutions of interfacial residues by alanine using the Robetta server (20) the largest changes in free energy are predicted by alanine substitution of residues 103\u2013108. the local frustration of this region and of strands 2 and 3 appears to be highly dependent on contacts made to an adjacent subunit. therefore, we chose to mutate residue L93 (Fig. 1 A) whose substitution by alanine is predicted to cause a destabilization of the interface of 1 kcal/mol. dimentation velocity experiments show that the L93A mutant is a monomer at low protein concentration. addition of F6P leads to substrate-induced dimerization of the L93A mutant (black triangles) with a sedimentation coefficient close to the native dimer of Pfk-2 (open squares) the estimated radius of gyration of the substrate-induced dimer of L93A in the presence of F6P is larger than the monomer. to further validate the results obtained for L93A, we performed intrinsic fluorescence measurements of the tryptophan residue W88 from Pfk-2. the fluorescence intensity of the L93A mutant is lower than the WT protein. the L93A mutant is a monomer at protein concentrations below 30 M. the estimated Stokes radius from DLS measurements is larger than the value obtained from DLS measurements at 20 M. this could be due to the presence of potassium, which is known to bind, stabilize, and enhance the activity of WT Pfk-2 (36) matic reaction was the same (4.3 103 M), irrespective of the original protein concentration. the catalytic constant of L93A at a protein concentration of 15 M is 12 s1. the enzyme becomes more active as the protein concentration increases and dimer is formed, reaching a maximum kcat of 23 s1 when the protein concentration is 150 s1. the sedimentation coefficient and the hydrodynamic radius of L93A Pfk-2 increase upon addition of 1 mM F6P. the hydrodynamic radius of the F6P-induced dimer of L93A Pfk-2 is 3.5 0.2 nm. further demonstration of the F6P-induced dimerization of L93A Pfk-2 comes from SAXS measurements. we calculated the molecular mass of L93A with and without F6P. both the radii of gyration and an ab initio shape model of the monomer and the substrate-induced dimer were obtained. the radii of gyration were 2.80 0.02 nm for the monomer and 3.27 0.01 nm for the dimer. cold-induced dissociation of this domain leads to the accumulation of an expanded isolated subunit with lesser secondary structure content that is marginally stable (10,16) we performed CD measurements of the L93A mutant at low protein concentration with and without F6P, showing that its secondary structure content increases upon dimerization. the ellipticity measured for the L93A mutant decreases almost linearly upon increasing the concentration of GndHCl. this change in secondary structure resembles the chemical unfolding of the cold-induced intermediate state of Pfk-2, which has a marginal stabilization free energy of 2.8 kcal/mol (10), although a sigmoidal transition was observed. the isolated monomer of L93A Pfk-2 is partially unstructured and larger than a compact monomer. a dimer resembles the native oligomer of WT Pfk-2. the mutant is marginally stable even in native conditions. analytical chromatography and last-generation mass spectrometry allows separation, identification, and analysis of many sequentially overlapping peptides. we were able to describe the extent of hydrogen/deuterium exchange of a total of 82 peptides from L93A Pfk-2, representing 98.7% of the total sequence coverage and a redundancy of 4.23. the L93A mutant exhibits a large difference in deuterium uptake in residues 118\u2013126 (MH+ = 1161.626) the isolated subunit obtained through the L93A substitution has overall higher deuterium uptake (Figs. 4 A and S6). peptide fragments 94\u2013103 (MH+ = 1090.507) and 104\u2013113 (MH+ = 1124.532) have an exchange difference of 1% and 9% when comparing the L93A mutant with the native dimer. the difference in deuterium uptake of peptide fragments that cover the small domain is consistent with the predicted local stability from the analysis. the dimer-monomer equilibrium toward higher protein concentrations has been achieved by modification of the environment. we performed in silico estimations of the change in free energy due to a single-point mutation on the interface, thus leading to destabilization of the quaternary structure. local frustration of this region and of strands 2 and 3 appears to be highly dependent on contacts made to an adjacent subunit. we chose to mutate residue L93 (Fig. 1 A) whose substitution by alanine is predicted to cause a destabilization of the interface of 1 kcal/mol and it is located on a region where local frustration is not dependent on subunit binding. the L93A mutant is a monomer (black circles) with a hydrodynamic radius of 2.9 nm. it can be guided toward formation of a dimer with a hydrodynamic radius of 3.5 nm. this value is close to the hydrodynamic radius estimated for the native dimer (open squares) 93A in the presence of F6P is larger than the monomer, in accordance with SEC and sedimentation velocity experiments. to further validate the results obtained for L93A, we performed intrinsic fluorescence measurements of the tryptophan residue W88 from Pfk-2. this showed that the fluorescence intensity of the L93A mutant is lower than the WT protein. the L93A mutant is a monomer at protein concentrations below 30 M. the estimated Stokes radius from DLS measurements is within error of the estimated hydrodynamic radius from sedimentation velocity experiments at 20 M. this could be due to the presence of potassium, known to bind, stabilize, and enhance the activity of WT Pfk-2 (36) the catalytic constant of L93A at a protein concentration of 15 M is 12 s1. the enzyme becomes more active as the protein concentration increases and dimer is formed, reaching a maximum kcat of 23 s1. at this concentration, the turnover number is about threefold lower than that for the wild type Pfk-2 at all assayed protein concentrations, 68 s1. the sedimentation coefficient and the hydrodynamic radius of L93A Pfk-2 increase upon addition of 1 mM F6P. the hydrodynamic radius of the F6P-induced dimer of L93A Pfk-2 is 3.5 0.2 nm. further demonstration of the F6P-induced dimerization comes from SAXS measurements. both the radii of gyration and an ab initio shape model of the monomer and the substrate-induced dimer were obtained. the radii of gyration were 2.80 0.02 nm for the monomer and 3.27 0.01 nm for the dimer. the radii of gyration were 2.80 0.02 nm for the monomer and 3.27 0.01 nm for the dimer. dissociation of this domain leads to the accumulation of an expanded isolated subunit with lesser secondary structure content that is marginally stable (10,16) to address these questions, we performed CD measurements of the L93A mutant at low protein concentration with and without F6P, showing that its secondary structure content increases upon dimerization. the ellipticity measured for the L93A mutant decreases almost linearly upon increasing the concentration of GndHCl. this change in secondary structure is accompanied by an almost linear increase in the hydrodynamic radius of the protein. this change in secondary structure is accompanied by an almost linear increase in the hydrodynamic radius of the protein, from 3.3 0.2 nm in the absence of chaotropic agent to 5.9 0.1 nm at 1.5 M GndHCl. the isolated monomer of L93A Pfk-2 is partially unstructured and larger than a compact monomer. a dimer resembles the native oligomer of WT Pfk-2. the mutant is marginally stable even in native conditions. we were able to describe the extent of hydrogen/deuterium exchange of a total of 82 peptides from L93A Pfk-2. this represents 98.7% of the total sequence coverage and a redundancy of 4.23. the highest difference in deuterium uptake is 59% in residues 276\u2013288 (MH+ = 1,219.679) the L93A mutant exhibits a large difference in deuterium uptake in residues 118\u2013126 (MH+ = 1161.626), which corresponds to an -helix and part of a strand of the central -sheet. the isolated subunit obtained through the substitution has overall higher deuterium uptake. the difference in deuterium uptake of peptide fragments that cover the small domain is consistent with the predicted local stability. the peptide fragment 118\u2013126 (sequence FRQLEEQVL) was also shown to exhibit a large structural change upon cold-denaturation. residues 152\u2013163 (sequence LISAAQKQGIRC) did not show significant changes in solvent accessibility (16). -2 follows a two-state mechanism resembling the N2 2I transition where dissociation and partial unfolding occur. the resulting monomeric intermediate therein was characterized as expanded and solvent-penetrated throughout the protein structure. the resulting monomeric intermediate therein was characterized as expanded and solvent-penetrated throughout the protein structure (16) residues 240\u2013309 that largely represent the last three -helices of the -meander module of the major domain of Pfk-2 remain as folded as in the WT native dimer. the -meander module is not part of the folding cooperative unit of Pfk-2. the -meander module is not part of the folding cooperative unit of Pfk-2. kinetic unfolding of Pfk-2 followed by CD shows a biphasic behavior. fast phase has been associated with structural changes of a region of the protein that is not related to the folding cooperative unit, namely the -meander. the noncooperativity of L93A is explained by the hydration of its hydrophobic core. HDXMS analysis of the cold-denatured state of WT Pfk-2 (16) and this study of L93A Pfk-2 demonstrated that these isolated monomers have increased amide exchange throughout the hydrophobic core. this can be interpreted as an increase in water-mediated interactions despite the direct native contacts that stabilize the hydrophobic core. our results show that destabilization of the interface between subunits through the L93A mutation also leads to a monomeric species with larger hydrodynamic radius than expected for a compact subunit. we propose that this coupling between domains is a consequence of the reentrant chain topology of Pfk-2. the small domain of Pfk-2 emerges as a topological discontinuity (13), thus reentering and interrupting the chain topology of the major domain. the major domain of Pfk-2 remain as folded as in the native dimer. the -meander module is not part of the folding cooperative unit of Pfk-2. this is consistent with the fact that none of the chain crossings between the major domain and the interface domain interrupt the chain topology. the ribokinase superfamily -meander module experiences a topological reordering through a noncyclic permutation. the noncooperativity of the -meander is explained by the hydration of its hydrophobic core. the isolated monomer is more compact than the cold-denatured and GndHCl-denatured ensembles. most of the central -sheet that constitutes the structure of the structure of Pfk-2 is solvent accessible in the L93A mutant. these solvent-penetrated ensembles are usually seen as a result of cold (52) and pressure denaturation (53), although denaturants are generally considered to facilitate solvation of hydrophobic regions of proteins (54)."}
