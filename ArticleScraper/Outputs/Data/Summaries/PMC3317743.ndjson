{"summary": "the most important property of this group of proteins is to serve as transporters for a variety of endogenous and exogenous compounds including metabolites, drugs and other biologically active substances. bovine serum albumin (BSA) is one of the most extensively studied of this group of proteins, particularly because of its structural homology with human serum albumin (HSA) dehydration is a post-crystallization treatment that tries to overcome the problems of loose packing of molecules and large solvent content. this procedure has previously been reported to increase the diffraction limit of many protein crystals. crystals obtained from a crystallization solution containing 22\u201324% w/v MPEG 5K, 0.2M MgCl2, 0.1 M Tris HCl pH 7.8, 8.0 and 8.2 and BSA at 20.0 mg mL1 failed. diffraction data collected at 100 K showed even the best crystals were intrinsically disordered. a number of different trials for dehydrating crystals have been described in the literature. the dehydration process has been applied with success to crystals of proteins of various molecular weights, protein-protein and protein-ligand complexes. protein crystal reference Crystal precipitanta Dehydrating agent Dehydration treatment Space group (SG) Solvent content b before (%) Solvent content b after (%) RH before (%) Resolution before() Resoluti on after (bSA) This work 22% MPEG 5K 30% PEG 8K Transfer to drop of dehydr soln, 10 min C2 50\u201353 47 99.2 98.5 8 e 3.2 e DsbG [24] 20% PEG 4K 30% PEG 4K Transfer both the well and hangdrop solutions with dehydr soln C2 NR NR 99.6 99.0 3\u20138 d 2.1 d transamidosome [33] 10% PEG 4K 30% PEG 400 10% PEG 4K Replacing the reservoir solution with dehydr soln P212121 to P21 upon dehydr NR 65 99.8 97.1 4.0 d 3.0 d X (or ADRP domain of a variant of feline coronavirus [34] 6 12e 2.6 e 2.0 d 3-Dehydro dehy [25] 11% PEG 8K Ppt 10% glycerol Annealing+air dehydrate (15 min) P21 NR 88 99.8 97.9 ND 3.0 d Rv2002 gene product [38] 20% PEG 3K Ppt 10% MPD Anneal + air dehydrate, 5 h P312 1 NR 35 NC NC 2.1 d 1.8 d Peptide NR NR 8.0 d 2.9 d F1-ATPase [44] 14% PEG 6K Controlled relative humidity device P212121 NR Reduction of 22% 99 90 NR 1.9 d Dipeptidyl peptidase IV [45] 20\u201322% PEG 2K Controlled relative humidity device P212121 NR Reduction of 22% 99 90 NR 1.9 d ApoA-IV [53] 22\u201328% PEG 3.4K 60% steps to drop of dehydr soln P213 54 53 99.8\u201399.7 98.9\u201398.4 4.3 e 3.7 e HIV-RT:inhibitor [58] 6% PEG 3.4K 46% PEG 3.4K Serial transfer, 3 days P212121 56 48 99.9 95.5 3.7 e 2.2 e Pp 1,2-CCD [59] 14% PEG 8K 16\u201318% PEG 8K 20 % gly e 2.0 e Trehalose phosphorylase [27] 10% PEG 4K 18% PEG 4K Various procedures P212121 NR 60 99.8 99.5 7\u20138 d 3\u20134 d Glutaryl-7-aminocephalosporanic acid acylase [62] 4% PEG 8K 10\u201320% PEG 4K 30% PEG 8K 20% glycerol Transfer to drop of dehydr soln P212121 NR NR NC NC 4 to drop of dehydr soln, 36 h P21 NR 63 99.8 99.8 8 d 3.1 d Ferredoxin reductase [69] 16\u201318% PEG 10K 20% PEG 4K Transfer to drop of dehydr soln, 15min P32211 NR 53 99.6\u201399.5 99.3 NR 2.2 d MHC HLA-DQ2 complexed with gliadin peptides [70] 25% PEG steps to drop of dehydr soln P3121 62 60 99.8 98.5 15 d 2.9 d F1-ATPase [78] 20% PEG 6K 20% PEG 6K 20% PEG 400 Serial transfer into dehydr soln P212121 NR 62 NC NC 6\u20138 d 3.1 d EF-Tu-Ts [79] 20% PEG 4K 28%\u201340%, var PEGs Serial transfer, 5 min each P212121 61 3.8 e 3.4 e SeMet YidC [84] 22% PEG 3350 10% EG 30% PEG 3.4K 5\u201315% PEG 400 Serial transfer into dehydr soln C2 50 47 NC NC 3.5 e 1.8 e DENV 3 RdRp [85] 0.5% MPEG 5K Var procedures C2221 NR 59 NC NC 20 d 1.8 d AS, ammonium sulphate, BD, bad diffraction;
