{"summary": "the outbreak spread rapidly through an earthquake-devastated country. in less than one month after initial detection, cholera had spread across the ten departments of Haiti and into neighboring Dominican Republic. key to response support was the alert and response (A&R) system set up in early November of 2010 in collaboration with the MSPP. the increase in IDPs put pressure on host populations and local healthcare systems. in early 2010, national epidemiological information in Haiti came from two sentinel systems, one managed by the Cuban Medical Brigades. the lack of experience and capacity of local actors in assessment resulted in an underestimation of the speed at which cholera would become a major outbreak across the country. a national response strategy against cholera was developed by the MSPP with technical support from PAHO/WHO, CDC, and other United Nations agencies and partners. a case definition for cholera was commonly agreed on among the MSPP, PAHO, CDC, and other partners. from mid-December of 2010, the case definition included any person with three or more liquid stools with or without vomiting in a department affected by cholera. information produced was untimely and insufficient for real-time monitoring and to direct a rapid, targeted response. cholera reports were generally published by the MSPP with a two to three week time lapse. information on community cases and deaths was not included. the impact of the earthquake on the structures of the health sector was dramatic. the three most affected departments in the country experienced severe damage or complete destruction of 60% of their hospitals. the impact of the earthquake on the structures of the health sector was dramatic. the emergence of cholera, an epidemic disease new to Haiti, made the already difficult humanitarian situation even more complex. the lack of health facilities in many areas and any practical knowledge about cholera as well as the poor pre- and post-earthquake water, sanitation, and living conditions throughout Haiti posed a major public health threat as cholera began to spread. as of October 31, 2010, the epidemic was already affecting five of ten departments in Haiti. the national health system had been able to detect and confirm the outbreak etiology but required external support to monitor the spread of the disease and direct and coordinate response. data collected were analyzed at the national level. daily reports with the number of cases and deaths, institutional and global case-fatality rates, and epidemic curves for each department were posted on the MSPP website: www.mspp.gouv.ht. early warning functions of surveillance are fundamental for national, regional, and global health security. the regulations were unanimously approved by the world health assembly in may 2005. they constitute a significant advance in global surveillance and public health security. the PAHO\u2013MSPP A&R system was based on a network of partners supported by the health cluster mechanism. the system was composed of a national alert team based in port-au-Prince and the PAHO/WHO field teams based at the departmental level covering all departments in Haiti. the health cluster leadership was assigned to the WHO, signifying that it should ensure coordination of response activities by international actors in health in an affected country. the focal points in the field were the MSPP\u2013PAHO/WHO A&R field teams. these teams consisted of two experts with experience in cholera. the PAHO\u2013MSPP A&R system initially focused on the detection of any cholera event requiring an immediate response. the focus was widened to cover any event that could pose a public health risk using the framework established by the IHR (2005). the focus was widened to cover any event that could pose a public health risk using the framework established by the IHR (2005). information received from official or reliable sources, such as health cluster members, was considered as verified. verification was carried out either directly by the A&R coordinator or the field teams in place or through the network of partners in the field. the initial A&R System objectives were to (1) save lives through early detection and treatment of cholera cases and (2) control the spread of cholera through early intervention at the community level. the main activities of the system were to (1) identify and assess cholera alerts and hotspots and (2) organize a rapid response with partners to provide immediate support. response clusters consist of groups of humanitarian organizations (UN and non-UN) working in humanitarian action sectors, such as shelter and health. they provide a clear point of contact for the partnerships created across international, national, and local authorities and civil society. the primary operational components of the PAHO\u2013MSPP A&R System were (1) the alert/early warning function; (2) a process of verification and assessment of alerts; and (3) a response function. the primary operational components of the PAHO\u2013MSPP A&R System were (1) the alert/early warning function; (2) a process of verification and assessment of alerts; and (3) a response function. the focus was widened to cover any event that could pose a public health risk using the framework established by the IHR (2005). field teams reported alerts detected on the same day in the shortest time possible and at least on a daily basis. weekly reports were generated, highlighting the number of alerts received during the week. response was coordinated at the national hub in port-au-Prince by the A&R coordinator. response was coordinated by the PAHO/WHO field teams and the MSPP staff at the departmental level. in humanitarian emergencies, the arrival of many new players poses an additional challenge and compromises the capacity of understaffed. alert criteria and types of alerts to be collected were standardized. the focus was widened to cover any event that could pose a public health risk using the framework established by the IHR (2005). field teams reported alerts detected on the same day in the shortest time possible. response function was coordinated at the national hub in port-au-Prince by the A&R coordinator. response was coordinated in collaboration with PAHO's emergency preparedness and disaster advisor and PAHO's logistic officer. in humanitarian emergencies, the arrival of many new players poses an additional challenge and compromises the capacity of understaffed and overwhelmed national and local authorities to lead the public health response. alerts referred to unique events defined by a specific occurrence in a set location and date. follow-up information of a specific event was not counted as a new alert. alerts with information concerning a location previously reported in another alert were counted as new. warnings for the first year of functioning of the A&R System were Grande Anse (17.2%), Ouest (13.6%; metropolitan area excluded), and the metropolitan area (12.8%; Port-au-Prince) followed by Artibonite (10.6%) the most cholera alerts were related to cholera. the sensitivity of the system and its ability to react quickly was illustrated in early may of 2011. the sensitivity of the system and its ability to react quickly was illustrated in early may of 2011. a rapid risk assessment was done by the MSPP and partners. the national cholera surveillance system did not register an increase in cases until EWs 21\u201322 of 2011. the national cholera surveillance system did not register an increase in cases until EWs 21\u201322 of 2011, and this information, aggregated by department, was not available until EWs 23\u201324. the guiding principle for sharing information was to help responders achieve the best use of their resources. the national surveillance system was strengthened through establishing the basis for an event-based component within the Haitian national surveillance system in the context of the IHR (2005) requirements. 863 alerts on public health events were received by the PAHO/MSPP A&R System from November 8, 2010 to November 6, 2011, with an average of 17 alerts per week. alerts referred to unique events defined by a specific occurrence in a set location and date; follow-up information of a specific event was not counted as a new alert. the majority of the alerts were related to cholera. the majority of the alerts (89.6%) were related to cholera. the system also detected 76 non-cholera alerts. over 95% of the alerts received had a documented response, and the remainder had no documented response. sensitivity of the system and its ability to react quickly was illustrated in early may of 2011. the MSPP and partners were alerted of the high risk of further spread into the Ouest Department and specifically, to the metropolitan area of port-au-Prince. this alert proved of vital importance given the fact that several partners were scaling down cholera activities. two weeks later, by May 21, a significant increase in cholera alerts was reported in the metropolitan area. the national cholera surveillance system did not register an increase in cases until EWs 21\u201322 of 2011. information on filtered alerts for each day was compiled on a daily alerts bulletin. the guiding principle for sharing information was to help responders achieve the best use of their resources. the system is still operating, with the MSPP supporting the epidemiologists of the PAHO/WHO country office. a statistician has been trained to analyze data from all departments. improved national surveillance and response systems are key elements to prevent and contain epidemics. the investigation that followed each alert identified major gaps in prevention and response. a main strength of the system was the immediate feedback and action that followed reporting. the strong collaboration of all partners in identifying hotspots, verifying rumors, and collectively supporting the response was key to the success of the A&R System. to address continuing challenges for surveillance in Haiti, there is a need to, first, get an efficient and functional system and second, ensure technical support is made available."}
