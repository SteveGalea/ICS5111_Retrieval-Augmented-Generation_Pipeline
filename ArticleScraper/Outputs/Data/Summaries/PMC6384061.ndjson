{"summary": "intestinal epithelium is composed of villi and crypts, and the self-renewing stem cells in the crypt zone are responsible for the renewal of an entire unit. enteroids derived from intestinal crypts contain a stem cell niche and diverse highly polarized intestinal epithelial cell types (enterocytes, goblets, enteroendocrine cells, and Paneth cells) PEDV is highly enteropathogenic, primarily infects the villous epithelia of the small intestine, blunts the affected villi, and disrupts mucosal barrier integrity in vivo. most in vitro studies of PEDV have been performed in nonporcine cell lines, such as vero cells from africa green monkey kidney and HEK293 cells from human embryonic kidney (16\u201318). porcine enteroids recapitulate the key properties of the in vivo intestinal epithelium. we generated primary porcine enteroid cultures derived from piglet intestinal crypts containing leucine-rich-repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5)-positive (Lgr5+) stem cells. the crypt cells proliferated and differentiated into 3D enteroids. ileal enteroid single cells grew into enteroids in 7 days. we developed a porcine crypt-derived 3D enteroid culture system. small spheroids form on day 3 after crypt isolation, gradually mature over time. 3D ileal enteroids can generate planar enteroid monolayers with proper apical and basal polarity. the 3D enteroids that were expanded in Matrigel were harvested, mechanically dissociated, and seeded on Matrigel-coated microplates to establish 2D enteroids. a lumen-like structure was identified in the differentiated planar 2D ileal enteroids. a planar swine enteroid culture can be generated from intestinal crypt stem cells. porcine intestinal enteroids are susceptible to PEDV infection. ileal enteroids were confirmed through an anti-PEDV nucleocapsid immunofluorescence assay. successful PEDV infection in ileal enteroids resulted in a significant cytopathic effect and disruption of the enteroid structure starting at 24 hpi. this structure continued to deteriorate over time. protein was detected with mouse anti-PEDV N mAb (red) DAPI was used to stain cellular nuclei (blue). DAPI was used to stain cellular nuclei (blue) ileum was collected from piglets inoculated orally with PEDV. specific cell marker (green) and PEDV S (red) double-labeled cells are indicated by light blue arrows. DAPI (blue) was used for nuclear staining. PEDV infects ileal enteroids compared with colonoids. crypt stem cells were distributed widely in the proliferative zone of the crypt. PEDV protein was occasionally observed in Ki-67+ proliferating epithelial cells. the number of PEDV genome copies in ileal enteroids at 72 hpi was increased only approximately 5-fold compared with that at 2 hpi. the number of PEDV genome copies in ileal enteroids was substantially elevated from 24 to 72 hpi to reach values at 72 h that were 1,527-fold higher than those at 2 hpi. a clinical PEDV isolate shows better propagation in ileal enteroids than the cell-adapted strain CV777. PEDV-JMS in ileal enteroids produced up to 473-fold-higher viral genomes than those obtained with PEDV-CV777. PEDV-JMS exhibits better infection in ileal enteroids than CV777. PEDV-JMS propagated better in enteroids than PEDV-CV777. enteroids can be a good culture system for isolating clinical PEDV isolates. type III IFN lambda 1 (IFN-L1) by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR. PEDV-JMS caused a rapid and substantial reduction in the expression of IFN- and IFN-L1 transcripts. this decrease was followed by the induction of IFN expression after 24 hpi. however, the IFN- and IFN-L1 expression kinetics were not identical. FN- (A) or IFN-L1 (B) after PEDV-JMS infection (MOI = 5) was assessed by relative RT-qPCR. IFN-L1 induces potent ISG expression and inhibits PEDV infection in ileal enteroids. IFN-L1 induced significantly higher levels of ISG15, OASL, MxA, and IFITM1 in enteroids than IFN-. both IFN-L1 and IFN- inhibited PEDV infection in enteroids in a dose-dependent manner. IFN-L1 showed stronger antiviral activity against PEDV than IFN-. ileal enteroids proliferated and differentiated into 3D enteroids. crypt cells from all three small intestine regions could grow into enteroids. ileal enteroids were subjected to a freeze-thaw cycle and then differentiated. small spheroids form on day 3 after crypt isolation, gradually mature over time, and form budding-like crypt structures on day 7. ileal enteroids from frozen-thawed enteroid cells were enzymatically dissociated into single cells and seeded onto precoated 96-well plates to differentiate for 3 days. dissociated 3D mouse enteroids can generate planar enteroid monolayers with proper apical and basal polarity. the 3D ileal enteroids that were expanded in Matrigel were harvested, mechanically dissociated, and seeded on Matrigel-coated microplates to establish 2D enteroids. a large number of villin-positive enterocytes were present throughout the 2D monolayers. porcine intestinal enteroids are susceptible to PEDV infection. we inoculated porcine ileal enteroids with the clinical isolate PEDV-JMS at increasing multiplicities of infection (MOIs) at 48 h postinfection the numbers of PEDV genomes were substantially increased to levels 34- to 754-fold higher than their levels at 2 hpi. cytopathic effect and disruption of the enteroid structure started at 24 hpi. cytopathic effect and disruption of the enteroid structure continued to deteriorate over time. PEDV successfully infects enteroids and establishes a productive infection. intestinal enteroids contain multiple-cell-type compositions. we then took advantage of the multiple cellular phenotypes of intestinal enteroids. we then sought to clarify whether PEDV targets specific cell types in the porcine intestinal enteroids through double-immunofluorescence labeling. ileum samples were collected from piglets inoculated orally with PEDV. specific cell marker (green) and PEDV S (red) double-labeled cells are indicated by light blue arrows. DAPI (blue) was used for nuclear staining. 67-positive cells were distributed widely in the proliferative zone of the crypt and reached the waist area of villi. PEDV protein was occasionally observed in Ki-67+ proliferating epithelial cells and to a lesser degree in Muc2+ goblet cells. PEDV preferentially infects ileal enteroids compared with colonoids. in ileal enteroids was significantly elevated from 24 to 72 hpi. at the same MOIs, ileal enteroids produced up to 44-fold more infectious particles than colonic enteroids. the discrepancy in infection between ileal enteroids and colonoids was further confirmed by a PEDV N protein IFA. planar ileal enteroids or colonoids were infected with PEDV at an MOI of 5. level of PEDV infection at 48 hpi was detected by staining with anti-PEDV N mAb. a clinical PEDV isolate shows better propagation in ileal enteroids. PEDV-JMS propagated better in enteroids than PEDV-CV777. enteroids can be a good culture system for isolating clinical PEDV isolates. PEDV infection suppresses the production of type I and III IFN. fected control, PEDV-JMS caused a rapid and substantial reduction in the expression of IFN- and IFN-L1 transcripts. PEDV infection inhibits the induction of type I and III IFN at the early stage of infection. however, the expression kinetics were not identical. IFN-L1 induces potent ISG expression and inhibits PEDV infection in ileal enteroids. IFN-L1 induces potent interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression. IFN-L1 and IFN- inhibited PEDV infection in enteroids in a dose-dependent manner. IFN-L1 showed stronger antiviral activity against PEDV than IFN-. intestinal enteroids present a good in vitro model for evaluating the innate response to PEDV infection. current in vitro cell culture models of PEDV include Vero cells (29), MARC-145 cells (another monkey kidney cell line), HEK293 cells (30) and IPEC-J2 cells (21, 31) most of these are nonporcine intestinal epithelial cells and thus not the ideal in vitro cellular models for studying the interaction between PEDV infection and the host response due to interspecific variation. the same donor allow assessment of the contributions of different intestinal segments to PEDV infection. previous studies and our results have shown that PEDV largely infects the epithelial cells of the small intestine and occasionally infects colon epithelial cells. piglet age is associated with piglet age, which is associated with piglet age. crypt stem cells are involved in the pathogenesis of PEDV infection. however, whether PEDV directly infects crypt stem cells is unknown. porcine enteroids can be used to model the multicellular phenotype of the intestinal epithelium, which serves as the primary portal through which enteric viruses enter the hosts. swine enteroids can be used as a unique model to define the complicated cross talk that exists between PEDV and the intestinal epithelium. the vero cell-adapted PEDV-CV777 strain was propagated as previously described (40, 41) the PEDV-JMS strain (passage 6) was isolated and stocked by our laboratory. the plate was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 10 min until the Matrigel solidified. 300 l of IntestiCult organoid growth medium was then added to each well. the culture medium was exchanged every 3 to 4 days. the piglets in group 2 were inoculated with 1.0 ml of DMEM. all clinical signs were recorded on a daily basis after virus infection. all the piglets were euthanized at 4 days postinfection. formalin-fixed ileum sections were serially dehydrated with 70%, 95%, and 100% ethanol; cleared in xylene; embedded in paraffin wax; and sectioned at a 4- to 6-m thickness. the slide was immersed in a citric acid (pH 7.4)\u2013sodium citrate buffer solution (pH 8.0) for 30 min for antigen retrieval. mouse anti-PEDV spike protein monoclonal antibody (mAb) 6E5 was diluted 1:200 in PBS. slides were incubated with goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody in the dark for 30 min at room temperature. slides were then dehydrated with ascending concentrations (70%, 95%, and 100%) of ethanol. mouse anti-PEDV nucleocapsid mAb 2G3 was stocked in our laboratory (1:180 dilution) cells were labeled with secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 donkey polyclonal antibody against rabbit IgG (1:1,000; Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) the cells were visualized using an Evos FL Auto2 fluorescence microscope. African green monkey kidney cells (Vero E6) were grown and maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) supplemented with antibiotics (100 U/ml penicillin and 100 g/ml streptomycin) and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) the crypt pellets were harvested by centrifugation at 200 g at 4\u00b0C for 5 min. they were seeded into a 48-well plate at a density of 50 crypts per well. the plate was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 10 min until the Matrigel solidified. four 10-day-old piglets were randomly divided into two groups. the piglets were orally inoculated with 1.0 ml of 4.5 105 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID50) of the PEDV-JMS strain. all clinical signs were recorded on a daily basis after virus infection. ileum sections were serially dehydrated with 70%, 95%, and 100% ethanol. the slide was immersed in a citric acid buffer solution (pH 7.4)\u2013sodium citrate buffer solution. mouse anti-PEDV spike protein monoclonal antibody (mAb) 6E5 was diluted 1:200 in PBS. after overnight incubation, the tissue sections were subjected to three 10-min washes with PBS. slides were then incubated with goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody. the surface differentiation markers of intestinal epithelial cells were detected using primary anti-Ki-67 (1 g/ml; abcam, USA) for proliferative cells, anti-Lgr5 (1:50; Novus Biologicals, USA) for stem cells, anti-mucin 2 (1:50; abcam, USA) for goblet cells, antivillin (1:100; abcam, USA) and anti-chromogranin A (1:100; Santa Cruz, USA) slides were imaged using a Carl Zeiss microscope (LSM700; Carl Zeiss, Heidenheim, Germany) with the appropriate filter set. all the results in the figures are presented, wherever appropriate, as means the standard errors of the mean."}
