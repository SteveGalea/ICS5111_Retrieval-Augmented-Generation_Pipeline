{"summary": "despite 30 years of intensive research, no effective vaccine formulations are available to prevent the transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). the recent RV144 trial showed an estimated 31.2% efficacy of protection (1) and, most significantly, revealed a positive correlation of protection with the presence of serum IgG binding antibodies (Abs) to variable region 2 (V2) of the envelope (Env) glycoprotein of HIV-1 (2, 3). these results confirmed the role of antibodies in an effective HIV-1 vaccine rabbit monoclonal antibody (RMAb) platform monitors specificity and neutralizing activities of antibodies elicited by a candidate HIV-1 Env immunogen. rabbit is highly immunogenic in responding to various immunization regimens to produce high-titer antibody responses. rabbit antibodies carry limited background reactivity to testing antigens. gp120 DNA plasmid was produced in the HB101 strain of Escherichia coli. secreted gp120 proteins from stably transfected CHO cell lines were harvested. each rabbit was immunized three times at weeks 0, 2, and 4 with JR-FL gp120 DNA vaccine. supernatant from hybridoma culture was sent back to UMMS for screening of gp120-specific antibodies. plates were washed five times with ELISA washing buffer (EWB; PBS containing 0.1% Triton-X) and blocked overnight at 4\u00b0C in PBS containing whey dilution buffer. 96-well microtiter plates were coated with overlapping peptides of HIV-1 consensus subtype B Env at 4 g/ml for 1 h. the reaction was stopped with 25 l of 2N H2SO4. gp120 antigens were subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. one-step reverse transcriptase PCR was carried out by adding 6 l H2O, 12.5 l reaction mix, 2.5 l each of the forward and backward primers. antibody heavy-chain and light-chain gene products were separately cloned into a mammalian expression vector, pJW4303. rabbit MAb was purified using protein A-Sepharose columns. phylogenetic trees were constructed using maximum-likelihood methods. protein A-coated tips were loaded with rabbit MAbs at 10 g/ml diluted in the buffer of PBS\u20130.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)\u20130.002% Tween 20. the biosensor tip was then put into wells containing the selected gp120 proteins at 3-fold serially diluted concentrations of from 100 to 11 nM in loading buffer. the codon-optimized gene segment coding for the gp120 region of HIV-1 isolate JR-FL (19) was subcloned into the pJW4303 DNA vaccine vector for the DNA priming phase of the immunization. each rabbit was immunized three times at weeks 0, 2, and 4 with JR-FL gp120 recombinant protein formulated in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) for each boost. the rabbit hybridoma fusion partner cells were developed previously (20) and further optimized to facilitate the generation of rabbit hybridoma cell lines. supernatant from hybridoma culture was sent back to UMMS for screening of gp120-specific antibodies. 96-well microtiter plates were coated with overlapping peptides of HIV-1 consensus subtype B Env at 4 g/ml for 1 h and blocked overnight. gp120 antigens were subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, as previously described. membranes were washed with blocking buffer after each step. Western Light substrate was then applied to the membranes for 5 min. one-step reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) amplification of hybridoma cell RNA. antibody heavy-chain and light-chain gene products were separately cloned into a mammalian expression vector, pJW4303. equal amounts of heavy- and light-chain plasmid DNAs were transfected with 293Fectin into freestyle 293F cells. luciferase assay reagent was added to 105 TZM-bl cells in a final concentration of 20 g/ml DEAE dextran. plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 48 h and developed with luciferase assay reagent according to manufacturer's instructions. rate rabbit MAb-gp120 association was measured using a 3-min interval followed by putting the sensor in wells containing regenerating buffer (500 mM phosphoric acid) the sensorgrams were corrected with the blank reference and fitted with a 1:1 binding model with the global fitting function. rabbit spleen was harvested 4 days after the final protein boost. 57 hybridoma cells (multiclonal stage) were screened for their supernatant reactivity to the JR-FL gp120 antigen. a smaller fraction (17 hybridoma cells; 30%) had various levels of positivity against denatured gp120 antigen. the epitope specificity of these RMAbs was determined by an ELISA against linear peptides (15 amino acid -aa) residues each with 11 aa overlapping. these 12 rabbit hybridoma cell lines could be divided into 5 groups based on their antigen epitope specificity. e sequence, R53 binds to the bridging sheet of gp120, a rare epitope reported only in a mouse study in the early days of HIV-1 research. one unique feature of R53 is that it can bind to two discontinuous linear epitopes in the C1 and C4 regions. three RMAbs (R20, R56, and R53) have been cocrystalized with their respective targeted peptides, as described above for the epitope-mapping analysis. broad binding profile and high affinity of RMAbs for gp120 proteins from different clades of HIV-1. RMAbs were individually characterized for their ability to bind well to a panel of five recombinant gp120 proteins. the other two V3 RMAbs, R20 and R43, bind gp120 proteins from JR-FL and the clade A isolate, 92UG037, better than they bind the other three gp120 proteins from the clade C, D, and E isolates. this is consistent with overlapping peptide ELISA and phylogenic lineage (Fig. 6) results. three RMAbs (R15, R41, and R35) uniformly bind to two gp120 proteins from clade B (JR-FL) and clade A (92UG037) with high efficiency. low to no detectable was observed for the other four gp120 proteins tested. the binding kinetics of three selected RMAbs, R56, R53, and R15, to 3-fold serial dilution of JR-FL gp120 protein. the full-length IgG heavy-chain and light-chain genes of the RMAbs were sequenced. most of the isolated RMAb genes preferentially utilized IGHV1S40*01 as the germ line family gene. the mean heavy-chain variable (VH) gene mutation frequency of human antibodies induced by repeated vaccination is 5% (31, 32) heavy-chain V genes exhibited an average SHM rate of 14.6% 9.2% (ranging from 5 to 27%) at the amino acid. light-chain V genes showed an average SHM rate of 9.25% 1.5%. the mutated amino acids for heavy chains were mainly distributed in the CDR1 and CDR2 regions. the light-chain CDR3 region contained an average length of 10.9 6.5 aa (ranging from 6 to 23 aa) a screening neutralization assay was conducted using an in-house TZM-bl assay at the university of Massachusetts Medical School to first identify those RMAbs with possible neutralizing activities. a small panel of pseudotyped viruses expressing HIV-1 Env antigens from clade B viruses representing both neutralization-sensitive (tier 1) and neutralization-resistant (tier 2) primary isolates showed positive neutralizing activities in this initial screening assay. a high-throughput neutralizing assay was conducted at Monogram, Inc., using its PhenoSense assay system. RMAb R56, R53, and R15 were tested against three highly sensitive viruses in addition to 13 primary isolates covering clades A to AE. SF162 and QH0692 confirmed the screening assay results. tier 1 clade B virus SF162.LS, clade C virus MW965.26, and clade AG virus DJ263.8 exhibited moderate to low neutralizing activities against three tier 1 clade B viruses. one tier 1 clade C virus (TV1.21), one clade AE virus (Th023.6) and one clade AG virus (T271-11) at low potency. the in-house test and the in-house test used TZM-bl cells. several tier 1 isolates, such as SS1196 and 6535, are much less sensitive to neutralization than the highly sensitive SF162 strain. rabbit spleen was harvested 4 days after the final protein boost. 57 hybridoma cells (multiclonal stage) were screened for their supernatant reactivity to the JR-FL gp120 antigen. a smaller fraction (17 hybridoma cells; 30%) had various levels of positivity against denatured JR-FL gp120 antigen. the epitope specificity of these RMAbs was determined by an ELISA against linear peptides (15 amino acid -aa) residues each with 11 aa overlapping. these 12 rabbit hybridoma cell lines could be divided into 5 groups based on their antigen epitope specificity. tope peptide sequence, R53 binds to the bridging sheet of gp120. it can bind to two discontinuous linear epitopes in the C1 and C4 regions. this hybridoma binds to the far C terminus of gp120. three RMAbs (R20, R56, and R53) have been cocrystalized with their respective targeted peptides. RMAbs were cloned from these hybridoma cells by RT-PCR. the gene transcripts of the full-length IgG heavy chains and light chains from the above-described RMAbs were subcloned into a mammalian protein expression vector. the other two V3 RMAbs, R20 and R43, bind gp120 proteins from JR-FL and the clade A isolate, 92UG037, better than they bind the other three gp120 proteins from the clade C, D, and E isolates. this is consistent with overlapping peptide ELISA and phylogenic lineage (Fig. 6) results. three RMAbs (R15, R41, and R35) uniformly bind to two gp120 proteins from clade B (JR-FL) and clade A (92UG037) with high efficiency. low to no detectable was observed for the other four gp120 proteins tested. binding kinetics of three selected RMAbs, R56, R53, and R15. gene sequence analysis of HIV-1 gp120-specific RMAbs. most of isolated RMAb heavy-chain and light-chain genes preferentially utilized IGHV1S40*01 as the germ line family gene. the mean heavy-chain variable (VH) gene mutation frequency of human antibodies induced by repeated vaccination is 5% (31, 32) heavy-chain V genes exhibited an average SHM rate of 14.6% 9.2% (ranging from 5% to 27%) light-chain V genes showed an average SHM rate of 9.25% 1.5%. the mutated amino acids for heavy chains were mainly distributed in the CDR1 and CDR2 regions. the light-chain CDR3 region contained an average length of 10.9 6.5 aa (ranging from 6 to 23 aa) a screening neutralization assay was conducted using an in-house TZM-bl assay. it was used with a small panel of pseudotyped viruses expressing HIV-1 Env antigens from clade B viruses representing both neutralization-sensitive (tier 1) and neutralization-resistant (tier 2) primary isolates. 3 showed positive neutralizing activities in this initial screening assay. RMAbs, a high-throughput neutralizing assay was conducted at Monogram, Inc., using its PhenoSense assay system.

DISCUSSION Human monoclonal antibodies against HIV-1 Env have played an important role in helping scientists understand the structural features of potential immunogen designs. a new group of bnAbs recognized the C-terminal part of the V3 epitope along with two conserved glycans (47). they were isolated from chronically infected individuals. it is not clear whether findings from infected humans can be directly translated into vaccines designed to be tested in a healthy uninfected human population. a panel of CD4bs-directed macaque MAbs elicited by an Env vaccine was identified (49) but the high cost of NHP studies prevents the wide adoption of this system. newly developed humanized mice models are making progress in HIV infection studies, including the analysis of T cell responses. rabbits rearranged the same VH gene, VH1, which encodes the VHa allotypic sequence. rabbits preferentially use it to produce functional antibodies (55) the rabbit humoral system can serve as a simplified testing platform to study evolution pathway of antibody genes. three of 12 RMAbs cloned in this pilot study showed positive neutralizing activities. three of 12 RMAbs cloned in this pilot study showed positive neutralizing activities. the third neutralizing MAb, R53, was the only one in this pilot study that was able to bind all five antigens from subtype A to subtype E. RMAbs were first screened by conventional ELISA against recombinant monomer gp120 antigens. not all gp120-positive hybridomas from the initial screening were further cloned, which reduced the understanding of the full spectrum of gp120-specific RMAbs. the new RMAb platform will provide a useful tool to achieve such goals. it is possible that the observed high degree of somatic mutations is due to the multiple immunizations at the end."}
