{"summary": "the risk of progressing to DHF is greater during secondary compared to primary infection. antibodies have been demonstrated to enhance DENV in cell culture [5], [6] and in animal models of dengue pathogenesis [7]\u2013[9]. humans develop antibodies that cross-react with all 4 serotypes. but mainly neutralize the homologous serotype responsible for the infection. studies with human immune sera and human monoclonal antibodies have demonstrated that the dominant antibody response is cross-reactive. the protocol for recruiting and collecting blood samples from people was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. human immune sera or hMAbs serially diluted in blocking buffer were added for 1 hr at 37\u00b0C followed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (Sigma) for 1 hr at 37\u00b0C. cells producing DENV specific antibody were identified by screening culture supernatants by flow cytometry. epitope mapping of EDIII binding hMAbs DENV antibody escape mutant viruses were selected for by infecting vero cells with DENV2 (strain S-16803) in the presence of hMAb concentrations estimated to neutralize greater than 99% of infectious virus. the recombinant proteins bind to conformational MAbs and X-ray crystallography studies have demonstrated that these proteins retained a native-like structure [12], [13]. recombinant proteins bind to conformational MAbs and X-ray crystallography studies have demonstrated that these proteins retained a native-like structure. the dengue neutralization profiles confirmed previous primary DENV2 (Donor 013) and DENV3 (Donor 033) infections. from both donor hMAbs were produced as previously described. a high fever following a visit to india in 2005 confirmed a primary DENV3 infection. a year later, when serum and PBMCs were isolated, the subject had a neutralizing antibody response that primarily targeted DENV3 (Table S1). Initially we characterized the binding properties of serum polyclonal antibodies in both subjects using purified DENVs and recombinant DENV E proteins from the 4 serotypes. end point binding titers are based on ELISAs performed with virus or recombinant E (rE) protein antigen and serial dilutions of immune serum. the end point binding titers were the reciprocal of the highest dilution that produced a signal 2 standard deviations above the signal for normal human sera. a primary screen was conducted using C6/36 cells infected with the homologous serotype. c Proportion of recombinant E (rE) protein reactive cultures was determined by ELISA using recombinant protein from homologous virus. hMAb DV64.31, which had also recognized E protein, bound to rE protein from all 4 DENV serotypes. only hMAb DV64.31, which had also recognized E protein by Western Blot, bound to rE protein from all 4 DENV serotypes. all 16 hMAbs from donor 033 showed strong type-specific neutralization of DENV3. the 50% neutralization titers against DENV3 were determined for all 16 hMAbs from donor 033 using a flow cytometry based neutralization test. hMAbs from donor 013 were cross-reactive, weakly neutralizing and directed to antigens other than rE. hMAbs from donor 013 displayed variable neutralization properties. hMAbs from donor 013 displayed variable neutralization properties. the strongly neutralizing hMAbs, including those that were cross-reactive in binding assays, neutralized DENV2 better than the other serotypes. hMAbs from donor 013 were tested for binding dengue virus, recombinant E (rE) and EDIII from DENV2. Cross-reactivity was determined by using whole virus antigen from all four serotypes. the virus passed in the presence of hMAb DV10.16 acquired the point mutation E311K. this amino acid is located on the A strand of EDIII and forms part of a dengue subcomplex epitope recognized by neutralizing mouse MAbs [18], [23]. d DENV2 escape mutants were obtained with strongly neutralizing MAbs only. e EDIII mutations that led to a complete loss of binding and partial loss of binding are indicated separately. PBMCs were isolated and IgG+ memory B cells were immortalized with EBV and CpG as previously described. the immortalized B cell culture supernatants were screened for antibodies that bound to C6/36 insect cells infected with DENV3. all the hybridomas produced IgG1 with the single exception DV20.10, which was IgG3 (Table S2). 13 hMAbs cross-reacted with all four dengue serotypes dengue complex reactiveand one antibody bound to serotypes 1 and 3, but not 2 and 4 (dengue sub complex reactive) 4G2 and 2H2 are control mouse MAbs that bind E and prM proteins. the remaining antibodies ranged from weak to moderately neutralizing. the neutralizing antibodies had similar 50% neutralization titers against all 4 serotypes. hMAbs for which a specific antigen has still not been identified are designated with a *\"*. prM antibodies have shallow neutralization curves, which plateau when 60% of the virions are neutralized. we characterized the dengue specific memory B cell response in donor 013. 10 hMAbs from donor 013 were tested for binding dengue virus. 5 hMAbs were DENV2 type-specific, 2 hMAbs were dengue subcomplex-specific and 3 hMAbs were dengue complex-specific. hMAbs from donor 013 displayed variable neutralization properties. two approaches were used to map binding sites of hMAbs on EDIII. two strongly neutralizing hMAbs that bound EDIII were mapped. the virus passaged in the presence of hMAb DV3.7 acquired the single point mutation V382G. 2 type specific Strong V382G P384A, P384N K307Q DIII-lateral DV14.21 DENV2 type specific Weak NA K305E, K307N, K307I, K310E G304Y K307Q DIII-A strand DV21.5 DENV subcomplex None NA K305E, K310E, K317Y NA DIII-A strand NA = Not Applicable a Only EDIII reactive MAb strain 16681) using residues identified by neutralization escape selection (blue) or yeast surface display screening (orange). 3.7 and 25.5 are type-specific antibodies that bind to epitopes centered on the lateral ridge while 10.16 is sub-complex-specific and bind to an epitope centered on the A strand of EDIII. many hMAbs that bound to deNV particles did not bind to rE protein. some antibodies may recognize E protein epitopes only available in the context of the native oligomeric array on the virion. the abundance of hMABs reflects the functional properties of antibodies in immune sera. a small fraction of deNV-specific antibodies in immune sera are responsible for neutralization. further studies are needed to understand how the properties of hMABs from DENV immune donors relate to the properties of circulating serum antibody. a majority of the deNV-specific human antibodies were broadly cross-reactive. only a minor fraction of the total dengue specific antibody response was responsible for potent neutralization of the homologous virus."}
