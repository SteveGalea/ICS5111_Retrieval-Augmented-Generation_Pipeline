{"summary": "a prospective observational study examined the impact of rapid viral test results on antimicrobial prescriptions and clinical outcomes among hospitalized adults. results Influenza virus was identified in 53% of individuals in the study population, and other viruses were identified in 10%. public health agency of canada/canadian Institutes of Health Research Influenza Research Network screened potential study participants. subjects excluded if they were tested for respiratory viruses >7 days after onset of symptoms. subjects excluded if they were tested for respiratory viruses. RVP assay developed at the MUHC was validated as having lower limits of detection for all viruses, compared with those for direct fluorescent antibody and culture. results were faxed to the ward and immediately available electronically on the hospital laboratory information system. the only antiviral used in our institution for treatment of influenza was oseltamivir. the only antiviral used in our institution for treatment of influenza was oseltamivir. the only antiviral used in our institution was oseltamivir. we calculated a confidence interval by using the Wilson method. to study the impact of the RVP finding on the outcome measures, we stratified patients by whether they began treatment before testing. for each of the 3 categories of findings yielded by the RVP, we calculated the percentage of patients who discontinued antimicrobial treatment after testing. surveillance network of the public health agency of Canada/Canadian Institutes of Health Research Influenza Research Network screened patients who were hospitalized for potential enrollment. subjects excluded if they were tested for respiratory viruses >7 days after onset of symptoms. radiographic suspicion (by any physician) of pneumonia at the time of admission. the principal investigator (M. S.) reviewed all data and an external auditor monitored data quality yearly. the testing panel targeted influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV A and B), parainfluenza virus 1\u20133, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, and coronavirus OC43 and 229E. the only antiviral used in our institution for treatment of influenza was oseltamivir. our main objective was to evaluate whether rapid availability of RVP results had an impact on antimicrobial use in hospital. we distinguished between patients who were treated before testing and those who were not. to study the impact of the RVP finding on the outcome measures, we stratified patients by whether they began treatment before testing. we calculated the percentage of patients who discontinued antimicrobial treatment for each of the 3 categories defined by the RVP result. results for antiviral and antibiotic treatments were analyzed separately. cPatients who were treated after RVP findings were available (all started treatment 1 day after specimen collection for RVP testing) over the 3 winters, 425 study patients (53%) had influenza virus\u2013positive results (342 tested positive for influenza A virus, 83 tested positive for influenza B virus), and 81 (10%) had other virus\u2013positive results. y Mean SD 70.1 18.0 71.2 18.2 67.6 15.5 69.2 18.3 Median 73.0 76.0 67.0 72.0 Charlson index Mean SD 2.9 2.5 2.7 2.4 3.0 2.5 3.2 2.7 Median 2.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 Frailty scale Mean SD 5.15 1.9 5.6 2.0 4.2 1.6 4.6 1.8 Median 5.0 6.0 4.0 5.0 Length of stay, d Mean SD 13.4 16.4 12.4 1 0.0) 17 (77.3) Directly related to infection 25 (39.1) 23 (59.0) 1 (33.3) 1 (4.6) Indirectly related to infection 16 (25.0) 11 (28.2) 1 (33.3) 4 (18.2) Missing cause 1 (0.2) 0 (0.0) 1 (33.3) 0 Complication Yes 324 (40.5) 172 (40.5) 22 (31.9) 130 (42.5) No 448 (56.0) 235 (55.3) 44 (63.8) 169 (55.2 Characteristics of Empirically Treated Versus Non-Empirically Treated Patients Variable Treated Empirically (n = 464) Not Treated Empirically (n = 336) Age, y Mean SD 71.1 17.1 68.7 19.3 Median 75.0 72.0 Charlson index Mean SD 2.8 2.4 3.1 2.7 Median 2.0 2.0 Frailty scale Mean SD 5.1 2.0 5.1 1.7 Median 5.0 5.0 Length of stay, d Mean SD oseltamivir was discontinued in 15 with and 9 without a suspicion of pneumonia. renal failure was cited as the reason for discontinuation in 7 cases. discontinuing oseltamivir after availability of RVP findings was significantly less likely in the influenza virus\u2013positive group as compared to the influenza virus\u2013negative group. data are no. or no.
