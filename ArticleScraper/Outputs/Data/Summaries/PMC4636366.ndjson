{"summary": "human coronaviruses (HCoV) are enveloped positive-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the family Coronaviridae in the order Nidovirales. they have also been associated with other more serious human pathologies, such as pneumonia and bronchiolitis, and even meningitis [2\u20134] in more vulnerable populations. characterization led to the identification of predominant mutations, including one at the amino acid Gly758, which introduces a putative furin-like protease cleavage site RRSRR758 in the viral S protein [16]. the sequences of more than 60 clinical isolates reveal a common G758R resulting from a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the viral S gene. rOC/ATCC and rOC/SG758R variants are neuroinvasive and neurovirulent. we first investigated the potential biological function of the viral G758R mutation located in the HCoV-OC43 S gene between the S1 and S2 domains. rOC/ATCC and rOC/SG758R variants are neuroinvasive and neurovirulent. mutant virus showed a delay in body weight gain of about 50% at 9 days post-infection compared to control mice. both variants rOC/ATCC and rOC/SG758R are neuroinvasive and neurovirulent in 10 day-old BALB/c mice infected by the intranasal route. viral antigens were already present everywhere in the olfactory bulb infected by the reference wild-type virus. at 7 dpi, the kinetics was restored as the mutant infected this region as efficiently as the reference virus. no viral antigens were detected in this region for the mutant virus at 7 dpi. mice infected with 103.25 TCID50/10L of rOC/ATCC or rOC/SG758R or PBS by the IN route. rOC/ATCC is more neurovirulent in 21 day-old female mice inoculated by intracerebral. differences were expressed in % during 21 day post-infection. differences were significant (*** P0.001) when the three conditions were compared between 9 and 11 dpi. virus developed encephalitis associated with the 4 different levels of clinical scores. survival and weight curves coupled with the clinical scores indicate that the mutant virus was less neurovirulent than reference virus after intracerebral inoculation in 21-day-old female mice. a slight increase in astrocytes in the olfactory bulb (S2A Fig) and in the hippocampus (S2D Fig) could be observed in brains of mice infected by reference virus compared to the mutant virus. a delay in viral spread in neurons for the mutant virus at 8 and 24 hpi compared to the reference strain rOC/ATCC. a significant increase in infectious virus in the cell culture supernatant (free virus) between 48 and 72 hpi for the mutant virus compared to the reference virus rOC/ATCC. viral replication was similar to that observed between both viruses in murine primary cells. the cleavage of the S protein into S1/S2 fragments was again predominant in the cell culture supernatant. cultures from BALB/c mice brain were infected with rOC/ATCC or rOC/SG758R at MOI 0.03. release of free virus in the supernatant was significantly higher for rOC/SG758R compared to rOC/ATCC (* P0.05) western blot analysis of whole cell lysates (C) or cell culture supernatant (D) (10 g of proteins) revealed the presence of the uncleaved form of proprotein convertases (PCs) are proteases that potentially cleave the HCoV-OC43 S glycoprotein at the putative furin-like cleavage site. proprotein convertases (PCs) are proteases that potentially cleave the HCoV-OC43 S glycoprotein at the putative furin-like cleavage site. supernatants were harvested over a period of 48 hpi. a synthetic peptide containing the sequence of reference virus (RRSRG) was only cleaved by furin after 15 hours. furin-like inhibitor reduced the cleavage of the S protein. Fig 9A represents the first type of morphology, which we named \u201clong\u201d for long S peplomers as measurements of the spike (S) and the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) peplomer. the same relative length of S and HE proteins were previously determined for other coronaviruses [28]. mixed primary cultures from BALB/c mice brain were infected with rOC/ATCC or rOC/SG758R at MOI 0.03 and supernatants were harvested at 48 hpi. after negative staining by PTA, viral particles were observed. no significant differences were found in the ratio of infectious viral particles over total viral particles. the amount of viral RNA associated with infected LA-N-5 cells remained the same over a period of 16 hours. rOC/ATCC and rOC/SG758R variants are neuroinvasive and neurovirulent. mice infected with mutant virus showed a delay in body weight gain of about 50% at 9 days post-infection compared to control mice. rOC/ATCC and rOC/SG758R are neuroinvasive and neurovirulent in 10 day-old BALB/c mice infected by the intranasal route. the difference in neurovirulence between the two viruses did not correlate with a different amount in production of infectious viral particles in the CNS (brain and spinal cord) the difference in neurovirulence between the two viruses did not correlate with a different amount in production of infectious viral particles in the CNS (brain and spinal cord) rOC/SG758R -infected mice infected with 103.25 TCID50/10L of rOC/ATCC or rOC/SG758R, or PBS by the IN route. rOC/ATCC is more neurovirulent in 21 day-old baLB/c female mice inoculated by the intracerebral route. BALB/c mice received 102.5 TCID50/10L of rOC/ATCC or rOC/SG758R or PBS by the IC route. differences were significant (*** P0.001) when the three conditions were compared between 9 and 11 dpi. the only clinical sign caused by mutant virus was the abnormal flexion of the four limbs (level 1). no clinical signs were noted for sham mice. mutant virus was less neurovirulent than reference virus after IC inoculation in 21-day old mice. no viral antigens were detected before 7 dpi for the mutant virus. no viral antigens were detected before 7 dpi for the mutant virus. a slight increase in the number of astrocytes in the olfactory bulb and in the hippocampus. we first evaluated the kinetics of viral replication and spread within mixed primary CNS cultures from BALB/c mice over a period of 72 h post-infection (hpi). a delay in viral spread in neurons for the mutant virus at 8 and 24 hpi compared to the reference strain rOC/ATCC. the cleavage of the S protein into S1/S2 fragments was predominantly detected in the cell culture supernatant (Fig 7A and 7B) the cleavage was more evident for mutant than for reference virus. similar results were obtained with HRT-18 cells. mixed primary cultures from BALB/c mice brain were infected with rOC/ATCC or rOC/SG758R at MOI 0.03. release of free virus in the supernatant was significantly higher for rOC/SG758R compared to rOC/ATCC (* P0.05). proprotein convertases (PCs) are proteases that potentially cleave the HCoV-OC43 S glycoprotein at the putative furin-like cleavage site. differentiated human neuroblastoma cell line (LA-N-5) was incubated before and after infection with different concentration of furin-like inhibitor. infection was performed with rOC/ATCC or rOC/SG758R at MOI 0.1. furin-like inhibitor decanoylated furin-like inhibitor (dec-RVKR-cmk) cleavage of the S protein of mutant virus was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by dec-RVKR-cmk. supernatants were harvested over a period of 48 hpi. a synthetic peptide containing the sequence of reference virus (RRSRR) was only cleaved in 30\u201360 minutes the typical coronavirus double crown-shape of the HCoV-OC43 virion was present in two different forms in cell supernatants harvested at 48 hpi during infection of mixed primary CNS cultures. Fig 9A represents the first type of morphology, which we named \u201clong\u201d for long S peplomers as measurements of the spike (S) and the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) peplomer. observation of virus crown peplomers was made by Transmission Electron Microscopy. mixed primary cultures from BALB/c mice brain were infected with rOC/ATCC or rOC/SG758R at MOI 0.03 and supernatants were harvested at 48 hpi. after negative staining by PTA, viral particles were observed. a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) naturally found in the S gene of all known HCoV-OC43 contemporary clinical isolates leads to a G758R mutation in the S protein. this mutation was sufficient to modify viral spread and neurovirulence in susceptible mice by modulating the cleavage of the S protein. however, we were not able to detect any viral presence in the respiratory tract of infected mice. rOC/SG758R retains its neuroinvasive properties even though there was a delay in viral spread and in the production of infectious virus. this phenomenon may explain the mutant reduced neurovirulence accompanied by less severe neurological symptoms and a less frequent spread to the spinal cord. astrogliosis and microgliosis observed after infection may also be related to a faster spread throughout the CNS compared to the mutant virus. cleavage of HCoV-OC43 S glycoprotein also has an impact on pathology, as it decreases neurovirulence and spread within the CNS. cleavage of HCoV-OC43 S glycoprotein also has an impact on pathology, as it decreases neurovirulence. the ratio of uncleaved S protein over S1/S2 cleaved form increased for mutant virus rOC/ATCC in a dose-dependent manner. the synthetic peptide harboring the G758R mutation was cleaved with much more efficiency by PCs than the model peptide mimicking the reference virus S protein. however, even though furin represented the most efficient convertase, PC5/6 and PACE4 were also able to cleave the synthetic rOC/SG758R HCoV-OC43 cleavage was shown to influence viral entry for IBV [47]. modified virion morphology associated with preferential cleavage of HCoV-OC43 variant S protein at the S1/S2 domain interface correlate with a decrease CNS viral spread and neurovirulence in susceptible mice. HCoV-OC43 was never able to induce syncytia in any type of cells we studied. the influence of spike cleavage on coronavirus propagation is not an absolute prerequisite. further studies are warranted to characterize the mechanisms associated with HCoV-OC43 spread within the CNS. HCoV-OC43 is clearly able to infect neuronal cells and to spread with or without the need for a furin-like S protein cleavage. this is of importance to better understand the mechanisms underlying viral spread within the CNS, potentially associated with an adaptation of HCoV-OC43 to this particular environment. HCoVs are naturally neuroinvasive in both mice and humans. understanding mechanisms and consequences of virus interactions with the nervous system is essential to better understand potentially pathologically relevant consequences. animal experiments approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Ethics Committee (INRS) the HRT-18 cell line was cultured in minimal essential medium alpha (MEM-alpha;
