{"summary": "primary antiviral CD8 T cell immunity is elicited prior to production of neutralizing antibodies. humoral responses provide a first line of defense against secondary infection. reactivation of CD8 T cell memory is vital to control viruses escaping neutralizing Ab due to genetic variation. the central nervous system (CNS) constitutes an exceptionally challenging environment for T cells to exert antiviral functions. these include limited T cell access due to the blood brain barrier, limited numbers and location of antigen-presenting cells, and little production of c-dependent cytokines supporting T cell activity and survival. early CD4 T cell help prevents partial CD8 T cell exhaustion and promotes maintenance of herpes simplex virus 1 latency in sensory ganglia (11) oligodendrocytes and astrocytes express MHC class II molecules during viral encephalitis. CD4 help contributes to but is not absolutely required for CD8 T cell effector function and survival in the CNS. recipients were depleted of CD4 T cells by intraperitoneal injection with 250 g of anti-CD4 (-CD4) monoclonal Ab (MAb) GK1.5 either at 2, 0, and 2 days p.i. during initial T cell activation, at 4 and 6 days p.i. during initial T cell activation, at 7 and 9 days p.i. recombinant cytokine standard (BD Bioscience) was detected after 2 h of incubation at room temperature. bound IFN- was detected using biotinylated -IFN- Ab (XMG1.2; BD Bioscience) and avidin peroxidase followed by 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032 tetramethylbenzidine. cells were recovered from the 30%-70% interface, washed once, and resuspended in fluorescence-activated cell sorter buffer (PBS with 0.5% bovine serum albumin [BSA]) cells were homogenized in RPMI containing collagenase (1 mg/ml; Roche, Indianapolis, IN) and DNase I (1 mg/ml; Roche) Virus-specific CD8 T cells were identified using Db/S510 MHC class I tetramers (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA) for 30 min on ice. Stained cells were washed twice with FACS buffer and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde. a minimum of 5 104 cells were collected per pooled sample and frozen in 400 l TRIzol (invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at 80\u00b0C for subsequent RNA extraction and PCR analysis. Virus specific IFN- production by CLN-derived CD8 T cells was evaluated after peptide stimulation. sections were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, treated with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS at room temperature, blocked for 30 min, and stained with rabbit -mouse laminin Ab. the samples were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. PCR conditions were 10 min at 95\u00b0C followed by 40 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 15 s, 60\u00b0C for 30 s and 72\u00b0C for 30 s. previously described primers were used for transcripts encoding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), interleukin-10 (IL-10), CCL2, CCL5, CXCL9, CXCL10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and IL APDH, IL-2, IFN-, IgG, kappa-light chain and perforin mRNA levels were determined using Applied Biosystems gene expression arrays. PCR conditions were 20 s at 95\u00b0C followed by 40 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 3 s and 60\u00b0C for 30 s. a P value of 0.05 was considered significant. all procedures were conducted in accordance with animal protocols approved by the Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. titers within the brain were determined from clarified supernatants by plaque assay using the murine delayed brain tumor (DBT) astrocytoma. dilutions of serum from individual mice (n = 3 to 5) were incubated with 50 PFU of JHMV in 96-well plates for 90 min at 37\u00b0C. DBT cells (8 104 cells/well) were then added, and plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 48 h. cords were homogenized in RPMI containing collagenase (1 mg/ml; Roche, Indianapolis, IN) and DNase I (1 mg/ml; Roche), using a gentleMACS dissociator. cells were centrifuged at 450 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. mononuclear cells were separated by a Percoll gradient. for cell surface markers prior to permeabilization with Cytofix/Cytoperm reagent (BD Bioscience) and staining with allophycocyanin-labeled -granzyme B Ab (GB12, isotype-control mouse IgG1; Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for detection of Annexin-V, cells were stained with -CD8 Ab and -CD45 Ab. after fixation with 0.4% paraformalde 2 106 CLN cells were cultured in absence or presence of 1 M S510 peptide. cells were stained for surface expression of CD8, CD44, and CD62L. cells were then permeabilized to detect intracellular IFN-. Alexa fluor 594 goat -rabbit (Invitrogen) and Alexa Flour 488 goat -rat (Invitrogen) Ab were added. sections were mounted with ProLong Gold antifade reagent with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and analyzed using a Leica DM2500 microscope. cDNA was synthesized from RNA using oligo(dT) primers. PCR conditions were 20 s at 95\u00b0C followed by 40 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 3 s and 60\u00b0C for 30 s. transcript levels were calculated relative to the GAPDH housekeeping gene. CT represents the threshold cycle at which the fluorescent signal becomes significantly higher than that of the background. results are expressed as the means standard errors of the means (SEM) for each group of mice. RESULTS CD4 T cells regulate initial priming of CD8 T cells. early but not delayed CD4 T cell depletion affects priming and expansion of peripheral nave CD8 T cells. CD4 T cell depleted either at 2, 0, and +2 days p.i. (A) or at 4 and 6 days p.i. (B) T cell-depleted mice showed an overall reduction in acute clinical symptoms. mortality increased between days 21 and 24 p.i. to assess if mortality was associated with impaired viral control in the CNS. viral loads in the brain and spinal cord were monitored. -CD4 MAb treatment prevents CD4 T cell accumulation in the CNS. mice were treated with -CD4 or control MAb at 4 and 6 days p.i. transcript levels are relative to GAPDH. differences in overall clinical score up to day 14 p.i. between control and CD4 T cell-depleted mice were determined by unpaired t test. notably, T cell function is critical to reduce viral titers to undetectable levels by day 14 p.i. impaired CD8 T cell recruitment into the CNS is independent of CD4 T cell help. increased CD4 T cell accumulation relative to that of CD8 T cells in the CNS during early JHMV infection (45) may promote inflammatory responses via IFN- production. this suggests that CD4 T cells can affect CNS inflammation at multiple levels. infected mice were treated with -CD4 or control MAb at 4 and 6 days p.i. pletion reduces chemokine production in the CNS. data are expressed as the mean transcript levels SEM relative to GAPDH mRNA. control virus replication, despite early CD4 T cell help, could not be attributed to impaired peripheral expansion or altered CNS accumulation of virus-specific CD8 T cells. CNS inflammation was analyzed by flow cytometry from pooled tissues of 3 mice. impaired viral control at day 10 p.i. indicated an expedited decline in CD8 T cell function in the absence of CNS CD4 T cells. granzyme B was expressed by a smaller percentage of CNS-derived CD8 T cells. levels at day 7 p.i. were lower in CD4 T cell-depleted mice than in controls. pooled brain cells (n 4/group) isolated at days 7 and 10 p.i. were stained for CD45 and MHC class II. density plots depict staining with -CD45 and MHC class II. CD8 T cells were purified from the infected CNS at days 7 and 10 p.i. levels of IFN- transcripts were indeed 2- to 3-fold lower in CD8 T cells from CD4 T cell-depleted mice. transcript levels of perforin were also reduced 2.3-fold at day 10 p.i. transcript levels of IFN- (A), perforin (B), IL-10 (C), TNF (D), IL-2 (E) and TRAIL (F) were assessed by real-time PCR. depletion of CD4 T cells prior to infection with lethal JHMV increased the frequency of apoptotic cells in the CNS. mice were treated with -CD4 or control MAb at 4 and 6 days p.i. brain cells from individual mice (n = 3 to 4) were stained for CD8, Annexin-V+ (A) or Ki-67+ (B) CD8 T cells are shown. infected control mice were treated with -CD4 or control MAb at 4 and 6 days p.i. IL-7 transcripts were sustained at elevated levels throughout day 14 p.i. IL-2 expression suggests that CD8 T cell-derived autonomous IL-2 and increased IL-15 may support ongoing CD8 T cell proliferation. CD4 T cells in the CNS were not depleted until day 7 p.i. total numbers of CD45hi CNS-infiltrating cells were slightly decreased at day 10 p.i. after CD4 depletion at days 7 and 9 p.i. CD8 T cells purified from the infected CNS at day 10 p.i. showed IFN-, perforin, and IL-10 mRNA levels similar to those for CD8 T cells from undepleted infected mice. depletion of CD4 T cells subsequent to T cell infiltration restores viral control and CD8 T cell effector function. the absence of CD4 T cells reduced virus-specific CD8 T cells in the CLN 7- to 8-fold at days 5 and 7 p.i.. expansion of virus-specific CD8 T cells in CLN was delayed until day 4 p.i. CD4 T cells are detected in the CNS as early as day 5 p.i. and peak at approximately day 10 p.i. (45). CD8 T cells reach maximum levels at approximately day 7 p.i. (45). this regimen resulted in >99% depletion of CD4 T cells. viral titers in the CNS at day 14 p.i. were 2 log10 higher than those of the controls. in both groups, the majority of virus-infected cells exhibited morphology consistent with oligodendrocytes, the predominant cell type infected in immunocompetent mice. Percentages of CD4+ T cells within the CLN (boxed cells) are shown below the ellipse. data are representative of results of three independent experiments. T cell function is critical to reduce viral titers to undetectable levels by day 14 p.i., independent of humoral responses. however, local Ab production by invading B cells is required to maintain persisting virus at levels detectable only by PCR (24, 41, 42). CD4 T cells also enhance monocyte recruitment during early JHMV infection (22), suggesting that CD4 T cells can affect CNS inflammation at multiple levels. all proinflammatory chemokines, with exception of CCL3, were reduced by at least 50%. total numbers of CD45hi CNS-infiltrating cells were slightly lower in CD4 T cell-depleted mice than in control mice at day 7 p.i. notably, the number of infiltrating CD45hi F4/80+ macrophages was diminished by 45% in CD4 T cell-depleted mice. the data are expressed as the means SEM from two independent experiments with at least 3 mice per time point per experiment. the absence of CNS CD4 T cells compromises CD8 T cell effector function and survival. the absence of functional CD4 T cells compromises CD8 T cell effector function during many chronic infections associated with elevated viral Ag load. pooled brain cells (n 4/group) isolated at days 7 and 10 p.i. were stained for CD8, TCR and intracellular granzyme B. Mean fluorescence intensity of granzyme B staining in CD8 T cells is shown in parentheses. IFN- secreted by both CD8 and CD4 T cells within the CD45lo microglia of both experiments. levels of IFN- transcripts were indeed 2- to 3-fold lower in CD8 T cells from CD4 T cell-depleted mice. levels of IFN- transcripts were also reduced 2.3-fold at day 10 p.i. IL-10 transcripts were decreased 3-fold in CD8 T cells from CD4 T cell-depleted mice. decreased effector function of CD8 T cells in the absence of CD4 T cells is not global. CD4 T cells from infected control mice contained 5% Annexin-V-positive (Annexin-V+) cells at day 10 p.i.. the percentage of Annexin-V+ CD8 T cells increased 2.5-fold in the absence of CD4 T cells. IL-2, IL-7, IL-21, and IL-15 are not produced by T cells. absence of CNS CD4 T cells did not alter IL-2 mRNA levels. however, by days 10 and 14 p.i., levels were comparable to those for controls. efficient CD8 T cell recruitment but impaired function within the CNS imply that CD4 T cell help acts at the site of infection. depletion of CD4 T cells following CNS infiltration rescues viral control and CD8 T cell effector function. 5.6 1.2 104 per control mouse brain versus 2.6 0.3 104 per depleted mouse brain. partial reduction of CD4 T cells in the CNS suggested that the remaining CD4 T cells were derived from cells infiltrating prior to day 7 p.i. Alternatively, MAb depleted only a subset of CD4 T cells, most likely those within the perivascular space. pooled brain cells (n 4/group) isolated at day 10 p.i. were stained for CD8 and intracellular granzyme B. Mean fluorescence intensity of granzyme B staining in CD8 T cells is shown. chemokine production triggered by Ag-specific DC-CD4 T cell interactions may further contribute by attracting nave CD8 T cells to competent DC (5). effective rescue of primary virus-specific CD8 T cell expansion by delayed CD4 T cell depletion at day 4 p.i. supports the notion that early signals arising from DC-helper T cell interactions are critical. sufficient to recruit CD8 T cells into the CNS parenchyma, excluding impaired trafficking as the cause of diminished virus control. CD8 T cells control JHMV replication in MHC class I-expressing glia via both perforin- and IFN-mediated activities. decreased granzyme B protein as well as IFN- and perforin mRNA levels in CNS-derived CD8 T cells from CD4 T cell-depleted mice. IL-21 is known to support CD8 T cell survival and functionality during viral infection. purified CD8 T cells from the CNS of CD4 T cell-depleted mice had slightly higher transcript levels of TRAIL than those of controls. TRAIL mRNA levels were equivalent in purified CD8 T cells when CD4 T cell depletion was initiated at day 7 p.i., subsequent to CNS T cell infiltration."}
