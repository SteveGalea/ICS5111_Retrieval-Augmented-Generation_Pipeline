{"summary": "acute respiratory illnesses in children in sub-saharan africa have received relatively little attention. underlying diseases such as AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis can worsen such illnesses. the burden of influenza and influenza-like illness in africa was considered negligible. report from Cameroon and Senegal shows that influenza viruses are actively circulating and may be causing regular epidemics [7,8] a clear picture of the contribution of each pathogen to acute respiratory illness is needed to improve prevention and clinical management. the dry season is December\u2013May (yellow line), and the rainy season is June\u2013November (green line). RNA was extracted with a QIAmp RNA mini kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. influenza A viruses were detected with a previously described assay targeting the conserved matrix gene. viruses, HRSV, human metapneumovirus and PIV-3 are of order of magnitude of 10 copies/L. for PIV-4, the assay limit of detection is of order of magnitude of 100 copies/L. for PIV-1 and 2, 1000 copies/L, and for PIV-1 and 2, 1000 copies/L. /73 (17.8) 1-2y 123 2/123 (1.6) 2/123 (1.6) 1/123 (0.8) 2/123 (1.6) 8/123 (6.5) 15/123 (12.2) 2-5y 49 2/49 (4.0) 2/49 (4.0) 0/49 1/49 (2.0) 3/49 (8.3) 6-15y 23 1/23 (4.3) 1/23 (4.3) 0/23 0/23 0/23 2/23 (8.6) influenza B virus was implicated in respiratory infections throughout the year, with two peaks: a first (11 positive samples) at the beginning of the rainy season and a second (8 positive samples) in November at the end of the rainy season. partial genome analysis of nine amplified samples showed high nucleotide similarity (98%) to vaccine strain B/Victoria/02/1987. all four cases detected were indigenous, with no history of travel or contact with a person returning from a country with declared cases. extensive investigations of contacts of the confirmed cases did not reveal any other cases, suggesting low dissemination of H1N1pdm09 in the country. most of HRSV cases detected in our study occurred between November and February, corresponding to the dry season in the CAR. the relatively low prevalence of respiratory viruses in the children with ILI was present in only 14.9% of samples. in similar studies, as many as 50% of samples contained respiratory viruses. this will help central africa clinicians to provide better care and treatment for patients presenting with ILI, including better use of antibiotics. further studies with more patients are needed to confirm the burden of viral respiratory diseases in the CAR."}
