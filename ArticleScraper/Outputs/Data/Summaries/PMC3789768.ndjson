{"summary": "plant viruses move from infected cell to neighboring cells during local spread. PDs are tunnels in the cell wall that connect the cytoplasm, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the plasma membrane between adjoining cells. the size exclusion limit of PD is normally too small to allow passive transport of large molecular complexes. microfilaments influence the intracellular or intercellular transport of other MPs or viruses. the secretory pathway is further involved in intra- and intercellular trafficking by several viruses [16], [17], [20], [21], [25], [26]. PD targeting of the tubule-forming MP of cowpea mosaic virus is not affected by either the disruption of ER-Golgi transport or by cytoskeleton disruption. the targeting of CI to PD was shown to be mediated by P3N-PIPO [39], which itself is targeted to the plasma membrane through an interaction with the host protein PCaP1 [32]. this protein induces the production of motile vesicles that contain viral RNA and have been proposed to be the vehicle for intracellular trafficking of potyviral RNA [40], [41]. cDNA coding for 6K2:mCherry was inserted between P1 and HCPro cistrons. cDNA coding for 6K2:mCherry was used to discriminate primary infected cells from secondary infected cells after agroinfiltration. confocal images were formed using the 10 objective by assembly 1212 images in xy. left panel, red fluorescence channel imaging TuMV producing 6K2:mCherry; middle panel, green fluorescence channel imaging GFP-HDEL; and right panel, merged images. same infiltrated area as in D but confocal images were taken at 4, 5 and 6 dpinf. emitted both green and red fluorescence and just a few red-only cells were observed. at the end of the observation period, the surface area of green fluorescence did not change, indicating that GFP-HDEL did not move into neighboring cells. intercellular movement was followed by observing spread of green and red fluorescence for 17 consecutive hours starting at 72 hpinf. replacement of the TuMV cassette with a cassette expressing only 6K2-mCherry did not produce red-only fluorescent foci. results validated the use of the double cassette, GFP-HDEL and TuMV 6K2:mCherry to follow intercellular movement by TuMV. at 4 dpinf, DMSO alone had no inhibitory effect on TuMV movement. on the other hand, BFA and CMA treatment reduced cell-to-cell movement of TuMV. the surface area for mCherry-only expressing foci was measured. surface area of red-only foci was calculated and expressed in fluorescence units. bars represent means and standard errors for 20 replicates per treatment. protein inhibitors were used to further support role of the secretory pathway in intercellular transport. expressing patches confirmed the inhibitory effect of both ARF1(NI) and RAB-E1d(NI) on TuMV intercellular movement. expression of these mutant proteins did not hamper virus protein production in primary infected cells. inhibition of both early and late secretory pathways inhibited TuMV intercellular movement. Tyrphostin A23 inhibits the recruitment of endocytic cargo into clathrin-coated vesicles formed at the plasma membrane by preventing the interaction between the clathrin-binding AP-2 adaptor complex 2 subunit and the sorting motif within the cytoplasmic domain of plasma membrane proteins [49] efaciens Agl1 containing pCambiaTuMV/6K2:mCherry//GFP-HDEL. the drug concentrations used previously were shown to block endocytotic pathway in plants. inhibition of endocytosis of FM4-64 in the presence of Wortmannin was confirmed in our system. vesicles were associated with Ara7 (AtRAB-F2b) and internalized FM4-64. intracellular trafficking of 6K2-tagged vesicles has been shown to be dependent on the secretory pathway and microfilaments [40], [48], [57] left panel shows green fluorescence channel from TuMV producing 6K2:GFP, middle panel red fluorescence channel from FM4-64 labeled vesicles. images were taken at 4 dpinf. the ratio of red to green fluorescence in dual expressing cells was unchanged. the last assertion is in line with the prior observation that latB treatment did not affect the production of TuMV-induced 6K2-tagged perinuclear structures and peripheral vesicles. tobacco rattle virus-mediated virus-induced silencing (TRV-VIGS) was adopted to determine the role of myosins on intercellular movement of TMV, potato virus X (PVX), tomato bushy stunt virus, and turnip vein-clearing virus. we then used TRV-VIGS to silence individual myosin genes before TuMV infection. myosin XI-2 is implicated in TuMV intercellular movement. RT-PCR was used to determine expression ratio of target genes in N. benthamiana infected with indicated TRV silencing constructs. bars represent means and standard errors for 10 replicates per treatment. the experiment was repeated twice for each TRV silencing construct. images of pCambiaTuMV/6K2:mCherry//GFP-HDEL in N. benthamiana leaves were silenced for individual myosin genes (VIII1, VIII-2, XI-2, XI-F) bars represent means and standard errors for 21 replicates per treatment. one-way analysis of variance calculation followed by Tukey's Multiple Comparison Test. cDNA coding for 6K2:mCherry was inserted between P1 and HCPro cistrons. three-dimensional rendering of 35 1 m thick confocal image sections that overlap by 0.5 m showing distribution of TuMV-induced 6K2:mCherry-tagged structures. fluorescence emitted by GFP-HDEL was generally observed at approximately 36 hrs post infiltration (hpinf) and mCherry fluorescence resulting from TuMV replication was detected at approximately 60 hpinf. a similar systemic movement was obtained when more dilute agrobacterium suspensions (e.g. 0.01\u20130.001) were infiltrated. the agroinfiltrated leaf is still attached to the plant on the confocal microscope stage. we first measured the number of leaf epidermal cells for every linear 1 mm in three-week-old plants. we then measured the distance from the agroinfiltrated front to the limit of expansion of the red fluorescence at the end of the observation period. the early secretory pathway embraces the ER\u2013Golgi interface. the Golgi apparatus and the various post-Golgi organelles that control plasma membrane or vacuolar sorting is categorized as the late secretory pathway. we quantified mCherry fluorescence intensity over GFP fluorescence intensity in primary infection foci for all treatments. there was no significant difference in the ratio of red over green fluorescence during BFA and CMA treatments compared with the no inhibitor treatment at 4 dpinf. green fluorescence levels were also similar between DMSO- and BFA- or CMA-treated primary cells indicating that steady state level of GFP was not affected by the treatments. dominant negative mutant of ARF1 [ARF1(NI)] impaired in GTP/GDP binding inhibits the transport of soluble markers from the ER to Golgi. dominant negative mutant RAB-E1d(NI) inhibits trafficking from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane. BFA treatment did not affect the production of TuMV-induced 6K2-tagged perinuclear structures and peripheral vesicles. plasmids pCambiaTuMV/6K2:mCherry//GFP-HDEL alone (A) or with dominant negative mutant ARF1(NI) (B) or with RAB-E1d (NI) (C). Tyrphostin A51 is a structural analog of Tyrphostin A23 but has no inhibitory effect. Wortmannin is a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor that inhibits in mammalian cells receptor sorting. in plant cells, it has been shown that the drug inhibits endocytosis of FM4-64. N. benthamiana leaves were infiltrated with DMSO (A), 20 M Wortmannin (B), 30 M Tyrphostin A51 (C) and 30 M Tyrphostin A23 (D) 4 hours before agroinfiltration with A. tumefaciens containing pCambiaTuMV/6K2:mCherry//GFP-HDEL. a7 fused to pCambiaTuMV/6K2:mCherry in N. benthamiana leaves cells showed no colocalization between Ara7 motile dots and 6K2-tagged vesicles. lack of co-localization of FM4-64 and Ara7 with endocytic markers indicates that endocytic pathways associated with these markers were not important for TuMV cellular spread. RNA viruses may have evolved differently in their requirements for actin and the associated myosin motors [22], [61]. we first tested the effect of LatB and Cytochalasin D (CytD) on the intercellular spread of TuMV. leaves were infiltrated with 5 M LatB, 10 M CytD, or DMSO. images were taken at 4 dpinf. left panel, red fluorescence channel imaging TuMV producing 6K2:mCherry; middle panel, green fluorescence channel imaging GFP-HDEL. bars represent means and standard errors for 20 replicates per treatment. RT-PCR confirmed that the transcriptional level of the target myosin genes was decreased in plants infected by the TRV silencing construct. quantification indicated no significant difference in TuMV intercellular movement in mock- and TRV-infected plants. N. benthamiana leaves silenced for individual myosin genes. pCambiaTuMV/6K2:mCherry//GFP-HDEL used as controls. bars represent means and standard errors for 10 replicates per treatment. expressed N. benthamiana dominant negative myosin mutants for the myosin XI-2 and XI-K. no significant effect was observed for myosin VIII-1 and XI-F. replication was not affected by any dominant-negative myosin mutants. study was able to evaluate the contribution of the secretory pathway and the cytoskeleton for TuMV intercellular movement. we first observed the green fluorescence at 48 hpinf, and mCherry fluorescence at 60 hpinf. this is the time frame normally observed when virus infection is initiated through agroinfiltration. RNA through an amplification system (e.g. RT-PCR) is likely less sensitive and requires maturation of the fluorescent marker [67] after the initial delay in infection, TuMV intercellular movement proceeded at the same rate as infections using purified viral particles. this indicates that the infiltrated agrobacterium did not cause an additional defense response by the plant that significantly impeded spread of TuMV beyond what is normally observed during virus infections. myosin XI-K and myosin XI-2 have been shown to be major facilitators for cellular motility between actin filaments and the ER. XI-K localizes to the motile endomembrane vesicles associated with F-actin. disruption of the early secretory trafficking by BFA inhibited intercellular virus movement of melon necrotic spot virus. disruption of the ER and viral replication equally took place in the presence of BFA [74]. breakdown of actin filaments also did not affect the formation of TuMV 6K2-tagged vesicles. plasmids of interest were agroinfiltrated 24 h before pCambiaTuMV/6K2:mCherry//GFP-HDEL agroinfiltration. leaves were cut and dipped in 1 g/l of FM4-64 (Molecular Probes) pCambiaTuMV/6K2:mCherry//GFP-HDEL agroinfiltration was restricted to a small region in the leaf. vTRV infections were established in N. benthamiana by co-agroinfiltration of pTRV1 and pTRV2 with myosin fragments. leaves above original TRV-inoculated leaf were agroinfiltrated with pCambiaTuMV/6K2mCherry//GFP-HDEL 16 days after TRV infection. leaves were observed 4 days later by confocal microscopy. Graphpad Prism One-way analysis of variance (1 way ANOVA) was used to assess the overall statistical differences between the means of different groups. Tukey's Multiple Comparison Test was also used to assess whether the mean of two particular groups were different from each other. the solution was then diluted to an OD600 of 0.6 for pCambiaTuMV/6K2:mCherry//GFP-HDEL; 0.1 for pARF1(NI), pRAB-E1d(NI) and pYFP-RAB-RAB-F2b; 0.3\u20130.5 for myosin dominant negative mutant. all dominant negative mutants were agroinfiltrated 24 h before pCambia pCambiaTuMV/6K2:mCherry//GFP-HDEL agroinfiltration was restricted to a small region in the leaf. vTRV infections were established in N. benthamiana by co-agroinfiltration of pTRV1 and pTRV2 with myosin fragments. leaves above original TRV-inoculated leaf were agroinfiltrated with pCambiaTuMV/6K2mCherry//GFP-HDEL 16 days after TRV infection. leaves were observed 4 days later by confocal microscopy. single-slice confocal microscope images of N. benthamiana leaf agroinfiltrated 4 days before with A. tumefaciens strain Agl1 containing the above plasmid.
