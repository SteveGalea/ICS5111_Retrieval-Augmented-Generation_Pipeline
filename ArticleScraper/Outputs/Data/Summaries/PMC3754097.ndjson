{"summary": "the order Nidovirales comprises enveloped single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses. it includes the Coronaviridae family, which comprises viruses with the largest known RNA genome (30 kb) (1, 2). these viruses are the causative agents of a variety of human and animal diseases. pathogen-associated molecular pattern mediates activation of antiviral mechanisms leading to protein synthesis shut down. pathway that leads to a block in protein synthesis includes activation of double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), leading to eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2) phosphorylation, and activation of the 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase (2\u2032-5\u2032OAS) and its effect innate immune response must be tightly regulated, since there is only a fine line separating the induction of a protective antiviral response and an exaggerated inflammatory response that can lead to immunopathology (26). many viruses have developed different strategies that counteract the host antiviral responses triggered by dsRNA (27) viral protein antagonizes both IFN production (28) and signaling by inhibiting signal transduction and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) translocation to the nucleus (43). MHV ns2 protein acts as a 2\u2032-5\u2032-phosphodiesterase that reduces the amount of 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylates. TGEV gene 7 is located at the 3\u2032 end of the genome and is the last ORF. all animal samples used in the present study were derived from previously published in vivo experiments (47). the experiments were performed in strict accordance with EU (2010/63/UE) and Spanish guidelines. cRNA preparations (15 g) were fragmented at 94\u00b0C for 35 min. cRNAs (10 g) were hybridized to Genechip Porcine Genome Arrays (Affymetrix) at 45\u00b0C for 16 h. independent microarrays were hybridized for each sample. the total intracellular RNA was extracted at different hours postinfection (hpi) using the RNeasy minikit. cellular gene expression was analyzed using a custom TaqMan assay. the -glucuronidase (GUSB) gene was selected as a reference gene. okine 11 DDX58 (RIG-I) Ss03381552_u1 DEAD box protein 58 GUSB Ss03387751_u1 -Glucuronidase IFNB1 Ss03378485_u1 Interleukin 15 IRF1 Ss03388785_m1 Interferon regulatory factor 1 JAK2 Ss03394066_m1 Janus kinase 2 STAT1 Ss03392296 porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from 8 ml of fresh heparinized venous blood by density gradient centrifugation through a Histopaque-1077 gradient. for restimulation in vitro, PBMCs were cultured (106 cells/well) using RPMI medium supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mM glutamine, 100 M nonessential amino acids, and 100 U of IFNB ELISA kit (Cusabio) according to manufacturer's instructions. representative sections of lung tissue were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. sections (4 m) were deparaffined at 60\u00b0C and rehydrated. cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (4\u2032,6\u2032-diamidino-2-phenylindole [Sigma], 1:200) tissues were mounted in Prolong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen) and analyzed with a confocal fluorescence microscope (TCS SP5; Leica) RNAs were pooled three by three, obtaining three biological replicates for each experimental condition. cDNA was synthesized from 5 g of total RNA using an oligo(dT) primer with a T7 RNA polymerase promoter site added to the 5\u2032 end. in vitro transcription was performed using an oligo(dT) primer. the bioconductor packages \"affy\" and \"limma\" were used for these calculations. the data were acquired with an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system and analyzed with ABI Prism. all experiments and data analysis were MIQE compliant (57). b TaqMan assays were used to measure porcine cellular gene. two- to three-day-old non-colostrum-deprived piglets were inoculated with respiratory tropism recombinant viruses (107 PFU/pig) at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 days postinfection (dpi) two animals per group were sacrificed, and the samples were collected. total RNA was extracted by using an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's instructions. RT-qPCR measurement of viral gRNA and cellular mRNAs was performed. in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 15 min and then blocked with 10% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min. the samples were incubated with a monoclonal antibody that, in porcine lung samples, is specific for macrophages (4E9), a monoclonal antibody that, in porcine samples, is specific for macrophages. 99% of the cells were infected, and no differences in virus titers were observed. a comparison of infected to noninfected cells showed more than 1,500 and 2,500 genes whose expression varied significantly between rTGEV-wt and rTGEV-7 infection. the graphs represent the normalized ratios for rTGEV-wt-infected versus mock-infected cells. dark gray spots indicate upregulated probes (fold change, >2), while medium gray spots indicate downregulated ones (fold change, 2). Only genes with an FDR of 0.05 were considered candidates. the genes included in response to virus gene ontology (GO) group mainly affected the immune response, the IFN response, and inflammation. most of them were significantly upregulated during rTGEV-7 infection compared to that by rTGEV-wt. in general, genes activated during rTGEV-7 infection were also activated during rTGEV-7 infection. RNA was extracted from rTGEV-wt- or rTGEV-7-infected cells at 12 hpi. black bars represent the fold change obtained from microarray data. mRNA levels were used as an endogenous control in all cases. the selection was based on their differential expression levels and porcine TaqMan assay availability. nine candidate genes involved in inflammation and innate immunity were selected for analysis by RT-qPCR. rTGEV-7 virus secreted higher levels of TNF, CCL2 and IFN- compared to rTGEV-wt-infected cells. mRNA accumulation was measured by RT-qPCR, and protein accumulation was measured by ELISA. in vivo expression of proinflammatory cytokines in absence of TGEV protein 7 was greater than that observed in rTGEV-7-infected pigs. rTGEV-7 infection led to increased expression of innate immunity-related genes, in particular of proinflammatory cytokines. PBMCs from rTGEV-wt (black)- or rTGEV-7 (gray)-infected animals were cultured and stimulated with TGEV. at 24 h after stimulation, total RNA was extracted. cytokine mRNA levels were analyzed by RT-qPCR. rTGEV-wt (black)- or rTGEV-7 (gray)-infected animals were collected at 1, 2, and 4 dpi. total RNA was extracted, and the viral gRNA accumulation and cytokine mRNA levels were analyzed by RT-qPCR. at 1 dpi, an increase in granulocytes was observed in both rTGEV-wt- and rTGEV-7-infected tissues. the number of granulocytes seemed to decrease at 4 dpi in both infections. the number of granulocytes seemed to decrease at 4 dpi. rTGEV-7 titers in lung were higher than those of the rTGEV-wt virus at early times postinfection (47) granulocyte recruitment was similar in both wild-type and mutant virus-infected tissues. rTGEV-7-infected tissues showed a significant increase in macrophage recruitment and activation compared to rTGEV-wt-infected tissues. leukocyte signal (immunofluorescence red channel) was estimated in lung sections from infected animals. the positive area for granulocytes (upper panel) or macrophages (lower panel) signal relative to the positive area for TGEV infection (immunofluorescence green channel) signal was calculated using MetaMorph software. 26 and 301 genes were upregulated in rTGEV-wt-infected cells. 84 and 466 genes were downregulated at 6 and 12 h postinfection. more than 60% of the differentially expressed genes at 6 hpi also changed their expression at 12 hpi. numbers on the x axis indicate DAVID FDR values. no probesa Upregulated, fold change > 2, FDR 0.05; downregulated, fold change 2, FDR 0.05. most of the genes were associated with responses against viruses, host defense response, and immune response. RT-qPCR results confirmed the microarray results. a set of nine differentially expressed candidate genes involved in innate immunity was selected to study their expression kinetics by RT-qPCR. no differences in virus titers or viral gRNA accumulation were observed between the parental and mutant viruses. all of the selected candidate genes increased their expression during TGEV-7 infection. in contrast, control genes JAK2 and TGF- were not differentially expressed in the absence or presence of TGEV protein 7. negative controls TGFB1 Controls proliferation, differentiation, and other functions in many cell types. nine candidate genes involved in inflammation and innate immunity were selected for analysis by RT-qPCR. rTGEV-7 infection led to increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines. rTGEV-7 infection led to increased expression of innate immunity-related genes. mRNA accumulation was measured at 16 hpi. TGEV infection of PBMCs was not observed, in contrast to what has been previously described. this cell type represents ca. 0.5% of the cells in a PBMC preparation (64) this cell type represents ca. 0.5% of the cells in a PBMC preparation (64), and pDC enrichment methods are required to detect TNF and type I IFN production. mRNA levels of TNF, CCL2 and CCL5 were higher in rTGEV-7-infected lungs than in rTGEV-wt-infected lungs. rTGEV-7 virus also induced an exacerbated proinflammatory response in vivo. the expression of proinflammatory cytokines during infection could lead to an enhancement of tissue damage due to the activation and recruitment of leukocytes. these activated cells may amplify the damage produced by the pathogen, since they secrete proinflammatory cytokines potentially involved in host-mediated immunopathology. the antibody allowed the simultaneous detection of both activated macrophages and circulating monocytes recruited into the site of infection. other porcine macrophage markers, such as CD163, CD68 and CD172a, were tested. however, the antibodies specific for these markers did not work in paraffin-embedded lung sections. the leukocyte signal (immunofluorescence red channel) was estimated in lung sections from infected animals. rTGEV lacking protein 7 expression was more virulent and caused increased pathology than the parental virus. similar results were obtained in in vivo infections. the presence of protein 7 reduced inflammatory changes after TGEV-7 infection. rTGEV-7 infection caused enhanced cell death, cellular RNA degradation and protein synthesis shutoff. rTGEV-7 infection caused higher lung damage than that caused by rTGEV-wt. in vivo, rTGEV-7 infection caused an increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines. rTGEV-7 infection induced the expression of CD40 receptor (73) MHV infection of rTGEV-7-infected mice causes reduced pathology. coronavirus infection of transgenic mice expressing CCL2 led to enhanced pathology leading to death. similar observations were obtained after influenza virus infection of CCR2/ mice. rTGEV-7 infection caused a \u201ccytokine storm\u201d that led to a progression in lung damage (47). in the absence of protein 7, an increased expression in IFN-, IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and proinflammatory genes was observed. the activity of only around half of these antagonists was demonstrated in the context of viral infection. ation and eIF2 phosphorylation through its binding to PP1 phosphatase (47) have been involved in the IFN response. cells deficient in this enzyme produce lower IFN- amounts than normal cells. PKR has also been involved in the amplification of innate immune response."}
