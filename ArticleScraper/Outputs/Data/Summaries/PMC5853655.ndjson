{"summary": "clinically meaningful endpoints are lacking for hematopoietic cell transplant recipients. subjects were grouped according to presence of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) without lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), URTI progressing to LRTI, and LRTI at presentation. supplemental oxygen\u2013free days were defined as any day while alive after diagnosis of RSV infection. subjects with incomplete data on supplemental oxygen use were excluded. a patient was considered to have RSV LRTI if they had an upper respiratory tract sample that tested positive for RSV. the day of RSV LRTI diagnosis was defined as the date when RSV was detected in the lower respiratory tract specimen. a supplemental oxygen\u2013free day was defined as any 24-hour period during which a subject received 2 L of supplemental oxygen per minute. for definition 1, the day of death and subsequent days up to 28 days following presentation were not considered supplemental oxygen-free days. the impact of death on the number of supplemental oxygen\u2013free days was evaluated using 2 definitions. two-sided P values of.05 were considered statistically significant. all statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 for Windows (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) type Allogeneic/unrelated 171 (74) 101 (71) 42 (78) 28 (85) Autologous 59 (26) 42 (29) 12 (22) 5 (15) No. of transplantations 1 187 (81) 121 (85) 40 (74) 26 (79) 2 40 (17) 21 (15) 14 (26) 5 (15) 3 3 (1) 1 (1) 0 (0) 2 (6) Morphologic relapse No 219 (95) 135 (94) 52 (96) 32 (97) Yes 11 (5) 8 a patient was considered to have RSV URTI if they had an upper respiratory tract sample that tested positive for RSV and no RSV-positive LRTI specimen or radiographic abnormalities. a patient was considered to have RSV URTI if they had an upper respiratory tract sample that tested positive for RSV. the day of RSV LRTI diagnosis was defined as the date when RSV was detected in the lower respiratory tract specimen. after 2007, patients also had RSV detected by reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction analysis. maximum oxygen use per 24-hour period was recorded for days 0 through 28 following initial RSV presentation. if a subject died, none of the 28 days were considered supplemental oxygen\u2013free days. the probability of overall survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. the log-rank test was used to compare mortality curves between groups.

LRTI as a time-dependent risk factor remained significant. LRTI were alive and free of supplemental oxygen use for a median of 16 days less than those in groups 1 and 2 from initial diagnosis. group 2 and 3 patients with possible LRTI had significantly more supplemental oxygen\u2013free days than patients with probable/proven LRTI. deaths were only observed in group 2 and 3 patients with probable or proven LRTI. a conservative increase in the number of supplemental oxygen\u2013free days from 16 to 22 would require 64 subjects per arm. sample size estimates for use of supplemental oxygen\u2013free days as an endpoint in clinical trials of Proven/Probable Respiratory Syncytial Virus. of 87 patients who developed or presented with LRTI, infection in 45 (52%) was defined as possible LRTI. the percentage of subjects using >2 L of supplemental oxygen per minute at diagnosis was found to be highest in those presenting with LRTI (group 3; 48%). in group 3, 6 patients (18%) required mechanical ventilation at diagnosis. the proportion of patients who required any supplementation with >2 L of oxygen per minute by day 28 after diagnosis of RSV infection was lowest for patients who presented with URTI (16% for groups 1 and 2) and highest among those who presented with LRTI (61% for group 3; Table 2). patients presenting with LRTI were more likely to require supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation. ed cumulative incidence curves for time to first use of supplemental oxygen (C) and time to mechanical ventilation (D) were evaluated in univariate modes among all patients from the time of initial diagnosis. only age at transplantation, LRTI (a time-dependent variable), steroid use in the 2 weeks prior to diagnosis of RSV infection, and PCR use as the testing platform were associated with the outcome. the median number of supplemental oxygen\u2013free days after URTI diagnosis for patients in groups 1 and 2 was 29 (IQR, 29\u201329 days); group 3 patients with proven/probable LRTI were alive and free of supplemental oxygen use for a median of 16 days less than those in groups 1 and 2. curves for mortality from the time of LRTI diagnosis are shown in Figure 2A and 2C. no difference was noted in patients with LRTI, whether or not they had progressed from URTI or presented with LRTI. there were no deaths among patients defined as having possible LRTI. a conservative increase in the number of supplemental oxygen\u2013free days from 16 would require 64 subjects per arm. additional sample size calculations for more and less conservative changes in mortality and number of supplemental oxygen\u2013free days are shown in Table 4. mortality and supplemental oxygen\u2013free days are significantly worse in HCT recipients with RSV detected in the lower respiratory tract. death due to any cause only occurred in patients with proven/probable LRTI. mortality rates have been declining, presumably because of changes in transplantation practices. patients with possible LRTI required very little supplemental oxygen and had no deaths. patients with proven/probable LRTI are the only subjects who died and had significantly higher use of supplemental oxygen. supplemental oxygen use correlates with acute lung injury, which is associated with mortality in HCT recipients. our definition of supplemental oxygen\u2013free days is consistent with Schoenfeld\u2019s original definition for ventilator-free days in acute respiratory distress syndrome [23], with 2 notable exceptions. the effect of death was evaluated both with the traditional definition (wherein death at any point during the 28-day period gives a score of 0 supplemental oxygen\u2013free days for that subject) the lowest median number of supplemental oxygen\u2013free days occurred in patients presenting with proven/probable LRTI (13 days), followed by subjects ribavirin is the only antiviral available for specific treatment of RSV disease. cost remains a prohibitive barrier to its use. several antivirals are in phase 2 trials for treatment of RSV infections. the use of BAL to evaluate LRTI is largely based on protocols at our center, which recommend BAL when RSV is detected in the upper respiratory tract and radiographic abnormalities are present. however, the decision to pursue bronchoscopy is ultimately left to the attending physician, and thus some potential probable or proven cases may have been missed. the posted materials are not copyedited and are the sole responsibility of the authors.
