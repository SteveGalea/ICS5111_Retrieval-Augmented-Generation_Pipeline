{"summary": "infants with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) and those with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) have different cytokine profiles in the acute stage. results Of the 88 patients, 38 had an RV infection (RV group) lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which sometimes causes a severe LRTI. some studies have described the importance of the RV in causing an LRTI2,4,5,6) but the data pertaining to the clinical significance of RV infections in infants are inconsistent. the patients with a dual viral infection or infections by metapneumovirus, adenovirus, corona virus, parainfluenza virus, influenza virus, or bocavirus were not included in the analysis. data were collected for the following parameters: age, duration of fever and cough before hospitalization, duration of fever after hospitalization. IFN- (0.4 pg/mL), IL-2 (0.4 pg/mL), IL-4 (4.5 pg/mL), IL-6 (0.4 pg/mL), IL-8 (0.3 pg/mL), IL-13 (0.3 pg/mL), IP-10 (1.2 pg/mL). aturity 7 (18.4) 4 (8.0) RDS 1 (2.6) 2 (4.0) BPD 3 (7.9) 0 (0) Previous respiratory infection 11 (28.9)* 1 (2.0) Present illness Fever history 17 (44.7) 13 (26.0) Hypoxia (oxygen saturation92%) 2 (5.3) 2 (4.0) Rale 21(55.3) 37 (74.0) Wheezing 17 (44.7) 37 (74.0)* Treatment Systemic steroid 9 (23.7) 31 (62.0) Oxy LRTI was diagnosed clinically (by presentation of crackles, wheezing, decreased breath sounds, hypoxia, and tachypnea) the enrolled patients were infants up to 12 months of age who were hospitalized from September 2011 to May 2012 with an LRTI at a single medical center. serum samples for cytokine analysis were obtained at admission. 10 cytokines were assayed for in the serum samples. clinical data were displayed as a median and interquartile range (Table 1) and laboratory parameters were displayed as a mean and standard deviation (Table 2). Correlations between cytokine concentration and clinical or laboratory data were performed by calculating the Spearman correlation coefficient (r) a total of 88 patients were enrolled in this study, including 38 with RV infections (RV group) and 50 with RSV infections (RSV group) the characteristics of each group are listed in Table 1. Of the patients, 62% were male, and the proportion of each sex was not significantly different between the groups. on the 1st day of admission, 2 patients in the RV group and 2 patients in the RSV group experienced hypoxia. the frequency of wheezing was present in 48% of the patients. no significant differences were found between the 2 groups. in the RSV group, the concentration of IFN- did not reach statistical significance between in the patients with wheezing and in the patients without wheezing (10.575.71 pg/mL vs. 15.197.96 pg/mL, P=0.105) the concentration of IFN- was not significantly different between the RV group with wheezing and the RSV group without wheezing. the concentration of IL-10 was not significantly different between the RV group with wheezing and without wheezing. in the RV group, the concentration of IL-10 was higher in the patients with wheezing than in the patients without wheezing. in the RV group, the concentration of IL-10 did not reach statistical significance between in the patients without wheezing and in the patients with wheezing. patients' characteristics Total 123 infants were confirmed by respiratory virus RT-PCR and hospitalized. median age at admission was 3.5 months (interquartile range [IQR], 1\u20136 months) in the RV group and 2.7 months in the RSV group. pulmonary disease compared to the RSV group (Table 1) (P0.001) 2. Clinical characteristics The clinical characteristics for each patient are listed in Table 1. the duration of fever and cough before hospitalization was not significantly different between the groups. in the RV group, the concentration of IFN- was higher in the patients with wheezing than in the patients without wheezing. in the RV group, the concentration of IFN- did not reach statistical significance between in the patients with wheezing and in the patients without wheezing (10.575.71 pg/mL vs. 15.197.96 pg/mL, P=0.105) the concentration of IL-10 was not significantly different between the RV group with wheezing and without wheezing. in the RV group, the concentration of IL-10 was higher in the patients with wheezing than in the patients without wheezing. however, there was significant difference between patients with wheezing and without wheezing. pg/mL vs. 23.8016.13 pg/mL, P=0.801, contrasts with significant difference between the RV group without wheezing and the RSV group without wheezing. the comparisons of interleukin (IL)-10 between the rhinovirus (RV) group and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) groups were compared. the virus responsible for LRTI in up to 40.7% of hospitalized children was the RSV, which was responsible for LRTI in up to 40.7% of the hospitalized children. this was followed by the RV (30.9%) infants hospitalized with severe RSV disease had a reduction in IFN- levels in nasopharyngeal aspirates and decreased expression of IFN- by peripheral blood mononuclear cells16,17. previous study also showed that the expression levels of IFN- were higher at the time of RV infection and played an important role in RV-induced LRTI. the increased IL-10 level found during an acute viral infection may suggest resolution of the inflammatory process. there is evidence that patients with a decreased IL-10 response could have a greater inflammatory response to viral infections and an increased risk for wheezing23,24. RV induced LRTI is as important as RSV induced LRTI. RV induced LRTI combined with wheezing showed similar levels of IFN- and IL-10 in comparison with RSV induced LRTI."}
