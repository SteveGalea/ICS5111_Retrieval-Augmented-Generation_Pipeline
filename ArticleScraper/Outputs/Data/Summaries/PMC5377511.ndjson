{"summary": "sink traps can act as reservoirs of bacteria that cause nosocomial infections. a sink often operates as an open conduit to wastewater in a patient care area. the preferred method for addressing most of the environment-related transmission is to employ enhanced cleaning using chemical and physical agents. a surrogate organism could be easily tracked while remaining in the Enterobacteriaceae family. RESULTS Growth and colonization of GFP-expressing E. coli in the P-trap. the addition of tryptic soy broth promoted growth as early as day 1. a flanking sink (sink 5) was the only P-trap inoculated with GFP-expressing E. coli. a flanking sink (sink 5) was the only P-trap inoculated with GFP-expressing E. coli. an additional 7 days in each of the sinks in the sink gallery with an inoculum concentration of >1010 CFU/ml was detected in the strainers of sinks 2 and 3 on day 14. this finding validated the upward growth and growth rate in the tailpipe when nutrients were added. nonfluorescent colonies were occasionally observed in the P-trap water samples collected from the sinks. the x axis represents the designated zones of the sink counter. no fluorescent CFU were observed when GFP-expressing E. coli was inoculated into the offset drain tailpiece only 4 in. below the strainer. the next highest CFU count from the dispersal was recorded on the counter area near the faucets. there were no GFP-expressing E. coli CFU recorded on plates placed beyond 30 in. from the strainer, demarcating the range of dispersion under these experimental conditions. coli inoculated with GFP-expressing E. coli 0 0 0 0 Offset drain inoculated with GFP-expressing E. coli 0 NA NA NA Sink bowl coated with GFP-expressing E. coli 232 17 NA NA NA Strainer colonized with GFP-expressing E. coli 171 15 342 17 17 3 3 1 a NA, not applicable. growth and colonization of GFP-expressing E. coli in the P-trap. flanking sink (sink 5) was the only P-trap inoculated with GFP-expressing E. coli. inoculum concentrations of 106 CFU/ml and >1010 CFU/ml in sink 5 were found to be colonized with GFP-expressing E. coli after 7 days. escent colonies were observed in the P-traps attached to each of the sinks. fluorescent colonies were confirmed to be E. coli. fluorescent colonies were inoculated with GFP-expressing E. coli. no fluorescent CFU were observed when GFP-expressing E. coli was inoculated into the offset drain tailpiece only 4 in. below the strainer. dispersion was significantly higher along the axes and lower at the corners of the sink counter space. Fig. 3a, zones 4, 7 and 10) was also observed using microspheres. there were no GFP-expressing E. coli CFU recorded on plates placed beyond 30 in. from the strainer. DISCUSSION To mimic dispersion in a hospital setting, we first investigated whether GFP-expressing E. coli would establish consistent colonization in a sink trap. many recent reports demonstrate that P-traps become colonized with highly consequential Gammaproteobacteria, which then results in nosocomial transmission (29, 31, 32) s rapidly grew up the tailpipe to the strainer at approximately an inch per day. the biofilm promotes the upward growth of GFP-expressing E. coli in the tailpipe at an accelerated rate. transmission of bacteria between sinks was a key finding in this study. microbiology, sustainability, and dynamics might be very different. but backflow and inoculation issues could have parallels. it may not be sustainable to target intervention limited to a single isolated sink as a source of a particular pathogen. the use of similar sink bowls across these sinks only examines the dispersion pattern of this particular sink design. the sink-to-sink transmission may not be applicable to all wastewater plumbing systems. however, we speculate that transmission could occur on larger systems over greater time scales. a dedicated sink gallery was set up to simulate hand-washing sinks. the five hand-wash sink stations were identical in bowl designs and dimensions. each sink module was built with Corian integrated sink/countertops without an overflow and fitted with a 2-handle gooseneck faucet. a single isolated colony of GFP-expressing E. coli grown from a 80\u00b0C stock was inoculated into 5 ml tryptic soy broth (TSB) containing 100 g/ml ampicillin (ATCC medium 2855) the inoculum concentration and method varied for each experiment. the rest of the drain line was either autoclaved (strainer, tailpipe, and trap arms) prior to installation or surface disinfected with Caviwipes-1 (Meterx Research, Romulus, MI), maintaining at least 1 min of contact time. a daily regimen was followed in which 25 ml of TSB followed by 25 ml of 0.9% NaCl solution (saline) were added via the strainer. a distal sink (sink 5) was fitted with a P-trap inoculated with GFP-expressing E. coli. the effects of different inoculum concentrations of GFP-expressing E. coli were investigated. microsphere suspension was injected through a strainer attached to a Hert 4.5-in. offset drain tailpiece. counter space around the sink bowl was thoroughly wiped with alcohol wipes. polyester sheets precut to appropriate shapes were placed on the counter. dispersion measured using GFP-expressing E. coli was investigated in three experiments. 1010 CFU/ml GFP-expressing E. coli in saline was added to an autoclaved P-trap. a suspension of 1010 CFU/ml GFP-expressing E. coli was added with a syringe through the strainer into the drain line that was preautoclaved. additional plates were attached to the sink bowl, faucets, Plexiglas partitions and faucet handles using adhesive tape. the faucet was turned on for 5 min with a water flow rate of 1.8 to 3.0 liters/min. aliquots were plated to assess for the presence of GFP-expressing E. coli in source water. a single isolated colony of GFP-expressing E. coli grown from a 80\u00b0C stock was inoculated into 5 ml tryptic soy broth (TSB) containing 100 g/ml ampicillin (ATCC medium 2855) the inoculum concentration and method varied for each experiment. P-traps were plated on tryptic soy agar (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Sparks, MD) plates containing 100 g/ml ampicillin (TSA) to monitor the growth of GFP-expressing E. coli in the P-traps. sampling ports were drilled along the length of the drain line. sample swabs were pulse-vortexed in 3 ml saline. strainer, faucet aerator, and bowl surface were sampled. a distal sink (sink 5) was fitted with a P-trap inoculated with coli. fluoresbrite YO carboxylate microspheres (Polysciences, Inc.) had a 1-m diameter and maximum excitation and emission of 529 nm and 546 nm respectively. a 1-ml suspension of microspheres (1010 particles) was injected through a strainer attached to a Hert 4.5-in. the sink bowl was evenly coated with a 20-ml microsphere suspension (1010 particles/ml) using a disposable swab. the dispersion experiment was repeated following the protocol described above. to test whether live organisms from the surface of the sink bowl could be dispersed by running water. a nutrient regimen was followed for 14 days to promote the GFP-expressing E. coli colonization. the counter space was thoroughly disinfected with Caviwipes-1. TSA plates were placed 3 m away from the sink as negative controls."}
