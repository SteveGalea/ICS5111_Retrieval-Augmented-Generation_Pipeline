{"summary": "most viral respiratory infections in the intensive care unit (ICU) are community-associated cases with severe lower respiratory disease that can progress into respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) the remainder are infections seen in immunocompromised patients, such as transplantation [2,3] denovirus CMV VHF Virus family Orthomyxovirdae Paramyxovirdae Coronaviridae Herpesviridae Filoviridae Epidemiologic link Seasonal epidemic Seasonal epidemic, immunocompromised and transplant Laboratory exposure on known infected individual Contact with infected individual Military camps, mental health facilities Transplantation, immunosuppressive medications Endemic area or contact with infected individual Pulmonary clinical findings Primary alveolar pneumonia Alveolar influenza A infects only humans and predominates in children. a small number of individuals can develop primary pneumonia, which can progress to ARDS. the structure of influenza's viral envelope is important in viral infection and thus host cell immunity. avian influenza subtypes (H1, H2, and H3) bind preferentially to alpha-2,6-galactose sialic acid found in ciliated human respiratory tract epithelium [18], illustrating the easy transmission with coughing or sneezing. avian influenza subtypes (for example, H5N1) bind preferentially to alpha-2,3-galactose sialic acid. es and pneumocytes, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I up-regulation leads to antigen presentation of the HA and other subcapsular proteins. this eventually leads to natural killer cell destruction of infected cells and the development of neutralizing antibodies (largely against HA) by day 14 of infection [22]. upper airway infection precedes lower tract infection by 1 to 3 days. infection follows a pattern similar to influenza, with epidemics occurring in the winter months. nchodilators and corticosteroids are used for bronchospasm, and aerosolized ribivirin has been used in severe and high-risk cases. a recent study evaluating bronchiolitis in infants showed that corticosteroids had no effect on outcome. the initial outbreak rapidly spread into a global epidemic, with cases reported from 29 countries. SARS-CoV binds to CD209L (L-SIGN) and ACE-2, two functional receptors on the respiratory tract epithelium. ACE-2 has a key protective role in acute lung injury by reducing alveolar fluid. low mannose-binding lectin levels are thought to play a role in SARS pathogenesis. VZV pneumonia is a herpes virus, a common group of DNA viruses that have a lipid-containing envelope with surface glycoproteins. viral replication and assembly occur after integration of viral genes into the cellular DNA [60,61] viral replication and assembly lead to the clinical vesicles [60,61] antibodies are directed at the surface glycoprotein and lead to viral neutralization. cellular immunity drives local inflammation, leading to cell repair and vacuole removal. the virus becomes latent within the dorsal root ganglia. over 51 human adenovirus subtypes exist and clinical syndromes vary among subtypes. adenovirus is a DNA virus covered by a protein capsid without a lipid envelope. adenovirus is a DNA virus covered by a protein capsid without a lipid envelope. the most significant and severe disease syndromes are found in lung, liver, kidney, and heart transplant recipients. ribavirin and cidofovir antiviral therapy has been tried, but no controlled clinical trials exist. CMV causes both primary and latent infections. anti-CMV CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, leads to control of the disease. avoiding immune detection gives CMV the ability to remain latent after infection. the virus can be cultured from most bodily fluids, including blood, urine, stool, tears, semen, and breast milk. there are several antiviral agents available for systemic treatment of CMV. these agents include ganciclovir, valgancicilovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir. a wide number of geographically distributed viruses found worldwide. the VHFs include a wide number of geographically distributed viruses. in some cases, more massive hemorrhage can occur in the gastrointestinal and urinary tracts. in some cases, more massive hemorrhage can occur in the gastrointestinal and urinary tracts. the overwhelming viremia resulting in macrophage and dendritic cell apoptosis leads to impaired humoral immunity, which in turn leads to increase viral production. HFRS and HPS can be accompanied by abdominal pain and gastrointestinal disturbances. symptoms begin with a prodrome of fever, chills, and myalgias. symptoms begin with a prodrome of fever, chills, and myalgias. inducing mechanisms thought to be due to release of kinins and cytokines support this underlying process. treatment mainly is supportive, with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation being used in some cases.
