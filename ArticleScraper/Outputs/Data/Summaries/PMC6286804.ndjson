{"summary": "Hundreds of wild animal species are traded legally and illegally to satisfy the market for exotic pets. many of these species are native to tropical areas where catching them in the wild is economically more viable than captive breeding. the incidence of this trade is much more poorly documented as official recording mechanisms are lacking. more than 430,000 individuals (93%) in this trade are Asian species. Southeast Asia is considered a primate trade hotspot. china is the second-most primate diverse country in Asia.

of traded primates in news reports found by or surrendered to authorities in China. we examined public statements in the reports to evaluate how well the public could identify species in comparison with official identification in these same reports. we categorized the public recognition as unrecognized; primate (but not to species); or species level identification. based on information provided in the news reports, especially photographs, we assessed the taxonomic status to compare with the official identification. we followed the primate taxonomy as listed in The Handbook of the Mammals of the World, Volume 3 (Primates) Species Mention its Chinese name Primate \u2018Like a monkey\u2019 Unrecognized \u2018Animal\u2019 \u2018can\u2019t recognize\u2019 Whereabouts Zoo Be sent to a wildlife

year for each species. we divided the time span from 2000 to 2017 into three sections: 2000\u20132005, 2006\u20132011 and 2012\u20132017. rhesus macaque rescue events were reported in 10 years (2005, 2007, 2010\u20132017) and the Tibetan macaque (M. thibetana) in recent 7 years (2011\u20132017) the rescue news related to other species, however, was individually reported in no more than 6 years. the proportion of market rescues was significantly higher in 2006\u20132011 than the other time sections but fewer individuals were rescued from markets in 2000\u20132005. the proportion of market rescues was significantly higher in 2006\u20132011 than the other time sections. healthy individuals varied significantly over time in pygmy slow lorises (2 = 6.579, df = 2, p = 0.037) and rhesus macaques (2 = 8.812, df = 2, p = 0.014), rhesus macaques (2 = 8.812, df = 2, p = 0.012) and Tibetan macaques (2 = 9.563, df = 2, p = 0.008). the pygmy slow loris (Nycticebus bengalensis) was the most reported species with 329 (44.8%) individuals, followed by the rhesus macaque (M. mulatta, 165 individuals, 22.5%) and the pygmaeus (M. mulatta, 165 individuals, 22.5%) my slow loris (N. pygmaeus, 158, 21.5%), 13 of 27 primate species distributed in china were never reported. rhesus macaque rescue events were reported in 10 years (2005, 2007, 2010\u20132017) and the Tibetan macaque (M. thibetana) in recent 7 years. nine individuals (four records) of slow lorises and none of Tibetan macaques reported. 211 (56.7%) reports were located in residential areas, followed by 70 (18.8%) in wild areas, 54 (14.5%) during transporting and 37 (9.9%) in the market. proportion of market rescues was significantly higher in 2006\u20132011 than the other time sections. the proportion of healthy individuals rescued was significantly lower in 2006\u20132011 than the other two time periods (2 = 6.140, df = 2, p = 0.046) the percentage of healthy individuals varied significantly over time in Bengal slow lorises (2 = 6.579, df = 2, p = 0.037) as well as the percentage of injured individuals in pygmy slow lorises (2 = 8.503, df = 2, p = 0.014) the official recognition was reported to species level in all of the news reports. species in 14.5% (32/220) of news including photos were incorrectly identified. the pygmy slow loris contributed most (26/32, 81.3%) to these wrong identifications. rhesus macaques composed a large proportion of rescuing reports. it was consistent with the fact that it is the most abundant primate species in china. a large number of slow lorises rescued may be originally from captive populations. a bulk of rescuing events took place in southwestern PLAUs, including Yunnan, Guangxi, Guizhou, Tibet and Sichuan. this is consistent with the highest primate diversity in this area. these areas are situated near Southeast Asia, which is a hotspot for global biodiversity. primate individuals were mostly sent to zoos, rescue centres or released into the wild after being rescued. lack of discrimination in the trade, especially in morphology, impedes assessing each taxon\u2019s potential vulnerability to trade. more than one third of individuals of slow lorises died within the first 6 months in rescue centres in southern Yunnan. the problem of rehabilitating captive animals without regard to genetic and ecological assessments has become another difficult issue that remains to be resolved. the discrepancy between few CITES trade records and massive rescuing news reports of slow lorises in china emphasize a need of more reliable and comprehensive understanding of some species. the success of wildlife conservation largely depends on public perspective, as well as assessment of causes that influence their outlook. a common problem in the enforcement of legislation to protect animals from illegal trade is the inability to identify species due to inadequate funding, education and staffing. it is highly recommended that an approach concerning awareness initiatives and education programmes should be developed towards the public to make them more conscious about the illegal wildlife trade. by 2008, 40 primate-breeding centres in china contained over 40,000 individuals. rhesus macaques composed a large proportion of rescuing reports. it was consistent with the fact that it is the most abundant primate species in

primate species, particularly pygmy slow lorises, are threatened by domestic illegal trade. lack of public knowledge impedes efforts to conserve these species effectively. data shows preliminary
