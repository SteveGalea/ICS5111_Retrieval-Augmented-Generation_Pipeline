{"summary": "genetic testing for hereditary colorectal cancer (HCRC) had significant psychological consequences for test recipients. 71 individuals completed the study, including 39 mutated gene carriers. up to 43% of adults who tested positive for familial adenomatous polyposis were clinically anxious after receiving their genetic testing result. despite these inconsistent findings, some studies have shown that carriers tend to exhibit at least a transient increase in their anxiety levels after disclosure. hope has three interrelated cognitive components: goals, agency and pathways. a guiding assumption of Snyder's hope model is that human actions are goal-directed. goals themselves are the cognitive anchors of hopeful thinking [19] ence is conceptualized as an individual's ability to maintain a relatively stable and healthy level of psychological and physical functioning after a traumatic event. a prototypical trajectory outcome, termed recovery, represents individuals who initially experience elevations in symptoms and distress, followed by a gradual reduction and return to the population norm. high-hope HCRC genetic testing recipients would have a higher tendency to show a resilience outcome trajectory pattern than low-hope counterparts. no prior study has yet examined the prevalence of the prototypical outcome trajectories following genetic testing. hope and Coping with Cancer Personal characteristics may have an important effect on adjustment to HCRC genetic testing. high-hope individuals will be distressed only temporarily and will bounce back full of energy and ideas on how to achieve their life goals [22]. research shows hope is a significant predictor of psychological well-being not only among healthy people but also among individuals with chronic illnesses such as spinal cord injuries [24] and cancer [25-28]. people in each category tend to vary depending on severity and type of trauma. a higher percentage of people in the chronic dysfunction category (42%) than in other previous studies. previous studies have used normative comparison approach to define health and dysfunction. 71 individuals (43 men and 28 women) from nine FAP and 24 HNPCC families completed the study. there were 27 (38.0%) subjects (15 men, 12 women) from FAP families and 44 (62.0%) subjects (28 men, 16 women) from HNPCC families. the 14-item Chinese version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was used to indicate negative emotions. two scores - HADS Anxiety and HADS Depression- were derived from the questionnaire. we used the 7/8 cut-off of the HADS to classify each subject at each time point as a case (with a score 8) or a non-case (with a score 7). if the same subject had a HADS Anxiety score of 9 at T2, then he/she was considered to be a HADS Anxiety non-case at T3. 71 individuals (43 men and 28 women) from nine FAP and 24 HNPCC families participated in this study after giving informed consent. all of the subjects came from families with proven HCRC syndromes, including familial adenomatous polyposis. Measures Dispositional Hope - The 12-item Adult Trait Hope Scale was rated on the basis of an 8-point Likert scale (1 = definitely false to 8 = definitely true) the Cronbach's alpha for the total sample at T1 was 0.85. trajectories were created using the HADS Anxiety score at two weeks (T2), four months (T3), and 12 months (T4) post-HCRC genetic testing as separate outcome indicators. the following steps were employed to create the outcome trajectories. two weeks post-result disclosure (T2) Four months post- result disclosure (T3) One year post- result disclosure (T4) Resilience Non-case Non-case Non-case Chronic Case Case Case Recovery Case Non-case Non-case Delay Non-case Case Case Non-case Non-case Case Results Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) ICC(1) values of predictors at T1 and psychological indicators at T2 were calculated to examine the independence of the data. no significant difference for any variable was obtained at any time points. subjects with a positive genetic test result had higher HADS Anxiety scores at both T2 and T4. a small portion of the sample (4.3%) showed evidence of a variable pattern that could not be categorized into one of the four prototypical patterns. resilience (76.8%) was the most prevalent followed by delayed reaction (13.0%). a small portion of the sample (2.9%) evidenced a variable pattern that could not be categorized into one of the four prototypical patterns was not shown in the figure. hope to predict resilience after HCRC genetic testing was excluded from the regression analyses. genetic testing results coded as 0 = positive; 1 = negative; ap = 0.05; *p 0.05; **p 0.01. HADS Anxiety or HADS Depression at T1 0.22 0.17 1.71 0.56* 0.25 1.72 Hope Total at T1 0.11a 0.06 0.90 - 0.25* 0.11 0.78 Hope x Genetic Testing Results 0.62 5.15 1.85 -8.50 6.91 0.00 HADS Anxiety or HADS Depression at T1 the powers of the analyses undertaken to detect group differences in syndrome type (FAP versus HNPCC) and mutation status (carrier versus non-carrier) were low to modest, ranging from 0.10 to 0.51. no difference in the anxiety or depression level between the FAP and HNPCC subjects was observed at any time point. the results for HADS Anxiety and HADS Depression are first presented separately. a small portion of the sample (4.3%) showed evidence of a variable pattern that could not be categorized into any of the four prototypical patterns. a small percentage of subjects were classified as having chronic dysfunction. a small portion of the sample (2.9%) could not be classified in any of the prototypical trajectories. hope to predict resilience after HCRC genetic testing was excluded from the regression analyses. either HADS Anxiety or HADS Depression and the Hope Total score at T1 were entered together with the two interaction terms: Hope x Genetic Testing Results and HADS Anxiety or HADS Depression x Genetic Testing Results. recipients' dispositional hope at pre-disclosure baseline tended to be a significant individual predictor of resilience (Anxiety: = -0.11, p = 0.05; Depression: = -0.25, p 0.05). genetic testing results coded as 0 = positive; 1 = negative; ap = 0.05; *p 0.05; **p 0.01. this is the first study to examine the prevalence of different longitudinal outcome trajectories among HCRC genetic testing recipients. only a minority of our sample exhibited chronically elevated symptoms (8.7% for HADS Anxiety and 7.2% for HADS Depression) our results suggest that the percentage of recipients showing chronic anxiety and depression levels is likely to drop even further to around 7%-9% at 12 months. this result is consistent with previous observations in western countries. supposition that these factors may affect the prevalence of delayed reaction trajectories is tentative. supposition that these factors may affect the prevalence of delayed reaction trajectories is tentative and should be investigated in independent studies. results of HCRC genetic testing may have been influenced by personality measures. results may have been influenced by other factors in their lives. authors declare they have no competing interests."}
