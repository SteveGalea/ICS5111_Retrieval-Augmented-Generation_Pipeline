{"summary": "the 2001 FMD epidemic in the uk had a substantial cost in human, animal health and economic terms. modeling now has a \u2018peace-time\u2019 contingency planning role. one weakness of modelling studies undertaken in 2001 was the relatively ad-hoc nature of the parameter estimation methods employed. a total of 134,986 farms in the UK were listed in the 2000 agricultural census. their spatial coordinates are provided together with the number of animals by species within each farm. a partition of all GB farms according to the animal types represented in Figure 1a. a total of 2026 infected premises (IPs) were recorded. 7457 other (non-IP) farms were also culled. some of the farms were recorded both as DCs and CPs. each farm i at the location (xi, yi) is associated with an infection time ti (if infected), a removal time ri (if slaughtered) and two integers representing the number of cattle and sheep on the farm. we use a continuous kernel to describe how the probability of contact between farms scaled with distance. the mixing matrix embedded in (2) quantifies the 4 species-specific mixing rates between animals on different farms: cattle-to-cattle (ScIc) sheep-to-cattle (ScIs), cattle-to-sheep (SsIc) and sheep-to-sheep (SsIs) this model formulation is identical to that used by Keeling et al. the parameter quantifies the degree to which mixing between species is assortative \u2013 with 1 representing assortative mixing and >1 disassortative mixing. the interaction model still assumes constant parameters with respect to time along the whole observation period T. the scripts pre and post are self-explanatory for time varying parameters. when fitting models with time varying infectivity parameters we actually fit Ipost and the ratio = Ipre/Ipost we called infectivity factor. all models above treat the epidemic as fully observed. DIC is a generalisation of the Akaike information criterion for Bayesian hierarchical models [20]. we define the complexity of a model by its effective number of parameters, pD, defined as where E[ ] represents taking expectations. the DIC is then defined as A lower value of DIC corresponds to a better model. a log scale has been used for sampling as the parameters were all positive definite. posterior distributions were estimated from 100,000 iterations. for the baseline model we achieved a 25% rate of acceptance. for the most complex model (8 parameters), a rate of approx 10%. a total of 2026 infected premises (IPs) were recorded. a total of 7457 other (non-IP) farms were also culled. some of the farms (about 30) were recorded both as DCs and CPs. s only and only 10 farms with just pigs were diagnosed as IPs in 2001. this indicates that pigs contributed far less to the 2001 outbreak than many other FMD outbreaks. we discarded another three IPs due to missing information or possible mistakes regarding their location or number of animals. this model assumes susceptibility and infectiousness parameters scale linearly with the number of animals on the farm. the mixing matrix embedded in (2) quantifies the 4 species-specific mixing rates between animals on different farms: cattle-to-cattle (ScIc) sheep-to-cattle (ScIc), cattle-to-sheep (SsIc) and sheep-to-sheep (SsIc) this model formulation is identical to that used by Keeling et is not infected contributes to the overall likelihood the probability that it escapes infection during the observation period, i.e. until the time it is culled (ri) or for the duration of the epidemic T, whichever is shorter. we fitted four time-varying model variants: (i) varying cattle infectivity by a factor and keeping sheep infectivity constant through time. (ii) varying both cattle and sheep infectivity by the same ratio. for the last model variant we also fitted a version which includes non-assortative mixing between species. the posterior mean deviance is defined as: where logP(y|) is the log-likelihood function for the observed data vector y given the parameter vector and C is a constant which does not need to be known for model-comparison purposes. the smaller the mean posterior deviance, the better the corresponding model fits the data. the MCMC sampler was allowed to equilibrate with convergence being evaluated visually from the likelihood and parameter traces. for the simpler models, 5,000 iterations were sufficient for equilibration, while this increased to 20,000 for the most complex models. s of the infectivity parameter estimates indicate (unsurprisingly) slight confounding between the 4 infectivity and susceptibility parameters. models conditioned on the first infection and 23rd February time changing point if applicable.
