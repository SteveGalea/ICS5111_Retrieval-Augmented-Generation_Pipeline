{"summary": "wild-type (WT), CXCL1/, and CXCR2/ mice each received an intracerebroventricular injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) chimeric mice were generated by transferring bone marrow cells between the WT and CXCR2/ mice. the intravenous injection of the antagonist SB225002 inhibited endothelial activation and leukocyte recruitment. astrocytes and endothelial CXCR2 play essential roles in cerebral endothelial activation and subsequent leukocyte recruitment during neuroinflammation."}
