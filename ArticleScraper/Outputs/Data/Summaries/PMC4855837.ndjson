{"summary": "the spike glycoprotein (S) of PEDV plays a pivotal role in induction of neutralizing antibodies against PEDV. in an attempt to develop a subunit vaccine for PEDV, we cloned two different fragments of S protein and expressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged fusion proteins, namely rGST-COE and rGST-S1D. soluble production of recombinant spike protein of PEDV, rGST-COE and rGST-S1D was achieved by using TF chaperone co-expression system. our results suggest that soluble rGST-COE and rGST-S1D produced by co-expressing chaperones may have the potential to be used as subunit vaccine antigens."}
