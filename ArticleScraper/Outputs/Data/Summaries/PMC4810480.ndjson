{"summary": "the transmission chain of MERS-CoV and the timeline of potential viral exposure, symptom onset, and date of genome collection from the patients admitted to Chungnam National University Hospital are presented in Fig. 1. a secondary infection case (patient E) who had close contact with the index case (patient A) in hospital P is included in this study. 26 mutations were found only in the south Korean isolates. fourteen of these are nonsynonymous mutations that result in changes of amino acids in ORF1a, S, and ORF4b. a deletion mutation in ORF4b causes a frameshift and fusion of ORF4b and ORF5. PLpro/ADRP, papain-like protease/ADP-ribose 1\u2032 -phosphatase; Prim, primase; RdRp, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; Hel, helicase; ExoN, exonuclease N; 2'OMT, S-adenosylmethionine-dependent ribose 2'-O-methyltransferase; E, envelope; 510G mutation disrupts the ionic interaction with CD26. it introduces a polar side chain to a hydrophobic residue cluster (L506, L554, and A556). this could affect the energetic stability of the interfacial beta sheets of RBD. in the case of D510G RBD, it binds to CD26 with a Kd of 316 nM (Kon, 5.02 103 M1 s1; Koff, 1.59 103 s1), which is almost 4.9 times lower than wild-type RBD. to further confirm the reduced affinity, purified RBD mutants were analysed for CD26 binding in 293T cells stably expressing CD26. the reduction in viral entry by the I529T mutation is specifically dependent on its interaction with CD26. each purified RBD protein tagged with His was serially diluted 2-fold (dilutions starting from 4 or 8 g/ml) each purified RBD protein tagged with His was then incubated with 2 105 cells. patients who recovered provided their written, informed consent to participation. RNAs were extracted from sputum or tracheal aspirate samples. the genome was converted to DNA and amplified by PCR in 30 overlapping amplicons. the contacts of particular residues were identified using CSU software (http://ligin.weizmann.ac.il/lpcccsu/) the human CD26 and MERS-CoV RBD (wild-type and mutant) proteins used for surface plasmon resonance experiments were prepared using the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system. PBST buffer (10 mM PO4 [pH 7.4], 2.4 mM KCl, 138 mM NaCl, 0.05% [vol/vol] Tween 20) was used throughout the experiments. each RBD protein (wild-type protein and D510G and I529T mutant proteins) with gradient concentrations (0, 80, 160, 320, and 640 nM) was prepared. or mutant RBD proteins were serially diluted 2-fold and incubated with 2 105 293T cells overexpressing CD26 in 200 l of Dulbecco modified Eagle medium. cells were stained with rabbit anti-His antibody (Santa Cruz) and anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (Life Technologies) for flow cytometric analysis. 93T cells were lysed 48 h after infection. luciferase activity in cell lysates was measured using a luciferase assay kit. expression of CD26 in 293T cell line was confirmed by flow cytometry."}
