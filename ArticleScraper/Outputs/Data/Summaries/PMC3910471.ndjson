{"summary": "the large-scale spatiotemporal spreading of diseases transmitted person to person via droplets or direct contact in real population is ultimately denominated by the population interaction. networks have provided a unified way to think about the daily interaction between individuals, especially when each individual is in direct contact with only a small proportion of the population. j will enter into a specific group C 1 and thus will suffer from higher risk from infectives in this group than in the general community. the MEs will result in a different population structure as shown in Figure 1(c) in contrast to that shown in Figure 1(b) the MEs will also take effects for business travellers who would be most likely to enter into a specific workgroup. in this paper we present a metapopulation model with the individuals in each subpopulation organised into a scale-free contact network. the subpopulations are interconnected through two types of the long-distance travel based on whether the travellers are merging into the contact network of the destination subpopulation. the results show that the MEs have constantly accelerated and aggravated the propagating processes of the epidemics. the instantaneous risk of infection c coming from regular contacts for node v is defined by c = k N ( v) I k c n + k V N ( v) the instantaneous risk of infection for node v at time t will be v = c + r = k N ( v) long-distance travel behaviours are greatly associated to these household and work groups. this implies homogeneous mixing assumption is made when quantifying the risk of infection for long-distance travellers. we have introduced the MEs into our model to investigate the influences of the travel types. j randomly selects a node v from the contact network of P 1. then all nodes k N(v) and v itself will be added to N(j) however, if j is a tourism traveller, it will be regarded as an isolated node in the contact network. the individuals in subpopulation P will make their long-distance travel at the rate P. the long-distance travellers in P will end the travel and return to their original subpopulations at the rate P. we have assumed R 0 = 1.6 according to some recent estimations. the risk of infection for each susceptible is evaluated at each time step (0.5 day) the social contact network could capture the regular contacts which could lead to the potential transmission of the diseases. the workplaces have been reported to obey a power law distribution for the number of employees in most countries. the instantaneous risk of infection c coming from regular contacts for node v is defined by c = k N ( v ) I k c n + k V N ( v ) the probability of node v getting infected at time t will be p = 1 exp( v t) infective i makes VFR travel to P 2 instead of leading to an equivalent risk of infection to every individual in P 2. this higher risk will then be transferred to community C 2 through the overlapping individual k. this higher risk will then be transferred to community C 2 through the overlapping individual k. long-distance traveller j has two high-risk exposures, denoted by node 1 and node 2 and only suffers from occasional risk of infection from other individuals. j has two high-risk exposures, denoted by node 1 and node 2. our model involves two transmission rates, for example, c from regular contacts and r from random contacts. we assume that c = 10 r and the latent and infectious periods are respectively, 1/ = 1.5 and 1/ = 2.5 days. at simulation time t = 0, the epidemic is seeded in one subpopulation (P 1). an alternative method is to simulate an epidemic and look at the intrinsic growth rate of the infected population. this growth rate r is defined as the rate at which the total number of infectives, I, grows in a susceptible population. the aggregated susceptibles in P 1 and P 2 regarding the simulation time steps. for both of the subpopulations, the population size N = 1000000, = 0.0006, and = 0.2. all the results have been averaged from 100 simulations. the results show that the presence of the MEs has greatly accelerated the spread process of the epidemics from initial epidemic stricken area (P 1) to the interconnected population (P 2). the susceptibles will first drop below 90% and 50% at time steps 42 and 58. the accelerating effect and aggravating effect will be strengthened with the increase of the merging intensity. Figure 4(b) shows the variation of FPT50% of the susceptibles of the two populations with different. Equation (8) indicates that the SSteps(t) are actually the areas surrounded by the axes, the susceptible curve, current time step t, and the simulation period T. a more rapid drop of the susceptibles and a lower escape rate both will decrease the SSteps(t) the presence of the MEs has greatly accelerated and aggravated the epidemics. the aggregate influence of the return rate is uncertain, which is verified by Figure 6. 3.4. Metapopulation Simulation To illustrate the influences of the MEs on the large-scale spatial disease dynamics, we have conducted a simulation which involves more subpopulations. the mobility network is exactly the same as shown in Figure 1a. the distribution of the high-risk exposures is shown in Figure 2(b), which displays scale-free regime with P(k) k 2.19, where k is the exposures. the reproductive number R 0 is determined by the transmission rate and the infectious period 1/ (R 0 = /), while in structural model, R 0 is determined by the characteristics of both the virus and the structure of the population. sensitivity analysis for, and indicates that R 0 is relatively constant. the respective susceptibles in P 1 and P 2 regarding the simulation time steps with no MEs ( = 0) and merging intensity = 0.6. both subpopulations, N = 1000000, = 0.6, and = 0.2. all the results have been averaged 100 times. 3.2. Accelerating and Aggravating Effects. the individuals in the two populations (P 1 and P 2) have fortunately escaped from the infection when = 0.6 are less than those when = 0. the investigation on the infectives with respect to the time steps reaches a similar conclusion, which shows that the epidemics peak much earlier and more dramatically. the person years or person months measurement takes into account both the number of people in the study and the amount of time each person spends in the study. Equation (8) indicates that the SSteps are actually the areas surrounded by the axes, the susceptible curve, current time step t, and the simulation period T. a higher return rate implies that more individuals will return to their resident subpopulations. a higher return rate means that the duration of the long-distance travel (with mean duration 1/) will be much shorter and thus will decrease the probability of being infected and of infecting the others. we have characterised the influences of long-distance travel behaviours on the large-scale spatial disease dynamics. results indicate that the presence of the MEs has greatly speeded up the transmission of the diseases and also aggravated the epidemics. sensitivity analyses for the merging intensity have shown the constant presence of the accelerating and aggravating effects."}
