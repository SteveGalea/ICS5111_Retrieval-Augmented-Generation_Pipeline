{"summary": "the world health organization (WHO) was tasked with developing a consistent and interoperable influenza severity assessment terminology and methodology. the first session aimed at bridging the gap between outcomes measured in clinical trials and those detected in public-health surveillance systems. the issue of under-recognised influenza mortality was investigated in-depth by jess Castillo. asymptomatic influenza and atypical presentations may never be identified as influenza-related. he presented recent data from post-mortem screenings for influenza in funeral parlours in Navarra, Spain. his group, which is part of the Integrated Monitoring of Vaccines in Europe, studies the hidden mortality associated with influenza infection. the partnering for Enhanced Digital Surveillance of Influenza-like disease and the effect of antivirals and Vaccines (PEDSIDEA) project offers the opportunity to gather real-time information on individual-level disease severity across different settings and age groups, including children. the CDC has been working to improve mathematical forecasting models. the utility of compiling various models into \u2018ensemble\u2019 models will be the next step. eight countries in sub-saharan Africa have been able to produce estimates for influenza-associated hospitalisations. euroMoMo collects data on weekly all-cause deaths from 24 participating countries. excess and influenza-attributable mortality during the 2017/18 season, with mainly influenza B circulation, was comparable to A(H3N2) seasons. surveillance and disease burden assessments can be done in low-resource environments. but more cost-effectiveness studies are warranted to further improve prevention and control of influenza infections in underserved communities."}
