{"summary": "osteoarthritis of the femoral head (ONFH) is the major cause of total hip arthroplasty in young adults (1). more than 1 million new patients are affected annually and the annual incidence is 15 to 20 million. icariin is widely used as a major active ingredient to prevent osteonecrosis induced by glucocorticoids in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome. previous study revealed that icariin regulated cell proliferation and osteogenic differentiation in MC3T3-E1 cells. however, the mechanism underlying the association between icariin and BMAL1 in osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs remains unclear. basic medium was supplemented with 107 mol/l dexamethasone, 102 mol/l sodium -glycerophosphate and 50 g/ml L-ascorbic acid. each experiment was performed in triplicate. cell pellet was collected by transient centrifugation at 400 g at room temperature for 5 min. resuspended in 100 l ice-cold PBS supplemented with 0.5% BSA. cells were identified by negative expression of CD34 [phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled; cat. no. 128611; BioLegend, Inc.] and CD45 (FITC-labeled; cat. no. 128611; BioLegend the stepOnePlusTM real-time PCR system was used for mRNA quantification. the primer sequences were as follows: BMAL1 forward, 5\u2032-AACCTTCCCGCAGCTAACAG-3\u2032 and reverse, 5\u2032-AGTCCTCTCTTTGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG western blotting Total protein was extracted with RIPA buffer (Sigma-Aldrich; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) the immunoblots were visualized and detected using the ECL system (Pierce; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.)

Western blotting Total protein was extracted with RIPA buffer (Sigma-Aldrich; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) cell lysates with 50 g of total protein were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto PVDF membranes, and then blocked in TBST with 5% non-fat dried milk for 1 h at room temperature after washing. BMSCs were cultured in 6-well plates with specific media to appropriate confluence. then transfected with BMAL1, BMAL1-shRNAs or empty vector overnight. cells were co-transfected with pRL-SV40 and firefly luciferase reporter vectors. a total of 20 3-week-old female Sprague-Dawley rats were sacrificed by the intraperitoneal injection of 100 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital. BMSCs were extracted from femurs and tibias by aseptic manipulation. for osteogenic induction, basic medium was supplemented with 107 mol/l dexamethasone. all the experimental protocols involving animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. all experiments were performed in triplicate. the cells were resuspended in 100 l ice-cold PBS supplemented with 0.5% BSA (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) for 20 min at 4\u00b0C. negative expression of CD34 [phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled; cat. no. 128611; BioLegend, Inc.] and CD45 (FITC-labeled; cat. no. 202205; BioLegend, primer sequences used for PCR were as follows: BMAL1 forward, 5\u2032-AACCTTCCCGCAGCTAACAG-3\u2032 and reverse, 5\u2032-AGTCCTCTTTGGGCCACCTT-3\u2032. the reaction conditions were as follows: 95\u00b0C for 15 sec, 60\u00b0C for 20 sec and 75\u00b0C for 10 sec after denaturing DNA templates at 95\u00b0C for 10 min. cell lysates with 50 g of total protein were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. the membranes were incubated with primary monoclonal mouse antibodies targeted against: BMAL1 (1:1,000; cat. no. ab93806; abcam), BMP2 (1:1,000; cat. no. ab14933; abcam), RUNX2 (1:1,000; cat. no. ab9227; Abcam), OC (1:1,000; cat. no. ab8227; Ab BMSCs were grown to 30\u201370% confluence and then transfected with BMAL1-shRNAs or empty vector overnight. the following day, the cells were co-transfected with pRL-SV40 Renilla luciferase reporter plasmids and firefly luciferase reporter vectors.

BMAL1 induces osteogenic differentiation via BMP2 in BMSCs. BMAL1 overexpression increased expression of osteogenic differentiation-associated genes. BMAL1 overexpression increased expression of osteogenic differentiation-associated genes. western blotting also showed that levels of BMP2, RUNX2, ALP and OC were lower in the BMAL1/ BMSCs compared to the WT BMSCs. BMAL1 overexpression also upregulated BMP2 and RUNX2 expression compared with the control group. BMSCs were treated with icariin (1010103 M) for 48 h. mRNA expression and protein level of osteogenic genes in control and 107 M icariin-treated groups. Icariin regulates BMAL1 in BMSCs. icariin induced BMAL1 expression in BMSCs. BMAL1 overexpression increased expression of osteogenic differentiation-associated genes. BMAL1 overexpression increased expression of osteogenic differentiation-associated genes. BMAL1 deficiency suppresses osteogenic differentiation in BMSCs. BMAL1 deficiency suppresses osteogenic differentiation in BMSCs. western blotting also showed that levels of BMP2, RUNX2, ALP and OC were lower in BMAL1/ BMSCs compared to the WT BMSCs. percentages of CD73-positive cells, CD90-positive cells and CD105-positive cells were 99.8, 99.7 and 99.9% respectively. percentages of CD34-positive cells and CD45-positive cells were 3.66 and 1.2% respectively. BMSCs were stained for cell surface markers. RT-qPCR and western blotting showed that icariin significantly increased the expression of BMP2, RUNX2, ALP and OC. BMAL1 expression of 107 M icariin-treated cells was evaluated by RT-qPCR. BMAL1 deficiency suppresses osteogenic differentiation in BMSCs. western blotting also showed that levels of BMP2, RUNX2, ALP and OC were lower in the BMAL1/ BMSCs compared to the WT BMSCs. BMAL1 overexpression also upregulated BMP2 and RUNX2 expression compared with the control group. icariin could enhance the BMP2 signaling pathway by upregulating BMAL1 expression in vitro. a number of studies have suggested that the activity of clock genes is closely correlated with BMPs. one study reported that regulation of clock genes controlled BMP2 expression in osteoblasts. BMAL1 regulation of TGF- and BMP signaling in the control of fat adipogenesis has also been reported. the results of the present study suggest that icariin at a concentration range between 109 and 105 mol/l significantly promoted the proliferation of BMSCs. icariin stimulated the proliferation of UMR 106 cells at concentrations ranging from 1014 to 106 mol/l. the present study is the first to provide evidence that icariin promoted osteogenic differentiation through BMAL1-BMP2/RUNX2 signaling. authors declare they have no competing interests."}
