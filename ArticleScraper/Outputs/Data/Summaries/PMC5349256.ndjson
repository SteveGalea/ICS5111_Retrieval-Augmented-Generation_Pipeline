{"summary": "EVD is one of the most dreaded infectious diseases known to mankind in the 21st century. its high mortality rate, which ranges from 25 and 90%, has made the disease one of the most challenging public health issues in recent years. the disease was first described in 1976 in democratic Republic of Congo. eLife 2014;3:e04395.6 Table 1. Health system profiles of countries with Ebola viral diseases (EVD) outbreak and at-risk countries of EVD outbreaks.6-11 Country Total population, millions Population at risk of EVD, millions Current GDP, US $ billion Physicians/1000 population Hospital bed capacity Health expenditure (% of GDP) EVD is caused by one of five species of Ebola viruses, namely, Zaire (most fatal), Sudan, Tai Forest, Bundibugyo and Reston. most fatal outbreaks have been caused by Zaire ebolavirus, Sudan ebolavirus and Bundibugyo ebolavirus. the outbreak dated back to December 2, 2013 or possibly earlier. it is traceable to a single index case (a 2-year old child in Gueckedou Prefecture of Guinea who died of the disease on Dec 6, 2013) the disease is traceable to a single index case whose family admitted to having hunted two species of bat-Hypsignatus monstrosus and Epomops franqueti. authors reviewed 5 online databases and a hand search of the reference list of key articles. we reviewed 51 articles that were relevant up until the end date of the search on August 18, 2016. we excluded articles on Ebola cases outside Africa. the threat is particularly acute in most part of sub-sahara Africa. most countries lack isolation and treatment units to care for patients. the threat is particularly acute in most part of sub-sahara Africa. the risk of an outbreak following importation is low in developed countries with robust surveillance and infection control systems. this amplified risk brings up an additional burden of disease and risk in many resource-poor countries, which are still struggling to address the unfinished agenda of infectious diseases. large colonies of fruit bats migrate long distances to take advantage of fruit pulses in other regions of the continent. these stop-overs provide a unique opportunity for local populations to massively hunt bats, either for food or commercial purposes. the 2007 EVD outbreak in DRC was traced to massive bat hunting following an influx of bats in the Occidental Kasai Province during a peak fruit season. population explosion has led to massive human encroachment of rain forests and wildlife reserves. this has triggered migration of species to other areas where environmental conditions are more favorable for survival24. this carries a risk of pernicious pathogens introduction into other regions of the world. decreased fish catch, resulting from over-fishing by subsidized Chinese and European vessels, has enhanced wildlife hunting and bush meat consumption in several fishing communities along the west coast of africa. economic hardship, unemployment, droughts and declining soil fertility have caused several villagers to resort to wildlife hunting and trade in bush meat. disparities in health equity and access to health care in most SSA nations are asymmetrically distributed. many rural and urban communities lack basic health care infrastructure, well-trained personnel and essential medical supplies. these factors contribute to diminished appeal and widespread erratic utilization of health services in most SSA settings. lack of diagnostic facilities and surveillance can hamper containment efforts of major public health threats like EVD. lack of effective public health surveillance systems in these countries has hampered contact tracing efforts. lack of effective quarantine mechanisms in these countries has hampered contact tracing efforts. a particular weakness in reporting systems in many sub-sahara africa countries is that they are still heavily paper-based, especially at the peripheral levels. common root causes of under-reporting of health information include poor health seeking behavior, weak surveillance networks and poor health financing. lack of effective health stewardship (governance) in the crises nations has pointed out major flaws in health stewardship (governance) health professionals in Nigeria went on strike shortly before the outbreak of Ebola. urgent action is needed to prepare nations for imminent public health challenges. a number of studies have reported the impact of climate change on EVD outbreaks in Africa23. large colonies of fruit bats migrate long distances to take advantage of fruit pulses in other regions of the continent. these stop-overs provide a unique opportunity for local populations to massively hunt bats, either for food or commercial purposes. the 2007 EVD outbreak in DRC was traced to massive bat hunting following an influx of bats in the Occidental Kasai Province during a peak fruit season. over eight-fold, in the last century33 has resulted into profound changes in the relationship between humans and the ecosystem. anthropogenic activities have led to massive human encroachment of rain forests and wildlife reserves. consequent destruction of habitats for several mammals, including, non-human primates (NHP) and fruit bats. this has triggered migration of species to other areas where environmental conditions are more favorable for survival24. decreased fish catch, resulting from over-fishing by subsidized Chinese and European vessels, has enhanced wildlife hunting and bush meat consumption in several fishing

crises nations has pointed out major flaws in health stewardship (governance) the few established treatment centers are understaffed and lack the resources to maintain appropriate infection control systems or provide adequate supportive care to patients. there seems to be no sense of effectiveness on the part of the respective governments to resolve the imbroglio in health system despite the public health emergency-EVD outbreak. the sub-region has witnessed remarkable economic growth, far above global average. this has spurred rapid development in almost all areas of society. this has spurred rapid development in almost all areas of society. experts believe that the risks of EBV spreading beyond the confines of west africa are extremely low. this low risk should not be under-estimated, as there are still potential for expatriates or other travelers to introduce the disease into other settings. in 2000 a south africa health professional contracted the disease while treating patients in Gabon and upon his return, he infected a nurse. the impact of these cultural beliefs and practices in driving the spread of EVD is clearly visible in the current west africa and historic EVD epidemics. the impact of these cultural beliefs and practices in driving the spread of EVD is clearly visible in the current west africa and historic EVD epidemics. many villagers blame foreign aid workers and government officials for spreading the diseases. similar misconceptions were reported during the outbreaks in DRC, Gabon and Uganda where local people linked the disease to activities. fear of contagion has caused many stakeholders to restrict movement of people and goods, thus halting trade and business transactions in the crises countries. a similar pattern was observed during the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, where fear associated with the outbreak was estimated to have impacted the global economy to a tune of 50 billion US Dollars. 240 health care professionals in Guinea, liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone have been stricken by the disease, leading to the death of 120.47. the collapse or near collapse of hitherto weak health systems is directly impacting the delivery of several public health interventions. the untoward impact on morbidity and mortality resulting from this neglect may far exceed the death toll from Ebola in the region. the impact of the disease on west africa and potentially, the global economy can be disastrous. a number of countries have closed their borders due to fear of importation of the disease. this response has increased isolation of these countries. there are reports where Ebola survivors were stigmatized by friends through desertion, while employers were unwilling to engage the victims. current trend needs to be reversed as countries, especially, neighboring west africa have taken extreme measures of shutting borders and banning flights. a similar pattern was observed during the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. fear associated with the outbreak was estimated to have impacted the global economy to a tune of 50 billion US Dollars. the consequences of the current EVD outbreak on the economies of the crises nations can reach 32.6 billion US Dollars by late 2015. the collapse or near collapse of hitherto weak health systems is directly impacting the delivery of several public health interventions. the untoward impact on morbidity and mortality resulting from this neglect may far exceed the death toll from Ebola in the region. this adaptation is an adaptation of an original work by the world bank. views and opinions expressed in the adaptation are the sole responsibility of the author or authors of the adaptation. a number of countries have closed their borders with the affected countries due to fear of importation of the disease. there are reports where Ebola survivors were stigmatized by friends through desertion, while employers were unwilling to engage the victims. current trend needs to be reversed urgently as countries, especially, neighboring west africa have taken extreme measures of shutting borders and banning flights. despite lack of empirical evidence about the efficacy of blood transfusions, blood from convalescent patients is being widely used in the current west africa epidemic to treat patients. however, further research with appropriate sample sizes and designs is needed in this area to establish the efficacy and safety of the strategy. in bioterrorism, frequent outbreaks and the need to protect specific risk groups have led to the evaluation of several clinically approved drugs in animal models. actived protein C88 and inhibitors of factor VIIa89 have shown some promising results in controlling coagulation disorders in animal models. ribavirin, a broad spectrum anti-viral agent against many hemorrhagic viruses, was shown to have no effect on EVD. a liberian doctor reported that 13 of 15 patients he treated with Lamivudine out of desperation survived. this finding should be viewed with caution due to the limited sample size and other potential confounders Brincidofovir. the drug has demonstrated in-vitro activity against Ebola virus and has been granted an emergency approval by USFDA. a Dutch company (Crucell) is developing a multivalent Ebola/Marburg vaccine. Phase I trials are expected to begin in the later quarter of 2015. despite lack of empirical evidence about the efficacy of blood transfusions, blood from convalescent patients is being widely used in the current west africa epidemic to treat patients. however, further research with appropriate sample sizes and designs is needed in this area to establish the efficacy and safety of the strategy. interest has led to the evaluation of several clinically approved drugs in animal models. for example, activated protein C88 and inhibitors of factor VIIa89 have shown some promising results in controlling coagulation disorders in animal models. the drug was used by Texas doctors to treat the first case of Ebola diagnosed in US soil BCX4430 A broad spectrum antiviral agent originally developed for Hepatitis C The drug has demonstrated in-vitro activity against a range of flavi viruses and has been granted an emergency approval by USFDA as an investigational treatment for EVD. developing a multivalent Ebola/Marburg vaccine and Phase I trials are expected to begin in the later quarter of 2015.82. Vaccine candidate Basic R&D Preclinical Phase I Phase II Ebola virus recombinant protein subunit + + Kunjin virus replicon particle + Plasmid DNA prime/adenovirus-expressed protein boost + + Various adenovirus-vectored + + Paramyxovirus-vectored + CMV- diagnostic drawbacks have a potentially negative impact on early diagnosis of outbreaks. this has hampered early initiation of measures to prevent severe disease outcomes as well as unprecedented spread of the virus. however, the technique has not received sufficient research attention. countries lack the regulatory, ethics, infrastructural and logistical capacity to support the conduct of clinical trials. however, this weakness may undermine the safety of subjects as well as credibility of clinical data. there is a clear need for targeted african nations to act responsibly and take appropriate measures to support these urgently needed interventions. containment measures are expensive and unsustainable in resource-poor settings with lean health budgets. the rising GDP in west africa enhanced by transport technology (including aviation) further amplifies the threat of global spread. the outbreak has been sustained in west africa owing to weak formal health care systems, water and sanitation challenges, poor health seeking behavior, burial and corpse management practices. multi-level and multi-sectoral approaches were adopted in Nigeria as containment and prevention strategies were not limited to health services. the use of multiple approaches to raise awareness such as e-health, use of SMS to send relevant health information and use of social websites were quite effective."}
