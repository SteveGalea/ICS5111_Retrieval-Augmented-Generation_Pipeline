{"summary": "nonenveloped virions are constructed from one major capsid protein (MCP) and one or a few minor CPs. enveloped virions often contain nucleocapsid proteins which form nucleoprotein complexes with the respective viral genomes. these proteins often constitute a considerable fraction of the virion mass, making it challenging to single out the major virion protein. pleomorphic bacterial viruses of the family Plasmaviridae, and 19 diverse taxa of eukaryotic viruses. number and diversity of newly recognized virus taxa will continue to rise. many of these viruses are expected

covered 64.4% of the known virosphere. of the remaining 11 minor classes, seven contained folds unique to a single virus family, three folds were found in two families each. 73 taxa (71%) have icosahedral virions and 29 taxa (29%) include viruses with helical (nucleo)capsids. those with icosahedral capsids belong to only six taxa (21%) unrelated folds of viral proteins that form helical (nucleo)capsids are largely -helical. the reasons for such a bias are unclear, given that cellular helical filaments can be formed from -strand\u2013based proteins. one of the most common functions of SJR domains in cellular proteins is carbohydrate recognition and binding. a search seeded with the CP of satellite panicum mosaic virus (PDB ID code: 1STM) retrieved the carbohydrate-binding module from Ruminococcus flavefaciens with a highly significant DALI Z score of 7.9. dsDNA bacteriophage P23-77 (PDB ID code: 3ZMO) of the family Sphaerolipoviridae. the rightmost structure corresponds to the virion of the human sTALL-1 protein. the linker region leading to the DNA-binding domain in AraC is shown in gray. soluble tumour necrosis factor- and Apo-L-related leucocyte-expressed ligand-1 (sTALL-1), a member of the TNF superfamily, has been shown to form 60-subunit (20 trimers) virus-like particles (42) that superficially resemble 60-subunit T = 1 virions (12 pentamers) of satellite tobacco necrosis virus (STNV) searches seeded with AraC from Escherichia coli resulted in a match to the CP of San Miguel sea lion virus (family Caliciviridae) with a Z score of 2.7. the ubiquity and functional diversity of cellular proteins testifies to their antiquity. some ssRNA and ssDNA viruses have largely unstructured, positively charged N-terminal domains that interact with the nucleic acids. clustering of the SJR proteins with DALI suggests that the CPs from the majority of RNA viruses and eukaryotic ssDNA viruses form a monophyletic group. the second largest architectural class includes viruses with the double jellyroll (DJR) MCP, which is found in 10% of the virus taxa. the DJR MCPs are exclusive to dsDNA viruses that are classified into 13 taxa and infect hosts from all three cellular domains. all sphaerolipoviruses encode two MCPs, each with the SJR fold, that form homo- and heterodimers involved in the formation of the icosahedral capsid. the two sphaerolipoviral CPs are most similar to each other among known protein structures. sphaerolipoviruses and DJR viruses share genome-packaging ATPases of the A32-like family (named after the respective fold is also found in the floor domain of the MCP of herpesviruses (order Herpesvirales) (68) outside the virosphere, the HK97-like fold is found only in encapsulins, a class of bacterial and archaeal nanocompartments. encapsulins form a tight, apparently monophyletic cluster, while viral MCPs are more divergent. a collection of structures of encapsulins (E, Upper Row) and major capsid proteins of members of the order Caudovirales (C, Lower Rows) all structures are colored using the rainbow scheme from blue (N terminus) to red (C terminus) the color scale indicates the corresponding Z scores. protease NS3 of hepatitis C virus (PDB ID code: 1RGQ) is recovered with a DALI Z score of 10.8. the protease HtrA from humans follows with a Z score of 10.6. the NS3 protease does not play a structural role in virion formation of flaviviruses. alphaviral capsid protein (Left) with protease NS3 of hepatitis C virus (Center) and human chymotrypsin-like protease HtrA1 (Right) all structures are colored using the rainbow scheme from blue (N terminus) to red (C terminus), and the corresponding PDB identifiers are shown. nairoviral-like ancestor acquired host-derived exonuclease domain. exo is proofreading exonuclease subunit of E. coli DNA polymerase III. evolution of a viral nucleocapsid from a nuclease has been recently demonstrated. several high-resolution structures are available for all three major Gag domains from various retroviruses. analysis of the retroviral MA structures reveals an -helical fold that is remarkably similar to that of the N-terminal HTH DNA-binding domain found in various integrases. a domain homologous to the C-terminal domain of the CA protein is commonly found in vertebrate transcription factors. the SCAN domain is always accompanied by multiple C2H2 zinc fingers and/or Kr\u00fcppel-associated box (KRAB) domains. the exact provenance of the ancestral SCAN-like dimerization domain remains uncertain. at least two of the three major building blocks of retroviral virions are likely to have evolved from cellular proteins. the matrix protein, Z, of arenaviruses performs multiple functions, one of which is to bridge the viral surface glycoprotein, the viral ribonucleoprotein, and the host cell budding machinery. matrix protein Z of Lassa mammarenavirus (LASV) and RING domain of ubiquitin (Ub) ligase E3 are colored using the rainbow scheme from blue (N terminus) to red (C terminus), and the corresponding PDB identifiers are shown. rhabdovirus matrix protein has a unique fold and is unrelated to the matrix proteins of other mononegaviruses (94) EBOV matrix protein and CypC obtained with low but significant Z scores. homologs from other mononegaviruses were obtained with similarly low Z scores. cyclophilins are known to play an important role in viral infections (98) the matrix protein-encoding gene of mononegaviruses likely evolved from a cyclophilin gene acquired from the host. the alternative possibility, i.e., that matrix protein of mononegaviruses is at the origin of cyclophilins, is hardly possible. nonenveloped virions are constructed from one major capsid protein (MCP) and one or a few minor CPs. enveloped virions often contain nucleocapsid (NC) proteins which form nucleoprotein complexes with the respective viral genomes, matrix proteins linking the nucleoprotein to the lipid membrane, and envelope proteins responsible for host recognition. category includes eight taxa of archaeal viruses with unique morphologies and genomes (30), pleomorphic bacterial viruses of the family Plasmaviridae, and 19 diverse taxa of eukaryotic viruses. number and diversity of newly recognized virus taxa will continue to rise. retro-like Eukarya ssRNA-RT Unassigned Pseudoviridae Icosahedral

exclusively -helical to -strand\u2013based. the inherent ability of so many structurally unrelated proteins to assemble into icosahedral particles refutes the argument that the structural similarity

the single jellyroll (SJR) is the most prevalent fold among viral CPs. ces cerevisiae protease Kex2 was retrieved with the CP of tobacco streak virus (Bromoviridae) with a Z score of 5.8. the third family of viral CP-like SJR proteins includes nucleoplasmins and nucleophosmins. the core SJR domain of nucleoplasmins/nucleophosmins forms stable pentameric and decameric complexes. RNA viruses are shown in green, ssDNA viruses in blue, and dsDNA viruses in red. all compared structures are indicated with the corresponding PDB identifiers. soluble tumour necrosis factor- and Apo-L-related ligand-1 (sTALL-1), a member of the TNF superfamily, is a trimer. the CP of cowpea mosaic virus (family Secoviridae) retrieved BclA (PDB ID code: 1NY7) with a Z score of 5.4. more divergent SJR domains are found in functionally diverse proteins of the Cupin superfamily (44) a protein with such a property would be immediately beneficial to the virus because it could ensure specific binding of the viral particle to the host cell. the alternative possibility, that viral CPs gave rise to cellular SJR proteins, appears less likely, given the wide taxonomic distribution. the most divergent among viral SJR proteins are CPs of parvoviruses, polyomaviruses, and papillomaviruses. the most divergent among viral CPs are CPs of parvoviruses, polyomaviruses, and papillomaviruses. a simple evolutionary scenario proposes that the ancestral DJR MCP derives from a SJR CP via gene duplication (21, 60) sphaerolipoviruses encode two MCPs, each with the SJR fold, that form homo- and heterodimers involved in the formation of the icosahedral capsid. HK97-like fold is characteristic of the MCPs of bacterial and archaeal members of the order Caudovirales (families Myoviridae, Siphoviridae, and Podoviridae) the HK97-fold is also found in the floor domain of the MCP of herpesviruses (order Herpesvirales) (68) encapsulins are encoded in certain groups of archaea, namely the phylum Crenarchaeota (73), which are not known to be parasitized by members of the order Caudovirales. the exact evolutionary relationship between encapsulins and viral MCPs remains unresolved. the protease NS3 of hepatitis C virus (PDB ID code: 1RGQ) is recovered with a DALI Z score of 10.8. the protease NS3 of hepatitis C virus (PDB ID code: 1RGQ) follows with a Z score of 10.6. the key adaptation was the addition of a positively charged N-terminal region to the protease domain, enabling the protein to bind viral RNA. the absence of a conserved C-terminal -helix in the C protein is not essential for virion formation (81). the NC protein of arenaviruses, such as Lassa mammarenavirus (LASV), contains a head domain similar to that of nairoviruses. the activity is conferred not by the head domain but by the dedicated C-terminal domain homologous to various exonucleases of the DEDDh superfamily. it seems highly probable that the arenaviral nucleocapsid evolved from a nairoviral-like ancestor by retroviral gag polyprotein is proteolytically processed into matrix (MA), capsid (CA) and NC proteins. some viruses contain additional domains, such as p6 in HIV-1 (86) retroviral proteins constituting the Gag polyprotein are homologous. a domain homologous to the C-terminal domain of the CA protein is commonly found in vertebrate transcription factors. it was previously concluded that known SCAN domains have been recruited from retrotransposons at or near the root of the tetrapod animal branch. however, the exact provenance of the ancestral SCAN-like dimerization domain remains uncertain. the NC protein contains one or two CCHC Zn-knuckle motifs and binds the viral genome (87). comparison of the LASV Z protein with the RING domain of human ubiquitin ligase returned a Z score of 4.3. protein from plants (XP_018837173) was retrieved with the E value of 8e-05 and showed 37% identity to the LASV Z. analysis of mononegaviral (except for rhabdoviral) matrix protein structures uncovered unexpected similarity to cyclophilins. cyclophilins are ubiquitous cellular proteins that possess peptidyl-prolyl-isomerase activity and participate in protein folding. these proteins also are receptors for the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A. pA is incorporated into virions by binding to capsids or nucleocapsids of many unrelated viruses, including HIV-1 (Retroviridae), vesicular stomatitis virus (Rhabdoviridae), vaccinia virus (Poxviridae), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (98). rhabdoviruses encode homologous NC proteins (99), the unrelated matrix proteins topology diagrams (Left) and structural models (Right) are colored using the rainbow scheme from blue (N terminus) to red (C terminus) the corresponding PDB identifiers are shown. the -hairpin insert in CypC is colored black. satellite panicum mosaic virus retrieved carbohydrate-binding module from Ruminococcus flavefaciens (PDB ID code: 1STM) with a highly significant DALI Z score of 7.9. similar results were obtained when searches were initiated with CPs from other virus families. the rightmost structure corresponds to the 60-subunit virion-like assembly of the human sTALL-1 protein. soluble tumour necrosis factor- and Apo-L-related leucocyte-expressed ligand-1 (sTALL-1) has been shown to form 60-subunit virion-like assembly of the human sTALL-1 protein. sTALL-1 is identified as a structural homolog of STNV CP with a DALI Z score of 7.7. more divergent SJR domains are found in functionally diverse proteins of the Cupin superfamily (44) the ubiquity and functional diversity of cellular proteins testifies to their antiquity. it is highly probable that cellular proteins with the SJR fold had experienced substantial diversification before the emergence of the last universal cellular ancestor. the original function of this protein could have involved recognition of carbohydrates. circoviral CPs are nested among RNA viruses, as is consistent with the previously proposed scenario in which the CP genes of some eukaryotic ssDNA viruses have been horizontally acquired from ssRNA viruses (50\u201355). the compact CPs of bromoviruses cluster with the P domain of Kex2-like subtilisin proteases, separately from other CPs, whereas the CPs of bacterial microviruses (ssDNA genomes DJR -strands are oriented vertically with respect to the capsid surface (20, 21, 56) DJR MCPs are exclusive to dsDNA viruses that are classified into 13 taxa and infect hosts from all three cellular domains. a straightforward evolutionary scenario proposes that the ancestral DJR MCP derives from a SJR CP via gene duplication (21, 60). ral CPs are most similar to each other among known protein structures. sphaerolipoviruses and DJR viruses share genome-packaging ATPases of the A32-like family (named after the respective protein of vaccinia virus) 64) that thus far have not been found in viruses with other viral SJR CPs. the HK97-like fold is found only in encapsulins, a class of bacterial and archaeal nanocompartments that encapsulate a variety of cargo proteins related to oxidative stress response. high-resolution structures are available for three encapsulins, which, similar to viruses, assemble into icosahedral T = 1 or T = 3 cages (70\u201372) alphavirus core (C) protein shares sequence similarity with chymotrypsin-like serine proteases (74, 75) the protein acts as a protease and cleaves off the C protein from the polyprotein precursor. flaviviruses and alphaviruses encode homologous class II envelope glycoproteins. unlike alphaviruses, flaviviruses do not form internal icosahedral capsids. flaviviruses do not form internal icosahedral capsids. the racket-shaped NC protein of nairoviruses (proposed family Nairoviridae) contains head and stalk domains. it has been shown that the head domain of the crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus nucleocapsid has a metal-dependent DNA-specific endonuclease activity. however, the protein does not display any similarity to known cellular nucleases. the exonuclease domains are colored using the rainbow scheme from blue (N terminus) to red (C terminus) evolution of a viral nucleocapsid from a nuclease has been recently demonstrated for the enveloped filamentous archaeal virus, Thermoproteus tenax virus 1 (TTV1) a DALI search seeded with the MA of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) resulted in a significant hit (Z score, 4.8) to the HTH domain from the integron integrase of Vibrio cholerae (PDB ID code: 2A3V) the retroviral matrix displays not only structural but also functional similarity to the DNA-binding HTH domains. ous to the C-terminal domain of the CA protein is commonly found in vertebrate transcription factors and is known as the \u201cSCAN domain\u201d (PF02023) the protein is always accompanied by multiple C2H2 zinc fingers and/or Kr\u00fcppel-associated box (KRAB) domains, none of which are of retroviral origin (90). es performs multiple functions, one of which is to bridge the viral surface glycoprotein, the viral ribonucleoprotein, and the host cell budding machinery (92) the N terminus of Z protein is myristoylated, facilitating its membrane anchoring and intracellular targeting. a protein from plants (XP_018837173) was retrieved with the E value of 8e-05. matrix proteins are available for mononegaviruses of the families Filoviridae, Bornaviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Pneumoviridae, and Rhabdoviridae. the rhabdovirus matrix protein has a unique fold and is unrelated to the matrix proteins of other mononegaviruses (94) the latter are homologous to each other and consist of one (bornaviruses) or two (filoviruses cyclophilins are known to play an important role in viral infections (98) cyclophilins are incorporated into virions by binding to capsids or nucleocapsids of many unrelated viruses, including HIV-1 (Retroviridae), vesicular stomatitis virus (Rhabdoviridae), vaccinia virus (Poxviridae) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV rhabdoviruses do not occupy the basal position within the order Mononegavirales. it is likely that the ancestral cyclophilin-like matrix protein-encoding gene was replaced in the rhabdovirus ancestor by a nonhomologous gene with similar properties. the origin of viral replicative modules seems likely to hark all the way back to the precellular era. some of these primordial replicators coalesced and gave rise to the first cellular genomes, whereas others became genetic parasites. however, such parasites gave rise to true viruses only after the emergence of cells. the evolution of virions can be considered the ultimate manifestation of virus\u2013host coevolution. the history of virions can be considered the ultimate manifestation of virus\u2013host coevolution. the relevance of the matches was evaluated further by visual inspection of structural alignments between the cellular and viral proteins. structural homologs were additionally searched for using the topSearch server (https://topsearch.services.came.sbg.ac.at/) the protein structures and sequences were downloaded from the research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB) protein data bank (www.rcsb.org) and the national center for biotechnology information (NCBI). structure-based searches were performed using the DALI server (34, 106) lsx (41.4KB, xlsx)."}
