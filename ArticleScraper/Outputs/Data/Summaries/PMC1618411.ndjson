{"summary": "phage display based epitope mapping is widely used in basic research. it has become a promising method for epitope mapping. most of the existing tools have not been implemented until now. phage display has become a promising epitope mapping method. the phage display based epitope mapping is usually accomplished through comparing the sequence of mimotopes (antibody-selected phage displayed peptides) to the antigen[2], there by indicating the location of the native epitope. a web-based tool for phage display based epitope mapping named MIMOX was coded with Perl as a CGI program. it can be used to align a set of mimotopes and derive a consensus sequence. the results mapped on to the antigen's 3D structure can then be viewed interactively. in the second section, MIMOX tries to map the user supplied sequence on to the given antigen structure. this is implemented as the script mimox.pl. the program NACCESS is also wrapped into mimox.pl. the script calculates the percentage frequency of each one. the frequency of a given amino acid X at the position i of the alignment is defined as f x i = X i N 100 %. the alignment can be managed with the embedded JalView[20]. the alignment can also be managed with the embedded JalView[20]. three methods are used to calculate neighbour residue pairs. one method is to take the distance between the C atoms as the distance between the two amino acids. the second method is to use the distance between the C atoms. each result is then ranked according to the sum of the results. overall architecture of MIMOX MIMOX was coded with Perl using modules from the Bioperl[18] project. in the first section, MIMOX provides a simple interface for ClustalW[19] to align a set of mimotope sequences. this is implemented as the script mimocs.pl. the script mimosa.pl wraps JalView to view and manage the alignment. the script mimocs.pl derives a consensus sequence from the alignment. the second section also has 3 perl scripts. in MIMOX, there are five similar residue groups (L, I, V; T, S; E, D; Q, N; K, R; F, W); other residues are considered unique. this classification scheme is the same as that used by Mapitope[16,17]. two matching modes are available at present. one is strict mode, which means the type of mimotope residue must match the antigen residue exactly. another is conservative mode, which means similar residues are also included in the candidate residue array. y2, z2, x1, y1, z1 are coordinates of atom 2 and atom 1. default distance threshold is 7.0 angstroms, as it approximates upper limit for noncovalent interactions in macromolecular structures[23]. cases using monoclonal antibodies are most appropriate for testing[15]. the first case is taken from FINDMAP[13]. the side chain of some amino acids (such as arginine) can span a distance as great as 12. MIMOX takes this value as the maximum allowable distance. this distance restriction is also used by Mapitope[16,17]. mapitope derived a consensus sequence from 17b mimotopes. the top result is I423, K421, I420, and R419. mapitope gives more complete and elaborate result. the top candidate residue cluster suggested by MIMOX is L86, V85, T244, S243, N229, K231, and E267. it is composed of the residues: L452 L453 T283 T455 N280 K282 D279 and has an even larger accessible surface area, 562.89. tope is predicted to be composed of a segment YFTNMF (2195\u20132200) and residues T2202, K2207, R2215, R2215, R2220, Q2222. the structure of human coagulation factor VIII in complex with BO2C11 has been solved [PDB: 1IQD] MIMOX lists all the matched results with no prediction threshold. the true epitope often falls in the top 5 (if the there are only a few result entries) or top 10% (if the there are many result entries) of the results. mapitope deconvolutes a set of mimotope sequences into a set of overlapping amino acids pairs (AAP) then a set of major statistically significant pairs (SSP) are identified based on the AAP. the most elaborate clusters on the antigen surface are identified and regarded as the predicted epitope candidates. a new version of MIMOX with more user definable options and supporting multiple-chain antigens will be implemented in the future. a systematic evaluation and comparison study with all available tools including MIMOX that assist phage display based epitope mapping is also under consideration. cases using monoclonal antibodies are most appropriate for testing[15]. more case studies can be found on the test dataset page of MIMOX[25]. the need for the higher distance threshold is due to R372 which lies some distance from the other mapped residues. cluster 26 (V96, P98, H101, P102, T103, W356, M355, R372) has 3 sequential segments, i.e. VPHPT, WM, and R. RT X [-R], from 17b mimotopes, finds no result matching the whole consensus sequence. the top result is I423, K421, I420, and R419; the 4th result is V200, K121, L122, and K121; the 5th result is V200, K121, L122, and K121. the top result from conservative mode is shown in image B. it is composed of the residues: L452 L453 T283 T455 N280 K282 D279 and has a 265.82 2 solvent accessible surface. the last case is taken from MIMOP[15]. the BO2C11 epitope has been recorded in the CED database as CE0176. using default parameters, MIMOX derived a consensus sequence of [NQKR] [HST] RWSNRSS [ST] from those mimotopes. the top 3 results overlap with the MIMOP result and the native BO2C11 epitope well. the true epitope (or its segments) often falls in the top 5 (if the there are only a few result entries) or top 10% (if the there are many result entries) of the results. some groups have researched algorithms that may assist and automate phage display based epitope mapping. mapitope deconvolutes a set of mimotope sequences into overlapping amino acids pairs (AAP) then a set of major statistically significant pairs (SSP) are identified based on the AAP. the most elaborate and diverse clusters on the antigen surface are identified and regarded as the predicted epitope candidates[16,17]. a new version of MIMOX with more user definable options will be implemented in the future. a systematic evaluation and comparison study with all available tools including MIMOX that assist phage display based epitope mapping is also under consideration.
