{"summary": "a new human coronavirus, MERS-CoV, was isolated from a man with pneumonia and renal failure in 2012. as of 21 November 2014, the WHO confirmed 909 MERS cases, in which 36% of patients died (8). the hydrophobic region forms one amphipathic -helix that oligomerizes and displays ion channel activity (20\u201322). the protein is present in small amounts within viral particles but is abundantly synthesized in infected cells (23\u201325), where it localizes in the endoplasmic reticulum Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), participating in virus morphogenesis and budding (25\u201327). T cell responses play a crucial role in SARS-CoV clearance and in protection from clinical disease (50\u201352). rSARS-CoV Urbani strain virus causes no significant disease in wild-type (wt) mice (57), which reproduced many aspects of the human disease. mice infected with the less pathogenic viruses protected against the challenge with the virulent wt virus. mice were purchased from the national cancer institute at the age of 6 or 16 weeks or from Harlan Laboratories (Holland) at the age of 8 weeks. cDNA encoding the genome of the SARS-CoV-MA15 strain was assembled in a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) cDNA fragments containing nucleotides (nt 26044 to 26779 of the SARS-CoV genome were generated by overlap extension PCR in the case of the carboxy-terminal mutants. psl1190+BamHI/SacII SARS-CoV contains a fragment corresponding to nucleotides 26045 to 30091 of the SARS-CoV infectious cDNA clone (59) using unique BamHI and SacII restriction sites. pBAC-SARS-CoV-MA15-E* plasmids were cloned by three rounds of plaque purification. subconfluent monolayers (90% confluence) of Vero E6 or Huh7.5.1 cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001 with rSARS-CoV-MA15-E*, rSARS-CoV-MA15-E, or rSARS-CoV-MA15-E. rSARS-CoV-MA15, rSARS-CoV-MA15-E, and rSARS-CoV-MA15-E* cells were grown to 70% confluence on glass coverslips. at 24 h postinfection, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. rSARS-CoV-MA15-E* mutants were infected with wt or rSARS-CoV-MA15-E* virus at an MOI of 0.3. at 8 hpi, the culture medium was harvested and replaced with fresh medium supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) cDNAs were generated using a high-capacity cDNA transcription kit. blots were probed with rabbit polyclonal Ab specific for hemagglutinin (HA) tag. blots were quantitated by phosphorimaging. half-life of each E protein mutant was calculated by plotting signal intensity. a DNA fragment encoding the SARS-CoV M protein was generated using as the template the plasmid pBAC-SARS-CoV-MA15-E*. plasmids were digested by restriction enzymes EcoRI and XhoI and cloned into pcDNA3-E. monoclonal anti-HA agarose conjugate was incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. immuno complexes were eluted using 20 l 2 SDS sample buffer and heating at 95\u00b0C for 3 min. mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and intranasally inoculated with 1 105 PFU of virus. qPCRs were performed using the high-capacity cDNA transcription kit (Applied Biosystems) to generate cDNAs. qPCRs were performed at 37\u00b0C for 2 h using the high-capacity cDNA transcription kit. Lungs from infected mice were collected at 2 days postinfection (p.i.) total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen) total RNA from three different lungs was independently hybridized for each transcriptomic comparison. the expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), MCP-1/CCL2, KC/CXCL1, IL-5, IL-6, IL-13, IFN-, macrophage inflammatory protein 1 (MIP-1)/CCL3 and MIP-1/CCL4 was determined as previously described (58, 58). cytoplasmic and extracellular proteins were extracted using a nuclear extract kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA) mice were purchased from the national cancer institute at the age of 6 or 16 weeks or from Harlan Laboratories (Holland) at the age of 8 weeks. all experiments involving SARS-CoV were conducted in biosafety level 3 laboratories in the animal care facility at the university of Iowa or at the center for animal health research. pBAC-SARS-CoV-MA15 plasmid contains a fragment corresponding to nucleotides 26045 to 30091 of the SARS-CoV infectious cDNA clone (59) these fragments were inserted into pBAC-SARS-CoV-MA15 to generate pBAC-SARS-CoV-MA15-E* plasmids. the virus was cloned by three rounds of plaque purification. 2 mutant, 24

CGCGAGTTACATGGCTCTACTCGCG 2 E-SARS subconfluent monolayers (90% confluence) of Vero E6 or Huh7.5.1 cells were infected with rSARS-CoV-MA15-E*, rSARS-CoV-MA15-E, or rSARS-CoV-MA15-E* at an MOI of 0.3. at 24 h postinfection, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. antibodies specific for rabbit or mice species conjugated to Alexa 488 (for detection of E protein) or Alexa 594 (for detection of ERGIC), respectively (dilution of 1:500; Invitrogen), were incubated for 45 min at room temperature. slides were examined on a leica SP5 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems) rSARS-CoV-MA15-E* mutants were infected with the wt or rSARS-CoV-MA15-E* virus at an MOI of 0.3. at 12 hpi, the cells were treated with 200 g/ml cycloheximide (Sigma) samples were harvested at 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 h. the blots were quantitated by phosphorimaging. the half-life of each E protein mutant was calculated by plotting the signal intensity (ratio of band intensity) pcDNA3-HA-M cells were grown to 90% confluence and cotransfected with a plasmid encoding an N-terminal HA-tagged M protein (pcDNA3-HA-M) cells cotransfected with the plasmid pcDNA3-HA-M and empty plasmid pcDNA3-E were used as controls. rSARS-CoV-MA15 titers were measured in vero E6 cells. titers were expressed as PFU/g tissue. mice were intranasally inoculated with 1 105 PFU of the virus.

expression over replicates using an empirical Bayes moderated t statistic (64). the expected false discovery rate was controlled to be less than 5%. a set of mutant viruses (rSARS-CoV-MA15-E*) were generated. a set of mutant viruses (rSARS-CoV-MA15-E*) were generated. rSARS-CoV-MA15-E* was modified by introducing point mutations. maximum viral titers were observed at 48 to 72 hpi in vero E6 and at 72 hpi in Huh7.5.1-infected cells. mutant viruses grew to titers similar to those of rSARS-CoV-MA15-E. deletion of SARS-CoV E protein regions 2, 3, and 5 reduced virus growth. the expanded region shows the E protein sequence and its different regions. white boxes represent the amino acids deleted within the E protein in each virus. wt, E, and rSARS-CoV-MA15-E* viruses were infected at an MOI of 0.001. 6 cells followed by sequencing of the distal third of the genome. only minor changes were detected in the viral sequences of one representative isolate, suggesting that these viruses were in general genetically stable, at least in tissue culture. no significant differences in the production of infectious viruses were observed among the passaged and the original viruses. mice infected with rSARS-CoV-MA15-E* showed no signs of disease. mice infected with 2, 3, 5, and E viruses showed no signs of disease. mice infected with the mutants lost 15% and 10% of their initial weight. parental virus showed highest titers, 8 107 PFU/g of lung tissue at day 2 and 5 107 PFU/g at day 4. rSARS-CoV-MA15-6 grew to 7 107 PFU/g at 2 days p.i. and 107 PFU/g at 4 days p.i. coV-MA15-E* attenuation, macroscopic and microscopic changes in the lungs of infected mice were analyzed at 2 and 4 days p.i. the lungs from animals infected with the wt or 6 viruses but not E, Mut 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 viruses were increased in volume and were dusky red. the specific infectivities of rSARS-CoV-MA15-E mutants were lower (21%, 11%, and 17%, respectively) than that of the wt virus. the specific infectivities of rSARS-CoV-MA15-E mutants were lower (21%, 11%, and 17%, respectively) than that of the wt virus. the ratio of infectious virus titer (PFU/ml) to genomic RNA is depicted in the graph as percentage of specific infectivity. bars represent standard deviations of the mean (n = 3 mice) interactions between SARS-CoV E and M proteins play an essential role in the viral particle assembly (66\u201368) rSARS-CoV-MA15-3 and -5 viruses grew to lower titers than those for wt virus in cell cultures. an HA-tagged, full-length M protein and E-3 deletion protein were coexpressed together with the M protein, using an antibody specific for the HA tag fused to the M protein. leukocyte infiltrates in lungs of mice infected with virulent rSARS-CoV-MA15-wt or representative attenuated mutants were quantified and characterized by flow cytometry. higher total and relative levels of macrophages were observed in lung infiltrates of mice infected with the attenuated viruses. rSARS-CoV-MA15-E*-infected mice were intranasally infected with 1 105 PFU of the indicated SARS-CoV deletion mutants. the total number of leukocytes (A) and numbers and percentages of macrophages (B), neutrophils (C), CD4+ T cells (D) and CD8+ T cells (E) were determined. the most statistically significant clusters were associated with the immune response, the response to wounding, and the inflammatory response. the genes downregulated in mice infected with the attenuated rSARS-CoV-MA15 mutants were involved mainly in inflammation. this reduction correlated with relative increase in expression of the Th2 genes, such as those encoding IL-4 and IL-13. analysis of host gene expression using mouse microarraysa Comparison Total no. of genes differentially expressed No. of upregulated

levels of rRNA 18S and transforming growth factor (TGF-) were the same in all mice. expression of mRNAs encoding inflammatory genes (A) and immune response and IFN response genes encoding TGF and 18S rRNA (B) was measured by qRT-PCR. macroscopic and microscopic inflammation present in the lungs of infected mice correlated with overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines and downregulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines. mice were mock infected with 1 105 PFU of rSARS-CoV-MA15-wt, -3, -5, or -E virus or were mock infected (mock) vaccination with the attenuated mutant viruses completely protected mice from the lethal dose of rSARS-CoV-MA15. mice were mock immunized or immunized with 1 105 PFU of the rSARS-CoV-MA15-E* mutants. weight loss and survival (B) were recorded daily. Mutant E* and wt proteins were similarly localized within infected cells. all the mutant E proteins partially colocalized with the ERGIC marker as previously observed for the full-length protein (25). these data indicated that none of the regions deleted were essential for the subcellular localization of E protein. deletion of SARS-CoV E protein regions 2, 3, and 5 reduced virus growth to the same extent that the deletion of full-length E protein did, suggesting that these regions themselves were essential for E protein function. in a subsequent experiment, we studied the 3 and 5 viruses because viruses grew to titers similar to those of rSARS-CoV-MA15-E. rSARS-CoV-MA15-E* mutants were passaged daily 8 times in vero E6 cells. only minor changes were detected in the viral sequences of one representative isolate. stability of rSARS-CoV-MA15-E* mutants was examined. mice were mock infected or infected with rSARS-CoV-MA15-E*, rSARS-CoV-MA15-E, and rSARS-CoV-MA15-E. clinical disease and survival were evaluated for 10 days. mice infected with the parental virus showed disease symptoms from 2 days p.i., reflected by lethargy and ruffled fur. these mice rapidly lost weight, and 80% of them died by day rSARS-CoV-MA15-6 grew to 7 107 PFU/g at 2 days p.i. and 5 107 PFU/g at 4 days p.i. rSARS-CoV-MA15-6 grew to 7 107 PFU/g at 2 days p.i. and 107 PFU/g at 4 days p.i. rSARS-CoV-MA15-E*-infected mice were intranasally inoculated with 1 105 PFU of the indicated viruses. at 2 and 4 days p.i., lung tissue was harvested and viral titers were analyzed in vero E6 cell monolayers. macroscopic and microscopic changes in the lungs of infected mice were analyzed at 2 and 4 days p.i. BALB/c mice were intranasally inoculated with 1 105 PFU of the indicated SARS-CoV deletion mutants and sacrificed at days 2 and 4 p.i. (A) Lungs were removed and sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. vero E6 cells were independently infected with each of the rSARS-CoV-MA15-E, -3, and -5 and wt viruses, at an MOI of 0.3. at 8 hpi, the culture medium was harvested and replaced with fresh medium supplemented with 2% FBS. the levels of genomic RNA and infectious virus titer were analyzed. at 12 hpi, the cells were treated with cycloheximide. the amount of E protein mutants was determined by Western blotting. bars represent standard deviation of the mean (n = 3 mice) cotransfections of a plasmid encoding HA-M protein and a plasmid without E protein were used as controls. cells were lysed and analyzed with specific antibodies for the E protein and HA. the presence of E and M proteins was analyzed in the precipitated fractions using the monoclonal HA-specific antibody. higher total and relative numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were present in the lungs of E, 3, and 5 virus-infected mice. all data analyzed were statistically significant, with exception of total leukocyte, neutrophil, and CD4+ numbers. these data suggested that mice infected with the attenuated viruses develop higher T cell responses than those infected with virulent SARS-CoV. rSARS-CoV-MA15-E, rSARS-CoV-MA15-3, rSARS-CoV-MA15-5, and mock-infected lungs were compared using mouse microarrays. the most statistically significant clusters were associated with the immune response, the response to wounding, the defense response, and the inflammatory response. genes differentially expressed in E-, 3-, and 5-infected mice compared to in wt-infected mice were classified according to their main biological functions. black and gray lettering is used to indicate up- and downregulated genes, respectively. the expression of the Th2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 was upregulated in the lungs of mice infected with the wt virus. mRNA levels of rRNA 18S and transforming growth factor (TGF-) encoded by another gene involved in the anti-inflammatory response were the same in all mice. the levels of TNF, CCL2, CXCL1, IL-5, IL-6, IL-13, IFN-, CCL3 and CCL4 were evaluated in lung extracts from mice infected with the rSARS-CoV-MA15, 3, 5 and E viruses. all cytokine differences at the protein level were statistically significant, with minor exceptions in CCL3, CXCL1 and CCL4 cytokines. groups of mice were either mock immunized with PBS or immunized with the Mut 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 attenuated viruses. at 21 days postimmunization, mice were challenged with rSARS-CoV-MA15. weight loss and mortality were monitored for 14 days postchallenge. all the nonimmunized mice lost weight and died by day 7 after rSARS-CoV-MA15 challenge. infection of mice with rSARS-CoV-MA15-Mut 1, -2, -3, -4, -5, and -E mutants led to decreased lung pathology compared to that of wt-infected mice. the deletion within rSARS-CoV-MA15-6 includes the PDZ-binding motif (73, 74) the interaction between E and M proteins necessary for virus morphogenesis (66\u201368) was preserved despite deleting the 3 region. the specific infectivity of the different small deletions within the E protein was lower (6-fold) than that of the wt virus. however, these viruses caused a reduction in lung inflammation and pathology. the expression of the Th2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 was increased in asymptomatic young BALB/c mice infected with a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV. the lower proinflammatory cytokine expression and higher anti-inflammatory cytokine levels observed after infection with the attenuated mutants could account for diminished lung pathology and virus attenuation. an increase in neutrophil numbers in conjunction with a decrease in macrophage numbers in the lungs is associated with more severe SARS-CoV pathogenesis. the deletion of E protein carboxy-terminal regions was responsible for these changes in the phenotype of infiltrating immune cells and virus attenuation during infection. however, low T cell counts correlate with adverse outcomes in SARS patients. introducing additional attenuating mutations into the protein to generate a safer vaccine candidate. the gene was selected as a target because it is located at a very distant site from that of the E gene in the viral genome. this makes the generation of a virulent virus through single recombination events with circulating coronaviruses unlikely."}
