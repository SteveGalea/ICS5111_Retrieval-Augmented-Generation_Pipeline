{"summary": "interplay between IFN-, IL-17 and neutrophils during CNS inflammatory disease is complex due to cross-regulatory factors affecting both positive and negative feedback loops. these interactions have hindered the ability to distinguish relative contributions of neutrophils, Th1 and Th17 cell-derived effector molecules from secondary mediators to tissue damage and morbidity. IL-17 mediates detrimental clinical consequences in an IFN--deprived environment. results also suggest that IFN- overrides the detrimental IL-17 effector responses via a mechanism downstream of transcriptional regulation. IL-17 and IFN- play diverse and often opposing functions during microbial infections, as well as autoimmune diseases. the coemergence of Th17 and Th1 cells has recently been documented in several infections, including human immunodeficiency virus [9], simian immunodeficiency virus [10] and cytomegalovirus [11]. a deleterious role of IL-17 is implied by acute lung injury associated with IL-17-mediated neutrophil recruitment during influenza virus infection [13]. mice are susceptible to EAE [22], adoptive transfer of polarized encephalitogenic CD4+ T cells support Th17 cells as detrimental participants in EAE [23,24] pathogenic mechanisms associated with Th17 cells remain an ongoing challenge and may involve multiple pathways. these include excessive CNS neutrophil infiltration and release of degrading enzymes, free radicals and pro-inflammatory cytokines, and direct IL-17-mediated neuronal toxicity [25]. mortality was related to immune effector functions specific to CD4+ T cells and controlled by IFN-. infected recipients of wild-type (WT) CD4+ T cells infected with JHMV were characterized by extensive neutrophil accumulation and IL-17 expression. SCID mice were injected in the left hemisphere with 30 l volume containing 500 PFU of JHMV diluted in endotoxin-free Dulbecco\u2019s modified PBS. severity of the disease was graded as follows: 0, healthy; 1, ruffled fur and hunched back; 2, partial hind limb paralysis or inability to turn to the upright position. erythrin- (PE) labeled anti-CD8 (clone 53-6.7) and peridinin chlorophyll protein- (PerCP) labeled anti-CD19 (clone 1D3) mAbs. recipients received 5 106 donor CD4+ T cells composed of 100% Thy1.1 (WT), 100% GKO or a 50/50% mixture of Thy1.1/GKO CD4+ T cells. cell pellets were resuspended in RPMI containing 25 mM HEPES. a 1 ml underlay of 70% Percoll was added prior to centrifugation. cells were then stained with anti-mouse CD16/CD32 (clone 2.4G2) mAb. cDNAs were prepared using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo (dT)12\u201318 primers (Invitrogen) semi-quantitative RNA expression was assessed using lightCycler and SYBR Green kit. TaqMan primers and 2X TaqMan fast master mix were used to assess CXCL1 and CCL2 mRNA levels. levels of mRNA expression were normalized using Ct method as previously described. IL-17 (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and hamster anti-mouse CD3 primary mAbs (Serotec) were added for 1 hour at room temperature. sections were mounted with Vectashield mounting medium with 4\u2019-6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) the two-tailed unpaired Student\u2019s t-test was calculated using the two-tailed unpaired Student\u2019s t-test. the differences were considered significant. supernatants were stored at 70\u00b0C. pellets containing CNS-derived cells were suspended in percoll. donor splenocytes were prepared four to sixteen weeks post immunization. injections of 500 g of anti-Ly-6G (clone 1A8) or anti-Gr1 (clone RB6-8C5) mAb every other day until sacrifice, starting two days before infection. no differences in survival relative to control-treated mice were observed following either neutrophil-depleting mAb. s were stained with FITC-, PE-, PerCP- or allophycocyanin-conjugated mAb for 30 minutes on ice in PBS containing 0.1% BSA. cDNAs were prepared using TRIzoL reagent (Invitrogen) and oligo (dT)12\u201318 primers (Invitrogen) GM-CSF: F: 5\u2019- TTTCCTCTGTGTGTGTGTGT-3\u2019, R: 5\u2019- ACACATGTGTGTGTGTGT-3\u2019, R: 5\u2019- ACACATGTGTGTGTGTGTGT-3\u2019, IL-6: F: 5\u2019- ACACATGTGTGTGTGTGTGT-3\u2019, R: 5\u2019- AAGTGCATCATCATCATCATCAT-3\u2019, IL-6: F: 5\u2019- GACGGCATTGT taqMan primers and 2X TaqMan fast master mix were used to assess CXCL1 and CCL2 mRNA levels. levels of mRNA expression were normalized to ubiquitin mRNA. cytokine production from both splenic cultures or ex vivo lymph node cells was measured following four hours stimulation with PMA (10 ng/ml) and ionomycin (1 M) was added to the cultures for the last two hours. cells were harvested and stained for surface expression of CD4. IFN- mRNA expression in WT CD4+ T cell recipients was associated with sparse CXCL1 expression and neutrophil recruitment. low IFN- mRNA expression in both GKO CD4+ T cell recipients and infected SCID controls correlated with high CXCL1 expression. efficiency of neutrophil (CD45hi Ly6G+, R4 region) depletion after antibody treatment analyzed by flow cytometry in the CNS of SCID recipients of GKO CD4+ T cells at day eight p.i. density plots are representative of eight animals per group. filtration, approaching the numbers found in GKO CD4+ T cell recipients, reassert abundant CNS neutrophils are insufficient to account for early mortality. IL-17 mediates mortality, independent of neutrophils, compared to WT CD4+ T cell recipients. passive transfer of neutralizing anti-TNF mAb was unable to alter the mortality of the GKO CD4+ T cell recipients. these results suggested additional factor(s) intrinsic to GKO CD4+ T cells in mediating disease outcome. inhibition of IL-17 production by IFN- [37], suggested IL-17 as a potential candidate. IL-17 production by CD4+ T cells in the CNS of GKO recipients was confirmed by immunofluorescence histochemistry. only 8% of T cells in the cervical lymph nodes of GKO recipients secreted IL-17 at day eight p.i. the increased neutrophil infiltration in the CNS of GKO recipients was not altered by anti-IL-17 treatment. IL-6 and IL-1 (A), IL-17 (B), and IL-22 and IL-21 (C) mRNA expression analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR in brains of nave. survival was assessed daily in infected SCID recipients of WT (n = 8), WT + anti-IL-17 mAb (n = 12), GKO (n = 8) and GKO + anti-IL-17 mAb (n = 12) CD4+ T cells until day 18 p.i. increased mRNA expression correlated with MHC class II protein expression by the majority of microglia in both WT and co-transfer groups. disease severity was similar in WT and WT/GKO recipients and significantly reduced compared to GKO-only recipients. microglial MHC class II expression quantified by flow cytometry in infected SCID recipients of WT, WT/GKO or GKO CD4+ T cells. survival was assessed following infection of SCID recipients of WT (n = 20), WT/GKO (n = 20) or GKO (n = 12) CD4+ T cells. protection mediated by IFN-, despite elevated IL-17, suggested that IFN- interferes with IL-17-mediated signaling events, rather than directly influencing Th17 expression. exogenous IFN- was indeed unable to downregulate IL-17 production. data represent means (SD) of twelve mice per group combined from three separate experiments. IL-17 mRNA expression determined by quantitative real-time PCR in infected SCID recipients of WT, WT/GKO or GKO CD4+ T cells. no significant difference in CXCL2 mRNA was found comparing SCID-infected controls and recipients of either WT or GKO CD4+ T cells. mMP9, MMP3 and MMP12 mRNA expression were also upregulated in GKO recipients compared to infected SCID controls and WT recipients. GM-CSF expression correlated with IFN- deficiency, but not with an IL-17 mediated feedback loop. mRNA expression analyzed in the CNS of nave mice, controls, and SCID recipients of WT or GKO CD4+ T cells at day eight p.i. infected mice were depleted of neutrophils to explore a possible correlation between neutrophil-derived proteases, free radicals and proinflammatory cytokines with virus-induced mortality. the absence of neutrophils did not prevent early mortality of GKO CD4+ T cell SCID recipients. efficiency of neutrophil (CD45hi Ly6G+, R4 region) depletion after antibody (Ab) treatment analyzed in the CNS of SCID recipients of GKO CD4+ T cells at day eight p.i. Density plots are representative of eight animals per group. IL-17 mediates mortality, independent of neutrophils. previous data demonstrated that TNF and inducible nitric oxide synthase were not associated with early mortality of GKO recipients. inhibition of IL-17 production by IFN- [37], suggested IL-17 as a potential candidate. consistent with this concept, IL-17 mRNA expression was increased in the CNS of GKO CD4+ T cell recipients. IL-17 mRNA expression was increased in the CNS of infected WT mice lacking T cells, although IL-17 is not expressed in the CNS of infected WT mice. in the CNS of GKO recipients was confirmed by immunofluorescence histochemistry. only 8% of T cells in the cervical lymph nodes of GKO recipients secreted IL-17 at day eight p.i. cytokine expression was analyzed in the memory CD4+ T cells capable of producing IL-17. IL-17 expression was measured in infected SCID recipients of GKO CD4+ T cells. mRNA expression was measured by quantitative real-time PCR in brains of nave (n = 4), infected control (n = 3), infected SCID recipients of WT (n = 4). data are mean from two separate experiments. n = 4, untreated mice and n = 8, anti-IL-17-treated mice per experiment. increased mRNA expression correlated with MHC class II protein expression by the majority of microglia in both WT and co-transfer groups. disease severity was similar in WT and WT/GKO recipients and significantly reduced compared to GKO-only recipients. data represent the mean SD of three separate experiments. survival was assessed following infection of SCID recipients of WT (n = 20), WT/GKO (n = 20) or GKO (n = 12) CD4+ T cells. protection mediated by IFN-, despite elevated IL-17, suggested that IFN- interferes with IL-17-mediated signaling events, rather than directly influencing Th17 expression. exogenous IFN- was indeed unable to downregulate IL-17 production. IL-17 mRNA expression determined by quantitative real-time PCR in infected SCID recipients of WT, WT/GKO or GKO CD4+ T cells. data represent mean of two experiments with n = 4 in each group per experiment. no significant difference in mRNA was found comparing SCID-infected controls and recipients of either WT or GKO CD4+ T cells. GM-CSF expression was increased in GKO recipients relative to controls and recipients of either WT or GKO CD4+ T cells. changes in chemokines, MMPs and GM-CSF mRNA do not correlate with IL-17-mediated mortality. mRNA expression measured in the CNS of nave mice, infected control mice and SCID recipients of WT or GKO CD4+ T cells. ade of either neutrophils or IL-17 showed early mortality did not correlate with CNS neutrophil recruitment, but rather with IL-17. neutrophil depletion following severe influenza virus infection also suggests that neutrophils play a protective, rather than a deleterious role. identical viral burden at day eight p.i. in all recipients indicated IL-17 does not alter control of virus replication. increased gray matter infection, especially in neuronal cells, is associated with premature death following JHMV infection. recipients treated with anti-IL17 did not correlate with a decrease in GM-CSF expression. the data do not support a pathogenic role of GM-CSF in early mortality of JHMV-infected GKO recipients. IL-27 suppressive function on Th17 differentiation from nave CD4+ T cells could not be reproduced on memory Th17 cells [60]. the prolonged survival of co-transferred recipients suggests that IFN- overcomes the deleterious effects of IL-17. but the mechanisms by which IFN- overrides IL-17 function remain unclear.
