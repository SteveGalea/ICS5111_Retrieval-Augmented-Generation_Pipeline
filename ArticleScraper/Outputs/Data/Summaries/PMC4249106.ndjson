{"summary": "six human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been identified to date. four of them (HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1) are thought to be responsible for 30% of common cold cases. MERS-CoV causes life-threatening pneumonia and renal failure. downregulation of ACE2 protein levels may lead to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome. HCoV-NL63 can be cultured in monkey epithelial cell lines that endogenously express ACE2 (e.g., LLC-Mk2, Vero E6, or Vero B4 cells) adhesion of HCoV-NL63 to heparin sulfate proteoglycans enhances viral infection. HCoV-NL63 nucleic acids were isolated from cell culture supernatants using a total RNA mini-preps super kit. 293T cells (ATCC CRL-3216) were transfected with the pLKO.1-TRC-ACE2 plasmid using polyethylenimine (PEI; Sigma-Aldrich, Poland) at 24 h posttransfection, the cells were washed with sterile 1 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and cultured at 37\u00b0C for 48 h in medium supplemented with puromycin (2 g m cells were infected with 1 ml of generated retroviruses in the presence of Polybrene (5 g ml1; Sigma-Aldrich) after 24 h of incubation, the cells were cultured in medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 U ml1), streptomycin (100 g ml1), ciprofloxacin (5 g ml1), and G4 HCoV-NL63-permissive LLC-Mk2 cells were exposed to the virus at a TCID50 ml1 of 400. unbound viruses were removed by washing with sterile 1 PBS. samples of cell culture supernatant were collected every 24 h for 6 days. the virus stock was concentrated 25-fold using centrifugal protein concentrators. layered onto a 15% iodixanol solution in 1 PBS. resulting virus-containing fractions were aliquoted and stored at 80\u00b0C. the conditions were as follows: 3 min at 95\u00b0C, 40 cycles (30 cycles for nested PCR) of 30 s at 95\u00b0C, 30 s at 47\u00b0C, and 25 s at 72\u00b0C, followed by 5 min at 72\u00b0C and 10 min at 4\u00b0C. the cells were then centrifuged and resuspended in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer. samples were centrifuged (10 min at 12,000 g) and cell debris was discarded. total protein concentration of each sample was quantified using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method. resulting supernatants were mixed with sample buffer. mouse anti-actin antibody (50 ng ml1; BD Biosciences, USA) and horseradish peroxidase-labeled rabbit anti-mouse IgG (65 ng ml1; Dako, Denmark) were used for detection of -actin. all antibodies were diluted in 1% skimmed milk plus TBS-Tween (0.1%) cells were washed with 1 PBS, scraped from plates, and incubated for 2 h. cells were then washed, resuspended in 1 PBS, and analyzed by flow cytometry. cells were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with mouse anti-NL63-N IgG (0.25 g ml1; Ingenansa, Spain), followed by 1 h of incubation with goat anti-mouse IgG. nuclear DNA staining was performed with 4\u2032,6\u2032-diamidino-2-phenylindole ([DAPI] 0.1 g ml1; Sigma-Aldrich, Poland). LLC-Mk2 cells were seeded in six-well plates (TPP, Switzerland) and incubated with sugar monomers for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. adherence of iodixanol-concentrated HCoV-NL63 was examined. human 293T (ATCC CRL-3216; kidney epithelial cells) and A549 (ATCC CCL-185; lung carcinoma cells) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's MEM (Life Technologies, Poland) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Poland), penicillin (100 U ml1), streptomycin (100 g ml1), and ciprofloxacin (5 g ml Dulbecco's MEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 U ml1), streptomycin (100 g ml1), ciprofloxacin (5 g ml1) and puromycin (1 g ml1). ACE2-expressing A549 cells were generated using retroviral vectors based on a Moloney murine leukemia virus system. HCoV-NL63 stock (isolate Amsterdam 1) was generated by infecting monolayers of LLC-Mk2 cells. cells were then lysed by two freeze-thaw cycles at 6 days postinfection. cytopathic effect (CPE) was scored by observation under an inverted microscope. DNA was amplified in a 10-l reaction mixture containing 1 TaqMan PCR master mix. probes labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) and 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) primers were used for HCoV-NL63 amplification. total nucleic acids were isolated from virus- and mock-infected cells at 5 days p.i. using a total RNA mini-Preps Super kit. cDNA was amplified in a 20-l reaction mixture containing 1 Dream Taq Green PCR master mix. the conditions were as follows: 3 min at 95\u00b0C, 40 cycles (30 cycles for nested PCR) of 30 s at 95\u00b0C, 30 s at 47\u00b0C, and 25 s at 72\u00b0C. the PCR products were run on 1% agarose gels (1 Tris-acetate EDTA [TAE] buffer. the cells were then centrifuged and resuspended in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer a goat anti-human ACE2 ectodomain antibody and horseradish peroxidase-labeled rabbit anti-mouse IgG were used to detect the ACE2 protein in human cell lysates and cell supernatants. all antibodies were diluted in 1% skimmed milk plus TBS-Tween (0.1%). cells were seeded in six-well plates (TPP, Switzerland) and stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate ([PMA] 1 M; Sigma-Aldrich, Poland) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. cells were then washed with 1 PBS, fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde (PFA), permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 1 PBS, and incubated for 1 h with cells were seeded on coverslips in six-well plates, cultured for 2 days at 37\u00b0C. cells were then washed with 1 PBS, fixed with 3% PFA, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 1 PBS, and incubated for 1 h with 5% BSA\u20130.5% Tween 20 in 1 PBS. images were acquired using a leica TCS SP5 II confocal microscope. images were deconvolved with Huygens Essential package. Viruses attached to the cell were quantified using a three-dimensional (3D) object counter plug-in for ImageJ (30) with the histogram threshold set to 80. ixanol-concentrated HCoV-NL63 was incubated with tested compounds for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. unbound virus was removed by washing with 1 PBS, and fresh medium containing HS was added to each well. samples of cell culture supernatant were collected at 6 days postinfection. ACE2 acts as a receptor for HCoV-NL63 and is sufficient to enable infectious entry. both ACE2+ and WT A549 and 293T cells were infected with HCoV-NL63. infection resulted in clear CPE at 3 days p.i.; no CPE was observed in HCoV-NL63-infected A549_WT cells. HCoV-NL63 nucleocapsid protein was detected in ACE2+ cells. ACE2+ and WT 293T and A549 cells were infected with HCoV-NL63. no signal from the NL63-N protein was observed in mock-infected cells. ACE2-overexpressing and wild-type cells were infected with HCoV-NL63 (+) or mock infected () and cultured for 6 days. no HCoV-NL63 sgmRNAs were detected in WT cells. LLC-Mk2 cells infected with HCoV-NL63 (+) or mock infected () were used as controls. a steep rise in viral copies in the culture medium was observed on day 3 p.i. no CPE or significant increase in viral yield was observed in 293T_WT/ACE2+ cells. a set of experiments to determine whether ACE2 serves as an attachment factor for HCoV-NL63 was performed. LLC-Mk2 cells were depleted of surface ACE2 protein by incubation with 1 M PMA. HCoV-NL63 replication on LLC-Mk2 ACE2+ and ACE2 cells was evaluated. a significant decrease in viral replication was observed on LLC-Mk2 cells pretreated with PMA compared to control cells. a representative image is presented in Fig. 6D, which confirms that ACE2 shedding does not affect HCoV-NL63 binding to the cell surface. to this end, HCoV-NL63 replication was analyzed in cells preincubated with C. perfringens type V neuraminidase, which shows a broad specificity for sialic acid-containing substrates (32). d-(+)-galactose, d-(+)-mannose, d-(+)-N-acetylglucosamine, and l-()-fucose were used in virus adhesion experiments on LLC-Mk2 cells. a soluble HS was used to assess whether attachment of HCoV-NL63 is mediated by these molecules. ACE2 protein was removed from surface of LLC-Mk2 cells by incubation with 1 M PMA (ACE2) and control cells were treated with DMSO (ACE2+) adhesion of HCoV-NL63 was assessed on ACE2+ and ACE2 cells in the presence of heparan sulfate (HS) no difference between ACE2+ and ACE2 cells was noted. Flow cytometry results were further confirmed by confocal microscopy. preincubation of the virus with HS results in a dose-dependent decline in virus replication. a549_ACE2+, A549_WT, 293T_ACE2+, and 293T_WT cells were tested for the presence of the ACE2 protein with Western blotting using antibodies specific to the ectodomain of the human ACE2 protein. ACE2 acts as a receptor for HCoV-NL63 and is sufficient to enable infectious entry. HCoV-NL63 nucleocapsid protein was detected at 6 days p.i. in 293T_ACE2+ and A549_ACE2+ cells. no signal from the NL63-N protein was observed in mock-infected cells. HCoV-NL63 sgmRNAs were formed in A549 and 293T cells. five mRNAs encoding viral structural and accessory proteins (spike [S], ORF3 protein, envelope [E], membrane [M], and nucleocapsid [N] were present, indicating active virus replication. no replication was noted in WT cells. no increase in virus yield was observed on HCoV-NL63-infected A549 and 293T WT cells. data on virus replication are presented as the number of HCoV-NL63 RNA copies/ml. all assays were performed in triplicate, and average values with standard errors are presented. 2 cells were incubated at 4\u00b0C with gradient-purified HCoV-NL63. virus adhesion to the cell surface was examined by flow cytometry. HCoV-NL63 adherence to ACE2+ (DMSO-treated) and ACE2 (PMA-treated) was confirmed. LLC-Mk2 cells were pretreated with PMA or DMSO. HCoV-NL63 virions are presented in green, while the blue denotes DNA. each image is a single confocal plane (xy) with two orthogonal views (xz and yz) neuraminidase-treated cells were treated with DMSO (A), 1 M PMA (B) or 1 M PMA and 200 mU/ml type V neuraminidase (Neu) (C) and further incubated with purified HCoV-NL63 or mock incubated. Virus adhesion was assessed also in the presence of 50 mM sugar monomers: galactose (D), mannose (E), N-acet a soluble HS was used to assess whether attachment of HCoV-NL63 is mediated by these molecules. heparan sulfate inhibits virus attachment and entry. HCoV-NL63 adhesion to LLC-Mk2 cells was fully inhibited. m. bars represent the mean numbers of virions from 10 cells per sample standard errors. for this, virus adhesion was analyzed in the presence of HS. inhibition of virus-HS proteoglycan interaction resulted in lack of virus binding also on ACE2+ cells. HCoV-NL63 is the only alphacoronavirus to use the ACE2 protein for cellular entry. some investigators wonder why HCoV-NL63 infection manifests as life-threatening acute respiratory syndrome, while HCoV-NL63 infection results in a common cold. NL63-S-RBD may interact with ACE2; however, another stimulus may be required to expose the RBD and enable its interaction with ACE2. this would suggest a similar strategy as one employed by HIV-1 where CD4 binding by gp120 results in structural alteration of the viral protein. analysis of the S gene shows that despite in vitro propagation of the Amsterdam I strain, no new potential HS binding sites can be identified compared to those of clinical isolates. it is possible, however, that different HCoV-NL63 strains bind the HS with different affinities, which would explain the difficulty in acquiring new clinical isolates."}
