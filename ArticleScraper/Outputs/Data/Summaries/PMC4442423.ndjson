{"summary": "dicistrovirus cricket paralysis virus (CrPV) is an excellent model for the study of viral translation mechanisms and virus-host interactions. dicistrovirus cricket paralysis virus (CrPV) serves as an excellent model for the study of viral translation mechanisms and virus-host interactions, especially those related to infection in arthropods. murine gammaherpesvirus 68 ORF48 is Activated by RTA and Required for Viral Replication Herpesvirus lytic genes are expressed in a regulated cascade. ORF48 is required for viral replication in both cultured cells and laboratory mice."}
