{"summary": "the 64 codons of the genetic code encode the 20 standard amino acids. each amino acid is encoded with at least one codon (e.g., Met and Try) some amino acids are encoded with up to six codons (e.g., Leu, Ser and Arg) TTV is a small, single-stranded, negative-sense non-enveloped, circular DNA virus. it was first identified in a patient with post-transfusion hepatitis of unknown aetiology in 1997. two genetically distinct species, Torque teno sus virus 1 (TTSuV1) and 2 (TTSuV2), have been identified based on the low sequence identity between the two variants. uV2, but not of TTSuV1, was up-regulated in the pigs with PMWS [26,27]. this result was supported by Taira et al (2009), who examined animals suspected of infection with PMWS and porcine respiratory disease complex [28]. however, due to the limited number of animal species examined, the characteristics and evolution of TTSuV are not fully understood.

Statistical analysis Correlation analysis was performed to compare the relationship between nucleotide composition and synonymous codon usage pattern using Spearman\u2019s rank correlation analysis method. a phylogenetic tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining method with a bootstrap of 1000 replicates.

Discussion TTSuV is an emerging small DNA virus, widely distributed in pig-farming countries. uV2 sequences and 29 TTSuV1 sequences found no evidence for recombination between the two viruses. most frequent codons in both TTSuV2 and TTSuV1 had A or C at the third codon position. no significant relationship was found between the codon usage pattern of TTSuV2 and its host. f 1\u2019 values with respect to A%, G%, C%, GC%, A3S%, G3S%, GC3S%, GC3S%, GC3S%, GC3S%, GC3S%, GC3S%, GC3S%, GC3S% (p > 0.05) in all ENC plots, values for TTSuV2 genomes were below expected curve. genetically distinct species, TTSuV1 and TTSuV2, were distantly located in the plane defined by the first two axes of the analysis. a cluster tree analysis based on the RSCU values of TTSuV2 genomes revealed geographic factors failed to correspond to the codon usage pattern."}
