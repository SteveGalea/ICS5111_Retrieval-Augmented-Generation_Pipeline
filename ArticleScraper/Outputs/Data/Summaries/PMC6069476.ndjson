{"summary": "oil spills can be caused by people making mistakes, equipment breaking down, natural disasters, etc. the 2010 Gulf oil spill and the 2011 Bohai bay oil spill are well-known large marine oil spill events [2,3,4,5] the methods suffer from a false detection problem due to look-alikes that produce a similar signal with oil spill. for example, low-wind zones (wind speed 3 m/s), internal wave, ship wake and biogenic films have been used for oil spill detection. but it can be difficult to define standard shapes for oil spills owing to the high fluidity. the coherence between VV- and HH-polarized images is very low in oil spill areas, whereas it is very high in oil-free areas, which is close to 1. the coherence denotes the degree of correlation between two complex signals. in this study, we propose an efficient method to identify oil spill areas from co-polarized TerraSAR-X imagery. proposed method enables us to reduce false detection associated with look-alikes. the HH and VV images were provided in the single look complex format. they were obtained in five days after an oil spill accident on the descending pass. the oil tanker Volganeft-139 became stranded and within four days had spilled 2000 tons of oil into the sea. when the SAR image was obtained on 16 November 2007, the wave height and wind speed are about 2 m and 10 m/s, respectively. the ANN was learned by using pixel values of training samples from four input neurons. an NL-means filter was used to remove speckle noise that caused un-detection and false detection. in the phase texture and the coherence maps, a median filter was applied to remove ships, which were false sensing elements. process 1 generates probability map of oil spill only using intensity information of a single-polarization. NL-means filtered intensity map, normalized intensity texture map, coherence map, phase texture map were used for the process 2. the HH polarization has a high dependency on incidence angle, so as the angle increases, the intensity value of the sea decreases accordingly. this phenomenon makes the distinction between sea and oil spill more difficult in HH images [37]. the NL-means filter is applied to the computed N(x) to reduce the noise component and then used as a normalized intensity texture map. the image without the ship was obtained by applying the median filter and uses for input neuron. the standard deviation image of CPD has a high value in the oil spill region and a relatively low value in the other pixels, making it possible to reduce the false detection of biogenic film. this can be calculated using the formula [39]: = ( S h h v v * ) = h h v v, (3) ( x ) = std [ M ( ( x ) ). the NL-mean filtered intensity map is generated by three steps. the first step is applied to make the probability density function (PDF) being a Gaussian. the second step is used for the speckle reduction. however, small multi-look size is used in both azimuth and range directions. the NL-means filter is applied to the computed N(x) to reduce noise component. dVV2 is the squares of each element of difference map acquired by subtracting non-filtered VV from the filtered VV intensity image. the NL-means filter is applied to the computed N(x) to reduce the noise component. phase texture map is a standard deviation image of the CPD. the image without the ship acts as a false detection element. it is highly likely that a ship will be detected as an oil spill. a biogenic film region checked with red box still had similar pixel values to the oil spill. intensity images before and after applying non-local (NL)-means filter. the blue color line is generated using the value of image before and after filtering. the orange color line is generated using the NL-means filter\u2019s value. the blue line points are observed to be relatively lower than the orange line. the value of orange line is more effective in detecting oil spill. the map just has a correlation with some parts of oil spill, urban area and coast line. figure 6a shows the coherence image before the ship removal and Figure 6b shows the coherence image after the removal. the value of oil-free surface, as mentioned earlier, is close to 1, and oil spill area and the ship can be seen that a value closer to zero. if using the phase texture image which have been removed ship, it is possible that oil spill is accurately detected without false detection caused by look-alike and ship. the median filter was applied to the image and the signal by the ship was reduced (Figure 7c). the results of Process 1 and Process 2 show no significant difference when compared visually. a peak is observed around a probability of 0.1, which is formed by pixels corresponding to the oil-free surface. the frequency of other probabilities except the probability due to oil spill is not much different. two images showed a distinct contrast value between oil spill and oil-free ocean surface pixels. both images showed a distinct contrast value between oil spill and oil-free ocean surface pixels. sensitivity relates to non-oil spill pixels judged to be oil-free pixels. area under the curve (AUC) is the calculated value of the bottom area of the ROC curve. values less than 0.5 are considered to be worthless. images can be identified using ancillary data such as currents and winds. but some look-alikes are still difficult to distinguish from oil spills. the accuracy of detection is significantly reduced except when the oil spill has a distinctive strip shape. each image used for oil spill detection was optimized to produce a high accuracy probability from the pixel-based ANN. it is expected that the accuracy of oil spill detection can be dramatically increased with additional data, which could remove look-alike regions such as low-wind zone and rainy cell."}
