{"summary": "adult male mice (C57BL/6J, 8 wks of age, n = 146, Jackson Laboratories) received a single intracranial inoculation of MHV (A59 strain, 5,000 plaque-forming units) in 20 l PBS. the virus was propagated in the 17Cl-1 mouse fibroblast cell line followed by three cycles of freezing-thawing. animals were perfused with physiological saline solution followed by 4% paraformaldehyde solution (pH 7.4) the brain, urinary bladder, spinal cord, and lumbosacral (L6-S2) dorsal root ganglia were isolated from both control and CIE mice. tissues were fixed overnight (4\u00b0C) and afterward cryoprotected in sucrose (20%) for 3 days. immunofluorescent labeling was performed on spinal cord sections to evaluate spatial distribution of MBP and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) sections were washed in PBS for 5 min and blocked with blocking buffer containing 3% normal goat serum in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. ase inhibitor cocktail tablets (1 tablet/10 ml lysis buffer, catalog no. 11 836 170 001, Roche Applied Science), and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail tablets (1 tablet/10 ml lysis buffer, catalog no. 04 906 837 001, Roche Applied Science) samples were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min at 40\u00b0C, and supernatants with total protein were collected. plates were incubated for 2 h on an orbital shaker to keep beads suspended. plates were incubated for 2 h on an orbital shaker to keep beads suspended. samples were incubated for 30 min at room temperature and then washed three times. mice underwent a survival surgical procedure with the insertion of bladder catheters 4 days before the experimental endpoint (4 wk postinoculation) mice were given 4 days to recover from surgery before the initiation of cystometric evaluation of bladder function. each animal was observed for approximately six to eight voiding cycles. urodynamic values were continuously recorded using data-acquisition software. the frequency of withdrawal responses was tested using five individual fibers. each filament was applied for 1\u20132 s with an interstimulus interval of 5 s for a total of 10 times. the hairs were tested in ascending order of force. animals were weighed both before inoculation and every subsequent week until the experimental end point. all experiments were performed at 4 wk postinoculation, corresponding to the development of demyelination in the spinal cord as previously established for the MHV strain. slides were rinsed in distilled water for 15 s and then differentiated by cresyl violet (0.25%, catalog no. 62470, Sigma-Aldrich) slides were dehydrated quickly through three changes of absolute alcohol (200 proof) and cleared by fresh xylene (3 times) images were collected using a leica DM5000 microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) and stored using ImagePro software. levels of inflammation in the CNS and LUT assessed by multiplex ELISA. each sample and standards were run in duplicate. a 96-well microplate was loaded with 25 l diluted bead solution. wells designated for the standard curve received 100 l of the appropriate standard dilution. mice were placed in cages containing elevated (by 1 in.) mesh flooring for 3 h. each mouse had free access to sterile water gel (HydroGel) no food was available during testing. mice were given 4 days to recover from surgery before initiation of cystometric evaluation of bladder function. mice were allowed to recover from anaesthesia and subsequently transferred to individual cages to avoid catheter damage. max pressure at micturition, bladder capacity, micturition volume, number of nonmicturition contractions, intermicturition interval, and micturition rate indexes were calculated. results were statistically analyzed using one-way repeated-measures ANOVA between groups followed by Bonferroni's posttest as appropriate. all data are expressed as means SE. results were statistically analyzed using one-way repeated-measures ANOVA between groups followed by Bonferroni's posttest as appropriate (Systat Software) mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital (70 mg/kg) injected intraperitoneally. animals were transcardially perfused with physiological saline solution followed by 4% paraformaldehyde solution (pH 7.4) the brain, urinary bladder, spinal cord, and lumbosacral (L6-S2) were isolated from both control and CIE mice. bladder sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E Staining Kit, Richard-Allan Scientific, Kalamazoo, MI) and assessed for signs of edema and inflammation. immunofluorescent labeling was performed on spinal cord sections to evaluate spatial distribution of GFAP. extracts were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min at 40\u00b0C. the protein concentration in each sample was detected using the BCA protein assay kit. each sample and standards were run in duplicate. 50 l incubation buffer to each well; 50 l assay diluent and 50 l sample mixed in each of the assigned wells. plates were incubated for 2 h on an orbital shaker to keep beads suspended during the incubation. after incubation, plates were washed two times; 100 l of prepared 1 streptavidin-R-phycoerythrin was added to each occupied well. the cohort selected for urodynamic evaluation of urinary bladder function consisted of both infected (n = 4 mice/CIE group with a CSS of 2 or 3) and control mice (n = 6). these animals underwent a survival surgical procedure with the insertion of bladder catheters 4 days before the experimental endpoint (4 wk postinoculation). room temperature saline solution (0.9% NaCl) was infused into the bladder at a rate of 10 l/min. each animal was observed for approximately six to eight voiding cycles. urodynamic values were recorded using data-acquisition software. mice were placed in individual Plexiglas chambers containing a stainless steel wire grid floor. the frequency of withdrawal responses was tested using five individual fibers. each filament was applied for 1\u20132 s with an interstimulus interval of 5 s for a total of 10 times. the average CSS in the CIE group of mice was 2.3 0.5 at 1 wk postinoculation and 2.6 0.5 at 2 wk postinoculation (P 0.001 vs. the control group; Fig. 1A) the majority of infected mice reached their highest CSS within 1 wk after viral infection. weight changes in mice with a CSS from 1 to 3 after inoculation with MHV (n = 24) weight fluctuations in mice with coronavirus-induced encephalomyelitis (CIE) (n = 8 mice/group) distribution of demyelination and inflammation in CIE mice. additional immunohistochemical labeling with antibodies against GFAP showed a twofold upregulation in GFAP expression at demyelinated sites postinoculation. luxol fast blue-stained spinal cord section from a control mouse showing no signs of demyelination or inflammation. the site of demyelination showed a significant loss of GFAP labeling in the white matter. scale bar = 200 m. the right image is an enlarged area of the same demyelinated spot. in the spinal cord, only IFN- levels were upregulated at 1 wk postinoculation (P 0.05; Fig. 4C), suggesting a mild inflammatory reaction. however, this proved to be a transient response as normal levels were observed 4 wk postinfection. turition patterns from one of the infected mice (CSS of 3) are shown in Fig. 5. they reflect the development of neurogenic bladder overactivity. this relationship was observed from 2 wk postinoculation until 4 wk postinoculation in infected mice. the progression of demyelination in the CNS (mice with a CSS of 3) caused more severe changes in urodynamic parameters. shortened intermicturition intervals from 546 51 s (in control mice) to 236 14 s (P 0.05; Fig. 6B), decreased bladder capacity, and a reduced volume of voided urine. sensitivity was tested in a separate group of mice (n = 8) both pre- and postinoculation with MHV. mice with a CSS of 2 or 3 were used for this experiment. the response frequency correlated with the applied force. effects of inoculation with MHV-A59 on the sensitivity of the lower pelvic region as measured by the response to mechanical stimulation using von Frey filaments. behavioural phenotype and neurological deficit development in the CIE model. weight fluctuations directly correlated with severity of neurological impairment and CSS. mice with a CSS of 2 or 3 experienced significant weight loss after inoculation with MHV-A59 compared with animals with a CSS of 1. intensity of staining was significantly different between normal spinal cord sections and lesion sites in CIE mice. luxol blue staining in the dorsal root ganglia did not reveal any significant changes in neuronal morphology or nerve fibers between control and CEI animals. luxol fast blue-stained spinal cord sections revealed decreased intensity of staining in demyelinated areas after inoculation. the site of demyelination showed a significant loss of GFAP labeling in the white matter. a cytokine multiplex ELISA was used to evaluate the level of inflammation in the CNS and urinary bladder at 1 wk (acute stage) and 4 wk (recovery phase) postinoculation. in the spinal cord, only IFN- levels were upregulated at 1 wk postinoculation. ulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; IFN, interferon. effects of demyelination on micturition patters and urinary bladder function in vivo. 0.05 vs. baseline was performed in control mice (n = 6) and MHV-A59-infected mice (n = 4 mice with a CSS of 2 and 4 mice with a CSS of 3) at 4 wk postinoculation. demyelination of nerve fibers in the CNS after inoculation led to long-lasting changes in micturition patterns. traces of cystometrograms recorded in a freely moving control mouse and inoculated mice with a CSS of 2 (middle) or 3 (bottom) Arrows indicate nonmicturition contractions. a: comparison of the duration of intermicturition intervals between control and CIE mice. responses to higher force filaments did not differ from baseline levels. by 4 wk postinoculation, the significant neurological deficit was paralleled by a substantial diminution of abdominal sensitivity to mechanical stimulation of the lower pelvis. sensitivity of the pelvic region to mechanical stimulation undergoes phasic changes. k postinoculation and 2.6 0.5 at 2 wk postinoculation among infected animals. 28% reached a CSS of 4 and 5 associated with the acute phase of encephalitis. none of these animals survived the acute phase of infection. luxol blue staining in the dorsal root ganglia did not reveal any significant changes in neuronal morphology or nerve fibers between control and CEI mice. luxol blue staining in the dorsal root ganglia did not reveal any significant changes in neuronal morphology or nerve fibers between control and CEI animals. luxol fast blue-stained spinal cord section from a control (Ctrl) mouse showed no signs of demyelination or inflammation. the sites of demyelination are indicated by arrows. the site of demyelination showed a significant loss of GFAP labeling in the white matter. Scale bar = 200 m. the right image is an enlarged area of the same demyelinated spot. no changes in cytokine levels were observed in the urinary bladder during the entire course of investigation. GM-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; IFN, interferon revealed no changes in the cytokine profile in the urinary bladder. small and large urine spots correlated with clinical deficit. this relationship was observed from 2 wk postinoculation until 4 wk postinoculation in infected mice. representative images of voiding spots in a mouse with CIE (CSS of 3) taken every week for 4 wk. the progression of demyelination in the CNS caused more severe changes in urodynamic parameters, including shortened intermicturition intervals from 546 51 s (in control mice) to 236 14 s (P 0.05; Fig. 6B), decreased bladder capacity, and a reduced volume of voided urine. these results confirm the development of neurogenic bladder dysfunction in CIE mice. sensitivity was tested in a separate group of mice (n = 8) both pre- and postinoculation with MHV. the response frequency correlated with the applied force, reaching a plateau of 27.2 4.2% with the maximum tested force of 4 g. coronavirus-induced mouse model of encephalomyelitis. titers reach maximum values in the CNS at 5 days postinfection. viral RNA persist in the CNS. a key event in the formation of characteristic MS lesions in CIE mice is the infiltration into the CNS of myelin-specific CD4+ T helper (Th)1 cells capable of secreting proinflammatory Th1-type cytokines. the process of transmigration of circulating immune cells to the urinary bladder is complex, involving their activation by cytokines. GFAP expression is widely used as a marker for astrogliosis. but the precise functional role of GFAP in astrocytes is not known. reactivation of astrocytes may have detrimental effects by increasing neurotoxic substances, exacerbating cell loss and minimizing CNS repair by scar formation. bladder stones begin to develop 7\u201310 days after catheterization due to narrow diameter of the catheters and the small size of mouse bladders. previous studies have determined that mice with MBP-induced EAE develop both detrusor areflexia and detrusor hyperactivity in 52% of female rats compared with 12% that developed detrusor overactivity. ter dyssynergia after the onset of EAE has also been reported in EAE rats (4, 5). the viral etiology of the LUT dysfunction in CIE mice and earlier experimental time point postinoculation (28 days compared with 70 days in EAE models) likely underlie differences between cystometric findings in our study and the aforementioned EAE models.
