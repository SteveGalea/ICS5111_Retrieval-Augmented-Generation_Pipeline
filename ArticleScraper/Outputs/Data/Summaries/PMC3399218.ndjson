{"summary": "both PE and DVT are named venous thromboembolism (VTE) because of the high incidence of misdiagnosis, morbidity and mortality, VTE has become one of the essential medical problems around world 1. after 1990's, clinical reports of PE are sharply increased yearly in China. in other Asia regions, such as Japan, Thailand, Singapore, Taiwan, the number of reported PE cases is also increasing 4-8. the annual number of VTE cases is increasing over year actually. the traditional concept can be verified merely in few patients with VTE. the pathogenesis of majority of other patients is still to be elucidated. ml of peripheral blood samples anti-coagulated with EDTA were drawn from patients suspected with PE immediately after admitting to the hospital. total mononuclear cell RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) and purified with Qiagen RNeasy column. statistical analysis Significant differential gene expression analysis Random variance model (RVM) corrected t-test was used for the differential gene expression screening due to the small number of patients (20 cases each group) was far less than the amount of genes and low freedom degree of gene expression signal. the exact test was applied for over representation of selected genes in GO biological categories. all patients were diagnosed as PE in accordance with at least 2 of following criteria. 11 males, 9 females, 44-91 years old, averaged 70(14) years of age. 750 ng of Cy3 labeled sample cDNA was subjected to fragmentation (30 min at 60\u00b0C) and then hybridization on 44K human oligo-chips (G4112F, Agilent Technologies) in a rotary oven. slides were disassembled and washed in solutions I and II according to the manufacturer's instructions. false discovery rate (FDR) was estimated for all of categories. after 5,000 re-samplings, FDR was defined as FDR=1-Nk/T. Nk refers to subtracted number which was from Fisher's test p-values. nf is the number of significant genes within the particular category, n is the total number of significant genes within the same category, n is the number of significant genes in the entire microarray, n is the number of all genes tested. expressions of 3 in 7 genes of platelet adhesion function were significantly increased in patients with PE. mRNA expression of 2 (FIBCD1) and F7 among 15 genes are significantly elevated in patients with PE. mRNA expression of fibrolysis factors is significantly different in PE group. gene ontology analysis exhibited compromised T cell mediated immune function. t test indicated associated genes were significantly down-regulated in patients with PE compared with patients without PE. ICAM-1 is the ligand of ITGAL which is member of integrin family. significantly elevated mRNA expression of these adhesion molecules in PE group indicate activated adhesion function of white blood cells. however, mRNA expression of P-selectin and E-selection are not elevated in PE group. compared to patients without PE, significantly elevated mRNA expression were found only in 2 (GP6, PAFAH1B2) of 11 genes of aggregation, 3 (GP1BA, GP9 and ITGA2B) of 7 genes of adhesion and 1(THBS3) of 15 genes of releasing. mRNA expressions of 3/7 adhesion molecules were markedly up-regulated in PE patients. this suggests the adhesion of platelets plays an important role in the pathogenesis of PE. the occurrence of PE is related to the deficient or compromised T cell mediated immunity. comparisons between PE patients and controls revealed the mRNA expressions of only a few proteins in the coagulation system, anti-coagulation system and fibrinolysis system were markedly up-regulated. only 3 factors or receptors in the shared coagulation cascade were activated, which was inconsistent with traditional theory that coagulation factors are comprehensively activated."}
