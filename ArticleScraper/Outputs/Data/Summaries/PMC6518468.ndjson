{"summary": "the betacoronavirus genus includes multiple bat-associated viruses and several human pathogens, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2013 a novel clade C Betacoronavirus was discovered in the western European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus) in Germany [3] the virus was subsequently detected in the same species in the same species in the same species in france [4]. dromedaries infected with MERS-CoV develop pyrexia with mild upper respiratory signs, consisting of serous to purulent nasal discharge. dromedaries infected with MERS-CoV develop pyrexia with mild upper respiratory signs, consisting of serous to purulent nasal discharge. 225 were voided faecal samples collected from live hedgehogs. faecal samples were stored at 4 or 20 \u00b0C for a maximum of 1 week. a subsample of each sample collected by Sangster et al. [23] was used in the current study. 121 of 122 hedgehogs from which samples of distal large intestinal contents were tested. data included sex, live body weight, faecal characteristics and reason for admittance. each sample was homogenised and pooled. a 102 dilution of extracted RNA from a positive EriCoV sample (R618/14, previously confirmed through sequencing) was used as the positive control. a 110 bp EriCoV ultramer oligonucleotide was used to quantify the limits of detection. real-time RT-PCR assays using the EriCoV primers were carried out for all pooled samples. single samples from positive pools were then extracted and tested individually. amplicons from individual samples (n = 10) were also assessed by gel electrophoresis. paired end reads were compared with the sequence derived by Illumina sequencing. total reads (12 908 682) were mapped to a reference EriCoV sequence from germany. the total reads were 1 217 783 (9.43% of total reads) Statistical analysis Associations between EriCoV-positive status, case history signalment and pathological findings were explored. cross-tabulation and Pearson's 2 tests were undertaken for the binary dependent variable (EriCoV presence or absence) against all other categorical independent variables. an additional four voided faecal samples were collected from the wild. the remaining 122 samples were of distal large intestinal tract contents collected from dead hedgehogs during post-mortem examination (PME) the remaining 122 samples were of distal large intestinal tract contents collected from dead hedgehogs during post-mortem examination. RNA stabilising agent RNAlater (Ambion, Life Technologies Europe, NL) was added to a pea-sized amount of each sample (faeces or distal large intestinal tract contents) each sample was then stored at either 20 or 80 \u00b0C. each 140 l of total pooled sample was added to 560 l buffer AVL-carrier RNA solution. a 110 bp EriCoV ultramer oligonucleotide was used to quantify the limits of detection and assess the sensitivity of the designed assay. this was a sequence within the EriCoV primer RdRp target region, but with the removal of 10 nucleotides at the centre to differentiate it from wild-type EriCoV. a 14-fold dilution series was performed and a standard curve was generated using GraphPad Prism 6 ( cDNA was synthesised from 50 ng RNA using a random cDNA synthesis system (cDNA Synthesis Kit, Merck, De) cDNA was purified using ampure XP magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter, High Wycombe, UK), 1 ng of which was processed for sequencing using the Nextera XT DNA sample preparation kit (Illumina) despite the low proportion of viral sequence detected within the total data set, coverage of the entire genome was obtained (average coverage depth of 4546 reads) post-mortem analysis and histopathological investigation Gross PME findings were available for both organ systems from 94 of the 121 hedgehog examined post mortem. binary logistic regression was performed to include consideration of continuous independent variables, such as age, and to quantify the strength of association for multiple variables simultaneously. results Detection of EriCoV Of 351 samples examined, 38 were positive for EriCoV, giving a positive percentage of 10.8%. reading frame (ORF) lengths of Erinaceus coronavirus from Great Britain (GB) and german hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus) GB EriCov protein length (AA) % AA identity with EriCoV/2012-174/Ger/2012. the proportion positive in 2015 was higher (28/144, 19%) than in 2014 (10/182, 5%) but there were too few submissions from other years to determine if there was an association with year of sampling. we tested for the possibility of an association between EriCoV status and abnormal faeces.
