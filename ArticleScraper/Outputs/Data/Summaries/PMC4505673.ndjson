{"summary": "TEXT Entry of the enveloped coronaviruses (CoVs) is mediated by the spike (S) glycoprotein. the coV S proteins rely on proteolytic cleavage by host proteases for fusion priming/activation. cleavage enables the release of the fusion peptide and its insertion into the target cell membrane in a controlled manner. gene and mutational analyses have pointed to a conserved arginine just upstream of the fusion peptide (S2\u2032 site) in membrane fusion domain S2 as the trypsin cleavage site for fusion activation. however, direct evidence of functional cleavage at this position is lacking. we introduced an artificial cleavage recognition site for the furin protease into the PEDV spike protein. in cleavage site at the S2\u2032 position (SFCS) mediates trypsin-independent cell-cell fusion. indicated are the positions of receptor binding domain S1 and membrane fusion domain S2, predicted N-glycosylation sites. the transfection experiments were repeated two times. first, we assessed whether the introduction of the furin cleavage site in S enables trypsin-independent cell-cell fusion. we transiently expressed the SFCS protein and the SWT protein, each provided with a C-terminally appended Flag tag, in vero cells. the nonessential ORF3 gene in the genomes of both recombinant viruses was replaced by the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene. recombinant PEDV-SWT and PEDV-SFCS were successfully rescued in the presence of trypsin. the relevant S gene region of their genomes was confirmed by sequencing. 777 S (PEDV-SWT) or mutated CV777 S (PEDV-SFCS) in the presence of trypsin (15 g/ml) or trypsin (15 g/ml) at 2 h postinfection, cells were washed and further cultured in the presence of trypsin inhibitor (SBTI; 40 g/ml) the growth kinetics of PEDV-SWT and PEDV-SFCS on vero cells were compared in the absence and presence of trypsin. both viruses showed similar growth kinetics and reached similar titers in the presence of trypsin. the results indicate that the introduction of the furin cleavage site did not result in detectable cleavage. inoculation of Huh-7 cells with PEDV-SFCS resulted in trypsin-independent infection and the development of syncytia. some cells could be inhibited by furin inhibitor, yet no syncytia were seen. cleavage occurs only in subset of coronaviruses and does not liberate the putative fusion peptide at the N terminus of the membrane-anchored subunit. the second, more appropriately located, S2\u2032 cleavage site was identified only recently, and evidence for its general importance in CoV infection has since been accumulating. furin cleavage motif N terminal of the spike fusion peptide confers cell-cell fusion and PEDV entry in a trypsin-independent manner. both processes were blocked by a furin-specific inhibitor, confirming the functionality of furin cleavage at the S2\u2032 position. field strains of PEDV strictly require exogenous trypsin for propagation in vitro. serial passaging of the virus on cultured cells can lead to trypsin independency."}
