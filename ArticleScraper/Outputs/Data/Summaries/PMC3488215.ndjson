{"summary": "large rRNAs in all species carry post-transcriptional modifications. rRNAs range from 14 in mycoplasma to more than a hundred in humans. functional 30S subunits can be assembled using unmodified 16S rRNA. eukaryotes and archaea use ribonucleoprotein complexes to carry out guide RNA-mediated rRNA recognition and modification. ribosomal PTC is the target for numerous antibiotics (10,11) resistance to these antibiotics often comes through post-transcriptional modifications, for example, methylation of A2503 by the Cfr enzyme (12) leading to higher sensitivity to antibiotics. sequence CXUCGAU is conserved in the central loop of domain V of 23S rRNA that has four modification sites. in high-resolution crystal structures of ribosomes from different bacteria (14\u201316), C2498 and U2500 are base paired to G2454 and A2453 respectively. the 2\u2032O methylation adds hydrophobicity and has been suggested to stabilize the structure by filling a void in the packing between these regions. the knockout of RlmM is viable but leads to lower fitness compared with wild type in competition assays (9). in this work, we have solved the crystal structure of E. coli RlmM and its complex with AdoMet and demonstrated RlmM activity on in vitro-transcribed rRNA. RNA was quantified by agarose gel electrophoresis. rRNA from the wild-type BW25113 strain (20) was extracted using sodium dodecyl sulfate/phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation after cells were grown in Luria Broth (LB) at 37\u00b0C overnight. the lysate was cleared by centrifugation and loaded into a bio-Rad Econo-Pac gravity flow column containing Ni-SepharoseTM. after incubation for 1 h, the column was washed with 40 mM imidazole in buffer A. the protein was eluted with 250 mM imidazole in buffer A. aliquots were quenched in 50:50 phenol:chloroform at 0 s (before enzyme addition), 30 s, 1, 2, 4, 8, 20, 45 and 90 min. primer extension analysis was used to detect the modification. the reaction mixture was then ethanol precipitated with 30 l 300 mM NaOAc, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and 90 l 100% ethanol (24) the gel was dried at 80\u00b0C under vacuum and analyzed by phosphoimaging (Bio-Rad FX) at 20\u00b0C in sitting drop vapor diffusion experiments containing 1.5 l RlmM (10 mg/ml) and 1.5 l reservoir solution (0.3 M ammonium tartrate, pH 7.0 and 20% PEG 3350) diffraction data were collected at 100 K at MAX-Lab, Lund, Sweden on MarCCD detectors. attempts to solve the structure by molecular replacement failed. 90, 120 90, 90, 120 90, 90, 120 90, 90, 120 90, 90, 120, 90, 120 Resolution range (a 20.1\u20131.9 (2.0\u20131.9) 30.0\u20131.95 (2.05\u20131.95) 30.0\u20132.6 (2.7\u20132.6) 30.0\u20132.2 (2.3\u20132.2) Wavelength () 1.041 1.041 1.041 1.072 Unique reflections 64 294 30 029 12 983 42 258 Completeness (%) 99.8 (98.2) 99. eight platinum sites were located using PHENIX (26) heavy atom refinement, phasing and density modification were performed in PHENIX. the initial model was built using PHENIX AutoBuild (26) and improved by cycles of manual building in Coot (27) and refinement against the native RlmM data in PHENIX. rRNA from the wild-type BW25113 strain (20) was extracted using sodium dodecyl sulfate/phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. the resulting DNA was digested with AflII and gel purified (Qiagen) the resulting DNA was digested with AflII and digested with pEXP. the cells were cultured in LB with 100 g/ml ampicillin at 37\u00b0C to A600 of 0.5. the cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed in 20 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl and stored at 20\u00b0C. fractions eluting at monomer size were pooled and concentrated to 10 mg/ml using a Vivaspin 30 kDa cut-off concentrator. Optimal buffer composition was identified by differential scanning fluorimetry (22), where Na2SO4 was identified as the salt that gave the highest thermal stability to RlmM. five nanograms of labeled primers were annealed to the rRNA in hybridization buffer (56 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7 and 111 mM KCl) the hybridization mix was combined with 1U Avian Myeloblastosis Virus reverse transcriptase (NEB; 10-fold diluted in 50 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 8.4; 2 mM DTE and 50% (v/v) glyce s were separated on a 20 40 cm 0.75 mm 6% polyacrylamide/7 M urea gel run at 30 W until the bromophenol blue dye reached the bottom. Quantity One software was used to quantitate the band intensities corresponding to stops at nucleotides C2499, G2502, G2508 and U2511 of the same lane. RlmM was co-crystallized with 5 mM K2PtCl4 in the P3121 condition. a 2.6 dataset was collected at beamline I911-2. all diffraction data were processed and scaled using XDS (25) 8\u20131.95 28.9\u20132.6 Reflections (test set) 61 052 (3212) 28 520 (1502) 12 333 (650) Number of atoms Protein 5808 2916 2888 Water 552 195 87 Other 157 134 103 Rwork/Rfree (%) 16.4/20.6 16.9/20.6 16.3/19.6 Average B-factor (2) Protein 21.4 33.0 28.6 Water 28.0 39.1 26.8 Other 30.7 52.1 49.7 structure factors have been deposited in the protein data bank (PDB) with accession numbers 4ATN (P3121), 4AUK (P31) and 4B17 (P3121 AdoMet complex) BLAST was used to identify full-length homologues of E. coli RlmM. the extent of modification in the in vitro reaction is nearly the same as found in the wild-type 23S rRNA. RlmM is capable of modifying unmodified 23S rRNA domain V alone to the same extent as full length IVT. structure determination of RlmM E. coli RlmM with a C-terminal His-tag was crystallized with polyethylene glycol and ammonium tartrate in two crystal forms belonging to space group P31. molecular replacement trials with other fold MTase domains failed to provide sufficient phase information to build the structure. final refined structures of RlmM contain residues 1\u2013357. the structures of RlmM in the two crystal forms are close to identical. in the P31 structure, molecules A and B superpose with a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.55 for 355 C atoms. however, when the P31 structures are superposed on the N-terminal domain of the P3121 structure, there is a minor rotational movement of the C-terminal domain. bacterial sequence alignment was used to identify conserved residues. the sequence identity to E. coli RlmM ranges from 44% for the Xanthomonas oryzae protein to 94% for the Salmonella enterica protein. the THUMP domain contains a seven-stranded mostly anti-parallel -sheet. it contains a seven-stranded mostly anti-parallel -sheet (5 and 6 are parallel) it can be further divided into a ferredoxin-like domain (FLD, amino acid 1\u201373) and a C-terminal \u2018minimal THUMP\u2019 (amino acid 74\u2013164) corresponding to the two sides of the half-barrel. Pyrococcus furiosus (pdb 3tm5, RMSD 2.7 for 145 C atoms) and TrmN from Thermus thermophilus (pdb 3tma, RMSD 3.3 for 141 C atoms) (40) and the N-terminal part of the rRNA m2G2445 MTase RlmKL (pdb 3v8v, RMSD 2.8 for 135 C atoms the lengths of 4 and 7 at the center of the sheet affect the shape of the half-barrel, so that RlmM has more of a V-shape. ThiI where both strands participate in the two sheets forms a shallow U and Trm14, TrmN and RlmKL, which have only 4 bridging the two sheets are intermediate. conserved residues in RlmM cluster in and around the functional motifs I\u2013VIII and X in AdoMet-dependent MTases. motifs IV, VI, VIII and X form the 2\u2032O-ribose MTase-specific K-D-K-E/H catalytic tetrad (46). the second Lys is thought to act as a general base by deprotonating the ribose 2\u2032OH nucle structure of the 2\u2032O-ribose MTases YiiB (pdb 3opn), FlpA (pdb 1nt2 (47), RrmJ (pdb 1eiz) and Nsp5 (pdb 2wa2 (51)) were superposed onto the RlmM MTase domain. the catalytic tetrad K191-D277-K306-E347 is present structure-based sequence alignment of the RlmM MTase domain with homologues identified by the DALI search. -helices (red background) and -strands (yellow background) labeled according to the RlmM MTase domain (numbers) and the consensus AdoMet-dependent MTases (letters) the side chain of K162 (green) moves to the orientation of K182 (yellow) when bound to substrate RNA. the simulated annealing Fo\u2013Fc omit map of AdoMet is contoured at 2.0. waters are shown as red spheres and hydrogen bonds as dotted lines. soak AdoMet into pre-formed RlmM crystals gave only partial density for the ligand, indicating low occupancy and/or multiple conformations of the ligand. the apo structure superposed on the apo structure with an RMSD of 0.19 for the entire protein (357 C atoms) motif II loop binds to a hydrophobic surface formed by M278 in motif IV interacting with G261 in motif III. the base is normally partially or completely covered by a \u2018lid\u2019 residue from the motif II loop that narrows the opening of the AdoMet-binding pocket. the amino group of the methionine moiety forms a hydrogen bond with the catalytic D277 in motif IV. at the C-terminal end of 8, D217 extends to make water-mediated hydrogen bond to the carboxylate and amino groups of the methionine moiety. RlmM (A) and Trm14 (pdb 3tm5 (40), B) were superposed based on the N-terminal THUMP domain. the conserved, putative RNA-binding surface of RlmM is visible in the bottom view, while the putative RNA-binding surface of Trm14 is visible in the top view. RlmM modifies in vitro transcribed 23S rRNA at C2498. dNTP concentrations cause reverse transcriptase to pause one nucleotide before a 2\u2032O methylation site. dGTP concentration for Cm2498 detection reported by Purta et al. the extent of modification in the in vitro reaction is nearly the same as found in the wild-type 23S rRNA. RlmM is capable of modifying unmodified 23S rRNA domain V alone to the same extent as full length IVT. molecular replacement trials with other Rossmann-like fold MTase domains failed to provide sufficient phase information to build the structure. the final refined structures of RlmM contain residues 1\u2013357. the C-terminal residues 358\u2013366 and the His-tag were disordered in all structures. the structures of RlmM in the two crystal forms are close to identical. in the P31 structure, molecules A and B superpose with a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.55 for 355 C atoms. the P3121 structure superposes onto molecules A and B of the P31 structure with RMSDs of 0.72 and 0.77, respectively, for 355 C atoms. lmM ranges from 44% for the Xanthomonas oryzae protein to 94% for the Salmonella enterica protein. conserved residues are shown in white on red background and conservative substitutions are shown in red on white background. conserved residues are arginines and lysines, resulting in a strong patch of positive charge that overlaps with the conserved surface. the THUMP domain (amino acids 1\u2013176) is a THUMP domain according to the classification in the SCOP database. it contains a seven-stranded mostly anti-parallel -sheet forming a half-barrel with one short and one longer helix on each side. THUMP domains are followed by catalytic Rossmann-like fold MTase domains. the same is true for a putative methylase from Clostridium difficile. THUMP domains only share 10\u201315% sequence identity. RlmM contains extra 310 helix that forms hydrophobic interactions with the center of the barrel. each of the compared THUMP domains have unique structural features, such as an extra -hairpin in Trm14 and a longer 1 in ThiI. conserved residues in RlmM cluster in and around the functional motifs I\u2013VIII and X in AdoMet-dependent MTases. motifs IV, VI, VIII and X form the 2\u2032O-ribose MTase-specific K-D-K-E/H catalytic tetrad (46). structure of the 2\u2032O-ribose MTases YiiB (pdb 3opn), FlpA (pdb 1nt2 (47), RrmJ (pdb 1eiz) and Nsp5 (pdb 2wa2 (51)) were superposed onto the RlmM MTase domain. the catalytic tetrad K191-D277-K306-E347 is present structure-based sequence alignment of the RlmM MTase domain with YiiB from Lactococcus lactis (pdb 3opn), FlpA from Archaeoglobus fulgidus (pdb 1nt2 (47) and Nsp5 from Modoc virus. -helices (red background) and -strands (yellow background) are labeled according to the RlmM MTase domain (num the side chain of K162 (green) moves to the orientation of K182 (yellow) when bound to substrate RNA. the simulated annealing Fo\u2013Fc omit map of AdoMet is contoured at 2.0. the interacting residues are shown in grey and colored by atom type. the RlmM AdoMet complex structure superposed on the apo structure with an RMSD of 0.19 for the entire protein (357 C atoms) no global conformational change takes place upon AdoMet binding. the shape of the pocket depends on the presence and length of helices B, C and D that position the motif II and III loops. motif II loop (D240\u2013G242) has an open conformation in all our structures. there is no evidence for conformational changes in this loop upon AdoMet binding to other 2\u2032O-ribose MTases. the ribose of AdoMet is stabilized by hydrogen bonds of the 2\u2032OH and 3\u2032OH. the amino group of the methionine moiety forms a hydrogen bond with the catalytic D277 in motif IV. at the C-terminal end of 8, D217 extends to make water-mediated hydrogen bond to the carboxylate and amino groups of the methionine moiety. the positively charged residues overlap with the conserved region. RlmM (A) and Trm14 (pdb 3tm5 (40), B) were superposed based on the N-terminal THUMP domain. the conserved, putative RNA-binding surface of RlmM is visible in the bottom view. the comparison does not provide any clues about how the RNA potentially could influence the AdoMet-binding site. the catalytic domain of RlmM was more similar to YiiB and TlyA, annotated as putative hemolysins. in 2\u2032O-ribose MTases, the position of the -amino group of the second catalytic lysine is thought to be crucial for deprotonation of the ribose 2\u2032OH. in FlpA, binding of the substrate RNA re-orients the Lys so that its -amino group can make the proper interaction with the 2\u2032OH of the ribose. protein-mediated stabilization occurs in the archaebacterial fibrillarin-Nop5p complex. nop5p stabilizes the motif II and III regions through interactions with B and 3. the stimulatory subunit Nsp10 is essential for AdoMet binding and MTase activity of the SARS coronavirus-encoded Nsp16. the THUMP domains seem to have evolved different shapes from a common structural scaffold. a \u2018channel\u2019 formed by the THUMP beta half-barrel has been suggested to be used for RNA binding. in RlmM, the likely RNA-binding surface of RlmM involves both domains and a positively charged inter-domain linker. our assays show that RlmM is active on in vitro transcribed 23S rRNA substrate as well as on the in vitro transcribed 604 nt domain V construct. the interaction between domain V and domain II right at the modification site is not needed for substrate recognition. the interaction between domain V and domain II right at the modification site is not needed for substrate recognition. the local RNA structure may change upon binding to the enzyme. it would also be possible that RlmM acts on an available 50S assembly intermediate where the 2\u2032-oxygen of C2498 is accessible. in 2\u2032O-ribose MTases, the position of the -amino group of the second catalytic lysine is thought to be crucial for deprotonation of the ribose 2\u2032OH. in FlpA, binding of the substrate RNA re-orients the Lys so that its -amino group can make the proper interaction with the 2\u2032OH of the ribose. protein-mediated stabilization occurs in the archaebacterial fibrillarin-Nop5p complex. the stimulatory subunit Nsp10 is essential for AdoMet binding and MTase activity of the SARS coronavirus-encoded Nsp16. the THUMP domains seem to have evolved different shapes from a common structural scaffold and distinct surfaces for RNA recognition in the different enzymes. a \u2018channel\u2019 formed by the THUMP beta half-barrel has been suggested to be used for RNA binding (38,41), but in RlmM, the corresponding groove is filled. our assays show that RlmM is active on in vitro transcribed 23S rRNA substrate as well as on the in vitro transcribed 604 nt domain V construct. therefore, the interaction between domain V and domain II right at the modification site is not needed for substrate recognition. the interaction between domain V and domain II right at the modification site is not needed for substrate recognition. the local RNA structure may change upon binding to the enzyme. it would also be possible that RlmM acts on an available 50S assembly intermediate where the 2\u2032-oxygen of C2498 is accessible."}
