{"summary": "1 influenza A virus is divided into different subtypes based on antigenic reactivity of their two surface glycoproteins, the haemagglutinin and the neuraminidase. so far, 16 different haemagglutinin (H1\u2013H16) and nine neuraminidase (N1\u2013N9) subtypes have been identified among all influenza A viruses. 9, 10 In addition to being important natural hosts, pigs constitute a valuable animal model for the study of influenza infection. 5, 11 as virus may be transmitted experimentally to incontact animals. 4, 5, 13, 14, 15 However, such studies are greatly affected by animal welfare considerations and logistical constraints. swine tracheal EVOC system for the study of influenza virus infection. tissue collected from a single animal can be used in numerous replicas. tracheas were kept at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2\u201395% air mixture. the presence of bacterial flora was evaluated by inoculation of the final washing medium in brain heart infusion broth (Oxoid, Hampshire, UK) the surrounding connective tissue present exterior to the tracheal cartilage was removed and tracheas were cut lengthways into four strips. each segment, incorporating the respiratory mucosa and underlying cartilage, was then cut into approximately 10 05 cm explants. the assay was considered positive if the microbeads had been completely cleared to one edge of the tissue. the assay was considered positive if the microbeads had been completely cleared to one edge of the tissue. sections were washed twice for 5 minutes with 005% Tween 20 in TBS (TBS/T) and incubated for 1 hour at 22 3\u00b0C with a donkey antichicken IgY biotinlabelled antiserum (1:200 in blocking buffer; Jackson Immunoresearch Europe Ltd, Newmarket, UK) cDNA synthesis from 50 ng of total RNA was performed with superScriptTM III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) cDNA synthesis from 50 ng of total RNA was performed with the specific primer for the influenza matrix segment described in Hoffmann et al. 34 Realtime RTPCR. tracheas were kept at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2\u201395% air mixture in a humidified incubator. four to six washes were performed, over a period of 3 hours, by immersing the tissue in fresh, warm DMEM/RPMI medium. tracheas were kept at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2\u201395% air mixture in a humidified incubator for up to 7 days. the presence of bacterial flora was evaluated by inoculation of the final washing medium in brain heart infusion broth. explant were subject to haematoxylin\u2013eosin, periodic acidSchiff and Van Gieson staining. epithelial layer thickness Haematoxylin\u2013eosin stained slides were used to measure thickness of epithelial layer using ImageJ software. five randomly selected fields across each section were measured and statistical significance was assessed by analysis of variance using Prism 5. avianlike swine H1N1 influenza virus was grown in embryonated chicken eggs. aliquoted and stored at 80\u00b0C. virus isolated from pigs suffering a respiratory disease outbreak in 2006. inoculated explants were immersed in 15 ml of sterile phosphatebuffered saline (pH 74) and shaken in a Mixer Mill MM300 (Retsch, Leeds, UK) at 20 Hz for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C. RNA extractions were performed according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. RNA was performed using a realtime quantitative RTPCR (qPCR) assay 35 run in a Corbett Rotor Gene 3000 (Corbett Research, Mortlake, Australia) cycle parameters were: 15 minutes at 95\u00b0C followed by 45 cycles of 15 seconds at 94\u00b0C and 60 seconds at 60\u00b0C. inoculated explants were sampled every 24 hours for histology, bead clearance assays and viral quantification. sections were washed twice for 5 minutes with 005% Tween 20 in TBS (TBS/T) and incubated for 1 hour at 22 3\u00b0C with a donkey antiswine influenza polyclonal antibody (1:4000) sed in 15 ml of sterile phosphatebuffered saline (pH 74) and shaken in a mixer mill MM300. the supernatant was used in plaque assays (performed in triplicate) in MDCK cells. results were expressed as arithmetic mean pfu/ml. 102 to 1 108 copies per microlitre of cDNA were run in triplicate. for each run, all samples, as well as the notemplate controls, plasmid standards, and positive and negative controls were run in triplicate. results Tracheal explants maintain normal histology for up to 7 days. sections of explants maintained in ex vivo organ culture system for 0 (A, E), 1 (B), 3 (C), 5 (D) and 7 days (E) sections stained with haematoxylin and eosin (200 magnification) vivo influenza infection, 4, 36 including loss of cilia at the apical surface, shrinking and vacuolization of epithelial cells with signs of destruction and desquamation. significant difference in thickness of epithelial layer between mock and virusinfected was observed. fected and infected explants (E) and percentage of infected tracheal explants clearing microbeads within specified times (F) over the course of 7 days. data are represented as mean + SD (error bars) of three independent experiments. tracheal explants were inoculated with 25 101, 25 102 or 25 104 pfu. the peak viral load was observed at day 1 pi. the peak viral load was reduced at day 3 pi but then there followed a resurgence in copy number. a progressive increase in the amount of mucus on the epithelial apical surface was observed from day 3 onwards. periodic acidSchiff staining showed that explants maintained overall carbohydrate levels. the average thickness of the epithelium did not change significantly (P = 04) for the duration of the organ culture. sections stained with periodic acidSchiff (A\u2013D), black arrows indicating goblet cells, or Van Gieson (E\u2013H) showing elastic fibres stained black in the submucosa (200 magnification) data are represented as means + SD (error bars) of three independent experiments. infected swine tracheal explants display similar histopathology to that observed in in vivo influenza infection. negative staining was predominantly seen in the nucleus, but with some also in the cytoplasm. in subsequent infections with a lower dose of virus (25 102 pfu) the pattern of cells with positive staining remained evenly distributed across the tissue section. swine tracheal explants were infected with 25 102 pfu of swine influenza virus. explants were inoculated with 25 101, 25 102 or 25 104 pfu. qPCR assay to measure intracellular and extracellular virus was used. explants inoculated with 25 104 pfu showed a different pattern of infection. peak viral load was reduced at day 3 pi but then there followed a resurgence in copy number by day 5 pi. a marked increase in viral copy number was observed at days 4 and 5 pi. tracheal explants 39 immersed in cell culture medium have been used previously for the study of influenza infection. cells of the epithelial lining of the trachea maintain the same morphological appearance and differentiation as described in the living host. the overall histology of the explants was preserved for 7 days with no significant differences in the thickness of the uninfected epithelium. this is consistent with previous reports of similar systems in which explants of different species have been maintained for variable periods of time. infection kinetics was dose dependent: a single peak occurred at day 3 pi. lowest infection dose resulted in detectable virus at day 2 pi. a large inoculum would be expected to infect most of the susceptible cells. EVOC systems should be considered as an alternative to in vivo experiments. the swine influenza virus was obtained through a programme of influenza surveillance in GB pigs funded by Defra. brown IH.
