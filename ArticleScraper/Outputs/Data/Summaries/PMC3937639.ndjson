{"summary": "the positive-strand RNA genome of CHIKV is 11.8 kb in length and exhibits a 5\u2032-terminal methylguanylate cap-0 structure and a 3\u2032 poly(A) sequence (3). the ns polyproteins, their cleavage intermediates, and mature nsPs are multifunctional, representing indispensable virus-encoded components of replication complexes. nsP4 is a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (18) in infected cells, nsP2 localizes to both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. it displays multiple activities including inducing the cessation of cellular transcription and inhibiting antiviral responses (20, 21) bioinformatics analysis suggests that alphaviral nsP2 comprises five domains. the outline of the constructs used in this study is presented below showing modifications introduced into the nsP2 with the emphasis on the alterations in the N-terminal region. the left panel represents the three-dimensional model of the region encompassing aa 1\u2013470 of CHIKV nsP2 built by the I-TASSER server (33). alphaviral nsP2 helicase belongs to SF1 (24), whereas enzymes from other SFs act as oligomeric proteins (23). helicases from SF1 and SF2 usually contain two RecA-like domains that participate in the binding and hydrolysis of NTP or dNTP molecules (25) CHIKV nsP2 lacking 166 aa residues at its N terminus and 168 aa residues at its C terminus exhibits NTPase and RNA triphosphatase activities. a bioinformatics approach was applied in an attempt to understand the possible folding pattern of the N-terminal region of nsP2. ructural Modeling of CHIKV N470 The sequence of the N-terminal region encompassing aa 1\u2013470 of CHIKV (LR2006-OPY1 strain) nsP2 was processed using the Protein Homology/Analogy Recognition Engine (PHYRE) and PHYRE 2 (32), I-TASSER (33), and MODELLER (34) the obtained structural model was manually compared with the published three-dimensional structures of SF1 heli pET-N470 encoded N470, the N-terminal fragment of nsP2 encompassing aa 1\u2013470. pET-N470-K192A, pET-N470-D252A, and pET-N470-E253A were generated via PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis. nsP2-delNTD (deletion of aa 1\u2013167) and nsP2-del cells were harvested via centrifugation and resuspended in 40 ml of lysis buffer A (50 mm Na2HPO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol, and 0.5 mm Pefabloc SC) the cells were lysed using an EmulsiFlex-C3 high pressure homogenizer (Avestin, Germany) the fraction containing N470 without the affinity tag was dialyzed against buffer C (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 50 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol) the protein solution was loaded onto a HiTrap SP FF 1 ml cation exchange column. l-Arginine and l-glutamic acid at a final concentration of 50 mm were added to the eluted protein solution. expression and purification of NsP2 Variants were performed as described above. nsP2 was dialyzed against buffer E (50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol), loaded onto a cation exchange column, and gradient-eluted with buffer E containing 1.5 m NaCl. ion exchange step was bypassed because of low protein yield. spectra were derived from three independent acquisitions in the far-UV region, ranging from 185 to 260 nm with an interval of 1 nm at 20 \u00b0C for each individual protein, at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. the final CD spectra were processed to be expressed as mean residue ellipticity. the reaction was allowed to proceed for 7\u201310 min. the changes in the slope/min were calculated from the change in the slope/min. the specific activities of N470, His-nsP2, and nsP2 were calculated. the reaction was initiated by the addition of ATP to a concentration 0.5 mm. the final reaction volume was 200 l. the reaction was conducted using 500 m ATP as a substrate. a plot of initial velocity (vertical axes) versus GTP concentration (horizontal axes) in GTPase reactions for N470, His-nsP2 and nsP2 is shown. the data presented in each panel represent the average of at least three independent experiments. oligonucleotides 1 and 3 were used to prepare substrates with blunt ends. oligonucleotides 1 and 5 were used to prepare substrates with a 6-base 5\u2032 overhang. oligonucleotides 5 and 7 were used to obtain a fork substrate with both 12-base 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 overhangs at one end. the concentrations of the labeled dsRNA or dsDNA were estimated by measuring the radioactivity of a small aliquot of substrates using a Tri-Carb 2810TR liquid scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) the reaction volume was 15 l, and a 20-min preincubation was performed at 22 \u00b0C. a 5-l aliquot was

N470 was incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5 with 0\u201310 mm MgCl2. on the GTPase activity was analyzed by mixing all the reaction components in a volume of 200 l. the reaction was initiated by adding GTP to a final concentration of 100 m. the activity of the purine-nucleoside phosphorylase enzyme involved in the EnzChek Phosphate Assay kit (Invitrogen) was additionally tested at the indicated temperatures using only standard phosphate solution. oligonucleotides 1 and 2 were used to prepare substrates with a 12-base 3\u2032 overhang. oligonucleotides 1 and 5 were used to prepare substrates with a 12-base 5\u2032 overhang. oligonucleotides 1 and 5 were used to prepare substrates with a 12-base 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 overhang at one end. radioactive dsRNA or dsDNA products were detected via brief exposure of the gel to x-ray film. the gel was crushed after which nucleic acids were eluted through overnight incubation at 4 \u00b0C. the probes were centrifuged at 6000 g for 5 min. the reaction volume was 15 l, and a 20-min preincubation was performed at 22 \u00b0C. the reaction mixtures were subsequently split equally into three tubes. ATP and magnesium acetate in complex (ATP-Mg2+) were added to a final concentration of 3.5 mm to one tube. aliquots of the reaction mixtures were collected at selected time points. each aliquot was mixed with stop buffer and analyzed as described above. reaction mixtures contained 50 pm dsRNA substrate, 12.5 nm enzyme, and 3.5 mm ATP-Mg2+ in a standard helicase assay buffer. the effects of different metal ions on the helicase activity of nsP2 were analyzed in reactions containing 50 pm dsRNA substrate, 12.5 nm enzyme, the indicated metal acetate or chloride at 3.5 mm, and 3.5 mm ATP. in all experiments, the dsRNA with the 12-base 5\u2032 overhang was used as a substrate. ssRNAs (50 pm) obtained through heat denaturation of indicated dsRNAs were used as substrates for testing the RNA annealing activity of N470, nsP2 or His-nsP2 at a 12.5 nm concentration. the reactions were carried out at 22 \u00b0C in the presence of 0.5 mm Mg2+ and 1 mm NaCl in a final volume of 60 l. nsP2 was processed using the Protein Homology/Analogy Recognition Engine (PHYRE) and PHYRE 2 (32), I-TASSER (33), and MODELLER (34). pET-His-nsP2 encoded CHIKV nsP2 preceded by aa sequence MNHHHHHH-SGGGS-ENLYFQ. expression vectors designated pET-N470-K192A, pET-N470-D252A, and pET-N470-E253A were generated via PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis. to this end, nsP2-delN2 (deletion of aa 1\u20132 at the N terminus of nsP2) and nsP2-insN2 (addition of GA dipeptide to the N termin protein expression was conducted at 23 \u00b0C with shaking at 150 rpm for an additional 16\u201318 h. cells were harvested via centrifugation and resuspended in 40 ml of lysis buffer A (50 mm Na2HPO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol, and 0.5 mm Pefabloc SC) the fraction containing N470 without the affinity tag was dialyzed against buffer C (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 50 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol) the protein solution was loaded onto a HiTrap SP FF 1 ml cation exchange column (GE Healthcare) and was gradient-eluted with buffer C containing 1.5 m NaCl. l-Arginine and l-glutamic acid at a final concentration of mutant proteins nsP2-delNTD and nsP2-delMTL were purified. the ion exchange step was bypassed because of low protein yield. the subsequent purification steps were identical to the protocol used for the purification of his-nsP2. mean spectra were derived from three independent acquisitions in the far-UV region, ranging from 185 to 260 nm with an interval of 1 nm at 20 \u00b0C for each individual protein, at a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. the final CD spectra were processed to be expressed as mean residue ellipticity. the changes in the slope/min were calculated from the change in the slope/min, and the specific activities of N470, His-nsP2 and nsP2 were calculated. the reaction was initiated by the addition of ATP to a concentration 0.5 mm. the final reaction volume was 200 l. Km, Kcat, and the enzyme efficiency (Kcat/Km) were calculated using the double reciprocal Lineweaver-Burk plot. the effect of the temperature on the GTPase activity was analyzed by mixing all the reaction components in a volume of 200 l as described for the standard NTPase assay. the kinetic parameters are summarized in Table 3. D, relative GTPase activities of the N470 and different nsP2 variants compared with the activity of WT nsP2. The final concentration of each oligonucleotide in the reaction mixture was 1.75 m. oligonucleotides 1 and 5 were used to prepare substrates with a 6-base 5\u2032 overhang. oligonucleotides 5 and 7 were used to obtain a fork substrate with both 12-base 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 overhangs at one end. mixtures were prepared in 15 l of buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2 and 20 mm KCl. 50 pm labeled dsRNA or 50 pm labeled dsDNA as a substrate was incubated with 12.5 nm recombinant enzymes in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 2 mm DTT, and 10 mm NaCl. the reaction volume was 15 l, and a 20-min preincubation was performed at 22 \u00b0C. a 5-l aliquot was collected prior to the addition of 3.5 mm ATP-Mg2+ and 5 nm trap oligonucleotide 3. the RNA oligonucleotide was used as a trap except in the case of the 24-base 5\u2032 overhang substrate. each aliquot was mixed with stop buffer and analyzed as described above. the effect of pH on the helicase activity of nsP2 was analyzed in reactions containing 50 pm dsRNA substrate, 12.5 nm enzyme, 3.5 mm Mg2+, and a 3.5 mm concentration of each NTP or dNTP. the effects of different metal ions on the helicase activity of nsP2 were analyzed in reactions containing 50 pm dsRNA substrate, 12.5 nm enzyme, 3.5 mm Mg RNA Annealing Assay RNA annealing reactions were performed at 22 \u00b0C in 60 l of a reaction mixture containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 2 mm DTT, 0.5 mm Mg2+, 1 mm NaCl, and 12.5 nm enzyme without ATP. then, various dsRNA substrates at 50 pm concentration were denatured for 2 min at 95 \u00b0C and then chilled on ice for 1 min before being dsRNA with a 12-base 5\u2032 overhang annealing of oligonucleotides forming dsRNA. C, annealing of the oligonucleotides forming dsRNA with a 12-base 5\u2032 overhang. a fold highly similar to that of nsP2 protease from equine encephalitis virus. toMV-based model covered aa 1\u2013470, and it was selected to represent the possible structure of the N-terminal part of nsP2. the model predicted the folding of N470 into three distinct domains with high overall similarity to the folding of toMV-Hel. Arg-416 that may also interact with -phosphate was located in the predicted arginine finger motif (motif VI) however, we were unable to identify a classical nucleobase-binding pocket in our three-dimensional model. nsP2 as an RNA triphosphatase is expected to accommodate not only NTP but also RNA substrates. an analogous strict dependence on the identity of the N-terminal aa residue was observed for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity of alphaviral nsP4 (49). a head-to-head comparison of the properties of the N-terminally tagged recombinant protein (His-nsP2) and the protein with an authentic N terminus (nsP2) was performed throughout this study. yields of N470-K192A, N470-D252A, and N470-E253A were reproducibly 4\u20136-fold lower than the yield of N470. however, the obtained purified proteins were soluble and essentially free of contaminants. a segment of the protease cleavage site consisting of 6 aa residues representing the extreme C terminus of nsP3 was appended to the N terminus of nsP2. a similar approach was used for generation of the nsP2-insN2 mutants bearing addition or deletion of 2 aa residues at the N terminus of nsP2 respectively. -sheets contributed around 12% of the secondary structure elements. -sheets contributed around 12% of the secondary structure elements. nearly 24% of the structural elements were estimated to form random coils. the nsP2 variants with the deletion of NTD or MTL showed formation of high molecular weight aggregates. m % of nsP2 CHIKV nsP2 (this study) 13.32 1.01 57.69 4.33 106 100 CHIKV His-nsP2 (this study) 18.36 1.78 10.73 0.58 106 13 CHIKV N470 (this study) 11.77 2.39 10.78 0.91 106 21 CHIKV aa residues 167\u2013630 (11) 0.03a 0.50 SFV aa residues 1\u2013470 V nsP2 was found to be an even more efficient NTPase than N470 or His-nsP2 whose activities were only 21 and 13% of the activity of nsP2 respectively. in our experiments, nsP2-delNTD and nsP2-delMTL were not capable of performing NTP hydrolysis (data not shown) but because these proteins also showed signs of aggregation, it is not possible to reconcile whether NTD and MTL the maximum stimulatory effect was observed in the presence of poly(dC) and poly(dG) oligonucleotides (up to 2.5-fold) the presence of poly(G) oligonucleotide appeared to reduce the activity of these enzymes. similar levels of stimulation were also observed for the nsP2-delN2 and nsP2-insN2 mutants. a set of DNA and RNA oligonucleotides was used to generate substrates with identical 16-base pair ds regions but different 5\u2032 and/or 3\u2032 overhangs. to reveal substrate specificity and polarity of the CHIKV nsP2 helicase, a set of DNA and RNA oligonucleotides (Table 1) was used to generate substrates with identical 16-base pair ds regions but different 5\u2032 and/or 3 nsP2 is a 5\u2032 overhang-dependent RNA helicase. the assay was performed using different types of dsDNA substrates at 50 pm concentration. nsP2 is a 5\u2032 overhang-dependent RNA helicase. nsP2 releases both ssRNAs from the dsRNA substrate. the experimental conditions were identical to those shown in B. the labeling of the 16-base ssRNA reproducibly resulted in an artifact band at a position that corresponded almost exactly to that of the labeled 28-base ssRNA. the effect of the N-terminal tag on RNA helicase activity was relatively mild compared with its effect on NTPase activity. nsP2-insN2 and nsP2-delN2 mutants were also found to have RNA helicase activities essentially indistinguishable from that of nsP2. the dsRNA contains the labeled 28-base strand and the unlabeled 16-base strand that was used as a trap RNA. this dsRNA exhibits a 3\u2032 overhang and cannot be unwound by nsP2. nsP2 is a 5\u2032 Overhang-dependent Non-processive Helicase. the 24-base 5\u2032 ss region of the dsRNA substrate may accommodate multiple copies of nsP2 molecules. a larger fraction of the substrate with a 24-base 5\u2032 overhang was unwound compared with the 12-base 5\u2032 overhang. the presence of N470 in the reaction mixture did not have any effect on this process, indicating that this recombinant protein lacks RNA annealing activity. nsP2 performed only slightly better in the reaction that led to the formation of dsRNA with a 12-base 5\u2032 overhang. the ability of nsP2 and His-nsP2 to unwind the dsRNA substrate was assayed in the presence of 8\u2013163 mm NaCl. nsP2 demonstrated robust helicase activity at a salt concentration 16 mm. at higher concentrations, its enzymatic activity declined rapidly. both nsP2 and His-nsP2 showed comparable RNA helicase activity. if anything, the UTP, dCTP, and dGTP were slightly less favored. nsP2 RNA helicase activity on different types of metal ions was analyzed. three-dimensional structure of fragment corresponding to CHIKV nsP2 (aa 471\u2013791) has been resolved at 2.4- resolution (Protein Data Bank code 3TRK), revealing a fold highly similar to that of nsP2 protease from Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus. a homology modeling approach was used to predict the folding pattern of N470 using the I-TASSER (33), MODELLER (34), and PHY all known SF1 and SF2 helicases contain RecA-like domains. two of these domains (domains 1A and 2A) were predicted to exist in N470. aa residues were predicted based on their likeliness to interact with -phosphate. Arg-416 that may also interact with -phosphate was located in the predicted arginine finger motif (motif VI) however, we were unable to identify a classical nucleobase-binding pocket in our three-dimensional model. this pocket may be flexible in nsP2 because nsP2 as an RNA triphosphatase is expected to accommodate not only NTP but also RNA substrates. n-terminal aa residue of nsP2 originates from proteolytic cleavage of polyprotein precursor. any extra or missing aa residues were previously found to strongly diminish the ability of nsP2 to cleave the site between nsP2 and nsP3 in the case of SFV. a head-to-head comparison of the properties of the N-terminally tagged recombinant protein (His-ns the yields of N470-K192A, N470-D252A, and N470-E253A were reproducibly 4\u20136-fold lower than the yield of N470. however, the obtained purified proteins were soluble and essentially free of contaminants. a segment of the protease cleavage site consisting of 6 aa residues representing the extreme C terminus of nsP3 was appended to the N terminus of nsP2. the introduced cleavage site sequence was efficiently recognized and cleaved by the protease activity of nsP2 itself. different variants of nsP2 and N470 proteins were analyzed for their ability to hydrolyze eight canonical NTPs and dNTPs. however, N470-K192A, N470-D252A, and N470-E253A were completely inactive (data not shown) CHIKV aa residues 167\u2013630 (11) 0.03a 0.50 SFV aa residues 1\u2013470 (9) 90 4 0.04 106 1 a The Km value was 29.1 nm, so only the basal Kcat value was compared with other studies. ATP hydrolysis by N470 was active over a wide range of Mg2+ concentrations. nsP2-delNTD and nsP2-delMTL were not capable of performing NTP hydrolysis (data not shown) but because these proteins also showed signs of aggregation. it is not possible to reconcile whether NTD and MTL accessory domains located outside of the RecA-like core may contribute to the coordination of NTP hydrolysis by nsP2. poly(dC) and poly(dG) oligonucleotides appear to reduce activity of these enzymes. similar levels of stimulation were also observed for the nsP2-delN2 and nsP2-insN2 mutants. similar levels of stimulation were also observed for the nsP2-delN2 mutants. a set of DNA and RNA oligonucleotides was used to generate substrates with identical 16-base pair ds regions but different 5\u2032 and/or 3\u2032 overhangs. in a standard helicase assay, the molar ratio of enzyme to substrate was maintained at 250:1 to allow the excess of the enzyme to act as a ssRNA- or ssDNA-binding protein to prevent the displaced strands from reannealing to their nsP2 exhibits 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 directional RNA helicase activity. the assay was performed using different types of dsRNA substrates at 50 pm concentration and 12.5 nm nsP2, His-nsP2, or N470 in the presence or absence of 3.5 mm ATP-Mg2+. both strands of the substrate with the 12-base 5\u2032 overhang were labeled. the labeling of the 16-base ssRNA reproducibly resulted in an artifact band (visible on lane 2) at a position that corresponded almost exactly to that of the labeled 28-base ssRNA. the helicase activity of nsP2 is clearly evident from the increase in the signal intensity at the position corresponding to 28-base ssRNA. the effect of the N-terminal tag on RNA helicase activity was relatively mild compared with its effect on NTPase activity. in line with these findings, the nsP2-insN2 and nsP2-delN2 mutants were also found to have RNA helicase activities essentially indistinguishable from that of nsP2. dsRNA exhibits a 3\u2032 overhang and cannot be unwound by nsP2. nsP2 is a 5\u2032 overhang-dependent non-processive Helicase. a larger fraction of the substrate with a 24-base 5\u2032 overhang was unwound compared with the substrate with the 12-base 5\u2032 overhang. the formation of the ssRNA product occurred rapidly only during the first 10\u201315 min of the reaction. 470 in the reaction mixture did not have any effect on this process. this recombinant protein lacks RNA annealing activity. nsP2 performed only slightly better in the reaction that led to the formation of dsRNA with a 12-base 5\u2032 overhang. nsP2 showed robust helicase activity at a salt concentration 16 mm. at higher concentrations, its enzymatic activity declined rapidly. his-nsP2 was remarkably more resistant to increased concentrations of NaCl. no significant difference was detected between the behavior of nsP2 and His-nsP2. dCTP, and dGTP were slightly less favored. nsP2 RNA helicase activity on different types of metal ions was analyzed. all other tested divalent cations (Mn2+, Zn2+, and Ca2+) resulted in strongly diminished and nearly equivalent RNA helicase activities of both nsP2 and His-nsP2. the three-dimensional structure of the remaining segment of nsP2 is still not known. a homology modeling approach was used to predict the folding pattern of N470 using the I-TASSER (33), MODELLER (34), and PHYRE 2 and PHYRE (32) on-line servers. the best model proposed by the PHYRE server was based on the structure of Upf1 helicase (Protein Data Bank code 2GJK (45) two of these domains (domains 1A and 2A) were predicted to exist in N470. aa residues were predicted based on their likeliness to interact with Mg2+, nucleobase, ribose ring, and - and -phosphate groups. nsP2 as an RNA triphosphatase is expected to accommodate not only NTP but also RNA substrates. aa residues demonstrated to interact with different moieties of the NTP molecule, incoming water molecules, and Mg2+ cations. nsP2's aa residue originates from the proteolytic cleavage of the polyprotein precursor. nsP2's aa residues were previously found to weaken the ability of nsP2 to cleave the site between nsP2 and nsP3 in the case of SFV. a head-to-head comparison of the properties of the N-terminally tagged recombinant protein (His-n yields of N470-K192A, N470-D252A, and N470-E253A were reproducibly 4\u20136-fold lower than the yield of N470. however, the obtained purified proteins were soluble and essentially free of contaminants. a segment of the protease cleavage site consisting of 6 aa residues representing the extreme C terminus of nsP3 was appended to the N terminus of nsP2. a similar approach was used for generation of the nsP2-insN2 mutants bearing addition or deletion of 2 aa residues at the N terminus of nsP2 respectively. the recombinant proteins representing different fragments from alphaviral nsP2s have been shown to exhibit NTP hydrolysis rate that is lower (9\u201311) than would be characteristic for SF1 helicases (31). to understand this discrepancy, different variants of nsP2 and N470 proteins were analyzed for their ability to hydrolyze eight canonical NTPs and dNTPs. aa residues 167\u2013630 (11) 0.03a 0.50 SFV aa residues 1\u2013470 (9) 90 4 0.04 106 1 a The Km value was 29.1 nm. ATP hydrolysis by N470 was active over a wide range of Mg2+ concentrations. however, the highest activity was observed at a Mg2+:substrate concentration ratio of 6:1. nsP2-delNTD and nsP2-delMTL were not capable of performing NTP hydrolysis. but because these proteins also showed signs of aggregation, it is not possible to reconcile whether NTD and MTL accessory domains located outside of the RecA-like core may contribute to the coordination of NTP hydrolysis by nsP2. on the other hand, it was found that deletion or addition of few aa residues as in case of nsP similar levels of stimulation were also observed for the nsP2-delN2 and nsP2-insN2 mutants. comparable moderate degrees of stimulation have been reported previously for a recombinant protein corresponding to a fragment of ns polyprotein from Rubella virus (53) the presence of the authentic N-terminal region and the C-terminal part of nsP2 contribute to the specific activity of its NTPase domain. ucleotides were used to generate substrates with identical 16-base pair ds regions but different 5\u2032 and/or 3\u2032 overhangs. in a standard helicase assay, the molar ratio of enzyme to substrate was maintained at 250:1 to allow the excess of the enzyme to act as a ssRNA- or ssDNA-binding protein to prevent the displaced strands from reannealing to their complements. NsP2 was nsP2 exhibits 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 directional RNA helicase activity. both the RNA helicase and to a lesser extent NTPase activities depend on the narrowly defined \u201cNTPase region\u201d but also on the remote elements of this protein. the presence of a small affinity tag had a profound effect on the NTPase activity of nsP2. both nsP2 and His-nsP2 were capable of unwinding the dsRNA substrates with rather similar kinetics. nsP2-insN2 and nsP2-delN2 mutants were found to have RNA helicase activities essentially indistinguishable from that of nsP2. the assay was conducted using different types of dsRNA substrates at 50 pm and 12.5 nm nsP2 or His-nsP2 in the absence (lane 2) or presence (lanes 3\u20139) of 3.5 mm ATP-Mg2+.

AUw and ARw, final reaction amplitude. a larger fraction of the substrate with a 24-base 5\u2032 overhang was unwound compared with the substrate with the 12-base 5\u2032 overhang. the formation of the ssRNA product occurred rapidly only during the first 10\u201315 min of the reaction. nsP2 may exhibit intrinsic RNA annealing activity that is reportedly an ATP-independent process (60) nsP2 and His-nsP2 were relatively inefficient in carrying out the reaction with substrates leading to the formation of dsRNA with a 12-base 5\u2032 overhang. nsP2 performed only slightly better in the reaction that led to the formation of dsRNA with a 24-base 5\u2032 overhang. his-nsP2 and his-nsP2 were active over a wide range of pH values. nsP2 and his-nsP2 showed comparable RNA helicase activity with all these substrates. nsP2 and his-nsP2 showed comparable RNA helicase activity with all these substrates. a typical bell-shaped temperature dependence of the GTPase activity of nsP2 was also affected by temperature variation, showing the maximum around 27 \u00b0C. the helicase activity of nsP2 was also affected by temperature variation, showing the maximum around 27 \u00b0C. aa 471\u2013791) has been resolved at 2.4- resolution (Protein Data Bank code 3TRK) the three-dimensional structure of the remaining segment of nsP2 is still not known. a homology modeling approach was used to predict the folding pattern of N470 using the I-TASSER (33), MODELLER (34), and PHYRE 2 and PHYRE (32) on-line servers. the aa residues were predicted based on their likeliness to interact with Mg2+, nucleobase, ribose ring, and - and -phosphate groups. these residues were distributed across the classical motifs of recA-like domains at positions similar to the motifs found in the three-dimensional structures of Upf1 (45), PcrA (26), and ToMV-Hel (44) helicases. nsP2 as an RNA triphosphatase is expected to accommodate not only NTP but also RNA substrates. nsP2 as an RNA triphosphatase may occur because nsP2 is expected to accommodate not only NTP but also RNA substrates. nsP2 originates from the proteolytic cleavage of the polyprotein precursor. any extra or missing aa residues were previously found to strongly diminish the ability of nsP2 to cleave the site between nsP2 and nsP3 in the case of SFV (30). a strict dependence on the identity of the N-terminal aa residue was observed for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity of alphaviral ns -D252A, and N470-E253A containing mutations in motifs I and II were reproducibly 4\u20136-fold lower than the yield of N470. however, the obtained purified proteins were soluble and essentially free of contaminants. a segment of the protease cleavage site consisting of 6 aa residues representing the extreme C terminus of nsP3 was appended to the N terminus of nsP2. the introduced cleavage site sequence was efficiently recognized and cleaved by the protease activity of nsP2 itself. the modified purification strategy resulted in pure nsP2. the recombinant proteins representing different fragments from alphaviral nsP2s have been shown to exhibit NTP hydrolysis rate that is lower (9\u201311) than would be characteristic for SF1 helicases (31). to understand this discrepancy, different variants of nsP2 and N470 proteins were analyzed for their ability to hydrolyze eight canonical NTPs and dNTPs. the basal Kcat value was 29.1 nm, so only the basal Kcat value was compared with other studies. ATP hydrolysis by N470 was active over a wide range of Mg2+ concentrations. however, the highest activity was observed at a Mg2+:substrate concentration ratio of 6:1. elution profiles in size exclusion chromatography and CD spectroscopy data analysis. it is not possible to reconcil whether NTD and MTL accessory domains located outside of the RecA-like core may contribute to the coordination of NTP hydrolysis by nsP2. on the other hand, it was found that deletion or addition of few aa residues as in case of nsP2-delN2 or nsP2-insN2 resulted in active enzymes the authentic N-terminal region and the C-terminal part of nsP2 contribute to the specific activity of its NTPase domain. both the authentic N-terminal region and the C-terminal part of nsP2 contribute to the specific activity of its NTPase domain. this may result from either the stabilization of a favorable active conformation of the enzyme or the provision of additional structural elements. molar ratio was maintained at 250:1 to allow the excess of the enzyme to act as a ssRNA- or ssDNA-binding protein to prevent the displaced strands from reannealing to their complements. NsP2 was also unable to unwind dsRNA substrates with a 12-base 3\u2032 overhang, blunt ends, or a 6-base 5\u2032 overhang. however, this protein was capable of unwinding the dsRNA substrate the presence of the C-terminal part of nsP2 is an absolute requirement for the RNA helicase activity of this protein. both the RNA helicase and to a lesser extent NTPase activities of nsP2 depend not only on the narrowly defined \u201cNTPase region\u201d but also on the remote elements. the presence of a small affinity tag had a profound effect on the NTPase activity of nsP2. both nsP2 and His-nsP2 were capable of unwinding the dsRNA substrates with rather similar kinetics. the assay was conducted using different types of dsRNA substrates at 50 pm and 12.5 nm nsP2 or His-nsP2 in the absence (lane 2) or presence (lanes 3\u20139) of 3.5 mm ATP-Mg2+. the dsRNA heated at 95 \u00b0C was used as marker for ssRNA (lane 1). dsRNA formed % of dsRNA formed 12-Base 5\u2032 overhang 24.3 5.0 48.0 6.7 14.2 5.4 24.6 4.3 3.5 1.8 9.8 0.4 23.9 0.4 45.4 1.0 24-Base 5\u2032 overhang 34.7 1.7 54.3 1.7 33.9 0.3 29.9 2.3b 11.4 1.9 16.7 4.3 30.4 2.5 39.5 1.5 12-Base 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 overhangs (fork) 20.1 0.8 36.1 a larger fraction of the substrate with a 24-base 5\u2032 overhang was unwound compared with the substrate with the 12-base 5\u2032 overhang. nsP2 was relatively inefficient in carrying out the reaction with substrates leading to the formation of dsRNA with a 12-base 5\u2032 overhang. the highest nsP2 annealing activity was observed for substrates leading to formation of dsRNA with fork structure. nsP2 demonstrated robust helicase activity at a salt concentration 16 mm. nsP2 and His-nsP2 were more resistant to increased concentrations of NaCl. no significant difference was detected between the behavior of nsP2 and his-nsP2. helicase activity of nsP2 does not depend on the type of NTP or dNTPs. nsP2 and his-nsP2 are a multifunctional protein, and it has been classified as an SF1 helicase based on its sequence. nsP2 is a multifunctional protein, and it has been classified as an SF1 helicase based on its sequence (24, 63). his-nsP2, a variant of nsP2 with an N-terminal His6 tag, possessed reduced RNA unwinding activity and enhanced rewinding activity. N470, a protein lacking the C-terminal region of nsP2, displayed similarly reduced NTPase activity but no detectable RNA-modulating activity. two additional domains are present in these proteins compared with N470. the penultimate papain-like protease domain of nsP2 exhibits an isoelectric point (pI) of 8.4, whereas the MTL domain of nsP2 has a calculated pI of 10.13, thus becoming a likely candidate for a nucleic acid-binding domain. previous study using alanine scanning of positively charged residues in the MTL domain of Sindbis virus (alphavirus) nsP2 revealed very different effects of these substitutions on the infectivity of viral RNA, virus growth characteristics, and polyprotein processing (66). several of these mutants showed severe defects with lethal or temperature-sensitive phenotypes, indicating perturbations in most important viral functions. terminal segment of nsP2 contributes to the stabilization of such conformation of nsP2 that allows for its maximal enzymatic activity. deletion or addition of just a few aa residues already has an effect on enzymatic properties. this method did not reveal any significant structural differences between protein variants. this implies that fine conformational adjustments could be responsible for the observed changes in enzymatic properties. cytoplasm, in the nucleus (71), and within the virus replication-induced spherules, which are first assembled at the plasma membrane and then fused with endolysosomes (72) nsP2 helicase demonstrates sensitivity to salt concentration (Fig. 7A) the significance of the RNA helicases in the life cycle of positive-strand RNA viruses, including alphaviruses, is poorly understood. reversions in the viral genome are only possible if the virus is capable of RNA copying at all. it can be concluded that the activities associated with the viral site of nsP2 are dispensable for at least some early stages of viral RNA replication. however, it remains to be revealed which of the enzymatic activities of SFV nsP2 affected by Walker motif mutation was most critical and required a repair. nsP2 failed to unwind the dsRNA substrate with a considerably longer 6-base 5\u2032 overhang. it is unlikely that these RNA structures are suitable for nsP2 binding in infected cells. a speculative model in which both the RNA helicase and RNA annealing activities of nsP2 may be involved. the SF1 helicase of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus exhibits enzymatic activities toward both RNA and DNA duplexes. it remains to be discovered whether a strict RNA preference is a common property of alphaviral helicases."}
