{"summary": "two recently emerged CoVs, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have demonstrated their potential to become a serious threat to public health. evidence suggests bats may serve as zoonotic reservoirs for MERS-CoV (15, 16) 3CLpro is an important target for therapeutic intervention against coronavirus infections (27\u201333) a number of kinetic, biophysical, and x-ray structural studies have demonstrated that SARS-CoV 3CLpro is only active in vitro as a tightly associated dimer with a dimer dissociation constant (Kd) at either the N or C terminus drastically reduces the enzymatic rate. kinetic, biophysical and x-ray structural studies provide evidence for a weakly associated MERS-CoV 3CLpro dimer. we used our previous knowledge on the design of potent SARS-CoV 3CLpro peptidic inhibitors to design a series of inhibitors. cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 g for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C. pellets were stored at 80 \u00b0C until further use. cell debris was removed from the cleared lysate by centrifuging at 29,000 g for 30 min. protein was eluted using a 5 column volume (300 ml) linear gradient to 100% Buffer A. Fractions (12 ml) were collected, and those containing MERS-CoV 3CLpro were pooled (120 ml) and exchanged into 2 liters of Buffer A via overnight dialysis. protein was eluted using a 25 column volume (200 ml) and a linear gradient to 50% Buffer E (50 mm MES, pH 5.5, 1 m NaCl, 0.05 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 5 mm BME) Fractions (2 ml) were collected, and those containing MERS-CoV 3CLpro were pooled and concentrated to 5 mg/ml.

Fractions (2 ml) were collected, and those containing MERS-CoV 3CLpro were pooled (total volume of 34 ml) and concentrated to 5 mg/ml. protein was eluted isocratically at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with Buffer F. compounds 1\u20135 showed 50% inhibition of MERS-CoV 3CLpro. kinact, t1/2 and KI were not determined (nd) for these compounds. the rate of enzymatic activity was determined at 25 \u00b0C by following the increase in fluorescence (excitation = 485 nm, emission = 528 nm, bandwidths = 20 nm) of hilyte FluorTM-488 upon peptide hydrolysis by the enzyme as a function of time. 3CLpro enzymes cannot be saturated with this substrate at a substrate concentration that would still allow accurate fluorescent measurements without the inner filter effect. only the apparent kcat/Km values can be determined from the slope of the line that results from a plot of the enzymatic activity against the substrate concentration (x axis) DMSO stocks (100) of compounds were diluted a hundred-fold to a final concentration of 50 m in 80 l of the enzyme solution and incubated for 20 min. after 20 min, the enzymatic activity was measured as initial slope of the progress curve. kinact defines the maximum rate of inactivation at infinite inhibitor concentration, and KI defines the concentration of inhibitor that yields a rate of inactivation equal to 12kinact. sedimentation velocity experiments were performed on the Beckman-Coulter XLA ultracentrifuge using varying concentrations of MERS-CoV 3CLpro (4\u201323 m) samples were prepared by mixing 25 m MERS-CoV 3CLpro with 25, 50, and 100 m compound 6 or 10. a zero-inhibitor control reaction was set up by mixing DMSO to a final concentration of 1% into 80 l of enzyme solution. crystals of MERS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitor complexes suitable for x-ray diffraction were grown by the hanging-drop, vapor diffusion method at 20 \u00b0C. crystals were flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen after dragging them through a cryo-solution that contained the crystallization solution supplemented with 15% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol. the method of molecular replacement was used to obtain initial phases using the program PHASER-MR in Phenix suite version 1.8.4 (47). the final MERS-CoV 3CLpro and 6 complex structure was then refined using iterative cycles of refinement coupled to manual model building using COOT (48) based on Fo Fc and 2Fo Fc maps. gene encoding 3CLpro protease of MERS-CoV was codon-optimized for optimal expression in E. coli. gene was subcloned into pET-11a expression vector with an N-terminal His6 tag followed by the nsp4nsp5 auto-cleavage site. solid ammonium sulfate was added to the cleared lysate to a final concentration of 1 m through gradual mixing on ice. the column was then washed with 5 column volume (300 ml) of Buffer B at a flow rate of 4 ml/min. Fractions (6 ml) were collected, and those containing MERS-CoV 3CLpro were pooled (66 ml) and dialyzed for 4 h in 4 liters of Buffer D (20 mm MES, pH 5.5, 0.05 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 5 mm BME) the concentrated protein sample was loaded onto the preparation grade Superdex 75 26/60 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with Buffer F (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT)) protein was eluted isocratically at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with Buffer F. the stereochemistry at the benzyl stereocenter of compound 5 is a 1:1 mixture of enantiomers. therefore, the compound was tested as a mixture of diastereomers. assays were conducted in black, half-area, 96-well plates (Corning Glass) using a final reaction volume of 100 l. the resulting florescence was monitored using a bioTek Synergy H1 plate reader. all reactions were carried out in triplicate. the enzymatic activity (y axis) was normalized against the substrate concentration (x axis) the final enzyme concentrations were varied over a concentration range from 2 m to 100 nm for MERS-CoV 3CLpro, 500 to 10 nm for SARS-CoV 3CLpro, 250 to 0.6 nm for HKU5-CoV 3CLpro. DMSO stocks (100) of compounds were diluted a hundred-fold to a final concentration of 50 m in 80 l of the enzyme solution. after 20 min, the enzymatic activity was measured as initial slope of the progress curve, obtained by initiating the reaction with 20 l of 5 m substrate. kinact defines the maximum rate of inactivation at infinite inhibitor concentration, and KI defines the concentration of inhibitor that yields a rate of inactivation equal to 12kinact. sedimentation velocity experiments were performed at 20 \u00b0C on the Beckman-Coulter XLI ultracentrifuge using different concentrations of MERS-CoV 3CLpro. sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed at concentrations of 3 and 17 m MERS-CoV 3CLpro. the experiments were performed at 20 \u00b0C utilizing a two-channel centerpiece. determination Purified MERS-CoV 3CLpro was concentrated to 1.6 mg/ml in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 2.5 mm DTT. crystals of MERS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitor complexes suitable for x-ray diffraction were grown by the hanging-drop, vapor diffusion method at 20 \u00b0C. the x-ray structure of SARS-CoV 3CLpro was used as a phasing model (32) the final MERS-CoV 3CLpro and 6 complex structure was then used to calculate the initial phases for the MERS-CoV 3CLpro and 11 complex model. each structure was then refined using iterative cycles of refinement coupled to manual model building using COOT. Approximately 12 mg of highly pure MERS-CoV 3CLpro can be obtained per liter of bacterial cell culture. a summary of the percent enzyme yield, total activity units, and the fold-purification after each chromatographic step is summarized in Table 1. 3CLpro Enzymes A FRET-based peptide substrate was used to measure the enzymatic activity of MERS-CoV 3CLpro. the slope of the kinetic response of MERS-CoV 3CLpro to increasing substrate concentration was determined to derive an apparent (kcat/Km) value. the slope of the kinetic response of MERS-CoV 3CLpro to increasing substrate concentration was determined to derive an apparent (kcat/Km) value. a dimer has consistently been shown to be the catalytically active form of all 3CLpro enzymes studied to date. we tested the hypothesis that the lower enzymatic efficiency of MERS-CoV 3CLpro is a result of the reduction in its ability to dimerize. shaded box represents the data that are plotted in B. enlarged view of the fitted data at low total enzyme concentrations. it is immediately apparent from the data plotted in Fig. 2 that the response of enzymatic activity to an increasing enzyme concentration is nonlinear. kinetic dataa kcatb Kd min1 m MERS-CoV 0.2 0.02 7.8 1.3 SARS-CoV 0.47 0.03 0.06 0.01 HKU5-CoV 0.53 0.02 0.06 0.01 HKU4-CoV 0.84 0.07 0.1 0.03 a Values were determined through nonlinear fitting of the kinetic data to Equation 2. the lower kcat value for MERS-CoV 3CLpro indicates a moderate reduction (2\u20134 compounds 6\u20139 displayed more than 50% inhibition of MERS-CoV 3CLpro. they were further evaluated for their ability to inactivate the enzyme in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. kinetic progress curves for compound 6 were fit to the appropriate equations. compound 9 inhibited SARS-CoV 3CLpro by 76%. KI values of compounds 6\u20139 for HKU5-CoV 3CLpro are 0.39 0.14, 0.50 0.17, 0.85 0.33, and 0.64 0.25 m. MERS-CoV 3CLpro displayed a continuous size distribution at different protein concentrations. two distinct peaks corresponding to monomer (2.9 S) and dimer (3.9 S) species are observed. the dimer peak becoming more pronounced at higher enzyme concentrations. the best fit value for AUC-SV-calculated Kd is 52 5 m. a significant shift in the 2.9S peak (monomer) to a 4.1S peak (dimer) is detected upon addition of increasing concentrations of compounds 6 and 10. compound 6 acts as a substrate mimetic and mechanism-based inhibitor, also known as a suicide substrate. compound 6 acts as a substrate mimetic and react with the active site cysteine of cysteine proteases to covalently modify them. incubation of a normal peptide substrate with the enzyme would lead to immediate hydrolysis of the substrate and dissociation of the products from the enzyme. enzymatic activity of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 m MERS-CoV 3CLpro was measured in the absence and presence of varying concentrations of compound 10. inhibition of enzymatic activity is observed at higher inhibitor concentrations (highlighted in yellow-shaded box) the monomer-dimer equilibrium shifts toward dimer formation. substrate (S) binds in the second active site and catalysis takes place. inhibition of the enzymatic activity is observed at lower inhibitor concentrations. the activation effect was most pronounced at the lowest MERS-CoV 3CLpro concentration tested (0.5 m) inhibition by compound 10 occurred at lower compound concentrations when higher concentrations of enzyme were used. the monomer exists in equilibrium with the dimer, and their relative concentrations depend on the total enzyme concentration. a compound that mimics substrate and has higher binding affinity can act as a surrogate for the substrate. x-ray structures of the unliganded MERS-CoV 3CLpro monomer and the MERS-CoV 3CLpro covalently modified with compound 6 were unable to crystallize. x-ray data collection, processing, and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 4.

Height of each letter corresponds to the amino acid conservation at that position. the P2-backbone amide NH forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain carbonyl of Gln-192. the P2-leucine side chain atoms of the inhibitor make hydrophobic contacts with the side chains of Met-168 and Leu-49 that line the S2 subsite pocket. the smaller size of the S2 pocket in MERS-CoV 3CLpro is also consistent with the preference for a smaller leucine residue at the P2 position of cleavage sites the P3-carbonyl and P3-NH participate in hydrogen bonding interactions with the backbone NH and carbonyl of Glu-169. the P4-serine side chain is within hydrogen bonding distance of the side chain carboxamide of Gln-195 and the backbone carbonyl of Glu-169. phenyl propionamidyl occupies the S\u20321-S2 subsite, and the thiophene group binds in the S2 subsite. the phenyl ring forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain -nitrogen of conserved His-166. the central acetamide oxygen forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone NH of conserved Glu-169. x-ray crystal structures of 3CLpro dimers from MERS-CoV, HKU4-CoV, and SARS-CoV are conserved between the -CoV 2c members studied here. despite their high sequence identity, substantial differences between the ability of MERS-CoV to dimerize may play a significant role in dimer formation. side chain of Arg-4 from monomer A and Gln-127, Glu-290, and Lys-137 residues from monomer B are shown. corresponding residue in monomer B of MERS-CoV 3CLpro and HKU4-CoV 3CLpro is Met-298, which does not interact at the dimer interface. crystal structures does not reveal a clear mechanism for the monomer to dimer switch of MERS-CoV 3CLpro upon ligand binding. a remarkable number of these amino acids are present in the loop regions as gray (monomer A) and pink (monomer B) spheres. nonconserved residues present in loop regions are shown as spheres in gray and pink for monomers A and B. other nonconserved residues are represented as spheres with the corresponding chain color. nonconserved amino acid Met-61 forms hydrophobic interactions with Met-43. this loop, along with conserved residues His-166 and His-175, forms the S1 subsite for binding the P1 amino acid of the substrate. ala-171 is present on a loop, and this loop, along with conserved residues His-166 and His-175, forms the S1 subsite. production of MERS-CoV 3CLpro with Authentic N and C Termini Insertion results in autoprocessing of the His tag and overexpression of MERS-CoV 3CLpro without any N-terminal extension in E. coli BL21-DE3 cells. Approximately 12 mg of highly pure MERS-CoV 3CLpro can be obtained per liter of bacterial cell culture. MERS-CoV 3CLpro hydrolyzes a Fluorescent Peptide Substrate with lower efficiency than other 3CLpro enzymes. al His6 tag is auto-catalytically removed by MERS-CoV 3CLpro during its expression in E. coli. ERS-CoV 3CLpro is a weakly Associated Dimer because a dimer has consistently been shown to be the catalytically active form of all 3CLpro enzymes studied to date. we determined the dependence of the enzymatic activity of MERS-CoV 3CLpro on the total enzyme concentration. ing values for the apparent turnover number, kcat, and the monomer equilibrium constant, Kd, are shown in Table 2. final enzyme concentrations varied over the concentration ranges of 2 m to 100 nm for MERS-CoV 3CLpro, 500 to 10 nm for SARS-CoV 3CLpro, 250 to 0.6 nm for HKU5-CoV 3CLpro, and 200 to 10 nm for HKU4-CoV 3CLpro. the resulting values for the monomer-dimer equilibrium dissociation constant, Kd, and apparent turnover number, kcat, for each enzyme are provided in Table 2. the lower kcat value for MERS-CoV 3CLpro indicates a moderate reduction (2\u20134-fold) in its ability to turn over the substrate. compounds 6\u20139 displayed more than 50% inhibition of MERS-CoV 3CLpro. they were further evaluated for their ability to inactivate the enzyme in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. analysis of structure-activity relationships suggests that the S2 subsite pocket of MERS-CoV 3CLpro is small and can only accommodate a smaller P2-isobutyl substituent (compounds 6-9) but not bigger substituents such as P2-benzyl or P2-isobutylenyl (compounds 1-5) replacing the P4-ethoxy (compound 6) with P4-isopropoxy (compounds 7 and 8) had no effect on the inhibitor peptidomimetic compounds 6\u20139 have the potential to be developed as coronavirus 3CLpro inhibitors with broad spectrum specificity. we performed analytical ultracentrifugation sedimentation velocity (AUC-SV) studies at varying concentrations of MERS-CoV 3CLpro. 3CLpro is 150,000 times higher than the value of 0.35 nm determined for SARS-CoV 3CLpro (34). the best fit value for AUC-SV-calculated Kd is 52 5 m. MERS-CoV 3CLpro dimer is weakly associated, suggesting the enzyme exists mainly as a monomer in solution. compound 6 acts as a substrate mimetic and mechanism-based inhibitor. compound 6 acts as a substrate mimetic and mechanism-based inhibitor. the transition of MERS-CoV 3CLpro from monomer to dimer in the presence of compounds 6 and 10 suggests that the enzyme undergoes extensive dimerization upon substrate binding. to do so, we chose to use a noncovalent peptidomimetic compound (compound 10, Fig. 5A) that we previously identified as an inhibitor of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. kinetic model describing equilibrium between different species of MERS-CoV 3CLpro that are formed in the absence (blue box) and presence (green box) of a ligand. primarily exists as a monomer in solution in the absence of a ligand. inhibition by compound 10 occurred at lower compound concentrations. the monomer exists in equilibrium with the dimer, and their relative concentrations depend on the total enzyme concentration. mer kinetic studies performed at a fixed concentration of substrate at 2 m. the Kd value for the MERS-CoV 3CLpro dimer was determined to be 7.8 m, which is lower than the Kd value determined in the absence of substrate using AUC. however, even higher substrate concentrations would be required to observe substrate activation in a plot of catalytic activity versus substrate concentration.

Approximately 12 mg of highly pure MERS-CoV 3CLpro can be obtained per liter of bacterial cell culture. the molecular mass of purified MERS-CoV 3CLpro was determined by MALDI to be 33.4 kDa, which is close to the theoretical molecular mass. western blot analysis of purified MERS-CoV 3CLpro using an anti-His6 antibody also confirmed the absence of the N terminus His6 tag associated with the expression plasmid. these results demonstrate that the N-terminal His6 tag is auto-catalytically removed by MERS-CoV 3CLpro during its expression in E. coli. MERS-CoV 3CLpro was 5-fold less efficient at processing the peptide substrate when compared with SARS-CoV 3CLpro. even among the -CoVs from the same 2c genogroup, MERS-CoV 3CLpro was the least efficient enzyme. kinetic response of each CoV 3CLpro to an increasing enzyme concentration is plotted along with the fit of the data to Equation 2. resulting values for the apparent turnover number, kcat, and the monomer-dimer equilibrium constant, Kd, are shown in Table 2. Final enzyme concentrations varied over the concentration ranges of 2 m to 100 nm. the data were fit to Equation 2 (see \u201cExperimental Procedures\u201d), which considers only the dimer as the active form of the enzyme. the kinetic data for all four 3CLpro enzymes, MERS-CoV, HKU4-CoV, HKU5-CoV, and SARS-CoV, fit well to this model. erize is 78\u2013130-fold weaker than the other enzymes studied. these results indicate that the MERS-CoV 3CLpro dimer is much more weakly associated than the other coronavirus 3CLpro enzymes. these results raise questions as to the structural and mechanistic differences between the 3CLpro enzymes that ultimately regulate protease activity during coronavirus replication. compounds 6\u20139 are micromolar inhibitors of MERS-CoV 3CLpro. KI values of compounds 6\u20139 are 0.49 0.16, 0.60. compound 9 inhibits SARS-CoV 3CLpro by 76%. the KI values of compounds 6\u20139 for HKU4-CoV 3CLpro are 0.39 0.14, 0.50 0.17, 0.85 0.33, and 0.64 0.25 m, respectively. these data suggest that peptidomimetic compounds 6\u20139 have the potential to be developed as coronavirus 3CLpro inhibitors with broad spectrum specificity. the dimer affinity of MERS-CoV 3CLpro is substantially weaker than that for SARS-CoV 3CLpro. the AUC-SV calculated Kd value for MERS-CoV 3CLpro is 150,000 times higher than the value of 0.35 nm determined for SARS-CoV 3CLpro. this koff value is 1000 times slower than the koff value (101 s1) reported for SARS-CoV 3CLpro. the dimer is weakly associated, suggesting the enzyme exists mainly as a monomer in solution. compound 6 acts as a substrate mimetic and mechanism-based inhibitor. the modified enzyme was subjected to AUC studies to determine the influence of compound 6 on the monomer-dimer equilibrium. a significant shift in the area under 2.9S peak (monomer) to 4.1S peak (dimer) is detected upon addition of increasing concentrations of compound 6. enzymatic activity was plotted as a function of increasing inhibitor concentrations. inhibition of enzymatic activity is observed at higher inhibitor concentrations. kinetic model describing equilibrium between different species of MERS-CoV 3CLpro. the model of activation and inhibition suggested by the data at 1 m enzyme would predict that at higher enzyme concentrations less activation by a compound would be observed at lower inhibitor concentrations. the inhibition of activity would be detected at lower inhibitor concentrations because the equilibrium would be pushed toward dimer formation. the monomer-dimer kinetic studies performed in Fig. 2 were performed at a fixed concentration of substrate at 2 m. the Kd value for the MERS-CoV 3CLpro dimer was determined to be 7.8 m, which is lower than the Kd value determined in the absence of substrate using AUC. the MERS-CoV 3CLpro and 6 complex crystallized as a biologically relevant, symmetrical dimer in space group C2 with one monomer in the asymmetric unit. strong electron density (Fo Fc >4) was present for compound 6 within the active site. d rm.s.d. is root mean square deviation. d r.m.s.d. is root mean square deviation. d r.m.s.d. is root mean square deviation. asterisk indicates electrophilic carbon of compound 6 that forms a C\u2013S covalent bond with the active site cysteine Cys-148. carbon atoms are colored blue, and compound 6 carbon atoms are colored orange. hydrogen bonds are depicted as red dashed lines. the P\u20321-ethyl ester carbonyl is covalently bound to the active site cysteine (Cys-148) via a 1.8 bond between the -sulfur and the electrophilic -carbon of the Michael acceptor. the P\u20321-ethyl ester carbonyl, which mimics the carbonyl of the scissile bond in a substrate, forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone NH of Gly-146 that forms part sites within the polyprotein of MERS-CoV show that none of the 11 cleavage sites contain a phenylalanine residue at this position. leucine is the predominantly favored residue at this position followed by methionine. other interactions are also observed to play a significant role in stabilizing the MERS-CoV 3CLpro-compound 6 complex. the overall root mean square deviation between the C- atoms of the four chains was less than 1, with the highest C- root mean square deviation of 0.719 between chains C and D. strong electron density (Fo Fc >4) was present for compound 11 within all the four active sites of the two dimers. two arginine residues, Arg-4 and Arg-298 (Fig. 7, A\u2013C) form key interactions at the dimer interface of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. mutation of either of these amino acids results in a drastic loss of dimerization in SARS-CoV 3CLpro (36, 38) ray crystal structures of 3CLpro dimers from MERS-CoV, HKU4-CoV, and SARS-CoV are represented as spirals for -helix, arrows for. for SARS-CoV 3CLpro, residues Arg-4 and Ser-123 from monomer A and Gln-127, Glu-290, and Met-298 from monomer B are represented as spheres. Residues Val-4 and Met-298 in MERS-CoV, HKU5-CoV, HKU4-CoV 3CLpro, and Arg-4 and Arg-298 in SARS-CoV are shown in a green box. catalytic residues His-41 and Cys-148 are highlighted in a purple box. van der Waals contacts with Lys-155 of the same monomer and Thr-128 of the other monomer, is present at the end of the N-terminal finger. amino acids Thr-128, Lys-155, and Ser-158 are present within 6 of the N-terminal region. nonconserved residue Met-61 forms hydrophobic interactions with Met-43. loop containing nonconserved residue Ala-171 forms the S1 pocket. nonconserved residues Thr-183 and Met-189 are present on inter-domain loop. Glu-290 forms a salt bridge with Arg-4 across the dimer interface in SARS-CoV 3CLpro. but this interaction is not formed in MERS-CoV 3CLpro due to the substitution of Arg-4 with Val-4. residue Tyr-185, along with two other nonconserved residues, is present on the inter-domain loop that connects the catalytic fold (domains I and II) with the extra-helical domain III. the molecular mass of purified MERS-CoV 3CLpro was determined by MALDI to be 33.4 kDa. this is close to the theoretical molecular mass of 33.3 kDa for the authentic/mature MERS-CoV 3CLpro monomer. Western blot analysis of purified MERS-CoV 3CLpro using an anti-His6 antibody also confirmed the absence of the N terminus His6 tag associated with the expression plasmid. the enzymatic efficiency of MERS-CoV 3CLpro is noticeably lower than other 3CLpro enzymes tested. kcat/Km = 3.1 0.03 102 m1 min1) is 5-fold less efficient at processing the peptide substrate when compared with SARS-CoV 3CLpro. enzymatic activity of MERS-CoV 3CLpro is a result of the reduction in its ability to dimerize. we compared it with other 3CLpro enzymes from HKU4, HKU5 and SARS coronaviruses. kinetic response of each CoV 3CLpro to increasing enzyme concentration is plotted. a fit of the data to Equation 1 yielded a negative turnover value for the monomer (kcat, M), suggesting the monomer is inactive. the data were fit to Equation 2 (see \u201cExperimental Procedures\u201d), which considers only the dimer as the active form of the enzyme. the capacity of MERS-CoV 3CLpro to dimerize is 78\u2013130-fold weaker than the other enzymes. these results indicate that the MERS-CoV 3CLpro dimer is much more weakly associated than the other coronavirus 3CLpro enzymes studied. these results raise questions as to the structural and mechanistic differences among the 3CLpro enzymes that ultimately regulate protease activity during coronavirus replication. values for the inactivation kinetic parameters kinact, t12, and KI were calculated by fitting the progress curve data to Equations 4 and 5. we identified four compounds, 6\u20139, as micromolar inhibitors of MERS-CoV 3CLpro with KI values less than 10 m. the KI values of compounds 6\u20139 for HKU5-CoV 3CLpro are 0.49 0.16, 0.60 0.21, 1.30 0.53, and 0.47 0.06 m. these data suggest that peptidomimetic compounds 6\u20139 have the potential to be developed as coronavirus 3CLpro inhibitors with broad spectrum specificity. best fit value for AUC-SV-calculated Kd is 52 5 m. best fit value for AUC-SV-calculated Kd is 52 5 m. best fit value for koff is 104 s1. UC results show that the monomer peak at 2.9S does not gradually shift peak position toward the dimer peak at 3.9S with increasing concentrations of MERS-CoV 3CLpro. this is indicative of very slow monomer-dimer exchange rate (koff 104 s1) and the formation of hydrodynamically stable monomer and dimer species (55). this koff value is 1000 times slower than the koff value (101 s1) reported for SARS-CoV 3CLpro MERS-CoV 3CLpro was incubated with varying concentrations of compound 6 in stoichiometric ratios of 1:1, 1:2, and 1:4. modified enzyme was subjected to AUC studies to determine the influence of compound 6 on the monomer-dimer equilibrium. enzymatic activity of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 m MERS-CoV 3CLpro was measured in the absence and presence of varying concentrations of compound 10. % activity, normalized to zero inhibitor enzymatic activity, was plotted as a function of increasing inhibitor concentrations. inhibition of enzymatic activity was observed only at higher inhibitor concentrations (40 m or greater) compound 10 binds to a monomer and induces the formation of a dimer. at higher concentrations, compound 10 binds to a monomer and induces the formation of a dimer. monomer to dimer switch leads to the formation of a dimer that contains inhibitor bound in one of the active sites. once the dimer is formed, the substrate binds in the second active site and catalysis takes place. we would also expect to observe induced dimerization and activation in the presence of the substrate. MERS-CoV 3CLpro and 6 complex crystallized as a biologically relevant, symmetrical dimer in space group C2 with one monomer in the asymmetric unit. x-ray data collection, processing, and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 4. x-ray data collection, processing, and refinement statistics. a Mean I/I 5.2 (1.3)a 11.17 (1.83)a Rmerge (%))b 8.3 (67.2)a 8.8 (58.6)a Refinement Resolution range () 19.35\u20131.62 42.59\u20132.10 No. of reflections in working set 30824 76623 No. of reflections in test set 2026 2019 Rwork (%)c 17.8 15.91 Rfree (%)c 21.7 21.51 No. of non-hydrogen atoms Protein/water pound 6 is displayed in ball and stick model with atoms colored as follows: carbons (orange), nitrogens (blue), and oxygens (red). asterisk indicates the electrophilic carbon of compound 6 that forms a C\u2013S covalent bond with the active site cysteine Cys-148. ERS-CoV 3CLpro has a smaller S2 pocket than SARS-CoV 3CLpro. the active site of MERS-CoV 3CLpro bound with compound 6 is shown in Fig. 6, A and B. the active site of MERS-CoV 3CLpro bound with compound 6 is shown in Fig. 6. analysis of the preference for leucine or phenylalanine at the P2 position shows that none of the 11 cleavage sites contain a phenylalanine residue at this position. however, the nsp5nsp6 cleavage site contains a phenylalanine residue at this position. other interactions are also observed to play a significant role in stabilizing the MERS-CoV 3CLpro-compound 6 complex. compound 11 acts as potent noncovalent inhibitors of 3CLpro from SARS-CoV. the x-ray structure of compound 11 bound to 3CLpro was determined to a resolution of 2.1. the x-ray data collection, processing, and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 4. the phenyl ring of phenyl propionamidyl group also form hydrophobic contacts with Leu-49. arginine residues Arg-4 and Arg-298 are substituted in MERS-CoV 3CLpro. mutation of either of these amino acids results in a drastic loss of dimerization in SARS-CoV 3CLpro (36, 38) nonconserved residues between MERS-CoV and other -CoV 2c members may play a significant role in dimer formation. a, superposition of dimers of MERS-CoV 3CLpro (pink color), HKU4-CoV 3CLpro (yellow color, PDB code 2YNB) and SARS-CoV 3CLpro (blue color, PDB code 2ALV) are represented as spheres. pro enzymes from MERS-CoV, HKU5-CoV, HKU4-CoV, and SARS-CoV were used for the sequence alignment and visualization. secondary structural elements of MERS-CoV 3CLpro are represented as spirals for -helix, arrows for -strands, for 310 helix, and T for -turns. nonconserved amino acid His-8 is present at the end of the N-terminal finger. amino acids Thr-128, Lys-155, and Ser-158 are present within 6 of the N-terminal region. nonconserved amino acid Met-61 forms hydrophobic contacts with a residue within the same domain (Ala-114), as well as Glu-290 from domain III. some of the nonconserved residues in MERS-CoV 3CLpro are located in proximity to the substrate-binding site. CLpro (Glu-166) has been established as a key residue linking the substrate-binding site to the dimer interface (56) Glu-290 forms a salt bridge with Arg-4 across the dimer interface in SARS-CoV 3CLpro. however, this interaction is not formed in MERS-CoV 3CLpro due to the substitution of Arg-4 with Val-4. MERS-CoV 3CLpro domains I and II are represented as the rectangular box, and domain III is represented as a cylinder. the yellow cylinder labeled S represents a ligand that can be a peptide inhibitor, peptide substrate, or 3CLpro cleavage sites in the polyprotein. steps required for auto-release of 3CLpro from the polyprotein are described in the text. in step 2, the N termini are cleaved, and the dimer with uncleaved C termini adopts a conformation similar to the mature dimer. in step 2, two dimers with uncleaved C termini approach each other, followed by insertion of the C terminus from one dimer into one of the active sites of the other dimer. conserved amino acid Ser-147 is distant from the dimer interface. mutation results in total loss of dimerization and enzymatic activity of 3CLpro enzymes. ser-147 makes several interactions with other residues involved in forming a hydrogen bonding network. amino acids from the N-terminal finger, the N-terminal helix, and domain III contribute to dimer formation. the most dramatic difference between crystal structures of monomer and the ligand-bound dimer of the R298A mutant was a 33\u00b0 rotation of domain III (38) ligand binding into the active site of the MERS-CoV 3CLpro monomer possibly stabilizes the inter-domain loop conformation that maintains domain III in the correct orientation for dimer formation. ERS-CoV 3CLpro proposes a framework to perform systematic single or multiple mutagenesis studies to gain insights into the mechanism for ligand-induced dimerization of the enzyme. 3CLpro inhibitors with broad spectrum specificity are instrumental for the development of 3CLpro inhibitors with broad spectrum specificity. glu-169 amino acids are conserved in all 3CLpro enzymes. the interactions of the inhibitor with the amino acids His-166 and Glu-169 are conserved. the identification of 3CLpro-inhibitor interactions suggests that the development of broad-spectrum inhibitors of coronavirus 3CLpro is feasible. the presence of an inhibitor could enhance the activity of MERS-CoV 3CLpro to an extent that results in a complete loss of the temporal and spatial regulation of the enzymatic activity. a model for regulation of the enzymatic activity of MERS-CoV 3CLpro during polyprotein processing during virus infection is proposed. a number of in vitro studies performed on SARS-CoV 3CLpro have established the mechanism for 3CLpro auto-release from the polyprotein (34, 39, 40) the steps proposed for auto-release of MERS-CoV 3CLpro from the polyprotein (steps 1\u20134, Fig. 10) have been described in the text. bacterial cells supports steps 1 and 2, where formation of an immature dimer. in step 4, the C termini are cleaved and mature dimer is released from the polyprotein. the dimer formed in step 4 continues to process cleavage sites. ser-147 makes several interactions with other residues involved in forming a hydrogen bonding network. despite being present on an entirely different domain, these residues affect catalysis through a network of residues undergoing correlated motions across the entire protease. a 33\u00b0 rotation of domain III (38) results in a steric clash between domain III from two monomers. however, upon addition of a ligand, domain III of the R298A mutant adopts the correct orientation. ligand binding into the active site of the MERS-CoV 3CLpro monomer may stabilize the inter-domain loop conformation that maintains domain III in the correct orientation for dimer formation. compounds 6\u20139 inhibit all the 3CLpro enzymes tested here. the x-ray structure of MERS-CoV 3CLpro in complex with compound 6 revealed that out of eight direct hydrogen bonds formed between compound 6 and MERS-CoV 3CLpro, four of these hydrogen bonds involve interactions. peptidomimetic compounds containing a Michael acceptor group induce dimer formation of MERS-CoV 3CLpro. but the irreversible nature of their reaction with the active site cysteine ensures complete inhibition of the enzyme at stoichiometric ratios in a time-dependent manner. noncovalent peptidomimetic compounds (for example, compounds 10 and 11) inhibit the enzymatic activity of MERS-CoV 3CLpro only at high compound concentrations ligand-induced dimerization and activation of MERS-CoV 3CLpro is required for the processing of viral polyproteins at 11 distinct cleavage sites. regulation of the enzymatic activity of 3CLpro is instrumental for efficient replication of coronaviruses. SARS-CoV 3CLpro have established the mechanism for 3CLpro auto-release from the polyprotein (34, 39, 40) the steps proposed for auto-release of MERS-CoV 3CLpro from the polyprotein have been adapted from Chen et al. (39), where it is suggested that the N-terminal auto-processing does not require the formation of a mature 3CLpro dimer for SARS-CoV. a substrate S, e.g. one of the 11 polyprotein cleavage sites, would induce dimer formation and thus activate catalysis and cleavage at the substrate recognition sites. the active and mature dimer may dissociate into inactive, mature monomers in the absence of any ligand (step 5). a detailed analysis of nonconserved residues of MERS-CoV 3CLpro among -CoV 2c members identified hot spots, including the active site region, the inter-domain loop, and the domain III. the most dramatic difference between the crystal structures of monomer and the ligand-bound dimer of the R298A mutant of SARS-CoV 3CLpro was a 33\u00b0 rotation of domain III (38) pro monomer stabilizes the inter-domain loop conformation that maintains domain III in the correct orientation for dimer formation. most of the nonconserved residues within domain III are present on the surface and also are distant from the dimer interface. single amino acid mutagenesis alone is unlikely to reveal significant differences in the dimerization properties. four of these hydrogen bonds involve interactions with conserved structural elements of the peptide backbone of the enzyme. the amino acids that form hydrogen bonds with compound 6 through side chain interactions are conserved in all the coronavirus 3CLpro enzymes evaluated here. noncovalent peptidomimetic compounds inhibit the enzymatic activity of MERS-CoV 3CLpro only at high compound concentrations. compounds that irreversibly modify the active site cysteine may serve as better candidates for the development of antiviral agents for MERS-CoV 3CLpro. a number of in vitro studies performed on SARS-CoV 3CLpro have established the mechanism for 3CLpro auto-release from the polyprotein (34, 39, 40) the steps proposed for auto-release of MERS-CoV 3CLpro from the polyprotein (steps 1\u20134, Fig. 10) have been adapted from Chen et al. in step 1, two immature MERS-CoV 3CLpro monomers in the polyprotein approach each other and form an immature dimer via interactions between domain III. in step 2, the N termini are cleaved, and the dimer with uncleaved C termini adopt a conformation similar to the mature dimer. a substrate S, e.g. one of the 11 polyprotein cleavage sites, would induce dimer formation and thus activate catalysis and cleavage at the substrate recognition sites. the inactive but mature monomers require binding of a ligand to undergo ligand-induced dimerization and formation of an active, mature dimer that can then process the polyprotein cleavage sites. amino acids from the N-terminal finger, the N-terminal helix, and domain III contribute to dimer formation. ligand binding into the active site of the MERS-CoV 3CLpro monomer stabilizes the inter-domain loop conformation that maintains domain III in the correct orientation for dimer formation. single amino acid mutagenesis may be limited to only local conformational changes. but local conformational changes may propagate larger effects that stabilize dimer formation upon ligand binding. 3CLpro inhibitors with broad spectrum specificity are instrumental for the development of 3CLpro inhibitors with broad spectrum specificity. x-ray structure reveals two direct hydrogen bonding interactions between the compound and MERS-CoV 3CLpro. one of the hydrogen bonds forms with the side chain -nitrogen of conserved His-166. the second involves the backbone NH of conserved Glu-169. peptidomimetic inhibitors induced dimerization of MERS-CoV 3CLpro. presence of an inhibitor could enhance the activity of MERS-CoV 3CLpro to an extent that results in a complete loss of the temporal and spatial regulation.
