{"summary": "the structure of diarylheptanoids consists of two benzene rings linked by a linear C7-aliphatic chain with varying functional groups on the aryl and aliphatic moieties. the latter group includes meta-meta bridged biphenyls and meta-para diphenyl ethers. compounds 1-5 were assessed for their free radical scavenging activity. also, their anti-inflammatory effect was estimated using carrageenin induced paw edema method. 19 6.60 s 128.9 CH 3-OCH3 3.81 s 61.3 CH3 3.87 s 61.3 CH3 4-OCH3 3.98 s 61.4 CH3 3.99 s 61.4 CH3 17-OH 7.66 brs - 7.70 brs - OH 5.91 brs - 5.90 brs. 1H and 13C NMR data of compounds 3-5 (400 and 100 MHz, DMSO-d6). 41.7 CH2 2.09 m 1.49 m 34.4 CH2 13 3.07 m 2.95 m 28.6 CH2 2.84 m 2.78 m 26.8 CH2 14 - 132.1 C - 130.7 C - 129.4 C 15 7.06 dd (6.6, 1.5) 129.6 CH 6.95 dd (6.6, 1.7) 128.3 CH 6.96 dd (6.6, 1.5) 129.1 CH 16 6.87 d 8.91 brs - - - 2-OH - 5.03 brs - 5.03 d (2.5) - 3-OH - 4.93 d (4.3) - 4.93 d (4.1) - 4-OH - 4.09 d (4.3) - 4.41 d (3.8) - 5-OH - 5.28 d (3.5) - 5.22 d (3.5) - 6-OH - 4.34 t (4.6) - 3.36 t ( pre-coated silica gel 60 F254 TLC plates were used for TLC. Propyl gallate (PG), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), carrageenin, and indomethacin were provided by Sigma-Aldrich Co. (Taufkirchen, Germany) plant material The plant sample was obtained from the Heinrich-Heine Universitys botanical garden (D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany) RP-18 column (2 cm 50 cm 60 g) of sub-fraction F (392 mg, CHCl3:MeOH 90:10 v/v) with meOH:H2O gradient elution followed by HPLC gave 3 (13.7 mg), 4 (15.3 mg), and 5 (18.9 mg) myricanone (1) White needles (22.1 mg); m.p. 191-192 \u00b0C; UV (MeOH) max: 215, 258, 295 nm myricanone 5-O--D-glucopyranoside (4) White amorphous powder (15.3 mg); UV (MeOH) max: 220, 251, 294 nm; NMR data: see Table 2; ESIMS: m/z 519 [M + H]+, 357 [(M + H)-Glu]+. antioxidant activity The antioxidant effect of compounds 1-5 was evaluated by 2,2-diphenylpicrylhydrazyl ( those of 4 except for the appearance of new signals at H 2.08 /C 20.8 (COCH3) and 171.7 (COCH3) characteristic for an acetyl group in 3. Its attachment at C-17 was confirmed by the 3J HMBC cross peak of H-16 to the carbonyl group of acetyl moiety at C 171.7 and further secured by the ESIMS ion peak at 357.2. benzene moieties in 3 (20,21) were established by the COSY cross peaks of H-15 to H-16 and H-18. they were further secured by the HMBC correlations of H-15 to C-17, H-16 to C-1 and C-14, H-18 to C-14 and C-17. the HMBC cross peaks of H-8/C-6, H-19/C-7, and H-18/C-13 were secured. 3 was concluded to be 17-O-acetyl myricanone 5-O--glucopyranoside. alnuheptanoid B (3) was named alnuheptanoid. phenolic compounds are known to inhibit prostaglandins synthesis enzymes. phenolic compounds are known to inhibit prostaglandins synthesis enzymes. 89 Inflamed + 3 10 3.930.12 0.51 4.370.10* 24.13 3.990.13* 38.71 3.740.11* 46.34 3.490.13* 28.48 Inflamed + 4 10 3.940.14 0.25 4.320.15* 25.00 3.910.11* 39.94 3.700.09* 46.92 3.420.15* 29.92 Inflamed + 5 10 3.910.08 1.01 4.070.14"}
