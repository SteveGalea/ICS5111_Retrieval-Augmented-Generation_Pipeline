{"summary": "polymorphisms of interleukin (IL)-12 receptor B1 (IL-12RB1) affect the susceptibility to and outcome of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) no significant difference can be detected in allele or genotype frequencies between patients and controls. interleukin-12 (IL-12) is a cytokine secreted by activated phagocytes and dendritic cells. interferon- production induced by IL-12 forms a major link between innate and adaptive immunity [15]. a recent study revealed that interferon-mediated immunopathological events are associated with atypical innate and adaptive immune responses in SARS patients [16]. cases and controls were selected from two designated hospitals for SARS in Beijing and Tianjin. a total of 132 confirmed SARS patients were reported from these two hospitals. three of the remaining patients died and the other 14 patients were unavailable for study, because of the inconvenience of revisiting. all subjects were confirmed as genetically unrelated through interviewing. the comorbidity conditions that might have effect on disease susceptibility, such as diabetes mellitus, heart disease, hypertension, asthma, tuberculosis, and malignancy. tctgggcctta-3 \u2032 and 92II (Promega, Madison, Wisc., USA) were used at 37\u00b0C. PCR was carried out in PCR buffer (1.5 m M MgCl 2, 10 m M Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 50 m M KCl, 0.1% Triton \u00ae X-100), 100 M of each dNTP, 25 M primers and 1 unit of Taq ten percent of the samples were chosen randomly from each polymorphism for resequencing in order to validate the genotyping method. a total of 132 confirmed SARS patients were reported from two designated hospitals for SARS in Beijing and Tianjin. a total of 132 confirmed SARS patients were reported from these two designated hospitals. 115 confirmed SARS cases were selected for the study. three of the remaining patients died and the other 14 patients were unavailable. the diagnosis was made according to the criteria published by the Chinese Ministry of Public Health. PCR fragment obtained was restricted with Bbv I (New England BioLabs, Beverly, Mass., US) at 37\u00b0C. for +1158T/C typing, 5\u2032-aacaaacgccatctgctacc-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-agagtgagaggccacctgag-3\u2032. PCR was carried out in PCR buffer (1.5 m M MgCl 2, 10 m M Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 50 m M KCl, 0.1% Triton \u00ae X-100), 100 M of each dNTP, 25 M primers and 1 unit of Taq polymerase in a final volume of 30 l. samples were subjected to 30 cycles of PCR amplification with denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 30 s, data were analyzed using the SPSS software (version 10.0, SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA) to correct for multiple testing, we used spectral decomposition (SpD) of matrices of pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) between SNPs, which adjusts for multiple testing while taking into account LD among the tested SNPs [21]. 6.7 71.0 Age (meanSD) 33.111.7 31.67.0 28.411.8 Health care workers (%) 83 (72%) 110 (78%) 0 (0%) Comorbidity (%) 10 (8.7%) 13 (9.2%) 10 (6.5%) Genotype Frequencies of the 4 SNPs of the IL12RB1 gene in SARS Patients and Controls The genotype distribution of +1664 C/T polymorphisms deviate slightly from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium SNPs SARS (n = 115) Control A (n = 141) Control B (n = 155) ORa (95% CI) P valuea ORb (95% CI) P valuea +705A/G A 131 (64.2) 137 (60.6) 186 (61.6) 1 1 G 73 (35.8) 89 (39.3) 116 (38.4) 0.87 (0.89\u20131.09) 0.224 0.91 (0.62\u20131.46) 0.171 +1158T the +1664 C/T genotypes were significantly over represented in patients (41.5% and 8.5%, respectively) compared to the CC genotype, CT and TT genotypes were associated with increased susceptibility to SARS infection with ORs (95% CI) of 2.09 (1.90\u20137.16) and 2.34 (1.79\u201313.37), respectively. 0.020* 1.45 (1.16\u20132.78) 0.047 TT 8(8.5) 6(4.5) 10 (6.7) 2.34 (1.79\u201313.37) * 0.022* 1.47 (0.26\u20132.26) 0.047 TT 8(8.5) 6(4.5) 10 (6.7) 2.34 (1.79\u201313.37) * 0.022* 1.45 (1.16\u20132.78) 0.047 TT 8(8.5) 6(4.5) association with the severity of SARS infection was then estimated by comparing the genotype frequencies and allele frequencies of all the SNPs between the two groups of SARS patients. the final model building disclosed prominent associations between advanced disease with carrying +1664 C/T (CT) and (TT) genotype (P = 0.037) however, this was found not to be significant after Nyholt correction was applied to the analysis.
