{"summary": "at least six different HEV genotypes have been shown to be able to infect humans. most cases in developed countries are caused by zoonotic transmission of genotype 3 HEV through consumption of contaminated pork. eHEV particles are infectious, but they do not have classic envelope proteins thus infect cells via an unusual mechanism. knowledge obtained from studying HEV entry may also aid in the development of antiviral drugs. two types of virions naturally exist during an HEV Infection. the rest of the genome encodes ORF2 and ORF3, both of which are translated from a subgenomic RNA generated during the virus replication cycle. the protein is unique to HEV and plays a role in virion egress [15]. eHEV particles are insensitive to neutralizing anti-capsid antibodies in standard neutralization assays. eHEV is the only form detected in blood [23], suggesting that it mediates HEV spread within the host. eHEV is the only form detected in blood [23], suggesting that it mediates HEV spread within the host. tumor susceptibility gene-1) protein recruits ESCRT-I and \u2013III complexes to promote the budding of the HEV capsid into multivesicular bodies. eHEV membranes contain tetraspannins such as CD63, CD81, and CD9. some host proteins are likely copackaged during eHEV biogenesis. but their identity and roles in the HEV life cycle remain unexplored. the naked, nonenveloped HEV particles are present in the bile and feces of infected patients or experimentally infected monkeys. they are stable in the environment and ideal for transmission to new hosts. despite being highly hepatotropic in vivo, naked HEV is necessary for establishing the first round of infection. HSGPs are glycans present on the cell surface that are involved in cell attachment of many nonenveloped and enveloped viruses. HSGPs are glycans present on the cell surface that are involved in cell attachment and entry of naked HEV. a direct interaction has been shown between the ectodomain of both ASGR1 and ASGR2 and HEV ORF2. both anti-ASGPR antibody and purified ASGPR ectodomain also reduced HEV binding to PLC/PRF/5 cells. ATP5B (ATP Synthase Subunit 5) was identified as a binding partner on the p239 VLP. an independent study using FITC-labeled VLPs and naked HEV particles showed that HEV is internalized by cells in a clathin-, dynamin-dependent pathway [52] the same study has also identified membrane cholesterol, the PI3K pathway, and actin as important factors for HEV internalization and infection. HSGPs are glycans present on the cell surface that are involved in cell attachment of many nonenveloped and enveloped viruses. a number of host factors have been shown to be involved in cell attachment and entry of naked HEV. a number of host factors have been shown to be involved in cell attachment and/or entry of naked HEV. a direct interaction has been shown between the ectodomain of both ASGR1 and ASGR2 and HEV ORF2 by coimmunoprecipitation, pull-down, and ELISA. both anti-ASGPR antibody and purified ASGPR ectodomain also reduced HEV binding to PLC/PRF/5 cells. HSGPs are glycans present on the cell surface that are involved in cell attachment of many nonenveloped and enveloped viruses. treatment of cells with heparinase reduced VLP binding and HEV infection. HSGPs are not essential for cell attachment and infection by eHEV particles. ATP5B (ATP Synthase Subunit 5) is largely a mitochondrial protein. a small fraction is expressed on the cell surface and is implicated in other viral infections. ATP5B was identified as a binding partner on the p239 VLP. the same study has identified membrane cholesterol, the PI3K pathway, and actin as important factors for HEV internalization and infection. the infectivity of naked HEV is not affected by inhibiting Rab5 and Rab7 or by lysosomotropic agents such as bafilomycin and ammonium chloride. eHEV quasienvelope is degraded by lysosomal enzymes prior to uncoating. if this model holds true, it would present a novel entry mechanism for viruses. eHEV membrane has phosphatidylserine, which may bind to its receptor. eHEV particles are transported sequentially into Rab5+ and Rab7+ endosomal compartments and eventually reach the lysosome. treatment of cells with lysosomotropic agents such as bafilomycin A1 and NH4Cl dramatically reduces eHEV infectivity. low pH itself is not sufficient for eHEV cell entry, since extracellular exposure to low pH did not alter the density or infectivity of eHEV. depletion of NPC1 reduced eHEV infection by 50% without significantly affecting HEV infectivity. cells pretreated with a specific inhibitor of lysosomal acid lipase (LAL), an enzyme essential in lipid metabolism because it hydrolyzes cholesteryl esters and triglycerides in lysosomes [60], displayed a dose-dependent reduction in eHEV infectivity. an unexplored question is the role of ORF3 in eHEV entry. the presence of ORF3 may interfere with receptor binding. eHEV membrane has phosphatidylserine, which may bind to its receptor. a better understanding of the tropism and replicative capacity of eHEV in relevant cells/tissues will help differentiate between virus-mediated and immune-mediated effects in these conditions. eHEV enters hepatocytes mainly through the clathrin- and dynamin-dependent pathway [12,52] following the endocytic uptake, eHEV particles are transported sequentially into Rab5+ and Rab7+ endosomal compartments. the presence of a quasienvelope would require the HEV capsid to penetrate two layers of membranes in order to deliver the viral genome into the cytoplasm. however, membrane fusion would result in the intact capsid, rather than the genome, entering the cytoplasm. a second, more likely scenario is by removing the quasienvelope, so that the capsid will be exposed and available for binding to a receptor. virion internalization triggers virion internalization via clathrin-mediated endocytosis. virions are routed through early (Rab5+) and late (Rab7+) compartments. the quasi-envelope becomes slowly degraded by lysosomal enzymes. capsid binds to the same receptor for naked HEV and uncoat via the same mechanism. a viral membrane is a paradigm shift in virology and an exciting area for future investigations. the available evidence suggests that naked and quasienveloped HEV particles use different mechanisms for cell entry."}
