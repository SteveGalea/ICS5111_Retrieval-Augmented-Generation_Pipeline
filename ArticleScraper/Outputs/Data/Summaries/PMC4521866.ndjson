{"summary": "envelope protein (Env) of human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) protrudes out of the viral envelope as homotrimers composed of non-covalently-linked gp120/gp41 heterodimers [2\u20134] recognition of the viral receptor and co-receptor activates the fusion machinery in the transmembrane (TM) gp41 subunit [5\u20138], resulting in the insertion of gp41 N-terminal the MPER sequence is highlighted in bold with its conserved residues shaded. all five tryptophan residues in MPER sequence substituted by Ala. the post-6-HB-formation lipid mixing and subsequent membrane fusion is mediated by the membrane proximal external region in gp41. T20 and T1249, two of the first fusion inhibitors, are synthetic peptides containing sequences from both the HR2 and the N-terminus of MPER [27, 28] the membrane anchoring abilities of the two fusion inhibitors correlate with their antiviral activity. peptides ranging from 19 to 37 amino acids were designed to contain the MPER sequence in its full length, with C-terminal truncation, or with penta TrpAla substitution. peptides ranging from 19 to 37 amino acids (a.a.) were designed to contain the MPER sequence in its full length, with C-terminal truncation. monoclonal mouse anti-actin antibody was obtained from Sigma. the secondary antibodies, HRP-conjugated polyclonal goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulins and HRP-conjugated polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulins, have previously been described. the same mutation was introduced into nSS-gp160 [50], encoding Vpu and a gp160 with a signal peptide of 11 a.a. length. the XmaI-NheI fragment of the constructed mutant was then directionally inserted into pUCEnvxu to create pUCEnvxuss11. pNL1.5EU+W3A was constructed using primer pair B(W664.668.670) pNL1.5EU+W3A was constructed from pNL1.5EU+W3A using primer pair A (W676.678) the mutated pNL1.5EU+ plasmids were sequenced between nucleotide 7988 to 8533 with the sequencing primer. centrifugation and 0.45-m filtration used for virion precipitation. pellets were dissolved in radio-immunoprecipitation assay buffer. cell-free pseudotyped virus of 100TCID50 was pre-incubated with peptides. the IC50 and IC80 values were estimated from the dose-response curves that were curve-fitted with the sigmoidal dose-response non-linear regression model on Prism GraphPad software. the cytotoxicity effect of the peptides on TZM-bl cells were determined by PrestoBlue cell viability assay. the baseline was measured with 10% TFE, with three repeats. the final spectrum was generated by subtracting the averaged sample spectrum with the baseline spectrum. the secondary structures of the peptides were estimated using the CDSSTR deconvolution algorithm on Dichroweb. p24 levels in the cell-free lysate of HLtat cells were quantified by the automated system ARCHITECT (Abbott) a standard curve was generated using p24 of known concentration and curve-fitted with the linear non-regression model. the samples were diluted to the concentrations within the linear range of the standard curve. pNLHIVxuss contains a vpu-deficient HIV-1 genome with the signal sequence of env truncated. the fragment EcoRI-BamHI from pNL4-3 was cloned into pUC18 to create pUC18Envxu that has the Vpu start codon mutated to ATA. the same mutation was introduced into nSS-gp160 [50], encoding Vpu and a gp pNL1.5EU+W5A, pNL1.5EU+W3A and pNL1.5+W2A were constructed from pNL1.5EU+, using Quick Change II (Agilent Technologies) pNL1.5EU+W3A was constructed using the primer pair B(W664.668.670) s were sequenced between nucleotide 7988 to 8533 with the sequencing primer (7988F-CTCCTGGGGATTTGGGGTTG and 8533R-GTCTCTCTCAAGCGGTGGTAGC) pseudotyped HIV-1 production and precipitation of virus particles HLtat cells (5 X 105) were co-transfected with the HIV-1 proviral clone pNLHIVxuss, and with the Env- pseudotyped HIV-1 virus of 100TCID50 was pre-incubated with peptides of various concentrations at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. TZM-bl cells contain integrated copies of an LTR (long terminal repeats)-driven luciferase reporter gene. TCID50 of pseudotyped HIV-1 was assessed as luciferase activity. final spectrum was obtained by normalizing the 570 nm values to the 600 nm values. peptides were dissolved in 10%, 20%, or 40% TFE. the membranes were either exposed to film or analyzed with G:BOX Chemi XX6 (Syngene) the band intensities were quantified by the automated system ARCHITECT (Abbott) a standard curve was generated using p24 of known concentration and curve-fitted with the linear non-regression model. seudovirus particles were produced by the co-transfection of the proviral vector pNLHIVuss and the expressing vector pNL1.5EU+ [48] the pseudotyped HIV-1 (NL4-3) particles were pre-incubated with each of the six MPER-containing peptides for 1 h and then added to the target cells, TZM-bl cells. the inhibition of infection was monitored by measuring the luciferase expression at 72 h tat-activated luciferase activity in TZM-bl cells was assessed as a measurement of viral entry and infection. no cytotoxicity effect was observed for the MPER-derived peptides at 50 M in TZM-bl cells. peptides were dissolved in H2O supplemented with 10%, 20% or 40% TFE. circular dichroism spectra and the estimated secondary structure contents of peptide LK21-5W5A in increasing concentrations of TFE measured as described in C. the spike (S) protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has previously been shown to be largely -helical and a synthetic peptide (HR2-S) derived from this region served as a control peptide in the following CD study [56]. terminally dimerized peptides mimic the fusion-active oligomerization state of gp41 MPER. monomeric peptides were constructed with parallel peptide chains with either carboxylic termini or two amino termini using chemoselective ligation strategy. monomeric peptides were synthesized with an additional N-terminal Cys residue. the EK37-DN and EK30-DN have IC50 values of 1.2 M and 1.1 M, an increase of the potency by 5.2- and 1.9-fold compared to the monomeric EK30 and EK37 respectively. however, the C-terminal dimerization decreased the potency of EK37 and QK26, with IC50 values of EK37-DC elevated by 1.7 and 1.3 fold. no cytotoxicity effect was observed for the MPER-derived dimeric peptides at 100 M in TZM-bl cells. monomeric and dimeric peptides (100 M) were incubated with 10,000 Vero cells for 24 h. Env- and Vpu-expression-deficient proviral vector pNLHIVxuss produced pseudo-typed HIV-1 (NL4-3) viral particles containing WT, W5A, W3A or W2A Env. the expressed pseudo-HIV-1 particles were termed HIV(WT), HIV(W5A), HIV(W3A) or HIV(W2A) at 48 h post-transfection, it was found that the levels in cell lysates HLtat cells from A were harvested 48 h post-transfection. lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies against gp41, p24, Vif, Nef and -actin. cell culture supernatant from A containing HIV(WT), HIV(W5A), HIV(W3A) or HIV(W2A) was clarified through centrifugation and 0.45m filtration. luciferase activity in TZM-bl cells was standardized to 100%. the other two mutants, HIV(W5A) and HIV(W2A, showed no increased intracellular p24 levels. the analysis was performed using the automated system ARCHIECT (Abbot) accreditated for detection of p24 in human serum. p24 levels were detected in the HIV(W5A) (p = 0.0378, n = 7) expressing cultures. compared to that in HIV(WT), there was moderate decrease in Env level among the mutant viral particles. p55/Gag and p24 contents were elevated by approximately 200% and 310% respectively. mutations significantly influenced intracellular expression levels of p55/Gag. the substitutions of the Trp to Ala rendered the viral particles non-infectious. in addition of five HR2 residues to LK21 N-terminus, generating the 26-a.a. peptide QK26, decreased the IC50 and IC80 values to 3.9 M and 8.8 M, respectively. however, adding the HR2 hydrophilic residues greatly enhanced the solubility and structural stability of the MPER-containing peptides QK26, EK30 and EK37. Fifty M of the peptides were incubated with 10,000 Vero cells for 24 h. cytotoxicity effects were monitored as absorbance values (OD) LK21-5W5A increased the viral infectivity by 50% at 26.6 M. inhibitions of viral infectivity by the MPER-derived peptides were not due to cytotoxicity. LK21-5W5A, the peptide with all the Trp replaced by Ala, exhibited canonical alpha-helical spectra and a high -helical content (84%) starting from 20% TFE. we hypothesized that N-terminally dimerized peptides would mimic the fusion-active oligomerization state of gp41 MPER. N-terminal dimerization employed linker molecule consisting of two serine residues branching from a lysine. two peptides were attached at their N-termini via a thiazolidine linkage. N-terminal dimers were synthesized from the peptide EK30 and EK37. no cytotoxicity effect was observed for the MPER-derived dimeric peptides at 100 M in TZM-bl cells. monomeric and dimeric peptides were incubated with 10,000 Vero cells for 24 h. site-directed mutagenesis was performed on plasmid pNL1.5EU+ [48] and generated three gp160 mutants. all five Trp, the three N-terminal Trp (W664, W668 and W670) or the two C-terminal Trp (W670 and W670) in the MPER sequence were substituted with Ala. the resulting constructs were termed W5A, W3A, and W2A. p = 0.038 for W5A, p = 0.020 for W3A, p = 0.026 for W2A, n = 5) expression and viral incorporation of viral structural proteins in pseudovirus-producing HLtat cells. p24 levels in cell lysates were quantified by the automated system Architect. p24 levels in the culture supernatant of HLtat cells in A was quantified by the automated system Architect. gp41, p55/Gag and p24 levels in precipitated HIV(WT), HIV(W5A), HIV(W3A) and HIV(W2A) the two viral cytosolic precursor structural proteins meet up with Env at the plasma membrane. p55/Gag interacts with cytosolic tail of Env to recruit it into the assembling viral particles. the viral protease within p55/Gag is activated leading to processing of Gag-Pol and p55/Gag. proteins, Vif and Nef were blotted and served as control for transfection efficiency. intracellular elevation of p24 by 93% was a result of increased expression of p55/Gag. extracellular p24 levels in the HIV(W3A)-expressing cultures were 67% higher than those of the HIV(WT) the influence of the Trp substitutions to Ala in the MPER on viral entry and infectivity was also tested. gp41 MPER induces membrane-fusion-required membrane perturbation in the viral envelope and cellular membranes, through its two conserved membrane-active sequence elements. peptide LK21, containing the entire MPER sequence, inhibited pseudotyped HIV-1(NL4-3) entry and infection with the IC50 values at 8.0 M. further N-terminal extension of LK21 did not enhance its anti-viral effect substantially, probably because this sequence does not include enough residues to mediate a stable interaction between the peptide and the viral HR1. the MPER C-termini of the neighboring gp41 stay monomeric and assume an extended platform to destabilize the cholesterol-enriched lipid bilayers. deletion of the C-terminal sequence including the conserved CRAC motif in the MPER-containing peptide QK26 abrogated its anti-viral effect. peptide dimerization data further support that the inclusion of free C-termini for membrane interaction in the MPER peptides are important for their inhibition of HIV-1 LK21-W5A peptide promoted viral infectivity rather than inhibiting it, a phenotype that has been observed when Ala-substituting the Trp residues of the SARS-CoV MPER peptide [67]. the data indicate the significance of membrane-active elements in MPER-containing peptides, both the CRAC motif and Trp residues, for the inhibition of HIV-1 entry. in gp41, Trp670 has previously been shown to mediate the MPER-FP interaction. it could lead to a diminished affinity between the peptide and the FP in gp41. this could also contribute to the loss of the anti-viral effect of the peptide. the HIV-1 MPER contains neighboring epitopes for broadly neutralizing antibodies. a tetramer peptide mimetic has elicited broadly neutralizing antibodies 4E10 and 2F5 in guinea pigs. this rises the potential immunogenicity problem with the MPER-derived anti-viral peptides. the peptides should be tested with different subtypes of HIV-1 to confirm the antiviral activity. the substitution of all five Trp to Ala in the MPER antiviral peptide resulted in it predominantly adopting a helical structure. this suggests that the Trp residues could be equally vital for the secondary structure of the MPER region within gp160. p55/Gag expression inhibits the steady-state intracellular level of p55/Gag. p55/Gag expression could be executed at both protein level through the Env cytoplasmic tail, or at RNA level through actions via the Rev response element within the env gene. the role of gp41 MPER Trp residues in modulating the viral contents of Gag proteins might guide the discovery of potential therapeutic targets against HIV-1 infection. 293T cells were transiently transfected to express wild type spike protein (Swt) different sizes of 180 kDa (mature) and 170 kDa (immature) due to different glycosylation and maturation stages. the majority of Swt gp180 was directed to lipid-raft containing fractions. the majority of Swt gp170 was retained in the bottom fractions. pNL4-3Luc+Env-Vpr- was provided by Prof. Zhang Linqi. peptides were incubated with the virus for 1 h under 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C."}
