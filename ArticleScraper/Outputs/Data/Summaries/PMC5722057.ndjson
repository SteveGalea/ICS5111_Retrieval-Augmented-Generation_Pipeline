{"summary": "genome sequence of divergent human rhinovirus species C isolate recovered in march 2015 from tracheal aspirate of a 15-month-old infant with a severe community-acquired lower respiratory tract infection. the previously healthy infant developed progressively worsening cough and congestion that advanced to acute respiratory failure and septic shock. 58,922 unique reads aligning to human rhinovirus species were identified. the p contiguous sequence was found to be most phylogenetically related to human rhinovirus C isolate LZ269 (GenBank accession number JF317013). this isolate is 23% divergent in VP1 and 21% divergent when compared across the entire genome (8)."}
