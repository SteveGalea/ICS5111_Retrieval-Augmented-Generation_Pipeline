{"summary": "male (n = 12) and female (n = 12) Sprague\u2013Dawley rats were group-housed in autoclaved polycarbonate ventilated microisolation cages. male (n = 12) and female (n = 12) hairless mice were group-housed in autoclaved polycarbonate ventilated microisolation cages. mice were antibody-negative for ectromelia virus, epizootic diarrhea of infant mice virus, rotavirus, Hantaan virus, K virus, lactate dehydrogenase elevating virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. both rats and mice were free of external and internal parasites. limation or training sessions occurred daily for rats (5 sessions) and 3 times a week for mice (7 sessions). rat operant chamber consisted of an acrylic box (20.3 cm 20.3 cm 16.2 cm with an opening (4 6 cm) in one wall and placed within the rat box. rats were anesthetized by placing them in an induction box and delivering isoflurane (5%) and oxygen via precision vaporizer. anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane (2% to 2.5%) and oxygen mixture delivered via nose cone. a bland ophthalmic ointment was placed liberally on both eyes to prevent corneal dryness. doses were tested in the following order: baseline (no injection), 0.05 mg/kg, 0.1 mg/kg, saline, 0.01 mg/kg, and 0.03 mg/kg. all injections were given 20 min prior to the induction of thermal sensitivity (capsaicin application) or incisional pain (rats only) animals were anesthetized as described earlier. rats were divided in 2 groups (6 rats per group) on test day. a surgical incision was used to induce pain instead of capsaicin. the skin on the side of the face was cleaned with 3 preparations of 4% chlorhexidine scrub followed by warm saline rinse. one-way ANOVA with a posthoc Bonferroni multiple-comparison test was used to compare responses between capsaicin and incision with and without buprenorphine. both rats and mice were housed in a temperature-controlled room on a 12:12-h light cycle (lights on, 0600) the rats were antibody-negative for coronavirus (sialodacryoadenitis virus), Kilham rat virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, mouse adenovirus, Mycoplasma pulmonis, pneumonia virus of mice, rat minute virus, rat parvovirus, reovirus type 3, sendai virus, and Toolan H1 virus. both rats and mice were free of external and internal parasites in rats, daily 6-h fasting occurred every morning during weekday acclimation and training sessions but never occurred on consecutive days once the experiment started. acclimation and training sessions were alternated throughout the experimental timeline. rats were anesthetized by placing them in an induction box and delivering isoflurane (5%) and oxygen via precision vaporizer until the righting reflex was abolished. animals were removed from the box and placed on a warm water-circulating blanket to maintain body temperature. animals were weighed, and the selected dose of buprenorphine for the day was calculated. all animals received all test doses in a crossover design. animals were allowed to recover from anesthesia for 30 min (rats) or 60 min (mice) a training session (no capsaicin, thermode temperature at 37 \u00b0C) was provided after each test session to create a wash-out period of at least 4 d. the incisional pain test session (rats only) followed an adequate wash-out period after all capsaicin tests were finished. licks to facial contact event ratio was calculated by dividing the total number of licking events by the total number of facial contact events lasting more than 0.1 s. each session lasted 20 min in both rats and mice. lick:face ratio during training was 30.6 4.1. there was a significant (P = 0.0166) dose effect between groups. the Dunn multiple-comparison test showed a significant difference between saline and buprenorphine at 0.05 mg/kg. the mean change in the lick:face ratio was 1%, 58%, 18%, and \u20131.3% for 0.01, 0.05, 0.10, and 0.2 mg/kg buprenorphine. results of the dose\u2013response study for male rats included a statistically significant main effect (H4=35.34, P 0.0001) for the independent variable of dose on lick:face ratio. the lick:face ratio was 6.5 0.9, 6.9 1.5, 10.8 1.2, 17.0 3.6, and 12.9 2.4 for buprenorphine doses of 0, 0.005 0.01, 0.03, and 0.05 mg/kg. the lick:face ratio during training was not recorded for female rats. the lick:face ratio did not differ between capsaicin-induced heat and incision-induced heat hyperalgesia models in male rats. however, the lick:face ratio differed significantly (*, P 0.05) in when the nontraumatic (capsaicin) insult was compared with the traumatic (incision) insult after treatment with buprenorphine at 0.01 mg/kg. animals control the amount of nociceptive stimulus received, thus eliminating the need to establish a predetermined cut-off threshold to avoid physical trauma. animals are unrestrained and control the amount of nociceptive stimulus received, thus essentially eliminating the need to establish a predetermined cut-off threshold to avoid physical trauma. using capsaicin allows us to lower the thermode testing temperature. limiting contact time to 5 min, thus potentially minimizing the perception of pain without noxious thermal contact. this difference can be attributed to complex central and peripheral pain mechanisms that are activated during physical trauma. peripheral nociceptors are exposed to chemical agents released from injured cells. in male rats, the optimal dose range for buprenorphine at 50 min after administration was 0.03 to 0.05 mg/kg. but the optimal buprenorphine dose at 50 min after administration was limited to 0.03 mg/kg for female rats. the maximum analgesic efficacy of buprenorphine was achieved at 0.05 mg/kg in female mice and at 0.03 mg/kg in female rats. the higher end of the reported analgesic dose range in the females of the stocks we tested did not provide an increased analgesic advantage. the results observed at 0.2 mg/kg in mice were the most surprising, because the lick:face ratio obtained when this dose was delivered was no different than that observed when mice were treated with norphine are greatly diminished, if not absent, at doses exceeding 0.1 mg/kg in male and female mice. additional studies are needed to further evaluate the observed decrease in the lick:face ratio of mice. lick:face ratio from training sessions for both mice and rats could not be used for follow-up statistical analyses. current study did not evaluate dose efficacy over time, but whether analgesic efficacy would improve for the doses considered suboptimal at the time point tested is unknown. en and meloxicam in rats at doses of 5 to 10 mg/kg and 1 to 10 mg/kg, respectively, was inconclusive. the current assay may need to be modified to test the effectiveness of the peripheral analgesic effects of NSAID. however, the data shown account only for optimal doses at a specific time point."}
