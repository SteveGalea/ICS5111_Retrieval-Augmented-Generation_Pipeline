{"summary": "a prospective, unblinded study was carried out in six healthy volunteers at the Prince of Wales Hospital in Shatin, Hong Kong. the study compared the filtration capacity of the Stryker T4 and Stackhouse FreedomAire surgical helmets with an 8233 N100 filtering facepiece respirator. each participant performed one test with each device. the reusable tubing supplied by the manufacturer was replaced with disposable polyvinyl chloride tubing of the same internal diameter and length. the 8026 Particle Generator (TSI Incorported) was used to generate saline particles throughout the testing procedures. the highest fan speed was used throughout the testing. a half-face respirator, such as the N100 mask, should reduce the particle count by a minimum of a factor of 100 (11) the greatest particle count reduction achieved with a surgical helmet-hood was a factor of 4.8. the surgical helmet-hoods are not approved as a respirator nor marketed as a method of protecting the user against respiratory pathogens. the surgical helmet-hoods are both PVC, and of the same internal diameter and length. however, this change is unlikely to have made a difference in the results. the particle count inside the helmet was low, regardless of whether the fan was turned on or off. it seems unlikely that the particles are coming from any of these sources. the exact mechanism of entry would be irrelevant."}
