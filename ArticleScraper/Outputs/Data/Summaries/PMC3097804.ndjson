{"summary": "a new global outbreak of a novel Influenza A virus, a swine virus with confirmed human infection, occurred in 2009. it is unrelated to any swine influenza virus previously identified in north America. there is sustained human-to-human transmission in this new subtype of Influenza A virus. 48 patients including pregnant women were deemed not necessary to have any form of imaging. the chest radiographic images obtained from the 118 patients were reviewed by two staff radiologists. serial radiographs of patients with progressive clinical signs were also reviewed to assess disease progression and response to treatment. in the majority of patients (43/49), there was radiological improvement in the follow-up chest radiographs. five patients had progressive alveolar consolidation ranging from 2 to 13 days with one developing acute respiratory distress syndrome. three were HRCT and the common findings were widespread interstitial shadowing, ground-glass change and atelectasis. the first death occurred on July 24, 2009, where a 30-year-old student who returned from a holiday break in Medan had progressive fever and cough and eventually died. as of October 17, 2009, there had been 77 H1N1-related deaths in Malaysia. the findings were similar to the authors\u2019 series but did not find any evidence of pulmonary embolism in their sample population. imaging will play an important role in detecting lung changes and to monitor disease progression."}
