{"summary": "SL-CoVs are a zoonotic pathogen that caused the 2002-2003 SARS pandemic. most bat SL-CoVs have been identified only by sequences. their potential for transmission to and likely pathogenesis in domestic animals and humans remains untested. coronaviruses carry a set of open reading frames (ORFs) expressed from full-length mRNAs and subgenomic-length mRNAs (sgRNAs) which have a common 3\u2032 end originating at distinct transcription regulatory sequences (TRS) and joined with a common leader sequence encoded at the 5\u2032 end of genomic RNA (14). Currently, coronaviruses are divided into the genera Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, 16 of the closest relatives to human SARS-CoV discovered so far have an extra ORF (named ORFX) between ORF6 and ORF7 with no homology to any known protein sequences (2, 10) eukaryotic overexpression assays and recombinant viruses generated through reverse genetics techniques. reporter plasmids used included pIFN-Luc, pNF-B-Luc and pRL-TK. plasmids included pIFN-Luc, pNF-B-Luc and pRL-TK. the virus genome was divided into 8 continuous fragments (A to G) and amplified using specific primers. the amplicons were cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega) c1575a, c1575a, and RA were used for overlap extension PCR. the synonymous mutation T27527C was introduced to interrupt a potential T7 termination site via OE-PCR. the cytomegalovirus promoter was amplified from pcDNA3.1(+) subclone A and subclone G were digested with SacII and AscI. pBAC-CMV was digested with SacII and AscI. all digestion products were then separated using 1% agarose gels. unique BglI sites were introduced into the fragments by synonymous mutations to make them capable of unidirectional ligation along with native BglI sites in the genome. the original nucleotides are shown above the flanking sequences of corresponding fragments. a poly(A) sequence was added to the 3\u2032 terminus of fragment G. RNAs extracted from wild-type and recombinant viruses were reverse transcribed with random hexamer primers. RNAs extracted from wild-type and recombinant viruses were reverse transcribed with random hexamer primers. RT-PCR was used to generate five amplicons containing the five mutations designed in the strategy. a 1,437-bp amplicon spanning the D/E junction (nucleotide positions 16793 to 18229) and a 1,438-bp amplicon spanning the E/F junction (nucleotide positions 21908 to 23345) the first amplicon of wild-type WIV1 (wtWIV1) that contains nucleotide 1571 can be cleaved by BglI, but the other four the RNA was hydrolyzed with 0.05 M NaOH for 40 min. the membrane was prehybridized, probed with a digoxigenin probe. detection was performed according to the instructions for the DIG-High Prime DNA labeling and detection starter kit II. 293T cells were seeded in 12-well plates and cotransfected with empty vector plasmid pCAGGS, plasmid pCAGGS-NS1 or increasing amounts (100, 200, 400, 600, and 800 ng) of pCAGGS-ORFX with indicated reporter plasmids. at 24 h posttransfection, cells were infected with Sendai virus (100 hemagglutinin units [HAU]/m 293T cells were transfected with empty vector, NS1 or ORFX-expressing plasmid. after 24 h, IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) nuclear translocation was induced. the cells were fixed and stained with a rabbit anti-IRF3 polyclonal IgG and a mouse anti-HA IgG (Promoter) the mRNA expression levels of IFN-, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF- were quantified by quantitative PCRs. the expression of GAPDH mRNA was measured as an internal control. cells were grown at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. the amplified gene was cloned into plasmid pCAGGS with a C-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tag. hACE2 cells were infected with viruses at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1.0, 0.1, or 0.001 in 25-cm2 flasks with a 1-h adsorption period. the viral supernatants were harvested at 0, 2, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 72 h postinoculation. the virus concentration was titrated by plaque assay in vero E6 cells. several natural BglI sites were introduced by synonymous mutations in the PCR process to make all contiguous cDNA fragments capable of unidirectional ligation. a poly(A) sequence (25 nt) was added to the 3\u2032 terminus of fragment G. at least three colonies of each cDNA clone were sequenced. the three PCR products were ligated using OE-PCR. the amplicon was then inserted into pBeloBAC11 (New England BioLabs) between BamHI and HindIII sites. the construct was designated pBAC-CMV. the mutations are indicated under the stars. C1575A was used to ablate a natural BglI site at nucleotide 1571. the rescued mutant was named rWIV1-GFP-X. rWIV1-GFP-X was amplified with primers FF and RFoeGFP. the two products were then cloned into pGEM-T Easy. RT-PCR was used to generate five amplicons containing the five mutations designed in the strategy. these amplicons included a 1,124-bp amplicon (nucleotide positions 1312 to 2435) spanning a naturally occurring BglI site at nucleotide 1571. the five amplicons of recombinant viruses are different from those of wild-type virus in the capability of being cut by BglI. intracellular RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Ambion) at 24 h postinfection, RNA (20 g) was precipitated, treated with 17 l sample buffer (50% formamide, 2.2 M formaldehyde [37%], 1 morpholinepropanesulfonic acid [MOPS] at 65\u00b0C for 10 min. RNA was hydrolyzed with 0.05 M NaOH for 40 min, transferred to a Hybond-N+ membrane ( FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Promoter) was used for secondary detection in cells expressing the Golgi marker. nuclei were stained with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) 293T cells were transfected with empty vector, NS1 or ORFX-expressing plasmid. after 24 h, the cells were infected with SeV (100 HAU/ml) at 12 h postinfection, the cells were lysed. the expression level of IFN- mRNA was determined by quantitative PCR. an Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG and a Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (Promoter) were used to detect IRF3 and SeV. mRNA expression levels of IFN-, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF- were quantified by quantitative PCRs. plasmid pBAC-CMV was constructed by inserting the cytomegalovirus promoter, hepatitis delta virus (hepatitis delta virus) ribozyme and bovine growth hormone (BGH) transcription terminal signal sequences into pBeloBAC11. the two fragments, along with fragments B to F, were digested using BglI. the constructed clone (pBAC-CMV-rWIV1) was transfected into vero E6 cells. a cytopathic effect was observed at 72 h posttransfection. vero E6 cells were infected with wtWIV1 (), rWIV1 () or rWIV1-X () at an MOI of 1.0 or 0.1 PFU/cell. cell supernatants were taken at the indicated time points postinfection. recombinant virus was rescued by plaque assay in vero E6 cells. rWIV1-X and rWIV1 replicated to titers close to those of wild-type virus. expected set of appropriately sized 10 sgRNAs, including sgRNA7 (ORFX), were observed in northern blot analysis in cells infected with wtWIV1 and rWIV1. 293T cells seeded in 12-well plates were transfected with 100 ng pIFN-Luc, 5 ng pRL-TK, empty vector. ORFX protein inhibits production of type I interferon. similar results were observed for IFN- mRNA quantification. the cells were infected with Sendai virus at 24 h posttransfection. the results were expressed as the firefly luciferase value normalized to that of Renilla luciferase. the cells were fixed at 8 h postinfection and stained with anti-HA IgG. each group was expressed as the percentage of their relative IRF3 translocation ratios to that of the control (cells transfected with empty vector) at 4, 12, 24, and 30 h postinfection, cell RNA was extracted and used for quantitative RT-PCR of the expression level of IFN- mRNA. the IRF3 nuclear translocation efficiency of each group was expressed as the percentage of their relative IRF3 translocation ratios to that of the control. NS1 strongly inhibited translocation of IRF3, while ORFX protein also showed inhibition of IRF3 translocation but less efficiently. the rWIV1-X titers did not show an obvious decrease compared to those of wild-type virus. we expected the ORFX deletion mutant would replicate less efficiently than the wild-type virus in IFN-competent cells. however, we did not find a significant difference when we grew the two viruses in Calu-3 and HeLa-hACE2 cells. ORFX protein obviously activated NF-B, no matter whether the cells were treated with TNF- or not. IL-8 was upregulated only when the cells were treated with TNF-. no significant difference was observed for IL-6 and IL-8 transcription levels. the plasmid pBAC-CMV was constructed by inserting the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter, hepatitis delta virus (hepatitis delta virus) ribozyme, and bovine growth hormone (BGH) transcription terminal signal sequences into pBeloBAC11. the eight genomic fragments were inserted into pBAC-CMV in one step. to rescue recombinant viruses, fragments A and G were digested with SacII and AscI. the two fragments, along with fragments B to F, were digested using BglI. the constructed clone (pBAC-CMV-rWIV1) was transfected into vero E6 cells. vero E6 cells were infected with wild-type or recombinant viruses. intracellular RNA was extracted for Northern blotting analysis. a FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was used for secondary detection. ORFX protein showed a cytoplasmic distribution and colocalized with the ER maker SecG1. rWIV1-X and rWIV1 replicated to titers close to those of wild-type virus. sgRNA7 (ORFX) was not observed in rWIV1-X infected cells.

NS1 strongly inhibited translocation of IRF3, while ORFX protein also showed inhibition of IRF3 translocation but less efficiently. the replication of rWIV1-X was inhibited and reduced by 0.5 log compared to that of wtWIV1 and rWIV1 at concentrations of 10 and 100 U/ml IFN-. at a higher IFN- concentration, the rWIV1-X titers did not show an obvious decrease compared to those of wild-type virus. 293T cells were transfected with 100 ng pNF-B-Luc, pRL-TK, empty vector, NS1-expressing plasmid. after 24 h, the cells were mock treated or treated with TNF-. no significant difference was observed for IL-6 and IL-8 transcription levels. the RNA extracted from Calu-3 cells for Fig. 4 was used for quantification of expression of IL-6 (C), IL-8 (D) and TNF- (E) mRNAs. the method allows the genomes of coronaviruses to be split into multiple fragments and inserted into a BAC plasmid with a single step. the translation of a novel 11-kDa accessory protein of WIV1 brings the total number of group-specific accessory proteins to ten. previous studies showed that SARS-CoV group-specific accessory genes ORF3b and ORF6 inhibit host IFN production. the effect decreased when more ORFX protein was expressed. Coronavirus was previously shown to induce the unfolded-protein response (UPR) and ER stress in infected cell culture (32). Normally, ER is an active organelle for protein folding and modification. loss of protein folding homeostasis would cause ER stress and induce the UPR. in this process, NF-B is activated, and apoptosis will be induced if ER stress is prolonged (32, 33). research in the future."}
