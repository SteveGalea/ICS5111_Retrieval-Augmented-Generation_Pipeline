{"summary": "in the years to come, the development of small-size instruments for on-the-spot pathogen detection is expected to be an important segment of the POCT market. a few companies have launched self-test products for hepatitis and human immunodeficiency virus detection based on antibody\u2013antigen interactions. a promising alternative would be the inherently simple and lost-cost electrochemical method. in 2004, Liu et al. (7) successfully demonstrated a fully integrated biochip for cell isolation and lysis, target amplification, as well as electrochemical amplicon detection. however, the design and fabrication of the chip involves many complicated steps. a single silicon\u2013glass microchamber was used for multiple pathogen detection. a model system of E.coli and B.subtilis was used. the assay involves the following steps: sample preparation. silicon chip (thickness of 400 m) had two fluid injection holes (top side, diameter of 500 m, depth of 100 m) and a chamber (bottom side, length and width of 5 mm, depth of 325 m) etched by inductively coupled plasma/deep reactive ion etching (ICP/DRIE) process. thin-film platinum (100 nm) was patterned on top of silicon substrate as heater and temperature sensors. a mixture of 60 mM pyrrole, 20 M pyrrole-EC, and 0.1 M LiClO4 was introduced into the microchamber. the microchamber was then washed with deionized water and dried with nitrogen gas. oligonucleotide capture probe specific for B.subtilis amplicon was used. PCR master mix consisted of 1 buffer (20 mM TrisHCl, pH 8.4, 50 mM KCl), 2 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 200 nM of biotinylated E.coli forward primer (5\u2032-biotin-GACAAGAAAATCTCCAACATCC-3\u2032), 2 nM of E.coli reverse primer (5\u2032-ACAACACGTTTAGCC-3\u2032), 2 nM 200 nM of B.subtilis biotinylated reverse primer (5\u2032-biotin-CCAGTTTCCAATGACCCTCCCC-3\u2032), 0.5 g/L BSA, and 0.4 U/L Taq polymerase. solution was allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 h. s and instrumentation Oligonucleotides and PCR reagents were obtained from Invitrogen. electrochemical measurements were performed using a VMP multichannel potentiostat. the thermal control system consisted of a data acquisition card (PCI-MIO-16E-1, National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA) UV-69, Summers Optical, Hatfield, PA, USA, used to bond silicon and glass chips. pipet tips were glued to the fluid injection holes with epoxy. magnetic particles were washed with an equal volume of saline/sodium citrate buffer. the supernatant was removed and the magnetic particles were incubated with 10 L of 10 nM biotinylated genome capture probe overnight at room temperature. the temperature was cooled to 50\u00b0C and held for 10 min to allow specific hybridization between the denatured genomic DNAs and capture probes. asymmetric PCR consisted of 1 buffer (20 mM TrisHCl, pH 8.4, 50 mM KCl), 2 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 200 nM of biotinylated E.coli forward primer (5\u2032-biotin-GACAAGAAAATCTC the stock was diluted 10 times with 0.05 M 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid/0.2 M NaCl for 30 min at room temperature. silver deposition was then achieved by applying a potential of 0.18 V in a silver nitrate solution (1 mM AgNO3/1 M KNO3) for 20 s. asymmetric PCR The PCR master mix consisted of 1 buffer (20 mM TrisHCl, pH 8.4, 50 mM KCl), 2 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 200 nM of biotinylated E.coli forward primer (5\u2032-biotin-GACAAGAAAATCTCCAACATCC-3\u2032), 2 nM of B.subtilis reverse primer (5\u2032-CCTACGGGA the unbound gold nanoparticles were removed by flushing the microchamber with phosphate-buffered nitrate solution. electrocatalytic silver deposition onto the hybrid-bound gold nanoparticles was then achieved by applying a potential of 0.18 V in a silver nitrate solution (1 mM AgNO3/1 M KNO3) for 20 s. a solution of pyrrole and oligonucleotide 1 bearing a pyrrole group is introduced into the microchamber. the microchamber is washed with water to ensure there is no pyrroleoligonucleotide monomer is left. this procedure is repeated for the other electrodes with different pyrroleoligonucleotide polymerization solutions. electrode-by-electrode capture probe immobilization via electrochemical copolymerization of pyrrole and pyrroleoligonucleotide. the polymerization solution contained 60 mM pyrrole, 20 M pyrroleprobe, and 0.1 M LiClO4. the electrode was subjected to a cyclic voltammetric scan between 0.5 and +0.65 V. asymmetric PCR is conducted to generate single-stranded rich target amplicons. amplicons are labeled with gold nanoparticles via biotin\u2013avidin interaction. silver metal is electrocatalytically deposited onto gold nanoparticles. the silver stripping time to reach a potential of +0.65 V was taken as the sample signal. the number of cells stated was the amount being introduced into the microchamber. the results for the detection of the two model species are presented in Figure 6. oligonucleotide detection capture probes are immobilized in duplicate. it is recommended that each individual electrode in an electrode array has a specific capture probe. the more common chemical attachment (spotting) method cannot be used because all the active electrode surfaces are embedded within the same microchamber. electrodes B and C exhibit much higher fluorescence intensity than electrodes A and D, indicating the highly specific probe immobilization as well as hybridization offered by the electrochemical pyrrole-based attachment chemistry. the linkage between the immobilized capture probe and electrode surface must be strong enough to survive through the thermal cycling process. amplification, and product detection performed within the same microchamber. intact cells are first broken down by applying a high temperature (90\u00b0C) to free the genomic DNA. magnetic particles are used to isolate the specific genomes. the ability of this single microchamber to detect specific cell type is demonstrated by running a series of experiments with E.coli cells of different concentrations. Figure 5 gives a semi-log plot of the sample to background ratio against the number of cells in the sample. this result confirms the successful isolation of the genome with the magnetic particle-based approach. 103 cells for each species per sample were used in this microdevice platform. thermal cell lysis, magnetic particle-based target genome isolation, DNA amplification and electrochemical sequence-specific amplicons detection have been successfully implemented."}
