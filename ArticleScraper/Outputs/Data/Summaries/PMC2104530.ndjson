{"summary": "anthrax, caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis, has been used as both a biological warfare agent and bioterrorist weapon previously. antibiotic therapy is effective in the early stages of anthrax infection but does not have any effect once exposed individuals become symptomatic due to B. anthracis exotoxin accumulation. the ease of production, ease of covalent attachment, and immunostimulatory activity of the NT-MDP indicate it would be a superior adjuvant to alum or other traditional adjuvants in vaccine formulations. 22 cases of infection resulted in 5 deaths, causing much concern regarding treatment, therapeutics and vaccine efficacy. the revocation of available vaccine has left healthcare workers, laboratory personnel and first responders with only limited means of protection following potential exposures to anthrax spore the current lack of an approved, available vaccine puts laboratory workers, military personnel and first responders at an increased risk of inhalational anthrax. passive immunotherapy is a non-chemical therapeutic providing immediate immunity to infectious agents and toxins. Bacillus anthracis produces two exotoxins, edema toxin (EdTx) and lethal toxin (LeTx) the two exotoxins utilize a common cell binding component called protective antigen (PA83, 83 kDa) a furin-like protease cleaves the full-length, inactive protein into the active form, PA63 (63 kDa) disruption of binding of PA to ATR or LF would disrupt internalization of functional LeTx. resulting polyclonal anti-sera conferred protection against in vitro and in vivo intoxication with the anthrax lethal toxin (LeTx) anthrax toxin proteins high-purity, histidine-tagged rLF and rPA83 were supplied by the Northeast Biodefense Center Protein Expression Core. a novel muramyl dipeptide adjuvant (NT-MDP) was oxidized with sodium meta periodate for 1 h. pepsin digestion (100 U/mg IgG) at pH 3.5 in 0.1 M glycine buffer for 24 h. purity and extent of digestion was determined by SDS-PAGE analysis. anti-sera titer determination ELISAs were performed in microtiter plates coated with rPA83 (10 nM) in 10 mM carbonate/bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.5) with a final coating volume of 50 l in vitro cytotoxicity and protection assays Macrophage-like cells were harvested by gentle scraping (no trypsin) and were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 6 104 cells/well in 100 l of complete medium. cells were incubated for 18\u201324 h or until > 90% confluency had been achieved. medium was removed, and cells were washed once in sterile PBS. in vivo protection assays Lethal toxin challenge Female Balb/c mice (average weight 17.5 g) were injected with 100 g LeTx in 200 l saline via intraperitoneal injection (5 per group) mice were injected on opposite side with 8 mg/kg anti-PA83 IgG or F(ab')2 in 200 l saline. purified rLF and rPA83 were supplied to Virionyx Corporation Ltd (Auckland, NZ) for caprine immunizations as follows. a novel muramyl dipeptide adjuvant (NT-MDP) was oxidized with sodium meta periodate (0.5 M) for 1 h and excess sodium meta periodate was removed by centrifugation followed by a water wash. resulting Schiff's base was reduced by the addition of ascorbic acid anti-sera titer determination ELISAs were performed in microtiter plates coated with rPA83 (10 nM) in 10 mM carbonate/bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.5) with a final coating volume of 50 l. plates were coated for 1 h then washed in water and blocked with 5% non-fat milk powder. the wells were then washed with water and reacted (2 h) with horseradish peroxida 100 l of leTx was added to cells at final concentrations of 1000 ng, 100 ng, 10 ng and 0.1 ng. for protection assays, 50 ng of leTx (2 TCEC50) was combined with varying dilutions of anti-PA83 IgG or F(ab')2 and incubated at 37\u00b0C. cell viability was determined using an MTT-based assay. Virulent B. anthracis spore intranasal challenge female Swiss Webster mice (average weight 25.2 g) were infected with approximately 5 104 B. anthracis Ames spores (5 LD50) by 20 l installations in each nares. mice were monitored twice daily for 14 d for signs of illness and death. spore intranasal challenge Female Swiss Webster mice (average weight 25.2 g) were infected with approximately 5 104 B. anthracis Ames spores (5 LD50) by 20 l installations in each nares. groups of 10 mice received saline at 1 hour post-infection or anti-PA83 IgG at 24 h post-infection (32 mg/kg) rPA83 titers were obtained from immunized goats on days 0, 27, 40, 54, 67, and 94. anti-PA83 titers were measured by ELISA by reacting serially diluted anti-PA83 IgG with 10 nM rPA83. asterisks indicate timings of 2nd (day 14), 3rd (day 28) and 4th (day 56) booster immunizations. anti-PA83 IgG and F(ab')2 protect cells against leTx-induced cytotoxicity. cell viability assays were used to determine percent protection. treatment of leTx exposed cells with anti-PA83 F(ab')2 showed equivalent protection at 7.5 g compared to whole IgG. at lower doses, there was an observable diminished protection afforded by anti-PA83 F(ab')2 compared to whole IgG. mice were first injected with 2LD100 (200 g LeTx) of recombinant leTx on the left side of the abdomen. this dose of leTx has been confirmed to be fatal to 100% of mice within 48 h post challenge. mice were injected with approximately 8 mg/kg anti-PA83 IgG or F(ab')2 immunotherapeutics on the right side of the abdomen. mice were challenged with virulent B. anthracis spores via intranasal infection route. mice received 5 LD50 B. anthracis Ames spores in 20 l instillations into each nares. at 4 d post-infection, only 20% of control mice survived. mice infected with 5 LD50 B. anthracis Ames spores by intranasal inoculation. control mice were monitored twice daily for signs of illness or death. bleed typically range from 0.5 ml for mice up to 200 ml for terminally bled rabbits. plasmapheresis of three goats generated liters of anti-PA83 serum within a very short time frame. the goats used to produce this material are part of a certified pathogen-free herd. many monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have been generated that are specific for the anthrax protective antigen. the majority of these MAbs do not demonstrate significant protection post-exposure and appear to require a blend of several MAbs in order to reduce the mortality associated with anthrax infections. the utility of F(ab')2 antisera derived from goats will reduce the potential for side-effects associated with patients who have a pre-existing sensitivity to goat proteins cell viability experiments established a TCEC50 of 25 ng LeTx. this dose of leTx is within the range of previously reported TCEC50s. based on this data, all subsequent in vitro protection assays were performed at 2 TCEC50 equivalent to a total of 50 ng LeTx per well. serially diluted goat anti-PA83 IgG reacted with 10 nM rPA83. day 0 is 1st immunization with PA83-NT-MDP. asterisks indicate timings of 2nd (day 14), 3rd (day 28) and 4th (day 56) booster immunizations. cells treated with varying concentrations of anti-PA83 IgG exhibited protection from leTx cytotoxicity in a dose-dependant manner. 7.5 g anti-PA83 IgG fully protected cells against leTx mediated cell death. 0.95 g offered minimal protection (35%) over the leTx treated control cells. Efficacy for the anti-PA83 IgG and F(ab')2 immunotherapeutics was established in an intraperitoneal leTx-challenge mouse model. mice were first injected with 2LD100 (200 g LeTx) of recombinant LeTx on the left side of the abdomen. this dose of leTx has been confirmed to be fatal to 100% of mice within 48 h post challenge. control mice (Saline, 3 in group) received 100 g LeTx followed by 200 l Saline. all surviving mice were euthanized at day 11 post-challenge. concomitant administration of Ciprofloxacin and anti-PA83 IgG completely protected mice for 6 days while Ciprofloxacin was administered. survival decreased to levels comparable to anti-PA83 IgG treatment alone. small animals are typically terminally bled in order to produce larger volumes of serum. the large number of animals required to produce the therapeutic quantities needed for a useful medical countermeasure stockpile (e.g., the SNS) makes these animals prohibitively expensive. studies are underway to evaluate the efficacy of the affinity purified materials, which may significantly reduce the amount of material required to offer significant protection in both animals and humans. the majority of these MAbs do not demonstrate significant protection post-exposure and appear to require a blend of several MAbs in order to reduce the mortality associated with anthrax infections. three goats immunized four times over a 56 day period produced liters of titer antisera capable of neutralizing anthrax lethal toxin both in vitro and in vivo. passive transfer of goat-derived antibodies 24 h post-exposure provided mice with a substantial survival advantage over untreated mice. asal mouse study was provided by the national Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases contract with the University of Texas Medical Branch.
