{"summary": "influenza strain may mimic 1918 pandemic's notoriously high death rate. current antiviral drugs (e.g., oseltamivir) have narrow window of efficacy. there is substantial need for new insights into the mechanisms of the disease that might lead to new therapeutics. infection with the H5N1 avian flu has been linked to nearly 60% fatality rate [15], although the total number of infections has been relatively limited. the pathophysiologic basis is the influenza-mediated damage to lung epithelium and endothelium, resulting in exudative inflammation. however, which factors determine the magnitude and extent of the host inflammatory response remain incompletely characterized. studies in which different mouse strains exhibited differences in mortality after infection with the same dose of influenza were identified. the data series fulfilling these criteria are all whole lung transcriptome profiles and are tabulated in Table 1. the more susceptible DBA/2 mice showed a greater viral load in the lungs at 48 h and higher amounts of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF, IFN-,-, CCL2). at 72 h after infection, 1,833 genes were significantly up- or downregulated, of which subsets (521 genes) were statistically different between the infected BL6 mice and BL6 mice. this study also identified 5 quantitative trait loci linked to influenza resistance. a defective Hc gene encodes the complement component C5 previously shown to be vital for resistance to influenza. some strain-dependent differences in pathways were identified using the KEGG database. pathway analysis using the Ingenuity IPA tool found 3 pathways that were only active in DBA/2J-infected mice. the findings included: \u201ceicosanoid signaling,\u201d \u201capoptosis signaling\u201d and \u201ccoagulation system\u201d. IFN- receptor deficiency decreased morbidity and mortality, lung damage, proinflammatory cytokines and infiltrating inflammatory cells when compared to infection in wild-type mice with normal receptor levels. receptor-deficient mice showed much lower amounts of proinflammatory cytokines, indicating a secondary and likely harmful effect of excess type I IFN signaling. gene ontology analysis found treatment resulted in decreased expression of inflammatory response genes and increased lung metabolic and repair responses. genes expressed in the vehicle-treated lungs were associated predominantly with immune responses and inflammation. a panel of inflammatory genes were upregulated in a susceptible strain (CAST/EiJ), 2 strains with intermediate resistance (C57BL/6J, 129S1/SvImJ) and 1 highly resistant strain (PWK/PhJ) the filtering revealed 8 genes that failed to be upregulated in CAST/EiJ mice. the specific role of the genes identified remains to be directly tested. mice deficient in RIPK3 (receptor interacting protein kinase 3) and wild-type mice were protected from mortality. mice deficient in IDO1 (indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase) were found to be protected against influenza by another group of investigators. ome data from early time points (12, 24, and 72 h) identified 547 genes that were differentially expressed. the same genes were robustly upregulated in the Mx1+/+ mice. apoptosis, cell migration, connective tissue disorders, and the production of reactive oxygen species are linked to resistance. a defective Hc gene encodes the complement component C5 previously shown to be vital for resistance to influenza [23]. some strain-dependent differences in pathways were identified using the KEGG database (http://www.kegg.jp) gene expression changes were attributable to altered or increased gene expression in mice. inflammatory and cytokine pathways were elevated in both groups of mice. authors attributed overrepresentation of proinflammatory genes to higher viral replication rates and larger viral loads. IFN- receptor deficiency decreased morbidity and mortality, lung damage, proinflammatory cytokines and infiltrating inflammatory cells when compared to infection in wild-type mice with normal receptor levels. receptor-deficient mice showed much lower amounts of proinflammatory cytokines, indicating a secondary and likely harmful effect of excess type I IFN signaling. genes expressed in the vehicle-treated lungs were associated predominantly with immune responses and inflammation. the authors focused their efforts on a search for genes that were exclusively upregulated in C57BL/6J. strains with intermediate resistance (C57BL/6J, 129S1/SvImJ) and 1 highly resistant strain (PWK/PhJ) initial analysis showed increased expression of a panel of inflammatory genes in CAST/EiJ mice compared to 129S1/SvImJ and C57BL/6J. PWK/PhJ mice showed minimal upregulation or even downregulation of these genes. mice deficient in RIPK3 (receptor interacting protein kinase 3) and wild-type mice were protected from mortality in other studies. mice deficient in IDO1 (indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase) were found to be protected against influenza by another group of investigators. network analysis identified apoptosis, cell migration, connective tissue disorders, and the production of reactive oxygen species as being linked to resistance. apoptosis, cell migration, connective tissue disorders, and the production of reactive oxygen species were also linked to resistance. a variation of the \u201cvote-counting\u201d method [40] was used. this method counts the frequency of genes or pathways identified as significant (up- or downregulated) in a group of studies. the method may fail to find \u201chits\u201d that would be identified with more complex methods, but those positives identified are likely to represent strong signals that can be detected by this less powerful methodology. DEGs from infected versus mock samples from high- and low-mortality groups in each study were compared using Venn diagram tools to identify DEGs unique to the high-survivor or high-mortality group. the reanalysis effort generated a total of 38 gene lists comprised of DEGs corresponding to the various days of infection represented in the studies in Table 1. frequency evaluation of datasets from susceptible mice identified 248 upregulated genes shared by 8 or more of the 14 available comparisons. results of pathway and drug identification efforts were similar to those obtained using a more comprehensive analysis of all of the up- and downregulated genes from each individual study. the frequency of pathways in each group was counted to allow the ranking of frequency across the studies. KEGG database analysis also found the most common pathways to be cell cycle and cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, but these were found in only 7 and 5 studies. the lower yield in downregulated pathways may reflect a generally lower number of downregulated DEGs compared to those upregulated in the gene signatures. RNA sequencing-based transcriptome profiling offers an increased dynamic range and, once more datasets become available, it may be possible to gain further insights. gene lists can be compared to the database to identify in rank order agents that produce a similar (correlated) mRNA profile (signature) or those that produce an opposite (anticorrelated) signature. this allows rapid identification of potential inhibitors that would downregulate the signature associated with high mortality in these susceptible mice. alvocidib 32 CDK9 GSK-2126458 28 PI3K mTOR Trametinib 27 MEK Selumetinib 26 MEK AZD-8330 25 MEK NVP-AUY922 24 HSP90 Palbociclib 23 CDK4, 6 BMS-387032 21 CDK2, 7, 9 PD-184352 21 MEK Mitoxantrone 18 type II topoisomerase Radicicol 18 HSP90 Afatinib a number of MEK inhibitors are in use or under investigation in human cancer patients. the available evidence for the potential of CDK inhibitors is mixed. a number of agents are available as inhibitors of the mammalian target of rapamycin. no in vivo studies have been reported to date. the identification of mitoxantrone, a type II topoisomerase inhibitor, is intriguing in view of the recent finding that type I topoisomerase inhibition suppresses inflammatory genes and protects from death by inflammation. the single RNASeq study, the Partek Flow software package, was used for analysis, with a workflow that subjected the downloaded FASTQ files to alignment using the STAR program [41]. the data was quantified using the Gencode mm10 reference mouse genome, normalized by total count, and analysis of differential gene expressions using the STAR program. the frequency of DEGs in each group were counted to allow the ranking of frequency across the studies (vote counting) Enrichr offers 3 approaches to compute enrichment. the first is the standard Fisher exact test. this is a proportion test that assumes a binomial distribution and independence for probability of any gene belonging to any set. an Enrichr-based query of the Reactome database identified 10 pathways shared by more than half of the studies. KEGG database analysis also found the most common pathways to be cell cycle and cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions. this type of analysis produced more shared results when applied to the upregulated genes in the susceptible group. a generally lower number of downregulated DEGs compared to those upregulated in the gene signatures.
