{"summary": "critically ill patients admitted via the emergency department were enrolled at the time of triage to the ICU. patients with at least one organ dysfunction were classified as severe sepsis. hypotension, need for mechanical ventilation, oliguria, altered mental status, and lactic acidosis were examples of organ dysfunction. sample size was determined based on a prior gene expression study of sepsis-related ARDS. 29 of these patients had sepsis without lung injury and 28 had sepsis with ARDS. cDNA was hybridized to the Affymetrix Human GeneChip Gene 1.0 ST array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) integrating 28,869 genes with 764,885 probes (26 probes per gene) the experimental design, RNA extraction, and microarray processing and bioinformatics were MIAME compliant. housekeeping genes glucoronidase beta (GUSB) and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT1) were also measured. real-time qPCR was performed with the ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) differences in patient age, sex, RNA processing, and peripheral WBC can introduce variability in expression levels. a patient with a WBC of 18,000 cells/l may have increased expression of some genes simply due to an increase in the number of neutrophils rather than a functional upregulation of the neutrophil itself. we systematically searched PubMed for relevant basic and clinical studies reporting that the genes or their products were relevant to the pathogenesis of ARDS. both human and animal research was included. patients with at least one organ dysfunction were classified as severe sepsis. hypotension, need for mechanical ventilation, oliguria, altered mental status, and lactic acidosis were examples of organ dysfunction. ARDS diagnosis was determined by two board-certified intensive care physicians blinded to the microarray outcome data. patients were divided into those with and those without ARDS. RNA was extracted by using the PAXgene miRNA kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and processed in two separate batches. lipocalin 2 was quantified in duplicate and in a blinded fashion using a commercially available two-antibody sandwich ELISA. quantitative reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) confirmation. the lowest value was set to a relative quantity of 1. a message was undetected after 40 cycles of PCR. we accounted for indirect (nonpulmonary) vs. direct (pneumonia or aspiration) risk factors for lung injury. in model 1 we adjusted for age, batch number, sex, and WBC. in model 2 we adjusted for all characteristics in model 1 and for presence of direct lung injury as a risk factor. we included all differentially expressed genes with FDR 0.25 and log2 fold change of >0.2625 using the Ingenuity Pathways Analysis application (16, 58) the reported P values are derived by using corrections for multiple comparisons and provide an estimate of the probability that a given enrichment is present by chance alone. patients were defined as having ARDS if they met criteria as defined by the Berlin definition of ARDS within 24 h of enrollment to the study (51). patients were excluded if they had an equivocal diagnosis of ARDS based on chest radiograph or absent arterial blood gas. patients were also excluded if whole blood suitable for RNA isolation was not collected. RNA was extracted by using the PAXgene miRNA kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and processed in two separate batches balanced for cases and controls. labeled cDNA was hybridized to the Affymetrix Human GeneChip Gene 1.0 ST array (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA), integrating 28,869 genes with 764,885 probes. differentially expressed genes were selected for quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) confirmation. qPCR was performed with the ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) normalized array values were reported on a log2 scale. for statistical analyses, we removed all array probesets in which no experimental groups had an average log2 intensity >3.0. t-statistics, fold change, and statistical significance were calculated for each gene. differentially expressed genes in ARDS were related to more prevalent shock in the ARDS subgroup. we selected differentially expressed genes with an a priori cutpoint of >1 log2 fold change and a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.25. the FDR values indicate the expected fraction of falsely declared differentially expressed genes among the total set of differentially expressed genes. the baseline and clinical characteristics of the study sample according to ARDS diagnosis are described in Table 1. septic patients with ARDS were more severely ill than sepsis patients without ARDS with significantly increased APACHE III scores. of 28,127 genes annotated on the array, 24,403 (97%) met an average log2 intensity >3. differentially expressed genes meeting a cut point of >1 log2 fold difference and FDR 0.25 are presented in Table 2. PubMed Search completed March 12, 2014. Table 3. Top differentially expressed genes in sepsis and ARDS vs. sepsis alone in model 1 adjusted analysis. the most differentially expressed genes and degree of relative differential expression in unadjusted analysis were similar to those in the whole cohort. the FDRs were somewhat increased in this subgroup, likely attributable to decreased sample size (data not shown).

IPA, Ingenuity Pathways Analysis. DISCUSSION This study compared the early transcriptional differences of whole blood leukocytes in critically ill septic patients with and without ARDS. the role of LCN 2 in ARDS is not fully known. it may mediate the antimicrobial effect of mesenchymal stem cells in experimental gram-negative pneumonia (34). it has also been associated with deactivation of macrophages and induction of an immunosuppressive M2 phenotype in gram-positive pneumonia (63). the BPI protein is stored in neutrophil granules and has a pluripotent antimicrobial effect via neutralization of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and a highly selective bactericidal effect on gram-negative organisms (17, 48, 64) this gene is expressed by neutrophils and may play. a recent murine study of OLFM4/ mice demonstrated enhanced in vivo bacterial clearance and more resistance to bacterial challenge. the downregulated genes identified had less consistency across the unadjusted and adjusted models. if these genes have significance in ARDS pathogenesis remains unclear. new advances in microfluidic-based capture of human neutrophils will make these approaches feasible (39, 62) the most differentially expressed genes were the same in unadjusted analysis. patients with ARDS had significantly more shock and a higher severity of illness. mRNA expression with plasma protein levels of LCN 2 suggests one of every four genes considered could be a false positive. the study is the largest gene expression study of sepsis-related ARDS. the preponderance of cell death and apoptosis pathways identified is biologically plausible in the pathogenesis of ARDS. this study validates possible roles for several genes previously identified in microarray studies of sepsis-related ARDS. our cutoff point of 0.25 suggests that one of every four genes considered could be a false positive. we supplemented our analysis with a literature search on each gene to determine biological plausibility. this is the largest gene expression study of sepsis-related ARDS to date. the preponderance of cell death and apoptosis pathways identified is biologically plausible in the pathogenesis of ARDS and may serve as preliminary data for future hypotheses. larger studies are warranted and should consider subgroups matched according to severity of illness and shock to further evaluate the possibility that mechanisms of ARDS may differ among patients. a literature search on each gene yielded relevant and plausible results. this is the largest gene expression study of sepsis-related ARDS to date. this study is the largest gene expression study of sepsis-related ARDS. gene expression subphenotypes can be identified early in the course of sepsis, with higher expression of several genes in septic patients with ARDS. these data identify biologically plausible genes with known neutrophil-related functions that are likely to be important in the early pathogenesis of ARDS.
