{"summary": "CHIKV belongs to the genus Alphavirus of the family togaviridae. it is an enveloped virus with a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome (40) CHIKV is transmitted to humans by means of an arthropod vector such as the Aedes mosquito. there is currently no licensed vaccine against CHIKV for human use. anti-CHIKV IgM antibodies can be detected in the patient serum during the acute phase of disease. anti-CHIKV IgG are detected after virus clearance and can persist for several months after infection. this is the first comprehensive study where multiple linear B-cell epitopes covering the entire CHIKV proteome have been identified directly from anti-CHIKV antibodies obtained from CHIKV-infected patients. able Disease Centre at Tan Tock Seng Hospital (CDC/TTSH), Singapore, during the outbreak from 1 August to 23 September 2008 (25, 47), were included in this study. samples from these patients were previously used in a separate study where acute and recovery phases were compared. written informed consent was obtained from all participants. all positive clones were screened by restriction analysis and confirmed by DNA sequencing. CHIKV proteins were expressed in HEK 293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions, with some modifications. proteins from CHIK virions and protein lysate preparations were separated by 6% and 10% SDS-PAGE, respectively, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. membranes were blocked overnight in blocking buffer (Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20 [TBST] supplemented with 5% dry milk and 3% FBS), followed by 1 h of incubation. mouse anti-human IgG (Molecular Probe) and isotype IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4 antibodies (Molecular Probe) validated previously for specificity and reactivity. ELISA readings were done in duplicate, and the values were plotted as means standard errors of the means. readout was detected with TMB substrate solution (Sigma-Aldrich) and terminated with sulfuric acid (Sigma-Aldrich) absorption was measured at 450 nm in a microplate autoreader (Tecan) a two-sided P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. nine patients were admitted with acute CHIKF to the Communicable Disease Centre at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore. cDNA clones were synthesized and subcloned into pDisplay expression vector (Invitrogen) to form pDisplay-nsP1, -nsP2, -nsP3, -nsP4, -capsid (C), -E2, -E1, -E3, and -6K expression plasmids. all positive clones were screened by restriction analysis and confirmed by DNA sequencing. protein lysates were mixed with Laemmli buffer and stored at 20\u00b0C. blots were exposed to films (Pierce, Thermo Scientific) and developed. polystyrene 96-well microtiter plates were coated with purified CHIKV. wells were blocked with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat milk. plasma samples were then diluted at 1:100 to 1:2,000 in PBST-milk. peptides were diluted in 0.1% PBST (0.1% Tween 20 in PBS) plates were rinsed, followed by incubation with anti-human antibodies conjugated to HRP diluted in 0.1% blocking buffer for 1 h. readout was detected with TMB substrate solution (Sigma-Aldrich) and terminated with sulfuric acid (Sigma-Aldrich) HEK 293T cells were seeded into 96-well plates and incubated for 1.5 h at 37\u00b0C. medium was removed, cells were replenished with DMEM medium supplied with 5% FBS and incubated for 6 h at 37\u00b0C before fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde. a two-sided P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. plasma samples from each of these patients contained antibodies that displayed neutralizing activity when assessed in seroneutralization assays. neutralizing activity of antibodies from CHIKV-infected patient plasma was sustained until 21 months PIO, even at different plasma dilutions. CHIK virions were purified from the supernatants of cells infected with CHIKV originating from Reunion Island (IMT) (5) or from Singapore (SGP11) (11) protein extracts were isolated under reducing and nonreducing conditions. reactivity was stronger with SGP11 CHIKV than with IMT CHIKV. individual plasma samples (2 to 3 months and 21 months PIO) were tested against either IMT or SGP11 viruses at dilutions between 1:500 and 1:8,000 (2-fold dilutions) results are expressed as percentage of control infection. patients plasma also contained antibodies against E2 glycoprotein and capsid protein. only anti-E2 antibodies persisted until 21 months PIO. two linear epitope-containing regions of the nsP3 protein (Fig. 4A), one region in the capsid protein (Fig. 4B), and several regions in the E2 glycoprotein (Fig. 4D) were identified. pooled CHIKV-infected patient plasma (2 to 3 months and 21 months PIO) were subjected to peptide-based ELISA covering the CHIKV proteome. nsP3 protein, capsid protein, and E3 glycoprotein have dominant linear epitopes within the viral proteins. nsP3 protein, capsid protein, and E3 glycoprotein have about 6% of antibody recognition. antibodies from all patients against the immunodominant region E2-P1 or E2EP3 epitope (15) are still present after 21 months PIO. pooled CHIKV-infected patient plasma (2 to 3 months PIO) were subjected to peptide-based ELISA covering the CHIKV genome encoding the nonstructural and structural proteins of CHIKV. the number corresponds to the amino acid positions along the CHIKV viral genome. the first amino acid from nsP1 is annotated as 1. Schematic representation of identified B-cell epitopes in nsP3, capsid, and nsP3 proteins. epitopes in the capsid and nsP3 proteins were located based on structural data predicted by the I-TASSER server. CHIKV-infected patient plasma showed stronger neutralizing capacity against CHIKV carrying Q252 (SGP11 isolate) than CHIKV carrying K252 (IMT isolate). a single amino acid residue difference could contribute to the differential binding capacity of patient plasma antibodies to various CHIKV isolates. CHIKV-infected patient plasma (2 to 3 months PIO) was used as a negative control. data are expressed as optical density (OD) with background signals subtracted. results are representative of 3 independent experiments. plasma from each patient was quantified by the SGP11 virion-based ELISA. high levels of anti-SGP11 CHIKV-specific IgG antibody responses were detected at 2 to 3 months PIO. however, even though the levels decreased over time, they were still detectable at 21 months PIO. individual plasma samples were determined at dilutions of 1:100 and 1:500 using specific secondary antibodies. data are presented as mean SEM of 9 patient samples and are representative of 3 independent experiments with similar results. anti-CHIKV antibodies show polymorphic epitopes recognition and differential neutralizing capacities against different CHIKV isolates. purified CHIK virions from IMT and SGP11 were prepared under reducing (100\u00b0C for 5 min with DTT) and nonreducing conditions. cell lysates were prepared from transiently expressed nonstructural protein 1 (nsP1), nonstructural protein 2 (nsP2), nonstructural protein 3 (nsP3), and nonstructural protein 4 (nsP4). antigens recognized by CHIKV-infected patient plasma are indicated by solid arrows. ide-based ELISAs using a peptide library (Mimotopes) were performed with pooled plasma samples using an optimized plasma dilution established for these assays (15). Interestingly, two linear epitope-containing regions of the nsP3 protein (Fig. 4A), one region in the capsid protein (Fig. 4B), one region in the E3 glycoprotein (Fig. 4C), and several regions in the E2 glycoprotein (Fig. 4D nsP1 protein, capsid protein, and E3 glycoprotein have dominant linear epitopes within the viral proteins and possess about 6% of antibody recognition. nsP3 protein, capsid protein, and E3 glycoprotein have corresponding dominant linear epitopes within the viral proteins. capsid protein is located at the C terminus of the protein, while epitopes for the E2 glycoprotein are distributed along the entire viral protein. antibodies from all patients against the immunodominant region E2-P1 or E2EP3 epitope (15) are still present after 21 months PIO. the number corresponds to the amino acid positions along the CHIKV viral genome. the first amino acid from nsP1 is annotated as 1. The numbers correspond to the amino acid positions along the chikV viral genome. localization of CHIKV B-cell epitopes within the CHIKV proteome. epitopes in the capsid and nsP3 proteins were located based on structures predicted by the I-TASSER server. CHIKV-infected patient plasma showed stronger neutralizing capacity against CHIKV carrying Q252 (SGP11 isolate) than CHIKV carrying K252 (IMT isolate) deep-sequencing analysis was carried out to identify potential sequence differences at the amino acid level. biotinylated synthetic peptides encoding the K252 (VPRNAELGDRKGKIHIPF) and Q252 (VPRNAELGDRQGKIHIPF) amino acid residues were screened with CHIKV-infected patient plasma at an optimized dilution of 1:2,000. we have performed the first comprehensive and longitudinal analysis of the antibody response against CHIKV linear determinants. the antibody response against linear determinants was attributed to a persisting IgG3 response that was detectable even at 21 months PIO. s exist in other surface-exposed viral proteins and in other alphaviruses. s exist in other surface-exposed viral proteins and in other alphaviruses. antibodies directed against the E3 glycoprotein have been shown to protect mice against infections from equine encephalitis virus. CHIKV induces apoptosis in infected cells. apoptotic blebs containing CHIKV facilitate infection of new cells in a noninflammatory manner. this would limit the presentation of CHIKV antigens solely expressed in host cells. study reported the importance of acid-sensitive regions (ASRs) in regulating antibody recognition and conformational changes. one of our identified B-cell epitopes matched with one of our identified B-cell epitopes (between amino acids 231 and 258)"}
