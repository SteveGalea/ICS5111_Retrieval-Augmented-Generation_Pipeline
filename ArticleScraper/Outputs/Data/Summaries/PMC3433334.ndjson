{"summary": "the duration of immunity provided by an inactivated FeLV vaccine, Versifel FeLV, when administered to cats of the target age was determined. kittens received two vaccinations when aged 7 to 9 weeks old, and were challenged up to 36 months later with the FeLV-A Glasgow isolate. viraemic animals do not respond to FeLV antigens and show limited response to the virus, and are at higher risk of developing fatal disease. cats which recover from the infection produce virus neutralising antibodies which are considered important in preventing re-infection and can be passed through colostrum. study design 20 month duration of immunity Treatment Group Test Article (TA) Dose Volume TA Days of TA Admin Route of TA Day of FeLV Challenge Volume/ Route of Challenge Number of Animals T04 Water for Injection 1 mL 0, 21 SC 631 1 mL/IP 11 T05 Versifel FeLV 1 mL 0, 21 SC 1143 1 mL/IP 16 T06 - - - - - 631 1 mL/IP 6 Table 3 cats were equally split between males and females in all treatment groups. all study animals were negative for FeLV p27 antigen, and anti-FOCMA and gp70 antibodies prior to vaccination. a sufficient volume of the frozen FeLV isolate stock was thawed in a sterile container. the authors indicated that this challenge titre, volume and route of administration were sufficient to result in FeLV infection in younger animals. cats and kittens had a physical examination prior to enrolment and vaccination. blood samples collected from each animal were stored overnight in a refrigerator and centrifuged the following day for approximately 15 minutes. serum was harvested from each tube and divided into two aliquots, labelled and stored frozen in cryogenic tubes at -70 \u00b0C. secondary variables Gp70 antibody and anti-FOCMA antibody results were summarised by treatment group and time. Rectal temperature was summarised by calculating descriptive statistics including the mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum, by treatment group and day. a third group of young kittens was added to each study immediately prior to challenge. study design 36 month duration of immunity Treatment Group Test Article (TA) Dose Volume TA Days of TA Admin Route of TA Day of FeLV Challenge Volume/ Route of Challenge Number of animals T07 Water for Injection 1 mL 0, 21 SC 1143 1 mL/IP 11 T08 Versifel FeLV 1 mL 0, 21 SC 1143 1 mL/IP 16 T09 - - - 1143 1 mL/IP 6 Animals were examined for the presence of the viral challenge suspension was prepared by a 1:10 dilution of the stock virus to a target concentration of 5.78 x 105 ffu/mL using sterile DMEM and HEPES buffers as diluents. the site for the intraperitoneal injection was the caudolateral aspect of the right ventral abdomen. blood samples were collected from all three groups on a weekly basis. blood samples were collected from each kitten in T04 and T05 on study days 1 and 617. blood samples were collected from each kitten in T07 and T08 on study days -1, 100, 982 and 1052. the presence of gp70 antibodies was evaluated by ELISA according to the test kit instructions. for the gp70 antibody ELISA a titre greater than 90 was considered positive. for anti-FOCMA antibodies a titre greater than 20 was considered positive. persistent antigenaemia for an animal was defined (as per Pharmacopoeia) as being when an animal was positive for the p27 antigen for three consecutive weeks or on five separate occasions (consecutively or not) from the third week to the fifteenth week after FeLV challenge. 0 4 0 0 1 0 1 42.3 617 T04 (n = 11) 9 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 14.9 T05 (n = 16) 5 1 1 0 1 1 2 1 0 1 1 0 36.5 629 T06 (n = 6) 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 10 T08 (n = baseline serum samples of cats in groups T01, T02, T04, T05, T07 and T08 were negative for FeLV p27 antigen, gp70 antibodies (i.e. 90;
