{"summary": "index cases were identified from the pediatric outpatient clinic of queen Sirikit National Institute of Child Health, the largest public referral hospital in Bangkok. a randomized controlled trial was designed to study the effect of hand-washing education with and without the use of a face mask on secondary influenza transmission in Bangkok, Thailand (14). the SI was calculated as the time (in days) between symptom onset in the index case and symptom onset in the household contacts with an influenza virus. we used a nonparametric generalization of the Kaplan-Meier estimator that accounts for left-truncation resulting from the study design (16\u201319) the mixture models were found to be a poor fit to the data. the mixture models, however, were found to be a poor fit to the data. we performed multivariable analysis by using accelerated failure time models. index cases were identified from the pediatric outpatient clinic of queen Sirikit National Institute of Child Health, the largest public referral hospital in Bangkok. no household members had influenza-like illness in the previous 2 weeks. onset in the index case and symptom onset in the household contacts with an influenza virus confirmed by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (2). we chose to base the SI on a single discrete symptom\u2014reported fever\u2014for 2 reasons: 1) Fever is the only symptom common to all index cases because of the inclusion criteria for the index case; therefore using fever as the symptom included the greatest number of households. the mixture models were found to be a poor fit to the data. the mixture models were found to be a poor fit to the data. the mixture parameters were not identifiable when we fitted the model. 44 dropped out (n = 9), moved (n = 4), were hospitalized (index cases) (n = 7), were negative for influenza virus by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (n = 16), or otherwise found ineligible (n = 8) 20 households in which the reported onset of the first symptom was more than 2 days before enrollment. 49 32.4 88 11.5 135 17.6 Households with 1 laboratory-confirmed secondary influenza infection 378 136 36.0 140 37.0 45 11.9 57 15.1 Households with symptomatic secondary infection 342 126 36.8 127 37.1 41 12.0 48 14.0 Households with 1 fever 251 98 39.0 86 34.3 30 12.0 37 14.7 Individual levela Household members with serial interval 315 125 39.7 111 35.2 35 11.1 no. % P Valuea No. % P Valuea Total 251 100 98 39.0 30 11.9 86 34.3 37 14.7 Age, yearsb 5.5 (3.4) 0.0001c 6.4 (3.4) Age group, years 0\u20132 57 22.7 0.01e 16 16.3 Reference 7 23.3 0.01e 30 34.9 0.01e 4 10.8 0.25e 3\u20135 79 31.5 26 26.5 15 50.0 31 36.0 7 18.9 6\u201310 91 3 1%; A(H3N2) = 31.6%; A(H1N1) = 25.9%; and influenza B = 25.9%. there was no significant difference between influenza virus types with regard to the distribution of time spent within 1 m of the index case. the median value for the SI with the nonparametric method was 2.7 days. the lognormal model had the lowest Akaike Information Criterion value. the lognormal model had the lowest Akaike Information Criterion value. the AF indicates the proportional increase (>1) or decrease (1) in the median household serial interval associated with each characteristic. the AF indicates the proportional increase (>1) or decrease (1) in the median household serial interval associated with each characteristic. only the SI for influenza virus type B was significantly longer (P = 0.03). the model parameters correspond to SIs for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, influenza A(H3N2), and influenza B of 3.2 (SD, 1.55), 3.2 (SD, 1.6), 3.5 (SD, 1.7) and 3.8 (SD, 1.9) days, respectively. we found the SI based on acute respiratory illness was 3.1 (SD, 1.5) days, shorter than that based on fever alone (n = 414; data not shown) to explain this, we found that cough and sore throat occurred earlier than fever among the infected household members. the results of the multivariable analysis based on acute respiratory illness were similar, with the exception that the SI for influenza A(H1N1) was significantly shorter than that for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. the incubation period for influenza A(H1N1)pdm2009 is estimated to be 1.4\u20131.6 days (21\u201323) therefore, SIs of 2 days or less that were left-truncated would be slightly more common. however, we did account for left-truncation in our nonparametric analysis. our multivariate model includes time spent in proximity to the index patient. proximity to the index case represents an increased frequency of exposure to an influenza virus by the household contact. we cannot adjust for the possibility that some index cases actually might have been secondary cases because a subclinical infection of another member of the household preceded that of the presumed index child. the result of such mixing would be an overestimate of the SI. up to 25% of household members were not enrolled in the study. households in urban Bangkok are likely to experience more crowding than the average household in more developed parts of the world. these circumstances likely result in shorter estimated SIs. despite these limitations, our study has notable strengths."}
