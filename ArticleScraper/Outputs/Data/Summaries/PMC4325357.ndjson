{"summary": "study aim was to investigate an outbreak of human cases of unexplained influenza-like illness and fatal acute respiratory infection (ARI), with simultaneous poultry illness and high mortality raising concerns of possible influenza A (H5N1), virus in cote d'ivoire. influenza was registered on the list of diseases under surveillance within the framework of the integrated disease surveillance and response (IDSR) since the year 2008. recent discovery of avian influenza A (H5N1) virus in Asia sparked concern of a possible epidemic. villagers reported to have had runny nose, cough, sneezes and diarrhoea. the disease quickly progressed and death occurred between day-3 to day-5. a team of investigators was sent to the site to investigate the cases. the search for cases and contacts included the neighboring health area of Ti\u00e9massoba. only nasopharyngeal specimens were collected from all living persons meeting the case definition. no specimens were collected from persons who recovered from their illness. l was used as the template for reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) RNA was reverse transcribed and amplified in a 50 l reaction containing 25 l of 2X RT-PCR buffer (Invitrogen), 4 U RNase inhibitor (Promega), 1 l RT-PCR enzyme mix (Invitrogen), 0.6 M each primer. we simultaneously amplified a 245 base pair fragment on the M gene of influenza A viruses using cular detection consisted of three multiplex RT-PCR reactions targeting 12 RNA respiratory viruses simultaneously. influenza viruses A, B and C, human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), parainfluenza viruses types 1\u20134 (PIV-1, -2, -3 and -4), human Coronaviruses OC43 and 229E (HCoV) and rhinovirus (hRV). nasopharyngeal swab samples were kept at 4\u00b0C and sent to the Pasteur Institute of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire for analysis. RNA preparation Specimens from persons were transported in viral transport media to the Pasteur Institute of Cote d'Ivoire. RNA was eluted in 60 l of nuclease-free water and 10 l was used as the template for reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) RNA was amplified in a 50 l reaction containing 25 l of 2X RT-PCR buffer (Invitrogen), 4 U RNase inhibitor (Promega), 1 l RT-PCR enzyme mix (Invitrogen), 0.6 M each primer. three multiplex hemi-nested RT-PCR reactions targeted 12 RNA respiratory viruses simultaneously. influenza viruses A, B and C, human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), parainfluenza viruses types 1\u20134 (PIV-1, -2, -3 and -4), human Coronaviruses OC43 and 229E (HCoV) and rhinovirus (hRV). rate case/1000 female male 0\u20134 13 18 7 22.6 261 118.8 5\u20139 7 4 4 36.4 229 48.0 10\u201314 8 6 3 21.4 198 70.7 15 14 34 17 35.4 812 59.3 Total 42 62 31 29.8 1500 69.3 The deaths were observed in all the age groups. RT-PCR analysis of amplified products from nasopharyngial swabs. tests for other respiratory viruses showed three (4%) specimens were positive for a respiratory virus. one sample was positive for influenza C virus and 2 for HCoV OC43. thirty-one deaths with respiratory diseases arose since January 18, 2006. with 5 deaths each week from 25 till 31 December 2006 and from 08 till 14 January 2007 and with 10 deaths during the week of January 29 through February 04, 2007. hypotheses were formulated as possible cause of such an outbreak. influenza A (H5N1) virus was identified in a sub-Saharan africa country in 2006. in the same year, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire was the sixth african country to identify the virus. specimens from sick and dead birds and those from humans ill with respiratory disease were sampled. studies suggest that HCoV-229E and HCoV OC43 cause 5 to 30% of human respiratory tract infections. the HCoV OC43 virus, which is generally considered to cause colds, has been described to cause lower respiratory tract infections (pneumonia and bronchitis) in infants and elderly persons. human deaths from acute respiratory distress and animals' deaths occurred between January and March 2007. this delay was due to unstable socio-political situation in C\u00f4te d'ivoire. the investigation was practically made at the end of outbreak. investigation carried out in Diobala showed the circulation of two respiratory viruses: human Coronavirus OC43 and influenza C virus. it is unlikely that they were the cause of the outbreak, but our findings highlight the importance of a rapid outbreak investigation with good laboratory diagnostics."}
