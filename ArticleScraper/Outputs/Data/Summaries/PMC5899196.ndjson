{"summary": "infections by PRRSV often result in delayed, low-level induction of antiviral cytokines. ubiquitin (Ub)-proteasome system (UPS) is an important target for the virus to help itself better achieve its life cycle (3\u20135) LUBAC-induced NF-B and proinflammatory cytokine expression can be inhibited in the early phase of PRRSV infection. ubiquitination and deubiquitination are now considered important processes in the regulation of intracellular signals. OTULIN depletion leads to enhanced formation of linear Ub chains. binding of OTULIN to the PUB domain of HOIP controls NF-B signaling (25). unphosphorylated OTULIN is an important component of the LUBAC complex. analyses of the functions of porcine OTULIN were performed in this study. we infected 3D4/21 cells with PRRSV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.5. total RNA was extracted from the cells at different time points postinfection. 3D4/21 cells were subjected to mock infection or infected with PRRSV. at 24 h postinfection, cells were collected and subjected to Western blotting. data represent results of flow cytometry analysis of endogenous OTULIN protein expression levels. the results of Western blot analysis were consistent with those obtained using qRT-PCR. however, the titer in cells after transfection of the plasmid was higher than the titer seen with the control cells. in order to clarify the effect of OTULIN on PRRSV proliferation, we designed OTULIN small interfering RNA (siRNA) the enhancement of OTULIN on PRRSV is related to innate immunity. the enhancement of OTULIN on PRRSV is related to innate immunity. 3D4/21 cells were transfected with OTULIN expression plasmid or control plasmid. after 18 h, cells were infected with VSV-GFP at an MOI of 0.1. after 18 h, cells were infected with VSV-GFP at an MOI of 0.1. RT-PCR analysis (f) and WB (g) at 24 h postinfection. results were normalized to the -actin control gene data. data are representative of results from three independent experiments. after 24 h, the infected cells were collected and the cellular ubiquitin levels were analysed by WB. OTULIN interaction with Nsp11. we hypothesized that there is an unknown effect of the relationship between OTULIN and PRRSV Nsp1 or Nsp11. 293T cells were cotransfected with Flag-OTULIN and Nsp1-Myc. at 24 h after transfection, the cell lysates were precipitated with an anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (MAb) and were further detected by Western blotting performed with an anti-Flag MAb antibody. mapped the domains of OTULIN and constructed the corresponding truncated body. OTULIN consisted of a PIM domain and an OTU domain. the PIM domain is responsible for the combination with LUBAC. the key to the binding was the OTU domain. 293T cells were cotransfected with Nsp11-Myc and Flag-OTULIN (aa 1 to 79), Flag-OTULIN (aa 80 to 353) or Flag-OTULIN (aa 1 to 353) at 24 h posttransfection, the cell lysates were precipitated with an anti-Myc MAb in conjunction with protein A Sepharose. the effects of different mutants on the linear ubiquitination were detected by WB. HEK 293T cells were cotransfected with Nsp11-Myc and Flag-IKK, Flag-IKK, or Flag-NEMO. results showed that Nsp11 could be coprecipitated with NEMO, IKK, and IKK. a recruitment effect on endogenous OTULIN targeting NEMO was observed. 293T cells were cotransfected with flag-NEMO, HA-KO, and Nsp11-Myc or blank vector. at 24 h posttransfection, the cell lysates were precipitated with an anti-Flag MAb in conjunction with protein A Sepharose. the cells were fixed at 24 h posttransfection and stained with a rabbit anti-Myc MAb and a mouse anti-Flag antibody. the linear ubiquitination-specific deubiquitinase OTULIN had no effect on K48 or K63 polyubiquitination. previous studies have shown that PRRSV Nsp11 specifically removed K48 ubiquitination but had no effect on K63 ubiquitination. Nsp11 has no significant effect on linear ubiquitination levels. HEK 293T cells were transfected with Flag-OTULIN, Nsp11-Myc, and HA-K48, HA-K63. at 24 h posttransfection, the cells were collected and analyzed by WB. Nsp11 further reduces type I interferon production by recruiting OTULIN. HEK 293T cells were transfected with Nsp11-Myc, Flag-OTULIN, or mutant. at 12 h posttransfection, cells were infected with SeV (MOI of 0.5) or left uninfected. mRNA levels of NF-B (a), IRF3 (b) and IFN- (c) were analyzed by qRT-PCR. analyses of the functions of porcine OTULIN were performed in this study. we infected 3D4/21 cells with PRRSV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.5. compared to the control group results, PRRSV infection resulted in a significant increase in mRNA levels of OTULIN. 3D4/21 cells were subjected to mock infection or infected with PRRSV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.5. at 24 h postinfection, cells were collected and subjected to RT-PCR. the virus titer in cells after transfection of the plasmid was higher than the titer seen with the control cells. in order to clarify the effect of OTULIN on PRRSV proliferation, we designed OTULIN small interfering RNA (siRNA) the changes in cellular OTULIN expression were consistent with PRRSV proliferation. the enhancement of OTULIN on PRRSV is related to innate immunity. IFN- plays critical roles in the innate immune responses to viral infection. 3D4/21 cells were transfected with OTULIN expression plasmid or control plasmid. after 18 h, cells were infected with VSV-GFP at an MOI of 0.1. after 18 h, cells were infected with VSV-GFP at an MOI of 0.1. OTULIN enhances the PRRSV deubiquitination effect. previous reports indicated that PRRSV infection led to reduced ubiquitination of cellular proteins (22). we hypothesized that there is an unknown effect of the relationship between OTULIN and PRRSV Nsp1 or Nsp11. each of which is a major protein related to ubiquitination or deubiquitination. the interaction of OTULIN with PRRSV Nsp11 by pulldown is shown. the cells were fixed at 24 h posttransfection and double stained with a rabbit anti-Myc MAb and a mouse anti-Flag antibody followed by FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (green) OTULIN consisted of amino acids (aa) 1 to 79, aa 49 to 353, and aa 80 to 353. the PIM domain is responsible for the combination with LUBAC. the key to the binding was the OTU domain. HEK 293T cells were transfected with Flag-OTULIN or mutants. at 12 h posttransfection, cells were infected with SeV (MOI of 0.5) or left uninfected. PRRSV Nsp11 has a recruitment effect on endogenous OTULIN targeting NEMO. HEK 293T cells were cotransfected with Nsp11-Myc and Flag-IKK. the results showed that Nsp11 could be coprecipitated with NEMO. the cells were fixed at 24 h posttransfection and stained with a rabbit anti-Myc MAb and a mouse anti-Flag antibody. the cells were stained with DAPI (blue) and were stained with DAPI (blue) the effects of OTULIN and Nsp11 on intracellular ubiquitin levels. the linear ubiquitination-specific deubiquitinase OTULIN had no effect on K48 or K63 polyubiquitination. previous studies have shown that PRRSV Nsp11 specifically removed K48 ubiquitination but had no effect on K63 ubiquitination. meanwhile, Nsp11 has no significant effect on linear ubiquitin chains. hek 293T cells were transfected with Flag-OTULIN or Nsp11-Myc. the mRNA levels of NF-B, IFN-, and IRF3 were detected by qRT-PCR. PRRSV Nsp11 and OTULIN downregulated the expression of NF-B. HEK 293T cells were transfected with Nsp11-Myc, Flag-OTULIN, or mutant. at 12 h posttransfection, cells were infected with SeV (MOI of 0.5) or left uninfected. after 24 h, infected cells were collected and expression levels of p65 in the nucleus or cytoplasm were analyzed by WB. the ubiquitin chain is linked by the amino group of ubiquitin methionine Met1 and the carboxyl group of another ubiquitin glycine. the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is important for the degradation of intracellular proteins in eukaryotic cell organisms. deubiquitination proteases may represent a unique protective mechanism established by the virus for long periods of confrontation with host innate immunity. in addition, early replication of the viruses depends on the nonstructural protein, which exhibits a large amount of enzyme activity. PRRSV Nsp11 targets IB to remove ubiquitination of K48, thereby inhibiting IFN- production. results imply that the related proteins play a role in the innate immunity of the host when the virus invades. the molecular mechanism by which PRRSV infection leads to the upregulation of OTULIN expression remains unclear. a stock of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV-JXwn06) with a titer of 104 PFU/ml was employed in this study. the primers used for PCR amplification are reverse transcriptase (TaKaRa). the primers used for PCR amplification are the primer name GenBank no.
