{"summary": "chicken astroviruses (CAstV) are known to cause mild gastroenteritis, growth depression, and even mortality in poultry, especially in chickens, turkeys, and ducks. there is no published information on CAstV in Grenada. five different astroviruses have been identified in avian species. in turkeys, two types of astroviurus (TAstV) have been identified. astroviurus causes severe outbreaks of gastroenteritis in turkeys. de Wit et al. [15] found 89% ANV and 4% chicken astroviruses (CAstV) in pigeons. a second species of astovirus, CAstV, was isolated from broiler chicks. blood from around 15 chickens from 2 to 3 farms in each parish was collected. sample preparation and detection of antibodies A volume of 2-3 ml blood sample was collected from the basilic vein (wing vein) of the chickens. sera were separated by centrifugation of blood at 3000 g for 10 min and frozen at 80\u00b0C until tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). the CAstV Group B antibody test kit from Biocheck (UK) Ltd. was used according to manufacturer\u2019s protocol. the prevalence of antibodies to CAstV varied in chicken flocks in various countries. Oluwayelu and Todd [19] reported 5.0% seroprevalence in parent flock, 28% in grandparent, and 21% in great grandparent chicken flocks in the UK. all chickens tested under this research looked healthy without any signs of growth retardation and enteritis. the only products completely effective at inactivation were 0.3% formaldehyde, 1.5% Virkon S, 0.1% b-propiolactone and 90% methanol. no research on astrovirus is going on in the Caribbean region. the presence of antibodies to CAstV in indigenous and commercial chickens indicates widespread infection with CAstV."}
