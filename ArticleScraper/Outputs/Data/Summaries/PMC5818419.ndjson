{"summary": "peste des petits ruminants (PPRV) is a severe infectious disease of goats and sheep. it was classified as a Morbillivirus under the family Paramyxoviridae and the order Mononegavirales. the life cycle of PPRV is 6\u20138 h in permissive cells. MeV enters vero cells that express SLAM and PVRL4 using a receptor-mediated macropinocytosis-like pathway. a recent study showed that SLAM can also mediate MeV endocytosis. most animal viruses enter host cells via endocytic pathways. simian hemorrhagic fever virus (Cai et al., 2015), egg drop syndrome virus (Huang et al., 2015) and Hantaan virus (Jin et al., 2002) previous studies indicated that HIV uses dynamin-dependent endocytosis during cell-to-cell transmission. caveolae-mediated endocytosis is the second most prevalent pathway used by Ebola virus, simian virus 40 and Japanese paramyxovirus PPRV enters caprine endometrial epithelial cells. the entry of PPRV into caprine endometrial epithelial cells may use endocytosis as an additional mechanism. we used a variety of chemical inhibitors and an RNA interference approach. a portion of the EECs were prone to aging and became larger and longer than primary cells with increased passage. a portion of the EECs were prone to aging and became larger and longer than primary cells. anti-clathrin monoclonal antibody and anti-nectin-4 monoclonal antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, United States) TRITC-phalloidin was purchased from Sigma. monolayers of EECs or FFCs grown in 24-well plates were pretreated with the respective inhibitors at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. cell viability upon drug treatment was determined by a cell viability assay. cells were then inoculated with PPRV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 at 4\u00b0C for 1 h. cells were then cultured in maintenance medium containing 2% serum at 37\u00b0C. transmission electron microscopy (TEM) Ultra-thin sections (70 nm) of cells were prepared and examined under a Hitachi HT-7700 transmission electron microscope (Hitachi High Technologies Co., Japan) Briefly, PPRV was inoculated into EECs cultured in a Cell Factory system (Nunc) at 5 days post-infection, cells and culture medium were harvested, subjected to three cycles of freeze-thawing. cell lysates were generated by adding 5 sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) sample buffer to the cells and boiling for 10 min. membranes were then blocked with 5% non-fat milk solution. cell lines and Viruses Endometrial epithelial cell were immortalized by transfection with human telomerase reverse transcriptase. the secretory function was consistent with that of primary EECs. a portion of the EECs were prone to aging and became larger and longer than primary cells with increased passage. a portion of the EECs were prone to aging and became larger and longer than primary cells. anti-clathrin monoclonal antibody and anti-nectin-4 monoclonal antibody were purchased from Abcam. TRITC-phalloidin was purchased from Sigma. pooled and validated siRNAs targeting caveolin-1 (Cav-1) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. monolayers of EECs or FFCs grown in 24-well plates were pretreated with the respective inhibitors at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. cells were then inoculated with PPRV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 at 4\u00b0C for 1 h. after adsorption, the medium was discarded and the cells were subsequently washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) HT-7700 transmission electron microscope was inoculated into EECs cultured in a Cell Factory system (Nunc) at 5 days post-infection, cells and culture medium were harvested, subjected to three cycles of freeze-thawing, and then centrifuged at 1500 g for 10 min. the supernatant was centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 120 min at 4\u00b0C in a SW41Ti rotor. cells were stained with TRITC-phalloidin (2 g/ml) for 40 min at 25\u00b0C. cells were treated with 1 g/ml of DAPI solution for 15 min at 25\u00b0C. 3D images were recorded using a leica TCS SP8 laser-scanning confocal microscope. titers were calculated using the Reed\u2013Muench method. each test was performed in triplicate. a value of P 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. PPRV appeared in the lower layer of the cell membrane over time. it was located on the cell membrane as indicated by an intense green signal in the 2D image. the viral titer increased rapidly from 3 hpi, peaking at 12 hpi. NH4Cl treatment at 25 mM and chloroquine treatment at 12.5 M did not affect cell viability. NH4Cl treatment before or after PPRV addition significantly blocked the entry and replication of PPRV (1.00 0.13, 0.51 0.12, 0.74 0.03 for mock, pre- and post-treatment samples, respectively) all tested inhibitors were subject to an MTT assay to evaluate their cytotoxicity toward EECs. cells were exposed to the indicated concentrations of inhibitors for 24 h. the bars indicate the mean SD from three independent experiments. sore treatment at 50 M did not affect cell viability (Figure 2C) dynasore treatment before PPRV inoculation significantly inhibited PPRV infection in EECs. however, dynasore treatment did induce the expression of green fluorescent signals specific to the PPRV-N and PPRV-H proteins on the cell membrane. CPZ treatment did not induce the expression of a green fluorescent signal specific to PPRV-H on the cell membrane when compared with control cells. the effect of CPZ on Alexa Fluor 594\u2013TF uptake was used as a positive control (red fluorescence) efficiency of CHC downregulation was analyzed by immunoblotting. bars indicate mean SD from three independent experiments. expression levels of CHC and PPRV-N were significantly downregulated. MCD treatment at 5 mM and nystatin treatment at 25 g/ml did not affect cell viability. these concentrations were chosen for the next set of experiments. nystatin treatment after virus addition significantly inhibited the entry and replication of PPRV. CLSM analysis of caveolin-1 (green), viral particles (red) and cell nuclei (blue) in PPRV-infected EECs pre-treated with MCD. effect of MCD on Alexa Fluor 594\u2013CTxB uptake was apparent (red) Western blot analysis of the entry of PPRV in mock-, MCD- or nystatin-treated cells. the expression levels of Cav-1 were significantly downregulated by specific siCav-1 (1.27 0.19, 0.38 0.13, for Scramble and siCav-1 samples, respectively, P 0.01). Virus titration analysis indicated that downregulation of Cav-1 expression significantly impaired PPRV replication and release. the bars indicate the mean SD from three independent experiments. PPRV entry does not depend on Macropinocytosis but Requires PI3K Macropinosome formation is dependent on Na+/H+ exchangers (NHE) wortmannin treatment significantly inhibited PPRV uptake. wortmannin treatment induced green fluorescent signals specific to the PPRV-N and PPRV-H proteins on the cell membrane. CLSM revealed significantly enhanced staining of nectin-4 on the cell surface of EECs. CPZ, MCD and EIPA treatment before and after virus addition did not noticeably affect PPRV N protein expression. dynasore treatment significantly inhibited the uptake of PPRV but not replication of the virus in FFCs. western blot analysis of viral receptor expression in mock and PPRV infected cells. bars indicate mean SD from three independent experiments. initial experiments were performed to analyze the uptake of PPRV into EECs. viral particles were internalized and distributed within the boundaries of the cells. 3D images showed that PPRV was adsorbed onto the cell surface but not inside the cells at 0 min. Western blot analysis of N protein expression to indicate virus replication in PPRV-infected EECs at the indicated time points post-infection. -actin was used as an internal control. the bars indicate the mean SD from three independent experiments. l-treated and chloroquine-treated cells showed inhibited PPRV entry and replication. a more intense green fluorescent signal specific to PPRV-N and PPRV-H was observed on the membrane of cells treated with NH4Cl and chloroquine compared with control cells. this results demonstrated that PPRV infection requires low pH conditions, but further investigation will be necessary to uncover the mechanism of action of NH4Cl on virus entry and replication. dynamin is required for the mediation of newly formed vesicles in the caveolin- and clathrin-dependent endocytic pathways. dynasore treatment at 50 M did not affect cell viability (Figure 2C) however, dynasore treatment before PPRV inoculation significantly inhibited PPRV infection in EECs. CPZ treatment did not induce the expression of a green fluorescent signal specific to PPRV-H on the cell membrane when compared with control cells. CPZ treatment effectively blocks the uptake of TF via the clathrin-medicated endocytosis pathway. -actin was used as an internal control. -actin was used as an internal control. -actin was used as an internal control. depletion of cholesterol from the membrane with MCD or sequestration of cholesterol with nystatin can significantly block caveolae-mediated endocytosis. in the present study, MCD treatment at 5 mM and nystatin treatment at 25 g/ml did not affect cell viability. MCD treatment induced green fluorescence signals specific to PPRV-N and PPRV-H on the cell membrane that were not evident in control cells. therefore, PPRV entry was obviously blocked in MCD and nystatin-treated cells. this data indicate that PPRV entry into cells depends on caveolae and requires the involvement of cholesterol. PPRV triggered plasma membrane invagination forming a cave-like structure wrapped around bound viruses at 30 min post infection. the vesicle then traveled to the cytoplasm after 1 hpi. to further confirm the role of Cav-1 in PPRV entry and replication, we detected the expression levels of Cav-1 by inhibiting Cav-1 expression with siRNA. western blot analysis of the entry of PPRV into siRNA-transfected cells. efficiency of caveolin downregulation was analyzed by immunoblotting. bars indicate mean SD from three independent experiments. required PI3K, EECs were treated with wortmannin, a specific PI3K inhibitor. Wortmannin treatment at 2.5 M did not affect cell viability. but significantly inhibited the productive infection of PPRV. lower basal levels of nectin-4 were detected in FFCs compared with EECs. CLSM revealed significantly enhanced staining of nectin-4 on the cell surface of EECs in response to PPRV infection. dynasore treatment significantly blocked PPRV entry (Figure 9I,J) cell viability was not significantly affected by these chemical inhibitors in FFCs. clathrin, caveolin, low pH, cholesterol, NHE and PI3K also play an essential role. all inhibitors were subjected to an MTT assay to evaluate their cytotoxicity toward FFCs that were exposed to the indicated concentrations for 24 h. the bars indicate the mean SD from three independent experiments. previous studies showed that paramyxoviruses enter into host cells via membrane fusion. however, Newcastle disease virus may enter cells by caveolae-mediated endocytosis, a process dependent on an acidic pH. SLAM plays an important role in facilitating the entry of morbilliviruses. in this study, we first showed that PPRV could utilize caveolin-mediated endocytic pathways to enter epithelial cells. acidic pH, dynamin, cholesterol and PI3K are critical for the entry process. an increasing number of enveloped viruses have been reported to take advantage of caveolae-mediated endocytosis. the levels of goat nectin-4 correlated well with PPRV infection in vitro. previous studies have shown that some viruses can actually enter host cells through a dynamin-dependent but not a clathrin- or caveolae-mediated endocytosis pathway. the internalization of paramyxovirus was reported to require an acidic pH. an endosomal low pH triggered a series of intracellular molecular events. exposure to an acidic pH appeared to be a requirement for successful entry and infection of EECs by PPRV. membrane cholesterol is a component of the lipid raft and plays important roles in the caveolin-mediated endocytic pathway. the depletion of cholesterol by treatment with MCD likely rearranged the phosphoinositide in the cell membrane, thereby blocking the binding domain for internalization. our data imply a close correlation between PPRV and various kinases. the precise mechanism remains to be elucidated. recent studies indicated that PPRV exploits the cellular autophagy machinery for replication."}
