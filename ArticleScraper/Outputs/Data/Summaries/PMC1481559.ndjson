{"summary": "mutant clouds represent the first stage in the genetic and antiviral diversification of RNA viruses, such as foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV), an important animal pathogen. a FMDV microarray was designed and optimized to detect simultaneously the seven FMDV serotypes. RNA viruses replicate with mutation rates in the range of 10-3 to 10-5 substitutions per nucleotide copied [2,3]. a transmission bottleneck may result in the establishment in the recipient host of one (or few) variant(s) sampled from the mutant cloud that replicates in the infected donor. the antigenic diversity of FMDV is reflected in the occurrence of seven serotypes (A, O, C, Asia1, SAT1, SAT2, SAT3), and multiple subtypes and variants that defy classification due to the continuous recognition of mutant forms. in vaccination-challenge experiments no cross-protection is observed among representatives of a different serotype. the overlap of residues involved in receptor recognition and antibody binding implies that variations at the G-H loop of VP1 can have consequences both for the antigenic behavior of the virus and its host range. studies in cell culture have shown that FMDV can evolve towards variants with altered RGD that display a remarkable expansion of host cell tropism [25]. mAb SD6 epitope sequence, the amino acid replacements found in individual biological FMDV clones isolated as mAb SD6-escape mutants, are indicated. the discontinuous line at the bottom indicates a double mutant. based in [11, 13, 44] and references therein. hybridization solutions including 50% formamide resulted in poor sensitivity. the unyhib solution (Arrayit) produced results comparable to those obtained with the hybridization solution described in Methods. the latter proved easier, more reproducible, efficient and yielded targets showing higher stability. temperatures between 48\u00b0C and 62\u00b0C were tested. the optimal point mutation discrimination was obtained between 58\u00b0C and 60\u00b0C. higher temperatures resulted in a progressive and significant loss of signal. controls were printed four times per slide. oligonucleotides were spotted in duplicate. each box in the grid includes the name of a oligonucleotide or negative controls. the labeled DNA was hybridized in the microarray, as described in Methods. five oligonucleotides were designed to identify the wild-type C-S8c1 sequence at the following positions. only the hybridization with S139 oligonucleotide produced a low signal. the results indicate a good discrimination between positive and negative signals as well as strong signals in the ICF probe and no signal in any of the negative controls. however, the hybridization pattern of a mutant includes specific negative and positive signals as well as crosshybridization signals. the hybridization pattern of a mutant includes specific negative and positive signals as well as crosshybridization signals. number of classified samples in 100 rounds of jack-knife is shown for each phenotype. the total number of samples in each class (#samples) is also given. 0.000 S144 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 RGV 0.069 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 RGV 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 RGV 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.996 0.000 0.000 S139I 0.005 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.005 0.003 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.068 0.002 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.927 The raw data corresponding to this paper are provided as additional files'[see Additional file1]' oligonucleotide attached at concentrations between 5 and 50 M was not limiting for detection of fluorescent DNAs. hybridization solutions including 50% formamide resulted in poor sensitivity. the unyhib solution (Arrayit) produced results comparable to those obtained with the hybridization solution described in Methods. a step-wise increase of hybridization temperatures, between 48\u00b0C and 62\u00b0C, was tested. low temperatures resulted in poor microarray performance due to high number of false positives. the optimal point mutation discrimination was obtained between 58\u00b0C and 60\u00b0C. the same pattern containing spots with 15-mers corresponding to the different queried and control mutants, and positive (ICF) and negative (HIV, nn) controls were printed four times per slide. oligonucleotides are distributed in 4 rows and 12 columns. RT-PCR products obtained with RNA from each of 16 mAb SD6-escape mutants of FMDV as template and primers 5'P-1R1L and pUL were labeled with lambda exonuclease. the labeled DNA was hybridized in the microarray, as described in Methods. the three mutants analyzed at positions 146 and 147 showed an adequate signal for specific identification, and no crosshybridization with other probes at the same position. the results indicate a good discrimination between positive and negative signals as well as strong signals in the ICF probe and no signal in any of the negative controls. however, the hybridization pattern of a mutant includes specific negative and positive signals as well as crosshybridization signals. average accuracy for each class (Av.class.acc.) is shown for each phenotype. the total number of samples in each class (#samples) is also given. 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 S144 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 RGV 0.069 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 RGV 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 RGV 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000 the microarray contained 155 oligonucleotide probes, of 35 to 45 residues from the VP3-VP1-2A-coding region of the FMDV genome. the microarray contained 155 oligonucleotide probes, of 35 to 45 residues from the VP3-VP1-2A-coding region of the FMDV genome. jack-knife simulations showed a high and stable degree of classification accuracy. 2 variants were misclassified in more than 5% of cases. despite this limitation in the reliable identification of some variants, the results illustrate the feasibility of a microarray approach. the application to discriminate among variants of FMDV is added to a number of microarray procedures used in virology. we have documented that DNA microarray technology can be used as a high-throughput method to analyze polymorphisms within a short region of the FMDV genome. the procedure is of general applicability as a test for specificity and discriminatory power of microarray-based diagnostic procedures using multiple probes. the bioinformatic procedure is of general applicability to fine genotyping, including studies of heterogeneous viral populations, genetic changes in virus, bacteria, and genes of rapidly evolving cells, such as tumoral cells. the bioinformatic procedure is of general applicability to fine genotyping. oligonucleotides were diluted in 1 spotting solution (Telechem-Arrayit) at 50 M final concentration. spots with spotting solution with no nucleotide were used as negative controls. RNA was reverse transcribed using avian myeloblastosis reverse transcriptase (RT) and pUL as primer (5'-GAGAAGAAGAAGGCCCAGGGTG-3'; antisense primer, complementary to positions 3873 to 3896 of the FMDV C-S8c1 genome) each of the RT-PCR products was analyzed by nucleotide sequencing using the Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Abi Prism, Perkin El the slides were washed for 2 min. at room temperature with 2X sodium saline citrate (SSC), 0.1% lauroylsarcosine, and for an additional 2 min. wash with 2 SSC at room temperature. the oligonucleotides were denatured by placing the slides 2 min. in distilled water, cooled 10 sec. at room temperature, and then the oligonucleotides were fixed by plunging the slides into ice- each probe was duplicated in the array. measures for the mean and median foreground intensity and for the mean and median background intensities were available. a Z-score of 7 provides optimal results. we added a probe for a fully conserved region of VP1 of the FMDV. in case one of the spots is discarded, we take Ma as the log2 of the remaining spot mean foreground intensity subtracted from its mean background intensity. we tried several normalization conditions as taking square root of the average spots mean intensities instead of the log2 or making a prior normalization by dividing each Ma by MICF. we analyzed 202 samples distributed among 17 phenotype classes to classify. we applied mcSVM to this problem, using a Gaussian kernel. each group, with 10% of the samples, was used as a test set. the remaining 90% was used as a training set. al antibody (mAb) SD6 recognizes amino acids 138 to 147 of VP1 [44]. the populations used to select mAb SD6-resistant mutants were derived from C-S8c1p100, in experiments designed to test duration of quasispecies memory. cleotides were diluted in 1 spotting solution (Telechem-Arrayit) at 50 M final concentration. microarrays containing 384 spots were printed by a GMS 417 DNA arrayer. each oligonucleotide was spotted in duplicate dots 150 m in diameter. each oligonucleotide was spotted in duplicate dots 150 m in diameter. the phosphorylated strand was specifically degraded using lambda exonuclease. the resulting single-stranded DNA was labeled with Alexa Fluor 647. the labeled DNA was used as target in the hybridization with probe oligonucleotides. the hybridization with the labeled DNA was carried out in hybridization buffer at the appropriate temperature (58\u201360\u00b0C) the slides were washed for 5 min. in 2 SSC, 0.1% lauroylsarcosine, followed by 5 min. in 2 SSC, and finally rinsed 10 sec. in 0.2 SSC, and 5 min. in distilled water, at 45\u00b0C. we used the additional measures available for the same probe. we calculated the Z-score in the usual way, subtracting the average from the mean foreground intensity and then dividing it by the standard deviation. if neither of the spots is discarded, we take as a measure for the presence of each mutant in the sample (Ma) the multiclass SVM is an extension of the classification problem to multiple classes, instead of just a binary classification. each sample was encoded by a 39 dimensional vector, each dimension corresponding to a variable computed in equation 1. VM and CP performed most of the experiments, have been involved in conception and design of the study. ED conceived and designed the study, had FMDV mutants to prepare the targets, drafted the manuscript, and revised it critically for important intellectual content. all authors read and approved the final manuscript."}
