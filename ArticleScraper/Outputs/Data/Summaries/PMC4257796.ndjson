{"summary": "the index case-patient was hospitalized on June 13, 2012, with a 7-day history of fever, cough, sputum expectoration, and shortness of breath. after an infectious disease consultation on day 2, airborne-transmission precautions were replaced with droplet-transmission precautions. after a multidrug-resistant organism was isolated on day 4, contact-transmission precautions were implemented (8). all specimens were tested by HKU5.2N nucleocapsid enzyme immunoassay (EIA) (9; incubations and substrate development were conducted at 37\u00b0C. 5 of 56 HCWs identified as having had contact with the MERS-CoV case-patient, 5 were unavailable for interview and 3 refused serum collection, leaving 48 for the final analysis. infection control precautions reportedly used by HCWs during contact with the case-patient included hand hygiene (100%) and/or wearing of gloves (94%), surgical mask (87%), and gown (40%) some admitted to 100% compliance and none used eye protection. respiratory symptoms were reported during June 15\u2013July 4 by 10 (21%) HCWs who had had case-patient contact. symptoms included cough (40%), sore throat (30%), myalgia (30%), rhinorrhea (20%), self-reported fever (10%), diarrhea (10%), and sneezing (10%) the assays used in this study have previously detected MERS-CoV\u2013specific antibodies 2 weeks and >13 months after illness onset with >97% specificity (9,14) no severely ill HCWs were identified during this investigation. timing of this investigation 4 months after hospitalization of the case-patient precluded use of real-time reverse transcription PCR."}
