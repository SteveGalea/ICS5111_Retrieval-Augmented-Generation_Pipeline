{"summary": "humans have five ifitm genes, including ifitm1, ifitm2, ifitm3, ifitm5, and ifitm10. they are all located on chromosome 11, with ifitm1, ifitm2, ifitm3, and ifitm5 clustered within a 26.5-kb region and ifitm10 located 1.4 Mb away. IFITM proteins restrict viral infection by interfering with virus entry (4). inhibition was observed for MLV pseudovirus bearing envelope proteins from influenza A virus, WNV, YFV, EBOV, and SARS-CoV. IFITM3 restriction of SARS-CoV S protein-mediated entry was bypassed when trypsin digestion was used to trigger the membrane fusion at or near the plasma membrane. ifitm3 knockout mice developed fulminant viral pneumonia when challenged with an otherwise-low-pathogenicity H3N2 influenza A virus. 5\u2032-CTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCT IFITM3 inhibits infection by VSV-G protein-pseudotyped viruses. the two transmembrane domains (TM1 and TM2) and the N-terminal sequence of IFITM3 are shown. GGAA, E314A, and E314Q mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. anti-Src (catalogue number NB110-57592), anti-Hck (catalogue number NB100-79963), anti-Lyn (catalogue number NB500-517), and anti-IFITM3 (mouse) antibodies from Abnova, anti-phosphotyrosine (pY) antibody from Abcam (catalogue genistein (catalogue number G6649), sodium orthovanadate, and a phosphatase inhibitor cocktail were purchased from Sigma. we also generated human embryonic kidney HEK293 stable cell lines using pQCXIP retroviral vectors that express IFITM3 and its various mutants. cells were lysed in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM Na3VO4 and protease inhibitors (Roche) after clarification by centrifugation, the lysates were incubated with anti-Flag M2 affinity agarose overnight at 4\u00b0C. lag (1:5,000), anti-pY (1:1,000), anti-Fyn (1:1,000), anti-Src (1:1,000), anti-Lyn (1:1,000), anti-Hck (1:1,000), and anti-IFITM3 (1:1,000) titer of viruses was determined by infecting HEK293 cells. infected cells were scored as GFP positive by flow cytometry. hek293 cells were transfected with pTet-IFITM3 or pTet-(1\u201321) together pTet-ON plasmid DNA. hek293 cells were seeded in a 4-chamber slide 1 day prior to transfection with pTet-IFITM3 or pTet-(1\u201321) together pTet-ON plasmid DNA clones. both IFITM3 and the (1\u201321) mutant had a Flag tag attached to their N termini. cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (in 1 phosphate-buffered saline) for 10 min at room temperature. cells were stained for 2 h with antibodies against Flag (1:500 dilution, mouse or rabbit), EEA1 (1:500 dilution, rabbit), CD63 (1:200 dilution, rabbit), TGN46 IFITM3 inhibits infection by VSV-G protein-pseu. it inhibits infection by VSV-G protein-pseu. the two transmembrane domains (TM1 and TM2) and the N-terminal sequence of IFITM3 are depicted. Western blotting to show the expression of IFITM3 and its mutants in stably transduced HEK293 cells. tubulin probed as an internal control. anti-Src (catalogue number NB110-57592), anti-Hck (catalogue number NB100-79963), anti-Lyn (catalogue number NB100-79963), anti-Lyn (catalogue number NB500-517) antibodies from Abnova, anti-phosphotyrosine (pY) antibody from Abcam (catalogue number ab10321), and anti-IFITM3 (rabbit) antibodies from ProteinTech. HEK293 cells were transfected with 2 g pQCXIP, 2 g pCMV-gag-pol-MLV, and 0.5 g pVSV-G. the retroviral particles were then used to infect HEK293 cells. expression of IFITM3 and its mutants was assessed by Western blotting. cells were lysed in a buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM Na3VO4 and protease inhibitors (Roche) after clarification by centrifugation, the lysates were incubated with anti-Flag M2 affinity agarose overnight at 4\u00b0C. titer of viruses was determined by infecting HEK293 cells. infected cells were scored as GFP positive by flow cytometry. virus amounts were then determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. HEK293 cells were seeded in a 4-chamber slide 1 day prior to transfection with pTet-IFITM3 or pTet-(1\u201321) together pTet-ON plasmid DNA clones. expression of the mutant was induced by doxycycline (500). both IFITM3 and the (1\u201321) mutant had a Flag tag attached to their N termini. cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (in 1 phosphate-buffered saline) for 10 min at room temperature. cells were stained for 2 h with antibodies against Flag (1:500 dilution, mouse or rabbit), EEA1 (1:500 dilution, rabbit), CD63 (1:200 dilution, rabbit), TGN46 the virus infection rate of the control cell line (named pQCXIP) was arbitrarily set as 1. the results showed that IFITM3 reduced the infection by 2-fold. the mutant exhibited no effect (Fig. 1C and D) all mutants were expressed at levels similar to that of wild-type IFITM3. the Y20, (17\u201320) and 17PTAP mutants exhibited slower mobility. this may have resulted from alterations in protein local conformation or in SDS-binding capacity due to the mutations inserted. 17PTAP or 17YPDL did not preserve the antiviral activity of IFITM3. we also observed that the K24R mutant inhibited virus infection no less than wild-type IFITM3. expression of IFITM3 and its mutants was induced by doxycycline (Fig. 3A) virus showed similar replication profiles in different cell lines. induction of IFITM3 expression by doxycycline markedly suppressed HIV-1 replication. IFITM3 and (1\u201321) mutant inhibits virus entry mediated by the HIV-1 envelope protein but not the VSV-G envelope protein. transfections were performed with pCMV-BlaM-Vpr, pVSV-G, and NLENY1-ES-IRES DNA. the N-terminal region of IFITM3 is required for inhibiting HIV-1 envelope-mediated virus entry. the mutant was mostly seen at the cell periphery and barely exhibited colocalization with endocytosed transferrin molecules. the 21-amino-acid deletion causes a relocation of IFITM3 from the endocytic compartments. IFITM3 and (1\u201321) mutant DNAs were transfected into HEK293 cells. their expression was detected by immunostaining with anti-Flag antibodies. locations of EEA1, CD63, and TGN46 were visualized by immunostaining. the Y20 and (17-20) mutants were seen at the cell periphery and barely exhibited colocalization with the late endosome marker CD63. together, these data suggest that the N-terminal region of IFITM3 regulates IFITM3 cellular location and thus determine the inhibition of pH-dependent viruses. only IFITM3, not IFITM1 or IFITM2, was recognized by pY antibodies. only the tyrosines of IFITM3 are phosphorylated at Y20. the endogenous IFITM3 was precipitated using the anti-iFITM3 antibody. the anti-pY antibody recognized the Y80A, Y99A, and Y132A mutants but not the Y20 mutant. the results showed that neither of these mutants was recognized by the anti-pY antibody. the 17YPDL mutant has a tyrosine at position 17 but was not phosphorylated. the tyrosine kinase Fyn phosphorylates IFITM3. we first tested the effect of tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein, PP2 and U0126 on IFITM3 phosphorylation. siRNA used siRNA to knock down endogenous Fyn in HEK293T cells. siFyn1 was the most effective in both depleting endogenous Fyn and diminishing IFITM3 phosphorylation. ectopically expressed mutants compete with the endogenous Fyn for binding to IFITM3. HEK293T cells were transfected with siRNA oligonucleotides targeting Fyn and IFITM3 mRNAs. wild-type IFITM3 or its Y20 mutants were transiently expressed in HEK293T cells that had also been transfected with IFITM3 plasmid DNA. IFITM3 mutated at tyrosine residue 20 (Y20) does not inhibit VSV-G protein-mediated virus infection. it was previously reported that deleting the first 21 amino acids renders IFITM3 unable to inhibit VSV. to test this hypothesis, we generated three mutations, (17\u201320), 1718, and Y20. we also mutated K24 to R, as K24 is the lysine residue closest to PPNY. in addition to PPxY, there are two other viral late domains, P(T/S)AP and YPxL. the 1718 and Y20 mutants were expressed at levels similar to that of wild-type IFITM3. deletion of the Y20 residue, but not 17-PP-18, abrogated the antiviral activity of IFITM3. Y20 itself, independent of the PPNY motif, enables IFITM3 to inhibit VSV-G protein-mediated virus infection. the infection efficiency of the control cells is arbitrarily set as 1. The IFITM3 (1\u201321) mutant profoundly suppresses HIV-1 replication. we then asked whether the N-terminal region of IFITM3 is required for inhibiting other viruses, such as HIV-1. IFITM3 and its N-terminal mutants suppress HIV-1 replication. expression of IFITM3 was induced by doxycycline (Dox) and examined by Western blotting. the viruses were concentrated by ultracentrifugation, quantified by HIV-1 p24 ELISA, and then used to infect SupT1 cells expressing wild-type IFITM3 or the (1\u201321) mutant. the results showed that IFITM3 and its (1\u201321) mutant markedly decreased the entry of BH10/BlaM-Vpr viruses into target cells. FITM3 (1\u201321) mutant inhibits HIV-1 envelope-mediated virus entry. mutant was mostly seen at the cell periphery and barely exhibited colocalization with endocytosed transferrin molecules. this suggests that the 21-amino-acid deletion causes a relocation of IFITM3 from the endocytic compartment. the locations of EEA1, CD63, and TGN46 were visualized by immunostaining with respective antibodies (pseudocolored in red) we then further characterized the cellular location of IFITM3 through immunostaining for EEA1, CD63, and TGN46. this suggests that IFITM3 is mainly located at the early and late endosomes. we included IFITM1 and IFITM2 in the assays to detect tyrosine phosphorylation. we first expressed IFITM1, -2, and -3 proteins in HEK293T cells. the endogenous IFITM3 was precipitated and subject to western blotting with anti-pY antibody. phosphorylation of wild-type IFITM3 and theY20, Y80A, Y99A, and Y132A mutants. the anti-pY antibodies recognized the Y80A, Y99A, and Y132A mutants but not the Y20 mutant. the results showed that neither of these two mutants was recognized by the anti-pY antibody. together, these data suggest that Y20 is the major tyrosine phosphorylation site in IFITM3. we then performed immunoprecipitation experiments to determine which Src kinases interact with IFITM3. a measurable association of Fyn with IFITM3 was detected. rat IFITM3/Rat8 is associated with Fyn (42) ectopically expressed Fyn mutants compete with the endogenous Fyn for binding to IFITM3 and, as a result, diminish IFITM3 phosphorylation. these data suggest that Fyn, which is also membrane associated (2), phosphorylates IFITM3. IFITM3, wild-type Fyn, and Fyn mutants were detected with anti-Flag antibody (pseudocolored in green) representative images are shown. mutagenesis studies reveal Y20 as the key residue that determines IFITM3 localization in cells. in order to inhibit both pH-dependent and pH-independent viruses, IFITM3 is expected to be present at the cellular compartments where these different viruses complete their entry. the localization of IFITM3 to endosomes depends on the Y20 amino acid. CTKA-4 has a YVKM sequence that can be phosphorylated at the Y residue when a T cell is activated. the phosphorylated IFITM3 represents a minor fraction of the total IFITM3 in cells. it is possible that the extent of Y20 phosphorylation affects IFITM3 distribution in different cellular membrane compartments. the topology of IFITM3 on membranes has been described in two models. one predicts that IFITM3 passes the membrane twice with its N and C termini present within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum or extracellular. if this is the sole topology of IFITM3 on cell membranes, then Y20 would not have access to Fyn that is located at the cytoplasmic face of the cellular membranes. Y20 likely functions as a key residue of a putative sorting signal, 20-YEML-23, that resides within the N-terminal region of IFITM3. y20 is dispensable for inhibiting HIV-1, which enters cells in a pH-independent fashion."}
