{"summary": "influenza A viruses are included in the Orthomyxoviridae family of negative single-stranded, segmented RNA viruses. they cause an infectious disease that constitutes an important public health problem and remains today an important cause of morbidity and mortality. many viruses utilize host shutoff mechanisms that eliminate competition from cellular transcripts. previous research suggested that influenza mRNAs are preferably translated due to features found in the 5\u2019UTR of viral mRNAs. the 5\u2019 m7G caps on viral transcripts are acquired by \u201ccap-snatching\u201d (Plotch et al., 1981), this snatching allows the priming of viral mRNA synthesis but also leads to nascent host transcripts degradation. we have used RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and ribosome profiling (deep sequencing of ribosomes-protected fragments) to map the changes in host genes RNA and translation levels during IAV infection. we found that host transcripts are affected differently by IAV infection and that the extent of mRNAs reduction is related to their length and GC content. both the mRNA and footprints read density measurements were reproducible. ribosome density accumulates along the gene body ending at the first in-frame stop codon with pronounced accumulation of ribosomes at the initiation and termination sites. AV minus strand were not affected by harringtonine treatment. ribosome profiles reflect ribosome-protected fragments from host and viral mRNAs. average ribosome read density profiles from IAV minus strand aligned to highest peak found in each viral minus strand segment. data from cycloheximide (CHX) or harringtonine (Harr) pre-treatment from 8 hpi samples. IAV mRNAs scored well in these matrixes and did not differ from well-expressed human transcripts. however, reads from IAV minus strand could be clearly distinguished from annotated coding sequences. this possibility is supported by the observation that the numbers of protected reads originating from the IAV genome increases as the infection progresses. -X endonuclease activity plays a dominant role in host shutoff during IAV infection. -X endonuclease activity plays a dominant role in host shutoff during IAV infection. mRNA levels are driving the reduction in host protein synthesis. we monitored protein synthesis in IAV infected A549 cells by metabolic labelling. also in our system IAV infection produced abundant quantities of virus polypeptides from 4 hpi. this was followed by reduced cellular protein synthesis. cluster 1 is composed of mRNAs that are most drastically downregulated. cluster 1 is enriched with genes related to DNA repair and cell cycle. cellular mRNAs that are barely affected by IAV infection (cluster 3) are enriched with genes related to oxidative phosphorylation and for transcripts encoding ribosomal proteins. mRNAs in polysome-free fractions of the gradient (F), light polysomal fractions (L) and heavy polysomal fractions (H) of uninfected and IAV infected cells at 4 hpi. eIF2 phosphorylation is a stress response that reduces overall protein synthesis while enhancing the translation of specific transcripts. smFISH measurements validate the RNA-seq quantification and reveal that cellular mRNA down regulation occurs in the nucleus. we quantified the expression of four human mRNAs, two mRNAs that are significantly reduced during influenza infection (CHML and KIF18A, cluster 1) and two mRNAs that were less affected by infection. smFISH measurments of cellular mRNAs along IAV infection were performed on A549 cells, either mock infected or 8 hpi. DNA oligomer probes coupled with fluorescent dyes were targeted against viral hemagglutinin (HA), human MYC. mRNAs per cell from at least 45 cells were quantified using smFISH. p-values are derived from a Student's t-test, *p0.05. transcripts composing the clusters presented in Fig. 3C were compared. multiple mechanisms for IAV interference with cellular RNA expression have been described. the discovery of the highly conserved RNA endonuclease, PA-X, implied for the existence of cytoplasmic degradation machinery. however, recent work presented evidence that PA-X activity might be restricted to the nucleus. the decline in mRNA levels should be correlated with the cytoplasmic half-lives of mRNAs with long half-lives in cluster 3. this includes genes that were only mildly affected by IAV infection (Figure 5D, Pval = 0.005) this cluster contained also many genes with short half-life. transcripts coding for ribosomal and oxidative phosphorylation proteins are less reduced following IAV infection. this suggests that translation maintenance of these cellular pathways might be important for IAV infection. we tested whether continuous oxidative phosphorylation is important for IAV propagation by employing drugs that interfere with the function of the respiratory chain. mRNAs involved in oxidative phosphorylation are less perturbed by IAV infection. maintenance of intact oxidative phosphorylation activity during IAV infection is important for viral replication. CCCP (untreated, 10 M or 20 M) or Valinomycin (untreated, 1 M, 2.5 M) we infected A549 cells with the A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 H1N1 strain at MOI = 5 and harvested cells at 2, 4, and 8 hr post infection (hpi). both the mRNA and footprints read density measurements were reproducible. the footprints we obtained from viral mRNAs originate from ribosome protected fragments of transcripts that were engaged in active translation elongation. the protected fragments that mapped to the IAV minus strand were not affected by harringtonine treatment. average ribosome read density profiles from IAV minus strand aligned to the highest peak found in each viral minus strand segment. data from uninfected, 2, 4 and 8 hpi samples, and harringtonine pretreated 8 hpi sample. data from the plus strand (dark blue) and the minus strand (light blue) is presented. we applied a recently developed metric that distinguishes between 80S footprints and non-ribosomal sources using footprint size distributions. the overall size distribution of fragments derived from protein-coding sequences differs from the lengths of contaminating fragments found in profiling samples. the similarity improved with increasing read counts. TE is defined as the ratio of footprints to total mRNAs for a given gene. we then compared the TE of human genes to that of viral genes at each of the time points along infection. mRNAs take over 53.8% of the translation activity in the cells as 57.3% of the mRNAs in the cells are viral. bosome footprints and mRNA read densities were calculated relative to expression of uninfected cells. four main clusters are marked and for each of these clusters the pathway enrichment is labeled on the left. a representative analysis of two independent experiments is shown. this approach allowed clustering of the cellular transcripts into 4 distinct classes based on similarities in temporal expression profiles in the RNA-seq and ribosome profiling data. changes in ribosome footprints tracked the changes in transcripts abundance. this is in line with host protein synthesis shutoff being driven by the in reduction cellular RNA levels and not by direct interference with the translation machinery. these measurements provide relative but not absolute quantification of RNA and translation levels along IAV infection. we also extracted RNA from an equal number of cells along infection and performed real-time PCR analysis for cellular mRNAs from each of these clusters. these independent measurements were in strong agreement with our RNA-seq measurements. 125 genes were translationally upregulated whereas 85 genes were translationally down regulated. eIF2 phosphorylation is a stress response that reduces protein synthesis. eIF2 phosphorylation is a stress response that reduces overall protein synthesis. smFISH technique enables visualization of single mRNA molecules in fixed cells. it relies on hybridization of short DNA libraries that are coupled to a fluorophore and are complementary to a specific target mRNA sequence. this method has been used in various systems allowing accurate quantification of mRNA molecules per cell. smFISH measurments of cellular mRNAs along IAV infection strongly support the notion that host shutoff is mainly driven by differences in mRNA levels. smFISH measurments of cellular mRNAs along IAV infection were performed on A549 cells, either mock infected or 8 hpi. mRNA half-lives measurements in A549 cells (33) (E) Transcripts length distribution. poly-A tail length of host transcripts as previously measured from HeLa and NIH3T3 cells were compared between transcripts composing clusters presented in Figure 3C. mFISH also provides spatial information about mRNA molecule distribution in the cell. this allowed us to test the levels of endogenous cellular transcripts in the nucleus and cytoplasm along influenza infection. the nuclear and cytoplasmic levels of CHML, KIF18A and MYC were downregulated to the same extent. the length of the poly-A tail affects the extent to which mRNAs are reduced after IAV infection. the transcripts that were less affected by IAV were significantly shorter and had higher GC content. the transcripts that were less affected by IAV were significantly shorter and had higher GC content. western blot analysis of cell extracts along IAV infection suggests translation maintenance of these cellular pathways might be important for IAV infection. mRNAs involved in oxidative phosphorylation are less perturbed by IAV infection, and maintenance of intact oxidative phosphorylation activity is important for viral replication. representative blot of three independent experiments shown. TMRM staining for active mitochondria in A549 cells mocked, untreated, infected for 12 and 24 hr. a representative analysis of two independent experiments is shown. our systematic and unbiased analysis surprisingly demonstrates that viral mRNAs are not preferentially translated compared to their host counterparts. at 8 hpi there is already extensive viral replication (evident from the strong increase in reads originating from the viral minus strand) previous studies demonstrated inhibition of eIF2a phosphorylation during influenza infection. this inhibition is mediated by the activation of the cellular inhibitor of PKR, P58-IPK. this stress response affects the expression of cellular genes. magnitude of reduction could only be partially explained by cytoplasmic half-life. the extent of reduction was significantly correlated with transcript\u2019s length and GC content. however, it is likely that the majority of observed differential reduction in cellular mRNAs is driven by PA-X degradation activity. transcripts that are less affected by IAV infection are enriched for genes involved in pathways that the virus potentially depends on. the levels of mitochondrial proteins are not affected by IAV even at 16 hpi, a time point in which other proteins were reduced. ribosome profiling is an emerging technique that allows probing of translation systematically and with increased sensitivity. this method in conjunction with RNA-seq was previously used to map the changes that occur in host gene expression during herpes simplex virus and cytomegalovirus infections. unbiased and systematic quantification methods can advance our understanding of viral interference with host protein production.
