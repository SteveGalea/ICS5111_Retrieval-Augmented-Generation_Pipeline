{"summary": "fitch ferret presented for necropsy after a 1-wk history of greenish diarrhea progressing to hematochezia. the ferret was singly housed in a modified rabbit cage within a cubicle containing several other singly housed ferrets. no other ferrets displayed any signs of clinical illness. observations included an empty gastrointestinal tract with a focal gastric ulcer; hyperemia and segmental thickening of the jejunum, ileum, and rectum; enlarged nodular mesenteric lymph nodes; splenomegaly with multiple tan nodular masses; and left ventricular dilatation. a diagnosis of a systemic coronaviral disease was made. a 7-mo-old female ferret presented to a veterinary private practice with a 3-wk history of decreased appetite and bruxism. the ferret had contact with 2 other ferrets and multiple other species. a serum chemistry panel revealed hypoalbuminemia, and laparoscopy revealed nodular, white foci on the majority of abdominal organs and mesentery. the ferret was euthanized, and tissues in formalin were submitted for further diagnostic evaluation. spleen was enlarged, with multiple, raised, coalescing tan nodules extending from the surface into the parenchyma. mesenteric lymph node displaying severe multifocal to coalescing necrogranulomatous lymphadenitis. immunohistochemistry showed positive (brown) staining for feline coronavirus. a 6-mo-old male ferret was initially diagnosed with ferret granulomatous coronavirus-associated disease. us inflammation with reactive fibrosis and multifocal regions of necrosis and fibrin deposition were not identified. immunohistochemical staining at a diagnostic referral laboratory confirmed the presence of coronavirus antigen in inflammatory foci. multiple, coalescing, raised white nodules in the lungs with complete consolidation of the accessory lobe (Figure 3 F), and splenomegaly with pinpoint, pitted lesions (Figure 3 G). multisystemic granulomatous to pyogranulomatous inflammation either in the form of discrete or coalescing foci prominently involving the mesenteric nodes (Figure 4 A), lungs, pancreas, intestinal serosa, and peritoneum a 10-mo-old female ferret presented to a private veterinary practice with a history of weight loss, lethargy, and green mucoid diarrhea of unknown duration. a 10-mo-old female ferret presented to a private veterinary practice with a history of weight loss, lethargy, and green mucoid diarrhea of unknown duration. a serum chemistry panel revealed hypoproteinemia and hypoalbuminemia. the ferret was euthanized and a necropsy performed by the referring veterinarian. the ferret was housed alone in a modified rabbit cage within a room. abdominal radiographs revealed splenomegaly and an area of increased opacity in the cranial midabdomen. splenomegaly and a focal, irregular, 5 cm 4 cm, nodular mesenteric mass firmly adhered to the small intestine. the architecture of the mesentery, mesenteric lymph node, small intestine, and liver was disrupted and effaced by moderate multifocal to coalescing pyogranulomatous inflammation. the necrotic core was composed of cellular and karyorrhectic debris admixed with degenerate neutrophils. the blood and lymphatic vessels in the mesentery and lymph node were ectatic and contained moderate amounts of ferret showed rapid progression of weakness, lethargy, inappetance, and eventual anorexia. a 200-g decrease in body weight over a 1-wk period. supportive care including subcutaneous fluids was ineffective. small numbers of epithelioid macrophages were present in a few perivascular foci within the meninges of the brain. Ziehl\u2013Neelsen acid-fast and periodic acid\u2013Schiff staining revealed no mycobacteria or fungal organisms, respectively, in the lesions. the leptomeninges of the cerebral cortex are expanded by perivascular aggregates of lymphocytes and macrophages (bar, 100 M) the leptomeninges of the cerebral cortex are expanded by perivascular aggregates of lymphocytes and macrophages (bar, 100 M). hematoxylin and eosin stain (B through E) the liver exhibited a 3-cm irregular, nodular, tan mass along the lateral edge of the left lobe, with a few small, tan foci on all other lobes. the mesentery contained multiple, tan to yellow nodules throughout and was thickened along vessels. gastric and mesenteric lymph nodes were enlarged and adherent to adjacent tissues. a 6-mo-old, castrated male ferret was initially diagnosed with ferret granulomatous coronavirus-associated disease at a veterinary private practice. clinical findings at that time included diarrhea, lethargy, anorexia, and a palpable abdominal mass. abdominal radiographs revealed a poorly defined area of increased opacity in the midabdomen apparent. an abdominal ultrasound 5 wk after initial diagnosis revealed a multilobular midabdominal mass 2.7 cm in diameter. serial bloodwork revealed progressive hypoalbuminemia, hyperglobulinemia, hypokalemia, and intermittent anemia and neutrophilic leukocytosis. cortical lymphoplasmacytic interstitial nephritis and chronic sclerotic glomerulopathy. periodic acid\u2013Schiff and Gomori methenamine silver stains of lung tissue were negative for fungal organisms. a Ziehl\u2013Neelsen acid fast stain of lung, mesenteric lymph node, stomach and intestine was negative for acid-fast bacilli. a 10-mo-old female ferret presented to a private veterinary practice with a history of weight loss, lethargy, and green mucoid diarrhea of unknown duration. a small trichobezoar in the stomach and a firm, irregular midabdominal mass were performed by the referring veterinarian. an adult, male, laboratory-housed ferret presented with clinical signs of intermittent depression, lethargy, inappetence, and 100-g weight loss over 4.5 mo. a markedly enlarged spleen and a midabdominal mass were palpable on physical exam. nodular mesenteric mass firmly adhered to the small intestine. pyogranulomatous inflammation disrupts and effaces mesentery and small intestine. inflammation is composed of minimal number of degenerate neutrophils. necrotic core was surrounded by an inner zone of epithelioid macrophages and an outer zone of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and few fibroblasts. the blood and lymphatic vessels in the mesentery and lymph node were ectatic and contained moderate amounts of eosinophilic material. the hepatic periportal interstitium and the perivascular interstitium of the mesentery were surrounded by low to moderate numbers differential diagnoses for the 5 cases we presented include mycobacteriosis and systemic fungal infections. no acid-fast bacilli or fungal organisms were identified. the distribution and nature of the lesions mimic those seen with chronic Aleutian disease. the route for transmission of the disease is unknown but is suggested to be fecal\u2013oral, similar to that for FCoV. measures aimed at preventing the spread of the disease should be adapted from recommendations for the prevention of feline infectious peritonitis."}
