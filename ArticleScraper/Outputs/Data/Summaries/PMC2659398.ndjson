{"summary": "the development of plant virus vectors as in planta expression systems for foreign genes provides an attractive alternative biotechnological approach for peptide expression. the method has been exploited in vaccine production, where small foreign peptides are expressed as a fusion with the viral coat proteins. essentially, an insertion site has to be determined in the virus genome so that the resulting product will be displayed on the surface of the virus particle. the study was used to challenge the size limits of foreign gene insertion into the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) used was only 33 amino acids. the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) used was only 33 amino acids. PCR amplification using primer pairs 1\u20139, 3\u20139, and 2\u20137 will yield amplified products of approximately 6.5 kb, 0.85 kb, and 2.2 kb respectively. forward RT (5\u2032-CCAAGCTTGCCAATAGCAATTAATCATAGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG in vitro transcription was carried out using the (Ambion, Calif, USA) high Yield Capped T7 RNA Transcription Kit according to the manufacturer protocol. traces of DNA template of the transcription reactions were detected since no DNase I treatment was done. RT-PCR Detection of Chimeric Virus Infection Total RNA was isolated from the new leaf of the healthy plants using RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN) RT-PCR was performed using AccuPower RT/PCR PreMix (Bioneer, Daejeon, South Korea) with primers CGMMV 3\u2032UTR (5\u2032-TGGGCCCCTACCAGAGAAGATCTGCAGGAATT-3\u2032) the precipitated virus was separated from the solution through centrifugation at 10 000 g for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0C. any undissolved material was cleared by centrifugation at 10 000 g for 30 minutes at 12\u00b0C. the pellet was then reconstituted in 100 L of distilled water and stored at 4\u00b0C until used. the digested PCR products and the linearized pCGT7X were purified following 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. they were then ligated to form pRT, pRG, both containing the TMV read-through sequence [12] and pCG+FSRTRE (containing the CGMMV read-through sequence) [13], respectively. in vitro transcription reactions were synthesized through long-distance PCR (LD-PCR) in 50 L PCR cocktails containing 1X HF Buffer of Phusion DNA Polymerase (Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland) the reaction was set up in 0.2 mL tubes, and the thermal cycling was conducted with initial denaturation. in vitro-synthesized transcripts were denatured and electrophoresed alongside RNA markers showing its integrity and the expected transcript size of approximately 6.5 kb. plants used in this study were maintained in a growth room at 25\u00b0C with 16 hours of light and 8 hours of darkness. amplified product of approximately 2.2 kb (with PstI sense and CGMMV 3\u2032UTR primers) or 0.85 kb (with C5500F and CGMMV 3\u2032UTR primers) infected plants showed typical symptoms were harvested, weighed, and homogenized in ice-cold 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.0 containing 1% of -mercaptoethanol) chimeric clones pRT, pRG, and pCG-FSRTRE were constructed by inserting the EB4 coding sequence to the end of the CGMMV CP ORF in plasmid pCGT7X. the genome size of wild-type CGMMV is approximately 6.4 kb. the templates for in vitro transcription of these two clones were generated through LD-PCR. the resulting amplified products consisted of a T7 promoter fused with the chimeric CGMMV genome carrying EB4. the resulting amplified products (6.5 kb) consisted of a T7 promoter fused with the chimeric CGMMV genome carrying EB4. virus particles were extracted from the infected plants. an aliquot was electrophoretically separated on 15% SDS-PAGE. the ratio of modified to unmodified CP was approximately 1:1. the chimeric virus consisted of two different CP species. the ratio of modified to unmodified CP was approximately 1:1. pI:charge value can affect epitope presentation.

EB4 was totally undetectable at 30 dpi. the 5\u2032 end of introduced read-through sequence of AAA-TAG-CAA-TTA was retained within the genome for all sequenced clones. the introduced site from position 742 to 747 was deleted for clones pR_P3U1, pR_P3U3, pR_P3U4 and pR_P3U11 after 30 dpi. the EB4 was not detectable at 30 dpi, and only present in some ( 50% tested) plants at 21 dpi. these findings strongly suggest that deletion had occurred within the host plants after 14 dpi. chimeric clone pCG+FSRTRE was constructed carrying read-through sequence (AAA-UAG-CAA-UUA) from the wild-type CGMMV genome. it is postulated that there is a read-through signal preference between different species of tobamoviruses, in this case between TMV and CGMMV causing possibly viral particle assembly failure. the order of the removal of the transgene was speculated to be the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction. this is further supported by the detection of two additional nucleotides. this is further supported by the detection of two additional nucleotides. this is further supported by the detection of two additional nucleotides. harvesting time would be 14 dpi or not more than 20 dpi to obtain maximum yield of full-length transgene. growth of plants for longer periods may induce unwanted transgene deletions."}
