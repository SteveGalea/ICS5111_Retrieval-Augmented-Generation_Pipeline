{"summary": "the estimated global annual production of TiO2NPs is currently near 12,500 tons (1,2) this value is expected to reach 2.5 million metric tons by 2025 (3). exposure to TiO2NPs via inhalation leads to pulmonary inflammation, emphysema and lung injury in experimental rodents. mice exposed individually to six different types of TiO2NPs. acute, subchronic and chronic post-exposure time points were included. samples were collected at 1, 28 and 90 days post-exposure. anatase TiO2NPs of three different sizes, 8, 20 and 300nm (aTiO28, aTiO220 and aTiO2300), mixed anatase and rutile TiO2NPs of 20nm (raTiO220) and rutile TiO2NPs of 20nm with hydrophilic [rTiO220 (HY)] or hydrophobic [rTiO220 (HP hydrophobic rTiO220 (HY) and rTiO220 (HP) are used in skin and sun care products. the hydrophobic rTiO220 (HY) is also used in manufacturing waterproof and stain resistant textiles. the results revealed that with the exception of raTiO220, all other TiO2NPs are best dispersed in MilliQ water. for the purposes of consistency, the raTiO220 was also prepared in MilliQ water. a stock suspension of 6mL for each type of TiO2NPs at a concentration of 12.15mg/mL was made in MilliQ water. samples were mixed and diluted 1 in 100 with 0.22 m-filtered MilliQ water. they were sonicated again for 5min in a water bath sonicator. all mice were housed in autoclaved cages with 12-h light\u2013dark cycle. mice received intratracheal instillation of 18 g (very low), 54 g (low dose), 162 g (medium dose) or 486 g (high dose) of TiO2NPs in a 40-L suspension prepared as described above, followed by 150 l air with a 250 L SGE glass syringe. mice were kept under observation until they recovered from anaesthesia. a total of 500 cells were counted per cytospin to identify mononuclear cells, neutrophils and lymphocytes using an optical microscope (Olympus BH2, Olympus Optical Company Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) a non-parametric one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a post-hoc Tukey-type test (28) was conducted to examine the effect of doses compared with the matched control. lglucosaminidase activity assay Commercially available -N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG) activity colorimetric assay kit (Biovision, CA, USA) was used according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. 125 L standard synthetic p-nitrophenol derivative (pNP) or BALF were incubated for 30min at 37\u00b0C in the presence of NAG substrate. Embedded samples were ultrathin-sectioned on a leica EM UC6 ultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems, Ultrastain-1, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA) total RNA extraction and purification Total RNA was isolated from random sections of the left lung lobe. cRNAs from experimental (control and control groups) were labelled with cyanine 5-CTP. reference cRNAs were labelled with cyanine 3-CTP using a T7 RNA polymerase in vitro transcription kit. an equimolar amount of reference cRNA was mixed with each experimental cRNA sample. the false discovery rate (FDR) multiple testing correction (35) was applied. Genes showing expression changes of at least 1.5-fold in either direction compared with their matched controls were considered as significantly differentially expressed genes. a set of six TiO2NPs of varying physico-chemical properties were investigated in the current study. anatase TiO2NPs of three different sizes, 8, 20 and 300nm (aTiO28, aTiO220 and aTiO2300), mixed anatase and rutile TiO2NPs of 20nm (raTiO220) and rutile TiO2NPs of 20nm the hydrophobic rTiO220 (HY) and rTiO220 (HP) are used in skin and sun care products. the hydrophobic rTiO220 (HY) is also used in manufacturing waterproof and stain resistant textiles. aTiO220 and aTiO2300 have not been reported. a pilot study was conducted to assess the dispersion of TiO2NPs. the results revealed that with the exception of raTiO220, all other TiO2NPs are best dispersed in MilliQ water. samples were manually mixed and diluted 1 in 100 with 0.22 m-filtered MilliQ water. samples were then sonicated again for 5min in a water bath sonicator. all mice were housed in autoclaved cages with 12-h light\u2013dark cycle. mice received a single intratracheal instillation of 18 g (very low), 54 g (low dose), 162 g (medium dose) or 486 g (high dose) of TiO2NPs in a 40-L suspension. mice were kept under observation until they recovered from anaesthesia. a total of 2mL of 0.9% sterile saline was injected in lungs and was recovered. a total of 2mL of 0.9% sterile saline was injected in lungs. a total of 500 cells were counted per cytospin to identify mononuclear cells, neutrophils and lymphocytes. 125 L standard synthetic p-nitrophenol derivative (pNP) or BALF were incubated for 30min at 37\u00b0C in the presence of NAG substrate. the release of pNP was determined by measuring the absorbance at 400nm. metric one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a post-hoc Tukey-type test (28) was conducted to examine the effect of particle and dose for the three post-exposure time points. data were analysed using the R statistical computing environment (29) 120 L BALF or standard ALP enzymes were incubated with 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate disodium salt (MUP) for 30min at room temperature, when the reaction was terminated by adding a stop solution. the fixed lung tissue samples were cut into small pieces, rinsed with 0.15M phosphate buffer and 0.15M sodium cacodylate buffer. Embedded samples were ultrathin-sectioned on a leica EM UC6 ultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) the resulting sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate before they were visualised using TEM. total RNA extraction and purification Total RNA was isolated from random sections of the left lung lobe (n = 5 per experimental group) an equimolar amount of reference cRNA was mixed with each experimental cRNA sample and was hybridised to Agilent mouse 444k oligonucleotide microarrays. arrays were scanned on an Agilent G2505B scanner for 17h in a hybridisation chamber at 65\u00b0C with a rotation speed of 10rpm. functional and pathway analysis of the DEGs was performed using the database for annotation, visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) v6.7. pathways with a Fisher\u2019s exact P value of 0.05 considered to be significantly enriched (over-represented) aTiO28, aTiO220, aTiO2300, rTiO220, rTiO220 (HY) and rTiO220 (HP) were elongated. the diameter of the cross sections ranged from 18nm to 52nm. DLS analysis revealed that all TiO2NPs agglomerate in water. rTiO220 (HP) had the smallest particle aggregate size of 39.37.3nm compared with 242.953.1nm or 242.956.4nm observed for aTiO220 and rTiO220 respectively. cytoplasm (Supplementary Figure 1A-i and A-n) and caveolin and near collagen fibres (Supplementary Figure 1A-f) were some of the structures of lungs where TiO2NPs were found on Day 1 post-exposure. particles were mostly found in a non-agglomerated state suggesting that over time the larger agglomerates may be breaking down. the mononuclear cells, neutrophils and lymphocytes accounted for 98\u201399.7%, 0.3\u20131.8% and 1.0% of the total cell population of control BALF respectively. a dose-dependent decrease in the number of mononuclear cells (Figure 2A-b) was observed at day 1 post-exposure, regardless of the type of TiO2NPs. raTiO220, rTiO220, rTiO220 (HY) and rTiO220 (HP) were determined by TEM analysis. the average diameter of each particle type showed values close to those reported by the manufacturer, except for aTiO2300 (Table 1). rTiO220 (HY) were 148.438.3, 130.149.8nm and 110.127.9. TEM images of vehicle only-exposed lung tissues did not reveal any particles on Day 1 and Day 28 post-exposure. all TiO2NPs were found mostly in an agglomerated state in lungs at all the doses tested. BALF from five mice from each control and exposed groups was assessed for differential cell counts. a non-significant dose-dependent increase in total cell number was observed on day 1 post-exposure. a dose-dependent decrease in the number of mononuclear cells was observed at Day 1 post-exposure. the highest increase in neutrophils was observed in mouse lungs exposed to rTiO220 (HP) the changes in the number of lymphocytes at any dose were not significant (Figure 2A-d). the mononuclear cells, neutrophils and lymphocytes accounted for 98\u201399.7%, 0.3\u20131.8% and 1.0% of the total cell population of control BALF. the highest increase in neutrophils was observed in mouse lungs exposed to rTiO220 (HP) aTiO28, aTiO220 and aTiO2300 were compared to understand size-related effects and raTiO220, rTiO220 (HY) and rTiO220 (HP) were compared to understand the influence of surface modification. each individual data set was analysed separately to identify the specific changes in gene expression compared with the matched vehicle controls. the most DEGs were associated with the inflammatory and acute phase signalling pathways. a total of 4, 4 and 72 upregulated and 0, 0 and 30 downregulated DEGs in the 54, 162 and 486 g dose groups. a2 (4.3-fold), Saa1 (8.4-fold), Timp1 (6.6-fold), Ccl7 (2.8-fold), Ccl17 (2.6-fold), Lcn2 (8.7-fold), Cxcl1 (2.1-fold), Cxcl10 (1.9-fold) and Cxcl5 (3.4-fold) were significantly expressed in mouse lungs exposed to aTiO2300 at the highest dose. rutile type raTiO220, rTiO220 (HY) and rTiO220 (HP) induced 33 DEGS (31 upregulated and 2 downregulated) in the 54 g, 108 DEGs (84 upregulated and 24 downregulated) in the 162 g and 714 DEGs (401 upregulated and 313 downregulated) at all the doses tested. 70, 134 and 177 genes were upregulated following exposure to raTiO220, rTiO220 (HY) or rTiO220 (HP) at the highest dose, the genes associated with inflammation including, Saa3 (64.5, 41.6, 87.6-fold), Saa2 (5.6, 5.1, 5.4-fold), Saa1 (13.0, 5.2, 11-fold), Ccl7 (4, 4, 6.2 fold), C ase inhibitor, clade E, member 1, (Serpine1, 2.6- fold) was upregulated only in the raTiO220 group. in the 486 g group, 9 were upregulated and 7 DEGs were downregulated. in response to rTiO220 (HP), 9 (2 upregulated, 2 downregulated), 13 (9 upregulated, 4 downregulated) and 34 (25 upregulated, 9 downregulated) genes showed differential expression in the 54, 162 pro-fibrotic genes including Cd14 (2.1-fold), Timp1 (2.5-fold) and Cyp7b1 (2.2-fold) following rTiO220 (HY) and Ccl2 (4.1-fold), Csf2 (2.1-fold), Cd14 (1.8-fold), Adora1 (1.7-fold) and Il1rn (1.5-fold) showed largest changes at the high dose. expression patterns were similar for individual mice within the same treatment groups. iO220, rTiO220 (HY) and rTiO220 (HP) were compared to the matched vehicle controls. each individual data set was analysed separately to identify the specific changes in gene expression compared with the matched vehicle controls. chemokine (C\u2013X\u2013C motif) ligand (Cxcl) 1 (Ccl2, 6.3-fold), ccl7 (6.8 fold), lipocalin 2 (Lcn2, 5.1-fold), chemokine (C\u2013X\u2013C motif) ligand (Cxcl1) 1 (Cxcl1, 4.0-fold), Cxcl10 (3.8-fold) and Cxcl5 (3.6-fold) were significantly a total of 8, 5 and 25 DEGs were found in the lungs of mice exposed to aTiO28, aTiO220 and aTiO2300. the aTiO28 group showed 2 (upregulated) and 8 (3 upregulated and 5 downregulated) DEGs in the 162 g and 486 g dose groups, respectively. rTiO220 (HY) modified with aluminum oxide and dimethicone induced significantly higher number of DEGs at all three doses and post-exposure time points. rTiO220 (HP) modified with aluminum oxide and dimethicone induced significantly higher number of DEGs compared with raTiO220 and rTiO220 (HP) l7 (4, 4, 6.2 fold), Ccl17 (3.5, 3.5, 3-fold), Lcn2 (9.3, 5.9, 8.5-fold) and Cxcl1 (2.2, 3.8, 3.2-fold) showed significant fold change following exposure to rTiO220 (HP) only. expression of interleukin 1 receptor, type II (Il1r2, 3.3, 2.7-fold), (Il1B, 1.9, 2.2-fold Ly6f (2.8-fold), Trem2 (2.2-fold), Nr1d2 (1.9-fold) and Spon2 (2.3-fold) were among the genes differentially expressed at the highest dose that were associated with inflammation. 3 (1 upregulated, 2 downregulated), 13 (9 upregulated, 4 downregulated) and 34 (25 upregulated, 9 downregulated) genes showed differential expression in the 54, 162 and 486 g groups, respectively. clustering of genes differentially expressed in at least one experimental condition was conducted to determine particle, dose, or time-dependent expression patterns. cluster-1 consisted of all doses of the five TiO2NPs for Day 28 post-exposure time point excluding raTiO220, along with Day 1 post-exposure samples of rTiO220 (HY) from the low-dose group. the common genes included Saa3, Saa1, Timp1, Lcn2, Ccl2, and Bcan. on day 28 post-exposure, only one DEG at the highest dose was common to all anatase groups. the list of all KEGG pathways affected at Day 1 post-exposure is provided in Supplementary Table 4. the cytokine\u2013cytokine receptor interaction (mmu04060), chemokine signalling pathway (mmu04062) and NOD-like receptor signalling (mmu04621) pathways implicated in the inflammation process were among the top pathways affected. aTiO28, aTiO220 and aTiO2300 induced 24, 12 and 24 DEGs associated with inflammation, 13, 4 and 8 DEGs associated with fibrosis and 2, 7 and 5 DEGs associated with oxidative stress. a large number of perturbed biological processes were observed in the 162 and 486 g dose groups. genes in the high-dose group of the aTiO2300 also perturbed steroid metabolic process (GO: 0008202) no biological processes were significantly altered in aTiO220-exposed lungs. the p53 signalling pathway was among the significantly perturbed KEGG pathways that was associated with DEGs of aTiO220 and aTiO2300. aTiO28, aTiO220 and aTiO2300 showed significant association with pathways of hepatic fibrosis and interleukin 17 signalling in fibroblasts. rutile/anatase raTiO220 induced the largest number of DEGs at the high dose on Day 1. there were 1, 15 and 36 genes common to rTiO220, rTiO220 (HY) and rTiO220 (HP) groups at the low, medium and high doses. only 1 and 2 DEGs were common to the three rutile NPs at medium and high doses and none at the rTiO220 (HY) group showed perturbations in inflammatory response (GO:0006954), response to wounding (GO:0009611), defense response (GO:0006952), chemotaxis (GO:0006935), taxis (GO:0042330) and behaviour (GO:0007610) at the highest dose. rTiO220 perturbed the alteration of regulation of transcription (GO:0045449), RNA metabolism (GO:00512 heat map depicts dose-dependent enrichment in canonical pathways in lungs exposed to raTiO220, rTiO220 (HY) and rTiO220 (HP) at day 1 and day 28 post-exposure. top five canonical pathways associated with DEGs include acute phase response signalling, agranulocyte adhesion and diapedesis, role of hypercytokinemia/hyperchemokinemia. rTiO220 (HY) and rTiO220 (HP) induced 6 and 11 DEGs associated with fibrosis on Day 1. only three DEGs were induced by rTiO220 (HP) on Day 28. rTiO220 perturbed the alteration of regulation of transcription (GO:0045449), RNA metabolism (GO:0051252), circadian rhythm (GO:0007623) and rhythmic processes (GO:0048511). no significant changes in the biological processes were observed in rTiO220 (HY) group at any dose at this late time point. hepatic fibrosis/hepatic stellate cell activation and hepatic cholestasis were perturbed even in the low-dose groups of the rutile raTiO220 and rTiO220 (HP) at day 1 post-exposure. altered inflammatory pathways such as acute phase response signalling, agranulocyte adhesion and diapedesis, granulocyte adhesion and dia only three DEGs were induced by rTiO220 (HP) on day 28. diseases and functions related to inflammation were activated in lungs treated with the anatase TiO2NPs on day 1 post-exposure. diseases and functions related to inflammation, fibrosis and oxidative stress were activated in the 162 and 486 g dose groups on Day 1 post-exposure. a numeric score from 0 to 5 was assigned based on a subjective assessment of the lesion severity. the results showed that lung sections from control mice are well ventilated with a few macrophages distributed diffusely in the alveolar spaces. in the alveolar macrophages was observed for some particle types mainly at 162 (Figure 6B-b\u2013g) or 486 g doses (Figure 6B-n\u2013s); however, this change was less significant compared with the day 1 post-exposure groups. rTiO220 (HY)- and rTiO220 (HP)-exposed lungs were stained with masson\u2019s trichrome staining to assess collagen deposition on day TEM analysis of lung sections showed that an appreciable fraction of TiO2NPs deposited via single intratracheal instillation were retained in lung tissues up to 90 days post-exposure regardless of the specific size or surface modifications. the TiO2NPs were mostly found dispersed in the cytoplasm and some were localized to phagocytic vacuoles. the -NAG activity increased significantly on day 1 following exposure to aTiO28 and rTiO220 (HY) at the medium and high doses and in lungs exposed to rTiO220 (HP) at the high-dose group compared with their matched controls. the increased -NAG activity increased significantly on day 1 in lungs of mice exposed to aTiO28 and rTiO220 (HY) at the medium and high doses staining for collagen revealed the presence of mild fibrosis in lungs exposed to aTiO28 (Figure 8A-j and A-p), rTiO220 (HY) and rTiO220 (HP). a mild and focal type 2 pneumocyte hypertrophy and hyperplasia was found only in lungs exposed to medium dose of rTiO220 (HP) underlying mechanisms of acute pulmonary inflammation induced by TiO2NPs are the same regardless of their properties. this is in alignment with previous study results published by this research group (22). the results show that while size may be the primary determinant of the toxic potential of TiO2NPs, surface modifications influence the severity of the response. anatase and rutile types exhibited a surface area between 51 and 57 m2/g. rTiO220 (HP) induced significantly higher number of genes at all doses. raTiO220 exerted higher toxicity compared with the other rutile or anatase only. the results of the gene expression analysis were not sensitive enough to identify the subtle differences between the responses induced by the different particle types. the results confirm that particle size for the unmodified and hydrophilic surface for the modified are the important properties playing a role in the toxicity induced by rTiO2NPs. raTiO220 showed highest number of differentially expressed genes acutely after the exposure at the highest dose tested. we speculate that the nature of the surface coating of the core NPs and resulting surface charge may play a role in determining NP\u2013cell interactions. a direct comparison of the 69 fibrosis-associated genes described in Poulsen et al. and Snyder-Talkington et al. study (27,50) with DEGs from the present study revealed a low level of concordance with very few overlapping genes. the subtle pro-fibrotic gene responses suggest that histopathological observations of fibrotic-like changes at the high doses of TiO2NPs may still be reflecting the early phase responses to disease development. aTiO28 aTiO220 aTiO2300 raTiO220 rTiO220 (HY) rTiO220 (HP) 24 h 24 h 24 h 24 h 28 days 28 days 28 days 28 days 28 days 28 days 28 days 28 days 28 days 28 days. several genes associated with the p53 signalling pathway were specifically altered. TEM analysis also found particles in the nucleus following exposure to aTiO28 and rTiO220 (HP) these results suggest some of them may have a potential to induce DNA damage. a 21-nm anatase/rutile (59) and a 33-nm aTiO2NPs (60) induce DNA damage. the primary particle size and the resulting surface area influence the toxicity induced by several classes of NMs including TiO2NPs. it is not known whether the underlying mechanisms of pulmonary inflammation are the same for all and it is also not clear whether subtle differences in the severity of acute pulmonary inflammation are the same for all. the number of DEGs at day 1 post-exposure to anatase-type TiO2NPs was remarkably lower for the aTiO2300 with the surface area of 10 m2/g (85 genes) the number of DEGs induced by rTiO220 (HY) was similar to the number of DEGs induced by rTiO220 (HY) rTiO220 (HP) induced significantly higher number of genes at all doses and post-exposure time points compared with other rutile and anatase TiO2NP types. results suggest that the transcriptional responses to rutile type TiO2NPs are influenced by their surface modifications and that the hydrophilic surface positively impacts the lung responses. rTiO220 induces pronounced generation of reactive oxygen species by decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential in human buccal epithelial TR146 cells. surface-coated NMs are shown to exert higher toxicity compared with the pristine types. silica-coated rutile TiO2NPs elicit higher pulmonary neutrophilia. studies have shown a differential cellular localisation of the hydrophilic TiO2NPs compared with the hydrophobic TiO2NPs (49). the poor interactions with the lipid bilayer may also prolong the life of hydrophilic NPs in blood, which will allow them to reach specific sites. the subtle pro-fibrotic gene responses suggest that histopathological observations of fibrotic-like changes at the high doses (162 g and 486 g/animal) of TiO2NPs may still be reflecting the early phase responses to disease development. a full manifestation of fibrosis may require recurring exposure to TiO2NPs at similar dose levels. TEM analysis also found particles in the nucleus following exposure to aTiO28 and rTiO220 NPs. a 21-nm anatase/rutile (59) and a 33-nm aTiO2NPs (60) induce DNA damage. positive genotoxic effects have not been observed in rodent lungs exposed to TiO2NPs via inhalation (61,62) however, the results are not consistent. some studies have investigated the genotoxic effects of TiO2NPs using in vitro models. supplementary data Supplementary Tables 1 to 7 and Supplementary Figures 1 to 8 are available at Mutagenesis Online. funding This work was supported by Health Canada\u2019s Genomics Research and Development Initiative and Chemicals Management Plan."}
