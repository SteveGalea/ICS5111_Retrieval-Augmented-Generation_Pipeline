{"summary": "infectious bronchitis is caused by IB virus (IBV), which is one of the primary agents of respiratory disease in chickens worldwide. it replicates at many nonrespiratory epithelial surfaces, where it may cause pathology, for example, kidney and gonads. the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has proved useful in the detection of several RNA viruses. outbreaks of the disease can occur even in vaccinated flocks because there is little or no cross-protection between serotypes. first step is to study the virus strains distributed in the geographical region and determine their antigenicity and pathogenicity. all birds were serologically tested using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. they were negative for antibodies to infectious bronchitis virus antigens. five birds were killed and their organs were investigated for virus detection. the mixture was centrifuged at 12000 rpm at 4\u00b0C for 15 min. the upper phase was added to an equal volume of isopropyl alcohol. the pellet was dissolved in a final volume of 50 L distilled water. the primers were specific for 3\u2032 UTR gene [14]. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique was used to measure antibody levels to avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) ten chickens in the inoculated and control groups were bled at days 0, 5, 11, 15, and 20 PI. serum samples were diluted and added to microtitre wells where any anti-IBV antibodies and other serum proteins were then washed away. experimental design Ninety-one-day-old commercial broiler chicks were divided randomly into two groups (seventy chicks in the experimental and twenty chicks in the control group) they were reared separately in the Animal Research Unit of the Veterinary School of Shiraz University and received feed and water ad libitum. RNA of the samples was immediately stored at 70\u00b0C until used. PCR was performed to amplify a 276-bp fragment of the 3\u2032 UTR gene. the program in Ependorf thermal cycler was 95\u00b0C for 3 min and 35 cycles including 95\u00b0C for 45 sec., 55.6\u00b0C for 45 sec, 72\u00b0C for 50 sec, and a postpolymerization step at 72\u00b0C for 7 min. tracheal mucosa showed mild tracheal rales, coughing, and gasping at 24 hours PI. the signs were less severe after 4 days PI. no mortality was observed in any of the groups. the virus was detected in the caecal tonsil at day 20 when the virus was not detected in any other tissue. the virus was also detected in the testes consistently for 11 days. increased ab titers occurred 11 days after inoculation. titers were negative at 0, 5, and 11 days PI but they were positive at 15 and 20 days. sera of the control was negative (833) on all of the days PI. a were observed in the euthanased birds from 1 to 3 days PI. pale and swollen kidneys were observed from 5 to 10 days PI. no clinical signs and gross lesions were observed in uninfected control chickens. serological Result The sera from chickens of different groups were screened for antibodies levels against IBV using ELISA. for the result to be valid, the mean negative control absorbance should be read below 0.3. the pathogenesis of the infectious bronchitis virus isolate IRFIBV32 was evaluated following intranasal (IN) inoculation of commercial broiler chickens by RT-PCR. after 24 hours postinoculation, the challenge infected chickens exhibited mild tracheal rales, coughing, and gasping. trachea, lung, kidney, and cecal tonsils from birds were analyzed. representative RT-PCR results are shown. IRFIBV32 isolate has broad tissue distribution. the nephropathogenic property of their IBV was longer lasting than the respiratory involvement. in our investigation, virus was detected from kidneys more often than the tracheas. in chickens, the virus has been routinely isolated from the trachea, lung, intestine, and bursa. ELISA detected moderate levels of the antibody to IBV on 11 days PI and high levels of antibody against IBV on day 20 PI."}
