{"summary": "in 2004, the national information reporting system of infectious diseases (NDRS) was integrated into NDRS to improve case-based reporting. the workflow includes data collection, data management, data use, and report dissemination. CDCs at different levels can download these reports and know the national status in a timely manner. population and case definition We divided population into citizens of china and foreign citizens according to their native countries. imported cases included citizens of china returning from migrant work or other travel abroad. local CDC staff ascertained a potential imported case according to the field investigation results after diagnosis. a case of notifiable infectious disease or emerging infectious disease is identified. it is mandatory for doctors in all hospitals and clinics to report to the network within the statutory period. the completeness and timeliness of case reporting have improved dramatically since 2004 (9) the major occupational categories of patients were migrant workers, doctors, teachers, students, and retirees. a case in a patient who had visited or lived in an endemic or epidemic area outside China within the longest incubation period before the date of onset was classified as an imported case. a case would be classified as a domestic case if there was no evidence of an infection acquired abroad. 10,506 160,181 6.6 Yunnan, Guangxi Asia (Myanmar), Africa (Ghana) Undetermined species 29,929 2,095 32,024 6.5 NA NA Subtotal 187,684 27,497 215,181 8.1 NA NA Dengue fever 58,602 3,351 61,953 5.4 Yunnan Asia (Myanmar) Influenza A(H1N1) 75,924 773 76,697 median age of patients with imported cases was 39 years; of patients with dengue fever, 32 years; and of influenza A(H1N1), 20 years. migrant workers from china accounted for 65.2% of imported malaria cases and 28.1% of imported dengue fever cases. 1 0 2 2 Scrub typhus 3 (42.9) 4 (57.1) 23 (3\u201342) 2 (28.6) 5 (71.4) 0 7 7 VL 13 (92.9) 1 (7.1) 34 (25\u201349) 14 (100.0) 0 (0.0) 13 (92.9) 1 (7.1) 14 JE 12 (70.6) 5 (29.4) 8 (1\u201354) 5 (29.4) 12 (70.6) 0 17 17 EHF 7 (100.0) 0 48 (25\u201371) imported cases of malaria, dengue fever, and influenza A(H1N1) cases in mainland China, 2005\u20132016. in 2005, only 2 types of imported infectious diseases were reported in mainland China. imported malaria, dengue fever, and influenza A(H1N1) cases were reported in mainland china, 2005\u20132016. the number of imported malaria cases in Yunnan Province was generally decreasing. the number of imported malaria cases in Yunnan Province was generally decreasing. africa was the main region of origin for imported malaria (14,854 cases, 54.0%), and others, especially Plasmodium falciparum, yellow fever, loiasis, and other diseases.

HF, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, EHEC, Escherichia coli O157:H7, EHF, epidemic hemorrhagic fever, JE, Japanese encephalitis, and MERS were reported in 2015. most yellow fever cases were imported in march. there was usually a higher incidence of imported malaria during April\u2013August. incidence of imported dengue fever usually peaked in October. africa and Asia were the main regions of origin of imported cases. Asia was the main origin of imported dengue fever (3,097 cases, 92.4%), chikungunya, VL, JE, and other diseases. Myanmar was the main country of origin for 5 imported diseases. these diseases were malaria (7,888 cases, 28.7%), dengue fever (1,384 cases, 41.3%), scrub typhus (6 cases, 85.7%), JE (13 cases, 76.5%), and acute flaccid paralysis (2 cases, 100.0%) the number of imported cases of P. vivax malaria from Ethiopia, Angola, Equatorial Guinea began to increase slightly. imported dengue fever cases were mainly from angola, Nigeria, Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, and other countries in Africa. influenza A(H1N1) was imported mainly from the united states (141 cases, 18.2%) and Australia (111 cases, 14.4%). influenza A(H1N1) was imported mainly from the United States (141 cases, 18.2%) and Australia (111 cases, 14.4%). Influenza A(H1N1) was imported mainly into Beijing, Guangdong, and other major port cities. origin region/country of Imported Diseases According to our analysis, Africa and Asia were the main regions of origin of imported cases. Asia was the main origin of imported dengue fever (3,097 cases, 92.4%), chikungunya, VL, JE, and other diseases. Myanmar was the main country of origin for 5 imported diseases. these diseases were malaria (7,888 cases, 28.7%), dengue fever (1,384 cases, 41.3%), scrub typhus (6 cases, 85.7%), JE (13 cases, 76.5%), and acute flaccid paralysis (2 cases, 100.0%) malaria was imported mainly from Africa (14,854 cases, 54.0%) and Asia (9,160 cases, 33.3%) in 2013, the largest number of cases of P. falciparum malaria came from Ghana. in 2013, most cases were imported from angola, Nigeria, Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, and other countries in Africa, mainly into Guangxi, Jiangsu, and other southeastern provinces in China. influenza A(H1N1) was imported mainly from the united states (141 cases, 18.2%) and Australia (111 cases, 14.4%) the number of cases of P. falciparum malaria imported into Guangxi Province increased significantly in 2013. this increase can be attributed to cases imported from Ghana in 2013, which was related to people working in Ghana and other Africa countries during a gold rush in that year. the number of migrant workers from China in Africa and Asia has increased annually in recent years. migrant workers from china accounted for a large proportion of imported malaria. migrant workers from china accounted for a large proportion of imported malaria. there is currently no special reporting system for imported infectious diseases in china. a second limitation is that the data of this study were obtained from the monitoring system. there are few denominator data to use for calculating the rates of imported infectious diseases, so conclusions are limited and risks cannot be calculated. to control and prevent imported infectious diseases, we recommend several measures. the number of emerging infectious diseases imported into china has increased year by year. the number of emerging infectious diseases imported into china has increased year by year. the number of emerging infectious diseases imported into china has increased year by year."}
