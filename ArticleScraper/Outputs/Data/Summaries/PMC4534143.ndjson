{"summary": "bocavirus (hBoV) is a viral agent that belongs to the family Parvoviridae. it contains a single linear positive-sense or negative-sense single-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid genome. this virus has been detected mainly in younger children, in nasopharyngeal secretions, in sera and blood samples of patients with upper (URTI) and lower (LRTI) respiratory tract infections. nasopharyngeal secretions were collected from children attending the emergency room of the Fondazione IRCCS Ca\u2019 Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy. the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Fondazione IRCCS Ca\u2019 Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, University of Milan, Italy. patients were classified into disease groups (i.e., acute otitis media, rhinosinusitis, pha the extract was tested for respiratory viruses using the respiratory virus panel xTAG RVP FAST v2 (Luminex Molecular Diagnostics, Inc., Toronto, Canada) it simultaneously detects influenza A virus (subtypes H1 or H3); influenza B virus; respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) types A and B; human parainfluenza virus types 1\u20134 (hPiV1-4); adenovirus (AdV); human metapneumovirus (hMP each 25 L singleplex reaction mixture consisted of 0.5 L of forward primer 5\u2019-TGCAGACAACGCYTAGTTGTTT-3\u2019 and reverse primer 5\u2019-CTGTCCCGCCCAAGATACA-3\u2019. PCRs were conducted at 50\u00b0C for 2 min and then at 95\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 45 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 15 sec and at 60\u00b0C for 1 min. spectrophotometer (NanoDrop products, Wilmington, DE, USA) each run included plasmid and negative controls. negative controls were included in every PCR assay. quantitative results were reported as DNA copies/mL of respiratory samples. phylogenetic trees of the hBoV VP-1/2 protein gene were generated using the neighbour-joining method and p-distance model of the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analyses (MEGA) software. the graphs were made using GraphPad Prism version 5.01 for Windows (GraphPAD Software, San Diego, CA) EL and MEME p-values of 0.1 and a FUBAR posterior probability of >0.90 were accepted as candidates for selection. categorical variables were presented as mean values and standard deviations (SDs) for categorical data, comparisons between groups were performed using a contingency table analysis. patients were classified into disease groups on the basis of signs and/or symptoms using well-established criteria. they were finally subdivided into two subgroups: upper (URTIs) and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) amplification and detection of viral DNA were performed with a 7900HT real-time PCR System machine (Applied Biosystems, California, USA) each 25 L singleplex reaction mixture consisted of 0.5 L of forward primer 5\u2019-TGCAGACAACGCYTAGTTGTTT-3\u2019 and reverse primer 5\u2019-CTGTCCCGCCCAAGATACA-3\u2019 for the 88 base pair NS-1 target. each run included one synthetic template control and one no-template control for each target. specimen extracts were also tested by real-time PCR for the human RNase-P gene. sequence analysis performed on a 3130 Genetic Analyser. phylogenetic trees of the VP-1/2 gene were generated using the neighbour-joining method and p-distance model of the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analyses. the SLAC approach counts the ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous changes per non-synonymous site (dS) sites with SLAC, FEL, IFEL and MEME p-values of 0.1 and a posterior probability of >0.90 were accepted as candidates for selection. 1,823 nasopharyngeal samples were collected in the emergency room. of these, 104 (5.7%) tested positive for hBoV. HBoV was the only virus detected in 57/104 (54.8%) cases. p-value = 0.03 for comparison between subgroups of presence of co-infection(s) according to age group. all of the Italian hBoV strains detected during the three study periods belonged to hBoV genotype 1. a total of 61/672 amino acid positions were observed to have at least one change in the VP1/VP2 sequence alignments. of these, 7/61 (11.5%) changes occurred within the VP1 unique (VP1U) region corresponding to the first 129 amino acids at the N-terminus of the VP1 gene. hBoV st1 strains had 13 and 14 amino acid changes compared to the hBoV st1 strain. the origin of this highly divergent region, which occurred in spite of the conservation displayed in the rest of hBoV DNA genome, remains to be defined. a wide range of hBoV DNA levels from 3.5x102 to 7.5x109 copies/mL were found in the clinical samples. a total of 16 strains had a very high viral load, and 13/16 (81.3%) harboured the T590S mutation. frequency (42/70; 53.8%) of T590S in the group of strains described below (p = 0.08) seven of the 13 strains with the T590S mutation had an additional mutation in one of the sites under positive selection. we hypothesize that the double mutation of N546H with T590S may positively affect viral replication and specific immune response. children infected with only hBoV-1 had URTIs more frequently than those with a co-infection. a similar illness in the family in the 7 days since patient enrolment was significantly more common among co-infected children than among those with a single infection. clinical findings Cough 41/49 (83.7) 39/47 (83.0) 0.93 Rhonchi 2/49 (4.1) 4/47 (8.5) 0.43 Rales 15/49 (30.6) 15/47 (31.9) 0.89 Wheezes 7/49 (14.3) 9/47 (19.1) 0.52 Upper respiratory tract infection 17/46 (37.0) 8/45 (17.8) 0.04 Lower respiratory tract infection 25/55 (45.4) 24/46 (52.2) 0.50 Clinical outcome Hospitalisation rate, b 0.7 0.6 0.6 0.8 0.88 CRP, g/dL 6.2 15.4 1.4 2.2 0.32 CRP: C reactive protein; SD: standard deviation; SpO2: peripheral oxygen saturation.\u201d38.0\u00b0C or more any time during the illness (before or at enrolment, or during follow-up), \u00b039.0\u00b0C or more.
