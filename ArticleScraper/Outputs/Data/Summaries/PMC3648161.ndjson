{"summary": "the attenuated vaccine replicates to a low level but induces immune response and memory that are sufficient to prevent virulent virus infection. the traditional method of developing an attenuated vaccine is by passaging the virus through a foreign host (e.g., tissue culture or live animals) the virus is replicative and induces protective immunity. infections by wild-type (WT) and 2\u2032-O MTase mutant WNVs induce equivalent levels of type I interferon (IFN) (3). the 2\u2032-O MTase mutant MHV induced a higher level of interferon expression than did the WT MHV (4). these results prompted us to test the hypothesis of using 2\u2032-O methylation-defective virus as a live attenuated vaccine. ations use S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) as a methyl donor and generate S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (SAH) as a by-product (9). the K-D-K-E motif forms the active site of the 2\u2032-O cap and internal adenosine methylation activities (5, 6, 10) ase representing the 300 amino acids of NS5 derived from the JEV strain AJE70 was expressed and purified from Escherichia coli Rosetta 2(DE3)pLysS cells. a DNA fragment representing the MTase domain was PCR amplified from the JEV strain genome and cloned into an expression plasmid, pET28(a), at NdeI and XhoI sites. the RNA substrate representing the first 190 nucleotides of the 5\u2032 end of the JEV genome was used for the MTase assay. the 33P-labeled m7G*pppA- and G*pppA-RNA were used for N-7 and 2\u2032-O methylations. a single E218A mutation in NS5 was introduced into the infectious cDNA clone (pAJE70) by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis. the positive clones were finally sequenced to confirm the designed mutations and designated pAJE70-E218A. RNA transcripts from pAJE70 and pAJE70-E218A were then transfected into BHK-21 cells with Lipofectamine 2000 (Li muant viruses recovered from viral RNA-transfected cells (passage 0), as well as the viruses after passage on Vero cells for 5 (passage 5) and 10 (passage 10) rounds were analyzed by plaque assays as previously described (12). cells were preseeded into 48-well plates and then infected with WT and E218A viruses at a multiplicity of infection (MOI of 1. group of 4-week-old female BALB/c mice (n = 10) were subcutaneously immunized with 1 104 PFU of E218A virus. i.p. challenged with lethal doses of JEV strains SX-06 (genotype I) and SA14 (genotype III) mortality was monitored for at least 15 days. IgG in 0.02% Evans blue dilutions was added and incubated at 37\u00b0C for another 30 min. positive cells were detected using a fluorescence microscope. dilutions of serum samples were mixed with equal volumes of JEV suspension. cells grown in 96-well plates were infected at an MOI of 5 with WT or E218A virus for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. cell viability was determined by the MTS assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. s modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) cells were grown at 28\u00b0C in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% FBS. titers were determined in BHK-21 cells by standard plaque formation assay. lysate supernatant was eluted with a lysis buffer containing 200 mM imidazole. the purified protein was stored at 80\u00b0C before use. RNA substrate representing the first 190 nucleotides of the 5\u2032 end of the JEV genome was used for the MTase assay. the reaction mixture was incubated at 23\u00b0C for 15 to 30 min. all the reactions were stopped by phenol-chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation. methylated RNA products were resuspended in RNase-free H2O. indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) was performed to characterize the expression of JEV E protein in BHK-21 cells transfected with equal amounts of RNA transcripts. Briefly, the transfected cells were fixed with cold acetone and incubated with the mouse monoclonal antibody (MAb) 4D5 specific for JEV E protein (14), followed by goat anti-mouse IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugate at least three of the infected mice were bled periorbitally and dissected at 1, 3, 5, and 7 days postinfection. brains, spinal cords, livers, spleens, and kidneys were collected, homogenized, and diluted with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) IFA was used to measure the IgG antibody titer against JEV in the sera of immunized mice. FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG in 0.02% Evans blue dilutions was added and incubated at 37\u00b0C for another 30 min. the splenocyte proliferation was determined with the MTS method. the stimulation index (SI) was calculated as mean OD values of stimulated cells/mean OD values of unstimulated cells. an SI of 2 was considered significant. at 24, 48, and 72 h postinfection by plaque assay. the significance between survival curves from each group was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis with log-rank tests. m7GppppAm7GpppAm conversion knocked out 2\u2032-O methylation. m7GppppAm7GpppAm conversion is essential for 2\u2032-O methylation. reaction mixtures were digested with nuclease P1. 33P-labeled cap structures (m7G*pppA or G*pppA) are indicated on the bottom of the TLC plate. the position of the origin and the migration positions of the G*pppA, m7G*pppA, and m7G*pppAm molecules are shown to the right of the TLC plate. some groups found that m7GpppAm migrated faster than m7GpppA (6, 18, 19), whereas others showed that m7GpppAm migrated slower than m7GpppA (20). after the 2\u2032-O methylation reaction was cleaved with the nuclease P1 purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (catalog no. N8630), the m7GpppAm product migrated faster than m7Gp mutant virus replicated slightly slower than the WT virus at 24 and 48 h. however, the virus peaked at similar levels at 72 h postinfection. genome sequencing of the passage 10 virus showed that the engineered E218A change was retained without any extra mutation. mice were i.p. injected with 4 107 PFU of WT or E218A JEV. mortality was monitored for 15 days or till death. mice were inoculated with serial dil. the LD50 of the E218A mutant virus was about 24-fold higher than that of the WT virus-infected mice. the AST of the mutant virus-inoculated mice for each dose was significantly longer than that of the WT virus-infected mice. a single-dose immunization with 1 104 PFU of E218A induced robust IgG and neutralizing antibodies. the geometric mean titer of neutralizing antibody against JEV reached 97.4 at 28 days postimmunization. no JEV-specific antibodies were detected in the sera collected prior to the immunization or from the PBS-immunized animals. cellular immunity to JEV was determined by splenocyte proliferative response and IFN- production in splenocytes from the vaccinated mice on day 28 postimmunization. a single-dose vaccination with the E218A virus induces robust humoral and cellular immune responses in mice. all the PBS-immunized mice died within 6 to 10 days after the challenge. a high dose of 5 107 PFU of the E218A virus failed to kill any 129 mice. both the WT and E218A viruses showed 100% mortality within 4 days in the A129 mice. only a slight delay of death was observed in the A129 mice. the mutant virus was more sensitive to the antiviral effect of various concentrations of IFN- than was the WT. we compared the antiviral effects of human IFIT-1, -2, -3, or -5 on the WT and mutant viruses. the mutant virus was only slightly impaired by the same dose of IFN- treatment. acid E218 represents the glutamic acid within the K-D-K-E tetrad of the JEV MTase domain. the purified proteins were >95% pure with the expected molecular mass of 35 kDa. the reaction products were digested with nuclease P1 and analyzed on a TLC plate. the reaction mixtures were digested with nuclease P1 (purchased from us Biological) and analyzed on TLC plates. the conversion of G*pppA-RNA to m7G*pppA-RNA was quantified. 2\u2032-O methylation assays were the same as those in panel D. the reaction was done at 23\u00b0C for 30 min (JEV MTase) or 37\u00b0C for 30 min (VP39) half of the samples were digested with nuclease P1 in 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer. the other half of the samples were digested with nuclease P1 in the same buffer. product migrated slower than m7GpppA. for this experiment, we used the WT MTase as well as vaccinia virus VP39. we currently do not know what component(s) in the nuclease P1 reaction mixtures from the two vendors caused the difference in migration. BHK-21 cells were transfected with equal amounts of RNA transcripts from pAJE70 and pAJE70-E218A. they were subjected to IFA using anti-JEV E protein MAb 4D5 at the indicated time posttransfection. the mutant virus could be detected in brains only at days 3 and 5 postinfection. titers were much lower than those from the WT group. the 2\u2032-O MTase mutant is highly attenuated in mice. the mortality was monitored for 15 days or till death. the 2\u2032-O MTase mutant virus induces a protective immune response in mice. a single-dose immunization with 1 104 PFU of E218A virus induced robust IgG and neutralizing antibodies. mice immunized with 1 104 PFU of E218A or in the control group were bled at 14 and 28 days postimmunization. the titers of IgG antibody (A) and neutralization antibody (B) were determined by IFA and PRNT. a single-dose vaccination with the E218A virus induces robust humoral and cellular immune responses in mice. we challenged the immunized mice with lethal doses of JEV strains SX-06 and SA14. all the PBS-immunized mice died within 6-10 days after the challenge. ase mutant showed enhanced sensitivity to IFN and IFITs. mortality was monitored for 15 days or till death. HEK293 cells transgenically expressing individual IFITs were infected with the WT or mutant virus. western blotting showed equal levels of IFIT-1, -2, -3, and -5 protein expression in the transfected HEK293 cells. as a control, Western blotting showed equal levels of IFIT-1, -2, -3, and -5 protein expression in the transfected HEK293 cells. this is attributable to the enhanced sensitivity to the antiviral action of IFN and IFIT proteins. we showed that recombinant JEV lacking 2\u2032-O MTase activity was replicative. cells infected with the mutant virus did not induce higher levels of IFN production. the latter result is similar to that observed for the 2\u2032-O MTase mutant WNV (3, 4) but different from that observed for the 2\u2032-O MTase mutant MHV (which showed higher IFN production than did the WT virus [4]). nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of influenza A and B viruses antagonizes the IFN response following infection and contributes to the virulence. viruses with partial deletions of NS1 are attenuated and yet induce a protective immune response in mice (1). a live JE vaccine strain, SA14-14-2, has been widely used in 10 Asian countries. a virus induced high titers of neutralizing antibodies (GMT = 97.4) and robust cellular immune responses in mice. previous clinical trials and animal experiments with JEV vaccine showed that a neutralization antibody titer of more than 10 was protective (30). the 2\u2032-O MTase mutant was attenuated due to the single E218A mutation in NS5 protein via a defined mechanism in association with the host IFN response."}
