{"summary": "Background Type I interferons (IFNs) exhibit direct antiviral effects, but also distinct immunomodulatory properties. results were obtained when mice were vaccinated against HIV with adenoviral vectors encoding FV Env and Gag proteins. type I IFNs modulate adaptive immune responses by activating antigen-presenting cells, promoting natural killer cell cytotoxicity and enhancing the proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. distinct anti-viral and immunomodulatory effects of type I IFN subtypes were demonstrated in several infection models. the vaccine of a community-risk group with a prime-boost combination of protein- and canarypox vector-based vaccines conferred moderate protection. this data, together with results from animal models, indicate that for the prevention of HIV infection, both cellular and humoral responses are necessary. we used the Friend virus (FV) model to analyze the protective effect of type I subtypes on adenovirus-based immunization. adenoviral vectors encoding adenoviral vectors expressing FV proteins and specific type I IFN subtypes. results Enhanced FV immune protection after co-administration of adenoviral vectors expressing HIV Env and Gag-Pol proteins. we also performed immunizations of mice with adenoviral vectors encoding type I IFN subtypes. 109 VP of each vector (1 1010 VP total dose) was chosen because it induces only moderate protection on its own. mice received the adenoviral vectors encoding the selected type I IFN subtypes described above. mice were challenged with FV and the spleen size as a surrogate marker for disease progression was monitored by abdominal palpation. mice were co-administered vectors encoding IFN2, IFN4, IFN6 or IFN9. spleens were removed and weighed on day 21 p.c. spleens were removed and weighed (C) the disease progression was monitored by twice-weekly palpations of the spleen. mice were administered type I IFN encoding vectors alone and challenged afterwards with FV. co-administration of specific type I IFN subtypes mediated improved control over viral replication after FV challenge. mice were prime- and boost-immunized with Ad5 and Ad5F35 based vectors. they were encoding F-MuLV Env and Gag with or without co-administration. viral loads in spleen were analyzed on day 10 p.c. no adjuvant effect on vaccine protection against FV was found for IFN1 and IFN5 co-expression enhanced vaccine-induced CD4+ T cell responses. we analyzed the virus-specific T cell response in mice vaccinated either with Env- and Gag-encoding vectors alone or in combination with vectors encoding the four subtypes that improved protection. representative dot plots from an unvaccinated mouse and mice vaccinated with env+gag or env+gag+IFN4 are shown. the role of T cells in IFN subtype mediated enhanced vaccine protection against FV. depletion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells during vaccination did not result in reduced protection in mice inoculated with vectors encoding Env- and Gag and IFN4. the depletion abolished the protective effect of the Env/Gag/IFN4 vaccine completely as indicated by severe splenomegaly. spleens were palpated twice a week to monitor disease progression (A) viral loads in spleen were analyzed on day 21 p.c. (C) mice were immunized once with the indicated vectors and expression of CD43, CD44, CD62L and CCR7 on CD4+ T cells in the draining lymph nodes was analyzed 10 days after immunization. only two out of six mice had developed detectable F-MuLV-binding antibodies after the boost immunization. all mice that had received vectors encoding IFN2, IFN4, IFN6 or IFN9 had significantly higher mean F-MuLV-binding antibody titers (P 0.05) at ten days after FV challenge, most vaccinated animals showed low titers of F-MuLV-neutralizing antibodies compared to the group of Env compared to unvaccinated control mice (*) or mice vaccinated with Env- plus Gag-encoding vectors (#) are indicated. each dot represents an individual mouse. similar results were obtained when mice were immunized twice with a prime boost immunization protocol using Ad5-based vectors for priming and Ad5F35-based vectors for boosting. however, the differences between the groups were not as pronounced as after only one vaccination. expression levels of TNF and IFN were comparable in all immunized mice irrespective of IFN co-administration. similar results were obtained when CD8+ T cells were restimulated with an Env-derived epitope peptide. this data underline the impact of specific type I IFNs on vaccine-induced CD4+ T cell responses. mice received the adenoviral vectors encoding the selected type I IFN subtypes described above. mice were challenged with FV and the spleen size as a surrogate marker for disease progression was monitored by abdominal palpation. increased protection after co-administration of the four IFN subtypes was confirmed when animals were sacrificed and spleen weights were measured on day 21 p.c. mice were co-administered vectors encoding IFN2, IFN4, IFN6 or IFN9. spleens were removed and weighed on day 21 p.c. spleens were removed and weighed (C) the disease progression was monitored by twice-weekly palpations of the spleen. mice were administered type I IFN encoding vectors alone and challenged afterwards with FV. co-administration of specific type I IFN subtypes mediated improved control over viral replication. mice were prime- and boost-immunized with Ad5 and Ad5F35 based vectors. they were encoding F-MuLV Env and Gag with or without co-administration. viral loads in spleen were analyzed on day 10 p.c. no adjuvant effect on vaccine protection against FV was found for IFN1 and IFN5. IFN2, 4, 6 and 9 co-expression enhanced vaccine-induced CD4+ T cell responses. for FV, only one H2-Db-restricted CD8+ T cell epitope, the GagL epitope [21] has been identified so far. representative dot plots from unvaccinated mouse and mice vaccinated with env+gag or env+gag+IFN4 are shown. the role of T cells in IFN subtype mediated enhanced vaccine protection against FV. depletion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells during vaccination did not result in reduced protection in mice inoculated with vectors encoding Env- and Gag and IFN4. this indicates that in the absence of CD8+ T cells reactive to the immunodominant GagL epitope, also no CD8+ T cells of other, unknown specificity played a major role in vaccine-mediated protection. spleens were palpated twice a week to monitor disease progression (A) viral loads in spleen were analyzed on day 21 p.c. (C) mice were immunized once with the indicated vectors. expression of CD43, CD44, CD62L and CCR7 on CD4+ T cells in the draining lymph nodes was analyzed 10 days after immunization. only two out of six mice had developed detectable F-MuLV-binding antibodies after boost immunization. all mice that had received vectors encoding IFN2, IFN4, IFN6 or IFN9 had significantly higher mean F-MuLV-binding antibody titers. at ten days after FV challenge, most vaccinated animals showed low titers of F-MuLV-neutralizing antibodies compared to the group of Env- and Gag compared to unvaccinated control mice (*) or mice vaccinated with adenovirus-based vaccine (#) are indicated. each dot represents an individual mouse. data are representative of two independent experiments with similar results. mice were immunized twice with a prime boost immunization protocol. IFN2, IFN4 or IFN9 enhanced CD4+ T cells responses. differences between the groups were not as pronounced as after only one vaccination. expression levels of TNF and IFN were comparable in all immunized mice irrespective of IFN co-administration. similar results were obtained when CD8+ T cells were restimulated with an Env-derived epitope peptide. this data underline the impact of specific type I IFNs on vaccine-induced CD4+ T cell responses. only little effect on the CD8+ T cell response could be demonstrated. the importance of the FV-specific CD4+ T cell response for vaccine protection was emphasized by a depletion experiment. the kinetic analysis of the early activation of B cells and CD4+ T cells after vaccination suggests that co-administration of IFN4 might influence the CD4+ memory T cell formation. an improved central memory CD4+ T cell response might be critical for enhanced virus-specific cellular and humoral recall responses after virus challenge. type I IFNs can promote expansion of CD4+ T cells either indirectly through effects on antigen-presenting cells or through direct action. this is supported by the fact that we see a strong correlation of high control of FV-induced disease with the augmented CD4+ T cell response. cells with effector phenotype were detected after immunization. this is in line with previous reports that after vaccination with vaccinia viruses encoding different F-MuLV Gag constructs also regions other than the leader can induce protective CD8+ T cell immune responses. however, our CD8+ T cell depletion experiment did not result in reduced protection, suggesting that CD8+ T cell responses against other epitopes did not play a critical role for the improved protection after co-administration of adenovirus-induced type I IFN response was predominantly comprised of IFN1, IFN5 and IFN [46]. the homology between murine and human type I interferons is rather low with about 70-75% at the nucleotide level. different IFN subtypes have distinct potencies as vaccine adjuvants should hold true for human IFN subtypes as well. the protective effect of low-dose immunization against retroviruses with adenoviral vectors could be highly improved by co-administration of specific vectored type I IFN subtypes. this induced strong CD4+ T cell responses and enhanced binding antibody titers. a murine fibroblast cell line from Mus dunni [50] was maintained in RPMI medium. cell lines were maintained in humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. adenoviral vectors Ad5.env, Ad5F35.env, Ad5.gag, and Ad5F35.gag [18] encode full-length F-MuLV Env or Gag proteins amplified by PCR from FB29 [51]. cDNAs for IFN1, IFN2, IFN4, IFN5, IFN6, IFN9 and IFN were subcloned from the plasmids pkCMVint.IFN1, pkCMVint.IFN2, pkCMVint.IFN4, pkCMVint.IFN5 and pkCMVint.IFN [5] into pShuttle. all adenoviral vectors mice were immunized with 1 109 VP of type I IFN-encoding vectors alone. mice were injected intraperitoneally with antibodies 191.1 or 169.4 [56] to deplete CD4+ or CD8+ cells around the time of vaccination. mice were vaccinated with a single or a prime-boost immunization with Ad5-based vectors encoding HIV Env and Gag-Pol mixed with type I IFN- or luciferase-encoding vectors. mice were challenged by the intravenous injection of 250 spleen focus-forming units. ethanol labeled with F-MuLV Env-specific MAb 720 [60] and then with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit antimouse Ig antibody. the assay was developed using aminoethylcarbazole (Sigma-Aldrich, Deisenhofen, Germany) as substrate to detect foci. spleens were removed and weighed, and single-cell suspensions were prepared. spleen cells were stained with a phycoerythrin-coupled major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II tetramer. spleen cells were stained with a phycoerythrin-coupled major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II tetramer. dilutions that resulted in a reduction of foci by 50% or more were considered neutralizing. data were acquired on a flow cytometer (FACSCalibur;
