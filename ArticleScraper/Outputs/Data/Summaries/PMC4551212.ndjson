{"summary": "cellular proteins are regulated by a diverse range of chemical modifications on their amino acid side chains. these various modifying groups can affect charge, hydrophobicity, and other aspects of protein chemistry. these lipid modifications increase protein hydrophobicity and can impact on protein structure and the affinity of proteins for cellular membranes or membrane domains. geranylgeranylation signal (non-CAAX) is recognized by the enzyme geranylgeranyl transferase II. the main types of fatty acylation characterized to date are N-myristoylation and S-acylation. this modification requires the previous removal of the initiating methionine residue (65). N-myristoylation does not occur exclusively as a cotranslational modification. it can also take place posttranslationally when NH2-terminal glycine residues are exposed following protein cleavage, for example, during apoptosis (264). recent breakthroughs have identified the enzymes and developed highly sensitive techniques to study this process. zDHHC acyltransferases are predicted transmembrane proteins (C) with the catalytic DHHC domain located in a cytosolic loop. in this review we first outline some general features of S-acylation including its ubiquity, reversibility, and diversity of substrates. we then outline some of the key regulatory effects S-acylation may have on protein function and subcellular localization. analysis of viral protein S-acylation has made a significant contribution to current knowledge about S-acylation in general. labile nature of thioester bonds allows many (but not all) S-acylated proteins to undergo rapid cycles of S-acylation and deacylation. the reversibility of S-acylation sets this process apart from other lipid modifications and implies an important role for S-acylation in the dynamic regulation of cellular proteins. a major outstanding question in S-acylation research relates to how the dynamics of acyl chains on S-acylated proteins is regulated. palmitate, 22% were stearate, and 4% were oleate (174). studies using cell lines have highlighted similar heterogeneity in fatty acids. acyl chain heterogeneity in S-acylated proteins is widely recognized. teomic profiling of S-acylated proteins from a variety of different cell types has revealed the diverse nature of the modified proteins. the modified proteins can be broadly classified as transmembrane or peripheral membrane proteins, with the latter requiring acylation for stable membrane binding. teomic profiling of modified proteins has revealed the diverse nature of the modified proteins. acylation of NH2 or COOH terminus or soluble loops may control membrane association of the protein. dual lipidation is required for membrane association including prenylation or myristoylation at sites close to the S-acylated cysteine residue. acylation is a highly conserved process occurring in all eukaryotic organisms that have been examined. classically, S-acylation dynamics have been studied using radiolabeling with [3H]palmitic acid, which is converted into [3H]palmitoyl-CoA in cells. early studies that employed [3H]palmitate pulse-chase experiments highlighted the reversibility of S-acylation. a major outstanding question in S-acylation research relates to how the dynamics of lipid turnover on S-acylated proteins is regulated. palmitate (C16:0) is indeed the major lipid incorporated into endogenous S-acylated proteins, although other fatty acids such as stearate (C18:0) and oleate (C18:1) can also be added. the study described above used gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to quantify the levels of individual lipids on platelet proteins. however, this approach is not able to determine the exact cysteine residues that are modified by the detected fatty acids. however, tandem mass spectrometry approaches have proven useful to profile the lipid species that are attached to specific cysteine residues. transmembrane proteins that are modified by S-acylation are equally as diverse in nature as the S-acylated peripheral membrane proteins. S-acylation may allow a cytosolic NH2 or COOH terminus to associate with the membrane interface. S-acylation regulates multiple steps in membrane and peripheral membrane protein life cycle. different zDHHCs have been reported to be resident on these distinct membranes. the first and foremost function of S-acylation is to mediate stable membrane attachment (215) myristoyl and prenyl transferases mediate the co- and posttranslational modification of soluble proteins, respectively, are localized in the cell cytosol (5, 26, 125, 254) the enzymes that mediate S-acylation are exclusively membrane-associated, and as a result, this modification only occurs at cellular membranes. this concept is readily observed in model membrane systems composed of ternary lipid mixtures. cholesterol and saturated phospholipids phase separate from unsaturated phospholipids. this phase separation occurs in vitro, leading to the formation of cholesterol- and saturated phospholipid-rich microdomains. protein S-acylation appears to be an important factor in targeting proteins to specific ER subdomains. calnexin is S-acylated at the cytoplasmic side of its single transmembrane domain. a role for S-acylation has also emerged in targeting of proteins to the mitochondrial-associated membrane (MAM) acylation-dependent movement of proteins from the cytosol to membranes may allow other domains of the protein to interact with sorting adaptors. in this scenario, S-acylation is required for protein trafficking (by virtue of the requirement of this modification for membrane association) but it does not actively direct proteins to a specific intracellular compartment. mutant SNAP25 proteins with three rather than four S-acylation acceptor sites exhibited a marked accumulation on endosomal membranes. the number of acylation acceptor sites in SNAP25 has a marked effect on association of the protein with cholesterol-rich membranes. mutated were retained at the ER and failed to traffic to the plasma membrane. this block in forward trafficking of S-acylation-deficient mutants was alleviated. authors proposed that nonacylated LRP6 is trapped at the ER because hydrophobic mismatching occurs between the long TMD (23 amino acids) and the thin ER bilayer. this modification regulates movement of proteins between the plasma membrane and endosomes. it is difficult to find a consensus model to predict, for a specific protein, how S-acylation might modulate trafficking between the plasma membrane and endosomes. blocking S-acylation interfered with trafficking of Sortillin back to the Golgi complex. mutants of Sortillin appear to be more susceptible to ubquitination. interplay between S-acylation and ubiquitination was reported for yeast SNARE protein Tlg1 (257) limited number of proteomic analyses performed to-date in mice with reduced expression of zDHHC enzymes have also noted that reduced S-acylation levels of specific proteins often correlate with an overall loss of expression. careful proteomic assessment of how S-acylation affects the expression levels of the cellular proteome will provide a detailed understanding of how widespread the link between S-acylation and protein stability is. zDHHC13 Point mutation, truncation in protein, and reduced expression Reduced life-span, reduction in size, osteoporosis, muscle wasting, widespread amyloid deposition, reduction in adipose mass, hyperkeratosis, kyphosis, loose skin, active hair follicles reduced, lymphocytopenia, neutrophilia, serum levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransfer zDHHC5 knockout mice exhibit behavioral abnormalities including changes in prepulse inhibition and in exploratory behavior. deficits may be caused by changes in the formation/stability of excitatory synapses and perturbations in dendritic growth (171). zDHHC17 and zDHHC13 genetrap mice also exhibit behavioral deficits and changes in neuronal function. zDHHC13 genetrap mice exhibit a broadly similar neuropathology to zDHHC17 genetrap mice (240). zDHHC13 mutant mice exhibit a broadly similar neuropathology to zDHHC17 genetrap mice (240). zDHHC13 mutant mice exhibit a reduced life-span, systemic amyloidosis, osteoporosis, and muscle wasting (216). zDHHC mutant mice will hopefully include an analysis of knock-in mutants. this will be an important step to resolve effects arising due to a loss of S-acylation activity of the zDHHC enzymes from other noncanonical functions of the zDHHC proteins. zDHHC17 zDHHC13 and zDHHC17 enzymes mediate S-acylation of huntingtin (HTT) protein. HTT also regulates enzymatic activity of zDHHC17. no clinical evidence linking zDHHC13 or zDHHC17 with HD 106, 230, 240, 273 zDHHC13. mutations in the PPT1 gene cause infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL), an early-onset neurodegenerative lysosomal-storage disease. zDHHC11 gene is present within a region of chromosome 5 that has increased copy number in lung and bladder cancers. zDHHC2 has been reported to be downregulated in colorectal cancers. single myristoyl or prenyl groups only provide peptides with a weak membrane affinity, sufficient for transient membrane binding. kinetic trapping observed when peptides convert from having a single lipid group to being dual lipidated is highly relevant when one considers the intracellular distribution of lipidating enzymes. mutation of the S-acylation site(s) in Ras proteins leads to a weak association with membranes. mutation of the farnesylation signal leads to a loss of both S-acylation and membrane binding. this mechanism of initial membrane interaction has been proposed to operate for SNAP25 and CSP (77, 78) S-acylation-dependent association of proteins with detergent-insoluble rafts has been proposed to regulate important cellular pathways. the majority of work on membrane microdomains has focused on proteins associated with the plasma membrane; however, intracellular compartments also exhibit heterogeneities in structure and composition. transmembrane thioredoxin family protein TMX and heme oxygenase-1 were found to require S-acylation for efficient targeting to the MAM (150) this study also suggested that S-acylation of calnexin was required for efficient targeting to the MAM (150), and thus more work is clearly required in this area. cholesterol-rich domains at the Golgi have been proposed to act as platforms for transport vesicles delivering cargo to the plasma membrane (188). thus S-acylation might promote Golgi exit by driving protein association with such cholesterol-rich microdomains. signal peptides and start/stop transfer sequences are employed to insert transmembrane proteins into the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) several chaperones and enzymes in the ER lumen facilitate protein folding, catalyze modifications, and support oligomeric assembly of proteins into the necessary quaternary structure. a similar role for S-acylation in regulating ER exit was described for the yeast chitin synthase Chs3 protein. blocking S-acylation was found to promote aggregation and ER retention. a similar role for acylation in hydrophobic matching was proposed 133. this was observed for MUC1 containing cysteine-to-alanine mutations at the transmembrane boundary that block S-acylation. the mutant protein displayed reduced coimmunoprecipitation with the adaptor protein AP1 which regulates vesicle formation at recycling endosomes. there is also evidence that this modification can regulate recycling of proteins from endosomes back to the plasma membrane. a similar interplay between S-acylation and ubiquitination has been identified. the effect of S-acylation to restrict raft association of TEM8 is in contrast to the raft-targeting activity of this modification on many other proteins. calnexin is enriched in ribosome-translocon complexes. hepatosplenomegaly 216 zDHHC13 Genetrap insertion at intron 1 Hypoactivity, trend towards reduced body weight, hypotrichosis, alopecia around eyes, reduction in hair follicles. impairment in motor learning, motor deficits in climbing, reduced volume in multiple brain regions in adults. reduced body weight, hyperactive in open-field test, decreased prepulse inhibition, decreased volume in striatum, cerebral cortex, hippocampus and white matter. zDHHC17 genetrap mice exhibit decreased striatal volume and a loss of medium spiny neurons. zDHHC17 genetrap mice exhibit a partial loss of SNAP25 and PSD95 S-acylation (230) zDHHC13 genetrap mice exhibit a broadly similar neuropathology to zDHHC17 genetrap mice (240). mice exhibit reduced life-span, systemic amyloidosis, osteoporosis, and muscle wasting (216) no HD-like phenotype was seen in this zDHHC13 mouse model. a mouse line with a point mutation in the zdhhc21 gene exhibits hair loss and skin abnormalities (163) mutations have been shown to affect enzyme autoacylation (a measure of activity) in in vitro assays. this provides strong evidence that intellectual disability can arise due to a deficit in the S-acylation of specific substrates of zDHHC9. it will therefore be important in future work to identify proteins that have reduced S-acylation following inactivation of the zDHHC9 enzyme. zDHHC11 expression increased in colorectal tumors; zDHHC14 expression decreased in testicular germ cell tumors and prostate cancer. zDHHC14 expression decreased in testicular germ cell tumors and prostate cancer and increased in gastric cancer and leukemia. zDHHC2 has been reported to be downregulated in colorectal cancers (186) and also in gastric adenocarcinoma (272) zDHHC14 expression is downregulated in testicular germ cell tumors and prostate cancer (280) zDHHC14 expression was seen in gastric cancer and leukemia (11, 283), suggesting that this protein actually might be oncogenic in certain settings. the majority of zDHHC proteins are bona fide S-acyl transferases (74, 109) but other acylation-independent functions have also been ascribed to some members of the family. zDHHC family members characterized to date are predicted polytopic membrane proteins with the catalytic DHHC domain facing the cytosol. ase Chs3 (133), and Swf1p deletion blocked S-acylation of the SNARE protein Tlg1p (257) also, S-acylation of Tlg1 was not rescued by high level expression of three other yeast zDHHC proteins. zDHHC enzymes are required for the S-acylation of different sites on the same protein. zDHHC3 is highly active against SNAP23. transplanting the DHHC domain from this protein into an inactive enzyme (zDHHC15) did not allow zDHHC15 to acylate SNAP23 (75) instead, zDHHC enzyme activity likely requires the coordinated activities of the DHHC domain and other regions of the enzyme. a proline residue 25 amino acids downstream of the acylated cysteine-rich domain of SNAP25 is required for modification by zDHHC17 but not by zDHHC3. a phenylalanine residue within the cysteine cluster is required for S-acylation of the SNAP25b isoform by DHHC15 (75) acylation of flotillin-1 and -2 was reduced by 36%. further analysis of global S-acylation in zDHHC knockout mice will provide invaluable data on the substrates of individual DHHC proteins. palmitoyl thioesterase 1 (PPT1) and acyl protein thioesterase 1 (APTI) are targeted to lysosomes and catalyze deacylation during protein degradation. acyl protein thioesterase 1 (APTI) is a cytoplasmic enzyme implicated in dynamic S-acylation cycling of proteins (48) this is highlighted by a recent study that reported the blockade of deacylation of R7BP (a regulator of G protein signaling) by the general serine hydrolase inhibitors palmostatin B and HDFP (115). this led to a redistribution of the protein from the plasma membrane onto endomembrane compartments (115). this led to a redistribution of the protein from the plasma membrane onto endomembrane compartments (115). palmitate is attached via an amide linkage to the NH2-terminal cysteine of hedgehog. ghrelin O-acyltransferase transfers an O-octanoyl group onto a conserved serine residue of the peptide hormone ghrelin (275). there is a major interest in targeting the abnormal hedgehog signaling that is present in a high percentage of pancreatic and other cancer types via chemical inhibitors of Hhat (243). zDHHC17 complex immunoprecipitated from rat brain showed acyltransferase activity towards recombinant SNAP25 (106) depletion of HTT led to a reduction of zDHHC17 S-acylation and a corresponding reduction in S-acylation of SNAP25 and GluR1 (106). zDHHC2 mediates activity-dependent S-acylation of PSD95. micro-RNAs have been shown to regulate expression of both zDHHC enzymes and thioesterases. zDHHC5 activity is likely to be regulated via expression changes in response to specific extracellular cues (139) micro-RNAs have been shown to regulate expression of both zDHHC enzymes and thioesterases. a similar role for prolyl isomerases has been suggested in the regulation of Rac1 S-acylation. pharmacological inhibition of prolyl isomerase activity (FK508) or mutation of proline residues adjacent to the acylation site increased incorporation of [3H]palmitate into Rac1. several studies have shown changes in protein S-acylation following cell treatment with nitric oxide donors (10, 13, 97) however, as intracellular diffusion of NO is limited, physiologically relevant protein nitrosylation might be limited to substrates in close proximity to NO synthase. a recent study highlighted mutually competitive effects of S-acylation and S-nitrosylation on Cys-3 and Cys-5 of PSD95. mass spectrometry analysis revealed that H-Ras from treated endothelial cells was S-glutathiolated on either Cys181 or Cys184 following metabolic stress. biggest breakthrough in the S-acylation field in recent years was the discovery of the enzymes that control this process. all zDHHC family members characterized to date are predicted polytopic membrane proteins with the catalytic DHHC domain facing the cytosol. the majority of zDHHC proteins are localized to ER and Golgi membranes, with a small number present on post-Golgi compartments (182). at present, there is little information available on intramolecular signals that specify intracellular localization. zDHHC-substrate specificity is an element of zDHHC enzymes acting on overlapping substrates (74) however, superimposed upon this zDHHC-substrate specificity is an element of zDHHC enzymes acting on overlapping substrates (74) zDHHC enzyme activity likely requires coordinated activities of the DHHC domain and other regions of the enzyme. 2 terminus of zDHHC3 led to the S-acylation of zDHHC17 substrates. zDHHC3 also contains ankyrin-repeat extension. a PDZ ligand in the COOH terminus of zDHHC5/zDHHC8 regulates binding to and S-acylation of GRIP1b, an adaptor protein containing multiple PDZ domains. analysis of zDHHC-substrate specificity has been undertaken in S. cerevisiae (212) but we currently lack detailed information on the effects of knockdown of specific zDHHC enzymes on global S-acylation. the ability of different \u201ccompeting\u201d lipids to block [3H]palmitate incorporation into zDHHC2 and zDHHC3 was compared (112) zDHHC2 transferred C18:0, C18:1 and C20:4 lipids to a model substrate protein. zDHHC3 strongly favored C14/C16 lipids over C18/C20 lipids (112) a related protein, APT2, has been reported to function as a thioesterase against GAP43 and H-Ras but not BK potassium channels (249, 251) an additional protein, APT1-like thioesterase, has activity against BK potassium channels (249, 251) research into the role of APT proteins in dynamic S-acylation has been supported by the recent development of thioesterase inhibitors. several secreted proteins are modified by different types of acylation that are critical for signaling functions. acylation occurs on the luminal side of intracellular membranes. acylation occurs on the luminal side of intracellular membranes. in a high percentage of pancreatic and other cancer types via chemical inhibitors of Hhat 243. cholesterylation and palmitoylation are essential for the biological activity of hedgehog. novel small molecule inhibitors Hhat (195) successfully block proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells. zDHHC2, which mediates activity-dependent S-acylation of PSD95, is regulated by dynamic changes in its localization. blocking synaptic activity, which leads to enhanced S-acylation of PSD95, also modulates zDHHC2 trafficking (179), promoting its accumulation at the plasma membrane. miR-138 and miR-134 appear to respond differently to neuronal activity. regulation of substrate S-acylation can also occur independently of direct effects on zDHHC or APT enzymes. prolyl isomerase action leads to increased accessibility of the S-acylated cysteines to thioesterase enzymes. a recent study highlighted mutually competitive effects of S-acylation and S-nitrosylation on Cys-3 and Cys-5 of PSD95. PSD-95 acts as a scaffold to link Ca2+ influx through NMDA channels to activation of nNOS activity (18, 218) physiological production of NO was shown to lead to S-nitrosylation of Cys3/Cys5 and a decrease in PSD95 S-acylation and subsequent synaptic clustering. depletion of zDHHC8, which was reported to S-acylate PSD95 (171), led to an increase in PSD95 nitrosylation (10 pharmacological, proteomic, and genetic tools to investigate the functional role of S-acylation remain somewhat limited. there is a real need, and opportunity, to develop improved tools to interrogate and manipulate S-acylation to develop our understanding of the physiological function of this PTM in health and disease. alternative labels have now been developed including a variety of bioorthogonal lipid probes. fluorescent imaging and protein purification assays are modified fatty acids. a range of fluorophores or protein capture reagents can then be conjugated to the reactive group. development of a family of -alkynyl fatty acid probes of different chain lengths have been exploited for proteomic profiling. a number of related approaches have been developed that exploit the exposure of a reactive cysteine following hydroxylamine cleavage (at neutral pH) of the cysteine-acyl thioester linkage. the newly exposed cysteine thiol can react with cysteine-reactive groups such as biotin-BMCC or biotin-HPDP used in the ABE approach (43\u201345, 265). tools widely available for other PTMs such as phosphospecific antibodies are not available in the S-acylation field. a recent novel approach has been the exploitation of an intrabody that recognizes the S-acylation-induced conformational changes in the scaffolding protein PSD-95, rather than S-acylation per se. the development of novel S-acylation inhibitors and activators would represent a substantial advance for investigation of S-acylation. overexpression studies have exploited expression of candidate zDHHCs and their catalytically \u201cdead\u201d DHHS mutants, in heterologous expression or native systems. zDHHC23 mRNA expression is upregulated by zDHHC23 mRNA expression (249) the lack of high-quality antibodies for western blotting and immunocytochemistry for most zDHHCs is an important caveat. a range of alternative metabolic labeling approaches and indirect assays of cysteine accessibility are complimentary approaches. alternative labels have been developed including a variety of bioorthogonal lipid probes. the commercially available 17-octadecynoic acid (17-ODYA) labels are modified fatty acids, with chemical reactive groups incorporated into S-acylated proteins by the zDHHC enzymes. acyl-biotin exchange (ABE) and resin-assisted capture (Acyl-RAC) assays exploit the exposure of a reactive cysteine following hydroxylamine cleavage (at neutral pH) of the cysteine-acyl thioester linkage. the newly exposed cysteine thiol can react with cysteine-reactive groups (such as biotin-BMCC or biotin-HPDP) the lipid- and cysteine-centric assays have provided substantial insight into the diversity of proteins that are S-acylated. however, mass spectrometry-based approaches to identify the native lipid specifically bound to S-acylated cysteine remain a significant challenge. development of a family of -alkynyl fatty acid probes have been exploited for proteomic profiling as well as single-cell imaging with improved sensitivity. in all these metabolic labeling assays, it is essential to discriminate incorporation via S-acylation. most common method to discriminate S-acylation is to use hydroxylamine cleavage (at neutral pH of the lipid) ine thiol can react with cysteine-reactive groups such as biotin-BMCC or biotin-HPDP. these assays do not determine the nature of the bound lipid, rather the presence of a cysteine with a cleavable thioester linkage. these approaches have been exploited to determine the \u201cS-acylated proteome\u201d in a number of species and tissues. the pharmacological toolkit to manipulate S-acylation in vivo and in vivo remains very limited. palmitate analog 2-bromopalmitate (2-BP) is our best pharmacological inhibitor of zDHHCs (207, 289) acylthioesterases is a nonselective inhibitor of lipid metabolism. acylation inhibitors and activators that display both specificity and zDHHC selectivity would represent a substantial advance for investigation of S-acylation. overexpression studies have predominantly exploited expression of candidate zDHHCs and their catalytically \u201cdead\u201d DHHS mutants. overexpression can result in S-acylation of cysteine residue(s) that are not endogenously S-acylated in native cells. trap and global as well as conditional knockout models are becoming available, although full phenotypic analysis is limited in most cases. similar overexpression and knockdown approaches have also started to be exploited to interrogate APT function. odopsin was shown to be S-acylated more than 30 years ago (180, 185) the majority of G protein-coupled receptors examined have been shown to be S-acylated at typically one, two, or three residues in the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic tail following the last transmembrane domain. notable exceptions include the GnRH receptor and a thromboxane variant that lack the conserved cysteine residues. the 2-adrenergic receptor C341G mutant is less efficient at stimulating adenylate cyclase activity than the wild-type protein (181) this effect is due to the C341G mutant being hyperphosphorylated by PKA and thus resembling a desensitized receptor. agonists can also modify the S-acylation status of GPCRs (148) S-acylation controls Gq shuttling between the Golgi, where Gq is S-acylated, and the plasma membrane with inhibition of Gq S-acylation blocking 1-adrenergic signaling through Gq (255). members of the GPCR kinase (GRK) family are also S-acylated. p63RhoGEF targets a conserved cluster of cysteine residues (C23, 25, and 26) in the NH2-terminal domain. this constitutive targeting promotes basal activity of p63RhoGEF. mutation of the S-acylated cysteines reduces activity and relocalizes it to the cytoplasm. deacylation of ER promotes ER degradation and abrogates estrogen-induced gene transcription. the in vivo roles of PR and AR S-acylation remain to be explored. the in vivo roles of PR and AR S-acylation remain to be explored. vesicle trafficking, exocytosis, and endocytosis are fundamental mechanisms for controlling bulk trafficking of proteins in cells and the control of intercellular communication through the release of hormones and neurotransmitters. the endosomal syntaxin 7 is important for trafficking between endosomal and plasma membranes as its S-acylated at a cysteine residue (C239) juxtaposed to its single transmembrane domain. syntaxin 11, which lacks a transmembrane domain, reveals important role for S-acylation in membrane targeting and localization of syntaxin 11 to the immunological synapse in natural killer (NK) cells. syntaxin 11 is S-acylated at a cluster of cysteine residues at the COOH terminus of the protein, a region that is lost due to frameshift mutations. a code to specify the precise subcellular distribution in the recycling pathway between recycling endosomes, the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and the plasma membrane (73). mutation of any individual S-acylated cysteine to leucine enhanced SNAP25 localization at recycling endosomes and the TGN although mutation of either C88 or C90 had the greatest effect. oligomerization of mutant CSP can also occur in the absence of S-acylation (286), suggesting that CSP S-acylation of these mutants is a major driver of the onset of this disease and aggregate formation. vesicles isolated from embryonic brains did not. wild-type SytVII was correctly targeted to lysozomes where it is assembled with the tetraspanin CD63. S-acylation-deficient mutants localized at the Golgi and did not assemble with CD63. microtubule-mediated trafficking S-acylation has also been implicated in the control of dynein-dependent motor protein function. endocytosis of transmembrane proteins may occur through clathrin-dependent pathway. clathrin-independent endocytosis may occur through clathrin-dependent partitioning of protein into cholesterol-rich lipid raft microdomains. reoxygenation of cardiac myocytes initiates MEND. acyl-CoA provides unlimited supply of acyl-CoA for zDHHC enzymes. increased S-acylation of such proteins is then hypothesized to result in clustering and association of these proteins in ordered lipid raft domains. knockdown of zDHHC5 in cardiac myocytes largely prevented MEND. hypomorphic zDHHC5 mice retained ventricular function following ischemia. ion channels are regulated by S-acylation of pore-forming subunits and regulatory subunits that control channel trafficking and function. two exemplars from the ligand-gated and voltage gated ion channel families will be discussed. a single cysteine residue in GluA1 is located adjacent to a cytosolic hydrophobic segment between two transmembrane domains. the pore-forming subunit of BK channels encoded by the single gene KCNMA1 is again S-acylated at two sites. first, S-acylation of a cluster of cysteine residues (C53 and C56) in a cytosolic loop between the first two transmembrane domains is required for efficient trafficking of the BK channel from the ER to Golgi and subsequently the cell surface. another AMPAR interacting protein, Grip1b, accelerates local recycling of AMPAR to the plasma membrane in dendritic spines through interaction of S-acylated Grip1b with dendritic trafficking vesicles. a recent intriguing study has also revealed a role for S-acylation in controlling trafficking of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) wild-type CFTR and the F508del mutant are S-acylated, with zDHHCs 3 and 7 likely candidates. mutant CFTR S-acylation promotes biogenesis of core-glycosylated CFTR promoting trafficking of both wild-type and F508del mutant channels. chronic inhibition, or site-directed mutagenesis of C580 to serine, resulted in enhanced receptor degradation and enhanced protein kinase C-dependent downregulation of transporter function (57). the ATP-binding cassette transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1 are both found at the plasma membrane, where they transport cholesterol out of the cell to apolipoprotein A1. the apolipoproteins are also S-acylated and ApoB at C1085 is important for its intracellular sorting and formation of LDL (288). if dysregulation of ABC transporter S-acylation is associated with disruption of cholesterol transport in a range of disorders including atherosclerosis, macular degeneration, and some cancers remains to be determined. Glut4 translocation impairs insulin-induced Glut4 translocation to the plasma membrane. Phospholemman is a transmembrane protein that is a major regulatory subunit of the sodium pump (Na+-K+-ATPase) function in cardiac cells. de-acylated PLSRC1 is targeted to the nucleus where it can bind DNA and activate transcriptional cascades. the ability of S-acylation to act as a switch of PLSCR1 function is important following the rapid upregulation of PLSCR1 expression following exposure to cytokines. PSD-95 is the most abundant scaffolding protein in the postsynaptic density of glutamatergic chemical synapses. it coordinates the assembly of a variety of ligand-gated ion channels. it is S-acylated at its NH2 terminus on two residues by multiple zDHHC enzymes including zDHHC2. Knockdown of zDHHC5 and 8, or site-directed mutagenesis of the Ankyrin-G cysteine, mimics the effect of knockout itself, preventing lateral membrane assembly. this mechanism is also dependent on phospholipid interactions with II-spectrin, which binds to Ankyrin-G. AKAP79/150 mutants that lack the S-acylation site do not support AMPAR trafficking and synaptic potentiation in vitro. transmembrane adapter proteins (TRAPs) represent a large and diverse family of proteins that can coordinate signal transduction modules at the plasma membrane. calnexin is a transmembrane chaperone localized in the endoplasmic reticulum. it facilitates the folding of nascent chains of glycosylated proteins. calnexin plays a role in ER calcium content and regulation of calcium signaling between the ER and mitochondria required for control of mitochondrial membrane potential. inhibition of zDHHC6 or mutation of the calnexin S-acylated cysteines disrupts glycoprotein folding. at the MAM, calnexin assembles with the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-transport ATPase 2b (SERCA2b) and reduces mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake from the ER (151) de-acylation of calnexin prevents its association with SERCA2b with subsequent a number of histone H3 variants are S-acylated, with the conserved cysteine C110 being a major site of S-acylation. the functional impact of H3 S-acylation has yet to be fully established, although the localization of H3 to the nuclear shell fraction in HeLa cells may support a role in perinuclear tethering of chromatin. tyrosine kinases are members of the Src family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases (SFK) implicated in a wide diversity of signaling responses including cell proliferation, changes in cell morphology and migration. tyrosine kinases are cotranslationally myristoylated at glycine residue 2 but are differentially S-acylated at cysteine residues immediately downstream of the myristoylated g SFKs that may be singly S-acylated, such as Lyn and Yes, are S-acylated in the Golgi apparatus. if Lyn or Yes is not S-acylated, they remain largely in the Golgi apparatus due to their myristoylation. zDHHC3 and 7 S-acylate multiple cysteines in the 173CCPCC motif within the catalytic core of PI4KII. Mutation of these cysteines also significantly reduces PI4P kinase activity and consequently Golgi PI4P levels. de-acylated Rac1 shows reduced GTP loading and increased oligomerization, with reduced activation of its downstream effector PAK kinase leading to defects in cell spreading and migration. a brain-specific COOH-terminal splice variant replaces the COOH-terminal prenylation motif to a sequence with a di-cysteine motif (-CCAX) just downstream of the COOH terminus. bCdc42 does not interact with RhoGDI, thus promoting the amount of bCdc42 at the plasma membrane and potentiating bCdc42 signaling. other enzymes superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) is a ubiquitously expressed protein that protects cells from oxidative damage. eNOS is dually myristoylated and S-acylated (C15 and C26) largely through zDHHC21 in endothelial cells. inhibition of eNOS S-acylation abrogates both basal and stimulated NO synthesis in endothelial cells. longer PDE10A2 variant is predominantly membrane localized, including at postsynaptic membranes, that is controlled by S-acylation of C11. the shorter PDE10A1 variant lacks C11, has a cytosolic localization and reduced trafficking to distal dendrites. two subunits of -secretase, Nicastrin and APH-1, are S-acylated with Nicastrin S-acylated at a single site (C689), whereas APH-1 is S-acylated at two sites (C182 and C245) this suggests the role of S-acylation is to protect the two nascent subunits from degradation until assembly into the complex (35). neurofascin is a member of the L1 family of cell adhesion proteins. neurofascin is S-acylated at a conserved cysteine residue (C1213) in the predicted membrane spanning domains. S-acylation also plays a complex role in controlling the formation of membrane microdomains enriched for tetraspanins. in neuroblastoma cells, the two major NCAM isoforms NCAM140 and NCAM180 are S-acylated. this can be stimulated by FGF2-mediated signaling through the FGF receptor (197). Deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC) is homologous to neuronal cell adhesion molecules (NCAM) and is a receptor for the guidance molecule netrin-1. PECAM1 is implicated in a diverse array of endothelial functions. but cell adhesion molecule function may also be controlled by other S-acylated proteins they interact with. a recent example is the activity-dependent control of synaptic cadherin complexes by its S-acylated binding partner -catenin. several classes of viral proteins have been shown to be S-acylated. the role of S-acylation is not fully understood in many cases. most viral proteins do not appear to undergo cycles of S-acylation and de-acylation. the major cause of mortality in malaria infection, Plasmodium falciparum, expresses a large (>400) compliment of S-acylated proteins. several of these proteins are involved in controlling the actin-myosin machinery required for these organisms to invade red blood cells of infected individuals. rhodopsin was shown to be S-acylated more than 30 years ago. the large majority of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) examined have been shown to be S-acylated at typically one, two, or three residues in the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic tail. notable exceptions include the GnRH receptor and a thromboxane variant that lack the conserved cysteine residues. efficient coupling between agonist binding and G protein activation is reported for several, but not all, GPCRs. the 2-adrenergic receptor C341G mutant is less efficient at stimulating adenylate cyclase activity than the wild-type protein (181) this effect is due to the C341G mutant being hyperphosphorylated by PKA. zDHHC3 and 7 overexpression robustly S-acylated Gq, Gs, and Gi subunits expressed in HEK293 cells. S-acylation controls Gq shuttling between the Golgi, where Gq is S-acylated, and the plasma membrane with inhibition of Gq S-acylation blocking 1-adrenergic signaling through Gq. p63RhoGEF targets a conserved cluster of cysteine residues (C23, 25, and 26) in the NH2-terminal domain. this constitutive targeting promotes basal activity of p63RhoGEF as mutation of the S-acylated cysteines reduces activity and relocalizes it to the cytoplasm. steroid receptors exist predominantly in the nucleus where they mediate both ligand-dependent and -independent deacylation of ER promotes ER degradation and abrogates estrogen-induced gene transcription. in vivo roles of PR and AR S-acylation remain to be explored. olae through S-acylation of two cysteine residues C254 and C255 in osteoblasts. p30 TR1 is essential for the nongenomic actions of thyroid hormone. this novel receptor is required for the rapid nongenomic signaling of thyroid hormone. rhodopsin is required for correct maturation in the ER, subsequent trafficking to the plasma membrane, and targeting to \u201clipid raft\u201d domains for several, but not all, GPCRs. epinephrine stimulation of the 2-adrenoreceptor through Gs proteins to activate adenylate cyclase is reported for several, but not all, GPCRs. agonists can modify the S-acylation status of GPCRs (148), and S-acylation controls receptor desensitization and internalization. the G subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins themselves are S-acylated, and S-acylation is required for plasma membrane localization (37, 201). membrane targeting of RGS-R7 is controlled through assembly with an S-acylated R7 binding protein (R7-BP), that acts as an allosteric activator, to control G protein-coupled potassium channel activity (115). in neurons, R7-BP S-acylation is increased upon activation of Gi-linked GPCRs through slowing of deacylation R7-BP. a significant fraction of the receptor may be localized at the plasma membrane where they can mediate nongenomic steroid signaling cascades. the membrane-targeted fraction of these receptors is S-acylated, at a single cysteine residue, in the ligand binding domain of the receptor (191) by zDHHCs 7 and 21 (189) p30 TR1 is a novel membrane TH receptor that lacks the conserved cysteine residue seen in the ER and other steroid receptors above (119). this receptor is unable to stimulate transcriptional but is instead targeted to caveolae through S-acylation of two cysteine residues C254 and C255 in osteoblasts. this novel receptor is required for the rapid nongenomic signaling of thyroid hormone. multiple members of the syntaxin family have been reported to be S-acylated. the endosomal syntaxin 7, S-acylated at a cysteine residue (C239) juxtaposed to its single transmembrane domain, is important for trafficking between endosomal and plasma membranes. atypical syntaxin, syntaxin 11, lacks a transmembrane domain. SNAP23, are both peripheral membrane proteins that interact with membranes through S-acylation of multiple cysteines in cysteine-rich domains of the proteins. the number of cysteine residues of SNAP25 that are S-acylated appears to act as a code to specify the precise subcellular distribution in the recycling pathway between recycling endosomes and the plasma membrane (73). mutations in a core cysteine-rich domain result in aggregation of CSP. mutations mistarget CSP resulting in aggregates of mutant CSP. oligomerization of mutant CSP can also occur in absence of S-acylation. synaptotagmin VII (Syt VII) is an example of a more broadly expressed synaptotagmin that is localized to lysozomes. phagocytosis, which is dependent on lysosomal membrane delivery to the cell surface, is disrupted. microtubule-mediated trafficking S-acylation has also been implicated in the control of dynein-dependent motor protein function. the effect of S-acylation is divergent between Ndel1 and its paralog Nde1. for Ndel1, S-acylation reduces the ability of Ndel1 to interact with cytoplasmic dynein that results in reduced dynein activity. in contrast, S-acylation of Nde1 does not significantly affect dynein activity or function. reoxygenation of cardiac myocytes initiates MEND, a process proposed to result from formation of permeability transition pores in the mitochondrial membrane. the release of coenzyme A results in rapid increase in acyl-CoA providing unlimited supply of acyl-CoA for zDHHC enzymes. syntaxin 11 lacks a transmembrane domain, which is important for trafficking between endosomal and plasma membranes. syntaxin 11 is S-acylated at a cluster of cysteine residues at the COOH terminus of the protein, a region that is lost due to frameshift mutations. SNAP25 plays a role in both synaptic and endosomal membrane fusion events. its targeting to membranes is controlled by S-acylation of a cluster of four cysteine residues. the number of cysteine residues of SNAP25 that are S-acylated appears to act as a code to specify the precise subcellular distribution in the recycling pathway between recycling endosomes. Cysteine string protein (CSP) is a ubiquitously expressed DnaJ chaperone protein. it regulates secretory vesicle dynamics likely by stabilizing multiple synaptic proteins including SNAP25. mutations in this cysteine-rich domain result in aggregation of CSP. synaptotagmin1 S-acylation is enhanced by inhibiting synaptic activity. mutation of the S-acylated cysteines results in enhanced surface expression and diffuse localization rather than punctate localization to presynaptic membranes. phagocytosis is disrupted, and this could be restored by overexpression of wild-type but not S-acylation-deficient mutants. Ndel1 and Nde1 are S-acylated, with zDHHCs 2, 3 and 7 the major candidates. in both proteins conserved C273 in the Ndel1 dynein binding domain appears to be the major residue. but the effect of S-acylation is divergent between Ndel1 and its paralog Nde1. is of such ordered plasma membranes has been described to be, in part, triggered by S-acylation in cardiac myocytes and other cells. the process is proposed to result from formation of permeability transition pores in the mitochondrial membrane resulting in release of coenzyme A into the cytoplasm. the increased S-acylation of such proteins is then hypothesized to result in clustering and association of these proteins in ordered lipid raft domains. ion channels Since the discovery of the first S-acylated ion channels more than 25 years ago, more than 50 different ion channel subunits have been reported to be S-acylated. ion channels are regulated by S-acylation of pore-forming subunits as well as an array of regulatory subunits that control channel trafficking and function. gluA1 is located adjacent to a cytosolic hydrophobic segment between two transmembrane domains. a cluster of cysteine residues in the cytosolic COOH terminus of GluA1 promotes retention of AMPAR at the Golgi apparatus (86). this regulation of PKC phosphorylation prevents GluA1 binding to its cytoskeletal adapter protein 4.1N and reducing AMPAR insertion. the distinct sites of S-acylation appear to be under control of distinct members of the zDHHC family. in both AMPAR and BK channels, the distinct sites of S-acylation appear to be under control of distinct members of the zDHHC family. a recent intriguing study has also revealed a role for S-acylation in controlling trafficking of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) CFTR is a chloride and bicarbonate channel that is central to the pathogenesis of the enhanced mucus lining the lung in cystic fibrosis (159). both wild-type CFTR and the F508del mutant are S-acylated. dopamine transporters are targets for both therapeutic drugs and drugs of abuse. the ATP-binding cassette transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1 are both found at the plasma membrane. they transport cholesterol out of the cell to apolipoprotein A1 and subsequent formation of high-density lipoprotein (79, 231) a dicysteine motif (C1110 and C1111) in the large intracellular linker between transmembrane domains 6 and 7 suggests the cysteine residues play similar functions. ABCA1 is S-acylated by multiple zDHHCs, although zDHHC8 shows the most robust S-acylation in overexpression assays. clipR-59 acts as a scaffold to drive phosphorylation of the Rab GTPase activating protein AS160 that is also S-acylated (206) by the protein kinase Akt to drive insulin-dependent recruitment of Glut4 to the plasma membrane. zDHHC17 prevents ClipR-59 and Akt recruitment to the plasma membrane and impairs insulin-induced Glut4 translocation to the plasma membrane. PLSCR1 is a calcium-binding protein that controls phospholipid transfer across the plasma membrane. de-acylated PLSRC1 is targeted to the nucleus where it can bind DNA and activate transcriptional cascades. in this case to the mitochondrion, rather than the nucleus. ion channels Since the discovery of the first S-acylated ion channels more than 25 years ago, more than 50 different ion channel subunits have been reported to be S-acylated. ion channels are regulated by S-acylation of pore-forming subunits as well as an array of regulatory subunits that control channel trafficking and function. a cluster of cysteine residues in the cytosolic COOH terminus of GluA1 is located adjacent to a cytosolic hydrophobic segment between the first two transmembrane domains. in contrast, S-acylation of a cluster of cysteine residues in the cytosolic COOH terminus of GluA1 blocks phosphorylation of GluA1 likely through a mechanism of steric hindrance (142) distinct sites of S-acylation appear to be under control of distinct members of the zDHHC family. in both AMPAR and BK channels, the distinct sites of S-acylation appear to be under control of distinct members of the zDHHC family. the diversity of effects of S-acylation on channel function is illustrated in these two channel types through S-acylation of distinct regulatory subunits and adapter proteins. a recent study has also revealed a role for S-acylation in controlling trafficking of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) CFTR is a chloride and bicarbonate channel that is central to the pathogenesis of the enhanced mucus lining the lung in cystic fibrosis (159). both wild-type and the F508del mutant are S-acylated. dopamine transport is essential in controlling synaptic levels of dopamine. acute pharmacological inhibition of S-acylation reduced transporter V0.5max in synaptosomes without affecting transporter expression or surface membrane expression. acute pharmacological inhibition of S-acylation reduced transporter V0.5max in synaptosomes without affecting transporter expression or surface membrane expression. a dicysteine motif (C1110 and C1111) in the large intracellular linker between transmembrane domains 6 and 7 suggests the cysteine residues play similar functions. ABCA1 is S-acylated by multiple zDHHCs, although zDHHC8 shows the most robust S-acylation in overexpression assays. clipR-59 acts as a scaffold to drive phosphorylation of the Rab GTPase activating protein AS160 that is also S-acylated (206) by the protein kinase Akt to drive insulin-dependent recruitment of Glut4 to the plasma membrane. zDHHC17 prevents ClipR-59 and Akt recruitment to the plasma membrane and impairs Glut4 translocation to the plasma membrane. acylation promoted FXYD1 S-acylation in transporter function. other members of the FXYD family are also predicted to be S-acylated. the removal of PLSCR3 from the mitochondrion upon de-acylation reduces apoptosis, supporting that S-acylation of PLSCR3 contributes to the proapoptotic function of PSCLR3 in macrophages (162). a large number of such adapter proteins are S-acylated, and we are beginning to understand some of the roles of S-acylation in controlling information flow through these signaling networks. activity-dependent remodeling and expansion of the PSD involves establishment of new PSD-95 nanodomains driven by increases in plasma membrane inserted zDHHC2 (62) such remodeling is thought to be central to the mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity at synapses. a large family of cAMP-dependent PKA anchoring proteins (AKAPs) allow efficient signaling through PKA signaling pathways. the small AKAP15/18 targets PKA to the plasma membrane to promote PKA-dependent regulation of L-type calcium channels in neurons as well as endocrine and cardiac cells. two juxtamembrane cysteine residues (C26 and C29) in LAT are required for its partitioning into lipid rafts with either mutation of the cysteines or pharmacological inhibition of S-acylation disrupting raft partitioning (137). calnexin plays a role in ER calcium content and regulation of calcium signaling between the ER and mitochondria required for control of mitochondrial membrane potential (150, 151). de-acylation of calnexin at the RTC is essential for the ability of calnexin to perform its chaperone function and capture nascent polypeptides. de-acylation of calnexin prevents its association with SERCA2b with subsequent loss of the inhibitory effect of calnexin on mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake from the ER. S-acylation of steroid receptors can determine whether the receptor acts as a receptor at the plasma membrane (S-acylated receptor) or conversely controls transcription via DNA binding in the de-acylated state (130, 189\u2013191) recent evidence also points to S-acylation controlling translocation of another transcription factor, NFAT5a, from the plasma membrane to the nucleus to control gene transcription (50) 2-BP treatment of mouse embryonic carcinoma cells impaired neuronal differentiation and cell cycle exit with associated changes in H3 and histone 4 (H4), acetylation (34). this suggests that S-acylation may control histone acetylation and hence chromatin remodeling. the degree of S-acylation has been proposed to control the mode of SFK trafficking and predominant subcellular localization. non-S-acylated SFKs, such as Src, enter a rapidly recycling pathway between endosome and the plasma membrane that is controlled by myristoylation. in contrast, dually S-acylated Fyn is targeted directly to the plasma membrane. phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) is an important phospholipid required for Golgi membrane trafficking and control of phosphoinositide biosynthesis and signaling at the plasma membrane. at the Golgi, PI4P is predominantly synthesized by the lipid kinase phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase II (PI4KII) that lacks any transmembran the Rho GTPase Rac1 is also S-acylated but at a cysteine residue (C178) in the COOH terminus that is more proximal than the cysteine residues of H- and N-RAS. a brain-specific COOH-terminal splice variant replaces the COOH-terminal prenylation motif to a sequence with a di-cysteine motif (-CCAX) just upstream of the CO bCdc42 is more efficient at promoting spine remodeling in cultured neurons. bCdc42 can exist in two forms via novel form of -CAAX processing. mutants of both cysteines in the -CCAX terminus are associated with oxidative damage. in endothelial cells, eNOS is the major enzyme controlling NO production that is essential for vascular function. eNOS is dually myristoylated and S-acylated (C15 and C26) in endothelial cells, eNOS is the major enzyme controlling NO production that is essential for vascular function. phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A) is another remarkable example of how S-acylation works with other PTMs to control function. the longer PDE10A2 variant is predominantly membrane localized, including at postsynaptic membranes, that is controlled by S-acylation of C11. APP processing involves sequential proteolysis by BACE1 and -secretase to generate A peptides that accumulate in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. BACE1 is S-acylated at four cysteine residues at the junction of transmembrane and cytosolic domains. but S-acylation controlled raft localization, suggesting that BACE1 activity is similar in both raft and non-raft domains. tyrosine kinases are members of the Src family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases (SFK) implicated in a wide diversity of signaling responses including cell proliferation, changes in cell morphology and migration, as well as differentiation. tyrosine kinases may be the best studied examples of S-acylated protein kinases. non-S-acylated SFKs enter a rapidly recycling pathway between endosome and the plasma membrane that is controlled by myristoylation. if Lyn or Yes is not S-acylated, they remain in the Golgi apparatus. PI4KII assembles with zDHHC3 and 7 in lipid raft domains in the trans-Golgi network in a cholesterol-dependent mechanism (149). zDHHC3 and 7 S-acylate multiple cysteines in the 173CCPCC motif within the catalytic core of PI4KII. a brain-specific bCdc42 variant replaces the COOH-terminal prenylation motif to a sequence with a di-cysteine motif (-CCAX) just upstream of the COOH terminus. the bCdc42 variant is more efficient at promoting spine remodeling in cultured neurons based on studies using mutants of both cysteines in the -CCAX terminus. the dually prenylated and S-acylated form of bCdc42 does not interact with RhoGDI. it promotes the amount of bCdc42 at the plasma membrane and potentiating bCdc42 signaling. mutations are associated with the familial variant of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. eNOS is dually myristoylated and S-acylated (C15 and C26) in endothelial cells, eNOS is the major enzyme controlling NO production that is essential for vascular function. inhibition of eNOS S-acylation abrogates both basal and stimulated NO synthesis in endothelial cells. cyclic nucleotide PDE is highly enriched in the striatum. mouse models have implicated this PDE as a potential antipsychotic strategy. the longer PDE10A2 variant is predominantly membrane localized, including at postsynaptic membranes. e and cytosolic domains and controls BACE1 localization to \u201clipid rafts\u201d as site-directed mutagenesis of these residues localized BACE1 to non-raft domains (263). however, although S-acylation controlled raft localization, it had no effect on APP processing. a similar mechanism, to control lipid raft localization, is also observed with the effects of S-acylation of -secretase (35) zDHHC12 also increased non-amyloidogenic -cleavage of APP. neurofascin, integrin-tetraspanin complexes, and neural cell adhesion molecules are reported to be S-acylated. NCAMs are S-acylated at multiple cysteine residues that targets the NCAM to lipid rafts and subsequent downstream signaling through tyrosine focal adhesion kinase and extracellular signal regulated 1/2 kinase to stimulate neurite outgrowth. Deleted in colorectal cancer is homologous to neuronal cell adhesion molecules (NCAM) and is a receptor for the guidance molecule netrin-1. Knockdown of zDHHC21 leads to a significant reduction in PECAM1 surface expression. this is associated with a decrease in total PECAM1 expression. this suggests S-acylation controls PECAM1 stability (155) viruses, protozoans and plants lack the machinery for enzymatic S-acylation. the role of S-acylation is not fully understood in many cases. most viral proteins do not appear to undergo cycles of S-acylation. proteomic screens have identified >100 S-acylated proteins in trypanosoma brucei (53), and global inhibition of S-acylation is lethal to these organisms. a large number of S-acylated proteins have been identified in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) major goals, opportunities, and challenges are to understand mechanisms by which S-acylation is controlled, how covalent addition of lipid can control diverse properties of proteins, and how this is spatiotemporally coordinated. new proteomic, chemical biology, imaging, and genetic tools are enabling studies to understand and interrogate S-acylation at multiple levels of analysis. zDHHCs may be localized in multiple compartments including the ER, Golgi, and plasma membrane. lack of high-quality antibodies against zDHHCs remains a bottleneck. determining the cellular compartments where specific proteins are S-acylated/deacylated remains a significant challenge. a clearer understanding of loss of S-acylation regulation will be key to defining potential therapeutic opportunities to manipulate S-acylation and its associated pathways in disease. the development of new tools has the potential to provide a paradigm shift in our understanding of the physiology of S-acylation."}
