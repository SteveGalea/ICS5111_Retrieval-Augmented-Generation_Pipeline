{"summary": "the viral replicase complex (VRC) consists of virally encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and viral auxiliary replication proteins. replicase inactivity in the cytosol prevents the formation of double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) the functions of host RNA-binding proteins eEF1A, eEF1B, GAPDH, and Ded1p are to facilitate viral RNA synthesis by the tombusviral VRC. a purified toMV replicase preparation contained at least five host proteins, including an RNA-binding protein (GCD10; one of the subunits of the 10-component eIF-3 complex) pol, BMV 2apol, P2 of Alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV), toMV 180K, and Hepatitis C virus (NS5B) have to become activated after the assembly of the viral replicase in membranous spherules or vesicles (44, 45, 52, 67) the assembly mechanism of the VRC and the mechanism of RdRp activation are currently unknown. the TBSV p92 open reading frame (ORF) was PCR amplified using primers 2079 and 3529. pMalTBSV92RPR was digested with XbaI and PstI. pMalc-2X plasmid was cloned into XbaI-PstI-digested pMalc-2X plasmid. PR was digested with EcoRI and PstI and cloned into pMalc-2X. pMalTBSV92167AARPR was digested with XbaI and PstI. pMalTBSV92167AAS2 was cloned into pMalc-2X digested with PstI. alTBSV9298AA was cloned using PCR with primers 4828 (GGCATCTAGAAGTTATGCCACTAGGGTACGC) and 3529. to express CNV p92 with a deletion of the N-terminal 150 amino acids (aa), pGADHis92delta150 (40) was digested with BamHI and XhoI and then the released insert was cloned into pESC-His/Cup primers 122 and 1190, and primers 17 and 1190, with pDI72SXP (71) as the template. DI-72 ()RNA was produced from the PCR product obtained with primers 20 and 22 and pDI72SXPR3 (42), or pDI72SXPR3 (42) as the template. the PCR products were digested with EcoRI and HindIII. cloned into similarly digested pUC19, resulting in constructs pUC/181 and pUC/210. wt and mutant RII(+)-SL constructs were PCR amplified using primers 1781. to produce an artificial RNA template, mini-art-stem could support 3\u2032-terminal extension (3\u2032TEX) in the in vitro RdRp assay, first we obtained a PCR product containing an artificial sequence. resulting PCR product was digested with SphI and SacI and cloned into similarly digested construct 42. resulting PCR product contained the RII(+)-SL sequence at the 5\u2032 end. two and three non-base-paired nucleotides at the 3\u2032 end. we used primers 1300 and 4926 (TTGGACCGAAGTCCTTTCATTCATTCATTTC) and primers 1300 and 4927 (TTTGGACCGAAGTCCTTTCATTATTTCATTTC), respectively. the second type of CFE was prepared from BY4147 yeast not expressing tombusvirus proteins and RNA (50) the S1/S2 and RPR peptides were synthesized by Peptide2.0. the peptides were dissolved in RdRp buffer (final concentration, 10 mg/ml) the peptides were added at the beginning of the replication assays. the 32P-labeled RNA products were purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and precipitated. after a 70% ethanol wash and air drying, they were treated with RNase I. the TBSV p92 open reading frame (ORF) was PCR amplified using primers 2079 and 3529. pMalTBSV92RPR was digested with XbaI and PstI and cloned into a pMalc-2X plasmid. the final PCR product was PCR amplified using primers 3521 and 3529. template pMalTBSV92167AARPR was digested with EcoRI and PstI. pMalTBSV92167AARPR was cloned into pMalc-2X digested with XbaI and PstI. this resulted in the final clone, pMalTBSV92167AARPR. pMalTBSV9298AA was cloned using PCR with primers 4828 and 3529. to express CNV p92 with an N-terminal deletion of 167 aa in yeast, we used primers 4914 and 952. RI obtained using primers 415 and 1190, primers 122 and 1190, and primers 17 and 1190, with pDI72SXP (71) as the template; and R2, R3, and DI-73, obtained using primers 359 and 1190 and pDI72SXPR3 (42), or pDI72SXPR3 (42) as the template. PCR products were digested with EcoRI and HindIII. cloned into similarly digested pUC19, resulting in constructs pUC/181 and pUC/210. wt and mutant RII(+)-SL constructs were PCR amplified using primers 1781 and 1782. pUC/181/satC, pUC/210/satC and pUC/210/satC were digested. to produce an artificial RNA template, mini-art-stem could support 3\u2032-terminal extension (3\u2032TEX) in the in vitro RdRp assay. first we obtained a PCR product containing an artificial sequence. primers 1300 and 4926 (TTGGACCGAAGTCCTTTCATTCATTCATTTCATTTC) and primers 1300 and 4927 (TTTGGACCGAAGTCCTTTCATTATTTCATTTC) used yeast strain BY4147 after inducing expression of CNV p33 and p92 replication proteins from the CUP1 promoter for 40 min. the second type of CFE was prepared from BY4741 yeast not expressing tombusvirus replicase proteins and RNA yeast CFE was prepared by centrifugation for 20 min at 42,000 g at 4\u00b0C. the peptides were dissolved in RdRp buffer (final concentration, 10 mg/ml) the peptides were added at the beginning of the replication assays. the 32P-labeled RNA products were purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and precipitated. after a 70% ethanol wash and air drying, they were treated with RNase I. the tombusviral p92pol replication protein is identical to the p33 replication protein due to the readthrough expression strategy of the tombusvirus genomic RNA. the recombinant 167 and 150 mutants of CNV p92pol and the 167 mutant of TBSV p92pol were active RdRps in the absence of p33. the 621-nucleotide (nt) DI-72(+) repRNA was added to the cell extract. Lanes 11 to 14 represent in vitro assays obtained with CFE prepared from yeast cells lacking viral proteins. purified recombinant viral proteins and viral (+)repRNA were added to the assay mixture. nuclease treatment removes RNAs which are not protected by the membrane-bound replicase. micrococcal nuclease preferentially cleaves single-stranded RNAs (ssRNAs) not protected by a membrane compartment (49, 50). TBSV 167 RdRp was micrococcal nuclease sensitive. TBSV 167 RdRp was almost as active in the presence of only the soluble fraction of CFE as in whole CFE. this is in contrast with the TBSV p92pol/p33 replicase (Fig. 2A, lanes 9 and 10 versus lanes 1 and 2), which requires cellular membranes for replicase activity. however, the identities of the critical host factors in the soluble fraction of CFE are currently unknown. the TBSV 167 RdRp was able to produce some full-length viral RNAs in the presence of the p33 replication cofactor in CFE. the p33 cofactor reduced the putative 3\u2032TEX activity of TBSV 167 RdRp in the soluble fraction of CFE. construct 83-153), the very N-terminal region (construct 80), or one transmembrane region in combination with the very N-terminal region (construct 98) did not result in functional RdRps in the absence of p33 in CFE (Fig. 3B, lanes 1 to 3). deletion of one of the RNA binding sequences (167/RPR) only reduced the RdRp activity, possibly due to the presence of additional RNA binding regions in TB p33 due to the overlapping expression strategy of the TBSV genome. the C-terminal region of p92pol carries the RdRp domain and two RNA binding sequences. S1 and S2 are subdomains of the p33-p33 interaction domain. analysis of 32P-labeled RNA products shows activity of the template-dependent affinity-purified FHV replicase. the replicase assay was programmed with the TBSV DI-72 repRNA. to further test the requirement for interaction between 167 RdRp molecules to form functional RdRps, we measured the inhibitory effects of peptides on the in vitro activity of TBSV 167 RdRp. p33 replication cofactor could partially complement deletions in TBSV p92pol in CFE. deletions of either one of the p33-p33/p92 interaction subdomains (167/S1 and 167/S2) made the RdRp inactive even in the presence of p33. this suggests that interaction between p92pol and p33 molecules is likely critical for de novo-initiated RdRp activity in vitro. SV 167 RdRp protein shows high template specificity and depends on a cis-acting RNA element. the three known cis-acting RNA elements affecting the assembly and activation of the full-length T92 RdRp protein, i.e., RII(+)-SL, UL-DL, and RIV (SL1-SL2-SL3), are encircled. the critical C-C mismatch in RII( 32P-labeled RNA products obtained with various RNAs in an in vitro assay with 167 RdRp protein in yeast CFE. RII* indicates a single C-to-G point mutation within the C-C mismatch in RII(+)-SL, SL1* represents a point mutation within the -strand RNA initiation promoter (termed gPR), and SL3* shows a point mutation within the -strand RNA the TBSV 167 RdRp shows template specificity, which is, however, less complex than that observed with the TBSV p92pol/p33 replicase in vitro. we tested if TBSV 167 RdRp could bind to the RII(+)-SL cis-acting sequence required for RdRp activation. TBSV 167 RdRp binds to the RII(+)-SL cis-acting RNA sequence. mutated RII(+)-SL* element does not bind to TBSV p33 replication protein in vitro. the sizes of the de novo-generated RdRp products obtained with the same set of templates did not change after RNase I digestion. however, the sizes of the de novo-generated RdRp products obtained with the same set of templates with the TBSV p92pol/p33 replicase did not change after RNase I digestion. the original 3\u2032TEX-like RNA products can run aberrantly under these conditions due to their heat-resistant secondary structures. each experiment was repeated two or three times. oligonucleotides 1160 and 313 hybridizes to minus-strand sequences. the locations of the annealed oligonucleotides and predicted cleavage sites are indicated. only the newly synthesized portion of the 3\u2032 TEX product becomes 32P labeled. both (+)RNA and ()RNA products of de novo initiation in the CFE-based assay become 32P labeled. mini-art-stem RNA was able to activate the TBSV 167 RdRp. RII(+)-SL is the only cis-acting element required for activation. the SL3 and SL1 hairpins are not necessary for this function. the 3\u2032-end sequence of the art-stem either forms a perfect stem-loop or contains two or three non-base-paired A's. mini-art-stem RNA did not support the fully complementary 3\u2032TEX product. p33 replication cofactor did not significantly alter the production of the 3\u2032TEX RNAs obtained with the TBSV 167 RdRp. extra AA or AAA nucleotides at the 3\u2032 end produced much smaller amounts of RNA products with the TBSV 167 RdRp. DI-mini templates carrying one or two copies of a functional RII(+)-SL cis-acting element supported inefficient 3\u2032TEX by the TBSV 167 RdRp in the CFE-based assay. these RNAs contained one or two copies of the RII(+)-SL cis-acting element, with either a wt or mutated (the inactive G-to-C mutation within the C-C mismatch) sequence RII(+)-SL element with a 3\u2032-proximal wt RII(+)-SL and a 5\u2032-proximal mutated RII(+)-SL produced 3\u2032TEX products showing a similar RNase I digestion pattern to that of DI-mini. a large fraction of the TBSV 167 RdRp terminates 3\u2032TEX at the internal RII(+)-SL element in the CFE-based assay the 3\u2032TEX products obtained in the TBSV 167 RdRp assay showed a similar RNase I digestion pattern to that of DI-mini/RII+RII-C/G (lanes 14 and 16) termination favored the 5\u2032-proximal RII(+)-SL sequence. the functional RII(+)-SL element is a better RdRp termination site than the mutated RII(+)-SL element. p33 replication protein due to the readthrough expression strategy of the tombusvirus genomic RNA (73) we found that the recombinant 167 and 150 mutants of CNV p92pol and the 167 mutant of TBSV p92pol were active RdRps in the absence of p33. however, the RdRp products generated by the recombinant 167 and 150 mutants of CNV p92pol and the 167 mutant of TBSV Lanes 11 to 14 represent in vitro assays obtained with CFE prepared from yeast cells lacking viral proteins. purified recombinant viral proteins and viral (+)repRNA were added to the assay mixture. the standard de novo-initiated repRNA replication products are marked with solid arrowheads. recombinant TBSV 167 RdRp used micrococcal nuclease to test if the template RNA is protected in a membranous compartment. the RNA product of TBSV 167 RdRp was micrococcal nuclease sensitive (lanes 7 and 8), which was partially (20%) micrococcal nuclease resistant due to the presence of the replicating viral (+)RNA and ()RNA in membranous compartment TBSV 167 RdRp does not require membranes for its activity. activity of TBSV 167 RdRp was greatly enhanced by soluble factors present in the CFE (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 4), with only minimal activity in the RdRp buffer (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 2). the TBSV 167 RdRp was able to produce some full-length viral RNAs in the presence of the p33 replication cofactor in CFE. however, this activity required the cellular membrane fraction. p33 cofactor reduced the putative 3\u2032TEX activity of TBSV 167 RdRp in the soluble fraction of CFE. constructs with deletions of both transmembrane and very N-terminal sequences showed RdRp activity. we concluded that the transmembrane and very N-terminal sequences play inhibitory roles, likely preventing TBSV p92pol from being active in the cytosol of infected cells. mPTS, peroxisomal membrane targeting sequences; ub, monoubiquitinated sequence; TMD, transmembrane domains; late domain, sequence recognized by the ESCRT factors; P, phosphorylation sites; and RPR, arginine-proline-rich RNA binding domain. replicase assay was programmed with the TBSV DI-72 repRNA. we measured the inhibitory effects of peptides on the in vitro activity of TBSV 167 RdRp. the activity of the unrelated flock house virus replicase was not inhibited by these peptides. TBSV 167 RdRp uses only (+)RNA templates carrying the RII(+)-SL cis-acting element in vitro. deletions of either one of the p33-p33/p92 interaction subdomains (167/S1 and 167/S2) made the RdRp inactive even in presence of p33. 167 RdRp protein shows high template specificity and depends on a cis-acting RNA element. the three known cis-acting RNA elements affecting the assembly and activation of the full-length T92 RdRp protein, i.e., RII(+)-SL, UL-DL, and RIV (SL1-SL2-SL3), are encircled. the critical C-C mismatch in RII(+) single C-to-G point mutation within RII(+)-SL, SL1* represents a point mutation within the -strand RNA initiation promoter (termed gPR), and SL3* shows a point mutation within the RSE (replication silencer element) in the SL3 stem-loop structure. the mutations within the gPR and RSE interrupted the essential base pairing between these elements. TBSV 167 RdRp can be activated in the CFE-based assay. full-length p92pol can not be activated. TBSV 167 RdRp binds to the RII(+)-SL cis-acting sequence. wt RNA-derived RII(+)-SL and mutated RII(+)-SL* element used in binding assay. in vitro binding assay using 32P-labeled wt RII(+)-SL and mutated RII(+)-SL*. the sizes of the de novo-generated RdRp products obtained with the same set of templates with the TBSV p92pol/p33 replicase in the CFE-based assay did not change after RNase I digestion. the original 3\u2032TEX-like RNA products are marked with white arrowheads, and partially digested 3\u2032TEX-like products are shown with gray arrowheads. each experiment was repeated two or three times. Schematic representation of the 3\u2032TEX product of the DI-72 (+)RNA obtained with 167 RdRp. the solid line represents the template-dependent newly synthesized (and thus 32P-labeled) portion of the 3\u2032TEX product. avage sites indicate a lack of cleavage. only the newly synthesized portion of the 3\u2032 TEX product becomes 32P labeled. both (+)RNA and ()RNA products of de novo initiation become 32P labeled. mini-art-stem RNA was able to activate the TBSV 167 RdRp protein in vitro. RII(+)-SL is the only cis-acting element required for activation. the SL3 and SL1 hairpins are not necessary for this function. the p33 replication cofactor did not significantly alter the production of the 3\u2032TEX RNAs obtained with the TBSV 167 RdRp. we added extra AA or AAA nucleotides to the 3\u2032 end of mini-art-stem. the extra nucleotides will not be able to form base pairs, as shown in Fig. 7A. 'TEX by the TBSV 167 RdRp in the CFE-based assay. RNAs contained one or two copies of the RII(+)-SL cis-acting element, with either a wt or mutated (the inactive G-to-C mutation within the C-C mismatch) sequence. I(+)-SL, produced 3\u2032TEX products showing a similar RNase I digestion pattern to that of DI-mini with a single functional RII(+)-SL element. this pattern of RdRp products suggests that the premature termination occurred almost exclusively at the base of the functional 3\u2032-proximal (internal) wt RII(+)-SL element, not at the base of the nonfunctional 5\u2032-proximal mutated RII(+) TEX products obtained in the TBSV 167 RdRp assay showed a similar RNase I digestion pattern to that of DI-mini/RII+RII-C/G (lanes 14 and 16) termination favored the 5\u2032-proximal wt RII(+)-SL sequence. altogether, these data suggest that the functional RII(+)-SL element is a better RdRp termination site than the mutated RII(+) the viral RdRp is likely nonfunctional in the cytosol to prevent the generation of viral dsRNA molecules. the activation of the viral RdRp may take place after its membrane association and during the full assembly of the functional replicase. TBSV p92pol RdRp does not require the p33 replication cofactor or the cellular membranes to produce RNA products. the TBSV 167 RdRp did not need the 3\u2032-terminal SL1-SL2-SL3 cis-acting RNA sequences for its activation. the 3\u2032-terminal SL3 sequence has been shown to bind to cellular eEF1A, while the SL1 sequence interacts with host eEF1B (26, 28, 58) TBSV 167 RdRp requires the p33-p33/p92 interaction domain for its function. it is possible that homodimeric TBSV 167 RdRp forms a structure competent for RNA binding and RNA synthesis. the complete tombusvirus replicase contains p92pol and p33 replication proteins. the functional RII(+)-SL sequence with the critical C-C mismatch is a more efficient termination signal for the TBSV 167 RdRp than a mutated, nonfunctional RII(+)-SL sequence carrying a G-to-C mutation (instead of the internal C-C mismatch) the structure of the mutated RII(+)-SL hairpin is predicted to be more stable than that of the corresponding wt hairpin. the presence of either the N-terminal domain (predicted to face the cytosolic compartment) or the transmembrane domains of TBSV p92pol inhibits the RdRp activity in the absence of the p33 replication cofactor. the p33 replication cofactor facilitates de novo RNA synthesis and (+)RNA production. p33 replication cofactor makes tombusvirus 167 RdRp processive. truncated tombusvirus 167 RdRp almost as good as full-length p92pol. TBSV 167 RdRp shows high template selectivity and cannot utilize heterologous templates. the truncated tombusvirus RdRp is less complex than that of the full-length RdRp in cell extracts. the catalytic subunit, called RdRp, is virally encoded and is translocated to the site of replication. the TBSV 167 RdRp is likely nonfunctional in the cytosol to prevent the generation of viral dsRNA molecules. the TBSV 167 RdRp did not need the 3\u2032-terminal SL1-SL2-SL3 cis-acting RNA sequences for its activation. the 3\u2032-terminal SL3 sequence has been shown to bind to cellular eEF1A, while the SL1 sequence interacts with host eEF1B. the active TBSV 167 RdRp shows template selectivity by using RNA templates that contain the RII(+)-SL cis-acting element. the TBSV 167 RdRp, in the absence of p33 and subcellular membranes, can initiate RNA synthesis only via 3\u2032TEX. the de novo-initiated full-length ()RNA or (+)RNA products were not detected in vitro. homodimeric TBSV 167 RdRp, but not monomeric 167 RdRp, forms a structure competent for RNA binding and RNA synthesis. the complete tombusvirus replicase containing p92pol and p33 replication proteins is a processive polymerase that can synthesize long cRNA products. it is interesting that the TBSV 167 RdRp terminates RNA synthesis at the internal RII(+)-SL TBSV 167 RdRp homodimeric proteins could promote more efficient pausing for the advancing TBSV 167 RdRp on the template RNA. studies could be important for understanding subgenomic RNA synthesis, viral RNA recombination, and DI RNA formation. the replication incompatibility of the truncated p92pol protein can be partially complemented by wt p33 in yeast (40), possibly due to \u201cpiggybacking\u201d of the p92pol protein with wt p33 to the site of replicase assembly. p33 replication cofactor facilitates de novo RNA synthesis and (+)RNA production. norovirus and HCV RdRps show less template specificity. the TBSV 167 RdRp is an active polymerase and can be \u201crescued\u201d to become a fully functional RdRp."}
