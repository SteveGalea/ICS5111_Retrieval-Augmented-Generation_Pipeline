{"summary": "the introduction rubella virus (RV) is the only member of the Rubivirus genus in the family togaviridae. it acts as an extremely efficient teratogen when infection occurs during the first trimester of pregnancy. RV-induced apoptosis occurs in a complex, multi-step and rather cell type-specific manner. mitochondrial permeabilization is characterized by formation of mitochondrial apoptosis-induced channel (MAC) and the relatively large mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), which originates at the IMM. mitochondrial function is lost and the apoptotic cascade is further fueled, as metabolites, small ions and apoptogenic factors are released. cyclophilins as proteins of the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) family are highly conserved molecular chaperons that support protein folding and isomerization and thus participate in the cellular stress response. selected pharmacological compounds were applied to RV-infected cells to study the contribution of apoptosis-promoting parameters to RV-associated cellular aberrations. z-VAD-fmk at 12.5 and 25 M, PFT at 12.5 M and NIM811 at 2 M (applied at 2, 24 and 48 hpi) was the least effective compound, while the effectiveness of PFT was comparable to z-VAD-fmk. the greatest level of reduction in the floater population was reached after application of PFT (27% 2% of the SC) and z-VAD-fmk (30% 3% and 28% floaters were collected from the supernatant of the SC- and NIM811 (2 hpi)- and PFT (24 hpi)-treated and RV-infected Vero cells. the same number of floaters (1 106) was subjected to DNA extraction and analysis by agarose gel electrophoresis. z-VAD-fmk and z-VAD-fmk were both applied at 24 hpi. this time point was slightly more effective than the one at 24 hpi. pharmacological compound PFT blocks p53-mediated transcription. the number of PI- and annexin V-EGFP-positive cells was reduced after application of z-VAD-fmk. in comparison to the SC, PFT also reduces the amount of active caspase 3 and 7 but not as effective as z-VAD-fmk. mPTP opening was induced by overnight incubation of vero cells with 0.003% H2O2. time course analysis (1, 2, 3 dpi) of mPTP opening was assessed. calcein signal is shown in green, nuclear DNA in blue, cyan colour. the mitochondrial cyclophilin D (CypD) is a discussed regulatory component of the mPTP [21,22,23]. overexpression of CypD and its PPIase mutants H168Q and R97A increases the number of floaters present in the supernatant of RV-infected Vero cells. AIF antibody revealed no detectable change in mitochondrial AIF concentration in the mitochondria-enriched fraction derived at 3 dpi from RV-infected Vero cells. this indicates that only a minor portion of mitochondrial AIF translocates towards the nucleus during RV infection. as a counterstain, mitochondria were labelled with MitoTracker Red CMXRos. as a positive control, overnight incubation with 0.003% H2O2 was applied. selective permeabilization of the plasma membrane with digitonin was tested for alpha-tubulin as a representative cytoplasmic protein. as a control, immunofluorescence analysis of mock-infected Vero cells was performed after methanol (Met-OH) permeabil permeabilization with digitonin at 25 g/mL after 2% (w/v) PFA fixation gives a sufficient signal for alpha-tubulin after application of its respective antibody. however, a remarkable signal loss occurs after application of digitonin at 1 g/mL. overnight incubation with 0.003% H2O2 produces a distinct CytC signal in the cytoplasm. the expression of p53 was compared to the SC through immunofluorescence analysis with anti-p53 antibody (shown in green) and anti-C protein antibody (shown in white) as a counterstain, mitochondria were labelled with MitoTracker Red CMXRos (shown in red) before fixation. as a loading control, anti-histone 2B (H2B) and anti-VDAC antibody were applied. the results for the SC-treated vero cell population are representative for the application of NIM811 and PFT. Western blot analysis of nuclear fractions confirmed the increased nuclear localization of p53 after application of PFT. p53 was reduced after application of PFT. RV infection was visualized with anti-E1 antibody. nuclear DNA is shown in blue. after fixation with 2% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, cells were permeabilized with methanol. 0.003% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), 100 M camptothecin (CPT) and 25 g/mL cycloheximide (CHX) were found. the mRNA expression level of Cyp40 was determined to verify whether this massive shift of Cyp40 to the nucleus was also associated with an increase in Cyp40 protein synthesis. the effect of NIM811 and PFT on Cyp40 distribution was investigated. both heat shock and incubation with 0.003% hydrogen peroxide induced a shift of Cyp40 and p53 to the nucleus. the application of both camptothecin (CPT) and cycloheximide (CHX) reflects that nuclear localization of p53 and Cyp40 is not necessarily an interdependent event. pA antibody (shown in red) and anti-E1 antibody (shown in green) for RV- and mock-infected Vero cells (3 dpi) overnight incubation with 0.003% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was included. after fixation with 2% (w/v) paraformealdehyde, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% TritonX-100 (A) or with 0.3% Tween 20 (B) the course of infection of the clinical isolate RVi/Wuerzburg.DEU/47.11 (Wb-12) was compared to the cell culture-adapted strains Therien and HPV77. mRNA expression level was determined at 1, 2 and 3 dpi. despite the intensive nuclear localization of p53, the induction of p21 mRNA expression is lower than the one observed for Therien. z-VAD-fmk was applied as a positive control to assess the effectiveness of n-methyl-4-isoleucine cyclosporine (NIM811) and pifithrin (PFT) the cyclosporine A analog NIM811 is a non-immunosuppressive cyclophilin inhibitor. z-VAD-fmk (12.5 M if not otherwise indicated) and PFT (24 hpi)-treated and RV-infected Vero cells are shown in comparison to the floater population (3 dpi) of RV-infected cells. analysis of necrotic (Propidium iodide (PI)-positive) and early (annexin V-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-positive) and late-apoptotic events (annexin V-EGFP and PI-positive) by microscopic analysis of living cells. z-VAD-fmk was applied at 12.5 M such that the lowest possible effective concentration was used for its application at 24 hpi. application of z-VAD-fmk was excluded from the analysis as it is a well-characterized inhibitor of apoptosis. Figure 1C shows a clear laddering of oligonucleosomal fragments. floaters possess DNA fragmentation irrespective of the application of pharmacological compounds. calcein-acetoxymethyl (AM) is converted into the green-fluorescent dye calcein after acetoxymethyl ester hydrolysis by intracellular esterases. overnight incubation of Vero cells with 0.003% H2O2 induces massive loss of calcein from mitochondria due to pore opening. mPTP opening was assessed through application of calcein-AM. plasmids encoding native CypD protein and mutants of the PPIase domain (H168Q and R97A) floaters were determined at 3 dpi in comparison to the vector control (pcDNA3) and SC, solvent control; scale bar, 20 m. at 2 hpi, mock- and RV-infected Vero cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding AIF-TagRFP (red fluorescent protein) at 48 h post-infection and post-transfection, distribution of AIF-TagRFP was analyzed. however, in contrast to the mock infection, AIF-TagRFP can be found in the nucleus and especially in areas of condensed chromatin. mitochondria Immunofluorescence analysis of RV- and mock-infected vero cells was used as a mitochondrial counterstain. as a control, overnight incubation with 0.003% H2O2 was applied. release of CytC was induced through overnight incubation with 0.003% H2O2. overnight incubation with 0.003% H2O2 induces profound localization of CytC outside of mitochondria. in the case of RV-infected Vero cells (3 dpi), a minor but distinct portion of cells appear to have lost CytC from their mitochondria. cellular distribution of p53 Is Altered during Rubella Virus Infection was assessed in RV-infected Vero cells in the absence as well as in the presence of pharmacological inhibitors. Upon heat shock (2 h at 43 \u00b0C, followed by 24 h at 37 \u00b0C) and after overnight incubation with 0.003% H2O2, p53 nuclear localization was remarkably increased. inset depicts p53 localization outside the nucleus, close to areas of C protein localization (shown in green) and mitochondria (shown in white, stained with MitoTracker DeepRed). Upon infection with RV, only some infected Vero cells show at 3 dpi a high p53 signal within the nucleus. RV induces mitochondrial and nuclear translocation of p53. the latter decreased after application of 12.5 M PFT. 2.6. Rubella Virus Induces nuclear translocation of p53. mRNA expression level of Cyp40 at 1 (96% 31%) and 3 dpi (136% 40%) in RV-infected Vero cells was comparable to the mock-infected population (set as 100%) at 2 dpi an increase in the mRNA expression level of Cyp40 was detectable. Neither the application of NIM811 nor PFT had a noticeable influence on Cyp40 distribution in mock-infected Vero cells. under RV infection, Cyp40 distribution after application of PFT is comparable to the SC-treated population. both heat shock and incubation with hydrogen peroxide induced a shift of Cyp40 and p53 to the nucleus. after overnight incubation with 0.003% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), cells were permeabilized with 0.1% TritonX-100 (A) or with 0.3% Tween 20 (B) this is in contrast to permeabilization with Triton X-100, which shows a clear shift of CypA to the nucleus. however, as compared to the mock-infected control, only a slight shift of CypA to the nucleus can be speculated the viral titer generated during Wb-12 infection is comparable to the one observed for Therien. however, the number of floaters detected at 3 dpi per well was slightly reduced for Wb-12 ((2.25 2.29) 105 floaters per mL, n = 3) as compared to Therien (9.28 2.25) 105. under Therien infection, only a slight shift of p53 to the nucleus was detected. the induction of p21 mRNA expression level of p21Waf1/Cip1 (p21) is lower than the one observed for Therien. results point to nuclear localization of p53 as a distinguishing feature between RV cell-culture-adapted strains and clinical isolates. the release of pro-apoptotic CytC promotes the formation of the so-called apoptosome consisting of apoptotic protease-activating factor (Apaf-1), pro-caspase 9 and CytC. effector caspases can be inhibited by the pan-caspase-inhibitor z-VAD-fmk. application of NIM811 can inhibit cyclophilins such as CypD no cellular functions that are vital for RV replication were affected by the application of NIM811. it is important to note that RV specifically affects the expression pattern of the ubiquitous protein Cyp40 that acts as co-chaperone of the Hsp90/Hsp70 complex. it contributes to some unresolved issues in its physiological functions. overexpression of wild-type (WT) CypD and its PPIase mutants suggests a PPIase-independent involvement of CypD in RV-associated cell death. this notion also applies to the interaction of CypD with some of its protein partners, including hexokinase II [35] and the adenine nucleotide translocase [36]. cellular responses to a viral infection are interconnected with the resulting viral countermeasures. RV-induced apoptosis is detectable in human primary differentiated, nonproliferative cells. this strengthens the cellular context dependency of RV-associated apoptosis. the pan caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk was from PeptaNova (Sandhausen, Germany); PFT and staurosporine and camptothecin were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. stock solutions were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) stored at 20 \u00b0C and diluted in cell culture medium to their respective final concentrations directly before use. pcDNA3.1-HA-cyclophilin D/WT (pcCypD), pcDNA3.1-HA-cyclophilin D/R97A (pcR97A) and pcDNA3.1-HA-cyclophilin D/H168Q (pcH168Q) were used. floater cells were collected from 175 cm2 flasks. as a positive control, 6 106 adherent Vero cells were incubated with 5 M staurosporine for 90 min at 37 \u00b0C. subsequently, medium change cells were subjected to trypsinization. cells were incubated with 10 L RNAse A solution (500 U/mL) for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C. cell death was monitored by the binding of annexin V-EGFP. induction of apoptosis leads to binding of annexin V due to exposure of phosphatidylserine. activity of caspase 3 and 7 was determined by microscopic analysis. immunofluorescence analysis Cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde (2% w/v), permeabilized with methanol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.3% Tween 20. unspecific binding was blocked through incubation with 5% goat serum for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. a 60 mm dish (initially 1 106 cells were plated) in 500 L buffer A (10 mM HEPES, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.05% NP-40, pH 7.9) each sample was charged with 6 L 5 M NaCl and incubated under shaking conditions for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C.
