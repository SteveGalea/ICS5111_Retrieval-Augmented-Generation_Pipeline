{"summary": "Renin angiotensin system (RAS) is an endocrine system widely known for its physiological roles in electrolyte homeostasis, body fluid volume regulation and cardiovascular control in peripheral circulation. it acts on angiotensinogen (AGT), a liver-precursor, to release an inactive decapeptide, angiotensin I (Ang I) another enzyme, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) cleaves Ang I to the active ACE converts Ang I into Ang II, which binds to both the AT1R and AT2R that are expressed in neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and microglia of various sections of brain. a number of studies have reported that dysregulated brain RAS may be implicated in neurodegeneration due to neuroinflammation, oxidative stress and aging-related pathophysiological changes. the components of brain renin angiotensin system The brain RAS is an independent system involved in different brain physiological functions and disorders. different components of RAS in the brain have been identified. the establishment of brain RAS is also supported by several inhibition studies. the pro-renin in the brain binds with higher affinity to pro-renin receptors (PRRs) compared to renin, leading to AGT cleavage. however, van Thiel et al suggested intracellular renin could be the key to generation of angiotensins in the brain. evidence from clinical studies revealed ACE involvement in cognitive dysfunction since its inhibitors reduced the onset of dementia in AD. ACE2 is an enzyme expressed virtually throughout the brain and specifically in the areas controlling central BP. ACE2 acts on Ang I, releasing Ang (1\u20139). ACE2 gene therapy has been proposed as a potential antihypertensive strategy. the ACE2/Ang (1\u20137)/MASR axis is highly distributed in almost all cells of the brain. ACE2/Ang(1\u20137)/MASR axis is considered to play a protective role in the treatment of ischemic stroke. more than 90% of AGT peptides are produced in the astrocytes (Milsted et al., 1990, Grobe et al., 2008, Sherrod et al., 2005) the function of AGT is obscure in the brain. but few studies reported that hypertension and fluid balance are regulated by AGT modulation in rats and mice. infusion of Ang II in the brain increases AT1R expression. ang II regulates neurophysiology of several regions of the brain. ang II signaling via AT1R led to neurotoxicity and BBB damage. Ang III can also form angiotensin IV (Ang IV) when acted upon by AMN. ang IV acts via angiotensin receptor type-4 to mediate protective mechanisms in neurodegenerative diseases. both renin and AGT are co-expressed in many parts of the brain. ACE is the major component of RAS in the brain. it is localized in the endothelia of cerebral vasculature. its highest expression has been found in choroid plexus (CP), organum vasculosum (OVLT), subfornical organ (SFO) and area postrema (AP) ACE2 cleaves Ang II to Ang (1\u20137), a ligand for the Mas receptor (MASR) this signaling pathway has been shown to produce body functions that negate the effects of Ang II. ACE2 acts on Ang I, releasing Ang (1\u20139). ACE2/Ang(1\u20137)/MASR axis is considered to play a protective role in the treatment of ischemic stroke. a wealth of evidence has shown that the 485 amino acid long AGT molecule exists in the brain even though the precise cellular location of its origin is still unknown. angiotensin peptides and receptors Angiotensin I (Ang I), a physiologically inactive peptide has been found in the brain, although at reportedly low levels. existence of Ang II and its receptors have also been confirmed in brain. ang III can be converted to another angiotensin peptide, angiotensin III (Ang III) by an enzyme, aminopeptidase (AMN) via the removal of aspartic acid residue at the amino terminal. ang IV acts via angiotensin receptor type-4 to mediate protective mechanisms in neurodegenerative diseases. ang II activates the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediated by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX), an enzyme found in several regions of the brain. ang II induction of NOX complex stimulates superoxide generation by inflammed cells causing death of dopaminergic neurons. some studies indicate that NO might participate in some ang II-regulated processes including development of stroke in spontaneously hypertensive rats. stimulation of brain RAS by increased production of ang II caused higher levels of superoxide and malondialdehydes, and lower levels of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase. Ang II treatment of mesencephalic cultures caused activation of the microglial RhoA/ROCK pathway. upregulation of microglia tumor necrotic factor, TNF, a proinflammatory cytokine that facilitate dopaminergic neurodegeneration. a similar anti-inflammatory effect was observed in 5X familial AD mice after intranasal application of telmisartan and perindopril. ang II induced oxidative stress mediated by NOX may trigger apoptosis. telmisartan was found to attenuate lipopolysaccharide induced NO, TNF-, interleukin 1 beta (IL1-) as a possible novel neuroprotective mechanism. ang II is recognized as the major component acting via AT1R. NFs are proteins with a wide range of functions spanning across central and peripheral nervous system. centrally, they play diverse functions including resuscitation of dying neurons, synaptic plasticity, axonal development and growth of dendrites. NFs are proteins with a wide range of functions spanning across central and peripheral nervous system. the most widely studied neurotrophin 3 and BDNF cascades have been reported to be regulated by ang II. ang II induced inflammatory cascades result in cognitive dysfunction and neurodegeneration in the brain. ang IV is reported to be the natural inhibitor of the insulin-regulated aminopeptidase receptor and used as a neuroprotective agent. the two well-known ARBs, irbesartan and telmisartan, have been reported to significantly reduce the production of ROS in the retina and retinal explants. few studies reported neuroprotection by inhibition of NOX due to antioxidant effect of ARBs. thus, ARBs\u2019 treatment of several neurodegenerative brain disorders in humans might be the new therapeutic intervention to protect physiological and pharmacological insults. ang II influences neuronal N-methyl-D aspartate (NMDA) currents. superoxide produced by NOX, activates NF-kB and the RhoA/Rho kinase pathway in microglial cells. angiotensin II may also influence nitric oxide (NO) production. neuro-inflammation Both circulatory and local RAS components have been reported to play key roles in neuroinflammation-neurodegeneration pathway. ang II suggested as the main neuroinflammatory trigger (Chen et al., 2016). induction of -synuclein, a pro-microglial inflammatory molecule, also resulted in death of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra. this trend of neuroinflammation in the brain has also been demonstrated in various pharmaco-inhibition studies. the use of perindopril, a potent ACEI, in combating neuro-cognition associated pathologies is reported and supported by Perindopril Protection interleukin 1 beta (IL1-) as a possible novel neuroprotective mechanism. ang II induced oxidative stress mediated by NOX may trigger apoptosis. ang II could also facilitate apoptosis via mitochondrial ROS mediated upregulation of adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase. neurotrophic factors (NFs) are proteins with a wide range of functions spanning across central and peripheral nervous system. centrally, they play diverse functions including resuscitation of dying neurons, synaptic plasticity, axonal development and growth of dendrites. on the other hand, their distorted regulation represents a threat to the neuroprotective and cognitive roles they play thereby implicating them in a number of neurodegenerative diseases. ang II induced inflammatory cascades result in cognitive dysfunction and neurodegeneration in the brain. decreased amount of ACE2 and Ang (1\u20137) damages cells in cerebral arteries. ang IV is reported to be the natural inhibitor of the insulin-regulated aminopeptidase receptor. a number of studies demonstrated strong neuroprotection by blocking the activation of ACE/AngII/AT1R axis using ARBs and also by activation of ACE2/Ang (1-7)/MASR axis. the exact physiological and pathological roles of RAS are not evident in the brain and require more studies to elucidate their functions."}
