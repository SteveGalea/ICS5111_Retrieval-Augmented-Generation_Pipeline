{"summary": "a retrospective, observational, and multicenter study conducted in 16 tertiary PICUs in turkey includes a total of 302 children with viral cause in the nasal swab. a total of 302 children with viral cause in the nasal swab required PICU admission with no interventions. infants and preschool children have viral infection 6\u201310 times in a year, and school-age children and adolescents have 3\u20135 times in a year. 80% of 2,254 pneumonia cases in patients aged between a day and 17 years were viruses. new generation viruses including human metapneumovirus (HMPV), coronavirus, and bocavirus have also been lead to these manifestations. sis-leukopenia were recorded according to age group. treatment options were defined as respiratory support treatments. indication for PICU admission was classified as respiratory failure, cardiovascular dysfunction, neurological dysfunction, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Statistical Analysis Initially descriptive properties of variables were found. student t test was used for normally distributed numerical variables. chi-square test was used for variables with no normal distribution. duration of symptoms before admission to PICU was between one day and 116 days. hypoxia was found in 49%, tachypnea in 43%, fever in 40%, tachycardia in 34%, and hypotension in 7% of patients. acidosis was found to be a predictor for mortality (odds ratio 2.5(95%) CI, 1.2\u20134.8; p = 0.007) pH 7.10 negatively affected survival (specificity 97.9% and sensitivity 26.3%) PCO2 60 mm Hg was also shown to have negative effect on survival (specificity 78.1% and sensitivity 68.4%). % (n) p* Respiratory symptoms 79.6(113) 91.9(147) 0.002 Hypoxia 43(61) 55.3(88) 0.032 Fever 72.5(103) 53.8(86) 0.001 Tachycardia 47.2(67) 23.8(38) 0.001 Neurologic symptoms 22.5(32) 13.1(21) 0.032 Anemia 52.1(74) 39.4(63) 0.026 Leukocytosis 27. 65.5(93) 34.5(68) 0.001 *Number of patients (n); *25\u201375% and median values of hospitalization duration are given; *p is significant when it is 0.05 Anterior-posterior chest radiograph revealed positive findings in 86% of patients. no statistically significant difference was found between the patients who died and discharged. the median PRISM score was 22 (8\u201327) and median PELOD score was 11 (3\u201321) in patients with influenza. 60.2% of patients received antiviral therapy, 94.3% antibiotic therapy, 15.8% antifungal therapy. 47.4% of patients who died, and 61.6% of the patients discharged received antiviral therapy (p = 0.22). median duration of stay on MV was 4 (2\u20135) days, median duration of stay in PICU was 7 (4\u201315), and median duration of hospital was 15 (8\u201328) days in the patients who did not receive antiviral therapy. it was found that virus species did not affect mortality between patients who received and did not receive antiviral therapy. antiviral treatment on mortality according to virus species Virus species Antiviral treatment p* Without oseltamivir Patient number % Patient number % Parainfluenza 22 18,5 7 3,8 0.182 RSV 43 36,1 63 34,4 nfluenza 6 5,0 39 21,3 Rhinovirus 18 15,1 21 11,5 HMPV 4 3,4 10 5,5 Human bocavirus 5 4,2 7 3,8 Coronavirus 3 2,5 5 2,7 Aden viral respiratory tract infections constitute significant proportion of patients admitted to PICUs in winter. the most common cause of hospitalization was respiratory symptoms in our study. the most common cause of hospitalization was respiratory symptoms. patients with neurological symptoms, tachycardia, hypotension, low levels of pulse sO2, acidosis, and impaired liver or renal function at the time of admission will have a higher morbidity and mortality. in a study, it was shown that initial presentation with MODS increased mortality by 20-folds. Coronavirus was defined as the causal agent of SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which more severely progresses in adults. the disease lasts shorter and shows milder progression in children. lower respiratory tract infections caused by coronavirus types out of SARS are rare. oseltamivir can be preferred in children especially over one year of age. 60% of patients who died had an underlying disease, but a statistical correlation is lacking as described in the literature. acidosis increased mortality by 2.5-folds and MODS by 20-folds. oseltamivir initiated within first 48 hours is beneficial. oseltamivir is preferred in children with more severe symptoms."}
