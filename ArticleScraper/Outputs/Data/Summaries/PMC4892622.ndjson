{"summary": "interferons are cytokines that upregulate the expression of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes. cytokines are cytokines that upregulate the expression of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes. they represent one of the cells first lines of defense against viruses. tyrosine residue (Y20) is important for IFITM localization and their antiviral activity. PPxY motif of IFITM3 was discovered to interact with the NEDD4 E3 ligase that causes IFITM3 ubiquitination. phenylalanine residues in IFITM3 mediate interaction amongst the IFITMs. nonhuman primate IFITM proteins have been undergoing purifying selection due to viral antagonism. phylogenetic analysis shows that primate IFITM proteins have been undergoing purifying selection, suggesting that the primary amino acid sequence of IFITMs are essential for their structure and functions. anti-FLAG beads (F2426), anti-FLAG (F3165) and anti-tubulin (T8328) antibodies were purchased from Sigma. the following antibodies were obtained from proteintech (11714-1-AP) primers IFITM1 forward/reverse and IFITM3 forward/reverse. PCR products were cloned into PCR2.1 vector. 3\u20135 clones from each species were sequenced. transduced fibroblasts were selected for with 1 g/ml puromycin. unbound virus was removed 6 hours after the initiation of infection. supernatants containing newly produced virions were collected every 2 days. infectivity assay SupT1 cells were seeded at 4 X105 cells/ml in 12-well dishes. infectious virus was added in the presence of 4 g/ml polybrene with spinoculation at 1,850 X g for 1 hour at 4 C and then incubated at 37 C for 6 hours. immunoprecipitations were incubated overnight at 4 C with rotation. beads were centrifuged and washed three times with cold lysis buffer. gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. membranes were washed three times and incubated with secondary antibodies. cells were spinoculated at 1,850 X g with infectious virus for 1 hour at 4 C followed by incubation at 37 C for 4 hours. cells were then washed and refed for 18 hours at 37 C. newly generated virus was used to infect SupT1 target cells for 48 hours. 11 are unique sequences (4 IFITM1 and 7 IFITM3) at the amino acid level. a total of 18 nucleotide sequences were used for IFITM analysis. a phylogeny of IFITM was constructed using the bootstrap method. retroviral DNAs were cloned into the retroviral vector pQCXIP. pQCXIP contains an N-terminal Flag tag. the pCMV-BlaM-Vpr construct was purchased from Sigma. IFITM genes were PCR amplified from cDNAs using primers IFITM1 forward/reverse and IFITM3 forward/reverse. PCR products were cloned into PCR2.1 vector, and 3\u20135 clones from each species were sequenced. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with pHIV-8.2-Gag-Pol, lentiviral shRNA (Sigma) and VSV-G. produced virions were used to infect gorilla fibroblasts. the mixture was washed twice with cold 10% (V/V) TCA and cold ethanol. the membranes were inserted into Beta Gamma vials and read in microbeta counter. infectious virus was added in presence of 4 g/ml polybrene. at 48 hours post-transfection, HEK293T cells were harvested in RIPA buffer (containing 0.05% SDS) virions were harvested 48\u201372 h post-transfection with virus and spinoculated at 4 C for 1 hour. cells were washed and incubated in CO2-independent media with 10% FBS and 0.5 M probenecid for 16 hours at room temperature. samples were fixed in 2% formaldehyde, washed, and resuspended in PBS. 14 new nonhuman primate IFITM sequences were used for IFITM analysis. 13 are unique sequences (6 IFITM1 and 7 IFITM3) at the nucleotide level and 11 are unique sequences (4 IFITM1 and 7 IFITM3) at the amino acid level. infectivity of newly generated virus was measured using the indicator cell line HeLa-TZM-bl (TZM-bl), which is susceptible to both CXCR4 and CCR5 tropic viruses. human IFITM1 and IFITM3 had less than a two-fold reduction in infectivity. nonhuman primate IFITM1 and IFITM3 reduced HIV-1 BH10 infectivity up to 10- and 6-fold, respectively. nonhuman primate IFITMs restrict different strains of SIV HIV-1 result from zoonotic transmission of SIVcpz from chimpanzee to humans while HIV-2 arose from SIVsm of sooty mangabey. nonhuman primate IFITM proteins restrict different strains of SIV. nonhuman primate IFITMs caused an approximate 2 to 3-fold reduction in infectivity. nonhuman primate IFITM1 and IFITM3 restricted SIVagm by up to 15 to 40-fold in infectivity. nonhuman primate IFITMs inhibit the primate lentiviruses as SIVagm. IFITMs derived from Gorilla, L'Hoest's, Moustached, and Sykes exhibit stronger inhibition compared to those from Mandrill, Guereza, and Mangabey. these results suggest that HIV/SIV restriction is conserved across primate IFITMs. both human and OWM IFITM3 proteins inhibited the processing of Env precursor into gp120 and gp41. the IFITM1 protein downregulated the expression of HIV-1 Env and Gag at higher doses of transfection. nonhuman primate IFITM proteins inhibit virion-cell fusion of HIV-1 Entry of HIV-1 has previously been shown to be restricted by human IFITM proteins in target cells [15, 53] nonhuman primate IFITM proteins restrict HIV-1 entry. nonhuman primate IFITM proteins potently restrict HIV cell-to-cell spread and replication. human IFITMs showed the greatest restriction (7-fold decrease for IFITM3) of HIV-1 cell-to-cell spread when human IFITM was expressed in both the target and donor cells. nonhuman primate IFITMs share similar, perhaps modestly enhanced, cell-to-cell restriction of HIV-1 infection as those of human IFITMs. nonhuman primate IFITM proteins restrict cell-to-cell transmission. we found that the L\u2019Hoest\u2019s OWM IFITM1 had a lower peak value compared to the gorilla counterpart. a peak shift of viral replication from day 10 to day 14 for both human and gorilla IFITM3-expressing cells did not peak even after day 18. the ability of endogenous nonhuman primate IFITMs to restrict lentiviruses is ancestrally conserved. Knockdown of IFITM3 in gorilla fibroblasts decreases HIV-1 restriction. analysis of nucleotide sequences from IFITM1 and IFITM3 showed that the values of dN were much less than dS. the results suggest that the primary amino acid sequence of the IFITM proteins are crucial for their biological functions. 16899 81 2.48 0.22 -2.27 0 0 1 17727.4 98 2.48 0.22 -2.26 0 0 1 25917600 102 2.48 0.23 -2.25 0 0 1 11536.9 105 2.48 0.22 -2.26 0 0 1 3956.29 106 2.48 0.22 -2.26 0 0 1 1851.16 118 2.44 0.46 -1.98 0.02 0. nonhuman primate IFITMs differentially restrict HIV HIV has adapted various mechanisms to escape host restriction. to do so, we cloned IFITM1 and IFITM3 from 8 nonhuman primate cell lines belonging to the families Cercopithecidae and Hominidae. nonhuman primate IFITM1 and IFITM3 reduced HIV-1 BH10 infectivity up to 10- and 6-fold. nonhuman primate IFITMs did not significantly inhibit release of HIV-1 and HIV-2 from viral producer cells based on their RT activities. the infectivity of newly generated infectious viral particles was determined by infecting the indicator cell line HeLa-TZM-bl. standard errors were determined from 3\u20137 independent experiments (* indicates a p-value 0.05) nonhuman primate IFITMs restrict different strains of SIV. nonhuman primate IFITM1 and IFITM3 restricted SIVagm by up to 15 to 40-fold in infectivity. nonhuman primate IFITM proteins restrict SIVs. nonhuman primate IFITM proteins inhibit the primate lentiviruses. human and OWM IFITM3 proteins were capable of interacting with HIV-1 Env in a dose-dependent manner. both human and OWM IFITM3 proteins inhibited the processing of Env precursor into gp120 and gp41. nonhuman primate IFITM3 interacts with HIV-1 envelope. 293T cells were transfected with expression plasmids encoding HIV-1 NL4.3 without or with increasing amounts of the indicated IFITM plasmids. at 48 hours post-transfection, 293T cells were harvested in RIPA buffer. HIV-1 virions were generated by cotransfecting HEK293T cells with BlaM-Vpr and HIV-1-NL4.3. successful HIV-1 virion entry was detected by measuring cleavage of CCF2. nonhuman primate IFITM proteins restrict HIV-1 entry. human IFITMs showed the greatest restriction (7-fold decrease for IFITM3) of HIV-1 cell-to-cell spread. nonhuman primate IFITMs share similar, perhaps modestly enhanced, cell-to-cell restriction of HIV-1 infection. supernatants harvested every 2 days until cell death occurred. RT activities were measured at each time point. NL4.3 replication peaked on day 10 in both empty vector and human IFITM1-expressing SupT1 cells. we knocked down IFITM3 in gorilla fibroblasts using a lentiviral small hairpin RNA against IFITM3. expression of gorilla IFITM3 was reduced compared to that of a control shRNA. IFITM proteins are under purifying selection Analysis of nucleotide substitutions can provide insight into the type of selective pressure on proteins over time. nucleotide substitutions that result in a change in the amino acid sequence are referred to as nonsynonymous (dN) while silent changes are considered synonymous (dS) IFITM1 5 2.48 0.22 -2.26 0 0 1 2196.89 6 2.48 0.22 -2.26 0 0 1 2196.89 6 2.48 0.22 -2.26 0 0 1 2535.89 7 2.48 0.22 -2.26 0 0 1 9062.38 15 2.48 0.47 -2.01 0 0 1 1669.77 19 2.48 0.22 -2.26 0 0 1 14377.9 purifying selected sites for IFITM1 and IFITM3 are shown. no positive selected sites were detected. restriction factors are characterized with antiviral activity. nonhuman primate IFITMs have undergone purifying or negative selection. this suggests that primate IFITMs are atypical restriction factors. this suggests they have not been highly antagonized by viruses. human IFITM1 only marginally restricted HIV-1 NL4.3 (less than 2-fold) while it had a greater restriction against HIV-1 BH10 (greater than 3-fold) this could suggest certain strains of HIV-1 and HIV-2 have evolved to partially escape human IFITM restriction. the main step of IFITM mediated restriction of HIV-1 occurs in the viral producer cells and is during cell-to-cell spread. there are several differences at the amino acid level that could account for stronger restrictive properties of some nonhuman primate IFITMs. however, rare polymorphisms that present advantages to the population can occur and be preserved [70] bootstrap method using 1000 replicates was used to determine values. probability of rejecting null hypothesis dN = dS or rejecting dN = dS in favor of an alternative hypothesis is indicated."}
