{"summary": "influenza viruses evolve through antigenic drift, resulting in slightly different \u2018seasonal\u2019 influenza strains circulating each year. the adaptive immune system produces a humoral (antibody) and cell-mediated (T cell) immune response to fight the infection. initial flu watch cohort, funded by the UK Medical Research Council (MRC), began in 2006 as a collaboration between epidemiologists at the centre for infectious disease epidemiology at University College London (UCL), immunologists at the MRC Human Immunology Unit at Oxford University and the MRC General Practice Research Framework. it aims to estimate community burden of influenza and influenza-like illness, generate up-to-date knowledge of demographic, social and behavioural factors affecting influenza transmission, measure antibody and T cell immune responses to influenza. participants were selected from GP lists by computer-based random number generation. GPs sent invitation letters inviting the randomly selected person and their household to participate. compared with the English population, young adults, non-white ethnic groups, people living in socially deprived areas were under-represented in the Flu Watch cohort. to Feb 2010 Season 5 Nov 2010 to Mar 2011 Season 6 GP practices/ households/ persons.
