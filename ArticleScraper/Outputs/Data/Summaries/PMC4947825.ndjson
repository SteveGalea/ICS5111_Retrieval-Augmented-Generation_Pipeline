{"summary": "Coagulation involves three components (endothelial cells, platelets and coagulation factors) in a sequential action of primary hemostasis, secondary hemostasis and fibrinolysis. primary hemostasis is characterized by platelets that bind to injured and/or activated ECs. secondary coagulation has two separate initial pathways. Activated platelets release a number of mediators, such as ADP and vWF. the interaction between TF and factor VII initiates the intrinsic pathway. both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways result in the initiation of a common pathway, which contains cascades involved in the production of activated Factor X and thrombin. the coagulation abnormalities (coagulopathy) are characterized by a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time and thrombin time, and decreased platelet counts in the blood in patients infected with H7N923, 24, 25 or highly pathogenic H5N1.26, 27. both thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications were reported in the 2009 H1N1 influenza (\u2018swine flu') clinical trials using oseltamivir (Tamiflu) have shown that a reduction in viral load is associated with a decrease in the incidence of cardiac disorders. animals have partly explained the mechanism of activated coagulation by IAV infection. some IAV subtypes may infect lung endothelial cells. recognition of damage-associated molecular patterns, such as HMGB1 or oxidized phospholipids via TLR4, also activates ECs to drive lung injury. platelets activated by exposure to thrombin, TF, collagen and vWF. then coagulation cascades and thrombi formation are initiated. downregulation of tight junction protein on ECs leads to vascular hyperpermeability. decompensated thrombocytopenia is another reason for hemorrhage. TNF-, IL-1 and IL-6 can upregulate trypsin in ECs. hypoxia contributes to EC activation to induce release of pro-inflammatory IL-1, IL-6, platelet-activating factor (PAF), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), P-selectin and vWF. thrombosis results in passive congestion, limiting compensatory ventilation responses and then exacerbates vascular leakage and alveolar edema. pulmonary ECs subsequently play a crucial role in the initiation and amplification of the cytokine storm during an IAV infection. IL-1R signaling and MyD88/TRIF signaling are necessary for the early amplification of the cytokine storm. platelets activated by collagen, thromboxane A2, vWF, thrombin, ADP and pro-inflammatory cytokines. activated platelets release inflammatory and coagulatory mediators stored in their granules. platelets are major pro-inflammatory cells under inflammatory conditions. ytic capacity of neutrophils and formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (webs of extracellular DNA and histones)79, 80 Activated platelets also interact with T cells, B cells, NK cells, dendritic cells (DCs) and monocytes. cytokines and chemokines released from activated platelets are profoundly involved in modulation of endothelial cell function, leukocyte trafficking and immune response. administration of SCH79797 inhibits activation of platelets induced by thrombin. a deficiency in the major platelet receptor glycoprotein IIIa (GPIIIa) or treatment with anti-platelet compounds (eptifibatide, MRS 2179, clopidogrel, acetylsalicylic acid/aspirin and ticlopidine) protects mice from lethal influenza virus infection. 65 ECs and monocytes begin producing TF in response to various pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as TNF-, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 and MCP-1) and pathogen-associated molecular pattern (such as viral RNA) 60, 99 The activated coagulation cascade is initiated quickly once TF has been exposed to the blood. PAR signaling activates ECs, platelets and leukocytes to express pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. the TF/thrombin/PAR-1 pathway promotes the deleterious innate inflammatory response to an influenza virus infection in mice. activated PC exerts anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokine production and leukocyte infiltration. 109, 110, 111, 112, 113 Reduced PC increases the generation of thrombin during an influenza virus infection. ADAMTS13 is an anticoagulant protease that cleaves vWF. it is produced in liver stellate cells and endothelial cells. systemic inflammation reduces ADAMTS13 activity,128. uPA and tPA initiate the conversion of the zymogen plasminogen to the serine proteinase plasmin. plasmin plays a critical role in a variety of processes, including inflammation. plasmin binds to different receptors on monocytes, macrophages, DCs and other immune cells. plasminogen-dependent cleavage of HA is used by influenza viruses to increase replication rates and infectivity. the binding of NA of the influenza virus A/WSN/33 to plasminogen helps to sequestrate plasminogen on the cell surface. PAI-1 acts as an anti-influenza molecule through the inhibition of plasmin cleavage by plasmin. the main inhibitor of the plasminogen activators is HA, hemagglutinin, influenza A virus, NA, neuraminidase. 149, 150, 151 IAV-S. pneumoniae co-infection in mice causes a markedly more severe disease and hyper-activation of coagulation compared with IAV infection alone. the colonization of commensal bacteria or pretreatment with probiotic bacteria can dampen influenza-mediated acute lung injury. the aberrant coagulation system contributes to the severity of influenza at multiple levels. the activated ECs and platelets produce pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. coagulation factors are activated, which further augment the inflammation via PARs on ECs, platelets and leukocytes. would definitely benefit the development of more precise treatments for epidemic and pandemic influenza."}
