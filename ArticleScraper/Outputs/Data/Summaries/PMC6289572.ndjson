{"summary": "timely induction of the interferon response is pivotal for the host to mount a successful defense against invading viruses and other intracellular microbial pathogens. PRRs in turn activate the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) due to its central role in host antiviral immunity, Mavs-/- mice are highly susceptible to multiple RNA virus infections. multiple virus-encoded factors, including hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3/4A protease (Bender et al., 2015; Li et al., 2005; Ferreira et al., 2016), hepatitis A virus (HAV) 3ABC precursor (Yang et al., 2007), enterovirus (EV) 71 2Apro (Wang et al., 2013) and coronavirus S intestinal epithelial cells predominantly produce type III IFN RVs are segmented, dsRNA viruses that primarily infect the mature intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) in the host small intestine. a large number of mammalian and avian species are infected with their own host specific RV strains. HT-29 cells produced more IFN- than IFN-. human IECs expressed much more (50 fold) IFNL3 than IFNB. this type III IFN signature is specific for IECs. T and MAVS-/- HT-29 cells were stimulated with low molecular weight (LMW) poly (I:C) (200 ng/ml) or infected with the simian RV RRV strain (MOI = 1) for 24 hr. expression of IFN- and IFN- expression was measured by RT-qPCR. clonal MAVS-/- HEK293 cells were transfected with WT or indicated MAVS mutants for 48 hr and harvested for western blot or RT-qPCR analysis. for all figures except the lower panels, experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results. simian RV RRV strain was enhanced approximately 10-fold in absence of MAVS. replication of the human RV Wa strain was not significantly increased. RV infection induces degradation in a host range restricted manner. NIH3T3 cells were infected with simian RRV, human Wa or murine ETD (MOI = 5) respectively. protein levels of MAVS, VP6 and IRF3 were measured by western blot. hek293 cells were transfected with flag-tagged MAVS for 12 hr. active RV replication induces proteasomal degradation of MAVS. MA104 cells were infected with RRV (MOI = 1) and harvested at indicated time points post infection for RT-qPCR analysis. HT-29 cells were infected with Wa at MOI = 1 or 10 for indicated time points and harvested for western blot. MA104 cells were infected with RRV (MOI = 3) for 12 hpi in the presence of different chemical inhibitors. experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results. the levels of FL-MAVS (by 6 hr) and IRF1 (by 12 hr) in rhesus origin MA104 cells. the down-regulation was highly specific, as the levels of mini-MAVS, a truncated isoform that is unable to trigger IFN induction, were only affected at a high multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 and only at the latest time point examined (12 hr post infection) species-specific MAVS degradation was recapitulated using human RV infection. we found diminished luciferase production driven by IFN and ISG promoters in RRV infected MA104 cells. only proteasome inhibitors MG132, lactacystin and bortemozib, but not lysosome inhibitors chloroquine and concanamycin A, pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK, or mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, rescued MAVS expression to WT levels. RV VP3 mediates MAVS degradation. only the two reassortant RVs encoded an RRV VP3 (7-1-1 and 27-3-1) were able to degrade rhesus MAVS in NIH3T3 cells. findings strongly suggest that MAVS degradation is mediated by VP3, not NSP1. MA104 cells were infected with RRV (MOI = 3) for 8 hr in vehicle control (DMSO) or MG132 (10 M) treatment. the lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-MAVS antibody. lysates were precipitated with anti-Flag antibody. the lysates were harvested for immunoprecipitation using anti-Flag antibody. the levels of flag and IRF3 were examined by western blot. for all figures except (c), experiments were repeated at least three times. H3T3 cells were infected with reassortant RVs between simian RRV and murine ETD strains (MOI = 3) for 12 hr. levels of MAVS, VP6 and GAPDH were measured for both experiments. the lysates were harvested and examined by western blot for the levels of MAVS and GAPDH. the levels of MAVS and GAPDH were measured by western blot. for all figures, experiments were repeated at least three times. a previously uncharacterized N-terminal region (171 amino acids) of VP3 was important for its mitochondrial localization. the N-terminal domain itself, which turns out to be the most variable region with VP3 (Figure 3F), was sufficient to induce MAVS degradation. PDE catalytic sites rescued MAVS levels (Figure 3G and Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1E), suggesting that unlike RNaseL inhibition, the PDE enzymatic activity itself was not involved in MAVS degradation. we ectopically expressed VP3 from different RV strains, and not with VP3 from murine and human RV strains. chimeric simian MAVS proteins with GFP fused to distinct regions, including the N-terminal caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD), the proline-rich region (PRR) and the transmembrane (TM) region (Seth et al., 2005) degraded at almost the same efficiency as FL-MAVS. MA104 cells were transfected with indicated lysine-mutants of HA-tagged ubiquitin. levels of ubiquitin-conjugated MAVS were measured using an anti-HA antibody. HEK293 cells were transfected with indicated Flag-tagged MAVS mutants for 48 hr with or without human RV Wa infection (MOI = 3) for the last 12 hr. the levels of MAVS and GAPDH were measured by western blot. for all figures except (e) and (f), experiments were repeated at least three times. lysine 10 is more important in VP3-mediated MAVS degradation. mutation of K10 partially blocked MAVS levels in single and double mutants. lysine 10 is more important in VP3-mediated MAVS degradation. FL-MAVS and mini-MAVS expressed in mammalian cells migrate at larger band sizes than their predicted molecular weights. the same recombinant proteins from a bacterial expression system have correct sizes. mutagenesis of the SPLTSS motif to six alanines completely abolished RV-induced MAVS degradation. mutation of all three methylated arginines to alanines did not prevent MAVS degradation. disruption of this highly conserved SPLTSS motif in human MAVS also prevented MAVS phosphorylation and inhibited human RV-induced degradation. at 48 hr post infection, we harvested small intestines, isolated crude IECs. we sorted for CD26+EpCAM+CD44-CD45- mature villous IECs. despite significantly higher levels of virus replication, EW induced less IFN- expression than RRV. the amount of RRV shedding in the feces was markedly enhanced (1\u20132 logs) in Mavs-/- animals compared to WT littermates. the viral RNA level of intra-intestinal simian RRV replication, but not murine EW RV replication, was increased in Mavs-/- mice. viral NSP5, indicative of virus replication, was measured by RT-qPCR and normalized to that of GAPDH. feces samples were collected and tested for viral antigens. at least 8 mice were used in each group. 5 day old mice were infected with an equivalent dose of murine EW or simian RRV for 48 hr. IECs in the small intestine were harvested using an EDTA-DTT isolation method. simian RV replication is substantially restricted by inflammasome and IFN signaling. inflammasome-mediated pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion leads to both EW and RRV attenuation in vivo. intestinal epithelial cells predominantly produce type III IFN RVs. a single clonal MAVS knockout was confirmed by western blot and Sanger sequencing. we noted that wild-type (WT) HT-29 cells expressed and secreted significantly more IFNL3 mRNA (40\u201360 fold) than type I IFN (IFNB) infected or poly(I:C) stimulated HEK293 cells, a human non-intestinal epithelial origin cell line. both IFNB and IFNL3 expression were reduced to baseline levels in the absence of MAVS. IFNB and IFNL3 expression were reduced to baseline levels in the absence of MAVS. experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results. data are represented as mean SEM. Statistical significance is determined by Student\u2019s t test. RV infection induces MAVS degradation and blocks IFN-induction. RV infection induces MAVS degradation in a host range restricted manner. RV infection induces MAVS degradation in a host range restricted manner. lysates were harvested for western blot to examine expression level of full-length (FL) and truncated mini-MAVS, other indicated RIG-I signaling factors, RV proteins (VP4, VP6) and GAPDH. the relative levels of individual proteins were quantified (quant) with respect to the GAPDH levels. 104 cells were infected with RRV (MOI = 3) for 12 hr. they were treated with indicated proteasome and lysosome inhibitors. the lysates were harvested and MAVS level was measured by western blot. psoralen UV-inactivated RRV (UV) for 6 or 12 hpi. supernatants were harvested from mock-infected MA104 cells. lysates were harvested at 6 or 12 hpi and examined by western blot. a significant decrease in the levels of FL-MAVS (by 6 hr) and IRF1 (by 12 hr) in African Green Monkey MA104 cells following simian RRV infection (Figure 2B), we observed a significant decrease in the levels of FL-MAVS (by 6 hr) and IRF1 (by 12 hr) by all RVs (Sen et al., 2017) RV infection induced FL-MAVS degradation in an RV strain-dependent manner. only the simian RRV and, to a much lesser extent, the porcine SB1A strain, were able to induce MAVS degradation in rhesus origin MA104 cells. species-specific MAVS degradation was recapitulated using human RV infection and Flag-tagged MAVS from human, African Green monkey and rhesus monkey. we excluded the involvement of extracellular vesicles and secreted factors in MAVS degradation. only proteasome inhibitors MG132, lactacystin and bortemozib, but not lysosome inhibitors chloroquine and concanamycin A rescued MAVS expression to WT levels. transferase VP3 and viroporin NSP4 could possibly lead to the degradation of endogenous FL-MAVS in MA104 cells. the findings are further supported by the significant dose dependent reduction of ectopically expressed rhesus MAVS by simian RRV VP3 but not RRV NSP1. only the two reassortant RVs that encoded an RRV VP3 (7-1-1 and 27-3-1) were able to MA104 cells were co-transfected with flag-tagged rhesus MAVS and RRV-tagged RRV-VP3 or RRV-NSP1 plasmids for 48 hr. RRV infection (MOI = 1) for 12 hr serves as a positive control. total cell lysates were harvested and examined by western blot. lysates were harvested for immunoprecipitation using anti-GFP antibody. MA104 cells were transfected with RRV-tagged wild-type or PDE mutant RRV-VP3 for 72 hr. they were then subjected to sorting for GFP positive cells. RV VP4 is cleaved into N-terminal VP8* and C-terminal VP5*. NIH3T3 cells were infected with reassortant RVs between simian RRV and bovine UK strains for 12 hr. MA104 cells were infected with RRV (MOI = 3) for 12 hpi in the presence of phosphodiesterase inhibitors. lysates were harvested and examined by western blot for the levels of MAVS and GAPDH. a previously uncharacterized N-terminal region (171 amino acids) of VP3 was important for its mitochondrial localization. a previously uncharacterized N-terminal region (171 amino acids) of VP3 was important for its mitochondrial localization. co-IP experiments also pinpointed the N-terminal domain to be the MAVS-interacting part of VP3. we found that the C-terminal PDE domain, recently shown to prevent RNaseL activation, was not required for MAVS degradation. we ectopically expressed VP3 derived from different RV strains. a series of chimeric simian MAVS proteins with GFP fused to distinct regions, including the N-terminal caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD), the proline-rich region (PRR) and the transmembrane (TM) region remained stable during RV infection. lysates were harvested and examined by western blot. MA104 cells were transfected with indicated lysine-mutants of HA-tagged ubiquitin for 48 hr, infected with RRV (MOI = 1) for the last 12 hr. lysates were harvested for immunoprecipitation using an anti-HA antibody. percentage of phosphorylation and methylation modification in total MAVS proteins is presented as %. HEK293 cells were transfected with indicated Flag-tagged MAVS mutants for 48 hr with or without human RV Wa infection (MOI = 1) for the last 12 hr. the levels of MAVS and GAPDH were measured by western blot. lysine 10 is more important in VP3-mediated MAVS degradation. lysine 10 is more important in VP3-mediated MAVS degradation. a panel of ubiquitin mutants found that MAVS was modified by K48 poly-ubiquitination (Figure 4E) during RRV infection, MAVS was modified by K48 poly-ubiquitination (Figure 4E), consistent with its degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (Figure 2F). both FL-MAVS and mini-MAVS expressed in mammalian cells migrate at larger band sizes than their predicted molecular weights. TBK1, a key kinase downstream of MAVS signaling for IFN activation, was not responsible for MAVS phosphorylation at this novel site. mutagenesis of the SPLTSS motif to six alanines abolished RV-induced MAVS degradation. however, mutation of all three methylated arginines to alanines did not prevent MAVS degradation. we first orally infected 5-day-old wild-type B6129SF2/J pups with the homologous EW strain of murine RV (104 diarrhea dose 50) or a heterologous simian RV RRV strain (107 plaque forming units, PFUs) at 48 hr post infection, we harvested small intestines, isolated crude IECs, and sorted for CD26+EpCAM+CD44-CD45- mature villous IECs a diminished IFN- response to EW infection is consistent with MAVS inhibition and disruption of the IFN induction pathway. we compared fecal RV antigen shedding induced by EW and RRV infection in WT and Mavs-/- pups over a 12 day course. the replication of RRV was significantly lower than EW, consistent with previous publications. FN- expression in heterologous RV is enhanced in selected knockout mouse strains. small intestines, liver and mesenteric lymph node (MLN) were harvested at 3 dpi or 7 dpi from EW or RRV-infected animals. levels of viral NSP5, indicative of virus replication, was measured by RT-qPCR and normalized to that of GAPDH. 5 day old B6129SF2/J pups were infected with an equivalent dose of murine EW or simian RRV for 48 hr. small intestinal IECs were harvested using an EDTA-DTT isolation method. RNA levels of mavs were measured by RT-qPCR analysis. simian RRV replication in the small intestine was substantially up-regulated (approximately 100-fold) in Ifnar1-/-, Mavs-/-, Casp1-/- and Nlrp9b-/- mice but not in Il18-/- animals. the suppressive effect on RV fecal shedding was much more profound for simian RV than that for the homologous murine RV. innate immunity has served as a prototypic molecule in the study of virus-host co-evolution. we uncovered a unique mechanism employed by homologous RVs to target MAVS in their homologous host for degradation and inhibit the RNA sensing pathway in infected IECs. FN- and IFN- expression is in contrast to the previously reported role of pex-MAVS capable of specifically activating IFN- in response to Listeria. it is likely that the extent of IFN- induction via pex-MAVS occurs in a pathogen (or context)-specific manner. RV RNA capping enzyme VP3 localizes to mitochondria using a previously uncharacterized N-terminal domain. it induces MAVS phosphorylation at the SPLTSS motif (Figure 4F) and subsequent ubiquitination at the K10 residue within the CARD domain. this series of events mediates MAVS proteasomal degradation. we performed IP-MS and compiled a list of host E3 ligases that interact with MAVS during RV infection. however, knocking down any of them did not rescue MAVS from degradation. degradation of MAVS at least partially contributes to the successful suppression of host innate immunity and RV host range restriction. this work reveals a new phosphorylation motif (SPLTSS) within MAVS that is subject to RV VP3 mediated regulation. inflammasome mediated antiviral signaling is comparable to IFN signaling in its ability to suppress heterologous RV replication. lines were tested negative for mycoplasma contamination. EGFP-tagged simian MAVS chimeric plasmids were PCR-amplified from pMP34-3. flag-tagged MAVS and His-tagged VP3 were cloned into CET1019-AS vector (UC0E02, Millipore) for recombinant protein expression in CHO-S cell system. recombinant protein expression was a kind gift from Dr. Jack Rose (Yale University) IEC isolation by EDTA-DTT extraction method and flow cytometry of mature villous IECs were performed as previously described. expression of recombinant MAVS and VP3 proteins Flag-tagged rhesus MAVS and His-tagged RRV VP3 were cloned into CET 1019 AS-Puro mammalian expression vector (Millipore) mass spectrometry HT-29 cells or MA104 cells were infected with human RV Wa strain or simian RV RRV strain respectively. lysates were further resolved in SDS-PAGE gel and cut into eight pieces for peptide retrieval.
