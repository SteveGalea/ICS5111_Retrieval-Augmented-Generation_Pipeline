{"summary": "over 600 genes have been implicated in schizophrenia in association studies. epistasis between genes within these same signalling networks markedly affects the degree of risk-promotion [8\u201310], in part, explaining the inconsistency in genetic association studies. a number of autoantigens/autoantibodies to key schizophrenia-related proteins have also been reported. the size of the tags is proportional the number of pathogen's proteins that are homologous to the autoantigens. the original BLAST files can be found at http://www.polygenicpathways.co.uk/blasts.htm. genes, risk factors, and immunity can be linked together. Dysfunction of this network which is conditional upon interactions between its three branches may be responsible for schizophrenia. antigenicity (B-cell epitope prediction) was estimated using the bepiPred server http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/BepiPred/ [32].

NDUFV2 is a subunit of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and its protein expression levels are reduced in the frontal cortex and striatum in schizophrenia [50]. MAP6 is a microtubule protein that controls synaptic organisation. KCNH2 is a potassium channel that plays a role in the development of neural crest cells [57] and in lymphocyte proliferation [58]. DISC1 DISC1 DISC1 is a key \u201chub gene\u201d in schizophrenia linked, via its interactome, to many other schizophrenia susceptibility gene products. it is homologous to DISC1 in several regions, over its entire length, many matches in regions of high immunogenicity. several viruses, including herpes simplex, hepatitis C, Epstein-Barr, the cytomegalovirus, adenovirus and Coxsackie virus, are known to bind to DISC1 interaction partners. proteins in red are homologous to Rubella proteins. viral DNA is thus both inter and intragenic (Figure 1). it has been proposed that retroviral integration, into paternal and maternal gene lines, inserting several genes at once and effectively creating a new being, is responsible for evolutionary saccades. the same virus provokes repeating patterns in the human proteome. KEGG Pathway Analysis of Schizophrenia Susceptibility Genes. it confirmed the involvement of a number of polygenic pathways. a large number of immune-related pathways are traced out by these genes, together with many pathogen-related pathways, including toxoplasmosis. pathogen pathways Viral pathways Immune Toxoplasmosis 16 Focal adhesion 20 Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction 26 Chagas disease 15 Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) 19 Jak-STAT signaling pathway 16 Amoebiasis 13 Regulation of actin cytoskeleton 17 Systemic lupus erythematosus 13 Leishmaniasis 12 Protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum 13 T cell receptor signaling pathway 13 Viral -beta signaling pathway 3 Lysosome 2 Regulation of autophagy 2 Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis 1 Primary immunodeficiency 1 There is no specific viral life cycle pathway within the KEGG dataset. viruses use adhesion molecules as receptors, endocytosis for cellular entry and the intracellular actin and tubulin networks for migration to and from the nucleus. they subjugate intracellular vesicular trafficking the virus expresses proteins homologous to monoamine and other amine oxidases as well as to a number of dopamine and monoamine transporters. this is illustrated by the norovirus (Norwalk) which causes vomiting sickness. the homologous human proteins of the viral risk factors implicated in schizophrenia correspond to the genomic locations of 632 schizophrenia susceptibility genes. a viable interpretation is that these genes encode for proteins with homology to the viral risk factors. other pathogens, including Borrelia Burgdorferri and T. Gondii, have also been implicated in schizophrenia. DISC1, neuregulin, ERBB4, FEZ1 or COMT knockout mice display many of the pathological and behavioural symptoms associated with schizophrenia. virus knockdown or interference of foetal proteins by viral-induced antibodies targeting their human counterparts may contribute to the neurodevelopmental disturbances observed in schizophrenia. studies have reported changes in the cytokine profile in the brain, CSF or peripheral immune compartments. these data suggest that susceptibility gene products are the vehicles enabling the risk-promoting effects of pathogenic risk factors. pathogen detection and elimination or vaccination, particularly prior to pregnancy, might be expected to reduce the incidence of schizophrenia. peptide matches to many human proteins [149]. this is corroborated by data posted at http://www.polygenicpathways.co.uk/blasts.htm. DISC1 DISC1 is a key \u201chub gene\u201d in schizophrenia linked, via its interactome, to many other schizophrenia susceptibility gene products. DISC1 is a highly immunogenic protein, as predicted by B-cell epitope prediction. the viral risk factors implicated in schizophrenia express proteins that are homologous to the highly antigenic regions of the DISC1 protein. the DISC1 interactome see http://www.polygenicpathways.co.uk/discforum.htm. proteins in red are homologous to Rubella proteins. the insertion of viral DNA into the human genome had until recently been thought to be the preserve of retroviruses. the same is true of the Herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) which is homologous to multiple lipoprotein receptors. the same is true of the cytomegalovirus which expresses proteins homologous to many chemokine receptors. repeated viral visits to the human genome over millions of years are responsible for the creation of gene families. KEGG Pathway Analysis of Schizophrenia Susceptibility Genes. it confirmed the involvement of a number of polygenic pathways. a large number of immune-related pathways are traced out by these genes, together with many pathogen-related pathways. endocytosis 12 Phagosome 12 Staphylococcus aureus infection 7 Phagosome 12 Allograft rejection 11 Epithelial cell signaling in Helicobacter pylori infection 6 Gap junction 11 Hematopoietic cell lineage 11 Malaria 6 Tight junction 11 Antigen processing and presentation 10 Tryptophan metabolism 6 Adherens junction 6 Fc epsilon RI signaling pathway 10 NOD-like receptor signaling pathway lysosomal and phagosomal pathways subjugate intracellular vesicular trafficking pathways. their exit may depend upon exocytosis, or by apoptotic or other means of killing their host cell [122]. these pathways are heavily represented within the schizophrenia gene analysis. the homologous human proteins of the viral risk factors implicated in schizophrenia correspond to the genomic locations of 632 schizophrenia susceptibility genes. this may be due to the presence or absence of active infection with these and other pathogens. a viable interpretation is that these genes are susceptibility genes precisely because they encode for proteins with homology to the viral risk factors. pathogens may promote disease if the human genes encode for homologous products, and the genes promote disease if the homologous pathogen is encountered. autoantibodies to several proteins have been reported in schizophrenia. all are homologous to proteins expressed by the risk factors in schizophrenia. effects of antibody knockdown have not been analysed for any schizophrenia related proteins. susceptibility gene products are the vehicles enabling the risk-promoting effects of pathogenic risk factors, via the interactions described above. vitamin D is able to stunt the growth of T. Gondii [147] and low levels of this vitamin have been associated with schizophrenia risk, although abnormally high levels are also a risk factor. this scenario suggests a novel and probably common class of autoimmune disease caused by pathogens but dependent on our genes. multiple sclerosis autoantigens are homologous to the products of the Epstein-Barr virus which has been implicated in this disorder. our genomes and polymorphisms determine which vatches we possess, which pathogens match these sequences and which pathogen-related disorder we might develop. the power of current day bioinformatics should be possible to rapidly identify all vatches in the human proteome and to pair them with the various pathogenic species and human diseases."}
