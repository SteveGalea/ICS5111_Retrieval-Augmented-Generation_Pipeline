{"summary": "1.6 million people died of tuberculosis in 2017, higher than their share of estimated cases. 1.7 billion people, 23% of the world's population, are estimated to have a latent TB infection. influenza viruses cause mild to moderate respiratory illness in most people, but some develop fatal infections. virulence factors encoded by viral genes can explain seasonal or geographical differences at a population level. TB outcome depends on host intrinsic (genetics) and extrinsic factors, as well as on host factors that are still unclear. -like receptors (TLR), nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing (NOD) receptor, NOD-like receptors (NLR), RIG-I-Like Receptors (RLR), and receptor CD14. most of the signaling pathways converge on signaling hubs, such as transcription nuclear factor (NF-), interferon regulatory factor families (IRF3, IRF7), and mitogen-activated protein kinase. adaptive immune response requires activation of antigen-specific T and B lymphocytes. protective immunity against M. tuberculosis depends on CD4+ T-helper1 lymphocytes that secrete interferon-gamma (IFN-), IL-2, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-), which leads to macrophage activation, cytokine production, and bacterial control. congenital defects of the airways, familial congenital bronchiectasis or tracheobronchomegaly can also play a role. cystic fibrosis is the most common autosomal recessive disorder and primary cause of bronchiectasis in the developed world. ency disorders (PIDs), most of them monogenic conditions with Mendelian inheritance, are associated with crucial defects in adaptive immunity (31) innate immune responses are redundant, with pleiotropic nature of some gene products. phenotype of particular inborn errors of immunity is very narrow, with susceptibility to only one specific infection (36, 41, 42) IgG hypogammaglobulinaemia, neutropenia, hepatitis B reactivation and varicella zoster Yes Yes Age appropriate Yes Lymphoid cells surface antigens (CD22, CD30, CD33, CD38, CD40, SLAMF-7, CCR4) Similar to anti CD20 Optional Yes Age appropriate Yes Immune checkpoint inhibitors, cell adhesion inhibitors, sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulators the genetic contribution for the propensity to develop severe RSV infection was estimated to account for 20% of the variance in RSV disease severity. genetic variations in dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3 grabbing non-integrin have been linked with reduced risk of developing TB (48). mycobacterial disease is a syndrome characterized by susceptibility to weakly virulent mycobacteria, including the attenuated vaccine Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) strain. different gene mutations have been identified, most of which are related to IFN-mediated immunity (49\u201351) treatment with BRM results in an increased risk for pneumonia, influenza-related complications, TB and NTM, Pneumocystis, and fungal infections, such as histoplasmosis. the knowledge obtained from experience with the prescription of BRM may be particularly valuable for the understanding of some genetic inborn errors. in Figure 1 we present the sites of action and associated risks of the most frequently prescribed BRM. risk of developing infections according to the BRM considered is also shown. two recent meta-analyses have calculated the relative risk of infection. national registries have confirmed the increase on the impact of any infections (20%), serious infections (40%), and TB (250%), associated with anti-TNF- use (60). the risk of serious infections is highest during the first 6 months of therapy (62) (up to 4.5-fold risk) anti-TNF- therapy (infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, certolizumab pegol, and etanercept) is associated with a 2- to 4-fold increase in the risk of active tuberculosis and other granulomatous conditions. this rate is 10- to 20-fold higher than the observed rate in nave patients. patients with RA and underlying structural lung diseases are at increased risk of developing NTM infection (78), mostly Mycobacterium avium. a baseline chest x-ray should be recommended prior to starting therapy. a baseline chest x-ray should be recommended prior to starting therapy. the absence of a measurable immunological defect does not exclude an immunodeficiency (41). further functional genetic studies are necessary in order to fully validate the impact of host genetics during lung infections. recommendations based on biological rationale and clinical experience are mandatory in order to prevent re-emerging severe infections."}
