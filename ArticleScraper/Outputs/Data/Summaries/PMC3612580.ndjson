{"summary": "METHODS Between April 2009 and January 2010, FLU-CIN collected clinical, epidemiological and outcome data on patients admitted to 75 hospitals in 31 UK cities or towns with confirmed H1N1pdm infection. a large dataset was collected by specifically trained data collectors, and included demography, pre-existing medical conditions, acute and long-term medications. a nested case\u2013control analysis of the surveillance cohort was used to investigate the association between a diagnosis of asthma and severe outcome from H1N1pdm 2009 infection. the latter being defined as death or the need for level 2 or level 3 (intensive care unit) care while in hospital. all covariates were independently associated with both exposure (asthma) and outcome. results are presented as adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. p-value of 0.05 was taken to be statistically significant. a covariate that modified the original unadjusted odds ratio by at least 10% towards a null association was then included in the final multivariable logistic regression model. a p-value of 0.05 was taken to be statistically significant. asthmatics reported significantly more dyspnoea at the time of admission (58.4% versus 30.8%; unadjusted OR 3.15, 95% CI 2.48\u20134.0) and were significantly more likely to receive supplemental oxygen. differences were similar when children and adults were analysed separately. 0 298 (77.4) 838 (73.8) 1.00 1 56 (14.6) 211 (18.6) 0.75 (0.54\u20131.03) 0.076 2 31 (8.0) 86 (7.6) 1.01 (0.66\u20131.56) 0.951 Charlson index score 0 296 (79.9) 843 (74.3) 1.00 1\u20132 79 (20.5) 236 (20.8) 0.95 (0.72\u20131.27) 0.744 3\u20135 10 (2.6) 53 (4.7) 0. oxygen saturation 92% 173 (44.9) 378 (33.3) 1.63 (1.29\u20132.07) 0.001 D: respiratory exhaustion 12 (3.1) 12 (1.1) 3.01 (1.34\u20136.76) 0.008 E: severe clinical dehydration or clinical shock 59 (15.3) 123 (10.8) 1.49 (1.07\u20132.08) 0.020 F: altered consciousness 17 (4.4) 88 (7.6) 0.55 (0.32\u20130.94) 0.028 G: other clinical concern 38 (9. asthmatics Unadjusted OR (95% CI) p-value Total patients 385 (25.3) 1135 (74.7) Treatments Pre-admission antibiotics 78 (20.3) 202 (17.8) 1.17 (0.87\u20131.57) 0.282 Pre-admission antivirals 44 (11.4) 128 (11.3) 1.02 (0.71\u20131.46) 0.936 Pre-admission inhaled corticosteroids 203 (52.7) 51 (4.5) 23.70 pneumonia compared with nonasthmatics (asthma 17.1% versus 16.6%;
