{"summary": "innate and adaptive mucosal immune responses at mucosal surfaces are of major importance to modulate colonization of commensal and pathogenic microorganisms. vaccines that generate protective antibody (and cell-mediated responses) at mucosal sites would greatly advance the field of vaccinology. intranasal (i.n.) route of immunization requires lesser amounts of antigens than oral administration. safety and efficacy of i.n. vaccines remain to be established. there has been renewed interest in investigating potential of systemic immunization for eliciting mucosal immunity. administration of vaccines has long been used and studied as an experimental immunization route for the induction of systemic immunity in animal models of vaccination. however, the i.p. route, in certain antigen-adjuvant combinations, has also been reported to induce mucosal immune responses. i.p. immunization of mice with mycobacterium PstS-1 antigen failed to induce specific IgG and IgA responses in bronchoalveolar lavage or saliva. i.p. immunization of mice with a cholera toxin (CT-adjuvanted Mycoplasma pulmonisvaccine) elicited significant specific IgG and IgA responses in sera and peritoneal fluids, and ted SARS-CoV VLPs increased antigen-specific IFN- and IL-4 producing cell populations in the spleen, and IgA antibodies in lungs, intestine, feces, and vaginal washes. i.p. immunization of mice with rotavirus 2/6 VLPs was shown to be more effective than oral immunization in the induction of mucosal IgG and IgA in the fe i.m. immunization of a bovine rotavirus VP6 DNA vaccine effectively protected mice against oral challenges with a murine rotavirus strain. i.m. immunization of a bovine rotavirus VP6 DNA vaccine effectively protected mice against oral challenges with a murine rotavirus strain. immunization of >10-wk-old infants with 2 full or 1/5 doses of inactivated poliovirus vaccine resulted in >80% seroconversion. i.m. immunization of mice with a DNA vaccine co-delivered with CCL25 chemokine enhanced antigen-specific IFN- secretion by CD3+CD8+ and CD3+CD4+ T cells in mesenteric lymph nodes. i.m a fourth i.m. immunization administered 90 weeks after the third one boosted antigen-specific humoral and cellular responses. some vaccines administered by i.m. route were less effective or inefficient in inducing mucosal immune responses. s.c. immunization of 3- to 8-week-old calves with a BRSV immunostimulating complex (BRSV-ISCOM) vaccine induced potent lymphocyte proliferation responses concomitant with high levels of IFN- and IL-4 production in PBMCs. s.c. immunization with retinoic acid plus CT or inactivated Salmonella typhimurium elicited robust antigen-specific anti-CT and anti- i.m. immunization of mice with the B subunits of Shiga toxin type 1 and 2as a fusion protein failed to induce any fecal antibody responses. vaccination effectively reduced fecal bacterial shedding after oral challenge with E. coli O157:H7. pigs i.d. immunized with a sperm-DNA vaccine showed significant reduction of gross pathological lesions and bacterial shedding in urogenital tract. i.d. vaccination of mice with inactivated influenza virus induced more robust serum and lung IgG responses, increased expression of IL-4 and IFN- in spleen and IL-12 in lung. vaccinated mice were protected against lethal pulmonary challenges. little mucosal immune responses were detected. some vaccines failed to induce sufficient mucosal antibodies or to protect against mucosal challenge. an adjuvant-free, powdered, inactivated influenza vaccine placed on the shaved abdominal skin of mice elicited specific IgG and IgA responses in serum and at several mucosal sites. it effectively increased the survival rate of mice against an i.n. challenge with the influenza virus. cytokine (IL-2, IFN- or TNF-) producing all 3 cytokines was highest in TCI group, and lowest in i.d. immunized group. significantly increased antigen-specific CD8+ T cells were found in blood after i.d. and TCI immunization while absent after s.c. immunization. ecal IgA responses were detected in vaccinees compared to the placebo controls. however, the vaccination only mitigated, but did not prevent, the infection after an oral challenge with a virulent ETEC strain. several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the induction of mucosal antibodies after systemic immunization. s increase local recruitment, antigen processing and presentation efficiency of the APCs at the site of vaccination, promote proliferation of antigen-specific T cells and antibody-secreting B cells. these cells then migrate to the distant effector sites, such as lamina propria (LP) of the gut and salivary glands96,95,97. i.p. immunization generally induces non-protective mucosal (particularly the gastrointestinal) IgA responses while i.m. immunization with DNA-based vaccines is likely to induce a protective mucosal immune response including CMI. i.m. immunization with DNA-based vaccines is likely to induce a protective mucosal immune response. +(17) +(18,26,28) +(27,28) +(18,23) i.m. +(33) ++(35) ++(47) +(37) ++(32,47) (55) ++(34,35) +++(38)
