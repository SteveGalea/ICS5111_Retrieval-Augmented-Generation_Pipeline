{"summary": "each RNA segment of IAV is encapsulated by multiple copies of the viral nucleoprotein (NP) the viral nucleoprotein (NP) acts as a key structural determinant of a viral ribonucleoprotein complex (vRNP) (3\u20136) vRNP is critical for catalyzing viral RNA transcription (vRNA-mRNA) and replication (vRNA-cRNA-vRNA) in the nucleus of infected cells. mTORC1 (mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1) kinase is a key negative regulator of the ULK1 complex (Unc-51-like autophagy activating kinase 1) kinase is a key negative regulator of the ULK1 complex (Unc-51-like autophagy activating kinase 1). the PI3K complex (BECN1/Beclin1-ATG14-VPS15- lipidation of LC3-I generates LC3-II. a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged LC3 can be used as a specific marker of autophagosomes. autophagy inhibits pathogenic infection by wrapping viruses in the autophagosome. autophagy promotes viral replication through regulation of the HSP90AA1\u2013AKT-mTOR pathway (60). previous studies have demonstrated that IAV infection induces autophagy depending on the AKT-TSC2-mTOR signaling pathway (61), and several viral proteins such as hemagglutinin (HA) and NS1 are involved in initiating the formation of autophagosomes. osome accumulation at as early as 9 h postinfection (hpi) once the viral NP protein could be detected in virus-infected A549 cells. the autophagosome accumulation increased gradually to 36 hpi with the NP protein accumulation. the results suggest that protein accumulation during IAV replication is essential for autophagy induction. negative-control (NC) cells knocked down by a nontargeting small interfering RNA (siRNA) similar results were also obtained in cells with knockdown of the common ubiquitin E1-like activating enzyme ATG7. expression levels of LC3-II as well as those of influenza viral proteins PB1, PB2, PA, NP, and M2 were reduced in LY294002-, ATG5-, and BECN1-treated HM/06-infected cells. lysates were harvested and analyzed by Western blotting. levels of NP gene vRNA, cRNA, and mRNA were measured by quantitative RT-PCR. values were standardized to the levels of control-treated or siNC-infected cells at 12 hpi (*, P 0.05; **, P 0.01; **, P 0.01; **, P 0.001) induction of autophagy with starvation increases influenza virus replication. culture supernatants were collected, and virus titers were determined by TCID50 assay. the results suggest that autophagy has no effect on viral entry, binding, and internalization. culture medium of A549 cells was exchanged with Ham\u2019s F-12 medium without FBS for 6 h or pretreated with rapamycin for 12 h and then incubated with the HM/06 virus at an MOI of 10 for 30 min. cells were washed with PBS-HCl (pH 1.3) to remove all attached virions from the surface of A549 cells. quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) at 4 hpi. results suggest that the enhancing effect of autophagy induction on viral replication occurs during the early stages of the viral life cycle or during viral RNA synthesis and protein expression. inhibition of autophagy impairs the early stages of the viral life cycle or viral RNA synthesis. autophagy suppressed luciferase reporter enzymatic activity (1.51-fold), suggesting that autophagy increases the viral polymerase activity. at 4 hpi, as expected for an intermediate time point in the virus life cycle, NP was observed to be located in both siNC- and siATG5-treated cells. siATG5- or LY294002-pretreated A549 cells were mock infected for 4 hpi. mRNA and vRNA levels were determined by RT-PCR. HEK 293T cells were transfected with siATG5. y promotes influenza viral gene expression and RNA synthesis. NP is associated with viral RNA and RdRp and acts as a key structural determinant of vRNP (5, 6), and M2 is able to induce autophagosome accumulation (62) so, the localization of influenza viral M2 and NP proteins with GFP-LC3 puncta was analyzed by immunofluorescence analysis. NP and M2 proteins induce autophagy and interact with LC3. NP also coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous LC3 in HM/06-infected cells. this leads to an increase in influenza virus replication. the image is representative of 20 cells. Scale bar, 10 m. (C) HEK 293T cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids for 24 h. cells lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody. levels of total AKT, FKHR, and p70S6K were time-dependently decreased from 12 to 36 hpi. levels of phosphorylated AKT, FKHR, and p70S6K increased from 6 to 36 hpi. the levels of phosphorylated AKT, FKHR, and p70S6K increased from 6 to 36 hpi. NP- and M2-induced autophagy is dependent on the AKT-mTOR pathway. autophagy promotes IAV RNA synthesis by regulating HSP90AA1 expression. the efficient transcription/replication of the viral genome is dependent on host factors. NP-induced LC3-II increase was significantly depressed in HSP90AA1-knockdown cells compared to that of the NC-knockdown cells. results showed that the NP-induced LC3-II increase was significantly depressed in HSP90AA1-knockdown cells. NP and M2 mediate autophagy induction by modulating HSP90AA1 expression, resulting in an increase of the binding of HSP90AA1 to PB2. inhibition of autophagy decreases influenza virus replication. results suggest protein accumulation during IAV replication is essential for autophagy induction. the autophagy gene ATG5 is required for activating autophagy. it is involved in one of the two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems. the viral progeny titers were also dramatically decreased in the ATG5-knockdown cells compared with the levels at 12, 24, and 36 hpi in negative-control cells knocked down by a nontargeting small interfering RNA. titers were determined by TCID50 assay on MDCK cells. expression levels of LC3-II as well as those of influenza viral proteins PB1, PB2, PA, NP, and M2 were reduced in LY294002-, ATG5-, and BECN1-treated HM/06-infected cells. 2, siATG5, or siBECN1 were mock infected or infected with the HM/06 virus. cell lysates were collected at 12, 24, and 36 hpi. total RNA was extracted, and levels of NP gene vRNA, cRNA, and mRNA were measured by quantitative RT-PCR. the culture medium of A549 cells was exchanged with Ham\u2019s F-12 medium without FBS for 6 h or pretreated with a control (DMSO) or 500 nM rapamycin for 12 h and then were mock infected or infected with HM/06 at an MOI of 0.1. at 24 hpi, cell lysates were collected and subjected to the Western blot analysis. the virus titers were comparable in the starvation-, rapamycin-, and control-treated cells. these results suggest that autophagy has no effect on viral entry, binding, and internalization. NP expression was examined by Western blotting at 4 hpi. results showed that the expression level of NP experienced a significant increase in both the starvation- and rapamycin-treated cells infected with the HM/06 virus in comparison with the level in control-treated HM/06-infected cells. significant reductions in the M gene vRNA and mRNA levels were detected in a549 cells treated with an siRNA targeting ATG5 (siATG5) and LY294002 and infected with the HM/06 virus at 4 hpi. the effect of autophagy on viral polymerase activity was further investigated by using an influenza virus minireplicon system. A549 cells were transfected with siATG5 or siBECN1 for 36 h. after 4 hpi, cell lysates were collected for Western blot analysis. asterisk next to the blot indicates the protein. nuclei stained using 4\u2032,6\u2032-diamidino-2-phenylindole, then visualized by confocal microscopy. NP and M2 proteins induce autophagy and interact with LC3. NP is associated with viral RNA and RdRp and acts as a key structural determinant of vRNP. autophagic process to promote IAV replication at different stages of IAV replication. NP and M2 expression induced formation of multiple LC3 puncta. NP colocalized very well with the LC3 puncta in the cytoplasm. a549 cells were transfected with GFP-LC3 for 24 h. they then were mock-infected or infected with the HM/06 virus. twenty-four hours later, cells were fixed and stained with anti-NP or -M2 antibody. IAV induces autophagy via an AKT-mTOR signaling pathway (61) HM/06 virus infection resulted in time course changes in levels of AKT and phosphorylation of both its downstream substrate FKHR (Ser256) and p70S6K (Thr389) (a downstream effector of mTOR signaling) in A549 cells. NP and M2 mediated autophagy efficiently through the AKT-mTOR pathway. results showed that phosphorylation levels of whole AKT, mTOR, FKHR, and pS706K were significantly downregulated in either NP- or M2-transfected cells. autophagy promotes IAV RNA synthesis by regulating HSP90AA1 expression. autophagy induction increases HSP90AA1 expression in response to NP overexpression. NP-induced LC3-II increase was significantly depressed in HSP90AA1-knockdown cells compared to that of the NC-knockdown cells. lysates were harvested for Western blot analysis. PB2 coimmunoprecipitated with the endogenous HSP90AA1. NP and M2 mediate autophagy induction by modulating HSP90AA1 expression. this leads to an increase in viral RNA synthesis and vRNA synthesis. NP, an important subunit of vRNP complex, is involved in IAV assembly (5, 6). NP can physically interact with LC3 in both virus-infected cells and in cells coexpressing LC3. suppressing IAV infection-induced autophagy decreases vRNP export. NP and M2 mediate autophagosome accumulation by upregulating HSP90AA1 expression and regulating the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway. NP and M2 mediate autophagy through regulation of HSP90AA1 expression and the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway, which functions in different stages of viral replication. cells were maintained in Ham\u2019s F-12 medium, Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM; HyClone, China), and RPMI 1640 medium (HyClone, China), respectively. they were supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and incubated in a 37\u00b0C humidified incubator with 5% CO2. rabbit monoclonal anti-ATG7 (8558S; Cell Signaling Technology), mouse monoclonal anti-ATG5 (ARG54822; Arigo Biolaboratories, Taiwan), mouse monoclonal anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) secondary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. cDNAs encoding HM/06 NP, M2 and PB2 proteins were amplified by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) from total RNA extracted from A549 cells infected with HM/06 were cloned into HA-pCAGGS (HA-NP and HA-M2) or PCDNA3.1 (PCDNA3.1-PB2). t and immunoprecipitation (P0013; Beyotime) containing protease inhibitor cocktail (4693132001; Roche, Basel, Switzerland) were separated on SDS-PAGE gels and then electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (10600001 and 10600002; GE Healthcare Life Sciences) the signals were detected by using a WesternBright ECL detection kit (K-12045-D50; Advansta, USA) in an ECL detection system. siRNA-treated HEK 293T cells were cotransfected with the luciferase reporter plasmid pPoll-NP-Luc (pNP-Luc) and plasmids encoding PB1, PB2, PA, and NP of HM/06 virus. an internal control plasmid expressing Renilla luciferase (pGL4.75 hRluc/CMV) was also cotransfected. a green-based real-time PCR method was performed with an ABI ViiA 7 PCR system. expression of each gene was normalized to that of GAPDH. cells were obtained from the China Center for Type Culture Collection (Wuhan, China), and human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA) cells were maintained in Ham\u2019s F-12 medium, Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM; HyClone, China), and RPMI 1640 medium (HyClone, China), respectively. rabbit monoclonal anti-ATG7 (8558S; Cell Signaling Technology), mouse monoclonal anti-ATG5 (ARG54822; Arigo Biolaboratories, Taiwan), mouse monoclonal anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) secondary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. secondary antibodies were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. cDNAs encoding HM/06 NP, M2 and PB2 proteins were amplified by reverse transcription-PCR. cDNAs encoding HM/06 NP, M2 and PB2 proteins were amplified. mammalian cell lysis buffer (CW0889; CWBio) or cell lysis buffer for Western blotting and immunoprecipitation (P0013; Beyotime) containing protease inhibitor cocktail. proteins detected were separated on SDS-PAGE gels and then electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (10600001 and 10600002; GE Healthcare Life Sciences), which were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline with siRNA-treated HEK 293T cells were cotransfected with the luciferase reporter plasmid pPoll-NP-Luc (pNP-Luc) together with plasmids encoding PB1, PB2, PA, and NP of HM/06 virus. an internal control plasmid expressing Renilla luciferase (pGL4.75 hRluc/CMV) was also cotransfected. primer was used for quantification of NP and M vRNA, cRNA, and mRNA. expression of each gene was normalized to that of GAPDH."}
