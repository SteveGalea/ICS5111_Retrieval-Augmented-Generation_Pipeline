{"summary": "the prototypic early european strain of PEDV was first characterized from infected pigs in 1978 and was named CV777 [1] the virus is now classified as a member of the Alphacoronavirus genus within the family Coronaviridae. the virus has been propagated both in pigs and in vero cell cultures. both of these US variants of PEDV have been classified as being within genotype 2 based on complete genome sequences [5], while the early European strains, e.g. CV777, are in genotype 1. new cases have nearly all been caused by viruses closely related to just one of the two US variants. the resultant sequences have now been compared. the use of NGS on RNA isolated from infected cells also allowed evaluation of the sequences and relative levels of the various sub-genomic viral mRNAs. AF353511 nt / aa ANSES nt / aa APHA nt / aa APHA nt / aa FLI nt / aa IZSLER nt / aa 5'-UTR 8 A G ** G 28 A ** G 72 A Del Del Del Del Del Del Del Del Del Del Del Del Del Del 82\u201385 TCCT Del Del Del Del Del Del Del Del the 5 -terminal region of the Br1/87 sequence is rearranged upstream of nt 35. the loss of 2 nt results in the formation of a new termination codon that is predicted to result in the truncation of the ORF3 protein. the average coverage across the genome was about 1250 reads per nt. there were just 4 nt changes (all non-synonymous) within the coding sequence compared to the reference sequence. just 5 nt changes plus 3 separate deletions (3-52nt in length) were detected in the entire coding region. the average coverage across the genome was 122 reads per nt. about 20 nt changes from the reference sequence were present in the complete coding region. the IZSLER sequence is identical to the reference sequence throughout the entire length of ORF1a/1b (nt 297 to 20641, see Fig 1). the ANSES and DTU sequence only differ from the reference sequence within this region at nt 13917. the APHA sequence has up to 11 nt changes but at 3 of these positions, the sequencing indicated a mixed population. the spike protein that is produced by these strains lacks the usual seven C-terminal amino acid residues. a new termination codon is produced at the new junction of the sequences created by the deletion. this deletion removes the usual termination codon for ORF3 (indicated in italics) in ORF3 The 52 nt deletion in the IZSLER and FLI sequences, also removes the initiation codon for the ORF3 from these viruses. there is also a 3 nt deletion (nt 25201\u201325203) in the residual ORF3 coding sequence within the FLI strain which would make for an in-frame deletion. since the initiation codon is lost in this virus then this change is unlikely to have any consequence. the IZSLER sequence was heterogeneous at nt 25655 (within the E coding region) while the FLI sequence had a single nt change at nt 25992 (within the M coding region) no differences were detected in the 3'-UTRs in any of the sequences but the extent of sequence generated varied to some degree (as indicated above) evidence for more extensive rearrangement of the 5'-terminal sequence was found at the extreme end of the Br1/87 sequence. from nt 34 of the AF353511 reference sequence the different sequences align well but the reference sequence contains an insertion of one nt (nt 72) and a duplication of 4nt (see nt 82\u201389) that are absent in each of the other sequences. 74 and 119 different reads corresponded to this modified structure in the genomic RNA. this \u201creverse complement\u201d sequence was also identified in the leader sequences of the sub-genomic RNAs that allow the expression of the 6 different downstream ORFs. but when the sequence reads were mapped onto the reference CV777 consensus 5'-terminal sequence then just 8 and 28 reads matched the reference CV777 sequence. additional mapping of the Br1/87 sequences also identified reads that contained the \u201creverse complement\u201d of nt 11 up to approx. nt 88 of the reference sequence. this indicates that the 5 -terminal sequence of the Br1/87 RNA contains a modified leader sequence that spans from nt 11 and into stem loop 4 (SL4, see [21]) within the minority of reads that correspond to the reference CV777 sequence there is a single nt change (A to G self-complementary sequences present at the 5 -terminus of genomic and sub-genomic RNAs isolated from Br1/87 infected cells. each sequence shown is representative of multiple reads identified within the total collection of reads. colour coding of different regions of the RNA is similar to that used in Fig 5. Panel (b) a single contig of 27945 nt corresponding to the CV777 genome was assembled, de novo. the average coverage across the genome was about 953 reads per nt. just 5 nt changes plus 3 separate deletions (3-52nt in length) were detected in the entire coding region. the average coverage across the genome was 122 reads per nt. about 20 nt changes from the reference sequence were present in the complete coding region and a single 2 nt deletion. two single nt changes in sequence were also observed close to the 5'-terminus of the 5'-UTR. the average coverage across the genome was about 1250 reads per nt. there were just 4 nt changes (all non-synonymous) within the coding sequence compared to the reference sequence. the average coverage across the genome was about 953 reads per nt. just 5 nt changes plus 3 separate deletions (3-52nt in length) were detected in the entire coding region compared to the reference sequence. the average coverage across the genome was 122 reads per nt. the IZSLER sequence is identical to the reference sequence throughout the entire length of ORF1a/1b (nt 297 to 20641, see Fig 1). the ANSES and DTU sequence only differ from the reference sequence within this region at nt 13917. the APHA sequence has up to 11 nt changes but at 3 of these positions, the sequencing indicated a mixed population. spike protein that is produced by these strains lacks the usual seven C-terminal amino acid residues (FEKVHVQ) a new termination codon is produced at the new junction of the sequences created by the deletion. a single, non-synonymous, nt change is present in the APHA sequence. deletion in IZSLER and FLI sequences also removes the initiation codon for the ORF3 from these viruses. there is also a 3 nt deletion (nt 25201\u201325203) in the residual ORF3 coding sequence within the FLI strain which would make for an in-frame deletion. since the initiation codon is lost in this virus then this change is unlikely to have any consequence. the FLI sequence had a single coding change at nt 25992 (within the M coding region) the IZSLER sequence is identical to the reference sequence throughout the entire length of ORF1a/1b. the ANSES and DTU sequence only differ from the reference sequence within this region at nt 13917. just the IZSLER and FLI sequences share a 52nt deletion (nt 24765\u201324816) at the extreme 3'-terminus of the spike protein coding sequence. it is predicted that the spike protein produced by these strains lacks the usual seven C-terminal amino acid residues (FEKVHVQ) no extraneous amino acids will be present in the protein. iii) Variations in ORF3 The 52 nt deletion in the IZSLER and FLI sequences described above removes the initiation codon for the ORF3 from these viruses. there is also a 3 nt deletion (nt 25201\u201325203) in the residual ORF3 coding sequence within the FLI strain which would make for an in-frame deletion. the presence of this 2 nt deletion has been confirmed using a conventional RT-PCR ampli the ANSES, DTU and APHA sequences were identical to the reference sequence throughout this region. the IZSLER sequence was heterogeneous at nt 25655 (within the E coding region) while the FLI sequence had a single nt change at nt 25992 (within the M coding region) no differences were detected in the 3'-UTRs in any of the sequences. in the 5'-UTR, at nt positions 8 (A to G) and 28 (A to G), the same change at nt 8 was also found in the ANSES sequence. evidence for a more extensive rearrangement of the 5'-terminal sequence was found at the extreme end of the Br1/87 sequence (from DTU-Vet) nt 34 onwards, there is general agreement between the sequences and the core of the transcription regulatory sequence (TRS-L) motif (CUAAAC, nt 66\u201371) is conserved in all the sequences. however, nt 72 (an A) in the reference CV777 sequence (AF353511) is missing in all the other sequences, this nucleotide is immediately adjacent to the core sequence of the TRS-L. changes were found in the APHA sequence, marked in bold type, one change was shared with the ANSES sequence. the > symbol indicates that additional sequence is present (but not shown here) at the 5 terminus in the DTU sequence. structure, termed SL1, closest to the terminus, in the CV777 reference strain is indicated in panel (a) the sequence marked in blue is the \u201creverse complement\u201d of the sequence marked in red from panel (a) the conserved stems within SL1 are boxed but the apical loop region is distinct. the majority of genomes and the sub-genomic mRNAs produced within infected cells have a rearranged 5'-UTR compared to the consensus CV777 genome. however, the stem regions are completely conserved even though the upper stem in the Br1/87 sequence is the \u201creverse complement\u201d of the CV777 SL1 sequence. the locations of the SL1, the TRS and its complement (Anti-TRS) are indicated by boxes. extensive 5 -terminal stem-loop structures will also be present on the sub-genomic mRNAs as well. discussions Each of the PEDV sequences generated in this study are closely related to each other. in the APHA sequence, a 2 nt deletion within the ORF3 coding region is predicted to cause premature termination of the protein. 3 of the strains studied here do not seem to be able to produce an intact and functional ORF3 product. the br1/87 virus was found to contain a significantly different sequence at the 5'- terminus of the genome compared to the others. this does not appear to be a simple artefact since the derived sequence includes the \u201creverse complement\u201d of a part of the reference virus sequence. it is possible to predict an alternative, but closely related SL1 structure for the Br1/87 sequence that maintains the sequence of the two stems of the CV777 SL1. modified leader encodes the S protein with a higher efficiency than to the other sub-genomic mRNA sequences. it may be that the viral RNAs with the rearranged leader sequence act as defective interfering (DI) genomes. the production of coronavirus DI genomes within infected cells is well documented.
