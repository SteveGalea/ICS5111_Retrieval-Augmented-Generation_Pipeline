{"summary": "questionnaire self-administered by all HCWs in eight randomly selected non-academic acute general public hospitals. included questions on demographic and occupational characteristics, knowledge about the risks of acquiring and/or transmitting HAIs from/to a patient and standard precautions, and sources of information. between 5% and 10% of patients admitted to acute care hospitals acquire at least one infection. between 5% and 10% of patients admitted to acute care hospitals acquire at least one infection. over the last decades the incidence has increased in both the united states and Europe. all 550 HCWs working in the EDs were selected. the medical director and the ED head of each hospital received a letter with the description of the survey and requesting consent for the HCWs to participate. a self-administered anonymous questionnaire accompanied by an envelope to facilitate its return. after removing gloves are HAIs control measures (Model 2); perceived risk of acquiring a HAI from a patient (Model 3); using often or always gloves when at direct contact with a patient and hands hygiene measures after removing gloves (Model 4). in model 1, HCWs were classified as those who knew the risk for a HCW of acquiring both HCV and HIV infections from a patient versus all others. knowledge about the risk for a HCW of acquiring HCV and HIV infections from a patient (no = 0, yes = 1) and knowledge that invasive procedures are a risk factor for HAIs (no = 0, yes = 1) in Models 2-4; marital status (single/separated/divorced/widowed = 0, married = 1), number of other persons in the household (0 = 0, 1 = 1, 2 = 2, 3 = 3, 4 = 4, >4 = 5) independent variables included in all models: gender (male = 0, female = 1), age (continuous, in years), working category (physician = 0, nurse = 1), number of years in practice (continuous), number of patients seen in a workday (continuous), number of working hours in a week (continuous), knowledge about the risk for a HCW of transmitting HCV and HIV infections to a patient (no = 0, yes = 1). knowledge that the use of standard precautions is a HAIs control measure (no = 0, yes = 1) in Model 1; knowledge about the risk for a HCW of acquiring HCV and HIV infections from a patient. knowledge that invasive procedures are a risk factor for HAIs in Models 2-4; marital status (single/separated/divorced/widowed = 0, married = 1); number of other persons in the household (0 = 0, 1 = 1, 2 = 2, a total of 307 participants returned the questionnaire with a final response rate of 55.8%. two-thirds of the respondents were male, the mean age was 44 years, the mean number of years in practice was 11, and the mean number of patients seen in a day was 30. answers concerning the knowledge of HCWs are reported in Table 1. 86.3% were aware of both preventive measures and this knowledge was significantly higher in nurses (OR = 2.34; 95% CI 1.09-5.01) in nurses who provided care to fewer patients in a day (OR = 0.98; 95% CI 1.85-11.68), who knew that HCWs' hands are vehicle for transmission of nosocomial pathogens (OR = 4.64; 95% CI 1.85-11.68), and who did not know the risk for a HCW of i Tuberculosis (true) 48 15.6 B2a Hepatitis B (true) 45 14.7 B2f Mumps (true) 17 5.5 B2l Varicella (true) 16 5.2 B2e Measles (true) 14 4.6 Control measures B6 Wearing gloves, mask, and protective eyewear (true) 289 94.1 B4 Risk factors B7 Invasive procedures (true) 281 91.5 B8 HCW gloves are HAI's control measures Log likelihood = -98.84, 2 = 47.37 (6 df), p 0.0001 Not know the risk for a HCW of transmitting HCV and HIV infections to a patient 0.24 0.11-0.5 0.001 Know that HCWs hands are vehicle for transmission of nosocomial pathogens 4.64 1.85-11.68 0.001 Educational courses and scientific journals as sources of information about HAIs 3.54 1.47-8.5 0.005 HCWs who perceive a risk of acquiring a HAI from a patient F(10,296) = 4.88, p 0.0001, R2 = 14.2%, adjusted R2 = 11.3% Need of additional information about HAIs 1.23 3.86 0.001 Working as a nurse 0.66 3.01 0.003 Educational courses and scientific journals as sources of information about HAIs 0.76 2.43 0.016 Know that HCWs hands are vehicle for transmission of nosocomial pathogens 0. only 57.3% always wore gloves and 85.2% of them reported always changing gloves after each patient. a total of 80.8% of respondents often or always used gloves and performed hands hygiene measures after removing gloves. this behavior was more frequent in nurses (OR = 2.33; 95% CI 1.13-4.79), in fewer patients (OR = 0.97; 95% CI 0.95-0.99) participants' knowledge was generally high and consistent with current scientific evidence. there are wide areas where the knowledge was lower, particularly. regarding infections that a HCW can acquire from a patient and the standard precautions. a national telephone survey among orthopedic surgeons in accident and EDs found that 99% routinely used gloves in a major trauma scenario, but only 18% and 21% used face mask and eye protection. the attitudes towards HAIs are encouraging, since a high percentage of respondents reported positive global and specific beliefs. compliance to control measures was based solely on subjective views of HCWs with the possibility that they tend to over-report compliance. a final limitation was that the response rate of 55% was disappointingly low. a final limitation was that the response rate of 55% was disappointingly low.

Knowledges section of the questionnaire is designed to explore your knowledge related to health care-associated infections. hands hygiene after removing gloves is a HAIs control measure B5. wearing gloves, mask, and protective eyewear are a HAIs control measure B6. invasive procedures are a risk factor for HAIs B8. hands hygiene measures before going to another patient D7. Wearing protective eyewear when at direct contact with a patient D8. Wearing mask when at direct contact with a patient D8.
