{"summary": "IAV enters target cells via endocytosis, and virus-cell membrane fusion occurs at the late endosomes. membrane fusion occurs at the late endosomes, thus releasing the viral genome to start virus replication. proteolytic cleavage of HA0 into the HA1 and HA2 subunits is essential for HA to express membrane fusion activity. the HA of HP IAVs is cleaved by ubiquitous intracellular proteases such as furin and proprotein convertase 5/6. the concept of host protease-dependent tissue tropism and pathogenicity of LP and HP IAVs has been well established (7\u20139). pCAGGS-H1, -H3, -H5, and -H7 were generated by inserting cDNAs of the HA-coding region from mouse-adapted (MA) A/California/04/09 (MA-CA04[H1N1]) (17), MA-A/Guizhou-X (MA-GZX[H3N1]) (18), and A/Anhui/1/2013 (Anhui1[H7N9] 2 models were the human transmembrane serine protease hepsin (PDB accession number 1Z8G) the models were refined by energy minimization using Swiss-PdbViewer (22) and finally evaluated by PROCHECK (23) and Verify3D (24). cell fusion was analyzed by immunofluorescence staining using anti-IAV rabbit serum against H7, anti-IAV goat serum against H3, and HA-specific rabbit monoclonal antibodies the cells were cultured in methionine-cysteine-deficient medium for 1 h. then pulse labeled with [35S]methionine-cysteine by using EasyTag EXPRE35S35S35S protein labeling mix (PerkinElmer) for 1 h. all cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer. TMPRSS2 KO mice with a homologous genotype were obtained by crossing male and female TMPRSS2+/ C57BL/6 mice. transcriptome analysis. bronchi and right middle lobes of the lung were obtained from uninfected healthy wild-type (WT) and KO (TMPRSS2/) mice (6-week-old females) monolayers of MDCK cells in 12-well plates were infected with virus samples for 1 h at 4\u00b0C, washed twice with PBS, overlaid with DMEM\u20131% agarose. at 24 h postinfection, the cell monolayers were additionally overlaid with DMEM\u20131% agarose supplemented with 2.0 g/ml of trypsin to allow plaque formation. mice were challenged with 4.0 103 PFU of MA-CA04[H1N1] or 6.8 103 PFU of MA-GZX[H3N2]. three mice were used for each experimental group. the RNA-seq reads of the lung tissues from WT and TMPRSS2 KO mice are available at the DDBJ Sequence Read Archive under accession number DRA001103. all experiments with animals were performed in strict accordance with the animal experimentation guidelines of the national institute of infectious diseases. HeLa cells were transfected with pTarget-mTMPRSS2 or pcDNA-TMPRSS2. geneticin-resistant stable clones were selected in the presence of 1.0 mg/ml of geneticin. no known structures of mTMPRSS2 or hTMPRSS2 are available. monolayers of 293T cells were transfected with an HA-expressing plasmid (pCAGGS-H1, -H3, -H5) and a TMPRSS2-expressing plasmid (pTarget-mTMPRSS2 or pcDNA-TMPRSS2) at 20 h posttransfection, the cells were cultured in methionine-cysteine-deficient medium for 1 h and pulse labeled with [35S] TMPRSS2 gene KO C57BL/6 embryonic stem (ES) cells were obtained from the Knockout Mouse Project (KOMP) Repository (UC Davis) chimeric mice were selected by VelociGene KOMP allele PCR genotyping strategies by using primers NeoFwd and SD. RNA strand-specific transcriptome sequencing libraries were prepared from 50 ng of the purified poly(A) mRNA using a ScriptSeq v2 RNA-Seq Library Preparation kit (Epicentre) the prepared RNA-seq library was sequenced by using a GAIIx sequencer (Illumina) the obtained strand-specific short reads were analyzed by CLC Genome Workbench (v. 6.05) KO (TMPRSS2/) and WT (TMPRSS2+/+) mice were challenged with MA-CA04[H1N1], MA-GZX[H3N2], VN1194[H5N1], or Anhui1[H7N9]. for each experimental group, 4 to 6 mice were used to monitor body weight. 103 PFU (1.0 102 LD50) of MA-GZX[H5N1], 1.0 104 PFU (1.0 102 LD50) of VN1194[H5N1], or 4.0 106 PFU (1.0 102 LD50) of Anhui1[H7N9]; autopsied at 2 and 6 dpi. three mice were used for each experimental group. immunoblotting. TMPRSS2 and mTMPRSS2 were strongly suggested to have similar substrate specificities. but the TMPRSS2 structures were strictly models, and biological analyses were performed. the analyses showed that all HAs of LP IAVs of the H1, H3 and H7 subtypes were cleaved by both mTMPRSS2 and hTMPRSS2. TMPRSS2 KO mice exhibited normal reproduction, development, and growth patterns, similar to previously reported TMPRSS2 KO mice with a deletion of exons 10 to 13 in the TMPRSS2 gene (25). TMPRSS2 KO mice possess an allele [Tmprss2tm1(KOMP)Vlcg] with an ablating deletion of the TMPRSS2 gene. gene RPKM Lungs Bronchi WT KO WT KO TTSPs Tmprss2 2.43 0.59a 3.62 0.51a Tmprss3 0.00 0.00 0.21 0.00 Tmprss4 0.54 0.64 0.61 0.40 Tmprss5 0.05 0.21 1.61 0.38 Tmprss6 0.01 0.00 0.02 0.05 Tmprss7 0.39 0.00 0.01 0.03 Tmprss all TMPRSS2 KO mice inoculated with 102 PFU (7.5 LD50) of MA-CA04[H1N1] died or required euthanasia. TMPRSS2 KO mice were also highly tolerant of lethal challenge infections with MA-GZX[H3N2]. data obtained by hematoxylin and eosin staining (magnification, 10) (E and F) and immunohistochemistry for the IAV nucleocapsid protein (magnification, 10) (G and H) are shown. inflammation scores of individual mice (n = 3) are shown at the bottom of each panel. TMPRSS2 KO mice were infected with 4.0 103 PFU (3.0 102 LD50) of MA-CA04[H1N1] or 6.8 103 PFU (1.0 102 LD50) of MA-GZX[H3N2. lung lavage fluids were collected from mice infected with MA-CA04[H1N1] and analyzed for HA protein. at 2 dpi, the virus titers of MA-CA04[H1N1] and MA-GZX[H3N2] reached their peak levels in WT mice. the virus titers in the lungs of TMPRSS2 KO mice were much lower than those in the lungs of TMPRSS2 KO mice. TMPRSS2 is essential for LP H7N9 IAV, but dispensable for HP H5N1 IAV, to exhibit pathogenicity. pathogenicity of a human isolate of an emerging LP H7N9 subtype virus, Anhui1[H7N9], was also analyzed. WT and TMPRSS2 KO mice were intranasally inoculated with different doses of anhui1[H7N9] (A) or VN1194[H5N1] (B) (n = 4 to 6). the body weights were measured daily. Error bars represent standard deviations. a human isolate of an HP H5N1 subtype virus, VN1194[H5N1], caused severe body weight loss, neurological symptoms, and death or requirement for euthanasia by 8 or 9 dpi. a human isolate of an HP H5N1 subtype virus, VN1194[H5N1], caused severe body weight loss, neurological symptoms, and death or requirement for euthanasia by 8 or 9 dpi. hTMPRSS2 showed strong conservation of amino acid residues near the protease active site. these proteases were strongly suggested to have similar substrate specificities. but the TMPRSS2 structures were strictly models, and biological analyses were performed. TMPRSS2 KO mice exhibited normal reproduction, development, and growth patterns, similar to previously reported TMPRSS2 KO mice with a deletion of exons 10 to 13 in the TMPRSS2 gene (25). TMPRSS2 KO mice exhibited normal reproduction, development, and growth patterns, similar to previously reported TMPRSS2 KO mice with a deletion of exons 3 to 13 of the TMPRSS2 gene. allele PCR genotyping strategies using primers NeoFwd and SD. previously reported method using primers P11 and P12 (25) MA viruses of human LP IAV strains MA-CA04[H1N1] and MA-GZX[H3N2] were inoculated intranasally into WT and TMPRSS2 KO mice. all TMPRSS2 KO mice infected with 105 PFU (7.5 103 LD50) of MA-GZX[H3N2] showed moderate body weight loss but recovered completely. TMPRSS2 KO mice infected with the same viruses developed bronchiolitis and peribronchial inflammation. the lungs of KO mice infected with the same viruses exhibited significantly reduced levels of inflammation. TMPRSS2 KO mice were infected with 4.0 103 PFU (3.0 102 LD50) of MA-CA04[H1N1] or 6.8 103 PFU (1.0 102 LD50) of MA-GZX[H3N2] at 6 dpi. lung lavage fluids were collected from mice infected with MA-CA04[H1N1] and analyzed for HA protein. lung lavage fluids at 2, 4, and 6 dpi and lung homogenates at 2 dpi were treated or untreated with trypsin in vitro. at 2 dpi, the virus titers of MA-CA04[H1N1] and MA-GZX[H3N2] reached their peak levels in WT mice. PRSS2 KO mice were intranasally inoculated with MA-CA04[H1N1] (n = 3) or MA-GZX[H3N2] (n = 3). TMPRSS2 is essential for LP H7N9 IAV, but dispensable for HP H5N1 IAV, to exhibit pathogenicity. pathogenicity of an emerging LP H7N9 subtype virus, Anhui1[H7N9], was also 106 PFU of anhui1[H7N9] showed that Anhui1[H7N9] spread poorly in the lungs of TMPRSS2 KO mice. WT and TMPRSS2 KO mice were challenged with different doses of anhui1[H7N9] (C) or VN1194[H5N1] (B) (n = 4 to 6). the body weights were measured daily. a human isolate of an HP H5N1 subtype virus, VN1194[H5N1], caused severe body weight loss, neurological symptoms, and death or requirement for euthanasia by 8 or 9 dpi. the survival curves of WT and TMPRSS2 KO mice infected with 102 PFU (2.0 103 LD50) of VN1194[H5N1] were also similar to one another. e-origin LP H1N1 and H7N9 IAVs and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus are potential threats for humans. TMPRSS2 expression is essential for in vivo replication of emerging H7N9 and seasonal IAVs. this protease primarily determines IAV pathogenicity. TMPRSS2 is a good target for the development of anti-LP IAV drugs. the membrane-anchoring and cytoplasmic domains of TTSPs regulate cellular trafficking and localization of TTSPs. TTSPs play critical roles in developmental stages and physiological events. TTSPs have a clear substrate specificity (37) however, various respiratory viruses, including the SARS coronavirus (12, 42\u201344), MERS coronavirus (14), human metapneumovirus (11), and parainfluenza viruses (13) also use TMPRSS2 for activation."}
