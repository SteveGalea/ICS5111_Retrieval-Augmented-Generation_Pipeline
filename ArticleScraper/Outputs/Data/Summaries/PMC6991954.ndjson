{"summary": "the global mAb market reached US$100 billion annually in 2017. the success of mAbs starts with the general applicability of the technology used to make them. mAbs are particularly good at targeting cell-surface proteins and circulating protein factors. antibodies can be generated that are specific for the invading pathogen. this lack of cross-reactivity with human tissue can be confirmed by immunohistochemistry. this is in stark contrast to small molecules, in which unexpected on- and off-target safety signals are often seen in the later stages of clinical development. anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) antibodies used in rheumatoid arthritis. first candidate to be approved was infliximab, initially approved for intravenous use at a dose of 3 mg/kg. adalimumab has taken over as the market leader, with an injection every 2 weeks. mAbs are becoming sufficiently affordable to be relevant in neglected diseases. production efficiency of mAbs has increased dramatically over recent decades. costs of mAb production are dropping from US$300/g to US$20/g. mAbs are becoming sufficiently affordable to be relevant in neglected diseases. mAbs used in therapy are generally IgGs (immunoglobulin Gs), which have plasma half-lives of 20 to 25 days in humans. such antibodies can be used to provide several months of protection. alternative to simply increasing the dose would be increasing the half-life of the circulating mAb. many pathogens will not raise an adequate immune response, due to immunosuppression. antibodies would thus form part of the overall armamentarium, along with drugs, bed nets and insecticides, and vaccines. challenge to developing mAbs is the question of suitable antigen targets. polyclonal antibodies have been approved in the u.s. for cytomegalovirus, hepatitis viruses A and C, and postexposure prophylaxis against measles, rabies, rubella, and tetanus [31] there are fewer marketed antibodies that target bacteria, and these target toxins, namely anthrax and Clostridium cytotoxin [27]. the discovery of mAbs in this area logically follows the long-standing therapeutic successes with passive immunization. the costs and feasibility of developing mAbs were recently reviewed [34, 37][38] including specific clinical development and regulatory challenges. the present vaccine discovery statuses for these diseases are listed in Table 1. trypanosomiasis No An antibody\u2013drug conjugate was active in vivo [60] TB The BCG vaccine (partially active) the biggest success story has been the use of antibodies to provide prophylaxis against infection by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) a follow-on antibody is 100 times more potent than palivizumab in vitro. mAbs are becoming sufficiently affordable to be relevant in neglected diseases. an injection volume of 1.0 ml is probably close to the maximum acceptable in small children. the cost of goods of an injection based on current numbers would be in the range of US$1 to US$8. the recently launched malaria vaccine provides less than 50% protection for 3 injections at around US$5 each. mutations derived from the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) increase the strength of the interaction between the Fc region and the Fc receptors under the acidic pH conditions in lysosomes. as a result, the receptor\u2013Fc complex is recycled back to the cell surface, escaping degradation. mAbs that target the initial stages of an infection may provide prophylaxis. rabies virus avoids apoptosis of infected neurons while killing protective T cells so that carriers do not mount an immune response themselves. brucei (which causes sleeping sickness) and Plasmodium (malarial parasites) encode dozens or even hundreds of different surface antigens that are sequentially exposed at their most abundant stage. raxibacumab has been approved using the FDA \u201cAnimal Rule\u201d [33]. this provides a route forward in disease areas in which trials with infected human patients are not possible or not ethical. HIV No One mAb (ibalizumab [13] has been approved. eight mAb checkpoint inhibitors are in human trials. TB The BCG vaccine (partially active) there are over 200 million cases annually in africa, with two-thirds being Schistosoma haematobium and the remainder being S. mansoni. in Southeast Asia, other species such as S. japonicum and S. mekongi cause smaller numbers of infections. no target-product profile (TPP) for prophylaxis against schistosomiasis has been published. clinically, this treatment reduces infection by 70% to 80% using doses of 40 to 60 mg/kg. a vaccine based on Sm-TSP-2 (Schistosoma mansoni-tetraspanin-2) is not expected to report before 2023. the initial immune response is a characteristically strong T helper 2 cytokine reaction. the cytokines that are released include interleukin (IL)-5, which drives the production of eosinophils to attack the parasite. injection of mice with paramyosin provides protection against infection. schistosomes express glycans as part of their glycoprotein and glycolipid repertoire. schistosomes also express a large number of glycans as part of their glycoprotein and glycolipid repertoire. mAbs developed for the following significant fungal pathogens are Cryptococcus, Pneumocystis and Paracoccidioides. the clinical use of anti-IL17 in rheumatoid arthritis clearly exacerbates fungal infection. mortality in infected patients has not declined. the ability of mAbs to protect against a lethal cryptococcal infection in mice was first demonstrated over three decades ago. mAb 18B7 was evaluated in a Phase I clinical trial [50] and was found to produce a modest reduction in circulating cryptococcal antigen. further development has been hampered, however, by difficulties in securing funding for a disease for which financial returns are likely to be low. mAbs raised to asymptomatic carriers make Pneumocystis an attractive target for immunoprophylaxis. passive immunization studies have been initiated using mAbs raised to Pneumocystis epitopes. paracoccidioides brasiliensis is the most important cause of IFIs in Latin America. candidate albicans is the most commonly isolated fungal pathogen globally. it is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients with HIV or tuberculosis (TB) infection. mAbs offer tremendous potential to augment the antifungal arsenal. gue dengue fever is a viral infection found in tropical and subtropical regions around the world. the dengue virus is transmitted by female mosquitoes, mainly of the species Aedes aegypti. there are 4 distinct serotypes\u2014DENV-1 to DENV-4\u2014of the virus. non-neutralizing levels of anti-DENV antibody can enhance viral entry into host cells by forming a DENV-antibody complex. there is concern that an incomplete antibody against DENVs may cause ADE-mediated severe dengue disease. mAb therapy is an alternative to vaccines and other therapies against dengue. domain II showed strong neutralizing activity against all 4 serotypes. but at subneutralizing concentrations, it also elicited ADE activity in vitro. the modified antibody kept the same cross-neutralizing activity to all 4 serotypes. the role of protective antibodies in malaria was demonstrated over 40 years ago. malaria could prevent the entry (initial infection) of the parasite, block entry of the sporozoites into the liver cells, block entry of the merozoites into the erythrocytes, or block the uptake of the gametocytes into the mosquito. there are 3 mAbs published with potent activity against the circumsporozoite protein, CSP, and these can reduce the parasitaemia in sporozoite-infected mice that carry a human liver implant. these mAbs include mAb317, cloned from B cells obtained from a patient in the recent RTS,S vaccine trial [133], CIS43 (circumsporozoite protein 43 [56]), and a set that included MGU two such mAbs are in Phase III trials: PRO 140 and Cenicriviroc. ibalizumab recently approved as a second-line treatment for HIV treatment. the role of protective antibodies in malaria was demonstrated over 40 years ago. the role of protective antibodies in malaria is well described [130, 131] malaria is the most interesting place to intervene with an mAb. there are 3 mAbs published with potent activity against the circumsporozoite protein, CSP, and these can reduce the parasitaemia in sporozoite-infected mice that carry a human liver implant. these mAbs include mAb317, cloned from B cells obtained from a patient in the recent RTS,S vaccine trial [133], CIS43 (circumsporozoite protein 43 [56]), and a set that included MGU the case for HIV was recently reviewed [139, 140]. two such mAbs are in Phase III trials. PRO 140 targets CCR5 (cysteine-cysteine chemokine receptor type 5). the cost of an antibody injection is starting to enter the range of US$1 to US$10. new technologies with viral delivery offer the promise that a single injection could give protection for even longer periods. a systematic attempt is needed to identify antibodies resulting from successful control of an infection in patients. the tide has changed, and clinical diagnosis now is such that medicines with a high degree of selectivity and specificity are often preferred. this shift to highly specific medicines favors the use of mAbs."}
