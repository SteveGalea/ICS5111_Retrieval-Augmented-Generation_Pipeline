{"summary": "the family is divided into the Entomopoxvirinae and the Chordopoxvirinae subfamilies of viruses, which infect insects and vertebrates. 11 genera have been created to classify Chordopoxviruses. other viruses remain unclassified and new genera are likely to be recognized in the future. virological investigations focused on poxviruses in bat populations may have a positive impact on future ecological studies of bat\u2013pathogen interactions. phylogenetic analyses suggest that HYPV belongs to the Chordopoxvirinae subfamily, revealing the highest similarity (85%) with Eptesipoxvirus (EPTV) detected from the microbat Eptesicus fuscus in WA, USA in 2011. the bats were taxonomically identified based on their morphologic characteristics, according to the European bat identification keys [15] the carcasses were necropsied, and tissue samples were collected for further laboratory exams. samples were inoculated in confluent monolayers of VERO and MARC 145 cells. libraries were sequenced on a MiSeq Instrument (Illumina Inc. San Diego, CA, USA) by using a MiSeq Reagent Kit v2 in a 250 cycle paired-end run. data were assembled de novo by the CLC Genomic workbench v.11 (Qiagen S.p.A., Milan, Italy) cell culture supernatants showed CPE were partially purified by ultracentrifugation at 35,000 rpm for 2 h (rotor TST41 Kontron) this antigen was kept at 70 \u00b0C and then submitted for viral identification with the NGS approach and negative-staining electron microscopy (nsEM) the sick bat was originally found alive on July 17, 2017 in Telgate, northern Italy. it had a humerus fracture, sensory depression and a lack of appetite. the death occurred 54 days after admission to the center on September 9, 2017. rounded cells floating in the culture medium of MARC 145 cells infected with the pool of bat organs (heart and lungs) at three days after inoculation (original magnification 100); (B) mock cells (original magnification 100); (C) negative-staining electron microscopy showing the presence of a virion morphologically related to the Orthopoxvirus genus. the nearly complete viral genome of a poxvirus was obtained from one contig of 166,600 nucleotides originating from 85,678 reads with an average coverage of 118.53. the nearly complete genome sequence of the viral strain was determined and compared with those of other members of the Poxviridae family available on GenBank. a total of 161 genes were annotated for HYPV, showing a percentage value of nt identity with its closest related virus EPTV. HYPV genome annotation and nucleotide identities for each gene to the most similar strain Eptesipoxvirus.

HYPV showed nucleotide divergence from its closest relative, EPTV. the smaller genome size with 166,600 nt encoding 161 genes for HYPV is likely due to the omission of the ITRs. a novel poxvirus, HYPV, was detected from the microbat Hypsugo savii in Italy. this likely represents the first poxvirus detection in bat populations worldwide. only four poxviruses have been documented to date in bat populations worldwide. post-mortem examination revealed multiple nodules on the wing membranes. phylogenetic analysis indicated that PTPV is not closely related to any other poxvirus isolated from bats or other species. EPTV and HYPV were isolated from microbats. the percentage value of the nt identity of HYPV with EPTV ranged from 42.5% for the HYPV-2 gene (serpin 2) to 100% for the HYPV-90 gene (VLTF-3). a new poxvirus, HYPV, was detected in bats in european bats."}
