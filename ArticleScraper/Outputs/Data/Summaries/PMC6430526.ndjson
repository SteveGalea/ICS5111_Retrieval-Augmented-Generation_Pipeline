{"summary": "more than 30,000 viruses have been identified and classified into 125 different virus families. many more are yet to be identified and investigated. the mud crab Scylla paramamosain is an economically important aquaculture species in china, India, Australia, and many other countries. a different virus with distinct features different from those of MCDV, but almost the same size as MCDV, was unexpectedly observed and identified. previous reports revealed the existence of MCDV (3, 4) and MCRV (5) in mud crabs with SD, with diameters of 30 and 72 nm, respectively. the results confirm the presence of two kinds of virus with different protrusions. the results implied that there might be another unknown virus in the purified sample similar in size to MCDV. further 3D classification and 50 cycles of refinement and reconstruction using RELION 2.0 also revealed two types of particles. all subunits aligned well except for terminal regions in type II virus. the capsid of the type II virus is composed of one protein arranged in T=3 icosahedral symmetry. the disk feature (colored gold) is composed of VP4, attached to the inner face of the 5-fold axis, comprising the N termini of VP3 subunits. previous reports revealed the existence of MCDV in crabs with SD (4). the C terminus and CD loop of each VP1 subunit around the 5-fold axis stretch away from the major capsid surface. the N terminus of VP2 extends across the 2-fold axis and interdigitates with the neighboring VP2 subunit. so, the N terminus of VP2 binds the adjacent VP3 and VP3 subunits together. MCDV shares 60.2% amino acid sequence identity with TSV. a stable VP4 disk-like structure was seen only in IAPV and CrPV. a stable VP4 disk-like structure was seen only in IAPV and CrPV. the presence of protrusions in MCDV may be related to its host. among reported dicistroviruses, only MCDV and TSV have an extralong C terminus. the genome of MCDV can be released by heating. density maps reveals two linked-block densities (orange and purple arrows) for each protrusion around the 5-fold axis in both full unheated and heated particles. however, in empty heated particles, only one block density (purple arrow) and more free space around the 5-fold axis. the type II virus harbors a single positive single-strand RNA (+ssRNA) genome. the genome of the type II virus harbors one sequence that contains three ORFs and encodes only one capsid protein. the results suggest that MCDV and the type II virus are entirely separate species. number of MCTV genome copies in hemocytes of mud crabs at 4, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h postinoculation. each bar represents the mean standard deviation of three samples. overall structure of the type II virus. the capsid protein of MCTV includes an N-terminal region, an S-domain, and a C-terminal P-domain. the S-domain has eight -strands (B to I) the density of the N terminus could be only partly traced. ae-like viruses Macrobrachium rosenbergii nodavirus (MrNV; GenBank accession number ACY26145), Penaeus vannamei nodavirus (PvNV; NCBI protein database accession number YP_004207809), wenzhou tombus-like virus 18 (NCBI protein database accession number YP_009342271), Wenling tombus-like virus 4 (NCBI protein database accession number YP the hexamer is composed of three VPb subunits (B1, B2, and B3) and three VPc subunits (C1, C2, and C3). three neighboring VPc subunits interact with the hexamer via -augmentation. a conserved proline close to the 3-fold axis plays an important role in stabilizing the structure. in the middle of the trident, a conserved proline close to the 3-fold axis plays an important role in stabilizing the structure. a conserved proline close to the 3-fold axis plays an important role in stabilizing the structure. differences around the 3-fold axis may provide a basis for classification of these viruses. MCTV forms a trident structure; nodamura viruses have three helices. in previously reported tombus-like and noda-like viruses, there are two different types of protrusions. in the first type, the C termini of VPa, VPb, and VPc protrude from the quasi-3-fold axis of the asymmetric unit, forming a \u201cVPa-VPb-VPc\u201d trimeric protrusion. the betanodavirus member GNNV VLP has 60 protrusions organized in this way (18 previous reports revealed the existence of MCDV (3, 4) and MCRV (5) in mud crabs with SD, with diameters of 30 and 72 nm. MCDV belongs to the family Dicistroviridae and harbors at least three different capsid proteins: VP1, VP2, and VP3. the results of 25 iterations of reference-free two-dimensional (2D) classification using RELION 2.0 were carefully rechecked. it became apparent that the sample probably contained two different viruses based on the shape of the protrusions. further 3D classification and 50 cycles of refinement and reconstruction using RELION 2.0 also revealed two types of particles. dicistrovirus (MCDV) overall structure of MCDV. protrusions (black arrow) are highlighted and rendered at an isodensity contour level of 1.5. the color scheme is the same as that in panel A. amino acids 3 to 190 of VP1, amino acids 4 to 253 of VP2, amino acids 3 to 57 of VP4 and the shell domain (S-domain) of VP3 could be traced. residues 253 to 447 of VP3 which is exposed on the capsid surface could not be traced due to high flexibility. terminus of VP2 binds adjacent VP2 and VP3 subunits together. five N-terminal regions of VP3 are twisted around the 5-fold axis. one remarkable feature of MCDV is that VP3 has an additional 200 amino acids at the C terminus. structures of four other dicistroviruses have been determined to date. a stable VP4 disk-like structure was seen only in IAPV and CrPV. a stable VP4 disk-like structure was seen only in IAPV and CrPV. the genome of MCDV can be released by heating. previous studies revealed that the genome could be released by heating. we then heated a mixture of MCDV and the type II virus to 56\u00b0C for 0.5 h. MCDV particles could then be further classified into two (empty and full) groups. map of full unheated particles was low pass filtered to 6.8, similar to that of heated particles. density maps reveals two linked-block densities (orange and purple arrows) for each protrusion around the 5-fold axis. in empty heated particles, only one block density (purple arrow) and more free space around the 5-fold axis. MCTV is an infectious agent (rather than a contaminant) in crabs. real-time PCR was used to measure MCTV loads in the hepatopancreas and hemocytes of MCTV-injected crabs at different times. at 96 h post-MCTV infection, the mortality rate was about 60%. b and VPc constitute alternating hexamers around the icosahedral 3-fold axes. protrusions are highlighted, rendered at an isodensity contour level of 1.5. Capsid proteins VPa, VPb, and VPc are colored purple, blue, and orange. three short strands (1 to 3) in the N-terminal region of VPc could be identified and form an N-arm. it was impossible to build accurate models of the P-domains due to high flexibility. ion-binding motif common among tombusviruses, sobemoviruses, and nodaviruses. most chelate one or two ions via a homologous motif at a similar position (16\u201318) this is thought to be key interaction for capsid assembly and stability. -augmentation can be formed, indicated in the two (magenta and blue) colored boxes. one type (magenta box) is composed of F of B2, 3 of C4, and 2 of C5. the other type (blue box) is composed of I, B of C1, and 1 of C5. interactions around the 3-fold axis are critical for the assembly and stability of the capsids. MCTV exhibited higher stability than MCDV; most MCTV particles did not lose their RNA genome. this indicates the presence of powerful interactions between subunits. MCTV has 30 prominent dimeric protrusions extending from the surface at the 2-fold axis of the capsid. the resolution of the protrusions is somewhat lower than that of the major capsid structure, indicating higher flexibility. type, a pair of C termini from neighboring subunits from different asymmetric units protrudes and interacts with each other, forming a coherent network with 90 protrusions. protrusions composed of VPa and VPb are close to the 5-fold axis, while protrusions composed of the two termini of VPc are located at the 2-fold axis. molecular probe- or antigen-based detection can often miss additional pathogens present in cases of dual or multiple infections. MCDV shares several typical structural features with picornaviruses. on capsid surface of human rhinovirus 14 and other similar picornaviruses, there is a hydrophobic pocket in VP1 which is a target of some inhibitors. MCTV may belong to a novel virus class that is closely related to Tombusviridae and Nodaviridae in terms of taxonomy. however, virus taxonomy requires more extensive morphological and molecular biological evidence. two-month-old mud crabs (100 10 g) were collected from a farm in china. the experimental group received an intramuscular injection of MCTV. nine crabs were selected randomly at each time point (4, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h postinoculation) pMD-19T vector was serially diluted to obtain a standard curve. each assay was carried out in triplicate. the mean and standard deviation of the replicate real-time PCR values were determined. a total of 74,880 particles (30 nm in diameter) were selected from 3,470 CCD cryo-EM frames captured by the Titan Krios instrument. 14,000 heated particles from 552 CCD frames were collected using the e2boxer.py program in EMAN2 (36) curves for MCDV and MCTV are colored red and blue. heated empty MCDV and heated full MCDV are colored red and blue. models were predicted using Phyre2 server (43) pellets were resuspended in PBS and loaded onto a 15% to 45% (wt/wt) CsCl gradient and ultracentrifuged for 2 h at 200,000 g for 8 h at 4\u00b0C. pellets were checked by negative staining with a transmission electron microscope. the primers were based on the MCTV sequence (MCTV-qPCR CGGAAGCGACTACCTTGGT and MCTV-qPCR CGATGGGCTCACGGATAAGA) each assay was carried out in triplicate. the mean and standard deviation of the three replicate real-time PCR values were determined. a total of 74,880 particles (30 nm in diameter) were selected from 3,470 CCD cryo-EM frames. 14,000 heated particles from 552 CCD frames were collected using the e2boxer.py program in EMAN2 (36) the resolution of the maps was evaluated using the \u2018\u2018gold standard\u2019\u2019 Fourier shell correlation (FSC) at 0.143 criterion (41, 42) the resolutions of the MCDV, MCTV, and heated full and empty MCDV are 3.5, 3.3, 6.8, and 6.6, respectively. the curves for MCDV and MCTV are colored red and blue, respectively."}
