{"summary": "diseases caused by aetiologic agents of respiratory distress, stunted growth, and drop in egg production cause great economic losses to poultry producers worldwide. notable infectious agents that have been implicated in respiratory infections of poultry include avian influenza virus (AIV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV), Mycoplasma spp., avian metapneumovirus, infectious laryngotracheitis virus, and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) several circulating serotypes of the virus have been identified in poultry worldwide. the most prevalent serotype worldwide is the Massachusetts-type (Mass) commonly used as a vaccine candidate. IB remains the most commonly reported respiratory disease of poultry globally. IB is less studied and understood with only a few reports available in the public domain on the epidemiology and control in the country. recent reports of rampant occurrences of respiratory diseases and drop in egg production have risen in Plateau state, Nigeria. lungs, trachea, liver, and spleen were harvested for virological examination. at the time of this investigation, the flock size stood at 1,062 laying chickens. primers targeting matrix (M) gene were used to amplify AIV, NDV and IBV. the 5\u2032-untranslated region was amplified in IBV. IBV was amplified using a one-Step RT-PCR protocol (Qiagen, Germany) in a 25-l reaction mixture containing 5.0 l of 5 PCR buffer, 1.0 l dNTP mix (10 mM each), 0.5 l of each primer (10 M), 0.5 l of each primer (10 M), 0.5 l RT-PCR Enzyme Mix, 5.0 l of RNA template and nuclease-free water. 32 blood samples were obtained via the brachial vein of the chickens. the samples were left to clot in a slanted position and separated sera were decanted into sterile tubes afterward. the sera were screened using a panel of IBV antigens and antisera. ND, infectious bursal disease, fowl typhoid, and Fowl pox were administered. there was no record of initial priming with live attenuated oil-emulsion vaccine. birds came into lay at the age of 22 wk and production never reached 80%. RNA extracts were eluted in 60-l elution buffer according to manufacturer's instructions. primers targeting the matrix (M gene) were used to amplify AIV and NDV. the 5\u2032-untranslated region was amplified in IBV. IBV was amplified using a one-Step RT-PCR protocol (Qiagen, Germany) in a 25-l reaction mixture containing 5.0 l of 5 PCR buffer, 1.0 l dNTP mix (10 mM each), 0.5 l of each primer (10 M), 0.5 l of each primer (10 M), 0.5 l RT-PCR Enzyme Mix, 5.0 l of RNA template and nuclease-free water. allantoic fluids (ALFs) were harvested after 5 d of incubation at 37\u00b0C. embryos were observed for IB lesions which include stunted growth. mortality was observed before the birds came into lay with a range of 1%\u20132%. at post-mortem, lesions include cloudy air sacs, frothy and congested lungs, whitish, cheesy materials on the serosal surface of the intestine, white nodules on the surface of the ventricles, proventriculus and intestines, and presence of ascitic fluid in the abdomen. ND was first suspected due to its enzootic status in Nigeria. successful isolation of IBV in embryonating eggs was accomplished after four blind passages with the embryos developing lesions characteristic of IB such as stunting and dwarfing. birds were vaccinated with inactivated oil-emulsion vaccine which contained IBV antigen. this seemed not to have protected birds against morbidity, mortality, and decreased egg production. HI results for the three serotypes (Mass, Conn, and Ark) tested in this study revealed 100% seropositivity. this clearly shows that the three IBV serotypes are present in the farm and may be in circulation in Plateau State with the possibility of other hitherto unreported serotypes. infectious bronchitis virus serotypes report from a commercial farm exhibiting respiratory distress and drop in egg production. the authors declare that there is no conflict of interest."}
