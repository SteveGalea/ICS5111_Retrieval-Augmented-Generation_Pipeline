{"summary": "the avirulent feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) and the virulent feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) are important pathogens of domestic cat populations worldwide. FCoVs have two serotypes (12, 24, 27, 30), and both occur in two pathotypes. most authors suspect a role for the ORF3abc region in the development of FIP. cDNA copy of full-length infectious clone of FIPV DF-2 was cloned into a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) the original truncated ORF3abc of DF-2 was replaced with an intact, genetically closed orthologous ORF3abc obtained from canine coronavirus (CCoV) Elmo/02 (39). 0.2 mM glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, 0.25 g/ml amphotericin B, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 1% nonessential amino acids were isolated. cells were seeded in a 24-well dish at a density of 2 106 cells/ml and cultivated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. the titers were calculated as 50% tissue culture infectious doses (TCID50)/ml with the Reed and Muench method (40). the CCoV Elmo/02 strain was kindly provided by canio Buonavoglia (University of Bari, Italy). RNA was extracted from virus stocks using the QIAamp viral RNA minikit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) by following the manufacturer's instructions. maximum-efficiency DH10B competent Escherichia coli cells were transformed by heat shock according to manufacturer's instructions. the BAC vector and recombinant BACs were isolated with the Qiagen large construct kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's specifications. no true type I FECV strain was adapted to cell cultures. a Bases in italics are part of the CMV promoter. b Bases in italics are part of the CMV promoter. pBeloBAC11 vector was digested with SfiI and SacII. a multiple-cloning site containing SfiI, NarI, BstBI, ClaI, BamHI, XhoI, AsiSI, and SacII recognition sites was inserted into the vector. two fragments containing the hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme, the whole N gene, ORF7ab, and a fragment containing the S, ORF3abc, E, M, and partial N genes of the DF-2 genome was amplified using primers IIIF and IIIR. it was cleaved with AsiSI and AvrII, and cloned into pBFIPV-I-II-III. the fragment containing the 3\u2032 end of ORF1ab and the whole S gene was amplified. shaded boxes represent the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 accessory sequences of the vector. the entire ORF3 region of CCoV Elmo/02 was amplified with primers ELMO5F and ELMO3R. FCWF-4 cells were grown to 70% confluence in 25-cm2 tissue culture flasks and transfected with 10 g of pBFIPV-DF-2 DNA. the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 72 h and were checked for the development of cytopathic effect (CPE) the parameters of the thermoprofile were 50\u00b0C for 30 min, 94\u00b0C for 15 min, 45 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30s, 54\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 7 min. all reactions were run in a Corbett Research Rotor-Gene real-time amplification system (RG-6000; Corbett Research, Mortlake, Australia) RT-PCR targeting the transcription of sg mRNAs in the ORF3abc region was performed using the Qiagen OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) the reaction mix contained 1 Qiagen OneStep RT-PCR buffer, 0.4 mM dNTPs, 600 nM forward (DF2F) and reverse (ORF3CR) primers. fetal bovine serum supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.2 mM glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, 0.25 g/ml amphotericin B, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 1% nonessential amino acids. blood mononuclear cells from 5 ml anticoagulated blood were purified on histopaque-1077 (Sigma- supernatant was collected after low-speed centrifugation (3,000 g for 10 min) titers were calculated as 50% tissue culture infectious doses (TCID50)/ml with the Reed and Muench method. cDNA was extracted from virus stocks using the QIAamp viral RNA minikit. maximum-efficiency DH10B competent Escherichia coli cells were transformed by heat shock according to manufacturer's instructions. for large-scale DNA preparation, the BAC vector and recombinant BACs were isolated with the Qiagen large construct kit (Qiagen) V genome to construct full-length clone pBFIPV-DF-2 Primer code Nucleotide positionc (5\u20323) Nucleotide positionc (5\u2032) 5\u2032DF2Fa GAGCTCGTTTAAAGTAAAGTGAG 1 5\u2032 SfiIR CTCACTTTTAAAAGTACGGTTCACTAAACGAGCTC 19 5\u2032DF2R GGCACAATGGTACTCCTCCTCT 763 IVF- CTCCTTACCCTACCA b Bases in italics are part of the HDV RZ sequence. c Primer positions correspond to the sequence of FIPV DF-2. pBeloBAC11 vector was digested with SfiI and SacII. a fragment containing the S, ORF3abc, E, M, and partial N genes of the DF-2 genome was amplified using primers IIIF and IIIR. three fragments covering the 3\u2032 half of ORF1ab were amplified with primers VF, VR, VIF, VIR, VIIF, and VIIR, digested with BstBI, ClaI, BamHI, and XhoI, and cloned into pBFIPV-DF-2 clone was digested with AsiSI and SacII. the fragment was cloned into pBFIPV-DF-2 to obtain pBFIPV-DF-2-R3i. FCWF-4 cells were grown to 70% confluence in 25-cm2 tissue culture flasks and transfected with 10 g of pBFIPV-DF-2 DNA. the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 72 h and were checked for the development of cytopathic effect (CPE) the parameters of the thermoprofile were 50\u00b0C for 30 min, 94\u00b0C for 15 min, 45 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30s, 54\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 7 min. all reactions were run in a Corbett Research Rotor-Gene real-time amplification system (RG-6000; Corbett Research, Mortlake, Australia) RT-PCR targeting the transcription of sg mRNAs in the ORF3abc region was performed using the Qiagen OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) the reaction mix contained 1 Qiagen OneStep RT-PCR buffer, 0.4 mM dNTPs, 600 nM forward (DF2F) and reverse (ORF3CR) primers. the genome showed 99% nucleotide homology to FIPVWSU-79/1146 (15), except in the ORF3abc region. the end of the type II CCoV sequence was found at nt 25641. recombination sites of FIPV DF-2 are shaded by different tones of gray. regions where the recombination most likely could have taken place are shaded black. the region showed 92% identity to the genome of the CCoV reference strain Elmo/02. PV transition, ORF7a (nt 27820 to 28125) and ORF7b (nt 28130 to 28750) were intact. Schematic representation of region 3 of CCoV Elmo/02 and DF-2 (B) strains. numbering starts at first nucleotide of regions' first core sequence. the gp7b protein of the vaccine strain terminated after the 45th aa. the intact 206-aa-long protein was present in the parent virus. topology predictions were executed on the full nsp6 proteins. the cDNA was flanked by a 24-bp poly(A) tail followed by the HDV ribozyme to release the full-length genome from the transcribed RNA with a correct 3\u2032 end. the clone was fully stable during its propagation in E. coli DH10B cells through several passages as indicated by EcoRI digestion. to recover infectious FIPV from the full-length cDNA, FCWF-4 cells were transfected with plasm the recombinant virus showed growth characteristics similar to and reached the same 4 106-PFU/ml titer as its wild-type counterpart at 24 h p.i. the final pBFIPV-DF-2-R3i recombinant construct contained the complete ORF3abc region from CCoV Elmo/02 but no other undesired mutations. the recombinant virus rescued after the transfection of FCWF-4 cells revealed somewhat slower growth characteristics compared to those of the parent virus. mRNA is transcribed, all of the 3a, 3b, and 3c genes are transcribed in PBFIPV-DF-2-R3i-infected cells. RT-PCR detection of sg mRNA transcription of ORF3abc of PBFIPV-DF-2 and PBFIPV-DF-2-R3i 24 h after infection of CrFK cells (MOI of 0.1) recombinant pBFIPV-DF-2 replication was detectable at 6 h p.i., increased rapidly by 12 h p.i. and then peaked at a 0.4 104- to 2 104-PFU/ml intracellular titer at 24 h p.i. the extracellular virus titers showed similar patterns with slightly lower titers. in feline monocytes, pBFIPV-DF-2 reached 2.1 105 to 1.2 106/ml cellular copy numbers. pBFIPV-DF-2-R3i gave only 5.3 103 to 2.5 104/ml. data from the TaqMan assay targeting the replicative RNA of the recombinant viruses gave similar results. the end of the type II CCoV sequence was found at nt 25641, 20 nt downstream of the start codon of the E gene. recombination may have occurred at the donor site between nt 13339 and 13343 and at the acceptor site between nt 25631 and 25641. bc region showed 92% identity to the genome of the CCoV reference strain Elmo/02. at the protein level the similarity was even higher, 93 and 95% in the case of the 3a and 3c proteins. however, there is a very significant difference between the ORF3abc regions of FIPV-DF-2 and CCoV Elmo/02. numbering starts at the first nucleotide of the regions' first core sequence. numbering starts at the first nucleotide of the regions' first core sequence. the dashed connector line represents the deleted part in the DF-2 genome. topology predictions executed by TMpred and HMMTOP programs on the full nsp6 proteins. only the sites of interest are shown (I, inside loop; o, outside loop; H, transmembrane helix). full-length clone revealed a 1-nt change at position 24429 (G/A) that resulted in an amino acid change in the S protein position 1332 (V/I) and a 1-nt silent mutation at position 26064 (T/C) in the M gene. the infectious cDNA clone was fully stable during its propagation in E. coli DH10B cells through several passages. the growth kinetics of the recombinant viruses PBFIPV-DF-2 and PBFIPV-DF-2-R3i after the infection of feline monocytes originating from five different cats (MOI = 5) the titers are given as the means from triplicate experiments (log10 TCID50/ml); error bars represent standard deviations. the recombinant virus rescued after the transfection of FCWF-4 cells revealed slower growth characteristics compared to those of the parent virus. in CrFK cells the ORF3abc-complemented virus grew to titers similar to those of the ORF3abc-truncated PBFIPV-DF-2. the DF2F forward primer was designed to hybridize to the leader sequence of the FIPV DF-2 genome. the ORF3CR reverse primer annealed to a sequence stretch of ORF3c present in both viruses. Lane 1, amplification of the ORF3abc sg RNAs of PBFIPV-DF-2 resulting in three amplicons. replication of recombinant pBFIPV-DF-2-R3i was detectable at 6 h p.i. but peaked at approximately 2 log10 lower values, 3 101 to 5 102 PFU/ml at 12 h p.i. the extracellular virus titers showed similar patterns with slightly lower titers. pBFIPV-DF-2-R3i gave only 5.3 103 to 2.5 104/ml. data from the TaqMan assay targeting the replicative RNA of the recombinant viruses gave similar results. large deletions characteristic of the ORF7b gene FIPV strains subjected to serial tissue culture passages led to increased fitness in vitro but caused the loss of virulence in vivo (20, 36) the presence of ORF3a and ORF3b is a distinctive feature for FCoV, CCoV, and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) the SARS-CoV 3a structural protein alters the intracellular trafficking of S, resulting in a decrease of its surface expression (45) it induces cell death, golgi fragmentation, the accumulation of intracellular vesicles (18), and cell apoptosis (47). the protein plays a role in attenuating interferon responses and innate immunity (34). in vitro growth kinetics of the ORF3abc truncated/intact virus pair PBFIPV-DF-2 and PBFIPV-DF-2-R3i were compared in cell lines and feline peripheral blood monocytes. a marked difference was found in blood monocytes, where PBFIPV-DF-2 replication revealed about 2 to 2.5 log10 higher virus titers than those of PBFIPV-DF-2-R3i. ex vivo infection experiments with an FIPV strain and a repaired ORF3abc seem to confirm the hypothesis that the truncated ORF3abc plays an important role in the acquisition of macrophage/monocyte tropism."}
