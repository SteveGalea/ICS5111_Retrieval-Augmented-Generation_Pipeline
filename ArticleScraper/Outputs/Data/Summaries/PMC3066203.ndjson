{"summary": "the lew/ztm-ci2 rat (ci = circling) arose as a spontaneous mutation in the inbred strain LEW/Ztm in 1991. the animals show spontaneous lateralized circling behavior, stargazing, locomotor hyperactivity, moderate ataxia and the inability to swim. the symptoms manifest during the first three weeks of life. mutations in myo15 cause the non-syndromic autosomal recessive profound hearing loss disorder (DFNB3). mutations in some of the other unconventional myosins, such as myosin VI and VIIa, have also been reported to be responsible for hereditary deafness in humans, mice and rats [10]\u2013[12], [13]. the lew/Ztm-ci2 rat is a valuable animal model for the human Usher syndrome. all animals originated from the CAF breeding colony. age of animals used for electrophysiological or histological investigations ranged between 400 and 750 days, with an average of 550 days. gene structure of myo15 and Kcnj12 was visualized using LIMSTILL, LIMS for Induced Mutations by Sequencing and TILLing. PCR was performed using a touchdown thermocycling program. PCR reactions contained 5 l genomic DNA, 0.2 M forward primer and 0.2 M reverse primer, 200 M of each dNTP, 25 mM Tricine, 7.0% Glycerol (w/v), 1.6% DMSO (w/v), 2 mM MgCl2, 85 mM Ammonium acetate pH 8.7 and 0.2 U Taq Polymerase in a total volume of 10 l. kription kit (Qiagen) was designed using the Oligo 6 program (Molecular Biology Insights); primer: Myo15-mRNA fw 5\u2032>ACCTGCCCAGTGTGCGTGAG3\u2032; primer: Myo15-mRNA rev 5\u2032>TGGTGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG3\u2032; primer: 10,5 l biotherm Buffer (with 15 mmol Mg a series of white single flashes were recorded with six increasing stimulus intensities reaching from 0.01 to 30.0 cds/m2. in a second step, rats were light adapted for 10 minutes with a background of 25 cd/m2. a-wave values were measured from the trough of the a-wave to the maximum positive value. microtomy was executed strictly perpendicular to the retinal surface. serial sections of 1\u20133 mm were stained with haematoxylin (Gill) and eosin. all animals originated from the CAF breeding colony. age of animals used for electrophysiological or histological investigations ranged between 400 and 750 days, with an average of 550 days. LIMSTILL, LIMS for Induced Mutations by Sequencing and TILLing (http://limstill.niob.knaw.nl) was used to generate the Myo15 project. PCR was performed using a touchdown thermocycling program. PCR reaction mixes contained 5 l genomic DNA, 0.2 M forward primer and 0.2 M reverse primer, 200 M of each dNTP, 25 mM Tricine, 7.0% Glycerol (w/v), 1.6% DMSO (w/v), 2 mM MgCl2, 85 mM Ammonium acetate pH 8.7 and 0.2 U Taq Polymerase in a total volume of 10 l. PCR products were diluted with 20 l water biotherm Buffer (with 15 mmol MgCl), 1,5 l of each primer (10 M), 0,5 l dNTP's (10 mM), 2 l SYBR\u00ae Green, 1 U Biotherm Taq in a total volume of 25 l. electroretinograms were recorded according to the standard of the International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision [25]. a series of white single flashes were recorded with six increasing stimulus intensities reaching from 0.01 to 30.0 cds/m2. in a second step, rats were light adapted for 10 minutes with a background of 25 cd/m2. microbiological monitoring was performed according to FELASA recommendations [23]. light intensity was measured in different locations in the room and in three different rack levels in front of the cages and inside the cages. illuminance meter (roline digital luxmeter) was used. mutation of the LEW/Ztm-ci2 rat was traced to a base substitution in exon 56 of Myo15. a genome-wide scan of a (LEW/Ztm-ci2BN/Ztm) backcross population demonstrated a strong association of the circling 2 phenotype with a region localized centrally in RNO10. two candidate genes, Myo15 and Kcnj12, were selected based on their genomic local expression of Myo15 transcripts To determine whether the base pair substitution affects Myo15 mRNA expression in general, a real time PCR of a Myo15 specific fragment was carried out. RNA was extracted from the pituitary gland of LEW/Ztm-ci2 and LEW/Ztm rats as the highest Myo15 RNA expression has been reported for this tissue [27]. the results indicate that there are no significant differences in Myo15 transcript levels in the pituit average skotopic a- and b-wave maximum amplitudes elicited by a 3 cds/m2 light stimulus. responses of ci2 mutants of the VetSchool group are strongly increased compared to controls. the incidence of the retinal phenotype was 100 percent. a complete loss of responses was observed in 36%. electroretinograms of LEW/Ztm control rats appeared normal. the remaining cell layers (inner nuclear layer, inner and outer plexiform layers) and the retinal pigment epithelium appeared intact. none of the LEW/Ztm-ci2 and LEW/Ztm rats of the MedSchool group showed any signs of photoreceptor degeneration. IPL = Inner Plexiform Layer, INL = Inner Nuclear Layer, OPL = Outer Plexiform Layer, ONL = Outer Nuclear Layer, PRC = Inner and Outer Segments of Photoreceptor Cells. the insert demonstrates the same retina with the sense-control. light exposure can cause severe retinal degeneration, particularly in albino rats. the environmental factors alone cannot be responsible for the retinal phenotype of LEW/Ztm-ci2 rats. microbiological monitoring did not reveal an infection with common rat pathogens except for Staph. aureus. rat was traced to a base substitution in exon 56 of Myo15. a genome-wide scan of a (LEW/Ztm-ci2BN/Ztm) backcross population showed a strong association of the circling 2 phenotype with a region localized centrally in RNO10. two candidate genes, Myo15 and Kcnj12, were selected based on their genomic localization and involvement in a similar pathology in human and mouse base substitution (TC) does not cause a stop codon but leads to an exchange of the amino acid Leucin for Proline at position 3157 in the Myosin XV protein. RNA was extracted from the pituitary gland of LEW/Ztm-ci2 and LEW/Ztm rats as the highest Myo15 RNA expression has been reported for this tissue. results indicate that there are no significant differences in Myo15 transcript levels in the pituitary glands skotopic a- and b-wave maximum amplitudes elicited by a stimulus with a light intensity of 3 cds/m2. all LEW/Ztm-ci2 rats showed decreased responses of the photoreceptor cells, both rods and cones. electroretinograms of LEW/Ztm-ci2 rats appeared normal. the rest cell layers (inner nuclear layer, inner and outer plexiform layers) and the retinal pigment epithelium appeared intact. none of the LEW/Ztm-ci2 and LEW/Ztm-ci2 rats of the MedSchool group showed any signs of photoreceptor degeneration. affected LEW/Ztm-ci2 rat showed slight reduction of photoreceptor cells due to age. a LEW/Ztm-ci2 rat indicates the presence of Myo15 mRNA in the retina. the insert demonstrates the same retina with the sense-control. mRNA was detected in retinas of LEW/Ztm rats. microbiological monitoring did not reveal an infection with common rat pathogens except for Staph. aureus, Pasteurella pneumotropica, Helicobacter sp., Corynebacterium sp., Rat Parvo Virus (MedSchool); and Oxyura syphacica muris (VetSchool). the mutation has been mapped to a region on rat chromosome 10, including strong candidate genes Myo15 and Kcnj12. Resequencing of these candidate genes revealed a base substitution (TC) in exon 56 of Myo15 causing an amino acid exchange in the C-terminal MyTH4 domain of myosin XV. a number of DFNB3 causing mutations have been identified. the PDZ domain of whirlin binds to the C-terminal MyTH4-FERM region of myosin XV [34], [35]. a homologous mutation in the whirlin gene (Whrn) in a mouse strain results in a phenotype very similar to that of the shaker-2 mice and circling-2 rats. myosin XV interacts with whirlin - a protein known to be involved in the usher syndrome (USH2D) whirlin plays a central role in the usher protein network, which consists of at least nine different proteins [41], [42] since myosin XV is responsible for the transportation of whirlin in the inner ear. a mouse model for Usher syndrome type 2A showed reduced ERG amplitudes and retinal degeneration solely in aged animals. none of the LEW/Ztm-Myo15ci2 animals showed any signs of impaired vision. a new genetic defect can be excluded since all animals were born in the same breeding colony in the same facility. a correlation between light intensity and severity of retinal degeneration was assumed as electroretinographical responses were slightly less in affected females than in males. a correlation between light intensity and severity of retinal degeneration was assumed as electroretinographical responses were slightly less in affected females than in males. the LEW/Ztm-Myo15ci2 rat exhibits characteristic features of the human Usher syndrome. this strain is an appropriate animal model for the investigation of the role of Myo15 in human Usher syndrome."}
