{"summary": "cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus) is a new world rodent species that has a long-standing history as an experimental animal model due to its unique susceptibility to human viruses. wild cotton rats are associated with a large variety of known or potentially zoonotic pathogens. cotton rat can serve as host-specific in vitro models for viral infection experiments. these cell lines may also serve as novel tools for virus isolation."}
