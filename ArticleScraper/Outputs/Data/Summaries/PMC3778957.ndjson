{"summary": "hearts from CD13KO knockout mice showed significant reductions in cardiac function, suggesting impaired healing in the absence of CD13. mechanistically, CD13KO infarcts showed an increase in small, endothelial-lined luminal structures, but no increase in perfusion, arguing against an angiogenic defect. monocytes differentiate into macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) the critical role of myeloid cells in post-MI healing is illustrated by studies in which systemic depletion led to markedly impaired wound healing and increased adverse cardiac remodelling. the role of CD13 as an inflammatory adhesion molecule in vivo is unclear. CD13 is up-regulated in the angiogenic vessels in the infarct area and border zone following MI. CD13 may mediate inflammatory cell adhesion following MI. Flow cytometry was performed on LSRII (Becton Dickinson) and analysed with FlowJo (Tree-Star) Western blot analysis Indicated regions of the infarcted heart were isolated 7 days post-MI. quantitative RT\u2013PCR for TGF- Different regions of the infarcted heart were isolated 7 days after MI and transforming growth factor- (TGF-) levels were quantitated (Supplementary material online). 2.12. Statistical analysis Results are presented as mean SEM. anti-CD45.1-PE, anti-F480-FITC, anti-Gr-1-APCe780, anti-CD3/CD19-NK1.1/Ly6G-AF700, anti-CD11c-PECy7, anti-CD11b-Pacific-blue, anti-CD115-APC, anti-Ly6C-PerCp-Cy5.5, and UV live/dead dye. CD13 expression is induced in the infarct border zone. expression peaked by 5\u20137 days and disappeared by 10 days after MI. expression increased by 15-fold at 7 days post-MI. RT\u2013PCR of transforming growth factor- (TGF-)-differentiated isolated cardiac fibroblasts untreated or 10 ng/mL of TGF-1, 24 h. CD13 is expressed on several cell types in the infarct area/border zone. sham echocardiographic measurements revealed no functional differences between genotypes. infarct sizes were also similar at 24 h and 7 days post-MI ruling out the effects of CD13 on acute myocyte death. however, at 7 days post-MI, the CD13KO mice showed a marked reduction in fractional shortening (FS) and ejection fraction. masson's trichrome staining of 5 m heart sections from the apex towards the base 7 days post-MI. infarct size was analysed by the measurement of the infarcted and non-infarcted endocardial and epicardial tissues. reductions in FS and ejection fraction were sustained 2 months post-MI in CD13KO mice. the process of healing following MI involves inflammation, angiogenesis, and tissue remodelling. adhesion molecules mediate the transmigration of functionally distinct subsets of monocytes through the blood vessels into the injured tissue. these cells are responsible for orchestrating subsequent wound healing27 by clearing the necrotic tissue. we observed a remarkable increase in cells displaying cytoplasmic mCherry expression in the infarct border zone. stability of infarct sections for apoptotic cell markers ruled out the possibility that the lower cell numbers were due to increased apoptosis in the absence of CD13. the lack of CD13 impairs inflammatory cell trafficking. lack of CD13 has no effect on cardiomyocyte function, but results in fewer SMA-positive myofibroblasts. lack of CD13 does not impair individual cardiomyocyte function in CD13KO mice. myofibroblasts at the infarct border zone were analysed 7 days post-MI. Error bars represent mean SEM for 26 cells from CD13WT and 25 from CD13KO mice. loss of CD13 results in increased but non-functional CD31-positive vessels in vivo. many of the lumens in the CD13KO hearts were quite small. these small vessels were apparently not perfused since CD13KO infarcted hearts excluded methylene blue dye to the same extent as WT infarcts. fluorescence quantitation indicated that there was no significant difference in the perfused green area between genotypes. CD13WT (n = 3) and CD13KO (n = 3) mice or (C) by injecting FITC-conjugated IB4-lectin to detect functional blood vessels. CD13KO (n = 3) mice or (C) by counterstaining fixed frozen tissues with Dylight 594-conjugated IB4-lectin to identify total blood vessels. RT\u2013PCR of transforming growth factor- (TGF-)-differentiated isolated cardiac fibroblasts untreated. CD13 is expressed on several cell types in the infarct area/border zone. CD13KO mice are essentially normal with respect to physiological myeloid cell functions. sham echocardiographic measurements revealed no functional differences between genotypes. infarct sizes were also similar at 24 h and 7 days post-MI ruling out effects of CD13 on acute myocyte death. acute infarct size was determined by TTC/Evan's blue staining 24 h post-MI; CD13WT (n = 4), CD13KO (n = 3). acute infarct size was determined by masson's trichrome staining of 5 m heart sections from the apex towards the base 7 days post-MI.

CD13WT (n = 3) and CD13KO (n = 3) mice or (C) by injecting FITC-conjugated IB4-lectin to detect functional blood vessels. primary lung endothelial cells isolated from CD13KO mice are unable to form capillary networks and form fewer branches. CD13KO mice have normal myeloid profiles, function, and differentiation. fewer total CD45+ haematopoietic cells in the infarcts of global CD13KO mice suggesting a generalized defect in inflammatory trafficking. fewer infiltrating monocytes would result in fewer macrophages and DCs and concomitant reductions in cytokines they elicit. reduced numbers of pro-inflammatory monocytes in phase I would in turn affect the recruitment of the reparative monocytes in phase II. the response to infarction phenocopies the decrease in cell numbers that we see in the CD13KO animals and results in significant reduction in heart function. the role of DCs in remodelling and the novel CD13-dependent mechanisms regulating their function in vivo are an exciting and unexplored field. the role of DCs in remodelling and the novel CD13-dependent mechanisms regulating their function in vivo are an exciting and unexplored field that is currently under study. phenotype was interpreted to be the result of impaired pericyte coverage leading to uncontrolled endothelial cell proliferation. despite similarities in individual myocyte contractility, CD13KO hearts are functionally impaired in both the short (7 days) and the short (7 days) after LAD ligation. this study confirms previous in vitro data and identifies CD13 as a novel and important immune adhesion molecule where optimal healing requires CD13 in vivo. the recently identified monocyte, macrophage, and DC subpopulations will certainly have to be selectively recruited to sites of injury to perform their specialized functions. however, identification of novel molecules directing this traffic may prove to be particularly valuable therapeutic targets. public health service grants CA-106345 from the National Cancer Institute.
