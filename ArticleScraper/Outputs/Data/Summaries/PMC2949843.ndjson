immunoblot analysis carried out to confirm cellular proteins' presence. five structural proteins, Beta actin, Tubulin, Annexin A2, S100 and Hsp27 were detected in purified PRRSV virions and protease-treated PRRSV virions. negative control of non-PRRSV infected Marc-145 cells lysates were purified using the same method as earlier for PRRSV virions. se overnight-digestion PRRSV virions followed by concentration through a sucrose cushion (lane 2) and purified Marc-145 cells lysate (lane 3) were analysed by Western blot. immuno-gold labling was performed for purified PRRSV virions. proteins present inside the virion are protected by lipid envelope. high purified PRRSV virions were immunogold labeled with antibodies against (A) Beta Actin, (B) Tubulin, (C) Annexin A2, (D) Hsp27, (E) S100 and (F) normal mouse IgG. labeled virus were then negatively stained by phosphotungstic acid. the PRRSV samples contained an abundance of virion particles without obvious contamination from host cellular material. three bright lanes (nucleocapsid protein N, membrane protein M and glycoprotein GP5) and three faint lanes (GP2a, GP3 and GP4) were found. virions were analyzed by 2-DE with 200 g of protein loaded on 18 cm gel strip (pI 3-10) three repeats of independent sample preparations and three repeats of independent 2-DE PAGE were performed under identical conditions. each gel provided high resolution spots for the separation of proteins. a total of sixty one host proteins were successfully identified and categorized into eight different groups. the proteins are mostly host

Theoretical molecular mass. h Sequence coverge is based on peptides with unique sequence. five structural proteins (GP2a, GP3, GP5, M and N) were identified in highly purified PRRSV virions. beta actin, tubulin, Annexin A2, S100 and Hsp27 were detected in purified virions and protease-treated virions. virions were incubated with antibodies of Beta Actin, Tubulin, Annexin A2, S100, Hsp27 and normal mouse IgG. virions are protected by lipid envelope and therefore will be present after protease treatment. virion-associated proteins were identified by using 2-DE/MS proteomics approach. a total of six viral proteins and sixty one host proteins were successfully identified. the relevance of cellular proteins to viral biology remains to be elucidated. actin was originally thought as a cellular contaminant, but later demonstrated to be an internal component of the measles virus. actin has been suggested to play a role in the transport of synthetic viral RNA, which is presumably a prerequisite for budding. beta-actin has been identified to interact with infectious bronchitis virus membrane protein and may play an important role in virion assembly and budding. cellular annexin A2 was found to be endogenously associated with HCMV, HIV, influenza virus particles, and herpes simplex virus 1. annexin A2 as a cellular cofactor interactes with phosphatidylserine that eventually promotes HIV entry into MDM. annexin A2 is bound to anionic phospholipids expressed on the virus surface. heat shock proteins may be involved in all phases of the viral life cycle. heat-shock response activation might be a specific virus function. stress proteins may also be important for virus replication. guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase, peroxiredoxin 1 and galectin-1 protein were first reported in PRRSV compared to other enveloped virus. guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase, peroxire -1, a dimeric beta-galactoside-binding protein, acts as a soluble adhesion molecule by facilitating attachment of HIV-1 to the cell surface. the protein facilitates HIV-1 infection by promoting early events of the virus replication cycle (i.e. adsorption) the virus pellet was resuspended in TNE buffer, layered on the top of 10-50% (w/v) CsCl gradients and concurrently centrifuged at 160,000 g (SW 40 rotor, Beckman) at 4\u00b0C for 4 h. the banded virus was collected, diluted with TNE buffer and then layered on the top of 25-65% (w/v) sucrose gradients. the highly purified PRRSV virions were lysed in lysis buffer (7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 2% Triton X-100, 100 mM DTT, 0.2% IPG buffer, pI 3-10) containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma) for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. after lysing by sonication for 5 min with 40% power output, the lysates were clarified by centrifugation the gels were stained by the modified silver staining method compatible with MS. image analysis was carried out with Image Master 2D Platinum 5.0. gels were rehydrated in a minimal volume of sequencing grade porcine trypsin. solution of -cyano-4-hydroxy-trans-cinnamic acid (CHCA) in 50% ACN containing 0.1% TFA. three bright bands were cut from one dimensional polyacrylamide gel. three bright bands were subjected to tryptic digestion. the visible proteins were cut from SDS-PAGE gel and subjected to tryptic digestion prior to mass spectrometric analysis. samples were desalted on RP trap columns (Zorbax 300 SB C18, Agilent Technologies), then separated on a RP column (150 m i.d., 100 mm length, Column technology Inc., Fremont, CA) the mass tolerance allowed for the precursor ions and fragment ions was 2.0 Da and 0.0 Da respectively. the protein identification criteria were based on delta CN (0.1) and cross-correlation scores (Xcorr, one charge1.9, two charges 2.2, three charges 3.75) the membrane was washed three times with TBS plus 0.2% Tween-20. the secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was added for 1 h at RT. the grids were then incubated on a drop of primary antibody solution for 1 h. the unbound antibodies were removed, and the grids were thoroughly washed and negatively stained with 3% phosphotungstic acid (pH 6.5) for 30 s. virions were examined on a scan and transmission electron microscope. purified virus was stored at -80\u00b0C for further use. lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 g for 20 min. IPG strips were rehydrated with 350 l of rehydration buffer (7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 2% CHAPS, 65 mM DTT, 0.5% IPG buffer pI 3-10 NL) containing 200 g protein for 12 h at 20\u00b0C with passive rehydration. gels were stained by modified silver staining method compatible with MS. the gels were rehydrated in a minimal volume of porcine trypsin (Promega, USA) solution (20 g/ml in 25 mM NH4HCO3) and incubated at 37\u00b0C overnight. the supernatant was collected and transferred into a 200 l microcentrifuge tube. the gels were extracted once with extraction buffer (67% ACN containing 5% trifluoroacetic acid TFA) a total of 133,518 sequences in the database actually were searched. a total of 133,518 sequences in the database actually were searched. a finigan TM LTQTM linear ion trap MS (Thermo Electron) was connected to the LC setup for eluted peptides detection. each scan cycle consisted of one full MS scan in profile mode followed by five MS/MS scans in centroid mode. each sample was analysed in triplicate. proteins by Western blot mouse monoclonal antibodies against Actin, Heat shock protein Hsp27 and S100 were purchased from Millipore. the negative control of non-viral infected MARC-145 cells lysate was prepared by using the same method as purifying PRRSV virions. grids were incubated with primary antibody goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with gold particles (6 nm in diameter, Abcam) for 1 h at RT. negatively stained virions were examined on a scan and transmission electron microscope. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors' contributions CZ performed the main proteomic experiments.
