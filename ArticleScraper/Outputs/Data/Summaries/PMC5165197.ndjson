{"summary": "as of 30 June 2016, there have been 1,769 confirmed MERS-CoV cases. as of 30 June 2016, there have been 630 confirmed cases, a case fatality rate of around 36%. a total of 27 countries have reported MERS-CoV cases. autopsy of fatal case of MERS-CoV infection has been recently published. authors did not find evidence of MERS-CoV replication in any extrapulmonary site, including the kidney or brain. a small-animal model for MERS-CoV is an important tool for studying the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV and to test and validate therapeutic strategies in vivo. a mouse model of SARS-CoV was developed by successful adaptation of SARS-CoV(Urbani) to mice by multiple passages (17) however, MERS-CoV is unable to replicate in the lungs of wild-type mice. hDPP4 is expressed in almost every organ of the body (23), which does not accurately reproduce the authentic tissue-specific distribution and level of expression of endogenously expressed mDPP4. however, significant brain pathology has not been observed in MERS-CoV infection in humans. a humanized mouse expressing hDPP4 in place of mDPP4 has detectable MERS-CoV replication with histological signs of MERS-CoV infection. this limited-duration study did not demonstrate significant clinical signs of MERS-CoV infection, e.g., weight loss (27) from 5 to 7 days postinfection, MERS-CoV-infected mice display significant signs of clinical disease. hDPP4 matched the tissue distribution and expression levels observed for endogenous mDPP4. hDPP4 expression in both hDPP4+/ and hDPP4+/+ mice is comparable to those of mDPP4 in hDPP4+/ or hDPP4+// mice in seven of the eight tissues assayed (P > 0.05) mDPP4 expression was detected on cells isolated from hDPP4/ mice. hDPP4 expression was detected on cells isolated from hDPP4/ mice. mDPP4 expression was detected on cells isolated from hDPP4/ mice. mDPP4+/ and hDPP4+/+ mice express both mDPP4 and hDPP4. hDPP4+/ mice do not have significantly different expression of hDPP4 compared to endogenous mDPP4. hDPP4 appears to be more highly expressed than mDPP4 in the kidney. mice infected with 2.5 103 PFU MERS-CoV(Jordan) lost 10% of their starting body weight by day 7 postinfection. they regained 5% of starting body weight by day 8 and remained at 100% of starting body weight for the remainder of the time course. mice showed no other visible signs of disease at any other time point. mice infected with 2.5 104 PFU MERS-CoV had all dropped below 80% of their starting body weight at 7 days postinfection. data in panel A represent means SEM of results for 5 to 30 mice. data in panels B to F are means SEM of results from 5 mice. mERS-CoV genomic RNA and mRNA levels were assayed by plaque assay on vero cells. mRNA primers report the presence of mRNAs that are found only when MERS-CoV is replicating in cells. at 2 days postinfection, significant levels of infectious MERS-CoV could be detected in mice infected with all 3 doses of MERS-CoV. 103 or 2.5 104 PFU MERS-CoV dropped 5- to 10-fold compared to levels at day 2 postinfection. levels of infectious MERS-CoV detected in lungs of mice infected with 2.5 102 PFU MERS-CoV remained at the levels observed at day 4 postinfection. at 7 days postinfection, there was no detectable MERS-CoV titer in the lungs of mice infected with the low or intermediate dose of MERS-Co mice infected with 2.5 102 or 2.5 103 PFU MERS-CoV were detected at days 14 or 21 postinfection. low levels of MERS-CoV M mRNA, 3 log lower than the day 7 time point, were detectable at days 14 and 21 postinfection. mice infected with all three doses of MERS-CoV had a productive MERS-CoV infection in the lungs. MERS-CoV RNA was detectable in blood and spleen. both genomic and M mRNA levels in these tissues were many orders of magnitude lower than the levels measured in the lung. these data suggest that MERS-CoV is present at a low level into the bloodstream of infected mice. infection with MERS-CoV results in significant lung pathology. images from lung sections of hDPP4 mice infected with 2.5 102 (A), 2.5 103 (B) or 2.5 104 (C) PFU of MERS-CoV(Jordan) showed various levels of lymphocytic perivascular inflammation, macrophage infiltration, pleuritis, and epithelial necrosis. pathology scores of lungs of mice infected with 2.5 103 PFU MERS-CoV per group were scored for pathological signs of disease on a scale of 0 to 5. scores were averaged and rounded to the nearest whole number: +, 0 or 1; ++, 2 or 3; +++, 4 or 5; dpi, days postinfection. MERS-CoV infection of hDPP4-expressing mice causes a dose-dependent inflammatory disease characterized by predominantly perivascular inflammation. compared to the lower doses tested, mice infected with 2.5 104 PFU MERS-CoV showed the most severe MERS-CoV infection phenotype. 1,900 genes with expression altered by at least 50% compared to mock-infected controls. by day 7 postinfection, 5,536 genes, or about one-quarter of the mouse genome, was perturbed. multiple cytokines and chemokines associated with both Th1 and Th2 responses were dramatically upregulated in infected lungs. cytokine group, Cxcl9, Cxcl11, Cxcl10, Ccl7, Ccl2; fibrosis group, Timp1, Mmp13, Serpine1, Col1a1; macrophage group, C1qa, C1qc; T-cell group, Cd8a, Cd3e, Cd3g; endothelial group, Robo4, Pecam1, Egfl7, Tie1 the second cluster shows a more gradual pattern, with expression increasing over the time course of infection or only at day 7. many genes in this category were associated with cell adhesion and wound-healing functions. those in this orange group were associated with more-established disease. B cell-associated genes are the only cluster whose members showed diminishing expression levels over the entire time course of MERS-CoV infection. the dendritic cell marker Fscn1 was modestly upregulated at days 4 and 7 postinfection, while NK cell markers (Itga2, Ncr1) were unchanged. the results confirm the shared biology underpinning the host response to coronavirus infection. hDPP4-expressing mice infected with 2.5 104 PFU MERS-CoV over time course of infection. flow cytometry used to identify subsets of lymphocytes (B cells, NK cells, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells) at 2 days postinfection, there is no significant difference in lung leukocyte populations in MERS-CoV-infected mice compared to mock-infected controls. peaks of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and macrophages can be observed over the time course of MERS-CoV lung infection. compared to mock-infected controls, significant peaks of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and macrophages can be observed over the time course. histology, flow cytometry, RNA-Seq, and cytokine and chemokine data suggest that MERS-CoV disease in mice ischaracterized by a large influx of T cells into the lungs of infected mice. however, as both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are present in higher numbers in MERS-CoV-infected mice, the relative contributions of each cell type to pathogenesis cannot be determined from these data. C57B6/hDPP4 mice were depleted of CD4+ T cells (A, B), CD8+ T cells (C, D), or macrophages (E, F) and monitored for weight loss (A, C, E) and MERS-CoV titer (B, D, F) data shown are means SD for samples, with each of the 5 mice per time point shown as individual dots. depleting CD8+ T cells exacerbated overall inflammation, bronchiolar inflammation, lymphocyte infiltration, and pleuritis at day 7 postinfection. despite mildly worse inflammation observed at day 7, depletion of CD8+ T cells significantly protected against MERS-CoV-dependent weight loss. 5 MERS-CoV-infected mice per group were scored for pathological signs of disease on a scale of 0 to 5. scores were averaged and rounded to the nearest whole number: +, 0 or 1; ++, 2 or 3; +++, 4 or 5; dpi, days postinfection. the data suggest that MERS-CoV disease induces infiltration of macrophages into the lungs of infected mice. depletion of macrophages from the lungs of hDPP4 mice caused significantly greater weight loss at days 6 and 7 postinfection than in controls. macrophages protect mice from MERS-CoV-dependent lung inflammation but do not promote or inhibit MERS-CoV replication in vivo. hDPP4 tissue and immune cell distribution is the same as endogenous mDPP4 tissue distribution in C57B6/hDPP4 mice. hDPP4 expression is not restricted to the lungs and also has a distinct tissue distribution. hDPP4 expression in hDPP4+/ and hDPP4+/+ mice was significantly higher than mDPP4 expression in hDPP4+/ or hDPP4+/ mice. we observed no significant difference in mDPP4 distribution in hDPP4+/ mice compared to hDPP4/ mice in all organs (P > 0.05) mDPP4+/ and hDPP4+/+ mice were stained for mDPP4 and hDPP4. cells were identified as CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, or macrophages. mDPP4 expression was detectable on cells isolated from hDPP4+/ mice. mice infected with 2.5 102, 2.5 103, or 2.5 104 PFU of MERS-CoV(Jordan) lost significant weight, resulting in a 20% weight loss by day 7 postinfection in all mice. mice infected with an intermediate dose of 2.5 103 PFU MERS-CoV(Jordan) lost 10% of their starting body weight by day 7 postinfection but regained 5% of starting body weight by day 8 and remained at 100% of starting body weight C57B6/hDPP4 mice were infected with 2.5 102, 2.5 103, or 2.5 104 PFU MERS-CoV(Jordan) and assessed for signs of disease and MERS-CoV replication. titers in the lung (B), MERS-CoV genomic RNA expression in the lung (C) and MERS-CoV M RNA expression in the lung (D) were assessed at 2, 4, 7, 14, and 21 days postinfection. MERS-CoV replicates efficiently in lungs of hDPP4-expressing mice. mice infected with 2.5 102, 2.5 103, or 2.5 104 PFU were productively infected with MERS-CoV. no mice in this group for analysis at days 14 and 21 postinfection. mice infected with 2.5 102 PFU MERS-CoV had a mean of 3.09 104 PFU/g MERS-CoV. mice infected with 2.5 103 PFU MERS-CoV had a mean of 1.25 105 PFU/g MERS-CoV. mice infected with 2.5 103 PFU MERS-CoV had a mean of 1.25 105 PFU/g MERS-CoV. high levels of MERS-CoV genomic RNA and M RNA were detected in all infected groups. we suspect both that the assay to detect RNA is more sensitive than plaque assay. the viral RNA may be stable longer in the lungs than live virus. PP4 under the endogenous mouse promoter displayed a disseminated pattern of MERS-CoV infection. we measured levels of MERS-CoV RNA in the blood, brain, liver, kidney, and spleen of mice intranasally infected with 2.5 104 PFU MERS-CoV(Jordan) mice had the highest levels of MERS-CoV replication in the lungs compared to mock-infected controls. infection with MERS-CoV results in significant lung pathology. lungs of mice expressing hDPP4 infected with MERS-CoV show significant interstitial inflammation with perivascular cuffing and extensive alveolar septal thickening. we did not observe any weight loss at day 4 postinfection. pathological signs of disease, including lymphocytic perivascular inflammation, were resolved by day 14 postinfection. in mice infected with 2.5 103 PFU MERS-CoV, no inflammatory resolution was observed by day 7 postinfection. in addition, there was evidence of moderate edema (Table 3). pathology scores of lungs of mice infected with 2.5 104 PFU MERS-CoV per group were scored for pathological signs of disease on a scale of 0 to 5. scores were averaged and rounded to the nearest whole number: +, 0 or 1; ++, 2 or 3; +++, 4 or 5; dpi, days postinfection. hDPP4-expressing mice cause a dose-dependent inflammatory disease characterized by predominantly perivascular inflammation mice infected with 2.5 104 PFU MERS-CoV display the most severe MERS-CoV infection phenotype. at day 2 postinfection, 2,484 genes were differentially regulated. by day 7 postinfection, 5,536 genes, or about one-quarter of the mouse genome, was perturbed. after infection with 2.5 104 PFU MERS-CoV(Jordan), C57B6/hDPP4 mouse lungs were harvested at 2, 4 and 7 days postinfection and profiled by RNA-Seq. each column represents a mouse sample, while each row represents 1 of 5,536 genes whose expression is significantly altered between day 7 postinfection mice and controls. unsupervised hierarchical clustering allowed for further classification of these gene changes. the set of genes perturbed at day 7 postinfection compared to mock-infected controls fell roughly into four categories. members of this group showed sharply elevated expression by day 2 postinfection. gamma interferon was 40-fold upregulated compared to mock-infected controls. the upregulated cytokines suggest T cell and macrophage recruitment upon infection with MERS-CoV. for example, both Cxcl11 and Cxcl10 are chemokines that promote T cell migration. to investigate further, we used a panel of genes showing cell-type-specific expression. hDPP4 mice infected with 2.5 104 PFU MERS-CoV are infiltrated with macrophages, neutrophils, and both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. at 2 days postinfection, there is no significant difference in lung leukocyte populations in MERS-CoV-infected mice compared to mock-infected controls. both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell numbers increased 4-fold at day 7 postinfection compared to mock-infected controls. numbers of B cells, NK cells, DCs, basophils, and eosinophils in the lungs were not significantly affected by MERS-CoV infection at any time point compared to mock-infected controls. influx of macrophages, neutrophils, and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells infected mice. cells infiltrate after day 4 postinfection and reach very high levels. macrophages infiltrate lungs of infected mice from day 4 postinfection. 4+ T cell depletion on the MERS-CoV-dependent weight loss (P > 0.05) or on the MERS-CoV titer in the lungs of infected mice at day 4 or 7 postinfection (P > 0.05) these data suggest that CD4+ T cells do not contribute to MERS-CoV replication, persistence, or pathogenesis in vivo. C57B6/hDPP4 mice were depleted of CD4+ T cells (A, B), CD8+ T cells (C, D), or macrophages (E, F) and infected with 2.5 104 PFU MERS-CoV (Jordan) and monitored for weight loss (A, C, E) and MERS-CoV titer (B, D, F) no significant changes in lung pathology were observed at day 4 postinfection. pathology scores of mice depleted of CD8+ T cells and infected with 2.5 104 PFU MERS-CoV. depletion of macrophages causes enhanced MERS-CoV-induced weight loss and pathology but does not alter MERS-CoV replication or control. depletion of macrophages resulted in no significant changes in pathology at 4 days postinfection compared to treatment with control liposomes. however, depletion of macrophages did appear to make MERS-CoV-induced overall inflammation, perivascular inflammation, edema, eosinophilia, and lymphocyte infiltration worse at day 7 postinfection. DISCUSSION MERS-CoV is an emerging highly pathogenic coronavirus for which there are no approved treatments or vaccination strategies. a well-characterized small-animal model that reproduces the disease seen in humans is required for early-stage testing of putative therapies in vivo. hDPP4 expression by organ and immune cell type was equivalent to endogenous mDPP4 expression. infection of hDPP4-expressing mice with different doses of MERS-CoV yields three different disease phenotypes. all infected mice were clear, or almost clear, of infectious MERS-CoV in the lungs by day 7 postinfection. studies have shown that MERS-CoV is capable of spreading to other organs in infected mice when DPP4 is expressed under a strong ubiquitous promoter (23, 25) the recent human case report suggests that MERS-CoV does not spread to any other organ during human infection. othelial marker gene expression in our RNA-Seq data is consistent with the vascular damage observed in the human autopsy study. a significant transcriptional upregulation of T cell chemokines, such as Cxcl10 and Ccl12, of factors produced by macrophages, such as Ccl3 and Ccl4. the role of macrophages and monocytes in human disease is unknown due to the lack of human samples. we found that CD4+ T cells have no effect on MERS-CoV-induced pathology, replication, or persistence in the lungs of infected mice. we found that depletion of CD8+ T cells have no effect on MERS-CoV-induced pathology, replication, or persistence in the lungs of infected mice. macrophages produce a cytokine/chemokine that protects the lung from excessive inflammation. previous work on the SARS-CoV demonstrated that macrophages in the lungs of mice were detrimental to lung pathology and clearance of SARS-CoV by inhibiting efficient T cell responses. the inoculum used in this study was one that caused high levels of infection, lung pathology, and clinical disease. the depletion experiments do not result in a total lack of either T cell-type in the lungs, in contrast to the complete knockout mouse experiments in the study by Zhao et al. all experiments with live MERS-CoV were performed under biosafety level 3 conditions at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. mice that were heterozygous for hDPP4 were bred by crossing hDPP4 homozygotes with mDPP4 homozygotes. PCR products were run on a 1% agarose gel and assigned as wild type for mDPP4 expression (hDPP4/) or heterozygote (hDPP4+/) or homozygote (hDPP4+/+) for hDPP4 expression based on band migration. eight- to 12-week-old C57/B6 mice were euthanized using isoflurane. mice were intranasally inoculated with PBS or 2.5 102 PFU, 2.5 103 PFU, or 2.5 104 PFU of MERS-CoV(Jordan) diluted into PBS for a total volume of 50 l per mouse. mice were weighed on the day of infection and every day of the experiment to assess MERS-CoV-induced weight loss. RNA was extracted using the Direct-zol RNA miniprep kit (Zymo Research) according to the manufacturer's instructions. levels of MERS-CoV genomic RNA and M mRNA were determined using the Fast 1-step PCR mix (Life Technologies) the overall inflammation score is based on bronchiolar inflammation, perivascular inflammation, and interstitial inflammatory response. scores were then averaged, rounded to the nearest whole number, and assigned a rating as low/none. levels of expression of inflammatory cytokines and receptors were assessed using the mouse inflammatory cytokines and receptors RT2 profiler PCR array. BD Biosciences), CD8 (clone number 53-6.7; BD Pharmingen), CD11c (clone number M1/70; BioLegend), CD19 (clone number 6D5; BioLegend), CD45R (b220; clone number RA3-6B2; BioLegend), CD49b (clone number RA3-6B2; BioLegend), F4/80 (clone number BM8; dendritic cells (DCs; CD11c+ MHCII+), macrophages (CD11b+ F4/80+ MHC-II+), basophils (FcRI+ CD200R3+), eosinophils (F4/80+ CD193+), or neutrophils (CD11b+ Ly6G+) were stained for DPP4 using antibodies to mDPP4 (clone number 155202; R&D Systems mice were inoculated with 2.5 104 PFU of MERS-CoV(Jordan) or PBS. mice were intranasally inoculated with 50 l of PBS or clodronate-containing liposomes. we achieved a specific 90% reduction in splenic CD4+ or CD8+ T cells. PCR was performed on an Illumina HiSeq2000 instrument by a multiplexed, single-read run with 33 cycles. reads were decoded based on their barcodes. read quality was evaluated using Fastqc. human DPP4 (hDPP4)-expressing C57B6/hDPP4 mice were bred at the University of Maryland School of Medicine by crossing hDPP4 homozygotes with mDPP4 homozygotes. eight- to 12-week-old C57/B6 mice were genotyped using the extract-N-Amp Tissue PCR kit. PCR for both mDPP4 and hDPP4 was performed using a common forward primer (CTGGCTTAGATCTCTGGCGT), an mDPP4 reverse primer (ATTGGCACGGTGATGATGGTG) PCR products were run on a 1% agarose gel and assigned as wild type for mDPP4 expression (hDPP4/) or heterozygote (hDPP4+/+) for hDPP4 expression based on band eight- to 12-week-old mice heterozygote for hDPP4 (hDPP4+/) were used in all MERS-CoV infection experiments. mice were intranasally inoculated with PBS or 2.5 102 PFU, 2.5 103 PFU, or 2.5 104 PFU of MERS-CoV(Jordan) diluted into PBS for a total volume of 50 l per mouse. RNA was extracted using the Direct-zol RNA miniprep kit (Zymo Research) according to the manufacturer's instructions. levels of MERS-CoV genomic RNA and M mRNA were determined using the Fast 1-step PCR mix (Life Technologies) the overall inflammation score is based on bronchiolar inflammation, perivascular inflammation, edema, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, pleuritis, and epithelial necrosis. scores were then averaged, rounded to the nearest whole number, and assigned a rating as low/none (0 or 1; indicated as +), medium (2 or 3; ++), or high (4 or 5; +++). cells were stained with antibodies to CD3 (clone number 145-2C11; BioLegend), CD4 (clone number GK1.1; BD Biosciences), CD8 (clone number 53-6.7; BD Pharmingen), CD11b (clone number M1/70; BioLegend), CD19 (clone number 6D5; BioLegend), F4/80 (clone number BM8; BioLegend), and analyzed on individual cell populations were identified as B cells (CD3 CD19+ B220+), natural killer (NK) cells (CD3 CD49b+ NK1.1+), T cells (CD3+ CD4+ for T helper cells or CD3+ CD8+ for cytotoxic T cells), dendritic cells (DCs; CD11c+ MHCII+), macrophages (CD11b+ F4/80+ MHC-II+), basophils (FcRI+ mice were infected with 2.5 104 PFU MERS-CoV(Jordan) and monitored for weight loss. lungs were harvested at days 2, 4, or 7 postinfection. total RNA was purified using the MagMAX-96 for Microarrays Total RNA Isolation kit. raw sequence data (BCL files) were converted to Fastq format via Illumina Casava 1.8.2. read quality was evaluated using Fastqc (www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) a Bonferroni posttest was obtained when P values were 0.05."}
