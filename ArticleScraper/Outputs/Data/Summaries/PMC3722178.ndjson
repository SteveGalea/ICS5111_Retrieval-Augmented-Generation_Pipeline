{"summary": "primary human respiratory epithelial cell cultures provide the ideal in vitro systems for investigation of cell factors required for growth of respiratory human viruses. the alveolar epithelium consists of both alveolar type I cells (ATI), which make up 95% of the surface area of the lung, are terminally differentiated, non-dividing, and function in gas exchange and fluid homeostasis. in 2005 the fifth human coronavirus, HCoV-HKU1, was discovered by RT-PCR HCoV-HKU1 can infect and be serially propagated in primary human alveolar type II cells but not in alveolar type I-like cells or alveolar macrophages at the air-liquid interface. the isolation of cells was conducted as previously described with exception that the type II cells were not suitable for transplant. cells were allowed to adhere to inserts for 2 days submerged in DMEM with 10% FBS. then cultured at an air-liquid interface in DMEM with 1% charcoal-stripped serum (CS-FBS) for 2 days. alveolar macrophages and alveolar type I-like cells were cultured and characterized. cells were grown under air/liquid conditions, inoculated with HCoV-HKU1. cells were stained for DAPI (A), HCoV-HKU1 (B), TTF-1 (C), and merged (H) cells were inoculated with primary clinical isolates of HCoV-HKU1 or isolates of HCoV-HKU1 which had been passaged one time on primary, differentiated, human bronchial-tracheal epithelial cells (P1 virus) after 4 hour incubation, the inoculum was removed and cells were incubated at 34oC. immunostained cells were imaged using a Zeiss Axioskop 2 fluorescent microscope with Axiovision software and a Zeiss LSM 700 laser scanning confocal microscope with Zen software. Viral RNA from pooled apical washes was extracted using a bioRobot EZ1 extractor (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. RT-PCR was performed using 50\u00b0C for 15 minutes, 95\u00b0C for 2 minutes, and 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 seconds, 60\u00b0C for 30 seconds. cells were harvested for RNA analysis using the RNeasy RNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), cDNA synthesis using qScript cDNA SuperMix. real-time PCR analysis was performed on bio-Rad CFX96 instrument. gene expression values were normalized to show expression relative to the cyclophilin B, a housekeeping gene. alveolar macrophages and alveolar type I-like cells were plated on rat tail collagen\u2013coated dishes at a density of 0.5\u20131.0105/cm2 in DMEM with 10% FBS (15. after 24\u201348 h the medium was changed to 5% FBS without additives. phenotype was documented by staining for receptor for advanced glycation end products. cells were grown under air/liquid conditions, inoculated with HCoV-HKU1. panels A-D show staining for DAPI (A), HCoV-HKU1 (B), TTF-1 (C) and merged (D) panels I-L show staining for DAPI (M), HCoV-HKU1 (J), proSP-B (K), and merged (L) patients were inoculated with primary clinical isolates of HCoV-HKU1 or isolates of HCoV-HKU1 which had been passaged one time on primary, differentiated, human bronchial-tracheal epithelial cells. after 4 hour incubation, the inoculum was removed and cells were incubated at 34oC. immunostained cells were imaged using a Zeiss Axioskop 2 fluorescent microscope with Axiovision software and a Zeiss LSM 700 laser scanning confocal microscope with Zen software. Viral RNA from pooled apical washes was extracted using Qiagen EZ1 Virus Mini Kits (Valencia, CA) following manufacturer\u2019s instructions. RT-PCR was performed using the following cycling conditions. 50\u00b0C for 15 minutes, 95\u00b0C for 2 minutes, and 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 seconds, 60\u00b0C for 30 seconds. cells were harvested for RNA analysis using RNeasy RNA extraction kit. real-time PCR analysis was performed using the following cycling conditions: 50\u00b0C for 2 minutes, 95\u00b0C for 10 minutes, and 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 seconds and 60\u00b0C for 1 minute. ethics statement The committee for the protection of human subjects at national Jewish health has deemed use of human lung donor cells as nonhuman subject research. genotype HKU1/DEN/2010/10 1/6/2010 21 yr F heart transplant fever, chest pain, cough, tachypnea DVT+viral URTI A HKU1/DEN/2010/12 1/9/2010 2 yo M CHD increased O2 requirement hypoxemia A HKU1/DEN/2010/18 1/22/2010 2 yo M CHD increased O2 requirement hypoxemia A HKU1/DEN/2010/18 1/22/2010 2 yo M CHD increased O2 cells were inoculated with media alone or a 110 dilution of the clinical isolate HKU1/DEN/2010/21 at 34oC, maintained at the air-liquid interface, and fixed 96 hours post infection. Neither the type 1-like cells nor alveolar macrophages were susceptible to infection. type II cell cultures were immunolabeled with rabbit antibodies to purified HCoV-HKU1 spike protein and fluorescein labeled anti rabbit IgG (green) ATII cells had a morphological appearance of a cobblestone epithelial monolayer, typical for type II cells. apical surfaces were washed 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 hrs post inoculation. viral genome copies increased approximately 1000 fold during the course of the infection indicating productive infection and replication. viral genome copy numbers were maintained over the course of three passages. IFA with antibodies to HCoV-HKU1 spike glycoprotein performed at 120 hours confirmed the presence of infected cells at the end of each passage. mRNA from HCoV-HKU1 and control cells was analyzed at 72 hours post inoculation. gene expression values were normalized to expression of the cyclophilin B (CYB), a housekeeping gene. Error bars represent the standard deviation between donors (A) or replicates (B). human alveolar type I-like cells, alveolar type II cells, and alveolar macrophages were tested. cultures were inoculated with primary clinical isolates of HCoV-HKU1 or passage 1 (P1) virus. cell cultures were immunolabeled with polyclonal rabbit antibodies to purified HCoV-HKU1 spike protein and fluorescein labeled anti rabbit IgG. panels A and B show mock and HCoV-HKU1 infection of alveolar type II cells, respectively. alveolar type II cells supported infection with HCoV-HKU1. ATII cells had a morphological appearance of a cobblestone epithelial monolayer. they were fluorescently labeled with antibodies to surfactant protein A (SP-A), pro-surfactant protein B (proSP-B), thyroid transcription factor\u20131 (TTF-1) and a type II specific transmembrane protein (Hu-280) cultures were inoculated with a primary clinical isolate of HCoV-HKU1. data represent RT-PCR of apical washes from HCoV-HKU1 infected cells harvested at the indicated time points postinoculation. alveolar type II cells at the air-liquid interface were highly susceptible to HCoV-HKU1 infection. at 72 hours post inoculation, HCoV-HKU1 infection induced markedly increased levels of mRNAs encoding type III interferons. levels of relative cellular gene expression varied significantly between human donors tested. first study to demonstrate infection of primary human alveolar type II cells at the AL/I with primary clinical specimens containing HCoV-HKU1 RNA. alveolar macrophages and type I-like cells were not susceptible to HCoV-HKU1. this supports our hypothesis that primary human alveolar cells can be a suitable culture system for isolation and propagation of novel human respiratory viruses that cause lower respiratory tract disease. study highlights importance of ATII cells in pathogenesis of viral induced lower respiratory tract disease. coronavirus 229E can readily infect human alveolar macrophages, but not type I-like or type II alveolar cells. HCoV-229E is a common cause of upper respiratory tract infection. induction of syncytia formation by HCoV-HKU1 most likely indicates direct cell to cell spread of virus. this ability confers multiple potential pathogenic advantages over cell free spread. fusion with cell membranes of target cells is an essential first step in infection for all coronaviruses. a class 1 viral fusion protein that is a major determinant of cell and host specificity may occur through different mechanisms. the innate immune system serves as the first line of defense in protection of the host against viral infections. the characteristics of the initial immune response can greatly impact the resultant clinical outcome. type II cells infected with HCoV-HKU1 demonstrated syncytia formation. HCoV-HKU1 has strong tropism for type II alveolar cells. this suggests a potential mechanism for evasion of host immune surveillance."}
