{"summary": "swabs or sputum specimens were obtained from patients suspected of having pertussis on the day of hospitalization. the specimens were tested with the filmArray Respiratory Panel, a multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay that detects 16 viruses, Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae) and Chlamydophila pneumoniae (C. pneumoniae) pertussis remains one of the top ten fatal infections in children (4). typical clinical symptoms include repeated paroxysmal cough, an inspiratory whoop and post-cough vomiting (5). a resurgence of pertussis in the post-vaccination era has been reported in developed countries despite high vaccination coverage. the standard laboratory diagnostic criteria for the identification of B. pertussis include culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays and serodiagnosis (13-15) the culture of nasopharyngeal secretions is currently the gold standard for pertussis diagnosis. however, given the harsh growth conditions, the detection rate of culture remains low. Respiratory Panel (FilmArray RP, v1.7) is able to detect 16 viral and 3 atypical respiratory pathogens, including B. pertussis, in a single test. the multiplexed nature of this test enables the rapid differentiation of B. pertussis from other viruses that also cause pertussis-like syndrome. the positive rate of B. pertussis detected by filmArray RP is 6.3% (49/775) in the whole setting and 35% (49/140) in pertussis suspected patients. a total of 851 patients with RTIs were screened in a previous study. Specimens Nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) or sputum specimens were obtained from patients with suspected pertussis on the day of hospitalization at SCMC from December 01, 2016 to November 30, 2017. Demographic information (i.e., age at enrollment and gender), medical history including vaccination history for pertussis as well as information of clinical symptoms and treatments received were documented for each enrolled patient. the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and the a total of 851 patients with RTIs were screened in a previous study. among 775 eligible patients, 140 were suspected of having pertussis. the symptomatology was confirmed at least by two physicians from the department of Respiratory Medicine and the department of Infectious Diseases. enza virus types 1 to 4 (Para 1\u20134), coronaviruses 229E, HKU1, OC43, and NL63 (Cov-HKU1, NL63, 229E, OC43), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), RSV, Rhino/Entero, Chlamydophila pneumoniae (C. pneumoniae), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae) and B. pertussis. onset 3 months 77 (55.0) 27 (55.1) 50 (54.9) 4 months\u20139 years 62 (44.3) 21 (42.9) 41 (45.1) 10 years 1 (0.7) 1 (2.0) 0 Gender Male 80 (57.14) 23 (46.9) 57 (62.6) Female 60 (42.86) 26 (53.1) 34 (37.4) Underlying diseases None 96 (68.6) 41 (83.7) 55 (60.4) CHD 40 (28.6) 7 (14.3) 33 (36.3) Con the overall positivity rate of the specimens was 95.0% (133/140) B. pertussis was the most prevalent pathogen (35.0%, 49/140) followed by Rhino/Entero (32.9%, 46/140) and RSV (31.4%, 44/140). pathogen and multiple pathogens in 49 children with pertussis-like syndrome most commonly detected in these samples. the detection rates of the samples with single positive samples, multiple positive samples and no pathogen in 91 children with pertussis-like syndrome. clinical feature Pertussis, N=49 (%) Pertussis-like, N=91 (%) Statistics P value Age 6 months 42 (85.7) 63 (69.0) 4.615 0.032 Inspiratory whoop 7 (14.3) 7 (7.7) 1.538 0.215 Cyanosis 15 (30.6) 33 (36.3) 0.452 0.502 Apnea 3 (6.1) 8 (8.8) 0.313a 0.747 Complications Liver damage 9 (18. tested positive for pertussis, 14 (28.6%) patients were positive for only pertussis. 34 (69.4%) patients were co-detected with at least one virus. 1 patient was co-detected with pertussis and M. pneumoniae. whoop 4 (28.6) 3 (8.8) 3.105a 0.171 Cyanosis 5 (35.7) 10 (29.4) 0.183 0.669 Apnea 1 (7.1) 2 (5.9) 0.027a 1.000 CHD 3 (21.4) 4 (11.8) 0.743a 0.400 Complications 2 (14.3) 11 (32.4) 1.639a 0.292 Need of oxygen 4 (28.6) 8 (23.5) 0.134a 0.726 SMZ-TMP whoop 4 (28.6) 0 2.794a 0.254 Cyanosis 5 (35.7) 3 (37.5) 0.007a 1.000 Apnea 1 (7.1) 1 (12.5) 0.177a 1.000 CHD 3 (21.4) 1 (12.5) 0.273a 1.000 Complications 2 (14.3) 4 (50.0) 3.274a 0.137 Time of hospitalization (d) 10 (5.5, 12.5)b 9.5 (8, 14.75)b 0.652b 0.5 hospitalization time for this group was significantly longer than that of those without respiratory support (14 vs. 6 d, respectively) the initial WBC counts of these two groups were comparable, but the lymphocyte ratio was lower in the patients with or without respiratory support. 49 patients with pertussis were treated with azithromycin or erythromycin together with symptomatic treatment. one patient died of hyperleukocytosis combined with pulmonary hypertension and multiple organ failure. RP analysis, and the other 65.0% (91/140) of patients were diagnosed with pertussis-like syndrome. the general characteristics of the enrolled patients, such as the contact history and vaccination status, are presented in Table 1. Flow diagram showing the design of the present study. the two patients in the pertussis-like group died of neuroblastoma and hyperleukocytosis. two of the three patients in the pertussis-like group died of congenital heart disease and one of congenital intestinal malrotation. Rhino/Entero, RSV or Rhino/Entero + Para3 most common. up to four different pathogens were detected in a single sample. more pertussis patients than pertussis-like syndrome. the median number of white blood cells (WBCs) in the pertussis group was 18.40 (13.05, 23.69)109/L. the patients with pertussis were more likely to be co-infected with virus than the patients with pertussis-like syndrome (2=22.509, P0.01). data lacking a normal distribution are expressed as the median and quartiles, i.e., median (25%, 75%), and the statistic is Z value. clinical characteristics of patients with only pertussis and with pertussis/virus co-infections were evaluated. clinical feature Single BP, N=14 (%) Mixed BP/viruses, N=34 (%) Statistics P value Uncompleted Immunization 14 (100.0) 27 (79.4) 0.374a 0.090 Gender, male 7 (50.0) 16 (47.1) 0.034 0.853 Fever 4 (28.6) 6 (17.6) 0.718a 0.448 Wheeze 4 (28.6) 16 (47.1) 1.394a 0.338 Inspiratory whoop 4 (28 clinical feature Single BP, N=14, (%) Mixed BP/RSV, N=8, (%) Statistics P value Uncompleted Immunization 14 (100.0) 7 (87.5) 1.833a 0.364 Fever 4 (28.6) 8 (100.0) 10.476a 0.002 Wheeze 4 (28.6) 6 (75.0) 4.426a 0.074 Inspiratory whoop 4 (28.6) 0 2.794a 0.254 Cyanosis 5 (35.7) clinical characteristics of the 49-pertussis positive patients with or without respiratory support. patients born prematurely tended to require oxygen intake more frequently than other patients. the hospitalization time for this group was significantly longer than those without respiratory support. 57 contact history 12 (33.3) 7 (53.8) 1.693a 0.193 SMZ-TMP 4 (11.1) 3 (23.1) 1.117a 0.363 Time of hospitalization (d) 6 (5, 10)b 14 (8, 17)b 3.084b 0.002 WBC (109/L) 17.49 (12.98, 22.42)b 19.76 (13.65, 24.47)b 0.906b 0.365 LY% 70.15 (62.95, 75 more patients were diagnosed with pertussis than with pertussis-like syndrome at less than 6 months of age. more patients in the pertussis/RSV group than in the pertussis-only group required respiratory support. the median WBC count in patients less than 3 months old was only 17.33109/L. in china, routine vaccination against pertussis with DTwP was introduced in the early 1960s, when 3 doses of DTwP were given at 3, 4 and 5 months of age. the DTaP vaccine is much safer than the DTwP vaccine, but the immunization duration of the former is only 5\u20136 years. the 2015 WHO recommendation suggested administering the DTaP vaccine to children >7 years of age, adolescents and pregnant women. the use of macrolide antibiotics in the catarrhal stage can reduce or even prevent coughing. the use of macrolide antibiotics in the catarrhal stage can reduce or even prevent coughing. four cases with WBC counts >50109/L underwent exchange transfusion. all 7 patients were clinically improved and discharged. this suggests early diagnosis and macrolide treatment play important roles in the treatment and prognosis of pertussis. previous studies have shown that pertussis infection in children sometimes mimics viral RTIs. at present, most of the PCR-based assays target the insertion sequence (IS481) for B. pertussis detection (51-54) IS481 is internally repeated >50 times in each B. pertussis genome. the genetic target for B. pertussis in the FilmArray RP is the promoter region of the PT gene. the present study describes the current status of B. pertussis infection in china. it highlights the need for timely and accurate diagnosis based on both clinical symptoms and laboratory methods."}
