{"summary": "targeted breeding has been common practice since the 18th century. in livestock, targeted breeding has been common practice since the British Agricultural Revolution of the 18th century. gene editing offers new opportunities to livestock breeding for disease resistance. cloning of edited fibroblasts or direct injection of the zygotes with editor reagents allows researchers to introduce editor reagents into cultured cells typically by lipofection, electroporation, or microinjection. this allows researchers to discover functions associated with novel genes. cloning is performed in fibroblast cells, which are cultivated in vitro. the fibroblast cell is fused with an enucleated oocyte shell in a process called somatic cell nuclear transfer. cloning is generally inefficient with hundreds of reconstituted zygotes being transferred to a single recipient. editing of sperm by lipofection or electroporation can generate heterozygous offspring following artificial insemination. pigs have been edited to remove a gene required for male fertility, generating an empty spermatagonial stem cell niche in the testis. ovo electroporation of editing reagents allowed the analysis of gene function in the neural crest. however, it is unlikely that this approach could be efficiently utilized to generate edited birds. advances in chicken stem cell technology show the greatest promise for genome editing in chicken. the resulting offspring generated from breeding with the founders will be a mixture of edited or nonedited. the resulting offspring generated from breeding with the founders will be a mixture of edited or nonedited. genome-edited pigs lacking CD169 were not resistant to PRRSV infection. pigs lacking CD169 consists of nine globular domains, organized like beads on a string, with domain 5 determined to mediate the key-lock interaction allowing viral entry into pig cells. aminopeptidase N is important for peptide digestion in the small intestine. knockout mice were shown to have delayed mammary gland development. further investigation into potential consequences of absence aminopeptidase N in pigs warranted. a comparison of the warthog and domestic pig genomes identified differences in the Rel-like domain-containing protein A (RELA, also known as p65) protein was thought to underlie the different responses of the related species to ASFV infection. no edited chickens have been produced to date. disease resistance to avian influenza is at the top of the wish list. pigs can act as an intermediate host-aiding virus adaptation to humans. selective breeding has generated highly productive, robust animals. selective breeding for disease resistance has proven difficult, as outbreaks are often sporadic and resistant/resilient animals often difficult to identify. selection for the favorable fucosyl transferase 1 allele has been integrated into many pig-breeding programs. crossbreeding is not possible in cases where resistance or resilience is observed in a related species. crossbreeding could bridge these gaps. one example of this is resilience of wild suids to africa swine fever virus. genetic resistance to disease may be present in a small percentage of production animals. genetic selection for these animals may be associated with risk of inbreeding, productivity loss, or the risk of losing other desirable traits. genetic resistance to disease may be present in an indigenous or less productive breed. macrophage-specific proteins, CD163 and CD169, were identified as receptors for the virus. CD169 acting on the surface of the cells and CD163 inside the internalizing transport vesicles. genome-edited pigs lacking CD169 were not resistant to PRRSV infection. in vitro host\u2013pathogen studies identified aminopeptidase N as the receptor for TGEV and a potential receptor for PEDV. in humans, aminopeptidase N defects are associated with different types of leukemia and lymphoma. infected wild suids are thought to act as a reservoir of the virus in africa. a cytokine storm, i.e., an overreaction of the immune system, is observed. researchers used genome editing to convert a key region of the encoded domestic pig protein sequence to the warthog equivalent. PRRSV infects cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage and two macrophage-specific proteins, CD163 and CD169. the virus was thought to attach to CD169 to be taken up into the cells. genome-edited pigs lacking CD169 were not resistant to PRRSV infection. coronaviruses porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) both cause severe diarrhea in preweaned piglets. aminopeptidase N is the receptor for TGEV and a potential receptor for PEDV. virus poses a huge risk to the pig industry worldwide and is a limiting factor to a sustainable pig industry in many parts of africa. the virus also infects wild suids, such as warthogs and bushpigs without causing overt disease. chicken Avian leucosis virus is divided into six subgroups. the avian leucosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) is responsible for major disease outbreaks in china. despite cells showing resistance to avian influenza, no edited chickens have been produced. gene editing approaches focus on targeting host genes involved in mediating entry of the virus, with a special focus on receptors. host genes play an important role in other steps of the pathogen replication cycle and also provide editing targets for disease resilience or resistance. an alternative antipathogen approach pursued for decades is the generation of transgenic livestock expressing antiviral or antibacterial agents. the acidic leucine-rich nuclear phosphoprotein-32A (ANP32A) plays a key role in avian influenza virus replication in both chicken and water fowl. however, deletion of a small region of chicken ANP32A can prevent replication of avian influenza virus. however, such approaches offer exciting opportunities that have the potential to benefit both industry and animal welfare. selective breeding has generated highly productive, robust animals. selective breeding for disease resistance has proven difficult, as outbreaks are often sporadic and resistant/resilient animals often difficult to identify. a good example of this is pigs with resistance to enterotoxigenic E. coli. crossbreeding is not possible in cases where resistance or resilience is observed in a related species. genetic comparison can be used to identify the functional differences underlying such traits, and genome editing employed to introduce appropriate variants into domestic pigs. genetic resistance to disease may be present in a small percentage of production animals. genetic selection for these animals may be associated with risk of inbreeding. crossbreeding would result in productivity loss and risk of losing other desirable traits. the rapid expansion of the field of genome editors over the last 7 yr has made practicable genome modifications which had previously been unattainable. the rapid expansion of the field of genome editors over the last 7 yr has made practicable genome modifications which had previously been unattainable."}
