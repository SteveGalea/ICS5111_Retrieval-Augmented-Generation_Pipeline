{"summary": "quantitative, semi-quantitative or quantitative approaches can be used, but most take significant time to develop. quantitative measures for risk prioritisation include the calculation of epidemiological parameters such as disease incidence, prevalence, mortality and morbidity rates, costs of prevention, treatment or control. additional measures for animals include losses to production. the H-index method can be obtained in the same way for both human and animal pathogens. it can be obtained in the same way for both human and animal pathogens. it could be a step forward in separating high and low priority diseases or pathogens. previous work has shown that the H-index is a proxy for human disease impact. we investigated its value as a proxy for human disease impact [6],(McIntyre, unpublished) pathogen occurring in at least one host of interest to the study (including humans and European domestic animals; see Table 1). further information about each organism, such as their taxonomic division for pathogens (bacteria \u2013 including rickettsia, fungi \u2013 including algal pathogens, helminths, protozoa, and viruses \u2013 including prion agents) is stored using a series of statements. iel Capra hircus Domestic goat Oryctolagus cuniculus Roe deer Ovis aries musimon Mouflon Cervus elaphus Red deer Pavo cristatus Blue peafowl Chinchilla lanigera Chinchilla Phasianus colchicus Ring-necked pheasant Columba livia Domestic pigeon Rangifer tarandus Reindeer Cri H-index literature search protocol Information sources H-index searches were undertaken in January 2012 using Web of Science (WoS). previous work established that results of H-index searches for pathogens undertaken using different bibliographic sources are not identical but are highly correlated. the list was split according to host-pathogen interaction information. high impact pathogens had the highest H-indices. zoonotic pathogens appeared in both lists. es Aspergillus niger, Z, NE 110 Fungi Hepatitis C Virus, NZ, E, GBD, EC 289 Viruses Burkholderia cepacia, NZ, NE 107 Bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Z, E, A 271 Bacteria Clostridium botulinum, Z, E, A, EC 106 Bacteria Human Herpesvirus 4, N coccus pneumoniae, Z, E, GBD, EC 199 Bacteria Leishmania donovani, Z, E, A, GBD 98 Protozoa Candida albicans, Z, E, A 181 Fungi Bacteroides fragilis, Z, NE, A 97 Bacteria Human Herpesvirus 1, NZ, E 171 Viruses Gibberella moniliformis, NZ, E 97 Fungi Respiratory enterica serovar enteritidis, Z, E, A, GBD, EC 87 Bacteria Influenza A Virus, Z, E, A, GBD, EC 135 Viruses Treponema pallidum, NZ, E, GBD, EC 133 Bacteria Trichomonas vaginalis, Z, E, A 132 Bacteria Hepatitis E Virus, Z, E, GBD 83 Viruse E 81 Viruses Neisseria meningitidis, NZ, E, GBD, EC 130 Bacteria Proteus mirabilis, Z, NE, A 80 Bacteria Chlamydia trachomatis, Z, E, GBD, EC 129 Bacteria Shigella dysenteriae, Z, E, GBD, EC 80 Bacteria Clostridium difficile, Z, E, A 126 Fungi pathogens include those which are zoonotic (Z), non-zoonotic (NZ), emerging (E) and not emerging (NE) in this work. the major pathogens causing diseases included in the 2012 Global Burden of Disease report are noted. eria Brucella abortus, Z, E, H, DISC 246 Bacteria Enterobacter aerogenes, Z, NE, H, DISC 75 Bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Z, E, H, DISC 75 Bacteria Listeria monocytogenes, Z, E, H, DISC 74 Bacteria Haemonchus contortus, NZ, NE, 143 Bacteria Reticuloendotheliosis Virus, NZ, NE, NS, DISC 68 Viruses Influenza A Virus, Z, E, H, OIE 135 Viruses Coxiella burnetii, Z, E, H, OIE 67 Bacteria Mycobacterium bovis, Z, E, H, OIE 132 Bacteria Mannheimia haemolytica, Z, DISC 106 Bacteria Parainfluenza Virus 5, Z, NE, NS 65 Viruses Pasteurella multocida, Z, NE, NS, OIE 65 Bacteria Encephalomyocarditis Virus, Z, NE, NS, DISC 105 Viruses Porcine circovirus, NZ, E, NS, DISC 65 Viruses Yersinia pestis, Z, philum, Z, E, NS, OIE 62 Viruses West Nile Virus, Z, E, H, OIE 96 Viruses Streptococcus agalactiae, Z, E, NS 62 Bacteria Bovine Papillomavirus, NZ, E, NS, DISC 95 Viruses Echinococcus granulosus, Z, E, NS, NS, DISC 87 Bacteria Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus, NZ, NE, NS, DISC 84 Viruses Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, NZ, NE, NS, DISC 59 Bacteria Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus 1, NZ, E, NS, NS 80 Viruses Feline Calicivirus, Z, E, NS 80 Viruses DISC 77 Bacteria Trichostrongylus colubriformis, Z, NE, NS, DISC 57 Helminths Pathogens also included in the list of top 100 human pathogens are noted (H) the major pathogens causing diseases included in the OIE list of notifiable terrestrial and aquatic animal diseases are noted [10], as are those included in the DISCONTOOLS project (DISC) [11]. all analyses were undertaken using the statistical software package R [22] with statistical significance determined by a P-value of less than 0.05. an EID2 background has been described previously [7]; here, we used similar criteria to define pathogens. pathogens, helminths or their taxonomic rank are stored using a series of statements. previously, we examined characteristics of pathogen species [7]. here, we include sub-species, to account for important strains e.g. Escherichia coli O157H7. zoonotic pathogens were classified as those naturally transmitted between vertebrate (non-human) animals and humans (as the definitive host), not including species which have recently evolved from animal pathogens. emerging pathogens are those that have appeared in a host population for the first time (including newly-evolved strains) results of H-index searches for pathogens undertaken using different bibliographic sources (e.g. WoS, SCOPUS, Google Scholar) are not identical but are highly correlated. english is used in WoS, however searches also include foreign-language publication title translations. all literature in the WoS database has been published. all literature in the WoS database has been published. Virus searches included pathogen scientific name, alternative names, synonyms and alternative spellings according to NCBI Taxonomy [19], [20], and the term \u2018virus\u2019. examining pathogens listed under each disease's details in the NCBI MeSH library [14]. specific lists of diseases had been provided in other work [9], [11]. information on pathogenic status of each pathogen was verified using manual literature searches of the scientific literature.

H-indices for human-only, zoonotic, and animal-only pathogens were examined using a two-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with log10-transformation of the response, including emerging status as an explanatory covariate. post-hoc Tukey multiple comparison of treatments were undertaken using the HSD.test [21] of the top 100 human pathogens, 66 were classed as zoonotic and 67 were emerging, compared to 67 and 57 for domestic animal pathogens. reasons for failure to include pathogens may be that pathogenic agents cause rarely diagnosed disease, or because disease agents are diverse. among the top 100 domestic animal pathogens described, 76 were notifiable according to the OIE [10], or included in DISCONTOOLS [11], or both. 76 of the top 100 domestic animal pathogens described were either notifiable according to the OIE [10], or included in DISCONTOOLS [11]. fungi and helminths are particularly under-represented in GBD assessments. there was no difference between taxonomic divisions in the percentage reportable to the EC (FET, P = 0.109) human pathogens classed as emerging were statistically more likely to have GBD estimates. animal pathogens classed as zoonotic were (of borderline statistical significance) less likely to be included in the OIE list (Pearson's 2, P = 0.055, effect size() = 0.22, OR = 0.39) there was no difference in the percentage included in DISCONTOOLS. no other correlations were significant. results of Spearman's Rank correlations between H-indices and DISCONTOOLS prioritisation of major animal diseases. priority lists of human and domestic animal pathogens present in Europe were short-listed. of the top 100 human pathogens, 66 were classed as zoonotic and 67 were emerging. 42 were either included in the GBD [8], or are reportable to the EC [9], or both. causes for failure to include pathogens may be that pathogenic agents cause rarely diagnosed disease. among the top 100 domestic animal pathogens described, 76 were notifiable according to the OIE [10], or included in DISCONTOOLS [11], or both. causes of specific disease being diverse, for respiratory infection - Feline Calicivirus, and GI symptoms - Campylobacter fetus. fungi and helminths are particularly under-represented in GBD assessments. there was no difference between taxonomic divisions in the percentage reportable to the EC (FET, P = 0.109). human pathogens classed as emerging were statistically more likely to have GBD estimates. classed as zoonotic (compared to non-zoonotic) were less likely to be included in the OIE list (Pearson's 2, P = 0.055, effect size() = 0.22, OR = 0.39) there was no difference in the percentage included in DISCONTOOLS. no other correlations were significant. results of Spearman's Rank correlations between H-indices and DISCONTOOLS prioritisation of major animal diseases. estimates of public (human) health (zoonotic and animal pathogens) and impact on wider society (animal-only pathogens) no other correlations were significant. results of Spearman's Rank correlations between H-indices and DISCONTOOLS prioritisation of major animal diseases. the study establishes priority lists of human and domestic animal pathogens present in Europe using the H-index as a proxy measure for impact. previous work suggests that higher H-indices indicate higher impact for a pathogen relative to lower H-indices [6], (McIntyre, unpublished material) the H-index method has both strengths and weaknesses. H-indices are likely to underestimate the contribution of scientific literature published in non-English languages. the literature searching method also doesn't account for the quality of publications in which pathogen names appear. the literature searching method also doesn't account for the quality of publications in which pathogen names appear and the typical number of citations within different fields. the effect of emerging status is unsurprising, given this focus in surveillance work and despite a lag in time-to-publication leading to their likely under-representation in H-index calculations. for some animal pathogens, this is the first time that emerging status has been examined. if animal-only diseases were included, there was a significant positive relationship with impact on wider society. this suggests a human-centric bias in H-indices; for example, a pathogen causing little impact in animals may nevertheless have a high H-index if zoonotic. priority lists should be used by agencies and research organisations."}
