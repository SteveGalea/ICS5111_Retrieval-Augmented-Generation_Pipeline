{"summary": "211 rectal swabs were collected from calves aged 0\u20136 months. all samples were collected in sterile tubes containing 10 ml of 1/100 antibiotic 10 mM phosphate-buffered saline. RNA was extracted from 300 l of the supernatant obtained from each rectal swab using the RNAiso PLUS kit. some of the RT-PCR-positive samples were sequenced and primarily analyzed by comparison of nucleotide sequences using the online Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) the 3\u2032-end of ORF2 and the ORF1b/ORF2 regions were confirmed by subgenomic RNA analysis. 5\u2032-ATCATACAGGCGGGCACGAGT-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CCCTTCACCTATGCTAATCAAATC-3\u2032 were used to amplify the ORF1b/ORF2 region. the final reaction volume of 25 l consisted of 2.5 l of 10x L.A Taq Polymerase buffer, 4.0 l of dNTP mixture, 0.25 l of LA Taq Polymerase (Takara Bio, Inc.), 0.5 PCR products of expected sizes were purified and then cloned into pMD18-T plasmid vectors (Takara Bio, Inc.) the recombinant plasmids were submitted in duplicate for DNA sequencing to Invitrogen Biotech (Beijing, China) the recombinant plasmids were then cloned into pMD18-T plasmid vectors. 92 (43.6%) were positive for bovine astrovirus (cattle: 46.10%, 71/154; water buffalo: 36.84%, 21/57). astroviruses are widely distributed among cattle and water buffalo populations in Guangxi province, china. 4 (12.5%) of 32 samples were only positive for BAstV and negative for all other gastrointestinal viruses tested in this study. the co-infection status was as follows: BEV, 53.1% (17/32); BAstV, 46.9% (15/32); BVDV, 18.7% (6/32); BCoV, 15.6% (5/32); and BToV, 0% (0/32). cloned 18 partial nucleotide sequences of 1,200\u20131,426 bp in length in most 3\u2032-ends of ORF2. seven fragments of approximately 3,000 bp in length partially covering ORF1b and the full length of ORF2 were successfully amplified. five of six isolates from water buffalo (BufAstGX M52, BufAstGX M53, BufAstGX M54, BufAstGX M541 and BufAstGX M552) clustered together appeared to form a new independent subgroup. one water buffalo isolate (BufAstGX 141) formed a new subgroup and appeared to be very closely related to the CcAstV-1/DN phylogenetic trees were constructed based on seven predicted full-length ORF2 sequences. each genotype was represented at least by one or more prototype strains. each genotype was represented at least by one or more prototype strains. the most 3\u2032-end of ORF2 of bovine-related astroviruses was highly conserved by 42 nt. the most 3\u2032-end of ORF2 of the bovine-related astroviruses was highly conserved by 42 nt. bovine astrovirus was detected by RT-PCR from rectal swabs collected from young calves of cattle and water buffalo with diarrhea. but more studies are needed to determine whether the persistent diarrhea observed in these calves was mainly associated with the high prevalence of astroviruses. similar results were reported in china, where co-infection of bovine astrovirus with gastrointestinal viruses, other than BRV and BToV, was associated with clinical symptoms of diarrhea in 20- and 14-day-old calves [14] all isolates in this study were closely related to BAstV-B76-2/HK, BAstV-B18/HK, CcAstV-1/DNK/2010 and CcAstV-2/DNK/2010. astrovirus isolates from cattle and water buffalo isolated in this study showed relatively close relationships, indicating that these animals were infected with diverse astroviruses. however, evidence exists of possible cross-infection between the two hosts; therefore, control measures against bovine astrovirus should also be taken into consideration. 58.4 58.6 58.4 58.3 58.5 59.6 BufAstGX M52* BufAstGX M53* *** 99.3 98.6 98.8 57.8 57.5 57.4 58 58.2 58.9 58.1 59.5 BufAstGX M53* BufAstGX M54* *** 99.3 56.8 62.3 62.2 57 X J22 BAstGX J8 *** 99.7 99.9 75.6 BAstGX J7 BAstGX J7 *** 99.6 75.3 BAstGX J7 BAstGX J27 5 BAstGX G1 *water buffalo. a sequence motif upstream of ORF2 was predicted to be the signal of the putative promoter for subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) synthesis in bovine astrovirus study is among the largest epidemiological investigations of bovine astrovirus conducted at the farm level in the dairy industry in china."}
