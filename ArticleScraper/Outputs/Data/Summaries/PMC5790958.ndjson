{"summary": "AIDS, caused by infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), emerged in the 20th century as one of the worst infectious diseases (10, 11) only two SIVcpzPtt viruses have successfully invaded the human population: HIV-1 group M (for \u201cmajor\u201d or \u201cmain\u201d; HIV-1M) and group N (for \u201cnew\u201d or \u201cnon-M\u201d). fewer than 20 patients have been reported as infected with HIV-1N. cellular antiviral proteins play pivotal roles as species-specific barriers to cross-species viral transmission. a series of restriction factors have been identified in primate lentivirus infections. a bone marrow/liver/thymus (BLT)\u2013humanized-mouse model (33) is partially capable of replicating in human tissue cultures. the process by which SIVcpzPtt evolved to become HIV-1 in humans remains unclear. we have established an in vivo model of human hematopoietic stem cell-transplanted humanized mice (34\u201337) we included four strains of HIV-1M (strains NL4-3, NLCSFV3, JRCSF, and AD8), two strains of HIV-1N (strains YBF30 and DJO0131), and three strains of SIVcpzPtt (strains MB897, EK505 and MT145) the infectivity of MB897 was lowest among the SIVcpzPtt strains. the amino acid sequences of nine viral proteins were concatenated and aligned as described in Materials and Methods. the tree was constructed using the maximum-likelihood method. humanized mice were inoculated with the virus preparations. then the viral RNA (vRNA) in the plasma and the number of human CD4+ T cells (determined as CD45+ CD3+ CD4+ cells) in the peripheral blood (PB) were longitudinally monitored until 15 weeks postinfection (wpi) the amount of vRNA in the plasma (A) and the level of peripheral human CD4+ T cells (CD45+ CD3+ CD4+ cells) (B) were analyzed at 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, and 15 wpi. each average with SEM is shown as a dot with an error bar. the numbers of human CD4+ T cells in the spleens of mice infected with HIV-1M JRCSF (n = 5), HIV-1M AD8 (n = 6), HIV-1N YBF30 (n = 6), HIV-1N DJO0131 (n = 10), SIVcpzPtt MB897 (n = 8), and SIVcpzPtt EK505 (n = 9) were analyzed by flow cytometry. a significant proportion of virus-producing (i.e., Gag-positive) cells were found in the spleens of infected mice at 15 wpi. the proportions did not differ depending on the type of virus used for inoculation. the level of acute vRNA of SIVcpzPtt MB897 was comparable to those of HIV-1N strains. correlation between acute vRNA and CD4+ T cell decrease. the minimum CD4+ T cell decrease by 15 wpi (y axes) and acute vRNA level (x axes) (x axes) are shown. the lines represent exponential approximation. the Vif proteins of SIVcpzPtt strains used in this study were efficiently capable of counteracting human APOBEC3F and APOBEC3G. these results suggest that no mutations are required for SIVcpzPtt Vif to degrade antiviral human APOBEC3 proteins in vivo. the data represent averages with SDs. the input of cell lysate was standardized to -tubulin. the input of cell lysate was standardized to -tubulin. the gp120 G413R mutation was found in all three mice analyzed. the infectivity of the virus containing the gp120 G413R mutation was significantly (approximately 3.9-fold) higher than the parental virus. m30R substitution in viral MA has been reported to increase replication kinetics of SIVcpzPtt in ex vivo human tonsil histoculture. we have previously demonstrated that HIV-1M Vpu augments viral dissemination in our humanized-mouse model. VSVg-pseudotyped HIV-1M and SIVcpzPtt solutions were inoculated into MT-4 cells at an MOI of 0.1. forty-eight hours postinfection, levels of surface CD4 and tetherin on Gag-positive cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. ivity of each virus was determined using the TZM-bl cell assay. the value of parental MB897 was set to 100 to facilitate comparison. this assay was performed in triplicate, and averages with SDs are shown. the MA M30R and gp120 G413R derivatives replicated more efficiently than the parental virus. the cumulative amount of viral Gag in the culture supernatants was significantly higher than that of the parental virus. this suggests that these two mutations positively contribute to viral fitness in the culture of PHA-activated human PBMCs in vitro. the chromatograms of the sequences of input virus and vRNA in the plasma of 5 infected mice at 6 wpi are shown. the chromatograms of the direct sequence of the regions of MA (top), Vpu (middle) and gp120 (bottom) are represented, and the percentage of each sequence is indicated under the chromatogram. parental MB897 was inoculated into humanized mice. vRNA in the plasma was analyzed at 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 9 wpi. each average with SEM is shown as a dot with an error bar. glycine is highly conserved in HIV-1/SIVcpz in the C4 region of gp120. the mutation significantly increased the infectivity of MB897, but the infectivity of the other viruses was significantly decreased by this G-to-R mutation. this mutation is beneficial only for SIVcpzPtt MB897. a preparation of HIV-1N YBF30 was prepared by expanding the virus in a culture of phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) the supernatant, containing virus, was collected for use in subsequent experiments. TZM-bl indicator cells were used to measure viral infectivity. one microgram of each IMC, except for YBF30, was transfected into HEK293T cells. the viral RNA (vRNA) in the plasma and the number of human CD4+ T cells in the peripheral blood were longitudinally monitored until 15 weeks postinfection (wpi) virus supernatants containing 5 ng of p24 antigen were inoculated into humanized mice. the amount of vRNA in the plasma (A) and the level of peripheral human CD4+ T cells (CD45+ CD3+ CD4+ cells) (B) were analyzed at 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, and 15 wpi. the levels of virus-infected cells (i.e., Gag-positive cells) in the spleens of mice infected with HIV-1M JRCSF (n = 5), HIV-1M AD8 (n = 5), HIV-1N YBF30 (n = 4), HIV-1N DJO0131 (n = 7), HIV-1N DJO0131 (n = 6), HIV-1N DJO0131 (n = 10), HIV-1N DJO0131 (n = mice infected with each of the four HIV-1M strains, two HIV-1N strains, or SIVcpzPtt MB897 had similar maximum vRNA levels. the maximum vRNA level in SIVcpzPtt EK505-infected mice was significantly lower than those of HIV-1M- and SIVcpzPtt MB897-infected mice at 15 wpi. acute vRNA and minimum CD4+ T cell numbers in PB were significantly correlated using this method (Fig. 3A and C) these data indicate that the replication capacity and pathogenicity of SIVcpzPtt MB897 are more similar to those of HIV-1M strains than those of the other SIVcpzPtt strains tested. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (rs) was adopted to determine a statistically significant correlation between each value. some mutations were detected in all SIVcpzPtt-infected mice. some nonsynonymous mutations were detected in the regions encoding Vif. mutation g7032a (gp120 G413R) is indicated by a red asterisk. activity of SIVcpzPtt Vif to counteract human APOBEC3 proteins. expression plasmids for pNL4-3vif and either APOBEC3F or APOBEC3G expression plasmids were cotransfected. gram of the IMCs of SIVcpzPtt MB897 and its derivative (MB897 gp120 G413R) was individually transfected into HEK293T cells. the amount of viral particles was quantified by p24 ELISA. the infectivity of each virus was determined with a TZM-bl cell assay. the infectivity of the virus containing the gp120 G413R mutation was significantly (approximately 3.9-fold) higher than that of the parental virus. the substitution in viral MA has been reported to increase replication kinetics of SIVcpzPtt in ex vivo human tonsil histoculture. the MB897 NLvpuTM mutant potently downregulated human tetherin from the surfaces of infected cells. a microgram of the IMCs of MB897 and MB897 NLvpuTM (pMB897 NLvpuTM) was individually transfected into HeLa cells. the amount of viral particles in the culture supernatant was quantified by p24 ELISA. the value of parental MB897 was set to 100 to facilitate comparison. the value of parental MB897 was set to 100. the infectivities of the MA M30R and gp120 G413R strains were 1.4-fold and 3.7-fold higher than that of the parental strain, MB897. the infectivity of MB897 NLvpuTM was 0.42-fold lower. the cumulative amount of viral Gag in the culture supernatants of the MA M30R and gp120 G413R strains was significantly higher than that of the parental virus. in vivo competition assay, 4 types of virus preparations containing 1.25 ng of p24 antigen each were coinoculated into humanized mice. after 6 weeks, the infected mice were euthanized and the vRNA in plasma was sequenced. chromatograms of the sequences of input virus and vRNA in the plasma of 5 infected mice are shown. we inoculated the virus into eight humanized mice at the same amount as parental MB897. the plasma vRNA of MB897 3mut was significantly higher than that of parental MB897 after 5 wpi. these findings suggest that these three mutations beneficially contribute to the efficacy of viral replication in vivo. the value of parental virus was set to 100 to facilitate comparison. asterisks indicate statistically significant differences from parental MB897. study previously suggested wild chimpanzees that are naturally infected with SIVcpz exhibit AIDS-like immunopathology and higher rates of mortality than uninfected chimpanzees (50). however, it is technically difficult to conduct experiments that characterize the pathogenic effects of SIVcpz infection in vivo. our findings suggest that pandemic HIV-1 (i.e., HIV-1M) has emerged partly due to the preadaptation of certain SIVcpzPtt strains, such as MB897. our findings support a hypothesis that the exposure of certain MB897-related SIVcpzPtt viruses to humans in central africa resulted in the emergence of pandemic HIV-1 following initial preadaptation. the acute viremia in PB of HIV-1N-infected humanized mice was lower than that of SIVcpzPtt MB897-infected mice. previous molecular virology studies have shown that the Vpu proteins of HIV-1N and SIVcpzPtt EK505 are less efficient at degrading CD4 molecules than the Vpu proteins of HIV-1M and SIVcpzPtt MB897. human tetherin works as a factor of intrinsic herd immunity against HIV-1. but HIV-1M Vpu overcomes human tetherin-mediated herd immunity. this suggests the importance of Vpu-mediated human tetherin antagonism in viral spread throughout the human population. this is the first study to demonstrate an adaptive mutation of SIVcpzPtt MB897 to infect humans in vivo. gp120 G413R mutation may improve the ability of SIVcpzPtt MB897 to use human CD4 and/or CCR5 as opposed to chimpanzee receptors. this issue is intriguing and will be addressed in a future investigation. we used an MA M30R derivative of SIVcpzPtt MB897 to assess differences in replication efficiency. this derivative was significantly higher than parental MB897 in in vitro culture of activated human CD4+ T cells. the impact of the amino acid at position 30 of MA may depend on the experimental systems used. the levels of chronic vRNA of the mice infected with HIV-1N, SIVcpzPtt EK505 and SIVcpzPtt MT145 were significantly lower than that of mice infected with HIV-1M. this is the first report directly demonstrating the adaptation of SIVcpz to humans in vivo. we tested the viral fitness of two HIV-1 groups, M and N, both of which originated from the cross-species transmission of SIVcpzPtt. the first study recapitulating the viral pathogenesis of HIV-1N in an in vivo model and providing insights into virological characteristics of HIV-1N. all protocols involving human subjects were reviewed and approved by the institutional review board of Kyoto University. the authors received approval from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC)/ethics committee of the institutional review board of Kyoto University. 4 96 F B 120,000 Mock 14 5 96 M B 120,000 Mock 14 6 165 F C 170,000 MB897 14 7 165 M C 170,000 JRCSF 14 8
