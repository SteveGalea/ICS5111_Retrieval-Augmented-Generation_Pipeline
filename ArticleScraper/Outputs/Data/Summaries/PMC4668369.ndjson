{"summary": "a plasmid encoding ORF4b was transfected into HeLa cells. a subcellular localization of ORF4b protein was observed. a plasmid encoding ORF4b was observed. 293T cells were transfected with increasing amounts of an expression plasmid for HA-tagged ORF4b protein. cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Caspase-3 and anti-PARP antibodies. ORF4b inhibits the induction of IFN- in a dose-dependent manner. reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments were performed. 293T cells were transfected with expression plasmids for flag-tagged RIG-I, MDA5, IKK, TBK1, and GFP-tagged IRF3 and MAVS with ORF4b. ORF4b can inhibit IFN- expression by targeting MDA5, TBK1 and IKK. 293T cells were co-transfected with expression plasmids for HA-tagged ORF4b protein and indicated transducer proteins. input cell lysates and immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting. 293T cells were not stimulated with SeV but co-transfected with plasmids expressing MDA5, RIG-I, MAVS, TBK1, IRF3 and IRF7. ORF4b inhibited the induction of IFN- by RIG-I, MDA5, MAVS, TBK1, IRF3 and IRF7. we hypothesized that abolishing the nuclear import of ORF4b would result in its inability to inhibit IRF3-induced production of IFN-. we constructed a truncated ORF4b with a deletion of the N-terminal 2\u201338 amino acids (aa). 293T cells co-transfected with ORF4b and either Flag-MDA5C or Flag-MDA5H. ORF4b protein does not affect formation of the complex between MDA5 and MAVS. 293T cells were co-transfected with expression plasmids for HA-tagged ORF4b protein. plasmid expressing HA-tagged ORF4b or empty vector were analyzed. ORF4b does not disrupt formation of complex between MDA5 and MAVS. the capacity of ORF4b to inhibit IRF3 phosphorylation was tested using a transfection assay. a significant decrease in cells simultaneously expressing IKK/TBK1 and ORF4b protein was found in all groups of cells. the 293T cells were co-transfected with different combinations of expression plasmids for HA-tagged ORF4b protein and FLAG-tagged TBK1/IKK. cells were then stained for ORF4b and TBK1/IKK with anti-HA and anti-FLAG antibodies. the green (IRF3), red (TBK1/IKK), and blue (ORF4b) fluorescent signals were merged. TBK1 and IKK results in phosphorylation of IRF-3 or IRF-7, translocation to the nucleus, and induction of IFN- mRNA transcription and translation. the finding that ORF4b protein binds IKK and TBK1 suggests that ORF4b may block the interaction between IKK or TBK-1 and their IRF substrates. ORF4b protein suppresses formation of the IKK and MAVS complex. 293T cells were co-transfected with IKK and MAVS. co-immunoprecipitation was assessed by Western blotting. a plasmid encoding ORF4b was transfected into HeLa cells. a subcellular localization of ORF4b protein was observed. unlike SARS ORF3b27, ORF4b-expressing cells did not show growth defects. 293T cells were transfected with increasing amounts of an expression plasmid for HA-tagged ORF4b protein. cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Caspase-3 and anti-PARP antibodies. ORF4b inhibits induction of IFN- in a dose-dependent manner. 293T cells were transfected with expression plasmids for flag-tagged RIG-I, MDA5, IKK, TBK1, and GFP-tagged IRF3 and MAVS with ORF4b. similar expression levels of both ORF4b protein and the transducer proteins were observed in 293T cells. the 293T cells were co-transfected with expression plasmids for HA-tagged ORF4b protein. the indicated transducer proteins included GFP-tagged MAVS and IRF3, FLAG-tagged IKK, TBK1, MDA5, and RIG-I. input cell lysates and immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting. 293T cells were not stimulated with SeV but co-transfected with plasmids expressing MDA5, RIG-I, MAVS, TBK1, IRF3 and IRF7. data are representative of three independent experiments with triplicate samples. ORF4b inhibited the induction of IFN- by RIG-I, MDA5, MAVS, IKK, IRF3 and IRF7. 4b(2-38) localizes to the cytoplasm and cannot inhibit IRF3 induced production of IFN-. 4b(2-38) localizes to the cytoplasm and cannot inhibit IRF3 induced production of IFN-. ORF4b protein does not affect formation of the complex between MDA5 and MAVS. 293T cells were co-transfected with ORF4b and either flag-MDA5C or flag-MDA5H. a stronger interaction was observed with MDA5C. ORF4b protein mainly interacts with the amino terminus MDA5. 293T cells were co-transfected with expression plasmids for HA-tagged ORF4b protein. input cell lysates and immunoprecipitates were analyzed by western blotting. 4b to inhibit IRF3 phosphorylation was tested using a transfection assay. phosphorylated IRF3 was detected in cultured 293T cells expressing IKK/TBK1 alone. but with a significant decrease in cells simultaneously expressing IKK/TBK1 and ORF4b protein. 93T cells were co-transfected with different combinations of expression plasmids for HA-tagged ORF4b protein and FLAG-tagged TBK1/IKK. cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE for subsequent analysis with anti-FLAG (-FLAG), anti-HA(-HA), anti-phosphoIRF3 (-p-IRF3), anti-IRF3 (-IRF3), and anti-Actin (-Actin) co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed. first, cells were co-transfected with IKK/TBK1 and IRF-3 plasmids. results showed both IKK/TBK1 pulled down IRF3, whereas there was no difference between absence and presence of ORF4b. 293T cells were co-transfected with IKK and MAVS, along with ORF4b-expressing plasmid or an empty vector. co-immunoprecipitation was assessed by Western blotting using both antibodies. the results indicate that ORF4b protein suppresses the complex. nsp1, PLP, nsp7, nsp15, N, M, ORF3b, ORF6, and ORF9b31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41. previous studies have shown that MERS-CoV infection failed to elicit strong type I or III IFN or pro-inflammatory innate immune responses in ex vivo respiratory tissue cultures11,12. the interaction between ORF4b and MDA5 may not contribute to ORF4b-mediated inhibition of IFN- induction by impairing formation of the MDA5 and MAVS complex. however, ORF4b specifically reduced IKK and TBK1-mediated IRF3 phosphorylation. ORF4b did not disrupt the IKK/TBK1-IRF3 or IKK/TBK1-IRF7 complex. the capacity of ORF4b to target the IKK-MAVS interaction suggests that ORF4b may be able to at least partially prevent the activation of IKK and TBK-1 kinases. it remains unclear whether ORF4b can also inhibit IKK/TBK1 kinase activity through some other mechanism. viral proteins have been shown to inhibit the production of IFN-, RIG-I, MDA5, MAVS, IKK, or TBK-1. the NS1 protein of Influenza is one of the most well-understood interferon antagonist among viral proteins. NS1 specifically binds to TRIM25 and subsequently inhibits the ubiqitination of RIG-I. in the nucleus, NS1 can inhibit the maturation and export of cellular mRNAs including IFN- transcripts. there may be some shared anti IFN mechanisms, especially in the nucleus.
