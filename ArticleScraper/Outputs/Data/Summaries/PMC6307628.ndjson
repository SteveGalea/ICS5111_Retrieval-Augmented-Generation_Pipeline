{"summary": "114 pregnant Indian pilgrims were identified during the study period. most common antenatal complications were respiratory tract infections (51.75%), followed by iron deficiency anaemia (17.54%), hyperemesis gravidarum (14.04%), hypothyroidism (9.65%) and gestational diabetes mellitus (5.26%). all female pilgrims between 15\u201345 years old with amenorrhoea who were seen at secondary care IHMM hospitals during the study period underwent pregnancy screening. all pregnant patients identified during Hajj as well as those who registered their pregnancies in Indian hospitals prior to their arrival in Saudi Arabia were included in the study as part of a convenience inclusive sampling strategy. patients requiring fetal monitoring, perinatal care and neonatal intensive care were also transferred to the Makkah Maternity & Children Hospital. all patients were followed up by IHMM-affiliated doctors throughout their entire stay in Saudi Arabia and, when necessary, were transferred to India under medical supervision. all of the women had received oral poliomyelitis, combined seasonal influenza and influenza A subtype H1N1 and meningococcal (serogroups A, C, Y and W-135) vaccines prior to their arrival in Saudi Arabia. there were no reported cases of calf pain or deep vein thrombosis. patients with GDM were prescribed 500 mg of metformin three times daily to ensure good glycaemic control. those with hyperemesis gravidarum were admitted to hospital for supportive care and received intravenous fluids. the most common adverse early pregnancy outcomes were missed (23.68%) or threatened (8.77%) abortions. there were 20 vaginal deliveries (17.54%) and two Caesarean deliveries (1.75%). four of the women with threatened abortions were admitted for progesterone support. one patient experienced the demise of a single fetus at 29 gestational weeks. another pregnancy ended in intrauterine fetal demise at 29 gestational weeks due to ultrasonography-confirmed oligohydramnios. n (%) 95% CI 2015 (n = 12) 2016 (n = 4) 2017 (n = 6) Total Alive and well 10 (83.33) 4 (100) 5 (83.33) 19 (86.36) 0.64\u20130.96 Low birth weight 2 (16.67) 0 (0) 2 (33.33) 4 (18.18) 0.06\u20130.41 Low Apgar score 2 (16.67) 0 (0) 1 (16.67) 3 (13.64) 0.03\u20130.36 Preterm 2 (16.67) two preterm babies were born as a result of preterm labour occurring in a twin pregnancy. many pregnant women are likely to covertly attempt Hajj pilgrimage, perhaps for religious or financial reasons. there are no approved antiviral drugs for treating novel respiratory pathogens. hospitalisation can further increase the transmission of respiratory pathogens. however, sociolinguistic and ethnocultural differences are barriers to proposed measures. pregnant women with high-risk pregnancies, a history of preterm labour, recurrent pregnancy losses, GDM, chronic hypertension, pre-eclampsia, heart disease and those in the third trimester postpone Hajj pilgrimage. if determined to proceed, pregnant women should consult an obstetrician prior to embarking on Hajj and travel with sufficient medications for the entire pilgrimage."}
