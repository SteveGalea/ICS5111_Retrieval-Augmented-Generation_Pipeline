{"summary": "Wu et al reported an outbreak at an elementary school of 698 pupils in anhui province, china. twenty-eight serologically confirmed cases aged between 7 and 13 years with symptom onset from 7 May to 8 June 2011 were reported. all the cases in this outbreak (except boy A) were children born before 2006 and had not received free vaccination. about 40% of the symptomatic cases did not recall close contact with jaundiced persons. 53.5% of 144 pupils at the school who were without symptoms were positive for the IgG antibodies tests. these two facts suggest transmission occurs from asymptomatic cases as well as from symptomatic cases. methods We use three different statistical methods to estimate the basic reproductive number R0 and related quantities. for these statistical methods, asymptomatic infections are ignored. we also use transmission dynamics model to describe the asymptomatic and symptomatic infections. method [9] is a development of method of [10] by further combining partly known contact information among cases with the time intervals in symptom onset between cases. the method assumes that observed serial intervals are positive random variables described by a serial interval distribution, g(t |), here assumed to be a gamma distribution with parameter set = shape, rate. cases i and j, g(ti-tj|), times the probability of a potentially infectious contact between i and j, ij, normalized by the probability of a potentially infectious contact between i and j, ij. ij = 1/(number of suspected sources of infection) for j equal to one of the \u201csuspected source of infection\u201d and ij = 0 for others j. the effective reproductive numbers along the outbreak can then be estimated by summing over all the infectious contacts up to time t [10], R t = j i = 2 p i j ( v, w ; t t c. ws represent the probability mass function of the serial interval of length s days, which can be obtained by ws = G. R0 represents the reproductive number in the absence of any control or susceptible depletion. this allows using of R0 instead of the instantaneous reproductive number (the average number of people someone infected at time t can infect over their entire infectious lifespan) the basic reproductive number, R0exp for exponential growth [15], can be approximated by the average number of secondary cases generated by initial cases during the first generation interval Tg (assumed to be fixed) as, R 0 exp = exp ( r T g) (7) For sub-exponential growth models, the three parameters r, p and C0 will be estimated by Bayesian inference, and the reproductive number can be further obtained. in the above equation parameter (t) is introduced to reflect the time-varying contact rate due to the pupil\u2019s response and countermeasures induced during the outbreak. the basic reproductive number before interventions at day tc is, R 0 = ( 1 / 1 + 1 / 2 ) (10A) and after the collective interventions it becomes R c = ( 1 / 1 + 1 / 2 ) (10B) model parameters are assumed to be uniformly distributed with ranges wide enough to include the possible values. the variation in the daily number of symptomatic cases is assumed to follow the negative binomial distribution with dispersion parameter. I0 number of occult infections (infectious but not symptomatic) on 10 March 2011 U(0,200) 7.12[0.57,31.8] 0.61[0.03,4.10] Reduction in contact rate U(0,1) 0067[0.002,0.431] 0.040[0.002,0.236] tcc Turning point in contact rate U(L/3,L-7) 75.7[67.5,89.4] 74.4[67.0,85.3] Proportion the serial interval can range from the latent period to the sum of latent period and whole period of occult infection and symptomatic infection. six different combinations of life history stages are considered conditional on a same average serial interval. the information about the contact and symptom onset of 32 cases has been extracted from Figs 1 and 2 of [3]. the details are listed in Table 2. Table 2. Outbreak data. the method [9] is a development of method of [10] by further combining partly known contact information among cases with the time intervals in symptom onset between cases to construct the transmission tree. the method assumes that observed serial intervals are positive random variables described by a serial interval distribution, g(t |), here assumed to be a gamma distribution. the probability, ij, is based on the contact information (v,w) of both cases i and j collected during the outbreak. ij = 1/(number of suspected sources of infection) for j equal to one of the \u201csuspected source of infection\u201d and ij = 0 otherwise. t = j i = 2 p i j ( v, w ; v, w ; v, w ; t t c. ws represent probability mass function of serial interval of length s days, which can be obtained by ws = G ( s ) (5) with G(.) representing the cumulative distribution function of the gamma distribution. the reproductive number reduces from R0 to Rc. the value of Rc shows the impact of countermeasures. this allows using of R0 instead of the instantaneous reproductive number. transmission tree method We first re-construct the transmission tree during the outbreak and estimate serial interval, and evolution of transmissibility along the outbreak. the method is a development of method of [10] by further combining partly known contact information among cases with the time intervals in symptom onset between cases to construct the transmission tree. the probability, ij, is based on the contact information (v,w) of both cases i and j collected during the outbreak. ij = 1/(number of suspected sources of infection) for j equal to one of the \u201csuspected source of infection\u201d and ij = 0 otherwise. simplest formulation of the renewal equation [11], the epidemic grows exponentially to infinity. some interventions had been taken to control the continuing infection such as isolating affected patients in hospitals, placing members of these cases\u2019 families and other contacts under medical observations. tc represents the reproductive number in the absence of any control or susceptible depletion. this allows using of R0 instead of the instantaneous reproductive number (the average number of people someone infected at time t can infect over their entire infectious lifespan) transmission dynamics model We consider the realistic situation where not all infections are symptomatic. a proportion of occult infection () become symptomatic (D) and the rest remain asymptomatic but infectious (A) in the above equation parameter (t) is introduced to reflect the time-varying contact rate due to the pupil\u2019s response and countermeasures induced during the outbreak. the basic reproductive number before interventions at day tc is, R 0 = ( 1 / 1 + 1 / 2 ) (10A) and after the collective interventions it becomes R c = ( 1 / 1 + 1 / 2 ) (10B) the total likelihood function for estimating the model parameters is composed of two parts. negative binomial likelihood that describes the variation on the observation of symptomatic cases D ( t ), t = 1,..., 90 from 10 March to 8 June 2011. tcc Turning point in contact rate U(0,1) 0067[0.002,0.431] 0.040[0.002,0.236] tcc Turning point in contact rate U(L/3,L-7) 75.7[67.5,89.4] 74.4[67.0,85.3] Proportion of symptomatic infections U(0,1) 0.085[0.053,0.134] 1.0 Dispersion parameter U(1.01,40) 1.71[1.14,3.40] 1.71 the serial interval can range from the latent period to the sum of latent period and whole period of occult infection. six different combinations of life history stages are considered conditional on a same average serial interval. there are 15 cases each of those has a unique likely infector. the serial interval was estimate to have a mean of 23.9 days and standard deviation of 20.9 days. 95% of serial intervals were predicted to lie with the range 1.6 to 79.1 days. infector-infectee pairs have a mean of 7.7 days, which substantially reduces the overall pooled mean. the shortness of the serial interval of reconstructed infector-infectee pairs must have been due to ignorance of contribution of asymptomatic infections. we regard the direct estimate as the reasonable serial interval distribution and use it in other analyses. R0 was calculated as the average reproductive number before 26 May 2011. before this date most infector-infectee pairs were fixed by data. we can easily calculate generation-based reproductive number Rg. this is defined as the average number of infections in the next generation that were generated by the cases in current generation. general growth model was based on the priors: U(0.002,0.3), U(0,1) and U(0,10) for growth rate, deceleration exponent and the number of initial accumulative cases. the growth rate has a median 0.0358 and 95% confidence interval ranging from 0.0339 to 0.0379. the turning point occurs at day 76 since 10 March 2011. the effect of countermeasures on contact rate is = 0.067 [0.002,0.431] the basic reproductive number before effective countermeasures is R0 = 2.69 [1.90,3.92] and under countermeasures it reduces to Rc = 0.186 [0.006,0.969] is collectively started from day 77 with 95% confidence interval [72,81] from 10 Mar 2011. the reproductive number before this turning point is R0 = 2.82 [1.70, 4.50]. after this point, it reduces to Rc = 0.17 [0.05, 0.50], indicating transmission is well under control. is equal to the direct estimate from observed infector-infectee pairs, 23.9 days, R0 from Eq (7) is estimated to have a mean 2.35 and 95% confidence interval [2.24,2.48] the number of initial accumulative cases C0 has median 1.03 and 95% confidence interval [1.00,1.15] three different combinations of three durations were examined. the estimates of R0 are not very sensitivity to the variation in three durations given the same serial interval. the dispersion of the negative binomial likelihood in Eq (11) is very close to the unit for all the above different situations. only 10.6% (10/94) of the IgM-anti-HAV positive cases had clinical symptoms. our estimates of R0 are in agreement with that obtained by [21, 22] gay et al [21] used serological data collected in 1986/7 to estimate average annual incidence in 5\u201314 year olds. estimate has a long tail with 95% confidence interval ranging from about 2 to 79 days. changes in simple phenomenological models have been proposed. for the 2011 outbreak in anhui province, the overall mean of reproductive number through the whole outbreak is 0.969, with a standard deviation of 0.106. the only available data are about symptomatic infections or so at least at the early stage of the outbreak. if the proportion of symptomatic infections remains unchanged over the outbreak, the estimate of R0 based only on symptomatic cases should give similar results."}
