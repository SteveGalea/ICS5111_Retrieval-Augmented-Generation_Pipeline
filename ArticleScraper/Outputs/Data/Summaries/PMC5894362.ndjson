{"summary": "a novel porous scaffold poly (lactide-co-glycolide) and tricalcium phosphate (PLGA/TCP) was developed by three-dimensional printing technology for bone defect repair. a headspace gas chromatography-mass spectrometric (HS-GC-MS) method and related testing protocol were developed for quantitative determination of 1,4-dioxane in the PLGA/TCP composite scaffolds. quantitative method for determination of residual 1,4-dioxane in novel scaffolds is a key technical method during its translation into clinical use. the method is an important and indispensable file in the enterprise standard when the porous scaffold is registered as a class III implanted medical device for bone defect repair. 1,4-dioxane was defined as a Class 2 solvent associated with less severe toxicity, which should be limited to below 380 ppm according to international regulations. it was reported that 1,4-dioxane was determined reliably in water by various techniques including direct aqueous injection, purge and trap gas chromatography-mass spectrometric (GC-MS) headspace GC-MS (HS-GC-MS) was used in the determination of poorly purged organic solvents in cosmetics [31] as it could reach the target compound to eliminate background interference in special boiling point of volatile organic compounds. HS-GC-MS was chosen as an analysis method for scaffolds to simplify the pretreatment process and acquire high quantity chromatogram or spectrum. PLGA was dissolved in 1,4-dioxane at a ratio of 1:5 (weight/volume) the scaffolds were lyophilised to remove the solvent during fabrication. the surface morphologies of the prepared scaffold sections were observed by scanning electron microscopy at 15 kV and 5.0 m. 0.1 mL, and 0.05 mL of standard stock solution (1000 ppm) were transferred to five 10 mL volumetric flasks with Na2CO3, separately, diluted with DMF to volume, and then mixed to obtain 1 ppm standard solution. standard solutions including matrix blank scaffolds were transferred to a headspace vial, and five parallels were prepared. l was performed in the selective ion (masses 88) mode. the sample was quantified by the external standard method. blanks and check standards comprised 30% of the total samples analysed. method validation Specificity describes the ability of an analytical method to separate the analysts of interest accurately from other components expected to be present in samples. guiding principle 9101 [26] provides identification requirements and criteria for specificity testing. two standards of 25 ppm were processed by two different research assistants in 2 days. each sample was analyzed six times. limit of detection and limit of quantitation is the lowest amount that can be quantified accurately, defined as the concentration required to give a signal to noise ratio. each column detected samples in triplicate. the content of 1,4-dioxane was compared with different scaffolds. tests were performed using SPSS 16.0 software (Chicago, IL, USA) a ratio of 1:5 (weight/volume) was mixed with the solution at a ratio of 1:4 (weight/weight) (TCP:PLGA) the scaffolds were lyophilised to remove the solvent during fabrication. PLGA was dissolved in dimethylsulphoxide instead of in 1,4-dioxane. five 10 mL volumetric flasks were transferred to a 10 mL volumetric flask. the flask was diluted with DMF to volume and mixed to obtain 1 ppm standard solution. standard solutions included matrix blank scaffolds, which were cut into pieces of 0.2 0.2 cm3. GC/MS analysis HS-GC tandem MS was used to identify and quantify 1,4-dioxane. an Agilent (California, USA) 7890B GC was used for all separations. guiding principle 9101 [26] provides identification requirements and criteria for specificity testing. 0.3 g scaffold was dissolved with 4 mL DMF. 1,4-dioxane in the products should be no more than 380 ppm. two standards of 25 ppm were processed by two different research assistants in 2 days. each sample was analyzed six times using the same method. limit of detection is the lowest amount that can be quantified accurately. 0.3 g scaffold was dissolved with 4 mL DMF. the concentration of 1,4-dioxane in the products should be no more than 380 ppm. two standards of 25 ppm were processed by two different research assistants in 2 days. each sample was analyzed six times. limit of detection and limit of quantitation is the lowest amount that can be quantified accurately. the peak areas of 1,4-dioxane in different extracts were presented as means standard deviation of three repeated experiments. the scaffolds had well interconnected macropore structures (Figure 1B), and numerous micropores were observed on the wall surface of the scaffold framework. 4-dioxane in each concentration of calibration curves without matrix were twice that of those in which matrix was dissolved with Na2CO3\u2014H2O. the difference was not found between the calibration curves with or without matrix blank scaffolds dissolved with DMF. the tailing factor of this target peak was 2.26, and the number of theoretical plates was 36,954. extract ion gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) of 1,4-dioxane of sample. the linear range for 1,4-dioxane was determined as 1\u201340 ppm. the calibration curves were linear for all the standard components. the results showed that the resolution, tailing factor, and the number of theoretical plates when the column was changed to DB-624 met the system suitability requirements. scaffolds should be freeze-dried for 2 days and then dried in vacuum more than 7 days to control the content of 1,4-dioxane. scaffolds should be frozen for 2 days and then dried in vacuum more than 7 days to satisfy the safety limit. scaffolds were lyophilised for 2 days and dried at 37\u00b0C in 0 days, 3 days, 6 days, 7 days, and 9 days in vacuum drying oven. the concentrations of standard dissolved with Na2CO3\u2014H2O were 6.25 ppm, 12.5 ppm, 25 ppm, 50 ppm, and 100 ppm. the concentration of standard dissolved with DMF were 1 ppm, 5 ppm, 10 ppm, 20 ppm, and 40 ppm. gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) of 1,4-dioxane of sample.
