{"summary": "despite advances in medical diagnosis and treatment, no studies have examined consultation time and patient centeredness in Korea. despite significant advances in medical diagnosis and treatment, no studies have examined consultation time and patient centeredness. the average consultation time per person at general hospitals in the united states is between 6.2 to 7.4 minutes. while the average consultation time per person varied substantially across hospitals in the united states, it was more than 20 minutes, with only 6% of the physicians spending less than 9 minutes with patients. a 6-month study took place in the largest public tertiary hospital in Korea. patients with first-visit consultations for serious and non-curable diseases were assigned to an in-depth consultation group or a control group. we aimed to explore the differences in patient-centeredness, willingness to pay, and physician's professionalism. the second consultation explained the diagnosis reached upon initial examination and utilized shared decision making to choose further treatment actions. participants two research nurses and a specialized physician conducted a secondary gate-keeping of patients for in-depth consultation. Statistical analysis Data for baseline characteristics were presented as mean standard deviation, number, and percentage. differences in perceived and preferred consultation time were tested using the Student's t test. the first consultation was an examination of the previous medical records and a comprehensive assessment of the patient. the second consultation explained the diagnosis reached upon initial examination and utilized shared decision making to choose further treatment actions. control patients were selected from those visiting the same physician by matching age and gender with those in the in-depth consultation group. participation protocol Patients visiting the tertiary hospital for the first time could only be enrolled if they fit the protocol of the 13 participating departments. participants possessed a referral letter from their primary care physician explaining why the referral was recommended and what medical services were anticipated. the in-depth consultation group was asked about their willingness to pay for the service they received. five of them were internal medicine specialists, four were surgeons, and four were pediatric specialists. they were asked about their ongoing participation in increased consultation time. one hundred patients (36.5%) requested in-depth consultation in an acute-care community hospital (above 400 beds) this was not statistically different from that observed in the control group (35.0%, 49 patients). the in-depth consultation group exhibited higher severity, with 32.8% of the participants exhibiting severe diseases compared to 27.8% in the control group. the level of understanding of the physician's explanations was significantly higher at 3.74 in the in-depth consultation group vs. 3.28 in the control group (P 0.001). 92.4% of participants reported that the consultation time was sufficient, but only 69.0% of those in the control group responded the same (P 0.001). two hundred and twenty-three patients (81.4%) in the in-depth consultation group and 94 patients (67.1%) in the control group reported willingness to pay additional costs for in-depth consultation. scores on physician\u2013patient rapport and health literacy were statistically higher for pediatricians than for physicians from the internal medicine and surgery departments. the level of understanding of the physician's explanations was significantly higher at 3.74 in the in-depth consultation group vs. 3.28 in the control group. 92.4% of participants reported that the consultation time was sufficient, only 69.0% of. the in-depth consultation group exhibited higher scores on all three items pertaining to the treatment process. scores on 3 out of 4 items regarding protection of patient rights were significantly higher among participants in the in-depth consultation group. scores on physician\u2013patient rapport and health literacy were statistically higher for pediatricians than for physicians from the internal medicine and surgery departments. ninety-two percent of the physicians reported they would participate in in-depth consultation in future. one physician (from internal medicine) reported that he would not do so. the \u201c3-Minute Consultation\u201d is a model for developing a Korean version of PCC. the fee-for-service delivery system regulates the content and finances of the physicians' consultation but it lacks regulations on the quality of care. in the present pilot project, the consultation time was the only variable factor affected by increasing the government-determined compensation fee. jkms-34-e119-s001.xls was the first study on PCC in Korea. it highlighted the importance of sufficient consultation time in the currently distorted healthcare delivery system."}
