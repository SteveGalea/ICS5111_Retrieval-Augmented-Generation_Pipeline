{"summary": "infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) is a highly contagious acute respiratory disease of chickens caused by the avian alphaherpesvirus. the disease has a worldwide distribution and is frequently observed in densely populated poultry production areas. ILTV infection appears to down-regulate type I interferon transcription. the avian immune system lacks a discrete lymphatic network. chickens have a distributed immune network featuring clusters of mucosal-associated lymphoid tissues. assessing changes in immune cell populations within the eye-associated lymphoid tissues (CALT and HG) after ILTV exposure may help identify important features occurring in mucosal tissues that are involved in ILTV pathogenesis. this study highlights the important role of the eye-associated lymphoid tissue and the immunity elicited against ILTV infection. kidney cells were disassociated in a 0.25% trypsin solution (Corning, Cellgro) at 37 \u00b0C. cell pellets were resuspended in incomplete media (1x Ham\u2019s media (Corning, Cellgro), 1 M 199 (Gibco), 2% tryptose phosphate broth, 0.62% 1M Hepes buffer, 1.2% Sodium bicarbonate (Sigma)) chickens were arbitrarily divided in three groups at five weeks-of-age. one group of chickens was inoculated with virulent strain 63140 (n = 75); a second group was inoculated with the CEO vaccine strain (n = 75) the third group of chickens (n = 65) was mock inoculated with cell culture media in similar fashion. each chicken received a total clinical sign score, which was the sum of individual clinical signs categories. a total mean clinical signs score was calculated per group at each time point post-infection. samples were kept on ice until the tissues were processed for flow cytometry analysis. eluted RNA was treated with TURBO DNA-freeTM (2 to 4 units/per reaction) a total of 80 units of RNase inhibitor (RNase OUTTM, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was added per sample. a real time PCR reaction was performed to ensure the absence of residual DNA in the eluted RNA using primers previously described. cDNA synthesis was performed in 20-L reactions including 250 to 500 nanograms of RNA, 200 units of reverse transcriptase and 200 nM oligo primers. total DNA from CALT and HG was extracted from organic phenol phase of the TRIzol\u00ae homogenate following manufacturer\u2019s recommendations. sections stained with haematoxylin and eosin were subjected to microscopic examination for signs of ILTV lytic replication. single-cell suspensions from CALT and HG tissues were obtained by mechanical disruption using a 60-m wire screen mesh (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Luis, MO, USA) isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated to mouse anti-chicken CD8 (Clone CT8) and APC conjugated mouse anti-chicken CD45. PE-conjugated mouse anti-chicken IgM (Clone M-1) paired with FITC-conjugated mouse anti-chicken MHCI (Clone 2G11) and APC conjugated mouse anti-chicken CD45. cell suspensions were diluted with 200 L of calcium and magnesium-free PBS. prior to flow cytometry analysis fixed cell suspensions were diluted with 200 L of calcium and magnesium-free PBS. gating was based on size consistency and single cell using forward scatter height versus forward scatter area. representative flow cytometric forward-angle and right-angle scatter (FSC-A vs. SSC-A) gated on only CD45+ cells were used to identify the lymphocyte population (c) the CD45+ lymphocytes population was subjected to CD4+ and CD8+ (d), IgM+ and IgA+ (e), MHCI+ and MHCIIHi+ (f) assessment. oculated group of chickens used the chicken -actin transcript as an endogenous control. table 1 shows median fold change (log10 2Ct) and 95% confidence interval. the mean and median of each set of assessments did not show differences, thus the results are presented as the mean with standard deviation (SD). the one-way analysis of variance Kruskal\u2013Wallis test and the Dunn s multiple comparison post-test were used to individually compare CD4+, CD8+, IgM+, IgA+ and MHCI+/MHCIIHi+ percentage changes elicited after 63140, CEO, and mock inoculation in the CALT and the CEO vaccine strain was reconstituted as recommended by the manufacturers. both viral strains were titrated in chicken kidney cells prepared from 3 to 4-week-old SPF chickens. one-day-old chicks were housed in isolation units, with filtered air and negative pressure, and provided with feed and water ad libitum. one group of chickens was inoculated with virulent strain 63140 (n = 75); another was inoculated with CEO vaccine strain (n = 75) post-inoculation (pi) from 6 to 7 randomly selected chickens per group. signs of respiratory distress, lethargy and conjunctivitis were scored. each chicken received a total clinical sign score, which was the sum of individual clinical signs categories. eluted RNA was treated with TURBO DNA-freeTM (2 to 4 units/per reaction) a total of 80 units of RNase inhibitor (RNase OUTTM, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was added per sample. a real time PCR reaction was performed to ensure the absence of residual DNA in the eluted RNA. the cycling profile was 50 \u00b0C for 2 min; 95 \u00b0C for 2 min; 40 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 15 s; and 60 \u00b0C for 1 min. cDNA was stored at 20 \u00b0C until further real time PCR analysis. conjunctiva tissues were collected and placed in 10% buffered natural formalin and fixed for 24 h at room temperature. four-micrometer sections stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) were subjected to microscopic examination for the signs of ILTV lytic replication. allophycocyanin (APC) conjugated to mouse anti-chicken CD45, a pan leukocyte marker alone (Clone LT40, Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL, USA) Phyocoerythrin (PE) conjugated to mouse anti-chicken CD4 (Clone CT-4) paired with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated to mouse anti-chicken CD8 (Clone CT8) and A plates were centrifuged at 4 \u00b0C for 7 min at 250 g, cell pellets were washed once with 200 L of FACS buffer and centrifuged at 4 \u00b0C for 5 min at 250 g. cells were then re-suspended in 100 L of FACS buffer and 100 L of intracellular (IC) fixation buffer. 4000 and 3000 events were collected per CALT and HG. primary gating was based on size consistency and single cell using forward scatter height versus forward scatter area (fSC-H vs. FSC-A) and subjected to CD45 assessment (b) real-time PCRs were performed in the lightCycler 480II instrument. the IL-12p40, IFN- and Granzyme A genes relative transcription changes were determined as compared to the mock-inoculated group of chickens. the chicken -actin transcript was an endogenous control. non-parametric Mann\u2013Withney U test (p 0.05) was used to evaluate differences between CEO and 63140 genomes load in conjunctiva, Harderian gland and trachea at each time point post-inoculation (pi) the mean and median of each set of assessments did not show differences, thus the results are presented as the mean with standard deviation (SD). no chickens were euthanized due to the severity of clinical signs. from 4 to 7 days post-ocular inoculation, mortalities were not recorded. peak of clinical signs occurred at 5 dpi with mean total clinical signs score of 4.66 and 1.7. the CEO (5.78 log10) and 63140 (6.0 log10) mean genome load peaked in the HG at 3 dpi, began declining at 5 dpi, and mean genome load of 1.75 log10 and 2.20 log10 were detected in CEO and 63140 inoculate groups. a mean 63140 genome load of 3.85 log10 was obtained. conjunctiva epithelium of CEO-inoculated chickens showed focal syncytia cell formation with eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies. mild multifocal heterophilic infiltrates were detected in the conjunctiva epithelium of the CEO vaccine strain inoculated chickens. mild multifocal heterophilic infiltrates were detected in the conjunctiva epithelium of the conjunctiva sections from the CEO vaccine strain- and virulent 63140 strain-inoculated chickens collected at 1 (b), 3 (d), 5 (f), and 7 (h) dpi and from 63140-inoculated chickens collected at 1 (c), 3 (e), 5 (g), and 7 (i) days post-inoculation. changes in IgM+ and MHCI+/MHCIIHi+ cells, from 1 to 9 dpi, for both the 63140 and CEO groups of birds were very strongly correlated with coefficients (r) of 0.998 and 0.957 (p 0.0001). multiple comparison post-test (p 0.05) were performed to individually compare percentages for mock-, CEO-, and 63140-inoculated groups. the mean percentage is indicated by bars and vertical lines represent the standard deviation (SD) significant increase in IgM+, MHCI+/MHCIIHi+ cells is indicated by (**) and significant decrease by (*) no relevant association was found between IgM+ and IgA+ or MHCIIHi+ and IgA+ cells in the CALT or the HG for neither the 63140- nor CEO-inoculated birds. CD4+ cells decreased at 3 and 5 dpi, followed by a significant increase (p 0.05) at 7 dpi. the CD8+ cells population in the CALT of both the 63140- and CEO-inoculated birds were numerically increased at 1 dpi, decreased at 3 dpi, and increased again at 5 dpi. for the CEO-inoculated birds, the CD8+ cells significantly decreased at 7 dpi, followed by a significant (p 0.05) increase at 9 dpi. individual median fold change (log10 2Ct) transcription of the Granzyme A gene in the CALT of 63140 (a) and CEO (b) groups are presented in the y right axis (open square), with the median represented as the horizontal line and the 95% confident interval as the vertical line. Pearson correlation between Granzyme A expression and genome load from 3 to 9 dpi were determined for CALT/63140 (c) and CALT/CEO (d) individual median fold change (log10 2Ct) transcription of Granzyme A gene in the HG of 63140 (a) and CEO (b) groups are presented in the y right axis (open square), with the mean represented by the horizontal line and the standard deviation as the vertical line. a coordinated expression of IL-12p40 and IFN- Genes in the CALT and HG IL-12 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine. the most pronounced changes in IL-12p40 and IFN- gene expression in the CALT occurred from 1 to 5 dpi for either group of infected birds. in the CEO birds, the expression of IL-12p40 and IFN- genes yielded a strong correlation (r = 0.625, p = 0.0096) IL-12p40 gene transcription increased at 3 dpi and declined at 5 dpi. the clearest changes in IL-12p40 and IFN- genes expression induced by these viral strains occurred from 1 to 5 dpi. no chickens were euthanized due to severity of clinical signs. mean viral genome load in b, HG (c) and trachea measured at 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 dpi. the bars represent the mean viral genome load and the vertical lines indicate the standard deviation for each tissue. significant differences in viral genome load were measured between strains on the basis of the tissue assessed at each time point as indicated. both CEO and 63140 genomes persisted in the trachea on 7 and 9 dpi. no viral genome was detected in any of the tissues collected from mock-inoculated group of chickens. conjunctiva epithelium of CEO-inoculated chickens showed syncytial cells, eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies, marked necrosis, sloughing of the mucosa epithelium and mild heterophilic infiltrate. photomicrographs of conjunctiva epithelium collected from the CEO vaccine strain- and virulent 63140 strain-inoculated chickens. at 3 dpi a significant difference was observed for the percentage of MHCI+/MHCIIHi+ cells in the CALT of the 63140-inoculated birds. at 7 dpi, the percentage of IgM+ and MHCI+/MHCIIHi+ cells significantly decreased in the 63140 birds. Percentages of IgM+, MHCI+/MHCIIHi+ and IgA+ cells in the conjunctiva-associated lymphoid tissue (a,d), and IgA+ cells in CALT 1 to 9 days post-CEO (a\u2013c) and 63140 (d\u2013f) inoculation. the IgA+ cells in the HG at 3 dpi showed their highest levels for both the CEO- and 63140-inoculated groups. the IgA+ cells were significantly decreased for the CEO birds at 5 dpi, and for the 63140 birds at 9 dpi. percentage of CD4+ in CALT (a) and in HG (b) from 1 to 9 days post-CEO. percentage of CD8+ in CALT (c) and HG (d) from 1 to 9 days post-CEO. Granzyme A gene expression for both 63140 and CEO groups peaked between 3 and 5 dpi and the onset of virus genome decline started at 5 dpi. changes in the Granzyme A gene expression from 3 to 9 dpi showed a significant correlation. Granzyme A gene expression peaked at 5 dpi, which coincided with the onset of 63140 and CEO genome load decline. viral genome load declined in both the 63140 and CEO groups. no significant correlation was detected between Granzyme A gene expression and the decrease in 63140 or CEO viral genome load in the HG. IL-12p40 was downregulated in CEO-inoculated birds. the 63140-inoculated birds had a peak of IFN- expression on day 3 pi. at 1 dpi, the transcription of the IFN- gene was significantly higher. IFN- gene in the CALT (b) and HG (d) are presented as the median (bars) with 95% confident interval (lines) differences in median fold changes for IL-12p40 and IFN- between CEO and 63140 groups were determined by non-parametric Mann\u2013Whitney U test. the strong correlation between IgM+ and MHCI+/MHCIIHi+ cells in the CALT was indicative of an existing predominant subset of B cells expressing MHCI+/MHCIIHi+ in the tissues. the decline in this population at 7 and 9 dpi may indicate that activated B cells were undergoing isotype switching to IgY [26] this was after ILTV replication was no longer detected. it has been demonstrated that the immunomodulating effect of the viral glycoprotein G favors the recruitment of B cells over T cells to the trachea. this results in an enhanced humoral response, as indicated by an increase in circulating antibodies against ILTV. the CD4+ T cells population in the 63140-inoculated birds expanded by day 7 pi. this coincided with the decline in viral genome load. however, viral lytic replication persisted in the conjunctiva epithelium. a sustained expansion from 5 to 9 dpi coincided with the decline in viral genome load of CEO and 63140 genomes. changes of Granzyme A gene expression in the HG strongly correlated with the decline of CEO and 63140 genomes. chicken antigen presenting cells (APCs) produce IL-12p40. it is not known if chicken antigen presenting cells produce IL-12p40. however, it has been confirmed that chicken macrophages from peripheral blood, or bone marrow [32] and chicken thrombocytes [25] express a functional analog of the IL-12p40 gene. cytokines appear to be an important component in the balance of the immune response induced during ILTV infection. the injection of IFN- into mice prior to ocular inoculation with Herpesvirus simplex 1 (HSV-1) significantly increased virus replication in the eye, increased the number of latently infected trigeminal ganglia, and produced severe lesions in the cornea. thelium induced by the CEO vaccine strain was limited and resolved faster than those induced by the 63140 virulent strain. each strain induced the generation of IgA+ cells and an increase in the number of IgM+ and MHCI+/MHCIIHi+ cells. however, the immunomodulating factor in ILTV appears to promote this B cell activation bias. expansions of CD8+ cells, with the concomitant expression of the Granzyme A gene, are key to halting ILTV cytolytic replication in the conjunctiva. early upregulation of IL-12p40 and IFN- cytokine genes was incompatible with the decline in virus replication during acute infection."}
