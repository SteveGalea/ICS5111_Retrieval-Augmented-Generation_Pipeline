{"summary": "the earliest on record was the Plague of Athens between 429\u2013426 B.C.. the most infamous epidemic of plague was the \u201cBlack Death\u201d during 1346\u20131350. in the 20th century, three major influenza pandemics have killed over 75 million people combined. non-human primates (NHPs), the closest relative species to humans, are considered the gold standard animal model for many infectious diseases. animals are costly to acquire, difficult to handle, and require specialized facilities to house and provide husbandry. mice lacking the type I interferon (IFN) receptor (Ifnar\u2013/\u2013) were generated in 1994. these transgenic mice do not show overt abnormalities by six months of age. the animals are entirely unresponsive to the effects of type I IFNs. WNV was firstly identified in Uganda in 1937, but the majority of infections (80%) caused only mild disease or were asymptomatic. less than 1% of cases are neuroinvasive, in which patients present high fever, stupor, disorientation, coma, tremors, convulsions, muscle weakness, and paralysis. death occurred within 12\u201348 hours after the onset of symptoms. live infectious virus can be found in the muscle, heart, lung, kidney, liver, but not in the pancreas. disease is widespread in temperate and tropical regions of the world. shresta et al. challenged 5\u20136 week old Ifnar\u2013/\u2013 mice with DENV-2 strain PL046 (n=12) and DENV-1 strain Mochizuki (n=16) at the same doses and inoculation routes. a small percentage (15%) of cases will go on to develop more severe disease including jaundice, dark urine, vomiting and abdominal pain. Inoculation of wild-type 129 mice SC in each rear footpad with 104 pfu of YFV did not result in weight loss or death. mice developed viscerotropic disease with virus dissemination to the visceral organs, spleen and liver. EV strain JaOArS982 resulted in between 10%\u201340% survival. but the difference was not statistically significant and deaths were not dose-dependent. tens of thousands of people over 80 countries infected in early 2015. if present they are mild in nature and include fever, joint pain, maculopapular rash, and bloodshot eyes. if present they are mild in nature and include fever, joint pain, maculopapular rash, and bloodshot eyes. Ifnar\u2013/\u2013 mice all died within 8\u201310 dpi after challenge with H/PF/2013. 80% death with MR766, with death between 9\u201313 dpi. an SC challenge with 103 focus forming units (ffu) of ZIKV strain Dakar 41671, 41667 or 41519 results in uniform death by 6 dpi. large outbreaks of WNV occurred sporadically throughout the decades. during 1996 WNV re-emerged in Romania and caused 393 confirmed infections. subsequent epidemics of WNV with high rates of neuroinvasive disease was then noted in Morocco in 1996, Tunisia in 1997 and large outbreaks in Italy and Israel in 1998. live infectious virus can be found in muscle, heart, lung, kidney, liver, but not in the pancreas. challenge of Ifnar\u2013/\u2013 mice showed 100% lethality and a mean time to death of 3.40.5 dpi. mice deficient for the type I and II IFN receptors (AG129) showed uniform death from DENV-2 infection with animals dying between 7\u201330 dpi, and DENV-1 as well with mice succumbing to disease between 7\u201314 dpi. yFV is endemic in tropical areas of Africa and South America (WHO, 2016b), when the virus was introduced via the slave trade during the 17th century. mice developed viscerotropic disease with virus dissemination to the visceral organs, spleen and liver. increased levels of MCP-1 and IL-6 in these organs suggestive of a cytokine storm. encephalitis is an acute disease of the central nervous system in humans. Zika virus (ZIKV) first isolated in 1947 from an infected monkey in Uganda. re-isolated from Aedes mosquitoes in same area during 1948. in 2007 the virus continued spreading, causing outbreaks in small island countries. in adults is associated with Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome. sexual transmission of ZIKV from male-to-male (Deckard et al., 2016), male-to-female (Davidson et al., 2016) and female-to-male (Davidson et al., 2016) have been documented. a 103 focus forming units (ffu) of ZIKV strain Dakar 41671, 41667 or 41519 in Ifnar\u2013/\u2013 mice results in uniform death by 6 dpi. results showed 100% lethality in 3-week old animals with death occurring at 6\u20137 dpi. only 50% death in 5-week old animals and no deaths in 11-week old animals. the case fatality rate of EBOV and MARV can reach 90%. only one case of TAFV has been recorded, in which the patient fell ill. SUDV is 50%. all animals challenged with MARV succumbed to disease at a mean time to death. EBOV-infected mice died at an average of 8 dpi. clinical symptoms such as lethargy, weight loss and piloerection were observed prior to death. the CFR of RAVV cannot be estimated accurately since the only large scale outbreak during 1998\u20132000 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (128 deaths out of 154 cases) was due to the simultaneous co-circulation of RAVV and MARV. all animals challenged with MARV succumbed to disease at a mean time to death of 11\u201313 dpi. EBOV-infected mice died at an average of 8 dpi. clinical symptoms such as lethargy, weight loss and piloerection were observed prior to death. no deaths were observed with the mice, but the peak of viremia was detected at 8 dpi and still not fully cleared by 21 dpi. the results support the establishment of productive LASV infection in Ifnar\u2013/\u2013 mice. Lassa fever is prevalent in the west africa countries of Nigeria, Liberia, Sierra, Leone, Mali, Ghana, and Guinea. the peak of viremia (104.5-6 ffu/mL of blood) was detected at 8 dpi and still not fully cleared by 21 dpi. the results support the establishment of productive LASV infection in Ifnar\u2013/\u2013 mice. Approximately 50 cases are reported per year worldwide, but over 200 cases were reported during 2003\u20132004. infection of wild-type 129 Sv/Ew mice with CCHFV results in an infection that is rapidly cleared from the kidney, brain, heart and blood within 3 dpi. live CCHF of up to 104 TCID50/mg of tissue could be detected in the blood, lymph node and various major organs. in contrast, infection of wild-type C57BL/6 mice with CCHFV did not result in any pathology. the mice were highly susceptible to challenge, with all mice appearing ill by 3 dpi, resulting in death between 3\u20134 dpi. blood and major organs (brain, heart, kidney, intestine, liver, lung and spleen) were collected from infected mice daily. spread by Hyalomma ticks, cases of CCHFV infections in humans has been reported in western Asia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, as well as South Africa. Approximately 50 cases are reported per year worldwide, but over 200 cases were reported during 2003\u20132004. the highest viral loads in Ifnar\u2013/\u2013 mice were observed at 2 dpi in the spleen and liver. cec et al. infected 6\u201312 week old Ifnar\u2013/\u2013 mice with 104 TCID50 of CCHFV strain IbAr 2000. all animals died with an average time to death of 40, 5.20.6, 70 and 4.60.2 dpi. thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, strong pro-inflammatory responses were observed in these animals. ity rate amongst hospitalized patients can be up to 30%. infected wild-type mice (BALB/c, C57BL/6) results in limited weight loss but animals do not succumb to disease. all mice appearing ill by 3 dpi, resulting in death between 3 dpi. NiV was discovered in 1999 in Malaysia with spread to neighbouring Singapore. patients typically present with respiratory problems and fever, as well as encephalitis with symptoms of headache, drowsiness, disorientation and confusion, rapidly progressing to coma. the mice were uniformly susceptible with deaths between 6\u20139 dpi in the 106 pfu group. the LD50 was calculated to be 8103 pfu in Ifnar\u2013/\u2013 mice. infected mice with both viruses first showed behavioural changes. wild-type mice are only susceptible to HeV or NiV infection if the virus is administered via the intracranial (IC) route, but not through any other types of inoculations. the moribund mice died between 7\u201313 dpi. VEEV can infect and amplify in equine species, resulting in malaise, fever, headache and encephalitis. transmission of the virus to humans via the mosquito vector can result in the patient presenting with malaise, fever, headache and encephalitis. CHIKV outbreaks occurred mostly in central/southern Africa and southeast Asia during the 1960s\u20132000s. in recent years large-scale outbreaks have been reported on the island of Reunion. infected adult mice with 106 pfu of CHIKV does not result in mortality. VEEV can infect and amplify in equine species, resulting in encephalitis and progressive disorders in the central nervous system. transmission of the virus to humans via the mosquito vector can result in the patient presenting with malaise, fever, headache and encephalitis. Chikungunya fever is a severe illness in humans characterized by fever, headache, myalgia, rash, and acute as well as persistent arthralgia. despite considerable morbidity, the CFR is estimated to be 0.1%, with those older than 65 and/or underlying medical problems to be most at risk of death. mice (C57BL/6 background) SC in the footpad with 20 ffu of CHIKV found that all mice died within 4 dpi, but that these animals did not develop the arthritis observed in humans. SUMMARY Immunocompromised Ifnar\u2013/\u2013 mice have been shown to be a very good alternative small animal model for highly virulent pathogens that do not cause disease. 102 pfu 100% 96 hours 104 pfu 80 hours 106 pfu 64 hours ZIKV MP1751 5\u20136, 129Sv/Ev 106 pfu SC 100% 6 days Dowall et al., 2016 H/PF/2013 5\u20136, C57BL/6 102 pfu SC 8\u201310 days Lazear et al., 2016 MR766 9\u201313 days Dakar 41671 103 ff 103 ffu 3 days 105 ffu 2 days 106 ffu 2 days 6\u201312, C57BL/6 104 TCID50 IP 100% 4 0 days Zivcec et al., 2013 IN 7 0 days SC 4.6 0.2 days SFTSV YL-1 6\u201310, 129/Sv 106 ffu SC 100% 3\u20134 days IM 4 days SC 4 days ID 6 days HeV SD4 3, C57BL/6 Ifnar\u2013/\u2013 mice have defective innate immune responses which lead to impaired adaptive immunity. older mice may lose their susceptibility to the pathogen Virus adaptation to host via sequential passaging. ifnar\u2013/\u2013 mutation was found to prevent lethal pneumonia in mice. whereas the absence of human CD26 (a.k.a. DPP4) receptor for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) means that Ifnar\u2013/\u2013 mice must be first transduced with a human adenovirus serotype 5-vector expressing human CD26 in order to become transiently susceptible to MERS-CoV infection via the IN route. adapted virus to evade the host Type I IFN response is positively correlated with its virulence in the host. a future aim would be to establish small animal models for studying pathogen transmission."}
