{"summary": "the primate species analyzed are listed in supplementary table S4, Supplementary Material online. PAML Analysis Each gene alignment was fit to two codon models, M7 and M8, as implemented in PAML (Yang 1997). a likelihood ratio test was then performed, using 2 degrees of freedom, to assess whether M8 gives a significantly better fit to the data than M7 (positive selection not allowed) the primate species analyzed are listed in supplementary table S4, Supplementary Material online.
