{"summary": "PENK, NGAL, and eGFR were compared according to sepsis severity and absence of acute kidney injury. PENK was superior to NGAL in predicting AKI (P=0.022) and renal replacement therapy (RRT) PENK is a promising biomarker in critical care settings including sepsis. acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in critically ill patients. a decrease in urine output and an increase in serum creatinine (Cr) have been used as surrogate markers. proenkephalin (PENK; amino acids 119\u2013159 of proenkephalin A), a stable surrogate marker for endogenous enkephalins, has been suggested as a novel biomarker for AKI in perioperative and critical settings. we compared the levels of these two biomarkers using four different eGFR equations (MDRD Study and three CKD-EPI equations) all patients (n=167) Suspected sepsis (n=31) Sepsis (n=99) Septic shock (n=37) P* Age (yr), median [IQR] 70 [57\u201377] 67 [55\u201374] 70 [56\u201378] 72 [63\u201378] 0.3847 Male, n (%) 99 (59.3) 17 (54.8) 64 (64.6) 18 (48.6) 0.2053 Hospital stay (day), median [IQR] 14 eGFR CKD-EPICr (mL/min/1.73 m2), median [IQR] 70.2 [31.0\u2013100.5] 100.4 [94.1\u2013120.2] 63.4 [32.0\u201399.5] 31.2 [20.4\u201364.1] 0.000001 Data are expressed as median [interquartile range] or number (percentage) PENK, NGAL, serum Cr, and CysC concentrations were measured at the time of patient enrollment. the serum Cr delta value was assessed on the basis of the concentrations 48 hr post enrollment for AKI diagnosis. the medical records were reviewed without any identifiable information. eGFRs were calculated by using the MDRD Study equation and CKD-EPI equations using Cr, CysC, or Cr-CysC as variables with demographic variables. eGFRs were calculated by using the MDRD Study equation. Statistical analysis Data were checked for normal distribution by using the Shapiro-Wilk test and expressed as median and interquartile range or number and percentage. groups were compared by using the Mann-Whitney U test or the Kruskal-Wallis test. study population A total of 374 patients were under clinical suspicion of sepsis from December 2014 to June 2015. 99 patients (59.2%) were diagnosed as having sepsis, 37 patients (22.2%) as having septic shock and 31 patients (18.6%), who could not be included in the sepsis group according to the new definition, were arbitrarily grouped as suspected sepsis. 0.0003 30-day mortality, n (%) 30 (18.0) 1 (3.2) 11 (11.1) 18 (48.6) 0.0001 AKI by KDIGO criteria, n (%) 41 (24.6) 4 (12.9) 19 (19.2) 18 (48.6) 0.0005 RRT, n (%) 24 (14.7) 0 (0.0) 18 (18.1) 6 (16.2) 0.0393 PENK (pmol/L), median [IQR] 89.6 [54.2\u2013 median [IQR] 59.5 [27.5\u201390.4] 90.8 [76.1\u2013109.6] 53.8 [24.6\u201386.9] 29.7 [19.9\u201351.7] 0.000001 Data are expressed as median [interquartile range] or number (percentage) PENK assay plasma PENK was measured by using the sphingotest penKid assay (Sphingotec GmbH, Hennigsdorf, Germany), an immunoassay with monoclonal antibodies specific to the PENK peptide. standards (PENK peptide) and samples (100 L) were incubated in tubes with the detector antibody (150 L), the tubes were washed, and bound chemiluminescence was detected with a LB95 measured by using the sphingotest penKid assay (Sphingotec GmbH, Hennigsdorf, Germany), an immunoassay with monoclonal antibodies specific to the PENK peptide. standards (PENK peptide) and samples (100 L) were incubated in tubes with the detector antibody (150 L), the tubes were washed, and bound chemiluminescence was detected with a LB952T/16 luminometer (Bert the dynamic measuring range was 0.2\u201325 mg/dL. the mean within-laboratory imprecision was 2.7% during the study period. eGFRs were calculated by using the MDRD Study equation and CKD-EPI equations. agreement between the categorized groups was assessed by using the inter-rater agreement statistic (Kappa value) agreement between the categorized groups was assessed by using the inter-rater agreement statistic (Kappa value); agreement between the categorized groups was assessed by using the inter-rater agreement statistic (Kappa value); 0.21\u20130.40, fair; 0.41\u20130.60, moderate; 0.61\u20130.80, substantial; 0.81\u20131.00, almost perfect agreement [21]. CKD-EPICr and CKD-EPICr-CysC indicated normal kidney function (GFR60 mL/min/1.73 m2) of the eGFR equations, only CKD-EPICr and CKD-EPICr-CysC indicated normal kidney function (GFR60 mL/min/1.73 m2) ICr (mL/min/1.73 m2) 92.8 (85.9\u2013106.3) 100.5 (95.0\u2013120.7) 0.1573 21.9 (10.5\u201346.5) 71.3 (41.5\u2013102.0) 0.0001 25.7 (19.9\u201343.6) 29.5 (17.9\u201383.2) 0.5038 CKD\u2013EPICysC (mL/min/1.73 m2) 65.8 (59.7\u201380.4) 80.8 (60.0\u2013106. PENK showed no statistical superiority over eGFR based on CysC (P=0.473) NGAL was inferior to all eGFR equations (all P0.05) PENK and NGAL concentrations were significantly higher in patients with RRT than in patients without RRT. distribution and agreement of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) categories varied across each eGFR equation. proportion of reduced GFR (60 mL/min/1.73 m2) was highest based on CKD-EPICysC equation. lowest based on CKD-EPICr equation (58.7% vs 44.9%, P0.0001, Chi-square test) median concentration of NGAL was below the 493 ng/mL cut-off that was obtained by the ROC curve analysis. but it was higher than the literature- and manufacturer-recommended 150 ng/mL cut-off in the normal GFR categories. data are expressed as median (interquartile range) 8.6) 0.0001 80 3/72 (4.2) 27/95 (28.4) 7.9 (3.9\u201316.2) 0.0001 NGAL (ng/mL) 548.5 [253.0\u2013985.0] 407 [210.8\u2013914.0] 0.4014 493 14/87 (16.1) 16/80 (20.0) 1.4 (0.7\u20132.9) 0.3551 150 4/26 (15.4) 26/141 (18.4) 1.4 (0.5\u20133.5) 0.5746 MDRD Study (m PENK concentration, NGAL concentration, and eGFRs all showed significant differences according to sepsis severity. both PENK and NGAL concentrations increased significantly, while all eGFRs decreased significantly according to sepsis severity. CKD-EPICr and CKD-EPICr-CysC showed significant differences between patients with and without AKI only in the sepsis stage. CKD-EPICr and CKD-EPICr-CysC indicated normal kidney function (GFR60 mL/min/1.73 m2) in septic patients without AKI. septic shock is a subset of sepsis characterized by a state of acute circulatory failure associated with infection. renal biomarkers increased and the four eGFR equations decreased in the septic shock stage, even in patients without AKI. increased PENK concentration in the septic shock stage can be explained by both renal and cardiac dysfunction. PENK may reflect GFR better than NGAL and may not be influenced by inflammation. eGFRs based on four equations showed significant differences between survivors and non-survivors. NGAL and other biomarkers include interleukin 8 and kidney injury molecule-1. this is the first study to demonstrate the usefulness of PENK in comparison with NGAL and eGFR equations."}
