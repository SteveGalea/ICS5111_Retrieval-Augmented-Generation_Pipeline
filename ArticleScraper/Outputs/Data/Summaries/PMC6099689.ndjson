{"summary": "RT inhibitors include a variety of nucleoside and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs and NNRTIs) that inhibit the conversion of single-stranded viral RNA into double-stranded pro-viral DNA in the HIV-1 infection process. Xie and colleagues have identified two classes of novel HIV-1 NNRTIs, diarylanilines (DAANs) and diarylpyridines (DAPAs) with extremely high anti new tab Chemical Structure of the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) azidothymidine (AZT) and five non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) including Nevirapine (NVP), Etravirine (TMC125), diarylanilines (DAANs)-15 h, DAAN-14 h, and diarylpyridines (DAPA)-2e. all NNRTI/AZT combinations 94US_33931N (R5) 0.364 70.50 8.42 8.38 34.47 8.42 4.10 94US_33931N (R5) 0.652 11.51 4.23 2.72 148.91 42.32 3.52 93IN101 (C, R5) 0.089 34.24 0.29 116.19 730.12 58.95 12.39 964 (R5/X4) 0.003 3.35 0.01 460.00 15,178.32 7.28 2083 HIV-1 Strains (Tropism) CI DAAN-15h AZT IC50 (nM) Dose Reduction (Fold) IC50 (nM) Dose Reduction (Fold) Alone in Mixture Alone in Mixture IIIB (X4) 0.071 3.98 0.09 44.22 39.31 1.86 21.13 Bal (R5) 0.852 5.36 0.52 10.31 34.47 26.02 1.32 94US_339 CI NVP AZT IC50 (nM) Dose Reduction (Fold) IC50 (nM) Dose Reduction (Fold) Alone in Mixture Alone in Mixture IIIB (X4) 0.199 11.74 1.47 8.01 39.31 2.93 13.41 Bal (R5) 0.892 307.91 50.25 6.13 34.47 25.12 1.37 94US_33931N (R5) 0.316 24.15 2.91 8.28 AZT and DAAN-14h exhibited stronger synergism against the two resistant strains than the combination of AZT with AZT with TMC125 or NVP. the CI values for combinations of AZT with new NNRTIs against AZT-resistant strains 964 and 629 were in the range of 0.003\u20130.040 and 0.109\u20130.237. the new NNRTIs under development, DAPA-2e, DAAN-14h, and DAAN-15h, possess improved antiviral activity against HIV-1 strains, particularly those resistant to NRTIs and NNRTIs. these new NNRTIs can be further developed as new additions to the anti-HIV drug arsenal. icacy and safety of these NNRTI/NRTI combinations are warranted. combinations of these investigationsal NNRTIs with the modern, preferred NRTIs such as tenofovir (TDF/TAF) should also be tested in the future. IC50 values of DAPA-2e and AZT (NRTI) for inhibiting HIV-1 IIIB infection are 99.21 and 39.31 nM, respectively. the ratio for DAPA-2e:AZT in the combination is 2.5 (=99.21/39.31), to make the concentrations of the NNRTI and NRTI in the combination with equal potency. s cells expressing CD4 and coreceptors CXCR4 and CCR5 were infected with a HIV-1 strain at 100 TCID50 (50% tissue culture infective dose) culture supernatants were collected to test for p24 antigen by ELISA as previously described. the ratio of NNRTI (DAAN or DAPA) to NRTI (AZT) in these combinations was determined based on their IC50 values when tested alone. edward et al."}
