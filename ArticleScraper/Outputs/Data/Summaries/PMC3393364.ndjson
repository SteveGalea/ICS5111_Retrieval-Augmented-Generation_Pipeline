{"summary": "epidemiological and virological studies have identified several risk factors for severe influenza virus infection. host factors such as extremes of age, comorbid illness, pregnancy, and obesity (22, 24, 38) and viral factors such as specific virus strains, including the 1918 H1N1 virus and the A(H5N1) virus subtype (50) a split-virion inactivated A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine was used as the coating antigen in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and avidity assay. compared the quality of the antibodies from severe and mild cases by using antibody avidity assays. each 0.5-ml dose of the vaccine contains 15 g of HA. the same batch of the vaccine was used for all experiments. ELISA method was modified slightly from our published protocols (16, 48) the sera were added at a dilution with an expected absorbance of 1.0 0.2. urea concentrations of >4 M always markedly reduced the OD value even if the urea was added, incubated, and washed before the reaction with the sera. the avidity index was defined as the ratio of the urea to the OD without urea (26). the ratio of ELISA and MN antibody titers (ELISA/MN titer ratio) was used as an estimate of the quantity of nonneutralizing antibody. correlations between the ELISA and MN titers were assessed. ninety-six-well immunoplates were coated with 100 l of the vaccine at 2 g HA/ml in 0.05 M NaHCO3 (pH 9.6) overnight at 4\u00b0C and then blocked with 1% normal goat serum at 300 l/well at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. after 3 washes, 100 l of PBS was added to each well and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. urea concentrations of >4 M always markedly reduced the OD value even if the urea was added, incubated, and washed before the reaction with the sera. this suggested that such a high urea concentration can cause a falsely low reading by removing the coated vaccine antigen. correlations between ELISA and MN titers were assessed by Spearman's rank correlation coefficient test. a total of 52 patients were included in this study, with a median age of 49.5 years and an age range of 21 to 86 years. the ELISA GMT was 3.1 times higher for patients with severe disease than for those with mild disease (P = 0.004) the median neutralizing antibody titer determined by MN assay was higher for patients with severe disease than for those with mild disease. the antibody avidity index was significantly higher for patients with severe disease than for those with mild disease (P = 0.011) the difference between the groups is significant (Mann-Whitney U test; P = 0.011). the difference between the groups is significant (Mann-Whitney U test; P = 0.045). antibody titers determined by MN and HI assays usually have good correlation with recent A(H1N1)pdm09 infection (15) neutralizing antibody titers of 40 or more are associated with protection from influenza virus infection and are often used as markers of successful immunization in influenza vaccine trials. ic antibody response against conserved epitopes can occur within a few days after infection because of immune priming by previous exposure to similar viral epitopes. a delay in viral clearance rather than a high initial viral load in the respiratory tract is associated with severe disease. nonneutralizing antibodies with high avidity could produce more damage to patients than antibodies with low avidity. anti-inflammatory effects of nonneutralizing antibody in pathogenesis and outcome of influenza should be investigated further (3). antibody avidity is higher in older than in younger vaccine recipients. a split-virion influenza vaccine contains HA and other viral proteins. a sampling bias may have occurred in the severe cases, because for those who died early on, no sera could be collected. we did not test the antibody titers in serum samples collected on day 0 and day 1 after symptom onset. the exact quantity of each protein present in our batch of the vaccine was not known. the high ELISA titers may have been related to antibodies that could neutralize the virus in vivo. anatomical site where viral load cannot be controlled by the initial innate immune response, concomitant innate inflammatory response and adaptive immune response with nonneutralizing cross-reactive antibody may just fuel inflammatory damage. inflammatory cytokines spilled over into the circulation may precipitate acute catastrophes such as stroke or heart attack (46)."}
