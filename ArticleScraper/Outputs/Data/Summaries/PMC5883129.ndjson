{"summary": "the immune system is mediated by pathogen-recognition receptors. the inflammatory response is one of the important performances of lots of diseases. the development of inflammation is mutually affected with damaged DNA. the inflammation system Inflammation is a defensive response to stimuli. in inflammatory process, tissue and cells are damaged by injury factors. in addition, damaged tissue is repaired and healed by substrate and interstitial regenerated cells. an E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme, an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme and an E3 ubiquitin ligase to attach the substrate proteins. the downstream of all ubiquitination reactions are regulated by E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme in human body. the E2 enzyme plays a central role in regulating ubiquitin chain assembly. it controls the length of ubiquitin chain and the type of connection. E3 ligases can be categorized into two groups, RING type and HECT type. K48-linked polyubiquitin chain (Lys48) and K63-linked polyubiquitin chain (Lys63) play an important role in regulating activity process of NF-B pathway. lack of K48-linked polyubiquitin chains account for death of cells [34] K63-linked polyubiquitination modulates nonproteolytic functions, including protein trafficking, kinase activation and phosphatase activation. the signaling molecules of K63-linked polyubiquitination play an important role in signal transduction including NF-B, T-cell receptor, toll-like receptor, RIG- I-like receptor, NOD-like receptor and Akt activation. the first line of defense to resist invading pathogens is mediated by pathogen-recognition receptors. inflammation is caused by series of interactions between genetic factors, the environment, the abnormal intestinal microbial immune response and other factors. ubiquitination has emerged as an essential role in signal transduction of inflammation, including TLRs, NLRs and RLRs. associated kinase (IRAK)-4, a serine kinase with a N-terminal death domain, interacts with MyD88 to activate other IRAK family members such as IRAK-1 and IRAK-2. TNFR-associated factor 6 acts as an E3 ubiquitin protein ligase. the complex of TGF-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) is activated by K63-linked poly-ubiquitin chains K63-ub from RIP1 and TRAF6 Inhibit TNF- induced NF-B signaling [68,69] OTULIN DUBs Inhibit the production of M1-ub Inhibit TNF- induced NF-B signaling [72] TLR Ubc13/uev1A RING E3 ligase Transfer of K63 on RIP2 Inhibit NF-B signaling [45] NOD1/2 RIP2 D2-mediated signaling, NALP3 protein promotes K63-linked polyubiquitination of RIP2. kinase activation stimulated the expression of inflammatory cytokines. NLRs typically include several leucine-rich repeats at the C termini. RIP2, TRAF6 and NEMO are the target proteins of K63 polyubiquitination. the sites of RIP2 and NEMO ubiquitination are important for activating IKK by NODs. RIP2 polyubiquitination promotes the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. lack of TRAF3 RING domain protein caused abnormal induction of type 1 interferons, suggesting that its E3 activity was important for activating TBK1 [80]. multiple TRAF proteins, including TRAF2, TRAF3, and TRAF6, bind to MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral signaling) to activate IKK and TAK1. however, K63-linked chains were removed by DUB cylindromatosis. CYLD removed the K63 polyubiquitin chains from a range of NF-B signaling proteins. CYLD-deficient mice showed a myriad of phenotypes, suggesting that CYLD has a key role in deubiquitinating several NF-B signaling proteins. a new DUB has shown that TRAF3, detached from K63 polyubiquitination, inhibits the activation of TBK1 [95] there are many other DUB operators inhibiting the function of NF-B pathway. the inflammation system Inflammation is a defensive response to stimuli. ubiquitin system Ubiquitin (UB) is a highly conserved small protein with a molecular mass of 8.5 kDa, containing 76 amino-acid residues. the ubiquitin molecule consists of seven lysine sites (K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, K48 and K63) K63- and K48-mediated polyubiquitination play an important role in a large number of biological and pathological functions. central role of ubiquitin enzymes in ubiquitination Attachment of UB to proteins is catalyzed by Ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1, Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 and Ubiquitin ligase E3. E3 ligases containing HECT domains catalytically activate themselves and transfer ubiquitin from E2 to their cysteine for directly connecting substrate protein. Depending on the relative ratio of E3 enzymes to target protein, the monoubiquitination and multi-monoubiquitination of target proteins can be identified [25-27]. K48-linked polyubiquitination regulates the stability of protein through negative feedback adjustment. lack of K48-linked polyubiquitin chains account for the death of cells. TRAF6 (TNF receptor-associated factor 6), an RING domain protein, plays a significant role in the activation of IKK by interleukin-1 (IL-1) and TLR pathways. TRAF6 catalyzes target proteins of K63-linked poly-ubiquitination including TRAF6 and NEMO themselves. the activated TAK1 phosphorylates IKKb and then enables downstream activation of NF-B signal pathway. TLR4 is the only TLR that uses all four adaptors. IL-1R-associated kinase (TRAF-6) acts as an E3 ubiquitin protein ligase. TNFR-associated factor 6 acts as an E3 ubiquitin protein ligase. kinase 1 (TAK1) is activated by K63-linked poly-ubiquitin chains. the IKK complex also bind the K63-linked poly-ubiquitin chains. the freed NF-B is translocated into the nucleus and activates pro-inflammation cytokine genes. DUBA DUBs remove K63-ub from RIP2 Inhibit NF-B signaling [64,65] RIG-I TRAF3/TAK1 - Prevent interaction between TRAF3 and TBK1 Inhibit NF-B signaling [71] Ubiquitination plays a central role in the activation of NEMO and IB. NLRP3 inflammasome priming plays an important role in regulating ubiquitin. mutations of NOD2 and NOD1 induce transcriptional upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and activate NF-B via an adaptor, RIP2/RICK. RIP2, TRAF6 and NEMO ubiquitination are important for activating IKK. linear polyubiquitination of RIP2 promotes the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. formation of RIG-I is known to be modulated by ubiquitination. bind between RIG-I and MAVS was abrogated. ination of RIG-I caused negative regulation of RLR signal by linear ubiquitination. NF-B activation plays an important role in regulating homeostatic NF-B activation. NF-B pathway stimulated the IKK complex activation. mice deficient of A20 are likely to have inflammation in multiple organs and defective cells. DUB activity of A20 removes K63 polyubiquitin chains from RIP1 and TRAF-6 which accordingly inhibits NF-B function. OTULIN regulates activation of LUBAC and LUBAC-mediated NF-B. lack of OTULIN leads to inhibit the TNF-induced activation of NF-B and expression of pro-inflammatory gene. ubiquitination plays an important role in many diseases and physiological processes. the study is important for human beings to explain the mechanism of inflammation. the study is important for human beings to explain the mechanism of inflammation."}
