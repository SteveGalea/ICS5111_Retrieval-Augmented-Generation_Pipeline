{"summary": "cases of possible SARS reported to the CDHS were classified as suspect, probable, or laboratory-confirmed. extensive diagnostic testing was performed at the CDHS Viral and Rickettsial Disease Laboratory on specimens from 165 patients. s, 5 endotracheal aspirates, 39 single acute-phase serum specimens and 39 acute- and convalescent-phase paired serum specimens were collected at least 28 days after symptom onset. total nucleic acid was extracted from all respiratory specimens for reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR. specimens from 151 patients were suitable for molecular testing. in 63 (42%) of these, RT-PCR detected a respiratory pathogen. no patient had more than one agent identified by molecular methods. bMeasured as a significant rise in immunoglobulin (Ig) G in paired serum samples for all specimens except one positive for M. pneumoniae IgM. cSpecimens from one case-patient negative by culture and PCR. serologic testing was performed on specimens from 78 patients. no respiratory specimens were positive for SARS-CoV by RT-PCR. serologic tests of samples from two patients showed rises in IgG to multiple antigens, consistent with a nonspecific immune response. HMPV, whose role in SARS-CoV infection remains undefined, was detected by PCR in four patients with suspect SARS and 2 patients with probable SARS. bIncludes polymerase chain reaction (PCR), culture, and serologic. cOne patient had evidence of co-infection with both influenza A (PCR and culture) and M. pneumoniae (immunoglobulin [Ig] M detection) dSARS-CoV, SARS-associated coronavirus. more than one-third had a pathogen detected that was considered a likely cause of their condition based on their clinical features and course of illness. exclusion criteria may need to be reevaluated and applied with particular caution. the limitations of molecular testing include the possibility of false-positive results. detecting an agent by PCR does not always indicate the true cause of infection."}
