APN is the first toxin receptor protein that plays a role in the mechanism of the Bt toxin [16]. Knight et al. and Gill et al. [29] cloned a 120-kD receptor-related protein gene. binding experiments showed that APN is the receptor of Lymantria dispar, Plutella xylostella and Trichoplusia ni combined with Cry1Ac. periplocoside E-semi-succinic acid ester was synthesized and identified by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. periplocoside E-semi-succinic acid ester contains four more lines than periplcoside E. periplocoside E (A) and periplocoside E-semi-succinic acid ester (B) are two methylene carbon atoms. periplocoside E (A) and periplocoside E-semi-succinic acid ester (B) are two methylene carbon atoms. binding proteins of periplocoside E from M. separata midgut recognized by affinity chromatography. luciferin 4-monooxygenase, aminopeptidase N, aminopeptidase N3, NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 gi|520836887 78123. periplocosides may disrupt microvilli on the epithelial cells of the midgut of insects by interacting with proteins on the microvillar membrane or those associated with the membrane. periplocosides may have the same target protein as that of the Bt toxin and celangulins. aminopeptidase-N (APN) is an exopeptidase that is abundant in the BBMVs of many lepidopteran and dipteran insects. APN catalyzes the removal of N-terminal neutral amino acids. most studied and reported aspect of APN is the Bt toxin. eight potential binding proteins of periplocoside E were isolated from the midguts of M. separata larvae through affinity chromatography. these proteins include luciferin 4-monooxygenase, aminopeptidase N, NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate 3-phosphatase myotubularin, actin. the functions of some of the important proteins linked to the symptoms caused by periplocosides were also analyzed. we speculate that aminopeptidase N (APN) is the putative target protein of periplocosides. further studies are needed to verify the accuracy of this assumption. periplocoside E-semi-succinic acid ester was synthesized using periplocoside E and succinic anhydride. 100 mg of periplocoside E (0.08 mmol) and 100 mg of succinic anhydride (1 mmol) were placed in a reaction vessel and dissolved in 20 mL of anhydrous pyridine. 20 mL of methanol was added to terminate the completed reaction. the matrix was subjected to sedimentation using 80 mL of 0.5 mol/L NaCl. periplocoside E-semi-succinic acid ester (ligand) was dissolved in the coupling solution (50% ethylene glycol solution) and added to the matrix. the superfluous medium was eluted with three cycles of an alternating pH elution buffer. 8.0 containing 0.5 mol/L NaCl and low pH (0.1 mol/L acetic acid/ sodium acetate, pH4.0 containing 0.5 mol/L NaCl) buffer solution. 4.7. SDS-PAGE and LC/Q-TOF-MS analysis. the fifth instar larvae of M. separata Walker were starved for 12 h before the experiment. the midguts were then dissected; the midguts were then dissected. the remaining tissues were washed in an ice-cold 0.7% NaCl solution. epoxy amino hexyl (EAH)-activated sepharose 4B was prepared according to the operation manual. the medium was sufficiently swelled in 100 mL of 20% ethanol. when the medium swelled, the ethanol solution was decanted and the required amount of the matrix was washed five times on a glass filter. for competitive elution, periplocoside E was dissolved in the binding buffer. the affinity medium was then washed with an alternating high pH (0.1 mol/L Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 containing 0.5 mol/L NaCl) and low pH (0.1 mol/L acetic acid/ sodium acetate, pH4.0 containing 0.5 mol/L NaCl) to regenerate the medium."}
