{"summary": "the virus causes vomiting and wasting disease (VWD) and/or encephalomyelitis in suckling piglets. the virus was first isolated from the brains of suckling pigs with encephalomyelitis in 1962. mortality rate of PHEV-infected piglets under 3 weeks of age is almost 100%. studies on microRNA:mRNA interactions networks have uncovered a notable role of the microRNA system in the pathogenesis of RNA viruses. many viruses exploit their host pathways by destroying, boosting, or hijacking microRNAs to benefit the viral life cycle. equine encephalitis virus adapts to use antiviral properties of vertebrate miR-142-3p to limit replication in particular cell types. the upregulation of miR-142-5p (Accession number: MIMAT0000154) severely stunted neuronal morphogenesis during PHEV infection by targeting the unc-51-like-kinase1 (Ulk1, NCBI Reference Sequence: NM_009469.3) mRNA 3\u2032 untranslated region (3\u2032UTR), suggesting that PHEV largely exploited spatiotemporal control of host microRNAs for neurological disorders. further characterization inoculated mice were anesthetized with 3.5% chloral hydrate (1.0 mL/100 g; Sigma, USA) and 10 nmoL miR-142-5p antagomirs were then positioned in the cerebral cortex with a stereotaxic apparatus. mice were sacrificed at various timepoints, and the cerebral cortices of PHEV- or control-infected mice were dissected for the following study. nM miR-142-5p mimics or 50200 nM inhibitors were transfected into neurons using X-tremeGENE HP DNA Transfection Reagent (Roche, Sweden) oligonucleotides were designed as follows: anti-sense primer, 3\u2032 GTAUUUCAUCUUUCGUGAUGA5\u2032; anti-sense primer, 3\u2032 GTAUUUCAUCUUUCGUGAUGA5\u2032. the quantitative RT-PCR reaction conditions: pre-degeneration at 95\u00b0C for 3 min, denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 60\u00b0C for 30 s, extension at 72\u00b0C for 30 s. the membranes were blocked overnight at 4\u00b0C with 5% non-fat dry milk in PBS and immunoblotted with antibodies against Ulk1 (Cell Signaling Technologies, USA, 1:1,000), -actin (Proteintech, USA XP\u00ae rabbit mAb (Cell Signaling Technologies, USA), ULK1 (D8H5) rabbit mAb, and/or PHEV mouse mAb were applied for 1 h at room temperature. coverslips were mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade Reagent (Life Technologies), and the slides were observed under a confocal microscope. ization with digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled mRNA probes or biotin-labeled microRNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probes (EXONBIO, Guangzhou, China) was performed at 42\u00b0C overnight. the slides were examined under a fluorescence microscope.

Western blotting Primary cortical neuron lysate or freshly isolated cerebral cortex lysate was diluted in RIPA lysis buffer on ice. then, the membranes were blocked overnight at 4\u00b0C with 5% non-fat dry milk in rabbit mAb, and/or PHEV mouse mAb applied for 1 h at room temperature. coverslips mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade Reagent (Life Technologies) slides were viewed under a confocal microscope. in-labeled microRNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probes were performed at 42\u00b0C overnight. a blocking reagent was applied, followed by incubation with an anti-DIG or rhodamine-conjugated anti-biotin antibody. the slides were examined under a fluorescence microscope with a proper filter set.

RNA interference Neurons were transfected with 20, 50, and 100 n a microRNA array was performed to identify the microRNAs involved in neurological dysfunction as a result of PHEV infection. miR-142-5p expression was time-dependently upregulated in response to PHEV infection in mice (Figure 1A), consistent with the microarray analysis. miR-142-5p localization occurred in a punctuate pattern along the axon shaft and within dendrite protrusions. signal intensities confirmed significantly higher levels of the miR-142-5p in PHEV-infected neurons. co-localization of miR-142-5p and PHEV within neurites suggested a possible functional role for this microRNA in PHEV-induced nerve cell injury. miR-142-5p inhibitors restricted PHEV replication in vitro. microRNA mimics were transfected into primary cortical neurons. miR-142-5p function was suppressed by transfecting a microRNA inhibitor. miR-142-5p mimics were not effective in restricting PHEV replication in neurons. miR-142-5p inhibitors (200 nM) significantly decreased viral replication at 72 h post-infection (hpi) miR-142-5p acted as a negative regulator of axon elongation in cortical neurons. it was involved in regulation of axon development and/or functional responses to PHEV. qRT-PCR and Western blotting analysis showed that Ulk1 expression levels were all down-regulated reciprocally with miR-142-5p in the primary cortical neurons after PHEV treatment. qRT-PCR and Western blotting analysis showed that Ulk1 expression levels were all down-regulated reciprocally with miR-142-5p. miR-142-5p inhibited translation of the luciferase mRNA. the effect of miR-142-5p on translation of the mRNA was dependent on the presence of the miR-21a-5p cognate binding site within the 3\u2032UTR. analysis of Ulk1 expression in lysates from miR-142-5p mimics transfected primary cortical neurons showed a dose-dependent decrease in the level of endogenous Ulk1 protein. further investigation determined that Ulk1 level was inhibited in vivo after the miR-142-5p antagomir was injected into the brains of mice with a stereotaxic apparatus. data represent means from three independent experimentsSD, Paired Student's t-test, *P 0.05, **P 0.01. Ulk1 functions in axonal growth and morphogenesis. it is possible that Ulk1 is involved in axonal growth and morphogenesis. RNAi-expressing primary cortical neurons were transfected with siRNA at a concentration of 20, 50, and 100 nM. the cells were harvested for analysis of Western blot, and results revealed that 100 nM siRNA effectively knocked down Ulk1 protein expression in primary cortical neurons. co-expression of miR-142-5p and Ulk1 was found in the neurite shifts and/or growth cones with a prominent signal in primary neurons. we found that miR-142-5p inhibitors efficiently rescued the shortened axon elongations caused by loss function of Ulk1. fected with inhibitors did not have restricted axon elongation. n = 50 cells per condition counted in triplicate s.d. inhibition of Ulk1 blocks normal dendrites formation. primary cortical neurons were incubated with designated constructs or PHEV. at 16 DIV, neurons were stained with antibodies against MAP2 (green) or PHEV (red) miR-142-5p antagomir treatment significantly induced ulk1 protein expression in PHEV-infected or healthy mice at 6 dpi. survival times of the antagomir-treated mice were significantly extended compared to PHEV-infected or control-treated mice. qRT-PCR of PHEV mRNA showed viral replication clearly blocked in the antagomir-treated mice. upper panels show the mice incubated with PHEV alone. lower panels represent the healthy mice. we used an in situ hybridization protocol to examine the localization of miR-142-5p RNA and found widespread expression of microRNAs in the cerebral cortexes of the mice. ISH analysis in primary cortical neurons showed miR-142-5p localization occurred in a punctuate pattern along the axon shaft and within dendrite protrusions. -142-5p (red) was up-regulated by PHEV. y-axis is the average miR-142-5p intensity using arbitrary fluorescence unit (AFU), **P 0.01. miR-142-5p inhibitors restricted PHEV replication. neurons were cultured for a total of 10 days (10DIV), transfected at 7 DIV, PHEV-infected at 8 DIV, and then cultured for 48 h in vitro. miR-142-5p mimics (100 nM) were not effective in restricting PHEV replication in neurons. miR-142-5p acted as a negative regulator of axon elongation in cortical neurons. it was involved in regulation of axon development and/or functional responses to PHEV. PHEV-infected neurons grew significantly shortened axons. 142-5p regulates axon morphology during PHEV infection. potential targets of miR-142-5p were predicted using microRNA target prediction databases. we focused on 10 genes that we recently identified in a screen for mRNAs in which translation was reduced in neurons upon PHEV treatment. miR-142-5p inhibited translation of the luciferase mRNA 3\u2032UTR. the effect of miR-142-5p on translation of the luciferase mRNA was dependent on the presence of the miR-142-5p cognate binding site within the 3\u2032UTR. lysates from miR-142-5p mimics transfected primary cortical neurons showed a dose-dependent decrease in the level of endogenous Ulk1 protein, whereas delivery of its inhibitor led to an increase in protein expression. further investigation determined that Ulk1 level was inhibited in vivo after the miR-142-5p antagomir was injected into the brains of mice. Western blotting analysis of Ulk1 expression in lysates from primary cortical neurons transfected with miR-142-5p mimics/inhibitors. data represent means from three independent experimentsSD, Paired Student's t-test, *P 0.05, **P 0.01. the control neurons mostly grew in a normal mode with a main axon that extended over a long distance. our data indicated that Ulk1 played a key role in neuronal morphogenesis and the dysfunctional Ulk1 disturbed axonal elongation in primary cortical neurons. x-axis represents the length of the axons grouped into five columns. miR-142-5p-mediated Ulk1 repression controls axon elongation underlying PHEV infection. we further explored the basic mechanisms underlying the axon morphology changes caused by PHEV infection. antibody straining showed infected neurons transfected with miR-142-5p inhibitors did not have restricted axon elongation. data represent the means of n = 50 cells per condition counted in triplicate s.d. morphology was similar to the spines seen in PHEV-infected neurons. however, the phenotype was opposite in the overexpression group. miR-142-5p antagomirs are a class of chemically engineered and modified oligonucleotides that prevent other molecules from binding to a desired site on an mRNA molecule. the effectiveness and specificity of the antagomir in inhibiting endogenous miR-142-5p expression and enhancing Ulk1 expression has been demonstrated in mice. qRT-PCR showed that endogenous miR-142-5p was specially inhibited by antagomirs, and that Ulk1 expression was significantly enhanced after miR-142-5p treatment. n = 10 mice per group for three independent experiments. miR-122 exhibited a miRNA \u201csponge\u201d effect and was sequestered by HVS-infected T cells for long-term oncogenic potential. PHEV has a strong tropism for the CNS, where nerve cells but not glial cells are targets for viral replication. some microRNAs have been reported to play crucial roles in CNS development. miR-122 antagonism has been in phase II clinical studies as an HCV therapy. we presume that miR-142-5p antagonism is a potential novel strategy for PHEV therapeutic. but the incompletely abolished viral replication indicated there are other regulatory events in the physiological context of infection. the abundance of miR-142-5p and Ulk1 could repress Ulk1 mRNA, resulting in limited synthesis of new Ulk1 protein and restricted neuronal morphogenesis in underlying PHEV infection. post-transcriptional regulation of virus-induced host microRNAs significantly contributed to CNS dysfunction, which suggested that the combination of multiple microRNAs may have had therapeutic potential. further work is needed to obtain insights into the fate of the Ulk1-mediated pathway processes in regulating diverse downstream signaling events during PHEV infection. authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
