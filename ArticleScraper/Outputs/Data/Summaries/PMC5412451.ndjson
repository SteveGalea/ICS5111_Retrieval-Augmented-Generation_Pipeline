{"summary": "lactoferrin is a highly glycosylated protein that was first isolated from bovine milk in 1939. it has been identified in secretions from exocrine glands as well as in specific granules of neutrophils. it is present in large amounts in milk, and in mammalian exocrine secretions such as saliva, tears, mucus, white blood cells and seminal fluid. toferrin has been produced from various microorganisms, transgenic animals (cows, goats) and recombinant plants. bovine lactoferrin (bLF) is used to supplement food products such as cakes, pastries, yogurts, and drinks. an appropriate design of infant formula requires the addition of lactoferrin that mimics the properties of human milk lactoferrin. iron-binding sites exist on each lobe in lactoferrin- with two domains. lactoferrin is the only transferrin capable of retaining Fe3+ ions in a wide range of pH values. abnormal composition decreases the resistance of lactoferrins to proteolysis. apolactoferrin was denatured faster than halolactoferrin. apolactoferrin was denatured faster than halolactoferrin. lactoferrin reduces the growth of a wide variety of microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, viruses, and protozoa. the ability to bind iron, at even at low pHs, prevents bacterial proliferation. glycan compositions 4Hex-3HexNAc-1Fuc, 3Hex-5HexNAc, 5Hex-2HexNAc-1NeuAc, 5Hex-4HexNAc-1NeuAc, and 5Hex-3HexNAc-1NeuAc preferentially used as substrates by B. infantis. lactoferrin plays important roles in immune host defense by supporting proliferation, differentiation, and activation of immune system cells. iron-saturated forms of rhLF and hLF have similar crystal structures. rhLF has iron-binding and iron-releasing properties equivalent to those of hLF. some studies found that rhLF is more sensitive to proteolysis than hLF. rhLf may present some glycan patterns that are typical of bovine milk glycome. the bioactivity of rhLf was tested on animals\u2019 models [47], including pigs [48] and neonatal mice [49]. N-glycan core is composed of two GlcNAc and three mannoses. the glycan core is assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum of the cell. the glycan is elongated with other monosaccharides via the action of enzymes. lactoferrin amino acid sequences have been reported for many species, including human, cow, horse, goat, pig, mouse, sheep, buffalo, camel, zebu, and gorilla. the protein contains nearly 690\u2013711 residues, with a degree of homology ranging from 65 to nearly 100% among species. despite the identical amino acid sequence, the profile of the human lactoferrin recombinantly expressed in cows was closer in glycosidation to bovine milk lactoferrin than to the human counterpart. differences are indicative of a strong organism-dependent influence on lactoferrin post-translational modifications. the contribution of N-glycans to the biological function of lactoferrin is not known. a recent study reveals that N-glycans released from lactoferrin are involved in the inhibition of P. aeruginosa, bacteria responsible for bacterial keratitis and invasion of corneal epithelial cells. the role of glycosylation in protein functions has not been elucidated. endo--N-acetylglucosaminidase (EndoBI-1) isolated from Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis ATCC 15697 cleaves the N,N\u2032-diacetylchitobiose moiety at the N-glycan core. it does not require substrate denaturation, enabling glycans in native form to be produced, so that their biological functions can be investigated using native state proteins a glycan-HPLC-chip is composed of an enrichment column and a separation column packed with porous graphitized carbon. the separation column separates molecules based on their interaction with the stationary phase. the nanospray tip produces a spray of protonated ions for MS analysis. microfluidic chip with nano ESI is usually coupled to a high-accuracy quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) mass analyzer. the ions enter into the mass analyzer where they are accelerated by an electric field, and travel towards the detector as a function of their mass to-charge ratio. the detector counts the ions and translates the ionic energy in electrical energy. N-glycans can initially be identified from the mass spectra. MS/MS analysis generates specific fragment ions common to all N-glycans. each spectrum can be screened for the presence of fragment ions. the carbon enrichment column accomplishes a refined miniaturized purification of a sample by trapping only the molecules of interest. a pump moves the sample solution with the liquid mobile phase in the graphitized carbon column that binds the N-glycans. the nanospray tip produces a spray of protonated ions. detector counts the ions and translates the ionic energy in electrical energy. signals are generated and recorded by a computer system that produces a mass spectrum showing the relative abundance of the detected compounds according to their m/z. glycans can be rapidly analyzed in a high-throughput and reproducible manner. deconvoluted MS/MS spectrum of a neutral lactoferrin N-glycan 5Hex-2HexNAc. green circles represent mannose and HexNAc respectively. many products are already on the market, or under development."}
