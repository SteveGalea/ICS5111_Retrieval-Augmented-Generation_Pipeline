{"summary": "chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is currently ranked the 4th leading cause of death worldwide by the world health organization. the main risk factor of COPD is exposure to tobacco smoke which triggers a cascade of inflammatory pathways leading to disease induction in susceptible people. the most common viral pathogen in exacerbated patients is rhinovirus, followed by influenza virus, RSV and coronavirus. a promising candidate for therapeutic inhibition of IL-1 signaling is one of its inhibitors, the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) anakinra. IL-1 driven neutrophilia was mediated by IL-17A in the initial phase of viral infection. treatment with the IL-1Ra, anakinra, proved efficient in reducing neutrophilic inflammation at the peak of viral replication. animal experiments were performed according to institutional guidelines and Swiss federal and cantonal laws on animal protection. Mice C57BL/6 or BALB/c mice were between 8\u201312 weeks of age. mice were exposed intranasally to a mixture of 7 g LPS from E. coli. BALB/c mice with 78 mg/kg Ketamin and 1.93 mg/kg Xylazin were exposed to LPS/elastase once per week for four consecutive weeks. disease severity was determined one week after the last LPS/elastase challenge. mice were anesthetized by intramuscular injection of 100 mg/kg ketamine (Ketasol-100, Graeub) and intraperitoneal injection of 50 mg/kg pentobarbital (Esconarkon, Streuli Pharma) mice were mechanically ventilated at a rate of 450 breaths/min and a tidal volume of 10 ml/kg bodyweight. antibodies for in vivo studies For neutralization of IL-17A, mice were treated with 250 g of anti-IL-17A (clone 17F3) or the corresponding isotype control antibody (clone MPOC-21) from BioxCell. the clone 17F3 uniquely reacts with the IL-17A and no other IL-17 isoform [33] the following primers were used: GAPDH forward 5\u2032-GGG TGT GAA CCA CGA GAA AT-3\u2032, GAPDH reverse 5\u2032-CCT TCC ACA ATG CCA AAG TT-3\u2032; CXCL1 forward 5\u2032-GCC TAT CGC CAA TGA GCT G-3\u2032; CXCL1 reverse 5\u2032-ATT CTT GAG TGT GGC TAT GA-3\u2032; CXCL2 forward 5\u2032-AGT GAA cytokine levels whole lung and trachea were collected and stored in protease inhibitor solution (Roche) at 20\u00b0C until use. IL-1 protein was determined using the mouse IL-1 ELISA kit Ready-SET-Go! from eBioscience. LPS/elastase Exposure and Viral Infection Mice were exposed intranasally to a mixture of 7 g LPS from E. coli O26:B6 (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1.2 U porcine pancreatic elastase (EPC) in a total volume of 100 l, and treated once per week for four consecutive weeks. two weeks after the last LPS/elastase challenge, mice were infected histology and Quantification of Damage Lungs were inflated with 1 ml 10% formalin, embedded into paraffin and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. slides were analyzed by light microscopy. newtrophils and monocytes in lung and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid distinguished by staining with CD11c APC-Cy7, CD11b PerCP-Cy5.5, Ly-6G Biotin, Ly-6C Pacific Blue, Streptavidin PE-Cy7. cells from lung digests were stimulated with 107 M PMA, 1 g/ml Ionomycin and 2106 M Monensin. mice received 200 g of the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) anakinra (Kineret, Amgen) twice daily. control mice received only PBS. quantitative real-time PCR was performed according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. cytokine levels whole lung and trachea were collected and stored in protease inhibitor solution at 20\u00b0C until use. IL-6 and TNF were measured in a sandwich ELISA using 2.5 g/ml biotin labeled anti-mouse. IL-6 or anti-TNF antibody was developed using substrate p-Nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma-Aldrich) and subsequent incubation with alkaline phosphatase conjugated streptavidin (Biolegend) OD was measured using an ELISA reader (Biotek) both, emphysema and inflammation, remained above baseline levels for at least 2 months. the response induced by repeated challenges with LPS/elastase resembled the pathology of COPD. all experiments performed in wild type mice were conducted in mice. control mice (indicated as day 0 in the following) were pre-exposed to LPS/elastase as were their infected counterparts, but challenged only with PBS instead of influenza virus. expression of influenza matrix protein was normalized to GAPDH. peak of neutrophilic inflammation was reached at day 5 post infection. increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF peaking at day 3 or 5 post infection. inflammatory changes induced by influenza infection had no impact on lung compliance. IL-1 protein in whole lung and trachea of wild type or IL-1 deficient animals was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR and normalized to GAPDH. the proportion of neutrophils in the airways and lung was determined by flow cytometry after restimulation in vitro. pulmonary resistance in IL-1-deficient mice was completely unaffected by the viral challenge. we did not detect any impact of IL-1 on inflammatory monocytes. however, the recruitment of neutrophils to the airways and lung was also significantly abrogated in the absence of IL-1. the peak expression of IL-6 and TNF upon influenza infection was reached faster in C57BL/6 wild type mice at day 1 post infection. IL-6 protein levels followed similar kinetics in both mouse strains. lack of IL-1 did not impair expression and production of IL-6. IL-17A production was significantly reduced in the predominant cellular sources of IL-17A. IL-17A mediated neutrophilic inflammation during influenza-induced exacerbations. IL-17A mediated neutrophilic inflammation during the initial phase of influenza-induced exacerbation. IL-17A mediated neutrophilic inflammation during the initial phase of infection. two representative FACS plots of airway neutrophilia at day 1 after infection are shown as well as the accumulated data. recombinant IL-1Ra (Anakinra) or PBS was administered twice daily, starting two days prior to the viral infection. treatment with Anakinra reduced neutrophil recruitment to the airways at the peak of viral-induced inflammation. IL-1 driven neutrophilia was independent of IL-17A in the first 24 h following viral challenge. IL-1-induced IL-17A caused the recruitment of neutrophils to the airways and lung. at the peak of viral replication, day 5 post infection, neutrophilia became independent of IL-17A. blocking of IL-17A or IL-1 abrogated neutrophilic inflammation in the early phase. both, emphysema and inflammation, remained above baseline levels for at least 2 months. so, the response induced by repeated challenges with LPS/elastase resembled the pathology of COPD. all experiments performed in wild type mice were conducted in BALB/c mice. pulmonary resistance in LPS/elastase pretreated mice revealed a viral-induced acute exacerbation of airway dysfunction. the cells were primarily neutrophils (Figure 2E, Figure S3A) and inflammatory monocytes (Figure 2F, Figure S4A). the peak of neutrophilic inflammation was reached at the peak of neutrophilic inflammation. post infection and neutrophil numbers declined afterwards (Figure 2E, Figure S3A), directly correlating with the kinetics of viral replication. we observed increased expression of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF peaking at day 3 or 5 post infection, respectively, and subsiding at day 7 after the infection. however acute inflammatory changes induced by influenza infection had no impact on the increase in lung compliance. IL-1 protein in whole lung and trachea of wild type or IL-1 deficient animals was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR. the proportion of neutrophils in the airways and lung was determined by flow cytometry. pulmonary resistance in IL-1-deficient mice was completely unaffected by the viral challenge. we did not detect any impact of IL-1 on inflammatory monocytes. however, the recruitment of neutrophils to the airways and lung was also significantly abrogated in the absence of IL-1. the peak expression of IL-6 and TNF upon influenza infection was reached faster in C57BL/6 wild type mice at day 1 post infection (Figure 2G). IL-6 protein levels followed similar kinetics in both mouse strains (Figure S6A,B), while TNF protein production was below the sensitivity limit of our assay. however, lack of IL-1 did not impair expression and production of IL-6. IL-17A mediated neutrophilic inflammation during the initial phase of influenza-induced exacerbation. we neutralized IL-17A during influenza infection of LPS/elastase treated mice. IL-17A neutralization did not impact on the control of viral replication. recombinant IL-1Ra (Anakinra) or PBS was administered twice daily, starting two days prior to the viral infection. recombinant IL-1Ra (Anakinra) or PBS was administered twice daily, starting two days prior to the viral infection. virus was completely cleared at day 9 post infection. treatment with Anakinra reduced neutrophil recruitment to the airways at the peak of viral-induced inflammation. IL-1 driven neutrophilia was independent of IL-17A in the first 24 h following viral challenge. IL-1-induced IL-17A caused the recruitment of neutrophils to the airways and lung. at the peak of viral replication, day 5 post infection, neutrophilia became independent of IL-17A. a meta-analysis study estimated a case-fatality rate of 15.6% following hospitalization due to an exacerbation. cigarette smoke (CS) models showed significantly altered response to influenza infection. accelerated clearance of Haemophilus influenza [38] in comparison to control mice. IL-1 signaling has been shown to be essential for the recruitment of neutrophils in other mouse models mimicking the pathology of stable COPD. IL-1 driven neutrophil recruitment during the first 24 h of infection was mediated by lL-17A, while it became independent of IL-17A at later time points during the exacerbation. IL-17A expression was completely abrogated upon LPS/elastase exposure as well as during the exacerbation. however, IL-17A expression surprisingly remained unaltered and even decreased at the peak of viral replication. corticosteroids and bronchodilators have been shown to reduce the frequency of exacerbations [55]\u2013[57], but have no positive effect on an ongoing episode of exacerbation. a combination therapy of anti-IL-17A and anti-IL-1 may prove more beneficial in improving lung function. the absence of IL-1 alone did not affect viral replication. this is in line with data from Botelho et al. [20] who found similarly elevated viral titers upon neutralization of IL1- as in the complete absence of IL-1R. Figure S2 Impaired infection by influenza virus in mice pretreated with LPS/elastase. the viral load was determined in whole lung including airways and trachea by quantitative real-time PCR and normalized to GAPDH. total numbers of inflammatory monocytes recruited to airways and lungs were calculated according to cell frequencies determined by flow cytometry and total cell influx. results are representative of at least two independent experiments (n = 4\u20135) results are representative of (A) two and (B) three independent experiments.
