{"summary": "rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus of the genus Lagovirus in the family Caliciviridae. the virus causes rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD), a fulminant necrotising hepatitis with a case fatality rate of approximately 90%. this factor prompted investigations into the use of RHDV as a biocontrol agent to manage Australia rabbits were anaesthetised by intramuscular injection of either Zoletil 100 (Virbac, Peakhurst, NSW, Australia) or a combination of Xylazil-20 (Troy Laboratories, Smithfield, NSW, Australia) and Ketamav 100 (Mavlab, Logan, QLD, Australia) rabbit trials were carried out at CSIRO black mountain Laboratories. monoclonal antibody (mab) 1H3 was diluted in sterile PBS and administered intravenously at 1\u2013100 g/kg. the antibody was quantified assuming that one A280 = 1.3 mg/ml. rabbits in passage 10 were given subsequent daily doses of mab 1H3 intramuscularly to maintain selection pressure. rabbits were infected orally with 1 1052 108 capsid gene copies of RHDV. rabbits were euthanised 34 days post-infection or when signs of terminal RHD were detected. rabbits were infected with the original inoculum virus. single adult rabbit was infected by subcutaneous injection with 10% liver homogenate prepared from a wild rabbit that had died from an infection with TUR09. the homogenate was clarified twice by centrifugation for 25 minutes at 4,700 g, 4\u00b0C (Allegra 6R), followed by 30 minutes at 15,000 g, 4\u00b0C (Beckmann Avanti J-25I) cDNA was synthesised from 5 l of RNA using 500 ng of OligodT(18mer) and Invitrogen Superscript III according to manufacturers\u2019 directions. overlapping fragments of the RHDV genome were amplified by PCR using platinum Taq DNA polymerase high fidelity (Life Technologies, Mulgrave, VIC, Australia) some virus genomes could be amplified in a single fragment using the primer pair RHDV-7 fw/RHDV-8 rv. some virus genomes could be amplified in a single fragment using the primer pair RHDV-1 fw/RHDV-13 rv. individual cleaned reads from the original inoculum virus sequence were mapped to the original inoculum consensus sequence. reads from subsequent isolates were mapped to the original inoculum consensus sequence. average sequence coverage was approximately 8,000. antigenic profiles were compared using a panel of seven lagovirus-specific mabs and a sandwich ELISA method. 10% liver homogenates were pre-titrated and used at a dilution that gave an OD492 value closest to 1.2. for each virus, the OD492 value obtained with the non-binding mab 5F5 was set as 0% inhibition. the OD492 value of the virus tested (X) minus the OD492 value of the reference strain (ref) was divided by the OD492 value of the virus tested for mab 5F5 (neg) minus the OD492 value of the reference strain (neg\u2014ref) animal trials were carried out at CSIRO Black Mountain Laboratories. rabbits were given subsequent daily doses of mab 1H3 intramuscularly to maintain selection pressure. rabbits were euthanised either three or four days post-infection, prior to the induction of strong detectable IgM responses. rabbits were infected orally with 1 1052 108 capsid gene copies of RHDV. rabbits were euthanised 34 days post-infection or when signs of terminal RHD were detected. a single animal from each passage was selected for the production of a new virus stock. a 20% tissue homogenate was prepared in PBS. the homogenate was clarified twice by centrifugation for 25 minutes. it was then filtered through a 0.8-M syringe filter (Millex, Bayswater, VIC, Australia) cDNA was synthesised from 5 l of RNA using 500 ng of OligodT(18mer) and Invitrogen Superscript III according to manufacturers\u2019 directions. overlapping fragments of the RHDV genome were amplified by PCR using the primer sets RHDV-1 fw/RHDV-2 rv (5\u2019-GCAAGTCAWAGCARCGGTCCGTTGCAC-3\u2019) some virus genomes could be amplified in a single fragment using the primer pair RHDV-1 fw/RHDV-13 rv. some virus genomes could be amplified in a single fragment using the primer pair RHDV-7 fw/RHDV-8 rv. individual cleaned reads from the original inoculum virus sequence were mapped to the TUR09 genome. reads from subsequent isolates were mapped to the original inoculum consensus sequence. average sequence coverage was approximately 8,000. antigenic variant (RHDVa) reference strain Pv97 (Genbank accession EU250330) [22] was compared using a panel of seven lagovirus-specific mabs and a sandwich ELISA method. 10% liver homogenates were pre-titrated and used at a dilution that gave an OD492 value closest to 1.2. the OD492 value of the reference strain (ref) divided by the OD492 value of the virus tested for mab 5F5 (neg) minus the OD492 value of the reference strain, i.e. ((X\u2014ref) / (neg\u2014ref)) variant viruses were selected by serial passaging through laboratory rabbits with increasing doses of the RHDV-specific mab 1H3. g/kg were administered concurrently with infection in passages 6 and 10 (rather than 24 hours post-infection) replication was suppressed, demonstrating that the virus did not completely escape antibody binding. this may limit the use of the newly generated virus as a biocontrol agent, because in the wild immunity is pre-existing rather than induced. viral titres were clearly inversely correlated with mab 1H3 dose. this correlation was not observed in subsequent passages. the intra-host heterogeneity and majority consensus sequence of the virus population within each isolate was explored by full genome sequencing. VP60 is subdivided into the internal shell (S) and exposed protrusion (P) domain [24]. VP60 is subdivided into the internal shell (S) and exposed protrusion (P) domain [24]. the P domain is further divided into subdomains, of which P2 is the most externally located [24]. position 305 of VP60 is located within the prominent V1-extended loop region (aa 304\u2013314). it is adjacent to three putative histo-blood group antigen binding pockets. the homologous position in Murine norovirus-1 is also a known antibody binding site. increased reactivity was observed with mab 1F10, which cross-reacts more strongly with antigenic variant RHDVa viruses. data confirm that the passaged virus is antigenically distinct from the parent virus and that overall, the antigenic reactivity profile of the virus evolved towards an RHDVa phenotype. 4,368 within the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase coding region (amino acid 202 of the polymerase), affecting a codon for alanine. this mutation was first detected in passage 4 and rapidly became fixed in subsequent passages. this mutation was not observed in any of the unselected passages. the impact of this mutation on viral fitness is presently unclear. the inoculum virus was highly virulent during passaging experiments. it was highly virulent during passaging experiments, causing clinical RHD within 48 hours post-infection and the onset of terminal signs by 4 days post-infection. this study is an experiment in adaptive evolution, monitoring genetic dynamics of the virus population over serial transfer. strong selection pressures may favour rare, extreme and innovative mutations. mutations may also lead to a local peak in the fitness landscape. these changes could have driven the virus into an evolutionary cul-de-sac. by passage 5, high-level replication was again observed for all antibody doses tested, ranging from 5.5\u20136.5 g/kg. this suggests that partial immune escape had occurred by passage 5 as the virus was able to replicate in the presence of previously inhibitory antibody concentrations. s were killed 3\u20134 days post-infection and virus load in the liver was quantified by qRT-PCR. diamonds represent virus loads from individual animals treated with mab 1H3. crosses represent animals that were administered mab 1H3 at the time of infection. virus was not detectable in the animal indicated by an asterisk. both substitutions rapidly became dominant and fixed in the virus population. the emergence of these mutations correlated with the ability of the virus to overcome increased antibody doses. the emergence of these mutations correlated with the ability of the virus to overcome increased antibody doses. ructural model of an RHDV virion consisting of 90 VP60 dimers. the protrusion subdomains P1 and P2 and the shell domain are coloured in light blue, dark blue and grey. position 305 of VP60 is located within the prominent V1-extended loop region. antigenic characterisation by sandwich ELISA showed no change in percent inhibition over serial passage with the mab used for selection, mab 1H3. reduced reactivity was observed with mab 1F10, which cross-react more strongly with antigenic variant RHDVa viruses. reactivity of the original virus and the passaged virus produced in this study was compared to the laboratory reference strains RHDV Bs89 [11] for the mabs 1H3, 2A10, 2G3, 1H8 and 2B4 and the antigenic variant RHDVa Pv97 [22] for the mabs 1F10 and 5D11. there was strong evidence for selection of a synonymous C>T mutation at nucleotide position 4,368 within the RNA the average number of polymorphisms appeared per passage was comparable between selected and control groups. however, the number of polymorphisms clearly increased in later passages compared with earlier passages in both selected and control rabbits. this may be due to adaptation of the virus to laboratory rabbits, since the original inoculum virus was isolated from a wild rabbit. a keystone mutation occurs in a background of neutral potentiating mutations leading to a sudden change in phenotype by \u2018innovation\u2019 [42, 43]. this is in contrast to all-or-none epistasis in which a keystone mutation occurs in a background of neutral potentiating mutations leading to a sudden change in phenotype by \u2018innovation\u2019 [44]."}
