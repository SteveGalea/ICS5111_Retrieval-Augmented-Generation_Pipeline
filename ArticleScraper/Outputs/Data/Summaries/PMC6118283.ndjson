{"summary": "the authors investigated whether laminin gamma 2 (LAMC2) expression, especially serum LAMC2 (sLAMC2) level, was a suitable prognostic factor that could aid in the prediction of survival in PSCC. this study included 114 PSCC patients. the level of sLAMC2 had a higher predictive value for disease-specific survival in early penile cancer than in later-stage penile cancer. a stratification analysis revealed that the level of sLAMC2 had a higher predictive value for disease-specific survival in early-stage PSCC. cytoplasmic accumulation of LAMC2 is correlated with cancer metastasis and poor prognosis. elevated serum LAMC2 levels predicted poor disease-specific survival (DSS) high or low levels of sLAMC2, CRP, and SCC-Ag were distinguished by their respective cutoff values. sLAMC2: 108 ng/mL; CRP: 5.0 mg/mL; and SCC-Ag: 1.5 ng/mL. 90% of the tumor cells staining positive for E-cadherin were detected by RT-qPCR. total RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed using PrimeScriptTM Master Mix. quantitative PCR was performed using SYBR\u00ae Premix Ex TaqTM. cDNA was cloned into the pCDH-EF1-CMV-MCS-T2A-Puro vector. recombinant lentiviruses were packaged in 293T cells. cells were cultured in 96-well plates for the indicated times. two million cells were injected into the foot pads of the mice (n=10/group) the mice were killed after 1012 weeks, and inguinal LNs were examined. statistical analysis All statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS statistical software. the cutoff values of sLAMC2 and CRP were obtained by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. the cutoff value for SCC-Ag followed the clinical guidelines. quantitative PCR was performed using PrimeScriptTM Master Mix (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) with specific primers. the relative expression of genes is presented as 2Ct (normalized against GAPDH expression). d into the pCDH-EF1-CMV-MCS-T2A-Puro vector (System Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA, USA), and LAMC2 shRNAs (Table S3) were inserted into the pLko.1 vector (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) recombinant lentiviruses were packaged in 293T cells and used to construct the stable cell lines. cell the chi-squared test was used for the correlation analyses, the cox proportional hazards regression model was used to calculate the HR for death. a log-rank test was used for the survival analysis, and ROC curve analysis was used to calculate the optimum cutoff values. the concentration of sLAMC2 was markedly higher in PSCC patients with LN metastasis than those in MFP and healthy age-matched volunteers. sLAMC2 was expressed at a significantly higher level in PSCC cells. guinal LN metastasis model in BALB/c nude mice. upper, representative images; lower, bar charts indicating the average number of migrated/invaded cells. LAMC2 promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of PSCC cells. expression of epithelial markers E-cadherin and ZO1 was found to be downregulated in LAMC2-overexpressing 149RCa cells. expression of mesenchymal markers N-cadherin and ZEB1 decreased in LAMC2-silenced Penl1 and Penl2 cells and increased in LAMC2-overexpressing 149RCa cells. between LAMC2 expression level and the clinicopathologic characteristics of PSCC patients Variables No. of patients tLAMC2 sLAMC2 sLAMC2 Low High P-value Age (years) 54 57 28 29 0.708 35 22 0.558 54 57 30 27 38 19 Phimosis No. 33 15 18 0.460 18 15 0.178 Yes 81 43 38 55 26 T stage T1/a 37 22 15 0.204 31 6 0.002** T2\u20134 77 the Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis suggested that tLAMC2, sLAMC2, SCC-Ag, and CRP levels were significantly correlated with DSS in PSCC. patients with a high level of sLAMC2 had markedly lower 3-year survival rates than those with a high level of tLAMC2. sLAMC2 had a higher predictive value for DSS in early-stage penile cancer. the results showed that a high sLAMC2 level indicated a high risk of death in patients at a less-advanced T stage (T1/a or T2) and without LN metastasis (N0/X) sLAMC2 level was significantly associated with DSS in PSCC patients at the T1/a, T2 and N0/X stages. the cumulative 3-year survival rates were markedly lower in the high-LAMC2 group than in the low-LAMC2 group. LAMC2 expression was significantly upregulated in the cancer tissues. the ratio of local PSCC tissues expressing high level of LAMC2 is higher in patients with LN metastasis (LNMP) samples with high or low LAMC2 levels were used to compare differences between groups. sLAMC2 was markedly higher in PSCC patients with LN metastasis than those in MFP and healthy age-matched volunteers. transwell assays to determine the effect of LAMC2 on migration and invasion of PSCC cells. upper, representative images; lower, bar charts indicating the average number of migrated/invaded cells in triplicate experiments.
