{"summary": "toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) induces chronic infection in various sites of human body. it also causes brain infection through the central nervous system as zoonotic parasitosis. in general, T. gondii forms a unique proliferative membrane. ursolic acid is a bioactive substance contained in various medicinal plants. it effectively induces extensive bioactivities, including anti-inflammatory. ursolic acid has the possibility as an anti-parasitic candidate drug. study was carried out to evaluate the anti-T. gondii effect of ursolic acid. it is known as a bioactive substance, and to determine its potential as a promising candidate substance for developing novel anti-toxoplasmosis drugs. results 2.1. Effect of Ursolic acid on the proliferation and growth of T. gondii. UA effectively inhibited the viability of the parasite through the direct inhibition of T. gondii compared with SF. the 50% inhibitory concentration value of UA against T. gondii and T. gondii-infected cells was measured as 94.62 g/mL and 162.25 g/mL, respectively. ndii and T. gondii-infected cells were incubated with different concentrations (50\u2013200 g/mL) of ursolic acid and sulfadiazine for 24 h. the results were carried out three times independently. 0.05 was considered statistically significant. anti-apoptotic effects of Ursolic Acid on PVM. formation of PVM is accelerated in a time-dependent manner after cell invasion of T. gondii. the cells were infected with T. gondii (host cells:T. gondii = 1:5) and T. gondii-infected cells were incubated with the compounds for 24 h. green fluorescence shows morphology of PVM formed by T. gondii proliferation in host cells after T. gondii invasion. the results show effective and clear evidence regarding the effect of anti-T. gondii compounds. the results show that UA has the selective anti-parasitic activity which strongly causes anti-T. gondii effects and suppressing their viability. we evaluated the anti-parasitic activity and the effects of UA on the proliferation and growth of T. gondii using an MTT assay. UA effectively inhibited the proliferation and growth of T. gondii-infected cells as compared with SF. UA effectively inhibited the viability of the parasite through the direct inhibition of T. gondii when compared with SF. activity of T. gondii in the infected host cells by effectively blocking T. gondii as well as the direct inhibitory action against T. gondii. the results were carried out three times independently. T. gondii-infected cells were incubated with different concentrations (25\u2013200 g/mL) of ursolic acid (UA) and sulfadiazine (SF) for 24 h respectively. the results were expressed as a percentage of the control group. the results were presented as mean standard deviation (S.D.) of three independent experiments. the changes were clearly observed under a UV fluorescence. the results indicate the inhibitory effect of UA against PVM formation and the viability of T. gondii. UA effectively inhibited or blocked the PVM formed by T. gondii. hibition of T. gondii in T. gondii-infected Mice induces infectious symptoms and diseases, such as lymphadenopathy and brain injury. the mice were carefully observed during the experimental periods after the injection of T. gondii-infected mice treated with different concentrations (200 and 400 g/mL of UA) the mice showed higher activity and viability than the infected mice treated with UA. the mice were divided into normal group (n = 5), positive group (T. gondii-infected group, n = 5) and experimental groups (3 groups of UA, n = 15) the mice were infected with T. gondii treated by 100, 200, and 400 g/mL of ursolic acid (UA) through the abdominal cavity. in immune deficient patients and HIV patients, T. gondii is one of the infectious parasites that induce parasitic zoonosis. it inhibits defensive mechanisms of cytokines, such as IL-2, -4, -6, -8, and IFN- released from host cells after invasion. it also suppresses the production of protective systems that are activated through the immune-response. UA has anti-protozoa effects against leishmania amazonesis and leishmania infantums. mechanism of action is associated with programmed cell death and nitric oxide (NO) production. all other chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co., Ltd.
