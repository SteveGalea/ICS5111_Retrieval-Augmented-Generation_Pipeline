{"summary": "the 13 top-ranked zoonoses were responsible for 2.2 million human deaths and 2.4 billion cases of illness every year [1] rabies and leptospirosis are estimated to cause five times as many human deaths each year. endemic zoonoses do not trigger as much international concern as emerging zoonotic diseases, such as those caused by Ebola virus. many endemic zoonoses present with non-specific clinical signs in both people and animals. these zoonoses are poorly recognized by healthcare providers [5,6] and are often overlooked in differential diagnoses. the pattern of under-recognition of zoonoses persists. zoonoses are highly vulnerable to the impacts of zoonoses on livelihoods, food security and wellbeing. rural poor generally have limited access to high-quality human and animal health services for clinical care and treatment of illness. a global rationale for prioritizing endemic zoonoses is a shared responsibility. despite large investments in surveillance for diseases such as highly pathogenic avian influenza, fewer than 20% of u.n. member states are able to effectively implement the international health regulations [24]. a complementary approach also needs to be considered to achieve effective global surveillance systems. the GHSA zoonoses action package specifically advocates strengthening surveillance through one health approaches. rabies, anthrax, brucellosis, leptospirosis and echinococcus were identified as the five zoonoses of greatest concern in Ethiopia. recommendations made for strengthening intersectoral surveillance and interventions against these diseases, with regular review to address new emerging zoonotic disease threats. one health approaches that address both endemic and emerging disease are now being advocated specifically in the context of achieving these global goals for sustainable development [25]. technical capabilities such as diagnostic tests have often been prioritized over organizational capacities, such as communication, trust building, political advocacy and leadership, that are critical for improving institutions and systems. women's experiences show poverty is more than just a lack of resource to make better decisions. they also point to ways in which the sense of themselves as capable agents was being eroded. the system appeared always to set them aside while others were privileged. endemic zoonoses are entirely or largely preventable through one health interventions. but many endemic zoonoses are entirely or largely preventable through one health measures targeted at animal or environmental reservoirs and infection sources. vaccination has been one of the most equitable low-cost, high-impact public health measures, saving millions of lives annually in LMICs. one health provides a useful framework for broadening the scope of potential interventions that might be considered by public health agencies, particularly in rural communities. prophylaxis involves administration of rabies immunoglobulin and a multi-dose course of rabies vaccination to people bitten by suspected rabid animals. mass vaccination of animal reservoirs reduces the risk of human exposure and can ultimately result in rabies virus elimination. many challenges remain for poor people in remote, rural communities in accessing and completing PEP regimens [40,41] human deaths can be prevented by prompt administration of PEP and mass vaccination of domestic dog reservoirs. but relative levels of investment in these two arms of prevention are often mismatched. poor people are still dying from rabies due to lack of access to health services with PEP. livestock zoonoses occur widely in LMICs, but remain largely \u2018invisible\u2019. frequent mismanagement of animal and human cases contributed to vicious cycle of ill-health and poverty. zoonoses are often difficult to diagnose and often mistaken for malaria. zoonoses have been implicated as significant causes of human febrile illness. reliable point-of-care diagnostic tests are not available to support clinical management of cases. many patients will experience delays in reaching health facilities. several vaccines exist and are available to prevent many of the widely occurring livestock-associated zoonoses. they have been adopted in more intensive farming systems in high- and middle-income countries, but are not widely used in Africa or other low-income contexts. ruminant and human disease have been reduced in some countries. livestock vaccination has been shown to be effective in reducing abortions and bacterial shedding in cattle under experimental conditions in the Netherlands. livestock vaccination was also used for the first time with the aim of reducing the number of human Q-fever cases. but many questions remain as to the design, evaluation and implementation of such interventions. animals identified for vaccination under epidemiologically optimal strategies are not the same as those considered by owners as the most valuable. decisions will be particularly difficult for interventions directed at disease syndromes with multiple aetiologies, such as febrile illness. the impact of any single intervention will only reduce a proportion of the overall burden of the disease syndrome. in east africa, both B. abortus and B. melitensis are present. but the degree to which their epidemiology overlaps in mixed livestock systems is largely unknown. government involvement is likely to be necessary for successful control of brucellosis in endemic areas. if one health interventions have to be sustained only or largely by direct payments from animal owners, they are unlikely to help overcome existing inequalities that disadvantage the rural poor. if one health interventions have to be sustained only or by direct payments from animal owners, they are unlikely to help overcome existing inequalities. the project aims to break down traditional barriers between veterinary and human health interventions. it builds on the community trust achieved through the provision of a common good (effective control of rabies) funding This research was supported by the UK
