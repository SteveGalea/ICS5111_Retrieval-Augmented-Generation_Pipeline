{"summary": "clinical signs appeared in 26 calves, 6\u20137 months old, and consisted of fever (39.4\u00b0\u201340.1\u00b0C), cough, accelerated pulse and breath, seromucoid nasal discharge, and leukopenia. most animals recovered progressively within 2 weeks after administration of supportive therapy. the nucleotide sequence (GenBank accession no. HQ231763) obtained was analyzed by using NCBI (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and EMBL (www.ebi.ac.uk) tools. by sequence comparison with reference sequences, strain Italy-1/10\u20131 had the same genomic organization of other members of the genus Pestivirus. 95.2 Border disease virus H2121 (Chamois-1) GU270877 66.7 58.1 61.8 64.6 Gifhorn GQ902940 66.7 58.2 65.5 64.2 X818 NC_003679 66.9 59.3 60.7 66.2 Reindeer AF144618 66.3 58.6 65.0 63.2 Classical swine fever virus Brescia X AY578687 66.9 58.5 66.6 66.6 phylogeny was inferred from the full-length genome by using the neighbor-joining method of MEGA4.1 software (9). the analyzed pestiviruses clustered into 6 monophyletic clades based on the full-length genome (A), E2 (B), 5\u2032 untranslated region (C) and Npro (D) sequences of members of the genus Pestivirus. the successful infection was confirmed by viremia and viral shedding through the nasal and fecal routes. seroconversion was demonstrated by using the BVDV-Ab SVANOVIR ELISA (Svanova Biotech AB, Uppsala, Sweden) and virus neutralization (5), with mean optical density value and virus neutralizing titer of 0.398 (cutoff 0.200) and 512, respectively. atypical pestiviruses formed a monophyletic cluster that was approximately equidistant from BVDV-1/BVDV-2 and BDV/CSFV. phylogeny may not support naming HoBi-like strains as BVDV-3 because the proposed nomenclature (8,10) does not reflect the genetic relationship among different pestivirus species. edward et al."}
