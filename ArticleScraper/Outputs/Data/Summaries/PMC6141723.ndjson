{"summary": "dendritic cells are morphologically distinct from all other immune cell types. they are gifted with an unparalleled capacity to take up, process and present self and foreign antigens to both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. they are critical intermediaries between the innate and adaptive immune systems as they stimulate, regulate, and shape both immunity and tolerance in all its disguises. cDC1 cDC2 pDC Infl DCs Mouse Common name CD8+ cDC (LT) CD103+ cDC (NLT) CD4+ CD11b+ cDC (NLT) SiglecH+ BST2+ pDC Ly6C+ monocyte derived infl DCs Other markers TLR3+ CADM1+ XCR1+ BATF3+ CLEC9A+ FLT3+ CD205+ CD24+,S CD11b+ TLR7hi TLR9hi FcRI+ CD206+ CD115+ DC-SIGN+ ZBTB46+ Functions Cross-presentation IL-12 secretion TH1/2 polarization TLR3-induced IFN-/ and IFN- production. different DC subsets are endowed with distinct functions. cDC2 and inflammatory DCs are equipped with a wide range of TLRs. cDC2 and inflammatory DCs are also able to produce IL-12, stimulate CD4+ TH cells and CD8+ T cells by cross-presentation. Depending on their activation, they will instigate a specific immune response. autologous monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs) are used in most clinical trials with DC-based vaccines. however, these moDCs mimic inflammatory DCs. this suggests that stimulation of only one DC subset is most likely not optimal for CTL stimulation. we can roughly distinguish four types of in situ DC-directed vaccines. naked proteins, nucleic acids, viral vectors and nanoparticles represent more immunogenic vaccines. nanoparticles and viral vectors represent more immunogenic vaccines. oncolytic viruses are designed in such a way that they selectively replicate in tumor cells leading to their lysis without affecting normal cells. they cannot be considered as TAA-encoding, DC-targeted therapeutic vaccines. poxvirus-derived vectors are relatively easy to produce at high-titers and stability (43). this is exemplified by the recombinant vaccinia virus, which is based on the attenuated Wyeth strain. m, highly transient expression No Serotype dependent tropsm, infects dividing and non-dividing cells, slow expression onset DC-specific tropism Epithelial tropism Broad tropism DC stimulatory potential High High Wild type low, but attenuated vector high Induction of DC maturation Moderate High High Low Low Low Low High Moderate Most likely high Low (but serum complement inactivation) biosafety level BSL-2 BSL-2 BSL2-3 BSL-1-2 107 plaque forming units (PFU) were injected. no significant treatment-related toxicities were observed. this may be explained by inadequate clonal expansion and/or cytotoxicity. prime-boost regimens consist of at least two different consecutively administered poxviral strains expressing the same TAA. a small randomized trial compared rV-CEA as the initial priming vaccination with three ALVAC-CEA injections vs. three vaccinations with ALVAC-CEA, followed by one rV-CEA (47) viral vaccines were pimped with co-stimulatory signals to skew a TH1 climate. only when the viral vaccine directly infects DCs, processed TAAs will be abundantly presented via MHC-I and MHC-II together with appropriate co-stimulatory molecules to initiate a cytotoxic CTL response. ALVAC\u2013CEA\u2013B7.1 was injected intramuscularly into patients with advanced, unresectable CEA-expressing malignancies. the virus could induce CEA-specific peripheral blood T cells in a proportion of patients. 3 out of 16 patients demonstrated transient disease stabilization, but no disease regression (49). a vaccinia prime\u2013fowlpox boost regime encoding two TAAs (CEA and MUC1) for the treatment of pancreatic cancer, termed PANVAC, has also been evaluated alongside TRICOM. two different studies enrolling patients with metastatic ovarian or breast cancer showed TAA-specific immunity after administration of a poxviral-based vaccine (55, 56) fourteen patients received intratumoral injections on days 1, 4, 8 and 11. tumors injected with ALVAC-B7.1 and ALVAC-IL-12 showed higher intratumoral levels of immunosuppressive cytokines like IL-10 and VEGF. a few trials with poxviral vaccines evaluated its combinatorial potential with other anticancer treatments. no overall survival benefit was seen in the vaccine arm. however, analysis in this larger trial did reveal a significant correlation between magnitude of 5T4-specific antibody responses and improved patient survival. a phase II trial of TG4010 combined with first-line chemotherapy (cisplatin plus gemcitabine) in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) demonstrated a significant 6 month increase in median survival (64) 5T4, melanoma antigen recognized by MART-1, gp100, tyrosinase, HPV16 and 18 E6 and E7. their innate stimulatory properties remain poorly characterized. compared in vivo in rhesus monkeys and in vitro in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. viral vectors derived from viruses of the Adenoviridae family Adenoviruses are non-enveloped dsDNA viruses efficient at delivering DNA to both dividing and quiescent cells, like DCs. they can be readily produced with high titers up to 109 IFU/ml that can be concentrated to 1013 IFU/ml (43). a third generation high capacity HC-AdV stripped of all viral coding sequences was engineered ( preclinical testing of various adenovirus-based antitumor vaccines demonstrates the induction of both protective humoral and cellular immunity as well as eradication of established tumors in mice. intravenous and intradermal delivery appeared the most efficacious for antitumor immunity (79) one out of 17 patients experienced a complete response, but three developed post-vaccination vitiligo. the latter signifies the generation of antigen-specific immunity that was even able to break tolerance to self-antigens. retroviruses are characterized by a ssRNA genome that is reverse transcribed into pro-viral DNA in the cytoplasm of the infected host cell. lentiviruses uniquely replicate in non-dividing cells. lentiviral vectors (LVs) are not very efficient at transducing DCs. LVs are derived from a different genus and have a lower propensity for integrating in potentially dangerous regions within the human genome (100), these studies instigated the optimization of safer LV systems with engineered envelopes, pro-viral and/or packaging proteins. non-integrative LV expression is less stable because it remains episomal and loses the transgenes after target cell replication. the vaccine is either being used as a single agent or in combination with other cancer drugs. other drugs include anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1) therapy. so far, the first female patient with metastatic and recurrent synovial sarcoma, induced a robust NY-ESO-1-specific T cell response after three injections of LV305. ridae family comprises alphaviruses which are small enveloped viruses that transfer a self-replicating ssRNA genome. high-titer virus production is achieved in less than 2 days, be it at a high cost. variants of the Sindbis virus have been preclinically explored for their ability to target and activate DCs in vitro and in vivo. this encapsulation approach tends to passively target the LSFV-IL-12 to tumors and enables repeated administration without the generation of antiviral immunity. the safety of administering these SFV-based vectors intravenously was shown in a phase I/II protocol for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme. viral vectors derived from viruses of the Rhabdoviridae family are enveloped, bullet-shaped (rhabdos refer to rod) virions encapsulating ssRNA. in cancer therapy, this family is mainly known because of its oncolytic virus members derived among others from Vesicular Stomatitis Virus or Maraba virus (125, 126). in 2006, the trial was initiated to assess the safety and toxicity of intratumoral administration of MV-CEA for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (131) no results have been disclosed so far. the general consensus from published (pre-)clinical studies is that virus-based vaccines have the potential to be both safe and efficacious. ridae AAV Coronaviridae Papillomaviridae Baculoviridae Genomic material dsDNA ssRNA ssRNA ssRNA ssRNA circular DNA circular DNA Insert capacity >30 kb 7.5 kb

profoundly successful smallpox eradication program. recombinant vaccinia virus encoding TAAs was administered to advanced carcinoma or metastatic androgen independent prostate cancer patients. this induced elevated levels of anti-TAA antibodies next to TAA-specific CTLs capable of lysing TAA-expressing tumor cells in vitro. rV-CEA or -PSA could only be administered once, at least twice, to result in a measurable immune response. viral vector-neutralizing antibodies completely diminished the cellular and/or humoral anti-TAA effect. the search for alternatives that had less compunction with pre-existing immunity led to evaluation of two Avipoxviral strains. one of the most applied poxviral vaccines (>25 clinical trials) is represented by the PSA-encoding PROSTVAC, which is most often delivered via a prime-boost regimen consisting of recombinant vaccinia followed by fowlpox virus injection. induction of a TH1 polarized antitumor CTL response requires proper stimulation. vaccinia encoding E7 fused to listeriolysin O or LAMP-1 resulted in enhanced uptake. tumors appeared to regress because of increased amounts of IFN- and TNF-secreting CTLs within the spleen. only the vaccines with MHC-I directing listeriolysin O resulted in high intratumoral CTL infiltration. antivaccine and antiIL-2 antibodies, CD4+ T cells, and MUC1-specific CTL responses were reported. patients that had MUC1-specific CTLs showed a longer survival compared to the overall population. a phase III trial did not demonstrate any survival benefit. in stable breast cancer disease (5/13), tumor shrinkage (1/13) and even one complete response with a significant drop in serum IL-6 and IL-8. a vaccinia-based vaccine encoding both PSA and TRICOM was injected intratumorally in 21 patients with locally recurrent prostate cancer. a large randomized phase III trial involving 733 patients with metastatic renal cancer was conducted using MVA-5T4 in combination with first-line treatment of receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib. a phase II trial of TG4010 combined with first-line chemotherapy (cisplatin plus gemcitabine) in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) demonstrated a significant 6 month increase in median survival (64) encoding the HPV16 and 18 E6 and E7 fusion protein was evaluated with heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) encoding DNA and TLR7-stimulating imiquimod. this led to a potent antigen-directed antibody and cytotoxic response in a phase I/II clinical trial for patients with (pre-)malignant cervical lesions (66\u201368) phenotypes observed following priming with ALVAC, MVA, or NYVAC were all reduced when these poxviral vectors were used as a boost (70). Interestingly, Hanwell et al., compared TAA-expression and immunogenicity of 5T4 or gp100 delivered by ALVAC or MVA (71). a third generation high capacity HC-AdV stripped of all viral coding sequences was engineered. about 50% of the trials use TAA-encoding vaccines. the other 50% encode pro-inflammatory factors such as IL-12, type I or type II IFN, TNF-, Flt3L, et cetera or co-stimulatory molecules such as CD40L. in one patient receiving the Ad2-MART-1 vaccine, a complete response was observed that could be attributed to the vaccination (86). only 50% of patients receiving naked DNA encoding CD86 and prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) showed signs of successful immunization but this was 100% when they were inoculated with 5 108 PFUs of PSMA-encoding viral vectors followed by PSMA plasmid boosts. adenoviral vaccine was found to be safe and induce a complete remission rate of 83% in a phase I trial with 12 acute myeloid leukemia patients (93). adenoviral vaccines are mainly evaluated for ex vivo modification of DCs since pre-existing immunity hampers repeated injections in vivo. lentiviral vectors (LVs) are not very efficient at transducing DCs. the reverse transcription process requires cellular deoxynucleoside triphosphates. LV transduction of DCs does not affect their immunophenotype, viability, or maturation capability. LVs have taken a prominent place in cancer therapy with about 60 clinical trials registered today. the few active vaccination-related clinical trials involve subcutaneously delivered integrase-deficient LVs encoding NY-ESO-1. these are directly targeted to DCs in vivo through pseudotyping with a modified Sindbis virus envelope protein. the vaccine regimen was well tolerated and generated a strong anti-NY-ESO-1 specific immune response in more than 50% of sarcoma patients. in general, CMB305 results in stronger and broader integrated responses than LV305 alone. so far, patients receiving the combination experienced greater clinical benefit, more robust immunity and improved overall survival compared to atezolizumab alone. a replication-incompetent SFV-based vector encoding the HPV derived antigens E6 and E7 has been evaluated preclinically. this vector is currently tested in a phase I clinical trial for the treatment of (pre)-malignant cervical lesions (Vvax001) two trials with the same virus-like replicon are registered for the treatment of colon and/or colorectal, breast, lung, and pancreatic cancers (122, 123) the immune responses generated with AVX701 in colorectal cancer patients were compared between stage III and IV patients. the antibody and T cell response tended to be higher in stage III patients, possibly reflecting a less immunosuppressive milieu in the latter. the vaccine was shown to re-activate the suppressed tumor microenvironment with stimulation of TH1 cells, DCs, macrophages, B cells, CTLs and NK cells while downregulating Tregs. a phase I trial for the treatment of liver and breast cancer upon its intramuscular administration is ongoing. parvoviruses can only replicate inside the cell in the presence of a helper virus, such as adenovirus. they can infect dividing and non-dividing cells, making them attractive for delivery of transgenes to DCs. they sustain long-term gene expression with low immunogenicity. a specific serotype is the use of a different serotype or naturally occurring AAV variant (142). a capsid-optimized AAV (serotype 6) showed a 5-fold increase in its transduction efficiency of bone-marrow derived DCs. the only clinical studies using AAVs so far aim to use ex vivo AAV-modified DCs to expand CEA-specific CTLs present in blood of patients with grade IV gastric cancer. virus-based vector encoding human Melan-A with or without GM-CSF resulted in a prophylactic and therapeutic immune response against metastatic melanoma. a single intravenous immunization with only 105 PFU resulted in a prophylactic and therapeutic immune response against metastatic melanoma. a major advantage of HPV as a viral vector system is its capacity to package plasmids up to 8 kb in length, completely devoid of viral sequences. a durable cervicovaginal antigen-specific CTL response was induced by promoting local proliferation and retention of primed CTLs. baculovirus-mediated expression of recombinant heterologous proteins in cultured insect and mammalian cells also represents a widely used and robust protein production baculovirus was shown to efficiently transduce and activate DCs ex vivo with upregulation of co-stimulatory molecules, MHC, type I IFN and other pro-inflammatory cytokines. a CEA-specific CD4+ T cell response was observed upon intramuscular injection of a CEA-encoding baculovirus-derived vector (157) AAVs have been used to infect human DCs with HPV16 E7 (133), cytomegalovirus antigens (134), cytomegalovirus antigens (134), PSA (135), Her2/neu (136), or lactadherin, a membrane-associated self-glycoprotein expressed in breast cancer cells. a capsid-optimized AAV (serotype 6) showed a 5-fold increase in its transduction efficiency of bone-marrow derived DCs. a single intravenous immunization with only 105 PFU resulted in a prophylactic and therapeutic immune response against metastatic melanoma. s encoding Flt3L exhibited a higher capacity to induce DC maturation compared to vectors delivering IL-2 or IL-15. the former more efficiently induced tumor-specific CTLs with expanded epitope repertoire, resulting in therapeutic tumor immunity. the enveloped family of Baculoviridae has been preclinically evaluated to develop anticancer vaccines. this family forms an exception in the sense that they normally infect insects at larval stage. baculovirus-mediated expression of recombinant proteins in cultured insect and mammalian cells also represents a widely used and robust protein production method. intramuscular injection of wild type baculovirus (adjuvants) has shown antitumor efficacy in several murine cancer models 156. a CEA-specific CD4+ T cell response was observed upon intramuscular injection of a CEA-encoding baculovirus-derived vector (157) the lack of overall clinical efficacy can be assigned to: (1) the fact that most patients received immunosuppressive (chemo)therapeutic regimens prior to vaccination, (2) type I IFN-driven antiviral immunity is characterized by a TH1 response. strong CTL responses are generated against TAAs delivered by viral vectors. this antiviral immunity precludes repeated injection of the viral vaccine, hampers transgene expression, neutralizes the vaccine and hinders the strength of TAA-specific cellular immunity. adenoviral-based vaccines are excellent vehicles for tissue-specific delivery of transgenes together with its intrinsic immunogenicity. adenoviral vectors are scavenged by the reticuloendothelial system after systemic injection. adenoviral vectors are scavenged by the reticuloendothelial system. encoding adenoviral vector, pulmonary metastasis in a murine model of osteosarcoma could be treated without putative risks. some viral vectors have been extensively re-engineered in order to alter their tropism or transgene expression. targeting viral vectors to DCs has been explored as a means to tighten the control on where the viral vector is delivered. adenoviral and MVA vectors have been tested as neo-antigen encoding vaccines in the framework of human immunodeficiency virus related disease. a genetic algorithm-based mosaic method was developed to generate artificial protein sequences that could increase cross-reactivity of vaccine responses for diverse HIV-1 isolates. immune checkpoint inhibitors are able to release the brakes on T cells imposed by inhibitory receptors, such as CTLA-4 and PD-1. this is nicely exemplified by the combination of an adenoviral vector, encoding the murine breast TAA TWIST1 with intraperitoneal injection of a bifunctional anti-PD-L1/TGF fusion protein. this combination was shown to induce a more active CTL and NK cell phenotype within mice were treated on days 13 and 20 intraperitoneally with 50 g isotype control or anti-CTLA4 antibody. Tumor growth and survival were examined every 2 days."}
