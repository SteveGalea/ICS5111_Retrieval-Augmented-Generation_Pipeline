RVFV Gn head crystals were grown in reservoir solution of 0.2 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M Mes, pH 6.5, 20% (wt/vol) PEG 8000 at 277 K. diffraction crystals of the complex protein were finally obtained in 0.3 M potassium/sodium tartrate, 20% (wt/vol) PEG 3350, and 0.1 M Bis Tris propane, pH 7.5. a BIAcore 3000 spectrometer was used to measure kinetic constants at room temperature (298 K) all proteins were exchanged into a buffer of 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl and 0.005% (vol/vol) Tween 20. Fifty-microliters of twofold serial-diluted MAb 4\u20135 or control antibody (Ebola monoclonal antibody 13C6) (57) was mixed with equal volume of 100 TCID50 SFTSV (SDYY007) or RVFV (BJ01) at 310 K for 1 h. the virus\u2013antibody mixture was then transferred to 80% confluent Vero cells in a 96-well plate and incubated at 310 K for 1 h peptides were desalted on a 75-m 6-cm precolumn packed with 10 m, 120 ODS-AQ C18 resin (YMC Co., Ltd.) the peptides were separated over a 34-min linear gradient from 5% buffer B (100% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) to 30% buffer B, followed by a 3-min gradient from 30 to 80% buffer B, then maintaining at 80% buffer B for 7 min. candidate pairs satisfying M+ M+ Mlinker M 5 Da were scored for spectrum-peptide matching. pLink searches were filtered by requiring E-value 0.001, false-discovery rate 0.05, spectra count 20 and no more than 10-ppm deviation between the monoisotopic masses of the observed precursor."}
