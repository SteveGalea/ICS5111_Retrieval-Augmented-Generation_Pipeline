{"summary": "no other modern epidemic or pandemic mobilized the global health community to action. calls for pandemic-threat warning systems came from traditional public health policy-makers1 and national governments. the first step in the identification of a pandemic threat requires an outbreak of sufficient size to come to the attention of medical personnel. similar surveillance could help identify behavioural risk factors and high-risk subgroups for zoonotic infections such as Ebola. the most lethal and costly pandemics of the 21st century, i.e. avian influenza, Ebola, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), have been caused by zoonotic viruses. effective surveillance requires questions that assess a range of animal exposures, document experiences of unusual illness and measure contextual factors. the spillover of zoonotic viruses from wildlife, the source of most emerging zoonoses,15 has been difficult to document. zoonotic diseases, such as avian influenza,17 MERS16 and SARS,29 were identified via syndromic surveillance networks. standardized definitions should be easy to develop questions or symptom checklists for syndromic surveillance based on self-reported data. poverty can place individuals and communities at the forefront of zoonotic disease risk through several mechanisms. behavioural surveillance may be used to assess relationships between behavioural risk factors and self-reported experiences of unusual illness that are consistent with the symptoms of zoonotic disease. non-outbreak serosurveys In the field of pandemic threats, biological outcome data could address the weaknesses of any self-reported data. serosurveys of zoonotic viruses have been conducted since the discovery of the Ebola virus in the 1970s. we divided the subjects into three risk categories based on the limited data from previous research on zoonotic disease spillover. high seroprevalences represented the results for all eight of the high-risk subgroups with evidence of previous exposure to a zoonotic pathogen. exposure to wildlife therefore appeared to be associated both with any evidence of viral exposure and with high seroprevalence. since the first known outbreak in 1976, the united states centers for disease control and prevention have recorded 35 documented Ebola outbreaks in Africa. the last few years have witnessed major advances in the development of economically feasible methods for comprehensive serological profiling51,52. these should facilitate the investigation of zoonotic spillover into human populations. we need a better understanding of the mechanisms behind the spillover of zoonotic disease into human populations. there is substantial overlap between hotspots for zoonotic disease spillover and those considered hotspots for HIV, perhaps the best known zoonotic virus. this overlap opens a real possibility of merging attempts to detect zoonotic disease spillover with pre-existing population-based systems that have been used to investigate the HIV epidemic for several decades. standardized biological\u2013behavioural surveillance would complement traditional surveillance. the implementation of integrated biological\u2013behavioural surveillance needs not be frequent to be informative and useful in preventing spillover of zoonotic agents with pandemic potential."}
