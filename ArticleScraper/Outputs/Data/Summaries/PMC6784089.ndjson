{"summary": "HLCC facilities typically have design features that include designated \u201ccold, warm and hot\u201d or \u201cclean and contaminated\u201d zones. other assets of HLCC units include trained teams of healthcare workers, a set of practiced protocols designed to minimize risk of nosocomial pathogen spread. a few dozen medical centers have since developed some HLCC capability. HLCC care is extraordinarily expensive and the number of HLCC beds is likely to remain extremely limited, making it unlikely that such care can be provided with the same degree of robustness in developing nations and austere environments. a very small number of patients with other viral hemorrhagic fevers have also been successfully cared for in such facilities. infectivity is typically expressed in terms of the \u2018Infectious Dose 50\u2032 or ID50, the dose necessary to infect, on average, 50% of exposed individuals. some pathogens may be highly infectious, but lack a propensity for person-to-person spread. the disease is rarely transmitted from person-to-person, however, and thus poses little risk to contacts or health care personnel. the greater the R0 value, the more likely an outbreak could occur. pathogens with an R0 > 1 are not likely to lead to large outbreaks. mumps provides an example of a contagious disease with an R0 value of 3\u201310. type A tularemia has an ID50 of approximately 10 organisms. tularemia would therefore not warrant care in an HLCC unit. a very effective vaccine against measles protects healthcare workers from nosocomial transmission. the list is not necessarily comprehensive and was based, in part, on an informal survey taken of HLCC unit leaders in the united states. the authors are certainly open to consideration of other diseases or newly emerging diseases that might be added to the list in the future. Possibly Droplet Nuclei 1000 viral particles 2 1.14 [37] H7N9 Influenza Respiratory Droplets 0.1\u20130.47 [37] Smallpox Droplet Nuclei, Scabs 1\u2013100 3.5\u20137.0 [38,39,40,41] Monkeypox Respiratory Droplets No data 0.33 [43] Hendra No Data No data No data Pneumonic Plague Respiratory Droplets 100 to 500 organisms by inhalation. the list of pathogens that fulfill the criteria of infectivity, communicability, and hazard is relatively short. we argue that patients infected with these uncommon diseases warrant HLCC care, when such care is available. patients infected with HHCDs have been successfully managed in conventional settings when HLCC is unavailable. we advocate that these diseases be evaluated as potential candidates for HLCC based on the criteria we have proposed. a significant amount of data is being generated in the current Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo on vaccines and therapeutics against EVD. despite this, there is thus far no agreed upon list of diseases that should be cared for in an HLCC setting. despite this, there is thus far no agreed upon list of diseases that should be cared for in an HLCC setting."}
