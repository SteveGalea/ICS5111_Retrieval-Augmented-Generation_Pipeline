{"summary": "quantitative meta-analyses of published studies examined the association of dampness or mold in homes with respiratory infections and bronchitis. most studies contained multiple estimated ORs. resulting summary estimates of ORs from random effects models ranged from 1.38 to 1.50. a number of qualitative summaries of this literature are available [1-3] the institute of medicine found sufficient evidence to document an association between indoor dampness or mold and upper respiratory tract symptoms, cough, wheeze, and asthma symptoms in sensitized persons. central estimates of ORs ranged from 1.30 to 1.50, with all 95% CIs excluding the null. prior non-quantitative reviews have reported consistent associations between dampness or mold and respiratory infections. no quantitative meta-analysis of this relationship has been reported. papers meeting all of the following criteria were selected for use in the meta-analyses. based on original data; i.e., not a review article or meta-analysis. report effect estimates as odds ratios (ORs) or risk ratios (RRs) otitis media, sinusitis, bronchitis, or pneumonia at least once; chest cold with wheeze; otitis media; pneumonia; bronchitis times per year Respiratory infections excluding otitis media 17 same as listed in cell above. we performed one set of analyses including only results from studies that controlled for potential confounding. a meta-analysis would use input data only from studies with the same precisely defined risk factor, health outcome, and population. we did not distinguish between dampness, mold, dampness or mold, and dampness and mold as risk factors. occupant-reported dampness and/or mold was determined in each study. the category of bronchitis includes acute bronchitis, normally the result of an acute respiratory infection, and chronic bronchitis, which may be unrelated to an infection. we produced a summary estimate for the respiratory infections group after excluding findings for relatively nonspecific upper respiratory outcomes that seemed most susceptible to inclusion of allergic or irritant symptoms. variances and 95% CIs reported in each reviewed study were first transformed to the log scale. the transformed results for each outcome category were then combined using a random effects model. results based on the model described above were compared to those obtained from secondary analyses using fixed effects models. Table 1 provides the number of studies for each health outcome category and the specific outcomes from reviewed studies included in each category. it was not possible to summarize findings for acute or infectious bronchitis separately. RI, B cross sectional 1,460 Yes Rylander and Megevand 2000 [41] RI, B** cross sectional 304 No Spengler et al. 1994 [42] RI, B cross sectional 12,842 Yes Stark et al. 2004 [43] RI, B cross sectional 5,951 Yes Stark et al. 2003 [7] RI birth cohort 499 Yes Strachan 1988 [44] RI cross sectional 873 No Sun et estimates derived from fixed effects models were also very similar to the estimates in Table 1 - the maximum change in central estimate OR was 0.04. for the respiratory infection group, excluding RR values reported by two studies changed the central estimate by less than 0.01 and confidence interval endpoint endpoint endpoint endpoints by 0.03 or less. a series of models excluding each finding sequentially did not identify highly influential single findings. the two most extreme findings were not from large studies. additional models were constructed with specific subgroups of respiratory infection outcomes. the width of the boxes (some so small they appear as points) is proportional to the precision of the study. the left vertical line marks an odds ratio of 1.0, corresponding to no increased risk. most of the reported odds ratios are greater than unity. dampness and mold are causally related to the bronchitis and respiratory infections. there have been at least three major qualitative reviews of the associations of dampness and mold with health outcomes. this review provided no conclusions relating to the association of dampness with bronchitis. based on similar European studies, reported an OR (95% CI) of 1.38 (1.29-1.47) this compares well to the summary OR reported here for dampness or mold in residences and bronchitis. the outcome categories included in this review contain a variety of specific diseases, with all but chronic bronchitis caused by a range of infectious organisms. bronchitis is generally caused not by respiratory infection, but by recurring injury or irritation to the lining of the bronchi. an apparent increase in respiratory infections in association with dampness or mold could occur from increased numbers of infections, or from more serious infections that are more clinically apparent. studies have demonstrated inflammatory and immunosuppressive responses to the spores, metabolites, and components of specific microorganisms found in damp buildings. our analysis is subject to multiple limitations. estimates from random effects models should be interpreted with caution. the test of heterogeneity used here has low power to reject null hypothesis when the number of included findings is small. we did not estimate effects for a category of lower respiratory infections because these findings were mostly for acute bronchitis. there were only seven findings for pneumonia from three studies (ORs 0.79, 1.30, 1.33, 1.71, 1.77, 1.85, and 2.3), too few to allow confidence in a meta-analysis. two prior reviews have considered whether biased subjective response by building occupants in dampness studies might have positively biased the findings. most studies included here relied on occupant reporting of dampness and mold, a possible source of systematic bias and error. only two of the 23 studies included here were among the 12 included in Antova et al. findings for bronchitis here and in pooled data analysis of over 58,000 children were very similar, even though Antova et al. adjusted for 13 potential confounding factors. acute lower respiratory infections are the leading cause of death in children below five years old worldwide. acute lower respiratory infections are the leading cause of death in children below five years old. acute lower respiratory infections are the leading cause of death in children below five years old worldwide. preventing or remediating dampness and mold in residences, a very common condition, may substantially reduce the burden of respiratory infections. this review provides evidence that preventing or remediating dampness and mold in residences, a very common condition, may substantially reduce the burden of respiratory infections. WJF conceived the project, performed the literature review, abstracted the findings, and drafted the manuscript. MJM assisted in the literature review and the analysis and interpretation of the data."}
