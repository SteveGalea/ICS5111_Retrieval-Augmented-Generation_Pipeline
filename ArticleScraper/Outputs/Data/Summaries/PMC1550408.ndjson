{"summary": "a substantial proportion of respiratory tract diseases of suspected infectious origin may be caused by the recently described human bocavirus (hBoV) the aim of this study was to investigate the frequency and potential clinical relevance of hBoV in pediatric patients. hBoV is closely related to the minute virus of canines (MVC) and the Bovine Parvovirus (BPV), which have been classified in the genus Bocavirus within the Parvoviridae. hBoV has not been propagated in cell culture, and there is no animal model so far. hBoV was detected in 18 (5.6 %) of 324 respiratory samples. samples positive for other viruses (RSV, influenza virus A and B, hMPV) were excluded from the study. hBoV PCR and sequencing DNA was extracted from 200 l of the samples using the High Pure Viral Nucleic Acid Kit. the elution volume was 50 l. PCR reactions were carried out in a 50 l volume consisting of 5 l extracted DNA. all PCR products from positive reactions were sequenced completely in both directions. one negative control was extracted and amplified for every five NPA samples. negative controls were found to be negative for hBoV DNA. amplification of hBoV DNA was performed with the NP-1 primers BoV188F (GAGCTCTGTAAGTACTATTAC) and BoV542R (CTCTGTGTTGACTGAATACAG) the sensitivity of the hBoV assay was approximately 10. 901 nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) of 786 hospitalized infants and children with febrile respiratory tract diseases were received for viral diagnostic evaluation. median age of the patients was 1.6 years (mean age 3.4 years; range 12 days \u2013 16 years), and 59 % were boys. 66 samples had to be excluded from retrospective testing of hBoV DNA. hBoV PCR 835 87 (10.3 %) 59.8 % hBoV positive with coinfections 87 34 (39.1 %) 58.8 % hBoV positive with coinfections 901 7 (0.8 %) 14.3 % Results of hBoV PCR 835 87 (10.3 %) 58.8 % hBoV positive with coinfections 87 34 (39.1 %) 58.8 median age of patients with viral respiratory tract infections p-values1 for groupwise comparison Infection with n Median age RSV Adeno Influenza A hBoV 87 1.8 p 0.0001 p = 0.0046 p = 0.0031 RSV 158 0.7 p 0.0001 p 0.0001 Adenovirus 53 2.7 p = 0.8 Influenzavirus A 98 2.4 1by Mann-Whitney-test Infections with hB clinical data were available for 63 of the 87 hBoV positive NPAs. the patients suffered from upper and/or lower respiratory tract diseases. a statistical analysis of this aspect was not possible. hBoV infections were almost as frequently found as infections with influenza A virus, the second most common respiratory infection. hBoV infections were considerably more frequent than infections with influenza B, parainfluenzae, and adenoviruses. PCR assays are more sensitive than antigen detection methods. a real-time PCR assay is currently under development. a second potential reason for differing infection frequencies may be due to regional and temporal differences in the incidence of hBoV infection. in general, seasonal differences of sample acquisition may account for varying incidence numbers. in our study, for example, proportions of influenza A, parainfluenza 3 and adenovirus infections were considerably different between winter seasons. but this was not the case for hBoV infections. the age distribution of hBoV infections found in our study is similar to previous reports. most hBoV infections occurred between 6 months and 3 years of age. this distribution is compatible with protection from infection by maternal antibodies in the first year of life. hBoV is an aggravating factor of respiratory diseases, an innocent bystander that is just detected by chance. it is uncertain at present, if hBoV is indeed an etiologic agent of respiratory tract (or other) diseases. the authors declare that they have no competing interests. son for helpful comments on the manuscript."}
