{"summary": "CEACAM1 is a type I transmembrane protein with a heavily glycosylated extracellular region composed of four Ig-like domains, a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tail. in the rat liver there are two allelic variants of CEACAM1 which differ by 16 amino acids in their N-terminal domains [2], [4] and two major splice variants, designated 4L and 4S, that are distinguished by in mouse mammary carcinoma cells, CEACAM1-4S induced glandular morphogenesis. mutation of phenylalanine 445 at the C-terminus of the 4S cytoplasmic domain compromised interactions with the actin cytoskeleton. this suggests interactions of CEACAM1-4S with the cytoskeleton were an important determinant of glandular morphogenesis. transmembrane domain mutations in both GXXXG and tyrosine residues have both positive and negative effects on the anchorage independent phenotype produced by wild type CEACAM1-4S. our results show that transmembrane mutations in both GXXXG and tyrosine residues have both positive and negative effects on the anchorage independent phenotype. line 253T was established from a 2-acetylaminofluorene induced rat hepatocellular carcinoma. the anchorage dependent cell line was isolated from 253T by limiting dilution cloning. 1.5104 cells were plated in a 24-well plate for cell proliferation assays. the plasmid and the PCR product were dephosphorylated using Antarctic phosphatase (New England Biolabs), heat-treated to inactivate the phosphatase, and run on a 1% agarose gel. bands corresponding to the plasmid DNA and CEACAM1-4S PCR product were purified using the Geneclean spin kit (Qbiogene, Morgan Irvine, CA, USA) the plasmid was transformed into one Shot OmniMax 2 T1 ten of the 12 predicted transmembrane domains included G428, strongly suggesting the presence of the two motifs centered on G432 (G428-IVI-G432 and G432-SVA-G436) all of the predicted transmembrane domains contained Y445 and 7 of 12 contained Y448, indicating the presence of the two motifs. valine does not have an aromatic side chain; 3) valine should not disrupt the alpha helix or alter transport to the plasma membrane. mutagenesis was performed on the pCI-neo plasmid using the QuikChange II XL Site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. oligonucleotide primers used for mutagenesis were as follows. a Y448V mutation was introduced into the Y445V mutant using the following primer set. a Y448V mutation was introduced into the Y445V mutant using the following primer set. cells were blocked for 15 min with 1% normal goat serum (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS. cultures were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 min, quenched in 0.1 M glycine in PBS, and incubated at 4\u00b0C for 30 min. anchorage independent growth cells harvested using non-enzymatic cell dissociation solution (Sigma-Aldrich), suspended in 0.76% low melting point agar diluted 11 with 2 complete Waymouth medium. plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for three weeks and analyzed microscopically to identify anchorage independent clones. immunoblot analysis was performed on crude membrane isolates from 253T-NT cells stably transfected with empty vector. cell pellets were thawed on ice and lysed following 10 passages through a 20-gauge needle. membranes were centrifuged at 3,500 rpm for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. BN-PAGE gels were immunoblotted onto PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad) transfer was performed using bio-Rad's semi-dry transfer apparatus for 1 hour at 25 V. cells were incubated in 8% acetic acid for 15 min, rinsed with water and air-dried. monoclonal antibody 9.2 (MAb 9.2) was provided by Drs. Werner Reutter and Oliver Baum at the Free University, Berlin, Germany [35] the preparation of polyclonal rabbit anti-peptide antibodies specific for the CEACAM1-4L and CEACAM1-4S has been previously described [36] secondary antibodies used for indirect immunofluorescence labeling were Alexa-488 conjugated goat anti-mouse and goat anti-mouse-HRP conjugated secondary antibody. CEACAM1-4S cDNA was amplified by PCR from the total cDNA product using primers: CEACAM1-4S Forward 5\u2032CAGGAATT-CATGGAGCTAGCCTCGGCT-3\u2032 and CEACAM1-4S Reverse 5\u2032-CGAGTCGACTCGTCAGATCC-3\u2032. the primers contained EcoRI and SalI restriction sites. plasmid was dephosphorylated using Antarctic phosphatase (New England Biolabs) selection of sites for Mutagenesis Mutation were chosen based on the consensus location of the transmembrane domain predicted by different membrane topology algorithms shown in Table 1. all of the predicted transmembrane domains lacked the terminal GLSE predicted by Kyte Doolittle and Hopp-Wood (Table 1) and thus did not include the G420-LSE-G424 motif. a G424L mutation was introduced to disrupt the G428-IVI-G432 and the G432-SVA-G436 motifs. to disrupt tyrosine mediated interactions, Y445 and Y448 were replaced with V, the choice of a tyrosine to valine mutation being based on following considerations.

(D) empty vector; (E) G424L; (F) G432L. the growth suppressed phenotype displayed by glycine to leucine mutants appeared to be dominant over the growth suppressed phenotype displayed by glycine to leucine mutants. all of the sublines with both glycine to leucine and tyrosine to valine mutations displayed enhanced anchorage independent growth in soft agar. 253T-NT cells expressing wild type and Mutant Forms of CEACAM1-4S proliferated 2.2 times faster than 253T-NT cells carrying the empty vector and from 1.4-2.2 times faster than cells transfected with glycine mutants. these data suggested that the CEACAM1-4S transmembrane domain was controlling interactions involved in growth under anchorage independent conditions. subcutaneous tumors were harvested from animals at three weeks after injection. tumors produced by cells expressing wild type or mutant CEACAM1-4S were 5.5- and 6.5-fold larger by weight. tumors produced by cells expressing wild type or mutant CEACAM1-4S were 1.9-, 1.25-, and 2.14-fold larger than those produced by cells transfected with the wild type protein. the effects of mutations were not as clear-cut as those observed for soft agar. the mutation compromised and the Y448V or the quadruple mutation enhanced the ability of CEACAM1-4S to produce tumors in nude mice. the effect of G to L mutations on CEACAM1-4S interactions was analyzed by blue-native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) wild type and single G-to-L mutants of CEACAM1 demonstrated an apparent molecular mass by BN-PAGE that was approximately 100 kDa higher than the double glycine mutant. a single GXXXG motif was sufficient to mediate dimerization of CEACAM1-4S. study focused on the CEACAM1 transmembrane domain, a relatively uncharacterized region shared by both the 4L and 4S isoforms. cell model for these studies was an anchorage dependent, CEACAM1 negative subclone designated 253-NT that was derived clonally from the parental rat 253T cell line [6] soft agar cultures of 253-NT cells showed no sign of significant growth. d at Similar Levels on the Surface of Stably Transfected 253T-NT Cells Sequence analysis showed that the CEACAM1-4S transmembrane domain contained multiple GXXXG dimerization motifs. two C-terminal tyrosine residues in other transmembrane receptors were involved in transmembrane domain dependent signaling events [30], [31], [32] immunoblot analysis indicated that the wild type and mutant proteins all had an apparent molecular mass of 105 kDa, the expected size for CEACAM1-4S isoform [2], suggesting post-translational processing has not been altered. 72\u201383% of the cells were positive for either wild type or mutated forms of CEACAM1-4S. lysates prepared from wild type cells and each of the 253T-NT transfected cell lines were resolved on 7.5% SDS-polyacylamide gels. analysis of expressed wild type and mutant CEACAM1-4S protein shows that reactive band corresponding to CEACAM1-4S had the same apparent molecular mass (105 kDa) 253T-NT cells expressing wild type were grown in soft agar. sublines expressing tyrosine mutants of CEACAM1-4S showed a 3.5-fold increase in colony size relative to cells transfected with the wild type protein. the effect of transmembrane domain mutations on anchorage independent growth was determined from changes in the average areas of soft agar colonies. image ProPlus software was used to calculate the average area of soft agar colonies. sublines were either significantly smaller or larger than those formed by cells transfected with wild type (WT) CEACAM1-4S. cells expressing wild type or mutant CEACAM1-4S were 5.5- and 6.5-fold larger by weight than those generated by cells transfected with the empty vector or the single G424L mutant. cells expressing the wild type protein were 5.5- and 6.5-fold larger by weight than those generated by cells transfected with the empty vector. cells expressing CEACAM1-4S with single Y448V, double Y445V/Y448V or quadruple G424L/G432L/Y445V/Y448V mutations produced tumors that were 1.9-, 1.25-, and 2.14-fold larger than those produced by cells transfected with the wild type protein. tumor nodules formed by 253-NT cells transfected with either wild type or transmembrane domain mutant 3T-NT expressing wild type CEACAM1-4S; (C\u2013F) tumors of 253-NT cells expressing the following mutants: (C) G424L with MAb 9.2; (D) G424L and G432L with MAb 5.4; (E) Y445V and Y448V with MAb 9.2; (F) Y445V and Y448V with MAb 9.2. membrane protein lysates were prepared and resolved by BN-PAGE. proteins were transferred onto PVDF membranes and probed with monoclonal antibody 9.2. glycine-to-leucine mutations disrupted one or more transmembrane domain GXXXG motifs. a double glycine mutation disrupted all of the GXXXG motifs. a decrease in either homo- or hetero- cis-dimerization would be expected if these motifs were sole mediators of this interaction. single glycine to leucine mutations produced the growth suppressed phenotype but only double mutations hampered dimerization. the effects of transmembrane domain mutations on growth in vivo were similar to those observed in vitro. phenotypes manifested in vitro by cells expressing transmembrane domain mutants are recapitulated in vivo. this suggests these changes are intrinsic to the transmembrane domain and are not the result of extrinsic factors e.g., microenvironment, that change the phenotypic effects of CEACAM1-4S by altering its proteomic context. a combination of structural and functional data provides a more accurate location of the transmembrane domain, one that incorporates the GAIAG motif at the N-terminus. similar reasoning can be applied to the C-terminus where 5 of 12 transmembrane prediction algorithms placed Y448 outside the transmembrane domain. however, mutation of either Y445 or Y448 led to the soft agar growth enhanced phenotype. aromatic rings of phenylalanine, tryptophan (W) or tyrosine are thought to involve pi-stacking, a process that creates an attractive force when aromatic rings assume energetically favored stacking geometries. aromatic pairs (WXXW or YXXY) were significantly over-represented compared to their predicted frequency, suggesting a functional role for these sequences. rosine phosphorylation did not disrupt the association between IgM and its signaling partners, Ig-alpha/Ig-beta. a YS/VV mutation diminished signaling and association with Ig-alpha/Ig-beta. a lack of a properly spaced hydroxy group may be the reason. studies are needed to define downstream signaling events impacted by re-expression of CEACAM1-4S or by transmembrane domain mutations. of particular interest will be the identity of pathways inactivated/activated by tyrosine mutations that lead to the positive growth effects of tyrosine mutations."}
