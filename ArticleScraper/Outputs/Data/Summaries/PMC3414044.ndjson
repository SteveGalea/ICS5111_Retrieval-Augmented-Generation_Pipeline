{"summary": "the incidence of recognized infectious disease transmission in organ recipients is estimated at 1% on the basis of limited data (2). uniquely for tissue transplantation, the incidence of transmission may be further reduced by postprocurement processing. chikungunya virus, dengue virus, Babesia spp., and trypanosoma cruzi have resulted in clusters of infections transmitted to organ recipients in regions where the pathogens are not endemic. the biology of disease transmission from allografts has not been well studied. WNV is asymptomatic in 80% of immunocompetent persons infected by mosquito bites. viremia in blood donors is typically detected within 1\u20135 days after infection. viremia may be complicated by low-level viremia. lack of similar reports of WNV transmission to tissue recipients may reflect underrecognition, i.e., differences in transmissibility, clinical symptoms, diagnostic approaches, immunosuppression, and clinical follow-up of the recipient. disease detection is dependent on skills, knowledge, and heightened awareness of clinicians caring for allograft recipients. panosoma cruzi (i.e., Chagas disease) have resulted in clusters of infections transmitted to organ recipients in regions where the pathogens are not endemic. more accurate risk assessment requires data regarding the epidemiology and transmission characteristics of a specific organism in a specific graft type. WNV viremia in blood donors is typically detected within 1\u20135 days after infection. viremia may persist despite the appearance of antibodies within 7\u201310 days after exposure. the value of reports of persistent detection of WNV nucleic acid in urine remains to be determined (7). clinical symptoms, diagnostic approaches, immunosuppression, clinical follow-up of the recipient, and underreporting (12). NAT is useful for detecting infection only in blood samples of viremic donors and is not available for every potential organism (22). donor-derived infectious disease transmission remains difficult to recognize and document. current surveillance systems that identify transmission events are passive. active surveillance would increase knowledge of transmissibility and might detect emerging infectious agents within recipients of organs or tissues. organization and website Role Food and Drug Administration Regulates transplantation of human cells and tissues. fda requires tissue establishments to investigate and report serious adverse events related to infectious disease transmission. important issues remain to be addressed before a useful system could be deployed nationally (12) such data could be used in evaluating effectiveness of current donor screening and testing strategies and developing standardized research methods for use in assessing donor evaluation tools. current surveillance systems that identify transmission events are passive. it is unlikely that most transmission events could be detected by passive surveillance alone. transmission rates are likely to vary among donor and recipient groups. organizations involved in detection, investigation, and communication of organ and tissue transplant\u2013associated infections. fda requires tissue establishments to investigate and report serious adverse events related to infectious disease transmission Organ Procurement and Transplant Network. important issues remain to be addressed, such as standard definitions and incentives for participation. such data could be used in evaluating effectiveness of current donor screening and testing strategies and developing standardized research methods for assessing donor evaluation tools. the data required fall into several general areas as described below and summarized in Table 3. Key research factors and needs for organ and tissue transplant\u2013associated infections. compliance is voluntary and accuracy of the data is limited by incomplete return rates. the discard rate of donor organs on the basis of microbiologic testing are not collected by OPTN. improved testing might change the denominator by increasing or decreasing the number of available allografts. the availability of tissues and organs for transplantation could be increased without compromising safety. a networked infrastructure is essential for rapid traceability of tissues and organs from common donors when donor-derived disease outbreaks occur in transplant recipients. individual tissue banks rely on hospitals to return implant cards to assess use of allograft materials. compliance is voluntary and accuracy of the data is limited by incomplete return rates. improved testing might change the denominator by increasing or decreasing the number of available allografts for transplantation. there are few data regarding the effect of tissue processing on decreasing or eliminating infectious organisms. the effect on the risk for transmission of antimicrobial drug therapy in donors or recipients is unknown. the availability of tissues and organs for transplantation could be increased without compromising safety. a shared research agenda among the allograft communities can address gaps in assessing risk and developing more effective donor screening and testing strategies. gaps can be addressed by a shared, overarching research agenda among the allograft communities."}
