{"summary": "despite the relatively rare occurrence of TTIs, the microbial safety of transfusion continues to arouse substantial medical, public and political interest. all over the world there have been outbreaks and the spread of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases (EID) locally acquired hepatitis E cases, caused by genotype 3 virus, predominantly originating from pigs, have been observed at different rates across Europe16\u201318. emerging pathogens with a blood phase are potentially transmissible through transfusion. septicaemia remains the most prevalent complication of blood transfusion. PR of blood and blood components is an intervention that may mitigate the risk posed by emerging and other pathogens. amotosalen can intercalate in helical regions of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA)24. amotosalen can form covalent mono-adducts with thymidine bases. the unbound photosensitiser is adsorbed in the final step of the procedure. the THERAFLEX-MB plasma system uses methylene blue (MB) and visible light to reduce pathogens in single donor units of plasma. it uses a 0.65 m membrane filter which removes residual leukocytes, RBCs, PLTs and aggregates. occult hepatitis B virus (HBV)72, dilution by sample pooling73, and other situations including the presence of pathogen variants. amotosalen reacts with nucleic acids and membrane lipids of PLTs that may have an impact on PLT function. amotosalen reacts with nucleic acids and membrane lipids of PLTs. a recent cochrane review systematically evaluated 12 randomised controlled trials comparing clinical effects of Intercept\u00ae and Mirasol\u00ae PLTs to standard PLT transfusions in predominantly haematological patients100. the review found high-quality evidence that PR PLT transfusions do not affect all-cause mortality, the risk of clinically significant or severe bleeding, or the risk of a serious adverse event100. PRT efficacy on high pathogen loads during acute or chronic stages of infections is uncertain. criteria and methodologies to evaluate and compare the efficacy of PRT in reducing the infectivity of treated blood component need to be established69,103. arthropod-borne diseases such as dengue, chikungunya, west Nile virus (WNV) infection and malaria have emerged and/or re-emerged in Europe showing an increase in local, sporadic outbreaks. there is a risk that other arthropod-borne pathogens, such as the Zika virus (ZIKV), could also be introduced into continental Europe. emerging pathogens with a blood phase are potentially transmissible through transfusion and may present challenges to the safety of the blood supply. the prevention of TTIs is primarily based on the exclusion of donors at risk of being infected and, where possible, laboratory screening of donations. this reactive approach calls for a re-evaluation of current practices. amotosalen (furanocoumarin) can intercalate in helical regions of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA). amotosalen can form covalent mono-adducts with thymidine bases. biochemical mechanism of nucleic acid damage by UVC involves the generation of pyrimidine dimers which prevent replication of the genetic material. methylene blue (MB) and visible light to reduce pathogens in single donor units of plasma. studies have shown that such levels of reduction may significantly decrease the transmission of disease through transfusion66,67. in many cases, however, the level of reduction does not correlate well with the extent to which infectivity is reduced68,69. studies to determine which levels of pathogen reduction will significantly reduce the probability of disease transmission are essential to fully determine just how effective PRT methods really are. the pathogen reduction efficacy of these technologies may be limited because of: large pathogen loads; 2) resistant forms of infectious agents; 3) inaccessibility of pathogens due to bag design; 4) poor light energy delivery due to interfering substances; 5) potential human error during blood processing. PRTs have been recognised as efficient in reducing bacterial contamination of PLTs and may offer protection against infectious threats from unknown EID. cytomegalovirus screening strategies and gamma-irradiation of blood components could cease if all cellular blood components were treated with PRTs. affordable, efficient PRT of all blood component types may offer opportunities for new safety strategies against known, emerging and re-emerging future threats to blood safety. in the future, PRT may allow donor selection criteria, the requirements of a donor selection questionnaire, infectious disease screening and travel deferral to be relaxed. experts presented details of the current implementation in the selected EU/EEA Member States and Switzerland or its application during infectious disease outbreaks. in 14 of 31 MS (45%), PLTs are not treated with PRT. data on the PR of PLTs and plasma in Lichtenstein are not available. pathogen reduction technologies have been applied to mitigate the risk of TT CHIKV and/or DENV in the French west indies. a complete interruption of all donations could jeopardise the supply of PLTs due to their short storage time. the evolving regulatory landscape has influenced health care providers to consider PR to mitigate bacterial contamination of PLTs. the ECDC has recommended the use of PRT in outbreaks of infectious diseases for which screening is not available111. the scale of implementation and components subjected to PR could be determined based on the sustainability of the measure, the anticipated magnitude and geographical spread of an outbreak, and the type of transfusion-transmissible pathogen. only two countries (6%), Belgium and Iceland, employ universal PR of both plasma and PLTs. the extent of partial implementation of PR of PLTs varies widely. the extent of partial implementation of PR of PLTs varies widely. in 14 of 31 MS (45%), PLTs are not treated with PRT. a complete interruption of all donations, especially in big cities or remote islands, could jeopardise the supply of PLTs due to their short storage time. the use of PRT during emerging infectious disease outbreaks has been recommended by the FDA. the EU Directive110 defines preventive measures that must be applied to blood donors each time they donate. the legal basis of this legislation allows the MS to adopt more stringent measures on a national basis. from the legislative aspect, PRT is not mandatory but may be considered a more stringent intervention that can be applied during an outbreak of infectious disease. only two countries implemented universal PRT for both PLTs and plasma. but national competent authorities consider the PR of blood components as a more stringent intervention. a country at risk of infectious disease outbreaks that threaten the safety of the blood supply may consider implementing PRT. at the time of the meeting, 6 of 33 blood establishments in Austria use PRT. two plasma collection centres apply PR of PLTs and four WB collection centres perform PR of PLTs. reasons for implementation are a cessation of the sterility testing of PLTs. observed operational consequences of PRT include increased operational complexity, adaptation of previous production steps, potential product loss, and generation of new risks. in the capital region, around 3,300/2,800 units of PR PLTs were produced/transfused annually in the period 2013\u20132018. in the last decade, France has experienced 4\u20138 TTBIs per year (1 death every 2 years) no TTBI were reported after the implementation of PR-PLTs in 2018. there were no differences in risk of PLT refractoriness between 2018 and 2017. the reported rate of bacterial TTIs was 0.28/106 transfused RBC units and 7.1/106 transfused PLT units. such low rates result from the implemented NAT screening of donations for the presence of existing viruses like HIV. a large spread of WNV may result in the deferral of a large proportion of laboratory-positive donors. implementing the system on a national scale would presumably reduce the transmission of severe viral infections, including EIDs by transfusion15,16. in 2018, about 13,000 PR PLTs (5.77% of the total PLT concentrates transfused nationwide) were transfused. in 2018, around 130,000 PR plasma units were transfused in Italy. the highest proportion of PR plasma is SD treated. in 2017, the probability of an infected donation for HBV was 1/1.6 million donations, for HCV 1/5 million donations, and for HIV 1/1.1 million donations. the proportion of TTBI was 0.09% (2 notifications in 2007 and 2 notifications in 2011) and of TTVI 0.16% (overall, of the 7 notifications, 1 was classified as possible and 3 with demonstrated imputability excluded) Spain produced 250,985 units of PLTs of which 78,372 (31.2%) units had been PR using Intercept\u00ae (9,568; 12.2%) units and Mirasol\u00ae (68,804; 87.8%) units. 66% apply the system universally and 34% partially in 66% of BEs that are using the intercept\u00ae system. the decision to implement PR for PLTs in the national blood transfusion centre in Ljubljana had been endorsed in 2007. since 2009 PR of PLTs have been regularly produced in the Ljubljana blood centre. the remaining two blood establishments in Slovenia did not implement this technology. LTs in Sweden are increasing, from 39% of all PLTs in 2017 to 52% in 2018. a total of 7,202 units of PR plasma (Octaplas) were used in 2 regions. the centre is developing a procedure for PR of pooled plasma. emovigilance data showed no transfusion-transmitted infectious disease case had been detected. currently FDA-approved devices are intercept\u00ae blood system (IBS) for apheresis PLTs and plasma (derived from whole blood or collected by apheresis) the universal use of PRT has not been adopted. the FDA had previously granted a variance for PRT of apheresis PLTs in cases in which malaria risk factors are reported. ongoing studies in the u.s. are investigating the 7-day storage of apheresis PLTs. CHIKV diagnosis was based on the detection of the viral genome by real-time-PCR and virus-specific antibodies by serological tests on serum or plasma samples. testing for CHIKV was not considered for donors\u2019 screening since, at that time, CE-marked and validated tests were not available. the outbreak of CHIKV infection highlights the importance of an integrated surveillance system to promptly identify autochthonous transmission. in the 2000s, PRT for PLTs using the IBS was introduced for evaluation by the French National Blood Service in the French region of Alsace. IBS treated PLT concentrates issued from CHIKV or ZIKV NAT positive donors who had been issued for transfusion before final NAT release were investigated. in the summer of 2018, during the most important WNV circulation in France, the production of IBS-treated PLTs has been useful also for blood safety and blood supply management. is the mitigation of residual risk of TTI caused by a low infectious dose of pathogens currently tested in routine practice. this could be illustrated by the recent description of transfusion of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected blood donated during the HIV pre-ramp-up phase that was tested individual NAT negative due to a low viral load. in vitro cell quality of buffy coat platelets in additive solution treated with pathogen reduction technology. transfusion. 2010;50:2210\u20139. doi: 10.1111/j.1537-2995.2010.02681.x.

Transfusion of HIV-infected blood products. there is no legal requirement for the use of PRT during the processing of blood and blood components. more lenient testing requirements are defined for PR products. shelf life for PRT PLTs is prolonged to 7 days. implementation in the Belgian blood service was further hampered by the risk of aseptic breaches arising from perforation of PRT bag systems. observed operational consequences of PRT include increased operational complexity, adaptation of previous production steps, potential product loss, and generation of new risks. in the last decade, France has experienced 4\u20138 TTBIs per year (1 death every 2 years) in the last decade, France has experienced 4\u20138 TTBIs per year (1 death every 2 years) there were around 4.8 million blood components distributed annually with 4 confirmed TTIs (three bacterial and one viral) in 2016 and 7 TTIs (six bacterial and one viral) in 2017. such low rates result from the implemented NAT screening of donations for the presence of existing viruses like HIV, pre-donation sampling, and limiting PLT shelf life to 4 days. a large spread of TT malaria may result in the deferral of a large proportion of laboratory-positive donors. a large spread of WNV may result in the deferral of a large proportion of laboratory-positive donors. in situations of malaria and WNV outbreaks, PR for plasma and PLTs may also be considered. the high impact of malaria and WNV infection on blood supply in the affected areas indicates that PRT could be considered as a response intervention solution in such situations. in 2018, about 13,000 PR PLTs (5.77% of the total PLT concentrates transfused nationwide) have been transfused. in 2017, the probability of an infected donation for HBV was 1/1.6 million donations, for HCV 1/5 million donations, and for HIV 1/1.1 million donations. in recent years, several pathogens have been added to the list of potentially threatening agents: DENV, WNV, CHIKV, influenza A (H5N1) virus, HIV and HBV variants. most BEs have 20 years of experience in inactivating plasma with methylene blue. in 2018, Spain produced 250,985 units of PLTs of which 78,372 (31.2%) units had been PR using Intercept\u00ae (9,568; 12.2%) units and Mirasol\u00ae (68,804;87.8%) units. in 2018, there were 4 cases of WNV infection reported in Slovenia. the decision to implement PR for PLTs in the national blood transfusion centre in Ljubljana had been endorsed in 2007. the remaining two blood establishments in Slovenia did not implement this technology. the PR of PLTs in Sweden is increasing, from 39% of all PLTs in 2017 to 52% in 2018. in 2018, a total of 7,202 units of PR plasma (Octaplas) were used in 2 regions. the centre is developing a procedure for PR of pooled plasma. for PLTs was approved for use in Switzerland (Approval/Market Authorization of Intercept\u00ae) since summer 2011, all PLTs issued in Switzerland are PR. favourable safety profile of the Intercept\u00ae pathogen inactivation procedure has been introduced nationwide. the FDA had previously granted a variance for PRT of apheresis PLTs in cases in which malaria risk factors are reported. ongoing studies in the us are investigating the 7-day storage of apheresis PLTs. the largest focus, involving 317 persons with a direct link with the town of Anzio, occurred between week 26 and week 42. the other two foci occurred in people who lived in Rome and Latina and had no link with the area of Anzio. testing for CHIKV was not considered for donors\u2019 screening since CE-marked tests were not available. the national blood centre activated a national emergency blood supply plan. more than 2,500 red blood cell units were sent to the lazio region from other italian regions. the outbreak highlights the importance of an integrated surveillance system to promptly identify autochthonous transmission. IBS treated PLTs could be transfused without awaiting NAT results. CHIKV or ZIKV NAT testing performed on blood donors showed higher viral loads in symptomatic donors compared to asymptomatic ones39. TTBI caused by PLT concentrates has been reported. an additional benefit of PR methods is the mitigation of residual risk of TTI caused by a low infectious dose of pathogens currently tested in routine practice. this could be illustrated by the recent description of transfusion of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected blood donated during the HIV pre-ramp-up phase. in vitro cell quality of buffy coat platelets in additive solution treated with pathogen reduction technology. transfusion. 2010;50:2210\u20139. doi:10.1111/j.1537-2995.2010.02681.x. transfusion. 2019 doi: 10.1111/trf.15275.
