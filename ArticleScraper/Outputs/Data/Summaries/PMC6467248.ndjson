{"summary": "230 cases and 230 controls were enrolled from may 2015 to October 2017. at least one respiratory virus was identified in 57% of cases and 29% of controls. Icoplasma pneumoniae was the only bacteria associated with pneumonia. respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae contribute to pneumonia in children. pneumonia remains a leading cause of hospitalisation and death among children worldwide with nearly 120 million new cases and one million deaths annually. few pneumonia aetiology studies from high-income settings have reported the exact contribution of pathogens to childhood pneumonia. but their findings are unlikely to be generalisable to settings with better vaccine coverage. controls were enrolled concurrently with cases throughout the study period. the target enrolment in each age group was matched to the number of cases enrolled in the preceding 2 weeks. oVHKU1 and HCoVNL63 and 6 bacteria (S. pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella catarrhalis, H. influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae) were detected using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). an equal number of contemporaneous healthy controls were enrolled. children attending clinic with respiratory symptoms, following recent respiratory illnesses or those previously enrolled as a case or control were not eligible. syncytial virus (RSV), human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) type 1\u20133, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), adenovirus, rhinovirus (RV), human coronavirus (HCoV) types HCoVOC43, HCoV229E, HCoVHKU1 and HCoVNL63 and 6 bacteria (S. pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella catar a higher proportion of cases were Aboriginal, born premature and reported a smoker in the household (p0.001 for each) the proportion of respondents 5 years attending day care was 59.1% among cases (n=87) and 36.6% among controls (n=66) the median days of attendance per week for cases was 3 days (IQR: 2\u20134) and for controls was 2 days (IQR: 2\u20133). more cases than controls had antibiotics in the 7 days prior enrolment. any comorbidity 34 (14.7) 10 (4.3) 44 (9.5) Immunodeficiency 7 (3.0) 1 (0.4) 8 (1.7) Immunocompromised condition 5 (2.1) 0 (0.0) 5 (1.1) Congenital chromosomal abnormality 16 (6.9) 4 (1.7) 20 (4.3) Chronic respiratory illness 9 (3.9) 2 (0.8) 11 (2.3) Chronic neuromuscular disorder illness 9 (3.9) 2 (0.8) 11 (2.3) % (95% CI) Respiratory virus Influenza (any) 16 (6.9) 3 (1.3) 5.6 (1.6 to 19.6) 10.1 (1.8 to 57.1) 6.2 (2.5 to 9.7) Influenza A H1N1 4 (1.7) 1 (0.4) 4.0 (0.4 to 36.5) 23.1 (1.2 to 442.6) Influenza A H3 9 (3.9) 1 (0.4) 9.3 (1.1 to 74.2) 9.6 (0.7 to 119.7) Influenza B 3 at least one respiratory virus identified 130 (56.5) 66 (28.6) 3.2 (2.1 to 4.7) 4.7 (2.8 to 7.8) 44.4 (33.8 to 53.3) One virus 111 (48.2) 62 (26.9) Two or more viruses 19 (8.2) 4 (1.7) Bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae 59 (25.3) 61 (26.5) 0.9 (0.6 to 1.4) 0.6 (0.3 to 1.4) Haemophilus influenzae 75 (32.6) aOR 58.4 (95% CI: 15.6 to 217.5), 37.2 (95% CI: 7.8 to 177.7), 10.1 (95% CI: 1.8 to 57.1) and 12.1 (95% CI: 1.4 to 104.4) none of the influenza-positive cases (n=16) or controls (n=3) had received influenza vaccine during the preceding influenza season. mycoplasma pneumoniae (Mp) included all children with community-acquired pneumonia (case group), by seasons, Perth, Western Australia, May 2015\u2013October 2017.

Detection of M. pneumoniae in the nasopharynx is reported in asymptomatic children. there are conflicting and inconclusive reports on appropriate treatment for M. pneumoniae. nasopharyngeal aspirates, nose/throat swabs and nose/throat swabs are available in our setting but not mandated by our protocol. testing control children without pneumonia enabled us to have a better estimation on contribution to pneumonia at the population level. respiratory viruses are a major contributor to childhood pneumonia. this is the most comprehensive study that described contribution of respiratory pathogens to childhood pneumonia in australia to date."}
