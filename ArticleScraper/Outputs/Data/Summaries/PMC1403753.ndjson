{"summary": "more than 700 million people (including visitors on business or personal/family trips) traverse nation-state borders annually [2,3] and one million per week move between the global South and the global North [4]. transnational migration for settlement in a new country increased more than twice as rapidly as the world's population grew during the last third of the Twentieth Century [6]. people on the move can either \"introduce new or previously eradicated diseases to the region of destination\" recent examples include the rapid transcontinental transmission of SARS, the spread of the polio virus from northern Nigeria to Indonesia, and the threat of an avian influenza pandemic [22]. preparing physicians for cross-national medical encounters offers a change strategy that is proactive. medical-school education holds out the promise of contributing to the reduction of health disparities in an immediate and observable fashion. the multidimensional richness of human experience generates considerable intragroup variation [36,37] 'Chinese' could have been born in the united states, be a college professor. this man could also be a monolingual Chinese gentleman, born in the united states, unmarried, and living alone in Chinatown in New York, with little education and very poor. disparities in health status reflect coping practices that are mediated by socio-economic position and ability to access and use health-care opportunities. health problems of displaced and otherwise dislocated people tend to be officially \"invisible\" and likely to be bypassed by potentially beneficial interventions. the vulnerability of irregular migrants is exacerbated by poverty, powerlessness, the absence of social and legal protection, and lack of access to reliable health-care services. consultations enable public-health professionals to identify specific resources and support. support for disadvantaged and underserved patients include facilitating access to social and health services provided by the host society. the transnational competence framework provides a valuable skill foundation for curriculum reform. TC approaches transnational clinical encounters as micro-level interpersonal interactions that occur in a social/power context and are directly and indirectly shaped by macrolevel (global, regional, national, and local) structural factors. medical students are expected to address the social and power context, and to promote the health rights, of patients undergoing spatial, social, and identity transitions. TC's second core principle holds that patient advocacy is an indispensable physician activity. a TC education aims to move learners beyond patient sensitivity into responsiveness to patient needs. a third TC principle centers on the resilience of underserved patients and families. medical students must develop expanded receptors for discerning political and socio-economic determinants of individual health. a patient's capacity for self-care can be limited by ongoing isolation, fragmentation of the family, deformation of social relationships, poverty, prejudice, and unemployment. a patient's capacity for self-care can be limited by ongoing \"cultural and linguistic isolation\" TC education prepares students to assess the role of nonbiomedical considerations in pre- and post-migration explanatory model and decision-making processes of specific patients and/or families. illustrative TC-preparation components: Analytic domain 1 presents illustrative TC-preparation components in the analytic domain. potentially influential post-migration conditions include: social/political experiences and stressors ii. simultaneous and potentially conflicting home- and host-country expectations and medical treatments iii. potentially influential post-migration conditions include: social/political experiences and stressors ii. transnational emotional skills include ability to express interest in different cultural patterns. ability to express interest in different cultural patterns, beliefs, traditions, experiences, challenges, preferred communication styles, and feelings of satisfaction and emotional distress stemming from social circumstances. the emotional-competence domain of a TC education further emphasizes appreciation for the ability of people in spatial transition to regain emotional strength and functional capacity following adversity [130], p.27, [110] a sense of personal, family, and/or group efficacy constitutes a powerful determinant of the adoption and maintenance of health-promoting actions. box 2 presents illustrative TC-preparation components in the emotional-skill domain. develop abilities to realize health-care insights through transnational empathy. develop ability to reinforce/restore efficacy among ethnically and socio-economically diverse patients. a substantial proportion of all health care is provided \"outside the perimeter of the formal health care system\" in the migrant-health arena, innovative approaches to managing demands for medical treatment and wellness promotion include complementary integration of biomedical and ethnocultural explanatory frameworks. medical practitioners must be prepared to relate physical and emotional experiences that shaped the decision to leave the country of origin. transnational communicative facility Effective provider-patient communication is widely perceived as \"a core competency in the health care profession\" in transnational medical interactions, interview pace, speech-simplification strategies ensure that participants are not rushed, prematurely interrupted, ignored, or incompletely understood [168-170,164]. box 4 presents illustrative TC-preparation components in the communicative-skill domain. a prerequisite for negotiating appropriate treatment plans and commitment to agreements is that participants are comfortable expressing serious doubts and constructive challenges [168,63,58]. migrant migrants lack voice in socio-political context they find themselves in. transnational functional adroitness necessitates advocacy competence. transculturally sustainable agreements must include involvement by family members and/or migrant-community support networks. box 5 presents illustrative TC-preparation components in the functional domain. ability to relate to ethnoculturally and socio-economically discordant patients in a way that builds mutual trust. ability to integrate evidence-based insights regarding the influence of ethnocultural practices and disease predispositions. taught in a way that works better, the core elements of a TC education need to be longitudinally woven into required pre-clinical and clinical education. the longitudinal and integrated TC approach would establish the need for adaptable skills in the contemporary context of globalization and health. resources from the humanities can be especially useful in the initial effort to awaken the student's imagination. a TC-informed medical education would constitute an integral part of all clinical clerkships. skill development is expected to be especially robust during the student's clinical-clerkship experiences. a TC-informed medical education would constitute an integral part of all clinical clerkships. a TC-informed medical education would constitute an integral part of all clinical clerkships. TC clinical placements and preceptor-supervised encounters with patients [121] would avoid focusing on a single local population. TC clerkships would emphasize the validation and promotion of factors that facilitate health recovery/maintenance, transnational adaptation, and survival. the bases for resilience vary among patients and are subject to change over time [189] a central component of inductive TC pedagogy and the TC clinical clerkship is a \"mini ethnography\" of health, illness, and migration/adaptation experiences. the ethnographic approach reduces prospects that decisions will be based on stereotypic oversimplifications and/or insufficient information. the TC approach involves explicit expectations that students act as the patient's advocate by forging partnerships with community organizations and advocacy groups. the approach involves explicit expectations that students act as the patient's advocate by forging partnerships with community organizations and advocacy groups. a TC educational initiative requires additional resources. the training and employment of medical interpreters, ethnographic interviews and the professional development of medical-school faculty. a variety of national and international funding sources can be mobilized for program support. [64] preparation for the TC encounter revolves around patient-oriented inquiries that are designed to promote congruent perspectives among care seekers and care providers on health status and health promotion. the TC approach anticipates that health-care outcomes will be enhanced when patients also possess transnational competence [75] and demand and inspire corresponding skills on the part of the clinicians who consult with them. TC education recognizes the necessity to probe beyond ethnicity/culture. the interweaving of ethnocultural, socio-political, and medical analyses is required for comprehensive assessment. medical students must develop expanded receptors for discerning political and socio-economic determinants of individual health. transnational analytic skill further involves unraveling existing linkages between migrant health and post-migration constraints and stressors associated with receiving-country reception practices. a patient's capacity for self-care can be limited by ongoing \"cultural and linguistic isolation, fragmentation of the family, deformation of social relationships, chronic absence of adequate support systems, poverty, prejudice, and unemployment\" a patient's capacity for self-care can be limited by ongoing \"cultural and linguistic isolation, fragmentation of the family, ii. process of distancing; that is, stretching the chain (geographically, culturally, and mentally) iii. possible applications when analyzing transnational health care 1. recognize the need to move upstream and downstream in the effort to uncover specific case-relevant contextual social forces and power relations. x. extent, and positive and negative effects, of adaptation [31] d. Connect concepts to skill in discerning life-style and health consequences of the patient's changing class profile. develop ability to discern patient's ethnocultural identification(s) and personal (including nonbiomedical) beliefs and practices. learn to avoid the \"cultural blind spot syndrome\" where clinician assumes no distinctive health-care beliefs/practices exist. a. introduce useful concepts from waste and consumption studies. recognize the need to move upstream and downstream along the health chain. recognize that moving upstream and downstream intergenerationally is likely to yield divergent as well as overlapping insights. potentially influential post-migration conditions include: social/political experiences and stressors ii. simultaneous and potentially conflicting home- and host-country expectations and medical treatments iii. altered nutrition practices v. immigration status vi. occupational and employment transitions vii.literacy and education viii. housing & transportation situation ix. (lack of) support networks x. extent, and positive and negative effects, of adaptation [31] d. Connect concepts to skill in discerning life- transnational emotional skills require a \"willingness to try\" to decipher the patient's thoughts and perspectives. migrant-health interface requires a \"willingness to try\" to respond empathically with an appropriate emotion of one's own. a sense of personal, family, and/or group efficacy constitutes a powerful determinant of the adoption and maintenance of health-promoting actions. a sense of personal, family, and/or group efficacy constitutes a powerful determinant of the adoption and maintenance of health-promoting actions. a sense of personal, family, and/or group efficacy constitutes a powerful determinant of the adoption and maintenance of health-promoting actions. demonstrating appreciation for emotional resources (resilience) and achievements in surviving and overcoming dislocation and migration challenges and/or disparities in treatment [115,139] b. by validating and protecting family-care and self-care practices that facilitate adaptation and well-being [140] c. by identifying what patients and their support network can do for themselves with some initial outside help [141] d. a key creative skill for medical students preparing for migrant-health care is the ability to initiate fruitful new connections among distant and proximate parts of the patient's experience. a substantial proportion of all health care is provided \"outside the perimeter of the formal health care system\" a substantial proportion of all health care is provided \"outside the perimeter of the formal health care system\" box 3 presents illustrative TC-preparation components in the creative/innovative domain. illustrative TC-preparation components: Creative domain 1. Ability to account for the patient's current place-specific environment (housing, social dis/organization, transportation, employment, etc.) in the tailored health-action plan. biomedical and personal beliefs/practices are neither clinically, culturally, nor economically contraindicated. ability to activate and incorporate the patient's own ideas, suggestions, resources, and ingenuity in the mutually agreed-upon health-action plan. transnational communicative facility Effective provider-patient communication is widely perceived as \"a core competency in the health care profession\" box 4 presents illustrative TC-preparation components in the communicative-skill domain. participants \u2013 especially migrant patients \u2013 are comfortable expressing serious doubts and constructive challenges [168,63,58] functional skills of both patients and clinicians affect illness management and wellness promotion. skills in establishing positive interpersonal relations are particularly valuable for the functional domain of migrant-health care. key to success in building fruitful transnational relationships include demonstrating genuine and sustained personal as well as professional interest in the care recipient as an individual. transnational functional adroitness necessitates advocacy competence. it is likely to be particularly rewarding for functional skill development to focus students' advocacy attention on local \"hot spots\" where migrants tend to congregate. box 5 presents illustrative TC-preparation components in the functional domain. Advocacy and referral skills I. Ability to build and activate host-society and migrant-community resources that are likely to enhance the patient's health situation. ability to mitiga the socio-economic inequities, power differentials, exclusion policies, and other institutionalized constraints they confront. a longitudinal and integrated TC approach would establish the need for adaptable skills in the contemporary context of globalization and health. resources from the humanities (e.g., art, literature, autobiographical accounts of migrant-patient experiences) can be especially useful in the initial effort to awaken the student's imagination and to convey TC concepts that are inherently important in caring for migrant patients. inductive TC approach focuses on the patient as the starting point for discovery and avoiding mistakes. skill development occurs through \"bottom-up\" information and evidence gathering. in a TC-informed medical education, exposure to transnational medical encounters would constitute an integral part of all clinical clerkships. TC clerkships would emphasize validation and promotion of factors that facilitate health recovery/maintenance, transnational adaptation, and survival. students would learn that unduly pathologizing the migrant's experience exaggerates deficiencies, risks fostering dependency, [191] and community mutual assistance and support [190] a central component of inductive TC pedagogy and the TC clinical clerkship is a \"mini ethnography\" of health, illness, and migration/adaptation experiences. the ethnographic-learning experience should include observations in the patient's social territory, critical reflection on the medical impact of power relations, institutionalized constraints, and patient/family strengths. the ethnographic-learning experience should include observations in the patient's social territory. ethnographic approach reduces prospects that decisions will be based on stereotypic oversimplifications and/or insufficient information. TC approach involves explicit expectations that students act as the patient's advocate by forging partnerships with community organizations and advocacy groups. TC's advocacy emphasis further suggests the value of integrating community-based experiential or service learning into the medical student's education [198] delineate and document a comprehensive plan of action that connects the patient's socio-cultural background, perspectives, and context with his/her current health challenges and promising medical and nonmedical responses. TC skill assessment would be incomplete without eliciting and incorporating patient reflections on the interview process, the accuracy of insights reported in the mini-ethnography, the efficacy of the student's proposed and initiated actions in terms of health-promoting interventions and personal health outcomes. a TC education would equip clinicians and other public-health professionals with the full complement of interpersonal skills needed to be effective care providers in the global North and the global South. the benefits of TC-inspired redirection of medical education are manifold. a full-blown TC curriculum would involve demanding expectations of currently stretched students and faculty. compelling evaluation results require additional outcome-based research studies, controls, and time, substantiating claims for the efficacy of TC education remains a future project. author declares that he has no competing interests."}
