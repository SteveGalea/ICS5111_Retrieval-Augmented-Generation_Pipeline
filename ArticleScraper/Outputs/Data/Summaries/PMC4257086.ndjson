{"summary": "DDX3 belongs to the DEAD (D-E-A-D: Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp)-box RNA helicase family. it is an ATPase-dependent RNA helicase, found in various organisms from yeast to human. DDX3 is ubiquitously expressed in most tissues, while the expression of DDX3Y protein is limited to the male germline. DDX3 down-regulates the p21waf1/cip1 promoter. he says DDX3 seems to contribute to splicing. he says DDX3 shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. he says DDX3 interacts with CRM1 and functions in human immunodeficiency virus. DDX3 localizes in cytoplasmic stress granules under stress conditions. DDX3 represses translation by trapping eIF4E in a translationally inactive complex to block an interaction with eIF4G. DDX3 may be dispensable for general mRNA translation. DDX3 is an essential factor in RNA interference (RNAi) pathway that cleaves target mRNA. it acts as an essential factor involved in RNAi pathway. it has been indicated a role of DDX3 in cell cycle regulation, apoptosis and tumorigenesis. diol epoxide (BPDE) present in tobacco smoke can promote growth, proliferation and neoplastic transformation of breast epithelial cells. DDX3 is recruited to the E-cadherin promoter and represses the E-cadherin expression resulting the increased cell migration and metastasis. DDX3 knockdown also reduces the expression of levels of both Rac1 and -catenin. hypoxia is a major characteristic of solid tumors and affects gene expression. DDX3 is aberrantly expressed in breast cancer cells ranging from weakly invasive to aggressive phenotypes. DDX3 expression is deregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma. loss of DDX3 by p53 inactivation promotes tumor malignancy via the MDM2/Slug/E-cadherin pathway. DDX3 also associates with p53, increases p53 accumulation, and positively regulates DNA damage-induced apoptosis. p21waf1/cip1 is considered to act as a tumor suppressor. DDX3 is required for several RNA viral replication such as HCV and HIV-1, while DDX3 restricts HBV replication. at least, DDX3 may be a therapeutic target for anti-viral drug against HCV and HIV-1. DDX3 was identified as an HCV core-binding protein by yeast two-hybrid screening. the interaction is mediated by the N-terminal 59 amino acid residues of HCV core. DDX3 and HCV core colocalized in distinct spots in the perinuclear region. the accumulation of both genome-length HCV RNA (HCV-O strain, genotype 1b; Ikeda et al., 2005) and its replicon RNA were significantly suppressed in the DDX3 knockdown cells. however, the specific interactions between DDX3 and HCV core remain unclear. of DDX3 in HCV infection involves aspects of the viral life cycle that vary in importance between HCV genotypes. DDX1 bound to both the HCV 3\u2032UTR and the HCV 5\u2032UTR caused a marked reduction in the replication of subgenomic replicon RNA. knockdown of DDX5 reduces HCV RNA production in the supernatant. microRNA miR122 and DDX6/Rck/p54 have been implicated in HCV replication. DDX6 regulates the activity of the decapping enzymes DCP1 and DCP2. HCV (JFH1) infection disrupts the P-body formation of DDX3, DDX6, Lsm1, Xrn1, PATL1 and Ago2 and dynamically redistributes them to the HCV production site around LDs. recent studies suggest that DDX3 is also required for WNV, Japanese encephalitis virus, norovirus, and pestivirus. DDX3 has been proposed to be a tumor suppressor. it inhibits colony formation in various cell lines. DDX3 up-regulates the p21waf1/cip1 promoter. DDX3 is ESSENTIAL FOR HIV-1 REPLICATION. DDX3 was first found to involve in the Rev-dependent nuclear export of unspliced and partially spliced HIV-1 RNAs. DDX3 or expression of dominant negative mutant of DDX3 significantly suppressed the Rev function as well as HIV-1 replication. DDX3 is a nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling protein, which binds CRM1 and localizes to nuclear membrane pores. DDX3 interacts with HIV-1 Rev and facilitates the translation of HIV-1 mRNA. helicase A (RHA) synergistically facilitates the Rev-dependent nuclear export function. DDX3 interacts with DDX5 and synergistically enhances the Rev-dependent nuclear export function. HIV-1 Tat activates the HIV-1 RNA synthesis. Tat is partially targeted to cytoplasmic stress granules upon DDX3 overexpression or cell stress conditions, suggesting a potential role of Tat/DDX3 complex in translation. DDX3 directly binds to the HIV-1 5\u2032UTR and interacts with eIF4G and PABP but lacking the major cap-binding proteins eIF4E in large cytoplasmic RNA granules. genome of 3.2 kb replicates its DNA genome via reverse transcription. DDX3 specifically binds to the HBV Pol and is incorporated into nucleocapsid together with HBV Pol. IRF-3 is phosphorylated by IKK and TBK1. the phosphorylated IRF-3 then homodimerizes and translocates into the nucleus. these IFNs activate the JAK-STAT pathway to induce the IFN-stimulated genes. DDX3 was recently reported to be a component of anti-viral innate immune signaling pathway leading to type I IFN. DDX3 up-regulates the IFN- induction through an interaction with IKK. both IKK and TBK1 are IRF-3-activating kinase to leading NF-B and IFN induction. DDX3 is recruited on the IFN promoter and enhances the IFN production. in contrast, HCV core, HBV Pol, or vaccinia virus K7 interacts with DDX3 and suppresses the IFN induction. DDX3 is known to bind to HBV Pol and restrict the HBV replication. viruses must target DDX3 and evolve mechanisms to overcome this host immune system. RNA viruses sequester and utilize DDX3 for their viral replication."}
