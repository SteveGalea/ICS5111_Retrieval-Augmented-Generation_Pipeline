{"summary": "infectious disease outbreaks have plagued mankind for centuries. there have been tremendous strides in the control of communicable diseases in modern times. however, other changes have concurrently increased the potential for disease development and epidemic or even pandemic spread. public health risk communication during an infectious disease outbreak is dependent on people being able to access information that is understandable, reliable and meets their needs. learning from past outbreaks, and trends between outbreaks, provides an invaluable opportunity to improve performance and mitigate impacts of future outbreaks. a person presenting after 1 November 2002 with history of high fever (>38\u00b0C) AND cough or breathing difficulty AND one or more of the following exposures during to 10 days prior to onset of symptoms a. close contact with a person who is a suspect or probable case of SARS b. history of travel, to an area with recent local transmission of SARS c. residing in an area with recent local transmission of SARS Probable case 1. A suspect case with radiographic evidence of infiltrate the outbreak, originally called'swine flu', began in Mexico in march 2009. it was first reported in Canada on April 26, 2009. a phase 6 pandemic indicates that the same identified virus has caused sustained outbreaks in two or more countries in one region and in at least one other country in another WHO region. internet based sources of information were found to conflictingly provide both \u2018trustworthy information\u2019 (e.g. from public health agencies) and more biased points of view. social networking was thought to be widely used as an information source during the H1N1 outbreak and subsequent vaccination program. new media channels are being used by information seekers to increase use of older forms of media such as tv, newspapers and radio. the use of the Internet as a complementary source of health information has also been shown to be more prevalent amongst younger adults than older adults. a person presenting after 1 November 2002 with history of high fever (>38\u00b0C) AND cough or breathing difficulty AND one or more of the following exposures during to 10 days prior to onset of symptoms a. close contact with a person who is a suspect or probable case of SARS b. history of travel, to an area with recent local transmission of SARS c. residing in an area with recent local transmission of SARS Probable case 1. A suspect case with radiographic evidence of infiltrate the outbreak, originally called'swine flu', is believed to have begun in Mexico in march 2009. it was first reported in Canada on April 26, 2009. on June 11, 2009, the world health organization (WHO) declared the outbreak to be a Phase 6 global influenza pandemic. internet based sources of information were found to conflictingly provide both \u2018trustworthy information\u2019 (e.g. from public health agencies) and more biased points of view. online information may have contributed to greater stress and hysteria during SARS. new media channels are being used by information seekers to augment the use of older forms of media such as television, newspapers and radio. the use of the Internet as a complementary source of health information has also been shown to be more prevalent amongst younger adults than older adults. a representative sample of Albertans was accessed through the Population Research Laboratory at the University of Alberta. the target population were those 18 years and older who could be contacted by landline household telephones. participants were recruited using a Random-digit Dialling approach to ensure that residents had an equal chance to be contacted whether or not their household was listed in a telephone directory. ethical approval for was obtained from the University of Alberta Faculty of Agriculture, Forestry and Home Economics Research Ethics Board (SARS survey) participants provided oral consent after being read an explanation of the survey, their rights as participants, and an assurance of confidentiality. participants were also provided with a name and toll free number to contact if they required further information. respondents were asked to rank the same information sources based on usefulness and perceived credibility of the information, again using a five point scale. the data was tabulated and analysed using SPSS for Windows statistical package version 18. 80% of households comprised solely of people aged 55 and over had at least one landline, compared with 56% of households comprised of people aged 54 and under. a 2008 survey showed that younger households were much more likely to use only a cell phone; 34.4% of households comprised solely of adults aged between 18 and 34 relied exclusively on cell phones. among all other households the rate was 4.5%. 7.0 36.7 29.2 10.4 n/a n/a $40,000\u2014$69,999 25.3 26.6 25.5 20.1 n/a $70,000\u2014$99,999 21.6 17.3 19.1 17.0 n/a n/a $100,000+ 26.1 19.4 26.2 52.4 n/a n/a n/a * Weighted against the SARS 2004 results for age and education a Due to changes in the information collected in the Canadian census in 2011, education and income household income distribution of the SARS 2004 sample deviates significantly from the Canadian population. a higher percentage of respondents with household income of $70,000 or more, and a lower percentage of respondents with household income below $70,000. however, household income distribution of the SARS 2004 sample does not deviate significantly from the Albertan population.
