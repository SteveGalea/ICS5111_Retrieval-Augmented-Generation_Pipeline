{"summary": "MERS-CoV is a recently identified betacoronavirus that can infect the lower respiratory airway of humans. disease symptoms associated with MERS-CoV are similar to those of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) however, MERS-CoV is phylogenetically more closely related to the bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5 (2, 3) HEK 293T cells were transfected with 3 g of the indicated DPP4 expression plasmid. cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 with a recombinant MERS-CoV strain designed to express tomato red fluorescent protein (rMERS-CoV-red) the rMERS-CoV-red virus is derived from the EMC2012 substrain. HEK 293T cells were transfected with 3 g of plasmid expressing human DPP4 (hDPP4) or hDPP4-Venus fusion (A) and mDPP4-venus fusion (B) at 20 h posttransfection, cells were infected with rMERS-CoV-red virus at an MOI of 5. the recently published crystal structures of the MERS spike protein interacting with hDPP4 revealed specific amino acids in blades IV and V of the -propeller domain from hDPP4 that may facilitate an interaction with the spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) 9, 10. hDPP4 and mDPP4 sequences in this region exhibits amino acid variation that may account for differences in MERS-CoV susceptibility. vector NTI protein sequence alignment of human (top strand) and mouse (bottom strand) DPP4 molecules. yellow highlighted regions indicate conserved amino acids, white regions indicate amino acids that are functionally different. green highlighting indicates amino acids that are functionally different (i.e., hydrophobic and hydrophilic) hek 293T cells were transfected with the indicated chDPP4 constructs. a chDPP4 molecule containing all five mutations (p282T A288L R289I T330R V340I) promoted highly efficient MERS-CoV infection. chDPP4 mutants with the T330R mutation exhibit a shift from a doublet to a single lower-molecular-weight band, potentially indicating glycosylation at this site. chDPP4 mutants with the T330R mutation exhibit a shift from a doublet to a single lower-molecular-weight band, potentially indicating glycosylation at this site. phylogenetic analyses indicate that mouse, bat, and ferret DPP4s are highly divergent from primate DPP4s (4, 5), despite the capacity of bat DPP4 to serve as a functional receptor for MERS-CoV infection. swapping the hDPP4 region containing blades IV and V of the -propeller into the ferret DPP4 resulted in a gain of infection. values were normalized to an MOI of 0.1 and expressed as relative infection at 0.1. human DPP4, chDPP4 P282T A288L R289I T330R V340I, and chDPP4 A288L T330R showed a significant increase in infection over mDPP4 (*, P 0.05, Student's t test) escence microscopy."}
