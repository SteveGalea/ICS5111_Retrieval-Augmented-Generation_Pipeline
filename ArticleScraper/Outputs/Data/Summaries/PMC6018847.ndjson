{"summary": "transport of livestock is an integral part of farming. many factors factor into transportation stress to include transport management, climatic factors (temperature, humidity, gases and so on), handling methods and facilities, feed and water deprivation. Bangladesh is a tropical country where temperature (average 30\u00b0C\u201340\u00b0C) and humidity (average 60\u201385 per cent) become higher during the summer season. most days are very hot and the UV exposure is high. animal transporters attempt to move animals under adverse weather conditions. between 20,000 and 25,000 cattle are legally or illegally imported each day from India to Bangladesh. this market is the largest of its kind in the south-western region of Bangladesh. on any given haat day, around 15,000\u201320,000 cattle are kept on the market, while nearly 10,000 cattle are sold. the average environmental temperature and humidity were 31\u00b0C\u201333\u00b0C and 84\u201389 per cent during the day, and 26\u00b0C\u201329\u00b0C and 78\u201384 per cent during the night. the space allocation for each animal in the vehicle was 8\u201310 square feet on average per animal. the animals were transported without any bedding materials. animal transportation usually started at 18:00 from the source market and reached the destination market the following day at about 06:00\u201310:00. data collection A structured questionnaire was designed in relation to the targeted objectives of the study. animals were assessed closely by the first author of the manuscript twice (at the initial location and at the destination market) blood samples, 6 ml per animal, were collected from the jugular veins of the animals and placed in two separate vials. one containing EDTA for haematological evaluation and one having no EDTA for biochemical and hormonal evaluation. blood samples without anticoagulant were centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 10 minutes to separate the serum samples. data analysis All collected data and laboratory data were entered into Microsoft Excel 2007. data were then exported to the Statistical Package for the social sciences V.16 (SPSS V.16) software for statistical analysis. between 20,000 and 25,000 cattle are legally or illegally imported each day from India to Bangladesh. the market is the largest of its kind in the south-western region of Bangladesh. the usual size for trading in this market during the peak season has been estimated to be 15,000\u201320,000 per day. each trip using one single truck was made at 15-day intervals. the authors travelled by public transport each time in parallel with the selected cattle vehicle from the market of origin to the market of destination. the average environmental temperature and humidity were 31\u00b0C\u201333\u00b0C and 84\u201389 per cent during the day. adult cattle, age two years or older, irrespective of breed and sex (mostly male) were selected for assessing health conditions (nasal discharge, diarrhoea and dehydration) and physical injuries before and after transportation. blood samples were taken from 50 randomly selected cattle for haemato-biochemical evaluation at three time phases. blood samples from selected animals were collected at the market of source (at 0 hour) and at the market of destination (immediately after arrival and then again 24 hours after arrival at the destination market) each vial contained 3 ml of the blood sample. blood samples without anticoagulant were centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 10 minutes to separate the serum samples. Hormonal analysis The cortisol hormone was determined using an ELISA-based technique using the commercial kit of Monobind with its protocol. blood samples with anticoagulant were analysed for haemoglobin (Hb), PCV, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, total leucocyte count (TLC), total erythrocyte count (TEC) and differential leucocyte count (DLC) as per the protocol described or developed by Weiss and Wardrop. results Approximately 13.80.9 (12\u201316) hours were required to transport animals from the market of origin (Benapole LCM) to the market of destination (Sagorika LCM) by road (truck) six different types of injury were recorded in the studied animals. the overall frequency of injuries increased after transportation, but single-type injury significantly increased after transportation (P0.001). the difference was not significant (Table 3). clinical assessment of animals There was a significant difference (P=0.03) between the incidence of nasal discharge before and after transportation (15 per cent v 28%) dehydration, by category, significantly differed before and after transportation (P0.001) the PCV, monocyte count and basophil count showed no variations. aNOVA, analysis of variance; L:N, lymphocyte and neutrophil ratio. serum TP, ALP, CK and TG were significantly higher in animals immediately after reaching the destination market than in animals at the market of origin. however, the values of TP, ALP, CK and TG returned to the original values after 24 hours of arrival at the destination market. 104.733.4a 127.737.2b 116.347.5a 0.04 cortisol g/dl* 4.02.6 4.82.6 \u2013 0.16 Means with different superscripts in the same row differ significantly (P0.05). the value of serum cortisol remained unchanged before and after transportation (t test P=0.16). abrasion on the hip bone, abrasion on the thigh, abrasion on pin bone and tail, abrasion on the paralumbar fossa, swelling on the back, barbed wire injury on the shoulder, laceration on the ear, scarification on the tail and l) horn fracture. dehydration, by category, also significantly differed before and after transportation. haematological changes The levels of Hb (P=0.01), TEC (P=0.001), TLC (P0.001), lymphocyte (P=0.005), neutrophil (P=0.01) and the lymphocyte and neutrophil (L:N) ratio (P=0.006) significantly varied before and after transportation. erythrocyte count (106/l) 4.71.6a 5.71.2b 4.51.0a 0.001 Total leucocyte count (103/l) 6.21.5b 7.31.3c 5.30.3a 0.001 Lymphocyte (%) 61.74.5b 58.13.8a 60.64.8b 0.005 Monocyte (%) 4.81.6 4.32.4 4.21.8 0.18 Neutrophil (%) 29.73.9a 32.84.5b 30.24.6a 0.01 Basophil (%) 0.10.3 the value of serum cortisol remained unchanged before and after transportation (t test P=0.16). the value of serum cortisol remained unchanged before and after transportation (t test P=0.16) in the present study, the most common injuries in the cattle at the market of origin were abrasion (11 per cent), barbed wire injury (9 per cent) and scarification (6 per cent). this could be due to the cattle already having travelled a long distance (such as from India) to reach the market of origin. the high stocking density of cattle in the vehicle during transportation may have contributed to the increase in the frequency of severe injuries during transportation. the feeding of low-quality forages was also documented in the market of destination in the current study where the cattle were fed only with paddy straw and drinking water. this deprivation from nutritional needs also hinders animal welfare. elevations of Hb by 9.8 per cent (11.1 mg/dl before and 12.3 mg/dl after) and TEC by 17.5% (4.7106/l to 5.7106/l) in the cattle after transportation indicate haemoconcentration, which could be due to the effect of diarrhoea and dehydration during transportation. the increase of neutrophil count in this study may be a proportionate increase that may be a result of lymphopenia. the reactivation of adrenergic receptor due to elapsed time could be due to short-distance transportation. the referred studies determined 7.2\u20137.9 mg/dl TP, 1220\u20131800 U/l CK and 105\u2013120 mg/dl TG after transportation. the estimated level of these biochemical parameters could have occurred due to different mechanisms: promotion of protein metabolism by increased level T3 secretion during transportation. the concentrations of cortisol insignificantly increased after transportation (4 g/dl before to 4.8 g/dl after) in the present study. this particular trend could be explained by the variable duration of transportation time. as information on the breed and sex of the animals was not recorded, a limitation is that the authors do not know if and how these factors influenced the findings of the study. a limitation is that the authors do not know if and how these factors influenced the findings. provision of quality feed and water should be ensured during long-distance transportation to prevent incidence of different types of cattle injuries, respiratory problem, diarrhoea, dehydration, immune-suppression, and detrimental haemato-biochemical and hormonal changes."}
