{"summary": "a pilot study is conducted to exploit the genetic diversity and population structure of the snow leopard in this selected natural habitat of the member of the wildcat family in Pakistan. the pilot study is conducted to exploit the genetic diversity and population structure of the snow leopard in this selected natural habitat. it is considered an indicator of the health of the ecosystem (O\u2019Brien et al., 1985) and an icon of conservation (Bonin et al., 2004). its population in Pakistan has remained constant for the last few years it still needs conservational efforts for its future survival. the number of snow leopard individuals is 7,463\u20137,980 worldwide. the number of snow leopard individuals is 7,463\u20137,980 worldwide. studies conducted on snow leopard populations in central and south\u2013east Asian region. each sample was packed separately in centrifuge tubes (50 mL) having silica gel to avoid desiccation, labeled and brought to the laboratory. samples were then processed for DNA extraction without any delay to obtain good quality of gDNA. GAGC was used to amplify the highly conserved mitochondrial gene, cytochrome c oxidase I (COI), region of extracted gDNA. a male snow leopard scat sample was provided by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Wildlife Department (Pakistan) DNA extraction Genomic DNA was extracted from scat samples using three protocols: Zhang Method: Sample was washed with ethanol, purified by phenol and gDNA was isolated by binding buffer and column filter. extracted gDNA was visualized on 1% agarose gel (Sambrook, Fritsch & Maniatis, 1989) amplified products were visualized on 2% agarose gel. bivariate data was generated on the basis of pattern of bands. results DNA extraction and identification Combined Zhang\u2013Phenol\u2013Chloroform method was efficient. study could amplify 25 samples out of 33 confirmed snow leopard scat samples at annealing temperature of 55 \u00b0C for 40 cycles using seven SSR markers. maximum number (14) of alleles was identified for PUN225 locus and the minimum (6) for PUN82 locus. allele frequencies of different SSR loci ranged between 0.02 and 0.75 in different populations. allele frequencies of different SSR loci ranged between 0.02 and 0.75. 169 0.31 0.17 1.18 PUN132 0.56 0.63 0.15 1.33 Mean 0.38 0.46 0.13 1.65 Table 6.

Maximum number (14) of alleles was identified for PUN225 locus and the minimum (6) for PUN82 locus. new tab Observed heterozygosity (analyzed on PopGen) was lower compared to expected heterozygosity. gene flow (Nm) reflected high level of gene flow (average 1.65: range 1.18\u20133.87 for different loci) between populations. thang population exhibited one degree separation from the above three populations, while Basho population appeared as a separate clade. Variance contributed by variability was 46% among individuals and that within individuals was 54%, while 0% was observed among populations. female leopards are more vulnerable to mortality factors during post-parturition. the vulnerability of female leopards to mortality factors increases. the lack of amplification in other samples could be due to inhibitors. low genetic variation/heterozygosity was observed in snow leopard population of GB compared to the expected value (0.62\u20130.75) low heterozygosity has been reported previously for many populations of snow leopards in central Asia including southern Mongolia, central China, Nepal, north-western India, Pakistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. allele frequency on different SSR markers at different loci analyzed by POP Gen for snow leopard populations. click here for additional data file."}
