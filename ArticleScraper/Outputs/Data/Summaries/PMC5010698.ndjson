{"summary": "genetic determinants of virulence are likely to contribute to differences in in vivo phenotype of FHV-1 isolates. this study used next generation sequencing to compare genomes of contemporary Australian clinical isolates of FHV-1, vaccine isolates and historical clinical isolates. recombination detected in the FHV-1 genomes suggests that the risk of attenuated vaccines recombining to generate virulent field viruses is lower than has been suggested for some other herpesviruses."}
