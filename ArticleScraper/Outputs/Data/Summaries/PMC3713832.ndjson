{"summary": "pharyngeal and anal swab specimens of 414 insectivorous bats were pooled and then processed with a viral particle\u2013protected nucleic acid purification method. the amplified viral nucleic acid libraries of the bat species were then sequenced with the Illumina/Solexa GAII sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) the overall nucleotide sequences between Bat Rp-coronavirus/Shaanxi2011 and Bat Cp-coronavirus/Yunnan2011 indicated 88.7% nt identity. the overall nucleotide sequences between Bat Rp-coronavirus/Shaanxi2011 and Bat Cp-coronavirus/Yunnan2011 indicated 88.7% nt identity. we used the MUSCLE package and default parameters to construct the alignment. the best substitution model was then evaluated with the Model Selection package implemented in MEGA5. we constructed a phylogenetic tree based on the nucleotide sequences of the RdRp gene to show the evolutionary relationship between these 2 betacoronaviruses and other CoVs. coronaviruses (CoVs) and GenBank accession numbers were used. the following coronaviruses (CoVs) and GenBank accession numbers were used. scotophilus bat CoV 512 (BtCoV-512; NC009657), avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV; NC001451), beluga whale CoV SW1 (BWCoV; NC010646). the spike proteins of CoVs are responsible for receptor binding and host species adaptation. their genes therefore constitute one of the most variable regions within CoV genomes (10,11) phylogenetic tree of novel betacoronaviruses based on the deduced amino acid sequence of spike protein. HCoV, human CoV; BtCoV, bat CoV; BWCoV, beluga whale CoV; IBV, avian infectious bronchitis. the close genetic relationship between the CoVs (SARS-like CoVs and SARS-CoVs) that we analyzed showed little genetic similarity with human betacoronaviruses and HCoV-EMC."}
