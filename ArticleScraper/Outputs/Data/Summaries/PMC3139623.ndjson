{"summary": "CHIKV (family Togaviridae, genus Alphavirus) causes acute febrile illness associated with severe joint pain that can persist for a long time even after viral clearance. it is regarded as a potential worldwide public health problem with no preventive or therapeutic means available. CHIKV nsP2 helicase belongs to the superfamily 1 (SF1) and shows seven conserved signature motifs which form the core of the enzyme. helicase and RNA-dependent 5\u2032-RNA phosphatase activities have been located in the N-terminus of the protein. truncated CHIKV nsP2 (166\u2013630 a.a. of nsP2, 465 amino acids) was expressed as a fusion protein with N-terminal Maltose-binding protein in bacterial expression system. protein was further purified by gel filtration chromatography using native buffer system. two mutants of the CHIKV nsP2 (nsP2 mut I and nsP2 mut II) were generated by site directed mutagenesis. these proteins were also expressed as MBP tagged proteins in E.coli. both proteins showed same sized bands on SDS-PAGE similar to wild type protein.

ATP showed 80% inhibition of RTPase, activity indicating that ATP and RNA shared the substrate binding site. ATP and AMP did not affect the RTPase activity even at 5 mM concentration. released radiolabel [32Pi] was quantitated for three independent experiments. reactions were carried out in presence of different concentrations of MgCl2. mutations in the Walker A motif, nsP2 mut II resulted in significant loss of ATPase activity. expression and purification of CHIKV-nsP2T and its mutants were similar. different motifs of the enzymes were identified in the same way using amino acid alignments. 2T, (2) nsP2T-mut I, (3) nsP2T-mut II, (MW) Molecular weight marker. proteins were also confirmed by western blot analysis using anti-MBP antibodies. ATPase activity of CHIKV-nsP2T NTP hydrolysis is known to provide energy. the ATPase activity of the CHIKV-nsP2T was quantified using a colorimetric assay that measures the total amount of orthophosphate released. the assays were performed in 50 l reaction volumes, using standard 96-well plate. there was a gradual increase in the released phosphate with increase in the protein concentration from 10\u201350 ng/reaction. CHIKV-nsP2T protein was incubated in a 50 l reaction containing 50 mM MOPS at pH 7.25, 0\u20135 mM MgCl2, 1 mM ATP, at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. released phosphate was quantitated as described in the experimental procedures.

ATP appeared as the best substrate of CHIKV-nsP2T from all the NTPs. the pattern of substrate preference was similar to SFV [14], Flaviviruses [15], [16], Coronaviruses [17], and Hepatitis E Virus [12], which are general NTPases and can utilize any NTP. CHIKV-nsP2 is just an NTPase. other possibility is that unwinding activity of CHIKV-nsP2 is dependent on protease domain. extra domains in addition to core enzyme may be necessary for conferring strand separation activity to the enzyme. yltransferase and guanylyltransferase activities required to carry out reactions have been demonstrated to be nsP1 associated. nsP2 has been identified as the RNA triphosphatase for both SFV and SINV.
