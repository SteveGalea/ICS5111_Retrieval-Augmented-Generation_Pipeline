{"summary": "pteropid bats are reservoirs for important zoonotic paramyxoviruses, including Nipah virus and Hendra virus. both are members of the genus Henipavirus (family Paramyxoviridae) both have been associated with severe neurological and respiratory disease and high mortality rates in domestic animals and humans. henipaviruses are enzootic because they are classified as select agents. they require the highest level of biocontainment (Biosafety level) 4) in order to work with the live viral cultures required to conduct neutralization assays. few serological assays have been validated for wildlife species. in captive pteropid bats, the placenta has a hemodichorial structure. this type of placentation participates in the active transfer of IgG in utero [29] pteropus alecto bats have a high abundance of IgG in their milk, a feature generally associated with species that transfer maternal immunity via colostrum to their offspring. adult bats had an HeV seroprevalence of approximately 20%. pre-weaned individuals had a 56% seroprevalence (n = 790) pteropus vampyrus measured maternal antibodies up to 14 months post-parturition. in the first experiment, we vaccinated members of a captive breeding population of P. hypomelanus using a viral antigen closely related to Nipah virus. we measured the duration of maternal antibodies to Hendra virus in pups born to naturally infected dams in a captive colony of P. hypomelanus. 1.0 ml of blood was drawn from the bats prior to day 0 to establish a negative titer. blood was drawn from either the radial artery/vein or saphenous vein. a blood sample was collected from either the radial artery/vein or saphenous vein. a 1 ml tuberculin syringe for juveniles born to vaccinated mothers. CDV containing 30\u2013100 TCID50 of virus was added to each well. plates were incubated for at least 1 hr at 37\u00b0C. then Vero cells were added in suspension to each well. each well was examined for presence of typical CDV cytopathology. wells were scored as positive or negative. each adult animal was anaesthetized using a 25 g needle. 0.5\u20131 ml of blood was obtained monthly from one month to 12 months post-partum. serum neutralization tests were performed on a subset of samples. all experiments utilizing live virus were performed under BSL 4 conditions. the initial (distributive) phase describes the equilibration of a biologic agent between the intra- and extravascular spaces. the terminal phase or elimination represents the actual use of the material. five pregnant bats were vaccinated against canine distemper virus using a canarypox-vectored canine distemper virus vaccine. a blood sample was collected from either the radial artery/vein or saphenous vein using a 25 or 27 g 34\u201d needle for adults. non-specifically neutralize virus at dilutions of 116 and below. blood was placed in an EDTA tube (vaccutainer, BD USA) 0.5 ml plasma was sent to the animal health diagnostic center at Cornell University (Ithaca, NY) to measure the neutralizing antibodies against CDV. swab specimens from all adult and neonatal bats used in this experiment were screened and were negative for Hendra virus RNA using RT PCR. adult females were allowed to acclimatize for a period of one week following transfer into captivity before samples were obtained. each adult animal was anaesthetized using isoflurane, a gas anesthetic, and 2 ml of blood was obtained monthly from one month to 12 months post-part serum neutralization tests (SNTs) were performed on a subset of samples from pups 204 g and 677 g and for selected time points for four adults as described previously using a starting serum dilution of 120. both phases can be described by fitting independent linear models. five adult bats showed an immune response to the canine distemper vaccine. the initial and terminal half-lives were calculated for each pup. two pups could not be used in the half-life calculation. figure are the dam of the pups described in figure 2. Table 1. Initial and terminal half-lives (in days) for P. hypomelanus. pups Cahya and Chesa displayed bi-phasic rates of antibody decay. these calculations exclude pups because there were too few observations to calculate the half-life. the geometric mean for the initial phase was 36.83 days (CI 95%: 29.82\u201345.48) the mean duration of immunity was 255.13 days (95% CI: 221.0\u2013289.3) 8.5 months. four of the 12 pups in the study did not reach the negative cutoff within the timeframe of the study. five P. hypomelanus pups were born to vaccinated dams. the initial and terminal half-lives were calculated for each pup. two pups could not be used in the half-life calculation. named bats in figure are the dam of the pups described in figure 2. Table 1. Initial and terminal half-lives (in days) for P. hypomelanus. pups cahya and Chesa displayed bi-phasic rates of antibody decay. these calculations exclude pups because there were too few observations to calculate the half-life. 10 of 12 pups had initial half-lives equal to the terminal half-lives. the geometric mean for the initial phase was 36.83 days. the mean duration of immunity was 255.13 days (95% CI: 221.0\u2013289.3) 8.5 months. discussion Bats have become the subject of an increasing number of field-based epidemiological studies due to their association with zoonotic pathogens. it has been suggested that outbreaks of viruses within bat populations have been related to the waning of immunity in juvenile cohorts. previous age-stratified serological studies of henipaviruses in pteropid bats have found that the sero-status of neonates matches their dam [15], [17], [35], [49] maternal antibody had waned by approximately 6 months post-partum, coinciding with annual HeV spillover events. a wave of virus infection has also been detected in juvenile Rousettus aegyptiacus fruit bats approximately one the duration of maternal antibodies to measles virus in human infants has been shown to be longer in those born to naturally infected mothers versus mothers who were vaccinated. the timeframes we observed are longer than the suggested six months estimated at the population level for Hendra virus in P. scapulatus. faster decay of maternally derived antibodies has been reported in human infants born to vaccinated mothers compared with naturally immune mothers. pteropid immunology is important for modeling the dynamics of viral infections within flying fox populations."}
