{"summary": "radiotherapy for oncologic emergencies is an important aspect of the management of cancer patients. these emergencies include malignant spinal cord compression, brain metastases, superior vena cava obstruction, and uncontrolled tumour hemorrhage. to date, there remains no consensus among radiation oncologists regarding the indications and appropriateness of radiotherapy treatment on weekends. radiotherapy is an important treatment modality in the management of cancer patients. Approximately one half of all cancer patients require radiotherapy treatment during the course of their illness. on weekends and statutory holidays, emergency treatments are subject to the discretion of the attending radiation oncologist. quality assurance is defined as adherence of an institution to its own departmental policy. literature to suggest appropriateness of delivering radiation treatment is scarce. the main objective of the present study was to determine the incidence of radiotherapy treatment on weekends and statutory holidays. RESULTS From September 2002 to September 2004, 161 patients were treated as emergency cases over a weekend. the median number of patients treated was 21 per interval, with an average of 1\u20132 patients per weekend.
