{"summary": "in 2002, Beasely et al. described an unusual pattern of diffuse infiltrative lung disease termed acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia (AFOP) it is accepted as an under recognized variant of acute lung injury associated with a wide spectrum of clinical conditions, such as collagen vascular diseases [1-3], adverse drug reactions or environmental exposures [4-6] the microscopic presentation is also commonly observed in DAD, OP and EP [7-9], as well as in pulmonary vascular thrombosis [3,10 no necrosis or granulomas were observed; no evidence of diffuse alveolar damage, alveolitis or eosinophilic infiltration. the patient discharged on a tapering schedule of methylprednisolone 12 mg twice daily. anti-tuberculosis therapies were given and the patient markedly relieved from his symptoms. case 2 An 84-year-old man was admitted to a local hospital and presented with a 3-week history of fever and dry cough. intra-alveolus fibrin balls irregularly mixed with cancer cells. sputamentum exfoliative cytologic examination revealed a small number of cells with nuclei atypia. a surgical resection of the right lower lobe of the lung was performed. no necrosis or granulomas were observed; no evidence of diffuse alveolar damage, alveolitis or eosinophilic infiltration. the patient discharged on a tapering schedule of methylprednisolone 12 mg twice daily. CT-scan examination showed prominent spread of the previous lesion. occupying mass measured 7.5 cm *5.5 cm in the lower-lobe of the right lung. the patient underwent 1 course of chemotherapies, died of brain metastasis 10 months after surgery. radiographic re-examination revealed a small number of cells with nuclei atypia. a surgical resection of the right lower lobe of the lung was performed. large biopsy specimens obtained from open-lung biopsy are not as available as small biopsies. the diagnosis must be based on open-lung biopsy tissues rather than small biopsies. but it seems that misdiagnosis is hard to be avoided. there are reports of successful treatments with steroids. OP in occupying lesions was slightly reduced after steroids and antibiotics therapies, providing an illusion that the mass was benign. so the optimal opportunity of curing cancer was delayed by misdiagnosis. AFOP is not preferable in lung consolidation and occupying lesions."}
