{"summary": "1, 2, 3 Annual influenza vaccine offers the best available protection against influenza, but its effectiveness is limited by poor uptake among some populations. 4, 5, 6, 7 by our limited ability to predict influenza evolution and match the vaccine to the infecting strain. 10 antivirals have also been shown to be efficacious in preventing influenza. participants randomly assigned to receive either prophylaxis with oseltamivir during the influenza season or the 2007/2008 Fluviral\u00ae vaccine. participants randomized to the vaccination arm were contacted at the onset of influenza season. the 2007/2008 influenza season was longer than anticipated. acute respiratory illness was defined as an acute illness lasting >24 hours associated with either fever and one or more respiratory symptoms. nasopharyngeal swabs were tested at the Ontario Public Health Laboratory using inhouse polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the detection of influenza, 13 viral culture and Seeplex\u00ae RV12 multiplex PCR. study participants excluded participants who had a contraindication to influenza vaccine or oseltamivir within 6 months of study entry. participants were unable to take oral oseltamivir for more than 72 hours or were planning to be >100 km from the study site. at 13 weeks, study participants randomized to oseltamivir were given the option of continuing prophylaxis, discontinuing oseltamivir and being vaccinated, or discontinuing prophylaxis without vaccination. participants completed weekly diaries regarding symptoms of and contact with respiratory illness from enrolment until 2 weeks after the end of influenza season. influenza was defined as a fourfold increase in HI titre between samples other than pre and postvaccination. each serum sample obtained from participants in the antiviral group had liver enzyme testing performed. oseltamivir group N = 42 (%*) Pvalue Median age (range) 413 years (25\u201363 years) 406 years (25\u201364 years) 080 Sex Female 9 (75) 28 (67) 073 Diagnosed with asthma 0 5 (12) 058 Current prescription medication 6 (50) 25 (60) 050 Influenza vaccine Not in past 3 years 0 7 (17) 1 or 2 years 4 (33) 8 (19) All 3 years 8 (67) thirty-nine of 42 participants (95%) reported taking six or seven capsules per week for the first 8 weeks. by week 12, 34 (81%) continued to miss no more than one capsule per week. adherence in those reporting taking any of the medication was higher within the first 10 weeks than in the latter 10 weeks of the study. the acute respiratory illness rate was 64 per 1000 persondays, the influenza infection rate was 19 per 1000 persondays, and the infection rate owing to other respiratory viruses was 06 illnesses per 1000 persondays. participants reported working on 240 of 284 (85%) regularly scheduled work days during their acute respiratory illness. there was no association between the likelihood of working while ill and the type of virus detected, gender, age, average hours worked per week or profession. five of the ten influenza infections in participants in the oseltamivir group occurred before prophylaxis was initiated. 92% of people taking once daily doses for 6 weeks took 90% of their pills 20 and 88% of poultry workers took all doses of a 7day course. this was a pilot study and was not powered to elucidate differences between study arms or to assess risk factors for illness or for adherence to prophylaxis.
