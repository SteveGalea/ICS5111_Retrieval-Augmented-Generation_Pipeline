{"summary": "the nucleolus is the assembly site and processing for small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), telomerase and the signal recognition particle. it is also the assembly site and processing for small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), telomerase and the signal recognition particle. this review will focus on the structural changes of the nucleolus (and the rDNA) of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. we will briefly describe some aspects of the nucleolar biology of metazoans that are connected to the nucleolar biology of this simple yeast. this correlation has boosted S. cerevisiae as an excellent model organism. in budding yeast, aging has been traditionally divided into two concepts. the first concept, replicative aging, stems from early works in the 50s. the second concept, chronological aging, is the length of time a population of yeast cells remains viable in a nondividing state following nutrient deprivation. small nucleoli and reduced ribosome biogenesis are hallmarks of longevity. expanded nucleoli, elevated ribosome biogenesis and increased protein synthesis are hallmarks of aging. long-lived mutants of caenorhabditis elegans showed the small nucleoli phenotype. the nucleolus is a crescent-shaped structure that occupies roughly one-third of the nuclear volume. the rDNA is enclosed inside it, abutting the nuclear envelope. the rDNA is located on the right arm of chromosome XII, the largest chromosome in this yeast species. the 35S transcription unit (transcribed by the RNApol I) is depicted (18S, 5.8S and 25S) these are separated by internal transcribed spacers (ITS1 and ITS2) besides external transcribed spacers which lie at the 18S and 25S ends. the 35S and the 5S are separated by two intergenic regions (IGS1 and IGS2) the sirtuin family is the most unstable region in the genome due to its repetitive nature and high recombination rate. rDNA condensation seems to play a central role in quickly reshaping the nucleolus. morphology of the Yeast nucleolus during a single cell cycle is thought to change little. however, its morphology under the microscope goes through astonishing changes. the rDNA loop is extensively studied as a model for the chromosome condensation process that occurs in metazoan prophase. both condensin and cohesin SMC complexes were essential for the transition from puff to loop. cell cycle regulators play critical roles in rDNA reshaping. rDNA condenses back into short lines or clusters. the rDNA loop has been extensively studied as a model for the chromosome condensation process that occurs in metazoan prophase. despite the controversy about whether yeast chromosomes actually condense as their higher eukaryotes counterparts. rDNA morphology at this stage is controlled by cell cycle regulators. rDNA morphology is controlled by the Polo Like Kinase 1 ortholog Cdc5, Aurora Kinase B ortholog Ipl1 and the master cell cycle phosphatase Cdc14. most of the splicing resources are invested in ribosome genes. TORC1, stress and the size of the nucleolus The Target of Rapamycin (TOR), master regulator of the cell, coordinates metabolism, cell growth and proliferation. TOR is composed by the TOR complex 1 (TORC1) and TOR complex 2 (TORC2) in budding yeast, mTORC1 and mTORC2 in humans. the TORC1 complex controls all three RNA polymerases [102,103]. Tor1 binds to the 35S promoter of rDNA in a rapamycin and nutrient starvation manner. the exact mechanism whereby Tor1 controls the rDNA transcription is still not clear [111,112,113] a dramatic shrinkage or compaction of the rDNA takes place upon exposure to different stressors such as rapamycin, nitrogen starvation, glucose starvation, calorie restriction, heat stress (HS), oxidative stress and UV radiation. a cell culture coming from a Nz arrest was stressed by shifting the temperature from 25 C to 37 C for 90 min, while keeping the Nz arrest. hypothetical model for nucleophagy and aging/longevity mechanisms in yeast cells. nutrients and growth signals stimulate the Target Of Rapamycin (TOR), leading to rDNA transcription in the nucleolus (Nu), which acquires an enlarged nucleolar phenotype (green); as result, ribosome biogenesis increases. this impinges on the rate and accuracy of translation, increasing the latter while decreasing the latter, thus compromising proteostasis TOR pathway is involved in the rDNA chromatin structure in different ways. epigenetic regulation and condensin activity appear as potential mechanisms. in this scenario, condensin acts on the stability of the rDNA [145,146] condensation (prior to anaphase) of locus was independent from Cdc14 activation [135,153], the phosphatase required for rRNA transcription inhibition and condensin loading onto the rDNA during anaphase [154,155,156]. possible explanation is through the atypical Rio1 kinase involved in both ribosome biogenesis and nutrient sensing parallel to TORC1 [157,158]. silencing of the rDNA array by Sir2 is regulated through condensin action. rDNA silencing is regulated through condensin action, and rapamycin treatment increases condensin binding to the rDNA. post-translational modifications of histones are considered to promote chromatin compaction. a small nucleolar phenotype was found in mutants for the Spt16 and Pob3 subunits of this complex. rDNA is subjected to epigenetic silencing [180,181,182,183]. rDNA is subjected to epigenetic silencing [164,184,185,186,187,188,189,190,191,192] condensin-mediated nucleolar shrinkage could prevent genetic instability associated with repetitive sequences. rDNA condensation is also regulated by the Jhd2 demethylase. rDNA condensation is also regulated by the Jhd2 demethylase. sirtuin proteins Hst3 and Hst4 have been shown to be modulated by the TORC1 complex. it affects the acetylation status of histones H3 and H4 independently of the nicotinamidase PNC1 gene expression. it is important to stress that sirtuins are regulated by NAD+ levels. post-translational modifications of histones are considered to promote chromatin compaction. uins may directly control rDNA compaction by promoting H2A and H4 interaction. modifications mediated by acetyl transferases like Nat4 and loss of histone H4 acetylation were linked to calorie restriction-mediated longevity and to rDNA silencing. ins appear as conserved regulators of aging/longevity [193,195] nucleolar rearrangements occur in higher eukaryotes during stress, the cell cycle or as a result of cell aging. different nucleolar rearrangements occur in higher eukaryotes during stress, the cell cycle or as a result of cell aging. domain Presence of a perinucleolar domain All rRNA genes together 5S and 45S genes in different genome loci The rDNA in a single array at chromosome XII right arm The rDNA 45S array in the five acrocentric chromosomes (13, 14, 15, 21, 22); 5S in chromosome 1 100\u2013200 copies (haploid) of a 9.1 Kb unit 300\u2013400 copies (haploid) of the 43 Kb decreasing the 45S copies have been linked to nucleolar activity, proliferation and inactivation of p53 [199] rDNA changes may operate as a tumour adaptive strategy to promote genome instability. different stresses that impact on the nucleolar structure can have different outcomes. stressors that fragment the nucleolus could be genotoxic. those that suppress rDNA transcription, rRNA processing and ribosome production could be safer antiproliferative therapies. a compound with antimetastatic potential, called metaarrestin, acts through the inhibition of transcription by RNA pol I. several p53 isoforms are released from the nucleolus into the nucleoplasm. they bind to Mdm2, which inhibits the destruction of p53. another RP protein, RPL26, binds to the 5\u2019-UTR of p53 mRNA. s, low levels of PICT1 are associated to tumour progression. cytoplasmic expression of this protein is related to a bad prognostic for non-small cell lung cancer. it is possible that tumours cells, subjected to endogenous or exogenous stress, could modulate PICT1 levels as a strategy to impinge on p53 function. inhibiting TOR signalling could mediate longevity through sirtuin and ribosome production and its effect on rDNA and nucleolar structure and stability. the nucleolus could be serving as a genome buffering system and a stress sensor for the cell."}
