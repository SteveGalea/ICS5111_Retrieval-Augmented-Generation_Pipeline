{"summary": "the current HICPAC guidelines explicitly recommend wearing a face shield or goggles during all patient care for certain illnesses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and avian influenza. the current HICPAC guidelines explicitly recommend wearing a face shield or goggles while performing aerosol-generating procedures. small aerosol droplets from a coughing patient can remain airborne and spread throughout a room. small droplets from a coughing patient can remain airborne and spread throughout a room, and can easily be inhaled by a health care worker. 4.7 m could be found 6 feet away from the patient, but the amount of virus detected was much lower than at closer distances. face shields are more bulky than goggles or safety glasses but offer the advantage of guarding the entire face from contamination. METHODS Influenza Virus Culture Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (ATCC CCL-34) and influenza strain A/WS/33 (H1N1, ATCC VR-825) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, Va.) the mouth of the cough aerosol simulator and the mouth of the breathing simulator were 152 cm (60 inches) above the floor. the optical particle counters (OPCs) and the droplet size analyzer were not used. a respirator was sealed to the breathing head form to act as a filter to collect the virus that was inhaled. the cough airflow was produced by a metal bellows driven by a computer-controlled linear motor. it had a volume of 4.2 l and a peak flow rate of 11.4 liters per second. each cough was initiated at the start of an inhalation by the breathing simulator. aerosol samples through vertical 16 cm 3 mm inner-diameter stainless-steel tubes with inlets located 4.4 cm to the left and right of the mouth of the breathing simulator. the tube inlets were behind the face shield (that is, between the face shield and the head form) the respirator collection filter was removed and four round 25-mm coupons were punched from it. the experiments performed with influenza virus had the same experimental parameters. the volume of aerosol inhaled by the breathing simulator was estimated by integrating the aerosol volume concentration and the breathing flow rate for 1.4 sec after the cough. the results were summed over all of the size bins to get the total volume of inhaled aerosol. the four coupons taken from each respirator had an area of 4.9 cm2 each. the entire respirator had an area of 137 cm2. qPCR results for the number of viruses inhaled and the amount of virus deposited on each layer were treated as fixed effects. cough aerosol simulator, breathing simulator, and aerosol particle measurement instruments were controlled from outside the exposure chamber. the chamber temperature was 24\u00b0C (SD 1.4\u00b0C) and the relative humidity was 23% (SD 3.3%). for experiments using influenza virus, optical particle counters (OPCs) and the droplet size analyzer were not used. a micropump nebulizer was used to produce an aerosol with a VMD of 3.4 m and a GSD of 2.9 (small-particle cough aerosol) for both aerosol generators, the total volume of the aerosol expelled during each cough was approximately 68 l. the cough airflow was produced by a metal bellows driven by a computer-controlled linear motor. a spray droplet size analyzer was attached behind the breathing head form. two optical particle counters drew aerosol samples through vertical 16 cm 3 mm inner-diameter stainless-steel tubes with inlets located 4.4 cm to the left and right of the mouth of the breathing simulator. viral plaque assays (VPAs) were performed to determine the amount of viable influenza virus recovered. for the short range experiments with the large particle cough aerosol, viral plaque assays (VPAs) were performed to determine the amount of viable influenza virus recovered. the volume of aerosol inhaled by the breathing simulator was determined by integrating the volume concentration and the breathing rate (32 l/min) over time. the effects of the use of a face shield, the cough aerosol particle size distribution, and the distance from the coughing to the breathing simulator on the total volume of particles inhaled were compared by an analysis of variance. small-particle cough aerosol particles had a total volume of 0.58 l, a VMD of 9.5 m, and a GSD of 3.4. for the small-particle cough aerosol, the size distribution of the inhaled particles was 0.52 l, with a VMD of 2.1 and a GSD of 2.0. the difference in the total inhaled volume approached statistical significance (p = 0.069) exposure to the cough aerosol was characterized by an initial spike in concentration, followed by lower levels as the aerosol particles dispersed and settled over time. wearing a face shield significantly reduced the amount of cough aerosol that was inhaled by the breathing simulator. each line is the average of 3 tests. the lines were smoothed with a 61-point running average. every 300th point is marked with a symbol to aid in distinguishing the lines. the face shield combined was significantly less than the amount deposited on the respirator alone when the face shield was not worn. the fraction of the influenza virus that was detected on the inner layers of the respirator decreased the amount of virus that was deposited on the outer layer relative to the inner layers of the respirator. each bar is the average SD of 3 experiments. the volume of small-particle cough aerosol inhaled during the first 1.4 sec was lower than that of the large-particle aerosol. however, the concentration of the inhaled small-particle aerosol cloud typically remained high enough to be in the detection range of the spray analyzer for several seconds longer than did the large-particle aerosol. exposure to the cough aerosol was characterized by an initial spike in concentration, followed by lower levels as the aerosol particles dispersed and settled over time. a greater volume of cough aerosol particles was inhaled during experiments using the small-particle aerosol (p 0.001) each line is the average of 3 tests. the lines were smoothed with a 61-point running average. every 300th point is marked with a symbol to aid in distinguishing the lines. the amount of viable influenza virus recovered from the respirator and the face shield is shown in Figure 10. the use of a face shield reduced the amount of viable influenza virus on the respirator by 70%, although the difference was not statistically significant. each bar is the average SD of 3 experiments. small-particle cough aerosol was inhaled by the breathing simulator immediately after a cough when no face shield was worn and the simulators were 46 cm apart. the situation modeled here is a \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d because it assumes a patient is coughing directly into the face of a health care worker at close range while the worker is inhaling. however, these results do demonstrate the risk that a substantial exposure to respiratory fluid aerosols can occur very quickly when the caregiver is close the difference in concentration decreases over time as the aerosol disperses more evenly throughout the room. it is interesting to compare the volume of particles that were inhaled immediately after a cough to those inhaled from 1 min to 30 min after the cough. the spray analyzer directly measures a region within the aerosol cloud. virus deposition was reduced by only 68%, again because small particles are better able to travel around the face shield and be inhaled. extending the collection time from 5 min to 30 min increased the virus collection without a face shield by only 10%. this is consistent with findings from comparing volumes of inhaled particles with use of spray analyzer and OPCs. the CDC recommended that health care workers consider using face shields to reduce the surface contamination of respirators. julian zelizer: the limitations of this study need to be acknowledged. he says it is impossible to define any particular cough aerosol profile as representative of a human cough. zelizer: this is unlikely to be the case for human cough aerosols because pathogens such as influenza are not uniformly distributed through the respiratory tract. the peak at the larger particle size generally dominated during the initial part of the cough and inhalation, while the peak at the smaller size dominated later in the cough. the test chamber was sealed so that no air exchange or filtration occurred during the experiments. this is probably the most common situation, but it is not difficult to imagine scenarios where, for example, the head of a health care worker might be tilted up or sideways, away from a supine patient, to examine a monitor. the findings and conclusions in this report do not necessarily
