{"summary": "china's 1-3-7 approach defines targets used to guide and monitor cases. report of malaria cases within one day, confirmation and investigation within three days, and appropriate public health response to prevent further transmission within seven days. the approach is a valuable and simple set of targets that could be adopted by other countries and by similar disease elimination programs. malaria is highly clustered geographically into micro-foci, or hotspots. at low transmission levels, malaria is highly clustered geographically into micro-foci, or hotspots, or is clustered demographically into high-risk groups. RACD is widely adopted and implemented malaria elimination strategy. any confirmed and suspected malaria cases by law must be reported to the web-based health information system within 24 hours of diagnosis by the local health-care provider. all malaria cases should be confirmed and visited by the county-level china CDC, where the case is reported within three days, to determine where the case originated. malaria is now rare in china, the quality of malaria diagnosis cannot be assured at lower levels of the health system. local health-care providers are encouraged to report both confirmed and suspected malaria cases within 24 hours using the web-based China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention (CISDCP) the local area around a case (the focus) is investigated to evaluate the risk of local transmission. different actions are triggered according to the results of the investigation. if the case is classified as local or imported, the focus is classified as an \u201cinactive focus\u201d. monthly 1-3-7 implementation analysis reports are generated by the Ministry of Health and circulated to all Provincial Health Departments and at a national level to the National Institute of Parasitic Diseases. a reporting channel feeds into the larger information system to provide critical feedback on the results of the response and action. many disease control programs yearn for such a feedback loop. the information technology challenge was overcome in china by integrating malaria reporting into the web-based health information system (CISDCP) established after the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak. the government introduced a small financial incentive to compensate for the additional work required. standardized genotyping methods are not yet defined and are currently unlikely to be completed within the three-day window. completion of focus investigation and response within the seven-day window is challenging because of the time required for comprehensive assessment of transmission risk and for planning and implementation of response activities. the human and financial resources needed to reach the 1-3-7 targets may be considerable. a 2-4-7-like approach provides a simple set of targets for programs to employ. 1-3-7 is certainly operationally useful and, if the correct information system is in place, is easy to measure."}
