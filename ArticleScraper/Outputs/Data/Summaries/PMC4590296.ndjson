{"summary": "the roots of Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch are widely used in many Chinese herbal remedies for their ability to nourish \u201cQi\u201d, alleviate pain, tonify the spleen and stomach, eliminate phlegm and relieve cough1,2. a number of active components of which glycyrrhizic acid (GA) is considered the most important. recombinant pPIC9K\u2013GuHMGR plasmid was transferred into the disarmed E. coli DH520. recombinant pPIC9K\u2013GuHMGR plasmid was linearized by restriction. an aliquot (0.5 mL) of yeast peptone dextrose (YPD) medium was then added. cells were cultured at 30 \u00b0C, 200 rpm for 1 h. single colonies were removed and incubated simultaneously at 30 \u00b0C for 2\u20134 days. primer pair of the GuHMGR gene was as previously stated. the cycling parameters were as follows: 94 \u00b0C for 5 min; 30 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 60 \u00b0C for 30 s, extension at 72 \u00b0C for 2 min; and a final extension at 72 \u00b0C for 10 min. RT-PCR analysis Total RNA was isolated from different strains using a yeast RNA rapid extraction kit (Beijing BoMaiDe Medical Technology Co., Ltd.) to remove plasmid DNA, RNase-free DNase I enzyme (Tiangen Biotech Co., Ltd.) was used according to the manufacturers instructions. the detection wavelength was 283 nm and the injection volume 20 L. a stock solution of ergosterol containing 11.38 mg in 10 mL absolute ethanol was used to prepare a series of standard solutions containing 0.01%, 0.05%, 0.1%, 0.5%, 2%, and 5% of the stock solution in absolute ethanol. the amplified fragments were purified and subcloned into pMD19-T (Takara, Japan) the resulting vector (GuHMGR-T) was digested with SnaBI (2 h at 37 \u00b0C) and notI (2 h at 37 \u00b0C) the resulting recombinant pPIC9K\u2013GuHMGR plasmid was transferred into the disarmed E. coli DH520. PCR was used to check that the recombinant P. pastoris contained the GuHMGR gene. the single colonies were used as PCR template21. the cycling parameters were as follows: 94 \u00b0C for 5 min. the standard plasmids pMD19-T\u2013GuHMGR and pMD19-T\u2013GAP were obtained, extracted and diluted to 109, 108, 107, 106, 105, 104, 103, and 102 copy numbers/2 L. for real-time PCR analysis, the primer pairs in Table 1 were used with following cycling parameters: 95 \u00b0C for 10 min. the cycle number was set at 18, 20, 22, 24 and 26, and the optimal cycle number determined by electrophoresis in agarose gel. the primer pair, GF (5\u2032-CACAATGGCTATCACTGTCG-3\u2032) and GR (5\u2032-GACACACTACAGCCCGCATT-3\u2032), was used to amplify the GAP gene as an internal control. recovery was assessed using 9 samples of blank P. pastoris cells accurately weighed (50 mg) and spiked with 2.91 g, 5.05 g and 8.41 g ergosterol. all 96 h cultures were collected by centrifugation at 5000 rpm. PCR showed a band between 86 and 47 kDa in samples from recombinant P. pastoris. the negative control was dark yellow while the recombinant P. pastoris was yellowish-white. recombinant strains containing the GuHMGR gene were inducible. RT-PCR analysis revealed the relative abundance of the GuHMGR gene in the transgenic P. pastoris strains. the cycle number was finally fixed at 20 based on a preliminary experiment. copy number P value 1 2 4 8 13 44 1 \u2013 0.425 0.000 0.736 0.994 0.019 2 0.425 \u2013 0.000 0.264 0.421 0.082 4 0.000 \u2013 0.000 0.000 \u2013 0.741 0.010 13 0.994 0.421 0.000 0.741 \u2013 0.018 44 0.019 0.082 0.000 0.010 0.018 \u2013 3.5. the content of ergosterol was only 1.04 times negative control. for copy number 13, the content of ergosterol was only 1.8 times negative control. independent t-test results of the content of ergosterol in different recombinant P. pastoris strains. construction of recombinant plasmid pPIC\u2013GuHMGR. most single colonies of recombinant P. pastoris simultaneously growing on MM and MD media were shown by PCR to have the correct fragment length. negative control was dark yellow while recombinant P. pastoris was yellowish-white. copy numbers of the GuHMGR gene in different recombinant P. pastoris strains were found to be 1, 2, 4, 8, 13 and 44 (Table 2). RT-PCR analysis revealed the GuHMGR gene was expressed in all transgenic P. pastoris strains at different levels. expression of the GAP gene was roughly similar (Fig. 4a) independent t-test results of expression of the GuHMGR gene in different recombinant P. pastoris strains are listed in Table 4. The level of ergosterol in all recombinant P. pastoris strains was 1.07\u20132.51 times higher than in all recombinant P. pastoris strains. the content of ergosterol showed an increasing\u2013decreasing\u2013increasing pattern for strains with copy number 4. at copy number 8, the content of ergosterol was highest (2.5 times the negative control); for copy number 13, the content of ergosterol was only 1.04 times negative control; and for copy number 44, the content of ergosterol was 1.8 times negative control. despite the high level of interest in CNV, there are few reports of CNV in plant genes. in this study, recombinant strains containing 1, 2, 4, 8, 13 and 44 copies of the GuHMGR gene were constructed. RT-PCR analysis revealed that the GuHMGR gene was expressed in all transgenic P. pastoris strains at different levels. gene suggests that an increase in the latter could lead to an increase in the production of GA in G. uralensis. but the current results provide an important basis for further studies aimed at increasing the GA content of G. uralensis and exploring its biosynthesis in vitro."}
