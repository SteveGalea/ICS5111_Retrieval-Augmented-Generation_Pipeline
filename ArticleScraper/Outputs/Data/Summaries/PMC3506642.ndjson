{"summary": "canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) is the most severe and fatal form of leishmaniasis if left untreated once symptoms begin. canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) represents a serious public health problem in both human and veterinary medicine. a vaccine composed of a glycoproteic complex, fucose\u2013mannose ligand, associated with saponin (Leishmune\u00ae/Fort Dodge) showed 76% to 80% vaccine efficacy in dogs in a field assay in an endemic area in Brazil [16], [17], [18]. another vaccine licensed in Brazil, composed of the A2 recombinant protein in formulation with saponin (Leish-Tec\u00ae/Hertape Calier), was also the aim of this study was to further evaluate the immunogenicity and perform parasitological analysis after challenge by intradermal inoculum with L. infantum plus salivary gland extract. we also evaluated the cellular immune response using real-time PCR. 1 mL of sterile 0.9% saline received 600 g of L. braziliensis promastigote protein in 1 mL of sterile 0.9% saline; 1 mg of saponin in 1 mL of sterile 0.9% saline. animals received three subcutaneous injections in the right ear. Humoral Immune Response Humoral immune response was evaluated by using soluble lysate of L. infantum antigen (MHOM/BR/1972/BH46) according to the conventional ELISA. pooled normal rat serum (diluted 16000) was employed as the isotypic control. the results were expressed as the percentage of positive cells within the selected gate for cell surface markers presenting bimodal distribution (CD5, CD4, CD8 and CD21) semi-quantitative analyses were carried out for the cell surface marker (MHC-II) and the results were expressed as the mean fluorescence channel on a log scale. PBMCs were added to triplicate wells together with 100 L of vaccine soluble antigen (VSA) (25 g/mL) or 100 L of SLcA (25 g/mL) incubation was carried out in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37\u00b0C for 5 days. DNA polymerase of L. infantum (GenBank accession number AF009147) were used for real-time PCR. target primer sequence (5\u2032\u20133\u2032) product (bp) GAPDH was normalized according to the 2Ct. primers amplified a 90-bp fragment of a single-copy of the gene of DNA polymerase of L. infantum. PCR was carried out in a final volume of 25 L containing 200 nM forward and reverse primers. twenty mongrel dogs were born and reared in the kennels of the animal science center, Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto, Minas Gerais, Brazil. the dogs were treated at 7 months with an anthelmintic and vaccinated against rabies. the dogs were euthanized in 885 dac and tissues were collected to evaluate the cytokine profile and parasite load. the dogs were euthanized in 885 dac and were euthanized. FITC-labelled mouse anti-human-CD21 (mouse-IgG1: clone IOBla) and phycoerythrin-Cy5-conjugated mouse anti-human-CD14 (mouse-IgG2a: clone TUK4) mAbs were used in a direct immunofluorescence assay. separated PBMCs were resuspended in Gibco RPMI1640 medium, homogenized, washed twice with RPMI 1640, centrifuged at 450g for 10 min at room temperature, homogenized and finally resuspended in RPMI 1640 at 107 cells/mL. incubations were carried out in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37\u00b0C for 3 (mitogenic-stimulated cultures) or 5 days ( Strand cDNAs were synthesised from 1.0 g of total RNA using the ThermoScriptTM RT-PCR System (Invitrogen Brasil, So Paulo, SP, Brazil) with oligodT primers. total genomic DNA was extracted from approximately 20 mg of spleen using WizardTM Genomic DNA Purification Kit. PCR was carried out in a final volume of 25 L containing 100 mM of forward and reverse primers. the samples were incubated at 95\u00b0C for 10 min and then submitted to 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s and 60\u00b0C for 1 min. standard curves were prepared using known quantities of pGEM\u00ae T plasmids (Promega, USA) containing inserts of interest [32]. the same procedure was carried out for the GAPDH gene (115 bp fragment GenBank accession number AB038240). the results were expressed as the number of amastigotes per mg of spleen. group elicited higher levels (p0.05) of total IgG at 885 dac. higher levels (p0.05) of anti-Leishmania IgG2 were observed in LB dogs. LB showed higher levels (p0.05) of IgG2 compared with C and Sap groups. the y-axis represents the mean ELISA absorbance values determined at 492 nm in serum samples diluted 180 for IgG total and subclasses. significant differences (p0.05) between the LBSap group and control C, Sap and LB groups are indicated. LB group at 885 dac revealed an increase (p0.05) in circulating CD5+ T lymphocytes in dogs vaccinated with LB and LBSap compared with the Sap group at 274 dac. LB group revealed an increase (p0.05) in CD5+ T lymphocytes at 541 dac compared with the Sap group at 274 dac. BSap group showed increase (p0.05) number of circulating CD4+ T lymphocytes at 541 dac compared with C dogs. lower (p0.05) CD8+ T-cell counts were observed in dogs vaccinated with LBSap. the numbers of circulating CD14+ monocytes were higher (p0.05) in LBSap-vaccinated dogs at 885 dac. we used two different antigenic stimuli: VSA (L. braziliensis) in order to evaluate memory lymphoproliferative immune response against antigens of the vaccine components. the results are expressed as index (stimulated cultures over non-stimulated cultures) of mean frequencies of CD5+, CD21+, CD4+ and CD8+ cells and MHC II expression in lymphocytes. differences between values measured at 90, 435 and 885 dac under the same group are indicated by connecting lines. the CD21+ B cells index had a significant increase (p0.05) in LBSap dogs at 90 dac. the LB and LBSap dogs showed a higher (p0.05) CD4+ T lymphocytes index. cytokine expression of cytokines was assessed in the spleen of vaccinated/challenged dogs. we also evaluated the IFN-/IL-10 or IFN-/TGF-1 ratios in the spleen of the animals. a higher (p0.05) IFN-/TGF-1 ratio in LBSap dogs than in the C, Sap and LB groups. this data is associated with a parasite burden reduction of 33% in Sap, 40% in LB and 54% in LBSap groups compared with C animals. these results indicate the high protective potential of LBSap vaccine even long term after challenge (885 dac). LB group showed higher levels (p0.05) of total IgG at 20 dac. higher levels (p0.05) of anti-Leishmania IgG2 were observed in LB dogs. LB showed higher levels (p0.05) of IgG2 compared with C and Sap groups.

Discussion The growing expansion and urbanization of VL in Brazil and worldwide show the importance of this emerging and re-emergence disease. a detailed analysis of the immunogenicity of LBSap vaccine in dogs during 885 days after intradermal inoculation using L. infantum and SGE of L. longipalpis. the vaccine has been shown to induce significant immunization effects, including increased Ig isotypes, higher levels of circulating CD8+ T lymphocytes and intense cell proliferation. lower levels of IgG1 are in fact more closely associated with symptomatic dogs [41], [42], [43]. our findings suggest that the LBSap vaccine promotes a mixed profile of immune responses (Th1/Th2) characteristic of vaccines composed of whole Leishmania antigens. the intense humoral immune response demonstrated in the LBSap group was synchronous with the increased counts of circulating lymphocytes. in the present study, we observed increased levels of CD4+ T cells (20 and 274 dac) as well as CD8+ T cells (20 and 90 dac) in vaccinated animals after intravenous challenge with L. infantum. studies using naturally infected animals showed a correlation between increased numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells. PBMCs from the LBSap group were stimulated with in vitro antigenic stimulation with VSA and SLcA. stimulation with SLcA showed only higher cell reactivity at 435 dac in the vaccine group. PBMCs from vaccinated dogs had a higher and sustained MHC-II expression index (90 and 885 dac) in cultures stimulated with SLcA. in vitro studies evaluating dogs naturally infected by L. infantum showed a decrease in MHC-II expression mainly in symptomatic animals with high parasite burden in the bone marrow and skin. dogs vaccinated with LBSap present valuable biomarkers of immunogenicity and protection against canine leishmaniasis even after 885 days post-challenge. the in vitro culture passages and the varying concentrations of the parasite used, particularly in vaccine trials, have not been shown to be effective in infection. PCR technique was used to quantify the number of amastigotes per mg of spleen. only LBSap group showed lower parasitism compared with LB (40%) and Sap (33%) groups. the protection obtained in the present study confirms the capacity of LBSap vaccine to limit parasite replication."}
