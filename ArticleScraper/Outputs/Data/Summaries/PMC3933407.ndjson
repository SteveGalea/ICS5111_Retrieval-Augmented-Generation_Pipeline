{"summary": "spiroindoles, with C-3 as spiro atom, have received considerable interest due to their strong biological activities. alkylated Meldrum's acid has been encountered in the synthesis of dehydro-ar-juvabione [15], indane subunit containing paraquinonic acid ethyl ester, and deliquinone natural products. the reaction of 1H-indole-2,3-dione, malononitrile/ethylcyanoacetate and Meldrum's acid in absolute ethanol under microwave irradiation and conventional heating (Scheme 1). the overall process involves the Knoevenagel condensation of Meldrum's acid with 1H-indole-2,3-dione followed by \u201cin situ\u201d Michael addition of malononitrile/ethylcyanoacetate in ylcyanoacetate (2), and 2,2-dioxane-4,6-diones (3) were examined in the presence of catalytic amount (30 mg) of ZnO nanoparticles under microwave irradiation and conventional heating. synthesis of 4a and 5a was used as a model reaction. a mixture of 1H-indole-2,3-dione, malononitrile, and 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxane-4,6-diones in the presence of ZnO nanoparticle afforded products in 87% yield under microwave irradiation. the synthesis of compounds 4a and 5a was carried out by refluxing for 10. reaction took 9 min resulting in 62% yield, while under microwave irradiation, reaction took 87% of the product. it showed that microwave irradiation was found to have a beneficial effect on the synthesis of spiro(indole-pyranodioxine) derivatives. using more than 30 mg has less effect on the yield and time of the reaction. the catalyst recovered by filtration from the reaction mixture after dilution with ethyl acetate was reused as such for subsequent experiments under similar conditions. the catalyst retained optimum activity till five cycles after which drop in yield was observed. MR spectra were recorded using DMSO-d6 and CDCl3 as solvent and tetramethylsilane (TMS) as internal reference standard. the microwave-assisted reactions were carried out in a catalysts systems Scientific multimode MW oven attached with a magnetic stirrer and reflux condenser. an equimolar mixture of 1H-indole-2,3-dione (1) (1 mmole), malononitrile/ethylcynoacetate (2), and 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxane-4,6-diones (3) (1 mmole) was refluxed for 10-11 hrs. the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and solidified within an hour. all the synthesized compounds were identified by their melting point, IR, 1HNMR, 13CNMR, and mass spectral studies. all the synthesized compounds were identified by their melting point, IR, 1HNMR, 13CNMR, and spectral studies. 4b 7\u2032-Amino-2\u20322\u2032-dimethyl-2,4\u2032-dioxo-5-chloro-1,2-dihydrospiro[indoline-3,5\u2032-pyrano[2,3-d][1\u2032,3\u2032]dioxine]-6\u2032-carbonitrile.
