{"summary": "influenza viruses are classified into 3 principal types (A, B, and C) of which types A and B are important causes of human disease. only type A viruses have caused pandemics; only type A viruses have caused pandemics. influenza is the greatest current threat for a pandemic virus. global public health authorities recommend increased vigilance for any novel influenza virus infections in humans as a cornerstone of pandemic preparedness. the increased risk is believed to be related to several physiologic changes that occur during pregnancy. women at term nearly 5 times more likely to be hospitalized than postpartum women (4). pregnant women should be considered a population for which special considerations for prevention and treatment for influenza need to be made. a small increased risk for birth defects in general and for specific birth defects have been observed in some but not all studies. a recent case-control study showed that mothers of infants with any type of birth defect were slightly more likely to report influenza during early pregnancy than mothers of control infants. nonpharmaceutical interventions will mitigate disease rates and severity and the societal impact of the pandemic beyond health outcomes. the cdc recently released guidance for nonpharmaceutical interventions during a pandemic that focuses on isolation of ill persons, voluntary quarantine of households with ill persons and social distancing techniques. the international outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (33) can shed light on how to approach these complicated issues. obstetric services were moved into a newly designed facility that had entrances, elevators, and air-handling systems that were separate from the rest of the hospital. obstetric services were transferred to a separate hospital from hospitals in which SARS cases were managed. two antiviral medications are currently recommended for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza in humans (15) these medications, both neuraminidase inhibitors, are available in oral (oseltamivir [Tamiflu]) and inhaled (zanamivir [Relenza] forms. two additional anti-influenza medications, the M2 ion channel blockers rimantidine and amantadine, are currently not recommended for use because of high rates of resistance the bioavailability of zanamivir is lower (12%\u201317%) than that of oseltamivir (80%), leading some to suggest that it might be preferred during pregnancy (3). many pregnant women will require treatment with other medications, such as antibiotics for secondary bacterial pneumonia. inactivated influenza vaccine is recommended in all 3 trimesters of pregnancy (15,40) despite these recommendations, compliance has been low (15), probably because of concerns among women and their healthcare providers regarding the safety of vaccination during pregnancy. public health professionals will have the opportunity to weigh risks and benefits of anti-influenza medications. nonpharmaceutical interventions will mitigate disease rates and severity and the societal impact of the pandemic beyond health outcomes. these recommendations present special challenges for pregnant women. obstetric services were moved into a newly designed facility that had entrances, elevators, and air-handling systems. staff members wore N95 respirator masks, face shields or eye protection, gowns, and non-latex gloves, and employed frequent hand washing with ethanol-based gels. women were discharged sooner after delivery, and all obstetric services considered nonessential were temporarily suspended. two antiviral medications are currently recommended for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza in humans (15) these medications, both neuraminidase inhibitors, are available in oral (oseltamivir [Tamiflu]) and inhaled (zanamivir [Relenza]) forms. two additional anti-influenza medications, the M2 ion channel blockers rimantidine and amantadine, are currently not recommended for use because of high rates of the bioavailability of zanamivir is lower (12%\u201317%) than that of oseltamivir (80%) many pregnant women will require treatment with other medications, such as antibiotics for secondary bacterial pneumonia and antipyretic medications for fever control. a vaccine will be a vital component of the public health response to pandemic influenza. pregnant women should be considered a high priority for receipt of influenza vaccine. inactivated influenza vaccine is not approved for use during pregnancy. public health professionals will have the opportunity to weigh the risks and benefits of anti-influenza medications in the context of a specific pandemic scenario. pregnant women should be considered to be high-risk in the event of an influenza pandemic."}
