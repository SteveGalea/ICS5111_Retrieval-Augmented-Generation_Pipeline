{"summary": "quantification of torque teno virus (TTV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) as biomarkers for defining the net state of immunosuppression in lung-transplanted patients. results The levels of torque teno virus DNA increased rapidly after transplantation. protocol bronchoscopies were performed at 1, 3, and 12 months post-transplantation. all BAL samples were cultured for bacteria and fungi and tested for Legionella pneumophila, Pneumocystis jirovecii, and human cytomegalovirus. the choice between CSA and TAC was made based on clinical presentation. patients previously treated with TAC and patients with cystic fibrosis were given TAC. the dosage of immunosuppression was gradually lowered during FU. recipients seropositive for CMV prior to transplantation were considered to have viremia if CMV-DNA was detected. recipients seropositive for CMV prior to transplantation were considered to have viremia only if the level was above 3.0 log10 (1000) copies/mL. a subgroup of events requiring initial intravenous antimicrobial therapy were defined as severe. the assay range was determined by serial dilution of plasmids with an insert of a synthesized sequence matching the TTV PCR product. a control sample consisting of unrelated Phocine herpesvirus 1 (PhHV-1) was included prior to nucleic acid extraction. the PCR conditions were 50\u00b0C for 2 minutes followed by 95\u00b0C for 10 minutes. Pearson\u2019s correlation and linear regression were used to evaluate the relationship between real-time PCR and ddPCR measurements. each patient was treated as a cluster to handle multiple infections occurring in a single individual. each patient was treated as a cluster to handle multiple infections occurring in a single individual. all subjects underwent follow-up (FU) visits at 1, 2, 3, 4.5, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months after transplantation. protocol bronchoscopies were performed at 1, 3, and 12 months post-transplantation. all BAL samples underwent direct microscopy for early detection of Aspergillus hyphae. prednisone 0.3 mg/kg/d and mycophenolate mofetil 2 g/d. patients then received either oral Cyclosporine (CSA; 1\u20132 mg/kg) or Tacrolimus (TAC; 0.075 mg/kg) given orally divided in 2 doses daily. patients previously treated with TAC and patients with cystic fibrosis were given TAC. VRTI or Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection was defined as detection by multiplex real-time PCR in NPH or BAL. recipients seropositive for CMV prior to transplantation were considered to have viremia only if the level was above 3.0 log10 (1000) copies/mL. the reaction conditions were 50\u00b0C for 2 minutes and 95\u00b0C for 10 minutes prior to 45 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 15 seconds and 60\u00b0C for 60 seconds. a control sample consisting of unrelated Phocine herpesvirus 1 (PhHV-1) was included prior to nucleic acid extraction. adenovirus, bocavirus, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, human coronavirus (NL63, HKU1, OC43 and 229E), human enterovirus, human metapneumovirus, human rhinovirus, influenza A virus, influenza B virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, parainfluenzavirus (1, 2, and 3), and respiratory syncytial virus. each patient was treated as a cluster to handle multiple infections occurring in a single individual 98 lung transplant recipients included in the study, of which 79 (80%) were still alive 24 months after transplantation. the total nucleic acid content was isolated from serum or whole blood samples and analyzed for respiratory pathogens. fewer patients had detectable levels of EBV-DNA prior to transplantation. fewer patients had detectable levels of EBV-DNA compared with TTV-DNA. bDonor being positive for antibodies against CMV/EBV. three patients developed suspected PTLD. no case was biopsy-verified. all were reversed upon modification of immunosuppression. patients who received either Tacrolimus- or Cyclosporine-based therapy had significantly lower TTV-DNA levels in serum at month 6 post-LTx and onwards. there was no significant difference in EBV-DNA levels in whole blood at any time point during FU. FU was divided into 4 periods, denoted q1 through q4, defined as 1\u20133 (q1), 3\u20136 (q2), 6\u201312 (q3), and 12\u201324 (q4) months after the frequency of infectious events was compared with the mean TTV-DNA or EBV-DNA levels during each period (q1\u2013q4) and the during the total FU period, respectively. no statistically significant association was found with logistic regression. age, CMV mismatch, and dominant immunosuppressive treatment did not predict outcome in any of the 4 periods denoted q1 through q4. most acute rejection events (ARs) occurred within the first 6 months post-LTx. blood-, BAL-, and nasopharyngeal samples were collected longitudinally at follow-up (FU) visits until 24 months post\u2013lung transplantation (LTx; n = 837), including pretransplant samples. total nucleic acid content was isolated from serum or whole blood samples and analyzed for respiratory pathogens. rheumatoid arthritis bronchiolitis, rheumatoid arthritis bronchiolitis. bDonor being positive for antibodies against CMV/EBV. bDonor being positive for antibodies against CMV/EBV. kinetics of torque teno virus (TTV)\u2013 and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)\u2013DNA levels in serum and whole blood respectively, before and during the follow-up period after lung transplantation. TTV-DNA levels in serum starting pre\u2013lung transplantation were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -treated patients had significantly lower TTV-DNA levels in serum at month 6 post-LTx and onwards compared with the Tacrolimus-treated patients. there was no significant difference in EBV-DNA levels in whole blood at any time point during FU. FU was divided into 4 periods, denoted q1 through q4, defined as 1\u20133 (q1), 3\u20136 (q2), 6\u201312 (q3), and 12\u201324 (q4) months after transplantation the frequency of infectious events was compared with the mean TTV-DNA or EBV-DNA levels during each period (q1\u2013q4) and the during the total FU period, respectively. no statistically significant association was found. age, CMV mismatch, and dominant immunosuppressive treatment did not predict outcome in any of the 4 periods denoted q1 through q4. most acute rejection events occurred within the first 6 months post-LTx (Figure 1). logistic regression with initial TTV-DNA or EBV-DNA for each period did not predict whether an acute rejection event would occur during that period. we found no association between the biomarkers and the risk of complications. at 3 months post-LTx, the mean TTV-DNA level peaked and gradually declined. this could mirror a different immune modulatory mechanism for Cyclosporine compared with Tacrolimus. the real-time PCR method was adequate as compared with the ddPCR method. it is considered a more reliable method for accurate quantification. real-time PCR is prone to interlaboratory differences. however, real-time PCR is prone to interlaboratory differences. ineurin inhibitor affects the TTV- but not the EBV-DNA levels. the findings should be interpreted with caution but warrant further investigation. a subgroup analysis of events requiring intravenous therapy failed to reveal any significant association between TTV- or EBV-DNA levels and infectious events. all patients received 3 months of valgangciclovir treatment initially after LTx. there are a few studies showing that valgangciclovir treatment reduces EBV load. however, no association between either TTV- or EBV-DNA load and infectious events or acute rejections suggests a limited clinical applicability.
