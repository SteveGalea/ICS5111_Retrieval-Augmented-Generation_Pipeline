{"summary": "members of the MLA Insight Initiative Task Force welcomed summit participants. participants shared their names, places of residence, professional affiliations and roles. KEYNOTE #1: ENGAGING USERS INAN ERA OF COMMODITIZATION. medical libraries are well-positioned to thrive in these uncertain times. they are focused; they want to get research done and help patients. they are respectful of expertise, seeing librarians as partners in clinical, educational, and research activities. libraries are often invisible, causing users to lose connection with librarians\u2019 expertise. a traditional university archives approach struggled to capture the story of campus growth. a traditional university archives approach struggled to capture the story of campus growth. librarians should put themselves in the role of a new student or faculty member. they should ask themselves: are our tools intuitive to use? are they convenient (i.e., low-to-no barriers\" libraries are well positioned to foster relationships across campus. they are perceived to be ecumenical problem-solvers rather than empire-builders. they are in a good position to help users have positive experiences. librarians performed a year-long study of library users to obtain evidence. they found 93% of library visitors were students and less than 3% were faculty. librarians are inserting learning objects into normal learning and research workflows. library tools and services are often invisible, causing users to lose connection with librarians\u2019 expertise. a traditional university archives approach struggled to capture the story of campus growth. he proposed a three-point plan for librarian action in an era of commoditization. one participant emphasized that librarians can't view libraries as a temple of librarians. a librarian who said he had long worked to advance interprofessional education expressed concern that different user communities are monolithic entities who engage in tribal affiliation. this librarian expressed interest in applying diversity practices to the redevelopment of library spaces and services. Lisa Janicke Hinchliffe proposed that ResearchGate \u201cgets a lot of things right\u201d. she suggested that researchGate \u201cgets a lot of things right\u201d and encouraged libraries and publishers to consider adopting some aspects of ResearchGate that are most attractive to users. she said that although new technologies \u201ccan disrupt our world, they will not put us out of business\u201d users can search for, read, and download publications easily and for free. using ResearchGate is all about \u201cyou!\u201d It allows multiple modes of engagement. users can expect quick access to portable document format files (PDFs), answers to questions. bioRxiv contains 22,000 manuscripts posted by 120,000 authors from 7,600 institutions in 104 countries. the most popular subject categories are neuroscience, bioinformatics, evolutionary biology, and genomics/genetics. bioRxiv preprints also receive a total of 115,000 tweets per year. medRxiv is a not-for-profit initiative of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. it will be integrated with external journal submission and manuscript assessment systems. medRxiv will use more rigorous approaches to mitigate risks of sharing early results. RA21 is a joint initiative of the international association of scientific, technical, and medical publishers. it aims to facilitate a seamless user experience and preserve user privacy. users increasingly access scholarly content from off-campus networks. publisher and campus pathways for providing off-network access are complex, cumbersome, and insecure. RA21 leverages a user\u2019s existing institutional credentials. the ability to block a single user account instead of an IP address. all stakeholders must make changes as RA21 rolls out. acy Services and Instruction, University of Illinois, University of Illinois\u2013Urbana-Champaign Contrary to the low opinion of ResearchGate often held by librarians and publishers, Hinchliffe proposed that ResearchGate \u201cgets a lot of things right\u201d she suggested that researchGate \u201cgets a lot of things right\u201d and encouraged libraries and publishers to consider adopting some aspects of ResearchGate that are most attractive to users. users can choose how to use ResearchGate for their own purposes. it provides a positive and encouraging environment. users often receive \u201cCongratulations!\u201d emails notifying them of personal achievements. researchGate has 13 million users and is the 260th most popular website in the world. it is considered the scholarly communication/collaboration network. there is clear competition between researchGate and libraries and publishers. bioRxiv is a preprint server for the life sciences that is modeled on the arXiv preprint server for physics and mathematics. each preprint is placed a single subject category and is labeled as \u201cnew,\u201d \u201cconfirmatory\u201d or \u201ccontradictory\u201d bioRxiv currently contains 22,000 manuscripts posted by 120,000 authors from 7,600 institutions in 104 countries. xiv preprints also receive a total of 115,000 tweets per year. 120 journals from 31 publishers allow authors to transfer their manuscript from bioRxiv to their submission systems with only \u201cone click\u201d 11 publishers allow authors to transfer a copy of their manuscript to bioRxiv upon journal submission. preprints will feature disclaimers emphasizing the lack of peer review. bioRxiv is a preprint server for the life sciences and medicine. each preprint is placed a single subject category and is labeled as \u201cnew,\u201d \u201cconfirmatory\u201d or \u201ccontradictory\u201d. bioRxiv contains 22,000 manuscripts posted by 120,000 authors from 7,600 institutions in 104 countries. the most popular subject categories are neuroscience, bioinformatics, evolutionary biology, and genomics/genetics. medRxiv is a not-for-profit initiative of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. it will be integrated with external journal submission and other manuscript assessment systems. medRxiv will use more rigorous approaches to mitigate risks of sharing early results of medical research. a new approach to authentication is needed because users increasingly access scholarly content from off-campus networks. publisher and campus pathways for providing off-network access are complex, cumbersome, and insecure. most off-campus solutions still leverage institutional IP address recognition and require user setup in advance. content providers will need changes to their websites and services. librarians will have to answer user questions and work with central campus informational technology departments. identity providers will need to build and strengthen trust. RA21 seeks to implement the same approach to authentication employed by consumer sites but with added protection of user privacy. a user can set up a Doodle account using their Google login information, but this results in Doodle having too much information about the user. additional benefits include users\u2019 ability to start their searches from their tool of choice. SMALL GROUP EXERCISE #2 Participants gathered in small groups with roughly equal representation by librarians and publishers. the groups defined broad problems, identified areas of concern or controversy, and suggested next steps. the group defined a pirate site as proactively violating copyright. a user may choose to access content through a pirate site due to ease of use. a lack of arbitrary road blocks on numbers of merited downloads, devices, or data sizes. a problem with green access and preprint servers is that there is no functionality to definitively indicate whether an article has been accepted or rejected by a journal. security and the future of IP authentication questions to consider. a user\u2019s credentials are compromised, and a vendor notices excessive downloading and requires the library to address the problem. some publishers are creating ecosystems to engage authors \"from cradle to grave\" group 5 identified several problems with IP-based authentication. changes in IP addresses must be distributed to numerous vendors, which is time-consuming for all. a single IP range can cover multiple locations, but a product license does not. a system that asks for Shibboleth or OpenAthens authentication is using jargon. a wild idea is to open all geographically defined access to a specific article based on IP addresses in a city like Birmingham, AL, or Lincoln, NE, when it is needed for a journal club or similar purpose. there is likely a finite lifespan for pirate sites because they will not add value when most or all content is open. there is a threat to both IP owners and libraries when users fail to recognize where content and value come from. a user may choose to access content through a pirate site due to its ease of use. group 3 group 3 believed that the benefits of pirate sites were their ease of use and quick results. we considered some solutions to the problem of difficult access to scholarly information. a tool that provides a workflow for accessing a PDF through potential sources. a user may choose to access content through a pirate site due to ease of use. a lack of arbitrary road blocks on numbers of merited downloads, devices, or data sizes. the difference between SciHub and other file-sharing platforms is that SciHub actively breaks down barriers with criminal or at least malicious intent by subverting authentication procedures and downloading content en masse. a user's credentials are compromised, and a vendor notices excessive downloading and requires the library to address the problem or risk loss of access. some publishers are creating ecosystems to engage authors \u201cfrom cradle to grave\u201d with the hope of forming \u201csticky\u201d partnerships with future content-generators and thereby establishing lifelong brand loyalty. libraries and their technical staff are not able to adopt new authentication standards very quickly, leaving vendors to support many different systems and standards. libraries get frustrated because a product \u201cdoesn\u2019t work,\u201d although the problem may be out of the vendor\u2019s control. a wild idea is to open all geographically defined access to a specific article based on IP addresses in a city like Birmingham, AL, or Lincoln, NE. if a user geolocates to a licensed major institution area, then they should be able to access the resource. a federated identity could solve some access problems, but a trusted identity provider is required. some publishers are creating ecosystems to engage authors \"from cradle to grave\" some publishers in our group admitted that they feared the consolidation of libraries, publishers, and health care organizations. some publishers admitted that they feared the consolidation of libraries, publishers, and health care organizations. a hospital librarian in group 6 worried about users being unable to access content. some users download a single copy from a vendor and store it on a local network for others to access. a system that asks for Shibboleth or OpenAthens authentication is using jargon and talking \"insider baseball\" Ruth Pickering, co-founder and chief strategy and business development officer, Yewno, Redwood City, CA. she described a new approach to making search results more meaningful and adaptable to a user\u2019s specific needs. the new version of Yewno presents clearer graphs and more structured results. Yewno complements databases by recreating how the human brain works on an enormous scale. the field is expected to be main driver of productivity and economic growth for at least the next twenty years. pickering demonstrated Yewno in use. Yewno Life Sciences can help researchers make connections between diseases and drug targets in biological systems. users can see actions performed by users such as viewing snippets, adding or removing concepts, reading articles, and sharing their results. users can filter Yewno search results to show only content available through their institutions. a librarian said that a sufficiently large body of content would serve to place controversies into perspective. another librarian asked whether the age of the content was considered by Yewno algorithms. a publisher asked whether the semantics used by Yewno were dynamic. Ruth Pickering first described the history of a new idea for information discovery. she described a new approach to making search results more meaningful and adaptable to a user\u2019s specific needs. a similar approach could be used as an interdisciplinary discovery tool. Yewno complements databases by recreating how the human brain works on an enormous scale. it is expected to be main driver of productivity and economic growth for at least the next twenty years. pickering has heard a range of publisher reactions to AI. users can see actions performed by users such as viewing snippets, adding or removing concepts, reading articles, and sharing their results. they can also see which concepts, topics, and disciplines are most highly explored and which documents from various publishers are most frequently accessed. a librarian asked whether the age of the content was considered by Yewno algorithms. a publisher asked whether the semantics used by Yewno were dynamic. a final set of questions addressed whether Yewno might be too difficult or too easy to use. the primary IL challenge facing faculty is predatory journals that lure in authors desperate to publish in order to achieve promotion or tenure. librarians\u2019 solution is to teach faculty how to distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate journals and seek to dispel the myth that open access publishing is equivalent to predatory publishing. librarian-faculty relationships have catalyzed their integration into the curriculum. this paradigm shift poses challenges to librarians, but these challenges can be transformed into opportunities. one challenge is a structural challenge. il should be redefined as a high-value skill set with an impact on lifelong learning and career success. students should have an awareness of what IL skills are and how these skills will be assessed. a big assignment can be broken into smaller steps, each aligned to a learning outcome. the internet is now the most utilized information resource for both health care providers and patients. the vast majority (86%) of physicians use the Internet to gather medical and pharmaceutical information. the vast majority (86%) of physicians use the Internet to gather medical and pharmaceutical information, with fewer relying on resources such as online continuing medical education. altmetrics can be more revealing of the impact of scholarly research than traditional impact metrics. some doctors send emails to their patients with information about new treatments. others may share information from journal articles with their patients on social media platforms. IL is \"not just about how to search and how to cite,\" says a researcher. a librarian asked how publishers educate authors about using social media to attract an audience for their work. a librarian responded that publishers could create \"small chunks\" of materials. librarians have received positive emails from faculty, some boasting about their ability to identify email solicitations from predatory journals. primary challenge facing medical students is their use of non-authoritative (e.g., Google) or inappropriate (e.g., consumer health websites) resources to answer patient-based questions. goal is to train students to use EBM resources when answering clinical questions. the primary IL challenge facing faculty is predatory journals that lure in authors who are desperate to publish. librarians' solution is to teach faculty how to distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate journals. goal is to help faculty see librarians as partners in the publishing process. a paradigm shift in higher education has led to student success in IL. this paradigm shift poses challenges to librarians, but with the right approach, these challenges can be transformed into opportunities. one challenge is a structural challenge, a challenge pertains to faculty perceptions of IL and librarians. a librarian should work toward an embedded model in which they go into classes repeatedly and help scaffold IL skills into courses or programs. a big assignment can be broken into smaller steps, each aligned to an IL learning outcome. reframe the value of the library. a paradigm shift poses challenges to librarians, but with the right approach, these challenges can be transformed into opportunities. il is a skill that is built and mastered over time, according to DiFeterici. il should be redefined as a high-value skill set with an impact on lifelong learning and career success. in-class time could be used to help students dig into databases. out-of-class time could be supplemented with videos and tutorials. reframe the value of the library. the Internet is now the most utilized information resource for both health care providers and patients. the vast majority (86%) of physicians use the Internet to gather medical and pharmaceutical information, with less relying on resources such as online continuing medical education. the internet is now the most utilized information resource for both health care providers and patients. the vast majority (86%) of physicians use the Internet to gather medical and pharmaceutical information. the vast majority (86%) of physicians use the Internet to gather medical and pharmaceutical information. altmetric data showed that his article was tweeted over 800 times. he has received only one traditional citation. this case exemplifies how technology revolutions are changing communication between physicians and patients. librarian says libraries have to make connection between IL and digital literacy by using tools such as the Association of College & Research Libraries\u2019 Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education. another topic of discussion was the need for publishers and librarians to work together to develop resources for authors for promoting their work online and using altmetrics. if all publishers cannot work together on a discovery tool, there is still a problem in discovery. if all publishers cannot work together on a discovery tool, then there is still a problem in discovery. a good librarian will use multiple platforms including PubMed and publisher databases to perform a comprehensive search. the value of discovery tools to the user comes from saving time, learning about new information resources, filtering results, and identifying gaps in research that could be fruitful areas for future publication. the value of discovery tools to the user comes from saving time, learning about new information resources, having the ability to filter results. librarians are in a unique position to provide training on discovery tools. we believe that librarians are in a unique position to provide training on discovery tools. librarians should have ongoing conversations with user communities to elucidate desired features in discovery tools. group 5 Our group joked that an ideal social networking site for collaboration and sharing would be a \u201cFacebook for scientists\u201d some librarians suggested publishers could authorize temporary access to full-text articles to facilitate access for journal clubs, which could help avoid copyright issues. a successful outcome would be an increase in the number and diversity of authors on papers. an ideal platform would solve some problems of illegitimate file sharing by incorporating the sharing of links in accordance with RA21 and STM guidelines. a good librarian will use multiple platforms including PubMed and publisher databases to perform a comprehensive search. if medical students are taught to use a subscription-based search tool, then they are handicapped when they are residents at an institution that does not have access to that tool. a good librarian will use multiple platforms including PubMed and publisher databases to perform a comprehensive search. a \u201cspecialized discovery tool\u201d would attract patrons to the library\u2019s website if they were not already library users. the search results interface should map to a subject area librarian who has the expertise to guide the user along another discovery path if the search results do not meet the user\u2019s expectations. if all publishers cannot work together on a discovery tool, there is still a problem in discovery. if all publishers cannot work together on a discovery tool, then there is still a problem in discovery. librarians in our group said they must trust a search tool to gather all relevant and important information. the value of discovery tools to the user comes from saving time, learning about new information resources, filtering results, and identifying gaps in research that could be fruitful areas for future publication. the value of discovery tools to the user comes from saving time,

ideal social networking site for collaboration and sharing would be a \u201cFacebook for scientists\u201d many social media sites and chat tools are blocked due to HIPAA concerns. some librarians suggested publishers could authorize temporary access to full-text articles to facilitate access for journal clubs. a successful outcome would be an increase in the number and diversity of authors on papers. a successful outcome would be an increase in the number and diversity of authors on papers. the role of libraries is to facilitate, mediate, and teach users about these tools, with overall ownership of the endeavor residing elsewhere in the institution. group 5 Our group joked that an ideal social networking site for collaboration and sharing would be a \u201cFacebook for scientists\u201d some librarians suggested publishers could authorize temporary access to full-text articles to facilitate access for journal clubs, which could help avoid copyright issues. an ideal platform would have the following characteristics: Broadly defined scholarly membership: Silos of research are not conducive to new discovery; there must be structures that encourage multidisciplinary interaction and serendipity. new platforms that increase the administrative burden of university and hospital information professionals will not work. how should libraries and publishers start preparing for a fragmented market\" how should the publishing industry and libraries deal with the threats of no more IP authentication and everything being open access. do librarians and publishers have a shared responsibility to educate users on authority and misinformation. participants identified key questions that could impact their work or their organizations' strategies. the summit could stimulate the creation of durable materials to advance the causes of user engagement and medical libraries. can publishers and publishers cocreate digital literacy programs and author guides on content sharing, copyright, and related issues. how can we increase focus on assessment and analytics from both library and publisher sides. how can we make it easier or more desirable for users to employ legitimate means of access to combat piracy\" librarians and publishers can cocreate digital literacy programs and author guides on content sharing, copyright, and related issues. how can we increase focus on assessment and analytics from both library and publisher sides. security and the future of IP authentication Michael A.
