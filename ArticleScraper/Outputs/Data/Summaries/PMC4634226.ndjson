{"summary": "influenza (Flu) virus is the most common cause of influenzalike illness (ILI) in adults. they usually present as abrupt, selflimited febrile infections that occur in outbreaks almost every winter. the attack rates during such periods have been reported to be as high as 10\u201340%. adult outpatients with ILI attending the emergency room of a university hospital in Buenos Aires, Argentina were included. these periods corresponded to the 18\u201339 and 24\u201334 epidemiological weeks. the patients who gathered the inclusion criteria were invited to read and sign the informed consent. flu subtyping flu positive samples were sent to the national center of Influenza (INESANLIS Carlos G. Malbr\u00e1n) for characterization of the strains by hemoagglutinationinhibition test. chisquare test was used to analyze continuous variables and chisquare test for categorical ones. Virological studies Samples were processed by IIF with monoclonal antibodies (Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA) for flu A, flu B, parainfluenza, adenovirus and RSV. all samples (n = 151) were tested by IIF and RTPCR for hMPV detection. characterization was achieved in 13 samples only, 11 Flu A and 2 Flu B. characterization was achieved in 13 samples only, 11 flu A and 2 flu B. clinical data The mean age of the patients was 366 years (SD 136), predominantly female (60%). there were no statistical differences between the positive and negative groups regarding sex or age. clinical management Only one flu positive patient received empirical oseltamivir at the emergency room because she had a renal transplant and was under immunosuppressive treatment. the rest of the patients consulted in an average of 43 hours after the symptoms started. hMPV na na 1 (2) na 1 (1) na 2 (13) Values are given as n (%). na, not applicable; nd, not done. characterization was achieved in 13 samples only, 11 flu A and 2 flu B. male sex 60 (40%) 43 (45%) 18 (33%) Age (years) 366 (SD 136) Time to consult (hours) 43 (SD 20) 46 (SD 20) 40 (SD 21) Immunocompromised individuals 14 (9%) 11 (7%) 2 (1%) Vaccination for influenza 12 (8%) 10 (7%) 2 (4%) Signs and symptoms Fever 151 (100%) 96 (100%) 55 (100%) Pharyngeal pain 99 (65%) 62 (64%) 38% of young adult outpatients with ILI had a viral etiology. 33% corresponded to Flu virus followed by RSV. other studies have shown similar or even lower viral detection in young adults. most of the patients consulted after 48 hours of the onset of symptoms. viral etiology allowed infection control measures, like patient isolation. most of flu strains from our patients were similar to the corresponding vaccine strains for the correspondent year. g J, Groen J et al.
