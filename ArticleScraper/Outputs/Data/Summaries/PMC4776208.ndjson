{"summary": "the international agency for research on cancer lists several biological species with carcinogenic potential in humans. this list comprises a bacterium (species Helicobacter pylori), three parasitic flukes (Clonorchis sinensis, Opisthorchis viverrini and Schistosoma haematobium) and seven viruses: human papillomaviruses (HPV), human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), Epstein our method compares samples and establishes recurrence prior to taxonomic characterisation of the sequences. the method has conceptual similarities to the work of Andreatta et al.

ORs above 1 indicate association between the presence of the AR virus and the use of the ScriptSeq kit. the clustering with parameter settings c080aS030G0 had a very broad range of ORs corresponding to a skewed clustering. the species evenness index is a score that derives from the Shannon\u2019s diversity index. an index of zero is assigned to clusters that are constituted uniquely by contigs mapping to a single species. a block of parameters using global alignment mode, alignment length based on shortest sequence, 90% minimal sequence identity, and a minimum alignment length of 80/85/90/95/99% of the shortest sequence (c090aSyG1) all had a median species evenness of 0. This group of parameter settings also showed desirable performance in terms of OR. the significant associations were arranged in 6165 unique clusters and with 73 unique features. the distribution of the significant associations showed that recurrent sequences originated from diverse sources and that individual clusters often associated to more than one feature. the p-values are arranged by feature of the strongest significant association of each of the 6165 unique clusters. the 50 features involved as strongest associations have been coloured by type: biological (red), methodological (green), and technical (blue) the 6165 clusters were mapped using BLASTn and BLASTx. this resulted in a taxonomical annotation of 3553 clusters using BLASTn. a total of 1524 unique species were annotated corresponding to 5183 clusters. a cluster significantly associated to vulva cancer annotated as species Campylobacter ureolyticus (p-value = 1.03e-12), an inhabitant of the urogenital tract. the clusters are significantly associated with lowest p-values to biological features and the species annotations are described by HMP. cancer Filifactor alocis 2 4.12e-11 Oral cavity cancer Streptococcus dysgalactiae 1 4.85e-11 Oral Vulva cancer Campylobacter ureolyticus 1 1.03e-12 Urogenital tract In the methodological associations, we correctly detected the strong known association (p-value: 3.04e-89) of avian myeloblastosis-associated virus (accession L10922.1) used in the manufacture of the most associations were methodological (Table 1), probably sourcing from nucleotide sequences. out of the 868 methodologically associated clusters, there were 648 associated clusters to the laboratory reagent DNase/RNase: Promega DNase stop solution (minimum p-value: 2.40e-36 in feature 383) all cluster representatives could be explained as commensal bacteria related to the oral cavity as described by HMP. the cluster representatives were identified as: Prevotella veroralis, Prevotella veroralis, Prevotella fusca JCM 17724, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius as the best hits. cluster representative BLASTn BLASTx CCD 1789 bp - Prevotella veroralis (WP_026284690.1) 92% / 42% - 3246 bp Prevotella veroralis (WP_004384161.1) 76% / 18% Prevotella veroralis (WP_004384161.1) 90% / 56% DUF4280 super family (cl16620) TauE super family (cl a configuration encoded C090aS090G1 would represent a clustering that requires global alignments with a 90% minimum sequence identity over 90% of the length of the shortest contig. we chose the parameters based on the performance of the clustering of expected contaminant sequences from avian leukosis virus [37] ORs above 1 indicate association between the presence of the AR virus and the use of the ScriptSeq kit. the largest differences observed were between usages of the shortest or longest sequence in alignments with the alignment length filter. the clustering with parameter settings c080aS030G0 had an overall high range of ORs as well as the highest minimum values. parameter settings c080aL030G1 generally had a high level of species evenness (median 0.73) in clusters. a block of parameters using global alignment mode, alignment length based on shortest sequence, 90% minimal sequence identity, and a minimum alignment length of 80/85/90/95/99% of the shortest sequence (c090aSyG1) all had a median species evenness of 0. the 6165 strongest associations were distributed according to 602 biological, 5045 methodological and 518 technical associations. most p-values were above 1e-24 and associations with lower p-values were to several methods annotated as extraction kits. the p-values are arranged by feature of the strongest significant association of each of the 6165 clusters. the boxes span the first and third quartiles. the whiskers of the boxes extend to the lowest and highest values within a distance of 1.5 times the interquartile range. a total of 1524 unique species were annotated corresponding to 5183 clusters. a total of 1524 unique species were annotated corresponding to 5183 clusters. the clusters are significantly associated with lowest p-values to biological features and the species annotations are described by HMP. the lowest p-value of associations is given #sig: number of significant clusters. we correctly detected the strong known association (p-value: 3.04e-89) of avian myeloblastosis-associated virus (accession L10922.1) used in the manufacture of the ScriptSeq v2 RNA-Seq library preparation kit (f089). a single cluster annotated as NCBI taxonomy species Parvovirus NIH-CQV (accession KC617868.1;
