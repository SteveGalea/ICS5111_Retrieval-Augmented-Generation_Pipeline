{"summary": "the first outbreak of PED was recognized in England in 1971. the disease has rapidly spread to Asia and, subsequently, to North America. a new generation of PEDV vaccine against G2b PEDV is urgently required. highly-passaged cell culture strain CV777 presents transient or no fecal viral shedding without clinical symptoms. sows intramuscularly immunized with 107 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50)/mL of highly-passaged cell culture strain twice every two weeks induces serum and colostrum antibody titers. we orally inoculated 5-week-old, PEDV-seronegative conventional pigs with a low-passage (passage 5; PEDVPT-P5) or high-passage (passage 96; PEDVPT-P96) PEDV strain was isolated in early 2014 from the intestinal homogenate of a 7-day-old suckling pig. viral stocks of the low-passage PEDV (passage 5; PEDVPT-P5) strain and the high-passage PEDV (passage 96; PEDVPT-P96) strain were prepared by serial passaging of the culture supernatants in vero cells. the viral titers of the PEDVPT-P5 and PEDVPT-P96 stocks were 105 and 106 TCID50/mL respectively. labeled goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) diluted to 200-fold in PBS was added to each well. each well was washed three times with PBS. labeled cells were exposed to 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine (DAB) chromogen. PT-P5 challenge (pigs A4 to A3; n = 3), mock-inoculated group without PEDVPT-P5 challenge (pigs B1 to B6; n = 3), mock-inoculated group with PEDVPT-P5 challenge (pigs C1 to C6; n = 6) all pigs were labeled with ear tags; three pigs of the same group were housed in a separate room. ated pigs were orally inoculated with 5 mL of 105 TCID50/mL of PEDVPT-P5 to evaluate immune protection. all pigs were 9-weeks old. all pigs were 9-weeks old. the detection limit of RT-qPCR was approximately 60 GE of DNA. samples with a melting temperature of 84.7\u201386.1 \u00b0C were considered PEDV positive. the efficiency of the qPCR ranged from 90.42 to 96.92%. yringe-filtered (0.22 m pore size) fecal samples were diluted two-fold in PBS. each sample was added to the plate in duplicates. antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated goat anti-pig IgG (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories), diluted to 1:1000. 50 microliters of diluted plasma samples were admixed and incubated with 200 TCID50/mL PEDVPT-P5 at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 1 h. mixtures containing PEDVPT-P5 and different diluted plasma were added to vero cells in duplicates and were replaced by fresh PI medium. the cells were maintained at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 1 h. the results of body weights, antibody titers, and fecal viral shedding were analyzed statistically using SAS 9.4 (Statistical Analysis System, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) a p-value of 0.05 was interpreted as statistically significant. viral stocks of the low-passage PEDV (passage 5; PEDVPT-P5) strain and the high-passage PEDV (passage 96; PEDVPT-P96) strain were prepared by serial passaging of the culture supernatants in vero cells. the viral titers of the PEDVPT-P5 and PEDVPT-P96 stocks were 105 and 106 TCID50/mL respectively. polyclonal anti-rabbit/mouse immunoglobulin EnVision-DAB+ system was used according to manufacturer's protocol. labeled cells were exposed to 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine (DAB) chromogen. stained cells were detected using an inverted light/fluorescence microscope. PEDVPT-P5 challenge (pigs A4 to A6; n = 3), the PEDVPT-P5-inoculated group with PEDVPT-P5 challenge (pigs C1 to C6; n = 6), and the PEDVPT-P96-inoculated group with PEDVPT-P5 challenge (pigs C1 to C6; n = 6) all pigs were labeled with ear tags. pigs were orally inoculated with 5 mL of 105 TCID50/mL of PEDVPT-P5. the weight of individual pigs in each group was monitored and recorded weekly. cDNA was amplified by real-time qPCR using the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit. plasmid containing the PEDV N gene was used as the positive control to generate a standard curve. the detection limit of RT-qPCR was approximately 60 GE of DNA. the amplification product for each reaction was also confirmed by performing the melting curve assay. each fecal swab was diluted in 700 L PBS. antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated goat anti-pig IgG (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) diluted to 1:1000 or goat-anti-pig IgA (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) diluted to 1:5000. microliters of diluted plasma samples were admixed and incubated with 200 TCID50/mL PEDVPT-P5 at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 1 h. mixtures containing PEDVPT-P5 and different diluted plasma were added to vero cells in duplicates. after 1 h of incubation, the cells were replaced by fresh PI medium. p-value of 0.05 was interpreted as statistically significant. negative, PEDV-specific cytoplasmic signals in cytopathic syncytial cells were detected by IFA using pig hyperimmune serum (Figure 1B) and by ICC using a monoclonal anti-PEDV N antibody (Figure 1C). most pigs in the PEDVPT-P5-inoculated group presented with typical PEDV-associated, loose-to-watery diarrhea. with the exception of two pigs, most pigs in this group presented with typical PEDV-associated, loose-to-watery diarrhea (score = 1) at 2\u20133 days post-inoculation (DPI) that worsened to watery diarrhea (score = 3) at 3\u20137 DPI and eventually ameliorated to loose diarrhea 0 0 1 3 3 3 2 1 0 A2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ally inoculated with post-inoculation (PI) medium, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus strain Pintung 52 (PEDVPT)-P5 or PEDVPT-P96 at 5-weeks old. later re-challenged or challenged with PEDVPT-P5 at 9-weeks old. no significant differences in weight gain were observed among all groups. fecal viral shedding in PEDVPT-P5- and PEDVPT-P96-inoculated pigs was determined using RT-qPCR. the changes and the length of fecal viral shedding in the mock-inoculated group were determined using RT-qPCR. the threshold indicates the limitation of detection for the SYBR Green-based real-time PCR. the black, gray, and dashed lines illustrate the results obtained for the PEDVPT-P96-inoculated group, PEDVPT-P5-inoculated group, and mock-infected group. a weak but detectable elevation of mean S/P ratios for PEDV-specific IgA (0.31) was observed in both PEDVPT-P5 and PEDVPT-P96-inoculated pigs as early as at 14 DPI. changes in PEDV-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels in plasma after PEDVPT-P5 or PEDVPT-P96 inoculation. changes in PEDV-specific mucosal IgA levels obtained from fecal swabs. each fecal swab was diluted with 700 L PBS and filtered. the levels of PEDV-specific IgA were detected by ELISA. plasma samples were collected from 5- and 9-week-old pigs. values are represented as mean SEM. three pigs (A1\u2013A3) challenged with PEDVPT-P5. the clinical signs of infection, fecal viral shedding, and plasma IgG values of the other three pigs in mock group (A4\u2013A6) not challenged were undetectable during the experiment. the threshold indicates the limitation of detection by the SYBR Green-based RT-PCR. the complete genome sequence of both PEDVPT-P5 and PEDVPT-P96 was 28,038 nucleotides (nt) in length, excluding the 3\u2032 poly(A) tail. no deletion or insertion was detected on comparing PEDVPT-P96 with PEDVPT-P96. NSP2 (K159N and T510I), NSP3 (F669S), NSP4 (E421A) and NSP15 (M252I) genes harbored one aa substitution (Y170H) yncytial cells were detected by IFA using pig hyperimmune serum (Figure 1B) and by ICC using a monoclonal anti-PEDV N antibody (Figure 1C) no CPE and positive PEDV antigen signals were detected in Vero cells not inoculated with media containing PEDVPT. the animal was diagnosed with a poor prognosis and immediately euthanized. most pigs in the PEDVPT-P96-inoculated group showed no obvious clinical signs of infection with the exception of two pigs. 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 inoculated pigs showed a relative decrease in body weight gain compared to other groups in the first two weeks post-inoculation. no significant differences in weight gain were observed among all groups in the study. the average viral shedding in the PEDVPT-P96-inoculated group started at 4 DPI, exhibited a lower peak viral load (4.57 log10 GE) the average viral shedding in the group started at 4 DPI, exhibited a lower peak viral load that was continuously detected until 21 DPI. plasma IgG and fecal IgA levels were measured in pigs at 0, 14, and 28 DPI. Elevated PEDV-specific IgG level was detected in all PEDVPT-P5- and PEDVPT-P96-inoculated pigs at 14 DPI, which reached a plateau at 28 DPI. plasma samples from ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-anticoagulated blood were collected biweekly and diluted 20-fold. levels of PEDV-specific IgG were detected by ELISA with PEDV particles as coating antigen and expressed as sample-to-positive control ratios. the black, gray, and dashed lines illustrate the results of the PEDVPT-P96-inoculated group, PEDVPT-P5-inoculated group, and mock-infected group. values of PEDV-specific neutralizing antibody titers in all animals harbored a background titer of 20-fold at 0 and 27 DPI. three pigs (A1\u2013A3) challenged with PEDVPT-P5 started to develop loose diarrhea at 2 DPC that worsened to watery diarrhea at 3\u20135 DPC. all pigs in both PEDVPT-P5- and PEDVPT-P96-inoculated groups were challenged with 5 mL of 105 TCID50/mL of PEDVPT-P5 at 27 DPI. three out of six pigs showed clinical loose feces (score = 1) at one time point. a single time point of low-level of fecal viral shedding was detected at 9 DPC. in all pigs, no detectable increases in mean values for plasma PEDV-specific IgG S/P ratios were noted after the challenge. the resultant 19 amino acid (aa) substitutions were revealed. the S and M genes appeared to be the most variable. each contained nine (T144I, F554S, S887R, S968A, I1021S, R1026K, L1252R, C1354F, C1358F) and three (I12V, S79A, F145L) changes. PEDVPT-P5-inoculated pigs showed a delayed, mild, and transient diarrhea, or in some cases undetectable, providing evidence of viral attenuation. study provides valuable information regarding the viral shedding period, immunogenicity, and pathogenicity of different passaged PEDV in conventional post-weaning pigs. PEDVPT-P96 can infect seronegative pigs of all ages. but the susceptibility to PEDV infection is age-dependent. it is significantly higher in neonatal pigs than in weaning pigs. it has been reported that oral fluid samples are suitable for screening PEDV. cal viral shedding primarily during the first two weeks with a peak at 5\u20136 DPI and fecal swabs that were positive for PEDV nucleic acid at 21 and 28 DPI in some pigs. the spike sequence of the USA/KS/2013 isolate was compared to the Taiwan PEDVPT isolate. a novel vaccine against these new strains is urgently needed. aa substitutions of F669S in the NSP3 gene and M252I in the NSP15 gene were identified in PEDVPT-P96. the results of in vivo animal challenge performed in this study suggest this mutation does not result in the loss of the cross-protection against the parental PEDVPT-P5 strain. 3 genes tend to comprise more mutations through PEDV attenuation. only one non-silent mutation was observed in each gene in the present study. this information is invaluable for further rapid and rational development of effective and genetically stable vaccines via reverse genetics. immunogenicity of different passages of cell-adapted PEDV in conventional pigs."}
