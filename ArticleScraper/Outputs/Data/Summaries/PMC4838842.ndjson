{"summary": "we first tested the toxicity of RSV in HepG2.2.15 cells and determined the optimal dose for the later treatment. the 50% inhibitory concentration of cell viability was 106.3 M and then the 50 M was an effective concentration chosen for the following experiments of RSV. RSV increased supernatant HBV DNA contents in Huh7 cells transfected with pHBV. expression data was normalized to vehicle control (NC) 6 g of 1.3 HBV-Cp-Luc plasmid DNA was hydromatically injected into the mice. 72 hours later, the mice were treated with RSV for 20 minutes. the activity of the core promoter in mice liver was measured in real time. the gels have been run under the same experimental conditions. PPAR/RXR enhances HBV transcription via PPAR/RXR activation. we knocked down various HBV-related transcriptional factors. we measured the expression of PPAR/RXR target genes by RT-qPCR. the mRNA expression of the PPAR/RXR targets in HepG2.2.15 cells and the mouse liver was measured by RT-qPCR. to examine whether Sirt1 contributes to RSV-induced HBV replication, we measured HBV DNA in the culture media from Sirt1 knockdown cells. Knockdown of Sirt1 significantly decreased the HBV DNA levels by almost 80% compared to the control. silencing of Sirt1 inhibited the effect of RSV on viral core promoter activity in HepG2 cells. cells were cotransfected with pGL3-Cp and pRL-TK plasmids for 24 hours. all experiments were repeated at least three times with consistent results. silencing of PGC-1 inhibited the effect of RSV on supernatant HBV DNA level (filled bars) in HepG2 cells. knockdown of PGC-1 significantly reduced RSV-stimulated core promoter activity. PPAR activation is required for fasting-induced HBV transcription in vivo. luciferase analysis of all mice was performed at baseline and at indicated times of fasting. PPAR target genes encoding FP2ase, CYP 4A14 and mHMG-CoAs were measured by RT-qPCR at indicated times of fasting. inhibition of PPAR by GW6471 prevented fasting-induced activity of the viral core promoter. serum HBV DNA levels were significantly increased and maintained at a higher level towards the end point of the drug administration. serum HBV DNA levels were significantly increased and maintained at a higher level towards the end point of the drug administration. RNA and preC RNA levels by almost 6-fold and 4-fold respectively, but also HBeAg and HBcAg levels by nearly 5-fold and 3-fold respectively. this suggests that the transcription of HBV DNA was activated by the RSV treatment, especially at the region of viral core promoter. the cropped blots are used in the figure and full-length blots are presented in Supplementary Figure 1a. the expression levels of HBcAg in the mouse liver were shown by using Western blot (b) and immunohistochemistry (c), HBcAg Brown staining. magnification 20) knockdown of PPAR or RXR abolished RSV-induced HBV replication. knockdown of PPAR or RXR reduced the luciferase signal of the core promoter. PPAR/RXR stimulated the expression of PPAR target genes promoting fatty acid oxidation. mRNA expression of PPAR/RXR targets in hepG2 cells was measured by RT-qPCR. all experiments were repeated at least three times with consistent results. the cropped blots are used in the figure and full-length blots are presented in Supplementary Figure 2a,b. the cropped blots are used in the figure and are presented in Supplementary Figure 2c. RSV treatment significantly decreased the acetylation level of PGC-1 protein in HepG2.2.15 cells. pretreatment of nicotinamide restored the acetylated PGC-1 level to that of the untreated group. gene silencing of PGC-1 inhibited the effect of RSV on supernatant HBV DNA level (filled bars) in HepG2.2.15 cells. the gels have been run under same experimental conditions. AR inhibitor significantly blocked the enhanced activity of the viral core promoter by fasting in the time course of starvation. PPAR activation is required for fasting-induced HBV transcription in vivo. RSV exists in a number of fruits such as red grapes (50\u2013100 mg/g)45 and drinks such as red wine (0.2 mg/l to 5.8 mg/l)46 at notable concentrations. patients with HBV infection, especially HBV carriers, would have a risk of HBV recurrence when drinking over-dosed red wine. RSV-induced Sirt1 activation mediates HBV transcription. inhibition of Sirt1 by NAM attenuates this effect, suggesting that activation of Sirt1 is required for RSV-induced HBV replication. the most likely explanation is that RSV has both Sirt1-dependent and independent functions50. RSV activates Sirt1 and enhances HBV replication through its core promoter. the activated PPAR/RXR complex then coactivates PPAR/RXR. this resembles the pathway of fasting-induced FAO and HBV replication. mice received either RSV (100 mg/kg mouse body weight) or vehicle (water) by oral gavage every day for 2 weeks. mice were sacrificed at 35 and 42 days after injection. mice with HBV-Cp-Luc plasmid were administered acute intraperitoneal injection 30 min prior to defined fasting time points. another 30 mice (divided into 5 groups: 0 h, fasting 7 h, fasting 24 h, fasting 48 h, refed, n = 6) were killed.
