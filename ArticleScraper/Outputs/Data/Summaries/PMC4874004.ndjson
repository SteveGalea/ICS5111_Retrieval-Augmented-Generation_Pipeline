{"summary": "chemokine receptors CXCR3, CXCR5, and CCR7 were detected on CD19+ cells isolated from the brain during MCMV infection. in vivo and in vitro experiments investigated role of reactive glial cells in recruitment and survival of B-lineage cells in response to MCMV infection. neutralizing Abs to CXCL9 and CXCL10 inhibited this migration. proliferation of brain-infiltrating B cells was detected at 7 days post infection. astrocytes produce B cell activating factor of the TNF family."}
