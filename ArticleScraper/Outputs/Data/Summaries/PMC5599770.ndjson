{"summary": "a bivalent recombinant gp120 subunit vaccine was given concurrently with the last two injections of ALVAC-HIV. RV144 had 31% efficacy to prevent HIV-1 infection in vaccine recipients. the booster component of the vaccine (AIDSVAX B/E) was a modified form of HIV gp120 with its first 40 amino acids replaced by the signal sequence and the N-terminal 11 amino acids of the mature form of gp120. AIDSVAX B/E has the first 27 amino acids of the mature form of HSV-1 gD fused to gp120 without the first 40 amino acids of gp120. HSV-1 gD amino acids recognized by MAb CH42 and CH43 were determined by binding the MAbs to peptides containing alanine substitution mutations. AIDSVAX B/E contains the first 27 amino acids of the mature form of HSV-1 gD bind to HVEM (14, 15), while side chains of exposed amino acids interact with nectin-1 (16) the roles of HVEM and nectin-1 in HSV infection have been studied in mice with the two virus receptors knocked out (17\u201320) the MAbs were expressed in 293T cells transfected with IgH and IgL gene constructs. of nine heavy chains isolated, seven were specific for the HSV-1 gD peptide. two MAbs, CH42 and CH43, that showed strong binding to gD peptide were selected. HSV-2 showed nearly 100% amino acid identity. most of the amino acid differences were due to changes in the sequence of HSV-2 gD. the MAb CH42 binding epitope was identical to the sequence of HSV-1 gD. -1 infection by 50% at a 1:556 dilution in B78H1-A10 cells. the human IgG1 isotype control antibody A32 did not neutralize the viruses. human IVIG was able to neutralize HSV-2 infection of both B78H1-A10 and B78H1-C10 cells. 50% neutralizing titers were observed at 1:141 and 1:71 dilutions. previously, HVEM from vero cells was less effective than human HVEM in supporting HSV-2 infection. CH42 and CH43 neutralized 50% of HSV-1 infection of HFF. both MAbs CH42 and CH43 can neutralize HSV-1 entry mediated by human HVEM. ADCC is mediated by effector cells in response to virus-specific antibodies bound to viral antigens. 5% of NK-92-CD16 cells expressed CD107a on their surfaces. the percentages of activated NK-92-CD16 cells induced by isotype control antibody A32 were comparable in the presence or absence of HSV-1 infection. the relatively high background with the isotype control MAb was not HSV-1 specific. cell surface CD107a staining was performed as a marker of NK cell activation. the percentages of NK-92-CD16 cells expressed CD107a on their surfaces are shown on the y axis. the error bars indicate standard deviations. mice treated with gD MAbs CH42 and CH43 showed maximum NK cell activation at 0.5 g/ml and 5 g/ml respectively. mice receiving 30 g or more of CH42 or CH43 or 5 mg of human IVIG had 100% survival after HSV-1 inoculation. mice receiving g or more of CH42 or CH43 or 5 mg of human IVIG had corneal scarification. both CH42 and CH43 significantly reduced ocular disease compared with isotype control antibody A32. reduction in ocular disease was dose dependent for both HSV MAbs. correlation of ocular disease with dose of each antibody was statistically significant. shedding from eyes of mice treated with MAb CH42, CH43, or isotype control (A32) and infected with HSV-1 by corneal scarification. mice were treated and infected as described in the legend to Fig. 4. each point represents the results for one mouse. the HSV-1 MAbs protected mice from lethal infection, reduced ocular disease, and modestly reduced virus shedding and latency of virus in trigeminal ganglia compared with isotype control antibody. mice not infected with HSV-1 (No inf) served as a negative control. gD binding epitopes for MAbs CH42 and CH43 were mapped using alanine scanning mutagenesis. MAb CH42 recognizes amino acids 12 to 16 (ADPNR) and CH43 recognizes amino acids 17, 21, and 22 (FXXXDL) HSV-2 gD MAbs CH42 and CH43 neutralize HSV-1 infection in cells expressing human HVEM, but not nectin-1. both MAbs CH42 and CH43 neutralized HSV-1 infection in B78H1-A10 cells by 50% at 1:1,118 and 1:483 dilutions. human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) neutralized HSV-1 infection by 50% at a 1:556 dilution in B78 MAb CH42, CH43, and MAb CH43 were able to neutralize HSV-2 infection in B78H1-C10 cells. titers expressed endogenous simian nectin-1 (but not nectin-1) and nectin-1 (but not HVEM), and vero cells expressed endogenous simian HVEM. VEM from Vero cells (a simian cell line) was less effective in supporting HSV-2 infection. the 50% HSV-1 neutralizing titer for CH43 in vero cells was observed at a 1:205 dilution, lower than the 1:483 dilution observed in B78H1-A10 cells. ADCC is mediated by effector cells in response to virus-specific antibodies bound to viral antigens expressed on the surfaces of infected cells. classical ADCC is mediated by NK cells, but other cell types, including macrophages and neutrophils, can also mediate ADCC. se curve using various concentrations of CH42 and CH43 MAbs showed that CH42 induced maximum NK-92-CD16 cell-activating activity at lower concentrations of antibody than CH43. 43.9% and 33.9% of NK-92-CD16 cells expressed CD107a on their surfaces. the isotype control antibody A32 induced NK-92-CD16 cell activation in >5% of cells only when the amount of antibody was >50 g/ml. dilutions of MAb CH42, CH43, or isotype control A32 in 96-well plates. diluted antibodies were added to the gD-coated wells. 5 105 NK-92-CD16 cells/well were added and incubated for 5 h. animals receiving 30 g or more of CH42 or CH43 or 5 mg of human IVIG had 100% survival after HSV-1 inoculation. eight-week-old BALB/c mice (5 animals/group) were injected i.p. with MAb CH42, CH43, or isotype control (A32) or human IVIG. 2 days later, both eyes were infected with HSV-1 after corneal scarification. mice treated with MAb CH42, CH43, or isotype control (A32) were infected with HSV-1 by corneal scarification. the mice were treated and infected as described in the legend to Fig. 4. eye swabs were obtained for the first 3 days after infection. titers were measured in vero cells, and daily group mean titers were determined. each point represents the results for one mouse. mice not infected with HSV-1 (No inf) served as a negative control. the mice were euthanized, trigeminal ganglia were harvested, DNA was isolated, and HSV-1 DNA copies per microgram of DNA were determined. error bars indicate standard deviations. antibodies that neutralize virus infection and mediate ADCC of infected cells may result in better protection from infection. we found that two MAbs derived from B cells of recipients of the RV144 HIV vaccine bound to amino acids in HSV-1 gD critical for its interaction with HVEM. binding of gD to gD predicted to reduce or eliminate ability of gD to bind to nectin-1. binding of gD to gD might mimic binding of HVEM to gD. gD could partially block surface of gD and reduce HSV-1 infection. mediated ADCC within 2 to 3 h after infection in vitro. protection of mice was correlated with the ability of the MAbs to induce ADCC. studies of human corneal epithelial cells, conjunctival epithelial cells, and retinal pigment epithelial cells indicate that HVEM is important for HSV-1 infection of the mouse vaginal tract (20), brain (19), and eyes (17, 18) further studies showed that HVEM may induce corneal disease after HSV infection independently of its role in virus entry (47) PBMCs from HSV-seronegative RV144 vaccine recipients were stained with fluorescently labeled antibodies to identify memory B cells that reacted with a gD tetramer (biotin-KKKKKKYALADASLKMADPNRFRGKDLPVLDQLLE) MAbs were expressed in 293T and expressed in 293T. culture supernatant was used in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for screening. antibodies from the culture supernatants were isolated using protein A/G columns. gene synthesized (GenScript) and used to produce linear cassettes. NK-92-CD16 cells were grown in MEM alpha (Gibco) supplemented with 0.2 mM Myo-insitol Prep (Sigma-Aldrich), nonessential amino acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, penicillin-streptomycin, 0.0025 mM folic acid, 10% heat-inactivated FBS (HyClone), 10% heat-inactivated horse serum and 200 IU the infected cells were dissociated with TrypLE, (Gibco) and resuspended at 107 cells/ml. 5 105 cells (in 50 l) were added to each well of 96-well U bottom plates. each MAb dilution with HSV-1-infected or uninfected SK-N-SH cells was performed in triplicate. the frequency of CD16-GFP+ NK cells expressing CD107a was analyzed by flow cytometry. female 8-week-old BALB/c mice (5 per group) were injected i.p. with MAb CH42 or CH43 at 450, 150, 30, or 6 g/mouse. eye swabs were taken to monitor virus shedding on days 1, 2, and 3 postinfection. the swabs were stored in 0.5 ml of medium at 80\u00b0C. the severity of eye disease was scored from 0 to 4 based on prior criteria. eronegative RV144 vaccine recipients were stained with fluorescently labeled antibodies to identify memory B cells that reacted with a gD tetramer. memory B cells that bound the gD tetramer (1% of memory B cells) were sorted into 96-well plates. RNA in the wells was used for reverse transcription (RT)-PCR to amplify the V(D) regions of both heavy and light chains. NK-92-CD16 cells were grown in MEM alpha (Gibco) supplemented with 0.2 mM Myo-insitol Prep (Sigma-Aldrich), nonessential amino acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, penicillin-streptomycin, 0.0025 mM folic acid, 10% heat-inactivated FBS (HyClone), 10% heat-inactivated horse serum (Life Technologies) SK-N-SH cells were infected with HSV-1 McKrae at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 16 h. uninfected SK-N-SH cells included as a negative control. fected SK-N-SH cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 15 min. 1 105 NK-92-CD16 cells in 50 l were added to each well. cultures were stained with allophycocyanin (APC)-Cy7-conjugated anti-CD107a. the cells were stained with 4 g/ml anti-CD107a antibody in EDTA-PBS buffer for 30 min at room temperature. the frequency of CD16-GFP+ NK cells expressing CD107a was analyzed by flow cytometry. mice were injected i.p. with MAb CH42 or CH43 at 450, 150, 30, or 6 g/mouse. mice were euthanized, their trigeminal ganglia were harvested, and DNA was isolated with a QIAgen blood and tissue DNA kit. t test was performed to compare eye swabs and ocular disease scores."}
