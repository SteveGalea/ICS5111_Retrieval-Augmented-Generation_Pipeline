{"summary": "olfactory epithelium of the nose is stimulated by volatile substances. human sensory perception has become increasingly focused on visual and auditive impulses. olfactory system prevents us from consuming spoilt food, alerts us to the smell of burning. axons of bipolar receptor cells combine into 40 bundles called fila olfactoria. they project into the olfactory bulb via the lamina cribrosa. central activity after odor stimulation can be visualized by positron emission tomography. olfactory epithelium is often determined in dorsoposterior sections of the septum. abundancies in the area of superior turbinate [3], [4] and middle turbinate [5] show greater variability. olfactory performance decreases with age, possibly because of accelerated apoptosis. olfactory loss is associated with a markedly increased risk of exposure to hazardous events in every-day living. for many affected individuals, the main problem lies in the consumption of bland and tasteless food. patients with post-traumatic anosmia have also had an elevated gustatory threshold. a large number of validated test procedures are available. the \"Sniffin' Sticks\" test battery assesses odor discrimination, odor identification, and olfactory threshold. the \"sniffin' Sticks\" test battery is used to measure evoked potentials. olfactory disorders in 72% of all treated patients have a sinonasal origin. the incidence of olfactory disorders is estimated to be 1.4% [40], but more recent studies suggest that the actual figure is probably higher [41], [42]. olfactory disorders in 72% of all treated patients have a sinonasal origin. olfactory disorders include impairments caused by illnesses of the nose or the paranasal sinuses. olfactory dysfunction may be caused by damage to the olfactory mucosa. tos et al. and Lund et al. [56] reported significant improvement of subjective olfactory sensitivity in response to budesonide. but objective olfactory performance was not determined. budesonide spray failed to achieve significant improvement of olfaction assessed with three substances. oral steroids were used successfully in the fifties in patients with nasal obstruction, polyps, and olfactory disorders. the term'steroid-dependent anosmia' is used for cases who rapidly experience clear improvement of olfaction after oral steroids. olfactory performance often fluctuates as seen in medical histories. leukotriene synthesis inhibitors (Zileuton) and leukotriene antagonists (Montelukast, Zafirlukast) have been shown to alleviate the complaints in patients with polyps [73] but data on olfactory performance are either limited to single observations [73] or rare [74]. Delank and Stoll achieved normosmia in only 25% of hyposmic patients. 5% of patients with initial anosmia achieved improvements in olfactory function. authors failed to document any difference in olfactory performance one year after surgery. twenty years ago, Stevens and Stevens documented olfactory threshold improvements in 100 patients undergoing inferior turbinectomy. no conclusive data on the correlation between olfactory performance and nasal airflow are available. the decision to use septoplasty to improve olfactory performance remains controversial. initial histologic appearance of the olfactory epithelium may be quite normal [64], [96], while irreversible olfactory receptor damage, epithelial metaplasia, and fibrosis are commonly seen. olfactory disorders of non-sinonasal Etiology 4.2.1 Postviral olfactory disorders. olfactory impairment may be independent of nasal congestion. olfactory and respiratory epithelia alternate; number of olfactory receptor neurons reduced. the central nervous system (CNS) via the olfactory bulb did not occur and the animals survived. virus-induced apoptosis of olfactory cells via caspase-3 activation may be viewed as a mechanism to protect the organism from viral penetration into the CNS. 4.2.1.3 Treatment of postviral olfactory disorders. post-traumatic changes were characterized as encephalomalacias [122] and reduced volumes of the olfactory bulb [121], [123]. axons from olfactory receptor neurons eventually leads to retrograde cell death. a prospective study in 95 patients suffering from post-traumatic olfactory disorders reported significant improvement of self-assessed olfactory performance in 2 of 4 patients receiving zinc sulfate for > 1 month. the authors discussed a possible intrabulbous repair mechanism and a neuroprotective effect of the glutamate receptor inhibitor, caroverine. olfactory epithelium found in 36 biopsies of 7 patients with congenital anosmia [141]. leopold et al. described pathological epithelium with immature olfactory receptor neurons and missing cilia in 2 of 5 patients [142]. 4.2.3.2 Treatment of congenital olfactory disorders At present, no treatment options are known. reosis, renal failure, diabetes mellitus, and psychiatric diseases are accompanied by olfactory disorders. drugs themselves may induce olfactory disorders, but these tend to be transient and reversible in most cases [151], [151]. a longitudinal study in ovarectomized mice showed that they recovered more quickly if they received hormonal replacement than did those not receiving any hormones. auricular acupuncture improved olfactory threshold in 23 healthy volunteers. auricular acupuncture improved olfactory threshold in 23 healthy volunteers. auricular acupuncture improved olfactory threshold in 23 healthy volunteers. MRI in 3 patients indicated enhanced central activation after treatment. olfactory receptor neurons are continuously replaced during the course of life. the rate of neurogenesis is highest at younger age. olfactory disorders of sinonasal etiology are discussed as a group to facility overview. chronic rhinitis or rhinosinusitis often lead to deterioration of the olfactory threshold [47], [48], while neither the visibility of the olfactory cleft [49], [50] nor nasal breathing [51] correlate with olfactory function as such. oral steroids were used successfully in the fifties in patients with nasal obstruction, polyps, and olfactory disorders. the term'steroid-dependent anosmia' is used for cases who rapidly experience clear improvement of olfaction after oral steroids. oral steroids improved olfactory function in 12 patients with ethmoid sinus disease. biacabe et al. reported improved odor threshold in 50% of cases treated with oral steroids. no placebo-controlled, double-blind studies have been performed. no definitive data on the effects of leukotrienes or macrolides on olfactory performance are available. successful combination of surgery with subsequent oral steroid therapy encouraged Jafek and Hill to recommend pretreatment with oral steroids. however, even the use of oral steroids after surgery often only achieves hyposmia [79], [80] a significant improvement was demonstrated in 178 patients receiving topical steroids for one year after surgery. a significant improvement was demonstrated in 178 patients receiving topical steroids for one year after surgery. authors failed to document any difference in olfactory performance one year after surgery between patients pretreated with oral steroids for one week and those not receiving any steroid pretreatment. pathological findings confined to the olfactory cleft may be of benefit. no conclusive data on the correlation between olfactory performance and nasal airflow are available. inflammatory reaction (including epithelial thinning, loss of supporting cells, cilia, and dendrites) occur not only on the infected nasal side but are virtually mirrored with a slight delay on the other nasal side. caspase-3, usually present in cells as inactive procaspase-3, thought to play a key role. olfactory impairment may be independent of nasal congestion. it remains controversial whether extent of damage observed correlates with olfactory dysfunction. olfactory receptor neurons often have cytoplasmic inclusions. spontaneous recovery and regeneration are common in postviral olfactory disorders and may occur up to 2 years after viral exposure. 4.2.1.4 Treatment of Parosmia / Phantosmia. y receptor neurons whose axons extend to the olfactory bulb via the lamina cribrosa to form synapses. the bulb supplies the olfactory receptor neurons with trophic factors. if no contact is established and synapses fail to develop, olfactory receptor neurons will die within a few days. the authors recommended a double-blind study to confirm this notion. the use of local dexamethasone (4 mg/0.5 mL, 8 times, injected into the mucosa of the upper septum in 2-week intervals) in 6 patients, the recognition threshold was improved, while 4 patients experienced an improved identification threshold. the olfactory epithelium is located away from the main airway. 10% to 15% of the inhaled air reaches the olfactory epithelium even without sniffing. chronic exposure is more likely to induce lasting damage than acute exposure. only a small percentage of postmenopausal women with olfactory disorders receive hormonal therapy triggered speculation about a protective effect of hormones. a longitudinal study in 62 women failed to confirm these findings. auricular acupuncture improved olfactory threshold in 23 healthy volunteers. case report documented restored olfaction after acupuncture in a female patient who had been suffering from anosmia for 2 years. et al. reported a significant improvement of olfactory threshold for pyridine and taste threshold for bitter and salty substances in 37 patients with vitamin A deficiency. 106 patients participated in a double-blind study reported by Henkin et al. [171]. innervation takes place via the chorda tympani nerve, glossopharyngeal nerve, and vagus nerve. excitatory transmission for acidic and salty tastes occurs directly via ions. sweet and bitter tastes trigger secondary-messenger systems via membrane-specific receptors. 6.1 Classification and Epidemiology of Taste Disorders Taste disorders are classified as quantitative and qualitative taste disorders. quantitative disorders include hypogeusia and ageusia, while qualitative disorders are parageusia and phantogeusia. the classification as epithelial, neuronal, or central taste disturbance, depending on its cause, is in close agreement with the guidelines of the \"Arbeitsgemeinschaft Olfaktologie/Gustologie der Deutschen Gesellschaft f\u00fcr HNO Heilkunde, the taste disturbance can persist for 1 to 2 years after radiotherapy. the taste disturbance can persist for 1 to 2 years after radiotherapy. a randomized clinical study showed faster recovery of taste function. taste disturbances are often not the consequence of old age. they may be associated with concomitant diseases or side effects of drugs taken. a double-blind, placebo-controlled study failed to confirm this difference. dysgeusia is the most frequent form of taste disturbance and is often idiopathic. a link between dysgeusia and depression has been established. in two thirds of cases, dysgeusia resolves spontaneously after about 10 months. zinc sulfate (100 mg/day) increased salivary levels of carbonic anhydrase VI. reduced salivary volume can, but does not necessarily have to, lead to taste impairment [218]. artificial salivas, oral rinses and gels have been proposed to treat xerostomia. the taste disturbance can persist for 1 to 2 years after radiotherapy. a randomized clinical study showed faster recovery of taste function in patients receiving zinc sulfate (3 x 45 mg/day, given during radiotherapy and for 1 month afterwards) taste disturbances are often not the consequence of old age but may be associated with concomitant diseases or side effects of drugs taken [198] in elderly patients, taste disturbances are often not the consequence of old age but may be associated with concomitant diseases. the debate of its clinical relevance is controversial. dysgeusia is the most frequent form of taste disturbance and is often idiopathic. a link between dysgeusia and depression has been established. in two thirds of cases, dysgeusia resolves spontaneously after about 10 months. zinc sulfate (100 mg/day) increased salivary levels of carbonic anhydrase VI. reduced salivary volume can, but does not necessarily have to, lead to taste impairment. artificial salivas, oral rinses and gels have been proposed to treat xerostomia.
