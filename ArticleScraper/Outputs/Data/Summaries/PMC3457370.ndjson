CC50s were determined from the same wells that were later used to determine EC50s. i = A + D A 1 + ( C 1 I 1 C 2 I 2 C 3 I 3 B 4 I 4 B 5 I 5 concentration i ). response represents the normalized data. for each combination, six to eight replicate plates were analyzed per experiment. values of synergy or antagonism under 25 M2% at 95% confidence were considered insignificant. values over 100 indicated strong synergy, and values less than 100 indicated strong antagonism. in three-dimensional plots, an overall response below the 0% plane was considered to indicate antagonism. dA/dt is the flux of test compound across the monolayer (nmol/s) dA/dt is the surface area of the cell monolayer (nmol/s), and C0 is the initial concentration (M) in the donor compartment. reactions were quenched by the addition of two volumes of acetonitrile. 0.1 M sodium chloride, 4 mM potassium chloride, 1 mM magnesium sulfate, and 30 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) were used in dialysis membranes (HTDialysis, LLC, Gales Ferry, CT) with a 12,000- to 14,000 molecular mass cutoff. coagulated blood samples taken after dosing were centrifuged at 4\u00b0C (1,500 to 2,000 g); plasma samples were stored at 20\u00b0C until analyzed. the lower limit of quantification of ASV was 1 nM in plasma samples from all species, 5 nM in mouse and rat tissues and 50 nM in dog and monkey tissues. dogs (n = 3; overnight fast) were administered ASV by oral gavage at 3 or 6 mg/kg (3 mg/ml in 85% PEG-400\u201315% water) serial blood samples were collected from vascular access ports at 0.08, 0.167, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 24, 48, and 48 h postdose. ASV inhibited the NS3 proteolytic activity of genotype 1a (H77 strain) and genotype 1b (J4L6S strain), with IC50s of 0.7 and 0.3 nM, respectively. in vitro potencies of VX-950 ranged from 12 to 537 nM against enzymes representing genotypes 1 through 6. in order to determine the inhibition constant (Ki), apparent Km determinations for the FRET-labeled peptide substrate were calculated in the presence of increasing concentrations of ASV. the maximum enzyme turnover rate (Vmax) remained constant, typical of a first-order competitive inhibitor. the substrate specificity determinant of proteases is generally defined by the side chains flanking the cleavage site (35). the naturally occurring trans-cleavage substrates for HCV NS3/4A protease exhibit a strict requirement for a cysteine residue in the P1 position of the scissile bond. selectivity is an important feature for PIs designed as therapeutic agents. NS3/4A protease had a selectivity index of approximately 30,000 for the HCV NS3/4A protease representing the genotype 1a H77c strain. these indices compared favorably with those calculated for VX-950 against closely related human serine proteases and GBV-B versus its activity against the HCV genotype 1a NS3/4A protease. inhibition of HCV RNA replication by ASV was monitored using a luciferase reporter assay. however, comparable inhibitory effects could be determined by directly measuring HCV RNA or protein expression. replicons encoding the NS3 protease domains representing genotypes 1a, 1b, and 4a were also monitored. transient 1.8 0.2 1,137 223 a Genotypes 2b, 3a, and 4a are NS3 protease hybrid-derived replicons. c Data are means standard deviations from at least three independent experiments. six HCV antivirals, including rIFN-, ribavirin, daclatasvir (HCV NS5A replication complex inhibitor), an NS5B inhibitor targeting the nucleoside-binding site (NM-107) and site II (HCV-796) were tested in two-drug combinations with ASV. no antagonism was observed at any of the effective doses. ribavirin concentration-response curves resulted in EC50 and CC50s that were not well separated enough for analysis by the method of Chou (20 5 M and 68 23 M, respectively) combined response data were analyzed using the MacSynergy II software developed by Prichard and Shipman (University of Michigan) the permeability of ASV was examined using a PAMPA model and the cell-based Caco-2 bidirectional permeability assay. the Pc for the NS3 PI were >473 nm/sec (pH 5.5) and >492 nm/sec (pH 7.4). these values represent approximately 24, 43, 69, and 41% of hepatic blood flow in rats, dogs, monkeys, and humans. the predicted human CLh,int of ASV (41%) is more similar to that predicted for dogs (43%) than it is to that predicted for rats (24%) or monkeys (69%). plasma and liver concentrations, as well as that in other organs, were assessed in mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys. animals were dosed orally (PO) with ASV, and drug exposure was monitored over 24 h. liver contained the highest concentrations of ASV, with the elevated liver-to-plasma area under the curve (AUC) ratios. the observed liver-to-plasma ratio after oral dosing to monkeys (150) was in between the ratios observed in mice (>80) or rats (360) and higher than that for dogs (40). when dose prediction analyses were considered, it was assumed the high liver levels observed across preclinical species would also translate to humans. c Fold EC50 multiples of ASV were calculated by dividing the C24 value by the EC50 for ASV in HCV genotype 1a replicons (EC50 4 nM) values in parentheses represent a similar calculation using the ASV EC50 in 40% human serum (EC50 26 nM). b VX-950 was preincubated with each of the respective NS3/4A protease complexes for 30 min before the addition of substrate to obtain optimum potency. the mechanism of inhibition was established for ASV using purified recombinant full-length HCV NS3/4A protease complexes. values for aSV were approximately 0.4 nM and 0.2 nM for the HCV NS3/4A protease complexes representing genotype 1a and genotype 1b respectively. the acylsulfonamide moiety of telaprevir covalently binds to the catalytic serine of NS3/4A protease. steine proteases included human leukocyte elastase, porcine pancreatic elastase, and three members of the chymotrypsin family of serine proteases. GBV-B belongs to the family Flaviviridae and is closely related to human HCV. the catalytic triad and the S1 specificity determinant residue, a phenylalanine at residue 154 are conserved. chymotrypsin >50 45 8 Human cathepsin A >5b 0.33 0.02 Human cathepsin B >50 1.7 0.2 Trypsin >30 ND Factor VIIa >30 ND Factor VIIa >30 ND Factor XIa >30 ND Kallikrein >30 ND, not determined. b Assay interference was observed at 20 M. activity of ASV against HCV RNA replication was measured using replicons cell culture potency of ASV and VX-950 in HCV replicons Genotype (strain)a Stable cell line or transient-transfection replicon assayb EC50 (nM)c ASV VX-950 1a (H77c) Stable cell line 4.0 0.3 995 11 1b (Con1) Stable cell line 1.2 0.3 427 3 2a (JFH-1) Stable cell line 230 74 229 32 3a ( a Virus Cell type EC50 (M) CC50 (M)a HCV-1ab HuH-7 0.004 0.0003 25 5 BVDVc HuH-7 12 2 32 4 HCoVOC43 MRC5 >32 32 5 HIV MT-2 13 2 34 3 NA HepG2 NA 38 5 NA HEK293 NA 11 2 a Data are means standard deviation from at least three independent experiments. rIFN- and daclatasvir (synergistic-additive) and NS5B inhibitors (additive or synergistic-additive) were also observed in two-drug combination studies. no antagonism was observed in any of the combinations evaluated. overall result 50% effective 75% effective 90% effective 1 1.7 12.8 25:1 0.97 (0.89, 1.06) 0.94 (0.83, 1.05) 0.90 (0.74, 1.07) Additivity 10:1 0.77 (0.70, 0.84) 0.81 0.71, 0.91) 0.86 (0.70, 1.03) Synergy/additivity 4 1.5 24.5 25:1 0.71 (0.66, 0.77) 0.61 (0.54, 0.67) 0.52 (0.43, 0.6 the predicted hepatic intrinsic clearance (CLh,int) values represent approximately 24, 43, 69, and 41% of hepatic blood flow in rats, dogs, monkeys, and humans. these values represent approximately 24, 43, 69, and 41% of hepatic blood flow in rats, dogs, monkeys, and humans. protein binding of the compound (0.5, 3, and 10 M) was determined in the replicon assay medium (containing 4% FBS) and found to be 77.6% 1.5%, 76.0% 4.8%, and 68.1% 1.1%, respectively. supplementation of 40% human serum to an HCV genotype 1b replicon assay resulted in a loss in ASV potency of approximately 6.5-fold. liver tissue and plasma concentrations of ASV were determined through 72 h after PO dosing. other tissues (spleen) contained lower levels of ASV than liver. liver tissue again contained the highest concentration of compound, while spleen contained considerably less. c Fold EC50 multiples of ASV were calculated by dividing the C24 value by the EC50 for ASV in 40% human serum (EC50 26 nM). DISCUSSION ASV is a linear peptide mimetic HCV NS3 PI discovered using a structure-based drug design approach. it is most active against proteases representing genotype 1, the genotype responsible for the highest unmet medical need. isolates representing genotypes 2 and 3 are the least susceptible to inhibition. reduced activity against genotype 3 was anticipated, since the reported salt bridge that forms between the charged NS3 amino acid residues R155 and D168 would not form. replacement of the charged D168 by neutral residues, predicted to weaken or destroy the 155:168 salt bridge. telaprevir and boceprevir are administered three times daily at high doses. danoprevir appears likely to require boosting with ritonavir to achieve twice-daily administration. but single- and multiple-ascending-dose monotherapy clinical studies with ASV indicated rapid robust responses at lower doses than reported for telaprevir, boceprevir, or danoprevir (37). cathepsin A is believed to be involved in the initial activation of the prodrug moiety of the NS5B polymerase nucleotide PSI-7977 via cleavage of the amino acid ester moiety (34). these results suggest that the selectivity profile of ASV has the potential to result in improved tolerability over telaprevir in vivo. resistance to direct-acting NS3 PIs has been shown to emerge rapidly during monotherapy (44) combination therapies can achieve improved sustained viral responses (22, 39) for an investigational agent to be combined with another HCV agent in patients, it is important to first demonstrate that no antagonism is observed. ASV into the hepatocyte and elimination via the bile across species suggests that the compound was enriched in hepatocytes. this is considered a desirable property given that HCV is a disease of the liver, with viral replication occurring in hepatocytes. a limited systemic exposure of the compound would reduce the potential for nonspecific side effects. all patients were infected with genotype 1a and the emergent NS3 protease-resistant variants detected were similar to those obtained in vitro. all patients receiving ASV and daclatasvir for 24 weeks achieved SVR, suggesting that genotype 1 subtype can strongly influence virologic outcome (8)."}
