{"summary": "a total of 19 patients with juvenile RA (8 males, 11 females; mean age 8.71 3.26 years), and 22 healthy age- and sex-matched volunteers served as controls. all patients were clinically assessed according to detailed diagnostic information obtained from the medical records and physical examinations. DCs were induced to mature by lipopolysaccharide (100 ng/ml; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) concentration of extracellular ATP was detected using ENLITEN\u00ae rLuciferase/Luciferin Reagent. each sample was centrifuged at 600 g for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C. the reaction was performed according to a modified protocol on the 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) the -actin was adopted as an endogenous reference, and the 2ct method was used to calculate the relative expression level of interested genes in each group. induction of CIA CIA was induced in 6- to 8-week-old male DBA/1J mice as previously described29,30. mice were immunized intradermally at the tail base with bovine CII (100 l of 1 mg/ml) emulsified in complete Freund\u2019s adjuvant. phorbol myristate acetate (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) and 1 M ionomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) were stained with anti-CD4-FITC (eBioscience, SanDiego, CA, USA) for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. cells were stained with anti-IL-17A-APC (eBioscience, SanDiego, CA, USA) for 30 min. a value of P 0.05 was considered statistically significant. 19 patients with juvenile RA (8 males, 11 females; mean age 8.71 3.26 years), and 22 healthy age- and sex-matched volunteers served as controls. DCs were induced to mature by lipopolysaccharide (100 ng/ml; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) concentration of extracellular ATP was detected using ENLITEN\u00ae rLuciferase/Luciferin Reagent (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) the reaction was performed according to a modified protocol on the 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System. the -actin was adopted as an endogenous reference. the 2ct method was used to calculate the relative expression level of interested genes in each group. induction of CIA CIA was induced in 6- to 8-week-old male DBA/1J mice. mice were immunized intradermally with bovine CII (100 l of 1 mg/ml) emulsified. 31 cells were incubated with 50 ng/ml phorbol myristate acetate and 1 M ionomycin. cells were stained with anti-CD4-FITC for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. cells were stained with anti-IL-17A-APC (eBioscience, SanDiego, CA, USA) for 30 min. the expression of P2X7R on PBMCs was measured by quantitative real-time PCR. the expression of P2X7R on PBMCs was measured by quantitative real-time PCR. continuous treatment increased ATP levels up to 6 folds. CII failed to elevate the level of P2X7R, ruling out the possible involvement of endogenous ATP. CII-induced ATP release from DCs requires presence of P2X7R function. Suramin completely blocked the CII-stimulated ATP secretion at the doses of 30 and 100 M. only A-438079 at 300 nM could completely block the CII-stimulated ATP secretion. mRNA levels of IL-1, TGF-1, IL-23p19, IL-12p40, IL-12p35 and IL-6 in CII-stimulated DCs. mRNA levels of IL-1, TGF-1, IL-23p19, IL-12p40, IL-12p35 and IL-6 in CII-stimulated DCs. CII-stimulated coculture supernatant showed a marked alteration compared with controls. we found strong production of the IL-1, TGF-1, IL-23p19, IL-12p40, IL-12p35 and IL-6. preconditioning with P2X7R antagonists only eliminated release-promoting effects of CII on above Th17-promoting cytokines. CD4+ IL-17A+ cells were significantly increased in response to CII. prior exposure to P2X7R antagonists had no effect on the CD4+ IL-17A+ cell populations in CII-stimulated subjects as compared with unstimulated controls. IL-17 elevation was not caused by the direct effect of ATP on T cells. mRNA and protein levels of IL-17A in response to 3 mM ATP. blocking the P2X7R signaling attenuated CII-mediated joint damage of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice compared with the control subjects, there was a higher level of IL-17A in synovial tissues in CII-treated mice. the expression of P2X7R on PBMCs was measured by quantitative real-time PCR. each data-point represents the result for one normal individual or RA patient. CII-induced ATP release from DCs requires presence of P2X7R function. in early stages of culture, cell viability was unaffected by CII treatment. 30 M Suramin and 300 nM A-438079 were administered in the following experiments to ensure a better competitiveness. results show that P2X7R is involved in CII-induced ATP release from DC/CD4+ T cell coculture system. X7R antagonists caused strong inhibition of production of Th17-promoting cytokines. but not of Th1-promoting cytokines in CII-treated DCs. mRNA levels of IL-1, TGF-1, IL-23p19, IL-12p35 and IL-6 in CII-stimulated DCs. preconditioning with P2X7R antagonists only eliminated release-promoting effects of CII on the above Th17-promoting cytokines. however, the addition of CII could stimulate the production of Th17-promoting cytokines. CII treatment resulted in a substantial up-regulation of mRNAs encoding RORt and RORt. t, ROR and IL-17A; (B) Supernatant level; (C) Percentage of CD4+ IL-17A+ cells. data are expressed as mean SE. n = 8 for each group. IL-17A elevation was not caused by the direct effect of ATP on T cells. CII-treated mice showed a higher level of IL-17A in synovial tissues. significant increases in paw oedema were recorded in CIA mice. treatment with P2X7R antagonists was effective in suppressing arthritis. blocking the P2X7R signaling attenuated CII-mediated joint damage of CIA mice. expression of extracellular ATP was higher in monocytes from patients with RA compared with controls37. also increased P2X7R expression in the RA patients as compared to their normal counterparts. CIA resembles many pathological features of RA, including synovial hyperplasia. CII dose-dependently increased the concentrations of extracellular ATP and prolonged culture with CII resulted in a further elevation of extracellular ATP. inflammasome/IL-1 dependent and independent pathways maybe two downstream cellular signaling mechanisms proposed for P2X7R stimulation46,47. a previous study showed that stimulation of P2X7R by CII failed to induce the upregulation of Th17-promoting cytokines in DCs. a previous study showed that stimulation of P2X7R by BzATP caused no influence on the release of L-12p7053. however, absence of the P2X7R did not affect IL-1 production54. blocking the P2X7R signaling had a similar influence on the cytokine profile in the CII-stimulated coculture supernatant. a previous study showed that ATP stimulation strongly induced P2X7R expression both at the transcriptional and translational levels57. meanwhile intensified stimulation of ATP enhance the expression of P2X7R. further studies are needed to elucidate signalling pathways for the release of inflammatory cytokines induced by CII. we then investigated its influence on the expressions of RORt and ROR, essential for Th17 cell differentiation. blockade of P2X7R remarkably inhibited hind paw swelling and ameliorated the pathological changes in ankle joint of the CIA mice. GM-CSF can act as an anti-inflammatory/regulatory cytokine in many situations. GM-CSF treatment leaded to a sustained increase in the Foxp3 expression and an enhance capability of Foxp3+CD4+CD25+ Tregs to limit the proliferative capacities of CD4+ T effector cells. GM-CSF presented positive effect on the differentiation of Th17 cells through its pro-inflammatory role and P2X7R inhibition attenuated joint damage of CIA mice. X7R antagonists are available that could be helpful for drug screening and in managing patients with RA."}
