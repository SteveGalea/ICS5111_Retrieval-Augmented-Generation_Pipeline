{"summary": "infection is more likely to be transmitted between genetically similar hosts. parasites would likely die, fail to reproduce or otherwise be removed from the population. there may not seem to be an escape from disease, but genetic diversity in host populations may reduce the risk of infection. genetic bottlenecks have reduced genetic variability in cheetahs. endangered black-footed ferret may have been extirpated from its natural habitat. newly-colonised, western populations of Italian agile frogs are genetically depauperate. heavily inbred California sea lions were more infected, and consequently, may act as pathogen reservoirs, spreading parasites in sea lion populations. increased susceptibility resulted from a lower frequency of resistance alleles in the population, and not by generalized inbreeding effects. Founder populations provide the opportunity to examine the effects of inbreeding and small population size on the link between genetic diversity and parasite resistance. self-fertilizing populations and inbred sexual populations were found to have higher infection rates by a trematode parasite compared with outbred sexual populations of topminnows. in another species of partially-selfing fish, Ellison et al. (2011) found that outcrossing increased the genetic diversity of wild populations and decreased their susceptibility to multiple parasites. studies in which the number of founding queens was experimentally manipulated have confirmed that colonies founded by multiple queens have lower parasite loads. increased infection prevalence in the wild is associated with genetic bottlenecking and inbreeding, induced by founder effects. diversity on resistance in host populations compared with 'polycultures' of several genotypes with higher allelic diversity. if the parasite population is genetically homogenous, increases in host population genetic diversity might boost the opportunity for parasites to encounter a susceptible host. host genetic diversity could reduce the risk of disease spread. the matching-alleles model is a useful framework for studying self/non-self-recognition systems in animals. the model assumes that there are no co-infections. matching host genotype, and B is equal to the total number of parasite propagules produced by each infection that make contact with a host. increasing the number of host genotypes decreases the frequency (gi) of each genotype. doubling the number of host genotypes in the population would reduce R0 by one half. an uninfected host population was initiated at carrying capacity (K=40 000) the number of hosts of each genotype was determined by randomly assigning allele frequencies at the two loci. at generation 1, one host of each genotype was introduced as infected. each infection produced nine propagules that contacted a host. introducing a single novel allele in the host population increased the number of possible genotypes by 50%. this led to virtual elimination of the parasite, as the prevalence of infection plummeted from about 60% to near zero. we then introduced a third allele at the second locus at generation 100, which increased the number of possible genotypes from six to nine. a reduction in prevalence occurred despite the fact that matching parasite genotypes were also introduced into the population. the model suggests that increasing population size on R0 shows diminishing returns with host density, such that R0 is asymptotic on B/G. this suggests that increasing genetic diversity can still reduce parasite prevalence, even though host population size is also increased. the threshold was calculated by assuming an infinite host population size. it works by reducing the probability of successful infection by reducing the frequency of matching host genotypes for each parasite genotype. the existing literature suggests that high genetic diversity could buffer host populations against disease spread."}
