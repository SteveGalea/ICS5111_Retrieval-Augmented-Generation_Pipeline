{"summary": "46 Hereford heifers, serologically negative for BVDV, were procured and transported to the foothills Campus, Fort Collins. the heifers were hormonally synchronized and artificially inseminated as per a previously established protocol. the remaining 23 heifers received a sham challenge of tissue culture medium only and were kept in a separate paddock at a distance from the infected heifers. foetal blood was collected prior to severing the umbilical cord. the foetal brains were submerged in 10% neutral-buffered formaldehyde. samples of all other organs were similarly fixed in 10% formaldehyde. the late gestation brains (the last two sampling points) were fixed in formaldehyde for an additional 48 h following trimming before processing to ensure uniform fixation. a section from each tissue block was stained with haematoxylin and eosin (HE), and selected samples were also stained with luxol fast blue/periodic acid Schiff (LFB\u2013PAS) the data are presented as mean SD and analyzed using Student's t-test for each time point PID. differences at p 0.05 were considered significant. experimental outline A total of 46 Hereford heifers were procured and transported to Colorado State University facilities at the Foothills Campus, Fort Collins. the heifers were hormonally synchronized and subsequently artificially inseminated as per a previously established protocol. foetal blood was collected by venepuncture of the cord. the foetal brains were submerged in 10% neutral-buffered formaldehyde. samples of all other organs were similarly fixed in 10% formaldehyde. de-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA was used as endogenous control for data normalization. transverse sections made for routine processing through to paraffin embedding. the late gestation brains (the last two sampling points) were fixed in formaldehyde for an additional 48 h following trimming before processing to ensure uniform fixation. drocytes were quantified by counting OLIG2-positive cells in 10 non-overlapping fields of the interphase between the sub-ventricular and intermediate zone. the data are presented as mean SD and analyzed using a 40 objective. bovine viral diarrhoea virus RNA was first detected at low levels in foetal blood of one foetus 14 days PID. however, by 21 days PID, all foetuses had high levels of viral RNA in the blood. all four foetuses of BVDV-challenged dams had detectable BVDV replication in the brain. one of the day 14 PID foetuses still negative for viral antigen in brain also lacked Iba1-positive cells in the PVGZ. there appeared to be a notable decrease in this cell type in the infected foetuses. this cell loss appeared to be preceded by or simultaneous with a mild increase in cells positive for activated caspase 3 in the PVGZ. challenge of the dams on day 75 of gestation Gestational age Days PID Challenge BVDV RNA* ISG15 mRNA Day 82 (11.7 w) 7 control (4/4) +(4/4) BVDV (4/4) +(4/4) Day 89 (12.7 w) 14 control (4/4) +(4/4) BVDV +(1/1) +++++(1/1) Day 97 (14 w) 21 control (4/4) +(4/4) BVDV + only amoeboid glial cells in the periventricular germinal zone are positive for bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) antigen at day 14 PID (day 89 of gestation; red-staining cells; examples indicated with arrows) large numbers of virus-infected amoeboid glial cells have arrived in the PVGZ. oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OLIG2 positive; brown nuclei) occur in decreased numbers in the peri- and subventricular germinal zone of a BVDV-infected foetus on day 89 of gestation. the results point to a neuro-invasive mechanism involving productively infected, migratory cells entering the developing brain with subsequent spread of the virus. the changes were most prominent in the dorsal part of the PVGZ. the endothelial cells of affected capillaries were negative for BVDV antigen. but the vessels were clearly associated with accumulations of BVDV-positive amoeboid microglial cells in the surrounding parenchyma. amoeboid glial cells and few other cell types in the periventricular germinal zone of a BVDV-infected foetus 14 days PID. microthrombi were also present in the choroid plexus of a BVDV-infected foetus 21 days PID. microcysts in the peri- and subventricular zones of bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV)-infected foetuses 170 days postinfection of the dam. despite the presence of virus-infected cells in the cerebellum, neither gross nor histological changes were seen in this part of the brain. ISG15 expression was detected in the brain of infected foetuses from BVDV-challenged dams as early as 14 days PID. vascular endothelial cells, including those of the PVGZ microvasculature, appeared to be the main interferon responders. a BVDV-infected foetus was up-regulated in the brain of foetuses from day 14 PID. in contrast to the intense interferon response, there appeared to be minimal or no detectable up-regulation of phospho-p38-MAPK in the infected PVGZ. by day 21 PID, the expression of NOS2 had comparatively diminished and was undetectable at the later time points. the BVDV non-structural protein p125/NS-2-3 was first detected in amoeboid macrophage-like cells, positive for Iba1 in the periventricular germinal zone (PVGZ) at the day 21 PID time point (day 97 of gestation) all four foetuses of BVDV-challenged dams had detectable BVDV replication in the brain, restricted to amoeboid cells and few other precursor cell cell loss appeared to be preceded by or simultaneous with a mild increase in cells positive for activated caspase 3 in the PVGZ. in no instance was viral RNA or antigen detected in blood or tissues of the foetuses derived from sham-infected dams. blood was successfully obtained from the umbilical cord of only one foetus. one of three foetuses was virus-RNA negative in RT-PCR on cord blood. the amoeboid glial cells stain positive for Iba-1 (black label; methyl green counterstain) clusters of amoeboid cells positive for BVDV antigen were present in the rhombic lip of the metencephalon. haematoxylin and eosin (HE) (a) and immunohistochemistry (b, c, inserts). the results point to a neuro-invasive mechanism involving productively infected, migratory cells entering the developing brain with subsequent spread of the virus to other cell types and possibly collateral adverse effects on oligodendrocyte precursors. of the four foetuses sampled at 21 days PID, one had similar vascular changes as well as microthrombi in the choroid plexus. in the other three foetuses, the affected PVGZ vessels appeared to have been lost and rarefaction or microcavities were noted in their place. microthrombi were also present in the choroid plexus of a BVDV-infected foetus 21 days PID. the cysts contain floccular material and few cells, which (d) are positive for BVDV antigen and Iba1. microcyst (MC) in the subventricular zone apparently lacking a continuous cellular lining, in contrast to the adjacent blood vessel (BV) and the lateral ventricle (LV) microcysts are surrounded by a layer of condensed astrocytic dendrites (brown mesh work) the microcysts are surrounded by a layer of condensed astrocytic dendrites (brown mesh work) intense ISG15 expression was detected in the brain of foetuses from BVDV-challenged dams as early as 14 days PID. notably, ISG15 protein expression was also detected in the two foetuses negative for BVDV antigen at that time point. all control foetuses were negative for ISG15 expression. there appeared to be minimal or no detectable up-regulation of phospho-p38-MAPK in the infected PVGZ or in cells in and around the hypertrophic microvessels or the microcavitations. however, NOS2 (iNOS) was up-regulated in the brain of foetuses from day 14 PID, mostnotably in the two foetuses with detectable neuro-infection. by day 21 PID, the expression of NOS2 had of ISG15 occurs at the time and even prior to detectable neuro-invasion by virus. the early interferon was of maternal origin, as initially vascular endothelial cells appeared to be the main interferon responders. there appears to be a substantial loss of oligodendrocyte precursors early in the infection, apparently from causes other than direct virus infection. the 'Trojan Horse' strategy appears to be used in the case of BVDV neuro-invasion following maternal infection at the very end of the first trimester (11- to 12-week gestation) no Iba1-positive amoeboid glial cells were detected in the two foetuses from this time point, while BVDV antigen and Iba1-positive cells coincided in the other two foetuses from this time point. the answer to this question may lie in the newly identified, ontogenically distinct derivation of microglia from the myeloid lineage. the answer is most likely abortive, because virus antigen appears to be restricted to the Golgi region in the vast majority of infected neurons at 115 days PID. many oligodendrocytes were lost, most likely at the precursor stage, even though few appeared to be infected. it is known from other infection models that oligodendrocytes and their precursors are exquisitely sensitive to many factors elaborated by activated microglial cells and astrocytes. despite early and relatively widespread virus infection in the germinal layer of the developing cerebellum, neither gross nor histological lesions were noted in this part of the brain. it remains an unresolved question whether BVDV-induced cerebellar hypoplasia is a consequence of (i) infection with certain BVDV strains, (ii) a very time-dependent event not pin-pointed, (iii) a breed-dependent factor, (iv) environmental co angiogenesis and vasculogenesis are generally thought to be regulated by HIF-1 and the downstream production of VEGF. however, HIF-1-independent pathways may occur under some circumstances such as the TRIF/TBK/IRF3 pathway. authors contributed substantially to (i) study design, data acquisition and/or data analysis and (ii) drafting and/or revision of manuscript, and all authors have approved the final, submitted version."}
