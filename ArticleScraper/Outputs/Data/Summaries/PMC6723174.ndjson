{"summary": "porcine coVs found in 77% of diarrheic samples and only in 7% of healthy samples. virulent strains related to those circulating in china were detected in the 1980s. virulent strains related to those circulating in china were detected in the united states. PEDV mainly infects small intestinal villous enterocytes, causing acute necrosis that leads to villi atrophy. this could produce severe diarrhea as a consequence of malabsorption. clinical signs are milder and self-limiting within five to 10 days after the onset of disease. re-infections have been reported in farms using the feed-back approach. current live attenuated vaccines did not prevent virus shedding. novel effective and safe vaccines against PEDV are required. chimeric recombinant TGEV virus expressing ectodomain of a virulent US PEDV S protein. chimeric virus was viable and initially virulent in piglets. attenuated vaccine candidate conferred partial protection to pigs from a challenge with a virulent PEDV. a recombinant virulent US PEDV virus (rPEDV) was recovered from an infectious cDNA engineered by our group. PEDV viruses and recombinant TGEV viruses obtained in this work were grown in vero cells. TGEV sequence encoding S protein transmembrane domain and endodomain was amplified using pGEM-T-TGEV-SC11 plasmid. plasmid was digested with PacI and MluI restriction enzymes. fragment containing chimeric S gene was cloned into the same sites of pBAC-TGEV-SC11-P-M or pBAC-TGEV-SC11-RS. cDNA Clones BHK-pAPN cells grown to 90% confluence in 35 mm plates were transfected using 4 g of the corresponding pBAC and 12 L of Lipofectamine 2000. at 6 h post-transfection (hpt), BHK-pAPN transfected cells were trypsinized, washed twice with DMEM, and plated over confluent Vero monolayers grown in 35-mm-diameter plates. jejunum sections were washed twice with PBS and stored in 70% ethanol at 4 \u00b0C. samples were examined with a ZEISS Axiophot fluorescence microscope. determination of the damage was obtained from unbiased measurement of three full-length perceived villi and crypt per location. three animals per group were euthanized and necropsied at days 4 and 10 post-immunization. samples were kept frozen for subsequent virus titration. samples were stabilized with RNAlater stabilization reagent. ase-conjugated protein A, goat anti pig IgG (Fc domain) or goat anti pig IgA (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) diluted 1:10,000 in PBS with 0.1% BSA. ELISA was developed with K-Blue TMB substrate (Neogen, Lexington, KY, USA) total cDNA was synthesized using 100 ng of total RNA as a template. the viral genome region from 3b gene to 3\u2032 UTR (nt. 25856\u201328544) was sequenced in all cases. overlapping PCRs were performed using oligo pairs described in Table 2. the porcine -glucuronidase (GUSB) gene (TaqMan code Ss03387751_u1) was used as a reference housekeeping gene. its expression remains constant in infected cells compared to that in non-infected cells [53] and data not shown. all experiments and data analysis were MIQE compliant [55]. a recombinant virulent US PEDV virus (rPEDV) was recovered from an infectious cDNA. PEDV viruses and recombinant TGEV viruses obtained in this work were grown in vero cells supplemented with infection medium. the obtained 4073 bp and 308 bp PCR products were used as templates and amplified with oligonucleotides Pac-S-VS and TGEV-S-4439-RS. the plasmid was digested with PacI and MluI restriction enzymes and cloned into the same sites of pBAC-TGEV-SC11-P-M or pBAC-TGEV-SC11-RS. rTGEVs from cDNA Clones were transfected using 4 g of the corresponding pBAC and 12 L of Lipofectamine 2000. at 6 h post-transfection, BHK-pAPN transfected cells were trypsinized, washed twice with DMEM, and plated over confluent Vero monolayers grown in 35-mm-diameter plates. one hour later, trypsin was added to a final concentration of jejunum sections were washed twice with PBS and stored in 70% ethanol at 4 \u00b0C. paraffin embedding, sectioning, and hematoxylin-eosin staining were performed by the histological laboratory (Autopsy Path Kft., Budapest, Hungary) three animals per group were euthanized and necropsied at days 4 and 10 post-immunization. samples were kept frozen for subsequent virus titration. samples were stabilized with RNAlater stabilization reagent. antibodies were detected by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated protein A, goat anti pig IgG (Fc domain) or goat anti pig IgA (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) diluted 1:10,000 in PBS with 0.1% BSA. ELISA was developed with K-Blue TMB substrate (Neogen, Lexington, KY, USA) for 5 min at room temperature. total cDNA was synthesized using 100 ng of total RNA as a template. the viral genome region from 3b gene to 3\u2032 UTR (nt. 25856\u201328544) was sequenced in all cases. overlapping PCRs were performed using specific oligo pairs. TGEV gRNA was evaluated using a custom TaqMan assay set up in our laboratory [52]. the porcine -glucuronidase gene (GUSB) was used as a reference housekeeping gene. its expression remains constant in infected cells compared to that in non-infected cells. chimeric SPEDV-TGEV protein was cloned in an infectious cDNA from an attenuated TGEV. rTGEV-SPEDV and rTGEV-RS-SPEDV were recovered after transfection of vero cells with wild-type and attenuated cDNAs. rTGEV-RS-SPEDV virus peak titers were five- to 10-fold lower than those for parental rTGEV-SPEDV virus rTGEV virus expressing the chimeric S protein from an attenuated background containing transcription regulating sequences (TRSs) duplication and introduction of restriction sites are in italics, duplicated sequences into grey boxes. each gene is in a color box as in the upper virus genome scheme. rTGEV-SPEDV titers were slightly lower than those for rTGEV-RS-SPEDV virus. at 6 dpi, rTGEV-SPEDV titers were slightly lower than those for rTGEV-RS-SPEDV virus. piglets infected with rTGEV-RS-SPEDV virus lost weight after infection. the jejunum damage was significantly lower in animals infected with the attenuated rTGEV-RS-SPEDV virus. the data indicate that rTGEV-RS-SPEDV virus was partially attenuated. pictures were obtained with a 2.5 objective. rTGEV-SPEDV virus was sequenced using RNA isolated from five-day-old piglets at six days post-infection. modifications were only detected in the engineered TRS duplicated sequences. rTGEV-RS-SPEDV virus was genetically stable in cell culture. five-day-old piglets were orally inoculated with 106 TCID50/piglet. RNA from these samples was extracted, virus was detected by RT-PCR. modifications introduced in the recombinant virus used to inoculate the piglets were represented as in Figure 1C. the animal age, no clinical sings of enteric disease were observed after vaccination or challenge. however, animals vaccinated with the virulent PEDV-NVSL strain showed a delay in weight gain the first week after vaccination. similar observations were reported for other virulent US isolates. similar results were obtained when viral RNA presence was evaluated. after challenge, PEDV virus was only shed by non-vaccinated animals. rTGEV-RS-SPEDV titers in the enteric tract of animals vaccinated with virulent PEDV. total antibodies increased in all vaccinated pigs at 28 and 31 dpv. the increase was slower in the vaccinated pigs, in agreement with a decreased challenge virus replication in these animals. pigs vaccinated with both PEDV-NVSL and rTGEV-RS-SPEDV virus induced a significant level of neutralizing antibodies before challenge. the values represent neutralization index from three different animals. rTGEV-RS-SPEDV virus conferred protection against PEDV infection. the chimeric protein was cloned in the TGEV infectious cDNA [30], replacing TGEV S protein (rTGEV-SPEDV, Figure 1B) the chimeric protein was cloned in an infectious cDNA from an attenuated TGEV. rTGEV-SPEDV and rTGEV-RS-SPEDV were recovered after transfection of vero cells. n, domains recognized by neutralizing antibodies; HR, heptad repeat domain; TM, transmembrane domain. scheme of rTGEV virus encoding a chimeric S protein (SPEDV-TGEV) labels above the boxes indicate viral genes. five-day-old piglets were orally inoculated with 106 TCID50/piglet. viral titers in the jejunum of infected piglets were similar for both viruses. at 6 dpi, rTGEV-SPEDV titers were slightly lower than those for rTGEV-RS-SPEDV virus. values represent the standard deviation for each value; p values, * 0.05, ** 0.01, *** 0.001. epithelial degeneration and exfoliation in the different parts of the jejunum was observed in animals infected with rTGEV-RS-SPEDV virus. the rTGEV-RS-SPEDV virus genetic stability was evaluated in cell culture. no changes appeared in the passed virus compared with the parental one. rTGEV-RS-SPEDV virus was genetically stable in cell culture. in vivo evolved rTGEV-RS-SPEDV virus may still be attenuated. piglets were orally inoculated with 106 TCID50/piglet. RNA from these samples was extracted, virus was detected by RT-PCR. animals from two groups were vaccinated with a virulent recombinant PEDV strain (rPEDV-NVSL), and two groups of animals (G3 and G4) were not vaccinated. as expected, due to the animal age, no clinical sings of enteric disease were observed after vaccination or challenge. however, animals vaccinated with the virulent PEDV-NVSL strain showed a delay in weight gain the first week after vaccination, compared with non-inf the challenge virus replicated efficiently in the gut of non-vaccinated animals. the titers were reduced more than 25-fold or 50-fold in animals vaccinated with rTGEV-RS-SPEDV and PEDV-NVSL viruses. d PEDV-specific antibodies to a higher level in PEDV-NVSL vaccinated animals than in rTGEV-RS-SPEDV vaccinated ones. the chimeric rTGEV-RS-SPEDV virus only expressed PEDV S protein. all animals were seronegative at the time of vaccination. rTGEV-RS-SPEDV virus conferred protection against PEDV infection in the young pig model and could be the basis for an effective vaccine candidate. rTGEV-RS-SPEDV virus conferred protection against PEDV infection. the rTGEV-RS-SPEDV virus elicited a neutralizing humoral response specific for PEDV. vaccinated animals were protected against challenge with a virulent PEDV virus. the attenuated live vaccine candidates are the best option for PEDV vaccination. traditionally attenuated vaccines have reduced replication in the enteric tract. a swine enteric coronavirus (SeCoV) that is a recombinant between TGEV and PEDV has been described in Europe. rTGEV-RS-SPEDV virus used as a vaccine candidate was attenuated. biosafety could be improved by adding an additional safety guard at the 5\u2032-end of PEDV virus genome (in the replicase gene) the optimized candidate should keep a balance between virus replication attenuation and eliciting an efficient immune response."}
