{"summary": "vast amount of valuable information about infectious diseases is found in web-accessible information sources such as discussion forums, mailing lists, government Web sites, and news outlets. this potential is already being realized, as majority of outbreak verifications currently conducted by the World Health Organization's Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network are triggered by reports from nontraditional sources. the use of news media and other nontraditional sources of surveillance data can facilitate early outbreak detection, increase public awareness of disease outbreaks prior to their formal recognition. health officials, nongovernmental organizations, and concerned citizens must routinely search and synthesize a continually growing number of disparate sources in order to use this information. healthMap is a multistream real-time surveillance platform that continually aggregates reports on new and ongoing infectious disease outbreaks. the system performs extraction, categorization, filtration, and integration of these reports, facilitating knowledge management and early detection. the system collects an average of 300 reports per day, with the majority acquired from news media sources (85.1%) the system collects an average of 300 reports per day, with the majority acquired from news media sources. over the evaluation time period, 174 countries had reports of infectious disease outbreaks, with the greatest reporting from the united states (n = 4351), the United Kingdom (n = 1018), Canada (n = 880) and China (n = 737) there was a clear bias towards increased reporting from countries with higher numbers of media outlets, more developed public health resources, and greater availability of electronic communication infrastructure (approximated by number of Internet hosts) healthMap makes use of a Bayesian machine learning algorithm to automatically tag and separate breaking news. duplicate reports are filtered, identified, and grouped based on the similarity of the article's headline, body text, and disease and location categories. healthMap relies on a variety of electronic media sources, including online news sources through aggregators such as Google News, expert-curated discussion such as ProMED-mail [13,21,22] and validated official reports from organizations such as the WHO. the system collects an average of 300 reports per day, with the majority acquired from news media sources (85.1%) we ran a 43-week evaluation of healthMap data, covering the period of October 1, 2006 through July 18 2007. we found that pathogen diversity was substantial across news sources, with 141 unique infectious disease categories reported through the Google News feed alone. we found the frequency of reports about particular pathogens to be related not to their associated morbidity or mortality impact, but rather to the direct or potential economic and social disruption caused by the outbreak. healthMap draws from a continually expanding dictionary of pathogens (human, plant, and animal diseases) and geographic names (country, province, state, and city) to classify outbreak alert information. disease and place names are often ambiguous, colloquial, and subject to change. all articles related to a given outbreak are aggregated by text similarity matching in order to provide a situational awareness report. other outbreaks occurring in the same geographic area or involving the same pathogen are provided. potential future challenges include better meta-data tagging if/when the semantic Web becomes a reality. future work must also focus on improving natural language processing capability to clearly identify the pathogen, filter non-pertinent reports and duplicates. healthMap is a member of a new generation of surveillance systems that mine media sources in near real-time for reports of infectious disease outbreaks. such integration could yield a more precise relevance score for a given report, define populations at risk, and predict disease spread. the monitoring of diverse media-based sources will increase epidemic intelligence with information derived outside the traditional public health infrastructure. a truly open and accessible system can also assist users in overcoming existing geographical, organizational, and societal barriers to information."}
