{"summary": "Scientific Knowledge on the Subject Non-ELR chemokine CXCL10 and its receptor CXCR3 control neutrophil-mediated severe pulmonary inflammation. the axis represents a therapeutic target in the treatment of the acute phase of acute respiratory distress syndrome of nonviral and viral origins. cxcl10 (36), cxcr3 (37), trif (38) mutant mice have been previously described. cxcl10 (36), cxcr3 (37), trif (38), and Ifnar1 mutant mice are C57BL/6. each 30 minutes, elastance was calculated as (Pplat PEEPt)/Vt. acid aspiration\u2013induced Acute Lung Injury model in mice. mice were anesthetized with ketamine (75 mg/kg) and xylazine (20 mg/kg) intraperitoneally, tracheostomized, and ventilated. mice were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (75 mg/kg) and xylazine (20 mg/kg) mice were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (75 mg/kg) and xylazine (20 mg/kg) mice were ventilated at rate of 150 breaths/min at a Vt of 10 ml/kg. we measured airway elastance as well as tissue elastance in mice at 1, 2, and 5 days after infection with influenza virus or mock controls. the strain was isolated and characterized according to European guidelines. aliquots of culture supernatants or tissue lysates were serially diluted. each 30 minutes, airway elastance was calculated as (Pplat PEEPt)/Vt. each 30 minutes, airway elastance was calculated as (Pplat PEEPt) recipient mice were irradiated with 1,200 rads. BM cells were delivered intravenously through tail vein of each recipient mouse. chimeras were used for experiments 12 weeks after BM transplantation. the calculation of log fold-changes and the moderated t statistics was accomplished using the Limma package (42) for KEGG pathway enrichment analysis we used DAVID Bioinformatics Resources 6.7 (NIH) for KEGG pathway enrichment analysis we used a rabbit anti-mouse CXCL10 polyclonal antibody. -goat Alexa488 Ab (Invitrogen), rat Ly6-G Ab (BD), and anti-rat Alexa 568 Ab (Invitrogen) nuclei were stained with Hoechst33342 (Invitrogen) images were visualized using an A1Rsi confocal microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) isolated neutrophils were isolated from WT and CXCL10 KO mice. Isolated neutrophils (1 106) in 100 l of media were injected intratracheally into CXCL10 KO mice. 30 minutes after neutrophil transfer, recipient CXCL10 KO mice were subject to acid aspiration\u2013induced lung injury model. first-strand cDNA was synthesized from the DNA-free RNA. samples were subjected to real-time PCR quantification using Takara reverse-transcription reagents. Chemotaxis assay BM neutrophils were isolated from WT mice. they were infected with influenza virus (PR8/H1N1) (MOI = 3) or mock for 3 hours. bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) patients were sedated, and bronchoscopically guided lavage was performed in the middle lobe. aliquots (20 ml) were instilled and immediately reaspirated. samples were stored in aliquots of 50 l at 80\u00b0C until assayed. line was used to measure arterial blood pressure (Pd 23; Gould, Inc., Cleveland, OH) mice were ventilated for 3 hours (FiO2, 1.0; PEEP, 2.5 cm H2O) after intratracheal instillation of HCl (pH = 1.5; 2 ml/kg), rats were ventilated for 3 hours (FiO2, 1.0; PEEP, 2.5 cm H2O). mice were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of ketamine and xylazine. mice were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of ketamine. trachea was exposed by opening the neck skin and blunt dissection. mice were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (75 mg/kg) and xylazine (20 mg/kg) mice were ventilated at rate of 150 breaths/min at a Vt of 10 ml/kg. catheter was inserted into the trachea. aliquots of culture supernatants or tissue lysates were serially diluted with Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle medium, applied in quadruplicate to 2 104 MDCK cells/well of a 96-well plate. the inoculum was removed, and the cells were washed with PBS and supplied with Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle medium containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin. BM cells were plated on 2 104 cells/well of a 96-well plate (Asahi Techno Glass) at 24 hours after infection with serially diluted supernatants, the cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and washed with PBS three times. pooled RNA was hybridized to Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA) rat RGUA34 GeneChips in duplicate. raw CEL files were normalized with the RMA method from the \u201cAffy\u201d package. immunohistochemistry and Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy Lung tissue was fixed in 10% buffered formalin and processed for immunohistochemistry. a rabbit anti-mouse CXCL10 polyclonal antibody (R&D Systems Inc.) was used. the digested cell suspension was then layered on 50% Ficoll. the digested cell suspension was then centrifuged at 400 g for 40 minutes. cells were isolated by flushing the femur with Hanks\u2019 balanced salt solution. myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was assayed as reported previously (22) lung tissues were homogenized and sonicated in 50 mmol/L potassium phosphate buffer containing hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. the enzymatic activity was determined spectrometrically, and values represent the change in OD/min per gram tissue weight. cells were incubated with 56 M isoluminol (Tokyo Kasei Kogyo, Tokyo, Japan) and 4.4 U/ml horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) for 10 minutes at 37\u00b0C. the light emission was recorded at fixed time intervals. time courses were analyzed by repeated measurements (mixed model) analysis of variance. log-rank tests were performed on Kaplan-Meier survival curves. functional enrichment analysis identified cytokine\u2013cytokine receptor interaction and cytokine signaling as the top KEGG pathways overrepresented among differentially expressed genes after acid aspiration. mRNA for CXCL2 and IFN-1 were up-regulated in acid-treated lungs. inflammatory cell infiltration (green arrowheads) and pulmonary hemorrhage (red arrowhead) in acid-treated lungs. Neutrophil numbers were higher in acid-treated lungs than in control lungs. bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) in control subjects (n = 17) bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) in patients with ARDS with nonviral origins (n = 10). data in a, b, d, f\u2013h are presented as mean SEM. n = 6 for virus-infected group; n = 4 for control group. **P 0.01 compared with control lungs. data in a, c, e, and f are presented as mean SEM. n = 6 for acid-treated groups; n = 4 for saline-treated groups. *P 0.05 for the whole time course comparing acid-treated WT mice. mRNA of virus NP protein from lungs increased after infection (Figure E2b) at 1, 2, and 5 days after infection with influenza virus or mock controls, we measured tissue elastance (Figure 2a) and airway elastance (Figure E2c) in mice, which represent the mechanical properties of the lung tissue and airways. CXCL2 and IFN-1 were up-regulated in virus-treated lungs. this data indicate that CXCL10 is increased in the acute phase of viral lung injury/ARDS. acid aspiration resulted in rapid impairment of lung function in mice. 3 KO mice showed improved lung function (Figure 3e) and histological changes (Figure 3f) type I IFNs were also up-regulated in the acid-treated lungs in WT mice. changes in lung function after acid aspiration were comparable. titers at 3, 5, and 7 days after infection were comparable among WT, CXCL10 KO, and CXCR3 KO mice. survival and neutrophil counts in BAL fluid 5 days after infection were not different between IFNAR1 KO and WT mice. these data indicate that deletion of CXCL10 or CXCR3 but not IFNAR1 markedly improved the severity of viral lung injury. n = 4 for each group. n = 7 for each group. n = 7 for each group. n = 4 for each group. a bolus intratracheal instillation of inactivated H5N1 influenza virus caused rapid impairment of lung function. CXCL10 KO mice treated with this virus showed improved elastance (Figure 4h) and histological signs of lung injury. deletion of CXCL10 or CXCR3 improved the severity of influenza virus\u2013induced lung injury most likely independent of virus replication. CXCL10 in hematopoietic cells, including macrophages and neutrophils, controls the severity of lung injury/ARDS. we found abundant CXCL10-positive cells in the acid-treated lung at 3 hours (Figure 5a, right upper panel) and influenza virus\u2013infected lungs 5 days after infection. arrowheads mark positive staining of CXCL-10. expression in macrophages and neutrophils isolated from acid-treated lungs. n = 5 for each group. **P 0.01 compared with control neutrophils. representative data from three independent experiments are shown. CXCR3 expression in macrophages and neutrophils isolated from virus-treated lungs in TRIF knockout (KO) mice. n = 4 for each group.**P 0.01 compared with TRIF KO mice. flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that CXCR3 expression was higher in BAL neutrophils obtained from influenza virus infected\u2013mice than BM-derived naive neutrophils. we previously demonstrated that the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-TRIF axis represents a common pathway responsible for lung injury (22) we therefore investigated whether TRIF is involved in the induction of CXCR3 in inflamed neutrophils. chemotaxis activity toward CXCL2 was enhanced by CXCL10 in neutrophils isolated from the acid-treated but not from control lungs. such inflamed neutrophils expressed CXCR3 (Figures 5d\u20135h) these data suggest that CXCL10 can enhance oxidative burst as well as chemotaxis in inflamed, but not in naive, neutrophils. changes in tissue elastances after acid treatment of CXCL10 KO mice. mice were subjected to an acid aspiration\u2013induced lung injury model. neutrophils isolated from WT or CXCL10 KO mice were adoptively transferred into CXCL10 KO mice. the mice were subjected to an acid aspiration\u2013induced lung injury model. compared with transfer of CXCL10 KO neutrophils into CXCL10 KO mice. the number of neutrophils in lung lavage fluid was markedly elevated in the acid-treated animals at 3 hours. total RNA was extracted from lung tissue in rats treated with acid (acid group) or rats without acid instillation (control group) and hybridized to Affymetrix rat RGUA34 GeneChips. a total of 625 genes were significantly changed after acid aspiration for 3 hours. patients with acute-phase ARDS of nonviral origin had high CXCL10 levels in both plasma and BAL fluid irrespective of ARDS etiology. these data indicate that CXCL10 is increased in the acute phase of nonviral ARDS. f) CXCL10 mRNA (upper panel) and protein concentration (lower panel) in lungs of control and acid-treated animals at 3 hours. n = 4 for control group; n = 6 for acid-treated group. massive inflammatory cell infiltration (green arrowheads) found on day 5 after infection in the virus-infected lungs. n = 6 for virus-infected group; n = 4 for control group. Neutrophil numbers markedly elevated in the virus-infected lungs. CXCL10 KO mice exhibited reduced inflammatory cell infiltration (green arrowhead) and hemorrhage (red arrowhead) shown in WT mice. original magnifications 200. Neutrophil counts in lung lavage fluid 3 hours after acid treatment. mRNA of virus NP protein from lungs increased after infection. inflammatory cells increased on day 2 and alveolar wall thickening, pulmonary edema, hemorrhage, and inflammatory cell infiltration were found. pathway enrichment analysis identified enrichment for Toll-like receptor signaling and cytokine\u2013cytokine receptor interaction KEGG pathways. up-regulation of CXCL10 mRNA in lungs of virus-treated mice was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR. MPO activity was reduced in lungs of acid-treated CXCL10 KO mice. production of CXCL2, a potent neutrophil chemoattractant (Figure E3b) also reduced in lungs from acid-treated CXCL10 KO mice. neutralization of CXCL10 with a specific antibody improved pulmonary function. we tested whether CXCL10 or CXCR3 deficiency could improve the severity of influenza virus\u2013induced lung injury. compared with WT mice, CXCL10 KO (Figure 4a) or CXCR3 KO (Figure 4b) mice exhibited improved survival in mice infected with influenza virus (PR8/H1N1). n = 7 for each group. **P 0.01 compared with WT mice. survival of WT or CXCR3 KO mice infected with influenza (PR8/H1N1) virus. inactivated H5N1 virus-treated mice showed reduced inflammatory cell infiltration (green arrowhead), hemorrhage (red arrowhead), edema (blue arrowhead) and hyaline membrane formation (yellow arrowhead), shown in inactivated H5N1 virus-treated mice. transfer of CXCL10 KO BM into CXCL10 KO recipients significantly improved lung functions (Figure E4a) and reduced pulmonary MPO activity (Figure E4b) and CXCL2 levels (Figure E4c) in an acid aspiration\u2013induced lung injury model. compared with mice with CXCL10 mutations in BM cells. CXCL10 was largely produced in fulminant phase of neutrophils. but not by naive neutrophils in both nonviral and viral lung injury. other non-ELR motif CXC chemokines CXCL9 and IFN- were largely produced in macrophages rather than in injured lungs. cells obtained by bronchioalveolar lavage (BAL) from mice infected with influenza virus (PR8/H1N1) for 5 days. CXCR3 was mapped to Ly6G-positive neutrophils in BAL fluid obtained from virus-infected mice, but not BM-derived naive neutrophils. representative data from three independent experiments are shown. flow cytometric analysis showed that CXCR3 expression was higher in BAL neutrophils obtained from influenza virus infected\u2013mice than BM-derived naive neutrophils. mRNA was significantly up-regulated in neutrophils in lungs obtained from mice treated with acid for 3 hours or influenza virus infection for 5 days. induction of CXCL10 originating from neutrophils and a unique neutrophil population expressing CXCR3 in fulminant lung injury. treatment with CXCL10 enhanced fMLP-induced superoxide generation in neutrophils isolated from acid-treated versus control lungs. neutrophils were isolated from lungs obtained from wild-type (WT) or CXCL10 knockout (KO) mice at 3 hours after acid treatment. changes in tissue elastances after acid treatment were shown. XCR3 KO mice intratracheally transplanted with WT neutrophils (WT neutrophilsCXCR3 KO), and CXCR3 KO mice receiving CXCR3 KO neutrophils (CXCR3 KO neutrophilsCXCR3 KO) were shown. n = 5 for each group. non-ELR CXC chemokines were believed to be chemoattractant for T cells and NK cells but not neutrophils (8\u201310). the increased levels of CXCL10 in lungs with lung injury originated to a large extent from infiltrated pulmonary neutrophils, which express a unique CXCR3 receptor. the clinical course and pathophysiological features of ARDS are marked by three phases: exudative (acute), proliferative (subacute), and fibrotic (late) some patients with ARDS who survive the exudative phase enter a fibrotic phase that may require long-term ventilator support. CXCL10-CXCR3 axis represents an interesting therapeutic target for treatment of patients during the acute phase of ARDS."}
