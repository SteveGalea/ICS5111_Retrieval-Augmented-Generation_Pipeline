{"summary": "human airway epithelium (HAE) represents the entry port of many human respiratory viruses. coV infections are associated mainly with respiratory and enteric diseases (1\u20133). HCoVs are associated with mild respiratory tract disease (common cold) that may cause more severe symptoms in elderly individuals (6\u201311) the fastidious nature of HCoVs on conventional cell lines was described during the mid-1960s and led to ex vivo culturing of human embryo respiratory tract explants (4, 5, 22, 23) the pseudostratified HAE cell culture system is used as an alternative and convenient in vitro tool to propagate and characterize newly identified human respiratory viruses (24). thus far, one isolate of HCoV-HKU1\u2014which is refractory to propagation on conventional cell lines\u2014has HCoV-229E (Inf-1) cell culture supernatant was harvested after 7 days. HCoV-OC43 (VR-759) was obtained from the ATCC. twelve nasopharyngeal specimens were collected in 2010. human airway epithelial cells were isolated from patients who underwent bronchoscopy and/or surgical lung resection in their diagnostic pathway for any pulmonary disease. written informed consent was provided by all participants. bronchial segments were incubated for 48 h at +4\u00b0C in minimal essential medium. bronchial epithelial cell serum-free growth medium (BEGM) was refreshed at 2- or 3-day intervals. aliquot of 50 l of clinical patient material or cell culture supernatant was diluted in 200 l Hanks balanced salt solution. the inoculum was collected and stored in an equal volume of homemade virus transport medium (VTM; MEM supplemented with 0.5% gelatin) the apical surface was rinsed three times with 500 l of HBSS, and inoculated cultures were maintained at 33\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 incubator. 10 microliters of cDNA were amplified in 50 l 1 Platinum quantitative PCR SuperMix\u2013uracil-DNA glycosylase (Invitrogen) ten microliters of cDNA were amplified in 50 l 1 Platinum quantitative PCR SuperMix\u2013uracil-DNA glycosylase (invitrogen) with 5.0 mM MgCl2, 10 M specific probe labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) and infected HAE cultures were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA; FormaFix) for 30 min at room temperature, followed by rinsing of the apical and basolateral sides three times with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) fixed HAE cultures were immunostained using a previously described procedure (34) goat IgG(H+L) and Dylight 647-labeled anti-rabbit IgG(H+L) were applied as secondary antibodies, followed by a separate incubation with mouse anti-tubulin (1:1,000; Sigma) the above-described staining combinations were counterstained with DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; Invitrogen) before the membranes were dissected. the HCoV-NL63 virus stock was obtained by inoculating a monolayer of LLC-MK2 cells as described previously (19) the supernatant was harvested after 7 days and stored in aliquots at 80\u00b0C, after removal of cellular debris by centrifugation. five additional HCoV-NL63-positive nasopharyngeal specimens were obtained from the EU-financed GRACE study (http://www.grace-lrti.org) one HCoV-NL63 clinical sample has been described previously (29) normal human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEpC) were isolated from patients who underwent bronchoscopy and/or surgical lung resection in their diagnostic pathway for any pulmonary disease. written informed consent was provided by all study participants. beGM was refreshed at 2- or 3-day intervals. aliquot of 50 l of clinical patient material or cell culture supernatant was diluted in 200 l Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS) the apical surface was rinsed three times with 500 l of HBSS. viral RNA was isolated from 100 l of apical or basolateral harvest. elution was performed in 100 l RNase-free H2O. elution was performed in 60 l RNase-free H2O. measurements were done with an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detection system. followed the UDG treatment for 2 min at 50\u00b0C and denaturing for 10 min at 95\u00b0C. 45 cycles of amplification (15 s at 95\u00b0C and 60 s at 60\u00b0C) were performed. ouse IgG(H+L) and Dylight 594-labeled anti-human IgG(H+L) (1:200) were applied as secondary antibodies. monoclonal anti-dsRNA (J2; English & Scientific Consulting Bt.) and goat polyclonal anti-ZO1 (1:200; Abcam) were applied as primary antibodies. primary bronchial segments and pseudostratified HAE cell cultures were fixed with 4% PFA (FormaFix) for 30 min at room temperature, followed by rinsing of the samples three times with PBS. monoclonal anti-tubulin (Sigma) and sheep polyclonal anti-human CD13 (R&D Systems) were applied as primary antibodies. an aliquot of 50 l of each sample was diluted 1:5 in HBSS. then 200 l of diluted sample was used to inoculate the apical surface of a pseudostratified HAE cell culture. the cultures were maintained at 33\u00b0C, and 200-l harvests were collected from the apical surface at 2, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, and 168 hpi. a steep increase of viral RNA yields could be detected for only one isolate (R2354). the low isolation rate of new HCoV-NL63 isolates directly from clinical specimens suggests that HCoV-NL63 is more difficult to isolate than the other three HCoV species. Inoculation of HAE cultures was done using approximately 5 105 genome copies per milliliter. the release of progeny virus at the apical surface was monitored at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hpi. for HCoV-NL63, the reference strain reached higher titers. alterations in HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E reference strains did not seem to influence replication kinetics in the human airway epithelium. the results of a representative experiment are shown. s were determined on HAE cultures derived from three different donors. the same experimental conditions were used, except that the release of progeny viral RNA was monitored at 2, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 hpi for the apical surface and at 48 and 120 hpi for the basolateral compartment. however, in cells from one donor (3011), we observed reduced viral growth kinetics for both viruses during the first 72 h. HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 are known to employ a target cell tropism predominantly for ciliated cells on HAEs. similar studies to determine the target cell tropism of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 have not yet been reported. the colocalization results show that IVIg-positive cells in HCoV-OC43-, HCoV-HKU1-, and HCoV-NL63-infected HAE cultures were predominantly ciliated cells. in contrast, surprisingly, HCoV-229E-infected cells were predominantly nonciliated. the same results were obtained by infecting HAE cultures with the corresponding laboratory reference HCoV strains. antibody has been shown to bind dsRNA independent of sequence and nucleotide composition (38) to detect each HCoV strain and species, independent of their genomic composition. a tight junction marker (ZO-1) and a ciliated cell marker (-tubulin) were incorporated to accurately discriminate the localization of the dsRNA complexes. dsRNA antibody staining in parallel with the cellular markers gave a more detailed view of the number of HCoV-infected cells. dsRNA antibody staining in parallel with the cellular markers gave a more detailed view of the number of HCoV-infected cells. for each HCoV strain, time point, and donor, we analyzed five randomly selected fields across the HAE culture. HCoV-HKU1 (P = 0.0007) infect predominantly ciliated cells. the target cell tropism of each HCoV strain correlates with the distribution pattern of its cellular receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme II. HCoV-229E uses human aminopeptidase N (CD13) as a cellular receptor. however, the distribution pattern of this receptor on human airway epithelial cells has not been defined. we assessed the distribution pattern of human aminopeptidase N (CD13) in vivo and in vitro using bronchial lung resections. an aliquot of 50 l of each sample was diluted 1:5 in HBSS. then 200 l of diluted sample was used to inoculate the apical surface of a pseudostratified HAE cell culture. the cultures were incubated for 2 h at 33\u00b0C, followed by removal and rinsing. six additional clinical specimens known to be positive for HCoV-NL63 were selected to isolate new contemporary HCoV-NL63 isolates. the low isolation rate of new HCoV-NL63 isolates directly from clinical specimens suggests that HCoV-NL63 is more difficult to isolate than the other three HCoV species. Inoculation of HAE cultures was done as described above. the release of progeny virus at the apical surface was monitored at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hpi. the results indicated that the genomic alterations in the HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E reference strains did not seem to influence their replication kinetics in the human airway epithelium. the monitored viral yields are given for the cell culture-adapted reference strains versus representative clinical isolates. strains were determined on HAE cultures derived from three different donors. the same experimental conditions were used, except that the release of progeny viral RNA was monitored at 2, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 hpi for the apical surface and 48 and 120 hpi for the basolateral compartment. HCoV-HKU1 (A), HCoV-229E (B), HCoV-OC43 (C) and HCoV-NL63 (D) strains are known to employ a target cell tropism predominantly for ciliated cells on HAEs. similar studies to determine target cell tropism of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 have not yet been reported. the colocalization results show that IVIg-positive cells in HCoV-OC43-, HCoV-HKU1-, and HCoV-NL63-infected HAE cultures were predominantly ciliated cells. in contrast, HCoV-229E-infected cells were predominantly nonciliated. the same results were obtained by infecting HAE cultures with the corresponding laboratory reference HCoV strains. monoclonal antibody has been shown to bind dsRNA independent of sequence and nucleotide composition (38). a tight junction marker (ZO-1) and a ciliated cell marker (-tubulin) were incorporated to accurately discriminate the localization of dsRNA complexes among different cell types present in the HAE cultures. the results are shown as means and SD for 5 randomly selected fields from 2 independent experiments. the dsRNA antibody staining in parallel with the cellular markers gave a more detailed view of the number of HCoV-infected cells. we characterized target cell tropisms of the different HCoV strains in HAE cultures quantitatively. HCoV-HKU1 (P = 0.0007) infects predominantly ciliated cells. the target cell tropism of each HCoV strain is not strictly limited to a certain cell type. HCoV-229E uses human aminopeptidase N (CD13) as a cellular receptor. however, the distribution pattern of this receptor on human airway epithelial cells has not been defined. we assessed the distribution pattern of human aminopeptidase N (CD13) in vivo and in vitro using bronchial lung resections. HCoV-229E has a preference to infect nonciliated cells, whereas HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 all prefer ciliated cells. HCoV-OC43 infects predominantly ciliated cells, with apical release of progeny virus. this was not documented before for either HCoV-NL63 (26, 41) or HCoV-OC43. we did not detect any cytopathic effect in HAE cultures. this suggests that apical release of progeny virus is the predominant viral exit route as long as the epithelium remains intact. the difficulty in acquiring new HCoV-NL63 isolates from clinical specimens suggests that this virus is more fastidious than the other HCoV strains. the difficulty in culturing this strain was suspected in light of the late discovery of HCoV-NL63. of 12 HCoV-positive samples contained replication-competent HCoV-HKU1 confirms that HCoV-HKU1 is a contemporary HCoV strain. recombination is a major driving force of coronavirus evolution, and intraspecies recombination events have already been proposed for HCoV-OC43, -HKU1 and -NL63 (29, 47, 48) the HAE culture system allows detailed characterization of the cell tropism and apical/basolateral release of zoonotic CoVs. the system will greatly facilitate the isolation of emerging respiratory virus strains that are refractory to growth on conventional cell lines."}
