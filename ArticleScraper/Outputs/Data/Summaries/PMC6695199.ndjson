{"summary": "human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading viral cause of severe lower respiratory tract infections in infants and young children worldwide annually. no licensed vaccine or effective antiviral drug is available, although a number of vaccine and drug candidates are under development. the G protein contains a CX3C motif reported to mediate cell attachment by binding to the chemokine receptor CX3CR1 [11, 12] nucleolin also has been reported as a cellular receptor for RSV that is bound by the F protein [13], but how this occurs was unknown. a genome-wide siRNA screen was performed to identify cellular proteins with presumptive roles in RSV infection. a subpopulation of Na+,K+-ATPase that is localized in caveolae can engage in signal transduction via the ATP1A1 subunit [17, 26\u201328]. humans express three additional -isoforms beside ATP1A1 (ATP1A2, ATP1A3 and ATP1A4) ATP1A1 initiates signaling by conferring a conformational change to c-Src. activated c-Src can mediate phosphorylation and activation of EGFR in an EGF-independent manner [31, 32], which can induce macropinocytosis [31, 32], similar to the well-characterized EGF-induced macropinocytosis [33, 34], which can induce clathrin-mediated endocytosis the cardiotonic steroid ouabain or the digitoxigenin derivative PST2238 inhibit ATP1A1 activation and signaling in the caveolae. ATP1A1 was among the genes with the strongest effect on RSV-GFP (S1 Table) siRNA 1 reduced the ATP1A1 protein expression at 48 h p.t. to 39% (siRNA1 and 3) and 35% (siRNA2) and did not show any further reduction at 72 h p.t. siRNA 1 and 2 have no known target in human cells. Western blot analyses of three independent experiments were quantified, normalized to alpha-tubulin, and reported relative to Neg. siRNA 1 assigned the value of 1.0. the transfected cells showed no visible cytotoxicity or morphological changes over the period of 72 h p.t. the ATP1A1 siRNA knockdown showed only minimal reductions in cell viability. knockdown of ATP1A1 resulted in a broad reduction in GFP expression in the infected-cell population rather than a reduction in the number of GFP-expressing cells. ATP1A1 knockdown was specific to RSV, did not affect VSV, and was not due to some general effect on cellular functions. ATP1A1 siRNA 2 showed the strongest effect against both GFP expression and virus production. the effect of transfection with the panel of siRNAs on the production of progeny RSV-GFP was assessed 24 h p.i. clusters of ATP1A1 were observed as early as 15 min p.i. with time, the ATP1A1 clusters became more prominent and numerous. the localization of clustered ATP1A1 in close proximity to RSV F became more noticeable at later time points. a549 cells were inoculated with wt RSV, rgRSV-dSH or rgRSV-dSH/dG (MOI = 10 PFU/cell) and incubated for 5 h. images (z-stacks) were acquired on a leica SP8 confocal microscope. the ATP1A1 clustering occurred at the cell surface and was localized close to the RSV virions. we hypothesized that ATP1A1 might be involved in an early step of infection such as viral entry. the lack of ATP1A1 cluster formation with the dSH/dG virus suggested that its signaling function might play a role in RSV infection. ATP1A1 signaling cascades can result in the induction of endocytosis including clathrin-mediated or caveolin-mediated endocytosis. ATP1A1 and EGFR had homogeneous membrane distributions. after 24 h treatment with ouabain, the ATP1A1 level was greatly reduced. EGFR expression and localization of ATP1A1 or EGFR appeared unchanged. h with either 25 nM ouabain or 20 M PST2238 were inoculated with RSV-GFP (MOI = 1 PFU/cell) cells were incubated for 17 h and infectivity was quantified by: (B) GFP signal of the total well, scanned by an ELISA reader and reported relative to mock-treated infected cells as 1.0. a \u201ctime of addition\u201d experiment was performed to investigate the stage of RSV infection that is inhibited by the compounds. the strongest inhibitory effect was observed when the inhibitor was added simultaneously with RSV-GFP at 0 h, resulting in 85% and 66% reduction of GFP expression by ouabain and PST2238. c-Src-kinase activity is required for infection. PP2 and Src-Inhibitior I (SrcI-I) were pre-treated with these inhibitors separately or together for 5 h. each Src-inhibitor showed a modest but significant reduction. EGFR knockdown reduces RSV infection Next, we investigated whether EGFR, a downstream signaling partner of Src-kinase, made a contribution to RSV infection. we identified an EGFR-specific siRNA that reduced EGFR expression in A549 cells to 15% at the protein level compared to Neg. siRNA1 48 h p.t. ATP1A1 and EGFR expression in A549 cells transfected with siRNAs targeting ATP1A1 or EGFR. siRNA 1 or 2, incubated for 48 h, and subjected to immunofluorescence staining for ATP1A1 (green) and EGFR (red) as described for Fig 4A. EGFR knockdown resulted in a nearly 50% reduction in viral GFP expression. compared to Neg. siRNA 1 (p = 0.0001) or mock-transfected cells (p = 0.0001) there was a modest but consistent reduction in PFU titer for Neg. siRNA 2 (p = 0.0015) ATP1A1-dependent EGFR phosphorylation at Tyr845 during RSV infection. pTyr845 EGFR signals of three independent experiments were quantified by scanning and normalized to the signal of the internal array positive controls and pan EGFR. pTyr845 was phosphorylated at Tyr845, which was not detected for uninfected cells. both samples showed nearly equivalent phosphorylation of ErbB2 (another member of the human EGFR family) pTyr845 in RSV-infected cells was significantly reduced in the ATP1A1 siRNA knockdown cells. phosphorylation of pTyr845 was not affected as compared to mock-treated cells. phosphorylation at EGFR Tyr845 could be reduced either by decreasing ATP1A1 expression or by ATP1A1- or Src-specific inhibitors. macropinocytosis is induced by RSV and is mediated by ATP1A1 EGFR signaling. nuclei were counterstained with DAPI, and nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. dextran-positive vesicles were small, round, and homogeneous in size. phenotype changed dramatically by 5 h after infection with wt RSV. cells were infected with RSV in the presence of dextran-AF568, incubated for 5 h, fixed, and permeabilized as described in B. Arrows indicate co-localization of ATP1A1 (green) and RSV N (red) in dextran-AF568-positive (cyan) vesicles. arrows indicate RSV F (green) and RSV N (red) in dextran-AF568-positive vesicles. all scale bars are 10 m. (D\u2013F) Quantification of dextran-AF568 uptake. a549 cells were infected with RSV in the presence of dextran-AF568 (cyan) and at 5 h p.i. were co-stained for ATP1A1 (AF488; green) and RSV N (marker of RSV virions; AF647; red) and visualized by fluorescence confocal microscopy. dextran vesicles larger than 1.0 m3 were excluded to omit basal level of dextran uptake. the total intensity of dextran vesicles larger than 1.0 m3 was determined per field. this showed that dextran uptake was increased 4-fold in RSV-infected as compared to uninfected-cells. preliminary studies in our hands using an inhibitor of clathrin-mediated endocytosis did not detect effects on RSV infection at non-cytotoxic concentrations. however, preliminary studies in our hands using an inhibitor of clathrin-mediated endocytosis did not detect effects on RSV infection at non-cytotoxic concentrations. cholesterol depletion results in reduced EGFR transactivation, reduced macropinocytosis, and reduced RSV infection. results show that cholesterol depletion results in reduced EGFR transactivation, reduced macropinocytosis, and reduced RSV infection. phosphorylation of EGFR Tyr845 was quantified by an EGFR phosphorylation antibody array. the level of pTyr845 was reported relative to mock-treated infected cells. IC50 titrations of compounds on HSAEC for RSV-GFP expression showed that the values were lower in HSAEC than A549 cells by 4.9-fold for ouabain. iv) RSV-induced ATP1A1 clustering and colocalization of ATP1A1 and RSV N also was observed in HSAEC. ATP1A1 clustering and colocalization with RSV N protein in HSAEC cells. cells were infected with wt RSV (106 PFU/transwell), incubated for 1h or 5 h, fixed with PFA, permeabilized with TritonX-100, and immunostained for RSV F (red) and ATP1A1 (green) RSV induces ATP1A1 clustering in human airway epithelial-air liquid interface (HAE-ALI) cultures were inoculated with wt RSV (106 PFU/tissue), incubated for 1 or 5 h, fixed and subjected to immunofluorescence staining. images are shown without (A) and with (B) F-Actin staining. ATP1A1 mRNA level and expression of ATP1A1 protein were quantified at different time points post transfection. siRNA1 at 48 h p.t. and time course over 72 h. at 48 h post transfection, the level of ATP1A1 mRNA was reduced to below 5% compared to Neg. Western blot analyses were quantified, normalized to alpha-tubulin, and reported relative to Neg. the transfected cells showed no visible cytotoxicity or morphological changes over the period of 72 h p.t. the ATP1A1 siRNA knockdown showed only minimal reductions in cell viability. ATP1A1 knockdown had no effect on vesicular stomatitis virus expressing GFP (VSV-GFP) knockdown of ATP1A1 resulted in broad reduction in GFP expression in the infected-cell population rather than a reduction in the number of GFP-expressing cells. the plot (C) shows cell count versus GFP intensity, and the histogram (D) shows GFP MFI relative to cells infected with the same virus for which the transfected siRNA was Neg. ATP1A1 siRNA 2 showed the strongest effect against both GFP expression and virus production. wt RSV infection triggers ATP1A1 clustering. clusters of ATP1A1 were observed as early as 15 min p.i.. wt RSV infection triggers ATP1A1 clustering. a549 cells were inoculated with wt RSV, rgRSV-dSH or rgRSV-dSH/dG (MOI = 10 PFU/cell) and incubated for 5 h. ATP1A1 (green) was detected by an anti-ATP1A1 rabbit MAb (ab76020) and AF568-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody. a549 cells were infected with wt RSV, RSV dSH, or RSV dSH/dG (MOI = 10 PFU/cell) and incubated for 5 h. a549 cells were infected with wt RSV, RSV dSH, or RSV dSH/dG (MOI = 10 PFU/cell) dSH/dG virus did not induce any ATP1A1 clustering. dSH/dG virus did not induce any ATP1A1 clustering. dSH/dG virus did not induce any ATP1A1 clustering. EGFR was evaluated in addition to ATP1A1 because it previously was shown to be important for RSV entry [14]. in mock-treated cells, ATP1A1 and EGFR had homogeneous membrane distributions. after 24 h treatment with ouabain, the ATP1A1 level was greatly reduced. a549 cells pre-treated for 16 h with either 25 nM ouabain or 20 M PST2238 were inoculated with RSV-GFP (MOI = 1 PFU/cell) cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue) both methods correlated well, and showed a reduction in RSV replication for both compounds that was greater than that achieved with the ATP1A1-specific siRNAs. the strongest inhibitory effect was observed when the inhibitor was added simultaneously with RSV-GFP at 0 h, resulting in 85% and 66% reduction of GFP expression by ouabain and PST2238. ATP1A1 activates c-Src-kinase that transactivates EGFR signaling [17]. c-Src activity is required for RSV infection. PP2 and Src-Inhibitior I (SrcI-I) were treated separately or together for 5 h. A549 cells were pre-treated with non-cytotoxic concentrations of the indicated Src-kinase inhibitors (PP2 [12.5 M], SrcI-I [6.25 M] or both) or mock-treated (DMSO carrier control) for 5 h. cells were then inoculated with RSV-GFP (MOI = 1 PFU/cell) in media containing the indicated inhibitors. ATP1A1 and EGFR expression in A549 cells transfected with siRNAs targeting ATP1A1 or EGFR. siRNA 1 or 2, incubated for 48 h, and subjected to immunofluorescence staining for ATP1A1 and EGFR (red) EGFR knockdown cells were infected with RSV-GFP and infection was evaluated by viral GFP intensity quantified by ELISA reader 17 h p.i. and by plaque titration 24 h p.i. on Vero cells. EGFR knockdown resulted in a nearly 50% reduction in viral GFP expression as compared to Neg. siRNA 1 (p = 0.0001) lysates were prepared following 5 h of incubation with a phospho-specific EGFR antibody array. the cells were serum starved for 16 h and then inoculated with wt RSV. lysates were analyzed using an EGFR phosphorylation array. siRNA knockdown samples reported relative to Neg. siRNA1. chemical-treated samples reported relative to mock-treated, RSV-infected samples. pTyr845 EGFR signal was quantified by one-way analysis. the level of pTyr845 was reduced to 27% and 26% respectively. the reduction was similar to that observed for ATP1A1 knockdown. phosphorylation of pTyr845 was not affected as compared to mock-treated cells. dextran-positive vesicles were small, round, and homogeneous in size. phenotype changed dramatically by 5 h after infection with wt RSV. dextran-positive vesicles were smaller and irregular in shape. cells were infected with wt RSV (MOI = 5 PFU/cell) in medium containing dextran-AF568 (cyan) at 5 h p.i., cells were fixed with 4% PFA and nuclei counterstained with DAPI (blue), and imaged on a leica SP5 confocal microscope with a 40x Objective NA 1.3 and 2.0x zoom. Arrows indicate RSV F (green) and RSV N (red) in dextran-AF568-positive (cyan) vesicles. all scale bars are 10 m. (D\u2013F) Quantification of dextran-AF568 uptake. bars indicate the standard deviation of at least three independent experiments. the statistical significance of difference was determined for (D) and (E) by one-way analysis of variance with Tukey\u2019s multiple comparison post-test and for (F) by a two-tailed unpaired t-test. dextran vesicles larger than 1.0 m3 were excluded to omit basal level of dextran uptake. dextran uptake was increased 4-fold in RSV-infected as compared to uninfected-cells. knockdown of ATP1A1 caused a significant reduction of 33% compared to uninfected-cells. signaling from ATP1A1 also can induce clathrin-mediated endocytosis. however, preliminary studies in our hands did not detect effects on RSV infection at non-cytotoxic concentrations. the structural integrity of caveolae depends on the presence of cholesterol. a modest but significant reduction in pTyr845 was observed. cholesterol depletion results in reduced EGFR transactivation, reduced macropinocytosis, and reduced RSV infection, consistent with caveolae as the site of ATP1A1 signaling. the statistical significance of the differences was determined by one-way analysis of variance with Tukey\u2019s multiple-comparison post-test and p-values are indicated (ns, not significant). pTyr845 was reported relative to mock-treated infected cells. the inhibitory effects of ouabain and PST2238 on the expression of RSV-GFP were even stronger in HSAEC than in A549 cells. IC50 titrations of the compounds on HSAEC for RSV-GFP expression showed that the values were lower (i.e., more effective inhibition) in HSAEC than in A549 cells. IC50 values of ouabain and PST2238 for inhibiting RSV infection were 5- and 8-fold lower than for A549 cells. ATP1A1 clustering and colocalization with RSV N protein in HSAEC cells, in an experiment performed as in Fig 3. the apical ATP1A1 clusters were mostly visible in close proximity to RSV F. these observations were similar to those in A549 cells. ATP1A1 is the major subunit of Na+,K+-ATPase. homozygous ATP1A1-/- knock-out is lethal at the preweaning stage. no significant difference in the virus load was observed between ATP1A1+/- mice and their wild-type litter mates. treatment with PST2238 also reduced the efficiency of RSV infection. ATP1A1-binding drugs implicated ATP1A1 and ATP1A1 signaling. fluorescent protein (YFP) tag cells were infected with RSV, incubated for 1h and lysed. co-immunoprecipitation was performed with YFP-specific antibodies followed by Western blotting with antibodies to RSV proteins. however, there was no evidence of pull-down of RSV proteins. an initial virus attachment event involving G is required to trigger ATP1A1 clustering. this implies that an initial attachment event involving RSV G is needed to initiate ATP1A1 clustering. this implies that an initial attachment event involving G is needed to initiate ATP1A1 clustering. mediated endocytosis did not affect RSV infection. previous studies have suggested a role for macropinocytosis in RSV uptake. c-Src-kinase activity plays an important role during macropinosome formation. a model in which viral nucleocapsid virions are taken up by the macropinosome. membrane fusion and release of the nucleocapsid presumably taking place at a later step after the macropinocytic uptake. but the data do not exclude the possibility of clathrin-mediated endocytosis as an additional mode of RSV entry. ATP1A1-mediated signaling cascades have been reported to take place in the cholesterol-rich microdomains called caveolae [27, 28], which are thought to serve as a region to integrate multiple signaling pathways. many proteins associated with signaling functions are present in the caveolae, including ATP1A1, EGFR and c-Src [17, 50, 51] cholesterol is needed for the ouabain-induced ATP1A1-Src-EG ATP1A1 cluster formation was observed on the apical surface. the small amounts of apical ATP1A1 present in the uninfected cells is likely sufficient for initiating the signaling cascade. ATP1A1 also has been implicated as a pro-viral factor in the infection cycles of Ebola virus [52], coronavirus [53], hepatitis C virus [54], and mammarenaviruses [55], but the the prevailing paradigm of virus spread involves packaging, release, and infection of the neighboring cells. an emerging model suggests direct cell-to-cell spread of partially assembled virions, nucleocapsids, and inclusion bodies via intercellular channels. ATP1A1 may not have a role in this and would be primarily engaged in mediating uptake of the extracellular packaged virions. the ATP1A1-Src-EGFR signaling occurs predominantly in the cholesterol-rich domains of the caveolae which are thus important for efficient infection. this study identified ATP1A1 signaling as a new target for the development of anti-RSV drugs. normal human small airway epithelial cells were maintained in Opti-MEM I medium with GlutaMax-I (Life Technologies) supplemented with 5% FBS. recombinant viruses RSV-GFP [65], VSV-GFP [66], wt RSV A2 and rgRSV-dSH/dG [7] have been previously described. methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MBCD, PubChem CID: 1474853), PP2 (PubChem CID: 4878), methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MBCD, PubChem CID: 51051622) and Mevinolin (Lovastatin, PubChem CID: 53232) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO. the final transfection mixtures contained 1000 A549 cells and 20 nM siRNA in F12 medium and 10% FBS. the cells were incubated for 48 h, the cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde and stained with Hoechst 33342.
