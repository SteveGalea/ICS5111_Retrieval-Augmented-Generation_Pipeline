Summary of simulated observed hSAR for different household sizes from the estimated model. the observed hSAR lay within the 95% credible intervals obtained from the model simulated data. it is noticed that the observed hSAR lay within the 95% credible intervals obtained from the model simulated data, indicating a reasonably good fit of the model to the data (1, 2).

RT-PCR is the gold standard laboratory method for confirming viral respiratory infections among symptomatic individuals. we estimated the peak level of RT-PCR test sensitivity in this field study to be 79.6% [76.5%, 83.0%] for symptomatic infections. the value of this parameter (noninfection symptoms onset rate; see Materials and Methods) was assumed to be 0.001 in the baseline analysis (32, 33) we tried a range of alternative values and found that higher values were associated with higher rates of asymptomatic infection. however, the values of other model parameters were not materially affected. 1.7 [43.1, 76.9] = 0.002 64.4 [44.0, 79.3] = 0.0005 61.5 [43.0, 75.5] S 2 / S 1 = 0.75 67.4 [47.8, 84.6] S 2 / S 1 = 0.25 56.1 [39.3, 69.8] Weibull incubation 61.4 [43.0, 75.5] Lognormal incubation 61.5 [43.1, 76.4] Table S4 a single sample at day 5 would have the highest expected difference in observed hSAR. a single sample at day 4 would have a very similar expected difference between interventions and control but greater variance. in day 4 or day 5 we may have the most \u201cdetectable\u201d infections circulating in households. we only estimated the average efficacy of improved hand hygiene and face masks. adherence to hand hygiene intervention was similar to that reported in previous community studies. adherence to hand hygiene intervention was similar to that reported in previous community studies. data using a different approach found evidence suggesting that aerosol (small droplets) transmission might be responsible for approximately half of all influenza transmission in households (37). a small to medium effect of face masks and hand hygiene would be expected given that they are thought to reduce transmission via large droplets and contact. further extensions of our modeling framework could be considered in the future to account for different modes of transmission. control group ( n = 112 households), intervention group with improved hand hygiene ( n = 106) and intervention group with face masks and improved hand hygiene ( n = 104 ). all household contacts were required to keep daily symptom diaries within the observational period after the initial intervention. further nasal and throat swab specimens from all household members were collected in subsequent home visits. the hazard of infection H k j exerted on a susceptible member j was determined by coupling the infectivity profile with the household size and the age and time since infection of member k. interventions were assumed to reduce the magnitude of the infectivity profile by a constant proportion r i, where i = 1,2,3 corresponded to the control, HH and HH+FM arms. the test sensitivity of asymptomatic infections was assumed to be half that of symptomatic infections. households were assumed to be independent given the sparse recruitment. events above were also described mathematically in SI Text. in 2008, 407 index patients with influenza-like illness with symptom onset in the previous 48 h were recruited at outpatient clinics in Hong Kong. there were, in total, 322 eligible households who agreed to participate. each infected member was assumed to exhibit time-varying infectivity (i.e., hazard of infection) since infection, which was parameterized by its median a and mode b. children and adults were assumed to have different scaling factors i to the infectivity profile. a nonindex case has a probability p to be an asymptomatic infection. the onset time of a symptomatic case was determined by an assumed incubation period parameterized by and. markov chain Monte Carlo techniques (40) were applied to obtain the posterior distribution. we constructed the Markov chain in such a way that the stationary distribution was the posterior distribution P ( | x ) of interest. details of the construction of the likelihood function and of the McMC algorithm are given in SI Text. t P = ( t 1 P, t 2 P,..., t m P ) was the vector containing the testing times of the household, which was common for all household members in the household. p j, k 1,0, k = 1, 2,..., m, where 1 and 0 represented a positive result and negative result, respectively. the factors in Eq. S1 corresponded to likelihood contribution of infection events, symptoms onset times, RT-PCR test results, and the infection times of index cases. we assumed that the infectiousness of an infectee varied according to the time since infection. a is merely a nominal half-life of the infectivity profile as we truncated the profile at day 10. we reported the (effective) half-life corresponding to the truncated profile a e f f. was the hazard exerted by k at j determined by coupling the infectivity profile with the age of individuals k and j (i.e., the heterogeneity of infectivity among different age groups), household size, and the time since infection of individual k. the conditional probability that individual j got infection at day T given the infection times of all other members was f j (excluding the index case) the criterion for recruitment was a positive result for influenza A or B using the QuickVue rapid diagnostic test on a nose and throat swab. we defined acute respiratory infection as follows: at least 2 symptoms out of fever (temperature 37.8 \u00b0C), cough, headache, sore throat, and myalgia (3, 4). we used a nuisance parameter to allow noninfection symptoms onset (5, 6). relationship between hazard and incubation period was as follows: W ( |, ) = ( 1 e x p ( s) e x p ( t 1 s ( t ). if infected individual j had no reported symptoms onset, g j ( T ) reduced to e x p ( 14 t t j I 1 ) e x p ( t j I t t m a x ( s ( T t j I ) + p e x p ( t j I t t m a x). RT-PCR was used for confirmation the sensitivity of the RT-PCR test was correlated to the time since infection and the viral load (10\u201313) the sensitivity of the RT-PCR test was correlated to the time since infection and the viral load. in the symptoms diaries collected, we found incomplete records. the collection of specimens for RT-PCR was not complete. the missing patterns in both data were not regular. about 12% of households had the data truncated, and the mean of the number of days of data truncated was 2 d. the records of RT-PCR test results that were obtained beyond the fixed timeframe determined by the symptoms record were discarded to retain the consistency. the unknown infection times were also sampled. the algorithm sampled different components in the following sequence. move ii and move iv followed random walk Metropolis\u2013Ha. we used noninformative uniform priors for individual parameters with reasonably specified lower and upper bounds. we had U (, + ) for v 2 and v 3 (which allowed negative intervention efficacies). we also had U (, + ) for p and, as they were probabilities. all times of different events were scaled so that the day of intervention was equal to day zero. the joint likelihood for all households is straightforward after specifying the likelihood for a single household. a hazard of infection was determined by a function i n I ( ), [S2] to other susceptible members in the household, where, i ( i = 1,2 ), n, and were the time since infection, the infectiousness parameter (it corresponded to the children when i = 1 and to the adults when i = 2), the household size, and the coefficient that explained the dependency between the infectiousness and household size. the interventions efficacies in our model represented average daily efficacies by aggregating the adherence. denote A ( t) as the total force of infection from other household members to a particular individual j after taking into account the interventions. j reflected the susceptibility of children relative to adults. v i ( i = 1,2,3 ) related to the interventions efficacies. corresponding percentage of reduction of infectiousness was 1 e v i. we defined acute respiratory infection as follows: at least 2 symptoms out of fever (temperature 37.8 \u00b0C), cough, headache, sore throat, and myalgia (3, 4). similar to the event of infection, we assumed that the hazard of having symptoms onset follows a function of time since infection, denoted as s ( ). we assumed a Gamma incubation period distribution with mean 2 d and SD 0.25 d (7). the conversion between the incubation period distribution and hazard function was only valid if the infected case was certain for having symptoms onset, but this was not always the case. the respective probabilities for the case with T t j I and for symptoms onset of noninfected individuals were straightforward to write down by disregarding the contribution of s. RT-PCR was used for confirmation of infection. q j + ( t k p ) = 1 ( i n ( t k p t j ) = 1 ( i n ( t k p t j ) = 1 ( i n ( t k p t j ) = 1 ( t k p t j ) = 1 ( t k p t j ) = 1 ( t k p we assumed that the infectiousness of an infectee varied according to the time since infection. any infected person in the household contributed a hazard of infection, determined by a function i n I ( ), [S2] to other susceptible members in the household, where, i ( i = 1,2 ), n, and were the time since infection. we also allowed a community hazard of infection. it was assumed the infectiousness per day was reduced by a constant proportion equal to the intervention efficacy since the day of intervention applied. j reflected the susceptibility of children relative to adults. v i ( i = 1,2,3 ) related to the interventions efficacies. v 2 and v 3 related to the efficacy for the hand hygiene group. the criterion for recruitment was a positive result for influenza A or B using the QuickVue rapid diagnostic test on a nose and throat swab. it can be safely assumed that the index case was an infectee. the distribution of infection time can be determined from the reported symptoms onset time together with an assumed distribution of the incubation period. hazard function for symptoms onset s ( ) can be computed iteratively starting from = 1. the conversion between the incubation period distribution and hazard function was only valid if the infected case was certain for having symptoms onset, but this was not always the case. if infected individual j had no reported symptoms onset, g j reduced to e x p ( 14 t t j I 1 ) e x p ( t j I t t m a x) + p e x p ( t j I t t m a x). RT-PCR was used for confirmation of infection. sensitivity over the time since infection t, S ( t ) = / 3, for 0 t 2., for 2 t 5. / 3, for 5 t 10. 0, otherwise. q j + ( t k p ) = 1 ( i n ( t k p t j ) = 1 ( i n ( t k p t j ) = 1 ( t k p t j ) in the symptoms diaries collected, we found incomplete records. also, the collection of specimens for RT-PCR was not complete. the missing patterns in both data were not regular. the inference of the parameters in the model was challenging mainly due to the presence of unobserved infection process. the likelihood function depends on the correct distinction between infectee and noninfectee. the sensitivity of RT-PCR is only high at the time of peak infectiousness (10\u201313) move ii was carried out in a manner similar to that in move i. move ii was carried out in a manner similar to that in move i. priors for other model parameters."}
