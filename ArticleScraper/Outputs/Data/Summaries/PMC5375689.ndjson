{"summary": "the most common viral infection acquired by the developing fetus occurs in approximately 0.5 to 1% of live births in the united states. the susceptibility of the developing CNS to CMV infection has been suggested to be a determinant of pathogenic outcomes in humans and animal models. a murine model of congenital HCMV infection in which newborn mice infected peripherally with nonlethal inocula of murine cytomegalovirus develop focal encephalitis. MCMV-infected newborn mice exhibit measurable abnormalities in CNS development that are most readily observed in the cerebellum. a direct antiviral effect of TNF- on CMV replication in primary human astrocytes has been documented in vitro. a direct antiviral effect of TNF- on CMV replication in primary human astrocytes has been documented in vitro. transgenic mice constitutively expressing TNF- in the CNS exhibit severe inflammation and associated histopathological findings. neuronal overexpression of TNF- has been associated with increased cytokine production and lower seizure thresholds in Borna virus-infected rodents. neutralization of TNF- resulted in a significant decrease in activated blood myeloid mononuclear cells (CD45int Ly6Chi CD11b+ CCR2+) that trafficked into the CNS of MCMV-infected newborn mice. treatment of infected mice with TNF-NAb normalized previously described developmental abnormalities in the cerebellum. the increased expression of chemokines associated with mononuclear cell recruitment to the CNS was consistent with previous descriptions of the infiltration of myeloid and lymphoid cells into the CNS. the increased expression of chemokines associated with mononuclear cell recruitment to the CNS was consistent with previous descriptions of the infiltration of myeloid and lymphoid cells into the CNS. the expression of TNF-, as well as IL-1, MCP-1, RANTES, IFN-, IFN-, and STAT1 was decreased in the cerebella of infected mice treated with TNF-NAbs. treatment had little effect on the transcription of IFIT1 or IRF7 in the cerebella of infected mice. median MCMV genome copy numbers (log10) were calculated using a Kruskal-Wallis test. n = 25 to 35 mice/group for liver, spleen, and brain; n = 5 mice/group for cerebellum. genitor cell (GNPC) number were altered in MCMV-infected newborn mice compared to these values in uninfected control mice. treatment with isotype antibodies did not alter the abnormal cerebellar development observed in MCMV-infected mice. vehicle-treated infected mice were significantly different (P 0.05) from control mice. altered cerebellar morphogenesis in infected mice was associated with abnormalities in GNPC proliferation in the EGL of the cerebellar cortex. logical deficits in the cerebella of infected mice also coincided with altered transcription of several developmentally regulated genes within GNPCs. corticosteroid treatment normalized transcription of these genes (26, 29). expression of both GABRA6 and CDK5 was decreased following infection. -target effect was not mediated specifically by TNF-NAbs. transcription of Tiam1 remained unaltered across all experimental treatment groups. neutralizing TNF- in infected mice normalized developmental gene expression in the cerebellum. treatment with TNF-NAbs decreased CNS inflammation and normalized cerebellar development in MCMV-infected newborn mice. this finding suggested that TNF-NAbs could decrease inflammation in the CNS of infected mice by limiting recruitment of peripheral blood monocytes to the brains of MCMV-infected mice. immunofluorescence detection of Iba-1+ (green), CD169+ (red), and Hoechst (blue) cells in the cerebella of vehicle-treated control mice and vehicle-, isotype-, and TNF-NAb-treated infected mice analyzed by confocal microscopy. 4 sections were counted/animal; n = 5 mice/group. monocytes expressed CD11b and the highest levels of Ly6C (nc-Mo) (CD11b+ Ly6Cint) and lymphoid cells, expressing intermediate levels of Ly6C (iMo) (CD11b+ Ly6Chi) (Fig. 6A), and lymphoid cells, expressing either low or nondetectable levels of the myeloid marker CD11b (CD45int/lo) infected mice treated with TNF-NAbs decreased frequency of infiltrating nc-Mo, iMo, and lymphoid subsets. infected mice treated with TNF-NAbs decreased by 54%, 71%, and 60%. each MNC subset identified in the MCMV-infected brain infiltrate was significantly decreased following systemic treatment with TNF-NAb. nc-Mo (CD11b+ Ly6Cint) (C), iMo (CD11b+ Ly6Chi) (D), and lymphoid cells (CD11blow/ Ly6Cint) (E) data shown as means SEM; n = 2 or 3 replicates. 4 mice pooled per replicate, with 4 mice pooled per replicate. MFI values of iMo expressing MHC-II, CD80, and CCR2 did not decrease significantly compared to untreated or IC-treated controls. in this model, TNF-NAb treatment significantly reduced the infiltration of MNCs into the brains of MCMV-infected mice. iMo that infiltrate the brains of MCMV-infected mice remain activated following TNF-NAb treatment. decreased frequencies of nc-Mo, iMo, and lymphoid subsets could be explained by decreased frequencies of these subsets of MNCs in peripheral blood. this could be explained by decreased frequencies of these subsets of MNCs in peripheral blood of uninfected and MCMV-infected mice treated with TNF-NAbs or IC. treatment with the TNF-NAbs resulted in a decrease in the frequency of iMo by more than 50% relative to infected mice and IC-treated mice. this result suggested that TNF-NAbs preferentially impacted the iMo subset within peripheral blood. the frequency of cells that expressed the chemokine receptor CCR2 was then determined. induced inflammation was secondary to TNF-NAb effects on iMo in peripheral blood. treatment decreases the frequency of inflammatory monocytes (CD11b+ Ly6Chi CCR2+) but not that of nonclassical monocytes or lymphocytes in blood of MCMV-infected newborn mice. MCMV infection induced an 7-fold increase in the frequency of MHC-II+ microglial cells (Ly6C CD11b+ CD45low) compared to that in uninfected mice. the proportion of resting microglia decreased in MCMV-infected mice compared to uninfected mice. the cells analyzed were isolated from the brains of uninfected or MCMV-infected mice that were left untreated or treated with the TNF-NAbs. the data represent 2 or 3 replicates per group, with 4 mice pooled/replicate. iMo and microglial cells represented primary sources of proinflammatory TNF-. in iMo subsets sorted from blood, relative expression of TNF- was again highest in iMo. blood- and brain-derived lymphoid cells expressed low levels of TNF-. both brain- and blood-derived lymphoid subsets expressed low levels of IP10 (Fig. 10A and B) both brain- and blood-derived lymphoid subsets expressed low levels of IP10 (Fig. 10A and B) these data raise the possibility that TNF-NAbs could impact CNS inflammation. the induction of proinflammatory responses in the brain peak on PND 8 (26, 29) we initially analyzed the transcription and protein levels of a subset of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines involved in mononuclear cell recruitment. previously described increases in the transcription of the proinflammatory cytokine genes TNF-, interleukin 1 (IL-1) and the chemokine genes MCP-1 and RANTES in the cerebella of PND 8-infected mice medians with interquartile ranges; n = 3 cerebella/sample with 3 replicates/group. the data are shown as means SEM; n = 3 mice/group. treatment of MCMV-infected mice with TNF-NAbs decreases inflammatory responses in the cerebellum. treatment of MCMV-infected newborn mice with TNF-NAbs modulated inflammatory responses in the cerebellum. the cerebellar area, external granule cell layer (EGL thickness) and granule neuron progenitor cell number were altered in MCMV-infected mice following TNF-NAb treatment. treatment with isotype antibodies did not alter the abnormal cerebellar development observed in MCMV-infected mice. 8 sections were analyzed/mouse. n = 3 mice/group for vehicle-treated animals; n = 5 mice/group for isotype- or TNF-NAb-treated animals. control antibodies had no effect on altered proliferation of cerebellar GNPCs. no differences were observed in the percentage of cycling (Ki67+) GNPCs entering S phase (BrdU+) following isotype antibody or TNF-NAb treatment of control mice. the effect was an increase in transcription above what was observed in MCMV-infected mice treated with TNF-NAbs. increased expression of CDK5 in control animals following TNF-NAb treatment was not statistically different than CDK5 expression in control animals treated with isotype control antibody. TNF-NAb treatment of MCMV-infected mice results in decreased CNS infiltration of activated inflammatory monocytes, nonclassical monocytes, and lymphoid cells. treatment of MCMV-infected mice with TNF-NAbs decreased CNS inflammation. NAb significantly decreased the population of Iba-1+ CD169+ cells. but only minimally decreased the total number of Iba-1+ cells in the cerebella of infected mice. this finding suggested that TNF-NAbs could decrease inflammation in the CNS of infected mice by limiting recruitment of peripheral blood monocytes. nonclassical peripheral blood monocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, and subsets of activated lymphocytes were distinguished by gating Ly6C with CD11b. previous studies have reported that Ly6C is not expressed by CNS-resident microglia (67) further analysis of the CD45hi CD11blow/ Ly6cint subset revealed that about 50% of these cells were NKp46+ CD3. the average frequencies of the nc-Mo, iMo, and lymphoid subsets increased 3.6-, 11.5-, and 12.8-fold, respectively. in infected mice treated with TNF-NAbs, infiltrating nc-Mo, iMo, and lympho the gates labeled 1, 2, and 3 in the uninfected (CNTRL) plot identify the nc-Mo and iMo subsets in the upper right quadrant and the lymphoid subset in the lower right quadrant. the numbers next to the gates correspond to representative percentages of each cell subset. the frequencies of iMo expressing CD80 and CCR2 were increased 4.4- and 3.4-fold, respectively, compared to the frequencies of iMo expressing these markers in uninfected mice. the average median fluorescence intensity (MFI) values of MHC-II, CD80, and CCR2 were also increased over the average MFI values in cells from uninfected animals. the graphed data represent 2 or 3 replicates per group, with 4 mice pooled/replicate. decreased frequencies of nc-Mo, iMo, and lymphoid subsets could be explained by decreased frequencies of these subsets of MNCs in peripheral blood. the frequencies of nc-Mo, lymphoid cells, and iMo all increased significantly. MCMV-induced activation of the myeloid and lymphoid components of the immune response in infected newborn mice. treatment with the TNF-NAbs resulted in a decrease in the frequency of iMo by more than 50% relative to infected untreated mice and IC-treated mice. in mice treated with IC, we observed a minimal but significant decrease in the frequency of this subset compared to untreated mice. these data indicated that treatment with TNF-NAbs preferentially decreased the frequency of iMo in the peripheral blood of MCMV-infected mice. this suggests that the reduced recruitment of iMo into the brain was secondary to TNF-NAb effects on iMo in peripheral blood. the P values were calculated using two-way ANOVA, with Bonferroni posttests. Neutralization of TNF- correlates with decreased frequency of activated microglia in the brains of MCMV-infected neonatal mice. the activation of microglia has also been linked to increased CNS pathology in neurodegenerative, autoimmune, and infectious diseases. iMo expresses the highest levels of TNF- among all MNC subsets isolated from brain and blood of MCMV-infected mice. we then determined which specific MNC subset isolated from the brains or blood of PND 8 MCMV-infected mice expressed TNF-. mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) directed against cells expressing membrane-bound TNF- (78, 79) MNC isolates from brain or blood were sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) according to their expression of CD45, CD11b, and Ly6C, and the expression of TNF- RNA was quantified. the microglial subset expressed IP10, consistent with the function of activated microglia in the recruitment of effector leukocytes. the level of expression of IFN- in nc-Mo was modest in comparison to the level detected in lymphocytes present in the brain. both brain- and blood-derived lymphoid subsets expressed low levels of IP10. a murine model of congenital HCMV infection was developed using peripheral (intraperitoneal) inoculation of newborn mice with nonlethal doses of MCMV. the model recapitulates the hematogenous route of CNS infection following intrauterine HCMV infection of the human fetus. inflammatory mediators in the cerebellum and the frequency of CD45+ CD11b+ mononuclear cells in the brains of infected mice. these results argued that virus-induced inflammatory responses, and not direct viral cytopathology, were responsible for the developmental abnormalities in the CNS observed in infected mice. MCMV-infected mice were dependent on CCR2/CCL2 monocytosis in peripheral blood and not secondary to CCR2/CCL2-driven recruitment of iMo to the infected brain (73, 86). it is also of interest that MCMV infection of adult mice results in myd88-dependent mobilization and activation of monocytes in the bone marrow and decreased blood and brain iMo. the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes from the blood to tissue has been shown to be independent of CCR2 expression by iMo. the depletion of blood iMo by TNF-NAb treatment appears to be the most likely mechanism for the decrease of iMo in the brains of MCMV-infected mice. however, some of the decrease was secondary to the decrease in proinflammatory resident cells of the brain, including microglia. proinflammatory monocytes infiltrating the CNS have been defined by the expression of CCR2 and Ly6C, and in some cases together with activation markers (67, 96) these markers define M1 monocytes, thought to have a major role in the early response to tissue injury/infection and associated with immunopathology (96). iMo play a critical role in resistance to lethal encephalitis in this model. decreased infiltration of iMo into the brain limited neurodevelopmental abnormalities in MCMV-infected mice. differences include nature of the encephalitis induced by the two viruses; developmental status of the infected animal; and limited neurotropism of MCMV compared to WNV. NK cells have been proposed to provide protective antiviral activities in models of viral encephalitis, including coronavirus encephalitis. the precise role of NK cells in WNV encephalitis remains less well understood. however, it is important to note that NK cell function in neonatal mice is developmentally immature and cannot be compared to results from studies in adult mice. a major effect of TNF-NAb treatment was the decreased infiltration of activated Ly6Chi CCR2+ iMo into the brains of infected mice secondary to the loss of iMo from the peripheral blood. interventions modulating the trafficking of iMo from the peripheral blood into the CNS could offer a therapeutic approach for prevention of neurologic sequelae characteristic of this intrauterine infection. sterile 1 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was delivered by intraperitoneal injection of newborn mice no more than 12 h following birth. pups were treated by i.p. injection with neutralizing rat monoclonal antibodies to TNF-. phosphatase inhibitor cocktail with EDTA was sonicated 3 times for 10 s each time. samples were then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. after centrifugation, the samples were aliquoted and stored at 80\u00b0C. sections were washed 3 times for 5 min/wash with 1 PBS, 0.01% Triton X-100 and then incubated with Hoescht stain (in 1 PBS) for 2 h at RT. sections were then washed 5 times for 5 min/wash with 1 PBS, 0.01% Triton X-100 and then incubated with 4% PFA for 15 min at RT. goat anti-rabbit tetramethyl rhodamine isocyanate (TRITC)/fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and goat anti-rat TRITC/FITC (1:150; Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL) the secondary antibodies used were goat anti-rabbit tetramethyl rhodamine isocyanate (FITC) the liver was collected from each animal, as well as a small piece of spleen, brain, and cerebellum (50 mg) randomly collected for the analysis of viral genome copies by quantitative PCR (qPCR) the results were expressed as log genome copies per milligram of tissue. the cells were pelleted, resuspended in the appropriate staining cocktail. they were incubated for another 20 min at 4\u00b0C, with the fixable viability dye eFluor 450 (eBiosiences, San Jose, CA) to allow LIVE/DEAD cell discrimination. a two-tailed t test was used to determine statistical significance across treatment groups. two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferronni's posttest, was used to determine significance across treatment groups. mice were infected with 500 PFU of MCMV Smith (ATCC VR-1399) in 50 l of sterile 1 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) antibodies received a vehicle injection of sterile 1 PBS alone. on PND 8, between 16 and 18 h post-final treatment, the mice were sacrificed and perfused with ice-cold PBS. organs were prepared for the appropriate assay. mice were perfused with PBS, and their brains were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) overnight, cryoprotected in 30% sucrose-PBS, and embedded in Tissue Tek OCT compound. the sections were blocked for 1 h at RT, followed by a 2 N HCl acid wash. the following day, the sections were washed and incubated in secondary antibody overnight at RT. sections were washed 5 times for 5 min/wash with 1 PBS, 0.01% Triton X-100. sections were postfixed with 4% PFA for 15 min at RT. primary antibodies used were goat anti-rabbit tetramethyl rhodamine isocyanate (TRITC) and goat anti-rat TRITC/FITC. the invitrogen superscript III First Strand synthesis kit was used to synthesize cDNA. real-time reverse transcription-PCR was performed according to previous protocol. the liver was collected from each animal, as well as a small piece of spleen, brain, and cerebellum randomly collected for the analysis. cell suspensions were cleared through 40-m (blood) or 70-m (brain) strainers. cell suspensions were cleared at 600 g for 30 min over a 30%-70% discontinuous Percoll gradient for blood or 690 g for 20 min over a 37.5% continuous Percoll gradient for brain. cell suspensions were pelleted, resuspended in appropriate staining cocktail. sorted cells were collected in RPMI (10% fetal bovine serum [FBS]) before being lysed in GTC RNA lysis buffer (Omega Bio-tek, Norcross, GA) different antibodies, isotype controls, and corresponding fluorochromes used in this work were as follows: FITC-anti-CD80 (clone 16-10A1; eBiosciences), FITC-anti-CD45 (clone 30-F11; e a two-tailed t test was used to determine statistical significance. two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferronni's posttest was used to determine significance across treatment groups."}
