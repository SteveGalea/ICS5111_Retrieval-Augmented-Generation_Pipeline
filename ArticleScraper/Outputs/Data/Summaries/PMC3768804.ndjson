{"summary": "HRVs were discovered in 1956 (16) and are now classified as members of the Enterovirus genus (22) in the Picornaviridae family. these viruses share many common features, including a non-enveloped icosahedral capsid, a sense RNA genome and partial nucleotide and amino acid sequence identity (19). PCR protocols that detect rhinovirus amplify a fragment of the 5' UTR (Untraslated region) of the viral genome two different protocols for rhinovirus detection were applied to samples from nasal washes from 291 adults 18 or older who presented with acute respiratory infection. samples were also collected from adults who were categorized as healthcare workers, members of the general population seen in the emergency room, and renal transplant outpatients. 291 samples were tested with the first RT-PCR/hybridization protocol. those samples which did not hybridize with enterovirus were considered positive for rhinovirus. 95 were classified as rhinovirus, while 9 were classified as enterovirus. analysis of results obtained after first two strategies revealed 83% concordance involving 60 positive results. seven samples were not tested using the duplex semi-nested-RT-PCR protocol. an enterovirus-positive sample in RT-PCR/Hybridization was negative for rhinovirus and positive in RT-PCR/sequencing. the concern about the viral agent causing individual respiratory infections has led researchers to seek new conventional PCR-based strategies to distinguish these viruses. in this context, we tested three different protocols, including one that differentiated HRV form HEV by nested-PCR (2). the picornavirus RT-PCR and hybridization protocol had a higher detection ability compared with the RT-PCR/sequencing protocol, but 28 picornavirus/rhinovirus positive-samples were exclusively detected by the duplex semi-nested-RT-PCR protocol lacks specificity for discrimination between rhinovirus and enterovirus. this may be due to the genetic similarity between these members of the Enterovirus genus. some authors have suggested that inclusion of capsid coding sequences (21) in the PCR target region may slightly decrease an assay's screening sensitivity."}
