{"summary": "EVD spreads through body fluids, with high infectivity and mortality. up to November 26, 2014, about 15935 infections along with 5689 death cases have been reported. the battle against EVD is ongoing and many governments have made emergency plans. domestic scholars have also predicted the outbreak of Ebola in china by analytic method. however, they always neglect the actual interaction conditions among individuals. hazard affected bodies are just the components of artificial society, while emergencies and interventions are the cores of scenario-response theory. basic schedules of student specify the location, duration, and probability of each activity. p i in the table means the action probability in the relevant period. the detailed generation process of artificial Beijing has been discussed in literature. residential buildings are viewed as the main areas of Ebola propagation because of high contact frequency among families. restaurants provide the places to establish the temporary group with weak links [6], where EVD spreads by noncontact infections. it is priority for an individual to take an activity in the memory and choose the predesigned location. most of activities will especially be replanned under emergency situation. an individual just needs to choose another location for activities in case that the current location in the memory is unreachable. the heuristics of machine learning are listed as follows: (H1): if l(k) R L, then rank t 1 t 2 t m; (H2): if l N = l n, then remove l(k) from R L; (H4): if (l(k) R L)(l(k) is full or l\u2032(k) is closed, then l\u2032(k) will be removed from R L and the behavior schedules are designed based on history operation and current situation. dynamic schedules are able to simulate their behaviors in emergency management. hazard affected bodies are just the components of artificial society. the detailed generation process of artificial Beijing has been discussed in literature [13], contributed by another member of our team. the detailed generation process of artificial Beijing has been discussed in literature [13], contributed by another member of our team. 2.2. Optimization on Individuals' Behaviors Based on Machine Learning. some problems are exposed in artificial Beijing. a large scale individual-based simulation brings amazing overhead in computing. a location is considered feasible if the following condition is met. in our study, l N is the maximum volume of l, and l n is the current volume. the algorithm starts from (H1) if l\u2032(k) is full or l\u2032(k) is closed, then l\u2032(k) will be removed from R L and the algorithm returns to (H1). if l\u2032(k) is full, then l\u2032(k) will be removed from R L. behavior schedules are designed based on history operation and current situation. dynamic schedules are able to simulate their behaviors in emergency management. an individual will keep far away from the epidemic areas if epidemic outbreaks. 0 is always defined as the expected number of secondary infectious cases generated by an average infectious case in an entirely susceptible population [17]. k is the contact times for each infected individual in unit time, b is the infection probability for per contact between infected and susceptible individuals, and D is the mean duration of infection. contact propagation spreads EVD by contacts between infected and susceptible ones. EVD may survive several hours outside the bodies, and one may suffer from the virus according to polluted materials used by patients. x A I P 1 = x 1 1 y, y 0,1, x A I P 2 = x 2 1 y, y 0,1, (6). x AIP1 is the actual infection probability of contact infection. x AIP2 is the actual infection probability of noncontact infection. k is the contact times for each infected individual in unit time. b is the infection probability for per contact between infected and susceptible individuals. the mean duration of infection must be maintained below 1 by interventions. EVD may survive several hours outside the bodies, and one may suffer from the virus according to polluted materials used by patients. the noncontact infection probability (NCIP) is relevant to CIP, and it decreases along with time (t) elapsing. x A I P 1 = x 1 1 y, y 0,1, x A I P 2 = x 2 1 y, y 0,1, (6) where x AIP1 is the actual infection probability of contact infection, while x AIP2 is the actual infection probability of noncontact infection. the interaction experiment refers to millions of individuals. it will take 1.5 hours to simulate the whole process. each sample will run 10 times and calculate the average R 0. The detailed parameters are listed in Table 4. The verification of infection probability. the infections emerge exponentially in the 150th day. the infection cases will reach 10 thousands in the 180th day. the infection cases will reach 68391 in the 240th day, and new cases are about one hundred per day. residential buildings are the main places for propagation, which take the proportion of 51%. noncontact infection cases take the proportion of 4%, which mainly takes place in restaurants or hospitals. the proportion of different propagation generations are also shown in Figure 6(d) the interaction experiment refers to millions of individuals. it will take 1.5 hours to simulate the whole process. each sample will run 10 times and calculate the average R 0. The detailed parameters are listed in Table 4. The verification of infection probability. the infections emerge exponentially in the 150th day. the infection cases will reach 10 thousands in the 180th day, and new cases are about one hundred per day. the result is gained in the absence of interventions. noncontact infection cases take the proportion of 4%, which mainly takes place in restaurants or hospitals. the proportions of different propagation generations are also shown in Figure 6(d). sensitivity experiments are presented to analyze the validity of interventions against Ebola. high ratio of seeing a doctor always leads to low infection cases. if RSD reaches 0.9, the infection cases are less than 20 during 100 days. if the ratio is 0.5, the number will increase to 70 if the ratio is 0.5. assume that TSD is the 2nd day, RSD is 0.7, and the differences are the ISR of potential infected individuals. the infection cases are 43 when ISR is 0.5, while the total infections have decreased to 26 if ISR is 0.9. noncontact infections are viewed as the main manner because cross infection through dinnerware is serious. the infectivity of environment is determined by virus dose and vitality. disinfection can decrease the virus dose and reduce the virus vitality at the same time. the ratio of seeing a doctor is able to affect the whole infections directly. once an exposed patient contacts with other individuals, it is possible to spread EVD at the same time. the polluted materials also have infectivity since EDV is able to survive for several hours outside the host. patients are always sent to hospital in the 2nd day because they do not pay enough attention to the symptoms originally. indirect contact and direct contact are two ways of infecting Ebola. however, it is also necessary to isolate potential infected individuals who have contacted diagnose patients. the infection cases have almost reduced half if IMR is 30%. the cost of vaccines is always expensive and the amount is always limited. it needs to inoculate the focus groups accurately such as medical workers. the infected cases of MW are about 10 if SP is 0.8. the number has increased to 30 if SP is 0.2. the infected cases of MW are about 10 if SP is 0.8. level 4 15 4 0.5 0 0 0 0 Level 3 10 3 0.5 0 0 0.2 0 Level 2 7 2 0.7 0.7 0.1 0.5 0 0.2 0 Level 1 3 1 0.9 0.9 0.3 0.8 0.8 Once taking the strongest interventions at level 1, new infection cases will decrease in a short time. interventions are designed according to the emergency response plans. the simulation result is coincident with the conclusions of corresponding researches. the goal of interventions is to reduce R 0 from the current value to below 1. response level LT (day) TSD (day) RSD (%) ISR (%) SP (%) DD (%) Level 4 15 4 0.5 0 0 0 Level 3 10 3 0.5 0 0.2 0 Level 2 7 2 0.7 0.7 0.1 0.5 0 0.2 0 Level 1 3 1 0.9 0.9 0.3 0.8 0.8 0.8 Once taking the strongest interventions at level 1 will decrease in a short time. artificial Beijing has been verified in case of H1N1 influenza. NSFC has yet revised the model. interventions are designed according to emergency response plans. study proposes a new method to study the disease propagation based on virtual city. based on demographics, some agent-based systems are always built based on simple rules. artificial Beijing needs to be validated constantly. following aspects of virtual city also need to be improved and optimized. error inevitably exists in predicting epidemic spreading in Beijing. the propagation process of EVD and its corresponding interventions are simulated based on artificial Beijing. in this paper, the propagation process of EVD and its corresponding interventions are simulated based on artificial Beijing. artificial society is a dynamic and involving virtual system, which would provide basic environment for kinds of complex experiments in social, economic, and military fields. on the other hand, it allows users to expand the attributes of existing entities to satisfy the requirement of experiments. for example, it is necessary to cultivate the traveling mode of individuals to study personal evacuation under emergency situation. sensitivity experiments are taken to analyze the role of key factors in interventions. the authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding publication of this paper."}
