{"summary": "the pandemic was managed using a top-down style that left many involved players with critical views and frustrations. we aimed to describe physicians' perceptions in regards to issues encountered with the pandemics management at the physician level and highlight suggested improvements for future healthcare emergencies. in the province of Quebec, the vast majority of practicing physicians are members of their respective disciplinary association [9]. there is scant literature about physicians' perceptions about healthcare system's management of pH1N1 [13,14]. a web-based questionnaire was drafted by the provincial, regional, and local levels. items on the questionnaire reflected the authors' medical-specialty expert knowledge of the guidelines. the final questionnaire was reviewed with members of each association's CME Committee. thematic content analysis was used to summarize responses to multiple-choice questions. open coding was used to break down free text into small units (meaning units) the data was then reorganized using these codes as the unit of analysis. these categories were then reviewed and reworked using team consensus. survey tool Two authors drafted a web-based questionnaire to document physicians' perceptions on the pH1N1 response. items on the questionnaire reflected the authors' medical-specialty expert knowledge of the guidelines. the final questionnaire was reviewed with members of each association's CME Committee. analysis data was analysed to describe and understand critical issues. thematic content analysis was used to summarize responses to multiple-choice questions. thematic content analysis was used for qualitative data. results Response rates and respondents' practice profile 42 percent (134/317) of eligible physicians completed the survey. five respondents were excluded, as they did not indicate their specialty. practice profiles of the remaining 129 respondents are described in Table 1. PHPMS involved in pH1N1 management were more likely to practice in the field of infectious disease (48.7% vs. 31.7%) and in a regional public health team (87.2% vs. 75.0%) than those who were not. other practice characteristics were similar for both subgroups. 22 (55%) experts 12 (19.4%) 9 (22.5%) Case reporting 12 (19.4%) 7 (17.5%) Epidemiological investigations 9 (14.5%) 10 (25.0%) Neuraminidase inhibitors prescriptions 17 (27.4%) 5 (12.5%) Other 2 (3.2%) 8 (20.0%) Crisis management Overall 28 (45.2%) 24 (60%) Top-down 23 (37.1%) 22 (55.0%) open codes associated with coordination (n = 180) were more frequent than those relating to resources (n = 64) the following sections report the results for each of the two core themes and their subthemes. representatives verbatim quotations of the subthemes are provided in Table 3. \"It is frustrating to not be remunerated for the overwhelming number of calls answered\" \"there needs to be a better distinction between hierarchical roles and expert roles\" \"Lack of information in the beginning, late access to pertinent epidemiological data\" a slow communication process, an overwhelming number of communication sources, and divergent messages were identified as the main problems. participants suggested improvements to communication management such as greater centralization and use of the Internet instead of teleconferences. ents were concerned with lack of communication between physicians in the field and expert advisory committees. they also questioned the credentials of committees' members and their decisions. concerns included increasing speed of dissemination of advisory committees decisions and provision of committee members credentials. medical microbiologists and of public health and preventive medicine IDMM PHPMS All respondents N = 68 Respondents involved in the 2009 pH1N1 N = 62 All respondents N = 61 Respondents involved in the 2009 pH1N1 N = 40 Practice Field Infectious Diseases 65 (97.0%) 59 (96.7%) 19 (31.7%) 19 (48.7%) Other 2 (3.0%) 2 (3.3%) 41 (68.3%) 20 (51.3%) Practice Setting Clinical Setting 49 (72.1%) 47 ( PHPMS reported problems mainly with the decision-making process in the prioritization and vaccination of high-risk groups. more than 50% reported issues with the top-down management process, communication processes (CPGs' dissemination and communication routes), and patient management at the public health level. 4 (10.0%) Other 1 (1.6%) 2 (5.0%) Communication process Overall 34 (54.8%) 24 (60%) Clinical practice guidelines (content) 19 (30.6%) 11 (27.5%) Dissemination of clinical practice guidelines 26 (41.9%) 13 (32.5%) Communication routes 25 (40.3%) 12 (30.0%) Other 2 (3.2%) 2 (5.0%) Vaccination Overall 35 (56.4%) 25 (62.5%) Availability of vaccine 21 (33.9%) 10 (25.0%) Groups at risk 18 (29.0%) 17 (42.5 infectious diseases specialist/medical microbiologists and public health and preventive medicine specialists were involved in the management of the 2009 A (H1N1) pandemic. 62 specialist physicians* were involved in the management of the 2009 A (H1N1) pandemic. \"there needs to be a better distinction between hierarchical roles and expert roles\" \"Lack of information in the beginning, late access to pertinent epidemiological data\" \"Difficulty with decisions and conclusions of the committees and treatment recommendations\" \"The number of lab technologists available is insufficient,\" \"allow diagnostic PCR analysis at the local level\" physicians expressed unhappiness with top-down management model and speed of decision-making. physicians also found lack of autonomy and transparency in decision-making. many patients with influenza-like symptoms were sent to emergency rooms without prior evaluation, resulting in overburdened emergency rooms. some also mentioned a lack of hospital single rooms to accommodate patients with pH1N1 as well as difficulty in transferring patients. a need for increased use of newer communication technologies had been advocated for effective use of CME during outbreaks. there may have been a lack of communication about the managerial approach that would be implemented. a bottom-up method of feedback is also needed to allow adaptation to varying circumstances. results emphasize the need to improve transparency and build stronger working relationships between physicians and health authorities. studies based on other qualitative research approaches are needed to further understand how healthcare systems can improve the implementation of emergency response plans.
