{"summary": "the incidence of birth defects in perinatal infants from 200l to 2008 was 120.0 per 10,000 births. the incidence in the first 4 years (2005\u20132008) was much higher than the latter four (2001\u20132004) the prevalence of birth defects was slightly higher among mothers over 35 years old than those under 35 years old. BDs were included in the system according to the international classification of diseases clinical modification codes, tenth edition (i.e., ICD-10). perinatal infants pertained to all cases (livebirths, fetal deaths, or stillbirths after 28 weeks of gestation and termination of pregnancy for fetal anomaly. the prevalence was slightly higher among mothers over 35 years old than those under 35 years old, but with no significance (2=1.98, P >0.05) the top six BDs and prevalence were cleft lip and/or palate (CLP, without cleft palate) and polydactyly during 2001\u20132008. the prevalence of CHD was rising from top nine in 2001 to top three in 2008, as 0.27 to 1.28. but the prevalence of NTDs was decreased sharply in 2008. BD prevalence in different infants\u2019 groups we. the difference of prevalence between urban and rural was of no significance (2=0.03, P >0.05), but that between male and female was significant (2=5.24, P 0.05) the prevalence was slightly higher among mothers over 35 years old than those under 35 years old, but with no significance (2=1.98, P >0.05) hydrocephaly, external ear malformation (EEM) and neural tube defects (NTDs, including anencephalia, rachischisis and encephalocele) followed the top six BDs in 2008. prevalence of CHD was rising from top nine in 2001 to top three in 2008, as 0.27 to 1.28. two surveillance hospitals were included in 2001 and the number of infants under surveillance was nearly 40,000 each year. BD prevalence was 12 (4,874 of 406,264), far exceeding the previous prevalence (8) during 1997\u20132002 (1). genital abnormalities have been linked to maternal hypoxia. e.g. maternal smoking (7\u20139), maternal alcohol abuse or some forms of maternal hypertension treatment (10) integration of genetic and environmental risk using different methods may generate a synthesis that will better characterize etiologies, as well as provide access to better clinical care and prevention (11) studies on the integration of genetic and environmental risks are also important for better characterizing etiologies. eight years\u2019 BD data indicate that the BD prevalence was rising and the BD prevalence in Hubei province should be valued. prevention program of BD shall be better performed to decrease prevalence of birth deformation in perinatal infants based on improved perinatal care and prenatal diagnosis."}
