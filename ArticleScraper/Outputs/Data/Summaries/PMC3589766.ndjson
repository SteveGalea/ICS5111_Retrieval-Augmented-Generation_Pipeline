{"summary": "Bunyamwera virus (BunV) is an enveloped virus with a negative-sense RNA genome (12 kb) divided between three segments. in infected mammalian cells, BunV infection leads to formation of tubular structures (up to 50 per cell). tubes are in close contact with mitochondria and rough endoplasmic reticulum. nidoviruses are enveloped viruses with positive-sense RNA genomes of 13\u201316 kb (arteriviruses) and 30 kb (coronaviruses) the replication-associated proteins are encoded in overlapping 5\u2032-open reading frames (ORFs) 1a and 1b. coronavirus nsp3, nsp4, and nsp6 encompass transmembrane domains. picornaviruses induce heterogeneous (50\u2013500 nm) DMVs of the ER, Golgi and lysosomal origin. some commonality of the picornavirus and coronavirus ultrastructures has been noted. 1a binds to perinuclear ER membranes via an amphipathic helix. each mature vesicle retains a thin neck (8 nm) to cytosol. other alpha-like viruses induce morphologically similar ultrastructures. RNA-1 encodes protein A, a multifunctional RNA replicase. replicase molecules attach to the outer mitochondrial membrane and cause its invaginations. the interior of the vesicles is lined by 100 copies of replicase. the intracellular transport of viral particles and replication complexes is rather an active process than mere diffusion. cytosol is a highly viscous matter where translocation of molecules or complexes exceeding a 500-kDa limit is impeded. there is emerging evidence that the replication complexes and associated membranous ultrastructures of (+)RNA viruses are transported along the cytoskeleton. interaction of two replication proteins, NS3 (RNA HEL \u2013 serine proteinase) and NS5A (phosphoprotein), provides for binding and movement of the replication complex along microtubules and actin filaments. there is a significant overlap in the function and regulation of microtubule and actin networks in animal and plant systems. diverse (+)RNA viruses of plants may use cytoskeleton for intracellular trafficking of replication complexes to plasmodesmata. the beet yellows closterovirus (BYV) 15.5-kb genome encodes the replication-associated proteins in 5\u2032-proximal ORFs 1a and 1b. the autocatalytic cleavage of BYV polyproteins by the PCP at Gly588/Gly589 releases the 66-kDa leader protein (Zinovkin et al., 2003) the 1a and 1ab polyproteins are further processed by a yet unknown proteolytic activity(-ies) into at least three fragments. the 63-kDa MTR-containing and 100-kDa HEL-containing proteins were identified in in closteroviruses induce the formation of 100-nm DMVs and multivesicular complexes. these ultrastructures broadly resemble the DMVs and VPs produced by nidoviruses and flaviviruses. membranes in closterovirus DMVs and VPs are likely to be derived from ER or mitochondria. several hydrophobic stretches longer than 20 aa forming putative alpha helixes. two segments of the 1a CR predicted to form separate hydrophobic domains. the GFP:CR-1 produced aggregates of heterogeneous shape and size. yellows virus (genus Crinivirus of the Closteroviridae) rearrangement of perinuclear ER in N. tabacum protoplasts inoculated with LIYV RNA1 transcripts. proteins were expressed by agroinfiltration and visualized at 48 h post infiltration by confocal laser scanning microscopy. phenotypes induced by the BYV CR-2 segment may reflect the formation of closterovirus replication-associated ultrastructures. it is possible that the build-up of closterovirus replication platforms depends on the ER membranes and isaccompanied by essential changes in perinuclear ER."}
