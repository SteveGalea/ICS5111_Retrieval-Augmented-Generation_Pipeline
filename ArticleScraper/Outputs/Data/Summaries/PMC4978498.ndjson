{"summary": "many inhaled microbes cause lethal infections if not contained by the lung immune system. ALI causes increased edema, alveolar permeability, and impaired oxygen exchange. in severe cases, ALI can result in impaired gas exchange function and ultimately death. 6 KO mice also had reduced IL-1-mediated lung injury in a model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. patients with SARS and MERS-CoV were found to have increased infiltration of inflammatory macrophages, accumulation of debris in the lung, and diffuse alveolar damage. 6-deficient mice were protected from influenza virus-induced disease. epithelial 6 controls the homeostatic lung interferon response. this protective phenotype was reversed by exogenous TGF-1 or elimination of the type I interferon receptor. the dose of CA/09 virus used (104 TCID50) was lethal to all WT mice. 70% 6 KO mice survived the infection (p = 0.0090) p 0.0001 by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test (B) or p 0.01 by log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. data represents a single experiment with n = 5 mice per group. data is pooled from 3 independent experiments with n = 3\u20135 mice per group. 6 KO mice with a secondary bacterial challenge model were inoculated intranasally with a sublethal dose of A/Puerto Rico/8/34 H1N1 influenza virus. survival of mice after secondary challenge was 30%, while 6 KO mice were significantly protected (p = 0.0226) with 70% survival. edema accompanied by increased total protein (p 0.0001, Fig 2D) and albumin in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) overall, 6 KO had decreased inflammation, acute lung injury, and improved survival during influenza infection. lack of 6 correlate with improved lung permeability during influenza virus infection. at 8 dpi, mice were injected with 20 mg/kg Evans blue dye 2 h before sacrifice. data were normalized to the dry weight of the lung tissue. most likely mechanism of protection in influenza infected 6 KO mice was decreased viral titers. viral spread in KO lungs was limited compared to WT mice. increased survival in 6 KO mice is independent of overall viral titers. increased survival in 6 KO mice is independent of overall viral titers. s and alveolar type II pneumocytes restricted to peribronchiolar alveoli. 2 = Multifocal virus antigen positive bronchioles, often with less than half epithelial cells infected. majority of cells in bronchioles are antigen-positive. incoming activated bone marrow-derived inflammatory monocytes express CD11b. this provides a means to distinguish between resident AM, inflammatory bone marrow-derived monocytes and DCs. the majority of the 6 KO AM were MerTK+, CD64+, CD11c+, and uniformly CD11b+. numbers of tipDCs (A, F), neutrophils (B, G), CD4+ T cells (C, H), CD8+ T cells (D, I) and PB1-tetramer+ CD8+ T cells (E, J) quantified. data pooled from 2 independent experiments, n = 3\u20135 mice per group. nic progenitors created mice where the blood monocyte pool was severely depleted by loss of the chemokine receptor CCR2. loss of an epithelial integrin alters the phenotype of lung AMs. loss of an epithelial integrin alters the phenotype of lung AMs. uninfected WT (littermate controls) or 6 KO mice were inoculated intratracheally with alveolar macrophages isolated from WT mice. CD45.1 or CD45.2 markers identified donors and recipients. at 7 days post-transfer, animals were sacrificed and alveolar macrophages were analyzed. 6 KO mice treated with TGF-1 had increased numbers of CD11c+CD11b- macrophages. the loss of 6-mediated TGF-1activation is important for both protection and protection from influenza infection. 6 KO mice have increased Type I IFN signaling 6 KO mice had an altered lung environment resulting in decreased viral spread. we used phosphorylated STAT1 levels (pSTAT1) as a marker for type I IFN signaling. sections from 6 KO and 6 KO YFP reporter mice showed increased YFP+ cells scattered throughout the lung. further delineation of the exact cell types in this system expressing YFP is precluded by the strong autofluorescence in the FITC channel in lung macrophages. RNA was isolated from macrophage populations described in (E) and expression of interferon-related transcripts Irf7, Ifit1 and Oas1g determined by quantitative real-time PCR. p 0.001 by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test.
