{"summary": "a viral agent in a host is a complex process which consists of a number of interactions, most of them related to the coevolution of pathogen and host. the virus may then spread widely through non previously adapted, and therefore immunologically nave host populations. Upon transmission to a new host species, viruses must usually adapt to a new genetic and immunologic environment. influenza haemagglutinin binds to sialic acid linked to galactose on the surface of the targeted cell. a number of amino acid substitutions have been produced in influenza haemagglutinin to adjust to the different receptors. protein in the viral replication complex (PA, PB1, PB2 and NP) has also been implicated in restricting replication and intra-host spread in mammals. canine parvovirus (CPV) emerged in 1978 as the cause of new enteric and myocardial diseases in dogs. all CPV isolates obtained so far, termed CPV type 2a, descended from a single ancestor closely related to the feline panleukopenia virus. CPV type 2a contained five substitutions in the capsid sequence compared to CPV type 2. iridoviruses are large double stranded DNA viruses with an icosahedral capsid ranging from 120 to 350 nm in diameter. iridoviruses have been linked to disease in frogs, salamanders and other amphibians, reptiles. es have been shown to be more closely related to frog virus 3, the type species of the genus Ranavirus, than to Lymphocystivirus. members of the genus Ranavirus infect vertebrates of three different taxonomic classes: amphibians, reptiles and fish. ranaviruses have caused epizooties in other fish species: sheatfish and catfish in Europe [38], largemouth bass [39] and ornamental fish (importe grouper iridovirus (SGIV), a tentative species, is the most divergent member of the genus. the MCP genes of these two viruses show approximately 80% and 70% sequence identity, respectively, with the MCP genes of the 5 other ranavirus species. us iridovirus 1 Eur. common frog Giant toad UK Venezuela and Australia Redwood Park virus Red-legged frog tadpole USA Stickleback virus 2 and Tadpole edema virus Common frog, Green frog, red-leg frog France, North America Tiger frog virus (TFV) Tiger frog Thailand, China Tortoise virus 5 Tortoise USA Santee Cooper ranavirus (SRCV), Large tiger frog (Rana tigrina); pig frog (Rana grylio); spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum); green frog (Rana pipiens); European common frog (Rana temporaria); red-legged frog (Rana aurora); common frog (Rana temporaria); edible frog (Pelophylax esc a case of interspecies transmission was demonstrated by Cunningham et al. [59] who infected common frogs Rana temporaria with two ranavirus isolates obtained from diseased toads. a very interesting case of cross-class infection was found studying ATV infection of salamanders. authors performed a dot plot comparison of the genome with that of other ranaviruses previously sequenced. the results indicated that EHNV is more closely related to the amphibian ranaviruses than to the GIV-like viruses infecting fish. authors postulate that there must have been at least three species jumps, from fish to frogs, from fish to salamanders and from frogs to reptiles. a model of FV3/FV3-like virus transmission in aquatic amphibian communities postulates that transmission occurs between anuran (i.e. frogs) and urodele (i.e. salamanders) species. some evidence that salamander ranavirus isolates are also isolated from or detected in laboratory-infected frogs. sper moseri, hippoglossus hippoglossus, Paralichthys olivaceus, Scophthalmus maximus. the affected fish species and geographical ranges of clinical VNN described so far are provided in Table 2. grouper E. coioides [172] Philippines Blackspotted grouper E. malabaricus [168,173] Thailand dusky grouper E. marginatus [73] Mediterranean Kelp grouper E. moara [174] Japan Sevenband grouper E. septemfasciatus [175,176] Japan, Korea Greasy grouper E. tauvina [73,177] Malaysia, Phillipines, Singapore Humpback grouper Chromileptes altivelis [ betanodaviruses are small (25-30 nm), nonenveloped, icosahedral RNA viruses. the genome consists of two single stranded, positive-sense molecules. a subgenomic RNA3 is synthesised during RNA replication from the 3' terminus of RNA1. RGNNV (red grouper nervous necrosis virus) and BFNNV (barfin flounder nervous necrosis virus), using a partial sequence of RNA2, the T4 region, which is a highly variable region of around 400 nt [77,78] these types exhibit different capabilities for infecting fish species. this type shows the broadest host range and causes disease in a variety of warm-water fish species. truding domains of the capsid protein are involved in host specificity. changes observed in the SJNNV capsid seem to have allowed it to efficiently infect and spread within two new hosts, causing epizootic outbreaks in Senegalese sole and gilthead sea bream. other authors have also reported the existence of reassortants among betanodavirus isolates obtained from symptomatic sea bass. novirhabdovirus is one of the six established genera within the family Rhabdoviridae. two of the four recognised species of the genus are infectious haematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV), viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) the origin of the M genogroup may have involved a host shift of the U genogroup IHNV from sockeye salmon to rainbow trout during the 1970s, followed by a relatively rapid evolution and divergence in rainbow trout [94,95]. if this hypothesis is true, it would be interesting to know the mechanisms involved in the adaptation of the virus to the new host. different studies have identified the existence of four genotypes of VHSV. a genotype I group isolates from continental Europe are pathogenic for rainbow trout. a number of marine isolates from the Baltic sea are pathogenic for rainbow trout. phylogenetic studies indicate that VHSV may have been present in marine fish species in Europe for centuries. the genotypes became separated a long time before fish farming was established in Europe and North America. however, no isolates from wild marine fish were included in this study. ISA is characterized by high mortality, and natural outbreaks have only been described in farmed salmon. the virus may persist and replicate in other salmonid and non-salmonid fish. a recent study by Markussen et al. has provided evidence for the role of recombination and reassortment in the evolution of ISAV. authors have demonstrated the existence of a new marker of virulence next to one of the potential cleavage sites in the F protein. a single amino acid mutation may alter the recognition site, having a direct effect on the virulence of the virus. HV taxonomy underwent a revision by the ICTV [48] in which the previous family Herpesviridae was raised to the order Herpesvirales and split into three families. alloherpesviridae containing fish and amphibian viruses; and Malacoherpesviridae containing one single virus Ostreid herpesvirus (OsHV-1) phylogenetic analysis of different hosts and fish herpesviruses revealed discordance between HV and host lineages. some fish (salmonid, ictalurid and ciprinid) and ranid HV may have coevolved with their hosts, at least at the tips of the phylogenetic tree. aquabirnaviruses have a non-enveloped, icosahedral capsid approximately 60 nm in diameter containing a bisegmented, double-stranded RNA genome. the larger RNA segment contains two partially overlapping open reading frames (ORF), a large ORF encoding the polyprotein and a small ORF encoding VP5 [135]. a seventh genogroup has been proposed [140] to include yellow tail ascites virus (YTAV), isolated in Japan from an epizootic in yellowtail (Seriola quinqueradiata) this genogroup also includes other birnavirus strains isolated from a variety of marine fish and molluscan shellfish in Japan. this genogroup also includes other birnavirus strains isolated from a variety of marine fish and molluscan shellfish the status of knowledge varies dramatically among the different viral groups. for many of them only characterisation of field isolates has been performed. for some viruses, there is field data to support interspecies and interclass transmissions (ranavirus) phylogenetic analysis compared fish herpesvirus and host lineages has revealed discordances that may suggest the existence of interspecies transmission. changes located in the haemagglutinin (HPR) and in the fusion protein are associated with outbreaks in Atlantic salmon. authors' contributions Both authors carried out the compilation and analysis of references related to the subject. all authors read and approved the final manuscript."}
