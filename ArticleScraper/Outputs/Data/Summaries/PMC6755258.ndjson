{"summary": "a 13-year-old previously healthy boy presented to the emergency department in august 2018 with neck pain and left sided facial drooping. he had history of nasal congestion, cough, and fever for five days and started on prednisone. the patient returned to the ED two days later with new onset right shoulder and arm weakness. extensive CSF studies were performed including antibodies for arboviral encephalitis (West Nile, St. Louis, California, Eastern Equine, and Western Equine) all were negative. his nasopharyngeal swab was also negative by PCR for adenovirus, enterovirus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, Chlamydia pneumonia acute transverse myelitis is an immune-mediated spinal cord disorder. about 20% of ATM cases occur in children with an annual incidence of two cases per million. compared to adults, pediatric ATM is more frequently postinfectious, thoracic, longitudinally extensive. MRI spine in ATM shows centrally located lesions with high T2 signal intensity involving grey matter and neighboring white matter. longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis occurs in 66-85% of ATM in children. mycoplasma pneumoniae, Campylobacter jejuni, Borrelia burgdorferi, Acinetobacter baumanii, Coxiella burnetii, Bartonella henselae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Legionella pneumonia, Orientia tsutsugamushi (scrub typhus), Salmonella paratyphi B, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Treponema pallid 0.1% of childhood encephalitis cases are attributed to M. pneumoniae infection. 3,4 M. pneumoniae-associated ATM usually involves the thoracic spinal cord. the proposed mechanisms for mycoplasma induced neurological complications are direct central nervous system invasion or a post-infectious immune process. the latter is probably due to molecular antigenic mimicry between M. pneumoniae and myelin sheath proteins leading to production of anti-neuronal antibodies. risk factors for relapse are female gender and abnormal brain MRI. the patient presented with acute-onset unilateral flaccid weakness without sensory or autonomic changes."}
