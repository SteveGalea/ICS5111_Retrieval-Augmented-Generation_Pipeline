{"summary": "the CHIKV capsid protein (CP) is involved in RNA binding and assembly of the viral particle. the monomeric CP is approximately 30 kDa in size and is small enough for passive transport through nuclear pores. some alphaviruses harbor nuclear localization signals (NLS) CHIKV CP has the ability to shuttle via interaction with karyopherins for its nuclear import and vice versa, by CRM1-dependent nuclear export. the arthropode-borne Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) of the genus alphavirus in the togaviridae family is running rampant along the western and northern Rim of the Indian Ocean. a monopartite NLS is composed of a cluster of five to seven basic amino acids. a typical bipartite NLS contains two clusters of basic amino acids separated by a linker of 10\u201311 aa. NES are specifically bound by exportin known as exportin 1 or Chromosomal Region Maintenance 1 (CRM1) CHIKV CP contains a leucine rich region between amino acids 143 and 155 and docks similar to snurportin-1 CRM1 complex in silico. CHIKV CP contains an active NLS and binds to SFV is a well-studied old world alphavirus and its capsid protein is reported to have an N-terminal NLS. CHIKV CP interacts strongly and specifically with Kar4. HEK293 cells were cotransfected with FLAG-Kar4 and CHIKV-CP-EGFP. the experiment was performed five times and similar results were obtained. complexes consisting of karyopherin and CHIKV CP were detected with an anti-FLAG antibody. the lower panel shows the CP probed with an anti-His antibody. the lower panel shows the CP probed with an anti-His antibody. CP and Kar4 binding occurs as a monopartite NLS-driven interaction. residues highlighted in orange are conserved residues of Kar4 forming the surface of the major and the minor NLS recognition site. HEK293 cells after transfection with FLAG-tagged pCAGGSKar4, Kar4259, or both were incubated with purified CHIKV CP followed by Ni-NTA pull-down. purified CHIKV CP directly interacted with purified GST-tagged CRM1. no interaction was observed in control experiments. CHIKV CP contains a CRM1-dependent NES. a larger C-terminal deletion of 118 aa removed this potential NES. two leucine residues at aa positions 149 and 152 were exchanged against alanine. expression of the altered protein designated NES mutant resulted in a significant decrease of cytoplasmic localization. NES of CHIKV CP forms a protrusion which is ideal for docking to proteins like CRM1. hydrophobic residues 0 to 4 that form the NES of snurportin-1 are docked into the respective binding pockets. NES conserved hydrophobic residues binding to CRM1 pockets contribute most to the global binding energy (Table 1). NES conserved hydrophobic residues binding to 1, 2, 3and 4 of CRM1 contribute most to the global binding energy. CHIKV CP was expressed in E. coli as a His-tagged protein. hek293 cells transfected with various FLAG-tagged karyopherins. hek293 cells were lyzed and incubated with the purified CHIKV CP. CHIKV CP contains an active NLS. Schematic representation of the CHIKV CP NLS-EGFP fusion protein. HEK293 cells after transfection with eucaryotic expression constructs. the secondary NLS binding site is involved in the interaction with monopartite NLS, while the minor binding site associates with bipartite NLS. the acidic residues of the binding site undergo electrostatic interactions with positively charged functional groups of basic amino acids in NLS peptide regions. the upper panel (lanes 1 to 6) was probed with anti-FLAG and the corresponding lanes 4 to 6 in the lower panel with an anti-His antibody. the CHIKV CP contains a CRM1-dependent NES. purified CHIKV CP directly interacted with purified GST-tagged CRM1. the region between aa 149 and 152 acts as a NES that enables the CHIKV CP to be exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm via CRM1. the region between aa 149 and 152 acts as a leucine-rich domain. hek293 cells were transfected either with full-length pCHIKV-CP-EGFP, 46, 118, or an NES mutant (DLAKL to DAAKA indicated by asterisk (* in A) the ratio of nuclear and cytoplasmic GFP accumulation served as a determinant of nuclear import and export. the proposed NES is conserved amongst Old World alphavirus CPs. prototypic NES of snurportin-1 docked to CRM1 as in PDB ID 3NBY. snurportin-1 is colored in magenta and CHIKV CP in cyan. major hydrophobic residues are marked.

CHIKV CP is often associated with a leucine-rich NES. a NES is located in the N-terminal region which is not seen in Old World alphaviruses. structural analysis of CHIKV CP as whole protein showed that it forms a protruding ridge kind of structure. deletion of the 118 C-terminal aa rendered the remaining protein exclusively nuclear. some NES are not optimized for maximum CRM1 binding. conserved hydrophobic residues of the consensus NES in snurportin-1 and CHIKV CP are protruding on one face of the structure to dock into the CRM1. snurportin-1 and CHIKV CP have differences in spacing between conserved hydrophobic residues. VEEV strains contain a wide variety of mutations in the CP that affect its inhibitory function in nuclear import. mutations in the linker peptide of VEEV CP attenuated the ability of H68 peptide to inhibit nuclear import. this also means that both alphaviruses have different functions associated with its nuclear transport of proteins. kungunya virus in both cell types with and without inhibiting nuclear import and export remains unclear. the exact role associated with CHIKV CP nuclear import and export remains unclear and has to be further investigated in an infectious system. amplification with primers HindIIINLScap_fwd 5\u2032-aagcttatgaagccacgcaggaatcgg-3\u2032 and XmaINLScap_rev 5\u2032-atcccgggtctttttttttttttttttg-3\u2032 to create pNLS-EGFP. the mutant with the larger C-terminal deletion 118 was constructed with HindIIIC the deletion mutant pCAGGS 259 Kar4 was constructed by digesting the full-length vector with Tth111I followed by Klenow filling and religation. the cells were pelleted and resuspended in 6 ml of buffer containing PBS and 5% glycerol, and lysed by sonication. pCAGGSKar 1, 2, 3, 4, or 259Kar4 were transfected with either of the FLAG-tagged constructs. resuspended Ni-NTA beads were added to bacterially expressed CHIKV CP, mixed, and incubated further at 4\u00b0C. samples were centrifuged and the supernatant was discarded. lysates were prepared 48 h after transfection in 1.5 ml of RIPA buffer. a 50% suspension of protein AG agarose was added to the lysate. the beads were collected by centrifugation and washed by three with RIPA buffer. all confocal images were quantified at settings where the intensity of GFP fluorescence ranged up to 250 pixel values. a square with an area of 225 pixels was used to measure the mean intensities of six different areas in the nucleus and the cytoplasm of a representative cell. eight representative cells analyzed yielded a total of 48 areas from each, the nucleus and the cytoplasm. pCHIKV CP was amplified from a previously described expression plasmid. the amplimer was inserted into pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) into restriction sites HindIII and XmaI in frame with EGFP. expression in E. coli of the complete CHIKV CP was carried out by inserting a PCR-derived product amplified with chk_petcapsid_fwd 5\u2032-ggatccatggagttcatcccaacc-3\u2032. pGEX-CRM1 containing GST-tagged CRM1 was a kind gift of Nabeel R.
