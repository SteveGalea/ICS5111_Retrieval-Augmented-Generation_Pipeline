{"summary": "the world health organization (WHO) declared that Zika is a public health emergency of international concern in february 2016. our collaborative DNA vaccine consortium focused and accelerated pre-clinical, manufacturing and early clinical development efforts to bring forward the first Zika vaccine, GLS-5700, into human clinical trials. the need for fast and accurate diagnostic tests of infection in an outbreak situation is obvious. the most publicized and dramatic complications are those that occur during fetal development. the most common complication of ZIKV infection is Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome occurring at an estimated rate of 1 in 5000 cases. there are no approved therapies or vaccines for ZIKV infection. a number of vaccine modalities targeting ZIKV have reached early stage clinical trials and even more are in preclinical development. a number of vaccine modalities targeting ZIKV have reached early stage clinical trials and even more are in preclinical development. the avoidance of cross-reactivity is more easily engineered into molecular tests of virus RNA because primers or probes can be designed to be virus-, antigen- and serotype-specific [41,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57], it is not as easily achieved for immunoassays. the need for sensitivity and specificity as it relates to clinical disease identification is of the utmost concern. the five serological Zika diagnostic kits currently authorized by the fda are shown in Table 1 and 14 viral diagnostic kits in Table 2 [73] the FDA has worked collaboratively with developers to accelerate both EUA approvals and the transition to formal full approvals of Zika diagnostic kits using standard review timelines.

ZIKV is detected in serum by RT-PCR for only a short interval following the onset of symptoms. longer periods of RT-PCR detection (up to 53 days) have been observed in serum of pregnant women [53], which may contribute to the incidence of ZIKV-related birth defects. validated assays supporting vaccine efficacy endpoints need to support clinical and regulatory expectations over the life of the product. the development, qualification, validation and maintenance of vaccine clinical assays should be done in close consultation with biostatisticians and bench scientists. the development and validation of sensitive, specific and standardized ZIKV immunoassays are necessary to work toward the establishment of an immune correlate of protection in humans. the development and validation of sensitive, specific and standardized ZIKV immunoassays to better characterize the immune response to vaccination are necessary to work toward the establishment of an immune correlate of protection in humans. biostatistics to analyze assay performance data from development to validation to life cycle performance management. biostatistics to analyze assay performance data from development to validation to life cycle performance management."}
