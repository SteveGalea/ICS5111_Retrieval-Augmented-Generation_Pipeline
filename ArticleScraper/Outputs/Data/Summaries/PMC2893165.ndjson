{"summary": "apoptosis was associated with elevated expression of caspase 3 and muted Bcl-2 expression. oligodendrocytes were refractory to CXCL1 mediated protection from JHMV \u2013 induced apoptosis, readily activating caspase 3 and down regulating Bcl-2 expression. chemokine receptor signaling contributes to chronic neurologic diseases. many resident cell types of the CNS express chemokine receptors under non-inflammatory and inflammatory conditions. chemokine signaling may participate in either repair or exacerbation of pathology following insult, injury, or infection of the CNS. er's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), both CXCL1 and CXCL2 are up regulated within the CNS. in vitro experiments revealed that astrocytes readily express CXCL1 and CXCL2. this suggests that astrocytes are the primary source for these chemokines in vivo. CXCR2 and its ligands CXCL1 and CXCL2 are upregulated during viral \u2013 induced demyelination. mRNA expression pattern of CXCR2 and associated ELR+ chemokines CXCL1, CXCL2 and CXCL5 was assessed within the spinal cord, the primary site of demyelination during chronic encephalomyelitis. C57BL/6 mice were i.c. infected with 500 pfu JHMV and spinal cords removed at defined times p.i. to assess viral burden (A) and transcripts specific for CXCR2, CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL5 using semi-quantitative real time PCR (B) chemokine mRNA expression within the CNS was not affected. blocking CXCR2 did not affect total numbers of virus-specific CD4+ or CD8+ T cells. the increase in clinical severity in mice treated with anti-CXCR2 was neither the result of viral recrudescence, nor alteration in the composition or frequency of infiltrating immune cells. data in panels A\u2013C are representative of four independent experiments. data in panels A\u2013C are representative of two independent experiments. blocking CXCR2 increases the severity of demyelination associated apoptosis. ization significantly (p0.001) enhanced the number of TUNEL-reactive nuclei at days 15 and 17 p.i. within the white matter parenchyma of treated mice compared mice treated with control serum. greater than 90% of the TUNEL reactive cells also co-localized with cleaved caspase 3, indicating that the cells within the white matter were undergoing an apoptotic and not necrotic death. the spinal cord were stained with luxol fast blue to assess myelin integrity (A) Quantification of the total area of demyelination along the entire length of the spinal cord revealed a significant increase in the percent demyelinated area of mice treated with CXCR2 antiserum. CXCR2 signaling reduces JHMV \u2013 induced oligodendrocyte apoptosis in vitro [24]\u2013[27] Previous reports have indicated that JHMV directly induces apoptosis of infected oligodendrocytes in vitro [24]\u2013[27]. Western blotting confirmed the induction of apoptosis. oligodendrocytes were infected with viral nucleocapsid in conjunction with TUNEL. a large proportion of apoptotic cells were unreactive for viral antigen. this suggests additional mechanisms for apoptosis exist that are not dependent upon viral replication within the target cell. CXCL1 protects oligodendrocytes from apoptosis in vitro. differentiated oligodendrocyte enriched cultures were infected with JHMV (moi 1.0), treated with varying concentrations of recombinant mouse CXCL1 and assessed for apoptosis via TUNEL. differentiated CXCR2+/+ and CXCR2/ oligodendrocyte enriched cultures were infected with JHMV (moi 1.0) and treated with recombinant mouse CXCL1 at 10 ng/ml. oligodendrocytes were not protected (*** p0.001, relative to Media) p0.01) elevated mRNA transcripts for both CXCL1 and CXCL2 were observed throughout infection compared to sham-infected control mice. expression was independent of viral load. C57BL/6 mice were treated with CXCR2 neutralizing antiserum or control serum (NRS) from days 12\u201320 p.i. mice were allowed to recover until day 35 p.i. administration of anti-CXCR2 treatment resulted in sustained clinical disease compared to mice treated with control serum. brains and spinal cords from treated mice were removed at the beginning, middle, and end of treatment to assess JHMV viral burden (B) for panel A data is a summation of four independent experiments (anti-CXCR2 n = 32; NRS n = 31) for panel B data is a summation of two independent experiments. blocking CXCR2 increases severity of demyelination associated apoptosis in white matter tracts. oligodendrocytes were undergoing programmed cell death. oligodendrocytes undergoing programmed cell death. the increase in apoptosis did not appear to be a direct causal result of viral persistence within an individual cell. similar frequencies of apoptotic cells containing JHMV nucleocapsid antigen were observed in both experimental groups of mice. these data collectively indicate that CXCR2 signaling during chronic JHMV infection enhances protection of cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage from apoptosis. at day 15 and 17 p.i. and spinal cords were removed and processed for TUNEL labeling. the number of white matter TUNEL-positive nuclei revealed an approximate 3 to 4 fold increase in the number of apoptotic cells in anti-CXCR2 treated mice. oligodendrocyte \u2013 enriched cultures with JHMV increased TUNEL staining. Western blotting confirmed the induction of apoptosis. previous reports that in vitro JHMV triggers apoptosis within infected oligodendrocyte cultures. oligodendrocyte enriched cultures were derived from CXCR2/ mice. this correlated with the presence of activated caspase 3 or the cleavage of PARP. this correlated with the presence of activated caspase 3 or the cleavage of PARP. apoptotic oligodendrocytes treated with recombinant mouse CXCL1 at 10 ng/ml. oligodendrocytes are insensitive to CXCL1 \u2013 mediated protection from apoptotis. oligodendrocytes are not protected from apoptosis. cleaved caspase 3 and Bcl-2 blots are presented panels C and D. data in panels A\u2013D is representative of three independent experiments. findings highlight the importance of CXCR2 signaling in preferential protection of white matter from demyelination. early expression of CXCR2 ligands is critical in disease initiation and relapse. we have recently shown that during acute JHMV-induced encephalomyelitis CXCR2 ligands are important in host defense by attracting neutrophils into the CNS. apoptosis has not been thought to play a major role in pathogenesis. recent evidence has demonstrated that in vitro JHMV induces caspase. oligodendrocytes are also sensitive to FasL [39], TNF[40], [41], and IFN [42], [43] \u2013 induced apoptosis. apoptosis is not restricted to oligodendrocyte lineage cells; microglia and astrocytes have also been reported to undergo apoptosis within demyelinated lesions. however, there is little evidence directly linking either microglial or astrocyte apoptosis to demyelination in vivo. to determine whether CXCR2 signaling was capable of preventing oligodendrocyte apoptosis deficient cultures infected with JHMV were completely insensitive to CXCL1. the protection observed following CXCL1 treatment is mediated through CXCR2. this indicates that the protection observed following CXCL1 treatment is mediated through CXCR2. mice receiving a chemical inhibitor of CXCR2 experienced reduced clinical severity and improved remyelination either during EAE or following lysolecithin microinjection-induced demyelination. the enhanced recovery observed was due to the removal of a migrational blockade and enhanced differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells. in vitro studies demonstrated that CXCR2 specifically protects oligodendrocytes from JHMV \u2013 induced apoptosis. the pro-apoptotic and pro-survival actions of CXCR2 towards oligodendrocytes will prove to be context-dependent. antibody production and administration Rabbit polyclonal antiserum was generated to a 17-amino acid portion of the amino-terminus ligand binding domain of CXCR2. the antiserum blocks CXCR2 dependent infiltration of neutrophils into the peritoneum of mice following thioglycollate irritation. assay conditions were as follows: a 4.5 min - at 95\u00b0C, 45 cycles of 30 sec at 95\u00b0C and 1 min at 58\u00b0C. total RNA isolated from the brains of anti-CXCR2 and NRS treated mice were analyzed with the mCK5c probe set. for quantification of signal intensity, individual chemokine band intensity was normalized to L32 control using Image J.
