{"summary": "autophagy is a highly conserved process in eukaryotes through which cell components are degraded to optimize activity and maintain viability. autophagy also provides a critical line of defense against invading intracellular pathogens including viruses, bacteria, and protozoa. in this review, we will describe recent discoveries concerning autophagy. phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate kinase family is comprised of several lipid kinases that phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol at the hydroxyl group at position 3 of the inositol ring. the PI3K complex, which is composed of VPS34 (catalytic subunit), Beclin 1, and ATG14L (ATG14 like protein), can then translocate to the end Xenophagy Autophagy was initially thought to be a non-selective degradation process. but it is now believed that autophagosomes can degrade substrates and intracellular pathogens in a targeted manner in a process referred to as xenophagy. selective autophagy can be classified into mitophagy (degradation of damaged mitochondria), pexophagy (peroxisomes), lipophagy (lipid droplets), glycophagy ( the host protein ubiquilin 1 (UBQLN1) recognizes Mycobacterium tuberculosis. it recruits autophagy machinery to induce xenophagic clearance of the invading bacterium. it has been consistently reported that some pathogens manage to survive intracellularly due to their ability to evade the host cell\u2019s xenophagic response. autophagy protein Beclin 1 reduces Sindbis virus-induced apoptosis of brain cells and lethality by encephalitis in mice. p62 recognizes Sindbis virus capsid and delivers it to the autophagosome. p62 recognizes Sindbis virus capsid protein and delivers it to the autophagosome. autophagy is also capable of targeting individual viral capsids for degradation. p62 or other autophagy genes have been shown to increase viral capsid accumulation. hepatitis C virus uses autophagy for translation of its RNA. autophagy has been implicated as a mean to restrict HIV-1 infection in T lymphocytes by selectively degrading a HIV-1 protein essential for viral transcription and virion production. similar contradicting results with mouse hepatitis virus have been found in a cell-type dependent manner. complicated relationship between autophagy and virus pathogenesis appears to have a cell- and circumstance-specific manner. autophagy regulates the secretion of inflammatory cytokines by inhibiting the inflammasome pathway. inflammasomes are cytoplasmic complexes that recognize microbial products. they are responsible for upregulating the secretion of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 1 (IL-1) and IL-18. mitochondrial dysfunction can trigger inflammasome activation by NLRP3 [41] autophagy controls the production of IL-1 by targeting pro-IL-1 for lysosomal degradation. p47 induces the lysosomal degradation of polyubiquitinated NF-B essential modulator [47], while murine cytomegalovirus protein M45 suppresses the inflammatory cascade. adaptive immune system recognizes processed peptides from pathogen- or tumor-associated proteins following their presentation on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. autophagy plays a crucial role in the presentation of MHC class I and II molecules for recognition by CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. autophagy also promotes MHC class II presentation of peptides from intracellular source proteins. the number of naive T cells is significantly lower in the absence of mitophagy, which serves as the autophagic clearance process for damaged and aging mitochondria. autophagy induction via the inhibition of p38 in senescent CD8+ T cells increases their proliferation, telomerase activity, and mitochondrial biogenesis. spermine markedly suppressed M1 polarization via the suppression of IL-1 and iNOS gene induction. spermine induced autophagy concomitant with an increase in LC3B-II levels and ATG5 protein expression. spermine-induced Kupffer cell autophagy could be eliminated with the restoration of IL-1 and iNOS (M1 markers) and Arg-1 and Mrc-1 gene induction. old mice have shown slower CD8+ T cell response compared to young mice during influenza vaccination. autophagy level has also been upregulated in Jurkat cells treated with spermidine. spermidine might not be dependent on the mTOR pathway. resveratrol treatment reversed the reduction of SIRT3 expression. resveratrol has been reported to induce autophagy in a peritoneal inflammatory injury model. one study found that enhanced autophagy by resveratrol may prevent human peritoneal mesothelial cells from NLRP3 inflammatory injury. artesunate suppresses pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-, and IL-6 in macrophages. artesunate reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, i.e., TNF- and IL-6. artesunate appears to target upstream signaling pathways that control autophagy rather than directly acting on core components of the autophagy machinery. this may partially explain contradictory results observed following artesunate treatment. trehalose inhibits human cytomegalovirus replication in human foreskin fibroblasts, human aortic endothelial cells, and neural cells. trehalose suppressed symptoms of colitis through autophagy activation. vitamin D regulates both the innate and adaptive immune system, as well as autoimmunity. vitamin D is traditionally known for its role in maintaining bone health and ability to prevent rickets, osteomalacia, osteoporosis. baicalin has been shown to influence the immune system [131,135] and improve antibacterial defenses against Staphylococcus aureus by enhancing lysozyme (LYSO)-mediated bacteriostasis [136]. the activation of autophagy in such circumstances can be attributed to downregulation of the PI3K\u2013Akt\u2013mTOR pathway. ginsenoside Rb1 attenuates apoptosis and induces autophagy in the aorta. ginsenoside Rb1 increased LC3-II and Beclin 1 expression and reduced p62 expression in endothelial cells of the aorta. expression and reducing estrogen receptor expression in eESCs suggests protopanaxadiol may be a potential agent for the treatment of EMS as an autophagy activator. ginsenoside Rg1 has been reported to enhance Th1 and Th2 responses to hepatitis B infection via the TLR4 pathway. if this immune response elicited by Rg1 is autophagy-dependent or not remains unclear. hepatitis refers to several forms of liver disorder and can lead to cirrhosis, liver cancer, and finally death. inflammatory factors were analyzed in mice with hepatitis induced by concanavalin A. EGCG suppressed autophagic activation by blocking BNIP3 signaling. treatment with rapamycin can increase autophagy in TGEV-infected cells. rapamycin inhibits mTOR-dependent autophagy activation by rapamycin. rapamycin inhibits mTOR-dependent autophagy activation. hritis and treatment with rapamycin can help maintain normal renal function. administration with rapamycin relieved podocyte damage. rapamycin has been shown to suppress lipopolysaccharide-induced lung inflammation by increasing autophagy. Mw, is a non-pathogenic mycobacterium that has been reported to elicit anti-cancer effects in various malignancies including melanoma [173,174], breast, cervical, oral, lung, bladder, liver, and prostate cancer [175]. MIP enhanced bacterial killing by increasing the number of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and lymphocytes in lung tissue infected with a low dose aerosol of M. tuberculosis H37Rv further studies are required to determine how MIP interacts with and regulates autophagy. spermine is a natural polyamine that can be found in pumpkin, cheese, and most meat products. it can elicit the upregulation of beclin 1, LC3-I, and LC3-II. spermine-induced Kupffer cell autophagy could be eliminated with restoration of IL-1 and iNOS (M1 markers) and Arg-1 and Mrc-1 (M2 markers) gene induction. spermine may attenuate acute liver injury by enhancing autophagy in Kupffer cells in an ATG5-dependent manner. resveratrol is a stilbenoid that is enriched in red wine and grapes. it has been extensively investigated for its varied effects on human health. this includes autophagy regulation in rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, hepatic steatosis and cancer. resveratrol triggered autophagy via the cAMP\u2013PRKA\u2013AMPK\u2013SIRT pathway. resveratrol is a well-known phytochemical and one of its prime targets is the SIRT\u2013AMPK pathway. artesunate is an artemisinin drug that has been extensively investigated for its application as a malaria treatment. artesunate reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-, and IL-6. artesunate lost its anti-inflammatory function and ability to activate autophagy in TLR4-deficient macrophages. study also found artesunate blocked TRAF6\u2013Beclin 1\u2013PI3KC3 signaling and Beclin 1\u2013PI3KC3 interactions. trehalose Trehalose is a natural disaccharide found in a variety of non-mammalian species. it protects cells from oxidative stress [105], inhibits inflammation [106], ameliorates neurodegeneration [107,108], and induces autophagy [109,110,111,112,113]. trehalose increases the activation of autophagy via an mTOR-independent pathway [112]. trehalose suppressed symptoms of colitis through autophagy activation. the administration of trehalose rescued intestinal damage and weight loss. trehalose reduced the protein expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. vitamin D stimulates autophagy to induce innate immune responses against M. tuberculosis infection. 1a,25-(OH)2D3 triggers autophagic activation in human monocytic THP-1 cells. baicalin suppresses NF-B induction, which is important for full activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. ginsenosides are major bioactive compounds present in ginseng (Panax ginseng), which has been used as a traditional medicine for the treatment of numerous ailments. ginsenoside Rb1-mediated AMPK phosphorylation was the primary mechanism for activating autophagy in macrophages. ginsenoside Rb1 counteracts the development of atherosclerosis by promoting autophagy in endothelial cells and macrophages. EGCG induces activation of pathways involved in autophagy. EGCG also partly inhibits the autophagy proteins Beclin 1 and LC3-II/LC3-I in the reloaded muscles of aged rats. previous studies have shown that EGCG stimulates autophagy in steatosis. EGCG suppressed autophagic activation by blocking BNIP3, an autophagy stimulator, through IL-6\u2013JAKs\u2013STAT3 signaling. rapamycin Rapamycin is a potent mTORC1 inhibitor that can induce the autophagy signaling pathway. rapamycin-mediated autophagy produces diverse outcomes toward controlling viral replication depending on the type of virus and host. studies have suggested that autophagy impairment might enable the development of systemic lupus erythematosus. peptide binds to Nef and inhibits viral replication by inducing autophagy in vitro and in vivo. another peptide derived from Beclin 1 BH3 domain has been designed to bind to the -herpesvirus68 Bcl-2 homolog. regulates TLR-4 signaling, including its downstream components, indicating that MIP enhances the host immune response against tuberculosis. MIP activates NF-B, resulting in increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and NO production, enhancing the immune response. peptide binds to -herpesvirus68 Bcl-2 homolog, which downregulates autophagy and participates in viral reactivation. peptide was shown to selectively abrogate suppression of autophagy mediated by -herpesvirus68 Bcl-2 homolog [172]. 8.11.2. M. tuberculosis clearance induced by MIP was abolished. this occurs via the activation of autophagy. further studies are required to determine how MIP interacts with and regulates autophagy. measures to delicately regulate autophagy might help strengthen the immune system. future studies will have to focus on dissecting the molecular mechanism underlying the pathogen\u2013host\u2013autophagy interplay. human rhinovirus infection (decrease) [114] Unknown (Autophagy activation) Colitis [122] Vitamin D3 (1a,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) Increase Beclin 1 & ATG5 expression (Autophagy activation) Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection [137] Ginsenosides Rb1 Increase Beclin 1 expression (Autophagy activation) Atherosclerosis [147] Protopanaxadiol Unknown (Auto"}
