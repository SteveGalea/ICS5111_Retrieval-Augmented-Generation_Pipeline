{"summary": "preparation Prepare Xylazine-ketamine solution (Ketamine is a controlled substance. Detailed records should be kept and solutions stored in a safe, locked location) clean and sterilize equipment. turing will take 30-40 minutes. apply numbered, colored tape to the tail of each mouse. the hair should be cut as close as possible. injection of cells Attach the needle with needle nut to the Hamilton syringe. clean them by flushing several times with water, then 70% ethanol, and finally HBSS. prepare the Hamilton syringe for cell loading by removing the plunger and loosening the needle nut. the needle is inserted into the superficial fascia on both sides of the incision. the thread is strung through, pulling superficial fascia together. the thread is strung through, pulling superficial fascia together. a 26G3/8 needle injects 0.5ml Lactated Ringers sub-cutaneously in the lower back away from the incision. place mouse back in its cage, avoiding contact between the surgery site and cage bedding. treat mice one time with analgesic buprenorphine (0.05-0.1 mg/kg) following surgery. the hemostat hold the spinalis dorsi muscle connecting the spines of T8 and T9. the needle is lowered through the midline and into the gray matter. the incision is closed with 2-3 staples as needed. preparation of mice for surgery and transplantation Anesthetize the mouse by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (100mg/kg) and xylazine (10mg/kg) in 100 l doses. entire procedure from surgical prep to suturing takes 30-40 minutes. use the scalpel to score the junction between T10 and T11. further expose the junction by carefully scrapping the muscle layer away to expose the bone. slowly insert one blade of the scissors into this gap and snip the pedicle. tomized mouse by the spinalis dorsi muscle connecting the spines of T8 and T9. attach the hemostat to the left micromanipulator arm so that the mouse\u2019s front paws are in the air and its rear paws lightly touching a platform of sterile paper towels. needle holder injects 0.5ml Lactated Ringers sub-cutaneously in the lower back away from the incision. place mouse back in its cage, avoiding contact between the surgery site and cage bedding. treat mice one time with analgesic buprenorphine (0.05-0.1 mg/kg) following surgery. a well-executed transplant will hinge primarily on the careful laminectomy and injection of the cells. the primary pitfall to avoid during a laminectomy is the damaging of the spinal cord. this can occur during the procedure itself or by damage caused by sharp bone fragments left behind following the procedure. a transplant team manning the four different stations (mouse prep, laminectomy, injection, and sutures) is desirable. the timing for each procedure should be optimized to minimize the time the cells are waiting on ice. in this manner, we can transplant cells into 40 mice in about 3 hrs."}
