{"summary": "new antiviral drugs specifically target either the viral protease NS3, the protein NS5A or the RNA polymerase NS5B. a significant proportion of patients requiring treatment still cannot be cured[3], does not have access to treatment[4] and/or will need the development of a vaccine[5]. experimental models are being developed[6], but may not cover all aspects of the pathogenesis of hepatitis C. virions of strains H77 (genotype 1a)[10] or Con1 (genotype 1b)[11] infected human liver slices ex vivo[8]. the fact that these particles retain the possibility to interact with lipoproteins in vitro[8] is in line with previous results[12-14]. er-derived cargo is first shuttled to the ERGIC in a coat protein (COP) II-dependent step. incoming vesicles can also be recycled to the ER in a COPI-mediated process. the ERGIC contributes to the concentration, folding, and quality control of newly synthesized proteins. elucidating mechanisms at work in BHK-21 cells could shed some light on the production of HCV in vivo. cells harboring WNV lineage II SG-replicon encoding Renilla luciferase were propagated in D-MEM supplemented with 10% FBS, Glutamax-I and 5 g/mL blasticidin. pHCV STp7 is a pcDNA3.1(+)-based plasmid (Life Technologies, United States) encoding the structural genes (core, E1, E2) plus p7 of HCV genotype 1a linked to the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate early promoter. the same strain with adaptive mutations[32] were used as templates to construct HCVbp-coding plasmids. cells were seeded at a density of 6 106 cells per 162 cm2 flask. cells were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 3 d in an incubator with a 95% air/5% CO2 atmosphere saturated in humidity. HCVcc (Huh-7.5-produced JFH-1) was obtained by electroporating IVT RNA into Huh-7.5 cells as described[36]. the SN was concentrated, and aliquots of the virus stock were stored at -80 \u00b0C. cDNAs were synthesized from BHK-WNV mRNA. cells were treated with siRNA against RAB1 (2 siRNA per target gene; Dharmacon, united states) for 2 d, re-seeded, and the following day were transfected with HCVbp-coding plasmid. cell lysates and particles released into SN were analyzed by WB. experimental reproducibility Unless specified otherwise, all shown results are representative of at least three independent experiments. cell cultures BHK-21 cells were grown in E-MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone, United States); BHK cells harboring WNV lineage II SG-replicon encoding Renilla luciferase[30] were propagated in D-MEM supplemented with 10% FBS, Glutamax-I and 5 g p90 HCVconFLlongpU[10] and pH-SGNeo (L + I) encoding a SG-replicon of the same strain with cell-culture adaptive mutations[32] were used as templates to construct HCVbp-coding plasmids. antibodies and cellular markers Anti-E2 (ALP98 and AP33)[34], and anti-E1 (A4) monoclonal antibodies were used for Western blot ( the secondary antibodies used were Alexa Fluor 488-, 594- or 635-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies from Molecular Probes. the cells were observed with a laser-scanning confocal microscope and the pictures were deconvoluted. clarified supernatants (SN) were filtered with 0.45 m PVDF membrane. aliquots of the virus stock were stored at -80 \u00b0C. cDNAs were synthesized from mRNA and cloned into pTracer-CMV/Bsd. producer cells, BHK and BHK-WNV cells were transfected with HCVbp-coding plasmid. the following day, cells were reseeded on 8-well chambered coverglass. two days later, cells were fixed and permeabilized as above, then incubated with serum from an HCV-infected patient. RT-TaqManTM PCR with a StepOne Plus thermocycler. cells were incubated with two cell-permeant reagents. the arsenical ReASH-ethane dithiol (Life Technologies) fluoresces upon binding a tetracysteine tag[33]. the cells were then permeabilized and incubated with monoclonal antibodies against HCV1a core (C1), E1 (A4) and E2 (AP33) unlike in hepatic cells expressing a HCV genome[22], we observed that the three HCV1a mAbs stained a large and heterogeneous area in the cytoplasm of BHK-WNV cells expressing the structural genes. odetection of hepatitis C virus proteins of genotype 1a expressed in baby hamster kidney-West Nile virus cells. plasmid encoding Str + p7 of HCV strain H77 (genotype 1a) was transfected in BHK-WNV cells. after 2 d, IF study was performed with monoclonal antibodies (green) targeting core 9-21 (C1), envelope E1 (A4) and E2 (AP33) a compartment recognized by human serum HCV IgG (green) surrounded by mitochondria (red); nucleus counterstained with DAPI (blue) thin sections of BHK-WNV cells expressing HCV genome of genotype 1a were observed by TEM. CANX recruits a subset of HCV proteins into a compartment of BHK-WNV cells for the release of HCV particles. the secretion of glycoproteins involves lectins of the ER, CANX and calreticulin (CRT), microtubule-dependent ER-to-Golgi vesicular traffic[40,41], maturation of their carbohydrates in the golgi apparatus and the secretion machinery of the trans-Go the effect of knocking down CANX and -TUB expression on HCV production was analyzed. treatment of BHK-WNV cells by control or MC5R siRNA did not alter the production or release of HCV. BHK-WNV cells were treated with the indicated siRNA for 2 d and content in CANX was analyzed by WB. cells were then reseeded and transfected the next day with the HCV-coding plasmid together with a control plasmid. two days later, materials released in the SN were analyzed by WB with an antibody recognizing WNV E. CANX and -TUB cDNAs cloned from BHK-WNV cells were inserted into mammalian expression plasmids. expression of recombinant CANX gene restored both CANX levels and HCV secretion. the release of WNV particles was minimally affected by either siRNA treatment. an additional C-type lectin, ERGIC-53, transports properly folded glycoproteins from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. it was slightly lower in BHK-WNV cells and did not co-localize with this pool of HCV proteins detected by the immune sIgG. treatment of producer cells with deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) modified the glycosylation and stability of HCV envelope proteins in BHK-WNV cells. DNJ treatment resulted in decreased resistance of carbohydrates on E1 to a digestion by endo--N-acetylglucosaminidase H (Endo-H) RAB1 exerts a key control on the ER-to-Golgi traffic. in parental BHK-21 cells, RAB1 was spread in the cytoplasm, but co-localized with HCV proteins expressed after transfection. treatment of BHK-WNV cells with RAB1 siRNA greatly reduced HCV protein expression. the ER-to-Golgi machinery as well as the Golgi apparatus contributed to HCV production in BHK-WNV cells. the expression of RAB1 GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI)[49] was enhanced and co-localized with HCV proteins in a pattern reminiscent of RAB1\u2019s. parental or baby hamster kidney-West Nile virus cells were transfected to express hepatitis C virus genome in the cytoplasm. IF experiment was performed and analyzed as described throughout the manuscript. similarities between HCV productions in BHK-WNV and Huh-7.5 cells. hepatitis C virus produced in cultured human hepatic cells involves same cellular factors as those enhancing hepatitis C virus production in baby hamster kidney-West Nile virus cells. cells were seeded on 24-well plates and the next day were transfected with siRNA. the human HCV serum used in BHK-WNV cells was of a different genotype than JFH-1. it was not obvious co-localization of the staining it elicited in Huh-7.5 cells inoculated with HCVcc and that of the studied cellular factors. caspase-1 is required for release of HCV particles via interplay with viral non-structural genes Caspase-1 is a cysteine protease. the common denominator of some twenty NLR/ALR inflammasome complexes identified so far. cleavage sites for caspase-1 are present on HCV E2, NS2 and NS3. core protein with a predominant size of 21 kDa in treated vs 23 kDa in untreated cells. no clear effect of the inhibitor was observed on HCV production. BHK-21 and BHK-WNV cells were transfected with a mix of HCVbp-coding and P2B plasmids. ids based on hepatic cells expressing a HCV genome[22] stained a large and heterogeneous area in the cytoplasm of BHK-WNV cells expressing the structural genes. a neutralizing mAb from the serum of a patient (HCV1a sIgG) who had been cured from hepatitis C of this genotype stained a more limited and heterogeneously shaped compartment of the cytoplasm. HCV1a sIgG specifically recognized bands with apparent molecular weights of 21 kDa and 75 kDa. plasmid encoding Str + p7 of HCV strain H77 (genotype 1a) from an early human cytomegalovirus promoter or a system of plasmids (P2B) were transfected in BHK-WNV cells. cells were transfected with a mix of HCVbp-expressing and P2B plasmids (8). a compartment recognized by human serum HCV IgG (green) surrounded by mitochondria (red); nucleus counterstained with DAPI (blue) thin sections of BHK-WNV cells expressing HCV genome of genotype 1a were observed. brefeldin A prevented the secretion of HCV by BHK-WNV cells, while it did not affect that of exosomes. two components of the classical secretion path, CANX and microtubules, have been previously implicated in HCV life cycle in other systems[27,44,45]. the effect of knocking down CANX and -TUB expression on HCV production was analyzed. the effect of knocking down CANX and -TUB expression was sufficient to abolish BHK-WNV permissiveness for HCV production. HCV serum of Figure 1 (green) and anti-CANX antibody (red) followed by confocal microcopy analysis. nucleus were counterstained with DAPI (blue); DAPI (blue); DAPI (blue); d: top panels; d: top panels; d: top panels; d: top panels; d: top panels; d: top panels; d: top panels; d: top panels; d: top panels; p70 or Hsp90 were chosen as controls since they associate with exosomes[46,47], which are particulate materials secreted by BHK-WNV cells yet distinct from HCV particles[8]. in contrast, HCV E2 did not accumulate in BHK-WNV cells (Figure 3B) expression of recombinant CANX gene partially restored both CANX levels and HCV secretion. CANX: Calnexin; BHK-WNV: Baby hamster kidney-West Nile virus. n-glycans of HCV envelope proteins are required for non-classical secretion of HCV particles by BHK-WNV cells. but CRT expression was lower in BHK-WNV cells than in parental cells. materials released in SN (top and middle panels) or cell lysates (bottom panel) were collected, incubated with or without Endo-H. DNJ treatment resulted in decreased resistance of carbohydrates on E1 to a digestion by endo--N-acetylglucosaminidase H (Endo-H) infected cells or in baby hamster kidney cells chronically replicating a dengue 2 subgenomic replicon. RAB1 exerts a key control on ER-to-Golgi traffic. in parental BHK-21 cells, RAB1 was spread in the cytoplasm. cells treated with RAB1 siRNA were transfected with the HCV expression plasmid system. IF was performed as in (B); A-C: Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. cells and SN were harvested 3 d later, and analyzed by Western blot. parental or baby hamster kidney-West Nile virus cells were transfected to express hepatitis C virus genome in the cytoplasm. IF experiment was performed and analyzed as described throughout the manuscript. virus genome in the cytoplasm and IF experiment was performed and analyzed as described throughout the manuscript. host factors assisting HCV production in BHK-WNV cells also play a role in the JFH-1 strain of genotype 2a/Huh-7.5 hepatocarcinoma cell paradigm. IF was performed with anti-HCV core 7-50 (green) and anti-human CANX, tubulin (TUB) or RAB1 antibodies (red); d later, the cells were incubated with both ReASH (red) and Taxol fluorophore conjugate (green); result representative of two independent experiments. in a live-cell immunofluorescence study, the pattern of NS5A-4cys was reminiscent of that observed with the same construct expressed in BHK-WNV cells[8]. however, this pattern was different from the staining of NS5A (without a tag) detected with an in-house antibody against a 48 aa-long peptide[8], suggesting that distinct NS5A protein species were observed with two detection methods. each species could differentially affect HCV we tested the effect of an inhibitor preferentially targeting caspase-1 (ZYVAD-FMK) on the production of this strain of HCV by BHK-WNV cells. no clear effect of the inhibitor was observed on HCV production with BHK-WNV cells expressing only HCV structural genes, with or without p7. a classical secretion pathway has been implicated in the release of HCV virions[59] that are associated with apolipoprotein E (apoE) in Huh-7.5 cells[60] or other cell types[61]. despite a fully functional secretion pathway, parental BHK-21 cells released only trace amounts of HCV particles[8]. some arguments are consistent with the involvement of a conventional secretion pathway in the production of HCV particles by BHK-WNV cells. some arguments are consistent with the involvement of a conventional secretion pathway in the production of HCV particles. RAB1 and its GDI have been reported to initiate a cascade of events involving GBF1, ARF1 and phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase III alpha (PI4KIII)[43], which may increase the local proportion of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase III alpha (PI4KIII)[63] and subvert endocytic trafficking[64]. if CANX was required for the vesicles are formed by the fusion of late endosomal vesicles with membranes from lysosomal and/or autophagosomal compartments. they are formed by the fusion of late endosomal vesicles with membranes from lysosomal and/or autophagosomal compartments. reorganization of secretion machinery required for production of HCV particles by BHK-WNV cells displayed similar features. heat-shock proteins released by BHK-WNV cells did not coincide after ultracentrifugation on a density gradient. the release of heat-shock proteins was insensitive to a treatment by brefeldin A (BFA), an inhibitor of GBF1[8]. brefeldin A (BFA), an inhibitor of brefeldin A (BFA), abolished the release of HCV particles. a viral cysteine protease is required for the production of HCV particles[73], as is the helicase/serine protease NS3[74]. the cleavage of NS2/3 by caspase-1, in addition, could prevent the maturation of non-structural proteins required for RNA replication. the release of HCV particles by BHK-WNV cells involved an unusual, if not unconventional secretion pathway. this could be a mean by which HCV circumvents intracellular defenses. this could be a mean by which HCV circumvents intracellular defenses. plasmids encoding HCV RNA of genotype 2a were generous gifts from Arvind H Patel (anti-E2; MRC Virology Unit, Institute of Virology, University of Glasgow), Ramsey C Cheung (anti-E1; Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Stanford University School of Medicine), Stanislas Pol (HCV serum; H\u00f4pital and Institut Cochin, Paris) the authors examined the possibility that the endoplamic reticulum (ER)-bound lectin calnexin (CANX), the small GTPase RAB1 and microtubule-associated alpha-tubulin were involved in the production of infectious HCV by BHK-21 cells. the fact that infectious HCV particles are produced independently from lipoprotein biosynthesis, yet retain the possibility to interact with lipoproteins in a second step. a viral RNA genome encoding the non structural genes required for its own replication in the cytoplasm. the authors aimed to examine whether the cellular factors including CANX, RAB1 and alpha-tubulin were involved in the production of infectious hepatitis C virus particles by model human hepatocellular carcinoma. alpha-tubulin, which all contribute to the secretion of several glycoproteins by BHK-21 cells, was involved in the production of HCV particles by BHK-WNV cells. the re-wired pathway bypassed the conventional ER-to-Golgi intermediary compartment and involving components of the inflammasome. the fact that infectious HCV particles are produced independently from lipoprotein biosynthesis, yet retain the possibility to interact with lipoproteins in a second step it brings an interesting contribution to the current literature."}
