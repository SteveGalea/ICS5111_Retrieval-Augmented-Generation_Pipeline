{"summary": "fibrosing alveolitis is an irreversible accumulation of connective tissue in the interstitial and airway of the lung. the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis is complex and remains poorly understood. chemotactic for fibroblasts induces the synthesis of matrix proteins and glycoproteins. inhibits collagen degradation by induction of protease inhibitors and reduction of metalloproteases. all patients were diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis according to a high-resolution computer tomography (HRCT) of the lung or biopsy. diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis was based on the official the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and/or the European Respiratory Society (ERS) statement. a random-effect was used to estimate pooled ORs and 95% CIs. heterogeneity was found with I2 > 10%. the range of I2 values quantifies the between-study variability present not owing to random chance. the inclusion criteria of literature were as follows: case-control design, all patients were diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis, according to a high-resolution computer tomography. the diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis was based on the official the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and/or the European Respiratory Society (ERS) statement. a random-effect was used to estimate pooled ORs and 95% CIs. heterogeneity was found with I2 > 10%. the range of I2 values quantifies the between-study variability present not owing to random chance. any TGF-1 SNPs that were reported by 2 or fewer findings were omitted from our selection. the following SNP was excluded owing to limited publications or insufficient data (rs1800471). I-Gamel et al[20] included pulmonary fibrosis patients with non-IPF disease. the rest of studies involved patients all diagnosed as having IPF. the average male-to-female ratios were found to be 1:1.56 for cases. 0.86 [0.61, 1.22] in the homozygote comparison model (TT vs TC + CC); 1.13 [0.83, 1.54] in the recessive model (TT + TC vs CC) there was no statistically significant association between TGF-1 rs1800470 polymorphism and PF in any of the ethnic and disease subgroups. there was a trend that the frequency of pulmonary fibrosis was less in genotype TT than that a diamond whose width represents the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the estimated effect size (OR) OR = odds ratio. each study is represented by a square whose area is proportional to the weight of the study. of 124 non-duplicate studies, we removed 97 studies due to the following reasons: the study was not about TGF-1 or pulmonary fibrosis (n = 39); they did not have an abstract (n = 5); or they were not the original research articles (n = 53), if they were reviews (n = 46), meeting reports (n = 2), or meta-analysis (n = 5). 7 applicable studies covering only one eligible TGF-1 SNP (rs1800470) were published between 1998 and 2015. sample size ranged from 79 to 368. 3 were conducted in china; 1 in Korea, Britain, Spain and Saudi Arabia. wei et al[19] and EI-Gamel et al[20] included SARS and pre-transplant pulmonary fibrosis. no significant association was found between TGF-1 rs1800470 polymorphism and pulmonary fibrosis in any of the comparison models we used. each study is represented by a square whose area is proportional to the weight of the study. the overall effect from meta-analysis is represented by a diamond whose width represents the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the estimated effect size (OR). OR = odds ratio. Figure 9. Funnel plot of publication bias with pseudo 95% confidence limits for homozygote model. Figure 8. Funnel plot of publication bias with pseudo 95% confidence limits for dominant model. the TT genotype had a positive association with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis development (P =.037). the proportion of subjects with an CC genotype was significant higher in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis group than that in control group subjects. however, several other studies could not find any noticeable association of TGF-1 rs1800470 polymorphism with pulmonary fibrosis. the present meta-analysis was only able to collect data on one most studied SNP. there are other relevant TGF-1 SNPs that have been implicated in pulmonary fibrosis susceptibility. some of our results may be hampered by this shortcoming. a large number of case-control studies with the information on other related genetic polymorphisms could provide reliable evidence for the role of TGF-1 polymorphism with respect to susceptibility to pulmonary fibrosis."}
