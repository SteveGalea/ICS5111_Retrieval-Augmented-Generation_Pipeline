{"summary": "Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus of the genus Phlebovirus (family Bunyaviridae) the virus was first isolated in 1930 in east africa (14) and has since caused severe epidemics and epizootics throughout Africa and the Arabian peninsula (11, 30) tens of thousands of human and livestock cases have involved no effective, commercially available human vaccines or antiviral drugs. the development of an effective vaccine or therapeutic to treat RVF in humans remains an important area of research. the fda's animal rule allows for the demonstration of drug or vaccine efficacy using animal studies instead of human clinical trials (44). this rule recommends testing of potential vaccines and therapeutics with well-described animal models. rhesus macaques became viremic and developed a fever. leukocytosis was evident, followed by leukopenia. but no signs of disease resulted, except for a decrease in activity during peak of fever. rhesus macaques were usually infected intravenously (i.v.) with 5 log10 PFU of RVFV. the outcome of these infections can be broadly divided into three groups. rhesus macaques with severe clinical disease developed signs of illness 2 to 4 days after infection. fewer than 20% of rhesus macaques infected with RVFV develop severe disease. i.v. infection does not represent a natural exposure route. the development of a more susceptible NHP model using a more natural exposure route would be advantageous. twenty healthy adult marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), 2 to 11 years old and ranging in weight from 279 to 547 g, were obtained from either the Institute of Chemical Defense (ICD) or GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) none of these primates was exposed to any infectious pathogens in previous studies. tissue was collected for viral titer determinations and histopathology. research was performed under an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee-approved protocol. the facility where the research was conducted is fully accredited by the association for assessment and accreditation of laboratory animal care international. tissues collected from moribund animals were titrated by a standard plaque assay. a 1:10 dilution of the supernatant was added to a 24-well plate of Vero cells in duplicate in a volume of 100 l for each well. the mixture was incubated for 4 days to monitor cytopathic effects. histology sections were cut at 5 to 6 m on a rotary microtome, mounted onto glass slides, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE). normal hepatic tissue served as the negative control; the positive-control tissue was liver from a known RVFV-positive animal. radish peroxidase-conjugated antibody was assayed in serum from rhesus macaques and in plasma from marmosets with a 50% PRNT as previously described (7). repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare chemistries, viremias, percent changes in weight, and percent changes in temperature over time and between groups. exposure route received 7 log10 PFU/ml RVFV in a 1-ml volume i.v., s.c. and one animal to serve as a negative control for the i.n. exposure route. blood samples were collected from animals exposed i.v. within 5 min of virus inoculation to ensure that i.v. exposure occurred. chemistry analyses were performed by the addition of whole blood to a lithium heparin tube (Sarstedt) using a comprehensive diagnostic panel analyzed with a Vetscan instrument. the plasma was then collected for viral titer determinations by a quantitative RT-PCR. full necropsies and histological examination were performed by a board-certified veterinary pathologist. tissue sections were cut at 5 to 6 m on a rotary microtome, mounted onto glass slides. serum-free protein block (Dako) plus 5% normal goat serum were applied for 30 min. the primary antibody was then applied onto the tissue at a dilution of 1:100. the tissue sections were rinsed and then exposed to the EnVision horseradish peroxidase-labeled polymer for 30 min at room temperature. i.v. (7 log10 PFU), s.c. (two doses, 5 and 7 log10 PFU), and i.n. (7 log10 PFU), and rhesus macaques were exposed i.v. to 7 log10 PFU of RVFV for a direct comparison with the current NHP model. the percent survival (Fig. 1), viremia (Fig. 2), weights (Fig. 3), body temperatures (Fig. 4), blood chemistry rhesus macaques exposed i.v. (A) and marmosets exposed i.v. (B), s.c. (C), and i.n. (D) to RVFV (n = 4). asterisks indicate an animal that succumbed or was euthanized. the boxes represent the normal ALT reference range variability in healthy animals. viremia in marmosets exposed i.v. peaked on day 1 p.i. compared to peak day of viremia of rhesus macaques. viremia in marmosets exposed i.v. peaked on day 1 p.i. compared to peak day of viremia of rhesus macaques. viremia in marmosets exposed i.v. peaked on day 1 p. temperatures of rhesus macaques and marmosets exposed i.v. did not differ significantly throughout the study (P = 0.57) one rhesus macaque had a slight increase in temperature, which peaked on day 6 p.i., and one marmoset had a slight decrease in temperature on day 4 p.i., but the general trend remained similar. viremia correlated with the presentation of signs of clinical illness. marmosets exposed s.c. and that succumbed or were euthanized had decreases in temperature. the ALT and alkaline phosphatase levels were highest in the animals exposed s.c. marmosets exposed i.n. showed a significant overall decrease in weight after exposure (P 0.01) similar to marmosets exposed s.c., the marmosets exposed i.n. that succumbed or were euthanized had decreases in temperature (P = 0.66) the primary gross pathology finding identified in marmosets that succumbed to infection by the i.v. or s.c. route of exposure was an enlarged (about 2 to 3 times the size of an uninfected control), yellow-orange, friable liver. the primary gross pathology finding identified in marmosets that succumbed to infection by the i.v. or s.c. route of exposure was an enlarged (about 2 to 3 times the size of no directly attributable pathological changes in the liver were noted for the rhesus macaques exposed to RVFV. rhesus macaques showed a fibrin thrombus in a vessel. he stain of the lung showing fibrin thrombus in a vessel (delineated by an asterisk) he stain of the choroid layer of the eye showing fibrin thrombus in the vessels (delineated by an asterisk). he stain of the pons region of the brain showing an acute infarct (delineated by arrows) with a fibrin thrombus in an adjacent blood vessel (delineated by an asterisk a marmoset exposed to 7 log10 PFU s.c. that was euthanized on day 12 p.i. showed widespread positive staining for RVFV antigen in the retina of the eye without histologic changes. however, positive antigen staining of the retina was not observed for any of the other marmosets that succumbed to RVFV. all rhesus macaques and some marmosets developed neutralizing antibody titers. by day 14 p.i., all animals sampled developed neutralizing antibody titers. only one animal developed an RVFV IgG titer. marmosets exposed i.v. (n = 4) had one animal that succumbed on day 2 postinfection. two others presented with clinical illness, which was characterized by anorexia, decreased activity, and ruffled fur/hunched posture. half of the marmosets that were exposed s.c. (n = 4) succumbed or were euthanized. viremia in marmosets exposed i.v. peaked on day 1 p.i. compared to peak day of viremia of rhesus macaques (day 2 p.i.) marmosets had levels of viremia that were on average 1 log10 PFU higher (P = 0.27) over the course of the study, there were no significant changes in the weight of the rhesus macaques and the marmosets exposed marmosets exposed s.c. were exposed to 5 log10 PFU of RVFV s.c. viremia persisted until the animals succumbed or were euthanized. viremia persisted until the animals succumbed or were euthanized, and the level of viremia correlated with the presentation of signs of clinical illness. marmosets exposed i.n. developed viremia (Fig. 2D), which peaked on day 2 or 3 p.i. and declined steadily until the animals succumbed or were euthanized. marmosets that were exposed i.n. did show a significant overall decrease in weight after exposure (P 0.01). tissues were collected at the time of necropsy, and the viral titers were determined by a standard plaque assay for the animals that succumbed or were euthanized. Virus was found in the liver of all marmosets exposed i.v. and s.c. but in only two out of four of the animals exposed i.n. the kidney was the only tissue where virus was detected in all marmosets. degenerate hepatocytes often contained variably sized, clear, round vacuoles (lipid) in the cytoplasm. eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies were observed in hepatocytes. hepatocytes showed intense positive staining for RVFV antigen. ney, lung, choroid layer of the eye, and brain showed DIC. none of the other animals that succumbed to infection by any other route of exposure exhibited evidence of DIC. hematoxylin and eosin stain of the kidney showed a fibrin thrombus in a vessel. immunohistochemically, there was intense multifocal positive staining of neurons for RVFV antigen. one of the marmosets exposed s.c. that succumbed to RVFV on day 11 p.i. showed widespread positive antigen staining of the retina without histologic changes. rhesus macaques and some marmosets developed neutralizing antibody titers as early as day 7 p.i. on day 14 p.i., all animals sampled developed neutralizing antibody titers except for the uninfected controls. only one animal developed an RVFV IgG titer. rhesus macaques exposed i.v. (R-IV) (A) and marmosets exposed i.v. (M-IV) (B), s.c. (M-SC) (C), and i.n. (M-IN) (D) to RVFV (n = 4) DISCUSSION The results of this study identified the common marmoset as a useful model of severe human RVF. marmosets euthanized on day 4 p.i. (exposure to 7 log10 PFU) and day 7 p.i. (exposure to 5 log10 PFU) appear to have succumbed from acute-onset hepatitis. marmosets euthanized on day 11 p.i. and day 12 p.i. the route of neuroinvasion in these marmosets is unclear and will require serial sampling studies to evaluate the spread of the virus over time. the meningoencephalitic form of RVF occurs in less than 1% of natural human cases (25), but residual central nervous system symptoms are common in neurological cases. the neutralizing antibody titers were slightly higher in the marmosets exposed to RVFV s.c. at the lower dose. marmosets exposed s.c. had the lowest body temperatures at the time of euthanasia. the amount of virus associated with infected animal tissues, body fluids, aborted fetal materials, and placental membranes is very high. the incidence of CNS manifestations resulting from an aerosol infection has been speculated to be much greater than is typical with peripheral infection."}
