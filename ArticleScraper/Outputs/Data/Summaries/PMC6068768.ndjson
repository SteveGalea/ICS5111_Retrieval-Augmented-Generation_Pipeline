{"summary": "seasonal influenza vaccination is the appropriate method to minimize the risk of death and hospitalization from influenza complications in T2DM patients. the motivators of influenza vaccination include both personal and health status factors. fear from vaccine side effects and misimpression of vaccine inefficacy are the most reported barriers toward vaccination. a cross sectional study targeted male and female T2DM patients attending chronic disease clinics in the eleven PHCCs in abha City. the total number of patients regularly attending the PHCCs was 4324 patients, a conservative anticipated proportion of 50% for vaccination coverage, and an absolute precision of 5% at a 95% confidence interval. 2.6. Ethical Approval The study was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. written approval was obtained from the directorate of health sector in Aseer region and Abha City. experts in epidemiology, biostatisticians, and seasonal influenza vaccination programs validated the questionnaire. it includes personal information such as, age, sex, education, and occupation. it includes clinical data such as the onset of T2DM, duration, compliance with management plans, complications and co-morbidities. the most frequently reported motivators of seasonal influenza vaccination among included vaccinated or willing participants were advise from healthcare givers 183 (84.7%). absence of healthcare givers\u2019 recommendations and the difficult access to vaccine were the least reported barriers among unvaccinated group (8.8% and 0.7%).
