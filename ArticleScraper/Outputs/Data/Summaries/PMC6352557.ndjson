{"summary": "multifocal demyelinating lesions eventually lead to various clinical symptoms such as impaired motor skills, cognitive decline, behavioral deficits, and vision loss. new areas of investigation are focusing on identifying how oligodendrocytes may contribute to disease [6] and developing strategies that promote maturation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells into mature myelin-producing oligodendroglia. the cause of MS is multifactorial and includes the genetic background of the individual as well as potential environmental influences. no clear causal relationship between MS and viral infection has been established. the development of animal models in which clinical and histopathology is similar to that observed in most patients. myd88 is an adapter protein that provides a critical role in transmitting signals provided by TLRs that leads to expression of type I IFN (IFN-I) in addition to proinflammatory genes. infection of myd88-/- mice increased mortality associated with failure to control viral replication and enhanced neuropathology. IFN-I enhances expression of cytokines, chemokines and increasing expression of MHC and costimulatory molecules. previous studies have highlighted the importance of type I IFNs in host defense against neurotropic viruses. the importance of attracting neutrophils is highlighted by the demonstration that blocking the migration of these cells via treatment with neutralizing anti-CXCR2 results in increased mortality. the effect of anti-CXCR2 treatment was specific for neutrophils as T cell migration is not impacted following administration of this antibody. the key functional role for both CXCL9 and CXCL10 is to attract virus-specific T cells into the CNS by signaling through CXCR3. the function of CXCL10 appears limited to the recruitment of activated T cells as antiviral effector functions e.g., proliferation, secretion of IFN-, and cytolytic activity remained intact. CD4+ T cells are essential to prolong primary CD8+ T-cell function in the CNS as well as influencing memory CD8+ T cells for recall responses. defining discrete functional roles of microglia in host defense in response to microbial infection is challenging in the face of infiltrating myeloid cells that may have overlapping functions. microglia depletion led to increased infiltration of monocyte/macrophages into the CNS. there was an overall reduction in frequency and numbers of IFN-producing CD4+ T cells. this likely contributed to the increase in viral titers within the CNS. intracranial infection of IFN-I-receptor knock-out mice resulted in increased mortality. expression of IFN-I-stimulated genes was impaired, accompanied with reduced expression of MHC class I. however, trafficking and accumulation of virus-specific CD8+ T cells was not affected in the absence of IFN-I signaling. chemoattractant chemokine interferon-inducible protein 10 kDa (IP-10)/CXCL10 is rapidly expressed in response to JHMV infection. expression of CXCL10 is in response to early expression of IFN-I as this cytokine has previously been shown to induce CXCL10 expression. the key functional role for both CXCL9 and CXCL10 is to attract virus-specific T cells into the CNS by signaling through CXCR3. the function of CXCL10 appears limited to the recruitment of activated T cells as antiviral effector functions. microglia play critical role in early innate and virus-specific T cell responses. microglia depletion led to increased infiltration of monocyte/macrophages into the CNS. microglia depletion led to increased infiltration of monocyte/macrophages into the CNS. the findings illustrate important and previously unappreciated roles for microglia in contributing to protection from viral encephalomyelitis. sterile immunity is not achieved and JHMV persists primarily in white matter tracts. inflammatory T cells and macrophages are considered important contributors to white matter damage in JHMV-infected mice. the importance of the immune system in driving demyelination is further highlighted by experiments in which targeting chemokines e.g., CXCL10 or CCL5 that attract activated T cells and macrophages limits the severity of white matter damage. neutrophils are a hallmark pathological feature of neuromyelitis optica (NMO) neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is triggered by autoantibodies directed against the water channel aquaporin 4 expressed on astrocytes. animal studies modeling NMO have found reduced neuroinflammation and myelin loss following treatment with neutrophil protease inhibitors. proteins including adhesion molecules (ICAM1 and VCAM1) and the neutrophil chemoattractants CXCL1 and CXCL2 contribute to increasing the permeability of the BBB. these molecules attract and anchor neutrophils to the vasculature and this contributes to increasing the permeability of the BBB. relapsing patients showed increased plasma levels of CXCL5 during lesion formation. expression levels of CXCL1, CXCL5, and neutrophil elastase also correlated with measures of MS lesion burden. findings argue that neutrophils may contribute to disease progression in patients. mice in which neutrophils lack suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) exhibit an increase in susceptibility to the atypical EAE. this correlates with preferential recruitment of neutrophils into the cerebellum and brainstem. TMEV infection of the CNS results in a rapid mobilization of neutrophils and monocytes recruited to the CNS. ines bind and signal through CXCR2 pathway to rapidly recruit neutrophils to the BBB. this also contributes to host defense by increasing BBB permeability via release of MMPs which subsequently enhances infiltration of virus-specific T cells. the function of these cells in models of viral-induced demyelination have not been as well-characterized. mice correlated with increased disease severity associated with neutrophil infiltration into the CNS and enhanced white matter damage. we are now seeking to define mechanisms by which CNS infiltrating neutrophils participate in white damage. this includes secretion of reactive oxygen/nitrogen intermediates and neutrophil extracellular traps. representative luxol fast blue (LFB)-stained spinal cords reveals increased demyelination in mouse hepatitis virus-infected double tg mice compared to single tg controls. Flow cytometric analysis revealed a significant increase in the frequency and total number of neutrophils within the spinal cord of JHMV-infected double tg mice compared to single tg mice. possible neutrophil mechanisms of action include release of reactive nitrogen species (RNS) [105] and reactive oxygen species (ROS) [106] intermediates, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) [83] and select cytokines [107]. NET release is characterized by the neutrophil releasing DNA structures to ensnare foreign pathogens through chromatin decondensation. patients have shown higher circulating levels of NETs in serum from relapsing remitting MS patients compared to healthy controls. a follow-up study by sospedra and colleagues [113] found higher circulating NETs in male relapsing remitting MS patients compared to women suggesting an underlying sex-specific difference in pathogeneses. the heterogeneous cellular nature of MS lesions argues that other cell types may be contributing to disease relapsing patients showed increased plasma levels of CXCL5 during lesion formation. expression levels of CXCL1, CXCL5, and neutrophil elastase also correlated with measures of MS lesion burden. findings argue that neutrophils may contribute to disease progression in patients. mice in which neutrophils lack suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) exhibit an increase in susceptibility to the atypical EAE. the site of neutrophil recruitment may be critical in terms of amplifying histopathology. TMEV infection of the CNS results in a rapid mobilization of neutrophils and monocytes recruited to the CNS. these chemokines bind and signal through CXCR2 pathway to rapidly recruit neutrophils to the BBB. this also contributes to host defense by increasing BBB permeability via release of MMPs which subsequently enhances infiltration of virus-specific T cells [39]. the function of these cells in models of viral-induced demyelination have not been as well-characterized. induced expression of CXCL1 in CXCL1-dg mice correlated with increased disease severity associated with neutrophil infiltration into the CNS. blocking of neutrophil infiltration into the CNS ameliorated the severity of demyelination [102] luxol fast blue (LFB)-stained spinal cords reveals increased demyelination in mouse hepatitis virus-infected double tg mice compared to single tg mice. Flow cytometric analysis revealed a significant increase in the frequency and total number of neutrophils within the spinal cord. possible neutrophil mechanisms of action contribute to white matter damage. NET release is characterized by the neutrophil releasing DNA structures to ensnare foreign pathogens through chromatin decondensation. patient studies have shown higher circulating levels of NETs in serum from relapsing remitting MS patients compared to healthy controls. a follow-up study by sospedra and colleagues [113] found higher circulating NETs in male relapsing remitting MS patients compared to women suggesting an underlying sex-specific difference in pathogeneses. the exact mechanisms of neutrophil contribution to demyelination remain obscure. recent studies argue for a role for NETs and other neutrophil host defenses as possible instigators of damage."}
