{"summary": "human DDX3 is a member of the DEAD box RNA helicase family. they are generally involved in ATP-dependent unwinding of double-stranded RNAs and remodeling of ribonucleoprotein complexes (1, 2). DDX3 and its yeast homolog Ded1 have been implicated in various cellular processes (3). a hamster temperature-sensitive DDX3 mutant cell line, tsET24, was impeded at the nonpermissive temperature (32) the helicase activity of DDX3 can be repressed by RK-33, a small-molecule inhibitor of DDX3. DDX3 plays a key role in antiviral innate immune signaling pathways (27\u201331) DDX3 knockdown results in inhibition of phagocyte migration and phagocytosis in macrophages. the expression of several proinflammatory cytokines was markedly downregulated in DDX3 knockdown cells after either lipopolysaccharide or poly(IC) stimulation. DDX3 also controls the translation of genes involved in bacterial infections. pathogen-associated molecular patterns are unique microbial molecules that are recognized by PRRs in host cells during innate immunity. inflammation is triggered when innate immune cells detect infection or tissue injury. trypanosomiasis 0.0036 P38, PPP2CB, MAP2K4, P38, GNAS, CCL5, TGFB1 Oocyte meiosis 0.0045 ANAPC1, CCNE1, ANAPC5, PPP2R5B, PPP2CB, PRKACA, FBXW11 Sphingolipid signaling pathway 0.0072 PRKCZ, PPP2R5B, P38, PPP2CB, RAC GNB2, RAC1, RALA, PRKACA, EGLN1, GNAS, STAT1, TGFB1, TRAF4, FH Human T-cell lymphotropic virus 1 infection 0.0299 ANAPC1, ANAPC5, ELK4, RRAS2, MAP2K4, IL15RA, PRKACA, IL15, TGFB1 Rap1 signaling pathway 0.0305 PRKCZ, FGFR4, PARD3, P38, RAC1, RALA, P38, DDX3 regulates expression of PACT, STAT1, GNB2, Rac1, TAK1, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) proteins in THP-1 and HeLa cells. DDX3-regulated genes involved in infections and inflammation. the small G protein Rac1 is required for phagocytosis in macrophages during inflammation (45\u201347). p38 MAPK participates in a signaling cascade that controls many cellular processes. DDX3 knockdown may not only reduce the production of interferons and inflammatory cytokines but also inhibit the inflammatory response and phagocytosis. the knockdown of DDX3 caused by shDDX3-2 did not result in a significant change in global translation (15, 16) the fractional distribution of 18S and 28S rRNAs was not significantly affected by DDX3 knockdown in HEK293 cells. HEK293 cells were transduced with the empty lentiviral vector (pLKO.1) or the pLKO.1 vector expressing DDX3 shRNA (shDDX3-2) the cells were harvested for analysis at 3 days posttransduction. total RNA was extracted from each fraction for analysis. PK11 (p38), MAPK12 (p38), and GAPDH mRNAs in the mock-treated (pLKO.1) and DDX3 knockdown (shDDX3-2) HEK293 cells were calculated and are represented as percentages. DDX3 may facilitate the translation of mRNAs containing long or structured 5\u2032 UTRs. firefly luciferase (Fluc) reporter genes containing the 5\u2032 UTRs of PACT, STAT1, GNB2, Rac1, TAK1, and p38 MAPK mRNAs were constructed. the fluc reporter with the 5\u2032 UTR of -actin mRNA that is not a target of DDX3 was not affected by DDX3 knockdown. DDX3 controls the translation of PACT, STAT1, GNB2, Rac1, T HEK293 cells were transduced with the empty lentiviral vector (pLKO.1) or the pLKO.1 vector expressing DDX3 shRNA (shDDX3-2) after 48 h, the cells were cotransfected with firefly luciferase reporters containing the 5\u2032 UTRs of PACT, STAT1, GNB2, Rac1, TAK1, p38 MAPK, and -actin mRNAs. in vitro transwell cell migration assay was performed using PMA-induced THP-1 cells. DDX3 knockdown cells showed markedly lower cell migration than mock-treated cells did. a significant reduction was observed in the DDX3 knockdown PMA-induced THP-1 cells. puromycin was added to the culture medium for selection. at 2 days posttransduction, PMA was added to induce differentiation of monocytes to macrophages. migrated cells were stained purple with 0.5% crystal violet. DDX3 regulates the expression of proinflammatory cytokines during viral and bacterial infections. PACT, TAK1, and p38 MAPK are known to be involved in the induction of proinflammatory cytokines. mRNA expression patterns of cytokines are relatively similar to those of proteins in LPS-treated THP-1 cells. knockdown of DDX3 downregulates cytokine expression mainly at the transcriptional level. DDX3 knockdown resulted in the downregulation of IFN- production induced by poly(IC) at the mRNA level. pLKO.1 or the pLKO.1 vector expressing DDX3 shRNA (shDDX3-2) at 3 days posttransduction, cells were stimulated with 80 ng/ml of LPS or 1 g/ml of poly(IC) for 6 h to mimic bacterial or viral infection. the relative mRNA levels of the cytokines normalized to GAPDH were analyzed using quantitative real-time RT-PCR. the expression of chemokines CCL1, CCL2, and CXCL10 was impaired in the DDX3 knockdown THP-1 cells. DDX3 knockdown is crucial for the recruitment of monocytes/macrophages to sites of inflammation. zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a suitable model organism with which to investigate phagocyte recruitment and inflammation. X3a and DDX3b MOs were microinjected into developing zebrafish embryos. knockdown of DDX3a/b caused the development of bent-tail phenotype. RT-PCR analysis revealed that the DDX3a/b MOs efficiently blocked the correct splicing of DDX3a and DDX3b pre-mRNAs. the PCR products were resolved on a 2% agarose gel. the detection of -actin mRNA served as a loading control. an inflammatory response was induced by tail transection. the number of recruited neutrophils was determined by sampling 4 or 5 zebrafish larvae per group. data are shown as means SDs from four independent experiments. DDX3-regulated genes are involved in infections and inflammation. DDX3 controls the translation of genes involved in inflammatory signaling pathways, such as the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway, rheumatoid arthritis, and the chemokine signaling pathway. DDX3 also controls the translation of genes involved in inflammatory signaling pathways. simplex virus infection 0.0156 TAK1, CSNK2A2, IFIT1, IRF7, IL15, CDC34, CCL5, STAT1 RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway 0.0176 TAK1, ATG5, P38, IRF7, P38, PACT TNF signaling pathway 0.0177 TAK1, P38, MAP2K4, P38, IL15, CCL5 Adherens junction 0.0185 TAK1, CSNK2A TGFB1, ATP6V0A2, ATP6V0B Influenza A 0.0382 P38, IRF7, MAP2K4, P38, CPSF4, CCL5, STAT1 Platelet activation 0.0383 PRKCZ, ARHGEF1, P38, PRKACA, P38, GNAS Osteoclast differentiation 0.0394 TAK1, P38, RAC1, P38, STAT1, TGFB1 Vibrio cholerae infection 0.03 lentivirus expressing short hairpin RNA to specifically knock down DDX3 expression in human monocytic THP-1 and HeLa cells. the level of DDX3 protein was significantly reduced in the THP-1 and HeLa cells transduced with either of the DDX3-targeting shRNAs. shDDX3-2 was more effective than shDDX3-1 in inhibiting DDX3 expression. p38 MAPK proteins in THP-1 and HeLa cells were transduced with either the empty lentiviral vector (pLKO.1) or the pLKO.1 vector expressing the indicated shRNAs. cells were harvested for analysis at 3 days posttransduction. a decrease in polysome association was accompanied by an increase in 40S ribosome association. this indicated that the translation of the aforementioned proteins was inhibited because of DDX3 knockdown in the HEK293 cells. the translational efficiency of a transcript was defined as the ratio of the mRNA abundance in the polysome fractions to the mRNA abundance in the total fractions. total RNA was extracted from each fraction for analysis. mRNA was resolved by 1% denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis. the amount of mRNA was detected by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. the average length of 5\u2032 UTRs in mRNAs is 300 nucleotides (nt) the average length of 5\u2032 UTRs in randomly selected mRNAs is only about 246 nt. mRNAs contain long or GC-rich 5\u2032 UTRs that are likely to form stable secondary structures. the fluc reporter with the 5\u2032 UTR of -actin mRNA that is not a target of DDX3 was not affected by DDX3 knockdown. therefore, DDX3 may facilitate the translation of PACT, STAT1, GNB2, Rac1, TAK1, and p38 MAPK mRNAs by resolving secondary structures within the complex 5\u2032 UTRs. the 5\u2032 UTR sequences of PACT, STAT1, GNB2, Rac1, T DDX3 knockdown cells were lysed for analysis at 24 h posttransfection. for each transfectant, the Fluc activity was normalized to that of the control. DDX3 participates in macrophage migration and phagocytosis. s of phagocytosis in the PMA-induced THP-1 and U937 monocytic cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. we also treated the THP-1 cells with a DDX3-specific inhibitor, RK33, which can bind to DDX3 and abrogate its helicase activity. we suggest that DDX3 should be required for macrophage migration and phagocytosis. the THP-1 and U937 cells were transduced with the empty lentiviral vector (pLKO.1) or the pLKO.1 vector expressing DDX3 shRNA (shDDX3-2) at 2 days posttransduction, phagocytosis was quantified using the uptake of GFP-expressing E. coli at an MOI of 20. a human cytokine antibody array was used to analyze changes in cytokine expression in DDX3 knockdown THP-1 cells after either LPS or poly(IC) stimulation. the levels of CCL1, CCL2, CCL5, CXCL10, and TNF- were decreased in the DDX3 knockdown THP-1 cells compared to the mock-treated controls. IL-1 is also a crucial mediator of the inflammatory response to injury and infections. quantitative real-time RT-PCR showed that ectopic expression of p38 MAPK rescued the LPS-stimulated elevation of CCL2 mRNA expression in DDX3 knockdown THP-1 cells. however, we cannot rule out the possibility that DDX3 is also involved in transcription or RNA stability of cytokine mRNAs. relative mRNA level of cytokines normalized to GAPDH was analyzed using quantitative real-time RT-PCR. data are shown as means SDs from two independent experiments. DDX3 is crucial for recruitment of phagocytes to sites of inflammation in zebrafish. two homologous DDX3a and DDX3b genes are present in zebrafish. antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (MOs) have been used successfully in zebrafish to knock down expression of specific genes in vivo. a human DDX3 antibody was used to detect the expression of zebrafish DDX3a/b proteins. a weak band was observed in the region corresponding to the predicted molecular weight of DDX3 (approximately 80 kDa) DDX3a/b knockdown zebrafish larvae were anesthetized using 4.2% tricaine. the recruitment of neutrophils was 50% lower in the DDX3a/b knockdown zebrafish than in the controls. DDX3 may play a crucial role in phagocyte migration and the recruitment of phagocytes to inflammation sites. DDX3 also participates in inflammatory signaling pathways, including PRR signaling pathways, rheumatoid arthritis, and chemokine signaling pathway. it is not surprising that DDX3 is involved in two protozoan diseases, namely, American trypanosomiasis and leishmaniasis. chemokine signaling pathway is required for phagocyte migration and production of inflammatory cytokines. chemokines CCL1, CCL2, CCL5, and CXCL10 are crucial chemokines that attract phagocytes to sites of inflammation. knockdown of DDX3 results in a decrease in the phosphorylation of NF-B p65 and IKK-. DDX3 directly regulates phagocyte migration and phagocytosis through translational control of STAT1, GNB2 and Rac1. DDX3 also regulates the translation of TAK1 and p38 MAPK kinases. STAT1 and Rac1 are involved in phagocyte migration to inflamed tissues. Rac1 is also required for phagocytosis (45). DDX3-mediated translational control plays multiple roles in viral and bacterial infections and the inflammatory response. DDX3 in inflammatory bowel diseases (74) are characterized by chronic production of proinflammatory cytokines and high levels of matrix metalloproteinases. a thorough understanding of DDX3-mediated translational control in inflammation may open new avenues for the development of anti-inflammatory therapeutics. pMT3 p38 was a gift from John Kyriakis (Addgene plasmid 12658) all plasmids required for lentivirus production were provided by the national RNAi core facility (Academia Sinica, Taiwan) primary antibodies used included affinity-purified rabbit anti-DDX3 (0.1 g/ml) (15), mouse anti-tubulin (0.2 g/ml) and rabbit anti-PACT (1:1,000 dilution; Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), rabbit anti-STAT1 (1:1,000 dilution; Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-p38 MAPK (1:1,000 dilution; Cell Signaling, GeneTex, Inc.) cell pellets were resuspended in RSB-150 (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 3 mM MgCl2 and 150 mM NaCl) containing 100 g/ml of cycloheximide, 40 g/ml of digitonin (Calbiochem), 20 U/ml of RNasin (Promega), and 1 protease inhibitor cocktail. quantitative real-time PCR was performed using fast SYBR green master mix. for zebrafish DDX3a, forward primer (FP) 5\u2032GTCATTACAAGGTCTCAAGAAGG3\u2032 and reverse primer (RP) 5\u2032CAAATGAGGAGGAATGTAACGCC3\u2032. for zebrafish DDX3b, FP 5\u2032AGTTTCATCGAGCACCGTCGACC3\u2032 and RP 5\u2032GCTT CTTTCT FP, 5\u2032TGGCTCTGTGTGCTGCTT3\u2032; RP, 5\u2032GACCTGAACAACATCGTCAAGTG3\u2032 MAPK11 (p38) FP, 5\u2032GACCTGAACAACAACATCGTCAAGTG3\u2032; RP, 5\u2032GCCGAGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGT DDX3 knockdown and mock-treated HEK293 cells were transfected with a pFL-SV40-derived reporter (0.25 g) and the control pRL-SV40 vector (0.25 g) at 24 h posttransfection, cells were lysed in 1 passive lysis buffer (Promega) macrophages were harvested for analysis via a BD Accuri C6 flow cytometer. to inhibit the helicase activity of DDX3, PMA-induced THP-1 cells were treated with the empty lentiviral vector (pLKO.1) or the pLKO.1 vector expressing shDDX3-2. after 3 days, THP-1 cells were treated with 80 ng/ml of LPS or transfected with 1 g/ml of poly(IC) to transgenic zebrafish larvae were anesthetized by immersion in a glass-bottom 35-mm dish. each embryo was placed into a layer of 3% methylcellulose (wt/vol) each embryo was placed into a layer of 3% methylcellulose (wt/vol) 293 cells were grown at 37\u00b0C in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml of penicillin, and 100 g/ml of streptomycin.
