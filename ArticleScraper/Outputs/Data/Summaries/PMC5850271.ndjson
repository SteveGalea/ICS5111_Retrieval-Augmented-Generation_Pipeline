{"summary": "eukaryotic exonic splice enhancers (ESEs) are purine-rich binding-site motifs found at exon ends assisting recruitment of the splicing machinery by regulatory proteins. codon and amino acid content toward exon ends is biased. there are claims that the CDS is under selection to bind transcription factors. motifs for RNA binding proteins that bind to introns are avoided within CDSs. a common fingerprint of additional CDS functionality is biased codon usage. a common fingerprint of additional CDS functionality is biased codon usage. in bacteria, there is a common bias at CDS fourth sites for amino acids whose codons start with adenine (A) the prevalence of A-starting second codons and positive influence on expression has previously been described. we propose and test a number of alternative hypotheses. the frameshift correction model extends the current understanding of the role of out of frame stop codons. it provides the first evidence for site-specific selection of stop codons out of frame. this preference for A at the fourth site may, in addition, have become canalized and so feature as part of the start codon recognition mechanism. fourth site enrichment is specific to A and not attributable to GC biases. if the usage of A at fourth sites is functionally relevant we would expect its usage to be more resilient to GC pressure than for A-starting codons. E. coli and Shigella spp. undergo accelerated gene loss when compared with E. coli. if there is selection at the fourth site, we expect substitutions at the fourth site to be reduced when compared with others. the proportion of sequences with a substitution from A at site 4 is displayed with the dotted line. position 1 of the first codon demonstrates minimal variation away from an A-genotype confirming the preference for an A-genotype. genomes with extreme GC compositions demonstrate reduced range of mean CAI values. results suggest that fourth site A is more commonly used in highly expressed genes. but when conditions are conducive to incorporating an A-starting second codon, we expect A-start. the 5\u2032 CDS is known to have distinct selection pressures to those acting on the remainder of the CDS. selection favors codons that reduce mRNA folding around the translation start, regardless of whether these codons are frequent or rare. alanine, cysteine, proline, serine, threonine, and lysine may be used more frequently in the second position in highly expressed genes. the second amino acid is implicated in the N-end rule pathway (overview in Tasaki et al. 2012), targeting proteins for degradation. mRNA to interact efficiently with ribosomes and promotes translation efficiency. there exists a relationship between 5\u2032 mRNA folding strength and protein expression levels in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. studies have identified second codon AT preference promoting faster translation initiation. the frameshift correction model provides a novel and site-specific case of out of frame stop codons more generally. both CDSs encode methionine followed by serine and have identical GC content. however, following a +1 frameshift sequence A encodes a cysteine followed by a leucine. the frequency with which codons form out of frame stops are used is largely predictable from the underlying GC pressure. selection to reduce costs in genomes where frameshifting is most deleterious can explain the richer tRNA repertoire found in such genomes. if there is an amino acid level selection we expect to see mostly T-starting serine (ST) and C-starting arginine (RC) both maintain AT content destabilizing the 5\u2032 mRNA domain. both SA and ST are more frequent in the second position than expected. a comparable analysis for A/C-starting arginine amino acids is slightly less discriminatory as C-starting arginine does not maintain the AT-content. a ratio of 1:4.390 for genome mean RA:mean RC (N = 646) use demonstrates greater dependence on C-starting arginine. if selection were at the nucleotide level we expect multiple amino acids with A-starting codons to be over-represented so long as they facilitate posttranslational modifications. if selection were at the nucleotide level we expect multiple amino acids with A-starting codons to be over-represented so long as they facilitate posttranslational modifications. lysine encoded by two coding blocks is expected to be used more frequently in GC-poor genomes. a preference for A-starting amino acids except methionine and isoleucine, regardless of genome GC content, is observed. methionine is avoided with only A-starting amino acids preferred. a-starting asparagine is preferred but does not feature in either posttranslational modification pathway. selection is not for amino acids themselves but for A-starting codons. if there is selection for A-rich codons in the 5\u2032 domain, GC content should be more independent of genome GC content than codons downstream. this resilience to GC pressure in the 5\u2032 mRNA domain is suggestive of alternative selection pressures acting to determine synonymous site composition. significant differences between the A-ratios at the nonsynonymous sites (sites 4, 7, and 10). the mean A4 enrichment (1.873 0.375, N = 646) greater than A7 (1.488 0.129, N = 646). the frameshift model dictates that the stop codon must be the TGA stop codon. we expect enrichment at synonymous sites in genomes not using TGA to only occur at levels similar to those in codons 3 and 4 due to 5\u2032 RNA stability constraints. the mean residual for table 4 genomes is again negative and lower (0.070) than for those using the standard genetic code (0.006). this may result from phylogenetic nonindependence introduced when increasing data set. the distance to the next +1 stop codon in genes with fourth site A is greater than those without. the distance to a +1 stop codon is significantly greater in genes with fourth site A. the presence of an immediate frameshift correction mechanism appears to influence location of further downstream out of frame stop codons. we observe increased distances to the second +1 stop codon from a mean of 141.334 73.537 (N = 646) nucleotides without fourth site A to 144.718 78.656 (N = 646) nucleotides. third +1 stop codon from 212.226 105.601 (N = 646) nucleotides without fourth site A to 215.238 110.525 (N = 646) nucleotides. 640/646 genomes (99.07%) have an A4 ratio significantly >1 (P 0.01, Pearson\u2019s cumulative test statistic [2], Bonferroni correction) in comparison, 31/646 (4.80%), 3/646 (0.46%), and 55/646 (8.51%) genomes have C4, G4 and T4 ratios >1 respectively. this exceptionalism of the fourth site is further illustrated by the striking reduction in fourth site GC variation. the proportion of coding sequences with fourth site A is maintained above the proportion of A-starting codons as GC content increases. the regression coefficient for all A-starting codons is significantly greater than for A-starting second codons (P = 7.056 1019, Z = 8.874, two-tailed Z-test of equivalency) loss of A in the fourth position is significantly reduced compared with downstream positions. this lack of change specific to the fourth site A genotype is indicative of purifying selection at the fourth site. the mean CAI value for CDSs with fourth site A (0.586 0.088, N = 232) is only slightly greater (0.582 0.088, N = 232) than for those without. the difference in mean CAI in CDSs using A (mean CAI = 0.661 0.034, N = 30) is small. the most extreme is Polaribacter sp. in which 63.26% of CDSs have A at the fourth site. 640/646 genomes (99.07%) have an A4 ratio significantly >1 (P 0.01, Pearson\u2019s cumulative test statistic [2], Bonferroni correction) GC variation (supplementary fig. S1, Supplementary Material online) shows the proportion of coding sequences with each nucleotide (A, C, G, T) at coding sequence sites 4, 5, 6, and 7. site 4 demonstrates a clear preference for A which is not observed at the other sites. if the usage of A at fourth sites is functionally relevant we would expect its usage to be more resilient to GC pressure. E. coli and Shigella spp. undergo accelerated gene loss when compared with E. coli. if there is selection at the fourth site, we expect substitutions to be reduced. position 1 of first codon shows minimal variation away from an A-genotype. substitutions from an A-genotype are reduced when compared with other nucleotides. genomes with extreme GC compositions demonstrate reduced range of mean CAI values. results suggest that fourth site A is more commonly used in highly expressed genes, albeit to a small degree, and even maintained under extreme GC restrictions. the 5\u2032 CDS is known to have distinct selection pressures to those acting on the remainder of the CDS. in bacteria selection favors codons that reduce mRNA folding around the translation start. the trend is not explained by selection for nonoptimality but AT-content. a et al. (2010) note particular amino acids may be used more frequently in the second position in highly expressed genes. the second amino acid is implicated in the N-end rule pathway (overview in Tasaki et al. 2012), targeting proteins for degradation. there exists a relationship between 5\u2032 mRNA folding strength and protein expression levels in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. studies have identified second codon AT preference promoting faster translation initiation (Zalucki et al. 2007) frameshift correction model provides a novel and site-specific case of out of frame stop codons. both CDSs encode methionine followed by serine and have identical GC content. however, following a +1 frameshift sequence A encodes a cysteine followed by a leucine. translation of sequence B is immediately terminated by the presence of an out of frame TGA stop codon. the frequency with which codons form out of frame stops are used is largely predictable from the underlying GC pressure. selection to reduce costs in genomes where frameshifting is most deleterious (notably GC rich ones) can explain the richer tRNA repertoire found in such genomes. n-terminal methionine excision occurs when the second amino acid is glycine, alanine, serine, threonine, cysteine, proline, or valine. the second amino acid is implicated in the N-end rule pathway. signaling proteins requiring specific concentrations of hydrophobic amino acids may also contribute to amino acid bias. the frameshift correction model consider a CDS that starts NTGA, with A at the fourth site. this sequence becomes the TGA stop codon, immediately terminating or realigning translation and preventing the ribosome continuing on a + 1 reading frame. a +1 frameshift sequence encodes a cysteine followed by a leucine. translation of sequence B is immediately terminated by the presence of an out of frame stop codon. many ribosomal frameshifts are errors. frameshifting is most deleterious (notably GC rich ones) can explain richer tRNA repertoire found in such genomes. 99.84% of CDSs within genomes in this study use a NTG start codon. both SA and ST are more frequent in the second position than expected. the mean deviation within genomes from the expected number of CDSs utilizing serine as the second amino acid is greater for A-starting (mean observed\u2014expected #x0003D; 170.186) a ratio of 1:4.390 for genome mean RA:mean RC (N = 646) use demonstrates greater dependence on C-starting arginine within CDSs. a second amino acid ratio of 1:1.565 highlights the greater dependence on A-starting arginine at the second site. each amino acid encoded for by A-starting codons is preferred at the second position regardless of genome GC content. avoidance of methionine\u2013methionine cannot be attributed to general avoidance of methionine pairs as they are found more frequently than expected given genome methionine usage. a preference for A-starting amino acids except methionine and isoleucine is observed. the ability to facilitate NME may explain weak proline and alanine preferences. if selection is at the protein level A-starting amino acids not involved in cleavage should be avoided. the use of amino acids not involved in either pathway suggests selection is operating on underlying nucleotide content. if selection is acting to increase A content, we expect little difference between A enrichment of the second codon and contiguous codons. the mean A6 ratio (1.954 0.802, N = 646) confirms A-enrichment. comparisons between A6 ratios and A9 and A12 ratios show weakly significant A content variation at these synonymous sites. pairwise comparisons suggest enrichment at each site is significantly different. we find the mean A4 enrichment greater than A7 (1.488 0.129, N = 646) and A10 (1.344 0.105, N = 646). five of the 651 genomes in this study use this alternative genetic code. a4 ratios demonstrate an enrichment of A (1.277, 1.443, 1.548, 1.362, and 1.099, respectively) but, importantly, are significantly lower than the A4 ratios for genomes using the standard genetic code. table 4 genomes may fall into two categories: those that have greatly reduced enrichment and those that are similar to genomes using the standard genetic code (0.006) this may result from phylogenetic nonindependence introduced when increasing the data set with the majority of genomes being Mycoplasmas. the mean distance to a +1 stop codon is significantly greater in genes with fourth site A. the presence of an immediate frameshift correction mechanism appears to influence location of further downstream out of frame stop codons. stop codon from 212.226 105.601 (N = 646) nucleotides without fourth site A to 215.238 110.525 (N = 646) nucleotides. the incorporation of an immediate +1 stop codon appears to subtly shift the sequence of frameshift capture codons downstream. the preservation of A4 under increased GC pressure is consistent with stronger selection in GC rich genomes. the mean deviation within genomes from the expected number of CDSs utilizing serine as the second amino acid is greater for A-starting (mean observed\u2014expected #x0003D; 170.186) than T-starting serine (mean observed\u2014expected = 70.774) for all amino acids in the genome, we find the mean SA:mean ST ratio equal to 1:1.762 (N = 646). a ratio of 1:4.390 for genome mean RA:mean RC (N = 646) use demonstrates greater dependence on C-starting arginine. a second amino acid ratio of 1:1.565 highlights the greater dependence on A-starting arginine at the second site. each amino acid encoded for by A-starting codons is preferred at the second position regardless of genome GC content. avoidance of methionine\u2013methionine cannot be attributed to general avoidance of methionine pairs as they are found more frequently than expected given genome methionine usage. the ability to facilitate NME may explain weak proline and alanine preferences. if selection is primarily for amino acid functionality, non-A starting amino acids involved in modifications should be preferred. primary residues (leucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan) are avoided. six-fold degenerates serine, leucine, and arginine are encoded by synonymous codons in two codon blocks. if there is an amino acid level selection we expect to see mostly T-starting serine (ST) and C-starting arginine (RC) a similar analysis for A/C-starting arginine amino acids is slightly less discriminatory. a ratio of 1:4.390 for genome mean RA:mean RC (N = 646) use demonstrates greater dependence on C-starting arginine within CDSs. if selection were at the nucleotide level we expect multiple amino acids with A-starting codons to be over-represented so long as they facilitate posttranslational modifications. if selection were at the peptide level we expect multiple amino acids with A-starting codons to be over-represented so long as they facilitate posttranslational modifications. a general avoidance of methionine-isoleucine pairs may provide some explanation for second site avoidance. a preference for A-starting amino acids except methionine and isoleucine is observed. methionine is avoided with only A-starting amino acids preferred. if selection is at protein level, selection is operating on underlying nucleotide content. if selective constraint is to reduce 5\u2032 mRNA stability, we also expect a degree of T enrichment within this domain. GC variability at synonymous sites is more extreme than at other positions. if there is selection for A-rich codons in the 5\u2032 domain, GC content at synonymous sites should be more independent of genome GC content than codons downstream. we expect similar A-ratios between the nonsynonymous sites. comparisons suggest enrichment at each site is significantly different. the mean A4 enrichment is greater than A7 and A10. despite AT requirements in the initial 5\u2032 mRNA domain, the fourth site exhibits significant enrichment not observed at other nonsynonymous sites. we therefore cannot attribute the increased fourth site A content solely to RNA stability selection. 0.053, Welch two sample T-test) or A10 ratios for the fourth codon (P = 0.835, Welch two sample T-test) in genomes using the standard genetic code. in order to control for GC content, we performed a loess regression between total genomic GC content and A4 enrichment ratios. in this case, we found no significant difference between the enrichment ratios. the absence of TGA as a stop codon relaxes selection for especially high A4 content. the remaining A excess seen can be accounted for in terms of selection for decreased 5\u2032 mRNA stability. the lower A4 ratios in table 4 genomes cannot be owing to weakened purifying selection. the presence of an immediate frameshift correction mechanism appears to influence location of further downstream out of frame stop codons. we observe increased distances to the second +1 stop codon from a mean of 141.334 73.537 (N = 646) nucleotides without fourth site A to 144.718 78.656 (N = 646) nucleotides. we would expect enrichment at synonymous sites in genomes not using TGA to occur at levels similar to those in codons 3 and 4 due to 5\u2032 RNA stability constraints. five of the 651 genomes within this study use this alternative genetic code (NCBI translation table 4) the mean residual for table 4 genomes is again negative and lower (0.070) than for those using the standard genetic code (0.006) this may result from phylogenetic nonindependence introduced when increasing the data set with the majority of genomes being Mycoplasmas. the excess of A at site four is consistent with preventing the ribosome initiating on the wrong reading frame. if the ribosome begins translation on an incorrect reading frame, there is less demand for another local +1 stop codon. we therefore expect that the distance to the next +1 stop codon in genes with fourth site A is greater than those without. third +1 stop codon from 212.226 105.601 (N = 646) nucleotides without fourth site A to 215.238 110.525 (N = 646) nucleotides. preservation of A4 under increased GC pressure is consistent with stronger selection in GC rich genomes. splice control by ESEs may be considered as a control of missplicing errors. the presence of stop codons within introns appears to be NMD-mediated mechanism to catch splice errors. the ambush hypothesis proposes that there is an excess of out of frame stops and that coding sequences frequently use and are under selection for codons that have the potential to form out of stop codons. the bias toward codons contributing to out of frame stops seems largely predictable from the underlying GC pressure. the +1 TGA may prevent read-through following the translation of an upstream gene. the +1 TGA may prevent read-through following the translation of an upstream gene. we find evidence against the last of these models. TG and TGT report the weakest binding initiator. the increased enrichment at the more efficient start codons implicates the fourth site in increasing initiation efficiency. stop codons in 5\u2032 leading regions allow termination of translation events that initiate before the ribosome reaches the correct start codon. we find no evidence for fourth site enrichment specific to A within eukaryotes. many human and plant genes tend instead to have GC rich terminal ends. the ribosome is a dual coding mechanism functionally linked with the prokaryotic ribosome and initiation mechanics. eIF1A, a universally conserved eukaryotic homolog of bacterial eIF1 has evolved both N- and C-terminal domains stimulating recruitment of methionyl initiator tRNA to ATG. selection for nucleotides in the Kozak sequence (Kozak 1986, 1997) may be stronger than that on the fourth site A that would provide a similar regulation signal. selection for A/T content in the 5\u2032 domain reducing RNA stability is not limited to bacteria, but is infrequent in eukaryotes. the preference for particular non-A starting amino acids (alanine, proline, and T-starting serine) indicate a selection pressure for amino acids promoting cleavage. b. subtilis trp RNA binding attenuation protein (TRAP) binds optimally to the sequence 5\u2032-RUACARGGAUGU-3\u2032. the bacteriophage T4 regA binds near the start codons and interactions with the fourth site when binding to the consensus sequence 5\u2032-AAAAUUGUUAUGUAA-3\u2032. a series of variables go some way to explaining the enrichment of A at fourth sites. a multivariate model using genome A-starting codon use, 5\u2032 A enrichment, leader gene use and the translation table explains over 50% of the variation in genome fourth site A use. splice control by ESEs may be considered as a control of missplicing errors. the presence of stop codons within introns appears to be NMD-mediated mechanism to catch splice errors. the ambush hypothesis proposes that there is an excess of out of frame stops and that coding sequences frequently use and are under selection for codons that have the potential to form out of stop codons. the bias toward codons contributing to out of frame stops seems largely predictable from the underlying GC pressure. bacterial 70 S ribosomes have the ability to scan the mRNA. the presence of a SD sequence provides an important signal for selection of the correct start codon. the identity of the start codon has also been shown to determine translation efficiency. both panicker et al. and Osterman et al. (2013) report GTG is the more efficient initiator. the increased enrichment at the more efficient start codons again implicates the fourth site in increasing initiation efficiency. we find no evidence for fourth site enrichment specific to A within eukaryotes. many human and plant genes tend instead to have GC rich terminal ends. the ribosome is a dual coding mechanism functionally linked with the prokaryotic ribosome and initiation mechanics. eIF1A, a universally conserved eukaryotic homolog of bacterial eIF1 has evolved both N- and C-terminal domains stimulating recruitment of methionyl initiator tRNA to ATG but preventing and discriminating against non-ATG initiation. selection for nucleotides in the Kozak sequence (Kozak 1986, 1997) may be stronger than that on the fourth site A that would provide a similar regulation signal. eukaryote analyses also raise further unresolved issues. selection for A/T content in the 5\u2032 domain reducing RNA stability is not limited to bacteria, but is infrequent in eukaryotes. if selection was primarily for facilitative amino acids we should observe an A enrichment in eukaryotes. b. subtilis trp RNA binding attenuation protein (TRAP) binds with the ycbK putative efflux protein at NAG motifs across the initiation region. the bacteriophage T4 regA binds near the start codons and interactions with the fourth site when binding to the consensus sequence 5\u2032-AAAAUUGUUA-3\u2032. a comparative analysis in both genomes that do and don\u2019t employ TGA as a stop would be especially valuable. a comparative analysis in both genomes that do and don\u2019t employ TGA as a stop would be especially valuable. a comparative analysis in both genomes that do and don\u2019t employ TGA as a stop would be especially valuable. etic nonindependence (additional genomes of that genus were discounted) larger than 500,000 base pairs left 651 genomes. 186 protist genomes were downloaded from the Ensembl database (Kersey et al. 2016) non-NTG start codons are too rare for meaningful analysis. non-NTG start codons are too rare for meaningful analysis. n can take any value from 1 to the length of the longest gene. a local BLAST database was generated from filtered E. coli O157 CDSs using BLAST v2.4.0. if there was more than one match, the ortholog with the lowest expected value (E) and percentage match was chosen. the proportion of sites changing from each nucleotide in each codon was calculated from the total counts. high expression correlates with a high CAI value in several organisms. a reference set of CDSs was selected to represent the highly expressed genes. only genomes with annotations for 20 of these genes were considered. for each CDS, a 60-nucleotide window centered on the start codon was extracted and G\u00b0 was calculated by aligning the 16S rRNA tail at each position in this window. the position with minimal G\u00b0 was considered the optimal binding site. AOD scores calculate the difference between the frequencies of an amino acid in the second position compared with the average frequencies compared with all positions in the CDS. genomes were further categorized equally into low (GC 44.19%), medium (44.19% GC 60.91%) and high (GC 60.91%) GC to account for biases. cleotides, without internal stop codons, had a stop codon defined by the relevant translation table. if more than one ORF was identified, the longest ORF was chosen. algorithm was trained on the E. coli O157 genome to identify leader genes. CDS from 205 archaea genomes were downloaded from EMBL. the analysis was based on CDSs from the following assemblies. 186 protist genomes were downloaded from the Ensembl database. non-NTG start codons are too rare for meaningful analysis. for eukaryotes, only ATG starts were allowed. n can take any value from 1 to the length of the longest gene. CDSs from S. flexneri were queried against the local database. if there was more than one match, the ortholog with the lowest expected value (E) and percentage match was chosen. a fourth site A in E. coli is more resilient to change. a reference set of CDSs was selected to represent the highly expressed genes. only genomes with annotations for 20 of these genes were considered. CAI values for the remaining genes within the genome were calculated. G\u00b0 describes the change in free energy required to bring the mRNA strand together with the identified 16S rRNA tail. for each CDS, a 60-nucleotide window centered on the start codon was extracted. the position with minimal G\u00b0 was considered the optimal binding site. compared with the average frequencies compared with all positions in the CDS, using the formula A O D x = n ( f x - F x ) n, (2) where A O D x = average of difference score for amino acid x, f x = frequency of amino acid x across all amino acids and n = number of CDSs. Genomes were further categorized equally into low (GC 44.19%), medium (44.19% GC 60.91%) and high algorithm was trained on the E. coli O157 genome to identify leader genes. multivariate analysis was conducted using 134 genomes."}
