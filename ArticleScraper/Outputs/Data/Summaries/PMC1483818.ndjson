{"summary": "amphotropic murine leukemia virus (A-MLV) can enter the mouse fibroblast cell line NIH3T3 via caveola-dependent endocytosis. but due to the size and omega-like shape of caveolae it is possible that A-MLV initially binds cells outside of caveolae. a high amount of cell-bound A-MLV was attached to large rafts of NIH3T3 at the time of investigation. rafts and caveolae are important for their entry and assembly. rafts and caveolae are linked to rafts in infected cells. rafts and caveolae are linked to rafts in infected cells. a large fraction of the A-MLV receptor Pit2 was found associated with cholesterol-rich microdomains. the cells were incubated for 3 hours at 37\u00b0C with fluorescently labeled cholera toxin (CTX) this is a standard procedure for staining of cholesterol-rich microdomains since CTX binds specifically to GM1. YFP A-MLV bound to NIH3T3 cells stably expressing a cav-1 mRed fusion protein (red) from these data, we suggest that rafts rather than caveolae are involved in early steps of A-MLV binding. rafts rather than caveolae are involved in early steps of A-MLV binding. large cholesterol-rich microdomains were present in cells incubated with both VSV and A-MLV. the same was true for NIH3T3 cells incubated with viral like particles lacking viral envelope proteins. however, binding of A-MLV to large raft regions did not lead to the formation of large rafts. NIH3T3 cells were treated with 10 mM methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MBCD) the cells were incubated with GagYFP A-MLV for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. after this treatment, the cells were washed, fixed, and stained for GM1 using fluorescently labeled CTX. large rafts in NIH3T3 cells are not a result of A-MLV binding. large rafts were not present in other cell lines like 293T (human kidney cell line) or MDTF (Mus dunni tail fibroblasts) regardless of A-MLV binding. raft patching in NIH3T3 cells induced by pronounced protein-protein interactions would indeed explain the resistance of these large domains to extraction of plasma membrane cholesterol with MBCD. it is likely that a complex and rigid protein network could preserve large rafts from disintegration even in the absence of cholesterol. cell-bound A-MLV particles associated with large rafts within 30 minutes of virus exposure suggest that rafts are involved in early events of A-MLV binding. this suggests that transport of A-MLV from rafts to caveolae is a limiting step in A-MLV entry. 293T cells were seeded in T75 flasks and grown to 70% confluence. the cells were transiently co-transfected with a Gag-YFP construct. the cells were transiently co-transfected with a Gag-YFP construct. confocal images were captured with a leica TCS SP confocal microscope. YFP and Rhodamine were excited individually using argon laser 488 nm line and green helium neon laser 543 nm line. 293T cells were seeded in T75 flasks and grown to 70% confluence. the cells were transiently co-transfected with a Gag-YFP construct. the cells were encoding viral structural proteins and an YFP-tagged nucleocapsid protein [12], pHIT111 and a pHIT derived vector. the confocal images were captured with a leica TCS SP confocal Microscope (Leitz) yFP and Rhodamine were excited individually using argon laser 488 nm line and green helium neon laser 543 nm line. brightness and contrast were adjusted."}
