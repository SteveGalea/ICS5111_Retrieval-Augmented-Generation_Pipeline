{"summary": "henipavirus uses HS for trans-infection. we first asked whether leukocytes could capture HeV and transmit it to susceptible cells in trans without becoming infected themselves. trans-infection requires expression of HS. CHO cells (8) are resistant to henipavirus infection due to lack of entry receptors EFN-B2 and -B3 (7). the treatment of CHO-K1 cells with heparinase 3 inhibited their trans-infection properties by >90%. the treatment of CHO-K1 cells with heparinase 3 inhibited their trans-infection properties by >90%. heparin is a competitive inhibitor of henipavirus trans-infection. heparin reduced the trans-infection property of PBLs and CHO-K1 cells by 80% and 90%. both pretreatment and posttreatment with heparin were effective in inhibiting human PBL-mediated trans-infection of either NiV or HeV. results are expressed as a percentage of inhibition compared to results in untreated cells, the SD. soluble heparin was able to compete and inhibit NiV-pseudotyped binding to immobilized HP or HS by SPR. heparin, chondroitin sulfate A, CS-C, and DS, were devoid of inhibition properties. we analyzed HP binding of pseudotyped NiV expressing either NiV-F or -F. significantly more binding was obtained with NiV-G than with NiV-F. results were further confirmed using HeLa cells transfected with either NiV-G or -F. HS plays a role in henipavirus infection. vero cells were either treated with heparinase 3 or left untreated prior to NiV infection. titration was performed 3 days later in a plaque assay. heparin inhibits infection and limits viral binding to EFN-B2 and -B3. this effect may be the consequence of direct heparin binding to heparin. heparin inhibits infection and limits viral binding to heparin. heparin treatment restricts Nipah virus infection in animals. heparin binds and activates anti-thrombin III (AT-III) through a specific pentasaccharide sequence. heparin lacking anticoagulant activity by using periodate oxidation. we tested its antiviral properties in the golden hamster model of NiV infection. all nontreated animals succumbed to infection in less than 6 days. survival in the group increased moderately (P = 0.017) the CHO cell line K1 and CHO pgsA-745 cells were transfected with human ephrin-B2 and -B3, all generously provided by B. Lee [UCLA, United States] [7] were maintained in F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 U/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg streptomycin, 10 mM HEPES, and 2 mM all cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1, for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. infection virus was used in the INSERM Jean M\u00e9rieux BSL4 laboratory in Lyon, France. DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and sodium chlorate (NaClO3; 25, 50 and 75 mM) for 48 h to inhibit HS sulfation in cells. rapid turnover of proteoglycans in the cells (47) required prolonged incubation with NaClO3. cells were then detached by using trypsin\u20130.05% EDTA, distributed into new 6-well tissue culture plates. SPR experiments were performed on a BIAcore X apparatus (for analysis of cells and pseudotyped viral particles) or a Biacore 3000 apparatus (for pseudotyped viral particles and recombinant ephrin-B3) using CM4 (for pseudotyped virus and recombinant EFN-B3) and CM5 (for cells) sensor chips and HBS-P buffer. HS (Celsus, Cincinnati, OH, United States), HP qPCR was run on the StepOne Plus PCR system (Applied Biosystems) as follows: 95\u00b0C for 5 min and 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s and 60\u00b0. glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene was used as a housekeeping gene to normalize the samples. the results were expressed as the number of mRNA copies of the gene of interest per microgram of analyzed RNA. the sample was resuspended in 800 l of 0.2 M NaBH4 in 0.25 M ammonium bicarbonate. the reaction mixture was neutralized by addition of NaOH (1 M), dialyzed against water, and lyophilized. eight-week-old golden hamsters were anesthetized and infected intraperitoneally."}
