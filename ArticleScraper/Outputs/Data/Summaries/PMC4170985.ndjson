{"summary": "social determinants of health include poverty, race, ethnicity, social marginalization, physical environment, and other factors to infectious diseases. they argue poverty contributes to conditions that cause infectious diseases and subsequently prevent access to health care. one of the few specific references to infectious respiratory diseases in the Closing the Gap report ties poverty to lower access to treatment for acute respiratory infections in sub-Saharan Africa. Blumenshine et al12 drew on a social and health disparities model13 to articulate the potential causes of disparities in the US during an influenza pandemic. they conceptualized that differential exposure to influenza virus, differential susceptibility to disease, and differential access to health care once disease has developed may explain respiratory infection disparities. they explicitly call for action from countries with large subgroups who live in poverty in a weak public infrastructure challenged to meet their needs under normal circumstances. living in an apartment building Number of adults in household Number of children 18 in household Work-Related Measures of Inability to Social Distance Difficulty staying home from work for 7-10 days Not able to work at home Could lose job or business if not able to go to work Job can only be done at workplace Other Measures of Inability to Social Distance Difficulty finding daycare not with a group of children Difficulty avoiding public transportation Measures of Susceptibility Self-Re racial and ethnic minorities are at greater risk in a pandemic because of social factors. multiple epidemiologic studies and reviews have reported higher rates of hospitalization due to 2009 H1N1 pandemic among the poor, those living in poorer neighborhoods, and minorities in the US. based on the findings of Blumenshine et al12 and our own findings, we developed a conceptual model of the potential causes of inequalities in influenza burden. the model builds on that original model by making explicit the proximal (functional) variables of interest and the distal (actionable) determinants of inequalities. in low-income countries, subpopulations lack access to clean water and sanitation, not only putting them at risk for gastrointestinal infections, but also decreasing hand-washing behaviors. stress has also been suggested as a mechanism to explain disparities in influenza rates,12,33,34. ial healthcare seeking behaviors may exist by income, potentially driven by differential access to health care. less access to health care may result in uncontrolled chronic conditions such as asthma and hence more severe disease. planning did not account for people's differential access to water and sanitation or health care, both of which could have large impacts on who is exposed. socioeconomic disparities in access to paid sick days could lead to differential exposure to virus and, hence, disparities in influenza attack rates. in low-income countries, subpopulations lack access to clean water and sanitation, not only putting them at risk for gastrointestinal infections, but also decreasing handwashing behaviors. planning did not account for people's differential access to water and sanitation or health care, both of which could have large impacts on who is exposed and where disease persists. we believe that countries around the world should invest in a preparedness planning process that seeks to decrease inequalities in disease burden during an influenza or other pandemic. groups traditionally disadvantaged and those likely to be disproportionately affected by preparations for an influenza pandemic, responses to a pandemic, and by a pandemic itself. but only 1 of the plans explicitly described how they engaged disadvantaged populations. they argue plans treat pandemics as \u201cequal opportunity\u201d events that are global in nature. studies by Uscher-Pines et al and Garoon and Duggan are disturbing. they reflect some of the gaps at the level of WHO consideration of pandemic planning. in 2013, the WHO Pandemic Influenza Risk Management interim guidance had little to say about socially disadvantaged populations, either by poverty, race, ethnicity, religion, or indigenous status. to include this as a specific focus in efforts to meet GHS objectives is essential to achieving the goals and objectives. Recommendations Goal: Detect threats early including detecting, characterizing, and transparently reporting emerging biological threats early through real-time biosurveillance. Identify and engage socially disadvantaged populations prior to a pandemic and strengthen quantitative and qualitative data systems to foster understanding of the factors affecting them. countries need to use periods between pandemics to examine mechanisms by which unequal levels of disease and mortality may arise. this would include investing in surveillance systems capable not only of detecting outbreaks and novel agents early, but also of capturing sociodemographic information of incident cases. the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response framework has an established matrix of partners and specifies their roles in detection and control of an outbreak. however, attention to inequalities is not identified specifically with any activities or as a role for any partner from community, health system, government, or nongovernment organizations. models that showed that preventing air travel and closing schools would have minimal impact on the size of the epidemic informed policy in the us and other countries. individual-based models can be used to examine the impact of interventions on inequalities. u.s. CDC has articulated its cooperative agreements to increase Vaccine production and its international Influenza Vaccine Donation Partnership. the partnership for international Vaccine Introduction unites WHO, regional offices of WHO, individual countries, the CDC, and industry to develop and sustain vaccine availability in low-income countries. if undertaken, these efforts will yield health and societal benefits beyond the impact on infectious diseases. if undertaken, these efforts will yield health and societal benefits beyond the impact on infectious diseases. if undertaken, these efforts will yield health and societal benefits beyond the impact on infectious diseases."}
