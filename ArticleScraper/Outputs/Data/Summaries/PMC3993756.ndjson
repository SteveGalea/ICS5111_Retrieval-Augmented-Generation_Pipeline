{"summary": "the nucleocapsid carboxy-terminal domain abolished the capacity of the virus to selectively package genomic RNA into assembled virions. both viruses overlap geographically in tropical regions, produce similar fever-like symptoms, and are difficult to diagnose. active enhancers are major targets for MLV vector integration in human CD34+ cells. other oncogenes also are preferential targets of MLV integration. measles vaccination of nonhuman primates confers protection against canine distemper virus. viruses can be developed by targeting common mechanisms used to infect cells."}
