EC50 was estimated to be 90 m based on semi-quantitative analysis by densitometry. itative real time PCR for positive-stranded genomic RNA did not show significant difference between the as1-treated sample and the untreated control collected at 18 hpi. contrast, a remarkable inhibition of As1 on secondary IBV infection was observed at 40 hpi. biot-As1 interacted in vitro with IBV membrane (M) and spike (S) proteins but not nucleocapsid (N) protein. vero cells were treated with biot-As1 at the point of infection by IBV. the cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with NeutrAvidin conjugated to Dylight 488. the cells were stained with rabbit anti-IBV N protein sera. four predominant peptides, named alstotides S1\u2013S4, or As1\u2013As4, were obtained in a scale-up experiment (1 kg of fresh leaves) each purified alstotide was disulfide-reduced and sequenced by tandem MS/MS de novo sequencing. four alstotides as1\u2013As4, along with nine reported CKAIs, provide information on sequence diversity of CKAI family. only four residues are found to be conserved between AAI and other apocynaceous CKAIs. proline was found in loops 1\u20133 of AAI, whereas it is distributed in loops 1, 3 and 4 of apocynaceous CKAIs. reduced As4 was digested by chymotrypsin for different time intervals. reduced As4 was treated in similar conditions to serve as a control. the 1SS and 2SS species were later fully reduced with DTT. the newly reduced half-cystine alkylated with iodoacetamide. each differentially labeled species was digested by chymotrypsin. a highly twisted -sheet formed by three short -strands (residues 6\u20138, 20\u201322, and 27\u201330) was identified in both structures. the most significant backbone differences between As1 and As4 structures occur in loops 2 and 4 (Ile11\u2013Asn13 and Pro23\u2013Pro24, respectively, As1 numbering) the most significant differences occur in Ile11\u2013Asn13 and Pro23\u2013Pro24 segments (As1 numbering). D, wall-eyed stereo images of As1 with four proline residues. a degenerate primer targeting the conserved INQCCDPY motif was used in 3\u2032 RACE PCR. the reaction yielded the complete transcript of As1 precursor, named asc1. a specific primer against the signal peptide of asc1 clone was subsequently used to amplify asc2 and asc4 clones. the pro-domain ranges from 36 residues in asc4 clone to 51 residues in aoc1, aoc4, and aoc5. precursors comprise an endoplasmic reticulum signal sequence, a pro-domain, and a mature cystine knot domain. cell monolayers co-treated with IBV (MOI = 1) were collected at 24 hpi for Western blotting analysis (B) and the supernatant for viral titration by plaque assay (D) the virus proliferation was analyzed using Western blotting for cell monolayers (C) and plaque assay (E) virus stocks were pretreated with 25, 50, 75, and 100 m of peptides. vero cells were inoculated with untreated or peptide-treated IBV at MOI = 1. viral replication was evaluated at 24 hpi. IBV RNA was electroporated into two parallel cultures of Vero cells. as1 (100 m) was added into one of the cultures. viral replication was analyzed at 18 hpi and 40 hpi. as1 (25\u2013100 m) was added to the cell culture at the point of viral infection. the cell lysate was harvested after 2 (RSV A) to 3 days (DENV2) EC50 was estimated to be 90 m. quantitative real time PCR for positive-stranded genomic RNA did not show significant difference between the as1-treated sample and the untreated control collected at 18 and 40 hpi. contrast, a remarkable inhibition of As1 on secondary IBV infection was observed at 40 hpi. a pulldown assay using a biotinylated control peptide was performed. vero cells were treated with biot-As1 at the point of infection by IBV. the cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with NeutrAvidin. the cells were stained with rabbit anti-IBV N protein sera. four predominant peptides, named alstotides S1\u2013S4, or As1\u2013As4, were obtained in a scale-up experiment (1 kg of fresh leaves) each purified alstotide was disulfide-reduced and sequenced by tandem MS/MS. alstotides, allotides, and wrightides share Gln13 in loop 2 and Pro24 in loop 4. CKAIs are resistant to heat and proteolytic degradation. reduced As4 was used as the control in chymotryptic treatment. the results showed that >90% of As1 and As3 survived the heat treatment. reduced As4 was digested by chymotrypsin for different time intervals. each NEM-labeling caused a mass increase of 126 Da. the 1SS and 2SS species were later fully reduced with DTT. the newly reduced half-cystine alkylated with iodoacetamide. the six cysteine residues are bridged in the order of Cys I\u2013IV, Cys II\u2013V, and Cys III\u2013VI, where Cys III\u2013VI is the penetrating linkage. the most significant backbone differences between As1 and As4 structures occur in loops 2 and 4 (Ile11\u2013Asn13 and Pro23\u2013Pro24, respectively, as1 numbering) sequence logo shows conserved residues among CKAIs. the most significant differences occur in Ile11\u2013Asn13 and Pro23\u2013Pro24 segments (As1 numbering) d Alstotide-rich peptides, such as cyclotides, are encoded by genes with diverse precursor structures. previously we showed that allotides and wrightides contain three domains in their precursors (1, 6). to determine whether alstotide genes share the same organization with other CKAIs, we isolated and sequenced alstotide clones. precursors known so far showed that their signal peptide and the mature peptide are highly conserved, whereas the pro-domain is variable in size. the pro-domain ranges from 36 residues in asc4 clone to 51 residues in aoc1, aoc4, and aoc5. cell monolayers co-treated with IBV (MOI = 1) and peptides were collected at 24 hpi for Western blotting analysis (B) and the supernatant for viral titration by plaque assay (D) antiviral assay was performed using a pretreatment protocol. virus stocks were pretreated with 25, 50, 75, and 100 m of peptides. vero cells were inoculated with untreated or peptide-treated IBV. all as1-treated samples showed significant reduction in synthesis of S, M, and N proteins as compared with the control (p 0.01). the synthesis of M protein in sample E was analyzed at 18 hpi and 40 hpi. as1 (25\u2013100 m) was added to the cell culture at the point of viral infection. the cell lysate was harvested after 2 (RSV A) to 3 days. EC50 was estimated to be 90 m based on semi-quantitative analysis by densitometry. biot-As1 immobilized on NeutrAvidin beads to pull-down viral proteins from IBV-infected cell lysate. a pulldown assay using a biotinylated control peptide was performed. the results showed that the control peptide did not pull down S protein. ally pulls down membrane-associated IBV proteins. it is therefore of interest to determine the cell permeability of alstotides using as1. the cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with NeutrAvidin. the 30-residue apocynaceous CKAIs are currently the smallest -amylase inhibitors known to date (1). the solution structures of As1 and As4 determined in this study provide insights into the conserved structural features of CKAIs from the Amaranthaceae and Apocynaceae families. nes suggests that alstotides and other CKAIs have evolved from recent gene duplication and mutation events within plant species. the divergent process through duplication and mutation is an efficient mechanism adopted by many plants for better adaptation to environmental challenges. sequence and loop length differences in loop 2 of AAI (8 residues) and Wr-AI1 (5 residues) may lead to the presence of a short -helix turn in this loop (Pro10\u2013Asp13) of the amaranthaceous AAI and its absence in the apocynaceous CKAIs. alstotides has been plagued by many unsatisfactory therapeutic characteristics. they have poor oral bioavailability, high cytotoxicity, and off target effects. as1 was identified as a moderate early acting anti-IBV drug, as supported by three lines of evidence. cytotoxic nature still makes it a potential candidate for anti-IBV drugs. Upon biotinylation, biot-As1 exhibited a significant decrease in antiviral activity. CKAIs and other cystine knot peptides are known for their remarkably stable structures rigidified by three interlaced disulfide bonds. it is unlikely that their structure will be significantly changed by a biotin group covalently bonded to the extended N terminus. lated As1 can gain entry into both infected and noninfected cells. it may interact with IBV proteins during viral protein translation and viral particle assembly. the polyclonal anti-IBV M antiserum available is not suitable for such a study. conserved gene structure and high sequence homology of CKAIs within the apocynaceae family suggest that the CKAI gene existed in the ancestral Apocynaceae species before differentiation events leading to the emergence of diverse CKAI-producing species. the pro-domain, believed to aid in the biosynthesis of mature CKAI domain rather than playing any major function, undergoes significant changes. the presence of the conserved cis-Pro18 in loop 3 has become a defining feature of all CKAIs so far. cis-proline is typically stabilized by parallel stacking of its pyrrolidine ring and the aromatic side chain of the following Tyr or Trp residue (distance in the range of 5. the time of drug addition assay revealed a significant drop of activity when As1 was added at 3 hpi, implicating an antiviral mechanism upstream of genomic replication and gene expression. the time of drug addition assay revealed a significant drop of activity when As1 was added at 3 hpi, implicating an antiviral mechanism. biotin moiety was linked to biot-As1 via an aliphatic aminohexanoic acid spacer. a preliminary attempt to map this interaction excludes the possibility of As1 binding to the glycosylation group of M protein. this association suggests that As1 may elicit weak inhibition on IBV assembly and/or budding process. a phase 1 intron is present in the middle of the signal peptide in genomic sequences. this gene organization suggests that alstotides are synthesized as larger precursors that will be N-terminally processed by SPase I to remove the signal peptide. homology was found between acs1 and acs2 clones. CKAIs share several conserved features: 1) they all adopt a cystine knot fold; 2) their backbones are well aligned and accommodate three short antiparallel -strands connected mainly by -turns. despite these variations, CKAIs share several conserved features. the presence of the conserved cis-Pro18 in loop 3 has become a defining feature of all CKAIs so far. this cis-proline is typically stabilized by parallel stacking of its pyrrolidine ring and the aromatic side chain of the following Tyr or Trp residue (distance in the range of 5. as1 binds to IBV fusion glycoprotein, S protein, which plays a vital role during viral entry. it is therefore possible that the putative antiviral mechanism of As1 is through its interference with S protein function during IBV entry. however, its noncytotoxic nature still makes it a potential candidate for anti-IBV drugs. a preliminary attempt to map this interaction excludes the possibility of As1 binding to the glycosylation group of M protein. the as1-M protein association suggests that As1 may elicit weak inhibition on IBV assembly and/or budding process. this hypothesis is supported by a positive effect observed in the time of drug addition assay when As1 was added from 3 hpi onwards. homology was found between acs1 and acs2 clones. this suggests that alstotides and other CKAIs have evolved from recent gene duplication and mutation events within plant species. CKAIs show a high structural tolerance to amino acid sequence. despite these variations, CKAIs share several conserved features. the presence of the conserved cis-Pro18 in loop 3 has become a defining feature of all CKAIs so far. alstotides have been plagued by many unsatisfactory therapeutic characteristics. they generally have poor oral bioavailability, high cytotoxicity, and off target effects. this study provides insights into possible antiviral mechanisms of alstotides against IBV infection on vero cells. biot-As1 exhibited a significant decrease in antiviral activity upon biotinylation. CKAIs and other cystine knot peptides are known for their remarkably stable structures rigidified by three interlaced disulfide bonds. the biotin moiety was linked to As1 via an aliphatic aminohexanoic acid spacer. a preliminary attempt to map this interaction excludes the possibility of As1 binding to the glycosylation group of M biot-As1 can gain entry into both infected and noninfected cells. it may interact with IBV proteins during viral protein translation and viral particle assembly, as well as maturation and release."}
