{"summary": "the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system is widely used as a strategy in the search for the etiology of infectious diseases and autoimmune disorders. the distribution of HLA class I and II alleles in case and control groups was examined for the presence of an association to a genetic susceptibly or resistance to SARS coronavirus infection. up until recently, no probable SARS patients were reported among indigenous peoples. a further significant increase of the allele was seen in the \"Severe cases\" patient group. the results appeared to indicate association of HLA-B* 4601 with the severity of SARS infection. between march 19 and may 22, 2003, 93 cases of suspected SARS were reported. among 680 probable SARS cases reported in Taiwan, 71 (10.4%) cases were admitted. 63 EDTA blood samples from fever patients were collected in our hospitals. /07 2402 1513 4601 0403/06 1202 4* 1101/02 1101/02 4001 4601 0901 1401/07 5 1101/02 3303 4601 5801 0403/06 0901 0601 1401/07 5 1101/02 3303 4601 5801 0403/06 0901 6 0201/07 1101/02 4601 5502 0901 0901 0901 0901 7 1101/02 1101/02 4601 5401 1101/04 1501/02 8 0201/07 31 0201/07 0301 0702 4601 1101/04 1501/02 32 0301 2402 0702 5502 1401/07 1501/02 33* 0201/07 4601 4601 0901 1405 34 0201/07 1101/02 4601 4001 0901 1501/02 35 0201/07 1101/02 5401 1502 0405/10 1401/07 36 0201/07 1101/02 5401 4001 0405/10 1401/07 37 1101/02 1101/02 4001 1502 1401/07 in control B, HLA-A and B were defined by serological methods. data were re-analyzed after converting allotypes of probable SARS patients to their serological equivalents [8]. no corrected P-values (Pc-values) were significant. 27 probable SARS cases were tested for Chlamydia pneumoniae, C. psittaci and C. trachomatis. 15 cases were also tested for Legionella pneumophilia serogroup 1 antigen. bable SARS was declared upon exclusion of all other possible causes. 33 cases of \"probable SARS patients\" and 28 \"Excluded fever patients\" were retained for the analysis. controls control A Blood samples were obtained from 62 health care workers. for HLA-A, B and DRB1 loci was performed using PCR amplification followed by sequence-specific oligonucleotide probing (PCR-SSOP), (Dynal Biotech Ltd; Wirral, U.K.). Statistical analysis HLA class I and class II allele frequencies were estimated by direct counting assuming there was no blanks. risk of introducing bias in estimating probability (P-value) and wrongly accepting association (type I error) was corrected using 37 cases (table 1) were diagnosed as probable SARS cases according to updated WHO case definition for SARS (revised May 1, 2003) only the first infected patient in each family was retained for the analysis giving a final count of 33 probable SARS patients. nine unrelated individuals (cases 7, 13, 18, 19, 21, 22, 26, 27, and 31) were infected from the same source. cases 31 and 32; cases 33 and 34 are mother. case 35 is the father of cases 36 and 37 * Fatal cases and one severe respiratory failure patient who survived after intubation (case 33). the 37 patients diagnosed as probable SARS cases were as follows: 92% (34 cases) showed diffuse infiltration of both lungs and 8% (3 cases) showed only solitary lung lesion. 65% (24 cases) showed at least one positive test result for SARS-CoV RNA by RT-PCR [2] or by real time PCR. 27 probable SARS cases tested for Chlamydia pneumoniae, C. psittaci and C. trachomatis. only two cases tested positive; 15 cases also tested for Legionella pneumophilia serogroup 1 antigen. 62 health care workers included in control A (table 2) and had followed vigorous measures against infection. another 39 blood samples from non-infected health care workers were added to control A. 101 high risk non-infected health care workers were retained as control A. allele typing for control B, HLA-A, B class I was performed by serological methods only [3] for control B, HLA-A, B class I typing was performed by allele typing as described below for the other groups. allele typing was performed on 37 probable SARS cases, 28 fever patients of suspected SARS, and 101 health care workers (control A) exposed or possibly exposed to SARS coronavirus. analysis between 33 retained unrelated probable SARS cases, 28 excluded fever patients, and two control groups (table 2) showed weak association to infection of HLA class I alleles. control A and control B showed elevated odds ratios (OR = 0.16, P = 0.03, Pc = n.s. and OR = 0.16, P = 0.02, Pc = n.s., respectively) the 33 probable SARS patients also included 6 severe cases among whom three were patients who had been intubated for mechanical ventilation. d 4 F 43 B* 4001, B* 4601 None Died 22 M 91 B* 4001, B* 8101 Chronic renal insufficiency, peptic ulcer, coronary heart disease Died 33 F 50 B* 4601, B* 4601 None Intubated, survived Discussion HLA-B gene was found to be associated with susceptibility or protection from infection. in ethnic Thai, HLA-A and B alleles were confirmed to be associated with disease severity and clinical outcome of exposure to a susceptibly of HLA-B* 5401/B54 or B* 3901/B39 could not be concluded upon (Pc = n.s.) and requires further studies. HLA-B13 is widely distributed throughout Asia [18] where it is mostly represented by HLA-B* 1301 (4\u201330%) and rarely by B* 1302 (0\u20132%) the probable SARS cases in this report consist mostly of southern Chinese origin Taiwanese (non indigenous peoples) the presence or absence of HLA-B* 4601 in a population appeared to be an important element that acted during the outbreak of the SARS epidemic. the effects of HLA alleles on the resistance or susceptibility to SARS coronavirus infection was shown to be associated to class I alleles. the results of such screening would help hospitals to better guard their personals against infection, make the workplace safer, and ease the tension and anxiety seen in the hospital environment."}
