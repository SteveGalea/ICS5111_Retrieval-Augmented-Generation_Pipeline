{"summary": "respiratory tract infections (RTI) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide especially in developing countries (1,2). most prevalent presentations in RTI include sore throat, headache and myalgia. the mixture was incubated in 22\u00b0 C for 10 min, 37\u00b0 C for 45 min and 94\u00b0 C for 5 min. PCRs Three multiplex RT-PCR methods, targeting eight respiratory viruses, were developed. thoat swabs and washes were collected from 897 patients with respiratory illness. cDNA synthesis was carried out in 30 l reaction mixture containing 6 L of 5X RT Buffer, 2.5 L of mixed dNTPs (2.5m each), 1 L of RT-MULV enzyme (Fermentase), 2.5 L Random hexamer (Fermentase), 2.5 LRNase Inhibitor (Fermentase) and PCRs Three multiplex RT-PCR methods were developed. multiplex PCR I for RSV and hMPV, multiplex PCR II for PIV1-4 and multiplex PCR III for flu A and B were performed. the proportions of patients aged 12, 12-24, 25-36, 37-48, 49-60 and 61-72 months were 16.3, 10.89, 2.97, 4.45, 3.46 and 6.93% respectively. female sex was more frequently associated with RSV, PIV-1, IFV and hMPV in contrast. the proportions of patients aged 12, 12-24, 25-36, 37-48, 49-60 and 61-72 months were 16.3, 10.89, 2.97, 4.45, 3.46 and 6.93% respectively. female sex was more frequently associated with RSV, PIV-1, IFV and hMPV in contrast to males. fever (53.6%) myalgia (49.8%) and cough (38.4%) were common clinical findings. the pattern of the respiratory virus activity seems to change within the different age groups with different demographic characteristics (13). in each community, the epidemiology of respiratory viruses has to be determined prior to the implementation of novel and costly therapies. female dominance had been seen in these children with fever, myalgia and cough. hMPV was first identified in 2001 in children with respiratory tract disease. studies have reported high co-infection rates with these two viruses. monitoring is necessary in a broader population and for a longer period of time. continuous monitoring of ARTI etiology could be a useful means of planning resources necessary for the development of new vaccines and antiviral agents."}
