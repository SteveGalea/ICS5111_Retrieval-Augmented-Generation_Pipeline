{"summary": "the gastrointestinal microbiome, composed of more than 100 trillion microorganisms, is the most extensively studied. the epithelial surface of the lower respiratory tract has historically been described as sterile. this incorrectly held doctrine arose primarily because of the challenge of directly sampling the lower airways and the limitations of bacterial culture. viruses and bacteria can induce alveolar epithelial cell damage and apoptosis, and modulate host response to injury. mutations in the MUC5B gene encode a mucin required for normal macrophage function and effective muco-ciliary clearance of bacteria in mice [7] is associated with an increased risk of developing both familiar and sporadic IPF [8]. cohort of 6150 patients infected with HCV, Arase and colleagues observed a 10-year and 20-year cumulative incidence of IPF compared to no cases of IPF in a control group of 2050 patients with hepatitis B virus (p = 0.02). the risk of developing IPF was particularly high among heavy smokers, individuals older than 55 years and patients with liver cirrhosis. HHV-infected epithelial cells from patients with familial IPF have evidence of endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis. HHV-infected epithelial cells from patients with familial IPF have evidence of endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis. zoni and colleagues used ultra-deep 16S rRNA gene sequencing to characterize the microbiota of the upper (by using oropharyngeal swabs) and lower (by using BAL fluid) respiratory tracts from 18 patients with ILD (five with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP), six with non-IIP ILD and seven with sarcoidosis) the authors established the presence of a lower airway microbiota, dominated by Pre molyneaux and colleagues prospectively explored the lung microbiomes of patients with IPF. they demonstrated a statistically significant, two-fold higher bacterial burden in the BAL of patients with IPF (n = 65) compared to patients with COPD (n = 17) or healthy controls (n = 27) burden has now been independently validated by the COMET authors. the findings strengthen the association with bacterial burden and survival in IPF. changes in bacterial burden were also associated with a reduction of microbial diversity, often associated with disease. host-microbiome interactions have been shown to influence fibroblast responsiveness and progression-free survival. authors then employed a mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis. this suggests that lung dysbiosis precedes the development of fibrosis. studies investigating the role of chronic infection as either an etiologic agent or co-factor in the development of IPF have focused primarily on viruses. the risk of developing IPF was particularly high among heavy smokers, individuals older than 55 years and patients with liver cirrhosis. a number of studies have reported an increased frequency of EBV in lung biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples from patients with IPF compared to controls. the sequence of the herpes virus saimiri gene extracted from an IPF sample matched 100% with the published viral sequence. HHV-infected epithelial cells from patients with IPF have evidence of endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis. ulomatosis (WG) (n = 33) and IPF (n = 22), and healthy controls (n = 8). authors observed pathogen growth (e.g., Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis) in 8/22 (36%) IPF patients the presence of a specific Streptococcus sp. or Staphylococcus sp. (OUT 1348) was strongly associated with disease progression, defined as a composite of death, acute exacerbation, lung transplant or relative decline in FVC 10% or DLCO 15% over 48 weeks. over the study period, 36/55 (65%) patients experienced disease progression. authors identified increased reads of potentially pathogenic haemophilus, Streptococcus, Neisseria and Veillonella spp. in IPF patients compared to healthy controls. they were unable to identify any bacterial community structure or composition, which differed between IPF patients with stable or progressive disease. the causal significance of an altered lung microbiome in IPF remains elusive. host-microbiome interactions have been shown to influence fibroblast responsiveness and progression-free survival. authors then employed germ-free conditions to study the impact of the microbiome in this model. kitsios and colleagues found a surprisingly low bacterial signal in the subpleural lower lobes of lung explants from end-stage patients with IPF. the low signals in IPF patients were similar to those of negative controls and in striking contrast with the abundance of pathogens identified in cystic fibrosis lung explants. 4/43 patients tested positive for common respiratory viruses (e.g., parainfluenza (n = 1), rhinovirus (n = 2) and coronavirus (n = 1)) no viruses were detected in the BAL fluid from stable patients (n = 40) weng and colleagues used culture-independent techniques to explore changes in the BAL microbiota from patients with stable IPF (n = 15) and subjects experiencing AE-IPF (n = 20) despite negative BAL bacterial cultures, the bacterial burden of patients with AE-IPF was over four times higher than that of patients with stable disease. co-trimoxazole treatment improved FVC; shuttle walk distance with reduced oxygen desaturation during exercise; MRC dyspnoea score; and SGHRQ symptom score. a larger, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of oral co-trimoxazole twice daily for 12 months in addition to usual treatment in patients with fibrotic IIP. in oxygen therapy and a significant reduction in mortality in the co-trimoxazole group. the authors speculated that the reduced mortality in the co-trimoxazole group could be due to a reduction in the rate of respiratory infection. a retrospective observational study compared the number of non-elective hospitalizations and antibiotic courses in the 12 months preceding and following treatment initiation. both hospital admissions (seven versus 31) and antibiotic courses (40 versus 176) were significantly lower in the year after institution of prophylactic azithromycin. the mechanism/s (antibacterial or anti-inflammatory) by which macrolides reduce the risk of hospitalization events. 25 patientsAge 18 years, IPF diagnosis, symptoms of cough NCT02173145 Study of Clinical Efficacy of Antimicrobial Therapy Strategy Using Pragmatic Design in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (cleanUp-IPF) Phase III, randomized, un-blinded, multi-centreTrimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole (T/S) 160/800 mg twice daily OR doxycicline 100 mg/d if T there is clear cross-talk between the two compartments (the \u201cgut\u2013lung axis\u201d) and manipulation of the gut microbiome, by changes in diet or drugs, can alter the microbiome of the lung. direct seeding of bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract into the airways may play a role in shaping the respiratory microbiome. the existence of a gut\u2013lung axis perpetuates this vicious circle. specific microbiota strains may also benefit fibrotic lung disease by restoring the integrity and efficiency of the lung microbiome. would be even more challenging."}
