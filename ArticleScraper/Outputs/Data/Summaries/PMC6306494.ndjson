{"summary": "inflammation is referred to as meningitis (meninges), encephalitis (brain), myelitis (spinal cord), or meningoencephalitis and encephalomyelitis if multiple sites are afflicted. encephalitis is associated with clinical evidence of neurological dysfunctions, which range from behavioral changes to seizures and paralysis. tools to unravel activation, effector function and regulation of protective immune responses within the CNS. these include Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Sindbis virus, west Nile virus, Theiler's encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) both viruses are characterized by an acute encephalomyelitis which resolves into a persistent infection characterized by demyelination and sustained detection of viral v2.2-1 infects ependymal cells lining the ventricles before spreading to microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. peak virus replication around day (d) 5 post-infection correlates with activation of astrocytes and microglia, disruption of the blood brain barrier (BBB) and CNS recruitment of neutrophils, NK cells and predominantly bone marrow derived monocytes. induction of innate immune responses, including type I IFNs, provides the first critical line of immune defense in stemming viral spread throughout the CNS (16, 17) uncontrolled viral replication, extensive viral dissemination throughout the CNS, and expanded tropism to neurons coincided with rapid mortality (18, 19). oligodendrocytes (OLG) are poor inducers of IFN/ relative to microglia. low expression of IFN/ receptor chains coincide with reduced and delayed expression of interferon sensitive genes (ISG) encoding factors with anti-viral activity. analysis using the v2.2-1 virus will determine whether the astrocytic contribution to IFNAR mediated protection remains similar in a model with sparse astrocyte infection. more studies using conditional ablation of IFNAR and selected ISGs will be beneficial in unraveling the importance of autocrine and paracrine protective IFN/ effects on subsequent adaptive responses. v2.2-1 control required both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. mice deficient in perforin-mediated cytolysis could not control viral replication in microglia and astrocytes. virus control in oligodendrocytes (OLG) was unaffected. 4+ T cells express higher levels of IFN mRNA at the population levels than CD8+ T cells (38). CD4+ T cells can indeed mediate direct anti-viral activity. however, adoptive transfer of perforin- or IFN-deficient CD4+ T cells into infected recipients revealed that viral control was independent of either anti-viral function. enhanced OLG infection in the absence of IFNR signaling in OLG did not result in increased demyelination even in the presence of intact T cell function. the role of IFN in demyelination remains unresolved. more in depth analysis of the role of IFN is expected to reveal a better understanding of IFN as a major regulator of inflammation by promoting MHC class II and iNOS expression. iNOS upregulation and oxidative damage have been implicated as factors contributing to CNS tissue damage during demyelination. IL-10 is upregulated during acute v2.2-1 infection, at which time it is produced by CD4+ and to a lesser extent CD8+ T cells (51). IL-10 deficiency was also associated with sustained MHC class II expression on Iba1+ myeloid cells and increased iNOS levels in lesions. mice deficient in IL-27 signaling (IL-27R/) infected with v2.2-1 showed significantly reduced Tr1 cells as anticipated. impaired IL-27R signaling also correlated with decreased demyelination distinct from the IL-10/ infected mice. a small population of virus-specific Foxp3 Tregs was detected in both CLN and CNS. they effectively regulated the pro-inflammatory T cell response at both sites (62). a correlation with potential expansion of demyelinated lesions was not evaluated. peak virus load in the hippocampus coincides with peak expression of IL-10, IL-10ra, and relates genes. increased accumulation of Foxp3 Tregs and arginase-1 expressing microglia/macrophages suggested unsuccessful efforts of the host to compensate for the abrogated IL-10 signaling. il-10 signaling also protects from CNS damage in mice infected with a virulent strain of the mosquito borne alphavirus Sindbis virus by mit encephalomyelitis is the protective activities of IFN/ signaling in limiting initial viral dissemination. the immune response also actively contributes to bystander damage manifested in glia and neuronal dysfunction or demyelination associated with axonal damage. Mutations in IL-10Ra have also been identified as a risk factor of severe influenza-associated encephalopathy (77). innate response promotes virus-specific T cell recruitment and anti-viral activity critical to eliminate infectious virus below detection limits. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells exhibit uncharacterized anti-viral activity. the availability of conditional knockout mice blocking cytokine responses in distinct cell types will shed more light on pathways ameliorating pathology while preserving viral control. similar pathways in multiple viral encephalomyelitis models will ultimately enhance targeted treatment options at early stages of disease manifestation."}
