{"summary": "glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is the most common enzyme deficiency worldwide. in the united states, it is present in about 10% of African American males. medical history was admitted to the hospital as a transfer from another facility. he denied a history of trauma, strenuous activity, sick contacts, recent travel, or ingestion of any medication or fava beans. he endorsed using marijuana but denied cigarette smoking, alcohol, or other recreational drugs. blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 14 mg/dL (6 - 20), bicarbonate 21 mmol/L (22 - 29), total bilirubin 4.8 mg/dL (0.0 - 1.2), direct bilirubin 2.1 mg/dL (0.0 - 0.3), indirect bilirubin 2.7 mg/dL (0 - 1.0), aspartate amino transaminase (AST) 247 U/L (0 - 39), CK peaked at 373,240 U/L, creatinine rose to 2.3 mg/dl, BUN at 31 mg/dL, total bilirubin at 18 mg/dL, and direct bilirubin at 16 mg/dL. initial workup at our institution revealed a hemoglobin of 7.7 g/dL, WBC count 9.17 x 109/L, platelet count 164 x 109/L, reticulocyte 2.2% rhabdomyolysis followed by acute hemolytic anemia and renal failure. a peripheral blood smear showed blister cells and a G6PD activity assay confirmed the G6PD deficiency. hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, and seizures were unlikely in our patient. rhabdomyolysis usually manifests 24 - 72 hours after exposure to oxidant stress. it is plausible the metabolic acidosis induced by acute renal failure precipitated his acute hemolysis. muscle cells possess alternate enzymes, such as catalase and superoxide dismutase, which are absent in erythrocytes. skeletal muscles have lower levels of catalase and superoxide dismutase compared to other tissues and have some dependency on glutathione to remove reactive oxidative radicals. oxidative stress needs to be very large in order to overwhelm glutathione and alternative pathways and cause muscle damage. the other case was a two-year-old AA male with SCT diagnosed with a G6PD deficiency after he developed rhabdomyolysis and acute hemolysis on exposure to a mothball. in these two cases, G6PD deficiency in concert with SCT likely precipitated rhabdomyolysis and hemolysis."}
