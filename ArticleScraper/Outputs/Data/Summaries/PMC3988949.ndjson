ApoD is expressed in a variety of organs, with high levels of expression being found in the testes, peripheral nerves, the brain, and the spinal cord. it is most abundant in plasma, with the concentration in human plasma being approximately 100 times higher than in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) ApoD is not a classical \u201cintegral\u201d apolipoprotein embedded in lipoprotein particles. it is believed to be inserted into the lipid envelope of the HDL particle or cell membranes. the physiological orientation of ApoD might thus appear to resemble a cup. molecular dynamics analyses suggest that binding of AA and its derivatives to ApoD occurs in a rather flexible manner at the opening of the ligand binding pocket of ApoD. the principal binding site of AA in ApoD seems to differ from the binding site of progesterone, which was shown to lie deeply buried in the binding pocket. overexpression of human ApoD in a mouse model of myocardial infarction has been shown to result in reduced levels of lipid peroxidation and increased resistance to oxidative stress. it is of note that ApoD was recently identified as a major cardioprotective protein in a mouse model of myocardial infarction. lipocalins arose in gram-negative bacteria and were passed on to primordial eukaryotes by horizontal gene transfer. lipocalins have undergone a remarkable radiation in chordates and in particular in mammals. only a small number of lipocalins have been identified in arthropods and plants. the protein sequence of human ApoD is 25.2% identical to GLaz, 31.3% identical to NLaz, and 26.0% identical to Lazarillo. the sequence identity between human ApoD and its closest paralog, human RBP4, is only 23.0% (http://www.uniprot.org/). the highest sequence conservation is found in the beta sheets. these hydrophobic loops (blue) are assumed to be involved in defining the ligand specificity and also to facilitate the interaction of ApoD and Lazarillo proteins with hydrophobic surfaces. lipocalins are phylogenetically old proteins found in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. lipocalins are subdivided on the basis of the number of these SCRs present into core lipocalins harboring 3 SCRs. lipocalins are subdivided on the basis of the number of these SCRs present into core lipocalins harboring 3 SCRs. ApoD is expressed in a variety of organs, with high levels of expression being found in the testes, peripheral nerves, the brain, and the spinal cord. it is most abundant in plasma, with the concentration in human plasma being approximately 100 times higher than in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) ApoD is not a classical \u201cintegral\u201d apolipoprotein embedded in lipoprotein particles. it associates peripherally with lipoprotein particles. the physiological orientation of ApoD might thus appear to resemble a cup with its opening facing toward the lipid surface and its base forming a spike that could interact with a transmembrane receptor. molecular dynamics analyses suggest that binding of AA and its derivatives to ApoD occurs in a rather flexible manner at the opening of the ligand binding pocket of ApoD. the principal binding site of AA in ApoD thus seems to differ from the binding site of progesterone, which was shown to lie deeply buried in the binding pocket. overexpression of human ApoD in the mouse has, in contrast, been shown to result in reduced levels of lipid peroxidation and increased resistance to oxidative stress. it is of note that ApoD was recently identified as a major cardioprotective protein in a mouse model of myocardial infarction. phylogeny of ApoD Lipocalins belongs to the most ancient group of lipocalins. arose in gram-negative bacteria and were passed on to primordial eukaryotes by horizontal gene transfer. lipocalins have undergone remarkable radiation in chordates and in particular in mammals. calins were derived from early ApoD in a monophyletic manner. the protein sequence of human ApoD is 25.2% identical to GLaz, 31.3% identical to NLaz, and 26.0% identical to Lazarillo. the sequence identity between human ApoD and its closest paralog, human RBP4, is well above 50%. all 3 orthologs have a signal peptide at their N-terminus and a short alpha helix at the C-terminus (cylinder) the highest sequence conservation is found in the beta sheets. the sequence stretches in between often contain hydrophobic residues which in human ApoD were shown to be organized as protruding loops. these hydrophobic loops (blue) are assumed to be involved in defining the ligand specificity and also to facilitate the interaction of Ap human ApoD has a cysteine residue in the hydrophobic region at the entrance to the ligand-binding pocket. it forms an intermolecular disulfide bond with the HDL-associated apolipoprotein A2. the association of ApoD with HDL is more stable in humans than any other species. the theory is based on the realization that organisms have a finite metabolic energy budget that must be allocated among somatic maintenance, that is, survival and reproduction. an optimal resource allocation therefore evolved in the form of hard-wired genetic programs that maximize the fitness of an individual. the extent and type of damage that the soma suffers over a lifetime is presumably not homogenous for all parts of the body. oxidative stress is likely to play a major role in the aging brain. the human brain is the organ with the highest energy demand and the highest adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. the idea of ROS being essential drivers of aging was first formulated by Denham Harman. the theory considers ROS to be inevitable by-products of aerobic metabolism. because of inadequate antioxidant defense mechanisms, macromolecular damage accumulates and eventually leads to age-dependent physiological decline. senescence is a fate similar to apoptosis, differentiation, or proliferation. cells survive initially but remain locked in a non-proliferating state. the decision between apoptosis and senescence may depend on the severity of the insult. oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria is the main source of ROS in a cell. the rate of mitochondrial ROS production tends to increase during aging. this mechanism of self-inflicted mitochondrial damage is aggravated by an age-dependent decline in autophagic clearing capacity. elevated levels of ROS are a major stressor in the aging brain. the main cellular sources of ROS are mitochondria; in a vicious cycle ROS damage mitochondrial enzymes. inflict direct chemical damage to cellular macromolecules because of their high reactivity. regulated 6- to 8-fold at the messenger RNA and protein level between the early postnatal period of life and an age of 49 years. up-regulation of ApoD mRNA in the cortex during aging was conserved between human, macaque, and mouse. this study confirms previous results obtained with the mouse. intriguingly, overexpression of human ApoD in Drosophila led to a reduction in age-associated lipid peroxidation, concomitant with an increase in stress resistance and longevity. overexpression of human ApoD in Drosophila thus reproduces the phenotype of overexpression of GLaz. oxidative stress and inflammaging are major drivers of aging in the brain. aging is defined as the persistent decline in Darwinian fitness over an organism's typical lifetime because of internal physiological deterioration. aging is defined as the persistent decline in Darwinian fitness over an organism's typical lifetime because of internal physiological deterioration. the soma invests more metabolic energy in competitive reproduction, at the expense of maintenance and repair. two major questions arise from this theoretical framework are: what is the nature of the damage inflicted on an organism's soma over its lifetime; and what are the defense mechanisms that have evolved to contain this progressive damage. most of the cells in a brain are postmitotic, but telomeric shortening is not considered likely to be a major cause of aging. oxidative stress is likely to play a major role in the aging brain. the brain is the most lipid-rich organ in the body. a new hypothesis on ROS-induced aging has recently been put forward by Sohal and Orr (2012). this new hypothesis shifts the focus from ROS-induced structural damage to ROS-triggered disruption of the redox-regulated signaling pathways. apoptosis has presumably evolved as an alternative to apoptosis for handling insulted cells. the decision between apoptosis and senescence may depend on the severity of the insult. senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) refers to the continued secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and proteases. autophagy is an ancient housekeeping mechanism that controls cellular homeostasis by sequestering aggregated proteins and dysfunctional organelles including mitochondria. damaged mitochondria activate the NRLP3-dependent inflammasome, a protein platform that acts as a sensor of intracellular damage including elevated levels of ROS. the main cellular sources of ROS are mitochondria. evolutionary biology of aging Biological aging has been defined as the persistent decline in Darwinian fitness over an organism's typical lifetime because of internal physiological deterioration. both the chances of survival and the degree of fecundity of a species shrink with increasing age until they reach zero at the end of the species' maximum life span. the soma invests more metabolic energy in competitive reproduction, at the expense of maintenance and repair. two major questions arise from this theoretical framework are: what is the nature of the damage inflicted on an organism's soma over its lifetime; and what are the defense mechanisms that have evolved to contain this progressive damage. the human brain is the organ with the highest energy demand and the highest adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production in the body. ATP production in mitochondria by oxidative phosphorylation is the main source of ROS. the brain is the most lipid-rich organ in the body. a new hypothesis on ROS-induced aging has been put forward by Sohal and Orr (2012). this new hypothesis shifts the focus from ROS-induced structural damage to ROS-triggered disruption of the redox-regulated signaling pathways. a progressive ROS-induced pro-oxidative shift is assumed to occur in the cellular redox state, leading to the over-oxidation of redox-sensitive proteins. senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) refers to the continued secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and proteases. inflammaging seems to be self-propagating through a positive feedback loop or vicious cycle. oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria is the main source of ROS in a cell. autophagy is an ancient housekeeping mechanism that controls cellular homeostasis by sequestering aggregated proteins and dysfunctional organelles including mitochondria. damaged mitochondria consequently accumulate within senescent cells in aged tissue and produce increasing levels of ROS. aging occurs because of a cell's progressive inability to cope with various forms of stress. ApoD is mainly expressed in white matter, within neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes. in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) ApoD is mostly detected in Schwann cells and fibroblasts. a meta-analysis of age-related gene expression profiles involved 27 datasets from mouse, rat, and human. ApoD was found to be the most significant of the age-dependent up-regulated genes in the aging brain including ApoD. overexpression of GLaz in Drosophila resulted in increased resistance to oxidative stress and a marked extension in life span by 30%. mice overexpressing human ApoD in the brain exhibit a reduced rate of lipid peroxidation and an improved rate of survival. loss of GLaz function in Drosophila has been reported to increase lipid peroxidation and sensitivity to oxidative stress. aging is the primary risk factor for a number of neurodegenerative diseases. aging is characterized by elevated levels of stress and chronic inflammation. upregulation of ApoD appears to be a shared response occurring in the aging brain and in the pathologic, degenerative brain. AD is a typical age-related neurodegenerative disease with its incidence and prevalence doubling every 5 years after the age of 65 years. the ultimate cause of AD is a progressive loss of neurons, mostly in the hippocampus and the cerebral cortex. ApoD immunopositive cells within these plaques appear to be reactive microglia, suggesting an inflammation-induced upregulation of ApoD in AD. it remains unclear whether this induction would be direct or indirect, but it is known that A\u00df triggers production of ROS. a causal link between A\u00df and ApoD is also indicated by a mouse model of AD. a substantial decline in MetSO reductase activity has been found in AD brains. in the brains of AD patients ApoD has predominantly been detected as a dimerized aggregate. increased oxidative stress in AD promotes lipid peroxidation. a stroke is the disruption of brain function because of a lack of blood supply. the large majority of strokes are ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes are associated with ischemia in that part of the brain that was fed by the ruptured artery. immunohistochemical studies revealed that ApoD within the infarct core was markedly upregulated by degenerating pyramidal neurons. in the surviving and regenerating peri-infarct region ApoD was localized in mature oligodendrocytes where it remained upregulated for more than 1 week. this extra upregulation of ApoD under enriched housing conditions correlated with an improved rate of functional recovery. ApoD may exert a neuroprotective influence in the acute stroke phase. it may also support neuronal regeneration and remyelination in the extended post-stroke recovery phase. specific differences in neuroanatomic sites of ApoD elevation were found between patients with schizophrenic disorder and those with bipolar disorder. ApoD levels have also been found to be significantly increased in the plasma of schizophrenic patients, including first-episode patients. clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic drug that has been shown to be effective in acute and long-term treatment. leptics have a better treatment outcome in terms of improved cognitive performance. the well-described role that ApoD plays in the transport and modification of lipids may provide an explanation. altered membrane phospholipids are known to be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. polyunsaturated fatty acids are key determinants of membrane order and fluidity and affect the binding and signaling characteristics of membrane proteins. they affect the binding and signaling characteristics of membrane proteins, including ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors. they have been implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and their neuroprotective potential as medication is currently being investigated. AD is a typical age-related neurodegenerative disease with its incidence and prevalence doubling every 5 years after the age of 65 years. the ultimate cause of AD is a progressive loss of neurons, mostly in the hippocampus and the cerebral cortex. ApoD is co-distributed with compact (dense fibrillar) but not diffuse (amorphous), A\u00df plaques. this suggests an inflammation-induced upregulation of ApoD in AD. it remains unclear whether this induction would be direct or indirect. but it is known that A\u00df triggers production of ROS. a substantial decline in enzymatic activity has been found in AD brains. in AD patients ApoD has predominantly been detected as a dimerized aggregate. increased oxidative stress in AD promotes lipid peroxidation and elicits upregulation of ApoD. a series of studies have detected some polymorphisms of the human APOD gene that appear to predispose carriers to AD. however, evidence that certain APOD variants are a risk factor for AD is much less well established than for the 4 allele of APOE. strokes are caused by obstruction of flow in a blood vessel; hemorrhagic stroke, which is caused by the rupture of a blood vessel in the brain. rat, ApoD expression was increased within the first 24 hours in post-ischemic peri-infarct regions, with a further increase 48 hours post-ischemia. in the surviving and regenerating peri-infarct region ApoD was localized in mature oligodendrocytes where it remained upregulated for more than 1 week. this extra upregulation of ApoD under enriched housing conditions correlated with improved rate of functional recovery. ApoD may exert a neuroprotective influence in the acute stroke phase. it may also support neuronal regeneration and remyelination in the extended post-stroke recovery phase. specific differences in neuroanatomic sites of ApoD elevation were found between patients with schizophrenic disorder and those with bipolar disorder. clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic drug that has been shown to be effective in acute and long-term treatment of patients with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. atypical neuroleptics have a better treatment outcome in terms of improved cognitive performance and ameliorated negative symptoms. however, the well-described role that ApoD plays in the transport and modification of lipids may provide an explanation. AA is of particular interest, because this fatty acid is a prominent ligand of ApoD. polyunsaturated fatty acids are key determinants of membrane order and fluidity. they affect binding and signaling characteristics of membrane proteins, including ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors. they have been implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. ApoD appears to play a neuroprotective role in schizophrenia. it is further augmented by treatment with atypical neuroleptics, including clozapine. it may reflect a novel molecular mechanism underlying favorable effects of atypical antipsychotics. omega-3 fatty acids become deficient in the aging and degenerative brain. dietary supplements have been shown to restore their membrane levels. eicosanoids and docosanoids have been shown to be potent anti-inflammatories and antioxidants. atypical neuroleptics induce endogenous ApoD and thereby produce favorable effects in the treatment of psychiatric diseases. exogenously added ApoD may therefore attenuate the progress of a number of neurologic diseases without the deleterious side effects. ApoD modulates AA metabolism in an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant manner. overexpression of ApoD results in an extension of the mean life span in the mouse. endogenous ApoD is upregulated during aging and under a large variety of neurologic and psychiatric disorders."}
