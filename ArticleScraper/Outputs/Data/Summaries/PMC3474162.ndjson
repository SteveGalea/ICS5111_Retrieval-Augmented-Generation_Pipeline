{"summary": "hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections were analysed for a five-year period. the annual rate of occupational infectious diseases (OIDs) per 100,000 employees was calculated. in outbreaks in Hong Kong and Toronto, 62% [8] and 51% [9] of infected patients were HCWs. prevalence of H5/N1 antibodies was five times higher in exposed HCWs than in HCWs without contact to avian influenza patients. the increased risk of infection for HCWs is not always easy to detect. reporting the data on claims of occupational infectious diseases filed by HCWs with the compensation board sheds light on important time trends in work-related health risks. this type of surveillance system can be adopted by other countries with evolving social security systems in order to reduce the disease burden in HCWs. NSIs are documented as working accidents. they must only be reported if they cause sick leave of more than three days. time trends over five years were analysed for claims concerning TB. five-year trends for the most frequent infectious diseases were analysed separately for these working areas. NSIs and ABC were analysed depending on working areas for 2008 and 2009. scabies was the most frequent cause of a claim (38%) number of suspected cases of occupational infectious diseases (OD no. 3101) for 2009 separated by notification requirement, data from BGW, german Occupational infectious diseases (OD no. 3101) Mandatory Not mandatory Total(col %) N (row %) N (row %) Tuberculosis (TB) 311 (40) 472 (60) 783 (26) Hepatitis virus infection (total) 181 (62) 113 (38) 294 (10) Thereof A 4 (57) 3 (43) reports of NSIs increased from 2005 to 2009 by 2% to 5% annually. in 2009, the cost for the compensation board amounted to 380 thousand euros for ABC and 5.36 million euros for NSIs. change from 2008 to 2009; negative change means reduction; positive change means increase. average OID rate per 100,000 employees was highest for this particular infectious disease (1.5/100,000 employees) scabies and active TB also have similar OID rates. in 2009, the rate per 1,000 employees in hospitals was 29.9 for NSIs and 2.8 for ABC. Claims of NSI increased by 2.1% from 2008 to 2009, with the largest rise seen in outpatient care. cases of NSIs and ABCs (slashes) filled to the board increased steadily over the last five years. a US analysis of NSI claims by HCWs eligible to file a state fund workers\u2019 compensation claim in Washington state established that the incidence of NSI claims per 1,000 HCWs employed in hospitals was 15.9, in dental offices 10.5, in physicians\u2019 offices 8.7 and in skilled nursing facilities 8.1. under-representation of HCWs among patients with active TB was also observed in the Hamburg fingerprint study. however, the risk of progression to active TB seems to be lower in HCWs than in close contacts of the general population. LTBI was reported and recognised as an OID more often in 2008 and 2009 than in the years before. the annual incidence of NSI in HCWs of a university hospital was 31.4% [29] compared to the annual rate of 29.9 NSI per 1,000 employees in hospitals. compared to the annual rate of 29.9 NSI per 1,000 employees in hospitals, 10% of the NSI are reported to the compensation board. TB still poses a threat for HCWs and screening for TB should be maintained. trends in NSIs should be observed closely in the following years."}
