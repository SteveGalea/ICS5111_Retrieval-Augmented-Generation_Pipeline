{"summary": "the family Iridoviridae is phylogenetically linked to several other families of nuclear, cytoplasmic, large, DNA-containing viruses. virions range in size from 120\u2013200 nm in diameter, although viruses within the genus Lymphocystivirus may be as large as 300 nm. the unique appearance of infected cells is strong presumptive evidence of iridovirid infection. ranaviruses, megalocytiviruses, and lymphocystiviruses differ from the other two genera by their high level of cytosine methylation.

TFV3 and TFV are nearly identical in nucleotide sequence. iridovirid genomes are not infectious, indicating virion-associated proteins are required to initiate viral gene transcription.

IE and DE proteins include proteins that may play roles in blocking host immune responses. viral homolog of cellular RNA polymerase II (vPOL-II and -II), catalytic proteins that may act to increase dTTP pool sizes and influence host range. proteins non-essential for replication in vivo, but needed for growth in vivo. it is unclear exactly how the genome is encapsidated. virions remain within VAS, accumulate within cytoplasmic paracrystalline arrays, or bud from the plasma membrane. at late times after infection, virions are sometimes seen within the nucleus and elongated tubular structures can be detected in VAS. the identification of virus-encoded proteins involved in virion assembly remains to be determined. iridovirids encode homologs of the two largest subunits of RNA polymerase II (i.e., vPOL-II) and likely use these proteins to catalyze late viral gene expression. vPOL-II, and other viral proteins, are not incorporated into mature particles, authentic viral structural proteins, or virion-associated accessory proteins. a schematic diagram of the viral replication cycle of Frog virus 3 (FV3) is shown. the life cycle of FV3 is shown in schematic form. other viral proteins may also play roles in maintaining viral protein. iridoviruses encode a series of proteins whose function is to ensure an adequate supply of nucleotides for viral DNA synthesis. vCARD may inhibit the induction of interferon and/or apoptosis. a viral RNAse III-like protein is found within all iridoviruses. 79,80, thymidylate synthase, dUTPase, dUTPase, purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) and a dihydrofolate reductase homolog [12,82] Currently there are seven completely-sequenced ranavirus genomes ranging in size from 105\u2013140 kbp. all members of the subfamily Chordopoxvirinae share a conserved genomic core structure wherein gene order is conserved. despite the conservation of gene order, global sequence alignments show that sequence identity among members of the Chordopoxvirinae is only 27\u201329%. however, global sequence alignments show that sequence identity among members of the Chordopoxvirinae is only 27\u201329%. ranavirus infections range from inapparent to fulminant and involve a variety of tissues including the skin, kidney, liver, and intestine. a better understanding of ranavirus evolution, host shifts, and molecular determinants of ranavirus host range and pathogenesis will be achieved. iridovirus infections affect three classes of vertebrates: bony fish, amphibians, and reptiles. iridovirus infections have a marked effect on lower vertebrates. iridovirus infections have a marked effect on lower vertebrates. early studies with FV3 attempted to elucidate viral replicative events and the function of viral gene products using a variety of inhibitors. cycloheximide to confine viral gene expression to IE transcription, -amanitin to block host RNA polymerase II activity, phosphonacetic acid to block viral DNA synthesis, flurophenylalanine to block the expression of late viral proteins, etc. asMOs are DNA-like macromolecules, optimally 25 nucleotides in length, whose backbone contains morpholine rings instead of deoxyribose rings and non-ionic, phosphorodiamidate bonds in place of phosphodiester links. asMOs are not recognized by cellular DNA receptors such as TLR-9 or AIM-2. asMOs block gene expression by inhibiting splicing or preventing interaction of regulatory proteins with their specific target sequence. asMOs have been used to ascertain the function of several FV3 genes including those encoding the MCP, vPol-II, an 18 kDa viral gene product (18K), a putative myristoylated membrane protein (53R), and two IE proteins of unknown function. TEM study showed that cells treated with asMOs targeting either 32R or 46K formed viral assembly sites, but failed to form virions or recognizable assembly intermediates. recombinant viral proteins will be generated and used to produce polyclonal polyclonal polyclonal polyclonal polyclonal polyclonal polyclonal polyclonal. asMOs can be powerful tools for uncovering viral gene function. but their use is potentially limited by the nature of some ranavirus mRNAs. despite these limitations, asMO-mediated KD approaches may not succeed with all targeted genes. KO mutants have been used extensively to elucidate the function of various poxviruses genes. this feature makes KO mutants especially useful for identifying viral genes that play roles in immune evasion and virulence. despite using poxviruses as a guide, ranavirus KO mutants have only recently been isolated. several viruses encode an eIF-2 homolog that has been proposed to function as a pseudosubstrate for PKR [134] in vaccinia virus this homolog is designated K3L, whereas in ranaviruses it is termed vIF-2. in this scenario, PKR binds K3L/vIF-2 instead of eIF-2 and as a consequence eIF-2 is not phosphorylated. the increased IFN sensitivity of ATV57R was correlated with increased phosphorylation of eIF-2 and lack of PKR degradation. wt ATV degraded PKR and inhibited cellular eIF-2 phosphorylation. vIF-2 was a likely viral virulence/immune evasion protein. results confirm previous observation that 18K protein was not required for replication in vivo. finding that the truncated vIF-2 protein of FV3 was also required for replication in vivo was surprising because the FV3 homolog of vIF-2 is missing the N-terminal two-thirds of this protein. ICP46 (mol wt 44.1 kDa) is an IE gene product that is distributed predominantly within the cytoplasm but is also found within virions. over expression of SGIV ICP46 resulted in higher cell densities and increased growth of monolayer cultures. titers that were 10-fold higher in ICP46 expressing cells than in control cells. the vVEGF homolog aids in scab formation and wound healing. 158L exhibited partial structural resemblance to the histone-binding region of anti-silencing factor 1 (Asf1), a histone H3/H4 chaperon. vIF-2 Rothenburg et al. cloned the vIF-2 gene from Rana catesbeiana virus Z into an expression vector and examined its function in a yeast-based assay system. vIF-2 suppressed the toxic effects of human and zebrafish PKR. a study using vectors expressing the various domains of vIF-2 demonstrated that the N-terminal and central/helical domains were sufficient for suppressing PKR toxicity. the results provide the first formal proof that vIF-2 functions as a virus-encoded PKR antagonist. ts mutants, asMO- and siRNA-mediated knock down, gene knock out and recombinant protein studies are slowly elucidating the function of iridovirid genes. ts mutants proved useful in confirming and identifying various aspects of the virus life cycle, e.g., the two-stage of viral DNA synthesis. TEM analysis suggests that this class could be further sub-divided into at least two subclasses, those that failed to assemble icosahedral particles and those that formed ostensibly normal, but non-infectious, icosahedral particles. the remaining complementation groups appeared to contain defects in proteins associated with viral transcription (Class II) and viral DNA synthesis (Class III) asMOs bind complimentary sequences within the 5\u2032 non-translated region. they block scanning of the 40S ribosome by steric hindrance. asMOs block gene expression by inhibiting splicing or preventing interaction of regulatory proteins with their specific target sequence. KD of vPOL-II was shown to result in a marked reduction in the synthesis of late viral proteins. this result provided the first formal evidence that viral homologs of host RNA polymerase II played a role in the synthesis of late viral transcripts. TEM study showed that cells treated with asMOs targeting either 32R or 46K formed viral assembly sites. a 129 kDa protein of unknown function (ORF 41R) and the viral DMTase (ORF 83R) are ongoing and have demonstrated reductions in viral yields ranging from 41\u201392%. however, we have been unable to identify unambiguously the targeted protein in these latest studies. to overcome this problem, recombinant viral proteins will be generated and used to produce polyclonal antibodies for Western blot and immunofluorescent analyses. expression of FV3 transcripts encoding MCP, DMTase, and vPOL-II has been knocked down by siRNA and resulted in a marked inhibition of replication. KO mutants have been used extensively to elucidate the function of various poxviruses genes. able marker, into a virus-infected cell, may lead to degradation of the majority of plasmid DNA. the first ranavirus KO mutant targeted the homolog of eukaryotic translational initiation factor 2 (vIF-2) [132] to prevent translational shut-off, several viruses encode an eIF-2 homolog that has been proposed to function as a pseudosubstrate for PKR. NeoR was inserted downstream of the ATV 18K IE promoter. a PCR product bearing this construct was bracketed with sequences identical to those in the flanking region of the targeted gene. replication of the KO mutant was compared to wt virus in vitro and in vivo. KO mutants targeting the truncated vIF-2 protein (FV3-vIF-2) and the 18K IE protein (FV3-18K) were generated as well as a control, \u201cknock in\u201d mutant in which the puromycin-resistance/EGFP gene was inserted into a non-coding portion of the genome. results confirm previous observation that the 18K protein was not required for replication in vivo. vIF-2 homolog is required for full replication in vivo. a recombinant soft-shelled turtle iridovirus has recently been constructed. a fourth approach for determining viral gene function involves the synthesis of recombinant viral proteins. ISKNV ORF 48R encodes a viral protein with marked similarity to vascular endothelial growth factor (vVEGF) microinjection of a plasmid expressing vVEGF into zebrafish one-cell embryos resulted in pericardial edema and dilation of the tail region suggesting that vVEGF triggers vascular permeability. vVEGF homolog aids in scab formation and wound healing. SGIV 18K SGIV ORF 86R encodes a homolog of the FV3 18K immediate early protein. replication of the 18K KO in Xenopus laevis tadpoles was reduced about 10-fold compared to wt virus or a \u201cknock in\u201d mutant. yeast expressing human PKR failed to grow due to the toxicity of the PKR protein. however, yeast expressing vIF-2 suppressed the toxic effects of human PKR. vIF-2 suppressed the toxic effects of both human and zebrafish PKR. a gyrlio virus ERV1 detected ERV1 expression within the cytoplasm and nucleus, but not within VAS. ectopic expression did not enhance virus replication, but its effect on cellular proliferation was not examined. the authors speculated that RNAse III might play a role in the suppression of RNA interference, as has been suggested for other viral dsRNA-binding proteins. SGIV replication was compared in GP cells transfected with an empty vector and in GP cells expressing ICP46. titers were 10-fold higher in ICP46 expressing cells than in control cells. authors suggest that ICP46 might control host cell growth by regulating the cell cycle, preventing growth arrest, or delaying apoptosis. recombinant 158L exhibited partial structural resemblance to the histone-binding region of anti-silencing factor 1 (Asf1), a histone H3/H4 chaperon. 158L may be involved in both the regulation and expression of histone H3 and H4 methylation. vIF-2 Rothenburg et al. cloned the vIF-2 gene from Rana catesbeiana virus Z into an expression vector and examined its function in a yeast-based assay system. vIF-2 suppressed the toxic effects of human and zebrafish PKR suggesting that PKR antagonists evolved to protect physiologically-relevant targets. vIF-2 functions as a virus-encoded PKR antagonist. dUTPase (RGV), RNAse III (RBIV) and LITAF (SGIV) were generated and evaluated for their ability to influence cellular growth, enhance virus replication, induce apoptosis, and cleave dsRNA. ts mutants, asMO- and siRNA-mediated knock down, gene knock out, and recombinant protein studies are slowly elucidating the function of iridovirid genes. identifying and elucidating the function of replicative genes and those contributing to virulence, host range, and immune evasion. successful completion of these studies will involve the interactive efforts of virologists, immunologists, population biologists, and veterinary pathologists. general principles learned through study of iridovirus infections will be applicable to the study of other pathogens of cold-blooded vertebrates."}
