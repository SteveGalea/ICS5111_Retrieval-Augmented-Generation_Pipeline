{"summary": "population health surveillance theory reflects the authors' system of thinking. the population health surveillance theory provides a systematic way of understanding, organizing and evaluating the population health surveillance process. a theory is an attempt to understand, explain and interpret a reality of a phenomenon or a given subject matter as one sees it. the term 'population health surveillance theory' refers to a theory integrating all concepts essential to the surveillance process. it should provide a systematic way of understanding, explaining and organizing surveillance and serve as a global base line. the PHST makes a prediction on whether a given surveillance program is acceptable or not, based on exhaustivity of the concepts. the SPS agreement sets out the basic rules for food safety and animal and plant health standards. these measures must be based on international standards or on a scientific assessment of risk [8,9]. the agreement has increased the need for countries to provide science-based evidence to support their claims regarding population health status. surveillance was defined by the WHO to include \"the epidemiological study of disease as a dynamic process\" in 1966, surveillance was defined by the WHO to include \"the epidemiological study of disease as a dynamic process\" and a variety of disease control activities [27,28], thus surveillance does not encompass direct responsibility for disease control activities [17,26,27]. 'surveillance' refers to the activity of watching over a person, a population, an object or a phenomenon. surveillance should include the following elements: ongoing data collection, analysis, interpretation, knowledge production, and timely information dissemination (i.e. information sharing) on the state of a pre-defined target. PHS often involves a specific target (e.g. specific disease and population), specific objective(s) and continuous (repetitive) processes. the surveillance process adapts to the needs of the stakeholders' objectives. surveillance involves continuous data collection, the use of intelligent and advanced data analysis to generate knowledge. initiation of a surveillance process usually requires the presence of three essential elements: i) a dissatisfaction, ii) a need for knowledge and/or time dependent information, and iii) some level of motivation to eliminate the dissatisfaction and meet the information need about the population health status. the definition of a problem often requires close cooperation and consensus building among various stakeholders working in different disciplines. the problem formulation process must be clear, rigorous, precise, and based on a constructivist paradigm and intersubjectivity. surveillance is an ongoing process of intentional actions aimed at producing two types of knowledge: tacit and explicit. the tacit knowledge can be encoded, articulated into formal language, shared, stored and communicated through information technologies. the surveillance program evaluation needs to be a recurrent process aimed at comparing surveillance results with surveillance objectives. population health surveillance PHS refers to the health surveillance of a given population. 'individual health surveillance' refers to the description of the health or disease status of a person or an animal. 'individual health surveillance' involves a specific population structure. the levels of data analysis and data representation are usually rudimentary in any monitoring process compared to 'Surveillance' surveillance is based on an epidemiological intelligence approach, meaning collected data is processed intelligently to produce knowledge. surveillance involves continuous data collection, the use of intelligent and advanced data analysis techniques, the production of knowledge, and the communication of the information to decision makers. problem formulation is often challenging due to the degree of difficulty relating to the nature of the problem, and the knowledge and experience of the people formulating the problem. problem formulation requires the formal and specific description of the dissatisfaction, which represents the first step in the knowledge production process. surveillance planning is a collective action plan that identifies activities, task division and resource allocation. the final result is a collective action plan that identifies activities, task division and resource allocation. it is necessary to link them all together via an administrative and organizational plan (the program) initiation of a surveillance process usually requires the presence of three essential elements: i) a dissatisfaction, ii) a need for knowledge and/or time dependent information. there is a need for surveillance as long as these elements persist. dissatisfaction is the feeling of psychological discomfort that emerges when a person compares perception of two situations. the problem formulation process must be clear, rigorous, precise, and based on a constructivist paradigm and intersubjectivity. the final result in surveillance planning is a collective action plan that identifies activities, task division and resource allocation. the final result in surveillance planning is a collective action plan that identifies activities, task division and resource allocation. the surveillance program evaluation needs to be a recurrent process. the problem, the objectives and the surveillance plan may be re-assessed accordingly. the PHST is an explicit theory that helps explain and organize the surveillance process. the PHS theory proposes a clear distinction between surveillance and monitoring processes. surveillance is based on an epi-intelligence approach and aims to produce knowledge through advanced analysis techniques. problem formulation and knowledge production are two essential components of PHS. a rapidly changing situation must be reassessed more often than a slow changing situation. this implies that it is in the nature of the surveillance activity to contain a retroaction mechanism. the proposed theory describes surveillance as a complex organization. surveillance is based on an epidemiological intelligence approach and surveillance programs should be structured as an intelligence organization. the proposed theory of population health surveillance refers concurrently to a sequential structured process, a human organization and a system. the proposed theory could be used as the basis for a conceptual evaluation tool of public health and animal health surveillance programs in a complement to existing methodological evaluation. the positivism paradigm views truth as absolute and values the original and unique aspects of scientific research. reality is changing over time and knowledge is constructed jointly by the researcher and the researched through consensus [34]."}
