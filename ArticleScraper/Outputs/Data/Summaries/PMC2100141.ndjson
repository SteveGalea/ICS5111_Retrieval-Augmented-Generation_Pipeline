{"summary": "immunization with the gp120 surface unit of the HIV-1 envelope protein does not lead to the induction of potent or broadly reactive neutralizing antibodies. the recent atomic level resolution of monoclonal antibody b12 bound to the CD4 receptor binding site of the gp120 molecule provides new insights into how successful neutralizing antibodies access functionally conserved regions of the Env glycoprotein. the cognate viral epitopes for these MAbs have been well characterized and are being evaluated as vaccine immunogens. improvements are being sought by introducing specific structural alterations [19,20] and by targeting autoreactive B cell pathways [21]. Detailed molecular and immunologic studies of the autologous neutralization response would enhance our understanding of viral determinants that are vulnerable to antibody attack. an example is seen in how soluble CD4 binding rearranges the structure of gp120 to expose the highly conserved coreceptor binding domain. such effects might be discovered by applying high throughput screening methods to the plethora of existing MAbs. assays using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and uncloned viruses are being replaced with assays that utilize molecularly cloned Envpseudotyped viruses and genetically engineered target cells lines. this new technology affords greater sensitivity, reproducibility, high throughput, and cost-effectiveness compared to PBMC assays. simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and chimeric simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) are widely used for HIV-1 vaccine development. the creation of new and better SHIVs from non-clade B viruses would facilitate assay standardization as well as vaccine challenge models. recent studies in which the MAbs were discovered to bind one or more self antigens raised the possibility that these antibody specificities are subjected to negative regulation mechanisms. thus, Env as an immunogen may bypass key steps in the B cell inductive pathway, or actively induce negative production or downregulation of some broadly neutralizing antibodies. HIV infections have investigated immunoglobulins, the final product of B cell responses. a number of basic questions are still unanswered."}
