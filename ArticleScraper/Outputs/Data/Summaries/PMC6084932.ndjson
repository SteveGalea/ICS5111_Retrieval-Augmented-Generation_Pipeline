{"summary": "650 patients included, 316 had culture-confirmed PTB; 190 (29.2%), 323 (49.7%), 70 (10.8%), and 67 (10.3%) were classified into the definitely active, probably active, indeterminate activity, and probably inactive groups. radiographic activity showed high sensitivity (97.1%, 95% confidence interval (CI), 94.6\u201398.5) and negative predictive values (92.7%, 95% CI, 86.6\u201396.2). Chest CT can detect early lesions of PTB and distinguish them from other etiologies [1, 6, 7]. it can also provide additional information on the mycobacterial activity of TB lesions. retrospective review included patients older than 18 years of age, with suspected PTB, between January 2012 and February 2015. patients with presumptive PTB were categorized into four groups, by radiographic activity, from the highest to lowest grade. patients with presumptive PTB were categorized into four groups, by radiographic activity. the radiographic activities were determined as being of a higher grade of those. if the lesion of suggested PTB was in two or more of the above categories, the radiographic activities were of a higher grade of those. TB-PCR was conducted using either the Xpert MTB/RIF assay (Cepheid Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) or AdvanSure TB/NTM RT-PCR kit (LG Life Sciences, Seoul, Korea) Definition of PTB and other etiologies Microbiologically confirmed PTB was defined as the growth of MTB in the culture. clinically diagnosed PTB was defined as cases in which patients were considered to have PTB, based data were compared using the Mann\u2013Whitney U test for continuous variables. the youden index, defined as (sensitivity + specificity) 1, was calculated for every type of radiographic activity. the cutoff radiographic activity at which the Youden index was the highest was considered the optimal cut-off. the study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of each hospital. the need for informed consent was waived due to the retrospective nature of the study. patients with presumptive PTB were categorized into four groups by radiographic activity, from the highest to lowest grade. the choice between bronchial washing (BW) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) via bronchoscopy was based on the judgment of individual bronchoscopists. all the bronchoscopic specimens for the Acid-Fast Bacilli (AFB) smears and cultures were processed and pretreated as recommended. microbiologically, histologically and genetically confirmed PTB were classified as probable PTB. cases of clinically diagnosed PTB were classified as probable PTB. 731 patients underwent chest CT and bronchoscopy because of presumed PTB. of these patients, 81 met the exclusion criteria. 650 patients were eligible to participate, and they comprised 190 patients. the data are presented as median (interquartile range) or No. (%) a Cases are duplicated PTB = pulmonary tuberculosis; IQR = interquartile range; COPD = chronic obstructive lung disease; CKD = chronic kidney disease; HIV = human immunodeficiency virus; BW = bronchial washing; BAL = broncho-alveolar lavage Culture yield of MTB according to the radiographic activities. 0.001 Male sex, % 130 (68.4) 157 (48.6) 43 (61.4) 40 (59.7) 0.001 Comorbiditya COPD and asthma 3 (1.6) 15 (4.6) 3 (4.3) 7 (10.4) 0.022 Thyroid disease 1 (0.5) 5 (1.5) 0 0 0.394 Cardiovascular disease 15 (7.9) 25 (7.7) 6 (8.6) 10 (14.9) 0.281 Malignancy 5 (2.6) 9 (2.8) 3 the data are presented as median (interquartile range) or No. (%) a Cases are duplicated CT = computed tomography; PTB = pulmonary tuberculosis; IQR = interquartile range; COPD = chronic obstructive lung disease; CKD = chronic kidney disease; HIV = human immunodeficiency virus; BAL = broncho-alveolar lavage. youden indexa Definite PTB suggested active PTB 97.1 (94.6\u201398.5) 42.9 (37.2\u201348.7) 66.9 (62.7\u201371.0) 92.7 (86.6\u201396.2) 2.03 (1.76\u20132.32) 0.07 (0.04\u20130.14) 0.40 (combined with definitely and probably active) Definitely active 35.8 (30.9\u201341.1) 78.7 (73.5\u201383.1) 66.8 (59.6\u201373.3) 50.6 ( bacterial pneumonia as the cause of parenchymal lung lesion was the most prevalent, followed by PNTM. bacterial pneumonia as the cause of parenchymal lung lesion was most prevalent, followed by PNTM. radiographic activities on chest CT.
