{"summary": "HA and NA properties affect host- and cell-specificity. neuraminidase (NA) removes receptors by cleaving SIAs. HA and NA properties affect host- and cell-specificity. viral fitness depends on continuous fine-tuning of the HA/NA balance during virus evolution. a non-optimal HA/NA balance is for instance adapted by evolving increased NA activity as well as decreased binding by HA to the decoy glycan-receptor repertoire on mucins present in the mucus. soluble substrate 2\u2032-(4-methylumbelliferyl)--d-N-acetylneuraminic acid (MUNANA) can be used to determine the NA activity on a soluble substrate but ignores the effects of the virion context on NA activity on a receptor-coated surface. methods that determine the dynamic effects of HA and NA activity urgently need improvement to allow integration into a model that accurately provides a quantitative description. receptor interaction by real-time recording of virion binding to, and release from, receptor-coated surfaces. these interactions are highly polyvalent by nature and expected to be poorly described by equilibrium binding models. we therefore established a flexible experimental set-up using synthetic sialoside receptors as well as N-linked or O-linked sialoglycoproteins. PR8MtSIN is a faster binder than PR8CAM2,3 (Fig 1A and Fig 1B) but reached a maximum binding signal of 9 nm at the highest concentration only after 4 hours. a fully occupied sensor surface theoretically accommodates 3.3E+07 spherical virus particles. 0.007378 nm/min per 100pM virus particles for PR8CAM2,3; P = 0.0005) differed significantly. vobs was calculated for all binding curves of PR8MtSIN and PR8CAM2,3. virus dissociation in PBS was recorded for 60 minutes. AV association and dissociation rates can be precisely determined as BLI provides quantitative recording of receptor loading levels. lowering the receptor density, resulting in less potential HA-receptor contacts between virus and sensor surface, gradually reduced maximum binding levels. a 2-fold higher fractional receptor loading was required for the weaker binder PR8CAM2,3 to reach 50% of the maximum fractional initial binding rate. glycan array analysis of HA proteins showed absolute specificity shift. soluble HA proteins can have access to short glycans on glycan arrays. virus envelope-embedded HAs cannot, depending on virus strain, bind to the same glycans on BLI sensors. biotinylated 3\u2019SLNLN or 6\u2019SLNLN (B, C), Fc-tagged 3\u2019N fetuin (D) or biotinylated 6\u2019N transferrin (6\u2019N transferrin bt) (E) were loaded to maximum levels to SA or Protein A biosensors. binding of 100 pM PR8CAM2,3, PR8CAM2,6 or WSNWT virus was monitored for 60 minutes in presence of 10 M OC fetuins are abundantly present on soluble mucins present in respiratory mucus. only PR8CAM2,3 and PR8MtSIN appeared to be able to bind to 3\u2019O Fetuin. 2,6-linked SIAs (TX77NAMtSIN) or 2,3-linked SIAs (PR8MtSIN) bind to 6\u2019N transferrin bt. in the presence of NA activity, the binding rate of TX77 NAMtSIN became increasingly lower in time, presumably reflecting virion release due to ongoing receptor depletion. biotinylated 6\u2019N transferrin bt was loaded to maximum levels on Streptavidin sensors and bound with 100 pM PR8MtSIN or TX77NAMtSIN in absence or presence of 10 M OC. sensors bound in (B) with virus were regenerated at pH2, removing all virus particles, and subsequently bound again with 100 pM TX77NAMtSIN. biotinylated 3\u2019SLN or its fucosylated derivative (SLeX, NeuNAc2,3Gal1,4(Fuc1,3)GlcNAc) were loaded to maximum levels on SA sensors and bound with 30 pM PR8MtSIN in the presence (G) or absence (H) of 10 M OC for 15 minutes. eluted much faster from 3\u2019N fetuin or 3\u2019SLN than WSNHAMtSIN HA and NA are in competition for binding/cleavage of the same receptor. this could also be a reflection of HA/NA balance on a specific receptor. HA and NA are in competition for binding/cleavage of the same receptor. vobs is similar for SLeX and 3\u2019SLN in the absence of NA activity. an active NA resulted in a lower vobs and maximum binding level. a smaller area under the curve for 3\u2019SLN and in a faster virion self-elution from 3\u2019SLN. the effect must reflect a neuraminidase activity-dependent change in the receptor-bound virus particles. the effect must reflect a neuraminidase activity-dependent change in the receptor-bound virus particles. -F were analyzed by IBM SPSS statistic 24. there was no significant difference between curves with 10M OC and 625nM OC. curves of 10M OC and 625nM OC were significantly different from 39nM, 2.45nM and 0nM. complete NA inhibition gave binding curves displaying a continuous increase of virus binding. however, the vobs of PR8MtSIN increased at lower OC concentrations in a concentration-dependent way. results imply that NAs with a relatively low cleavage rate contribute to the vobs by binding with their active site to the SIA receptor. surface Fig 6A\u20136D show NA-dependent dissociation of viruses. all four viruses showed faster dissociation when more virus was loaded. the only plausible mechanism by which viruses can assist each other in self-elution is by exerting NA activity on a larger surface area than their own contact area. Virus dissociation plotted on positive Y-axis as fraction of virus released relative to binding level reached in panel E. regenerated sensors were allowed to re-bind PR8MtSIN at a concentration of 100 pM to determine the degree of de-sialylation that occurred in (F). biotinylated 3\u2019N+O fetuin -coated sensors were loaded with WSNHAMtSIN to a 15% saturation level in the presence of OC (blue and red) in the next step, these sensors were incubated with PR8MtSIN in the presence or in the absence of OC. in the next step, these sensors were incubated with PR8MtSIN in the presence of OC. we conclude that NA activity is the driver of virus rolling on a receptor-coated surface. biotinylated 3\u2019N+O fetuin (3\u2019N+O fetuin bt) is indicated by the large Xs. origin of the HA and NA proteins of the viruses is indicated. pM is a potentially versatile tool to obtain mechanistic and quantitative insight into the dynamics of virus-receptor interaction. we established a flexible experimental set-up using synthetic sialoside receptors as well as N-linked or O-linked sialoglycoproteins which carry sialoglycan receptors attached in the natural linkage-conformation. PR8MtSIN is a faster binder than PR8CAM2,3 (Fig 1A and Fig 1B) but reached a maximum binding signal of 9 nm at the highest concentration only after 4 hours. a fully occupied sensor surface theoretically accommodates 3.3E+07 spherical virus particles (100 nm diameter; S3 Fig and [39\u201342]) vobs were calculated for all binding curves of PR8MtSIN and PR8CAM2,3. the vobs were calculated for all binding curves of PR8MtSIN and PR8CAM2,3. after 60 minutes sensors were washed (PBS, 3 times) and virus dissociation in PBS was recorded. the effect of receptor density on IAV association and dissociation rates can be precisely determined. lowering the receptor density, resulting in less potential HA-receptor contacts between virus and sensor surface, gradually reduced maximum binding levels. a 2-fold higher fractional receptor loading was required for the weaker binder PR8CAM2,3 (0.5930.01752) glycan array analysis of the HA proteins of lab strains PR8CAM2,3 and PR8CAM2,6, which only differ by substitution D190E, showed an absolute specificity shift. soluble HA proteins can have access to short glycans on glycan arrays. soluble HA proteins can have access to short glycans on glycan arrays. ary glycans carrying one, two or three LacNAc repeats terminated with a 2,3- or 2,6-linked SIA are indicated. mean of 6 independent replicates are graphed, standard errors of the means are indicated. binding of 100 pM PR8CAM2,3, PR8CAM2,6 or WSNWT virus was monitored for 60 minutes in presence of 10 M OC. the application of (tailor-made) glycoproteins enables to elucidate quantitative differences in IAV receptor-binding fine specificity. the versatility of the latter is further illustrated by showing the relative specificity for N-linked versus O-linked glycans using engineered fetuin constructs. non-bound virions are able to cleave receptors loaded on BLI sensors. we used viruses carrying the same NA but a different HA. they bind 2,6-linked SIAs or 2,3-linked SIAs to 6\u2019N transferrin bt. 6\u2019N transferrin bt is indicated by the large Xs. origin of the HA and NA proteins of the viruses used is indicated. the left and right panels correspond with the graphs shown in (B) and (C) respectively. PR8MtSIN and WSNHAMtSIN both carry the same HAMtSIN. either NAMtSIN (high NA activity) or NAWSN (low NA activity), respectively, were bound at 30 pM concentration to biotinylated 3\u2019SLN or Fc-tagged 3\u2019N Fetuin loaded to maximum level in the presence (A, D) or absence (B, E) of 10 M OC. the self-elution rate from 3\u2019N fetuin was higher than from 3\u2019SLN. HA and NA are in competition for binding/cleavage of the same receptor. both viruses bind at similar, but relatively low rate to 6\u2019N transferrin bt. a change of receptor (in this case to fucosylated 3\u2019SLN, giving Sialyl-LewisX; SLeX) was shown to have differential effect on the observed binding rate. vobs is similar for SLeX and 3\u2019SLN in the absence of NA activity. an active NA resulted in a lower vobs and maximum binding level. the effect must reflect a neuraminidase activity-dependent change in the receptor-bound virus particles. Cleavage of SIAs by NA is expected to gradually decrease the number of HA-SIA contacts between receptor-coated surface and virus until the particle dissociates. significant differences between initial binding curves shown in panels C-F were analyzed by IBM SPSS statistic 24. there was no significant difference between curves with 10M OC and 625nM OC (P>0.1), whereas curves of 10M OC and 625nM OC were significantly different from 39nM, 2.45nM and 0nM (P0.001). active site mutations that abolish catalytic NA activity have resulted in NA-dependent hemagglutination, which could be inhibited by OC. vobs of PR8MtSIN increased at lower OC concentrations in a concentration-dependent way. NA activity enables virus rolling over a receptor-coated surface. all four viruses showed faster dissociation when more virus was loaded. the only plausible mechanism by which viruses can assist each other in self-elution is by exerting NA activity on a larger surface area than their own contact area. this results in faster self-elution as shown by plotting fractional virus dissociation against time. the concentration of virus released from the surface is too low for re-association and non-bound virus does not contribute to receptor cleavage. we conclude that virus particles exert NA activity while moving over the receptor surface before NA activity-driven dissociation takes place. rolling of virus particles predicted to be faster for virus particles with higher NA activity. this was tested by comparing the binding and dissociation dynamics of PR8MtSIN and WSNHAMtSIN. biotinylated 3\u2019N+O fetuin -coated sensors were loaded with WSNHAMtSIN to a 15% saturation level in the presence of OC. binding of WSNHAMtSIN to 15% of sensor surface in the second step (red) prevented complete removal of SIAs by PR8MtSIN in the third step (red) this implies that WSNHAMtSIN protects its contact surface with the sensor against the NA activity of PR8MtSIN. sensors from B were allowed to re-bind 30 pM PR8MtSIN at a concentration of 100 pM to determine the degree of de-sialylation that occurred in (C) the initial monovalent HA-SIA interaction is virus concentration-dependent and governed by a binding rate constant kon (M1 s1) and a dissociation constant koff (s1). the number of simultaneous interactions required for virtually irreversible (koff 0) binding is low and logically depends on receptor density and the koff and kon values of a virus. the rapid interconversion of binding states via the association/dissociation events shown in Fig 8 enables a virus to roll over the surface. the contribution of NA to receptor binding is determined by a dissociation constant (KD = koff/koff) for the substrate (step I in blue) and a catalytic rate constant (kcat; bold blue arrow) determining the receptor cleavage rate. a lower kcat will result in prolonged receptor binding before cleavage or dissociation takes place. this will enhance the chance for additional binding events. HA-SIA interactions allow a virus to roll over the surface. this is schematically indicated by the curled arrows where NA cleavage activity creates receptor-free positions on the surface. the direction in which the virus rolls (away from the empty position or \u201creaching over\u201d the empty position) still needs further research. low binding rates prevent reaching a binding plateau within 60 min. initial binding rate vobs is a physiologically relevant parameter for IAV binding. it can be determined by BLI, but not easily by endpoint assays like conventional glycan arrays. NA contributes to the initial binding rate even though it is capable of receptor cleavage leading to virus elution. changes in HA-receptor binding specificity and avidity are thought to be prime factors in causing, or responding to, antigenic change [61,62] or infection of an altered host cell range. SIA cleavage by NA creates a receptor density gradient that drives virus rolling. when receptor density becomes too low, virus dissociation will occur. resulting binding/dissociation profiles can be recorded by BLI. however, lacking a mathematical model, these profiles can be described by empirical parameters. patches of NA clusters at the tip and the base of long filaments have been described [63,64] but other reports suggest the presence of NA along the length of the filament. a role in clearance of SIAs from mucus by long budding filaments have not pinched of from the cell surface. IAV was shown to require NA activity for penetrating through a mucus layer in vitro[24]. the irreversible but highly dynamic binding mode leads to virus rolling results in virus self-elution from a receptor-coated surface. the overall density of SIAs on the cell surface is estimated to be high [73,74] but also very heterogeneous. the initial monovalent HA-SIA interaction is virus concentration-dependent and governed by a binding rate constant kon (M1 s1) and a dissociation constant koff (s1). kon/koff 0.3 to 3mM [48\u201350] cannot be easily determined. subsequent HA binding steps are intramolecular, resulting in multivalent binding. a low kcat promotes the chance on secondary binding events (mostly of HA) the initial HA-dependent binding event (step 1 in red) is a virus concentration-dependent intermolecular process governed by a binding rate constant kon (with the unit M1 s1) and a dissociation constant koff (with the unit s1) subsequent HA binding steps (e.g. steps 2 and 4) are intramolecular with a kon (not necessarily the same as in the first step) and a dissociation constant koff (with the unit a significant contribution to the initial binding rate by NA is expected. longer lasting, BLI-detectable, binding requires the formation of additional HA- and/or NA\u2013SIA bonds. the number of simultaneous interactions that can occur is logically dependent on receptor density and koff/kon ratios. an apparent KD for IAV-receptor interaction has been determined [35] from fractional saturation (f) levels obtained after 60 min at different receptor densities (KD = [virus](1-f))/f) such an application of BLI as an endpoint binding assay falsely assumes an equilibrium binding model. further errors into apparent KD determinations are introduced by low binding rates that prevent reaching a binding plateau within 60 min. gene engineering enables binding studies to glycoproteins carrying specific glycan-types (N-linked, O-linked) or glycan-density. further tuning of glycan structure can be accomplished by glycoprotein expression in cell lines with specific differences in their glycosyltransferase expression patterns. recent emergence of H3N2 strains displaying NA-dependent hemagglutination hint at a role for NA in determining changes in receptor binding that accompany changes in NA might facilitate (transient) functional changes in HA by (temporarily) contributing to the initial virus binding rate. the strength of BLI lays in studying the simultaneous effect of NA and HA on the dynamics of virus-receptor interactions. HA/NA ratio and distribution pattern are additional variables that can be involved in functional evolution of the HA/NA balance and its effect on virus rolling. the latter has been shown to occur as singular tetramers as well as small clusters thereof. filamentous morphology is frequently observed in clinical samples. the combination of a receptor-binding and a receptor-destroying enzyme has been proposed to enable IAV movement over a cell surface by a mechanism of repeated cycles of receptor binding, receptor release and receptor cleavage. virions, once attached to the mucus, remain receptor bound for their entire extracellular life. the cilia of columnar epithelial cells (0.2 to 0.3 m in diameter; 6 to 7 m in length) are covered by membrane-spanning mucins and tethered muco-polysaccharides that protrude into the narrow (200nm) space between cilia from which soluble mucins or 40 nm beads were shown to be excluded. the overall density of SIAs on the cell surface is estimated to be high [73,74 HA/NA balance should be considered as the combination of HA and NA kinetic parameters, including factors like HA/NA ratio and distribution. protective antibodies targeting IAV receptor binding sites will function within this context with an important role for the HA/NA/receptor balance as they will compete with receptors for interaction with IAV. titers were determined by measuring the TCID50 on MDCK-II cells. HA and NA genes were quantified by western blotting of standard 10% SDS/PAGE gels. expression vectors were cloned in pCD5 (HA) or pFRT (NA) expression vectors flanked by CD5 signal peptide-, GCN4-isoleucine-zipper trimerization (for HA) or tetramerization (for NA) domains. codon-optimized cDNA fragments encoding the variable domains of the heavy and light chains of antibody FI6 [80] were synthesized by GenScript human codon-optimized cDNA encoding biotin protein ligase (BirA)[84] was cloned in frame with sequences encoding a CD5 signal peptide and a 6His tag. CHO cells are deficient in 2,6 sialyltransferases and therefore exclusively synthesize 2,3 SIA linkages. a similar volume of reaction buffer was added to each well, mixed well, and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 60 min. the reaction was terminated with the stop solution (0.1 M glycine, 25% ethanol, pH 10.7) the fluorescence of the 4-MU reaction product was immediately determined in relative fluorescence units (RFUs) PBS with calcium and magnesium (PBS+/+) was used as standard assay buffer. fetuin-coated sensors were incubated with different lectins. fetuin-coated sensors were analyzed for their lectin-binding properties. ng/ul, SNA, MAL-I, MAL-II, ECA, all from Vector Labs were graphed. initial binding rates, corresponding to the sloops of the binding curves during the first few minutes of the virus-binding experiments, were determined by second order polynominal equation (GraphPad Prism 7.04) reassortant virus strain TX77NAMtSIN was grown in MDCK-II cells. titers were determined by measuring the TCID50 on MDCK-II cells. HA and NA genes were confirmed by sequence analysis (Macrogen) the specimens were examined in a JEOL JEM1400 transmission electron microscope at 120 kV. images were taken at a magnification of 30.000x with a Matataki 2K x 2K camera. codon-optimized cDNA fragments were cloned in pCD5 (HA) or pFRT (NA) expression vectors flanked by CD5 signal peptide-, GCN4-isoleucine-zipper trim human codon-optimized cDNA encoding biotin protein ligase (BirA)[84] was cloned in frame with sequences encoding a CD5 signal peptide and a 6His tag. CHO cells are deficient in 2,6 sialyltransferases and therefore exclusively synthesize 2,3 SIA linkages. ylated transferrin (Sigma) contains two glycan chains exclusively carrying 2,6 SIAs. activity of IAV virus particles as well as recombinant soluble NAs was determined by using a fluorimetric assay similar to previously described. phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 0.05% Tween, PBS, and deionized water were immediately subjected to imaging. biolayer interferometry BLI analysis was performed on an Octet QK machine using standard streptavidin (SA) or protein A bio-sensors. PR8MtSIN-specific antibody (03/242 from NIBSC) was used for detection of virus binding in presence of OC with or without prior sensor generation. fetuin-coated sensors were incubated with different lectins. lectin-binding curves were obtained. HA trimers are closely packaged on the virus surface. a fully loaded streptavidin can form a bivalent interaction with an HA-trimer in which the SIA-binding sites are spaced at 4nm distance. lowering the receptor-density results in a non-homogenous sensor surface with streptavidins carrying 0, 1 or 2 receptor molecules. biotinylated receptors (synthetic glycans or glycoproteins) were bound to SA sensors. Fc-tagged glycoproteins were bound to Protein A sensors. biotinylated fetuin was made by expressing a construct encoding a Bap-tag fused to fetuin that yields C-terminally biotinylated 3\u2019N+O fetuin (3\u2019N+O fetuin bt) upon expression in CHO K1 cells. the glycoproteins were analyzed for linkage type specificity of their sialic acids using lectin binding. TX77NAMtSIN carries the HA encoding segment of A/Bilthoven/1761/76 (H3N2) in the background of seven PR8MtSIN segments. 0.71% of the virus particles present during the initial loading were associated to the sensor surface. biotinylated 3\u2019SLN was loaded to sensors at a density range. 1.0 corresponds to a sensor maximally loaded with receptor. a fractional receptor loading was plotted against fractional receptor loading. fetuin specifically engineered and expressed to carry either exclusively N-linked or O-linked glycans. binding of 100 pM PR8MtSIN and PR8CAM2,3 was performed. glycoproteins were analyzed for linkage type specificity using lectins MAL I (specific for SIA2,3Gal1,4GlcNAc linkages abundantly present on N-linked glycans), MAL II (specific for SIA2,3Gal1,3GalNAc linkages abundantly present on O-linked glycans) and ECA (specific for terminal Gal1,4GlcNAc epitopes present on non-sialylated quantitative PCR or Western blotting are sensitive to variation caused by RNA or protein contamination of virus preparations. densitometric quantification of the polymerase content of a virus preparation was used, assuming that every particle carries eight genome segments. antibodies GT288-GTX629696 (WSN) and N1-7D3 (PR8) were used. quantification was calibrated using a Western blot of a standard concentration series of recombinant soluble NA of PR8MtSIN and WSN. the activity of recombinant WSN NA was 5.4-fold lower than of PR8MtSIN NA, whereas the NA activity of the cognate virus particles showed a 31.4-fold HA clearly affects the self-elution rate as, in combination with the same NA, self-elution from 3\u2019N fetuin is much more efficient in companion of the weaker binding HA of PR8CAM2,6 (B) than in companion of the stronger binding HA of WSNWT (A) initial binding rate by NA suffers most from receptor destruction by its NA. a binding curve bends down fastest in absence of OC (F)."}
