{"summary": "the type I interferon family (IFN-/) represents a key element of the innate antiviral defense. in humans the type I IFN family encompasses 13 IFN-, a single IFN- and a few minor IFN subtypes (IFN-//) that all bind to a single heterodimeric cell surface complex known as IFN-/ receptor. mice deficient in both IFN-/ and IFN- are extremely susceptible to various respiratory viruses, demonstrating redundancy of the two IFN systems in the lung that is rich in epithelial cells. the importance of the type I IFN system for controlling enteric viral infections vary greatly depending on the challenge virus. intestinal epithelial cells show low level IFN-/ receptor expression and do not respond to type I IFN. we measured the expression of marker genes of epithelial cells (Cdh1 encoding E-cadherin) and leukocytes (Ptprc encoding CD45) intestinal epithelial cells minimally express IFN-/ receptor and do not respond to type I IFN. RT-qPCR analysis of IFN-/ receptor chains (Ifnar1 and Ifnar2) in intestinal epithelial cells. FACS analysis confirmed the presence of easily detectable levels of IFNAR1 on LPLs from wild-type but not Ifnar1 -/- mice. the staining of IECs from wild-type mice was not more intense than the staining of IECs from Ifnar1 -/- mice. IFN receptor knockout mice were used to exclude background staining of Mx1 induced by endogenous IFN. in stark contrast, IFN- injection into Ifnar1 -/- mice resulted in strong accumulation of Mx1 in the nuclei of lamina propria cells. trachea, including the E-cadherin-positive epithelial cells, showed prominent nuclear Mx1 staining (S1F Fig) no Mx1 staining was observed in tissue from the respiratory tract after combined treatment with IFN- and IFN- of Ifnar1 -/- Ifnlr1 -/- double knockout control mice. adult wild-type mice were injected intraperitoneally with 100 g of polyI:C. intestinal tissue was harvested at 2 and 6 h post-treatment. expression of Ifna5 and Ifnl2/3 was analyzed by RT-qPCR. mammalian reoviruses have a wide cell tropism and exhibit a low degree of species specificity. type I IFN signaling is of crucial importance for restricting systemic reovirus dissemination. intra-gastric inoculation of adult Ifnar1 -/- mice with human reovirus type 3 Dearing led to severe neurological symptoms. reovirus replication in small intestinal tissue was analyzed by virus titration. reovirus replication in small intestinal tissue was analyzed by virus titration. feces were even higher than from Ifnlr1 -/- mice. reovirus antigen was almost exclusively found in IECs of Ifnlr1 -/- mice at day 4 post-infection. reovirus was restricted to lamina propria cells in Ifnar1 -/- mice. reovirus replicates in epithelial cells of intestine and biliary tract. suckling mice are far more susceptible to rota- and reovirus-induced disease. reovirus replicates in epithelial cells of intestine and biliary tract. suckling wild-type (n = 7), Ifnar1 -/- (n = 8) and Ifnlr1 -/- (n = 11) mice were infected orally with 5 x 106 pfu of reovirus T3D. reovirus type 3 may spread to the intrahepatic biliary epithelium (cholangiocytes) and to the brain, causing either liver disease or lethal encephalitis. reovirus type 3 may spread to the intrahepatic biliary epithelium (cholangiocytes) and to the brain. no virus antigen-positive cells were present in either the liver or the bile ducts of wild-type mice. analysis of tissues from Ifnlr1 -/- mice that succumbed to the disease revealed destruction of the biliary epithelium, accumulation of virus antigen and blockade of the bile ducts. reovirus can specifically target cholangiocytes of Ifnlr1 -/- mice which prominently express functional IFN- Ifnlr1 -/- mice failed to mount a proper IFN response on day 1. protective response in the gut is predominantly mediated by IFN-. timely IFN- production by epithelial cells drives rapid clearance of intestinal reovirus infection. at day 1, a large number of virus-positive IECs were detected in the terminal part of the small intestine of wild-type, Ifnar1 -/- and Ifnlr1 -/- mice. high levels of nuclear Mx1 were detectable in the majority of IECs in tissue samples from wild-type and Ifnar1 -/- animals already at day 1 post-infection. a small fraction of villi were positive for Mx1 at this late time point. RT-qPCR analysis of ISG expression showed that during enteric virus infection type I IFN cannot compensate for the loss of IFN-, leading to prolonged replication of the virus in epithelial cells. type I IFN appears to play no major role at this early stage of the reovirus infection. intestinal epithelial cells show low level IFN-/ receptor expression. RT-qPCR analysis revealed strongly decreased expression of Ifnar1 and Ifnar2. RT-qPCR analysis of IFN-/ receptor chains (Ifnar1 and Ifnar2) and IFN- receptor chains (Ifnlr1 and Il10r2) in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) and lamina propria lymphocytes (LPL) isolated from whole intestinal tissue of adult wild-type mice (n = 4\u20138) FACS analysis confirmed the presence of easily detectable levels of IFNAR1 on LPLs from wild-type but not Ifnar1 -/- mice. the staining of IECs from wild-type mice was not more intense than the staining of IECs from Ifnar1 -/- mice. IFN receptor knockout mice were used to exclude background staining of Mx1 induced by endogenous IFN. in stark contrast, IFN- injection into Ifnar1 -/- mice resulted in strong accumulation of Mx1 in the nuclei of lamina propria cells. no Mx1 staining was observed in tissue from the respiratory tract. epithelial cells of the intestine rely almost exclusively on IFN- for antiviral defense. adult wild-type mice were injected intraperitoneally with 100 g of polyI:C. intestinal tissue was harvested at 2 and 6 h post-treatment. expression of Ifna5, Ifnb and Ifnl2/3 was analyzed. mammalian reoviruses have a wide cell tropism and exhibit a low degree of species specificity. type I IFN signaling is of crucial importance for restricting systemic reovirus dissemination. in IFN-competent hosts, reovirus-induced disease is mostly mild [17,34,35] reovirus replication in small intestinal tissue was analyzed by virus titration. reovirus replication in small intestinal tissue was analyzed by virus titration. in feces was even higher than from Ifnlr1 -/- mice. reovirus antigen was almost exclusively found in IECs of Ifnlr1 -/- mice. reovirus was restricted to lamina propria cells in Ifnar1 -/- mice. reovirus replicates in epithelial cells of intestine and biliary tract. suckling mice are far more susceptible to rota- and reovirus-induced disease. reovirus replicates in epithelial cells of intestine and biliary tract. wild-type mice were infected orally with 5 x 106 pfu of reovirus T3D. reovirus replicates extensively in epithelial cells of intestine and biliary tract. no viral antigen was detected by immunostaining. reovirus type 3 may spread to the intrahepatic biliary epithelium (cholangiocytes) and to the brain, causing either liver disease or lethal encephalitis. reovirus-positive cells were present throughout the liver and detected adjacent to epithelial cells of the extrahepatic bile ducts of Ifnar1 -/- mice. no virus antigen-positive cells were present in either the liver or the bile ducts of wild-type mice. analysis of tissues from Ifnlr1 -/- mice that succumbed to the disease revealed destruction of the biliary epithelium, accumulation of virus antigen and blockade of the bile ducts. Ifnlr1 -/- mice failed to mount a proper IFN response on day 1. protective response in the gut is predominantly mediated by IFN-. timely IFN- production by epithelial cells drives rapid clearance of intestinal reovirus infection. suckling mice for reovirus antigen and Mx1 at 1 and 4 days post-infection. high levels of nuclear Mx1 were detectable in the majority of IECs. no Mx1 signals were detected in tissue samples from wild-type and Ifnar1 -/- mice at this time point. only a small fraction of villi were positive for Mx1 at this late time point. RT-qPCR analysis of ISG expression demonstrated that during enteric virus infection type I IFN cannot compensate for the loss of IFN-, leading to prolonged replication of the virus in epithelial cells. the intestinal mucosa possesses a highly compartmentalized IFN system that acts in concert to restrict enteric virus replication. the gut epithelium represents a unique cell compartment in the organism that does not strongly rely on IFN-/ for antiviral defense. we found that IFN-/ failed to protect these cells from infection with an enteric virus due to low expression of the IFN-/ receptor complex. ovirus replication in the gut is restricted by IFN-, whereas type I IFN controls norovirus replication in extra-intestinal sites. recent experimental evidence indicates a role of IFN- in virus control at various epithelial surfaces others than the gut [15,44]. however, it appears that the contribution of IFN- at these other sites, including the lung, is mostly inferior to that of type I IFN. plasmacytoid dendritic cells are very potent producers of biologically active IFN-/ and IFN- [17,46,47] but most other cell types are also able to express IFN genes upon virus infection. hematopoietic cells in the epithelium strongly expressed IFN- but not IFN-/ genes quickly after stimulation with poly (I:C) biliary atresia is a rare disease affecting one in 10,000 infants with etiology and pathology largely unknown. infection of mice with certain strains of rota- and reoviruses has been proposed to be associated with the disease in children. chronic virus infections, such as HIV or LCMV, can lead to lymphocyte dysfunction due to prolonged IFN signaling [20,65] or refractoriness to IFN stimulation in hepatocytes in case of HCV. the gut epithelium has lost the ability to produce and respond to IFN-/ due to its potential negative effects. mice were orally inoculated with 5 l of cell culture supernatant containing 5x106 pfu of virus. adult mice were intra-gastrically inoculated with 100 l of virus. sections were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with rabbit-anti-reovirus T3D antiserum. sections were stained for reovirus antigen and, simultaneously, E-cadherin to identify epithelial cells.
