{"summary": "EBOV enters and infects cells by macropinocytosis followed by fusion of its own membrane envelope with the membrane of a late endosome. GP is cleaved by cathepsins L and B in a late endosomal compartment, which is acidic and also contains the Niemann-Pick protein C1 (NPC1) that has been shown to be an intracellular receptor for GP. fusion peptides (or FLs in EBOV and several retroviruses) are essential for membrane fusion of these viruses. the conformation of the EBOV FL under mildly acidic conditions is very different from the inactive conformation at neutral pH. the pH sensor that triggers the change in shape and surface hydrophobicity of the EBOV FL is not known. mutant and wild-type EBOV FLs were cloned into the pET41 vector. mutants were created by site-directed mutagenesis using PfuUltra DNA polymerase. mutants were lysed by sonication for 10 min on ice. 5- and 16-DSA stocks were prepared in chloroform, dried on the bottom of glass tubes under a stream of nitrogen and resuspended by addition of 150 mM DPC. wild-type FL was added to give samples of 0.5 mM FL and 150 mM DPC in 30 mM sodium phosphate and 100 mM NaCl buffer at pH 5.5. liposomes containing 12.5 mM 8-aminonapthalene-1,3,6 trisulfonic acid (ANTS) and 45 mM p-xylene-bis-pyridinium bromide (DPX) were prepared by extrusion method. lipid concentrations were determined by the modified phosphate assay. cells were resuspended in HM buffer (20 mM Hepes, 20 mM MES, 130 mM NaCl, pH7.4) after 48 hours incubation, cells were centrifuged and clear media was taken and ultracentrifuged on a 20% sucrose cushion. all VLPs were analyzed by Western blotting for presence of EBOV GP and VP40. samples containing 5 m EBOV FL and 5 mM DPC in 1 mM Hepes, MES, sodium acetate buffer were prepared by dialyzing against pH 5.5. Mutagenesis, expression and purification of wild-type and mutant FLs was performed as previously described with slight modifications. ic acid (5-DSA, 16-DSA) stock were prepared in chloroform, dried on the bottom of glass tubes under a stream of nitrogen. wild-type FL was added to give samples of 0.5 mM FL and 150 mM DPC in 30 mM sodium phosphate and 100 mM NaCl buffer at pH 5.5. lipid mixing was a fraction of the maximum FRET relief observed with wild-type FL. liposomes containing 12.5 mM 8-aminonapthalene-1,3,6 trisulfonic acid (ANTS) and 45 mM p-xylene-bis-pyridinium bromide (DPX) were prepared by extrusion method. cells were resuspended in HM buffer (20 mM Hepes, 20 mM MES, 130 mM NaCl, pH7.4) after 48 hours incubation, cells were centrifuged and clear media was taken and ultracentrifuged on a 20% sucrose cushion. all VLPs were analyzed by Western blotting for presence of EBOV GP and VP40. EBOV FL and 5 mM DPC in 1 mM Hepes, MES, sodium acetate buffer were prepared by dialyzing against pH 5.5. the three-dimensional structures of this loop in the presence of DPC micelles were previously determined by NMR at pH 7 and pH 5.5. s shown in blue, acidic residues in red, histidines in green, hydrophilic residues in light green, and non-conserved acidic/hydrophilic residues in orange. previously identified hydrophobic patch residues highlighted in yellow are strongly quenched by 5-DSA and 16-DSA, but not by Gd-(DTPA) conserved residue Thr519 shows a similar, but less well expressed interfacial quenching pattern. conserved Gln551 also appears to be more interfacial than the spatially close-by and also cationic Lys510. a summary of these data depicts the relative water and lipid exposures of most residues of the EBOV FL. fusion of liposomes as measured by lipid mixing was reduced to 20% of wild-type. changing the conserved Thr519 or Gln551 to an Ala did not affect fusion. residues of interest are shown as stick models using the same color code as in Figs 1 and 2. the residues are grouped in apparent functional clusters: H516 or aromatic; D522 or positive charge; E540/E545/H549 group; and Thr519/Glu551/Asp552 group. the pH-dependent fusion activity of the FL was restored. fusion was greatly diminished when histidine was replaced by an alanine, arginine or tyrosine. the mutant is stable at all pH values down to pH 5.0 and become somewhat cloudy after repeated CD measurements at 21 M. Fig 3d shows that a glutamate is also tolerated in this position. the a) wild-type, b) H516A, c) H516R and d) H516Y mutants precipitated under acidic conditions below pH 4.5. we tested the most promising pH sensor mutants H516A and E540D/E545D. the double mutation showed a slight (20%), but not dramatic reduction in cell entry. these results confirm that the three residues His516, Glu540 and Glu545 are not the primary pH sensors. histidines have a pKa 6.0 when unperturbed by neighboring residues. other potential residues that might trigger the pH-dependent conformational change and fusion mediated by the FL include two completely conserved glutamates and two less well-conserved aspartates. the fusion data with mutations to the highly interfacial aromatic residues Trp, Tyr, and Phe support the notion that an interfacial location of the residue in this position is more important than its potential to be protonated at low pH or to be drawn deeper into the membrane by a hydrophobic residue in this position. the highly aqueous phase exposed Asp522 was also somewhat compromised in lipid mixing when replaced by an arginine. a final group of negatively charged residues concerns Thr519, Gln551, and Asp552, which are all located in a central section of the FL fist at pH 5.5. a possible and perhaps likely scenario is that the conformational change depends on distributed, but more subtle effects of pH on multiple residues in the EBOV FL. the most likely residues to be subject to such distributed effects are those we targeted in the present study. mutations could obscure our ability to detect pH-triggered conformational changes. a similar theme was previously observed with the simpler fusion peptide of influenza hemagglutinin. supporting information S1 Fig. Content release from POPC/POPG liposomes mediated by mutants H516Y, H516A, H516R, and E540D/E545D relative to content release mediated by the wild-type FL."}
