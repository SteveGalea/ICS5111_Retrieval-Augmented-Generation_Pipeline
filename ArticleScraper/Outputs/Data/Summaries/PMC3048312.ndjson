{"summary": "the chloroplast is one of organelles known as plastids in plant cells and eukaryotic algae. plastids and mitochondria are derived from formerly free-living bacteria. there are up to 300 plastids [7] in one plant cell. the plastid genome was determined to be circular double-stranded DNA through construction of complete genome maps. each plastid genome constitutes in almost all higher plant species of a large single copy (LSC), a small single copy (SSC), and duplication of a large (25 kb) region (IRs) plastid engineering (transformation) has been experienced mostly in the nuclear genome [24, 25]. scientists argued that since plastids are compared with prokaryotes, they can take up DNA as in bacterial transformation using naked DNA. plastid engineering involves the targeting of foreign genes to the plastid's circular DNA genome instead of chromosomal DNA. the advancement in the particle gun mediated transformation has enabled targeting the plastid genome for developing transgenic plants against many biotic (e.g. insects and pathogens) the dominant trait that attracted the most attention for plastid transformation is herbicide tolerance [28, 35, 56, 57]. the dominant trait that attracted the most attention for plastid transformation is herbicide tolerance [28, 35, 56, 57] plastids are inherited maternally in the majority of angiosperm species. they would therefore not be found in pollen grains of corps. plastid transformation could be a method of choice for generating improved transgenics. chloroplast transformation may slow transgene recruitment in two settings, but actually accelerate transgene spread in a third. the high ploidy number of the plastid genome allows high levels (up to 1-40% of total protein) of protein expression or expression of the transgene. plastid gene expression is more uniform compared to that of trangenes inserted into the nuclear genome. the number of species whose plastome can be transformed continues to expand. biolistic delivery of plastids requires enzymatically removing the cell wall. the major difficulty in engineering plastid genome is in generating homoplasmic plants in which all the plastids are uniformly transformed. this is due to the presence of about 10-100 plastids, each of which has up to 100 copies of the plastid genome, in one cell, that does not allow achieving homoplastomic state. the amino glycoside 3-adenylyltransferase (aadA) gene confers dual resistance to spectinomycin-streptomycin antibiotics. it is still the selectable marker that is routinely used efficiently for plastid transformation. different strategies have been developed to eliminate the necessity of using such selectable markers. plastid transformation technology offers solutions to the ecological and technical problems associated with conventional transgenic technologies such as outcrossing and transgene silencing. despite overwhelming odds, many attempts have been made to produce transplastomic plants expressing Bt toxin for increased resistance against insect pests. over-expression of cry2Aa2 operon in plastids proved effective in allowing broad-spectrum of protection against pests. expression of cry1Ab protein was detected in the range of 4.8\u201311.1% of total soluble protein in transgenic mature leaves. insecticidal effects on Plutella xylostella were also demonstrated in cry1Ab transformed cabbage. ptII [153] Nicotiana tabacum cry [88] Nicotiana tabacum cry9Aa2 [156] Nicotiana tabacum Cor 15a-FAD7 [157] Nicotiana tabacum DXR [158] Nicotiana tabacum aadA & gfp [60] Nicotiana tabacum Delta(9) desaturase [159] Nicotiana tabacum AsA2 [160] Nicotiana taba leracea gus & aadA [163] Lettuce gfp [164] Populus alba gfp [51] Brassica oleracea aadA & uidA [74] Beta vulgaris aadA & uidA [165] Crocus sativus CstLcyB1& CstLcyB2a [26] Arabidopsis transgenic tobacco plants that constitutively expressed both entC and pmsB in the plastid showed accumulation of salicylic acid that were up to 1000 times higher than that observed in wild-type tobacco. the transgenic plants generated did not show any adverse effects due to the high levels of salicylic acid. tobacco plants were transformed with cDNA for BADH from spinach. betaine aldehyde was converted to betaine by BADH. cDNA for choline monooxygenase from Spinacia oleracea was introduced into tobacco. DH grew in the presence of high concentrations of NaCl (up to 400 mM) the highest level of salt tolerance reported so far among genetically modified crop plants. a gene for CMO, cloned from spinach (Spinacia oleracea) was introduced into rice through Agrobacterium mediated transformation. the insect resistance genes were investigated for high levels of toxin accumulation from the plastid genome. despite overwhelming odds, many attempts have been made to produce transplastomic plants expressing Bt toxin for increased resistance against insect pests. cry1Ab protein was detected in the range of 4.8\u201311.1% of total soluble protein in transgenic mature leaves of the two species. a synthetic truncated cry1Ac gene was linked to the rice rbcS promoter and its transit peptide sequence (tp) for plastid-targeted expression. tabacum Bar & aadA [156] Nicotiana tabacum Cor 15a-FAD7 [157] Nicotiana tabacum DXR [158] Nicotiana tabacum Delta(9) desaturase [159] Nicotiana tabacum AsA2 [160] Nicotiana tabacum PhaG & PhaC [4] Solanum lycopersicon Lyc [42] Brassica napus aadA & cry aadA & uidA [165] Crocus sativus CstLcyB1& CstLcyB2a [166] Solanum melongena aadA [26] Arabidopsis thaliana pre-Tic40-His [167] Zea mays ManA [168] Disease Resistance Plastid engineering offers a new and effective option in development of plant varieties resistant to various bacterial and fungal diseases transgenic tobacco plants showed increased levels of resistance compared to wild-type plants. the plants generated did not show any adverse effects due to the high level expression of salicylic acid. gene transfer in plastids can provide a significant protection from various bacterial and fungal diseases. tobacco plants were transformed with cDNA for BADH from spinach. betaine aldehyde was converted to betaine by BADH. cDNA for choline monooxygenase from Spinacia oleracea was introduced into tobacco. the enzyme thus synthesized was transported to its functional place. the level of glycinebetaine in rice was low to the expectations. the author has given several reasons for the low productivity of rice and low glycinebetaine accumulation. glycinebetaine has a role as compatible solute. plastid transformation systems made possible oral delivery of vaccine antigens against cholera, tetanus, anthrax, plague, and canine parvovirus. plastid engineering can be regarded as an attractive strategy and environmentally friendly approach for the production of vaccines, therapeutic proteins, and biomaterials. a third reason is the high-level production of antigens for use as vaccines. oral delivery of plastid-derived therapeutic proteins eliminates cold storage, cold transportation, expensive purification steps, and hence decrease their cost. edible vaccines are composed of antigenic proteins and are devoid of pathogenic genes. edible vaccines are composed of antigenic proteins and are devoid of pathogenic genes. pagA gene encoding protective antigen (PA) from the tobacco plastid genome gave rise to stable antigen protein [112, 113] plastid-derived PA was equally effective in cytotoxicity assays as the bacterial protein produced in B. anthracis. different constructs were designed to express the p27 Nef protein either alone or as p24-Nef or Nef-p24 fusion proteins. in 2007, Chebolu and Daniell [117] achieved a stable expression of Gal/GalNAc lectin of Entamoeba histolytica in transgenic chloroplasts. the structural protein E2 of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) has been shown to carry critical epitopes CFSV E2 gene in tobacco chloroplasts. bacco plastids transformation was also evaluated by lentz et al. [123] for the production of a highly immunogenic epitope containing amino acid residues 135-160 of the structural protein VP1 of the foot and mouth disease virus. the authors concluded that this technology allows the production of large quantities of immunogenic proteins. plastid engineering has been extended to some agronomically important crops. plastid transformation has been proved to result in high levels of transgene expression. there is no doubt that plastid engineering holds a great potential in plant biotechnology."}
