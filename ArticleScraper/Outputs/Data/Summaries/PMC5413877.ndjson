{"summary": "disease outbreaks caused by emerging pathogens have focused the attention of the media, the public and policy-makers on the causes of disease emergence [1\u20134]. anthropogenic change, particularly land-use change, affects the dynamics of endemic wildlife zoonoses and spillover risk to humans. a series of large-scale analyses spanning multiple disease systems suggest that more diverse systems pose a greater hazard. a hazard is a potential source of harm, while risk is the likelihood of adverse events (e.g. disease outbreaks) caused by exposure to a hazard (e.g. pathogen), potentially weighted by the severity of the adverse event (e.g. expected number of cases) the term risk factor can be used to describe factors that either increase or decrease risk. hazard, vulnerability, severity and impact to humans from microbial hazards are defined as potential sources of harm from microbes, such as viruses, bacteria and other pathogens. exposure represents the likelihood of contact between humans and the hazards, and vulnerability represents the possibility given exposure that the microbial hazard can actually cause harm. pigs can transmit the virus to other pigs, particularly efficiently, and transmit it to human farm workers. the outbreak led to a reduction in pig farming in Malaysia and adoption of risk reduction practices at the remaining pig farms. disease hazards related to biodiversity Around half of all known infectious agents of humans (and the majority of EIDs) are carried by animals (i.e. are zoonoses), and most emerging zoonoses originate in wildlife. hazard presented by diversity of microparasites (e.g. viruses and bacteria) and macroparasites (e.g. helminths and protozoa) can be pathogenic to humans. for many zoonotic pathogens, contact with wildlife reservoirs and vectors is a key risk [22,23] for many zoonotic pathogens, contact with wildlife reservoirs and vectors is a key risk. this is in part because \u2018host-jumping\u2019 is the process by which a pathogen infects a novel host. this can include exposure to vectors that can switch between wildlife and humans. greater biodiversity is expected to increase the hazard of emerging infectious diseases. host diversity is correlated with pathogen diversity, which is often assumed to predict hazard. but this relationship should not be expected that it would be predictive of disease risk at all scales or in all systems. anthropogenic impacts include reductions of native biodiversity (e.g. native fruit trees with geographically different seasonal availability requiring bat migration) and changes in reservoir host population demography and behaviour. anthropogenic impacts increased the risk by reducing local diversity, altering the dynamics of the pathogen to increase its prevalence in bats, and increasing contact among humans, livestock and bats. land-use change can also introduce human-associated invasive species (rats, cats, pigs, etc.) these human-associated species can act as bridge hosts, increasing zoonotic transmission via contacts with both humans and wildlife. humans directly involved in land-use change activities (e.g. deforestation, dam construction, agriculture and mining) generally have higher contact with wildlife. if the high-biodiversity area is left intact, it may present less risk, despite higher pathogen hazards. conservation corridors can increase movement between patches in a metapopulation. but other movement rates can maximize the endangered species population size. anthropogenic changes that reduce biodiversity can increase the risk of disease, either directly or indirectly. deciphering the concept of hazards and risks could shed a new light on the possible best-management options. anthropogenic impacts alter ecological processes and convert microbial hazards in naturally occurring pathogen diversity into risks to the health of humans and other species. we recommend that disease ecology incorporate more diverse approaches that embrace the confounded nature of the drivers of disease spillover and biodiversity loss. the UN Convention on Biological Diversity defines biological diversity as \u2018the variability among living organisms from all sources including terrestrial, marine and aquatic ecosystems\u2019. this includes diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems. vertebrate animals and humans."}
