{"summary": "a febrile child in sub-saharan africa may have a mild self-resolving viral infection or may be suffering from bacterial sepsis or malaria. this strategy changed in 2010 following revised guidelines from the world health organization. however, standard recommendations for management of febrile children who do not have malaria are lacking. advances in genome sequencing hold promise for addressing global infectious disease challenges by enabling unbiased detection of microbial pathogens. 66 (70.2%) were female. top admitting diagnoses were respiratory tract infection (57.4%), gastroenteritis/diarrhea (29.8%), and septicemia (1.7%). mNGS of serum At least one microbe was detected in 60 (66.7%) of the serum samples. no microbial species were identified in the serum of 30 (33.3%) individuals. mNGS detected Plasmodium falciparum (46, 51.1%) and parvovirus B19 (4, 4.4%). multiple viruses were detected from serum in patients with Plasmodium infections. three of the four identified parvovirus B19 cases were associated with P. falciparum. a prior study has reported a higher abundance of TTV in children with fevers. an coronavirus, coxsackievirus A2, coxsackievirus B2, polyomaviruses (KI), HHV-6 and HHV-7. hepatitis A virus, hepatitis B virus, parvovirus B19, mamastrovirus 1, and betapapillomavirus were found in 49 (54.4%) NP swab samples. mNGS of stool Among the 10 stool samples collected and sequenced, potential non-bacterial pathogens were detected in 9/10 samples. seven children had additional microbes identified: two rotavirus A and human parechovirus, and one each rotavirus A and Cryptosporidium, rotavirus A and enterovirus, Cryptosporidium and human parechovirus. the novel virus shared 44.9\u201355.1% amino acid identity with the closest known relatives. the virus was isolated from a patient from Nyangole village, Tororo District. unique HRV types are defined by 73% similarity in the VP1 gene. one individual harbored two distinct HRV-A types. a ser->Thr substitution was observed at amino acid 136. 94 children admitted to the hospital were enrolled (Table 1). their mean age was 16.4 (IQR: 8.0\u201321.0) months. 66 (70.2%) were female. top admitting diagnoses were respiratory tract infection (57.4%), gastroenteritis/diarrhea (29.8%), and septicemia (1.7%) ic analysis was carried out using the IDseq pipeline, a cloud-based platform designed for detection of microbes from metagenomic data. mNGS of serum At least one microbial species was detected in 60 (66.7%) of the serum samples; more than one microbe was detected in 11 (12.2%) samples. results for GB virus C and torque teno virus, which are of uncertain clinical significance, are not included. multiple viruses were detected from serum in patients with Plasmodium infections (10 of 46 (21.7%) samples. other respiratory viruses identified included influenza A (H1N1), HRV-B, human mastadenovirus B (type 7), three human parainfluenza virus types (type 1, 3 and 4), metapneumovirus, coronavirus NL63, avian coronavirus, coxsackievirus A2, coxsackievirus B2, polyomaviruses (KI), HHV-6 and HHV-7. mNGS identified respiratory viral co mNGS of stool Among the 10 stool samples collected and sequenced, potential non-bacterial pathogens were detected in 9/10 samples. seven children had additional microbes identified: two rotavirus A and human parechovirus, and one each rotavirus A and Cryptosporidium. malaria and pneumonia contained a novel orthobunyavirus in addition to P. falciparum. the novel virus was significantly divergent from known orthobunyaviruses, sharing 44.9\u201355.1% amino acid identity. unique HRV types are defined by 73% similarity in the VP1 gene. one individual harbored two distinct HRV-A types. one individual harbored two distinct HRV-A types. three of the four major epitopes (150 loop, 160 loop and 190 helix) and their surrounding regions were 100% identical. a Ser->Thr substitution was observed at amino acid 136 (in the 120 loop) compared to the B/Massachusetts/02/2012-like virus. Plasmodium falciparum was identified in the serum of 51.1% of the children. human rhinoviruses A and C dominated in the nasopharyngeal swab of 40% of the children. for 20% of NP swabs and 33.3% of serum samples, no microbial species met thresholds for detection. HRV-C was the most commonly identified virus in NP swab samples. we identified two novel HRV-C species which were 70% identical to the most closely related previously described HRV-C species. a lethal HRV-C outbreak was reported in chimpanzees in western Uganda. unbiased inspection of microbial sequences from sera revealed a novel member of the orthobunyavirus genus, tentatively named Nyangole virus. the virus was surprisingly divergent from known viruses, with an average amino acid similarity of 51.6% to its nearest known relatives. the WHO recommended vaccine for 2013/2014 was highly conserved to the virus present in Uganda during that season. the results are not necessarily representative of pathogens infecting Ugandan children. the lack of identification of bacteremia in study subjects may have been due to a relative paucity of severe illness. our study provides an important snapshot of causes of fever in african children that could not be identified by available diagnostics. mNGS will continue to yield an increasingly rich portrait of microbial diversity associated with disease in this region. NP swab samples collected with FLOQSwabs swabs (COPAN) were placed into cryovials with Trizol (Invitrogen), and stored at -80\u00b0C within 5 min of collection. samples were stored at -80\u00b0C until shipment on dry ice to UCSF for sequencing. IDseq is a scalable and cloud based implementation of a previously published pipeline. initial host read filtering is performed using Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) algorithm [17], followed by removal of duplicate/low quality and low complexity sequences [16], [16]. reads that were identified as HHV-5 were assessed individually using BLAST, to verify specificity to this virus. nasopharynx and intestines are normally colonized with commensal bacteria. nasopharynx and intestines are normally colonized with commensal bacteria. only non-bacterial species were reported. assembled contigs were queried against the national center for biotechnology information (NCBI) nucleotide (nt) database using the basic local alignment search tool. geneious v10.3.2 was used to annotate newly assembled genomes. nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples were collected from 90 children each. 45 (47.9%) of the children had a presenting symptom of diarrhea. malaria blood smear readings represent routine standard-of-care rather than optimal quality controlled reads. RNA was extracted from clinical samples as well as positive (HeLa cells) and negative (water) controls. all IDseq scripts and user instructions are available at https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/idseq-dag. a Z-score was calculated for both nucleic acid and protein alignments. only human papillomavirus was identified in the positive (HeLa cell) controls. nasopharynx and intestines are normally colonized with commensal bacteria. nasopharynx and intestines are normally colonized with commensal bacteria. nasopharynx and intestines are normally colonized with commensal bacteria. otide alignments were generated using default settings in MUSCLEv3.8.1551 [65], and ModelTest-NGv0.1.5 was used to identify the best-fitting evolutionary model. annotation of protein domains in the novel orthobunyavirus was performed using the interPro webserver [67] and direct alignment against previously known orthobunyaviruses. 1.1MB, tif) S3 Fig. Complete phylogenetic tree of Medium (M) segment polyprotein encoding Gn, NSm and Gc proteins.
