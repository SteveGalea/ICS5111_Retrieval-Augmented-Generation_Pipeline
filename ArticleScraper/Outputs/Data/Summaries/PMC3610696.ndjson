{"summary": "hTIM1 (hTIM1), a protein previously implicated as a receptor for the non-enveloped hepatitis A virus, also functioned as a receptor for the enveloped viruses Ebola and marburg. hTIM1 was identified by correlating gene expression patterns of 60 cancer cell lines with their permissiveness to EBOV entry [5]. the ectodomain of TIM proteins includes an N-terminal variable immunoglobulin-like (IgV) domain and a stalk-like mucin domain that varies in length and O-glycosylation. the IgV domains of all hTIM proteins contain a high-affinity binding site for PS, a phospholipid constituent of eukaryotic membranes [21], [22]. the entry of lentiviral pseudoviruses bearing the GPs of Sindbis (SINV), Ross River (RRV) and Baculo virus was enhanced in a PS-dependent manner by the TAM receptor tyrosine kinase Axl. hTIM1 promoted infection by a range of viruses, including members of the filovirus, flavivirus, alphavirus and new world arenavirus families. hTIM1 and related proteins function as attachment factors for a full range of enveloped viruses. plasmids HEK293T (human embryonic kidney), hepatocarcinoma, 3T3 (murine embryonic fibroblast) and MDCK (canine kidney) cells were grown at 37\u00b0C in DMEM. the plasmids encoding the entry glycoprotein precursors of Zaire EBOV (Mayinga) and Lake Victoria MARV (Musoke) were previously described. the precursor of the Oliveros virus (OLIV) entry protein was synthesized by GenScript based on genebank ID AAC54654.1. expression of receptors was assessed with monoclonal antibodies. cells were stained with anti-mTIM1 antibody (clone 219211, R&D Systems) or purified mouse Fc as a negative control. primary antibody binding was detected with a phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) plasmid encoding eGFP together with two other plasmids was co-transfected. cells were plated on poly-lysine-coated (293T) or uncoated 48-well plates and incubated at 37\u00b0C with pseudovirus- or VLP-containing supernatants. CRV (TRVL 11573), RRV (T-48) and SINV (Ar-339) were purchased from ATCC, and resuspended in PBS according to the instruction. type 2 infectious dengue virus (DENV, new Guinea C) was obtained by passaging in C6/36 Aedes albopictus mosquito cells. pCAGGS-based plasmid encoding a previously described GFP-fusion version of the EBOV VP40 matrix protein. the VP40-GFP plasmid was cotransfected with an empty plasmid. pQCXIX-eGFP was replaced with the same vector encoding a non-fluorescent protein. uninternalized VLPs and virions were removed with two 1 min acid-washes. internalization of VLPs or pseudovirions was assessed by flow cytometry. entry assays with VP40-lactamase VLPs and macrophages were produced. liposomes were made by sonicating milky lipid suspensions to clarity. liposomes were preincubated with cells for 20\u201330 min at room temperature. cell lines and plasmids were grown at 37\u00b0C in DMEM supplemented. fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S) were kept at 37\u00b0C in DMEM/F12 with 5% FBS and 1% P/S. hAxl cDNA (clone 5205825, Invitrogen) was purchased and similarly cloned into pQCXIX with an N-terminal myc-tag. the plasmids encoding the entry glycoprotein precursors of Zaire EBOV (Mayinga) and Lake Victoria MARV (Musoke) were previously described. also previously described were the expression plasmids encoding the entry glycoprotein precursors of Zaire EBOV (Mayinga) and lake Victoria MARV (Musoke) both lacking the mucin domains. cells were stained with anti-mTIM1-PE, a PE-conjugated rat anti-mTIM1 antibody (clone RMT1-4, BioLegend) or with anti-mIFN-PE, a PE-conjugated rat anti-mouse interferon gamma antibody (BioLegend) cells transfected or transduced to express exogenous receptors were stained. cells were plated on poly-lysine-coated (293T) or uncoated 48-well plates. incubated at 37\u00b0C with pseudovirus- or VLP-containing supernatants. independent experiments performed with independent pseudovirus and VLP preparations. infectious FLUAV (H1N1, A/PR/8/34) was propagated in MDCK cells [45], 0.45 m-filtered and virus titers assessed as tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50) in cultured human macrophages. cells were incubated for 1\u20136 h at 37\u00b0C with viruses serially diluted in DMEM containing 10% FBS, washed and supplemented with fresh medium. VLP-containing culture supernatants harvested at 36 h post-transfection. cell debris removed by two consecutive centrifugations at 900 g. presence of fluorescent filovirus-like particles in the supernatants confirmed. vLPs made with EBOV VP40 matrix proteins fused to -lactamase (Bla) and bearing EBOV GP, LASV GP or no GP were produced as described above for VP40-GFP VLPs. peritoneal cavity cells were incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C in RPMI containing 10% FBS, 1% P/S and 50 M -mercaptoethanol. liposomes were made by sonicating milky lipid suspensions to clarity. liposome preparations were diluted in the appropriate medium containing 10% FBS and preincubated with cells for 20\u201330 min. independent experiments were performed with independent liposome preparations. hTIM1 overexpression in 3T3 cells had a less dramatic impact on viral entry. hTIM1 supports the entry of a wide range of pseudoviruses. hTIM1 promotes infection mediated by a range of viral entry. 293T and control cells were stained with anti-hTIM1 antibody (red) or with mFc (black) unstained cells (black) and cells stained with anti-mIFN-PE (blue) served as negative controls. exogenous hTIM1 increases the entry of various pseudoviruses in 293T cells. 48 h later cells were infected with MLV pseudoviruses or WNV VLPs. an anti-hTIM1 antibody inhibits entry of various pseudoviruses in Huh7 cells. h7 cells were incubated with antibodies and infected as in E. infection levels were assessed 48 h later as in C. hTIM1 enhances infection of diverse replication-competent viruses. 293T cells transduced with hTIM1 or hACE2 (mock) were infected for 1\u20136 h with infectious TCRV (A), RRV (B), SINV (C), H1N1 (D) at increasing titers. trypsinized the following day (D and E) or 2 days later (A, B and C) stained either with immune ascitic fluids (A, B and C) or with anti-FLUAV (D) or anti-DENV (E) antibodies. hTIM1-mediated enhancement of pseudovirus and VLP entry is PS dependent. expression levels of hTIM1 and AA-hTIM1 were assessed as in Figure 1A. hTIM1-mediated viral entry enhancement is efficiently blocked by PS-containing liposomes. entry was quantified as in A and normalized to those of untreated hTIM1-expressing cells. hTim1-mediated virion internalization is independent of viral entry proteins PS dependency of viral hTIM1 usage implies that virions lacking any viral entry protein should also bind to and internalize into the intracellular compartments of hTIM1-expressing cells. results showed that virions lacking any viral entry protein are bound and internalized by hTIM1 in a manner that is independent of specific viral entry proteins. 293T cells transduced with hACE2 (mock), hTIM1 or AA-hTIM1 were infected for 6 h. the supernatant of cells expressing only GFP (mock supernatant) served as negative control. uninternalized VLPs were detached by acid-stripping and extensive trypsinization, after which internalized VLPs were detected by flow cytometry. hTIM1-mediated pseudovirus internalization does not always coincide with TIM1-mediated entry enhancement. some pseudoviruses that do not use hTIM1 for productive entry are still efficiently internalized by hTIM1. hTIM1-mediated pseudovirus internalization is blocked by PS-containing liposomes. 293T cells were preincubated for 20 min at room temperature with medium alone (none) or with liposomes consisting of either 50% PS and 50% PC (PS/PC) or PC alone (PC) hTIM1 or hACE2 were preincubated for 20 min at room temperature with increasing concentrations of anti-hTfR1 antibody ch128.1. MACV or LASV pseudoviruses were then added for a 1 h infection at 37\u00b0C. infection levels were assessed the following day as in A. the entry of MACV pseudovirus into TIM1-expressing 293T cells was as strongly inhibited by the anti-hTfR1 antibody ch128.1 [51] as in control cells. limiting the availability of the high affinity receptor does not increase TIM1 usage. a number of human PS receptors have been described [25]. different PS receptors tend to enhance infection of the same viruses. but not every virus uses every PS receptor. other PS-binding receptors also promote entry of hTIM1-using pseudoviruses. VP40-Bla VLPs bearing the entry proteins of EBOV, LASV, or no GP (negative control) were then added for a 2 h infection at 37\u00b0C. cells were detached, washed, loaded with the Bla substrate CCF2-AM, washed again and analysed by flow cytometry. we therefore assessed the contribution of PS receptors to viral entry in mouse peritoneal macrophages. hTIM1-mediated EBOV and MARV entry is dependent on the presence of the intracellular receptor NPC1 (NPC1/mNPC1). hTIM1-mediated EBOV and MARV entry is dependent on the presence of the intracellular receptor NPC1 (NPC1/mNPC1). hTIM1 promotes pseudovirus and VLP entry mediated by a range of viral entry proteins. cells engineered to overexpress hTIM1: human 293T and murine 3T3 cells. hTIM1 promotes pseudovirus and VLP entry mediated by a range of viral entry proteins. hTIM1 overexpression in 3T3 cells had a less dramatic impact on viral entry. only EBOV, AMAV, TCRV, JUNV and MACV pseudoviruses showed a moderate increase. hTIM1 promotes infection mediated by a range of viral entry proteins. plasmids expressing hTIM1 or, as a negative control, hACE2 were infected with MLV pseudoviruses or WNV VLPs. the following day, GFP expression was quantified by flow cytometry. hTIM1 usage by pseudoviruses was similarly assessed in 3T3 cells transduced with hTIM1 or hACE2. anti-hTIM1 antibody 3D1 inhibited the entry of EBOV, AMAV, TCRV and EEEV pseudoviruses by over 70% at a 10 nM concentration, indicating that hTIM1 serves as a major entry factor for these viruses in Huh7 cells. hTIM1 enhances infection of various replication-competent viruses. hTIM1 increases the infection of diverse replication-competent viruses. 293T cells transduced with hTIM1 or hACE2 (mock) were infected for 1\u20136 h with infectious TCRV (A), RRV (B), SINV (C), H1N1 (D) or DENV (E) at increasing titers. 293T cells were transduced with hACE2 (mock), hTIM1 or AA-hTIM1. hTIM1-mediated virus entry enhancement is efficiently blocked by PS-containing liposomes. hTIM1-mediated entry of pseudoviruses and VLPs is PS-dependent. entry was quantified as in A and normalized to those of untreated hTIM1-expressing cells. liposomes consisting of 50% PS and 50% PC blocked the entry of all hTIM1-using pseudoviruses into hTIM1-expressing 293T cells at 3 M concentration. unexpectedly, PE-containing liposomes also able to inhibit hTIM1-medated viral entry. control receptor were infected with EBOV VP40-GFP VLPs. those bearing no GPs were readily internalized by hTIM1. this bias is most likely due to the fact that the latter are released 3 to 5 times less efficiently from the producer cells. 293T cells transduced with hACE2 (mock), hTIM1 or AA-hTIM1 were infected for 6 h with purified and RT-activity normalized MLVgag-GFP pseudovirions. the supernatant of cells expressing only GFP (mock supernatant) served as negative control. hTIM1 promotes the PS-dependent internalization of H7N1 and SARS-CoV virions without leading to productive infection. internalization of LASV MLVgag-GFP virions was only minimally increased by hTIM1 (Fig. 5A) and was not blocked by PS-containing liposomes. 293T cells were transduced with empty vector (mock) or hACE2, followed by a second transduction with empty vector or hTIM1. infection levels were assessed the following day by measuring GFP expression. we tested this receptor-affinity hypothesis using the GPs from various SARS-CoV isolates with different affinities for the same receptor. hAxl and hTIM4 parallel that of hTIM1. hAxl and hTIM4 have a similar broad impact on viral entry. 293T cells expressing exogenous hAxl were infected with various pseudoviruses and WNV VLPs. hTIM3 expression resulted in a pattern of entry enhancement similar to that of hTIM1. 293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing hTIM3, hTIM4 or hACE2. hTIM3 and hTim4 are expressed efficiently. the same cells as in B were stained with anti-myc tag antibody. experimental infections in animal models have shown that macrophages are early targets for the replication of several viruses [55], [56]. we therefore assessed the contribution of PS receptors to viral entry in mouse peritoneal macrophages, which are known to express TIM4 [21] and other PS receptors. the previously reported non-permissiveness of NPC1/mNPC1 cells to EBOV and MARV [15] was not circumvented by hTIM1 overexpression. these data indicate that hTIM1 expression cannot overcome NPC1 dependence, confirm the role of NPC1 as a filovirus entry factor and suggest that hTIM1 itself may best be considered as an attachment factor. all pseudoviruses capable of using hTIM1 can also be enhanced by at least one other PS receptor, e.g., hTIM4 or hAxl. a functional, hTIM1 PS-binding domain was an absolute prerequisite for viral hTIM1 usage. flavivirus virions are occluded by tightly-arranged viral glycoproteins. flavivirus virions often incorporate immature glycoproteins [57]. this could lead to gaps in the glycoprotein coat through which PS becomes accessible. the same explanation may not fully describe the clear differences in TIM1 usage among EBOV, MARV, H7N1 and SARS-CoV. a second possibility, suggested by Morizono, is that high-affinity receptors may render hTIM1 use ineffective for some viruses. /pseudovirus showing strong TIM1-mediated entry enhancement in 3T3 cells. we showed for several pseudoviruses that TIM1-mediated entry depended on the availability of their cellular receptors. TIM1 was unable to enhance the infection of EBOV and MARV pseudoviruses. hTIM1, hTIM4, hAxl and potentially other PS-binding receptors can enhance the entry of highly divergent viruses. the enhancement conferred by all of these receptors is likely PS dependent and does not require any viral entry protein. in some cases, PS receptors may play critical roles in establishing or maintaining an in vivo infection. 293T or 3T3 cells are completely refractory to SARS pseudovirus entry in the absence of exogenous hACE2. 293T cells transduced with hTIM1 or hACE2 were incubated for 6 h with infectious TCRV (A), RRV (B) or SINV (C), or for 1 h with infectious DENV (D) hTIM1 was preincubated for 20 min with medium alone (none) or with liposomes consisting of either 50% PE and 50% PC (PE/PC) or PC alone (PC) liposomes and viruses were then added for a 30 min infection at 37\u00b0C. infection levels were assessed the following day by measuring GFP expression, and normalized to those of untreated hTIM1-expressing cells. the same cells as in B were infected with the indicated pseudoviruses. infection levels were assessed the following day by flow cytometry. text S1 Molecular causes underlying the inefficient viral usage of TIM3."}
