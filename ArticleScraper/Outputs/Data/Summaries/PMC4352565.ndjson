{"summary": "adenovirus has been associated with fatal hepatitis in sea lions. only in rare cases have adenoviruses been detected in cetaceans. no clear correlation was found between presence of the virus and disease status. gene sequence-based phylogenetic analysis supports common origin of adenoviruses that affect sea mammals. findings suggest need for vigilance against adenoviruses in captive and wild dolphin populations."}
