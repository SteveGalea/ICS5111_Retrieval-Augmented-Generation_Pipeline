{"summary": "the availability of respiratory viral panels by polymerase chain reaction (RVP-PCR) has provided a reliable means of diagnosis. a small number of studies analyzed the impact of RVP-PCR testing on clinical outcomes in pediatric populations. rapid respiratory panel (rapid RP) by Biofire FilmArray and the respiratory viral panel (RVP) by Luminex xTAG were used for the purpose of this study. the rapid RP is a multiplexed amplified nucleic acid test that uses a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for the qualitative detection and identification of multiple respiratory viral and bacterial pathogens. patients who were 18 years of age or older and had an RVP-PCR done within a year before this period were included in the rapid RP group. patients were included regardless of receiving empiric antibiotic therapy for a respiratory infection (ie, community acquired pneumonia, health care\u2013associated pneumonia, etc) this retrospective chart review was conducted at an 806-bed quaternary teaching hospital in manhasset, NY, USA. the study protocol was approved by the institutional review board. RVP-PCR molecular assays used for the purpose of this study are the rapid respiratory panel (rapid RP) by Biofire FilmArray and the respiratory viral panel (RVP) by Luminex xTAG. the rapid RP was more sensitive than the RVP and had a turnaround time much less than that of RVP. patients who were 18 years of age or older and had an RVP-PCR done within a year before this period were included in the rapid RP group. the Mann-Whitney U test was used for continuous factors such as LOS and duration of antibiotic use. the chi-square test was used for the secondary outcome while the Fisher exact test was used for other categorical factors. results were considered statistically significant at a P value.05.
