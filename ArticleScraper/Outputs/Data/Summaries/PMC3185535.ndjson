{"summary": "HRV RNA has been found in lower respiratory tract cells [1], the bronchial epithelial cells are susceptible to HRV infection [2], HRVs cause cytopathic effect. HRVs infect the airway epithelium, generate local and systemic immune responses, as well as neural responses. real-time RT-PCR We analyzed 386 sputum specimens derived from military recruits with or without pre-diagnosed asthma. out of 386 specimens 146 (37.8%) were tested positive in HRV real-time RT-PCR. all specimens were also studied with human enterovirus (HEV) real-time RT-PCR. positive specimens, 55 gave a positive result in the RT-PCR for genetic typing, while 91 remained negative. most of the genetically typed strains (62.1%) belonged to HRV-A. HRV-B strains accounted for 17.2% of the typed strains. 92.5% 1/21/2005 1442 HRV+/HEV+ HRV51 (HRV-A) 92.3% HRV51 (HRV-A) 88.4% 1/24/2005 1508 HRV+/HEV+ HRV51 (HRV-A) 93.4% HRV51 (HRV-A) 88.4% 1/26/2005 1499 HRV+/HEV+ HRV51 (HRV-A) 93.4% 1/27/2005 2208 91.6% 4/29/2005 1348 HRV+/HEV+ N27 (HRV-C) 98.2% 5/6/2005 1474 HRV+/HEV HRV44 (HRV-A) 91.3% 6/1/2005 2139 HRV+/HEV HRV26 (HRV-B) 92.8% 6/7/2005 2192 HRV+/HEV+ HRV55 (HRV-A) 85.0 % 6/7/2005 1544 HR HRV-A strains appeared to be a frequent finding in all age groups in both upper [18,20] and lower [15,21] respiratory infections. HRV-A strains HRV16 and HRV51 were detected several times during January 2005 and March\u2013April 2005. the biodiversity of circulating HRV strains by far outnumbers the commonly typed ones. the genetic distance between the strains was large (1.2\u201327.7%) this has been reported in other recent studies as well. the sputum in the specimens originated from bronchioles. the results may refer to the abundance of HRV RNA in the lower respiratory tract. the number of HRV-positive specimens in real-time RT-PCR was high (91/146) real-time RT-PCR We analyzed 386 sputum specimens derived from military recruits with or without pre-diagnosed asthma. out of 386 specimens 146 (37.8%) were tested positive in HRV real-time RT-PCR. the results did not differ between the asthmatics and non-asthmatics. genetic typing in the capsid coding region HRV-positive specimens was subjected to genetic typing in the VP4/VP2 genomic region according to a previously described method. 55 HRV-positive specimens gave a positive result in the RT-PCR for genetic typing, while 91 remained negative. most of the genetically typed strains (62.1%) belonged to HRV-A. 2039 HRV+/HEV+ HRV87 (HEV-D) 91.8% untypable 12/17/2004 1105 HRV+/HEV+ untypable HEV68 (HEV-D) 86.3% 12/27/2004 2086 HRV+/HEV HRV95 (HRV-A) 92.5% 1/20/2005 1454 HRV+/HEV HRV51 (HRV-A) 92.5% 1/21/2005 1442 HRV 1454 HRV+/HEV+ HRV16 (HRV-A) 92.7% 4/18/2005 1344 HRV+/HEV N38 (HRV-C) 87.3% 4/18/2005 1499 HRV+/HEV HRV16 (HRV-A) 94.6% 4/20/2005 1525 HRV+/HEV HRV16 (HRV-A) 91.5% 4/28/2005 2323 HRV+/HEV HRV29 ( all studied strains gave a positive result in the semi-nested RT-PCR. three of these were HEV-D strains, while the other three were genetically closest to HRV51. HRV-A strains appear to be a frequent finding in all age groups. the hypothesis of a season-restricted epidemiology of HRV-B will require further study to cover several independent strains. one of the summer-HRV-B strains in this study (K1206_290704) has close genetic field relatives reported only in china. this may reflect the fact that strains possibly causing mild, self limited illness do not get caught in typing efforts when sample collection is limited to hospitalized patients. high seroprevalence suggests a wide circulation of HEV68. no other HEV strains were discovered among the sequenced strains. the sample collection does not provide a direct link to lower respiratory disease. the results may also be cross-reaction of the presumably HRV-specific real-time RT-PCR with HEV strains. the primers used in our genetic typing method for HRV do not recognize all species of HEV. it is possible that some \u201cHRV-positives\u201d are actually HEV positives. the protocol was accepted by the Medical Ethics Committee of Kainuu Central Hospital, Kajaani, Finland. all participants signed a declaration of informed consent. the specimen collection consisted of 386 sputum samples. the specimens were stored at 70\u00b0C prior to virological analysis. RT-PCR targeting partial 5\u2032-VP1 was performed for nine samples positive for HEV in real-time RT-PCR as described in [19]. sequences generated in this work have been submitted to GenBank under accession numbers GQ466456\u2013GQ466490. the specimen collection consisted of 386 sputum samples. the specimens were stored at 70\u00b0C prior to virological analysis. the viral RNA was isolated from 100 L of sample with RNAeasy mini kit. -PCR targeting partial 5\u2032-VP1 was performed for nine samples positive for HEV in real-time RT-PCR as described in [19].
