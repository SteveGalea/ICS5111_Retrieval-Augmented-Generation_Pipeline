{"summary": "MHV ns2 evades the antiviral activity of IFN in BMMs by degrading 2-5A, the activator of RNase L (9) sequence alignments between ns2 and VP3-CTD revealed a pair of HxT/S motifs. the amino acid sequences of these molecules were aligned against the nearest template of known crystal structure for the central domain of the rat AKAP7 (PDB ID code 2VFY) VP3-CTD produced a profile of reaction products with the expected degradation of (2\u2032-5\u2032)p3A3 to (2\u2032-5\u2032)p3A2, ATP, and AMP as a function of incubation time. however, mutation of the two predicted catalytic His residues of VP3-CTD (H718A and H797R) produced protein that was deficient in 2-5A degradation. mutant VP3-CTD, mutant VP3-CTD (H718A and H797R) and ns2 were transfected into human Hey1b ovarian carcinoma cells. cells were treated with poly(rI):poly(rC) to activate OAS. no 2-5A was detected in untreated cells transfected with empty vector. rotavirus VP3-CTD cleaves 2-5A in vitro and in intact cells. rotavirus VP3-CTD could compensate for loss of ns2 function in mutant MHV-infected B6 BMMs. chimeric A59-VP3 viruses expressing ns2H126R and either WT VP3-CTD or VP3-CTD were individually mutated (ns2H126R-VP3, ns2H126R-VP3H718A, and ns2H126R-VP3H797R) data are from one representative experiment of two, performed in triplicate and shown as the means SEM. chimeric virus ns2H126R-VP3, expressing VP3-CTD and a mutant ns2, replicated to nearly the same level as A59. ns2H126R-VP3, expressing VP3-CTD and a mutant ns2, replicated only to the same extent as ns2 mutant viruses, with a final titer almost 100-fold less than ns2H126R-VP3. mutant and chimeric viruses replicated efficiently, with similar kinetics and final titer, in RNase L/ BMMs. expression of VP3-CTD can functionally replace A59 ns2 during infection of B6 BMMs. degradation of rRNA by RNase L was apparent in cells infected with each recombinant virus. the titers of ns2H126R-VP3 virus reached 104 plaque forming units (PFU)/g tissue in B6 mice. ns2H126R-VP3H797R, expressing inactive PDEs, was undetectable. ns2 evades the antiviral activity of IFN in BMMs. AKAP7 contains a 2H phosphoesterase domain from amino acids 88\u2013292 that binds AMP. aligned template was then used to predict a structural model for VP3-CTD and ns2 using Modeller9V5. VP3-CTD is a 2\u2032,5\u2032-PDE that cleaves 5\u2032-AMP from the 2\u2032,3\u2032-termini of 2-5A molecules. the 2-5A substrate, (2\u2032-5\u2032)p3A3, was incubated with purified proteins: (A) CTD of SA11 VP3, (B) CTD of SA11 VP3H718A;H797R. a standard RNase L activation profile with (2\u2032-5\u2032)p3A3 produced a 50% effective concentration (EC50) of about 0.3 nM (2\u2032-5\u2032)p3A3. no 2-5A was detected in untreated cells transfected with empty vector and poly(rI):poly(rC) accumulated 2-5A as determined by RNase L activation. rotavirus VP3-CTD cleaves 2-5A in vitro and in intact cells. to test this hypothesis, we constructed a series of recombinant viruses using an infectious cDNA clone of MHV strain A59 (18) B6 or RNase L/ mice were infected (1 PFU per cell) and virus titered from the supernatant at the indicated times. data are from one representative experiment of two, performed in triplicate and shown as the means SEM. ns2H126R-VP3, expressing VP3-CTD and a mutant ns2, replicated to nearly the same level as A59. chimeric viruses expressing an inactive VP3-CTD replicated only to the same extent as ns2 mutant viruses, with a final titer almost 100-fold less than ns2H126R-VP3. degradation of rRNA was apparent in cells infected with viruses expressing ns2 H46A, ns2H126R, ns2H126R-VP3H797R, or ns2H126R-VP3H797R. rRNA remained intact in cells infected with A59 viruses expressing a functional PDE, either ns2 or VP3-CTD. two highly similar 2\u2032,5\u2032-PDEs capable of cleaving 2-5A and antagonizing RNase L are produced by two very different RNA viruses. ns2 is a nonstructural protein translated from a monocistronic mRNA, while the rotavirus 2\u2032,5\u2032-PDE is found as the C-terminal domain of a larger structural protein that also contains rotavirus capping activities. ns2 resides in the VP3 accumulates in viroplasms, sites of new particle assembly, RNA packaging, dsRNA synthesis, and secondary rounds of transcription. a non-particle-associated form of VP3 mediates its RNase L antagonistic activities. ns2 and VP3-CTD degrade 2-5A from the 2\u2032,3\u2032-termini of 2-5A molecules. a chimeric MHV recombinant expressing both VP3-CTD and an inactive ns2 PDE replicated to nearly the same level as A59 in B6 mice. a chimeric virus expressing both mutant ns2 and mutant VP3 (ns2H126R-VP3H797R) failed to replicate at the lower level of detection. species of rotavirus (RVA-RVH) have been proposed. all RVA strains encode a similar PDE domain. the presence of similar 2H-PDE motifs suggests a PDE domain is also present at the VP3 C terminus of RVB and RVG strains. RVAs encode a protein (NSP1) in addition to the VP3-CTD that antagonizes host innate immune defenses. NSP1 inhibits IFN production by promoting proteasome-mediated degradation of IRFs and -transducin repeat-containing protein (TrCP) endonuclease-phosphatase PDE12 (2\u2032-PDE) (36\u201338) are often insufficient to prevent RNase L activation in response to potent stimulation of OAS proteins by viral dsRNA. cellular enzyme AKAP7, however, is a 2H phosphoesterase family member with amino acid and predicted structural homology to both ns2 and VP3 (14) the 3\u2032 terminus of VP3 encoding 143 amino acids was amplified from the plasmid pBSmod g3(VP3-SA11) derived from SA11-4F virus strain and cloned into mammalian expression vector pCAGGS. the ORFs for VP3 and mutant VP3H46A; H126R CTDs were both mutated resulting in pMAL-VP3 and pMAL- Nase L was incubated with (2\u2032-5\u2032)p3A3 or 2-5A present in isolated nucleotide pools from cells. fluorescence was measured with a wallac 1420 fluorimeter (Perkin-Elmer) rRNA Cleavage was monitored in virus-infected B6 BMMs. murine fibroblast (L2), murine 17 clone-1 fibroblast (17Cl-1) and baby hamster kidney cells expressing MHV receptor (BHK-MHVRs) were cultured as described previously (18, 31). pC-ns2 and pMAL-ns2 used in this study were constructed previously (9). expression and purification of VP3 are described in SI Materials and Methods. the 2\u2032,5\u2032-PDE activities of ns2 and VP3 were determined with purified (2\u2032-5\u2032)p3A3 as substrate followed by HPLC to separate the substrate from the products (43) mice were killed after perfusion with PBS containing 0.75% BSA. livers were removed, homogenized, and titrated by plaque assays."}
