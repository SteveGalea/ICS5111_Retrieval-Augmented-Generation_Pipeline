{"summary": "coronaviruses (HCoVs) are positive-stranded RNA viruses from the Coronaviridae family. the virus can cause more serious pathologies, such as pneumonia, bronchiolitis, and meningitis (2\u20134) in vulnerable patients, the infection can cause more serious pathologies. HCoV-induced neuropathologies in humans are difficult to diagnose early enough to allow therapeutic interventions. to circumvent these limitations, we developed a model of HCoV neuropathogenesis by taking advantage of the natural susceptibility of mice to neuroinvasion by the widely circulating HCoV OC43 strain. HCoV OC43 invades the CNS through the neuroepithelium and initiates neuropropagation at olfactory bulbs. RESULTS HCoV OC43 invades the CNS through the neuroepithelium and initiates neuropropagation at olfactory bulbs. HCoV OC43 neuroinvasion of the CNS initiates at the olfactory bulb. representative histological examination (confocal imaging) of viral spreading after intranasal infection of 15-day-old C57BL/6 mice with 104.25 TCID50 (10 l) of the rOC/ATCC reference virus was performed. in the first group, intracerebral injection served as a positive neuroinvasion control. in the second, intranasal inoculation was used to achieve more realistic levels expected upon more natural delivery. at 5 days postinoculation, the brains were harvested, total RNA was extracted and the virus RNA copy number per gram of tissue was determined by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR. five-day-old mice were inoculated with HCoV OC43 by intracerebral (I.C.), intranasal (I.N.) or intralingual (I.L.) route. each circle represents a probed brain for a single mouse. blood and livers were also collected from the same mice. olfactory bulb, cortex, and brain stem of all mice were found to be positive for virus RNA by day 3. olfactory bulb, cortex, and brain stem of all mice were found to be positive for virus RNA by day 3. the infection globally resolved by day 5 in two mice. HCoV OC43 spike and nucleocapsid proteins are associated with axons in vivo. brains were collected from mice 5 days after intracerebral inoculation. sagitally sectioned, and stained for either III-tubulin and nucleocapsid protein N (A) or spike glycoprotein and nucleocapsid (B) HCoV OC43 forms a viral platform at the surface of axons in neuronal cell culture. surface spike was labeled on live LA-N-5 cells before fixation and then permeabilized (or not for E staining) and stained back for either total spike (using a monoclonal mouse antibody), total E, surface HE, or total N protein. surface spike was stained by indirect immunofluorescence at 24 h postinfection (568 nm, red) serial images were taken every 5 s to generate nearly continuous 15- to 20-min videos. similar results were obtained in PMNCs (Video S3) and using the nonneutralizing 3-2B.2 monoclonal antibody on LA-N-5 cells. the same procedures were performed on infected cells fixed before staining. single-platform 568/488-nm ratios were quantified and plotted. the same downward trend was observed on both cell bodies and axons. samples were analyzed by confocal microscopy (A) and the percentage of infected cells harboring spike on their axons was then determined (B) the error bars represent the range from the means from two independent experiments. HCoV OC43 propagation was monitored in a lateral coculture system. cells of interest were seeded on two distinct sets of coverslips. cells of interest were seeded on two distinct sets of coverslips. HCoV OC43 sustains cell-to-cell propagation in a coculture system. effector and target cells were cultured for 72 h postinfection. infected cells were incubated with a fluid or semifluid inoculum for 16 h. the propagation efficiency was plotted as the ratio between the percentage of infected cells at 72 h and the percentage of infected cells at 16 h. methylcellulose was used to increase density of the culture medium. a closer look revealed virus propagation in the vicinity of colonized areas. HCoV OC43 neuron-to-neuron propagation can be modulated. sensitivity of cell-to-cell propagation versus that of free diffusion of particles to various cues. both types of propagation were sensitive to the clone 4-3E.4 blocking antibody. the impact of the neutralizing antibody was less drastic in semifluid medium. however, we cannot exclude the possibility that the semifluid medium per se interfered with the neutralizing process. rOC/S183\u2013241 virus propagated 2 to 3 times faster than rOC/ATCC. rOC/S183\u2013241 virus propagated 2 to 3 times faster than rOC/ATCC. rOC/SG758R failed to propagate under semifluid conditions. rOC/ATCC tested the effect of microtubule-disturbing agents vinblastine (destabilizing) and paclitaxel (stabilizing) on HCoV OC43 propagation in both fluid and semifluid conditions. both drugs decreased virus propagation in a dose-dependent manner under semifluid conditions, indicating that microtubules are preferentially required for neuron-to-neuron propagation. LA-N-5 cells were treated with the indicated concentration of vinblastine (Vin) or paclitaxel (Pac) in fluid medium for 72 h. infected cells were then fixed and immunostained to determine the percentage of infection. HCoV OC43 invades the CNS through the neuroepithelium. the number of infected cells further increased at 4 dpi (Fig. 1D to F) this amplification coincided with the dissemination of the virus from the initial infection from mostly the olfactory bulb and piriform cortex at day 3 postinfection (p.i.) to other regions of the CNS at day 4 including the hippocampus and brain stem. HCoV OC43 could access the CNS through the olfactory neuroepithelium, the subepithelial nerves surrounding the upper respiratory tract, or the bloodstream. in the first group, intracerebral injection served as a positive neuroinvasion control. at 5 days postinoculation, the brains were harvested, total RNA was extracted, and the virus RNA copy number per gram of tissue was determined. mice were inoculated with HCoV OC43 by intracerebral, intranasal (I.N.) or intralingual (I.L.) route. at 5 days postinoculation, the brains were harvested and the M RNA copy number was assessed by quantitative RT-PCR. RNA was detected in the livers of only 3 out of 9 animals whose brains were HCoV OC43 positive. olfactory bulbs, cortex, brain stem, spinal cord, and blood harvested at 1 to 5 days postinfection were analyzed for the presence of viral RNA. some virus RNA was detected in blood at day 1 but quickly waned to undetectable levels by day 2. HCoV OC43 spike and nucleocapsid proteins are associated with axons in vivo and in vitro. the sequential nature of HCoV OC43 neuropropagation suggests a nonstochastic pathway of propagation within the CNS. a similar accumulation of virus material could be detected along III-tubulin-positive axonal structures. line previously used as a convenient model of human neurons (33, 47, 48), and in primary mouse neuronal cell (PMNC) cultures. colocalization of spike proteins with surface spike was found to be inconclusive because of the massive amount of N observed along the axons. HCoV OC43 spike platforms are static but temporally dynamic. kinetic analysis performed on synchronously infected LA-N-5 axons revealed spike detection precedes detection along the axons. this suggests trafficking toward the axons. dim green platforms arose during the hour between the two stainings. the fate of the viral platforms could be characterized using a ratiometric approach. infected cells were stained first with the polyclonal antispike antibody (red, 568 nm, green) the stability of the 488-nm signal is indicative of a steady-state balance between the efflux/influx of old and new spike glycoproteins. these data suggest that spike platforms are spatially static structures that dynamically self-renew. the error bars represent the range from the means from two independent experiments. cells were fixed immediately after the initial staining with the rabbit polyclonal antibody (red) and reimmunolabeled after the indicated time period. the absolute fluorescence signal per infected cell was plotted relative to that at time zero for each individual channel. HCoV OC43 sustains cell-to-cell propagation. the data support the notion of the passive long-range diffusion of virus particles in both neuronal and epithelial cells. the data support the notion of the passive long-range diffusion of virus particles in both neuronal and epithelial cells. the propagation efficiency was plotted as the ratio between the percentage of infected cells at 72 h and the percentage of infected cells at 16 h. methylcellulose was used to increase the density of the culture medium. a single-cycle assay over a period of 16 h in the semifluid medium resulted in an 99% decrease in the inoculum infectivity. methylcellulose successfully hinders particle diffusion. a similar trend was observed for HRT-18 cells (Fig. 6G) SNA-1 (from Sambucus nigra) had an exacerbated negative impact on cell-to-cell propagation compared to free virus diffusion. inversely, free virus diffusion was more affected by the wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) we also tested the effect of recombinant HCoV OC43 hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein. the overlay medium was supplemented with a nonneutralizing (3-2B.2) or neutralizing (4-3E.4) monoclonal antibody, a control isotype, or preimmune rabbit serum. LA-N-5 cells were seeded at 7,000 or 14,000 cells/cm2 before infection. data were plotted as either the ratio between infectivity for infected cells and the infectivity for the untreated controls. rOC/S183\u2013241 virus propagated 2 to 3 times faster than rOC/ATCC. rOC/SG758R failed to propagate under semifluid conditions. a single mutation on the spike glycoprotein is sufficient to abrogate specifically cell-to-cell propagation. both drugs decreased virus propagation in a dose-dependent manner. none of the drugs affected propagation in the epithelial HRT-18 cell line. fewer spike platforms could be observed upon a 24-h treatment with paclitaxel. neuron-specific requirement for microtubules indicates axonal transport plays an important role during neuron-to-neuron HCoV OC43 propagation. HCoV OC43 is naturally neuroinvasive and can disseminate within the CNS. the rare presence of HCoV OC43 in the liver of intranasally inoculated mice suggests that neuroinvasion occurs independently of the low level of systemic infection. the trigeminal nerve mainly follows a neuronal circuit which ends at the brain stem. the olfactory bulb is the first CNS tissue colonized upon intranasal inoculation. microscopy data show a clear hierarchal trend from the olfactory bulb toward the brain stem and spinal cord. HCoV OC43 propagation appears to have in vivo relevance for neuropropagation. despite these limitations, local neuron-to-neuron propagation in vitro appeared to be only twice less efficient. we hypothesize that freely diffusing founder viral particles initiate stochastic infections in naive regions of the brain. 3-2B.2) showed no neutralizing capabilities under either fluid or semifluid conditions. this observed staticity does not preclude dynamism. new viral products compensate for gradual loss of older proteins. transsynaptic propagation instead of a nonsynaptic stochastic secretion along the axons could apply for HCoV OC43 remains to be verified. our data suggest that propagation via diffusion of free particles and neuron-to-neuron transfer share several mechanistic similarities, as seen for other viruses. the HCoV OC43 spike amino acid 183 to 241 mutant reached the spinal cord even more efficiently than the reference virus. it raises the intriguing possibility that neuron-to-neuron propagation efficiency defines the outcome of infection by enabling the colonization of areas of the CNS, such as the spinal cord. animal care and use protocols were issued by the IACUC of INRS. all experiments with both wild-type viruses and mutant viruses (viruses with an S protein with a potential gain of function) were approved by the institutional biosafety committee (certificate 2013-07) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 100 M nonessential amino acids were differentiated into human neurons as previously described. 1.25 104 LA-N-5 cells were seeded in RPMI supplemented with 20% (vol/vol) FBS, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 100 M nonessential amino acids (Gibco-Invit cells were seeded at 2 105 cells/cm2 and grown on poly-d-lysine (final concentration, 50 g/ml)-treated glass coverslips in the same medium. cells were then seeded at 2 105 cells/cm2 and grown on poly-d-lysine (final concentration, 50 g/ml)-treated glass coverslips in the same medium. whole-brain tissue was shredded/lysed by extensive agitation in 1 ml QIAzol lysis reagent (Qiagen) supplemented with shredding beads. total brain RNA was extracted by the QIAzol-chloroform-propanol manufacturer's procedure.
