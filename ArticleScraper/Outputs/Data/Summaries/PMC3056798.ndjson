{"summary": "mutations of SLC26A4 are found in some populations in as many as 13.7% of deaf subjects. they include deafness at birth and fluctuating hearing loss that progresses toward deafness during childhood. the high incidence of this disorder provides a strong imperative to investigate the etiology of the disease. lack of pendrin affects fluid transport in the embryonic inner ear. pendrin is expressed in multiple epithelial cell types located in small domains throughout the inner ear. onset of pendrin expression and onset of pH changes associated with lack of functional pendrin are important toward an understanding of the role of pendrin in fluid transport. disruption of cochlear thyroid hormone signaling in Slc26a4/ mice leads to cochlear hypothyroidism in the early postnatal phase of development. stretching of epithelial cells can be expected to lengthen diffusional distances, which would dampen or delay the arrival of diffusional signals. genetic drift was limited by occasional back-crossing to the original strain, 129SvEvTac. the colony was maintained free of known and suspected murine pathogens. epizootic diarrhea of infant mice virus - a mouse rotavirus. older mice (P7) were anesthetized solely by i.p. injection of 0.013 ml/g body weight of 4% tri-bromo-ethanol. Embryos and postnatal mice were sacrificed by decapitation. serial sections throughout the entire cochlea were obtained embryos aged E11.5 and E14.5 and mid-modiolar sections were obtained from embryos between ages E15.5 and E18.5. sections were mounted on charged slides and blocked for 1 hr with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS-TX solution. confocal laser scanning microscopy (Aim, LSM 510 Meta, Carl Zeiss, G\u00f6ttingen, Germany) observations reported are based on at least three independent observations. endolymphatic pH and transepithelial potential were measured in vitro with double-barreled microelectrodes. agar cups holding 100 l were prepared with warm (37\u00b0C) weakly-buffered Ringer solution. the method was devised to minimize the contribution of electrode drift. three calibration solutions with different pH values were used. the colony was maintained free of known and suspected murine pathogens. genetic drift was limited by occasional back-crossing to the original strain 129SvEvTac. d recombinant parvoviral protein, rNS1) and Sendai (Sendai virus \u2013 a type 1 paramyxovirus) were used in the present study. time-pregnant dams were deeply anesthetized with 4% tri-bromo-ethanol. this day was set to E0.5. whole-mounts were blocked for 1 hr with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS-TX solution. isolated otocysts from embryos and isolated inner ear from postnatal mice were fixed at 4\u00b0C for 2 hrs. whole-mounts or sections were washed three times in PBS-TX. whole-mounts or sections were incubated for 1 hr at room temperature. whole-mounts or sections were incubated at room temperature for 20 min with phalloidin and 5 min with DAPI diluted with PBS-TX. measurements in the cochlea were made via a round-window approach. data were recorded digitally (DIGIDATA 1322A and AxoScope 9, Axon Instruments) the beaker was heated to 210\u00b0C and silanized by a 90 s exposure to 0.02 ml dimethyldichlorosilane (Fluka 40136) at RT. the shorter reference barrel was protected from silanization by sealing the open end with Parafilm. microelectrodes were baked at 180\u00b0C for 3 hrs. pendrin expression was found in transitional cells surrounding the sensory cells in the utricle, saccule and semicircular canal ampullae. the onset of pendrin expression in the anterior semicircular canal ampulla was at E16.5 (Fig. 2A\u2013D) in the saccule, the onset of pendrin expression in transitional cells was at E14.5 (Fig. 2A\u2013C) pendrin (red) was visualized by immunocytochemistry.

C\u2013D: Cross-sections of the basal turn of the cochlea from Slc26a4+/ mice at age P3. stria vascularis became visibly endowed with a network of capillaries. the diameter of individual capillaries was smaller in Slc26a4/ mice. at P3, tissue height of stria vascularis was lower in Slc26a4/ mice. expression of pendrin in the inner ear begins in the endolymphatic sac followed by the onset of expression in the cochlea and vestibular labyrinth. failure to express pendrin causes acidification of the luminal fluid in the cochlea and the endolymphatic sac. failure to express pendrin causes an enlargement of the endolymphatic sac that develop within 3 days of the failed onset of expression. the onset of pendrin expression in the endolymphatic sac at E11.5 coincides with the onset of H+ ATPase expression. failure to express pendrin causes luminal pH changes. similar observations have been made in the developing cochlea as early as E15.5. in the endolymphatic pH was found between Slc26a4+/ and Slc26a4/ mice. it remains undetermined whether this delay in luminal pH changes is due to compensatory mechanisms possibly consisting of a coupling between rates of ATPase-mediated H+ secretion and pendrin-mediated HCO3 secretion. failure to express pendrin causes stretching and retarded development of epithelial cells. the onset of the enlargement of the cochlea and the onset of the enlargement of the endolymphatic sac coincide at E14.5. the role of the vestibular labyrinth in the control of the cochlear lumen is limited to the phase of development prior to E16.5. the utricular duct, which connects the utricle to the sac, is closed after E16.5 [32] the enlargement impairs cell communication between mesenchymal and epithelial cells. stretching lengthens diffusional distances and thereby may impair cell-to-cell communication among epithelial cells. this difference is most likely the result of differences in the epithelial rigidity. the retarded development of stria vascularis precludes normal function of stria vascularis in the postnatal cochlea. oxidative stress and a reduced endocochlear potential have been found in Slc26a4/ mice at P7. observation that pendrin protein expression was found to occur first in the endolymphatic sac is consistent with earlier investigations monitoring the onset of pendrin mRNA expression. the onset of pendrin expression at E11.5 coincides with the onset of H+ ATPase expression. failure to express pendrin causes luminal pH changes. no difference in the endolymphatic pH was found between Slc26a4+/ and Slc26a4/ mice. it remains undetermined whether this delay in luminal pH changes is due to compensatory mechanisms possibly consisting of a coupling between the rates of ATPase-mediated H+ secretion and pendrin-mediated HCO3 secretion. failure to express pendrin causes stretching and retarded development of epithelial cells. open lumen at E11.5\u2013E12.5 suggests fluid secretion in the vestibular labyrinth is present at this time. it is an attractive hypothesis to assume that the cochlea and the endolymphatic sac are \u2018pumped up\u2019 by fluid secretion in the otocyst that forms the vestibular labyrinth. the onset of the enlargement of the cochlea and the onset of the enlargement of the endo enlargement impairs cell communication between mesenchymal and epithelial cells. stretching lengthens diffusional distances and may impair cell-to-cell communication among epithelial cells. expression patterns of connexin 26 and Na+/K+ ATPase in K\u00f6lliker's organ and the outer sulcus region appeared qualitatively similar in Slc26a4+/ and Slc26a4/ mice. in development of stria vascularis between Slc26a4+/ and Slc26a4/ mice was most apparent at P3. oxidative stress and a reduced endocochlear potential have been found in Slc26a4/ mice at P7. stria vascularis undergoes degeneration at P30 including an invasion of macrophages."}
