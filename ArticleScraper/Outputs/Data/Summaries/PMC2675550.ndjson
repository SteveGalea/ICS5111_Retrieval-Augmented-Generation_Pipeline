{"summary": "the flying fox geographic range encompasses all locations where HeV and NiV have been found. paramyxoviruses are large, enveloped, negative-sense ssRNA viruses. they include such well-known members as measles virus (MeV), simian virus 5 (SV5) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) relapsing and late-onset encephalitis syndromes with significant fatality have been recognized following either acute NiV encephalitic episodes or non-encephalitic/ asymptomatic infection. relapsing and late-onset encephalitis syndromes with significant fatality (18%) have been recognized following either acute NiV encephalitic episodes. category C agents include high emerging pathogens with the potential for causing morbidity and mortality with major economic and health impacts. there are no specific antiviral therapies or vaccines available for treating or preventing NiV or HeV infection resulting from a natural outbreak, laboratory accident or deliberate misuse. a higher incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome in conjunction with encephalitis was also described. most paramyxovirus attachment glycoproteins (H) contain hemagglutinin and neuraminidase activities (HN), which do not bind sialic acid moieties. ephrin-B2 ligand was identified as a receptor used by HeV and NiV for infection [27, 28] and subsequently, ephrin-B3 ligand was identified as an alternate receptor for NiV [29] ligands play important roles in regulation of tissue assembly and cell migration [30] and are critical to brain function, neuronal networking and morphogenesis [32] a strong epidemiological association existed in Malaysia between human NiV infection and close direct contact with pigs, especially sick and dying animals. a strong epidemiological link has been noted between human NiV infection and close direct contact with pigs, especially sick and dying animals. guinea pigs developed generalized vasculitis affecting lung, kidney, spleen, lymph nodes, gastrointestinal tract, and skeletal and intercostal muscles. but in spite of vascular involvement of the lung, there was little or no pulmonary edema. in 8/15 guineapigs subcutaneously inoculated with 30,000-50,000 TCID50. Vasculitis, fibrinoid necrosis of vessels in multiple organs, oophoritis, endometrial necrosis. death 9 \u2013 29 DPI. fibrinoid necrosis of blood vessel walls, endothelial syncytia. antigen in bronchial and alveolar epithelium, syncytia and blood vessels. cytoplasmic inclusions composed of defined nucleocapsids typical of paramyxoviruses. but the pathology seen in the lungs and kidneys of infected hamsters differs from that seen in horses and humans. experimental HeV infection of cats has been performed. studies on cats that were euthanized early in the course of the infection indicated that alveolar infection by NiV preceded vascular infection suggesting an increased tropism for alveolar epithelium as compared to vascular tissue. experimental NiV infection in Pteropid bats has been attempted [39] a lower dose of 50 TCID50 failed to produce infection as defined by fever, illness, detection of virus, viral antigen or viral genome. a mild increase in respiratory rate in some animals was attributable to fever with one ferret showing tremors and hindlimb weakness. the golden hamster, cat and ferret are practical laboratory animal models. they can be used to evaluate aspects of disease caused by either HeV or NiV. they are more amenable to therapeutic efficacy testing than large domestic animals. ribavirin appears to be one available antiviral option. fatality approaching 75% in most recent NiV outbreaks in Bangladesh and india. viremia has been documented in both clinical and experimental infections. the use of safe and efficacious vaccines has been crucial to prevention strategies for several important viral pathogens in humans. there are some sixteen FDA-approved vaccines routinely used to prevent infection by virulent human pathogens. the majority comprise live-attenuated virus preparations (reviewed [57]) poxvirus vectors have emerged as licensed veterinary vaccines as well as candidate vaccines for humans. recombinant canarypox virus vaccines encoding NiV F or G successfully protected pigs from NiV challenge. recombinant, purified sG preparations have been shown to be ideal immunogens that retain a number of important functional and antigenic properties. the sG glycoprotein can also capture and isolate virus-specific neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from naive recombinant libraries. canarypox viruses encoding NiV F or G (pigs) 2 intramuscular doses (108 pfu per dose) 14 days apart None 29 days post immunization, 2.5 x 105 pfu NiV intranasally Viral load Cytokine production Antibodies (SNT) a natural route of infection should be used in protection studies. antigen-specific IgG and IgM were detected in all vaccinated animals. sG-specific IgA was present in serum from one high dose animal. titers were significantly lower to NiV as compared to HeV. antibody profiles of sG Vaccinated Cats HeV SNT Titer NiV SNT Titer sG-specific Serum IgG sG-specific Serum IgA HeV sG-Specific Mucosal IgA Control 1:32 1:2 - - - - - - - High dose 1:4096 1:512 + + + + High dose 1:2048 1:256 + + + Medium dose 1:4096 1:256 + + + hamsters were administered anti-NiV F or anti-NiV G polyclonal sera prior to challenge. mAbs were evaluated in lethal experiments in hamsters. when administered 24 hours post-challenge, only 50% of the animals survived. m102 was converted to a full length human IgG1 antibody. antibody could neutralize both HeV and NiV at concentrations as low as 10 g/ml. m102.4 could provide a valuable post-exposure or post-infection therapeutic for disease caused by HeV or NiV in humans. enfuvirtide is a 36-amino acid peptide corresponding to a portion of the gp41 subunit of the envelope glycoprotein. Peptide sequences derived from F glycoprotein HR domains of several paramyxoviruses, including HeV and NiV have been shown to be potent inhibitors of fusion. pegylation is considered one of the most successful techniques to prolong the residence time of protein drugs in the bloodstream. soluble ephrin-B2 ligand could block both ephrin-B2 and ephrin-B3 ligand mediated henipavirus infections in vitro. soluble ephrin-B2 ligand could block both ephrin-B2 and ephrin-B3 ligand mediated infections in vitro. EphB4 has no inhibitory effects on ephrin-B3 ligand mediated henipavirus infection. only EphB3 a natural receptor for ephrin-B2 and ephrin-B3 ligands was capable of blocking all henipavirus infections in vitro. the potential passive therapeutic efficacy of soluble ephrin-B2 ligand or EphB3 protein in an eled detection molecules and binding results were reported as median fluorescent intensities. sG coupled-microspheres have been used to detect ephrin-B2 ligand and G-specific human mAbs in sera. eled detection molecules and binding results were reported as median fluorescent intensities. panels A and B binding to soluble HeV G- and soluble NiV G-coupled microspheres are indicated by white and black bars. binding of antibody to peptide-coupled microspheres in the presence and absence of free peptide is indicated by black bars. passive antibody therapy is routinely used for prophylaxis. a major advancement in antibody technology has been the development of the phage display platform of combinatorial antibody libraries. phage display platforms encode antibodies in the form of single-chain variable region fragments (scFvs) and Fab\u2019 fragment m102 had significant neutralizing activities against both henipaviruses. antibody, m102.4, could provide a valuable therapeutic for disease caused by HeV or NiV in humans. fusion inhibitory peptides have been shown to be potent inhibitors of fusion. pegylation is one of the most successful techniques to prolong the residence time of protein drugs in the bloodstream. henipaviruses were synthesized with chemical modifications of either the N- or C-terminus of the peptide by capping and/or pegylation. soluble ephrin-B2 ligand could block both ephrin-B2 and ephrin-B3 ligand mediated henipavirus infections in vitro. soluble versions of both molecules are being explored as possible therapeutic drugs for human cancer. soluble ephrin-B2 ligand and EphB3 studies are being evaluated in vivo. soluble ephrin-B2 ligand and EphB3 studies will begin in the not too distant future. sera is already being used to measure heptad-derived peptides in plasma half-life experiments. peptide-specific polyclonal antibody and anti-rabbit-phycoerythrin molecules are detected. results are reported as median fluorescent intensities. avirus pathogenesis has lead to the development of suitable animal models of disease and potential therapeutics. successful vaccine candidates have been trialed in one animal model but still need to be evaluated in an independent animal model. most of the post-exposure therapeutic agents have only been tested in vitro and will require in vivo half-life studies. virus neutralization assays, drug characterization in vivo and efficacy studies still represent the most challenging phases of drug development for HeV and NiV."}
