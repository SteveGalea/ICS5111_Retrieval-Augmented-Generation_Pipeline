{"summary": "gastric cancer is the third leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. each year, almost one million new cases of gastric cancer are diagnosed. more than 700,000 people die of the disease. targeting the EGFR-mediated RAS-RAF1-MAP2K-MAPK1/3 signaling pathway is regarded as a promising strategy for cancer drug discovery. macroautophagy/autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved and highly regulated eukaryotic cellular degradation pathway for maintaining cell homeostasis via sequestering and targeting bulk intracellular components. w09-triggered autophagy induces autophagy in human gastric cancer cells. each compound was evaluated separately with fluorescence using high context image analysis (Acumen eX3) w09 is the most active derivative of the initial \u201chit\u201d compounds. w09 treatment resulted in apparent vacuolization in the cytoplasm of SGC-7901 cells. the w09-induced cytoplasmic vacuolization is also dose-dependent. SGC-7901 cells were treated with 10 M w09 for 6 h. representative microscopy images of SGC-7901 cells were obtained by transmission electron microscopy. the black arrow indicates autophagic vacuoles containing cytoplasmic context. w09 treatment significantly augmented the expression levels of LC3B-II in a dose- and time-dependent manner in SGC-7901 cells. w09 treatment also caused a dose-dependent conversion of LC3B-II and cytoplasmic vacuolization. pretreatment with 10 mM 3-MA for 1 h markedly reduced w09-induced cytoplasmic vacuoles. also significantly inhibited the conversion of LC3B-I to LC3B-II. treatment with 2 lysosomal inhibitors, chloroquine (CQ) or bafilomycin A1 (BafA1),33,37. blocks later steps of autophagy,18 to prevent autolysosome formation. expression of autophagy-related proteins, LCB3-I, LC3B-II and SQSTM1 was assessed by immunoblotting. quantification represents the relative protein levels of the cells normalized to ACTB (mean SD from 3 independent experiments) w09-treated cells stably expressing mCherry-LC3 were treated with the indicated drugs for 6 h. the protein level of w09-treated cells was gradually increased in a time-dependent manner during 12 h treatment. w09 induces autophagic flux in gastric cancer cells. the difference of mCherry-LC3 dots in HeLa (C) and SGC-7901 (D) cells was quantified with ImageJ. at least 20 cells of each treatment were used to calculate statistical significance using the Student t test (**p0.01). w09 induces autophagy through activation of the EGFR-mediated RAS-RAF1-MAP2K-MAPK1/3 signaling pathway in gastric cancer cells. signaling pathways mediated by MAPKs (MAPK1/3, MAPK11/p38-MAPK12/p38gamma-MAPK13/p38, and MAPK8/JNK1-MAPK9/JNK2-MAPK10/JNK3) have been implicated in the modulation of auto w09 induces autophagy via activation of the EGFR-RAS-RAF1-MAP2K-MAPK1/3 signaling pathway. SGC-7901 cells were pretreated with 10 M U0126 for 1 h. expression of autophagy-associated protein and autopahagosome marker LC3B-II was analyzed by western blot. phosphorylation levels of the MAP2K-MAPK1/3 signaling pathway of SGC-7901 cells were assessed by immunoblot analysis. expression levels of LC3B-I:LC3B-II were also detected by immunoblot analysis. w09 treatment resulted in a rapid activation of the EGFR-RAS-RAF1-MAP2K-MAPK1/3 signaling pathway in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner in SGC-7901 cells. these results suggest that activation of the EGFR-RAS-RAF1-MAP2K-MAPK1/3 signaling pathway plays an important role in w09-induced autophagy. w09 treatment markedly increased the accumulation of LC3B-II. EGFR plays a critical role in w09-induced autophagy. w09 induces caspase-dependent apoptosis in gastric cancer cells. w09 inhibits gastric cancer cell growth through the CASP8-dependent apoptosis pathway. w09 inhibits gastric cancer cell growth through the CASP8-dependent apoptosis pathway. apoptosis was analyzed using an ANXA5-EGFP and PI cell apoptosis kit. representative results from 3 independent experiments are presented. cells were treated as in (C), total protein was prepared and expression of apoptosis-related proteins was analyzed by western blot. classical apoptotic cells with nuclear condensation and fragmentation induced by 40 M w09 treatment of 48 h can be visualized in SGC-7901 cells by propidium iodide (PI) staining. w09 treatment induced apoptosis of SGC-7901 (treatment of 48 h) or HGC-27 (treatment of 24 h) cells in a dose-dependent manner. w09-treated GC-7901 cells on the cleavage of BID have not been observed in w09-treated cells. these findings suggest w09 may directly induce apoptosis of gastric cancer cells through an active CASP8-mediated mitochondria-independent apoptosis pathway. a pan-caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-fmk, can abrogate the apoptosis induced by w09. pretreatment with CQ or U0126 profoundly attenuated the cytotoxic effect of w09 on gastric cancer cells. results of clonogenic formation assays also confirmed that pretreatment with CQ markedly attenuated w09-induced cell apoptosis. western blotting analysis of the CASP3 cleavage fragment also confirmed that CQ and U0126 markedly attenuated w09-induced cell apoptosis. cells were pretreated with CQ (20 M) or U0126 (10 M) for 1 h, followed by coincubation with 20 M w09 for 48 h. cell apoptosis analysis was performed using ANXA5-EGFP. w09-induced autophagy and apoptosis in SGC-7901 cells. downregulation of ATG5 significantly suppressed cleavage of CASP3. knockout of ATG7 markedly rescued w09-induced cell death. w09-induced apoptosis in gastric cancer cells. cells were transfected with ATG5 or control (Scrambled) siRNA for 48 h. cells were then treated with 10 M w09 for 6 h. expression of LC3B-I to LC3B-II was assessed by western blot. w09 is markedly upregulated at protein levels in w09-treated gastric cancer cells. w09 treatment dose-dependently increased the expression of SQSTM1 mRNA levels. this suggests that the increases of SQSTM1 protein levels are attributed to SQSTM1 mRNA upregulation. the sequence 5\u2032-TGCTGAGTCAC-3\u2032 between nucleotides 1305 and 1295 is responsible for w09-mediated cell apoptosis in gastric cancer cells. w09 promotes SQSTM1 mRNA transcript in a dose-dependent manner. w09 inhibits the growth of gastric cancer in a mouse xenograft model in vivo. w09 inhibits the growth of gastric cancer in a mouse xenograft model in vivo. w09 effectively inhibited the growth of tumors in vivo. the changes in body weight of w09-treated mice were similar to those of the vehicle-treated mice, suggesting no significant toxicity of w09 at a dose of 40 mg/kg. w09 treatment caused a significant increase in immunoreactivity for cleaved CASP3 compared with control, suggesting the mechanism of in vivo antitumor of w09 is associated with induction of apoptosis. five M of w09 treatment resulted in only small-size vacuolization in part of cells. treatment with 10 M or higher concentrations of w09 led to massive vacuolization in all treated cells. w09 induces autophagy in gastric cancer cells. mCherry-LC3B is an effective way to detect autophagosomes by monitoring the distribution of mCherry-LC3B from a diffuse pattern to the accumulation of puncta in the cytoplasm. w09 treatment markedly increased the accumulation of fluorescent LC3 dots in cells, suggesting an effect of w09-induced autophagosome formation. w09 treatment significantly augmented the expression levels of LC3B-II in a dose- and time-dependent manner in SGC-7901 cells. w09 treatment also caused a dose-dependent conversion of LC3B-II and cytoplasmic vacuolization in other gastric cancer cells. the accumulation of LC3B-II in cells compared with w09 alone. w09, CQ or BafA1 treatment resulted in a marked accumulation of SQSTM1 compared with w09, CQ or BafA1 treatment alone. autophagy inhibitors blocked w09-induced autophagy in gastric cancer cells. y-related proteins, LC3B-I, LC3B-II and SQSTM1 of SGC-7901 cells treated as described in (B) were assessed by immunoblotting. the expression of SQSTM1 protein was analyzed by western blot. 10 M of w09 treatment caused markedly the accumulation of mCherry-LC3B dots in HeLa or SGC-7901 cells. an autophagy inhibitor, 3-methyladenine (3-MA), significantly blocked the formation of mCherry-LC3B puncta. w09-induced autophagic flux was further confirmed in cells transfected with a mTagRFP-mWasabi-LC3B reporter. compared with control cells, w09 markedly increased the number of red puncta (GFP RFP+) in w09-treated cells, while there were almost no red puncta (GFP RFP+) in the CQ-treated group. w09 induces autophagy via activation of the EGFR-RAS-RAF1-MAP2K-MAPK1/3 signaling pathway. we pretreated SGC-7901 cells with a MAP2K inhibitor U0126 for 1 h followed by 10 M w09 for 12 h. pretreatment with U0126 markedly abrogated the effect of w09 on phosphorylation of MAPK1/3. LC3B-II was analyzed by western blot, and its relative levels, normalized to ACTB (mean S.D) from 3 independent experiments (**P0.01) were quantified (C) the phosphorylation levels of the MAP2K-MAPK1/3 signaling pathway were assessed by immunoblot analysis. pretreatment with sorafenib, the first oral multikinase inhibitor, significantly prevented w09-induced cytoplasmic vacuolation. w09 treatment resulted in rapid activation of the EGFR-RAS-RAF1-MAP2K-MAPK1/3 signaling pathway in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. pretreatment with EGF promoted w09-induced cytoplasmic vacuoles. w09 treatment markedly increased the accumulation of LC3B-II. EGFR plays a critical role in the regulation of w09-induced autophagy. egfr-null CHO-K1 and CHO-K1 cells were treated with w09 for 6 h. expression of LC3B-II was determined by western blot analysis. w09 induces caspase-dependent apoptosis in gastric cancer cells. w09 treatment resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of clonogenic formation. cells were treated with various concentrations of w09 for 72 h. apoptosis was analyzed using an ANXA5-EGFP and PI cell apoptosis kit. w09 treatment induced apoptosis of apoptosis of apoptosis of apoptosis of apoptosis of apoptosis of apoptosis of apoptosis of apoptosis of apoptosis of apoptosis of apoptosis of apoptosis of apoptosis of apoptosis of a w09 treatment increased the cleavage of PARP1 (poly[ADP-ribose] polymerase 1), CASP9 (caspase 9), CASP8 and CASP3 by immunoblotting. w09 treatment increased the cleavage of PARP1, CASP3 and CASP8 in a dose-dependent manner in SGC-7901 and HGC-27 cells. pretreatment of cells with Z-VAD-fmk markedly reduced the w09-induced antiproliferative effect on SGC-7901 and HGC-27 cells. w09 treatment induced autophagy in a few hours and caspase-dependent apoptosis in gastric cancer cells. this led us to investigate the causal relationship between w09-induced autophagy and apoptosis. western blotting analysis of the CASP3 cleavage fragment confirms that CQ and U0126 markedly decreased CASP3 activation induced by w09. these data strongly suggest that w09 induced autophagy-dependent apoptosis in gastric cancer cells. total proteins of SGC-7901 cells treated as described in (D) were extracted. expression of cleaved CASP3 was detected by western blot analysis. quantification of cleaved CASP3 is presented as mean SD from 3 independent experiments. double knockout of ATG7 and ATG5 inhibited conversion of LC3B-I to LC3B-II. compared with wild type of SGC-7901 cells, double knockout of ATG5 and ATG7 markedly rescued w09-induced cell death. this significantly prevented the cleavage of PARP1 (Fig. 8F and G) wild-type SGC-7901 cells or SGC-7901 cells with ATG5 ATG7 double-knockout were treated with w09 for 48 h. w09 treatment dose-dependently increased the expression of SQSTM1. w09 promotes w09-mediated induction of w09-mediated cell apoptosis in gastric cancer cells. w09 promotes SQSTM1 mRNA in a dose-dependent manner. a knockout of SQSTM1 in the SGC-7901 cell line (D) and a SGC-7901 cell line lacking the SQSTM1 LIR domain (E) were constructed and the autophagic effect of w09 on these 2 new cell lines was confirmed by western blot. w09 inhibited the cleavage of PARP1 induced by w09. w09 inhibits the growth of gastric cancer in a mouse xenograft model in vivo. w09 inhibited the growth of tumors in a mouse xenograft model in vivo. w09 effectively inhibited the growth of tumors in vivo. w09 inhibits tumor growth in an SGC-7901 xenograft model. w09 treatment caused a significant increase in immunoreactivity for cleaved CASP3 compared with control. w09 induced autophagy and subsequent apoptosis in gastric cancer cells. EGFR-mediated activation of the RAS-RAF1-MAP2K-MAPK1/3 signaling pathway played an essential role in w09-induced autophagy in gastric cancer cells. w09 mainly induces cell autophagy in gastric cancer cells. blockade of autophagy with autophagy inhibitors completely inhibited w09-induced autophagy. blocking autophagy with a pan-caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-fmk, did not block w09-induced cell death. sustained MAPK1/3 phosphorylation promoted by w09 is positively correlated with the treatment time and concentration of w09 for triggering apoptosis of gastric cancer cells. this result is further supported by our ongoing work that the basal level of MAPK1/3 phosphorylation of different types of tumor cells plays a critical role in determining the activity of w09-induced autophagy and apoptosis. this result is further supported by our ongoing work that the bas w09 can induce autophagy flux in gastric cancer cells. but the mRNA level has not changed if the SQSTM1 protein level is used as an indicator of autophagy flux. this suggests that SQSTM1 might play an important role in w09-induced apoptosis in gastric cancer cells. w09, as a novel inducer, may belong to the latter group. the EGFR-mediated RAS-RAF1-MAP2K-MAPK1/3 signaling pathway plays a crucial role in cell functions, such as proliferation, differentiation, cell cycle progression or cell death. wei et al.67 recently report that erlotinib inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR. the results from Chen et al.69 also show that targeting cathepsin S with cathepsin inhibitors or RNAi induces cell autophagy. inhibition of EGFR signaling pathway with pharmacological or genetic approaches did not block w09-induced autophagy and apoptosis. this suggests that other potential mechanisms of action of w09 need to be further investigated in the future. w09 could be further developed as a novel autophagy enhancer. w09 induces autophagy by activating the EGFR-RAS-RAF1-MAP2K-MAPK1/3 signaling pathway in cancer cells. a more thorough understanding of molecular mechanisms by which w09 induces autophagic-related cell death will facilitate the development of the compound as a candidate of therapeutics to treat gastric cancer. stock solutions (20 mM) of test compounds were prepared in DMSO. stock solutions (20 mM) of test compounds were stored at 20\u00b0C. all other chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. the 1781/+46 or 1475/+46 SQSTM1 promoter construct was amplified by PCR using primers 5\u2032-ATCCTAGAGCTAGCACGCTGACTCACTGCCG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GATGACTGAAGCTCTGGCG-3\u2032. all constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 5,000 cells per well. each well was supplemented with 20 l MTT (5 mg/ml; Sigma, M5655) each well was incubated for 4 h. cell viabilities were normalized to the control. cells were harvested by trypsinization and washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 0.27 g KH2PO4, 1.42 g Na2HPO4, 8 g NaCl, 0.2 g KCl, pH 7.2) and then resuspended in binding buffer. cells were stained with 5 l of ANXA5-EGFP and 10 l of PI. transfections mCherry-LC3B-pcDNA3.1 was a gift from David Rubinsztein.
