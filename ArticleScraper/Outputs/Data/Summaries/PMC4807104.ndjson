{"summary": "triple helices are stabilised by either Hoogsteen (parallel triplex) or reverse Hoogsteen (antiparallel triplex) pair of hydrogen bonds. triplexes are also known to impair DNA polymerization and influence DNA recombination process. triplex formation process has been exploited in developing PCR based biosensor for detection of pathogens [39], high-throughput assays for measuring activity of DNA topoisomerases and other enzymes involved in DNA topology modification [40], controlled assembly of liposomes [41] and as modular probes for DNA detection [42]. a number of reviews detailing the biological significance and potential therapeutic applications of triplexes have been appearing to underscore their importance. both intramolecular [67, 71] and intermolecular [62, 72\u201374] parallel triplexes containing a limited number of G*GC & T*AT triplet pairs are observed. both intramolecular [67, 71] and intermolecular [62, 72\u201374] parallel triplexes containing a limited number of G*GC & T*AT triplet pairs. we argue that this might be responsible in imparting differential mechanistic influence in parallel vis-\u00e0-vis antiparallel triplexes causing selective preference of the former. results have yielded clear insights into the role of nonisostericity on triplex stability, stereochemical reasoning for the prevalence of antiparallel triplex. antiparallel 5\u2019 C1T2C3T4C5T6C7T8C9T10C11T12C13T14C15 8/7 7GT 7TG 14 Overlapping 100 -70.8 3\u2019 G30A29G28A27G26A25G24A23G22A21G20A19G18A17G16 5\u2019 G31T32G33T34G35T36G37T38G39T40G41T42G43T44G 5\u2019 C1C2C3C4C5C6C7C8C9C10C11 10/1 1GT 1TG 2 Overlapping 100 -50.6 3\u2019 G22G21G20G19G18A17G16G15G14G13G12 3\u2019 G33G32G31T30G29G27G26G24G23TFO 10.

MD simulation of an 11-mer antiparallel G*GC triplex with (Sequence 17) entails only a marginal loss of 3 kcal/mol in the binding free energy due to the retention of canonical reverse Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds even in the T*AT interrupt. multiple interruptions progressively destabilize the triplex. triplex lose the canonical Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds involving A15...T26 & A19...T30 pair (S4C Fig) concomitant with binding energy loss of 11 kcal/mol compared to the triplex with a single T*AT interruption (Sequence 8 vs. Sequence 9) these indicate progressive destablisation of triplex with increasing number of interruptions with a near linear correlation. shorter sequences with frequent interruptions may fail to MD simulation of this structure surprisingly shows the retention of canonical Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds in both the NIBTs. X-displacement is around -3.4 and -3.1 for the other C...G pairs (in G*GC triplex) and T...A pairs (in T*AT triplex) respectively. of the T*AT mini triplex widens to 18, while that of the G*GC mini triplex narrows to 12.0 starting from 14 respectively. backbone torsion angles lie in the preferred range (S9A Fig) the binding free energy of this triplex is -71.6 kcal/mol. ing the TG step (-t\u00b0) interface Sequence 11 in Table 1 corresponds to a triplex junction with a single pair of NIBTs intervened by the T37G38 step. the under winding effect caused by the T37G38 step is reflected in the low X-displacement for the WC pairs, C8...G23 ( -1.31 ) and T9...A22 ( -0.65 ) respectively, proximal to the triple average major groove width in both the triplexes is 21.1. WH and CH groove width lie in the range of 9 and 13 respectively. Stacking interaction is minimal at the neighborhood of triplex junction. canonical Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds are retained at the junction NIBTs akin to sequences 10 & 11 with only junction. results are on the expected lines with disengagement of canonical Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds to noncanonical Hoogsteen sequences in the T55*A30T21 and G66*G41C10 interruptions as in. the sequences 4 to 9, while they are retained in at the triplex junction interfaces G60*G35C16 & T61*A36T15 and T71*A46T5 & G72*G47C4 triplets. trend of high (37\u00b0) and low twist (12.7\u00b0) angles at the Hoogsteen G60T61 and T71G72 steps respectively concomitant with the reverse trend at the corresponding steps of WC duplex. 51.6\u00b0 is close to nearly twice the value of triple helical twist of 30\u00b0 (t\u00b0) and 8.4\u00b0 is an exceptionally low value for triple helical twist. results create disconnects of nearly one nucleotide length (5.5 to 6.3 ) in the sugar-phosphate backbone at the successive steps of the Hoogsteen strand. the results at once indicate a proclivity for the loss of Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds in both the triplets. the reverse Hoogsteen bonds of the G*GC & T*AT triplets in the antiparallel DNA triplex are largely preserved. this can be attributed to the much lower value of t\u00b0 (10\u00b0) in antiparallel. noncanonical Hoogsteen schemes emerge for both the T*AT (NC1 to NC4; Fig 3D\u20133G) and G*GC (NC5 to NC8; Fig 3H\u20133K) triplets. ion and water interact with TH (O4 & N3) and N6 & N7 of AW. canonical hydrogen bonding schemes in T*AT (brown), G*GC (green) triplets are shown along with their superposition with the canonical schemes to highlight reduction in the residual twist t\u00b0. ion (E & J) and oxygen atom of water molecule (D-G, I & K) are coloured in cyan and red respectively. this is clearly reflected in the very low binding free energy of only\u20149.4 kcal/mol for the parallel triplex (Sequence 1). the latter by and large retains all the reverse Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds in all the triplets. the parallel DNA triplex with consecutive G*GC and T*AT triplets is not expected to be stable due to the mechanistic effects of extreme nonisostericity at every base step of the strand. hydrogen bond scheme is preserved while water molecule mediates interaction between GH and WC paired bases. ion comes in between O6\u2019s of GH and O6\u2019s of GH and N7 of GW. a common feature observed in all of the above is the propensity for reducing the initial large t\u00b0 (21.6\u00b0) to lower values (as low as 1.2\u00b0 in NC3; Fig 3G) this can happen only at the expense of losing canonical Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding. such a loss in a large number of triplets would critically affect triplex stability. two t\u00b0s, viz., +t\u00b0 at the GT step (between the G*GC & T*AT triplets) andt\u00b0 at the TG step (between the T*AT & G*GC triplets) operate on the intervening T*AT triplet. this scheme may deem to be comprised of such trimer triplets constituting 14 pairs of overlapping NIBTs. this is followed by a residual twist of +t\u00b0 = +21.6\u00b0 at the GT (G28T29) step to effect over winding. the interrupting G28*G17C6 triplet loses the N1...O6 hydrogen bond of the canonical Hoogsteen scheme in favour of the noncanonical NC5 Hoogsteen scheme. the loss of the canonical Hoogsteen hydrogen bond (void part) in the interrupting G*GC triplex (N1...O6) and T*AT (N3...N7) triplets are conspicuous (blue box) a homopolymeric G*GC triplex with a G*GC interruption forms a stable parallel triple helix. a homopolymeric G*GC triplex is interrupted by the T28*A17T6 triplet, creating two overlapping and consecutive pairs of NIBTs. the interrupting T28*A17T6 loses the canonical Hoogsteen N3 (TH) average value of minor groove width is 13.26 with a reduced value of 12.1 at the interruption site. major groove widens by 2.5 to a value of 21.9. WH groove widens by 1.5 to 12.3 with the WH groove remaining nearly unchanged at 9.9. the binding free energy of the triplex with 2 and 3 G*GC interruptions (Sequence 5;40.2 kcal/mol and Sequence 6;25.9 kcal/mol; Table 1) is reduced further by 13 and 27 kcal/mol respectively compared to the triplex with a single interruption (Sequence 4) indicating progressive destabilization of triplex with increasing number of interruptions. shorter sequences with frequent interruptions may fail to form triplex. the interrupting G28*G17C6 triplet loses the N1...O6 hydrogen bond of the canonical Hoogsteen scheme. this is followed by a residual twist of +t\u00b0 = +21.6\u00b0 at the GT (G28T29) step to effect over winding. loss of the canonical Hoogsteen hydrogen bond (void part) in the interrupting G*GC triplex (N1...O6) and T*AT (N3...N7) triplets are conspicuous (blue box) a homopolymeric G*GC triplex with a G*GC interruption forms a stable parallel triple helix. a homopolymeric G*GC triplex is interrupted by the T28*A17T6 triplet, creating two overlapping and consecutive pairs of NIBTs. the interrupting T28*A17T6 loses the canonical Hoogsteen N3 (TH) average value of minor groove width is 13.26 with a reduced value of 12.1 at the interruption site. WH groove widens by 1.5 to 12.3 with the WH groove remaining nearly unchanged at 9.9 (S3B Fig). a single pair of (non-overlapping) NIBTs is harbored uniquely at a triplex junction interface. this can be differentiated by an over winding GT (+t\u00b0) or an under winding TG (-) results of MD simulations of 5 DNA triplexes differing in the number of triplex junctions and GT/TG step junction interfaces. sequence 10 represents a mini 8-mer G*GC triplex followed by a mini 7-mer T*AT triplex constituting a triplex junction harboring a lone pair. both major and minor groove expand by 2.5 and 1 to settle around 23.71 and 13.8 respectively. WH groove of the mini T*AT triplex widens from 7.3 to 9.2 with negligible change in mini G*GC triplex ( 9.0) a triplex containing a GT and a TG step junction interface prevails in the sequence 11 with a TG step junction interface (B). a conspicuous bend in the triplex structure with GT step junction interface prevails in the sequence 11 with a TG step junction interface (B). a single pair of NIBTs intervened by the T37G38 step. a low twist angle of 15\u00b0 is found at the Hoogsteen T37G38 step concomitant with a higher twist at the abutting C8T9 (38.3\u00b0) and C7C8 (35.1\u00b0) steps of the WC duplex remain at 30\u00b0. the propeller twist for the C...G pair (-4.02\u00b0) is lower than T...A pair (-13.7\u00b0) sequence 14 is designed to contain 4 sets of non-overlapping NIBTs to examine the effect of increased incidence of triplex junctions. the 15-mer triplex with 2 junctions or 2 sets of non-overlapping pairs of NIBTs shows a further decrease in binding free energy of -44.3 kcal/mol (Sequence 13) overlapping NIBTs incidence of large non-overlapping NIBTs could affect triplex stability. overlapping NIBTs incidence of large non-overlapping NIBTs in a given sequence could affect triplex stability. both major and minor groove expand by 2.5 and 1 to settle around 23.71 and 13.8 respectively. WH groove of the mini triplex widens from 7.3 to 9.2 with negligible change in mini G*GC triplex ( 9.0 ). backbone torsion angles lie in the preferred range (S9A Fig) a triplex junction with a single pair of NIBTs intervened by the TG step (-t\u00b0) interface corresponds to a triplex junction with a single pair of NIBTs intervened by the T37G38 step. this is in contrast to large X-displacement for the other C...G and T...A pairs, proximal to the triplex junction. average minor groove width is 13.12 in the mini G*GC triplex and it is 11.7 in the mini T*AT triplex. WH and CH groove width lie in the range of 9 and 13 respectively. sequence 14 is designed to contain 4 sets of non-overlapping NIBTs to examine the effect of increased incidence of triplex junctions. results reveal canonical Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds are retained at the junction NIBTs akin to sequences 10 & 11 with only junction. 2 interruptions (4 pairs of overlapping NIBTs) and 2 junctions (2 pairs of non-overlapping NIBTs) together makeup six pairs of NIBTs ( 25%) in the 25-mer triplex. results are on the expected lines with disengagement of canonical Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds to noncanonical Hoogsteen sequences. nonisostericity can be effectively and elegantly defined by residual twist and radial difference [82] which can relate directly to structural traits. surprisingly G*GC & T*AT parallel triplets exhibit strikingly large nonisostericity with the highest value of 21.6\u00b0. t\u00b0 is twice (21.6\u00b0) the value in parallel compared to 10.6\u00b0 in antiparallel triplexes. r is slightly larger in antiparallel (1.1 ) than in the parallel (0.4 ) triplexes. influence of r seems to be more in the antiparallel triplex. Isosteric base triplets endow a \u2018uniform\u2019 DNA triplex. presence of residual twist (t\u00b0), as large as 21.6\u00b0 between the parallel G*GC & T*AT triplets undermines the cannonical Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds in the DNA triplex. thus, loss of canonical Hoogsteen G...G and T...A hydrogen bonds together with interrupted stacking decrease triplex stability. a single base triplet interruption in an otherwise homopolymeric triplex results in two consecutive and overlapping pairs of NIBTs. the interrupting NIBT simultaneously bearing the brunt of nonisostericity effects of +t (+21.6\u00b0) and -t (-21.6\u00b0) this causes the canonical Hoogsteen hydrogen bond to switch to noncanonical scheme, resulting in disrupted base stacking. non-overlapping pairs of NIBTs harboring at triplex junctions experiences nonisostericity effects of either +t\u00b0 or -t\u00b0 alone. the over winding influence of +t\u00b0 at the GT step causes the triplex to bend. antiparallel triplexes with GT or TG junction interfaces retain canonical reverse Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds at the junction interface like in parallel triplexes. their binding energies of -76.4 kcal/mol (Sequence 18) and -82.3 kcal/mol (Sequence 19) are slightly more favorable by 5 kcal/mol than their parallel counterparts. the 22-mer TFO, GGGTTGTGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG NIBTs causing loss of Hoogsteen pairs in 5 out of 14 triplets. the 36-mer TFO, 5' GGGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG 'GGGGTTTTGGGG 3' with 2 triplex junctions display a similar Tm of 57\u00b0C & 58\u00b0C. this can be readily attributed to the loss of 2 (out of 14) canonical Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds at the two G*GC interruptions (4 overlapping NIBTs) in the parallel triplex. the work presented here fills this critical gap by providing quantitative description of base triplet nonisostericity as well as their mechanistic effects in influencing stability and formation of DNA triplexes. it is found that the extreme base triplet nonisostericity (residual twist) prevalent between the parallel G*GC & T*AT triplets adds an element of instability, owing to the inevitability of significant stereochemical rearrangements. t\u00b0 is twice (21.6\u00b0) the value in parallel compared to 10.6\u00b0 in antiparallel triplexes. r is slightly larger in antiparallel (1.1 ) than in the parallel (0.4 ) triplexes. influence of r seems to be more in the antiparallel triplex. base triplets endow a \u2018uniform\u2019 DNA triplex. presence of residual twist (t\u00b0), as large as 21.6\u00b0 between the parallel G*GC & T*AT triplets undermines the canonical Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds in the DNA triplex. thus, loss of canonical Hoogsteen G...G and T...A hydrogen bonds together with interrupted stacking decrease triplex stability. t interruption in an otherwise homopolymeric triplex results in two consecutive and overlapping pairs of NIBTs. the interrupting NIBT simultaneously bearing the brunt of nonisostericity effects of +t (+21.6\u00b0) and -t (-21.6\u00b0) this causes the canonical Hoogsteen hydrogen bond to switch to noncanonical scheme, resulting in disrupted base stacking. non-overlapping pairs of NIBTs harboring at triplex junctions experiences nonisostericity effects of either +t\u00b0 or -t\u00b0 alone. the over winding influence of +t\u00b0 at the GT step causes the triplex to bend (Fig 7A and 7C and S10 Fig) antiparallel triplexes with GT or TG junction interfaces retain canonical reverse Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds. their binding energies of -76.4 kcal/mol (Sequence 18) and -82.3 kcal/mol (Sequence 19) are slightly more favorable by 5 kcal/mol than their parallel counterparts (-71.6 kcal/mol and -76.4 kcal/mol) the 22-mer TFO, GGGTTGTGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG inability to form parallel triplex is obvious in view of expected loss of Hoogsteen pairs at all the interruption sites (9 out of 36 in 36-mer TFO and 8 out of 38 in 38-mer TFO) non-overlapping NIBTs in 5\u2019TTTTCmTTTTGGGGGG enables it to form a stable triplex with the oligopurine sequence flanking the SV40 origin of replication.

AMBER has also been successfully utilised to study properties like stability, folding pathway, role of ions, interaction with drugs and hydration property of various non-BDNA structures. investigations on antiparallel triplexes bought out base triplet nonisosteric effects. AMBER force field is used in the present study of parallel triple helices. base pair, base step parameters and backbone torsion angles were extracted from the output of 3DNA Ver 2.1 [125] using in-house programs. hydrogen bond distances and angles were computed using the criteria of donor...acceptor distance of 3.6 and hydrogen bond angle >120\u00b0. the gas-phase energy Egas is calculated as summation over the bond length, bond angle, dihedral angle, van der Waals and electrostatics energy contributions. GPB is calculated by summing the polar (GPB) and non-polar (Gnonpol, sol) contributions. AMBER force field is used in the present study of parallel triple helices to enable comparison with antiparallel triplexes. it has been able to reproduce with reasonable accuracy several structural and dynamical features of BDNA and non BDNA structures. initial equilibration minimization was carried out using steepest descent (2000 cycles) and conjugate-gradient (500 cycles) algorithms, with a positional restraint of 500 kcal/mol 2 on the solute atoms. further minimization was carried out with positional restraints on the solute reduced in steps of 100 kcal/mol 2. residual twist (t\u00b0) is calculated by measuring the angle between the line joining C1\u2032...C1\u2032 atoms of the Hoogsteen/Reverse Hoogsteen pair of the superimposed base triples. Radial difference corresponds to half the difference between diameters of the G*GC (14.5) & T*AT (15.3) base triplets. non-polar contribution Gnonpol\u2019sol = *SASA, wherein SASA stands for solvent accessible surface area. value of corresponds to 0.0072 kcal/mol. terminal triplet at the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 ends of the triplexes is not considered due to end-effects. average canonical Hoogsteen hydrogen bond distance of G interrupts in a (A) poly T*AT triplex (Sequence 3), (B) with a single G interruption (Sequence 4), (C) with 2 G interruptions (Sequence 5) and (D) with 3 G interruptions (Sequence 6). x (Sequence 7), (B) with a single T...A interruption (Sequence 8) and (C) with 2 T...A interruptions (Sequence 9) are marked by dashed blue rectangle. note the less fluctuation in flanking T...A triplets with increase in G interruption in C & D (denoted by orange circle) as compared to S3 Fig. X-displacement corresponding to the starting model is depicted as thick black line. x-displacement corresponding to the starting model is depicted as thick black line. click here for additional data file. a curvature near the neighbourhood of GT step: Sequence 12 (A); Sequence 13 (B): and Sequence 14 (C).
