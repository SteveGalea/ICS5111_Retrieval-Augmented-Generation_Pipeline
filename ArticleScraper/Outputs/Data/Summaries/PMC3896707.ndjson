{"summary": "BRSV infection was detected either serologically and/or virologically in 18 (86%) of 21 outbreaks and in most cases as a single viral agent. results showed that the current circulating Norwegian BRSVs belong to genetic subgroup II. one isolate from an outbreak in 1976 was also investigated. the seroprevalence is generally found to be high, with up to 100% seropositive herds in some areas. BRSV infections can appear as epidemics with outbreaks affecting many animals in several herds within the same area or as part of protracted respiratory disease problems in single herds. four antigenic subtypes have been defined based on MAbs directed against the G protein [23,24]. BRSV is divided into six different genetic subgroups. similar analysis of the N and F genes only result in five subgroups. the study was to investigate the role of BRSV and other respiratory viruses in epidemics of BRD. both serum samples and nasal swabs from 86 of the animals in these herds were collected. in 16 of these herds transtracheal aspirate (TA) or broncheoalveolar lavage (BAL) were collected from 65 of the same animals. RTqPCR detected RNA of BRSV broncheoalveolar lavage, TA tracheal aspirate. TA was instilled by instilling 100 ml HBSS via the nostrils into the bronchia through a silicone rubber tube. the tube had a diameter of 1.57 mm and an inner channel of 1.14 mm. IR\u00ae BRSV-Ab, PIV3-Ab and BCV-Ab, Svanova Biotech AB, Uppsala, Sweden, was used following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. sensitivity and specificity of the tests reported by the manufacturer was 94.6% and 100% for BRSV, 95.4% and 98.5% for BPIV3 and 100% and 84.6% for BCoV respectively. RNA was extracted from 150 l of this dissolution using QIAamp\u00ae Viral RNA (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. RNA was diluted in 60 l buffer in a BRSV specific RTqPCR (TaqVetTM, Laboratoire Service International, Lissieu, France) nucleotide sequences were purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification protocol (Qiagen) the sequences of animals from 10 herds and from a Norwegian BRSV isolate from 1976 (A1/N/76) were included. the outbreak was assessed to be in an early phase. on average five animals were included from each herd. but due to practical limitations, the number of animals ranged from two to seven. the TA or BAL samples were collected at the same day as the collection of the nasal swabs and the first serum sample. the TA or BAL samples were collected at the same day as the collection of the nasal swabs and the first serum sample. an indirect ELISA that detects antibodies to BRSV, bovine parainfluenza virus 3 (BPIV3) and bovine coronavirus (BCoV) was used following manufacturer\u2019s instructions. the difference in mean herd size of the herds with only one viral agent detected by serology was analysed with a One-way analysis of variance. the nasal swabs and 0.3 ml of the lavages were analysed. samples were stored at 4\u00b0C for 24 h and then at -80\u00b0C until analysis. RNA was extracted from 150 l of this dissolution using Qiagen. the nested PCR was run using Superscript III RT (Invitrogen) and the primer set G2.5, F2.7 and VG1, VG4 respectively were used. the conditions were 40 cycles with 95\u00b0C for 20 s, 55\u00b0C for 20 s and 72\u00b0C for 30 s using the PfuUltra II Fusion HS (Agilent Technologies) DNA polymerase. the cycles were preceded by a denaturation step at 95\u00b0C for one ELISA results are presented in Table 2. of the individuals animals 64 out of 94 (68%) were found to have an acute BRSV infection based on antibody response. BPIV3 the number was 11 out of 94 (12%) s 3/3 0/3 0/3 BRSV 27 16 3.0 mo 4/5 0/5 BRSV 51 6 2.2 mo 1/5 0/5 0/5 BRSV 55 4 1.2 yrs 7/7 0/7 0/7 BRSV 71 7 1.2 yrs 6/7 0/7 0/7 BRSV 74 3 1.7 mo 0/4 0/4 4/4 BCoV 83 11 7.3 mo 3/5 0/5 0/5 the mean size of the herds with co-infections was significantly larger (p = 0.013) than for the herds with single agent infection. in two of the herds, the serological results were ambiguous. in herd #2, paired serum samples were lacking. analysis Nucleotide sequences from the BRSV G protein gene were successfully obtained from 10 herds and from the isolate from 1976. from the additional six herds that were positive for BRSV by RTqPCR, the virus load was below the threshold for achievable sequencing. Phylogeny shows the relationship between 31 selected nucleotide sequences based on a 472 nt part from nucleotide number 178 to 649 of the G gene of BRSV. the sequences from this study originated from 10 different farms with outbreaks of respiratory disease in Norway between 2009 and 2011. the gene nucleotide sequences obtained from nasal swabs and BAL samples from five of the same individuals in herd #17 were identical, apart from one nucleotide difference found in one sequence from a nasal swab of one animal. this resulted in a substitution from Threonine to Isoleucine. serological results from animals in herds with outbreak of respiratory disease Herd size Herd no. pos/sampled BCoV infection No. pos/sampled Serological detection 13 20 3.9 yrs 5/5 0/5 0/5 BRSV 20 1 2.3 yrs 1/2 0/2 0/2 BRSV 24 21 3.5 yrs 3/3 0/3 0/3 BRSV 27 3.0 mo 4/5 0/5 BRSV 51 6 the ratio of animals with acute antibody response against BRSV, BPIV3 and/or BCoV out of investigated animals is shown. animals were defined as positive for infection if they seroconverted or if the antibody titre increased 70%. the mean age is at first sampling. een herds were positive in TA or BAL and nasal swabs by RTqPCR. a total of 51 animals from 16 herds were RTqPCR positive for BRSV. a total of 51 animals from 16 herds were RTqPCR positive for BRSV. sequences obtained from the broncheoalveolar lavage and nasal swab of the same animal belonged to subgroup II. the total nucleotide difference of the gene fragment was only between 0.15% and 0.31%. the isolate from 1976 formed a separate branch (Figure 1). the deduced amino acids from the Norwegian sequences separated in two distinct strains called A and B. the occurrence of the A and B strains overlapped both temporarily and geographically. the occurrence of the A and B strains overlapped both temporarily and geographically. the number of BRSV positive animals was higher than for BPIV3 and BCoV. this indicates that the infection dynamics may be more complex in larger herds. only a minor part of the BRSV genome was sequenced, but it is the part where most variation has been found. all the BRSV G protein sequences obtained in this study belonged to genetic subgroup II. the deduced amino acid sequences retrieved in our study could be divided into two clades where six nucleotide substitutions systematically gave a difference of five amino acids. the current Norwegian strains of BRSV belong to the genetic subgroup II along with other North European isolates. the current strains of BRSV belong to the genetic subgroup II along with other North European isolates, supporting the theory of geographical and temporal clustering of BRSV.
