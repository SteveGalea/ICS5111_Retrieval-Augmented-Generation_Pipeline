{"summary": "communityacquired pneumonia remains one of the major causes of morbidity in children living in developed countries. evaluating the relative importance of each potential pathogen may also contribute to improving our understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease. a considerable number of CAP cases were not etiologically identified. the study was carried out in the department of maternal and pediatric sciences of the university of Milan between November 1 and April 30 of four consecutive winter and early spring seasons. the children with presumed nosocomial CAP were also excluded. asal nylon flocked swab and stored in a tube of UTMRT (Cat. No. 360c; Copan Italia, Brescia, Italy) Upon enrollment, detailed information regarding demographic data, clinical history, and clinical characteristics of the disease was collected together with a blood sample for the evaluation of laboratory variables. the drug treatment was chosen by the pediatrician in charge on the basis of the guidelines of the Italian Society of Pediatrics. the plate was then analyzed using a bioPlex 200 System. an MFI above the threshold level determined by the manufacturer indicated a positive result for that target. the RVP Fast assay simultaneously detects influenza A virus (subtypes H1 or H3). the continuous variables are given as mean values standard deviation (SD) and were analyzed using a twosided, nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum test. the categorical variables are given as absolute numbers and percentages. children with presumed nosocomial CAP were excluded. children with presumed nosocomial CAP appeared 48 hours after admission. children with presumed nosocomial CAP were excluded. 13 children with mild disease were sent home with detailed therapeutic instructions and recommendation to return to the hospital in the case of persistent fever or worsening respiratory symptoms and signs. the clinical data collected during hospitalization were recorded daily, and all of the children were reevaluated 15 2 days later. an MFI above the threshold level determined by the manufacturer indicated a positive result for that target. the RVP Fast assay simultaneously detects influenza A virus (subtypes H1 or H3), influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)A and B, parainflunzavirus1, 2, 3, and 4, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), coronaviruses 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1, the continuous variables are given as mean values standard deviation (SD) and were analyzed using a twosided, nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum test. the categorical variables are given as absolute numbers and percentages. 167 children (all negative for respiratory viruses) had positive blood cultures (six for Streptococcus pneumoniae, two for Staphylococcus aureus, and one for nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae) the most frequently detected virus was RSV, which was found in 188 children (317%), followed by rhinovirus (n = 144, 243%), bocavirus (n = 60, 101%), influenza viruses (n = 57, 96%: six seasonal A/ (%) Total no.
