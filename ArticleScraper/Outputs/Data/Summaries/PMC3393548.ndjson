{"summary": "feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) shares similarities with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the most important human pathogen belonging to this viral genus. in nondomestic felids, FIV is minimally pathogenic (6, 8, 27, 62, 63), as is simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) SIVagm and other naturally occurring SIVs in their natural hosts. host restriction factors are host cellular proteins constitutively expressed or induced by interferon (IFN) in response to viral infection. the properties that characterize these proteins have contributed to their discovery are their species and virus specificities (28, 52, 53) -1 Vpu protein antagonizes tetherin by causing its degradation and sequestration into a perinuclear compartment away from virus assembly sites. it was recently reported that the feline genome carries a gene with significant identity to the known primate, rodent, and canine tetherin sequences. both studies showed that feline tetherin has an evident effect on the release of viral particles, but the viruses tested were different. feline tetherin has an N-terminal region shorter than that of the human tetherin orthologue. the main viral factor counteracts the tetherin function in the FIV envelope glycoprotein. the topology of cat BST2 (cBST2) was predicted by using the following programs. the human tetherin-encoding region was cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Milan, Italy) and then into the pcDNA3.1 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen) the human tetherin-encoding region was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) performed on total RNA extracted from HeLa cells. derivative of plasmid p00 characterized by 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 long terminal repeats (LTRs) replaced by the cytomegalovirus early promoter (Pro) and bovine growth hormone poly(A), respectively (46). sequences encoding the viral envelope or OrfA were obtained from plasmid pLTR by enzymatic restrictions and inserted into pBluescript KS II. 293T cells were transfected with constructs expressing either the wild-type FIV genome (LTR-WT) or its derivatives. characterized by a frameshift in the envelope-encoding sequence (CMV-Envfs), a stop codon at the amino acid 2 position of the OrfA sequence (CMV-OrfAStop), or a combination of both these changes (CMV-Envfs) alone. cell lysates and purified virus particles were analyzed 24 h after IFN- treatment by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting using the anti-FIV Gag monoclonal antibody. values obtained for LTR-WT and LTR-Envfs in the absence of IFN- treatment were set as 100%. pSVC21 construct expressing the HIV-1 HXBc2 molecular clone (16) was provided by Joseph Sodroski (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) all plasmid DNA expression constructs were prepared by using a QIAFilter kit. two different constructs, cBST2504 and cBST2561, were generated by using forward primers A and B. the reverse primer located in the region corresponding to the stop codon. total RNA was extracted from CrFK cells by employing the RNeasy minikit. a version of the protein lacking the putative GPI anchor was also generated by RT-PCR using total RNA from CrFK cells. a construct encoding a truncated form of cBST2 enriched with a 3\u2032 Flag tag was thus obtained (cBST2GPI) 293T cells (3.5 105 cells) were seeded into 6-well plates. transfected cells were either incubated in presence of 1,000 U/ml of human recombinant alpha interferon A/D (IFN-A/D) or mock incubated. flag epitope sequence, 0.5 mM (each) deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP), 40 U of RNase inhibitor, and 125 U of Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MuLV) reverse transcriptase. RNA samples were incubated in the reaction mixture at 25\u00b0C for 10 min, at 42\u00b0C for 50 min, and then at 95\u00b0C for 5 min. the selected target sequence was mapped to plasmid pTA-cBST2 was quantified by using a fluorimetric Picogreen method. a serial dilution was used as a reference for cBST2 quantification. proteins were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. a peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (GE Healthcare, Milan, Italy) was developed with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (GE Healthcare) when necessary, the pixel intensities of the visualized bands were determined by using Image J software (W. S. Rasband, NIH, Bethesda, MD. the cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer. supernatants were clarified by low-speed centrifugation and passaged through 0.45-m-pore-size filters. viral proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. nal antibody (Sigma) and goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G antibody (DBA, Milan, Italy) were diluted with bovine serum albumin (1% [wt/vol] in PBS. the cells were lysed in RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitors. different homologous tetherins and promoter region sequences were aligned by using the CLUSTALW2 algorithm. the human BST2 (hBST2) construct was generated by cloning the human tetherin-encoding region first into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Milan, Italy) and then into the pcDNA3.1 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen) the human tetherin-encoding region was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) performed on total RNA extracted from HeLa cells by means of forward primer 5\u2032-GCCACC plasmid pLTR is a derivative of plasmid p00, characterized by 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 long terminal repeats (LTRs) replaced by the cytomegalovirus early promoter (Pro) and bovine growth hormone poly(A) respectively (46) by using these constructs as a starting point, a series of mutants was generated at the OrfA- and envelope-encoding regions. p34TF10 Petaluma strain is either the wild type (WT) or under the control of either the FIV 5\u2032 LTR or the CMV promoter (Pro) the polyadenylation signals are provided by either the 3\u2032 end of the FIV 3\u2032 LTR or that of the bovine growth hormone transcript. 293T cells were transfected with constructs expressing either the wild-type FIV genome (CMV-WT) or its derivatives. cell lysates and purified virus particles were analyzed 24 h after IFN- treatment by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting using the anti-FIV Gag monoclonal antibody. values obtained for LTR-WT and LTR-Envfs in the absence of IFN- treatment were set as 100%. plasmid encoding the envelope of the in vivo-readapted strain Petaluma (FIV-Petaluma) (pEE14-Env) was described elsewhere previously (47) the pSVC21 construct expressing the HIV-1 HXBc2 molecular clone was provided by Joseph Sodroski (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) a forward primer located 57 nucleotides upstream of the putative initiation start site. the reverse primer located in the region corresponding to the stop codon. the amplified fragments were inserted into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) PCR-based strategy with a Flag epitope inserted between the predicted extracellular coiled-coil domain of the protein and the predicted GPI anchor signal. a version of the protein lacking the putative GPI anchor was also generated by RT-PCR using total RNA from CrFK cells. 293T cells (3.5 105 cells) were seeded into 6-well plates and transfected with either Pro-eGFP or Pro-cBST2504. transfected cells were either incubated in the presence of 1,000 U/ml of human recombinant alpha interferon A/D (IFN-A/D) RNA samples were incubated at 25\u00b0C for 10 min, at 42\u00b0C for 50 min, and then at 95\u00b0C for 5 min. the selected target sequence was mapped to cBST2 exon 1. plasmid pTA-cBST2 was quantified by using a fluorimetric Picogreen method. a serial dilution was used as a reference for cBST2 quantification. proteins were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) gel electrophoresis. 1.2 106 293T cells were transfected with the appropriate proviral construct. in all cases, the total amount of transfected DNA was brought to 3.25 g (293T cells) by the addition of the pcDNA3.1 empty vector. the cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer. they were clarified by low-speed centrifugation and passaged through 0.45-m-pore-size filters. viral proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting. samples were incubated with anti-flag primary mouse monoclonal antibody (Sigma) and with a secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G antibody (DBA, Milan, Italy) the cells were lysed in RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitors. the immunocomplexes were harvested with protein G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) cBST2 amino acid sequence identified is characterized by 57 in-frame nucleotides, starting with a GAG codon, which can potentially encode 19 amino acids. cBST2 sequence identified is characterized by 57 in-frame nucleotides, starting with a GAG codon, which can encode 19 amino acids. cBST2561 was obtained by adopting a 5\u2032 primer that anneals to the c430601298.contig 1 sequence from nucleotide 57 to nucleotide 37, where nucleotide +1 is represented by the A of the first annotated ATG (forward primer A) cBST2504 contains the sequence starting from the first cBST2-encoding region identified (forward primer B) cBST2* was obtained from cBST2561 by the introduction of an ATG in the place of the GAG (from positions 57 to 55) a construct characterized by the ATG replaced by a GCG (from positions +1 to +3) was designed as a control (cBST2ATG-GCG) putative N-glycosylation sites in the extracellular coiled-coil domain are indicated by black squares. cysteines potentially involved in disulfide bounds are marked by stars. the black circles indicate a second methionine mapping at the level of the cytoplasmic tail. the feline genomic region starting 2,192 nucleotides upstream of the cBST2 ATG shows promoter activity and is sensitive to IFN- treatment. 293T cells were transfected with either pro-eGFP, CMV-eGFP or pEGFP1 (eGFP) constructs. canonical cis elements (CCAAT box, GC box, TATA box, and SP-1), at least two interferon-responsive elements (IRF-1/2) as well as interferon-activated transcription factor binding sites (STAT3 and ISFG3) were identified. a construct (Pro-cBST2504) was thus generated in which the cBST2-encoding sequence is under the transcriptional control of the feline genomic region spanning from nucleotide 2192 to 293T cells were transfected with either cBST2*, cBST2504 or human BST2 (hBST2) as a control. twenty-four hours later, the cells were lysed, and the proteins were run in SDS-polyacrylamide gels. cBST2 dimerizes and is expressed on the cell surface, independently of the N-terminal cytoplasmic tail length. 293T cells were transfected with the tetherin constructs described above. arrows point to membrane-localized tetherin. control represents cells transfected with the pcDNA3.1 empty vector. the deletion of the GPI anchor abrogated the ability of feline tetherin to block HIV-1 release regardless of the presence of Vpu. 293T cells were transfected with either HIV-1 Vpu- or HIV-1 Vpu+-expressing plasmids alone. at 24 h posttransfection, the cells were lysed, and the viral particles were spun down by ultracentrifugation. lentiviruses have evolved the ability to use three proteins to antagonize tetherin, i.e., HIV-1 Vpu, Nef, and envelope proteins from some simian immunodeficiency viruses. cBST2504 effectively blocked FIV budding, even when 1,000 ng of the expression plasmid was transfected. cBST2504 did not efficiently inhibit viral particle release. 293T cells were transfected with the construct expressing the wild-type FIV genome (CMV-WT) alone or along with increasing amounts of the cBST2504 plasmid (250, 500, 750, and 1,000 ng) (A) or 1,500 ng of the cBST2* or hBST2 construct (B) at 24 h posttransfection, the cells were lysed, and the viral particles were spun down by ultracentrifugation a frameshift mutation in the envelope-encoding sequence in 293T cells was not observed. the effect of cBST2504 on CMV-Envfs particle release was significantly less evident when cBST2* was adopted. the effect was significantly less evident when cBST2* was adopted. o-readapted FIV-Petaluma (Env) was unable to rescue CMV-Envfs particle release even when human tetherin was expressed at a very low level (50 and 30 ng) this result indicates that the counteracting activity of the viral glycoprotein is specific to feline tetherin. 293T cells were transfected with constructs expressing the entire viral genome (CMV-WT) 293T cells were transfected with either the CMV-WT or CMV-Envfs constructs alone () or along with (+) either 4 g of the cBST2504 (D) or 500 ng of the hBST2 plasmid (E) twenty-four hours later, cells were lysed, and samples were immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody to Flag. cBST2 potently inhibits wild-type HIV 293T cells were transfected with constructs expressing the HIV-1 Vpu+, HIV-2 ROD10, or SIVmac239 proviral DNA alone. cBST2 appears to have a topology comparable to those of other mammalian and nonmammalian tetherins. two amino acid sequences were aligned, starting from the first available methionine, with those of tetherins from dog (GenBank accession no. XP_865603.1), human (GenBank accession no. XP_865603.1), chimpanzee (GenBank accession no. NP_004326.1), rat (GenBank accession no. NP_937767), taurus (GenBank accession no. XP_ cBST2 was found to be capable of blocking the production of cat infectious RD114 endogenous retrovirus, but its effect on FIV and other lentiviruses was not analyzed. three different constructs (cBST2504, cBST2561, and cBST2*) were thus generated by appropriate amplification from total RNA extracted from CrFK cells. a construct characterized by the ATG replaced by a GCG (from positions +1 to +3) was designed as a control (cBST2ATG-GCG) in all cases, a flag tag was introduced at the 3\u2032 end before the GPI modification signal. cBST2GPI construct represents cBST2 lacking the putative GPI anchor signal. the 57 nucleotide region upstream of the first annotated ATG does not contain noncanonical initiation start sites. 293T cells were transfected with either pro-eGFP, CMV-eGFP, or pEGFP1 (eGFP) constructs. they were either treated with IFN- (+) or mock incubated. cBST2 expression can be responsive to alpha interferon (IFN-) treatment. SW prediction program identified the transcription start site 2 nucleotides downstream of the GAG triplet and 55 nucleotides upstream of the ATG. a construct (Pro-cBST2504) was thus generated in which the cBST2-encoding sequence is under the transcriptional control of the feline genomic region spanning from nucleotide 2192 to the annotated ATG. 293T cells were transfected with the construct, either treated with IFN- or left un 293T cells were transfected with either cBST2*, cBST2504 or human BST2 (hBST2) as a control. twenty-four hours later, the cells were lysed, and the proteins were run in SDS-polyacrylamide gels both in the presence and in the absence of -mercaptoethanol (ME) it was found that both feline proteins were able to dimerize, a feature which has been demonstrated to play a role human 293T cells were cotransfected with 1.25 g of either the HIV-1 vpu-minus (Vpu) strain or the isogenic Vpu-encoding HIV strain (HIV-1 Vpu+) cBST2504- or cBST2*-encoding construct was sufficient to cause roughly 50% and 40% reductions in HIV-1 Vpu+ and Vpu strain budding. deletion of the GPI anchor abrogated the ability of feline tetherin to block HIV-1 release regardless of the presence of Vpu. 293T cells were transfected with either HIV-1 Vpu- or HIV-1 Vpu+-expressing plasmids alone. at 24 h posttransfection, the cells were lysed, and the viral particles (VPs) were spun down by ultracentrifugation. cBST2 has been shown to be targeted and functionally inactivated by the evolution of antagonistic accessory proteins (23, 24, 29, 31, 35, 73) primate lentiviruses have indeed evolved the ability to use three proteins to antagonize tetherin, i.e., HIV-1 Vpu, Nef, and envelope proteins from some simian immunodeficiency viruses as well as the HIV-2 envelope protein. cBST2504 plasmid (250, 500, 750, and 1,000 ng) (A) or 1,500 ng of the cBST2* or hBST2 construct (B) at 24 h posttransfection, the cells were lysed, and the viral particles were spun down by ultracentrifugation. the numbers below each panel represent the percentage values of particle release. CrFK cells were cotransfected with either the LTR-WT or LTR-Envfs constructs and incubated with IFN- or mock incubated. twenty-four hours later, VLPs were purified from the cell supernatants. a potent inhibition of the LTR-Envfs particle release was observed. 293T cells were transfected with a construct expressing the entire viral genome (CMV-WT) the viral glycoprotein represents the viral factor counteracting cBST2 activity. tetherin interacts with the FIV-Petaluma envelope glycoprotein. cell lysates were loaded and assayed by Western blotting. cBST2 potently inhibits wild-type HIV-2 ROD10 and SIVmac239. it has been demonstrated that host restriction factors, such as tetherin, can impede viral cross-species transmission. proviral DNA alone or along with 1,500 ng of cBST2504 (+) cell lysates (Cells) and purified viral particles (VPs) were analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-capsid HIV-1/HIV-2/SIV polyclonal antibody. the role of three restriction proteins, APOBEC3G, TRIM5, and, more recently, tetherin/BST2, has been extensively investigated. a protein whose N-terminal region is shorter than those of most homologues described previously. the effect of this feline tetherin on FIV and other lentiviruses was not investigated. dietrich and collaborators expressed a longer form of feline tetherin. they analyzed its effect on HIV and FIV particle release. feline genomic sequence from nucleotide 2192 to the first ATG displays promoter activity and is inducible by IFN treatment. gene expression was very low compared to that achieved by overexpression of the protein under the transcriptional control of the CMV promoter. cBST2 does not represent the first case of a protein with a short N-terminal region lacking putative trafficking motifs. cBST2 does not represent the first case of a protein with a short N-terminal region lacking putative trafficking motifs. oBST2A displays a cytoplasmic tail 11 amino acids shorter than the N-terminal region of human tetherin. neither cBST2504 nor cBST2* significantly blocks the budding of wild-type FIV particles. cBST2504 and cBST2* potently inhibited HIV-2 ROD10 and SIVmac239 particle release. cBST2504 and cBST2* display antiviral activities. dietrich et al. performed an assay in which VSV-G/FIV pseudotypes were prepared in the presence or absence of both feline tetherin and a replication-defective molecular clone of FIV (CMVG8Mpol4) and then titrated on 293T cells. cBST2ATG-GCG was unable to block the release of LTR/CMV-Envfs. the viral glycoprotein was unable to immunoprecipitate human tetherin. this strongly suggests its effect is specific for the feline antiviral factor. further studies are required to identify molecular mechanisms underlying the envelope protein's ability to counteract tetherin."}
