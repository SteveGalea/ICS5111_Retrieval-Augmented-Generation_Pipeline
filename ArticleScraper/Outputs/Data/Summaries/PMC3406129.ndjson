{"summary": "the threat of bioterrorist attacks (e.g., Bacillus anthracis) and recent outbreaks of airborne pathogenic infections (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome) have raised the level of public interest in biological aerosols and protection methods that prevent their spread (7, 20, and http://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/update.htm) infectivity of the captured viruses persists, which makes the contaminated FFR a fomite. transient, high rates of airflow (e.g., coughing and sneezing) aggravate the probability of reaerosolization. reaerosolization of viruses captured on the FFR is a possibility. microwave irradiation, UV irradiation, and biocidal surfaces have been shown to decontaminate viral aerosols collected on filters. these methods do not remove accumulated particles; however, loading is typically light enough that the decontaminated filter's performance is not affected. a freeze-dried MS2 culture was suspended in DI water at a titer of approximately 1011 to 1012 PFU/ml. the virus stock was successively diluted to 108 to 109 PFU/ml with 1 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) tryptone soy broth (TSB) and culture medium 271 were prepared by following the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) procedure for MS2 assay. freeze-dried E. coli cells were suspended in 1 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), inoculated into a solidified agar plate (1.5% agar) with a sterilized loop, and incubated at 37\u00b0C overnight. a 2.4-MHz ultrasonic nebulizer was used to generate droplets containing viruses with a flow rate of 2 liters/min. a 2.4-MHz ultrasonic nebulizer was used to generate droplets containing viruses with a flow rate of 2 liters/min. each filter was then cut into four equal quadrants for UV exposure. collison nebulizer (CN25; BGI Inc., Waltham, MA) was used to generate the aerosol containing viruses with a flow rate of 6 liters/min. the suspension was prepared by dispersing 2 ml of viral stock suspension in 50 ml of nebulizer medium. the flow was split into three streams toward the filters. each quadrant was placed in a 50-ml conical tube containing sterilized DI water and agitated with a wrist action shaker. the extracted MS2 was assayed with the single-layer method. IE was determined by comparing the count from the irradiated coupon to that from the paired control. a single-layer bioassay with a host of Escherichia coli (ATCC 15597) was used to enumerate the infectious viruses (8). freeze-dried E. coli cells were suspended in 1 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), inoculated into a solidified agar plate (1.5% agar) with a sterilized loop. saliva is a very dilute fluid composed of more than 98% water, electrolytes, mucus, and enzyme. a viscous glycoprotein comprising approximately 75% carbohydrate and 25% amino acids linked via glycosidic bonds between N-acetylgalactosamine and serine or threonine residues. droplet loading system (A) and aerosol loading system (B) was conducted at room temperature (20 3\u00b0C) and HRH. a collison nebulizer (CN25; BGI Inc., Waltham, MA) was used to generate the aerosol containing viruses with a flow rate of 6 liters/min. each quadrant was placed in a 50-ml conical tube containing sterilized DI water and agitated with a wrist action shaker. the extracted MS2 was assayed with the single-layer method. IE was determined by comparing the count from the irradiated coupon to that from the paired control. 5.2, 3.0, and 2.7 log IEs were measured in DI water, AS, and BE respectively. 4.8, 2.7, and 2.5 log IEs were measured in DI water, AS, and BE respectively, for droplet transmission mode. the IEs in Fig. 2 depend on the following three parameters: UV irradiation time. nebulizer was around 9 to 10 m (33), whereas aerosols from the Collison nebulizer measured 1 to 2 m (16) the evaporation time for a 1-m droplet at HRH and 20\u00b0C, 0.63 to 0.7 s, is much longer than the residence time. however, the larger droplets retain much of their water at contact. solids in DI water, BE, and AS have a much lower solid content. this mode of protection is supported by SEM images of filters contaminated with MS2 viruses aerosolized in different media. images of MS2 generated in DI water show aggregates in the range of 100 nm to 1 m on the substrate. grape-shaped superaggregates were observed in the absence of mucin. multivalent cations of the soluble salts (Mg2+ and Ca2+) can interact with negatively charged features on the surface of MS2 to promote a high degree of virus aggregation (24) both encasement by water-insoluble mucin and aggregation by water-soluble salts contribute protection. the organic solids in BE are stronger absorbers at 254 nm and thus provide more effective protection from UV radiation. log IEs measured after aerosol loading for 30 min followed by UV exposure for 60 min at different RHs. 0.0197* RH during aerosol loading 0.0001* Spray RH during aerosol loading 0.0001* RH during UV inactivation 0.0001* RH during UV inactivation 0.4188 RH during UV inactivation 0.4188 RH during aerosol loading 0.6278 Two-way ANOVA for artificial saliva RH during aerosol loading 0.4569 RH during UV inactivation 0.0204* RH during aerosol loading 0.9983 a An asterisk indicates a significant parameter the contributions of both RH regimens are less than 6%. the contribution of RH during inactivation is 1.9 times that of RH during virus loading, suggesting some effect of water on protection by the solid content. IEs fell to the range of 2.7 to 3.2 logs under all nine sets of RH conditions. the IE of UV irradiation as a function of time can be defined as IE = N o N s = ( A e K C t ) 1 (5) where A is the fraction of the total initial population subject to fast decay, no is the concentration of airborne virus before UV exposures, no is the concentration of airborne virus before UV exposures, no is the UV intensity factor (W/m2), t is time (s), and K is the virus susceptibility factor ( log IEs were 4.32, 2.32, and 1.98 after 60-min irradiation in DI water, AS, and BE respectively. log IEs were 4.32, 2.32, and 1.98 after 60-min irradiation in DI water. log IEs were achieved in 271 B medium applying 4.32 J/cm2 under MRH during UV exposure. at same power density and RH condition in this study, 5.2, 3.0, and 2.7 log IEs were measured in DI water, AS, and BE. IE for aerosols was higher than for droplets. water in the droplets absorbs UV (13, 18) and shielding of viruses near the center of the aggregate likely also contributes to this trend. the partial pressure in kPa at a given temperature in K was calculated according to p d = exp. IEs in AS and in BE were much lower than in DI water for both aerosol and droplet transmissions. the likely reason for this difference is a protective effect caused by solids in both AS and BE. as aerosolized virions and aggregates load onto the filter, it is possible for them to form a wide size range of superaggregates. soluble salts (Mg2+ and Ca2+) can interact with negatively charged features on the surface of MS2 to promote a high degree of virus aggregation. in 0.3% mucin-free AS were higher than those in 0.3% mucin medium (salt-free AS), indicating better protection by water-insoluble mucin and aggregation by water-soluble salts. the encasement in BE provided better protection than in AS, even though the volume fraction of solids in BE is only half of that in AS. statistical factor ANOVAa Factor P value Three-factor ANOVA for three media Spray medium 0.0001* RH during UV inactivation 0.0197* RH during aerosol loading 0.0001* Spray RH during aerosol loading 0.0001* Two-way ANOVA for artificial saliva RH during aerosol loading 0.0118*. this may be attributed to a combination of intrinsic susceptibility of MS2 and UV exposure susceptibility of MS2. the second susceptibility was the more important parameter IEs in BE were not significantly influenced by RH during virus loading, during UV irradiation for 60 min, or by their interaction. the contribution of both RH regimens is less than 6%, although the contribution of RH during inactivation is 1.9 times that of RH during virus loading, suggesting some effect of water on protection by the solid content. the IE of UV irradiation as a function of time can be defined as IE = N o N s = ( A e K C t ) 1 (5) where A is the fraction of the total initial population subject to fast decay, Ns is the concentration of airborne virus surviving after UV exposures, C is the UV intensity factor (W/m2), t is time (s), and K is the virus susceptibility factor (m2/J). dsDNA is a stronger UV absorber than DNA (13, 18) but RNA is a stronger UV absorber than DNA (13, 18). dsDNA is a ds, double stranded; ss, single stranded."}
