{"summary": "NIAID aims to characterize the pathogen and host cell proteome by identifying proteins associated with the biology of microbes, mechanisms of microbial pathogenesis and host responses to infection. the program includes seven Proteomics Research Centers (PRCs) conducting state-of-the-art high-throughput research on pathogens of concern in biodefense and emerging infectious diseases. ii) how to coordinate with the seven PRCs with various pathogens, technologies, processes, and data types; and (iii) how to provide seamless integration of three institutions that make up the Resource Center. the potential user community is quite broad, from technology or informatics experts who may want to reanalyze the data. a protein-centric approach for systems integration of such a large and heterogeneous set of data from the NIAID Biodefense Proteomics program. we describe in detail a protein-centric approach for systems integration of such a large and heterogeneous set of data from the NIAID Biodefense Proteomics program. the Proteomics Data Center contains complete experimental data and protocols for each PRC data set in relational databases but is not integrated in the protein-centric manner. a protein-centric approach works well as proteins occupy a middle ground molecularly between gene and transcript information. the MPD data is stored in an Oracle database along with iProClass data. for data exchange, an XML file and schema for the current MPD are available for download at: ftp://141.161.76.88. some mapping problems needed to be addressed either by automated rules, direct sequence comparisons or manual analysis and annotation. one-to-many mappings: common problem, especially when eukaryotic host proteins derived from alternate splicing or viral polyproteins are involved. several data sets contained information on annotated but not translated pseudogenes. in the case of Vibrio cholera, 21 of 48 pseudogenes cloned and sequenced by the Harvard Institute of Proteomics did not contain the annotated point mutation or frame shift. our target user was a biomedical scientist not expert in the technology used to produce the data or in bioinformatics. we included in the MPD only \u201cvalidated\u201d results that were determined to be significant using their methods. to do otherwise would confuse users not familiar with the technology. over 100 text fields and unique identifiers from the MPD database are indexed using the PIR text indexing system [20]. entry indexing and retrieval is supported by Oracle. the MPD database contains over 100 fields derived from iProClass and Proteomics Research Center's data. 75 of these fields are available for individual searches and can be combined with Boolean operators. 62 fields can be customized. the Proteomics Catalog houses web pages with information on the PRCs, the NIAID Proteomics Program and project related publications. the Proteomics Data Center contains complete experimental data and protocols for each PRC data set in relational databases. the key design principal in the Resource Center is protein-centric data integration. the MPD data is stored in an Oracle database along with iProClass data. an XML file and schema for the current MPD are available for download at: ftp://141.161.76.88/pub/proteomics_ftp/rc/MD_data/iproclass_mpd.xml. the first step was to map all experimental results to a common representation of a protein. this was achieved by mapping all protein and gene IDs and names to iProClass proteins. some mapping problems needed to be addressed either by automated rules, direct sequence comparisons or manual analysis and annotation. several data sets contained information on annotated but not translated pseudogenes. in the case of Vibrio cholera, 21 of 48 pseudogenes cloned and sequenced by the Harvard Institute of Proteomics did not contain the annotated point mutation or frame shift. perability Working Group developed 3 goals for data mining. all project data and other deliverables should be available via browsing. the data and information provided by the resource should be sufficient to allow a skilled researcher to download and reanalyze the data for additional information. a simple keyword search was implemented on every page of the resource's website. this searches all fields in the MPD database. the default option searches all text from the PubMed abstract for all project publications, an abstract of each technology and all text in SOPs. the MPD database contains over 100 fields derived from iProClass and Proteomics Research Center's data. 75 of these fields are available for individual searches and can be combined with Boolean operators. results that fell below the significance threshold used by the research center were made available via download of data sets at the FTP site. to facilitate and simplify searches across laboratories and data types, we omitted most data type or analysis specific numerical values and statistics from the general MPD search and display. a simple keyword search was implemented on every page of the resource's website. this searches all fields in the MPD. the default option searches all text from the PubMed abstract for all project publications and an abstract of each technology. the protein-centric search results are presented in a customizable tabular format where users can add or delete columns. the tabular display has two modes: 1) a default mode which displays fields common to all the supported data types and 2) a data type specific mode which restricts the results to a particular data type. additional filters for Proteomic Research Center and Organism are available as pull down menus. the default protein-centric search returns results for all project deliverables, data, reagents, protocols, technologies and publications. a single keyword search \u201cbacillus anthracis\u201d finds 10,988 pathogen and host proteins with Mass spec, microarray or protein interaction data and also 13,251 reagents in the Master Reagent Directory. matched fields column allows users to refine queries and construct simple Boolean searches. 222 proteins meet these criteria, mostly from mass spectrometry studies by PNNL and the University of Michigan. a total of 9 identifiers from 4 different databases were reported in the research results that represent either the gene or protein sequence for this single mouse protein. a total of 9 identifiers from 4 different databases (Unigene, RefSeq, IPI, nr) were reported in the research results. log K1033_HUMAN was detected in HeLa cells infected with vaccinia and monkypox virus. if we do a batch retrieval using Uniref90 IDs from all 16 original mouse proteins, we find 12 human homologs were also detected in studies of orthopox infection. the identification of a hypothetical protein with differential gene and protein expressions in two host systems (mouse macrophage and HeLa cells) infected by different bacterial (Baci a protein interaction network was determined using a yeast-two hybrid assay. a protein interaction network was obtained from viral preparations isolated from infected human HeLa cells. the work from PNNL contained quantitative information in the form of spectral counts. a single human protein interacts with three viral proteins. the host protein Keratin, type II cytoskeletal 4 (P19013) interacts with three viral proteins. the 14 kDa fusion protein A27L is the most abundant protein seen in this data set. cytoskeletal 4 has tissue specificity in the suprabasal layer of the stratified epithelium of the esophagus, exocervix, vagina, mouth and lingual mucosa. cytoskeletal 4 has tissue specificity in the suprabasal layer of the stratified epithelium of the esophagus, exocervix, vagina, mouth and lingual mucosa, and in cells and cell clusters in the mucosa and an initial total of 327 proteins unique to the Bacillus anthracis proteome were identified using the CUPID and UniProtKB version 13.0. the species most closely related to the selected organism is based on the best BLAST hits of its entire proteome [54] the 21 proteins were screened for significant regions of similarity at the DNA level (either pseudogenes or unannotated genes) using tBLASTn against the NCBI nr database. this additional analysis resulted in a total of 10 Bacillus anthracis specific proteins proposed as high-quality targets for development of diagnostic probes. six of the ten targets have data from the University of Michigan PRC showing that they were differentially expressed in published microarray experiments. a similar approach was taken for Salmonella species using CUPID and public PRC data. several candidate diagnostic proteins are currently being validated in the laboratory. 30% of the proteins are uncharacterized in that they are called either \u201cUncharacterized\u201d or \u201cHypothetical\u201d and have no other functional annotations or functional domains. number represents the total number of proteins that meet the listed criteria, for example, have one or more GO term or pathway or link associated with the protein. a single keyword search \u201cbacillus anthracis\u201d finds 10,988 pathogen and host proteins with Mass spec, microarray or protein interaction data and also 13,251 reagents in the Master Reagent Directory. the matched fields column allows users to refine their queries and construct simple Boolean searches. 222 proteins meet these criteria, mostly from mass spectrometry studies by PNNL and the University of Michigan. a total of 9 identifiers from 4 different databases were reported in the research results that represent either the gene or protein sequence for this single mouse protein. five of the 16 proteins found in the query also have mass spec data from Caprion Proteomics, as indicated in the \u2018experiment\u2019 column by Caprion_05, 06 and 06. if we do a batch retrieval using Uniref90 IDs from all 16 original mouse proteins, we find 12 human homologs were also detected in studies of orthopox infection. the identification of a hypothetical protein with differential gene and protein expressions in two host systems (mouse macrophage and HeLa cells) infected by different bacterial (Bacillus anthracis and Salmonella typhimurium) and viral (orthopox) pathogens suggest that this a protein interaction network was determined using a yeast-two hybrid assay to screen viral bait proteins against a library of prey proteins cloned from different tissues. the work from PNNL contained quantitative information in the form of spectral counts and Accurate Mass Tag intensities. a single human protein interacts with three viral proteins. the host protein Keratin, type II cytoskeletal 4 (P19013) interacts with three viral proteins. the 14 kDa fusion protein A27L is the most abundant protein seen. the host protein has tissue specificity in the suprabasal layer of the stratified epithelium of the esophagus, exocervix, vagina, mouth and lingual mucosa, and in cells and cell clusters in the mucosa and serous gland ducts of the esophageal submucosa. no receptor for virion attachment on the host cell surface has been found. an initial total of 327 proteins unique to the Bacillus anthracis proteome were identified using the CUPID and UniProtKB version 13.0. the species most closely related to the selected organism is based on the best BLAST hits of its entire proteome [54] the 21 proteins were screened for significant regions of similarity at the DNA level

results that represent either the gene or protein sequence for this single mouse protein. Using the UniRef90 cluster ID, we find the human homolog K1033_HUMAN was detected in HeLa cells infected with vaccinia and monkypox virus. if we do a batch retrieval using Uniref90 IDs from all 16 original mouse proteins, we find 12 human homologs were also detected in studies of orthopox infection. the identification of a hypothetical protein with differential gene and protein expressions in two host systems (mouse macrophage a protein interaction network was determined by a yeast-two hybrid assay. the work from PNNL contained quantitative information in the form of spectral counts and Accurate Mass Tag [27] intensities. a single human protein interacts with three viral proteins. the host protein Keratin, type II cytoskeletal 4 (P19013) interacts with three viral proteins. the 14 kDa fusion protein A27L is the most abundant protein seen in this data set. cytoskeletal 4 host protein has tissue specificity in the suprabasal layer of the stratified epithelium of the esophagus, exocervix, vagina, mouth and lingual mucosa, and in cells and cell clusters in the mucosa and serous gland ducts of the esophageal submucosa. little is known about mechanisms by which poxviruses attach to and enter host cells. an initial total of 327 proteins unique to the Bacillus anthracis proteome were identified using the CUPID and UniProtKB version 13.0. the species most closely related to the selected organism is based on the best BLAST hits of its entire proteome [54] the 21 proteins were screened for significant regions of similarity at the DNA level (either pseudogenes or unannotated genes) using tBLASTn against the NCBI nr database. this additional analysis resulted in a total of 10 Bacillus anthracis specific proteins proposed as high-quality targets for diagnostic probes. one protein identified as a target is a remnant of a prophage protein. another is from the pXO2 plasmid. a similar approach was taken for salmonella species using public PRC data. several candidate diagnostic proteins are currently being validated in the laboratory. most numerical values were not included in the MPD for the default search. if a new attribute appears or users request searches on a particular value omitted from the warehouse, adding it is a relatively simple matter of adding new data columns. in biology and research there always seems to be exceptions and new data and multiple approaches need to be accommodated. we have presented some unique examples to illustrate benefits associated with integration of a very diverse set of omics research data across different data types, laboratories and organisms. we illustrated with three examples how potential therapeutic and diagnostic targets can be identified from integrated data applying relatively simple and established tools and techniques."}
