{"summary": "poor hygiene of housing induces a systemic inflammatory response. selection for production performance can also influence reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and expression levels of genes involved in cellular response to oxidative stress. efficiency showed a lower susceptibility to oxidative stress induced by poor hygiene conditions. this could lead to a lower inflammatory response and less impaired growth when these pigs are facing sanitary challenges during the production period."}
