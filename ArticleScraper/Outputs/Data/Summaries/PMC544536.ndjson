{"summary": "in part 1 of this 2-part series, we describe the role and use of laws, as well as the demonstrated effectiveness of laws, in supporting selected public health interventions. the terrorist attacks of fall 2001 and events since then have focused immense attention on public health legal preparedness and on the role of law in assuring the public's health. despite the historically important role for law in public health, conceptual frameworks for the application of law to public health have not yet been fully explicated. the term \"legal framework\" is given further definition later in this 2-part article. law also includes policies or treaties adopted by international bodies. for chronic diseases, these goals necessitate a comprehensive strategy that includes interventions for prevention and control of categorical diseases and their risk factors, individual behavioral change, environmental change, improvements in clinical and preventive services. laws work to achieve their desired results in a variety of ways. some laws directly require a behavioral change on the part of individuals in the target population. others directly change the environment and require no new action on the part of the target population to be effective. use laws Unintentional injuries of older children, adolescents, and adults Strong evidence directly requires behavioral change Blood alcohol concentration limit of 0.08% for motor vehicles operators Unintentional injuries of older children, adolescents, and adults Strong evidence Primarily provides powerful psychological deterrent to invoke behavioral change. also provides disincentive to invoke behavioral change through fines and other penalties. the effectiveness of smoking bans should extend to most indoor workplaces in the united states. alcohol-related motor-vehicle crashes resulted in 17,380 deaths and more than 300,000 injuries in the united states. each study evaluated 0.08% BAC laws in one or more of the 16 states that implemented the laws before January 1, 1998. the median decrease in fatal alcohol-related motor-vehicle crashes was 7%. pellagra was the eighth or ninth leading cause of death in many southern states. international legal framework for tobacco control Policy interventions offer a great opportunity to influence decisions on tobacco use at the societal level. experience in the united states and in other developed countries indicates that policy interventions have a substantially greater impact than do interventions that target individuals. international law can be defined as the rules that regulate the relations between sovereign states and other actors (e.g., international organizations and individuals) in the international system (34). a logic model for the role of law in chronic disease prevention could trace the flow of causality involving laws, agents of intervention (i.e., the entities to which laws apply), the behavior of those agents (some behaviors affect the sources of chronic disease while others affect those susceptible to chronic disease) and health outcomes or status. identifying and strengthening key components of the public health infrastructure can be important purposes of appropriate legislation (13, 14) legislation can help provide state or local governments with the power to encourage or induce health care providers, allied health professionals, and businesses to promote and protect the public's health. 3 of these laws \u2014 smoking bans, blood alcohol concentration laws, and food fortification regulations \u2014 demonstrate the impact and effectiveness of legislation on specific public health problems. a fourth example, a legal framework for tobacco control, illustrate the potential role of international law to address chronic diseases and their major risk factors. smoking bans and restrictions Tobacco use is the single largest cause of preventable premature death in the united states. exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) is an important preventable cause of illness and death. BAC laws are hypothesized to exert their effect primarily through powerful psychological deterrence of alcohol consumption (28). most drivers are never stopped and tested for suspected alcohol-impaired driving. establishing the effectiveness of 0.08% BAC laws requires measurable reductions in alcohol-related motor-vehicle crashes. niacin deficiency accounted for approximately 100,000 cases of pellagra annually. pellagra was the eighth or ninth leading cause of death in many southern states. the BAC at which the majority of drivers are impaired can be established as the legal per se limit for motor vehicle operation. most drivers are never stopped and tested for suspected alcohol-impaired driving. establishing the effectiveness of 0.08% BAC laws requires measurable reductions in alcohol-related motor-vehicle crashes. each study evaluated 0.08% BAC laws in one or more of the 16 states that implemented the laws before January 1, 1998. the median decrease in fatal alcohol-related motor-vehicle crashes was 7%. estimated number of lives that could be saved annually if all states were to enact 0.08% BAC laws ranges from 400 to 600. international legal framework for tobacco control Policy interventions offer a great opportunity to influence decisions on tobacco use at the societal level. experience in the united states and in other developed countries indicates that policy interventions have a substantially greater impact than do interventions that target individuals. pellagra was the eighth or ninth leading cause of death in many southern states. the cause of pellagra was unknown before 1937, and pellagra was the eighth or ninth leading cause of death in many southern states. international legal framework for tobacco control (e.g., addressing international cigarette smuggling issues) and a framework for a broad range of legal, regulatory, and policy approaches (e.g., excise taxes, clean indoor air policies, restrictions or bans on advertising and promotion, package warnings and labeling, product regulations, and ingredient disclosures) all WHO member states are encouraged to implement. a logic model for the role of law in chronic disease prevention could trace the flow of causality involving laws, agents of intervention (i.e., the entities to which laws apply), the behavior of those agents (some behaviors affect the sources of chronic disease while others affect those susceptible to chronic disease) and health outcomes or status. the CDC will work with its partners to explore the development of these systematic legal frameworks as a tool for preventing chronic diseases and protecting and promoting the public's health. the frameworks will be a crucial addition to the tools available to the public health workforce."}
