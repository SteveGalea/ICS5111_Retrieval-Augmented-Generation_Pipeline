{"summary": "a new force seems to be at work in public health law and practice. consider, for example, the proliferation of references to \u2018preparedness\u2019. there is also increasing use of related phrases such as \u2018global public health security\u2019 and \u2018international health security\u2019. al health security may also have an impact on economic or political stability, trade, tourism, access to goods and services and, if they occur repeatedly, on demographic stability. the other term that requires some explanation is \u2018public health emergency legal preparedness\u2019. the first international health regulations (1969) and their predecessors, the international Sanitary Regulations (1951) were explicit about this link: they aimed to \u2018ensure the maximum security against the international spread of diseases with a minimum interference with world traffic\u2019. a third, more general, link between health and security arises from the fact that infectious diseases can \u2018erode governance capacities\u2019 and undermine \u2018a population's confidence and trust in the political leadership and system\u2019. 11 September 2001 (or 9/11) is the next crucial date in this short history. as a core component of its response to the events of 2001, the united states committed to a range of legislative and regulatory activity. in 2003, a new and serious infectious disease emerged: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), a new and serious infectious disease. in total, 8,098 cases of SARS were recorded in 26 countries. in total, 8,098 cases of SARS were recorded in 26 countries. 2003 is notable for more than the SARS outbreak and its containment. it was also the year in which the Commission on human security issued its final report. the commission labelled illness, disability and avoidable death as \u2018critical pervasive threats\u2019 to human security. the new regulations take what has been described as an \u2018all risks\u2019 approach. they include outbreaks of emerging and epidemic-prone diseases, outbreaks of food borne disease, natural disasters, accidental or deliberate release of pathogens, or chemical or radio-nuclear materials. health measures implemented by States Parties in response to identifiable risks must be 'no more invasive or intrusive to persons than reasonably available alternatives that would achieve appropriate level of health protection' this first response is likely to counter-claim that human rights have been explicitly built-in as part of the new IHR. it may also argue that States Parties have given WHO real power under the advisory provisions of the new IHR. there is another possible version of the \u2018what works\u2019 argument, which focuses on drawing-out the rights potential of the language of security. if, as seems to be the case in the counter-terrorism context, security and human rights are increasingly represented as in conflict. there is though a second, very different, human rights response to public health emergency preparedness and the wider securitisation of health. sceptics will agree that human rights are built into the IHR. the linkage-sceptic is likely to point to a problem arising from a less obvious source. a new link between human rights and risk has emerged, largely as a result of post 9/11 rhetoric about life in a \u2018time of crisis\u2019. a new link between human rights and risk has emerged, largely as a result of post 9/11 rhetoric. human rights are no more than a tool used and abused by \u2018minorities\u2019, especially \u2018dangerous, violent minorities\u2019. this tends to be accompanied by another claim: it is the right to security of \u2018law-abiding, decent people\u2019 to live safe and secure from crime and violence that has been neglected and needs shoring up. in what follows, we try to address our split reaction by thinking through how human rights could engage more effectively with security. we focus on risk, an increasingly common thread in contemporary debates about security. we argue that in order to answer this, human rights advocates need to direct greater critical attention towards prevailing interpretations of the relationship between risk and rights. rights as risk also encompasses the potential for human rights consciousness (as manifested, for example, in a public campaign) to disrupt the interests and overall standing of governments and organisations. 'risk within rights' is not new ground for human rights lawyers. a change has taken place due to the new societal emphasis on (in)security and public protection. in some jurisdictions, the new post 9/11 national security context has generated strong demand for greater prioritisation of risk66. critical counter-terrorism scholarship should be seen as relevant in developing an account of risk-based evidence and its relationship to human rights. critics have begun to advocate a direct linkage between risk expertise and human rights standards. a striking feature of contemporary security debates is the increased reliance on risk-based evidence and expertise. a striking feature of contemporary security debates, in the terrorism and public health fields, is the increased reliance on risk-based evidence. rights as risk We shift now to the complex terrain of \u2018rights as risk\u2019. a human rights engagement with \u2018rights as risk\u2019 is both necessary and undeniably complex. human rights are a particularly complex organisational risk. a wide range of influences, demands and obligations have the capacity to lead to the construction of rights as a risk in the field of public health emergency preparedness. the cross-sector and cross-jurisdiction nature of public health emergencies creates an especially complex governance landscape. a strong states' rights tradition can hamper, or be used as an excuse by, federal government in developing particular national preparedness measures. a tradition of strong states' rights could be a bulwark against such abuse. a study of divergent uses of quarantine in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Toronto. 'public justification, deliberation, and other relationship-building activities may be more important for biopreparedness than state power because they maintain and nurture civic ideals, cooperation, and trust' the Russian government treats human rights of [Persons Living With HIV/AIDS] as a politically-charged issue. she labels the first \u2018instrumental\u2019 and the second \u2018intrinsic\u2019. staff who adopt an intrinsic framework draw on moral or legal imperatives. there is a lot for human rights advocates to address here. are human rights risk strategists at work in public health preparedness projects? are they picking up on the argument made by Francis and others that it is not merely questions of justice within pandemic planning that demand attention. the counter-argument to this is that human rights advocacy has always been complex. it cannot be denied that human rights \u2018victories\u2019 have sometimes had unexpected, negative consequences. on occasion, they have been used by governments as a basis from which to claim that action has been taken and no further governmental action is required. the principle of proportionality is a key component of the latter \u2018democratic necessity\u2019 test. for the European Court of Human Rights, the principle of proportionality is a key component of the latter \u2018democratic necessity\u2019 test. a new critical counter-terrorism scholarship is fighting this dangerous turn. three insights from critical counter-terrorism scholarship merit particular attention. a human rights spotlight on the language and practices of risk assessment and management is essential in order to evaluate the legitimacy of responses to public health threats. critical counter-terrorism scholarship should also be seen as relevant in developing an account of risk-based evidence and its relationship to human rights. the approach could help to bring consistency and coherence to the \u2018balancing [of] the common public health good with individual rights\u2019. a striking feature of contemporary security debates, in the terrorism and public health fields, is the increased reliance on risk-based evidence and expertise. a striking feature of contemporary security debates, in the terrorism and public health fields, is the increased reliance on risk-based evidence and expertise. organisational risk is an umbrella term covering the possible risks affecting an organisation. the organisational risks that have to be managed vary widely and are generally classed as reputational, financial, legal, political and operational in nature. global health governance is characterised by an increasingly influential role for hybrid and non-state actors. in federal states, the legal relationship between federal and local government may constitute rights as a risk in the public health emergency field. in federal states, the legal relationship between federal and local government may constitute rights as a risk in the public health emergency field. a study of the divergent uses of quarantine in. Hong Kong, Shanghai and Toronto during the. SARS crisis. lesley Jacobs attributes the more extensive use of quarantine in. Toronto to the particular legal consciousness of senior public health officials. organisational cultures also \u2018shape how human rights are framed, interpreted and institutionalised\u2019. the extent of internalisation of human rights within WHO is crucial. human rights advocates need to recognise the growing significance of organisational risk and how organisational culture intertwines with risk and rights. human rights needs to reflect on emergence, from within its ranks, of the \u2018human rights risk strategist\u2019. there are serious questions of justice to be asked about the allocation of extensive resources to pandemic planning. 'Pandemic myopia', in other words, is a seriously flawed approach to pandemic planning99. rights as risk is not home-ground for human rights advocacy. human rights advocates have little choice but to respond in some fashion. critiquing public health emergency preparedness is undeniably hard. we have suggested a preliminary agenda to address the human rights gap. preparedness could well involve self-critique as human rights advocacy works towards a more differentiated analysis of how security should be engaged and what it means to do human rights today. human rights preparedness is likely to be human rights without a safety net."}
