{"summary": "influenza activity fluctuates throughout the year in temperate and tropical/subtropical regions. temperate regions typically experiencing a single epidemic peak in winter. tropical/subtropical areas are characterized by more complex dynamics with multiple epidemics throughout the year. influenza epidemiological and genetic data were available for the pre-pandemic period January 1997 to June 2009. we combined influenza epidemiological and genetic data from the two cities to assess seasonality differences and evolutionary distances between the two locales. we hypothesized that increased connectivity between Shenzhen and Hong Kong would promote epidemic synchrony. seasonality of influenza epidemics and monthly distribution of influenza virus subtypes in Shenzhen and Hong Kong. time series of influenza-positive specimens in shenzhen (red line) and shenzhen (red line) from 1997 to June 2009. phase differences between shenzhen and Hong Kong (green line). there was little similarity in influenza genotype distribution between shenzhen and Hong Kong. influenza A/H3N2 was dominant in 2003, early 2007 and early 2009 in Shenzhen, while A/H3N2 was dominant in 2006 and in winter 2008\u20132009 in Hong Kong. the isolates in Shenzhen became gradually more genetically similar to the putative source viruses, up to the level maintained by Hong Kong throughout the study period. we performed several sensitivity analyses with the genetic data to test the impact of sampling intensity and design. we subsampled the Hong Kong viral sequence data to create 1000 mock datasets that were equivalent in size to the Shenzhen dataset. however, in a multivariate regression of distance against time and the number of sequences, the number of sequences dropped out of the model. this would indicate that the trend is robust and is unlikely to be the result of sparse sampling. synchrony in Hong Kong and Shenzhen influenza epidemics from 1997 to 2009 Epidemiological data were available for the pre-pandemic period January 1997 to June 2009. 45 974 laboratory-confirmed influenza cases among 329 094 specimens tested in Hong Kong (14.0 % positive) and 1704 influenza positives among 21 768 specimens tested in Shenzhen. seasonal influenza A virus subtype H3N2 (A/H3N2), green bars, influenza B virus (B); purple bars, 2009 pandemic influenza A virus subtype H1N1 (pdmH1N1) since 2006, the timing of the annual epidemic cycles in Shenzhen and Hong Kong has become more similar. the genetic distance between the two cities declined over time. we estimated the genetic distance from each HA sequence to the \u2018trunk\u2019 of a global phylogenetic tree. the minimum distance from the Hong Kong isolates to the trunk was small. we performed several sensitivity analyses with the genetic data to test the impact of sampling intensity and design. there was no significant difference in minimum distance from the global trunk between winter and summer isolates (paired t-test matching estimates by year, P>0.05). study focuses on influenza dynamics and travel patterns from the mid-1990s to the emergence of the A/H1N1 pandemic virus in china in 2009. despite geographical proximity and shared climate, the two cities experienced distinct influenza seasonality and epidemic timing. epidemic synchrony between the two cities has increased in the more recent years, in parallel to increasing similarity in genetic composition of the viral populations. shenzhen and Hong Kong share the same subtropical climate with synchronous peaks and troughs in temperature and humidity. if local climate was a major driver of influenza seasonality in the region, we would expect similar influenza seasonal patterns in the two cities. phylogenetic analysis shows that the viruses from Hong Kong were closer to the global putative source virus pool than the viruses from Shenzhen. this suggests that in general, Hong Kong is better connected to the rest of the world than Shenzhen. the number of diagnostic tests and sampling in Shenzhen increased dramatically during the study period, perhaps increasing the chances of detecting virus strains closer to the trunk of the global phylogenetic tree. the isolation month was unavailable for Shenzhen sequences, preventing us from controlling for potential genetic variations in the virus within a calendar year. this pattern echoes historical studies of influenza epidemics in Iceland. there was no trend in influenza epidemic synchrony within the USA. the relationship between population mixing and influenza dynamics has not been fully elucidated. influenza laboratory surveillance data from Hong Kong between January 1997 and June 2009 were obtained from the department of health and accessed through the Centre for health protection website. nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from influenza-like illness patients visiting general practitioners or outpatient clinics and from patients hospitalized with acute respiratory diseases. collection dates were between 1995 and 2009 with only the year of isolation available. publicly accessible information about the monthly number of mainland Chinese visitor arrivals to Hong Kong by land during January 2001 and June 2009 and the monthly number of Hong Kong residents travelling to mainland China by land during July 2004 and June 2009. all available HA sequences of human influenza A/H3N2 viruses were subject to phylogeny reconstruction by a maximum-likelihood (ML) method implemented in RAxML. a total of 200 independent searches for ML phylogenies were performed with different random maximum-parsimony starting trees. the phylogeny with the highest likelihood score was selected for further analysis. the estimates for the shortest distance to the trunk were evaluated to determine whether they were influenced by the number of isolates tested in each city and each year. to do this, we generated 1000 random subsets of the Hong Kong data equivalent in size to the smaller Shenzhen dataset. influenza laboratory surveillance data were obtained from the shenzhen center for disease control between January 1997 and June 2009. in total, there were 329 094 respiratory specimens tested in Hong Kong and 21 768 specimens tested in Shenzhen during the study period. influenza virus samples used in this study were collected as part of an ongoing and nationally approved influenza surveillance programme. we compiled monthly proxies of influenza virus incidence in Shenzhen and Hong Kong. time series were square-root transformed prior to analysis to stabilize variance. time series were square-root transformed prior to analysis to stabilize variance. a total of 200 independent searches for ML phylogenies were performed with different
