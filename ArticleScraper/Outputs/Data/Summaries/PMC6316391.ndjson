{"summary": "asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the conducting airways. it is associated with mucus overproduction and airway remodeling. most children and roughly 50% of adult asthma patients have allergic asthma. human RSV-A [14] human RSV-A [16] human RSV-A [17] human RSV-A [17] human RSV-A [17] hMPV [20] hMPV [21,22] hMPV [23] paramyxoviridae Respirovirus human Respirovirus 1,3 hPIV3 [24] hPIV3 [26] hPIV3 [27] hPIV3 [27] asthma development is modeled in small animals by administration of virus in immature mice. mice are infected with human rhinovirus (HRV) to simulate an asthma exacerbation. the combination of house dust mite exposure and viral infection induces an additive increase in airway eosinophils. ender b Route c Virus Strains/Isolates Inoculum d Dura-Tion e Detection Method Applications and MajorObservations Reference HRV BALB/c mice 6 weeks F i.n.

HRV has an icosahedral, non-enveloped viral capsid. there are now 167 serotypes of HRV in three phylogenetic species. HRV is responsible for about half of the viral infections. the prevalence of rhinovirus may be even higher depending on the time of year. accumulating evidence suggests a link between early-life wheezing-associated HRV infection and later asthma development. major group serotypes like HRV-16 fail to infect mouse cell lines without artificial expression of human ICAM-1 or chimeric ICAM-1 with human domains. a minor group serotype HRV-A1A infects mouse cell lines and replicates more efficiently in mouse lower respiratory epithelial cells. the requirement for high titer HRV-A16 in transgenic mice expressing human ICAM-1 suggests there are other factors which limit replication in mice besides the viral receptor. the mouse is only \u201csemi-permissive\u201d to HRV infection, based on the limited viral replication and rapid decline in viral titers. HRV-A1B infection of mice deficient in Tbet exhibits T helper cell-dependent airway eosinophilia and mucus production. this suggests that Th2 responses play an important role in driving features of allergic airway diseases during asthma exacerbations. CD11b+ cells from OVA-treated, HRV-infected CD11b-DTR mice show M2 polarization and depletion of CD11b+, IL-13-producing cells in, decreased airway inflammation and responsiveness. HRV colocalizes with CD68+ CD11b+ macrophages following experimental infection in humans. the airway epithelium also includes resident dendritic cells that respond to allergens, pathogens and damage signals. innate cytokines (IL-25, IL-33 and TSLP) play a special role as they activate type 2 helper T (Th2) cells and type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) leading to mucous metaplasia. initiation of type 2 inflammation by viruses may not require allergen exposure. Immature mice (younger than 7 days of age) have been used as age-appropriate model to study virus-mediated chronic immunopathology and asthma development. a delayed and prolonged type 2 immune response is featured with increased expression of IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13, as well as mucous metaplasia and airways hyperresponsiveness. SR3335 treatment decreases the number of lung ILC2s as well as mucous metaplasia in both immature and adult mice. increased expression level of the epithelial-derived innate cytokines IL-25, IL-33 and TSLP is observed in HRV-infected immature mice. treatment with recombinant IFN- inhibits ILC2 proliferation and activation as well as development of the asthma-like phenotype. HRV is the most common cause of asthma and COPD exacerbations. outpatient children with asthma attacks show 62\u201381% positivity for viral infection versus only well children with 12\u201341% positivity. HRV was detected in one third of infants hospitalized for wheezing. 60% of HRV-positive cases were diagnosed with asthma 6 years later. a small animal model is useful to understand the pathogenesis of HRV infection. adapted viruses account for the phenotype for HRV-A16 [116] and HRV-A1A [119], respectively. adapted viruses did not show improved replication in vivo. high doses (5 106 TCID50, tissue-culture infective dose) of HRV-A16 are needed to induce extensive peribronchial and perivascular inflammatory infiltrates. use of HRV animal models has elucidated important signaling pathways, proteins and receptors involved in HRV-mediated airway inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness in nave mice. phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase [5], E3 ubiquitin ligase midline 1 (MID1) [49], tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) [50], melanoma differentiation-associated HRV infection triggers eosinophilic inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness, along with increased expression of mucins (Muc5AC and Muc5B), eotaxin-1/CCL11, IL-4 and IL-13. the macrophage plays an indispensable role in eosinophilic infiltration and airway responsiveness in HRV-infected OVA-treated mice [46,47] LP and IL-25 are epithelial-derived innate cytokines. they stimulate production of type 2 cytokines via stimulation of Th2 helper cells and type 2 innate lymphoid cells. pDC abrogates HRV-induced inflammation and plasmacytoid dendritic cell recruitment to the lung. a classic Th2-driven response was not observed and HRV infection caused additive effects on airway neutrophilic inflammation as well as IgE level and airway responsiveness. in mice receiving intranasal exposure of high-dose HDM at early time points, HRV infection triggers both type 1 and type 2 responses. g SR3335, a chemical inhibitor for ILC2-related transcription factor RAR-related orphan receptor alpha (ROR) treatment decreases the number of lung ILC2s as well as mucous metaplasia in both immature and adult mice. administration of anti-IL-13 neutralizing antibody can reduce the asthma-like phenotype. EV-D68 has been considered rare until a worldwide upsurge in detection of EV-D68 in the last decade [136,137,138,139,140]. EV-D68 is a non-polio human enterovirus belonging to Group D, the enterovirus genus, whose members are characterized by a small icosahedral viral capsid and with a single positive positive. EV-D68 strains consist of four major genetic clades A, B, C and recently suggested clade D. a later report suggests both 2,6- and 2,3-lined sialic acid function as cellular EV-D68 receptors and sialic acid-independent EV-D68 variants have been identified. EV-D68 replicated to a limited extent in both nose and lung. compared with HRV-A1B infection, EV-D68 induced higher IL-17 mRNA and protein. EV-D68 in the ferret lung increased lung protein abundance of IL-1, IL-5, IL-8, IL-12, IL-13 and IL-17a as well as alveolar inflammation and hemorrhage. five 2014 circulating strains and two prototype strains were used to intracerebrally infect 2 day old mice. four out of five of the 2014 circulating strains led to paralysis and/or neonatal death. in mice with allergic airways disease, EV-D68 enhances allergen-induced type 2 inflammation with increased expression of lung IL-5, IL-13 and muc5ac. in mice with allergic airways disease, EV-D68 enhances allergen-induced type 2 inflammation with increased expression of lung IL-5, IL-13 and muc5ac. a worldwide upsurge in detection of EV-D68 in the last decade. a case-control study from the 2014 AFM cases in Colorado suggested an association of EV-D68 [148]. EV-D68 is a non-polio human enterovirus belonging to Group D, the enterovirus genus, whose members are characterized by a small icosahedral viral capsid and with a single positive-stranded RNA genome. the ability of EV-D68 to infect the mouse respiratory tract was initially evaluated using cotton rats. three EV-D68 isolates, the prototype Fermon strain, pre-outbreak isolate VANBT/1 and outbreak isolate US/MO/14-18949, were given through intranasal route with a titer of 106 TCID50. a large amount of viral RNA was found in the feces, nasal swab, lymph node and lung. the viral load was low in trachea, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and blood. no virus was detected from the central nervous system or throat swabs. intraperitoneal infection of one-day-old Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice with EV-D68 strains US/MO/14-18947 and US/KY/14-18953 but not Fermon strain caused limb paralysis and death. limb paralysis and death was age- and virus dose-dependent. animal models of EV-D68 induced asthma exacerbation EV-D68 preferentially causes severe respiratory symptoms in children and adults that have a prior history of asthma. in mice with allergic airways disease, EV-D68 enhances allergen-induced type 2 inflammation with increased expression of lung IL-5, IL-13 and Muc5ac. human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the major cause of serious respiratory disease in infants and young neumoviruses are enveloped viruses with the genome organized with a negative-sense, non-segmented RNA. a two-step process is used for RSV entry, a viral glycoprotein-mediated attachment step and a fusion step through binding of the viral fusion protein (F protein) to the receptor nucleolin. in the lower airway, the airway epithelium is the primary infection site and macrophages in the lung may be infected as well human RSV infects both upper and lower respiratory tracts and triggers production of IL-1, IL-1, TNF-, IFN-, IL-17 and various chemokines. the cotton rat is also permissive for human RSV with a similar viral growth kinetic as the mouse. the human RSV mouse model has been widely used for the study of pathogenesis and vaccine development. long [13] and A2 strains [58] of RSV have been the standard laboratory strains employed to infect mice. in the lung, RSV titers peak on days 4 to 6 post-infection and decline to undetectable at day 11 [58,59] a genome-wide association study of disease following human RSV infection in 30 inbred strains of mice identified several potential genetic determinants for RSV susceptibility. acute RSV infection causes pulmonary cytotoxic responses in the lung with increased populations of natural killer (NK) cells and CD8+ T cells. conventional CD103+ DCs are essential to promote CD8+ T cell responses. plasmacytoid DC and its derived semaphorin 4a are indispensable for Treg expansion during HRSV infection. experimental infection using the human RSV A2 strain does not trigger eosinophilic inflammation or abundant Th2 cytokine expression. anti-IL-25 treatment or TLSPR KO blocks RSV Line 19-induced airway hyperresponsiveness and mucus production. no significant viral replication difference between strains A2 and Line 19 has been observed. fusion gene of line 19 strain has been identified as a mucogenic virulence factor. human RSV infection prolongs airway lymphocytic inflammation, mucus deposition and methacholine-induced airway hyperresponsiveness. expression of mucus-related genes Muc5ac and Gob-5 is also increased in OVA-treated, RSV-infected mice [215]. Interestingly, IL-17A knockout mice show more IL-13 production. immature mouse models with mice age ranging from 1 day to three weeks have been used to closely mimic the interaction between RSV and the human infant immune system. antigen-specific and IFN-expressing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are recruited to the lung tissue and airway which peak 8\u201310 days post-infection. however, T cell recruitment in the airway is reduced in RSV-infected immature mice compared to adults. mouse studies show that the age of initial infection is a risk factor for subsequent RSV-mediated disease. recombinant HRSV rA2-Line 19F has been used to optimize the neonatal RSV infection model. early-life human RSV infection predisposes mice to enhanced allergic airway disease and Th2 responses to allergen exposure in adulthood [232] primary RSV infection protects adult mice from OVA-induced allergic responses by inhibiting ILC2 [233] repeating RSV infection in OVA-tolerized infant mice impairs Treg function by inducing a Th2-like effector phenotype. human RSV is a member of the Pneumoviridae family, Orthopneumovirus genus. it is enveloped viruses with the genome organized with a negative-sense, non-segmented RNA. a two-step process is used for RSV entry, a viral glycoprotein-mediated attachment step and a fusion step. in guinea pigs, human RSV infection causes acute bronchiolitis without clinical signs and weight loss [15]. Interestingly, RSV persistence has been observed in infected lung of guinea pigs up to 60 days [73,174]. f and PMV/mouse represent alternative approaches to the study of orthopneumoviruses infections. infection of bRSV and PMV induce a similar immune cell responses as human RSV infection, such as CD8 +T cells and pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses. a genome-wide association study of disease following human RSV infection in 30 inbred strains of mice identified several potential genetic determinants for RSV susceptibility. the age dependence of viral replication in the lung has been documented. acute RSV infection causes pulmonary cytotoxic responses in mice. CD8+ T and NK cells are involved in pathogen clearance and immunopathology during RSV infection [193,192] NK cells cause lethal immunopathology upon RSV reinfection [193,195,196] Regulatory T cells also reduce the immunopathology and airway inflammation by limiting both innate and adaptive immunity. line 19 strain induces dose-responsive airway hyperresponsiveness, mucus metaplasia and IL-13 expression in 6-week old BALB/c mice. anti-IL-25 treatment or TLSPR KO blocks RSV Line 19-induced airway hyperresponsiveness and mucus production. no significant viral replication difference between strains A2 and Line 19 has been observed. ILC2s have been determined to be the major early source of IL-13 production in A2001/2-20-infected adult mice. expression of mucus-related genes Muc5ac and Gob-5 is also increased in OVA-treated, RSV-infected mice. immature mouse models with mice age ranging from 1 day to three weeks have been used to closely mimic the interaction between RSV and the human infant immune system. antigen-specific and IFN-expressing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are recruited to the lung tissue and airway which peak 8\u201310 days post-infection. the CD8+ T cell response is also age-dependent and limited in 7-day old mice compared to adults. CD103low DCs are phenotypically immature with lower expression of lineage-defining and maturation markers. a type 2 skewed immune response has been observed in human neonatal mice. Immature mice have shown reduced and delayed IFN- responses. a cohort of Swedish infants with severe RSV bronchiolitis requiring hospitalization later developed asthma which continued into young adulthood. early-life human RSV infection predisposes mice to enhanced allergic airway disease and Th2 responses to allergen exposure in adulthood [232], suggesting that early-life human RSV infection could alter responses to allergen exposure. hMPV is a member of the Pneumoviridae family, Metapneumovirus Genus. hMPV contains a non-segmented, negative-sense RNA genome. hMPV lacks the non-structural proteins NS1 and NS2 of RSV. hMPV replication shows biphasic growth kinetic with two peaks of viral titer at 7 days and 14\u201328 days after infection. hMPV can persist in the lung with recovered infectious virus up to 60 days and detectable viral genomic RNA over 180 days. infected-mice show clinical symptoms consisting of breathing difficulties, ruffled fur and weight loss. hMPV infection causes more severe airway obstruction, weight loss and histopathology. more neutrophils and activated NK cells were recruited in hMPV-infected mice. hMPV infection has been linked to asthma exacerbation. hMPV lacks non-structural proteins NS1 and NS2 of RSV. gene order of hMPV and hMPV varies significantly. hamsters and ferrets most permissive tor hMPV replication. hMPV infection causes more severe airway obstruction, weight loss and histopathology. more neutrophils and activated NK cells were recruited in hMPV-infected mice. hPIVs are characterized by an enveloped virion and single-stranded negative-sense RNA genome. hPIVs are genetically and antigenically divided into types 1 to 4. hPIVs cause both upper and lower respiratory infections. hPIVs have been detected in asthma patients [267,268,269] but few studies correlating hPIV infection and asthma development or exacerbation. hPIV replication peaks within 48 h, with histologic changes including epithelial damage and inflammatory infiltrates. seV infection causes dose-dependent effects in mice ranging from no effect to reversible bronchiolitis to lethal bronchopneumonia. inflammatory infiltrates include neutrophils, lymphocytes and monocytes/macrophages. persistent infection of SeV in the nerve tissue has been linked to chronic asthma development [282] in guinea pigs, SeV infection alters vagal afferent innervation in the airways with increased tachykinin expression in both nociceptive-like and non-nociceptive neurons. hPIVs are characterized by an enveloped virion and single-stranded negative-sense RNA genome. hPIVs cause both upper and lower respiratory infections with clinical presentations including cough, acute laryngotracheobronchitis (croup) and tracheobronchitis. hPIVs have been detected in asthma patients [267,268,269] but there are few studies correlating hPIV infection and asthma development or exacerbation. in hamsters and cotton rats, hPIV3 replication peaks within 48 h, with histologic changes including epithelial damage and inflammatory infiltrates. seV antigens are detected in both bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial cells in infected rats and mice [28,74]. SeV infection causes dose-dependent effects in mice ranging from no effect to reversible bronchiolitis to lethal bronchopneumonia. persistent infection of SeV in the nerve tissue has been linked to chronic asthma development. the effects of early life SeV infection on later asthma development has also been extensively studied in rats. human Coronavirus (HCoV) and human Bocaviruses (HBoV) have been associated with self-limiting respiratory tract infections in human. severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV cause severe respiratory disease in human. human respiratory viral infections are strongly associated with asthma exacerbations. researchers have therefore studied human respiratory viral infections in small animals, with the mouse being the predominant species studied. researchers have touched on the difficulties and limitations of animal models for determining pathways of virus-induced asthma. further experimentation in mouse models will contribute to the development of new therapeutic interventions for asthma."}
