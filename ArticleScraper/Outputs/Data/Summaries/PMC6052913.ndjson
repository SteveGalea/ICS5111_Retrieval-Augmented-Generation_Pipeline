{"summary": "a PubMed search was completed using the key terms 'febrile convulsions' and 'febrile seizures' the majority of febrile seizures occur within 24 hours of the onset of the fever. febrile seizures are the most common neurologic disorder in the pediatric age group. it affects 2\u20135% of children between 6 months and 5 years of age in the united states and western Europe with a peak incidence between 12 and 18 months. febrile seizures occur mainly in children before the age of 3 years when the seizure threshold is low. the risk for febrile seizure for a child is about 20% with an affected sibling and about 33% with affected parents. the risk of febrile seizures is temporarily increased for a few days after the administration of certain vaccines. other vaccines implicated as causes of postvaccination febrile seizures include combined diphtheria\u2013tetanus toxoids\u2013whole-cell pertussis vaccine. febrile seizures can be classified as simple or complex based on duration, physical characteristics, and recurrence patterns. simple febrile seizures account for about 80\u201385% of all febrile seizures. re may have a prolonged period of postictal drowsiness or be associated with postictal transient hemiparesis (Todd\u2019s palsy) children with complex febrile seizures are younger and more likely to have delay in development than those with simple febrile seizures. the examination should search for signs of meningitis such as irritability, depressed sensorium, nuchal rigidity, bulging or tense fontanel. a fundus examination should be performed to look for increased intracranial pressure. a unilateral port-wine stain over the trigeminal area is suggestive of Sturge\u2013Weber syndrome; facial angiofibromas, shagreen or leather patches, periungual/ungual fibromas (Koen the absence of fever, tonic\u2013clonic movements of the limbs, and rolling back of the eyeballs distinguishes this condition from febrile seizure. children with CNS infection such as meningitis and encephalitis typically present with fever and seizure. NORSE is a clinical presentation, but not a specific diagnosis, in a patient without active epilepsy or other existing relevant neurological disorder. it is difficult to distinguish the first episode of febrile seizure from a seizure resulting from epilepsy, GEFS+, and FIRES in a child with fever. a complete blood cell count should be considered in children who appear ill. a lumbar puncture should be considered in children 12 months of age who present with a febrile seizure regardless of their immunization status. the procedure should also be considered in children with symptoms or signs of meningitis or febrile status epilepticus. children with simple febrile seizures have a slightly higher risk of subsequent epilepsy of around 1% compared with the incidence in the general population of approximately 0.5%. the risk of future epilepsy in children with complex febrile seizures is around 4\u20136%. febrile seizures do not alter the risk of subsequent epilepsy. a population-based cohort study in Rotterdam showed no association of febrile seizures with the risk of behavioral problems or executive functioning. studies on the relationship between febrile seizures and developmental coordination disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and intellectual disability have yielded contradictory results. children with febrile seizures are at increased risk for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. the adjusted hazard ratio for Tourette syndrome in relation to febrile seizure-related medical visits was 1.02 (95% CI: 1.02\u20131.03) per one frequency increment. children with febrile seizures can die suddenly and unexpectedly in a manner reminiscent of adult sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. risk factors include age of onset 15 months, relatively lower temperature at the time of the first febrile seizure, febrile seizure and epilepsy in a first-degree relative, day-care attendee, frequent febrile illnesses, multiple febrile seizures during the same febrile illness. the greater the number of risk factors, the higher the recurrence rate. status epilepticus rarely stops spontaneously and often requires more than one antiepileptic medication to control. the initial treatment consists of intravenous administration of lorazepam (0.1 mg/kg) or diazepam (0.2 mg/kg) or diazepam (0.2 mg/kg) can be repeated intravenously. children admitted to hospital should be monitored with pulse oximetry. hypoxic children should be given oxygen through nasal cannulae, head box, face mask, or high-flow delivery device to maintain SaO2 >92%. an antipyretic may be given if the fever is high enough to cause discomfort in the child. daily administration of valproic acid (10\u201315 mg/kg/day in divided doses) or phenobarbital (5\u20138 mg/kg/day for children 2 years of age and 3\u20135 mg/kg/day for children >2 years of age in divided doses) effective in the prevention of febrile seizures. salehiomran et al. conducted a single-blind, randomized clinical trial on children with febrile seizures. 74 children (mean age 20.597.93 months) received oral phenobarbital 3\u20135 mg/kg/day in two divided doses for at least one year. recurrence rate was 17/74 (23%) in the phenobarbital group. the use of intermittent anticonvulsant in preventing febrile seizures is not routinely indicated. 79 out of 328 children (22.7%) in the treatment group and 43 out of 192 children (24.4%) in the placebo group had recurrence of febrile seizures. effective childhood vaccinations help reduce morbidity and mortality attributable to many infectious diseases. some of these diseases may cause fever and febrile seizures. universal childhood vaccinations should be strongly encouraged to reduce the risk of febrile seizures in the years to come."}
