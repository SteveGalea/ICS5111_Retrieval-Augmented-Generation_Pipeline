{"summary": "amputation of the digit was required despite repeated surgical debridement and decompression. self-injection with veterinary vaccines is an occupational hazard for farmers and veterinary surgeons. a 20-year-old herdsman accidentally injected his right little finger with the combined bovine vaccine. Approximately 1 ml of vaccine was injected under hand injecting pressure. he attended the Accident and Emergency department and was treated with oral Augmentin and a sling to elevate the hand. the patient was discharged on oral Cefuroxine antibiotics. the wound was discharging pus and he had tracking lymphangitis to the axilla. a non-itchy rash with circular macules had developed over his chest and neck. the rash was thought to be a reaction to the antibiotic. two months after the amputation the patient was seen complaining of some pain in the fifth metacarpal of the right hand. a dermatologist diagnosed the rash as pityriasis versicolor due to a malassezia furfur infection on the skin. oil based veterinary vaccines have previously been reported to cause a prolonged chronic granulomatous reaction with sterile abscess formation. amputation of the dominant thumb at the metacarpophalangeal joint has been reported following an injection of a pig parvovirus vaccine [10] and another patient lost the terminal phalanx of a finger [12]. this case illustrates the seriousness of such an injury despite early surgical treatment. early debridement and irrigation of the injected area with decompression is likely to give the best outcome."}
