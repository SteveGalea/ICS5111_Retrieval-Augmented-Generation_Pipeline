{"summary": "the 21st century has witnessed the emergence of many new infectious diseases of serious public health implications from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) to avian influenza (H5N1) this major public health threat has huge socioeconomic impact in the developing countries like india. chikungunya in india is a recent example of such diseases. new infectious diseases of public health importance since 1973. list includes CCHF, Ebola virus disease (EVD) and Marburg, Lassa fever, MERS and SARS coronavirus diseases, Nipah, and Rift Valley fever. global examples of emerging, re-emerging and deliberately emerging (linked to bioterrorism) disease are just overwhelming [Figure 1] for a large part of these EIDs, Asia remains the epicenter. EVD in west africa was first reported during early March 2014 in Guinea's 3 southeastern prefectures. it spread across land borders to liberia and then to liberia and Sierra Leone. there have been more cases and deaths in this outbreak than all others combined. in 1994, there was a pneumonic plague epidemic in Surat, India. a localized outbreak of bubonic plague occurred in Dangud village in district Uttarkashi, Uttarakhand, in October 2004. a new serogroup of Vibrio cholerae O139 was associated with this epidemic cholera. india accounted for 19%\u201384% of the global burden of diphtheria from 1998 to 2008. these outbreaks revealed an epidemiological age shift with the disease currently affecting older children of 5\u201319 years age group and adults. a dangerous EID was established only after the outbreak in Andhra Pradesh in 2003. it was associated with causing large-scale encephalitis outbreak in children 9\u201315 years in various districts of Andhra Pradesh with high case fatality rate (55.6). During the same period in the Nagpur region of Maharashtra, 33 cases were confirmed as Chandipura with a case fatality rate of 41%. india reported 5,253 cases and 699 deaths with a case fatality rate of 13.3%. by mid-February 2015, the reported cases and deaths had surpassed the previous numbers. CCHF is endemic in africa, the Balkans, the Middle East and Asia. chikungunya re-emerged in the country after a gap of three decades. in 2006, total 1.39 million clinically suspected chikungunya cases were reported. in about 50% of cases, the causative agent remains elusive. around 15.5% are diagnosed as cases of Japanese Encephalitis (JE) JE is endemic in 179 districts of 21 states of which assam, Bihar, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, and west Bengal have been reporting more than 80% of disease burden. surveillance units have been established in all states/districts and central surveillance unit is established. training of state/district surveillance teams and rapid response teams has been completed for all 35 states/UTs. the IHR (2005) are intended to have long-lasting relevance in international response to the emergence and spread of disease. they are intended to have long-lasting relevance in international response to the emergence and spread of disease. the IHR (2005) are not limited to specific diseases but apply to new and ever-changing public health risks. GOARN is a multidisciplinary technical collaboration of over 200 technical institutions and networks. it works with over 600 partners worldwide, including national public health institutions and hospitals, ministries of health, academic, research and technical institutions. in 2009, the GDD center in India supported effective response to 74 outbreaks. many new viral agents are adding to the pool of infections. newer surveillance strategies and global diseases detection programme and international cooperation form the cornerstone in prevention and control of this menace."}
