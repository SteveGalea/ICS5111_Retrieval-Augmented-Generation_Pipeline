{"summary": "mycetoma is a chronic granulomatous subcutaneous inflammatory disease. it is caused by certain bacteria (actinomycetoma) or fungi (eumycetoma) it progresses to affect the deep structures and bones leading to massive destruction, deformities and disabilities. it is highly endemic in many tropical and subtropical countries. hyphae induced a Th1 response [10], whereas hyphae induced a Th1 response. lipids suppressed expression of major histocompatibility complex class II. lipids suppressed expression of major histocompatibility complex class II. IL-1 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is involved in cell death coordination. it is possible that mature IL-1 secretion by macrophages activates IL-1 receptor type 1 (IL-1R1) on macrophages, fibroblasts and epithelial cells. these higher levels of IL-1 cytokine advocate a crucial role in M. mycetomatis pathogenesis. in vivo, IL-37 transgene protects mice from lipopolysaccharides-induced shock and chemical-induced colitis. IL-37 plays a pivotal role in regulating adaptive immunity by inducing T regulatory (Treg) cells and impairing activation of effector T-cell responses. there has been no study to report the relationship between IL-37 and mycetoma pathogenesis. IL-35 is a potent immunosuppressive cytokine produced by B regulatory cells (Breg) [35], DCs [36], and to a lesser extent, by endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and monocytes. IL-35 can suppress several types of chronic inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease [26], and decreased the severity of collagen induced arthritis in animals. study was set to determine the IL-1 cytokine family (IL-1, IL-37) and IL-12 cytokine family (IL-12, IL-35) circulating levels of in patients infected with M. mycetomatis. this is correlation may help to understand the pathogenesis of mycetoma disease. all healthy controls were questioned for acute or chronic infectious diseases, autoimmune family history and genetic disorders. the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Khartoum, Sudan. one-way ANOVA was used for parametric data. a test with a p value 0.05 was considered statistically significant. written informed consent was taken from all participants before enrolment. healthy controls were selected from blood bank donors or healthy volunteers to match the patient\u2019s birthplace geographically. all healthy controls were questioned for acute or chronic infectious diseases, autoimmune family history and genetic disorders. the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Khartoum, Sudan. the study included 70 confirmed mycetoma patients and 70 healthy controls. the common age group was 19\u201324 years, 17 (22.9%) in the age group (25\u201329) years, and nine (12.9%) were 40 years old or more. control groups n = 70 (%) Mycetoma Patients n = 70 (%) Gender Female 14 (20) 14 (20%) Male 56 (80) 56 (80) Age groups (years) 12\u201318 9 (12.9) 9 (12.9) 19\u201324 22 (31.4) 22 (31.4) 25\u201329 16 (22.9) 16 (22.9) 30\u201339 14 (20.0) 14 (20.0) 40 9 (12.9) 9 (12.9) 9 (12.9) levels of cytokine IL-37 and IL-35 were constitutively positively correlated with IL-35 (Table 2). however, the levels of cytokine IL-37 and IL-35 were constitutively negatively correlated with IL-12 (Table 2). correlations between serum levels (IL-1, IL-37, IL-12 and IL-35) by the lesion diameter and the control group. levels of IL-1 showed a consistent positive correlation with IL-12. levels of IL-37 and IL-35 were constitutively negatively correlated with IL-12. but the levels of IL-37 and IL-35 were constitutively negatively correlated with IL-12. serum cytokine levels were determined in all mycetoma patients. circulating serum levels of IL-37 were significantly increased with lesion diameter. distribution of IL-1 levels has decreased dramatically with lesion diameter. IL-35 Control was significantly increased with increasing lesions\u2019 diameter. IL-1, IL-37, IL-12 and IL-35 were significantly increased. serum levels of IL-12 dramatically decreased with the increase in disease duration. circulating levels of IL-37 were positively increased with different durations of mycetoma infection compared to controls group.

M1 macrophages secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10 [61] and arginase 1, which inhibits NO production. presence of IL-37 in DCs impairs function in prime T cells and promotes their ability to induce Treg cells that produce IL-10. a unit increment in IL-1 decreases levels of IL-37 by 35.28 pg/ml. macrophages, Th1 and cytotoxic T-cells play an important role in the protective immunity against mycetoma infection. increased immunity found in mice lacking IL-35 is associated with a higher activation of macrophages and inflammatory T cells. IL-35 suppressed proliferation of antigen-specific CTLs and IFN- production. this finding is consistent with previous studies which reported that mycetoma mostly affects ages between 20 and 40 years-old. this finding is running parallel with the results of a previous study which showed that in a tertiary facility in Khartoum, the male to female ratio is 4:1. a previous study suggested that the dose of 10 g/ml itraconazole leads to strong inhibition of the cytokines IL-2, IL-4, IL-9 and IFN- and slight inhibition of TNF- cytokine production in PBMC. the levels of IL-37 and IL-35 were consistently positively correlated with different diameters of mycetoma lesions as well as its duration. more investigations are needed to explore the mechanism by which IL-35 and IL-37 contribute in the mycetoma infection outcomes. this will help in understanding the role of these cytokines in the pathogenesis of mycetoma and may exploit it as a potential therapeutic target to prevent mycetoma diseases recurrence."}
