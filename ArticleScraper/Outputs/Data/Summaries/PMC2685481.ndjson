{"summary": "the new tool is an important step towards simplified and standardized molecular diagnosis of Chagas disease. the new tool is an important step towards simplified and standardized molecular diagnosis of Chagas disease, the most important parasitic disease in the Americas. the T. cruzi species is genetically heterogeneous and has been classified in two major phylogenetic lineages, T. cruzi I and T. cruzi II. both lineages are associated with cardiac lesions in human infection, but digestive tract lesions only occur in infection with T. cruzi II. Xenodiagnosis is regularly used for parasite detection. results of this invasive test are only available after 1 to 3 months. PCR has been used to detect T. cruzi in the blood of chronic chagasic patients [9], in congenital transmission [10], in patient follow-up after treatment [11] and in disease reactivation after heart transplantation [12]. technique has already been developed for diagnosis of human trypanosomiasis [15], leishmaniasis [16], toxoplasmosis [17], schistosomiasis [18] and severe acute respiratory syndrome [19] technique has already been developed for diagnosis of human trypanosomiasis [15], leishmaniasis [16], toxoplasmosis [18] and severe acute respiratory syndrome. DNA concentrations were measured in the nanodrop ND-1000 UV-Vis spectrophotometer. the DNA was stored at 20\u00b0C. code, origin, host, and amount of DNA detected by the T. cruzi OligoC-TesT.

The IC line and migration control lines determine whether the T. cruzi OligoC test is valid or invalid. an invisible migration control line indicates an invalid detection step, while an invalid PCR reaction is indicated by a negative IC line in combination with a negative test line. the latter may happen due to inhibitory factors in the extracted DNA. T. cruzi and IC amplicons are visualized by their respective detection probes (7). the excess of detection probes migrate further and hybridise on the complementary probes coated at both sides of the dipstick as a control for migration. DNA from 25 different Trypanosoma rangeli isolates and from Leishmania donovani, Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Schistosoma mansoni and Plasmodium falciparum was obtained from other research groups. code, origin, host, and amount of DNA detected by the T. cruzi OligoC-TesT of 25 different isolates. blood samples from Chagas non-endemic and endemic controls DNA extracts from blood of 20 confirmed T. brucei gambiense infected persons from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), 20 confirmed L. donovani infected persons from Nepal and 20 confirmed P. falciparum infected persons from Zambia were obtained from the collection. 6 children (0\u201310 years old) and 27 adults (>18 years old) infected with T. cruzi were collected in Chile between the years 2000 and 2004. the blood was mixed with an equal volume of 6 M guanidine-HCl and 0.2 M EDTA, and 200 l was subjected to DNA extraction. rum infected persons from Zambia were obtained from the collection of the ITMA. blood samples from 48 Chagas endemic control persons were obtained from the blood bank of the Clinical Hospital, University of Chile in 2004. all animals were classified as infected with T. cruzi based on positive results in kDNA PCR followed by Southern blot hybridization [22]. DNA extraction DNA from T. cruzi Y culture was extracted with the QIAamp DNA mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). intestinal content of the vectors was mixed with 200 l PBS, boiled for 10 minutes and centrifuged at 10,000 g. anti-sense primer Tc-Sat-R was biotinylated at the 5\u2032 end. internal control DNA The internal control (IC) DNA sequence (81 bp) is identical to the target sequence except for a 20 bp central part. the IC central sequence was designed with the same length and the same GC content as the T. cruzi central sequence. internal control DNA sequence (81 bp) is identical to the target sequence. the IC central sequence was designed with the same length and the same GC content as the central sequence. detection probes were conjugated with gold particles using the procedure described in patent WO 2004/099438A1 [14] the IC line and migration control lines determine whether the T. cruzi OligoC test is valid or invalid. an invisible migration control line indicates an invalid detection step, while an invalid PCR reaction is indicated by a negative IC line in combination with a negative test line. the solution takes up the gold-labelled () detection probes. the IC detection probes (6) at the control side hybridise with their respective amplicons. the biotinylated PCR products accumulate on the neutralite avidin lines at both sides of the dipstick. PCR reaction is indicated by a negative IC line in combination with a negative test line. the latter may happen due to inhibitory factors in the extracted DNA. the test result is considered a valid positive result. the excess of detection probes migrate further and hybridise on the complementary probes coated at both sides of the dipstick as a control for migration (9). the PCR product is denaturated at 94\u00b0C for 30 seconds and transferred immediately to ice. dipsticks 1\u201310: 1 ng, 100 pg, 10 pg, 1 pg, 100 fg, 10 fg, 1 fg, 0.1 fg, 0.01 fg and 0 fg per assay. test results on serial dilution of T. cruzi epimastigotes in nave human blood. the specificity of the assay on 60 Chagas non-endemic and 48 endemic control blood samples was 100% with a 95% confidence interval [CI] scored by Wilson's method of 96.6% to 100%. the diagnostic accuracy of the T. cruzi OligoC-TesT was tested in 2007 on biological samples from 6 children and 27 infected adults, 2 infected adults, 2 infected O. degus rodents, 5 infected A. alivaceus rodents and 14 infected M. spinolai bugs. the test showed a sensitivity of 66.7% (95% CI: 30%\u201390.3%), 100% (87.5%\u2013100%), 100% the upper and lower line are the migration control and the T. cruzi test line respectively. dipsticks 1\u201310: 1 ng, 100 pg, 10 pg, 1 pg, 100 fg, 10 fg, 1 fg, 0.1 fg, 0.01 fg and 0 fg per assay. tenfold serial dilutions of purified DNA from 25 different T. rangeli isolates were tested. four isolates could be detected at a DNA concentration of 10 pg per assay, 13 at a DNA concentration of 100 pg or 1 ng. 8 isolates remained negative when tested at 1 ng DNA per assay. infected animals (Chile) Octodon degus 2 2 100% (34.2%\u2013100%) Abrothrix olivaceus 5 5 100% (56.6%\u2013100%) Infected vectors (Chile) Mepraia spinolai 14 14 100% (78.5%\u2013100%) Note: # number of samples. 95% CI 95% confidence interval (by Wilson's method). Xenodiagnosis is cumbersome, time consuming and invasive. despite the major advantages, PCR is still restricted to research applications. despite the major advantages, PCR is still restricted to research applications. the lower sensitivity on T. cruzi lineage I is probably due to the lower copy number of the satellite repeats in lineage I. this is confirmed by the fact that Diaz et al. also observed a lower sensitivity of their primers on DNA from T. rangeli strains. the specificity of the T. cruzi OligoC-TesT was estimated at 100% on blood samples from 60 Chagas non-endemic and 48 endemic control persons. the high sensitivity on blood samples from adults is encouraging given the general low parasitaemia in the blood of such patients. new tool is a first step towards low-tech and user-friendly molecular diagnostics for T. cruzi detection. presentation of the T. cruzi OligoC-TesT as a self-containing kit offers excellent prospects for PCR standardization. cruzi detection in biological samples bears clear potential as a simplified molecular diagnostic tool for Chagas disease."}
