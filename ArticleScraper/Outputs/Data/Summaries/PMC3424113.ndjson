{"summary": "a progressive pneumonia occurs in broilers and laying hens the first day after hatching. this disease occursrs the first day after hatching and lasts more than 30 days. the disease occursrs the first day after hatching and lasts more than 30 days. ornithobacterium rhinotracheale causes respiratory infections, such as airsacculitis and pneumonia, in birds all over the world. the pathogen can be a primary or secondary etiological agent, depending on the strain virulence, environmental factors, the immune status of the host, and the presence of other infectious agents. a total of 291,000 chickens from 8 intensive farms in 5 provinces of china were evaluated, including 70,000 affected breeding broilers, 100,000 affected breeding layers, 95,000 broilers with pneumonia and 16,000 affected layers. in total, 193 serum samples were collected for the detection of antibodies against ORT using a commercial testing kit. the positive colonies were identified by Gram stain and biochemical assays. the biochemical tests assayed for oxidase, catalase, lysine, urea, indole, sulphuric acid (H2S), nitrate, gelatinase, motility, and carbohydrate fermentations. RNA was extracted from the allantoic fluid using the QIAamp viral RNA mini kit. RT-PCR was performed in a 50 l reaction mixture containing 10 l of 5 reaction buffer, 1 l of mixed dNTPs. esis in a 1% (w/v) agarose gel was designated by H9N2/species/location/time. the positive colonies were grown in bouillon medium for 48 h at 37\u00b0C. group 4 birds were inoculated intraperitoneally with 10 LD50 of ORT/chicken/Shandong/2011. group 5 was administered 100 LD50 of H9N2/chicken/Shandong/2011 intranasally. a total of 291,000 chickens from 8 intensive farms in 5 provinces of china were evaluated. the samples originated from Liaoning, Inner Mongolia, Hebei, Shandong and Beijing. the samples were tested for the presence of ORT antibodies using the FLOCKCHEK* Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale Antibody Test Kit (IDEXX GmbH, Switzerland) easy Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Germany) was designed based on the available gene sequence. the forward primer was 5\u2032- GAG AAT TTT ACG GAT TAA G-3\u2032. reverse primer was 5\u2032-TTC GCT TGG TCT CCG AAG AT-3\u2032. RT-PCR was performed in a 50 l reaction mixture containing 10 l of 5 reaction buffer, 1 l of mixed dNTPs, 1 l of AMV enzyme, 2 l of each primer, 4 l of the RNA template, 2.5 l of DTT, and 27.5 l of distilled water. the PCR products were subject to electrophoresis in a 1% (w/v) agarose gel and sequenced. the chickens were infected intraperitoneally with different dilutions of ORT/chicken/Shandong/2011 in 0.5 ml. each group was observed daily for 14 days, and the LD50 was determined using the Reed-Muench method. group 4 birds were inoculated intraperitoneally with 100 ELD50 of ORT/chicken/Shandong/2011. group 5 was administered 100 ELD50 of H9N2/chicken/Shandong/2011 intranasally. each group was observed daily, and all were sacrificed on day 14 PI. ORT strain was successfully isolated from the lungs of diseased broilers by single colony purification. the colony formed by ORT/chicken/Shandong/2011 was circular and small in size (1\u20133 mm in diameter), opaque to grey in colour and non-haemolytic in sheep blood agar. the allantoic fluid of the inoculated embryos was positive by HA. RT-PCR yielded 468-bp amplicons. the sequence was 98%-100% homologous with H9N2 viruses. /chicken/Shandong/2011 was determined to be 1.43 108 cfu/ml in broilers. the ELD50 of the ORT/chicken/Shandong/2011 isolate was 107.83/ml. the survival rate was 30%, 20% and the chickens died between days 3 and 5 PI. infected birds inoculated with H9N2 virus followed by ORT or the H9N2 virus alone displayed typical pneumonia for 4 days. survival rate was up to 70%, compared to 90% in the H9N2 group. group 4 birds were inoculated intraperitoneally with 10 LD50 of ORT/chicken/Shandong/2011in 0.2 ml. group 5 chickens were given 100 ELD50 of H9N2/chicken/Shandong/2011in 0.2 ml. group 6 birds received the sterile physiological saline intraperitoneally as a negative controlin 0.5 ml. the strain was named ORT/chicken/Shandong/2011. the colony formed by ORT was circular and small in size (1\u20133 mm in diameter), opaque to grey in colour and non-haemolytic in sheep blood agar. the isolate was found to be Gram negative and multi-form upon microscopic inspection. ase - - Sucrose - - Glucose + + Galactose + + Maltose + + Fructose + + H9N2/chicken/Shandong/2011 identification The allantoic fluid of the inoculated embryos was positive by HA after the second passage of the virus in the SPF chicken embryos. RT-PCR yielded 468-bp amplicons. mortality Mortality Mortality (%) 1 10 0.5 2.49 109 cfu/ml 10 10/10 2 10 0.5 2.49 108 cfu/ml 6 6/10 3 10 0.5 2.49 107 cfu/ml 1 1/10 4 10 0.5 2.49 106 cfu/ml 0 0/10 5 10 0.5 2.49 105 cfu/ml 0 0/10 5 10 0.5 2.49 105 cfu the infected chickens died quickly after inoculation with ORT alone. the survival rate was up to 70%, compared to 90% in the H9N2 group. 4 birds were inoculated intraperitoneally with 10 LD50 of ORT/chicken/Shandong/2011in 0.5 ml. group 6 birds received the sterile physiological saline intraperitoneally as a negative controlin 0.5 ml. the findings are different from previous reports in which no pneumonia or airsacculitis was induced by aerosol, intra-tracheal or intra-thoracic inoculation with ORT alone. only intravenous inoculation has been reported to induce clinical signs in SPF chickens, with at least 20% mortality. it is generally acknowledged that ORT and Avian pneumovirusvirus infections synergistically aggravate respiratory symptoms in turkeys. the clinical signs and respiratory lesions observed during necropsy of birds infected with the H9N2+ORT combination confirm that ORT triggers the overt respiratory symptoms. however, co-infection of ORT could not reproduce the typical pathology of the pneumonia and airsacculitis, such as clots of fibrin in the air sacs. this is the first report of co-infection of broilers with ORT and H9N2 AIV. this co-infection might be associated with the outbreak of broiler airsacculitis in china."}
