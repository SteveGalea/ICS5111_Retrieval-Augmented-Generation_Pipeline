{"summary": "NS1 protein participates in multiple protein-RNA and protein-protein interactions to perform a plethora of functions. NS1 itself is relatively short (only 230 amino-acids) however, protein multifunctionality may be key feature of many small RNA virus replication strategies. BD and ED can homodimerize in solution [26], [28], [29], [30], and both contribute to functional NS1 multimerization during infection [21], [22]. Nevertheless, within the crystal lattice, the EDs formed homotypic contacts with neighboring molecules, thereby confirming that higher-order oligomeric forms of NS1 may occur [27]. NS1 monomers are colored green or wheat, and cellular proteins are colored red. isolated NS1 RBDs of several different influenza A virus isolates show a very high degree of structural homology and conservation. the helix-helix ED dimer is conserved among all NS1 ED structures. the helix-helix ED dimer interface is conserved among all NS1 ED structures. the favored dimerization interface of the NS1 ED remains controversial. EDs of the divergent human influenza A virus PR8 and avian influenza A virus Alb/76 were expressed and purified from bacteria. the purified EDs were screened for new conditions under which crystallization may occur in addition to those previously characterized. 2.50 (2.54\u20132.50) 2.20 (2.24\u20132.20) 3.20 (3.31\u20133.20) 2.90 (2.95\u20132.90) 2.50 (2.54\u20132.50) 2.00 (2.03\u20132.00) Rsym (%)* 8.5 (41.6) 4.2 (48.4) 10.2 (59.3) 12.4 (55.3) 4.9 (47.2) 6.2 (32.1) I/I * 28.5 (4.3) 30.0 (2.9) 14.8 (2.8) 19.3 helix-helix dimer is present in all known apo ED crystal structures. helix-helix dimer is present in all known apo ED crystal structures. dimers 3O9T_AA, 3L4Q_AC and 3F5T_AA are excluded from bioinformatic analyses. this is particularly pertinent for the PR8 NS1 ED which may be predisposed to form the strand-strand dimer in crystal lattices. gel filtration of the purified recombinant protein confirmed that PR8 ED-W187A is likely to be monomeric as compared with the WT ED dimer. no other alternative dimer conformation (including the strand-strand dimer) forms in solution in the absence of W187. the protein formed large hexagonal crystals belonging to spacegroup P3221 (PDB ID 3O9Q) however, when the same protein preparation was used for crystallization 6 months later the protein formed long needle-shaped crystals, which belonged to spacegroup P212121 (PDB ID 3O9R) in both crystal forms two ED-W187A monomers were observed in the asymmetric unit. helix-helix dimer interface disrupts the helix-helix interface. mutation disrupts the helix-helix interface resulting in a monomeric NS1 ED phenotype. however, PR8 NS1 inherently lacks this function [2]. both NS1 constructs expressed to similar levels as determined by western blot analysis of assay lysates. dilution of each NS1 plasmid resulted in a similar dose-response of NS1-mediated IFN-antagonism. formation of the NS1 ED helix-helix dimer has limited impact on the ability of the NS1 ED helix-helix dimer interface. Western blot analysis of lysates from (A) was set to 100%. NS1 and actin were detected using rabbit polyclonal antibodies. kDa is indicated to the right. the NS1 ED helix-helix dimer interface is shared by all structures of the NS1 ED. this suggests an inherent flexibility to the helix-helix interaction. this suggests an inherent flexibility to the helix-helix interaction. the NS1 ED forms a flexible dimer via the helix-helix interface. helix-helix interface bears several characteristics reminiscent of transient dimers capable of associating and dissociating [41], [42], [43] the ED helix-helix dimer interfaces have a mean LD of 35.54.7. similar analyses of isolated NS1 ED helix-helix dimer characteristics confirm that this interaction is even weaker than the helix-helix dimer. 23 3O9T_AA symmetric 551 8.48 2.36 37.8 2197 1.99 3O9T_BB symmetric 551 7.9 2.64 39.1 3854 3.50 Alb/76 3D6R_AB asymmetric 698 10.9 2.39 39.7 3247 2.33 3OA9_AB asymmetric 587 9.3 2.42 39.7 2447 2.08 Ud/72 3EE8_AA symmetric 436 6.4 2.46 30.3 2687 3.08 3 symmetric dimer 3O9T_AAED() is excluded from calculation of mean and standard deviation due to the presence of a molecule of PEG2000 at the helix-helix dimer interface. it is part of a full-length NS1 ED strand-strand dimer structure. the gap volume index is much lower (1.620.23 ) and planarity much higher (3.790.31 ). the size of the domain is likely more influenced by the size of the domain. however, examination of the interface surface area as a percentage of total surface area indicates that a relatively high proportion of the protein surface is involved in the interaction.

PR8 NS1 is thought to antagonize IFN promoter activation (at least in part) by binding to cellular TRIM25, thereby preventing ubiquitination of the viral RNA sensor, RIG-I [3]. the interaction of NS1 with TRIM25 requires both the NS1 RBD and ED [3], although the necessary dimeric state of the ED is unknown. 293T cells were co-transfected for 16 h with a pCAGGS expression plasmid encoding the indicated PR8 NS1 protein (or vector only), a FF-Luc IFN-promoter reporter plasmid (p125Luc), and a constitutively active REN-Luc reporter plasmid (pRL-TK) after infection with SeV for a further 12 h, both activities were determined. NS1 ED dimerization may have biological implications for PR8 NS1 functions that require strong RNA-binding, such as antagonism of 2\u2019-5\u2019 OAS/RNaseL [7] but not for some other functions (e.g. potential direct binding to TRIM25 [3]). the arrangement of the two ED monomers differs markedly relative to one another. this suggests an inherent flexibility to the helix-helix interaction, rather than a function of specific amino acid differences. this suggests an inherent flexibility to the helix-helix interaction, rather than a function of specific amino acid differences. the helix-helix dimer interface has several characteristics reminiscent of transient dimers capable of associating and dissociating [41], [42], [43] the helix-helix dimer interface bears several characteristics reminiscent of transient dimers capable of associating and dissociating.

PR8 dimer 2ZKO_AB is excluded from calculation of mean and standard deviation as it is in complex with a molecule of dsRNA. the symmetric dimer is formed by chain A of the full-length NS1 structure 3F5T. mAb 1A7 recognizes a linear epitope that absolutely requires W187. mAb 1A7 would be unable to recognize the helix-helix ED dimer if this conformation actually exists. mAb 1A7 was not included in the calculations as it is part of a full-length NS1 structure. MDCK cells were infected with rPR8 virus at an MOI of 2 PFU/cell. use of the PR8 strain prevented confounding issues regarding CPSF30 binding. pAb 155 highlighted both nuclear and cytoplasmic NS1 at 8 and 12 h post-infection, but mAb 1A7 predominantly recognized only nuclear NS1 at these timepoints. at 24 h post-infection, mAb 1A7 can recognize both nuclear and cytoplasmic NS1 in a manner similar to pAb 155. we speculate that the cytoplasmic NS1 at this timepoint adopts a different conformation than the cytoplasmic NS1 at 8 and 12 h. indirect immunofluorescence analysis of NS1 protein localization was performed using rabbit anti-NS1 pAb 155 and mouse mAb 1A7. bar graphs represent the mean nuclear/cytoplasmic (N/C) ratios of mean fluorescent intensities derived from manually assigned nuclei and cytoplasms. hypothetical model of NS1 ED transient homotypic interactions. mAb 1A7 only recognizes NS1 when W187 is exposed. some functions potentially associated with each conformer are listed. a previous study proposed a multimeric state of NS1 composed of extensive repeating chains of \u2018domain-swapped dimers\u2019. the chains were noted in a crystal lattice of full-length VN/04 NS1. the precise role, if any, of such filaments is unknown. NS1:CPSF30 binding site on NS1 overlaps extensively with the ED helix-helix dimer interface [28], [33], indicating that the affinity of NS1 for CPSF30 is much higher than that of its homotypic interaction. NS1 activates host cytoplasmic PI3K signaling at mid-times post-infection, when suppression of host-cell gene expression may be most critical. NS1-mediated activation of PI3K is a catalytic process, thus requiring few NS1 molecules. CPSF30 inhibition requires stoichiometric sequestration by many NS1 molecules. a key aspect of our functional model is the instability and flexibility of the NS1 ED helix-helix dimer. a previous report found that the Ud/72 NS1 ED requires concentrations in excess of 0.3 mM (approximately 5 mg/mL) for dimerization to occur. at 0.06 mM (approximately 1 mg/mL) the purified Ud/72 NS1 ED is predominantly monomeric. however, at this same concentration we routinely observe complete dimerization of the PR8 and Alb/76 NS1 EDs. the pRSFDuet-1 plasmid expressing a 6His-tagged version of the Alb/76 NS1 ED (residues 73\u2013230) has been described previously [28] the same cloning strategy was used to generate a plasmid for expression of a 6His-tagged version of the PR8 NS1 ED. the reservoir solution was 0.1 M HEPES [pH 6.5], 0.1 M NaCl, 20% PEG 4K, 10% isopropanol, 10% glycerol. data were collected on an in-house rotating anode (RA Micro7 HFM) and a Saturn944 CCD. the rabbit polyclonal NS1 anti-serum raised against a GST-NS1 (RBD) fusion protein was used previously. the anti-NS1 hybridoma (mAb clone 1A7) was a generous gift from Jonathan Yewdell. rPR8 (wild-type, WT) was rescued according to a previously reported protocol [15], albeit using PR8 RNA expression plasmids. 293T cells in 12-well plates were transfected with 25 ng of p125Luc, 25 ng of pRL-TK. after 16 h, the cells were infected with approximately 1 PFU/cell of SeV. proteins were detected by western blot techniques following transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. cells were seeded onto glass-bottomed 12-well culture plates and transfected (1 g plasmid per well) or infected (2 PFU/cell) at indicated times, cells were fixed and permeabilized with ice-cold methanol for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. changes encoding the W187A mutation into the PR8 NS1 ED cDNA. the identity of each construct was confirmed by commercial DNA sequencing. structures were solved by molecular replacement using PHASER. bioinformatic analyses domain interface characterization was performed using a dataset comprised of novel NS1 structures and coordinates from the PDB database. structures of full-length NS1 or domains in complex with other molecules (e.g. dsRNA or p85) were excluded from the dataset. mammalian cells and antibodies 293T and MDCK cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, VA, USA) site-directed point mutations into the NS1-encoding cDNA. all NS1-encoding cDNAs contained silent mutations in the splice acceptor site. identity of each new construct was confirmed by commercial DNA sequencing. poly(rI):poly(rC)-Sepharose pull-downs, SDS-PAGE and western blot poly(rI):poly(rC)-Sepharose pull-downs were performed as described [15], albeit using transiently-expressed (293T) PR8 NS1-V5 proteins as bait. proteins were detected by standard western blot techniques following transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride (PV secondary antibodies (goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 633 or goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488, Invitrogen, USA) were incubated with the samples at a 11000 dilution before fluorescence imaging."}
