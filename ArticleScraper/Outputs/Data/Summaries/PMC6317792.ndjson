{"summary": "ARIs are associated with cluster of differentiation (CD)8+ T cells. these cells exhibit diminished production of cytokines and cytotoxic molecules. this is a unique feature of viral ARI because T-cell dysfunction occurs in chronic. T-cell impairment occurs when virus-specific CD8+ T cells fail to produce inflammatory cytokines or perform cytotoxic functions at the site of infection. the same virus-specific cells at other sites, such as the spleen, are completely functional. a significant portion of lung injury after serious infections is due to immunopathology rather than to the virus infecting and killing cells. a significant portion of lung injury after serious infections is due to immunopathology rather than to the virus infecting and killing cells. PD-1 signaling alters metabolism, diverts metabolic pathways away from glycolysis and towards fatty acid oxidation. PD-1 is up-regulated by antigen stimulation, while inhibitory ligands are induced by interferons. blockade of PD-L1 or genetic depletion of PD-1 increases the functionality of virus-specific CD8+ T cells. PD-1 appears to be the dominant inhibitory receptor for ARI [14]. blockade of lag-3 increases immunopathology without reducing viral titer. many of the same inhibitory receptors have been implicated in both impairment and exhaustion. there are subsets of exhausted T cells that can be rescued by anti-PD-1 blockade or that remain terminally differentiated and unresponsive to PD-1 blockade. it is not yet known whether similar subsets of impaired T cells exist in the lung. it is important to consider lung T-cell impairment when developing vaccines. rare but serious side effect of checkpoint inhibitors is pneumonitis. a future improvement to checkpoint therapy would be the ability to specifically target tumor-specific T cells. a future improvement would be the ability to specifically target tumor-specific T cells."}
