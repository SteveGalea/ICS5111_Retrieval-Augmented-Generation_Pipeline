{"summary": "the 2014-2015 seasonal influenza vaccine contained the A(H1N1)pdm09-like antigen. the vaccine decreases the incidence of influenza and the risk of more serious influenza-related complications (1,2) the severe cough followed by musculoskeletal chest pain precluded pulmonary function tests. 65% lymphocytes, 15% eosinophils, 19% macrophages, and 1% neutrophils. the CD4+/CD8+ ratio was 2.1. oral steroid therapy was tapered on an outpatient basis. 10 months after the treatment, her prednisolone dose was tapered. the patient remains healthy with no further symptoms or radiographic abnormalities. severe cough precluded carrying out pulmonary function tests. BALF examination revealed 49.3% lymphocytes, 15.5% eosinophils, 34.2% macrophages, and 1% neutrophils, without infectious organisms or malignant cells. a 71-year-old woman presented with severe, dry cough and left chest pain. her medical history revealed well-controlled diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia. she underwent right nephrectomy for renal tuberculosis 37 years ago. the severe cough followed by musculoskeletal chest pain precluded pulmonary function tests. 65% lymphocytes, 15% eosinophils, 19% macrophages, and 1% neutrophils, with no infectious organisms or malignant cells. oral steroid therapy was tapered on an outpatient basis. 10 months after the treatment, her prednisolone dose was tapered. the patient remains healthy with no further symptoms or radiographic abnormalities. severe cough precluded carrying out pulmonary function tests. BALF examination revealed 49.3% lymphocytes, 15.5% eosinophils, 34.2% macrophages, and 1% neutrophils, without infectious organisms or malignant cells. oral steroid therapy was tapered off 30 months after treatment. the patient remains healthy with no further symptoms or radiographic abnormalities. he did not get the annual influenza vaccine the following year. atoid factor, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative for current infection of Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae and psittaci, and Legionella pneumophila. no pathogen was detected from the BALF by culture of general bacteria, acid-fast bacteria, and fungi. interstitial pneumonia is a rare complication of the influenza vaccine. three were associated with a vaccine without the A(H1N1)pdm09-like antigen (6-8) and six with a monovalent influenza A(H1N1)pdm09-like antigen (9-12) eight patients exhibited fever and some respiratory symptoms, including cough or dyspnea on exertion. three patients-one pregnant woman and two with pre-existing interstitial pneumonia-required mechanical ventilation support. all nine patients survived, indicating a good prognosis. this may be due to racial differences in the risk of drug-induced lung injury. reports are required for accumulating knowledge about interstitial pneumonia associated with the influenza vaccine. findings suggest clinicians should be aware of the possibility of interstitial pneumonia as a complication of the influenza vaccine. authors state that they have no conflict of interest (COI)."}
