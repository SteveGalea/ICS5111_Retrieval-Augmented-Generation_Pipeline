{"summary": "more than 90% of these structures have been determined by X-ray crystallography (PDB July 2014) these include structural proteins forming icosahedral capsids and other components of virus particles. unless the nucleic acid enters alone, viral genome replication and expression will require uncoating of the capsid. X-ray and cryo-electron micrography structures of different HRV2 uncoating intermediates revealed structural alterations that take place in the virus architecture. the acidic pH induces the conversion of the native HRV2 virions into an expanded, porous uncoating intermediate called an A-particle. similar uncoating mechanisms have also been described for PV. fusion of viral and cell membranes may occur either at the cell surface or after internalization of the virus particle. the process is driven by specialized viral glycoproteins, called fusogens, which are in metastable conformations in the virus particle. the free energy liberated during the transition from the metastable pre-fusion to the highly stable post-fusion conformation drives the fusion process. tail-less coliphage X174 requires the tubular structure of DNA pilot protein H to be wide enough to allow the passage of two antiparallel strands of ssDNA. this tube acts as a tail for the translocation of the viral genome, but it protrudes from the virion only at the time of infection. plant viruses do not enter their hosts via receptor-mediated endocytosis because of the cell-wall barrier. studies on mice using CPMV and cowpea chrorotic mottle virus (CCMV) showed that both viruses entered different tissues. CPMV particles largely accumulated in the liver and spleen. CCMV was mostly found in the thyroid gland. the first contact is mediated by adhesion receptors that allow reversible attachment of the virus to particular cells or organs. this initial interaction could lack specificity and is employed to enhance the encounter between virus and entry receptors, which irreversibly bind the virus. most viruses establish contacts with cellular receptors which could be sialic acid bound molecules or proteins on the cell surface. the sialic acid binding pocket of HA1 is formed by a loop\u2013helix\u2013loop structure composed of the 130-loop, 190-helix and 220-loop. a ribbon representation of an HA1 trimer is shown in the upper part. a repertoire of crystal structures of HA\u2013receptor complexes from different influenza outbreaks has recently been reported. high-resolution X-ray structures have shown how the point mutation Asp225 to Asn diminishes the specific HA\u2013receptor interactions. a single substitution (Gln to Leu) promotes binding to the human receptor to the detriment of the avian receptor. complex between MV-H and SLAM has also been determined. nectin-4 binds to MV-H by means of its N-terminal domain. these high-resolution structures illustrate the variability of interactions important for MV infection. et al. determined the structure of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in complex with its cellular receptor, the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) this receptor does not resemble any other CoV receptor in either sequence or structure. the MERS-CoV RBD appears to be different from the SARS-CoV reported earlier (Li et al., 2005 ). resulting C-terminal fragment bears a hydrophobic fusion peptide at or near its amino-terminal end that is buried at a protein\u2013protein interface in the pre-fusion state. the shape of the trimeric molecule resembles an elongated hairpin-like structure with the fusion peptide and the TM domain located at the same end. class II proteins had only been found in flaviviruses (protein E) and alphaviruses (protein E1), which share many key characteristics. similar structures are now available for the ectodomain of denguevirus types 2 and 3. flaviviruses forming unusual non-equivalent icosahedral assemblies. crystal structures of the glycoprotein C (Gc) from RVFV reveal a class II fusion protein fold. the structure of RVFV Gc is strikingly similar to flaviviruses. class III proteins are trimeric before and after fusion and share structural characteristics with both class I and class II fusion glycoproteins. a class III fold was identified in the structures of the ectodomains of the fusion glycoproteins G of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and B (gB) of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1). domain moves upwards by flipping relative to the central helix. this is followed by the reversal of the molecule around the central rigid block. it is likely that the transition of VSV G from the pre-fusion to the post-fusion conformation involves disassembly of the trimer into the monomers. in both cases, membrane merger results from trans-oligomerization of molecules anchored in the opposed membranes, followed by a conformational change that pulls the two membranes towards each other. cell\u2013cell fusion entails the same set of fusion proteins in the two membranes. bacteriophages Bacteriophages show widely diverse structures and types of nucleic acid genomes. they have helical or icosahedral capsids and may not include a lipid envelope. tail tip complex has different size and morphology in different phages. phages using polysaccharide receptors usually have elaborate baseplates at the distal end of the tail. phages usually have side-tail fibres or spikes attached to the periphery of the tail tip complex. phages usually have side-tail fibres or spikes, attached to the periphery of the tail tip complex, as well as a central tail spike. most extensively studied Myoviridae baseplate is that of phage T4, composed of 140 polypeptide chains of at least 16 different proteins. structures of nine baseplate proteins have been determined using cryo-electron microscopy. the central part of the baseplate is formed by a circular hexamer of ORF15 proteins with a central hole. a trimer of ORF16 is located at the bottom of the baseplate, forming a closed dome that does not allow DNA passage. X174 is a small icosahedral microvirus with a circular ss(DNA) the virus capsid has spikes on all pentameric vertices. each of the 12 spikes consists of five G proteins. a 170 -long -helical tube consists of a 170 -long -helical tube built from ten -helices. each monomer is kinked at approximately the middle of the molecule. the tube has its amino termini arranged in a right-handed super-helical coiled coil. the closed-hand conformation is accomplished by interconnecting the fingers and thumb domains through the N-terminal portion of the protein and several loops protruding from fingers, named the fingertips, that completely encircle the active site of the enzyme. the only exception to this scheme is found in Birnavirus and Permutatetravirus polymerases, where motif C is encoded upstream of motif A. the seven conserved motifs are indicated in different colours: motif A, red; motif B, green; motif C, yellow; motif D, purple; motif E, cyan; motif F, blue; motif G, pink. the side chains of the catalytic Asp residues in the active site are also shown as sticks. the members of the Picornaviridae and Caliciviridae families use exclusively the protein-primed mechanism of initiation. in this process, a tyrosine residue provides the hydroxyl group for the formation of a phosphodiester bond with the first nucleotide. the foot-and-mouth disease virus VPg protein lines the RNA-binding cleft of the corresponding RdRP. enzymes using the de novo initiation, Reovirus and Flavivirus RdRPs, contain additional structural elements that fill most of the active-site cavity. these protrusions are also able to undergo large conformational rearrangements to facilitate translocation of the RNA recently synthesized. binding of the correct nucleotide then induces the realignment of -strands in the palm subdomain that includes structural motifs A and C. recent data suggest that a conserved lysine residue within motif D can coordinate the export of the inorganic phosphate group from the active site. NV RdRP exhibits two other key changes: a rotation of the central helix in the thumb domain by 22\u00b0, resulting in the formation of a binding pocket for the primer RNA strand. a displacement of the C-terminal tail region away from the central active-site groove. inactive RdRPs can induce stimulation of activity and participate in array formation. viral proteases In most single-stranded RNA viruses, some double-stranded RNA viruses and retroviruses with polycistronic genomes, various functional protein domains are initially expressed as a single polyprotein. the number of proteases is as large as 93 of which 60 are structures with bound ligands. cleavage at a specific site of the polyprotein depends on the sequence on either side of the cleavable bond. the conformation and accessibility of the peptide bond also contribute to the susceptibility to cleavage. each susceptible site in a polyprotein may have a different cleavage profile. galovirus family have a catalytic triad of histidine, histidine and serine. the aspartic protease of HIV is also different compared to the cellular aspartic proteases in that it functions as an obligate dimer. the catalytic function of viral proteases has been found to be regulated by other domains that may be attached covalently to the N- or C-terminus of the protease. NS2A and NS4A act as cofactors for regulation of activity of the NS3 proteases of dengue virus and hepatitis C virus. poliovirus 3CD precursor, which consists of the protease domain 3Cpro and the polymerase domain 3Dpol, exhibits protease activity similar to 3Cpro. polymerase is active only as 3Dpol after the elimination of the 3Cpro domain. proteases of the alphaviruses have a compact structure. RNA-binding motifs are observed with many viral proteases of RNA viruses. viral proteases also appear to be involved in shutting down of host-cell translation by acting upon integral components of the host translation machinery. combination with new experimental approaches, such as high-resolution electron microscopy and single-molecule techniques. the advent of in situ diffraction and X-ray free-electron lasers will undoubtedly influence our research on structural virology."}
