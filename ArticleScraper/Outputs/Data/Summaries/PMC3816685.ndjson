{"summary": "introduction RNA interference (RNAi) is a natural endogenous mechanism for silencing gene expression. gene silencing can be induced by siRNAs through a sequence-specific cleavage of perfectly complementary messenger RNA (mRNA); in contrast, miRNAs mediate translational repression and transcript degradation for imperfectly complementary targets. RNAi-based therapy may provide several advantages over conventional therapeutic approaches using small molecules, proteins, and monoclonal antibodies. direct administration of RNAi-based therapeutics into the target organs is a promising approach for overcoming the problems of systemic administration. the lung is susceptible to many diseases because of its location and physiological function. delivery of siRNAs to the lungs is often studied and described using different routes and delivery strategies. the focus of this chapter is on the characteristics of siRNA delivery to the lung. the use of siRNAs for the treatment of respiratory diseases has tended to focus on direct intratracheal or intranasal delivery. intratracheal and intranasal delivery is one common method of pulmonary drug application. the pulmonary application method can be useful for the study of drug and vaccine delivery to the airway and lungs. many studies have relied on intratracheal delivery of siRNAs to the lungs. the method is being used in animal models to test and evaluate its reliability for possible clinical applications. intranasal delivery is another common method of pulmonary drug application in animal studies. intranasal application of unformulated siRNAs resulted in lower delivery efficiency and homogeneous pulmonary distribution than that achieved with intratracheal application. administration by inhalation is a popular and non-invasive method of delivering agents into the lungs. the use of DPIs has already shown promise for the in vivo delivery of therapeutic macromolecules such as insulin [39] and low-molecular-weight heparin [40]. the advantages of DPIs are improved stability and sterility of biomolecules over liquid aerosols and propellant-free formation. a particle size between 1\u20135 m is found to be the most appropriate for deposition at the lower respiratory tract. a particle size between 1\u20135 m is found to be the most appropriate for deposition at the lower respiratory tract. extracellular barriers to pulmonary delivery also depend on physiological features of the respiratory tract. clara cells and type II alveolar cells secrete on the surface of the alveolar epithelium, forming a thin layer of pulmonary surfactants. the surfactants act as the main barrier for siRNA delivery because they reduce the transfection efficiency. these factors present major barriers to targeted pulmonary delivery. siRNA carrier complex in endocytic vesicles is transported along microtubules to lysosomes that are co-localized with the microtubule-organizing center. endosomal escape is a major barrier for efficient siRNA delivery. both viral and non-viral vectors are being assessed for siRNA delivery to lung cells. some viral vectors, such as retroviruses and adenoviruses, have been demonstrated to mediate gene silencing in an in vitro lung model. many commercial siRNA transfection agents are lipid-based delivery system. cationic polymers have also been assessed for siRNA delivery to lung cells. lipid-based vectors can also induce toxicity and non-specific activation of inflammatory cytokine and interferon responses. a few of them reported that the use of delivery vectors showed no significant difference in gene silencing efficiency compared to that of naked siRNAs [16,35]. this successful evidence can be because naked siRNAs for clinical applications are highly chemically modified to prevent nuclease-induced degradation. both animal and human trials have been conducted successfully, showing the efficacy of naked siRNAs (ALN-RSV01) that were administered intranasally. administration by inhalation is clinically the most common and non-invasive method to deliver therapeutic agents into the lung. only a few animal studies have been conducted on the formulation of inhalation of siRNAs. pulmonary application method can be useful for the study of drug and vaccine delivery to the airway and lungs. the method is being used in animal models to test and evaluate its reliability for possible clinical applications. intranasal delivery is another common method of pulmonary drug application in animal studies. intranasal delivery is another common method of pulmonary drug application in animal studies. intranasal entry has long been used to administer small molecules, such as proteins, for systemic delivery. the intranasal method is suitable for some lung diseases, such as upper respiratory infection by RSV. it also has potential for systemic delivery rather than pulmonary delivery of siRNAs. the use of inhalable siRNAs has already shown promise for the in vivo delivery of therapeutic macromolecules such as insulin [39] and low-molecular-weight heparin [40]. the advantages of DPIs are improved stability and sterility of biomolecules over liquid aerosols and propellant-free formation. the trachea is exposed during the procedure, and an endotracheal tube or microsyringe is inserted through an incision between the tracheal rings. this method is not routinely used for drug administration in humans. intranasal delivery is another common method of pulmonary drug application in animal studies. in many studies, in vivo success has been demonstrated in delivering siRNAs intranasally to the lungs intranasally [22,35,36]. administration by inhalation is a popular and non-invasive method of delivering agents into the lungs. a spacer is attached to an MDI to allow for better drug delivery by enhanced actuation and inhalation coordination. studies using siRNAs have relied on intratracheal or intranasal delivery. the reason could be the difficulty in formulating inhalable siRNAs. a suitable carrier is also needed to protect nucleic acids from degradation due to shear force. macrophages present major barriers to targeted pulmonary delivery. extracellular barriers to siRNA delivery depend on physiological features of the respiratory tract. asthma and COPD are both chronic inflammatory conditions of the lung. for efficient gene silencing in the lungs, siRNAs must be delivered to their site of action, be stable, enter the target cells, and be present in the cytoplasm at sufficient concentration. for efficient endocytosis to occur, particles should be under 150 nm in size. for efficient endocytosis to occur, particles should be under 150 nm in size. endosomal entrapment and lysosomal degradation of siRNA and carriers contribute to low transfection efficiency. ideal delivery agent should protect siRNAs from enzymatic degradation, facilitate cellular uptake, and promote endosomal escape inside the cells with negligible toxicity. lentivirus-mediated siRNA was used to specifically knock down the expression of nuclear protein 1 (NUPR1) in vivo, which resulted in inhibited tumor growth. however, viral-based delivery has several disadvantages. recent well-documented cases highlight this problem. lipid-based vectors can also induce toxicity and non-specific activation of inflammatory cytokine and interferon responses. effective siRNA delivery to a local area in lung diseases requires more attention to the development of non-toxic delivery vectors. the term \"naked siRNAs\" refers to the delivery of siRNAs without any delivery vectors. RNAi Medicine in Lung Diseases Lung disease is a major cause of death, and diminished quality of life is responsible for the suffering of many patients. the high death rates associated with lung cancer are partly due to the fact that it is unfortunately difficult to cure. a number of siRNA-based therapies are being evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of different conditions, including lung diseases such as asthma and RSV infection. a number of siRNA-based therapies are being evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of different conditions.

RNAi-based therapy is an attractive strategy for the development of more effective anticancer therapies with reduced treatment-related toxicity. the major advantage of RNAi therapeutics in cancer might be the simultaneous targeting of multiple genes belonging to different cellular pathways that are involved in tumor progression. PKN3 is a downstream effector of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway. it regulates diverse cellular responses, including development, growth, and survival. PKN3 has also been considered as a suitable therapeutic target for modulating tumor angiogenesis. some studies have shown a large genetic contribution to the variability in pulmonary function and COPD [86,87] some studies have shown a large genetic contribution to the variability in pulmonary function and COPD [86,87] RNAi-based approach for key molecules also has potential implications for the treatment of COPD. asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways characterized by variable and recurring symptoms and reversible airflow obstruction. antisense oligonucleotides administered by aerosol were potent to decrease Syk expression and mediator release from alveolar macrophages. inhibition of inflammatory mediators was shown in a study using siRNA targeting Syk in airway epithelial cells. a miRNA-based therapy has already entered a phase II clinical trial. table 2 shows the summary of miRNAs in therapeutic development. miRNAs in inflammatory lung diseases. pulmonary fibrosis miR-21 [118] miR-155 [128] let-7d [119] miR-29 [120] miR-200 [121] smoking-related miRNA let-7 [129] miR-10a [129] miR-34 [129] miR-123 [129] miR-145 [117] miR-218 [130] miR-222 [117,129] pulmonary fibrosis can be caused by an identifiable irritation to the lungs. in many cases, the cause is unknown, and therapeutic possibilities are limited. miRNAs may play an important regulatory role in the pulmonary fibrotic change in the lungs. miRNA expression is linked to the development of inflammatory infiltration into the lung and airway remodeling. some studies present a functional connection between miRNA expression and asthma pathogenesis. miRNA-based therapy for inflammatory lung diseases are less advanced than those for lung cancer. miRNA mimics are synthetic RNA duplexes designed to mimic endogenous functions of miRNAs with chemical modifications for stability and cellular uptake. miRNA replacement therapy involves re-introduction of a tumor suppressor miRNA mimic to restore a loss of the function. miRNA replacement therapy is most exemplified by the let-7 miRNA. several in vivo studies failed to reveal side effects caused by miRNA mimics. it will be important to research miRNA mimic-induced effects in normal cells. it will be important to research miRNA mimic-induced effects in normal cells. miRNA mimics or antimiR with chemotherapy may potentiate the efficacy of the cancer treatment in the future. miRNAs related with cancer stem cells may significantly broaden the field of miRNA-based therapy. the main challenge is the successful delivery and chemical modifications of the therapeutic miRNAs to the target tissue without harming normal tissues. asal spray Naked siRNA RSV infection RSV nucleocapsid IIb Atu027 IV Lipid nanoparticles Hypercholesterolemia ApoB I TKM-PLK1 IV Lipid nanoparticles Cancer Polo-like-kinase1 I ALN-VSP02 IV Lipid nanoparticles Solid tumors with liver involvement KSP and VEGF I ALN-TTR01 IV Lipid nanoparticles Transthyretin-mediated amy RNAi-based therapy has shown promising effects in murine models of RSV infection. the siRNA, ALN-RSV01, is directed against the mRNA encoding the N-protein of RSV that exhibits specific in vitro and in vivo anti-RSV activity. it is delivered without a delivery vector as a nasal spray and targets the upper respiratory tract instead of the lower lung area. the administration of ALN-RSV01 to infected lung transplant patients was safe and well tolerated and associated with a statistically significant improvement in symptoms. a larger multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase IIb trial of ALN-RSV01 has been initiated in lung transplant patients to confirm and extend these findings. atu027, a siRNA-lipoplex targeted against protein kinase N3 (PKN3), prevented lung metastasis in a phase I trial of various cancer models. PKN3 is a downstream effector of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway [80], which regulates diverse cellular responses, including development, growth, and survival. many studies have investigated the role of cellular senescence in the development and progression of COPD. some medications, including inhaled corticosteroids, are used for COPD treatment. some studies have shown a large genetic contribution to the variability in pulmonary function and COPD [86,87] trials with siRNAs have never been performed in COPD. more research is needed to understand molecular mechanisms about the pathogenesis of COPD. no available treatments reduce the progression of COPD or suppress the inflammation in small airways and lung parenchyma. the genes that have been assessed as siRNA targets for the treatment of asthma are reported [101] in a clinical trial for asthma, ExcellairTM (ZaBeCor, Bala Cynwyd, PA, USA), a siRNA that targets Syk, is being used. the kinase is involved in signaling from a B cell receptor and is a key regulator of downstream signaling cascades that ultimately lead to the activation of several pro-inflammatory transcription factors. RNAi-based therapy has shown promising effects in murine models of RSV infection. the siRNA, ALN-RSV01, is directed against the mRNA encoding the N-protein of RSV that exhibits specific in vitro and in vivo anti-RSV activity. it is delivered without a delivery vector as a nasal spray and targets the upper respiratory tract instead of the lower lung area. RNAi-based therapy is an attractive strategy for the development of more effective anticancer therapies with reduced treatment-related toxicity. the major advantage of RNAi therapeutics in cancer might be simultaneous targeting of multiple genes belonging to different cellular pathways. the simultaneously inhibition of several genes would also minimize the risk of drug resistance normally encountered with small molecule-based therapies. atu027 can be considered as a potential therapeutic target for preventing lung metastasis combined with conventional cancer therapy. COPD is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways. this disease is hallmarked by airflow that is not fully reversible. polymorphisms in multiple genes have been reported to be associated with COPD [87], such as transcription factor [e.g. nuclear factor-kappa B (NFB)] [88], extracellular matrix [89,90], cytokines [e.g. tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-] [91], chemokines [e.g. interleukins (IL)-8, IL-8 receptor and chemokine receptor (CCR)1] [92,93 inhaled corticosteroids are very effective in mild asthma because they improve symptoms and decrease exacerbations. but in moderate and severe asthma, inhaled corticosteroids have important therapeutic limitations. many target genes have been identified that participate in the pathogenesis of asthma. siRNA targeting Syk seeks to inhibit an initial signaling step of inflammation and prevent the release of multiple inflammatory mediators. recent progress of siRNAs to the lungs has also improved the therapeutic feasibility of RNAi for inflammatory lung diseases. miRNA replacement let-7 Lung cancer Preclinical [106] miR-34 Lung cancer, Prostate cancer Preclinical [107,108] miR-29 Cardiac fibrosis Preclinical [109] miRNA antagonists miR-122 Hepatitis C virus II [110] miR-208/499 Chronic heart failure Preclinical [111] miR-15/195 Post-myocardial infarction remodeling Preclinical [114] miR-451 Myeloprol smoking is the main risk factor for the development of COPD. there are some reports about smoking-related miRNAs. pulmonary fibroblasts of COPD patients present less expression of miR-146a. the downregulation of let-7d in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) resulted in increased collagen deposition and alveolar septal thickening. miRNAs may play an important regulatory role in the pulmonary fibrotic change in the lungs. miRNA expression profiling in airway biopsies from patients with mild asthma revealed no differences in miRNA expression. applications of miRNA-based therapy for inflammatory lung diseases are less advanced than those for lung cancer [136] miRNA replacement therapy involves the re-introduction of a tumor suppressor miRNA mimic to restore a loss of the function. the concept of miRNA replacement therapy is most exemplified by the let-7 miRNA. let-7 mimic mimics mimic the endogenous functions of miRNAs with chemical modifications for stability and cellular uptake. antisense oligonucleotides are termed antagomirs or \u201cLNA-antimiRs\u201d [144,145] they are oligonucleotides with sequences complementary to the endogenous miRNA and inhibit the specific miRNA function. an LNA-antimiR against miR-122 has been shown to effectively silence miR-122 in non-human primates. combining miRNA mimics or antimiR with chemotherapy may potentiate the efficacy of the cancer treatment in the future. miRNAs related with cancer stem cells may significantly broaden the field of miRNA-based therapy. main challenge is the successful delivery and chemical modifications of the therapeutic miRNAs to the target tissue without harming normal tissues. smoking is the main risk factor for the development of COPD. there are some reports about smoking-related miRNAs. pulmonary fibrosis is a complex, multi-component, and heterogeneous disorder. miRNAs may play an important regulatory role in the pulmonary fibrotic change in the lungs. the downregulation of let-7d in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis resulted in increased collagen deposition and alveolar septal thickening. the factor is necessary but not sufficient for pathologic fibrosis of the lungs. miRNA expression profiling in airway biopsies from patients with mild asthma revealed no differences in miRNA expression. applications of miRNA-based therapy for inflammatory lung diseases are less advanced than those for lung cancer [136] miRNA replacement therapy involves the re-introduction of a tumor suppressor miRNA mimic to restore a loss of the function. let-7 is a tumor-suppressor miRNA in non-small-cell lung cancer that inversely correlates with the expression of the RAS oncoprotein, a key cancer gene. antisense oligonucleotides are termed antagomirs or \u201cLNA-antimiRs\u201d [144,145] they are oligonucleotides with sequences complementary to the endogenous miRNA and inhibit the specific miRNA function. an LNA-antimiR against miR-122 has been shown to effectively silence miR-122 in non-human primates. miRNAs related with cancer stem cells may significantly broaden the field of miRNA-based therapy. the main challenge is the successful delivery and chemical modifications of the therapeutic miRNAs to the target tissue without harming normal tissues. RNAi-based approaches provide a promising therapeutic modality for the treatment of various lung diseases."}
