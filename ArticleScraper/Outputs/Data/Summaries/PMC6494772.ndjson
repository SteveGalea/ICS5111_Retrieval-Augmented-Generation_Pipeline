{"summary": "chronic periodontitis patients were classified based on their compliance level. factors affecting PC-SPT and the prognosis of PC-SPT were investigated. the American Academy of Periodontology has emphasized the importance of SPT, defining it as treatment to prevent or minimize the recurrence and progression of periodontal disease in patients with gingivitis, periodontitis, and peri-implantitis. only 4% of 572 patients with moderate periodontitis experienced tooth removal during a 4-year SPT period, with an annual mean alveolar bone height increase of 0.02 mm. PC decreased from 13.9% to 9% in the first 6 years of SPT. however, as dentists continued to inform patients of the importance of SPT, PC-SPT increased to 48.4% over the next 5 years. the average PC-SPT stabilized at 43.2% over the next 5 years. study focuses on classifying patients based on previous dental treatments. it is important to retrospectively and comprehensively evaluate the effects of patient characteristics on PC-SPT and the treatment prognosis associated with PC-SPT. two investigators jointly reviewed patients' clinical and radiographic records. radiographic measurements were performed using the scale tool of the picture archiving and communication system. the mean value obtained by 2 investigators was used. patients who visited at least 2 times during the SPT period were evaluated. patients were classified according to compliance as follows. the effect of PC-SPT on treatment prognosis was evaluated. the lowest margin of restorations or the cementoenamel junction of natural teeth was set as the reference point. the distance from the reference point to the alveolar bone crest was measured on the mesial and distal sides of the tooth. the measurements before and after SPT were compared and classified as having exhibited a decrease (), maintenance (0), or an increase (+) patients judged inappropriate for inclusion in the study based on the author's discretion. chronic periodontitis was also diagnosed in patients who had significant bone loss in the interdental space and the tooth root furcation on panoramic radiographs. patients undergoing SPT every 3 months who visited 3 times a year were classified according to compliance. the duration of SPT varied from 3 to 5 years, so PC-SPT calculations were based on the SPT period for each patient. the effect of PC-SPT on the prognosis of periodontal treatment was evaluated. changes in alveolar bone levels around all remaining teeth were measured using X-ray views. the lowest margin of restorations or the cementoenamel junction of natural teeth was set as the reference point. males constituted 49.0% and females constituted 51.0% of the study population. the proportion of patients who lived within 10 km from the hospital was 75.2%. patients who had implants before SPT initiation accounted for 32.5% of the study population. 67.5% of patients showed no newly decayed teeth, but at least 1 decayed tooth was found in 32.5% of the patients. no increase in alveolar bone levels around implants was found, unlike in teeth (17.5%). the maintenance rate of implants was higher than that of teeth, similar to the changes in alveolar bone levels. the effect on PC-SPT was not statistically significant. the periodontal treatment method before SPT had no significant effect on PC-SPT. male patients accounted for 62.1% and 57.3% of the CCG and ECG respectively. female patients comprised 58.8% and 64.7% of the ICG and NCG, respectively. Male 18 (62.1) 43 (57.3) 28 (41.2) 12 (35.3) Female 11 (37.9) 32 (42.7) 40 (58.8) 22 (64.7) Distance between hospital and residence 0.801 Short (within 10 km) 23 (79.3) 54 (72.0) 51 (75.0) 27 (79.4) Long (more than 10 km) 6 (20.7) 21 (28.0) 17 (25.0) 7 (20.6) Implantation 0.003a) No 23 (79.3) 39 (52.0) 49 (72.1) in the NCG, 94.1% of patients had 0 newly decayed teeth. no patients had 4 or more newly decayed teeth. maintenance was less common in the high PC-SPT groups. the NCG group had the highest proportion of patients with 0 newly extracted teeth. the proportions of newly extracted teeth and 2 or more newly extracted teeth were highest in the ECG (46.6% and 21.3%, respectively) the majority of patients were in their 30s, 40s, and 50s. males constituted 49.0% and females constituted 51.0% of the study population. patients who had implants before SPT initiation accounted for 32.5% of the study population. patients who were diagnosed with moderate or advanced periodontitis underwent FO on 1\u20132 or more than 3 sextants accounted for 20.4% and 5.3% of the study population. other treatments were divided into implantation and mucogingival surgery. in total, 9.7% of patients received other treatments, including both those who did and did not receive periodontitis treatment. treatment prognosis was evaluated by regular clinical and radiographic examinations during SPT. 67.5% of the patients showed no newly decayed teeth, but at least 1 decayed tooth was found in 32.5% of the patients. no increase in alveolar bone levels around implants was found. 79.3% of patients in their 40s and under were in the CCG. in the other groups, patients in their 30s, 40s, and 50s accounted for the majority. the effect on PC-SPT was not statistically significant. female patients comprised 58.8% and 64.7% of the ICG and NCG respectively. female sex was associated with lower PC-SPT. in the NCG, 82.4% of patients had no implants, which was the highest proportion of no implantation across all groups. SRP 15 (51.7) 37 (49.3) 35 (51.5) 16 (47.1) SRP+FO 1\u20132 8 (27.6) 13 (17.3) 17 (25.0) 4 (11.8) SRP+FO 3\u2013 0 (0.0) 4 (5.3) 2 (2.9) 5 (14.7). maintenance was less common in the high PC-SPT groups. decreased alveolar bone levels were more common in the high PC-SPT groups. unstable outcomes were more common in the high PC-SPT groups. implants were maintained in over 90% of patients in all groups. 1 implant was removed in the ECG (2.8%) and in the ICG (5.3%) (P=0.870) all categories except for the removal of implants showed statistically significant differences. DISCUSSION Chronic periodontitis is a slowly progressing disease that is affected by a patient's lifestyle, systemic condition, and external environmental factors. chronic periodontitis is a slowly progressing disease that is affected by a patient's lifestyle, systemic condition, and external environmental factors. sex and the presence of an implant significantly affected PC-SPT. men accounted for 62.1% and 57.3% of the high PC-SPT groups. female patients accounted for 58.8% and 64.7% of the ICG and the NCG. at least 1 implant showed higher compliance than those without implants. this may be due to the pain of tooth loss, the time required for dental treatment, and the financial burden involved. these patients realize the importance of regular dental examinations, leading to a higher compliance rate. 94.1% of the patients did not have newly decayed teeth. this result can be interpreted as indicating that these patients did not visit regularly during SPT. maintenance of the alveolar bone level around teeth was higher in the low PC-SPT groups (ICG [70.6%] and NCG [88.2%]) bone levels around implants were not found in any of the PC-SPT groups. this discrepancy most likely occurred because implants do not have the periodontal ligament. this plays an important role in the regeneration of periodontal tissue. a patient who belonged to the ECG in this study underwent tooth extraction due to a tooth fracture, which bore no relationship to periodontitis. this result was not statistically significant in this study, and a limitation of this study is that it did not investigate such problems. sex and the presence of an implant had a significant effect on PC-SPT."}
