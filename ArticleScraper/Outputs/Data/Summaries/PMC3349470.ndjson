{"summary": "despite the clinical importance of feline retroviruses, information about FeLV and FIV in peninsular Malaysia is insufficient to properly advise veterinarians and pet owners. a cross-sectional study was carried out from January 2010 to December 2010 to determine the prevalence and risk factors associated with FeLV and FIV among domestic cats. FeLV and FIV are clinically important retroviruses affecting domestic and non-domestic felids. the two pathogens provide useful models of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) and human T-cell leukaemia virus (HTLV) the seroprevalence of FeLV or FIV was greater in clinically sick (FeLV, 23.2%; FIV, 38.4%) compared to healthy cats (FeLV, 5.1%; FIV, 23.6%). in client-owned (13.1%) compared to shelter cats (10.3%).
