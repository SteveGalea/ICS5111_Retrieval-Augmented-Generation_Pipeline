{"summary": "GENOME ANNOUNCEMENT Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) belongs to group III of the genus Coronaviridae. it is an enveloped, unsegmented, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) virus and has a genome of approximately 27.6 kb (2). recent epidemiological analysis reports suggest nephropathogenic IBVs have become increasingly prevalent in china. strain SC021202 has lower nucleotide identities of 88.1%, 87.9%, and 87.7% to the most popularly used IBV vaccine strains, H120, H52, and M41 respectively. recombination detection methods revealed that SAIBK is a chimera virus, with recombination by the SC021202 strain as a major parent and the H120 vaccine strain as a minor parent. the field IBVs in Sichuan Province have undergone genetic recombination. the complete genome sequence of the SAIBK isolate was submitted to GenBank and assigned the accession number."}
