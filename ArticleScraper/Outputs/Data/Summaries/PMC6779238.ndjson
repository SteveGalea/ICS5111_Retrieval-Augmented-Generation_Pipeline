{"summary": "the severity of MERS ranges from asymptomatic or mild disease to acute respiratory distress syndrome leading to death. clinical features include fever, cough, shortness of breath, and multi-organ failure resulting in death. a large outbreak in south Korea suggested that MERS remains a serious threat to global public health. an estimated 55,000 people still die of rabies annually, with cases reported from >150 countries and territories among various animals and humans. inactivated rabies vaccines are currently available worldwide; however, they are not an ideal strategy because they require frequent administrations (4\u20136 doses) RV-L protein is a multi-functional protein that serves to stabilize the RV-L protein, a major component of the viral RNA polymerase [20\u201322]. RVP and RVM remain capable of expressing viral proteins, assembling, and propagating only in specially constructed cells expressing the RV-P and RV-M proteins. cell lines expressing recombinant RV-P protein (BHK-P) were grown in DMEM-10FBS and 200 g/mL Zeocin (Thermo Fisher Scientific), Waltham, MA, USA. a bivalent-vaccine candidate against MERS-CoV and RV was developed using RVP as a vector. membrane of the virion, RV-G transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains was fused with the S1 protein. cDNA encoding the RV-G transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains together with 14 amino acids of the ectodomain of RV-G (RV/TMCD) was amplified with primers harboring BsiWI and PstI restriction enzyme sites at the 5\u2032 ends, followed by cloning of the p a recombinant HEP virus (rHEP) was rescued from full-length cDNA of the HEP-Flury strain and propagated in BHK-P cells. for the animal experiments, RVP and RVP-MERS/S1 were purified and concentrated. the supernatant was filtered using 0.45-m polyethersulfone membrane filters. the released viruses were concentrated by precipitation with 7% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000 (WAKO, Osaka, Japan) purified by ultracentrifugation of the precipitate for 90 min at 83,000 g with 60% and 20% sucrose (WAKO) fluorescence images were observed using a confocal laser-scanning microscope (FluoView FV3000; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) to detect RV-N expression, cells were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled anti-RV mAb. primary antibody used to detect the MERS-CoV spike protein was a polyclonal antibody against tubulin. secondary antibodies for the detection were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) all mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with 100 L of each virus solution containing 107 FFU/mL or PBS. the day on which mice were inoculated with viruses defined as day 0. Blood samples were collected by cardiac puncture. heat-inactivated sera described in previous subsection were serially diluted 2-fold. 50 L sera was added to each well of the 96-well cell culture plates. cells were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 48 h and then fixed with 80% acetone. all animals infected with RV were handled in biosafety level 2 animal facilities in accordance with NIID guidelines. humane endpoints were used as early indicators of animal pain or distress that could be used to avoid or limit suffering by taking actions such as humane euthanasia. cDNA encoding the RV-G transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains was amplified with primers harboring BsiWI and PstI restriction enzyme sites at the 5\u2032 ends. p3.1-defP fragment was digested and inserted into plasmid p5.1-defP-RV/TMCD. p5.1-defP-MERS/S1-RV/TMCD was a primary target of VNAs recombinant HEP-Flury (rHEP) has a complete genome of RV HEP-Flury strain (upper) RVP lacks the RV-P gene (middle) RVP-MERS/S1 harbors the MERS-CoV S1 gene fused with the C-terminal region of RV G protein (amino acids 446 to 524) BHK-P cells were infected with RVP-MERS/S1 or RVP at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of between 0.05/cell and 0.5/cell. the supernatant was filtered using 0.45-m polyethersulfone membrane filters. the released viruses were concentrated by precipitation with 7% polyethylene glycol (PEG 6000, Osaka, Japan) h were stained with mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) against MERS-CoV S1. cells were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled anti-RV mAb. fluorescent images were observed using a confocal laser-scanning microscope. samples were separated using precast 10% gels for sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. they were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. primary antibody used to detect RV-G was anti-RV-G mAb15-13 [42]. mice were injected with RVP-MERS/S1, RVP, or rHEP. mice were inoculated intracerebrally with 20 L of each virus solution. mice were observed for clinical signs for 3 weeks. 96-well culture plates were inoculated with each of the serum-virus mixtures. cells were fixed with 10% formalin and stained with crystal violet. the neutralization titer was determined as the highest dilution that showed at least 50% CPE inhibition. all data were analyzed using STATA for Windows (v.13.1; StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA) or JMP software (v.11.0; SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) animal ethics statement All animal studies were performed in strict accordance with recommendations described in the Guidelines for Proper Conduct of Animal Experiments of the Science Council of Japan. western blotting analysis confirmed the existence of the MERS-CoV S1 protein in RVP-MERS/S1-infected BHK-P cells. the MERS-CoV S1 protein was detected in both RVP-MERS/S1- and RVP-infected BHK-P cells. RV-G protein and MERS-S1 protein expression were confirmed with western blotting using monoclonal antibody against RV-G and polyclonal antibody against MERS-CoV S1 protein. recombinant MERS-CoV S1 protein were used as a positive control. RVP-MERS/S1 and RVP pathogenicity in suckling mice. suckling mice were intracerebrally inoculated with RVP-MERS/S1 or RVP. no mice inoculated with RVP-MERS/S1 showed any rabies-associated signs. mice were inoculated once or twice with RVP-MERS/S1 or RVP. titers of VNAs against MERS-CoV and RV were determined using sera from these mice. no significant differences were observed in VNA titers against RV among mouse groups inoculated with RVP and RVP-MERS/S1. mice were inoculated with RVP-MERS/S1 or RVP as control. mice were inoculated with RVP-MERS/S1 or RVP as control. expression of MERS-CoV S1 protein confirmed in BHK-P cells infected with RVP-MERS/S1 but not in RVP-infected BHK-P cells. RV-N-antigen-positive cells were observed in both RVP-MERS/S1- and RVP-infected BHK-P cells. RV-G protein and MERS-S1 protein expression were confirmed with western blotting using monoclonal antibody against RV-G and polyclonal antibody against MERS-CoV S1 protein. recombinant MERS-CoV S1 protein were used as a positive control. suckling mice were intracerebrally inoculated with RVP-MERS/S1 or RVP. no mice inoculated with RVP-MERS/S1 or RVP showed any rabies-associated signs, and all survived the observation period. titers of VNAs against MERS-CoV and RV were determined using sera from these mice. significant differences were found between mice inoculated twice with RVP and RVP-MERS/S1. significant differences were observed in VNA titers against RV among mouse groups inoculated with RVP and RVP-MERS/S1. a recombinant P-gene-deficient RV expressing the MERS-CoV S1 protein was generated as a bivalent-vaccine candidate to MERS-CoV and RV. the recombinant viral vector is considered among the most promising. recombinant RVs expressing various foreign antigens elicit protective immunity against corresponding pathogens. inactivated replication-competent RV expressing the MERS-CoV S1 protein elicited VNAs. ERS-CoV infection following immunization with RVP-MERS/S1 suggests its potential efficacy in other mammals, including humans. a previous study reported the avirulence of a replication-deficient RV virus expressing Ebola virus glycoprotein according to the survival of all adult and suckling mice intra. a replication-competent RV vaccine recovered from the SAD B19 RV wildlife vaccine strain retained its neurovirulence in suckling mice. a recombinant virus containing the S gene of MERS-CoV with the deletion of C-terminal 16 amino acids was rescued but did not express the S1 protein with the variable deletion of S1 gene in the genome. insertion of the S1 subunit is reportedly more effective than insertion of the full-length S gene. this might be because immunization with the S1 subunit can induce humoral immune responses more efficiently than that with the full-length S protein [62,63] there might remain concerns regarding the safety of using vaccines that express the full-length S protein. this study builds upon previous work describing the usefulness of an RVP-based vaccine against lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. it supports further application of RVP-based bivalent-vaccine development against rabies."}
