{"summary": "the burden of critical illness is especially high in developing countries. the region known as Southeast Asia consists of 10 independent countries. the region is one of the most disaster-prone regions in the world. literature has revealed a significant lack of scientific data addressing the issues of emergency and advanced life support care in Southeast Asia. a part of this review will be based on the personal experiences of the authors. the aim of this article is to discuss the challenges faced in the delivery of care to the critically ill child in this region. the combination of interventions that make up IMCI has been adapted by some countries in the Southeast Asia region to include conditions that are important in the local settings. for example, dengue fever has been added to the list of diseases to monitor for in children with fever in Cambodia, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, the Philippines, and Vietnam. most sick children can be managed at ambulatory care centers, but 12 to 30% are seriously ill and need referral to hospitals for further assessment and treatment. the quality of hospital care is therefore likely to have an impact on the health and survival of many children in LRS. there is substantial global experience with strategies and interventions that can be used to improve quality of care for children in hospitals with limited resources. this includes the development of a toolkit by WHO containing adaptable instruments, including a framework for quality improvement, evidence-based clinical guidelines in the form of a Pocketbook of Hospital Care for Children. guidelines for the treatment of sepsis in children have been proposed. the use of these guidelines could be affected by resource limitations. there are also differences in the spectrum of diseases encountered, such as dengue and malaria in the southeast Asian countries. the lack of effective retrieval and transport services for ill children has led to a tendency toward small-sized intensive care units in both urban and district hospitals instead of a concentration of resources in regional centers. current pediatric advanced life support guidelines may not be entirely suitable for use in LRS. training should include motivation to translate knowledge into clinical practice and care delivery that would benefit patients. issues of adequate remuneration, job satisfaction, morale, and professionalism need to be addressed. medical councils have an important role to play in improving hospital care. progress has been made to improve the survival of critically ill children in the region. there remains a significant disparity in the quality of newborn and child interventions among countries in this region as well as within individual countries."}
