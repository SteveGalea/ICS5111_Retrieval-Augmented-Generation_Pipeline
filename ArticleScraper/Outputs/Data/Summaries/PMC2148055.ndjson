{"summary": "the complete yeast genome is known since 1996 and comprises 6000 genes. more than 60% of yeast genes share conserved amino acid sequences with at least one known or predicted human protein. studies in yeast have been essential for understanding fundamental cellular processes. gene-expression libraries include plasmids in which each yeast gene is cloned under the control of the galactose-inducible promoter. a further set of plasmids have been created in which the yeast proteins are fused with different tags such as the Flag epitope, the glutathione S. transferase (GST) or the histidine 6 repeat (his6) [11-14]. systematic genome-wide screenings can be used to character yeast/virus systems allow the replication of higher eukayotic viruses in yeast. the third and fourth sections will focus on recent advances in applied virus research, the use of yeast as a tool for antiviral drug development and as a vaccine vehicle. studies in S. cerevisiae demonstrated that the PR specifically arrested cell growth and induced cell lysis mediated by the loss of membrane integrity [23]. the contribution of HIV-1 PR to HIV-induced necrosis was later confirmed with a CD4+ human T cell line. a PR-specific inhibitor led to prevention of virus-induced cell lysis. studies in yeast and human cells showed that NS5a mutants were transported to the nucleus due to a functional NLS. caspase-mediated cleavage of NS5a resulted in similar truncations which translocated to the nucleus. however, in which way the NS5a-dependent transactivation contributes to HCV pathogenesis remains to be elucidated. HCV IRES-mediated translation is modified by the 3'-NTR. several viral and probably also host proteins bind to the 5'-NTR of HCV. bicistronic construct generated will allow to fully explore the effect of viral and cellular factors on HCV translation. all RNA viruses that have been shown to replicate in yeast belong to the group of (+)RNA viruses. this group includes many important plant, animal and human pathogens such as HCV and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. the identification of host factors involved in viral RNA replication is a priority area of research in virology because it can provide new targets for antiviral drug development. the use of traditional yeast genetics and genome-wide screenings have resulted in the groundbreaking identification of multiple host factors required for viral RNA replication. a genome-wide screening was performed in the yeast Tet promoter Hughes collection (yTHC) with TBSV [62], which covers 800 of the 1000 essential genes. TBSV replicates in yeast but also undergoes recombination [49] two approaches have been traditionally used: in vitro assays to identify small molecule inhibitors. if the target is already known, the drug discovery search classically starts with in vitro assays to identify small molecule inhibitors. if toxicity is detected, the underlying mechanism will still be unknown. ufficiency approach uses haploid or homozygous diploid deletion collection. third approach uses gene expression libraries and is based on the principle that increasing the concentration of a protein that is the target of an inhibitory drug should increase resistance to the drug. two yeast cell-based assays have been established to screen for viral inhibitors. the protein M2 of influenza virus has a fundamental role in the disassembly of the influenza virion. this protein is essential for the virus and recognizes a 40 amino acid sequence. heterozygote yeast deletion collection was used to asses cellular effects of 78 different compounds. each yeast gene was replaced with a cassette containing the selectable marker gene KanMx plus two unique tag sequences located up- and down-stream of the marker gene. these tag sequences enabled rapid analysis of strains in a pool by using hybridization to high-density nucleotide arrays. a recombinantly expressed hepatitis B surface antigen has become a safe and efficient prophylactic vaccine worldwide. a vaccine vehicle Yeast has been used in vaccine development. it is used not as a mere production tool but as a vaccine vehicle itself. inant yeast cells represent novel vaccination tool for induction of potent cell-mediated immune responses against target antigens. non-pathogenic baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been used as antigen carrier because this genus combines several advantages. recombinant yeast cells express the HCV NS3-Core fusion protein as an immunotherapeutic vaccine in chronic HCV-infected individuals. one advantage of using whole recombinant yeasts as antigen carriers is the oral application route. the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe represents, like a physiologically and genetically well characterized eukaryote. the interplay between protective and inhibitory antibodies dictates the outcome of experimentally disseminated Candidiasis in mice receiving a heat-inactivated whole-cell C. albicans vaccine. however, subjects with elevated anti-Candida antibody titers remain nonetheless susceptible to invasive candidiasis. studies in s. cerevisiae demonstrated that the PR specifically arrested cell growth and induced cell lysis mediated by the loss of membrane integrity. the role of the Rev protein plays an essential role in the HIV replication cycle. the protein mediates the export of unspliced and incompletely spliced HIV mRNAs to the cytoplasm. the non-structural protein 5a (NS5a) and the core protein have made yeast a valuable tool in HCV research. in yeast and human cells, the NS5a protein predominantly associates with the ER membrane through the highly conserved amphiphatic alpha-helix in its N-terminus [28,29] this is consistent with its proposed role as a key regulator for membrane-associated viral replication. a bicistronic vector has been recently designed to study HCV RNA translation in yeast [42] the bicistronic construct generated will allow to fully explore the effect of viral and cellular factors on HCV translation. a better understanding of the HIV replication cycle and the viral and host factors involved are essential to develop new therapy options. studies in S. cerevisiae demonstrated that the PR specifically arrested cell growth and induced cell lysis mediated by the loss of membrane integrity [23]. the contribution of HIV-1 PR to HIV-induced necrosis was later confirmed with a CD4+ human T cell line. a PR-specific inhibitor led to prevention of virus-induced cell lysis. the NS5a protein predominantly associates with the ER membrane through the highly conserved amphiphatic alpha-helix in its N-terminus [28,29] this is consistent with its proposed role as a key regulator for membrane-associated viral replication. studies in yeast and human cells showed that N-terminally truncated NS5a mutants were transported to the nucleus due to a functional NLS. osomal entry site (IRES) is located at the 5'non-translated region (IRES) the bicistronic construct generated will allow to fully explore the effect of viral and cellular factors on HCV translation. the complex complex of higher eukaryotic host organisms has been hampered by the complexity of higher eukaryotic host organisms. all RNA viruses that have been shown to replicate in yeast belong to the group of (+)RNA viruses. the genomic RNA serves as messenger RNA (mRNA) for translation of the viral proteins and as template for replication. viral life cycles were studied like translation of viral proteins, the process of template selection, viral RNA replication, encapsidation and recombination. the results go much beyond the specific virus studied. the identification of host factors involved in viral RNA replication is a priority area of research in virology because it can provide new targets for antiviral drug development. a genome-wide screening was performed in the yeast Tet promoter Hughes collection (yTHC) with TBSV [62], which covers 800 of the 1000 essential genes. TBSV replicates in yeast but also undergoes recombination [49]. if the target is already known, the drug discovery search classically starts with in vitro assays to identify small molecule inhibitors. these assays give only a partial view of the effect of the compounds since they cannot fully explore drug effects on other additional targets. if toxicity is detected, the underlying mechanism will still be unknown. the drug-induced haploinsufficiency approach uses the heterozygous mutant collection and is based on the principle that the deletion of a gene that renders cell-hypersensitivity to a specific drug can significantly sensitize a diploid cell to that drug. the third approach uses gene expression libraries and is based on the principle that increasing the concentration of a protein that is the target of an inhibitory drug should increase resistance to the drug. yeast cell-based assays have been established to screen for viral inhibitors. the protein M2 of influenza virus has a fundamental role in the disassembly of the influenza virion. a parallel approach has been applied to the serine protease encoded by the human cytomegalovirus. heterozygote yeast deletion collection was used to asses the cellular effects of 78 different compounds. each yeast gene was replaced with a cassette containing the selectable marker gene KanMx plus two unique tag sequences located up- and down-stream of the marker gene. these tag sequences enabled rapid analysis of strains in a pool by using hybridization to high-density nucleotide arrays. hepatitis B surface antigen has become a safe and efficient prophylactic vaccine worldwide. yeast as a vaccine vehicle has been used in vaccine development. soluble antigens formulated with adjuvants effectively activate the humoral immune response. recombinant yeast cells represent novel vaccination tool for induction of potent cell-mediated immune responses against target antigens [77] non-pathogenic baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been used as antigen carrier because this genus combines several advantages. recombinant yeast cell vaccine expresses the HCV NS3-Core fusion protein as an immunotherapeutic vaccine in patients with colorectal, pancreatic and non-small cell lung cancers [77] the same group has evaluated a recombinant yeast cell vaccine that expresses the HCV NS3-Core fusion protein as an immunotherapeutic vaccine in chronic HCV-infected individuals. the interplay between protective and inhibitory antibodies dictates the outcome of experimentally disseminated Candidiasis in mice receiving a heat-inactivated whole-cell C. albicans vaccine [87], 87. this observation may explain why subjects with elevated anti-Candida antibody titers remain nonetheless susceptible to invasive candidiasis.
