{"summary": "improved surveillance in the southern hemisphere is needed to provide critical data on influenza epidemiology, disease burden, circulating strains and effectiveness of influenza prevention and control measures. aims were to measure incidence, prevalence, risk factors, clinical spectrum and outcomes for SARI and associated influenza and other respiratory pathogen cases. a surveillance system can provide critical data on the epidemiology, burden, impact, circulating influenza, other respiratory pathogens and effectiveness of influenza prevention and control measures. new Zealand is an excellent location for population-based research with its predominantly public funded health-care system. a major component of the SHIVERS project is to conduct hospital-based surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections. this report describes the implementation of this hospital-based surveillance system and provides some preliminary results from the first influenza season of its operation. the specific aims of the hospital-based surveillance are to establish active, prospective, continuous, population-based surveillance for hospitalized SARI cases. 0.8 1.4 1.7 Unknown 4.2 5.5 1.3 NZDep2006 1 10.3 9.6 0.9 2 10.2 10.1 1.0 3 10.2 9.8 1.0 4 10.0 8.6 0.9 5 9.9 8.2 0.8 6 9.9 7.9 0.8 7 9.9 8.3 0.8 8 9.8 9.9 1.0 9 10.0 11.3 1.1 10 9.8 16.2 1.6 Unknown 0.1 0.1 0.5 Total (n) 100.0 (4 027 929) 100.0 (837 ICD-10 J00\u201399) was 9431 and influenza and pneumonia and acute lower respiratory tract infections (ICD-10 J09\u201322) was 5033. based on an average annual increase in respiratory disease admissions of 2.6% from 2006 to 2010 it was expected that the number of respiratory disease hospitalizations would increase by 10% in 2012. in 2012, 10 374 patients (ICD-10 J00\u201399) and 5537 patients (ICD-10 J09\u201322) would be admitted overnight with respiratory diseases. approximately 50% of the preschool-aged children with a discharge diagnosis of pneumonia met the WHO case definition for pneumonia. an average of 5500\u201310 000 annual cases of hospitalized respiratory diseases with 50% meeting the WHO case definition would result in 2800\u20135000 hospitalized SARI cases.

CMDHB laboratory used ausDiagnostic PCR assay (Bordetella and atypical pneumonia, Cat. 3078) to detect pan-Legionella, Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, pan-Chlamydia, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Bordetella pertussis, Bordetella parapertussis and Pneumocystis jiroveci. the ADHB laboratory used blood culture media, BD Bactec-plus aerobic/F and Bactec Lytic/10 anaerobic/F from BioM\u00e9rieux (Auckland, New Zealand) the CMDHB laboratory used ausDiagnostic PCR assay (Bordetella and atypical pneumonia, Cat. 3078) to detect pan-Legionella; Legionella longbeachae, Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, pan-Chlamy 59 124 acute admissions to ADHB and CMDHB hospitals were assessed. a total of 4417 (7.5%) patients with suspected respiratory infections were assessed. of the 1430 SARI cases from whom nasopharyngeal specimens were collected, 324 (22.7%) had influenza viruses. SHIVERS SARI surveillance system provides a comprehensive and thorough algorithm for case ascertainment and testing for all SARI and some non-SARI cases. it offers an opportunity to evaluate sensitivity and specificity of the WHO SARI case definition and predicting symptoms for capturing non-influenza respiratory viruses. a hospital-based control population without respiratory illness will be added to investigate specific risk factors for influenza and other respiratory diseases. the case report form captures information by interviewing patients/caregivers through their recall, which generates bias. the ministry of health in new Zealand plans to add influenza vaccination to its national immunization register in 2014. SARI surveillance is limited in identifying influenza virus-infected patients with atypical clinical presentations (respiratory and non-respiratory) influenza infection can lead to more severe illness and complications such as primary viral pneumonia, secondary bacterial pneumonia, cardiac complications and neurological complications."}
