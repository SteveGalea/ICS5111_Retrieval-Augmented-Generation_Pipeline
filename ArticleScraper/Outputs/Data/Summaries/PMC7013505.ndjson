{"summary": "epidemic episodes of transmissible diseases (e.g., Ebola, Zika, Middle East respiratory syndrome, etc.) have raised the attention of supranational and national governments based on their mortality, morbidity, and impact on the sustainability of country and regional healthcare systems. in total, 1326 million and 1401 million international travelers were recorded in 2017 and 2018, respectively. the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia show the highest annual incidence of typhoid fever (>100 cases per 100,000 cases annually), followed by Southern Africa (10\u2013100 per 100,000 cases annually) typhoid fever is one of the most frequently diagnosed vaccine-preventable diseases in returned international travelers and migrants coming from high-end countries [10,11]. a study in april revealed the risk of traveling in the Indian subcontinent during 2004\u20132011. a retrospective study in Qatar, between 2005 and 2012, reported 356 cases of typhoid fever, of whom 96.9% had traveled abroad. over 70% of typhoid fever cases in Europe are acquired abroad and frequently caused by strains with marked antibiotic resistance profile. ten years of surveillance in the UK showed lower rates of enteric fever in UK-born vs. migrant populations. migrants from south Asian countries are at highest risk of enteric fever. in total, 207 records, published between January 2013 and October 2019, were found. twenty-three (32.4%) focused on epidemiological characteristics of enteric fever, fourteen (19.7%) on vaccines, fourteen (19.7%) on antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella spp. serotypes, ten (14.1%) on population groups at higher risk of acquiring typhoid fever. 1.9 million children traveled overseas every year from the united states. a high proportion of enteric fever cases was described in children aged 0\u201314 years (>26% in 2018). a high proportion of enteric fever cases was described in children aged 0\u201314 years (>26% in 2018) hepatitis A is the first vaccine administered to Swiss (53%) and Italian (63%), followed by tetanus\u2013diphtheria in Swiss (45.6%) and typhoid-fever vaccine in Italian (44.6%) travel destinations can increase the request of pre-travel care (e.g., India and Thailand chosen for pleasure or business) anwar and Colleagues reported a preventive effect between one third and one half of the cases in the first two years after the vaccination. an acceptable immunogenicity and safety profile was shown when co-administered with yellow-fever and quadrivalent meningococcal vaccines. a second dose is recommended after three years. the purified Vi capsular polysaccharide vaccine is not recommended in children aged 2 years for its poor immunogenicity. the live attenuated oral vaccine Ty21a is not well tolerated in children aged under five years [47] typhoid fever in travelers has significantly changed during the last two decades following the widespread distribution of MDR bacteria. a definitive diagnosis of typhoid fever requires cultural or molecular methods. specimens collected ideally before the administration of an antimicrobial therapy. antimicrobial susceptibility testing is strongly recommended for clinical (prescription of a tailored antibiotic therapy) and public health (surveillance) purposes. g S I R Disk Content g S R Ampicillin 8 16 32 10 17 14\u201316 13 8 8 10 14 14 Cefotaxime 1 2 4 30 26 23\u201325 22 1 2 5 20 17 Ciprofloxacin for 5\u20137 days is prescribed. alternative drugs are chloramphenicol (50\u201375 mg/kg/day) for 14\u201321 days, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (8 mg/kg/day) for 14 days, or amoxicillin (75\u2013100 mg/kg/day) for 14 days. cases of severe enteric fever, characterized by delirium, stupor, coma, or obtundation, can be successfully treated with corticosteroids. >60% of the isolates had reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid, as well as alarming increasing trends of resistance of S. typhi and paratyphi A [62]. antimicrobial resistance pattern for Salmonella ser.
