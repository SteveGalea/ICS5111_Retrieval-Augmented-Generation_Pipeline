{"summary": "astronomical number of expected exoplanets suggests there is a high statistical chance that life has also evolved somewhere else. this possibility stimulates the thinking of how life started on the early Earth, which may help extrapolate to other planets. ribozymes naturally consist of circular single-stranded RNAs. they lack the genetic triplet code and do not encode proteins. ncRNAs within such a pool can bind amino acids. tRNA-amino acid complexes can find RNAs as \u201cmRNAs\u201d. ribozymes are the essential catalytic elements in ribosomes. small peptides with basic amino acids can increase catalytic activity of ribozymes. ribosomes may have been functionally important during evolution of ribosomes. these pre-ribosomal structures are also similar to precursor-like structures of retroviruses. deoxyribonucleotides can arise by removal of an oxygen without the need of a protein enzyme. ncDNA amounts to more than 98% of the human DNA genome. higher organisms tend to have more non-coding information. ncRNA can range from close to zero in the smallest bacteria such as Pelagibacter ubique to about 98% in the human genome. ribonucleotides, lipids and amino acids can be formed from C, H, O, P, N, S in a \u201cone pot\u201d synthesis. the reverse transcriptase is an important link between the RNA and the DNA worlds. viruses containing tRNA-like structures (TLS) are resembling these early RNAs. only half a tRNA is found in Narnaviruses of fungi. they look like \u201cfrozen\u201d precursor-like elements for protein synthesis. the viroids known today are ranging from 246 to 467 nucleotides. they contain circular single-stranded RNA, are protein-free and self-replicating. the genome of TMV is protein-coding single-stranded RNA of about 6,400 nucleotides. ozyme activity is a functional, not a genetic loss. only the nuclear variants, the Pospiviroidae, can lose their ribozyme activity. a function, the catalytic activity, gets lost inside the nucleus of a host cell. viroid is known as hepatitis delta virus (HDV) it has the smallest genome of any known animal virus of 1,680 nucleotides. it contains circRNA, forms similar hairpin-loops and replicates in the nucleus. viroids and related RNAs are the smallest known replicons. smaller ones would become extinct in the absence of repair systems. RNA-protein world contains numerous ncRNAs with key functions. ncRNA is essential in our biological DNA world today. it is possible to produce such ncRNA today in the test tube by loss of genic information from protein-coding RNA. this reduction was demonstrated in vitro with phage RNA. reversion to simplicity, reduction in size, loss of genetic information and speed in replication can be major forces of life. the experiment can perhaps be generalized from the test tube to a principle, that the most successful survivors on our planet are the viruses and microorganisms. this may be overcome by heat flow across an open pore in submerged rocks. the gut microbiome in human patients with obesity is reminiscent of the gene reduction described in the Spiegelman experiment: reduction of genes in a rich environment. the reduction of the complexity of the microbiome is in part attributed to the action of phages, which under such conditions, defined as stress, lyse the bacteria. mimiviruses were first discovered in cooling water towers in Bradford, united kingdom in 2003 with about 1,000 genes. they contain elements that were considered hallmarks of living cells, not of viruses, such as elements required for protein synthesis, tRNAs and amino acid transferases. the mimiviruses harbor these building blocks as incomplete sets not sufficient for independent protein synthesis as bacteria or archaea can perform. smaller Pandoraviruses with 1 micron in length have five times larger genomes. size distribution of viruses (red circles), free-living bacteria and eukaryotes (black circles) are shown relative to their frequencies. the transition is not a sharp borderline as shown by the circles. the ribozymes may have been the earliest replicating entity. only later viruses may have given up their autonomous replication. Efforts have been made to identify the smallest living cell. the world of viruses covers a range of three logs in size of their genomes. from zero genes to about 2,500 genes amounting to about 2,500,000 bp of DNA. the zero-gene viroids are about 300 bases in length. the virosphere is the most successful reservoir of biological entities on our planet. the origin of REs is being discussed as remnants of ancient retroviral germline infections that became evolutionarily fixed in the genome. about 450,000 human ERV elements constitute about 8% of the human genome consisting of hallmark retroviral elements like the gag, pol, env genes and flanking long terminal repeats. a frequent gene reduction of eukaryotic genomes is the loss of the viral envelope protein encoded by the env gene. without a coat, retroviruses can no longer leave the cell and infect other cells. they lose mobility and become obligatory intracellular elements. viral integration is not limited to eukaryotic cells but also a mechanism in prokaryotes for maintenance of the lysogenic state of phages inside bacteria. also, for other eukaryotic viruses such as HBV, the envelope surface antigen BHsAg can be deleted, which leads to an obligatory intracellular life style for the virus. viruses have been proven to be drivers of evolution, including the human genome. the same property which causes immunodeficiency in HIV-infected patients and leads to AIDS causes cell fusion after infection by a retrovirus. many koalas fell ill and died, yet some populations became resistant within about 100 years. the retrovirus is transmitted as exogenous as well as endogenous virus, similar to the jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV), whereby the endogenized viruses protect with a viral gene product, such as Env. retroviruses protect a cell against a new infection by a similar virus designated as \u201csuperinfection exclusion\u201d or viral interference. this is mediated by viral gene products such as proteins or nucleic acids. phages protect against phages: superinfection of bacteria is prevented by CRISPR/Cas RNA originating from previous infections. the promoter regions were analyzed for their contribution to cancer by activating neighboring genes \u2013 as a consequence of a former retrovirus infection. activated cellular genes by \u201cdownstream promotion\u201d were identified in animal studies with activation of the myc gene as one of many examples, leading to chronic, not acute development of cancer. RNA viruses such as Bornaviruses have been shown to integrate by illegitimate reverse transcription. both of them are associated with gene reduction. this phenomenon may play a role for evolution of viruses from autonomous to parasitic lifestyles. reductive evolution of endosymbionts can yield bacteria with tiny genomes. their genomes are 1.11 mio bp in length with about 834 protein-coding genes. cyanobacteria are considered as the major symbionts. oncogenes were in most cases taken up by the retroviruses at the expense of structural (gag), replicating (pol) or envelope (env) genes, and are often expressed as fusion proteins with Gag. they need the supply of replicatory genes in trans from co-infecting helper viruses to infect other cells. only a minority of viruses are pathogens; most do not cause diseases. RNA viruses are most important as drivers of evolution, as transmitters of genetic material, as innovative agents. some of them are pathogenic and dangerous, such as viroids in plants. some fossil life can be partially reproduced in vitro by Spiegelman\u2019s Monster and Eigen\u2019s follow-up experiments. the scenario described here focuses on viruses as drivers of evolution. the early RNA world gained interest 20\u201330 years ago."}
