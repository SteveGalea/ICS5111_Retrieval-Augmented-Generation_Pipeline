{"summary": "maternal-to-child transmission (MTCT) is the main cause of HIV-1 infection in children worldwide. MTCT of HIV-1 can occur during pregnancy (in utero, IU), at delivery (intrapartum, IP) and via breastfeeding (postpartum, postpartum, IP) HIV-1 can cross the placental barrier in utero either by microtransfusion or by transcytosis across the trophoblast cell layer [2]. IP transmission may occur through direct contact between infant mucosa and HIV-1 infected maternal blood and/or cervico-vaginal secretions. high maternal viral loads in serum and breast milk and low CD4 cell count have been correlated with increased risk of MTCT of HIV-1 [2], [3]. DC-SIGN gene variants modulate DC-SIGN expression in placental macrophages, promote HIV-1 capture and transmission to T cells and increase risk of MTCT among Zimbabwean infants. ART prophylaxis for HIV-1-positive antenatal women was not available in the Harare public-sector during ZVITAMBO patient recruitment. ms were determined using the HaploBlockFinder software with a minor allele frequency over 5% [24]. htSNPs were selected corresponding to the 10 major haplotypes from the 20 SNPs (rs number in Table S1) found in the Zimbabwean population as we previously described [23] pcDNA3-DC-SIGN exon 4 was amplified from genomic DNA of variants carriers and replaced between PspI and EspI (Fermantas, Burlington, Canada) restriction sites. all recombinants clones were verified by DNA sequencing for the presence of mutations of interest. CD4+ T-lymphocytes isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells were added. cells were cultivated in RPMI 10% FBS 100 U/ml rIL-2 for 5 days. supernatants were collected and p24 was measured using ELISA. placental mononuclear cells were cryopreserved until flow cytometry analysis. cells from 4 wild-type (WT) p-336T/p-201C and 11 homozygote or heterozygote p-336C/p-201A infants for the promoter variants born to HIV-1-negative mothers were analysed. change geometric MFI represents the difference between specific marker expression and its FMO (fluorescence minus one) Flow cytometry was performed using a BD LSR-Fortessa (BD Biosciences) OR (95% CI) % (n) OR (95% CI) % (n) OR (95% CI) % (n) OR (95% CI) % (n) OR (95% CI) P valuec P valuec H1 Absentb 80 (159) 84 (86) 1.0 86 (19) 1.0 94 (32) 1.0 Present 20 (39) 16 (16) 0.76 (0.40\u20131.44) 14 (3) 0.64 (0.18\u20132.29) 6 (2) 0.25 (0 H7 Absent 93 (185) 95 (97) 1.0 95 (21) 1.0 100 (34) Present 7(13) 5 (5) 0.73 (0.25\u20132.12) 5 (1) 0.67 (0.08\u20135.45) 0 NA 0.790 1.00 CI, Confidence interval; n, number; NA, non applicable, OR, odds ratio. a wild-type (referent category for all analyses) vs homozygote + heterozygote for each htSNPs. a P-value as determined by Fisher\u2019s exact test. Ethics Statement Written informed consent obtained from all mothers who participated in the study. MTCT of HIV in whole ZVITAMBO cohort occurred during IU (22,9%), IP (48%) and PP periods (29.1%) MTCT of HIV in whole ZVITAMBO cohort occurred during the IU (22,9%), IP (48%) and PP periods (29.1%) pcDNA3-DC-SIGN vector was co-transfected with constitutive expressor of Renilla luciferase, phRL-CMV. mutagenesis was carried out using pcDNA3-DC-SIGN vectors. all recombinants clones were verified by DNA sequencing. cells were incubated 2 h at 37\u00b0C and washed with PBS. cells were lysed and assayed for p24 Ag using ELISA. all infants were delivered vaginally except for two who were delivered by caesarean section. none of the mothers presented with signs of sexually transmitted infections. placentas with signs of inflammation (chorioamnionitis) were excluded. Dead cells stained with Live/Death Aqua and lineage cells stained with CD3-, CD19- and CD56-PerCPCy5.5 antibodies were excluded. placental macrophages were initially gated for CD14 expression and high granularity. change geometric MFI represents the difference between specific marker expression and its FMO (fluorescence minus one) luciferase DC-SIGN/HLA-DR/CD68 expression, capture and transmission assays comparisons were assessed with the unpaired two-tailed Student\u2019s t test. child DC-SIGN haplotypes and intrauterine (IU), intrapartum (IP) and postpartum (PP) HIV-1 transmission. 0.0025 0.110 0.067 H5 Absent 94 (187) 88 (90) 1.0 95 (21) 1.0 88 (30) 1.0 Present 6 (11) 12 (12) 2.27 (0.96\u20135.33) 5 (1) 0.81 (0.09\u20136.59) 12 (4) 2.27 (0.68\u20137.59) 0.066 1.00 0.250 H6 Absent 91 (180) 80 (82) 1.0 82 (18) 1.0 79 (27) 1.0 Present 9 (18) 20 (20) 2.44 (1 a wild-type (referent category for all analyses) vs homozygote + heterozygote for each htSNPs. b P-value as determined by Fisher\u2019s exact test. c Adjusted for the maternal viral load in logistic regression analysis. 197 infants born to ART-naive HIV-1-infected mothers recruited in Harare, Zimbabwe. 97 were HIV-1-infected and 100 were uninfected. 57 were infected IU, 11 IP, and 17 PP. promoter p-201A (rs11465366) and exon 4 198Q (rs41374747) variants are found exclusively in H6 while exon 4 198Q (rs41374747) variant tag H4 (Figure 1B) both H4 and H6 haplotypes harbour promoter variant p-336C (rs4804803) that is known to influence DC-SIGN promoter activity [25] and increased risk of HIV-1 parenteral infection [ DC-SIGNR promoter p-198A and intron 2 180A variants were significantly associated with increased risk of MTCT. p-336C decreased the transcriptional activity of Sp1 binding site. luciferase activity of the p-336C/p-201C variant construct was lower than that of WT p-336T/p-201C. p-201A variant either alone or in combination with p-336C significantly reduced DC-SIGN transcriptional activity in vitro. expression of the DC-SIGN promoter constructs was calculated relative to this value. results are mean S.E.M. values of three independent experiments performed in triplicates. Hofbauer cells were analysed by flow cytometry after isolation of mononuclear cells from term placentas of promoter WT p-336T/p-201C. p-336C or p-336C/p-201A carriers expressed significantly higher levels of DC-SIGN, HLA-DR and CD68 compared to CD163 cells. levels of DC-SIGN expression were reduced 1.9-fold (P = 0.0091) in CD163+ cells. levels of DC-SIGN expression were reduced 3.2-fold (P = 0.0402) by CD163+ cells. p-336C and p-201A altered DC-SIGN expression in placental Hofbauer cells. the 21Q variants were stably transfected and cell lines grown from a single clone. the stable Raji transfectants were pulsed with equal amount of R5 tropic HIV-1HXBRU-ADA or HIV-1JRCSF strains extensively washed. the number of virions used was not saturating since capture increased in a dose-dependent manner. cubated with DC-SIGN antibody failed to transmit HIV-1 to CD4+ T lymphocytes. cell infection was not due to viral particles shed into the supernatant. DC-SIGN neck variants enhance HIV-1 capture and transmission. Raji-transfectants were pulsed as in (C) and co-cultivated with activated human primary CD4+T lymphocytes from two donors for 5 days. cells were pre-incubated with AZN-D1. 97 were HIV-1-infected and 100 were uninfected. NPs from the 20 SNPs corresponding to the 10 major DC-SIGN haplotypes previously described among Zimbabweans were genotyped in the study samples. infants carrying H4 or H6 haplotypes had increased risk of IU HIV-1-infection, whereas H2 haplotype carriers were less likely to be infected during pregnancy compared to infant noncarriers. a step-wise logistic regression analysis included all DC-SIGN associated SNPs and maternal viral load. maternal viral load (OR: 3.30, 95% CI: 1.48\u20137.37, P = 0.0033) were independent predictors of HIV-1 IU acquisition. 1.4, 1.51\u201331.7, P = 0.0119) variants remained associated with increased risk of IU transmission. DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR are independent predictors of IU of HIV-1. H2 carries two promoter variants, p-939T and p-139C, that differ from WT H1 haplotype. the promoter variants p-939T and p-139C did not show any influence on DC-SIGN transcriptional activity in vitro. fluorescence intensity (MFI) of DC-SIGN, HLA-DR and CD68 expression was compared between both subsets for infants bearing or not promoter variants. results in C and D are mean S.E.M. values of MFI and difference between subsets or variants was calculated with Student\u2019s t test. Hofbauer cells were analysed by flow cytometry after isolation of mononuclear cells from term placentas of promoter WT p-336T/p-201C and variants p-336C/p-201A carriers. CD14+ cells of high granularity that were negative for T, B and NK cell markers were identified as Hofbauer cells (CD14+ population) exon 4 protein-modifying variants associated with IU HIV-1 infection could affect the interaction between DC-SIGN and HIV-1. exon 4 was replaced by exon 4 from infants carrying WT, 242V or 198Q, 214D and 221Q variants. transmission was quantified by measuring HIV-1 p24 in the supernatants after 5 days. DC-SIGN variants significantly increased viral transmission to CD4+ T lymphocytes. antibody titration was achieved at the same dilution for all cell lines using two DC-SIGN monoclonal antibodies that recognized different epitopes. Raji-transfectants were incubated with HIV-1HXBru-ADA (ADA) or HIV-1JRCSF (JRCSF) for 2 h at 37\u00b0C, extensively washed and lysed. cells were pre-incubated with anti-DC-SIGN (AZN-D1) or little is currently known about the mechanisms underlying HIV-1 passage across the placenta. the identification of natural and functional DC-SIGN genetic variants associated with an increased risk of IU HIV-1 infection further support the implication of DC-SIGN in HIV-1 dissemination across the placenta. in infants with the WT sequence, levels of DC-SIGN expression were significantly lower in infants born from HIV-1-positive mothers than those born from HIV-1-negative mothers. however, the impact of HIV-1 was negligible or not noticeable in infants carrying the promoter variants. in placenta, placental macrophages have compartmentalized HIV-1 replication. this could be the manifestation of HIV-1 placental adaptation to the unique repertoire of cellular targets and increased adherence to C-type lectins. however, the net impact of this phenomenon on MTCT of HIV-1 remains to be determined. these findings raise the possibility that similar mechanisms may operate with other human pathogens known to interact with DC-SIGN. aHaplotypes found at a frequency above 5% in the study population. 3105 cells were exposed to 150 ng of p24-equivalent of HIV-1HXBru-ADA for 2 h at 37\u00b0C, washed and incubated in fresh medium at 37\u00b0C for different time points. cells were pre-incubated 30 min at 4\u00b0C with 20 g/ml of anti-DC-SIGN (AZND1) or with mannan (200 g/ml) 242V, R198Q and WT (DOCX)."}
