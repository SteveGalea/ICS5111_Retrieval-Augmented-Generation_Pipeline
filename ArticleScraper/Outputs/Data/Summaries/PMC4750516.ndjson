{"summary": "the inclusion of ethical principles in pandemic planning can help enhance voluntary cooperation based upon public trust, and reduce undesirable outcomes of public health measures. the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in the Republic of Korea has led to few ethical discussions. international guidelines on ethics and pandemic planning strongly recommend pandemic plans be clearly founded on ethical values shared and affirmed by the public. if pandemics engender uncertain, dangerous, and fearful situations, ethical issues inevitably arise with regard to public health measures against pandemics. the second principle is proportionality, or of the least restrictive means. the third principle is that of reciprocity. if individuals sacrifice their liberties for the common good of the society, the society has reciprocal obligations. critics of individualistic approaches to public health ethics have proposed alternative perspectives on the ethics of infectious diseases. critics of individualistic approaches to public health ethics have proposed alternative perspectives on the ethics of infectious diseases. this approach focuses on relational personhood and relational autonomy. view also helps avoid stigmatization and scapegoating, and provides for the humane care of infected patients including end-of-life care. some ethical principles have been embodied tacitly, if not explicitly, by the Korean government in public health policies and practices during and after the MERS-CoV outbreak. the public health authorities in Korea failed to uphold this ethical principle from the beginning. a lack of transparency from the government in the early stage of the epidemic worsened the public\u2019s mistrust of the government. fear and stigmatization of quarantined residents and even of the families of health care workers occurred frequently. authors have suggested pandemic planning enriched with ethical principles. pandemic planning enriched with ethical principles will facilitate efficiency, voluntariness, and legitimacy."}
