{"summary": "the 2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak in the Republic of Korea began with an imported case (1) and spread across the country with a total of 186 cases. the situation was compounded by the unique health-care settings in the Republic of Korea, including crowded emergency departments. the IHR Emergency Committee concluded that this MERS outbreak in the Republic of Korea did not constitute a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. experts from Saudi Arabia shared MERS patient care experience with experts of the Republic of Korea. experts concluded that the adjusted case fatality ratio was similar for the two countries. the ministry of health and welfare reacted immediately by creating the MERS portal web site (9) and multilanguage, toll-free telephone hotline services for timely disease information sharing and effective risk communications. internet searches for MERS peaked during the week of the Republic of Korea\u2013WHO Joint Mission and decreased substantially thereafter. combating infectious diseases should be encouraged in future outbreaks."}
