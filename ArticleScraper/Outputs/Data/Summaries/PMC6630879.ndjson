{"summary": "SEOV is associated with brown (Rattus norvegicus) and black rats (Rattus rattus) as its reservoir. the respiratory route is considered the main route of transmission from rats to humans. transmission between rats has also been associated with wounding through biting and/or scratching. animal studies Sixty rats (Rattus norvegicus) were collected from a feeder farm linked to a human case of SEOV infection previously described. a human SEOV ELISA (Hantavirus Dobrava/Hantaan IgG Elisa) was used as conjugate at a 1:5000 dilution. RNA isolation was performed on blood (200 L), urine (200 L), saliva and rectal swabs using a QIAamp Viral RNA kit. rat -actin control was used as an amplification control by conventional RT-PCR. only animals with samples positive for -actin were included. serial sections of representative tissues were simultaneously cut and stained for presence of SEOV nucleoprotein (N protein) by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using a mouse anti-SEOV N protein monoclonal antibody at a dilution of 1:400. a goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase followed by aminoethyl carbazole and a haematoxylin counterstain. animal studies Sixty rats (Rattus norvegicus) were collected from a feeder farm linked to a human case of SEOV infection previously described. animals were euthanized by means of exsanguinations under sedation. RNA isolation was performed on blood (200 L), urine (200 L), saliva and rectal swabs using a QIAamp Viral RNA kit. all samples were tested by a SEOV\u2013specific real-time RT-PCR as previously described. immunohistochemistry (IHC) using a mouse anti-SEOV N protein monoclonal antibody at a dilution of 1:400. a goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase followed by aminoethyl carbazole and a haematoxylin counterstain. several sections of representative tissues were additionally cut and stained for IHC with an antibody against CD31 (RnD systems) results 3.1. Clinical Signs In general, rats had a good body condition score, but many animals had a poor coat condition, but many animals had a poor coat condition. four juveniles died from unknown reasons before they could be euthanized and were excluded from the study. five adult animals showed lesions varying from enlarged bronchial lymph nodes (n = 2), enlarged spleen (n = 1), petechiae on the salivary gland (n = 1) to penile prolapse, empty gastrointestinal tract and blood from nose during anesthesia (n = 1). lungs and airways including tracheas showed neither marked inflammation nor SEOV-IHC positive epithelial cells. liver parenchyma shows a blood vessel (b) with a mild perivascular lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate (asterisk) and surrounding air-filled alveoli (a) with a polymorphonuclear leukocyte (arrowhead) in an alveolar septum. compared to serial section (B) showing positive endothelial cells\u2019 cytoplasm for SEOV-antigen. thelial cell cytoplasm for SEOV-antigen was compared to serial section (I) corroborating endothelial cells by positive CD31-antigen expression (arrows). the number of PMNs present within the pulmonary alveolar interstitial tissues were counted and compared with viral infection (Figure 2A). the endothelial cell origin of the infected cells was corroborated by additional IHC staining of representative kidney tissues with an antibody against CD31 a marker for endothelial cells. the number of PMNs present within 25 renal glomeruli per animal were counted and compared with infection status. the number of PMNs present within the hepatic parenchyma and sinusoids was significantly higher in SEOV infected animals compared to non-infected animals. however, there is a difference in age between the two groups, we also performed analysis between adult animals that were positive for SEOV RNA in liver versus those that were negative. SEOV RNA could primarily be detected in the lungs of all adult rats (19/19), but also in the kidneys in 79% (15/19), liver in 74% (14/19) and the blood in 74% (14/19) of the rats. rRT-PCR of 30 rats: 20 seropositive rats, including 1 juvenile, and 10 seronegative rats. several lungs showed extensive granular cytoplasmic positive IHC staining for SEOV of especially interstitial endothelial cells of alveolar septal capillaries. the endothelial cell origin was corroborated by additional IHC staining of serial lung slides with an antibody against CD31. kidney parenchyma centrally shows a cross-section of a thick-walled arteriole, partly filled with erythrocytes, with a mild juxtavascular lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate. compared to serial section (E) showing positive endothelial cells\u2019 cytoplasm for SEOV-antigen. a comparison of age-matched SEOV positive and negative animals from the same population was not possible. a comparison of histological scoring of samples stained with haematoxylin & eosin (HE) was performed between adult animals that were seropositive (SEOV +) and juvenile animals that were seronegative (SEOV ; (A)) livers showed granular cytoplasmic positive IHC staining of especially endothelial cells lining the sinusoids. the number of PMNs present within the hepatic parenchyma and sinusoids was significantly higher in SEOV infected animals compared to non-infected. persistent SEOV infection of the liver in rats primarily targets the microvasculature. results in mild yet obvious inflammation consistent with a pathological diagnosis of a mild hepatitis. lungs and airways including tracheas showed neither marked inflammation nor SEOV-IHC positive epithelial cells. panel photomicrographs of lung (A\u2013C), kidney (D\u2013F) and liver (G\u2013I) of naturally infected rats with Seoul virus. positive antigen expression is visualized as finely-granular reddish-brown staining by AEC-immunoperoxidase, on Haematoxylin counterstain. compared to serial section (E) showing positive endothelial cells\u2019 cytoplasm for SEOV-antigen (arrows) compared to serial section (F) corroborating endothelial cells by positive CD31-antigen expression (arrows) the error bars represent the standard deviation of the mean (* = p 0.05, Student\u2019s t-test). kidneys showed neither marked inflammatory lesions nor SEOV IHC positive epithelial cells. lymphoplasmacytic aggregates of mild to moderate cellularity were present in hepatic portal areas and surrounding central veins of several but not all infected animals. the endothelial cell origin of the infected cells was corroborated by additional IHC staining of representative liver tissues with an antibody against CD31 a marker for endothelial cells. analysis of SEOV cell tropism in key target organs following natural infection of a cohort of feeder rats associated with a human case of SEOV infection in the Netherlands. rats were inoculated via a route which does not recapitulate virus transmission in nature. SEOV infection causes subclinical, acute, and focal hemorrhage and edema in the lungs. in experimental rats, only mild inflammation was observed in lungs of some SEOV infected adult rats but not in uninfected juvenile rats. this observed difference in severity of histopathological changes could be due to the route of infection. limited information on SEOV infection in the liver of reservoir species has been reported. this included acute viral hepatitis-like manifestations with lobular necrosis without viral inclusions, atypical cells, vasculitis, or fibrosis. this suggests that SEOV may have a tropism for liver in both reservoir and diseased host."}
