{"summary": "Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is the causative agent of porcine circovirus-associated disease (PCVAD) the disease is characterized by weight loss, respiratory or digestive disorders, reproductive failure, and enlarged lymph nodes with lymphocyte depletion. the unfolded protein response (UPR) is a series of adaptive mechanisms known as the unfolded protein response (UPR) when cells are overwhelmed due to prolonged stress, UPR leads to intrinsic mitochondrial apoptosis. there is a complex relationship between host cells and virus infection with regard to UPR and apoptosis. a flexible peptide linker GGSGG was introduced between ORF3 and EGFP. the orf1 and orf2 genes were amplified from the genomic DNA of the PCV2 and subcloned into pcDNA3.1-Flag. all of the constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. transfection Each of the recombinant plasmids was delivered into PK-15 cells by transfection with lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for RNA interference, siPERK was delivered into the cells by transfection 24 h prior to transfection of the cells with p-Rep-Flag or p-Cap-Flag. the cells were cubated for another hour with goat anti-rabbit, anti-mouse or donkey anti-goat horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibodies. images were captured by the Gel 3100 Chemiluminescent and Fluorescent Imaging System. the genes orf3 and egfp were polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified from the genomic DNA of the PCV2 isolate SY4 (PCV2b, GenBank accession No. GU325754) and the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1-EGFP (Invitrogen, Eugene, Oregon, USA) with gene-specific primers. transfection Each of the recombinant plasmids was delivered into PK-15 cells by transfection with lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for RNA interference, siPERK was delivered into PK-15 cells by transfection 24 h prior to transfection of the cells with p-Rep-Flag or p-Cap-Flag. all antibodies were found to react with target molecules from porcine cell lines used in this study. blots were revealed using the ECL Plus detection system. images were captured by the Gel 3100 Chemiluminescent and Fluorescent Imaging System. expression of Rep or Cap caused significant elevation of the phosphorylated form of PERK and eIF2 over a time course of 12, 24, 36, and 48 h. the levels of total PERK and eIF2 remained unchanged. expressions of the fusion proteins Cap, Rep, and ORF3 were revealed by antibodies to Flag or EGFP 3.2. both Rep and Cap proteins led to increased expressions of ATF4 and CHOP starting from 24 to 48 hpt. p-Rep-Flag, p-Cap-Flag, or control vector were transfected. cells were harvested and subjected to Western blotting. if Rep or Cap would modulate activation of caspase-3. Cap, but not Rep, downregulated Bcl-2 and induced caspase-3 cleavage PK-15 cells were transfected with the p-Rep-Flag, p-Cap-Flag, or control vector for 24 h. the numbers below the blots \u201cBcl-2\u201d represent average densitometric ratios of Bcl-2 to (-actin of three independent experiments. transfection with siPERK showed a reduced level of caspase-3 cleavage. lower level of apoptotic response accorded with reduced expression of CHOP and increased expression of Bcl-2 as a result of PERK silencing. Rep and Cap, but not ORF3, induced unfolded protein response via PERK activation. pcDNA3.1-Flag, p-EGFP for pcDNA3.1-EGFP, p-ORF3-EGFP for pc. Western blotting was performed to visualize phosphorylated forms of PERK (p-PERK) and eIF2 (p-eIF2), total PERK (t-PERK) and total eIF2 (t-eIF2). expressions of the fusion proteins Cap, Rep, and ORF3 were revealed by antibodies to Flag or EGFP 3.2. Knockdown of PERK reduced Rep-or Cap-induced expressions of ATF4 and CHOP PK-15 cells were first transfected with PERK-specific siRNA (siPERK) the cells were harvested and subjected to Western blotting for phosphorylated forms of PERK (p-PERK), eIF2 (p-eIF2), total PERK (t-PERK), ATF4, CHOP, Flag, and (-actin) western blotting showed that Cap clearly induced caspase-3 cleavage from 24 to 48 hpt. such cleavage was barely detectable in Rep-expressing cells. this suggests that Cap, but not Rep, is the apoptosis inducer of PCV2. apoptosis is becoming increasingly recognized as an important molecular mechanism in a number of viral diseases such as Hepatitis C virus infection (Benali-Furet et al., 2005) and Influenza A virus infection (Roberson et al., 2012) we silenced PERK in Cap-expressing cells to elucidate its role in Cap-mediated apoptosis. western blotting of phosphorylated forms of PERK (p-PERK), total PERK (t-PERK), CHOP, Bcl-2, cleaved caspase-3 (c-caspase-3), Flag, and (-actin) the numbers below the blots represent average densitometric ratios of target molecules to (-actin of three independent experiments. chaperon GRP78 works as a sensor of unfolded proteins in the ER. it regulates the activation of ER stress transducers. PERK knockdown resulted in marked reduction of eIF2 phosphorylation. reduced Bcl-2 expression could be due to increased expression of CHOP. hepatitis C virus triggers apoptosis through induction of CHOP. bronchitis virus activates the eIF2-ATF4-CHOP pathway. both PCV2 Rep and Cap proteins could activate UPR by activating PERK. but only Cap-induced UPR led to apoptotic response via the PERK/eIF2/ATF4/CHOP/Bcl-2 pathway. further research would be to investigate whether these events would occur in PCV2 permissive cells of the pigs."}
