{"summary": "the MERSCoV genome is comprised of at least 10 putative open reading frames, including 2 that encode the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. the genome is comprised of at least 10 putative open reading frames, including 2 that encode the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. the S protein is involved in viral genome replication and modulation of cell signaling pathways. partial sequencing of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and N genes and BLAST analysis of the amplicon sequences were also performed. full length ORFs of the S (4042 nt) and N (1242 nt) protein genes were obtained by the centers for disease control and prevention (CDC), Atlanta, GA. the Greek-Saudi Arabia_2014 N differed by 0.1\u20130.9% nt and 0\u20130.8% aa from 69 other published MERS-CoV sequences. no unique nt changes were identified. two asterisks denote 3 additional identical S ORF sequences obtained from IFV. strains MERS-CoV/Jeddah_2014_C8826 and MERS-CoV/Jeddah_2014_C9055. RT-PCR and partial gene sequencing methods are more time consuming. a second serum specimen taken two weeks or more after onset of illness should also be tested. a genomic subpopulation in the swab sample possessed a unique amino acid substitution in S protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) the clustering of the Greek S and N ORFs with sequences from some dromedary camels was in accordance with recent findings. the ongoing outbreak of MERS-CoV suggests that the risk of importation of the virus in countries is expected to continue."}
