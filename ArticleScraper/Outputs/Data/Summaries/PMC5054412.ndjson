{"summary": "leishmania is an obligate intracellular parasite responsible for a broad spectrum of diseases, ranging from simple cutaneous to invasive visceral leishmaniasis (1). protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania present two forms in their life cycle: promastigote, which multiplies in the mid gut of the sand fly vector, and amastigote, the obligate intracellular form that lives within phagolysosomes of the verteb the CPs of L. mexicana are stage-regulated and the isoforms present differences in their substrate specificity and catalytic properties (7). despite trypanosomatid CPs may be instrumental in the survival of both promastigote and amastigote forms of these parasites. a key step in the design of subunit vaccines is the identification of epitopes from overlapping synthetic peptides. this method decreases the possibility of missed epitopes, but lots of peptides need to be synthesized at a high cost. overlapping nonamer peptides were selected from this dataset. most of the peptides were found to exhibit mono-supertype specificity. the highest number of supertypes a given nonamer could bind is 5 out of the 12 supertypes tested. no. of binding to the supertypes 339-HVSQSPTPG-347 CPB 5 9-FAIVVTILF-17 CPA 4 270-FMSYHSGVL-278 CPC 4 42-AEVNSKAKG-50 CPC 4 258-LTMQVYSDF-266 CPC 4 Knowing the number of binding peptides of each of the analyzed proteins is important. binding of predicted peptides to the 12 different HLA class I supertypes. the figure depicts the proportion of binding peptides to individual supertypes. the binding score of peptides to A1 locus supertypes is higher compared with CPB, CPA and other supertypes. a minimum conserved sequence length of 9 amino acids is required. regions that have identity 90% are shown with Roman numerals. the most conserved residues that appear in the consensus sequence are indicated by \u201c*\u201d. signal peptide of this protein predicted by SignalP 3.0 hidden Markov model (HMM) was excluded. hydrophilicity, flexibility, accessibility, turns, exposed surface, polarity and antigenic propensity scales were applied. one peptide binds to 5 supertypes, 4 bind to 4 supertypes, 9 bind to 3 supertypes and 44 bind to 2 supertypes. a given nonamer could bind Peptide sequence Protein No. of binding to the supertypes 339-HVSQSPTPG-347 CPB 5 9-FAIVVTILF-17 CPA 4 270-FMSYHSGVL-278 CPB 4 42-AEVNSKAKG-50 CPC the largest number of nonamers was found to be recognized by the allele B62 (53), followed by B58 (38), A2 (36), A24 (24), A1, B8 and B39 (21), B44 (20), A3 and B7 (19), B27 (17) and A26 (15), as illustrated in Figure 1. Observed variation in the binding of predicted peptides to the 12 different HLA class I supertypes studied. the number of immunogenic hotspots for CPA, CPB and CPC is 4, 5 and 0, respectively, as shown in Table 4.

HM prepared the manuscript. both authors read and approved the final manuscript. no competing interests exist. different scales were normalized where the original values of each scale were set between +3 and \u20133. hydrophilicity (41), flexibility (42), accessibility (43), turns (44), exposed surface (45), polarity (46) and antigenic propensity (47) scales were applied to predict B cell epitopes by BcePred server."}
