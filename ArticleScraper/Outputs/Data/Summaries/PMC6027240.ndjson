{"summary": "advancement in the field of genetic engineering has transformed our understanding of how genes underpin biological processes in health and disease states. the concept of \u201cpersonalized medicine\u201d has thus become a reality and various gene-manipulative technologies such as antisense methodologies have demonstrated \u201cproof-of-principle\u201d for treatment of rare genetic diseases. this is especially the case for neurodegenerative disorders where the tightly-regulated blood-brain barrier (BBB) prevents uptake of most pharmaceuticals. some of the most important for subsequent CPP iterations include: the transactivator of transcription from HIV (HIV-Tat) [5]; Penetratin-1, which is derived from the homeodomain of Antennapedia, a Drosophila transcription factor [6]; Transportan, a chimeric peptide derived from galanin and the wasp-venom peptide toxin mastoparan [7]; and cationic polyarginine RXRRBRRXR YQFLI RXRBRXRB SSO for DMD, SMA [13,14,15,16] M12 RRQPPRSISSHP SSO for DMD [17] Br-ApoE(KA) Ac-LRALRARLLRGGAc-LRALRARLLRGGKX-Bpg-G SSO for SMA [18] P4 LGAQSNF SSO (2OMe) for DMD [19],19 covalent conjugation occurs with a defined structure and stoichiometry between predominantly charge-neutral oligonucleotide chemistries. CPPs join covalently to the cargo antisense nucleic acid and then traverse the biological membranes through various peptide-mediated uptake mechanisms. PMOs consist of a morpholine ring in place of ribose and phosphorodiamidate linkages in place of phosphodiester. these compounds act primarily through steric blockage of complementary RNA sequences to either inhibit protein translation or to modify pre-mRNA splicing. the most promising results to date have been with arginine-rich peptides that contain aminohexanoic acid. arginine-rich B-peptide (B-PMO) demonstrated 50% wild-type dystrophin levels following a single 25 mg/kg dose [9] concurrent with partial restoration in cardiac function measures following dobutamine-mediated stress induction. weekly administration of PMO at 200 mg/kg for 12 weeks could only achieve 10% wild-type dystrophin levels [43] B-PMO has been used as a therapeutic strategy for targeting myotonic dystrophy type I. a systemic administration of B-PMO targeting this repeat element blocked Mbnl1 sequestration. this resulted in widespread aberrant splicing abnormalities. a pip6-PMO was used to investigate the pharmacodynamics of this approach. iterations of core design, namely Pip6 series of peptides, showed variable levels of activity that suggested a minimal core sequence length is required to maintain activity. other novel CPPs have been developed for muscle targeting including M12 identified through phage display performed on C2C12 myoblasts. a paralogous gene, SMN2, encodes SMN protein but only produces low levels due to a sequence variant that results in exclusion of exon 7 from 90% of mature transcript. a strategy of employing 2\u2032-O\u2019methoxyethyl SSOs (Nusinersen) to target an intronic silencing element to promote inclusion of exon 7 in the SMN2 gene has recently been clinically approved. a branched chain peptide induced a 0.25-fold increase in exon 7 inclusion in the spinal cord and to a lesser extent in the brain. conjugation to negatively-charged nucleic acids such as siRNAs and 2\u2032-O-Me ASOs results in electrostatic interactions that can self-aggregate and potentially interfere with oligonucleotide target binding. a single CPP-PMO construct has been used to simultaneously target two genes using a single CPP. a second PMO through either \u201cclick\u201d chemistry or a disulfide linker allowed two PMOs to be delivered by a single CPP with similar splice-switching activity. CPP-ASO approaches have also been developed as antibacterial agents. a modified version of this peptide, MPG-8, was used to deliver siRNA targeting the cell cycle regulator cyclin B1 in a xenograft tumor mouse model. the molar ratio of cargo to peptide was found to be a crucial determinant of efficacy, with optimal efficacy achieved at an MPG-8/siRNA molar ratio of 20/1. retro-inverso peptides consist of D-amino acids in reverse sequence of naturally occurring L-isoforms. this peptide had similar siRNA-mediated knockdown efficacy to parent CADY-K nanoparticles but with the advantage of improved resistance to enzymatic and serum degradation of siRNA cargo. another approach to CPP-mediated siRNA delivery has been the development of branched histidine-lysine polymers [60]. pepfect6 siRNA complexes induced potent target gene knockdown of 60\u201375% in kidney, lung, and liver organs following a single dose of 1 mg/kg with no apparent acute toxicity. further iterations of this peptide through modification of the TP10 sequence (PepFect14) were also effective for multiple nucleic acid cargoes in vitro [27,28] and most interestingly could demonstrate that it could retain activity after being dried as a administration of 50 g of RVG-9R siRNA complexes into wild-type mice was able to induce approximately 50% reduction in Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase levels in the brain but not in spleen and liver. this approach was used in a mouse model of fatal flaviviral encephalitis with 80% survival in RVG-9R treated mice compared to control peptide-siRNA groups who all died within 10 days. a fusion peptide, termed 599, could induce significant target-gene silencing and subsequent decrease in cell invasiveness in an oral cancer cell model. a fusion peptide, termed 599, consisting of a synthetic influenza virus-derived fusogenic domain and a cationic arginine domain, could induce significant target-gene silencing and subsequent decrease in cell invasiveness. accumulation of lytic CPPs at the cell surface, primarily through electrostatic interaction, forms a localized \u201ccarpet\u201d leading to reorganization of the lipid membrane. the \u201cbarrel-pore\u201d model describes the formation of transmembrane channels that are formed due to insertion of amphipathic -helices peptides. the hydrophilic surface faces inwards, thus forming an aqueous pore. cationic conjugates relied on micropinocytosis, while amphipathic conjugates used clathrin-mediated endocytosis. endocytic pathways for each CPP class are highly dependent on properties of the cargo, relative concentration, and the cell line/tissue being targeted. a clear example of this is for Pip6A-PMO, whereby caveolae-mediated endocytosis is primarily responsible for uptake in skeletal muscle cells ligands that modulate autophagy were coadministered with PF14-SSO in a luciferase splice-switching reporter system. autophagy induction and colocalization with autophagosomes was confirmed by confocal microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. majority of CPPs are thought to be taken up through energy-dependent endocytic internalization. researchers are actively pursuing bioengineering methods such as fusogenic lipids [87] for early escape from endosomes to the cytosol. the incorporation of pH-sensitive domains into the CPP has been used to destabilize lipid membranes under the acidic pH conditions in the endosome to aid escape. lysomotropic moieties have also been used to successfully improve endosomal escape. there are advantages and disadvantages to developing covalent and noncovalent approaches for clinical application of CPP-ASO delivery. the advantages are that a clearly defined entity is produced that has high reproducibility and generally has a low molar ratio of CPP-to-ASO cargo (typically 1:1) a higher molar ratio of CPP:ASO from 5:1 to 20:1 is required for optimal efficacy. safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacokinetics, and therapeutic index are major factors to be considered for nucleic acid delivery. in vivo assessment of CPP-ASO toxicology has not been robustly reported. one of the potential advantages of CPP-based approaches over viral-based delivery is the opportunity for readministration. nonhuman primates were administered once-weekly IV for 4 weeks of 9 mg/kg of (RXRRBR)2 peptide conjugated PMO. at this dose, mild tubular degeneration was detected in the kidneys. however, at this dose, mild tubular degeneration was detected in the kidneys."}
