{"summary": "despite current knowledge of mutations in 45 genes that can cause nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), no unified clinical test has been developed that can comprehensively detect mutations in multiple genes. we therefore designed Affymetrix resequencing microarrays capable of resequencing 13 genes mutated in SNHL. findings provide insight into critical issues for disease-centered resequencing protocols suitable for clinical application. genetic testing can also predict the absence or onset of a syndrome for which the other clinical problems may not be present at birth or early childhood. it is uncertain what genetic mutations are the next most prevalent in patients with hearing loss. current technology allows for widespread screening of only the most common genes related to SNHL (i.e. GJB2). the efficiency of sequence-specific hybridization is dependent on the properties of the probe and target sequences. high GC-content, presence of a nearby SNP and cross-hybridizing sequences are known to affect base-calling. 80% of no-calls can be resolved by visual inspection of the intensities as one of the strands provides a clear signature for these positions. average base call rate across 26 arrays (654,862 bases) was 96.9% using Affymetrix GDAS 2.0. 57 variants were called per array but only 28% were true variants. dideoxy sequencing of 352,618 bases across 14 arrays was performed. 14 Harvard arrays with full dideoxy sequencing results were used for determination of false negatives and overall accuracy. no-calls and variant calls across all 26 Harvard arrays were used for call rates and false positive rates. no-calls were processed for the first 12 chips (short and long range PCR protocol) no-calls were converted to wild-type, left as no-call, or were assigned a variant call. chips that were analyzed only for no-calls may show an increase in false positive rate. dideoxy sequencing was performed for 336,171 of the bases and comparison of this data with array calls gave an array call accuracy of 99.83%. average number of false positives dropped from 180 to 42 per array. modified protocol with shorter PCR products was then adopted for subsequent arrays. we used complementary feature quartets to determine intensities associated with the C- or G-content of a probe. intensity characteristics varied differently with respect to an increase in C- or G-content. average peak intensity was affected more severely by a high G-content than an equally high C-content. the average call rate increased to 96.7% (99.82% call accuracy) the average number of no-calls dropped from 2350 to 902 per array. the number of false positives dropped from 180 to 44 bases per array. improvement was obtained at the cost of incorrectly assigning an additional 0.38 true variants per array as wild-type. a total of 411 true variants were detected across 26 Harvard arrays. the 10 missed variants represent a single common SNP (MYO7A 4755T>C) of the 411 variants, 44 represent rare variants, many of potential clinical significance. all 10 wild-type calls (false negatives) were due to a single repeatedly miscalled common benign variant in MYO7A (4755T>C; S1585S) after excluding synonymous and/or common variants, 18/37 patients examined by the Cincinnati array and 9/24 patients examined on the Harvard array had at least one variant of potential or likely clinical significance. we obtained an average base call accuracy of 99.82% across the 14 arrays. sPROFILER was applied to GDAS/GSEQ base calls. sPROFILER was applied to GSEQ. 14 Harvard arrays with full dideoxy sequencing results were used for determination of false negatives and overall accuracy. no-calls and variant calls across all 26 Harvard arrays were used for call rates and false positive rates. the Cincinnati array also contained 8 genes, 3 of which were common to the Harvard array. false negative calls with and without protocol optimization represented as a portion of true variants. the number of no-calls and false positives from the former were found to be higher. the impact of using shorter PCR products was evaluated by comparing array data across the two protocols. delG, 35delG/167delT, and M1V/167delT in GJB2 and homozygous 1180_1187del8ins(-sat) in TMPRSS3 were previously reported. we analyzed array data to look for no-calls or variant calls in the vicinity of the indel sites. however, there was a continuous stretch of 13 no-calls and a variant call spanning the deleted bases of the TM probes with same G-content produced lower peak intensities than probes with C-stretches. sPROFILER sPROFILER was only used on no-calls from GDAS/GSEQ. the average call rate increased to 99.6% (range 99.5% to 99.8%) with 99.88% call accuracy and number of no-calls dropped from 563 to 103. improvement was achieved at the cost of an additional 0.4 false negative per array. the basis of the poor sensitivity for this variant did not appear to be overall high GC-content, which was 52%, nor a local G/C stretch. of the 411 variants, 44 represent rare variants, many of potential clinical significance. 18/37 patients examined by the Cincinnati array and 9/24 patients examined on the Harvard array had at least one variant of potential or likely clinical significance. oligonucleotide microarrays provide an efficient and economically competitive method for genetic screening of heterogeneous disorders by allowing parallel resequencing of multiple genes in a single experiment. two resequencing microarrays containing 13 unique genes implicated in nonsyndromic SNHL. Array base calls were compared to dideoxy sequencing to determine accuracy. critical performance characteristics we tried to understand and optimize are call rate, sensitivity and specificity. amplification of long stretches of contiguous interrogated DNA enables the highest efficiency savings for long-range PCR approaches. amplification of long stretches of contiguous interrogated DNA enables the highest efficiency savings for long-range PCR approaches. sites interrogated with G-rich probes may show stronger signal on the complementary strand using C-rich probes. it has previously been suggested that probes with multiple Gs in a row tend to have higher cross-hybridization signals possibly caused by formation of G-quartets due to multiplex binding. small indels present challenges as they sometimes do not lead to easily discernible variability in hybridization patterns. new algorithmic and technical improvements could entail development of a scheme for detection of indels by virtue of identifying a regional drop in signal intensity. oligo hybridization based sequencing technology only for diseases in which most mutations are substitutions. 74 patient samples and clinical information were collected under IRB-approved protocols. most patients had previously tested negative for biallelic GJB2 mutations except for 3 patients who had heterozygous mutations in the GJB2 gene. initial set of genes were selected for inclusion on one or both hearing loss arrays (e.g. GJB2, GJB6, CDH23, KCNE1, KCNQ1, MYO7A, OTOF, USH1C, and TMPRSS3) due to space limitations only the most conserved portion of CDH23 was tiled. for all genes, both the coding sequence and splice junctions were assessed. for the Cincinnati array, 2 bp of each flanking splice site were tiled for most exons. for the Cincinnati array, 10 bp of each flanking splice site were tiled for most exons. PCR products were purified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to the array. the data were analyzed using the GeneChip DNA Analysis Software (GDAS) and the GeneChip Sequence Analysis Software (GSEQ 4.0, Affymetrix) cycle sequencing conditions are 94\u00b0C 4 min, (98\u00b0C 30 sec, 50\u00b0C 5 sec, 60\u00b0C 4 min) 30, 4\u00b0C. sPROFILER attempts to resolve no-calls based on intensity signature from a single strand. sPROFILER does not attempt to re-examine any base calls conforming to the reference sequence because GDAS and GSEQ are conservative in making wild-type calls. the filters were designed for reduction in false positives by screening variant calls that are in regions rich in variant calls and no-calls. the results were compared against sequencing results and against GDAS/GSEQ calls for validation. DNA and clinical information was collected on most patients. included demographic information, audiometric profiles, family history, neuro-otologic history and physical examinations. the Cincinnati array contained: GJB2, GJB6, CDH23 (59 out of 69 exons; 80.3% of the coding sequence), KCNE1, KCNQ1, MYO7A, OTOF, and SLC26A4 genes. for all genes, both the coding sequence and splice junctions were assessed. each array contained probes to interrogate roughly 26,000 bases of DNA. all PCR assays were quantified using PicoGreen or absorbance spectrometry. the PCR products were then purified, fragmented, labeled and hybridized to the array. after initial experience, the Cincinnati protocol was modified to include only short range PCR. sequence reactions are performed using the same primers for short-range PCR. cycle sequencing conditions are 94\u00b0C 4 min, (98\u00b0C 30 sec, 50\u00b0C 5 sec, 60\u00b0C 4 min) 30 min, 4\u00b0C. the algorithm uses all wild-type bases within the array to determine threshold for peak to next highest intensity ratio on either strand. the latter is used for scaling the threshold ratio and thus, in effect, making the algorithm more conservative while attempting to assign a wild-type call to a position that is being called variant in a large number of samples. SC performed all laboratory work and raw data analysis for the Harvard arrays. PK, JHG, BJA and HLR analyzed the resequencing data. all authors read and approved the final manuscript."}
