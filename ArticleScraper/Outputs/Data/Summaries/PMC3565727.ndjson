{"summary": "nanotechnology is a multi-disciplinary field, which can create materials and devices that can be applied to aerospace, medicine, information technology, agriculture and energy production. the aim of this review is to describe new methods of producing nanoscale assemblies and their characteristic features. a modified oil-in-water emulsion technique was used to fabricate poly(PDL-co-DO) copolyester nanoparticles that were encapsulated with an anticancer drug, doxorubicin (diox), or an oligonucleotide, siRNA. the poly(PDL-co-DO) copolyesters were being investigated as new materials for biomedical applications. PLGA nanoparticles encapsulated with siRNA showed target genes could be knocked down and tumour growth could be controlled in vivo. nanoparticles were created from poly(norbornene) diblock copolymers in which the minor block has a urea or urethane pendant group with an ureidopyrimidinone moiety. polymer nanocapsules were made of mixtures of poly(-caprolactone) and PLGA. the nanometre level was obtained as the proportion of PLGA added to the mixture increased. cationic polysaccharide is biodegradable, innately biocompatible and non-toxic to living tissues. cyclohexane-1,4-diylacetone dimethylene ketal (PCADK) microspheres are encapsulated with a hydrophobic drug to treat cardiac dysfunction. this in turn prevents a grave foreign-body response by the immune system. liposomes liposomes are lipid bilayer vesicles (figure 1e) liposomes consist of single or multiple concentric lipid bilayers with an internal aqueous core. liposomes are classified as unilamellar vesicles (50\u2013250 nm); when there are multiple bilayers, they are classified as multi-lamellar vesicles (500\u20135000 nm). liposomes are derived liposomes offer the extra advantages of biocompatibility, biodegradability, low toxicity and ability for surface and size modification. cyclic peptide molecule self-assembles into peptide nanotubes through hydrogen bonding interactions followed by further self-assembly into arrays of nanotubes. sembly of DNA molecules into shape of triangular prism that encapsulates six gold particles (yellow) liposomes loaded with the drug Dox have been clinically approved for cancer treatment. liposomes have generated interest in hybrid constructs. DNA has a diameter of approximately 2 nm, a short structural repeat of around 3.4\u20133.6 nm and a persistence length of about 50 nm. a 1.7 kb single-stranded DNA folded into an octahedral structure by a simple denaturation\u2013renaturation procedure. a folate\u2013chitosan\u2013DNA nanoparticle has been characterized. it has been shown to combine the biocompatibility of chitosan with increased transfection efficiency by using folic acid as a ligand for targeting cell membranes. the current DNA delivery systems are safe and versatile, but do not have the transfection yield of viruses. bioconjugation has been achieved using commercially available homo- or hetero-bifunctional linkers. for example, three foreign proteins were chemically conjugated to the surface of cowpea mosaic virus using appropriate bifunctional cross-linkers [34] there are different chemistries being used for bioconjugation. this synthesis platform allows the production of custom-designed VLP bioconjugates for biomedical applications. alphavirus-based virus-like replicon particles (VRP) expressing different antigens of melanoma differentiation antigen tyrosinase. they identified tyrosinase-related protein 2 (TRP-2) as the most potent antigen. ferritins are globular protein complexes that are vital to iron homeostasis. ferritin has an outer diameter of 12 nm and an inner cavity diameter of 8 nm. other types of nano-cage are mini-ferritins that have tetrahedral symmetry. ferritin accumulates in human plaque macrophages and iron oxide nanoparticles can be encapsulated in its cavity. ferritin accumulates in human plaque macrophages and iron oxide nanoparticles can be encapsulated in its cavity. oxysomes were first visualized by electron microscopy decades ago, they were thought to be viruses. a few thousand protein subunits form the shell with the basic building block being a hexameric unit. Pdu and Eut encapsulate many more enzymes than carboxysomes. protein nanoassemblies Proteins are biopolymers that have been used as versatile building blocks in the construction of nanosystems. no external catalysts are needed in construction as all the molecular information necessary for self-assembly is already found. elastin-like polypeptides (ELP) create a chimeric nanoparticle with a drug-rich core surrounded by a hydrophilic peptide corona. this creates a chimeric nanoparticle with a drug-rich core surrounded by a hydrophilic peptide corona. nanoparticles can induce nearly complete tumour regression after a single dose. spherical virus-inspired peptide nanoassemblies have been created by peptide self-assembly. the driving force for peptide self-assembly is the generation of an extensive network of intersubunit hydrogen bonds. peptide nanotubes can mimic artificial transmembrane ion channels. peptide nanofibres can be obtained from a modified amyloid- peptide (AAKLVFF) when assembly is done in water. peptide nanofibres can be obtained from a modified amyloid- peptide (AAKLVFF) -helices are -helices composed of a repetitive heptad amino acid sequence pattern (abcdefg)n. these -helices wind around each other in a supercoil. hydrophobic amino acids are often charged residues that form interhelical salt bridges. one of the helical axes each, as well as the two coiled-coil symmetry axes are shown. the calculated diameter is 23 nm. the view is down the fourfold symmetry axis of the octahedron. hydrogelating self-assembling fibres (hSAFs) differ from previous design by weaker interactions at residues exposed on the surface of coiled-coil assemblies. it must be pointed out that in drug delivery applications hydrogels suffer from the limitation of rapid drug release. boato et al. [98] designed and produced a spherical particle with a mean diameter of 17\u201320 nm. the basic building block was a designed self-assembling coiled-coil lipopeptide. the coiled-coil sequence was derived from a fragment of the F1 glycoprotein of respiratory syncytial virus, which has been shown to form a parallel three-helix bundle. the design is based on a single polypeptide chain that self-assembles into a protein nanoparticle. the icosahedron has twofold, threefold and fivefold symmetry axes. a pentameric coiled coil was genetically joined to a trimeric coiled coil (figure 2b) liposomes liposomes are lipid bilayer vesicles (figure 1e) they consist of single or multiple concentric lipid bilayers with an internal aqueous core. when there are multiple bilayers, they are classified as multi-lamellar vesicles (500\u20135000 nm) liposomes are derived from their hydrophobic outer shell and internal hydrophilic compartments. a linker of three glycines is used to separate the moieties. a cyclic peptide molecule self-assembles into nanotubes. the blue domain self-assembles into fibrils exposing the epitope (red) by means of a linker (green) liposomes have generated interest in hybrid constructs. these constructs could obtain multiple functionalities, such as therapeutics and diagnostics. thermodox is a thermally sensitive liposome loaded with Dox. a 1.7 kb single-stranded DNA folded into an octahedral structure by a simple denaturation\u2013renaturation procedure. another method for creating specific DNA structures is DNA origami. this method was pioneered in 2006 by Paul Rothemund from the California Institute of Technology. a folate\u2013chitosan\u2013DNA nanoparticle has been characterized. it has been shown to combine the biocompatibility of chitosan with increased transfection efficiency by using folic acid as a ligand for targeting cell membranes. it is likely that the integration of smart mechanisms of infection by viruses into forthcoming DNA delivery systems will allow these systems to function similar to viral DNA delivery. a cell-free protein synthesis platform and a one-step, direct conjugation scheme were used to synthesize VLPs with ligands, such as proteins and nucleic acids, attached to their surface. this synthesis platform allows the production of custom-designed VLP bioconjugates for biomedical applications such as vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics. gen tyrosinase-related protein 2 (TRP-2) showed potent therapeutic effect. first two preventive cancer vaccines are VLP based (anti-hepatitis B virus) first two preventive cancer vaccines are anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV) ferritin has an outer diameter of 12 nm and an inner cavity diameter of 8 nm. the iron cluster is located within the protein layer and has a dimension of 1\u20132 nm. other types of nano-cage are mini-ferritins that have tetrahedral symmetry. ferritin accumulates in human plaque macrophages and iron oxide nanoparticles can be encapsulated in its cavity. uchida et al. [51] incorporated multiple functionalities in ferritin by genetically engineering cell-specific targeting peptide on its exterior surface. this multi-functional ferritin protein cage shows potential as a novel diagnostic imaging agent. both Pdu and Eut have aldehydes as toxic intermediates in the metabolic pathways they are responsible for. it is thought that one of the functions of these BMCs is to limit cytosol exposure of aldehyde. Designed protein nanoassemblies Proteins are biopolymers that have been used as versatile building blocks in the construction of nanosystems. no external catalysts are needed in construction as all the molecular information necessary for self-assembly is already found in the proteins\u2019 three-dimensional structures. elastin-like polypeptides are made up of an ELP segment and a short Cys-rich segment. this creates a chimeric nanoparticle with a drug-rich core surrounded by a hydrophilic peptide corona. these nanoparticles can induce nearly complete tumour regression after a single dose. spherical virus-inspired peptide nanoassemblies have been created by peptide self-assembly. cyclic peptides are other peptide architectures created by peptide self-assembly. peptide nanofibres can be obtained from a modified amyloid- peptide (AAKLVFF) when assembly is done in water. peptide nanofibres can be obtained from a modified amyloid- peptide (AAKLVFF) when assembly is done in water [82]. -helices are -helices composed of a repetitive heptad amino acid sequence pattern (abcdefg)n. these -helices wind around each other in a supercoil. the amino acids located at positions e and g are often charged residues that form interhelical salt bridges. the calculated diameter is 23 nm. adapted from [85]. the view is down the fourfold symmetry axis of the octahedron. hSAFs support cell growth and differentiation. hydrogels suffer from the limitation of rapid drug release. nature creates fibres from collagen due to its triple-helix structure. boato et al. [98] designed and produced a spherical particle with a mean diameter of 17\u201320 nm. the basic building block was a designed self-assembling lipopeptide. the coiled-coil sequence was derived from a fragment of the F1 glycoprotein of respiratory syncytial virus, which has been shown to form a parallel three-helix bundle. a pentameric coiled coil was genetically joined to a trimeric coiled coil. the linker between them was only one/two glycine residues. identical copies of the protein chain self-assemble to produce the nanoparticle. at least 60 proteins are required to form a nanoparticle. cyclic peptide nanotubes are other peptide architectures created by peptide self-assembly. cyclic peptide subunits made up of alternating even numbers of d- and l-amino acid residues are the building blocks for stable, one-dimensional hollow cyclic peptide nanotubes. peptide nanofibres self-assemble to form -sheet-rich nanofibres. peptides with alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acid residues can also be functionalized by extending the sequence with B-cell and T-cell epitopes. coiled coils are -helices typically composed of a repetitive heptad amino acid sequence pattern (abcdefg)n (figure 2a) these -helices wind around each other in a supercoil. hydrophobic amino acids typically occupy positions a and d which create the hydrophobic core of the coiled coil. the woolfson group first described the design and creation of peptide nanofibres using -helical coiled coils by engineering specific charged interactions. the two complementary peptides are complementary leucine-zipper peptides, of de novo design. peptide amphiphile self-assembles into a nanofibre with both structural and biological properties of native collagen. this is of great importance in the field of tissue regeneration, as native collagen can lead to autoimmune reactions and pathogenic side effects. symmetry is a powerful tool that can be exploited to build peptide nanoparticles. coiled-coil bundles then self-assemble into nanoparticles by clustering the lipid chains. the design is inspired by the architecture of virus capsids and capsid-like protein cages. at least 60 protein chains are required to form a nanoparticle. each chain occupies an identical environment. we first used solid-phase peptide synthesis to obtain peptide chain. nanoparticles with a 16 nm diameter were formed. bacteriophage MS2 VLPs were chemically conjugated to a targeting peptide (SP94) that binds human hepatocellular carcinoma (hCC) this allowed for selective delivery of nanoparticles, chemotherapeutic drugs, siRNA cocktails and protein toxins to HCC. this allowed for selective delivery of nanoparticles, chemotherapeutic drugs, siRNA cocktails and protein toxins to HCC. novel cell-uptake selection strategy was developed to isolate specific prostate cancer internalizing aptamers. aptamers are short RNA or DNA oligonucleotides that fold into three-dimensional conformations with high binding affinity and specificity. in simple terms, in this novel cell-uptake selection strategy, an RNA library is incubated with normal cell lines. the body, drug resistance, concentration distribution and total accumulation of drug in target tissues, toxicity and antigenicity and lastly dose, dose rate and time schedule of administration. nanoscale assemblies being used in drug delivery are pH-responsive polymeric micelles. toxicity of the polymers used to make the micelles has been an issue. nanoparticles change size from 150 to 40 nm when illuminated with UV light. volume change is reversible and allows for spatio-temporal control of drug release and improved tissue penetration. bioimaging nanoscale assemblies serve as excellent scaffolds for loading of fluorescent dyes or other probes for in vitro or in vivo imaging. CPMV was fluorescently labelled with a variety of commercially available fluorescent dyes using N-hydroxysuccinimide ester chemistry. the fluorescent CPMV was injected into adult mice and chick embryos. it allowed the visualization of the vasculature and blood flow to a depth of 500 m. chimeric HIV VLPs allow protein to be tracked during assembly and transmission using live-cell imaging. chimeric VLPs are colloidal nanocrystals with unique optical properties. a complete literature survey on nanoscale assemblies would be beyond scope of this review. a number of prophylactic VLP-based vaccines are currently being commercialized worldwide. they are synthesized by covalently conjugating self-antigens to VLPs to induce autoantibody responses. a peptide derived from angiotensin II was synthesized by solid-phase chemistry. the peptide nanoparticles functionalized with a fragment of the circumsporozoite protein of rodent malaria-causing agent Plasmodium berghei (figure 2e) were functionalized with a fragment of the circumsporozoite protein of rodent malaria-causing agent Plasmodium berghei. the peptide nanoparticles functionalized with a fragment of the circumsporozoite protein of rodent malaria-causing agent Plasmodium berghei ( antibodies were able to protect mice for up to 15 months against a second challenge after an initial challenge had successfully been cleared. the SAPN platform was employed for avian influenza (figure 2f) immunization. cell targeting is aimed at achieving high uptake of therapeutic and/or diagnostic reagent in a preferential location such as a tumour and high tumour to blood/normal tissue ratio. targeting can also be accomplished using proteins (mainly antibodies and their substructures), peptides, nucleic acids (aptamers), small molecules or vitamins and carbohydrates. simian virus 40 VLPs have gained attention in gene delivery due to their low toxicity and high stability in the blood. a novel cell-uptake selection strategy was developed to isolate specific prostate cancer internalizing aptamers. emblies are useful for encapsulation of anticancer chemotherapeutics, immunotherapeutics or nucleic acids. vault nanocapsules have hollow cavities that can be used as carrier of the lymphoid chemokine CCL21 [108] after a single intra-tumoural administration in mice, these CCL21-carrying vaults inhibit lung cancer growth. redox-responsive polymeric nanoparticles were prepared using a new disulphide bond-containing redox-sensitive polymer, poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(lactic acid) [110] nanoparticles were rice shaped using an optimized oil-in-water emulsion/solvent-evaporation method. the polymeric carrier itself had low cytotoxicity. nanoparticles are another type of smart nanocarrier system. bioimaging nanoscale assemblies serve as excellent scaffolds for loading of fluorescent dyes or other probes for in vitro or in vivo imaging. high local concentrations of dyes and/or probes are obtained, as they can be loaded onto the surface of the nanoassembly or inside its hollow interior. fluorescent chimeric VLPs of canine parvovirus were expressed in insect cells. enhanced GFP was genetically engineered onto the N-terminus of the viral protein VP2. the attachment of GFP did not disturb self-assembly or susceptibility to infection. VLPs are attractive because they are considered safe. there is no risk of disease in vaccinated individuals because they lack the genomic material needed for the replication and hence the spread of the virus. however, when used as vaccines VLPs also have limitations. ophage Q VLP capsid was administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats. the angiotensin II vaccine resulted in decreased blood pressure. one advantage of such vaccine treatment in humans would be better patient compliance. the peptide nanoparticles functionalized with a fragment of the circumsporozoite protein of rodent malaria-causing agent Plasmodium berghei (figure 2e) were able to protect mice for up to 15 months against a second challenge. the SAPN platform was employed for avian influenza (figure 2f) immunization. the SAPNs\u2019 feature of a repetitive antigen display system can be used not only for vaccination but also to elicit an immune response against poor antigens. by genetically engineering actin sequences from the highly conserved \u2018hydrophobic loop\u2019 onto the peptide nanoparticles and then immunizing mice. a peptide derived from angiotensin II was synthesized by solid-phase chemistry and was chemically conjugated to the RNA bacteriophage Q VLP capsid. the angiotensin II vaccine was administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats and resulted in decreased blood pressure. respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was repetitively displayed on the SAPN in its native trimeric conformation. the epitope selected was a coiled coil too, and hence the epitope was incorporated into the SAPN in such a way that it remained in coiled-coil register with the trimeric coiled coil. biophysical characterization showed satisfactory self-assembly. SAPNs are purified under denaturing conditions, and refolding occurs upon gradual removal of urea. a study has also been done to improve the biophysical properties of the SAPNs. nanobioassemblies can be used in diverse biomedical applications by either using their natural features and affinities or broadening their capabilities by chemical and/or genetic modifications. nanoscale assemblies are at the interface of biology, chemistry and physics and relies on the expertise and collaboration of scientists trained in a range of disciplines."}
