{"summary": "several peptides contain a lysine residue at their C terminus with an 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thizolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide side chain protecting group (Novabiochem) this requires a special deprotection step under mild acidic conditions. conjugation of cholesterol to the N terminus of a peptide was performed by adding 10 equivalents of cholesteryl chloroformate 20 equivalents of N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIEA) were added to the resin for 2 h in dimethylformamide (DMF) 2 equivalents of sphinganine and 2 equivalents of DIEA were added for overnight incubation in DMF anhydrous. all peptides were cleaved from the resin by a TFA/double-distilled water/N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-amino cells were added to a 96-well clear-bottomed microtiter plate with 10% serum-supplemented DMEM. plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 18-24 h to allow the cells to adhere. the mediam was then aspirated from each well and replaced with serum-free DMEM containing 40 g/ml diethylaminoethyl (DEAE)-dextran. the virus were recovered (40 l) after a 10-min incubation at room temperature. they were then centrifuged using Amicon centrifugal filters. a 30-kDa cutoff was added for 15 min at 10,000 g. clones of the wild-type LAI and V38E mutant were cloned into pcDNA3.1 expression vector. the mutant was numbered based on the Env sequence of the HXB2 reference strain. the cells were seeded at 2 104 cells/well overnight in a 96-well plates. the medium was then aspirated from each well and replaced with serum-free DMEM containing 40 g/ml DEAE-dextran. the cells were cocultured at 37\u00b0C for 6 h. the degree of peptide association with lipid vesicles was measured by addition of lipid vesicles to 0.1 M fluorescent NBD-labeled peptides. the fluorescence intensity was measured as a function of the lipid/peptide molar ratio, with excitation set at 467 nm (10-nm slit) the affinity constants were then determined by a steady-state affinity model using nonlinear least squares. several peptides contain a lysine residue at their C terminus with a 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thizolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide side chain protecting group (Novabiochem) this enables the conjugation of a lipid moiety or a fluorescent probe to the N terminus of selected peptides. peptides were cleaved from the resin by a TFA/double-distilled water/N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid (93.1:4.9:2, v/v) mixture and purified by reverse-phase HPLC to >95% homogeneity. the molecular weight of the peptides was confirmed by platform electrospray mass spectrometry. the infectivity of HIV-1 HXB2 was determined using the TZM-bl cell line as a reporter. cells were added to a 96-well clear-bottomed microtiter plate with 10% serum-supplemented DMEM. plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 18-24 h to allow the cells to adhere. the mediam was then aspirated from each well and replaced with serum-free DMEM containing 40 g/ml dieth the viruses were recovered (40 l), and their infectivity was tested using the TZM-bl cell line as described above. infection with pseudotyped viruses Cotransfection of 293T cells with the pNLLuc plasmid and HIV LAI Env, vesicular stomatitis virus G (VSV-G) Env, and HIV AD8 Env was performed. Molecular clones of HIV-1 LAI and NL4-3 were obtained from the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. Molecular clones of HIV-1 LAI and NL4-3 were cloned into pcDNA3.1 expression vector. the cells were seeded at 2 104 cells/well overnight in a 96-well plates. the medium was then aspirated from each well and replaced with serum-free DMEM containing 40 g/ml DEAE-dextran. each final concentration was achieved with 1% dilution. the fluorescence intensity was measured as a function of the lipid/peptide molar ratio. the readings after the addition of lipid vesicles were subtracted as background from the recorded fluorescence intensity. the affinity constants were then determined by a steady-state affinity model using nonlinear least squares. the 17-mer sequence, termed the pocket, is a conserved domain within the HIV-1 gp41 protein core. this is a deep cavity on the surface of the grooves of the NHR trimer that is important for stabilizing the trimer. a synthetic N peptide derived from the pocket domain (termed N17) was not active in inhibiting viral infectivity up to 4 M, the maximum concentration tested. TZM-bl cells were infected with fully infectious HXB2 HIV-1. c Hydrophobicity was analyzed by RP-HPLC. c Percentage of -helical structure was determined as described in Materials and Methods. the most hydrophobic compounds were the tocopherol and cholesterol conjugates. sphinganine and palmitic acid conjugates exhibited similar medium hydrophobicity. there was no increase in -helical content of N17 on conjugation. mutated sphingopeptides were prepared by replacing N17 peptides residues in positions a and d of the helical wheel, termed N17m(a,d), thus knocking out their ability to self-assemble. in the scrambled mutant, the residues of N17 were randomized. a 17-mer N peptide was synthesized from the same region as N17. the addition of sphinganine alone, up to 1 M, did not affect viral infectivity. the complex between N36 from the N helix and C34 from the C helix resembles the central core. cells were infected with fully infectious enfuvirtide-resistant LAI strain. sphinganine potentiates the activity of short N and C peptides in wild-type and enfuvirtide-resistant virus. sphinganine was still powerful via C-terminal conjugation. DP19K-sphinganine showed an IC50 value of 350 60 nM. this amplification of fusion inhibition is not restricted only to N peptides. it can be implemented in other short fragments from different regions within the gp41 core. sphingopeptides strongly bind and accumulate in the cell membrane and in the viral membrane. sphingopeptides are strongly anchored to the membrane and sustain a potent inhibitory effect on washing. sphinganine-N17 preferably binds lipid vesicles enriched in sphingomyelin and cholesterol. sphinganine-N17 preferably binds vesicles enriched in sphingomyelin and cholesterol. sphinganine-N17 4.7 105 1 105 8.4 104 1.4 104 C16-N17 1.7 105 0.3 105 1.5 105 0.7 105 Enfuvirtide 6.4 104 1.4 104 3.1 104 0.5 104 Compound association with lipid vesicles was estimated by titration of NBD-labeled compound. dihydrosphingomyelin (27, 28); cholesterol; and palmitic acid, which is a building block in many lipids, including phospholipids. the hybrid compounds were tested for their ability to inhibit viral infectivity. notably, the inhibitory activity of N17 depends on the nature of the lipid moiety. sphinganine exclusively endows antiviral activity to a short conserved gp41 N peptide in different HIV entry assays. sphinganine-N17 (), palmitic acid-N17 (), cholesterol-N17 () and tocopherol-N17 () were the most hydrophobic compounds. Viruses were allowed to infect TZM-bl cells in presence of increasing concentrations of sphingopeptides. antiviral activity was observed for LAI and AD8 but not for VSV-G. TZM-bl cells were infected with fully infectious HXB2 HIV-1. mutated sphingopeptides were prepared by replacing N17 peptides residues in positions a and d of the helical wheel, termed N17m(a,d), thus knocking out their ability to self-assemble. in a new tab, Sphinganine potentiates the activity of short N and C peptides in wild-type and enfuvirtide-resistant viruses. the complex between N36 from the N helix and C34 from the C helix resembles the central core and is highlighted. peptides in wild-type and enfuvirtide-resistant virus Changing the orientation of sphinganine toward N17 was achieved by addition of lysine to its C terminus, enabling C-terminal lipid conjugation. the inhibitory potentiation of sphinganine was still powerful via C-terminal conjugation, exhibiting an IC50 value of 287 143 nM to N17K-sphinganine. sphingopeptides strongly bind and accumulate in the viral membrane and in the viral membrane. the ability of sphingopeptides to bind and accumulate in the viral membrane was examined by preincubating sphinganine-N17 with target cells. the IC50 value of sphinganine-N17 increased only by 5-fold after cell washing. sphingopeptides preferably bind lipid vesicles enriched in sphingomyelin and cholesterol. sphingopeptides preferably bind lipid vesicles enriched in sphingomyelin and cholesterol. sphinganine-N17 and C16-N17 had higher binding affinities to both types of lipids compared with enfuvirtide. sphinganine-N17 preferably binds lipid vesicles enriched in sphingomyelin and cholesterol. membrane-binding constants (Ka) were calculated from Eq. 2 in Materials and Methods. results represent means sd of the fitting curve; n = 3. DISCUSSION The structural organization of lipids in the membrane is a key factor in cell physiology and is exploited by pathogens to infect cells. sphingopeptides showed antiviral activity against HIV-1 and not against VSV-G. mutagenesis analysis of the peptide interactions completely abrogated the antiviral activity of sphingopeptides. sphinganine alone did not alter HIV-1 infection at a concentration at which sphinganine-N17 completely blocked infection. polar dihydrosphingosine base could favor its interaction with the sphingolipid backbone chains through hydrogen bonds (27). sphingolipids may enhance virus attachment by direct interaction with the HIV-1 envelope (6, 51) in intestinal epithelial cells, both gp120 and gp41 bind to galactosyl ceramide. lipid-based HIV peptides potently inhibit viral fusion. sphingolipids are involved in many cellular processes such as signaling, viral infection, and membrane trafficking."}
