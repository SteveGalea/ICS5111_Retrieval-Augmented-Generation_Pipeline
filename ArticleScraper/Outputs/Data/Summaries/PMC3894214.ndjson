{"summary": "RNA viruses generate approximately 1 error per 104 nucleotides copied. the genetic diversity of these \u201cmutant swarms\u201d is not detected by consensus sequencing. however, this lack of information on genetic diversity has obscured crucial aspects of virus biology. o growth phenotypes, variants that make fewer errors have reduced titers and exhibit restricted tropism in animal models. this restriction may be due to cooperative inter-variant interactions or beneficial minority variants that are missing in a situation with restricted population diversity. chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a re-emerging arbovirus, transmitted by Aedes species mosquitoes. chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has an 11.8 kB genome, of which the first 7.5 kb encodes four nonstructural proteins (nsP1-4) the implications of altered polymerase fidelity and mutation rates merit further study. antimutator strain harbored a single amino acid change (483Y) in nsp4. the variant was moderately attenuated in vivo in both mammalian and mosquito hosts. however, no arbovirus mutators have been isolated thus far. CHIKV and SINV expression plasmids were linearized with NotI or XhoI respectively, purified by phenol:chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. RNAs were then purified by phenol:chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, quantified, diluted to 1 g/l and stored at 80\u00b0C. cells were allowed to recover for 10 minutes at room temperature then mixed with 6 ml of pre-warmed media. dilutions of each virus in DMEM were incubated on a confluent monolayer of Vero cells for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C. cells were overlaid with 0.8% agarose dissolved in DMEM and 2% NCS and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 72 hours. each virus was then passaged once over a 70\u201380% confluent monolayer of BHK-21 cells, titered as described above, aliquoted, and stored at 80 nucleospin PCR and Gel Extraction Kit (Macherey-Nagel) and Sanger sequenced at position 483/482 to confirm genetic stability. all viruses used were fully sequenced to ensure no second site mutations. frquencyd Cys (WT) Stable 0.04 1.686 N/A 4.3 C483I Stable 0.73 2.038 WT ND C483V Stable 0.61 2.319 WT ND C483V Stable 0.53 0.387* WT ND C483L Stable 0.37 1.072* Sensitive 6.4** C483M Stable 0.26 2.032 Resistant 4.9 C483A Stable 0.25 0.785* mutants electroporated in tandem into BHK-21 cells. supernatants were collected 48 hours later and viral RNA was extracted. cDNA libraries were prepared by Superscript III from RNA extracted from virus generated in BHK-21 or C6/36 cells. the viral genome was amplified using a high fidelity polymerase (Phusion) to generate 5 overlapping amplicons 2\u20133 kb in length. per-base Phred quality scores were used to trim bases with error probabilities higher than 0.001. 100 pfu of wildtype and mutator CHIKV strains were incubated for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C with serial dilutions of antibody. assays were then overlayed with agarose and developed as described above for a plaque assay. titers were determined by TCID50 on vero cells as described above. RNA was extracted in the same manner using forward (5\u2032-AAAACGCCTACCATGCAGTG-3\u2032) and reverse (5\u2032-TTTTCCGGCTGCGTAAATGC-3\u2032) primers and the SYBR green PCR master mix. RNA was transfected in BHK-21 cells in duplicate. RNA was transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, cross-linked by ultraviolet irradiation (UVP) and prehybridized at 68\u00b0C for 1 hour in ULTRAhyb ultrasensitive hybridization buffer (Ambion) a plasmid used for the expression of CHIKV RNA probes corresponding to the 3\u2032 portion of the E2 glycoprotein was generated by first amplifying the region of the CHIKV genome from 8703 (5\u2032-GAAG CHIKV and mutant mice were culated with 100 pfu of wildtype or mutant SINV strains in the same fashion. brains, thigh muscles, livers and blood were harvested and homogenized in 300 l of PBS. RNA was extracted and viral genome copies were determined by qRT-PCR as described. a standard curve was generated using serial dilutions of a CHIKV bloodmeal of known titer. three- to four-day-old female flies were injected with 50 nL of a virus dilution containing 400 pfu in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) flies were reared on standard medium at 25\u00b0C. Drosophila melanogaster cells were grown in Schneider's Drosophila media (Gibco), supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% L-Glutamine, and 1% P/S at 25\u00b0C. wildtype CHIKV was generated from the La Reunion strain 06-049 infectious clone, previously described. cells were incubated on a confluent monolayer of Vero cells for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C. after incubation, cells were overlaid with 0.8% agarose dissolved in DMEM and 2% NCS and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 72 hours. plaque size was quantified by scanning the crystal violet-stained cell monolayer. each virus was then passaged once over a 70\u201380% confluent monolayer of BHK-21 cells. each PCR product was cleaned using the Nucleospin PCR and Gel Extraction Kit (Macherey-Nagel) and Sanger sequenced at position 483/482. all viruses used were fully sequenced to ensure no second site mutations. mutation frequencies were estimated (Table 1).

Diamond [66]). 100 pfu of wildtype and mutator CHIKV strains were incubated for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C with serial dilutions of antibody ranging from 2 g/ml to.0001 g/mL, or left untreated. reagent and performing quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) using the TaqMan RNA-to-Ct kit (Applied Biosystems) Ct values were determined in duplicate based on amplification of nsp4 transcripts using forward (5\u2032-TCACTCCCTGCTGGACTTGATAGA-3\u2032) and reverse (5\u2032-TGACGAACAGAGAGTTAGGAACATACC-3\u2032) primers and the SYBR green PCR master mix. RNA was transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, cross-linked by ultraviolet irradiation (UVP) and prehybridized at 68\u00b0C for 1 hour in ULTRAhyb ultrasensitive hybridization buffer (Ambion) a plasmid used for the expression of CHIKV RNA probes corresponding to the 3\u2032 portion of the E2 glycoprotein was generated by first amplifying the region of the CHIKV genome from 8703 (5\u2032-GAAG at 8-days old, litters of C57BL/6 were inoculated with 200 pfu of wildtype or mutant CHIKV viruses subcutaneously (n = 4/variant) eight-day old CD-1 litters were inoculated with 100 pfu of wildtype or mutant SINV strains in the same fashion. brains, thigh muscles, livers and blood were harvested and homogenized in 300 l of PBS at 30 shakes/second for 2 a sample of engorged mosquitoes was immediately homogenized at time 0. a standard curve was generated using serial dilutions of a CHIKV bloodmeal of known titer. flies were reared on standard medium at 25\u00b0C. we substituted each amino acid at position 483 of the CHIKV full-length infectious clone. of the 19 substitutions, 12 were viable and genetically stable. this high number of viable variants indicates that position 483 has structural plasticity. antimutator variants 483Y and 483N showed sensitivity compared to wildtype. mutator candidates were significantly more sensitive to ribavirin. virus stocks reached wildtype-like titers. the root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD) is shown (mean values SEM, ***P0.001, Mann-Whitney u test) Neutralization assay showing enhanced escape of mutators due to greater population diversity. we estimated the mutation frequencies of each variant that demonstrated significantly altered ribavirin sensitivity at either concentration of ribavirin. the mean variance across the whole genome was significantly lower for the antimutator 483Y variant (P = 0.0006, Mann-Whitney u test) and significantly higher for the 483A, G and W mutator variants, compared to wildtype virus (P0.0001 for all, Mann-Whitney u test; Figure 1C). mutator strains of chikungunya virus are attenuated in mice. low fidelity polymerase mutators of coxsackie virus and exonuclease activity deficient mutators of coronaviruses were shown to be attenuated in mice. mutator strains 483A, G, and W present significantly lower infectious progeny in mosquito cell lines. mutator polymerases synthesize RNA at faster rates than wildtype. mutator polymerases synthesize RNA at faster rates than wildtype. production of infectious particles determined by TCID50 (A, B, and C) and genome copies determined by qRT-PCR were measured at 24 hours by one-step growth kinetics in C6/36 (A and D), Aag2 (B and E) and U4.4 (C and F) cells. antimutator 483Y is similar to WT CHIKV, but all mutators exhibit attenuation in terms of both titer and RNA genomes. transcribed RNA corresponding to each variant does not present the differences in mutation frequencies of virus stocks generated in cell culture. in mosquito C6/36 cells, there was a very marked defect in replication for the mutator variants compared to wildtype virus. mutator sgRNA was undetectable or greatly reduced. fold-difference compared to WT was calculated in Image J (n = 2; ND, not detected). in mammalian cells at 28\u00b0C, mutator 483G makes significantly more mutations than in mosquito cells at 28\u00b0C. in contrast to what we observed in mosquito cells, mutator 483G also made significantly more mutations than WT. these data indicate that lower temperature is responsible for neither the replication defects nor the reduction in mutation frequencies we observed in mosquito cells. reversion to wildtype occurred in 483A (81%), 482G (93%) and 483W (39%). reversion to wildtype depended on the genetic distance of the mutated codon from wildtype. polymerase position 483 plays an important role in modulating fidelity in CHIKV. this region of the nsp4 gene containing a cysteine is conserved across the alphavirus family. this region of the nsp4 gene containing a cysteine is conserved across the alphavirus family. the percentage of infectious progeny virus surviving treatment at both concentrations of ribavirin relative to the untreated control is shown. Approximately 75 clones were sequenced per variant (*P0.05, 2 test) mutator variants exhibit significant defects in C6/36. we inoculated 8-day old mice with wildtype and 482G SINV strains. only 36% of mice inoculated with 482G exhibited complete hind limb paralysis. mutator 482G is attenuated in mice but reverts in mosquitoes. mutator 482G reverts in mosquitoes, exhibiting similar amounts of viral genomes as WT in the (C) bodies, (D) legs and wings, and (E) saliva (median values IQR, n = 10, Student's t-test). mutator 482G is attenuated in fruit flies. mutator 482G had significantly lower titers than WT (mean values SEM, n = 9, *P0.05, Student's t test). mutator 482G had significantly lower titers than WT (mean values SEM, n = 9, *P0.05, Student's t test). mutant variants 483A, G, L, N, Q, T, and W had significantly smaller plaques than wildtype. mutator variants 483A, G, L, N, Q, T, and W had significantly smaller plaques than wildtype. mutator variants 483A, G, L, N, Q, T, and W had significantly smaller plaques. the percentage of infectious progeny virus surviving treatment at both concentrations of ribavirin relative to the untreated control is shown. mutation frequency is shown as the mean number of mutations per 10,000 nucleotides sequenced by molecular cloning. approximately 800 nucleotide fragment of the E1 genome was amplified by RT-PCR and TOPO cloned. previous studies with 483Y required >350 clones per population to distinguish more subtle differences in mutation frequencies. we excluded variants that did not exhibit significant fidelity differences compared to wildtype (483M, N, and Q) mutator variants produce more lethally mutagenized RNA [6], [22], [28], [70] Mutators produce more RNA genomes and have lower specific infectivity than wildtype. production of infectious particles determined by TCID50 (A) and genome copies determined by qRT-PCR (B) were measured in BHK-21 cells. mutator variants 483A, G, and W are attenuated in mice. mutators have significantly fewer RNA genomes present in the muscle, blood, brain, and liver of newborn mice compared to WT. mutator strains 483A, G, and W presented significantly lower infectious progeny in C6/36 (P0.001 for all, two-way ANOVA; Figure 4A), Aag2 (P0.05 for 483A and G, two-way ANOVA; Figure 4B) and U4.4 (P0.05 for 483A and W, P0.01 for 483G, two-way ANOVA; Figure 4C) cells. mutator polymerases synthesize RNA at CHIKV to the mutator strains may present artificially low mutation frequencies. mutation frequencies of all viruses, including wildtype, were lower in C6/36 cells (Figure 5) than in BHK-21 cells (Figure 1B) Approximately 75 clones were sequenced per variant. no significant differences were found between WT and 483G. mutation frequencies were measured by one-step growth kinetics. difference compared to WT was found for any variant at 24 hours. mutation frequencies were compared between WT and mutator 483G in both C6/36 and BHK-21 cells grown at 28\u00b0C. mutator 483G makes significantly more mutations than in mosquito cells at 28\u00b0C. orally infected both Aedes species CHIKV hosts (Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti) with a blood meal containing either wildtype or the 483A, G and W mutators. we quantified viral loads in bodies (infection), legs and wings (dissemination) and saliva (transmission) of individual mosquitoes. CHIKV and mosquitoes were collected at 1, 3, 7 and 14 days post-infection. no significant differences in RNA genomes in (A) bodies, (B) legs and wings. mutagenizing SINV position C482 generates mutator strains that exhibit replication defects in mosquito cells. the conserved residue is a general fidelity determinant for the alphaviruses. mutator variants produce near wildtype-like titers of infectious particles. in mammalian cells, mutator variants produce near wildtype-like titers. mutator variants produce near wildtype-like titers of infectious particles. SINV mutator 482G is attenuated in mice but reverts in mosquitoes. mutator 482G has significantly fewer RNA genomes present in the brain of mice than WT. mutator 482G has fewer RNA genomes present in the brain of mice than WT. mutator 482G showed significantly lower titers than wildtype on day 3 and 5. no significant differences are found in replication of mutator 482G compared to WT. mutator CHIKV variants present more significant fitness defects in vivo than antimutator virus. mutator strains tend to generate less RNA in vitro, but have higher specific infectivity, and have only been reported to lose fitness in vivo or in competition assays. differences in mutation frequencies between wildtype and mutator strains became virtually indistinguishable in mosquito cells. mutation frequency was lower in mosquito cells compared to mammalian cells. the role that these differences may play in arbovirus evolvability and fitness remain contradictory. we obtained additional arbovirus mutators in Sindbis virus. the cysteine at position 483 is conserved in the alphavirus genus. the wider host range of SINV allowed us to test whether these replication defects occur across all insects. fidelity variants present attenuated titers in vivo that range from one to several orders of magnitude lower than wildtype virus. fidelity variants present attenuated titers in vivo that range from one to several orders of magnitude lower than wildtype virus. in vitro systems and artificial hosts may alter many of the selective pressures to which a virus would be subject. a more comprehensive understanding of the selective pressures in natural hosts is crucial to predicting how viruses will behave in vivo. the model shows the predicted locations of C483 (green sphere) and two nearby residues (L368 and T370, shown as gold spheres) that are the structural equivalent of known fidelity-altering sites in Coxsackie virus polymerase (6). modeling is weak are shown as semi-transparent."}
