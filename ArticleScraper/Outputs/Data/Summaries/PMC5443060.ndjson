{"summary": "new titers or index above 0.01, 200mIU/ml and 5 are indicative of protective immunity against tetanus,1 measles2 and yellow fever respectively, in vaccine recipients. however, for protection against disease causing agents such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), Plasmodium parasites, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Lassa virus, Ebolavirus and marburg virus individuals with pre-existing HAd5 immunity mounted lower immune responses compared with participants without pre-existing immunity. the negative impact of pre-existing HAd5 immunity was illustrated in the STEP trial. pre-existing HAd5 immunity was associated with an increase in HIV acquisition in vaccinated participants. nAbs, Ad specific T cells, and inflammatory responses contribute to different extents to reducing Ad vector efficacy in pre-immune subjects. nAbs targeting the main 3 capsid proteins (fiber, penton, hexon) have been detected in vitro. nAbs generated after a single HAd5 injection can readily neutralize chimeric HAd5 vector expressing HAd7 fiber. in vivo, nAbs targeting the fiber are less common after a single injection. in most animal studies, pre-existing immunity is generated by a single injection. nAbs against Ad are serotype specific with limited to no cross-neutralization of different Ad serotypes. lack of cross-neutralization is due to high sequence heterogeneity of targeted epitopes such as hexon HVR or fiber knob. non-neutralizing Abs can also reduce transgene expression. CD8 T cells mediate killing of Ad transduced APC and secrete inflammatory cytokines. Ad specific CD4 T cell secrete various cytokines and provide help to Ad specific CD8 and B cells. cellular responses In addition to nAbs, Ad specific T cells decrease vector efficacy. pre-existing Ad immunity may be more widespread than previously thought. most studies solely rely on the presence of nAbs against Ad to assess seroprevalence. nAbs and cellular response against Ad were assessed. innate immunity on antigen expression and vector efficacy after Ad immunization was revealed. HAd vectors with lower immunogenicity such as HAd35, HAd26 and HAd48,12,45,46 induce greater inflammatory responses, as illustrated by higher levels of inflammatory cytokines. chemokines (IP-10, I-TAC, MIP1/) also induced stronger NK cells activation. stronger IFN dependent NK cells activation can lead to lower transgene expression and persistence in vitro. NK cells mediate lysis of Ad transduced APCs leading to lower transgene expression and lower cellular and humoral response against the transgene. inflammatory responses are required to trigger a robust adaptive response and therefore a vaccine-derived immune response. nAbs targeting the hexon protein appears to play a dominant role in vivo. nAbs are directed against exposed loops on the surface of the virus particle. these exposed loops are also known as hypervariable regions (HVR) transgene from chimeric HAd24/Pan7 vectors that possess the ChAd6 hexon protein did not impact cellular and humoral immune responses against the transgene generated after HAd5 injection. in vivo, nAbs targeting the fiber are less common after a single injection23 but are more readily detectable after two or more immunizations with the same adenovirus. cross-reactive but non neutralizing Ab (gray) can bind to conserved regions (depicted in gray) within various serotypes. neutralizing Ab (red, blue) against Ad vector pre-dominantly target highly variable regions (depicted in red and blue) human CD4 and CD8 T cells predominantly recognize conserved epitopes in the adenovirus hexon. a limited number of T cells targeting the fiber and penton region are detected in the great majority of tested individuals. this high potency may result from frequent reactivation by infection with different Ad serotypes. the impact of Ad specific T cells cannot be overlooked when developing future Ad vectors. innate immune responses to Ad vectors can dampen Ad efficacy. IL-1 and its receptor IL-1R1 play a central role as they induce positive feed-back loops that produce additional pro-inflammatory mediators. the role of innate immunity on antigen expression and vector efficacy after Ad immunization was revealed by comparing different HAd of various immunogenicities. NK cells are also able to control the expressed level of antigen. high inflammatory responses will further reduce transgene expression and persistence. in individuals or animals with pre-existing Ad immunity, high inflammatory responses will further reduce transgene expression. low seroprevalence human Ad vectors were developed using human Ad with low seroprevalence in the human population. both HAd35 and HAd26 vectors have been tested and shown to be safe in phase I clinical trials. however, compared with HAd5, human serotype vectors based on low seroprevalence have shown lower immunogenicity. nAbs against ChAd6 are similar in these populations except in Africa where it peaks below 40%.14,46,62 Furthermore, unlike rare human Ad serotypes, ChAd have demonstrated great efficacy in pre-clinical studies including ChAd7 in a mouse model of EBOV infection,63 ChAd68 (SAd-24) in a mouse model of rabies. in pre-clinical studies, pre-existing immunity is usually generated by a single injection with a replication deficient Ad vector. in primates, multiple exposures of replication competent Ad over time gives rise to polyfunctional and highly potent T cells. mice with pre-existing HAd5 immunity generated by intranasal/intratracheal immunization did not experience reduced humoral responses upon subsequent oral immunization. however, pre-existing immunity has been overcome by varying the route of immunization. Tissue specificity of TRM is determined during priming by tissue derived migratory dendritic cells. IM injection probably did not generate TRM in the lung. circulating T cells are not depicted. natural Ad infections target the respiratory tract, and to lower extend the eye, gut and urinary tract of infected individuals. Ad specific TRM may be present in the lung and gastro-intestinal tract of Ad immune individuals. this may affect intranasal/intratracheal and oral immunizations. cellular responses generated by DNA primes and HAd boost (DNA/HAd5) were not affected by pre-existing HAd5 immunity. antibody titers obtained were similar to those generated in nave mice immunized with homologous HAd5 prime-boost. 93,100 ChAd63/MVA prime-boost are being tested in various stages of clinical trials against Malaria, HIV and HCV. prime-boost immunization has also been used to overcome pre-existing HAd immunity. HAd5 specific neutralizing Ab do not cross-react with HAd35,60 HAd2 specific T cells. chimpanzee derived adenoviruses are the most studied. nAbs against simian Ad vectors are relatively rare. in vitro, HAd specific T cells cross-react with ChAd vectors, such as ChAd6 and 7.34. this could be expected due to close phylogenetic proximity between human and chimpanzee Ad. porcine Ad serotype 3 (PAd3), bovine Ad serotype 3 (BAd3) and Ovine Ad serotype 7 (OAd7) have not been detected in the human population. similar to simian Ad vectors, cross-nAbs against PAd3 and BAd3 were not generated by mice immunized with HAd5. Ad35 and Ad26, have shown lower immunogenicity12,46, 57-59 and protection efficacy in the non-human primate (NHP) model of Ebola virus infection. the protection efficacy of vectors based on low seroprevalence serotypes will probably also suffer from pre-existing Ad specific T cells. in phase I clinical trials against Malaria and HCV, ChAd6346 and ChAd3,69 respectively, were found to be safe and able to generate robust, broad and polyfunctional T cell responses against the transgene. in vitro, HAd specific T cells cross-react with ChAd vectors such as ChAd6 and 7.34. bovine, porcine, ovine, canine and fowl derived Ad vectors are currently in preclinical stages of development. chimpanzee Ad vectors include porcine Ad serotype 3 (PAd3), bovine Ad serotype 3 (BAd3) and Ovine Ad serotype 7 (OAd7) have not been detected in the human population. HAd5 immunity generated by intranasal or intramuscular immunization was not impacted by pre-existing HAd5 immunity generated by intramuscular injection of an irrelevant HAd5 vector. despite pre-existing immunity may be due to evasion from tissue resident Ad specific T cells. the ability to detect Ad specific T cells in human colon biopsies and in NHP gut (Ileum, colon and rectum) is supporting the existence of Ad specific TRM. the majority of vector and insert specific tissue resident T cells will reside close to the site of immunization. nAbs against HAd5 could not be detected in the airway of a cohort of 51 volunteers naturally exposed to HAd. this is likely due to the rapid turnover of immune cells and IgA type antibodies in the airway. prime-boost regimens do not bypass pre-existing Ad immunity per se. pre-existing HAd5 immunity decreases cellular responses generated after a single HAd5 injection. heterologous prime-boost regimens involving Ad from different serotypes may also prove protective in HAd5 immune subjects. a number of vaccine platforms available, including DNA, VSV, AAV, and MVA, are best suited for priming or boosting of Ad vectors. however, prime-boost regimens are time consuming thus precluding the rapid induction of protective immunity. an important focus has been on the development of new animal based Ad vectors, especially Ad vectors of simian origin. in pre-clinical studies, alternating the immunization route has bypassed pre-existing Ad immunity. despite the relatively rapid turnover of resident immune cells and IgA in the lungs, the effect of immune stimulation following natural Ad exposure will be critical to determine whether the same or other Ad vectors can be re-administer in the airway. future clinical trials should also determine whether Ad-based vaccine regimens impact HIV acquisition. HAd5 immunization increased HIV acquisition in participants with pre-existing HAd5 immunity in the STEP trial."}
