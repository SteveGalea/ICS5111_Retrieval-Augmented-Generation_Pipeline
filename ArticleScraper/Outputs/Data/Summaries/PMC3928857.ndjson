{"summary": "one health is a concept that aims to bring together human, animal, and environmental health. the one health approach plays a significant role in the prevention and control of zoonoses. the one health approach plays a significant role in the prevention and control of zoonoses. four subobjectives were considered. the first assessed scholarly resources on the one health approach published works between January 1, 1984, and December 31, 2012. one health scholarly resources were classified as peer-reviewed publications, professional presentations, grants or funding allocations, reports from the WHO. research, policy development, and so forth were characterized as proposals for funding research, policy development, and so forth in the collaborative subject matter of humans, animals, and the environment. the target population included all published studies that addressed the one health philosophy and which met the inclusion criteria. each initiative was categorized into being conducted in or having an analysis on either a developed or developing nation based on a country's gross domestic product (GDP) the results were then categorized by their year of publication, the initiative that was represented, scope covered within the work, and geographic distribution. most of the resources focused their objectives within or towards countries that were already developed (70%). an assessment on how one health initiatives were distributed by country size and GDP was achieved by mapping and measuring the burden of zoonoses and its distribution across the world. Outbreaks or epidemics of emerging zoonoses were also noted to be sporadic in temporal and spatial distribution. data on zoonoses extracted from the global burden of diseases found that endemic zoonoses were concentrated among the developing countries of India, Nigeria, Democratic Republic of Congo, China, Ethiopia, and Bangladesh. analysis revealed P values of less than 0.05 (P 0.05) meaning that the resources, scopes, and country locale were all statistically different from the averages expected. years selected for the study showed a dependent relationship on the one health approach conducted, the scope topic areas and the represented country in the scholarly work. the linear regression showed that the scope was dependent on the year, but not dependent on the initiative (P = 0.022) nor on the country (P = 0.465). the null hypothesis thus failed to be rejected for the whole dependency of scope on all other variables. the only rejected null was the dependency displayed between the year of the initiative and the initiative itself, its scope, and the country covered from within the initiative. an environmental act was passed in 1995 in England by the Environment Agency and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency. it is likely that the passage of this law contributed to a higher production of publications. the increase in resources produced since 2006 could be related to the E. coli contamination incidents in the united states in 2006. in the last 30 years, there has been an average of one emerging infectious disease every year. a total of 335 emerging infectious diseases were identified between 1940 and 2004 [13]. agriculture, livestock production, and food safety practices are intimately linked with the prevention and control of zoonoses through the one health approach. many of the classifications which determined the scope of an initiative were subjective. some titles could have easily been included in more than one scope. subjectivity was also a limitation in classifying the country locale. one health approach has been used to accelerate biomedical research discoveries. zoonoses include american and africa trypanosomiasis, leishmaniasis, giardiasis, cryptosporidiosis, balantidiasis, fascioliasis, clonorchiasis, paragonimiasis, taeniasis, diphyllobothriasis, sparganosis, dipylidiasis, trichinellosis, toxocariasis, strong the one health approach employs disease surveillance, management, and eradication through collaboration between veterinarians dealing with livestock and wild animal populations. the 2013 grand Challenges in global health is based on the theme \u201cthe \u201cOne health\u201d concept: bringing together human and animal health for new solutions. evidence for expanded application of one health compared to separate sectoral thinking is growing. the one health approach to zoonoses remains an average priority for health care professionals. the impact of zoonoses on animal health has been neglected. the one health approach continues to be a highly investigated concept. there is a need to increase research on zoonoses, food safety, and agriculture. there is a need to increase research on zoonoses and food safety."}
