{"summary": "aminopeptidase N (EC 3.4.11.2, APN) is an integral membrane protein with zinc-dependent peptidase activity. it is known to participate in regulation of the activity of various neuropeptides, as well as vasoactive and chemotactic peptides. in 1989, Look et al. established the identity of APN with the myeloid marker CD13. aberrant expression of CD13 is observed in many diseases. a high expression of CD13 in melanoma, renal, pancreas, colon, prostate, gastric, and thyroid cancer cells has been associated with a poor prognosis. peritoneal monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells were significantly decreased in inflammatory exudates from CD13-KO mice compared to wild-type mice. they also showed that thioglycollate-induced migration to the peritoneal cavity was significantly reduced in the absence of CD13 expression in either monocytes or endothelial cells. cell lines U-937 and THP-1, the murine myeloma Ag8 cells, and THP-1 L2 cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium. all media were supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) antibodies Hybridoma cells produced monoclonal antibodies C (mAb C) or E (mAb E) were obtained by fusion with PEG 1550 (SERVA, Heidelberg, Germany) of Ag8 myeloma cells with splenocytes from a 4-week-old female BALB/c mouse immunized intraperitoneally with U-937 cells aggregated after stimulation with anti-CD13 mAb 452. monoclonal antibodies able to inhibit HA were selected for cloning by limiting dilution, expanded, and characterized. monoclonal antibodies were purified by affinity chromatography on protein G- or protein A-agarose columns. cell aggregation was evaluated by light microscopy. images of each well were captured with a digital camera attached to a Zeiss Axiovert 25 inverted microscope. the effect of inhibitor antibodies is expressed as percentage of control AI. supernatants were incubated 15 min on ice and cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. supernatants were incubated for 3 hours with protein A/G agarose beads coated with mAbs C, E, and 452 or IgG control. immunoprecipitates or total cell lysates were boiled in reducing Laemmli sample buffer. salts were removed using C18-ZipTip\u00ae (Millipore, Bedford, MA) solid phase extractions into 10 L of 1 : 1 TFA : acetonitrile, and peptides were analyzed by MALDI TOF/TOF spectrometry. database searching and protein identification were performed using the MASCOT search algorithm against the taxonomy of Homo sapiens (human) enzymatic activity determined by colorimetric measurement of the hydrolysis of the substrate L-alanine 4-nitroanilide hydrochloride. 1 105 cells (in 50 l PBS with 10% FBS) were placed in flat-bottom wells of 96-well culture plates and were preincubated with the indicated mAb or bestatin for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. bestatin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas TX, USA), a well-known cells were incubated in serum-free RPMI-1640 medium for 2 hours at 37\u00b0C. cells were adjusted to 2 107 per sample and treated with anti-CD13 monoclonal antibodies 452 or mAb C or E. after stimulation, the reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of ice-cold TBS, and cells were washed once. cells were washed once with RPMI-1640 with 2% FCS. cells were then incubated with 2.5 M Fluo-3-AM and 4.6 M Fura Red. cells were then resuspended in RPMI without serum. HEK-ANPEP-GFP cells were treated or not with different doses of anti-CD13 mAbs 452, WM-15, C, or E, for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. cells were washed and allowed to adhere to fibronectin-sensitized and BSA-blocked microwell plates for 15 min at 37\u00b0C. fluorescence was determined at 485/530 nm in a ModulusTM II Microplate Multimode Reader. cell lines U-937 and THP-1, the murine myeloma Ag8 cells, and THP-1 L2 cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium. all media were supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS. cultures were maintained at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere with 6% CO2. antibodies Hybridoma cells producing monoclonal antibodies C (mAb C) (IgG1) or E (mAb E) were obtained by fusion with PEG 1550. inhibition of aggregation by supernatants was detected visually in an inverted microscope (Zeiss, Germany) monoclonal antibodies were purified by affinity chromatography on protein G- or protein A-agarose columns. lines U-937 and THP-1, the murine myeloma Ag8 cells and THP-1 L2 cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium. HMEC-1 microvasculature endothelial cells were cultured in MCDB-131 medium. all media were supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) IgG2b were obtained by fusion with PEG 1550 (SERVA, Heidelberg, Germany) of Ag8 myeloma cells with splenocytes from a 4-week-old female BALB/c mouse immunized intraperitoneally with U-937 cells aggregated after stimulation with anti-CD13 mAb 452 (1 g/ml for two hours. monoclonal antibodies were purified by affinity chromatography on protein G- or protein A-agarose columns. Fab fragments of antibodies were prepared with immobilized Ficin (IgG1) or papain (IgG2b) images of each well were captured with a digital camera attached to a Zeiss Axiovert 25 inverted microscope. data are presented as aggregation indexes (AI) = [number of cells detected by software as blue colonies in each image (aggregated cells)/total number of cells detected 100] immunoprecipitates or total cell lysates were boiled in reducing Laemmli sample buffer. followed by probing with relevant primary antibody C, E, or 452 (2 g/ml) and the HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP, Zymed-ThermoFisher, Rockford, IL, USA) database searching and protein identification were performed with the MALDI TOF/TOF spectra datasets using the MASCOT search algorithm against the taxonomy of Homo sapiens. cells were incubated with the indicated concentration of anti-CD13 antibody for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. after washing, cells were fixed with 1% PFA in PBS for 20 min. bestatin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas TX, USA), a well-known CD13 inhibitor, was added at the maximum inhibitory doses of 4 g/ml for U-937 cells and 40 g/ml for HEK-ANPEP. cells were pelleted, and the absorbance of supernatants at 405 nm was determined immediately. clonal antibodies 452 or mAb C or E for the indicated time intervals at 37\u00b0C, in culture medium with 3.5% FBS. after stimulation, the reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of ice-cold TBS, and cells were washed once. ts were digitalized using Gel Doc 2000 by Bio-Rad. cells were washed once with RPMI-1640 with 2% FCS. cells were then resuspended in RPMI-1640 (5 106 cells/ml) and incubated with 2.5 M Fluo-3-AM. HEK-ANPEP-GFP cells were treated or not with different doses of anti-CD13 mAbs 452, WM-15, C, or E, for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. cells were washed and allowed to adhere to fibronectin-sensitized microwell plates for 15 min at 37\u00b0C. HMEC-1 cells was determined at 485/530 nm in a ModulusTM II Microplate Multimode Reader (Turner BioSystems, Inc, USA) results We have previously reported that crosslinking of CD13 by certain CD13-specific mAbs induces homotypic aggregation (HA) of U-937 human monocytic cells. MAbs C and E inhibit homotypic aggregation of monocytic cells induced by anti-CD13 mAb 452. U-937 cells in 96-well plates were incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C with a control IgG, mAb C, or mAb E, before addition of mAb 452 (1 g/ml) mAb C and mAb E inhibit HA of U-937 cells in a time- and dose-dependent maner. we incubated 105 cells/well with increasing concentrations of purified mAbs C and E or a control mouse IgG1 for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. mAb E was slightly more efficient, being able to completely inhibit HA at a concentration of 0.1 g/ml, compared to mAbs C, E, and 452 were immunoprecipitated with mAbs C, E, and 452. each blot was probed with the corresponding mAb and a secondary antibody. mAbs C, E, and 452 were immunoprecipitated by each of the three mAbs. the extracted proteins were digested with trypsin and analyzed by MASCOT spectrometry. the results were analyzed with the MASCOT software. mAbs C and E recognize CD13 in monocytes and endothelial cells. anti-CD13 mAbs 452, WM-15, C, and E and a control IgG. we evaluated whether mAbs C and E would recognize CD13 on monocytes isolated from healthy donors. mAbs C and E immunoprecipitated similar bands of about 160 kDa from U-937, human monocytes, and HMEC-1 cells, and these bands are recognized by mAb 452. mAb WM-15 significantly inhibited APN enzymatic activity, while mAb 452 had a very small (10%) effect on the enzymatic activity. mAbs C and E significantly inhibited APN activity in U-937 cells, HEK-293 cells transfected with ANPEP-GFP (HEK-ANPEP), and J774 mouse macrophages. binding of mAb 452-FITC was inhibited by mAb 452. mAb 452 did not affect binding of mAb 452 to the cells. mAb C and mAb E bind to epitopes on CD13 that are different from the epitope recognized by mAb 452. binding of mAbs C or E to CD13 did not induce changes in CD13 expression on the cell membrane. we incubated the cells with mAb 452 at 4 or at 37\u00b0C, fixing immediately, and evaluating binding of anti-CD13 mAb 452-FITC. this decrease, however, is not statistically significant. U-937 cells were incubated for 3 h at 4\u00b0C (c) or 37\u00b0C (d) with mAb 452. later, cells were transferred to 4\u00b0C and fixed. data is presented as the average Mean Fluorescence Intensity SD (n = 3). plates were incubated with the indicated doses of Fab fragments of inhibitory mAbs C (a) or E (b) cells were washed, resuspended, and divided into two. a half was incubated with F(ab\u20322 fragments of goat anti-mouse Ig (GM) and the other half in medium alone. bivalent mAb 452 induces a very rapid increase in intracellular Ca2+. addition of a secondary antibody does not affect the gradual decline of intracellular Ca2+. both mAb C and mAb E are also able to induce a fast rise in the intracellular concentration of Ca2+. mAbs 452, C, or E, were incubated for 5 and 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C. cells were washed with ice-cold buffer and lysed, and CD13 was immunoprecipitated with agarose-protein G beads. the immunoprecipitates were resolved in SDS-PAGE gels. crosslinking of CD13 by any anti-CD13 mAbs 452 and C is able to stimulate signal transduction events of similar magnitude. mAbs C and E induce adhesion of monocytes to endothelial cells. mAbs 452 and mAb 452 induced fivefold increase in attachment of monocytes to endothelial cells. monocytes were incubated with anti-CD13 monoclonal antibodies 452, C, or E for 3 hrs at 37\u00b0C. after washing, stimulated monocytes were transferred to monolayers of HMEC-1 cells. cells were gently washed with warm media and adhered monocytes were quantified with the plate fluorimeter Modulus II. anti-CD13 mAbs 452, C, and E Inhibit the Adhesion of Cells Expressing CD13 to Fibronectin It has been shown that APN/CD13 is the target of tumor homing peptides harboring the NGR sequence motif [14]. however, neither U-937 nor THP-1 monocytic cell lines showed significant binding to fibronectin-coated wells. CD13 crosslinking by mAb 452 did not induce an increase in cell binding. but it inhibited cell attachment by about 50% at the highest concentration tested (10 g/ml) mAbs C and E markedly inhibited cell binding at all concentrations tested. we incubated mAbs C and E or a control mouse IgG1 for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. the inhibition of HA by mAbs C and E was dose-dependent. mAb E was slightly more efficient, being able to completely inhibit HA at a concentration of 0.1 g/ml, compared to 0.3 g/ml for mAb C. the decrease was already evident after 2 h, and at 16 h of incubation complete separation of the cells was observed. these antibodies are able both to prevent and to revert HA induced by mAb 452. the results were analyzed with the MASCOT software. the analysis identified APN/CD13 as the immunoprecipitated protein. mAbs 452, C, E and a control IgG recognize CD13 in monocytes. mAbs C and E recognize APN/CD13 on monocytes isolated from healthy donors and on human endothelial cells of the cell line HMEC-1. mAbs C and E showed binding patterns that are similar to mAb 452. mAbs C and E showed binding patterns that are similar to mAb 452. mAb WM-15 significantly inhibited APN enzymatic activity, while mAb 452 had a very small (10%) effect on the enzymatic activity [17, 22]. inhibition of APN enzymatic activity by mAbs C and E was more efficient than inhibition by mAb WM-15. binding of mAb 452-FITC was inhibited by mAb 452. none of the mAbs WM-15, C, or E, or a control IgG, modified the binding of mAb 452 to the cells. mAb C and mAb E bind to epitopes on CD13 that are different from the epitope recognized by mAb 452. we incubated the cells with mAb 452 at 4 or 37\u00b0C, fixed the cells and evaluated binding of anti-CD13 mAb 452-FITC. binding of mAbs C and E to CD13 did not induce changes in CD13 expression on the cell membrane. crosslinking of CD13 by mAbs C and E is required to inhibit HA of monocytes. mAbs C and E clustered with Fab fragments of goat anti-mouse Ig can inhibit HA as efficiently as the intact mAbs. but monovalent Fab fragments do not inhibit HA at any of the concentrations tested. cells were washed, resuspended, and divided into two. a half was incubated with F(ab\u2032)2 fragments of goat anti-mouse Ig. mAb 452 induces a very. addition of goat anti-mouse Ig secondary antibodies does not affect the gradual decline of intracellular Ca2+. both mAb C and mAb E are also able to induce a fast rise in the intracellular concentration of Ca2+, which after an initial peak declines to a plateau higher than the basal levels. U-937 cells were incubated with intact mAbs 452, C, or E, for 5 and 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C. cells were washed with ice-cold buffer and lysed, and CD13 was immunoprecipitated with agarose-protein G beads. these beads precipitate unligated CD13 (by the mAb C bound to the beads), CD13 bound by mAb 452 (because mAb C on the beads will bind to CD13 phosphorylation induced by anti-CD13 mAbs 452 and C. crosslinking of CD13 by any the anti-CD13 mAbs 452 and C is able to stimulate signal transduction events of similar magnitude. mAbs C and E induce adhesion of monocytes to endothelial cells. mAb 452 inhibits mAb 452-induced heterotypic adhesion of monocytes to endothelial cells. CFSE-labeled cells were incubated with anti-CD13 monoclonal antibodies 452, C, or E for 3 hrs at 37\u00b0C. cells were gently washed with warm media and adhered monocytes were quantified with the plate fluorimeter Modulus II. anti-CD13 mAbs 452, C, and E Inhibit the Adhesion of Cells Expressing CD13 to Fibronectin It has been shown that APN/CD13 is the target of tumor homing peptides harboring the NGR sequence motif. however, neither U-937 nor THP-1 monocytic cell lines showed significant binding to fibronectin-coated wells. this suggests that homotypic and heterotypic cell-cell adhesion induced the different CD13-specific mAbs had different effects on the binding of HEK-ANPEP cells to fibronectin-coated wells. mAbs C and E markedly inhibited cell binding at all concentrations tested. mAbs C and E markedly inhibited cell binding at all concentrations tested. uted bioactive peptides has an active participation in several functions that are seemingly independent of its enzymatic activity. these later functions include endocytic processes such as cholesterol uptake and entry of certain group 1 coronavirus into cells. the ability of CD13 to mediate phagocytosis is also independent of its peptidase activity. molecular mechanisms involved in cell adhesion processes mediated by CD13 could be studied. we generated two hybridomas that produce monoclonal antibodies C and E, which bind to monocytic cells. inhibition was dose-dependent, and mAbs C and E are able to induce the separation of homotypic cell aggregates induced by mAb 452. mAb 452 has a limited effect on the enzymatic activity of CD13. both mAbs C and E inhibit the aminopeptidase activity of CD13 as efficiently as bestatin. this inhibition is more easily observed in cells transfected to express high levels of human CD13 on the membrane. crosslinking of CD13 by mAb 452 induces monocyte adhesion to fibronectin-expressing cells very efficiently. however, in our assay conditions, neither U-937 nor THP-1 monocytic cells showed significant binding to fibronectin-coated wells. in order to evaluate the effects of the mAbs on cell binding to fibronectin in a system in which this binding was more dependent on CD13, we used HEK-ANPEP cells mAbs C and E bind to CD13 at epitopes different from that recognized by mAb 452. mAbs C and E do not induce CD13 internalization, and they do not impede binding of mAb 452. this opens the question of the mechanism by which crosslinking of CD13 by mAb 452 induces HA of monocytes. link of CD13 by mAb 452 induces a conformation in which the sites involved in cell-cell adhesion are not exposed. the conformation of CD13 is not the basal one, as cell adhesion is only induced after CD13 crosslinking by certain mAbs (presumably by a putative CD13 ligand in vivo) signaling-competent CD13 aggregates could be formed by monomers. aggregation of transmembrane and cytoplasmic segments of CD13 is sufficient to initiate signal transduction. CD13 is considered a viable target for cancer therapy. authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest. binding of mAbs C and E to CD13 does not induce changes in membrane expression of CD13. human U-937 monocytic cells were incubated for 3 h at 4\u00b0C (A) or 37\u00b0C (B) with mAbs C and E, a control IgG, or no antibody. later, cells were transferred to 4\u00b0C and fixed. after fixation, CD13 expression was assessed by the binding of mAb 452-FITC."}
