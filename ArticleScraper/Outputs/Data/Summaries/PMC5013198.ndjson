{"summary": "metastases represent the main cause of death in melanoma patients. lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is the only serum biomarker used in clinical practice. sensitivity and specificity of LDH in predicting metastatic recurrence are low. 66a is a complex glycoprotein linked to the cell membrane by a carboxy-terminal transmembrane anchor. it belongs to the carcinoembryonic antigen family of the immunoglobulin superfamily. six other glycoproteins have been described (CEACAM3\u2013CEACAM8). CEACAM1 splice variants with long cytoplasmic tails associate with inhibitory function both ex vivo and in vivo by inhibiting the T-cell receptor CD3 complex. splice variants also enhance fibrinogen adhesion via Fc receptor and 2 integrin. ia coli and several species of salmonella use the N-domain of CEACAM1 as a microbial receptor in human granulocytes and epithelial cells. CEACAM1 is also involved in apoptotic control by two mechanisms, the cleavage of CEACAM1-4L isoform intra- and extracellularly and caspase activation [30\u201332]. MITF modulates proliferation and invasion in melanoma. mechanism involved in CEACAM1 and MITF correlation in melanoma may involve sex determining region Y [SRY] related HMG-box 9 (SOX9). function in normal melanocytes is upregulation of melanin synthesis in melanocytic cells. the results were reported as percentages of positively stained melanocytes in studied lesions. CEACAM1 expression was significantly increased in thin and thick superficial spreading melanomas. in peritumoral skin, melanocytes were not immunohistochemically reactive. the results of the study revealed an increased expression of CEA glycoprotein family in the various types of analyzed nevi, excepting blue nevi. the carcinoembryonic antigen family is expressed in melanocytic nevi, in similar pattern in acquired and congenital ones. the negative staining was also observed in normal melanocytes. in activated human tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes derived from patients with melanoma, all cells express CEACAM1 with inhibitory effects following homophilic interaction. authors concluded that CEACAM1 expression in melanoma cells was an independent factor for the risk of metastasis. in vivo studies showed that CEACAM1-L overexpression promotes xenograft tumorigenicity of melanoma cells. this results in an increase of its expression in melanoma cells that survive an in vitro immune attack. this results in an increase of its expression in melanoma cells that survive an in vitro immune attack. expression of cell adhesion molecules CEACAM1 and L1 was compared to expression of standard markers MelanA, S100, and HMB45 in 67 cases of primary melanomas, 40 cases of sentinel lymph nodes, 35 cases of distant metastases, and 12 cases of benign nevi. authors compared the sensitivity of CEACAM1 and L1 markers to MelanA, S100, and HMB45 and describe results similar to other studies reporting an 87\u201393% new monoclonal antibodies for melanoma immunotherapy, based on functional blocking of CEACAM1, are now available from cCAM Biotherapeutics and Agenus Inc. a phase I trial is going on in 2 centers from the USA and 1 center from Israel. the level of soluble CEACAM1 inversely correlated with time to death from melanoma in patients with active disease. the level of soluble CEACAM1 inversely correlated with time to death from melanoma in patients with active disease. er panel included CEACAM, ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule 1), osteopontin, MIA (melanoma inhibitory activity), GDF-15 (growth differentiation factor 15), TIMP-1 (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1), and S100B. CEACAM1 promotes melanoma progression: CEACAM1 enhances migration and invasion of melanoma cells. downregulation of major histocompatibility complex is often described. reduced surface expression of MHC class I molecules is seen in melanoma cells overexpressing CEACAM1. melanoma is an immunogenic disease, CEACAM1 constitutes an attractive target for immunotherapy."}
