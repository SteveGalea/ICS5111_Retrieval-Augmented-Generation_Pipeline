{"summary": "zoonotic diseases are a concern for all who live or work with animals. this risk is especially problematic for persons, such as companion animal owners, who are immunocompromised. only 21% of HIV patients asked their veterinarians about pet ownership. the monkeypox outbreak in the midwestern united states originated after imported african rodents infected prairie dogs in pet distribution facilities (6). no one died, but the outbreak required vaccinating 30 persons with smallpox vaccine, 23 because of potential occupational exposure (6). vets should assess the risk for zoonotic potential and inform the animals' owners accordingly. veterinarians could provide an assessment of an animal's health status to a physician whose patient is immunocompromised. if a worker were immunocompromised, a careful assessment should be made about his or her continuing that line of work. joint medical and veterinary medical workshops on zoonotic risks to human health could help forge ties. state veterinarians from 8 of the 43 responding states replied that veterinarians are required to contact their local public health agencies directly about reportable zoonotic diseases. state agencies such as departments of agriculture, environment, or boards of animal health are the usual primary recipients of animal disease reports. a federal-level, centralized coordinating mechanism would be established to improve collaboration among all the players in animal health oversight. the largest percentage of the 1,070 respondents chose \"State Agriculture Agency\" some veterinarians, 10% for companion animals and 14% for livestock, would skip the state and local agencies altogether and notify a federal agency. 76 (66%) of 116 said, \"state veterinarian,\" 20 (17%) of 116 gave a combination of government agencies. 77 (65%) of 118 said, \"state veterinarian,\" 25 (21%) of 118 gave a combination of government agencies. zoonotic pathogens cause foodborne, water, and water. zoonotic diseases twice as likely to be associated with emerging or newly discovered infections than nonzoonotic pathogens. RNA viruses, in particular, have been identified as highly likely to emerge. zoonotic diseases are twice as likely to be associated with emerging or newly discovered infections than nonzoonotic pathogens. surveillance systems should be expanded to include other serious zoonotic diseases such as plague and tularemia. long-term surveillance studies could be conducted on humans who are at risk of acquiring chronic wasting disease in disease-endemic regions. biomedical and comparative medicine research is losing its appeal as a career among physicians and veterinarians. the decline in physician-scientists is evidenced by several trends. from 1970 to 1997, the number of physician-scientists seeking NIH funding has been flat and shrinking. comparative medicine programs have been shifting from a research to service orientation that limits veterinarians' research involvement to being primarily caretakers for laboratory animals. this shift has discouraged many veterinary students from pursuing careers in research and hinders research on emerging zoonoses from diverse animal hosts. an NAS report recognizes the need for the roadmap initiative to address this issue. zoonoses are diseases of animals that can infect humans, veterinarians, physicians, and public health officials need to work more closely together to control, prevent, and understand them. zoonoses are diseases of animals that can infect humans, veterinarians, physicians, and public health officials need to work more closely. medical, veterinary, and public health schools should offer courses on zoonotic risks to human health that integrate all 3 perspectives. multiagency-sponsored comparative medicine research grants and more training grants for veterinarians interested in careers in research would increase our understanding of how zoonoses expand host range."}
