{"summary": "232 patients aged 50 years and above presenting ILI cases were enrolled. influenza viruses (44.7%) and rhinoviruses (26.7%) were the most prevalent. 14 cases (6%) of dual virus infections and one triple viral detection case were encountered. a more exhaustive study seems necessary in order to provide a more complete picture of the burden of respiratory viruses on morbidity among adults over 50 years old in the sub-saharan context. the main aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and the diversity of respiratory viruses associated with ILI cases in adults over 50 years old. all 232 patients aged 50 years and above presenting with ILI during this period were enrolled in the study. an influenza sentinel surveillance system for outpatients with ILI was established in 1996 in Senegal. the symptoms of influenza are similar to those arising from other viral respiratory pathogens. RNA extraction was performed from 200 l of each sample using the QIAamp Viral RNA kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA) each RNA sample was eluted with 100 l nuclease-free water before RNA quantification with a nanodrop apparatus (NanoDrop Lite, Thermo Scientific) cDNA synthesis step The RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific) was used. the kit enabled simultaneous detection of influenza A virus, influenza B virus, human respiratory syncytial virus A, human adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, human coronavirus 229E, human coronavirus NL63, human parainfluenza virus -1, -2, -3, -4, human rhinovirus A/B/C, human enterovirus and human bocavirus. all 232 patients aged 50 years and above presenting with ILI during this period were enrolled in the study. an influenza sentinel surveillance system for outpatients with ILI was established in 1996 in Senegal. the symptoms of influenza are similar to those arising from other viral respiratory pathogens. RNA extraction from clinical samples Ribonucleic acid extraction was performed from 200 l of each sample using the QIAamp Viral RNA kit. each RNA sample was eluted with 100 l nuclease-free water before RNA quantification with a nanodrop apparatus. cDNA synthesis step The RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific) was used. the kit enabled simultaneous detection of influenza A virus, influenza B virus, human respiratory syncytial virus A, human respiratory syncytial virus B, human adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, human parainfluenza virus -1, -2, -3, -4, human rhinovirus A/B/C, human enterovirus and human bocavirus. 232 patients above 50 years old were enrolled into the study. 129 (55.8%) were women and 102 (44.2%) were men. ages ranged from 51 to 97 years, with a mean age of 66 years. 05 (6.6%) 04 (7.1%) 11 (4.8%) Fever was the most reported clinical symptom, in 213 (92.2%; 213/232) of the enrolled patients, followed by cough (80.2%; 186/232), rhinitis (75.9%; 176/232), myalgia (53.9%; 125/232) and pharyngitis (44%; 102/232) 1.8%) 15 (6.5%) RSV 2 (2.0%) 3 (3.9%) 2 (3.6%) 7 (3.0%) Rhinovirus 12 (12.1%) 16 (20.8%) 12 (21.4%) 40 (17.2%) Parainfluenza 3 (3.0%) 5 (6.5%) 5 (8.9%) 13 (5.6%) Coronavirus 6 (6.0%) 0 (0.0%) 6 (2.3%) HMPV 3 (3.0%) 1 (1.3%) 1 (1.8%) 5 (2.2%) Enterovirus 2 (2.0 the pattern of the virus detection throughout the study period is shown in the Figure 1. Influenza viruses (A and B) were mostly detected from July to August (between weeks 28 and 43), which correspond to the rainy season in Senegal. 132 (56.9%) out of 232 patients were found to be infected with at least one of the viruses of interest. influenza viruses (44.7%; 67/150) and rhinoviruses (26.7%; 40/150) were the most prevalent viruses detected. SV A and 1 RSV B (4.7%), 6 coronaviruses (4 coronaviruses NL63, one coronavirus 229E and one coronavirus OC43) (4%), 5 human metapneumoviruses (3.3%), 5 human adenoviruses (3.3%) and one human bocavirus (0.7%) Viral detection 50-64 y (n = 99) 65-74 y (n = 77) 75 ( 56 (56.6%; 56/99) were from the 50-64 age group, 59 (76.6%; 59/77; P 0.001) from the 65-74 year old age group. 35 (62.5%; 35/56) were detected in the older than 75 year old age group. 132 samples of the study population out of 232 contained at least one of the targeted respiratory viruses. the frequency of virus detection (56.9%) among the elderly with ILI in our study is consistent with that of several studies already conducted. of the 150 viruses detected in the elderly, influenza A virus was the most common viral pathogen. influenza viruses represented 45% (67/150) of viruses detected. this was expected as the enrollment of patients was directed towards patients with ILI. co-infections found most commonly in adults older than 60 years of age. if we consider influenza viruses, we observed a circulation peak during the period starting in week 35 and ending in week 44. this period corresponds to the middle of the rainy season in Senegal. the slight peak of influenza observed at the beginning of the year is the result of the shift caused by the recent pandemic episode. the absence of nursing home services as in industrial countries, the use of traditional medicine (especially among the elderly) do not facilitate such studies in the west africa context. the association between viral infections (or co-infections) and severe signs could not be established. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors have contributed to, seen and approved the manuscript."}
